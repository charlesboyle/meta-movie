19
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,985
That ... just remember the music

I'll try to see you in the first recital and
hopefully you can watch your football game

25
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,032
You may not play this year

26
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:01,572
That would be a huge mistake trust me

27
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:05,710
I'm not that good
- You're pretty good, really

28
00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:08,454
I mean ... I miss much training

29
00:02:08,455 --> 00:02:10,856
And the chances that
I'm the star are minimal

30
00:02:10,857 --> 00:02:13,242
Yes but only tell the
coach situation ...

31
00:02:13,243 --> 00:02:15,629
Let your dad lives in Europe and
you really want to be there

32
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,366
You know ... blah, blah, my
parents but I seriously suck

33
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:24,170
But I'm serious dad, I do not care much

34
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:29,276
Well do not have to
decide now, just think about it

35
00:02:29,277 --> 00:02:32,010
All I'm saying is that
Sports are important

36
00:02:35,117 --> 00:02:37,576
Here we are

37
00:02:38,387 --> 00:02:40,922
I love this airport, do not you?
- It's great

38
00:02:40,923 --> 00:02:43,457
Yeah, I know is it really great?
Are you happy to see your mom?

39
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:47,692
If ... and to all my friends
- Ok, that's your ticket, passport

40
00:02:47,996 --> 00:02:50,299
Ok ... Do you feel comfortable
to make the connection?

41
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,303
Yes, I have to do
- Yes, but now is a connection trick

42
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:59,374
Just remember that when you land stay
someone there for you anger the airline

43
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,909
Ok?

44
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,177
Not a problem
- Ok well

45
00:03:05,348 --> 00:03:08,013
Oh well ...

46
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:11,080
Well ... seems that perhaps
and we should say goodbye

47
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,081
Ok come here!

48
00:03:15,392 --> 00:03:17,783
I'll do the best I can
to get to that recital ok?

49
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:22,298
You know ... I would not mind

50
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:25,436
What makes you say that?
- Not to be rude

51
00:03:25,437 --> 00:03:29,139
But it would be easier to not go
- How so?

52
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,134
Only it would be better to visit a
weekend which has nothing

53
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:36,547
I want to see you play
- It's because mom hates you

54
00:03:36,548 --> 00:03:40,475
She really would be stressed
if you're there and it would be bad for my

55
00:03:42,153 --> 00:03:44,385
You know ...

56
00:03:45,257 --> 00:03:47,692
Do not have time to spend together equal

57
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:51,830
Do not worry about it I will see it just
I do not want to worry about it

58
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,131
Ok?

59
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:58,799
I mean ... You know how much I miss you?

60
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,108
Why do you think even hate me so much?

61
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,143
I do not know!

62
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:06,136

If ...
- Hey do not worry, I will see to do

00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:15,655
Do not know

66
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:18,124
But know that I love you?
- Yes!

67
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,827
If I know, this has been the
best summer of my life!

00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:23,389
Really?
- Yes!

69
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:27,501

Goodbye!

74
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,666
What happens?
- Voted against it!

75
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:34,168
What? Winter? Del vote?

76
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:38,539
6 months with these people all were
agreement which was great for the region

77
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,518
So what happened?

78
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,476
- Now decided they would
like the look on that hill

79
00:06:41,477 --> 00:06:45,747
I thought it was a done deal
- I was! Virtually!

80
00:06:45,748 --> 00:06:50,107
Can they do that?
- Of course! It's been done, it's over

81
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:52,776
Sorry ...

82
00:06:52,777 --> 00:06:54,954
- No, it's so frustrating
I can not take this anymore

83
00:06:59,496 --> 00:07:03,229
I'll take that job
- No, do not have to

84
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:05,668
Why do not you?
- Work for the government?

85
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:07,904
I believe this government
different,

86
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:10,139
We need laws and is the
only way to pass

87
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,235
You are doing much good work

88
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:14,810
Well I've been thinking
this is the way to do

89
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:17,280
Ok, well then let me
remember you do not like that kind

90
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:19,549
All the time you worked
you complained to him all

91
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,084
Yes, yes ... may be a
idiot but do it right

92
00:07:21,085 --> 00:07:22,619
Things and that's what
will do from now on

93
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,087
Ok ...
- I'll be a bitch ok?

94
00:07:24,088 --> 00:07:27,424
Well every time I see this
type all I see is ambition

95
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:31,361
Sorry ... do not trust him, the only
reason we are doing this

96
00:07:31,362 --> 00:07:33,397
It is for a profit of
government and people can not see

97
00:07:33,398 --> 00:07:38,002
I care NOT ok?
- Ok I think it will be miserable

98
00:07:38,003 --> 00:07:40,137
With all the policy and commitment ...
- Whatever

99
00:07:40,138 --> 00:07:44,008
I made up my mind I'm tired of being
a fool who goes around everywhere

100
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:45,499
And looks like fall all over again

101
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,479
- Then you have to be
assistant bad guy then?

102
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,717
Ok I should take this job a year ago

103
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:55,787
And I was afraid but I
which is the best opportunity

104
00:07:55,788 --> 00:08:01,595
And paste something to your genitals, sorry

105
00:08:01,596 --> 00:08:03,724
No, I'm not sure of anything ok?

106
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:09,395
What happens to all if I go, as
François ... and ... I say they count me

107
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,971
What do you think?

108
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:12,739
Should I accept it or not?

109
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,274
- No, I have no
nothing to say about that

110
00:08:14,275 --> 00:08:18,144
Just do not want you to rush to
make a decision just this garbage

111
00:08:18,145 --> 00:08:21,514
Not only is ok? He has been
in my head all summer

112
00:08:21,515 --> 00:08:23,583

Then do
- I will!

114
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:31,825
Oh God, I wish that
things were simpler

115
00:08:31,826 --> 00:08:34,028
I mean ... everything easier would go

116
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:37,125
Always something to imagine
- Yes, the world is like

117
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,303
Oh God we finally have vacations and
girls sick the first two weeks

118
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:45,697
I know ... with the perfect son
who came from thousands of miles

119
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:51,376
Well the love of your life can not clean
after he or learn to shave

120
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:55,884
Who said that? I am good at being clean

121
00:08:55,885 --> 00:09:00,055
Captain cleaning? He who has been
missing in action all these years

122
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:02,755
What did you expect at this point?

123
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:06,162
God ...

124
00:09:06,163 --> 00:09:11,023
Oh look at them are the cute, look like twins

125
00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:16,770
Oh my God I'll take a photo

126
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:20,143
You're going to get food from the mouth of your child?

127
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:21,943
If
- Ok

128
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:26,141
This all brown
- No matter, there is a point here

129
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:35,826
Ela, is evidence that
your father food theft

130
00:09:35,827 --> 00:09:38,162
If you become bulimic or anorexic

131
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,833
Not my fault, blame your father ok?

132
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:44,602
This is a family apple
taught the value of sharing

133
00:09:44,603 --> 00:09:46,671
I love you sweetheart

134
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:51,907
How sweet, you girls

Please stop videotape

136
00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:03,589
God ... I love your mom,
you're always so hard on her

137
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,550
It is because over the years used to make me
now things are doing something good

138
00:10:08,328 --> 00:10:13,189
That reminds me, I told him a
story about my little patraquidi

139
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:19,139
Ok ... I think you'd remember
if you had told the

140
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,642
You know as a child had
a cat named Cleopatra

141
00:10:22,643 --> 00:10:24,944
And every spring jump
by the fence and returned pregnant

142
00:10:24,945 --> 00:10:29,916
And always ended
exactly two kittens

143
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:33,654
Two kittens ...
- Every time two cats each year

144
00:10:33,655 --> 00:10:37,591
I mean ... is amazing, then
one days was about 30

145
00:10:37,592 --> 00:10:42,696
And I was having lunch with my dad and was
remembering and mentioning cleopatra

146
00:10:42,697 --> 00:10:46,100
And I was like ... the most
difficult I ever had to do

147
00:10:46,101 --> 00:10:49,938
It was killing those kittens ...
- And I was like that ... what?!

148
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:53,141
Then ... listen to this

149
00:10:53,142 --> 00:10:56,867
Sometimes I had up to 7 cats

150
00:10:57,568 --> 00:11:02,217
But he had 5, were put in
Ether plastic bags!

151
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:06,122
That is terrible
- That was like ...

152
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:10,220
I can not believe I had
lied about the kittens

153
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:16,262
Well the truth ask
So you took the most beautiful?

154
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:20,803
And he began to mourn, poor my dad

155
00:11:21,405 --> 00:11:24,408
Oh said we would
wanted to see the ruins stop

156
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:27,411
If ...
- Well I really wanted to see them

157
00:11:27,412 --> 00:11:29,837
Yes but they are asleep

158
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:34,116
You know ... back to
Airport can see them

159
00:11:35,253 --> 00:11:37,018
We will not
- Yeah, probably not

160
00:11:37,255 --> 00:11:40,249
Farewell Ruins! That is so
Like great about you?

161
00:11:40,758 --> 00:11:43,320
I wanted them all

162
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:47,532
Oh my God ... we are bad
Parents, stop that

163
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:49,534
OK
- It's culture, we turn around

164
00:11:49,535 --> 00:11:51,936
Put some character to these
Somehow girls ok?

165
00:11:51,937 --> 00:11:54,539
We are teaching them a valuable lesson

166
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,574
Sometimes you win and sometimes
lost in this world

167
00:11:56,575 --> 00:12:01,913
When the girls are 10 years
rehabilitation for cocaine and accelerators

168
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:05,084
You say ... never felt
comfortable going to sleep

169
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:08,454
Because our dad used to tell us
that if you lose sleep and be your fault

170
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:12,291
Oh yes we are bad parents
- What is

171
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:15,160
Hank goodbye to suck

172
00:12:16,463 --> 00:12:18,265
Why? He was upset?

173
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:21,157
No.. He said it was the best summer of your life

174
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:25,372
Well that's great ... say
I do not worry too much about the

175
00:12:25,373 --> 00:12:28,408
We talk and know what their
main concerns in life?

176
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:30,043
What?

177
00:12:30,044 --> 00:12:32,479
Granites and how girls perceive

178
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,147
The apple does not fall far
far from the tree I guess

179
00:12:34,148 --> 00:12:36,017
I'm not well

180
00:12:36,018 --> 00:12:38,252
Oh please! Just think about it!

181
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:41,722
What!
- Women!

182
00:12:41,723 --> 00:12:44,358
I mean .. I'm not complaining,
give me enough attention

183
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:48,529
But you never stop looking girls
- Do not look girls

184
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:52,701
Girls do not watch, admire them with my eyes

185
00:12:52,702 --> 00:12:57,172
Oh .. Sure I like the
Spanish or Greek guy?

186
00:12:57,173 --> 00:13:01,304
I do not know where I am, but I'm very hairy

187
00:13:04,714 --> 00:13:09,751
Well I think ... know ... Henry may ..

188
00:13:09,752 --> 00:13:12,212
What?
- There may be a girl

189
00:13:12,823 --> 00:13:15,391
I do not know ... I think he liked someone

190
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:20,058
Are you kidding? Because you think
said it was the best summer of your life

191
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:25,295
Because ... he and I spent together?
- If ...

192
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:30,174
So ... what? Think you kissed?

193
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:33,210
If so yes, yes, swear not
say anything but he told me

194
00:13:33,211 --> 00:13:35,346
They kissed
- Did he say?

195
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:39,239
It is assumed that you
say anything - Come on! -Ok!

196
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:44,345
He said he was concerned about how to kiss

197
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:46,413
You know language without language

198
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,660
If ...

199
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:53,191
But it was ... was so cute all nervous

200
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,637
If ...
- What will happen now?

201
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:02,707
I do not know ... should be friends, Facebook

202
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,237
Hey what if they end
spending their entire life together?

203
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,749
You're so corny ...

204
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,243
I mean ...
- Who are you? A 12 year old girl?

205
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:15,655
With your first love,
perhaps remember who it was?

206
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:16,968
Sure, it was you

207
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:19,592
- Oh please as if
had been a virgin at 23

208
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:22,519
First love said no
first sexual experience

209
00:14:23,031 --> 00:14:26,033
Ok .. Okay ... I am the first
woman you're in love?

210
00:14:26,034 --> 00:14:28,769
If ... the first with which I
I felt completely connected

211
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,229
What? I was not your first love?

212
00:14:32,307 --> 00:14:34,975
No, of course not
- Oh well

213
00:14:34,976 --> 00:14:39,473
That was all I wanted to know

214
00:14:40,382 --> 00:14:43,685
Stop
- Not a big deal

215
00:14:43,686 --> 00:14:47,988
No. .. ok how old are you? -41 Years

216
00:14:54,496 --> 00:14:59,401
You are so, so ... funny

217
00:14:59,402 --> 00:15:03,738
I have to tell you that I have
a rocket in my pocket

218
00:15:04,374 --> 00:15:07,368
I'm stuck with an American teenager

219
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:12,614
I can not believe it, we have to
do all those things then?

220
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:16,349
What? Oh if we mean
much to Patrick

221
00:15:18,756 --> 00:15:20,390
For children it is very important

222
00:15:20,391 --> 00:15:21,758
No, no ...
- It will be fun

223
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,150
No, I meant the hotel later

224
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:26,756
I'm not sure
want ... hey hello darling

225
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,165
If ...

226
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,867
Oh, ok, ok, ok

227
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:32,636
OK

228
00:15:32,637 --> 00:15:34,527
Call me London, have a good trip bye

229
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:40,500
They are taking off, I asked
I call the plane

230
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,016
What?

231
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:57,920
What happens?
- Do not know

232
00:15:57,997 --> 00:16:00,899
Just do not think that
can do this anymore

233
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,200
What?

234
00:16:02,201 --> 00:16:06,435
Every summer, every Christmas and I

235
00:16:07,608 --> 00:16:11,644
I know .. It makes me uncomfortable
- It's so bad

236
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:14,639
As if we were sending
to boarding school or something

237
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:18,278
I do not know ... if your mom and I
we got along a little better

238
00:16:18,585 --> 00:16:21,087
I know ... it is as if it
devolviéramos enemy lines

239
00:16:21,088 --> 00:16:26,593
For real this time gave me strong ...
will be his first year in high school

240
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:29,326
4 years more and be alone

241
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:32,065
That's the good news

242
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:34,735
This is crucial, I feel
I should be there for the

243
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:37,969
It's now or never

244
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:41,308
No. .. what you mean?

245
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:45,013
I thought that somehow
could live with us

246
00:16:45,014 --> 00:16:49,150
Time goes by so fast and
look, already in secondary

247
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:53,855
Next thing you know will
to be running for College

248
00:16:53,856 --> 00:16:58,393
If you're right, maybe it's time, of
I really think it's time to do all this

249
00:16:58,394 --> 00:16:59,627
And ask if you can
come live with us

250
00:16:59,628 --> 00:17:03,624
I love it!
- That's never going to happen

251
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:08,328
Is that okay? She never give me something
which is not legally required

252
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:11,070
Want to call that lawyer again?
- I hate that guy

253
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:15,444
Should I call her mother?
- Please do not anymore

254
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:18,610
The child does not know how
throwing a baseball

255
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,419
Who cares ..

256
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,821
Lead with your elbow, pulls like a girl

257
00:17:24,822 --> 00:17:25,530
Not your fault

258
00:17:25,565 --> 00:17:29,750
- If so, a parent
supposed to teach you that

259
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:31,517
Ok not like baseball

260
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:34,631
- It's not what you like
is a metaphor for all

261
00:17:34,632 --> 00:17:38,059
Turn 14 and have to be with his father

262
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,003
Jessy I'm not moving to Chicago

263
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:47,774
I asked you? Where did that?
I'm just thinking out loud

264
00:17:48,013 --> 00:17:52,149
That's all that I promised myself I would never do

265
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:55,254
And I'm doing
- You are a wonderful father

266
00:17:55,255 --> 00:17:58,724
Love their relationship, love
the letters I send

267
00:17:58,725 --> 00:17:59,814
Do not read the letters ...

268
00:17:59,815 --> 00:18:01,994
- Of course you read only
you do not have good lyrics

269
00:18:01,995 --> 00:18:05,455
Just know that if I get lost
these years will never return

270
00:18:08,001 --> 00:18:09,732
Oh my God

271
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:11,638
What?

272
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:14,200
This is where it ends

273
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:16,709
Are you talking about

274
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,839
It's like people start to end
- Oh my god

275
00:18:18,846 --> 00:18:20,980
No, no ...
- You just jump off a cliff

276
00:18:20,981 --> 00:18:24,984
No, no ... I'm serious, is the
day is like a bomb

277
00:18:24,985 --> 00:18:30,925
They destroy our lives if
- Ok first of all ...

278
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:35,095
You said he's a time bomb
- Oh yeah whatever

279
00:18:35,096 --> 00:18:38,363
You know what? This beginning
if? And that's how this happens

280
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:40,862
You are unhappy and blame the other person

281
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:42,703
And end that's all

282
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,838
You say that to scare you?
- No of course not

283
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:46,574
Of course not!
- Yeah, if that's what you do

284
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:49,077
No, actually I'm surprised
we've lasted so long

285
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:52,147
Ok .. So ...
- We parallels a while but now

286
00:18:52,148 --> 00:18:54,382
We are completely opposite
I go west and you east

287
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,581
And believe me this is how it
I've seen it happen ok?

288
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:02,057
You're kidding right?
- Well not

289
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,221
I'm kidding ... and while no

290
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:06,295
OK

291
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:08,095
Just ...

292
00:19:08,098 --> 00:19:10,125
This is all

293
00:19:11,602 --> 00:19:13,859
O were closed

294
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,373
- Honey's see when
return to the airport

295
00:19:18,475 --> 00:19:20,610
Ok?
- We'll leave early right?

296
00:19:20,611 --> 00:19:22,502
Yes!

297
00:19:25,016 --> 00:19:28,249
Your apple

298
00:19:32,056 --> 00:19:34,651
Truth?

299
00:19:49,174 --> 00:19:51,743
Give me the list
- Do not I have

300
00:19:51,744 --> 00:19:54,908
It's in your wallet! And
give me your wallet too

301
00:19:58,151 --> 00:20:01,748
Ok I am the General

302
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:08,593
The overall ok?

303
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:14,824
And you do not touch anything

304
00:20:58,614 --> 00:21:01,141
Where is my team!

305
00:21:32,984 --> 00:21:35,511
Red!

306
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,859
Ok pepper

307
00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:48,633
Actually I read the
two, the first is called

308
00:21:48,634 --> 00:21:49,868
"At that time" and the second "at this time"

309
00:21:49,869 --> 00:21:52,270
The first is "this time"
and the second is "that time"

310
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:54,706
If ...
- We have a joke in our family

311
00:21:54,707 --> 00:21:55,640
That this was what brought us together again

312
00:21:55,641 --> 00:21:58,376
And that payment for an apartment
- Ok

313
00:21:58,377 --> 00:22:01,838
But it must be rare for
a man reading a book

314
00:22:02,048 --> 00:22:06,145
Why? I think I got used
- The second is sexy

315
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:10,256
When you lose the plane
and have sex for days and days

316
00:22:10,257 --> 00:22:15,060
As if there were no tomorrow .. I say
wow, really do those things?

317
00:22:15,762 --> 00:22:17,079
They do that right?

318
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,032
- I hear there's a third book and
which is more bitter than the first two

319
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:23,804
Considering that it took more time
writing the first two together

320
00:22:23,805 --> 00:22:28,039
The third one I have not read, tell my wife
I bought it but it is too long

321
00:22:28,075 --> 00:22:29,843
Even the title is long

322
00:22:29,844 --> 00:22:35,315
"Temporary members a short but
good production of a play called escape "

323
00:22:35,316 --> 00:22:37,535
Well, exactly my point

324
00:22:37,536 --> 00:22:39,754
- You're not alone, all
others thought the same

325
00:22:39,755 --> 00:22:44,387
It is a better book, much more ambitious

326
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,396
What happened?

327
00:22:48,397 --> 00:22:52,494
He said he likes all books

328
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,461
Well ...

329
00:22:56,506 --> 00:23:02,644
I say I love this place is
amazing those tomatoes are wonderful

330
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:05,380
I can smell them, they smell so good

331
00:23:05,381 --> 00:23:08,181
If ... is very proud of them

332
00:23:08,618 --> 00:23:10,900
I know it's stupid but ...
when we were

333
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:13,183
Leaving Paris was so
nervous coming here

334
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,425
And now we're about to go do not wanna go

335
00:23:15,426 --> 00:23:18,351
Because you were nervous?
- Yes, because?

336
00:23:18,562 --> 00:23:22,565
I do not know ... this place is so full
of thousands of years of myths and tragedies

337
00:23:22,566 --> 00:23:24,133
I thought something tragic would happen

338
00:23:24,134 --> 00:23:27,136
You thought someone
going to eat your children

339
00:23:27,137 --> 00:23:29,472
If

340
00:23:29,473 --> 00:23:31,398
Exact

341
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,179
All the time I've been here I've been

342
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,347
Working on an idea
about a group of people

343
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,483
With brain abnormalities

344
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:43,220
So the book would
as a day in your life

345
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,822
From every point of view only

346
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:47,157
As an old lady who has
the condition that makes you feel

347
00:23:47,158 --> 00:23:50,061
Like you're in a state of dejavu

348
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:52,631
I say every experience I have is
feel as if I had had before

349
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:55,166
I say may be sitting
here with us talking

350
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,431
Looking quite functional right?

351
00:23:56,435 --> 00:24:00,171
And in your head thinks ... not I said that?

352
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,733
I mean ... were not here yesterday taking
exactly this same conversation?

353
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,302
So like dejavu?
- Yes, but all the time

354
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:08,642
That's what happens, all it takes

355
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:11,183
A loaf, a newspaper, a movie

356
00:24:11,184 --> 00:24:13,052
She is convinced
already seen it before

357
00:24:13,053 --> 00:24:14,178
It's true?

358
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:19,153
- Yes, it is called persistent Dejav ...
is real but I can not pronounce

359
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:23,630
Ok ... and there are two other personal
with extreme facial recognition

360
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:28,068
There is a type and can not
recognize his wife for 20 years

361
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:33,202
He sees it in the mirror and not
feel connected to this man

362
00:24:34,108 --> 00:24:37,644
And the other character is the opposite.
A housewife middle-aged

363
00:24:37,645 --> 00:24:41,048
With a memory of all
faces he has seen in his life

364
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:43,818
And he lives in a huge city but
for it is a small

365
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:47,472
As a taxi passes and thinks ... "Oh that's the

366
00:24:47,473 --> 00:24:51,125
Driver let me in
the mall for 3 Christmases "

367
00:24:51,126 --> 00:24:53,778
As an old lady walking down the street,

368
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:56,431
She recalls that
sat with her on the subway

369
00:24:56,432 --> 00:25:01,303
So all those she
know feels intimate and connected

370
00:25:01,304 --> 00:25:05,140
Well I'm like the first type do not feel
connected to most of the time nothing

371
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:08,573
Hey! Eckolas! Anna! Hey guys

372
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,607
Look at this guy is having
the best summer of your life

373
00:25:22,293 --> 00:25:25,662
You said on ... this guy right?

374
00:25:25,663 --> 00:25:27,797
No. .. are only three characters
is a group of people

375
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:31,868
We are working in Chapter
now about a young man in Macaless

376
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:33,870
I?
- Well it has your name

377
00:25:33,871 --> 00:25:38,075
And this guy is in the middle, all
what you see is a transition from all

378
00:25:38,076 --> 00:25:42,380
As if seeing the sea thinks the
day will be dry and full of pollution

379
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:47,818
Well do not know ... sounds pretentious
- No pretentions

380
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:50,154
It will be funny

381
00:25:50,155 --> 00:25:54,856
He chooses a book and wondered who
will the last person to read this

382
00:25:54,961 --> 00:25:58,930
And that's funny?
- Sometimes I get something like

383
00:25:58,931 --> 00:26:02,501
Well then do not get excited
nothing, not with tits, swallow, nothing

384
00:26:02,502 --> 00:26:06,204
Just think about it
- Well not so much

385
00:26:06,205 --> 00:26:09,775
Transformation is only
seeing very far ahead

386
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,702
Ok ...
- I like this idea for a novel

387
00:26:12,746 --> 00:26:15,715
But you should add a character
of an old man like me

388
00:26:15,716 --> 00:26:18,718
You can not remember who took breakfast

389
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:20,286
But even listening to
song that was playing

390
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:24,748
When mine to Campbell Dance
Topless when she was 14

391
00:26:24,858 --> 00:26:26,201
That official

392
00:26:26,202 --> 00:26:28,888
- Ok have these people
lost in time right?

393
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:33,400
What is the connection? They will have
sex? They're going to know? Something like that?

394
00:26:33,401 --> 00:26:35,602
Not the time in which they are
lost but in the perception

395
00:26:35,603 --> 00:26:39,740
That's the deal, I put
entire novel on film

396
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:43,838
Where each character gets to have
contacting the other at the front

397
00:26:43,912 --> 00:26:47,449
You see that?

398
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,985
Randall Oh yeah, yeah
- Ok the first chapter of the book

399
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:53,377
It is a weekend in Times Square in 1954

400
00:26:53,456 --> 00:26:55,924
That lady with perpetual dejavu

401
00:26:55,925 --> 00:27:01,729
Appears on the screen except
all the time thinking

402
00:27:01,764 --> 00:27:03,365
I have not seen this?

403
00:27:03,366 --> 00:27:07,803
If ... and then in another chapter is
in 1979 film study classes

404
00:27:07,804 --> 00:27:13,209
Then we have a
retrospective in Munich in 1993

405
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,412
It's time .. As
that's not the time?

406
00:27:16,413 --> 00:27:20,583
It's time but is more perception

407
00:27:20,584 --> 00:27:23,420
Not like ...
- I think it will be too long!

408
00:27:23,421 --> 00:27:27,348
Well ... I like, do not
listen to him, he makes bikes

409
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:29,550
Send it to me in Wales

410
00:27:29,627 --> 00:27:31,756
I will!

411
00:27:41,406 --> 00:27:44,142
In France fill the tomatoes with
tomatoes and peppers with peppers

412
00:27:44,143 --> 00:27:50,140
Use the same, by
how you react

413
00:27:50,315 --> 00:27:52,114
Ok ...

414
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,124
Be sure not to fill much
it is then inflated in the oven

415
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:00,159
Ok ...

416
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,794
These well

417
00:28:02,795 --> 00:28:05,993
Especially do not listen to Stefano here

418
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:09,696
Because never made this dish
before or indeed any dish

419
00:28:20,414 --> 00:28:24,147
Stop fighting with knives!

420
00:28:24,185 --> 00:28:26,386
Stop stop fighting with knives!

421
00:28:26,387 --> 00:28:28,948
We're not fighting we are negotiating

422
00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:31,984
If ...
- Negotiating Ok this is how you call it?

423
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:39,416
It is a system which we have

424
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,801
- So they found something
that works for both

425
00:28:42,103 --> 00:28:44,605
I thought it was called having a "relationship"
but I like the sound system

426
00:28:44,606 --> 00:28:47,133
That's cute

427
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,447
We used to have that system

428
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:12,301
Not so far guys!

429
00:29:50,476 --> 00:29:54,646
Ok do not want this food
pass without thanking all

430
00:29:54,647 --> 00:29:59,784
Y. .. especially you Patrick did not have
idea what we were getting into these weeks

431
00:29:59,785 --> 00:30:04,823
A letter arrived from college
inviting us to Paleopaniese in Greece

432
00:30:04,824 --> 00:30:07,559
At the home of a great writer

433
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,087
Sure! Because there!

434
00:30:10,463 --> 00:30:13,966
And then at the airport today

435
00:30:13,967 --> 00:30:17,734
Hank told me he has been
the best summer of your life

436
00:30:18,472 --> 00:30:21,241
And I have to say the same
so thanks Patrick

437
00:30:21,242 --> 00:30:23,777
And not only so
did for me and my family

438
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:25,509
But for all that you bring to all

439
00:30:32,153 --> 00:30:36,023
Thank you, thank you, when I saw
for the first time at the airport

440
00:30:36,024 --> 00:30:39,825
I thought ... there is no way that a man
well dressed man could be a lawyer

441
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:50,071
But now ... I think I learned a
secret, we've had many writers

442
00:30:50,072 --> 00:30:53,840
The last few years but no
had more interest in it

443
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,604
I'm telling you

444
00:31:00,883 --> 00:31:05,515
It was so great to have a
you and your wonderful daughters

445
00:31:05,521 --> 00:31:10,017
And I'm so happy you could have
meet my dear friend Natalia

446
00:31:10,226 --> 00:31:13,289
That her husband was like my brother Elias

447
00:31:13,464 --> 00:31:15,198
Sorry for the Colonel

448
00:31:15,199 --> 00:31:17,867
No. .. no ...

449
00:31:17,868 --> 00:31:21,738
Thanks for including
Anna and me this summer

450
00:31:21,739 --> 00:31:23,740
Because you know that just pushes me to work

451
00:31:23,741 --> 00:31:26,632
But ... when I bring Anna
the supports me in doing other things

452
00:31:27,611 --> 00:31:29,377
Welcome to the biggest table

453
00:31:33,318 --> 00:31:35,652
How long go together
- Since last summer

454
00:31:35,653 --> 00:31:39,523
We met a year here
in my last days with Grandpa

455
00:31:39,524 --> 00:31:42,459
Before I had to go back
- Yes, I met him at a party

456
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,987
I was doing Shakespeare in the theater

457
00:31:45,163 --> 00:31:48,633
What role did?

458
00:31:48,634 --> 00:31:52,731
It was fantastic, remember
Patrick went to see her?

459
00:31:54,006 --> 00:31:58,706
When you dance wish
do not do anything more than that

460
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:04,037
The way you just said
that was better than the type of the work

461
00:32:04,718 --> 00:32:06,819
People still keep talking about it

462
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:10,289
But the after party was
best is where we met

463
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:14,727
If ... we were all there
- Very cute

464
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:19,064
So ... were tossing and turning all
night and then had to return it to the theater

465
00:32:19,065 --> 00:32:20,065
To collect your things

466
00:32:20,066 --> 00:32:22,636
And it was the best
- And I'll never forget

467
00:32:22,637 --> 00:32:25,338
We were out and had 12 000 people

468
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:27,502
And at that time was completely empty

469
00:32:27,842 --> 00:32:30,577
And she was in the back row

470
00:32:30,578 --> 00:32:34,915
So ... I went on stage

471
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:37,684
And whispered something
- It was amazing

472
00:32:37,685 --> 00:32:40,721
I could see his mouth moving
and then 3 seconds later

473
00:32:40,722 --> 00:32:42,919
I could hear his voice in my ear

474
00:32:43,091 --> 00:32:45,083
He say?

475
00:32:48,163 --> 00:32:49,997
It is private

476
00:32:49,998 --> 00:32:52,389
And then had to return
to Paris a few days later

477
00:32:52,634 --> 00:32:55,069
As you kept in touch?
- We talk on Skype

478
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,637
Every day from here

479
00:32:56,638 --> 00:33:00,809
And we had something, we put
the laptop on the pillow

480
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,837
Y. .. slept together

481
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:05,037
Oh that's the new romance

482
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:08,076
And when I woke up the screen
was usually frozen

483
00:33:08,084 --> 00:33:12,352
And Anna's face was
an awkward position so ...

484
00:33:13,723 --> 00:33:18,390
I can ask you a question?
When talking on Skype

485
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:21,631
You know ... become something crazy?

486
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:25,702
My God! These being so vulgar!
- I'm just a amateur anthropologist

487
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:29,305
They are interested in the virtual world

488
00:33:29,306 --> 00:33:33,473
Now you're an anthropologist
- Yes, the sex of the near future

489
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:43,649
And you will have virtual sex with anyone

490
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:47,024
You can program all your preferences

491
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,757
You do exactly what you want

492
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:54,532
Maybe even I like that! Yes!

493
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:00,672
I mean .. Because there!

494
00:34:00,673 --> 00:34:03,174
One of the best experiences are
to take place in the virtual world

495
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:04,405
If ...

496
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:07,212
And you're a writer like
you will feel when you do not

497
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:09,649
You can write a better
Book as above

498
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,137
That will never happen

499
00:34:11,138 --> 00:34:14,111
- I think what you want
that is when it happens

500
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:17,023
I think probably I
feel better in the same way

501
00:34:17,024 --> 00:34:19,792
In such players such as when
Chess felt when they could not

502
00:34:19,793 --> 00:34:21,994
First compete with that huge
computer ...

503
00:34:21,995 --> 00:34:24,196
We thought never a machine
would beat the best

504
00:34:24,197 --> 00:34:28,967
The human machine likes

505
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,963
You know and now we can not compete

506
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,509
I saw a doctor when they made
an experiment in a laboratory

507
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:40,814
Y. .. was wired and pressed
I did have an orgasm

508
00:34:40,815 --> 00:34:45,277
Scientists were mocking
of this pathetic creature

509
00:34:45,287 --> 00:34:49,324
While ignoring their food
and water and did nothing more

510
00:34:49,325 --> 00:34:52,126
And eventually died

511
00:34:52,127 --> 00:34:56,623
I think that's the future of mankind

512
00:34:57,032 --> 00:34:58,865
And die!

513
00:34:58,867 --> 00:35:00,935
Well maybe

514
00:35:00,936 --> 00:35:05,140
Every generation but believed
is seeing the end of the world

515
00:35:05,141 --> 00:35:07,031
But ...

516
00:35:07,043 --> 00:35:11,174
I feel like I'm living it
- Ok I have a question for you Patrick

517
00:35:11,448 --> 00:35:13,815
I think many people are
feels so ... you know

518
00:35:13,816 --> 00:35:16,182
We are like obsessed with pleasure

519
00:35:16,286 --> 00:35:17,553
Adult porn

520
00:35:17,554 --> 00:35:21,725
Materialistic seeing our
humanity with technology

521
00:35:21,726 --> 00:35:23,393
At the same time the
computers get old

522
00:35:23,394 --> 00:35:27,831
Truth? So my question is
that there is nothing to start

523
00:35:27,832 --> 00:35:31,668
Well is written in
the portals of a temple

524
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:33,937
Says ...

525
00:35:33,938 --> 00:35:36,738
Which means "anyone but yourself"

526
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:38,740
Yes but we are 99% automatic

527
00:35:38,944 --> 00:35:42,404
Not our personality or this thing
we think of as ourselves

528
00:35:42,581 --> 00:35:44,715
It is only a fraction of
what the brain

529
00:35:44,716 --> 00:35:47,251
Most have the body
fully functional

530
00:35:47,252 --> 00:35:49,053
So that's what
really seeing?

531
00:35:49,054 --> 00:35:51,922
This notion of self
is a small percentage

532
00:35:52,524 --> 00:35:54,950
As is always
I hear so much about it?

533
00:35:55,328 --> 00:35:59,665
Well it's like my penis is not as
large, it is a small part of myself

534
00:35:59,666 --> 00:36:00,465
But you have to avoid
do not call attention

535
00:36:00,466 --> 00:36:02,934
He's Jewish!

536
00:36:02,935 --> 00:36:05,904
And as you two meet?
- You do not know?

537
00:36:05,905 --> 00:36:07,072
What?

538
00:36:07,073 --> 00:36:09,474
You have to read his books
- If you especially if you want to know

539
00:36:09,475 --> 00:36:12,343
Exactly what it is to have sex with me

540
00:36:13,347 --> 00:36:15,381
Sorry!

541
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,147
I'm sorry but I read them

542
00:36:17,685 --> 00:36:19,152
If ...

543
00:36:19,153 --> 00:36:22,889
We met 18 years ago
and as we fell a little

544
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:26,059
Y. .. then lost track of each other

545
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,394
And a decade later, we are

546
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:31,231
No, no ... we crossed

547
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:34,601
You wrote a book
inspired by a meeting ...

548
00:36:34,602 --> 00:36:37,037
Yes, yes ...
- And I read it and went looking

549
00:36:37,038 --> 00:36:40,307
That romantic
- Not so much

550
00:36:40,308 --> 00:36:44,244
He was married again
- Details!

551
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:47,648
If ... That was a disaster
- It was not a disaster was unavoidable

552
00:36:47,649 --> 00:36:50,018
Ok and the first time that
had sex without a condom

553
00:36:50,553 --> 00:36:53,288
Twin! And change it from there

554
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:57,352
Sorry to say that
- The girls are so beautiful

555
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,384
They are cute

556
00:36:59,962 --> 00:37:02,630
Ok ... no, no, they have their ups and downs

557
00:37:02,631 --> 00:37:05,865
Ok .. Let me tell Anna
and keep a man

558
00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:08,471
You have to let them win in
all these little games

559
00:37:08,472 --> 00:37:09,650
Oh God!

560
00:37:09,651 --> 00:37:12,007
- When I met Jessy
the first night we played

561
00:37:12,008 --> 00:37:13,186
And of course I won

562
00:37:13,187 --> 00:37:15,544
- The foundation of our
relationship is a lie?

563
00:37:15,545 --> 00:37:18,247
And then at the last minute
let the ball hit the middle

564
00:37:18,248 --> 00:37:22,251
And gives them confidence if they
stop winning in all games

565
00:37:22,252 --> 00:37:24,421
We would never have sex

566
00:37:24,422 --> 00:37:28,690
I mean ... say sorry
but it is an almost underground

567
00:37:28,826 --> 00:37:31,261
He dreams of having a whore as a wife

568
00:37:31,262 --> 00:37:33,289
It is my greatest aspiration

569
00:37:38,002 --> 00:37:40,563
Well ...

570
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:43,471
If?

571
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:47,241
So you're a writer?

572
00:37:47,412 --> 00:37:49,747
If ... insurance

573
00:37:49,748 --> 00:37:52,082
So you write like ... books?

574
00:37:54,553 --> 00:37:58,514
I've written a couple if safe

575
00:37:58,524 --> 00:38:00,324
I've never met a writer before

576
00:38:00,827 --> 00:38:04,663
You must be very smart

577
00:38:04,664 --> 00:38:07,999
You know ... I can even write
my own name when I'm tired

578
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:11,600
What kind of books do you like?

579
00:38:11,805 --> 00:38:14,969
Well I like stories
with a meaning behind them

580
00:38:15,108 --> 00:38:16,910
As a love story

581
00:38:16,911 --> 00:38:18,211
Oh sure if

582
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:23,208
You know ... I read a book once ... Romeo and ...
- Juliet

583
00:38:25,186 --> 00:38:26,653
Yes!

584
00:38:26,654 --> 00:38:29,818
I know
- If it's too good a work of truth

585
00:38:29,824 --> 00:38:31,246
It is not a work book ...

586
00:38:31,247 --> 00:38:34,092
- Oh I thought it was a
book based on a movie

587
00:38:34,963 --> 00:38:38,093
No, not a work
- Ok it was a work

588
00:38:38,934 --> 00:38:44,905
The truth did not read everything because sometimes
I have to be aware and read magazines

589
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,374
To find out exactly what happens
in the lives of all those people

590
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:51,679
Well it is important
- Ok you are very clever

591
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,073
And I bet you have a giant penis

592
00:38:55,852 --> 00:39:00,589
Because I feel so attracted to this woman?!

593
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:05,427
And that's the funny part

594
00:39:05,428 --> 00:39:09,959
The not so funny is just
two days after we left Henry

595
00:39:10,467 --> 00:39:13,502
He told me that although I have a
amazing offer for a job

596
00:39:13,503 --> 00:39:15,137
Wants us to move to Chicago

597
00:39:15,138 --> 00:39:17,768
It's not what I said, I said I missed

598
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:25,581
Hey you stop talking, should not have
been so hard to say goodbye right?

599
00:39:25,582 --> 00:39:27,851
If clear
- And I say a child is so amazing

600
00:39:27,852 --> 00:39:30,413
If ... I did my sidekick

601
00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:34,947
When Stefano and I separate
I will ask for full custody

602
00:39:35,293 --> 00:39:38,462
It's okay for a while
because my girlfriend of 20 years and I

603
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:41,127
We are a little worried

604
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:43,697
I I love you
- And I love you you

605
00:39:47,573 --> 00:39:51,042
Ok ... I have a story that my husband loves

606
00:39:51,043 --> 00:39:55,402
And tell you all you have
to know about male and female

607
00:39:55,581 --> 00:39:57,448
Ok ready?

608
00:39:57,483 --> 00:40:02,650
My mom used to be a nurse and was
there when people came out of the coma

609
00:40:02,922 --> 00:40:06,992
Listen, it's an interesting story

610
00:40:06,993 --> 00:40:10,794
I'm listening
- So she was telling them ...

611
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:16,168
Hi .. My name is Caterina
these out of a coma

612
00:40:16,169 --> 00:40:19,163
You were in a very bad
car accident

613
00:40:19,806 --> 00:40:23,176
You'll be fine

614
00:40:23,277 --> 00:40:26,077
You'll be fine and so

615
00:40:26,213 --> 00:40:31,243
He said the first thing that every human
do or the first reaction with

616
00:40:31,786 --> 00:40:34,780
Would be to ask how are my children

617
00:40:35,356 --> 00:40:38,817
As is my husband?
Someone else was injured

618
00:40:39,027 --> 00:40:46,567
Every man without exception
first thing they did ...

619
00:40:46,568 --> 00:40:48,936
Look at your penis

620
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:55,643
You know what? You have to make
to continue there and keep it running

621
00:40:55,644 --> 00:40:57,579
You have to!
- And it has to be alive

622
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:03,318
If and only eventually
ask their children

623
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:06,688
Or on someone else who can
they killed accidentally

624
00:41:07,156 --> 00:41:11,356
Important things well
- First penis and then the rest of the world

625
00:41:11,494 --> 00:41:15,264
Penis! Penis!

626
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:18,334
But if you can explain everything with terms

627
00:41:18,335 --> 00:41:20,987
For all time women lose

628
00:41:20,988 --> 00:41:23,639
Bothering to try
change a man?

629
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,304
Exactly! What is the problem?

630
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:29,245
And they are so good giving
back to things

631
00:41:29,246 --> 00:41:33,550
NO ... only ... is like that
upset because a frog is green

632
00:41:33,551 --> 00:41:36,954
Yes! Exactly!
- Listening to all this

633
00:41:36,955 --> 00:41:40,124
I wonder if this idea of
love that lasts forever

634
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:45,019
I say we still relevant
we'll end eventually

635
00:41:46,631 --> 00:41:48,632
Your parents are still together?
- No of course not

636
00:41:48,633 --> 00:41:52,470
NO and that about yours
- We are but could divorce

637
00:41:53,773 --> 00:41:56,975
I think if they had more
money would not be together even

638
00:41:56,976 --> 00:42:01,369
God is so practical,
born in his generation

639
00:42:01,547 --> 00:42:03,248
The mother of my grandmother

640
00:42:03,249 --> 00:42:07,780
I call the whole family of 26 people and they
gave everyone something from his deathbed

641
00:42:07,988 --> 00:42:11,557
He wrote three pages on a
person he met in a work

642
00:42:11,558 --> 00:42:14,960
And only one paragraph with her husband
- Was an actress too?

643
00:42:14,961 --> 00:42:17,488
No. .. was ...

644
00:42:19,232 --> 00:42:21,862
Seamstress

645
00:42:22,035 --> 00:42:26,873
And I had some friends
wonderful and my grandfather

646
00:42:27,175 --> 00:42:28,975
She mentioned three things

647
00:42:28,976 --> 00:42:31,578
You went to war, we
moved by this work

648
00:42:31,579 --> 00:42:33,606
And died

649
00:42:34,649 --> 00:42:38,246
His great council was not
be consumed with love

650
00:42:40,822 --> 00:42:42,554
In all her husband gave happiness

651
00:42:43,258 --> 00:42:47,059
I could not agree more
that's what really helps us

652
00:42:47,362 --> 00:42:50,631
That idea of ??the soul mate
or someone who could come

653
00:42:50,632 --> 00:42:54,433
A complete us and save us to take care

654
00:42:54,937 --> 00:42:58,568
With Stefano, well, low
bar completely

655
00:42:58,974 --> 00:43:01,577
I know it will not win any money

656
00:43:01,578 --> 00:43:05,013
Definitely not
- What about Grandma? It was your soul mate?

657
00:43:05,014 --> 00:43:09,282
Sounds nice, but the truth
Your grandmother was more rational

658
00:43:09,419 --> 00:43:12,754
She cared and asked me to do the same

659
00:43:12,922 --> 00:43:14,890
We had plenty of room
to meet in the middle

660
00:43:14,891 --> 00:43:16,525
If that sounds ideal

661
00:43:16,526 --> 00:43:17,826
What is it?

662
00:43:17,827 --> 00:43:20,797
But it should be obvious that
my wife is not here today

663
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:24,599
1 people were never provided
were 2 and we preferred

664
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:27,103
That is so beautiful

665
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:31,600
I think my husband
always tries colonizarme

666
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:35,044
I'll colonized?

667
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:37,607
Yes but I do the same

668
00:43:39,251 --> 00:43:41,418
But at the end of the day

669
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:45,516
It is the love of one person
that matters but the love of life

670
00:43:45,824 --> 00:43:48,749
That's good to know because
I can handle life's

671
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,785
On the other hand Ariadna

672
00:44:03,876 --> 00:44:08,713
Hey guys if we can not reach that
hotel tonight may have a refund

673
00:44:08,714 --> 00:44:11,951
No. .. not give us a refund
- They're trying to get out of it?

674
00:44:11,952 --> 00:44:14,687
Because they will go
- It is a great gift

675
00:44:14,688 --> 00:44:17,352
But I'm so stressed
trying to pack everything

676
00:44:17,457 --> 00:44:19,559
No, no ...
- We made a deal guys

677
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,161
Leave the kids, they will love

678
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:25,998
It's a fantastic walk to the hotel

679
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:30,097
And I would be offended if they do not go

680
00:44:30,205 --> 00:44:31,405
Ok ...

681
00:44:31,406 --> 00:44:32,830
Thanks

682
00:44:32,974 --> 00:44:36,210
Iran ...
- Well ... when I think of my husband

683
00:44:36,211 --> 00:44:42,811
What I miss most from him, is the
way it was put to me at night

684
00:44:43,518 --> 00:44:47,555
Sometimes his arm
stretched across my chest

685
00:44:47,556 --> 00:44:52,552
And I could not move to
Sometimes I could not breathe

686
00:44:53,229 --> 00:44:56,325
But I felt safe

687
00:44:56,565 --> 00:44:57,966
Complete

688
00:44:57,967 --> 00:45:03,566
Y. .. strange how
whistling as he walked down the street

689
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:07,273
And every time we do something
I think people would say

690
00:45:07,444 --> 00:45:10,074
When it's cold today wearing a scarf

691
00:45:10,814 --> 00:45:17,175
But lately I
forgetting small things

692
00:45:17,187 --> 00:45:21,887
Everything is starting to fade
and I'm starting to forget

693
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,928
And it's like that ...

694
00:45:24,929 --> 00:45:31,201
As well lose it again
sometimes I remember

695
00:45:31,202 --> 00:45:35,299
Every detail of his face

696
00:45:35,506 --> 00:45:40,211
Her eyes her lips her teeth

697
00:45:40,212 --> 00:45:42,313
His hair his skin

698
00:45:42,314 --> 00:45:44,739
But now it is no longer

699
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:49,748
And sometimes ... sometimes but not always

700
00:45:49,821 --> 00:45:52,256
I can see it

701
00:45:52,257 --> 00:45:56,616
As if a cloud moved and the
is there like you could almost touch it

702
00:45:56,862 --> 00:46:00,799
But then ... enters the real world

703
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,794
And he vanishes again

704
00:46:04,103 --> 00:46:08,907
But I do this every morning when
the sun is not so bright outside

705
00:46:08,908 --> 00:46:12,277
But the sun is as
makes it disappears

706
00:46:13,279 --> 00:46:19,852
And comes and goes as the
sun when it rises and when it gets

707
00:46:19,853 --> 00:46:23,051
Whatever ...

708
00:46:24,858 --> 00:46:26,725
It's like life

709
00:46:29,063 --> 00:46:31,164
We appear and disappear

710
00:46:31,165 --> 00:46:34,034
And we are so important to some

711
00:46:34,703 --> 00:46:38,561
But we are just ... passing

712
00:46:42,177 --> 00:46:44,568
Passing

713
00:46:45,146 --> 00:46:47,776
We're just going

714
00:46:56,392 --> 00:47:00,261
And eventually sees her face
the reflection of the window

715
00:47:00,262 --> 00:47:05,333
And he realizes that it is not a
9 year old boy has a beard

716
00:47:05,334 --> 00:47:08,069
And his eyes are with tears
- This sounds sad

717
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,805
At first I thought you were going to tell a

718
00:47:09,806 --> 00:47:11,540
History of the kind that
has an imaginary friend

719
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:13,028
What?

720
00:47:13,029 --> 00:47:16,002
- When in his years
50 his imaginary friend

721
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,939
If that!
- You like that?

722
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:24,387
Remember that letter you left me read
you wrote when you were like 20 years

723
00:47:24,388 --> 00:47:26,790
Yourself for 40 years
- Yes, I remember the first sentence

724
00:47:26,791 --> 00:47:29,326
Dear Jessy 40 years
hope you're not divorced

725
00:47:29,327 --> 00:47:33,026
Not even remember that part I meant
to all the other things in the letter

726
00:47:33,331 --> 00:47:36,900
You always say the same type
believe that we are evolving

727
00:47:36,901 --> 00:47:38,268
But we can not change much to say

728
00:47:38,369 --> 00:47:40,604
You know I think I've changed a lot
- How so?

729
00:47:40,605 --> 00:47:43,540
When I was younger
wanted time to speed

730
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:44,542
Why?

731
00:47:44,543 --> 00:47:46,944
Good to be alone,
to be free from my parents

732
00:47:46,945 --> 00:47:51,441
For school and stuff, I just wanted to close
eyes and wake up as an adult

733
00:47:51,784 --> 00:47:54,982
And now I feel that this step and
I want everything to slow

734
00:47:55,454 --> 00:47:59,290
It's rare I always had the feeling
that no matter where in my life

735
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:02,752
It is a memory or a dream
- Always talk about it

736
00:48:03,129 --> 00:48:07,329
I also like
was happening right now

737
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,265
It's happening
- I know!

738
00:48:09,602 --> 00:48:13,172
Every year it seems that I get
more humble and more overwhelmed

739
00:48:13,173 --> 00:48:15,541
These are all things that
ever know or understand

740
00:48:15,542 --> 00:48:19,379
That's what you say you know nothing
- I know, I know! But I'm getting better

741
00:48:19,747 --> 00:48:21,681
But not knowing things is not so bad

742
00:48:21,682 --> 00:48:22,916
I mean ...

743
00:48:22,917 --> 00:48:26,081
The point is to look

744
00:48:26,253 --> 00:48:27,320
Keeping the mood

745
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,586
I do not know ... I only wish
make it easier

746
00:48:29,757 --> 00:48:33,259
What do you mean?
- Just to maintain a certain level of passion

747
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,629
We used to be so natural

748
00:48:36,897 --> 00:48:39,266
Remember when I was younger,
my writer friends and I

749
00:48:39,401 --> 00:48:42,369
We used ... just felt like it
were doing something important

750
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:43,904
You know? That was our time

751
00:48:43,905 --> 00:48:46,974
- But they were all a lot
arrogant idiots right?

752
00:48:46,975 --> 00:48:50,878
No! Okay maybe ... do not know .. Single
than where would we get all that energy

753
00:48:50,879 --> 00:48:54,950
All that creativity and
ambition that all people had

754
00:48:54,951 --> 00:48:58,445
You need to be a little crazy
to keep you motivated

755
00:48:59,021 --> 00:49:01,651
Young people do that all
time comparing each

756
00:49:02,325 --> 00:49:05,819
Are signals for
which are judged each

757
00:49:05,828 --> 00:49:07,627
You used to do that all the time
- What else?

758
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:10,960
You were talking about more than when you were 17 years

759
00:49:15,172 --> 00:49:18,140
Yes but women do not think so
- Do not you think?

760
00:49:18,141 --> 00:49:20,566
No. .. that we have much to compare

761
00:49:21,311 --> 00:49:23,913
Most women
would do anything in life

762
00:49:23,914 --> 00:49:26,213
The first time
hear of them have 50

763
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:28,512
Years because it is so difficult
have recognition

764
00:49:29,253 --> 00:49:33,557
They fight for 30 years at home raising children

765
00:49:33,558 --> 00:49:35,516
Before you can do what you want to do

766
00:49:36,594 --> 00:49:39,429
Actually you know what? It's free

767
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:42,599
We need not spend our lives
comparing us to Martin Luther King

768
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:46,136
Ghandi ... Tolstoy
- What about Joan of Arc?

769
00:49:46,137 --> 00:49:49,166
I mean ... she was a
teen and except to France

770
00:49:49,808 --> 00:49:52,477
Who wants to be her, forget to France

771
00:49:52,478 --> 00:49:55,278
She was burned at the
stake and still a virgin!

772
00:49:55,447 --> 00:49:58,475
Ok? Nothing I aspire to that great achievement

773
00:50:01,487 --> 00:50:04,287
Oh God ... -
What? -Do nothing

774
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:07,719
What?
- This is so weird

775
00:50:08,295 --> 00:50:13,792
What do you mean?
- This, we walk and talk

776
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,503
About something other than food, work

777
00:50:17,504 --> 00:50:19,633
I mean when was the last time
things were out there talking

778
00:50:21,341 --> 00:50:24,244
Hear what I hear?

779
00:50:24,245 --> 00:50:26,346
The sea?
- No

780
00:50:26,347 --> 00:50:29,082
What? Oh! No small feet

781
00:50:29,083 --> 00:50:31,618
Nothing ... things being thrown to the ground

782
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:34,955
Nothing we have
clean any injustice

783
00:50:34,956 --> 00:50:37,256
If ... when was the last time?

784
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,859
When we did not have in
Nowhere to be?

785
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,853
If ...

786
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:47,034
I used to kick your ass in ping
pong in those concrete tables

787
00:50:47,035 --> 00:50:49,403
Congrats! You beat a
pregnant woman with twins

788
00:50:49,404 --> 00:50:52,039
It is better to lose a
pregnant woman with twins

789
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,772
If ... O God!

790
00:50:55,043 --> 00:50:59,514
You know I think? I think it's time
we left the house of our fathers

791
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:04,011
Until we have children is the only
Once your life is entirely yours

792
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:09,458
I think I've had as a decade that

793
00:51:09,459 --> 00:51:11,727
One day, a week, a
year there is no big difference

794
00:51:11,728 --> 00:51:14,995
If ... I know, I used to spend
work time watching

795
00:51:15,131 --> 00:51:18,368
And boyfriends and stuff I can now tell you

796
00:51:18,369 --> 00:51:21,704
Every detail of the last seven years based
on what happens in the lives of girls

797
00:51:21,705 --> 00:51:23,840
If ... clear

798
00:51:23,841 --> 00:51:26,442
You do the same?
- Yes, if

799
00:51:26,443 --> 00:51:28,343
I say the time is now marked

800
00:51:28,344 --> 00:51:32,145
- No, I just feel
surprised you do that too

801
00:51:32,316 --> 00:51:34,250
Ok ... rapid test

802
00:51:34,251 --> 00:51:36,420
August 2009

803
00:51:36,421 --> 00:51:40,524
No, come on! It was going fast?

804
00:51:40,525 --> 00:51:43,994
August 2009 were
Holiday with your parents

805
00:51:43,995 --> 00:51:46,590
A Nía had chickenpox and
quickly spread to Ela

806
00:51:47,165 --> 00:51:50,432
I am so impressed
- If you give me a gold star?

807
00:51:50,635 --> 00:51:53,095
Perhaps

808
00:51:53,272 --> 00:51:55,840
Hey ... I can ask you a question?
- Insurance

809
00:51:55,841 --> 00:51:59,802
If we met for the first time
on a train find me attractive?

810
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,049
Clear
- No, but now as I am

811
00:52:07,687 --> 00:52:08,953
I really talk to? I would ask
I get off the train with you?

812
00:52:08,954 --> 00:52:15,021
I say this by asking a question
theoretical, what my situation?

813
00:52:15,195 --> 00:52:17,063
Technically it would not be cheating?

814
00:52:17,064 --> 00:52:19,482
Ok because you can not say that if?

815
00:52:19,483 --> 00:52:21,901
- I wanted to say something
malograste romantic and ok?

816
00:52:21,902 --> 00:52:25,271
Ok, ok ... expected if I saw you on a train

817
00:52:25,272 --> 00:52:29,876
Ok listen I would be looking at you and say ...

818
00:52:29,877 --> 00:52:33,337
These putting so hot
like an egg in a pot

819
00:52:33,381 --> 00:52:36,783
Stop! That's disgusting!

820
00:52:36,784 --> 00:52:39,536
No! The truth is that you failed the test and the

821
00:52:39,537 --> 00:52:42,289
Fact is that I
you invite to go on a train

822
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:45,293
I do not even notaries,
one middle-aged mom

823
00:52:45,294 --> 00:52:48,595
Losing hair
- Ok ...

824
00:52:48,831 --> 00:52:52,066
Yes, that's me
- I put a trap to fail

825
00:52:52,067 --> 00:52:54,802
Ok true

826
00:52:54,803 --> 00:52:59,207
But in the real world bald

827
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:03,909
If you talk on a train I did
and it was the best I could do

828
00:53:03,913 --> 00:53:06,838
Really? Look at the goats

829
00:53:09,919 --> 00:53:14,022
You know not even
a real question

830
00:53:14,023 --> 00:53:17,659
If you are invited you to get off the train

831
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,595
If ...
- I bajarías me?

832
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:21,931
Of course not, I have people waiting

833
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:26,870
A man of 41 years
one hormone 15

834
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:30,069
How horrible! I'm scared now helps!

835
00:53:30,808 --> 00:53:35,645
I can not believe I have 41 years
- Yeah, me neither're so old

836
00:53:35,646 --> 00:53:37,814
Never thought I would sleep with
someone who has more than 40 years

837
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:38,750
If ...

838
00:53:38,751 --> 00:53:40,618
- You know what? You are the most
old with whom I slept

839
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:42,686
That is something
- True

840
00:53:42,687 --> 00:53:44,611
I know I'm the older guy
when you've done oral sex

841
00:53:44,623 --> 00:53:48,288
What!
- The conference in Warsaw

842
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,618
That conference?

843
00:53:51,329 --> 00:53:56,635
Lech Walesa! Are you talking about?
- It was before we're together

844
00:53:56,636 --> 00:54:00,806
You can not admit it? I can
remember how you talked

845
00:54:00,807 --> 00:54:04,442
As he opened your heart,
definitely did oral sex

846
00:54:04,443 --> 00:54:06,611
Ok ... 're crazy!

847
00:54:06,612 --> 00:54:08,146
That was Gorber Shoved

848
00:54:08,147 --> 00:54:13,143
Ok? American obsessed with football

849
00:54:14,354 --> 00:54:16,088
Sorry I got confused

850
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:19,625
And I did not do oral sex ok? Take it back

851
00:54:19,626 --> 00:54:20,560
Ok, ok

852
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:22,485
God!

853
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:25,125
Then went to another?

854
00:54:25,299 --> 00:54:28,600
Well guess what?

855
00:54:29,203 --> 00:54:34,575
Listen to this .. I was going to wait to tell you this
to later but already enough secrets

856
00:54:34,576 --> 00:54:37,578
What? You have a tumor in
the brain going to die?

857
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:38,579
No no

858
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,947
Nothing like

859
00:54:39,981 --> 00:54:43,111
Well the truth is something

860
00:54:43,451 --> 00:54:45,085
My grandmother died
- What! When?

861
00:54:45,086 --> 00:54:48,182
Yes, my dad sent me an
text before we eat

862
00:54:48,389 --> 00:54:50,621
Oh I'm sorry because
could not you tell me?!

863
00:54:50,626 --> 00:54:53,962
Everyone has been waiting for, lived
a long time had a great life

864
00:54:53,963 --> 00:54:56,081
He was 96

865
00:54:56,082 --> 00:54:58,199
- Not much later lived
that your grandfather died

866
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:03,471
No. .. just a year ... the funny
is that this woman was a saint ok?

867
00:55:03,472 --> 00:55:07,274
She was a nurse in the war
We take care of all of us

868
00:55:07,277 --> 00:55:10,613
You know ... never said anything bad about anyone

869
00:55:10,614 --> 00:55:12,348
I wish you have imported
- It's OK

870
00:55:12,349 --> 00:55:16,344
Okay, because in the end no
I wanted to meet new people

871
00:55:16,553 --> 00:55:21,657
I say after a lifetime of being the
sweeter once you grandfather died

872
00:55:21,658 --> 00:55:23,425
As you ... I do not know, put something bitter

873
00:55:23,426 --> 00:55:25,428
Really? What happens is that he was in mourning

874
00:55:25,429 --> 00:55:28,855
Yeah well my dad says
was waiting to die

875
00:55:29,467 --> 00:55:31,201
How long were you married?

876
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:33,169
74 years

877
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:36,801
Shit! How is that possible

878
00:55:37,942 --> 00:55:40,776
How old would be if
we were to be together 74 years

879
00:55:41,812 --> 00:55:44,282
Well since when we would start to count?

880
00:55:44,283 --> 00:55:46,884
I guess that since the
first time we had sex

881
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:47,852
Ok ...

882
00:55:47,853 --> 00:55:50,949
If great so ... 1994

883
00:55:51,456 --> 00:55:54,484
Ok ... 1994 ...

884
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:59,253
56 years from now
- We would have 98

885
00:56:02,035 --> 00:56:04,770
You could put up with me for another 56 years more?

886
00:56:04,771 --> 00:56:08,140
I have to know because
I do not know if I can you

887
00:56:08,141 --> 00:56:11,601
It's crazy if you think
all changes you saw

888
00:56:11,611 --> 00:56:13,876
When they met
none had electricity

889
00:56:14,013 --> 00:56:16,782
He used to take her to school on her horse

890
00:56:16,783 --> 00:56:20,186
When he was graduated Victorian

891
00:56:20,187 --> 00:56:23,523
What's that?
- It was the first class and her second

892
00:56:23,524 --> 00:56:27,293
I bet it toward some things
evil that he does not feel threatened

893
00:56:27,294 --> 00:56:29,685
No, if you wanted to have sex and had to be

894
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:31,865
Yes, obviously you know who

895
00:56:31,866 --> 00:56:35,736
- Anyway, I called my
Pope just to say

896
00:56:35,737 --> 00:56:40,441
I was sorry and that but I think
the jodi somewhere said ...

897
00:56:40,442 --> 00:56:44,011
Hey Pope're an orphan now,
I do not think it was funny

898
00:56:44,012 --> 00:56:46,277
Not funny at all
- Yeah, I guess not

899
00:56:46,681 --> 00:56:48,912
The following is then your

900
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:53,153
Well ... told me that my grandparents
wanted to have something both together

901
00:56:53,154 --> 00:56:56,458
They wanted to have his ashes
mix and be buried as one

902
00:56:56,459 --> 00:57:01,463
Your grandfather did not have a funeral?
- They said they did not want that

903
00:57:01,464 --> 00:57:04,924
Oh yeah ... I kind of like the
idea that you come to my funeral

904
00:57:05,601 --> 00:57:10,071
What?
- No, I know ... I imagine your in a suit

905
00:57:10,072 --> 00:57:13,642
Clean-shaven holding hands
with the girls, do not know, I like

906
00:57:13,643 --> 00:57:15,840
You are safe to do so
- We'll see

907
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,572
I guess one of the two vera

908
00:57:18,782 --> 00:57:21,317
Think I want to go to service me?

909
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:25,017
A Texas?
- Not in Paris

910
00:57:25,188 --> 00:57:28,792
Ok how much you want to go?
I want to go but it is very expensive

911
00:57:28,793 --> 00:57:32,492
With flights ..
- It would be simpler to just go

912
00:57:32,663 --> 00:57:34,724
Oh hello!

913
00:57:34,732 --> 00:57:38,035
Well you know if I'm not there would
easier lame you your cousins

914
00:57:38,036 --> 00:57:41,564
If ... that's true
- That's not common where you come from?

915
00:57:42,106 --> 00:57:44,674
You did not answer the question
- What question?

916
00:57:44,675 --> 00:57:48,170
Well ... could put up
other 56 years more?

917
00:57:48,814 --> 00:57:52,445
I look forward
- Shit, I really do it right

918
00:57:52,551 --> 00:57:56,409
The nectar of your years
is like a thin line

919
00:57:58,123 --> 00:58:00,047
My Spanish lover hairy back

920
00:58:02,494 --> 00:58:04,522
Watch this

921
00:58:05,498 --> 00:58:08,890
This place reminds me of a movie
I saw as a teenager

922
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,804
It is a black and white film of the year

923
00:58:11,805 --> 00:58:14,640
Remember a couple walking through Pompeii

924
00:58:14,641 --> 00:58:17,509
Viewing bodies that had
been lying there for centuries

925
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:22,013
I remember the bodies
even holding and loving

926
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:26,719
Do not know why, sometimes I have
this picture in my mind

927
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,222
Where, you know, I'm asleep and I embrace

928
00:58:29,223 --> 00:58:32,625
Well ... be buried under
earth? That's what you think?

929
00:58:32,626 --> 00:58:33,827
Yes!

930
00:58:33,828 --> 00:58:36,429
That's not funny!

931
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:40,868
I do not know .. It is horrible
corpses had children say

932
00:58:40,869 --> 00:58:43,070
That's cute

933
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:45,373
Yeah, I guess I was young and somewhat morbid,

934
00:58:45,374 --> 00:58:47,675
I mean at that age think
to die with someone you love

935
00:58:47,676 --> 00:58:52,146
Now you die with me?
- Perhaps you know if you ... you know

936
00:58:52,147 --> 00:58:57,314
Our first night together
a while but now ... no!

937
00:58:57,319 --> 00:58:58,753
Want to go!

938
00:58:58,754 --> 00:59:00,622
Because you can not say something romantic?!

939
00:59:00,623 --> 00:59:03,321
Oh no!

940
00:59:03,392 --> 00:59:05,919
Ok if you want you can ask me again

941
00:59:06,162 --> 00:59:09,554
But no sooner

942
00:59:10,099 --> 00:59:11,833
Sorry

943
00:59:11,834 --> 00:59:16,501
Ok ... Chapel is telling you
has about 1000 years old

944
00:59:16,507 --> 00:59:19,542
You can get in?
- Yes, I think

945
00:59:19,543 --> 00:59:21,740
Watch this

946
00:59:29,653 --> 00:59:33,046
People come from everywhere and
leave their dedications to the blind

947
00:59:33,224 --> 00:59:35,023
To help restore sight

948
00:59:37,428 --> 00:59:42,128
And these pictures here make me
think about Japanese monks

949
00:59:43,568 --> 00:59:45,836
I like to paint with water and rock

950
00:59:45,837 --> 00:59:48,438
For when you finish and will have evaporated

951
00:59:48,439 --> 00:59:51,743
As slanted eyes
that's about blindness?

952
00:59:51,744 --> 00:59:53,745
No. .. not that

953
00:59:53,746 --> 00:59:58,446
But a guy told me that the Turks
did that during the occupation

954
00:59:59,251 --> 01:00:01,881
That's it? Never eat
Turkish food again

955
01:00:02,555 --> 01:00:04,522
Oh ok

956
01:00:04,523 --> 01:00:06,424
That will be good for the
international community

957
01:00:06,425 --> 01:00:09,420
Ok ... okay then
never suck another cock turkish

958
01:00:09,896 --> 01:00:12,865
Ok that will have a global impact

959
01:00:12,866 --> 01:00:18,966
Oh that's terrible, forget it's bad
make oral sex jokes in a church

960
01:00:29,684 --> 01:00:32,485
The girls asked me to
again as was our wedding

961
01:00:32,486 --> 01:00:34,120
If? What did you say?

962
01:00:34,121 --> 01:00:37,057
I said I was ... fairly simple

963
01:00:37,058 --> 01:00:39,483
But at least you can still remember

964
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,695
Very fast

965
01:00:41,696 --> 01:00:43,730
I do not know because they want to get married

966
01:00:43,731 --> 01:00:45,656
It is important for them

967
01:00:45,834 --> 01:00:49,237
We want to get married in a church?
- No

968
01:00:49,238 --> 01:00:51,239
It's all those tales
fairy that they like both

969
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:57,845
Remember when you were small and
after each drawing they saw

970
01:00:57,846 --> 01:01:00,381
There was a "marry"

971
01:01:00,382 --> 01:01:04,446
Even if it was Pinocchio and his
potato or duck and his nephews Don

972
01:01:09,325 --> 01:01:12,527
So if we are to
spend another 56 years together

973
01:01:12,528 --> 01:01:14,452
If ...
- Who else would like to change about me?

974
01:01:15,832 --> 01:01:16,588
What?

975
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,100
- It's another one of your questions
in which I can not win

976
01:01:18,101 --> 01:01:20,336
I will not answer that
- What do you mean?!

977
01:01:20,337 --> 01:01:22,602
There is one thing that
like to change about myself?

978
01:01:23,107 --> 01:01:26,576
I'm perfect?
- Ok the truth

979
01:01:26,577 --> 01:01:32,244
If you could change one thing about you is
you let me try to change me

980
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:35,213
You are a very manipulative man know that?

981
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,789
I know how you operate
- You think?

982
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:41,852
Yeah, everything about you, come on over here

983
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:44,860
Do not think you know the truth
- No?

984
01:01:44,996 --> 01:01:47,864
Well ... I know you better
than anyone on the planet

985
01:01:48,533 --> 01:01:50,301
Maybe that's not saying much

986
01:01:50,302 --> 01:01:55,440
This is great, I feel close
to you, but sometimes not ...

987
01:01:55,441 --> 01:01:58,243
I feel as if ... were
breathing helium and oxygen

988
01:01:58,244 --> 01:02:00,812
What makes you say that?

989
01:02:00,813 --> 01:02:03,909
See? I try to connect to
truth and make a joke!

990
01:02:05,184 --> 01:02:06,985
No!
- Is exactly Spoken

991
01:02:06,986 --> 01:02:09,921
Let if we know each other

992
01:02:09,922 --> 01:02:12,883
I think we could say
know each other better first

993
01:02:14,561 --> 01:02:16,529
If ...

994
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:19,990
Remember to friend
mine, George of New York?

995
01:02:20,233 --> 01:02:21,734
NO ...

996
01:02:21,735 --> 01:02:25,638
Oh no, that was before ... no, no, as

997
01:02:25,639 --> 01:02:28,140
He was a friend of mine that when
learned that he had leukemia

998
01:02:28,141 --> 01:02:32,879
And he was dying he confessed that
the first thing that came to mind

999
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,514
Is relief
- Relief?

1000
01:02:34,515 --> 01:02:37,818
If ... well ... before
unknowingly had nine months to live

1001
01:02:37,819 --> 01:02:39,319
And always had to worry about money

1002
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,298
And now thought ... great!

1003
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:44,054
I have more than enough money
to live the next 9 months

1004
01:02:44,592 --> 01:02:45,981
Ok

1005
01:02:46,194 --> 01:02:50,759
And then he enjoyed everything about the
life even be stuck in traffic

1006
01:02:50,999 --> 01:02:54,569
Enjoy watching people and seeing their faces

1007
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:56,003
Only things

1008
01:02:56,004 --> 01:02:58,873
And then what happened?
- What do you mean?

1009
01:02:58,874 --> 01:03:01,142
Well ... still alive?

1010
01:03:01,143 --> 01:03:03,602
No. .. died long ago

1011
01:03:05,682 --> 01:03:11,220
Last night ... I had a dream where he read a book
but it was a lost classic "The Rovers"

1012
01:03:11,221 --> 01:03:15,891
If you like ... loitering, was about young people

1013
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:18,594
Ok ... is a real book?
- No, but it was great

1014
01:03:18,595 --> 01:03:21,463
It was cool, funny,
experimental, had lots of energy

1015
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,333
I love that the books in your dreams

1016
01:03:23,334 --> 01:03:27,170
And always good!
- I have dreams of hero

1017
01:03:27,171 --> 01:03:31,166
As I was flying as
a super hero through walls

1018
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:34,534
And in the end I have an orgasm

1019
01:03:36,747 --> 01:03:39,638
I hope your dreams
come true affection

1020
01:03:54,433 --> 01:04:01,501
Still there

1021
01:04:12,718 --> 01:04:21,049
Still there

1022
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:29,432
He was

1023
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:46,483
I need your card
- Oh I think the room is already paid

1024
01:04:46,521 --> 01:04:49,617
If ...
- If so but the card is for

1025
01:04:50,825 --> 01:04:53,161
For accidents

1026
01:04:53,162 --> 01:04:54,629
Clear

1027
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:56,231
Mr. Wallace
- If?

1028
01:04:56,232 --> 01:04:58,066
I am a huge fan of his books

1029
01:04:58,067 --> 01:05:00,635
My husband gave me his book
on our first date

1030
01:05:00,636 --> 01:05:04,494
Y. .. for a second read
a portion aloud together

1031
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,140
Wow ...
- Could sign it for me?

1032
01:05:06,141 --> 01:05:08,771
Sure! Clear

1033
01:05:09,512 --> 01:05:11,676
I love art work
these issues in Greece

1034
01:05:11,882 --> 01:05:14,984
It's very nice, what is your name?

1035
01:05:14,985 --> 01:05:17,553
For Sophia and Pablus

1036
01:05:17,554 --> 01:05:19,546
Ok ...

1037
01:05:21,157 --> 01:05:25,721
As is the Greek translation?
- Well is ...

1038
01:05:27,698 --> 01:05:29,833
But I'm not sure that is correct

1039
01:05:29,834 --> 01:05:32,429
It's because I never read
in English right? -Exactly

1040
01:05:34,572 --> 01:05:36,306
That is great

1041
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:39,409
Could sign
too? - I? -Yes!

1042
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:42,412
You are the true right?

1043
01:05:42,413 --> 01:05:45,917
Madeleine, not the truth,
people assume that I am

1044
01:05:45,918 --> 01:05:48,809
But not me, he has
a huge imagination

1045
01:05:49,254 --> 01:05:51,322
Would you please do it?

1046
01:05:51,323 --> 01:05:53,384
Mean a lot to my husband

1047
01:05:54,293 --> 01:05:57,321
I can not sign a book I did not write

1048
01:05:57,329 --> 01:05:58,563
I'd be happy to do
- Ok

1049
01:05:58,564 --> 01:06:00,431
Thanks

1050
01:06:00,432 --> 01:06:02,561
I'm happy to do it

1051
01:06:06,739 --> 01:06:09,232
Ok thanks

1052
01:06:11,177 --> 01:06:13,602
Great, thank you very much

1053
01:06:16,749 --> 01:06:20,414
Watch this
- Wow this is cute

1054
01:06:22,156 --> 01:06:24,615
Air Conditioning! Oh I love it!

1055
01:06:27,861 --> 01:06:30,786
Oh wow! There is a tub!

1056
01:06:31,098 --> 01:06:33,666
My God!
- Hey look at this!

1057
01:06:33,667 --> 01:06:36,102
Stefano and Ariadne us
bought a bottle of wine

1058
01:06:36,103 --> 01:06:38,472
And a couple massage

1059
01:06:38,473 --> 01:06:41,075
They are so good, we have to
buy something before we go

1060
01:06:41,076 --> 01:06:43,377
No, no, we should remember
something for the kids too

1061
01:06:43,378 --> 01:06:45,405
If ... I know anyway

1062
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:55,380
I miss girls
- I do not

1063
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:58,393
It's a nice view ...

1064
01:06:58,394 --> 01:07:01,922
The only view in which I am interested

1065
01:07:02,798 --> 01:07:04,265
What?

1066
01:07:04,266 --> 01:07:07,726
This right here

1067
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,707
If ...

1068
01:07:29,059 --> 01:07:30,983
What?

1069
01:07:31,028 --> 01:07:36,833
It's funny never noticed until now
but all the red of your beard is no longer

1070
01:07:37,502 --> 01:07:40,700
It used to be one of the
things that I like you

1071
01:07:48,746 --> 01:07:52,913
Not going to tell me that your love
pigment depends on it?

1072
01:07:53,285 --> 01:07:54,519
No?

1073
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,820
No, but you know ...

1074
01:07:57,289 --> 01:07:59,748
I see that red in our girls

1075
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:03,054
The look and makes me think
to when we met

1076
01:08:07,934 --> 01:08:11,704
You're what I'm looking for

1077
01:08:11,705 --> 01:08:14,539
If after ...

1078
01:08:16,276 --> 01:08:18,735
This weekend

1079
01:08:19,079 --> 01:08:21,606
Without the twins jumping around?

1080
01:08:21,815 --> 01:08:23,512
Exact

1081
01:08:26,787 --> 01:08:29,121
Thinking?

1082
01:08:31,092 --> 01:08:33,926
I like waking up with that sound

1083
01:08:33,961 --> 01:08:36,522
With your eyes open and close

1084
01:08:44,539 --> 01:08:47,908
When you said you could
listen I thought you really think

1085
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:51,408
But they were only my eyelashes
that silly and romantic

1086
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:53,379
That's my favorite

1087
01:08:56,418 --> 01:09:01,449
Strange to think well and
I hate to think in the morning

1088
01:09:11,801 --> 01:09:14,431
I'm anxious now

1089
01:09:16,906 --> 01:09:18,941
Ok ...

1090
01:09:18,942 --> 01:09:21,071
Stop talking for picking

1091
01:09:51,543 --> 01:09:55,778
Henry is ok
- Hey baby are you okay?

1092
01:09:56,348 --> 01:09:58,850
These in London?

1093
01:09:58,851 --> 01:10:00,582
Oh ...

1094
01:10:00,586 --> 01:10:03,318
Ya? Ok

1095
01:10:04,723 --> 01:10:07,659
Oh no, we do not find

1096
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:09,391
I'll send by mail
do not worry about tomorrow

1097
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:14,033
If ...

1098
01:10:14,034 --> 01:10:17,036
Oh, miss you too,
I'll kiss your hand

1099
01:10:17,037 --> 01:10:19,268
If ...

1100
01:10:20,207 --> 01:10:22,374
Ok ... I will tell

1101
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:24,109
Good luck with your mom, if

1102
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:26,137
I love you too, bye

1103
01:10:26,546 --> 01:10:28,538
Ok ...

1104
01:10:30,084 --> 01:10:31,718
OK

1105
01:10:31,719 --> 01:10:33,746
He says he will call you
Chicago when landing

1106
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:36,656
Because I can not talk to
it? I did that twice

1107
01:10:36,657 --> 01:10:39,359
Come on, you could not spend your phone?
You know you want to talk to the

1108
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,695
Well I had no time to talk

1109
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:43,086
What did you say?

1110
01:10:43,087 --> 01:10:45,866
- The science project
send it tomorrow

1111
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:48,702
He'll be fine
- You should not say that about your mom

1112
01:10:48,904 --> 01:10:52,340
What? I said?
- Good luck with your mom

1113
01:10:52,341 --> 01:10:54,876
No. .. I meant no harm

1114
01:10:54,877 --> 01:10:58,579
I know but not good, reminds
everything wrong and would not do that

1115
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:00,114
Oh ... as if you believe that you forget?

1116
01:11:00,115 --> 01:11:03,517
I mean ... acts like it never happened

1117
01:11:03,518 --> 01:11:07,320
Do not put it in your head that goes
if you want to think about it now

1118
01:11:08,424 --> 01:11:11,190
It means nothing?

1119
01:11:11,961 --> 01:11:13,862
Ok even made a joke the other day

1120
01:11:13,863 --> 01:11:17,391
Let your mom and I should
attempt a wrestling show

1121
01:11:18,801 --> 01:11:19,946
You said that?

1122
01:11:19,947 --> 01:11:22,238
- The river has better
your sense of humor

1123
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:23,373
Come on!

1124
01:11:23,374 --> 01:11:28,378
I do not know ... I say we just talked about
So you can not say things in his breast

1125
01:11:28,379 --> 01:11:32,044
Well I said nothing about
his mom made a joke

1126
01:11:33,017 --> 01:11:34,817
What it is

1127
01:11:34,818 --> 01:11:37,209
Only not to contradict all that

1128
01:11:37,655 --> 01:11:40,291
I think this big

1129
01:11:40,292 --> 01:11:42,660
You know how bad it is
all between her mother and I

1130
01:11:42,894 --> 01:11:46,422
Your mom and I ...
- I did nothing it all comes from my

1131
01:11:46,598 --> 01:11:49,796
Ok she hates me, if I caught
her husband a long time ago

1132
01:11:50,201 --> 01:11:52,262
Or should I say he took me to my

1133
01:11:52,437 --> 01:11:54,738
If clear

1134
01:11:54,739 --> 01:11:57,207
Ok do that
his mother and I do not love

1135
01:11:57,208 --> 01:11:59,945
There is the problem is not going to traumatize

1136
01:11:59,946 --> 01:12:01,479
That already happened

1137
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:04,349
Ok? And now try to eat
your fault and say that I am?

1138
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:05,774
No. ..

1139
01:12:05,818 --> 01:12:08,253
Unlike if you could know
make a joke about it

1140
01:12:08,254 --> 01:12:10,519
Maybe you could live better
with it that's what I think

1141
01:12:10,723 --> 01:12:12,090
Ok ...

1142
01:12:12,091 --> 01:12:15,518
You're right, as always
just do not talk about it ok?

1143
01:12:16,496 --> 01:12:20,967
It's not anyone's fault that his mother is
one drunk and psychologically abuse

1144
01:12:20,968 --> 01:12:22,935
Do not say that!

1145
01:12:22,936 --> 01:12:26,772
I mean I have to be sick
with her but judges take

1146
01:12:26,773 --> 01:12:28,541
That women have a maternal instinct

1147
01:12:28,542 --> 01:12:31,342
She has the maternal instinct Madea

1148
01:12:31,578 --> 01:12:33,180
Madea not?

1149
01:12:33,181 --> 01:12:34,982
If ... after all it's a Greek myth

1150
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:36,739
The truth is on Euripides

1151
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:40,253
- A woman who kills her children
to punish her ex-husband

1152
01:12:40,254 --> 01:12:41,388
That is physically making

1153
01:12:41,389 --> 01:12:43,223
This hurting him to get to you

1154
01:12:43,224 --> 01:12:45,692
No, it's making my life
hell through the

1155
01:12:45,693 --> 01:12:50,631
That's what she's doing
but sometimes things go too far

1156
01:12:50,632 --> 01:12:54,763
Ok stop blaming me for everything that
wrong and all this with your wife if?

1157
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,954
Ex wife! For a long time

1158
01:12:57,955 --> 01:13:01,606
- Ok you should put things right for
time but do not hate us so much

1159
01:13:01,641 --> 01:13:04,878
Ok ... ok ... the jodi

1160
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:11,247
Not everything is perfect in our life

1161
01:13:12,489 --> 01:13:14,754
Now put this shit
on me about Henry

1162
01:13:15,325 --> 01:13:17,793
Are you talking about

1163
01:13:17,794 --> 01:13:21,891
Let me talk about moving to
Chicago and give up my life

1164
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,369
Now you mentioned
Henry needs you

1165
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:30,228
How do you think that makes me
feel? I'm miserable right?

1166
01:13:30,374 --> 01:13:34,077
As I can take that
work now? Tell me, tell me

1167
01:13:34,078 --> 01:13:37,781
I feel too guilty
- It's the choice you take seeing him like

1168
01:13:37,782 --> 01:13:39,749
Is that okay?

1169
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:42,652
It is the nature of
be women that helps

1170
01:13:42,653 --> 01:13:43,921
What?

1171
01:13:43,922 --> 01:13:45,990
A nurse

1172
01:13:45,991 --> 01:13:50,861
Ok I can not even say,
I just feel bad about it

1173
01:13:50,862 --> 01:13:53,230
And you look at me like it was my fault
- I look?

1174
01:13:53,231 --> 01:13:56,122
As I forget to put in
his suitcase science project

1175
01:13:56,268 --> 01:13:58,502
I know you blame me
- I said nothing

1176
01:13:58,503 --> 01:14:00,871
No. .. had not said nothing to do

1177
01:14:00,872 --> 01:14:04,640
Yes, always my fault
- Yeah right

1178
01:14:04,844 --> 01:14:08,947
I saw in the fridge at work, your
know with those letters magnetized

1179
01:14:08,948 --> 01:14:11,083
With prayers that make

1180
01:14:11,084 --> 01:14:15,978
Someone had put "women
explored in all eternity "

1181
01:14:16,022 --> 01:14:18,481
In the garden of sacrifice

1182
01:14:21,028 --> 01:14:22,728
That is a sign of God

1183
01:14:22,729 --> 01:14:26,365
If ... this line is so true ...
and it has been for 10,000 years

1184
01:14:26,366 --> 01:14:29,268
But that was not enough
I want to be one of those women

1185
01:14:29,269 --> 01:14:31,704
As marriage is
important for gays

1186
01:14:31,705 --> 01:14:35,808
Or the rights of women is
the same to let my hopes

1187
01:14:35,809 --> 01:14:38,879
With millions of women
I had to do it and not do it

1188
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,475
This is bigger than me
this means more than I

1189
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,556
Bravo nobel committee is taking note

1190
01:14:49,557 --> 01:14:52,826
Wait'll alert Sweden

1191
01:14:52,827 --> 01:14:55,230
I mean ... must be a work of
full-time load as much pressure

1192
01:14:55,331 --> 01:14:56,306
What is

1193
01:14:56,307 --> 01:14:59,734
- You suffered both growing
in a middle class

1194
01:14:59,735 --> 01:15:03,471
The agony of the post-feminist

1195
01:15:03,472 --> 01:15:06,708
I can not imagine
- You're an idiot

1196
01:15:06,709 --> 01:15:09,475
You know what honey? When
We're moving to Chicago?

1197
01:15:09,812 --> 01:15:14,513
I want to make sure I could find
a nice house and can do everything

1198
01:15:14,651 --> 01:15:16,819
Y choose bed covers

1199
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:20,456
So this is how you spend the night?

1200
01:15:20,457 --> 01:15:23,292
This is what I want to do tonight?
- You started

1201
01:15:23,293 --> 01:15:27,396
You're the one who never shuts up about
this, but if you want to talk about it

1202
01:15:27,397 --> 01:15:33,293
I mean seriously talk rather have
emotionless rational conversation

1203
01:15:33,404 --> 01:15:35,438
Think we can say
do that? Would it be possible?

1204
01:15:35,439 --> 01:15:38,074
Here we go
- Without being emotional and rational

1205
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:41,444
Always do the
the one that is rational

1206
01:15:41,445 --> 01:15:45,048
And I'm the irrational, hysterical

1207
01:15:45,049 --> 01:15:49,511
Because I have emotions speak
from your big prospect

1208
01:15:49,655 --> 01:15:52,023
This means that all
what you say is true

1209
01:15:52,024 --> 01:15:54,225
Always I'll do anything
- The world is fucked

1210
01:15:54,226 --> 01:15:56,890
For irrational crap
deciding sucks

1211
01:15:57,296 --> 01:16:00,064
Is that okay?
- Politicians offer a reason

1212
01:16:00,065 --> 01:16:02,524
The corporate heads decide
destroy the environment

1213
01:16:02,734 --> 01:16:05,804
Channey, Roosevelt, very rational men

1214
01:16:05,805 --> 01:16:08,807
If ok
- If you know a solution

1215
01:16:08,808 --> 01:16:11,476
Very rational

1216
01:16:11,477 --> 01:16:14,313
Ok so we against the final solution

1217
01:16:14,314 --> 01:16:18,115
Ok ... let's do it right? Let me ask you this

1218
01:16:18,318 --> 01:16:22,788
Think Henry's life would
better for a more consistent

1219
01:16:22,789 --> 01:16:24,357
From his father

1220
01:16:24,358 --> 01:16:25,570
Here we go

1221
01:16:25,571 --> 01:16:27,994
- I do not want to leave there
so if you talk about it?

1222
01:16:27,995 --> 01:16:30,158
Just let me ask you a question

1223
01:16:30,864 --> 01:16:33,180
Think in the next
Life would be better with

1224
01:16:33,181 --> 01:16:35,496
A consistent presence of you and me?

1225
01:16:35,502 --> 01:16:39,305
Yes! I think it would be better
if he lived with us

1226
01:16:39,306 --> 01:16:41,041
And I think her mom is a
damn alcoholic motherfucker

1227
01:16:41,042 --> 01:16:43,911
I use the time we were
in Paris and I was giving birth

1228
01:16:43,912 --> 01:16:47,372
And almost dying to get
Henry legally New York

1229
01:16:47,549 --> 01:16:51,783
To hell with it
- Ok I agree with you

1230
01:16:51,987 --> 01:16:55,589
Ok, unfortunately
we can get him out of America

1231
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:58,225
But we could if we wanted to go where the

1232
01:16:58,226 --> 01:17:00,662
Now I know that would be a big move

1233
01:17:00,663 --> 01:17:04,566
But you think? There are so
you can be happy in America?

1234
01:17:04,567 --> 01:17:07,265
Or just out of range of possibility?

1235
01:17:07,403 --> 01:17:09,862
I mean you could find
comparable work there?

1236
01:17:09,872 --> 01:17:12,374
Comparable? Are you kidding?
- No!

1237
01:17:12,375 --> 01:17:15,903
Because I'm the one with
to make compromises?

1238
01:17:15,911 --> 01:17:17,904
I mean ...
- It's so dramatic ok?

1239
01:17:18,315 --> 01:17:21,350
Good move to Chicago is dramatic

1240
01:17:21,351 --> 01:17:25,788
I'm not saying we should move
I just want to talk about it

1241
01:17:25,789 --> 01:17:27,857
You can be my friend for 2
seconds so we can talk?

1242
01:17:27,858 --> 01:17:29,555
Ok 2 seconds
- Okay

1243
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:32,228
Remember that day you arrived 35 minutes
late to pick up the girls from school

1244
01:17:32,229 --> 01:17:36,700
And you were so stressed knowing
who were there at the games

1245
01:17:36,701 --> 01:17:40,935
Wondering what happened to you? Ok well
is how I feel all the time

1246
01:17:41,105 --> 01:17:45,339
You know, jodi, it leaves behind
and want to be more with the

1247
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:47,978
You're always like that when you leave

1248
01:17:47,979 --> 01:17:50,747
These sad and you start to fight

1249
01:17:50,748 --> 01:17:55,415
He's good, is a great guy ok?

1250
01:17:55,654 --> 01:17:58,522
But the truth is that you do not
needs as it used to need you

1251
01:17:58,824 --> 01:18:02,387
You missed the opportunity
to be with him in his childhood

1252
01:18:03,028 --> 01:18:06,989
And you mourn over
but it is growing

1253
01:18:07,132 --> 01:18:12,271
You're a great father other
ok these divorced ways other

1254
01:18:12,272 --> 01:18:19,339
Ideal? No, listen if a
month even want to leave my job

1255
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:22,381
And leave everything you've been
working all these years

1256
01:18:22,382 --> 01:18:26,582
Just ask me but now I
I feel like I have always felt

1257
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:31,221
I would move back to the United States if
that wife of yours gives custody

1258
01:18:31,492 --> 01:18:34,019
To see Jessy

1259
01:18:34,028 --> 01:18:36,229
Less than 30 days per semester

1260
01:18:36,230 --> 01:18:39,394
And if you think it is worth to
we change our lives

1261
01:18:39,934 --> 01:18:43,002
Only by that time
- I know you're right

1262
01:18:43,003 --> 01:18:46,771
See? I'm being rational

1263
01:18:47,342 --> 01:18:51,312
It's just ... a bad
position he did nothing

1264
01:18:51,313 --> 01:18:53,578
But he is the one who has to pay all

1265
01:18:54,082 --> 01:18:56,177
Now we have him in our lives ms

1266
01:18:56,485 --> 01:18:58,653
If it were not for my your marriage
was over something else

1267
01:18:59,654 --> 01:19:00,737
Absolutely

1268
01:19:00,738 --> 01:19:03,987
- Or worse have been raised
two miserable parents

1269
01:19:04,127 --> 01:19:05,994
Sure ...

1270
01:19:06,829 --> 01:19:08,594
It is a joke

1271
01:19:11,601 --> 01:19:14,060
You mean you fucked to
move to Paris to be with me?

1272
01:19:14,871 --> 01:19:16,838
NO ... not what I meant

1273
01:19:16,839 --> 01:19:20,075
Stop! You know that's not what I meant

1274
01:19:20,076 --> 01:19:22,111
I told you not to do ok?
- Stop it!

1275
01:19:22,112 --> 01:19:26,949
Ok ... I moved to New York
you for two years and leave everything

1276
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:29,218
But I needed to be home
to give birth to the twins

1277
01:19:29,219 --> 01:19:33,487
Because it was something complicated and wanted to be
with my mother and also wanted that

1278
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:36,192
If
- That's all I ask

1279
01:19:36,193 --> 01:19:39,893
The only thing ... and now I
blame you forever?

1280
01:19:40,098 --> 01:19:42,299
Stop please

1281
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,826
Stop

1282
01:19:43,968 --> 01:19:48,964
If you do not want to move to USA
we will not end of story

1283
01:19:49,274 --> 01:19:53,477
Is that okay? Just trying to find a
way where I can be more consistent

1284
01:19:53,478 --> 01:19:57,337
In this life and ideally
I would like to do as a family

1285
01:19:58,150 --> 01:20:00,752
As a family or what?

1286
01:20:00,753 --> 01:20:02,882
What the fuck does that mean?

1287
01:20:03,322 --> 01:20:07,623
I feel a threat Passive-aggressive
in everything you say,

1288
01:20:07,624 --> 01:20:11,925
I do this or I resentiré
the rest of our lives

1289
01:20:14,968 --> 01:20:17,302
I have reason?

1290
01:20:17,871 --> 01:20:22,870
You know what? I'm feeling
something ... I think the problem

1291
01:20:22,871 --> 01:20:26,269
I just do not want
who has a better job

1292
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:30,282
On some level you feel
I threatened to accomplish something

1293
01:20:30,283 --> 01:20:32,549
That would minimize your
been in this relationship

1294
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:35,689
My state? In our relationship?

1295
01:20:35,690 --> 01:20:37,624
I teach two courses per semester

1296
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:39,893
In an American school damn ok?

1297
01:20:39,894 --> 01:20:43,196
That ... this is a great status

1298
01:20:43,197 --> 01:20:47,267
I do not think it's a coincidence that
feel that we are at the same time

1299
01:20:47,268 --> 01:20:48,602
And that I have a chance
exciting work

1300
01:20:48,603 --> 01:20:52,640
All this is complete shit and you know it

1301
01:20:52,641 --> 01:20:57,612
I have a question for you
- If we had the girls

1302
01:20:57,613 --> 01:21:00,982
Still be together?

1303
01:21:00,983 --> 01:21:02,583
What?

1304
01:21:02,584 --> 01:21:05,052
You're the mayor of villa-Madness

1305
01:21:05,053 --> 01:21:08,624
You know? What are
- I think you have to move to Chicago

1306
01:21:08,625 --> 01:21:10,659
I think Henry needs you
and I have to stay

1307
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:12,694
In Paris with the girls and take the job

1308
01:21:12,695 --> 01:21:18,834
Why are you doing this? That's a ridiculous idea,
I will miss you and the girls? Not

1309
01:21:18,835 --> 01:21:22,271
Because you make everything so difficult?
- You're unhappy with me

1310
01:21:22,272 --> 01:21:24,641
You blame me for your son away from

1311
01:21:24,642 --> 01:21:29,570
That is irrational
something I try to do

1312
01:21:30,681 --> 01:21:33,116
Listen Jessy

1313
01:21:33,117 --> 01:21:38,113
We just spent the last
6 weeks here and it was great

1314
01:21:38,989 --> 01:21:43,861
You could write all
days and the weather has been good

1315
01:21:43,862 --> 01:21:47,064
But I wanted to come to Greece
- What is

1316
01:21:47,065 --> 01:21:51,802
It could be a revolution
at any time

1317
01:21:51,803 --> 01:21:53,737
People can do something

1318
01:21:53,738 --> 01:21:57,741
And act all happy but not
talk about how annoying they are

1319
01:21:57,742 --> 01:22:00,111
And I'm confused and do not know what will happen

1320
01:22:00,112 --> 01:22:06,017
Let me tell you what will happen,
the same thing always happens

1321
01:22:06,018 --> 01:22:07,680
Nothing

1322
01:22:08,688 --> 01:22:11,790
Okay, you know what? I have had
zero time for myself

1323
01:22:11,791 --> 01:22:15,360
I have 10 000 E-mails
I have not answered answer

1324
01:22:15,361 --> 01:22:18,331
Think I do not?
- Spend all day making dinner

1325
01:22:18,332 --> 01:22:22,190
And while you and your
Friends urinate outside the toilet

1326
01:22:23,904 --> 01:22:29,041
You are a genius! Oh blah
blah no! You are a genius!

1327
01:22:29,042 --> 01:22:30,910
And the second we said goodbye to Henry

1328
01:22:30,911 --> 01:22:32,778
suggest that perhaps
should quit my job

1329
01:22:32,779 --> 01:22:34,080
Because you feel bad?

1330
01:22:34,081 --> 01:22:35,779
Now is your dream job

1331
01:22:35,783 --> 01:22:37,818
This afternoon you were
sure I wanted to do that

1332
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:40,954
But now it's your job
dream you ever listen?

1333
01:22:40,955 --> 01:22:45,258
Yes, it's my dream job just because
I have doubts does not mean that I want

1334
01:22:45,259 --> 01:22:48,161
Ok ...
- But why do you care?

1335
01:22:48,162 --> 01:22:50,723
Every day you go around with your
walk under the trees oil

1336
01:22:51,065 --> 01:22:53,901
Oh Socrates should get a rope

1337
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:57,772
It's an hour my walk
- For when you leave and when you return

1338
01:22:57,773 --> 01:23:02,243
Two hours, he could do
that, you are very good taking care

1339
01:23:02,244 --> 01:23:04,379
I take care of myself and everything else

1340
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:07,548
If we go somewhere you pack up
your suitcase and I do everything else

1341
01:23:07,549 --> 01:23:10,218
Never let me pack
things girls

1342
01:23:10,219 --> 01:23:11,409
Never!

1343
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:13,789
- Why not have shoes
and lots of underwear

1344
01:23:13,790 --> 01:23:15,413
Ok well you say that your

1345
01:23:15,414 --> 01:23:18,661
- I am happy that you
contemplate the universe

1346
01:23:18,662 --> 01:23:22,164
And all existential problems
because I do not, I have hardly time to think

1347
01:23:22,165 --> 01:23:24,533
Labor'm babysitting job, I'm babysitting

1348
01:23:24,534 --> 01:23:27,630
Wait a second, I have to do something

1349
01:23:28,471 --> 01:23:32,942
You know what? The only time I can think
is when I'm in the bathroom at the office

1350
01:23:32,943 --> 01:23:35,834
Begin to associate the
thought with the smell of shit

1351
01:23:36,447 --> 01:23:39,349
That's a good thing

1352
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:40,617
You should put that in a book someday

1353
01:23:40,618 --> 01:23:43,509
Yes, I'm sure you will
and will be the best line of the book

1354
01:23:43,821 --> 01:23:47,558
And of course you can never
use me or what I say

1355
01:23:47,559 --> 01:23:51,622
In one of your damn books
again and that goes for girls too

1356
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:52,663
Ok

1357
01:23:52,664 --> 01:23:54,398
You should not mess with a writer

1358
01:23:54,399 --> 01:23:57,201
You were not in the last book or
in which I am writing now

1359
01:23:57,202 --> 01:23:59,467
And finally, write about what you want

1360
01:24:00,439 --> 01:24:02,239
As always, we serve

1361
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:05,277
Do not give me that shit

1362
01:24:05,278 --> 01:24:09,381
We're not in the 50s sorry
for ruining your perfect narrative

1363
01:24:09,382 --> 01:24:14,986
With the truth but I'm the one in
home every day dealing with the shit

1364
01:24:14,987 --> 01:24:16,722
Why are you at work
to the 6:30 to 6:00

1365
01:24:16,723 --> 01:24:21,293
Take the girls to school and I
pick them up and that's just our deal

1366
01:24:21,294 --> 01:24:25,031
We live in Paris France

1367
01:24:25,032 --> 01:24:27,567
If and I remember every day

1368
01:24:27,568 --> 01:24:30,970
I have made my life around you and you know

1369
01:24:30,971 --> 01:24:34,607
Ok? So sorry if
these are not holidays

1370
01:24:34,608 --> 01:24:38,411
For all that I see
do is eat Greek salad

1371
01:24:38,412 --> 01:24:42,483
Ok? But you should not spend your
life in some kind of torture

1372
01:24:42,484 --> 01:24:45,876
You know what? What I love about the
is men who still believe in magic

1373
01:24:46,154 --> 01:24:49,356
The little fairy collect stockings

1374
01:24:49,357 --> 01:24:51,525
The fairies who take the
dishwasher dishes

1375
01:24:51,526 --> 01:24:53,227
Hadas blocker that put children

1376
01:24:53,228 --> 01:24:56,630
Little fairies making salad
Greek eat like a pig

1377
01:24:56,631 --> 01:25:00,301
Ok listen if? You're great taking care

1378
01:25:00,302 --> 01:25:01,803
What are

1379
01:25:01,804 --> 01:25:06,941
I mean ... look after the children you care
your friends, take care to the world

1380
01:25:06,942 --> 01:25:11,546
Were you this before you were
breast and now is only magnified

1381
01:25:11,547 --> 01:25:16,152
But ... I've been saying this
for years have to do a better

1382
01:25:16,153 --> 01:25:18,587
Job taking care of yourself

1383
01:25:18,588 --> 01:25:19,822
Ok stop

1384
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:23,626
I am the one at home
every day at 6:30

1385
01:25:23,627 --> 01:25:27,463
I am reliable, have you ever
made an appointment with the nanny before?

1386
01:25:28,064 --> 01:25:31,066
No, what is the name of your doctor?

1387
01:25:31,067 --> 01:25:33,537
Stop asking me questions is boring

1388
01:25:33,538 --> 01:25:38,542
If .. Ok ... know what? I'm home
every night, I made dinner, give baths

1389
01:25:38,543 --> 01:25:43,013
And I read bedtime stories sometimes these
there or sometimes in a college event

1390
01:25:43,014 --> 01:25:44,815
Or a publicity tour

1391
01:25:44,816 --> 01:25:48,318
Ok? When you are inspired
keep writing

1392
01:25:48,319 --> 01:25:50,888
I sometimes am inspired

1393
01:25:50,889 --> 01:25:53,357
Want to write? Ok do

1394
01:25:53,358 --> 01:25:57,428
No, but remember we used to sing
and play guitar and play songs

1395
01:25:57,429 --> 01:26:00,998
Even I'd do it but I have no time

1396
01:26:00,999 --> 01:26:04,836
Ok ... well first of all
I do not write as a hobby

1397
01:26:04,837 --> 01:26:07,655
Second, I wish
find the time ... of

1398
01:26:07,656 --> 01:26:10,475
Somehow find
time to complain

1399
01:26:10,476 --> 01:26:15,097
And I say ... I love the way you sing ok?

1400
01:26:15,098 --> 01:26:19,718
Jodi my life by the way you sing

1401
01:26:19,719 --> 01:26:26,359
Ok? If you took an eighth of the
energy you spend complaining, crying

1402
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:29,796
And worrying, if you put
that energy into something good

1403
01:26:29,797 --> 01:26:32,392
I mean serious Django

1404
01:26:37,304 --> 01:26:39,763
Ok

1405
01:26:40,407 --> 01:26:44,039
Forgot your shoes

1406
01:27:02,131 --> 01:27:05,233
You think you're winning?

1407
01:27:05,234 --> 01:27:10,305
Very few people know what it is for
active and passionate woman to have a child

1408
01:27:10,306 --> 01:27:13,308
Some friends tell me that
would jump out the window

1409
01:27:13,309 --> 01:27:16,211
Ok? But the truth is that you never
I wanted to hurt them even once

1410
01:27:16,212 --> 01:27:18,910
But I thought about killing myself over 100 times

1411
01:27:19,449 --> 01:27:23,085
I was so confused that always
were in a stupid book tour

1412
01:27:23,086 --> 01:27:26,751
Holy shit custody
Henry and do not want to burden

1413
01:27:31,461 --> 01:27:34,063
Do not play with words!

1414
01:27:34,064 --> 01:27:38,335
It's the same, you know how many times I
been alone with the girls crying?

1415
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:42,005
Not knowing what to do? You know the guilt that
a mother feels when you do not know what to do?

1416
01:27:42,006 --> 01:27:44,931
Think you're still owns that feeling?

1417
01:27:45,843 --> 01:27:48,845
Do not think you understand ok?

1418
01:27:48,846 --> 01:27:51,776
You know what? My fear
secret with men is

1419
01:27:51,777 --> 01:27:54,708
We all want me
submissive housewife

1420
01:27:55,387 --> 01:28:00,124
Ok ... no one could ever do that

1421
01:28:00,125 --> 01:28:03,995
I promise it would be easier
fit your head to a toaster

1422
01:28:03,996 --> 01:28:06,660
They become submissive

1423
01:28:10,336 --> 01:28:14,506
When the girls were born did not know that
do people expect women

1424
01:28:14,507 --> 01:28:18,900
Let us have an instinct that appears

1425
01:28:19,212 --> 01:28:22,240
But I had no idea how to do things

1426
01:28:22,582 --> 01:28:26,418
I love them so much and was doing it all wrong

1427
01:28:26,786 --> 01:28:31,283
And you were away so often and always
asked me how was my day

1428
01:28:31,492 --> 01:28:35,862
I could not even tell you because
I was so ashamed of not knowing what to do

1429
01:28:35,863 --> 01:28:38,631
Look I think you did well
- No of course not

1430
01:28:38,632 --> 01:28:41,091
Sure, well, at least you did
one great job faking it right

1431
01:28:44,038 --> 01:28:47,173
I remember that the only way
to make you sleep

1432
01:28:47,174 --> 01:28:51,645
It was that stupid car pulling the
stairs and walk with them for hours

1433
01:28:51,646 --> 01:28:54,480
In the middle of the night

1434
01:28:55,017 --> 01:28:58,686
Almost once stole the only
why not the guy attacked me

1435
01:28:58,687 --> 01:29:04,616
It was because I was so pathetic the only
good to have more than 35 is that you do not violate

1436
01:29:05,828 --> 01:29:09,959
I read it, it's true
- Oh Jesus

1437
01:29:12,135 --> 01:29:17,005
One time I remember that
I was watching the twins

1438
01:29:17,006 --> 01:29:21,576
And they looked so cute and was
happy because they were happy

1439
01:29:21,577 --> 01:29:27,507
And one of them had ... one Hulla-Hulla
I was using as jump rope

1440
01:29:28,052 --> 01:29:32,013
But then the other wanted it so
they began to fight for it

1441
01:29:32,589 --> 01:29:34,791
And out of nowhere saw it all

1442
01:29:34,792 --> 01:29:39,128
All jealousy and selfishness

1443
01:29:39,129 --> 01:29:46,170
And I remember thinking ... this
is the natural state of man

1444
01:29:46,171 --> 01:29:50,837
Always a little dissatisfied and discontent

1445
01:29:51,776 --> 01:29:53,643
I mean ...

1446
01:29:53,778 --> 01:29:55,179
Look at us

1447
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:59,217
Here we are, we are
in ... the Garden of Eden

1448
01:29:59,218 --> 01:30:01,745
And we can not stop fighting

1449
01:30:02,088 --> 01:30:06,291
I do not think there is a human state
natural human state is multiple

1450
01:30:06,292 --> 01:30:10,161
I mean, if that's what you see
when you see your daughter playing

1451
01:30:10,162 --> 01:30:13,031
It means that these depressed

1452
01:30:13,032 --> 01:30:14,956
Ok ...

1453
01:30:14,967 --> 01:30:19,038
Perhaps this
- When I see them I see beautiful energy fight

1454
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:23,068
Moving forward in life while
that no one would take what they have

1455
01:30:23,443 --> 01:30:26,912
I like when they fight gives me hope

1456
01:30:26,913 --> 01:30:29,110
Well it is because they have
conflicting emotions know

1457
01:30:29,116 --> 01:30:33,077
Only end up hurting you

1458
01:30:35,690 --> 01:30:36,934
And never bother?

1459
01:30:36,935 --> 01:30:39,423
- When not bother
I see it as a positive

1460
01:30:42,130 --> 01:30:44,361
You know something?

1461
01:30:46,434 --> 01:30:48,869
The way you write on
your books people approach me

1462
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:52,399
And I believe that love
a kind of Henry Miller

1463
01:30:54,676 --> 01:30:59,547
You like to have sex just as often

1464
01:30:59,548 --> 01:31:03,017
When you have it you have it
- Kiss, kiss, boob, tit

1465
01:31:03,018 --> 01:31:05,720
Vagina ...

1466
01:31:05,721 --> 01:31:09,458
I am a man of simple pleasures

1467
01:31:09,459 --> 01:31:10,959
If simple

1468
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:15,564
And I wanted to say that lately
're no Henry Miller

1469
01:31:15,565 --> 01:31:19,196
At any level

1470
01:31:19,536 --> 01:31:26,102
You know what? This place makes me uncomfortable
expected something like the real Greece

1471
01:31:26,309 --> 01:31:29,379
This place is real
- What we do here the same?

1472
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:31,281
It is supposed to have a great night

1473
01:31:31,282 --> 01:31:35,083
You know ... no place
to be spontaneous

1474
01:31:35,286 --> 01:31:37,520
And this is stupid and does not work

1475
01:31:37,521 --> 01:31:39,088
Ok ... obviously

1476
01:31:39,089 --> 01:31:41,821
And Stefano curse for doing this

1477
01:31:42,092 --> 01:31:46,197
Ok a couples massage?! That
fuck is that!? Insurance sucks

1478
01:31:46,198 --> 01:31:48,763
No, you do ok?

1479
01:31:49,164 --> 01:31:53,094
Let this place is not so bad
I like hotel rooms

1480
01:31:53,772 --> 01:31:57,505
I think they are sexy
- If I know that if

1481
01:31:58,710 --> 01:32:00,236
Lord's book tour

1482
01:32:02,547 --> 01:32:04,575
Lord Radisson Hilton

1483
01:32:06,185 --> 01:32:10,385
And that time when you were in Washington

1484
01:32:10,423 --> 01:32:14,816
When your phone broke
that night, which suitable

1485
01:32:15,861 --> 01:32:18,991
Jura for our daughters who do not
fucked the woman in the shop

1486
01:32:19,098 --> 01:32:20,566
Emily

1487
01:32:20,567 --> 01:32:25,671
Swear that you fucked
Emily and I'm jealous

1488
01:32:25,672 --> 01:32:29,269
But I just want to know is
a man and admits the truth

1489
01:32:30,711 --> 01:32:36,845
I give my life ok? Not
I have nothing more to give

1490
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:43,319
Do not give it to anyone else if
looking for permission to disqualify

1491
01:32:43,858 --> 01:32:46,093
Do not give it

1492
01:32:46,094 --> 01:32:49,229
Ok? I I love you

1493
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:55,202
Ok? And I am not in conflict
but if what you want

1494
01:32:55,203 --> 01:32:59,274
They make a list of everything
you bother me I can do it

1495
01:32:59,275 --> 01:33:01,743
If ... I want to know

1496
01:33:01,744 --> 01:33:02,810
Ok good

1497
01:33:02,811 --> 01:33:04,479
Let's start one

1498
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:06,814
One .. 're crazy

1499
01:33:07,116 --> 01:33:11,119
Ok? Good luck finding
anyone else who wants to hold your ...

1500
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:15,958
Your shit more than six months but
I accept the whole package

1501
01:33:15,959 --> 01:33:20,529
The bright crazy and know you will not
to change and you do not want

1502
01:33:20,530 --> 01:33:22,998
Called accept you for being you

1503
01:33:22,999 --> 01:33:27,536
Ok I asked you a question, if when
was with the double stroller down the street

1504
01:33:27,537 --> 01:33:31,574
You fucked this girl Emily?

1505
01:33:31,575 --> 01:33:34,911
Ok ... I do not know that Emily talk

1506
01:33:34,912 --> 01:33:37,747
The one I wrote these
E-mails about Dostoevsky

1507
01:33:37,748 --> 01:33:43,153
Jessy Oh you're so right the great
commander is the deepest passage

1508
01:33:43,154 --> 01:33:44,954
Of all the literary revolution

1509
01:33:44,955 --> 01:33:49,493
If you ask me if I'm
committed to you, with girls

1510
01:33:49,494 --> 01:33:54,388
And the life we ??build
together, the answer is a Yes

1511
01:33:54,766 --> 01:33:57,781
Then you fuck her thank you very much

1512
01:33:57,782 --> 01:34:00,838
- Ever wonder
when you went to visit

1513
01:34:00,839 --> 01:34:04,508
To your old boyfriend after
his mother died? No, you know why?

1514
01:34:04,509 --> 01:34:07,346
Because I know how to work your butt French

1515
01:34:07,347 --> 01:34:09,514
And I guarantee that at least you did something

1516
01:34:09,515 --> 01:34:14,286
But I also know that you love me and I'm
well you're a complicated human being

1517
01:34:14,287 --> 01:34:19,291
I do not want to live a boring life where
two people own each other

1518
01:34:19,292 --> 01:34:22,894
Where two people are institutionalized
in a box that others create

1519
01:34:22,895 --> 01:34:26,197
Because that's a load of crap!

1520
01:34:43,618 --> 01:34:46,987
Know what happens here?

1521
01:34:46,988 --> 01:34:48,821
Is simple

1522
01:34:50,225 --> 01:34:53,594
Do not think you still love

1523
01:36:07,406 --> 01:36:10,876
I do not want to talk now
- This here alone? Waiting for someone?

1524
01:36:10,877 --> 01:36:14,379
If ... I'm single and happy
pregnant'm an annoying person

1525
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:16,247
And I hurt my children to my
work and to all who love

1526
01:36:19,419 --> 01:36:22,221
Ok ... not in the mood came to be alone

1527
01:36:22,222 --> 01:36:25,023
Listen I've been watching
from the other side of the coffee

1528
01:36:25,024 --> 01:36:27,593
And I want to make you Uncomfortable

1529
01:36:27,594 --> 01:36:30,486
But you're the best in this place
- Thanks

1530
01:36:30,498 --> 01:36:33,890
Yes, would love to buy a
drink or maybe meet

1531
01:36:34,435 --> 01:36:37,463
You know, you're here for business

1532
01:36:38,072 --> 01:36:41,441
Have a boyfriend

1533
01:36:41,442 --> 01:36:42,742
No more

1534
01:36:42,743 --> 01:36:45,839
I'm sorry to hear that,
God want to talk about that?

1535
01:36:46,046 --> 01:36:49,382
Do not talk to strangers
- Well I'm not a stranger

1536
01:36:49,417 --> 01:36:53,844
We have known
before, in the summer of 94

1537
01:36:56,892 --> 01:36:58,292
You're confusing me with someone else

1538
01:36:58,293 --> 01:36:59,593
Not

1539
01:36:59,594 --> 01:37:04,159
Even we fell
- Really?

1540
01:37:04,367 --> 01:37:07,167
Vaguely remember
someone sweet and romantic

1541
01:37:08,204 --> 01:37:09,971
That made me feel that she was not alone

1542
01:37:09,972 --> 01:37:12,340
Someone who was respected

1543
01:37:12,475 --> 01:37:14,242
That's me

1544
01:37:14,243 --> 01:37:17,779
I'm that guy
- I do not think

1545
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:21,984
See? It is something you do not know

1546
01:37:21,985 --> 01:37:25,252
Really? That thing?
- An important

1547
01:37:26,423 --> 01:37:31,192
Yes, I know because I've been through this

1548
01:37:31,628 --> 01:37:32,795
How?

1549
01:37:32,796 --> 01:37:34,561
Let me tell you

1550
01:37:35,332 --> 01:37:36,933
Ok ...

1551
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:39,302
I have a room there at the hotel

1552
01:37:39,571 --> 01:37:41,872
I've come to save you

1553
01:37:41,873 --> 01:37:45,642
Save me from what?
- Save you from all the shit

1554
01:37:45,643 --> 01:37:51,379
It sucks
- I assure you that guy you remember

1555
01:37:54,152 --> 01:37:56,386
That's me

1556
01:37:56,387 --> 01:37:58,189
Are you?
- If

1557
01:37:58,190 --> 01:38:01,354
I did not recognize

1558
01:38:01,527 --> 01:38:04,896
You look like shit

1559
01:38:04,930 --> 01:38:08,163
Well I can say it is difficult
there with the time and space

1560
01:38:08,467 --> 01:38:14,328
Your ... on the other hand are
more beautiful than I remember

1561
01:38:15,208 --> 01:38:16,642
Lie

1562
01:38:16,643 --> 01:38:20,579
Jessy is not a game, you get all cute

1563
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:23,210
The following will you buy
peanut butter in Chicago

1564
01:38:23,650 --> 01:38:25,950
You will not do better with a Line

1565
01:38:26,119 --> 01:38:29,521
Do not try to do anything
these misunderstanding me

1566
01:38:29,522 --> 01:38:31,856
No, no ... I'm just here as a messenger

1567
01:38:32,025 --> 01:38:39,389
I just traveled from the future,
I was with you at age 82

1568
01:38:39,967 --> 01:38:44,201
That gave me a letter to read you

1569
01:38:44,238 --> 01:38:47,107
So here I am
- I'm still alive at 80?

1570
01:38:47,108 --> 01:38:49,567
Oh yeah

1571
01:38:50,144 --> 01:38:54,081
How's my ass?
- Cute

1572
01:38:54,082 --> 01:38:58,509
I do not care how I look
- Say it is better

1573
01:38:58,553 --> 01:39:00,354
Ok great

1574
01:39:00,355 --> 01:39:02,490
Want me to read?
- I have a choice?

1575
01:39:02,491 --> 01:39:06,588
Sure if you're not interested in ...
- No, not clear if

1576
01:39:08,898 --> 01:39:14,403
I write Dear Celine
across the forest

1577
01:39:14,404 --> 01:39:17,139
This letter is lighting a candle

1578
01:39:17,140 --> 01:39:21,810
Stop this never write another
side of the forest? That forest talk

1579
01:39:21,811 --> 01:39:23,445
I can continue?

1580
01:39:23,446 --> 01:39:24,579
Ok ...

1581
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:27,417
I send you this young

1582
01:39:27,418 --> 01:39:29,385
If ... young

1583
01:39:29,386 --> 01:39:32,221
And it will be your companion

1584
01:39:32,222 --> 01:39:37,760
God knows I have many problems
and fought all his life logging

1585
01:39:37,761 --> 01:39:40,994
And being present with those he loves

1586
01:39:42,299 --> 01:39:45,100
And so so sorry

1587
01:39:46,171 --> 01:39:48,334
But you are his only hope

1588
01:39:49,941 --> 01:39:51,642
Celine

1589
01:39:51,643 --> 01:39:54,375
My advice is this

1590
01:39:54,512 --> 01:39:58,582
Those entering the
best years of your life

1591
01:39:58,583 --> 01:40:04,522
Looking back from what I said now
these years are sometimes more difficult

1592
01:40:04,523 --> 01:40:09,094
And when were 12 Mathew and Vanessa

1593
01:40:09,095 --> 01:40:13,295
They danced all night with the
song "How deep is your love"

1594
01:40:13,666 --> 01:40:14,966
Do not know

1595
01:40:14,967 --> 01:40:20,606
Anyway .. Celine will be fine, your
girls grow up to be examples

1596
01:40:20,607 --> 01:40:23,407
E icons of feminism
- Good

1597
01:40:23,410 --> 01:40:27,747
Yeah well you know I just
to notice there is something below

1598
01:40:27,748 --> 01:40:30,616
Maybe I should move to end

1599
01:40:30,617 --> 01:40:31,751
If the end head over

1600
01:40:31,752 --> 01:40:33,676
Ok ... sure?
- Yes!

1601
01:40:34,221 --> 01:40:36,384
Well ...

1602
01:40:36,724 --> 01:40:38,614
Ok ... if

1603
01:40:41,896 --> 01:40:48,166
Ok .. Here, postscript, by the way

1604
01:40:48,736 --> 01:40:54,007
Certainly the best sex
of my life happened one night

1605
01:40:54,008 --> 01:40:56,877
In South Palepanise

1606
01:40:57,279 --> 01:40:59,914
Do not miss

1607
01:40:59,915 --> 01:41:04,342
My sexual being was to a new level

1608
01:41:05,420 --> 01:41:07,811
Brilliant

1609
01:41:08,524 --> 01:41:13,385
Look Jessy can leave this stupid
game? We are not in one of your stories

1610
01:41:13,563 --> 01:41:14,759
Ok?

1611
01:41:15,498 --> 01:41:19,698
Hear what I said? Hear?

1612
01:41:20,136 --> 01:41:21,670
If ...

1613
01:41:21,671 --> 01:41:23,939
I hear you

1614
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:25,830
They no longer want to be with me anymore?

1615
01:41:27,110 --> 01:41:30,344
I thought you did not want to say
seriously but if so

1616
01:41:30,514 --> 01:41:36,052
Fuck it, you're like
girls and other

1617
01:41:36,053 --> 01:41:37,750
Want to live in a fairy

1618
01:41:37,855 --> 01:41:40,456
Just trying to improve things here

1619
01:41:40,457 --> 01:41:43,726
I told you I love you unconditionally
I told you you're beautiful

1620
01:41:43,727 --> 01:41:46,595
I tell you your butt looks great

1621
01:41:48,066 --> 01:41:51,402
I try to make you laugh
- Ok

1622
01:41:51,403 --> 01:41:57,241
Hold a lot of your shit and if you think
I'm a dog that always return

1623
01:41:57,242 --> 01:42:03,308
Then you're wrong but if
want true love then now is

1624
01:42:03,682 --> 01:42:06,651
Real life is not perfect

1625
01:42:06,652 --> 01:42:09,054
If you can not see it then you are blind

1626
01:42:09,055 --> 01:42:11,423
I give up

1627
01:42:47,629 --> 01:42:51,521
What about this time machine?

1628
01:42:54,435 --> 01:42:56,700
What do you mean?

1629
01:42:56,771 --> 01:42:59,367
How does it work?

1630
01:43:00,276 --> 01:43:02,906
It's complicated

1631
01:43:06,348 --> 01:43:09,512
Will I have to undress to operate it?

1632
01:43:11,954 --> 01:43:16,825
I mean ...
- Yes, if it is a problem

1633
01:43:16,826 --> 01:43:21,458
I say closed and does not travel well
through time and space

1634
01:43:26,169 --> 01:43:28,799
So you're ready

1635
01:43:28,805 --> 01:43:32,641
Jesus
- Time and space?

1636
01:43:33,777 --> 01:43:37,147
Continued

1637
01:43:37,315 --> 01:43:38,214
Yes, if

1638
01:43:38,215 --> 01:43:42,919
You know sometimes I think about your letter

1639
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:46,050
You know you ... Do you live
southern Palepanese?

1640
01:43:46,424 --> 01:43:51,420
Yes, yes and ... we are here

1641
01:43:51,630 --> 01:43:57,263
And you think it might be tonight
you keep talking about your 80 years?

1642
01:43:57,836 --> 01:43:59,703
Well ...

1643
01:44:00,472 --> 01:44:04,035
It must have been a
night we will have.
