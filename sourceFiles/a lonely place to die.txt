1
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,323
Safe!

2
00:01:44,796 --> 00:01:45,910
Off belay!

3
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,002
Right, can you get my camera out,
please?

4
00:01:58,934 --> 00:02:00,808
Say it.

5
00:02:01,812 --> 00:02:03,555
- Come on.
- Don't take a picture.

6
00:02:03,647 --> 00:02:07,775
Give us a smile. I'm sure there's a
pretty face under that frown somewhere.

7
00:02:12,322 --> 00:02:15,358
- Is that the best you got?
- Afraid so.

8
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,023
- OK, get one of me.
- No, I'll take it at the top.

9
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:20,610
Yeah, but I wanna get
some of this background in.

10
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:22,080
Pass it over.

11
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:27,626
Try and get some of that exposure in.
Show how high up we are.

12
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,585
Is that a golden eagle?

13
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,303
Beautiful.

14
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:40,714
It's a golden eagle.
Buzzard. I don't know

15
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:43,133
Nah, it's way too big to be a buzzard.

16
00:02:51,026 --> 00:02:54,691
Alright, that's enough of the bird.
Point the camera at the money.

17
00:02:55,697 --> 00:02:57,191
Alison, come on.

18
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:00,776
- Stop pouting.
- What?

19
00:03:02,203 --> 00:03:03,994
It was a golden eagle.

20
00:03:49,206 --> 00:03:51,911
- Alison! Help me!
- Ed!

21
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:55,461
Jesus Christ, Alison!

22
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,288
- Shit!
- Rob, throw the rope.

23
00:03:58,382 --> 00:03:59,461
- Guys!
-Alison!

24
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,843
- Ed!
- Alison, please! It's slipping!

25
00:04:03,929 --> 00:04:05,589
It's gonna go!

26
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:14,514
I can't... I can't...
I can't get up!

27
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:19,310
- Help me!
- Rob!

28
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:21,898
Rob!

29
00:04:25,574 --> 00:04:28,990
- Ed, just breathe!

30
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:31,569
- It's not gonna hold!
- Ed! Ed!

31
00:04:31,664 --> 00:04:34,285
Ed, you have to listen to me.
Just breathe.

32
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,809
It's OK, but stop moving.
Keep it together.

33
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,221
Alright, alright.

34
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:57,553
Easy. OK, OK. Get your breath.

35
00:04:57,647 --> 00:05:00,517
Get your breath.
Jesus Christ, what happened, guys?

36
00:05:02,193 --> 00:05:05,229
- Alison, are you alright?
- Don't ask. Yeah, I'm fine.

37
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:09,021
Alright, mate, you're alright.
OK. Can you just pull yourself up?

38
00:05:09,116 --> 00:05:11,155
- Thank God.
- Alison, you OK?

39
00:05:11,243 --> 00:05:13,152
- I'm fine.
- Alright.

40
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:16,032
It's OK, keep going.
Just get your breath.

41
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:10,838
# As I came in by Fiddichside

42
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:14,792
# On a May morning

43
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:18,256
# I spied Willie Maclntosh

44
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:23,011
# An hour before the dawning

45
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:28,269
# Turn again, turn again, turn again

46
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:30,647
# I bid ye

47
00:06:30,736 --> 00:06:34,104
# If ye burn Auchindoun

48
00:06:34,197 --> 00:06:38,693
# Huntly he will heid ye

49
00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:43,027
# Heid me or hang me

50
00:06:43,122 --> 00:06:46,456
# That shall never fear me

51
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:49,745
# I'll burn Auchindoun

52
00:06:49,837 --> 00:06:55,044
# Though the life leaves me

53
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:25,697
# As I came in by Auchindoun
on a May morning

54
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:33,582
# Auchindoun was in a bleeze
an hour before the dawning

55
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:38,168
# Crawing, crawing

56
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:41,378
# For all your crouse crawing

57
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,302
# Ye burnt yer crop an' tint your wings

58
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:50,550
# An hour before the dawning

59
00:08:01,406 --> 00:08:03,612
I lost my bloody camera.

60
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,655
I feel sick
and my hands won't stop shaking.

61
00:08:06,744 --> 00:08:10,195
It's the adrenaline lag, mate.
Always hits you afterwards.

62
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,071
Hey, Ed.

63
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,960
Don't ever have a concentration lapse
like that again, OK?

64
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:19,667
You wanna climb with me,
you need to up your game.

65
00:08:19,756 --> 00:08:22,461
Methodical, every step. I mean it.

66
00:08:22,592 --> 00:08:25,677
Complacency is a killer out here.

67
00:08:25,762 --> 00:08:28,170
- We got away with cuts and bruises.
- Yeah.

68
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:33,222
Remind me why we do this again.

69
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:35,936
Because we don't surf.

70
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,625
- Hey.
- Hey.

71
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:00,496
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing, honey?

72
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,758
- What time did you get here?
- About an hour ago. Just unpacking.

73
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:11,627
Yeah, we took the double room
with the en suite. If that's OK?

74
00:09:11,723 --> 00:09:13,715
Fine. I'm not sleeping with him, am I?

75
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:16,268
Neither am I.

76
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:20,519
- I'm Ed, by the way.

77
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:23,524
Oh, Ed. I'm sorry, mate.
Ed, Jenny. Jenny, this is Ed.

78
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:24,640
Hi, Ed.

79
00:09:33,243 --> 00:09:34,821
No, after you.

80
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:39,534
OK?

81
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:42,119
Oh, right.

82
00:09:46,005 --> 00:09:49,042
Oh, honey, can you bring me
the cutlery, please, babe?

83
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:50,960
It's in the jug on the dresser.

84
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,879
Smells like someone's died in here.

85
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:57,305
Yeah, it is a little stinky.
I'll open a window, let some air in.

86
00:09:58,351 --> 00:10:00,639
That's just what Fred West
would have said.

87
00:10:00,728 --> 00:10:03,433
In future, you should
bury your relatives outdoors.

88
00:10:03,522 --> 00:10:04,851
Think patio.

89
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,854
If we had a phone in here, mate, you
could call up the landlord and complain.

90
00:10:08,944 --> 00:10:11,102
- There's no phone?
- No.

91
00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:12,441
Great.

92
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:18,406
And the window... is bust.

93
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:24,365
Any joy?

94
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:26,498
We've had a right result.

95
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,824
Hey, don't worry about her.

96
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:07,033
You know, with a bit of luck, she'll be
tucked up and fast asleep by now.

97
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,164
Your parents are such a pushover.

98
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:13,337
She runs rings round them.
She's such a little monkey.

99
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,878
I miss her.

100
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:19,960
It's only been two days, Jen.

101
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,134
Hmm.

102
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:42,616
Bollocks.

103
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,673
# You take the high road

104
00:12:06,765 --> 00:12:10,300
# And I'll take the low road
And I'll be in Scotland

105
00:12:10,393 --> 00:12:14,094
- # Afore you
- No, no, no!

106
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:17,771
It's horrible. Girls, girls, stop.
Seriously, it's horrible.

107
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:21,109
-Please, cards, go.
- OK. OK.

108
00:12:21,195 --> 00:12:22,571
But, erm...

109
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,905
Right, I need to know how much
one of these fellas is worth.

110
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:27,652
Five matchsticks. Er!

111
00:12:27,743 --> 00:12:31,788
- Er, no sex for you.

112
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:36,333
- And, OK, a bottle top?
- Two pasta swirls to a top.

113
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:41,504
Right. So then, ten matchsticks
makes one bottle top?

114
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,214
Yeah.

115
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,000
Great. OK, thanks, guys.
It's a bit confusing, is all.

116
00:12:47,095 --> 00:12:49,004
It really isn't.

117
00:12:49,097 --> 00:12:51,718
- Be nice.
- What are you doing, Jen?

118
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,091
Ladies and gentlemen, I fold.

119
00:12:55,395 --> 00:12:58,645
- What have you got that's so special?
- Erm...

120
00:12:58,731 --> 00:13:02,147
A pasta swirl and two tops
is what I'm gonna raise by.

121
00:13:02,235 --> 00:13:04,393
- I fold.
- Me, too.

122
00:13:05,821 --> 00:13:09,071
I'm gonna keep him honest. All in.

123
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:13,360
The water's warm. Jump on in.

124
00:13:14,538 --> 00:13:16,412
Yeah, right. Erm, all in.

125
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,996
- Three kings.
- Whoa.

126
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:28,133
- Oh, damn, I've only got three tens.
- A-ha! Get in, yer dancer!

127
00:13:28,218 --> 00:13:31,503
Come here, you lovely, lovely little...

128
00:13:31,596 --> 00:13:33,470
Oh, look at his wee face.

129
00:13:33,556 --> 00:13:35,881
I've got a pair of queens as well,
if that helps.

130
00:13:39,103 --> 00:13:43,314
Oh, come on, sit down, Alex. Shock's
best absorbed with the knees bent.

131
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,355
Full house. Let him take it.

132
00:13:47,444 --> 00:13:49,651
Don't spend it all in one pub.

133
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:52,445
I can retire to the Bahamas
like Roger Moore.

134
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:55,202
- You mean Sean Connery.
- I'm in the Roger Moore camp.

135
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:58,950
There's nothing wrong with 
a little bit of camp.

136
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,948
That's a horrible impression.

137
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,451
- It isn't.
- It is.

138
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:03,573
It's not!

139
00:14:08,256 --> 00:14:10,249
Alex, what is this? 
Where's the Queen?

140
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:12,713
That's legal tender.
It's a Scottish tenner.

141
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:16,218
It's worse than Monopoly money.
I can't buy anything with this.

142
00:14:16,305 --> 00:14:18,381
I've only got two words for you.

143
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:21,890
- Yeah, do they involve sex and travel?
- Possibly.

144
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:23,472
Well, don't say them.

145
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:26,646
That's our cue to leave.
Goodnight, everybody.

146
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:33,773
- Fuck off!
- Leave it. Goodnight!

147
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,984
Another round?

148
00:14:36,783 --> 00:14:39,570
Look, baby, I'm sorry.
I'm pissed. It was just banter.

149
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:43,361
- Yeah. I know. But it's not very sexy.
- I'm not trying to be sexy.

150
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:45,912
Why not? You're not on a promise.

151
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:54,217
- Deal.
- Will do.

152
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,591
Stick with me, we'll climb that 
this time next year.

153
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:03,254
The Eiger? Yeah, let's do it.
The north face.

154
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:06,685
It killed 70 people.

155
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:12,316
If you fall from the summit,
it'll take 30 seconds to hit the ground.

156
00:15:12,818 --> 00:15:15,937
- That's cheery.
- 30 seconds to recall your life,

157
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:18,485
say your goodbyes, conscious 
the whole way down.

158
00:15:18,573 --> 00:15:20,731
Just enough time to say 
the Lord's Prayer.

159
00:15:20,825 --> 00:15:25,202
- If you believe that's gonna save you.
- You're really gonna need something.

160
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:33,166
- It's blowing a bastard out there.
- Yeah, I know.

161
00:15:33,254 --> 00:15:36,208
It's, er, supposed to clear up
through the night, though.

162
00:15:36,298 --> 00:15:38,540
But tomorrow is gonna be tricky.

163
00:15:40,094 --> 00:15:41,422
Drink?

164
00:15:42,971 --> 00:15:44,051
Fill her up.

165
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:47,722
- No, you can't mix gin and whisky.
- It's called a gisky.

166
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:49,185
- Is it?
- I just invented it.

167
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:50,847
- Right.
- Gisky?

168
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:54,395
- Gisky. Would you like one?
- No, I'll pass.

169
00:16:06,494 --> 00:16:09,067
Alright, folks, slight change 
of plan, I think.

170
00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:12,497
There are 40mph winds on that peak,
but they're gusting 60.

171
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:17,044
It's supposed to die down tonight, so I
think we'll do the west face tomorrow

172
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:19,501
and just tackle the north ridge today.

173
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,045
It's nothing more than a diff.
You know, V diff.

174
00:16:22,134 --> 00:16:26,131
So don't worry about rock shoes, helmets
or anything that'll weigh you down.

175
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:28,379
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

176
00:16:28,473 --> 00:16:30,181
How's the exposure on the ridge?

177
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:33,137
A bit thought provoking,
but keep hold of your harness.

178
00:16:33,228 --> 00:16:36,431
- I've got mine and we'll take the rope.
- OK, good.

179
00:16:36,523 --> 00:16:38,562
Got all your gear?
Don't leave anything.

180
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,437
The only thing I left is for 
a fully qualified plumber.

181
00:16:41,527 --> 00:16:42,856
Charming.

182
00:16:45,114 --> 00:16:47,439
- Good morning.
- Hey, how's the head?

183
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:50,736
Two cups of coffee and three aspirin,
I'm almost human again.

184
00:16:52,705 --> 00:16:53,784
OK?

185
00:16:53,873 --> 00:16:56,198
So I guess it's a no-go
on the west face, hmm?

186
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:59,956
No. This isn't Yosemite. The weather
up here does exactly what it wants.

187
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,367
Yeah.

188
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:06,842
- Got the lunch, Jen?
- Yeah, that's all under control.

189
00:17:06,927 --> 00:17:09,678
- What are we having?
- Sandwiches.

190
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:14,306
Ah. The pinnacle of British cuisine.
No wonder the French hate us.

191
00:17:14,392 --> 00:17:17,263
- I make a pretty good sandwich.
- Well, what's in them?

192
00:17:17,353 --> 00:17:19,809
Just wait and see.
The surprise is half the fun.

193
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:21,890
Just as long as it's not fish.

194
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,316
You should try one. They're yummy.

195
00:17:26,404 --> 00:17:29,440
Smoked mackerel and egg?
I'd rather eat my own shit.

196
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:31,690
No one's stopping you.

197
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:35,651
You could always scrape out the mackerel
and just eat the bread.

198
00:17:35,746 --> 00:17:38,319
No, I can't do that. It's been tainted.

199
00:17:38,415 --> 00:17:39,993
You remind me of my daughter.

200
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,497
She's clearly a lady of impeccable taste.

201
00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:43,784
She's two.

202
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,255
You're such a fussy eater.
It's so surprising at your age.

203
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:51,963
Surprise is half the fun, right?

204
00:17:52,095 --> 00:17:53,922
Thank fuck I brought chocolate.

205
00:17:54,013 --> 00:17:56,683
Five minutes and we're off.
Everybody OK with that?

206
00:17:56,766 --> 00:17:58,426
Sounds good.

207
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:07,438
It's beautiful.

208
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:11,279
I know. Scenery like this
makes me wish I could paint.

209
00:18:11,363 --> 00:18:12,608
I'm gonna take a piss.

210
00:18:12,698 --> 00:18:15,782
- Yeah, good to know.
- Thought you might be interested.

211
00:18:15,868 --> 00:18:18,868
No, no, mate, you feel free
to keep us updated at all times.

212
00:18:18,954 --> 00:18:20,413
Will do.

213
00:18:22,582 --> 00:18:26,911
I've found a cracking spot.
I'm unbuttoning my fly.

214
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:31,380
I'm getting it out.
Fucking hell, it weighs a ton.

215
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:32,841
Shut up, wanker.

216
00:18:56,073 --> 00:18:58,860
Hey, guys! I heard something.

217
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,907
Oh, yeah, what?

218
00:19:00,994 --> 00:19:05,455
I dunno. Something.
Come here and check it out.

219
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,829
Mate, you think I'm falling for that?

220
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,955
I'm serious.

221
00:19:24,225 --> 00:19:25,932
What is it?

222
00:19:28,145 --> 00:19:30,470
- What's going on up there?
- Hold on a sec!

223
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:33,481
Just listen.

224
00:19:36,027 --> 00:19:37,605
D'you hear that?

225
00:19:41,116 --> 00:19:42,907
I heard it.

226
00:19:42,992 --> 00:19:45,032
- What is it then?
- An animal?

227
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:47,787
- No way.
- Then what?

228
00:19:47,872 --> 00:19:49,865
- Sounds to me like...
- Like what?

229
00:19:52,043 --> 00:19:53,323
A person.

230
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:58,172
- Guys, get over here.
- What is it?

231
00:19:58,257 --> 00:20:00,048
Just get over here.

232
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:17,393
- What is it?
- Shh. Listen.

233
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:26,443
- I hear it.
- Yeah, me too.

234
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:24,119
What is that?

235
00:21:24,214 --> 00:21:25,839
I've no idea.

236
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:34,926
- Shit.
- What?

237
00:21:36,184 --> 00:21:38,307
It's a breathing tube.

238
00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:41,307
There's someone down there.

239
00:21:42,106 --> 00:21:43,565
Just wait here, guys. Wait!

240
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:12,876
Hello?

241
00:22:12,969 --> 00:22:15,970
- Jesus Christ!

242
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:21,183
- Jesus Christ.
- What the hell is that?

243
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:22,977
Don't you mean who?

244
00:22:26,857 --> 00:22:28,102
What do we do?

245
00:22:30,152 --> 00:22:31,231
Ed.

246
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,274
Wait a sec, guys.

247
00:22:35,783 --> 00:22:37,442
Hello?

248
00:22:40,454 --> 00:22:42,411
If you can hear us, say something!

249
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:45,739
Oh, Jesus.

250
00:22:46,501 --> 00:22:48,826
This was dug recently.
The earth's still soft.

251
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,663
Why would somebody be down there?

252
00:22:50,755 --> 00:22:53,791
- I told you I heard something.

253
00:22:53,883 --> 00:22:56,421
We're gonna help you.
Just sit tight for a moment.

254
00:22:58,763 --> 00:23:01,467
- What are you doing?
- We don't know what's down there.

255
00:23:01,557 --> 00:23:03,633
- It sounds like a child.
- I think so, too.

256
00:23:03,726 --> 00:23:05,683
We can think, but we don't fucking know.

257
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:08,177
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Guys, it's made of wood.

258
00:23:09,648 --> 00:23:13,099
- See if we can find the corners.
- This is insane. What are you doing?

259
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:15,815
Get down here! Help us.
Fucking kneel down and help.

260
00:23:15,904 --> 00:23:18,146
- Come on!

261
00:23:20,492 --> 00:23:23,742
Right, we're gonna try
and lift it, OK? On three.

262
00:23:23,828 --> 00:23:26,533
One, two, three.

263
00:23:30,084 --> 00:23:31,662
Fuck.

264
00:23:32,337 --> 00:23:34,376
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus.

265
00:23:38,134 --> 00:23:40,126
Alright. Hello.

266
00:23:41,095 --> 00:23:44,630
Now don't be afraid. We're gonna 
get you out of there. Alright?

267
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,052
Ed?

268
00:23:47,184 --> 00:23:49,093
- Come on.

269
00:23:49,186 --> 00:23:51,938
No, no, no. Don't worry,
we're not gonna hurt you.

270
00:23:52,022 --> 00:23:55,106
OK, darling? We're not gonna hurt you.
Come on.

271
00:23:57,027 --> 00:23:59,778
For fuck's sake, you're scaring her!
Leave her alone.

272
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:04,236
It's OK, sweetie.

273
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:06,110
Alright. Alright.

274
00:24:07,203 --> 00:24:08,234
It's OK.

275
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:12,622
It's alright. I'm not gonna hurt you.

276
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:15,793
It's OK. We're gonna get you out of here.

277
00:24:16,963 --> 00:24:18,622
Come on, sweetie.

278
00:24:18,714 --> 00:24:20,422
It's alright.

279
00:24:21,467 --> 00:24:24,040
It's OK. Good girl. It's OK.

280
00:24:26,972 --> 00:24:29,012
It's OK.

281
00:24:29,892 --> 00:24:32,809
- OK, honey. Help.
- OK.

282
00:24:34,104 --> 00:24:35,349
OK.

283
00:24:35,438 --> 00:24:38,938
Let's get you out of here.
Come up. Come up.

284
00:24:39,025 --> 00:24:40,733
Can you get me some water?

285
00:24:45,281 --> 00:24:48,448
Sit down. It's alright, 
it's alright. OK.

286
00:24:48,534 --> 00:24:52,235
OK. OK. Here you go. There you go.

287
00:24:53,664 --> 00:24:57,413
Slowly. Drink slowly.
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

288
00:24:57,501 --> 00:25:00,704
Alright. Good girl.

289
00:25:00,796 --> 00:25:04,046
Oh. Alright. It's OK.

290
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:07,003
It's alright, it's alright. It's OK.

291
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:11,048
Sweetie, can you tell...

292
00:25:12,432 --> 00:25:15,766
Can you tell me your name? Your name?

293
00:25:16,686 --> 00:25:19,722
I'm Jenny. Jenny.

294
00:25:20,773 --> 00:25:22,683
What's your name?

295
00:25:22,775 --> 00:25:24,934
- Anna.
- Anna.

296
00:25:25,862 --> 00:25:27,570
OK, Anna.

297
00:25:28,865 --> 00:25:32,233
- Anna, where are you from?

298
00:25:36,455 --> 00:25:38,661
OK. Alright.

299
00:25:41,835 --> 00:25:44,955
Anna, do you speak English?

300
00:25:45,047 --> 00:25:50,717
Anna? English? Does anyone know
what language that is?

301
00:25:50,802 --> 00:25:52,878
I dunno. Is it Russian, maybe?

302
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:56,137
- Might be Croatian.
- How do you know that?

303
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,889
Well, I had an ex-girlfriend from Zagreb
and she'd swear at me in Croat.

304
00:25:59,978 --> 00:26:03,014
- You're sure that's what it is?
- She used to swear at me a lot.

305
00:26:03,106 --> 00:26:06,688
- Can you understand what she's saying?
- No. The accent sounds familiar.

306
00:26:06,776 --> 00:26:08,852
Well, do you speak any Croat?

307
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:11,151
I could score an eighth,
ask for a threesome.

308
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:13,030
- Ah, Jesus.
- Oh, for God's sake.

309
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:15,571
- Dick.
- Sorry.

310
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:19,988
- Why would someone do this?
- They didn't want her to die.

311
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:24,286
Otherwise there wouldn't be an air pipe.

312
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:28,124
I don't want to know who put her
down there or why they did it.

313
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:30,751
I just want to get out of here
before they come back.

314
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,331
Listen, listen.
She's our responsibility now.

315
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:35,626
We've got to get help.
We've got to get her

316
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:37,964
off these mountains soon.

317
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:45,679
OK. Right, we're here, 12 miles
south-southwest of Alltnacaillich.

318
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,523
The nearest village is Annan Mor, so...

319
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,351
Yeah.

320
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:54,310
We could go east along the Scimitar
Ridge until we get to the river,

321
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:57,773
then double back to the village.
It's about 15, 20 miles all in.

322
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:01,069
I found this in the hole.
She must've been down there for days.

323
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,197
- Did she have any food?
- Didn't look like it.

324
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,907
She must have been starving
down there all by herself in the dark.

325
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,539
Let's not kill her with
a smoked mackerel sandwich.

326
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,917
Can we use your phone? Phone for help?

327
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,583
What, in these mountains?

328
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:18,043
Won't get anything approaching
a signal till you get near the A9.

329
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,630
That's about 30 miles away.

330
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,211
You said it was 15 miles to the village.

331
00:27:23,766 --> 00:27:27,182
There is a faster route.
We're only two miles from Devil's Drop.

332
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:30,638
- What's Devil's Drop?
- The only way to breach the ridge.

333
00:27:30,731 --> 00:27:33,222
It's a sheer cliff face
500 foot straight down,

334
00:27:33,317 --> 00:27:37,528
but from there, it is only
a four-mile hike to Annan Mor.

335
00:27:38,238 --> 00:27:40,278
How do we get a child down Devil's Drop?

336
00:27:41,241 --> 00:27:44,574
We don't. Two of us abseil down
and run to the village for help,

337
00:27:44,661 --> 00:27:48,196
alert the police and get the Highland
Rescue to pick up the rest of you.

338
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:51,658
- Who are you gonna take with you?
- Alison.

339
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:54,538
Sorry, Ed, no arguments, mate.
I need the best.

340
00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:58,840
It's a massive face, Rob.
I mean, we don't have enough rope.

341
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:01,131
I've got 20 metres of seven mil
if that helps.

342
00:28:01,218 --> 00:28:02,962
No, no, you keep that with you.

343
00:28:03,053 --> 00:28:06,422
There's some rough terrain.
You might need it. We'll manage.

344
00:28:06,557 --> 00:28:09,973
- We'll multi pitch it. It'll be fine.
- Do you want us to wait here?

345
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,266
No. There's no way we're staying here.

346
00:28:12,354 --> 00:28:17,230
Follow the route on the map. I'll make
sure they get the helicopter out to you.

347
00:28:17,317 --> 00:28:20,353
As long as you stick to that route,
they'll find you easily.

348
00:29:00,066 --> 00:29:03,103
- Yeah, that's it. There it is. See?
- Where?

349
00:29:03,194 --> 00:29:05,946
That's the Haston Step.
It's the first belay point.

350
00:29:16,665 --> 00:29:19,951
- You wanna go first?
- Yeah.

351
00:30:14,971 --> 00:30:16,430
Rob?

352
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:20,804
Fuck! Rob, there's no more rope.

353
00:30:20,894 --> 00:30:23,266
Can you make it?

354
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:32,813
- Easy.
- Shit. Shit!

355
00:30:34,073 --> 00:30:35,816
Easy.

356
00:31:14,445 --> 00:31:18,442
Alison! How is it?

357
00:31:18,532 --> 00:31:20,109
Fucking scary, Rob.

358
00:31:21,576 --> 00:31:25,028
There's no footholds for five feet.
You be careful, OK?

359
00:32:00,655 --> 00:32:02,066
Rob!

360
00:32:06,995 --> 00:32:10,695
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

361
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:14,289
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

362
00:32:28,724 --> 00:32:32,389
Look, why don't we carry her?
Me and Ed could take it in turns.

363
00:32:32,478 --> 00:32:34,137
- Makes sense.
- OK.

364
00:32:35,564 --> 00:32:37,141
- Come on.
- Here you go.

365
00:32:37,232 --> 00:32:39,106
Be gentle.

366
00:32:39,192 --> 00:32:40,521
Anna!

367
00:32:43,113 --> 00:32:44,358
- Come on.
- Jesus Christ!

368
00:32:44,447 --> 00:32:45,823
- Put her down.
- Whoa.

369
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:51,202
Right, so what do we do now?
You won't be able to carry her.

370
00:32:51,704 --> 00:32:56,081
- I can try.
- You'll collapse after 100 yards.

371
00:32:57,126 --> 00:32:58,786
Then we'll go at Anna's pace.

372
00:32:58,878 --> 00:33:01,665
- That's pretty fucking slow.
- Watch your language.

373
00:33:01,756 --> 00:33:03,997
- She can't understand.
- Hardly the point.

374
00:33:04,091 --> 00:33:07,294
- For fuck's sake.
- We've gotta keep moving. Come on.

375
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:10,007
Do you have any idea
what she's been through?

376
00:33:10,097 --> 00:33:13,929
I get it, OK?
Can we just go now? Please?

377
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:16,674
- Come on.
- OK.

378
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:19,012
Come on, sweetie. We have to go.

379
00:34:18,037 --> 00:34:19,235
Fuck!

380
00:34:21,165 --> 00:34:22,327
Jesus!

381
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:26,333
Fuck. Fuck it. Fuck!

382
00:34:37,347 --> 00:34:40,051
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

383
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:41,708
Hey!

384
00:36:44,218 --> 00:36:45,297
Hey!

385
00:36:48,347 --> 00:36:49,971
Help!

386
00:36:58,857 --> 00:37:00,232
Fuck you!

387
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:03,728
Fuck you.

388
00:38:22,562 --> 00:38:24,104
It's been cut!

389
00:38:39,078 --> 00:38:41,699
I think it's about a mile away
to the river.

390
00:38:51,256 --> 00:38:52,750
There they are.

391
00:38:57,554 --> 00:39:00,757
- I see them.
- How far?

392
00:39:01,683 --> 00:39:05,052
400 yards, maybe more.

393
00:39:05,144 --> 00:39:09,094
- You got a shot?
- At this range?

394
00:39:10,608 --> 00:39:13,562
Don't waste it.
Let's get over that next ridge.

395
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,590
There they are.

396
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:54,015
Chuck us over your hip flask
and give me a nip.

397
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,654
What is this filthy shit?

398
00:40:04,743 --> 00:40:07,946
- It's spirit drink.
- Spirit drink?

399
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:12,166
I got it at the petrol garage. It's so
cheap they can't even call it vodka.

400
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:15,002
- It's pish.
- It gets the job done.

401
00:40:24,136 --> 00:40:25,417
Hello there.

402
00:40:26,305 --> 00:40:27,716
Good afternoon.

403
00:40:30,226 --> 00:40:32,052
What are you fellas doing out here?

404
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,597
Hiking.

405
00:40:37,191 --> 00:40:39,479
Long way from civilisation.

406
00:40:39,568 --> 00:40:41,442
That's the idea.

407
00:40:41,528 --> 00:40:42,939
You stalking?

408
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:45,187
Yeah.

409
00:40:46,032 --> 00:40:48,867
You know the hunting season's been over
for three months?

410
00:40:48,994 --> 00:40:50,274
What do you care?

411
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:55,577
It's just if you're hunting out of
season, we're gonna have to report you.

412
00:40:56,626 --> 00:40:58,499
That's a pretty big gun.

413
00:40:58,586 --> 00:41:02,121
It's a 308. It'll put a dent
in just about anything.

414
00:41:03,758 --> 00:41:05,880
You think the deer
have a fighting chance?

415
00:41:06,635 --> 00:41:09,257
I think everything's
got a fighting chance.

416
00:41:11,307 --> 00:41:12,801
Do you?

417
00:41:12,891 --> 00:41:15,513
You boys a pair of animal rights
wankers, are you?

418
00:41:15,602 --> 00:41:17,180
You're a long way from anywhere.

419
00:41:17,271 --> 00:41:20,722
Me and him don't take kindly to
left-wing bastards coming out here...

420
00:41:24,861 --> 00:41:29,108
Please. Oh, please, don't do it.
I'll stop hunting.

421
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:32,107
But everything's got a fighting chance,
right?

422
00:41:34,787 --> 00:41:36,495
He said that.

423
00:41:37,665 --> 00:41:39,704
Please. Please don't kill me.

424
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:41,452
Take a step back.

425
00:41:41,544 --> 00:41:44,117
- Oh, God, please. Please, no.
- Hey.

426
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:46,412
Do it.

427
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:49,839
- Jesus Christ.
- Keep going.

428
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:51,551
Oh, God, no.

429
00:41:51,637 --> 00:41:53,546
That's it.

430
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:55,715
- And another.
- Please. Oh, fuck.

431
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:58,844
- Don't stop.
- Oh, dear God!

432
00:42:09,696 --> 00:42:11,071
And that's that.

433
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:26,700
You still with me?

434
00:42:29,882 --> 00:42:31,376
Whatever it takes.

435
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:34,374
I think it might take a bit more
than we thought.

436
00:42:37,848 --> 00:42:40,552
Aye. It might.

437
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,360
How did they sound?

438
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:59,231
Practised. In control. Like they knew
exactly what they were doing.

439
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,485
That's usually a good sign.

440
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,907
Follow the road.

441
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:07,290
- Remind me of the name of this place.
- Annan Mor. Southwest of Inverness.

442
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,249
Still a good 80 miles.

443
00:43:31,983 --> 00:43:33,228
Hey!

444
00:43:35,611 --> 00:43:37,022
Hey!

445
00:43:37,154 --> 00:43:40,903
Look. Look. Look. Alison.

446
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,235
The rope was cut.

447
00:43:45,329 --> 00:43:49,907
The rope was cut.
Someone cut the rope.

448
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,372
- Can you hear her?
- She's smashed her legs up.

449
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,545
You can see it in her leg and her arms.
Something's wrong, Jen.

450
00:43:56,798 --> 00:43:58,956
It's alright, sweetheart,
don't be scared.

451
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:00,330
Don't be scared. It's OK.

452
00:44:00,426 --> 00:44:05,135
Someone cut the rope. Rob was murdered.

453
00:44:05,223 --> 00:44:07,595
- Can you hear what she's saying?
- Look at her leg.

454
00:44:07,683 --> 00:44:10,850
We can't understand
a word you're saying.

455
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:17,475
I need to get across to you
further down the river.

456
00:44:17,568 --> 00:44:22,858
Alison! Alison, you're gonna 
have to shout louder.

457
00:44:22,948 --> 00:44:26,198
We need to find a crossing
further downstream.

458
00:44:29,204 --> 00:44:33,071
She wants us to go down the river.
OK, OK. Where's Rob?

459
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:34,785
Rob, where is he?

460
00:44:34,876 --> 00:44:36,500
Where is he?

461
00:44:46,929 --> 00:44:48,210
Fuck!

462
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,428
What are we gonna do, Jen?

463
00:44:59,691 --> 00:45:01,483
What do we do?

464
00:45:06,323 --> 00:45:07,698
No.

465
00:45:19,794 --> 00:45:22,463
- Jen! Jenny!
- Alex!

466
00:45:22,547 --> 00:45:25,962
- Jenny! Jenny!

467
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:27,378
Alex, Alex, Alex, no!

468
00:45:27,468 --> 00:45:29,757
Jenny! Jenny! Jenny!

469
00:45:29,845 --> 00:45:32,763
- Listen to me. Alex!
- Jenny, give me your hand.

470
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,888
Alex, she's gone!

471
00:45:39,563 --> 00:45:42,136
We can't get her from here.
We've gotta go down there.

472
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,985
Ed, Ed, I can see her.

473
00:45:57,288 --> 00:46:01,036
Hold on to the rocks, Jen.
Hold on to the rocks.

474
00:46:07,089 --> 00:46:09,295
- Hold on to the rocks!
- Alex, listen to me.

475
00:46:09,383 --> 00:46:12,088
You have to follow me.
I know what I'm doing. Follow me.

476
00:46:48,754 --> 00:46:49,833
Alison!

477
00:46:51,632 --> 00:46:52,960
Alison!

478
00:46:54,926 --> 00:46:56,753
Come on, come on!

479
00:47:33,922 --> 00:47:35,500
Anna!

480
00:47:38,426 --> 00:47:39,671
Anna!

481
00:47:45,808 --> 00:47:47,468
Anna!

482
00:48:29,892 --> 00:48:31,137
No. Gone.

483
00:48:36,106 --> 00:48:37,221
There!

484
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:55,950
Anna!

485
00:48:56,835 --> 00:49:00,001
Anna! Anna!

486
00:49:00,088 --> 00:49:02,045
Anna!

487
00:50:04,608 --> 00:50:06,933
Come on, Anna.

488
00:50:07,027 --> 00:50:09,233
Come on, Anna. Come on.

489
00:50:19,247 --> 00:50:21,073
OK. Anna.

490
00:50:31,175 --> 00:50:33,084
It's OK, Anna.

491
00:51:22,891 --> 00:51:26,141
Anna! Anna!

492
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,082
Alex. Alex.

493
00:52:02,637 --> 00:52:04,297
Are you alright?

494
00:52:05,306 --> 00:52:06,469
Look at me.

495
00:52:09,352 --> 00:52:13,349
- We have to find the others, OK?
- Right.

496
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,099
Ed!

497
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,431
Anna?

498
00:52:20,988 --> 00:52:22,945
Ed!

499
00:53:09,993 --> 00:53:12,401
- Here!

500
00:53:55,161 --> 00:53:56,953
Ed.

501
00:53:57,038 --> 00:53:58,497
Anna.

502
00:53:58,581 --> 00:53:59,992
Ed.

503
00:54:02,502 --> 00:54:06,036
Anna. Thank God. Shh. Shh.

504
00:54:10,468 --> 00:54:11,582
What happened?

505
00:54:11,677 --> 00:54:15,212
I fell. It might be broken,
I don't know.

506
00:54:22,312 --> 00:54:24,139
They're coming.

507
00:54:24,231 --> 00:54:25,641
- How many?
- Two.

508
00:54:25,732 --> 00:54:27,357
Shit.

509
00:54:30,695 --> 00:54:33,268
- OK, let's go.
- No. He can't run.

510
00:54:33,364 --> 00:54:36,318
- I can try.
- That won't be enough.

511
00:54:38,828 --> 00:54:43,786
Look, listen. You, me, Ed,
we don't mean a thing to these people.

512
00:54:43,874 --> 00:54:47,539
She's the only one with any value.
She's what they want.

513
00:54:56,428 --> 00:54:57,459
That's her!

514
00:55:01,141 --> 00:55:03,679
- What about the others?
- Follow the money!

515
00:57:03,633 --> 00:57:06,468
Are you gonna finish him
or do you want me to do it?

516
00:57:06,552 --> 00:57:10,597
After what he's just put us through?
No, I wanna watch him breathe out.

517
00:57:20,649 --> 00:57:22,393
You feel that?

518
00:57:24,403 --> 00:57:26,775
That's the price of your nobility.

519
00:57:29,658 --> 00:57:31,567
Hurts, doesn't it?

520
00:57:43,796 --> 00:57:46,750
In 200 metres, bear left.

521
00:57:49,218 --> 00:57:52,089
In 150 metres, bear left.

522
00:57:52,513 --> 00:57:53,924
In one...

523
00:57:57,518 --> 00:57:58,763
Well done.

524
00:58:00,396 --> 00:58:04,642
- How will we know where to go?
- Maybe we should just bear left.

525
00:58:04,733 --> 00:58:08,351
People have been finding their way
for years without fucking computers.

526
00:58:08,445 --> 00:58:11,565
There is no equal to a map
and a bit of nous.

527
00:58:11,656 --> 00:58:14,147
- How are we doing back there?
- I'm almost done.

528
00:58:14,242 --> 00:58:16,400
Just gotta check the frequency.

529
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:20,618
If this briefcase moves so much
as an inch, we're gonna know about it.

530
00:58:20,707 --> 00:58:22,498
Well, that's reassuring.

531
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:26,118
I may as well wipe my arse on that money
if we can't find the girl.

532
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:58,945
OK.

533
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:02,445
OK, Anna, I'm gonna need you
to lean back.

534
00:59:03,789 --> 00:59:05,165
Just take a step.

535
00:59:05,249 --> 00:59:07,455
It's OK, sweetheart.
Just, just lean back.

536
00:59:10,754 --> 00:59:14,289
You gotta trust me. It's OK, I promise.
Just take a step back and lean...

537
00:59:14,383 --> 00:59:16,210
No, Alison. Alison.

538
00:59:16,301 --> 00:59:19,670
Jesus Christ, Anna!
There's no other way down!

539
00:59:21,723 --> 00:59:23,098
OK.

540
00:59:26,311 --> 00:59:29,431
Look at me. Look at me. I've got you.

541
00:59:30,815 --> 00:59:32,808
You have to trust me, sweetheart.

542
00:59:33,484 --> 00:59:34,729
OK?

543
00:59:34,819 --> 00:59:38,318
Put your shoulders back. Lean back.

544
00:59:38,406 --> 00:59:40,363
There you go.

545
00:59:40,449 --> 00:59:43,569
Good girl. Good girl.

546
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:53,251
- It's OK, Anna. Keep coming.

547
00:59:53,337 --> 00:59:55,578
Oops. Keep coming. Steady, steady.

548
01:00:02,429 --> 01:00:06,296
OK. Alright. I've got you. I've got you.

549
01:00:32,958 --> 01:00:36,872
- This is no time for a rest. Let's go.
- Just give me a moment, please.

550
01:00:36,962 --> 01:00:39,417
If Alex made it, he'd have 
called the police.

551
01:00:41,675 --> 01:00:43,548
They could already be looking for us.

552
01:00:44,427 --> 01:00:46,005
You heard the shots, Alison.

553
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:49,008
He's dead.

554
01:00:53,311 --> 01:00:54,935
Let's go. Get up.

555
01:00:55,479 --> 01:00:56,938
Get up!

556
01:00:58,441 --> 01:00:59,935
Leave me here.

557
01:01:01,902 --> 01:01:04,274
I'm slowing you down as it is.
Just leave me here.

558
01:01:04,363 --> 01:01:06,439
- You don't want that.
- I've broken my leg.

559
01:01:06,532 --> 01:01:09,698
- What more do you want?
- It's not broken. You're walking on it.

560
01:01:13,163 --> 01:01:16,947
- What if we've done the wrong thing?
- What do you mean?

561
01:01:21,796 --> 01:01:24,370
Maybe we should have left her there.

562
01:01:24,465 --> 01:01:27,881
- What?
- Hear me out. Please.

563
01:01:27,969 --> 01:01:29,760
Please listen to me.

564
01:01:30,763 --> 01:01:32,138
Why was she even there?

565
01:01:32,223 --> 01:01:35,093
Why in Scotland? She clearly 
sounds Eastern European.

566
01:01:35,184 --> 01:01:37,342
I don't know, Ed.
I don't know. You tell me.

567
01:01:37,436 --> 01:01:40,520
Maybe she was kidnapped.
She's still in her school uniform.

568
01:01:40,606 --> 01:01:43,393
She was probably snatched
right outside the school.

569
01:01:43,484 --> 01:01:46,401
Kidnappers usually demand a ransom,
don't they?

570
01:01:47,654 --> 01:01:52,482
In which case there's probably
another party involved, police.

571
01:01:53,285 --> 01:01:56,784
And what if we've come along
and trampled on a delicate situation?

572
01:01:57,497 --> 01:02:00,581
We might have blown her chances
of a safe handover.

573
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:02,960
What if we've killed her?

574
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:05,709
What if this is all our fault?

575
01:02:05,797 --> 01:02:07,789
- Look at her.
- I'm just...

576
01:02:07,882 --> 01:02:09,459
Just fucking look at her.

577
01:02:10,718 --> 01:02:14,632
Could you leave her in the ground?
Could you?

578
01:02:16,515 --> 01:02:17,546
No.

579
01:02:19,226 --> 01:02:20,637
Then there's your answer.

580
01:02:22,646 --> 01:02:25,931
Did her family do this to her?
Was she kidnapped? I don't know.

581
01:02:26,024 --> 01:02:28,895
And you don't know.
But if we've done the wrong thing,

582
01:02:28,985 --> 01:02:32,734
then I'll fucking live with it.
Now get up! Find a way.

583
01:02:36,201 --> 01:02:38,158
They'll be heading up to Annan Mor.

584
01:02:38,828 --> 01:02:42,162
And here we are, empty fucking handed.

585
01:02:43,499 --> 01:02:46,749
Look, you remember that Japanese kid
last winter? Remember him?

586
01:02:46,836 --> 01:02:49,124
Rats crawled through the pipe,
ate him alive.

587
01:02:49,213 --> 01:02:51,751
- What about him?
- Parents still paid up.

588
01:02:51,841 --> 01:02:55,968
Bluffed our way out of that. Maybe
we can't bluff our way out of this.

589
01:02:57,221 --> 01:03:00,755
You do it your way. I'll try mine.

590
01:03:12,235 --> 01:03:14,643
You're probably wondering

591
01:03:14,737 --> 01:03:16,647
why your daughter has not come home.

592
01:03:16,739 --> 01:03:20,191
We have dug a hole,
four feet by three. She's down there.

593
01:03:20,326 --> 01:03:24,620
She has enough water for a week,
maybe less. She has no food.

594
01:03:24,705 --> 01:03:26,662
There's no chance you can find her.

595
01:03:26,749 --> 01:03:30,747
Her location is as remote
as it is inaccessible.

596
01:03:30,836 --> 01:03:32,081
You're being watched.

597
01:03:32,171 --> 01:03:35,374
If you try and contact the police,
we will leave her where she is.

598
01:03:35,466 --> 01:03:39,131
She will die there. In the dark. Alone.

599
01:03:39,219 --> 01:03:41,377
You will never find her body.

600
01:03:41,471 --> 01:03:44,472
We want money. Six million euros.

601
01:03:44,558 --> 01:03:49,385
Clean, non-sequential. No marked money,
transponders or dye packs.

602
01:03:49,479 --> 01:03:52,433
More instructions regarding 
the hand-off will follow.

603
01:03:52,524 --> 01:03:54,183
Stay by the phone.

604
01:03:55,902 --> 01:03:56,981
Who taped the call?

605
01:03:57,737 --> 01:04:02,814
My employer records everything.
That includes his ex-wife's telephone.

606
01:04:03,617 --> 01:04:06,239
Well, these bastards aren't stupid,
are they?

607
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:10,284
If you call the police and they get
nicked, they just gotta deny everything.

608
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:13,582
Since the girl's in the ground,
there's no connection to us.

609
01:04:13,669 --> 01:04:15,079
She dies about the same time

610
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:17,791
that the police release them
due to lack of evidence.

611
01:04:17,881 --> 01:04:20,039
There's no body, no murder investigation.

612
01:04:20,133 --> 01:04:22,589
That is about as sweet a hustle
as I've ever seen.

613
01:04:22,677 --> 01:04:26,046
The only time they expose themselves
is at the hand-off.

614
01:04:27,557 --> 01:04:29,882
Do you know where the pub is?

615
01:04:29,976 --> 01:04:32,811
It's not a big village. I'll find it.

616
01:04:32,895 --> 01:04:35,386
When you get there, you grab 
a table by the window.

617
01:04:35,481 --> 01:04:38,233
If you can't find one,
you stand by the bar and you wait.

618
01:04:38,317 --> 01:04:40,642
No one will approach you
until you sit down.

619
01:04:40,736 --> 01:04:42,776
Don't try and guess who it's gonna be.

620
01:04:42,863 --> 01:04:45,533
Think about nothing except that table.
Understand?

621
01:04:45,616 --> 01:04:46,731
Yeah.

622
01:04:48,619 --> 01:04:52,035
Don't look too confident.
Don't look too nervous either.

623
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:55,989
You find a middle ground. You let 'em
know that it's strictly business.

624
01:04:56,084 --> 01:04:59,535
If they've got the girl,
they're gonna get paid.

625
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:02,500
- Let's hope they bring her.
- They will. They have to.

626
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:06,540
They'll keep her out of sight until they
see the money. That's where you come in.

627
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:09,921
You demand to see her
before you hand it over.

628
01:05:10,014 --> 01:05:12,766
If they can get away without making 
a trade, they will.

629
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:16,718
Leaving a body behind is a lot easier
than making a full exchange.

630
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:21,770
No one makes a move until we see
the girl. If I return without her...

631
01:05:25,863 --> 01:05:27,654
Have you met her father?

632
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:30,491
I've heard of him by reputation.

633
01:05:36,373 --> 01:05:39,374
- So you know that...
- He's got a pretty bad reputation.

634
01:05:40,293 --> 01:05:45,334
Have a jolly up in Kosovo, did he?
Little bit of an ethnic spring clean?

635
01:05:46,257 --> 01:05:49,756
Same as the rest of the Serbian wankers
that we slotted back in '99.

636
01:05:49,844 --> 01:05:54,257
So trust me, yes, I know who 
I'm dealing with.

637
01:05:54,348 --> 01:05:56,222
Really?

638
01:05:56,308 --> 01:05:59,843
When we make our move,
it's gonna be quick and loud.

639
01:05:59,937 --> 01:06:03,851
Throw yourself on the floor cos he's
gonna go like fucking Christian Bale.

640
01:06:03,941 --> 01:06:06,432
Stay down till me or him picks you up.

641
01:06:06,527 --> 01:06:10,227
All I care about is the girl.
We get her safe and quick.

642
01:06:10,322 --> 01:06:11,946
Then we worry about her captors.

643
01:06:12,032 --> 01:06:14,902
Your employers, they wanna 
keep 'em alive?

644
01:06:14,993 --> 01:06:17,566
- If possible.
- We'll see.

645
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:23,408
No shotguns. I can't risk you 
hitting the girl.

646
01:06:23,543 --> 01:06:25,831
It's loaded with solid shot, no spread.

647
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:31,081
We're English, Darko.
We leave friendly fire to the Yanks.

648
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:38,263
Hey!

649
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:41,973
Hey. Hey.

650
01:07:54,088 --> 01:07:56,376
Hi. We, erm... We need to...

651
01:07:56,465 --> 01:07:59,038
We need to report a kidnapping
and three murders.

652
01:08:38,922 --> 01:08:41,247
We'll get you up to Inverness
as quick as we can.

653
01:08:41,341 --> 01:08:44,342
Constable Stewart will drive you.
He shouldn't be a minute.

654
01:08:44,427 --> 01:08:47,428
They can take your statements,
give you medical attention.

655
01:08:47,514 --> 01:08:51,511
I'll be just past the kitchen.
So don't worry, I'm not going anywhere.

656
01:08:51,601 --> 01:08:54,056
- You said kitchen.
- Aye.

657
01:08:54,145 --> 01:08:56,268
She could do with something to eat.

658
01:09:13,914 --> 01:09:16,701
- I can't get through to Inverness.
- Why not?

659
01:09:16,792 --> 01:09:19,247
It's a big country.
It all needs policing.

660
01:09:19,336 --> 01:09:21,542
So call another station.

661
01:09:21,671 --> 01:09:26,000
I've left a message. I'm sure the desk
sergeant will call back in a minute.

662
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:31,257
Chocolate cake. My wife's recipe.
I think you might just love it.

663
01:09:50,741 --> 01:09:51,986
You Darko?

664
01:09:53,577 --> 01:09:55,154
Yes.

665
01:09:56,329 --> 01:09:58,203
You got something for me?

666
01:09:59,165 --> 01:10:02,000
- That depends.
- Does it?

667
01:10:03,336 --> 01:10:06,420
I've got the more valuable
merchandise. What have you got?

668
01:10:07,757 --> 01:10:08,955
Money?

669
01:10:12,053 --> 01:10:15,552
There'll always be money in the world,
mate. Plenty of that to go round.

670
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:19,589
But this little girl? Unique.

671
01:10:20,936 --> 01:10:22,596
One of a kind.

672
01:10:23,981 --> 01:10:27,813
- What are you trying to say?
- That we do things my way.

673
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:34,189
You brought the money?

674
01:10:36,451 --> 01:10:37,614
Yeah.

675
01:10:39,829 --> 01:10:42,534
Then this is how we're gonna do it.

676
01:10:42,624 --> 01:10:45,660
I leave here now with the case
and check it with my associates.

677
01:10:45,793 --> 01:10:47,952
All being well and good,

678
01:10:48,046 --> 01:10:52,838
you'll receive a call telling you
where you can find the girl.

679
01:10:57,221 --> 01:10:58,549
No.

680
01:11:02,768 --> 01:11:06,101
- Then I'm gonna leave.
- Go?

681
01:11:06,188 --> 01:11:08,857
You sure?

682
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:12,356
You're not gonna walk out of here
empty handed

683
01:11:12,444 --> 01:11:14,769
without listening to what I have to say.

684
01:11:14,863 --> 01:11:19,987
- I wouldn't fucking bet on that, mate.
- I stake six million euros on it.

685
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:25,619
That's what you've got in the case?

686
01:11:25,706 --> 01:11:30,452
We both know only fools fill cases
with counterfeit money,

687
01:11:30,544 --> 01:11:36,131
fools who don't care to see
their children again. I'm no fool.

688
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:41,922
I'm glad to hear it. Because the same
thing happened to me a few years back.

689
01:11:43,974 --> 01:11:46,844
I took a boy from his family
in Marseilles.

690
01:11:48,895 --> 01:11:51,647
Well, it was a long negotiation
to say the least.

691
01:11:51,731 --> 01:11:54,436
Went on for so long I made a mistake.

692
01:11:58,738 --> 01:12:00,197
I bonded with the boy.

693
01:12:01,741 --> 01:12:03,484
We became close.

694
01:12:07,622 --> 01:12:11,286
He kept saying he wanted to come
and visit me when it was all over.

695
01:12:18,298 --> 01:12:22,213
His parents decided to hand off
a bag full of shredded newspaper.

696
01:12:22,302 --> 01:12:25,469
Police thought they were gonna catch us
during the drop-off.

697
01:12:27,349 --> 01:12:28,926
Oh, no.

698
01:12:33,354 --> 01:12:36,439
I took the boy out in the garden
to play a game of football.

699
01:12:36,524 --> 01:12:38,896
I remember because he went in goal.

700
01:12:40,194 --> 01:12:43,895
When he bent down to pick up the ball,
I shot him in the back of the head.

701
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:47,732
Quick. Painless.

702
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,447
Least I could do.

703
01:12:52,998 --> 01:12:56,201
I buried him somewhere
in the southwest of France.

704
01:12:59,212 --> 01:13:02,083
Parents are still looking for him,
last I heard.

705
01:13:04,509 --> 01:13:05,838
Well done.

706
01:13:08,013 --> 01:13:11,678
Like I said, I'm no fool.

707
01:13:13,309 --> 01:13:14,803
Good.

708
01:13:15,978 --> 01:13:18,220
Because that's a true story.

709
01:13:28,657 --> 01:13:31,528
You see? Nothing to worry about.

710
01:13:32,578 --> 01:13:35,697
- Anyone fancy a cup of tea?
- Tea?

711
01:13:35,789 --> 01:13:38,280
Aye. Nothing like a brew
to set you straight.

712
01:13:38,375 --> 01:13:42,704
No. No, I don't reckon
a brew's gonna do it this time.

713
01:13:42,796 --> 01:13:45,547
You said you were gonna
get us to Inverness.

714
01:13:45,632 --> 01:13:48,039
We wanna get out of here
as quickly as possible.

715
01:13:49,761 --> 01:13:51,753
Understood.

716
01:13:51,888 --> 01:13:55,138
Let me just get on to PC Stewart
and we'll see where he's got to.

717
01:14:02,523 --> 01:14:05,808
- You don't have to be so rude.
- Fuck rude! People are dead.

718
01:14:05,943 --> 01:14:08,979
I wanna get out of this village,
out of this fucking country.

719
01:14:09,071 --> 01:14:11,277
And we will. Relax. We're safe now.

720
01:14:11,365 --> 01:14:14,698
How long's he gonna take?
And where's this other officer?

721
01:14:14,785 --> 01:14:16,694
Sure I can't tempt anyone with a cuppa?

722
01:14:16,787 --> 01:14:19,408
We were supposed to be in a police car
15 minutes ago.

723
01:14:19,498 --> 01:14:21,656
No, thanks! You're being paranoid.

724
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:25,035
Well, did you actually see him
call for help? Did you hear it?

725
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:28,413
- Why haven't they returned his call?
- It's only been ten minutes.

726
01:14:28,506 --> 01:14:30,748
A lot can happen in ten minutes, Alison.

727
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:35,501
Are you ready to trust someone we've
just met after what we've been through?

728
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:40,179
What if he's keeping us busy while he
waits for his mates to finish us off?

729
01:14:45,689 --> 01:14:47,267
Shit!

730
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:51,813
- What do we do?
- We should go.

731
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:57,193
- Let's wait five minutes, see if...
- How much longer do you wanna wait for?

732
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:59,656
Even if he's not in on it,
what good's he gonna do?

733
01:14:59,744 --> 01:15:03,576
What can he protect us from? He's a fat
man with a badge armed with a biro.

734
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:06,749
No, I say we leave now.
We take our chances in the crowd.

735
01:15:10,671 --> 01:15:11,916
OK.

736
01:15:12,006 --> 01:15:14,793
Anna, we're just gonna go for a walk,
sweetheart.

737
01:15:17,595 --> 01:15:20,346
What's going on? Where are you going?

738
01:15:20,431 --> 01:15:21,593
We're just...

739
01:15:21,682 --> 01:15:23,473
- We're leaving.
- It's not safe.

740
01:15:23,559 --> 01:15:26,132
- Well, we're going.
- Absolutely not.

741
01:15:26,228 --> 01:15:29,312
You're my responsibility.
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

742
01:15:29,398 --> 01:15:31,770
You can't keep us here.
If we wanna go, we'll go.

743
01:15:31,858 --> 01:15:35,726
You want to walk out of here? Fine.
But I can't let you take the girl.

744
01:15:37,155 --> 01:15:40,156
I mean it. You leave,
you leave without her.

745
01:15:40,742 --> 01:15:42,200
Ed!

746
01:15:42,952 --> 01:15:46,368
- Don't come any closer.
-  Easy, lad, easy.

747
01:15:46,456 --> 01:15:49,409
Don't do something
you'll have to pay for later.

748
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:54,411
Put the knife down. Right now.

749
01:15:55,589 --> 01:15:57,629
What the...

750
01:16:03,263 --> 01:16:04,378
Get down!

751
01:16:14,024 --> 01:16:16,431
Stay low, stay low. Keep down.

752
01:16:30,373 --> 01:16:32,282
PC Stewart. Come in, over.

753
01:16:33,209 --> 01:16:38,748
Shots fired. I'm under
attack. I need you back at the station.

754
01:16:46,513 --> 01:16:48,304
Get back against the wall!

755
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:53,051
- Hey, hey. Is there a back door?
- Yes. You'll need keys.

756
01:16:53,144 --> 01:16:54,769
- Where?

757
01:17:00,818 --> 01:17:02,277
Follow me.

758
01:17:03,237 --> 01:17:05,029
Down! Get down!

759
01:17:14,331 --> 01:17:15,790
Anna, quick.

760
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:03,960
Now what we have here
is a situation based on trust.

761
01:18:04,045 --> 01:18:06,797
I trust you when you say
that you've brought the money.

762
01:18:08,425 --> 01:18:13,051
And you have to trust me when I say
the girl is safe and somewhere nearby.

763
01:18:14,639 --> 01:18:16,762
I can't even walk into to a newsagent

764
01:18:16,849 --> 01:18:19,471
and buy a pack of cigarettes on trust,
my friend.

765
01:18:20,061 --> 01:18:23,145
Now, if I can't do that,

766
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:26,315
how do you expect me to let 
a man like you

767
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:31,109
walk out of here with a fucking
retirement plan in a briefcase? Hmm?

768
01:18:34,241 --> 01:18:35,901
Man like me?

769
01:18:35,993 --> 01:18:38,828
A kidnapper and a child murderer, yes.

770
01:18:40,747 --> 01:18:42,206
That's a bit personal.

771
01:18:44,042 --> 01:18:48,585
You're a grown man, you can take it.
And this is business.

772
01:18:49,881 --> 01:18:51,957
Like the man in the newsagent.

773
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,004
I hand him the money because I can 
see what I'm buying.

774
01:18:58,097 --> 01:19:01,513
It even comes with a government 
health warning.

775
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:07,187
He gives me what I want
and we both walk away happy.

776
01:19:07,272 --> 01:19:09,016
So, no.

777
01:19:11,235 --> 01:19:13,274
This is not based on trust.

778
01:19:14,321 --> 01:19:17,322
This is based on what I can see 
in front of me.

779
01:19:21,911 --> 01:19:24,070
And you're getting nothing...

780
01:19:25,915 --> 01:19:28,323
...until I see the girl. Nothing.

781
01:19:37,468 --> 01:19:39,092
He's got a gun! Run!

782
01:19:55,443 --> 01:19:56,938
Hurry, hurry.

783
01:19:57,612 --> 01:19:59,023
Fuck!

784
01:20:45,908 --> 01:20:49,692
They don't have the girl.
They don't have the girl!

785
01:20:52,706 --> 01:20:54,082
They've lost the girl.

786
01:20:54,166 --> 01:20:55,791
It's a bluff.

787
01:21:41,712 --> 01:21:43,254
Where are you?

788
01:21:56,017 --> 01:21:57,595
Hey, hey, I love you.

789
01:22:15,619 --> 01:22:17,279
How am I doing, mate?

790
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:25,580
Never mind the bollocks.
Give it me straight.

791
01:22:28,298 --> 01:22:32,165
It's gone straight through the vest
and made a wreck of you. You're dying.

792
01:22:33,052 --> 01:22:35,923
You don't have long
and there's nothing I can do.

793
01:22:36,931 --> 01:22:38,046
Just bad luck, mate.

794
01:22:43,813 --> 01:22:45,011
Gun.

795
01:22:46,315 --> 01:22:47,939
Gun.

796
01:23:27,396 --> 01:23:29,519
Hey! What's going on?

797
01:23:44,537 --> 01:23:45,700
Get down!

798
01:24:23,408 --> 01:24:26,409
You should have just given us the girl!

799
01:24:32,041 --> 01:24:34,911
Where has your compassion
gotten you today?

800
01:24:44,553 --> 01:24:46,261
You fucking bitch!

801
01:25:57,831 --> 01:25:59,290
Hello again.

802
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:34,602
Darko, you're a man of your word.

803
01:29:32,078 --> 01:29:33,786
It's OK.

804
01:29:39,043 --> 01:29:42,328
It's OK, Anna. It's OK.

805
01:29:45,382 --> 01:29:47,209
It's OK.

806
01:30:23,794 --> 01:30:28,005
- What the hell is this?
- This is her father. Now you get paid.

807
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:30,082
If this starts to feel like an ambush,

808
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:32,713
I will take the top
of your fucking head off.

809
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:36,964
- Just so we're clear.
- Stay in the car until I call for you.

810
01:30:37,056 --> 01:30:40,057
- Let me do the talking.
- Don't talk yourself out of a life.

811
01:30:40,143 --> 01:30:41,767
My employer is a businessman.

812
01:30:42,812 --> 01:30:45,018
Last I heard, he was a fucking 
war criminal.

813
01:30:45,106 --> 01:30:46,648
Nice.

814
01:31:48,124 --> 01:31:50,164
500,000.

815
01:31:51,085 --> 01:31:53,125
I can get it for you in an hour.

816
01:31:56,591 --> 01:31:57,919
No?

817
01:31:59,802 --> 01:32:01,960
It was worth a try.

818
01:32:02,972 --> 01:32:06,471
My daughter must have looked like
a good payday to you.

819
01:32:06,559 --> 01:32:08,681
Divorce has made my ex-wife rich.

820
01:32:08,769 --> 01:32:10,892
There is very little she could not afford.

821
01:32:11,605 --> 01:32:15,603
But behind every woman with money
is a man with deep pockets.

822
01:32:15,692 --> 01:32:18,859
You should have concerned yourself
with how he lined them.

823
01:32:20,739 --> 01:32:22,815
Strip that piece of shit.

824
01:32:38,381 --> 01:32:40,872
Darko tells me you lost a man.

825
01:32:41,342 --> 01:32:42,717
That's right.

826
01:32:43,511 --> 01:32:48,172
Don't cry too hard.
Now you won't have to split your fee.

827
01:32:49,683 --> 01:32:51,557
My daughter is safe.

828
01:32:52,394 --> 01:32:54,552
I am in debt to you.

829
01:32:55,313 --> 01:32:57,436
There's a way to fix that.

830
01:32:59,359 --> 01:33:01,482
Your account has already been credited.

831
01:33:03,154 --> 01:33:06,986
You can keep the car. A parting gift.

832
01:33:20,045 --> 01:33:23,461
Put him in the ground. Prepare my tools.

833
01:34:17,809 --> 01:34:19,932
Do you understand what she said?

834
01:34:22,188 --> 01:34:24,560
I think she said "thank you".

835
01:34:40,414 --> 01:34:42,490
Are you alright, sweetheart?

836
01:34:47,045 --> 01:34:48,208
Yeah.

837
01:34:52,133 --> 01:34:59,132
# There'll never be peace
till Jamie comes hame

838
01:35:00,224 --> 01:35:06,263
# The Church is in ruins,
the State is in jars

839
01:35:06,355 --> 01:35:12,393
# Delusions, oppressions
and murderous wars

840
01:35:12,486 --> 01:35:18,109
# We dare na weel say't
but we ken wha's to blame

841
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:24,914
# There'll never be peace
till Jamie comes hame

842
01:35:24,998 --> 01:35:31,001
# My seven braw sons
for Jamie drew sword

843
01:35:31,087 --> 01:35:36,841
# And now I greet round
their green beds in the yerd

844
01:35:36,926 --> 01:35:42,596
# It brak the sweet heart
o' my faithful auld dame

845
01:35:42,682 --> 01:35:49,811
# There'll never be peace
till Jamie comes hame

846
01:35:49,897 --> 01:35:55,769
# Now life is a burden
that bows me down

847
01:35:55,861 --> 01:36:01,733
# Sin' I tint my bairns
and he tint his crown

848
01:36:01,825 --> 01:36:07,697
# But till my last moments
my words are the same

849
01:36:07,789 --> 01:36:15,203
# There'll never be peace
till Jamie comes hame
