0
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,500
Ingenious

2
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:23,287
Yes, now, you
pick out the collar.

3
00:00:23,351 --> 00:00:24,796
You tell me which
one you want.

4
00:00:24,852 --> 00:00:26,225
Which one? Which one?

5
00:00:26,287 --> 00:00:28,062
Yes.

6
00:00:28,122 --> 00:00:31,331
I don't know if there's anything
here I could possibly use.

7
00:00:31,392 --> 00:00:32,029
Mr. Webber?

8
00:00:32,093 --> 00:00:33,037
Yeah.

9
00:00:33,094 --> 00:00:34,232
Matt Reeder,
International Gifts.

10
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:35,968
Oh, right, right.

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,906
Yeah, how are you doing?

12
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:37,943
Good.

13
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:38,909
He's not
talking today.

14
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:40,207
Yeah.

15
00:00:40,268 --> 00:00:42,908
You know, why don't you...
why don't you wait back in the stockroom.

16
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:44,006
Thank you.

17
00:00:44,072 --> 00:00:47,076
Anything with fur?

18
00:00:49,477 --> 00:00:52,587
- Ooh.
- That's gonna' hurt.

19
00:00:52,647 --> 00:00:54,649
Mulligan?

20
00:00:54,716 --> 00:00:59,222
Is he a member?

21
00:01:00,621 --> 00:01:03,295
Shit.

22
00:01:03,358 --> 00:01:07,363
Oops.

23
00:01:07,428 --> 00:01:09,965
I have a question for you.

24
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:12,705
Being an employee here, do you
get to play a lot of golf?

25
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:13,905
Yeah, that's
why I work here.

26
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:14,776
Yeah?

27
00:01:14,836 --> 00:01:15,746
What's your handicap?

28
00:01:15,803 --> 00:01:16,838
Six.

29
00:01:16,904 --> 00:01:18,110
Me, too!

30
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:18,877
No, really?

31
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,418
Yeah.

32
00:01:19,474 --> 00:01:20,817
Well, six-pack.

33
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,116
I'm a really good drinker.

34
00:01:23,177 --> 00:01:24,155
That's corny.

35
00:01:24,212 --> 00:01:27,455
I know, that's terrible.

36
00:01:27,515 --> 00:01:30,838
What do you say we...
we hit some balls sometime?

37
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:32,520
I'll drive the cart around.

38
00:01:32,587 --> 00:01:34,158
I can watch your stroke.

39
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:35,292
Cinda.

40
00:01:35,357 --> 00:01:36,665
Uhh, Preston.

41
00:01:36,724 --> 00:01:37,429
Hi.

42
00:01:37,492 --> 00:01:38,470
How are you, buddy?

43
00:01:38,526 --> 00:01:39,937
You've got a great smile, man.

44
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:41,564
You must have a
good dental planner.

45
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:42,539
Sam Schooler.

46
00:01:42,597 --> 00:01:43,367
How are you?

47
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:44,637
So, what do you got?

48
00:01:44,699 --> 00:01:47,980
Now, the unique feature
of The Dreaming Dog Watch,

49
00:01:48,036 --> 00:01:51,040
Mr. Webber, is the animation.

50
00:01:51,105 --> 00:01:54,348
As the seconds tick by,
you can actually see what the dog

51
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:55,945
is dreaming about.

52
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,011
Huh!

53
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:01,493
I'll be darned!

54
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:02,357
It's clever.

55
00:02:02,417 --> 00:02:02,687
Yeah.

56
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:05,861
And if you look, you'll notice
the... all the animation.

57
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,493
We call it
The Frustrated Golfer's Watch.

58
00:02:09,557 --> 00:02:11,036
And you can see all the
curse symbols after you get

59
00:02:11,092 --> 00:02:12,400
a little back slice.

60
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,302
Slut!

61
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:13,930
You know what I mean?

62
00:02:13,995 --> 00:02:14,769
We've all been there.

63
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:16,137
I know I have.

64
00:02:16,197 --> 00:02:18,199
It's priced right.

65
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:19,973
What rates you got?

66
00:02:20,034 --> 00:02:21,911
n is just the
one for the moment.

67
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:23,073
But we are..

68
00:02:23,137 --> 00:02:25,549
Oh, no, you see, Matt,
my customers would buy this

69
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:27,381
watch like crazy, okay?

70
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:30,013
Provided you had
their dog on it.

71
00:02:30,078 --> 00:02:31,079
Oh, hold on.

72
00:02:31,145 --> 00:02:32,647
Call me crazy,
maybe it's just me,

73
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:34,818
but aren't all your
members golfers?

74
00:02:34,882 --> 00:02:35,860
Uhh, yeah.

75
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:37,157
And they all wear
watches, don't they?

76
00:02:37,218 --> 00:02:38,959
Yeah, just
not novelty watches.

77
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,397
Ahh, gotcha'.

78
00:02:40,455 --> 00:02:42,366
More of a Rolex crowd.

79
00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:44,624
A lady with a Yorkie
is not going to buy a watch,

80
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,164
as cute as it is,
with a Lab on it.

81
00:02:46,227 --> 00:02:47,297
Well, I know
what you mean...

82
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:49,500
You gotta' get
all the breeds, all right?

83
00:02:49,564 --> 00:02:51,566
Yeah, see, I like to follow
give

84
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:54,238
the customer what they want.

85
00:02:54,302 --> 00:02:55,610
You know what I'm saying?

86
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,081
Yeah, I gotta' go.

87
00:02:57,138 --> 00:02:58,082
Careful now.

88
00:02:58,139 --> 00:02:59,948
He jumps.

89
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:01,680
You're going to tell
me that this isn't quality?

90
00:03:01,742 --> 00:03:03,153
That's exactly what I'm saying.

91
00:03:03,211 --> 00:03:05,122
And I'm also saying that you,
you need to pick up

92
00:03:05,179 --> 00:03:08,626
a book on salesmanship.

93
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:12,860
Yeah, well,
I wrote that book, buddy!

94
00:03:15,823 --> 00:03:16,631
Hi.

95
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:18,665
>> Walter,
I see you're still at it.

96
00:03:18,726 --> 00:03:20,205
>> First time I ever
double-crossed the governor.

97
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:22,537
>> What can I do for you?

98
00:03:22,597 --> 00:03:23,940
>> You mind if I sat down?

99
00:03:23,998 --> 00:03:26,077
>> There's been a lamp burning
in the window for you honey,

100
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:27,376
>> go ahead.

101
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:28,539
>> Oh, I jumped out that window
a long time ago...

102
00:03:28,603 --> 00:03:30,480
You can hit your
head against the wall,

103
00:03:30,538 --> 00:03:33,815
try every angle,
rack your brain,

104
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:38,290
and then one day, out of
the blue, you get an idea.

105
00:03:38,346 --> 00:03:40,485
The big idea.

106
00:03:40,548 --> 00:03:43,119
The one you've
been waiting for.

107
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:47,894
A chance to win.

108
00:03:47,955 --> 00:03:49,730
I'm going to go to bed, honey.

109
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:54,205
I've got a six o'clock flight.

110
00:03:54,262 --> 00:04:00,872
Being with Gina made me
want to do anything to win.

111
00:04:55,923 --> 00:04:57,958
- Well, I can appreciate that, sir...
- I'm not here!

112
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,399
...but our accountant
has been super busy.

113
00:05:01,462 --> 00:05:02,668
Mr. Bederman.

114
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,674
Uh-huh.

115
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:05,938
No, he's in a meeting.

116
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,978
Yes, sir.

117
00:05:07,034 --> 00:05:08,012
All right.

118
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:09,446
Matt.

119
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,073
It's here!

120
00:05:11,138 --> 00:05:15,018
Brenda, you get a raise.

121
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:15,577
Sammy!

122
00:05:15,643 --> 00:05:17,020
Huh?

123
00:05:17,078 --> 00:05:19,115
Ooh, is that it?

124
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,682
Yeah, Okay.

125
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:21,658
Where's Brenda?

126
00:05:21,716 --> 00:05:22,194
Brenda?

127
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:22,955
Where's she at?

128
00:05:23,017 --> 00:05:24,155
Hold my calls!

129
00:05:24,218 --> 00:05:24,883
Okay.

130
00:05:26,154 --> 00:05:27,155
Now...

131
00:05:27,156 --> 00:05:28,934
I always wanted to sell a million
of something. Let's see this!

132
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,935
I babied this one.

133
00:05:30,992 --> 00:05:33,993
Calling Hong Kong all night,
faxing diagrams...

134
00:05:33,994 --> 00:05:34,961
- ...back and forth.
- Come on, cut the shit!

135
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:35,428
Let's do this!

136
00:05:35,429 --> 00:05:36,237
Let me see it!

137
00:05:36,297 --> 00:05:42,646
And now, The
Lucky Lottery Watch.

138
00:05:42,703 --> 00:05:43,545
Wow!

139
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:45,845
Lottery Watch?

140
00:05:45,906 --> 00:05:47,180
That's beautiful!

141
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:48,413
Six winning numbers.

142
00:05:48,476 --> 00:05:49,580
Wait, is it
different every time?

143
00:05:49,644 --> 00:05:50,588
Totally random.

144
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:51,953
Wow, It's amazing, man

145
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:54,118
Imagine how many places we're
going to sell that bad boy!

146
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:55,592
First of all, everyone
who sells a lottery ticket.

147
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,325
Chain stores,
department stores.

148
00:05:57,385 --> 00:05:58,688
- Vegas!
- Vegas!

149
00:05:58,753 --> 00:05:59,561
Vegas!

150
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,997
We're going to Vegas!

151
00:06:01,055 --> 00:06:02,728
Excuse me, guys,
but product development is

152
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,133
essentially defining
a need, right?

153
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:05,602
Exactly.

154
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,832
Does someone
playing the lottery

155
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:08,874
really a watch
to pick their numbers?

156
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:10,468
Bean! Bean!

157
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:13,468
This is not a watch.

158
00:06:14,034 --> 00:06:14,808
Nope.

159
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:18,339
We, you and I,
are selling a dream!

160
00:06:18,406 --> 00:06:19,350
That's right, baby.

161
00:06:19,407 --> 00:06:20,408
Hold this, take it.

162
00:06:20,474 --> 00:06:21,509
Sixty million people
play the lottery.

163
00:06:21,575 --> 00:06:23,748
This is a product
that cannot miss.

164
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:26,410
We have a storeroom full of
products that can't miss.

165
00:06:26,412 --> 00:06:27,953
We got the
remote control beer mug.

166
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:28,860
There's thousands of those.

167
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,054
We've got that handbag.

168
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:31,452
Bad ideal.

169
00:06:31,518 --> 00:06:32,526
And the Fish Stories Clock?

170
00:06:32,586 --> 00:06:33,462
Guys!

171
00:06:33,521 --> 00:06:36,462
Whoa, whoa, hey,
Professor Positive.

172
00:06:36,524 --> 00:06:38,834
You didn't even invent that.

173
00:06:38,893 --> 00:06:40,497
Yeah, I like it.

174
00:06:40,561 --> 00:06:41,369
Amazing!

175
00:06:41,429 --> 00:06:42,908
It's good, man.

176
00:06:42,963 --> 00:06:44,374
Let's make a million, huh?

177
00:06:50,938 --> 00:06:52,975
You push this button on
the side of the case

178
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,748
and 6 numbers pop up.

179
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,016
6 numbers.

180
00:06:57,078 --> 00:07:00,855
Different numbers every time.

181
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:03,623
How's he come up
with all these ideas?

182
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:04,890
Well,
believe it or not,

183
00:07:04,952 --> 00:07:08,866
he used to claim it was the
hops, you know, in beer.

184
00:07:08,923 --> 00:07:12,166
Now it's the universal mind.

185
00:07:12,226 --> 00:07:14,103
The universal mind.

186
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:16,732
Their bookkeepers
theory is all ideas come from

187
00:07:16,797 --> 00:07:19,368
some kind of collective
consciousness,

188
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:23,813
one universal mind.

189
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:25,350
OK.

190
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:26,646
I know.

191
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:29,976
But to Matt, you know,
it made perfect sense that

192
00:07:29,977 --> 00:07:33,012
all ideas are floating around
in space like some kind of

193
00:07:33,013 --> 00:07:38,823
old radio and TV broadcast,
and his mind is a receiving station.

194
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:43,860
A receiving station.

195
00:07:43,924 --> 00:07:45,665
I know he's a little off.

196
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:47,262
Yes, but that's
why you liked him.

197
00:07:47,328 --> 00:07:48,238
I know.

198
00:07:48,295 --> 00:07:50,935
That's what I've
always liked about him.

199
00:08:01,018 --> 00:08:03,020
You keep dreaming up the
ideas, buddy, I'll sell them.

200
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:03,656
I will.

201
00:08:03,721 --> 00:08:04,392
That's for sure.

202
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:04,956
You know what I mean?

203
00:08:05,022 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah.

204
00:08:06,057 --> 00:08:08,628
Now, we are going to
need seed money

205
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:11,799
for the new watch.

206
00:08:11,862 --> 00:08:13,705
No, we're not going
to the casino, okay?

207
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:14,708
Read my lips.

208
00:08:14,765 --> 00:08:15,743
We're not going to the casino.

209
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,074
We're not
going to the casino.

210
00:08:17,134 --> 00:08:17,612
That's right.

211
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:19,443
All right.

212
00:08:19,503 --> 00:08:20,413
We're going
to the dog track.

213
00:08:20,471 --> 00:08:22,815
That is the
same difference.

214
00:08:22,873 --> 00:08:23,715
It's a big difference.

215
00:08:23,774 --> 00:08:25,151
It's a dog track,
it's not a casino.

216
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:27,985
And if Gina asks you, "Did
you go to the casino?"

217
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:28,750
And she will!

218
00:08:28,813 --> 00:08:29,757
Fine.

219
00:08:29,814 --> 00:08:32,420
Say no with authority,
because it's true.

220
00:08:32,483 --> 00:08:33,120
It's not the casino.

221
00:08:33,184 --> 00:08:34,663
Say, "No, goddamn it, Gina!

222
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,460
I did not go to
the fucking casino!

223
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,227
I told you I
wouldn't, didn't I?"

224
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:38,699
Yeah.

225
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:39,826
Right?

226
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,994
You gotta' turn it around
On them just like that.

227
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,437
>> It's Bayou by a bundle!

228
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:54,074
Sam loves to
gamble on anything.

229
00:08:54,138 --> 00:08:56,709
"Will the temperature
hit a hundred tomorrow?"

230
00:08:56,774 --> 00:08:59,152
"I bet you I can
eat six jalapenos."

231
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,952
It cost him a lot of
money, and two marriages.

232
00:09:02,013 --> 00:09:03,617
But he shrugs it off.

233
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:04,819
Three or four?

234
00:09:04,882 --> 00:09:09,160
Your dumb dog on that one.

235
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,962
I like it, let's do it.

236
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,660
Whoa.

237
00:09:13,724 --> 00:09:15,362
While we have this
moment, look, look, look!

238
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:16,461
What?

239
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:17,528
See that
dog taking a shit?

240
00:09:17,595 --> 00:09:19,131
Look at him. Look at him.

241
00:09:19,196 --> 00:09:20,072
Yeah?

242
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:20,905
Number 2!

243
00:09:20,965 --> 00:09:21,636
Number 2! Number 2!

244
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:22,803
Our luck is about to change.

245
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:23,777
2... 2... 2.

246
00:09:24,084 --> 00:09:24,892
Can Do!

247
00:09:24,952 --> 00:09:26,192
Can Do!

248
00:09:26,253 --> 00:09:27,493
This is the one, bro!

249
00:09:27,555 --> 00:09:28,761
No, no, man.

250
00:09:28,822 --> 00:09:30,267
Look, he's coming
down from a beating.

251
00:09:30,324 --> 00:09:32,235
Okay, listen to me.

252
00:09:32,293 --> 00:09:35,274
Ahh, a jockey told Carl, the
bartender, that if you see a

253
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:38,572
horse shit before a race,
you bet all you got on him.

254
00:09:38,632 --> 00:09:39,474
He said that.

255
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:41,570
The dog is shitting,
and that's why

256
00:09:41,635 --> 00:09:42,579
you're betting on him?

257
00:09:42,636 --> 00:09:44,309
Yeah. Think about
it. Look at me!

258
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:45,179
He's 22 to 1.

259
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:46,149
Come on, it
makes sense, right?

260
00:09:46,206 --> 00:09:48,618
He's lighter, he's
happy, he's relaxed.

261
00:09:48,676 --> 00:09:49,381
It's horrible!

262
00:09:49,443 --> 00:09:50,421
Think about it.

263
00:09:50,477 --> 00:09:51,683
Let's do this, all right?

264
00:09:51,745 --> 00:09:52,587
Come on, he's a jockey.

265
00:09:52,646 --> 00:09:53,522
Why would he lie?

266
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:54,616
Now, calm down,
let's take it slow.

267
00:09:54,682 --> 00:09:55,683
We just got here, Okay?

268
00:09:55,749 --> 00:09:56,591
Okay, so
how much you got?

269
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,788
I got two $20.

270
00:09:57,851 --> 00:10:01,791
Can I have a 10 dollar
two-four on...,

271
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:03,875
and a 10 dollar 2-8 on...?

272
00:10:03,876 --> 00:10:04,950
Fuck! Great!

273
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:09,733
$400 on 2, Can-Do, to win.

274
00:10:09,797 --> 00:10:11,534
Thank you.

275
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:15,104
I said tickets.

276
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,053
Put away your money.

277
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,713
Here comes the bunny!

278
00:10:17,714 --> 00:10:23,786
And two, let's go, baby!

279
00:10:23,844 --> 00:10:25,255
>> And they're off!

280
00:10:25,313 --> 00:10:29,989
>> ...jump in the lead, followed by
>> Late-For-Dinner and Can-Do!

281
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:32,960
>> They're going
into the first turn!

282
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,297
>> Down in the back stretch.
>> Flea's-Ferrari chases down

283
00:10:36,357 --> 00:10:38,394
>> the number 2 Can-Do.

284
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:44,705
>> Can Do gets passed.
>> As they head for the wire,

285
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:48,178
>> It's Flea's-Ferrari pulling
>> away now by a length!

286
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:53,878
>> Flea's-Ferrari takes it!

287
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:56,615
$400 on the dog shit theory.

288
00:10:56,677 --> 00:11:00,215
You should be proud.

289
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:02,887
Fucking Can-Do bullshit.

290
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,554
I can't blame Sam.

291
00:11:04,618 --> 00:11:07,531
He was just trying to raise
money for our business.

292
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:10,728
Sam did construction for a
while before we teamed up.

293
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,737
Me, I've never had a job.

294
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:14,568
I've always worked for myself.

295
00:11:14,628 --> 00:11:18,906
It can be tough, long hours,
no guaranteed paycheck.

296
00:11:18,966 --> 00:11:21,344
But you have a chance to win.

297
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:22,445
Bye, girl.

298
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:23,474
Bye, sweetie.

299
00:11:23,537 --> 00:11:25,380
Bye, see ya'-

300
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:36,355
So I go out there and the gate
agent ask me for volunteers,

301
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:37,987
you know, to give
up their seats.

302
00:11:38,052 --> 00:11:39,793
Sounded like a game show host.

303
00:11:39,854 --> 00:11:41,561
"A voucher for a
room at the Marriott,

304
00:11:41,622 --> 00:11:44,702
and we'll get you out
on the 7 A.M. non-stop.

305
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,863
Anybody?"

306
00:11:45,926 --> 00:11:48,736
So these two guys sitting
there yell, "Throw her in",

307
00:11:48,796 --> 00:11:50,867
'pointing at me,
"We'll do it."

308
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:54,811
Ahh, smart guys.

309
00:11:54,869 --> 00:11:57,247
So what's new here?

310
00:11:57,304 --> 00:11:58,476
Nothing, really.

311
00:11:58,539 --> 00:12:00,314
Just the same old, same old,
looking after cash flow,

312
00:12:00,374 --> 00:12:03,378
you know.

313
00:12:03,444 --> 00:12:04,855
You guys haven't
been by the casino,

314
00:12:04,912 --> 00:12:06,323
trying to help it, have you?

315
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,324
No.

316
00:12:07,381 --> 00:12:11,591
I, ur,... I told you
I wouldn't, didn't I?

317
00:12:11,652 --> 00:12:14,758
Just asking,
Matt, just asking.

318
00:12:14,822 --> 00:12:17,928
Well, I am
just telling you.

319
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:20,632
Good.

320
00:12:20,694 --> 00:12:22,230
Oh, I can't wait to get
out of this uniform

321
00:12:22,296 --> 00:12:23,604
and take a shower

322
00:12:23,664 --> 00:12:25,200
And I can't
wait for that either.

323
00:12:39,146 --> 00:12:41,353
Oh, guess what
the big rumor is at work.

324
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:43,691
Southwest buying
you out, that one?

325
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:46,357
They're going to be
offering an early retirement.

326
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,956
Retirement?

327
00:12:48,022 --> 00:12:48,966
For you?

328
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,128
You're too young and
sexy to be retired.

329
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:56,484
With a cash incentive,
twenty-some thousand.

330
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:01,035
Twenty thousand?

331
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:02,512
Of course, I can't even
think about it until your

332
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:07,986
business does something,
we pay down our cards.

333
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:10,989
I don't think you'll
be waiting too much longer.

334
00:13:11,045 --> 00:13:13,286
It's like Thomas Edison
said, "To have a great idea,

335
00:13:13,347 --> 00:13:15,452
you've got to have
a lot of them."

336
00:13:15,516 --> 00:13:17,792
Yeah, but while we're
waiting on that light bulb,

337
00:13:17,852 --> 00:13:19,832
we're getting in
deeper and deeper.

338
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:21,127
Come on.

339
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:26,604
Every bad idea I have just
gets us closer, and closer,

340
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:36,445
and closer to a really,
really, really good idea.

341
00:13:36,504 --> 00:13:38,643
Oh, I've got a
really good idea.

342
00:13:38,706 --> 00:13:40,014
I've been
up since six, baby.

343
00:13:40,074 --> 00:13:46,650
I've been up about
a minute and a half.

344
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:20,358
So I said,
"Care for a calzone, sir?"

345
00:14:20,414 --> 00:14:22,758
And he, real
uppity-like goes, "Miss,

346
00:14:22,816 --> 00:14:24,124
you don't know what
you're serving.

347
00:14:24,184 --> 00:14:25,026
I'm Italian.

348
00:14:25,085 --> 00:14:26,826
It's pronounced calzon-e.

349
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:28,560
You emphasize the 'e'.

350
00:14:28,622 --> 00:14:30,863
If you're going to serve it,
learn how to pronounce it."

351
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:33,098
I just moved the
cart on up the aisle.

352
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,504
Yeah, sister...

353
00:14:35,563 --> 00:14:36,803
Exactly.

354
00:14:36,864 --> 00:14:38,434
Then my friend Rita, who's on
the other side of the cart,

355
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:41,742
leans back and says,
"Hey, Gina,

356
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:44,800
would that be
asshole or asshol-e?"

357
00:14:48,842 --> 00:14:52,585
You're not real into it.

358
00:14:52,646 --> 00:14:53,349
Another round?

359
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,222
I'd be really good
after a few of these.

360
00:14:55,652 --> 00:14:57,849
So, I think it's great you
guys have been friends

361
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,824
since high school.

362
00:14:58,886 --> 00:15:00,524
I don't even
know that guy.

363
00:15:00,588 --> 00:15:02,659
I could tell
you some stories.

364
00:15:02,723 --> 00:15:04,202
Please don't say
anything, come on, man.

365
00:15:04,258 --> 00:15:06,295
Gina, you know, she still
thinks I'm a nice guy.

366
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,430
No, I don't

367
00:15:07,494 --> 00:15:09,531
I knew you were an asshole
the minute I met you.

368
00:15:09,597 --> 00:15:10,905
I don't have
to pretend anything.

369
00:15:10,965 --> 00:15:12,035
No, you don't, baby.

370
00:15:12,099 --> 00:15:15,410
No pretending.

371
00:15:24,545 --> 00:15:29,545
I'm really glad
we're all together.

372
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:37,901
So anyways, thank
you, dickhead.

373
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:38,532
Sure, buddy.

374
00:15:38,593 --> 00:15:41,204
G, you know that Cinda's
going to be coming with us

375
00:15:41,261 --> 00:15:42,740
to the expo, you know that?

376
00:15:42,796 --> 00:15:43,797
Oh, really?

377
00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:47,277
Fill out orders,
you know the ropes.

378
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:48,335
That's right.

379
00:15:48,402 --> 00:15:51,178
I don't know the first
thing about the watches.

380
00:15:51,238 --> 00:15:52,979
Babe, you don't have to.

381
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,020
All you got to do is be
a goddess like you are,

382
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:56,145
a big smile.

383
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,382
You know what I mean?

384
00:15:57,444 --> 00:15:58,286
And say, "It's animated!"

385
00:15:58,345 --> 00:16:00,621
It's animated!

386
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:02,126
Not like that
like we practiced.

387
00:16:02,182 --> 00:16:03,252
Like you did it.

388
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:05,490
Hey, excuse me.

389
00:16:05,552 --> 00:16:06,394
You want to win a
million dollars

390
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:09,696
with the touch of a button?

391
00:16:09,757 --> 00:16:10,633
I do..

392
00:16:10,691 --> 00:16:11,465
Push the button.

393
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:12,799
It's animated!

394
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,203
Like that!

395
00:16:14,261 --> 00:16:14,966
I'll buy one, right?

396
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:15,871
Come on!

397
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:16,669
Seriously!

398
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,038
I'll buy three.

399
00:16:18,098 --> 00:16:19,600
I keep telling Gina
when the money rolls in,

400
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:21,510
she's gonna' wonder where
it's been all this time.

401
00:16:21,568 --> 00:16:22,979
When can I
start wondering?

402
00:16:23,037 --> 00:16:24,516
Next week, sister, when
we start selling

403
00:16:24,571 --> 00:16:25,982
a trillion watches.

404
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,711
Really?

405
00:16:26,774 --> 00:16:27,411
That's right.

406
00:16:27,474 --> 00:16:28,782
Quit your goddamn job!

407
00:16:28,842 --> 00:16:30,150
Yeah, I'm
gonna' quit, okay?

408
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,245
Sam says I can.

409
00:16:31,311 --> 00:16:32,813
Can do, sister!

410
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,154
YOU can do it.

411
00:16:34,214 --> 00:16:35,249
Can Do.

412
00:16:35,315 --> 00:16:38,592
Can Do, the dog.

413
00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:42,429
What dog?

414
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:44,992
Dog?

415
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:49,405
We were selling
the dog watches.

416
00:16:49,463 --> 00:16:51,875
Am I missing something?

417
00:16:51,932 --> 00:16:53,879
Have you heard
Sam's dog shit theory?

418
00:16:55,283 --> 00:16:56,234
Look, what kind...

419
00:16:56,235 --> 00:16:57,447
We're eating, no one
wants to hear about it.

420
00:16:57,504 --> 00:16:58,482
No, no,
it's hilarious.

421
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:00,849
They were at the dog
track last week...

422
00:17:00,908 --> 00:17:03,582
Hey,

423
00:17:03,644 --> 00:17:05,248
You were
at the dog track?

424
00:17:05,312 --> 00:17:06,518
Did you go?

425
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,025
No, I went.

426
00:17:08,082 --> 00:17:09,254
You didn't go.

427
00:17:09,316 --> 00:17:13,162
I went with Bartender Carl,
and dominated, by the way.

428
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,291
Salsa?

429
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:20,896
It's delicious.

430
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:24,773
G?

431
00:17:34,742 --> 00:17:36,619
That's great.

432
00:17:36,677 --> 00:17:37,781
I'm really
sorry, honey.

433
00:17:37,845 --> 00:17:39,153
No, it's my fault.

434
00:17:46,553 --> 00:17:49,557
Gina.

435
00:17:49,623 --> 00:17:53,264
How stupid can I be?

436
00:17:53,327 --> 00:17:58,299
I'm picking up extra trips to
pay down our credit cards,

437
00:17:58,365 --> 00:17:59,503
and you're here gambling.

438
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:00,670
I know, I know.

439
00:18:00,734 --> 00:18:02,236
It isn't fair.

440
00:18:02,302 --> 00:18:06,808
Listen, we were just trying
to get more money

441
00:18:06,874 --> 00:18:07,944
so we could fund...

442
00:18:08,008 --> 00:18:09,214
If I hear that
excuse one more time,

443
00:18:09,276 --> 00:18:10,584
I'm gonna' scream.

444
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:13,090
I'm gonna'
quit for good.

445
00:18:13,147 --> 00:18:15,127
You said
that two weeks ago,

446
00:18:15,182 --> 00:18:20,222
and a couple of months before
that, and a year before that.

447
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,793
It's getting to be a joke.

448
00:18:30,097 --> 00:18:33,340
Gina, listen.

449
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,778
The way we figure it, sixty
million people

450
00:18:35,836 --> 00:18:37,782
play the lottery.

451
00:18:37,838 --> 00:18:39,442
If I can sell one
percent, I mean,

452
00:18:39,506 --> 00:18:44,285
that is one out of a hundred,
that's sixty thousand watches!

453
00:18:44,344 --> 00:18:47,518
That's you taking
early retirement.

454
00:18:47,581 --> 00:18:49,288
That's a down
payment on our house.

455
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:50,327
That's...

456
00:18:50,384 --> 00:18:53,331
I hope it's a
huge hit, I really do.

457
00:18:53,387 --> 00:18:58,359
But if you ever
gamble again...

458
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:19,184
Don't blame Cinda, man.

459
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,017
Blame me.

460
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,182
I do blame you.

461
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,055
I swore I told
her not to say anything.

462
00:19:25,115 --> 00:19:29,825
Yeah, just don't
worry about it, man.

463
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:35,495
So was it a long ride
to the airport this morning?

464
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:37,538
Yeah, the old
silent treatment

465
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,824
I used to look forward
to those with Rhonda,

466
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:40,721
actually instigate them.

467
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,690
You think I talk a lot, man?

468
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:43,000
Jesus..

469
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:47,691
Gina giving you a hard time
about having to fly so much?

470
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,733
I wouldn't
blame her if she did.

471
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,235
Withholding sex yet?

472
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,269
No.

473
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:54,805
It's the only entertainment
we can afford.

474
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:55,931
But you know what? That's
a good thing, buddy,

475
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,338
because that's the
last thing to go.

476
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,807
Oh Rhonda, towards the end
of that train wreck of a

477
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,838
marriage, she'd
tell me, "Sam, no!

478
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,704
I'm mid-month.

479
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:02,541
I'm bloated.

480
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:03,444
I don't want you
to look at me."

481
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:04,038
I don't want to look at you!

482
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:05,741
I want to fuck you!

483
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,216
What a psycho, man.

484
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:08,343
Right?

485
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,784
Rhonda.

486
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,753
Liar's Poker for the tab.

487
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:14,655
Oh, well, can't very
well turn down free beer,

488
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:15,818
can I?

489
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,225
Hey, fuck you, man.

490
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:18,819
Loser's first.

491
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:19,761
Okay, I'll go anyway.

492
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:23,926
Yeah.

493
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,264
Three fours, my friend.

494
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,268
Yeah?

495
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,133
That's not going to do it.

496
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,605
Four sixes.

497
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:32,734
Oh, it's there, don't worry.

498
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,004
Five sixes.

499
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,174
Good God,
you're terrible!

500
00:20:35,175 --> 00:20:36,541
Keep it, keep it,
keep it!

501
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:38,140
God, I don't like
this stupid game!

502
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:39,081
Who made that up anyway?

503
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:40,913
Hey, Carl!

504
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,075
Two morons, Sammy.

505
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:42,247
Yeah.

506
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:48,486
The thing is, America
is the place where a little

507
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:50,550
guy can have a big idea.

508
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,495
Anybody can do it, come
up with bubble wrap,

509
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,897
a super soaker,
a lottery watch.

510
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:56,933
A million dollars

511
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,832
You gotta' see in

512
00:20:58,891 --> 00:20:59,801
It's animated!

513
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,896
One idea can
change everything.

514
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,634
All it takes is one.

515
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,300
Check it out.

516
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,707
It's gonna' change every time.

517
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,439
How do you feel about
winning some cash?

518
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,377
I feel good about it.

519
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,413
Let's do this, all right?

520
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,038
Come on.

521
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,480
All right.

522
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:13,539
Check it out.

523
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:17,452
Check out this
great new watch.

524
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,887
Hey, how are
you doing, buddy?

525
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,288
Lucky Lottery Watch, how
do you feel about it?

526
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:20,915
No?

527
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,186
Come on now.

528
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:23,818
Hey, I know
you like the lottery.

529
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,590
Check it out, a new way
to play the lottery!

530
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,494
oh, yeah.

531
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:28,395
More than two shakes,
you're playing with it.

532
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,990
You know what I'm saying?

533
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:31,126
I've got the
dress, I've got the smile.

534
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,168
It's animated.

535
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:32,793
I need a drink.

536
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:33,563
It's animated.

537
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:34,468
It's not working.

538
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,268
Tell me about it.

539
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,597
What is this, kid?

540
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:39,833
What is this?

541
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,401
Is this a Lab, or
is this a Retriever?

542
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,343
That is a Lab.

543
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,846
It's one of our best sellers.

544
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,780
It's cute, very cute.

545
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:47,943
Listen, who makes the business
decisions for this company?

546
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:48,708
That would be me.

547
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:50,349
Matt Reeder.

548
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,114
Hey,
Matt, how are you?

549
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:52,019
How can I help you?

550
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:53,022
Oh, no, no.

551
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,685
The question is,
how can I help you?

552
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,091
See, my company is the leader

553
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,095
in TV direct response
advertising.

554
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,687
What we'd like to
do is stop by...

555
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,198
We're not doing any
advertising right now.

556
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,824
Wait, wait, wait.

557
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,300
It's a whole new concept.

558
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:06,393
We pay you.

559
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,700
Okay, we're
really busy here, so...

560
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:09,535
Listen, I
picked up a brochure,

561
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:10,300
so I'll give you a call later.

562
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:11,865
I'll explain what we do, okay?

563
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,205
Come to the office
and we'll talk.

564
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:16,405
We're really
not interested.

565
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:19,541
You're not
interested in making money?

566
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:22,245
Listen, I'll give you a call.

567
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:24,652
I think you'll like what
I have to say, okay?

568
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,020
Maybe I can get you
some customers, right?

569
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,956
Huh?

570
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,688
Customers are nice.

571
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,094
Nice to see you.

572
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:36,326
Fucking queer.

573
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:39,598
Who's that asshole?

574
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:52,039
You know, I mean, I
wouldn't call it a dud.

575
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,777
I'd call it a start.

576
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,342
Sam, use
some common sense.

577
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:58,650
I mean, look, I'm as
disappointed as you are.

578
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,089
That's fine.

579
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:02,558
Hey, look, maybe that's
the problem, buddy.

580
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,288
I don't know, maybe there's
just too much fucking common

581
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,328
sense around here!

582
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,364
Let's, I don't know,
shake it up a little bit!

583
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,229
Let's think outside the box!

584
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:11,857
OK.

585
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:14,227
All right, I got it.

586
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:15,271
Here's one.

587
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,965
Get a little publicity.

588
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,066
Find a lucky lottery winner,
and say we pay him a couple

589
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:22,135
grand, I don't know, to say
that they got their numbers

590
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:23,373
off of our watch.

591
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:24,710
They go on TV.

592
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,647
They say to the entire world,

593
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:29,550
'I got the numbers off of this
watch'

594
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,610
Sam, will you
listen to yourself.

595
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:33,452
They just won the lottery.

596
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,490
Why are they going to lie for
us for

597
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:36,686
a couple of thousand bucks?

598
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,092
I don't know, man.

599
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,322
I'm just throwing
it out there.

600
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:40,955
And that's assuming we have a
couple of thousand bucks.

601
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,431
Yeah, we're
delinquent on everything,

602
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:44,331
and withholding is right
around the corner.

603
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,596
Okay, here we
go, small thinker.

604
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:47,365
What?

605
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,302
Underachiever.

606
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,430
Okay, we gotta'
figure this out,

607
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,406
unless you want to be
pounding nails again.

608
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:52,670
All right, well, I'm the
only one coming up with some

609
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:53,710
ideas.

610
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:54,767
Anyone else want
to chime in here?

611
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:56,074
Here's an idea.

612
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:58,172
We could've done four or five
breeds of the dog watch for

613
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:00,547
what we wasted at that expo!

614
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:01,983
But we didn't,
did we, Bean?

615
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,247
The highest re-order
rate of any product

616
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:04,413
we've ever had, ever

617
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:06,013
You know what, I want to
fucking choke you sometimes!

618
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,216
Jesus!

619
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,883
Goddammit, Bean, you're really
starting to piss me off!

620
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:12,122
Hey, hey, you are
starting to piss me off, okay?

621
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,790
Fuck!

622
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:17,460
Come on, amigo.

623
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:18,900
Hey, hey, hey, man.

624
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,417
Come on, come on.

625
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:33,183
Okay, let's go see
the bank manager.

626
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:34,616
With Our
financial statement?

627
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,277
Don't be ridiculous.

628
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:37,980
No, we'll just go to him
without all the negative shit

629
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,249
On it.

630
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,518
I hope you're kidding,
because that's bank fraud!

631
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,184
I can never tell
with you anymore.

632
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:44,626
Yes, Bean,
he's kidding.

633
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,924
Because
I won't sign it!

634
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,897
Bean, he's kidding.

635
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:49,839
Bean!

636
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:59,001
Look, we're on
the same team, right?

637
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:04,742
I need you, man.

638
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:08,843
I say whatever it takes.

639
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:12,048
I don't know what that is.

640
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,130
Whatever it takes.

641
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,995
Sam and I are
essentially out of business.

642
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:24,125
I didn't know
it was that bad.

643
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,466
I mean, we got enough
money for one maybe two

644
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,335
payrolls, and that's it.

645
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,432
You know, maybe
it's for the best.

646
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:34,171
Go to work for Louisa, and get
away from Sam and his schemes

647
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:36,645
before you end up in jail.

648
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,409
I kind of like you, I
don't want you in jail.

649
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,711
Well, you know, a
problem is

650
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:42,411
an opportunity in disguise.

651
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:46,752
I mean, every store who buys
the dog watch sells out.

652
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:52,524
We just need more breeds.

653
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:58,052
Could you get a loan
from your credit union?

654
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:04,967
No, Mam

655
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,099
No!

656
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:14,985
Gina...

657
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,575
No, Matt!

658
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:17,143
No!

659
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,415
I mean, how many failed
products have you had lately?

660
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,286
That stupid jogger TV hat
I tried to talk you out of?

661
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:23,418
Watch TV while you jog?

662
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:26,361
The ten second toothbrush
for people in a hurry?

663
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,226
Come on, Matt!

664
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:28,287
Yeah, that was stupid

665
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:29,526
but this is completely
different.

666
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,623
It is night and day.

667
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:34,193
Every store that bought
the dog watch sold out!

668
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,797
I need more breeds
to get more accounts.

669
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:40,105
Gina, this can work, trust me.

670
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:43,339
This can work.

671
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,814
Say it doesn't
sell for any reason.

672
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:49,580
Would you promise to
go to work for Louisa?

673
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:51,349
Look, it's
a proven product.

674
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,514
We've sold these!

675
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:55,024
Just answer
the question, Matt.

676
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,993
Say it doesn't sell, would
you go to work for Louisa?

677
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,495
Look, you ever hear
about what happens to pro

678
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,428
athletes when they sign
their first contract?

679
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:02,625
What's that got
to do with anything?

680
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:05,222
Suddenly, here comes
the family with their hands out

681
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:05,902
"Gimme, gimme".

682
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,062
I mean, that's how I'm
going to feel

683
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,605
working for your sister.

684
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:11,665
Well,
you'd get over it!

685
00:27:12,972 --> 00:27:14,542
Al, I'm a
happily married woman.

686
00:27:14,607 --> 00:27:17,884
No, no, no.

687
00:27:17,943 --> 00:27:19,820
Just what I needed,
another success seminar

688
00:27:19,879 --> 00:27:22,291
with my in-laws.

689
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:25,454
A guy in a bar told me once,
if you want to know what God

690
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:29,557
thinks about money, look
at who he gives it to.

691
00:27:29,622 --> 00:27:31,295
Al, I love
you, you know that.

692
00:27:31,357 --> 00:27:32,461
I'd do anything for you.

693
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:33,283
Absolutely.

694
00:27:33,593 --> 00:27:34,469
Matt, another beer?

695
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,227
Okay, sure.

696
00:27:35,228 --> 00:27:36,799
But first, get
me that signature, Okay?

697
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,861
Al, stop flirting with my wife.
We get guests.

698
00:27:37,862 --> 00:27:39,340
Get me that signature today.

699
00:27:39,397 --> 00:27:39,500
OK.

700
00:27:40,082 --> 00:27:40,474
Chao.

701
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,276
Oh, God,
I need a drink.

702
00:27:42,634 --> 00:27:42,944
Now, now, now!

703
00:27:42,945 --> 00:27:43,269
Coming right up.

704
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:43,746
I've got one ready.

705
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,778
I'm so sorry
I'm so late.

706
00:27:45,838 --> 00:27:48,250
So sorry.

707
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:50,013
Here you go, my love.

708
00:27:50,075 --> 00:27:53,215
Oh, thank you.

709
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:55,519
What do you think?

710
00:27:55,581 --> 00:27:58,824
Thank you,
you wonderful man.

711
00:27:58,884 --> 00:27:59,274
Go get 'em.

712
00:27:59,275 --> 00:27:59,939
I'm good.

713
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,497
I'm good.

714
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,227
So, it's so
good to see you guys.

715
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:04,290
You are good.

716
00:28:04,356 --> 00:28:05,334
So, Matt,
what do you want? Medium rare?

717
00:28:05,391 --> 00:28:06,062
Did you get
my message last week?

718
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,095
I was in
Boise and Sacramento.

719
00:28:08,161 --> 00:28:10,368
Oh, world traveler.

720
00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:11,635
Well, guess what.

721
00:28:11,697 --> 00:28:14,871
The week before Christmas,
you two are coming with us

722
00:28:14,934 --> 00:28:15,776
to Telluride.

723
00:28:17,335 --> 00:28:18,137
Telluride.

724
00:28:18,203 --> 00:28:18,977
Yeah.

725
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:20,039
We won the winning donation.

726
00:28:20,105 --> 00:28:21,982
At the Lupus
Charity Auction.

727
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:23,486
Fourteen grand, huh?

728
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:25,044
For a disease,
don't know

729
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,646
what the hell it is.

730
00:28:26,712 --> 00:28:29,056
But it got us a four bedroom
condo right on the slopes

731
00:28:29,114 --> 00:28:30,286
for a week.

732
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:32,727
Yeah, you ski right in,
ski right out your front door.

733
00:28:32,785 --> 00:28:36,892
We thought of you guys the
second we got it, huh?

734
00:28:36,955 --> 00:28:38,434
Well?

735
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,527
There's no way we can
afford Telluride for a week.

736
00:28:40,592 --> 00:28:41,400
Oh, come on!

737
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,495
It's all paid fort

738
00:28:42,561 --> 00:28:43,539
Yeah, but the
skiing, the restaurants...

739
00:28:43,595 --> 00:28:44,573
Oh!

740
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,303
Live a little, have
some fun for a change.

741
00:28:46,365 --> 00:28:48,936
You guys have got to stop
worrying about money.

742
00:28:49,001 --> 00:28:50,947
So how's business?

743
00:28:51,003 --> 00:28:53,347
Could be better,
you know.

744
00:28:53,405 --> 00:28:55,248
I have an office and a
desk could have

745
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:56,547
your name on it.

746
00:28:56,608 --> 00:28:57,882
I mean, anytime you
want, no pressure.

747
00:28:57,943 --> 00:29:00,924
There is a hot rock
massage that'll make you wet,

748
00:29:00,979 --> 00:29:02,481
and I don't mean sweat

749
00:29:02,548 --> 00:29:05,427
What do you think?

750
00:29:05,484 --> 00:29:07,327
Oh, seriously, Matt.

751
00:29:07,386 --> 00:29:09,366
Do you know what we
call real estate?

752
00:29:09,421 --> 00:29:12,800
Steal estate!

753
00:29:12,858 --> 00:29:16,237
Stop throwing
your money away on rent.

754
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:18,366
Yeah, you can get my
little sister the casita

755
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:24,176
she's always wanted.

756
00:29:24,236 --> 00:29:26,648
A little more wine?

757
00:29:26,705 --> 00:29:27,342
You too, hun?

758
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:30,046
No, no, I'm good.

759
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:31,452
Seven thousand,
that's amazing!

760
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:35,117
Her credit union has a
formula based on her salary.

761
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,818
Just be glad she got
the loan she did.

762
00:29:36,882 --> 00:29:39,761
But seven grand,
that's...no, that's amazing.

763
00:29:39,818 --> 00:29:41,491
Never mind, I should shut up.

764
00:29:41,553 --> 00:29:43,726
You know, it's three
more breeds, right?

765
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:45,393
We have the Lab.

766
00:29:45,457 --> 00:29:46,800
We should do the Retriever,
the German Shepherd

767
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:47,769
and the Beagle.

768
00:29:47,826 --> 00:29:49,169
It's better
than one Lab.

769
00:29:49,228 --> 00:29:50,468
But not really, man.

770
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:52,372
I mean, everybody I talk to
wants the top ten or nothing,

771
00:29:52,431 --> 00:29:53,466
right?

772
00:29:53,532 --> 00:29:54,476
They don't want to piss
off the Boxer people,

773
00:29:54,533 --> 00:29:55,511
the Poodle people, blah, blah.

774
00:29:55,567 --> 00:29:56,011
I know.

775
00:29:56,068 --> 00:29:59,248
Look, just be
satisfied, all right?

776
00:30:00,104 --> 00:30:01,024
It's a good thing.

777
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,218
You know
what we're good at?

778
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:10,817
Lately not a whole lot.

779
00:30:10,883 --> 00:30:12,794
A little bit
of BJ my friend.

780
00:30:12,851 --> 00:30:14,262
Now, let's head to
that reservation.

781
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,798
No, listen.

782
00:30:15,854 --> 00:30:16,730
Oh, come on,
you are a real asshole.

783
00:30:16,788 --> 00:30:17,823
No, listen to
me, listen to me.

784
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,563
Okay, look, we want to
do 3 breeds, right?

785
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:22,572
That's $1900 each,
that's $5700.

786
00:30:22,628 --> 00:30:25,165
We have $1300 left
to play with, right?

787
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,573
Now, we hit a few
hands we have.

788
00:30:26,632 --> 00:30:27,702
What is this and this?

789
00:30:27,766 --> 00:30:30,178
That's a stack o' black, Okay?

790
00:30:30,235 --> 00:30:32,078
You pull that in, what
do we got here, cowboy?

791
00:30:32,137 --> 00:30:33,047
That's a nest egg!

792
00:30:33,105 --> 00:30:34,550
That's 12 grand!

793
00:30:34,606 --> 00:30:36,552
That's the top 10
breeds, my friend!

794
00:30:36,608 --> 00:30:40,055
That is the difference between
walking out of a store with an

795
00:30:40,112 --> 00:30:41,182
order for 10 dozen
instead of...

796
00:30:41,246 --> 00:30:42,350
3 dozen.

797
00:30:42,414 --> 00:30:43,984
But Gina, she gave us that
money, all of that money,

798
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:45,323
for watches.

799
00:30:45,384 --> 00:30:47,295
Yes, but she would want
us to protect this investment,

800
00:30:47,352 --> 00:30:48,524
wouldn't she?

801
00:30:48,587 --> 00:30:49,725
Okay, look at it this way.

802
00:30:49,788 --> 00:30:51,392
We lose that $1300,
which we won't,

803
00:30:51,456 --> 00:30:52,526
because we dominate.

804
00:30:52,591 --> 00:30:53,797
Say we do.

805
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:56,627
We still have the
$5700 left to do

806
00:30:56,628 --> 00:30:58,972
the top 3 breeds.

807
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:00,408
We do dominate
at blackjack.

808
00:31:00,465 --> 00:31:05,778
Yes, We do.

809
00:31:05,837 --> 00:31:06,372
Lift Off.

810
00:31:06,438 --> 00:31:09,419
Yes, We can.

811
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:23,056
Goddamn!

812
00:31:23,121 --> 00:31:24,964
Get my man some
French caviar, hun.

813
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:37,738
Here we go again!

814
00:31:37,803 --> 00:31:38,577
I'm not afraid.

815
00:31:38,637 --> 00:31:42,380
I ain't afraid.

816
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:43,647
8.

817
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:45,313
We got to.

818
00:31:45,377 --> 00:31:48,256
Do the math!

819
00:31:48,313 --> 00:31:50,987
Oh, it's
gonna' be good.

820
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:53,552
Do it again?

821
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:54,563
Twenty-four thousand!

822
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,158
Oh, do it again!

823
00:31:58,223 --> 00:32:00,396
Do it again!

824
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:01,301
Put it all in, baby!

825
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,236
We're all good!

826
00:32:02,294 --> 00:32:03,500
All right,
he's got a Six!

827
00:32:03,562 --> 00:32:06,975
Unbelievable!

828
00:32:31,323 --> 00:32:33,701
Seven thousand dollars.

829
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:35,466
Dealer's sitting on
a 16, hits a 5?

830
00:32:35,527 --> 00:32:40,272
It's unbelievable!

831
00:32:43,335 --> 00:32:47,283
What happened?

832
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:48,181
We out of gas?

833
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,741
What?

834
00:32:48,807 --> 00:32:49,615
I can't go home.

835
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:54,215
What?

836
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:59,279
Not until
I figure this out.

837
00:33:07,426 --> 00:33:12,899
All right.

838
00:33:14,499 --> 00:33:16,501
Insurance fire.

839
00:33:16,568 --> 00:33:17,410
Insurance fire!

840
00:33:17,469 --> 00:33:19,380
Let's just torch
all of our watches.

841
00:33:19,438 --> 00:33:20,712
Is that so wrong?

842
00:33:20,772 --> 00:33:22,217
It's win-win!

843
00:33:22,274 --> 00:33:24,015
Newkin.

844
00:33:24,076 --> 00:33:24,816
New what?

845
00:33:24,876 --> 00:33:25,411
Who?

846
00:33:25,477 --> 00:33:26,455
Newkin.

847
00:33:26,511 --> 00:33:27,683
The guy, do you remember?

848
00:33:27,746 --> 00:33:30,226
The guy from the booth, said
he'd put the watches on TV

849
00:33:30,282 --> 00:33:31,920
and give us a percentage.

850
00:33:31,983 --> 00:33:33,223
Oh no, man.

851
00:33:33,285 --> 00:33:33,854
The knock-off king?

852
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:34,795
No.

853
00:33:34,853 --> 00:33:36,093
What do you mean,
the knock-off king?

854
00:33:36,154 --> 00:33:37,758
Yeah, man, all the guys
in the next booth said that

855
00:33:37,823 --> 00:33:40,201
that guy lurches around
all the trade shows to rip

856
00:33:40,258 --> 00:33:41,532
people's ideas off.

857
00:33:41,593 --> 00:33:42,094
Forget in

858
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,661
Fuck him!

859
00:33:42,728 --> 00:33:43,263
No.

860
00:33:43,328 --> 00:33:44,272
I doubt it.

861
00:33:44,329 --> 00:33:46,275
The guy runs a huge company.

862
00:33:46,331 --> 00:33:49,175
He's got ads on major
cable all the time.

863
00:33:49,234 --> 00:33:51,771
God, imagine how
many he could sell.

864
00:33:51,837 --> 00:33:53,817
Sixty-four million dog owners.

865
00:33:53,872 --> 00:33:55,874
Remember Bean's stat, 4 out
of 5 of them write their

866
00:33:55,941 --> 00:33:58,012
pet's names on greeting cards.

867
00:33:58,076 --> 00:33:59,851
Newkin can reach those people.

868
00:33:59,911 --> 00:34:00,912
You know what, buddy?

869
00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:02,151
That's the reason why we
should do it on our own,

870
00:34:02,214 --> 00:34:03,318
you know what I mean?

871
00:34:03,382 --> 00:34:04,861
Why turn it over to some
cheese dick and end up with

872
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:06,361
nothing, man, and
get railroaded?

873
00:34:06,418 --> 00:34:10,025
No way!

874
00:34:10,088 --> 00:34:11,931
I don't trust a guy that
can eat his own fist, okay?

875
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:12,798
Call me crazy!

876
00:34:12,858 --> 00:34:14,496
You see the chompers
on that guy?

877
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:15,560
Come on, man.

878
00:34:15,627 --> 00:34:16,901
You want to do business
with him, seriously?

879
00:34:16,962 --> 00:34:18,771
I'd like to
do business, Sam.

880
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,935
That's what I'd like IO do.

881
00:34:24,669 --> 00:34:25,977
You boys are old
enough to remember this.

882
00:34:26,037 --> 00:34:29,280
This is one of the all
time TV products.

883
00:34:29,341 --> 00:34:30,649
The chirping bird clock.

884
00:34:30,709 --> 00:34:33,246
How many of those
did you sell, if I can ask?

885
00:34:33,311 --> 00:34:34,346
Oh, Jesus.

886
00:34:34,413 --> 00:34:36,154
Mort?

887
00:34:36,214 --> 00:34:43,098
We sold... 781,260 clocks
in 105 days.

888
00:34:43,155 --> 00:34:46,500
But wait, there's more!

889
00:34:46,558 --> 00:34:48,094
I love those
commercials, the guy...

890
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,468
Yeah, we're
very proud of that.

891
00:34:49,528 --> 00:34:51,303
Now, those numbers
are just a start,

892
00:34:51,363 --> 00:34:53,468
because once you create
interest in a product on TV

893
00:34:53,532 --> 00:34:56,479
then you go
for the after market.

894
00:34:56,535 --> 00:34:59,141
Retail.

895
00:34:59,204 --> 00:35:02,549
We're sitting at the adult table
with Sears and Wal-Mart.

896
00:35:02,607 --> 00:35:05,110
At the adult table,
Matthew, do you hear that?

897
00:35:05,177 --> 00:35:07,714
With Sears and Wal-Mart.

898
00:35:07,779 --> 00:35:09,122
if I may,

899
00:35:14,085 --> 00:35:16,463
You see, it's animated, so you
can actually see

900
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:18,091
what dogs dream about.

901
00:35:23,895 --> 00:35:26,535
Millions of dog
lovers out there, Larry.

902
00:35:26,598 --> 00:35:29,135
Our customer,
too, older female.

903
00:35:29,201 --> 00:35:30,475
QVC?

904
00:35:30,535 --> 00:35:32,310
Come on, you get some has-been
celebrity on there with their

905
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,179
pet Corgi or something.

906
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:37,379
Could have a big upside.

907
00:35:37,442 --> 00:35:38,614
How many
breeds you got?

908
00:35:38,677 --> 00:35:40,054
Well, right now
it is just the one,

909
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:43,991
but when we partner
with AmeriDirect,

910
00:35:44,049 --> 00:35:47,292
the American Kennel Club
top 20.

911
00:35:47,352 --> 00:35:49,059
All right.

912
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,294
If we pick you up, we
fund all the TV ads.

913
00:35:52,357 --> 00:35:54,428
We handle inventory
management,

914
00:35:54,493 --> 00:35:55,767
retail distribution.

915
00:35:55,827 --> 00:35:56,771
All right.

916
00:35:56,828 --> 00:35:57,397
OK.

917
00:35:57,462 --> 00:35:58,907
So, question, yeah.

918
00:35:58,964 --> 00:36:00,409
What's our cut?

919
00:36:00,465 --> 00:36:04,003
If we pick you up,
an untested product,

920
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:06,447
4%.

921
00:36:08,505 --> 00:36:09,952
How about a little
dinner before you fuck me?

922
00:36:10,008 --> 00:36:11,681
Wow!

923
00:36:11,743 --> 00:36:12,517
Amazing!

924
00:36:12,577 --> 00:36:13,647
Untested product?

925
00:36:13,712 --> 00:36:15,282
Do you know how many of
those watches we've sold?

926
00:36:15,347 --> 00:36:18,055
How many
have you sold on TV?

927
00:36:18,116 --> 00:36:19,896
Our volume is 50,

928
00:36:19,952 --> 00:36:22,393
100 times anything
you can possibly produce,

929
00:36:22,454 --> 00:36:24,592
especially with your
limited financial capability.

930
00:36:24,656 --> 00:36:25,532
Oh, really?

931
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,591
And how do you know
anything about our

932
00:36:26,658 --> 00:36:27,898
limited financial capability?

933
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:29,836
We vetted
International Gifts.

934
00:36:29,894 --> 00:36:30,464
What?

935
00:36:30,529 --> 00:36:31,239
What happened?

936
00:36:31,296 --> 00:36:31,756
We checked you out.

937
00:36:31,764 --> 00:36:33,367
What, I'm gonna' sit across
this table from two people I

938
00:36:33,431 --> 00:36:34,474
don't know shit about?

939
00:36:34,533 --> 00:36:35,538
What am I, stupid, huh?

940
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,169
That's debatable.

941
00:36:36,234 --> 00:36:37,042
I don't know.

942
00:36:37,102 --> 00:36:38,604
Well, you
guys have no money.

943
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,944
Why did you come
to see me, huh?

944
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:41,780
Why are you sitting
in that chair, huh?

945
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,716
You answer me that!

946
00:36:42,774 --> 00:36:43,775
You know, I...

947
00:36:43,842 --> 00:36:45,877
I what?
I...I...I what?

948
00:36:45,944 --> 00:36:47,048
Why did you come to see me?

949
00:36:47,112 --> 00:36:49,592
You tell him, tell
him why you came.

950
00:36:49,648 --> 00:36:52,288
Tell your little snot-nosed
friend why you came.

951
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,626
Because I can move
your merchandise.

952
00:36:54,686 --> 00:36:56,131
Well, that's
because you're the king.

953
00:36:56,187 --> 00:36:57,427
I am the king.

954
00:36:57,489 --> 00:36:58,490
You are the
knock-off king!

955
00:36:58,557 --> 00:37:01,197
All right young man,
that's enough.

956
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:03,205
That's all.

957
00:37:03,261 --> 00:37:04,740
Not smart.

958
00:37:04,796 --> 00:37:07,538
You boys are out
of your league.

959
00:37:10,101 --> 00:37:13,048
What a goddamn prick!

960
00:37:13,104 --> 00:37:13,878
You're the prick.

961
00:37:13,939 --> 00:37:14,417
Really?

962
00:37:14,472 --> 00:37:14,680
Yeah.

963
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,311
I'm the prick?

964
00:37:15,374 --> 00:37:16,246
Yes.

965
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:17,287
Come on!

966
00:37:17,843 --> 00:37:19,117
We're not going to
bend over for this guy.

967
00:37:19,177 --> 00:37:23,182
We're gonna' do
it our own way.

968
00:37:23,248 --> 00:37:26,559
I'm fucked.

969
00:37:38,678 --> 00:37:42,023
You gave me your word.

970
00:37:42,081 --> 00:37:46,120
That money was going
to buy watches.

971
00:37:46,185 --> 00:37:47,357
It was.

972
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,993
We... we just...
um... Gina,

973
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:54,427
I've been trying to
figure out a way to...

974
00:38:10,643 --> 00:38:16,992
Gina.

975
00:38:26,225 --> 00:38:28,603
When I get
back from this trip,

976
00:38:28,661 --> 00:38:33,235
I'm moving into
Louisa's guest house.

977
00:38:33,299 --> 00:38:36,872
I'm gonna' use
one of her cars.

978
00:38:36,936 --> 00:38:41,385
You can have the Chevy
to drive to work.

979
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,748
Gina, I...

980
00:38:42,808 --> 00:38:44,253
Or drive it
to a car lot

981
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,984
and sell it for
gambling money.

982
00:38:47,046 --> 00:38:51,119
I don't care.

983
00:38:51,183 --> 00:38:54,926
I'm thinking about
myself for a change.

984
00:38:54,987 --> 00:38:57,369
Like you do all the time.

985
00:39:04,229 --> 00:39:05,145
Gina...

986
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,269
...can we just talk about it?

987
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,610
No. Don't touch me.

988
00:39:15,507 --> 00:39:17,112
Gina?

989
00:39:45,637 --> 00:39:46,780
What's going on, amigo?

990
00:40:01,687 --> 00:40:04,668
This is sexy, it
doesn't look like you.

991
00:40:04,723 --> 00:40:06,703
You've got some
very cute clothes.

992
00:40:06,758 --> 00:40:07,759
I've never seen these before.

993
00:40:07,826 --> 00:40:09,635
You should let me help
you make some outfits.

994
00:40:09,695 --> 00:40:11,265
I could spruce it up a bit.

995
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,274
I like them.

996
00:40:12,331 --> 00:40:14,140
And you sleep on these, okay?

997
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:17,009
These are for decor only.

998
00:40:42,461 --> 00:40:49,242
How did it
ever come to this?

999
00:40:49,301 --> 00:40:51,247
Unbelievable.

1000
00:40:58,443 --> 00:41:00,719
Did she call you back yet?

1001
00:41:00,779 --> 00:41:02,816
No.

1002
00:41:02,881 --> 00:41:06,973
I... I really did it this time.

1003
00:41:08,954 --> 00:41:10,558
I'm gonna' share
something with you

1004
00:41:10,622 --> 00:41:13,068
that I learned
a long time ago.

1005
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:15,833
Women?

1006
00:41:15,894 --> 00:41:17,638
They can't stay mad.

1007
00:41:20,198 --> 00:41:24,544
They are emotionally
resilient creatures, man.

1008
00:41:24,603 --> 00:41:26,947
Impressive.

1009
00:41:27,005 --> 00:41:29,144
They're all fucking crazy!

1010
00:41:29,207 --> 00:41:30,277
But they're resilient.

1011
00:41:30,342 --> 00:41:34,119
She'll be back
before you know it.

1012
00:41:34,179 --> 00:41:39,060
You know, buddy, it's not
like you got caught cheating.

1013
00:41:39,117 --> 00:41:40,289
You know what I mean?

1014
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:43,264
That's a whole other 12 miles
of bad road and STDs.

1015
00:41:43,321 --> 00:41:43,595
You know what I mean?

1016
00:41:43,655 --> 00:41:45,862
But you can...
you can lie.

1017
00:41:45,924 --> 00:41:48,302
You can forget
anniversaries.

1018
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,897
You can get drunk, show your
ass in front of the in-laws.

1019
00:41:50,962 --> 00:41:53,306
That's all...they'll
forgive all that shit, man.

1020
00:41:53,365 --> 00:41:57,745
But do not, you can not
get caught cheating.

1021
00:41:57,803 --> 00:42:00,306
Bro, they don't like it.

1022
00:42:00,372 --> 00:42:02,648
It'll fuck you every
time, trust me.

1023
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:06,656
So in about probably
26...27 days,

1024
00:42:06,712 --> 00:42:07,452
Gina will be back.

1025
00:42:07,512 --> 00:42:08,149
You want to bet on it?

1026
00:42:08,213 --> 00:42:10,386
I'll bet you on it.

1027
00:42:13,351 --> 00:42:17,390
Well, you guys have
been really great to work for.

1028
00:42:17,456 --> 00:42:18,434
Bren.

1029
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,491
Oh, Bren.

1030
00:42:19,558 --> 00:42:20,662
You've been
really great as well.

1031
00:42:20,726 --> 00:42:23,832
I'm so sorry.

1032
00:42:23,895 --> 00:42:24,703
No.

1033
00:42:24,763 --> 00:42:26,299
Yes, great.

1034
00:42:26,364 --> 00:42:31,177
So, what are
you guys going to do now?

1035
00:43:13,645 --> 00:43:15,022
Well, listen,
think of the alternative.

1036
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,286
I mean, look at my ex-husband.

1037
00:43:16,348 --> 00:43:20,125
Forty-seven years old, he's
got the dick of a teenager.

1038
00:43:20,185 --> 00:43:25,328
At least Matt's faithful,
you got that going for you.

1039
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:26,767
I like you and Matt
together, you know?

1040
00:43:26,825 --> 00:43:28,498
Please.

1041
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,231
No, stop.

1042
00:43:29,294 --> 00:43:32,605
I've had it.

1043
00:43:32,664 --> 00:43:34,666
Has he always gambled?

1044
00:43:34,733 --> 00:43:36,007
Oh, please.

1045
00:43:36,067 --> 00:43:38,513
I met him on a Reno
turn, remember?

1046
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:40,481
Oh, yeah, yeah,
you told me that.

1047
00:43:40,539 --> 00:43:42,951
Did I tell you that he
and Sam flipped a coin to see

1048
00:43:43,008 --> 00:43:44,487
who would ask me out?

1049
00:43:44,543 --> 00:43:49,014
No, I don't
remember that.

1050
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,286
I should have run the
other way

1051
00:43:50,348 --> 00:43:55,320
as soon as i heard that.

1052
00:43:55,387 --> 00:43:58,766
I really should have.

1053
00:44:19,311 --> 00:44:20,915
>> Attention dog lovers!

1054
00:44:20,979 --> 00:44:26,327

1065
00:44:47,405 --> 00:44:49,908
I'm coming
around the bend.

1066
00:44:49,975 --> 00:44:52,148
Who's flexible?

1067
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:53,314
Who's a dancer?

1068
00:44:53,378 --> 00:44:53,947
Come on!

1069
00:44:54,012 --> 00:44:54,956
Yeah, that's me.

1070
00:44:55,013 --> 00:44:56,356
Yeah, you like
that, don't you?

1071
00:44:56,414 --> 00:44:57,449
It's me, pick up.

1072
00:44:57,515 --> 00:44:57,993
Goddamn in

1073
00:44:58,049 --> 00:44:59,289
Fuck! Hold on.

1074
00:44:59,351 --> 00:45:00,796
Pick up!

1075
00:45:00,852 --> 00:45:01,330
Please!

1076
00:45:01,386 --> 00:45:02,057
Sam!

1077
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:02,689
It's Matt. It's Matt.

1078
00:45:02,754 --> 00:45:03,630
Yo, what's LIP, buddy?

1079
00:45:03,688 --> 00:45:04,496
Turn on channel 28.

1080
00:45:04,556 --> 00:45:05,830
What?

1081
00:45:05,891 --> 00:45:09,532
I'm really kind
of busy right now.

1082
00:45:09,594 --> 00:45:12,074
Goddamn it, turn on
channel 28!

1083
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:13,268
Fuck, give
me the remote!

1084
00:45:13,331 --> 00:45:13,900
What?

1085
00:45:13,965 --> 00:45:15,273
The remote!

1086
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:16,209
I'm so close!

1087
00:45:16,268 --> 00:45:17,246
Okay, hang on, hang on!

1088
00:45:17,302 --> 00:45:17,837
I got it.

1089
00:45:17,903 --> 00:45:18,506
Jesus!

1090
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:19,207
Hold on, okay.

1091
00:45:19,271 --> 00:45:21,251
OK.

1092
00:45:21,306 --> 00:45:23,217
Jesus, you sound hysterical!

1093
00:45:23,275 --> 00:45:24,447
>> Only $19.95.

1094
00:45:24,509 --> 00:45:28,012
>> The Dreaming Dog Watches
available in the top 20 breeds,

1095
00:45:28,078 --> 00:45:29,684
>> and comes with a
money back guarantee!

1096
00:45:29,748 --> 00:45:30,522
>> Look!

1097
00:45:30,582 --> 00:45:32,220
>> They've got a Westie!
- Holy...

1098
00:45:32,284 --> 00:45:34,452
>> The Shepherd!
-...what the...

1099
00:45:34,453 --> 00:45:35,256
- All twenty breeds.
>> The Malamute!

1100
00:45:36,755 --> 00:45:38,393
>> I love it, so does he.

1101
00:45:38,456 --> 00:45:39,196
>> Call now!

1102
00:45:39,257 --> 00:45:40,167
>> Supplies are limited!

1103
00:45:40,225 --> 00:45:42,262
> Call 1-800-555-DOGS.

1104
00:45:42,327 --> 00:45:45,728
>> That's 1-800-555-DOGS.
- Fucking rich... You...

1105
00:45:45,729 --> 00:45:47,673
>> Call now!
- You there?

1106
00:45:47,933 --> 00:45:49,429
So did you
have Mr. Newkin sign

1107
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:50,727
a non-disclosure agreement?

1108
00:45:50,965 --> 00:45:52,342
No, we didn't.

1109
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,074
You didn't?

1110
00:45:55,136 --> 00:45:56,240
Well, that's not essential.

1111
00:45:56,304 --> 00:45:59,114
By copying your
design exactly,

1112
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:02,587
Mr. Newkin has exhibited
malice of forethought.

1113
00:46:02,644 --> 00:46:03,918
What? What does that mean?

1114
00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:07,256
Oh, sorry.
You have a case.

1115
00:46:07,315 --> 00:46:08,726
Hot damn.

1116
00:46:08,783 --> 00:46:09,921
I told you, man.

1117
00:46:09,985 --> 00:46:11,020
Great.

1118
00:46:11,086 --> 00:46:12,622
How far are you willing
to go on this matter?

1119
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:14,325
Like a virgin
on prom night, baby!

1120
00:46:14,389 --> 00:46:15,299
All the way!

1121
00:46:15,357 --> 00:46:16,261
Let's do this!

1122
00:46:16,324 --> 00:46:17,559
Sam, I don't think

1123
00:46:17,626 --> 00:46:20,266
that's the question
he's asking.

1124
00:46:20,328 --> 00:46:23,241
Would you be prepared to take
this on a contingency basis?

1125
00:46:23,932 --> 00:46:26,344
No.
I couldn't do that.

1126
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:27,937
But you said
we had a case.

1127
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:30,477
Yeah, but this type
of case can be protracted.

1128
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,115
It can go on
for a long time.

1129
00:46:32,173 --> 00:46:38,317
But I might consider going
with a contingent contingency.

1130
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:38,983
Good, I want in

1131
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:39,457
I'm in!

1132
00:46:39,514 --> 00:46:40,458
What is it?

1133
00:46:40,515 --> 00:46:42,620
Contingent
contingency.

1134
00:46:42,684 --> 00:46:43,719
I'll write them a letter

1135
00:46:43,785 --> 00:46:45,560
If they respond
with a good offer,

1136
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:48,226
I'll take it on contingency.

1137
00:46:50,325 --> 00:46:52,498
And I say to the guy,
I say, "Sir, I'm sorry,

1138
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,030
but we do not have mints
or gum on this plane."

1139
00:46:56,097 --> 00:46:58,771
And he gives me this big
exasperated sigh, he says,

1140
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:01,541
"Do you mean to tell me you do
not have one goddamn mint on

1141
00:47:01,603 --> 00:47:03,605
this entire plane?"

1142
00:47:03,672 --> 00:47:04,548
Smoker.

1143
00:47:04,606 --> 00:47:05,516
Yeah, definitely.

1144
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:07,348
And a jerk.

1145
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:09,548
So Gina, come
outwith us

1146
00:47:09,611 --> 00:47:11,249
when we get to Portland.

1147
00:47:11,313 --> 00:47:12,451
No, thanks, Randall.

1148
00:47:12,514 --> 00:47:14,824
I'm just gonna'
order room service

1149
00:47:14,883 --> 00:47:17,693
and take a long hot bath.

1150
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:18,958
I know what
you're going through.

1151
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,624
It's not easy.

1152
00:47:20,689 --> 00:47:21,667
Tell you what.

1153
00:47:21,723 --> 00:47:23,498
I'll bring up a really
good bottle of wine,

1154
00:47:23,558 --> 00:47:26,334
and give you a massage.

1155
00:47:26,394 --> 00:47:28,237
Have you ever had
a Shiatsu before?

1156
00:47:28,296 --> 00:47:32,506
I mean like deep
tissue, just really...

1157
00:47:32,567 --> 00:47:33,841
emotions just float out.

1158
00:47:33,902 --> 00:47:36,075
The first time I ever
had one, I cried.

1159
00:47:36,137 --> 00:47:36,945
Thanks.

1160
00:47:37,005 --> 00:47:38,507
Yeah, it's
good, it lets it out

1161
00:47:38,573 --> 00:47:39,608
Have you ever had one?

1162
00:47:39,674 --> 00:47:40,550
No, Randall.

1163
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:43,020
Sit back.

1164
00:47:43,078 --> 00:47:45,149
Just trying to help.

1165
00:47:54,055 --> 00:47:55,864
Poor girl.

1166
00:47:59,527 --> 00:48:02,064
A cowboy
philosopher once told me,

1167
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:06,272
"If you find yourself in
a hole, stop digging."

1168
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:15,750
This is bullshit.

1169
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,619
I know about
these things, bro.

1170
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:19,488
They turn you into
feeling like a

1171
00:48:19,547 --> 00:48:21,493
fucking plucked chicken.

1172
00:48:21,549 --> 00:48:23,085
I didn't
ask you to some.

1173
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:24,789
Okay, guys,
let's get started.

1174
00:48:24,853 --> 00:48:26,161
If you're going to
be a dick, just leave now.

1175
00:48:26,221 --> 00:48:30,135
I'm just saying,
it's not even legitimate.

1176
00:48:32,727 --> 00:48:36,334
Hey, good crowd.

1177
00:48:36,398 --> 00:48:38,207
It's all fucking
propaganda if you ask me.

1178
00:48:38,266 --> 00:48:40,303
We're all here
for the same reason.

1179
00:48:40,368 --> 00:48:43,144
Our lives have gone
out of control.

1180
00:48:43,204 --> 00:48:49,052
We all wanted to be big
shots, be rich, powerful,

1181
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:50,680
but without the effort.

1182
00:48:50,745 --> 00:48:52,725
A something for nothing
approach to life.

1183
00:48:52,781 --> 00:48:56,729
Sounds good to me.

1184
00:48:56,785 --> 00:49:00,494
My name is Kelly, and
I'm a compulsive gambler.

1185
00:49:00,555 --> 00:49:03,627
Hi, Kelly.

1186
00:49:04,459 --> 00:49:05,836
My name is Glenda,

1187
00:49:05,894 --> 00:49:07,874
and I'm a compulsive gambler.

1188
00:49:07,929 --> 00:49:13,902
Hi, Glenda.

1189
00:49:13,968 --> 00:49:17,814
My name is Matt, and
I have a gambling problem.

1190
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:22,844
Hi, Matt.

1191
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:43,668
Hi, it's me,
Louisa.

1192
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,802
I signed you up for the real
estate exam next month.

1193
00:49:45,867 --> 00:49:50,475
I hope you're
serious about this.

1194
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:53,079
Hey-

1195
00:49:53,141 --> 00:49:58,352
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm sending you a check

1196
00:49:58,413 --> 00:50:01,485
for the payment to
your credit union.

1197
00:50:01,549 --> 00:50:06,549
And, well, when you feel
like talking...I'll see you.

1198
00:50:37,752 --> 00:50:40,926
I kept telling myself
something Edison said:

1199
00:50:40,989 --> 00:50:42,666
"A lot of people don't realize

1200
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:44,223
how close they are to success

1201
00:50:44,224 --> 00:50:47,805
when they give up."

1202
00:51:06,314 --> 00:51:09,852
The combo, man.

1203
00:51:09,918 --> 00:51:11,226
The shooter.

1204
00:51:15,089 --> 00:51:20,004
So did Newkin's lawyer
end up saying forget it?

1205
00:51:20,061 --> 00:51:20,507
Yeah.

1206
00:51:22,564 --> 00:51:23,338
Essentially.

1207
00:51:23,398 --> 00:51:25,571
I mean, it starts out the way
they always do,

1208
00:51:25,633 --> 00:51:28,880
"Thank you so much for bringing
this to our attention, but..."

1209
00:51:28,936 --> 00:51:29,637
Go fuck yourself, right?

1210
00:51:29,704 --> 00:51:31,843
Exactly.

1211
00:51:31,906 --> 00:51:33,886
Say good night, Sammy.

1212
00:51:33,942 --> 00:51:35,512
Good shot, man.

1213
00:51:42,817 --> 00:51:44,548
You sell any
LA-Z-BOYS lately?

1214
00:51:47,956 --> 00:51:51,462
I am in danger of
being employee of the month.

1215
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:55,371
That's good.

1216
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:58,172
Well, I'm asshole of the day.

1217
00:51:58,232 --> 00:51:59,870
I think I could get
used to working there,

1218
00:51:59,934 --> 00:52:03,746
and then wake up suddenly
20 years from now...

1219
00:52:03,805 --> 00:52:05,375
Oh, please stop
talking about it,

1220
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,032
that scares the
shit out of me.

1221
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:13,351
Am I gonna' end
up some pathetic,

1222
00:52:13,414 --> 00:52:17,658
lonely sixty-year-old framer?

1223
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:22,632
Hey, guys.

1224
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:25,227
Like another one?

1225
00:52:25,293 --> 00:52:26,328
Can't hurt.

1226
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:28,874
Okay.

1227
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:32,844
Ice cold ones coming up.

1228
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,244
Oh, yeah.

1229
00:52:35,303 --> 00:52:36,577
It's time for a beer.

1230
00:52:36,637 --> 00:52:37,767
Thank you, man.

1231
00:52:45,046 --> 00:52:46,650
I'm gonna' go
drop the kids off.

1232
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:57,628
"Oh yeah...

1233
00:52:57,692 --> 00:52:59,694
...time for a beer."

1234
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:17,011
Yes.

1235
00:53:17,078 --> 00:53:20,719
Hold on, Mr. Chow,
it's coming in right now.

1236
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:25,025
OK.

1237
00:53:25,086 --> 00:53:25,689
Right.

1238
00:53:25,753 --> 00:53:27,289
No battery compartment.

1239
00:53:27,355 --> 00:53:28,561
That's gonna' be a
problem.

1240
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,329
We need room for
the circuit board.

1241
00:53:30,391 --> 00:53:31,631
Well, it is too bulky.

1242
00:53:31,692 --> 00:53:33,501
Yeah, I know
it looks bad, but...

1243
00:53:33,561 --> 00:53:35,131
Yeah, well, get
your engineers on it,

1244
00:53:35,196 --> 00:53:37,608
see if you can, I don't know,
reduce the circuit board.

1245
00:53:37,665 --> 00:53:39,667
We'll try.
I'll send you a fax.

1246
00:53:39,734 --> 00:53:41,213
Okay. Tonight, yeah?

1247
00:53:41,268 --> 00:53:42,212
We'll try.

1248
00:53:42,269 --> 00:53:44,215
Excellent. And no buttons.

1249
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,691
Oh yeah!

1250
00:54:03,758 --> 00:54:05,203
Time for a beer!

1251
00:54:15,282 --> 00:54:18,820
Hey!

1252
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,994
Where's the fire?

1253
00:54:21,054 --> 00:54:21,794
You all right?

1254
00:54:21,855 --> 00:54:23,994
Yeah, I'm great.

1255
00:54:24,057 --> 00:54:25,229
Jesus, man!

1256
00:54:25,292 --> 00:54:26,202
Let me ask
you a question.

1257
00:54:26,259 --> 00:54:26,933
Yeah?

1258
00:54:26,994 --> 00:54:29,533
We, together, have run
our business into the ground,

1259
00:54:29,596 --> 00:54:32,543
my wife left me, we're
working shit jobs,

1260
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:34,943
we're completely broke, and
we're approaching middle age.

1261
00:54:35,002 --> 00:54:38,006
It's reason to be depressed,
wouldn't you think?

1262
00:54:38,071 --> 00:54:39,709
Do I look depressed?

1263
00:54:39,773 --> 00:54:40,444
I don't know.

1264
00:54:40,507 --> 00:54:42,180
Look! Do I look depressed?

1265
00:54:42,242 --> 00:54:43,448
Is this a trick question?

1266
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:45,421
Bro, we've been
friends for twenty years.

1267
00:54:45,479 --> 00:54:47,117
We've been through
a lot of shit.

1268
00:54:47,181 --> 00:54:49,889
But I'm telling you, man, we
are on the verge

1269
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:53,625
of living the dream!

1270
00:54:53,687 --> 00:54:54,688
All right, look.

1271
00:54:54,755 --> 00:54:57,668
Sammy's here, everything's
gonna' be okay.

1272
00:54:57,724 --> 00:54:58,327
Hugs?

1273
00:54:58,392 --> 00:54:58,927
You need hugs?

1274
00:54:58,992 --> 00:54:59,936
Come on, it's Okay.

1275
00:54:59,993 --> 00:55:00,562
No, you know,
I don't need a hug.

1276
00:55:00,627 --> 00:55:01,105
You know what I do need?

1277
00:55:01,161 --> 00:55:01,764
What's that?

1278
00:55:01,828 --> 00:55:02,898
I need a beer.

1279
00:55:02,963 --> 00:55:03,634
I like beer.

1280
00:55:03,697 --> 00:55:04,801
Do you like beer?

1281
00:55:04,865 --> 00:55:05,639
Let's have a beer.

1282
00:55:05,699 --> 00:55:06,302
Why don't you
get us some beer.

1283
00:55:06,366 --> 00:55:06,810
OK.

1284
00:55:06,867 --> 00:55:07,470
All right.

1285
00:55:07,534 --> 00:55:08,137
I'll get you a beer.

1286
00:55:08,202 --> 00:55:09,840
All right.

1287
00:55:10,237 --> 00:55:13,411
You're
acting weird, man.

1288
00:55:14,841 --> 00:55:16,616
Unbelievable.

1289
00:55:19,646 --> 00:55:21,626
Oh, is there not
an opener over there?

1290
00:55:21,682 --> 00:55:22,626
That's too bad.

1291
00:55:22,683 --> 00:55:25,323
I flaked.

1292
00:55:25,385 --> 00:55:28,025
Hey, why
don't you try this.

1293
00:55:28,088 --> 00:55:29,590
You sure you're
all right, man?

1294
00:55:29,656 --> 00:55:31,567
You seem crazy.

1295
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:34,504
I feel like I should be
concerned about you.

1296
00:55:34,561 --> 00:55:36,802
>> Oh, yes! I like beer!

1297
00:55:38,303 --> 00:55:39,747
That is hysterical.

1298
00:55:40,734 --> 00:55:43,511
>> Oh, yes! I like beer!

1299
00:55:44,571 --> 00:55:46,448
Wait a minute.

1300
00:55:49,243 --> 00:55:51,655
Where'd you get this?

1301
00:55:51,712 --> 00:55:55,751
Where do you think?

1302
00:55:55,816 --> 00:55:57,659
You son a bitch.

1303
00:55:57,718 --> 00:55:58,526
How much?

1304
00:55:58,585 --> 00:56:01,361
$6.95 retail.

1305
00:56:01,421 --> 00:56:02,627
Well, it
sounds amazing, man!

1306
00:56:02,689 --> 00:56:03,394
It's an
automatic sound.

1307
00:56:03,457 --> 00:56:04,527
There's no buttons.

1308
00:56:04,591 --> 00:56:05,399
But the best thing
about it is it surprises you!

1309
00:56:05,459 --> 00:56:06,529
It's a total surprise!

1310
00:56:06,593 --> 00:56:07,435
What's the minimum?

1311
00:56:07,494 --> 00:56:08,404
Five thousand units.

1312
00:56:08,462 --> 00:56:10,032
Oh, shit.

1313
00:56:10,097 --> 00:56:10,973
I can sell that in a week!

1314
00:56:11,031 --> 00:56:12,374
Bro, this is it!

1315
00:56:12,432 --> 00:56:13,433
This is the one!

1316
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,979
This is a chain store product!

1317
00:56:15,035 --> 00:56:17,777
This goes everywhere, man!

1318
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:19,749
Jesus Christ!

1319
00:56:19,806 --> 00:56:20,841
And hey, you know what?

1320
00:56:20,907 --> 00:56:22,909
this
little thing right here,

1321
00:56:22,976 --> 00:56:24,478
this is gonna' get
you Gina back, man.

1322
00:56:24,544 --> 00:56:25,579
Maybe.

1323
00:56:25,646 --> 00:56:26,522
If I can repay her.

1324
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:27,898
Oh, I promise you that.

1325
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,190
We gotta' get this out before
Newkin prick-ass

1326
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:31,354
gets a hold of it, right?

1327
00:56:31,818 --> 00:56:33,126
Oh, Newkin's not
gonna' find out about this!

1328
00:56:33,186 --> 00:56:35,166
We introduce it at
the L.A. Gift Expo.

1329
00:56:35,221 --> 00:56:36,822
- L.A. Gift Show, right, right!
- You know what I mean?

1330
00:56:36,823 --> 00:56:37,665
We'll kill Newkin!

1331
00:56:37,724 --> 00:56:38,828
And hey, look at me!

1332
00:56:38,892 --> 00:56:40,530
I'm gonna' get the money
for this, somehow some way!

1333
00:56:40,594 --> 00:56:42,938
I just spent the rent
money on this prototype.

1334
00:56:42,996 --> 00:56:43,997
Yeah, well, I got it.

1335
00:56:44,064 --> 00:56:45,805
I don't care
where, I'll get it.

1336
00:56:45,866 --> 00:56:48,039
Oh,
yes! I like beer!

1337
00:56:48,101 --> 00:56:48,636
Oh, yes!

1338
00:56:48,702 --> 00:56:51,444
I like beer!

1339
00:57:17,998 --> 00:57:18,806
Hey-

1340
00:57:18,865 --> 00:57:22,938
How are you?

1341
00:57:23,003 --> 00:57:25,279
You look great.

1342
00:57:25,338 --> 00:57:26,840
You, too.

1343
00:57:26,907 --> 00:57:27,942
How are you, Sam?

1344
00:57:28,008 --> 00:57:29,180
What's going on?

1345
00:57:29,242 --> 00:57:34,555
Well, I'm...summer
time, right?

1346
00:57:34,614 --> 00:57:38,790
Pounding nails in the desert,
that sucks man.

1347
00:57:38,852 --> 00:57:40,388
Something to drink?

1348
00:57:40,453 --> 00:57:44,595
Just water, please.

1349
00:57:44,658 --> 00:57:48,970
So, did
you talk to Matt?

1350
00:57:49,029 --> 00:57:50,474
You know, he's
doing all right.

1351
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:54,740
He's doing his thing.

1352
00:57:54,801 --> 00:57:58,271
But my idea man is reduced to
selling furniture

1353
00:57:58,338 --> 00:58:01,512
in a strip mall.

1354
00:58:01,575 --> 00:58:05,785
Sam, is that
why you called,

1355
00:58:05,845 --> 00:58:10,624
to tell me you're
worried about Matt?

1356
00:58:10,684 --> 00:58:14,996
Well, look, I
know he fucked up, okay?

1357
00:58:15,055 --> 00:58:17,763
But don't we all,
right, you, me?

1358
00:58:17,824 --> 00:58:20,532
I mean, you should just be
happy that Matt won that coin

1359
00:58:20,594 --> 00:58:23,097
toss instead of me, because
I am the train wreck.

1360
00:58:23,163 --> 00:58:26,872
I am the fuck up, right?

1361
00:58:26,933 --> 00:58:29,004
I mean, you should just call
him, and say,

1362
00:58:29,069 --> 00:58:32,073
"Hey, Matt, how are you doing?"

1363
00:58:32,138 --> 00:58:33,310
And he'd say,
"Oh, Gina, you know,

1364
00:58:33,373 --> 00:58:36,980
I've been doing a
little bit Of this,

1365
00:58:37,043 --> 00:58:39,080
a little bit of that."

1366
00:58:44,384 --> 00:58:48,264
Try it.

1367
00:58:49,689 --> 00:58:54,570
Oh yes! I like beer!

1368
00:58:54,628 --> 00:58:55,868
Did Matt
come up with this?

1369
00:58:55,929 --> 00:58:56,839
Yeah.

1370
00:58:56,896 --> 00:58:58,000
How's he do it?

1371
00:58:58,064 --> 00:58:59,236
Oh, you
know, it's simple.

1372
00:58:59,299 --> 00:59:01,176
I think it has to do with like
the metal and the...yeah,

1373
00:59:01,234 --> 00:59:02,872
I have no idea.

1374
00:59:02,936 --> 00:59:09,061
But ur, Gina, this...
is the one, telling you.

1375
00:59:12,045 --> 00:59:17,927
So we've been talking
to some investors and...

1376
00:59:17,984 --> 00:59:20,589
I just thought maybe
your sister Louisa

1377
00:59:20,653 --> 00:59:22,012
might be interested.

1378
00:59:24,891 --> 00:59:26,866
Matt ask you...?

1379
00:59:26,926 --> 00:59:29,839
No, he hasn't.
He doesn't know I'm here.

1380
00:59:29,896 --> 00:59:32,706
Was this his idea?

1381
00:59:32,766 --> 00:59:35,178
No, that would be mine.

1382
00:59:35,235 --> 00:59:40,048
Yeah, you know, call me crazy,
but she likes to make money.

1383
00:59:40,106 --> 00:59:41,449
She wouldn't
touch this, Sam.

1384
00:59:41,508 --> 00:59:42,452
No?

1385
00:59:42,509 --> 00:59:46,514
No. Trust me. Listen,
I got to get going.

1386
00:59:46,579 --> 00:59:49,321
I've got an early check-in and
I haven't packed yet, so...

1387
00:59:49,382 --> 00:59:50,417
All right.

1388
00:59:50,483 --> 00:59:51,359
I got it, I got it.

1389
00:59:51,418 --> 00:59:51,896
I got it.

1390
00:59:51,951 --> 00:59:53,988
It's fine.

1391
00:59:54,054 --> 00:59:55,727
We've got a
big show coming up,

1392
00:59:55,789 --> 00:59:58,201
so...normally I would
never ask this, you know.

1393
00:59:58,258 --> 00:59:59,703
I'd never...it's just
that, you know...

1394
00:59:59,759 --> 01:00:01,204
Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam!

1395
01:00:01,261 --> 01:00:02,103
She wouldn't do it.

1396
01:00:02,162 --> 01:00:02,867
No?

1397
01:00:02,929 --> 01:00:03,532
Take care, man.

1398
01:00:03,596 --> 01:00:03,972
All right.

1399
01:00:04,031 --> 01:00:06,101
Hey, come on, give
me a hug at least!

1400
01:00:09,369 --> 01:00:14,148
Good to see you.

1401
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:17,086
You look gorgeous.

1402
01:00:18,278 --> 01:00:19,450
I loved Sam
like a brother,

1403
01:00:19,512 --> 01:00:21,856
but he drives me crazy.

1404
01:00:21,915 --> 01:00:24,156
You never knew what he was
going to say or do next.

1405
01:00:24,217 --> 01:00:26,163
There wasn't a thought that
entered his head that didn't

1406
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:28,358
come straight
out of his mouth.

1407
01:00:28,421 --> 01:00:31,595
He acts on every scheme, and
to hell with the consequences.

1408
01:00:32,892 --> 01:00:34,303
What the fuck?

1409
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:37,068
This is how we
get Gina's money back.

1410
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:38,302
Sam, is it drugs?

1411
01:00:38,364 --> 01:00:39,502
Yes, it's drugs.

1412
01:00:39,566 --> 01:00:40,636
No, it's not fucking drugs.

1413
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:44,341
How stupid do you think I am?

1414
01:00:44,404 --> 01:00:46,816
All right, this is it.

1415
01:00:46,873 --> 01:00:48,750
OK.

1416
01:00:50,343 --> 01:00:52,414
You know, every once in a
while an opportunity

1417
01:00:52,479 --> 01:00:54,618
presents itself
right under our nose.

1418
01:00:54,681 --> 01:00:57,059
We just have to reach
out there and grab them!

1419
01:00:57,117 --> 01:00:58,027
You're acting
weird, brother.

1420
01:00:58,084 --> 01:00:59,358
No, don't
worry about that.

1421
01:00:59,419 --> 01:01:01,729
The bartender Carl,
he's got this buddy, J.J.

1422
01:01:01,788 --> 01:01:04,792
Now, J.J., he's been going out
to the desert and he's been

1423
01:01:04,858 --> 01:01:10,331
making an absolute
fortune swiping saguaros.

1424
01:01:10,396 --> 01:01:12,774
Okay, we're getting our
seed money

1425
01:01:12,832 --> 01:01:14,470
from committing a felony.

1426
01:01:14,534 --> 01:01:15,444
It's a felony!

1427
01:01:15,502 --> 01:01:16,708
No, no, not really, man.

1428
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:18,113
You see, because
he's got a permit,

1429
01:01:18,171 --> 01:01:20,583
and he goes and gets prickly
pears and the barrel cactuses,

1430
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,677
and he swipes, you know,
a few saguaros, man.

1431
01:01:22,742 --> 01:01:24,483
Now, these things go for
eight hundred dollars a foot,

1432
01:01:24,544 --> 01:01:26,080
and then these arms,
these go for four hundred.

1433
01:01:26,146 --> 01:01:27,716
$0 this is like
ten, twenty grand!

1434
01:01:27,781 --> 01:01:29,761
It's like
two, three tons!

1435
01:01:29,816 --> 01:01:32,922
What do you think
you're doing?

1436
01:01:32,986 --> 01:01:34,863
Okay, where did
you get all this?

1437
01:01:34,921 --> 01:01:38,869
Here's a shovel.

1438
01:01:38,925 --> 01:01:40,927
Look at the
size of that thing!

1439
01:01:40,994 --> 01:01:43,065
Let's do this.

1440
01:01:43,129 --> 01:01:44,631
A four
hundred-year-old plant

1441
01:01:44,697 --> 01:01:45,641
you're going to chop down?

1442
01:01:45,698 --> 01:01:46,574
That no one's
gonna' miss, buddy.

1443
01:01:46,633 --> 01:01:49,170
Fifty yards off
the goddamn I-191

1444
01:01:49,235 --> 01:01:50,646
Come on, let's
get out of here.

1445
01:01:50,703 --> 01:01:52,546
The Border Patrol is
gonna' be by, seriously.

1446
01:01:52,605 --> 01:01:55,984
Come on, I
need your help!

1447
01:01:56,042 --> 01:01:57,817
Fuck!

1448
01:01:57,877 --> 01:01:58,582
Look at yourself!

1449
01:01:58,645 --> 01:01:59,555
You're a cactus thief!

1450
01:01:59,612 --> 01:02:00,920
You're a fucking cactus thief!

1451
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,118
Hello?

1452
01:02:02,182 --> 01:02:05,959
Grab your fucking
shovel and help me dig, man!

1453
01:02:06,019 --> 01:02:06,997
Come on, man.

1454
01:02:07,053 --> 01:02:08,498
We're desperate, we're
not this desperate!

1455
01:02:08,555 --> 01:02:10,364
Come on, man!

1456
01:02:10,423 --> 01:02:12,061
Just calm
down for a second.

1457
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:13,934
Come on, bastard!

1458
01:02:13,993 --> 01:02:15,495
Come on!

1459
01:02:15,562 --> 01:02:20,562
Fuck!

1460
01:02:26,406 --> 01:02:27,384
This is it, man.

1461
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,510
I mean, I got nothing.

1462
01:02:28,575 --> 01:02:31,215
You know that's not true.

1463
01:02:31,277 --> 01:02:34,190
Come on, we've been worse.

1464
01:02:34,247 --> 01:02:36,557
Somethings gonna'...we're
gonna' figure this out, man,

1465
01:02:36,616 --> 01:02:41,565
and it ain't gonna'
be with this cactus.

1466
01:02:41,621 --> 01:02:44,067
All right.

1467
01:02:47,227 --> 01:02:49,400
There you go.

1468
01:02:56,175 --> 01:02:57,017
That's nuts!

1469
01:02:57,076 --> 01:02:58,578
It's nuts!

1470
01:02:58,644 --> 01:03:00,920
And you just reached in there
and all of a sudden there was

1471
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,084
this talking...

1472
01:03:02,148 --> 01:03:04,754
Beer opener.

1473
01:03:04,817 --> 01:03:05,887
I want to show Tom.

1474
01:03:05,951 --> 01:03:06,622
No, no, I'm gonna' show...

1475
01:03:06,685 --> 01:03:07,720
No, Rita,
it's a secret!

1476
01:03:07,786 --> 01:03:08,730
A secret!

1477
01:03:08,787 --> 01:03:11,734
Tom, check it out.

1478
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:13,167
What is it?

1479
01:03:13,225 --> 01:03:15,068
Oh,
yes! I like beer!

1480
01:03:15,127 --> 01:03:18,267
How cool is that?

1481
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:19,968
Hey, I have got
to get one of these.

1482
01:03:20,032 --> 01:03:21,238
Where can I get one?

1483
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,439
I've got an Air Force buddy
who would just flip for this.

1484
01:03:23,502 --> 01:03:27,507
Yeah my... my husband
invented it, so...

1485
01:03:27,573 --> 01:03:29,610
I thought you
two were separated?

1486
01:03:29,675 --> 01:03:32,178
We are.

1487
01:03:33,412 --> 01:03:35,915
I think people grow up
with an idea about what their

1488
01:03:35,981 --> 01:03:39,428
life is going to be, and it's
hard to break out of that.

1489
01:03:39,485 --> 01:03:43,934
All it takes is
a little faith.

1490
01:03:43,989 --> 01:03:47,459
It's like when the Wizard
gave the Scarecrow a diploma.

1491
01:03:47,526 --> 01:03:50,564
It completely changed the
Scarecrow's idea of himself,

1492
01:03:50,629 --> 01:03:54,543
and he was able to do things
he never thought he could do.

1493
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,409
Your last flight.

1494
01:03:56,968 --> 01:03:57,344
Jealous.

1495
01:03:57,403 --> 01:04:00,407
It's a little scary.

1496
01:04:00,472 --> 01:04:02,713
You think you're
gonna' like real estate?

1497
01:04:02,775 --> 01:04:07,224
Well, if I can get past
the paperwork,

1498
01:04:07,279 --> 01:04:10,282
and Louisa being
a control freak.

1499
01:04:10,348 --> 01:04:11,418
Oh, yeah.

1500
01:04:11,483 --> 01:04:13,719
You know it. You're gonna'
be pretty good at it.

1501
01:04:13,785 --> 01:04:19,001
I mean, people warm up to you.

1502
01:04:19,058 --> 01:04:21,095
I'm going to miss
buddy-bidding with you, Rita.

1503
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,060
Don't start. No.

1504
01:04:25,764 --> 01:04:27,300
Come down to
scheduling with me.

1505
01:04:27,366 --> 01:04:29,437
I want to check
on my trip trade.

1506
01:04:32,271 --> 01:04:36,413
Surprise!

1507
01:04:48,354 --> 01:04:50,425
Mike!

1508
01:04:50,489 --> 01:04:52,025
Bridget!

1509
01:04:52,091 --> 01:04:53,803
Good luck.

1510
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:45,010
And we were
just going to talk.

1511
01:05:45,077 --> 01:05:50,077
Well, I'm so
glad to have you back.

1512
01:06:00,693 --> 01:06:03,441
I'm not
ready to come back.

1513
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,571
Well, you
could've fooled me.

1514
01:06:10,636 --> 01:06:12,946
I mean, what's...

1515
01:06:13,005 --> 01:06:15,315
I know it doesn't
make sense, but...

1516
01:06:30,389 --> 01:06:34,428
Could you call Sam and
see what he's doing tonight?

1517
01:06:34,493 --> 01:06:40,375
There's something I'd like
to go over with you guys.

1518
01:06:40,432 --> 01:06:41,911
You came up with it.

1519
01:06:41,967 --> 01:06:43,503
I might say it, but
you said it too, once.

1520
01:06:43,569 --> 01:06:44,839
You would say it again
and again and again

1521
01:06:44,903 --> 01:06:46,546
with each product,
"This is the one..."

1522
01:06:46,605 --> 01:06:47,901
Yes. Okay, maybe.

1523
01:06:47,902 --> 01:06:48,339
Maybe.

1524
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:49,341
Yes. See?

1525
01:06:49,408 --> 01:06:51,513
See anyway, who cares?
What's the point, right?

1526
01:06:51,543 --> 01:06:55,355
The point is that I think
this is the one

1527
01:06:55,414 --> 01:06:59,692
you guys have been
waiting on.

1528
01:07:00,252 --> 01:07:00,890
Really?

1529
01:07:00,953 --> 01:07:02,830
I showed it around
our union meeting last week,

1530
01:07:02,888 --> 01:07:07,337
and everybody,
everybody wanted one.

1531
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:10,469
You show it
to your sister?

1532
01:07:10,529 --> 01:07:11,507
I did.

1533
01:07:11,563 --> 01:07:12,064
Yeah?

1534
01:07:12,131 --> 01:07:13,269
And?

1535
01:07:13,332 --> 01:07:15,744
She said no.

1536
01:07:15,801 --> 01:07:19,044
God!

1537
01:07:19,104 --> 01:07:21,445
And she's gonna' freak
when she finds out

1538
01:07:21,506 --> 01:07:25,480
what I've done,
but let her.

1539
01:07:26,044 --> 01:07:30,550
I'm going to pay for
the opening order.

1540
01:07:30,615 --> 01:07:33,118
That's your
retirement money.

1541
01:07:33,184 --> 01:07:35,562
I know, Matt, but I think
this is an opportunity.

1542
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:37,293
Listen, Gina,
it's really...

1543
01:07:37,355 --> 01:07:38,766
Whoa, whoa, will
you shut up for a second?

1544
01:07:38,823 --> 01:07:40,666
Can't you see what she's
really trying to do here?

1545
01:07:40,725 --> 01:07:42,136
I mean, I can see it.

1546
01:07:42,193 --> 01:07:43,968
She's trying to get a
fresh start for you guys.

1547
01:07:44,029 --> 01:07:45,064
That's what it is, right?

1548
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:47,201
Sam, this is business.

1549
01:07:47,265 --> 01:07:48,642
Oh.

1550
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:49,337
Well, who cares?

1551
01:07:49,401 --> 01:07:50,379
I don't care.

1552
01:07:50,435 --> 01:07:51,311
Cut it.

1553
01:07:51,369 --> 01:07:52,109
I'm in!

1554
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:52,910
Thank you.

1555
01:07:52,971 --> 01:07:55,508
Don't thank me yet.

1556
01:07:55,573 --> 01:08:00,573
So, the opening order,
plus $6400 additional

1557
01:08:07,085 --> 01:08:11,556
to pay Bean what you
owe him, and rehire him.

1558
01:08:11,623 --> 01:08:13,159
And he controls the checkbook.

1559
01:08:13,224 --> 01:08:13,998
Yes.

1560
01:08:14,059 --> 01:08:15,663
Of course.

1561
01:08:15,727 --> 01:08:16,671
Yeah, it's fine by me.

1562
01:08:16,728 --> 01:08:18,036
Okay.

1563
01:08:18,096 --> 01:08:19,074
The other thing is...

1564
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:20,700
And?

1565
01:08:20,765 --> 01:08:26,044
I want one-third
of the profits.

1566
01:08:27,973 --> 01:08:30,476
The early-out bonus isn't
enough for a house,

1567
01:08:30,542 --> 01:08:36,720
and I'm not sure I'm
cut out for real estate.

1568
01:08:36,781 --> 01:08:37,885
Yeah.

1569
01:08:37,949 --> 01:08:41,260
That's fine with me.

1570
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:43,424
A third?

1571
01:08:43,488 --> 01:08:45,764
Jesus!

1572
01:08:45,824 --> 01:08:48,430
What happens if you
guys get back together?

1573
01:08:48,493 --> 01:08:49,096
That's two-thirds!

1574
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,436
I'm getting railroaded!

1575
01:08:51,496 --> 01:08:52,770
Still a third.

1576
01:08:52,831 --> 01:08:54,606
Okay, Gina.

1577
01:08:54,666 --> 01:08:55,770
You're shrewd, all right.

1578
01:08:55,834 --> 01:08:57,711
OK.

1579
01:08:57,769 --> 01:09:00,750
I'm thinking of a number here,
I'm gonna' throw it out there.

1580
01:09:00,805 --> 01:09:04,378
40-40-20.
How about it?

1581
01:09:04,442 --> 01:09:05,512
A third.

1582
01:09:05,577 --> 01:09:08,649
Think about it.
25. How about it?

1583
01:09:08,713 --> 01:09:09,987
Look at me. It's a good deal.

1584
01:09:10,048 --> 01:09:12,324
A third.

1585
01:09:12,384 --> 01:09:15,524
Thirty-three point
three, three, three.

1586
01:09:15,587 --> 01:09:16,258
All right, fuck it!

1587
01:09:16,321 --> 01:09:16,958
Who cares, man?

1588
01:09:17,022 --> 01:09:18,296
Let's do this!

1589
01:09:18,356 --> 01:09:20,427
There's enough money to
go around for all of us!

1590
01:09:20,492 --> 01:09:21,493
What the hell am I thinking?

1591
01:09:21,559 --> 01:09:22,333
Amen.

1592
01:09:22,394 --> 01:09:23,395
Right?

1593
01:09:23,461 --> 01:09:24,872
I mean, this is amazing!

1594
01:09:24,929 --> 01:09:27,000
I love you guys!

1595
01:09:27,065 --> 01:09:30,046
Okay, Dave, let
me set the scene for you.

1596
01:09:30,101 --> 01:09:30,806
All right.

1597
01:09:30,869 --> 01:09:32,542
You just
got home from work.

1598
01:09:32,604 --> 01:09:34,208
You're heading in the house,
and you head straight for the

1599
01:09:34,272 --> 01:09:36,548
refrigerator, open
the door, and...

1600
01:09:36,608 --> 01:09:38,679
Oh yeah!

1601
01:09:38,743 --> 01:09:41,656
Time for a beer!

1602
01:09:41,713 --> 01:09:44,990
This time...the only
reason you go to work in the

1603
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:47,690
morning is to get to this
moment with the beer at night.

1604
01:09:47,752 --> 01:09:49,288
Yeah, baby.

1605
01:09:49,354 --> 01:09:50,162
Oh yeah!

1606
01:09:50,221 --> 01:09:52,167
Time for a beer!

1607
01:09:52,223 --> 01:09:53,327
That's it. That's good.

1608
01:09:53,391 --> 01:09:55,098
That's it.

1609
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:55,695
Cool.

1610
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:56,295
You're amazing.

1611
01:09:56,361 --> 01:09:57,738
Thank you.

1612
01:09:57,796 --> 01:10:00,709
Maybe try it with a
chuckle on the 'Oh, yeah!'

1613
01:10:00,765 --> 01:10:02,301
Okay, sure.

1614
01:10:02,367 --> 01:10:03,641
Take two,
Talking Beer Opener?

1615
01:10:03,701 --> 01:10:04,479
- Yep.
- Yep.

1616
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:08,174
Oh yeah!
Time for a beer!

1617
01:10:10,809 --> 01:10:14,154
Yeah!

1618
01:10:46,177 --> 01:10:47,121
Hello?

1619
01:10:47,178 --> 01:10:49,055
Hi, it's me.

1620
01:10:49,114 --> 01:10:49,956
Hey-

1621
01:10:50,014 --> 01:10:50,890
Any word
on the container?

1622
01:10:50,949 --> 01:10:53,361
Yeah, they're
still stuck in customs.

1623
01:10:53,418 --> 01:10:55,625
I'll call the steamship
company tomorrow.

1624
01:10:55,687 --> 01:10:58,190
I don't imagine it'll be
more than a couple of days.

1625
01:10:58,256 --> 01:11:01,965
Also, this flyer should
go out tonight, so...

1626
01:11:02,026 --> 01:11:03,596
It's really
all happening.

1627
01:11:03,661 --> 01:11:05,436
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

1628
01:11:09,501 --> 01:11:10,707
Listen, I've got to go.

1629
01:11:10,768 --> 01:11:12,042
Louisa's here, so..

1630
01:11:12,103 --> 01:11:16,483
All right, bye.

1631
01:11:16,541 --> 01:11:17,246
Matt?

1632
01:11:17,308 --> 01:11:18,218
Uh-huh.

1633
01:11:18,276 --> 01:11:18,811
Well?

1634
01:11:18,877 --> 01:11:19,947
Well what?

1635
01:11:20,011 --> 01:11:22,287
Did you do what I said and
ask for your money back?

1636
01:11:22,347 --> 01:11:24,657
Louisa,
you don't listen!

1637
01:11:24,716 --> 01:11:26,423
I told you,
it's a done deal.

1638
01:11:26,484 --> 01:11:28,095
The container is
in Long Beach.

1639
01:11:28,152 --> 01:11:30,220
Next week, we're
introducing the opener

1640
01:11:30,221 --> 01:11:31,628
at the L.A. Gift Expo.

1641
01:11:31,689 --> 01:11:33,100
Uh, you're so naive.

1642
01:11:33,158 --> 01:11:34,330
What do you know
about business?

1643
01:11:34,392 --> 01:11:36,736
What did you know about
real estate when you started?

1644
01:11:36,794 --> 01:11:37,966
You're blind!

1645
01:11:38,029 --> 01:11:40,839
You've been with him eight
years, and what do you have?

1646
01:11:40,899 --> 01:11:43,038
You're going to end
UP With nothing!

1647
01:11:43,101 --> 01:11:45,513
No house, no job, no money!

1648
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:46,742
Nothing!

1649
01:11:50,675 --> 01:11:53,417
This is my decision. Not Matt's,
not yours. Mine.

1650
01:11:58,616 --> 01:11:59,924
Stubborn!

1651
01:12:13,264 --> 01:12:16,006
This is gonna' bring us some
serious FU money, you guys.

1652
01:12:16,067 --> 01:12:17,410
You're damn right.

1653
01:12:17,468 --> 01:12:19,106
What's FU money?

1654
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:20,547
Fuck-you money.

1655
01:12:20,605 --> 01:12:22,107
Wouldn't that be FY?

1656
01:12:22,173 --> 01:12:23,915
FY, Bean.

1657
01:12:24,976 --> 01:12:25,920
Who needs a hug?

1658
01:12:25,977 --> 01:12:32,223
Come here.

1659
01:12:32,283 --> 01:12:33,489
Yeah!

1660
01:12:33,551 --> 01:12:35,588
One hundred and
eighty-four cartons.

1661
01:12:35,653 --> 01:12:36,996
Five thousand openers.

1662
01:12:37,055 --> 01:12:38,125
Woo-hoo!!

1663
01:12:38,189 --> 01:12:40,999
Hey, guys, what's
a Talking Beer Opener?

1664
01:12:41,059 --> 01:12:46,133
Allow my
assistant to demonstrate.

1665
01:12:46,197 --> 01:12:49,303
International Gifts
presents.

1666
01:12:49,367 --> 01:12:50,505
What's it say?

1667
01:12:50,568 --> 01:12:55,017
The Talking Beer Opener.

1668
01:12:55,073 --> 01:12:56,416
>> Oh yeah!

1669
01:12:56,474 --> 01:12:58,097
>> Time for a beer!

1670
01:13:00,645 --> 01:13:01,783
Oh, that's pretty good!

1671
01:13:01,846 --> 01:13:03,553
I've never seen
that before, man!

1672
01:13:03,615 --> 01:13:06,789
But why didn't you guys use a
man's voice like,

1673
01:13:06,851 --> 01:13:09,832
"Oh yeah!
Time for a beer!"

1674
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:10,365
Yeah, really?

1675
01:13:10,421 --> 01:13:11,491
Really??

1676
01:13:11,556 --> 01:13:13,058
>> Oh yeah!

1677
01:13:13,124 --> 01:13:14,102
>> Time for a beer!

1678
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:14,693
Shit!

1679
01:13:14,759 --> 01:13:16,500
Checking them!

1680
01:13:16,561 --> 01:13:17,699
Damn it!

1681
01:13:20,732 --> 01:13:22,010
Check them! Check them!

1682
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:23,879
Check them!

1683
01:13:27,973 --> 01:13:29,513
Alvin and the
fucking Chipmunks!

1684
01:13:29,574 --> 01:13:33,078
Can't catch a break!

1685
01:13:33,144 --> 01:13:34,145
No, I tested them all.

1686
01:13:34,212 --> 01:13:35,452
They're all bad!

1687
01:13:35,513 --> 01:13:36,583
Listen to it!

1688
01:13:36,648 --> 01:13:37,558
>> Oh yeah!

1689
01:13:37,615 --> 01:13:38,252
>> Time for a beer!

1690
01:13:38,316 --> 01:13:39,454
Okay?

1691
01:13:39,517 --> 01:13:41,497
So I mean, what are we gonna'
do about this, Mr. Chow?

1692
01:13:41,552 --> 01:13:43,361
Well, you send the
defective ones back,

1693
01:13:43,421 --> 01:13:44,866
we'll check them out,
see what the problem is.

1694
01:13:44,922 --> 01:13:46,060
No, no, absolutely not.

1695
01:13:46,124 --> 01:13:47,797
You fix the problem
right now!

1696
01:13:47,859 --> 01:13:50,232
I need samples and stock
available right away

1697
01:13:50,294 --> 01:13:51,471
for the L.A. Gift Expo!

1698
01:13:51,529 --> 01:13:52,098
Let me talk to him.

1699
01:13:52,163 --> 01:13:52,766
Shut up!

1700
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:53,535
Absolutely not!

1701
01:13:53,598 --> 01:13:56,272
You got to
get over there.

1702
01:13:56,334 --> 01:13:58,746
I can get you a pass.

1703
01:14:25,425 --> 01:14:28,065
Well, let's see what
the problem is.

1704
01:14:28,128 --> 01:14:30,505
>> Oh yeah!
>> Time for a beer!

1705
01:14:30,563 --> 01:14:32,201
We can put a
gold resistor here,

1706
01:14:32,264 --> 01:14:34,141
stabilize the recording rate.

1707
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,874
Yes.

1708
01:14:36,936 --> 01:14:38,711
Put in a bigger speaker,
right?

1709
01:14:38,771 --> 01:14:39,977
Make it louder.

1710
01:14:40,039 --> 01:14:41,177
Great, great.

1711
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:45,848
How quickly can we get,
say, 10 dozen?

1712
01:14:45,911 --> 01:14:47,891
Well, we can work hard.

1713
01:14:47,947 --> 01:14:49,153
Have it by tomorrow morning.

1714
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:50,592
Huh, great!

1715
01:14:55,321 --> 01:14:57,597
Quality control,
sound testing,

1716
01:14:57,657 --> 01:15:00,200
100%.
No more problems.

1717
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,335
That's excellent, Mr. Chow.

1718
01:15:03,395 --> 01:15:05,630
We... we're going to need
the rest of the order shipped

1719
01:15:05,631 --> 01:15:08,271
air freight at your expense,
so we can have openers in the store

1720
01:15:08,334 --> 01:15:09,938
right after the Expo.

1721
01:15:10,002 --> 01:15:12,175
The customer always
pays for the shipping.

1722
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:17,586
Yes, but this was
your fault, Mr. Chow.

1723
01:15:17,643 --> 01:15:19,987
Well, maybe
some air freight.

1724
01:15:20,046 --> 01:15:21,923
We share the cost, yes?

1725
01:15:21,981 --> 01:15:23,892
I'll tell you, the
sooner my customers get these,

1726
01:15:23,949 --> 01:15:25,895
the sooner you get a reorder.

1727
01:15:25,951 --> 01:15:29,956
...Tsing-Tao!

1728
01:15:30,022 --> 01:15:31,365
What are they saying?

1729
01:15:31,424 --> 01:15:33,461
Uh, yes!
"Time for Tsing-Tao!"

1730
01:15:33,526 --> 01:15:34,937
China's most popular beer.

1731
01:15:34,994 --> 01:15:37,497
I see.

1732
01:16:32,618 --> 01:16:34,154
What time is it?

1733
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:38,999
10 minutes to noon.

1734
01:16:39,058 --> 01:16:41,937
You ready?

1735
01:16:41,994 --> 01:16:46,500
This is it, here we go.

1736
01:16:47,633 --> 01:16:49,112
It's like
the guy said once,

1737
01:16:49,168 --> 01:16:50,841
"Everything that's loose in
this country

1738
01:16:50,903 --> 01:16:53,383
eventually rolls to L.A.

1739
01:16:53,439 --> 01:16:55,180
And they were all there.

1740
01:16:55,241 --> 01:16:58,654
From the Mom and Pop
stores to the big chains.

1741
01:16:58,711 --> 01:17:01,055
This is the biggest
trade show of the year."

1742
01:17:01,313 --> 01:17:03,691
Would you like to see
a talking beer opener?

1743
01:17:03,749 --> 01:17:06,753
That's right,
check it out right here.

1744
01:17:06,819 --> 01:17:08,799
Talk to her, she'll
make it happen, right here.

1745
01:17:08,854 --> 01:17:09,423
That's right.

1746
01:17:09,488 --> 01:17:10,228
Come on over.

1747
01:17:10,289 --> 01:17:10,733
Hey, guys.

1748
01:17:10,789 --> 01:17:11,790
Check it out.

1749
01:17:19,498 --> 01:17:21,671
Happy Hour
just got happier!

1750
01:17:21,734 --> 01:17:24,010
Let me talk to you about the
sexiest openers...

1751
01:17:24,069 --> 01:17:25,548
Excuse
me, can I buy a sample?

1752
01:17:25,604 --> 01:17:27,948
My husband is a
talking beer opener.

1753
01:17:28,007 --> 01:17:29,111
Hi.

1754
01:17:29,174 --> 01:17:29,652
Toys For Men.

1755
01:17:29,708 --> 01:17:30,846
Escondido.

1756
01:17:30,909 --> 01:17:32,286
Oh, yeah, that's
near San Diego, yeah?

1757
01:17:32,344 --> 01:17:32,947
Yeah, right.

1758
01:17:33,012 --> 01:17:34,685
Three stores, actually.

1759
01:17:34,747 --> 01:17:36,727
And let me tell you, it's so
hard to find gifts for men.

1760
01:17:36,782 --> 01:17:38,013
You walk this show,
any show,

1761
01:17:38,014 --> 01:17:39,885
it's women's gifts,
women's gifts.

1762
01:17:39,886 --> 01:17:41,126
And then finally I
stumble on you guys.

1763
01:17:41,187 --> 01:17:45,602
You know, I'll take...
what's 3 times 72?

1764
01:17:46,658 --> 01:17:47,762
216.

1765
01:17:48,326 --> 01:17:50,397
Yeah, 216.

1766
01:17:50,462 --> 01:17:52,533
You can write it up.

1767
01:17:52,598 --> 01:17:54,942
These are great.

1768
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:55,705
Love it.

1769
01:17:55,768 --> 01:17:57,076
All right, thank you.

1770
01:18:18,791 --> 01:18:21,738
Jesus, Larry,
look what's going on!

1771
01:18:21,794 --> 01:18:22,844
Are those
the two schmucks

1772
01:18:22,845 --> 01:18:24,430
that came to our office?

1773
01:18:24,496 --> 01:18:25,201
Yeah.

1774
01:18:25,264 --> 01:18:27,301
Guaranteed one show wonders.

1775
01:18:27,366 --> 01:18:28,538
My, my, my-

1776
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,273
They're getting quite a crowd.

1777
01:18:30,335 --> 01:18:33,282
Yeah, but it's
not a product for TV.

1778
01:18:33,338 --> 01:18:35,746
Too cheap, $7 retail?

1779
01:18:35,908 --> 01:18:37,746
Got to be
$19.95 for TV.

1780
01:18:37,810 --> 01:18:40,086
That's the magic price.

1781
01:18:40,145 --> 01:18:43,126
If it's not on TV,
who gives a shit, right?

1782
01:18:43,182 --> 01:18:44,718
Hey, Newkin!

1783
01:18:44,783 --> 01:18:46,160
How 'bout you, man?

1784
01:18:46,218 --> 01:18:48,323
How 'bout you?

1785
01:18:48,387 --> 01:18:51,891
what an asshole.

1786
01:19:02,968 --> 01:19:05,881
Bye now.

1787
01:19:05,938 --> 01:19:06,516
What was that?

1788
01:19:06,572 --> 01:19:08,576
Repartee,
a gift store in Portland,

1789
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,881
ordered at the show,
showed the flyer to a customer,

1790
01:19:10,943 --> 01:19:13,010
who just ordered 250

1791
01:19:13,011 --> 01:19:14,987
for a wedding reception.

1792
01:19:20,053 --> 01:19:21,663
That's exciting, isn't it?

1793
01:19:21,721 --> 01:19:22,999
You know,
we've got this going,

1794
01:19:23,055 --> 01:19:23,790
but now we got
to keep it going.

1795
01:19:24,356 --> 01:19:26,199
I was thinking we got to
diversify the brands,

1796
01:19:26,258 --> 01:19:27,396
come up with new ideas.

1797
01:19:27,459 --> 01:19:29,302
I was thinking, I don't know,
maybe The Three Stooges?

1798
01:19:29,361 --> 01:19:30,169
I love Curly.

1799
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:31,640
Woo-woo-woo-woo!

1800
01:19:32,197 --> 01:19:34,974
What about,
"Mmmm, beer."

1801
01:19:35,534 --> 01:19:37,275
Homer.

1802
01:19:37,336 --> 01:19:39,407
"Mmmm, beer!"

1803
01:19:47,473 --> 01:19:49,121
"Oh Yes"
"Woo-hoo!"

1804
01:19:49,281 --> 01:19:50,282
Matt, Craig's on two!

1805
01:19:50,349 --> 01:19:53,956
Tell him we've just moved in,
we need 3 more phone lines.

1806
01:19:54,019 --> 01:19:55,760
What about that stuff
going to Australia?

1807
01:19:55,821 --> 01:19:57,494
How about that
order going to Australia?

1808
01:19:57,556 --> 01:20:00,127
Brenda, hold my calls!

1809
01:20:01,759 --> 01:20:02,133
>> Yes!

1810
01:20:02,194 --> 01:20:03,138
>> Oh, yes!

1811
01:20:03,195 --> 01:20:04,503
>> Woo-hoo!

1812
01:20:04,504 --> 01:20:07,601
(In Spanish) >> ...Homer Simpson!
(CER-VEZA ... beer)

1813
01:20:07,666 --> 01:20:12,706
(In Japanese)
>> ...Homer Simpson...!

1814
01:20:12,771 --> 01:20:16,810
(In Norwegian)
>> ...Homer Simpson!

1815
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:19,151
Take two,
Talking Beer Opener.

1816
01:20:19,211 --> 01:20:20,315
A beer, sir?
(Cerveza, senor?)

1817
01:20:20,379 --> 01:20:22,359
Yes, Corona!
(Si, Corona!)

1818
01:20:22,414 --> 01:20:25,020
Oh, you speak Spanish.
(Oh, habla Espanol.)

1819
01:20:25,083 --> 01:20:27,529
Yes, Corona!
(Si, Corona.)

1820
01:20:27,586 --> 01:20:29,156
Nice!
(Bueno!)

1821
01:20:34,493 --> 01:20:36,029
Yeah!

1822
01:20:40,299 --> 01:20:42,336
I'm really
happy for Gina.

1823
01:20:42,401 --> 01:20:45,007
She finally got that
casita she always wanted,

1824
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:48,574
bought it all by herself.

1825
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,244
Sam gave her a plaque to put
over the door

1826
01:20:50,309 --> 01:20:52,949
that said "Casa de Homer".

1827
01:20:53,011 --> 01:20:55,150
Her sister Louisa
was horrified.

1828
01:20:55,214 --> 01:20:56,192
Hi, Sam.

1829
01:20:56,248 --> 01:20:57,022
Hey, Sam.

1830
01:20:57,082 --> 01:20:58,356
How are you doing?

1831
01:21:27,481 --> 01:21:28,118
Hey-

1832
01:21:28,181 --> 01:21:29,285
All right, guys.

1833
01:21:29,349 --> 01:21:33,092
Gina, to making your new
house a home, sister!

1834
01:21:33,153 --> 01:21:34,632
Here here!

1835
01:22:05,217 --> 01:22:06,339
Hi.

1836
01:22:07,886 --> 01:22:09,365
The place looks great.

1837
01:22:09,421 --> 01:22:11,560
Thanks.

1838
01:22:11,623 --> 01:22:14,020
Yeah, a guy could
get used to living here.

1839
01:22:15,861 --> 01:22:18,098
I don't know, Matt.

1840
01:22:18,163 --> 01:22:19,540
I don't

1841
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:35,155
Gina, seriously.

1842
01:22:38,216 --> 01:22:42,562
Okay, I got an idea.

1843
01:22:42,621 --> 01:22:45,158
You got a flashlight?

1844
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:31,039
I'm not crazy, am I?

1845
01:23:31,103 --> 01:23:32,912
"I know he's a little off.

1846
01:23:32,971 --> 01:23:35,042
Yes, but that's why
you liked him right now.

1847
01:23:35,107 --> 01:23:38,850
That's what I always
love about him."

1848
01:23:47,452 --> 01:23:51,491
Yes.

1848
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:59,705
