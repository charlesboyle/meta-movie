Somewhere, are they safe?

685
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:14,701
When I was a kid, like 6 or 7...

686
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:17,495
...I used to worry so much
about my parents dying.

687
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,457
Lying awake at night just worrying.

01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,918
Yeah, well, most kids do, I guess.

Most kids never have it happen.

690
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:34,512
When I was 10,
my dad went into a 7-Eleven for cigarettes.

691
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,182
I guess that he heard someone say,
"Don't turn around."

692
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,685
So on reflex, or thinking
it was a friend joking, he did.

693
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,647
And the guy blew his head off.

694
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,192
Life became shit after that.

695
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:50,904

She married this asshole...

697

...who my mom with my real dad would
have crossed the street to avoid this guy.

698
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:01,873
He really didn't want a kid.
So my mom didn't either anymore.

699
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:07,963
If that was the design
for my father and my family...

that night and just kept driving.

704

and my dad are still together...
