this is the best special

like a bunch of cupcakes.

take down three of their geezers

00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:41,951
I'll have a shower. Whoops.

353
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:45,872
He slips on the shampoo, hits the
corner of the step with his occiput.

354
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,291
Case closed. Get out of it.

355
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,793
You boys are going
about this all wrong.

356
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:52,420
That bird he's screwing
is married.

357
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,007
Why don't we just pop 'em both and
make it look like her husband did it.

358
00:27:56,091 --> 00:28:00,595
Pop 'em both? What's she ever done?
It's Harris we're after.

359
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,097
Poor bastard.

360
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,726
Ten years after the war, he cops it for
doing something he was ordered to do.

361
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,686
He knew what he was doing
when he joined the club.

362
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,938
Yeah, what club?
The killing club.

363
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,150
It could be you or me.
Yeah, but it's not...

364
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,277
I'm just glad
I never killed a raghead.

365
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,196
No offense, my son.

366
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,447
Let's get this done.

367
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,533
MEIER: Excuse my friend.
He's a royal asshole.

368
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:33,419
Shit!

369
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:44,138
DAVIES: Where's he gonna run?
It's the middle of the fuckin' desert.

370
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:48,142
Son of a...

371
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,821
Meier, cut him off at the next shaft!
Let's go, let's go.

372
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:06,702
Where is he?

373
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,125
Shh.

374
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:48,202
(GRUNTING)

375
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:51,247
DAVIES: Let's get out here.
Fuckin' hell!

376
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,380
MEIER: So what, now
somebody's on our ass?

377
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:00,673
DANNY: We should move
right away.

378
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,592
We'll set up Harris'
interview for tomorrow.

379
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:05,011
Davies, you make sure
his girl doesn't show.

380
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,345
She has nothing
to do with this.

381
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,191
(CLICKING)

382
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,073
Wanker!

383
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,711
DANNY: We're military historians.
I'll do the talking, all right?

384
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,131
Well, it's 5:00 somewhere,
isn't it?

385
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,218
So where's this documentary
gonna be shown, then?

386
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:46,302
On the telly?

387
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
The chair.

388
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,812
Those bastards in C Company
put this together. Hmm?

389
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,981
(LAUGHING)

390
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,467
HARRIS: What's the matter?
They didn't like sand in their burgers?

391
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,010
Eh?

392
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:31,305
Hello, boys. I'm not saying a
word till I see my lawyer.

393
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,267
Think back. The village of Qum.

394
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,936
You killed
a guerilla commander.

395
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:40,773
His name was Hussain bin Amr.
Do you admit it?

396
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,488
Fuck off!

397
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,282
You're kidding, right?

398
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,866
You commanded a company there.

399
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:55,997
Yeah, I led a company
on that op, sure.

400
00:31:56,331 --> 00:32:00,001
And you assassinated Hussain bin Amr.
There were witnesses.

401
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,504
You dropped him
in front of his family.

402
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:04,880
(DISTANT SCREAMING)

403
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:11,721
All right, you got me.
I did it. Hmm?

404
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,890
Fuck you! Good one.
Now untie me.

405
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:16,851
Get up.

406
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,020
Hey! Piss off!

407
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,522
We have what we need.

408
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:22,815
(PANTING)

409
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,402
What if I told you somebody else
dropped your guerilla commander?

410
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,071
His name is...

411
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,699
I can't remember.

412
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,202
But he's writing a book
about the whole Oman gig.

413
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,079
You might find it in there.

414
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,873
If you could read. (LAUGHS)

415
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:40,958
To the bathroom.

416
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:44,420
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

417
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,631
It's coming back to me,
looking at your fucking face.

418
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:51,927
His name is Captain R.
Sole! A-R-S-E H-O-L-E.

419
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:54,055
Shut up.
You're fucking dead, yeah?

420
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:55,931
On your knees.

421
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,061
Fucking queers!
Serves you fucking right!

422
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,814
Head down. Get your fuckin'
hands off me, you queer!

423
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,858
You're fuckin' kidding me.
DANNY: Hold him still.

424
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,611
If I find you, I'll put your
fuckin' head in the toilet bowl.

425
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,737
Poor fucker.

426
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,072
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

427
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,075
(GRUNTING)

428
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,415
Jay!

429
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:26,253
I need money for the taxi.
I had to take a taxi. I had a flat.

430
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,396
HARRIS: Fuck you! (SCREAMS)

431
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,281
Case closed.

432
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,000
Thank you.

433
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,843
WOMAN OVER RADIO: Tells of a
dramatic 12-hour rescue operation

434
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,970
to save the crew
of Radio Caroline.

435
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:18,055
The pirate radio
ship sank the...

436
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,728
It seems your friend
did what you couldn't.

437
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,648
Wouldn't.

438
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,066
Wouldn't, couldn't.

439
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,152
He's avenged Hussain.

440
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,653
Good news for the old man,
not for you.

441
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:34,655
What do you mean?

442
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,991
Three brothers dead.
Rotting in the sand.

443
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,327
You didn't wanna get
revenge yourself?

444
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,705
Scared of getting
your hands dirty?

445
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,583
Better get used to it.

446
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,170
No palace where you're going.
A tent and a hole to shit in.

447
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,715
He's your worst nightmare
and he's gonna do it.

448
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,219
And when he does,
you're out of here.

449
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,433
When I find you in that desert,
I pray God keeps my aim...

450
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,688
true.

451
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,033
(HAMMERING)

452
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,287
Well, what do you think?

453
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,413
Yeah, it's coming along.

454
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,879
What are you doing
for New Year's Eve dinner?

455
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,964
Oh, shit!

456
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,090
(LAUGHS)

457
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,680
DANNY: Bollocks!

458
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:47,728
Strangers are a bit of an
exotic thing around here.

459
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,688
Oh, come on, I didn't
think I was a stranger.

460
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,232
I know,
but you're still exotic.

461
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,069
Danny, something tells me
you've got a story to tell.

462
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:57,363
Yeah. Mmm.

463
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:58,906
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

(GUNSHOTS)

465
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,793
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

466
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:12,253
Party's outside.

467
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,297
MAN: Happy New Year!

468
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,216
(PEOPLE CHEERING)

469
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,053
Happy New Year!

470
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,181
It's a tradition around here.

471
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,433
Happy New Year!

472
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,169
Shit!

473
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,396
Mirbat. The artist's
name is on the back.

474
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,482
Have them talk to him.

475
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,152
One more thing.

476
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,071
My boys had some
trouble in Oman.

477
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,323
Somebody was tailing them.

478
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,575
We'll have to have a look
into that, won't we?

479
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:27,286
Yeah.

480
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:40,341
Ah, that's how you get it
so lifelike, then. Sorry?

481
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,677
Photos of the lads.
Isn't that like cheating?

482
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,972
I'm recreating an historical event.
Accuracy is everything.

483
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,098
Mmm.

484
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,893
That Mirbat painting stopped
me cold when I saw it.

485
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:51,977
You were at Mirbat?

486
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:53,187
Had a mate there.

487
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,981
I was hoping you might
have an address for him.

488
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,608
You're with the SAS? Was.

489
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,654
Then your best bet for an address
would be Regimental Association...

490
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,447
They won't talk to me.

491
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,033
Spent the last few years
plying my trade overseas.

492
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,409
Angola and that.

493
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,495
I come to you unofficial like.

494
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,372
Ah.

495
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:16,043
Well, I might have
something somewhere.

496
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:18,420
Just give me a few minutes.

497
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:19,713
Be my guest.

498
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,230
I got a bullshitter
askin' about Mirbat.

499
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,816
Yeah. He claims
he's with the regiment.

500
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,567
No, there's no way he was SAS.

501
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:44,738
Yeah, I can smell it off him.
Ah, he's a bloody fake.

502
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:49,702
(SCREAMING)

503
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,250
(GRUNTING)

504
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,098
My contact says
the call was cut off,

505
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,018
but Gowling said that there was
somebody there asking about Mirbat.

506
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,853
It has to be our guy.

507
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,813
And what would you
have us do about it?

508
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,148
Find him.

509
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:22,359
If we don't, there's gonna be another murder
and it will be one of our Mirbat boys.

510
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:23,777
Then who are they?

511
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,154
Well, they're pros for sure.

512
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,031
If these guys are
going after the SAS,

513
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,283
they're gonna be top-class
professional assassins.

514
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,702
They must have a string
of hits behind them

515
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,787
but they're completely
under the radar.

516
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:35,539
All we've got is Oman.

517
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:36,749
Oman?

518
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,333
We all know
our people went too far.

519
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:41,378
Oman, Mirbat.
It all needs to be left alone.

520
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:42,963
You should try telling
that to the Welshman.

521
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,216
He's right.

522
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:49,136
We have to find this phony
Welshman and his group.

523
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,182
DAVIES: The file says
an SAS officer

524
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,142
killed the Sheikh's son

DANNY: That him?
DAVIES: That's him.

703
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,209
Major Simon McCann.

704
00:54:56,669 --> 00:55:00,338
Served in the Sultan's forces till
he was pensioned out four years ago.

705
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,173
And another.

706
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:04,509
Oi!

707
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:05,760
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

708
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,845
Piss off, grandpa.
You want some?

DANNY: Doesn't look
like an invalid.

712
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:18,439
Like I said, a bomb went off under
his jeep, scrambled his wiring.

713
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:20,233
He can't keep a job.

714
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:21,901
He's a fucking psycho.

Come on, mate, that's enough.

718
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:32,912
What's he doing here?

719
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:37,333
That's the one I went head-to-head
with at the hospital.

720
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:43,840
Right.

721
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,008
Wait, wait, wait.

722

skinheads off my doorstep.

726
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:40,688
All right, mate.

727
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:42,648

AGENT: His name's Spike Logan.

731
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,915
He's an ex-soldier
of some kind.

732
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:02,835
He got his eye shot out
playing a hero somewhere.

733
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:06,172
He's got no job
and he keeps odd hours.

734
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:08,049
Hmm.

your bread and butter.

737

Don't worry about it.

738
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:17,183
I do worry about it.
You should, too.

739

Every move my guys make,
these lot are waiting.

740

You ask me,

741
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:25,066
I think it's time you put those fancy
shoes of yours on a few throats.

742
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:28,194
Yes. But no one is asking you.

743
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:36,494
DAVIES: You'll be interviewing for
a security position, Mr. McCann.

744
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:37,745
McCANN: Right.

745
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:40,289
Actually we got your name from
a mutual friend in the SAS.

746
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,874
Yeah, really?

the 17th, at 10:00.

Okay. We look forward to it.

749
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,256
See you then.
All right, my son.

750
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:51,217
He'll be there.

751
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,553
Good. I don't get it.

752
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:57,098
McCann lives here.

753
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:00,643
He'll be here for the
interview, Tuesday at 10:00.

754
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:03,062
He'll take this road.

755
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,023
The Boston Brakes. Perfect.

756
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:07,567
They weren't perfect in Boston.

757
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:08,901
I wasn't at the controls.

758
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,069
We've got 10 days.

759
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:11,362
MEIER: Ten days?

760
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:12,905
The quicker we get
this done, the better.

761
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:14,740
I'm going to need
to bring in some help.

762
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,659
Okay. DAVIES: "Okay.
" Just like that?

763
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,078
McCann's being watched.

764
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:20,913
How are you gonna get a
confession out of him?

765
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:21,998
We aren't.

766
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:23,374
We'll fake it.

767
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:25,293
Bit of bad lighting
and camera work,

768
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,919
you could be him.

769
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:30,464
What we'll do is play back what
he admitted to in the reports.

770
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:48,608
Who are you?

771
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,944
I'm the one they let fly around in an
unmarked chopper with a gun in my pocket.

772
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:54,864
You can call me MFWIC. "MFWIC"?

00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,785

About this little illegal club
of yours, The Feather Men.

Your attack dog,

777
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:08,002
time to bring him to heel, eh?

778
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,466
And then we'll put that
on the agenda.

We'll be with you in a minute.

781

I want to put Locals on Major
McCann around the clock.

782
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:30,316
I realize McCann is an old friend of
yours, but what has it to do with us?

783
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:36,739
But this is our chance to get the
bastards who killed Cregg and Harris.

784
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:40,117
The authorities found no evidence
of foul play in either case.

785
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:41,494
What are you talking about,
"No evidence?"

786
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,162
I've got the evidence
right here.

787
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:50,670
Everybody in this room knows
that those men were killed.

788
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:54,173
Everybody knows that McCann
is going to be next.

789
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:56,592
That's enough, Spike.
We have to do something.

790
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:57,969
THE DON: Well, we could
put it to the vote.

791
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,179
Yes, but that would require
the full committee.

792
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:02,974
And it will have to wait.

793
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:21,200
Spike. That was a set-up.

794
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:23,744
He sent him away.
He knew there'd be a vote.

795
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:26,205

796
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:28,207

reputations to protect.

799

I'm not doing this
to protect reputations.

touch is one thing,

801
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:40,594
but no touch at all?
I can't do this.

up for maximum deniability?

who knows the Locals.

All their orders
come through you.

805
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:48,769
So?

806
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:51,230
So? If this comes out,

807
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:53,232
you're the one
who takes the fall.

808
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:55,776
Fall? From where?

809
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:59,155

whole committee thing.

810
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:01,907

don't worry.

bring his mom on the job?

for a day afterwards.

the way the army likes them.

Bring him to me.

You got him, man. You got him!

Give me an update, Davies.

Up here there's a yard.
Take a left.

Davies, where the fuck are you?

887
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:12,301

do you guys come from?

894
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:31,820
Step away from the car. Easy.

Jake. Yeah?

896
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:34,907
Take it easy. Check the car.

01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:40,847
I'll be waiting.

1405
01:48:47,396 --> 01:48:49,189
We'll call you a cab
from the airport.

1406
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:10,460
Hey.

1407
01:49:12,129 --> 01:49:13,129
Aren't you Anne Frazer?

1408
01:49:13,923 --> 01:49:15,173
The girl with those
weird gumboots?

1409
01:49:18,052 --> 01:49:20,345
Are you Danny Bryce,
the boy who went away?

1410
01:49:20,429 --> 01:49:21,888
Yeah.

1411
01:49:21,972 --> 01:49:23,264
I'm back.

1412
01:49:23,349 --> 01:49:24,432
Where you headed?

1413
01:49:26,268 --> 01:49:27,644
I don't know.

1414
01:49:27,728 --> 01:49:28,728
Me, neither.

1415
01:49:29,355 --> 01:49:30,480
Want to come along?
