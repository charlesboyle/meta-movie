1
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:13,082
People ask me, "Carole, how do you and
Bruce keep the spice in your marriage?"

2
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,665
Well, I tell them
it's really simple.

3
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:19,749
I'm just the ultimate tease.

4
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,582
Me and Bruce,
we're not that different.

5
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,499
We know what we want

6
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:28,082
We know how to get it.

7
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,457
Like this promotion he's going for.
We both know he'll win.

8
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,582
And when he does,

9
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,499
the Robertson household

10
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:41,165
is gonna be one big
happy family again.

11
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,290
I kid you not.

12
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,540
Jimmy!

13
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:02,749
Whoo-hoo!

14
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,165
What did you just fucking call me?

15
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,540
Just give us your money, mate.

16
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,040
Fucking hurry up!

17
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,790
Fucking...

18
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,665
Scatter.

19
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,665
Scotland.

20
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:03,665
This nation brought the world
television, the steam engine, golf,

21
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,999
whisky, penicillin and, of
course, the deep fried Mars bar.

22
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:15,749
It is great being Scottish. We're
such a uniquely successful race.

23
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,582
And as my wife Carole always says,

24
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,415
"There's no place like home."

25
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,999
Nice one. All right, pal?

26
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:56,207
The games are always,
repeat, always, being played

27
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,290
but nobody plays the games like me,

28
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,499
Detective Sergeant Bruce Robertson,

29
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,582
soon to be
Detective Inspector Bruce Robertson.

30
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:07,665
You just have to be the
best, and I usually am.

31
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,999
Same rules apply.

32
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,665
What the fuck?

33
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,165
Morning.

34
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,374
Right.

35
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:40,207
Our victim is a Japanese male

36
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,874
in his early 20s... Yes, Peter?

37
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,624
Sorry, boss, just a wee point.

38
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:48,332
Maybe we shouldn't stigmatise the guy
by calling him a victim.

39
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,499
Poor wee chinky bastard's dead.
Doesn't matter what you call him now.

40
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,957
Care to share the
joke with us, Dougie?

41
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,957
Dougie Gillman
is your average Scottish copper.

42
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:03,665
Sixty years ago in the glorious fucking
Reich, you'd be turned into handbags!

43
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:08,707
At 5/1, Gillman poses a serious
challenge to my promotion prospects.

44
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:12,082
So he, like the others,
will have to be eliminated,

45
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:16,707
starting with my main rival
for the inspector's job, Peter Inglis.

46
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,624
Inglis is what they
call metrosexual...

47
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,665
but what I call a fucking bufty.
2/1.

48
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,124
There was no positive ID,

49
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,290
but DS Lennox has been
down at the murder scene.

50
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:38,082
Ray Lennox, the department's
rookie and resident junkie.

51
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,124
I love the chang!

52
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:44,457
Even though Lennox is more interested
in trying to bang the office secretary

53
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:48,999
than any kind of career advancement,
he'll still have to be publicly humiliated.

54
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,249
20/1.

55
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,207
Official policy at the moment is...

56
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,124
Yes, Gus?

57
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,124
What is the party line, boss?

58
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:00,999
Gus Bain, bit of a long shot because
he's not the sharpest tool in the box.

59
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:04,207
I've got a new toothbrush, miss!

60
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:08,207
But then, when did a single-figure IQ
hold anybody back in the police force?

61
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,415
7/1.

62
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:13,207
In accordance with the description
which Detective Drummond

63
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,499
will presently hand out to you.

64
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,457
- Thanks, Bob.
- "Thanks, Bob."

65
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,290
That arse-kissing Amanda Drummond

66
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,540
would suck Toal off right now
if he promoted her.

67
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,415
Not that it would do her
any good, of course,

68
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,957
because some sad wanker from uniform
is gonna impregnate the wee slag

69
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:31,249
and that'll be her stint at playing Cagney
and fucking Lacey well and truly over.

70
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,790
10/1.

71
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:36,707
The umbilical cord
that connects the north and south...

72
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:42,207
Umbilical cord? The last time I looked
it was a tunnel, you fucking clown.

73
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:46,124
Edinburgh's worst kept secret is
that Chief Inspector Bob Toal here

74
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,124
has ambitions as a screenwriter.

75
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,999
If that lazy, fat fucker spent
less time dreaming about Hollywood

76
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:57,790
and more time promoting me, then the
streets would be safer for everybody.

77
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,915
And they left him there,
lying like a pile of rubbish.

78
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,415
- Maybe he was rubbish.
- What?

79
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,540
To the assailants, of course.

80
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,332
Aye, that's it. Your docile
chat might impress the boss,

81
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,332
but it doesn't impress
my fucking hangover.

82
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,332
I have got news for
this herd of donkeys.

83
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:18,040
There is only one horse can win this race and
that horse is Bruce the Stallion Robertson.

84
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,124
Right, crack on with it.

85
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,332
- Quick word, Bruce.
- Yes, boss?

86
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,499
Things are pretty stretched around here
until we get the new DI position filled.

87
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:34,207
I want you to head up the case. I'll be
around, but I'll be tied up with other stuff.

88
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:38,832
So, you'll effectively be acting inspector,
without the remuneration of course.

89
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,165
All leave, unfortunately,
will be cancelled,

90
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,749
but it'll stand you
in good stead for the promotion

91
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:48,082
because you'll have
the other contenders under you.

92
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:58,707
There's really nothing more seductive
to a woman than power.

93
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:04,124
So, when Bruce gets his promotion,

94
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,999
I won't be able to
keep my hands off him.

95
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:11,624
Detective Inspector Robertson.

96
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,790
Even the sound of it
makes me want him right now.

97
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,665
Are you not worried
if you bugger off to Hamburg

98
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,832
it'll go against you for
the promotion then?

99
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,290
- Promotion?
- Aye.

100
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,040
What's the alternative, Ray?

101
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:29,832
I give up my holidays for some murdered Jap,
kamikaze, sushi-eating, karaoke bastard?

102
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,082
No chance.

103
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,999
Well, you do have a very
understanding wife in Carole, Robbo.

104
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,624
Aye. Aye, that I do.

105
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:40,415
- I wish I had somebody like that.
- I bet you do, Ray. I bet you do.

106
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,457
Tell you what, we'll have to get you
another threesome organised

107
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,832
with that wee skanky dealer's bird,
won't we? Do you remember that?

108
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:52,624
Lennox hates to be reminded of the
time we went tag team on that thing.

109
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,290
Have you even started yet, baby cock?

110
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,249
Everybody has got an Achilles' heel

111
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:02,207
and I make a point
in remembering my associates' ones.

112
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,415
You were like an animal, Ray.

113
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,207
Oh, here we go. Here comes
the schemie wee bastard now.

114
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,374
Jesus Christ, look at the face
on that wee lassie.

115
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,290
That's a stoat-the-baw situation
if ever I saw one.

116
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,207
That's a curvy little
arse, though, mind.

117
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,082
Never you mind the curvy
little arse on it, Ray.

118
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,457
- It's a bit fucking young, no?
- Ah, she's borderline, man. Come on.

119
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,665
- Borderline?
- Aye.

120
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,082
Do you like wee lassies, Ray?
Are you into baldy fanny?

121
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,707
Borderline, is it?

122
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,249
40 sheets at 5/1 . Come on. 5/1?

123
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,999
Ah, no, maybe you're right.
You're right enough, man.

124
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,040
You have got
absolutely no bottle, Ray.

125
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:38,665
That is exactly why the Lennoxes of this
world will never oust the Robertsons.

126
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,165
I kid you not, my sweet, sweet friend.
Come on!

127
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,082
- Right then, what's the script?
- The Beast routine.

128
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,957
- It's a bit full-on, Robbo, no?
- You steam right in.

129
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:56,290
It's the only language these
schemies understand, OK? Come here.

130
00:09:56,375 --> 00:10:00,290
I want you to show this bastard who the
hardest firm in this city really is, OK?

131
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,165
Nobody... Nobody steams in
like the Edinburgh polis.

132
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,207
- Go.
- Right.

133
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:09,374
Wait two seconds. He'll be firing into
her and we'll catch the stoat in action.

134
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,374
- Another toot for good luck?
- I'm on duty.

135
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,290
Aye.

136
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,249
For God's sake, I'm coming!

137
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:27,374
- Who the fuck are you two?
- Jehovah's fucking Witnesses.

138
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,165
Keep your fucking mouth shut.
You hear me?

139
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,499
You speak when you're
fucking spoken to. You get it?

140
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,082
- I said, do you fucking get it?
- Aye, aye, aye!

141
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,665
- Get the fuck out!
- Oh, a lady.

142
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,582
How old are you then, madam?

143
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,874
My father's a very well
respected lawyer, you know.

144
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,415
What does that make me then?

145
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,999
Very good. How old are we?

146
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,874
- Sixteen.
- ID?

147
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,874
No, you don't.

148
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:57,040
Please note, female is below
the legal age of consent.

149
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,165
Stephanie Donaldson.

150
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,874
No relation to Conrad Donaldson QC
by any chance, are we?

151
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,540
Bingo.

152
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,290
Imagine what your daddy would say.

153
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,040
Please don't say anything.

154
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,124
What's it worth, Stephanie? A gam?

155
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,207
Can you imagine what his
posh pals would say

156
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:29,915
if they found out that his wee princess
was riding all the low-life scum

157
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,665
he gets paid fortunes for
to keep out the nick?

158
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,582
Do you want to do that to him?

159
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,624
Fucking hell! Jesus Christ!

160
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,415
Who taught you that technique?
A fucking cheesegrater?

161
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,790
I've got a good mind to tell your daddy now
anyway after that poor excuse of an attempt.

162
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,374
Please, don't.
That's not fucking fair!

163
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,040
- She told me she was 1 8.
- Oh, dearie, dearie me.

164
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,749
It's not the best time to be inside
for riding kids, is it?

165
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,874
I make you right. Still, he's
only gonna do six months.

166
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,415
- Ah, posh fanny, though.
- Fair enough. Two years then.

167
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,415
Problem is, if some law-abiding
officers were to tell a strict

168
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,540
- Freemason screw like Ronnie McArthur...
- Ronnie McArthur.

169
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,290
That the girl in
question was 11 or 10...

170
00:12:26,316 --> 00:12:27,440
Or even eight.

171
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,665
- Hey, come on, now, boys, eh?
- Aye, eight would do it.

172
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,832
Then the poor cunt's life
wouldn't be worth living, would it?

173
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,715
Straight to the Beast's
wing in Saughton nick.

174
00:12:33,741 --> 00:12:34,899
Aye, but hang on a minute.

175
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,124
Suppose this stoat-the-baw
had certain information

176
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,665
that could help the
law-abiding officers.

177
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,207
- With a murder enquiry.
- Ah, fuck sake.

178
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,457
Nah, I'm not a grasser.

179
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:49,249
Right, see, Ocky, there's this one guy in
the Beast's wing that they call The Beast.

180
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:53,040
- The Beast?
- No, no, no, no, not the Beast.

181
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,249
- The...
- ...Beast.

182
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,457
Shouldn't really be inside a
normal prison, to be fair.

183
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,040
No, but the last time
he escaped from a mental institution

184
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,665
the local livestock bore
the brunt of his frustrations.

185
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,848
Fucked a Highland cow
to death, so they say.

186
00:13:04,874 --> 00:13:07,065
Tore the horns clean
off the poor bastard.

187
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,749
Ronnie says the only way
they can keep The Beast quiet

188
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,957
is by putting a new model
in his cell every few weeks.

189
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,124
- A model?
- Aye.

190
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,249
That's what Ronnie and all the boys call
the fresh-faced laddies they send him.

191
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,457
- Supposed to be a big fucker as well.
- Fuck off.

192
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,832
You get your fucking hands off him
and you stand up straight.

193
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,415
6'4", full of muscle
and deaf as a post.

194
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,999
What's deaf got to do with it?

195
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,749
Cos he can't hear you
when you're screaming "no".

196
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,832
- Hung like a Derby winner, so Ronnie says.
- Aye.

197
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,540
Splits them all first
time without fail.

198
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,249
One thing's certain, you'd come out of
there with five new arseholes, pal.

199
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,457
That's if you ever do come out
after an experience like that.

200
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,082
So what's it gonna be, Ocky?

201
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,832
- Grass up?
- Or lock up?

202
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,832
There you go, pal.

203
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,124
You stop smoking, OK?

204
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,957
- Yes!
- That's it.

205
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,332
- That's it.
- Oh, yes!

206
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,832
That's it.
Turn off my gas, Carole. Go.

207
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,040
Go. Go! Go!

208
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,624
Oh, yes!

209
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,874
Did you really mean what you said
about falling in love with me?

210
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:31,040
You're a fucking cow,
do you know that?

211
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:36,749
We have been turning off the gas for each
other and you are a work mate's missus.

212
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,207
So, do you know what that makes you
in my book?

213
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,707
Do ya?
It makes you a fucking cow.

214
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,415
- Why are you being like this?
- Because... Because, darlin',

215
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,832
you let me in here and
you let me in there.

216
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:52,124
You don't let me in here.
And that's what love is.

217
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:56,665
What was all that? What was all that?
What was all that fucking good stuff, eh?

218
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,832
That was all just games, weren't it?
Sad, silly wee games.

219
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:03,165
A test if you will. A test which you
have sadly and miserably failed.

220
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:07,040
Why are you saying all this? And why
did you call me by your wife's name?

221
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,665
You said you loved me, not Carole.

222
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,665
I need you to take a good, long, hard think
about what feelings actually are, OK?

223
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,665
Because, if you want me to fix
your head, easy-peasy Japanesey,

224
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,540
but only you... only you can
get in touch with your heart.

225
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,999
- But, Bruce...
- If you want a fucking,

226
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,957
if you want a shagging
and a riding, I'm your man.

227
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:25,832
However, I've got to inform you, I find
all this just a little bit sordid.

228
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,540
And I can only imagine how much
this would hurt poor old Dougie

229
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,624
if he found out.
In his own fucking bed, Christ!

230
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,624
Bruce, please stay. We need to talk.

231
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,165
No! I am on a murder case here.

232
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,624
That's M-U-R-D-E-R,

233
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,457
which spells S-E-R-I-O-U-S.

234
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:47,540
So, if I don't get my A-R-S-E in G-E-A-R,
I am in serious S-H-I-T, OK?

235
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,374
You're being so cruel.

236
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,957
Love is cruel, Chrissie.

237
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,582
Love is cruel.

238
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,249
I think she's fucking somebody else
as well, Robbo.

239
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,499
No, no, no, no.

240
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:06,540
It's killing me because I can't even
prove it. Some detective me, eh?

241
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,749
Listen, listen, listen.

242
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,124
Your Chrissie is about
as loyal as they come.

243
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,832
- Ah, fuck off.
- Come on, now. Come on.

244
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,582
And cheer the fuck up.

245
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,832
You know you're the favourite
for the Chief Inspector position?

246
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,665
You reckon?

247
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,957
Hey, you're lucky. Carole's great.

248
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,374
She's a real beauty as well.

249
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,415
Aye. I'd say you're right on that.

250
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,832
- You two still as happy as ever?
- Couldn't be happier.

251
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,332
- How old's...
- Seven. Stacey's seven.

252
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,457
Stacey, aye.

253
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,540
- Here are the lads.
- Gus.

254
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,165
Thank Christ.
Come on, sheriff's in town. Give us two.

255
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,332
Just the stuff, huh.
That'll do nicely.

256
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,354
And how's that wife
of yours keeping then?

257
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,774
Every day is Valentine's Day.

258
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,457
- And you'd be Cupid, aye?
- I'm the very boy, Robbo.

259
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,332
- Some man, some man.
- I'm the very boy.

260
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,499
Well, I'd better be
going home then, boys.

261
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,040
Right enough.
Take care of yourself then, pal.

262
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,124
What's up with him?

263
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,374
Never got a good word
to say about anybody, that guy.

264
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,332
Who, Dougie Gillman?

265
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:27,165
Stab you in the back
without even thinking about it.

266
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,332
Catholic, you see.

267
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,195
Saying that, look at
young Ray Lennox there.

268
00:17:32,221 --> 00:17:34,815
He's as Protestant as
you and I, and yet...

269
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,665
Better no' say anything, actually.
He's... Nah.

270
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,749
- Oh, no, go on, Robbo.
- No, he's a good boy, he's a good boy.

271
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,957
Oh, go on. Go on.

272
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,332
Do you see him in here?

273
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:49,207
I don't even have to look around
and I know that the answer is no.

274
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,457
It's 3/1, he's in
that deviant wine bar

275
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,749
with the lesbian Amanda Drummond,
cooking up all sorts of shenanigans.

276
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,832
Oh, you're an awful man, Robbo.

277
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,957
What do you think the main topic of
conversation between them is gonna be?

278
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,207
You.

279
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,749
Maybe me.

280
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,457
Promotion. That's what, my friend.

281
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,540
You think young Lennox is running with
the hounds and hunting with the hares?

282
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,124
You said it, Gus.

283
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,915
I better keep a beady eye
on that wee bastard.

284
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,582
Don't want him spoiling
the old promotion chances.

285
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,915
Christ, no.

286
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,165
- Come on, come on, come on the Hearts.
- Are you a big fan then, mate?

287
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,457
- I am indeed, pal.
- So am I.

288
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,832
Let me guess, here comes the bit
about you being one as well.

289
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,424
Ever since your granddaddy
took you as a wee laddie.

290
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,774
Blah, blah, pish and shite.

291
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,915
- Job Centre's that way, Santa sweetheart.
- Merry Christmas anyway, pal.

292
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,832
I heard it's gonna be
a cold one, mind you.

293
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,457
Have a nice day.

294
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:26,207
Oh, 2-1 . You fucking beauty!
Come on.

295
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,749
- Colin! Colin, come on!
- Oh, for fuck's sake!

296
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,832
- Please help. Somebody, please.
- Out my way, out my way. I'm police.

297
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,832
Hey, what's happening?
Has anybody called an ambulance yet?

298
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,665
- Colin, look at me.
- Has he stopped breathing?

299
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,749
Do something, please. Do something.

300
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,749
Come on, Colin.

301
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,540
Colin. Colin.

302
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,124
Look at me. Come on.

303
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,165
Colin! Colin, come on!

304
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,457
Come on!

305
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:56,249
Oh, God.

306
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,957
What's happened
to that fucking ambulance then, eh?

307
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,207
- Oh, God!
- Somebody phone an ambulance!

308
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,207
How have you been since
our last consultation, Bruce?

309
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,832
No problems, I presume, eh?

310
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,749
None.

311
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,832
I trust you're still taking
your medication regularly, yes?

312
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,624
Oh, aye.

313
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,957
Well, this should see you through
to your next appointment, yes?

314
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,415
I'll see you in the new year.

315
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,457
Right?

316
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,915
- Merry Christmas to you, Bruce.
- Thank you, Dr Rossi. Thank you.

317
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:45,874
And Merry Christmas to you, too, eh?

318
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,624
Well, thank you for that, Bruce.

319
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,040
Oh, yes...

320
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,332
Fuck off!

321
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,332
Hello.

322
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:24,707
Welcome to the Fantastic Shed Show.

323
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,957
My mum's in. If she hears that I'm doing a
TV show out in the garden, she'll go mad.

324
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,249
Cunty Bunty, Cunty Bunty,
how does your big minge grow?

325
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,457
- Hello?
- Hello, Bunty.

326
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,165
It's Frank Sidebottom here.

327
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,749
I've had just about enough of you.

328
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:48,832
He told us, right, that you have got
a big hairy fanny, though, Bunty.

329
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,957
- You're pathetic!
- That you...

330
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,540
like to take it up the bum, Bunty.

331
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,415
- Who told you that nonsense?
- Eh...

332
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,249
- Are you ready, Little Frank?
- Little Frank.

333
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,058
Who's Little Frank?

334
00:21:58,084 --> 00:21:59,774
I'm not talking any
more, Bunty, I've got...

335
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,707
- Is that you, Mum?
- Oh, it's my mum.

336
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:06,624
No, I'm not talking to dirty prostitutes
again, Mum. You can't have the phone...

337
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,249
Thank you, brothers.

338
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:18,707
That concludes the formal part of this
evening's proceedings and our meeting.

339
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:22,040
Let us now retire for
a moment of harmony.

340
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:34,457
- What made you join the force, Bruce?
- Police oppression, brother.

341
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:37,457
I'd witnessed far too many cases of it
in the mining community I grew up in.

342
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,332
And you wanted to stamp it out
from the inside?

343
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:42,624
- No, I wanted to be a part of it.
- You're a terror, Bruce.

344
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:46,957
Clifford Blades, a chartered
accountant and therefore a sad wanker.

345
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:50,082
Bladesey's not only the newest and
most gullible member of this Lodge,

346
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,749
he's also the wealthiest.

347
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:55,124
Ideal target practice for the games.
Same rules apply.

348
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,457
And that's why the Craft's been so good
for me, Bruce. Everyone's accepted.

349
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:00,832
Enough of that shite.
Are you getting any at home, Bladesey?

350
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:04,124
Well, that side of
things hasn't improved.

351
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,249
This crank caller
just won't stop phoning Bunty.

352
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,124
It's affecting her, you know...

353
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,165
Thing about women,
you have to shag them regularly.

354
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:14,165
You keep them fucked, man,
they will do absolutely anything for you.

355
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,540
Actually, two things.
Well shod, well shagged.

356
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,449
And that's what you do
with your wife, Bruce?

357
00:23:18,475 --> 00:23:19,482
Course it fucking is.

358
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:23,624
See, these marriage counselling fucking
spastics, they will tell you a load of shite.

359
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:27,749
The root of any marital problem
is always, always sexual.

360
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:30,832
If you're no' fucking the woman
you're with, it opens this...

361
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,957
- Vacuum.
- ...vacuum, which sure as fuck

362
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,749
some other cunt is
gonna come and fill,

363
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:38,832
and fill with several inches of prime
Scottish beef, Brother Blades.

364
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,832
And, you see,
if she's no' doing the same for you,

365
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:44,915
you go and get it somewhere else,
just like that.

366
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:48,249
I must say, I'm looking forward
to our little trip to Hamburg.

367
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,624
- Me too, pal.
- Some nice museums.

368
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,040
Prostitutes.

369
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:53,749
Of all colours, shapes and sizes.

370
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,457
- Sláinte.
- Sláinte.

371
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:03,332
- Excuse me, Bruce. I have to spend a penny.
- Go for your life, pal. Don't fall in.

372
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:27,749
- Will it be the usual, Brother Robertson?
- Oh, yes, please, Hector.

373
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:35,083
I'll see you at my place
on the weekend then.

374
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:36,065
Okey-dokey.

375
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,457
Fucking pervert.

376
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,457
Ah, on your own tonight then,
Brother Robertson?

377
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:44,540
No, thankfully not, Brother Toal.

378
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:47,624
I just popped in to see Clifford Blades.
You've just missed him.

379
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:51,332
Well, aren't you and Brother Blades
becoming quite the bosom buddies?

380
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:54,332
- Oh, birds of a feather and all that.
- Talking of Brother Blades,

381
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:58,624
have those useless clowns from uniform found
this pervert who keeps phoning his wife?

382
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:01,207
- Regrettably not, sir, no.
- Spastics!

383
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,540
Aye.

384
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:04,290
Look, would you mind
overseeing it, Bruce?

385
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:06,749
I wouldn't normally ask
with something so trivial,

386
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:09,457
but we just can't afford
to be seen to be not taking care

387
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:14,124
of such a potentially important benefactor
to the lodge as Clifford Blades.

388
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:18,332
And what's good for the lodge
is good for the polis, eh?

389
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:22,457
And another little brownie point for
the promotion, Brother Robertson.

390
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:24,249
Hush-hush, Toal. Hush-hush.

391
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:29,540
Just you leave Mr and Mrs Blades
in my safe hands, OK, Brother Toal?

392
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:39,124
How can you just misplace £200?

393
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:43,332
If I find out there's
another woman involved, Clifford...

394
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:57,374
This is Bruce, the detective friend
I was telling you about, dear.

395
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:01,624
Well, well, Clifford!

396
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:05,540
You never told me you were hiding
such a beautiful specimen.

397
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:07,124
You are punching above
your weight, champ.

398
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:11,624
You're the one who's taking Clifford on
this Masons' weekend to Scarborough, right?

399
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:13,624
Sc...

400
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:19,457
Aye, I am taking him to Scarborough.

401
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:22,457
It's a pleasure to meet you, Bunty.

402
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,249
Please, to business.

403
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:33,124
I understand how unsettling
these prank calls must be to you,

404
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:34,665
but I would ask you to be brave.

405
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,249
I've dealt with this
kind of scum in the past

406
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,624
and I can tell you,
they're all mouth and no trousers.

407
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:44,207
However, slamming the phone down on him
is only going to encourage him, OK?

408
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:47,957
And if I know this guy like I think I
know this guy, he's gonna like that.

409
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:50,915
So I need you to indulge
him a little bit.

410
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:52,749
He'll soon come unstuck.

411
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:56,124
But your uniformed colleague
said not to encourage him.

412
00:26:56,208 --> 00:27:00,165
Oh, aye. No, we tell the younger,
less experienced officers that, aye.

413
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,957
And it usually makes
the depravate stop.

414
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:04,415
However, if you're wanting
the man caught...

415
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,915
I want him caught all right.
I want that bastard to suffer!

416
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,540
Excellent.

417
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,832
Well, in that case,
I suggest you play along.

418
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:18,957
Tell him something about yourself.
What you like.

419
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:25,165
Up the stakes.
Let hunter become hunted.

420
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:29,749
We'll nail this slimy bastard
for you, Clifford, no danger.

421
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:32,249
Bunty, we're gonna get him.
I can promise you that.

422
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:34,540
Now, I want you to look after
that brave, brave woman.

423
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:36,124
Oh, I will, Bruce, I will.

424
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,430
I can't tell you how
grateful I am, Bruce.

425
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:40,482
Oh, you just thank
your hubby here.

426
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,624
Low friends in high
places, eh, Bladesey boy?

427
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:05,249
A quick word, sir?

428
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:13,999
Bruce. How goes the case?

429
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,415
- Aye, fairly cut and dried actually, Bob.
- Aye.

430
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:23,457
A well-known, nasty little mob have been
fingered by a willing informant, so it's...

431
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:24,624
New poster.

432
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:27,415
Just a case of gathering
the necessary evidence.

433
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:29,665
- Me and Gus are on surveillance.
- Good.

434
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:34,540
The political thing has died a death now
and the papers have got bored with it.

435
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:37,749
A wog's a wog for all that,
eh, Brother Robertson?

436
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:42,915
- You said it, Brother Toal.
- Your words, not mine.

437
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,332
Right, about my cycling
trip to Germany, sir.

438
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:51,040
Oh, I can't say I'm pulling handkerchiefs
out of my arse at the prospect

439
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:53,915
but I suppose a few days
won't put us too far behind.

440
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:57,124
What does Carole have to say about you
going away so close to Christmas?

441
00:28:57,208 --> 00:29:00,124
Oh, her and Stacey are just looking
forward to their big presents.

442
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:03,124
I always bring them back something
nice, so there's never any problem.

443
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:07,124
- You're the boss at home, then, Robbo?
- Man of the fucking house and all that.

444
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,540
Quite. OK...

445
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:20,040
Just make sure you brief
Amanda Drummond before you go.

446
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:28,124
Do you really think she's got the balls
to take over the reins in my absence?

447
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:30,790
Think I'd rather hand temporary control
over to Gus Bain if you don't mind.

448
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:34,874
It's only for a short while
and she needs the experience anyway.

449
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:38,124
- Mmm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

450
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:43,253
How the fuck did she
ever get out of uniform?

451
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,774
By shagging Toal, that's how.

452
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:46,624
No!

453
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,874
See, every time a woman drops
her trousers, promotion.

454
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:51,749
Every time a man drops theirs,
disciplinary action.

455
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,165
Where's the equality in that?

456
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:58,040
Bingo!
There's the fucker we're after.

457
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:02,832
No, no, just you wait there, Gus, OK?
No point going in mob-handed.

458
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:04,040
OK.

459
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,082
Wanna buy some flowers.

460
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:25,249
Can I help you, sir?

461
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:28,290
How's business?

462
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:29,790
All right, I suppose.

463
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:31,540
Really? I just seen a man
leave empty-handed.

464
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:33,999
- No' have anything in his line, no?
- No.

465
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,249
- Who was he?
- Just some guy after roses.

466
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:38,499
- I guess he changed his mind.
- Mmm-hmm.

467
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:43,374
- Do I know you from somewhere?
- No.

468
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:47,290
No, you don't. No, you fucking don't.

469
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:49,249
- What have I done wrong?
- Wasting police time,

470
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:52,207
withholding information and possibly
harbouring a murder suspect.

471
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:54,374
- That's shite.
- You will fucking cough up

472
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:58,124
or I swear to God you will be stuffing
cuddly toys in Corton Vale Prison

473
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,957
faster than you can tie
a bunch of fucking daffodils.

474
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:02,749
Or maybe...

475
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:07,249
maybe you would rather get
your tulips around my bulbs.

476
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:10,999
Would you like that?

477
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:12,790
I think you would.

478
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:15,999
Look, he's just a guy I
know from the clubs.

479
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,707
He comes in to talk about
music and that is all.

480
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:22,374
So, are you and your wee boyfriend just a
two-man musical appreciation society then?

481
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,290
- Is that what you're fucking telling me?
- He's not my boyfriend, honest.

482
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:31,374
I hope not.

483
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:35,290
For his sake, you fat bastard.

484
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,749
- Watch where you're...
- Sorry.

485
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:43,790
Hello. Eh...

486
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:46,207
How are you?

487
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:50,207
Yeah, I'm just going to
pick the flowers up.

488
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:54,082
- Oh, what, is the funeral today, aye?
- Yeah.

489
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:57,874
Right. Was that your wreath?
The one that says "Dad"?

490
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,999
- Yeah.
- Um...

491
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,999
How many kids have you got?

492
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:08,707
Just one, a wee boy.

493
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:14,665
You ever lost anyone close?

494
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,374
Mmm-hmm.

495
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:21,374
Hurts like hell, eh?

496
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:23,999
Mmm-hmm.

497
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:29,707
Um...

498
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:33,082
Listen, I've got to go.
I'm really sorry, I've got to go.

499
00:32:52,541 --> 00:33:00,874
Davie?

500
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:06,874
Fuck!

501
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,790
Ah, Bruce, I hear you
have a pain, yes?

502
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:47,582
Oh, a pain indeed, Doctor.

503
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:51,165
And would this pain be
one of your physical pains, yes?

504
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,207
No, Doctor, my other kind.

505
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:57,249
Well, the final destination
of the pain recovery train

506
00:33:57,375 --> 00:34:00,165
is self-help via
abstinence, Bruce, eh?

507
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:03,957
I've already booked my seat in advance.
Super-saver all the same.

508
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:07,290
No more cocaine and chip suppers
for Bruce, eh?

509
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:10,124
Oh, those items were previously
favourites of the Detective Sergeant,

510
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:11,415
of course they were.

511
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,790
And what of this promotion, eh?

512
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:17,207
A mere formality, I'm sure.

513
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:20,999
Only champions can
rewrite history, yes?

514
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:23,915
Yes, I've always believed that
it's the winning that's important,

515
00:34:23,941 --> 00:34:24,815
not the taking part.

516
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:29,374
Only winners are more attractive
to the opposite sex, Bruce, eh?

517
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:34,082
Like our successful friend
here, the tapeworm.

518
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:36,707
Yes?

519
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,207
Who do we trust, Bruce?

520
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:40,582
Why, no one, of course.

521
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:45,957
Not your friends, not your family,
not even yourself, Bruce.

522
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:49,790
Especially not yourself, eh?

523
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:52,290
Now, about that pain...

524
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:54,957
Yes!

525
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,874
Come on, big man, you stiffen up.

526
00:34:56,958 --> 00:35:00,790
Come on, big man, you fucking stiffen.
Come on, big man, you fucking stiffen...

527
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,874
Fucking, fucking!

528
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:07,790
Ugly little fucking slag.

529
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:16,999
Dirty poofy bastard.

530
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:36,874
Peter. Peter, have you seen the
graffiti in the men's toilets?

531
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,207
What? No.

532
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:41,999
Some nasty little bastard
has written something which,

533
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:44,582
well, let's just say,
questions your sexuality.

534
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:51,749
Well, there's always something or other.
I don't let it bother me any more, Bruce.

535
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:53,874
It's silly.

536
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,499
Oh, come on, man. You elected
me your union representative

537
00:35:56,666 --> 00:35:58,249
so I have to let it bother me

538
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:01,749
and I can't have your character defamed
in this outrageous manner any longer.

539
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:02,832
I'm going straight to Toal.

540
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,665
No, no, you're all right, Bruce.
I'll just go and clean it off.

541
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:09,165
Somebody is playing
silly billies here.

542
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:11,499
- Such a load of bloody nonsense.
- And I just hope...

543
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,707
I just hope

544
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:16,790
I don't find out who.

545
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:20,207
Gaffer? Gaffer, I want you to come and see
some more of this disgusting graffiti

546
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:22,290
that's been written about
poor Peter Inglis.

547
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:23,499
I don't have time for every...

548
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:27,290
As fed rep I don't have time
to see a fellow officer humiliated.

549
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:30,374
Of course. Listen, Robbo...

550
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,582
- Peter isn't...
- What, sir?

551
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:35,999
You're gonna have to be careful
what you say here, sir.

552
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:39,665
He isn't like the graffiti says...

553
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,165
Is he?

554
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:45,207
Whether he is or isn't
is entirely his own business,

555
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:48,707
but he's being harassed and we
operate a non-discriminatory policy

556
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:50,290
on the grounds of
sexual orientation.

557
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,374
But he can't be sexually harassed
if he's not really, well...

558
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:56,499
What, sir?

559
00:36:56,666 --> 00:37:00,790
Gay, I think the fashionable term
for it is these days.

560
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:03,249
What he gets up to privately
is his own business.

561
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:07,790
To be honest with you, I don't even know
that much about the chap, but... Oh.

562
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:11,082
This bullying...
This bullying has to stop.

563
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:18,499
Did you do her up the arse?

564
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:22,082
Where else is there?
Pussy's for faggots.

565
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,957
Right, come on, let's go and see what
Gorman and his wee boyfriend are made of.

566
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:37,207
Everything you need to know about
those guys are in the jars, darling.

567
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:44,540
- DN-fucking-A, man. Really?
- Jesus Christ.

568
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,249
Maisie, gratitude.

569
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:57,290
See, this is the wonderful thing
about being polis, Ray.

570
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,332
Doesn't really matter
if everybody hates your guts

571
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:02,207
as long as they're civil
to your fucking face.

572
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:03,499
Is that no' right, Maisie?

573
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:06,999
Same rules apply, darling.
Same rules apply.

574
00:38:07,791 --> 00:38:12,290
See, Maisie here would teach you
things your mother wouldn't.

575
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,290
I only do it for love now, son.

576
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,915
If you change your mind,
this is the boy for the job.

577
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,707
Getting quite the reputation as a
young stallion, aren't you, pal, eh?

578
00:38:19,791 --> 00:38:23,749
Right, we'd better be off-ski.
We've got the Christmas party.

579
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:26,165
Christ, I never thought I'd see the
day when I left a knocking shop

580
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:28,790
with more spunk than I came in with.

581
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:32,790
- Thank you.
- Thanks very much, son.

582
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:36,707
I tell you, Gus,
this is the only kind of networking

583
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:38,915
I don't mind doing with
the Indian community.

584
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,457
I do love a good
curry all the same.

585
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:43,587
Edith and I, we're
actually thinking of going

586
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:45,399
to Sri Lanka next year
for our holidays.

587
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,665
- I don't know. Show us your tits.
- Show me yours, I'll show you mine.

588
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,082
Party games. Gather round.

589
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,095
I remember when I used
to work in Sydney,

590
00:38:59,121 --> 00:39:02,024
we played this party game
at the crimbo party.

591
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:03,207
What was that, then?

592
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:06,665
Oh, no. Listen, there's ladies
present, Karen, so I better not say.

593
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:09,457
Come on, Robbo, don't start something
you cannot fucking finish, man.

594
00:39:10,958 --> 00:39:13,207
- Come on, Brucie. Come on, Brucie.
- All right.

595
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:16,749
- Well, come on, pal. Let's go, man.
- OK, then, Raymondo.

596
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:20,499
What we would do is, all the men
would go to the photocopying room.

597
00:39:20,666 --> 00:39:23,290
One by one, of course.
No offence if that's your thing.

598
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:27,499
And what we'd do is we would photocopy
an image of our wedding tackle.

599
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:31,957
Oh, I just knew
what was going on here!

600
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,999
And then one of the sheilas
would pin it to a notice board.

601
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:41,082
It'd then be up to the lassies to match the
male member with the corresponding owner.

602
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:43,249
- What a load of bollocks, man.
- Let's do it.

603
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:45,082
Come on!

604
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:48,957
Fuck me with that horse's cock.

605
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,790
What?

606
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:25,790
Here we go, lads, another round.

607
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:29,374
Who the fuck is that?

608
00:41:31,666 --> 00:41:33,707
Peter. Peter!

609
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:38,082
I haven't seen you in such a long time,
sweetie. Where have you been hiding?

610
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,499
Brought some friends along, I see.

611
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:43,832
Who the fuck are you?
Here, I don't know this guy.

612
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:48,374
Sorry, I didn't realise
it was that kind of scene.

613
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:51,082
Huh! Peter can be so sensitive.

614
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:54,540
Ho! I don't fucking know you! OK?

615
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:56,874
- Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man.
- But I don't know the guy, Ray.

616
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:58,707
Well, he seems to know you.

617
00:41:58,791 --> 00:42:01,790
You wrote that fucking shite
on the toilet wall, didn't you?

618
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:05,499
Did I fuck! Probably one of
your fucking boyfriends.

619
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:12,999
You disgust me.
Get your face off my cock!

620
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:17,499
Get off me, you fucking cocksucker!

621
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:19,665
Don't even think about
defending Gillman.

622
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,999
Well, I'm gonna have to consider
my position on that one, Bob.

623
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:25,374
Bruce, things are bloody difficult for me at
the moment with this murder case nuisance.

624
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:28,999
On top of that, not only is there
a latent Nazi racist homophobe

625
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:31,582
but a bloody jessie boy in the hat
for the inspector's post.

626
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:34,749
Now, listen, are you referring to
Brother Inglis here? Cos if you are...

627
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:38,082
How can we have someone of his
disposition leading fellow officers?

628
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:39,874
Policy or no bloody policy,

629
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,499
I won't pretend I don't find the idea
of two men doing it to each other...

630
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:48,207
totally disgusting.

631
00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:50,874
But that's by the way.

632
00:42:50,958 --> 00:42:52,963
I still don't see what
that's got to do...

633
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:54,107
Oh, come on, Bruce.

634
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:57,707
How can you have confidence in a man who is
constantly undressing you with his eyes,

635
00:42:57,791 --> 00:43:00,124
masturbating over images of you?

636
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:01,707
It'd just be a compromise.

637
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:04,290
Surely that's a bit caveman, Bob.

638
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:07,290
In some parts of the country the force
even advertise in the gay press now.

639
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:09,957
This isn't some parts
of the country.

640
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:13,290
This is Scotland, by Christ!

641
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:34,915
Me and Bruce play these
break-up/make-up games,

642
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,832
but it only makes our
hearts grow fonder.

643
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:42,707
In a sense we're always together,
because nothing...

644
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:48,165
Space, time, or distance,
can break our delicious communion.

645
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:57,624
- Here are your drinks, sir.
- Merci, Fräulein, merci.

646
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,207
But heterosexual anal sex
need not imply an attitude of misogyny.

647
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:07,749
I read in one of Bunty's magazines that 20%
of heterosexual couples enjoy anal sex

648
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:10,999
- while only 50% of homosexual couples do.
- Whoa, ho, ho.

649
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:13,999
What, are you saying that half the
fucking poofs walking about down there

650
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:16,124
don't actually do each other
up the fucking arsehole?

651
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:18,082
Bruce, I was only telling you
what the article said.

652
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:21,499
Aye, and I'll tell you something else
about all that fucking rap music, man.

653
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:24,874
It's all fucking bullshit cos I
read this article, proper, medical.

654
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,790
It says that white women, right,
are 1 0 times more likely

655
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:29,582
to give blowjobs than black women.

656
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:30,874
So where does that leave them?

657
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:34,124
Up the fucking spout without a
blowjob, that's where, pal.

658
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:36,415
Well, unless it's the white women
who they're referring to

659
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,582
who are actually
performing the fellatio.

660
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:41,207
Let me tell you something, Bladesey.

661
00:44:41,291 --> 00:44:44,915
Only a white bird who was not
right in the fucking head

662
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,040
would even think about
going with one of them.

663
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:58,207
It wasn't even a
country until 1 865.

664
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:06,790
Fish market, the actor Hans Albers
and FC St Pauli football club.

665
00:45:06,958 --> 00:45:10,082
Get into the fucking index
and look up fucking "fanny".

666
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:13,082
The Reeperbahn, the
red light district.

667
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,790
Need to take a picture
of what a cunt looks like.

668
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:39,082
Can you put that in a bottle?

669
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:40,540
No. Don't touch it, Bruce.
You're not allowed to.

670
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:42,246
You've got to be able to
touch fucking history.

671
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:43,149
No, you can't, Bruce.

672
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:45,082
Bruce!

673
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:48,082
Bruce! Bruce!

674
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,499
Bruce!

675
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:08,957
Is this a real prostitute?

676
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:12,499
Arschficken, me and her. 50?

677
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:15,207
- Arschficken. 50.
- Thanks very much.

678
00:46:15,291 --> 00:46:16,374
Right, Brunhilde.

679
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:20,207
- My name's Clifford.
- Bladesey, don't go bareback.

680
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:21,790
I'm a Gemini.

681
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,749
Can I just have a glass of water?

682
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:28,165
Not at all. I've got something else
in mind for you.

683
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:32,749
Here, here, here, here, here.
Look at these two. Look at these two.

684
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34,957
Fucking bufties. Disgusting.

685
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,249
Absolutely fucking...

686
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:39,707
disgusting.

687
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:44,915
I've never seen the
attraction of it myself.

688
00:46:45,291 --> 00:46:46,790
Cheers, pal.

689
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:48,165
Cheers.

690
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:14,332
Bladesey, just take your coat off.
You're overheating, man. Just fucking...

691
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:19,540
Bladesey, I...

692
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:23,415
I need you to fucking calm yourself.
You're really messing with my fucking trip.

693
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:24,707
Calm your...

694
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:28,624
Fucking calm yourself, man.
Calm yourself. Fuck off...

695
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:31,915
You're on your fucking own, Bladesey.

696
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:10,332
Fuck off!

697
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,332
Get your fucking hands off me!

698
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:15,415
Piss off!

699
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:33,207
Carole.

700
00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:36,124
Carole.

701
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:39,124
No. Where's Stacey?
Where's Stacey? Where's Stacey?

702
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:13,624
Hello?

703
00:49:13,791 --> 00:49:16,832
Do you know what time it is, Bruce?
Get into work right now.

704
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,665
Right... Right, I'll be
in in, say, 25 minutes.

705
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:47,832
You wanted to...

706
00:49:49,291 --> 00:49:50,540
see me?

707
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,540
Take a seat.

708
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:53,915
As you obviously know, Bruce,

709
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,207
Amanda took a lead role in the murder
investigation in your absence.

710
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:02,957
I have decided after some deliberation
that this should remain the case.

711
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,124
You have got to be fucking joking me!

712
00:50:05,208 --> 00:50:06,832
- I beg your pardon?
- Are you deaf?

713
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:09,624
I expect you to give her
your full co-operation.

714
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:13,582
Since you've been away the media
have taken an interest again.

715
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:17,874
Press relations is exactly the kind of
area that Amanda here is strong in.

716
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:23,124
Amanda, can you please brief Bruce
on the latest developments?

717
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:24,290
Yes, Bob.

718
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:26,915
Gus has already filled me in,
so there's really no need.

719
00:50:27,041 --> 00:50:28,415
Gus isn't on the ball, Bruce!

720
00:50:28,541 --> 00:50:31,040
OK, then, Mandy, fire away.

721
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:33,124
We're going to have to bring in
Gorman for questioning.

722
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:35,957
Not so sure that's a
good idea there, Mandy.

723
00:50:36,041 --> 00:50:40,249
You see, he's a hardened criminal and with
a lawyer like Conrad Donaldson behind him

724
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:42,124
could go either way.

725
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:45,124
Nice cycling trip, Bruce?

726
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,415
Enough with the idle banter.
Shall we crack on with the case?

727
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:52,249
Maybe start by finding this blonde
witness you forgot to tell us about.

728
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:56,332
These are crafty bastards we're
dealing with. We need hard evidence.

729
00:50:57,416 --> 00:50:58,915
I'll just go and get some, eh?

730
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:04,624
- Bruce, can I have a word?
- Course you can, sweetheart.

731
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:07,832
Do you have to refer to me
in that condescending way?

732
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:10,094
Mandy, you're taking
this far too seriously.

733
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,232
My name is Amanda.

734
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:14,624
You think you've got a chance of getting
this fucking promotion, don't you?

735
00:51:16,416 --> 00:51:17,415
Bruce.

736
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,124
- Someone here to see you.
- Maybe in a wee min...

737
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:27,040
We'll continue this later.

738
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,040
Maybe a wee bit of
privacy, eh, Peter?

739
00:51:39,416 --> 00:51:43,290
I came last week,
but they told me you were on holiday.

740
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:48,124
I wanted to thank you personally
for everything you did for Colin.

741
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:50,999
Aye. Aye, well, I just wish
I could have done more to help him.

742
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:57,624
This is the man who tried
to save your daddy.

743
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,249
He helped when the others
just stood back and watched.

744
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:03,915
He's a fine man, son.

745
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:08,540
I'd like you to be like
him when you grow up.

746
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:17,124
They said it was
your favourite team's colours so...

747
00:52:18,416 --> 00:52:20,124
I knitted it especially.

748
00:52:21,541 --> 00:52:23,999
I just wanted to say...

749
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:27,665
Merry Christmas.

750
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,624
Say bye to the detective, Euan.

751
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,624
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye, pal.

752
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:41,707
Here, here, here... Don't...
Don't go. Um... Just...

753
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:44,207
This is...

754
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:46,749
This is just my...

755
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:49,415
It's my home telephone number.

756
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,124
And my home address.

757
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:55,457
In case you ever need any help.

758
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,707
For anything.

759
00:53:01,416 --> 00:53:02,999
Thanks.

760
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,415
Do you know what
Drummond says to me?

761
00:53:15,541 --> 00:53:19,499
She tells me that we've got
to bring in Gorman for questioning.

762
00:53:21,541 --> 00:53:24,915
I just laughed in her face
and then I fucked off.

763
00:53:25,041 --> 00:53:26,915
- What do you think of that?
- Aye, nice job, mate.

764
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,040
- Aye.
- Yeah.

765
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:31,749
These young ones, Ray.
These fucking young ones!

766
00:53:34,666 --> 00:53:36,207
I'll get the drinks in.

767
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:52,957
Listen, Robbo, I've got
something to tell you.

768
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:56,999
I don't want you getting the wrong idea and
this is why I'm letting you know first.

769
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:02,415
Listen, I really want to get on
in the department, right,

770
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,915
but I've not got
enough experience, though, eh?

771
00:54:07,541 --> 00:54:09,207
I don't know, Ray.

772
00:54:10,291 --> 00:54:11,999
All depends on how good
you are, doesn't it?

773
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,207
I mean, I even thought about
applying for the inspector's job.

774
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:20,624
You know, but I just thought it was a good
idea to get some practice with the...

775
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:24,457
you know, with the
selection procedures.

776
00:54:26,708 --> 00:54:29,874
- What do you think?
- Cannot do you any harm, pal.

777
00:54:31,041 --> 00:54:33,749
You're right. It can't do any harm,
you know, flying up a kite,

778
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:35,915
just so they know
who Ray fucking Lennox is, eh?

779
00:54:42,416 --> 00:54:44,915
You need to watch some sly bastards.

780
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:47,790
- What do you mean?
- I'm just saying

781
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:51,290
that you need to watch
some sly bastards.

782
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:53,624
Like who? Who?

783
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:55,415
Gus.

784
00:54:56,291 --> 00:54:57,707
- Gus Bain?
- Aye.

785
00:54:59,125 --> 00:55:01,124
I mean, he's always been all right
with me, man, you know.

786
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:04,374
He's been taking quite an interest
in the extracurricular activities

787
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:06,832
of a certain Ray Lennox.

788
00:55:06,916 --> 00:55:10,040
Just watch what you say
about Bonnie Prince Charlie here

789
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:12,415
when Gus Bain is around.
Do you understand me?

790
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:15,832
You know, I would never say anything
about the chang to anybody, you know?

791
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:19,725
But I will definitely
watch what I fucking say

792
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:22,399
around that sly old
fucking grasser now, eh?

793
00:55:22,625 --> 00:55:24,624
You cannot fucking trust
anybody any more, can you?

794
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:39,749
I must look divine, especially in
the middle of this bunch of freaks.

795
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:47,124
They all fancy Carole Robertson, see?

796
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:51,415
Well, you can look,
but you can't touch.

797
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:58,415
There's only one person
that can have me.

798
00:55:58,541 --> 00:56:03,707
Although, if he really wants me,
he'll have to get that promotion.

799
00:56:04,625 --> 00:56:06,457
Time waits for no man.

800
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:16,249
Yeah?
What have you got, darling?

801
00:56:19,916 --> 00:56:23,499
What do you think? Is it nice?
Oh, it's quite nice.

802
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,415
That's it.

803
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,332
Hello, darling.
Wave to the camera, darling.

804
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:50,624
I'm not too sure about
this one, Bruce.

805
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,540
- Hello?
- I bet...

806
00:56:58,125 --> 00:57:01,915
You've been thinking about me a lot,
haven't you, Bunty?

807
00:57:03,541 --> 00:57:06,249
I haven't stopped thinking about you.

808
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:11,415
I bet they told you
to ignore me, though.

809
00:57:11,541 --> 00:57:14,832
- Didn't they?
- Oh yes, they fucking did.

810
00:57:15,541 --> 00:57:17,124
But...

811
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:20,165
This is...

812
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:24,082
so much more fun, Frank.

813
00:57:24,916 --> 00:57:26,790
Would you...

814
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:30,707
What?

815
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:35,582
Would you

816
00:57:35,666 --> 00:57:38,665
like to see my cock,

817
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:41,332
Bunty?

818
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,624
I'd like to do more than that, Frank.

819
00:57:46,041 --> 00:57:48,999
I'd like to

820
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:52,332
put your cock in my fucking mouth.

821
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:56,624
That's what I would like to do.

822
00:57:58,333 --> 00:58:01,832
And then I would like you

823
00:58:01,916 --> 00:58:04,165
to put your cock

824
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:07,999
inside of my fucking beautiful body.

825
00:58:10,541 --> 00:58:14,915
That's what I would like, Frank,
and for you to go as fast as you can.

826
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:17,874
Fucking go as fast

827
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:19,999
as you can, Frank!

828
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,624
Fuck me. Fuck me!

829
00:58:28,791 --> 00:58:31,415
- Yeah!
- That's what I'd like, Frank.

830
00:58:38,125 --> 00:58:42,249
How's the lovely
Carole at Christmas?

831
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:45,124
A lovely Christmas carol.

832
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:46,832
Yes?

833
00:59:09,541 --> 00:59:11,165
Eh? Eh?

834
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:13,165
Eh?

835
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,749
Bigger pain, bigger jar.

836
00:59:15,833 --> 00:59:18,915
Bigger pills, Bruce, yes?

837
00:59:19,041 --> 00:59:20,207
Yeah!

838
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:24,124
Fuck you, Carole Robertson!
Fuck you, Carole Robertson!

839
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:27,999
Turn off my gas, Bruce!

840
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:34,624
Fuck you, Dougie Gillman!

841
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:42,915
Repressed people.

842
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:46,040
You have to pity them
more than anything else.

843
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:49,582
I was like that before I met Bruce.

844
00:59:50,791 --> 00:59:53,165
But he brought me out of myself.

845
00:59:56,041 --> 00:59:59,124
That's what our sex club was about.

846
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:02,832
Bruce knows that
our wee games and flirtations

847
01:00:02,916 --> 01:00:07,624
only serve to strengthen our love by
making it confront its true nature.

848
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:11,915
I'm a better person now.

849
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:14,832
A different person.

850
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:51,540
The fucking bitch has left me.

851
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:56,457
Christmas fucking Day
and the bitch leaves me.

852
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:08,624
- Merry Christmas, Robbo!
- Aye, same to you, Gus. Same to you.

853
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:10,332
So what's your plans, then?

854
01:02:10,416 --> 01:02:13,499
Ah, just the usual family
shite and all that.

855
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:15,207
Me, too.

856
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:17,415
Fuck!

857
01:02:20,208 --> 01:02:22,790
Are you all right, Bruce?

858
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:25,124
Oh, aye.

859
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,915
- Are you all right, Robbo?
- Aye.

860
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:32,915
- Happy Christmas, sir.
- Don't you "Happy Christmas" me.

861
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:34,915
- Come again?
- Look at the state you're in, Bruce.

862
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:38,249
You're a disgrace to the force.
This murder case is still hanging over us

863
01:02:38,333 --> 01:02:40,832
and you haven't even managed to find
the Blades' phantom phone-caller.

864
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,499
I am quickly becoming
the laughing-stock of the Lodge.

865
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:46,790
And you are about to lose any chance
you ever had of this promotion.

866
01:02:46,916 --> 01:02:49,124
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I know who the pervert is, sir.

867
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:50,415
Aye...

868
01:02:51,666 --> 01:02:52,999
It's Clifford Blades.

869
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,332
It's Clifford Blades himself, sir.

870
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:01,832
I'll get you proof.

871
01:03:02,541 --> 01:03:05,040
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

872
01:03:19,541 --> 01:03:20,999
Davie.

873
01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:28,624
Davie, it wasn't my fault.

874
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:33,707
It wasn't my...

875
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:47,249
Your message sounded urgent,
so I came straight over.

876
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:49,874
I wanted to drop your
present off anyway

877
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:52,124
because I'm going to England
to see my parents.

878
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:54,165
Mother's not very well.

879
01:03:55,125 --> 01:03:57,749
Bunty's not best pleased
about me going.

880
01:03:57,833 --> 01:03:59,415
This creep just won't
stop phoning her.

881
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:03,707
I... I never got you anything.

882
01:04:03,791 --> 01:04:05,624
Doesn't matter.

883
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:10,332
It's good to see you, pal.

884
01:04:10,916 --> 01:04:12,124
Good to see somebody.

885
01:04:13,208 --> 01:04:15,040
Good to see you.

886
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:18,832
You want a wee whisky? Cheer you up.

887
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,707
- No, best not. I'm driving.
- You'll fucking sit down, man!

888
01:04:22,583 --> 01:04:25,415
You'll stay over here tonight
and you'll go tomorrow, OK?

889
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,749
OK.

890
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:30,624
- Won't your wife mind?
- She's at her mum's. Her mum's in Aviemore.

891
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:35,277
Old bird's on her last
legs with heart disease.

892
01:04:35,303 --> 01:04:36,607
I'm sorry to hear that.

893
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:41,540
No, don't fucking worry about it.
Stupid slag brought it on herself.

894
01:04:42,083 --> 01:04:46,832
See, the amount of chocolate, booze and
fags she consumes, it is fucking criminal.

895
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:49,790
- What about your daughter?
- Christ, that's enough of the family pish!

896
01:05:03,625 --> 01:05:05,040
Now...

897
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:09,374
I've got a cheeky wee
single malt here for you.

898
01:05:10,916 --> 01:05:13,749
Only for the developed
palate, 49 years aged.

899
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:17,124
Ho-ho-ho, Merry Christmas
and all that shite.

900
01:05:24,416 --> 01:05:26,332
Well, I suppose one between friends
couldn't hurt.

901
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:27,624
Aye.

902
01:05:27,708 --> 01:05:29,707
- Happy Christmas.
- Is it?

903
01:05:30,916 --> 01:05:32,749
How are you getting on
with that whisky then, Bladesey?

904
01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:34,749
Feel a bit tipsy, Bruce.

905
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:43,707
Hello
and welcome to the Fantastic...

906
01:05:43,833 --> 01:05:46,415
Manchester! Manchester!

907
01:05:48,416 --> 01:05:49,957
- You do it, man.
- No.

908
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:51,249
- Come on, give it a try.
- No, really, Bruce.

909
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:52,707
- Come on, it's Christmas.
- It's not in my nature.

910
01:05:52,791 --> 01:05:54,624
Come on, don't be such
a fucking spoilsport.

911
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:59,249
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Frank Sidebottom.

912
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:00,499
I'm Frank Sidebottom.

913
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,790
My name is Frank Sidebottom.

914
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:26,374
This is a lovely surprise.

915
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:30,415
I was just checking up on my best
mate's missus while he was away,

916
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,499
seeing she was safe and secure
and all that, you know?

917
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:36,165
I don't know why you bother with him.
He's weak.

918
01:06:36,583 --> 01:06:37,790
Not like you.

919
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:39,499
No, no, no, he's...
He's one of the best, I say.

920
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:41,999
That's what I say. He's one of the best.

921
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:44,790
Oh, I wish I had a friend
who was as loyal as you.

922
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,457
You must see some terrible things
in your line of work.

923
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:53,665
Aye, I do. I really do, you know?

924
01:06:53,875 --> 01:06:55,290
But you just...
You just deal with it.

925
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:58,124
Like you do, Bunty,
with this prank phone-caller.

926
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:01,374
You don't seem to let
it get to you, do you?

927
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:07,707
Well, that's what I try to make him
think. But, you know, it hurts terribly.

928
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:09,415
Uh-huh.

929
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,540
I just wish Clifford could
be as strong as you.

930
01:07:16,416 --> 01:07:17,790
Fuck.

931
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:24,207
Fuck! Wait a minute.

932
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:27,915
This is wrong. Cliff's all right.
This is... This is really wrong.

933
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:30,374
No, no, no!

934
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:33,832
No, it's... It's... It's OK.
This is so right.

935
01:07:48,166 --> 01:07:49,165
No, no!

936
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:50,457
- What's wrong?
- It's just the...

937
01:07:50,541 --> 01:07:51,874
- Just what?
- It's just...

938
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,749
I think Cliff might be
your phantom phone-caller.

939
01:07:55,958 --> 01:07:58,374
Oh, don't be ridiculous. Come on.

940
01:08:00,916 --> 01:08:03,999
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Frank Sidebottom.

941
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:06,624
It's Frank Sidebottom.

942
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:10,207
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Frank Sidebottom.

943
01:08:10,291 --> 01:08:11,874
It's Frank Sidebottom.

944
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:13,957
Oh, my God!

945
01:08:14,208 --> 01:08:16,165
Ah, Bruce eh?

946
01:08:16,291 --> 01:08:17,332
Fuck.

947
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:21,790
Or would you like me to call you by
your little brother's name, Davie, yes?

948
01:08:21,958 --> 01:08:24,582
- What?
- Baby brothers, Bruce.

949
01:08:24,666 --> 01:08:26,624
Such a nuisance.

950
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:29,499
But you were supposed to look out
for little brother Davie, yes?

951
01:08:29,666 --> 01:08:31,082
No, no, I wasn't.

952
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:33,957
It was your idea to steal
the coal, though, yes?

953
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:35,915
No, that was Davie's idea.

954
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,582
The added incentive
of trying to please your father.

955
01:08:38,666 --> 01:08:40,832
"Let's climb the coal
mountain," you said.

956
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,374
That's it. Just little boys
playing games, Doctor.

957
01:08:43,458 --> 01:08:47,790
The games, Bruce. The games.
The same rules apply, though.

958
01:08:47,875 --> 01:08:51,624
"I'm the king of the castle!
Get down you, dirty rascal!"

959
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:53,082
Then you pushed him off.

960
01:08:53,208 --> 01:08:54,415
No, I never. No, I fucking never!

961
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,582
- Not an angry push...
- No, I didn't.

962
01:08:56,708 --> 01:09:01,207
Just a brotherly shove.
Brotherly love, a brotherly shove.

963
01:09:02,416 --> 01:09:07,499
Because wee Davie was better at everything
than his big brother, "the other laddie".

964
01:09:07,583 --> 01:09:09,415
That's what they used
to say in the village.

965
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:12,082
"Davie Robertson and
the other laddie."

966
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:14,082
You're still just "the
other laddie", aren't you?

967
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:15,457
You fuck off!

968
01:09:15,583 --> 01:09:19,624
"Fuck off", you shout,
as you push him down the slag pile.

969
01:09:19,708 --> 01:09:22,499
He's at the bottom,
screaming for help

970
01:09:22,583 --> 01:09:27,082
as the black stuff rushes down,
smothering your brother underneath.

971
01:09:27,208 --> 01:09:28,665
No, I tried to save him.

972
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:33,499
Then the man you call father, crouching
beside the body of his real son,

973
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:39,582
"This thing killed him. This bastard
spawn of the devil killed my laddie.

974
01:09:40,041 --> 01:09:42,499
"You are filth!"

975
01:09:42,583 --> 01:09:45,082
No! No!

976
01:09:45,208 --> 01:09:46,790
No, no...

977
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:50,582
What are you doing
in the women's toilets, Bruce?

978
01:09:51,166 --> 01:09:52,915
Fuck off, Drummond.

979
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,582
- You can say it's none of my business.
- It's none of your fucking business!

980
01:09:55,666 --> 01:09:56,915
What were you doing
in the women's toilets, Bruce?

981
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:57,999
Look, I'm sorry.

982
01:09:58,083 --> 01:10:01,332
I'm just feeling a bit wrong
at the moment. OK?

983
01:10:01,416 --> 01:10:03,290
OK, well, if you want to talk
about it, then I'm here.

984
01:10:03,375 --> 01:10:07,332
Spare me your airy-fairy,
namby-pamby, care-in-the-community,

985
01:10:07,416 --> 01:10:09,415
human-resources, left-wing bullshit.

986
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:12,290
Well, I'm just worried
about you, Bruce.

987
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:15,915
- What did you say?
- I said, I'm worried about you, Bruce.

988
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,999
Oh, right, I see.
You're worried about me.

989
01:10:18,166 --> 01:10:20,707
What? Oh, don't flatter yourself.

990
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:23,461
I think you're a silly,
silly, little, little man.

991
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,399
You fancy me.

992
01:10:24,458 --> 01:10:27,999
I have no interest in you, apart
from us having to work together.

993
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:30,915
- Just give in to your instincts, darling.
- Oh, God, you're pathetic.

994
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,999
- You're pathetic. You're an alcoholic.
- Fuck off.

995
01:10:33,083 --> 01:10:35,665
You stink.
Do you know what, Bruce?

996
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:39,999
You're the kind of sad case
that preys on weak, stupid women

997
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:42,582
in order to boost your
own shattered ego!

998
01:10:42,666 --> 01:10:44,499
What about Karen the other night
at the Christmas party?

999
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:46,707
She was wasted, Bruce.

1000
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:49,207
Well, she shouldn't have
fucking drunk then, should she?

1001
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:50,915
She wanted a drink, so she had one.

1002
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,915
She wanted a ride,
so she had one of them as well.

1003
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,290
So, don't treat me
like a fucking rapist!

1004
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:58,124
Jesus Christ, what are you so
interested in her for anyway?

1005
01:10:58,208 --> 01:11:01,540
- Are you a lesbian?
- I'm not a bloody lesbian, Bruce.

1006
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:04,707
I have a boyfriend
and he's far younger than you

1007
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:06,707
and he's far more
intelligent than you

1008
01:11:06,791 --> 01:11:10,624
and he's far better endowed than you,
Mr Photocopier Enlargement.

1009
01:11:10,708 --> 01:11:12,124
What did you fucking say?

1010
01:11:12,208 --> 01:11:15,874
Go on, fucking hit me, Bruce!
Are you gonna hit me, Bruce? Yeah?

1011
01:11:20,666 --> 01:11:21,707
No.

1012
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,582
Oh, my darling, I'm sorry.

1013
01:11:28,708 --> 01:11:30,957
You sicken me.

1014
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:35,082
You repulse me.
Can I make that any fucking plainer?

1015
01:11:42,291 --> 01:11:44,749
I wasn't gonna hurt you, you know?

1016
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:48,415
I didn't mean it.

1017
01:12:01,416 --> 01:12:03,207
As your colleague...

1018
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:08,582
and as a human being, I'm telling you,
Bruce, you've got some stuff to sort out.

1019
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:14,082
OK? Then you might become
the sort of person

1020
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:16,540
that you seem to imagine
yourself to be,

1021
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:18,665
although Christ only
knows what that is.

1022
01:12:19,583 --> 01:12:22,207
I used to be good at
this job, Amanda.

1023
01:12:25,916 --> 01:12:27,499
I used to be a good person.

1024
01:12:28,416 --> 01:12:30,332
Yeah. I heard that.

1025
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:36,707
- Have you got a wife, Bruce?
- Yeah.

1026
01:12:39,291 --> 01:12:40,874
Have you got any kids?

1027
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,582
Stacey.

1028
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:49,165
I think they've left me.

1029
01:12:52,583 --> 01:12:54,915
I think my family have left me.

1030
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:02,249
I don't know how.

1031
01:13:04,791 --> 01:13:06,874
I can't remember why.

1032
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:09,665
OK.

1033
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,832
You see, there's
something wrong with me.

1034
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:20,082
There's something
seriously wrong with me.

1035
01:13:21,708 --> 01:13:26,082
Have you spoken to anyone?
Have you been to see a doctor?

1036
01:13:26,208 --> 01:13:27,999
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1037
01:13:28,791 --> 01:13:29,790
No.

1038
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,124
I don't know. I don't know.

1039
01:13:37,583 --> 01:13:39,749
No, I'm in charge.

1040
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:45,249
I'm in charge of me.

1041
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:48,290
I'm in charge of this investigation and
don't you ever fucking forget that.

1042
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:51,707
OK, Bruce. You need to listen to me.
Can you hear me?

1043
01:13:52,791 --> 01:13:56,582
I'm really worried about you. I don't
think you're fit for work at the moment.

1044
01:13:56,708 --> 01:14:00,499
Just you go up there
and suck someone's cock

1045
01:14:00,666 --> 01:14:06,165
and stop playing the amateur fucking
psychologist, you evil witch!

1046
01:14:12,625 --> 01:14:13,707
Hey, Robbo.

1047
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:15,957
Are you holding a guy
by the name of Clifford Blades?

1048
01:14:16,083 --> 01:14:18,499
Do you ever get the impression
he was a pervert?

1049
01:14:18,833 --> 01:14:21,749
Just give me the fucking keys!

1050
01:14:24,958 --> 01:14:28,207
- You piss-taking little fart!
- What's wrong, Bruce?

1051
01:14:28,875 --> 01:14:31,499
You strung me along from the
fucking start! Didn't you?

1052
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:33,707
It wasn't me.
You have to believe it wasn't me.

1053
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:36,249
Don't make me punch your face
through your shoulders

1054
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:39,124
and out through your fucking arse,
you speccy wee fanny!

1055
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:41,707
Why? Why did you drag
me into this, Cliff?

1056
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:45,290
Why did you drag me into this with you?
You're supposed to be my mate.

1057
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:47,374
I didn't. We are mates, Bruce.

1058
01:14:47,458 --> 01:14:50,082
You're my best friend, Bruce.
You're my best friend.

1059
01:14:56,708 --> 01:14:58,790
Why do you bully me, Bruce?

1060
01:15:00,208 --> 01:15:02,707
- What?
- Why do you do it?

1061
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:05,582
Because...

1062
01:15:07,916 --> 01:15:10,999
Because I can't fucking help myself.

1063
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:15,999
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!

1064
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:17,832
Bruce! Bruce!

1065
01:15:17,916 --> 01:15:22,165
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!

1066
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:30,415
Fuck!

1067
01:15:31,166 --> 01:15:34,332
I tried to call you at work.
Where have you been?

1068
01:15:35,375 --> 01:15:37,957
- Bruce, Dougie's in hospital.
- And?

1069
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:40,124
He tried to kill himself.

1070
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:41,790
Slashed his wrists.

1071
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:45,915
He found out about us, Bruce.

1072
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,290
Couldn't take the humiliation
of that and getting suspended.

1073
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:50,082
How's that my fault?
That's all your fault!

1074
01:15:50,166 --> 01:15:54,165
My God, this place fucking stinks.

1075
01:15:54,291 --> 01:15:55,790
I just need you to fucking leave!

1076
01:15:55,916 --> 01:15:57,082
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

1077
01:15:57,208 --> 01:15:59,290
- I wanna turn off the gas for you.
- Chrissie, don't. Chrissie.

1078
01:15:59,416 --> 01:16:02,582
- I wanna turn off the gas for you.
- Chrissie, I need you to leave!

1079
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:09,999
Come on! I wanna turn off
the fucking gas for you!

1080
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:11,790
Fucking...

1081
01:16:12,708 --> 01:16:17,415
Come on, get fucking hard, you silly
wee poof! Come on, get it in!

1082
01:16:17,666 --> 01:16:19,790
Fuck me with that mouse's cock.

1083
01:16:30,708 --> 01:16:34,290
What's wrong?
You're crying like a wee laddie.

1084
01:16:36,375 --> 01:16:39,457
You're no fun any more, Bruce.
You know that?

1085
01:16:40,666 --> 01:16:42,290
I'm not well.

1086
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:44,499
What's wrong with you, man?

1087
01:16:46,916 --> 01:16:48,915
I hear voices, Chrissie.

1088
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,499
I see things, all the time.

1089
01:16:56,791 --> 01:16:58,915
Do you ever hear them?

1090
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,415
What are you on about?

1091
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:04,790
Whatever it is you're taking,
you wanna lay off it.

1092
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:09,290
Life's cruel, Bruce. Life's cruel.

1093
01:17:20,208 --> 01:17:26,207
People ask me, "Carole, how do you and
Bruce keep the spice in your marriage?"

1094
01:17:26,291 --> 01:17:29,915
Well,
I tell them it's really simple.

1095
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,999
- I'm just the ultimate tease.
- "I'm just the ultimate tease.

1096
01:17:33,708 --> 01:17:36,790
"Me and Bruce,
we're not that different.

1097
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:38,499
"We know what we want

1098
01:17:38,583 --> 01:17:40,415
"We know how to get it.

1099
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:44,249
"Like this promotion he's going for.
We both know he'll win.

1100
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:46,332
"And when he does,

1101
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:51,332
"the Robertson household is going
to be one big happy family again.

1102
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,290
"I kid you not."

1103
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,832
You coming for a wee
ride, sweetheart?

1104
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:29,540
I knew I'd seen you before.
The fucking freak from the tunnel.

1105
01:18:50,291 --> 01:18:52,332
You are a sick fairy.

1106
01:18:52,416 --> 01:18:55,415
My husband is Detective
Sergeant Bruce Robertson.

1107
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:38,790
We have to go
all the way with this pig.

1108
01:19:38,916 --> 01:19:40,707
You know what that means, Ocky?

1109
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:44,374
Hey, hold on, hold on, hold on, right.
Wait a minute.

1110
01:19:45,125 --> 01:19:46,999
You can't waste a cop, man.

1111
01:19:49,791 --> 01:19:52,374
You never said you were gonna...

1112
01:19:53,375 --> 01:19:55,874
- Fuck.
- He saw us do the gook, for fuck's sake!

1113
01:19:58,708 --> 01:20:00,915
But dead cunts tell no tales.

1114
01:20:03,208 --> 01:20:07,082
We can torch the place with the
pig in it. Or what's left of him.

1115
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:09,624
Smokey bacon, man.

1116
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:14,915
Get your fucking hands off her stuff!

1117
01:20:16,416 --> 01:20:17,582
You fucking die.

1118
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:23,165
I want to hear you squeal,
like the fucking pig you are.

1119
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:27,124
Get fucking out.

1120
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:30,207
Don't you leave!
Don't you fucking leave!

1121
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:32,457
Don't you leave this fucking room!

1122
01:20:33,416 --> 01:20:35,332
Don't you fucking close that door!
Fuck!

1123
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,124
Why didn't you arrest us
when you had the chance?

1124
01:20:39,375 --> 01:20:42,415
Scared they'd find out
you're a fucking queer?

1125
01:20:42,625 --> 01:20:44,624
- Just you and me, Detective.
- No!

1126
01:20:44,791 --> 01:20:45,957
No!

1127
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:17,332
You see, I've always
hated you fucking pigs.

1128
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:23,999
But not in the normal way your average
low-life scum like me hates them.

1129
01:21:25,708 --> 01:21:28,582
You see, I've always hated them
in a special way.

1130
01:21:31,416 --> 01:21:34,915
But you...
You're different, sweetheart.

1131
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:39,707
I'll make an honest
woman of you yet.

1132
01:21:50,916 --> 01:21:52,415
You thought you could take me, eh?

1133
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:55,415
You sick,

1134
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,915
sexy, wee pansy.

1135
01:23:03,916 --> 01:23:07,332
You really fucked up this time,
didn't you, Bruce?

1136
01:23:15,708 --> 01:23:17,624
Ambulance is on the way, Bruce.

1137
01:23:18,833 --> 01:23:20,332
Don't go.

1138
01:23:21,708 --> 01:23:23,582
Don't go, brother.

1139
01:23:30,583 --> 01:23:34,207
I just wanted to keep her
close to me, you know?

1140
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:01,374
Might not seem appropriate, but...

1141
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:05,165
Happy New Year, Robbo.

1142
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:06,832
Aye, happy New Year.

1143
01:24:09,875 --> 01:24:11,665
Listen, Bruce, um...

1144
01:24:12,916 --> 01:24:16,874
We obviously had to withdraw
your application for the promotion.

1145
01:24:19,041 --> 01:24:21,457
Now is not the right time
for you to meet the board.

1146
01:24:23,166 --> 01:24:24,749
You see that, right?

1147
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:27,374
Aye.

1148
01:24:27,458 --> 01:24:29,915
And you're back in uniform, Bruce.

1149
01:24:30,041 --> 01:24:31,707
It is a demotion.

1150
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:37,582
Of course, Bruce, I don't need to
tell you that obviously I was chuffed

1151
01:24:37,666 --> 01:24:39,040
about the promotion.

1152
01:24:39,791 --> 01:24:42,332
But it has been
a bittersweet experience for me.

1153
01:24:43,166 --> 01:24:47,249
If you hadn't had the...
the issues you've been having,

1154
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:50,040
I'm sure you would have walked it.

1155
01:24:50,166 --> 01:24:52,165
- Aye.
- Aye.

1156
01:24:52,708 --> 01:24:56,415
I suppose everybody feels like this
when they actually get a promotion.

1157
01:24:57,416 --> 01:25:00,874
You know, how best to work
with old mates and all that.

1158
01:25:01,625 --> 01:25:04,207
Your methods and mine
are very different.

1159
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:06,665
And I know we've pulled
some stuff in the past,

1160
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:10,415
but all the coke and the
hookers and stuff...

1161
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:14,415
- That's finito now.
- Aye.

1162
01:25:15,166 --> 01:25:17,415
You understand, little piggy?

1163
01:25:20,166 --> 01:25:21,665
No hard feelings, eh?

1164
01:25:21,833 --> 01:25:24,832
No hard feelings, pal.
Same rules apply.

1165
01:25:28,041 --> 01:25:29,749
Oh, by the way...

1166
01:25:32,458 --> 01:25:34,874
I saw your wee speccy mate Bladesey
down the Lodge.

1167
01:25:34,958 --> 01:25:37,374
The old phantom phone-caller, eh?

1168
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:41,249
We told the sick bastard he's not welcome
at the Craft if he keeps that shite up.

1169
01:25:43,166 --> 01:25:44,749
See you later, then...

1170
01:25:45,541 --> 01:25:46,582
Frank.

1171
01:26:27,333 --> 01:26:28,832
No, don't...

1172
01:26:32,541 --> 01:26:35,957
OK, let's go...
Let's get out of here.

1173
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:37,540
Stacey!

1174
01:26:39,958 --> 01:26:41,165
St...

1175
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:45,790
Hey.

1176
01:26:46,208 --> 01:26:47,707
Oh, shit.

1177
01:26:50,625 --> 01:26:52,582
I'm really sorry for startling you...

1178
01:26:54,958 --> 01:26:56,665
No, it's...

1179
01:26:56,833 --> 01:26:58,749
It's OK. It's...

1180
01:26:58,875 --> 01:27:00,457
It's OK.

1181
01:27:00,958 --> 01:27:03,415
- Are you all right?
- Uh-huh.

1182
01:27:03,541 --> 01:27:06,624
- You look a bit...
- Hmm?

1183
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:09,749
Ah, I'm just, um...

1184
01:27:13,958 --> 01:27:15,249
I'm just undercover.

1185
01:27:15,416 --> 01:27:17,540
I'm on, um, stakeout and...

1186
01:27:18,541 --> 01:27:20,915
You see, there's some really
shifty-looking characters in here tonight

1187
01:27:21,041 --> 01:27:22,957
and I'm just trying to blend in.

1188
01:27:24,041 --> 01:27:28,332
- Come on, Mummy, I'm hungry.
- I better get him home for his dinner.

1189
01:27:28,458 --> 01:27:30,165
Aye, right, of course.

1190
01:27:31,458 --> 01:27:33,415
- I'll see you around, then.
- Don't leave.

1191
01:28:01,458 --> 01:28:06,040
Hi, Detective Robertson,
it's Mary here.

1192
01:28:06,166 --> 01:28:09,624
Sorry, I know it's probably
none of my business, but...

1193
01:28:13,333 --> 01:28:16,415
Look, um, I was just
thinking that maybe

1194
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:18,957
me and Euan could pop round
on our way to the park.

1195
01:29:13,625 --> 01:29:15,165
Right. Bladesey.

1196
01:29:16,375 --> 01:29:19,457
Uh, first things first.

1197
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:27,124
You've really got to get rid
of the double glazing, pal.

1198
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:31,457
Get yourself contact lenses or
something, laser eye treatment

1199
01:29:31,541 --> 01:29:34,915
cos nobody's ever gonna take you seriously
staring through those thick milk bottles.

1200
01:29:38,041 --> 01:29:41,915
Second thing is, you've really
got to try and toughen up.

1201
01:29:42,041 --> 01:29:44,124
Right, you're a nice guy.

1202
01:29:44,916 --> 01:29:47,165
But you're very soft.

1203
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:52,749
Truth is, people are just as scared
of the world as you are.

1204
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:55,040
I'm scared of the world.

1205
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:59,249
I just don't let people
see it, that's all.

1206
01:30:00,666 --> 01:30:03,040
And that's what the games are.

1207
01:30:03,166 --> 01:30:05,790
I kid you not, my
sweet, sweet friend.

1208
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:09,749
You're my best friend.

1209
01:30:11,625 --> 01:30:13,540
My only friend.

1210
01:30:18,166 --> 01:30:20,124
Most important thing is this, though.

1211
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:23,249
You've got to make
Bunty want you again.

1212
01:30:23,375 --> 01:30:25,874
You'll probably find
that she does actually like you

1213
01:30:25,958 --> 01:30:29,499
if you just asserted yourself
a wee bit more.

1214
01:30:30,166 --> 01:30:33,665
You know, you show her passion
and she will run to you.

1215
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:36,624
She will love you until
the day you die.

1216
01:30:38,916 --> 01:30:43,332
I may not be the one to be
giving marriage counselling,

1217
01:30:43,458 --> 01:30:47,415
but sometimes it takes a wrongdoer
to show you when you're doing wrong.

1218
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:50,457
I'm sorry, Bladesey.

1219
01:30:52,625 --> 01:30:54,165
Really sorry, pal.

1220
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:03,457
Bunty!

1221
01:31:49,333 --> 01:31:51,165
Same rules apply.
