1
00:00:49,618 --> 00:00:52,314
BoY:
For those of you out there
less experienced than me...

2
00:00:52,421 --> 00:00:54,389
let me tell you something
about girls.

3
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:57,859
They're basically gross.

4
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,292
See, this is pretty much
black-and-white...

5
00:01:00,396 --> 00:01:01,920
from where I'm standing.

6
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:03,726
Used to be, back in the day...

7
00:01:03,832 --> 00:01:05,857
maybe fiirst or second grade...

8
00:01:05,968 --> 00:01:07,993
popular wisdom was
they gave you cooties.

9
00:01:08,103 --> 00:01:09,229
Cooties?

10
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:12,205
She touched me! Cooties!

11
00:01:12,308 --> 00:01:13,434
Don't touch me!

12
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:16,670
Cooties!
He has cooties!

13
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:19,771
We didn't know what cooties
were exactly.

14
00:01:19,882 --> 00:01:23,318
But the general feeling was,
if a girl touched you...

15
00:01:23,419 --> 00:01:25,444
some very, very bad things
were gonna happen.

16
00:01:27,656 --> 00:01:30,216
( girls scream )

17
00:01:35,331 --> 00:01:36,992
How right we were.

18
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:38,088
( retching )

19
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,497
This is me now.

20
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:41,569
I've been in love for
two-and-a-half weeks...

21
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,164
and it's a pain I wouldn't wish
on my worst enemies.

22
00:01:46,275 --> 00:01:47,401
( sobbing )

23
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:49,136
I'm not going
to dress this up pretty.

24
00:01:49,244 --> 00:01:50,711
just about everything I know
about women...

25
00:01:50,813 --> 00:01:54,579
love, and the birds
and the frickin'bees...

26
00:01:54,683 --> 00:01:56,048
I've learned in the past

27
00:01:56,151 --> 00:01:57,209
two-and-a-half weeks.

28
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,877
But, when
you're ten years old...

29
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:01,047
( wailing ):
Rosemary...!

30
00:02:01,156 --> 00:02:03,784
...two-and-a-half weeks
can be a lifetime.

31
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:07,453
( pop )

32
00:02:34,223 --> 00:02:38,216
( continues )

33
00:03:02,151 --> 00:03:04,483
( continues )

34
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:21,301
( song ends )

35
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:23,963
BoY:
okay, here's the deal.

36
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:26,268
If you came to hear some
great New York love story...

37
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,364
keep walkin;

38
00:03:27,476 --> 00:03:28,875
You want a real love story?

39
00:03:28,977 --> 00:03:30,410
I'll tell you a real one.

40
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:35,141
My parents. Camp Annawanna.
Catskill Mountains, 1 984.

41
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,153
My father was 1 9,
and a star sports counselor.

42
00:03:40,255 --> 00:03:41,552
My mom was a CIT.

43
00:03:41,657 --> 00:03:44,057
People say she reminded
them of Sissy Spacek.

44
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:49,887
What happened under
that harvest moon that summer...

45
00:03:49,998 --> 00:03:52,159
that's the stuff oflegend.

46
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:54,997
In my family, it's what
we like to refer to as

47
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:58,232
ancient history.

48
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,205
These days, my dad's

49
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:02,436
sleeping on the couch.

50
00:04:02,544 --> 00:04:03,670
Due to this unusual quirk

51
00:04:03,779 --> 00:04:05,178
in the New York State
divorce code...

52
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,511
Neither one of my parents
could move out of our apartment

53
00:04:08,617 --> 00:04:12,713
until their settlement is
signed, sealed and delivered.

54
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:15,289
Needless to say,
it doesn't make for

55
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,415
the greatest living
environment.

56
00:04:17,526 --> 00:04:18,857
Did you drink my Pepsi?

57
00:04:18,961 --> 00:04:20,155
It was my Pepsi.

58
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:21,627
It had my name on it.

59
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,288
Especially since my mom's

60
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:25,025
- ( phone rings )
- recently decided to start dating again.

61
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:27,125
Hello.

62
00:04:27,236 --> 00:04:28,464
MAN:
Leslie.

63
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,128
Is there anYThing worse

64
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:31,968
than being mistaken
for your mother?

65
00:04:32,074 --> 00:04:33,701
No, this is Gabe.

66
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:35,208
Hey, sorry, big guy.

67
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,470
You two sound so much alike.

68
00:04:36,578 --> 00:04:38,409
Is your mom around?
This is Ronny.

69
00:04:38,514 --> 00:04:42,575
LESLI E:
Uh, I've got it, honey.
You can hang up.

70
00:04:42,684 --> 00:04:46,518
Now that's a real love story.

71
00:04:46,622 --> 00:04:49,955
This much I know fiirsthand-
love ends.

72
00:04:50,058 --> 00:04:51,218
You want proof?.

73
00:04:51,326 --> 00:04:53,794
Check out my parents'
refrigerator.

74
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:54,920
( crying )

75
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,429
Why did I ever have to discover

76
00:04:56,532 --> 00:05:00,127
this ridiculous pain
inside of me?

77
00:05:00,235 --> 00:05:02,999
Because two and a half
weeks ago...

78
00:05:03,105 --> 00:05:05,630
before all this love nonsense-

79
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:08,107
and I'm notjust saying
this either-

80
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,178
now, before all this,
I was happy.

81
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,246
( sobbing ):
No!

82
00:05:11,346 --> 00:05:12,870
Truly happy.

83
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:15,074
- ( playing dixieland )
- I'm serious.

84
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:17,482
My life was fiilled with song...

85
00:05:17,586 --> 00:05:19,986
and sport...

86
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:21,885
and constant adventure.

87
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,424
( tires squealing
on video game )

88
00:05:24,526 --> 00:05:27,290
oh, Rosemary.

89
00:05:27,396 --> 00:05:30,490
Rosemary, Rosemary, Rosemary.

90
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:32,567
Why did you ever have
to come into my life?

91
00:05:32,668 --> 00:05:34,932
Who am I kidding?

92
00:05:35,037 --> 00:05:39,030
She's been in my life
for as long as I can remember.

93
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:41,609
For one little stretch there,
during kindergarten...

94
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,904
( children laughing )

95
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:44,672
...you might even say
we were friends.

96
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,304
What are you kids
doing under there?

97
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:52,019
That was before fiirst grade...

98
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,985
and the Iron Curtain came down.

99
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:55,750
Girls on one side...

100
00:05:55,857 --> 00:05:57,654
boys on the other.

101
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:02,797
oh, she was still there,
of course.

102
00:06:02,898 --> 00:06:04,889
I have the class pictures
to prove it.

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,491
I just didn't see her.

104
00:06:07,603 --> 00:06:11,835
I lived in a world of men.

105
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,305
So, who wants to
go to Duane Reade?

106
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:15,808
Man, I am not helping you
steal Kit-Kats again, Max.

107
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:17,344
MAN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Watch it!

108
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:18,413
But you got no
trouble eating

109
00:06:18,513 --> 00:06:20,538
the candy I provide
for ya, do ya?

110
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:22,981
I'm not doin' look-out.
I'm sorry, guys.

111
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:25,178
Hey, guys, it's 5:00.
I gotta roll.

112
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:26,652
I thought we were
gonna shoot some 21 ?

113
00:06:26,755 --> 00:06:28,689
No, I'm meeting my dad
for football practice.

114
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,758
See you guys later.

115
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:32,724
MAX:
The two of you are
so nuts, man.

116
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:35,160
See, my father and I
have this sort of plan.

117
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:38,995
- I'm gonna be the Tiger Woods
of the placekicking world.
- Nice! Nice!

118
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:41,126
- Yeah!
- And he's gonna be my Earl.

119
00:06:41,236 --> 00:06:42,168
See what I'm saying.

120
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:44,136
If you dedicate yourself
to one goal...

121
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:46,230
and one goal only,
at a ridiculously young age...

122
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:48,206
history has taught us
we can achieve anything, champ.

123
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,208
Get back there.

124
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:50,300
one, two, three, four...

125
00:06:50,412 --> 00:06:51,572
You see, before
Rosemary Telesco...

126
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,648
- Nice and easy.
- I had a very fulfiilling life.

127
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:54,681
Nice.

128
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:56,614
oh, how'd it get so late?

129
00:06:56,718 --> 00:06:58,913
Your mother's going to have
dinner waiting for you.

130
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:00,818
What do you say
we stop by Patsy's

131
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:02,184
and get a couple of slices?

132
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,815
Can I take karate?

133
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:04,949
Karate?

134
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,527
It's a martial art.

135
00:07:06,628 --> 00:07:08,459
What does karate have to
do with placekicking?

136
00:07:08,563 --> 00:07:09,757
I don't know.
It can't hurt.

137
00:07:09,865 --> 00:07:10,889
Well, how much is it?

138
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:12,091
I can?

139
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,327
If it doesn't cost
me an arm and a leg.

140
00:07:14,436 --> 00:07:16,495
It might help your
flexibility- sure.

141
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:18,095
Mistake number one
was ever taking

142
00:07:18,206 --> 00:07:19,867
that godforsaken class.

143
00:07:19,975 --> 00:07:22,603
TEACHER:
Karate is not
about strength.

144
00:07:26,648 --> 00:07:28,582
It's about skill.
It's about focus.

145
00:07:28,684 --> 00:07:30,845
( door opens, bell dings )

146
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:32,283
It's an art
of determination.

147
00:07:32,387 --> 00:07:34,753
When she showed up
that fiirst day...

148
00:07:34,856 --> 00:07:36,881
Sorry, my tap
class ran late.

149
00:07:36,992 --> 00:07:38,687
I was actually kind of glad,
you know?

150
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:41,957
A familiar face and all that.

151
00:07:43,265 --> 00:07:45,062
I didn't know anybody else

152
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:47,226
in the class.

153
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,039
If you can master
the art of karate...

154
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:55,507
you can master anything.

155
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,305
Come on. Hai.!

156
00:07:58,914 --> 00:08:03,613
( teacher shouts instruction,
class shouts response )

157
00:08:07,422 --> 00:08:08,889
You're each going to progress
through this course

158
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,480
at your own pace.

159
00:08:10,592 --> 00:08:14,790
Those of you who pass the test
to get your yellow belts...

160
00:08:14,896 --> 00:08:15,794
will be given yellow.

161
00:08:15,897 --> 00:08:19,924
Those who pass red, red.

162
00:08:20,035 --> 00:08:24,199
It's about finding
your personal best.

163
00:08:24,306 --> 00:08:26,103
Come on! Hai.!

164
00:08:27,576 --> 00:08:29,339
I want you to pair up.

165
00:08:29,444 --> 00:08:32,174
Everyone gets
a sparring partner.

166
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:35,873
oh, the painful dance
of pairing up.

167
00:08:38,286 --> 00:08:39,810
20 seconds of pure torture.

168
00:08:45,761 --> 00:08:48,321
Now, I didn't want a girl
for a sparring partner.

169
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,556
Would you?

170
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:51,256
Hey.
Hey.

171
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:52,526
( groans quietly )

172
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:53,862
okay...

173
00:08:53,969 --> 00:08:55,266
Ki-yah!

174
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,305
Let me tell you something
about Rosemary Telesco.

175
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:00,500
Rosemary wasn't the prettiest
girl in our class.

176
00:09:00,609 --> 00:09:02,008
That was Madison Shaw.

177
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,010
And she wasn't the second
prettiest, either.

178
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:05,306
That was Vanessa Muir.

179
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:07,678
No, Rosemary was third.

180
00:09:07,783 --> 00:09:09,774
But boy, could that
girl do karate.

181
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:15,181
Ki-yah!

182
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,621
BoY ( in distance ):
Ki-yah!

183
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:17,692
TEACHER:
Keep it tight.

184
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,825
Don't get the wrong idea.

185
00:09:23,932 --> 00:09:25,923
We weren't really friends.

186
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:28,901
We werejust karate friends.

187
00:09:29,004 --> 00:09:31,234
Back at school, nothing
changed, of course.

188
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:33,136
As far as the rest of the world

189
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:34,970
was concerned, the real world...

190
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:37,544
that Iron Curtain was
still solid.

191
00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:42,307
But, when we put
on those white robes...

192
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:43,975
we could see past
our many differences

193
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:46,349
and fiight like equals.

194
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:47,444
Ki-yah!

195
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:51,117
There was just
one tiny problem.

196
00:09:51,226 --> 00:09:53,660
I pretty much sucked at karate.

197
00:09:53,762 --> 00:09:55,320
Ki-yah!

198
00:09:57,466 --> 00:10:00,993
We all congratulate
Rosemary Telesco

199
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:02,569
on being the first
in the class

200
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:04,298
to earn her yellow belt.

201
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:06,135
Thank you very much.

202
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:07,765
( speaking Japanese )

203
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:09,434
( repeating Japanese phrase )

204
00:10:09,544 --> 00:10:11,011
Talk about an assault
to everything

205
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:12,238
I knew about the world.

206
00:10:12,347 --> 00:10:13,837
RoSEMARY:
Girls mature faster than boys.

207
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:14,973
That's completely made up.

208
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,607
Boys are so much
more mature than girls.

209
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:18,117
This isn't a matter
of opinion, Gabe.

210
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,312
There were studies.

211
00:10:19,421 --> 00:10:21,548
Girls speak first,
they walk first.

212
00:10:21,656 --> 00:10:23,556
I see it in my little
sister's class.

213
00:10:23,658 --> 00:10:25,125
The boys her age
all seem retarded.

214
00:10:25,227 --> 00:10:27,195
There's absolutely no reason
I shouldn't be able

215
00:10:27,295 --> 00:10:29,263
to get my yellow belt
in just a week.

216
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:30,626
You don't take
it seriously.

217
00:10:30,732 --> 00:10:31,824
I take it seriously.

218
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:33,059
You're not focused.

219
00:10:33,168 --> 00:10:35,159
You think you're
this natural.

220
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,202
You don't practice.

221
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:37,498
I practice.

222
00:10:37,606 --> 00:10:38,732
When?
All the time.

223
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,501
You should practice
with me.

224
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:41,541
You'd get better.

225
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:42,735
Fine. Let's practice.

226
00:10:42,844 --> 00:10:43,776
Name the time.

227
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,039
I don't care.
This afternoon.

228
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:46,875
- Fine.
- Great.

229
00:10:46,982 --> 00:10:48,449
oh, I forgot.

230
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,518
I have this one errand.

231
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:52,109
I'm supposed to be
this flower girl

232
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,244
in a couple of weeks.

233
00:10:53,355 --> 00:10:54,481
And I have this fitting.

234
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:56,147
But, it's going to be,
like, five minutes.

235
00:10:56,258 --> 00:10:57,190
I promise.

236
00:10:57,292 --> 00:10:59,920
GABE:
Classic female move.

237
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:01,393
The bait-and-switch.

238
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:02,485
My mother's tricked me

239
00:11:02,597 --> 00:11:06,055
into many a shoe store
with that one.

240
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:09,136
Is there anYThing worse
than dress shopping?

241
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:10,363
I'm serious.

242
00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:12,406
I would rather have
my toenails peeled off...

243
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:13,735
one by one, with pliers...

244
00:11:13,842 --> 00:11:16,174
than spend fiive minutes
in a dress store.

245
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,472
Boo.

246
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:31,657
( heart beating
gradually faster )

247
00:11:33,261 --> 00:11:37,129
okay, what's going on here?

248
00:11:37,232 --> 00:11:38,961
What the heck is this?

249
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:40,534
oh, my God.

250
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:44,594
What's this feeling
in the pit of my stomach?

251
00:11:44,706 --> 00:11:47,436
Who is this... this...

252
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:50,875
amazing creature before me?

253
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:53,277
What do you think?

254
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:57,681
You are going to be the
prettiest flower girl there.

255
00:11:59,821 --> 00:12:02,881
I'm definitely going
to be the oldest one.

256
00:12:03,024 --> 00:12:05,322
( squeaking ):
Who...

257
00:12:05,427 --> 00:12:07,327
( clears throat )
Um, who's getting married?

258
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:09,056
My mom's sister.

259
00:12:09,164 --> 00:12:11,962
oh, cool.

260
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:13,398
It's kind of weird...

261
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:16,561
'cause she's, like,
seven months pregnant.

262
00:12:16,671 --> 00:12:19,105
In that one moment...

263
00:12:19,207 --> 00:12:21,107
Rosemary Telesco leaped
past Vanessa Muir...

264
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:23,370
past Madison Shaw.

265
00:12:23,478 --> 00:12:28,882
I look at Rosemary
andjust felt so, um, confused.

266
00:12:28,984 --> 00:12:30,417
She's a girl.

267
00:12:30,518 --> 00:12:32,486
I'm supposed to despise girls...

268
00:12:32,587 --> 00:12:34,248
not feel nervous
talking to one.

269
00:12:34,356 --> 00:12:35,880
Not be all tongue-tied.

270
00:12:35,991 --> 00:12:37,982
I mean, this was
Rosemary Telesco.

271
00:12:38,093 --> 00:12:39,685
I knew her since kindergarten.

272
00:12:39,794 --> 00:12:41,523
Whoa!

273
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,790
Just...just
a little rock.

274
00:12:42,897 --> 00:12:44,262
I mean, it's gonna
to be fine.

275
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:45,924
I'm just gonna...
grab my scooter...

276
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:47,433
I'm really cool.
Honestly.

277
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,332
As she took me to practice
karate at her place...

278
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:57,843
one thing became clear.

279
00:12:57,946 --> 00:12:59,811
Rosemary went to PS 87

280
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:02,906
because her parents believed
in public education.

281
00:13:03,018 --> 00:13:04,576
See, believing
in public education

282
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:08,884
wasn't really a luxury
my family could afford.

283
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:09,979
( horse neighs )

284
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:12,616
Don't go to Taos...
not without me.

285
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:14,524
Mr. and Mrs. Telesco,
her parents.

286
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:17,393
They, liked, starred
in this soap opera, Santa Fe...

287
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:19,433
that's on, like, every day.

288
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:21,263
So you know
they had a few bucks.

289
00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:22,427
oh, look at that.

290
00:13:22,537 --> 00:13:23,697
You see that?

291
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:25,932
I knew your folks were going
to keep 'em together.

292
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,065
Didn't I say it?

293
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:28,403
Let's go practice
in my bedroom.

294
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,943
okay.

295
00:13:30,045 --> 00:13:31,637
WoMAN ( on TV):
What do you think
I'm going to say?

296
00:13:31,746 --> 00:13:32,644
oh, come on.

297
00:13:32,747 --> 00:13:34,305
He is no good for you!

298
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,576
Get back in the truck!

299
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:39,142
Ifkarate's all about focus...

300
00:13:39,254 --> 00:13:40,585
Good one.

301
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:42,987
...my focus was all over
that pink room.

302
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:44,456
I mean, there I was...

303
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,685
Ki-yah!

304
00:13:45,794 --> 00:13:47,819
...in the inner sanctum,
alone with her.

305
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:49,521
Ki-yah!

306
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:51,064
Smelling her smell.

307
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,133
( sniffs )

308
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:54,929
What is that, strawberry?

309
00:13:55,036 --> 00:13:57,561
So what made you
take karate?

310
00:13:57,672 --> 00:13:59,230
Uh, made me?!

311
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,807
Daryl Kitzens.

312
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:02,843
Daryl Kitzens made
you take karate?

313
00:14:02,944 --> 00:14:04,343
Yeah, have you seen the guy?

314
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:05,435
He's insane.

315
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:07,777
Daryl Kitzens is
without a doubt

316
00:14:07,882 --> 00:14:09,975
the scariest kid
in the Upper West Side.

317
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:11,814
- Ugh!
- He's a fiifth grader...

318
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,410
but he's supposed to be
in seventh.

319
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:14,647
He is a giant.

320
00:14:14,756 --> 00:14:18,021
Held back two grades
out ofhis fiirst fiive.

321
00:14:18,126 --> 00:14:19,650
At the rate he's going,
he'll graduate

322
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:21,285
from high school at the age 2 7.

323
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:23,193
And he'll have terrorized
an entire generation

324
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:24,458
of Upper West Siders.

325
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,261
( grunts )

326
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:29,359
Are you afraid he's going
to beat you up?

327
00:14:29,471 --> 00:14:31,803
No, no, no, no.
of course not.

328
00:14:31,906 --> 00:14:33,771
I just, you know,
want to be ready

329
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,002
when that day comes, you know.

330
00:14:36,111 --> 00:14:38,272
Who was I kidding?
I was petrified.

331
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:41,109
Kitzens hangs out a lot
in front of the subway station

332
00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:44,617
on 7 2nd & Broadway.

333
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:47,984
I haven't walked past
that corner since october.

334
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:49,681
Well, we should practice more.

335
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,816
Yeah, sure. Let's go.

336
00:14:51,926 --> 00:14:54,451
We need to start working
on those maneuvers he taught us.

337
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:56,655
Well, I kind of meant
some other time.

338
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:57,993
It's getting kind of late.

339
00:14:58,099 --> 00:14:59,157
( laughs ):
oh.

340
00:14:59,267 --> 00:15:00,427
Yeah, that sounds great.

341
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:02,799
Uh, it's getting kind
of late anyway, so...

342
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:04,303
Yeah.

343
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:07,340
How could I have said that?

344
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:08,704
okay,just shake it off.

345
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,175
Keep it together.

346
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:11,176
( thud )

347
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,211
Are you okay?

348
00:15:12,313 --> 00:15:13,746
That's the, uh, the-the door.

349
00:15:16,151 --> 00:15:18,346
Look at her.

350
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:20,580
Living this perfect life
up here.

351
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:22,781
With a view of the park
and everything.

352
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:24,518
Yet, she's so humble.

353
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:25,957
Suddenly...

354
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,995
Rosemary's whole world
seemed very attractive to me.

355
00:15:29,097 --> 00:15:31,156
Her parents,
with all their success...

356
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:33,700
the nanny who's been with her
since she was born...

357
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:35,702
and the adopted
three-year-old sister...

358
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:38,102
rescued from an orphanage
in Beijing.

359
00:15:38,206 --> 00:15:39,571
And me.

360
00:15:39,674 --> 00:15:41,938
My family's on a one-way ticket
to TheJerry Springer Show.

361
00:15:42,043 --> 00:15:44,102
- Hi.
- Hi.

362
00:15:44,212 --> 00:15:46,077
Um, is Leslie around?

363
00:15:46,181 --> 00:15:47,409
Uh, yeah.

364
00:15:47,515 --> 00:15:49,813
ADAM:
Les, your date's here!

365
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:53,949
She's coming.
I'm her...

366
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:56,751
( clears throat ):
...husband.

367
00:15:56,858 --> 00:15:58,621
( banging and blurping
on video game )

368
00:15:58,726 --> 00:16:01,559
only 20 more minutes
of video, okay, hon?

369
00:16:01,663 --> 00:16:02,595
Bedtime soon.

370
00:16:02,697 --> 00:16:03,595
All right.

371
00:16:03,698 --> 00:16:04,892
Good night.

372
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:06,591
( Adam clears throat )

373
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:07,861
( soft chuckle )

374
00:16:07,969 --> 00:16:09,561
Adam, Ronny.
Ronny, Adam.

375
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:11,468
- You guys met?
- Yeah, yeah, we met. At the door.

376
00:16:11,573 --> 00:16:13,200
- ( mutters )
- okay, good. Shall we, uh... Let's...

377
00:16:13,308 --> 00:16:15,299
GABE:
See this divorce thing...

378
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,377
You guys have fun.
Thank you.

379
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:17,671
okay.

380
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:19,838
...it's a very difficult
situation for everyone.

381
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:21,882
This isn't anybody's
fault, you know.

382
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:23,473
It's not anybody's fault.

383
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:27,214
It's just that
your father and I

384
00:16:27,322 --> 00:16:28,983
are a lot more different
than we thought.

385
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,853
They'rejust very
different people.

386
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,392
( crying )

387
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:33,858
Even though
I was just nine and a half...

388
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:37,454
I totally took it like a man.

389
00:16:37,565 --> 00:16:40,329
Now, I'm not saying
I'm some latch-key kid.

390
00:16:40,435 --> 00:16:42,266
I mean, I don't want
to make it seem

391
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,632
like my parents are
irresponsible, either.

392
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:44,898
But, for a year now...

393
00:16:45,006 --> 00:16:47,270
I've been able
to roam the city.

394
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,776
Well, okay...

395
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,906
not really the city-
nine square blocks.

396
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:56,984
The planetarium to the north...

397
00:16:57,085 --> 00:16:59,246
Riverside Park to the west...

398
00:16:59,354 --> 00:17:02,448
Central Park to the east
and 7 2nd Street to the south.

399
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:06,823
( alternative )

400
00:17:06,928 --> 00:17:09,158
In those blocks,
I own this town.

401
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:21,501
( continues )

402
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:22,769
Rosemary lived on 8 1 st Street

403
00:17:22,877 --> 00:17:27,507
near the park, a few yards
north of my territory.

404
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:29,810
When I started,you know...

405
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:31,852
casually riding
past her building...

406
00:17:31,953 --> 00:17:34,217
I was heading
into some uncharted waters.

407
00:17:34,322 --> 00:17:39,851
( continues )

408
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:41,428
It was summer break.

409
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:43,292
our next karate class wasn't
for three days.

410
00:17:43,398 --> 00:17:45,832
Do you know
how many Telescos there are

411
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:48,835
in the Manhattan phone book?
Two.

412
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:50,598
- ( phone ringing )
- Telesco's.

413
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:52,002
one's a butcher shop

414
00:17:52,106 --> 00:17:53,733
down in the Village.

415
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:54,865
Rosemary?

416
00:17:54,976 --> 00:17:58,036
Nah, there's no
Rosemary here.

417
00:17:58,146 --> 00:17:59,477
And trust me...

418
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,842
( buzzing ):
This is Frank.

419
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:03,179
...the other was
not her, either.

420
00:18:03,284 --> 00:18:06,310
Hi. Is, uh, R-Rosemary there?

421
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:09,015
You're the kid that called
a half an hour ago.

422
00:18:09,123 --> 00:18:11,353
What was I to do...

423
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:15,020
except loiter and hope.

424
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:22,565
Uh-oh, her doorman's
looking at me.

425
00:18:26,374 --> 00:18:29,070
oh, my God, there she is.

426
00:18:29,177 --> 00:18:31,702
I didn't have
a contingency plan for if

427
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:33,212
I actually saw her.

428
00:18:33,314 --> 00:18:34,838
just go up to her.

429
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:38,112
Go, go. Say hi to her.

430
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:40,813
( song ends with needle scratching )

431
00:18:40,922 --> 00:18:43,413
She looked so busy.
I-I'll talk to her another day.

432
00:18:43,524 --> 00:18:45,890
Coward. You fool.
How could you be so weak?

433
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:48,428
I-I'm not weak. I'm only human.

434
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:50,360
What was I going to say?
I was in the neighborhood?

435
00:18:50,465 --> 00:18:51,557
That's pathetic.

436
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,395
No,you're weak,
and you're pathetic...

437
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:55,594
and you're going to be alone
your entire life.

438
00:18:55,703 --> 00:18:57,102
Who cares?

439
00:18:57,205 --> 00:18:59,230
I'd rather be alone than endure
this misery and torment.

440
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:01,975
Whoa!
ooh!

441
00:19:03,177 --> 00:19:04,405
Hey, watch it, child!

442
00:19:04,512 --> 00:19:05,570
Gabe?

443
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,672
oh, uh, hi.

444
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:09,772
How's-How's it going?

445
00:19:09,884 --> 00:19:11,476
( stammering ):
I was just, you know...

446
00:19:11,586 --> 00:19:12,780
in the neighborhood.

447
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:14,821
Don't you live
in the neighborhood?

448
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:18,085
Well, 73rd & West End.

449
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:22,060
I-I guess it sort of depends on
how the neighborhood is defined.

450
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:24,063
Mm-hmm.

451
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:26,360
Can I sound like anymore
of a loser?

452
00:19:26,467 --> 00:19:28,560
So, um, what are you guys up to?

453
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:31,331
Well, my sister's got
a birthday party in the park.

454
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:33,464
I'm just bringing my book.

455
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:34,734
Want to come?

456
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,935
Uh, come?

457
00:19:39,514 --> 00:19:40,811
Uh, sure.

458
00:19:40,915 --> 00:19:43,008
( kids laughing,
talking happily )

459
00:19:44,752 --> 00:19:46,720
MAN:
Yeah, run.

460
00:19:48,423 --> 00:19:50,152
Sorry you came?

461
00:19:50,258 --> 00:19:52,283
Not yet.

462
00:19:52,393 --> 00:19:53,951
Bubbles.

463
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:55,461
Bubbles, yeah.

464
00:19:55,563 --> 00:19:57,497
Look...
Look, there's my point.

465
00:19:57,598 --> 00:19:59,589
Those two kids are
the same age- she's...

466
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,498
like, talking, using her hands,
telling stories...

467
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:04,537
and he's drooling
over a cupcake.

468
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:06,573
They're not the same age.

469
00:20:06,674 --> 00:20:07,902
How much you
want to bet?

470
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:10,307
A buck says he's six months
younger than her.

471
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:11,605
Buy me an ice cream?

472
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,270
No, you're buying me one.

473
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:14,541
Excuse me?

474
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:15,741
Uh-huh.

475
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,112
Is that your son?

476
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:18,150
Yeah.

477
00:20:18,252 --> 00:20:19,549
How old is he?

478
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:22,179
He's two and a half.

479
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,314
And that little girl...

480
00:20:23,424 --> 00:20:24,857
do you know
how old she is?

481
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,654
She's three months
younger.

482
00:20:30,064 --> 00:20:31,827
That proves nothing.

483
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:34,197
Man, look at her.

484
00:20:34,302 --> 00:20:36,736
Have you ever seen anyone
more beautiful?

485
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:37,997
So smart, too.

486
00:20:38,106 --> 00:20:40,267
She's just my type.

487
00:20:40,374 --> 00:20:41,398
Wow.

488
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:44,569
I didn't even know
I had a type.

489
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:46,670
Now if I could only shake
the nanny...

490
00:20:46,781 --> 00:20:48,408
we'd be in business.

491
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:51,713
So, um, should we get
that ice cream now?

492
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:52,945
Now?

493
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:55,454
Well I mean, sure,
if-if you want one.

494
00:20:55,556 --> 00:20:58,423
Birdie, can we go get
an ice cream?

495
00:20:58,526 --> 00:21:00,016
Yep. Hurry back now.

496
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:01,789
Uh, no, thanks.

497
00:21:01,896 --> 00:21:05,161
Unfortunately,
this one's on me.

498
00:21:05,266 --> 00:21:08,030
( chuckles )

499
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:09,433
My fiirst date.

500
00:21:09,537 --> 00:21:10,765
The big spender.

501
00:21:10,872 --> 00:21:12,897
Haagen-Dazs all the way, baby.

502
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:17,501
So, how come I have nothing
to say to her?

503
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:20,513
Why isn't she looking at me?

504
00:21:20,615 --> 00:21:22,480
Am I that hideous?

505
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,346
Do I smell?

506
00:21:24,452 --> 00:21:26,249
You, um, come here often?

507
00:21:26,354 --> 00:21:28,584
Central Park?

508
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:29,986
Um, yeah.

509
00:21:30,091 --> 00:21:32,184
What kind of question is that?

510
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:33,453
I hate myself.

511
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:35,426
I live across the street,
you know.

512
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,724
You?

513
00:21:36,831 --> 00:21:37,820
Me?

514
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:39,263
Are you more Riverside?

515
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:41,358
Yeah, I'm more
of a Riverside guy.

516
00:21:41,469 --> 00:21:44,529
That's really the
park, but Central
Park's pretty cool.

517
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:46,197
I've done my time here.

518
00:21:46,307 --> 00:21:47,205
Hey, Strawberry Fields.

519
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:48,798
Do you know what
it's named for?

520
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,810
Some Beatles song, right?

521
00:21:50,912 --> 00:21:53,244
Close. It's actually
the name of the orphanage

522
00:21:53,347 --> 00:21:54,473
in Liverpool where
John Lennon

523
00:21:54,582 --> 00:21:56,447
used to play with his
friends who lived there.

524
00:21:56,551 --> 00:21:58,018
- Really?
- Yeah.

525
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,780
I didn't know that. Neat.

526
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:01,650
I took Rosemary on a tour
of the park

527
00:22:01,756 --> 00:22:03,690
that would make your head spin.

528
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,225
This is my Central Park,
my New York.

529
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:07,419
Yeah, they used
to have herds

530
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:08,654
and hundreds
and hundreds

531
00:22:08,763 --> 00:22:10,731
of sheep grazing
in these fields.

532
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:12,822
And then they gave
the sheepherder a job

533
00:22:12,934 --> 00:22:14,834
in the zoo at
the Lion House.

534
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:18,099
oh, yeah, didn't the sheepherder
used to live, up in the top...

535
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:24,236
( pop )

536
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,817
( continues )

537
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:34,979
See those
buildings up there?

538
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:36,852
When I was younger,
I used to pretend

539
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,755
they were pirate ships,
and I'd fight 'em.

540
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,884
I never took you
for a pirate guy.

541
00:22:40,995 --> 00:22:43,054
Well, I outgrew
that eventually.

542
00:22:43,164 --> 00:22:44,426
( continues )

543
00:23:03,818 --> 00:23:08,278
( continues )

544
00:23:16,664 --> 00:23:19,394
( song ends )

545
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,400
That's where my aunt's
getting married next week.

546
00:23:21,502 --> 00:23:24,300
GABE:
oh, the boathouse, of course.

547
00:23:24,405 --> 00:23:26,202
Flower girl.

548
00:23:26,307 --> 00:23:29,071
Ah, I'm so looking
forward to that.

549
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:32,634
My aunt asked me to be
her flower girl when I was four...

550
00:23:32,747 --> 00:23:34,647
but, little did any
of us know...

551
00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:37,513
it'd take seven years for her
boyfriend to pop the question.

552
00:23:37,618 --> 00:23:39,051
That's hilarious.

553
00:23:39,153 --> 00:23:41,485
I was charming and suave.

554
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:43,819
Everything you could hope to be
on your fiirst real date.

555
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:45,357
Maybe we should practice
more karate.

556
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:46,653
You need it.

557
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:48,695
I am this close
to becoming a yellow belt.

558
00:23:48,796 --> 00:23:50,457
Try this close.

559
00:23:50,564 --> 00:23:52,122
What's tomorrow
like for you?

560
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:54,201
Saturday, um...

561
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:56,065
I've got cello
in the morning.

562
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,604
And in the afternoon
I've got tap.

563
00:23:58,706 --> 00:24:00,071
Tap. What time
does tap end?

564
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:01,402
I'm sorry.

565
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:04,000
After tap, I've got this
Indian Princess thing

566
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:05,305
I do with my father.

567
00:24:05,413 --> 00:24:07,779
Geez, it was easier
scheduling Arab-Israeli

568
00:24:07,882 --> 00:24:09,713
peace talks that making
a date with this girl.

569
00:24:09,817 --> 00:24:11,011
What's Indian Princess?

570
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:12,676
It's this
""Daddy and Me'' thing.

571
00:24:12,787 --> 00:24:14,254
Don't ask.

572
00:24:14,355 --> 00:24:17,654
I just do it so he won't feel
guilty working late all week.

573
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:18,747
How about Sunday?

574
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:19,883
Sunday's good.

575
00:24:19,994 --> 00:24:21,086
Morning?

576
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:22,526
In the morning
I have a tutor.

577
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,222
But how about the afternoon?

578
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:26,357
Tutor? What kind
of tutor?

579
00:24:26,467 --> 00:24:28,935
It's for the ERBs.

580
00:24:29,036 --> 00:24:32,369
My parents want me to go
to Ethical Culture next year.

581
00:24:32,473 --> 00:24:34,100
or Trinity.

582
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:36,904
Private school?
Really?

583
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:39,775
I probably won't get in
anywhere.

584
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,144
Maybe I'll throw the test.

585
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:45,241
Whoa. What exactly
did that mean?

586
00:24:45,353 --> 00:24:46,752
Was that some kind of sign?

587
00:24:46,854 --> 00:24:48,947
She'd throw her test for me?

588
00:24:49,056 --> 00:24:50,751
Does she like like me?

589
00:24:50,858 --> 00:24:52,519
You nearly gave me
a heart attack.

590
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:53,615
Where were you, girl?

591
00:24:53,728 --> 00:24:55,127
I'm sorry. We were...

592
00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:56,594
Sorry ain't good enough.

593
00:24:56,697 --> 00:24:58,130
You're 1 1 years old.

594
00:24:58,232 --> 00:24:59,256
This is New York City.

595
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:01,767
You can't go off running
by yourself like that.

596
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:03,666
You want Birdie telling
your parents on you, huh?

597
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:05,830
Now you two
say your good-byes now.

598
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,498
Sunday afternoon?

599
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:08,905
Sounds good.

600
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:11,068
Maybe I should come
to your place.

601
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:13,043
Um, my place?

602
00:25:13,147 --> 00:25:15,638
See, ever since my dad moved
onto the couch...

603
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,082
I've been a little uninterested
in having friends over.

604
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:19,482
Perfect.

605
00:25:19,587 --> 00:25:20,611
See you then.

606
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:22,018
BI RDI E:
Come on. Let's go.

607
00:25:22,123 --> 00:25:24,421
Here.
Running off like that.

608
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:25,719
You know better than that.

609
00:25:28,896 --> 00:25:31,023
Never had I felt so alive.!

610
00:25:31,132 --> 00:25:33,965
I had a date with Rosemary.

611
00:25:34,068 --> 00:25:36,832
( alternative )

612
00:25:42,576 --> 00:25:45,044
( song ends )

613
00:25:45,146 --> 00:25:46,773
Was there any better age to be

614
00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:49,714
in any better city
in the world?

615
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:52,479
Sunday couldn't come
fast enough.

616
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:53,484
What was today?

617
00:25:53,587 --> 00:25:55,748
only Friday?

618
00:25:55,856 --> 00:25:57,187
oh, the eternity.

619
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:58,849
Whoa! Hey! Watch
where you're going!

620
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:01,450
- Get off the sidewalk, you maniac!
- Sorry!

621
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:06,896
Hey, how goes it,
Mr. Gabe?

622
00:26:07,001 --> 00:26:08,969
Pretty fine, Ralph.

623
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:10,832
How's it coming along
with that placekicking?

624
00:26:10,938 --> 00:26:12,064
Placekicking?

625
00:26:12,173 --> 00:26:13,970
I'm actually more into
karate these days.

626
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:15,302
- Karate?
- Yeah.

627
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:17,570
You've got to watch this show,
Extreme Martial Arts

628
00:26:17,678 --> 00:26:19,646
with this guy,
Mike Chatterandabut.

629
00:26:19,747 --> 00:26:21,146
- Mike...?
- Mike Chat. oh!

630
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:22,180
- Mike Chat.
- Yeah.

631
00:26:22,283 --> 00:26:23,682
All right, cool.
I'll check it out.

632
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:25,149
Hold the door, please.

633
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:26,719
oh, sure.
No problem, Lina.

634
00:26:26,821 --> 00:26:28,186
That's what
I'm here for, right?

635
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:30,120
Thank you so much,
Ralph.

636
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:48,241
Thank you.

637
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:49,400
Sure.

638
00:26:51,212 --> 00:26:53,043
New au pair in 3-G.

639
00:26:53,147 --> 00:26:54,205
She's from Stockholm.

640
00:26:54,315 --> 00:26:55,873
Gotcha.

641
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:01,018
ANNoUNCER:
Mike Chat knows that showmanship is huge

642
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:02,850
in the martial arts tournaments.

643
00:27:02,957 --> 00:27:06,916
In fact, Mike's
the Tony Hawk of martial arts...

644
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:09,154
- the guy who changed the game...
- ( grunts )

645
00:27:09,263 --> 00:27:10,958
and he's master teacher...

646
00:27:11,065 --> 00:27:14,034
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

647
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:17,592
- Mike pioneered XMA-
Extreme Martial Arts.
- ( karate yells )

648
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:19,696
He's rooted in the fundamentals.

649
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:20,865
Ki-yah!

650
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:22,101
( glass breaking )

651
00:27:24,178 --> 00:27:25,645
Hey, um, Mom?

652
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:27,805
Hey.

653
00:27:27,915 --> 00:27:31,646
I was thinking
I kind of need a haircut.

654
00:27:31,752 --> 00:27:32,878
A haircut?

655
00:27:32,987 --> 00:27:33,976
Yeah.

656
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:35,988
okay, I'll do it in the morning.

657
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,491
See, this was a sensitive
subject around our house...

658
00:27:39,593 --> 00:27:40,491
because, up until now...

659
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:42,459
my mom's actually given me

660
00:27:42,563 --> 00:27:43,928
every haircut I've ever had.

661
00:27:44,031 --> 00:27:46,659
Not to say she hasn't learned
a thing or two over the years.

662
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:49,167
But, lately,
it's been occurring to me

663
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:52,967
that she's not exactly what
we might call a professional.

664
00:27:53,107 --> 00:27:57,339
A-Actually I was, you know,
kind of thinking

665
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:59,241
maybe we could go out for one.

666
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:00,313
out?

667
00:28:00,414 --> 00:28:01,346
Yeah, you know, like...

668
00:28:01,448 --> 00:28:03,507
to a barbershop.

669
00:28:03,617 --> 00:28:06,108
You mean pay for it?

670
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,847
Well, not an expensive one.

671
00:28:07,955 --> 00:28:09,354
Don't be ridiculous, honey.

672
00:28:09,456 --> 00:28:10,548
I can cut your hair.

673
00:28:13,661 --> 00:28:14,685
Hey, Dad.

674
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:16,820
I really think it's time

675
00:28:16,931 --> 00:28:18,796
that Mom stops cutting my hair.

676
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:19,888
Don't you?

677
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:23,100
Think about Giambi.

678
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:24,727
I don't trust that damn guy.

679
00:28:24,838 --> 00:28:26,499
I don't trust him
guarding that bag.

680
00:28:26,607 --> 00:28:30,134
He's got bat,
no doubt about that.

681
00:28:30,244 --> 00:28:32,041
What do you think we ought to do
with this guy...

682
00:28:32,146 --> 00:28:33,113
put him on the block
or what?

683
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:34,510
Hey, could you take
it a little higher

684
00:28:34,615 --> 00:28:35,547
over the ears, please?

685
00:28:35,649 --> 00:28:36,843
- No problem.
- Thanks.

686
00:28:36,951 --> 00:28:38,418
Voila.

687
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:40,612
Best $ 1 2 I ever spent.

688
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:41,688
Look at me.

689
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:42,983
I was hot.

690
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:45,122
( grunts )

691
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:46,817
- our ball.
- What the heck?

692
00:28:46,927 --> 00:28:48,656
Hey, man.
It's a legitimate foul.

693
00:28:48,762 --> 00:28:50,662
Dude, you just
totally hacked me.

694
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:52,163
No.

695
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:54,496
Look, I don't need
you losers.

696
00:28:54,602 --> 00:28:56,968
okay, maybe I was
a little excitable.

697
00:28:57,071 --> 00:28:59,164
But I didn't want to get
bruised up

698
00:28:59,273 --> 00:29:00,865
before my big karate practice.

699
00:29:03,177 --> 00:29:04,075
Hey, Rosemary.

700
00:29:04,178 --> 00:29:05,372
Hey there, pretty lady.

701
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:07,003
How's it going, girl?

702
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:09,275
Hey, Rosemary Telesco.

703
00:29:09,383 --> 00:29:11,044
( intercom buzzes )

704
00:29:11,151 --> 00:29:12,584
I-I got it!

705
00:29:16,724 --> 00:29:18,191
RALPH:
Mr. Gabe...

706
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:20,123
I got a Rosemary
down here for you.

707
00:29:20,227 --> 00:29:23,025
Send her up, Ralph.

708
00:29:24,698 --> 00:29:26,996
I loathed myself
for feeling like I did.

709
00:29:27,101 --> 00:29:29,228
- Hey.
- I mean, this is crazy.

710
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:31,065
She's a girl, for God's sake.

711
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:33,537
It's not like she's
a New York Knick or something.

712
00:29:37,144 --> 00:29:38,042
Hey.

713
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:39,669
Hey.

714
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,407
My mom dropped me off.

715
00:29:41,515 --> 00:29:45,007
She's going to pick me up
at 5:1 5, if that's okay.

716
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,484
Yeah, sure.
Whenever is fine.

717
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:53,725
All right. Let's go.

718
00:29:53,827 --> 00:29:55,988
So, um, do you remember
the old place?

719
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,654
Yeah, it's been
a long time.

720
00:29:57,765 --> 00:29:58,789
Yeah, it has.

721
00:30:03,771 --> 00:30:04,738
oh.

722
00:30:08,242 --> 00:30:10,710
Mom, this is
Rosemary Telesco.

723
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:12,301
You remember her,
don't you?

724
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:14,677
From kindergarten.
of course.

725
00:30:14,782 --> 00:30:18,582
I haven't seen you in forever.

726
00:30:18,686 --> 00:30:21,587
Look at you, Rosie,
you're all grown up.

727
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:23,122
Hi, Mrs. Burton.

728
00:30:23,223 --> 00:30:24,383
We're practicing
karate.

729
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:26,686
( intercom buzzes )

730
00:30:26,794 --> 00:30:28,091
Excuse me.

731
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:30,986
Yes.

732
00:30:31,098 --> 00:30:31,996
RALPH:
Ronny's here.

733
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:33,930
Should I bring him up?

734
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:36,935
oh, um, okay.

735
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:40,573
I...

736
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:42,437
I didn't know you were
having a play date

737
00:30:42,543 --> 00:30:44,704
or I wouldn't have made plans.

738
00:30:44,812 --> 00:30:45,779
Should I stay?

739
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:47,278
It's not a play date, Mom.

740
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:48,473
It's practice.

741
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:50,573
Do you need snacks?

742
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:52,845
No, we're fine, and
don't worry about us.

743
00:30:52,953 --> 00:30:54,011
okay.

744
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:55,918
( doorbell rings )

745
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:57,786
Who's Ronny?

746
00:30:57,891 --> 00:30:59,153
My mom's got
a date.

747
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:03,886
- Um...
- Hey, big guy.

748
00:31:03,997 --> 00:31:07,831
Um, Ronny, this is Gabe's
friend, Rosemary Telesco.

749
00:31:07,935 --> 00:31:09,027
Nice to meet you...

750
00:31:09,136 --> 00:31:10,364
Rosemary Telesco.

751
00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:11,836
You, too.

752
00:31:11,939 --> 00:31:13,668
RALPH:
Uh, do you want me to hold this for you?

753
00:31:13,774 --> 00:31:15,708
oh, thank you.

754
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:17,743
I'll just get my coat.

755
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:22,513
Is there anYThing
more excruciating

756
00:31:22,616 --> 00:31:24,641
than you and your date
and your mom's date

757
00:31:24,752 --> 00:31:27,346
all hanging out
with absolutely nothing to say?

758
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:29,854
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

759
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:31,788
okay, kiddo?

760
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:33,951
okay, that's more excruciating.

761
00:31:36,797 --> 00:31:37,786
oh.

762
00:31:37,898 --> 00:31:38,865
I'll, uh...

763
00:31:38,966 --> 00:31:40,900
I'll be back
in time for dinner.

764
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:43,231
- okay.
- okay. ( laughs )

765
00:31:43,337 --> 00:31:44,929
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.

766
00:31:51,612 --> 00:31:53,773
I didn't know your parents
were divorced.

767
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:56,372
Well, they're not,
officially.

768
00:31:56,483 --> 00:31:58,610
See, it's kind of this
long-term project

769
00:31:58,719 --> 00:31:59,617
they've been working on

770
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,210
for, like, a year and a half now...

771
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:02,845
and my mom's
decided that

772
00:32:02,956 --> 00:32:05,322
she's finally got to
move on with her life.

773
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:06,551
That sucks.

774
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,594
Well, it is what
it is, you know?

775
00:32:08,695 --> 00:32:10,856
- Hey, you want to see something funny?
- Mm-hmm.

776
00:32:10,964 --> 00:32:12,261
A few weeks earlier...

777
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:14,459
my mother had left
her Match.com fiile open

778
00:32:14,568 --> 00:32:15,626
on her desktop.

779
00:32:15,736 --> 00:32:16,794
See, this is like a list

780
00:32:16,904 --> 00:32:18,599
of all the 45-year-old
men in New York

781
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:19,899
who are looking for wives.

782
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:23,602
Most of them are looking for
their second or even third.

783
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,439
These are the ones
my mom picked out.

784
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:27,446
They all look like
the same guy to me.

785
00:32:27,548 --> 00:32:29,516
Yeah, she's kind of got a type.

786
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:31,743
oh, my God, there's Ronny.

787
00:32:31,852 --> 00:32:32,944
""I'm a real

788
00:32:33,053 --> 00:32:35,283
""live wire who tends to take
everything in life

789
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:36,515
""up a notch.

790
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:38,887
""I like being quiet
and contemplative...

791
00:32:38,992 --> 00:32:40,289
but rowdy and
spontaneous...''

792
00:32:40,394 --> 00:32:42,419
Enough of my mother
and her romantic dead ends.

793
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:44,793
Today was about me
and Rosemary.

794
00:32:44,898 --> 00:32:47,594
She was in my house, all alone.

795
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:50,192
It was time for us to fiight.

796
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:53,330
- Ki-yah!
-  ( disco )

797
00:33:04,351 --> 00:33:07,582
( continues )

798
00:33:07,688 --> 00:33:08,746
Sparring that day...

799
00:33:08,856 --> 00:33:10,118
I was channeling none other

800
00:33:10,224 --> 00:33:11,782
than the great one himself-

801
00:33:11,892 --> 00:33:13,826
my master, my inspiration-

802
00:33:13,927 --> 00:33:16,487
Mr. Mike Chat.

803
00:33:16,597 --> 00:33:17,791
( yells )

804
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:22,797
It's a dance, Gabriel.

805
00:33:22,903 --> 00:33:24,530
You lead her, not she lead you.

806
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:27,034
Ki-yah!

807
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,300
( continues )

808
00:33:54,468 --> 00:33:57,198
( continues )

809
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,530
Kiss her. Kiss her!

810
00:34:01,642 --> 00:34:03,701
I can't, that's disgusting.

811
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,870
Trust me.
Not disgusting.

812
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:10,139
( continues )

813
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,150
( grunts )

814
00:34:12,252 --> 00:34:14,345
How could you let her do that?

815
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:17,548
Girls mature faster than boys.

816
00:34:17,658 --> 00:34:19,091
Baloney!

817
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:21,057
Don't let her brainwash you
with that.

818
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:22,685
Boys stronger.

819
00:34:22,796 --> 00:34:25,890
I had absolutely no idea
what she was thinking.

820
00:34:25,999 --> 00:34:28,297
She was this total mystery
to me.

821
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:31,371
Did I want to kiss
Rosemary Telesco?

822
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:33,871
Yes, I guess I did.

823
00:34:33,974 --> 00:34:36,408
I wanted to-
more than anYThing on earth.

824
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:41,674
Do you, um...

825
00:34:41,782 --> 00:34:43,579
want...

826
00:34:43,684 --> 00:34:44,981
some Gatorade?

827
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:46,575
( tires screeching,
car crashing, song ends )

828
00:34:46,687 --> 00:34:48,552
Who was I kidding anyway?

829
00:34:48,655 --> 00:34:50,384
Was I really going to kiss her?

830
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:52,856
I mean, come on,
she's 1 1, I'm ten.

831
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,258
Well, 1 0 3/ 4 actually.

832
00:34:55,362 --> 00:34:57,227
She's May, I'm September.

833
00:34:57,331 --> 00:34:59,458
What do all the
different names mean?

834
00:34:59,566 --> 00:35:01,898
oh, it's my mom's stuff
and my dad's stuff.

835
00:35:02,002 --> 00:35:03,299
Wow.

836
00:35:03,403 --> 00:35:04,495
Isn't it hard?

837
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:05,536
oh, no, not really.

838
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,368
I mean, I can choose
from either of them.

839
00:35:07,474 --> 00:35:09,339
No, I mean having them
still living together.

840
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:11,343
I might be falling in love
with the woman...

841
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:13,606
but it doesn't mean I'm
in the mood for soul searching.

842
00:35:13,714 --> 00:35:15,682
Don't you think
it's going to be so much better...

843
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:17,272
once it's all over?

844
00:35:17,384 --> 00:35:18,282
What do you mean?

845
00:35:18,385 --> 00:35:20,512
I don't know, like...

846
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,247
getting your lives
started again.

847
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,889
I guess so, yeah.

848
00:35:24,992 --> 00:35:27,222
Well, who do you think's
going to move out?

849
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:28,658
I don't know.

850
00:35:28,762 --> 00:35:30,593
My dad, I guess.

851
00:35:30,697 --> 00:35:32,722
Has he looked at any places yet?

852
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:34,357
I don't think so.

853
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:35,435
Hey...

854
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:38,126
...maybe we should look for him.

855
00:35:39,172 --> 00:35:40,400
Turns out, Rosemary's parents...

856
00:35:40,507 --> 00:35:43,032
their favorite hobby was
looking at apartments.

857
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:44,735
They never actually
buy anYThing...

858
00:35:44,845 --> 00:35:47,109
but every Sunday, for as long
as she can remember...

859
00:35:47,214 --> 00:35:48,875
they dragged her out
to open houses.

860
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:50,313
She knew what everything meant.

861
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:51,543
""WBF''?!

862
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:52,583
""Wood-burning fireplace.''

863
00:35:52,686 --> 00:35:53,584
That's good.

864
00:35:53,687 --> 00:35:54,654
How much?

865
00:35:54,755 --> 00:35:56,848
Way too expensive,
that's how much.

866
00:35:56,957 --> 00:35:57,924
Yeah.

867
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:00,919
""Estate Condition'' is scary-

868
00:36:01,028 --> 00:36:03,656
it means it has to be gutted.

869
00:36:03,764 --> 00:36:05,755
ooh, this is nice, look.

870
00:36:05,866 --> 00:36:07,595
""Romantic treetop view...

871
00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:09,965
attic loft, hardwood floors.''

872
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,504
It's a little downtown,
but there's two bedrooms...

873
00:36:12,606 --> 00:36:14,164
so you can stay over
whenever you want.

874
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:15,172
Should we call?

875
00:36:15,275 --> 00:36:16,333
Call?

876
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:19,911
MAN ( over phone ):
Hello? Can I help you?

877
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:23,073
Yes. Isaac?
We wanted to, um...

878
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:25,708
arrange to see
the romantic treetop view.

879
00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:27,309
( man speaking over phone,
indistinctly )

880
00:36:27,421 --> 00:36:29,480
Something right in the range
of your place.

881
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:30,578
Yes.

882
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,089
Maybe it is true.

883
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:34,786
Maybe girls do mature
faster than boys.

884
00:36:34,895 --> 00:36:36,328
Could I talk like that?

885
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,489
How is tomorrow afternoon
for you?

886
00:36:38,598 --> 00:36:42,591
Tomorrow for me?
It's, uh...

887
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:44,329
It's good.

888
00:36:44,438 --> 00:36:46,702
Yes, that'd be perfect.

889
00:36:46,807 --> 00:36:50,004
3:00? See you there.

890
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,771
3:00 tomorrow.

891
00:36:51,878 --> 00:36:53,277
Right.

892
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,871
( door opens, closes )

893
00:36:55,982 --> 00:36:56,949
QUick.

894
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:01,180
Here. Hurry. Hurry.

895
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:03,655
ADAM:
Are you back here?

896
00:37:03,757 --> 00:37:05,156
Got some new kicking tees.

897
00:37:05,258 --> 00:37:07,192
They're titanium.

898
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:08,261
oh.

899
00:37:09,763 --> 00:37:11,025
How's it going?

900
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:12,894
Good.

901
00:37:12,999 --> 00:37:15,433
Dad, you remember
Rosemary Telesco, right?

902
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:21,669
From kindergarten. Sure.

903
00:37:21,775 --> 00:37:22,639
Hey.

904
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:26,303
Hi. Long time, no see.

905
00:37:27,647 --> 00:37:29,877
She's in my
karate class, Dad.

906
00:37:29,983 --> 00:37:31,712
Cool.

907
00:37:34,888 --> 00:37:37,516
But she wasn'tjust
in my karate class anymore.

908
00:37:37,624 --> 00:37:40,855
oh, no.
She was in my life.

909
00:37:40,961 --> 00:37:42,588
We were going out
to look for an apartment

910
00:37:42,696 --> 00:37:44,095
for my father tomorrow.

911
00:37:44,197 --> 00:37:47,394
These are things boyfriends
and girlfriends do.

912
00:37:47,501 --> 00:37:50,629
What other things do boyfriends
and girlfriends do?

913
00:37:53,707 --> 00:37:56,039
Someone
need a ride?

914
00:37:56,143 --> 00:37:59,670
So, I'll see you tomorrow: 2:30.

915
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:01,713
Yeah. See you tomorrow.

916
00:38:05,418 --> 00:38:07,511
Are there any
more beautiful words

917
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:11,057
in the English dictionary
than ""See you tomorrow'?

918
00:38:11,158 --> 00:38:13,149
oh, the plan was perfect.

919
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,784
She would tell
her friend, Libby...

920
00:38:14,895 --> 00:38:16,726
to say Rosemary's playing
over at her house.

921
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,559
...from, like, 2:30
until around dinnertime.

922
00:38:18,665 --> 00:38:21,463
See, Libby had a grandmother
who took care ofher...

923
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:22,830
and was literally deaf.

924
00:38:22,936 --> 00:38:25,029
Would never hear the phone
if it rang.

925
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:26,435
So her story was solid.

926
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,405
( on TV):
Let's try ""Anagrammed Birds'' for $200.

927
00:38:28,508 --> 00:38:31,705
I would tell my friend
Max Kavinsky to cover for me.

928
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:33,779
The only possible flaw
in my plan

929
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,246
was that I didn't
actually have the guts

930
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:39,147
to tell Max that
I was hanging out with a girl.

931
00:38:39,252 --> 00:38:42,744
So,you know, I, like, never
actually had the conversation.

932
00:38:42,856 --> 00:38:44,585
Luckily, I knew Max was going

933
00:38:44,691 --> 00:38:46,591
to Six Flags
for the entire day...

934
00:38:46,693 --> 00:38:48,092
I got this.

935
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:49,856
...so I knew he wasn't
going to accidentally call...

936
00:38:49,963 --> 00:38:53,524
looking for me,
or anYThing.

937
00:38:58,305 --> 00:39:00,933
You, um... ride
the subway a lot

938
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:02,565
without any grown-ups?

939
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:06,373
Actually, no. I...

940
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:08,174
I do it all
the time, you know.

941
00:39:08,281 --> 00:39:09,805
It's much more
fun this way.

942
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:11,850
I didn't have the heart
to tell her

943
00:39:11,952 --> 00:39:13,886
I'd never been
south of West 7 2nd.

944
00:39:13,987 --> 00:39:15,852
I felt she needed
my leadership.

945
00:39:19,926 --> 00:39:21,985
Greenwich Village
might as well have been

946
00:39:22,095 --> 00:39:23,289
a thousand miles away.

947
00:39:23,396 --> 00:39:28,766
I think we might have gotten off
a stop or two early.

948
00:39:30,003 --> 00:39:32,403
Do you, um...

949
00:39:32,505 --> 00:39:34,063
Do you want a ride?

950
00:39:34,174 --> 00:39:35,573
You think
we can both fit?

951
00:39:35,675 --> 00:39:37,734
We can try.

952
00:39:37,844 --> 00:39:39,971
Come on. Get on.

953
00:39:53,026 --> 00:39:55,620
With that girl's
arms around me...

954
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:57,959
there was nothing
I couldn't do.

955
00:39:58,064 --> 00:39:59,827
I think it's this way.

956
00:39:59,933 --> 00:40:03,096
With the possible
exception of,uh...

957
00:40:03,203 --> 00:40:05,194
fiinding that apartment
we were looking for.

958
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:15,646
Deja vu.

959
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:19,685
Uh, maybe we should
ask for directions.

960
00:40:19,786 --> 00:40:23,187
No. I think it's just right
up this alley right here.

961
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:26,726
You are so like all
the guys in my family.

962
00:40:35,335 --> 00:40:38,065
- That your girlfriend?
- Excuse me?

963
00:40:38,171 --> 00:40:39,536
She your girl?

964
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:42,199
Yeah. My girlfriend.

965
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:44,470
Huh.

966
00:40:44,577 --> 00:40:47,808
I had a girlfriend
once upon a time, too.

967
00:40:47,914 --> 00:40:49,814
She trampled
my heart.

968
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:51,577
Left me bleeding on the floor.

969
00:40:51,685 --> 00:40:53,016
Run.

970
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,347
What?

971
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:57,252
Run while you
still can, brother.

972
00:40:57,357 --> 00:40:59,917
Take my advice.

973
00:41:00,026 --> 00:41:01,721
Make like the wind.

974
00:41:02,862 --> 00:41:04,193
We were close.

975
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:06,925
one block, a left,
and then another left.

976
00:41:07,033 --> 00:41:08,500
Let's go.

977
00:41:20,847 --> 00:41:22,314
Are you Isaac?

978
00:41:22,415 --> 00:41:25,179
I'm Rosemary.

979
00:41:25,285 --> 00:41:27,253
We're here to
see the apartment.

980
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:29,652
Am I getting Punk'd?

981
00:41:29,756 --> 00:41:31,155
No. It's for my dad.

982
00:41:31,257 --> 00:41:33,191
And will Daddy
be meeting us here?

983
00:41:33,293 --> 00:41:35,124
Well, he will if I give him
the high sign.

984
00:41:35,228 --> 00:41:36,820
Trying to make a
commission or not?

985
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:41,090
ISAAC:
We do a nice

986
00:41:41,201 --> 00:41:43,829
business in two bedrooms
with divorced fathers.

987
00:41:43,937 --> 00:41:45,234
This place
will be gone

988
00:41:45,338 --> 00:41:48,569
in a New York minute,
I promise you.

989
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:50,836
Wood-burning fireplace.

990
00:41:52,312 --> 00:41:54,974
oh, yeah, I noticed.

991
00:41:55,081 --> 00:41:57,208
I didn't know what
we were looking for exactly.

992
00:41:57,317 --> 00:42:00,309
What do you think?

993
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,581
I like it.

994
00:42:02,689 --> 00:42:04,486
It's nice. Amazing.

995
00:42:04,591 --> 00:42:06,354
But I knew one thing
for certain..

996
00:42:06,459 --> 00:42:08,324
Yeah.

997
00:42:08,428 --> 00:42:11,158
It was the most romantic
treetop view I ever saw.

998
00:42:14,534 --> 00:42:14,768
We came home up the bike path
along the Hudson.

999
00:42:14,768 --> 00:42:17,931
We came home up the bike path
along the Hudson.

1000
00:42:18,037 --> 00:42:20,198
67 blocks.

1001
00:42:20,306 --> 00:42:21,967
The most physically
grueling experience

1002
00:42:22,075 --> 00:42:24,635
of my short life
on this planet.

1003
00:42:24,744 --> 00:42:26,644
But I barely felt it.

1004
00:42:26,746 --> 00:42:30,045
I never felt
so ridiculously wonderful.

1005
00:42:32,085 --> 00:42:35,612
This was New York the way
I always want to remember it.

1006
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:37,622
Aplace where
anYThing is possible.

1007
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:39,658
The city of dreams.

1008
00:42:39,759 --> 00:42:41,693
( alternative )

1009
00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:13,418
( song ends )

1010
00:43:13,526 --> 00:43:14,754
What's this?

1011
00:43:14,861 --> 00:43:16,260
oh, this?

1012
00:43:16,362 --> 00:43:17,852
You don't
know about this?

1013
00:43:17,964 --> 00:43:20,398
It's the smallest park
in New York City.

1014
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,697
Some commissioner died and
left his whole townhouse

1015
00:43:23,803 --> 00:43:26,533
to be knocked
down for a park.

1016
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:28,937
How come
I didn't know about this?

1017
00:43:29,042 --> 00:43:30,441
Nobody on your
side of Broadway

1018
00:43:30,543 --> 00:43:31,942
ever comes
over this way.

1019
00:43:32,045 --> 00:43:34,013
That's what's so cool
about West End.

1020
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:47,854
Do you come
here a lot?

1021
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:49,360
Actually, I, um...

1022
00:43:49,462 --> 00:43:52,795
I haven't been here
in quite a while.

1023
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,034
Hey! Mini-Me!

1024
00:44:04,444 --> 00:44:06,002
What are you doing in my park?

1025
00:44:06,112 --> 00:44:07,170
oh, no way.

1026
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,043
Not Darryl Kitzens.
Not now.

1027
00:44:09,148 --> 00:44:10,172
It's a public park.

1028
00:44:10,283 --> 00:44:13,480
What's she doing,
inciting him?

1029
00:44:13,586 --> 00:44:16,487
Doesn't she know that wild
animals need to be placated?

1030
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:18,614
I... I think this
park's big enough

1031
00:44:18,725 --> 00:44:20,488
for all of us, right?

1032
00:44:20,593 --> 00:44:21,958
Who were we kidding?

1033
00:44:22,061 --> 00:44:25,189
A white belt and a yellow belt
facing off

1034
00:44:25,298 --> 00:44:26,925
against the Darth Maul
of PS 87?

1035
00:44:27,033 --> 00:44:29,695
We were gonna get creamed.

1036
00:44:35,808 --> 00:44:38,177
You picked the wrong park,
little man.

1037
00:44:38,177 --> 00:44:38,700
You picked the wrong park,
little man.

1038
00:44:38,811 --> 00:44:40,642
( growls ):
Get the hell
out of my park!

1039
00:44:40,747 --> 00:44:42,112
- Ki-yah!
- ( screams )

1040
00:44:42,215 --> 00:44:43,079
You're dead!

1041
00:44:45,084 --> 00:44:46,051
Ki-yah!

1042
00:44:47,754 --> 00:44:49,016
Ki-yah!

1043
00:44:54,594 --> 00:44:55,788
( groans )

1044
00:44:55,895 --> 00:44:57,362
Come on!
Run, run! Hurry!

1045
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,561
Hop on.

1046
00:45:02,669 --> 00:45:04,261
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go!

1047
00:45:06,506 --> 00:45:08,701
RoSEMARY:
He's coming! He's coming!

1048
00:45:11,077 --> 00:45:13,102
Go faster! Go! Go!

1049
00:45:16,182 --> 00:45:19,276
RoSEMARY:
Make the light! Go on!

1050
00:45:20,853 --> 00:45:24,789
( car tires screeching,
horns honking )

1051
00:45:36,703 --> 00:45:40,434
We were both still flushed
from our day of adventure.

1052
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,235
Well, good night.

1053
00:45:42,342 --> 00:45:43,400
Good night.

1054
00:45:43,509 --> 00:45:45,943
I could do battle
with Darryl Kitzens.

1055
00:45:46,045 --> 00:45:48,570
So why can't
I just lean in to her?

1056
00:45:48,681 --> 00:45:51,081
Do it.
Do it,you wimp, do it.

1057
00:45:53,219 --> 00:45:54,709
That was fun.

1058
00:45:54,821 --> 00:45:56,721
Yeah, it was.

1059
00:45:56,823 --> 00:45:58,916
Scared he's going
to hunt us down?

1060
00:45:59,025 --> 00:46:01,118
I just have to
keep a low profile

1061
00:46:01,227 --> 00:46:02,558
for the rest of the summer.

1062
00:46:02,662 --> 00:46:05,460
And, of course, transfer to
a military school in the fall.

1063
00:46:05,565 --> 00:46:10,730
I just have to keep a low
profile for one more week.

1064
00:46:10,837 --> 00:46:12,566
A week?

1065
00:46:12,672 --> 00:46:14,572
Well, next Sunday,
after the wedding...

1066
00:46:14,674 --> 00:46:15,766
I'm going to camp.

1067
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:17,433
Camp?

1068
00:46:17,543 --> 00:46:19,636
For how long?

1069
00:46:19,746 --> 00:46:21,077
For six weeks.

1070
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,080
Six weeks?

1071
00:46:23,182 --> 00:46:25,480
She might as well
have said she's dying.

1072
00:46:25,585 --> 00:46:27,746
That's fantastic.

1073
00:46:27,854 --> 00:46:30,345
Yeah.

1074
00:46:44,437 --> 00:46:49,272
Well... I better
get inside.

1075
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:51,104
Yeah.

1076
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,609
Good night.

1077
00:46:52,712 --> 00:46:54,270
Good night.

1078
00:47:03,723 --> 00:47:05,350
DooRMAN:
Miss.

1079
00:47:15,034 --> 00:47:17,559
What if she goes to camp
and I never get to kiss her?

1080
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,228
That's the way
it's going to be.

1081
00:47:19,338 --> 00:47:20,737
It's so obvious.

1082
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,331
Every opportunity I have
will go the same way.

1083
00:47:23,443 --> 00:47:25,274
""Good night. '
""Good night. 'No.

1084
00:47:25,378 --> 00:47:26,936
I will not let that happen.

1085
00:47:27,046 --> 00:47:29,537
I will kiss her before
she gets on that bus to Maine.

1086
00:47:29,649 --> 00:47:31,378
I will, I will, I will.!

1087
00:47:42,161 --> 00:47:45,187
Gabe?! Ga...!
That's him!

1088
00:47:45,298 --> 00:47:46,765
There he is.
oh, thank God.

1089
00:47:46,866 --> 00:47:48,993
If they don't kill you,
I'm going to.

1090
00:47:49,102 --> 00:47:51,400
So it, um, it turns out
Max Kavinsky didn't go

1091
00:47:51,504 --> 00:47:52,698
to Six Flags after all.

1092
00:47:52,805 --> 00:47:54,204
He got sick.

1093
00:47:54,307 --> 00:47:55,740
My mother actually ended up

1094
00:47:55,842 --> 00:47:57,969
running into his mother
at the Fairway...

1095
00:47:58,077 --> 00:47:59,772
and, well, they got to talking.

1096
00:47:59,879 --> 00:48:01,972
What?

1097
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:04,379
Gabe, come here!

1098
00:48:04,484 --> 00:48:05,542
Come here.

1099
00:48:06,652 --> 00:48:08,779
Don't you ever
go anywhere again

1100
00:48:08,888 --> 00:48:10,788
without us knowing
where you are...

1101
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:11,982
do you hear me?

1102
00:48:12,091 --> 00:48:14,082
( crying ):
You had us scared half to death.

1103
00:48:14,193 --> 00:48:15,353
GABE:
My punishment..

1104
00:48:15,461 --> 00:48:17,793
no phone, no TV...

1105
00:48:17,897 --> 00:48:19,364
no leaving the apartment
for 48 hours.

1106
00:48:19,465 --> 00:48:21,990
It was the fiirst thing
my parents agreed on

1107
00:48:22,101 --> 00:48:23,193
in a very long time.

1108
00:48:23,302 --> 00:48:24,462
LESLI E:
Do I have to call Rosemary's mother?

1109
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:26,037
- Is that what I have to do?
- No! No!

1110
00:48:26,139 --> 00:48:28,937
- Don't call anyone.
- I thought, I thought
we had an understanding

1111
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:30,508
- on the nine square blocks-
- We do!

1112
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:32,475
that the only way that this
can work, your dad and I...

1113
00:48:32,578 --> 00:48:34,512
I had to throw myself
on the mercy of the court

1114
00:48:34,614 --> 00:48:36,809
just to get special permission
to go to karate class.

1115
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:38,178
I'll do anything!

1116
00:48:38,284 --> 00:48:39,945
I'll wash dishes for
the rest of the summer!

1117
00:48:40,052 --> 00:48:41,314
I promise I will!

1118
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,912
Itjust wasn't an option
to miss that class.

1119
00:48:45,024 --> 00:48:47,390
ADAM:
You scared the hell
out of us today.

1120
00:48:49,262 --> 00:48:50,490
I know, I'm sorry.

1121
00:48:50,596 --> 00:48:51,585
Yeah, what
does sorry mean?

1122
00:48:51,697 --> 00:48:53,392
Sorry means I'm not
gonna do it again.

1123
00:48:53,499 --> 00:48:54,966
- That's right. Never again.
- Right.

1124
00:48:55,067 --> 00:48:56,227
- Right?
- Right.

1125
00:48:57,336 --> 00:48:59,361
Hey, Dad?

1126
00:48:59,472 --> 00:49:00,700
Yeah.

1127
00:49:00,807 --> 00:49:04,299
Are... Are you gonna move out?

1128
00:49:08,214 --> 00:49:10,978
Eventually, yeah, I am, Gabe.

1129
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:13,916
Well, I, um...

1130
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,715
I found an apartment for you.

1131
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:17,050
You what?

1132
00:49:17,156 --> 00:49:18,555
That's where I went today.

1133
00:49:18,658 --> 00:49:21,923
To look for an
apartment for you.

1134
00:49:22,028 --> 00:49:23,461
Do you want me to move out?

1135
00:49:23,563 --> 00:49:26,123
No, no, of course not,
but, you know...

1136
00:49:26,232 --> 00:49:31,329
maybe we can't get our lives
started again until you do.

1137
00:49:32,738 --> 00:49:35,400
Where do you get such big ideas?

1138
00:49:35,508 --> 00:49:38,500
I don't know. I just get them.

1139
00:49:38,611 --> 00:49:40,135
So w-where is
this apartment?

1140
00:49:40,246 --> 00:49:42,373
It's a two-bedroom
on Grove Street.

1141
00:49:42,481 --> 00:49:43,971
In the Village?

1142
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:45,414
Yeah, wood-burning fireplace.

1143
00:49:45,518 --> 00:49:46,416
No way.

1144
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:47,417
Why not?

1145
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,114
It's too far
from you, champ.

1146
00:49:50,223 --> 00:49:53,351
I-I wouldn't move
more than...

1147
00:49:53,459 --> 00:49:56,758
a three- or four-block
radius from you.

1148
00:49:56,863 --> 00:49:59,889
You'd have to go to college
to get farther away from me.

1149
00:50:01,033 --> 00:50:02,022
okay?

1150
00:50:02,134 --> 00:50:03,328
okay.

1151
00:50:03,436 --> 00:50:04,562
Go to sleep.

1152
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:05,637
All right.

1153
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,537
So, uh, what's the deal
with this Rosemary?

1154
00:50:10,643 --> 00:50:12,474
Rosemary?

1155
00:50:12,578 --> 00:50:14,443
How do you mean?

1156
00:50:14,547 --> 00:50:16,913
Nothing.

1157
00:50:17,016 --> 00:50:20,577
I-I, I'm just not used to...

1158
00:50:20,686 --> 00:50:22,813
We do karate
together, Dad.

1159
00:50:22,922 --> 00:50:24,685
Sh-she's my sparring partner.

1160
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:27,350
oh.

1161
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,928
okay, great.

1162
00:50:30,029 --> 00:50:31,053
I didn't even pick her.

1163
00:50:31,163 --> 00:50:33,154
Whatever you say, king.

1164
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:39,930
That night, I had this dream.

1165
00:50:48,681 --> 00:50:49,648
All right! Yeah!

1166
00:50:54,353 --> 00:50:55,251
RoSEMARY:
Gabe...

1167
00:50:55,354 --> 00:50:56,286
Gabe!

1168
00:50:56,389 --> 00:50:58,380
BoY:
I'm open! Gabe!

1169
00:50:58,491 --> 00:51:01,483
( whispering ):
over here...

1170
00:51:01,594 --> 00:51:03,186
BoY:
over to Eric!

1171
00:51:03,296 --> 00:51:04,490
Go, man! Run!

1172
00:51:04,597 --> 00:51:05,894
BoY 2:
Hey!

1173
00:51:05,998 --> 00:51:07,898
RoSEMARY:
Gabe... Gabe...

1174
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,695
( cloth ripping )

1175
00:51:14,407 --> 00:51:15,305
Where are you going?

1176
00:51:15,408 --> 00:51:17,433
You're ditching us for her?

1177
00:51:17,543 --> 00:51:18,567
oh, come on.

1178
00:51:22,848 --> 00:51:24,577
Aw, dude.

1179
00:51:24,684 --> 00:51:25,651
Disgusting.

1180
00:51:32,091 --> 00:51:35,652
The next day, I couldn't
get to class fast enough.

1181
00:51:35,761 --> 00:51:37,422
I was gonna
be near her again...

1182
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:38,861
grapple with her...

1183
00:51:38,965 --> 00:51:40,296
smell her hair.

1184
00:51:40,399 --> 00:51:41,593
Ki-yah!

1185
00:51:41,701 --> 00:51:43,931
That day
the Gates of Hell opened...

1186
00:51:44,036 --> 00:51:45,799
and Tim Staples
walked right through.

1187
00:51:45,905 --> 00:51:47,964
TEACHER:
So, we're gonna shift sparring partners

1188
00:51:48,074 --> 00:51:50,474
to make sure everyone's
with their level.

1189
00:51:50,576 --> 00:51:53,943
That means Tim-
you'll be with Rosemary.

1190
00:51:54,046 --> 00:51:55,274
Could this be?

1191
00:51:55,381 --> 00:51:57,906
My woman getting ripped
from my hands like this?

1192
00:51:58,017 --> 00:51:59,951
I could see where
all this leads.

1193
00:52:00,052 --> 00:52:02,043
Do you, Rosemary Telesco...

1194
00:52:02,154 --> 00:52:04,748
take Tim Staples to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

1195
00:52:04,857 --> 00:52:05,789
( banging )

1196
00:52:05,891 --> 00:52:07,950
No...!

1197
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,152
Rosemary!

1198
00:52:09,261 --> 00:52:12,162
And Gabe, your new
sparring partner

1199
00:52:12,264 --> 00:52:15,290
will be David Betanahu.

1200
00:52:15,401 --> 00:52:16,425
This is my level?

1201
00:52:16,535 --> 00:52:18,730
David Betanahu?

1202
00:52:18,838 --> 00:52:20,305
How could this happen?

1203
00:52:20,406 --> 00:52:21,998
She's with Ashton Kutcher
over there...

1204
00:52:22,108 --> 00:52:25,043
and I'm with the sweatiest
ten-year-old in Manhattan.

1205
00:52:25,144 --> 00:52:26,634
The kid's practically
had a moustache

1206
00:52:26,746 --> 00:52:28,111
since he was in nursery school.

1207
00:52:33,753 --> 00:52:37,382
Everything I took for granted-
stolen in a New York minute.

1208
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:38,252
DAVI D:
Ki-yah!

1209
00:52:38,357 --> 00:52:39,255
Somehow...

1210
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:40,689
Ki-yah!

1211
00:52:40,793 --> 00:52:43,091
...karate wasn't quite the same
without Rosemary.

1212
00:52:45,031 --> 00:52:47,795
So... how was
that class for you?

1213
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,231
Was it a good one?

1214
00:52:49,335 --> 00:52:51,599
Um, I'm having a little trouble

1215
00:52:51,704 --> 00:52:53,262
with this Mochizuki maneuver.

1216
00:52:53,372 --> 00:52:55,067
Yeah, yeah,
me, me too.

1217
00:52:55,174 --> 00:52:56,072
I couldn't resist.

1218
00:52:56,175 --> 00:52:57,608
I needed more and more pain.

1219
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:00,941
So, uh, how's, how's
that Tim guy at the Mochizuki?

1220
00:53:01,047 --> 00:53:03,277
He's a lot
better than me...

1221
00:53:03,382 --> 00:53:05,873
but he wants us to
practice together.

1222
00:53:05,985 --> 00:53:07,816
oh, r-r-really?

1223
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,945
Wow, th-that's terrific.

1224
00:53:10,056 --> 00:53:12,752
You know, hey, when,
when can we get together?

1225
00:53:12,858 --> 00:53:17,295
Well, I've got cello this
afternoon, so, not today.

1226
00:53:17,396 --> 00:53:18,363
Cello?

1227
00:53:18,464 --> 00:53:19,954
But I thought cello
was on Saturdays.

1228
00:53:20,066 --> 00:53:21,624
Tuesday and
Saturday.

1229
00:53:21,734 --> 00:53:23,702
She can't cancel
her frickin'cello lesson?

1230
00:53:23,803 --> 00:53:25,168
Doesn't she know
our days are numbered

1231
00:53:25,271 --> 00:53:26,295
before that bus to camp?

1232
00:53:26,405 --> 00:53:28,305
How 'bout I call you?

1233
00:53:28,407 --> 00:53:30,637
Sure.
Sounds great.

1234
00:53:30,743 --> 00:53:32,836
So that's it?

1235
00:53:32,945 --> 00:53:35,914
just a lousy ""call you'?

1236
00:53:36,015 --> 00:53:37,380
Not even an ""I'll call you. '

1237
00:53:37,483 --> 00:53:39,542
A ""how 'bout I call you'?

1238
00:53:39,652 --> 00:53:41,916
What on earth does that mean?

1239
00:53:42,021 --> 00:53:43,545
When?.!

1240
00:53:43,656 --> 00:53:44,850
( beep )

1241
00:53:44,957 --> 00:53:47,517
You have no new messages.

1242
00:53:50,362 --> 00:53:52,262
What choice did I have,
but to return

1243
00:53:52,364 --> 00:53:54,127
to my old, miserable life?

1244
00:53:54,233 --> 00:53:55,257
Wait a minute.

1245
00:53:55,367 --> 00:53:57,267
You were happy.

1246
00:53:57,369 --> 00:53:58,961
oh, please.!
I was miserable.

1247
00:53:59,071 --> 00:54:00,402
I just didn't know

1248
00:54:00,506 --> 00:54:02,838
how miserable I was.

1249
00:54:02,942 --> 00:54:03,840
Whoa.

1250
00:54:03,943 --> 00:54:04,841
ADAM:
Heads up!

1251
00:54:04,944 --> 00:54:06,138
( shrieks )
Whoa.

1252
00:54:06,245 --> 00:54:07,712
- MAN: Watch it!
- Sorry.

1253
00:54:09,515 --> 00:54:12,609
Where's your head
today, G-man?

1254
00:54:12,718 --> 00:54:14,015
My head?

1255
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,485
Yeah, it's not with the ball.

1256
00:54:15,588 --> 00:54:16,520
What was that?

1257
00:54:16,622 --> 00:54:18,852
It's, it's not my head, Dad.

1258
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:21,290
It's, um... it's my leg.

1259
00:54:21,393 --> 00:54:22,951
I hurt it in karate class.

1260
00:54:23,062 --> 00:54:24,825
Karate.
See, guys like us...

1261
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:26,488
we weren't built
for kicking bricks.

1262
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:28,965
Let's keep our
priorities in line.

1263
00:54:29,068 --> 00:54:30,695
Eyes on the prize.

1264
00:54:33,873 --> 00:54:34,840
Go. Sweet spot.

1265
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,339
- one, two, three...
- He was right.

1266
00:54:36,442 --> 00:54:37,841
My priorities
were all screwed up.

1267
00:54:37,943 --> 00:54:38,875
I was an athlete.

1268
00:54:38,978 --> 00:54:40,309
I just had to shake it off.

1269
00:54:40,412 --> 00:54:41,572
Yeah!

1270
00:54:43,415 --> 00:54:44,473
Look at me.

1271
00:54:44,583 --> 00:54:46,107
I can bounce back.

1272
00:54:46,218 --> 00:54:49,210
I don't need some girl
in my life for me to be happy.

1273
00:54:49,321 --> 00:54:52,415
( phone ringing )

1274
00:54:57,329 --> 00:54:58,694
Hello.

1275
00:54:58,797 --> 00:55:00,355
Yeah.

1276
00:55:00,466 --> 00:55:01,797
You know what?
I really hate it

1277
00:55:01,901 --> 00:55:03,163
when people
call me at home

1278
00:55:03,269 --> 00:55:04,463
and try to sell me stuff.

1279
00:55:06,438 --> 00:55:07,928
That's okay.

1280
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,337
okay. Bye.

1281
00:55:15,381 --> 00:55:19,340
( phone ringing )

1282
00:55:19,451 --> 00:55:21,942
Hello.

1283
00:55:22,054 --> 00:55:24,284
Hi.

1284
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:25,550
Yeah, he's right here.

1285
00:55:25,658 --> 00:55:26,625
Gabe.

1286
00:55:28,494 --> 00:55:29,461
It's a girl.

1287
00:55:37,403 --> 00:55:38,301
I got it!

1288
00:55:38,404 --> 00:55:39,496
ADAM ( on phone ):
Got it?

1289
00:55:39,605 --> 00:55:40,572
I got it!

1290
00:55:43,342 --> 00:55:44,434
Hey.

1291
00:55:44,543 --> 00:55:45,908
RoSEMARY:
I said I was gonna call.

1292
00:55:46,011 --> 00:55:47,444
Did you?

1293
00:55:47,546 --> 00:55:49,207
I don't even remember.

1294
00:55:49,315 --> 00:55:51,283
Smooth under pressure.

1295
00:55:51,383 --> 00:55:52,748
- ( heart beating )
- That's me.

1296
00:55:52,851 --> 00:55:55,217
If only I could do something
about the beating of my heart.

1297
00:55:55,321 --> 00:55:56,345
( heart beating )

1298
00:55:56,455 --> 00:55:58,013
Could she hear that
through the phone?

1299
00:55:58,123 --> 00:55:59,818
So what are you
doing tomorrow night?

1300
00:55:59,925 --> 00:56:01,950
Um, tomorrow night?

1301
00:56:02,061 --> 00:56:06,088
Yeah, it's summer, so it's not
like a school night or anything.

1302
00:56:06,198 --> 00:56:07,893
Uh, I-I'm free, totally.

1303
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,831
'Cause my parents
got these special tickets

1304
00:56:09,935 --> 00:56:12,631
to this concert with this guy
who's supposed to be, like...

1305
00:56:12,738 --> 00:56:14,603
the greatest singer
in New York or something.

1306
00:56:14,707 --> 00:56:17,938
Do you, um, want to go?

1307
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:20,807
Uh, me, me, me and your parents?

1308
00:56:20,913 --> 00:56:22,380
And me, too.

1309
00:56:22,481 --> 00:56:24,813
My mom said I could
invite anyone I want.

1310
00:56:24,917 --> 00:56:26,111
Sounds awesome.

1311
00:56:26,218 --> 00:56:27,116
Great.

1312
00:56:27,219 --> 00:56:28,311
She called.

1313
00:56:28,454 --> 00:56:30,581
She said she was gonna call
and she kept her word.

1314
00:56:30,689 --> 00:56:31,815
This was notjust some fiigment

1315
00:56:31,924 --> 00:56:33,152
of my imagination.

1316
00:56:33,259 --> 00:56:36,194
our love is a two-way street.

1317
00:56:40,065 --> 00:56:42,556
Hey.

1318
00:56:42,668 --> 00:56:44,226
You're looking
sharp there, tiger.

1319
00:56:44,336 --> 00:56:46,065
Like I even care.

1320
00:56:46,171 --> 00:56:48,162
Nice.

1321
00:56:48,274 --> 00:56:49,798
I especially
like the hair.

1322
00:56:53,312 --> 00:56:54,609
Come on, mess it up.

1323
00:56:56,749 --> 00:56:59,115
Don't take all your romantic
advice from him, Gabe.

1324
00:56:59,218 --> 00:57:02,619
You look very nice.

1325
00:57:02,721 --> 00:57:04,518
I, um, I'm gonna
wait downstairs.

1326
00:57:04,623 --> 00:57:07,183
Do you want us to come down
and say hi to her parents?

1327
00:57:07,293 --> 00:57:09,420
No.

1328
00:57:09,528 --> 00:57:10,927
Excuse me.

1329
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:12,998
They said they'd have you
home by 1 1 :00...

1330
00:57:13,098 --> 00:57:16,431
and if you're gonna be one
second later, I'll need a call.

1331
00:57:16,535 --> 00:57:20,096
okay.

1332
00:57:20,205 --> 00:57:22,435
our little boy
is growing up, huh?

1333
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:24,133
Yeah, he is.

1334
00:57:32,117 --> 00:57:33,641
Pretty snazzy.

1335
00:57:33,752 --> 00:57:34,946
Big night?

1336
00:57:35,054 --> 00:57:37,386
Just some date
with some girl-

1337
00:57:37,489 --> 00:57:40,117
you know, nothing,
nothing big.

1338
00:57:40,225 --> 00:57:42,386
That girl that came by here
the other day?

1339
00:57:42,494 --> 00:57:45,019
That'd be the one.

1340
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:48,122
She was a nice girl,
that girl that came by here.

1341
00:57:48,233 --> 00:57:51,100
All right, Mr. Gabe.

1342
00:57:54,173 --> 00:57:55,697
Hey, Gabe.

1343
00:57:55,808 --> 00:57:56,797
Nice to see you.

1344
00:57:56,909 --> 00:57:57,807
You, too.

1345
00:57:57,910 --> 00:57:59,673
Thanks for joining us.

1346
00:57:59,778 --> 00:58:00,676
Hi, Mrs. Telesco.

1347
00:58:00,779 --> 00:58:02,974
MRS. TELESCo:
Hello. How are you?

1348
00:58:03,082 --> 00:58:05,277
Good.

1349
00:58:12,324 --> 00:58:13,848
Welcome to The Carlyle.

1350
00:58:16,762 --> 00:58:17,729
Ma'am.

1351
00:58:23,635 --> 00:58:27,002
Yeah, Mickey took me
here on our third date.

1352
00:58:27,106 --> 00:58:29,074
We had to stand right
over there by the bar

1353
00:58:29,174 --> 00:58:30,334
because we couldn't
afford a table.

1354
00:58:30,442 --> 00:58:31,875
And from that
moment on...

1355
00:58:31,977 --> 00:58:34,275
there was
no turning back for us.

1356
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,848
( applause )

1357
00:58:36,949 --> 00:58:38,143
You're gonna love this guy.

1358
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:40,115
No one sings
like Loston Harris.

1359
00:58:40,219 --> 00:58:41,914
This guy is New York.

1360
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:46,150
( slowjazz intro playing )

1361
00:58:47,993 --> 00:58:53,021
( jazz standard )

1362
00:58:55,267 --> 00:58:57,701
I can't tell you what
that fiirst song was about.

1363
00:58:57,803 --> 00:59:00,772
Something about love
and a boy and a girl...

1364
00:59:00,873 --> 00:59:02,738
and this boy
can think of nothing

1365
00:59:02,841 --> 00:59:05,036
but holding that
girl's hand in the darkness.

1366
00:59:05,144 --> 00:59:07,578
( continues )

1367
00:59:13,318 --> 00:59:15,650
I'm not sure how
I got the courage.

1368
00:59:15,754 --> 00:59:18,245
Maybe it was the buzz
from the Shirley Temple.

1369
00:59:18,357 --> 00:59:20,416
Maybe it was Loston Harris-

1370
00:59:20,526 --> 00:59:22,426
the greatest singer this
little town has ever known.

1371
00:59:22,528 --> 00:59:26,897
But I knew our relationship
had to get to the next step...

1372
00:59:26,999 --> 00:59:31,459
or Rosemary and I wouldjust
remain karate friends forever.

1373
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:33,333
( continues )

1374
00:59:50,756 --> 00:59:52,519
Never had I been
so keenly aware

1375
00:59:52,624 --> 00:59:56,958
of the ability of my palm
to manufacture sweat.

1376
00:59:57,062 --> 00:59:59,053
But I was determined to hold
that girl's hand

1377
00:59:59,164 --> 01:00:01,132
for every single second.

1378
01:00:04,069 --> 01:00:06,128
What does this mean?
Does she hate me?

1379
01:00:06,238 --> 01:00:08,035
Is she grossed out by me?

1380
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:10,040
Am I pushing everything
way too fast?

1381
01:00:18,417 --> 01:00:21,284
All those ridiculous
songs about love-

1382
01:00:21,386 --> 01:00:22,785
I fiinally understood.

1383
01:00:22,888 --> 01:00:23,889
( song ends, applause )

1384
01:00:23,889 --> 01:00:25,948
( song ends, applause )

1385
01:00:26,058 --> 01:00:28,253
Forget the second stop.

1386
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,521
We're gonna walk
from here, too.

1387
01:00:30,629 --> 01:00:31,926
Thanks.

1388
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:34,964
Thanks.

1389
01:00:37,135 --> 01:00:39,899
Well, uh, you guys
say your good nights now...

1390
01:00:40,005 --> 01:00:42,098
and, uh, Daddy and I
are gonna get some milk

1391
01:00:42,207 --> 01:00:44,971
for breakfast tomorrow, okay?
So...

1392
01:00:45,077 --> 01:00:47,204
Good night, Mrs. Telesco.

1393
01:00:47,312 --> 01:00:49,212
oh, thank you
for coming, Gabe.

1394
01:00:49,314 --> 01:00:50,576
oh, thank you.

1395
01:00:53,886 --> 01:00:55,319
Your parents
are cool.

1396
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:58,048
Everyone says I'm gonna
hate them in a few years.

1397
01:00:58,156 --> 01:01:00,420
Think you will?

1398
01:01:00,526 --> 01:01:01,550
Probably.

1399
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:05,096
If people say so.

1400
01:01:05,197 --> 01:01:06,755
This is the time.

1401
01:01:06,865 --> 01:01:08,958
I know it. She knows it.

1402
01:01:09,067 --> 01:01:11,228
My God,
even her parents know it.

1403
01:01:11,336 --> 01:01:12,633
Why can't I kiss her?

1404
01:01:12,738 --> 01:01:13,898
What's stopping me?

1405
01:01:14,006 --> 01:01:15,633
Is it cooties I fear?

1406
01:01:15,741 --> 01:01:18,642
So... big wedding
this weekend.

1407
01:01:18,744 --> 01:01:20,177
Yeah, right.

1408
01:01:20,279 --> 01:01:22,144
I forgot about that.

1409
01:01:22,247 --> 01:01:25,410
I wish you could come.

1410
01:01:25,517 --> 01:01:28,611
It's gonna be
really boring.

1411
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,551
Yeah, I really
wanna see you

1412
01:01:30,656 --> 01:01:33,523
do your flower
girl thing.

1413
01:01:33,625 --> 01:01:35,957
Part of me is sure
I'm gonna tr...

1414
01:01:41,934 --> 01:01:43,993
Did... did I do it right?

1415
01:01:46,038 --> 01:01:47,596
I don't know.

1416
01:01:47,706 --> 01:01:50,106
I have absolutely
nothing to compare it to.

1417
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:51,800
My God, was I even close?

1418
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:52,968
I...

1419
01:01:53,078 --> 01:01:55,376
I should go.

1420
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,471
Yeah.

1421
01:01:59,484 --> 01:02:00,712
Good night.

1422
01:02:00,819 --> 01:02:03,185
Good night.

1423
01:02:12,397 --> 01:02:14,490
Hey, how was your night,
little Romeo?

1424
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,794
It was good.

1425
01:02:15,901 --> 01:02:17,334
It was great.

1426
01:02:17,436 --> 01:02:20,633
Fine, I think.

1427
01:02:20,739 --> 01:02:23,674
But I had no idea.

1428
01:02:23,775 --> 01:02:28,337
I kept playing the moment over
and over and over in my head.

1429
01:02:28,447 --> 01:02:33,146
Was it too fast?
Too hard? Too gross?

1430
01:02:33,251 --> 01:02:35,310
Did she actually
want me to kiss her?

1431
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:36,011
I gotta go.

1432
01:02:36,121 --> 01:02:36,951
I gotta go.

1433
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:37,783
I gotta go.

1434
01:02:37,889 --> 01:02:39,754
or did I scare her away?

1435
01:02:39,858 --> 01:02:41,883
oh, I had it bad,
this new feeling...

1436
01:02:41,994 --> 01:02:43,621
deep in the pit of my stomach.

1437
01:02:43,729 --> 01:02:45,629
This horrible love sickness.

1438
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,194
( retching, vomiting )

1439
01:02:49,301 --> 01:02:51,769
Maybe this is what cooties are.

1440
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:54,065
By the next day, I was a wreck.

1441
01:02:54,172 --> 01:02:56,231
I purposely didn't call her-

1442
01:02:56,341 --> 01:02:58,138
okay, except for one hang-up-

1443
01:02:58,243 --> 01:03:00,370
because I knew
I would see her in karate.

1444
01:03:00,479 --> 01:03:03,642
I got to class
ten minutes early.

1445
01:03:07,285 --> 01:03:08,946
Hey.

1446
01:03:09,054 --> 01:03:11,113
Hey.

1447
01:03:11,223 --> 01:03:16,923
okay, I knew what I was doing
here early, but what was he?

1448
01:03:17,029 --> 01:03:20,795
one thing was clear-
this business

1449
01:03:20,899 --> 01:03:23,561
had to be settled
right here and right now.

1450
01:03:23,669 --> 01:03:25,159
Staples.

1451
01:03:46,825 --> 01:03:47,917
Ki-yah!

1452
01:03:50,128 --> 01:03:51,095
Ki-yah!

1453
01:03:53,432 --> 01:03:55,457
( grunting )

1454
01:04:03,842 --> 01:04:05,173
Ki-yah!

1455
01:04:05,277 --> 01:04:07,438
( mirror shattering )

1456
01:04:11,249 --> 01:04:13,217
If only life was so simple.

1457
01:04:13,318 --> 01:04:14,478
( sighs )

1458
01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:17,621
3..09.
She's not even coming.

1459
01:04:17,723 --> 01:04:18,690
TEACHER:
Hai.!

1460
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:20,781
She doesn't
even want to see me.

1461
01:04:20,892 --> 01:04:22,450
She's blowing off class.

1462
01:04:22,561 --> 01:04:23,789
She hates me.

1463
01:04:23,895 --> 01:04:25,795
Your fists should
be like a hammer.

1464
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,400
She came.
She's here. She loves me.

1465
01:04:31,503 --> 01:04:33,801
Sorry I'm late.

1466
01:04:33,905 --> 01:04:36,169
TEACHER:
Miss Telesco, nice
of you to join us.

1467
01:04:39,911 --> 01:04:41,378
Wait a minute.

1468
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,845
What was that?

1469
01:04:42,948 --> 01:04:46,281
Was that a smile,
or is she, like, mad at me?

1470
01:04:46,384 --> 01:04:49,820
Why would she be mad at me?
I only kissed her.

1471
01:04:49,921 --> 01:04:52,151
Why the heck did I kiss her?

1472
01:04:52,257 --> 01:04:54,725
What was I possibly thinking?

1473
01:04:54,826 --> 01:04:55,815
Ki-yah!

1474
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:00,064
There are very few things
more painful

1475
01:05:00,165 --> 01:05:03,999
than watching the woman you
love grapple with another man.

1476
01:05:04,102 --> 01:05:06,093
Actually, I take that back.

1477
01:05:06,204 --> 01:05:08,672
There are
no things more painful.

1478
01:05:08,774 --> 01:05:10,674
The answer lies
within you, Gabriel...

1479
01:05:10,776 --> 01:05:11,970
and you alone.

1480
01:05:12,077 --> 01:05:13,635
You must find
your strength.

1481
01:05:13,745 --> 01:05:16,908
Your focus.
Your determination.

1482
01:05:17,015 --> 01:05:18,414
Ki-yah!

1483
01:05:18,517 --> 01:05:19,609
Ki-yah!

1484
01:05:19,718 --> 01:05:21,686
Ki-yah! Ki-yah! Ki-yah!

1485
01:05:21,787 --> 01:05:23,755
Poor David Betanahu.

1486
01:05:23,855 --> 01:05:26,016
He was an innocent victim
in all this.

1487
01:05:26,124 --> 01:05:27,785
Collateral damage
in this love affair.

1488
01:05:27,893 --> 01:05:31,989
one, two, three, four...

1489
01:05:32,097 --> 01:05:34,031
I couldn't
take my eyes offher.

1490
01:05:34,132 --> 01:05:35,497
- High block...
- She loves me.

1491
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,532
...middle punch,
Ki-yah!

1492
01:05:36,635 --> 01:05:39,103
She loves me not.

1493
01:05:39,204 --> 01:05:41,638
She loves me.

1494
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,105
Loves me not.

1495
01:05:43,208 --> 01:05:45,870
She loves me. Not. Not.

1496
01:05:45,977 --> 01:05:47,604
Loves. Not.

1497
01:05:47,712 --> 01:05:52,172
By 3..5 1, I had descended
fully into madness.

1498
01:05:52,284 --> 01:05:54,047
Who wants to take
their yellow belt exam?

1499
01:05:54,152 --> 01:05:54,948
Me!

1500
01:05:55,053 --> 01:05:56,645
( classmates gasping )

1501
01:05:56,755 --> 01:05:58,120
Ah, Gabe.

1502
01:05:58,223 --> 01:06:00,316
The moment
of reckoning is upon us.

1503
01:06:00,425 --> 01:06:02,655
okay, maybe I was
a little overeager...

1504
01:06:02,761 --> 01:06:04,661
but it was
my only way back to her.

1505
01:06:04,763 --> 01:06:07,960
Luckily, I had the great master
of masters in my corner.

1506
01:06:08,066 --> 01:06:09,226
Ki-yah!

1507
01:06:09,334 --> 01:06:11,564
Ah, very nice. Very nice.

1508
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:13,160
Let's see your Mochizuki now.

1509
01:06:13,271 --> 01:06:14,135
Hit, switch.

1510
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:16,070
Hit! Hit!
Sweep.

1511
01:06:18,677 --> 01:06:19,871
oh...

1512
01:06:19,978 --> 01:06:23,414
very nice, very nice.

1513
01:06:23,515 --> 01:06:25,176
You've come a long way.

1514
01:06:25,283 --> 01:06:28,480
Excellent Gabriel. Excellent.

1515
01:06:28,587 --> 01:06:31,852
Now, time for the break.

1516
01:06:31,957 --> 01:06:34,858
All that stood between me
and the woman I loved

1517
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,054
was a half-inch
piece of plywood.

1518
01:06:38,163 --> 01:06:40,256
Be the board,
Gabe.

1519
01:06:40,365 --> 01:06:41,889
Be the board.

1520
01:06:44,035 --> 01:06:46,936
At that moment,
I was the board.

1521
01:06:48,773 --> 01:06:50,070
Ki-yah!

1522
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:54,608
( groaning )

1523
01:06:54,713 --> 01:06:57,409
( gasping, groaning )

1524
01:06:57,515 --> 01:06:59,039
ow! ow!

1525
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:01,812
ow! oh! Aah...!

1526
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,378
( whimpering,
howling )

1527
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:06,855
The pain! The pain!

1528
01:07:06,958 --> 01:07:08,186
oh, my God!

1529
01:07:08,293 --> 01:07:10,284
ow!

1530
01:07:10,395 --> 01:07:13,626
oh, ow... Aw...

1531
01:07:13,732 --> 01:07:15,632
( groaning )

1532
01:07:15,734 --> 01:07:18,396
( howling ):
ow...!

1533
01:07:18,503 --> 01:07:21,131
I don't remember
much after that.

1534
01:07:21,239 --> 01:07:22,206
Gabe...

1535
01:07:22,307 --> 01:07:24,298
They, um, they said
I blacked out.

1536
01:07:24,409 --> 01:07:25,343
( machine whirring quietly )

1537
01:07:25,343 --> 01:07:26,810
( machine whirring quietly )

1538
01:07:38,223 --> 01:07:39,781
( mouthing word )

1539
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,893
I guess this
is the end of karate, huh?

1540
01:07:45,997 --> 01:07:48,727
( sighs ):
I'm a placekicker.

1541
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:51,028
If you work hard,
you can achieve anything.

1542
01:07:51,136 --> 01:07:52,694
I really believe
that, Gabe.

1543
01:07:52,804 --> 01:07:54,362
Whatever.

1544
01:07:56,274 --> 01:07:57,298
- Hey.
- Hey.

1545
01:07:57,409 --> 01:07:59,309
I came as soon
as I got the message.

1546
01:07:59,411 --> 01:08:00,901
What happened?

1547
01:08:01,012 --> 01:08:04,675
He went a little too hard
for his yellow belt.

1548
01:08:04,783 --> 01:08:06,250
Mm.

1549
01:08:06,351 --> 01:08:07,409
Sounds like
we're gonna need

1550
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:08,986
some ice cream on
the way home, huh?

1551
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:11,920
No, thanks.

1552
01:08:14,259 --> 01:08:16,250
Was this it?

1553
01:08:16,361 --> 01:08:18,761
Was this the end
for me and Rosemary?

1554
01:08:18,863 --> 01:08:21,161
Two and a half weeks
was all the time

1555
01:08:21,266 --> 01:08:22,756
we were going to be allowed?

1556
01:08:22,867 --> 01:08:24,357
I was not gonna call her.

1557
01:08:24,469 --> 01:08:26,198
That would be weak.

1558
01:08:26,304 --> 01:08:28,829
And I resolved that night
to be weak no longer.

1559
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:31,033
- ( phone rings )
- Hello?

1560
01:08:31,142 --> 01:08:33,474
Hello, Mrs. Burton?

1561
01:08:33,578 --> 01:08:35,136
No, this is Gabe.

1562
01:08:35,246 --> 01:08:38,113
Who cares if she thought
I was my mother? It was her.!

1563
01:08:38,216 --> 01:08:40,116
Hello?

1564
01:08:40,218 --> 01:08:41,378
No, Mom, I got it.

1565
01:08:41,486 --> 01:08:42,418
Who is it?

1566
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,112
Mom, I got it.
Hang up now.

1567
01:08:44,222 --> 01:08:45,154
okay, hon.

1568
01:08:45,256 --> 01:08:46,655
Hey.

1569
01:08:46,758 --> 01:08:49,625
Hey, how's your hand?

1570
01:08:49,728 --> 01:08:50,695
My hand?

1571
01:08:50,795 --> 01:08:52,228
oh, it's fine. Barely hurt.

1572
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:55,231
I just got so worried
when you lost consciousness.

1573
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:58,496
Yeah, that was only,
like, for a second or so.

1574
01:08:58,603 --> 01:09:00,230
What color cast did you get?

1575
01:09:00,338 --> 01:09:02,499
Plain was the best
of my choices.

1576
01:09:02,607 --> 01:09:05,201
My cousin got this Hulk one.

1577
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:08,507
Yeah, they had that, too, but
I'm not really into the Hulk.

1578
01:09:08,613 --> 01:09:10,376
This was
no time for small talk.

1579
01:09:10,482 --> 01:09:12,382
It was time
to lay things on the table.

1580
01:09:12,484 --> 01:09:13,917
To reach
through that phone line

1581
01:09:14,019 --> 01:09:15,816
and dig deep
into that woman's soul.

1582
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,821
So when can we hang out?

1583
01:09:18,923 --> 01:09:22,256
It's a really
crazy weekend for me.

1584
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,520
It is?

1585
01:09:23,628 --> 01:09:24,788
It's Thursday night.

1586
01:09:24,896 --> 01:09:26,420
She's going to camp
Sunday morning.

1587
01:09:26,531 --> 01:09:28,294
Who cares how crazy
the weekend is?

1588
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,492
Rehearsal dinner tomorrow night...

1589
01:09:29,601 --> 01:09:32,764
wedding on Saturday,
camp on Sunday.

1590
01:09:32,871 --> 01:09:34,839
Sure, right. of course.

1591
01:09:34,939 --> 01:09:37,430
Where's her whole ""Wish you
could come to the wedding'?

1592
01:09:37,542 --> 01:09:39,806
Where's that Rosemary?
The Rosemary I loved.

1593
01:09:39,911 --> 01:09:42,345
Not this alien
with her crazy weekends.

1594
01:09:42,447 --> 01:09:44,881
Your new sparring partner,
is he coming to the wedding?

1595
01:09:44,983 --> 01:09:46,848
What? Tim?

1596
01:09:46,951 --> 01:09:48,043
oh, is that what you call him?

1597
01:09:48,153 --> 01:09:50,121
Are you calling him
after you call me?

1598
01:09:50,221 --> 01:09:51,813
What are you talking about?

1599
01:09:51,923 --> 01:09:54,551
I'm talking about you and
Tim Staples sitting in a tree.

1600
01:09:54,659 --> 01:09:56,627
K-I-S-S-I-N-G

1601
01:09:56,728 --> 01:09:57,990
First comes love

1602
01:09:58,096 --> 01:09:59,256
Then comes marriage

1603
01:09:59,364 --> 01:10:01,559
Then comes Tim Staples
in a baby carriage.

1604
01:10:01,666 --> 01:10:03,190
You sound crazy, you know that?

1605
01:10:03,301 --> 01:10:05,064
Why don't you
have time this weekend?

1606
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:08,401
I'm sorry, Gabe.
I haven't even started packing.

1607
01:10:08,506 --> 01:10:09,768
You know what? I hate you.

1608
01:10:09,874 --> 01:10:11,432
What?!

1609
01:10:11,543 --> 01:10:13,443
I hate you.
Why do you even care?

1610
01:10:13,545 --> 01:10:14,477
I hate you.

1611
01:10:14,579 --> 01:10:16,046
Well, I hate you, too.

1612
01:10:16,147 --> 01:10:17,273
I hate you more.

1613
01:10:17,382 --> 01:10:19,873
How can you
say something so mean?

1614
01:10:19,984 --> 01:10:21,474
I hate you!

1615
01:10:21,586 --> 01:10:22,746
( slams receiver )

1616
01:10:24,856 --> 01:10:26,187
( receiver slams )

1617
01:10:31,362 --> 01:10:33,091
( crying )

1618
01:10:37,802 --> 01:10:39,292
Rosemary!

1619
01:10:48,079 --> 01:10:49,944
Rosemary!

1620
01:11:00,225 --> 01:11:02,625
You want to or should I?

1621
01:11:07,132 --> 01:11:10,124
Rosemary!

1622
01:11:10,235 --> 01:11:12,362
It was the pain
that had no name.

1623
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:15,234
oh! ooh! ow! ow! ow!

1624
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:20,875
Why did Rosemary Telesco
ever have to walk into my life?

1625
01:11:20,979 --> 01:11:23,311
Why, why, why?

1626
01:11:28,219 --> 01:11:33,486
Maybe not everything
is supposed to last forever.

1627
01:11:33,591 --> 01:11:39,154
Certain things are like...
like... skywriting.

1628
01:11:39,264 --> 01:11:41,664
Like, like, like
a really beautiful thing

1629
01:11:41,766 --> 01:11:44,530
that lasts for
a couple moments and then...

1630
01:11:44,636 --> 01:11:45,568
You know?

1631
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:47,194
( crying )

1632
01:11:54,245 --> 01:11:55,337
Mommy!

1633
01:11:55,446 --> 01:11:57,676
I know, honey.

1634
01:11:57,782 --> 01:11:59,841
Love sucks.

1635
01:11:59,951 --> 01:12:01,009
Yeah.

1636
01:12:08,726 --> 01:12:09,818
Look at them all.

1637
01:12:09,928 --> 01:12:12,089
Rats in their cages...

1638
01:12:12,197 --> 01:12:14,893
their lives destroyed by love.

1639
01:12:14,999 --> 01:12:16,023
I'm done with it.

1640
01:12:18,102 --> 01:12:20,297
I won't be like them.

1641
01:12:20,405 --> 01:12:21,838
( grunts )

1642
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:23,601
The fools.

1643
01:12:27,212 --> 01:12:29,077
I remember
my first girl.

1644
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:30,169
We met on
theJersey shore.

1645
01:12:30,281 --> 01:12:31,270
She was from Philly...

1646
01:12:31,382 --> 01:12:32,542
I was from Brooklyn...

1647
01:12:32,650 --> 01:12:35,141
so, we knew right from
the start, we were cursed.

1648
01:12:35,253 --> 01:12:37,187
Ralph, not right now.
I'm not in the mood.

1649
01:12:37,288 --> 01:12:38,915
okay.

1650
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:45,987
oh, hejsan.
God morgon.

1651
01:12:46,097 --> 01:12:47,223
Hejsan.

1652
01:13:10,555 --> 01:13:16,016
( alternative )

1653
01:13:33,077 --> 01:13:38,447
( continues )

1654
01:13:47,625 --> 01:13:50,253
It's amazing how quickly
time moves.

1655
01:13:50,361 --> 01:13:53,387
just yesterday,
I thought I loved her.

1656
01:13:53,498 --> 01:13:56,729
But now I don't even
care about her at all.

1657
01:13:56,834 --> 01:14:00,463
( continues )

1658
01:14:11,582 --> 01:14:14,346
( song ends )

1659
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:21,158
The next morning, this kind
of amazing thing happened.

1660
01:14:21,259 --> 01:14:23,921
The sun came out again.

1661
01:14:24,028 --> 01:14:27,020
See, life is about so much more
than Rosemary.

1662
01:14:27,131 --> 01:14:32,569
I have my family, my health,
my kicking career.

1663
01:14:32,670 --> 01:14:35,935
I really had no room
for a woman in my life.

1664
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:39,066
How about some rocky road?

1665
01:14:39,177 --> 01:14:41,441
I guess.

1666
01:14:45,183 --> 01:14:46,343
Dad?

1667
01:14:46,451 --> 01:14:47,884
Yeah.

1668
01:14:47,985 --> 01:14:50,180
What's the deal
with girls?

1669
01:14:50,288 --> 01:14:52,381
I mean, why are they
the way they are?

1670
01:14:56,327 --> 01:14:58,488
You're talking
to the wrong man.

1671
01:14:59,564 --> 01:15:03,398
Well, how come all love
has to end?

1672
01:15:13,177 --> 01:15:19,082
Let me... let me tell you
something about me and your mom.

1673
01:15:19,183 --> 01:15:23,711
once upon a time,
we really loved each other.

1674
01:15:23,821 --> 01:15:27,348
But as... as time went by...

1675
01:15:27,458 --> 01:15:30,552
there just got to be
all these... these things-

1676
01:15:30,661 --> 01:15:32,026
little things...

1677
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:35,566
stupid things that
were left unsaid.

1678
01:15:35,666 --> 01:15:37,793
And all these things
that were left unsaid

1679
01:15:37,902 --> 01:15:42,362
piled up like... like
the clutter in our storage room.

1680
01:15:42,473 --> 01:15:44,373
And after awhile...

1681
01:15:44,475 --> 01:15:46,340
there was so much
that was left unsaid...

1682
01:15:46,444 --> 01:15:50,141
that we barely said anything
at all.

1683
01:15:50,248 --> 01:15:54,150
Well... why didn't you
just say 'em then, Dad?

1684
01:15:57,021 --> 01:16:00,149
I don't know, Gabe.

1685
01:16:00,258 --> 01:16:02,283
I kinda wish I had.

1686
01:16:04,061 --> 01:16:05,494
Who was I kidding, anyway?

1687
01:16:05,596 --> 01:16:07,689
I wasn't going to get
any real comfort here.

1688
01:16:07,799 --> 01:16:10,597
I mean, the old guy
meant okay.

1689
01:16:10,701 --> 01:16:12,965
Let's knock over a hot dog stand
on the way home.

1690
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:16,403
Drown our sorrows in pork
shoulders and nitrates.

1691
01:16:16,507 --> 01:16:17,997
Nah, I think it's all right.

1692
01:16:18,109 --> 01:16:21,010
I'm just going to, I don't know,
hang out here for awhile.

1693
01:16:21,112 --> 01:16:23,580
okay, champ.

1694
01:16:23,681 --> 01:16:25,012
See you
at the homestead.

1695
01:16:25,116 --> 01:16:26,014
All right.

1696
01:16:26,117 --> 01:16:27,516
You kicked good today.

1697
01:16:27,618 --> 01:16:30,052
I'm telling you,
the trajectory you're on-

1698
01:16:30,154 --> 01:16:31,553
to the moon.

1699
01:16:31,656 --> 01:16:32,816
or at least the Big Ten.

1700
01:16:32,924 --> 01:16:34,414
Thanks.

1701
01:16:34,525 --> 01:16:36,049
Felt good.

1702
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,720
Good. I'll see
you at home.

1703
01:16:43,301 --> 01:16:45,496
Somewhere,
a million miles away...

1704
01:16:45,603 --> 01:16:51,701
the girl I once loved
was going down her road...

1705
01:16:51,809 --> 01:16:53,743
and I was stuck back on mine.

1706
01:17:40,358 --> 01:17:41,950
I couldn't escape them-

1707
01:17:42,059 --> 01:17:45,051
all the little things
I left unsaid.

1708
01:17:45,162 --> 01:17:47,858
I was drowning in them.

1709
01:18:01,646 --> 01:18:04,206
Suddenly,
I knew what I had to do.

1710
01:18:06,284 --> 01:18:08,650
Love isn't about ridiculous
little words.

1711
01:18:08,753 --> 01:18:10,084
Love is about grand gestures.

1712
01:18:10,187 --> 01:18:13,213
Don't go to Taos,
not without me.

1713
01:18:13,324 --> 01:18:17,192
Love is about airplanes
pulling banners over stadiums.

1714
01:18:17,295 --> 01:18:19,559
Proposals on Jumbotrons.

1715
01:18:19,664 --> 01:18:22,792
Giant words in skywriting.

1716
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:26,563
Love is about going that
extra mile, even if it hurts.

1717
01:18:26,671 --> 01:18:31,040
Letting it all hang out there.

1718
01:18:31,142 --> 01:18:32,609
Love is about fiinding courage
inside of you

1719
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:35,611
that you didn't even know
was there.

1720
01:18:59,804 --> 01:19:06,232
( jazz standard )

1721
01:19:28,599 --> 01:19:30,692
( continues )

1722
01:19:30,801 --> 01:19:31,768
Whew.

1723
01:20:03,868 --> 01:20:07,599
( song fades )

1724
01:20:07,705 --> 01:20:09,832
What are you
doing here?

1725
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:11,532
You're going to
camp tomorrow.

1726
01:20:11,642 --> 01:20:13,507
I had to say good-bye.

1727
01:20:13,611 --> 01:20:16,637
But I thought you hate me.

1728
01:20:16,747 --> 01:20:18,942
I don't.

1729
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:20,642
I lied.

1730
01:20:20,751 --> 01:20:22,685
I wasn't going
to be like my father.

1731
01:20:22,787 --> 01:20:27,747
I wasn't going to let all these
things left unsaid smother me.

1732
01:20:27,858 --> 01:20:29,450
Rosemary...

1733
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:35,661
I love you.

1734
01:20:35,766 --> 01:20:37,927
You what?

1735
01:20:38,035 --> 01:20:39,434
I do.

1736
01:20:39,537 --> 01:20:41,232
I'm sorry...

1737
01:20:41,338 --> 01:20:43,932
but I love you more than anyone
has ever loved.

1738
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:46,009
I love you, I love you,
I love you.

1739
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:48,271
How's that for letting it
all hang out there...

1740
01:20:48,379 --> 01:20:56,047
and hang and hang and hang?

1741
01:20:56,153 --> 01:20:59,281
Do you, um...

1742
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:02,086
you think you might
want to love me, too?

1743
01:21:02,193 --> 01:21:04,855
I don't know
what I think, Gabe.

1744
01:21:04,962 --> 01:21:09,490
I'm only 1 1 .

1745
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,127
I don't think
I'm ready to be in love.

1746
01:21:13,237 --> 01:21:15,797
I'm not ready,
and I'm doing it.

1747
01:21:15,906 --> 01:21:17,840
But it wasn't that easy.

1748
01:21:17,942 --> 01:21:19,705
I guess love never is.

1749
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:22,677
Maybe I was wrong.

1750
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:25,044
Maybe... maybe girls
don't mature faster.

1751
01:21:25,149 --> 01:21:26,116
No, they do...

1752
01:21:26,217 --> 01:21:28,082
they do,
you know they do.

1753
01:21:28,185 --> 01:21:30,153
You even said so at the park.

1754
01:21:30,254 --> 01:21:32,154
We at least mature
at the same rate.

1755
01:21:34,158 --> 01:21:35,989
I don't know
what mature is anymore.

1756
01:21:40,364 --> 01:21:44,164
But I'm really happy you came.

1757
01:21:50,074 --> 01:21:52,736
Do you want
to dance, Gabe?

1758
01:21:52,843 --> 01:21:53,810
Dance?

1759
01:21:55,146 --> 01:21:57,979
Sure, what the hell?

1760
01:22:02,019 --> 01:22:09,755
( jazz ballad )

1761
01:22:11,962 --> 01:22:15,193
As I held onto Rosemary
Telesco for dear life...

1762
01:22:15,299 --> 01:22:17,426
we both knew the truth.

1763
01:22:17,535 --> 01:22:19,765
She was going off to camp...

1764
01:22:19,870 --> 01:22:22,532
and eventually, private school.

1765
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:24,938
We were on different roads,
she and me.

1766
01:22:25,042 --> 01:22:27,977
Two ships that passed
in Sheep Meadow.

1767
01:22:37,154 --> 01:22:38,883
( continues )

1768
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:42,422
See, this is just like
I told you.

1769
01:22:42,526 --> 01:22:45,120
Same thing I knew
getting into this whole mess..

1770
01:22:45,229 --> 01:22:48,756
Love ends.

1771
01:22:51,068 --> 01:22:52,968
Hey, Mr. Gabe.
How goes it?

1772
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:54,230
Hey, Ralph.

1773
01:22:54,338 --> 01:22:55,703
WoMAN:
Hold the door, please.

1774
01:22:55,806 --> 01:22:58,900
( woman laughing )

1775
01:23:00,978 --> 01:23:04,414
( song ends )

1776
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:10,046
The truth is,
you come into this world alone

1777
01:23:10,154 --> 01:23:13,282
and leave it
the exact same way.

1778
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:15,483
Home.

1779
01:23:38,282 --> 01:23:41,149
( laughing in distance )

1780
01:23:47,191 --> 01:23:49,455
( laughter )

1781
01:23:54,531 --> 01:23:57,125
( laughter continues )

1782
01:24:04,408 --> 01:24:05,875
Who are these strangers...

1783
01:24:05,976 --> 01:24:08,103
laughing in
my mother's bedroom?

1784
01:24:08,212 --> 01:24:10,737
I've only seen them
in pictures.

1785
01:24:10,848 --> 01:24:12,475
Hi.

1786
01:24:12,583 --> 01:24:15,552
( laughing )

1787
01:24:15,653 --> 01:24:18,816
Um, everything okay?

1788
01:24:18,923 --> 01:24:20,356
Yeah.
We were just talking

1789
01:24:20,457 --> 01:24:23,551
about how horrible
our honeymoon was.

1790
01:24:23,661 --> 01:24:25,128
( chuckles ):
Yeah?

1791
01:24:25,229 --> 01:24:26,457
Key West.

1792
01:24:26,563 --> 01:24:29,589
Everything that could
possibly go wrong...

1793
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:31,133
An unmitigated disaster.

1794
01:24:31,235 --> 01:24:33,430
It wasn't even a tropical storm.
Remember that?

1795
01:24:33,537 --> 01:24:35,937
- Like yesterday.
- It was awful.

1796
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:37,200
We lost our luggage.

1797
01:24:37,308 --> 01:24:38,741
God, you were so sick.

1798
01:24:38,842 --> 01:24:40,571
( both groan )

1799
01:24:40,678 --> 01:24:42,669
God, I'm hungry.
What time is it?

1800
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:44,270
oh, wow.

1801
01:24:44,381 --> 01:24:46,349
We should get
something to eat.

1802
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:49,248
All of us?

1803
01:24:49,353 --> 01:24:51,947
Yeah. We should, uh...

1804
01:24:52,056 --> 01:24:55,048
Why don't we go down
to the place on the corner?

1805
01:24:55,159 --> 01:24:56,251
GABE:
Yeah.

1806
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:58,328
Place on the corner
sounds good.

1807
01:24:58,429 --> 01:25:00,158
ADAM:
It's getting cooler.

1808
01:25:00,264 --> 01:25:03,028
Yeah, we're gonna
need jackets.

1809
01:25:11,809 --> 01:25:13,436
I just cleared
some old stuff

1810
01:25:13,544 --> 01:25:15,512
out of the storage room.

1811
01:25:15,612 --> 01:25:18,672
( intro to ""In My Life'plays )

1812
01:25:24,054 --> 01:25:28,855
( pop )

1813
01:25:37,034 --> 01:25:39,628
You wanted a New York
love story?

1814
01:25:39,737 --> 01:25:42,433
There's a New York love story
for ya.

1815
01:25:42,539 --> 01:25:44,530
I told you
it wasn't gonna be pretty.

1816
01:25:44,641 --> 01:25:46,734
( continues )

1817
01:25:46,844 --> 01:25:49,074
Love is an ugly,
terrible business...

1818
01:25:49,179 --> 01:25:50,441
practiced by fools.

1819
01:25:50,547 --> 01:25:51,605
( Leslie laughs )

1820
01:25:51,715 --> 01:25:52,739
It'll trample your heart

1821
01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:55,045
and leave you bleeding
on the floor.

1822
01:25:55,152 --> 01:25:58,485
And what does it really get you
in the end?

1823
01:25:58,589 --> 01:26:00,955
Nothing but a few
incredible memories

1824
01:26:01,058 --> 01:26:02,719
that you can't ever shake.

1825
01:26:02,826 --> 01:26:04,418
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1826
01:26:05,996 --> 01:26:09,488
( continues )

1827
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,658
( thud )

1828
01:26:10,768 --> 01:26:12,065
The truth is...

1829
01:26:12,169 --> 01:26:14,296
there's gonna be other girls
out there.

1830
01:26:14,405 --> 01:26:15,531
I mean...

1831
01:26:15,639 --> 01:26:16,697
I hope.

1832
01:26:16,807 --> 01:26:18,638
( continues )

1833
01:26:18,742 --> 01:26:22,007
But I'm never gonna get
another fiirst love.

1834
01:26:24,214 --> 01:26:25,875
That one's always gonna be her.

1835
01:26:25,983 --> 01:26:28,508
( continues )

1836
01:26:48,672 --> 01:26:50,663
( song ends )

1837
01:26:55,045 --> 01:26:57,172
( alternative )

1838
01:27:25,175 --> 01:27:28,702
( continues )

1839
01:28:15,359 --> 01:28:17,190
( song ends )

1840
01:28:21,031 --> 01:28:23,522
( new song, alternative )

1841
01:28:56,967 --> 01:29:02,371
( continues )

1842
01:30:01,265 --> 01:30:03,233
( music ends )
