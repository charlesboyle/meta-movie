00:01:05,179 --> 00:01:06,881
Hi

3
00:01:08,816 --> 00:01:10,450
Hi.

4
00:01:12,487 --> 00:01:14,588
I'm Bob.

5
00:01:16,391 --> 00:01:18,291
Scott.

6
00:01:24,598 --> 00:01:25,999
Okay, there you go.
Good boy.

7
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:28,501
Wait, no, don't lick it off.
Don't. That's good.

8
00:01:28,736 --> 00:01:30,203
Okay.
I mean, look.

9
00:01:30,237 --> 00:01:32,039
Look how Cannibal's
doing it, see?

10
00:01:32,073 --> 00:01:33,473
<i>See there?
That's it.</i>

11
00:01:33,507 --> 00:01:35,241
Good boy.

12
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:36,976
I need them
on set, Scott.

13
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,378
Right away.
Okay, you know your lines?

14
00:01:39,412 --> 00:01:41,480
You know your lines?

15
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:48,988
Come on.

16
00:01:51,523 --> 00:01:55,160
<i>Lou says we can't do the
growl and the attack in one shot.</i>

17
00:01:55,194 --> 00:01:56,594
We can do it,

18
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:57,963
but we need to do it
in two separate pieces.

19
00:01:57,997 --> 00:02:00,132
We need to prep the dogs
separately for the attack.

20
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,167
I just don't understand
why we can't get it in one.

21
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:04,602
Because he's got the bite
suit on under his clothes,

22
00:02:04,637 --> 00:02:08,205
so the dogs see him
as a big old chew toy.

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,341
I mean, it's fun for
them, they love it.

24
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:13,310
It's a safety issue.

25
00:02:13,344 --> 00:02:16,380
Scene 37, take one.

26
00:02:16,414 --> 00:02:18,015
Speed!

27
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:20,450
A and B camera,
common mark.

28
00:02:22,453 --> 00:02:24,088
Brownie!

29
00:02:24,122 --> 00:02:25,589
Cannibal!

30
00:02:25,623 --> 00:02:27,792
Bullet!

31
00:02:27,826 --> 00:02:29,860
Right here, boys.

32
00:02:29,895 --> 00:02:32,229
- We set?
- Set.

33
00:02:32,264 --> 00:02:33,697
And action!

34
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:56,785
<i>Scottie.
Your mother called.</i>

35
00:02:59,622 --> 00:03:01,323
<i>What did she want?</i>

36
00:03:01,357 --> 00:03:03,658
To see you.

37
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,963
- Do I have to?
- No.

38
00:03:07,997 --> 00:03:09,331
Joe.

39
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:14,135
No, of course not,
but... she's your mother.

40
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:17,739
She says she's doing
much better.

41
00:03:17,773 --> 00:03:20,275
<i>- For how long this time?
- Joe, stop.</i>

42
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,177
I'll think about it.

43
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:24,313
<i>Humph.</i>

44
00:03:24,347 --> 00:03:27,882
Oh, and a man named
Bob Black called.

45
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:30,351
Oh, okay.

46
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:33,187
Is that one of them
San Francisco fellas?

47
00:03:33,222 --> 00:03:36,257
No. He's from here.
West Hollywood.

48
00:03:37,192 --> 00:03:39,060
Oh.

49
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:48,268
<i>- Hey, cheeks!
- Shh!</i>

50
00:03:48,302 --> 00:03:49,970
This is
where you live?

51
00:03:50,004 --> 00:03:52,038
Yeah. Why?

52
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:55,308
You must have moved in after the
Clampetts left for Beverly Hills.

53
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,378
Bye, Rose.
I'll see you tomorrow!

54
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:00,312
- Have a good time!
- Okay.

55
00:04:00,347 --> 00:04:02,248
This is Bob.

56
00:04:02,282 --> 00:04:05,650
- Oh, hi, Bob.
- Hi, Rose.

57
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:15,427
<i>And now,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

58
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:17,462
<i>the star of the show...</i>

59
00:04:17,497 --> 00:04:20,699
<i>the man who's famous
throughout the world...</i>

60
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:23,302
<i>for his candelabra...</i>

61
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:25,537
<i>and his piano...</i>

62
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:28,473
<i>Mr. Showmanship...</i>

63
00:04:28,508 --> 00:04:30,509
<i>Liberace!</i>

64
00:04:54,565 --> 00:04:55,732
Hey!

65
00:05:04,242 --> 00:05:06,944
Now, this next part of the
boogie woogie is so strange,

66
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:09,046
it really calls
for an explanation.

67
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,149
<i>It's called
a boogie woogie break.</i>

68
00:05:12,183 --> 00:05:15,352
When I'm playing it
and I stop at a certain point...

69
00:05:15,386 --> 00:05:18,655
you're going to think
I've forgotten the music.

70
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:20,656
But I didn't forget
the music.

71
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,758
There's just no music
written for that part.

72
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:25,061
That's why they call it
a break.

73
00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:29,332
Hey!

74
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,574
Oh, this is fun.

75
00:05:39,608 --> 00:05:41,076
Let's try something.

76
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,511
Suppose only the ladies
in the audience

77
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:45,213
<i>this time, okay?</i>

78
00:05:45,247 --> 00:05:47,515
<i>All the girls together.</i>

79
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:52,120
Hey!

80
00:05:59,962 --> 00:06:02,097
Oh, that was
terrific.

81
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:06,101
Okay, fellas.
It's your turn now.

82
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,372
Hey!

83
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:21,648
I love it!
That was terrific!

84
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,417
You see, George?
I told you

85
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,619
<i>men do come
to my concerts.</i>

86
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,422
<i>Well, I really appreciate it.</i>

87
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,224
And I know somebody else
out in the audience

88
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:34,560
who appreciates it, too.
And that's my mom.

89
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,729
<i>Mom, I tell you what.</i>

90
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:40,932
Let them hear it from you...
and I'll play it just for you.

91
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:42,935
Okay, Mom?

92
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:49,275
Hey!

93
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,685
Oh, Mom, you're in
the groove tonight.

94
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:02,220
I really
thank you all

95
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,523
for joining me
in this boogie woogie.

96
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,292
I'd like to try
a little experiment.

97
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,027
I've been playing
this boogie woogie

98
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,462
at eight beats
to the bar.

99
00:07:11,496 --> 00:07:13,397
I'd like to try
playing it now

100
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:15,999
at 16 beats
to the bar.

101
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:35,119
Wow!

102
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,655
He's incredible!

103
00:08:04,314 --> 00:08:06,781
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

104
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:08,417
<i>- Thank you.
- Bravo.</i>

105
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:10,185
You know...

106
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,755
No, that's all right.
Stare as long as you want.

107
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:16,624
I mean, you paid for it.

108
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:22,163
You know, I always get asked...
"How do you play the piano

109
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:25,367
with all those rings
on your fingers?"

110
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:29,404
And I always tell them,
"Very well indeed."

111
00:08:32,641 --> 00:08:34,775
Thank you.

112
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:38,712
And now I'd like
to introduce

113
00:08:38,747 --> 00:08:41,616
another pair
of piano-playing hands

114
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,084
to join me in a duet.

115
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:46,754
My protégé and friend,

116
00:08:46,788 --> 00:08:49,422
<i>Mr. Billy Leatherwood!</i>

117
00:08:56,597 --> 00:08:58,198
<i>Oh, look!</i>

118
00:08:58,232 --> 00:09:01,701
A matched pair of queens.

119
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,305
Oh.

120
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:09,208
It's funny that this crowd
would like something this gay.

121
00:09:09,242 --> 00:09:12,778
Oh, they have no idea he's gay.

122
00:09:29,762 --> 00:09:32,631
There's Ray.
See him? In the black.

123
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:35,700
Come on, come on!

124
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:39,237
Ray! Ray.

125
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:42,039
Bobby!

126
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:45,076
- I'm so glad you made it!
- We loved it. Thank you so much.

127
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,843
This is my friend,
Scott Thorson.

128
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,278
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

129
00:09:48,313 --> 00:09:50,581
That was really something.
Thank you.

130
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:52,816
- Come on back and say hi to Lee.
- You sure?

131
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,818
Yes, he'd love
to see you!

132
00:09:56,787 --> 00:09:59,189
Lee?
Look who's here!

133
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:03,659
- Hello, Bobby!
- Lee, you were fantastic!

134
00:10:03,694 --> 00:10:05,361
This is my friend,
Scott Thorson.

135
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:07,396
His first time
in Las Vegas.

136
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:09,833
A lost babe
in the woods, huh?

137
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:12,969
<i>It's like a Disney movie.
Little Bambi.</i>

138
00:10:13,003 --> 00:10:15,105
Very nice to meet you.

139
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:17,240
You were incredible
out there.

140
00:10:17,274 --> 00:10:20,075
Oh, I'm just
a piano player.

141
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,545
But everybody did seem to enjoy
themselves, didn't they?

142
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:26,616
You were great,
too, Billy.

143
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:31,320
Ray, why don't we fix
everybody a drink?

144
00:10:31,355 --> 00:10:33,355
- All right.
- I'm not going to have one.

145
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:35,690
I still have
another show to do.

146
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:38,025
What... you're going to
do that all over again?

147
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,694
I don't know
how you do that.

148
00:10:39,729 --> 00:10:41,829
Oh, aren't you sweet!

149
00:10:41,864 --> 00:10:43,732
It's not bad
for an old bag, huh?

150
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:45,667
<i>Oh, you look fantastic!</i>

151
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:48,202
<i>And those bits
with the audience are gold!</i>

152
00:10:48,237 --> 00:10:49,637
<i>They work every time.</i>

153
00:10:49,671 --> 00:10:52,005
<i>I stage this show
once a year.</i>

154
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,708
<i>It works the same way
every single night.</i>

155
00:10:54,743 --> 00:10:57,210
I'll tell you, when I was
working saloons in my youth--

156
00:10:57,245 --> 00:10:59,747
back in Milwaukee,
they called them saloons.

157
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:01,849
That's how old I am.

158
00:11:01,884 --> 00:11:03,785
I'm from Wisconsin, too.

159
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:05,886
No! You are?

160
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,021
Well, this
must be fate.

161
00:11:08,055 --> 00:11:10,691
<i>One night,
this audience asked me</i>

162
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:14,261
to play this popular hit parade
song called "Three Little Fishes".

163
00:11:14,296 --> 00:11:15,829
It barely had a melody,

164
00:11:15,863 --> 00:11:18,131
it wasn't a challenge
at all...

165
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,067
but I played it, you know,
and they were happy.

166
00:11:21,102 --> 00:11:24,136
And then, I don't know
where it came from...

167
00:11:24,171 --> 00:11:26,339
<i>but I got this inspiration
to play it</i>

168
00:11:26,373 --> 00:11:29,409
<i>as if it was composed
by Strauss.</i>

169
00:11:29,443 --> 00:11:31,277
And they loved it!
They ate it up!

170
00:11:31,312 --> 00:11:34,847
You would have thought that I invented the piano.

171
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:36,382
And I knew
right then

172
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:38,550
it was all about
giving them a good time.

173
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:40,519
<i>And that's what
I'm all about.</i>

174
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:44,856
<i>I love to give people
a good time.</i>

175
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,692
<i>Bobby, you boys
staying in town tonight?</i>

176
00:11:46,726 --> 00:11:49,060
<i>Oh, yes. It's too
late to drive back to L.A.</i>

177
00:11:49,094 --> 00:11:52,331
<i>Lee, why don't we have the
boys over for brunch tomorrow?</i>

178
00:11:52,366 --> 00:11:54,766
<i>No, that's
too much for you.</i>

179
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:56,668
No, no.
That's a great idea!

180
00:11:56,703 --> 00:11:58,002
Of course!
Let's do it.

181
00:11:58,037 --> 00:11:59,871
But after 3:00,
okay?

182
00:11:59,905 --> 00:12:02,407
'Cause I need
my beauty sleep.

183
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,300
Welcome, gypsies!

184
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:33,236
Is this a palace?

185
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,606
Lee thinks
he's King Ludwig II.

186
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,743
- Who's he?
- The Liberace of Bavaria.

187
00:12:39,777 --> 00:12:41,877
Oh, is he
a piano player, too?

188
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:43,345
No.

189
00:12:48,285 --> 00:12:49,886
Wow.

190
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,121
Almost time
for a dip.

191
00:12:57,394 --> 00:13:00,662
I'm sorry
I'm so informal.

192
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,898
So happy you all could come.

193
00:13:02,932 --> 00:13:05,233
Don't these things
belong in an oven?

194
00:13:05,268 --> 00:13:06,935
He's so mean
to my babies.

195
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:09,070
I mean,
this is my family.

196
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:10,706
And this is Baby Boy.

197
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,374
Baby Boy,

198
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:16,611
he's very old.
He's deaf, and he's blind.

199
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:18,279
I'm his
seeing eye person.

200
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:22,149
I could get something to
help clear up his eyes.

201
00:13:22,183 --> 00:13:25,219
<i>- Scott works with animals.
- Oh.</i>

202
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:27,588
I worked for a vet
you know, for a while,

203
00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:29,923
and we had a lot of poodles
with eye problems.

204
00:13:29,957 --> 00:13:31,958
Oh, that would be
fabulous!

205
00:13:31,992 --> 00:13:34,394
No one's been able to help
my little Baby Boy.

206
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:37,364
I hate
to see him suffer.

207
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,266
<i>I think my favorite review</i>

208
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:41,001
<i>is from San Francisco,</i>

209
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:44,371
<i>when they said:
"Liberace was no Rubinstein...</i>

210
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:47,407
<i>but then Rubinstein
is no Liberace."</i>

211
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:51,244
This is my houseboy, Carlucci.

212
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:54,347
He rules the roost
around here.

213
00:13:56,584 --> 00:13:58,618
<i>Thank you.</i>

214
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:02,220
Pig.

215
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:04,623
<i>- What?
- Pig in a blanket.</i>

216
00:14:04,658 --> 00:14:06,826
You want a pig
in a blanket?

217
00:14:10,797 --> 00:14:13,098
No. Thanks.

218
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:27,378
After lunch, I'll give
you a guided tour.

219
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:30,916
Great.

220
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:42,827
<i>I do all my own decorating.</i>

221
00:14:42,862 --> 00:14:44,662
I just love it.

222
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:47,398
I call this
"palatial kitsch".

223
00:14:47,432 --> 00:14:50,233
- Right.
- Don't you just love that?

224
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:52,202
I never saw
so many pianos.

225
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:54,137
Oh, I never touch them.

226
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:57,440
Mama made me play
every day in my childhood.

227
00:14:57,475 --> 00:14:59,342
Didn't have
any friends.

228
00:14:59,377 --> 00:15:02,579
So now I never play...
when I play.

229
00:15:04,582 --> 00:15:06,649
These are actual
Roman columns.

230
00:15:06,683 --> 00:15:09,018
<i>Ionic.</i>

231
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:17,894
I personally
support

232
00:15:17,928 --> 00:15:21,964
the entire Austrian
rhinestone business.

233
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:23,465
It's too bad
you're so big,

234
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,501
you could try
one of these on.

235
00:15:25,536 --> 00:15:29,238
So, Scott, do you have
any family left?

236
00:15:29,272 --> 00:15:31,007
Oh, no, not really.

237
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:36,178
My mom's been
in and out of places,

238
00:15:36,212 --> 00:15:38,013
<i>you know,
for my whole life.</i>

239
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:39,614
Oh, really?

240
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:42,784
And I have two sisters...
and a brother,

241
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:45,620
and then four
half-brothers and sisters...

242
00:15:45,655 --> 00:15:47,121
from two
different fathers.

243
00:15:47,156 --> 00:15:49,290
Most of them live
with their fathers.

244
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:52,093
The rest of us,
like me and Wayne,

245
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:53,894
we were sent
to state-run homes...

246
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:57,064
<i>and then Mom would come get us and
we'd live with her for a while,</i>

247
00:15:57,098 --> 00:16:00,200
<i>then... she'd have her troubles again
and they'd have to put her away</i>

248
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:03,503
<i>so we'd get split up
and sent to foster homes.</i>

249
00:16:03,538 --> 00:16:06,874
But I was really lucky.
I ended up with Rose and Joe.

250
00:16:06,908 --> 00:16:10,643
You know, a really nice
family, on a ranch..

251
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,846
<i>You know,
with animals.</i>

252
00:16:12,881 --> 00:16:15,382
Sure, because
it was a ranch!

253
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,017
What a story!

254
00:16:17,052 --> 00:16:20,588
You got everything but a
fire in the orphanage.

255
00:16:20,622 --> 00:16:24,458
But the ranch is where you
got to like animals, and...

256
00:16:24,492 --> 00:16:26,993
I guess.

257
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,796
And I am going to try and get
that medicine for Baby Boy.

258
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,264
You remembered
his name.

259
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:34,968
That would be
wonderful.

260
00:16:36,103 --> 00:16:38,537
I'm going to give you
my private number.

261
00:16:38,572 --> 00:16:40,707
<i>It's unlisted.</i>

262
00:16:42,141 --> 00:16:45,410
Now, I'm counting
on you...

263
00:16:45,444 --> 00:16:48,179
so don't you forget.

264
00:16:54,821 --> 00:16:57,355
You'd better not walk
onto my stage

265
00:16:57,389 --> 00:16:58,789
with a ketchup stain.

266
00:16:58,824 --> 00:17:01,826
Like anyone
would give a shit.

267
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,265
He's so unprofessional.

268
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:11,770
<i>- Hello?
- Hi. This is Scott... Thorson.</i>

269
00:17:11,804 --> 00:17:14,605
<i>- I'm sorry, who?
- Scott. I'm Bob's friend.</i>

270
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,541
<i>I was at L-- his house.
I have medicine for his dog.</i>

271
00:17:17,575 --> 00:17:18,609
Hold on.

272
00:17:18,644 --> 00:17:20,611
- A Scott somebody.
- Who?

273
00:17:20,646 --> 00:17:22,379
- Friend of Bob's. who was at your house.
- Oh, Scott!

274
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:24,015
He has medicine?

275
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:26,183
Scott, is that you?

276
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:29,186
Hi.
Um... Yeah...

277
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,855
Mr.--

278
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:34,390
<i>No, no. Please,
just call me Lee.</i>

279
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:35,892
Lee. Okay.

280
00:17:35,926 --> 00:17:37,661
I have
the medicine

281
00:17:37,695 --> 00:17:40,130
for your poodle.
For his eyes?

282
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:42,331
Oh, my savior!

283
00:17:42,366 --> 00:17:45,101
I was going to just

284
00:17:45,136 --> 00:17:47,369
tuck it in the mail
tomorrow morning...

285
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:50,806
and it should be there,
you know, in a few days.

286
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,909
Oh, no, no. I don't want Baby
Boy to have to wait that long.

287
00:17:53,943 --> 00:17:57,613
Why don't you just book a flight
and come up this evening?

288
00:17:57,648 --> 00:17:59,749
At my expense.

289
00:17:59,784 --> 00:18:03,819
It's not that important.

290
00:18:03,853 --> 00:18:06,955
Scott, why don't you let me
decide what's important.

291
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,591
You know, you'd be
doing me a great favor

292
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,393
if you'd fly up here
this evening.

293
00:18:11,427 --> 00:18:14,596
<i>And I promise you I'll fly
you right back to L.A.</i>

294
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,464
<i>after my first show.</i>

295
00:18:16,499 --> 00:18:20,001
<i>- I promise.
- Okay.</i>

296
00:18:22,171 --> 00:18:27,008
Alone at last.

297
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:30,144
Thank you so much for
bringing my baby's medicine.

298
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:33,980
No problem.
He's going to be fine.

299
00:18:34,015 --> 00:18:37,450
What would you like to do
with your life, Scott?

300
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,853
What's your dream?

301
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:41,421
I want to be
a veterinarian.

302
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:44,591
Oh, don't you
just love animals?

303
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,492
So do I.

304
00:18:46,528 --> 00:18:50,496
You know, because they
love you, no matter what.

305
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:54,400
That's what makes them
dumb animals, I guess.

306
00:18:54,435 --> 00:18:56,136
<i>If they really knew
who we were,</i>

307
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,239
they'd have nothing
to do with us.

308
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:05,411
Scott, I...

309
00:19:05,446 --> 00:19:07,412
I feel like
I can trust you.

310
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:11,117
<i>And I have to talk
to someone.</i>

311
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:16,355
I've got myself
in a terrible mess.

312
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,858
What is it?

313
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:22,994
It's Billy.
My protégé.

314
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:26,364
I've created a monster.
A monster!

315
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,199
I gave him everything.

316
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:31,269
- I put his name in lights-- I made him famous.
- What did he do?

317
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,239
Well, he's out of control!
He's ruining me!

318
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:37,475
He's ruining my image!
I can't stand bad publicity!

319
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,110
My fans, you know?

320
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:42,514
<i>Unfortunately,
they're not dumb animals.</i>

321
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,516
He's just... he's done
terrible things!

322
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,151
He's breaking
my heart.

323
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,387
It's just he's drinking heavily,
he's getting into fights.

324
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,889
And I can't
get rid of him!

325
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,792
He's under contract
for six months!

326
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,794
I'm going to be ruined!

327
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,797
I just wish his wife
would come and take him away.

328
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,632
<i>His wife?</i>

329
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:05,035
Hand me a towel, please.

330
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,006
Thank you.

331
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,477
I never know whether
people like me for me,

332
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:16,446
or what they can get
out of me.

333
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,882
You know,
because I'm Liberace.

334
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:22,484
<i>Walter Liberace,
for God's sakes!</i>

335
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:24,386
<i>I mean,
can you imagine?</i>

336
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:26,755
<i>I mean, Walter's fine
for Pidgeon,</i>

337
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,425
but Liberace?

338
00:20:29,459 --> 00:20:32,296
It was the only thing
my father gave me.

339
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,197
He was
a French horn player.

340
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:36,732
He left us
for an oboist.

341
00:20:38,702 --> 00:20:40,903
So that's why
you're so musical?

342
00:20:40,938 --> 00:20:42,805
No, that man had
nothing to do with it.

343
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,875
My talent
comes from God.

344
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:47,676
Everybody wants
a piece of me,

345
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:50,145
a piece
of the action.

346
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:53,748
My brother George, he
performs in some small club.

347
00:20:53,782 --> 00:20:55,250
You know what
the marquee says?

348
00:20:55,284 --> 00:20:57,853
"Liberace",
in big letters.

349
00:20:57,887 --> 00:21:00,288
I built that name.
It's my name.

350
00:21:00,323 --> 00:21:02,457
That's not his.

351
00:21:03,893 --> 00:21:06,460
"Gimme, gimme, gimme."

352
00:21:06,494 --> 00:21:10,264
No one I can trust,
no one I can talk to.

353
00:21:10,298 --> 00:21:13,968
I hate my life sometimes.
I really do.

354
00:21:14,002 --> 00:21:16,136
- No.
- No, it's true.

355
00:21:16,171 --> 00:21:19,806
No matter how many people are
around, I'm all by myself.

356
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:21,275
Like, I'm with people--

357
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:24,411
they're not really
my family or my friends.

358
00:21:24,445 --> 00:21:27,147
You know what
that feels like?

359
00:21:27,182 --> 00:21:30,351
Yeah. I do.

360
00:21:31,353 --> 00:21:33,988
Yes.

361
00:21:34,022 --> 00:21:36,090
Yes, you do.

362
00:21:37,058 --> 00:21:40,693
You've been good
for me, Scott.

363
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:42,595
When?

364
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:44,530
Now.
Just now.

365
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:47,100
- Oh, you mean talking and--
- Yes, you know.

366
00:21:47,134 --> 00:21:48,667
And listening.

367
00:21:48,702 --> 00:21:50,169
You're very good
at listening.

368
00:21:50,204 --> 00:21:53,339
People... take...

369
00:21:54,274 --> 00:21:56,674
You know what?

370
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:59,811
I have a great idea.

371
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,049
Why don't you come
work for me?

372
00:22:05,318 --> 00:22:06,818
As what?

373
00:22:06,852 --> 00:22:09,954
Well, you could be
my secretary.

374
00:22:09,988 --> 00:22:12,323
I don't type.

375
00:22:12,357 --> 00:22:15,127
<i>Hell, Scott, I can
pay people to type.</i>

376
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:17,695
I need a companion.
A bodyguard.

377
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,232
Someone to keep people
off my back.

378
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:23,601
Someone I can talk to
the way we talked tonight.

379
00:22:23,636 --> 00:22:26,637
<i>You'd be
my right-hand man.</i>

380
00:22:26,671 --> 00:22:29,640
You can take care
of the animals.

381
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:31,775
Please.

382
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,979
Say yes, Scott.

383
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:39,883
Would you close the
drapes on the window, Scott?

384
00:22:39,918 --> 00:22:42,185
Yeah.

385
00:22:43,387 --> 00:22:45,621
It's really pretty
at night.

386
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,590
I'm sorry.

387
00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:50,526
I didn't mean to
scare you like that.

388
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:52,662
Yeah, I just...

389
00:22:52,696 --> 00:22:57,167
Things
are moving really fast.

390
00:22:57,201 --> 00:22:59,401
Maybe I should just get
a room for tonight.

391
00:22:59,436 --> 00:23:00,535
Oh, nonsense.

392
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,538
Look, I completely
understand

393
00:23:03,573 --> 00:23:06,542
and I promise I'll stay
on my side of the bed.

394
00:23:06,577 --> 00:23:08,211
I promise.

395
00:23:46,147 --> 00:23:48,748
Good morning.

396
00:23:56,924 --> 00:23:59,560
Well, look who's up!

397
00:24:12,507 --> 00:24:14,348
<i>You're making a mistake here.
Listen to me.</i>

398
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:17,944
<i>- I worked for that old fag in his Hollywood house!
- Joe!</i>

399
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:19,711
Oh, I'm not saying it
for that.

400
00:24:19,746 --> 00:24:23,416
I'm saying it's not
a fit place for Scott!

401
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,551
You don't know him
like I know him.

402
00:24:25,585 --> 00:24:28,320
<i>Is this the kind of
life you want for yourself?</i>

403
00:24:28,355 --> 00:24:30,089
It's a job, Rose.

404
00:24:30,123 --> 00:24:31,723
And it pays better
than getting two.

405
00:24:31,758 --> 00:24:34,225
Yeah, and you know what
they call that kind of job.

406
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,428
That's not what this is.

407
00:24:36,462 --> 00:24:37,862
<i>Look, he's old.</i>

408
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:40,665
He doesn't like me
just for that.

409
00:24:40,699 --> 00:24:42,900
Do you even like
this man?

410
00:24:44,803 --> 00:24:47,672
Yeah. I really do.

411
00:24:47,706 --> 00:24:49,741
He's lonely.

412
00:24:50,676 --> 00:24:52,977
I can take care
of him.

413
00:24:53,011 --> 00:24:54,712
And he can
take care of me.

414
00:24:56,415 --> 00:24:58,816
My eyes
are open, Rose.

415
00:24:59,685 --> 00:25:01,519
I promise.

416
00:25:36,653 --> 00:25:38,286
Mr. Thorson!

417
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:39,921
Seymour Heller,
Lee's manager.

418
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,690
Lee's expecting you.

419
00:25:48,865 --> 00:25:50,899
Is it any good?

420
00:25:50,934 --> 00:25:52,968
It's amazing.

421
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,804
I love to cook.

422
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,942
We'll be a couple
of fat biddies in no time.

423
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,245
Great,
'cause I love to eat.

424
00:26:08,284 --> 00:26:09,884
Come here, you.

425
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:25,732
She's going to see us.

426
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:29,202
People only see
what they want to see, Scott.

427
00:26:34,942 --> 00:26:38,312
Oh, God! Oh, God!

428
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,846
Oh, my God.

429
00:26:48,922 --> 00:26:51,857
We'll go shopping
tomorrow.

430
00:26:53,561 --> 00:26:55,861
After cooking and sex,

431
00:26:55,896 --> 00:26:59,665
I think shopping's the reason
to get up every day.

432
00:26:59,699 --> 00:27:02,434
And it helps
so many people.

433
00:27:03,903 --> 00:27:06,971
Do you mind if I ask you
something?

434
00:27:07,006 --> 00:27:10,108
How do you stay hard
for so long? I mean...

435
00:27:10,142 --> 00:27:13,044
that was the fourth time
since lunch.

436
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:16,380
You make me feel
so young.

437
00:27:17,849 --> 00:27:20,284
And I've had implants.

438
00:27:21,587 --> 00:27:25,691
I've had quite a drive,
you know, as well

439
00:27:25,725 --> 00:27:30,428
and... you know,
I've had problems.

440
00:27:30,462 --> 00:27:33,531
And it's a terrible thing
when you have such a desire

441
00:27:33,565 --> 00:27:35,633
and the equipment
doesn't work.

442
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:37,535
It's like

443
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:40,037
wanting to sing
and being tone deaf.

444
00:27:40,071 --> 00:27:42,440
And no one knows.

445
00:27:42,474 --> 00:27:44,308
You're the only one
I told.

446
00:27:44,343 --> 00:27:45,909
You see what
you mean to me?

447
00:27:45,944 --> 00:27:48,044
Lee, I think--
just a minute.

448
00:27:48,078 --> 00:27:49,779
I should
just tell you...

449
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:53,316
I'm bisexual.

450
00:27:53,351 --> 00:27:55,752
I like women, too.

451
00:27:56,787 --> 00:27:59,489
Well, good for you.

452
00:27:59,523 --> 00:28:01,458
I love women!

453
00:28:01,492 --> 00:28:03,726
I wish I could be
that flexible.

454
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,729
Make things
so much easier.

455
00:28:06,763 --> 00:28:09,365
I am so sick
of getting fan mail

456
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:12,234
about my engagement
to Sonja Henie.

457
00:28:12,269 --> 00:28:14,069
As if I would marry
an ice skater.

458
00:28:14,103 --> 00:28:15,738
Please--
I mean, those thighs.

459
00:28:16,974 --> 00:28:21,510
No, I was a goner
from my first time.

460
00:28:21,544 --> 00:28:25,047
He was
a Green Bay Packer.

461
00:28:25,082 --> 00:28:27,083
He came to hear me play
at one of my saloons.

462
00:28:27,117 --> 00:28:28,350
I couldn't miss him--

463
00:28:28,385 --> 00:28:31,420
the guy was
the size of the door.

464
00:28:31,454 --> 00:28:34,023
That's how I lost
my virginity.

465
00:28:34,057 --> 00:28:37,592
Isn't that romantic?

466
00:28:37,626 --> 00:28:40,495
You know, I tried
to make myself love women.

467
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:43,031
I'd stare at women's bosoms
and their backsides,

468
00:28:43,065 --> 00:28:45,767
<i>you know, trying
to feel something.</i>

469
00:28:45,802 --> 00:28:49,570
You see, I knew...
from being Catholic

470
00:28:49,605 --> 00:28:52,506
what happened
to boys like me.

471
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,074
And I went
to confession.

472
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:58,345
Of course, I couldn't
confess everything.

473
00:28:58,379 --> 00:29:00,848
The problem was,
according to Catholics...

474
00:29:00,882 --> 00:29:04,751
not confessing a sin
is also considered a sin...

475
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:08,655
so, you know, I was damned
if I do, damned if I didn't.

476
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:12,459
I can't believe
you're still Catholic.

477
00:29:12,493 --> 00:29:14,128
Devout.

478
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:17,764
The turning point
for me...

479
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:21,268
was Kennedy
getting assassinated.

480
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:25,705
<i>I was working non-stop
and I was sick.</i>

481
00:29:25,739 --> 00:29:27,807
<i>I felt terrible.</i>

482
00:29:27,842 --> 00:29:29,342
<i>We found out later...</i>

483
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:32,979
<i>that when those heavy costumes
I wear get dry cleaned...</i>

484
00:29:33,013 --> 00:29:35,581
<i>they use this
tetrachloride solution.</i>

485
00:29:35,615 --> 00:29:37,884
<i>I would sweat...
and it'd get absorbed</i>

486
00:29:37,918 --> 00:29:42,087
<i>into my bloodstream...
and shut down my kidneys.</i>

487
00:29:42,121 --> 00:29:44,356
<i>Can you imagine?</i>

488
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,258
<i>But no one knew.</i>

489
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:48,960
<i>So I'm watching
the assassination on TV</i>

490
00:29:48,994 --> 00:29:51,329
<i>and I think... at least
I'll have a few days off.</i>

491
00:29:51,364 --> 00:29:54,632
<i>I mean, nobody's going to come
see me perform this weekend.</i>

492
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:59,103
<i>But, no.
No, Seymour made me work.</i>

493
00:29:59,137 --> 00:30:01,407
<i>They thought
I was dying.</i>

494
00:30:01,441 --> 00:30:04,108
<i>They couldn't figure out
what was wrong.</i>

495
00:30:04,142 --> 00:30:05,744
<i>I mean,
everything's bloated.</i>

496
00:30:05,778 --> 00:30:08,212
<i>I'm drowning
in my own fluids.</i>

497
00:30:08,247 --> 00:30:10,849
<i>They put me on dialysis
and I'm thinking...</i>

498
00:30:10,883 --> 00:30:14,519
<i>the only thing that's going to
get me through this is prayer.</i>

499
00:30:14,553 --> 00:30:16,988
<i>Sometime within these
36 hours of treatment...</i>

500
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:19,022
<i>I wake up,
and there's this nun</i>

501
00:30:19,056 --> 00:30:23,460
<i>in an all-white habit
sitting beside my bed.</i>

502
00:30:23,495 --> 00:30:24,928
<i>I said
I wanted to pray,</i>

503
00:30:24,962 --> 00:30:27,931
<i>and she told me
not to waste my strength.</i>

504
00:30:27,965 --> 00:30:31,268
<i>And she assured me
I would live.</i>

505
00:30:31,302 --> 00:30:35,238
<i>Next day, my kidneys
start to work.</i>

506
00:30:35,273 --> 00:30:37,440
<i>The doctors were amazed!</i>

507
00:30:37,474 --> 00:30:39,943
<i>They admitted to me
they had given up hope.</i>

508
00:30:39,977 --> 00:30:42,478
<i>So I asked
to see the nun...</i>

509
00:30:42,513 --> 00:30:45,048
<i>to thank her
for giving me strength,</i>

510
00:30:45,082 --> 00:30:47,850
<i>and... they said,
"Oh, no,</i>

511
00:30:47,885 --> 00:30:51,922
<i>there's no nun here
that fits that description."</i>

512
00:30:51,956 --> 00:30:55,825
<i>"There are no nuns here
that wear all-white habits."</i>

513
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:58,694
And I knew.

514
00:30:58,729 --> 00:31:01,597
I knew my life
would not have been spared

515
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:07,202
if being gay was the sin
that the Church said it was.

516
00:31:07,237 --> 00:31:11,140
I was saved... because
God looks upon me

517
00:31:11,174 --> 00:31:13,675
with special favor.

518
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:17,913
That nun...
was a messenger.

519
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:21,750
Wow.

520
00:31:21,784 --> 00:31:24,118
Isn't that something?

521
00:31:24,153 --> 00:31:27,989
But, Scott-- men, women--
you know, who cares?

522
00:31:28,023 --> 00:31:30,691
What's important
is to be yourself.

523
00:31:30,725 --> 00:31:33,194
You just be who you
are, baby boy.

524
00:31:47,977 --> 00:31:51,279
Don't eat all of this.

525
00:31:51,313 --> 00:31:55,349
You'll be angry that
your panties are tight.

526
00:31:55,383 --> 00:31:57,351
Ah-ooh.

527
00:31:57,385 --> 00:32:00,420
- You want some, Scott?
- Mm-mm.

528
00:32:04,292 --> 00:32:05,425
Mm!

529
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,961
These are delicious.

530
00:32:07,996 --> 00:32:09,863
Here.

531
00:32:09,897 --> 00:32:11,864
Have one.

532
00:32:15,568 --> 00:32:18,304
Does he
do that every night?

533
00:32:18,338 --> 00:32:20,639
Mm-hmm.

534
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:22,565
<i>♪ Have yourself
a merry little Christmas... ♪</i>

535
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:23,866
<i>Be careful, Scott.</i>

<i>♪ Let your heart

537
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,006

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,814
He made you
a pesto panini.

541
00:33:38,848 --> 00:33:40,683
Oh.

542
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:46,122
Did you bring
my Fresca?

543
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:51,693
What?

544
00:33:55,331 --> 00:33:58,032
Here's what's going to happen.
You listening?

545
00:33:58,067 --> 00:34:01,002
You think you're so hot
and sexy with your hard ass

546
00:34:01,036 --> 00:34:03,770
and that bisexual
bullshit.

547
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:05,672
You know how many
there have been?

548
00:34:05,707 --> 00:34:08,041
Bobby, Hans, Chase.

549
00:34:08,076 --> 00:34:09,776
Oh, and some
country boy stripper

550
00:34:09,811 --> 00:34:12,513
who was so dumb he wore
his G-string backwards.

551
00:34:12,547 --> 00:34:14,515
He got rid
of all of them.

552
00:34:14,549 --> 00:34:16,049
But I'm still here.

553
00:34:16,084 --> 00:34:19,220
And one day,
Lee is going to call Seymour...

554
00:34:19,254 --> 00:34:21,855
and he's going to tell him
to get rid of you.

555
00:34:27,562 --> 00:34:29,430
Lee?

556
00:34:31,933 --> 00:34:33,734
Lee?

557
00:34:35,702 --> 00:34:37,737
Oh, excuse me.
I was--

558
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:42,175
Lee?

559
00:34:42,209 --> 00:34:45,378
Right here,
baby boy.

560
00:34:46,913 --> 00:34:50,850
<i>You've never seen me
without my hair, have you?</i>

561
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:55,787
Terrible.
Terrible, isn't it?

562
00:34:55,821 --> 00:34:59,691
But the pieces,
they're great.

563
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:01,760
You know what
I'm going to do?

564
00:35:01,794 --> 00:35:04,396
I'm going to put you
in charge of my wigs.

565
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,931
<i>I only do that
for people I trust.</i>

566
00:35:06,966 --> 00:35:10,835
<i>- Would you like that?
- Lee, I'm sorry, but...</i>

567
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:13,004
I think maybe
this was a mistake.

568
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:15,507
What's wrong?
What?

569
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:16,975
<i>I can't do this.</i>

570
00:35:17,009 --> 00:35:20,011
I can't live like this,
in this house.

571
00:35:20,046 --> 00:35:22,181
I mean, everybody
looks down on me.

572
00:35:22,215 --> 00:35:24,982
<i>Carlucci is always on
my ass about something.</i>

573
00:35:25,016 --> 00:35:27,818
<i>He's treating me
like I'm the houseboy.</i>

574
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,588
I just, I can't
live like this.

575
00:35:30,622 --> 00:35:31,689
I'm sorry.

576
00:35:31,723 --> 00:35:34,858
I don't want
to see you depressed.

577
00:35:34,893 --> 00:35:38,596
When you have a sad face,
then I feel sad.

578
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:43,200
But it's not sad, it's...
This isn't working.

579
00:35:43,234 --> 00:35:46,002
Well, then I've failed.

580
00:35:46,036 --> 00:35:48,171
Because you have
made me so happy...

581
00:35:48,206 --> 00:35:50,907
<i>over these past
few months.</i>

582
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:55,744
And if I haven't
made you happy...

583
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:59,515
Your happiness means
everything to me, Scott.

584
00:36:02,687 --> 00:36:06,523
I just don't know
what to do.

585
00:36:47,495 --> 00:36:49,829
<i>Why do I love you?</i>

586
00:36:49,864 --> 00:36:53,367
<i>I love you
not only for what you are</i>

587
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:56,871
<i>But for what I am
when I'm with you</i>

588
00:36:56,905 --> 00:37:01,908
<i>I love you not only for what
you have made of yourself</i>

589
00:37:01,942 --> 00:37:05,646
<i>But for what
you are making of me.</i>

590
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,449
<i>I love you for ignoring
the possibilities...</i>

591
00:37:09,484 --> 00:37:12,653
<i>of the fool in me</i>

592
00:37:12,687 --> 00:37:15,854
<i>And for accepting
the possibilities</i>

593
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:18,624
<i>of the good in me.</i>

594
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:29,168
<i>Why do I love you?</i>

595
00:37:29,202 --> 00:37:32,270
<i>I love you
for closing your eyes</i>

596
00:37:32,305 --> 00:37:35,373
<i>to the discords in me.</i>

597
00:37:35,408 --> 00:37:38,677
<i>And for adding
to the music in me</i>

598
00:37:38,711 --> 00:37:41,680
<i>by worshipful listening</i>

599
00:37:49,555 --> 00:37:51,356
No, I don't
like it.

600
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,890
- It makes it better.
- I don't want it.

601
00:37:52,925 --> 00:37:55,860
Oh. Oh!

602
00:38:00,566 --> 00:38:04,368
I've always
wanted children.

603
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:08,905
I regret that--
not having children.

604
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,376
I love Christmas.
I think I'd be a good daddy,

605
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:16,947
- don't you think?
- Oh, you're such a loving man.

606
00:38:16,981 --> 00:38:19,015
Mmm.

607
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,451
<i>Well, maybe
I'll adopt you.</i>

608
00:38:24,254 --> 00:38:27,557
I want you to take the money
that you're earning...

609
00:38:27,591 --> 00:38:30,593
and buy a house
here in Las Vegas.

610
00:38:32,463 --> 00:38:34,296
I'll co-sign.

611
00:38:34,331 --> 00:38:35,930
But it'll be
in your name,

612
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:39,769
so... you'll have
some security.

613
00:38:40,804 --> 00:38:42,304
Would you like that?

614
00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:46,275
Lee...
are you serious?

615
00:38:47,711 --> 00:38:50,413
I want to be everything
to you, Scott.

616
00:38:50,447 --> 00:38:53,815
I want to be
father... brother...

617
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:57,853
lover... best friend.

618
00:38:57,887 --> 00:38:59,788
Everything.

619
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:05,093
You know I love you.

620
00:39:07,129 --> 00:39:10,831
Does that mean
anything to you?

621
00:39:10,866 --> 00:39:12,933
Maybe all
those years...

622
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:17,137
all those
foster homes...

623
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:20,340

643
00:40:22,468 --> 00:40:26,504
I was the first
matinee idol

644
00:40:26,538 --> 00:40:29,007
in television.

645
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:31,943
I was the one had the idea
of putting the candelabra

646
00:40:31,978 --> 00:40:33,678
up on the piano,
you know?

647
00:40:33,712 --> 00:40:37,114
I saw an old
Merle Oberon movie

648
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:39,984
when I got the idea.
From, uh... about Chopin.

649
00:40:40,018 --> 00:40:43,187
What was the name of that...?
"A Song to Remember"!

650
00:40:43,221 --> 00:40:45,522
Really? That's like
your trademark!

651
00:40:45,556 --> 00:40:48,459
I know.
Who knew?

652
00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:50,927
Wow.

653
00:40:50,962 --> 00:40:52,495
Huh.

654
00:40:52,529 --> 00:40:55,431
So, really, no matter
what you did,

655
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:59,635
you were just...
meant to be famous.

656
00:40:59,669 --> 00:41:01,971
I guess so.

657
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:04,474
Hmm.

658
00:41:08,111 --> 00:41:10,578
( Groans

659
00:41:10,613 --> 00:41:13,216
Hello.

660
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:16,552
Oh, hi.
Yeah, hold on.

661
00:41:16,586 --> 00:41:18,087
It's Seymour.

662
00:41:18,122 --> 00:41:21,024
I told him not to call
this number.

663
00:41:22,292 --> 00:41:24,759
I told you not to call
this number.

664
00:41:24,793 --> 00:41:26,094
Hi, Lee.
I'm sorry,

665
00:41:26,129 --> 00:41:27,295
I have to talk to you
about these dates.

666
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:28,930
We've got six months
of bookings.

667
00:41:28,964 --> 00:41:31,400
I already told you
the dates I would do.

668
00:41:31,434 --> 00:41:33,601
I'm not working after Thanksgiving

669
00:41:33,636 --> 00:41:36,905
during the holidays.
Especially now.

670
00:41:36,939 --> 00:41:39,206
But you can make double
on holiday shows.

671
00:41:39,241 --> 00:41:40,707
Take a vacation later.

672
00:41:40,742 --> 00:41:43,244
Seymour,
I do not want to be

673
00:41:43,278 --> 00:41:45,413
the richest piano player
in the grave.

674
00:41:45,447 --> 00:41:46,980
- Forget it.
- No, definitely not.

675
00:41:47,015 --> 00:41:48,482
You're already
working too hard.

676
00:41:48,517 --> 00:41:52,286
Lee, give the phone to Scott.
I have a question for him.

677
00:41:55,156 --> 00:41:56,456
Hey, Seymour.

678
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,757
Hey, Scott.

679
00:41:57,791 --> 00:41:59,659
Why don't you stay
out of my fucking business?

680
00:41:59,693 --> 00:42:01,361
Now give me back
to Lee.

681
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:09,603
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

682
00:42:09,637 --> 00:42:12,038
No, you cannot come
for dinner tomorrow night.

683
00:42:12,073 --> 00:42:14,441
I'm making pork.

684
00:42:14,475 --> 00:42:17,077
Okay.
Bye-bye.

685
00:42:17,111 --> 00:42:19,879
Ay-yi-yi!
Oy!

686
00:42:19,913 --> 00:42:22,682
Doesn't he get insulted when you
don't invite him over for dinner?

687
00:42:22,716 --> 00:42:25,351
He gets 10% of every
dollar I earn.

688
00:42:25,386 --> 00:42:28,454
I don't have to
take him out for dinner.

689
00:42:28,488 --> 00:42:31,323
And I don't want
any company.

690
00:42:31,357 --> 00:42:36,695
I want my blond Adonis
all to myself.

691
00:42:39,865 --> 00:42:41,666
Oh, shit!

692
00:42:41,701 --> 00:42:43,701
Shit, shit, shit!

693
00:42:43,735 --> 00:42:46,537
- Carson!
- Oh, hurry! Hurry!

694
00:42:46,572 --> 00:42:49,707
<i>Have we missed
my performance?</i>

695
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:54,245
Oh. Tsk.

696
00:43:01,886 --> 00:43:05,756
<i>Oh, my Christ!
I look like my father!</i>

697
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:08,426
I look like
my father in drag!

698
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,930
I look like my father in
"Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte"!

699
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:16,366
I would say
a full face lift...

700
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,969
with silicone implants
to prevent the return

701
00:43:19,004 --> 00:43:20,938
of the lines
around the mouth.

702
00:43:20,972 --> 00:43:22,405
My feeling?

703
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,109
Why go through all of the
work and the money...

704
00:43:25,143 --> 00:43:27,244
just to have it all
fall down within a year?

705
00:43:27,278 --> 00:43:30,380
You pay good money,
it should last.

706
00:43:30,414 --> 00:43:33,149
Some of these doctors,
they keep you coming back

707
00:43:33,183 --> 00:43:35,718
and paying,
time after time.

708
00:43:35,753 --> 00:43:38,220
- I don't believe in it.
- No, you're right.

709
00:43:38,255 --> 00:43:40,289
You know, I had
all this done a while ago,

710
00:43:40,323 --> 00:43:44,460
but I don't think
he was as good as you are.

711
00:43:45,562 --> 00:43:47,263
I'm going to recommend
a deep face peel

712
00:43:47,297 --> 00:43:48,665
after the face lift.

713
00:43:48,699 --> 00:43:51,267
You're going
to look fabulous!

714
00:43:51,301 --> 00:43:53,335
You'll look as young
as Scott here.

715
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:55,838
Oh, thank you!
I feel so much better.

716
00:43:55,873 --> 00:43:57,940
I mean, that Carson show
was like looking

717
00:43:57,975 --> 00:44:01,744
at Dorian Gray
wither away in public.

718
00:44:01,779 --> 00:44:03,245
But what about
the press?

719
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,781
How do we keep this
a secret?

720
00:44:05,815 --> 00:44:08,784
We rent you a fully furnished
apartment under an alias

721
00:44:08,818 --> 00:44:10,719
until the bandages
come off.

722
00:44:10,753 --> 00:44:12,154
No one will know.

723
00:44:12,188 --> 00:44:15,557
After that, you can
recuperate as you like.

724
00:44:15,591 --> 00:44:17,826
Jack, I wish
I'd met you sooner.

725
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:20,161
I would still have
had a movie career!

726
00:44:20,195 --> 00:44:23,097
That was my real dream--
to be a movie star.

727
00:44:23,131 --> 00:44:26,433
Now, Jack, I want
to talk to you

728
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:28,936
about doing some surgery
on Scott here.

729
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,204
What?

730
00:44:30,238 --> 00:44:31,271
Fine.

731
00:44:31,306 --> 00:44:33,607
What would you like me
to do with Scott?

732
00:44:36,177 --> 00:44:39,579
I want you to make Scott
look like this.

733
00:44:40,582 --> 00:44:42,282
Can you do that?

734
00:44:45,153 --> 00:44:46,587
Oh, I see.

735
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:49,256
Yes, I think
I can do what you want.

736
00:44:50,225 --> 00:44:52,358
He's going to need
a nose job.

737
00:44:52,392 --> 00:44:55,161
And I'm going to have to
restructure his cheekbones

738
00:44:55,196 --> 00:44:57,530
and his chin
with silicone implants,

739
00:44:57,564 --> 00:44:59,398
<i>but it's not
impossible.</i>

740
00:44:59,433 --> 00:45:02,902
But first we have to
slim him down!

741
00:45:02,937 --> 00:45:06,773
I have a terrific diet.
The California Diet.

742
00:45:06,807 --> 00:45:10,876
Guaranteed loss of 15 pounds
in four weeks.

743
00:45:20,286 --> 00:45:22,020
<i>Are you fucking kidding me?</i>

744
00:45:22,055 --> 00:45:25,022
The man wants to spend money to
make you thinner, prettier,

745
00:45:25,057 --> 00:45:27,324
and younger and you are
thinking about not doing it.

746
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:28,893
<i>But I am young.</i>

747
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:32,131
Honey, in gay years,
you're Judy

748
00:45:32,165 --> 00:45:34,733
during the Sid Luft
obese period.

749
00:45:34,768 --> 00:45:37,102
Really?

750
00:45:37,137 --> 00:45:39,704
They were talking about me
like I wasn't even there.

751
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:42,740
If Lee doesn't get what
he wants, you won't be.

752
00:45:43,976 --> 00:45:47,078
Well, I guess
I should be flattered,

753
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:49,947
him wanting me
to look like him.

754
00:45:49,982 --> 00:45:52,183
<i>Imitation's
the highest form.</i>

755
00:45:52,217 --> 00:45:55,253
That's what they tell
drag queens when they're born.

756
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,688
Oh, I don't know, man.

757
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:00,957
I mean, won't it be weird
looking in a mirror

758
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:02,525
and not recognizing
myself?

759
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,262
Should we take the Auburn
or the Camaro?

760
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:18,874
I just don't understand
why I cannot keep my hair on

761
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:21,143
during the procedure.

762
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:25,148
If I die, I want you
to get in here--

763
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:27,284
I don't care if you have
to slap it on with Elmer's--

764
00:46:27,319 --> 00:46:29,018
before anybody
sees me.

765
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:31,721
You're not
going to die.

766
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:11,893
Oh, you are doing
so well, Lee!

767
00:47:11,927 --> 00:47:14,062
Isn't he doing well?

768
00:47:15,298 --> 00:47:19,067
I guess it's time to get
started on you, huh?

769
00:47:19,101 --> 00:47:21,870
First, we're going to do
something about that weight.

770
00:47:24,306 --> 00:47:26,574
The California Diet.

771
00:47:26,608 --> 00:47:31,846
Those pounds
will just fall off!

772
00:47:58,305 --> 00:48:01,607
You look, easily,
right now...

773
00:48:01,641 --> 00:48:04,576
like a man
in his mid-40s.

774
00:48:08,248 --> 00:48:10,883
Will I be able
to close my eyes?

775
00:48:10,918 --> 00:48:12,551
Not entirely.

776
00:48:12,585 --> 00:48:16,122
But this way, you'll always be
able to see people's expressions

777
00:48:16,156 --> 00:48:18,891
<i>when they see
how fabulous you look.</i>

778
00:48:22,728 --> 00:48:25,230
Sweetie,
you're snoring.

779
00:48:31,737 --> 00:48:35,006
Lee!

780
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:49,420
Sweetie, you're snoring.

781
00:49:04,735 --> 00:49:07,438
Oh, look at you!

782
00:49:07,472 --> 00:49:10,773
- My Adonis is coming back.
- Really?

783
00:49:10,807 --> 00:49:12,908
Come here.

784
00:49:25,388 --> 00:49:28,056
What are these for?

785
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:30,492
Post surgery.

786
00:49:30,526 --> 00:49:33,261
Okay, but I stay
on the California Diet?

787
00:49:33,296 --> 00:49:34,896
Perfectly safe.

788
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,798
Just keep
taking those.

789
00:49:36,832 --> 00:49:39,234
And one of these
is a prescription

790
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,202
for my own
special diet pill.

791
00:49:41,236 --> 00:49:45,106
Uh, I want
a dimple on my chin.

792
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,808
Scott, Lee doesn't have
a dimple on his chin.

793
00:49:47,842 --> 00:49:49,910
I know, but...

794
00:49:49,944 --> 00:49:52,279
You know,
it's my face.

795
00:49:52,314 --> 00:49:54,883
Not too deep,
just a little one.

796
00:49:57,019 --> 00:49:58,620
Okay.

797
00:49:59,555 --> 00:50:01,656
You think
Lee'll be mad?

798
00:50:08,796 --> 00:50:13,000
Sleep tight,
my baby boy.

799
00:50:13,034 --> 00:50:15,769
I'll see you
on the other side.

800
00:51:46,757 --> 00:51:49,626
<i>Scott, it's
so good to hear your voice.</i>

801
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,393
I'm sorry, Rose.

802
00:51:51,428 --> 00:51:53,195
Just with Lee's schedule,
it's been so crazy.

803
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:55,531
I didn't say it
to make you feel bad.

804
00:51:55,565 --> 00:51:57,165
So talk to me.
How are you?

805
00:51:57,199 --> 00:51:58,934
You taking care
of yourself?

806
00:51:58,968 --> 00:52:00,102
I'm great.

807
00:52:00,136 --> 00:52:02,570
I've lost a whole lot
of weight, actually.

808
00:52:02,605 --> 00:52:05,306
<i>What for? You always
had such a nice build.</i>

809
00:52:05,341 --> 00:52:07,075
No, no,
it's a healthy thing.

810
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:09,077
It's the California Diet.

811
00:52:09,112 --> 00:52:10,779
Lee and I
did it together.

812
00:52:10,813 --> 00:52:13,848
<i>He's really
into self-improvement.</i>

813
00:52:13,882 --> 00:52:15,850
Oh.

814
00:52:15,884 --> 00:52:19,954
How is
Mr. Lee-berace?

815
00:52:19,988 --> 00:52:21,656
He's great.

816
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:24,424
Actually,

817
00:52:24,459 --> 00:52:26,995
we're going to see
some lawyers tomorrow...

818
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:29,997
because, um, he wants
to adopt me.

819
00:52:30,899 --> 00:52:33,801
<i>Adopt you?</i>

820
00:52:33,835 --> 00:52:36,003
I don't understand.

821
00:52:36,038 --> 00:52:41,676
<i>Why would a grown man want
to adopt another grown man?</i>

822
00:52:43,045 --> 00:52:45,611
So we can be family.

823
00:52:47,214 --> 00:52:49,983
I don't understand.

824
00:52:50,017 --> 00:52:52,118
In the state of Nevada,
if you're over 18,

825
00:52:52,153 --> 00:52:53,753
you have the right
to be adopted...

826
00:52:53,788 --> 00:52:55,521
whether your parents
are living or deceased.

827
00:52:55,556 --> 00:52:57,256
So it won't be
an issue.

828
00:52:57,291 --> 00:52:59,825
Well, then--
that's great.

829
00:52:59,859 --> 00:53:03,095
Now, John, I want to make
this perfectly clear.

830
00:53:03,129 --> 00:53:04,629
I don't want a word
of this out there

831
00:53:04,664 --> 00:53:07,933
until the adoption is complete.
Not a word.

832
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:11,636
<i>As your lawyer, I'm legally
bound not to discuss it.</i>

833
00:53:11,671 --> 00:53:15,540
I know, but, you know,
in casual conversation.

834
00:53:16,441 --> 00:53:18,110
No one...

835
00:53:18,144 --> 00:53:21,080
<i>I mean, no one has ever
been closer to me</i>

836
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:24,149
than this young man.

837
00:53:24,184 --> 00:53:27,052
I want to make sure
he's taken care of forever...

838
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:31,356
no matter what
happens to me.

839
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:34,592
<i>The coat costs $300,000.</i>

840
00:53:34,626 --> 00:53:38,196
It is made entirely
of virgin white fox.

841
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:40,064
The train
is 16 feet long--

842
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:41,632
that is the longest
in the world.

843
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:45,636
It was designed exclusively
for him by Anna Nateece.

844
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:50,874
It has $100,000 worth of
Austrian crystals which line it.

845
00:53:50,908 --> 00:53:53,643
And that is why it is the
only coat in the world

846
00:53:53,677 --> 00:53:56,146
with its own
chauffeur and car.

847
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:58,681
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

848
00:53:58,716 --> 00:54:00,383
- Would you sign this?
- Sure, yes.

849
00:54:00,417 --> 00:54:02,018
<i>- Please. My name is Sue.
- Sue.</i>

850
00:54:02,053 --> 00:54:03,886
<i>But, dear, you can ask him.</i>

851
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,955
Oh, I know.

852
00:54:11,095 --> 00:54:12,595
There you are.

853
00:54:13,564 --> 00:54:16,199
- $3.
- Thank you.

854
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:23,338
<i>You're Liberace's
son, aren't you?</i>

855
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:28,577
<i>So, how you doing, Ma?</i>

856
00:54:28,611 --> 00:54:31,013
You happy?

857
00:54:31,047 --> 00:54:33,115
It is what it is.

858
00:54:34,517 --> 00:54:37,451
Well, is the nurse
working out for you?

859
00:54:37,486 --> 00:54:39,353
Yeah, I think so.

860
00:54:39,388 --> 00:54:41,622
I mean,
they're fine.

861
00:54:43,859 --> 00:54:46,627
So, is there
anything that you need?

862
00:54:46,662 --> 00:54:48,196
No.

863
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:51,732
No, I'm just lonely,
that's all.

864
00:54:51,767 --> 00:54:56,270
You can't do anything
for loneliness.

865
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:01,542
Well, you've got
George and Dora, right?

866
00:55:01,576 --> 00:55:04,312
They're a few minutes away. Don't
they come down for a visit?

867
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:07,782
Same faces.

868
00:55:07,816 --> 00:55:10,884
Every day,
same faces.

869
00:55:15,756 --> 00:55:18,125
So, do you want me
to bring Angie from L.A.?

870
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:20,060
- Bring her down?
- Oh, no!

871
00:55:20,094 --> 00:55:21,728
No, don't need that.

872
00:55:21,762 --> 00:55:24,363
Please, I don't
need that. No.

873
00:55:24,397 --> 00:55:27,867
<i>No. All I need
is to be near you.</i>

874
00:55:27,901 --> 00:55:32,104
But you know out here,
all alone, I don't know...

875
00:55:32,139 --> 00:55:34,573
it's every day the same.
You know,

876
00:55:34,607 --> 00:55:36,309
but you, you have--
it's too much.

877
00:55:36,343 --> 00:55:39,411
Oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

878
00:55:42,081 --> 00:55:45,016
But I know...
it's too much.

879
00:55:45,051 --> 00:55:46,952
You always going
to give everything,

880
00:55:46,986 --> 00:55:47,986
you're so busy--

881
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:49,754
<i>it's too much!
I understand.</i>

882
00:55:49,788 --> 00:55:53,392
Give my son some more
iced tea, please.

883
00:55:53,426 --> 00:55:55,594
<i>This will be good
for you, not this.</i>

884
00:55:55,628 --> 00:55:57,062
Mm-mm.

885
00:56:04,303 --> 00:56:06,404
Thank you.

886
00:56:06,438 --> 00:56:09,007
Oh, thank you so much.

887
00:56:09,041 --> 00:56:10,675
Oh.

888
00:56:10,709 --> 00:56:13,077
You're all
just so wonderful.

889
00:56:13,111 --> 00:56:15,880
I feel so close
to you all.

890
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:18,048
I feel like I can
tell you something

891
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,717
that I haven't told
anyone at all.

892
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,921
But you have to promise
it stays in this room.

893
00:56:23,955 --> 00:56:26,757
In my early days...

894
00:56:26,791 --> 00:56:29,359
before sound
was invented...

895
00:56:30,827 --> 00:56:34,430
Well, I look pretty good
for 35, don't I?

896
00:56:42,106 --> 00:56:43,506
Well, anyway,

897
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,342
back then,
classical piano players

898
00:56:46,377 --> 00:56:48,577
always wore
black tuxedos.

899
00:56:48,612 --> 00:56:51,781
Plain old
black tuxedos.

900
00:56:51,815 --> 00:56:55,351
My mother, she wanted me
to be classical...

901
00:56:55,386 --> 00:56:57,787
but I just couldn't stay
out of the saloons.

902
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:03,091
But I did have a concert
at the Hollywood Bowl...

903
00:57:03,126 --> 00:57:05,493
and I was excited.

904
00:57:05,528 --> 00:57:07,095
If you've never
been there,

905
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:09,531
it's open air--
it's tremendous!

906
00:57:09,565 --> 00:57:12,467
It's got 10,000 people!

907
00:57:12,501 --> 00:57:15,703
I show up
for the rehearsal,

908
00:57:15,738 --> 00:57:18,973
and I look at this vast...
this beautiful,

909
00:57:19,007 --> 00:57:22,543
enormous
open-air theater.

910
00:57:22,577 --> 00:57:26,880
And I look
at the black piano.

911
00:57:26,915 --> 00:57:29,250
I think,
"Hmm."

912
00:57:29,284 --> 00:57:33,453
"Black piano,
black tuxedo."

913
00:57:33,487 --> 00:57:37,458
"Who is going to see me
in this giant clam shell?"

914
00:57:39,527 --> 00:57:42,863
Well, I ask you...
can you see me now?

915
00:58:27,072 --> 00:58:28,773
<i>All I'm saying is..</i>

916
00:58:28,808 --> 00:58:30,142
why can't we have fun?

917
00:58:30,176 --> 00:58:32,277
- Kvetch, kvetch, kvetch!
- See people, you know?

918
00:58:32,312 --> 00:58:36,147
Go to a party
every once in a while.

919
00:58:36,181 --> 00:58:37,882
- All I do is give, give, give!
- Maybe see somebody.

920
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:39,984
And no matter how much I buy
you, it's never enough!

921
00:58:40,019 --> 00:58:43,087
I'm not asking you
to buy me anything, Lee.

922
00:58:43,122 --> 00:58:46,190
I'm just-- I'm crawling the
walls a little, that's all.

923
00:58:46,225 --> 00:58:48,159
Why can't we
see people?

924
00:58:48,193 --> 00:58:49,860
What are you
talking about?

925
00:58:49,895 --> 00:58:52,195
I took you to the Jim Nabors-
Dom DeLuise concert.

926
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:55,932
That was...
that was one time.

927
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:58,235
Scott, I'm tired.
I work all night.

928
00:58:58,269 --> 00:59:00,137
- This is not an inexpensive life.
- I know,

929
00:59:00,171 --> 00:59:02,239
but you don't even
let me go out by myself!

930
00:59:02,273 --> 00:59:04,141
- Why?
- I don't know!

931
00:59:04,175 --> 00:59:07,544
Just to go out
and see people

932
00:59:07,578 --> 00:59:10,746
and talk to them.
Just for a break!

933
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,314
A break from me?

934
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:13,782
Why do you need
a break from me?

935
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:14,917
I don't need
a break from--

936
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:16,018
I mean for you
to come with me!

937
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,453
I can't say
anything right.

938
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:19,288
Please don't
be unhappy.

939
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:21,691
I can't stand it when you
have a face like that.

940
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,360
Especially after
the money I paid for it.

941
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:25,261
Oh, you
want it back?

942
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:27,196
You want me to invite Charo
for brunch again?

943
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,865
- You liked her.
- Yeah, I like her fine, but--

944
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:33,202
But what?! What is it with you?
It's never enough!

945
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,737
What more can I give?

946
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:37,473
I'm not--

947
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:42,110
I'm happy, okay?
I am.

948
00:59:42,144 --> 00:59:45,480
It's just... you have
to try to understand...

949
00:59:45,514 --> 00:59:47,348
being somebody's
boyfriend?

950
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:49,349
This is not
exactly the life

951
00:59:49,384 --> 00:59:52,252
that I had planned
for myself, you know?

952
00:59:52,287 --> 00:59:55,589
I mean, I was going to be
a veterinarian.

953
00:59:55,623 --> 00:59:57,891
You want to help
animals?

954
00:59:57,925 --> 01:00:01,095
Pick up the dog shit.

955
01:00:01,963 --> 01:00:03,430
And you listen
to me.

956
01:00:03,465 --> 01:00:05,498
You stop taking
those pills, okay?

957
01:00:05,532 --> 01:00:07,433
Jack gives you
too much.

958
01:00:07,468 --> 01:00:10,069
He's got some people
addicted, I hear.

959
01:00:10,104 --> 01:00:12,506
You're getting too thin,
you're always in a mood.

960
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:15,242
- People are noticing.
- Oh, who? Seymour?

961
01:00:15,276 --> 01:00:16,943
Seymour hates me.

962
01:00:16,978 --> 01:00:18,445
- They all hate me.
- See, this is what I mean.

963
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,646
It's that shit
talking!

964
01:00:28,522 --> 01:00:32,525
Hey, you know what a woman said
to me in the casino today?

965
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:35,894
She asked me
if I was Liberace's son.

966
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:41,433
<i>- Really?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

967
01:00:42,835 --> 01:00:44,569
Oh.

968
01:00:44,604 --> 01:00:47,105
- Come here.
- No.

969
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:48,573
Come here.
Come here.

970
01:00:48,608 --> 01:00:51,843
You don't get anything.
You get nothing.

971
01:00:53,077 --> 01:00:54,945
I get it all.

972
01:00:54,979 --> 01:00:57,080
- Yes, I do. Please.
- Can I ask you a question?

973
01:00:57,115 --> 01:00:58,782
- Yes.
- Can we go out?

974
01:00:58,816 --> 01:01:01,051
Oh...

975
01:01:05,158 --> 01:01:07,125
<i>Walter was a twin.</i>

976
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,859
Really?
He never told me.

977
01:01:08,893 --> 01:01:11,928
Yeah, but the twin
was born dead.

978
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:15,299
But Walter...

979
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:19,270
Walter,
he weighed 13 pounds.

980
01:01:21,673 --> 01:01:24,574
Even in the womb, he wanted
more than anyone else!

981
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:28,978
What's a mother to do?

982
01:01:29,012 --> 01:01:31,481
<i>She loves
the child more.</i>

983
01:01:31,515 --> 01:01:34,050
<i>Now the world must
give him what he needs.</i>

984
01:01:34,084 --> 01:01:35,785
Mm-hmm.

985
01:01:35,819 --> 01:01:40,056
God. God gives us
the power.

986
01:01:42,058 --> 01:01:44,125
It's not luck.

987
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,662
It's who you are.

988
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:50,932
- Oh!
- Whoa!

989
01:01:50,966 --> 01:01:52,668
I win, I win!

990
01:01:52,702 --> 01:01:55,805
I win, I win.
Look, look, look, I wi--

991
01:01:56,739 --> 01:01:58,574
<i>Lee?</i>

992
01:01:58,608 --> 01:02:00,442
Lee.

993
01:02:00,476 --> 01:02:02,277
- Lee.
- What? What is it?

994
01:02:02,312 --> 01:02:04,313
She won, but there's
no money in the machine.

995
01:02:04,347 --> 01:02:07,849
Oh, for chrissakes.

996
01:02:07,883 --> 01:02:09,751
I don't have any change.

997
01:02:09,785 --> 01:02:12,120
She won big.

998
01:02:12,154 --> 01:02:14,154
Do you have
anything?

999
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:15,856
Gladys, do you have
any cash on you?

1000
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:17,592
<i>So, Ma, this is all we have.</i>

1001
01:02:17,626 --> 01:02:19,694
But look
how much I won.

1002
01:02:19,728 --> 01:02:22,029
No, I know, but we don't
have any more cash.

1003
01:02:22,063 --> 01:02:24,031
But...

1004
01:02:24,065 --> 01:02:27,301
Okay. Okay.

1005
01:02:27,336 --> 01:02:30,403
So I'll take
a check.

1006
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,212
Are you
proposing to me?

1007
01:02:39,247 --> 01:02:43,850
I just don't have a lot of
ready cash available, so...

1008
01:02:43,884 --> 01:02:46,719
I can't go to Lee, 'cause he
doesn't want me taking it anymore.

1009
01:02:46,753 --> 01:02:48,255
Well, that's silly.

1010
01:02:48,289 --> 01:02:50,624
He wants you to stay
skinny, doesn't he?

1011
01:02:51,525 --> 01:02:52,859
Silly.

1012
01:02:52,893 --> 01:02:55,194
<i>I mean, I'd like to
wean myself off it...</i>

1013
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:57,130
<i>eventually,
but, uh...</i>

1014
01:02:57,164 --> 01:02:58,931
I have it under
manageable control now.

1015
01:02:58,966 --> 01:03:00,866
I don't even think
I'm going to take them

1016
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,601
<i>on the European tour.</i>

1017
01:03:02,636 --> 01:03:04,436
Totally up to you.

1018
01:03:04,471 --> 01:03:06,338
The body flushes it out.

1019
01:03:06,373 --> 01:03:08,707
There are no studies
that show it's addicting.

1020
01:03:08,742 --> 01:03:10,776
It's perfectly fine.

1021
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:12,745
You look terrific,
by the way.

1022
01:03:16,315 --> 01:03:18,149
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1023
01:03:18,183 --> 01:03:19,751
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1024
01:03:19,785 --> 01:03:21,986
<i>How does he get that
whole thing down his throat?</i>

1025
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:24,522
<i>It's bigger than his head!</i>

1026
01:03:24,556 --> 01:03:26,524
<i>It's a freak show!</i>

1027
01:03:26,558 --> 01:03:29,661
<i>I don't know how you
can be gay and be such a prude.</i>

1028
01:03:29,695 --> 01:03:32,496
<i>I'm bisexual.</i>

1029
01:03:33,698 --> 01:03:35,299
Well, which half
likes women?

1030
01:03:35,333 --> 01:03:37,801
I haven't met
that half yet.

1031
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:40,537
You know, you're such
a booper.

1032
01:03:40,572 --> 01:03:44,375
Such a party
pooper-booper.

1033
01:03:44,409 --> 01:03:47,411
I don't even know
why you need that.

1034
01:03:47,445 --> 01:03:49,312
<i>I don't need it.</i>

1035
01:03:49,347 --> 01:03:52,416
I enjoy it.
It enhances it.

1036
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:56,219
Sexuality is
something beautiful.

1037
01:03:56,254 --> 01:03:57,520
Right.
So how can you watch

1038
01:03:57,554 --> 01:04:00,155
those disgusting things
being done?

1039
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:03,459
Disgusting is in the eyes
of the disgusting.

1040
01:04:03,494 --> 01:04:06,462
There's nothing wrong with
any part of the human body.

1041
01:04:06,497 --> 01:04:08,264
It's all
God's creation.

1042
01:04:08,298 --> 01:04:11,934
Well, God didn't make certain
parts for certain things.

1043
01:04:11,968 --> 01:04:13,535
It's variety, Scott.

1044
01:04:13,569 --> 01:04:15,437
It's what keeps
a relationship fresh.

1045
01:04:15,471 --> 01:04:18,172
You know, you are
such a prude!

1046
01:04:18,207 --> 01:04:19,574
I am not.

1047
01:04:19,609 --> 01:04:22,176
<i>Then why won't you let
me fuck you sometime?</i>

1048
01:04:26,115 --> 01:04:27,949
- Forget it.
- Why not?

1049
01:04:27,983 --> 01:04:30,083
- Because I don't like it.
- Why?

1050
01:04:30,118 --> 01:04:32,621
Because it's
kind of repugnant.

1051
01:04:33,723 --> 01:04:35,924
<i>I'm repugnant?</i>

1052
01:04:35,958 --> 01:04:37,859
No! Not you.

1053
01:04:37,894 --> 01:04:39,494
It.

1054
01:04:40,496 --> 01:04:42,263
That.
Doing that.

1055
01:04:43,265 --> 01:04:45,999
<i>Only when
it's done to you.</i>

1056
01:04:46,034 --> 01:04:47,301
Yes.

1057
01:04:47,335 --> 01:04:48,936
I can't help it.

1058
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:50,905
<i>- Well, you never tried it.
- Oh, God!</i>

1059
01:04:50,939 --> 01:04:53,273
Because I know
I wouldn't like it.

1060
01:04:53,308 --> 01:04:55,409
If you loved me,
you'd try it.

1061
01:04:55,444 --> 01:04:58,245
If you loved me, you wouldn't
ask me to do something I hate.

1062
01:04:58,279 --> 01:04:59,513
Oh, God!

1063
01:04:59,548 --> 01:05:00,980
All of a sudden
we're sounding like

1064
01:05:01,014 --> 01:05:03,115
a gay Lucy and Ricky.

1065
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:05,251
"Oh, Ricky, you wouldn't
fuck me up the ass

1066
01:05:05,285 --> 01:05:06,686
<i>if you really loved me."</i>

1067
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,321
Why am I the Lucy?

1068
01:05:08,355 --> 01:05:11,257
Because I'm
the bandleader

1069
01:05:11,291 --> 01:05:13,526
with the nightclub act.

1070
01:05:22,736 --> 01:05:24,403
Hello.

1071
01:05:26,039 --> 01:05:27,640
Hold on.

1072
01:05:27,675 --> 01:05:29,876
It's your sister.

1073
01:05:32,712 --> 01:05:35,146
Angie, what?

1074
01:05:37,984 --> 01:05:40,085
When?

1075
01:05:41,287 --> 01:05:44,356
Okay.

1076
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:47,559
Did you call...
what's his name?

1077
01:05:49,394 --> 01:05:52,162
Okay. Okay.

1078
01:05:52,197 --> 01:05:55,833
All right, let me
call Seymour on this.

1079
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:58,503
It'll be first thing
in the morning.

1080
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:00,270
Yeah.

1081
01:06:00,305 --> 01:06:01,772
Okay.

1082
01:06:07,678 --> 01:06:10,346
Lee, what?

1083
01:06:12,216 --> 01:06:14,218
Mama died.

1084
01:06:14,252 --> 01:06:16,587
Oh, no.

1085
01:06:16,622 --> 01:06:18,589
Oh, no.

1086
01:06:19,491 --> 01:06:21,892
Oh, Lee,
I'm so sorry.

1087
01:06:59,461 --> 01:07:03,565
You have been amazing
these past few days.

1088
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:05,266
We haven't even had
a chance to talk.

1089
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:07,302
How are you
feeling?

1090
01:07:10,039 --> 01:07:12,073
I'm free.

1091
01:07:19,448 --> 01:07:21,315
<i>You're going to love this.</i>

1092
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:24,185
- Mm-mm.
- Come on. Just this one time.

1093
01:07:24,219 --> 01:07:25,586
No, I don't
want to.

1094
01:07:27,388 --> 01:07:29,790
Pooch, pooch, pooch, come on.
Ride my little scooter!

1095
01:07:29,824 --> 01:07:31,625
You can ride my little scooter!

1096
01:07:31,659 --> 01:07:34,427
- Don't tickle me.
- Let's see.

1097
01:07:34,462 --> 01:07:35,762
Oh, daddy!

1098
01:08:13,666 --> 01:08:15,667
Lee?

1099
01:08:26,512 --> 01:08:28,913
Lee?

1100
01:08:33,552 --> 01:08:35,653
Lee?

1101
01:08:35,687 --> 01:08:38,656
<i>Someone's in here!
What the fuck?!</i>

1102
01:09:00,812 --> 01:09:03,747
What are you doing?

1103
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:33,375
Why was I on
the couch?

1104
01:09:33,376 --> 01:09:36,845
Because I couldn't
bear you last night.

1105
01:09:36,879 --> 01:09:38,346
And if you keep
taking that junk,

1106
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:40,182
you'll be lucky to stay
on the couch.

1107
01:09:40,216 --> 01:09:43,352
Well, about last night--
I'm not ready for apologies yet, okay.

1108
01:09:43,386 --> 01:09:45,722
Apology?
Fuck you!

1109
01:09:47,657 --> 01:09:50,558
You are
a well-known star.

1110
01:09:50,593 --> 01:09:52,560
Are you out
of your mind?

1111
01:09:52,595 --> 01:09:55,097
Going to a place
like that?

1112
01:09:55,131 --> 01:09:57,766
What if somebody
recognized you...

1113
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,201
and called the papers?

1114
01:09:59,235 --> 01:10:00,535
I mean, Jesus!

1115
01:10:00,569 --> 01:10:02,204
When the London papers
said I was gay,

1116
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:04,940
I took them to court
and won the lawsuit.

1117
01:10:04,974 --> 01:10:07,341
They retracted the story
and they paid for it.

1118
01:10:07,375 --> 01:10:08,909
Only because
they didn't have

1119
01:10:08,944 --> 01:10:11,478
a witness of you
in a room of dildos...

1120
01:10:11,512 --> 01:10:13,547
with your dick hanging out
in a glory hole.

1121
01:10:13,581 --> 01:10:16,516
Are you out
of your fucking mind?!

1122
01:10:16,551 --> 01:10:19,720
Jesus, if Seymour
found out.

1123
01:10:19,755 --> 01:10:22,288
<i>I mean,
the millions he spends...</i>

1124
01:10:22,322 --> 01:10:26,960
<i>keeping fans thinking you just
haven't met the right woman?</i>

1125
01:10:26,994 --> 01:10:28,728
Oh, Scott,
you're right.

1126
01:10:28,763 --> 01:10:31,497
You're so right--
I got to stop.

1127
01:10:31,531 --> 01:10:34,301
Never again,
I promise, never again.

1128
01:10:34,335 --> 01:10:38,104
I swear to God.

1129
01:10:38,139 --> 01:10:40,006
You're so good for me.

1130
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,674
I don't know
what it is.

1131
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:43,542
I can't stop myself
sometimes.

1132
01:10:43,577 --> 01:10:46,379
It's like a drug...
you know?

1133
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:50,015
Like when you need
a stronger fix each time?

1134
01:10:51,317 --> 01:10:53,418
You have to help me.

1135
01:10:55,121 --> 01:10:57,956
I'll do
whatever you want...

1136
01:10:57,991 --> 01:10:59,457
you crazy
old queen.

1137
01:11:01,294 --> 01:11:03,294
You know that.

1138
01:11:03,328 --> 01:11:05,897
Just keep loving me.

1139
01:11:08,633 --> 01:11:12,303
But I want you to stop
seeing Dr. Startz.

1140
01:11:12,337 --> 01:11:14,638
<i>I mean it.</i>

1141
01:11:35,226 --> 01:11:37,694
- The entrance? Showstopper.
- Thank you.

1142
01:11:37,728 --> 01:11:39,162
Hello!

1143
01:11:39,197 --> 01:11:40,964
Finally, you come
to one of my shows.

1144
01:11:40,998 --> 01:11:43,233
No, I was here last year, remember?

1145
01:11:43,267 --> 01:11:45,202
So, this is new,
right?

1146
01:11:45,236 --> 01:11:47,103
I have new costumes
every year--

1147
01:11:47,138 --> 01:11:49,272
it's in my contract.
You like it?

1148
01:11:49,307 --> 01:11:50,740
You did it again.

1149
01:11:50,774 --> 01:11:52,441
It just gets bigger
and bigger, right?

1150
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:55,344
One day, Lee, I think you're going
to play the piano while you fly.

1151
01:11:55,378 --> 01:11:57,012
Ray's working
on that.

1152
01:11:57,047 --> 01:11:59,315
- Scott, why don't you get him a drink?
- You heard the maestro.

1153
01:11:59,349 --> 01:12:01,350
<i>- Do your thing, Lee.
- Bonjour!</i>

1154
01:12:01,384 --> 01:12:04,320
<i>You guys, how did you
like the pool?</i>

1155
01:12:04,354 --> 01:12:06,121
What would you like?

1156
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:08,823
The money you owe me from last
time and a Jim Beam neat.

1157
01:12:08,858 --> 01:12:10,758
I don't have
any cash right now.

1158
01:12:10,792 --> 01:12:13,928
<i>- Did you wear your little Speedos?
- I did.</i>

1159
01:12:13,963 --> 01:12:16,465
I'll accept
whatever's handy, guy.

1160
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:19,935
<i>Did you notice
the "L" on the front?</i>

1161
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:22,304
It was missing an "A" on the back.

1162
01:12:22,339 --> 01:12:23,571
You're cute.

1163
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:25,206
<i>- You are very cute.
- Stop.</i>

1164
01:12:25,241 --> 01:12:26,807
<i>I like that.</i>

1165
01:12:55,869 --> 01:12:58,670
<i>So, how is
the songwriting going?</i>

1166
01:12:58,705 --> 01:13:00,639
Good.

1167
01:13:00,673 --> 01:13:03,209
I had some
positive feedback.

1168
01:13:03,243 --> 01:13:05,444
When are you going to let me
hear one of your songs?

1169
01:13:05,478 --> 01:13:07,947
- I don't know.
- Why?

1170
01:13:07,981 --> 01:13:10,350
'Cause I'm afraid
you wouldn't like it.

1171
01:13:10,385 --> 01:13:12,318
But I'm proud
of what you're doing!

1172
01:13:12,352 --> 01:13:13,953
I'm like a proud papa!

1173
01:13:13,987 --> 01:13:17,823
I think it's great!

1174
01:13:17,857 --> 01:13:19,926
Maybe when I'm done with
this one, you can hear it.

1175
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,261
Whenever you want me
to hear.

1176
01:13:34,273 --> 01:13:36,675
Scott, we should talk.

1177
01:13:38,912 --> 01:13:40,479
I think
our relationship

1178
01:13:40,513 --> 01:13:42,915
is in a really
good place, don't you?

1179
01:13:42,949 --> 01:13:45,883
- Mm-hmm.
- I do.

1180
01:13:45,918 --> 01:13:48,953
So I think it'd be
a good thing for us...

1181
01:13:48,987 --> 01:13:51,722
if we were able to see
other people, too.

1182
01:13:51,757 --> 01:13:53,958
I don't mean
like you and me.

1183
01:13:53,992 --> 01:13:57,528
I mean, nothing
will ever be like us.

1184
01:13:57,563 --> 01:14:00,965
I just know there are things that
I like to do that you don't...

1185
01:14:00,999 --> 01:14:03,668
and things that you like
to do that I don't.

1186
01:14:03,702 --> 01:14:06,370
And I just think that
we're in such a good place

1187
01:14:06,404 --> 01:14:10,508
that we can allow each other...
you know, to do that

1188
01:14:10,542 --> 01:14:15,179
and still love each other
and stay together.

1189
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:18,849
What do you think?

1190
01:14:20,451 --> 01:14:23,854
Okay. You know,
if that's what you want.

1191
01:14:25,356 --> 01:14:27,390
I think it'd be
good for us.

1192
01:14:27,424 --> 01:14:29,693
I really do.

1193
01:14:29,727 --> 01:14:32,895
Lee, he is
just a friend!

1194
01:14:32,929 --> 01:14:34,597
He is helping me
with my songs!

1195
01:14:34,631 --> 01:14:36,164
I told you I had
meetings with him!

1196
01:14:36,199 --> 01:14:37,399
You're just like
the rest of them.

1197
01:14:37,433 --> 01:14:39,668
All I do is give
and give and give.

1198
01:14:39,703 --> 01:14:42,104
All you want is what
you can get out of me.

1199
01:14:42,138 --> 01:14:44,039
I bet you can't
wait for me to die

1200
01:14:44,073 --> 01:14:45,407
so you can
get everything!

1201
01:14:45,441 --> 01:14:48,242
<i>- Hey, the will was your idea!
- Jekyll and Hyde!</i>

1202
01:14:48,276 --> 01:14:49,577
That's what you are!

1203
01:14:49,612 --> 01:14:51,780
I never know
who's going to show up!

1204
01:14:51,815 --> 01:14:54,182
God knows what you do
when I'm onstage.

1205
01:14:54,217 --> 01:14:56,719
<i>- I don't do anything!
- How many others are there, huh?</i>

1206
01:14:56,753 --> 01:14:59,755
<i>- How many?!
- There aren't any others, Lee, I'm telling you!</i>

1207
01:14:59,789 --> 01:15:03,091
<i>Well, I'm telling you,
you can't have it all.</i>

1208
01:15:03,126 --> 01:15:05,927
It's either me
or nothing.

1209
01:15:05,961 --> 01:15:07,962
Me or him.

1210
01:15:07,997 --> 01:15:10,732
Who?
He's a friend!

1211
01:15:10,766 --> 01:15:12,466
He's a fuck buddy!

1212
01:15:12,501 --> 01:15:16,070
If anybody's
fucking around, it's you.

1213
01:15:16,104 --> 01:15:19,106
I know you, Lee. You haven't
wanted it from me in weeks.

1214
01:15:19,141 --> 01:15:20,807
<i>Don't tell me
you've been doing without,</i>

1215
01:15:20,842 --> 01:15:22,743
you old queen.

1216
01:15:26,213 --> 01:15:29,950
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

1217
01:15:39,526 --> 01:15:41,727
<i>...people out here, and
it seems a bit out of control.</i>

1218
01:15:41,762 --> 01:15:44,031
Where's Lee?

1219
01:15:44,065 --> 01:15:45,632
Have a couple of guys
come help with security,

1220
01:15:45,667 --> 01:15:48,168
<i>wait on the stairs at night,
just to stop the crowds.</i>

1221
01:15:48,202 --> 01:15:51,572

1238
01:16:56,434 --> 01:16:59,202
to be on the Academy Awards,
and finally I am.

1239
01:16:59,237 --> 01:17:00,703
Isn't that fabulous?

1240
01:17:00,738 --> 01:17:03,072
I'm going to play a medley
of the nominated scores

1241
01:17:03,107 --> 01:17:06,109
and then present
the award for Best Score.

1242
01:17:06,144 --> 01:17:09,613
Just to be able to hold one
of those gold statues.

1243
01:17:09,647 --> 01:17:12,081
I know exactly
what I'm going to wear.

1244
01:17:12,116 --> 01:17:14,183
Cary, do me a favor.
Can you get me a towel?

1245
01:17:14,217 --> 01:17:15,851
Of course,
of course.

1246
01:17:15,885 --> 01:17:19,087
I want to hear about that
outfit when I come back.

1247
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:54,088
Who are you
talking to, Mumbles?

1248
01:17:57,759 --> 01:17:59,860
Nobody.

1249
01:18:03,264 --> 01:18:05,365
What's the matter?

1250
01:18:08,303 --> 01:18:11,037
Why is he always
hanging around?

1251
01:18:11,906 --> 01:18:14,675
Who?

1252
01:18:14,709 --> 01:18:17,076
<i>Who?</i>

1253
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:19,546
Who?

1254
01:18:20,881 --> 01:18:23,016
That boy that
you want to fuck

1255
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:25,485
<i>from Young Americans.</i>

1256
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,387
Oh, please.

1257
01:18:27,422 --> 01:18:28,589
Oh, please.

1258
01:18:28,623 --> 01:18:31,491
Why is that little bitch
always in our dressing room?

1259
01:18:32,759 --> 01:18:36,095
Cary is my opening act,
Scott.

1260
01:18:36,129 --> 01:18:39,265
He can come and go
as he pleases.

1261
01:18:43,437 --> 01:18:45,070
Are you fucking him?

1262
01:18:47,708 --> 01:18:49,173
Are you stoned?

1263
01:18:49,208 --> 01:18:51,008
No, I'm upset!

1264
01:18:51,043 --> 01:18:52,444
Can't you tell
the difference?

1265
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:54,846
No, I can't. But if
you're on that shit--

1266
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,681
<i>- I'm warning you...
- I'm not! I'm upset!</i>

1267
01:18:56,716 --> 01:18:58,717
- I will not put up with this anymore.
- Don't change the subject!

1268
01:18:58,751 --> 01:19:00,452
<i>- Stop that! Stop it!
- I know you, Lee!</i>

1269
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:02,887
<i>I'm exhausted!</i>

1270
01:19:04,422 --> 01:19:06,890
I work, you know?

1271
01:19:06,924 --> 01:19:09,360
And I have to meet Seymour
very early in the morning

1272
01:19:09,394 --> 01:19:12,297
about the Academy Awards
presentation.

1273
01:19:17,403 --> 01:19:20,471
I see you
looking at him.

1274
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:22,439
<i>What?</i>

1275
01:19:22,474 --> 01:19:25,242
That boy.

1276
01:19:25,277 --> 01:19:26,877
I watch you watch him.

1277
01:19:26,911 --> 01:19:29,713
I think he's
very talented.

1278
01:19:29,748 --> 01:19:32,048
I have an eye for new
and refreshing talent.

1279
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:34,184
You have an eye for new
and refreshing dick.

1280
01:19:34,218 --> 01:19:36,586
You're disgusting.

1281
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:39,155
<i>If you're so interested
in talent...</i>

1282
01:19:39,189 --> 01:19:42,759
<i>have you listened
to my songs?</i>

1283
01:19:42,793 --> 01:19:46,562
I haven't had a chance
to give it my full attention.

1284
01:19:47,765 --> 01:19:50,032
<i>Are you
tired of me?</i>

1285
01:19:50,066 --> 01:19:52,234
<i>Am I too old
for you?</i>

1286
01:19:52,269 --> 01:19:53,669
Well, this song
you're singing

1287
01:19:53,703 --> 01:19:56,037
is beginning to get
a little old.

1288
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:04,146
I don't want him around
after the shows anymore.

1289
01:20:04,181 --> 01:20:06,416
What a little brat
you've become.

1290
01:20:06,450 --> 01:20:08,530
I thought you liked being
around people your own age.

1291
01:20:08,551 --> 01:20:10,919
You're always complaining we're
never with anyone else, you know?

1292
01:20:10,953 --> 01:20:13,254
<i>You said we weren't doing the "seeing
other people" thing anymore!</i>

1293
01:20:13,289 --> 01:20:16,591
- We're not!
- Then how come we haven't been together for so long?

1294
01:20:16,626 --> 01:20:19,761
Because you're always stoned
and you can't get it up!

1295
01:20:19,796 --> 01:20:20,995
I can get it up!

1296
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:22,864
- Oh, Christ, I hit a nerve.
- I can get it up!!!

1297
01:20:22,898 --> 01:20:25,399
- All right, all right!
- I know you!

1298
01:20:25,434 --> 01:20:28,302
You can barely make it through a
performance without wanting to fuck!

1299
01:20:28,337 --> 01:20:30,170
- Where do you get it?
- It's terrible the way you talk to me!

1300
01:20:30,205 --> 01:20:31,305
You're getting it
on the outside!

1301
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:32,740
- Where do you go?
- You're terrible!

1302
01:20:32,774 --> 01:20:34,475
- Do you go to the White House?
- Where my mother died?

1303
01:20:34,509 --> 01:20:36,844
- Are you insane?
- Oh, so you do go somewhere.

1304
01:20:36,878 --> 01:20:38,512
Where, huh?

1305
01:20:38,547 --> 01:20:40,880
Where, Lee?!

1306
01:20:40,914 --> 01:20:43,182
You're being
paranoid, Scott,

1307
01:20:43,217 --> 01:20:44,884
because of that shit.

1308
01:20:44,918 --> 01:20:48,487
Now, I am warning you...
this better stop.

1309
01:20:53,092 --> 01:20:55,362
<i>So who's doing the
arrangements for the medley?</i>

1310
01:20:55,396 --> 01:20:59,232
I'll find out. Probably
Bill or his assistant.

1311
01:20:59,266 --> 01:21:01,735
I bet that Vangelis kid
wins, you know?

1312
01:21:01,769 --> 01:21:04,002
I'm hearing him
all over the radio.

1313
01:21:18,485 --> 01:21:20,918
I'm going to L.A.
for the afternoon.

1314
01:21:26,324 --> 01:21:29,360
I'll be back in time
for the show.

1315
01:21:38,636 --> 01:21:42,272
I just want to make sure I
have enough rehearsal time.

1316
01:22:04,896 --> 01:22:07,096
And now he's going to use me,

1317
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:08,731
use me up
and toss me out,

1318
01:22:08,765 --> 01:22:11,667
I know he is,
I know he is.

1319
01:22:11,701 --> 01:22:13,135
<i>This one's rigged.</i>

1320
01:22:13,169 --> 01:22:15,871
<i>- I love him, you know?
- That one's not rigged.</i>

1321
01:22:15,906 --> 01:22:17,473
I love him.

1322
01:22:17,507 --> 01:22:19,708
I mean...

1323
01:22:19,743 --> 01:22:22,578
he's been my whole world.

1324
01:22:23,846 --> 01:22:26,581
He's my,
he's my best friend.

1325
01:22:26,615 --> 01:22:29,317
He's been better,
better than a father.

1326
01:22:30,486 --> 01:22:31,753
He was going to adopt me.
You know that?

1327
01:22:31,787 --> 01:22:33,488
<i>Really? You can adopt
someone you're fucking?</i>

1328
01:22:33,522 --> 01:22:35,156
<i>That's a great law.</i>

1329
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:36,491
He said he always wanted
to make sure

1330
01:22:36,525 --> 01:22:38,928
<i>- that I was taken care of.
- Right.</i>

1331
01:22:38,962 --> 01:22:41,095
<i>Look, you're practically
married, right?</i>

1332
01:22:41,129 --> 01:22:43,798
Nobody ever took care of me
the way he did.

1333
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:47,836
I have nothing
without him.

1334
01:22:47,870 --> 01:22:49,537
I don't even have
my own fucking face!

1335
01:22:49,572 --> 01:22:51,439
My fucking face
is fucking gone

1336
01:22:51,474 --> 01:22:52,774
for-fucking-ever, man!!

1337
01:22:52,808 --> 01:22:55,576
<i>Hey, hey, hey.
Tranquilo, okay?</i>

1338
01:22:55,610 --> 01:22:57,310
<i>Calm down.</i>

1339
01:22:57,345 --> 01:22:59,746
<i>Look at me. You're
practically married, right?</i>

1340
01:22:59,781 --> 01:23:01,247
<i>So, he should
take care of you</i>

1341
01:23:01,282 --> 01:23:03,049
<i>in the style to which
you are accustomed.</i>

1342
01:23:03,084 --> 01:23:04,284
<i>That's a law, too.</i>

1343
01:23:04,318 --> 01:23:06,052
I'm in the will,
but...

1344
01:23:06,087 --> 01:23:08,321
a lot of good
that does me now.

1345
01:23:08,356 --> 01:23:10,491
<i>Being with him's like
a full-time job, correct?</i>

1346
01:23:10,525 --> 01:23:13,926
<i>- 25 hours a day.
- Yeah. So three words:</i>

1347
01:23:13,961 --> 01:23:15,427
<i>Sev-er-ance,
all right?</i>

1348
01:23:15,462 --> 01:23:18,197
<i>People who get fired
get compensated.</i>

1349
01:23:25,105 --> 01:23:28,039
He's my whole world.

1350
01:24:03,975 --> 01:24:05,442
There you are,

1351
01:24:05,476 --> 01:24:09,947
you cocksucking
tenor fuck.

1352
01:24:13,217 --> 01:24:15,019
There's a call
for you.

1353
01:24:15,053 --> 01:24:17,219
Joe Carracappa.

1354
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:26,463
<i>- Joe!
- Hey, Scott.</i>

1355
01:24:26,497 --> 01:24:27,657
Hey, I'm sorry,
I have to run.

1356
01:24:27,666 --> 01:24:29,033
I have to make
an entrance.

1357
01:24:29,067 --> 01:24:32,635
Rose... passed away
this morning, Scott.

1358
01:24:34,972 --> 01:24:36,505
What?

1359
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:40,777
<i>- She's been sick.
- For how long?</i>

1360
01:24:40,811 --> 01:24:42,311
A while.

1361
01:24:42,345 --> 01:24:44,413
She never said
anything to me.

1362
01:24:44,448 --> 01:24:48,116
<i>You know
how she is.</i>

1363
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:50,786
Was.

1364
01:24:52,855 --> 01:24:55,123
Can you come home, Scott?
It'd be good to see you.

1365
01:24:55,157 --> 01:24:58,493
<i>We're having
services.</i>

1366
01:25:01,330 --> 01:25:03,631
Yeah.

1367
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:05,967
Yeah, of course.

1368
01:25:06,001 --> 01:25:07,534
<i>I am so excited.</i>

1369
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:10,471
The Academy Awards
has been a dream of mine.

1370
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:13,008
That and Radio City
Music Hall.

1371
01:25:13,042 --> 01:25:14,876
One down, one to go.

1372
01:25:16,378 --> 01:25:18,346
My mom wants "On Golden
Pond" to win everything.

1373
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:19,847
Yes, wouldn't
that be sweet

1374
01:25:19,881 --> 01:25:21,548
for the old folks
to win?

1375
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:25,886
And I'm so glad that Jane Fonda
stopped all those causes of hers

1376
01:25:25,921 --> 01:25:28,889
and made a nice movie
with her father.

1377
01:25:28,924 --> 01:25:32,159
I just don't understand
people like her and Ed Asner,

1378
01:25:32,193 --> 01:25:35,929
shouting their opinions
all over the place.

1379
01:25:35,963 --> 01:25:39,733
Listen to me, because
you're all on your way.

1380
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:42,268
When one reaches
star status,

1381
01:25:42,302 --> 01:25:44,971
it is not an invitation
to show everyone

1382
01:25:45,006 --> 01:25:46,940
how to change
the world.

1383
01:25:46,974 --> 01:25:50,844
It is not our business
to change the world.

1384
01:25:50,878 --> 01:25:53,545
We are here to
entertain the world...

1385
01:25:53,579 --> 01:25:56,915
and to sell drinks and souvenirs.

1386
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:59,084
These kids better go
get ready for the next show

1387
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:00,853
if they're going to
entertain anybody.

1388
01:26:00,887 --> 01:26:02,554
Will you watch us tonight?

1389
01:26:02,588 --> 01:26:03,989
We put a new song in
just for you.

1390
01:26:04,024 --> 01:26:07,393
<i>Of course I will! Especially if
you put in a new song for me.</i>

1391
01:26:07,427 --> 01:26:09,227
Go on now.

1392
01:26:09,262 --> 01:26:11,496
I'm going to get
my beauty nap.

1393
01:26:24,076 --> 01:26:27,645
- Lee.
- Please, do not start an argument.

1394
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:30,648
I have to eat, and take
my nap before the next show.

1395
01:26:30,683 --> 01:26:32,917
I have no time.

1396
01:26:41,726 --> 01:26:43,593
I got a call today...

1397
01:26:43,627 --> 01:26:47,497
from Joe Carracappa.

1398
01:26:48,733 --> 01:26:52,502
The family that I lived
with when I met you.

1399
01:26:54,305 --> 01:26:56,740
And Rose...

1400
01:26:56,774 --> 01:26:59,309
my--

1401
01:26:59,343 --> 01:27:02,378
Joe's wife.

1402
01:27:02,413 --> 01:27:04,247
She died.

1403
01:27:08,552 --> 01:27:11,254
Oh, Scott,
I...

1404
01:27:11,288 --> 01:27:13,089
I'm so sorry,
Scott.

1405
01:27:13,123 --> 01:27:17,559
She was your favorite,
wasn't she?

1406
01:27:17,594 --> 01:27:22,564
There is a funeral
tomorrow... in Los Angeles.

1407
01:27:22,599 --> 01:27:24,633
I will be booking
a ticket in the morning.

1408
01:27:24,667 --> 01:27:27,636
- No, no, no, no.
- I don't know what time I'm going to get back.

1409
01:27:27,670 --> 01:27:30,171
I'll call Seymour
in the morning, okay?

1410
01:27:30,206 --> 01:27:34,642
And I'll hire a Learjet
and you can take that.

1411
01:27:34,676 --> 01:27:37,045
And this way
it'll be more private

1412
01:27:37,079 --> 01:27:40,648
and you won't have to worry
about reservations.

1413
01:27:40,682 --> 01:27:45,385
You come back any time
that you're ready tomorrow.

1414
01:27:51,026 --> 01:27:53,194
Come on, now.

1415
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:01,902
It's just been so long since
we've been nice to each other...

1416
01:28:01,936 --> 01:28:05,139
and I was forgetting
what it felt like.

1417
01:28:08,376 --> 01:28:13,046
Well, let's just keep being
nice to each other, hmm?

1418
01:28:13,081 --> 01:28:15,048
How about that?

1419
01:28:51,483 --> 01:28:53,484
Hi, Gladys.

1420
01:28:57,089 --> 01:28:59,557
<i>- Hey.
- Hey, kid.</i>

1421
01:28:59,591 --> 01:29:01,059
I didn't know
you were visiting.

1422
01:29:01,093 --> 01:29:03,328
Lee invited me for the day.
I heard about Rose.

1423
01:29:03,362 --> 01:29:04,728
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

1424
01:29:04,762 --> 01:29:06,864
Thanks.

1425
01:29:06,898 --> 01:29:08,966
Where's Lee?

1426
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,969
He has his final fitting
for the Oscars.

1427
01:29:12,003 --> 01:29:15,439
Come out by the pool
when you've settled in.

1428
01:29:16,308 --> 01:29:18,042
Hey, Bob?

1429
01:29:19,244 --> 01:29:21,811
- What's going on?
- What?

1430
01:29:21,846 --> 01:29:24,747
It just
feels weird.

1431
01:29:24,781 --> 01:29:27,016
Is there something
I don't know about?

1432
01:29:30,454 --> 01:29:32,456
Well...

1433
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:37,026
yeah.

1434
01:29:37,061 --> 01:29:39,963
Yeah.

1435
01:29:39,997 --> 01:29:44,300
Last night... you know,
the kid that he... Right?

1436
01:29:47,104 --> 01:29:49,105
Cary, I think his...

1437
01:30:58,939 --> 01:31:01,673
We should move you to the Palm
Springs house this afternoon.

1438
01:31:03,476 --> 01:31:05,709
Let's wait
in the den.

1439
01:31:30,302 --> 01:31:33,037
- I'm not calling him.
- So don't.

1440
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:37,507
I mean,
he's in the wrong.

1441
01:31:37,541 --> 01:31:39,943
<i>He should call me
and apologize to me.</i>

1442
01:31:39,978 --> 01:31:41,744
<i>He fooled around
on you.</i>

1443
01:31:41,779 --> 01:31:43,480
I mean, who's the injured
party here, guy?

1444
01:31:45,049 --> 01:31:47,217
I'm not calling him.

1445
01:31:47,251 --> 01:31:48,885
So if his phone
doesn't ring,

1446
01:31:48,919 --> 01:31:50,387
it's probably you.

1447
01:31:50,421 --> 01:31:52,054
It's the only way
men learn.

1448
01:31:52,089 --> 01:31:53,689
Tell me.

1449
01:31:54,958 --> 01:31:58,094
<i>- I am not calling him.
- So don't.</i>

1450
01:31:58,128 --> 01:32:01,364
You scumbag,
piece of shit...

1451
01:32:01,398 --> 01:32:03,765
fairy, fucking queen
cocksucker!

1452
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,801
<i>- That's what I'm talking about!
- How dare you!</i>

1453
01:32:05,835 --> 01:32:08,437
<i>- Fucking A!
- How fucking dare you, Lee! I could kill you!</i>

1454
01:32:08,472 --> 01:32:11,374
<i>- I could fucking kill you!
- Yeah, put that in your pipe and smoke it, baby.</i>

1455
01:32:14,044 --> 01:32:15,878
He hung up.

1456
01:32:15,912 --> 01:32:17,313
Whoo!

1457
01:32:17,347 --> 01:32:19,915
Oh.

1458
01:32:23,553 --> 01:32:25,453
Mr. Schnelker.

1459
01:32:25,488 --> 01:32:27,722
This is Scott Thorson's
brother, Wayne.

1460
01:32:27,756 --> 01:32:29,224
<i>Half-brother.</i>

1461
01:32:29,258 --> 01:32:30,925
He's here
to help us.

1462
01:32:30,959 --> 01:32:32,727
Now as I said
on the phone,

1463
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:34,762
Lee wants you to inform
Mr. Scott Thorson

1464
01:32:34,796 --> 01:32:36,464
his employment
has been terminated

1465
01:32:36,499 --> 01:32:39,134
and he must vacate
the apartment immediately.

1466
01:32:39,168 --> 01:32:40,934
Also, if possible,

1467
01:32:40,968 --> 01:32:42,936
we'd like you to convince
Scott to admit himself

1468
01:32:42,970 --> 01:32:44,838
to a hospital
for treatment,

1469
01:32:44,872 --> 01:32:46,473
at our expense.

1470
01:32:46,508 --> 01:32:47,674
<i>Dorothy, June.</i>

1471
01:32:47,708 --> 01:32:50,344
Mr. Heller.
He's on the couch.

1472
01:32:50,378 --> 01:32:52,746
Stay by the elevator.
Wayne?

1473
01:32:55,683 --> 01:32:57,450
Scott?

1474
01:32:59,454 --> 01:33:00,921
Scott?

1475
01:33:02,924 --> 01:33:05,492
Scott?

1476
01:33:05,527 --> 01:33:07,594
This is Tracy.

1477
01:33:07,628 --> 01:33:09,430
A private investigator.

1478
01:33:09,464 --> 01:33:12,032
He's come
to ask you to leave.

1479
01:33:14,568 --> 01:33:16,869
Get out of my house!

1480
01:33:16,903 --> 01:33:19,004
Get out of my house!

1481
01:33:19,039 --> 01:33:22,675
<i>- I only came to help.
- I'm going to fucking get you out.</i>

1482
01:33:30,483 --> 01:33:32,617
- He's going to get a gun!
- Has he got a gun?

1483
01:33:32,651 --> 01:33:35,420
- He has two.
- Don't let him get the guns.

1484
01:33:35,455 --> 01:33:37,089
Let's go, brother.

1485
01:33:40,259 --> 01:33:41,859
Stay back!

1486
01:33:41,894 --> 01:33:43,562
Stay back,
don't you come in here!

1487
01:33:43,596 --> 01:33:46,564
I'm calling the police!
I'm calling the police!

1488
01:33:46,598 --> 01:33:48,732
- Back off!
- Fine.

1489
01:33:48,766 --> 01:33:51,103
I wish you would
call the police.

1490
01:33:51,137 --> 01:33:53,238
Scott, if you would take
advantage of our assistance,

1491
01:33:53,272 --> 01:33:56,007
I'd be happy to call a
doctor and we can help you.

1492
01:33:56,041 --> 01:33:58,210
Just fucking
shut up!

1493
01:33:58,244 --> 01:34:00,011
- Do you want me to help you?
- Shut up!

1494
01:34:00,045 --> 01:34:03,214
Back off!
I will fucking hit you!

1495
01:34:04,083 --> 01:34:05,617
Hello, hello?
Hello.

1496
01:34:05,651 --> 01:34:09,053
Yes,
I want the, uh...

1497
01:34:09,088 --> 01:34:11,122
<i>- I want the...
- Scott.</i>

1498
01:34:11,156 --> 01:34:13,491
<i>- Who the fuck is this?
- Scott.</i>

1499
01:34:13,525 --> 01:34:14,959
Fucking don't!

1500
01:34:14,994 --> 01:34:17,861
I will call the fucking Mafia,
and they will come here

1501
01:34:17,895 --> 01:34:20,597
and bring you to the desert
and fucking bury you!

1502
01:34:20,632 --> 01:34:23,266
Stay back!

1503
01:34:30,574 --> 01:34:32,142
<i>Scott!</i>

1504
01:34:32,176 --> 01:34:33,676
<i>Scott!</i>

1505
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:34,977
I want to talk to Lee!

1506
01:34:41,485 --> 01:34:44,221
<i>I want to talk to Lee.</i>

1507
01:34:44,256 --> 01:34:46,423
That's not
going to happen, Scott.

1508
01:34:49,226 --> 01:34:50,660
You know what?
Fine.

1509
01:34:50,694 --> 01:34:54,030
If this is how he wants to
handle this kind of situation...

1510
01:34:55,366 --> 01:34:57,167
<i>then I want to leave.</i>

1511
01:34:58,669 --> 01:35:01,070
<i>But I am taking all of my
personal belongings with me.</i>

1512
01:35:01,104 --> 01:35:04,174
<i>All of them, Seymour,
or I will fucking sue you!</i>

1513
01:35:04,208 --> 01:35:07,776
Listen.
You have my word.

1514
01:35:07,810 --> 01:35:09,944
If you vacate
the apartment now,

1515
01:35:09,979 --> 01:35:12,314
you can come back
during the Academy Awards...

1516
01:35:12,348 --> 01:35:15,684
and I'll have all your belongings
ready for you to pick up.

1517
01:35:17,887 --> 01:35:19,921
<i>Wow.</i>

1518
01:35:19,955 --> 01:35:22,690
Stick it in
and break it off, huh?

1519
01:35:29,398 --> 01:35:32,099
<i>From the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion</i>

1520
01:35:32,133 --> 01:35:34,369
<i>in Los Angeles,
California...</i>

1521
01:35:34,404 --> 01:35:35,470
Wow.

1522
01:35:35,505 --> 01:35:39,407
<i>The 54th annual
Academy Awards!</i>

1523
01:35:47,382 --> 01:35:49,016
Wow.

1524
01:36:22,048 --> 01:36:25,150
Actually, though, it's
kind of a cokey piano.

1525
01:36:44,436 --> 01:36:46,003
<i>Is it true
that you and Liberace</i>

1526
01:36:46,037 --> 01:36:48,406
<i>made an oral agreement when you
first went to work for him</i>

1527
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:51,609
<i>- and moved from Los Angeles to Las Vegas?
- Yes.</i>

1528
01:36:51,644 --> 01:36:53,478
You contend that
at some later date

1529
01:36:53,512 --> 01:36:55,012
after making
that oral agreement,

1530
01:36:55,046 --> 01:36:57,148
the oral agreement was put
into a written agreement

1531
01:36:57,182 --> 01:36:59,516
- prepared by attorney Joel Strote?
- Yes.

1532
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:02,819
- Where he made certain promises to you.
- Yes.

1533
01:37:02,853 --> 01:37:05,389
<i>- Did you ever sign that written agreement?
- Yes, I did.</i>

1534
01:37:05,423 --> 01:37:08,725
<i>- Did Liberace ever sign that written agreement?
- Yes.</i>

1535
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:10,427
<i>Did you ever receive
a copy of it?</i>

1536
01:37:10,461 --> 01:37:13,462
Joel Strote
has my copy.

1537
01:37:13,497 --> 01:37:17,466
<i>Was there ever any other written
agreement between you and Liberace</i>

1538
01:37:17,501 --> 01:37:19,869
<i>other than this one
prepared by Joel Strote?</i>

1539
01:37:19,904 --> 01:37:22,872
Yes. The will.
My will.

1540
01:37:22,907 --> 01:37:26,710
- Did you ever execute this will?
- Yes.

1541
01:37:26,744 --> 01:37:29,745
Did anyone witness
your executed will?

1542
01:37:30,814 --> 01:37:33,115
When you mean
"executed", uh...

1543
01:37:33,149 --> 01:37:35,418
I didn't
sign it yet.

1544
01:37:35,452 --> 01:37:39,789
- I mean--
- He doesn't understand "executed" to mean signing.

1545
01:37:39,823 --> 01:37:42,157
<i>What did you mean
when you said "executed"?</i>

1546
01:37:42,192 --> 01:37:44,126
Well, you mean,
did I ever sign it?

1547
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:46,361
No, I never did.
No.

1548
01:37:46,395 --> 01:37:48,463
Why didn't you
ever sign it?

1549
01:37:48,497 --> 01:37:52,367
Because Liberace and I
were having problems.

1550
01:37:52,401 --> 01:37:55,169
What kind of problems?

1551
01:37:55,204 --> 01:37:57,739
I felt that he was
seeing other people.

1552
01:37:58,941 --> 01:38:02,209
Did you ever receive
a copy of this will?

1553
01:38:02,243 --> 01:38:05,946
<i>Joel Strote
kept my copy for me.</i>

1554
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:08,081
<i>Was it your expectation
that you would become</i>

1555
01:38:08,115 --> 01:38:11,353
<i>- the legally adopted son of Liberace?
- Yes.</i>

1556
01:38:11,387 --> 01:38:13,555
<i>And continue in a sexual
relationship with him</i>

1557
01:38:13,589 --> 01:38:16,424
<i>- after the adoption?
- No.</i>

1558
01:38:16,459 --> 01:38:19,159
<i>Is that when you thought
the sex would stop?</i>

1559
01:38:20,261 --> 01:38:22,363
Our relationship
towards later on

1560
01:38:22,397 --> 01:38:25,799
went from a sexual
relationship to...

1561
01:38:25,834 --> 01:38:28,769
Lee always thought of me
as more of a son.

1562
01:38:28,803 --> 01:38:30,738
We had our
sexual relationship

1563
01:38:30,772 --> 01:38:32,239
in the beginning
of our relationship

1564
01:38:32,273 --> 01:38:35,341
and it was, more or less,
he thought of me as a--

1565
01:38:35,376 --> 01:38:38,778
He wanted me to think of him
as a, as a father type image.

1566
01:38:38,812 --> 01:38:42,749
He thought--
It's just so hard to explain.

1567
01:38:42,783 --> 01:38:44,550
<i>His duties were expanded</i>

1568
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:48,020
<i>to be a road manager,
acting as a buffer for me...</i>

1569
01:38:48,054 --> 01:38:52,758
you know, for various employees
in various hotels...

1570
01:38:52,792 --> 01:38:56,060
the fans, media,
answering the phone...

1571
01:38:56,095 --> 01:38:59,197
answering knocks
on the door...

1572
01:38:59,231 --> 01:39:01,734
driving me from places
of engagement

1573
01:39:01,769 --> 01:39:04,871
where limousines
were not provided for me.

1574
01:39:04,905 --> 01:39:07,372
<i>Did you make a
gift of three bedroom sets</i>

1575
01:39:07,407 --> 01:39:10,141
<i>- to Scott Thorson?
- No.</i>

1576
01:39:10,175 --> 01:39:12,611
<i>Did you make a gift of lamps
to Scott Thorson?</i>

1577
01:39:12,645 --> 01:39:13,912
No.

1578
01:39:13,946 --> 01:39:16,448
<i>Did you make a gift
of a water buffalo head,</i>

1579
01:39:16,482 --> 01:39:20,118
- mounted, to Scott Thorson?
- No.

1580
01:39:20,152 --> 01:39:21,786
Did you make a gift
of any furniture

1581
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:25,589
<i>- to Scott Thorson?
- No.</i>

1582
01:39:25,624 --> 01:39:27,858
What reason do you have
for believing that

1583
01:39:27,893 --> 01:39:29,993
the furniture and furnishings
you think of as gifts

1584
01:39:30,028 --> 01:39:31,796
were, in fact,
not gifts?

1585
01:39:31,830 --> 01:39:34,064
Well, this is what I do
with all my homes.

1586
01:39:34,098 --> 01:39:37,234
I furnish all my homes
for people to use.

1587
01:39:37,268 --> 01:39:39,502
But that does not mean
they can take the furniture

1588
01:39:39,537 --> 01:39:41,103
with them
when they leave.

1589
01:39:41,138 --> 01:39:43,773
It's my property.

1590
01:39:43,808 --> 01:39:46,810
Did you make a gift of any
furs to Scott Thorson?

1591
01:39:46,844 --> 01:39:49,312
<i>- Yes.
- What furs?</i>

1592
01:39:49,346 --> 01:39:54,116
<i>Uh, a raccoon,
a black mink trenchcoat,</i>

1593
01:39:54,151 --> 01:39:57,520
<i>a leather
and black mink coat...</i>

1594
01:39:57,555 --> 01:40:00,723
<i>and um, that's it.</i>

1595
01:40:00,758 --> 01:40:04,060
And what other gifts have
you made to Scott Thorson?

1596
01:40:04,094 --> 01:40:05,862
<i>Jewelry.</i>

1597
01:40:06,730 --> 01:40:08,130
<i>What form of jewelry?</i>

1598
01:40:08,165 --> 01:40:10,999
A ring with
his initial on it...

1599
01:40:11,033 --> 01:40:14,837
and two Krugerrands
made up the ring.

1600
01:40:15,905 --> 01:40:18,306
Gold chains.

1601
01:40:18,341 --> 01:40:22,444
Australian opal ring.

1602
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:24,713
Bracelets,
things like that.

1603
01:40:24,747 --> 01:40:27,949
<i>Okay, first off, you
have to understand something.</i>

1604
01:40:27,983 --> 01:40:29,750
<i>You're not getting
any of your property back.</i>

1605
01:40:29,785 --> 01:40:31,018
<i>You're not getting a dime...</i>

1606
01:40:31,052 --> 01:40:32,820
unless you sign
this agreement.

1607
01:40:32,855 --> 01:40:34,489
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1608
01:40:34,523 --> 01:40:36,290
All right.

1609
01:40:36,324 --> 01:40:38,459
You're going to get
$75,000 in cash,

1610
01:40:38,494 --> 01:40:40,294
three of your cars,
three dogs

1611
01:40:40,328 --> 01:40:41,728
and all
your clothes.

1612
01:40:41,762 --> 01:40:43,530
$75,000?
That's it?

1613
01:40:43,564 --> 01:40:45,399
In return for the
money, the cars,

1614
01:40:45,433 --> 01:40:47,134
the dogs and the
personal property...

1615
01:40:47,168 --> 01:40:48,469
you're going to
sign over the title

1616
01:40:48,503 --> 01:40:50,403
of your Las Vegas home
on Laramore to Lee.

1617
01:40:50,437 --> 01:40:52,873
And that's estimated value
right now at $200,000.

1618
01:40:52,907 --> 01:40:55,174
<i>You're going to give over
all the contents to Lee,</i>

1619
01:40:55,209 --> 01:40:57,243
estimated at $50,000.

1620
01:40:57,277 --> 01:40:59,345
In addition,
you will be required

1621
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:02,649
to sign over the titles
of your Chevrolet van,

1622
01:41:02,683 --> 01:41:04,750
the antique Cadillac
and your Auburn

1623
01:41:04,784 --> 01:41:06,418
to Mr. Liberace.

1624
01:41:06,452 --> 01:41:08,020
You will also give up
any other claims

1625
01:41:08,054 --> 01:41:11,123
against Mr. Liberace
of any kind in the future.

1626
01:41:11,157 --> 01:41:15,360
So assault, battery,
palimony-- out.

1627
01:41:15,395 --> 01:41:18,096
And you're going to sign
a clause prohibiting you

1628
01:41:18,131 --> 01:41:20,532
from revealing the true
nature of your relationship

1629
01:41:20,566 --> 01:41:21,799
to anybody,
public or private.

1630
01:41:21,834 --> 01:41:23,134
This is the best
we could do?

1631
01:41:23,168 --> 01:41:27,639
They're shortchanging
me $250,000.

1632
01:41:27,673 --> 01:41:30,207
Well, there's nothing in here
about the jewelry he gave you,

1633
01:41:30,242 --> 01:41:31,943
- so you get to keep that.
- I had to sell the jewelry!

1634
01:41:31,977 --> 01:41:36,080
- For what?
- For legal, uh, fees and other things.

1635
01:41:37,883 --> 01:41:40,885
I don't care...
what the judge says,

1636
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:42,654
we were
fucking married!

1637
01:41:42,688 --> 01:41:45,623
Well, the law says
you weren't.

1638
01:41:45,658 --> 01:41:48,860
And a contract for sex
can't be enforced.

1639
01:41:48,894 --> 01:41:52,430
Scott, listen to me.
You're a drug addict.

1640
01:41:52,464 --> 01:41:54,497
<i>This is all
you're getting.</i>

1641
01:41:54,532 --> 01:41:56,399
<i>Sign it.</i>

1642
01:41:58,736 --> 01:42:00,503
You know, I called
Billy Leatherwood.

1643
01:42:00,538 --> 01:42:02,305
He got more.

1644
01:42:12,348 --> 01:42:14,316

Just a little
something...

1702
01:47:37,794 --> 01:47:40,096
to remember me by.

1703
01:47:49,105 --> 01:47:51,673
<i>At 2:05 p.m. today...</i>

1704

cardiac failure.

where it will be
prepared for burial.

1708
01:48:03,552 --> 01:48:05,720
In an unusual
twist of events...

1709
01:48:05,754 --> 01:48:07,588
the Riverside County
Health Department

1710
01:48:07,623 --> 01:48:09,590
has rejected
the death certificate...

1711
01:48:09,625 --> 01:48:12,593
by Liberace's attending
doctor, Ronald Daniels,

1712
01:48:12,628 --> 01:48:13,994
and has ordered
an autopsy.

1713
01:48:14,029 --> 01:48:18,398
This request
is unseemly.

1714
01:48:18,433 --> 01:48:20,867
Mr. Liberace died
of heart failure...

1715
01:48:20,902 --> 01:48:24,370
due to an anemia caused
by a watermelon diet.

1716
01:48:24,405 --> 01:48:27,607
The body has already
been embalmed!

1717
01:48:27,642 --> 01:48:30,912
With respect to Liberace's
family during this time,

1718
01:48:30,946 --> 01:48:34,347
we have asked that the request
for autopsy be rejected.

1719
01:48:34,381 --> 01:48:37,551
Since Mr. Liberace
has already been embalmed,

1720
01:48:37,585 --> 01:48:40,787
it was necessary
to take tissue samples.

1721
01:48:40,822 --> 01:48:42,689
Along with the medical
records of blood tests

1722
01:48:42,723 --> 01:48:45,124
during his recent stay at the
Eisenhower Medical Center...

1723
01:48:45,159 --> 01:48:49,095
it is the conclusion of the Riverside
County Health Department...

1724
01:48:49,129 --> 01:48:51,797
that Mr. Liberace
died of complications

1725
01:48:51,832 --> 01:48:53,766
due to the AIDS virus.

1726
01:49:10,115 --> 01:49:11,983
<i>Thank you
all for coming.</i>

1727
01:49:12,017 --> 01:49:14,018
<i>I think that what should be
remembered today</i>

1728
01:49:14,052 --> 01:49:15,520
<i>is that Lee
was a great professional...</i>

1729
01:49:15,554 --> 01:49:17,856
<i>a great showman,
he loved his fans.</i>

1730
01:49:17,890 --> 01:49:20,391
<i>But we should also
look to the future.</i>

1731
01:49:20,425 --> 01:49:22,158
<i>As a result
of the scholarship program</i>

1732
01:49:22,193 --> 01:49:24,596
<i>which he's established
through his foundation...</i>

1733
01:49:24,630 --> 01:49:26,764
many young people will have
a musical education

1734
01:49:26,799 --> 01:49:28,900
which they otherwise
could not afford.

1735
01:49:28,934 --> 01:49:30,768
Thank you.

1736
01:49:33,105 --> 01:49:34,706
<i>My dear
people, let us begin</i>

1737
01:49:34,740 --> 01:49:36,508
<i>as we begin
all things holy.</i>

1738
01:49:36,542 --> 01:49:38,842
<i>In the name of the Father,
and of the Son,</i>

1739
01:49:38,877 --> 01:49:40,544
<i>and of the Holy Spirit.</i>

1740
01:49:40,578 --> 01:49:41,778
<i>Amen.</i>

1741
01:49:41,813 --> 01:49:44,114
The grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ...

1742
01:49:44,148 --> 01:49:47,450
the love of God, and the
fellowship of the Holy Spirit

1743
01:49:47,485 --> 01:49:48,852
be with you always.

1744
01:49:48,887 --> 01:49:50,621
And with your spirit.

1745
01:49:50,655 --> 01:49:52,589
<i>In the waters of baptism,</i>

1746
01:49:52,624 --> 01:49:54,924
<i>Liberace
died with Christ</i>

1747
01:49:54,958 --> 01:49:57,192
<i>and rose within
to a new life.</i>

1748
01:49:57,227 --> 01:49:58,828
<i>May he now share
with Him</i>

1749
01:49:58,862 --> 01:50:02,297
in eternal glory.

1750
01:50:02,332 --> 01:50:04,667
Let us pray.

1751
01:51:04,425 --> 01:51:08,996
"To dream
the impossible dream

1752
01:51:10,131 --> 01:51:14,301
To be better far
than you are

1753
01:51:16,337 --> 01:51:21,508
<i>To try when your arms
are too weary</i>

1754
01:51:21,542 --> 01:51:25,912
<i>To reach
that unreachable star</i>

1755
01:51:27,247 --> 01:51:30,049
This is my quest

1756
01:51:30,084 --> 01:51:33,352
To follow that star

1757
01:51:33,386 --> 01:51:36,489
No matter
how hopeless

1758
01:51:36,523 --> 01:51:39,524
No matter how far

1759
01:51:39,558 --> 01:51:42,027
<i>To be willing to give</i>

1760
01:51:42,061 --> 01:51:44,596
<i>When there's
no more to give</i>

1761
01:51:44,631 --> 01:51:47,065
To be willing to die

1762
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:50,769
So that honor and justice
may live

1763
01:51:52,171 --> 01:51:54,404
And I know

1764
01:51:54,439 --> 01:51:57,241
If I'll only be true

1765
01:51:57,275 --> 01:52:00,946
To this glorious quest

1766
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:02,848
<i>My heart</i>

1767
01:52:02,882 --> 01:52:05,884
<i>Shall lie peaceful
and calm</i>

1768
01:52:05,918 --> 01:52:09,787
When I'm laid
to my rest."

1769

Thank you.

I still believe
