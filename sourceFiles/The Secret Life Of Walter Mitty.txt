00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,076
Hi. Todd Maher, eHarmony.

2
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,911
How can I help you today?

3
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:36,181
Hi. I can't seem to leave
a wink for someone.

4
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,083
I don't know, is my page broken?

5
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,151
Do I... do I maybe have
a broken page or...?

6
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:42,087
I've never heard
of that, but okay.

7
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,022
You're trying to use
your eHarmony account

8
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,023
for the first time?

9
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,525
I am.

10
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,827
Okay. I'm looking
at your profile.

11
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,296
We have a pretty intricate
matching algorithm.

12
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,865
That's what distinguishes us from
other online dating services.

13
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,700
Yeah, I like that.

14
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:58,670
Actually, I'm just trying
to leave a wink for one person.

15
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,539
Cheryl Melhoff?

16
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,208
She started in my division
at work about a month ago,

17
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,843
and I overheard her
near the bagels

18
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,278
saying she was on your site.

19
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,313
Okay, that's unique,

20
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,681
but let me ask you,

21
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,182
you left a lot of this stuff,

22
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:13,852
like... like the "Been There,
Done That" section,

23
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,153
you left it blank.

24
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,788
Yeah, I think I skipped it.

25
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,291
Okay, well, you got to
help me out here, man.

26
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,926
Don't skip stuff.

27
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,796
Okay, well, I haven't
really been anywhere...

28
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:27,132
noteworthy or mentionable.

29
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,334
Have you...
have you done anything

30
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:32,304
noteworthy, mentionable?

31
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:37,676
Hello? You still there?

32
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,678
Can you hang on a second?

33
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:49,287
My God!

34
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:51,156
Go, go, go! Get out!

35
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,624
Get out! She's gonna blow!

36
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,692
Go! Go!

37
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,796
Chips!
Over here!

38
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,631
Chips!

39
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,299
Thank you! How'd you know
about the building?

40
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,268
I heard barking,
thought I smelled gas.

41
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,936
I hope it's okay.

42
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:08,239
I engineered a prosthesis for Chips while
I was sprinting down the stairwell.

43
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,042
Little hip-joint assembly
with a drop-ring lock

44
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:13,845
and an anterior pelvic band.
God, you're noteworthy.

45
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,313
I just live by the ABCs.

46
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:17,248
Adventurous, brave, creative.

47
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:18,982
That's everything
I want in a man.

48
00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:23,221
My man?

49
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,856
Hey, my man, you still there?

50
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,892
Hey.

51
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:30,195
What, did you pass out or...?

52
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,397
No, I just, like, zoned out
for a second.

53
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,765
Okay.

54
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,133
Do you do that a lot?

55
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,769
A normal amount,

56
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,005
I guess.

57
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,374
Yeah... I...
I got to run. Sorry.

58
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,175
O-Okay, but we...
we need a lot more...

59
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:24,282
Hey, bad day to be late.

60
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:25,784
We just got acquired.

61
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,986
What?
Yeah, over the weekend.

62
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:30,388
Walter, happy birthday!

63
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,124
He's 42 years old!

64
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,993
Odessa, what are you doing here?

65
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:38,063
Mom made you your favorite
clementine cake.

66
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,999
Aren't you supposed to be at the retirement
place with her getting the piano moved in?

67
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,734
Yes, I was there.
It's, like, halfway done.

68
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,003
Piano is out of the van,
it's on the street.

69
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,705
Everything's fine,
but I just got a phone call

70
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,074
about a really big audition,
so can you go finish it?

71
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,276
No, I can't; I'm late.
Walter, I...

72
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,745
I don't think you're seeing this
from what I need.

73
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,146
What do you...
What do you need?

74
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:57,015
I need to be Rizzo in<i> Grease.</i>

75
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,017
I don't understand that.

76
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,752
My audition... Rizzo.

77
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,353
Rizzo?
Rizzo.

78
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:04,823
She's tough and tender.
Do me a favor, please.

79
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,158
Make sure Mom's piano gets
moved in all the way, all right?

80
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:08,793
Don't go to Rizzo.

81
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:09,961
Thanks, Walter.

82
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,763
Happy birthday!

83
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,898
Guess what.
We just got acquired.

84
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:15,734
Yeah, I heard.
Yeah.

85
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,069
There's gonna be changes,
downsizing of us

86
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,171
into some kind
of dot-com thing possibly.

87
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:21,806
I wonder how

88
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:23,041
this thing goes down,

89
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,809
how the transition's
gonna play out.

90
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,444
I could probably tell you.

91
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:27,946
Ted Hendricks,

92
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,448
managing director
of the transition.

93
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,084
Hey. Tim Naughton, sales.

94
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:36,421
Gary Mannheim, graphic design.

95
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:40,325
And what do you do, cake man?

96
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,261
I...

97
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,829
I do the, um...

98
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,930
The cake's just for today.

99
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:47,165
I'm not a cake man.

100
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,034
I do... I-I deal dirctly...

101
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:52,771
"Dirctly"?

102
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,073
Directly with,

103
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,474
<i>LIFE's</i> photo units...

104
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:58,309
I'm sorry, I was really getting
into this song.

105
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,445
I stopped listening to you.

106
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,483
I was saying, you know
who looks good in a beard?

107
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:07,352
Dumbledore, not you.

108
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,794
Guy...

109
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,429
Guy?

110
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,199
What do you do?

111
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,334
I'm a negative asset manager.

112
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:28,106
Worth the wait.

113
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,385
Ted.
Donny.

114
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,921
You feeling tough?
Feeling good.

115
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,190
Well, got to make
some tough calls ahead.

116
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,524
You've been here before, yeah?

117
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:47,992
Yeah, so this is it?

118
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:49,460
Yeah, the house of pictures.

119
00:08:58,937 --> 00:09:00,205
Hey.

120
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,372
Hi.

121
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:02,540
How was your weekend?

122
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,609
I...
I had an awesome weekend.

123
00:09:22,393 --> 00:09:24,162
And what did you do this weekend?

124
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,431
Um, let's see.

125
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,968
I bathed in Arctic mountain water

126
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,237
while my Latin lover
recited verse to me.

127
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,938
You slut.
I know.

128
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:37,308
Actually, I waited for my refrigerator
repairman who never came.

129
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:38,643
I'm so sorry.

130
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,078
I'm gonna call you later.

131
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,511
Okay.

132
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:46,517
The ice, yes?

133
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:48,385
She moves like a woman.

134
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:52,257
I'm Walter. Mitty.

135
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,159
Cheryl. Melhoff.

136
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,461
Where have you been?

137
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:59,130
Testing the limits
of the human spirit.

138
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,666
I'd like to climb your hair,

139
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,334
test that out.

140
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:04,602
Perhaps I can contact you

141
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:07,305
possibly through
my poetry falcon.

142
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,473
Poetry falcon.

143
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,073
I like that.

144
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:17,482
Do you think if I hit him with
a paper clip, would he move?

145
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,616
Yeah, I don't know.

146
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:21,386
Do it. Hello.

147
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,955
I actually threw
a toner box at him once.

148
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,156
Yeah? Did he move?

149
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,358
No, I-I missed.

150
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,494
That's a great story.

151
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,363
Ground control to Major Tom.

152
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:35,298
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

153
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:43,440
Wow.

154
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:47,345
- Moving on, as they say.
- Yeah.

155
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,480
Conference room,

156
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:51,516
more of these stations here

157
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,051
where people sort of
do their thing.

158
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,751
Layouts here for...

159
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:06,164
Morning, Hernando.

160
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,099
There's a new nut pouch.

161
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,467
Did you hear?

162
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,202
Yeah.

163
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,004
I... met him.

164
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,372
We're gonna be evaluated.

165
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,606
They won't be able to.

166
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:17,308
We do intricate
details back here.

167
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,643
Yeah.

168
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,278
It's tricky and bewildering.

169
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,547
I should evaluate you;
you should evaluate me.

170
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,549
I don't think
they'll let us do that.

171
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,682
Just saying.

172
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,556
Hey, how long has
this neg roll been here,

173
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,623
out in the open?

174
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,762
It's a Sean O'Connell.

175
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,130
It came in this morning.

176
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,398
There's a present, too.

177
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,401
He sent you a present
on your desk.

178
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:46,037
Sean O'Connell
still shoots on film.

179
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,171
That results for me
in a man crush.

180
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:52,176
Hey, you want to mount these?

181
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:53,478
Seriously?

182
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,811
Sure.

183
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,692
<i>Heard rumblings</i> LIFE's<i> done, man.</i>

184
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,194
<i>Wanted to say thanks.</i>

185
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:11,629
<i>Take a look inside.</i>

186
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,432
<i>A gift for all the years</i>
<i>of hard work.</i>

187
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,401
<i>Sorry about the neg roll.</i>

188
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:20,738
<i>I spilled some blood on it while
self-stitching a gun wound to my abdomen,</i>

189
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:24,308
<i>but number 25 is my best ever.</i>

190
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:26,744
<i>The quintessence of</i> LIFE,
<i>I think.</i>

191
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,580
<i>I trust you'll get it</i>
<i>where it needs to go.</i>

192
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:31,481
<i>You always do.</i>

193
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:52,770
What'd you get?

194
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:55,906
Um, it's a wallet.

195
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:05,582
With<i> LIFE's</i> motto on it.

196
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,859
Here you go.

197
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:22,567
Where's 25?

198
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:23,768
It's not there.

199
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:27,438
Hey.

200
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,407
We need negative 25.

201
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,610
Sean O'Connell sent a telegram.

202
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:33,811
An actual telegram.

203
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,813
A 100-year-old dude came
in a little hat.

204
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,549
So there's a floor meeting.

205
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,650
Bring 25.

206
00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:45,590
It-it's here somewhere.

207
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:46,891
We'll find it.

208
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,860
Okay, make a contact sheet
of these frames

209
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,329
as soon as you can, and don't
say anything to anyone.

210
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,463
Yeah.

211
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,699
I just wanted to inform you all,

212
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,833
reluctantly, that...

213
00:14:02,173 --> 00:14:04,575
I guess just start back
from the beginning.

214
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:06,244
Okay.

215
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,845
I just wanted to inform you all

216
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:10,681
reluctantly that,
this month's issue

217
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:12,383
will be our last.

218
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,518
What?

219
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,219
Yeah, what?

220
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,555
- That's some bull.
- Yeah.

221
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,522
Sad...

222
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:23,895
news for sure.

223
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,497
Now, you're all valued employees,

224
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,533
but as we undergo this transition

225
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,201
to, <i> LIFE Online,</i>

226
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,637
we wanted to be candid
with you that,

227
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,640
some of you will be determined
non-vital employees

228
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,408
to the new...
the new partnership,

229
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,478
and we'll be deciding which of those
positions will be remaining with us

230
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,480
over the course of the next week.

231
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,716
Also, we feel sad about that,

232
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,385
as you can see.

233
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,654
Now, for some good news.

234
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,356
We are very excited for...
All right, Don.

235
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:55,426
Ted Hendricks, managing director
of the transition.

236
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,962
Never fun, this stage.

237
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,898
But we do have ahead of us

238
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,634
the privilege
of publishing what will be

239
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:06,904
the very last issue
of<i> LIFE</i> magazine.

240
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:08,673
And for the final issue,

241
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,742
we just received a telegram...
come on...

242
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:13,744
from Sean O'Connell,

243
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:15,813
who has never, I'm told,

244
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,216
been willing to speak
with the executives here.

245
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,284
Well, he broke his long silence

246
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:24,889
and shared his thoughts with us
through that... that old man.

247
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,792
Sean O'Connell.

248
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,393
"I expect full consideration

249
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:33,264
"of negative 25 for cover.

250
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,266
"My most grand,

251
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,935
the quintessence of<i> LIFE."</i>

252
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:40,905
The... what is that?

253
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,740
What-what is that?
It means, like, the fullest

254
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,475
and most rich.
Okay.

255
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,544
So our cover will probably
be the most famous ever

256
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,647
because it really will have the
big quintessence of all time.

257
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,716
Very full and so rich.

258
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,521
So let's see this thing?

259
00:15:57,522 --> 00:15:58,956
Let's see it.

260
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:00,791
Can we... What do we...
What am I doing up here?

261
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,260
What's going on?

262
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,461
We'll receive it now
from Negative Assets.

263
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,562
This gentleman here.
Negative Assets.

264
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,630
Last man in.
What's that?

265
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,565
Major Tom.

266
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:08,733
Can I,

267
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,634
get that?

268
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:15,940
It's, being processed.

269
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,642
All right, well, let's do it.

270
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,510
Let's process some quintessence.

271
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,512
Come on.

272
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,347
Go.

273
00:16:23,348 --> 00:16:24,882
Now.

274
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:26,617
That's why I'm clapping.

275
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,718
Wait, when do we go to press?
Two and a half weeks.

276
00:16:29,954 --> 00:16:33,024
Please don't worry.
You're going to be fine, okay?

277
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,692
You've been here forever;
I'm sure he won't...

278
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,994
Don't worry, it's gonna be fine.

279
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:39,497
It was nice talking to you.

280
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,532
Well, guess I'll talk
to you later. Okay.

281
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,467
Hi.

282
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:45,636
Hi.
Hi.

283
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,772
I'm, Walter.

284
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:48,873
Cheryl.

285
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,541
Mitty.
Melhoff.

286
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,910
Yes, You...

287
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,012
you work in Photo Accounts,
right?

288
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:56,314
I do.

289
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:57,381
Negative Assets.

290
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:58,816
Yes. I'm...
Yeah.

291
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,785
Processing the last cover photo.

292
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,520
That's-that's a big deal.

293
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,854
Yeah, it's... there's...

294
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:05,022
We have a glitch.

295
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,691
Mini on that one right now.

296
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,326
I wanted to say to you,

297
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,593
do you maybe

298
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:12,997
have an address
for Sean O'Connell?

299
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,766
Um, it's not really
that easy with him.

300
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,768
He moves around so much.
I don't.

301
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:18,903
Yeah, he's on a freelance.

302
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,504
I don't know where,

303
00:17:20,505 --> 00:17:22,440
and he doesn't have a phone.

304
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,908
No phone? He's old-school.

305
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:24,975
Yeah.

306
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:26,877
Well...

307
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:28,746
Um, but, you know, um,

308
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,047
why don't I check with Peg?

309
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:31,916
I know she just processed
a check for him,

310
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,718
and we could track
his payout, maybe,

311
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,952
find him that way?

312
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,053
Cool.

313
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:37,655
Very cool.

314
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:38,823
Okay.
Okay. Walter.

315
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:39,824
- Yes.
- All right.

316
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:40,825
All right.
I'm on it.

317
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:41,826
Okay.

318
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:42,993
Thanks.

319
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:44,395
Yes, okay.
Are you coming?

320
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,963
Yes, I'm not.

321
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,531
Yes, I have to stay.

322
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:51,167
Here's the contact sheet.

323
00:17:58,743 --> 00:18:00,010
What do you see?

324
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:01,746
This photo cluster, these three,

325
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,814
they're the only printable ones.

326
00:18:03,815 --> 00:18:06,517
He took them around
the same time he took 25.

327
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,753
They could give us a clue
to where Sean is.

328
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,087
Blow them up, all right?

329
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:11,588
Cool.

330
00:18:26,604 --> 00:18:28,406
Hey.

331
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,507
Walter, right?

332
00:18:33,043 --> 00:18:34,145
Yeah.

333
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,913
So I called Peg about Sean.

334
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,548
She's gonna get back to me.

335
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,817
Hey, thanks.

336
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,152
Cool glasses.

337
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,154
Very Sand People.

338
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,755
These? These are...

339
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,757
No, these are loupes.
They're for work.

340
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,692
They magnify the...
Is that 25?

341
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:49,927
Can I see?

342
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,095
That's, no.

343
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,931
I can't quite find 25

344
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,733
just now.

345
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,135
You can't find it?

346
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:00,004
Yeah, that's why
I'm trying to find Sean.

347
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,006
I'm trying to track him
down somehow

348
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,508
with, these other images.

349
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:06,444
His whereabouts?

350
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,944
Yeah.

351
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:12,483
I take this class,
Writing the Mystery Novel.

352
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,884
Anyway, they say the key

353
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:15,486
is to work backwards.

354
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,689
You connect the clues and then
scatter them so they seem unrelated.

355
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,624
There's, like,
a whole science to it.

356
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:21,725
May I?

357
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:22,793
Sure.

358
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,628
Okay.

359
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:25,896
Thumb.

360
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:27,665
Yeah, it's a...

361
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,533
It's an unknown thumb.
Okay.

362
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:30,967
Water?

363
00:19:32,203 --> 00:19:34,205
Just water, I guess?
Yeah, just water.

364
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,973
Okay.

365
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,776
And, um...

366
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,479
like, a curved piece of...

367
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,148
some kind of part of a thing.

368
00:19:46,984 --> 00:19:48,219
But, hey, you know,

369
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,188
the thing with clues, my teacher says,
is you really only need one good one

370
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:53,123
and then they'll connect,
and you'll be like,

371
00:19:53,124 --> 00:19:55,559
"Yes, of course,
unknown thumb, water.

372
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,761
I should've seen this
the whole time."

373
00:19:57,762 --> 00:19:59,563
Yeah, yeah, I'll be like,

374
00:19:59,564 --> 00:20:01,631
like...

375
00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:06,670
Well, anyway, I should get back

376
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:09,305
and try not to get fired.

377
00:20:14,178 --> 00:20:15,278
Hey, Cheryl?

378
00:20:17,114 --> 00:20:19,750
I have something creative
I've been working on, too.

379
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,919
A little side project.

380
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:29,693
Walter, it's amazing.

381
00:20:29,694 --> 00:20:31,662
Walter.

382
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:34,899
I was just saying I'll let you
know when I hear back from Peg.

383
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,567
Okay.

384
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,768
Thank you.

385
00:20:46,143 --> 00:20:48,212
Hey, Odessa.

386
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,747
What?

387
00:20:58,656 --> 00:21:00,691
Is there a larger
apartment available

388
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,192
the piano could fit in?

389
00:21:02,193 --> 00:21:04,762
'Cause that's a memento
of our mom's.

390
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,598
That's a really big...

391
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,601
Most people sell their really big
mementos before they move here.

392
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,070
My dad bought it for her
the year they were married,

393
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,272
and it means a lot to her.

394
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:18,008
That's a villa.
It's a little more costly,

395
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:19,610
but it has a more generous,

396
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,812
piano kind of size living room
for you, though.

397
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,347
Yeah.
Yeah, this is good.

398
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,083
On move-in, you'd need first month's,
last month's and full deposit.

399
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,118
That's, $4,700.
Great.

400
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,753
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, we'll take it.

401
00:21:29,754 --> 00:21:30,988
I'll get the paperwork.

402
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:33,123
The new villa comes open
in three weeks.

403
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:34,325
I'm guessing.

404
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,694
Okay.

405
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,361
Happy birthday.

406
00:21:39,697 --> 00:21:42,032
Stretch Armstrong!
Stretch Armstrong.

407
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:43,667
That's cool.
Yeah.

408
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:45,002
Isn't that awesome?
Wow.

409
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,904
This was your favorite thing
when we were little.

410
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:47,938
Do you remember?
Yeah.

411
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,039
You want to do it?

412
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,341
Yeah, all right.

413
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,875
Come on, Stretch!

414
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:53,110
Good, good!

415
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,645
Okay, come on, we got to go.

416
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,913
<i>A villa, okay,</i>

417
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,648
but hey,
I'm not the Queen of Sheba.

418
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,216
You got to have room
for your piano.

419
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:02,319
You can stay at my place until it's ready.
Well, I won't be cramping your scene.

420
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,121
My scene? No.
Yeah.

421
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,156
And I'm sorry we couldn't
get you in here today.

422
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:07,224
Walter!

423
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,792
Look what I found!

424
00:22:08,793 --> 00:22:11,762
Th-This is from you
and Tim Linderman.

425
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:14,098
Did you remember,
we were gonna backpack Europe?

426
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,766
That June Dad died?

427
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:16,867
Man!

428
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,902
What is in here?

429
00:22:18,903 --> 00:22:20,671
That's my Walter box,
so those are my

430
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,206
Walter knickknacks and keepsakes.

431
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,674
You made the best mix tapes.

432
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,275
Man.

433
00:22:25,276 --> 00:22:27,244
What? What's that?

434
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,113
Travel journal Dad gave me.

435
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,682
You should donate that...

436
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,817
because you never used
it... to a poor kid.

437
00:22:33,818 --> 00:22:35,786
A poor kid who's
going to travel to Europe?

438
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,688
What...
Look at you
and your dad.

439
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,123
Is that my tournament one?

440
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:42,159
He was so proud of this.

441
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,663
Sharing your accomplishments
with the whole world.

442
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:48,032
It's from the
<i>Fairview Smalltowner,</i> Mom.

443
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,868
Well, I really liked
that nifty Mohawk.

444
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,170
You know, when your daddy died,
and then you went

445
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,772
to work in that pizza place,

446
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,708
the one that was named
after a father...

447
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,710
had that father kind of name.
Papa John's.

448
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,979
Yeah. Delivery.
And I thought perhaps

449
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,448
that it-it was really sad
for you working in a restaurant

450
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:07,250
named after a father,
after your father just died.

451
00:23:08,385 --> 00:23:09,819
I never even thought about that.

452
00:23:11,121 --> 00:23:12,790
Probably 'cause I didn't
call Dad "Papa."

453
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,458
You had a weird style.

454
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:17,361
That wasn't my style.
That was a uniform... KFC.

455
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,163
My worker bee.

456
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,965
Aw.

457
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,002
"Word in the water"?

458
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:26,804
Okay, you know what?
I got to go.

459
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,806
We're getting you
into a villa situation, okay?

460
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,207
Okay.
Good, everybody?

461
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,209
My worker bee
and my performance artist bee.

462
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,409
Aw, thank you, Mom.

463
00:23:38,415 --> 00:23:39,783
Hernando.

464
00:23:39,784 --> 00:23:41,985
Hey.

465
00:23:41,986 --> 00:23:43,153
I don't see anything.

466
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:44,421
Upper middle.
It's faint.

467
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:46,956
There's a word in the water.

468
00:23:51,028 --> 00:23:53,296
I'm getting nervous, Walter.

469
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:57,768
Hey, this is an ocean.

470
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,036
That's a boat.

471
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,305
<i>"Erkigsnek."</i>

472
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:04,141
He was near this boat.

473
00:24:05,176 --> 00:24:07,044
See you in a few.

474
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,111
I'll check the mailroom.

475
00:24:15,252 --> 00:24:17,454
Final cover.

476
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:20,190
Big responsibility.

477
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:22,025
Is that my quintessence?

478
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:23,827
This is... No.

479
00:24:23,828 --> 00:24:25,829
We're, um... we're prepping

480
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,865
the wetting agents
on that to start the process.

481
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,768
Really? Because it looks like
you're playing with toys.

482
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,971
No, this is...
this is a gift.

483
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,906
Yeah, um, the negative needs

484
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,474
to go through
a very technical...
I'm sorry.

485
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,843
I can't have a professional
conversation with you.

486
00:24:39,844 --> 00:24:43,447
You and your little blond pal.

487
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:45,849
Okay.
Let's...

488
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,951
You can't walk through
the office with him?

489
00:24:47,952 --> 00:24:50,187
Let's have it.
So I'll put it away.

490
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,156
Give me the toy, man.

491
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,423
No.
Now.

492
00:24:53,424 --> 00:24:55,259
Hey!
This is a place
of business,

493
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,294
not a place
of jelly-man toys.

494
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:58,462
Get off it!

495
00:24:58,463 --> 00:24:59,963
No, I'm taking it!

496
00:24:59,964 --> 00:25:01,932
You can't just take my stuff.

497
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,801
It's mine! Give it to me!
No!

498
00:25:17,414 --> 00:25:20,818
Stop fiddling with sweets
and little men!

499
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,520
I'm trying to do my job!

500
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:25,315
Are you the Tin Man?

501
00:26:25,316 --> 00:26:28,185
Need a little oilcan?

502
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:29,752
Jesus.

503
00:26:31,521 --> 00:26:33,457
Picture.

504
00:26:39,196 --> 00:26:40,430
Hello?

505
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:41,598
Hey!

506
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,933
Hey.

507
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,101
What's up?

508
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,602
Um, who is this?

509
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,104
Todd, from eHarmony.

510
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,405
Hi.

511
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,240
Yeah, when I lost
you there, I was saying

512
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:53,243
we need to beef your profile up,
make it, you know, not blank.

513
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:55,545
Real quick, let's build
your "Been There, Done Thats."

514
00:26:55,546 --> 00:26:57,180
Um, okay.

515
00:26:57,181 --> 00:27:00,083
Been there... um...

516
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:01,485
Phoenix.

517
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:03,120
I forgot why.

518
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,222
Then, Nashville,
but that was just the airport

519
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:07,457
on the way to Phoenix,
so I don't know if that...

520
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:09,293
Well, hey, man,

521
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,229
I was thinking,
if you work with this girl,

522
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,499
why don't you just, you know,
humanly invite her out?

523
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,200
No, no, no, I'm...
I'm trying to do,

524
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:19,970
like, a "Piña Colada Song" thing.
Piña... "Piña Colada Song"?

525
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,372
Yeah, you know, a guy posts
an ad looking for a lover,

526
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:23,540
and then his wife answers it,

527
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:26,476
and turns out they were soul
mates and didn't even know it,

528
00:27:26,477 --> 00:27:29,346
and they end up making love
in capes... or on a cape.

529
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:31,682
It-it's a song? Can you sing
a little bit, just...?

530
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,050
Yeah, you know...

531
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,521
You know that song?
I have to go.

532
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:38,522
Is that Hall & Oates?

533
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,457
Hey.
Hey.

534
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,692
Is that another clue?

535
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,527
Yeah. This one's okay.
Yeah?

536
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:46,229
There's a boat there, I think.

537
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,665
"Er... kig..."
"Snek."

538
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,400
<i>Erkigsnek?</i>
Yeah.

539
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:51,702
Sounds like a real clue.

540
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,036
Yeah, it's the boat's name.

541
00:27:53,037 --> 00:27:54,137
Have you Googled it?

542
00:27:54,138 --> 00:27:55,672
I was on my way to.

543
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:58,208
Yeah. N-U.

544
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:01,377
That's the, first two
letters of the port city.

545
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:04,147
Buffering.

546
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,117
So... the park.

547
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,319
I got to run up there
and pick up my son.

548
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,388
He's skateboarding with a friend.

549
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,689
Do you want to walk up with me?

550
00:28:14,658 --> 00:28:16,259
Starting now?

551
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,594
Yeah, starting now.

552
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:18,729
Okay.

553
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,364
Yeah, we got to figure this out.

554
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,465
It's a big deal.

555
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,567
You lost a Sean O'Connell.

556
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:25,469
Yeah, I used to work at Nabisco.

557
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,573
And then I had
a... change,

558
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:31,641
and I decided to apply to<i> LIFE.</i>

559
00:28:31,642 --> 00:28:33,143
Thought it would be

560
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,746
more colorful,
less regular, I guess.

561
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:38,682
You know, I just like
the idea of it.

562
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:41,251
Um, I like the motto
of the company.

563
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,319
Do you know it?

564
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,021
"To see the world..."

565
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,322
"Things dangerous to come to..."

566
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:46,656
"Things dangerous
to come to..." Yeah.

567
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:48,558
"To see behind walls..."
Yeah.

568
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,828
Yeah, I, um...
I got this from Sean.

569
00:28:54,598 --> 00:28:56,765
He gave this to you?
Yeah.

570
00:28:58,201 --> 00:29:00,669
I like that: "to draw closer."

571
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,175
So, what's he like in person?

572
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:06,743
Sean?
Yeah.

573
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:10,213
Well, I haven't actually met him.

574
00:29:10,214 --> 00:29:13,350
I... I mean,
we talk a lot, but I've...

575
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:16,186
I've been his point guy here
ever since I started.

576
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,755
How long ago was that?

577
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:21,358
16 years.
16 years?

578
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,759
My gosh. Wow.

579
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,561
Well, you have nothing
to worry about.

580
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,263
With the layoffs, I mean.

581
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,165
I've been here for a month.

582
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,233
"Last in, first out," right?

583
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:34,771
Sorry.

584
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:36,440
It's Rich's dad.

585
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,842
It's your...
Um...

586
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:41,745
Former... newly former.

587
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:45,182
But we've been sort
of... I don't know.

588
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,850
You know, I don't need to get it.

589
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,789
So, what kind of skateboard
does your son have?

590
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,358
Um, I have no idea.

591
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,127
It's oblong.
I don't know.

592
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,595
Why?

593
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:01,431
No, I just, um...
I used to...

594
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:03,400
I was kind of into the scene.

595
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,168
Like...

596
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:06,369
The skateboard scene?

597
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,405
Yeah.
Wow.

598
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,207
Hi, Peg.

599
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,541
Yeah, Sean O'Connell.

600
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:13,576
We actually, need to find him.

601
00:30:14,678 --> 00:30:16,680
Yes.

602
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,315
If you could hurry.

603
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,117
Kickflip.

604
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:21,518
Yeah.

605
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,154
It's a good one
for the repertoire.

606
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,555
I'm Walter.

607
00:30:25,556 --> 00:30:27,390
Rich.

608
00:30:27,391 --> 00:30:29,893
Yeah, we think he might know
something or have an asset we need.

609
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,428
You know, you just got to get

610
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,763
a little more snap,
get that thing up there.

611
00:30:33,764 --> 00:30:35,232
Want me to,

612
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,500
show you something?

613
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,467
Sure.

614
00:30:39,703 --> 00:30:41,471
Here.

615
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:43,607
Like your trucks.

616
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:46,376
Thanks.

617
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,778
Check this out.

618
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:50,180
Know about the flick?

619
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:55,251
Yeah, we-we-we've finished
processing his April work order.

620
00:31:01,591 --> 00:31:03,460
Yes, it's kind of important.

621
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:04,760
Okay.

622
00:31:06,329 --> 00:31:09,733
Did you forward the job 1090's?

623
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:12,836
Or his last salary?

624
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,337
Wow!

625
00:31:14,338 --> 00:31:15,704
Okay.

626
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:19,276
Wow.

627
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:20,610
Here you go.
That was awesome.

628
00:31:20,611 --> 00:31:22,479
So it could be either place.

629
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,613
Thanks, Walter.
Okay.

630
00:31:23,614 --> 00:31:25,782
Thanks, Peg.
All right.

631
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,884
Hey. So, um...

632
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:29,686
Sean's definitely
not in New York.

633
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,454
Peg said she sent multiples.

634
00:31:31,455 --> 00:31:33,690
I don't know if you know
how it works with him.

635
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:36,493
She sends copies 'cause we never
know where's he's going to be.

636
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:39,696
And this week, she sent 1090's
to Princeton, New Jersey.

637
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:41,932
Great. Train ride.

638
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,400
And one to Greenland.

639
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,768
Just in case.

640
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:47,637
Greenland, the country?

641
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:52,242
That's, um... you can't take
a train there.

642
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,643
No.

643
00:31:53,644 --> 00:31:55,545
Well, maybe he's in Jersey.
Yeah.

644
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,647
Yeah, is your phone done
buffering with that ship's name?

645
00:31:57,648 --> 00:31:59,316
Um, yes.

646
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:00,784
Look. Here it is.

647
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,786
Nuuk, Greenland.

648
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:03,987
That's...

649
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,655
Yeah.

650
00:32:05,656 --> 00:32:07,457
Come on, that's a good lead.

651
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,259
You should follow that up.

652
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,928
Yeah, follow it up in Greenland.

653
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:14,397
Yeah. Why not? Go.

654
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:15,999
Crack the case.

655
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,701
Listen to your wallet.

656
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:23,607
Sorry. It's my, um...
it's Phil again.

657
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,642
Um, maybe he fell
down a well or something.

658
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:26,743
Maybe I should get it.

659
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,278
Hey, buddy. Here.

660
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,980
Rich, Rich, Rich!
Not so fast. Here, here, here.

661
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:32,282
Take that. Take that.

662
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,550
Yeah.

663
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:34,985
I understand.

664
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,353
Okay.

665
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:37,854
Bye.

666
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,956
He did fall down a well.

667
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:41,958
But I don't care.

668
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:44,628
I just want to be with you,
you know?

669
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,729
Really?

670
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,397
Let's run away together.

671
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,432
Let's make every moment count,
starting now.

672
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:51,434
Sweet.

673
00:32:51,435 --> 00:32:52,969
Can I tell you something?

674
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,069
Anything.

675
00:32:55,705 --> 00:32:58,375
I have that
Benjamin Buttons thing.

676
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:02,012
Where you get old
but smaller or whatever

677
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:04,514
and become a gradual
old baby or something.

678
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:05,749
I didn't see the movie,

679
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,484
so I don't really know
how it works.

680
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,685
But I have it.

681
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:11,721
We can still build
a life together.

682
00:33:11,722 --> 00:33:13,389
Cool.

683
00:33:26,436 --> 00:33:28,938
I like your snappy little suit.

684
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:32,042
I bought it at a doll store.

685
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:35,011
Cool.

686
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:39,482
My little heart
is no bigger than a quarter,

687
00:33:39,483 --> 00:33:43,320
but it's as full as Fort Knox.

688
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,789
You're the bravest man
I've ever known.

689
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,791
I love you, baby.

690
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:51,027
Not like "baby," like,

691
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:55,497
because you look
like a little weird baby-man.

692
00:33:56,466 --> 00:33:57,767
I get it.

693
00:33:57,768 --> 00:34:00,904
Thank you for such
a wonderful life.

694
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:03,973
You're... I...

695
00:34:03,974 --> 00:34:05,108
Shh.

696
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:08,044
Just nestle in here and die.

697
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:12,949
Good-bye, Walter.

698
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,884
Good-bye, Walter.
<i>Bye! Walter!</i>

699
00:34:14,885 --> 00:34:16,586
Walter.

700
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:18,021
Walter.

701
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:19,589
Bye.
Sorry.

702
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,790
I was just...

703
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:22,726
Where do you go?

704
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,528
I-I started, thinking about...
No, it's okay.

705
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:27,797
I was probably boring you
about my broken refrigerator.

706
00:34:27,798 --> 00:34:30,066
No.
Rich!

707
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:32,969
My son's running into
the street. I-I have to go.

708
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,738
Yeah.

709
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,074
I wanted to tell you, um,
that song, "Major Tom,"

710
00:34:38,075 --> 00:34:40,143
back there,
when the beard guy was...

711
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,946
he doesn't know
what he's talking about.

712
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:47,584
That song is about courage
and going into the unknown.

713
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,251
It's a cool song.

714
00:34:52,922 --> 00:34:54,790
Rich!

715
00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:06,569
Yo.

716
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,772
Where's my thing?

717
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,807
It's in a silver bath.

718
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,844
I don't even know what language
you're speaking right now.

719
00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:16,713
You know, you got to
take me seriously.

720
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,581
I got a magazine to execute here.

721
00:35:18,582 --> 00:35:20,617
And bosses to answer to.

722
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,653
So next time I see you,
I see that picture. Okay?

723
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,922
Hey, dream machine.

724
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:28,458
Hello?

725
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,526
I just... I-I want proof
you heard me.

726
00:35:31,861 --> 00:35:33,896
Next time I see you...

727
00:35:34,864 --> 00:35:36,533
You see the picture.

728
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,901
That's right.

729
00:35:45,142 --> 00:35:47,477
Any luck, Hernando?

730
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,746
I turned the place
upside down... 25's not here.

731
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:51,847
I searched Receiving, too, man.

732
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:55,552
This never happens.

733
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,187
I'm telling you,

734
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,720
it's nowhere, Walter.

735
00:36:00,723 --> 00:36:03,860
I mean, maybe he didn't
even send it.

736
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:06,228
Maybe it's still on him.

737
00:36:07,797 --> 00:36:09,965
Walter?

738
00:36:35,058 --> 00:36:36,926
Walter!

739
00:38:35,945 --> 00:38:38,246
Hi.
Hi.

740
00:38:39,282 --> 00:38:41,116
Do you have any cars available?

741
00:38:42,085 --> 00:38:43,353
Yeah.

742
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,987
We have a blue one and a red one.

743
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:51,960
I'll take the red one.

744
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,990
Hi.
Hi.

745
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,391
Can I ask you...

746
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,760
Could-could someone
receive mail here?

747
00:39:57,761 --> 00:39:59,095
An American?

748
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:00,697
Sean O'Connell?

749
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,899
I think he might have
received mail at this address.

750
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,934
You want a drink?

751
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:08,371
Okay, yeah.
I guess...

752
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:13,276
A small beer shoe.

753
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:14,711
So-so could somebody

754
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:15,778
get mail here?

755
00:40:15,779 --> 00:40:18,047
Heli mail.
Heli mail?

756
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:19,716
We helicopter mail

757
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,784
to the ships when they pass by.

758
00:40:21,785 --> 00:40:23,886
We are pub and helipad.

759
00:40:23,887 --> 00:40:26,389
Yeah, wait, the, um,
the<i> Erkigsnek?</i>

760
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,057
Yeah,<i> Erkigsnek.</i>

761
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,292
<i>Erkigsnek.</i>

762
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:32,061
We flew mail to her Tuesday.

763
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,996
Gonna take it down a little here.

764
00:40:33,997 --> 00:40:36,799
I just want to speak
from the heart.

765
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,801
I lost a good lady.

766
00:40:38,802 --> 00:40:42,171
I feel this song is helping me
feel like I'm not alone.

767
00:40:42,172 --> 00:40:46,142
Even though I-I pretty much am.

768
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,844
Come on, let's sing it.

769
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,112
Everyone.

770
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,780
Let's sing it together.

771
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:54,917
So, do you know
who-who flies the mail out?

772
00:40:54,918 --> 00:40:56,953
Do you know... do you have,
like, regular pilots or...?

773
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,154
Hey, man.

774
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:59,455
Just keep going, man.

775
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:01,390
Hey, I'm...
Sing it.

776
00:41:01,391 --> 00:41:02,492
No, no, thank you.

777
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:03,793
I don't... I'm all right.

778
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,461
Come on, man, go on.
That's...

779
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:08,998
Yeah, I-I know.

780
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:10,533
I'm just, I'm okay.
Thank you.

781
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,002
I'm-I'm on a business trip.
I'm working.

782
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,904
Come on, man,
this song's important to me.

783
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,339
Yeah.

784
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,107
Yeah, I... Okay.
Sing it.

785
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,414
That sucked.

786
00:41:25,415 --> 00:41:27,083
Well... Okay.
Do your work.

787
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,985
You don't have to push.

788
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,486
Can you stop it? Don't poke me.
What if I poke you? What if...

789
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:31,988
Would you stop it?
Do your work, man.

790
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,489
Don't-don't poke me.
Do your work.

791
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,191
I'm poking you.
What am I doing? I'm poking you.

792
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:37,126
Stop, stop poking me.
Don't poke me!

793
00:41:39,896 --> 00:41:41,364
Hey!

794
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:42,565
Hey, stop!

795
00:41:43,867 --> 00:41:45,001
Come on!

796
00:41:49,539 --> 00:41:51,040
Wait! Wait!

797
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,375
Wait! Your thumb!

798
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:54,377
I have to talk to you
about your thumb!

799
00:41:59,048 --> 00:42:02,351
Yeah, I flew mail
out to the<i> Erkigsnek</i> Tuesday.

800
00:42:02,352 --> 00:42:04,921
Gave him a ride.

801
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:08,257
He took that photo
of my hand on the stick.

802
00:42:08,258 --> 00:42:10,426
I'm just...

803
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,560
blown away I located your thumb.

804
00:42:13,596 --> 00:42:15,398
There's, like,

805
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:17,465
eight people in Greenland.

806
00:42:19,435 --> 00:42:21,037
I mean, it's a...

807
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,406
It's a good place
to find a thumb.

808
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:27,844
Don't cheat on your lady, man,

809
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:31,147
when you live in a country that
only has eight people in it,

810
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:33,983
by the way.

811
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:35,852
So...

812
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,019
You're scrappy.

813
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,288
You're...

814
00:42:39,289 --> 00:42:41,424
You're a...
You're a little scrappy Duncan.

815
00:42:43,126 --> 00:42:45,394
So, you're trying
to find this guy.

816
00:42:45,395 --> 00:42:47,129
Yes, yeah.

817
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,465
Yeah, well, I'm flying
some radio parts out there

818
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:51,199
in, five minutes.

819
00:42:53,169 --> 00:42:55,303
He may still be on the boat.

820
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:57,940
Really?
Yeah.

821
00:42:57,941 --> 00:43:01,109
Maybe you could come with me.

822
00:43:08,017 --> 00:43:09,452
Yeah, or maybe I could...

823
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:12,121
just, you know, call him on the,

824
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:13,623
on the boat phone.

825
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:15,424
The boat phone?

826
00:43:15,425 --> 00:43:18,127
Yeah, the phone on the boat?

827
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:21,597
You mean the ship-to-shore?

828
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:23,366
Yeah, maybe I could just...
I could, you know,

829
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,201
I could ask him
on the ship-to-shore.

830
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:27,103
The radio's broke.

831
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:30,439
That's-that's why
I'm flying out there now.

832
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:34,210
You're flying out right now?

833
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:37,179
Just gonna finish my beer.
The weather doesn't look so great.

834
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,414
It's not.

835
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,516
Looks like there's a
storm moving in.

836
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:43,185
Yeah.

837
00:43:43,186 --> 00:43:44,520
A-brewin'.

838
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,122
Yeah.

839
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,990
You're just...
You're just gonna...

840
00:43:47,991 --> 00:43:49,992
finish your beer

841
00:43:49,993 --> 00:43:52,527
and then fly a machine?

842
00:43:55,965 --> 00:43:57,566
Yeah, kind of...

843
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:00,670
I'm kind of nervous
about the storm.

844
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:04,439
I just want to get a coup...
a couple of beers down.

845
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:16,385
Okay, I'm not gonna go with you.

846
00:44:16,386 --> 00:44:17,653
Okay?

847
00:44:17,654 --> 00:44:19,488
Yeah.

848
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:21,823
Whatever.

849
00:44:26,395 --> 00:44:28,197
See you, man.

850
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:30,366
Okay, see you.

851
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,434
Okay.

852
00:45:00,162 --> 00:45:01,697
Shut up!

853
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:19,348
Hi. Hello, everyone.

854
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:22,184
Hi...

855
00:45:22,185 --> 00:45:23,786
Hello, Nuuk.

856
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:26,855
Sorry, I'm a little nervous.

857
00:45:28,157 --> 00:45:30,092
Okay.

858
00:45:30,093 --> 00:45:33,029
This one goes out
to Walter Mitty.

859
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,031
He knows why.

860
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:02,912
Hey.

861
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:05,681
Glad you came.

862
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:07,249
You comfortable?

863
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:08,651
What?!

864
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,519
Are you comfortable?!

865
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,854
No!

866
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:14,055
Hold on tight!

867
00:48:18,527 --> 00:48:21,462
Hey! There she is!

868
00:48:36,745 --> 00:48:38,547
Where do we land?

869
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:40,349
We don't.

870
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,418
What?

871
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,352
We don't land.

872
00:48:57,299 --> 00:48:58,901
Okay, Walter.

873
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:01,770
I was gonna drop the radio parts
into the boat.

874
00:49:01,771 --> 00:49:04,472
You take them; they're
right next to you.

875
00:49:08,944 --> 00:49:10,346
These?
Yeah.

876
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:11,547
Just jump in the boat.

877
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:12,548
You got them?

878
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:13,582
Just jump in the boat?

879
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:14,817
Yeah!

880
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:17,486
Yeah, you're doing great, Walter.

881
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:19,922
What do you mean,
"jump into the boat"?

882
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:21,724
What would be the best way

883
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:24,026
of reaching you to stay in touch?

884
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:25,327
I don't know.

885
00:49:25,328 --> 00:49:26,662
Wait.

886
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:28,731
What do you mean,
"jump into the boat"?

887
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,933
It looks far away.

888
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,501
Yeah, but you got to go now.

889
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:35,670
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

890
00:49:37,273 --> 00:49:38,573
No!

891
00:49:39,508 --> 00:49:41,944
No, no, no, Walter!

892
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:43,612
I meant the other boat.

893
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:44,879
The little boat.

894
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,424
Help!

895
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,964
Help! Help!

896
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:03,832
Try to remain calm!

897
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:06,769
The pontoon boat
is coming for you.

898
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:10,039
You have at least a minute
before you freeze.

899
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,373
What?!

900
00:50:11,374 --> 00:50:12,540
You're safe.

901
00:50:18,514 --> 00:50:20,916
There's something here!

902
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:24,753
There's a fin here, I think!

903
00:50:24,754 --> 00:50:27,823
We are traveling
through a porpoise school.

904
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:30,392
Don't fear the porpoise.

905
00:50:30,393 --> 00:50:32,795
I don't think it's a porpoise!

906
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:35,664
I'm telling you, it's a porpoise.

907
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:37,833
Be friendly.

908
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:40,402
It will protect you
from the sharks.

909
00:50:40,403 --> 00:50:42,737
Okay!

910
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:47,343
Come here.

911
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:49,110
Hey.

912
00:50:50,546 --> 00:50:51,847
Hey.

913
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:53,749
Jesus!

914
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:57,119
Okay, that's a shark.

915
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,787
That's what I said!

916
00:50:58,788 --> 00:51:00,889
Jesus!

917
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:03,726
Stop befriending it!
Kill it!

918
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:07,596
It's not a porpoise!
It's not a porpoise!

919
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,565
Poke his eyes out!

920
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,599
Fight it!

921
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:20,576
My God, my God.

922
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,777
That really happened.

923
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:24,880
Real face.

924
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:26,882
Sorry for palming your face.

925
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:29,917
I just... My God.

926
00:51:39,395 --> 00:51:40,729
A pilot boat came.

927
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,998
They took him four hours ago.

928
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,900
Before the storm.

929
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:46,435
Took him where?

930
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,036
Iceland.

931
00:51:48,037 --> 00:51:49,671
Is...

932
00:51:49,672 --> 00:51:51,573
Is there any way
that we could radio him?

933
00:51:51,574 --> 00:51:52,941
I... It's very important

934
00:51:52,942 --> 00:51:54,810
that I discuss something
with him. I...

935
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:56,912
You jumped into the ocean
with our radio components.

936
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:58,647
They're lost.

937
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:00,549
Correct?

938
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,584
Yeah, that's correct.

939
00:52:09,825 --> 00:52:12,528
You're American?

940
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:14,163
Yeah.

941
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:15,898
Excellent.

942
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:17,599
Fonzie.

943
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:21,637
Come on, I'll-I'll find you
some dry clothing,

944
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,304
home slice.

945
00:52:28,143 --> 00:52:30,979
Will this work for your items?

946
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,114
Yeah.

947
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:33,449
Thank you.

948
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,083
Hey, I'll take this, buddy.

949
00:52:35,084 --> 00:52:36,718
Okay.
Hungry?

950
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:39,554
Sure.
I got some kick-ass cake, man.

951
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:44,126
Thank you.

952
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:45,727
Looking good.

953
00:52:45,728 --> 00:52:48,630
You can keep it.

954
00:52:48,631 --> 00:52:50,065
Hey, this is...

955
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:51,767
Is this...

956
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:53,502
This is clementine cake.

957
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,604
This is clementine cake;
my mom makes this.

958
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:57,805
Yeah, Sean brought it.

959
00:52:59,107 --> 00:53:00,909
Yeah.

960
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:02,977
Good.

961
00:53:16,825 --> 00:53:18,827
Is this Sean's?

962
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:21,096
Yeah, he wrapped the cake in it.

963
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:22,865
This is a shoot itinerary.

964
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:23,966
It's a field itinerary

965
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:26,034
for-for a photo...

966
00:53:26,035 --> 00:53:28,570
Did he say anything
about where he was going?

967
00:53:28,571 --> 00:53:30,239
No, he didn't say much.

968
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,509
He was just taking
pictures of these guys,

969
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:37,079
you know, the Chilean deckhands.
He even gave me some tips

970
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,814
for my Instagrams.

971
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:42,117
Facebook friends?

972
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:43,819
Yeah, sure.
Great.

973
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,988
What-what is... what is Eyjaf...

974
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:47,956
Eyjafallajokull?

975
00:53:47,957 --> 00:53:50,125
Eyjafjallajokull.
Excuse me?

976
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:51,593
Eyjafjallajokull.

977
00:53:51,594 --> 00:53:53,595
What is that?

978
00:53:53,596 --> 00:53:55,531
Well, it's in Iceland.

979
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:56,899
It's a volcano.

980
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,034
A volcano?
Yeah.

981
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:01,770
May 2, that's tomorrow.

982
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:03,105
Do you think there's any way

983
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:05,874
that we could possibly land
in Iceland?

984
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,109
Yeah.

985
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,610
Yeah?
Yeah.

986
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:09,945
We have to in the morning.

987
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:11,580
Great.

988
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,615
'Cause you lost the radio.

989
00:54:13,616 --> 00:54:14,917
Right, yeah, sorry.

990
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,986
I mean, sorry, but that's...

991
00:54:17,987 --> 00:54:19,755
Well, I-I-I just have
to get to Ey...

992
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,557
Eyjafjallajokull.

993
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:23,625
Right. Eyja...

994
00:54:23,626 --> 00:54:25,359
Man.

995
00:54:27,229 --> 00:54:30,131
Hey, I'll see you
on Sesame Street, man.

996
00:54:54,089 --> 00:54:56,325
Okay, you're here,

997
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:57,893
and this is Eyjafjallajokull.

998
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:59,294
It's, 15 kilometers.
All right, okay.

999
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:00,696
You can take the shore bike,

1000
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:03,065
but you better get going, man.

1001
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:06,101
Yeah, he didn't write
a time on that clue paper.

1002
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:07,868
No, man, hurry, because of...

1003
00:55:10,872 --> 00:55:13,308
What? I-I don't...
I don't understand.

1004
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:15,210
What he means, man,
is you have to hurry

1005
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:19,214
because there's a bunch of horny
Chileans who want to go to a strip club.

1006
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:20,682
There's only one bike.

1007
00:55:26,154 --> 00:55:28,657
Hurry, Walter, hurry, run!

1008
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:31,126
Go! Go!

1009
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:35,296
Stay gold, Pony Boy!

1010
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,797
Hello?

1011
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:43,832
Hey, what's up?

1012
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:46,101
Todd? From eHarmony?

1013
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:48,303
Yeah, yeah, what's up, man?

1014
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:49,771
Not much.

1015
00:56:49,772 --> 00:56:51,139
How have you been?

1016
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:52,774
Good.
It's, it's early here.

1017
00:56:52,775 --> 00:56:53,875
I just got up, man.

1018
00:56:53,876 --> 00:56:55,110
I was thinking about you.

1019
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:56,211
Where are you?

1020
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:57,779
Los Angeles.

1021
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:00,148
Hey, so your profile

1022
00:57:00,149 --> 00:57:01,883
still hasn't received any winks

1023
00:57:01,884 --> 00:57:03,785
even though I put
that you've been to Phoenix.

1024
00:57:03,786 --> 00:57:07,389
I, I jumped
out of a helicopter yesterday

1025
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:11,193
into the ocean
and had a shark fight.

1026
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:13,295
Yeah, yeah, listen,
I was mentioning before,

1027
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:16,164
people who daydream too much,
they're not content...

1028
00:57:16,165 --> 00:57:17,933
No, it was real.
I really did.

1029
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,000
Really?

1030
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:20,335
I'll put down adrenaline junkie.

1031
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:22,404
Well, what kind of a shark?
Was it like a...

1032
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:25,207
Hey, Todd,
I can't really talk right now.

1033
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:26,808
I'm on my way to a volcano.

1034
00:57:26,809 --> 00:57:28,477
What the...?

1035
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:34,509
Hey. Hi.

1036
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:38,045
Hey, you guys...
you guys speak English?

1037
00:58:39,981 --> 00:58:42,083
I'm looking for Eldgos Street.

1038
00:58:42,084 --> 00:58:43,151
Eldgos?

1039
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:45,887
Is that a street?

1040
00:58:45,888 --> 00:58:47,956
Is this Eyjafjallakuta?

1041
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:49,157
Eyjafjallakuta?

1042
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:51,293
Something like that?

1043
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:54,129
Eyyafallakuta?
Eyyaflutakuta?

1044
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,496
Eyftu...

1045
00:59:00,001 --> 00:59:01,536
It's a longboard.

1046
00:59:01,537 --> 00:59:02,938
Yeah.

1047
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:04,139
Is that... What is that?

1048
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,240
Is that, like, Thor or...?

1049
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:06,441
Odin?

1050
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:08,910
Like, a Norse god?

1051
00:59:08,911 --> 00:59:10,010
It's cool.

1052
00:59:11,446 --> 00:59:15,250
Hey, would you...

1053
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:17,419
Would you maybe want
to make a trade?

1054
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,653
I know a kid who would
love that board.

1055
00:59:22,558 --> 00:59:24,159
It's cool.
Look, he stretches.

1056
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,328
Here, come and check it out.

1057
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:31,266
Yeah, he's fun.

1058
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:34,001
Yeah, lots of stretching fun.

1059
00:59:39,341 --> 00:59:40,541
Want to do it?

1060
00:59:49,184 --> 00:59:50,552
Yeah?

1061
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:52,487
Great, great, thank you.

1062
01:00:10,372 --> 01:00:12,439
Hello?

1063
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:21,249
Hello?

1064
01:00:27,489 --> 01:00:30,258
Hi. Hi.

1065
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:32,928
Hey, do you...
do you speak English?

1066
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:34,162
The hotel is closed.

1067
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:37,999
Okay, yeah, um, I'm just...

1068
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,601
I'm trying to find this guy,

1069
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:42,037
this man, Sean O'Connell.

1070
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:44,105
I think that he possibly,
he might have stayed here.

1071
01:00:44,106 --> 01:00:45,674
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1072
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:47,142
I got a plane for him.

1073
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:48,710
At 1:00, there.

1074
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:50,178
15 minutes.

1075
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:52,580
He's at airfield
in Stykkisholmur.

1076
01:00:52,581 --> 01:00:54,449
Yeah, yeah, in the valley,
next town south.

1077
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:56,551
Okay, where is it?
Stykkisholmur.

1078
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:58,486
Tickishoumer.

1079
01:00:58,487 --> 01:01:00,121
Is it straight down that way?

1080
01:01:01,657 --> 01:01:04,426
Okay, thank you!

1081
01:01:06,028 --> 01:01:07,561
It's all right! I know him!

1082
01:03:51,193 --> 01:03:52,594
What's going on?
Where is everybody?

1083
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:53,728
Eldgos!

1084
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:54,729
Come, Eldgos!

1085
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,564
Eldgos. Eldgos.
Yes, yes!

1086
01:03:56,565 --> 01:03:57,832
What-what does that mean?
Eretion.

1087
01:03:57,833 --> 01:04:00,635
Eretion?
Erection.

1088
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:02,303
Erection?
Yes! No!

1089
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:04,672
Eruption!

1090
01:04:04,673 --> 01:04:05,907
Eruption?
Yes.

1091
01:04:18,853 --> 01:04:20,654
Sean.

1092
01:04:37,906 --> 01:04:39,707
Faster! Go faster!

1093
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:44,312
Holy shit! Faster!

1094
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:48,749
My God!

1095
01:05:09,337 --> 01:05:11,739
Thanks for coming back for me.

1096
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:14,242
I really appreciate it.

1097
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,610
I hope you find your man.

1098
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:16,611
Thanks.

1099
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:18,446
Yeah, there's a motel

1100
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:19,746
near the pizza place there.

1101
01:05:25,286 --> 01:05:27,354
Good luck.

1102
01:06:13,935 --> 01:06:15,336
Photographic Accounts.

1103
01:06:15,337 --> 01:06:16,437
Cheryl?

1104
01:06:16,438 --> 01:06:17,605
This is Cheryl Melhoff.

1105
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:18,940
Hey, it's Walter. Mitty.

1106
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:22,010
Hey, I walked down
to say hi to you

1107
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:23,945
about an hour ago
and you weren't there.

1108
01:06:23,946 --> 01:06:25,446
That's 'cause... guess what.

1109
01:06:25,447 --> 01:06:27,415
I'm in Iceland.

1110
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:28,816
Iceland?

1111
01:06:28,817 --> 01:06:30,918
Wait, w-wasn't it Greenland?

1112
01:06:30,919 --> 01:06:32,854
Yeah, yeah, it was.

1113
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:34,889
: You know that
they're not the same place?

1114
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,557
No, no, no,
I-I went to Greenland,

1115
01:06:36,558 --> 01:06:38,893
and then I got
on a fishing vessel

1116
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:42,063
tracking Sean, and...
and ended up here in Iceland.

1117
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:43,631
You're in Iceland.

1118
01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:45,900
Yeah, at a Papa John's.

1119
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:48,670
Hey, I got more clues.

1120
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:49,771
What-what did you find?

1121
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:52,507
There's a date that Sean wrote

1122
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:54,976
and some words on a cake wrapper.

1123
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:57,812
"Rajqawee," "Buzkashi"

1124
01:06:57,813 --> 01:06:59,380
and, "Warlocks."

1125
01:06:59,381 --> 01:07:01,082
Wait, they have
a Papa John's in Iceland?

1126
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:03,818
Yeah, I just had to...
just left.

1127
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:06,054
Did you get kicked out?

1128
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:07,889
No, I just needed to leave.

1129
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:10,992
Just the atmosphere and the...

1130
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:13,394
cups.

1131
01:07:13,395 --> 01:07:15,663
Hey, I was right on Sean's trail.

1132
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:17,598
Then I lost him.

1133
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:19,500
Strong little man.

1134
01:07:19,501 --> 01:07:21,602
Thanks.

1135
01:07:21,603 --> 01:07:25,640
No.<i> Rajqawees</i> means
strong little man

1136
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:27,675
in, like, 40 Arabic countries.

1137
01:07:27,676 --> 01:07:31,112
And<i> Buzkashi</i> is goat hockey

1138
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:32,980
in Central Asia.

1139
01:07:32,981 --> 01:07:36,084
And, "Warlocks..."

1140
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:40,688
Yeah, um, I was hoping
they would connect.

1141
01:07:42,424 --> 01:07:45,526
So you said
that you left Papa John's

1142
01:07:45,527 --> 01:07:47,095
because of the cups?

1143
01:07:47,096 --> 01:07:49,831
Is there something I should
be aware of as a customer?

1144
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:52,533
No, I just, I worked there,

1145
01:07:52,534 --> 01:07:53,968
that's all. I just...

1146
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:57,105
I used to have a Mohawk and,

1147
01:07:57,106 --> 01:07:58,840
a backpack,

1148
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:01,843
and I guess this idea
of who I wanted to be

1149
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:04,712
and what I wanted to do.

1150
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:06,981
And...

1151
01:08:06,982 --> 01:08:08,416
Yeah?

1152
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,485
Nothing, just...

1153
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:14,989
Just, I was pretty close
with my dad,

1154
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:18,726
and he died when I was 17

1155
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:20,528
on a Tuesday,

1156
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:22,029
and we didn't have any savings,

1157
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:25,733
so I got a haircut that Thursday,

1158
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:27,769
and, a job,

1159
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,603
the same Thursday.

1160
01:08:30,872 --> 01:08:33,007
Papa John's?

1161
01:08:33,008 --> 01:08:34,608
Yeah.

1162
01:08:36,778 --> 01:08:38,980
Your dad let you have a Mohawk?

1163
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:41,983
He shaved my head.

1164
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:45,453
That's a good dad move.

1165
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:47,455
Yeah.

1166
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:50,124
Is it nice there?

1167
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:52,093
Yeah, it is.

1168
01:08:52,094 --> 01:08:53,428
It's...

1169
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:56,063
It's really beautiful.

1170
01:08:56,064 --> 01:08:57,632
Well, it's pretty sucky here.

1171
01:08:57,633 --> 01:09:00,535
Human Resources has already started
letting some of the staff go,

1172
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:02,703
so it'll be a lot different
when you get back.

1173
01:09:02,704 --> 01:09:05,839
Hey, I picked something up for...

1174
01:09:07,475 --> 01:09:09,543
I think I lost you.

1175
01:09:11,078 --> 01:09:13,714
You know what, I'll catch
you up when I see you.

1176
01:09:13,715 --> 01:09:15,082
Great.

1177
01:09:15,083 --> 01:09:16,651
Okay, all right.

1178
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:17,819
I'll... Okay.

1179
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,120
Um, okay, bye, Walter.

1180
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:21,187
Bye, Cheryl.

1181
01:10:02,497 --> 01:10:03,865
What's going on?

1182
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,700
All the way in.
All the way to the back.

1183
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:07,735
They shut down two floors.

1184
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:10,303
Why do you look rugged?

1185
01:10:12,573 --> 01:10:14,242
I see you.

1186
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:17,011
Hey! I see you!

1187
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:18,145
What did I say?

1188
01:10:18,146 --> 01:10:19,847
I see you.

1189
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:21,516
The photograph.
Now. Let me see it.

1190
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:22,950
He looked it up.

1191
01:10:22,951 --> 01:10:24,986
There's no such thing
as a "silver bath."

1192
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:26,621
Listen, there was uncertainty
about the negative.

1193
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:28,122
I thought...

1194
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:29,657
I understood that, hopefully,
it was in Iceland...

1195
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:30,958
It was in your care!

1196
01:10:30,959 --> 01:10:32,627
If you just give me
some more time...

1197
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:34,829
You're fired.
We'll make another cover.

1198
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:35,996
Hey!

1199
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:42,270
More than a million... way more...
negatives have come through my office.

1200
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:43,838
I have never mislaid one.

1201
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:45,573
Put it on a plaque.

1202
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,275
Hang it at your next job.

1203
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:49,277
Now I got to explain
this to the board?

1204
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:51,879
Yeah, I'm sure Sean
O'Connell will be thrilled.

1205
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,714
Hey...

1206
01:10:53,715 --> 01:10:55,750
Tell me again...
who is this guy?

1207
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:57,118
You okay?

1208
01:10:57,119 --> 01:10:59,554
Yeah.

1209
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:01,055
That's cool.

1210
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:02,757
It's a skateboard.

1211
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,924
It's for Cheryl's son.

1212
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:08,162
Cheryl's not in.
She was let go.

1213
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:11,098
I told you, man, it's bad.

1214
01:11:11,099 --> 01:11:12,298
Hey! That's my fern.

1215
01:11:13,334 --> 01:11:14,401
Thank you.

1216
01:12:06,053 --> 01:12:09,456
Hi.
Hi.

1217
01:12:11,225 --> 01:12:12,492
Can I...?

1218
01:12:14,261 --> 01:12:16,964
Yeah, is, um...

1219
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:19,367
Is this, um...
I'm looking for Cheryl Melhoff.

1220
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:21,102
You want Cheryl?

1221
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:24,739
Yeah. She's, um...

1222
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:27,074
We work together,
and she was, she was

1223
01:12:27,075 --> 01:12:30,043
helping me with a, um,
with a work thing that...

1224
01:12:32,179 --> 01:12:33,847
Cheryl?

1225
01:12:35,783 --> 01:12:38,085
Honey?

1226
01:12:38,086 --> 01:12:40,054
There's some guy here.

1227
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:42,289
What?

1228
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:44,258
Shh!
Bud, stop it.

1229
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:46,093
From work.

1230
01:12:46,094 --> 01:12:48,461
Um, okay, hold on.
I'm on the phone.

1231
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:14,755
It's Conan.

1232
01:13:14,756 --> 01:13:17,291
Tonight,
First Lady Michelle Obama,

1233
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:19,894
Walter Mitty!

1234
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:21,762
Can we... can we talk
about your love life?

1235
01:13:21,763 --> 01:13:23,230
I think people would be interested.
I don't think...

1236
01:13:23,231 --> 01:13:24,932
You don't want to know
about my love life.

1237
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:26,867
I think they do.

1238
01:13:26,868 --> 01:13:28,402
Yeah, I think
they do. Yes.

1239
01:13:28,403 --> 01:13:30,771
Now, I don't believe
everything I read.

1240
01:13:30,772 --> 01:13:32,173
There's a scandal?

1241
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:33,441
Little...
little scandal?

1242
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:35,810
A little scandal, yes.

1243
01:13:35,811 --> 01:13:38,913
She was back with her
husband or something...

1244
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,448
then she fell for you?

1245
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:41,782
You know, where there's smoke,
there's fire.

1246
01:13:41,783 --> 01:13:44,185
That's all I'm gonna say.
You're awesome, Walter.

1247
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:46,187
Well, thanks. Hey, thanks.
Sure.

1248
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,222
I don't think
Can you turn this off?

1249
01:13:48,223 --> 01:13:50,224
You realize I am bumping
It stays on.

1250
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:53,327
Dame Judi Dench 'cause I want
to talk to you more.

1251
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:55,929
I'm just going to get out.

1252
01:14:10,177 --> 01:14:13,380
Hey, Mom.
Hi, honey.

1253
01:14:13,381 --> 01:14:15,416
Walter, you gotta tip these guys.

1254
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:17,485
We got the piano back safe, Mom.

1255
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:20,788
You back from your work trip?

1256
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:22,389
Yeah, this morning.

1257
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:23,390
Hungry?

1258
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:27,228
I'm making soup.
Thanks.

1259
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:29,049
Hey, tipping time now.
: Let's go.

1260
01:14:34,935 --> 01:14:36,469
This is all I got.

1261
01:14:39,073 --> 01:14:40,808
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1262
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:42,143
All right, thanks, everybody.

1263
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:43,511
For all your hard work.

1264
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:44,512
Yeah. We appreciate it, ma'am.

1265
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:45,513
You did great.

1266
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:47,281
You just let yourself out.

1267
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:49,142
- He's good for this.
- What'd I tell you?

1268
01:14:51,152 --> 01:14:52,386
You gonna stay for dinner?

1269
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:54,255
Mom, I'd love to.

1270
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:55,823
I think I'm just really wiped out

1271
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:57,491
after supervising moving
that thing all day.

1272
01:14:57,492 --> 01:15:00,828
I think I just need to go
to yoga and then just crash.

1273
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:02,163
What is it? A class?

1274
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:04,165
Yeah, it's yoga.
It's a class.

1275
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,367
I go to the hot kind,
where they heat the room.

1276
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:08,502
Have you heard of that?
Sure.

1277
01:15:08,503 --> 01:15:09,837
You have?
It's good for you.

1278
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:11,038
It's great for you.

1279
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:12,506
You just get it
all out of your system.

1280
01:15:12,507 --> 01:15:13,874
You just get all your sweat out,

1281
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:15,376
you just get everything,
all your fear.

1282
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:17,278
I'm waiting on a call
about an audition, and I just...

1283
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:18,379
Ooh, that<i> Grease</i> show?

1284
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:19,880
Yeah.
Rizzo?

1285
01:15:19,881 --> 01:15:21,115
Yeah. I'm really
excited about it.

1286
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:22,349
I haven't even heard of that.

1287
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:24,251
But I just
gotta get it... I just...

1288
01:15:24,252 --> 01:15:25,519
what's good about this is that
I just don't worry about it.

1289
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,520
Just get out of my head.

1290
01:15:26,521 --> 01:15:28,189
Is that good, too?

1291
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,924
I feel like it's good
in a class like this.

1292
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:32,393
I mean, I'm not going to get
paid for it, which is fine.

1293
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:34,028
It's not about money.
Wonderful.

1294
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,496
And I feel like, you know,

1295
01:15:35,497 --> 01:15:37,164
it's just for kids,

1296
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:40,034
but I think it's important
for them to start early.

1297
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:41,368
I'm really thrilled, Mom.

1298
01:15:41,369 --> 01:15:43,871
You know, I think I'm just
going to enjoy it.

1299
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,573
Just standing in front
of people and talking.

1300
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:48,209
You'll be
good at that.
Yeah.

1301
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,311
You'll really be good at that.
I think so, too, Mom.

1302
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:53,447
- Hey, Mom?
- Yeah.

1303
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:57,550
Did somebody take a picture
of your piano, like, a week ago?

1304
01:16:00,254 --> 01:16:02,189
I did.

1305
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:03,556
With Sean's camera.

1306
01:16:08,128 --> 01:16:09,496
Sean O'Connell's camera?

1307
01:16:09,497 --> 01:16:11,264
Yeah, he came to visit.

1308
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:13,968
Mom, what?

1309
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:16,237
Yeah.

1310
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:18,172
He wanted to know about
your work schedule,

1311
01:16:18,173 --> 01:16:20,207
when you left,
when you came home.

1312
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:22,576
He said you really
understood<i> LIFE.</i>

1313
01:16:22,577 --> 01:16:24,578
He was really interested
in your work.

1314
01:16:24,579 --> 01:16:26,513
You...

1315
01:16:26,514 --> 01:16:28,349
Mom, why didn't you tell me?

1316
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:29,483
I told you.

1317
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:31,218
I told you in the produce aisle.

1318
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:33,654
I remember that.

1319
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:35,356
Maybe you were...

1320
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:37,157
Odessa, what is it you call it

1321
01:16:37,158 --> 01:16:39,226
when he goes into
one of his little places?

1322
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:41,128
Zoned out.

1323
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:43,229
You do that now and then.

1324
01:16:44,498 --> 01:16:46,132
What's the matter?

1325
01:16:47,935 --> 01:16:50,371
I got fired.

1326
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:52,239
I lost a picture of his.

1327
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:54,108
Can you find it?

1328
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,377
No, I don't know where he is.

1329
01:16:56,378 --> 01:17:00,547
He's some... someplace
with warlocks or...

1330
01:17:00,548 --> 01:17:03,217
Warlords.

1331
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:04,985
No, warlocks.

1332
01:17:04,986 --> 01:17:06,654
No. Warlords.

1333
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:10,324
Sean said he had to meet
with warlords very soon,

1334
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:13,160
and maybe he would take my cake

1335
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:14,662
so that he could get permission

1336
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:17,264
to trek through
the wilds and places.

1337
01:17:17,265 --> 01:17:19,266
He said he wants to
photograph snow leopards.

1338
01:17:19,267 --> 01:17:20,401
How about that?

1339
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:21,734
Who?

1340
01:17:30,377 --> 01:17:33,746
"Ungoverned Afghanistan."

1341
01:17:36,951 --> 01:17:39,019
That's where Sean is.

1342
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:42,189
Crazy Afghanistan.
Yeah.

1343
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:44,992
In the upper Himalayas.

1344
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:47,494
They can't let you go.

1345
01:17:47,495 --> 01:17:50,998
You were Sean's partner.

1346
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:53,100
He told me that you
were the person

1347
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:54,668
who worked the hardest

1348
01:17:54,669 --> 01:17:58,805
to make sure his work was
realized the way he wished.

1349
01:18:03,177 --> 01:18:06,245
You finish his work.

1350
01:21:47,267 --> 01:21:48,435
Hey, Todd.

1351
01:21:48,436 --> 01:21:50,237
Hey, what's up?

1352
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:51,638
Not much.

1353
01:21:51,639 --> 01:21:52,839
Hey, good news.

1354
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:55,409
Your profile
really rounded out, man.

1355
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,411
That-that volcano-shark combo.

1356
01:21:57,412 --> 01:21:58,645
That is money in the bank.

1357
01:21:58,646 --> 01:22:00,547
Get ready to get a lot of winks.

1358
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:01,815
Okay.

1359
01:22:01,816 --> 01:22:03,517
But, um, something else.

1360
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:04,885
Cheryl Melhoff...

1361
01:22:04,886 --> 01:22:06,787
she's not on here anymore.

1362
01:22:06,788 --> 01:22:08,522
Withdrawn.

1363
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:10,524
Really?

1364
01:22:10,525 --> 01:22:11,525
Yeah.

1365
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:13,527
Hey, man, where are you now?

1366
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:14,695
Himalayas.

1367
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:16,296
The Himalayas.

1368
01:22:16,297 --> 01:22:18,432
I love it.
Wait a minute...

1369
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:19,900
that is a kick-ass "Been There."

1370
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:21,835
Todd, I'm gonna keep this short.

1371
01:22:21,836 --> 01:22:23,904
I have to make oxygen choices.

1372
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:25,839
Hey, I get it. Go!

1373
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,874
Anyway, you have a profile now.

1374
01:22:27,875 --> 01:22:29,676
Congratulations.

1375
01:22:29,677 --> 01:22:31,712
Cool, but... you know what?

1376
01:22:31,713 --> 01:22:33,013
Would you take me off?

1377
01:22:33,014 --> 01:22:35,515
I can't really
swing that $500 yearly.

1378
01:22:35,516 --> 01:22:36,950
Hey.

1379
01:22:36,951 --> 01:22:39,586
Um... well...

1380
01:22:39,587 --> 01:22:41,488
Hey, man.

1381
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:42,789
You're sure?
'Cause I feel like

1382
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:44,458
we're really onto something here.

1383
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:47,461
I mean, this is...
Do you mind?
I'm working.

1384
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:49,596
This is one of the best
profiles I've ever done, and...

1385
01:22:49,597 --> 01:22:50,998
and our refund policy, well,
you know, we don't have one...

1386
01:22:50,999 --> 01:22:52,565
Todd, I gotta go.

1387
01:22:55,335 --> 01:22:56,336
Sean.

1388
01:22:56,337 --> 01:22:58,404
Yeah.

1389
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:05,811
It's... it's Walter.

1390
01:23:10,617 --> 01:23:12,485
Mitty.

1391
01:23:21,361 --> 01:23:22,496
Walter Mitty.

1392
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:24,563
Seriously?

1393
01:23:26,833 --> 01:23:29,369
How the hell did you get up here?

1394
01:23:29,370 --> 01:23:31,570
I just...

1395
01:23:35,309 --> 01:23:37,843
I've been looking for you.

1396
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:42,982
Sit down.

1397
01:23:47,754 --> 01:23:49,822
I'll sit.

1398
01:23:57,531 --> 01:23:58,699
Well, take your time.

1399
01:23:58,700 --> 01:23:59,733
Settle in.

1400
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:01,634
Try to be real still, okay?

1401
01:24:03,036 --> 01:24:06,773
There's a snow leopard.

1402
01:24:06,774 --> 01:24:08,707
Right in this ridge.

1403
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:12,946
So we have to try to be
very, very, very, very still.

1404
01:24:16,817 --> 01:24:19,051
They call the snow leopard
the "ghost cat."

1405
01:24:21,588 --> 01:24:23,489
It never lets itself be seen.

1406
01:24:28,528 --> 01:24:30,596
Ghost cat?

1407
01:24:33,633 --> 01:24:36,469
Beautiful things don't
ask for attention.

1408
01:24:42,709 --> 01:24:45,645
Sean, there was a...

1409
01:24:45,646 --> 01:24:49,716
negative that got
separated from your roll.

1410
01:24:49,717 --> 01:24:53,120
I'm taking a lot
of heat over it at work.

1411
01:24:53,121 --> 01:24:57,090
It never came with
the roll that you sent.

1412
01:24:57,091 --> 01:24:59,459
The last roll
you're talking about?

1413
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:01,160
Yeah.
The 25.

1414
01:25:02,996 --> 01:25:04,830
Yeah.

1415
01:25:05,832 --> 01:25:08,634
You're sitting on it.

1416
01:25:10,837 --> 01:25:13,840
Why am I sitting on it?

1417
01:25:13,841 --> 01:25:16,943
It's in your wallet.

1418
01:25:16,944 --> 01:25:18,745
That was the gift.

1419
01:25:18,746 --> 01:25:20,914
The photograph.

1420
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:22,983
The wallet was just something
I could put it in.

1421
01:25:22,984 --> 01:25:24,684
So I put it in a little slot,

1422
01:25:24,685 --> 01:25:26,887
the little picture
holder in there.

1423
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:29,555
I thought it'd be cute.

1424
01:25:31,024 --> 01:25:32,926
I told you, "Look inside."

1425
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:35,162
In the note.

1426
01:25:35,163 --> 01:25:36,763
You said, "Look inside."

1427
01:25:36,764 --> 01:25:38,498
I thought you meant,
I thought you meant

1428
01:25:38,499 --> 01:25:40,033
look inside
of the wrapping paper.

1429
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:43,103
Yeah? Well, you got a real
nice surprise coming.

1430
01:25:43,104 --> 01:25:44,905
No, I don't have it.

1431
01:25:44,906 --> 01:25:47,541
I don't have it anymore.

1432
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:49,643
Whoa.

1433
01:25:54,614 --> 01:25:56,715
What the hell were you thinking?

1434
01:25:58,552 --> 01:25:59,920
I mean, I-I'm sorry,

1435
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:01,955
I've admired you
for a very long time,

1436
01:26:01,956 --> 01:26:04,524
but that is not
a good move, at all,

1437
01:26:04,525 --> 01:26:05,859
with a valuable negative.

1438
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:08,695
Sorry, I just...
I-I thought it would be

1439
01:26:08,696 --> 01:26:10,630
a playful kind of thing.

1440
01:26:10,631 --> 01:26:13,133
Playful?

1441
01:26:13,134 --> 01:26:15,067
Too playful.

1442
01:26:16,036 --> 01:26:17,838
I see what you're saying.

1443
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:20,574
With the cover, I should have
been more straightforward.

1444
01:26:20,575 --> 01:26:23,275
But can I ask you?
I mean, if you don't mind...

1445
01:26:24,578 --> 01:26:26,513
what did you do with the wallet?

1446
01:26:26,514 --> 01:26:29,214
Chucked it.

1447
01:26:30,984 --> 01:26:32,785
Well, that hurts my feelings.

1448
01:26:34,554 --> 01:26:36,823
No... man, I liked it
very much.

1449
01:26:36,824 --> 01:26:38,091
I appreciated it very much.

1450
01:26:38,092 --> 01:26:39,226
So you threw it away?

1451
01:26:39,227 --> 01:26:41,093
I...

1452
01:26:42,229 --> 01:26:46,132
So you have no idea what it was.

1453
01:26:46,133 --> 01:26:48,734
The photograph.

1454
01:26:51,972 --> 01:26:53,706
It's a shame.

1455
01:26:55,909 --> 01:26:58,911
It was a beauty.

1456
01:27:14,027 --> 01:27:15,996
How'd you find me, anyway?

1457
01:27:19,666 --> 01:27:21,735
My mom.

1458
01:27:21,736 --> 01:27:22,903
Cool lady.

1459
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:24,971
Knows how to bake.

1460
01:27:24,972 --> 01:27:27,039
Yeah.

1461
01:27:28,642 --> 01:27:30,010
Hey, why did you...?

1462
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:31,977
Shh.

1463
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:09,715
When are you gonna take it?

1464
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:16,256
Sometimes I don't.

1465
01:28:16,257 --> 01:28:18,692
If I like a moment...

1466
01:28:18,693 --> 01:28:24,264
I mean, me, personally...

1467
01:28:24,265 --> 01:28:26,999
I don't like to have
the distraction of the camera.

1468
01:28:31,037 --> 01:28:34,440
I just want to stay... in it.

1469
01:28:38,345 --> 01:28:40,212
Stay in it?

1470
01:28:41,648 --> 01:28:44,250
Yeah, right there.

1471
01:28:44,251 --> 01:28:46,351
Right here.

1472
01:28:49,623 --> 01:28:51,490
Now it's gone. It's gone.

1473
01:28:58,098 --> 01:28:59,699
That looks like fun.

1474
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:01,066
I think I'm gonna jump in.

1475
01:29:02,302 --> 01:29:05,338
Hey, what-what was
the picture, Sean?

1476
01:29:05,339 --> 01:29:09,374
We're going to be odd-numbered
if you don't join.

1477
01:29:10,677 --> 01:29:13,013
What was the picture?

1478
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:16,683
Let's just call it
a ghost cat, Walter Mitty.

1479
01:31:04,858 --> 01:31:06,226
You made the watch list.

1480
01:31:06,227 --> 01:31:08,128
How'd you get to Afghanistan?

1481
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:09,362
There's a travel ban.

1482
01:31:09,363 --> 01:31:12,297
Through Yemen.

1483
01:31:13,366 --> 01:31:15,368
Violent place.

1484
01:31:15,369 --> 01:31:18,838
That's why
the air fare's only $84.

1485
01:31:18,839 --> 01:31:21,340
Can I have my fife back?

1486
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:25,378
Do you know
anyone in Los Angeles?

1487
01:31:25,379 --> 01:31:27,313
No.
Any acquaintances? Okay.

1488
01:31:27,314 --> 01:31:29,082
Any companions?

1489
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:30,850
Anybody here
who might be able to verify

1490
01:31:30,851 --> 01:31:32,384
that you're Walter Mitty?

1491
01:31:42,395 --> 01:31:44,397
Walter Mitty?

1492
01:31:44,398 --> 01:31:45,832
Yeah.

1493
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:48,968
Todd Maher, eHarmony.

1494
01:31:48,969 --> 01:31:51,004
Hey.

1495
01:31:51,005 --> 01:31:52,906
Thank you.

1496
01:31:52,907 --> 01:31:54,440
Thanks. I really...
What?

1497
01:31:54,441 --> 01:31:56,075
Come here, come here.

1498
01:31:56,076 --> 01:31:58,411
Backpack.

1499
01:31:58,412 --> 01:32:00,880
Big hug!

1500
01:32:00,881 --> 01:32:02,248
Airport prison?

1501
01:32:02,249 --> 01:32:03,449
Yeah.
Yeah?

1502
01:32:03,450 --> 01:32:05,251
Tell me all about it
over a Cinnabon.

1503
01:32:05,252 --> 01:32:07,120
Come on, Cinnabon.

1504
01:32:08,422 --> 01:32:09,923
<i>How long were you</i>

1505
01:32:09,924 --> 01:32:12,425
detained for, by the way?

1506
01:32:12,426 --> 01:32:14,260
Like, 17 hours.

1507
01:32:14,261 --> 01:32:15,995
Wow.

1508
01:32:15,996 --> 01:32:17,197
How's that Cinnabon taste?

1509
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:19,132
Really great.
That's like...

1510
01:32:19,133 --> 01:32:21,000
That's frosted heroin.
That's what you're eating.

1511
01:32:21,001 --> 01:32:23,069
My friend, that's what you're
having right there, man.

1512
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:24,304
It's good.

1513
01:32:24,305 --> 01:32:25,605
By the way,

1514
01:32:25,606 --> 01:32:27,173
you got 300 winks

1515
01:32:27,174 --> 01:32:29,209
before I took down your profile.

1516
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:31,077
Three... in, like,
the space of two hours.

1517
01:32:31,078 --> 01:32:32,278
It was crazy.

1518
01:32:32,279 --> 01:32:34,147
I thought I was selling
concert tickets.

1519
01:32:34,148 --> 01:32:36,282
I never checked.

1520
01:32:36,283 --> 01:32:38,518
Because of the,

1521
01:32:38,519 --> 01:32:41,321
the-the piña colada girl
that quit?

1522
01:32:41,322 --> 01:32:43,156
Yeah.

1523
01:32:43,157 --> 01:32:45,290
Yeah, Cheryl.

1524
01:32:46,459 --> 01:32:48,294
Cheryl, who...

1525
01:32:48,295 --> 01:32:50,196
did not respond to a single wink

1526
01:32:50,197 --> 01:32:52,298
the whole time she was on there.

1527
01:32:52,299 --> 01:32:54,267
That's a choosy lady.

1528
01:32:57,571 --> 01:33:00,240
How's the,

1529
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:03,742
daydreaming going?

1530
01:33:05,879 --> 01:33:08,114
Lately, less.

1531
01:33:08,115 --> 01:33:10,416
Good.

1532
01:33:10,417 --> 01:33:12,352
Less is good.

1533
01:33:12,353 --> 01:33:14,520
Thanks for the pastry.

1534
01:33:14,521 --> 01:33:16,623
Yeah, well, you owe me.

1535
01:33:16,624 --> 01:33:19,291
I'll send you a check
as soon as I sell the piano.

1536
01:33:20,627 --> 01:33:23,396
You have a lot on your plate.

1537
01:33:23,397 --> 01:33:26,165
What are you gonna do now?

1538
01:33:26,166 --> 01:33:28,266
Go out and get another job.

1539
01:33:32,372 --> 01:33:34,439
Boom.

1540
01:33:35,608 --> 01:33:38,278
I'm sorry, Walter, I just...
What?

1541
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:40,246
You are so not
how I pictured you.

1542
01:33:40,247 --> 01:33:43,082
What-what?
How-how did you picture me?

1543
01:33:43,083 --> 01:33:45,485
I pictured you
as a little gray piece of paper,

1544
01:33:45,486 --> 01:33:47,520
but now I see you

1545
01:33:47,521 --> 01:33:50,390
and it's like Indiana Jones
decided to become

1546
01:33:50,391 --> 01:33:52,959
the lead singer of the Strokes
or something like that.

1547
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,027
It's nuts, I know.

1548
01:34:14,681 --> 01:34:16,449
Sorry, Mom.

1549
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:17,984
What for?

1550
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:19,619
Dad bought it for you.

1551
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:21,120
It was my responsibility.

1552
01:34:21,121 --> 01:34:23,022
Walter.

1553
01:34:23,023 --> 01:34:24,424
We're all grown here.

1554
01:34:24,425 --> 01:34:26,525
We're all good.

1555
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:51,284
Ooh, that's heavy-duty,
that sum.

1556
01:34:51,285 --> 01:34:53,319
You should put this
in your wallet.

1557
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,121
I don't have one.

1558
01:35:05,064 --> 01:35:06,399
Found it in the trash.

1559
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:09,334
I always save your knickknacks.

1560
01:35:14,707 --> 01:35:16,341
Thanks.

1561
01:35:18,444 --> 01:35:20,413
Got it, Mom?
Got it.

1562
01:35:20,414 --> 01:35:22,481
Watch the stairs.

1563
01:36:06,459 --> 01:36:08,194
I think this works.

1564
01:36:08,195 --> 01:36:09,762
Heart of America,
different generations,

1565
01:36:09,763 --> 01:36:11,364
this says it all.

1566
01:36:11,365 --> 01:36:13,366
Hey, welcome.

1567
01:36:13,367 --> 01:36:15,735
Wait, I'm sorry, not welcome,

1568
01:36:15,736 --> 01:36:17,770
not an employee.

1569
01:36:17,771 --> 01:36:19,838
Sorry.

1570
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:26,711
There's the picture
Sean wanted... 25.

1571
01:36:29,849 --> 01:36:32,851
You have two days
to print for cover.

1572
01:36:34,854 --> 01:36:36,922
There's your quintessence.

1573
01:36:40,693 --> 01:36:42,727
Hey.

1574
01:36:44,397 --> 01:36:46,431
Do you know our motto?

1575
01:36:48,868 --> 01:36:51,304
<i>LIFE.</i>

1576
01:36:51,305 --> 01:36:53,905
I'm lovin' it.

1577
01:36:55,274 --> 01:36:57,210
That's... no.

1578
01:36:57,211 --> 01:36:59,344
That's-that's McDonald's.

1579
01:37:01,848 --> 01:37:03,716
This thing that you do,

1580
01:37:03,717 --> 01:37:05,351
Ted, where you come into a place

1581
01:37:05,352 --> 01:37:06,718
and you push people out...

1582
01:37:08,387 --> 01:37:10,156
you should know that those people

1583
01:37:10,157 --> 01:37:12,324
worked really hard
to build this magazine.

1584
01:37:14,227 --> 01:37:16,762
They believed in the motto.

1585
01:37:16,763 --> 01:37:18,898
And I get it,
you got your marching orders,

1586
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:22,335
and you have to do
what you have to do,

1587
01:37:22,336 --> 01:37:25,870
but you don't have
to be such a dick.

1588
01:37:28,508 --> 01:37:30,443
Put that on a plaque

1589
01:37:30,444 --> 01:37:32,677
and hang it at your next job.

1590
01:37:44,590 --> 01:37:45,725
What was it?

1591
01:37:45,726 --> 01:37:47,593
Sasquatch? A unicorn?

1592
01:37:47,594 --> 01:37:48,594
The negative?

1593
01:37:48,595 --> 01:37:49,795
Yeah.

1594
01:37:49,796 --> 01:37:51,330
I didn't look.

1595
01:37:56,903 --> 01:37:58,970
You were a good boss, Walter.

1596
01:38:01,207 --> 01:38:02,707
Thanks, man.

1597
01:38:06,612 --> 01:38:08,513
Thanks.

1598
01:39:21,621 --> 01:39:22,888
Hey, Walter, what's up?

1599
01:39:22,889 --> 01:39:24,923
Check this out.

1600
01:39:36,902 --> 01:39:38,904
See you!

1601
01:39:38,905 --> 01:39:40,972
Hi.

1602
01:39:52,451 --> 01:39:54,519
Walter Mitty, severance package.

1603
01:40:36,495 --> 01:40:38,431
Hey!

1604
01:40:38,432 --> 01:40:40,098
Cheryl!

1605
01:40:41,801 --> 01:40:43,936
Hey.
Hey. Hey.

1606
01:40:43,937 --> 01:40:46,339
I got that e-mail
from Rich yesterday.

1607
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:47,673
He's really good.

1608
01:40:47,674 --> 01:40:49,508
Walter, thank you.

1609
01:40:49,509 --> 01:40:50,776
That was... that...

1610
01:40:50,777 --> 01:40:54,046
that was just
a really cool thing to do.

1611
01:40:54,047 --> 01:40:56,782
I just saw it in Iceland.

1612
01:40:56,783 --> 01:40:59,518
He loves it, and I'm
taking him this afternoon.

1613
01:40:59,519 --> 01:41:00,952
Cool.

1614
01:41:02,421 --> 01:41:04,790
Hey, I wanted you to know

1615
01:41:04,791 --> 01:41:06,826
you weren't boring me.

1616
01:41:06,827 --> 01:41:08,960
That day in the park...

1617
01:41:10,129 --> 01:41:11,663
I-I was...

1618
01:41:12,531 --> 01:41:13,933
I was thinking about...

1619
01:41:13,934 --> 01:41:15,868
I hope this doesn't
sound weird, but...

1620
01:41:15,869 --> 01:41:18,203
I was thinking about you.

1621
01:41:19,805 --> 01:41:23,476
When I was in Greenland...
they do karaoke there,

1622
01:41:23,477 --> 01:41:26,946
and I had to get
on this helicopter

1623
01:41:26,947 --> 01:41:29,115
with a very drunk pilot,

1624
01:41:29,116 --> 01:41:32,952
and I started to imagine you

1625
01:41:32,953 --> 01:41:35,186
singing "Major Tom."

1626
01:41:37,723 --> 01:41:40,593
Anyway,

1627
01:41:40,594 --> 01:41:42,728
it got me on the helicopter,

1628
01:41:42,729 --> 01:41:44,830
and it just...

1629
01:41:44,831 --> 01:41:47,599
got me where I wanted to go.

1630
01:41:49,535 --> 01:41:50,970
So what happened to you?

1631
01:41:50,971 --> 01:41:54,473
You sort of fell
off the face of the earth there

1632
01:41:54,474 --> 01:41:56,509
for a little bit.

1633
01:41:56,510 --> 01:41:58,144
I came by, and I...

1634
01:41:58,145 --> 01:42:01,881
your husband answered,
so I figured I should just go.

1635
01:42:01,882 --> 01:42:03,582
Phil.

1636
01:42:03,583 --> 01:42:05,918
He was fixing my refrigerator,

1637
01:42:05,919 --> 01:42:08,587
and he's not my husband.

1638
01:42:08,588 --> 01:42:11,756
I guess I imagined that...

1639
01:42:13,125 --> 01:42:15,995
I thought maybe you
got back together.

1640
01:42:15,996 --> 01:42:18,564
You have a good imagination,

1641
01:42:18,565 --> 01:42:20,632
but no.

1642
01:42:22,568 --> 01:42:25,137
Hey, my sister got
this role in<i> Grease.</i>

1643
01:42:25,138 --> 01:42:26,939
Rizzo.

1644
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:29,741
Not on Broadway;
in some weird church.

1645
01:42:31,610 --> 01:42:34,814
Do you want to go with me?

1646
01:42:34,815 --> 01:42:36,615
I made that sound
really not good, but...

1647
01:42:36,616 --> 01:42:37,749
Yeah.

1648
01:42:38,717 --> 01:42:40,186
Yeah?

1649
01:42:40,187 --> 01:42:41,620
Yeah, yeah.

1650
01:42:41,621 --> 01:42:43,189
I would love to.

1651
01:42:43,190 --> 01:42:44,890
<i>Grease</i> in a weird church?

1652
01:42:44,891 --> 01:42:46,592
You kidding?

1653
01:42:46,593 --> 01:42:48,894
Rizzo, that's...
that's the best part.

1654
01:42:48,895 --> 01:42:50,763
Yeah, Rizzo.

1655
01:42:50,764 --> 01:42:52,131
Tough and tender.

1656
01:42:52,132 --> 01:42:54,066
Yeah.

1657
01:42:54,067 --> 01:42:55,901
Great.

1658
01:42:55,902 --> 01:42:58,137
Are you... are
you heading uptown?

1659
01:42:58,138 --> 01:43:00,139
Sure.

1660
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:01,940
Yeah?
Yeah.

1661
01:43:03,509 --> 01:43:05,811
I actually always
related to Rizzo more.

1662
01:43:05,812 --> 01:43:07,179
Yeah?
Yeah.

1663
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:10,115
Was it the, smoking
and the teenage sex?

1664
01:43:10,116 --> 01:43:13,152
No, she was just real, I guess.

1665
01:43:15,055 --> 01:43:16,889
The last issue,
it should be here.

1666
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:19,257
It came out this morning.

1667
01:43:38,811 --> 01:43:40,878
Man, Walter.

1668
01:44:00,099 --> 01:44:02,167
Should we go buy one of those?

1669
01:44:02,168 --> 01:44:03,969
Yeah, I was probably gonna...

1670
01:44:03,970 --> 01:44:06,272
Probably gonna go back later?
Yeah, yeah.

1671
01:44:06,273 --> 01:44:10,108
I just didn't want to seem
uncool and get one right away.
