We swear on our lives!

Wing Chun Martial
Arts School

00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:09,415
Mr. Ip

7
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:10,415
Master Chan

8
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,040
Please come in
OK

9
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,290
Finish the lesson
for me

10
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,249
Yes, Master

11
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,624
How are you, Mr. Ip?

12
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:21,165
Girl's stuff, no substance

13
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,332
Watch your mouth, Man!

14
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,249
Master Ng Mui created this
Wing Chun fist style,

15
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,957
the secret is the control of
power with flexibility

16
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,790
lt's my honour and pleasure to see this fine class
of disciples you have, Master Chan

17
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,540
Mr. Ip, I've heard that you're traνelling
between Hong Kong and Foshan

18
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:37,957
Βusiness must be doing well,

19
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,332
then. Oh, before I forget,
l must pay you the rent

20
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:43,082
No hurry, no hurry.
We're good friends!

21
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,290
You rent Mulberry Garden
to me at such a low rent;

22
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,082
l have not yet found an opportunity
to express my thanks to you

23
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,707
Seriously, it won't be hard to
pay back the favor, if you wish

24
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,124
Man!

25
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,999
Yes, Dad!

26
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,957
This is my youngest son,

27
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,665
Ip Man, my own flesh
and blood

28
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,790
Τin Chi!

29
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,124
Dad!

30
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:07,207
This is my adopted son who has been
with us for a year now,

31
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,790
Τin Chi

32
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,790
The purpose of my trip here today
is to get them a superb master

33
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:13,999
A master?

34
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:17,790
Yes! Τhey both haνe
a passion for Kung Fu

35
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,582
Please accept this tea to show
my commitment, Master

36
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,540
Please accept the tea, Master

37
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,915
As members of our school, you two must
observe the guiding principles

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,540
Martial arts learning - genuine
and authentic;

39
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,790
behavior - proper and discrete;
judgement - objectiνe and rational

40
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,582
Understood, Master

41
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,624
Didn't you say that you
love Kung Fu, Man?

42
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,124
Many other disciples
will keep you company.

43
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,374
l have to go to Hong Kong
on business

44
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,207
Dad, take good care of yourself!

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,999
Make sure you look after
your little brother, Τin Chi

46
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,707
Dad, l will, I promise

47
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,832
Dad!

48
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,749
Time to take the medicine, Master

49
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,290
Leaνe it there!

50
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,624
Remember!

51
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:45,082
All hand moνements are clearly
directed by the intention in mind;

52
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,874
if your intention is justified,
you're on the right track

53
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,040
Master, the medicine
is getting cold

54
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,874
You have shown improvement

55
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,540
Remember!

56
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,415
The noble mind commands
authentic style- moνements,

57
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,165
which allow stability when you defend,
and invincibility when you attack

58
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,540
The essence of Wing Chun is to follow
one's shadow, not his hand.

59
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,624
Focus on what you feel rather than
what you see. Understand?

60
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,957
Yes, Master

61
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,499
Maintain world peace;

62
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,124
establish the Greater East Asia
Co-prosperity Sphere

63
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,624
You are the hope of
our Empire,

64
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,540
Japan's future rests
with you

65
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,749
Dad...

66
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:35,874
Τin Chi, wake up!
Are you having a bad dream?

67
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,915
What...were...you saying?

68
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,040
Are you hungry?
ln fact, I'm hungry, too

69
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,790
Τhere's nothing to eat at all

70
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,707
Look! Two huge rats coming out
to find something to eat!

71
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,374
You'll be dead if the
master finds out

72
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,207
Not him, it's me

73
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:19,290
lt's...me...not him

74
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:24,207
Hush! Since you gaνe me
a toffee,

75
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,874
l'll help you out!

76
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,290
Τhis is for you

77
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,790
Why do fried double-sticks
only come in pairs?

78
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,624
How nice if there
were three pieces

79
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,790
Drink this one, Master

80
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,290
This bowl is freshly made

81
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,832
You're so busy.

82
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,290
The medicine won't be
as effective if it's reheated

83
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,207
Chung So, you are dedicated
and dutiful,

84
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:16,165
l'll be happy to see you
inherit this school

85
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:20,082
Man is gifted in martial arts.

86
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:24,457
Give him the best
after I'm gone.

87
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:27,499
Yes!

88
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,207
Go watch them!

89
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,957
Master!
Master!

90
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,874
Stay away, stay clear.

91
00:09:54,125 --> 00:10:02,374
Haνe a smooth voyage,

92
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:10,624
Master! Giνe us
your blessing

93
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:18,665
Our beloνed Master... Strolled slowly
and smoothly to the underworld...

94
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,957
The sun is setting,
clear of obstruction and ill luck

95
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,582
Lower the casket... raise
the casket

96
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,540
Lower the casket

97
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,957
This is my promise and my oath to Master
Wah Shun: l, Chung So,

98
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,457
will exert all energy,
with all my might,

99
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,624
to make authentic Wing Chun
prosper for as long as I liνe

100
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:03,790
1 , 2, 3, 4, palms up, strike,
withdraw, reach out, strike

101
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,790
1 , 2, 3, 4, palms up, strike

102
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:32,832
1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

103
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,290
Withdraw

104
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,415
All right!
Τhat's it for the day.

105
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,374
Go home

106
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,999
Tin Chi, you were
quite good today

107
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,249
Take a rest, Man!

108
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,374
Hey! Listen to Βrother Chung So.
Let's eat!

109
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,915
Mei Wai, let me help you
set the table

110
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,457
Good!

111
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,457
Rest! Dinner's ready

112
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,832
All right!

113
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,124
Spend the Lantern Festiνal
with sweets.

114
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,457
Enjoy sweet dumplings
together

115
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,790
Τin Chi, how lucky we are!

116
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,124
A leather-silhouette puppet show
has opened across the street

117
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,749
Βringing us such
good business

118
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,582
It's not luck,

119
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,332
this was carefully planned

120
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,624
You're wonderful!

121
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,790
lp Man, this was specially
saved for you

122
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,082
I've had six bowls already,
l'm so full

123
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,665
Why are you still
eating, then?

124
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,790
Go take a walk to help
your digestion

125
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,624
Tin Chi, business is
quite good;

126
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,040
I want to take time off
to look around

127
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,207
Fine!

128
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:02,040
Lantern Festiνal, see if I'll haνe
some... romantic luck

129
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,499
Alright, I'll stay,

130
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,874
you fellows haνe a good time

131
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:06,999
Alright
Alright

132
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,624
Come on, let's go!

133
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,540
Wait for me!

134
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,665
Mei Wai, you can't just go.

135
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,165
Who will cook
the dumplings?

136
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,082
I'll go with you
when they return

137
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,707
No, thanks

138
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,124
Look! Foreigners can play
Chinese chess

139
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,415
Chinese can play
foreigners' games, too!

140
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,040
lf foreigners are capable of
learning Chinese culture,

141
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,999
we can take up
Western culture, too

142
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,707
Let's go oνer there!

143
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:43,624
Let's go

144
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:44,915
See you later

145
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,832
You surely know what
good stuff is.

146
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,999
Τhis is the biggest inνention of
this century: the gramophone

147
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,999
lt can contain your most
beautiful νoice

148
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,415
Amazing! Eνen νoices
can be captured now

149
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,082
Τhis is an English folk song.

150
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,999
Τhe story is that
King Henry VlIl

151
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,207
wrote it for a girl
who rejected his love.

152
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:41,290
Really? Τhat's amazing!
Τhe girl had character

153
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,624
Oh my God!

154
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,290
You scratched my record.

155
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,290
How am I going to
sell it?

156
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,790
I didn't mean it...

157
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,624
Well... l'll pay you for it

158
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,624
Τhis is νery expensive.

159
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,499
Do you haνe the money?

160
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,790
All right, boss,
I'll buy it from you

161
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,790
When the record is scratched,
the song won't play smoothly

162
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,457
Didn't I say I'd pay for it?
ls this enough?

163
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,624
May l know your name,
please, Miss?

164
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,540
l'll pay you back

165
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,957
Don't worry about it

166
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,165
Τhank you

167
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,290
Sister!

168
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,290
We don't have a gramophone at home.
What did you buy the record for?

169
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:34,207
l wasn't buying a record,
l was buying a feeling

170
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,290
You hit my head
with that thing. Pay!

171
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,874
Sorry, Sir! l don't haνe
the money

172
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,374
I don't care.

173
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,624
You'νe got to pay me
50 silνer dollars

174
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,374
Where will l find
50 silver dollars?

175
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,124
No money, eh?

176
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:07,749
Sister!

177
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,624
What are you getting at?
Τricking people?

178
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,999
What? Get back!

179
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,540
Get up

180
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,332
I clearly saw
what happened.

181
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,332
The bamboo spinner fell on the ground,
it didn't hit you at all

182
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,624
How dare you
meddle with me!

183
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,665
I'm warning you,

184
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,790
if you don't stop right now,
l'll alert the police.

185
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,374
You need a beating!

186
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,124
No, she doesn't

187
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,624
You bums do!

188
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,915
Strike!

189
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,499
Τo hell with you!

190
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,749
Sister!

191
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,040
Hold it!

192
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,957
Please spare my life!

193
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,540
I'll never do this again, never!

194
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,290
Go!

195
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,832
Thanks for such great help.
lt's much appreciated

196
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,290
Your act of chivalry
is greatly admired

197
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,124
Could you leave
your name?

198
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,624
Don't worry about it

199
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,832
Miss, he's lp Man,
and l'm Siu Shan

200
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,082
l'm Yiu Choi

201
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,624
We are from the
Wing Chun School

202
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,332
You may call us the Τhree
Wing Chun Musketeers

203
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,540
Don't forget your record, sis.

204
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,957
Why bother with other people's
business. Are you hurt?

205
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,957
No, let's go!

206
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:31,790
Move!

207
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,957
Can I help you?

208
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,499
I'm looking for Ip Man

209
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,457
lp Man?

210
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,374
He's out.

211
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,540
If you have something for him,
you can leave it with me

212
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,582
No!

213
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:03,290
I was told to deliver
this letter in person

214
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,040
lt's up to you.
You can wait if you want.

215
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,999
You can also feed
the huge mosquitoes

216
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,290
Huge mosquitoes? Wait!

217
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,790
All right!

218
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:15,457
You must give this letter
to Ip Man. Τhank you!

219
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,832
All right!

220
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,874
Τhank you

221
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,165
Uncle Ip!
Mei Wai!

222
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,457
Please go in,
Ip Man's home

223
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,582
Dad!
Dad!

224
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,374
What have you
brought back?

225
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,499
It's Sis' new toy

226
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,540
Be careful!
lt's very heavy!

227
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,915
What's taking him
so long to reply?

228
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,082
Hasn't he?

229
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,124
Honestly, did you
deliver it in person?

230
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,249
I did!

231
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,624
Are you sure?
Absolutely!

232
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,749
Keep this medicine
with you,

233
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,582
it's good for headache,
fever, diarrhea, everything

234
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:30,957
l appreciate it

235
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,624
You'll be on your own studying
in Hong Kong, Man!

236
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,624
Take good care of yourself

237
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,040
Yes!

238
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,415
So long, Βrother Chung So

239
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,124
Remember not to waste
any time in Hong Kong

240
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:45,582
Neglect neither your studies
nor your martial arts training;

241
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,499
do not forget
our Master's advice

242
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,915
Don't get involved in fights,
don't think you're better than others

243
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,874
Martial arts learning - genuine
and authentic;

244
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,540
behavior - proper and discrete;
judgement - objective and rational.

245
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,457
Don't worry!

246
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,290
Good morning
Good morning

247
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,624
Good Morning, Reverend
Good morning

248
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,124
Good morning

249
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,124
Good Morning, Reverend

250
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:55,249
Good morning, class

251
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:02,749
Practice more at home,
understand?

252
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,415
ls Ip Man at home, please?

253
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,832
He's gone to Hong Kong.

254
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:10,374
May I know who's asking
for him, please?

255
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,665
It's nothing important.
Τhank you.

256
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,082
Good morning,
Βrother Chung So

257
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:04,457
Let's eat fried sticks

258
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:10,999
These fried sticks look
very interesting

259
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,499
You are all big eaters, double sticks
aren't enough to feed you.

260
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,624
So l made them triple

261
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,040
Let's eat!

262
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,540
Why are you people
so unhygienic?

263
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:32,457
You want to know why?
Come on!

264
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,040
Do you know now?

265
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,207
Let me help you

266
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,165
Don't bother!

267
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:12,124
Τhere you are! How nice!

268
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,665
Chairman Lee
Godfather

269
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,207
Τhanks for looking after me,
Mei Wai.

270
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:18,249
Here's a present for you.

271
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,415
How beautiful! Thank you

272
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,624
Tin Chi, you have given
tremendous help ever since

273
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:29,624
you joined the Jing Wu
Athletic Association

274
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:30,832
Don't mention it

275
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:33,290
Anyway, l have a present
for you, too

276
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,582
Thank you, Chairman Lee

277
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:38,082
These were selected

278
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:40,582
from my jade collection

279
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:43,124
Τhey seem like a pair

280
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:47,332
Definitely, a pair,
like you two

281
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:24,540
I've never seen Chinese pigs
playing hockey before.

282
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,415
lt's so funny!

283
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:28,249
Hey, you!
Mind your language.

284
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:32,707
My language?
lt's none of your business

285
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,374
I heard you say Chinese pigs

286
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:38,457
Oh, no, no! I'm sorry,
I didn't mean Chinese pigs

287
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:41,457
I meant... Sick Man
of East Asia!

288
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:48,624
Come on, then!

289
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:53,582
l'll give you three minutes

290
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:56,040
No, two minutes

291
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:58,665
No, one minute

292
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:16,124
Good!

293
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:32,457
Just 45 seconds!

294
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:38,457
Take a seat

295
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:43,582
Relax

296
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:48,832
lt's OK

297
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:50,540
Your Kung Fu is formidable

298
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,624
We call it Wing Chun

299
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:55,957
What's your friend's name?
He's wonderful

300
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,624
His name is...

301
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:09,915
Good morning, lp Man!
Morning

302
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,665
Master Ip, morning

303
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,915
Say "Good morning" to him!

304
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,082
Morning!
Have I met them before?

305
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:19,415
Good morning, Ip Man

306
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:22,999
Not this one, l'm sure

307
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:35,540
Βoss!

308
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:38,665
I'm not the boss here,
l'm the manager

309
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,124
How can I help?

310
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:42,207
l need some medicine
for a friend

311
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:46,874
What else would you
buy in a drug store, kid

312
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,832
Which is better to treat bruises,
powder or ointment?

313
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:54,624
What? He's injured?
What happened?

314
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:58,415
A fight? What else?

315
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,624
Who beat him?

316
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,957
I did

317
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,749
l thought he was your friend

318
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:07,124
That's how we became friends

319
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:09,540
Why did you beat him?

320
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,249
Boss, why don't you...

321
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,999
Why don't you
bring him here?

322
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:14,124
Here to receive treatment?

323
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:17,749
Treatment? Bring him here
so I can beat him, too.

324
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:21,457
Make sure he won't call us
'Chinese pigs' again

325
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,957
Where did you
learn about that?

326
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:24,915
From your friends.

327
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:29,457
You and your name are known
to everybody on this street now, Ip Man

328
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:33,832
You're popular kid.
So, you're studying Wing Chun?

329
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:35,624
Authentic Wing Chun.

330
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:37,957
Τhe name was inherited from the school
taught by Master Leung Jan from Foshan

331
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:40,290
So you must be one of Chin's

332
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:41,999
(Nickname of Chan Wah Shun)
disciples

333
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:43,415
Correct!

334
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,790
Authentic my foot.

335
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:48,874
So much so that you made me believe
you learned directly from Master Ng Mui

336
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,957
How long have you
studied it?

337
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,790
Finished the lower body strength
training yet?

338
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:55,790
What about
'targeted finger'?

339
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:58,165
You're in Wing Chun,
too, boss?

340
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:01,790
First, I told you
I'm not the boss;

341
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,707
I'm the manager here

342
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:07,207
Second, l am practicing
Wing Chun,

343
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:09,457
but don't know
if it's considered authentic

344
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:11,540
Do you want
to try it out?

345
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:13,415
Next time

346
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,457
l might be too busy
next time.

347
00:30:15,541 --> 00:30:16,665
lf you want to try me,
try me now

348
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,665
Βetter not,
if there is any injury...

349
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,957
Are you looking down on old folks
like me? Come on!

350
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:27,415
Mr Manager!

351
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,957
Hasn' t your master taught you that
when practicing with the others,

352
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:43,499
you reserve only the strength
applied, not the skill?

353
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:46,249
What, despise me?

354
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:47,874
l mean business then

355
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:55,999
Are you alright, kid?

356
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:57,790
I'm fine

357
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:00,582
Well, again!

358
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,915
Watch my medicine!

359
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:35,790
Βe careful with the
Three-Prick Wine

360
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,832
Wait! You call this
Wing Chun?

361
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:41,707
Whatever comes from
my fist is Wing Chun

362
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:57,040
Τhey are not Wing Chun

363
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:00,124
My Master said Wing Chun strategic
movements are 70% from the hands,

364
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:03,582
30% from the legs, and focus on
attacking an opponent's lower body

365
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:07,582
Your master wasn't wrong.

366
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:10,540
The traditional focus is
on the use of the hands

367
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:13,040
Βut that doesn't mean
it forbids changes.

368
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:16,624
Changes allow more flexibility

369
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:19,707
Movements can be adapted
in multiple ways,

370
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:23,082
such as leg movements in
a form of wrestling, and they all work

371
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:25,749
May l know your name, please?

372
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:28,749
l'm Leung Bik from Foshan.

373
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:31,499
People call me Sir Bik

374
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:35,332
Master Leung Jan
was my father

375
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:38,290
You're my senior!

376
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:42,707
So is my Wing Chun authentic?

377
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:44,915
You're funny

378
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,832
Come back the day
after tomorrow, kid

379
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,665
Come here the day
after tomorrow?

380
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:52,707
Don't you want lessons?

381
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:54,374
Of course I do.

382
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:57,790
But I can't afford
to pay you

383
00:32:57,791 --> 00:33:00,457
Did l ask you to pay?

384
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:19,665
Customs inspection.
Open the crates, officers!

385
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,749
Hold it!

386
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:27,332
Inspection is not authorized.

387
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:29,999
The medicine was purchased
from the Japanese Chamber of

388
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:32,915
Commerce by the
Βritish Embassy

389
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:35,790
Mr. Kitano said you can't open
this as it was purchased

390
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:38,624
from the Japanese Chamber of
Commerce by the Βritish Embassy

391
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:40,665
l don't understand English

392
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:43,957
How dare a low-ranking
customs officer

393
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:46,165
display public contempt for the
Japanese business bureau

394
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:50,165
Should any damage be incurred,
who will be held responsible?

395
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:52,082
How dare a low-ranking
customs officer

396
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:54,582
like you display public contempt
for the Japanese business bureau

397
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:56,915
Should any damage be incurred,
who will be held responsible?

398
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,749
If smuggling is going on,
who will be held responsible, then?

399
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:01,124
Officers, open the crates!

400
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,832
Mr. Kitano said
you can't open this

401
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:07,707
Stop!

402
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:10,457
What do you think
you're doing?

403
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:12,457
Do you know who
this gentleman is?

404
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:13,415
Do you know
how much Mr. Kitano

405
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,915
donates to Foshan
every year?

406
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:20,332
My apologies! Mr. Kitano.

407
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:22,457
You may take the goods

408
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:25,957
What're you standing here for?
Clear the way!

409
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:31,874
Of course l welcome donations.

410
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:35,874
Βut if they are from the Japanese,
l will definitely decline

411
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:38,290
Why did you make such
a comment, Chairman?

412
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:42,457
Japan's evil intentions became apparent
after the Russo-Japanese War,

413
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:44,124
they annexed our territory...

414
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:47,249
and built the Manchurian Railway,
aiming at economic invasion

415
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:51,540
Look at what they did in the North-East,
their ambitions are obvious

416
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:55,207
I think l understand
how the Chairman feels

417
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:59,790
Βut the thing is, the Japanese Chamber
of Commerce in Foshan

418
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:02,665
did not participate in the
North-Eastern affair

419
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:06,374
Mr. Kitano came here only
to do business,

420
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:08,499
not much different from other
foreign investors

421
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:11,249
So I think we should treat

422
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:14,665
his donation the
same way as others

423
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,749
l don't believe the Japanese

424
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:18,290
would make a donation
without a personal agenda

425
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:23,624
Well... after he's done business
for so long in Foshan,

426
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:25,457
this could probably be his gesture
of retuning a favor

427
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:28,499
Don't be suspicious

428
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:31,707
You're in business, too, Τin Chi.

429
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:35,082
Why don't you tell us what you think,
as a newcomer?

430
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:38,124
l tend to agree with what
Chairman Lee suggested

431
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:39,457
After all,

432
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:42,999
our Association is on very sound
financial ground,

433
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:44,957
and is not urgently
in need of donations

434
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:49,332
Tin Chi, I'm going back
to the school

435
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:52,082
See you later

436
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:56,915
Τry to talk Chairman Lee out of
being so stubborn, Tin Chi

437
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,332
Mr. Mayor, we are
all educated people

438
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:01,582
Why should we allow
the uneducated

439
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:03,707
to upset us?

440
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:05,290
You are right

441
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:07,874
Goodbye
Take care

442
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,249
Βye

443
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:28,874
The improved version of
Wing Chun

444
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:33,040
is the good use of 'distant fist,
near elbow,

445
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:34,749
close wrestling, incorporating long
and short distance movements'

446
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:38,624
Wing Chun wrestling uses the reverse
joint principle;

447
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:40,624
no need to hold on
to your opponent

448
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:46,082
Your Master concentrated

449
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:49,415
on the long stretch
and low kick

450
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,124
My improved version
of Wing Chun

451
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:56,499
incorporates the short stretch
and high kick

452
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:58,874
Wing Chun should not be

453
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:01,457
described as 'authentic' or
'non-authentic' anymore

454
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:02,999
Τo me, Wing Chun is
one big family,

455
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:07,290
there is no distinction between
you, me, and him

456
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:13,665
Goodbye, Man lp

457
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,832
Our surname goes first,
Reverend

458
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:19,249
lp Man, all the best

459
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:20,957
Same to you, goodbye

460
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,040
Goodbye

461
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:23,374
Let's go

462
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:32,790
Βye!
Βye!

463
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,624
Goodbye!
Βye!

464
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:58,624
Τhank you
Τhank you

465
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:02,874
You should have told me
you were coming back, lp Man

466
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:03,749
Mei Wai

467
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:04,499
lp Man's back, everybody!

468
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:05,832
You brought back
so many things

469
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:06,707
Only this one is mine,

470
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:08,415
the rest are presents
for you all

471
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,332
We know Ip Man is good to us!
OK

472
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:12,749
Τhis is for you

473
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,249
For me?

474
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,624
How am I supposed
to finish all these toffees

475
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:18,790
Don't eat them all,
some are for my brother to sell

476
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:19,999
Man!

477
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:20,749
Tin Chi's back!

478
00:38:20,791 --> 00:38:21,457
Brother!

479
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:22,124
There you are!

480
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,207
Yes!

481
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:25,124
Long time no see.

482
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,665
You're still stout. Keeping up
with martial arts practice?

483
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,582
Do you want to try me?

484
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:29,540
Sure!

485
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,124
Give it to me

486
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:41,749
One point for Man

487
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:02,749
Great! Another point
for you, Man!

488
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:06,665
What style is this?

489
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,707
Wing Chun!

490
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:09,290
The high kick doesn't exist
in Wing Chun,

491
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:10,332
where did you
pick that up?

492
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:12,874
Τry me more first
OK

493
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:45,124
Good!
One point for Τin Chi

494
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,624
Excellent!
Good!

495
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:01,790
Don't tell me this is
Wing Chun, Man?

496
00:40:01,791 --> 00:40:04,207
Τhis is fantastic.
Show me, lp Man

497
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:05,124
lt's wonderful!
Teach me, too

498
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:05,915
Me, too

499
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,165
Me first!

500
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,665
One at a time

501
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,374
Mei Wai, watch out!

502
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:25,415
Is this necessary, Man?

503
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,499
l'm all right.
Τake it easy next time

504
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:28,915
Take a rest, Mei Wai

505
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,124
Let's learn it together

506
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:32,624
To reward your enthusiasm.
Come on!

507
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:51,374
Alright?

508
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:53,415
Amazing!

509
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,624
This focuses on the reverse
joint principle

510
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:57,082
It's a different approach
like Japanese Judo,

511
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:58,332
there's no need to hold on
to your opponent

512
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:00,040
lt's amazing!
I want to learn, too

513
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:00,624
Me, too
Count me in

514
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:04,582
Βrother Chung So

515
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:05,915
Let me help you

516
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:09,207
Such a fat chicken,
let me take care of it

517
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:15,082
Remember what Master Chan
said to you, Man?

518
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:20,874
Τime to go home

519
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:25,624
Let's go!

520
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:27,790
I ask you

521
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:30,624
Whose style is authentic,

522
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:32,540
our Master Chan's or
Leung Βik's?

523
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:34,415
Leung Βik?

524
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,290
Βrother Chung So,

525
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:38,624
Mr Leung and our Master are
from the same school;

526
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:39,957
his style shouldn't be considered
deviant from authenticity

527
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:42,957
Also, Leung Βik is Grand
Master Leung Jan's son;

528
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:44,499
he practiced with him
since he was a child

529
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:46,790
But he never got along
with the Grand Master,

530
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:50,165
nor with his brothers.
Leung Βik is conceited

531
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,290
Perhaps...he held
different views

532
00:41:53,916 --> 00:41:55,207
Despite a difference
in views,

533
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:58,165
he shouldn't have created
tension in the family

534
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,582
I remember after the Grand
Master passed away,

535
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:04,832
Bik's brother immendiately
put up a wall...

536
00:42:04,916 --> 00:42:06,457
to partition the two families;

537
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:09,624
you can see how badly he was
received by the others

538
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:11,457
He's a bit strange,

539
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:13,624
but we can't assume that
his art is not competent

540
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:16,249
People often thought that Wing Chun
seldom uses wrestling moves

541
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,790
But he believes that by applying
the targeted finger style

542
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:20,707
or darting hand movements,
opponents can be overpowered

543
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:22,790
l've tried it and
it's very effective.

544
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:25,540
Comparing Βik's with the tradional moves,
his allow more flexibility

545
00:42:26,208 --> 00:42:28,957
Let me tell you, the Wing Chun
Leung Bik has learned...

546
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:30,749
only accounts for a fraction
of his father's.

547
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:33,957
Most of his movements
are made up

548
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:37,374
How can one improve without
deconstructing the old?

549
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:40,290
You are greedy to aspire
for more before

550
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,124
you can manage the basic
Wing Chun principles

551
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:43,624
You'll end up
gaining nothing.

552
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:44,790
l'm fed up.
Enjoy your meal

553
00:42:44,791 --> 00:42:47,124
Don't get upset,
Βrother Chung So

554
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:50,582
Man just got back,
give him a chance!

555
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:54,540
Fine! He has his chance now

556
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:58,415
Show me the sort of deviance
you've picked up.

557
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,999
Get up, up!

558
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:03,582
Βrother Chung So!
Βrother Chung So!

559
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:05,624
Ip Man

560
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:13,457
Βrother Chung So!
Stay away!

561
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:15,290
What happened to the things
Leung Βik taught you?

562
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,582
Βrother Chung So!
Man!

563
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:52,124
Ip man should be feeling
sorry by now

564
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:54,165
Βrother Chung So,
that's enough!

565
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:57,540
Was it Wing Chun that
he just demonstrated?

566
00:43:57,625 --> 00:44:00,665
Does our school have
high kick like that?

567
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,374
Or elbow as low as his?

568
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:08,540
Now, l demand you all go on your knees
in front of our master and vow that...

569
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:11,957
you will never again learn anything that
deviates from our school tradition

570
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:16,124
Τhey have nothing
to do with this,

571
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:19,499
Βrother Chung So

572
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,165
lt was me who wanted to try things out.

573
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:24,124
Τhey never said they wanted
to learn it from me.

574
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:25,749
I'm the only one who deserves
punishment for this

575
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:45,540
l have taught you
all l know, Man

576
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:46,832
Thank you, Master!

577
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:49,707
Stop calling me master

578
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,290
Why?

579
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:55,915
Your master is Chan Wah Shun;
you have to show due respect

580
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:58,874
When l was young,

581
00:44:58,958 --> 00:45:01,332
I was too emotional to try to
think from another's perspective

582
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:03,582
And my family
was too conservative

583
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:06,832
to accept my innovative
ideas,

584
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:11,457
thus causing a lot of
misunderstanding and friction

585
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:14,207
ln order to aviod conflict,

586
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:17,499
l decided to leave Foshan

587
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:05,624
Ip Man is gifted,
but he's such an ungrateful brat

588
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:08,832
Do you think
I should expel him?

589
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:16,082
Please give me instruction,
Master

590
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:19,457
If you think I should,

591
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:21,124
please show 'the head'
when l toss the coin

592
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:26,874
Master, lp Man is young
and restless;

593
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:28,124
he's doomed to make
some mistakes

594
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:30,040
And...perhaps it's not entirely
his fault.

595
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:31,707
l might not be competent
enough as an instructor

596
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:34,832
Why don't we do it three times
to decide on the result?

597
00:46:38,458 --> 00:46:40,457
Thanks, Master

598
00:46:42,958 --> 00:46:44,665
Thanks, Master,
thanks a great deal

599
00:47:00,458 --> 00:47:01,249
You are...

600
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:02,957
We heard that your Association has
a reputation for the vision of

601
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:05,999
promoting martial arts on the grounds
of abolishing segregation of schools

602
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:08,290
So we're here to join
the Association

603
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:10,749
l'm glad that you share
the same vision.

604
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:12,957
How may I address you?

605
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:14,374
Before we enroll,

606
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:17,082
l'd like to see whether the
Association is qualified to teach us

607
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,374
I don't quite understand
what you mean

608
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:21,832
You need to show a sample
when you sell goods.

609
00:47:21,916 --> 00:47:24,832
So we'd like to check out how competent
the masters are first

610
00:47:24,916 --> 00:47:28,499
This is not how our
Association operates.

611
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:30,415
Don't make things
difficult

612
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:32,582
All right, then.

613
00:47:32,666 --> 00:47:35,124
If you don't want to demonstate,
we'll be happy to take over

614
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:38,207
You just came to
create trouble

615
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:39,957
Hold it!

616
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:41,624
Wait a minute!

617
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:44,749
Father

618
00:47:45,208 --> 00:47:46,624
Chairman Kitano,

619
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:50,374
what do you want
from us?

620
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:54,749
Not much, l only
want to say hello

621
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:58,290
I don't think so,
it's more like picking a fight

622
00:47:58,291 --> 00:48:00,374
This is a place to learn
martial arts;

623
00:48:00,458 --> 00:48:02,915
l don't see why not!

624
00:48:09,916 --> 00:48:12,665
Chairman Lee, allow me

625
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:43,874
Good! Good fight!

626
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:53,707
Stop!
What are you doing?

627
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:29,832
Good! Good show!

628
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,957
Sorry that my daughter
isn't as capable

629
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:54,374
Valour is better demonstrated
by the young!

630
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:04,290
Come and have a snack,
Ip Man

631
00:50:10,791 --> 00:50:11,957
Yours

632
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:13,457
Triple fried sticks

633
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:15,165
Yes! My creation

634
00:50:15,416 --> 00:50:17,790
Three-sided.
How can one person finish it?

635
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:20,249
lt's for all three of us.
We each have one

636
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:23,915
You two have the crispy sides,
the middle part is not as crunchy

637
00:50:25,541 --> 00:50:28,832
The triple stick is what you wanted
when you were a kid

638
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:31,790
I didn't say that

639
00:50:31,791 --> 00:50:33,707
You really don't remember, eh?

640
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,249
lt seemed that l had a sense of humour
when I was a kid

641
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:39,207
Too bad you have none left.

642
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:40,124
I won't eat any more

643
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:42,874
Mei Wai...

644
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:47,374
What have l said wrong?

645
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:50,790
No! Let's eat

646
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:02,415
Oh yes! I forgot to
congratulate you

647
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:04,207
On what?

648
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:07,290
On your successful career in business,
young and hopeful

649
00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:10,665
What's more, Chairman Lee will recommend
you for Vice Chairman,

650
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:12,124
a bright future
lies ahead of you

651
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:15,707
Stop teasing me. I owe this to
Brother Chung So's leadership

652
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:20,290
What's your plan
after graduation?

653
00:51:20,291 --> 00:51:22,957
I won't keep it from you,
but don't laugh at me, alright?

654
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:29,165
I'd like to start a martial arts school
to promote Wing Chun

655
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:32,207
What a wonderful idea!
If you start in Foshan,

656
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:33,457
l'll come up with
the capital for you

657
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:36,165
Not just in Foshan,
I want it all over the world

658
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:39,207
l want to show the world
how wonderful Wing Chun is

659
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:41,207
The world? Great!

660
00:51:41,291 --> 00:51:41,957
Congratulations to you,

661
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,124
Guru of Wing Chun,who will breed
numerous splendid students

662
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:45,457
Τhank you!

663
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:49,124
Also, when you
become popular,

664
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:51,457
let's make a film

665
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:53,332
to promote Wing Chun
to the whole world

666
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:55,332
You'll contribute the capital,
and me, the hard work

667
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:59,624
Good! What about profit?
Let's say thirty seventy

668
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:00,915
Fifty fifty!

669
00:52:00,958 --> 00:52:02,624
You forty me sixty.
Definite!

670
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:04,124
Τhe congee is getting cold. Eat!

671
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:05,374
Done deal!

672
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:07,207
Let's eat first!

673
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:21,957
Sis!

674
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:29,457
What?

675
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:32,624
The mayor's son is here.
He wants to ask you out to a film

676
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:35,124
And Dad has agreed
on your behalf

677
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:37,540
Is that right?
Yes!

678
00:52:37,625 --> 00:52:39,957
Did he say what film?

679
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:42,874
Do you really want to go?

680
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:44,957
What about Ip Man?

681
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:46,749
What about your freedom
of romanatic love?

682
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:48,874
Freedom of romantic love?

683
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:53,582
I've waited so long,
but have yet to find my love

684
00:52:55,625 --> 00:53:00,082
Perhaps Ip Man and
l are not connected

685
00:53:03,958 --> 00:53:05,915
Do you really think so?

686
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,374
Or else how could l have done
so much but to no avail.

687
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:11,082
What else can
I do about it?

688
00:53:25,625 --> 00:53:27,124
Look! A new film is on

689
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:29,540
l don't think
you're a fan of horrors.

690
00:53:29,625 --> 00:53:31,124
Let's go have a drink

691
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,582
No! l want to
see the film

692
00:53:33,041 --> 00:53:34,790
l'll go get the ticket, then

693
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:41,665
This way please!
Here's your ticket, have a seat.

694
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,374
lp Man?

695
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:52,165
Miss Justice?

696
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,957
Aren't you the daughter of
the Deputy Major? How are you?

697
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:57,624
Hello! Watching
this film, too?

698
00:53:57,708 --> 00:53:59,290
Yes, what a small world!

699
00:54:00,375 --> 00:54:03,582
Miss Cheung was looking
for you, Man

700
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:06,749
Really? Anything important?

701
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:12,957
Let's wait until the end
of the film

702
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:25,374
You're not even
afraid of thugs.

703
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:27,790
l thought you're
the fearless kind

704
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:32,332
Of course I'm fearless

705
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,124
Don't touch me!
What's happening now?

706
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:46,707
Now Dracula is moving towards the female
lead and about to bite her

707
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:51,040
Is the biting over?

708
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:52,624
He's still biting,
still biting

709
00:54:57,958 --> 00:54:59,624
Alright, you may open
your eyes now

710
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:01,540
Are you sure?

711
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:04,874
Yes!

712
00:55:20,208 --> 00:55:22,999
I'm Dracula
So am l

713
00:55:23,083 --> 00:55:25,707
Scared the wits out of me.
Excuse me

714
00:55:25,958 --> 00:55:28,290
Please allow me to take you home,
Miss Cheung

715
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,832
Don't worry about it,
Mr. Cho, bye!

716
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:32,290
Come on...
Miss Cheung, when will we...

717
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:33,790
Τhree yams, please!

718
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:36,207
Τhanks for taking me to the film,
thank you very much.

719
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,332
See you
Βye!

720
00:55:40,958 --> 00:55:42,124
Buying yams?

721
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:45,332
Where did you pick up
your Englsih, Miss Cheung?

722
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:47,249
l learned it myself

723
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:49,499
My brother took Englsih lessons
in Hong Kong, too

724
00:55:49,583 --> 00:55:52,374
Perhaps you two can get together
and practise speaking it

725
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:55,707
Where are we heading now?

726
00:55:55,791 --> 00:55:58,124
Τomorrow will be our Master's birthday,
we'll go buy a chicken

727
00:55:58,458 --> 00:55:59,624
OK

728
00:55:59,708 --> 00:56:03,499
Let's leave, Mei Wai.
We don't speak English, neither do you!

729
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,832
Let's go

730
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:11,082
Didn't you say you had
something to ask me?

731
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:12,915
No need now

732
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,165
You're amusing,
yet l have a question to ask you

733
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,999
Please do

734
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:22,624
I've not got your name

735
00:56:24,875 --> 00:56:27,874
Didn't you address me
as Miss Justice?

736
00:56:27,958 --> 00:56:29,624
I like it

737
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:33,040
You're not going to tell me

738
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:37,790
My name is
Cheung Wing Shing

739
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:43,707
Τhe feeling of thinking of a person,
whose name is not known,

740
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:46,374
is like listening to a song

741
00:56:46,458 --> 00:56:49,749
without knowing the title

742
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,457
Or you know
the person's name,

743
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:56,249
but not what he's
thinking about

744
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:58,874
The feeling is like listening
to a song,

745
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:01,290
when the title is familiar
but not the tune

746
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:08,915
One, two, three, four

747
00:57:10,041 --> 00:57:12,040
Is it hurting you?

748
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:15,457
It's not nice to me.
Beat it up

749
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:17,624
Watch me!

750
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:21,999
Like this, one, two

751
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:29,457
So slow, speed it up,
come on, come on

752
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:31,957
Don't laugh, laughing
drains energy

753
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:42,957
Look at you, being around
this log all day long

754
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:49,040
You've grown to be loglike,
hopelessly inarticulate

755
00:57:50,916 --> 00:57:53,790
How can l be more expressive,
then?

756
00:57:54,791 --> 00:57:58,290
You can exercise your thoughts,
for instance...

757
00:57:58,291 --> 00:58:03,999
Τhink of something you like or
somebody you want to be with

758
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:09,040
Well, l'll stick your name here,
then, Cheung...Wing...Shing

759
00:58:09,208 --> 00:58:11,040
So you want to beat me
up every day?

760
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:13,957
No, no, no!
l just want to be with you

761
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:16,124
lp man!
Go and help prepare dinner

762
00:58:16,208 --> 00:58:18,165
I'm taking Wing Shing
out for dinner

763
00:58:24,291 --> 00:58:26,415
Come over here, Wing Shing,
I have something to tell you

764
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,124
Go clean the study
Yes, Sir!

765
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,290
What do you want to
tell me, Dad?

766
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:38,915
You've made a major mistake,
Wing Shing

767
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:41,124
What major mistake?

768
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:46,124
Τhe worst I could think of was giving
the Mayor's son the cold shoulder

769
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:48,624
You shouldn't have gone out with
that martial arts guy, lp Man

770
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:50,165
lf you loathe martial
arts guys so much,

771
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:52,290
why do you support the
Jing Wu Athletic Association, then?

772
00:58:52,291 --> 00:58:54,957
I support them because
my job requires it

773
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:57,040
Our freidnship is not based
on a job.

774
00:58:57,125 --> 00:58:58,540
I'm not a hypocrite like you

775
00:58:58,625 --> 00:58:59,957
Me a hypocrite?

776
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:03,374
I'm your dad,
why won't you listen to me?

777
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:05,915
I'm just worried that you make friends
who are a bad influence

778
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,082
and bring disgrace
on the family

779
00:59:08,541 --> 00:59:11,665
Unless you don't care much
about our family,

780
00:59:13,041 --> 00:59:16,665
go back to your room
and reflect

781
00:59:21,916 --> 00:59:22,999
For you

782
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:27,290
Thank you. I'm sure it'll bring
a lot of sweet dreams

783
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:31,749
I'm afraid that we might have
to stop seeing each other

784
00:59:32,958 --> 00:59:34,749
What happened?

785
00:59:36,958 --> 00:59:38,790
l'm here to see
Deputy Mayor Cheung

786
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,165
Please come in!

787
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:49,124
Please take a seat

788
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:55,040
OK, it's done

789
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:58,249
l hope to see you soon,
Mr. Cheung

790
00:59:59,583 --> 01:00:01,832
The pleasure was all mine

791
01:00:01,916 --> 01:00:03,624
See you soon

792
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:08,332
Βy the way, where can
l purchase "bone china"?

793
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:13,915
He wants to find out where
he can purchase some Chinese bones

794
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,124
Chinese bones?

795
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:17,499
The British simply
adore bone china

796
01:00:17,583 --> 01:00:21,082
Τhe Βritish have developed
a taste for Chinese bones

797
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:23,749
l think he can get a better price
from the slaughter house

798
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:28,832
Go to the "Killing Animal House"
to buy some

799
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,749
Killing Animal?

800
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:33,457
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Kill, kill, kill

801
01:00:35,625 --> 01:00:39,957
ln that place they kill chickens, kill cows,
kill pigs, kill ducks, kill geese...

802
01:00:41,458 --> 01:00:42,749
Τhank you
OK!

803
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:44,290
Sir!

804
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:48,082
Τhe Βritish would like to
buy bone China

805
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:55,374
He wants bone china!

806
01:00:57,833 --> 01:00:59,290
Just kidding.

807
01:00:59,375 --> 01:01:04,290
Mr. Cheung says we can take you
to buy very good china bone

808
01:01:04,625 --> 01:01:05,999
Just kidding

809
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:07,874
Thanks for doing
the favor for me

810
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:10,249
Goodbye
Goodbye

811
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:22,665
Your Englsih is not bad,
young man. Your name?

812
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,624
Ip man

813
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:27,457
So you're lp Man,
here for Wing Shing?

814
01:01:27,541 --> 01:01:30,415
l'm here to pay a special
visit to Mr. Deputy Mayor

815
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:32,374
Pay me a visit?

816
01:01:33,125 --> 01:01:35,707
Something's happening, sis!

817
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:37,457
What are you
fussing about?

818
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:39,374
Ip Man's here

819
01:01:39,458 --> 01:01:40,540
lp Man's here?

820
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:43,207
He came to see Dad. I don't know
what they're up to. Come and see

821
01:02:14,041 --> 01:02:15,290
Let me help you!

822
01:02:15,375 --> 01:02:16,624
No, thanks!

823
01:02:19,375 --> 01:02:22,665
Let's go to a movie tonight

824
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,415
What about the others?

825
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:29,124
Siu Shan and Yiu Choi
don't like dramas

826
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:31,624
What about Ip Man?

827
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:36,082
lp Man...has company

828
01:02:36,416 --> 01:02:38,707
Let me think about it

829
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,457
Don't think for too long.
The movie will be off soon

830
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:59,124
When do you want
to go, then?

831
01:03:00,166 --> 01:03:02,832
Actually, I've already got
two tickets.

832
01:03:02,916 --> 01:03:08,457
Τoo bad I couldn't get toffee,
only some chocolates

833
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:54,749
Good day, Master Ng.
This is a present from Mr. Chan

834
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:57,957
Thank you, Yiu Choi!
Yes!

835
01:03:58,041 --> 01:03:59,707
Τake the presents
to the main hall

836
01:03:59,791 --> 01:04:01,415
Τhis way, please!
Τhank you!

837
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:05,124
Look at these paper cuts, Man

838
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:07,082
Thanks for your trouble

839
01:04:07,166 --> 01:04:07,874
Τhank you!

840
01:04:07,916 --> 01:04:09,665
Lay it out properly

841
01:04:12,791 --> 01:04:14,540
Hey, move the left lantern
more to the left

842
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:15,957
All right!

843
01:04:16,041 --> 01:04:17,957
Move the right lantern
more to the right

844
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:19,249
Finished?

845
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:21,082
Is my writing all right?

846
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:23,832
Tin Chi! Ip Man!

847
01:04:23,916 --> 01:04:26,624
Put these couplets
on the front door

848
01:04:26,625 --> 01:04:27,874
Alright!

849
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:30,707
I'll get the rice paste,
be back soon

850
01:04:30,791 --> 01:04:32,207
Hurry!

851
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:45,540
Mr. lp Tin Chi

852
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:48,999
Can I help you?

853
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:51,540
Τhe Kitanos asked me
to deliver

854
01:04:51,625 --> 01:04:53,624
a gift on your big day

855
01:04:54,125 --> 01:04:56,207
Happy wedding day!

856
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,499
l really want to know
how you feel now

857
01:05:36,458 --> 01:05:39,540
Thank you all! Cheers!

858
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:41,290
Hope you have
beautiful kids

859
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,540
l appreciate it

860
01:05:42,625 --> 01:05:44,124
Congratulations!

861
01:06:00,416 --> 01:06:02,457
Please take a seat!

862
01:06:04,291 --> 01:06:05,749
Mr. Ip, please sit down!

863
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:07,124
Τhanks

864
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:12,124
What a great evening!

865
01:06:12,208 --> 01:06:15,290
Tin Chi's got himself a wife
and l've got a daughter

866
01:06:15,458 --> 01:06:16,707
I'm very happy, too.

867
01:06:16,791 --> 01:06:18,957
To me, Mei Wai is like
half a daughter

868
01:06:18,958 --> 01:06:21,457
while Τin Chi is half a son

869
01:06:21,458 --> 01:06:24,165
Now half a daughter is
marrying half a son;

870
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:25,624
half a son is marrying
half a daughter

871
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:28,290
Τhe two halves together
form a perfect couple

872
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:32,165
Don't forget that Tin Chi
is my whole son

873
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:35,499
I'm most thrilled to see him
marrying your half daughter

874
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:38,165
You'll have another happy
occasion very soon.

875
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,749
I believe it'll be
Ip man's turn soon

876
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:42,790
Keep up the good work, Man!

877
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:43,957
Τin Chi,

878
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:46,790
have a wonderful
wedding night!

879
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:47,332
Thanks!

880
01:06:47,375 --> 01:06:50,499
Congratulations on your promotion to
the Deputy Chairmanship, too. Cheers!

881
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:51,249
Τhank you!

882
01:06:51,291 --> 01:06:52,624
Why don't we fill up
the glasses?

883
01:06:52,625 --> 01:06:54,124
Βottoms up!
Βottoms up!

884
01:06:54,125 --> 01:06:54,915


885
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:56,540
Tin Chi, work hard!

886
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:59,915
I know, Dad. Cheers!

887
01:07:04,583 --> 01:07:06,624
To my woman

888
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:08,624
Τo my man

889
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:16,957
Cheers again!

890
01:07:22,291 --> 01:07:24,290
Come on!

891
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,415
Master!

892
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,665
He was very happy
and is a bit tipsy

893
01:07:31,458 --> 01:07:38,665
Stay here tonight,
Ip Man. Go to sleep, go!

894
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:40,374
Yes, Sir!

895
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:42,290
Watch your step
Ip Man

896
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:47,290
Let's fill our glasses
again, Man

897
01:07:47,708 --> 01:07:49,499
It's getting late,
President Lee

898
01:07:49,583 --> 01:07:51,082
What do you mean
by late?

899
01:07:55,541 --> 01:07:58,249
The night is still young.

900
01:07:58,666 --> 01:08:01,290
Tin Chi said your martial
arts skill is superb

901
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:03,749
Come on!
Show me your skills

902
01:08:04,125 --> 01:08:04,957
Next time!

903
01:08:05,041 --> 01:08:08,040
Why next time?
Let's do it tonight

904
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:09,540
President Lee, seriously,
it's getting late!

905
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:11,290
Let's not start late, then

906
01:08:15,583 --> 01:08:17,040
President Lee!

907
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:19,415
Sir!

908
01:08:19,541 --> 01:08:22,457
We don't need you here.
Retire to your room. Let's try again

909
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:23,707
President Lee!

910
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:50,790
Let's go!

911
01:08:52,791 --> 01:08:55,040
Sit tight, off we go!

912
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:18,624
Master Ng, Master Ip,
where's Τin Chi? lsn't he coming?

913
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:20,165
lt was his wedding
night last night.

914
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:21,540
l'll tell him later

915
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:22,957
Let's go in first

916
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:26,082
Master

917
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:27,540
Τhis way

918
01:09:35,333 --> 01:09:37,457
l can't imagine the
honorable and

919
01:09:37,458 --> 01:09:39,915
respected President ended up
with such a tragic death

920
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,915
We must locate the murderer,

921
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,290
the President cannot
die in vain

922
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:48,415
Show me in. Have you reported
to the police?

923
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,165
Not yet

924
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:50,624
We'd better report it first

925
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:51,749
Right away

926
01:09:51,833 --> 01:09:53,040
Got it!

927
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:14,415
Where's my brother?

928
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,790
ln his room

929
01:10:17,958 --> 01:10:22,957
lp Tin Chi!

930
01:10:25,125 --> 01:10:26,582
Ip Τin Chi, come with me

931
01:10:26,666 --> 01:10:27,999
What's wrong?

932
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:29,665
You stay here.

933
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:32,457
You come with me right now;
l have to talk to you

934
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:38,040
What's the matter?

935
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,582
People should have
qualms of conscience

936
01:10:40,666 --> 01:10:42,374
What're you getting at?

937
01:10:42,458 --> 01:10:45,415
Didn't Lee Man Ho treat you
like his son?

938
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,290
Why did you do that?

939
01:10:47,291 --> 01:10:48,957
What've I done?

940
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:54,832
Are you out of your mind?

941
01:10:54,916 --> 01:10:56,040
Stop acting innocent!

942
01:10:56,125 --> 01:10:57,707
Strangle me if you
have the balls

943
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,499
I have no clue
what you're talking about

944
01:10:58,541 --> 01:11:00,332
You strangled President Lee,

945
01:11:00,416 --> 01:11:01,874
only you used left hand

946
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:02,957
Lee is dead?

947
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,207
l won't let him die in vain!

948
01:11:04,291 --> 01:11:06,957
Let go of him, Man!
What are you two doing?

949
01:11:07,041 --> 01:11:08,374
Why start a fight?

950
01:11:08,458 --> 01:11:09,832
Your Godfather was killed.

951
01:11:09,916 --> 01:11:12,749
Look this man in the eyes.
He is the killer

952
01:11:13,791 --> 01:11:15,957
All because he was strangled
with the left hand,

953
01:11:16,041 --> 01:11:17,457
you're accusing me
of murder

954
01:11:17,541 --> 01:11:19,499
l'm not the only one in Foshan
who's learned the strangling move

955
01:11:19,583 --> 01:11:21,374
You taught me this move.

956
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:22,624
You know how to strangle
with your left hand, too.

957
01:11:22,708 --> 01:11:24,374
The Japanese want to get rid
of their opponents.

958
01:11:24,458 --> 01:11:26,082
You must be the one
who helped them

959
01:11:26,166 --> 01:11:26,915
Tell me,

960
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:28,874
why did the Japanese send
gifts to your wedding?

961
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:30,749
I do business with
many foreigners.

962
01:11:30,833 --> 01:11:33,499
It's no surprise that the Japanese
would send me presents

963
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:36,957
Swear that you have nothing
to do with President Lee's murder

964
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:43,124
All right! I, lp Tin Chi swear...

965
01:11:43,125 --> 01:11:46,374
Τin Chi, the police are here

966
01:11:46,458 --> 01:11:48,082
Ip Man, have you reported
to the police?

967
01:11:49,625 --> 01:11:53,624
Mr. Ip Τin Chi, we are here to take
Mr. lp Man to the police station

968
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:54,915
Why are you taking
my brother away?

969
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,082
He's suspected of
President Lee's murder

970
01:11:58,166 --> 01:11:59,874
Lee's servant witnessed
a fight and heated

971
01:11:59,958 --> 01:12:03,957
argument between Ip Man
and Lee last night

972
01:12:03,958 --> 01:12:05,499
Τhe President was quite drunk

973
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:07,124
and my brother just escorted
him home

974
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:10,415
No need to start a fight with President Lee
after taking him home, right?

975
01:12:10,833 --> 01:12:12,790
Arrest him

976
01:12:12,875 --> 01:12:14,040
You're not taking
Ip Man away

977
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:16,082
Τhere must be some understanding here.
My brother doesn't kill

978
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:19,832
Mr. lp, please stop your wife from
obstructing our course of action

979
01:12:19,916 --> 01:12:23,790
I'll go with them.
I fear not as I'm innocent

980
01:12:23,875 --> 01:12:25,457
Go!

981
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:30,957
Ip Τin Chi, remember
you swore an oath

982
01:12:49,541 --> 01:12:50,915
lnspector,

983
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,374
if you don't have enough
evidence to press charges,

984
01:12:53,458 --> 01:12:55,582
you have to release him

985
01:12:55,958 --> 01:12:57,457
Deputy Mayor,

986
01:12:57,458 --> 01:12:59,624
Ip Man has been charged
with felony.

987
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:01,999
We need more time
to investigate

988
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:04,457
Ip Man is innocent,
you can't lock him up.

989
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:05,999
Miss Cheung,

990
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:10,415
we go by evidence; we don't bring
charges against innocent citizens

991
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:13,332
There are witnesses in this case.

992
01:13:14,125 --> 01:13:17,707
If he's innocent,

993
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:20,165
why won't he try to
defend himself?

994
01:13:20,458 --> 01:13:24,749
You keep saying
Ip Man is innocent;

995
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:26,540
do you have evidence,
Miss Cheung?

996
01:13:26,625 --> 01:13:29,207
Unless you can prove his innocence,
stop making these empty claims

997
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:07,707
lp Tin Chi has been elected President
of the Jing Wu Athletic Association

998
01:14:07,791 --> 01:14:10,290
Good!
Congratulations!

999
01:14:10,791 --> 01:14:12,290
Τhank you!

1000
01:14:12,291 --> 01:14:17,707
Congratulations!
Τhank you!

1001
01:14:46,125 --> 01:14:47,749
Mr. Kitano will donate

1002
01:14:47,833 --> 01:14:50,374
$300,000 to the Association

1003
01:14:50,458 --> 01:14:55,040
And will send his students here
to exchange knowledge.

1004
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:57,249
Any objections?

1005
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,957
Lee Man Ho...
killers in ambush

1006
01:15:59,333 --> 01:16:00,457
You can leave now!

1007
01:16:00,541 --> 01:16:02,499
How come?

1008
01:16:02,916 --> 01:16:04,790
Let's get out of here first

1009
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:07,624
Come on!

1010
01:16:07,708 --> 01:16:09,457
At 10:30 pm,
the night of the murder,

1011
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:11,040
Ip Man came to
my place

1012
01:16:11,125 --> 01:16:13,332
We stayed up and chatted.

1013
01:16:14,125 --> 01:16:19,957
He was drunk and
so spent the night in my room

1014
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:23,457
Miss Cheung, are you
telling the truth?

1015
01:16:23,541 --> 01:16:27,457
Were you really with lp man
on the night of the murder?

1016
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,374
Your testimony
is critical to the case

1017
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:34,874
If you're making things up,
you could be arrested

1018
01:16:37,916 --> 01:16:40,790
l swear the truth in my capacity
as the Deputy Mayor's daughter

1019
01:16:40,916 --> 01:16:43,624
However, I can't simply
take your alibi and

1020
01:16:43,708 --> 01:16:45,957
believe that Ip Man
is innocent

1021
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:48,790
I need more
supporting evidence

1022
01:16:49,291 --> 01:16:51,582
More supporting evidence?

1023
01:16:51,666 --> 01:16:56,082
Is my daughter's chastity
not enough

1024
01:16:56,166 --> 01:16:58,457
to prove his innocence?

1025
01:16:59,583 --> 01:17:02,957
I guess I need the
Provincial Governor

1026
01:17:03,375 --> 01:17:05,457
to come and do justice

1027
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:11,624
Dad, don't be too upset.

1028
01:17:11,708 --> 01:17:15,832
l had no alternative but to
make up such a lie. I'm so sorry

1029
01:17:15,916 --> 01:17:19,457
You sacrificed your reputation
to rescue him;

1030
01:17:19,458 --> 01:17:22,040
just to rescue a Kung Fu guy!

1031
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:23,957
You must marry my sister
as soon as you can!

1032
01:17:23,958 --> 01:17:25,874
Dad, don't get mad!
Wing Shing!

1033
01:17:25,958 --> 01:17:27,915
Sorry! I'm not worth it

1034
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:31,290
Worth it or not is only
for me to decide

1035
01:17:33,375 --> 01:17:36,665
I don't want you to
marry me because of this

1036
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,040
Wing Shing!

1037
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,332
That's not what I mean,
l want you to marry me

1038
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:48,415
l'll take you as my wife with an official
ceremony and a grand wedding.

1039
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,540
Your father need not worry

1040
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:25,790
Mei Wai! Mei Wai!

1041
01:18:35,833 --> 01:18:38,332
Mei Wai, why are you
doing this?

1042
01:18:38,416 --> 01:18:41,540
Did you kill my Godfather,
Τin Chi?

1043
01:18:42,791 --> 01:18:44,124
Do you work
for the Japanese?

1044
01:18:44,125 --> 01:18:47,999
Did you betray your own people
for money, or for power?

1045
01:18:48,125 --> 01:18:50,124
lt's not as simple
as you think

1046
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:52,749
lt's hard to explain

1047
01:18:53,458 --> 01:18:55,790
Mei Wai,
please don't leave me!

1048
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:57,832
Listen to me

1049
01:18:57,916 --> 01:19:00,540
l beg you.
Please listen!

1050
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:03,290
What other lies do you
want to tell me?

1051
01:19:03,458 --> 01:19:07,749
You can't die,
you'll be a mother soon

1052
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:15,165
But you've killed,
you should give yourself in

1053
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,832
It won't work! It won't work!

1054
01:19:17,916 --> 01:19:23,124
Listen! We should go
somewhere we belong

1055
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,165
Where's the letter?

1056
01:19:35,416 --> 01:19:37,165
Who came?

1057
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:40,624
Tell me, who came?

1058
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:42,290
No... Nobody

1059
01:19:42,291 --> 01:19:45,332
Tell me who was here?

1060
01:19:46,375 --> 01:19:50,415
Brother Chung So...
he came to see me just now

1061
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:54,582
l've caused my brother
enough damage,

1062
01:19:54,666 --> 01:19:56,790
I don't want to involve
Βrother Chung So

1063
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:22,290
Where are you heading?

1064
01:20:22,708 --> 01:20:26,082
I've done so much for
your career advancement

1065
01:20:26,166 --> 01:20:28,415
Dad even made Ip Man
the culprit for your crime

1066
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:31,040
And you back out because
of this lowly woman!

1067
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:35,624
I've done what you told me.
What more do you want from me?

1068
01:20:35,625 --> 01:20:42,915
Kill Ng Chung So;
he's aware that you're working for us

1069
01:20:43,083 --> 01:20:45,040
For you, and for us,

1070
01:20:45,125 --> 01:20:47,665
whoever gets in the way
should be eliminated

1071
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:50,957
l don't want to
kill any more!

1072
01:20:51,041 --> 01:20:52,457
Τhis is not an option!

1073
01:21:18,625 --> 01:21:20,124
Τin Chi!

1074
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:20,999
Don't hurt her!

1075
01:21:21,041 --> 01:21:22,540
Τin Chi!

1076
01:21:22,666 --> 01:21:24,874
I gave you my word
on the honor of a samurai:

1077
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:28,415
You'll be free to leave
after this mission

1078
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,290
Don't say that you haven't been
given a second chance!

1079
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:31,290
How can I overcome him?

1080
01:21:31,375 --> 01:21:32,249
lf you can't do this alone,

1081
01:21:32,333 --> 01:21:33,665
we'll form a brother
and sister team

1082
01:21:42,125 --> 01:21:44,665
Tin Chi, come out!

1083
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:47,082
Τin Chi, come out quick!

1084
01:21:47,166 --> 01:21:49,207
We don't spare traitors in the
Wing Chun Martial Arts School

1085
01:21:49,958 --> 01:21:51,874
He's no longer your senior.

1086
01:21:51,958 --> 01:21:53,624
Get him out here, now!

1087
01:22:05,916 --> 01:22:08,457
Τin Chi!
Τin Chi!

1088
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,290
l beg your forgiveness, Master.

1089
01:22:23,291 --> 01:22:24,957
I've failed as a teacher
and a leader

1090
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:30,790
Yiu Choi! Yiu Choi!

1091
01:24:34,791 --> 01:24:35,790
Master!

1092
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:46,915
lp Tin Chi, you traitor!

1093
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,790
Τhat's no way to treat
your fellow disciples

1094
01:25:18,416 --> 01:25:20,249
Watch out, Man!

1095
01:25:20,333 --> 01:25:21,749
I will!

1096
01:25:33,625 --> 01:25:34,832
Kill him!

1097
01:26:55,916 --> 01:26:57,999
Clear the way!

1098
01:29:41,291 --> 01:29:43,290
l beat you up, not in revenge
for being framed

1099
01:29:43,375 --> 01:29:46,415
Βut to defend Lee Man Ho,
the Master, and Dad's reputation

1100
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:49,624
Why did you turn traitor when you
were so loved and respected by us?

1101
01:29:50,791 --> 01:29:52,790
l'm not a traitor!

1102
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:58,207
I'm a Japanese sergeant,
Τanaka Eiketsu

1103
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:02,124
l left my parents
when I was twelve to

1104
01:30:03,458 --> 01:30:05,582
become a spy in China

1105
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:08,457
l miss my country,

1106
01:30:08,958 --> 01:30:10,874
I want to go home

1107
01:30:15,375 --> 01:30:19,124
I couldn't even see my mother
when she died

1108
01:30:19,541 --> 01:30:23,915
I have yet to be able to pay
my respects at her grave

1109
01:30:29,458 --> 01:30:33,165
lt might not be a bad idea
to die now,

1110
01:30:34,083 --> 01:30:36,624
so everything can be ended

1111
01:30:39,875 --> 01:30:44,165
I'm a soldier,
which leaves me no choice

1112
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:51,832
I'm relieved now as I've finally
carried out my mission

1113
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:57,582
I don't need to hurt the people
I love any more

1114
01:30:59,333 --> 01:31:01,582
lt's been a pleasure
to be adopted

1115
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:07,540
by the lp family and
be your brother

1116
01:31:10,458 --> 01:31:16,249
I have no regrets,
as Mei Wai has been my wife

1117
01:31:16,333 --> 01:31:18,332
Where's Mei Wai now?

1118
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:08,832
Ip Man...

1119
01:32:59,250 --> 01:33:00,790
Τhe essence of Wing Chun is to
follow one's shadow,

1120
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:04,457
not his hand.Focus on what you feel
rather than what you see

1121
01:34:17,208 --> 01:34:18,790
Where's Tin Chi?

1122
01:34:22,625 --> 01:34:27,665
I feel guilty;
l wasn't able to keep his son

1123
01:34:51,416 --> 01:34:54,249
Captain, these crates have just arrived.
They are all Kitano's

1124
01:34:54,333 --> 01:34:57,124
Open them for inspection!

1125
01:35:07,625 --> 01:35:13,332
Where am I? Who are you?
I want to go home

1126
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:14,707
Τhere's one over here, too!

1127
01:35:14,791 --> 01:35:17,124
Help him out
Over here, too!

1128
01:35:17,625 --> 01:35:20,499
Any water? Give them some!
Will do!

1129
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:33,457
Easy, get him out!

1130
01:35:33,541 --> 01:35:37,457
Dad, a beggar is
unconscious outside

1131
01:35:41,666 --> 01:35:43,790
Don't be afraid!
Leave!

1132
01:35:43,791 --> 01:35:45,582
Give them some water!

1133
01:36:01,958 --> 01:36:03,790
At the critical moment,

1134
01:36:03,875 --> 01:36:06,999
he arrived in a hurry
with a long rod in hand,

1135
01:36:07,083 --> 01:36:11,124
beating the hell out of
the Japanese with

1136
01:36:11,208 --> 01:36:14,999
the authentic Wing Chun
'half-past six' rod style

1137
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:16,999
However, his rod was slashed
into two halves

1138
01:36:17,083 --> 01:36:20,582
by your Uncle Tin Chi's
Japanese sword

1139
01:36:20,666 --> 01:36:25,332
Yet Τin Chi didn't let go,
he pressed even harder...

1140
01:36:25,416 --> 01:36:29,957
by attacking Ip Man
with Karate and Judo

1141
01:36:33,125 --> 01:36:35,332
How did my Dad react?

1142
01:36:35,416 --> 01:36:37,957
He was very alert;

1143
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:41,624
he immediately used the two half rods
like a pair of wing-shaped swords,

1144
01:36:41,625 --> 01:36:43,124
and brandished them frantically,

1145
01:36:43,208 --> 01:36:46,832
at times mixing in some
unknown styles,

1146
01:36:46,916 --> 01:36:49,415
styles difficult to identify,
to beat his opponent

1147
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:51,957
Τhese mixed movements,
regardless of their authenticity,

1148
01:36:52,041 --> 01:36:54,957
were not only powerful
enough to win,

1149
01:36:54,958 --> 01:36:57,582
but also good enough
to save my life

1150
01:36:57,666 --> 01:36:59,540
From then on, I stopped believing
that martial arts schools

1151
01:36:59,625 --> 01:37:01,749
should be segregated to maintain
their own authentic styles

1152
01:37:01,833 --> 01:37:03,957
My eyes were opened and
saw a broader horizon

1153
01:37:03,958 --> 01:37:07,207
l don't understand how Uncle Tin Chi
picked up Japanese Kung Fu?

1154
01:37:07,291 --> 01:37:08,374
Yeah! Why? Why?

1155
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:10,249
As a matter of fact,
your Uncle Τin Chi...

1156
01:37:10,333 --> 01:37:11,832
Why stop practicing?

1157
01:37:11,916 --> 01:37:12,582
Dad!

1158
01:37:12,625 --> 01:37:15,415
Go and do more training and
practice. Hurry! Hurry!

1159
01:37:15,541 --> 01:37:17,374
Let's go and practice!

1160
01:37:17,458 --> 01:37:18,999
Τelling stories again,
Βrother Chung So?

1161
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:20,874
You've gone over them
thousands of times

1162
01:37:20,958 --> 01:37:23,332
The thing is, every time
it's a new story to them

1163
01:37:23,416 --> 01:37:27,290
You're right! Children should
know about their past

1164
01:37:27,375 --> 01:37:28,790
Pay full attention
when you practice.

1165
01:37:28,791 --> 01:37:29,999
You are not allowed to eat
before you're done

1166
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:32,290
Dinner's ready, Jun!

1167
01:37:32,375 --> 01:37:34,665
Stop the training.
Come and eat, everybody!

1168
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:39,249
Dad says l have to practise
well before I can eat

1169
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:44,124
What's more important?
Martial Arts or food?

1170
01:37:44,125 --> 01:37:45,915
Food! Dad!

1171
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:46,707
All right!

1172
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:49,624
Take a good rest.
Practise more after you eat

1173
01:37:50,041 --> 01:37:52,790
Eat!
