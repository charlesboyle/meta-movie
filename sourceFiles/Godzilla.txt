1
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,639
<i>Ten...</i>

2
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,199
<i>nine, eight, seven, six...</i>

3
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,279
<i>five, four, three, two...</i>

4
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,547
<i>one.</i>

5
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,585
Dr. Serizawa?

6
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,159
Jerry Boyd. I'm warning
you, it's a mess.

7
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,759
It's just a total mess.

8
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,479
Monarch sent me in this morning.

9
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,226
Took a look around, but I
told them we needed you.

10
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,999
They picked up a radiation
pocket out here last month.

11
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,799
They got excited, thinking
they had a uranium deposit.

12
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,679
They started stacking up the
heavy machinery and then...

13
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,220
Well, the valley floor...

14
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,585
collapsed into a cavern below.

15
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,781
Just dropped away. Just gone.

16
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,381
Best guess right now is about
40 miners went down with it.

17
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,306
This way.

18
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,625
When they first discovered this pocket, the
radiation levels were only half as strong.

19
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,039
It's almost as if contact
with the outside air...

20
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,310
started catalyzing something.

21
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,587
Some kind of fossils, right?

22
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,981
I've been digging holes for 30 years,
I've never seen anything like it.

23
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,504
Oh, my God. Is it possible?

24
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,671
Is it him?

25
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,239
No.

26
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,429
This is much older.

27
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,390
Hey, guys. You gotta see this.

28
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,781
What is it?

29
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,470
Some kind of egg?

30
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,784
A dormant spore?

31
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,066
The bones are fossilized...

32
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,149
but this formation seems
to be perfectly preserved.

33
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,629
This one looks broken.

34
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,839
It's like something...

35
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,346
came out of it.

36
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,262
I'll get it. It's probably for me.

37
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,079
No, Takashi.

38
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,439
No. Takashi, just listen
to me for a second.

39
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,079
I'm asking for the meeting because if
I have to shut the reactor down...

40
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,860
you're not gonna want to
read about it in a memo.

41
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,239
I've been following these tremors since
they started in the Philippines...

42
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,622
and now they're in
our own backyard.

43
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,399
No, no, no. Hayato says...

44
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,431
I need to go through
you about this.

45
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,799
Look, I'm just...

46
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,105
trying to follow the protocols set forth
by the company. That's all. It's my job.

47
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,981
He's awake.

48
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,879
Oh, I know. He got up early.

49
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,039
What are we gonna do?

50
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,144
Get dressed. I'll figure it out.

51
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,901
- Okay?
- Okay.

52
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,479
Later, Dad.

53
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,759
With all due respect,
Takashi, and honor...

54
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,399
respect and honor,
with all of that...

55
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,759
I'm an engineer. I don't like
unexplained frequency patterning...

56
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,110
near a plant where I'm responsible.
I need a meeting. Make it happen.

57
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,399
Bye, Mom!

58
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,959
He made you a sign.

59
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,706
- What?
- Your birthday sign.

60
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,743
- He worked so hard.
- Oh, God.

61
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,879
I'm gonna come home early.

62
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,799
I'll take the car
and pick him up...

63
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,068
and we can get a proper cake. Okay?

64
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,279
Listen, I need to know...

65
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,879
that it's not the sensors. Okay?

66
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,399
I can't be calling this meeting and
look like the American maniac.

67
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,679
So when we get there...

68
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,679
don't even bother coming up. Just
grab a team and go down to Level 5.

69
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,999
You're not a maniac.

70
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,399
I mean, you are,
just not about this.

71
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,742
Must be something we're
not thinking of.

72
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,870
Happy birthday.

73
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,759
What? Is it...?

74
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,279
- Yes, it is. Ha, ha.
- Oh, I forgot all about it.

75
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,025
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

76
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,999
I should have a birthday
more often. Ha, ha.

77
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,359
<i>- What is this?
- Seismic anomaly.</i>

78
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,662
This graph is minutes.

79
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,519
X is minutes, not days.
This is now.

80
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,119
Wait, hold on. Seismic activity?

81
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,479
Seismic? You're talking
about earthquakes?

82
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,119
No, earthquakes are random, jagged.

83
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,185
This is consistent, increasing.

84
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,359
This is a pattern.

85
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,830
All right. Let's make this quick.

86
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,719
Takashi. What the hell is
going on? Have you seen this?

87
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,279
Yeah. Maybe not such...

88
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,105
good time for a meeting.

89
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,864
What's the source?

90
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,079
Where's the epicenter?

91
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,599
We don't know. But it
keeps getting stronger.

92
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,948
It's gotta be centered somewhere.

93
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,461
Hayato.

94
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,305
No one else is reporting it.

95
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,799
We are contacting every other
plant in the Kantō region.

96
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,519
Tōkai, Fujiyama.

97
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,799
They're unaffected.

98
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,105
But my guess is these readings are just
aftershocks from the Philippine earthquake.

99
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,279
Are we at full function?

100
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,547
Yes, we are.

101
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,302
But perhaps we should be
drawing down, to be safe.

102
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,301
Take us offline.

103
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,599
- Now, Joe...
- Do it!

104
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,199
Now. Wind it down.

105
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,439
Sandra.

106
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,946
Sandra, are you there?

107
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,759
We're turning back.

108
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,902
Let's go.

109
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,064
Oh, my God.

110
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,919
Joe, are you there?

111
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,799
<i>Joe, there's been a breach. We're
heading back to the containment seal.</i>

112
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,919
Listen. You need to
get out of there.

113
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,279
<i>If there's been a reactor breach,
you won't last five minutes...</i>

114
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,679
<i>with or without the suits.</i>

115
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,719
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

116
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,510
I hear you. We're coming!

117
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,305
I'll meet them there myself.

118
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,639
Put the safety doors
on manual override.

119
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,879
I cannot do that!

120
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,342
Keep the doors open.
My wife is still in there!

121
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,159
Come on...

122
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,063
let's go!

123
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,519
Tell me this door's...

124
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,359
on manual.

125
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,519
<i>Yeah. But we are
starting to breach!</i>

126
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,948
I'm here. Soon as they're
through, I'll seal it.

127
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,159
Sandra, can you...

128
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,269
hear me? I'm at the door.

129
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,423
Sandra?

130
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,239
Sandra, I'm waiting for you.

131
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,919
<i>I'm at the checkpoint.</i>

132
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,999
<i>But you have to run
as fast as you can.</i>

133
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,903
I am!

134
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,479
Kenji. Kenji...

135
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,020
we need to go!

136
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,679
<i>Joe!</i>

137
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,479
<i>Close the door!</i>

138
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,987
<i>Seal the corridor or the
whole city will be exposed.</i>

139
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,021
Sandra?

140
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,667
<i>- Joe? Joe, can you hear me?</i>
- Yes.

141
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,423
<i>- Are you there?</i>
- Sandra, I'm here. Can you hear me?

142
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,101
<i>Yeah.</i>

143
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,439
<i>Joe, it's too late.
We're not coming.</i>

144
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,519
No, don't say that!
Don't you say that!

145
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,629
Run as hard as you can, honey.

146
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,079
<i>Joe, you have to close the door.</i>

147
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,701
<i>You have to live for our son.</i>

148
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,679
<i>- Joe, seal the door! Now!</i>
- Oh, my God.

149
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,359
<i>Five seconds! Four seconds!</i>

150
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,710
I'm sorry.

151
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,221
Take care of Ford.

152
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,662
Be a good father.

153
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,639
I will.

154
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,590
We didn't make it.

155
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,627
Let's go out!

156
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,351
Hurry! Come on! Ford!

157
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,991
On your feet!

158
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,599
You got family waiting for you?

159
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,999
I hope so.

160
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,479
How long you been away?

161
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,079
Fourteen months.

162
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,279
Take it slow.

163
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,742
It's the one thing they
don't train you for.

164
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,468
All right! Let's go!

165
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,159
- I can't tell you.
- Can I see it?

166
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,461
Don't let him see.

167
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,199
Whoa. Oh, my God.

168
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,799
- It's a welcome home cake.
- Look at that.

169
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,039
That's you.

170
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,946
- And that's me.
- What's it say?

171
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,759
"Welcome home, Daddy."

172
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,719
Daddy's home.

173
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,879
- Daddy's home.
- Cake every night.

174
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,799
- Yeah, that's not happening.
- Daddy's home equals...

175
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,839
cake every night.

176
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,199
How did you manage to get
chocolate on your eyeball?

177
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,467
- Daddy did it.
- Heh.

178
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,039
<i>I can't sleep with you...</i>

179
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,910
- ...making all this noise.
- Hee-hee-hee.

180
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,662
Come on, let's get you into bed.

181
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,903
Okay, big man.

182
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,347
Time to hit the rack.

183
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,741
Dad?

184
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,581
Yeah?

185
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,621
Are you still gonna
be here tomorrow?

186
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,021
Yeah.

187
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,744
Come on, let's get some sleep.

188
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,799
Turns around, nose-to-nose,
he says, "At ease, lieutenant."

189
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,462
God, I missed your laugh.

190
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,790
I missed you.

191
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,780
Mmm.

192
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,079
Mm-mm.

193
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,759
- I should get that. No, it could be work.
- Mm-mm.

194
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,461
- I need to get that.
- You don't need to. Come on.

195
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,226
Hello?

196
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,559
Yeah, this is Mrs. Brody.

197
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,839
Tell him you're busy tending
to your husband's needs.

198
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,665
Shh.

199
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,503
Yeah, he's my husband.

200
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,068
Tell them we're not gonna buy it.

201
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,711
Yes, sir. Could you just
hold on one moment?

202
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,386
It's the consulate.

203
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,902
Joe's been arrested in Japan.

204
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,829
Elle, I can't find my pants.

205
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,065
They're in the other drawer.

206
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,639
So why was he trespassing
in the quarantine zone?

207
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,159
Ugh. Why do you think?

208
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,622
The lone crusader for the truth.

209
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,239
All his crackpot cuckoo theories.

210
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,719
Your father is a good man. He
just needs your help right now.

211
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,199
Ford, he's lost everything.

212
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,199
Yeah, so did I. But you
know what? I got over it.

213
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,229
Right. I can see that.

214
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,983
I'm sorry. It's just...

215
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,559
Every time I let him in close,
he always tries to drag me back.

216
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,546
And I can't. I can't put
our family through that.

217
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,988
Well, he is your family.

218
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,470
Hey. Come here.

219
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,191
You know you're only gonna be
gone for a few days, right?

220
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,222
And then you are gonna
come back to me.

221
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,744
Yeah. Yeah.

222
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,679
It's not the end of the world.

223
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,665
Papa.

224
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,511
I don't get many visitors.

225
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,226
Clearly.

226
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,181
This is you here.

227
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,839
Even, uh, Ph.D.'s...

228
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,064
don't get much teaching
English as a second language.

229
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,039
Here we go.

230
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,421
And a towel.

231
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,519
All right.

232
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,901
So...

233
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,239
how's the bomb business?

234
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,747
It must be a growth
area these days.

235
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,751
It's called "explosive
ordnance disposal."

236
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,959
My job isn't dropping bombs.

237
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,864
It's stopping them.

238
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,828
- Dad.
- Hey...

239
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,279
how's Elle doing?

240
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,519
And Sam. Oh, my God. He must be...

241
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,399
what? Three? Three and a half?

242
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,190
He's almost 5.

243
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,586
I thought you were over this.
"Echolocation"?

244
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,399
- Oh, hey.
- "Parasitic communication..."

245
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,919
Please don't, if you don't mind.
I have everything the way I like it.

246
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,999
I'm just... I'm
studying bioacoustics.

247
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,039
What were you doing,
going back there?

248
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,159
- This trespassing stuff, that was bull.
- You broke the law.

249
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,039
I was trying to get
back to our old house.

250
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,865
- In a quarantine zone.
- Precisely.

251
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,119
The new readings are exactly
like they were on that day...

252
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,719
and I can prove it to you.

253
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,919
With a little luck,
if I can get back...

254
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,359
to the house...

255
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,319
I can show you and the world this was
not from a natural disaster. This was...

256
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,621
Dad!

257
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,148
Your mom's out there, Ford.

258
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,941
To me...

259
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,109
she'll always be there.

260
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,700
They evacuated us so quickly.

261
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,544
I don't even have a picture of her.

262
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,744
This has to stop.

263
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,199
You know I did everything I could.

264
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,581
You know that, right?

265
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,105
Let me take you home.

266
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,509
Come home with me.

267
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,429
I got a little boy who's
desperate to see his grandpa.

268
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,144
We can leave tomorrow.

269
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,061
What are you doing?

270
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,105
I'm heading back out there, Ford.

271
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,439
- No. I don't think so.
- One hour, in and out.

272
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,946
I have to go!

273
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,519
I came back here and
wasted six years...

274
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,279
staring through that barbed
wire, thinking it was...

275
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,107
a military mistake or some horrible
design flaw they were covering up.

276
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,319
One day...

277
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,624
I met a guy who runs a
cargo boat offshore.

278
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,919
Every day he goes right
past the reactor site.

279
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,190
So he places a couple frequency
monitors on buoys for me.

280
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,279
Two weeks ago...

281
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,319
I check this thing like every
other day just for the kick.

282
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,624
Two weeks ago, I'm tuning in...

283
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,664
and, oh, my God...

284
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,790
there it is.

285
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,159
Whatever "it" is that's in there.

286
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,191
Whatever it is they're
guarding so carefully...

287
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,548
started talking again.

288
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,265
And I mean talking.

289
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,861
Ha, ha.

290
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,719
I have to go back...

291
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,839
to our house.

292
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,905
I need my old disks,
if they're still there.

293
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,759
I need the data to be able
to prove a baseline here...

294
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,587
that this isn't a fantasy, that
I'm not what you think I am.

295
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,225
I'm gonna find the truth...

296
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,719
and end this.

297
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,590
Whatever it takes.

298
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,987
Why can't you just let it rest?

299
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,668
Because I sent her down there, son.

300
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,519
This wasn't just a
reactor meltdown.

301
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,999
I don't wanna hear this.

302
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,348
I know. I know you don't.

303
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,789
But you can't keep running away.

304
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,429
And, son, you can't
bury this in the past.

305
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,744
What spooked them?

306
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,944
Dad, come on. Let's go.
It's only another two blocks.

307
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,581
Dad!

308
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,020
Are we going home, or what?

309
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,319
Whoa! Hey, what are you doing?

310
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,781
Dad?

311
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,466
It's clean.

312
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,300
I knew it.

313
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,709
The radiation in this place should
be lethal, but there's nothing.

314
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,020
Thank God.

315
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,382
Are they rebuilding the plant?

316
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,359
I don't know. I haven't seen...

317
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,866
<i>Ten seconds. Ten seconds.</i>

318
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,079
Seven-point-two seconds
and getting stronger.

319
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,870
We're trending exponentially.

320
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,745
That's our new curve.

321
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,547
Jesus, it's worse than we thought.

322
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,951
Excuse me, Dr. Serizawa?

323
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,839
Two men were just
arrested in the Q-zone.

324
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,879
We've got bigger problems here.
Have Dr. Graham take a look.

325
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,989
She did, sir. She sent me.

326
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,587
One of them says he used
to work here, doctor.

327
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,439
You are not fooling anybody...

328
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,279
when you say that what
happened 15 years ago...

329
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,719
Found these disks in his bag.

330
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,639
...was a natural disaster.

331
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,279
Not sure what to make of them.

332
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,999
Not an earthquake, it wasn't
a typhoon. Okay? So stop...

333
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,359
Look, I'm tired of talking
to you about this.

334
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,599
I want my son.

335
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,109
I wanna see my son. I wanna
know that he's all right.

336
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,102
This guy, this guy knows.

337
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,759
He knows where he is.

338
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,829
I want my son.

339
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,679
And I want my bag and disks.

340
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,759
And I wanna talk to somebody in
charge, not you. No, not you.

341
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,824
I'm done talking to you.

342
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,559
All right? You're looking at me right
now, like I'm in a fish tank, right?

343
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,703
Fine. Because I know
what happened here.

344
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,719
And you keep telling
everybody that this place...

345
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,959
is a death zone, but it's not.

346
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,399
You're lying.

347
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,399
Because what's really happening...

348
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,351
is that you're hiding
something out there.

349
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,024
I'm right, aren't I?

350
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,629
My wife died here!

351
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,783
Something killed my wife.

352
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,879
And I have...

353
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,625
a right to know!

354
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,908
I deserve answers!

355
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,039
All these items...

356
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,239
they were found on him.

357
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,679
- And the date. Look, 15 years ago.
- I thought all of the data...

358
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,919
from that day was lost.

359
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,187
I guess not.

360
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,748
You see?

361
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,028
You see? There it is again.

362
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,839
That is not a transformer
malfunction.

363
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,188
That is an electromagnetic pulse.

364
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,319
It affects everything electrical...

365
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,839
for miles and miles...

366
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,839
and it is happening again.

367
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,439
This is what caused everything
in the first place.

368
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,265
Don't you see that?

369
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,946
And it is gonna send us
back to the Stone Age.

370
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,181
You have no idea what's coming.

371
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,639
Pulses are seconds apart.

372
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,841
They're getting stronger.
It's affecting the power grid.

373
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,319
Any radiation leakage?

374
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,119
Gamma levels are still zero.

375
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,959
It sucked all three reactors dry.

376
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,544
It's done feeding.

377
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,079
What's this?

378
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,239
- It's the same pattern.
- Fifteen years ago...

379
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,319
- it's what caused the meltdown.
- An electromagnetic...

380
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,999
pulse. That's what it's building to.
Converting all that radiation...

381
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,919
until it hatches.

382
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,949
We have to shut down.

383
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,746
Secure the grid.

384
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,147
Wildfire protocols.

385
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,629
All personnel, clear the
first perimeter immediately!

386
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,267
What's going on?
Hey, where you going?

387
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,027
Grid's secure.

388
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,105
Kill it.

389
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,983
All readings are flatlined.

390
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,791
Ahem.

391
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,506
Get a visual.

392
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,744
Jesus. Check the grid. Hit us with
an EMP. We're losing power!

393
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,319
- Get the backup generators online.
- Working on it.

394
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,919
That pulse fried every circuit.

395
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,479
- Check the cage.
- Trying the backup generators.

396
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,827
Here we go.

397
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,221
Everybody out!

398
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,239
Now!

399
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,906
Hey! Let me out! Hey!

400
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,719
No! No, wait!

401
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,623
Stop!

402
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,021
Ford!

403
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,469
Dad!

404
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,359
<i>It was unlike anything I've
ever experienced before.</i>

405
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,359
Yeah, it's, uh, Ford Brody.

406
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,519
Japan to San Francisco.

407
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,679
Okay, could I at least... if you
could let me leave you my cell...

408
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,959
Hello?

409
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,626
Damn it!

410
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,505
I'm sorry.

411
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,062
Hey, it's okay.

412
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,310
It's okay. Daddy's gonna be okay.

413
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,630
Daddy's gonna be okay.

414
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,679
<i>This area is now under
Naval military jurisdiction.</i>

415
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,359
<i>All personnel must report...</i>

416
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,959
<i>to the duty officer for debriefing.</i>

417
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,670
Dr. Serizawa!

418
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,351
Dr. Serizawa!

419
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,279
Dr. Serizawa.

420
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,150
Captain Russell Hampton.

421
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,999
Glad to find you.
I've been briefed...

422
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,999
on your work with
Operation Monarch.

423
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,079
Now, I'm told your organization
has situational awareness...

424
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,950
of our unidentified creature?

425
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,626
Is that right?

426
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,079
We are now taking over
operational authority...

427
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,279
from Monarch. So I'm
gonna need you...

428
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,439
to come with me.

429
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,742
Is there any other
personnel you need?

430
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,239
They'll take care of you.

431
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,780
I'll be right next to you.

432
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,501
Okay.

433
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,941
Them.

434
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,879
- Let's get his vitals.
- Shh. Shh.

435
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,423
- Dad. Dad.
- Radial pulse is weak. I'm counting 125.

436
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,625
It's okay.

437
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,740
You were right.

438
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,746
I'm sorry.

439
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,184
Go home to your family.

440
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,227
You keep them safe.

441
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,909
- Okay?
- Okay.

442
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,465
Whatever it takes.

443
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,026
Whatever it ta...

444
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,984
Hey, stay with me.

445
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,159
Dad?

446
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,599
- Dad?
- Radial pulse is weaker. Barely feel it.

447
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,639
We're losing him.

448
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,999
- Joe, can you hear me?
- He's going into A-fib.

449
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,519
Give me another epi, one milligram,
and 40 units of vasopressin.

450
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,300
Stay with us. Come on, Joe.
Hang in there, buddy.

451
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,942
This is our needle in
a haystack, people.

452
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,559
MUTO.

453
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,519
Massive unidentified
terrestrial organism.

454
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,239
It is, however, no longer
terrestrial. It is airborne.

455
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,679
The world still thinks
this was an earthquake...

456
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,267
and it would be preferable
that that remain so.

457
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,599
Before we lost sight, it was
headed east across the Pacific...

458
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,799
and had emitted enough
EMP disruption...

459
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,639
to create havoc with our
radar and satellite feeds...

460
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,719
and reduce us, for the moment,
to a strictly visual pursuit.

461
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,879
I emphasize "for the moment"...

462
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,239
because we will get on our game...

463
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,429
and we will find this thing.

464
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,265
It is imperative that we do so.

465
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,279
Captain, I want any...

466
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,789
- and all search options on this table ASAP.
- Yes, sir.

467
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,350
Dr. Serizawa.

468
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,747
Admiral William Stenz.

469
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,439
- Nice to meet you.
- Glad to have you on board.

470
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,901
Sensei.

471
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,461
Excuse me.

472
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,119
<i>- Authorities issued a statement...</i>
- Brody's dead.

473
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,879
<i>claiming the nuclear
contamination...</i>

474
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,151
<i>is at no risk of spreading,
even as the death toll rises.</i>

475
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,910
Lieutenant Brody?

476
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,424
Dr. Serizawa.

477
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,904
My condolences.

478
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,066
We are deeply sorry for
your loss, lieutenant.

479
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,188
But I'm afraid we need your help.

480
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,119
This is the USS Nautilus.

481
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,148
In 1954...

482
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,506
the first time a nuclear submarine
ever reached the lower depths...

483
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,639
- it awakened something.
- The Americans...

484
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,079
first thought that
it was the Russians.

485
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,382
The Russians thought
that it was them.

486
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,341
All those nuclear bomb
tests in the '50s...?

487
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,663
Not tests.

488
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,749
They were trying to kill it.

489
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,421
Him.

490
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,999
- An ancient alpha predator.
- Millions of years...

491
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,559
older than mankind.

492
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,919
From an age when the Earth...

493
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,063
was 10 times more
radioactive than today.

494
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,879
This animal and others like it...

495
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,759
consumed this radiation
as a food source.

496
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,319
As the levels on the surface
naturally subsided...

497
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,827
these creatures adapted to
live deeper in the oceans.

498
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,865
Further underground.

499
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,860
Absorbing radiation
from the planet's core.

500
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,439
The organization we work for,
Monarch, was established...

501
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,504
in the wake of this discovery.

502
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,639
A multinational coalition...

503
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,271
formed in secrecy...

504
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,709
to search for him.

505
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,186
Study him.

506
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,264
Learn everything we could.

507
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,221
We call him...

508
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,399
<i>Gojira.</i>

509
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,479
The top of...

510
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,509
a primordial ecosystem.

511
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,669
A god, for all intents
and purposes.

512
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,799
- A monster.
- Fifteen years ago...

513
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,599
we found a fossil of another
giant animal in the Philippines.

514
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,839
Like Gojira. But this creature...

515
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,279
died long ago.

516
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,389
Killed by these.

517
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,225
Parasitic spores.

518
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,159
One dormant. But the other hatched.
Catalyzed when a mining company...

519
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,542
unknowingly drilled into its tomb.

520
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,639
The hatchling burrowed straight for
the nearest source of radiation...

521
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,439
your father's power
plant in Janjira...

522
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,439
and cocooned there for 15 years,
absorbing its radioactive fuel...

523
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,439
- to gestate, to grow.
- Until it hatched...

524
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,079
like a butterfly into the
creature you saw today.

525
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,159
Wait. You knew about this?

526
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,479
This thing? The whole time?
Why didn't you...

527
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,599
- kill it when you had the chance?
- It was absorbing...

528
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,999
radiation from the reactors.

529
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,359
We worried killing it...

530
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,519
might release that radiation
and endanger millions.

531
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,199
That's why our mission
was to contain it.

532
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,424
To study its biology,
to understand it.

533
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,799
We knew the creature was
having an electrical effect...

534
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,079
on everything within
a close proximity.

535
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,279
What we didn't know...

536
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,879
was that it could harness
this same power...

537
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,262
in an EMP attack.

538
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,585
But your father did.

539
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,639
He predicted it.

540
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,829
What else did he say?

541
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,399
Please try to remember, Mr. Brody.

542
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,959
Anything that would help us.
Anything at all.

543
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,750
I didn't listen.

544
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,309
I just thought he was crazy.

545
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,159
He was obsessed with all this...

546
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,986
Said something about
an animal call.

547
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,831
Something talking.

548
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,501
Talking?

549
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,189
He said he was studying something.

550
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,225
Echolocation.

551
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,461
If the MUTO was talking that day...

552
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:38,383
your father must have discovered
something talking back.

553
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,986
- Check again.
- Yup.

554
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,719
Search for a response call.

555
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,670
This parasite.

556
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,439
It's still out there.
Where's it headed?

557
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,279
The MUTO is young...

558
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,581
growing.

559
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,425
It will be looking for food.

560
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,759
Sources of radiation.

561
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,301
We're monitoring all known sites...

562
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,266
but if we don't find it soon...

563
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,271
Then what?

564
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,945
Nature has an order.

565
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,390
A power to restore balance.

566
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,709
I believe he is that power.

567
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,319
Sir, right now we're
50 miles from Hawaii.

568
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,907
This transport will take you there.

569
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:26,221
You're catching a commercial
flight back to San Francisco.

570
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,547
I'm gonna need you
to brush your teeth.

571
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,879
- Disgusting! Those are terrible!
- Ha, ha.

572
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,119
We gotta brush them!

573
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,159
<i>Citizens within a
100-mile radius...</i>

574
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,319
<i>are being temporarily
evacuated from the area.</i>

575
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,104
<i>Hey, this is Elle. You missed me.
Please leave a message.</i>

576
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,866
Elle.

577
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,959
I don't know what they're
saying on the news.

578
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,501
There was an accident in Japan.

579
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,991
Dad's gone.

580
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,869
I'll explain when I see you.

581
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,584
I'm headed to Hawaii. I'm gonna
catch a flight from there.

582
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,670
I'll see you soon.

583
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,585
Keep scrolling.

584
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,861
Near the end. Before the EMP.

585
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,628
There.

586
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,864
Something responded.

587
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,759
<i>Aloha, and welcome aboard.</i>

588
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,239
<i>The train will begin
moving shortly.</i>

589
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,783
<i>For the comfort of others,
no smoking, please. Thank you.</i>

590
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,599
<i>Please remember to stay
clear of the automatic doors.</i>

591
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,959
Akio!

592
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,479
Mama!

593
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,303
Mama!

594
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,141
Hey, hey, hey.

595
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,983
Mama!

596
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,879
I can't open it. Look, don't
worry. Just wait there.

597
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,839
I'll bring him back.

598
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,799
Okay?

599
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,101
- Mama!
- Hey, hey.

600
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,319
Mama!

601
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,399
- Whoa. Hey. Whoa, kid.
- Mama!

602
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,589
It's okay. I'm gonna
bring him back.

603
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,719
All right. I'm gonna
set you down there.

604
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,119
I'll get you back to your parents.

605
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,182
Okay?

606
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,226
Here. Is this what you want?

607
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,582
Take good care of him for me.

608
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,951
I better not miss my flight, kid.

609
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,959
Admiral, received an intel report.

610
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,279
We lost track of a nuclear Akula 50
nautical miles northwest of Hawaii.

611
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,866
Could be the MUTO.

612
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,223
Just got word of a missing Russian
sub in the North Pacific.

613
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,159
Martinez?

614
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,239
Aye. Special Forces Team Sparta
1 is picking up a distress signal...

615
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,519
northwest of Diamond Head
on the island of Oahu.

616
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,559
They're on the ground,
headed to the beacon.

617
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,719
...on 5.23 north-northeast...

618
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,307
<i>of the last beacon.
Moving in on foot.</i>

619
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,319
Wanna tell me why we're looking...

620
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,999
for an Akula in the jungle?

621
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,159
Probably a glitch.
Russians said they...

622
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,719
got a ping from this location.

623
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,119
Hey, I got a reading.
It's right up ahead.

624
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,159
<i>Sparta 1, this is Hawkeye.</i>

625
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,719
<i>We're getting the same ping off
the transponder. Range 30 meters.</i>

626
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,624
<i>Looks like you're getting warm.</i>

627
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,239
What the hell?

628
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,230
Jesus.

629
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,190
Oh, my God.

630
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,189
Guardian 3, we located
your Russian sub.

631
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,879
<i>You're not gonna believe
what else we found.</i>

632
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,102
Holy shit.

633
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,959
<i>It appears to be rising
approximately 20 to 30 meters...</i>

634
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,239
<i>above the tree line.</i>

635
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,039
<i>We can't tell how wide it is.</i>

636
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,959
Cat's out of the bag, doctor.
No more secrets.

637
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,399
Our highest priority now is safety.

638
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,146
There's close to a million
people on that island.

639
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,999
Get me eyes in the air.

640
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,319
We're picking up something else.
Approaching from the Pacific.

641
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,439
We need to check out that object.

642
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,879
General quarters.

643
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,879
Bridge, this is the captain.

644
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,199
- Where you going?
- Up to the flight deck.

645
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,799
I think he is coming.

646
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,199
What are you doing?

647
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,150
I have to see this.

648
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,425
Whoa.

649
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:08,541
Two Charlie Six, we are circling
the target. Go on your command.

650
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,665
Stand by, got a visual.
Bogey at my 12.

651
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,399
Be advised. Prepare
to engage target.

652
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,439
We're getting movement...

653
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,707
down here.

654
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,748
Take cover!

655
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,839
Control, I have...

656
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,869
no power. I say again,
I've lost all...

657
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,431
You all right?

658
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,941
You give it 10 seconds,
lights gonna come back on.

659
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,351
It's okay.

660
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,261
- What was that?
- Did you see that?

661
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,950
What is it?

662
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,987
Dad!

663
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,981
Zoe?

664
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,781
Zoe!

665
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,385
Oh, my God.

666
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,159
Run. Run! Tsunami! Tsunami!

667
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,319
<i>Target spotted offshore...</i>

668
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,941
two knots due east of your position.
Could be a second bogey.

669
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,239
Anybody hurt?

670
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,759
- Anyone get an eyeball on the bogey?
- Where is he?

671
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,159
There you go.

672
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,666
What did I tell you?

673
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,308
<i>... please. Thank you.</i>

674
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,079
Get down!

675
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,143
Let's go!

676
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,479
<i>Remember to stay...</i>

677
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,702
<i>clear of the doors.</i>

678
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,591
Go, go, go!

679
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,879
<i>Target in sight...</i>

680
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,548
- ...two o'clock, 300 meters.
- We're on 6-X-01. Target confirmed.

681
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,821
Jesus!

682
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,061
<i>Can you tell us what happened?</i>

683
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:38,067
<i>...and everybody started
running and screaming.</i>

684
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,267
Sam, please turn that TV off.

685
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,199
Hey, did you hear me?

686
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,581
Off.

687
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,666
Come on, Sammy. Let's go.

688
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,631
Let's go. It's bedtime.

689
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,399
- Sammy.
- Mommy, look.

690
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,509
Dinosaurs.

691
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,919
<i>Attention, please.
Incoming patients...</i>

692
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,599
<i>- please proceed...</i>
- Excuse me.

693
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,239
Hi. Excuse me. I'm sorry.

694
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,479
This boy's been separated
from his parents.

695
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,599
Fill this out. Be with you...

696
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,140
in just a minute.

697
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,999
Hey, you got service
on that cell phone?

698
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,064
No. The pay phones don't even work.

699
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,547
- Akio!
- Akio!

700
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,465
Mama! Papa!

701
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,624
Corporal, load up, load up.

702
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,999
Sergeant. Lieutenant
Brody, U.S. Navy.

703
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,639
I need your help. I'm trying
to get to the mainland.

704
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,559
It's your lucky day. Everything
not tied down is moving east.

705
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,988
- Whoa, is that where they're heading?
- Yeah.

706
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,509
I guess we're monster hunters now.

707
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,341
<i>Satellite transfer complete.</i>

708
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,479

Last satellite tracks predict

All our models have the targets
converging on the Pacific Coast.

712

As of now, it looks like Godzilla's
still following the MUTO.

713
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,666
He's hunting.

714
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,799
Have all vessels maintain
current distance from target.

715
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,279
And plot the speed and
heading of these things.

716
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,119
I wanna know exactly when and
where they'll make landfall.

717
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,639
Yes, sir.

718
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,829
Doctor, what did you
mean by "hunting"?

719
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,639
You think it's chasing this MUTO?

720
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,679
But if the MUTO is his prey...

721
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,439
The signal shows a call.

722
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,719
- Why call up a predator?
- No, it didn't.

723
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,879
I think Godzilla...

724
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,466
was only listening.

725
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,586
The MUTO was calling
something else.

726
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,706
The pattern.

727
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,239
Focus the search on Nevada.

728
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,319
Nevada? Why would it go to Nevada?

729
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,239
- It can't be. It's impossible.
- What's impossible?

730
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:40,386
There was another spore, intact,
found in the Philippine mine.

731
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,599
But we vivisected it.

732
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,639
Ran every test on it for years.

733
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,639
You confirmed it for yourself.
It was dormant!

734
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,479
Maybe not anymore.

735
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,879
This spore. Where
is it now, doctor?

736
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,879
It was highly radioactive.
It was disposed of.

737
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,519
The Americans, they took it.

738
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,424
Doctor, where is it?

739
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,705
Where you put all
your nuclear waste.

740
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,270
Go, go, go!

741
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,399
Right, let's go!
Give me a Mark I...

742
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,701
eyeball on every vault.

743
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,423
Clear!

744
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,261
Clear!

745
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,239
Clear!

746
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,349
- Clear!
- Clear!

747
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,502
Clear!

748
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,302
- Clear!
- Clear!

749
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,341
Hey!

750
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,879
Is anyone in there?

751
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,119
<i>Captain, our UAVs have
footage of the new MUTO.</i>

752
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,319
<i>Let's have a look.</i>

753
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,621
Yes, sir.

754
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,319
This is from five minutes ago.

755
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,985
My God.

756
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,031
Playing all we have now.

757
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,945
It's almost 300 feet.

758
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,144
It's far bigger than the other one.

759
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,464
But this one doesn't
have any wings.

760
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,425
A different sex?

761
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,746
A female.

762
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,944
That's who he's been talking to.

763
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,919
It must be a mating call.

764
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,826
The female remained dormant
until the male matured.

765
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,304
Now they're seeking radiation.

766
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,145
To reproduce.

767
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,919
Current tracking models indicate that
all three targets are converging here:

768
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,221
San Francisco Bay.

769
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:07,709
But if we rig a nuclear warhead
with a shielded timer...

770
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,199
put it on a boat and send it...

771
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,439
20 miles out...

772
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,504
the radiation lures the MUTOs...

773
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,799
and the MUTOs lure Godzilla.

774
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:18,039
And we detonate, with minimal
fallout risk to the city.

775
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,079
You can't be serious.
They feed on radiation.

776
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,759
Correct. That's why we
use the bomb as bait.

777
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,119
And kill them...

778
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:28,344
- ...with the sheer force of the blast.
- This is crazy.

779
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:31,599
Doctor, if you have any
other ideas, I am all ears.

780
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,140
Admiral.

781
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,231
Yes, doctor?

782
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,305
Gojira may be the answer.

783
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,519
I believe...

784
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,266
he's here to restore balance.

785
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,279
He can defeat them.

786
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,079
And what? We just
stand by and watch?

787
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:51,304
I'm sorry, doctor.
I can't take that risk.

788
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,999
Prep the warheads and get
them moving to the coast.

789
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,904
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

790
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,545
I know you don't agree with this.

791
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,628
But my first priority is
to safeguard our citizens.

792
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,159
It's stopped.

793
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,461
Yes.

794
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,719
Eight-fifteen in the morning.

795
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:33,149
August 6, 1945.

796
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,425
Hiroshima.

797
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,590
It was my father's.

798
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,559
Heads up.

799
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,799
We've got new
destination, new orders.

800
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,959
Let's get geared up.

801
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,199
Hey, tech sergeant.

802
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,501
What's the word?

803
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,231
Another one of those things
popped up in Nevada, sir.

804
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,983
Okay, everybody out.

805
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,384
Can't fly any further.

806
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,599
We're well in range of its EMP.

807
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,399
So from here on out, it's on the
ground or it's not at all. Let's go!

808
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:54,879
All right, listen up!

809
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,519
This train and these weapons
are headed to San Francisco.

810
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,300
Anyone not part of this
mission, disembark now!

811
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,479
<i>Negative.</i>

812
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:07,599
Can't do it, sir.

813
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,559
This is a high-risk mission. That train
is a national asset, not Amtrak.

814
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,119
- We good to go?
- Just about.

815
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:16,159
From the look of the casings
on those Minuteman ICBMs...

816
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:20,465
guessing the digital module's been bypassed
and you're prepping for full analog retrofit.

817
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,359
Is my jaw supposed to drop?

818
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,079
I get it. You're EOD.

819
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,719
- I got my crew, they know what they're doing.
- Aim the pointy end...

820
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,590
at the monsters, right, sarge?

821
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:34,469
When was the last time you let one of your
guys put their fingers in a live bomb?

822
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,719
Look, this is what I do.

823
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,385
This is my job.

824
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,065
Master sergeant.

825
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,349
My family's in the city.

826
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,307
Okay? I need to get on that train.

827
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,279
<i>You heard the spokesman say...</i>

828
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:55,663
<i>that the White House has not ruled
out the use of nuclear force.</i>

829
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,708
Sam, your mom's gonna
be right back.

830
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,824
Emergency, can I help you?

831
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,341
Hello?

832
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,190
Oh, yeah, just a sec.

833
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:08,919
Elle, for you.

834
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,541
- Tell them I'll be there in a minute.
- Elle.

835
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,425
It's your husband.

836
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,519
Hello?

837
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:19,867
Elle?

838
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,026
<i>Ford?</i>

839
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,519
<i>Oh, God.</i>

840
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,599
<i>- You all right? How's Sam?</i>
- I've been calling you everywhere.

841
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,879
- You okay?
<i>- I'm fine.</i>

842
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:31,319
- I've got Sam with me.
<i>- Great. Because I wanna get you both...</i>

843
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,065
Can't believe this is happening.

844
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,239
<i>Ford.</i>

845
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:36,905
<i>You okay? Are you doing okay?</i>

846
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,479
<i>I'm okay. Elle, please don't worry.</i>

847
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,679
Baby, I'm so scared right now.

848
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:42,708
<i>I know.</i>

849
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,901
I'm gonna be at the
hospital by sunrise.

850
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,110
Then I'll get you and Sam out.

851
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:50,759
Okay.

852
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,188
<i>The military has a plan to
deal with these things.</i>

853
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,279
<i>I'm coming to get you both, okay?</i>

854
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,866
Okay.

855
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,239
Can you please just hurry?

856
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,599
<i>I will.</i>

857
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,583
<i>Elle?</i>

858
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,867
I just wanted you to
know that I love you.

859
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,903
I love you too. Just be safe.

860
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,506
I'll see you soon.

861
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,943
Good to go! Let's move out!

862
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,839
<i>As blackouts and
electrical interference...</i>

863
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,599
<i>radiate farther and farther west...</i>

864
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,439
<i>citizens within 200 miles of the
creature's current sphere of influence...</i>

865
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,719
<i>are being urged to
please find shelter...</i>

866
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:46,279
<i>stay indoors and
stay off the roads.</i>

867
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:48,309
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

868
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,879
<i>...kids in the car.</i>

869
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,519
<i>...debris going back
about two miles.</i>

870
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,983
<i>This girl is not breathing.</i>

871
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:01,271
<i>...people that are hurt.
Send somebody out here now!</i>

872
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,061
Yes, sir.

873
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,547
Yes, warheads are on the move.

874
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,704
I completely agree, sir.

875
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,319
All right, people. Let's go.

876
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:22,199
I need to know the exact
location of the MUTOs ASAP.

877
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:25,679
Aye. We're updating our models with
the current tracking data now.

878
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,106
Admiral.

879
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,861
Yes?

880
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,350
Please don't do this.

881
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,468
I understand your concerns, doctor.

882
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,319
But I am sacrificing lives...

883
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:42,959
every minute trying to steer one of these
things clear of population centers...

884
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,864
and now there are two
more on the way.

885
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,759
There are millions of lives at risk.
So all I want to know...

886
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:49,999
from you is:

887
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,667
Will it work and can
they be killed?

888
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,039
But we tried that before.

889
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,919
We're talking dialable yield.
Megatons, not kilotons.

890
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,759
Nothing can withstand that blast.

891
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,462
Makes the bomb we tried to kill it
with in '54 look like a firecracker.

892
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:22,199
- Sergeant Morales. Give me a hand.
- I thought these nukes...

893
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,119
- all detonated by remote control.
- The MUTOs knock out...

894
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,479
everything electric.

895
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,319
Including detonators.

896
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,305
Can't even get in range without
these things going haywire.

897
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,639
But this?

898
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,279
This, on the other
hand, is old-school.

899
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,679
Clockwork.

900
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:37,919
Takes a licking...

901
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,460
- keeps on ticking.
- Heh.

902
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,279
Holy shit.

903
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:01,221
Sergeant Morales, get down here with
that radio. On the double. Move, move!

904
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,599
Snake Eyes, this is Bravo to
November. Is the bridge...

905
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,919
clear? Over.

906
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,159
I say again:

907
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,079
We got a train of VIP cargo...

908
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,111
headed for the coast. Is
the bridge clear? Over.

909
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,439
Snake Eyes, I need a sitrep.

910
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,079
Are the tracks clear?

911
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:29,239
We are at phase line yellow. In the next 10
mikes, we're advancing to phase line red.

912
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,959
Secure or not? Over.

913
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,425
You think it's intact?

914
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,959
Only one way to find out.

915
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,719
- You wanna take the top?
- Sure.

916
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,546
You check below. Sergeant
Morales, you come with me.

917
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:30,828
Shit.

918
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,425
Jesus.

919
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:52,466
- Jones, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm good!

920
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:13,919
The bridge is intact.

921
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,359
Bulldog, this is Eagle.

922
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,999
All clear to move out. Over.

923
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,825
<i>Roger that, Eagle.</i>

924
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,663
Let's go! Let's go, people!

925
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,159
Say again.

926
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:32,384
I do not have a visual.
What is your position? Over.

927
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:35,307
Unreadable. Say again. Over.

928
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,031
Hit the deck.

929
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:13,959
Help me turn it off, man.

930
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,903
Run!

931
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,079
Move it, run!

932
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,226
Ford! Aah!

933
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,679
<i>He's going under!</i>

934
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,999
Boats, sound the collision alarm.

935
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,711
Frame 180.

936
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,544
We're losing visual, admiral.

937
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,226
He's diving.

938
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:07,479
Changing course and moving fast. I've got
him at 33 knots and picking up speed.

939
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,191
He's gonna outrun us, sir.

940
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,479
Watch the swinging!

941
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,066
No swing!

942
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,063
Hey!

943
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,501
Hold on!

944
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,346
Medic!

945
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:23,959
<i>They are insisting civilians make
their way to the BART stations.</i>

946
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:26,839
<i>BART stations are
designated shelters.</i>

947
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:30,119
These patients are my responsibility.
Where are you taking them?

948
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,519
Across the bridges.
Critical and children only.

949
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:36,506
Shelters are gonna fill up fast. Trust
me, they'll be safer outside the city.

950
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,999
- I can take Sam.
- No, no, no.

951
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,999
Ford's on his way.

952
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,951
If you change your mind,
the buses leave in 10 minutes.

953
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:46,704
Come on. Where are you, Ford?

954
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,144
This way! Keep them moving!

955
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,865
Let's go. Come on, come on.

956
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:04,639
Hey! Where are they taking it?

957
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:07,479
Twenty miles offshore,
convergence point.

958
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,623
We're gonna lure them there.

959
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:12,462
Three birds, one stone.

960
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,501
Wait!

961
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:41,879
Okay, Sammy.

962
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,359
Laura, thank God.

963
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:46,504
Sammy, you remember Laura.
She's Mommy's work friend, right?

964
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,999
She's gonna look after
you for a little bit.

965
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,479
Daddy's gonna be here soon.

966
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,959
And I'm gonna just come
get you right after.

967
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,399
I promise.

968
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,747
Okay.

969
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,341
Okay?

970
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,319
Come on, sweetheart.
You're gonna come with me.

971
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,110
Your mom's gonna stay and help.

972
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,439
Elle, I'm gonna take
care of him, okay?

973
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:10,391
- Say, "Bye-bye, Mommy."
- Bye, Mommy.

974
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,959
I got him! I got him!

975
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,439
Just sit down here.

976
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:43,901
Sit, sit.

977
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:45,719
Here.

978
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:47,159
Did you lose consciousness?

979
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,781
I'm okay. Really, I'm fine.

980
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:55,799
Sitrep, please.
Location of targets?

981
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:58,639
Male MUTO was spotted 30 miles
off the Farallon Islands.

982
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,399
Showing seismic activity to
the east near Livermore.

983
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,159
Should be the female closing in.

984
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:04,039
Where's Godzilla?

985
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:05,759
Last contact was five hours ago.

986
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:09,279
Maintaining a bearing of 053 degrees,
descending below a depth of 10,000 feet.

987
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,519
Be here within the hour.

988
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:13,869
<i>Residents are trying to get out
of the city any way they can.</i>

989
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:17,144
There's still buses on that bridge.

990
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,159
Come on!

991
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:29,109
Let's get those busses
through. Let's go!

992
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:36,479
We're not gonna stop
the buses here.

993
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,519
What?

994
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,959
I can't hear you. Oh, kids...

995
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,750
please be quiet.

996
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:05,079
Move into position till you
have a clean line of sight!

997
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,262
Portside! Two hundred meters!

998
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,581
Brace!

999
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:11,759
Hold your fire.

1000
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,471
Hold your fire.

1001
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,864
Holy shit.

1002
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:28,639
Oh, shit!

1003
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:31,341
- Hold on!
- Watch out!

1004
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,065
Fire! Fire! Fire!

1005
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:39,502
Look out!

1006
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,630
Get down! Get down in your seats!

1007
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:42,867
Please! Get down!

1008
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,667
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

1009
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,182
Hey!

1010
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,623
Move out! Move, move, move!

1011
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:04,869
Striker! There's civilians on
the bridge. Hold your fire!

1012
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,239
Open fire!

1013
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:30,959
Move! Move!

1014
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:01,839
- All right, get in there!
- Prepare to arm the device!

1015
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:04,984
Ready! You got it?

1016
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,180
I'm all set.

1017
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,226
Arming keys!

1018
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,959
Three! Two! One!

1019
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,039
What the hell was that?

1020
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:31,199
EMP.

1021
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,628
Engine's stopped! We lost power!

1022
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:17,383
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1023
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:24,022
- Fire!
- Incoming!

1024
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:04,359
Sam Brody was checked into the Oakland
Coliseum shelter an hour ago. He is safe.

1025
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:07,199
No record of Elle Brody.
Never made it out of the city.

1026
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:11,439
Well, check again. Please. I told her
to wait for me, and I didn't make it.

1027
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:14,639
They are trying to get everyone
downtown into subway shelters.

1028
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:16,559
I'm sure your wife is fine.

1029
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:21,119
Lieutenant Brody!

1030
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,422
I'm looking for Lieutenant Brody.

1031
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:26,039
- Are you Brody?
- Yes.

1032
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:29,344
Okay. The male delivered the
warhead to the center of downtown.

1033
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:32,919
That puts 100,000 civilians
in the blast radius.

1034
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:34,079
We can't stop it remotely.

1035
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:38,359
An analog timer has been installed. The MUTOs
are frying electronics within a five-mile bubble.

1036
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:40,389
Means approaching from
ground is not an option.

1037
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:43,479
That's why we'll be conducting a
HALO insertion. Jumping altitude...

1038
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:45,159
Will be 30,000 feet.

1039
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:47,839
We just skate to the top and drop.
Here.

1040
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:51,959
And here. If you don't hit a skyscraper
on the way, meet at rally point Charlie.

1041
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:54,879
- Right here. Good?
- Doctor, any guesses where to look?

1042
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,386
Underground.

1043
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,319
If the MUTOs have spawned...

1044
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,224
they'll be building a nest.

1045
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:04,039
Captain, when you
find the warhead...

1046
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:06,159
- how long to disarm it?
- Without seeing...

1047
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,319
- the analog mod, I couldn't even guess.
- Sixty seconds...

1048
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:11,065
if I can access it.

1049
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,070
I retrofitted that device myself.

1050
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:14,919
Lieutenant Brody is our only...

1051
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:17,268
EOD tech to survive
the train attack.

1052
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:19,384
Well, it sounds like
we could use you.

1053
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,719
With all due respect...

1054
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:24,879
- if that doesn't work, then what's Plan B?
- The waterfront...

1055
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:27,039
is located one klick downhill.

1056
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,239
Get the bomb to the
pier, onto a boat...

1057
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:32,589
and as far away from the city as
possible before it detonates.

1058
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:37,705
Any questions?

1059
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,679
- Dismissed.
- That's it.

1060
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:40,981
Let's move.

1061
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,506
Lieutenant?

1062
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:45,519
They've already been briefed.

1063
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,399
We have no extraction plan.

1064
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:50,943
If you don't walk out,
you don't come back at all.

1065
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:53,749
Sir, I'll do whatever it takes.

1066
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:14,586
This alpha predator
of yours, doctor...

1067
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,221
do you really think
he has a chance?

1068
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:24,471
The arrogance of man is thinking
nature is in our control...

1069
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,783
and not the other way around.

1070
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:33,144
Let them fight.

1071
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,239
Oh, Lord God, we give thanks...

1072
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:31,359
for the opportunities
you have given us...

1073
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:34,479
going together as comrades
to defend our great nation.

1074
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:37,999
We thank you for the time and service
that you have given us together.

1075
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,239
Now as we are about to
leave one another...

1076
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,463
let us have the strength...

1077
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:31,746
Take position! Take position!

1078
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:35,431
I saw Team 1 move to the east.

1079
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:39,879
Two of our team members didn't make it.
I heard bits and pieces on the radio.

1080
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:41,864
Snipers on the rooftop
moving into position.

1081
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,759
Here we go. Picking up the nuke.

1082
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:44,599
Which way?

1083
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:45,999
One klick up the hill.

1084
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,159
We found the warhead.

1085
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:49,622
Let's go! Up the hill,
this direction. Move.

1086
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:15,231
Hey. Hey.

1087
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:16,746
Look.

1088
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:30,239
Let's move, let's move.

1089
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:31,701
On my six.

1090
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:01,100
Sarge, get a look at this.

1091
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,319
We gotta get moving.
You got a signal yet?

1092
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,587
I got it.

1093
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:10,662
It's down there.

1094
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:20,627
All right, move, move!

1095
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:30,751
Grab a line!

1096
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:36,785
More light. Grazer.

1097
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:01,759
Right, clear out.

1098
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:02,902
Here we go.

1099
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,946
Whoa, look out, heads up!

1100
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:06,821
How much time we got left?

1101
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,223
We have 27 mikes.

1102
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:13,709
We gotta get this thing down.

1103
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:44,519
Move, move, I got you!

1104
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:46,026
Move it out, move it out!

1105
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:21,799
Careful! Careful.

1106
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:23,519
And down in three...

1107
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:24,319
two...

1108
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:25,667
one.

1109
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:27,119
Let's get this cover off.

1110
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:28,262
Lieutenant, you're up.

1111
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,559
It's not budging. It's sealed shut.

1112
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:36,719
We need time to open it.

1113
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:37,839
We don't have time!

1114
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,439
We gotta get it on a boat.

1115
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:41,279
Grab the warhead! Let's move!

1116
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:42,547
Go!

1117
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:44,868
Easy.

1118
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:47,342
Easy, easy.

1119
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,190
Move it out, guys!

1120
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:56,079
Lieutenant, let's go!

1121
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:36,546
Lieutenant?

1122
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:32,759
What the hell was that?

1123
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:34,505
Holy shit! Did you see that?

1124
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:56,906
This way.

1125
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:00,671
Faster, faster.

1126
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:04,305
Let's get this thing started.

1127
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:07,626
Find the ignition, sir?

1128
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:09,345
Give me that pack.

1129
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:10,986
Here you go.

1130
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,639
Come on, come on. Hurry.

1131
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:42,909
Hurry it up. Let's go, let's go!

1132
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,790
She's coming for the bomb!

1133
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:51,142
Let's get this weapon secured.

1134
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,621
Unh! Come on.

1135
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:40,261
Come on.

1136
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,745
Stay right here.

1137
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,781
Quiet!

1138
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,347
Quiet!

1139
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:16,228
I hear some people. Come on!

1140
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:20,319
This one's in bad shape. Come
on, grab my hand. We got you.

1141
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:22,279
Help him up. Help him up.

1142
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:25,119
<i>Attention, new arrivals:</i>

1143
01:53:25,120 --> 01:53:27,879

marked tables...</i>

1144
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:30,519

- Let's make some room, please!

1145
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:31,867
Mary!

1146
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:33,239
Daddy!

1147
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:15,981
Sam.

1148
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:22,239
Mommy!

1149
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:23,587
Sammy?

1150
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:28,239
Mommy! Mommy!

1151
01:54:28,240 --> 01:54:29,905
Sweetpea.

1152
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:32,430
Hi!

1153
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:35,270
Hi, baby.

1154
01:54:56,840 --> 01:54:58,187
Hi.

1155
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,479
Oh, baby.
