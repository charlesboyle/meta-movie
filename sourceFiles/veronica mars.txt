1
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,282
I need your help, Veronica.

2
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,768
- You can't tell anyone.
- I need your help.

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,921
I need to know.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,207
A teenaged private eye.

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,364
Trust me, I know how dumb that sounds.

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,127
But it's not like I found a decoder ring
at the bottom of a cereal box...

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,886
...and thought, "That sounds like fun."

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,850
I wish. That would've been adorable.

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,849
Nope. My best friend was murdered
when I was 15.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,766
Trying to figure out who did it
was how I coped.

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,245
My dad was sheriff at the time.

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,722
And when he went after
the most powerful man in town...

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,690
...he turned us both into pariahs.

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,362
Dad lost his job and I lost my friends.

15
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,206
Kids can be cruel, after all.

16
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,490
The cruelest was Logan Echolls,
my dead friend's boyfriend.

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,486
Like me, Logan was fueled
by rage and distrust.

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,450
He wanted to make someone pay.

19
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,681
It's likely those qualities
are what drew us together.

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,968
They're absolutely what tore us apart.

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,851
After my dad was run out of office,
he got his Pl license and opened an agency.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,322
I hung out there to learn the tricks
of the trade.

23
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,765
There was plenty of work for both of us
in the seedy beach town of Neptune, California.

24
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,321
People might think of Neptune as glamorous.

25
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,643
Home to movie stars
and captains of industry.

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,885
But when the class war comes,
Neptune will be ground zero.

27
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,883
It's a Springsteen song:

28
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,122
Get out while you're young.

29
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,401
I got out when I was 19,
leaving a trail of destruction in my wake.

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,244
I've grown up, though.

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,645
That was the old me.
Angry me. Vengeful me.

32
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,091
New me?
People say I'm a marshmallow.

33
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,161
So a year at Hearst College.

34
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,766
BA in Psychology from Stanford.

35
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,691
Near the top of your class
at Columbia Law.

36
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,850
You're due to take the bar in six weeks.

37
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,127
A little about us:

38
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,811
We're a multinational firm.

39
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,289
Fifty lawyers in New York.

40
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,490
Our clients here at Truman-Mann
are primarily Fortune 500 companies.

41
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,884
Our job is to make sure that frivolous lawsuits
disappear before they reach the courtroom.

42
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,489
We're looking at a number of candidates.

43
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,923
All with impressive résumés...

44
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,767
...but none quite as unique as yours.

45
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,923
You were issued a private investigator's
license for your 18th birthday?

46
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,964
Heh. Is that something California kids do?

47
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,049
My dad is a PI. I worked for him.

48
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,491
It was more answering phones
and handling his travel than anything else.

49
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,282
Really? Before you were 20,
your name popped up on LexisNexis in 14...

50
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,487
Fifteen.

51
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,445
Fifteen separate articles or briefs...

52
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,008
...in cases ranging from multiple homicides
to dognapping.

53
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,210
You have a degree in psychology,
Miss Mars.

54
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,184
What do you think that says
about a person?

55
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,171
Compulsive, clearly.

56
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,646
Addictive personality.

57
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,684
Possible adrenaline junkie.

58
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,370
But that's not me anymore.

59
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,807
I haven't worked a case
since I transferred to Stanford.

60
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,041
And why is that?

61
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,727
The price was too high.

62
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,367
It ruined friendships and relationships.

63
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,848
Cost me a lot of opportunities
along the way.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,890
So your decision to transfer
wasn't related...

65
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,886
...to a certain video of you
and another Hearst student?

66
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,601
- The sex tape? No need to be coy.
- Leonard.

67
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,890
It's fine. As lawyers, we are often put
in adversarial situations.

68
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,442
Opposing counsel will seek to exploit
any perceived weakness.

69
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,529
All I'll say about that tape, is it was made
and distributed without my knowledge.

70
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,491
And I'll ask you:

71
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,651
Do I look ruffled?

72
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,484
Rebuilding her life took time.

73
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,768
More time than you'd think.

74
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,845
Zhi Howes was broke.
And worse, people considered her passe.

75
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,203
She thought about restarting her moribund
career with a Kickstarter campaign...

76
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,443
...but the potential for further
humiliation was daunting.

77
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,885
They brought up the sex tape?

78
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,045
I think I handled it okay. I have another meeting
tomorrow with one of the partners.

79
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,770
I hope we talk STDs.

80
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,849
- What?
- Wallace.

81
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,964
He keeps trying to get me to come in
for our 10-year reunion.

82
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,964
"Not bloody likely."

83
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,360
- Hey, Piz.
- Yeah.

84
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,761
The Zhi Howes story.
How long is it gonna be now?

85
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,924
- Uh, 12 and a half minutes.
- You're killing me.

86
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,531
- Hi.
- Hi.

87
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,366
You must be the girlfriend
who we have heard so much about...

88
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,567
...and never seen.

89
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,241
I am. Law school.

90
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,609
- Mm.
- Um, I'm a really big fan of the show, though.

91
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,441
Funny story.
I do a pretty wicked impression of you.

92
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,841
I don't think we...
I don't think it's a good idea.

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,447
Uh, we dated for months in college,
and this whole last year...

94
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,246
...and she's only meeting my parents
for the first time next week.

95
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,088
She blames law school for that too.
So the fact that she hasn't met my colleagues...

96
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,126
Veronica?

97
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,840
Bonnie DeVille was found dead
in her bathtub.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,570
Oh, that's awful.

99
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,564
You a fan?

100
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,723
I went to high school with her.

101
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,645
She was Carrie Bishop back then.

102
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,881
<i>A long time ago</i>

103
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,121
<i>We used to be friends</i>

104
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,963
<i>But I haven't thought of you lately at all</i>

105
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,090
<i>If ever again
A greeting I send to you</i>

106
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,485
<i>Short and sweet to the soul is all I intend</i>

107
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,087
I haven't seen or spoken to
Logan in nine years.

108
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,446
Veronica!

109
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,605
I heard he got his life together.
Then, suddenly, he's all over the gossip pages.

110
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,247
"Son of a movie star dates pop star."

111
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,210
"Son of a movie star beats up paparazzi."

112
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,809
"Caught on camera: Son of a movie star
threatens celebrity girlfriend's life."

113
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,001
De Ville was electrocuted in her bathtub.

114
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,627
Local authorities have ruled
the singer's death a homicide...

115
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,930
...and are focusing their investigation
on ex-boyfriend, Logan Echolls.

116
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,765
When I was a kid,
Dad stuck a magnet on our fridge...

117
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,606
...suggesting we accept the things
we cannot change.

118
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,331
I thought it was there
for my alcoholic Mom's benefit...

119
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,000
...but it stayed up long after
Mom was gone.

120
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,846
Sheriff Lamb, is it true that Logan Echolls
was in the house when Bonnie died?

121
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,090
We found Echolls passed out
next to DeVille's body.

122
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,203
Sheriff, are you aware of the video...

123
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,964
...of Logan Echolls threatening Bonnie?

124
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,049
Get out. You're not welcome here.

125
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,807
You get rid of him,
or you're gonna end up dead.

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,525
Kind of speaks for itself.

127
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,205
Can you speak to the tragedy...

128
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,806
...the violent death
of a celebrity who seemed to have it all?

129
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,327
So, what's new with you?

130
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,767
I need your help, Veronica.

131
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,441
I don't really do that anymore.

132
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,251
Look, can you just hear me out?

133
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,085
He's being bombarded by lawyers
wanting to represent him.

134
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,891
I'm just gonna go out there, see my dad...

135
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,963
...and help Logan weed out the shysters.

136
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,726
Well, give Logan my best.

137
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,680
Tell him I've gotten used to the loose bone
fragments floating around my orbital socket.

138
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,923
You may not want to mention
that violent streak to his new lawyer.

139
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,447
- Shut up, okay?
- Okay.

140
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,411
Hey there.

141
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,891
Hi.

142
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,806
Um...

143
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,806
You weren't planning on carrying me
through the airport, were you?

144
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,964
Uh, no, I just met with JAG Corps, so...
Fun bunch of guys.

145
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,441
I, um, had heard, of course...

146
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,523
...but I couldn't fully picture it.

147
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,523
You should only wear this, like, ever.

148
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,245
Let me?

149
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,811
How did you get through security?

150
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,407
Uh, I bought a $49 ticket to Palm Springs.
Totally worth it.

151
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,248
- How was your flight?
- Good.

152
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,725
I would've been fine in coach.
But thank you.

153
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,167
There's the sun. Do you ever get tired
of all this amazing weather?

154
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,730
Yeah, and how about them Dodgers?

155
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,368
Look at us, falling right back
into our old rhythms.

156
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,641
I imagine your dad
is pretty excited to see you.

157
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,370
I'm surprising him.

158
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,447
So are you gonna ask if I did it?

159
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,291
I wouldn't be here if I thought you did.

160
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,647
Hi.

161
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,683
Mars Investigations.

162
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,282
Sorry, he's unavailable.
Can I take a message?

163
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,131
Hang in there, Mr. Millet.
I should know something in a few days.

164
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,362
Uh, yes, we will take pictures...

165
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,690
...but I'm afraid "shooting the son of a bitch"
is not a service that we currently offer.

166
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,921
All right, bye.

167
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,245
You buckled.

168
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,246
Oh, the magnetic pull of Neptune High
brought you back.

169
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,971
- Heh.
- Oh, you've got spirit, yes, you do.

170
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,127
Actually...

171
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,003
No.

172
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,881
- Logan. Of course.
- I'm just helping him find a lawyer.

173
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,087
Mm-hm.

174
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,647
Oh, Piz says to tell you hi.

175
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,848
Good man, Piz.

176
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,766
How'd he feel about you coming out here
to see Logan?

177
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,681
It's not a social call.

178
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,047
He understands that.

179
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,649
Mm-hm.

180
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,802
He does.

181
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,245
What's going on here?

182
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,721
Stop and frisk.
Some developer bought up all this...

183
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,929
...now our local police
are running off the undesirables.

184
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,525
It's the Neptune way.

185
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,081
Protecting and serving the highest bidder.

186
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,125
So this new Sheriff Lamb...

187
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,284
- ...he as big of a clown as his little brother?
- Bigger.

188
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,288
Lazy and barely competent like his brother.
More venal and corrupt.

189
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:55,569
Well, if it isn't the man, the myth,
the legendary pain-in-the-ass Keith Mars.

190
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,801
Deputy.

191
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,531
You catch any husbands lately
with their pants down?

192
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,963
You should get a slide projector
and bring it down to the station.

193
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,282
We'd love to see
your dirty-picture collection.

194
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,246
Well, you boys are so busy cleaning up
the town, how will you find the time?

195
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,884
What'd you get those two crime lords for?
Embezzlement? Human trafficking?

196
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,651
Don't know yet.
But I'm sure we'll figure something out.

197
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,324
I guess you probably let a lot of things
slide on your watch.

198
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,005
Those days are gone now.

199
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,481
You know what happens
when you mess with the bull, right?

200
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,330
You get the clichés?

201
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,325
Lyles!

202
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,808
Look what we got here!

203
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,121
Couple of taggers.

204
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,601
I'm painting my sister's bike, bitch.

205
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,410
Bitch?

206
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,206
Who you calling a bitch?

207
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,885
You want some more juice, boy?

208
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,323
You move one more inch,
I will light you up like a Christmas tree.

209
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,891
Deputy.

210
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,610
Unless you wanna be a YouTube star
by tomorrow morning, let those boys go now.

211
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,801
Or I can shove that phone
right up your ass.

212
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,207
Well, we've seen
how tough you are with boys.

213
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,523
Maybe this is the day you find out
how you do with a full-grown man.

214
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,161
Would you look at that?
Already uploaded to the Cloud.

215
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,610
Well...

216
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,923
...I think these boys
have learned a valuable lesson.

217
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,082
Guess we can shut it down for the night.

218
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,730
Let's go.

219
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,201
You realize you'll make more
in your first year...

220
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,364
- ...than I did in the best years of my life?
- So?

221
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,569
So? You're destined for greatness.

222
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,929
Something much bigger
than you would have ever found here.

223
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,081
The only greatness...

224
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,841
...inherent in these jobs
I'm interviewing for...

225
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,049
...is the fact that they'll allow me
to pay off my student loans.

226
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,009
- Candygram for Mongo.
- Mongo like candy.

227
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,328
Hey, welcome home. Welcome home.

228
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,809
Mac, Wallace.
You hardly drop by at all anymore.

229
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,200
Hi.

230
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,765
- Wallace.
- Mr. Mars.

231
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,763
How's next year's
freshman class looking?

232
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,287
Words you never wanna hear
out of your dad's mouth.

233
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,249
- His team.
- Whatever, perv.

234
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,370
I've been promoted to JV coach
for next year...

235
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,410
...so now I'm just waiting
for Coach McDonald to die.

236
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,769
Well, good luck with that.
And, Mac, you still with Sun Microsystems?

237
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,604
Actually...

238
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,161
Go ahead and tell them
what you been up to now.

239
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,561
The shame. Ooh, the shame.

240
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,768
Hooters waitress?
Ren-Faire juggler?

241
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,809
- Telemarketing.
- Hooters bar back!

242
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,809
- Clubbing baby seals.
- Heh.

243
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,601
Worse. I actually took a job
with Kane Software.

244
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,969
I know. I hate it. I do.
I wish I was clubbing baby seals...

245
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,169
...but they just pay me so well.

246
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,484
$10, 000 Pyramid.
"Things a whore says."

247
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,486
- Bud. Bud Light.
- Ooh. Thank you.

248
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,971
So when Logan said "jump"...

249
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,164
...did you actually say "how high"...

250
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,483
...or was there an understanding
that you would achieve max verticality?

251
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,804
Wow. Two beers. That's how long
it takes for you to get surly.

252
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,447
In case it slipped your mind, Piz is the one
without the baggage and the drama.

253
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,967
Mm. I will say this for him:

254
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,088
He almost never gets charged
with murder.

255
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,130
- Mm.
- Just one of the things I love about Piz.

256
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,770
No drama.

257
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,926
Says the drama magnet.

258
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,128
You know what else
says a lot about a guy?

259
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,011
- His choice of friends.
- Aw!

260
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,730
What's this? Wait a minute. No.

261
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,009
I specifically told the agency
"an eager-to-please brunette."

262
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,281
Why is that so hard?

263
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,126
- Dick.
- Ah, just kidding, Ronnie. Long time.

264
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,681
Hey, Logan, that girl
who follows you around is here!

265
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,648
You get some work done?
Your boobs look bigger.

266
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,643
So do yours. Where's Logan?

267
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,007
Inside. Come on. Freaking out.

268
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,688
Another video from the Logan Echolls-Bonnie
DeVille home collection just hit the Internet.

269
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,161
- Missionary, natch.
- Heh.

270
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,365
Must be nice, Dick.

271
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,648
Be it ever so humble.

272
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,365
God, how did they get this?

273
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,487
Is anybody else surprised that I'm the only one
in this room who does not have a sex tape?

274
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,847
- It could be anybody.
- It's us.

275
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,083
- You see us when we enter the room.
- Yeah. Worst cameraman ever.

276
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,407
Dumb question, but I have to ask:

277
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,210
Did you know you were being filmed?

278
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,046
Oh, that's right, we were shooting
some of our usual leg erotica.

279
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,051
Oh, that's gotta be our first lawyer.

280
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,686
All right, then, allow me.

281
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,330
This footage looks like it was taken from
a tripod and it's just a couple feet from the bed.

282
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,527
Come on in, sir.

283
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,122
Carrie wouldn't be the first celebrity
who thought a sex tape might help...

284
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,170
- It wasn't her.
- JC Borden, Esq.

285
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,563
The "JC" is for "Jesus Cristo,
get a load of my Rolex."

286
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,362
All right. I'm gonna be out
making the Pacific Ocean my bitch.

287
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,807
No murders or forbidden love
while I'm gone, okay?

288
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,601
And, uh, hey, stay out of the brownies
unless you wanna go on a long, strange trip.

289
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,251
A little free advice?

290
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,131
A murder suspect
should avoid proximity to narcotics.

291
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,409
Medicine, man. I got my card.

292
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,086
"Chronic depression."
You wouldn't think, huh?

293
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,846
Mm. I can feel my self-worth
coming back right now.

294
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,204
So you've met my associate, Dick.

295
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,601
Okay, facts, they're important, yes.

296
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,922
Lucky for us,
they're not the end-all, be-all.

297
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,686
This case is about so much more.

298
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,004
Son of a movie star accused
of electrocuting his pop star girlfriend?

299
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,207
It will be a circus.

300
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,563
And it will be won or lost in the court
of public opinion.

301
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,722
We've got a story to sell here.

302
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,530
Dad murders your girlfriend.

303
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,728
Mom jumps off a bridge.

304
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,690
Most kids, they're gonna fold tent.
But not you.

305
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,401
You sign up to fly jets over Afghanistan
for your country.

306
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,130
I say you're a goddamn hero.

307
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,562
Some people see that viral video
and they say:

308
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,371
"Oh, he's violent. He's unhinged."

309
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,445
I see it, and I see Jesus throwing
the money lenders out of the temple.

310
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,041
Hire me. I promise you...

311
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,443
...we will find at least one person
on that jury who sees it the same.

312
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,927
Who's in charge of your social media?

313
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,242
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.

314
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,800
I'm guessing you lawyers
have to take lots of showers.

315
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,371
Hmm.

316
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,886
My advice?

317
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,690
Go with Jackson Frederick.

318
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,003
He's smart, direct. Kind of face
I don't think you'll want to punch.

319
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,602
Well, he did an admirable job
of looking like he cared if I did it or not.

320
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,003
Although our last contestant
did say something interesting.

321
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,640
She has a stylist in Malibu
who's a miracle worker?

322
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,846
Part of clearing you will be finding
a compelling alternative theory.

323
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,767
And you fly out tomorrow?

324
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,604
9 a.m.

325
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,282
Let me buy you a drink?

326
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,091
Yeah. Sure.

327
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,486
Where you wanna go?

328
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,689
<i>With glowing hearts</i>

329
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,047
<i>We see thee rise</i>

330
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,443
Charming drink names.

331
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,003
I can't decide between the Beast
with Two Backs or the Donkey Punch.

332
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,484
Ooh. Do you think they'd let me order
a virgin Devirginator?

333
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,802
I know this place sucks,
but it's karaoke night...

334
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,843
...and there's one thing
you can count on here.

335
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,684
Sexual assault on a pinball machine?

336
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,010
- Yeah.
- Oh, it's grain alcohol and peach schnapps.

337
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:27,248
<i>We stand our guard for thee</i>

338
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,767
All right.

339
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,685
Give it up
for Art Tebbel and the Mounties!

340
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,241
Okay. Next up we have...

341
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,206
...Ruby Jetson.

342
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,886
Who is that?

343
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,401
That is Bonnie DeVille's biggest fan.

344
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,685
We found her hiding in Carrie's closet
a couple months ago.

345
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,407
<i>Holding my breath</i>

346
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,530
<i>While the moon holds me</i>

347
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,051
Boo!

348
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,249
Sit down, you crazy bitch!

349
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,044
What do you expect?
They're Canadian.

350
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,690
Hey, Terrance. Phillip.

351
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,491
Like you're the Barenaked Ladies?

352
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,165
Shh. I think they might be.

353
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,931
That's the fifth Bonnie DeVille song
she's done tonight.

354
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,287
Well, that's what she does.

355
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,608
Hey, uh, this showed up in my inbox.

356
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,364
Ten minutes after Carrie was killed.

357
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,002
"Every ending brings a new beginning.
Now we can be together."

358
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,083
My compelling alternative theory.

359
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,651
She sent you this?

360
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,882
No, it's from Bonniefan23.

361
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,610
But if I had to guess...

362
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,808
<i>Try drowning all our memories tonight</i>

363
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,522
<i>Confession won't save me now</i>

364
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,285
- I miss her too.
- Okay.

365
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,443
Why'd you bring her?

366
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,007
That girl is certifiable.

367
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,686
You know, you should show that e-mail
to your lawyer.

368
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,970
Yeah, it's a good thing you said that.
I had it earmarked for the scrapbook.

369
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,969
Thank you, Veronica.

370
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,569
Nine years of radio silence and yet I still
kind of knew, deep down, I could count on you.

371
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,802
About those nine years...

372
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,121
Ah, bygones.

373
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,008
I didn't get a chance to say before.

374
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,083
I'm really sorry about Carrie.

375
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,401
It's funny, you know?

376
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,440
We had a good first year.

377
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,404
You know, a year of being in love.

378
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,561
Then her shitty friends,
her self-loathing kind of destroyed that.

379
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,882
You think I have demons?

380
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,804
She was...

381
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,722
Last year was bad.

382
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,124
And I wasn't a boyfriend.

383
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,410
Not really.

384
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,131
You know, I was something closer
to a sponsor.

385
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,524
That's a funny thought, isn't it?
Me as a stabilizing influence.

386
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,005
- You're gonna get through this.
- Am I?

387
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,291
Oh, I guess it has been a charmed life.

388
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,207
Take care of yourself, Veronica.

389
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,249
You too.

390
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,044
As far as I can see
it's no big deal. Am I missing something?

391
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,123
You really want to ask that question?

392
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,687
We're gonna move on.
We have a Bonnie DeVille update.

393
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,081
The star's family is pissed off
because Logan Echolls...

394
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,969
...is still walking around a free man.

395
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,721
Well, the fact is, I mean, Conrad Murray
walked the streets for months.

396
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,360
So you're saying
you think Logan Echolls did it.

397
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,444
I'm saying that I wouldn't want to be
in Logan Echolls' shoes.

398
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,649
Can you name a single person
who thinks that kid is innocent?

399
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,524
I can name one.

400
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,042
So, what are you gonna do about it,
Veronica?

401
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,329
Ready to head down to the Batcave?

402
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,402
"Accessories"?

403
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,291
Was I trying to keep Dad
from looking inside?

404
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,202
Would labeling it "Pandora"
have seemed a little, what, I don't know...

405
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,441
...operatic?

406
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,006
Haven't you spent nine years
figuring out exactly who you are?

407
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,286
Hasn't your life been better
since giving this up?

408
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,851
Getting out of Neptune?

409
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,891
It was an iniquitous hellhole
when you left.

410
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,771
And from the look of things,
it's only gotten more corrupt.

411
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,244
Everything you worked for
is right in front of you.

412
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,771
Solid relationship...

413
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,524
...quality job prospects...

414
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,206
...a low-profile existence.

415
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,683
Or does all that just bore
the shit out of you, Veronica?

416
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,365
It's just a couple more days.

417
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,926
He needs my help.

418
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,408
You said you were gonna be swamped
with work anyway.

419
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,163
The trade deadline approaching,
this affects the league in...

420
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,770
Sticking around for a while?

421
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,528
You know,
the magnetic pull of Neptune High...

422
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,207
I'm heading out.

423
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,930
Yep.

424
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,521
You know what? It's a one-time deal.

425
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,763
A farewell tour, if you will.

426
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,643
Then again, you ever hear the one...

427
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,885
...about the junkie who was satisfied
with just one more taste of the good stuff?

428
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,929
You should only wear this.

429
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,403
Neither have I.

430
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,680
That one.

431
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,769
Really? Not what I was expecting.

432
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,809
Not the big house.

433
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,691
It's Unit B according to
county tax records.

434
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,287
My guess is,
it's the garage apartment out back.

435
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,451
I wanna get inside.

436
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,608
Specifically, I wanna get on her computer.

437
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,206
See if, A, she's the one
who sent you that e-mail...

438
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,722
...and, B, if she had anything to do
with those videos from inside Carrie's house.

439
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,042
I think we would have
noticed her filming us.

440
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,208
You found her hiding in Carrie's closet?

441
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,408
She could have hidden a camera anywhere.

442
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,484
A stuffed animal nanny cam,
flowers always work.

443
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,847
My dad has a trucker hat
that's rigged with a camera.

444
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,530
Flowers.

445
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,727
That's how she got in.

446
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,243
We were having a party.
She came over delivering flowers.

447
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,570
We lost track of her in the chaos.

448
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,964
You think there might have been a key lying
around when you found Ruby in the closet?

449
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,805
She used it to break in
and electrocute Carrie?

450
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,440
No, it's a walled and gated subdivision
on the marina.

451
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,367
Lots of celebrity homeowners.
Former Mossad agents patrolling the grounds.

452
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,849
Why did you go over there that night?

453
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,563
The tabloids say you broke up with her...

454
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,326
...when you found out she was hooking up
with that bozo, Sean.

455
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,484
Dick saw a tweet that night saying
Carrie was showing up at the 09er.

456
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,646
She'd been 10 weeks sober, so I texted her
saying, "You sure that's a good idea?"

457
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,689
She calls me back, starts railing on me.

458
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,447
Later, she texts saying she's having
a moment of weakness and needed my help.

459
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,843
So like any good sponsor, you go?

460
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,008
Am I doing this now?

461
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,687
Fine.

462
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,560
I checked in at the gate.

463
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,969
I'd been there enough they knew me.
They just let me in.

464
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,403
I'd been to Carrie's house a hundred times.

465
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,450
I knew her alarm code.

466
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,251
Everyone knew her code,
but this time it didn't work.

467
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,930
Carrie?

468
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,003
Now, the alarm goes off.

469
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,366
Then the phone starts ringing.

470
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,165
I knew it was the guard gate...

471
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,367
Carrie!

472
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,761
...but I didn't know the code word.

473
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,887
She's not in her bedroom.

474
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,051
Then I see her bathroom door's open.

475
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,881
I walk in and there she is in the tub.

476
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,885
I reach for her.

477
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,811
Next thing I know I'm being read my rights.

478
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,722
- You didn't see the extension cord?
- No.

479
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,722
All right. We should get moving.

480
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,281
Your car doesn't exactly blend.

481
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:22,241
<i>Holding my breath</i>

482
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,324
What are the odds?
Bonnie's first chart-topping hit...

483
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,164
...seems to be all about drowning...

484
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,890
...and she's found dead in her bathtub.

485
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,449
I can taste all my secrets

486
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,887
What's the largest capacity
memory stick we own?

487
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,964
Aw. You wrote that on my first
Father's Day card.

488
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,840
I've got a 256 gig.

489
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,809
Can I borrow it?

490
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,645
Thing holds, like, 75,000 snapshots.

491
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,201
You must really be reconnecting
with old friends.

492
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,284
I shoot RAW, man.
It's a real memory hog.

493
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,486
Do you know
what you're doing here, honey?

494
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,324
The evidence paints a clear picture.

495
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,246
I know Logan has his qualities,
but there's a darkness to that kid.

496
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,368
I know what I'm doing.

497
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,800
Hi there.

498
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,962
- Are you Mrs. Barnes?
- I am.

499
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,804
My name is Pam Martin.

500
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,406
I am a location scout for a movie...

501
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,131
...and the script calls for
a garage apartment.

502
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,330
I was hoping you might let me take a look
at yours and shoot some pictures.

503
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,926
What's the movie?

504
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,481
It's called The Silver Fox.

505
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,928
It's Clint Eastwood,
starring and directing.

506
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,801
You know, my son-in-law
does Mr. Eastwood's taxes.

507
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,088
What a wonderful coincidence.

508
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,369
It's hardly surprising
there's no record of a Ruby Jetson...

509
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,807
...prior to her first Neptune utility bill.

510
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,729
The name sounds made-up.

511
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,241
A way to feel one degree closer
to her idol.

512
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,961
Did she arrive in Neptune
hoping to pal around with Bonnie?

513
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,406
Become Bonnie?

514
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,404
Become famous by killing Bonnie?

515
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,001
Yahtzee.

516
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,441
Production.

517
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,365
Uh, yeah. I just got a call
from my mother-in-law...

518
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,570
...and she says Clint Eastwood
wants to shoot a movie in her backyard.

519
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,087
Well, is your mother-in-law in Neptune?

520
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,130
Because our location scouts
are in Neptune today.

521
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,046
I know for a fact Clint Eastwood
isn't shooting a movie in Neptune.

522
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,885
Look, I don't know
what's going on here, but...

523
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,291
Buried treasure.

524
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,727
The good old Neptune High yearbook.

525
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,682
I suppose this would be a collector's item
for Bonnie's biggest fan.

526
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,251
"D. Pugh. Don't let the bastards
get you down. Shine your light. Carrie."

527
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,889
The future Bonnie DeVille herself.

528
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,401
So who is this "D. Pugh"?

529
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,325
No way.

530
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,244
Ruby Jetson.

531
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,923
Ha, ha. Like that's a valid excuse.

532
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,487
Man. Excuse me one sec.
Give me a minute.

533
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,730
- Don't you know I'm at work?
- Hey, buddy. I need a favor.

534
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,247
Can you get me
a student's permanent file?

535
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,210
You do realize that I'm a teacher now,
Veronica.

536
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,486
An educator.

537
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,449
This is a position of responsibility.

538
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,366
So you're saying it's gonna be super-easy.
Good. I did not want to put you out.

539
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,363
- Veronica.
- Ugh.

540
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,522
It's not even a current student.

541
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,011
That does not make it okay.

542
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,605
Name's Della Pugh.
She was a junior when we were seniors.

543
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,125
- You're the best.
- Veronica...

544
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,287
Shit.

545
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,524
Balboa County Sheriff's Department.
I.D. please, ma'am.

546
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,006
Perfect timing.

547
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,367
Can I get you to step by this window
real quick?

548
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,608
Can you just look out?
Gorgeous profile.

549
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,160
- Put your hands behind your back.
- We need to see some I.D.

550
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,443
Okay, but pensive, like you got
a big decision weighing on your mind.

551
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,045
Yes. Perfect.

552
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,964
Veronica Mars?

553
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,686
Deputy Sacks.

554
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,649
Kudos for rocking the 'stache
till it came back in style.

555
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,202
You made bail, Veronica.

556
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,691
Veronica, my, how you've grown.

557
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,406
Seems like only yesterday
you could have been tried as a minor.

558
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,641
Clifford.

559
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,044
Seeing as you spent all that time in law school,
you know breaking and entering is a felony.

560
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,885
Come on.
I learned that way before law school.

561
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,168
I knew the felonies
before I knew the state capitals.

562
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,086
You probably also know, then,
that convicted felons don't take the bar exam.

563
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,445
Sorry if I don't think
you blowing up your life is a joke.

564
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,681
Keith Mars!

565
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,083
Bailing his daughter out of jail.
This I had to see.

566
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,089
Sacks, get out your phone.

567
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,846
I think we just got
our Sheriff TwitPic of the Day.

568
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,326
Seriously?

569
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,484
- We're just leaving, sheriff.
- So, uh, what is it?

570
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,723
You look fit.
Not your typical junkie B&E.

571
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,208
- Veronica is friends with the Echolls kid.
- Of course she is.

572
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,409
- You must be very proud.
- You don't want to go down that path.

573
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,491
And what path is that?

574
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,763
The path where you say things
regarding my daughter that I don't like.

575
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,890
The thing is Veronica's actually
a really resourceful girl.

576
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,242
- Woman.
- How resourceful can she be, Sacks?

577
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,488
- You busted her.
- Veronica?

578
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,205
This is who you picked up?

579
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,641
Oh, my God. Hilarious, girlfriend.

580
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,770
I know, girlfriend. Isn't it?

581
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,963
This one is always playing pranks on me.

582
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,401
She's good.
It's like George Clooney and his friends.

583
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,211
Have you heard the one about him
crapping in his buddy's cat box?

584
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,566
- I love it.
- Right?

585
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,851
- So, what was it gonna be this time?
- I was gonna go with...

586
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,004
...the old aluminum vibrator
in your carry-on.

587
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,844
Ugh. Bitch.

588
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,845
You two are friends?

589
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,002
Fast friends. BFFs.

590
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,846
If both Miss Jetson and the court agree
not to press charges, Veronica's free to go.

591
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,229
The court is only involved if there's an intent
to commit a crime. There wasn't.

592
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,490
So the B&E is considered
an illegal trespass, a misdemeanor...

593
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:36,851
...leaving the charges entirely in the hands
of the victim, i.e., Ruby, i.e., my BFF.

594
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,768
What she said.

595
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,649
So, girlfriend, what are you up to?

596
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,167
Where I come from, they just say
"thank you."

597
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,449
No, they don't.
You went to Neptune High, Della Pugh.

598
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,045
I found you in the yearbook.

599
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,524
You know, at the end of my freshman year,
I tried out for the dance team.

600
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,121
I got cut.
And you were supposed to be the nice one.

601
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,409
So I came to you and said,
"What do I need to do to make the squad?"

602
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,648
And you know what you said to me?

603
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,565
"Dance better."

604
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,206
So why did you bail me out of this jam?

605
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,523
Because you have something that I want.

606
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,810
Everything in my life
has led to this moment.

607
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,765
Did she need to be here?

608
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,406
I'm the designated driver.
That's the deal.

609
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,848
- Evening, miss.
- Just give me a sec to adjust.

610
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,611
I forgot my panties.

611
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,570
So this is happening.

612
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:43,084
You understand how much trouble
I'd be in if she chooses to press charges.

613
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,369
I've let her draw hearts on my upper thigh
for the last 10 minutes.

614
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,369
So, yeah, I get the stakes.

615
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,042
Hey, Logan,
is that your new girlfriend?

616
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,844
- Whoa.
- Hey.

617
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,923
You gonna kill this one too,
lieutenant?

618
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,442
- Right this way, Mr. Echolls.
- Thanks.

619
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,011
Thank you.

620
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,009
I was with them, so...

621
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,484
Of course Ruby chose
the 09er for her date.

622
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,281
When you're too old to exclude
the undesirables from your lunch table...

623
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,570
...open a club, charge $22 for a
vodka tonic and put up a velvet rope.

624
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,326
Make them think this must be heaven.

625
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,851
Yo, what's up? All alone!

626
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,809
You drinking? You want a drink?

627
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,928
I'm just kidding. Heh.

628
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,809
Yo, see that guy over there?

629
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,405
That's my boy, Broyden.

630
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,524
And he was looking at you...

631
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,684
...and you made him premature
in his pants.

632
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,808
Also, because he thinks
you're really cool.

633
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,804
- He's a good guy, honestly.
- Fuck off.

634
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,406
If you've never been heli-skiing,
you never really skied.

635
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,324
I've got a place up in Whistler.

636
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,960
I'll take you up there with me.
Fly you up.

637
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,924
There we go. Come on, smile.

638
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,246
Just one little smile. Not gonna smile?
You have a boyfriend?

639
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,768
Is he here? What's he do?
I'm in hedge funds. What's this guy do?

640
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,924
He's a hit man.
He kills people for money.

641
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,128
Can I get a Diet Pepsi?

642
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,728
He's actually looking to invest.
Do you have a card?

643
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,170
I just need a break.

644
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,927
Apparently, uh, coming to a club alone
is just asking for it.

645
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,129
Oh, God, are too many boys hitting on you?
Poor thing.

646
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,731
Do you wanna tell me
why you broke into my place, huh?

647
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,802
Well, Bonniefan23,
you sent an e-mail...

648
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,284
...implying that Bonnie's death had the upside
of making Mr. Echolls here available to you.

649
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,369
Don't try and deny it.
I know it's true.

650
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,602
You were caught hiding
in Bonnie's closet.

651
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,481
And you have, what we in the trade call,
a "crazy-ass murderer wall."

652
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,931
It's a technical term.

653
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,924
Most people think I'm the one
sitting at a table with a murderer.

654
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,329
No offense, I know you loved her,
and you took such good care of her.

655
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,642
I'm just saying,
one of us has an airtight alibi...

656
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,724
...and the other was found passed out
next to Bonnie's body, so...

657
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,769
What's your airtight alibi?

658
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,806
Well, I was outside of this very club
with, like, 30 other velvet-rope rejects.

659
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,842
I need to take this.

660
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,170
I really don't think that you should trust her.
She seems kind of skeezy.

661
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,443
- This is Veronica.
- Veronica.

662
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,170
Hi, it's Gayle Buckley.

663
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,647
I'm so sorry to call so late.

664
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,885
How would you feel about coming to work
for us here at Truman-Mann?

665
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,202
I would feel pretty great
about that actually. Thank you.

666
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,966
We need you to start Monday.
Is that a problem?

667
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,283
Where's your date?

668
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,409
She got them to play a Bonnie single.

669
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,609
<i>Awake and away we go</i>

670
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,007
<i>To find it again</i>

671
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,009
Well, on the bright side...

672
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,288
...you are not on a date with a murderer.

673
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,721
I do take some comfort in that.
How do you know?

674
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,086
Bouncer confirmed it.

675
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,961
Apparently she was outside the club,
and performed Medea when the news broke.

676
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,369
So where do we go from here?

677
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,808
Back to New York, I'm afraid.

678
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:36,883
I, um... I just accepted my very first
big, grown-up lawyering job.

679
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,366
Good for you, Veronica.

680
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,404
I don't envy opposing counsel.

681
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,166
I really wanted to see this through with you.
To find Carrie's killer.

682
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,891
I can ease your mind there.

683
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,886
- Her dad did it.
- I'm listening.

684
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,249
You know that new tattoo she got?
The Japanese symbol for serendipity?

685
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,688
That's the name of her dad's firm.
The dad she fired as her manager.

686
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,242
She knew he was gonna try to kill her,
she implicated him before the fact.

687
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,851
Her dad was in London.

688
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,406
I checked.

689
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,881
Last theory:

690
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,487
Something awful from Bonnie's past
has come back to haunt her.

691
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,291
Have you guys even listened
to her new album?

692
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,245
Confessional?

693
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,168
The whole thing is about coming clean.
She's racked with guilt.

694
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,971
She went to Catholic school
until the tenth grade.

695
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,567
And she changed her name from Bishop.

696
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,285
You get what I'm saying.

697
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,486
Not a clue.

698
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,569
She boned a priest.

699
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,361
She was on the verge of telling the world,
the Catholic church silenced her.

700
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,366
What?

701
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,120
Sweet dreams.

702
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,962
I am so sorry.

703
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,083
And so grateful. Heh.

704
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,287
Don't be.

705
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,566
I was into it.

706
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,927
We're going skating next week.

707
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,886
Veronica, you flew across the country
to help me.

708
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,528
This was easy.

709
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,806
Um, we're going out
to dinner tomorrow night.

710
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,361
You should come. Me, Mac, Wallace.

711
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,767
My whole fan club?

712
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,928
No, I don't think so.

713
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,491
So you're not going
to the reunion either, then?

714
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,680
I circled that date in my calendar
10 years ago and vowed to skip it.

715
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,200
You need a ride to the airport?

716
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,727
Promised that to my dad.

717
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,807
I guess this is it.

718
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,286
We should take the long way home.

719
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,764
Do I get a chip for this?

720
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,440
Pouring the drink.

721
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,726
Swishing it.

722
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,041
Smelling it.

723
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,329
Leaving the bar without taking a sip?

724
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,689
Is this what getting clean feels like?

725
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,243
My daughter,
the big-shot New York lawyer.

726
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,363
You're gonna have your own office.

727
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,806
You have your own office.

728
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,610
You'll be respected.

729
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,728
You're respected.

730
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,287
- You're the George Bailey of Neptune.
- Ha.

731
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,525
You know the difference
between a lawyer and a prostitute?

732
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,967
A prostitute stops screwing you
when you're dead.

733
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,930
I got a million of them.

734
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,242
Tell me one private detective joke.

735
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,330
Uh...

736
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,043
- I thought so.
- No. Okay, smart guy.

737
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,009
Which one of these goes over better?

738
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,844
"Dad, I'm marrying a lawyer"...

739
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,207
...or "Dad, I'm marrying a private dick"?

740
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,249
Okay, no one says "dick" anymore.

741
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,246
But what's the difference between
a porcupine and lawyers in a Porsche?

742
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,169
On a porcupine...

743
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,448
...the pricks are on the outside.

744
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,090
And a howdy-do to you.

745
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,886
- What's up, V?
- Wow, you guys look good.

746
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,327
You've been to Mama Leone's before,
right?

747
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,802
It's laminated menus
and "I Heart Lobster" bibs.

748
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,088
Hey, I've got something to show you.

749
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,403
Look, this is from the talent show
our senior year.

750
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,483
The video yearbook advisor let me see it.

751
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,160
That one is Carrie Bishop.
I don't know who this other girl is.

752
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,931
It's Susan Knight. Carrie's best friend.

753
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,287
Also dead, strangely enough.
Boating accident...

754
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,920
...the year I left for Stanford.
Why are you showing me this?

755
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,407
You'll see.

756
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,410
Della Pugh, the girl whose file
you asked me to dig up...

757
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,727
Come again?

758
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,446
Ignore the dick.

759
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,767
Check this out.

760
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,809
Talent show the year after we graduated.

761
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,962
She does the same duet, solo.

762
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,406
Then when people boo...

763
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,449
I'm gonna burn this place down!

764
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,449
They didn't let her come back to school.

765
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,649
She had to take all her finals
as take-home tests.

766
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,404
But her alibi is solid.

767
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,610
I don't know, let's mull this over
while we're wearing lobster bibs.

768
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,842
Um, actually...

769
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,843
When Number One Daughter was young...

770
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,401
...her skills were sharp
like blade of sword.

771
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,646
Now, brain dull, like blade of plow.

772
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,968
- Heh.
- What the f...?

773
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,129
No.

774
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,284
Yes, ma'am.
We are going to the reunion.

775
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,963
No, I'm not going.
And you can't make me.

776
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,326
You have to go.

777
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,082
We've arranged for Piz to fly in.

778
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,486
It's our gift to you.

779
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,810
Surprise.

780
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,770
Pirates!

781
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,769
Ahoy!

782
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,606
We're here because...

783
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,804
Because you're a high-powered
New York City lawyer now.

784
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,962
You should rub that
in these people's faces.

785
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,521
And because Alexis Link said that, uh...

786
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,963
...if we were still single in 10 years
we'd get creative.

787
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,282
And there she is now.

788
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,960
Hey. As a high school nerd success story...

789
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:40,409
...it is a moral imperative
that I take my own victory lap.

790
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,283
Ahoy.

791
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,442
In a lesser known epic poem,
Dante's Inferno 2: Hell Freezes Over...

792
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,400
...10 years after escaping the nine circles,
Dante returns.

793
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,528
You know, for old times' sake.

794
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,524
Have a couple shots,
catch up with the gang...

795
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,290
Name?

796
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,169
...see if Lucifer's still a bitch.

797
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,926
- Veronica Mars.
- No way.

798
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:13,165
You look so different.
I barely recognize you.

799
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,608
Really? This look of disdain
isn't ringing any bells?

800
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,764
Let me try looking like
I think you're an asshole.

801
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,285
Wow.

802
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,126
You are still a total loser with no class.

803
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,721
How not shocking.

804
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,764
Class is still clearly a guiding force
in your life.

805
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,287
- I'm shocked you even came to this.
- Is that so?

806
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,885
I knew you'd be here.

807
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,930
Tell the truth, you've been sitting there
since graduation, haven't you?

808
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,842
Don't worry about her.

809
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,848
They really should have a bar
right by the entrance.

810
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,728
You can do this, champ.

811
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,242
Oh, look who it is!

812
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,408
Most Likely to Blog and Class Buzzkill.

813
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,641
Or was it Cutest Smile?

814
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,406
Best Personality.
You are just who I was looking for...

815
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,483
...Most-Likely-to-Know-Where-
I-Can-Find-the-Bar.

816
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,210
Well, look no further, pilgrim.

817
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,646
- Gross.
- No.

818
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,802
- What?
- No, no, no, I just feel bad for her.

819
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,846
- You know what I mean?
- Oh, my God, Veronica Mars.

820
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,927
- Hi, Gia.
- So many mixed emotions right now.

821
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,560
I kind of hated you,
like, a lot, but I don't anymore.

822
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,082
I'm trying to remember my progress.
Blaming you for telling the world...

823
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,325
...that my dad was a pedophile is what my
therapist calls "misplaced aggression," so...

824
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,962
Basically, we're totally cool.
Just so you know. Hi, by the way.

825
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,485
- You look great.
- Thank you.

826
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,801
Drop by my place while you're in town.
We have to hang.

827
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,208
Wait. Come to my after-party.
You have to, I mean it. And you...

828
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,731
Um...

829
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,530
You should come too, friend.

830
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,526
- Wow. That hair.
- Ha, ha. Gia, Gia. Stu's gonna get a plane.

831
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,570
Okay, I'm not screwing around.
Where's the bar in this joint?

832
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,722
I'll find us a table.

833
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,247
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

834
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,131
Oh-ho! No way. How random is this?

835
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,361
- Corny!
- Dude!

836
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,204
- How's it hanging, brah?
- Aw.

837
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,125
You know, I'm doing my deal,
taking time for what's mine.

838
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,681
I've been making these duct tape wallets.

839
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,889
- Pulling in kasheesh selling them on Etsy.
- Wow.

840
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,442
Yeah. Um, I make some out of maps,
if you're interested.

841
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,686
Um... Totally. Uh...

842
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,726
- You know what, I need to say hi to...
- Oh, go, go. Peace.

843
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,571
- Is that Weevil Navarro in slacks?
- Hey.

844
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,846
You're hugging me.

845
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,321
Please don't make me look bad
in front of my wife.

846
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,565
- Your what?
- Yeah.

847
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,530
This is my wife, Jade. Heh.

848
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,921
- Hi, I'm Veronica.
- Oh.

849
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,602
- Hi. It's so nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

850
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,411
- And, uh, this, this is, uh...
- Sorry.

851
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,562
This is Valentina.

852
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,565
- Shut up.
- She's 3.

853
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:55,209
I'm attending tea parties at doll stores.
This kid rules me.

854
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,885
Any Pirates in the house?

855
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,087
Ahoy!

856
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,685
That's what I'm talking about.

857
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,482
I hear she's the pole cardio instructor
to the stars.

858
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,041
So hot wife, cute kid.

859
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,487
This is not the Weevil that I know.

860
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,404
And, uh, I own my own shop now.

861
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,684
And I haven't been on my bike
since Valentina was born.

862
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,360
MADISON: To remember those of us
who are no longer around...

863
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,726
Well, I'll be damned.

864
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,126
...please turn your attention
to the screen...

865
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,965
...as we say goodbye to old friends.

866
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,051
Shelly.

867
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,044
Felix Toombs.

868
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,281
- Hey, Sean, how you doing, man?
- Meg Manning.

869
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:43,162
Some pretty interesting pictures
you got there. You think that's funny?

870
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,448
Rhonda Landers.

871
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,931
What happened to getting creative
with Alexis Link?

872
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,487
Carrie Bishop.

873
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,201
Murderer!

874
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,485
Susan Knight.

875
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,840
Okay, now I remember Susan Knight.

876
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,364
Oh, my God.

877
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,284
Logan!

878
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,401
"Serendipity," Carrie's new tattoo...

879
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:28,446
...was the name of the boat they were on
the night Carrie's best friend drowned.

880
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,807
And Carrie's new album, Confessional?

881
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,691
"Try drowning all our memories tonight"?

882
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,365
Something happened on that boat.

883
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,844
- Yeah? You sound like Ruby.
- Carrie couldn't keep the secret anymore.

884
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,163
She was unraveling,
and whoever killed Carrie...

885
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,243
...did it to shut her up.

886
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,289
So who else was on the boat that night?

887
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,047
- There was Carrie, Stu Cobbler, Dick.
- Dick?

888
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,249
Yeah. Dick, Gia Goodman, Luke Haldeman.
That crowd.

889
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,707
You ever talk about
what happened that night with Carrie?

890
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,926
Yeah, once.

891
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,129
She curled up in a fetal position,
didn't speak the rest of the night.

892
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,887
Biggest Success Story goes to...

893
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,371
...Patti Jackson...

894
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,009
...for starting her own line
of natural hair-care products.

895
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,607
Hey! My people.
This must be the good-time table.

896
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,843
- Hey, my brother! What's going on, man?
- What's up, man?

897
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,571
- How are you?
- So 10-year reunion.

898
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,691
I want some Kylie Minogue, some
Pussycat Dolls, maybe some solo Rob Thomas.

899
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,444
I've had a few drinks on the plane.

900
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,489
Shh. Where's Veronica?

901
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,565
The award for Coming the Longest
goes to...

902
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,364
...Veronica Mars.

903
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,323
Get that off. Get that off now!

904
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:45,442
- So, what brought you here tonight?
- I was gonna ask you the same.

905
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,642
I was kidnapped. You?

906
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:52,601
Pictures of Carrie doing lines of coke showed
up on Sean Friedrich's Instagram feed today.

907
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,364
I knew he'd be here tonight.

908
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:58,650
I explained to him that it would be best for him
if those came down and no more appeared.

909
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,928
Logan, you are suspected of murder.

910
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,730
- You have to be smart.
- Yeah.

911
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,565
Veronica.
You need to get back inside now.

912
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,771
Piz is here,
and he's wondering where you are.

913
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,407
And that is not the worst of it.

914
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,885
Neptune High.
What do you think so far?

915
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,169
It actually does sit on a Hellmouth.

916
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,131
- Piznarski, no.
- This is what men do, right?

917
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,890
- What do we do?
- Get to an exit.

918
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,770
Welcome to the V.C., bitch!

919
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,411
Veronica!

920
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,126
You must be so proud.

921
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,886
Just because you were
an unpopular bitch...

922
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,520
...you had to ruin it for everybody else.

923
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,722
- I'd stop there.
- Oh, would you?

924
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,927
What are you gonna do,
use your stun gun on me?

925
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,128
Don't you think that's gotten a bit old?

926
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,448
Original enough for you?

927
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,803
This is absurd. The school district
is on the hook for the deposit.

928
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,689
How did this happen?

929
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,407
Never mind.

930
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,447
Hey, Mr. C.
You miss me yet?

931
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,841
It's been 10 years of peace and quiet,
Veronica.

932
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,570
If you like that sort of thing.

933
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,089
Veronica.

934
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,523
It's been...

935
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:17,727
...boring.

936
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,362
Yeah, buddy.

937
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,365
Wanna hit an after-party?

938
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,364
Oh, but I'm having so much fun here.

939
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:36,168
- Yeah, I think I'll skedaddle.
- That's probably wise.

940
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,970
Hey, thanks for jumping in, Piz.

941
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,600
Oh, sure, sure.

942
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,363
Logan gonna be at this after-party?

943
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,249
Nope.

944
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,570
<i>'Cause this is a stickup</i>

945
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,929
<i>It's time to give up
I'm takin' over tonight</i>

946
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,485
<i>So put your hands in the air</i>

947
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,927
Sure, it looks like I'm having fun.

948
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,766
But even my alkie mom knew how to
put on a show to hide her disease.

949
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,328
She could PTA with the best of them,
but her mind was never far...

950
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,290
...from that bit of liquid courage
she kept handy.

951
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,444
I adore these three people,
but there's a case to be solved.

952
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,000
<i>So shut up and dance</i>

953
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,767
There are people in this room
with information I want and don't have.

954
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,401
Dick at 2 o'clock.

955
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,847
Gia and Luke at 6.

956
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,003
Cobb by the buffet.

957
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,525
And until I get it...

958
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,241
...they are the proverbial flask
in my purse.

959
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,370
I mean, all the fighting and the dancing.

960
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,967
Living in an old Michael Jackson music video,
it's exhausting.

961
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,088
Somebody needs a tasty beverage.

962
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,083
- Mm-hm.
- They're making drinks with kumquats.

963
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,449
Would you like me
to procure one for you?

964
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,011
You would do that for me?

965
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,367
I live to serve.

966
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,170
Farewell, my concubine.

967
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,290
- And I'll take a Bud. Thanks for asking.
- And an Old Grand-Dad.

968
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,171
The bourbon. Not some old guy.

969
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,525
Words With Friends?

970
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,365
Some people just call it texting.

971
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,324
I wanna ask you about the night
Susan Knight died.

972
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,204
Heh. Of course you do.
It's a party.

973
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:16,890
The memorial video got me thinking.
I've never really heard what happened.

974
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,600
I have told this story
about 10 zillion times, but okay.

975
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,009
We were partying on Carrie's dad's boat.

976
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,208
We all got hammered,
because it turns out...

977
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,330
...it's pretty boring partying
on a boat after about 15 minutes.

978
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,644
Woke up the next morning and everyone
is freaking out because they can't find Susan.

979
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,883
Ripped the boat apart looking for her...

980
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,008
...but she was gone-zo.

981
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:44,640
Last time I saw Susan, she was
blowing chunks over the side of the boat.

982
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,370
She must've slipped and fell off.

983
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,611
I heard later
that she couldn't swim for shit.

984
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,411
What a nightmare.

985
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,891
I can't imagine.

986
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,771
Must have been awful
when you figured out she was missing.

987
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,891
I had to go to therapy
for post-traumatic stress.

988
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,725
I still can't go on a boat.

989
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,650
Or smell schnapps.

990
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,644
It was awful. It was, uh...
We drank a shit-ton of booze...

991
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:11,722
...and we all woke up, we were really
hungover, panicked out of our minds.

992
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,724
It was a crazy night.

993
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,089
Ooh, what crazy night are we talking about?

994
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:20,801
Veronica was just asking
about the night that Susan fell overboard.

995
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,681
I hired a mixologist, Veronica.
Now is not the time.

996
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,888
And no mention? I mean...

997
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,530
You guys are getting married?

998
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,047
In three months and two days.
Son of a congressman.

999
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,402
He's his dad's chief of staff now...

1000
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,324
...but he's got his eye on the prize.

1001
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,720
Sorry to interrupt. Uh...

1002
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,043
You're running low on ice.
I'll run over to my place and get some.

1003
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,090
Can you bring back wine
and aspirin too, please?

1004
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,526
Yeah.

1005
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,809
Hey, I'm really sorry about Carrie, Gia.
I know you all were friends.

1006
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,450
Not just friends. She was gonna be
one of my bridesmaids.

1007
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,161
Yeah, Gia was the last person
to see her other than, uh...

1008
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,886
...you know. Ahem.

1009
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,964
If she had just been on time for once,
she'd still be alive.

1010
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,409
- Ha, ha.
- And you thought I wasn't listening.

1011
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,642
See?
I told you she didn't join a cult.

1012
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,885
Get back in your car.

1013
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,363
You're gonna get hurt, old man.

1014
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,927
I'm lost. Don't you get that?

1015
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,401
The navigation led me out here.

1016
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,723
They're gonna murder me, or worse!

1017
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,311
- Hey, do you want some help?
- Aah!

1018
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,686
- Hello?
- Your cab has arrived.

1019
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,962
Your cab has arrived.

1020
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,122
- Veronica?
- Yeah?

1021
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,400
Cab's here.
I thought I was taking you to the airport.

1022
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,647
Cab's for me.

1023
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,009
Veronica's sticking around town
a little bit longer. Good to see you.

1024
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,605
- Stosh?
- Hey.

1025
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,206
I'm onto something, Dad. It's big.

1026
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,846
And you were in there?
All night?

1027
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:38,127
Did Veronica not show you our fine selection
of couches? That baby folds out.

1028
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,446
The walls here are thin.

1029
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:43,082
But our tantric lovemaking is remarkable
for its stillness and tranquility.

1030
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:46,323
She passed out. Nothing happened.

1031
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,886
I'm gonna go get my cab.

1032
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,121
The new job just gave me
a couple more days...

1033
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,329
...so I will be back by the time
your parents get to the city.

1034
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,091
Okay, fair warning...

1035
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,446
...I've oversold you.

1036
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,883
They don't think I could have landed a creature
such as the one I've described.

1037
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,088
Don't they know their son's
a sexual sharknado?

1038
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:14,041
Ha, ha. Uh, hasn't come up yet.
I've been waiting for the perfect moment, so...

1039
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,642
- Bye.
- Bye.

1040
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,962
Cliff just called from the hospital.
Celeste Kane shot Weevil Navarro.

1041
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,884
She's claiming self-defense.

1042
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:37,761
- Weevil just regained consciousness.
- I'm coming with you.

1043
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,760
Celeste Kane's statement says
her car broke down...

1044
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,809
...and she was accosted
by the motorcycle gang.

1045
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,849
She claims she was terrified.

1046
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,446
Then she says Mr. Navarro
approached her car...

1047
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,484
...rapped on the window with a Beretta
and said, "Time to party."

1048
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,721
That's when she fired.

1049
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,564
Please get this case dismissed...

1050
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,724
...before anybody believes the words
"time to party" came out of my mouth.

1051
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:01,123
- Did you have a gun out, Eli?
- I haven't touched a gun in years.

1052
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,408
Oh, police gave me this.

1053
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:06,530
It's a gun reported stolen
from a house in Weevil's neighborhood.

1054
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,923
That the police clearly confiscated
and planted on him.

1055
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:12,202
Weevil's record
has been spotless for five years.

1056
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:15,284
Meanwhile, this is my 11th client
in the past six months...

1057
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,649
...claiming that the sheriff's department
planted contraband on them.

1058
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,608
You have a serial number on that gun?

1059
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,806
So if we're to believe
this police report...

1060
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,363
...Weevil left the reunion, dropped off
his foxy wife and his "Most Changed" trophy...

1061
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,642
...and, still wearing his dress
shirt and slacks...

1062
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,485
...teamed up with the motorcycle gang
he left a decade ago...

1063
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,042
...to harass the richest divorcée
in Southern California?

1064
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:41,283
Well, when you say it like that,
I start to see some holes in it.

1065
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,762
I'm gonna talk to some of those gang kids.
See if any will come forward.

1066
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,207
See if there's a Beretta
registered to Celeste Kane.

1067
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,124
Veronica.

1068
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,203
I have this. It's my case.

1069
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,966
You already have a job. It's in New York.

1070
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,645
You did it, kid. You made it out.

1071
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:59,168
Don't let this town take you down
like it does everyone else.

1072
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,321
Didn't take you down.

1073
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,448
Well, love is blind.

1074
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,489
Dr. Newton to Physical Therapy.

1075
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,170
Dr. Newton to Physical Therapy.

1076
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:10,164
I could still get you the names
of the PCHers.

1077
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,084
I have someone
in the sheriff's department...

1078
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,368
...who might help me
if he can work up the nerve.

1079
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,847
The nerve?
The sheriff's department is a joke.

1080
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,401
It's been a giant clown car
since you left office.

1081
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,604
They're dangerous, Veronica.

1082
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,321
Cops with swimming pools and sports cars?
They've got a good thing going.

1083
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:29,007
- I want you to stay away from them.
- Yeah, okay.

1084
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,288
- Just... I need one file from them.
- Veronica.

1085
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,331
And don't worry, I won't even go to get it.
I'll have it delivered.

1086
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,006
Dr. Loan, Dr. Harriet Loan.

1087
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,961
Hey, Sacks, do you think I need to set
a Google alert for "Sheriff Daniel Lamb?"

1088
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,522
I'm afraid I might be missing stuff
by just having "Sheriff Dan Lamb."

1089
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,851
- Why am I even asking you?
- You have a call on Line 1.

1090
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,521
Martina Vasquez?

1091
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,682
- Channel 9's Martina Vasquez?
- Yeah. She's got some questions for you.

1092
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,771
This is Sheriff Dan Lamb.

1093
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:14,649
Got a minute, sheriff?

1094
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:18,361
Ha, ha. Nothing but time for you,
Miss Martina Vasquez.

1095
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,567
What can I do for you?

1096
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:23,850
You have something
I'm dying to get my hands on, sheriff.

1097
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,651
Well, vice versa, Miss Vasquez.

1098
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:29,446
I'm doing a lengthy piece
on Bonnie DeVille.

1099
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,962
I'd love whatever you have on the night
her best friend drowned.

1100
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,122
I understand there was an investigation?

1101
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,444
Yeah. We're not really in the habit
of just handing out case files.

1102
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:43,605
I'm not in the habit of dating cops,
but I make exceptions.

1103
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,922
Do you ever make exceptions?

1104
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,243
I'll have it scanned for you right now.

1105
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,405
Would you say I was a good parent?

1106
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,325
Great. Do you have a pen?

1107
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,561
Uh...

1108
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,488
indeed, I do.

1109
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,567
Detective, there is a woman at your desk.

1110
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,401
I told her not to wait there,
but she's not taking no for an answer.

1111
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,721
Huh.

1112
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,771
Excuse me, miss, can I help you?

1113
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,924
Long time, deputy.

1114
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,208
I'm sorry, do we know each other?

1115
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,042
Leo, stop.

1116
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,964
It's Veronica. We used to make out.

1117
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,085
Which was a little sketchy...

1118
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:38,483
...because you worked at the sheriff's
department and I was still in high school.

1119
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,085
No, Veronica.

1120
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,242
From Neptune.

1121
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,005
What can I do for you?

1122
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,170
Um...

1123
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,004
The Susan Knight drowning
about nine years ago.

1124
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,811
I was just hoping to ask you
a few things about it...

1125
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:56,123
...because you questioned Carrie Bishop.
Do you remember?

1126
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:59,325
Heh. I'm really sorry.
How do we know each other again?

1127
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,045
- It was...?
- Veronica.

1128
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,645
Veronica. I don't mean to be rude...

1129
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:06,109
...but the first time you came around
asking me for favors, you got all dolled up.

1130
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,485
And you brought me a pizza.

1131
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,691
- You're a prick.
- I'm a prick?

1132
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,888
Mm-hm. You're a prick.

1133
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:16,328
I'm a prick, but also I love pizza,
and I thought, "What a gesture."

1134
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,801
You had that red number on,
I liked the red number.

1135
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,843
It made me think impure thoughts.

1136
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:24,010
And I feel like this
is a step backwards for us.

1137
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,645
There it is. By the way...

1138
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:29,207
...I didn't know the FBI
was looking into the DeVille case.

1139
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,408
- I'm not with the FBI.
- Are you sure?

1140
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:34,325
I could've sworn that I heard somewhere
that you were with the FBI.

1141
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,121
- Another life, maybe.
- All right, let me see it.

1142
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,123
Not the pizza.
I'm gonna get into the pizza in a minute.

1143
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,107
This is the whole Susan Knight case file.
How'd you get this?

1144
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,722
Yeah, when I took Carrie's statement
that night, she was a complete wreck.

1145
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,962
She was talking about
how it was their fault.

1146
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,881
How they were going to hell, how they were
supposed to take care of each other.

1147
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,164
And I tried to get more specifics...

1148
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:03,085
...but Luke Haldeman Senior's
lawyer showed up...

1149
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,502
...and demanded that he speak
to all of them in private.

1150
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:09,288
That's when they all, I don't know,
decided to toe the company line.

1151
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:13,009
They were all drinking, they passed out.
They woke up, Susan was gone.

1152
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,845
Yeah, no body was ever found.
Never sat right with me.

1153
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,129
But we never had any evidence
to the contrary, so...

1154
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,646
Someone on the Serendipity killed Carrie.

1155
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,882
- I would bet my life on it.
- Okay.

1156
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,326
Gia Goodman.

1157
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,891
Luke Haldeman.

1158
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,087
Stu Cobbler.

1159
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,921
Your longtime companion, Dick.

1160
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,884
Hey, Iron Mike.

1161
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:42,880
Have you seen the Instagram feed from the
reunion? Some hilarious shots from the fight.

1162
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,491
Check out your boy, Piz.

1163
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,929
Kapow!

1164
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,330
Ha, ha!
There's another one back here too.

1165
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,649
Hey, you didn't tell me you and Piz
were a thing.

1166
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,961
My love life didn't seem relevant.

1167
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,287
Wait, what was that?

1168
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,249
Toya LaGrone's hoobity-boobities.

1169
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,364
- No, back one.
- Okay.

1170
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,565
- What?
- What, did you see a ghost or something?

1171
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,042
This is a police photo of the boat...

1172
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,050
...the morning after Susan Knight
disappeared off of it.

1173
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,361
Notice anything?

1174
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:28,605
- Uh, the police photo is black-and-white.
- The anchor.

1175
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,890
- Exactly.
- I don't see an anchor.

1176
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,371
Not in this one.

1177
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,522
Here is where it normally goes.

1178
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,926
Okay, so?

1179
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:42,210
So my first guess is that there is no anchor,
because it was used to make sure...

1180
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:45,250
...that Susan Knight's body sunk
to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.

1181
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,604
California has the death penalty, Dick.

1182
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:52,387
So act like you give a damn about your friend
and tell me what really happened that night.

1183
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,323
I already told you, Veronica, okay?

1184
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,708
I don't think this has jack to do
with Carrie's murder.

1185
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,681
I wish Logan could quit you.
I'm your friend. Are you listening to this?

1186
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:05,083
- I need your computer.
- Yeah, well, at least you asked nicely.

1187
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,003
Hey, you got any more of
those cupcakes?

1188
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,207
You're still here?

1189
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:18,645
Why? Is your boyfriend
showing up? Heh.

1190
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,050
She's sitting at her makeup table.

1191
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,124
That angle, that's exactly where
she kept her tablet docked.

1192
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:27,170
So the feed could be coming
from the tablet camera.

1193
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:30,608
People can do that? They can spy on you
from your own tablet?

1194
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,764
I don't know,
but I know someone who would.

1195
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:38,448
Nobody could be spying on you from
your normal out-of-the-box tablet computer.

1196
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,284
But it is possible.

1197
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:45,480
Someone would have to modify
a wireless model, install additional hardware.

1198
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:46,846
It would be complicated.

1199
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:50,806
There were Galaxy tablets
in the gift bags at the MTV Music Awards.

1200
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,766
Carrie was making fun of James Franco
for trying to walk off with six.

1201
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,487
Franco. You guys see that Candid Camera
video of him trying on skinny jeans?

1202
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,130
Shit is hilarious.

1203
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:02,927
Show me.

1204
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,691
Well, I believe I have that bookmarked
right here.

1205
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,126
Sayonara, Mac.

1206
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,840
Let's get weird!

1207
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:23,007
There may be six degrees between
anyone on the planet and Kevin Bacon...

1208
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,680
...but if you're under 30
and living in Southern California...

1209
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,889
...you're never more than two degrees
from James Franco.

1210
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,242
In this case, Dick to facialist...

1211
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,368
...facialist to Franco's assistant.

1212
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,000
Then something to get
that assistant's attention.

1213
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:40,851
All right, let me see
if I'm understanding this correctly.

1214
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,163
You do not have in your possession
pages from Tolkien's original manuscript...

1215
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:47,688
...for the Quenta Silmarillion
depicting Beren wandering into Doriath...

1216
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:50,684
...and falling in love with Luthien,
the Elf king's daughter?

1217
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,285
- I do not.
- What?

1218
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,448
- You didn't check this out, Penny?
- Yes...

1219
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,649
You recently attended
the MTV Movie Awards...

1220
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:01,327
...and I'm fairly certain that whoever
gave out the gift bags at the awards...

1221
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:04,324
...gave tablets that were preloaded
with spy software.

1222
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:07,131
- Really?
- You might have noticed some strange videos...

1223
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,884
...of you circulating the Internet.

1224
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,521
- How strange? Like, naked strange?
- No.

1225
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,145
One of you trying on skinny jeans...

1226
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,248
...and one of you in your underwear
trying to list words...

1227
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,688
- ...that rhyme with orange.
- Yeah. It's so hard.

1228
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,327
Borange. Corange. Dorange.

1229
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:23,800
Well, that's not that bad.

1230
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,247
Penny floats in and out of frame
in a few of the videos...

1231
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,882
...so I was hoping we could use her
to smoke out who's ever doing this.

1232
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:33,726
Or I could just play her in drag.
Hey, Penny, give me your glasses.

1233
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:39,050
Hey. So you're interested
in hidden-camera celebrity footage.

1234
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:43,888
If you've got the cash, I've got some
hidden video I know you'll want to see.

1235
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:48,841
Meet me at the Santa Monica Pier
in one hour by the dancing gorilla.

1236
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:52,527
Good job, Pen.

1237
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,249
Monkey's following you. Ha, ha!

1238
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,005
Of course.

1239
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,605
Do you work for tips?

1240
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,643
Here's a tip. Change professions.

1241
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:13,044
Vincent Van Lowe.
Neptune's second-best PI but foremost ass-hat.

1242
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,009
- Monkeys.
- Psst.

1243
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:18,682
Anyone looking for some quality
celebrity video?

1244
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,604
Yeah, but it better be weird.

1245
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:25,084
I don't want any more night vision footage
of James Franco adjusting his nuts.

1246
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,170
We'll go back to my van.
Show me what you got.

1247
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:32,485
Let's Go Back to My Van:
The Vinnie Van Lowe Story.

1248
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:36,087
Think, Vinnie,
10,000 tequila sunrises ago.

1249
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,480
Oh.

1250
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:40,610
Well, if it isn't Neptune's
very own Angela Lansbury.

1251
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,322
You've aged well.

1252
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,804
I hear you went legit.

1253
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,009
As it turns out, I am too legit to quit.

1254
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,288
I need everything
you got off Bonnie DeVille's tablet.

1255
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,125
Oh. I know not of what you speak.

1256
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:58,524
I am just a respectable businessman
trying to earn an honest dollar.

1257
01:10:58,680 --> 01:10:59,727
Give it to me, Vinnie.

1258
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,770
Or I'll tell 50 Cent's security team
where they can find the guy...

1259
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:05,161
...who posted video of Fiddy
baking lemon cake...

1260
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,727
...while singing "Afternoon Delight."

1261
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,243
I can feel you acting
like you're not impressed.

1262
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,609
You should be happy for me, V-Mars.
I found my calling.

1263
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:23,005
Oh, yeah. Nip slips. Boozy bar exits.
Bad beach bodies.

1264
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:26,130
Do you have any idea
what <i>People</i> will pay...

1265
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:29,921
...for a shot of a celebrity looking stupid
while eating? A lot.

1266
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,161
I do the circuit.

1267
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,085
I do the chi-chi stores
and I do the French preschools.

1268
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:36,208
If you have more than five IMDb credits...

1269
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:40,207
...you can't pick a wedgie in your backyard
without me finding out a way to get paid.

1270
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:43,769
Ha, ha. I'm the reason people know
Anne Hathaway has a vagina.

1271
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,810
Before that, they thought, yeah, maybe,
but they didn't know.

1272
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:50,003
Two hundred and fifty-six gigs. Nice.

1273
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,882
Anyway, you'll like this.
I stuffed 30 tablets into those MTV gift bags.

1274
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,964
- You wanna know my return on investment?
- Nope. No, I don't.

1275
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,366
You're legal now, right?

1276
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,851
We should go out sometime.

1277
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,451
- Yuck.
- All right.

1278
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,329
Your loss. Hey, FYI...

1279
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,643
...uh, Bonnie DeVille?
Her video feed ends the night she dies.

1280
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,161
It's motion-detected...

1281
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,290
...so, you know, there's not a lot
of motion postmortem.

1282
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,680
Good seeing you, Veronica.

1283
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,171
This isn't gonna be easy to watch.

1284
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:22,890
It's all the video Vinnie captured
off the tablet camera.

1285
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:26,687
- Hey.
- You're such a punk-ass bitch.

1286
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:28,321
You want this...

1287
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,845
...in your face?

1288
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,446
- No, I really don't.
- Eat up.

1289
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,328
Speak, girl. Speak.
You can do it. Speak.

1290
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:45,324
And this is the day she died.

1291
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,928
Hey, it's Carrie.
We're going out tonight.

1292
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,242
Gia said she was at
Carrie's house that day.

1293
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,281
What is that?

1294
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,283
Where are we now?

1295
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,323
Recognize this?

1296
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,245
She's at the 09er.

1297
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,851
And check out the timestamp.

1298
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,570
12:32.

1299
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:11,087
That's when I got the text from Carrie
saying she needed my help.

1300
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,760
Carrie didn't send you
that text. Gia did.

1301
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,161
Right here.
From Carrie's tablet.

1302
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,164
It was Gia trying to get you to show up
at Carrie's house.

1303
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,128
I know what happened.

1304
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,524
Nice hat. Irony.

1305
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,486
- How's that working out for you?
- No irony here.

1306
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,688
Free hug. Anytime, anywhere.

1307
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:39,367
Pass. Sacks said you had something
I'd be interested in.

1308
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,767
I'm assuming it's a signed confession.

1309
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,843
How was Carrie's time of death
determined?

1310
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,289
Quickly. Guards at the security gate
checked Logan in at 1:15 a.m.

1311
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,649
Carrie's alarm went off at 1:21.

1312
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,928
They showed up.
Found her dead at 1:31.

1313
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:56,243
Time of death
sometime between 1:21 and 1:31.

1314
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,050
Carrie was dead long before that.

1315
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:01,767
- Gia Goodman was over there earlier.
- Guards checked her out at 3 p.m.

1316
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:05,606
Many people, including Free Hugs
over here, spoke to Carrie after that.

1317
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:06,841
We have phone records.

1318
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,884
Carrie was alive when Gia left,
but Gia didn't go alone.

1319
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:17,320
Her son-of-a-congressman fiancé
went with her.

1320
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,967
Probably in the trunk.

1321
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:26,241
When Gia left, she simply left a door
or a window open for Luke.

1322
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,406
He waited for his opportunity.

1323
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:35,769
After he did the deed,
he grabbed Carrie's tablet...

1324
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,924
...and he changed the alarm code
all Carrie's friends knew.

1325
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:42,767
He shows up at the 09er,
establishing a very public alibi.

1326
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:47,487
Carrie's friends knew Logan and Carrie
were always fighting about her partying.

1327
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,530
Gia sent a text she knew
would get Logan to show up.

1328
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,121
I suppose they murdered her for kicks.

1329
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,965
I know how painfully boring
these rich kids' lives are.

1330
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,930
They murdered Carrie because
they were convinced she was cracking.

1331
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:02,527
Something terrible happened
on Carrie's dad's boat nine years ago.

1332
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:05,291
Something worth killing Carrie
to keep secret.

1333
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,642
Look at these photos.

1334
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,725
This one was taken the morning
after Susan Knight disappeared.

1335
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:16,000
No anchor.
They used it to weigh the body down.

1336
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,448
Where'd you get
these official police photos?

1337
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,882
Maybe she's friends
with Martina Vasquez?

1338
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:28,364
I'm gonna enjoy seeing that smirk disappear
when that foreman hands down a life sentence.

1339
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,405
Hey.

1340
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:33,209
You wanna know a secret?

1341
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,691
I don't give a shit.

1342
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:38,211
I don't care if Logan ain't the guy.

1343
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,409
America thinks he's guilty,
and that's good enough for me.

1344
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:44,408
Now get the hell out of my office.

1345
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:48,685
Hey.

1346
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:02,445
I, uh... I believe the captain told you
that the use of cell phones was prohibited.

1347
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,444
Heh. I'm not on the plane.

1348
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,285
- Yeah, I gathered.
- I really wanna be there with you.

1349
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:11,569
There's just so much
going on here right now.

1350
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:13,643
I just... I couldn't leave.

1351
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:15,527
Sure you could.

1352
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,610
Okay.

1353
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:22,926
Could you maybe try and understand
why I chose not to?

1354
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:24,320
I completely understand.

1355
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,004
That's why I think
it's time for us to just...

1356
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,640
Just walk away.

1357
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,082
Wait, no, that's not what this is.

1358
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:33,571
I mean, that's not what I want.

1359
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:36,929
Veronica, I'm standing outside of a hotel
with my parents...

1360
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,401
...who flew to New York mostly to meet you.

1361
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,847
So that loyalty, or friendship...

1362
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,480
...or whatever it is that made you
have to stay in Neptune...

1363
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,166
...I wish that same feeling
made you get on the plane today.

1364
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,203
I gotta go let my mom off the hook, okay?

1365
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,250
She's concerned that her blowout's
gonna flatten before you get here.

1366
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:57,285
Piz, I'm...

1367
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,408
- I'm really sor...
- Yeah. Okay.

1368
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:02,042
Okay. Goodbye, Veronica.

1369
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:16,722
Logan's coming over
to talk about the case.

1370
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,882
Please be nice.

1371
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,564
What? I'm over 21.

1372
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,082
Truman-Mann left a message.

1373
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:30,080
Apparently, they left several on your cell
but never heard back.

1374
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,524
Okay. I'll give them a call. Thanks.

1375
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:35,160
No need.
They said they're moving on without you.

1376
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:40,405
They needed someone a little more
"motivated," I think it was. Or "dedicated."

1377
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,164
I saved the message.

1378
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:45,682
The gist was they wanted someone
who cared enough to return a call.

1379
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:51,447
You worked so hard for so long...

1380
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:55,886
...and just like that...

1381
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,651
...you're throwing it away?

1382
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,689
For what?

1383
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:05,726
This is Keith.

1384
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,649
Just give me two minutes. Okay?

1385
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,325
All right. Bye.

1386
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,724
I'm gonna...
I'll be right back.

1387
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,564
Deputy.

1388
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,770
I guess I picked the wrong week
to quit smoking.

1389
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:43,566
You know, I saw this thing on, uh, YouTube
a few weeks ago, Keith. It's a funny video.

1390
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:48,682
Two Nazi officers, they're looking
at the skulls on their insignias.

1391
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:50,571
The piles of dead bodies.

1392
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,801
And they have this moment of clarity.

1393
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,724
"Wait a minute.

1394
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:57,566
We're the bad guys."

1395
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:04,687
If you were a bad guy, Jerry,
you wouldn't be here now.

1396
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,530
Lamb, he's just a puppet.

1397
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:08,006
Everyone is on the take.

1398
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,891
That gun they planted on the Navarro kid...

1399
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,281
...I checked that into evidence myself.

1400
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:17,288
And that's just the tip of iceberg.

1401
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:21,011
And you'll testify to that fact?

1402
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:29,407
We gotta move.

1403
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,247
Mr. Mars.

1404
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,367
Yeah, I need an ambulance.

1405
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,521
Oh, my God.

1406
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,127
No.

1407
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:08,930
Mr. Mars, come on.

1408
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,446
Come on, come on.

1409
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,642
Dad! Dad!

1410
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,569
- What happened?
- Is he hurt?

1411
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,484
No. Open your eyes!

1412
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:23,651
Open your eyes, Dad. Wake up.
It's Veronica.

1413
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,290
Call for an ambulance, now!

1414
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,406
Miss Mars.

1415
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,603
Your father has some
pretty serious injuries.

1416
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,967
He has fractures of the ribs,
skull and pelvis.

1417
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:46,122
We're gonna have to keep him in the ICU.

1418
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:50,330
- When can I see him?
- It'll probably be a couple of days.

1419
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,484
And Sacks?

1420
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,768
The other man in the car?

1421
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:57,571
I'm afraid he was DOA.

1422
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,722
Was he a friend of yours?

1423
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,087
Wait.

1424
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:06,129
Don't go.

1425
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,410
Okay.

1426
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:06,287
The only way I'm not gonna spend the day
obsessing about my dad...

1427
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:09,489
...is by nailing Gia and Luke to the wall.

1428
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,290
Let's go make them sweat.

1429
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:13,566
- Gia Goodman?
- Oh.

1430
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:16,291
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1431
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:26,286
- ...the 21st...
- ...back tonight...

1432
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,283
Thanks, Grandma.

1433
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,968
Hi, this is Gia.

1434
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,250
Hey, it's Carrie.

1435
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,448
You're such a punk-ass bitch.

1436
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,607
Speak, girl. Speak.

1437
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:58,441
Hey. Something's happening.
You need to get over here right away.

1438
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:06,042
- Hey.
- I've made the call to Gia.

1439
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,806
She immediately freaked out
and called her partner in crime.

1440
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,043
- Have you seen Luke pick up?
- I can't actually see Luke right now.

1441
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:15,443
Apparently, he had to make a pit stop
for some hot man-on-man action.

1442
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,886
What are you talking about?

1443
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:19,082
Luke is inside
a West Hollywood bathhouse.

1444
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,362
What's he doing at...? Oh.

1445
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:25,448
Hold on. Someone's at her door.

1446
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:32,490
So I just got this call
from this random number and...

1447
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:33,967
It's Cobb.

1448
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:37,010
- It was Carrie's voice and she seemed...
- She called Cobb for help.

1449
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:39,322
Why? Does she need someone
to empty her cat box?

1450
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:42,484
- Shh, shh.
- Someone is just messing with you.

1451
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:45,160
I mean, it's probably that nosy bitch,
Veronica Mars.

1452
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:48,164
Tsk. It's called "curiosity."

1453
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,651
You need to relax, Gia.
Just relax.

1454
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,565
No freaking way.

1455
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:05,006
Update, please.

1456
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:09,090
Yeah, Gia and Cobb
are totally about to do it.

1457
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:10,321
Are you serious?

1458
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:13,290
Gia seduced her lapdog into killing Carrie.

1459
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:16,171
- Can you see them?
- No, thank God.

1460
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:18,681
Ugh.

1461
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,770
- Shit.
- What's going on?

1462
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,685
Dad had all the good
listening devices locked up.

1463
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,684
I had to use one of the old bugs
that uses FM signals.

1464
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,810
Bandwidth at the end of the dial
no one uses, 88.6.

1465
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,726
As in "88.6 Rock Hard Rock?"

1466
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:35,566
Tell me you're joking.

1467
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:39,361
- Neptune's new classic rock station.
- All right. Probably okay.

1468
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:43,844
The bug only transmits a hundred yards or so.
I should be able to get away with it.

1469
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:51,088
Was Carrie's tablet one of the big ones
or the little ones?

1470
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:52,924
No, it was a little white one.

1471
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:56,567
There is one matching that description
on Gia's table.

1472
01:25:56,720 --> 01:26:00,202
- She'd have to be stupid to keep it there.
- I sat behind her in Algebra.

1473
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,725
Nothing would shock me.

1474
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,002
Well, Carrie's was inscribed. It was like:

1475
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:07,209
"Rock you very much from
the MTV Music Awards," something like that.

1476
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:11,126
- Tsk. I need to get a closer look.
- Veronica.

1477
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:15,490
I'm not gonna break in.
I'm just gonna drop by for a hang.

1478
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:16,766
She could be a murderer.

1479
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:19,651
Child, please. It's Gia Goodman.

1480
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,326
The day I can't handle Gia Goodman...

1481
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,446
The four minutes of sex
I could hear just fine.

1482
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,444
The mike couldn't pick up
the last 20 minutes of pillow talk...

1483
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,001
...or whatever has gone on
in that bedroom.

1484
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:46,889
Hi, kitty.

1485
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:57,242
Veronica. Hi.

1486
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,650
That look is making me think you didn't mean it
when you said "come by and hang." Heh.

1487
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:04,845
No, I meant it. Come on in. Come in.

1488
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:09,325
Oh, wow.

1489
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:10,925
Do you like your little tablet?

1490
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,561
I mean, I have the big one.

1491
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:17,722
But this is so cute, isn't it?

1492
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,962
Well, cute only gets you so far in life.

1493
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:21,770
Am I right?

1494
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:30,083
All right!

1495
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:31,730
I'm sorry. What?

1496
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:34,281
My regularly scheduled programming
was preempted...

1497
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:36,920
...by the sound of you
getting your rocks off, hoss.

1498
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:39,481
You really wanted that poor girl
to say your name.

1499
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:42,488
What are you talking about?

1500
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:48,170
- ...shot clock...
- ... manager's a crazy...

1501
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,886
"Rock you very much."
Where 'd you get this?

1502
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,327
Carrie was always giving away
her swag.

1503
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:55,960
- So, what are you really doing here?
- What do you mean?

1504
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:59,642
Well, I'm not stupid. I know you didn't
come by to hang out. So come on.

1505
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:01,848
What's eating Veronica Mars?

1506
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,405
Oh, yeah.

1507
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,289
That.

1508
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:09,847
I'm pretty sure
you murdered Carrie Bishop...

1509
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,810
...because she was on the verge
of telling the truth about what happened...

1510
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,571
...with Susan Knight nine years ago.

1511
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:20,642
You are an insane person.

1512
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,484
I was in the 09er.

1513
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:24,051
Everyone saw me.

1514
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,531
You're right. I misspoke.

1515
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,045
You didn't kill her.

1516
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,851
You used your lady parts
to get Stu Cobbler to do it for you.

1517
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,526
Heh. Don't be gross.

1518
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:35,445
I just watched you
from across the street, Gia.

1519
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,726
I have pictures.

1520
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:40,566
If I had any Facebook friends,
they'd be enjoying them already.

1521
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:43,200
I'd say wait till your fiancé finds out...

1522
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,647
...but I'm gonna go ahead and guess
he's okay with it.

1523
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:49,044
You are protecting
his bright future, right?

1524
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:53,330
I mean, there are beards and then
there are beards that go the extra mile.

1525
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:56,324
I was at the 09er.
There are witnesses. Everybody saw me.

1526
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:57,606
Gia, keep up.

1527
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:58,807
We're past that now.

1528
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:00,367
I believe you.

1529
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:03,006
I even have proof you were there.

1530
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:05,401
Timestamped video.

1531
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,371
And right about now...

1532
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:11,126
...it's dawning on you
where this video came from.

1533
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:13,004
The camera on Carrie's tablet.

1534
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:17,968
Cobb took the tablet from Carrie's house
after he killed her.

1535
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:22,326
Here you are typing out the text
that'll get Logan over to Carrie's.

1536
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:26,287
I think the sheriff is gonna be
very interested in this video.

1537
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:40,888
Do you even remember Cobb
from high school?

1538
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:43,368
Just this total trailer-park weirdo.

1539
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:47,561
Creepy guy who sat behind me in Civics
reading <i>Guns & Camouﬂage</i> or whatever...

1540
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:51,088
...eye-screwing me
and smelling like old sponge.

1541
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,282
He had the good drugs, though.

1542
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,647
That night that we went out
on Carrie's boat...

1543
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,529
...we tried to hit him up for product...

1544
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:01,160
...but he insisted on us taking him with.

1545
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:05,089
We got so shit-faced
it didn't really matter.

1546
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:10,169
But then Susan, as usual...

1547
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:11,887
...bottoms out.

1548
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:13,680
She starts bawling about...

1549
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:17,203
...the baby that she gave up for adoption.

1550
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,885
She disappears below deck.

1551
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:23,131
Carrie found her later
and she was barely breathing.

1552
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:27,684
But Cobb says that she'd sleep it off.

1553
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:30,650
Because he'd seen it
a hundred times before.

1554
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,849
- And you believed him.
- We were out of our skulls.

1555
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,443
We were picturing jail time.

1556
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:40,002
Lost futures. Lost fortunes.

1557
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:44,847
And then Carrie went down
to check on Susan later.

1558
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:49,483
She was dead.

1559
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:52,043
Just full-on dead.

1560
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:55,448
It was Cobb's idea...

1561
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:59,004
...to weigh her down with an anchor.

1562
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:04,448
Then we're all sobbing and we're trying
to lift her body over the side.

1563
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,565
Dick was sobbing.

1564
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:09,121
Dick passed out before
any of this even happened.

1565
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:13,440
He never knew the truth.
He sells the lie better than any of us.

1566
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,767
But none of us even noticed...

1567
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:19,890
...that Cobb wasn't helping us
push Susan's body overboard.

1568
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:24,324
Later, after all the police-grilling
and media stuff...

1569
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:28,244
...Carrie, Luke and I get e-mailed...

1570
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,763
...a camera-phone photo...

1571
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,369
...of us dumping Susan's body.

1572
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:38,202
And he's owned us ever since.

1573
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:40,328
We bankroll him.

1574
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,130
We pal around with him.

1575
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:43,361
You sleep with him.

1576
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:45,807
Yeah, lucky me.
I'm the one he loves.

1577
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:51,048
He flashes the photo any time he thinks
one of us needs a reminder.

1578
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:55,081
Carrie needed a lot of reminders.

1579
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,322
He rented the apartment
across the street...

1580
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,801
...so that he can see me
whenever he wants to.

1581
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,408
I'm not even allowed to have curtains.

1582
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,881
He's probably watching us right now.

1583
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:07,607
Try to act ca...

1584
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:19,961
Hang in there, Gia.

1585
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:23,128
Hi. A cop has been shot.

1586
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:25,442
The 400 block of Exposition Boulevard.

1587
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,608
Help is coming, Gia.

1588
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,564
It's okay. Help is coming.

1589
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:36,687
Help.

1590
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,880
Gia could've really used
some curtains in here.

1591
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:06,641
I hope you don't mind a little mood music.

1592
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:09,565
<i>You'll never find</i>

1593
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,962
<i>As long as you live</i>

1594
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:17,006
<i>Someone who loves you</i>

1595
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:21,763
<i>Tender like I do</i>

1596
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:26,720
<i>You'll never find</i>

1597
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:31,209
<i>No matter where you search</i>

1598
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:35,203
<i>Someone who cares about you</i>

1599
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,606
<i>The way I do</i>

1600
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:44,522
<i>Whoa, I'm not bragging on myself, baby</i>

1601
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,602
<i>But I'm the one who loves you</i>

1602
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,888
<i>And there's no one else</i>

1603
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:50,788
<i>No one else</i>

1604
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,043
<i>You'll never find</i>

1605
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:03,040
<i>It'll take the end of all time</i>

1606
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,364
<i>Someone to understand you</i>

1607
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:11,720
<i>Like I do</i>

1608
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:24,527
<i>But I know somehow, someday, some way</i>

1609
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:25,767
<i>You are</i>

1610
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:31,608
<i>- Baby
- You're gonna miss my lovin'</i>

1611
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:34,764
<i>When it's cold outside</i>

1612
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:42,045
<i>You're gonna miss my lovin'</i>

1613
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:43,440
Wait for me, Veronica!

1614
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,443
<i>Yes, you will, baby</i>

1615
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:52,563
It's not a race.

1616
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,762
We all know how this ends.

1617
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:00,531
Ah.

1618
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:03,689
Ooh, you killed the lights.

1619
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:06,406
How wildly impressive.

1620
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:24,767
Eenie...

1621
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:27,969
...meenie...

1622
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:29,201
...miney...

1623
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,121
...eat me.

1624
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:38,851
Oh.

1625
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:51,443
Shocking photo surfaces
in the Bonnie De Ville murder case.

1626
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:53,881
Logan Echolls is a free man.
He's exonerated.

1627
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:58,284
And instead the local sheriff has arrested
Stu Cobbler and charged him with two murders:

1628
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,482
Bonnie DeVille and socialite Gia Goodman.

1629
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:04,121
How did you get it so wrong?
Did you ignore evidence?

1630
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,481
Did Gia Goodman have to die?

1631
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:07,642
If you think the sheriff
is squirming here...

1632
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:10,451
...check out the TMZ Live
exclusive video we got...

1633
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:13,331
...from the private investigator
working for Logan Echolls.

1634
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:16,929
I don't care if Logan ain't the guy.

1635
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:20,841
America thinks he's guilty,
and that's good enough for me.

1636
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:24,362
I'm betting I know exactly
what the people of Neptune want now.

1637
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:28,161
- I know too. A new sheriff.
- A new sheriff. Yeah, exactly.

1638
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:45,044
No, it's too early.

1639
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:48,761
You'd be surprised how strongly
the armed services feels about punctuality.

1640
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:52,210
You want me to get busted
for going AWOL?

1641
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:55,405
What I want...

1642
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:58,166
...is for you to stand there...

1643
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:00,368
...in that effity white uniform...

1644
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:04,445
...with your Harvard mouth
and show me some effing courtesy.

1645
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:08,170
Well, I appreciate
you keeping it PG-13 for me.

1646
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,243
I'm delicate.

1647
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,485
I got you off murder charges.

1648
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:16,207
- I can beat an AWOL rap.
- Listen, it's 180 days, Veronica.

1649
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,045
What's 180 days to us?

1650
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,928
Our story is epic.

1651
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:26,364
Spanning years, continents.

1652
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:29,650
Lives ruined, bloodshed.

1653
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,609
Yeah.

1654
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:38,922
Come back to me.

1655
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,127
Always.

1656
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:07,404
Two solid weeks of bliss,
and now it's back to the real world.

1657
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:09,528
He's a great kid.
A shoot-first point guard.

1658
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:13,287
- So, what now?
- But sometimes it kills us in the transitions...

1659
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:16,091
I had a ringside seat
to my mom's recovery attempts.

1660
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:19,329
I know all about accepting
the things I can't change.

1661
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:21,084
Veronica!

1662
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:24,562
Your point guard shoots too much.
I'm with you, Fennel. Bench him.

1663
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:28,048
I'm supposed to find the courage
to change the things I can.

1664
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:32,205
Even if it means disappointing
the one man I can't bear to disappoint.

1665
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:33,885
Gin.

1666
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:36,167
Who's your daddy?

1667
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:42,567
Well, my 2000-point lead shrinks by 40.

1668
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:43,767
Look at you.

1669
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:46,811
Not even knowing you're being hustled.
You're the patsy.

1670
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:48,405
I got the hook in now.

1671
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,683
Logan return to duty today?

1672
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:55,484
Yep.

1673
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:57,722
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Yeah.

1674
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:00,690
They say I'm ahead of schedule here.

1675
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:02,842
As much as I'm enjoying
this daddy-daughter time...

1676
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,791
...maybe it's time to start thinking about
heading back to New York?

1677
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:08,247
You've got a life there.

1678
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:10,928
Yeah.

1679
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,569
About New York...

1680
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:15,931
Let's be honest here.

1681
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:20,210
If I were wise enough to know the difference
between what I can and can't change...

1682
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:22,522
...would I even be who I am?

1683
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:24,449
Would this be what I'm doing?

1684
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,571
Last thing, that gun they planted on you?

1685
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:30,609
A stoolie claims you bought it from him.

1686
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:34,323
He clearly fears the sheriff
more than he fears you.

1687
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:38,644
Yeah.
Well, we'll see what we can do about that.

1688
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:40,689
Thanks, V.

1689
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:50,006
- How's it coming on the sheriff's password?
- JohnnyUtah69.

1690
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:54,603
Done. I just sent you his tax returns.

1691
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:56,404
Thank you.

1692
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:00,890
Dad always said this town
could wreck a person.

1693
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:04,362
It's what happens
when you're playing a rigged game.

1694
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:08,690
I convinced myself
winning meant getting out.

1695
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:13,687
But in what world do you get to
leave the ring and declare victory?

1696
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:16,409
This is where I belong.

1697
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,289
In the fight.

1698
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,050
It's who I am.

1699
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:22,925
I've rolled around in the mud
for so long.

1700
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:26,727
Wash me clean
and I don't recognize myself.

1701
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,406
So how about I just accept the mud...

1702
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:34,088
...and the tendency I have to find myself
rolling in it?

1703
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,325
My name is Veronica...

1704
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,369
...and I'm an addict.

1705
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:40,967
Hello, Veronica.

1706
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:10,924
Dorange.

1707
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:14,251
Yor-Eorange.

1708
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:16,888
Forange.

1709
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:19,482
Gorange.

1710
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:22,607
Horange.

1711
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:19,288
This is Logan reminding you...

1712
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:21,383
...if you're offered a seat
on a rocket ship...

1713
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:25,968
...don't ask which seat, just get on.
Sheryl Sandberg said that.

1714
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:29,761
So don't leave a message,
go get on that rocket ship.

1715
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:35,290
Or leave a message, your call.
Your decision will tell me a lot about you.
