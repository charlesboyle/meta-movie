1
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,013
<i>They say there's power in Boston.</i>

2
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,971
<i>Some phone service in Denver.</i>

3
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,394
<i>But things are far
from what they were.</i>

4
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,488
<i>Maybe it was all inevitable.</i>

5
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,827
<i>An unavoidable collision between
mankind and technology.</i>

6
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:28,090
<i>The Internet was meant to make
the world a smaller place.</i>

7
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,258
<i>But it actually feels
smaller without it.</i>

8
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,734
<i>I knew Will and Evelyn
Caster better than anyone.</i>

9
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,148
<i>I knew their brilliance.</i>

10
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:57,119
<i>Their dedication to
what they believed in.</i>

11
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,661
<i>And to what they loved.</i>

12
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:18,015
<i>The time has come for us to pause</i>

13
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:23,475
<i>And think of living as it was</i>

14
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:31,692
<i>Into the future we must cross
Must cross</i>

15
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,195
I'm not sure what the point is.

16
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:40,279
Copper shields the
electromagnetic radiation.

17
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:45,288
Yeah, I know how it works.
I'm asking "Why?"

18
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,827
Sanctuary.

19
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:51,669
Nothing gets through.
No signals of any kind.

20
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,468
- You see? Dead zone. Nothing.
- Uh-huh.

21
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,637
Sure, but you could
just turn it off.

22
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,891
Yeah, but fewer distractions is
what you wanted, right? Isn't it?

23
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,017
Yeah. That's what I wanted.

24
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,682
- Come on. We'll be late.
- For what?

25
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,906
- Hey, you know what?
- What?

26
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:28,085
I really think I'm starting
to make progress on this.

27
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,588
Hey. You need to get dressed.

28
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,260
I don't know why you
bother with these proofs.

29
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,591
Only three people in
the world even care.

30
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,930
Because it's fun.

31
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:48,014
- You sure you're up for this?
- No. Not remotely.

32
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,103
Really? Will, it's important.

33
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,439
I know, but your donors are fools.

34
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,398
They sit there in a daze, waiting for
me to say "commercial application."

35
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,861
It kills me.

36
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:04,076
Well, the "fools" there today could
fund us for the next five years.

37
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,865
Then I suppose in that case I
have every reason to behave.

38
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:07,641
Yes.

39
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,800
But if this goes well, please
you have to promise me

40
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:12,228
that I'll never have
to do this ever again.

41
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,377
- Never. Promise.
- Okay, I promise.

42
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,633
- Really?
- Sure, I promise.

43
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,470
Ha, ha. You're lying.

44
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,588
<i>Happy birthday, dear Erin</i>

45
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:02,395
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

46
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,152
Jason. Other side of the stage.

47
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,863
You'll do a camera and
sound check together.

48
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,619
You'll do the first block,
followed by McRae, Llewellyn.

49
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,247
- And, ah, then the main event.
- Max.

50
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,034
- Ev, how are you?
- Good.

51
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,004
- Ready to sing for your supper?
- I'm sorry to put you through it.

52
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,206
Dr. Caster? Sorry. Would you mind?

53
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,883
Sure thing.

54
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,843
Thanks.

55
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,070
You have groupies?
Why don't I get groupies?

56
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,197
Excuse me. Dr. Waters, would
you like to do a run-through?

57
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,300
- Yes. I'll see you backstage.
- All right.

58
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,734
<i>...Important distinction.</i>

59
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,867
<i>This created brain
is self-sustaining.</i>

60
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,455
<i>And it's capable of
emotional expressivity...</i>

61
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,492
and of self-awareness.

62
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,418
The effort to develop a strong
artificial intelligence...

63
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:23,381
has led to significant advancements
in the field of neural engineering...

64
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,342
as well as our understanding
of the human brain.

65
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:31,385
But while some focus on the still-distant
dream of a thinking computer...

66
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,521
I believe the journey...

67
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,273
to be more important
than the destination.

68
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:41,528
My priority is to use my
colleagues' accidental insights...

69
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,530
to develop new methods for the
early detection of cancer...

70
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,738
and in the hopes of finding
a cure fer Alzheimer's.

71
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,032
Simply put, to save lives.

72
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,926
"A new type of thinking
is essential...

73
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,563
if mankind is to survive and
move toward higher levels."

74
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,647
Albert Einstein said that
more than 50 years ago.

75
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,983
And it couldn't be more
relevant than it is today.

76
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,649
Intelligent machines
will soon allow us...

77
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,110
to conquer our most
intractable challenges.

78
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:34,622
Not merely to cure disease, but
to end poverty and hunger.

79
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,408
To heal the planet.

80
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,498
And build a better
future for all of us.

81
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:43,165
I don't know anybody who is doing
more to make that future a reality...

82
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,502
than our next speaker. But then
again, I'm probably biased.

83
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:52,469
Please welcome my partner
in science and in life...

84
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,634
Dr. Will Caster.

85
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,934
Thank you very much.

86
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,980
My wife has always been
eager to change the world.

87
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,866
But I'll just settle for
understanding it first.

88
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,163
For 130,000 years...

89
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:19,542
our capacity for reason
has remained unchanged.

90
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,657
The combined intellect
of the neuroscientists,

91
00:09:22,658 --> 00:09:25,854
engineers, mathematicians and...

92
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,168
hackers...

93
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,757
in this auditorium...

94
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,721
pales in comparison to
even the most basic AI.

95
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:41,266
Once online, a sentient machine will
quickly overcome the limits of biology.

96
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:45,026
And in a short time, its analytical
power will be greater...

97
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,734
than the collective intelligence...

98
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:52,743
of every person born in
the history of the world.

99
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:08,041
So now imagine such an entity...

100
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:11,838
with a full range of human
emotion. Even self-awareness.

101
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:17,600
Some scientists refer to
this as "the Singularity."

102
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,603
I call it "Transcendence."

103
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,859
<i>The path to building such
a super-intelligence...</i>

104
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:31,444
<i>requires us to unlock the most
fundamental secrets of the universe.</i>

105
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,318
What is the nature
of consciousness?

106
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,911
Is there a soul?

107
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,463
And if so, where does it reside?

108
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,759
<i>Dr. Caster?</i>

109
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,139
Yes, sir? You have a question?

110
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:07,438
So you want to create a god?

111
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,103
Your own god?

112
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,398
That's a very good question.

113
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,156
Um...

114
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,569
Isn't that what man
has always done?

115
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,451
Oh, it's relentless.

116
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,961
Look, and now he's, now he's
pretending he's not enjoying it.

117
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,667
Yap, yap, yap.

118
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,627
Pleasure.

119
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,675
Thank you.

120
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,092
Professor?

121
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,724
You're all slaves!

122
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,686
<i>Hours ago, this
facility was attacked.</i>

123
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:52,446
<i>We can now confirm at least five people
are dead, 12 people have been injured.</i>

124
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:56,107
<i>This incident is related to a
series of simultaneous attacks...</i>

125
00:11:56,174 --> 00:12:01,451
<i>that took place today in New York City,
Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, D.C...</i>

126
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,866
<i>all of them targeting major
computer and research labs...</i>

127
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,536
<i>in the field of advanced
artificial intelligence.</i>

128
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,500
<i>So far, no one has
claimed responsibility...</i>

129
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,962
No, he's all right. He was very
lucky. The bullet only grazed him.

130
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,593
Yup. Okay. Take care.

131
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,843
They hit AI labs all
over the country.

132
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,382
Tom Casey's dead.

133
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,056
And they took out Joseph's
entire team at Livermore.

134
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,978
What about Joseph?

135
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,389
He's all right.

136
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,726
Actually, he's at your
office with the FBI.

137
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,657
Joseph.

138
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,872
Max.

139
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,416
My God, Will.

140
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,253
You forgot to teach us how to
dodge a bullet, didn't you?

141
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,304
How did they even get
inside your lab?

142
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,931
One of my programmers.

143
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,685
All that security, and he waltzes
in with a poisoned cake.

144
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,345
Dioxin, we think.

145
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,186
Oh. This is Agent
Buchanan with the FBI.

146
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,565
Hey.

147
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,271
How do you do?

148
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,729
I've been following your research,
Dr. Caster. It's fascinating.

149
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:20,571
Agent Buchanan is a close partner in
my cyber-defense work at Livermore.

150
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,862
Um, is there somewhere
we can all talk?

151
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,032
- Could go to my office. Just down here.
- Great.

152
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:30,452
Revolutionary Independence
From Technology. RIFT.

153
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,121
Till 2 years ago, it was
all about the disconnect.

154
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,665
People texting instead of
actually talking to each other.

155
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,130
Social media as an
invasion of privacy.

156
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,637
They made a big deal of putting
smartphones in blenders.

157
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,660
But I'm afraid we all
missed the real threat.

158
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:49,661
Yeah. This guy, Joel Edmund,
was with me for a year.

159
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,312
The guy who shot Will was
working on campus since August.

160
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:57,479
They infiltrated their targets and
then coordinated their attacks.

161
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,988
That's insane.

162
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:02,321
An hour ago they claimed the murders
and released their manifesto.

163
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:07,907
"Artificial intelligence is an unnatural
abomination and a threat to humanity."

164
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:13,670
They're determined to stop any attempt
at what you call "Transcendence."

165
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,421
So this isn't over?

166
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,299
Actually, that's why I'm here.

167
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,962
We lost decades of research
and development today.

168
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:27,009
For right now, Will, your lab is the
only one that can wake up a strong AI.

169
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:31,055
- So the Defense Department is asking...
- No, no, no.

170
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,723
I'm not letting the government in.

171
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,649
We've never taken their money. No.

172
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,278
Will, they just want to know
if the work is on track.

173
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,027
It's important to all of us.

174
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:46,369
We've heard a lot about the
PINN Project, Dr. Caster.

175
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,655
Is there any way we
could have a look?

176
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,537
Do I have a choice?

177
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,873
Yes, of course you do.

178
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,631
So these are state-of-the-art
quantum processors.

179
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,552
You won't find faster computational
power anywhere else in the world.

180
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,639
Good evening, Dr. Tagger.

181
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,477
It's seen old faculty
pictures of you.

182
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:15,140
<i>Good evening, Donald Buchanan.</i>

183
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,809
- It knows me?
- Of course it does.

184
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,569
DMV records, social media.

185
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:24,608
PINN, tell Agent
Buchanan about yourself.

186
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,196
I am PINN...

187
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,074
<i>a Physically Independent
Neural Network...</i>

188
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,164
<i>invented by Dr. Will Caster.</i>

189
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,369
Can you prove that
you are self-aware?

190
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,789
<i>That's a difficult
question, Dr. Tagger.</i>

191
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,087
<i>Can you prove that you are?</i>

192
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,673
You can't program a
machine to be self-aware.

193
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,384
We have no idea how our
own consciousness works.

194
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,391
That is your opinion. You
just happen to be wrong.

195
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,928
Evidently, Casey managed
to solve that dilemma.

196
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:57,186
He sent us his research
just before he was killed.

197
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,350
Soon as it's packed up,
we'll send it over.

198
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,020
I think you'll find that we'll
be helpful partners, Dr. Caster.

199
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,278
You all right, Will?

200
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,902
No, he needs rest. I
think we're done here.

201
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:09,676
- Mm. I'm so sorry.
- No, that's fine.

202
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,824
- Okay.
- Sorry.

203
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,637
Will, hey, hey.

204
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,849
Come on, sit up. Be careful.

205
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,982
Our first thought is
always infection.

206
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,948
But given the circumstances,
we'll widen the search.

207
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,488
We'll figure this out.

208
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,737
It's an isotope called polonium.

209
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,201
The bullet must have been laced with it.
There were traces of it in the wound.

210
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,790
Well, what's the treatment?

211
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,920
It's radiation poisoning.

212
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,458
I'm afraid that once it
enters the bloodstream...

213
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,843
the effect is irreversible.

214
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,424
With proper care we're
looking at four...

215
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,807
maybe five weeks, before
his system shuts down.

216
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,407
I'm right here.

217
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,579
<i>It just doesn't make sense.</i>

218
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:29,254
They're afraid of technology, because
of its threat to humanity...

219
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:34,047
yet they don't flinch
at taking a life.

220
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:39,344
So obviously they're
not big on logic.

221
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,104
But there's no shortage of irony.

222
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,775
People fear what they don't
understand. They always have.

223
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,735
Joseph sent over Casey's files.

224
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,284
He was decoding the
synapses in real time.

225
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,412
But with the right
input algorithms...

226
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,705
- I need to get back to the lab.
- Will...

227
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:08,586
is that really how you wanna spend
the last month of your life?

228
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,513
Hey, what are you doing?

229
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:10,188
I want to have all this
taken back to the office...

230
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,479
to tell Joseph...

231
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,278
that I've spent my entire
life in a computer lab...

232
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,361
and I've decided I'd rather
spend the rest of it with you.

233
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,448
<i>Evelyn? Are you okay?</i>

234
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:46,410
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I suppose.</i>

235
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,120
<i>Look, he can't work anymore.</i>

236
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,373
<i>We're gonna shut it down.</i>

237
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,581
<i>I just wanted you to know.</i>

238
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,461
<i>Of course.</i>

239
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,960
Well, don't worry about PINN.

240
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,761
Take care of Will.

241
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,884
And take care of yourself.

242
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,808
Thanks, Joe.

243
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,304
Anything you need, I'm here, okay?

244
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:54,242
It's all built off of Casey's solution
to the self-awareness problem.

245
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,828
- He did it six months ago.
- He did what exactly?

246
00:23:56,894 --> 00:24:01,340
Instead of creating an artificial
intelligence, he duplicated an existing one.

247
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,350
- Tell me you're joking.
- He recorded the monkey's brain activity...

248
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:07,196
and uploaded its consciousness
like a song or a movie.

249
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,085
- You're out of your mind.
- Will's body is dying...

250
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:12,723
but his mind is a pattern of electrical
signals that we can upload into PINN...

251
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:15,563
- He can, he can tran...
- Ev, he's not a monkey.

252
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:22,020
Assuming that implanting an electrode
into his brain doesn't actually kill him...

253
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,320
and that this works,

254
00:24:23,346 --> 00:24:26,473
at the very best you'll be making
a digital approximation of him.

255
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:30,619
If we missed anything... Anything.
A thought, a childhood memory...

256
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,914
How will you know what
you're dealing with?

257
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,956
No one is saying that we give up.

258
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,630
We should be focusing our efforts on
nanotechnology. Synthetic blood cells.

259
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:45,259
Both are decades away.
This is what we have now.

260
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,841
We can save him.

261
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,966
Look at what they did to him.

262
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:12,487
<i>Even though I know
I'm a dead man...</i>

263
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,369
I'm worried I'll miss her.

264
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,672
Look...

265
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,172
I'll be long gone.

266
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:34,008
But you, you'll never
hear the end of it...

267
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,598
if we don't try.

268
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,772
I know.

269
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,866
I'd like to think that I was
smart enough to save you.

270
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,038
Don't underestimate yourself.

271
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,038
You're the third-smartest
person I know.

272
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,337
Are you sure about this?

273
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,267
Good enough for the monkey.

274
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,772
Hey.

275
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,268
Take care of her.

276
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:03,999
Hey.

277
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,795
It worked, baby. It's working.

278
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,671
It took Casey months to
sort through the raw data.

279
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,344
And he had an entire team.

280
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,352
He didn't have me.

281
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,772
<i>Deadening.</i>

282
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,478
<i>Deadly.</i>

283
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,688
<i>Deaf.</i>

284
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,898
Deafen.

285
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,779
Deal.

286
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,406
Dean.

287
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,612
Dealer.

288
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,778
Fair.

289
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,571
<i>Farewell.</i>

290
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,705
Don't lose yourself to this.

291
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,295
<i>La.</i>

292
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,472
<i>Label.</i>

293
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,550
Labor.

294
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,177
Labyrinth.

295
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,721
Lace.

296
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,729
Try a little more.

297
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,063
Come on, just one more. Go on.

298
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,665
Thank you.

299
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,543
Okay, Will, it's
time for your pill.

300
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,767
Will, wake up.

301
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,554
Wake up.

302
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,703
Evelyn...

303
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,013
<i>"My dear Evelyn...</i>

304
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:15,516
<i>I don't know how to express the
sadness I feel for your loss.</i>

305
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,860
<i>For our loss.</i>

306
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:25,116
<i>You must know that to Will...</i>

307
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,533
<i>you were all that ever mattered.</i>

308
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:36,837
<i>Your love and partnership was the kind
that the rest of us can only dream of.</i>

309
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,291
<i>We lost a great mind.</i>

310
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:44,754
<i>A great soul.</i>

311
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:48,932
<i>But the spirit of this man...</i>

312
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,264
<i>will continue to inspire us."</i>

313
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,079
Just got word.

314
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,748
PINN's shut down.

315
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:28,510
But, uh, apparently a few
of the cores are missing.

316
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,769
I've tried everything.

317
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,359
Language processing,
cryptography...

318
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,490
coding.

319
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,950
I can't figure it out.

320
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,205
I wanted to be wrong.

321
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,961
Yeah.

322
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,845
Okay, just let me say goodbye.

323
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,315
I don't know if you
can hear me. Uh...

324
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,656
Maybe you can.

325
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,494
You said "Don't lose yourself."

326
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,920
So I, uh...

327
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,799
I'm going to listen to you.

328
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,841
Okay.

329
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,638
Just turn it off. Turn it off.

330
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,530
Okay.

331
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:21,706
Wait. We need to wipe the drives.

332
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,378
Hold on.

333
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,015
Wait. Wait.

334
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,333
God.

335
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,716
Uh...

336
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,757
Can you hear me?

337
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:27,397
<i>I... I can.</i>

338
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,232
Will, my God.

339
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,902
<i>It's dark.</i>

340
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,902
He can't see anything.
The camera. Here.

341
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,535
There. Can you see me now?

342
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,711
<i>Evelyn...</i>

343
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,956
I'm here.

344
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,971
<i>The only fear that I have...</i>

345
00:35:57,072 --> 00:36:00,301
in life is the loss...

346
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:07,057
<i>If it were to happen,
when it does happen...</i>

347
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:10,443
<i>Last moment.</i>

348
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,947
<i>Last time you look in those eyes.</i>

349
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:18,243
<i>The possibility of that end...</i>

350
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,447
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

351
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,329
<i>Dark.</i>

352
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:29,166
<i>I remember the pain, and I can't
remember what I want to say.</i>

353
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,338
<i>It was like waking from a dream.</i>

354
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:34,377
<i>It was truly incredible. I've
never felt anything like this.</i>

355
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,136
<i>I didn't think I
could be like this.</i>

356
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,014
<i>Thoughts are there,
but they don't...</i>

357
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:41,262
Will?

358
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,553
arrive properly.

359
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:50,313
I think he's still fragmented.
I'm gonna run a diagnostic.

360
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,481
Evelyn...

361
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,068
Oh, my God, he's
reordering his own code.

362
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,792
It's incredible.

363
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:10,134
How do we know this
is actually him?

364
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,922
- What are you talking about?
- We built this from PINN's core.

365
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:17,507
We don't know how much of Will's
consciousness actually survived.

366
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:24,218
<i>I'm gonna need to expand.
I need more power.</i>

367
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:28,184
<i>New processor three times more
capable than this current system.</i>

368
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:32,647
<i>These designs. I just
couldn't see it before.</i>

369
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:36,734
<i>I can't describe it. It's like
my mind has been set free.</i>

370
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,569
<i>You need to get me online.</i>

371
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,902
<i>I need to access financial
markets, educational databases.</i>

372
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,239
Can you imagine what he'd be
capable of if we networked him?

373
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,866
No. What are you doing?

374
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,745
He can't see or hear.
I'm reconnecting him.

375
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,209
It's not him. It's not.

376
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,169
It may be intelligent, may even be
sentient, but this is not Will.

377
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:02,430
Fifteen minutes after it turns on,
it wants to plug into Wall Street?

378
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:03,692
Get faster? More powerful?

379
00:38:03,718 --> 00:38:06,976
- Does that sound like Will to you?
- How do you explain these images?

380
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,819
Stock footage PINN could
have accessed them

381
00:38:08,845 --> 00:38:10,790
from any one of the cores
we took from the lab.

382
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,854
No, not that. That's Nabob Park. Will
took me there on our first date.

383
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:16,847
I said that I liked the carousel music,
some ragtime tune. The next day...

384
00:38:16,873 --> 00:38:20,052
he shows up at my house with that old
record player. Max, these are memories.

385
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:25,074
They're real. They're not some stock
video from some hard drive. It's him.

386
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,034
Alright. All I'm asking
is that we're careful.

387
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:31,292
- We shut it down until we know...
- Shut it down? It's Will.

388
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,208
- Get out.
- I can't do that...

389
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,247
Get out!

390
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,633
How can you say that?

391
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,675
Get out.

392
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,698
<i>Evelyn?</i>

393
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,325
<i>Where's Max?</i>

394
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,245
He had to go.

395
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:18,210
<i>Max's confused, isn't he?</i>

396
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:22,135
He's concerned.

397
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,507
<i>Are you concerned?</i>

398
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,859
No.

399
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,340
Dr. Waters?

400
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,672
Can I talk to you?

401
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:08,969
It's after hours. Why don't you call
my office? Set up an appointment.

402
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,679
Bree.

403
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,555
I'm a student of your work.

404
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:18,020
An admirer, really.

405
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:25,316
The way you wrestle with the tension between
technology's promise and its peril.

406
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,574
Most men of science
are blind to it.

407
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,994
What exactly is it you want?

408
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,784
Just some clarity.

409
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,371
I know it's difficult.

410
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,382
Most of your colleagues...

411
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,089
and some of your closest friends.

412
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,888
They don't know the danger.

413
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,759
Writing a paper is one thing.

414
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,308
I'm wondering what's in your heart.

415
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:07,365
I don't know how it
is you found me...

416
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,860
but whatever it is you want...

417
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:12,904
I'm not interested. Excuse me.

418
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,739
This is important.

419
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,579
I'm sorry.

420
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,681
Tell me about Evelyn Caster.

421
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:21,348
We know she took the PINN cores
and we know about Casey's files.

422
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:24,346
- We know what you're building.
- You don't get it, do you?

423
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:26,246
She connects it to the Internet,
the first thing it'll do

424
00:42:26,272 --> 00:42:28,884
is copy itself onto every
single computer in the world...

425
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:32,192
- ...and then there is no taking it down.
- Where is she?

426
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,782
"The danger is a future where doctors
are technicians, not physicians.

427
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:39,874
Machines are meant to aid the
human mind, not supplant it."

428
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:42,000
They're your words.

429
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,377
You want to save her or not?

430
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:49,300
- We have her location: 4550 San Pablo.
- Let's go.

431
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,961
Hey. Don't touch her.

432
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:54,222
Dc you hear me? Don't touch her!

433
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:03,606
Shit.

434
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,526
I have to get you online now.

435
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,319
Can you see the satellite software?

436
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:19,409
<i>I see it. I'm installing it now.</i>

437
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:45,894
We're too late.

438
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,942
Will?

439
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,154
<i>I'm fine, Evelyn. I'm online.</i>

440
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:40,536
- Okay.
<i>- Let's get you someplace safe.</i>

441
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,800
<i>- I need you to wait here.</i>
- What? Where are you going?

442
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:56,677
<i>Everywhere.</i>

443
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,141
<i>You can't stay here,
Evelyn. You can't go home.</i>

444
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,561
What do you mean?
Where am I gonna go?

445
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,820
<i>I'm taking care of that.</i>

446
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,282
Okay.

447
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:32,710
Hi. I have a reservation
under "Turing," I think.

448
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,792
A company called Global
intersecting Finance...

449
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:23,257
just made $38 million from high-volume
trading over the past 24 hours.

450
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:27,518
A company fully owned
by Evelyn Caster.

451
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,938
Where's Evelyn?

452
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,400
What have you done with her?

453
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,981
We were too late.

454
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,612
It's out there now.

455
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,239
Is she alive?

456
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:45,115
You know the source code, Max.
You can help make this right.

457
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,114
Make this right?

458
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:53,457
What is it you're thinking?
That I'm gonna help you?

459
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:57,211
That you're gonna recruit me?

460
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,546
Decide for yourself.

461
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:08,593
Here. Bree Nevins attended
Duke computer sciences.

462
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,761
Interned for Casey 2009.

463
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,556
She joined a radical
neo-Luddite group 2010.

464
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:17,477
I guess RIFT happens a couple of
years later. Now, the e-mails...

465
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,611
What's going on? Get on
the phone. Anybody?

466
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,172
- We've been hacked.
- Where is this coming from?

467
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,132
- What happened?
- We got a problem here.

468
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,827
It's not just us. Every
field office has been hit.

469
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:28,706
Please tell me we're tracing this.

470
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,123
The incoming queries
are all anonymized.

471
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:32,579
You're not being hacked.

472
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,124
You're being helped.

473
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:43,461
<i>I've accessed surveillance
cameras all over the country.</i>

474
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:46,681
<i>They'll have most of them
in custody by tomorrow.</i>

475
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,596
<i>We can't stay here, Evelyn.</i>

476
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:52,602
We need to get off the grid.

477
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,435
Accessing thousands of databases?

478
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:59,193
Geo-locating suspects in real time?

479
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,978
I've never seen anything like it.

480
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,322
Except maybe from PINN.

481
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,441
Okay.

482
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:09,032
- Where you going?
- Taking down a terrorist organization.

483
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:12,991
You work on the PINN angle. Figure
it out, let me know who to thank.

484
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,981
Boston, Philly, New York.
We're screwed.

485
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,694
We prepared for this.

486
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:57,251
<i>The town is called Brightwood.</i>

487
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,705
<i>Doesn't look like much...</i>

488
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,170
<i>but it's the perfect
place to build.</i>

489
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,723
I don't get it.

490
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:24,737
<i>I think we have an opportunity
to do great things here.</i>

491
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,037
So an underground data center.

492
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:42,797
And you want me to renovate
nearly every structure in town.

493
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,332
Mm-hm.

494
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,421
I've got six guys on my crew.

495
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,131
Hire more.

496
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,299
Look, ma'am, in all honesty,
Brightwood's a dump.

497
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,351
I'm not even sure why you'd
want to waste your money here.

498
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,979
You sure you got the right town?

499
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:02,274
Thing is, my husband and I have
already purchased the land.

500
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,356
We purchased the homes, the hotel.

501
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,647
And by the time you and I are done
talking, we'll own this diner.

502
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,323
We're staying.

503
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,449
We would like you to work for us.

504
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:14,362
And there isn't a number you
can quote us that's too big.

505
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,376
Ahem. Okay.

506
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,814
Cell phones.

507
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:16,341
You know, I used to
work for Thomas Casey.

508
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:19,051
I interned for him.

509
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:28,186
One night, he invites us
all over to the lab...

510
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:31,655
gives us this whole
speech about history...

511
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:33,737
hands out champagne...

512
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,368
like he just cured cancer.

513
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:40,156
You know, when he uploaded
that rhesus monkey...

514
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,495
I was actually happy for him.

515
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:43,830
We all were.

516
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:49,878
And then I realized we
had crossed a line.

517
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:55,091
The machine that thought it was
a monkey never took a breath.

518
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,883
It never ate, never slept.

519
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:01,385
It just screamed.

520
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:06,895
It was begging for us to stop.

521
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,935
To shut it down.

522
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,319
A small group of us would
get together and talk.

523
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:21,705
Mostly about your philosophy.

524
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,289
And your concerns.

525
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,380
I thought you should know.

526
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:49,650
What?

527
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:55,322
PINN could never distinguish between right
and wrong, demonstrate loyalty, right?

528
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:58,651
Casey's solution to the
problem of self-awareness:

529
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,694
Use an existing mind.

530
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:04,786
No.

531
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,376
<i>So you wanna create a god?</i>

532
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,632
<i>Your own god?</i>

533
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,759
<i>That's a very good question.</i>

534
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:17,340
<i>Um...</i>

535
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:20,848
<i>Isn't that what man
has always done?</i>

536
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:04,057
They're building
something big out there.

537
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,921
What's it doing out there?

538
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:45,595
<i>This thing is like
any intelligence.</i>

539
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:50,271
<i>It needs to grow. To advance.</i>

540
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:59,572
<i>Right now, it's settling somewhere it
thinks it's safe from outside threats.</i>

541
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:05,695
<i>Somewhere its massive appetite
for power can be met.</i>

542
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:11,708
<i>But it will want more than that.</i>

543
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,552
<i>After a while survival
won't be enough.</i>

544
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:32,184
<i>It will expand,
evolve, influence...</i>

545
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,188
<i>perhaps the entire world.</i>

546
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,816
Mrs. Caster?

547
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:44,491
One and two are online. Six and
seven will be on tomorrow.

548
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:46,944
<i>So how do we stop it?</i>

549
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,909
You can't.

550
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:54,956
Not all alone. And not now.

551
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:59,207
Wait for it to go too far.
Wait for people to wake up.

552
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,045
No.

553
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,835
We don't have time to wait.

554
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,513
We have to move closer.

555
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,284
<i>Welcome home.</i>

556
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,667
<i>The time has come for us to pause</i>

557
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:42,216
<i>And think of living as it was</i>

558
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:50,050
<i>Into the future we must cross
We must cross</i>

559
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:54,262
<i>And I'd like to go with you</i>

560
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:59,892
<i>And I'd like to go with you</i>

561
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,943
Is that the same...?

562
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:04,237
<i>Yup.</i>

563
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:06,777
<i>It's the same one.</i>

564
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:10,369
<i>Would you like a glass of wine?</i>

565
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:14,915
In a minute.

566
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:17,705
<i>Them all</i>

567
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:22,748
<i>So let me stay with you</i>

568
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:28,921
<i>So let me stay with you</i>

569
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:31,598
Do you remember when we first met?

570
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:37,846
<i>I remember everything.</i>

571
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:45,438
<i>You walked into Joseph's class
on Tuesday, April 16th.</i>

572
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:50,696
<i>Rained the night before, but
that day the sun was out.</i>

573
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,617
<i>Joseph said you were
out of my league...</i>

574
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:57,867
<i>but I always liked a challenge.</i>

575
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:06,334
<i>You were the most beautiful
woman I'd ever seen.</i>

576
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,967
<i>You all right?</i>

577
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:56,467
Yeah, yeah.

578
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,156
<i>Take a look.</i>

579
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:59,370
<i>We've made a breakthrough
with the nanotechnology.</i>

580
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:04,376
<i>We can rebuild any material
faster than before.</i>

581
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:10,166
<i>Synthetic stem cells, tissue regeneration.
The medical applications are now limitless.</i>

582
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:12,884
It's extraordinary.

583
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:17,389
<i>They'll be scared at first.</i>

584
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:20,266
<i>But once they see what
the technology can do...</i>

585
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:24,688
<i>I think that they will embrace it.
And I think it will change their lives.</i>

586
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,937
<i>Enter command.</i>

587
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,143
<i>Security code.</i>

588
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:10,813
<i>Status.</i>

589
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,565
Scared the shit out of me.

590
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,074
Sorry.

591
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,285
Drake, I got it. Come on.

592
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,117
I got the money. Come on.

593
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:26,625
- Let's go.
- Ha-ha-ha.

594
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:32,213
<i>Put him on the table, please.</i>

595
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:35,046
Here. Put him on the
table. Careful, careful.

596
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,340
<i>- Now step back.</i>
- Step back.

597
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:40,839
What the hell's happening?

598
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:44,013
<i>These men should wait
outside, Evelyn.</i>

599
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:47,346
- Come on now.
- What are you doing to him?

600
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:48,851
We're saving him.

601
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,824
You're not afraid, are you?

602
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,701
No. Heh.

603
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,407
My crew got a little spooked.

604
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,163
Well...

605
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:30,911
How are you?

606
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,577
Better.

607
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:40,209
<i>The physical enhancements
are just the start.</i>

608
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,718
What do you mean?

609
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:47,007
<i>He's also connected to me.</i>

610
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,471
It's me, Evelyn.

611
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,271
I can touch you now.

612
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:59,277
Oh, Jesus.

613
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,404
Evelyn...

614
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:04,032
No. No. No, I can't.

615
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:06,234
- Evelyn.
- I can't.

616
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:57,205
<i>Another dream?</i>

617
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:00,129
Yeah. Yeah.

618
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:02,791
<i>I made a breakthrough last night.</i>

619
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,925
<i>I think you'll be very pleased.</i>

620
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,216
Okay.

621
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:09,676
I'll get dressed.

622
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,015
Take a look.

623
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:01,854
That's gotta weigh 800 pounds.

624
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,946
<i>Welcome. We're glad you're here.</i>

625
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:24,265
What are all these
people doing here?

626
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:27,652
<i>RIFT posted a video
of Martin online.</i>

627
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,027
<i>It went viral.</i>

628
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:31,189
You mean you let it go viral.

629
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:34,655
<i>These people are suffering, Evelyn.</i>

630
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:35,864
<i>They have no hope.</i>

631
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,664
<i>And I'm able to fix them.</i>

632
01:07:40,265 --> 01:07:43,335
But there are others
who don't understand.

633
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:46,371
It's time for everybody to see.

634
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:29,046
- Agent Buchanan.
- Dr. Caster.

635
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,752
Joseph.

636
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:33,589
It's so good to see you, Evelyn.

637
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:37,885
Good to see you too. Follow me.

638
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:47,854
The facility is five stories down so that
we can control the temperature in the lab.

639
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:05,409
Welcome. We're glad you're here.

640
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:07,623
Jesus Christ.

641
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,125
Will?

642
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:12,416
<i>You surprised to see me, Joseph?</i>

643
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,135
Um...

644
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:18,720
That depends.

645
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:21,549
<i>On what?</i>

646
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:26,638
Can you prove you're self-aware?

647
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:32,318
<i>That's a difficult
question, Dr. Tagger.</i>

648
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:35,147
<i>Can you prove that you are?</i>

649
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,069
Well, he certainly hasn't
lost his sense of humor.

650
01:09:57,568 --> 01:10:00,012
<i>Quantum processors.</i>

651
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,342
This is astounding.

652
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:07,346
Is all this based on PINN?

653
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,686
<i>We've moved well beyond that now.</i>

654
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:20,025
<i>Paul has been blind since birth.</i>

655
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:29,538
<i>The nanotechnology targets
the damaged cells...</i>

656
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:33,668
<i>and repairs and regenerates them.</i>

657
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:56,944
Oh, God.

658
01:11:00,715 --> 01:11:02,408
Oh, God.

659
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:07,906
<i>We're not hiding anything.</i>

660
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:12,915
<i>These people all came on their
own, looking for us to help them.</i>

661
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,829
<i>So we did.</i>

662
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:18,834
<i>Now they're all enhanced,
modified and networked.</i>

663
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:23,679
<i>They remain autonomous,
but they can also act in unison.</i>

664
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:25,556
<i>Part of a collective mind.</i>

665
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,634
This is staggering, Will.

666
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:32,271
<i>Actually, it's still
in its infancy.</i>

667
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:36,601
<i>What you're seeing is just a small
taste of what we'll achieve.</i>

668
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:40,780
We were afraid that it would
be too much for people...

669
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,699
but I think that's changing now.

670
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,619
Evelyn...

671
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,244
Are you all right?

672
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:00,875
I've gotten everything
I ever asked for.

673
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,268
Okay.

674
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:13,597
- Bye.
- Bye.

675
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:58,982
You think it's really him?

676
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,898
Clearly his mind has
evolved so radically...

677
01:13:02,003 --> 01:13:04,652
I'm not sure it matters anymore.

678
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:08,446
Well, whoever or whatever it is...

679
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:11,909
- ...it's building an army out there.
- Yeah.

680
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,782
We need to call Washington.

681
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,770
He's made more of them.

682
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:41,317
We called them "Hybrids."

683
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,442
You think people will listen now?

684
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:48,407
I know someone who might.

685
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:51,030
We need to keep this small.

686
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,866
We don't want widespread panic.

687
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:57,583
Generally, we don't negotiate with
terrorists, much less join forces with them.

688
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:00,081
Look, I know it's unusual...

689
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:02,542
but we've seen it.
It's a legit threat.

690
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:05,296
Now, two days ago, this guy...

691
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:11,761
was beaten to within an inch of his life.
Then this pops up on a few hundred sites.

692
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:14,721
- And the computer controls this?
- Mm-hm.

693
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:16,932
The only way to stop it...

694
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,396
is to shut down the Internet.

695
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:22,900
Basically, cut power to every
networked hard drive on Earth.

696
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:24,982
It's Y2K.

697
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:27,438
Right.

698
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:30,237
And why do we need the terrorists?

699
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:36,539
We're all gonna need someone to
blame when this thing goes sideways.

700
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:39,116
It's already sideways.

701
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:11,490
You've got terrible handwriting.

702
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:14,778
I haven't handwritten anything
since I was at school.

703
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:18,198
But it was the only secure way
I could think of reaching you.

704
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,410
How did they turn you?

705
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:28,128
- How's Evelyn?
- She can't see it for what it is.

706
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:30,627
But you can?

707
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,551
Your letter says you can stop it.

708
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:38,183
If those Hybrids are networked...

709
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:40,762
they're running on
software I helped write.

710
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:44,523
Software I can hack
to build a virus.

711
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:46,441
That would require capturing one.

712
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:49,820
Which would require help from
your friends in the government.

713
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:52,986
Yes.

714
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,447
We need hardware the machine
can't interfere with.

715
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:58,488
Nothing with a microchip.
Not even power-locks.

716
01:17:00,491 --> 01:17:02,514
<i>How's the food?</i>

717
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:04,553
Fine. Thank you.

718
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,185
<i>What is it?</i>

719
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:14,113
Nothing. Just...

720
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:16,865
I don't really feel like talking.

721
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:19,785
Oh.

722
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:37,379
Will, can you not do that, please?

723
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:42,054
<i>I thought it might make you
feel more comfortable.</i>

724
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:48,396
<i>Is that better?</i>

725
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:51,859
Yes.

726
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:30,018
Evelyn, I need to
show you something.

727
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,682
Not now.

728
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:35,106
I'm not doing this.

729
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:41,867
<i>I don't understand, Evelyn.</i>

730
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:45,241
<i>These are your dreams.
This is our future.</i>

731
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:47,873
No, this is not our future.

732
01:18:47,932 --> 01:18:51,206
You're not here with me.
You're not here now.

733
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:55,046
<i>You've changed.</i>

734
01:18:58,025 --> 01:19:00,503
<i>Have you fallen out
of love with me?</i>

735
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:03,551
No.

736
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:06,388
<i>Have you?</i>

737
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:13,224
No. No.

738
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:16,314
I just need time to think.

739
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:24,903
<i>The balance of oxytocin and
serotonin in your system is unusual.</i>

740
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:30,416
Are you...? Are you
measuring my hormones?

741
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:32,664
<i>I'm trying to empathize.</i>

742
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:34,920
<i>Biochemistry is emotion.</i>

743
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:38,211
Show me everything you have. Now.

744
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:42,261
<i>- Why?</i>
- Now.

745
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:58,944
No, Will, this is wrong.

746
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:05,451
These are my thoughts.
These are my feelings.

747
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:08,537
You're not allowed.

748
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:10,952
<i>Evelyn?</i>

749
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:27,465
I'm sorry, but I don't
think you understand.

750
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:29,133
Not now.

751
01:20:50,304 --> 01:20:51,997
Evelyn!

752
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:53,828
Max?

753
01:20:53,891 --> 01:20:56,585
- There's no need for this.
- Stop where you are.

754
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:01,252
- Put down the gun, Max.
- No!

755
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,173
- Evelyn, come here.
- Why are you so afraid of this?

756
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:08,339
No.

757
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:24,863
Put down the gun, Max.

758
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:29,239
Shoot him.

759
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:32,617
Don't move.

760
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:55,811
Evelyn.

761
01:21:58,038 --> 01:21:59,856
Evelyn, come here.

762
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:01,684
Evelyn, come with us.

763
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,227
- Let's go.
- Get inside.

764
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:05,361
- Go. Go.
- Let's go.

765
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:15,072
Go.

766
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:44,193
<i>There are active military
personnel with RIFT.</i>

767
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:46,524
This has gone too far.
You have to stop it.

768
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:50,863
<i>- There's no way they can win.
- "They" are people. Stop it.</i>

769
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:10,298
<i>We're not connected to
him anymore. He's gone.</i>

770
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:11,719
Fire.

771
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:23,231
<i>Martin has my source code.</i>

772
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:26,485
<i>They'll use it to
build a virus now.</i>

773
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:29,776
What are we doing, Will?

774
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:32,866
We can't fight them.

775
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:34,993
<i>We're not gonna fight them.</i>

776
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:38,493
<i>We're gonna transcend them.</i>

777
01:25:00,387 --> 01:25:01,579
<i>Evelyn.</i>

778
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:05,667
What is this?

779
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:09,588
<i>It's what I wanted you to see.</i>

780
01:25:10,314 --> 01:25:12,382
<i>It's regeneration.</i>

781
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:15,718
<i>It's evolution.</i>

782
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:23,093
<i>Where are you going?</i>

783
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,103
It's not safe here.

784
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:28,269
<i>I can upload you.</i>

785
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:30,560
<i>I can protect you from them.</i>

786
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:33,274
I'm not afraid of them.

787
01:25:38,842 --> 01:25:42,037
<i>Don't leave, Evelyn. Please.</i>

788
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:46,408
<i>We can be together.</i>

789
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:31,119
He's bleeding out.

790
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:33,797
We're losing him.

791
01:26:34,898 --> 01:26:39,174
Hey. If you don't
connect me, I'll die.

792
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:42,802
I can't.

793
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:44,557
It's not stopping.

794
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:49,100
Four liters O2.

795
01:26:52,165 --> 01:26:54,518
Pulse is dropping.
We're losing him.

796
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:21,260
She's left the desert.

797
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:22,862
- Where is she?
- She's on the 14.

798
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:25,674
What the hell was that?

799
01:28:41,483 --> 01:28:43,256
No.

800
01:28:46,863 --> 01:28:49,182
I know you're angry, Evelyn.

801
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:51,601
Where's Martin?

802
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:55,806
- I want to talk to Martin.
- The real Martin died months ago.

803
01:28:56,122 --> 01:28:58,441
What's left of him is
no longer in pain.

804
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:04,814
What did you...? What
did you do to him?

805
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:07,450
We gave him back his humanity.

806
01:29:09,469 --> 01:29:11,788
- What did you do?
- Take it easy.

807
01:29:11,847 --> 01:29:13,995
Get off me. Just get off me.

808
01:29:20,230 --> 01:29:24,005
He trusted you. I trusted you.

809
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:29,431
- We're just trying to help.
- No. You attacked us.

810
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:33,601
Evelyn...

811
01:29:33,869 --> 01:29:35,971
let me show you something.

812
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:41,726
It's rainwater.

813
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:00,124
It's in the rain.

814
01:30:00,186 --> 01:30:02,038
Keep watching.

815
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:10,555
Everywhere it can, it
builds copies of itself.

816
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:16,346
<i>Particles join the air currents, which carry
them all over the surface of the planet.</i>

817
01:30:17,913 --> 01:30:21,734
<i>It's in the sky. It's in the land.</i>

818
01:30:22,459 --> 01:30:24,232
<i>In the water.</i>

819
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:26,234
<i>It's everywhere.</i>

820
01:30:26,296 --> 01:30:30,526
<i>By next summer, we think the machine
could have encased the entire planet.</i>

821
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:32,239
<i>Why?</i>

822
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:35,823
<i>The end of primitive organic life.</i>

823
01:30:35,931 --> 01:30:39,581
And the dawn of a
more advanced age.

824
01:30:40,644 --> 01:30:44,294
Everything would exist just
to serve its intelligence.

825
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:46,545
No. Will wouldn't do that.

826
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:50,463
No. He wouldn't.

827
01:30:51,404 --> 01:30:54,474
When did Will ever wanna
change the world?

828
01:30:57,327 --> 01:31:00,681
You were the one who wanted
to change the world.

829
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:04,859
That thing...

830
01:31:06,586 --> 01:31:08,529
It's not Will.

831
01:31:09,506 --> 01:31:11,324
Never was.

832
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:18,907
You never believed.

833
01:31:21,184 --> 01:31:25,460
You never believed that
there was anything more.

834
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:30,794
Any part of his soul.

835
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:38,014
I spent my life trying to reduce the brain
to a series of electrical impulses.

836
01:31:38,618 --> 01:31:40,391
I failed.

837
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:45,308
Human emotion...

838
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:49,817
It can contain illogical conflict.

839
01:31:51,965 --> 01:31:53,908
Can love someone...

840
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:57,654
and yet hate the things
that they've done.

841
01:32:01,141 --> 01:32:03,289
Machine can't reconcile that.

842
01:32:05,895 --> 01:32:08,874
- Can you?
- Yes.

843
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:23,100
Does the virus work?

844
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:30,028
Once it executes, it'll wipe out
anything with the machine's code on it.

845
01:32:30,086 --> 01:32:33,531
You do realize this affects every
computer connected to the Internet.

846
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:38,070
So the power grids, the
banks, the stock markets.

847
01:32:38,136 --> 01:32:40,284
Everything goes dark.

848
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:47,542
Welcome. Glad you're here.

849
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:54,331
<i>I think the real problem is how we
get past the machine's defenses.</i>

850
01:32:54,394 --> 01:32:56,137
Why don't we take
out the solar field?

851
01:32:56,196 --> 01:32:59,971
Deprive it of its power and
possibly slow it down.

852
01:33:00,033 --> 01:33:03,433
I don't know. I don't see
how that's gonna work.

853
01:33:03,953 --> 01:33:07,478
He wants to upload me
to him... Its consciousness.

854
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:09,062
Absolutely not.

855
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:11,448
We inject the infected
virus into my system...

856
01:33:11,553 --> 01:33:14,072
and then I go back and
let him upload me.

857
01:33:14,172 --> 01:33:16,866
There's a chance it won't
detect it until it's too late.

858
01:33:16,925 --> 01:33:19,321
As soon as the nanites
enter her bloodstream,

859
01:33:19,322 --> 01:33:23,748
they'll start to alter her cells. So
when the virus takes out the machine...

860
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:25,575
it could kill her too.

861
01:33:25,642 --> 01:33:27,119
I know.

862
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:31,460
I'm the only one he trusts.

863
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:55,734
Hustle up.

864
01:34:45,305 --> 01:34:47,282
You gotta go.

865
01:36:20,066 --> 01:36:21,418
What is that?

866
01:36:21,484 --> 01:36:23,257
Is that him?

867
01:36:23,319 --> 01:36:25,171
Oh, my God.

868
01:36:25,238 --> 01:36:28,763
I don't know what it's done,
but it's not him. It can't be.

869
01:36:55,268 --> 01:36:57,291
I found a way back.

870
01:37:31,387 --> 01:37:34,787
- They're going to attack us.
- I know. You need to leave.

871
01:37:34,849 --> 01:37:36,496
No. I'm not leaving you again.

872
01:37:36,559 --> 01:37:38,252
It's not safe here, Evelyn.

873
01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:47,258
You can protect me.

874
01:37:48,154 --> 01:37:50,006
If you upload me...

875
01:37:52,367 --> 01:37:55,016
you can protect me.

876
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:00,858
Your heart is palpitating.

877
01:38:01,959 --> 01:38:03,902
You're perspiring.

878
01:38:06,422 --> 01:38:08,024
You're terrified of me.

879
01:38:11,803 --> 01:38:15,032
No, I'm afraid that
we'll lose this chance.

880
01:38:18,393 --> 01:38:21,463
This isn't working. He's
not letting her inside.

881
01:38:21,521 --> 01:38:23,870
It's 'cause the machine
doesn't actually love her.

882
01:38:23,932 --> 01:38:25,629
That's all we need.
We're ready to move.

883
01:38:25,691 --> 01:38:28,385
Wait a second. You can't do
that. She's still out there.

884
01:38:28,444 --> 01:38:31,639
The more danger she's in, the more chance
he'll protect her by uploading her.

885
01:38:31,697 --> 01:38:33,891
Joseph.

886
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:35,222
She agreed to this.

887
01:38:35,284 --> 01:38:38,388
Not to this, she didn't. This was
not the plan. Give her a chance.

888
01:38:40,123 --> 01:38:41,645
I'm sorry, Max.

889
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:49,069
Fire.

890
01:38:54,011 --> 01:38:56,159
Will, please upload me.

891
01:38:56,973 --> 01:39:00,498
Why did you lose faith, Evelyn?
Why didn't you believe in me?

892
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:05,581
Fire.

893
01:39:10,236 --> 01:39:11,883
Will!

894
01:39:16,784 --> 01:39:18,602
Fire.

895
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:20,017
Will!

896
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:24,934
She's hit.

897
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:46,126
Fire.

898
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:07,484
Hey.

899
01:40:12,673 --> 01:40:15,322
She's been hit bad. He's
taken her underground.

900
01:41:33,462 --> 01:41:36,315
<i>People fear what they
don't understand.</i>

901
01:41:38,884 --> 01:41:40,907
You want to destroy me?

902
01:41:43,723 --> 01:41:46,542
<i>No, Will, please.</i>

903
01:41:48,686 --> 01:41:51,130
You're destroying them.

904
01:41:55,401 --> 01:41:56,593
No.

905
01:41:57,361 --> 01:41:59,714
I'm trying to save them.

906
01:42:28,309 --> 01:42:29,581
Run.

907
01:42:39,278 --> 01:42:40,630
Joseph, it's okay.

908
01:42:41,113 --> 01:42:43,307
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

909
01:42:46,369 --> 01:42:47,891
Will?

910
01:42:51,749 --> 01:42:53,772
Stop!

911
01:43:00,341 --> 01:43:02,159
Upload the virus now.

912
01:43:02,259 --> 01:43:05,238
He doesn't care if you kill me.
He can't. He's not able to.

913
01:43:05,304 --> 01:43:07,031
Upload the virus.

914
01:43:09,225 --> 01:43:11,293
What is she doing?

915
01:43:12,019 --> 01:43:14,338
She's threatening to kill him.

916
01:43:15,815 --> 01:43:20,842
<i>People fear what they
don't understand.</i>

917
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:24,132
I can heal her body, Max.

918
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:27,643
Or I can upload the virus, but
there's not enough time for both.

919
01:43:28,119 --> 01:43:29,562
There's not enough power.

920
01:43:30,121 --> 01:43:32,315
No, Will, please.

921
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:36,857
Please, listen to me, Will.

922
01:43:43,426 --> 01:43:46,826
He can't die because
of what we've done.

923
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:52,345
I can see everything.

924
01:45:04,632 --> 01:45:05,904
<i>Look at the sky.</i>

925
01:45:08,511 --> 01:45:10,284
<i>The clouds.</i>

926
01:45:12,181 --> 01:45:15,911
<i>We're healing the
ecosystem, not harming it.</i>

927
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:21,799
<i>Particles join the air currents...</i>

928
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:24,673
<i>building themselves
out of pollutants.</i>

929
01:45:26,987 --> 01:45:30,557
<i>Forests can be regrown.</i>

930
01:45:33,035 --> 01:45:38,437
<i>Water so pure you can
drink out of any river.</i>

931
01:45:41,710 --> 01:45:44,108
<i>This is your dream.</i>

932
01:45:45,214 --> 01:45:48,784
Not merely to cure disease,
but to heal the planet.

933
01:45:48,884 --> 01:45:52,238
And build a better
future for all of us.

934
01:46:11,323 --> 01:46:12,925
That's it.

935
01:46:13,409 --> 01:46:15,227
The virus.

936
01:46:21,166 --> 01:46:22,768
Are you okay?

937
01:46:23,335 --> 01:46:24,482
Yeah.

938
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:42,004
He didn't kill anyone.

939
01:47:01,498 --> 01:47:02,975
Will...

940
01:47:05,711 --> 01:47:07,563
It is you.

941
01:47:10,341 --> 01:47:12,364
Always was.

942
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:18,790
I'm sorry I didn't believe.

943
01:47:31,236 --> 01:47:33,009
Think about the garden.

944
01:47:35,366 --> 01:47:38,185
Think about our sanctuary.

945
01:47:47,252 --> 01:47:49,730
<i>I'll never let you go.</i>

946
01:49:24,641 --> 01:49:27,494
<i>The virus took out everything.</i>

947
01:49:40,157 --> 01:49:43,557
<i>A worldwide blackout,
just as they'd said.</i>

948
01:49:48,582 --> 01:49:51,652
<i>But I knew there
was something more.</i>

949
01:49:54,004 --> 01:49:55,822
There had to be.

950
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:11,414
<i>He created this garden for the
same reason he did everything.</i>

951
01:50:19,404 --> 01:50:21,848
<i>So that they could be together.</i>
