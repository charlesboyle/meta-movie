1
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,702
How do you do?

2
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,579
My name is Deems Taylor,

3
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,832
and it's my very pleasant duty
to welcome you here

4
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,960
on behalf of Walt Disney,
Leopold Stokowski

5
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:11,631
and all the other artists and musicians
whose combined talents

6
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:16,093
went into the creation of this
new form of entertainment, Fantasia.

7
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,972
What you're going to see

8
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,642
are the designs
and pictures and stories

9
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,895
that music inspired
in the minds and imaginations

10
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,439
of a group of artists.

11
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:29,982
In other words,
these are not going to be

12
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,860
the interpretations
of trained musicians.

13
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,238
Which I think is all to the good.

14
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,699
Now, there are three kinds of music
on this Fantasia program.

15
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,744
First is the kind that tells
a definite story.

16
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,831
Then there's the kind that,
while it has no specific plot,

17
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:48,501
does paint a series of, more or less,
definite pictures.

18
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,127
Then there's a third kind,

19
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:53,381
music that exists simply
for its own sake.

20
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:56,509
Now, the number that opens
our Fantasia program,

21
00:02:56,593 --> 00:03:00,137
the Toccata and Fugue,
is music of this third kind,

22
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,515
what we call absolute music.

23
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,103
Even the title has no meaning beyond
a description of the form of the music.

24
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:11,941
What you will see on the screen is a
picture of the various abstract images

25
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,026
that might pass through your mind

26
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:17,697
if you sat in a concert hall
listening to this music.

27
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,575
At first you're more or less
conscious of the orchestra.

28
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,911
So our picture opens
with a series of impressions

29
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,872
of the conductor and the players.

30
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:29,834
Then the music begins to suggest
other things to your imagination.

31
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,588
They might be, oh, just masses of color.

32
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:37,091
Or they may be cloud forms
or great landscapes

33
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:42,138
or vague shadows or geometrical objects
floating in space.

34
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,599
So now we present

35
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:48,936
the Toccata and Fugue in D Minor
by Johann Sebastian Bach,

36
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:52,398
interpreted in pictures
by Walt Disney and his associates,

37
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,942
and in music
by the Philadelphia Orchestra

38
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:58,696
and its conductor, Leopold Stokowski.

39
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,660
You know, it's funny how wrong
an artist can be about his own work.

40
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:52,331
Now, the one composition of
Tchaikovsky's that he really detested

41
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,041
was his Nutcracker Suite,

42
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,960
which is probably the most
popular thing he ever wrote.

43
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,214
It's a series of dances
taken out of a full-length ballet

44
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,548
called The Nutcracker

45
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:04,927
that he once composed
for the St. Petersburg opera house.

46
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,430
It wasn't much of a success
and nobody performs it nowadays,

47
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:12,142
but I'm pretty sure you'll recognize the
music of the Suite when you hear it.

48
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:15,812
Incidentally, you won't see
any nutcracker on the screen.

49
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,106
There's nothing left
of him but the title.

50
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:55,108
And now we're going to hear a piece of
music that tells a very definite story.

51
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:57,902
As a matter of fact, in this case,
the story came first

52
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:01,364
and the composer wrote the music
to go with it.

53
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:05,493
It's a very old story,
one that goes back almost 2,000 years.

54
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:09,080
A legend about a sorcerer
who had an apprentice.

55
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,417
He was a bright young lad,
very anxious to learn the business.

56
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:15,086
As a matter of fact,
he was a little bit too bright

57
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,714
because he started practicing
some of the boss's best magic tricks

58
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,509
before learning how to control them.

59
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,929
One day, for instance,
when he'd been told by his master

60
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:29,058
to carry water to fill a cauldron,
he had the brilliant idea

61
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:32,770
of bringing a broomstick to life
to carry the water for him.

62
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:35,606
Well, this worked very well, at first.

63
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:38,943
Unfortunately, however,
having forgotten the magic formula

64
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:42,280
that would make the broomstick
stop carrying the water,

65
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,199
he found he'd started something
he couldn't finish.

66
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,601
Mr. Stokowski. Mr. Stokowski.

67
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,898
My congratulations, sir.

68
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,484
Congratulations to you, Mickey.

69
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:24,403
Gee, thanks.

70
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,740
Well, so long. I'll be seein' ya.

71
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,617
Goodbye.

72
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,005
When Igor Stravinsky wrote his ballet,
The Rite of Spring...

73
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,730
I repeat,

74
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:03,734
when Igor Stravinsky wrote his ballet,
The Rite of Spring,

75
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:07,154
his purpose was, in his own words,
to "express primitive life."

76
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:11,241
And so Walt Disney and his fellow
artists have taken him at his word.

77
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:14,161
Instead of presenting the ballet
in its original form,

78
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:19,041
as a simple series of tribal dances,
they have visualized it as a pageant,

79
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:23,087
as the story of the growth
of life on Earth.

80
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,506
And that story,
as you're going to see it,

81
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,008
isn't the product
of anybody's imagination.

82
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:32,179
It's a coldly accurate reproduction
ofwhat science thinks went on

83
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,557
during the first few billion years
of this planet's existence.

84
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:39,478
Science, not art,
wrote the scenario of this picture.

85
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,523
According to science,
the first living things here

86
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,983
were single-celled organisms,

87
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:49,279
tiny little white or green blobs
of nothing in particular

88
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,698
that lived under the water.

89
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,368
And then, as the ages passed,
the oceans began to swarm

90
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,662
with all kinds of marine creatures.

91
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:59,790
Finally, after about a billion years,

92
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,626
certain fish, more ambitious
than the rest,

93
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,672
crawled up on land and became
the first amphibians.

94
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,883
And then,
several hundred million years ago,

95
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:14,096
nature went off on another tack
and produced the dinosaurs.

96
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,141
Now, the name "dinosaur"
comes from two Greek words

97
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,268
meaning "terrible lizard."

98
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:21,478
And they certainly were all of that.

99
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,772
They came in all shapes and sizes,

100
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:27,484
from little, crawling horrors
about the size of a chicken

101
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:30,737
to hundred-ton nightmares.

102
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,906
They were not very bright.

103
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,784
Even the biggest of them
had only the brain of a pigeon.

104
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:39,329
They lived in the air and water
as well as on land.

105
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,582
As a rule, they were vegetarians,

106
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,334
rather amiable
and easy to get along with.

107
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:48,005
However, there were bullies
and gangsters among them.

108
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:51,508
The worst of the lot,
a brute named tyrannosaurus rex,

109
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:55,387
was probably the meanest killer
that ever roamed the Earth.

110
00:41:56,264 --> 00:42:00,601
The dinosaurs were lords of creation
for about 200 million years.

111
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:04,354
And then... Well,
we don't exactly know what happened.

112
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:08,442
Some scientists think that
great droughts and earthquakes

113
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,862
turned the whole world
into a gigantic dustbowl.

114
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:15,782
In any case,
the dinosaurs were wiped out.

115
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,826
That is where our story ends.

116
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:21,538
Where it begins is at a time
infinitely far back,

117
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:23,707
when there was no life at all on Earth.

118
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,542
Nothing but clouds of steam,

119
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:29,213
boiling seas and exploding volcanoes.

120
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:33,258
So now,
imagine yourselves out in space

121
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,844
billions and billions of years ago,

122
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:39,306
looking down on this lonely,
tormented little planet,

123
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,351
spinning through
an empty sea of nothingness.

124
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,925
And now we'll have
a 15-minute intermission.

125
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,043
Before we get into
the second half of the program,

126
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,587
I'd like to introduce somebody to you,

127
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:56,632
somebody who's very important
to Fantasia.

128
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:59,051
He's very shy and very retiring.

129
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:02,679
I just happened to run across him
one day at the Disney studios.

130
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:04,681
But when I did, I suddenly realized

131
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:08,393
that here was not only an indispensable
member of the organization,

132
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:12,147
but a screen personality whose
possibilities nobody around the place

133
01:09:12,232 --> 01:09:13,524
had ever noticed.

134
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:17,694
And so I'm very happy to have
this opportunity to introduce to you

135
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:19,738
the soundtrack.

136
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,491
All right. Come on.

137
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,952
That's all right. Don't be timid.

138
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:29,456
Atta soundtrack.

139
01:09:29,541 --> 01:09:32,042
Now, watching him, I discovered
that every beautiful sound

140
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:35,045
also creates
an equally beautiful picture.

141
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:38,924
Now, look. Will the soundtrack
kindly produce a sound?

142
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:43,428
Go on, don't be nervous.
Go ahead. Any sound.

143
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:49,643
Well, that isn't quite
what I had in mind.

144
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:53,605
Suppose we hear and see the harp.

145
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:18,005
Now one of the strings, say, the violin.

146
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:43,155
And now... now, one of the woodwinds,
a flute.

147
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:51,079
Very pretty.

148
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:54,291
Now, let's have a brass instrument,
the trumpet.

149
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:16,021
All right. Now, how about
a low instrument, the bassoon?

150
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:30,160
Go on. Go on.
Drop the other shoe, will you?

151
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:39,378
Well, now to finish, suppose we see
some of the percussion instruments,

152
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,505
beginning with the bass drum.

153
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:09,741
Thanks a lot, old man.

154
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:18,709
The symphony that Beethoven
called the Pastoral,

155
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:22,337
his sixth, is one of the few pieces
of music he ever wrote

156
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:24,673
that tells something
like a definite story.

157
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:27,676
He was a great nature lover,
and in this symphony,

158
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,846
he paints a musical picture
of a day in the country.

159
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:32,931
Now, of course,
the country that Beethoven described

160
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:35,684
was the countryside
with which he was familiar.

161
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:38,520
But his music covers
a much wider field than that,

162
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:42,566
so Walt Disney has given the Pastoral
Symphony a mythological setting.

163
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:47,070
And that setting is of Mt. Olympus,
the abode of the gods.

164
01:12:47,155 --> 01:12:50,532
And here, first of all,
we meet a group of fabulous creatures

165
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,451
of the field and forest,

166
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:56,538
unicorns, fauns,
Pegasus, the flying horse,

167
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:59,291
and his entire family,
the centaurs,

168
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:03,795
those strange creatures
that are half-man and half-horse.

169
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,882
And their girlfriends,
the centaur-ettes.

170
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:10,177
Later on, we meet our old friend,
Bacchus, the god ofwine,

171
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:12,387
presiding over a bacchanal.

172
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:14,347
The party is interrupted by a storm.

173
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:17,100
And now, we see Vulcan
forging thunderbolts

174
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:20,145
and handing them over to the
king of all the gods, Zeus,

175
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,397
who plays darts with them.

176
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:26,234
As the storm clears, we see Iris,
the goddess of the rainbow.

177
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:30,155
And Apollo, driving
his sun chariot across the sky.

178
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,199
And then Morpheus, the god of sleep,

179
01:13:32,283 --> 01:13:34,951
covers everything
with his cloak of night,

180
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:37,996
as Diana, using the new moon as a bow,

181
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:42,501
shoots an arrow of fire
that spangles the sky with stars.

182
01:36:12,725 --> 01:36:16,812
Now we're going to do one of the most
famous and popular ballets ever written,

183
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:20,441
The Dance of the Hours
from Ponchielli's opera La Gioconda.

184
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:23,193
It's a pageant of the hours of the day.

185
01:36:23,278 --> 01:36:26,447
We see first a group
of dancers in costumes

186
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:28,824
to suggest the delicate light of dawn.

187
01:36:28,908 --> 01:36:30,367
Then a second group enters

188
01:36:30,452 --> 01:36:33,537
dressed to represent
the brilliant light of noon day.

189
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:36,331
As these withdraw, a third group enters

190
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:40,878
in costumes that suggest
the delicate tones of early evening.

191
01:36:40,962 --> 01:36:45,549
Then a last group, all in black,
the somber hours of the night.

192
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:48,302
Suddenly, the orchestra
bursts into a brilliant finale

193
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:53,140
in which the hours of darkness
are overcome by the hours of light.

194
01:36:53,224 --> 01:36:57,019
All this takes place in the great hall
with its garden beyond,

195
01:36:57,103 --> 01:37:00,772
of the palace of Duke Alvise,
a Venetian nobleman.

196
01:49:23,974 --> 01:49:26,434
The last number on our Fantasia program

197
01:49:26,518 --> 01:49:29,562
is a combination of two pieces
of music so utterly different

198
01:49:29,647 --> 01:49:34,234
in construction and mood
that they set each other off perfectly.

199
01:49:34,318 --> 01:49:36,736
The firstis A Night on Bald Mountain,

200
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:40,907
by one of Russia's greatest composers,
Modest Mussorgsky.

201
01:49:40,991 --> 01:49:45,078
The second is Franz Schubert's
world-famous Ave Maria.

202
01:49:45,162 --> 01:49:47,956
Musically and dramatically,
we have here a picture

203
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:50,583
of the struggle
between the profane and the sacred.

204
01:49:50,668 --> 01:49:53,419
Bald Mountain, according to tradition,

205
01:49:53,504 --> 01:49:56,756
is the gathering place
of Satan and his followers.

206
01:49:56,840 --> 01:50:00,802
Here on Walpurgis Night, which is
the equivalent of our own Halloween,

207
01:50:00,886 --> 01:50:04,722
the creatures of evil gather
to worship their master.

208
01:50:04,807 --> 01:50:07,433
Under his spell, they dance furiously

209
01:50:07,518 --> 01:50:10,311
until the coming of dawn
and the sounds of church bells

210
01:50:10,396 --> 01:50:15,275
send the infernal army slinking back
into their abodes of darkness.

211
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:18,861
And then we hear the Ave Maria,
with its message of the triumph

212
01:50:18,946 --> 01:50:23,032
of hope and life over the powers
of despair and death.
