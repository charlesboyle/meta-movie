1
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,855
I don't really pray...

2
00:00:28,147 --> 00:00:31,066
...but if you could just
help me out here...

3
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,610
...I promise....

4
00:00:35,779 --> 00:00:37,364
105.

5
00:00:38,032 --> 00:00:39,366
105?

6
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,784
Oh, my God!

7
00:00:41,827 --> 00:00:43,496
Run a bath, call the doctor.

8
00:00:43,787 --> 00:00:45,789
Get her into the bath.

9
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,459
Dr. Carter, 655-....

10
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:49,835
He won't be there.

11
00:00:50,336 --> 00:00:51,921
What is a thermometer?
Mercury.

12
00:00:52,796 --> 00:00:55,674
How does it even work?
Maybe I can page him.

13
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:57,927
Susan. Susie.

14
00:00:59,386 --> 00:01:00,679
Mommy says get up now.

15
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:02,681
- Cold.
- I know.

16
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:04,850
Hang on.

17
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:08,229
Cold!

18
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,106
It just feels cold because you're so hot.

19
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:13,609
Susan, stay with me. Susan.

20
00:01:14,735 --> 00:01:15,778
Susan!

21
00:01:19,073 --> 00:01:20,866
Has she been disoriented?
Confused?

22
00:01:21,283 --> 00:01:24,119
She said that she saw
a man in her bedroom.

23
00:01:28,249 --> 00:01:29,166
Are you cold?

24
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:33,420
Okay, swing it.

25
00:01:34,588 --> 00:01:36,382
- Move it, people.
- Is room 2 clear?

26
00:01:36,674 --> 00:01:37,883
Yes, it's clear.

27
00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:39,635
Get her pressure.

28
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:41,929
Let's give her O2. Ten liters.

29
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:44,223
Tap her right away.

30
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:53,649
How's her breathing?

31
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:18,174
No pulse or rhythm.

32
00:02:19,508 --> 00:02:21,177
Are you God?

33
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:23,971
No.

34
00:02:24,388 --> 00:02:25,764
My name is Seth.

35
00:02:26,265 --> 00:02:27,558
Where are we going?

36
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,851
Home.

37
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:31,896
Can Mommy come?

38
00:02:32,438 --> 00:02:33,606
No.

39
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:44,283
She won't understand.

40
00:02:44,783 --> 00:02:45,951
She will...

41
00:02:46,452 --> 00:02:47,786
...someday.

42
00:02:55,753 --> 00:02:57,796
Can I ask you something?

43
00:02:58,255 --> 00:02:59,465
Yes.

44
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:02,009
What did you like best?

45
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:05,262
Pajamas.

46
00:03:31,372 --> 00:03:33,290
She definitely knew what she liked.

47
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,545
- Pajamas?
- Flannel, with feet.

48
00:03:37,962 --> 00:03:39,255
Pajamas.

49
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,550
Excellent choice. What else?

50
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:45,719
In the elevator of
the Bradbury Building...

51
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,348
...a man touched a woman's
bare skin by accident...

52
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:52,935
...but it made her turn
and look at him in such a way....

53
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,063
And they...?

54
00:03:56,522 --> 00:03:57,773
Yes.

55
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:00,609
It was a good day.

56
00:04:01,193 --> 00:04:03,404
Do you ever wonder
what that would be like?

57
00:04:03,988 --> 00:04:04,947
Touch?

58
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:06,949
No.

59
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:09,034
Yes, you do.

60
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:13,372
Occasionally. Yes.

61
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:16,458
Touch.

62
00:04:34,727 --> 00:04:37,605
I'm not asking for it every night.
Just twice a week.

63
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:40,566
Blue eyes.
He's never going to leave her.

64
00:04:40,816 --> 00:04:44,570
20 minutes. 20 minutes. Everything
in this damn city is 20 minutes.

65
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,405
It's never 20 minutes.

66
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,972
My ass on a stool all day.
She always gets the good chair.

67
00:05:13,682 --> 00:05:17,853
Six pounds, four ounces.
My daughter has a daughter.

68
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:32,868
$20,000 at 21 percent.

69
00:05:33,118 --> 00:05:36,080
Pay it off with another card
at 14 percent.

70
00:05:36,455 --> 00:05:37,498
Ah, shit!

71
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:42,169
Federal 595 heavy, slow immediately
to match preceding aircraft. Over.

72
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,380
Jesus, wake up! Wake up!

73
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,148
The little girl asked me
if she could be an angel.

74
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,733
They all want wings.

75
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:06,902
I never know what to say.

76
00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:08,779
Tell them the truth.

77
00:06:09,572 --> 00:06:11,073
Angels aren't human.

78
00:06:11,615 --> 00:06:13,159
We were never human.

79
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:17,496
What if I just make her
a little pair of wings out of paper?

80
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,415
Tell her the truth.

81
00:06:19,957 --> 00:06:21,417
I told her.

82
00:06:23,711 --> 00:06:25,004
How did she take it?

83
00:06:26,046 --> 00:06:30,176
She said, "What good would wings be
if you couldn't feel wind on your face?"

84
00:06:56,202 --> 00:06:59,497
On the 101 through
downtown L.A., no delays....

85
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:02,541
Shit! Jesus!

86
00:08:11,652 --> 00:08:12,778
What do we got?

87
00:08:13,154 --> 00:08:17,366
50-year-old had a huge anterior wall MI
this morning. Collapsed while jogging.

88
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:20,744
Paramedics resuscitated him,
but his EKG's pretty ugly.

89
00:08:21,162 --> 00:08:22,496
He's hypertensive.

90
00:08:22,705 --> 00:08:24,039
This diagonal looks tight.

91
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,333
Who cathed him?

92
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,252
Rosenberg.

93
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,881
- Be right in.
- The patient wants to meet you.

94
00:08:44,143 --> 00:08:46,353
He's pretty out of it.

95
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:50,357
The doctor's here.

96
00:09:14,215 --> 00:09:16,217
We're just going to cool to 32 today.

97
00:09:18,177 --> 00:09:19,053
Sucker.

98
00:09:22,515 --> 00:09:23,557
Jimi.

99
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:40,699
Vein.

100
00:09:55,422 --> 00:09:57,174
Kid started walking.

101
00:09:58,008 --> 00:10:00,135
Three unassisted steps.

102
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:03,305
- Get it on video?
- I wasn't even there.

103
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:06,976
You failed as a father already.
How does that feel?

104
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:12,106
Retrograde on.

105
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:18,529
Come down to half flow,
give me a little volume.

106
00:10:18,863 --> 00:10:20,489
Down to half flow,
here's your volume.

107
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:22,158
- Ready to come off?
- Ready.

108
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:23,367
Let's come off.

109
00:10:23,742 --> 00:10:25,035
We're coming down.

110
00:10:25,286 --> 00:10:28,455
We're clamped and off bypass.

111
00:10:52,688 --> 00:10:53,689
Oh, shit.

112
00:10:55,274 --> 00:10:56,442
What are you missing?

113
00:10:56,692 --> 00:10:57,526
Sponge.

114
00:10:58,986 --> 00:11:00,029
Bummer.

115
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,286
Got it!

116
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,793
Thank you, everybody.

117
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:16,962
Presbyterian's on line 2.

118
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:18,714
His rhythm will be irritable.

119
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,971
- She's getting good, huh?
- Yeah, she's getting that attitude too.

120
00:11:26,305 --> 00:11:27,973
Getting an attitude?

121
00:11:30,392 --> 00:11:31,769
Shit! V-tac!

122
00:11:32,144 --> 00:11:33,479
Christ! Paddles!

123
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:35,731
Kill the music. Get her back.

124
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:38,067
- Charge to 2.
- Charging 200.

125
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,528
Dr. Rice.

126
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:48,369
Clear!

127
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,038
- No pressure.
- You give him lidocaine?

128
00:11:51,205 --> 00:11:52,039
100's gone in.

129
00:11:52,248 --> 00:11:53,624
Buzz him again at 300.

130
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,628
- Still nothing.
- Start compression.

131
00:11:57,795 --> 00:11:58,754
Kill the alarm!

132
00:12:03,676 --> 00:12:05,261
Hold up. It's not working.

133
00:12:05,469 --> 00:12:07,930
Got to open him.
How long to go back on?

134
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:09,640
It'll take me 10 minutes.

135
00:12:10,015 --> 00:12:11,517
Come on! Nothing.

136
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:12,768
Knife.

137
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:23,362
Internal paddles. Charge to 20.

138
00:12:24,113 --> 00:12:24,989
Ready.

139
00:12:25,531 --> 00:12:26,448
Hit it.

140
00:12:28,784 --> 00:12:30,119
Go to 30.

141
00:12:30,995 --> 00:12:31,871
Hit it.

142
00:12:32,246 --> 00:12:33,455
No response.

143
00:12:34,206 --> 00:12:35,916
Tom, I got to get back on bypass here.

144
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,918
Almost there.
Give me 7 more minutes.

145
00:12:38,252 --> 00:12:39,128
Come on.

146
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:43,257
Don't do this.

147
00:12:45,301 --> 00:12:46,177
He's going.

148
00:12:46,886 --> 00:12:47,928
He's not going anywhere.

149
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,065
Come on, don't do this!

150
00:13:02,776 --> 00:13:04,111
Damn it, come on!

151
00:13:06,238 --> 00:13:07,323
Tom!

152
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:10,576
Come on!

153
00:13:33,557 --> 00:13:34,892
Mrs. Balford?

154
00:13:36,143 --> 00:13:37,394
Where's the doctor?

155
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:41,106
- I'm the doctor.
- I'm sorry.

156
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,443
I operated on your husband.

157
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:46,362
How is he?

158
00:13:48,906 --> 00:13:49,949
He didn't survive.

159
00:13:53,494 --> 00:13:54,370
What?

160
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:59,458
We were able to restore
blood flow to the heart...

161
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:02,962
...but he developed a lethal arrhythmia
and we couldn't resuscitate him.

162
00:14:03,337 --> 00:14:06,966
Wait. I'm sorry, I don't understand.
A what?

163
00:14:10,636 --> 00:14:11,679
I'm sorry.

164
00:14:18,102 --> 00:14:19,728
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

165
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:22,022
What did you say?

166
00:14:24,984 --> 00:14:26,235
What?

167
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:28,863
Oh, my God!

168
00:14:58,684 --> 00:15:01,395
On the table, on my table. I'm sorry.

169
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:03,189
I'm sorry.

170
00:15:05,816 --> 00:15:08,027
I'm sorry. What happened?
What happened?

171
00:15:08,277 --> 00:15:10,404
A graft occlusion? What?

172
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:15,075
It was textbook. It was textbook.

173
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:23,250
I'm so sorry.

174
00:15:26,045 --> 00:15:27,796
The room got so big.
I was so small.

175
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:30,090
How did I get so small?

176
00:15:31,008 --> 00:15:32,218
I should've gone back on.

177
00:15:32,593 --> 00:15:34,929
I should've massaged longer.

178
00:15:35,221 --> 00:15:38,307
I should've gone back on.
Massaged longer. I lost it.

179
00:15:40,726 --> 00:15:42,269
I lost it.

180
00:16:01,038 --> 00:16:03,123
Have you ever been seen, Cassiel?

181
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,501
You're looking at me.

182
00:16:06,168 --> 00:16:10,339
No, not by me, and not
by the dying or the delirious.

183
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,758
Have you ever been seen...

184
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,469
...like you were a man?

185
00:16:16,637 --> 00:16:20,975
In a diner once, a blind woman
turned to me all of a sudden...

186
00:16:21,308 --> 00:16:23,185
...and asked me to pass her the mustard.

187
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,481
- But she was blind.
- But she knew I was there.

188
00:16:28,482 --> 00:16:31,610
That doctor in the operating room...

189
00:16:33,445 --> 00:16:35,322
...she looked right at me.

190
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:38,284
She didn't see you, Seth.
She can't see you.

191
00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:40,995
No one can see you
unless you want them to.

192
00:16:41,745 --> 00:16:43,205
And if I want her to?

193
00:16:44,623 --> 00:16:45,791
Why do you want her to?

194
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:49,044
To help her.

195
00:16:49,962 --> 00:16:50,963
Open it!

196
00:16:51,255 --> 00:16:52,631
Open it now!

197
00:16:53,257 --> 00:16:54,508
Everybody down!

198
00:16:56,677 --> 00:16:58,387
Do it! Do it!

199
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,472
Shit! Just give him the money.

200
00:17:00,806 --> 00:17:03,350
Did I leave the lights on?
I left the lights on.

201
00:17:03,684 --> 00:17:05,519
I should have gone to Ralphs.

202
00:17:06,187 --> 00:17:08,564
- Do it!
- Relax. I'm doing it, okay?

203
00:17:09,982 --> 00:17:11,734
I never saw the Grand Canyon.

204
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:13,569
I'll never see my grandkids again.

205
00:17:15,446 --> 00:17:16,864
What am I doing?

206
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,533
Just be cool. Be cool.

207
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:25,289
Be cool, man.

208
00:17:25,998 --> 00:17:27,166
Be cool.

209
00:17:32,296 --> 00:17:33,589
Holy shit!

210
00:17:36,008 --> 00:17:37,551
They don't need to see us.

211
00:17:56,904 --> 00:17:58,405
You're early.

212
00:18:31,522 --> 00:18:32,648
What's going on?

213
00:18:32,982 --> 00:18:34,692
Ferris was looking for you.

214
00:18:47,037 --> 00:18:48,539
Don't I have a mitral valve to do?

215
00:18:48,747 --> 00:18:50,374
They canceled it.

216
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:52,001
Who canceled it?

217
00:18:52,168 --> 00:18:53,085
Sheffield.

218
00:18:53,544 --> 00:18:54,795
Why are you telling me?

219
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:56,005
He was busy.

220
00:18:56,213 --> 00:18:57,548
He was chickenshit.

221
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,717
- Maggie, you're sick.
- I'm not sick.

222
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:01,552
You're sick.
You can't operate.

223
00:19:01,844 --> 00:19:04,471
They've rescheduled for Monday.
An elective valve, no big deal.

224
00:19:04,763 --> 00:19:08,058
It is unprofessional, and it
embarrasses me in front of my staff.

225
00:19:12,605 --> 00:19:14,398
I saw the chart on Balford.

226
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,735
I'm on the committee.
It's on review.

227
00:19:18,444 --> 00:19:20,404
- It wasn't your fault.
- I know.

228
00:19:20,654 --> 00:19:22,031
Then what's the problem?

229
00:19:26,285 --> 00:19:27,578
I don't know.

230
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:30,789
You put up a terrific fight.

231
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:35,836
We fight for people's lives, right?

232
00:19:38,672 --> 00:19:41,175
Don't you ever wonder who
it is we're fighting with?

233
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:47,348
So I'm crazy and chemically imbalanced.

234
00:19:47,598 --> 00:19:49,183
You're tired.

235
00:19:50,351 --> 00:19:51,852
You have moments.

236
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:54,897
Why didn't you call me?

237
00:19:57,691 --> 00:19:59,693
Because I never sleep
when you stay over.

238
00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:01,904
You never sleep whether
I stay over or not.

239
00:20:04,156 --> 00:20:05,324
You're good.

240
00:20:05,658 --> 00:20:06,909
You know it.

241
00:20:07,368 --> 00:20:09,495
Come back Monday
and get back on the horse.

242
00:20:11,247 --> 00:20:12,122
Doctor?

243
00:20:18,671 --> 00:20:19,755
I'll see you.

244
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:47,908
"As I walk along the stony shore
of the pond in my shirtsleeves.... "

245
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,828
"...Amazon basin in the north,
once an island sea.... "

246
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,747
"The highest truth on the
subject remains unsaid...

247
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:55,875
...probably cannot be said.

248
00:20:56,125 --> 00:21:00,254
For all that we say is the far-off
remembering of the intuition... "

249
00:21:00,713 --> 00:21:04,300
"...she begins to pull away from
the awareness she had once.... "

250
00:21:09,597 --> 00:21:11,056
"Commencing search. "
Searching my soul.

251
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:14,226
What happened to the cards?
You could touch the cards.

252
00:21:14,602 --> 00:21:16,729
She's been looking
at me for half an hour.

253
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:18,397
Maybe if I just hang here....

254
00:21:18,772 --> 00:21:22,735
"This is a delicious evening,
when the whole body's one sense.... "

255
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:26,655
What if I screamed?
What if I just screamed right now?

256
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:30,951
"When a woman decides to sleep
with a man.... "

257
00:21:32,828 --> 00:21:35,581
"You knew there would always
be a spring...

258
00:21:35,873 --> 00:21:40,294
...as you knew the river
would flow again after it was frozen.

259
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:44,298
When the cold rains kept on
and killed the spring...

260
00:21:44,673 --> 00:21:49,178
...it was as though a young person
had died for no reason. "

261
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:28,050
All right, they have rescheduled
the operation for Monday.

262
00:22:28,342 --> 00:22:29,468
What happened yesterday?

263
00:22:29,844 --> 00:22:31,428
They had a golf tournament.

264
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,180
Who knows with these people?

265
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,640
Good morning, Mr. Messinger.

266
00:22:35,015 --> 00:22:37,518
The "G" is soft, like "messenger".

267
00:22:40,104 --> 00:22:41,230
What's on your lip?

268
00:22:41,647 --> 00:22:43,983
What? Am I slobbering here?

269
00:22:49,155 --> 00:22:51,740
- Where did you get that?
- What am l, a prisoner?

270
00:22:52,032 --> 00:22:54,827
You want to get well, or
you want Ben & Jerry's?

271
00:22:55,202 --> 00:22:56,620
This operation is a big deal.

272
00:22:57,371 --> 00:22:58,789
Continue to eat like this...

273
00:22:59,748 --> 00:23:02,042
...and you might as well skip it.
Save the 30 grand.

274
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:06,380
If you'd have performed the operation
yesterday like you were supposed to...

275
00:23:06,714 --> 00:23:10,092
...I'd be sucking carrots through
a straw in my arm. What happened?

276
00:23:10,843 --> 00:23:13,304
Circumstances were not optimal
for the procedure.

277
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,892
I ain't "the procedure". My name is
Nathan Messinger and I'm right here.

278
00:24:42,685 --> 00:24:45,146
Hello, hello, hello....

279
00:24:47,857 --> 00:24:50,651
Floating, floating. Don't pop it.
Don't pop it!

280
00:24:53,237 --> 00:24:56,282
Do you know the Muffin Man,
the Muffin Man, the Muffin Man?

281
00:25:42,036 --> 00:25:42,870
Hi, Anne.

282
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,580
What are you doing here?

283
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:46,874
I was on my way up to x-ray...

284
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:49,335
...and I thought I'd stop in and just...

285
00:25:50,503 --> 00:25:51,504
...hide.

286
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:53,547
From what?

287
00:25:55,758 --> 00:25:57,301
I should've gone into pediatrics.

288
00:25:57,676 --> 00:25:58,594
Oh, no.

289
00:25:58,969 --> 00:26:01,597
Every guy you meet
is either married or a gyno.

290
00:26:01,847 --> 00:26:04,767
Never date a man who knows more
about your vagina than you do.

291
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,605
Poor little guy.

292
00:26:13,984 --> 00:26:15,820
He never stops crying.

293
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,280
- What's wrong with him?
- No insurance.

294
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,910
Found him in a dumpster
behind the House of Pies.

295
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:25,162
We worked him up the wazoo
for everything...

296
00:26:25,412 --> 00:26:28,374
...from drug exposure to diabetes.
We got nothing.

297
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:30,709
May I?

298
00:26:43,722 --> 00:26:45,015
Did you do an ultrasound?

299
00:26:45,266 --> 00:26:47,101
- You hear a murmur?
- Worth a shot.

300
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,146
Okay, baby.

301
00:26:53,357 --> 00:26:56,110
So what are you hiding from?

302
00:26:58,154 --> 00:26:59,947
My patient's wife.

303
00:27:00,948 --> 00:27:03,951
She wants me to tell her that her
husband is going to be okay...

304
00:27:04,285 --> 00:27:06,912
...and that I have every confidence...

305
00:27:07,746 --> 00:27:08,914
...and I don't.

306
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:12,251
And after all this time,
and after all this work...

307
00:27:12,501 --> 00:27:14,920
...I suddenly have this feeling that...

308
00:27:16,422 --> 00:27:18,966
...none of this is in my hands.
Nothing.

309
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:21,594
And if it isn't...

310
00:27:21,844 --> 00:27:23,470
...what do I do with that?

311
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,073
Excuse me.

312
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,499
Are you a visitor?

313
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:36,210
Yes.

314
00:28:37,378 --> 00:28:40,047
Visiting hours have been
over since 8:00.

315
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:42,550
Why do they have that?

316
00:28:43,092 --> 00:28:43,968
What?

317
00:28:44,176 --> 00:28:45,344
Hours.

318
00:28:46,512 --> 00:28:49,014
Doesn't it help the patient
to be visited?

319
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:53,352
Who are you visiting?
Mr. Messinger?

320
00:28:53,602 --> 00:28:54,812
Right now?

321
00:28:59,066 --> 00:29:00,025
You.

322
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,656
I don't need a visitor.

323
00:29:05,906 --> 00:29:07,074
You're not ill?

324
00:29:07,324 --> 00:29:08,284
No.

325
00:29:10,286 --> 00:29:12,329
I'm one of the doctors here.

326
00:29:15,124 --> 00:29:16,667
Are you in despair?

327
00:29:21,297 --> 00:29:23,132
I lost a patient.

328
00:29:23,924 --> 00:29:25,843
You did everything you could?

329
00:29:27,261 --> 00:29:29,930
I was holding his heart
in my hand when he died.

330
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,766
Then he wasn't alone.

331
00:29:33,184 --> 00:29:34,393
Yes, he was.

332
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:35,769
People die.

333
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,104
Not on my table.

334
00:29:37,354 --> 00:29:39,857
People die when their bodies give out.

335
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:43,652
It's my job to keep their bodies from
giving out. Or what am I doing here?

336
00:29:43,903 --> 00:29:45,779
It wasn't your fault, Maggie.

337
00:29:46,071 --> 00:29:47,573
I wanted him to live.

338
00:29:47,823 --> 00:29:49,241
He is living.

339
00:29:49,825 --> 00:29:51,827
Just not the way you think.

340
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,545
I don't believe in that.

341
00:30:01,795 --> 00:30:04,924
Some things are true
whether you believe in them or not.

342
00:30:06,634 --> 00:30:08,219
How did you know my name?

343
00:30:12,515 --> 00:30:13,808
What's yours?

344
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,019
Seth.

345
00:30:25,486 --> 00:30:27,279
You better get out of here, Seth...

346
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,241
...or security's going to think
you're a psych patient.

347
00:31:42,605 --> 00:31:44,815
- Where are we?
- Down a liter.

348
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:47,276
Suction.

349
00:31:48,235 --> 00:31:53,365
I am stuck on Band-Aid brand
'Cause Band-Aid's stuck on me

350
00:31:59,288 --> 00:32:03,834
No dying now, Mr. Messinger. Not until
you give me Seth's phone number.

351
00:32:05,252 --> 00:32:10,007
I am stuck on Band-Aid brand
'Cause Band-Aid's stuck on me

352
00:32:37,743 --> 00:32:39,411
Those eyes.

353
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,122
The way he looked...

354
00:32:42,623 --> 00:32:44,708
...right down into me.

355
00:32:46,752 --> 00:32:48,087
Seth.

356
00:32:49,547 --> 00:32:51,882
What kind of name is Seth?

357
00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:55,089
I thought you'd be here.

358
00:34:56,423 --> 00:34:57,550
Salty.

359
00:34:58,008 --> 00:35:00,511
My transplant tanked at 2 a.m.

360
00:35:02,054 --> 00:35:03,305
You okay?

361
00:35:10,271 --> 00:35:12,148
You might want to return this.

362
00:35:16,277 --> 00:35:20,030
That part about the spring?
"You knew there'd always be a spring".

363
00:35:20,823 --> 00:35:22,575
How did you know that...?

364
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:24,994
What? I didn't give you this book.

365
00:35:29,165 --> 00:35:30,124
You didn't?

366
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:31,876
Where'd you get it?

367
00:35:43,846 --> 00:35:47,099
Hi. I'm a physician, and I think
a patient left that in my office.

368
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:50,352
- Can you tell me who checked it out?
- I can't tell you who.

369
00:35:50,603 --> 00:35:52,563
I can tell you when.

370
00:35:54,106 --> 00:35:55,733
All right, give me 5 minutes.

371
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,099
Hello, Maggie.

372
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:33,312
It's nice to see you again.

373
00:36:33,729 --> 00:36:35,439
It's weird to see you again.

374
00:36:36,148 --> 00:36:37,525
Weird is nice.

375
00:36:41,403 --> 00:36:42,530
You like Hemingway?

376
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,866
Yeah, I'm starting to.

377
00:36:51,747 --> 00:36:52,665
May I?

378
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:58,504
"As I ate the oysters with their
strong taste of the sea...

379
00:36:58,879 --> 00:37:01,006
...and their faint metallic taste...

380
00:37:01,549 --> 00:37:03,884
...as I drank their cold liquid
from each shell...

381
00:37:04,135 --> 00:37:07,012
...and washed it down
with the crisp taste of the wine...

382
00:37:07,346 --> 00:37:09,181
...I lost the empty feeling...

383
00:37:09,557 --> 00:37:11,517
...and began to be happy".

384
00:37:12,351 --> 00:37:14,854
He never forgets to describe
how things taste.

385
00:37:16,355 --> 00:37:17,690
I like that.

386
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:22,319
Do you come here a lot?

387
00:37:22,987 --> 00:37:24,280
I live here.

388
00:37:25,823 --> 00:37:27,324
What do you do?

389
00:37:27,616 --> 00:37:28,576
Read.

390
00:37:28,826 --> 00:37:31,120
No, I mean, your work.

391
00:37:32,454 --> 00:37:33,831
I'm a messenger.

392
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,085
What kind of messenger?
A bike messenger?

393
00:37:38,544 --> 00:37:40,963
No, I'm a messenger of God.

394
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,300
Got a message for me?

395
00:37:45,384 --> 00:37:46,886
I already gave it to you.

396
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:51,182
Did you use my pager? I usually don't
get my messages unless you beep me.

397
00:37:52,308 --> 00:37:55,603
You've definitely been beeped.

398
00:37:57,855 --> 00:37:59,982
- How is Messinger?
- He's good.

399
00:38:00,316 --> 00:38:02,109
The operation went really well.

400
00:38:02,651 --> 00:38:04,820
- It was a good day.
- It was.

401
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,406
Yeah, I didn't kill anybody today.

402
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:10,743
- You're an excellent doctor.
- How do you know?

403
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,786
I have a feeling.

404
00:38:13,162 --> 00:38:15,331
That's pretty flimsy evidence.

405
00:38:16,248 --> 00:38:17,333
Close your eyes.

406
00:38:20,252 --> 00:38:21,712
It's just for a moment.

407
00:38:41,941 --> 00:38:43,442
What am I doing?

408
00:38:45,653 --> 00:38:47,905
You're touching me.

409
00:38:48,906 --> 00:38:50,324
Touch.

410
00:38:51,909 --> 00:38:53,202
How do you know?

411
00:38:54,745 --> 00:38:56,413
Because I feel it.

412
00:39:05,214 --> 00:39:06,841
You should trust that.

413
00:39:07,591 --> 00:39:09,385
You don't trust it enough.

414
00:39:22,064 --> 00:39:24,275
- Let's go somewhere.
- Where?

415
00:39:24,817 --> 00:39:25,776
I don't care.

416
00:39:26,986 --> 00:39:28,279
What do you want to do?

417
00:39:29,071 --> 00:39:30,614
Anything.

418
00:40:16,118 --> 00:40:17,745
What's that like?

419
00:40:20,539 --> 00:40:22,208
What's it taste like?

420
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:24,335
Describe it. Like Hemingway.

421
00:40:26,545 --> 00:40:28,547
Well, it tastes like...

422
00:40:29,548 --> 00:40:30,799
...a pear.

423
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,719
You don't know what a pear tastes like?

424
00:40:34,428 --> 00:40:37,056
I don't know what a pear
tastes like to you.

425
00:40:43,312 --> 00:40:44,688
Sweet...

426
00:40:45,064 --> 00:40:46,398
...juicy.

427
00:40:47,983 --> 00:40:50,861
Soft on your tongue.
Grainy...

428
00:40:51,237 --> 00:40:54,114
...like sugary sand that
dissolves in your mouth.

429
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,203
How's that?

430
00:41:02,456 --> 00:41:03,916
It's perfect.

431
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:25,896
The first time I looked in a microscope,
I knew I wanted to be a doctor.

432
00:41:29,275 --> 00:41:31,193
Okay, let me have your hand.

433
00:41:31,819 --> 00:41:32,987
What for?

434
00:41:33,279 --> 00:41:35,030
We'll take a look at your blood.

435
00:41:36,073 --> 00:41:37,825
Not a possibility.

436
00:41:41,203 --> 00:41:42,371
Men.

437
00:41:42,621 --> 00:41:44,957
I suppose you know a woman's
threshold of pain...

438
00:41:45,207 --> 00:41:47,126
...is 9 times higher than a man's.

439
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,680
Take a look at that.

440
00:42:03,392 --> 00:42:05,478
That's bright.

441
00:42:10,649 --> 00:42:11,984
That's me.

442
00:42:12,985 --> 00:42:14,236
All those cells.

443
00:42:15,654 --> 00:42:17,406
That's all you are.

444
00:42:19,658 --> 00:42:21,994
That and all the space in between.

445
00:42:23,245 --> 00:42:25,331
If this is all you are...

446
00:42:25,581 --> 00:42:27,333
...these cells...

447
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,503
...then when they die, that's the end.

448
00:42:31,795 --> 00:42:33,589
I don't know. I think so.

449
00:42:35,591 --> 00:42:37,343
How do you explain it?

450
00:42:37,593 --> 00:42:38,594
What?

451
00:42:40,304 --> 00:42:42,473
The enduring myth of Heaven.

452
00:42:47,561 --> 00:42:49,939
I used to think that I had it
all figured out.

453
00:42:50,189 --> 00:42:51,315
But you didn't?

454
00:42:51,732 --> 00:42:52,817
No.

455
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:02,201
Because something happened
in my O.R. and I got...

456
00:43:02,701 --> 00:43:06,205
...this jolt. I got this feeling
that there's something...

457
00:43:06,664 --> 00:43:10,209
...bigger out there. Something bigger
than me, bigger than you, and it....

458
00:43:11,836 --> 00:43:13,546
Does that sound crazy?

459
00:43:14,296 --> 00:43:15,381
No.

460
00:43:16,757 --> 00:43:19,468
I couldn't fix him.
I did everything right...

461
00:43:19,718 --> 00:43:21,470
...and I couldn't fix him.

462
00:43:22,638 --> 00:43:24,431
That's not supposed to happen.

463
00:43:27,184 --> 00:43:28,602
And I...

464
00:43:29,145 --> 00:43:30,521
You cried.

465
00:43:33,774 --> 00:43:34,859
Yeah.

466
00:43:36,986 --> 00:43:40,072
- Why do people cry?
- What do you mean?

467
00:43:40,781 --> 00:43:43,284
I mean, what happens physically?

468
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:50,666
Tear ducts operate on a normal basis
to lubricate and protect the eye.

469
00:43:50,916 --> 00:43:54,211
When you have an emotion,
they overact and create tears.

470
00:43:54,461 --> 00:43:56,463
Why? Why do they overact?

471
00:43:59,258 --> 00:44:00,634
I don't know.

472
00:44:03,387 --> 00:44:05,389
Maybe emotion becomes so intense...

473
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:07,516
...your body just can't contain it.

474
00:44:07,766 --> 00:44:11,437
Your mind and your feelings
become too powerful.

475
00:44:11,687 --> 00:44:13,439
Your body weeps.

476
00:44:19,653 --> 00:44:20,738
I have to go.

477
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:23,032
I got to go. Stay right here.

478
00:44:23,574 --> 00:44:24,867
Don't go anywhere.

479
00:44:25,367 --> 00:44:26,869
Stay right there.

480
00:44:47,932 --> 00:44:49,391
- Get the tube out.
- He can't breathe.

481
00:44:49,683 --> 00:44:51,519
It's because the tube is blocked.

482
00:45:03,656 --> 00:45:05,074
How you feeling?

483
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,284
Ready to hit the waves.

484
00:45:07,535 --> 00:45:10,162
I'm afraid your bodysurfing
days are over.

485
00:45:12,748 --> 00:45:16,794
You got a mean tattoo going there.
What does your wife think of that?

486
00:45:18,003 --> 00:45:19,839
That is my wife.

487
00:45:28,931 --> 00:45:31,183
Check his vitals every 15.

488
00:45:48,367 --> 00:45:50,161
I can't see you,
but I know you're there.

489
00:45:58,043 --> 00:46:00,171
Go back and tell them
that I'm not going.

490
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,299
Not yet.

491
00:46:32,286 --> 00:46:33,704
Where have you been?

492
00:46:34,288 --> 00:46:36,749
Oh, shit. I totally forgot dinner.

493
00:46:37,082 --> 00:46:38,375
Dinner?

494
00:46:38,834 --> 00:46:40,002
With who?

495
00:46:43,923 --> 00:46:46,801
A guy I met. I bumped into him
and we got something to eat.

496
00:46:47,051 --> 00:46:48,636
Did you pack my backpack?

497
00:46:49,512 --> 00:46:50,846
What else?

498
00:46:52,139 --> 00:46:53,390
We talked...

499
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:55,810
...and then I got beeped
and he disappeared.

500
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,353
Why did you pack my backpack?

501
00:46:57,853 --> 00:46:59,563
Earl, what are you doing?

502
00:46:59,814 --> 00:47:02,483
I thought we'd fly up to Tahoe,
use your uncle's cabin...

503
00:47:02,775 --> 00:47:04,068
...maybe do a little hiking.

504
00:47:05,694 --> 00:47:06,695
What?

505
00:47:09,615 --> 00:47:11,492
God. Is it...?

506
00:47:11,826 --> 00:47:13,035
Maggie, it's just a tick.

507
00:47:13,536 --> 00:47:16,413
- Get a match.
- We're not going to burn him, Jordan.

508
00:47:16,664 --> 00:47:18,582
It'll have to back out.
Can't leave the head in.

509
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:21,961
- We can't just be burning tick heads.
- Then get some alcohol.

510
00:47:22,211 --> 00:47:23,087
I don't have any.

511
00:47:23,337 --> 00:47:25,589
- You don't have any alcohol?
- I don't operate here.

512
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,341
How about some olive oil?

513
00:47:30,094 --> 00:47:31,679
Which kind? Jalapeno or rosemary?

514
00:47:32,555 --> 00:47:33,973
Rosemary.

515
00:47:35,224 --> 00:47:38,894
So what did you and your friend...
What did you say his name was?

516
00:47:40,646 --> 00:47:41,647
Seth.

517
00:47:41,897 --> 00:47:43,774
What did you two talk about?

518
00:47:45,484 --> 00:47:46,694
Dying.

519
00:47:49,155 --> 00:47:52,825
Come on, we deal with life and death
every day. Why can't we talk about it?

520
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:56,120
I hope you won't become a
surgeon who prays in the O.R.

521
00:48:04,795 --> 00:48:06,130
Can we talk for a minute?

522
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,715
We'll talk while camping.

523
00:48:07,965 --> 00:48:10,342
Jordan, I can't go camping now.

524
00:48:10,593 --> 00:48:12,303
We need some time together.

525
00:48:13,387 --> 00:48:16,098
All right, let's see if we can
just spend 5 minutes.

526
00:48:16,348 --> 00:48:19,560
Let's see if we can just stand
still together for 5 minutes.

527
00:48:20,436 --> 00:48:21,353
Doing what?

528
00:48:21,812 --> 00:48:23,606
Just being here.

529
00:48:25,024 --> 00:48:26,734
I'll get the trail map.

530
00:48:27,276 --> 00:48:28,360
No, I mean it.

531
00:48:28,861 --> 00:48:30,154
Nothing but us.

532
00:48:33,616 --> 00:48:34,909
What do I do?

533
00:48:36,368 --> 00:48:37,745
Just look at me.

534
00:48:49,882 --> 00:48:50,966
You can't do it.

535
00:48:52,927 --> 00:48:54,595
You can't do it.

536
00:48:54,845 --> 00:48:57,473
- You flinched. You lose!
- You cheat.

537
00:49:11,946 --> 00:49:15,074
That old black magic called...

538
00:49:15,324 --> 00:49:17,076
...love.

539
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,286
Thank you very much.

540
00:49:19,537 --> 00:49:23,207
Welcome back. We've been talking
to mothers who are members of the KKK.

541
00:49:25,501 --> 00:49:27,169
You want to watch anything?

542
00:49:30,881 --> 00:49:32,258
Me neither.

543
00:49:40,724 --> 00:49:42,643
How do you know when I'm here?

544
00:49:48,357 --> 00:49:49,650
I know.

545
00:49:51,861 --> 00:49:53,445
Jeez, you look good.

546
00:49:54,613 --> 00:49:57,992
I forgot how good everybody looked.

547
00:50:00,619 --> 00:50:02,705
30 years of silence.

548
00:50:02,955 --> 00:50:06,709
You got guts, kid, showing yourself
like that. I appreciate that. I do.

549
00:50:06,959 --> 00:50:08,294
It'll make it easier.

550
00:50:09,712 --> 00:50:12,006
I got to tell you, I feel fine.

551
00:50:12,256 --> 00:50:13,841
You might want to check your orders...

552
00:50:14,091 --> 00:50:16,135
...because I sure don't feel
like I'm dying.

553
00:50:16,385 --> 00:50:17,595
You're not dying.

554
00:50:17,845 --> 00:50:21,348
Right. Then how come you're
hanging around my room all the time?

555
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,893
I'm the only one with his ass
hanging out of his dress.

556
00:50:25,394 --> 00:50:26,896
Unless....

557
00:50:30,399 --> 00:50:32,067
Could it be...

558
00:50:33,152 --> 00:50:34,361
...the doctor?

559
00:50:35,988 --> 00:50:37,364
Sure.

560
00:50:37,615 --> 00:50:39,158
The doctor.

561
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,744
She's pretty.

562
00:50:41,994 --> 00:50:43,579
A little flat-chested...

563
00:50:43,829 --> 00:50:45,581
...but all you need's a handful.

564
00:50:45,873 --> 00:50:47,958
- Who are you?
- This is good.

565
00:50:48,417 --> 00:50:50,544
This is what they call...

566
00:50:50,794 --> 00:50:52,963
..."serendipitous".

567
00:50:53,214 --> 00:50:56,592
Look that up in the dictionary,
you'll see a picture of you and me.

568
00:50:56,884 --> 00:50:58,093
Thank you.

569
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,852
You ready to deal?

570
00:51:07,353 --> 00:51:10,147
Because I can answer all
your questions, friend.

571
00:51:20,115 --> 00:51:21,200
How's the French toast?

572
00:51:21,951 --> 00:51:22,910
Fabulous.

573
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,286
Set me up.

574
00:51:32,878 --> 00:51:34,880
Guess I should introduce myself.

575
00:51:35,631 --> 00:51:37,133
Come on, give me your hand.

576
00:51:38,926 --> 00:51:41,220
Put it in mine. There you go.

577
00:51:41,512 --> 00:51:43,514
A little tighter. Tighter.
There you go.

578
00:51:43,764 --> 00:51:45,182
No, that's too much.

579
00:51:45,516 --> 00:51:47,685
There you go. Good grip.

580
00:51:48,769 --> 00:51:50,187
Nathaniel Messinger.

581
00:51:50,437 --> 00:51:52,231
Glutton, hedonist...

582
00:51:52,481 --> 00:51:56,819
...former celestial body,
recent addition to the human race.

583
00:52:00,698 --> 00:52:02,366
I don't believe you.

584
00:52:02,616 --> 00:52:03,909
You want proof?

585
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:06,245
You hang out at a library.

586
00:52:06,495 --> 00:52:08,164
You can speak every language.

587
00:52:08,497 --> 00:52:10,457
You travel with the speed of thought...

588
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:12,626
...and you're reading
my mind right now.

589
00:52:13,127 --> 00:52:14,044
Stop that.

590
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,546
You're doing it.

591
00:52:17,298 --> 00:52:18,424
It's impossible.

592
00:52:18,799 --> 00:52:21,927
"Some things are true
whether you believe them or not".

593
00:52:24,472 --> 00:52:25,639
How?

594
00:52:26,348 --> 00:52:27,641
- You choose.
- Choose?

595
00:52:27,892 --> 00:52:29,518
To fall to Earth.

596
00:52:29,768 --> 00:52:32,730
You take the plunge,
the tumble, the dive.

597
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:35,024
You jump off a bridge.
Leap out a window.

598
00:52:35,274 --> 00:52:38,110
You just make up your mind
to do it and you do it.

599
00:52:41,322 --> 00:52:44,408
You wake up all smelly,
and aching from head to toe...

600
00:52:44,658 --> 00:52:46,410
...and hungrier than you've
ever been...

601
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:50,206
...only you have no idea what hunger is
or any of that stuff...

602
00:52:50,456 --> 00:52:54,460
...so it's all real confusing
and painful, but very, very good.

603
00:52:57,171 --> 00:52:58,506
Human.

604
00:53:00,424 --> 00:53:01,592
Listen, kid:

605
00:53:03,052 --> 00:53:06,138
He gave these bozos
the greatest gift in the universe.

606
00:53:06,388 --> 00:53:08,516
You think He didn't give it to us too?

607
00:53:08,849 --> 00:53:09,725
Which gift?

608
00:53:10,434 --> 00:53:12,061
Free will, brother.

609
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:14,814
Free will.

610
00:53:42,424 --> 00:53:44,009
Couldn't get a job.

611
00:53:44,552 --> 00:53:46,428
No past, no training.

612
00:53:46,679 --> 00:53:48,180
No I.D.

613
00:53:48,722 --> 00:53:52,351
Then one day, I was walking
past a building site.

614
00:53:52,601 --> 00:53:54,019
A skyscraper.

615
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:56,897
And I thought, "I could do that".

616
00:53:57,148 --> 00:53:59,066
You see, these people down here...

617
00:53:59,316 --> 00:54:02,361
...a lot of them are afraid of heights,
you know what I'm saying?

618
00:54:02,611 --> 00:54:05,823
That makes me uniquely qualified.

619
00:54:06,407 --> 00:54:10,161
And besides, it feels like
a little bit of home up here.

620
00:54:10,411 --> 00:54:11,704
And I like what I do.

621
00:54:11,996 --> 00:54:13,122
I'm good at it.

622
00:54:15,749 --> 00:54:17,960
These things'll kill you.

623
00:54:19,753 --> 00:54:21,046
Are there others?

624
00:54:21,797 --> 00:54:23,382
Others like you?

625
00:54:23,757 --> 00:54:25,259
Yeah, they're out there.

626
00:54:25,718 --> 00:54:29,638
You see them, but most of the time
you just walk on by.

627
00:54:30,055 --> 00:54:33,767
Nobody likes to think of the old life.
You know, what they gave up.

628
00:54:34,435 --> 00:54:36,020
Then why'd you do it?

629
00:54:45,488 --> 00:54:47,114
My daughter, Ruth...

630
00:54:47,364 --> 00:54:49,200
...her stupid husband, Frank...

631
00:54:49,825 --> 00:54:51,285
...and my grandkids.

632
00:54:51,535 --> 00:54:53,954
Petie's 4, Hannah's 6.

633
00:54:57,374 --> 00:54:59,960
And this is my wife, Teresa.

634
00:55:03,297 --> 00:55:04,632
Did you...

635
00:55:05,591 --> 00:55:07,218
...tell her who you were?

636
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,846
I started to try once or twice.

637
00:55:11,263 --> 00:55:13,182
Then I thought, "Why do that to her?"

638
00:55:13,432 --> 00:55:14,725
Do what?

639
00:55:15,309 --> 00:55:17,102
It's too much for them.

640
00:55:18,395 --> 00:55:20,773
People don't believe in us anymore.

641
00:55:30,324 --> 00:55:32,576
Do they still gather together
at sunrise?

642
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,037
And sunset, yes.

643
00:55:36,372 --> 00:55:37,873
Take me there?

644
00:55:49,301 --> 00:55:50,928
Can you hear it?

645
00:56:01,772 --> 00:56:02,815
No.

646
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:23,377
I can't hear that!

647
00:56:23,627 --> 00:56:26,005
But you can't feel this!

648
00:56:26,505 --> 00:56:27,840
Nathan!

649
00:56:35,014 --> 00:56:36,307
You have to go back.

650
00:56:36,557 --> 00:56:38,684
Not until I catch the big wave.

651
00:56:43,022 --> 00:56:44,190
Wait.

652
00:56:44,857 --> 00:56:45,983
Wait.

653
00:56:46,233 --> 00:56:47,693
Wait for what?

654
00:56:48,861 --> 00:56:49,987
Swim!

655
00:57:25,773 --> 00:57:27,775
And then you just...

656
00:57:28,234 --> 00:57:29,360
...fall.

657
00:57:29,944 --> 00:57:31,487
- Fall?
- Dive.

658
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:34,573
You make up your mind to do it...

659
00:57:35,574 --> 00:57:37,076
...and you do it.

660
00:57:37,576 --> 00:57:39,870
And when you wake up, you're...?

661
00:57:40,538 --> 00:57:41,914
Yes.

662
00:57:44,208 --> 00:57:46,085
To smell the air.

663
00:57:46,627 --> 00:57:48,045
Taste water.

664
00:57:48,295 --> 00:57:49,380
Read a newspaper.

665
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:50,381
To lie.

666
00:57:50,673 --> 00:57:52,133
Through your teeth.

667
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:53,759
To feed the dog.

668
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,055
Touch her hair.

669
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:02,143
What are you waiting for?

670
00:58:07,731 --> 00:58:10,276
There is so much beauty up here.

671
00:58:12,111 --> 00:58:13,404
Yes.

672
00:58:38,512 --> 00:58:39,722
Here you are again.

673
00:58:41,307 --> 00:58:43,142
We'll release your friend
Messinger tomorrow.

674
00:58:43,434 --> 00:58:44,602
That's good.

675
00:58:44,852 --> 00:58:48,230
His family's having a kind
of a welcome-home party.

676
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:52,818
Will you be going?

677
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,820
Will you be going?

678
00:58:57,656 --> 00:58:58,616
This is Earl.

679
00:58:58,908 --> 00:59:00,201
He told me.

680
00:59:01,327 --> 00:59:02,536
What else does he tell you?

681
00:59:02,786 --> 00:59:06,749
He worries that you never sleep.
And he loves to see you smile.

682
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,544
Sometimes I think Earl's the
only one who understands me.

683
00:59:10,795 --> 00:59:11,879
What about your boyfriend?

684
00:59:12,463 --> 00:59:13,798
Do you love him?

685
00:59:16,801 --> 00:59:18,135
Love? I don't know.

686
00:59:18,385 --> 00:59:19,720
What does that mean?

687
00:59:20,638 --> 00:59:22,723
I was hoping you could tell me.

688
00:59:23,682 --> 00:59:25,810
It's a word...

689
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:28,729
...that describes a chemical react...

690
00:59:30,314 --> 00:59:32,983
It's just crap. I'm full of crap.

691
00:59:34,902 --> 00:59:38,280
I wait all day, just hoping
for one more minute with you...

692
00:59:38,531 --> 00:59:40,074
...and I don't even know you.

693
00:59:40,699 --> 00:59:42,368
What do you want to know?

694
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:46,121
Why you wear the same
clothes all the time.

695
00:59:46,372 --> 00:59:48,624
Why won't you give me
your phone number?

696
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:50,876
Are you married?

697
00:59:51,585 --> 00:59:52,628
No.

698
00:59:53,504 --> 00:59:54,505
Are you homeless?

699
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:57,174
No.

700
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,468
Are you a drummer?

701
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:06,392
Why don't you ever touch me?

702
01:00:10,354 --> 01:00:12,064
I don't want to hurt you.

703
01:00:14,567 --> 01:00:16,068
You won't hurt me.

704
01:00:41,093 --> 01:00:42,470
Did you feel that?

705
01:00:55,941 --> 01:00:58,277
If I could make you understand....

706
01:01:01,489 --> 01:01:02,990
I understand.

707
01:01:07,786 --> 01:01:09,413
I'll see you around.

708
01:02:14,353 --> 01:02:15,563
Hey, Doc!

709
01:02:18,357 --> 01:02:21,068
No, give me the whole package.
Come here.

710
01:02:21,986 --> 01:02:23,487
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming.

711
01:02:23,737 --> 01:02:25,072
You look great.

712
01:02:26,907 --> 01:02:27,825
Is this heaven?

713
01:02:28,242 --> 01:02:29,493
Look at this.

714
01:02:34,081 --> 01:02:35,875
Come on, let's meet some people.

715
01:02:36,292 --> 01:02:37,751
You got an appetite?

716
01:02:42,339 --> 01:02:43,757
Have a beer, Seth.

717
01:02:44,592 --> 01:02:45,593
Where you from?

718
01:02:47,011 --> 01:02:47,803
Up.

719
01:02:48,053 --> 01:02:50,222
North. Uh, Canada.

720
01:02:57,396 --> 01:02:58,939
Listen. Can you hear?

721
01:02:59,899 --> 01:03:01,358
I'm growing.

722
01:03:02,067 --> 01:03:02,985
Smile, Hannah.

723
01:03:12,745 --> 01:03:14,121
How long have you known Seth?

724
01:03:16,123 --> 01:03:17,416
Not very long.

725
01:03:18,918 --> 01:03:21,212
But I feel like I've known him forever.

726
01:03:22,296 --> 01:03:24,298
Honey, that hurts.

727
01:03:26,425 --> 01:03:28,135
You're just like Grandpa.

728
01:03:30,221 --> 01:03:31,388
Come on.

729
01:03:32,056 --> 01:03:33,390
Let's see if the cookies are done.

730
01:03:33,891 --> 01:03:34,934
Come on, Seth.

731
01:03:35,184 --> 01:03:37,394
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, great.

732
01:03:42,775 --> 01:03:44,068
How did you two meet?

733
01:03:45,778 --> 01:03:48,572
He works with me over at the site.
Construction work.

734
01:03:49,532 --> 01:03:50,783
I thought he was a messenger.

735
01:03:51,951 --> 01:03:53,994
Yeah, he's one of those...

736
01:03:54,245 --> 01:03:55,204
..."hyphenates".

737
01:03:56,121 --> 01:03:57,456
I'll be right back.

738
01:04:37,204 --> 01:04:38,789
Here, can you cut this up?

739
01:04:46,672 --> 01:04:49,175
So in what province in Canada
were you born?

740
01:04:50,176 --> 01:04:51,969
I wasn't born in Canada.

741
01:04:56,599 --> 01:04:57,892
What are your parents' names?

742
01:05:06,442 --> 01:05:07,776
No parents.

743
01:05:15,159 --> 01:05:18,037
You have very delicate hands
for a construction worker.

744
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:19,788
I'm not a construction worker.

745
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,291
Very pale hands. Let me see.

746
01:05:26,253 --> 01:05:28,631
- Why did you do that?
- Let me see your hand.

747
01:05:28,923 --> 01:05:29,799
No.

748
01:05:31,926 --> 01:05:32,927
What's your last name?

749
01:05:33,219 --> 01:05:34,345
You know my last name.

750
01:05:34,637 --> 01:05:35,805
I don't.

751
01:05:38,098 --> 01:05:39,141
Plate.

752
01:05:39,975 --> 01:05:41,018
Seth Plate?

753
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,318
I cut you.

754
01:05:51,278 --> 01:05:52,655
I cut you.

755
01:05:54,907 --> 01:05:58,869
I cut you with that knife.
I felt it go in. You felt it.

756
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:01,205
Not the way you do.

757
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:04,333
The way I do?
What does that mean?

758
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:08,212
You mean the way a doctor does?
The way a woman does? What?

759
01:06:08,504 --> 01:06:09,839
The way...

760
01:06:11,132 --> 01:06:12,091
...a human does.

761
01:06:14,635 --> 01:06:16,053
I have no sense of touch.

762
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,264
You feel that?

763
01:06:18,806 --> 01:06:20,266
Don't be frightened.

764
01:06:20,641 --> 01:06:21,809
You freak!

765
01:06:22,101 --> 01:06:23,227
You liar!

766
01:06:23,811 --> 01:06:25,563
Who... What are you?

767
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,481
I came to take Mr. Balford...

768
01:06:28,858 --> 01:06:30,401
...and I saw you.

769
01:06:32,444 --> 01:06:34,697
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

770
01:06:35,531 --> 01:06:37,366
How you fought for him.

771
01:06:39,451 --> 01:06:41,370
And you looked right at me...

772
01:06:41,996 --> 01:06:43,706
...like I was a man.

773
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:47,168
- "To take Mr. Balford"?
- I was there.

774
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:51,380
- We're always there in every room.
- What are you talking about?

775
01:06:51,881 --> 01:06:53,382
I was there in the stairwell...

776
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,343
...when you cried for your patient.

777
01:06:56,677 --> 01:06:59,054
And I touched you. Remember?

778
01:07:01,182 --> 01:07:02,725
Why are you doing this?

779
01:07:04,143 --> 01:07:05,853
Because I'm in love with you.

780
01:07:13,903 --> 01:07:15,446
I don't believe you.

781
01:07:16,405 --> 01:07:17,823
Do you feel that?

782
01:07:20,701 --> 01:07:22,161
You don't want to believe me.

783
01:07:22,828 --> 01:07:24,789
I cannot conceive of it!

784
01:07:26,832 --> 01:07:28,250
Just get out!

785
01:07:29,376 --> 01:07:30,753
Get out!

786
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:22,012
Doctor?

787
01:08:25,057 --> 01:08:26,142
Doctor?

788
01:09:13,105 --> 01:09:14,231
Hello?

789
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,323
Seth?

790
01:09:26,035 --> 01:09:27,286
Are you here?

791
01:10:24,176 --> 01:10:25,970
I want to see you.

792
01:10:28,597 --> 01:10:30,307
Let me see you.

793
01:11:00,004 --> 01:11:01,464
Just stay.

794
01:11:04,383 --> 01:11:06,594
Just stay until I fall asleep.

795
01:11:43,798 --> 01:11:45,549
Oh, yes!

796
01:11:48,469 --> 01:11:49,804
Thank you.

797
01:12:11,367 --> 01:12:13,160
The baby can't sleep.

798
01:12:13,994 --> 01:12:15,621
Has anyone ever seen the baby sleep?

799
01:12:15,996 --> 01:12:18,290
I don't know. Let's check him out.

800
01:12:27,967 --> 01:12:29,135
Choanal atresia.

801
01:12:29,385 --> 01:12:31,720
There's hardly any air getting through.

802
01:12:32,471 --> 01:12:33,389
How did you know?

803
01:12:35,474 --> 01:12:36,892
I just...

804
01:12:38,686 --> 01:12:39,687
...knew!

805
01:13:05,671 --> 01:13:06,714
Maggie?

806
01:13:07,381 --> 01:13:08,382
Yeah.

807
01:13:08,674 --> 01:13:09,800
Are you alone?

808
01:13:10,676 --> 01:13:11,677
Yeah.

809
01:13:15,764 --> 01:13:18,142
Pretty intuitive call on the baby.

810
01:13:18,559 --> 01:13:19,768
Think so?

811
01:13:21,228 --> 01:13:22,354
I couldn't have done it better.

812
01:13:23,814 --> 01:13:25,316
Well, that's a compliment.

813
01:13:40,372 --> 01:13:41,916
What are you doing?

814
01:13:42,249 --> 01:13:43,709
I'm spending time with you.

815
01:13:46,587 --> 01:13:48,005
Will you marry me?

816
01:13:49,048 --> 01:13:50,925
We can finally get up to Tahoe.

817
01:13:51,258 --> 01:13:52,718
Get married on the Nevada side...

818
01:13:53,052 --> 01:13:55,095
...honeymoon and be back
before we miss a case.

819
01:13:57,348 --> 01:13:59,850
What do you want me to do?
Get down on my knees?

820
01:14:00,518 --> 01:14:01,769
What do you want me to say?

821
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:04,438
We belong together.

822
01:14:05,022 --> 01:14:06,690
We're the same species.

823
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:16,742
I'm not very good at matters
of the heart. I mean...

824
01:14:17,368 --> 01:14:19,120
...the proverbial heart.

825
01:14:22,414 --> 01:14:23,916
Please be my wife.

826
01:14:28,462 --> 01:14:29,630
Just think about it.

827
01:14:45,354 --> 01:14:46,522
Breathe in.

828
01:14:50,484 --> 01:14:51,569
Breathe in.

829
01:15:05,124 --> 01:15:06,208
I'm good.

830
01:15:14,133 --> 01:15:18,804
I don't understand a God who would let
us meet, if we could never be together.

831
01:15:22,433 --> 01:15:23,476
He didn't tell you.

832
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:28,689
Tell me what?

833
01:15:29,356 --> 01:15:30,649
Maybe you should ask him.

834
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,110
No, I'm asking you.

835
01:15:44,622 --> 01:15:46,373
Seth knows no fear...

836
01:15:46,707 --> 01:15:47,958
...no pain...

837
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:49,794
...no hunger.

838
01:15:50,961 --> 01:15:53,339
He hears music in the sunrise.

839
01:15:55,674 --> 01:15:57,468
But he'd give it all up.

840
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,261
He loves you that much.

841
01:16:02,014 --> 01:16:03,724
I don't understand.

842
01:16:06,811 --> 01:16:08,312
He can fall.

843
01:16:08,979 --> 01:16:11,649
He can give up his existence
as he knows it.

844
01:16:11,941 --> 01:16:14,985
He can give up eternity and become...

845
01:16:15,277 --> 01:16:16,445
...one of us.

846
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,614
It's up to you.

847
01:16:20,574 --> 01:16:22,159
How do you know this?

848
01:16:28,082 --> 01:16:29,667
Because I did it.

849
01:17:07,204 --> 01:17:09,123
Seth, I need to talk to you.

850
01:17:13,586 --> 01:17:15,504
Seth, please.

851
01:17:18,591 --> 01:17:19,633
Please be here.

852
01:17:22,011 --> 01:17:23,929
God, help me through this.

853
01:17:35,316 --> 01:17:36,942
You are so beautiful.

854
01:17:39,695 --> 01:17:41,447
You'll always be that way.

855
01:17:44,992 --> 01:17:46,869
Jordan asked me to go away with him...

856
01:17:47,161 --> 01:17:48,537
...and get married.

857
01:17:51,415 --> 01:17:52,833
He knows me.

858
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:56,212
He knows the demands of my work.

859
01:17:56,796 --> 01:17:58,547
You don't love him.

860
01:17:59,757 --> 01:18:01,342
He and I are the same.

861
01:18:03,969 --> 01:18:05,387
And I want that.

862
01:18:09,141 --> 01:18:12,978
And I want somebody who can
feel my hand when I touch him.

863
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:16,357
But you can feel me.

864
01:18:16,649 --> 01:18:18,317
You felt me.

865
01:18:20,069 --> 01:18:21,779
I want to say goodbye.

866
01:18:24,073 --> 01:18:25,825
I don't want to see you again.

867
01:22:27,358 --> 01:22:28,734
Hey, buddy.

868
01:22:29,735 --> 01:22:31,195
You can't be in here.

869
01:22:32,071 --> 01:22:33,072
Do you see me?

870
01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:36,534
Do you see me?

871
01:22:36,992 --> 01:22:38,369
Can you see me?

872
01:22:38,702 --> 01:22:39,829
We can see you.

873
01:22:41,789 --> 01:22:43,207
Is this blood?

874
01:22:43,499 --> 01:22:44,375
This is blood!

875
01:22:44,792 --> 01:22:45,960
Is it red?

876
01:22:46,502 --> 01:22:47,419
Red?

877
01:22:47,878 --> 01:22:49,088
Is it red?

878
01:22:50,506 --> 01:22:51,966
Color.

879
01:22:52,299 --> 01:22:54,343
What color were the drugs you took?

880
01:22:55,678 --> 01:22:57,012
Better get your butt out of here.

881
01:22:57,930 --> 01:22:59,056
You got somewhere to go?

882
01:23:03,018 --> 01:23:04,228
Maggie.

883
01:23:16,449 --> 01:23:19,285
Down and down and down I go

884
01:23:19,577 --> 01:23:21,787
Round and round and round I go

885
01:23:22,538 --> 01:23:24,165
Round and spin

886
01:23:24,457 --> 01:23:26,584
Loving the spin I'm in

887
01:23:26,917 --> 01:23:29,420
Loving that old black magic...

888
01:23:29,712 --> 01:23:31,672
...called love

889
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:35,050
Love!

890
01:23:36,385 --> 01:23:37,553
Hi!

891
01:23:47,521 --> 01:23:50,858
I was wondering if you could tell me
how to get to the county hospital?

892
01:24:34,985 --> 01:24:36,153
Can I help you, sir?

893
01:24:36,403 --> 01:24:39,198
I'll just take a moment
to catch my breath.

894
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:41,075
Breath!

895
01:24:44,578 --> 01:24:45,621
Maggie Rice.

896
01:24:47,373 --> 01:24:48,541
Are you a patient?

897
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:50,543
No. I just need to find her, please.

898
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,295
You'll have to call her office.
Someone there can help you.

899
01:24:53,963 --> 01:24:55,172
Do you know where she is?

900
01:24:55,965 --> 01:24:57,883
No, sir, I do not know where she is.

901
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:02,888
You have this computer...

902
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:06,308
...and all this technology.
Can't you look her up?

903
01:25:10,187 --> 01:25:11,397
Where's Maggie?

904
01:25:16,777 --> 01:25:18,445
So you're a friend of Maggie's?

905
01:25:20,614 --> 01:25:21,866
What happened to you?

906
01:25:22,199 --> 01:25:23,159
Sorry.

907
01:25:23,617 --> 01:25:24,743
It's okay.

908
01:25:27,872 --> 01:25:29,081
I fell.

909
01:25:29,582 --> 01:25:32,251
Evidently. Off a train?

910
01:25:33,210 --> 01:25:34,795
I fell in love.

911
01:25:42,178 --> 01:25:43,762
Please help me find her.

912
01:25:48,976 --> 01:25:52,313
She went to Lake Tahoe. Her uncle
has a cabin on the Nevada side.

913
01:25:52,646 --> 01:25:53,647
Wait!

914
01:26:25,262 --> 01:26:26,472
Cassiel.

915
01:26:27,431 --> 01:26:28,641
Are you there?

916
01:26:37,650 --> 01:26:38,567
Hello.

917
01:27:33,789 --> 01:27:35,040
Where you headed?

918
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:37,626
Tahoe!

919
01:27:39,044 --> 01:27:40,254
Reno!

920
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:41,672
Tahoe!

921
01:27:42,339 --> 01:27:43,674
I'm going to Reno.

922
01:27:44,049 --> 01:27:45,468
I'm going to Tahoe.

923
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:48,429
Hop in. We'll figure it out
when we get there.

924
01:30:05,691 --> 01:30:07,234
Am I too late?

925
01:30:08,986 --> 01:30:09,987
Too late?

926
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:12,031
Jordan?

927
01:30:16,452 --> 01:30:18,204
I couldn't marry Jordan.

928
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:23,209
I'm in love with you.

929
01:30:31,383 --> 01:30:32,718
What happened?

930
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:37,556
Free will.

931
01:30:52,738 --> 01:30:54,240
I feel you.

932
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:14,779
Do you feel that?

933
01:32:15,154 --> 01:32:16,238
Yes.

934
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:19,533
And that?

935
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:26,415
How's it feel?
Tell me what it feels like.

936
01:32:27,458 --> 01:32:28,793
I can't.

937
01:32:30,836 --> 01:32:31,796
Try.

938
01:32:33,672 --> 01:32:34,840
Warm.

939
01:32:40,304 --> 01:32:41,597
Aching.

940
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:00,991
It's okay.

941
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:04,995
We fit together.

942
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:06,372
I know.

943
01:33:07,164 --> 01:33:09,208
We were made to fit together.

944
01:33:30,771 --> 01:33:33,774
I always asked the dying what
they liked best about living.

945
01:33:36,485 --> 01:33:38,237
Wrote it down in my book.

946
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:41,949
This is it.

947
01:33:43,576 --> 01:33:45,286
This is what I like best.

948
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:48,414
You haven't even started yet.

949
01:33:49,206 --> 01:33:51,625
We have our whole lives together.

950
01:33:51,959 --> 01:33:53,169
You and me.

951
01:33:53,419 --> 01:33:55,379
Mr. and Mrs. Plate.

952
01:39:31,924 --> 01:39:33,884
- I'll get help.
- You're here.

953
01:39:34,593 --> 01:39:36,095
- Stay.
- I should get help.

954
01:39:36,345 --> 01:39:38,389
Don't go. The driver went.

955
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:39,932
Please stay.

956
01:39:40,266 --> 01:39:42,143
Please stay with me.

957
01:39:42,935 --> 01:39:44,395
I'm scared.

958
01:39:49,108 --> 01:39:50,609
I screwed up.

959
01:39:52,027 --> 01:39:53,904
I wanted to show you everything.

960
01:39:54,363 --> 01:39:55,573
You will.

961
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:01,954
You came all this way.

962
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:04,832
I'm sorry.

963
01:40:05,916 --> 01:40:07,877
God, no, Maggie!

964
01:40:08,961 --> 01:40:10,296
To touch you...

965
01:40:10,546 --> 01:40:11,755
...and to feel you.

966
01:40:12,673 --> 01:40:15,676
To be able to hold your hand right now.

967
01:40:16,093 --> 01:40:17,261
You know what that means?

968
01:40:17,511 --> 01:40:20,181
Do you know how much I love you?

969
01:40:24,727 --> 01:40:26,812
Keep looking at me, okay?

970
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:30,191
Look right in my eyes.

971
01:40:32,151 --> 01:40:33,861
Someone's out there.

972
01:40:35,863 --> 01:40:39,283
Don't look at them.
Please don't you look at them!

973
01:40:39,533 --> 01:40:41,076
Is this what happens?

974
01:40:48,209 --> 01:40:49,210
Yes.

975
01:40:55,716 --> 01:40:57,426
This is what happens.

976
01:41:01,889 --> 01:41:03,682
I'm not afraid.

977
01:41:07,770 --> 01:41:09,438
When they ask me...

978
01:41:11,524 --> 01:41:12,900
...what I liked the best...

979
01:41:15,236 --> 01:41:16,403
...I'll tell them...

980
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:18,197
...it was you.

981
01:41:48,352 --> 01:41:49,436
God!

982
01:43:53,018 --> 01:43:55,521
I can't see you,
but I know you're there.

983
01:43:58,065 --> 01:43:59,233
I'm sorry.

984
01:44:03,028 --> 01:44:04,238
Get out.

985
01:44:06,866 --> 01:44:09,452
Was it you? Were you the one?
Were you there?

986
01:44:10,035 --> 01:44:10,953
No.

987
01:44:12,204 --> 01:44:13,414
Why did He do this?

988
01:44:13,706 --> 01:44:14,707
I don't know.

989
01:44:14,957 --> 01:44:16,125
Because her number was up?

990
01:44:17,334 --> 01:44:18,961
What do you want me to say?

991
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:29,889
- Am I being punished?
- You know better than that.

992
01:44:31,557 --> 01:44:33,184
That's life.

993
01:44:34,977 --> 01:44:36,145
You're living now.

994
01:44:38,063 --> 01:44:39,064
And one day...

995
01:44:39,732 --> 01:44:41,066
...you'll be dying.

996
01:44:47,865 --> 01:44:48,908
What's it like?

997
01:44:50,242 --> 01:44:51,160
What?

998
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:53,287
Warmth.

999
01:44:55,581 --> 01:44:56,957
It's wonderful.

1000
01:44:59,084 --> 01:45:01,253
If you'd known this was going to happen...

1001
01:45:02,963 --> 01:45:04,256
...would you have done it?

1002
01:45:10,387 --> 01:45:12,348
I would rather have had...

1003
01:45:14,099 --> 01:45:15,976
...one breath of her hair...

1004
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:21,524
...one kiss of her mouth...

1005
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:26,654
...one touch of her hand...

1006
01:45:28,864 --> 01:45:31,033
...than an eternity without it.

1007
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:35,162
One.
