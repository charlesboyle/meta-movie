1
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,254
Get ready for yard.

2
00:00:40,337 --> 00:00:42,047
Get ready for yard.

3
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:44,591
- Fuck you!
- What's his name again?

4
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:46,218
Fabrizio.

5
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:48,469
He's some
kind of tough guy, man.

6
00:00:48,553 --> 00:00:50,514
Ready for yard, gentlemen.

7
00:00:51,974 --> 00:00:55,476
Gangway!

8
00:00:55,518 --> 00:00:57,019
Yard line.

9
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:02,191
- Come on, let's bail out.
- Gangway! Move it!

10
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:04,193
Move out!

11
00:01:28,342 --> 00:01:31,053
Go in and out, man! In and out!

12
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:36,851
I ain't even sweating you, man!

13
00:01:38,894 --> 00:01:41,730
Fuck 'em up, man!
Come on, feed me, man!

14
00:01:41,813 --> 00:01:43,983
Fuck you!

15
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:57,579
Always good!

16
00:01:57,913 --> 00:01:59,538
You're just a little punk, baby.

17
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:38,786
The morning it all began,

18
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:41,247
began like any other morning.

19
00:02:50,964 --> 00:02:53,634
Oh! Oh, Bernie.

20
00:02:57,595 --> 00:03:01,057
Dad, I need lunch money
and a note for gym.

21
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:05,478
And you promised to help me
with my book report, remember?

22
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:15,530
The author devotes a lot of time
to developing the characters,

23
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:17,781
and he seduces the reader by...

24
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,577
- Seduces?
- Yeah. He, uh, draws you in, you know?

25
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,621
- You wanna know how it ends.
- But I already knew how it ended.

26
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:25,998
OK, so write it was predictable.

27
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,044
- No, Dad, I mean I've seen the movie.
- Oh. Right.

28
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:31,421
Come on. You got to eat.

29
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:33,547
Can't you think of another word?

30
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,424
"Intrigues."

31
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,927
"Intrigues." Thanks, Mom.

32
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:39,928
You're smarter than Dad, you know that?

33
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,597
Yes, God help us if he finds out.

34
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,850
If Mom's so smart, maybe she
should help you with your book report.

35
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:45,934
See what I mean?

36
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:49,146
- I have a meeting, Dee.
- Yeah, I have meetings too.

37
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,440
Amy, your book report, your call.
Me or him?

38
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,734
I choose option C
where you two get me a tutor.

39
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:58,155
- Yep. We've been through this.

40
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,491
Oh, jeez.

41
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,283
- Where is it?
- It's over there.

42
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,748
It's the hospital.

43
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,292
- Yep?
- Is this Mr. Schine?

44
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,335
Speaking.

45
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,671
I need to know
if Amy's levels have changed.

46
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:18,633
- No. No, the levels are the same.
- We need the latest results.

47
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,134
Yep.

48
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,387
I'll fax it over when I get to work.

49
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,846
Thanks.

50
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,849
You going to the ATM?

51
00:04:29,726 --> 00:04:33,147
- Who wants to live forever, right?
- You have to stay positive.

52
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,525
- At least it's not going up.
- It's not going down, either, though.

53
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:37,651
Positive.

54
00:04:41,989 --> 00:04:44,241
Amy, your bus'll be here soon.

55
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:45,992
Bye.

56
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:47,536
Bernie, you stay here.

57
00:04:47,577 --> 00:04:50,206
You used to kiss each other
goodbye in the mornings.

58
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:54,209
Shut up.

59
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:55,460
Come on.

60
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:59,381
The author intrigues the reader

61
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:01,216
by twisting the narrative

62
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:03,969
so you never know what's coming next.

63
00:05:04,052 --> 00:05:05,887
How's that?

64
00:05:05,929 --> 00:05:07,514
It's all right.

65
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:17,691
The train on platform two
is the 7:50 Red Line service

66
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:19,150
to Chicago Central.

67
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:23,822
Calling at Central Street, Davis Street,
Main Street, Rogers Park,

68
00:05:23,905 --> 00:05:27,700
Ravenswood, Clybourn
and Chicago Central.

69
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,933
Ticket.

70
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:55,602
Oh, shit.

71
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:58,313
- I meant to get one at the station.
- Nine dollars.

72
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,735
- Oh, gee. This is embarrassing.
- And it's only Monday.

73
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:07,280
My wife, she, uh, emptied my wallet
when she left for work this morning.

74
00:06:07,363 --> 00:06:09,115
Oh, so it's the wife's fault, is it?

75
00:06:09,157 --> 00:06:11,659
- Yeah. I'm trying to explain.
- It's nine dollars.

76
00:06:11,743 --> 00:06:13,411
Pay up or get off at the next stop.

77
00:06:14,204 --> 00:06:16,081
It's that simple.

78
00:06:16,164 --> 00:06:18,333
- I'll pay for him.
- What?

79
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,294
No, no. You don't have to do that.

80
00:06:21,336 --> 00:06:22,921
Don't worry about it.

81
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,387
One lucky guy.

82
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,180
No, really. It's my fault.

83
00:06:33,263 --> 00:06:35,266
It's all right. I paid, didn't I?

84
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:37,477
Here you go. Thank you very much.

85
00:06:47,194 --> 00:06:49,113
Thank you.

86
00:06:49,196 --> 00:06:52,616
Just so you know,
it wasrt an act or anything.

87
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:55,744
It was a shameless act,
and I'm a born sucker.

88
00:06:56,829 --> 00:06:58,288
Just drop it.

89
00:06:58,372 --> 00:07:01,500
- I don't want you to think...
- OK. I don't.

90
00:07:07,588 --> 00:07:11,385
I mean, there's an ATM
at Union if you're getting off there.

91
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:13,137
Tomorrow is fine.

92
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,146
Of course, there is a ten percent
interest charge overnight.

93
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:26,859
- Interest charge.
- Plus the handling fee.

94
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,526
Ouch.

95
00:07:28,568 --> 00:07:30,695
Never met a woman loan shark before.

96
00:07:30,778 --> 00:07:33,573
- You break legs too?
- Just balls.

97
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:35,825
Oh. You're a lawyer.

98
00:07:35,908 --> 00:07:38,036
I'm a financial advisor.

99
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:39,328
I cheat clients.

100
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:42,164
I'm a commercial executive.

101
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:44,417
I con housewives.

102
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,501
Where do you work?

103
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,629
JMD/March. It's a midsize place.

104
00:07:49,713 --> 00:07:51,923
We've got some
semi-decent accounts. You?

105
00:07:52,007 --> 00:07:54,844
Avery Price. It's a big place.

106
00:07:54,927 --> 00:07:57,429
We don't do semi-decent accounts.

107
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:06,813
- This your usual train?
- Why?

108
00:08:06,897 --> 00:08:10,901
- So I'll know how to pay you back.
- Nine dollars. I think I'll survive.

109
00:08:10,942 --> 00:08:13,320
No, I gotta give it back.

110
00:08:13,403 --> 00:08:15,655
I'd feel ethically impugned if I didn't.

111
00:08:17,074 --> 00:08:18,115
Impugned?

112
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:22,662
Well, I wouldn't want you
to feel impugned.

113
00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:53,109
So... if you take the same train
tomorrow, I'll pay you back.

114
00:08:56,028 --> 00:08:58,030
It's a date.

115
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:10,667
Morning.

116
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,963
- Hey.
- What up, Chaz?

117
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:17,006
Ooh, yo, I got a good one for you.

118
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,801
Seven players, 40-plus home runs,

119
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:22,595
with 11 letters in their last names.

120
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:25,890
- Yastrzemski.
- Yastrzemski.

121
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:28,226
- You got to spell that for me.
- Morning, Charles.

122
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:33,356
Y-A-S-T-R-Z-E-M-S-K-I.

123
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,483
Barry, I need a cash check.

124
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:36,775
How much and what for?

125
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:39,446
12,000. Location fee
for the Amerispend One shoot.

126
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:41,990
Don't forget to sign
the receipt this time.

127
00:09:42,073 --> 00:09:45,034
- For you, Barry, I'll sign it in blood.
- Heard that.

128
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,327
OK, that's one. I need six more.

129
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:48,913
Um...

130
00:09:48,997 --> 00:09:51,331
- Petrocelli.
- Petrocelli?

131
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:54,585
- Oh, Charles. Eliot's looking for you.
- P-E-T-R-O...

132
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:58,505
Oh, come on, yo.
That's only ten letters.

133
00:09:58,547 --> 00:09:59,882
What else you got?

134
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:03,052
Come on, Chaz,
you got 'em all last week. I need this.

135
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,470
Oh, gee.

136
00:10:04,553 --> 00:10:07,765
All right, Winston,
any of these guys National Leaguers?

137
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:11,310
I thought it was Major League or Minor
League. What's the National League?

138
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:14,188
- You don't follow baseball?
- No. Hockey's my game.

139
00:10:14,271 --> 00:10:17,024
- More gore, less bore.
- Where'd you get the questions from?

140
00:10:17,107 --> 00:10:18,650
This cop I know gives 'em to me.

141
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:20,193
Actually, he's like my uncle.

142
00:10:20,234 --> 00:10:22,278
He's obsessed. Loves challenging me.

143
00:10:22,362 --> 00:10:24,573
Said if I get it right, I get 100 bucks,

144
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:26,574
and you know I gots
to make that money.

145
00:10:26,616 --> 00:10:28,576
Wait. You don't know the answers?

146
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:30,870
No. Duh.
That's why I come to you, Chaz.

147
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:33,915
Where you been? You're late.

148
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:35,750
- Come on.
- Sorry.

149
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:39,045
This is not a lady
who likes to wait, you know.

150
00:10:40,254 --> 00:10:41,714
Susan.

151
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:44,133
- Charles.
- Hi.

152
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:47,928
I guess you're here
to raise our commission, eh?

153
00:10:48,011 --> 00:10:49,555
We have some issues.

154
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:52,141
We feel like no matter
how much we talk to you,

155
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:55,185
we just don't get heard by you people.

156
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:57,396
This last commercial
is a case in point.

157
00:10:57,479 --> 00:11:00,441
We agreed on a strategy.
We signed off on it.

158
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:01,942
Then what happened?

159
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:06,613
You went off
in all these other directions.

160
00:11:06,655 --> 00:11:09,825
The cut you sent us, it's nothing
like how we said it should be.

161
00:11:09,908 --> 00:11:12,536
Look, Susan, the directions
I took were, you know...

162
00:11:12,619 --> 00:11:15,747
I've been doing this for ten years, OK?

163
00:11:21,586 --> 00:11:22,546
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:24,255 --> 00:11:26,550
I'll do it however it is
you want it done.

165
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:29,803
The time for apologies is over.

166
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:32,138
What we need now is change.

167
00:11:34,975 --> 00:11:36,768
You don't want me on the account?

168
00:11:38,894 --> 00:11:42,106
Uh, Susan appreciates all you've done.

169
00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:43,984
You have different visions.

170
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:01,292
You might have backed me up in there.

171
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,336
Backed you up!
Susan Davis is a $130 million client.

172
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:06,629
- She's a bitch.
- She's the worst kind of bitch.

173
00:12:06,713 --> 00:12:09,842
She has a point. You're in a rut,
my friend, and you know it.

174
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:13,678
Forget Susan Davis.

175
00:12:13,762 --> 00:12:17,015
Get a new account, get back
on your feet, back to what you do best.

176
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:20,518
Goddamn it.

177
00:12:20,602 --> 00:12:23,813
Talk to me, tell me what's going on,
maybe I can help.

178
00:12:23,855 --> 00:12:25,648
Impugned.

179
00:12:25,732 --> 00:12:27,817
That's a word, isn't it?

180
00:12:34,366 --> 00:12:37,369
Shut up, Bernie.
I live here. Amy, please!

181
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,871
Bernie, cut it out.

182
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:44,167
- You're late.
- Sorry.

183
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:46,044
How was work?

184
00:12:46,127 --> 00:12:48,838
Work was...

185
00:12:48,922 --> 00:12:51,507
...fine. You?

186
00:12:52,884 --> 00:12:55,804
Guess who's decided
to monitor me this week?

187
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:58,722
- Ethan Jeffries.
- Oh. The asshole.

188
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:02,060
He always throws a fit
when I stray from the lesson plan.

189
00:13:02,143 --> 00:13:03,852
There's a lot of that going around.

190
00:13:03,894 --> 00:13:05,062
So, what did I do?

191
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:07,940
Handed out an English composition
in the math hour today.

192
00:13:08,023 --> 00:13:09,775
He chew you out in front of the kids?

193
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:13,570
The title for the composition
was "Why We Like Principal Jeffries."

194
00:13:15,155 --> 00:13:17,699
Uh, Jerry called.
There's a message on the machine.

195
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,033
Where you going?

196
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:22,538
I have a PTA meeting.
It's been on the calendar for six weeks.

197
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:24,831
Right.

198
00:13:24,914 --> 00:13:27,166
Amy needs to be quizzed
for her history test,

199
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,211
and Bernie needs to pee.

200
00:13:34,757 --> 00:13:36,759
Name the act that banned alcohol.

201
00:13:36,844 --> 00:13:38,721
Volstead Act.

202
00:13:38,762 --> 00:13:40,888
- What year?
- 1919.

203
00:13:40,972 --> 00:13:43,474
- Huh?
- 1919.

204
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:47,687
Yeah. Do you think we can turn
this down a notch below deafening?

205
00:13:48,855 --> 00:13:50,106
Amy!

206
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:52,900
OK.

207
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:05,246
How long...?

208
00:14:16,965 --> 00:14:20,302
- How long did Prohibition last?
- Fourteen years.

209
00:16:27,468 --> 00:16:29,261
Pay up, buster.

210
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:30,762
Hey.

211
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:32,555
I looked for you.

212
00:16:32,597 --> 00:16:34,099
Yeah, right. Gimme my money.

213
00:16:34,183 --> 00:16:35,851
Really. I did.

214
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:40,396
- Is that your daughter?
- Yeah.

215
00:16:40,438 --> 00:16:43,025
- Amy.
- Oh.

216
00:16:43,108 --> 00:16:44,942
Mine's a few years younger.

217
00:16:45,026 --> 00:16:47,904
- What's her name?
- Amber.

218
00:16:50,824 --> 00:16:53,576
- Oh, she's adorable.
- Yeah.

219
00:16:53,618 --> 00:16:56,245
They make it all won'th it, don't they?

220
00:17:09,717 --> 00:17:11,135
Nice briefcase.

221
00:17:11,219 --> 00:17:13,720
It was a gift... from my wife.

222
00:17:13,804 --> 00:17:17,767
Oh, jeez. Guess I should
get one for my husband, huh?

223
00:17:19,227 --> 00:17:24,856
"If lost, please return
to Charles Christopher Schine."

224
00:17:26,484 --> 00:17:29,778
Charles Christopher Schine.
Isn't Schine a Jewish name?

225
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,322
- Rabbinically.
- Christopher Schine.

226
00:17:32,364 --> 00:17:35,367
My mom was Catholic.
I got all kinds of guilt.

227
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,411
Oh. How's that working out for you?

228
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:39,454
Fine. I had a lot of therapy
when I was a kid.

229
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:42,707
- You're kinda funny, aren't you?
- You're an easy crowd.

230
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:47,421
- What's your name?
- Lucinda.

231
00:17:47,504 --> 00:17:49,296
Lucinda Harris.

232
00:17:51,757 --> 00:17:55,095
So we came here when I was little,
just me and my mom.

233
00:17:55,178 --> 00:17:57,430
- We were only gonna stay a year.
- Mm-hm.

234
00:17:58,389 --> 00:18:00,599
- How about you?
- Oh, all over.

235
00:18:00,683 --> 00:18:04,311
I was an Army brat.
I grew up everywhere and nowhere.

236
00:18:04,395 --> 00:18:06,272
My address changed every six months,

237
00:18:06,355 --> 00:18:08,024
and so did my best friend.

238
00:18:09,692 --> 00:18:12,486
But, then again, I got to change too.

239
00:18:12,528 --> 00:18:15,531
If I screwed up in Fort Hood, Texas,

240
00:18:15,614 --> 00:18:18,199
they didn't have to know about it
in Saratoga, New York.

241
00:18:18,283 --> 00:18:20,494
I could just be this whole other person.

242
00:18:20,536 --> 00:18:23,039
That happen a lot? You screwing up?

243
00:18:23,122 --> 00:18:24,831
Mm-hm. Yep.

244
00:18:24,873 --> 00:18:27,292
I was the consummate rebel
against authority.

245
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,671
- Oh, is that what you called it?
- No, that's what my parents called it.

246
00:18:30,755 --> 00:18:32,047
I called it getting lit.

247
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,553
But then I got my act together
when I got out of school,

248
00:18:37,595 --> 00:18:40,180
and Dad really wanted a lawyer.

249
00:18:40,263 --> 00:18:41,890
He settled for a banker.

250
00:18:42,974 --> 00:18:46,186
The next stop
is Chicago Union Station.

251
00:18:46,227 --> 00:18:48,229
This is the end of the Red Line.

252
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:51,066
All passengers,
please disembark at this time.

253
00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:52,359
Thank you.

254
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:55,028
Busy day?

255
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,655
Oh, in finance, every day is a busy day.

256
00:18:57,739 --> 00:19:01,075
Oh, I bet you're getting a lot of angry
calls with an economy like this.

257
00:19:01,158 --> 00:19:04,079
Well, if you consider
death threats angry.

258
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:05,246
Tell me about it.

259
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,581
Clients, they love you
when times are good...

260
00:19:07,664 --> 00:19:11,001
No, no, no, when times are good,
you never make them enough money.

261
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:14,047
There's always some cousin
or brother or grandmother

262
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:17,549
whose stock split 64 ways,
and why can't you sell 'em one of those,

263
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:19,677
like I got some
crystal ball or something.

264
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,221
Tell me about it.
I got fired off my biggest account.

265
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:25,391
My boss didn't even warn me.
Supposed to be a good friend of mine.

266
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:28,644
That bastard.
Do you want me to yell at him for you?

267
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:31,021
Give me his number,
I'll crank-call him.

268
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:39,071
Some people just don't know how
to appreciate what they've got.

269
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,926
Morning, Charles.

270
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,323
Yes, sir.

271
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,284
- What up, Chaz?
- Hey.

272
00:20:27,325 --> 00:20:29,745
You all right?
You look a little sick in the face,

273
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,414
- like you got the bug.
- No.

274
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:34,291
- It ain't contagious, is it?
- It's nothing.

275
00:20:34,374 --> 00:20:37,002
- That's what Dick Lembergh said.
- Who's Dick Lembergh?

276
00:20:37,085 --> 00:20:39,254
Ain't nobody now.
That motherfucker dead.

277
00:20:40,922 --> 00:20:42,132
Winston.

278
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:46,428
Come here. Let me ask you something.

279
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:50,307
- This about the computers?
- No, no.

280
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,017
I appreciate what you did for me.

281
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,144
Forget about it. Buy me a beer sometime.
This is something else.

282
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:56,687
Go ahead. Shoot for it.

283
00:20:59,983 --> 00:21:03,361
Say you went to the movies,
but you forgot your money,

284
00:21:03,444 --> 00:21:05,696
and someone offered
to buy your ticket for you.

285
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,700
- In Chicago?
- I'm just saying, hypothetically.

286
00:21:08,742 --> 00:21:11,952
It's only right
to talk to them, isn't it?

287
00:21:12,036 --> 00:21:15,791
I mean, thank them.
Show you appreciate it somehow, right?

288
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,084
This full price or matinee?

289
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:21,003
That's the difference
between five or ten bucks, man.

290
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:22,171
You know what?

291
00:21:22,254 --> 00:21:23,505
Never mind.

292
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:27,009
Hey, yo. I asked that cop
about those questions,

293
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:29,345
and three other players
were National League.

294
00:21:29,387 --> 00:21:30,720
I'm still working on that.

295
00:21:30,804 --> 00:21:33,974
I need those answers
by tomorrow to get that moola, baby.

296
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:37,560
- We're cool about the computers, right?
- Yes, Winston. We're cool.

297
00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:38,645
Chaz.

298
00:21:38,728 --> 00:21:41,607
We're cool about the computers, right?

299
00:22:02,168 --> 00:22:03,294
Avery Price.

300
00:22:03,378 --> 00:22:05,296
- Lucinda.
- You mean Lucinda Harris?

301
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,631
Yeah. Could you tell her
it's Charles Schine?

302
00:22:07,715 --> 00:22:10,010
I'll put you through to her office.

303
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,683
- Charles.
- Hey.

304
00:22:17,934 --> 00:22:20,394
We have this beautiful house
in Lake Forest,

305
00:22:20,477 --> 00:22:23,063
just the kind of house
I dreamed about as a kid.

306
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:24,732
What's your husband do?

307
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:27,735
- He golfs.
- For a living?

308
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:29,028
He wishes.

309
00:22:29,111 --> 00:22:31,905
No, he's a broker. We met at Stanford.

310
00:22:31,989 --> 00:22:36,118
He's up at 3am so he can be
in the offices when London opens.

311
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:37,953
We also have an apartment in the city.

312
00:22:38,037 --> 00:22:40,581
He stays there during the week
to avoid the commute,

313
00:22:40,622 --> 00:22:42,623
and of course,
the weekends are for golf.

314
00:22:42,665 --> 00:22:44,209
So when do you see each other?

315
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:46,879
The usuals.

316
00:22:46,962 --> 00:22:49,756
Birthdays, Christmases.

317
00:22:49,797 --> 00:22:52,551
We communicate mainly via Hallmark.

318
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,638
But hey, I have a beautiful,
wonderful baby girl, so there.

319
00:23:18,493 --> 00:23:19,869
Deanna!

320
00:23:20,995 --> 00:23:22,413
Amy. Amy!

321
00:23:22,497 --> 00:23:23,498
Can you hear me?

322
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:24,998
Can you hear me, sweetheart?

323
00:23:25,082 --> 00:23:26,792
Breathe. Breathe, Amy.

324
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:29,212
Breathe. There you go.

325
00:23:30,588 --> 00:23:33,340
Daddy's here. It's OK.

326
00:23:34,174 --> 00:23:36,969
Everything's OK. Daddy's here.

327
00:23:37,053 --> 00:23:38,845
There you go.

328
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:40,222
There you go, sweetheart.

329
00:23:41,306 --> 00:23:42,599
Stay with me.

330
00:23:45,936 --> 00:23:48,480
There you go. There you go.

331
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,483
It's OK, sweetheart. It's OK.

332
00:23:51,525 --> 00:23:53,025
Shh.

333
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:56,029
Amy. There you go.

334
00:23:56,071 --> 00:23:57,906
- It's all right, baby.
- There you go.

335
00:24:01,242 --> 00:24:03,995
- Diabetes?
- Type 1. Worst kind.

336
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:06,164
We took out
a second mortgage on the house

337
00:24:06,206 --> 00:24:08,541
to get her one of those
mobile dialysis machines

338
00:24:08,624 --> 00:24:11,420
so she doesn't have to go
to the hospital every day.

339
00:24:11,503 --> 00:24:14,423
Can't they, um...?
Can't they give her a new kidney?

340
00:24:14,505 --> 00:24:16,465
They have. Three times.

341
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:19,010
Her body keeps rejecting them.

342
00:24:19,051 --> 00:24:23,764
There's this new anti-rejection drug
coming out, supposed to be amazing.

343
00:24:23,848 --> 00:24:26,517
Has to be approved,
but they say it's got a 99 percent rate

344
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,811
- of success in the tests so far.
- Expensive?

345
00:24:28,894 --> 00:24:31,230
Like you wouldn't believe.

346
00:24:31,313 --> 00:24:33,858
And, of course,
insurance won't cover it.

347
00:24:33,899 --> 00:24:36,192
Sure. Probably cheaper
to let her suffer, right?

348
00:24:36,234 --> 00:24:38,195
We're OK.

349
00:24:38,237 --> 00:24:40,823
We've been saving for years.

350
00:24:41,866 --> 00:24:44,367
So now we just sit around
and wait for the call.

351
00:24:50,582 --> 00:24:53,209
Hi. Amy, don't let Bernie out.

352
00:24:53,293 --> 00:24:54,544
Hey. You home?

353
00:24:54,586 --> 00:24:56,422
Yeah, just now. What's wrong?

354
00:24:56,505 --> 00:24:58,214
I just got out of Eliot's office.

355
00:24:58,256 --> 00:25:01,217
He slammed me
with some big new account.

356
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:05,221
I'm gonna be home late,
so, uh, don't wait up.

357
00:25:05,263 --> 00:25:09,225
All right. How come you're
calling from your cell phone?

358
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:10,727
Amy, your bag's in the back.

359
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:12,561
I don't know.

360
00:25:12,603 --> 00:25:16,483
I'm just down the hall and wanted
to let you know as soon as possible.

361
00:25:16,566 --> 00:25:18,526
Thanks.

362
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,944
I'm sorry.
It's been kind of hectic lately.

363
00:25:21,028 --> 00:25:23,114
Um, I gotta go.

364
00:25:23,198 --> 00:25:25,158
All right. See ya.

365
00:25:25,241 --> 00:25:26,742
Bye.

366
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,660
Yeah. All right, honey.

367
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:51,725
Excuse me.

368
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:52,935
Same again?

369
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:54,894
I'm drinking you under the bar, mister.

370
00:25:54,977 --> 00:25:56,479
- Really?
- Yeah.

371
00:25:56,562 --> 00:25:59,483
- I bet I can do it in three drinks.
- You like to gamble?

372
00:25:59,566 --> 00:26:02,193
It's not really gambling
when you never lose.

373
00:26:02,276 --> 00:26:04,153
- I got a bet.
- Really?

374
00:26:04,237 --> 00:26:06,281
I'll bet you $20

375
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:10,076
that I can kiss you
without ever touching your lips.

376
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,745
- Kiss me?
- Without touching.

377
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:14,330
How?

378
00:26:14,414 --> 00:26:16,332
What do you mean, how?
That's the bet.

379
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:18,292
OK. Let me see the 20.

380
00:26:45,861 --> 00:26:48,613
Worth every penny.

381
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:52,492
What are we doing?

382
00:26:54,286 --> 00:26:56,538
I've never done this before.

383
00:26:56,621 --> 00:26:58,206
Me neither.

384
00:26:58,874 --> 00:27:01,835
All the years I've been married,
never lied to my husband.

385
00:27:01,918 --> 00:27:03,170
Not once.

386
00:27:03,211 --> 00:27:03,295
Bartender! Johnny Walker Black Label,
no ice, please.

387
00:27:03,295 --> 00:27:05,797
Bartender! Johnny Walker Black Label,
no ice, please.

388
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,967
- Excuse us, please.
- Oh, there she is. Hello, beautiful.

389
00:27:09,051 --> 00:27:10,802
- Can I buy you a drink?
- I have a drink.

390
00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:12,346
Can I buy you the bar then?

391
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:14,513
Do yourself a favor, buy a better line.

392
00:27:14,555 --> 00:27:16,558
Excuse me, we're talking here.

393
00:27:16,641 --> 00:27:18,810
No, buddy, we were talking,
you were just...

394
00:27:18,894 --> 00:27:20,686
You were standing looking like a fag.

395
00:27:20,728 --> 00:27:23,064
- OK, Charles...
- Charles, you run along.

396
00:27:23,147 --> 00:27:25,192
The lady and I are gonna get acquainted.

397
00:27:25,275 --> 00:27:27,235
- Where you going?
- Get your hands off me.

398
00:27:27,318 --> 00:27:30,404
Fine. Relax. You stupid whore.

399
00:27:32,615 --> 00:27:34,450
Take it easy, buddy.

400
00:27:35,242 --> 00:27:37,703
Can we get some ice, please?

401
00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:56,930
Taxi!

402
00:28:00,434 --> 00:28:02,436
Taxi!

403
00:28:28,962 --> 00:28:32,923
- That one?
- No. My husband meets clients there.

404
00:28:38,721 --> 00:28:40,055
Hey, how about that one?

405
00:28:43,642 --> 00:28:45,894
- You OK?
- Yeah.

406
00:28:51,984 --> 00:28:54,278
- Stop the cab, please.
- Sure, lady.

407
00:28:57,781 --> 00:29:00,867
I can't, Charles. I'm sorry.

408
00:29:03,495 --> 00:29:06,081
- Keep the change.
- Thanks, buddy.

409
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:08,499
Good luck with her.

410
00:29:16,382 --> 00:29:18,134
I know, I know.

411
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:56,839
- How much for a room?
- Forty-six dollars.

412
00:29:56,923 --> 00:30:00,008
You want to use the hotel safe?
It's an extra ten.

413
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:02,177
No, just the room, please.

414
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:12,479
It's that way.

415
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:23,865
... 45 minutes waiting
for you to come upstairs.

416
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:25,701
I was stressed. I had a drink.

417
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:28,202
What do you mean,
stressed, a drink?

418
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,749
What about me? What about me?

419
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:36,877
Just shut the fuck up!
What is wrong with you?

420
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:41,132
I won't shut the fuck up.
It is 3:00 in the morning.

421
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,207
Beautiful.

422
00:32:01,293 --> 00:32:03,212
So, what do you think?

423
00:32:18,018 --> 00:32:19,812
You wanna stay, or you wanna go?

424
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:32,031
I don't know.

425
00:32:39,706 --> 00:32:41,665
I think, um...

426
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,754
I think I wanna fuck you.

427
00:34:31,982 --> 00:34:35,818
You make one sound,
I'll blow your fucking heads apart.

428
00:34:37,237 --> 00:34:39,114
Shh!

429
00:34:41,992 --> 00:34:43,158
Always...

430
00:34:43,242 --> 00:34:47,038
...chain your door in a place like this.

431
00:34:47,122 --> 00:34:49,249
But, hey, thanks for the invite.

432
00:34:49,332 --> 00:34:50,749
I'll give you all my money.

433
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:55,005
"No sound" means you shut the fuck up.

434
00:34:55,088 --> 00:34:57,548
- Please don't hurt him.
- You get that?

435
00:34:57,631 --> 00:34:59,800
Give me your fucking wallets now.

436
00:35:00,592 --> 00:35:03,221
Come on, give me your wallet.
Come on, come on.

437
00:35:13,564 --> 00:35:16,066
This doesn't look like her...

438
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,484
...Charlie.

439
00:35:18,277 --> 00:35:20,445
Hmm.

440
00:35:27,368 --> 00:35:30,289
That stupid fuck
doesn't look like you, neither.

441
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:35,585
Lucinda.
You two fucking around, huh?

442
00:35:36,794 --> 00:35:39,298
Slumming it, ain't ya?

443
00:35:40,048 --> 00:35:42,300
You're fucking slumming it,
you piece of shit.

444
00:35:42,383 --> 00:35:43,926
Isn't that exciting?

445
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,346
Please, just take the money.

446
00:35:47,555 --> 00:35:49,932
Chuck, I already took your money.

447
00:35:50,016 --> 00:35:53,686
You see this? This was your money,
and I took it. Now it's mine.

448
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:56,356
- I promise we won't go to the police.
- I know you won't

449
00:35:56,439 --> 00:35:59,067
'cause you look like a nice guy.
Ain't you a nice guy?

450
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,735
You look nice to me.

451
00:36:02,903 --> 00:36:06,324
She looks kinda nice. Are you nice?

452
00:36:06,407 --> 00:36:07,909
Lucinda.

453
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,577
Oh! No!

454
00:36:10,661 --> 00:36:14,082
- Let her go, please.
- Come on, come on.

455
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:17,042
- Please.
- How can I let her go,

456
00:36:17,084 --> 00:36:18,877
such a fine piece of ass like that?

457
00:36:19,294 --> 00:36:20,295
Look at that.

458
00:36:21,505 --> 00:36:25,676
Me and fucking Lucinda,
we gotta do a lot of things together.

459
00:36:25,759 --> 00:36:27,052
All kinds of shit.

460
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:29,304
Oh, man.

461
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:31,306
I could make you scream, you know?

462
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,558
Is she better than
your wife at home? Ha.

463
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:37,186
Look at that.

464
00:36:41,441 --> 00:36:43,402
Aah!

465
00:36:43,443 --> 00:36:45,027
What'd you say, Charlie?

466
00:36:46,445 --> 00:36:48,991
I can fuck her? Well, thanks... Charlie.

467
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:51,034
I knew you were a nice guy.

468
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:56,914
Whoa! Where you going, Lucinda?

469
00:36:56,956 --> 00:36:59,917
You gonna take it from him,
or you gonna go for a whole lot more?

470
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,766
Shh!

471
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,393
Check this out, Charlie.

472
00:37:17,476 --> 00:37:20,270
Championship fucking, right here.

473
00:37:20,312 --> 00:37:22,355
- Twelve rounder.
- No.

474
00:37:25,484 --> 00:37:27,444
Aah!

475
00:37:27,485 --> 00:37:29,362
- Oh, please.
- Shut up!

476
00:37:31,865 --> 00:37:34,576
- Yeah, you don't wanna miss this.
- No!

477
00:37:45,587 --> 00:37:49,423
Please. No, please. Please.

478
00:37:54,012 --> 00:37:57,097
Hey, Chuck, fuck her like that.

479
00:37:58,515 --> 00:38:01,186
Come on, Chuck. Don't fail me, man.

480
00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:03,437
Round four coming up.

481
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:10,277
No, stop, please!

482
00:39:06,249 --> 00:39:07,582
I'll take you to a hospital.

483
00:39:25,517 --> 00:39:27,645
I'm so sorry.

484
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,778
I'll call the police.

485
00:39:40,115 --> 00:39:41,658
No. No.

486
00:39:42,908 --> 00:39:45,412
We... We gotta give a description.

487
00:39:45,495 --> 00:39:47,080
Stop. Stop it.

488
00:39:54,796 --> 00:39:56,214
No.

489
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,926
The police are gonna wanna know
what we were doing here.

490
00:40:02,678 --> 00:40:04,972
So we tell them.

491
00:40:05,056 --> 00:40:06,599
We have to.

492
00:40:08,476 --> 00:40:10,061
Can't.

493
00:40:13,939 --> 00:40:16,067
Oh, my God, my family.

494
00:40:18,818 --> 00:40:21,614
Well, what do you want me to do?

495
00:40:23,824 --> 00:40:25,534
Tell me what to do.

496
00:40:26,826 --> 00:40:29,246
I just want you to get me out of here.

497
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:01,527
55 East Erie, please.

498
00:41:33,434 --> 00:41:35,602
Holy shit, Chaz.

499
00:41:35,686 --> 00:41:38,313
- Oh, my God!
- Looks like you got hit by a train.

500
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,902
I'm OK. I'm fine.

501
00:41:43,944 --> 00:41:47,155
- I just had a little accident.
- What the hell happened?

502
00:41:48,949 --> 00:41:50,993
- I got mugged.
- Jesus.

503
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:55,580
I've just been to the hospital. Doctor
said I'm good. No permanent damage.

504
00:41:55,663 --> 00:41:58,334
- You get a look at this guy, Chaz?
- No.

505
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:03,046
You call the police?

506
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,548
They're gonna call me
if my wallet turns up.

507
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:08,676
Maybe you oughta go home.
Did you call Deanna?

508
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,220
Yeah.

509
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,764
There's just, um,
a couple of things I gotta do.

510
00:42:13,805 --> 00:42:17,268
Um... cancel my credit cards.

511
00:42:17,352 --> 00:42:19,228
- Call the DMV.
- Charles.

512
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,354
Don't be stupid.

513
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,356
Go home. OK?

514
00:42:34,117 --> 00:42:36,119
Goddamn city.

515
00:42:36,203 --> 00:42:38,163
I hate it.

516
00:42:39,665 --> 00:42:41,708
I work in the city, Dee.

517
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:44,044
I can'tjust quit my job.
What would I do?

518
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:46,588
You could teach again.

519
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,673
You used to be a great teacher.

520
00:42:48,756 --> 00:42:51,468
My job is what allows us
to save for Amy's drugs.

521
00:42:51,551 --> 00:42:54,096
How do we do that
on a pair of teachers' salaries?

522
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:55,514
We could sell the house.

523
00:42:55,596 --> 00:42:58,724
We've already got
two mortgages on the house.

524
00:42:58,808 --> 00:43:00,811
Selling it doesn't do us any good.

525
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:03,980
Mom?

526
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,815
Yeah. Hi, sweetie.

527
00:43:18,327 --> 00:43:19,620
Deanna, can you get that?

528
00:43:22,081 --> 00:43:24,457
- Dee!
- Excuse me.

529
00:43:24,499 --> 00:43:26,002
Just give me a minute.

530
00:43:34,677 --> 00:43:35,803
Yeah.

531
00:43:35,845 --> 00:43:37,638
Hey, Charlie.

532
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,142
Charlie? Can you hear me?

533
00:43:42,183 --> 00:43:45,479
- What do you want? How did...?
- Well, how's your busted nose?

534
00:43:45,562 --> 00:43:48,690
- Still hurting?
- Why are you calling me?

535
00:43:48,773 --> 00:43:52,861
Just checking out if you were keeping
your promise about the police and all.

536
00:43:52,944 --> 00:43:55,905
'Cause after all,
a promise is a promise, huh?

537
00:43:55,989 --> 00:43:58,116
- Hello?
- I got it. It's business.

538
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:01,328
A business call. Honey, for God's sake.

539
00:44:01,411 --> 00:44:02,579
Excuse me. Who's this?

540
00:44:02,662 --> 00:44:04,372
Well, this is Mr. LaRoche.

541
00:44:04,456 --> 00:44:06,458
Mr. LaRoche,
my husband's had a rough day.

542
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:08,667
- Can this wait?
- What happened?

543
00:44:08,709 --> 00:44:11,796
- He was mugged.
- Charles, I had no idea.

544
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,506
Please, I'm sorry.
Why didn't you tell me so?

545
00:44:14,548 --> 00:44:17,885
Honey, can you hang up, please?

546
00:44:17,968 --> 00:44:19,471
OK, hon.

547
00:44:19,554 --> 00:44:23,724
So you haven't told her. Huh? Have you?

548
00:44:23,807 --> 00:44:27,228
You haven't told your wife
you're fucking Lucinda.

549
00:44:27,312 --> 00:44:29,647
You listen to me, you fucking asshole!

550
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:31,857
You go near her again,
I swear to God...

551
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,693
I need a loan, Charlie.

552
00:44:34,735 --> 00:44:37,071
I really hate to ask,
but I'm a little short,

553
00:44:37,154 --> 00:44:39,531
and since you canceled
your credit cards, well,

554
00:44:39,573 --> 00:44:41,575
you know what? I need 20,000.

555
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:44,577
That's ridiculous. I don't have 20,000.

556
00:44:44,661 --> 00:44:47,665
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
you're a big fucking executive.

557
00:44:47,748 --> 00:44:50,083
I don't have that kind
of cash just lying around.

558
00:44:50,166 --> 00:44:53,671
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, man, I just
don't give a shit about your cash flow.

559
00:44:53,754 --> 00:44:56,548
I want 20,000 now, you hear me?

560
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:59,175
OK, OK. I'll get it.

561
00:44:59,258 --> 00:45:00,301
What'll you get?

562
00:45:00,385 --> 00:45:02,095
I want to hear it because, you know,

563
00:45:02,178 --> 00:45:05,056
my English is not very good.

564
00:45:05,098 --> 00:45:07,058
I'll get you the 20,000.

565
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,435
OK.
Well, thank you, Charlie.

566
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:12,188
Corner of Western
and Parkway, noon, Friday.

567
00:45:13,106 --> 00:45:16,067
- Don't ever call me at home again...
- Au revoir, Charlie.

568
00:45:26,952 --> 00:45:28,830
Hey.

569
00:45:28,913 --> 00:45:30,665
You OK?

570
00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:35,711
I haven't seen you
on the train all week.

571
00:45:36,753 --> 00:45:40,340
I've called in sick the whole week.

572
00:45:40,424 --> 00:45:42,968
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

573
00:45:43,802 --> 00:45:46,431
- So he called you.
- I think we should go to the police.

574
00:45:46,472 --> 00:45:51,310
No! No, Charles.
You're not understanding me.

575
00:45:51,393 --> 00:45:54,520
If my husband finds out
that I had an affair,

576
00:45:54,603 --> 00:45:56,940
he will file for divorce.
He will do anything.

577
00:45:56,982 --> 00:45:58,025
What do you mean?

578
00:45:58,108 --> 00:45:59,651
He'll take my daughter.

579
00:45:59,735 --> 00:46:00,736
- Really?
- Yes.

580
00:46:00,819 --> 00:46:03,362
You don't know him. He's not like you.

581
00:46:05,282 --> 00:46:08,451
Now this is all I can spare
without my husband noticing.

582
00:46:08,492 --> 00:46:10,494
No. No way. No. I'll take care of it.

583
00:46:12,163 --> 00:46:15,167
I just wanted to make sure you're OK.

584
00:46:16,584 --> 00:46:18,836
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

585
00:46:21,923 --> 00:46:23,716
I'm sorry.

586
00:46:27,178 --> 00:46:29,305
Hey.

587
00:46:30,013 --> 00:46:31,641
I want to see you.

588
00:46:31,724 --> 00:46:34,226
I can't, Charles. I'm sorry. I can't.

589
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:41,651
What?

590
00:47:25,151 --> 00:47:26,528
Where you going?

591
00:47:26,569 --> 00:47:28,529
Come on, we're talking to you.

592
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:33,410
Goddamn dog.

593
00:47:35,244 --> 00:47:38,289
- Fuck you don't watch where you going?
- Sorry.

594
00:47:38,372 --> 00:47:40,791
Sorry don't pay the bills, white boy.

595
00:47:40,874 --> 00:47:43,544
Sorry don't stop
world wars or feed the poor.

596
00:47:43,585 --> 00:47:45,671
As far as I'm concerned,
sorry's for shit.

597
00:47:45,754 --> 00:47:47,881
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

598
00:47:47,923 --> 00:47:50,217
Charlie, is it?

599
00:47:50,259 --> 00:47:51,468
Your name Charlie?

600
00:47:52,428 --> 00:47:54,638
- Yeah.
- Call you Chuck?

601
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:00,561
- Where's LaRoche?
- I'll take you to him.

602
00:48:00,602 --> 00:48:02,729
Fuck you think I'm here for,
conversation?

603
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:05,940
Look, why don't I
just give you the money?

604
00:48:06,024 --> 00:48:08,652
Hey, you're not giving me shit,
you understand?

605
00:48:08,736 --> 00:48:10,194
You gotta see Frenchie.

606
00:48:12,113 --> 00:48:15,199
Up against the wall,
and don't fucking move!

607
00:48:22,915 --> 00:48:25,001
So you write commercials, huh?

608
00:48:25,084 --> 00:48:26,419
Yeah.

609
00:48:26,502 --> 00:48:30,673
I made this demo for this
coffee commercial this one time.

610
00:48:30,757 --> 00:48:32,633
It was a fine piece of music.

611
00:48:32,716 --> 00:48:33,843
- Really?
- Yeah.

612
00:48:33,926 --> 00:48:35,303
What'd they say?

613
00:48:35,386 --> 00:48:38,388
They said people
who drink coffee don't like rap.

614
00:48:38,472 --> 00:48:41,683
- That's ridiculous.
- That's what I said.

615
00:48:41,767 --> 00:48:45,063
So, uh, if I get somethir to you,

616
00:48:45,146 --> 00:48:47,981
you give it a listen,
uh, see what you can do with it?

617
00:48:48,065 --> 00:48:50,567
- Yeah. Sure.
- Huh.

618
00:48:55,113 --> 00:48:56,198
Hey.

619
00:48:58,116 --> 00:48:59,493
Charlie.

620
00:49:06,958 --> 00:49:10,754
Man, you look like shit.

621
00:49:12,714 --> 00:49:14,757
Nice briefcase, though.

622
00:49:31,107 --> 00:49:32,650
Well...

623
00:49:36,028 --> 00:49:37,488
Thanks, Charlie.

624
00:49:39,115 --> 00:49:41,993
That's for canceling your credit cards.

625
00:49:43,868 --> 00:49:47,081
- It is a nice briefcase.
- It is a nice briefcase.

626
00:49:47,164 --> 00:49:49,333
Keep your head up, homey.

627
00:50:19,696 --> 00:50:22,032
I don't often go into the city.

628
00:50:22,115 --> 00:50:23,825
But when I do,

629
00:50:23,908 --> 00:50:27,995
I find comfort
in the knowledge that my

630
00:50:28,078 --> 00:50:32,000
Amerispend One card...

631
00:50:32,666 --> 00:50:35,628
Ameris... Amerispend One...

632
00:50:35,711 --> 00:50:37,672
Shit.

633
00:50:37,756 --> 00:50:39,798
I... I... What's...

634
00:50:39,882 --> 00:50:43,135
Susan Davis calls this
retro avant-garde.

635
00:50:43,218 --> 00:50:45,554
I think it's more retro avant-crap.

636
00:50:46,389 --> 00:50:48,474
Eliot, I'm in trouble.

637
00:50:48,557 --> 00:50:50,684
What kind of trouble?

638
00:50:50,768 --> 00:50:53,187
I cheated on Deanna.

639
00:50:53,896 --> 00:50:55,939
- You never cheated before?
- No.

640
00:50:56,023 --> 00:50:58,901
Everybody cheats.
You know what? Everybody gets over it.

641
00:50:58,942 --> 00:51:01,486
- No, this is different.
- Everybody says that too.

642
00:51:01,569 --> 00:51:04,239
- Don't worry, you'll be fine.
- There's this man...

643
00:51:04,281 --> 00:51:06,367
I don't want to know who it was with.

644
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:09,661
Look, buy Deanna some flowers.
Talk it over with her.

645
00:51:09,744 --> 00:51:11,704
Try not to get caught next time.

646
00:51:11,788 --> 00:51:14,875
Now, for God's sake,
will you help me fix this piece of crap?

647
00:51:17,001 --> 00:51:19,545
I don't often go into the city.

648
00:51:22,632 --> 00:51:25,802
- You think I should?
- Yeah.

649
00:51:28,221 --> 00:51:30,223
Chaz.

650
00:51:31,015 --> 00:51:33,393
- What up, yo?
- Hey.

651
00:51:33,476 --> 00:51:34,936
Ah, man, welcome back.

652
00:51:35,019 --> 00:51:36,104
How long has it been?

653
00:51:36,187 --> 00:51:37,938
High school.

654
00:51:38,021 --> 00:51:39,357
High school.

655
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,943
Man, the best three years
of my life, man.

656
00:51:42,026 --> 00:51:44,152
All the pussy you could imagine,

657
00:51:44,236 --> 00:51:45,946
4.0 GPA,

658
00:51:46,029 --> 00:51:48,574
everything good
till they locked my ass away.

659
00:51:48,658 --> 00:51:50,493
What were you in for?

660
00:51:50,576 --> 00:51:54,204
Me? I was what they call
a recreational drug user.

661
00:51:55,289 --> 00:51:56,248
And that's it?

662
00:51:56,331 --> 00:51:59,543
I was also
a recreational drug distributor.

663
00:51:59,626 --> 00:52:03,255
You know, a little H, some dope, digi.

664
00:52:03,338 --> 00:52:05,007
So how was it?

665
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,842
Man, nothir but the best.

666
00:52:06,925 --> 00:52:09,803
I sold a pure commodity
at a fair market price.

667
00:52:09,886 --> 00:52:11,388
No. Prison.

668
00:52:14,141 --> 00:52:16,601
Prisors like walkir a tightrope.

669
00:52:16,685 --> 00:52:18,478
You try not to get involved.

670
00:52:18,562 --> 00:52:21,230
Actir like you're blind 24 hours a day.

671
00:52:21,314 --> 00:52:24,484
This shit takes
a shitload of concentration.

672
00:52:24,568 --> 00:52:28,404
I mean, when I first got in thatjoint,
man, I was prime meat.

673
00:52:28,487 --> 00:52:31,157
I was what they call unaffiliated.

674
00:52:31,198 --> 00:52:32,618
So, what'd you do?

675
00:52:32,701 --> 00:52:35,786
I got affiliated.

676
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:39,498
I had to stick a shank up in some kid.

677
00:52:39,582 --> 00:52:42,335
What, you killed him?

678
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:44,629
Your back is up against the wall,

679
00:52:44,712 --> 00:52:47,048
and it's you or him,

680
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:49,215
you gotta do what you gotta do.

681
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:11,363
Yeah. This is Charles.

682
00:53:11,446 --> 00:53:14,866
You ever get
a little sidetracked, Charlie?

683
00:53:14,908 --> 00:53:16,993
I need another loan, Charlie.

684
00:53:17,077 --> 00:53:20,372
Now listen. Listen to me.

685
00:53:20,413 --> 00:53:22,707
I've got no more money for you.

686
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:24,918
OK. OK, man. You win.

687
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:27,420
You want me
to leave you alone,

688
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,172
I'll leave you alone.

689
00:53:29,255 --> 00:53:31,674
No problemo.

690
00:53:31,757 --> 00:53:34,886
For $100,000, though.

691
00:53:34,928 --> 00:53:36,388
Fuck you.

692
00:53:36,471 --> 00:53:39,765
Tsk. You ain't that smart.

693
00:53:39,848 --> 00:53:41,350
Anybody ever told you that?

694
00:53:41,433 --> 00:53:42,727
How'd you get this number?

695
00:53:42,811 --> 00:53:45,938
That's it. Keep thinking like that.

696
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:48,649
How did I get your cell number?

697
00:53:48,732 --> 00:53:50,067
It isn't listed, is it?

698
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:51,861
You called my wife.

699
00:53:51,945 --> 00:53:54,571
Ah, no. Guess again.

700
00:53:56,115 --> 00:53:57,950
OK, I'll give you a clue.

701
00:53:58,033 --> 00:54:01,912
On this phone,
it's speed dial number eight.

702
00:54:01,954 --> 00:54:05,249
Hospital one, doctor two.

703
00:54:05,291 --> 00:54:07,458
You're number eight. [laughs]

704
00:54:07,542 --> 00:54:10,170
You don't even rate in the top five.

705
00:54:10,254 --> 00:54:12,256
How does that feel, Charlie?

706
00:54:14,924 --> 00:54:16,384
Oh, Jesus!

707
00:54:42,327 --> 00:54:44,245
Oh, yeah.

708
00:54:44,329 --> 00:54:46,456
Hey! Here's my man.

709
00:54:47,165 --> 00:54:49,250
You OK? You look
like you ran a marathon.

710
00:54:49,334 --> 00:54:50,292
What?

711
00:54:51,126 --> 00:54:53,004
What did you say
to him on the phone?

712
00:54:53,087 --> 00:54:56,840
Well, in our business one has to know
how to light a fire under people.

713
00:54:56,923 --> 00:55:00,135
It's the best way to get things done.
Do you not agree, Charles?

714
00:55:00,177 --> 00:55:02,472
- What's going on here?
- Mr. LaRoche needs you

715
00:55:02,513 --> 00:55:04,765
to sign off on that thing
he called about.

716
00:55:06,141 --> 00:55:07,893
Oh, gosh.

717
00:55:07,976 --> 00:55:11,647
- Did you think I would not come?
- No, I thought you got the message.

718
00:55:13,148 --> 00:55:15,233
I'm sorry. I'm confused.

719
00:55:15,317 --> 00:55:18,235
But you look so out of shape, Charles.

720
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:20,322
Sit down and catch
your breath for a second.

721
00:55:20,405 --> 00:55:23,450
- I'll pour coffee.
- You don't know how many times

722
00:55:23,533 --> 00:55:25,409
- I told him to join my tennis club.
- What?

723
00:55:25,493 --> 00:55:28,997
You know Charles. He prefers
to follow sports, not play them.

724
00:55:29,081 --> 00:55:31,249
But one has
to keep fit in today's world

725
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:34,585
'cause you never know when you'll
need to be at your fighting best.

726
00:55:34,669 --> 00:55:36,587
Please.

727
00:55:36,671 --> 00:55:39,383
He's right. You might have
been able to outrun that mugger.

728
00:55:39,466 --> 00:55:42,301
Oh. Well, from what Charles told me,

729
00:55:42,385 --> 00:55:45,429
that thug had a jump on him
from the very start.

730
00:55:45,514 --> 00:55:48,099
This is crazy.
You never had a chance, did you?

731
00:55:48,182 --> 00:55:49,350
I'm gonna get him back.

732
00:55:49,392 --> 00:55:52,478
You're not getting anyone back.
You have a family.

733
00:55:52,561 --> 00:55:54,271
You're so right, Deanna, so right.

734
00:55:54,355 --> 00:55:57,984
You wanna protect your family
'cause at the end of the day,

735
00:55:58,025 --> 00:56:00,653
this is the most important thing
in the whole world.

736
00:56:02,404 --> 00:56:05,116
- Mom, have you seen my sketchbook?
- Get back upstairs.

737
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:06,867
- Go do your homework.
- Charles.

738
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:10,203
Amy, this is Mr. LaRoche.
He works with your father.

739
00:56:10,829 --> 00:56:14,208
Come here, beauty.

740
00:56:20,463 --> 00:56:24,509
It means, "like a little stone
that's rolling down the river."

741
00:56:24,592 --> 00:56:26,219
So cute.

742
00:56:26,303 --> 00:56:28,388
- May I kiss you?
- Mm-hm.

743
00:56:29,931 --> 00:56:32,350
You know,
we were looking at your drawings.

744
00:56:32,434 --> 00:56:34,311
They're lovely. Truly beautiful.

745
00:56:34,394 --> 00:56:36,062
Thank you.

746
00:56:36,104 --> 00:56:37,896
Such a talent.

747
00:56:37,938 --> 00:56:40,609
You know, when I first came
to this beautiful country,

748
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:43,528
I spent quite a lot
of time in New York.

749
00:56:43,612 --> 00:56:45,237
And if you allow me, of course,

750
00:56:45,279 --> 00:56:48,450
I could show these
to some very prominent art dealers.

751
00:56:48,533 --> 00:56:49,743
That sounds great.

752
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:51,827
How about we go sign off
on this contract?

753
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:54,204
Oh, yes, business is business,
of course.

754
00:56:54,288 --> 00:56:55,623
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

755
00:56:56,791 --> 00:56:59,251
Whoop!

756
00:57:00,628 --> 00:57:02,046
She's so cute.

757
00:57:02,087 --> 00:57:03,380
I'll be up soon, honey.

758
00:57:03,464 --> 00:57:05,133
How old is she?

759
00:57:07,551 --> 00:57:10,929
- You get the fuck out of my house.
- What did you say?

760
00:57:11,013 --> 00:57:13,556
- Get out.
- I beg your pardon.

761
00:57:15,768 --> 00:57:16,936
What'd you say?

762
00:57:17,019 --> 00:57:19,438
Ooh.

763
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,564
You don't like that, huh?

764
00:57:22,942 --> 00:57:26,736
You upper-crust motherfucker. Huh?

765
00:57:27,654 --> 00:57:31,784
You got it all, and yet you're ready
to fuck it up forjust a bit of pussy?

766
00:57:31,867 --> 00:57:33,327
- Fuck...
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

767
00:57:34,786 --> 00:57:36,079
A hundred...

768
00:57:36,162 --> 00:57:38,623
A hundred thousand dollars,

769
00:57:38,706 --> 00:57:42,210
and I just might
give you back your balls, bitch.

770
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:43,670
You hear me?

771
00:57:43,753 --> 00:57:46,422
Say it. OK? OK?

772
00:57:46,464 --> 00:57:48,632
Yeah, nice boy.

773
00:57:50,635 --> 00:57:53,596
OK... OK.

774
00:57:53,638 --> 00:57:57,432
Well... au revoir. Thanks for having me.

775
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,937
- Au revoir.
- I'll see you soon. Bye.

776
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,731
He seems like a lovely guy.

777
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:06,901
Why didn't you call me
when this whole thing began?

778
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:08,569
Why didn't you call me
when this whole thing began?

779
00:58:08,653 --> 00:58:10,779
I'm supposed
to be your first call, Charles.

780
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:13,115
I don't need a lecture,
I need to know my options.

781
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,825
Look, she's gotta come forward.

782
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,536
I told you, she can't do that.

783
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:19,913
- We need a statement on the record.
- Jerry, he was in my house.

784
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:21,456
With my family.

785
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,500
He didn't break in.
He didn't touch them.

786
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,461
- He didn't threaten them.
- Jerry. He broke my nose.

787
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,088
OK, show me the police report.

788
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,590
Did you go to the police
when you got beat?

789
00:58:31,465 --> 00:58:33,135
So...

790
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,679
So you've done nothing
about this for six weeks,

791
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,098
and now suddenly you want me
to file a complaint?

792
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:40,141
You've got to get her to come forward.

793
00:58:40,182 --> 00:58:43,437
Anything else is just...
pissing in the wind.

794
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,813
- What are you doing here?
- I spoke to my lawyer.

795
00:58:45,896 --> 00:58:48,649
- We have to go to the police.
- We can't go to the police.

796
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:49,984
Listen to me.

797
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:53,029
- We didn't sleep together.
- It's the same thing.

798
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:56,032
Because we didn't fuck
doesn't mean we didn't cross the line.

799
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:58,075
We went to the hotel.
We started to do it.

800
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:01,078
And we didn't stop
out of the conscience of our hearts.

801
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:02,997
Exactly. We were attacked.

802
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,338
I had an abortion, Charles.

803
00:59:10,921 --> 00:59:11,964
What?

804
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,386
Why didn't you tell me?

805
00:59:19,972 --> 00:59:22,599
I... I could have helped.
I could have done something.

806
00:59:22,682 --> 00:59:24,643
Done what, Charles?

807
00:59:25,727 --> 00:59:28,313
What could you have done?

808
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,486
Oh! Snap his back, man!

809
00:59:34,569 --> 00:59:36,821
Smack him!
Referee, that's a penalty!

810
00:59:38,907 --> 00:59:42,409
Sorry, you know I get zoned
to this hockey shit, Chaz, man.

811
00:59:42,493 --> 00:59:44,037
OK, I'm listening.

812
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,289
So, what do you think I should do?

813
00:59:46,373 --> 00:59:49,583
Shit, I don't know, man.
But you see how it works, though, right?

814
00:59:49,667 --> 00:59:54,130
He lures you in with 20 grand. Folks
like you could pull together 20 grand

815
00:59:54,214 --> 00:59:55,548
if you had to, right?

816
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:58,842
You think, 20 grand,
bong, and he's gone, right?

817
00:59:58,926 --> 01:00:00,970
Nah. It's not about that.

818
01:00:01,054 --> 01:00:03,473
He wanna see if you're
the kind of asshole who pays.

819
01:00:03,556 --> 01:00:05,808
Then after that...

820
01:00:05,891 --> 01:00:09,603
...slap the big dick on you, hit you
for the real cheese, the big bucks.

821
01:00:09,687 --> 01:00:11,897
That's what this game
is all about, Chaz.

822
01:00:11,939 --> 01:00:13,857
Thanks, Winston,
I feel much better now.

823
01:00:13,941 --> 01:00:16,277
You're a wild cowboy, yo.

824
01:00:18,444 --> 01:00:20,072
Well, can you pay him?

825
01:00:20,781 --> 01:00:23,075
Technically, yeah, I have the money.

826
01:00:23,158 --> 01:00:25,410
Shit, yo, so pay him,
man, be done with this.

827
01:00:25,493 --> 01:00:27,579
I can't. It's put away
for something else.

828
01:00:27,663 --> 01:00:29,707
It's years of savings. Can't touch it.

829
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:32,667
I don't know what to do.
I'm going out of my fuckir mind here.

830
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:35,378
- It's there everywhere I turn.
- Calm down, Chaz.

831
01:00:35,461 --> 01:00:37,381
Look, man, drink your beer.

832
01:00:38,841 --> 01:00:41,259
Shit, that ain't even
strong enough right now.

833
01:00:41,342 --> 01:00:44,387
O'Malley, let us get
a double Scotch and hold the rocks.

834
01:00:46,015 --> 01:00:47,307
Let me tell you something.

835
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:50,768
I spent five years in the joint
with motherfuckers like this.

836
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:54,439
The first thing you must understand
about a rapist is that they pussies.

837
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,357
They weak. They prey on the weak.

838
01:00:56,441 --> 01:00:58,067
So, what do you think I should do?

839
01:00:58,151 --> 01:01:02,112
Listen, man, I like you,

840
01:01:02,195 --> 01:01:04,449
'cause you're different
than the rest of them.

841
01:01:04,532 --> 01:01:06,951
I don't like to see you
in no position like this.

842
01:01:06,993 --> 01:01:08,452
So I'm gonna do you a solid.

843
01:01:08,535 --> 01:01:10,996
I'm gonna scare this pussy
off your back for you.

844
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:13,583
- No. No, no, no.
- Listen, I owe you.

845
01:01:13,666 --> 01:01:15,834
You caught me stealir those computers,

846
01:01:15,917 --> 01:01:17,377
you coulda dropped a dime on me,

847
01:01:17,461 --> 01:01:19,588
I'd have been locked up
for three more years.

848
01:01:19,671 --> 01:01:23,050
- Winston, you owe me nothing.
- Look at it this way then.

849
01:01:23,133 --> 01:01:24,927
Let's make it a business proposition.

850
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:27,471
Instead of you giving
this motherfucker 100K,

851
01:01:27,512 --> 01:01:30,307
you could pay me, say, ten percent?

852
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:32,976
Yeah, $10,000 in cash,

853
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:36,605
and I'll scare that Pepé Le Pew
motherfucker all the way back to France.

854
01:01:40,734 --> 01:01:43,153
Hurry up.

855
01:01:43,195 --> 01:01:46,949
- Thank you!
- Happy birthday.

856
01:01:49,576 --> 01:01:51,118
Look at this one.

857
01:01:51,202 --> 01:01:54,997
- That's nail polish.
- Nail polish? Is it?

858
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:56,750
Yeah.

859
01:01:56,833 --> 01:01:59,043
- What's that one?
- Here.

860
01:02:06,634 --> 01:02:08,344
Oh, it's beautiful.

861
01:02:10,554 --> 01:02:11,639
Oh, thank you.

862
01:02:25,569 --> 01:02:27,112
Thank you. Goodbye.

863
01:02:28,613 --> 01:02:31,534
Charles, this just came in for you.

864
01:02:40,084 --> 01:02:42,085
Does it involve fast cars?

865
01:02:42,168 --> 01:02:44,546
Yeah,
fast cars, all the good things.

866
01:02:44,629 --> 01:02:48,466
- We'll see you tonight.
- Yeah. Bye-bye, pretty girls.

867
01:02:49,759 --> 01:02:52,554
Good morning, JMD/March.

868
01:02:52,596 --> 01:02:54,681
No, I'm sorry. That's OK.

869
01:02:54,764 --> 01:02:57,726
OK, no problem. Goodbye.

870
01:02:57,767 --> 01:02:59,352
- Yeah?
- Barry. It's me.

871
01:02:59,436 --> 01:03:02,147
I need a cash check
for this aspirin spot.

872
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:03,397
Another one?

873
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,234
- How much you want this time?
- Ten thousand.

874
01:03:06,276 --> 01:03:09,237
You come down here,
and you sign for it yourself, yeah?

875
01:03:09,279 --> 01:03:10,321
Thanks.

876
01:03:10,404 --> 01:03:11,739
Hey, yo, Chaz.

877
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:14,575
You know what my favorite song is?

878
01:03:14,617 --> 01:03:18,412
"Get Money." B.I.G. and Lil' Kim.

879
01:03:18,454 --> 01:03:19,747
My favorite artists?

880
01:03:19,788 --> 01:03:22,666
Eddie Money, Al Green

881
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:25,711
and Johnny motherfuckir Cash, baby.

882
01:03:25,794 --> 01:03:27,922
Oh, let me tell you
my favorite reverends.

883
01:03:27,963 --> 01:03:33,218
- Frederick Price and Creflo Dollar.
- Yes, Winston, I have your money.

884
01:03:33,302 --> 01:03:35,262
Who's talkir money here, Chaz?

885
01:03:35,346 --> 01:03:37,389
Just tryir to make conversation, man.

886
01:03:37,473 --> 01:03:39,766
- You OK, Chaz?
- Yeah.

887
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:44,396
Let me turn this up for you, baby,
get a crack on this motherfucker.

888
01:04:02,497 --> 01:04:04,749
Uh-oh. Ching-ching.

889
01:04:07,334 --> 01:04:09,420
Love the smell of fresh money, yo.

890
01:04:11,631 --> 01:04:14,007
Jesus.

891
01:04:14,091 --> 01:04:15,550
You're gonna shoot him?

892
01:04:15,634 --> 01:04:18,972
I ain't gonna shoot him. I'm gonna
scare his monkey-ass off your back.

893
01:04:19,013 --> 01:04:20,515
It's not even loaded.

894
01:04:20,598 --> 01:04:23,600
But it's like
an old gangsta proverb, yo.

895
01:04:23,684 --> 01:04:27,146
You ain't gotta use force,
but you gotta project strength.

896
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:29,815
Project strength. Right.

897
01:04:29,898 --> 01:04:32,943
- Got it.
- Chaz, my good buddy,

898
01:04:33,026 --> 01:04:36,113
it's time you got affiliated, man.
Come on, take that.

899
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:38,657
Is this the one you used...?

900
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:41,159
That's the one, yo.
That's for good luck.

901
01:04:41,201 --> 01:04:44,663
I'm gonna run inside this joint first,
scope it out.

902
01:04:44,705 --> 01:04:47,040
When you feel comfortable,
you come on in.

903
01:04:47,124 --> 01:04:49,875
We got maybe a hour
before this bastard shows up.

904
01:04:49,959 --> 01:04:51,837
You're gonna be close, though, right?

905
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,339
I'm gonna be close.
Don't worry. I got your back.

906
01:04:54,381 --> 01:04:56,008
It's like in the movies and shit,

907
01:04:56,091 --> 01:04:58,551
the bad guy
is always one step ahead, right?

908
01:04:58,634 --> 01:05:02,014
So we gotta be two steps ahead
of this crazy motherfucker...

909
01:05:07,727 --> 01:05:09,270
Charlie...

910
01:05:10,522 --> 01:05:11,480
Charlie.

911
01:05:12,773 --> 01:05:14,650
This doesn't look like 100 to me.

912
01:05:14,734 --> 01:05:17,445
God almighty. You killed him.

913
01:05:17,528 --> 01:05:19,488
You brought him,
you fuckir piece of shit,

914
01:05:19,572 --> 01:05:22,074
and this isn't good
for our relationship.

915
01:05:35,922 --> 01:05:37,006
Oh, Jesus.

916
01:05:44,387 --> 01:05:46,557
- Asshole!
- Fuck you!

917
01:05:46,598 --> 01:05:49,392
You coulda been coming
instead of going!

918
01:05:51,353 --> 01:05:53,063
Want a date, hon?

919
01:05:53,104 --> 01:05:56,358
Hey, you. You by the car.

920
01:05:56,441 --> 01:05:57,817
You lookir?

921
01:05:57,901 --> 01:06:00,403
No. No, I-I'm fine.

922
01:06:00,487 --> 01:06:02,071
What about him?

923
01:06:02,154 --> 01:06:04,157
Maybe he wants a date.

924
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,159
I don't think so.

925
01:06:06,993 --> 01:06:09,995
What's wrong with him? He drunk?

926
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:12,874
Yeah. Yeah, he's... he's drunk, OK.

927
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:14,918
You got a light?

928
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,043
I... I don't smoke.

929
01:06:16,126 --> 01:06:19,088
You don't smoke, you don't drink,

930
01:06:19,129 --> 01:06:22,716
you don't fuck. What do you do?

931
01:06:24,468 --> 01:06:27,263
- Get outta here.
- What? Hey, screw you!

932
01:06:27,346 --> 01:06:29,682
Don't tell me to get outta nowhere.

933
01:06:29,765 --> 01:06:32,184
- What's up, Candy?
- Hey, Joe.

934
01:06:32,268 --> 01:06:33,435
Hey, Candy.

935
01:06:33,477 --> 01:06:36,771
- Keepir safe?
- You know me.

936
01:06:36,813 --> 01:06:39,900
I'm careful these days.

937
01:06:39,984 --> 01:06:43,820
Hey, you! Conducting
a transaction with Candy here?

938
01:06:43,903 --> 01:06:45,905
- No, officer...
- No?

939
01:06:45,989 --> 01:06:48,409
What? Something wrong with her?

940
01:06:48,492 --> 01:06:51,452
- No, she's great.
- Great, huh?

941
01:06:54,622 --> 01:06:56,709
- You married?
- Yes.

942
01:06:56,792 --> 01:06:59,127
Your old lady know
you're trolling for hookers?

943
01:06:59,168 --> 01:07:02,964
- I-I'm not. Look...
- How 'bout your buddy? He married?

944
01:07:03,631 --> 01:07:04,592
He's drunk.

945
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:08,553
If he's drunk,
what's he doing behind the wheel?

946
01:07:08,636 --> 01:07:10,597
Hey, buddy! Hey, you there!

947
01:07:10,638 --> 01:07:11,973
He's sleeping it off, sir.

948
01:07:15,351 --> 01:07:18,146
The two of you were out trolling
for hookers on a Wednesday,

949
01:07:18,187 --> 01:07:20,814
and neither of you were
doing business with Candy here.

950
01:07:21,774 --> 01:07:23,901
- I'm sorry, I...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

951
01:07:23,985 --> 01:07:25,903
Don't apologize to me.

952
01:07:25,987 --> 01:07:27,321
Tell her you're sorry.

953
01:07:27,362 --> 01:07:28,947
Freezir her ass off out here,

954
01:07:29,031 --> 01:07:32,201
and you two jokers
don't even give her the time of day.

955
01:07:41,877 --> 01:07:43,962
I'm sorry, ma'am.

956
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,132
We'll call it a deposit. Huh?

957
01:07:48,592 --> 01:07:49,927
Believe this guy?

958
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:52,971
- We're on the clock.
- We're gonna circle the block.

959
01:07:53,055 --> 01:07:54,640
I come back and you're still here,

960
01:07:54,681 --> 01:07:56,850
I'm gonna take you and your buddy in.

961
01:07:56,934 --> 01:07:59,645
- See ya, Candy.
- Take it easy, Candy.

962
01:07:59,686 --> 01:08:01,104
See ya, Joe.

963
01:10:19,155 --> 01:10:22,992
I'm tired of you, Charles. I
need that receipt for the aspirin spot.

964
01:10:23,076 --> 01:10:25,202
- I said you'll get it today, you will.
- Today?

965
01:10:25,285 --> 01:10:26,495
Yes. Lunchtime.

966
01:10:26,578 --> 01:10:28,206
- Well, you better...
- Oh, shit!

967
01:10:29,707 --> 01:10:31,751
You OK?

968
01:10:31,834 --> 01:10:35,003
Folks in the mailroom
asked me to bring this up to you.

969
01:10:35,087 --> 01:10:36,839
Franklin Church. Chicago P.D.

970
01:10:36,923 --> 01:10:38,675
- Where is...?
- Winston?

971
01:10:40,425 --> 01:10:42,344
He was murdered last night.

972
01:10:42,386 --> 01:10:43,971
- What'd you say?
- That's right.

973
01:10:44,054 --> 01:10:45,515
Midnight, under the highway.

974
01:10:45,598 --> 01:10:47,641
Killer tried to dump him in the river.

975
01:10:47,724 --> 01:10:48,767
Jesus.

976
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,729
I...

977
01:10:53,939 --> 01:10:55,399
Jesu...

978
01:10:56,316 --> 01:11:00,570
- I liked Winston. We were friends.
- Yeah. I liked him too.

979
01:11:00,654 --> 01:11:02,698
We were like brothers.

980
01:11:02,781 --> 01:11:05,867
He's... Well, he was
sort of a relative of mine.

981
01:11:05,951 --> 01:11:08,286
- Are you the baseball stats guy?
- Yeah.

982
01:11:08,369 --> 01:11:10,831
Yeah, that's me. Baseball freak.

983
01:11:10,914 --> 01:11:13,792
Even played in the minors '79 to '82.

984
01:11:15,459 --> 01:11:18,796
You know,
I see these losers every day.

985
01:11:20,007 --> 01:11:23,509
Dopers. Crooks. Gangbangers.

986
01:11:23,593 --> 01:11:25,886
Law doesn't care much
for losers like that.

987
01:11:27,597 --> 01:11:30,558
Winston was different.
He coulda got out.

988
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,184
The brother was no loser.

989
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:34,020
I'm sorry.

990
01:11:36,230 --> 01:11:38,566
- You own a gun, Mr. Schine?
- No.

991
01:11:38,649 --> 01:11:40,693
Smith & Wesson 5906?

992
01:11:40,776 --> 01:11:42,862
What, you think I did this?

993
01:11:42,945 --> 01:11:45,488
Oh, no, of course not.

994
01:11:45,572 --> 01:11:48,910
But we have to ask everybody.
I mean, you know how it is.

995
01:11:48,951 --> 01:11:50,536
So where were you last night?

996
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:53,079
Here. Work. I was at work.

997
01:11:53,163 --> 01:11:56,667
Anyone... with you corroborate that?

998
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,839
- Do you mind?
- No. No, no, I'll wait.

999
01:12:03,925 --> 01:12:04,926
Yeah.

1000
01:12:05,009 --> 01:12:07,928
What did you think?
You could fuck with me,

1001
01:12:07,969 --> 01:12:10,972
- you miserable piece of shit? Huh?
- No.

1002
01:12:11,056 --> 01:12:13,308
I've got your girl here.

1003
01:12:13,391 --> 01:12:16,353
Do you understand me?
I've got your little whore right here.

1004
01:12:16,436 --> 01:12:21,106
- Oh, God. Stop, please...
- Where are you?

1005
01:12:21,149 --> 01:12:23,151
Shut the fuck up Dex, take care of her.

1006
01:12:23,234 --> 01:12:24,277
No problem.

1007
01:12:24,361 --> 01:12:27,655
I don't like killing,
but if you're not here in 20 minutes,

1008
01:12:27,738 --> 01:12:29,865
- I'm gonna put a bullet in her brain.
- Don't.

1009
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:32,994
And then one in Deanna.
And sweet little Amy too.

1010
01:12:33,078 --> 01:12:35,621
I'm gonna kill all your women,
do you understand?

1011
01:12:35,704 --> 01:12:39,000
It was a mistake, a big mistake.
I'm ready to do what you ask now.

1012
01:12:39,084 --> 01:12:40,585
Do you have my 100,000?

1013
01:12:40,669 --> 01:12:42,628
Yeah, yeah, I do.
I mean, I will. Just...

1014
01:12:42,711 --> 01:12:44,380
Just tell me how to get there.

1015
01:12:44,463 --> 01:12:47,883
- Uh-huh, 55 East Erie, apartment 4010.
- Got it.

1016
01:12:47,967 --> 01:12:50,427
Twenty minutes, Charlie.
Next time I visit your wife

1017
01:12:50,511 --> 01:12:52,388
it ain't gonna be for a cup of coffee.

1018
01:12:52,471 --> 01:12:53,847
Thank you very much.

1019
01:12:56,099 --> 01:13:00,604
- Is there a problem?
- I'm sorry. I have... I gotta go.

1020
01:13:02,313 --> 01:13:05,567
I have a meeting. I'll call you.

1021
01:13:06,652 --> 01:13:11,281
10, 20, 30, 40, 50,

1022
01:13:11,322 --> 01:13:17,078
60, 70, 80, 90, 100,000.

1023
01:13:17,161 --> 01:13:20,915
Are you sure you want to carry
all this out with you, Mr. Schine?

1024
01:13:20,999 --> 01:13:22,208
Yeah.

1025
01:13:39,808 --> 01:13:43,521
What's up, Charles? Come on.

1026
01:13:59,411 --> 01:14:02,414
Come on in. Don't be scared.

1027
01:14:08,962 --> 01:14:10,005
Way!

1028
01:14:11,131 --> 01:14:14,675
Dex. You think I should count this,
or... just trust him?

1029
01:14:14,759 --> 01:14:16,803
Sure. Why not?

1030
01:14:16,887 --> 01:14:19,181
He looks like a trustable guy.

1031
01:14:19,222 --> 01:14:21,349
You fucking move, I'll kill you, bitch!

1032
01:14:25,562 --> 01:14:26,897
One motherfucking.

1033
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:28,397
Two motherfucking.

1034
01:14:28,439 --> 01:14:29,690
Three.

1035
01:14:29,774 --> 01:14:31,859
- I gave you the money!
- What?

1036
01:14:31,943 --> 01:14:35,279
No, you didn't give me the money.
You fucking made me kill for it.

1037
01:14:37,615 --> 01:14:39,909
Keep something in mind, Charles.

1038
01:14:39,992 --> 01:14:42,578
I'll always be one step ahead of you.

1039
01:14:42,662 --> 01:14:44,080
Always.

1040
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,960
Well, my dear Dexter,

1041
01:14:50,043 --> 01:14:52,421
I think it's time to relocate.

1042
01:14:52,505 --> 01:14:55,258
Yeah. Relocate.

1043
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:58,385
- Au revoir.
- Mm-hm.

1044
01:15:00,137 --> 01:15:02,265
Congratulations, Charlie.

1045
01:15:02,348 --> 01:15:04,766
You just bought your life back.

1046
01:15:18,613 --> 01:15:20,865
Are you OK?

1047
01:15:22,492 --> 01:15:24,744
I don't even...

1048
01:15:24,828 --> 01:15:26,371
They must have just followed me.

1049
01:15:26,454 --> 01:15:29,749
I didn't even... I don't know...
They just... pushed their way in.

1050
01:15:29,833 --> 01:15:31,251
It's OK now.

1051
01:15:36,548 --> 01:15:40,092
- Are you sure that they're gone?
- He's gone.

1052
01:15:40,175 --> 01:15:41,427
I paid him.

1053
01:15:44,514 --> 01:15:46,099
I paid him everything.

1054
01:15:49,184 --> 01:15:50,477
But your daughter...

1055
01:15:55,566 --> 01:15:56,775
I'm sorry.

1056
01:15:57,902 --> 01:15:59,278
I'm so sorry.

1057
01:15:59,987 --> 01:16:02,573
- I should have...
- I think it's over now.

1058
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,453
You're safe.

1059
01:16:08,453 --> 01:16:10,414
My family's safe.

1060
01:16:45,531 --> 01:16:47,116
Hello?

1061
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,745
Charles, is that you? Hello?

1062
01:17:09,346 --> 01:17:11,390
- See you, Sean.
- See ya.

1063
01:17:11,473 --> 01:17:12,933
Take care, guys.

1064
01:17:22,401 --> 01:17:24,528
You're a hard man to track down.

1065
01:17:25,904 --> 01:17:29,115
You're not at work,
you're not at home...

1066
01:17:30,742 --> 01:17:33,995
This is where all you bored executive
types go to drown your sorrows.

1067
01:17:34,078 --> 01:17:36,205
I've been meaning to call you.

1068
01:17:36,247 --> 01:17:38,207
I'm sure.

1069
01:17:38,249 --> 01:17:40,210
You know, ever since he was a kid,

1070
01:17:40,252 --> 01:17:42,336
Winston never could
seem to catch a break.

1071
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:44,255
You know who
he always reminded me of?

1072
01:17:44,338 --> 01:17:46,591
Bobby Bonds.

1073
01:17:46,674 --> 01:17:49,427
Unluckiest player
to ever step up to the plate.

1074
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:53,264
Bobby Bonds struck out
187 times in 1969,

1075
01:17:53,347 --> 01:17:56,142
more than any other player
in a single season,

1076
01:17:56,225 --> 01:17:58,811
except one.

1077
01:17:58,895 --> 01:18:00,271
You know who?

1078
01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:05,526
- Bobby Bonds.
- Bobby Bonds.

1079
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:08,446
Following year. 189 strikeouts.

1080
01:18:09,113 --> 01:18:10,155
Now, that's unlucky.

1081
01:18:13,033 --> 01:18:15,578
This is my new buddy.
Sean owns this place.

1082
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:18,872
- Hey, Sean, Scotch. Drop the rocks.
- Coming up, Frank.

1083
01:18:18,955 --> 01:18:21,708
Sean says you and Winston
had a drink here recently.

1084
01:18:21,791 --> 01:18:23,960
Mind telling me
what you were talking about?

1085
01:18:25,045 --> 01:18:28,298
- Hockey.
- Hockey. That's it?

1086
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:30,133
There was a game on.

1087
01:18:30,216 --> 01:18:33,178
Now, I still need to know
where you were last night.

1088
01:18:33,261 --> 01:18:35,221
I told ya. I was working.

1089
01:18:35,305 --> 01:18:38,474
- No one at your office can confirm.
- I was alone.

1090
01:18:39,975 --> 01:18:41,311
OK, Mr. Schine.

1091
01:18:41,978 --> 01:18:45,397
Maybe you'd be more comfortable
talking to me with your lawyer.

1092
01:18:45,481 --> 01:18:48,400
Why don't the two of you
come by my office tomorrow morning?

1093
01:18:48,484 --> 01:18:49,945
And just so you know,

1094
01:18:51,321 --> 01:18:55,366
I'm gonna crucify
the son of a bitch who killed Winston.

1095
01:19:04,333 --> 01:19:06,835
- See ya, Sean.
- Detective.

1096
01:19:20,307 --> 01:19:21,307
Charles?

1097
01:19:28,815 --> 01:19:29,941
Amy sleeping?

1098
01:19:30,024 --> 01:19:31,526
Yeah.

1099
01:19:36,614 --> 01:19:39,784
I've made a horrible mistake, Dee.

1100
01:19:50,503 --> 01:19:53,381
The money we put away for Amy...

1101
01:19:56,717 --> 01:19:58,260
...it's gone.

1102
01:19:59,637 --> 01:20:02,599
- Gone?
- All of it.

1103
01:20:03,557 --> 01:20:05,058
What are you talking about?

1104
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:08,187
- I'm so sorry.
- Well, where is it? Where is the money?

1105
01:20:08,229 --> 01:20:11,189
- I'll figure it out.
- Figure out what? What's going on?

1106
01:20:11,231 --> 01:20:13,775
- I'll find a way.
- What have you done?

1107
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:17,071
Tell me what you've done.

1108
01:20:22,576 --> 01:20:25,411
Seven years of savings.

1109
01:20:25,494 --> 01:20:29,374
- You fucking explain yourself!
- I'll tell you, Dee.

1110
01:20:29,416 --> 01:20:31,418
I'll tell you everything.

1111
01:20:32,919 --> 01:20:35,797
And it's notjust about the money.

1112
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:43,430
Ah. Come on, we're late.

1113
01:20:43,513 --> 01:20:45,265
I have to tell Lucinda first, Jerry.

1114
01:20:45,307 --> 01:20:48,184
No. I've called this detective
twice already this morning.

1115
01:20:48,267 --> 01:20:49,852
- He's a real hard-ass.
- I have to.

1116
01:20:50,686 --> 01:20:53,981
- You think this guy is fuckir around?
- I'll meet you down there.

1117
01:20:54,065 --> 01:20:56,275
- So, what am I supposed to tell them?
- Help me.

1118
01:20:56,317 --> 01:20:57,318
Charles!

1119
01:20:58,611 --> 01:21:01,447
- Lucinda Harris, please.
- She's not in her office.

1120
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:03,824
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, wait. Here she comes now.

1121
01:21:06,077 --> 01:21:09,537
- No. No, no, no. Lucinda Harris.
- Yeah?

1122
01:21:11,082 --> 01:21:13,584
No, you saw us here. Together.

1123
01:21:13,668 --> 01:21:15,961
- Twice. Remember?
- I saw you with her temp.

1124
01:21:16,044 --> 01:21:17,963
- Temp?
- Sure. You know,

1125
01:21:18,004 --> 01:21:20,174
answered her phones occasionally,

1126
01:21:20,258 --> 01:21:23,927
took long lunches, always late. A temp.

1127
01:21:23,969 --> 01:21:26,388
Jane something. She quit last week.

1128
01:21:34,813 --> 01:21:37,065
I'm a financial advisor.

1129
01:21:37,148 --> 01:21:39,276
I cheat clients.

1130
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:52,371
And it comes fully furnished,
just like you see.

1131
01:21:52,454 --> 01:21:54,874
What we call our lived-in look.

1132
01:21:56,042 --> 01:21:58,419
- May I help you, sir?
- Is this place for rent?

1133
01:21:58,502 --> 01:22:00,629
Yes, would you like a brochure?

1134
01:22:00,671 --> 01:22:02,298
It was rented. I was here.

1135
01:22:02,339 --> 01:22:04,925
Well, it's available again now.
Are you interested?

1136
01:22:05,009 --> 01:22:06,343
You rented it to a woman.

1137
01:22:06,385 --> 01:22:08,971
No, no, it was a couple.
A woman and her boyfriend.

1138
01:22:09,013 --> 01:22:11,516
They left unexpectedly.
Very nice couple.

1139
01:22:11,558 --> 01:22:13,392
You know them?

1140
01:22:13,475 --> 01:22:15,978
They make it
all won'th it, don't they?

1141
01:22:16,061 --> 01:22:17,938
Yes.

1142
01:22:18,022 --> 01:22:19,564
I do.

1143
01:22:30,034 --> 01:22:32,202
This is the end of the Red Line.

1144
01:22:32,244 --> 01:22:35,163
All passengers please
disembark at this time.

1145
01:22:35,204 --> 01:22:36,873
Thank you.

1146
01:22:36,915 --> 01:22:39,460
The train on platform two

1147
01:22:39,543 --> 01:22:43,588
is the Blue Line from Cottage Gate.
This is our final destination.

1148
01:22:43,671 --> 01:22:46,926
All passengers please
disembark at this time.

1149
01:22:47,009 --> 01:22:49,260
Thank you.

1150
01:22:59,729 --> 01:23:03,565
- Hey. I'm sorry. Are you OK?
- Yes. Good.

1151
01:23:03,649 --> 01:23:05,902
I have to run,
I have a breakfast meeting.

1152
01:23:05,985 --> 01:23:07,820
- You do.
- Will you call me?

1153
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:09,988
I will. I'll call you very soon.

1154
01:23:10,072 --> 01:23:11,949
- You promise?
- I promise.

1155
01:23:12,032 --> 01:23:15,578
- I gotta go. See you later.
- OK. See you.

1156
01:23:15,662 --> 01:23:16,995
Bye-bye!

1157
01:23:40,102 --> 01:23:42,688
- What?
- I'd like to get into the car.

1158
01:23:42,771 --> 01:23:46,607
- Half an hour!
- Oh! Half an hour?

1159
01:23:47,275 --> 01:23:49,486
- You're sorry?
- I promise.

1160
01:23:57,159 --> 01:23:59,120
May I?

1161
01:23:59,161 --> 01:24:01,080
Thank you.

1162
01:24:01,872 --> 01:24:04,208
- Hey, Dex!
- Yo, Frenchie!

1163
01:24:04,292 --> 01:24:05,918
We outta here.

1164
01:24:16,804 --> 01:24:19,140
I want a room.

1165
01:24:19,181 --> 01:24:20,932
Top floor.

1166
01:24:34,988 --> 01:24:36,364
- Charles.
- Jerry.

1167
01:24:36,448 --> 01:24:39,576
Good. So I talked with this detective.
He's got nothing on you.

1168
01:24:39,659 --> 01:24:41,161
- He's just fishing.
- Thanks.

1169
01:24:41,244 --> 01:24:44,748
Tell him everything.
It's the only way out of this.

1170
01:24:44,831 --> 01:24:47,751
What happens
to Amy's money if they find him?

1171
01:24:47,834 --> 01:24:50,670
- It's gonna be state's evidence.
- And I never see it again?

1172
01:24:50,754 --> 01:24:53,632
No, I have to take care of this myself.
It's the only way.

1173
01:24:53,673 --> 01:24:55,342
What are you talking about?

1174
01:24:55,425 --> 01:24:57,760
Jerry,
I have to get Amy's money back.

1175
01:24:57,843 --> 01:25:01,097
Charles, wait. Charles...

1176
01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:28,374
- Uh, hi. I-I'd like a room, please.
- Forty-six dollars a night.

1177
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:34,713
You wanna use the hotel safe?

1178
01:25:34,797 --> 01:25:36,215
Uh, no, thank you.

1179
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:14,377
Um...

1180
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:16,420
I think it's this way.

1181
01:28:22,878 --> 01:28:24,545
Hey!

1182
01:28:24,587 --> 01:28:25,838
Hey, what's going on?

1183
01:28:27,047 --> 01:28:29,675
You can have my money.
My wallet's on the table. Take it.

1184
01:28:31,635 --> 01:28:33,846
I don't want your money. They do.

1185
01:28:34,638 --> 01:28:37,057
They want it all. You're in a scam.

1186
01:28:37,141 --> 01:28:39,685
- What?
- A con.

1187
01:28:39,768 --> 01:28:42,438
These two were gonna take you
for everything you've got.

1188
01:28:44,398 --> 01:28:47,191
I don't know what you're talking about.

1189
01:28:47,233 --> 01:28:48,861
Who are you, and what do you want?

1190
01:28:52,864 --> 01:28:54,365
You met on the train, did you?

1191
01:28:56,117 --> 01:28:58,370
By accident. Just happened somehow.

1192
01:29:00,914 --> 01:29:02,749
And she was fuckir sweet...

1193
01:29:03,499 --> 01:29:04,542
...and smart...

1194
01:29:06,419 --> 01:29:09,422
...and you couldn't believe
how attracted she was to you.

1195
01:29:10,673 --> 01:29:13,425
She was just too good to be true.

1196
01:29:15,053 --> 01:29:17,931
She showed you this picture
of her daughter.

1197
01:29:19,432 --> 01:29:23,436
Everything this bitch
told you was a lie.

1198
01:29:23,519 --> 01:29:26,022
Not everything was a lie, Charles.

1199
01:29:26,105 --> 01:29:29,816
He was just about to rob you,
and then rape her.

1200
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:33,112
Only it wouldn't have been rape,
would it?

1201
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:35,822
I don't understand.
Why would he rape her?

1202
01:29:38,951 --> 01:29:41,579
Because it makes you feel guilty
you didn't stop it...

1203
01:29:42,996 --> 01:29:44,748
...that you didn't protect her.

1204
01:29:46,625 --> 01:29:50,170
Later on, she may even be as sick
as to tell you she had an abortion.

1205
01:29:50,254 --> 01:29:53,048
- So you don't go to the police.
- I don't want any part of this.

1206
01:29:53,131 --> 01:29:55,259
- There's a man waiting.
- I have to leave...

1207
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:56,509
No!

1208
01:30:02,558 --> 01:30:05,309
Boy, you're getting better, Charles.

1209
01:30:10,481 --> 01:30:13,442
I'm kind of proud of you.

1210
01:30:13,484 --> 01:30:17,114
I want... my fucking money back!

1211
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:19,824
I want everything you took from me.

1212
01:30:24,161 --> 01:30:26,163
Well...

1213
01:30:26,205 --> 01:30:28,624
I don't think that's
gonna be possible, Charlie.

1214
01:30:28,666 --> 01:30:32,335
Just give him his money, and let's go.

1215
01:30:32,419 --> 01:30:35,256
He's a fuckir mark, for chrissake.

1216
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:39,134
That sweetie pie is worried
about that little girl of yours.

1217
01:30:39,175 --> 01:30:42,137
- Oh, stop it!
- She didn't look that sick to me.

1218
01:30:42,178 --> 01:30:43,598
Just stop it!

1219
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:54,149
Let me outta here!
I'm gonna get outta here now!

1220
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:56,943
I'm telling you,
move away from the fucking door!

1221
01:30:57,027 --> 01:31:00,405
I'm gonna shoot!
Get outta my way! I'm leaving

1222
01:31:01,114 --> 01:31:02,365
Ah!

1223
01:31:06,578 --> 01:31:08,037
Frenchie!

1224
01:31:22,468 --> 01:31:23,636
Ah!

1225
01:31:27,891 --> 01:31:30,017
I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker!

1226
01:32:29,826 --> 01:32:31,828
Step by step,
what did you hear?

1227
01:32:31,911 --> 01:32:35,706
Sir, there's no ID on the white male.
Prints people are on it.

1228
01:32:35,789 --> 01:32:39,127
All right. See if he's on the register.
Check what's in the hotel safe.

1229
01:32:39,210 --> 01:32:40,544
Yes, sir.

1230
01:32:40,627 --> 01:32:42,421
Sorry about that. You were saying?

1231
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:44,965
I heard the shots,

1232
01:32:45,007 --> 01:32:47,302
I saw the security guy run past,

1233
01:32:47,385 --> 01:32:49,636
so I just... closed the door.

1234
01:32:49,678 --> 01:32:51,054
You did the right thing.

1235
01:32:51,138 --> 01:32:55,058
You don't know how may wannabe heroes
I ship off to the morgue each week.

1236
01:32:55,142 --> 01:32:58,061
- OK, Mr... Sheen? Schine?
- Schine.

1237
01:32:58,145 --> 01:32:59,229
Schine.

1238
01:32:59,313 --> 01:33:02,982
All right, if we need anything more,
we'll contact you.

1239
01:33:06,987 --> 01:33:09,155
Hey.
You seen Jones from Homicide?

1240
01:33:09,238 --> 01:33:10,990
Yes, sir. Yes, the, uh...

1241
01:33:12,659 --> 01:33:15,454
Vince, can we get the
happy snappers out of here today?

1242
01:33:15,495 --> 01:33:17,914
I'm losir the will to live.

1243
01:33:19,582 --> 01:33:23,502
Frank. What are you doing here, Frank?

1244
01:33:23,544 --> 01:33:25,171
- Where is it?
- I'll show you.

1245
01:33:25,254 --> 01:33:28,424
Heard you found a Smith & Wesson 5906.

1246
01:33:28,507 --> 01:33:31,469
- Yeah, Ballistics has it.
- What a mess.

1247
01:33:32,511 --> 01:33:34,347
Yeah, pretty straightforward.

1248
01:33:34,388 --> 01:33:36,265
A woman and the suit
are having a thing.

1249
01:33:36,349 --> 01:33:37,433
They get mugged,

1250
01:33:37,515 --> 01:33:40,811
security tries to help them...
everybody gets shot.

1251
01:33:40,853 --> 01:33:42,688
I'm interested in that gun,

1252
01:33:42,772 --> 01:33:45,523
so please call me
when you get the ballistics report.

1253
01:33:45,565 --> 01:33:47,108
Sure.

1254
01:33:47,192 --> 01:33:49,946
- Thanks.
- OK, take care.

1255
01:33:53,031 --> 01:33:56,243
Vince,
can we get everybody out of here?

1256
01:33:56,326 --> 01:33:58,871
- I need a statement.
- Gonna take long?

1257
01:33:58,954 --> 01:34:01,373
- Couple minutes.
- I don't got much time.

1258
01:34:01,456 --> 01:34:02,749
Keep it coming.

1259
01:34:02,832 --> 01:34:04,709
I was standing here.

1260
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:08,797
You got a lot in that safe.

1261
01:34:15,387 --> 01:34:17,389
I, uh...

1262
01:34:17,472 --> 01:34:20,016
I believe that's mine.

1263
01:34:28,482 --> 01:34:29,775
Nice briefcase.

1264
01:34:29,859 --> 01:34:33,154
OK, what else you got?

1265
01:34:43,247 --> 01:34:45,457
Back it up there, back it up.

1266
01:35:08,188 --> 01:35:10,607
No sign of it here, either.

1267
01:35:10,690 --> 01:35:12,692
All right, thanks.

1268
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:23,161
What the hell is this?

1269
01:35:24,370 --> 01:35:26,706
All the years I've known you,

1270
01:35:27,665 --> 01:35:29,959
I never figured you
for a thief, Charles.

1271
01:35:31,211 --> 01:35:35,215
You want to tell me
about the $10,000 for the aspirin spot?

1272
01:35:35,298 --> 01:35:38,635
It was an emergency.
I was gonna pay it back.

1273
01:35:38,676 --> 01:35:40,427
Pay it back?

1274
01:35:40,469 --> 01:35:42,096
What am I, a bank?

1275
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:44,515
And now you're stealing from it.

1276
01:35:44,599 --> 01:35:47,976
If I were to write a bill for what you
owe me, what should I make it for?

1277
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:49,603
It was just the once, I swear.

1278
01:35:49,686 --> 01:35:52,440
Well, Barry'll be the judge of that.

1279
01:35:52,482 --> 01:35:54,358
So...

1280
01:35:54,441 --> 01:35:57,945
...tell me what was so important
that you had to do this.

1281
01:35:58,028 --> 01:35:59,655
Can't.

1282
01:35:59,739 --> 01:36:02,616
I can't tell you.

1283
01:36:02,658 --> 01:36:05,244
I want to, but I can't. I'm sorry.

1284
01:36:05,327 --> 01:36:09,289
Fine. You wanna play it that way,
I'll start proceedings.

1285
01:36:10,332 --> 01:36:11,833
Proceedings?

1286
01:36:11,875 --> 01:36:14,877
He suspends you
while we conduct an investigation.

1287
01:36:16,837 --> 01:36:18,298
Just pay it back.

1288
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:21,301
The most you'll get
is community service.

1289
01:36:24,262 --> 01:36:27,683
Keep stonewalling us, pal,
you go to jail.

1290
01:36:43,613 --> 01:36:45,324
Hi there.

1291
01:36:48,953 --> 01:36:52,205
- Heya, teach.
- Hank, isn't it?

1292
01:36:52,289 --> 01:36:53,666
That's good.

1293
01:36:53,708 --> 01:36:56,210
I hate it when people
don't remember your name.

1294
01:36:56,252 --> 01:36:57,711
Go on through.

1295
01:37:00,380 --> 01:37:04,427
- It's Charles, by the way.
- Right. Charles.

1296
01:37:05,635 --> 01:37:09,139
- Did I ask you what you're in for yet?
- Embezzlement.

1297
01:37:09,222 --> 01:37:10,600
That's not a bad deal.

1298
01:37:10,683 --> 01:37:14,352
Six months teaching cons
for ripping off your boss.

1299
01:37:14,436 --> 01:37:16,354
You're Puerto Rican, right?

1300
01:37:16,396 --> 01:37:18,523
What the fuck is that?

1301
01:37:18,565 --> 01:37:20,150
Puerto Rico, how do you spell it?

1302
01:37:20,233 --> 01:37:22,485
OK, guys.

1303
01:37:24,487 --> 01:37:25,947
Guys!

1304
01:37:27,406 --> 01:37:29,492
There's a quiz on your desks.

1305
01:37:29,576 --> 01:37:33,121
It'll probably take you as long as it
takes me to read your homework, so...

1306
01:37:34,622 --> 01:37:36,207
Let's go.

1307
01:37:51,096 --> 01:37:52,514
How do you spell that?

1308
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:11,867
"The morning it all began,

1309
01:38:11,951 --> 01:38:14,161
began like any other morning.

1310
01:38:14,245 --> 01:38:16,746
Charles was running late,

1311
01:38:16,788 --> 01:38:19,791
and as a result,
he missed his regular train.

1312
01:38:29,885 --> 01:38:31,803
Championship fucking.

1313
01:38:31,844 --> 01:38:33,721
Twelve rounder.

1314
01:38:33,805 --> 01:38:36,266
I need a loan, Charlie.

1315
01:38:38,643 --> 01:38:40,979
Charles had made him kill.

1316
01:38:41,020 --> 01:38:43,523
Charles was to blame.

1317
01:38:43,606 --> 01:38:46,108
He was a murder suspect.

1318
01:38:46,149 --> 01:38:49,153
Lucinda turned out to be
this whole other person.

1319
01:38:49,237 --> 01:38:50,822
Charles wiped his prints

1320
01:38:50,905 --> 01:38:54,283
and ran away like he was never there,

1321
01:38:54,324 --> 01:38:57,328
back to his shitty little life.

1322
01:38:57,412 --> 01:38:59,955
But when he finished reading the story,

1323
01:38:59,997 --> 01:39:02,708
he went to the laundry room."

1324
01:39:27,274 --> 01:39:29,984
- Yeah?
- I need to use the bathroom.

1325
01:39:30,026 --> 01:39:32,404
I'll alert the media.

1326
01:39:54,217 --> 01:39:56,551
You looking for a daddy?

1327
01:40:04,893 --> 01:40:07,021
What the fuck
you looking at, homey?

1328
01:40:07,063 --> 01:40:09,982
Oooh...

1329
01:40:43,974 --> 01:40:46,934
I hope you liked my story.

1330
01:40:49,061 --> 01:40:52,858
You never checked if I made it out
of that hotel alive, did you?

1331
01:40:52,941 --> 01:40:56,402
You're so
predictable, Charles.

1332
01:40:56,485 --> 01:40:58,612
It takes more
than one bullet to kill me.

1333
01:40:58,696 --> 01:41:01,031
Much more.

1334
01:41:06,495 --> 01:41:09,582
But you took something from me, Charlie,

1335
01:41:09,665 --> 01:41:11,625
and that ain't right.

1336
01:41:14,211 --> 01:41:16,129
It's my money.

1337
01:41:17,464 --> 01:41:19,341
Fuck the money.

1338
01:41:19,425 --> 01:41:22,802
- You killed her.
- You're insane.

1339
01:41:26,557 --> 01:41:28,975
I loved her, Charlie...

1340
01:41:29,017 --> 01:41:31,311
...when you just wanted to fuck her.

1341
01:41:32,854 --> 01:41:34,815
What do you want?

1342
01:41:36,733 --> 01:41:38,568
I want you, Charlie.

1343
01:41:45,992 --> 01:41:48,870
I'm gonna fuck
with your life because I can.

1344
01:41:51,955 --> 01:41:53,082
By the way...

1345
01:41:54,709 --> 01:41:57,794
...is your daughter still a virgin?

1346
01:42:01,049 --> 01:42:04,968
You don't know how happy I was
to see your name on those notebooks.

1347
01:42:05,010 --> 01:42:07,513
It's like if you begged me to find you.

1348
01:42:07,554 --> 01:42:10,892
Man, you ended up
in the wrong prison, Charlie.

1349
01:42:10,975 --> 01:42:12,476
- LaRoche.
- Yeah?

1350
01:42:12,518 --> 01:42:14,561
I chose this prison.

1351
01:42:16,939 --> 01:42:18,273
Oh!

1352
01:42:57,728 --> 01:43:00,565
OK, Mr. Schine. You're free to go.

1353
01:43:11,032 --> 01:43:12,577
You take it easy now.

1354
01:43:22,753 --> 01:43:25,088
I met him
a few times a while ago.

1355
01:43:26,756 --> 01:43:28,842
Here he comes.
All right, thank you.

1356
01:43:38,059 --> 01:43:41,271
- What did you tell them?
- The truth.

1357
01:43:41,354 --> 01:43:44,815
I went to use the bathroom,
and this guy jumped me with a shank.

1358
01:43:46,108 --> 01:43:49,863
Well, that guy
was the asshole who killed Winston.

1359
01:43:53,282 --> 01:43:56,244
He killed two people in Paris,

1360
01:43:56,328 --> 01:43:58,496
one in New York.

1361
01:43:58,580 --> 01:44:01,290
You expect me to believe
that you overpowered him?

1362
01:44:01,957 --> 01:44:03,417
I guess I got lucky.

1363
01:44:12,218 --> 01:44:15,221
You brought that shank in with you,
it's premeditated murder.

1364
01:44:16,972 --> 01:44:18,766
Law don't care who you kill.

1365
01:44:24,188 --> 01:44:26,690
I guess the law didn't care much
for Winston, either.

1366
01:45:26,164 --> 01:45:27,916
Bye. See you guys later.

1367
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,293
OK, sweetheart.
