1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,759
Dirty Wars (2013) - Bluray
Full Subs.

2
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,650
Kabul, Afghanistan,

3
00:00:22,695 --> 00:00:24,094
4:00 in the morning.

4
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:27,889
As an American journalist,

5
00:00:27,934 --> 00:00:30,061
I was used to filing stories
in the middle of the night.

6
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:33,462
But there's always
something eerie

7
00:00:33,506 --> 00:00:35,498
driving through the
deserted streets.

8
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,939
A city of 3 million-

9
00:00:38,978 --> 00:00:40,605
barely a streetlight on.

10
00:00:45,384 --> 00:00:47,216
It was a familiar routine:

11
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:49,051
Waiting for the crew to
light up the night sky

12
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:51,215
so you could see something
in the background.

13
00:00:53,025 --> 00:00:55,425
But could we really see?

14
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:57,656
Well, Keith, greetings
from Kabul, Afghanistan,

15
00:00:57,697 --> 00:00:59,790
where the U.S. Ambassador
Karl Eikenberry...

16
00:00:59,832 --> 00:01:02,494
This is a story about the seen

17
00:01:02,535 --> 00:01:04,127
and the unseen...

18
00:01:07,874 --> 00:01:10,001
And about things
hidden in plain sight.

19
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,821
It's hard to say when
this story began.

20
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:25,721
I'd been working
as a war reporter

21
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:27,350
for more than a decade

22
00:01:27,393 --> 00:01:30,829
in Yugoslavia, Iraq,
and now Afghanistan.

23
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:34,798
After nearly ten years,

24
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:37,326
the war here wasn't
exactly breaking news.

25
00:01:38,605 --> 00:01:39,629
I think there's, like-

26
00:01:39,673 --> 00:01:41,105
there's, like, eight rakes.

27
00:01:43,309 --> 00:01:44,640
One, two, three...

28
00:01:46,112 --> 00:01:47,238
We haven't been out here.

29
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,508
What's the name of
this village out here?

30
00:01:48,548 --> 00:01:49,515
Oh, I have no idea.

31
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:50,538
They all blend in for me.

32
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:51,709
Yeah.

33
00:01:58,858 --> 00:02:00,758
What's the focus of
your campaign here?

34
00:02:00,793 --> 00:02:02,090
In southern Nangarhar,

35
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:04,562
we're dealing with the Ashkar-

36
00:02:04,597 --> 00:02:06,064
Ashkael-

37
00:02:06,098 --> 00:02:08,828
uh, Asherkeil tribe.

38
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:11,234
You know, the wording,
uh, I'll get right

39
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,534
probably when we leave
next year, but...

40
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:15,097
This was supposed to
be the front line

41
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:16,267
in the war on terror.

42
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:21,309
From Kabul out on an
exercise with the military

43
00:02:21,347 --> 00:02:22,905
and back to Kabul,

44
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:26,545
the Afghan Press Corps
was locked in a bubble.

45
00:02:26,587 --> 00:02:28,555
We were told that the
battle for hearts and minds

46
00:02:28,589 --> 00:02:29,555
was being won

47
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:30,681
as soldiers dug wells

48
00:02:30,723 --> 00:02:32,588
or drank tea with tribal elders.

49
00:02:35,261 --> 00:02:37,559
But I knew I was
missing the story.

50
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,428
There was another war,

51
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:43,196
hinted at in press conferences

52
00:02:43,236 --> 00:02:45,466
and detailed in each
morning's press release.

53
00:02:47,273 --> 00:02:49,867
December 14th, Zabul Province,

54
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:51,433
a night raid.

55
00:02:51,477 --> 00:02:53,172
Four Taliban killed,

56
00:02:53,212 --> 00:02:55,077
three detained for questioning.

57
00:02:55,114 --> 00:02:56,809
No civilians injured.

58
00:02:58,885 --> 00:03:00,682
No one at NATO would
give us anything more

59
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,915
than the lists of
nighttime raids.

60
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:05,389
No one even seemed to know
who was doing the raids.

61
00:03:06,993 --> 00:03:09,223
And I wasn't going to find
out if I stayed in Kabul.

62
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:36,801
POLICE HEADQUARTERS
JALALABAD, AFGHANISTAN

63
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:43,141
This is the third raid in my district.

64
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:47,812
13 or 14 people
have been killed in all.

65
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,356
They were innocent people.

66
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:52,092
So what you're saying

67
00:03:52,138 --> 00:03:53,605
is that the Americans
will come into a district

68
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,765
where you're the
police commander,

69
00:03:54,807 --> 00:03:56,741
and they won't inform you
that they're gonna carry out

70
00:03:56,776 --> 00:03:58,252
this kind of action
in your district.

71
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:06,206
I've asked the American
soldiers that come to my district.

72
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:08,457
But even the main
NATO base here says

73
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:11,168
they don't know
anything about the raids.

74
00:04:11,198 --> 00:04:14,214
The troops came
from another base.

75
00:04:22,902 --> 00:04:24,369
So there's the two-

76
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:26,735
the two men in the guesthouse
were the first people killed.

77
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:31,971
And then...

78
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,268
The farmer from here.

79
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:36,973
- Yeah.
- And then another farmer.

80
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:38,040
Two.
Two of his sons.

81
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:39,346
Two.

82
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:40,409
- Mm-hmm.
- Two of his sons.

83
00:04:40,453 --> 00:04:41,647
So there's, I think-
so seven.

84
00:04:41,687 --> 00:04:42,745
Or two-

85
00:04:42,788 --> 00:04:44,221
- Two, two---four.
One farmer---five.

86
00:04:44,256 --> 00:04:45,245
Two these---
seven.

87
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:48,055
Two...

88
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:56,463
The Americans will say anything.

89
00:04:56,493 --> 00:05:01,135
The Americans will say anything,
everyone knows that.

90
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:03,429
If the Americans do this again,

91
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:06,557
we are ready to shed
our blood fighting them.

92
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:12,438
We would rather die than
sit by and do nothing.

93
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:27,396
The list of raids from
NATO press releases

94
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:29,367
read like a map of a hidden war.

95
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,769
The military divided the roads
in Afghanistan by color.

96
00:05:36,575 --> 00:05:37,872
Green was safe.

97
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,104
Red was dangerous.

98
00:05:39,145 --> 00:05:40,169
And black?

99
00:05:40,212 --> 00:05:41,339
Don't even try it.

100
00:05:43,116 --> 00:05:44,378
Most of the raids were happening

101
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:46,009
far beyond the green zone

102
00:05:46,052 --> 00:05:48,850
in what the military
called "denied areas"...

103
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:51,848
Places where journalists
never show up

104
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:52,949
to ask questions.

105
00:05:56,395 --> 00:05:57,919
NATO, the U.S. Embassy,

106
00:05:57,963 --> 00:05:59,123
and my own better judgment

107
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:02,032
all advised against
traveling there.

108
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:04,161
But I'd read about
a raid in Gardez,

109
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:06,397
half a day's drive
in Paktia Province.

110
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:11,808
I pushed as far as I
could into the gray area

111
00:06:11,844 --> 00:06:14,278
on the fraying edge
of NATO's control,

112
00:06:14,313 --> 00:06:15,780
past rusting Russian tanks

113
00:06:15,815 --> 00:06:17,976
and bombed-out NATO
supply convoys.

114
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:22,710
Two other journalists had
been kidnapped on this road,

115
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:23,983
and after weeks

116
00:06:24,023 --> 00:06:25,854
in the military's
armored vehicles,

117
00:06:25,891 --> 00:06:28,724
our Toyota felt
thin-skinned and fragile.

118
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:33,525
I knew I had to be back
in Kabul before sunset,

119
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,727
when the Taliban took
control of the roads.

120
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:37,963
But I had no idea how far

121
00:06:38,003 --> 00:06:39,971
my visit to Gardez
would lead me.

122
00:06:40,193 --> 00:06:43,237
GARDEZ
PAKTIA PROVINCE

123
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:47,074
This is my son,
and this is my son,

124
00:06:47,104 --> 00:06:49,076
and this is my
daughter-in-law,

125
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:51,204
and this is my granddaughter.

126
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:56,834
They killed them
all on a single day.

127
00:06:57,293 --> 00:07:02,382
Two of the women they
killed were pregnant.

128
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:06,552
One was 5 months, the
other was 4 months pregnant.

129
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:09,806
A child had been
born in our home

130
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:13,059
and we had organized
a party to celebrate.

131
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:18,731
We invited many
guests and had music.

132
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:24,152
During the party,
people were dancing

133
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:28,699
our traditional dance, the attan.

134
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:46,509
The American forces came
between 3:30 and 4:00 am.

135
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:49,719
Daoud went to see
what was happening.

136
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:51,806
He thought the
Taliban had come.

137
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,644
They were already
on the roof.

138
00:08:00,273 --> 00:08:03,525
They shot Daoud as
soon as he stepped outside.

139
00:08:03,555 --> 00:08:05,736
All the children were shouting,

140
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,865
"Daoud is shot!
Daoud is shot!"

141
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:11,283
We brought Daoud in here.

142
00:08:11,313 --> 00:08:12,576
The women grabbed Zaher.

143
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:15,746
They told him not to
go or he would be killed.

144
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,748
But they opened fire.

145
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:21,752
They killed three women,
along with Zaher.

146
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,061
My wife, my sister,
and my niece.

147
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:31,053
Look at these
patched bullet holes.

148
00:08:39,024 --> 00:08:40,889
Was Mr. Daoud
killed immediately,

149
00:08:40,926 --> 00:08:43,010
or did he live for a
while after he was shot?

150
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,154
Daoud and my sister-in-law
were alive until 7:00 am.

151
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:53,034
They didn't let us take
them to the hospital.

152
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:58,706
The Americans used knives to dig
the bullets out of their bodies.

153
00:08:58,945 --> 00:09:01,913
They pulled out the
bullets from their body.

154
00:09:01,947 --> 00:09:04,074
You saw the U.S. Forces

155
00:09:04,116 --> 00:09:05,913
take the bullets
out of the body?

156
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,216
Ja.

157
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:15,515
They tied our
hands and blindfolded us.

158
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,226
Two people grabbed us.

159
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:21,479
They pushed us one
by one into the aircraft.

160
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:25,483
They flew us
to another province.

161
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,236
To Paktika.

162
00:09:31,143 --> 00:09:33,907
So he had just seen his wife
killed by the American forces,

163
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:37,245
and then he himself was taken
prisoner by the Americans.

164
00:09:37,283 --> 00:09:39,274
What was going through his
head when they took him?

165
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:42,457
My senses weren't
working at all. I couldn't cry.

166
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:45,002
I was numb and
didn't feel a thing.

167
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:49,215
I didn't eat for
three days and nights.

168
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:52,802
My hands and clothes
were caked with blood.

169
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:57,139
They didn't give us water
to wash the blood away.

170
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:01,268
The interrogators had beards
and didn't wear American uniforms.

171
00:10:01,298 --> 00:10:07,411
They had big muscles.
Sometimes they acted nice.

172
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,526
And sometimes
they would shake us.

173
00:10:09,556 --> 00:10:11,069
By the time I got home,

174
00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:15,032
all our dead had
already been buried.

175
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:19,131
Only my father and my brother were left
at home. I didn't want to live anymore.

176
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,509
I wanted to wear a suicide jacket

177
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:25,001
and blow myself up
among the Americans.

178
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,223
But my brother and my
father wouldn't let me.

179
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:29,922
I wanted Jihad
against the Americans.

180
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:38,347
MOHAMMED DAOUD
1:00 AM - FEBRUARY 12, 2010

181
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,941
MOHAMMED DAOUD
2:00 PM - FEBRUARY 12, 2010

182
00:11:26,993 --> 00:11:28,289
The family had no idea

183
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:30,022
what led the Americans
to their home.

184
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,152
MOHAMMED DAOUD
POLICE COMMANDER, GARDEZ

185
00:11:33,598 --> 00:11:35,828
They had long fought
against the Taliban,

186
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:37,630
and Daoud was a police commander

187
00:11:37,668 --> 00:11:40,297
who'd been through dozens
of U.S. training programs.

188
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:42,506
This is my son,
the Police Commander.

189
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,121
Was he Taliban?

190
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:53,005
They said they had information
that 50 Taliban were here.

191
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:58,010
But they were all my relatives,
and they worked for the government.

192
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:01,639
They killed my innocent sons,
daughter, and daughter-in-law.

193
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:08,604
They had committed no
sin and had no enemies.

194
00:12:12,704 --> 00:12:14,297
As we prepared to leave,

195
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,570
Daoud's granddaughter
spoke to us,

196
00:12:16,609 --> 00:12:19,702
but only later would I know
the meaning of her words.

197
00:12:31,323 --> 00:12:33,553
Daoud's family told
me it was time to go.

198
00:12:33,592 --> 00:12:35,924
The sun sets early
in the mountains,

199
00:12:35,961 --> 00:12:37,656
and the night belongs
to the Taliban.

200
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:17,832
The gunfire continued,

201
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,861
and it was now obvious
how dangerous,

202
00:13:19,905 --> 00:13:21,964
maybe even reckless
the trip had been.

203
00:13:25,277 --> 00:13:26,710
Mm-hmm.

204
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:32,373
NATO wasted no time
issuing a report.

205
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:33,941
They claimed that the
women killed in Gardez

206
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:36,420
were the victims of a
Taliban honor killing,

207
00:13:36,455 --> 00:13:37,581
bound and gagged

208
00:13:37,623 --> 00:13:40,183
by their own murderous families.

209
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:42,193
You saw the U.S. Forces

210
00:13:42,227 --> 00:13:43,990
take the bullets
out of the body?

211
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:51,128
I believed the family,

212
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:53,400
but that wasn't enough

213
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:55,564
for me or anyone else.

214
00:13:55,606 --> 00:13:57,506
[Speaking indistinctly]

215
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:59,703
Who were these men that
stormed into Daoud's home?

216
00:14:01,146 --> 00:14:03,011
And why would they go to
such horrifying lengths

217
00:14:03,048 --> 00:14:04,481
to cover up their actions?

218
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:08,224
Tamana.
Who did the Americans kill?

219
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:13,604
They killed my grandfather...

220
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,815
...and Gulalai.

221
00:14:16,065 --> 00:14:19,235
And they killed Agha Abdulnoor.

222
00:14:27,906 --> 00:14:29,032
All right.

223
00:14:29,074 --> 00:14:30,564
Ready? Yeah.

224
00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:32,941
One, two, three.

225
00:14:42,621 --> 00:14:43,781
Good morning.

226
00:14:43,822 --> 00:14:45,948
The subcommittee
will come to order.

227
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,119
The subject is
national security.

228
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:52,226
HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
WASHINGTON, DC

229
00:14:53,332 --> 00:14:54,993
If my esteemed friend,

230
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:56,398
the gentleman from Michigan,

231
00:14:56,435 --> 00:14:58,232
wishes to continue
with this hearing,

232
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,532
I think that's fine.

233
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:01,766
He is the chairman.

234
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:02,933
But next year,

235
00:15:02,975 --> 00:15:05,603
when this committee is
under new management,

236
00:15:05,644 --> 00:15:07,475
we won't be looking
at the calendar

237
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:09,571
of last year or two years ago.

238
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:10,707
Thank you.

239
00:15:12,851 --> 00:15:15,445
Far from discussing
the distant past,

240
00:15:15,487 --> 00:15:17,148
I'd like to share
with this committee

241
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:19,885
part of my investigation into
deadly U.S. night raids...

242
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:22,223
Sensenbrenner walked out,

243
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,921
but no one else even
bothered to show up...

244
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,888
Just Chairman Conyers
and his staffers.

245
00:15:26,932 --> 00:15:28,899
In closing, Mr. Ohairman,
I told these families

246
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:31,425
that I'd bring their cases
before the U.S. Congress

247
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,993
and ask that they
be investigated

248
00:15:33,037 --> 00:15:35,506
and that those responsible
be held accountable.

249
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,700
On behalf of those families...

250
00:15:36,742 --> 00:15:38,073
It didn't surprise me

251
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,738
that Washington wasn't
interested in Gardez.

252
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:42,644
As an investigative reporter,

253
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:44,444
you rarely have
people's attention.

254
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:48,381
More often than not,
you work alone,

255
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,253
and the stories you labor
over fall on deaf ears.

256
00:15:52,658 --> 00:15:54,956
But sometimes a story
strikes a nerve,

257
00:15:54,993 --> 00:15:57,723
and you're thrown into
the public arena.

258
00:15:57,763 --> 00:15:59,560
It happened to me once before.

259
00:15:59,598 --> 00:16:00,656
During its time in Iraq,

260
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:02,690
Blackwater has regularly
engaged in firefights

261
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:03,996
and other deadly incidents...

262
00:16:04,036 --> 00:16:05,594
It was 2007,

263
00:16:05,637 --> 00:16:07,264
and I was reporting
on Blackwater,

264
00:16:07,305 --> 00:16:09,535
a shadowy mercenary company,

265
00:16:09,574 --> 00:16:11,701
and suddenly it was
front-page news.

266
00:16:11,743 --> 00:16:13,711
A frequent contributor
to The Nation magazine,

267
00:16:13,745 --> 00:16:15,177
his new book is
called Blackwater.

268
00:16:15,212 --> 00:16:16,975
Jeremy Scahill, who authored
the book Blackwater...

269
00:16:17,014 --> 00:16:18,072
Who's come to us from London...

270
00:16:18,115 --> 00:16:19,480
Joining me now is
Jeremy Scahill.

271
00:16:19,517 --> 00:16:20,576
I quickly discovered

272
00:16:20,619 --> 00:16:22,712
that the world of
talk show television

273
00:16:22,754 --> 00:16:24,244
is less a meeting
place for ideas

274
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:25,756
and more like a boxing ring.

275
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:26,917
That is hooey.

276
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,152
$700 million

277
00:16:28,193 --> 00:16:30,024
for a colonial
fortress in Pakistan.

278
00:16:30,062 --> 00:16:32,394
The whole thing
feels like a game.

279
00:16:32,431 --> 00:16:34,365
But every time you
step into the ring,

280
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,731
there's a chance your
story can have an impact.

281
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:38,326
Journalists have done nothing

282
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,065
to hold the White House
accountable now,

283
00:16:40,105 --> 00:16:41,663
Chuck, or under Bush.

284
00:16:41,707 --> 00:16:42,799
Let me get to the story-

285
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:43,899
- Why are you still alive?

286
00:16:43,942 --> 00:16:44,966
Are you paranoid?

287
00:16:46,211 --> 00:16:47,508
No, I'm serious. I'm serious.

288
00:16:47,546 --> 00:16:49,480
I mean, it's an amazing
book that you've written,

289
00:16:49,514 --> 00:16:51,311
and I'm curious that-
"Oh, that guy had a"-

290
00:16:51,349 --> 00:16:52,543
"Remember that guy
we did Maher with?"

291
00:16:52,584 --> 00:16:53,608
"Oh, he's dead."
"What happened?"

292
00:16:53,652 --> 00:16:54,846
"He had an
accident." I mean...

293
00:16:54,886 --> 00:16:56,012
And here are the-

294
00:16:58,056 --> 00:17:01,025
Residents are being
picked up, abducted...

295
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:02,616
Congress wasn't going
to investigate

296
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,389
the raid in Gardez.

297
00:17:04,428 --> 00:17:05,952
And my Freedom of
Information requests

298
00:17:05,996 --> 00:17:07,588
were bounced all
over the military,

299
00:17:07,631 --> 00:17:10,761
ending up in an unnamed
agency awaiting review.

300
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:15,072
I reached out to everyone
I could in Washington-

301
00:17:15,107 --> 00:17:17,871
the CIA, State Department,

302
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:19,809
former military officials-

303
00:17:19,845 --> 00:17:22,405
but no one would speak
openly about Gardez...

304
00:17:23,682 --> 00:17:25,445
Until I met with
General Hugh Shelton,

305
00:17:25,484 --> 00:17:28,419
Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs on 9/11.

306
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:31,427
GEN. HUGH SHELTON
CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF

307
00:17:32,124 --> 00:17:34,092
One incident that I looked
into in Afghanistan,

308
00:17:34,126 --> 00:17:35,559
where an Afghan police commander

309
00:17:35,594 --> 00:17:37,221
and two pregnant
women were killed-

310
00:17:37,262 --> 00:17:38,752
but the question I
wanted to ask you is,

311
00:17:38,797 --> 00:17:40,560
in that kind of case-
let's say that's true-

312
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:42,157
how would something
like that be handled

313
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,963
or investigated or reviewed?

314
00:17:44,002 --> 00:17:45,765
If they go flying in

315
00:17:45,804 --> 00:17:47,669
and meet any kind of
resistance at all-

316
00:17:47,706 --> 00:17:49,434
I mean, shots are fired-

317
00:17:49,473 --> 00:17:51,441
then I'm sorry if
they got killed,

318
00:17:51,475 --> 00:17:53,466
but they're in the wrong
place at the wrong time,

319
00:17:53,511 --> 00:17:55,308
and I don't think it ought
to be investigated.

320
00:17:55,346 --> 00:17:56,472
I think you write it off

321
00:17:56,514 --> 00:17:59,508
as one of those
damn acts of war.

322
00:17:59,552 --> 00:18:01,781
But one of the victims was
a senior police commander

323
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,412
who had been trained
by the U.S.

324
00:18:03,455 --> 00:18:04,888
And two of them were
pregnant women.

325
00:18:04,923 --> 00:18:06,550
Now, just 'cause
he's a police chief-

326
00:18:06,591 --> 00:18:08,525
he could've been a
terrorist as well.

327
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,425
You know, he could've
been working both sides,

328
00:18:10,462 --> 00:18:13,488
so that piece of it,
although it sounds bad-

329
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:15,830
but two pregnant women?

330
00:18:15,867 --> 00:18:19,598
The fact that they were pregnant
is very, very unfortunate,

331
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:21,765
but it's also unfortunate
that they were women.

332
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:23,604
But on the other hand,

333
00:18:23,642 --> 00:18:26,873
I've been shot at
by women myself,

334
00:18:26,912 --> 00:18:28,209
so that doesn't-

335
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:29,611
And I mean shot at.

336
00:18:29,648 --> 00:18:31,946
That doesn't excuse 'em.

337
00:18:31,983 --> 00:18:35,146
They die just like men do
if they shoot at us, so...

338
00:18:41,892 --> 00:18:43,883
Congress wasn't interested.

339
00:18:43,928 --> 00:18:45,897
I was being stonewalled
by the military.

340
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:47,057
And General Shelton told me

341
00:18:47,098 --> 00:18:49,089
there should be
no investigation.

342
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,140
KAIA AIRPORT
KABUL, AFGHANISTAN

343
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,797
And back in Afghanistan,

344
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:55,932
the reporter who first
broke the Gardez story

345
00:18:55,974 --> 00:18:57,942
had been publicly
attacked by NATO.

346
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:01,483
JEROME STARKEY
TIMES OF LONDON

347
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:03,504
Yeah, we went to
print on a Saturday.

348
00:19:06,885 --> 00:19:08,352
By Saturday afternoon,

349
00:19:08,386 --> 00:19:09,648
I was getting information

350
00:19:09,688 --> 00:19:11,679
from other journalists in
Kabul who are my friends

351
00:19:11,723 --> 00:19:13,350
that NATO was
briefing against me.

352
00:19:13,391 --> 00:19:15,018
NATO was trying to discredit me,

353
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,857
trying to say that the
story was inaccurate,

354
00:19:16,895 --> 00:19:18,829
and effectively trying
to kill it dead.

355
00:19:19,965 --> 00:19:22,058
To my knowledge, that
was the only time

356
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,589
that they've named a journalist

357
00:19:23,634 --> 00:19:27,126
and sort of singled out a
journalist so specifically

358
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:28,638
in a denial.

359
00:19:28,672 --> 00:19:31,072
NATO accused Starkey of lying.

360
00:19:31,108 --> 00:19:33,873
It could have been enough to
end a journalist's career.

361
00:19:33,912 --> 00:19:37,508
But information about
Gardez kept leaking out.

362
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,517
A secret UN
investigation confirmed

363
00:19:39,551 --> 00:19:42,019
many of the details the
family had told us,

364
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:44,419
and an Afghan police
inquiry was under way.

365
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,146
MOHAMMED DAOUD

366
00:19:54,232 --> 00:19:56,860
I didn't realize what the
family was showing me.

367
00:19:56,902 --> 00:19:58,426
It was just a grainy
cell phone video

368
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,903
from the morning
after the attack...

369
00:19:59,938 --> 00:20:01,098
[indistinct conversation]

370
00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:02,504
Until the voices began.

371
00:20:23,662 --> 00:20:24,686
When I get to here...

372
00:20:24,729 --> 00:20:25,890
Two Americans,

373
00:20:25,932 --> 00:20:27,489
their hands visible for a moment

374
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:28,897
filming the corpses

375
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:30,492
while they piece
together their version

376
00:20:30,535 --> 00:20:31,695
of that night's killings.

377
00:20:36,441 --> 00:20:38,204
NATO phoned me up,
and they said,

378
00:20:38,243 --> 00:20:40,006
"Jerome, we're just
calling to let you know

379
00:20:40,045 --> 00:20:41,910
"we're about to put
out a press release.

380
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:44,279
We are changing our
version of events."

381
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:47,285
They admitted that
they were responsible

382
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:50,720
for killing the three women

383
00:20:50,755 --> 00:20:53,383
and that the men they
said were Taliban

384
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:55,256
were not, in fact, Taliban.

385
00:20:55,293 --> 00:20:56,384
They admitted they'd
got it wrong.

386
00:20:56,427 --> 00:20:58,156
Again, they were hoping
it was gonna go away.

387
00:20:58,195 --> 00:20:59,321
Well, it wasn't.

388
00:20:59,363 --> 00:21:01,558
Like yourselves, we set off
very early one morning

389
00:21:01,598 --> 00:21:03,759
from Kabul through
Logar to Gardez...

390
00:21:04,902 --> 00:21:07,531
When up rolls a huge convoy

391
00:21:07,572 --> 00:21:10,973
of countless Afghan
officers and soldiers.

392
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:12,135
And among them is a man

393
00:21:12,177 --> 00:21:13,804
wearing a uniform
that I recognize

394
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:15,005
as sort of U.S. Marines,

395
00:21:15,046 --> 00:21:16,809
but it says U.S.
Navy on his lapel.

396
00:21:16,848 --> 00:21:18,042
But I didn't know who he was.

397
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,313
They off-loaded a sheep,

398
00:21:20,352 --> 00:21:22,479
and three Afghan soldiers
knelt on this sheep

399
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,919
in exactly the same place

400
00:21:23,955 --> 00:21:26,947
where these soldiers had been
when they started the raid.

401
00:21:26,992 --> 00:21:29,017
They were offering to
sacrifice the sheep.

402
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,585
The soldiers tried to stop
Starkey's photographer,

403
00:21:31,629 --> 00:21:32,926
Jeremy Kelly,

404
00:21:32,964 --> 00:21:35,592
but the family insisted.

405
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:37,066
Otherwise, there'd
be no evidence

406
00:21:37,102 --> 00:21:39,696
that this extraordinary
event occurred,

407
00:21:39,738 --> 00:21:42,206
no proof of who
the killers were.

408
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,173
Like so much about this war,

409
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,176
they would have remained unseen.

410
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,008
He said that, "My
soldiers were responsible

411
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:52,072
for the deaths of these
members of your family,"

412
00:21:52,116 --> 00:21:53,447
and for that, he apologized.

413
00:21:54,273 --> 00:22:02,042
I would not trade my sons for the
entire kingdom of the United States.

414
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:06,213
America unleashes
the Special Forces on us.

415
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:09,216
And the Special Forces
beat and kill poor, innocent people.

416
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:15,711
These Special Forces with the
beards did cruel, criminal things.

417
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:17,838
They all have beards.

418
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,508
We call them
the American Taliban.

419
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:01,006
BROOKLYN, NY

420
00:23:03,955 --> 00:23:05,252
I returned home

421
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:08,282
and tried to put the story
of Gardez behind me.

422
00:23:08,326 --> 00:23:09,918
But coming home is never easy.

423
00:23:14,732 --> 00:23:15,926
I didn't want to admit it,

424
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:17,524
but life back home was dull

425
00:23:17,568 --> 00:23:18,933
after being in a war zone.

426
00:23:21,138 --> 00:23:22,799
Ordinary life was just that.

427
00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:33,012
I tried to forget about Gardez

428
00:23:33,051 --> 00:23:34,109
but couldn't.

429
00:23:34,152 --> 00:23:36,313
We pulled everyone out, okay?

430
00:23:37,255 --> 00:23:38,722
Now, at that point,

431
00:23:38,756 --> 00:23:40,485
I'm watching what's
going on here.

432
00:23:40,525 --> 00:23:41,958
I see it all go down. Now...

433
00:23:41,993 --> 00:23:44,461
The video was chilling,

434
00:23:44,496 --> 00:23:46,487
but I couldn't see their faces.

435
00:23:46,531 --> 00:23:49,557
All I had were images
of their hands

436
00:23:49,601 --> 00:23:50,932
and the sound of their voices.

437
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:52,368
Okay, the blood trail.
This is it.

438
00:23:52,403 --> 00:23:53,529
This is the last room.

439
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:54,902
This is where the
engagement was.

440
00:23:54,939 --> 00:23:56,372
He comes in here. There's-

441
00:23:56,407 --> 00:23:58,034
There's a woman crying
in the doorway.

442
00:23:58,076 --> 00:24:01,307
None of these clues
were supposed to exist-

443
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:02,711
the cell phone video,

444
00:24:02,747 --> 00:24:04,737
the photos of the
admiral and his sheep.

445
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,618
The killers were meant to
disappear without a trace.

446
00:24:11,288 --> 00:24:14,189
The family had called
them "American Taliban."

447
00:24:14,224 --> 00:24:15,486
But who were they,

448
00:24:15,526 --> 00:24:17,927
these American
soldiers with beards?

449
00:24:28,173 --> 00:24:29,765
As a reporter, you
learn that every story

450
00:24:29,807 --> 00:24:31,799
has conflicting points of view.

451
00:24:33,011 --> 00:24:34,569
You try to understand
all of them

452
00:24:34,612 --> 00:24:36,273
without letting your
own get in the way.

453
00:24:38,383 --> 00:24:40,578
But there was something
about this story

454
00:24:40,618 --> 00:24:42,108
and the way it was covered up.

455
00:24:44,322 --> 00:24:46,153
The photo of the admiral
had seemed to answer

456
00:24:46,191 --> 00:24:47,681
our questions about the raid.

457
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,826
But the longer I looked at it,

458
00:24:50,861 --> 00:24:53,125
the less sense it made.

459
00:24:53,163 --> 00:24:55,154
I could read the name and rank,

460
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:57,497
but who was this man
delivering the sheep?

461
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,001
Vice Admiral William McRaven

462
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:03,472
wasn't from NATO
Headquarters in Kabul,

463
00:25:03,507 --> 00:25:05,567
and he wasn't from the
Eastern Regional Command

464
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,009
that owned that battle space.

465
00:25:08,413 --> 00:25:11,541
I'd never seen the R01
insignia on his shoulder.

466
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:14,074
And it was hard to find
mention of him in the press,

467
00:25:14,118 --> 00:25:15,608
much less a photograph.

468
00:25:17,021 --> 00:25:20,354
But I found an old DoD
press briefing from 2008

469
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:22,086
that mentioned
McRaven's nomination

470
00:25:22,126 --> 00:25:24,026
to lead an obscure unit
within the military

471
00:25:24,062 --> 00:25:26,189
called JSOC,

472
00:25:26,231 --> 00:25:28,392
the Joint Special
Operations Command.

473
00:25:31,035 --> 00:25:33,299
After more than a decade
as a war reporter,

474
00:25:33,338 --> 00:25:36,205
I thought I knew most of
the players involved,

475
00:25:36,241 --> 00:25:37,867
but I'd never heard of JSOC.

476
00:25:39,576 --> 00:25:41,544
There was little
official record,

477
00:25:41,578 --> 00:25:43,671
but JSOC was formed in 1980

478
00:25:43,714 --> 00:25:46,148
after the failed hostage
rescue mission in Iran.

479
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,242
It was designed

480
00:25:48,285 --> 00:25:50,583
as the most covert
unit in the military

481
00:25:50,621 --> 00:25:53,147
and the only one that reports
directly to the White House.

482
00:25:55,593 --> 00:25:57,584
So why would the
President's elite force

483
00:25:57,629 --> 00:26:00,393
be kicking down the doors
on a family in Gardez?

484
00:26:02,233 --> 00:26:04,667
I knew Gardez wasn't
an isolated incident

485
00:26:04,702 --> 00:26:07,432
and went back to NATO's
daily press releases

486
00:26:07,472 --> 00:26:09,463
with their lists of
killed and captured.

487
00:26:11,442 --> 00:26:14,240
I expected the list to be long,

488
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,179
but I had no idea how long.

489
00:26:17,949 --> 00:26:20,417
Every week, the tempo
of raids increased.

490
00:26:20,451 --> 00:26:21,850
In the last three months,

491
00:26:21,886 --> 00:26:24,649
there had been 1, 700 night
raids in Afghanistan.

492
00:26:25,956 --> 00:26:28,083
It was a staggering figure

493
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,752
and meant that stories
like the one in Gardez

494
00:26:29,793 --> 00:26:32,489
were unfolding nearly
20 times each night.

495
00:26:33,864 --> 00:26:36,492
An endless list of raids

496
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:38,000
but not a single name.

497
00:26:40,672 --> 00:26:43,470
I could see that Gardez was
part of a bigger story-

498
00:26:43,508 --> 00:26:44,873
much bigger.

499
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:46,809
But the very thought of
it was overwhelming.

500
00:26:48,246 --> 00:26:50,544
With 1, 700 raids,

501
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:52,242
who would compile the
list of the dead?

502
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:06,526
The surge of night raids

503
00:27:06,564 --> 00:27:08,896
was clearly changing the
war in Afghanistan.

504
00:27:11,302 --> 00:27:14,634
It didn't take long for
JSOC's actions to ricochet.

505
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:17,139
Matthew Hoh has become
the first U.S. official

506
00:27:17,174 --> 00:27:20,837
to resign in protest
over the Afghan war.

507
00:27:20,877 --> 00:27:22,708
Hoh is a former marine
who spent five months

508
00:27:22,746 --> 00:27:24,941
working for the State
Department in Afghanistan

509
00:27:24,981 --> 00:27:27,382
and is, by all accounts,
well-respected.

510
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:32,927
CPT. MATTHEW HOH
FORMER STATE DEPT. OFFICIAL

511
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:34,015
A lot of times, yeah,

512
00:27:34,058 --> 00:27:35,491
the right guys would
get targeted,

513
00:27:35,526 --> 00:27:37,153
and the right guys
would get killed.

514
00:27:37,195 --> 00:27:38,492
And then plenty of other times,

515
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:39,894
the wrong people
would get killed,

516
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:41,660
sometimes innocent families.

517
00:27:41,699 --> 00:27:44,167
And then that sets
you back so far.

518
00:27:44,202 --> 00:27:46,170
You know, nothing like
going into a village

519
00:27:46,204 --> 00:27:48,171
in the middle of the night,
knocking a door down,

520
00:27:48,205 --> 00:27:50,106
and, like, killing
a woman or a child

521
00:27:50,141 --> 00:27:53,838
to just undo everything that
infantry battalion command

522
00:27:53,878 --> 00:27:56,472
had been trying to do for, like,
the last nine, ten months.

523
00:27:56,514 --> 00:27:57,538
You were in a position

524
00:27:57,582 --> 00:27:59,640
where you were
trying to vet lists

525
00:27:59,683 --> 00:28:01,651
to make sure that
the wrong people

526
00:28:01,685 --> 00:28:03,482
weren't being killed
by these task forces.

527
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,080
Were there 500 people
on this list, 1,000?

528
00:28:06,123 --> 00:28:07,454
No, I can't-
I can't tell you.

529
00:28:07,491 --> 00:28:08,583
- Oh, you can't?
- Yeah.

530
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:10,149
You can't tell me because...

531
00:28:10,193 --> 00:28:11,888
I can't tell you 'cause I
can't tell you that stuff.

532
00:28:11,928 --> 00:28:12,986
- You can't talk about it?
- Yeah.

533
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:14,054
I saw the list. I saw
how big they are.

534
00:28:14,098 --> 00:28:15,258
Yeah, everything else, yeah.

535
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:16,891
I mean, that's-
I can't tell you.

536
00:28:16,934 --> 00:28:18,094
I was just...

537
00:28:26,477 --> 00:28:28,104
The Joint Special
Operations Command

538
00:28:28,146 --> 00:28:30,239
had never numbered more
than a few thousand.

539
00:28:31,582 --> 00:28:33,106
But under William McRaven,

540
00:28:33,151 --> 00:28:35,585
Afghanistan had
become JSOC's war.

541
00:28:36,788 --> 00:28:38,756
How had such a small covert unit

542
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,485
taken over the largest
conventional war

543
00:28:40,525 --> 00:28:41,583
on the planet?

544
00:28:43,961 --> 00:28:46,588
Andrew Exum had experienced
the change firsthand

545
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,927
when he served as part

546
00:28:47,964 --> 00:28:50,398
of McRaven's high value
targeting campaign,

547
00:28:50,434 --> 00:28:52,095
not in Afghanistan

548
00:28:52,135 --> 00:28:53,830
but in Iraq.

549
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,236
He led a company
of rangers in 2003

550
00:28:56,273 --> 00:28:59,037
as part of JSOC's
Iraq task force.

551
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:01,825
CPT. ANDREW EXUM
75TH RANGER REGIMENT

552
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,081
I watched the way
things began to change.

553
00:29:05,116 --> 00:29:07,516
You know, kind of
the iron rule was,

554
00:29:07,552 --> 00:29:09,645
you don't go anywhere unless
you've got, you know,

555
00:29:09,687 --> 00:29:12,121
a company of Army
Rangers in reserve.

556
00:29:12,156 --> 00:29:15,683
In 2003, nobody was in reserve.

557
00:29:15,726 --> 00:29:18,194
I mean, people were hitting
targets every single night

558
00:29:18,229 --> 00:29:20,026
in a very dispersed way

559
00:29:20,064 --> 00:29:21,895
and just-bam, bam, bam.

560
00:29:21,933 --> 00:29:23,958
I mean, you remember
the deck of cards.

561
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:26,264
We kind of had this
poster of all these guys,

562
00:29:26,303 --> 00:29:29,137
and we went out looking
for them every night.

563
00:29:29,173 --> 00:29:30,697
So we would, you know,
kick down a door

564
00:29:30,741 --> 00:29:32,140
and pull somebody
out of their home

565
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:33,267
in the middle of the night,

566
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,777
and the next morning, you know,

567
00:29:34,811 --> 00:29:36,642
people would be rioting
in the streets.

568
00:29:37,881 --> 00:29:39,246
I'm in!

569
00:29:39,282 --> 00:29:40,306
Clear!

570
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,977
Come out!

571
00:29:42,018 --> 00:29:43,883
On your fuckin' face.

572
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,785
On your face.

573
00:29:49,827 --> 00:29:51,988
Yeah, I remember one
night going out.

574
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:53,223
You know, we found out later

575
00:29:53,264 --> 00:29:55,732
that we were on
two-weeks-old intelligence.

576
00:29:55,766 --> 00:29:57,597
Two Iraqis started
shooting at us.

577
00:29:57,635 --> 00:29:58,966
We killed them.

578
00:29:59,003 --> 00:30:00,971
And, you know, we kind
of realized later

579
00:30:01,005 --> 00:30:03,098
that these guys were
just out guarding the-

580
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,903
you know, the
neighborhood generator.

581
00:30:04,942 --> 00:30:06,603
Now, I didn't lose
any sleep over it,

582
00:30:06,644 --> 00:30:07,941
'cause these guys
were shooting at me,

583
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:09,344
but, you know, you start
thinking about it

584
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,848
from a strategic
perspective- that's a loss.

585
00:30:11,883 --> 00:30:13,908
You start out with
a target list,

586
00:30:13,951 --> 00:30:15,577
and maybe you got 50 guys on it;

587
00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:17,281
maybe you got 200 guys on it.

588
00:30:17,321 --> 00:30:21,222
But you can work your way
through those 50 or 200 guys,

589
00:30:21,258 --> 00:30:22,748
and then suddenly,

590
00:30:22,792 --> 00:30:24,089
at the end of that target list,

591
00:30:24,127 --> 00:30:25,458
you've now got a new target list

592
00:30:25,495 --> 00:30:27,861
of, you know, 3,000
people on it.

593
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:29,593
And how did this grow?

594
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:37,200
What Exum told me about
Iraq was a revelation.

595
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:39,300
I thought JSOC's rise
had happened later

596
00:30:39,343 --> 00:30:41,470
in Afghanistan.

597
00:30:41,512 --> 00:30:43,571
I'd worked in Baghdad for years

598
00:30:43,614 --> 00:30:45,548
and had written countless
stories there,

599
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:47,414
many from the front
lines of the war.

600
00:30:48,753 --> 00:30:50,414
It was there that I
first started reporting

601
00:30:50,454 --> 00:30:51,751
for The Nation magazine.

602
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,817
But I'd never heard of JSOC.

603
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:57,054
The budget for the Joint
Special Operations Command,

604
00:30:57,094 --> 00:30:58,618
you can't get it through
a FOIA request.

605
00:30:58,663 --> 00:30:59,925
We've tried that.

606
00:30:59,964 --> 00:31:02,364
I'd missed the most
important story.

607
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,367
In Iraq, the U.S. had
fundamentally changed

608
00:31:04,401 --> 00:31:05,767
the way it fought war.

609
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,101
The real story, JSOC,

610
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:10,936
was hidden in the shadows,

611
00:31:10,974 --> 00:31:12,032
out of sight.

612
00:31:15,745 --> 00:31:17,372
What was hidden in the
shadows right now?

613
00:31:17,414 --> 00:31:18,847
...That I propose

614
00:31:18,882 --> 00:31:21,942
represent a new direction
from the last eight years.

615
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,687
What was I missing today?

616
00:31:24,722 --> 00:31:28,283
We are embracing more
oversight of our actions,

617
00:31:28,326 --> 00:31:31,489
and we're narrowing our use of
the state secrets privilege.

618
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,864
I discovered that,
over the past decade,

619
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:36,924
a series of secret
presidential orders

620
00:31:36,968 --> 00:31:39,459
had given JSOC
unprecedented authority.

621
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:42,606
The battlefield was expanded,

622
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,267
and JSOC could now hit at will

623
00:31:44,308 --> 00:31:46,799
in countries beyond
Iraq and Afghanistan.

624
00:31:54,517 --> 00:31:56,917
I began to research
strikes against al-Qaeda

625
00:31:56,953 --> 00:31:58,784
outside the declared
battlefields.

626
00:32:00,323 --> 00:32:02,314
I looked for patterns
among the lists.

627
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,786
And then I found one.

628
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:08,223
In December 2009,

629
00:32:08,264 --> 00:32:11,029
five strikes with
over 150 casualties

630
00:32:11,068 --> 00:32:13,059
in a country without
a declared war.

631
00:32:16,941 --> 00:32:19,910
[Man singing in native language]

632
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:31,618
ADEN, YEMEN

633
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:35,251
Aden.

634
00:32:35,292 --> 00:32:36,919
Yemen's ancient port city

635
00:32:36,961 --> 00:32:38,952
was nothing like Kabul.

636
00:32:38,996 --> 00:32:42,395
In Afghanistan, life was
defined by the war.

637
00:32:42,431 --> 00:32:44,593
Everything revolved around it.

638
00:32:44,634 --> 00:32:46,602
But in Yemen, there was no war,

639
00:32:46,636 --> 00:32:47,796
at least not officially.

640
00:32:51,274 --> 00:32:53,469
The strikes seemed to have
come out of the blue,

641
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:56,138
and most Yemenis were going
about life as usual.

642
00:33:00,985 --> 00:33:03,783
It was difficult to
know where to start.

643
00:33:03,821 --> 00:33:06,654
The Yemeni government claimed
responsibility for the strikes,

644
00:33:06,691 --> 00:33:09,956
saying they'd killed dozens
of al-Qaeda operatives.

645
00:33:09,994 --> 00:33:12,792
But it was unclear who
the targets really were

646
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,457
or who was even responsible.

647
00:33:17,635 --> 00:33:19,262
I arranged to meet the
most powerful man

648
00:33:19,303 --> 00:33:20,930
in southern Yemen,

649
00:33:20,971 --> 00:33:22,836
Sheikh Saleh Bin Fareed.

650
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:24,780
SHEIKH SALEH BIN FAREED
LEADER, AL-AULAQ TRIBE

651
00:33:24,942 --> 00:33:27,239
When was the first time
that you heard about

652
00:33:27,277 --> 00:33:29,177
someone being al-Qaeda
in that area?

653
00:33:49,033 --> 00:33:52,161
How did you first
hear of the strikes

654
00:33:52,203 --> 00:33:54,671
that had happened
on December 17th?

655
00:34:01,378 --> 00:34:02,504
What was the news saying?

656
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:25,833
AL MAJALAH
ABYAN PROVINCE

657
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:30,922
People saw the smoke
and felt the earth shake.

658
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:35,605
They had never
seen anything like it.

659
00:35:35,635 --> 00:35:41,099
Iran to the area.
I found scattered bodies

660
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:45,615
and injured women and children.

661
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:51,037
46 people were killed,
including 5 pregnant women.

662
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:53,289
If they kill innocent children
and call them al Qaeda,

663
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:55,530
then we are all al Qaeda.

664
00:35:55,696 --> 00:36:00,159
If children are terrorists,
then we are all terrorists.

665
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:22,056
At 6 am they were sleeping
and I was making bread.

666
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:31,023
When the missiles exploded,
I lost consciousness.

667
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:34,819
I didn't know what happened to my
children, my daughter, my husband.

668
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:36,696
They all died.

669
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:42,493
Only I survived, along with this
old man and my daughter.

670
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:46,164
Missiles attacked me.

671
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,500
And my brother Ibrahim.

672
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:51,127
And my mother.

673
00:36:51,878 --> 00:36:53,629
Their hands were cut.

674
00:36:59,924 --> 00:37:02,757
The echoes of Gardez
were everywhere...

675
00:37:02,793 --> 00:37:05,284
So many of the details
repeating themselves.

676
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:10,794
But there was one
important difference.

677
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:13,596
In Gardez, the American soldiers

678
00:37:13,637 --> 00:37:16,037
went to obscene lengths
to cover up the killings.

679
00:37:17,241 --> 00:37:18,367
Here in al-Majalah,

680
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:20,274
despite the official denial,

681
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:23,074
they'd left their fingerprints
strewn across the desert.

682
00:37:25,281 --> 00:37:27,579
Why would they deny
something so obvious

683
00:37:27,617 --> 00:37:29,107
when anyone who
visited the bomb site

684
00:37:29,152 --> 00:37:30,585
would see the truth?

685
00:37:33,923 --> 00:37:35,515
But maybe that was the point.

686
00:37:35,558 --> 00:37:38,424
There was no declared
war in Yemen.

687
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,486
Out here, in the
middle of the desert,

688
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,829
no one was looking.

689
00:37:42,866 --> 00:37:44,959
And the one local reporter
investigating the bombing

690
00:37:45,002 --> 00:37:46,367
had disappeared.

691
00:37:47,558 --> 00:37:52,450
The decision to arrest me was
made the day I exposed the cover-up

692
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,038
of the murder of women
and children in Abyan.

693
00:37:57,068 --> 00:38:01,489
The day I exposed those who sent
cruise missiles to bedouin camps.

694
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:04,091
ABDULELAH HAIDER SHAYE
YEMENI JOURNALIST

695
00:38:04,121 --> 00:38:06,589
Abdulelah Haider Shaye had
traveled to al-Majalah

696
00:38:06,623 --> 00:38:08,590
immediately after the strike,

697
00:38:08,624 --> 00:38:11,923
and his reporting sparked
national outrage.

698
00:38:11,961 --> 00:38:13,929
Soon after, his house was raided

699
00:38:13,963 --> 00:38:17,160
by Yemen's American-trained
counterterrorism forces.

700
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,100
Abdulelah was thrown in prison.

701
00:38:19,135 --> 00:38:21,126
Posters demanding his return

702
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,501
were hung around the capital.

703
00:38:26,534 --> 00:38:28,562
ABDULRAH MAN BARMAN
ABDULELAH'S LAWYER

704
00:38:28,678 --> 00:38:30,806
I met Abdulelah's
lawyer at a teahouse

705
00:38:30,848 --> 00:38:32,615
because his office
was under attack.

706
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:37,274
They fired over 120
shells into my office.

707
00:38:37,304 --> 00:38:40,039
And now we can't reach it

708
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:42,488
because the Republican Guard
are deployed in the area.

709
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:56,514
In court, I noticed that one of
Abdulelah's teeth had been pulled.

710
00:38:56,544 --> 00:38:58,253
And another
had been broken.

711
00:38:58,283 --> 00:39:01,215
And he had
scars on his chest.

712
00:39:01,911 --> 00:39:04,379
My understanding was that
President Ali Abdullah Saleh

713
00:39:04,414 --> 00:39:07,076
was going to pardon
Abdulelah Haider.

714
00:39:07,106 --> 00:39:10,027
The president
agreed to release him.

715
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:14,020
But that same day, the
president got a call from Obama

716
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:19,817
expressing concern
about Abdulelah's release.

717
00:39:21,565 --> 00:39:24,432
I'd heard the story
many times in Yemen-

718
00:39:24,468 --> 00:39:26,095
President Obama
personally intervening

719
00:39:26,136 --> 00:39:28,502
to keep a respected Yemeni
journalist in prison.

720
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,430
It sounded farfetched to me.

721
00:39:32,943 --> 00:39:34,137
But then I found this

722
00:39:34,178 --> 00:39:36,806
on the White House's
own website,

723
00:39:36,847 --> 00:39:38,109
a readout from a phone call

724
00:39:38,148 --> 00:39:41,015
between Obama and the
Yemeni president.

725
00:39:41,051 --> 00:39:43,280
They badly misspelled
Abdulelah's name,

726
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:45,787
but Obama's point was clear.

727
00:39:45,822 --> 00:39:48,086
He wanted him kept in jail.

728
00:39:52,895 --> 00:39:55,022
Al-Majalah was the
first reported strike

729
00:39:55,064 --> 00:39:56,759
inside Yemen in seven years.

730
00:39:59,235 --> 00:40:00,827
It was clearly a U.S.
Cruise missile

731
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,701
that struck the Bedouin camp.

732
00:40:04,073 --> 00:40:06,304
Since there was no
declared war in Yemen,

733
00:40:06,343 --> 00:40:08,868
I knew the strike was
either JSOC or the CIA.

734
00:40:12,082 --> 00:40:13,447
And then I found this photo.

735
00:40:15,953 --> 00:40:17,887
The U.S. would have
never released it,

736
00:40:17,921 --> 00:40:21,379
but Yemen's president posted
it on his personal website-

737
00:40:21,425 --> 00:40:25,054
a presidential meeting with
an important American guest,

738
00:40:25,095 --> 00:40:27,757
the head of the Joint
Special Operations Command,

739
00:40:27,798 --> 00:40:30,288
Admiral William McRaven.

740
00:41:00,898 --> 00:41:02,525
Joining us now is
Jeremy Scahill,

741
00:41:02,566 --> 00:41:05,034
national security correspondent
for The Nation magazine.

742
00:41:05,068 --> 00:41:06,330
His latest article is all about

743
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,735
the U.S. relationship
with Yemen.

744
00:41:07,771 --> 00:41:09,068
Jeremy, thank you
for joining us.

745
00:41:09,106 --> 00:41:10,095
Thank you.

746
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,334
Back in New York,

747
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:13,343
I started writing
stories about JSOC,

748
00:41:13,377 --> 00:41:15,844
their rise to lead
force in Afghanistan,

749
00:41:15,878 --> 00:41:18,005
their covert strikes in Yemen,

750
00:41:18,047 --> 00:41:19,139
and it felt as though

751
00:41:19,182 --> 00:41:20,672
I had crossed an
invisible tripwire.

752
00:41:20,716 --> 00:41:21,978
The reality is that

753
00:41:22,018 --> 00:41:24,578
U.S. counterterrorism
obsession with Yemen

754
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,019
trumped concern
for human rights.

755
00:41:26,055 --> 00:41:27,750
- That's not true.
- And it's-

756
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,690
Well, it is true.
- It's not true.

757
00:41:29,725 --> 00:41:30,885
Yup, back there.

758
00:41:30,927 --> 00:41:32,360
Does the Pentagon
have any comment

759
00:41:32,395 --> 00:41:34,886
on a report in The Nation today?

760
00:41:34,931 --> 00:41:35,955
And my question is-

761
00:41:35,998 --> 00:41:37,022
- Yeah, I guess- I-I-

762
00:41:37,066 --> 00:41:38,192
- The question is-

763
00:41:38,234 --> 00:41:40,567
you keep denying
covert operations.

764
00:41:40,604 --> 00:41:42,366
Isn't this yet more
evidence of one?

765
00:41:42,405 --> 00:41:43,565
Okay.

766
00:41:43,606 --> 00:41:46,235
Despite whatever
conspiratorial theories

767
00:41:46,276 --> 00:41:49,404
that, you know, magazines
or broadcast outlets

768
00:41:49,446 --> 00:41:51,175
may want to cook up,

769
00:41:51,215 --> 00:41:52,842
there's nothing to it.

770
00:41:52,883 --> 00:41:54,214
So, Jeremy, let me ask you,

771
00:41:54,251 --> 00:41:58,017
have we been going into
all of these countries

772
00:41:58,055 --> 00:42:00,888
over the past decade
with drone attacks,

773
00:42:00,924 --> 00:42:04,552
dropping bombs in countries
where we haven't declared war?

774
00:42:04,594 --> 00:42:06,425
The lack of response
from the major media

775
00:42:06,462 --> 00:42:08,293
and the CIA and all
the rest of it

776
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:11,198
suggests they're dismissing
what you've done.

777
00:42:11,234 --> 00:42:12,997
I receive a call, unprompted,

778
00:42:13,035 --> 00:42:15,970
from a Captain James Kirby,

779
00:42:16,005 --> 00:42:17,905
who is the spokesperson
for Admiral Mike Mullen.

780
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,407
Calls me on my cell phone.

781
00:42:19,442 --> 00:42:21,410
Wouldn't tell me how he
got my cell phone number.

782
00:42:21,444 --> 00:42:23,412
Wouldn't tell me who told
him about the story.

783
00:42:23,446 --> 00:42:24,913
This is hours from publication.

784
00:42:24,947 --> 00:42:26,210
And told me that

785
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,581
if we published this
story in The Nation

786
00:42:27,618 --> 00:42:29,210
that I would be "on thin ice."

787
00:42:29,253 --> 00:42:30,776
That was a direct quote.

788
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,617
And I said, "Well,
I want to know

789
00:42:32,655 --> 00:42:33,953
"how you heard about this story,

790
00:42:33,991 --> 00:42:35,515
and I want to know how
you got my number."

791
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:37,390
And he said, "Let's just say
that I heard about it."

792
00:42:41,798 --> 00:42:43,425
I wasn't sleeping well,

793
00:42:43,467 --> 00:42:45,526
and insomnia fueled my anxiety.

794
00:42:48,038 --> 00:42:49,766
My computer had been hacked

795
00:42:49,805 --> 00:42:51,568
and part of my
hard drive copied.

796
00:42:54,243 --> 00:42:57,235
It was difficult not to feel a
creeping sense of paranoia.

797
00:42:59,915 --> 00:43:01,815
And then I got another
strange phone call.

798
00:43:05,521 --> 00:43:07,455
I had no idea why he called me

799
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:10,288
or how he got my number.

800
00:43:10,326 --> 00:43:12,521
I thought it might be a setup.

801
00:43:12,561 --> 00:43:13,688
Every story I worked on

802
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,789
seemed to trace back to JSOC.

803
00:43:15,832 --> 00:43:17,561
And now, out of the blue,

804
00:43:17,601 --> 00:43:19,932
someone from the inside
was reaching out to me.

805
00:43:23,774 --> 00:43:25,264
I had met operators before

806
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:27,072
in my research on Blackwater

807
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,577
but no one as close to the heart

808
00:43:28,612 --> 00:43:30,443
of JSOC's covert operations.

809
00:43:31,948 --> 00:43:34,508
He sent me photos
of his DoD badges.

810
00:43:34,551 --> 00:43:36,848
But I still couldn't
help wondering,

811
00:43:36,886 --> 00:43:38,854
was I investigating JSOC,

812
00:43:38,888 --> 00:43:40,788
or were they investigating me?

813
00:43:54,837 --> 00:43:56,464
Explain what JSOC is.

814
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,133
[Distorted voice]

815
00:44:12,356 --> 00:44:14,517
What has JSOC been
doing in Yemen?

816
00:44:19,463 --> 00:44:21,954
Targeted killings inside
the borders of Yemen?

817
00:44:40,049 --> 00:44:41,880
Were there ways that
JSOC was being used

818
00:44:41,917 --> 00:44:43,509
that you found objectionable?

819
00:45:34,837 --> 00:45:35,998
Torture?

820
00:45:49,985 --> 00:45:51,647
So you're saying JSOC
is able to hit harder

821
00:45:51,688 --> 00:45:52,814
under President Obama

822
00:45:52,856 --> 00:45:54,517
than they were under
President Bush?

823
00:46:12,107 --> 00:46:13,631
On my last day in Sana'a,

824
00:46:13,676 --> 00:46:15,871
a file had been left
for me at my hotel...

825
00:46:17,213 --> 00:46:20,046
A leaked investigation into
the strike of al-Majalah.

826
00:46:21,417 --> 00:46:23,045
It included a list of the dead.

827
00:46:28,925 --> 00:46:31,189
In Iraq, they had
a deck of cards,

828
00:46:31,228 --> 00:46:33,219
a list of 55 names.

829
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,422
But the cards were not enough.

830
00:46:36,465 --> 00:46:37,932
New lists were needed.

831
00:46:37,967 --> 00:46:39,229
Longer lists.

832
00:46:39,268 --> 00:46:40,497
At the end of each list,

833
00:46:40,537 --> 00:46:42,801
another and another,

834
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:44,430
an endless list of names.

835
00:46:53,516 --> 00:46:56,007
In al-Majalah, the
list numbered 46.

836
00:46:57,219 --> 00:46:59,653
14 of the names were women.

837
00:46:59,688 --> 00:47:02,179
21 were children.

838
00:47:02,224 --> 00:47:03,623
Who were they trying to kill?

839
00:47:06,362 --> 00:47:09,263
A week after al-Majalah,
there was another strike.

840
00:47:09,298 --> 00:47:10,823
And this time, the
Yemeni government

841
00:47:10,867 --> 00:47:13,665
issued a press release
naming the intended targets,

842
00:47:13,703 --> 00:47:16,137
but none of them
had been killed.

843
00:47:16,172 --> 00:47:19,073
For the first time, I had
names on the kill list

844
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:21,703
of people who were still alive.

845
00:47:21,745 --> 00:47:23,939
Two of them were
publicly known leaders:

846
00:47:23,979 --> 00:47:25,776
Shihiri and Waheshi.

847
00:47:25,814 --> 00:47:28,305
But the last name
gave me a chill:

848
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:30,114
Anwar al-Awlaki.

849
00:47:30,153 --> 00:47:31,585
I knew the name,

850
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,520
but I couldn't believe
I was seeing it here

851
00:47:33,556 --> 00:47:35,786
on this list.

852
00:47:35,824 --> 00:47:37,815
Awlaki was an American citizen.

853
00:47:38,961 --> 00:47:40,553
The Christmas Day
bombing attempt

854
00:47:40,596 --> 00:47:42,496
has everybody on alert tonight.

855
00:47:42,531 --> 00:47:44,055
Investigators
connecting the dots,

856
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:46,067
and a key focus in
the investigation

857
00:47:46,101 --> 00:47:47,568
is a radical Islamic cleric.

858
00:47:47,603 --> 00:47:49,400
That man is Anwar al-Awlaki,

859
00:47:49,438 --> 00:47:51,030
an exiled American who was...

860
00:47:51,073 --> 00:47:54,065
Just as I was investigating
the expanding war in Yemen,

861
00:47:54,109 --> 00:47:56,100
it seemed Awlaki's
name was everywhere.

862
00:47:57,447 --> 00:47:59,915
The War on Terror
suddenly had a new face.

863
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:02,077
Radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki

864
00:48:02,118 --> 00:48:03,415
may now be as grave a threat

865
00:48:03,453 --> 00:48:05,580
as Osama bin Laden himself.

866
00:48:05,622 --> 00:48:07,385
Awlaki, Holder says,

867
00:48:07,424 --> 00:48:09,221
is a clear and present danger.

868
00:48:09,259 --> 00:48:11,591
He's an extremely dangerous man.

869
00:48:11,628 --> 00:48:12,992
Does the U.S.
have a preference

870
00:48:13,028 --> 00:48:14,791
in terms of al-Awlaki:

871
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,730
Dead, captured, or prosecuted?

872
00:48:16,765 --> 00:48:18,665
Well, we certainly want
to neutralize him,

873
00:48:18,701 --> 00:48:22,660
and we will do whatever we
can in order to do that.

874
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:25,900
An American was
on the kill list.

875
00:48:27,409 --> 00:48:29,570
It felt to me like we'd
walked off a cliff.

876
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,947
Awlaki had been
sentenced to death

877
00:48:32,982 --> 00:48:34,813
without even being
charged with a crime.

878
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,847
Awlaki's father filed a lawsuit

879
00:48:39,888 --> 00:48:42,083
with the help of the Center
for Constitutional Rights

880
00:48:42,124 --> 00:48:43,716
and the ACLU.

881
00:48:43,759 --> 00:48:45,352
He demanded that the
government provide

882
00:48:45,395 --> 00:48:48,125
whatever evidence they
had against his son.

883
00:48:48,164 --> 00:48:49,654
But the government refused.

884
00:48:49,699 --> 00:48:51,667
They had ordered
the assassination

885
00:48:51,701 --> 00:48:53,191
of a U.S. citizen

886
00:48:53,236 --> 00:48:55,136
but said the evidence
itself was too dangerous

887
00:48:55,171 --> 00:48:56,536
to be made public.

888
00:48:56,573 --> 00:48:59,872
What kind of protections
does this American have

889
00:48:59,909 --> 00:49:02,103
against being assassinated
by his own government?

890
00:49:02,144 --> 00:49:04,442
Yeah, it almost
sounds kind of funny

891
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,606
in an ironic way
when you say that.

892
00:49:06,648 --> 00:49:09,618
You know, you have the right
not to be assassinated.

893
00:49:11,487 --> 00:49:13,011
A bill was introduced
in Congress

894
00:49:13,055 --> 00:49:16,422
to ban the extrajudicial
assassination of Americans,

895
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:18,449
but only six
congressmen signed on.

896
00:49:19,962 --> 00:49:22,226
And the people who should have
known what was happening,

897
00:49:22,264 --> 00:49:24,357
the members of the
intelligence committees,

898
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,560
couldn't tell me anything.

899
00:49:25,601 --> 00:49:27,091
When there is a lethal operation

900
00:49:27,136 --> 00:49:28,933
and a high-value
person is killed,

901
00:49:28,971 --> 00:49:31,132
the president, of course,
acknowledged that we killed-

902
00:49:31,173 --> 00:49:32,334
- He can't-
- Huh?

903
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:38,685
SEN. RON WYDEN
SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

904
00:49:38,982 --> 00:49:40,279
Has there been any legal review

905
00:49:40,316 --> 00:49:41,874
of the potential for
lethal operations

906
00:49:41,918 --> 00:49:43,476
against American citizens?

907
00:49:45,288 --> 00:49:47,119
- Not to our knowledge.
- Is that classified?

908
00:49:48,858 --> 00:49:52,917
It's important for the
American people to know

909
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,260
when the President can
kill an American citizen

910
00:49:56,298 --> 00:49:58,061
and when they can't.

911
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:03,367
And yet it is almost as if
there are two laws in America,

912
00:50:03,405 --> 00:50:05,703
and the American people

913
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:08,835
would be extraordinarily
surprised

914
00:50:08,877 --> 00:50:11,072
if they could see the difference

915
00:50:11,113 --> 00:50:15,174
between what they
believe a law says

916
00:50:15,217 --> 00:50:19,017
and how it has actually
been interpreted in secret.

917
00:50:19,054 --> 00:50:20,352
You're not permitted

918
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:22,255
to disclose that
difference publicly.

919
00:50:22,292 --> 00:50:23,384
That's correct.

920
00:50:42,844 --> 00:50:44,277
I wasn't surprised
when Washington

921
00:50:44,312 --> 00:50:45,746
ignored the killings in Gardez.

922
00:50:47,416 --> 00:50:50,214
But this was an
American citizen.

923
00:50:50,252 --> 00:50:52,652
The country was now
targeting one of its own.

924
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:55,852
Even John Walker Lindh,

925
00:50:55,891 --> 00:50:57,381
who'd taken up arms
with the Taliban,

926
00:50:57,426 --> 00:50:58,552
was given a trial.

927
00:51:00,229 --> 00:51:02,197
What had Awlaki done?

928
00:51:02,231 --> 00:51:04,631
And why was the U.S. willing
to cross such a dangerous line

929
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:05,997
to have him killed?

930
00:51:12,342 --> 00:51:15,470
I read everything I
could about Awlaki.

931
00:51:15,512 --> 00:51:18,140
It was obvious that he was an
immensely popular preacher

932
00:51:18,181 --> 00:51:19,443
with a large following

933
00:51:19,482 --> 00:51:21,040
among young
English-speaking Muslims

934
00:51:21,084 --> 00:51:22,176
around the world.

935
00:51:23,653 --> 00:51:25,120
On his blog, he openly praised

936
00:51:25,155 --> 00:51:27,452
some of the attacks
against the U.S.

937
00:51:27,489 --> 00:51:29,820
But this in itself was
clearly not a crime.

938
00:51:33,046 --> 00:51:35,619
I spoke with former CIA
and military officials.

939
00:51:35,649 --> 00:51:37,120
PHIL GIRALDI
CAREER CIA CASE OFFICER

940
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:38,771
They argued that
Awlaki's speeches

941
00:51:38,801 --> 00:51:40,455
were inspiring
domestic terrorists.

942
00:51:40,485 --> 00:51:42,040
EMILE NAKHLEH
CIA POLITICAL ISLAM DMSION

943
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:43,469
There were a lot of words

944
00:51:43,505 --> 00:51:46,450
COL. PATRICK LANG
DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
from both Awlaki and the U.S.
Government

945
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,035
but no concrete
piece of evidence

946
00:51:48,065 --> 00:51:49,508
LT. COL. ANTHONY SHAFFER
CIA - LEADERSHIP TARGETING CELL
that he was an operational figure

947
00:51:49,538 --> 00:51:51,896
LT. COL. ANTHONY SHAFFER
CIA - LEADERSHIP TARGETING CELL
in any attacks.

948
00:51:52,748 --> 00:51:55,377
I remembered seeing him on
TV nearly a decade earlier,

949
00:51:55,418 --> 00:51:57,045
just after 9/11.

950
00:51:57,449 --> 00:51:58,825
ANWAR AL AWLAKI
FALLS CHURCH, VA - 2001

951
00:51:58,855 --> 00:52:00,322
And it was difficult
to reconcile

952
00:52:00,356 --> 00:52:02,290
the image of a new bin Laden

953
00:52:02,325 --> 00:52:05,192
with Awlaki's earlier sermons
condemning terrorism.

954
00:52:05,228 --> 00:52:10,097
The fact that the U.S.
has administered

955
00:52:10,133 --> 00:52:13,863
the death and homicide
of civilians in Iraq

956
00:52:13,902 --> 00:52:18,668
does not justify the killing
of one U.S. Civilian

957
00:52:18,706 --> 00:52:20,936
in New York City or
Washington, D.C.

958
00:52:23,578 --> 00:52:26,639
For a short time, Awlaki
seemed like the go-to imam

959
00:52:26,682 --> 00:52:28,240
for journalists
trying to understand

960
00:52:28,283 --> 00:52:29,773
the experience of
American Muslims

961
00:52:29,818 --> 00:52:31,308
in the wake of the attacks.

962
00:52:33,188 --> 00:52:35,213
He was even profiled
by the Washington Post

963
00:52:35,257 --> 00:52:36,884
for a piece about Ramadan.

964
00:52:36,925 --> 00:52:38,392
After September 11th...

965
00:52:41,998 --> 00:52:43,761
All of the feelings of
the American Muslims

966
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,768
were similar to everybody
else in America:

967
00:52:45,802 --> 00:52:47,963
Feelings of sympathy

968
00:52:48,004 --> 00:52:52,998
for the families of the victims

969
00:52:53,042 --> 00:52:54,771
and a sense of...

970
00:52:56,346 --> 00:52:58,780
That whoever did this needed
to be brought to justice.

971
00:52:58,815 --> 00:53:02,079
A decade after this
video was filmed,

972
00:53:02,117 --> 00:53:05,018
Awlaki had become Public
Enemy Number One,

973
00:53:05,053 --> 00:53:08,647
his name at the very
top of the kill list.

974
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:11,658
It felt like the War on
Terror was turning on itself.

975
00:53:11,692 --> 00:53:13,126
I was now investigating

976
00:53:13,161 --> 00:53:16,460
the planned assassination
of a U.S. Citizen-

977
00:53:16,498 --> 00:53:17,897
a watershed event.

978
00:53:19,072 --> 00:53:21,158
SANA'A, YEMEN

979
00:53:30,413 --> 00:53:31,607
For the first time,

980
00:53:31,648 --> 00:53:33,741
I had the name of someone
on the kill list

981
00:53:33,783 --> 00:53:35,444
who had not yet been killed.

982
00:53:37,153 --> 00:53:39,621
Anwar al-Awlaki was
now a wanted man

983
00:53:39,656 --> 00:53:41,590
hiding somewhere in the
mountains of Yemen.

984
00:53:46,461 --> 00:53:47,621
I knew I wouldn't be able

985
00:53:47,663 --> 00:53:49,358
to speak with Awlaki directly...

986
00:53:50,999 --> 00:53:53,058
But through a series
of intermediaries,

987
00:53:53,101 --> 00:53:55,126
I managed to set up a
meeting with his father.

988
00:53:58,139 --> 00:54:01,700
I expected him to be reluctant
to speak about his son,

989
00:54:01,742 --> 00:54:03,040
but he seemed happy to reminisce

990
00:54:03,078 --> 00:54:04,238
about an earlier time.

991
00:54:06,014 --> 00:54:09,381
Anwar was an all-American boy.

992
00:54:09,418 --> 00:54:11,613
This is in Disneyland, you know,

993
00:54:11,653 --> 00:54:14,213
in 1984, I think.

994
00:54:16,024 --> 00:54:18,653
This is in San Diego when
he was already an imam

995
00:54:18,695 --> 00:54:20,788
with a big beard, you know.

996
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:23,799
At that time, he was asking
Muslims to participate

997
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:25,801
in the democratic
process in America.

998
00:54:25,835 --> 00:54:29,236
In fact, during the presidential
campaign of George Bush,

999
00:54:29,272 --> 00:54:31,763
he thought the
conservative Republicans

1000
00:54:31,808 --> 00:54:34,640
will be better than the
liberal Democrats,

1001
00:54:34,676 --> 00:54:36,610
and he encouraged
the Muslims there

1002
00:54:36,645 --> 00:54:39,170
to elect George Bush.

1003
00:54:39,214 --> 00:54:40,408
Didn't he even, at one point,

1004
00:54:40,449 --> 00:54:41,848
attend a luncheon
at the Pentagon?

1005
00:54:41,883 --> 00:54:43,009
Yes.

1006
00:54:43,051 --> 00:54:44,950
You see, he liked America,

1007
00:54:44,986 --> 00:54:48,888
and he wanted to stay and
really-his life in America,

1008
00:54:48,923 --> 00:54:50,686
but things came differently.

1009
00:54:54,029 --> 00:54:57,465
Can you explain to me why
your son went into hiding?

1010
00:54:57,499 --> 00:55:00,332
After the incident
of al-Majalah

1011
00:55:00,369 --> 00:55:02,462
and Anwar was all over the news,

1012
00:55:02,504 --> 00:55:05,167
the drones started
to fly over Shabwah.

1013
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:09,668
So, you know, Anwar
was really concerned.

1014
00:55:09,712 --> 00:55:12,510
And so we took his
family with us,

1015
00:55:12,548 --> 00:55:15,346
and he left to the mountains.

1016
00:55:15,385 --> 00:55:16,943
Hmm?

1017
00:55:25,227 --> 00:55:28,890
Myself, at this age in my life,

1018
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:32,798
I really cannot ever replace,

1019
00:55:32,834 --> 00:55:35,165
you know, the role of my son

1020
00:55:35,202 --> 00:55:39,298
as he was doing for his family.

1021
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,899
From my reading of the
history of your son,

1022
00:55:40,942 --> 00:55:42,170
from his writing,

1023
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,178
it seemed as though there
was a transformation

1024
00:55:44,212 --> 00:55:46,544
that happened
politically for him

1025
00:55:46,581 --> 00:55:48,276
from 9/11 to the
invasion of Iraq.

1026
00:55:48,316 --> 00:55:50,443
Something started to
change in his tone.

1027
00:55:50,485 --> 00:55:51,680
Yes.

1028
00:55:51,721 --> 00:55:55,657
Anwar became popular
before September 11th

1029
00:55:55,691 --> 00:55:59,024
because his sermons
and his tapes,

1030
00:55:59,062 --> 00:56:00,359
you know, were very popular

1031
00:56:00,396 --> 00:56:03,524
all over the
English-speaking world.

1032
00:56:03,566 --> 00:56:07,524
And then the invasion
came in 2003,

1033
00:56:07,569 --> 00:56:09,833
and they invaded Iraq
and destroyed Iraq,

1034
00:56:09,871 --> 00:56:11,702
so Anwar really started

1035
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:17,542
to be more vocal in his speeches

1036
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:20,070
against what the
Americans were doing

1037
00:56:20,115 --> 00:56:22,208
against Muslims all
over the world.

1038
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,773
There's no doubt that
your son praised

1039
00:56:23,818 --> 00:56:25,217
some of the attacks
against the U.S.

1040
00:56:25,252 --> 00:56:26,981
And for many Americans,
it was enough to say,

1041
00:56:27,021 --> 00:56:28,420
"Anwar al-Awlaki
is a terrorist."

1042
00:56:28,456 --> 00:56:31,551
But also, I want
decent American lawyer

1043
00:56:31,593 --> 00:56:33,959
to tell me that it is right

1044
00:56:33,995 --> 00:56:35,758
for the United States government

1045
00:56:35,797 --> 00:56:37,731
to kill an American citizen

1046
00:56:37,766 --> 00:56:39,667
on the basis that
he said something

1047
00:56:39,702 --> 00:56:42,796
against the United States or
against American soldiers.

1048
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:44,670
I mean, I-I don't understand.

1049
00:56:44,707 --> 00:56:47,870
I don't understand 100% the
American Constitution,

1050
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:51,209
but I don't believe
American law will allow

1051
00:56:51,247 --> 00:56:53,147
the killing of an
American citizen

1052
00:56:53,182 --> 00:56:56,309
because he said something
against the United States.

1053
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:05,252
Anwar's father may have
been calling for justice

1054
00:57:05,293 --> 00:57:06,851
under American law,

1055
00:57:06,895 --> 00:57:09,728
but American drones were
already flying overhead.

1056
00:57:13,167 --> 00:57:15,635
The fact that they were trying
to kill an American citizen

1057
00:57:15,669 --> 00:57:17,330
was shocking enough.

1058
00:57:17,371 --> 00:57:20,068
But there was another reason
Awlaki's story haunted me.

1059
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:22,342
We are against evil,

1060
00:57:22,377 --> 00:57:24,402
and America as a whole

1061
00:57:24,446 --> 00:57:26,574
has turned into a
nation of evil.

1062
00:57:26,616 --> 00:57:30,518
How can your conscience
allow you to...

1063
00:57:30,553 --> 00:57:32,851
Awlaki seemed to have
embraced the very identity

1064
00:57:32,889 --> 00:57:34,914
he once opposed:

1065
00:57:34,957 --> 00:57:37,551
The military jacket,
the black flag,

1066
00:57:37,593 --> 00:57:39,720
the unequivocal call
for armed jihad.

1067
00:57:39,762 --> 00:57:42,594
I specifically invite the youth

1068
00:57:42,631 --> 00:57:44,565
to either fight in the West

1069
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:46,999
or join their brothers
in the fronts of jihad.

1070
00:57:47,035 --> 00:57:49,333
The all-American boy was gone

1071
00:57:49,371 --> 00:57:51,202
and so was the moderate imam.

1072
00:57:52,641 --> 00:57:53,801
But why?

1073
00:58:13,563 --> 00:58:16,361
Awlaki was deeply affected
by the War on Terror

1074
00:58:16,399 --> 00:58:17,957
both abroad and at home.

1075
00:58:20,269 --> 00:58:21,566
The day after September 11th,

1076
00:58:21,604 --> 00:58:23,902
a woman stumbled into
his mosque in Virginia

1077
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,033
after being beaten
with a baseball bat.

1078
00:58:27,776 --> 00:58:29,368
More than 1,200
Muslims were detained

1079
00:58:29,411 --> 00:58:30,537
across the country.

1080
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:35,215
You have Muslims who
are locked up in jail

1081
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,616
and are left to rot in there.

1082
00:58:37,652 --> 00:58:39,586
There are no charges
brought against them.

1083
00:58:40,455 --> 00:58:41,888
What have you done for them?

1084
00:58:43,425 --> 00:58:45,791
Awlaki resigned from
the mosque soon after

1085
00:58:45,827 --> 00:58:46,987
and left the country.

1086
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:51,227
But the wars in Afghanistan
and Iraq followed.

1087
00:58:51,265 --> 00:58:53,961
And, well, this
is a new kind of-

1088
00:58:54,001 --> 00:58:55,195
a new kind of evil.

1089
00:58:55,236 --> 00:58:58,365
And this-this-this-this-
this crusade...

1090
00:59:00,442 --> 00:59:01,842
Is gonna take a while.

1091
00:59:01,877 --> 00:59:04,004
Awlaki began to see
the expanding wars

1092
00:59:04,046 --> 00:59:06,412
as part of a global
attack against Islam,

1093
00:59:06,449 --> 00:59:09,145
and his sermons reflected
a growing anger.

1094
00:59:09,185 --> 00:59:13,383
We are watching one Muslim
nation fall after another,

1095
00:59:13,422 --> 00:59:16,185
and we're watching,
sitting back,

1096
00:59:16,224 --> 00:59:17,384
doing nothing.

1097
00:59:20,262 --> 00:59:21,627
After 9/11,

1098
00:59:21,663 --> 00:59:23,324
Awlaki was put under
surveillance,

1099
00:59:23,365 --> 00:59:25,060
detained at airports,

1100
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,568
and repeatedly
interrogated by the FBI.

1101
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:30,694
When he returned to Yemen,

1102
00:59:30,739 --> 00:59:33,731
local officials arrested him
on orders from Washington.

1103
00:59:33,775 --> 00:59:35,208
He was locked up for
a year and a half

1104
00:59:35,243 --> 00:59:36,733
without charge

1105
00:59:36,778 --> 00:59:39,644
and spent 17 months in
solitary confinement.

1106
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:42,515
When he was finally released,

1107
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:44,779
Awlaki was a changed man.

1108
00:59:44,818 --> 00:59:47,014
And after JSOC
tried to kill him,

1109
00:59:47,055 --> 00:59:48,648
his transformation was complete.

1110
00:59:48,691 --> 00:59:51,023
Eventually came
to the conclusion

1111
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:54,257
that jihad against America
is binding upon myself...

1112
00:59:54,297 --> 00:59:55,889
This is not a war of choice.

1113
00:59:55,931 --> 00:59:59,298
Just as it is binding on
every other able Muslim.

1114
00:59:59,335 --> 01:00:01,030
This is a war of necessity.

1115
01:00:02,304 --> 01:00:04,397
They seemed like mirror
images of one another,

1116
01:00:04,439 --> 01:00:06,532
strangely distorted,

1117
01:00:06,574 --> 01:00:07,700
America's wars

1118
01:00:07,742 --> 01:00:08,766
and Awlaki's words.

1119
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:09,936
This will not be quick...

1120
01:00:09,978 --> 01:00:11,275
War against Islam and Muslim...

1121
01:00:11,313 --> 01:00:12,405
Nor easy.

1122
01:00:12,447 --> 01:00:14,472
Like a self-fulfilling
prophecy,

1123
01:00:14,516 --> 01:00:16,609
the United States had
helped create the very man

1124
01:00:16,651 --> 01:00:17,913
it was now trying to kill.

1125
01:00:17,952 --> 01:00:19,112
America was my home.

1126
01:00:19,154 --> 01:00:21,145
Those who attacked
America on 9/11

1127
01:00:21,189 --> 01:00:22,486
are plotting to do so again.

1128
01:00:22,524 --> 01:00:23,821
Awlaki's journey,

1129
01:00:23,858 --> 01:00:26,793
from a voice of moderation
to one of retribution,

1130
01:00:26,828 --> 01:00:28,294
cut to the heart of
the larger story

1131
01:00:28,329 --> 01:00:29,455
I was investigating.

1132
01:00:29,496 --> 01:00:31,623
[Indistinct conversations]

1133
01:00:31,665 --> 01:00:34,133
Anybody...

1134
01:00:34,168 --> 01:00:35,967
Anybody belongs to al-Qaeda...

1135
01:00:37,707 --> 01:00:39,868
I'd seen the same
pattern repeatedly.

1136
01:00:41,677 --> 01:00:43,474
America was trying to
kill its way to victory.

1137
01:00:43,512 --> 01:00:45,036
Now got a new target list...

1138
01:00:45,081 --> 01:00:47,140
But the War on Terror was
producing new enemies

1139
01:00:47,183 --> 01:00:48,342
wherever it spread.

1140
01:00:48,383 --> 01:00:49,543
How did this grow?

1141
01:00:56,624 --> 01:00:58,387
How does a war like
that ever end?

1142
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,525
Good evening.

1143
01:01:07,569 --> 01:01:10,333
Tonight, I can report
to the American people

1144
01:01:10,372 --> 01:01:11,896
and to the world

1145
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,238
that the United States has
conducted an operation

1146
01:01:14,275 --> 01:01:16,573
that killed Osama bin Laden,

1147
01:01:16,611 --> 01:01:18,669
the leader of al-Qaeda.

1148
01:01:18,712 --> 01:01:20,145
Again, for those
just joining us,

1149
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,375
Osama bin Laden is dead,

1150
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:24,214
and one confirmation
we're getting

1151
01:01:24,252 --> 01:01:28,815
indicates that this is a
special operations raid.

1152
01:01:28,858 --> 01:01:30,291
And I think an organization

1153
01:01:30,326 --> 01:01:32,123
we're gonna hear a lot
about in the coming days

1154
01:01:32,161 --> 01:01:35,755
is JSOC, the Joint Special
Operations Command.

1155
01:01:35,797 --> 01:01:37,594
So much for secrecy.

1156
01:01:37,632 --> 01:01:38,929
So much for cover-ups.

1157
01:01:38,967 --> 01:01:41,902
The forces I'd been trying
to unmask since Gardez

1158
01:01:41,936 --> 01:01:43,369
were suddenly national heroes.

1159
01:01:43,405 --> 01:01:46,499
The operation was
called Neptune Spear.

1160
01:01:46,541 --> 01:01:49,476
To capture or kill bin Laden.

1161
01:01:49,511 --> 01:01:52,036
It felt like the world
had turned upside down.

1162
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,674
JSOC, long shrouded in secrecy,

1163
01:01:54,716 --> 01:01:56,377
was becoming a household name.

1164
01:01:58,186 --> 01:01:59,517
But what did it really mean?

1165
01:02:01,689 --> 01:02:03,088
The White House
circulated a photo

1166
01:02:03,124 --> 01:02:04,614
from the night of the raid,

1167
01:02:04,659 --> 01:02:07,286
perhaps as a picture
of transparency.

1168
01:02:07,327 --> 01:02:09,056
Everyone was in the room:

1169
01:02:09,096 --> 01:02:10,428
Secretary of State,

1170
01:02:10,465 --> 01:02:11,796
Secretary of Defense,

1171
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:13,095
Vice President,

1172
01:02:13,134 --> 01:02:14,727
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs,

1173
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:16,397
the President himself.

1174
01:02:16,439 --> 01:02:17,804
But it was the
seating arrangement

1175
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,205
that interested me.

1176
01:02:19,241 --> 01:02:20,435
The man at the head of the table

1177
01:02:20,476 --> 01:02:22,466
wasn't the commander in chief.

1178
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:24,603
It was McRaven's
assistant at JSOC,

1179
01:02:24,646 --> 01:02:26,307
General Webb.

1180
01:02:26,347 --> 01:02:29,339
McRaven himself was running the
operation from Afghanistan.

1181
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:35,419
USA! USA! USA! USA!

1182
01:02:35,457 --> 01:02:37,584
I wasn't mourning
bin Laden's death,

1183
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:39,252
but I wasn't celebrating either.

1184
01:02:40,995 --> 01:02:44,692
After ten years, I understood
that people wanted closure.

1185
01:02:44,732 --> 01:02:47,394
But it didn't feel
like V-E Day to me.

1186
01:02:47,435 --> 01:02:48,925
Didn't feel like victory at all.

1187
01:02:53,141 --> 01:02:54,631
The leader of
al-Qaeda is dead,

1188
01:02:54,676 --> 01:02:57,200
but a new one has
taken his place.

1189
01:02:57,244 --> 01:03:00,271
Your mission will be to
ensure he meets the same end.

1190
01:03:00,315 --> 01:03:01,942
Hearing JSOC mentioned
on television

1191
01:03:01,983 --> 01:03:03,747
was jolting enough,

1192
01:03:03,786 --> 01:03:06,346
but when I saw the admiral
in front of the cameras,

1193
01:03:06,388 --> 01:03:08,686
it felt like I'd walked
through the looking glass.

1194
01:03:08,724 --> 01:03:11,521
I am deeply honored that the
President has nominated me

1195
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:13,584
to serve as the next
SOCOM commander.

1196
01:03:13,628 --> 01:03:15,061
And if confirmed...

1197
01:03:15,096 --> 01:03:17,155
William McRaven was now
the toast of Washington.

1198
01:03:17,198 --> 01:03:19,325
Admiral McRaven,

1199
01:03:19,367 --> 01:03:21,665
by leading the mission that
killed Osama bin Laden,

1200
01:03:21,703 --> 01:03:24,467
you and your men won
an enduring place

1201
01:03:24,506 --> 01:03:26,531
in American military history.

1202
01:03:26,574 --> 01:03:29,202
Like all of my colleagues,

1203
01:03:29,244 --> 01:03:31,610
I salute you and
your colleagues'

1204
01:03:31,646 --> 01:03:33,876
and the SEALs'
extraordinary operations.

1205
01:03:33,915 --> 01:03:35,644
Thank you for your service.
Thank you, sir.

1206
01:03:35,683 --> 01:03:37,173
When the congratulations
subsided,

1207
01:03:37,218 --> 01:03:40,187
the senators turned to the
real purpose of the hearings.

1208
01:03:40,221 --> 01:03:43,281
Are you prepared and capable
to expand your operations

1209
01:03:43,324 --> 01:03:45,690
at a moment's notice worldwide?

1210
01:03:45,727 --> 01:03:48,696
As we look out from
Iraq, Afghanistan,

1211
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:50,698
and, frankly, across the globe,

1212
01:03:50,732 --> 01:03:53,133
as we look at hot spots in Yemen

1213
01:03:53,168 --> 01:03:55,159
where you have al-Qaeda
in the Arabian Peninsula

1214
01:03:55,204 --> 01:03:57,068
or Somalia where you have
East African al-Qaeda

1215
01:03:57,105 --> 01:03:58,367
and al-Shabaab,

1216
01:03:58,406 --> 01:03:59,873
now, these are clearly
areas of concern...

1217
01:03:59,908 --> 01:04:01,170
People in the streets
may have hoped

1218
01:04:01,209 --> 01:04:03,336
the War on Terror
was finally over.

1219
01:04:03,378 --> 01:04:04,675
But in Washington,

1220
01:04:04,712 --> 01:04:06,339
in the corridors of power,

1221
01:04:06,381 --> 01:04:08,110
a new chapter had just begun.

1222
01:04:10,885 --> 01:04:13,479
Right now, it's kinetic.
Hard kill.

1223
01:04:13,521 --> 01:04:15,819
If it's not hard kill,
doesn't get played.

1224
01:04:16,646 --> 01:04:18,296
MALCOLM NANCE
NAVAL INTELLIGENCE

1225
01:04:18,326 --> 01:04:19,884
Soon after the bin Laden strike,

1226
01:04:19,928 --> 01:04:21,122
I met Malcolm Nance,

1227
01:04:21,162 --> 01:04:23,096
a legend in the
world of covert ops

1228
01:04:23,131 --> 01:04:24,564
who'd trained
countless Navy SEALs

1229
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:27,193
and other JSOC operators.

1230
01:04:27,235 --> 01:04:29,362
I'm a firm believer in
targeted assassination.

1231
01:04:29,404 --> 01:04:32,374
If they are too strong
for your ability

1232
01:04:32,408 --> 01:04:35,069
to negate their capacity
in the battlefield,

1233
01:04:35,109 --> 01:04:37,737
then you're just gonna
have to put a hellfire in.

1234
01:04:37,779 --> 01:04:39,576
If they're- if
they are dangerous

1235
01:04:39,614 --> 01:04:40,638
on a strategic scale

1236
01:04:40,682 --> 01:04:43,173
like Anwar al-Awlaki
from Yemen-

1237
01:04:43,217 --> 01:04:45,082
definitely has a
missile in his future.

1238
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:47,280
No longer cloaked in secrecy,

1239
01:04:47,322 --> 01:04:48,653
special ops seemed
to be enjoying

1240
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:50,248
their moment in the sun.

1241
01:04:50,291 --> 01:04:52,384
You know, we went in, we
did the drone strike,

1242
01:04:52,427 --> 01:04:54,088
and-or hellfire strike,

1243
01:04:54,128 --> 01:04:55,595
and we blasted the
individual car

1244
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:57,757
of a known guy who was known
to be in that vehicle.

1245
01:04:57,799 --> 01:04:59,596
And we flew in, and
we snatched his body-

1246
01:04:59,634 --> 01:05:01,761
we confirmed it- got the
intelligence, went away.

1247
01:05:01,803 --> 01:05:03,395
That's the way we
should be doing it.

1248
01:05:08,977 --> 01:05:10,604
The first time we met,

1249
01:05:10,645 --> 01:05:13,011
he'd called me out of the blue.

1250
01:05:13,047 --> 01:05:14,537
This time, it was me who called.

1251
01:05:16,985 --> 01:05:19,819
JSOC may no longer
have been a secret,

1252
01:05:19,855 --> 01:05:21,516
but that didn't mean
we knew the truth.

1253
01:05:48,049 --> 01:05:50,210
But, in theory, Congress is
supposed to have oversight

1254
01:05:50,251 --> 01:05:51,411
of these operations.

1255
01:06:29,023 --> 01:06:31,890
Bin Laden's death had given
the War on Terror new life.

1256
01:06:34,796 --> 01:06:37,993
After 9/11, there were seven
people on the kill list.

1257
01:06:38,032 --> 01:06:40,865
In Iraq, 55 on the
deck of cards.

1258
01:06:40,902 --> 01:06:42,893
By Afghanistan, there
were thousands.

1259
01:06:44,739 --> 01:06:47,367
But now the list
itself was changing.

1260
01:06:47,408 --> 01:06:48,773
Signature strikes,

1261
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:49,799
TADS,

1262
01:06:49,844 --> 01:06:51,675
crowd killing-

1263
01:06:51,713 --> 01:06:53,442
a target list was
no longer needed

1264
01:06:53,481 --> 01:06:55,507
to justify a strike
like al-Majalah.

1265
01:06:56,819 --> 01:06:58,684
All boys over the age of 15,

1266
01:06:58,721 --> 01:07:00,620
all men under the age of 70

1267
01:07:00,655 --> 01:07:02,987
were now fair game
in targeted areas.

1268
01:07:04,958 --> 01:07:06,448
Like a flywheel,

1269
01:07:06,493 --> 01:07:09,054
the global War on Terror was
spinning out of control.

1270
01:07:18,806 --> 01:07:20,273
When I began this story,

1271
01:07:20,308 --> 01:07:22,776
the U.S. was at war in
Iraq and Afghanistan.

1272
01:07:24,145 --> 01:07:26,272
The bombing in al-Majalah
brought me to Yemen.

1273
01:07:27,115 --> 01:07:28,548
But the list of countries

1274
01:07:28,583 --> 01:07:31,313
where U.S. Special Forces
were operating had grown,

1275
01:07:31,352 --> 01:07:33,047
just as the kill list had.

1276
01:07:34,489 --> 01:07:36,013
Algeria, Indonesia,

1277
01:07:36,057 --> 01:07:39,390
Thailand, Panama, Jordan-

1278
01:07:39,427 --> 01:07:41,361
the world was now a battlefield.

1279
01:07:43,198 --> 01:07:46,133
It was hard to know
where to go next.

1280
01:07:46,168 --> 01:07:49,159
In Pakistan, the U.S. was
launching weekly drone strikes.

1281
01:07:49,203 --> 01:07:51,500
In Mali, they were
hunting al-Qaeda.

1282
01:07:51,538 --> 01:07:54,234
In Latin America,
targeting drug cartels.

1283
01:07:55,509 --> 01:07:57,534
I decided to go to Somalia,

1284
01:07:57,577 --> 01:07:59,205
where an escalated
kill/capture program

1285
01:07:59,247 --> 01:08:00,407
was under way.

1286
01:08:07,822 --> 01:08:09,949
Just as McRaven had testified,

1287
01:08:09,991 --> 01:08:12,084
the war was erupting
in East Africa.

1288
01:08:13,694 --> 01:08:15,662
Drone strikes were increasing.

1289
01:08:15,696 --> 01:08:18,460
There were suicide bombings
in Kampala and Mogadishu.

1290
01:08:18,499 --> 01:08:20,228
And JSOC was on the ground,

1291
01:08:20,268 --> 01:08:22,236
snatching bodies and
flying them back to ships

1292
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:23,612
in the Arabian Sea.

1293
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:25,936
ADEN ADDE AIRPORT
MOGADISHU, SOMALIA

1294
01:08:26,941 --> 01:08:28,738
Almost as soon as I arrived,

1295
01:08:28,776 --> 01:08:30,574
I sensed that things
weren't going to go well.

1296
01:08:34,049 --> 01:08:36,984
Mogadishu was seeing its
worst fighting in years,

1297
01:08:37,019 --> 01:08:39,247
and there were no foreign
journalists left in the city.

1298
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:42,388
My local contact, Bashir Osman,

1299
01:08:42,422 --> 01:08:44,049
was worried about my safety.

1300
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:45,057
Okay?

1301
01:08:45,091 --> 01:08:46,319
It's okay.

1302
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:47,418
All right.

1303
01:08:53,267 --> 01:08:54,894
It was a strange feeling,

1304
01:08:54,936 --> 01:08:56,301
traveling with a dozen armed men

1305
01:08:56,337 --> 01:08:57,497
in a decoy car.

1306
01:08:58,806 --> 01:09:00,774
I still had my
reporter's notebook,

1307
01:09:00,808 --> 01:09:03,140
but what could I learn in
conditions like these?

1308
01:09:10,585 --> 01:09:13,053
Before arriving in Somalia,
I had read reports

1309
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:15,055
that the U.S. was
outsourcing the kill lists

1310
01:09:15,089 --> 01:09:16,887
to local warlords.

1311
01:09:19,895 --> 01:09:21,886
Among the most
powerful in Mogadishu

1312
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:23,727
was Yusuf Mohamed Siad,

1313
01:09:23,765 --> 01:09:25,823
known by everyone as Indha Adde,

1314
01:09:25,867 --> 01:09:27,390
"White Eyes."

1315
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:33,337
GEN. INDHA ADDE
US-BACKED SOMALI ARMY

1316
01:09:35,942 --> 01:09:38,969
In an earlier life, Indha Adde
had been America's enemy,

1317
01:09:39,013 --> 01:09:42,414
offering protection to people
on the U.S. kill list.

1318
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:44,350
But the warlord had
since changed sides.

1319
01:09:44,385 --> 01:09:46,945
He was now on the U.S. payroll

1320
01:09:46,988 --> 01:09:49,252
and assumed the
title of general.

1321
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:51,019
So he's saying that
the fiercest fighting

1322
01:09:51,058 --> 01:09:53,390
that they're doing right now
is happening right here.

1323
01:09:56,864 --> 01:09:57,956
Okay.

1324
01:10:07,342 --> 01:10:09,833
The men fired across
the rooftops,

1325
01:10:09,878 --> 01:10:12,277
but it didn't make sense to
me what we were doing here...

1326
01:10:13,748 --> 01:10:16,181
Or what the Americans were
doing here in Somalia,

1327
01:10:16,216 --> 01:10:18,013
arming this
warlord-turned-general

1328
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:20,485
for what seemed like
a senseless war.

1329
01:10:21,988 --> 01:10:23,148
We got to move.

1330
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:32,060
So these were Shabaab
fighters you buried here?

1331
01:10:32,099 --> 01:10:33,367
Yes, two, uh-huh.

1332
01:10:33,397 --> 01:10:38,694
If we capture foreign
fighters alive, we bury them.

1333
01:10:38,861 --> 01:10:40,696
We kill them
when we catch them.

1334
01:10:41,075 --> 01:10:42,599
If you capture a
foreigner alive,

1335
01:10:42,643 --> 01:10:44,133
you execute them on
the battlefield?

1336
01:10:44,658 --> 01:10:45,826
Yes.

1337
01:10:46,744 --> 01:10:51,498
So that other
foreigners expect no mercy.

[Indistinct conversations]

1339
01:11:05,131 --> 01:11:07,463
How did the Americans
find men like Indha Adde?

1340
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,831
And to what end?

1341
01:11:11,171 --> 01:11:12,968
After a decade of covert war,

1342
01:11:13,006 --> 01:11:14,736
Somalia was in ruins.

1343
01:11:14,775 --> 01:11:16,402
Half the country was ruled

1344
01:11:16,444 --> 01:11:17,911
by the local
al-Qaeda affiliate,

1345
01:11:17,945 --> 01:11:20,243
the other half by men
like the general,

1346
01:11:20,281 --> 01:11:22,647
wandering the streets
with an endless kill list

1347
01:11:22,683 --> 01:11:23,843
and a band of men.

[Indistinct conversations]

1349
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:32,118
Every time we stopped,

1350
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:33,626
people looked at us nervously,

1351
01:11:33,661 --> 01:11:35,458
and I was told that
my very presence

1352
01:11:35,496 --> 01:11:37,930
was endangering them.

1353
01:11:37,965 --> 01:11:40,935
Bashir would insist we leave
moments after we arrived.

1354
01:11:42,037 --> 01:11:43,163
Okay, we go.

1355
01:11:48,442 --> 01:11:51,070
I wanted to see beneath
the surface of the war

1356
01:11:51,112 --> 01:11:53,909
to understand what it meant
to ordinary Somalis.

[Indistinct conversations]

But I was passed from
warlord to warlord

1359
01:11:58,084 --> 01:11:59,551
and soon realized
the only people

1360
01:11:59,586 --> 01:12:01,918
I'd be able to meet
were men with guns.

1361
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:13,337
MOHAMMED QANYARE
US-BACKED WARLORD

1362
01:12:13,367 --> 01:12:14,834
For years, Mohamed Qanyare

1363
01:12:14,869 --> 01:12:16,837
was Washington's
man in Mogadishu.

1364
01:12:16,871 --> 01:12:19,203
His methods were extreme,

1365
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,037
but Washington insisted
Qanyare's services

1366
01:12:21,075 --> 01:12:22,667
were vital to their
kill campaign.

1367
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:23,972
Who were the people

1368
01:12:24,011 --> 01:12:26,071
that the Americans wanted
your help tracking?

1369
01:12:27,916 --> 01:12:29,042
You don't want to
talk about that.

1370
01:12:30,052 --> 01:12:32,542
Did they offer to
fund any operations?

1371
01:12:35,222 --> 01:12:36,280
You don't want to
comment on that.

1372
01:12:37,224 --> 01:12:39,158
But you're targeting
people for the Americans.

1373
01:12:45,231 --> 01:12:46,698
And when these
American operations

1374
01:12:46,733 --> 01:12:48,894
kill innocent people,
what's the impact?

1375
01:13:21,502 --> 01:13:23,493
They're all being taken
to Madina Hospital?

1376

For over a decade,

1377
01:13:59,306 --> 01:14:02,708
JSOC and the CIA had
free rein in Somalia.

1378

All their tactics
were on display-

1379
01:14:04,946 --> 01:14:08,278
drone strikes, night
raids, mercenaries.

1380
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:12,683
As the War on Terror
entered a second decade,

1381
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:15,780
Somalia seemed like a
laboratory of the future,

1382
01:14:15,823 --> 01:14:17,450

But the news from home
what not what I expected.

authorized by the
President himself.

from the list.

Two weeks after

had been killed.

But this time, it
was a teenage boy.

01:15:41,942 --> 01:15:43,876
Was it to file another story?

01:15:43,911 --> 01:15:46,004
To investigate another crime?

1407
01:15:47,014 --> 01:15:48,811
Or was it to apologize?

1408
01:16:12,339 --> 01:16:14,773
Abdulrahman left
without telling us.

1409
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:18,307
He said in a small note

1410
01:16:18,345 --> 01:16:20,779
that he's going to
look for his father.

1411
01:16:22,383 --> 01:16:25,012
He left from the kitchen window,

1412
01:16:25,053 --> 01:16:28,215
and he took a bus to the
governorate of Shabwah.

1413
01:16:29,757 --> 01:16:31,622
Then when his father was killed,

1414
01:16:31,659 --> 01:16:34,093
his grandmother told him,

1415
01:16:34,128 --> 01:16:36,790
"There is no use for
you to stay anymore."

1416
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:40,027
And he said, "Yes, I will
come back in two days."

1417
01:16:45,506 --> 01:16:51,205
On the morning of October 15th,

1418
01:16:51,244 --> 01:16:52,734
we got a telephone call,

1419
01:16:52,779 --> 01:16:55,907
and they told us he was
blown up to pieces

1420
01:16:55,948 --> 01:16:57,415
by the drone.

1421
01:16:58,651 --> 01:17:01,120
And they saw only the
back of his hair.

1422
01:17:01,155 --> 01:17:02,952
You know, his
relative, his cousin,

1423
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:04,753
he knew his hair from the back,

1424
01:17:04,792 --> 01:17:07,317
and he recognize it, and he knew

1425
01:17:07,361 --> 01:17:10,194
that Abdulrahman
really was dead.

1426
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:13,427
But they could not recognize
his face or anything else.

1427
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:17,830
I always teased with him

1428
01:17:17,871 --> 01:17:20,339
about his, you know, big-

1429
01:17:20,374 --> 01:17:22,433
his hair, you know,
that he should cut it,

1430
01:17:22,476 --> 01:17:24,376
because I thought that
he should do that.

1431
01:17:29,249 --> 01:17:31,444
The drone had not
just killed the boy,

1432
01:17:31,485 --> 01:17:32,816
it vanished him.

1433
01:17:34,822 --> 01:17:37,289
I asked to see photos
of Abdulrahman

1434
01:17:37,323 --> 01:17:39,120
and suddenly realized
why I was here.

1435
01:17:42,595 --> 01:17:45,291
It wasn't to investigate
another death.

1436
01:17:45,331 --> 01:17:47,822
I wanted to see him when
he was still alive.

1437
01:17:47,867 --> 01:17:50,837
[Indistinct conversations]

1438
01:18:28,941 --> 01:18:31,307
Abdulrahman's grandmother
was in mourning

1439
01:18:31,344 --> 01:18:34,279
but sat down with me
for a moment to talk.

1440
01:18:34,313 --> 01:18:35,974
What did Abdulrahman do?

1441
01:18:37,284 --> 01:18:40,685
Who ordered the killing
of Abdulrahman?

1442
01:18:40,721 --> 01:18:43,815
He was sitting, having
dinner with his friends.

1443
01:18:43,857 --> 01:18:45,485
How come he was killed?

1444
01:18:45,527 --> 01:18:46,891
What did he do?

1445
01:18:48,195 --> 01:18:49,685
You know, Abdulrahman was...

1446
01:18:51,031 --> 01:18:53,556
He was a very, very gentle boy,

1447
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,625
and he never hurt anybody.

1448
01:19:15,188 --> 01:19:17,554
I tried to make sense
of Abdulrahman's death.

1449
01:19:20,226 --> 01:19:22,694
His father's could at
least be explained.

1450
01:19:22,728 --> 01:19:24,423
But a teenager with
a Facebook page

1451
01:19:24,464 --> 01:19:27,263
and a group of
adolescent friends,

1452
01:19:27,301 --> 01:19:30,429
why would his name have
been put on the list?

1453
01:19:30,471 --> 01:19:32,234
What could he
possibly have done?

1454
01:19:42,616 --> 01:19:43,742
The Americans said

1455
01:19:43,784 --> 01:19:46,753
Abdulrahman was
collateral damage,

1456
01:19:46,787 --> 01:19:49,187
but they offered no
explanation for the strike.

1457
01:19:50,924 --> 01:19:53,757
And unlike Gardez,
they made no apology.

1458
01:19:57,064 --> 01:19:59,055
It seemed an impossible
coincidence.

1459
01:20:00,567 --> 01:20:02,194
They killed the father

1460
01:20:02,236 --> 01:20:03,396
and then the son.

1461
01:20:12,378 --> 01:20:14,608
But maybe it was
as simple as that.

1462
01:20:16,517 --> 01:20:19,509
Like a tale from
Greek mythology,

1463
01:20:19,553 --> 01:20:22,420
Abdulrahman was killed
not for what he'd done

1464
01:20:22,456 --> 01:20:24,515
but for who he might
one day become...

1465
01:20:26,493 --> 01:20:28,484
A twisted logic,

1466
01:20:28,529 --> 01:20:30,121
a logic without end.

1467
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:44,401
Nasser had lost
his firstborn son

1468
01:20:44,444 --> 01:20:46,605
and his first grandson.

1469
01:20:46,647 --> 01:20:49,480
But what did we lose
when the drone struck

1470
01:20:49,516 --> 01:20:51,848
Abdulrahman and his
teenage friends?

1471
01:21:17,144 --> 01:21:20,113
When I first visited Gardez,

1472
01:21:20,147 --> 01:21:22,377
I had no idea where the
story would lead me.

1473
01:21:28,956 --> 01:21:31,481
I didn't know just how much
the world had changed...

1474
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,751
Or how much the journey
would change me.

1475
01:21:42,668 --> 01:21:45,159
But I realize now the
story has no end.

1476
01:21:52,645 --> 01:21:55,274
Somehow, in front of our eyes,

1477
01:21:55,315 --> 01:21:56,942
undeclared wars
have been launched

1478
01:21:56,984 --> 01:22:00,112
in countries across the globe,

1479
01:22:00,153 --> 01:22:02,417
foreigners and citizens
alike assassinated

1480
01:22:02,456 --> 01:22:03,753
by presidential decree...

1481
01:22:05,892 --> 01:22:07,689
The War on Terror transformed

1482
01:22:07,728 --> 01:22:09,696
into a self-fulfilling
prophecy.

1483
01:22:12,265 --> 01:22:14,256
How does a war like
this ever end?

1484
01:22:17,838 --> 01:22:19,601
And what happens to us

1485
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:22,108
when we finally see what's
hidden in plain sight?

1486
01:26:06,732 --> 01:26:08,732
END
