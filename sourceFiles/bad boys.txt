1
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,800
What's this "having a picnic"
in my car?

2
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,200
I'm not getting sex at home.
Don't deny me this.

3
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,700
You sleep with
a beautiful woman nightly.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,500
"Married" means you sleep together,
but you can't get none.

5
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,400
Watch it with all that shit,
all right?

6
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,000
Where are your cup holders?

7
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,300
I don't have one.

8
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,800
$80,000 for this car
and there's no cup holder?

9
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,300
It's $105,000, and it's one of
the fastest cars on earth.

10
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,100
<i>0 to 60 in 4 seconds.</i>

11
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,200
- It's a limited edition.
- You damn right!

12
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,200
No cup holder, no back seat.

13
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,800
It's a shiny dick
with 2 chairs in it.

14
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,900
I guess we the balls,
just dragging along.

15
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Damn!

16
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Sorry.

17
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,000
Get it.

18
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,200
I can't get down there.
You got an engineering flaw.

19
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,100
My shit ain't going down
up in there.

20
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,400
Go!
Titty-titty, strutty-strutty.

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Make them want it.

22
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,700
I ain't cleaning up after you.

23
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,900
My hand can't get down there.
When it does, it gets stuck.

24
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,400
Then you got this shit.

25
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,700
Get that fry.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,800
This ain't Denny's!

27
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,400
I wouldn't buy from Denny's.
I don't like how we been treated.

28
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,900
They bit.
Let's gank these fools!

29
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,000
You ain't interested in the fry.
You all up in that.

30
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,200
Get out.

31
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,300
Shit!

32
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,100
- What the fuck?!
- We've had a big week.

33
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,200
So get out of the car.

34
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Damn!
What you weigh, 350?

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You're a chicken-eating fucker, right?

36
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,700
Why I always get
the big motherfuckers?

37
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,200
Get out!

38
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,800
All right! All right!

39
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,700
Hold on!

40
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,900
Funny! Let me tell you
how bad a day you're having.

41
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,800
We're cops.

42
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,100
And I'm a standup comedian...

43
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,900
...and I suck!
So I need your car.

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,300
I ain't Wesley Snipes.

45
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,000
I just hang out with stupid friends
who drive cars...

46
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,400
...that attract fucking attention!

47
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,700
I need to jump over this car
and smack you in the head.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,900
- You're arguing over a fry!
- It's not about that.

49
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,400
It's your disrespect
for my property!

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,300
- Hey, hey!
- Shut up!

51
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,700
This is stupid!
Hold the fuck on!

52
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,100
If you want some bad enough,
come get some!

53
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,900
You like that shit?

54
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,600
Wesley Snipes, <i>Passenger 57</i>.

55
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,800
Now get me a fucking Handi Wipe.

56
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,600
Let's hear a joke, bitch!

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,300
What do you think?
Looks like the real thing.

58
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,100
Remember your assignment?

59
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm a decoy.

60
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,800
You are.

61
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,600
What are you doing?!

62
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,500
Police?

63
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,100
I just saw a policeman shot...

64
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,500
...at South Miami and 1st Street.
Help, please!

65
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,100
<i>All units. Officer down.</i>

66
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,700
<i>A squad code 3.</i>

67
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,900
<i>All units respond and identify.</i>

68
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,000
<i>Officer down.</i>
<i>We need additional ground units.</i>

69
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,400
<i>Air 3, Roger.</i>
<i>Suspect or suspects unknown.</i>

70
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,200
<i>Gentlemen, it's clear.</i>

71
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,900
<i>We're inside.</i>

72
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,700
We're in.

73
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,600
You got 20 minutes.

74
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,600
Goddamn tacos will kill me.

75
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,300
<i>We got 12 minutes.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

76
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,500
Clear. We're in.

77
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,400
<i>Move your ass.</i>
<i>We got 6 minutes.</i>

78
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,600
Ready.

79
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,700
Ready to fire.
Go!

80
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,200
<i>Fire!</i>

81
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,000
Go!

82
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
Move!

83
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,300
Damn!

84
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,800
Did you have sweet dreams?

85
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You're so nasty.

86
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,400
You always saying
you want quality time.

87
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I got the time and you
damn sure got the quality.

88
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,300
Come on now.

89
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,500
You know what it is?

90
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,200
I can't remember the last time
we fell asleep together.

91
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,900
Baby...

92
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,900
It's my job.

93
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,400
That's required.

94
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,800
I'm a better cop when
I get some in the morning.

95
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,500
I feel lighter on my feet.

96
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Keep it in your pants.
I hear 3 little Burnetts coming.

97
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,300
That's cold.

98
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,600
You leave me here
like a humping dog.

99
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,100
Hi, baby boy!

100
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,200
- Daddy! Daddy!
- What's up?

101
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,600
At school, people say I look weird.
They say my ears look funny.

102
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,700
I have that problem, I got the ears.
But you know what?

103
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,200
They for you to listen
to people's problems.

104
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,000
You're an angel.
These are your wings.

105
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,500
James, stop!
Would you take them off?

106
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,500
Don't make me come to your school.
I'll arrest the principal.

107
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,800
Talking about my boy's ears.

108
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,800
Uncle Mike's in the house!

109
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,500
What's up?

110
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,500
Partner, partner!

111
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Check it out.

112
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,700
What'd you take my food for?

113
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,500
Don't! I don't know where
your lips were last night.

114
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,800
Did you have a date last night?

115
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,800
Did I!

116
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,900
Let me tell you.
This girl was--

117
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,500
Don't tell my son
your sleazy sex stories.

118
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,500
I only tell your husband
my sleazy sex stories.

119
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,000
Him neither.
It gives him ideas.

120
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,700
Why put me in this?
I'm with my babies.

121
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,100
Okay? Thank you.

122
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,800
Eat. Go on!

123
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,300
No problem.

124
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Mike here.

125
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,700
Captain, I think you mean,
"Get our asses down there, please."

126
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,600
Maybe not.

127
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,000
Hey, baby!

128
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,100
Where's Howard?

129
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,300
He's looking for you.
He's been in better moods.

130
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,800
Damn!

131
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,300
Get it done, goddamn it!

132
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,500
Welcome to our nightmare.

133
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,200
See this?

134
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
What's wrong with this picture?

135
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,800
Remember this room?

136
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,900
These flats look familiar?

137
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,300
There were these silver packets
that looked like bricks.

138
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,800
Little red tags on them,
about so high?

139
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,400
All that heroin, gone!

140
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Our career bust.
$100 million!

141
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,600
- Gone!
- This is bad.

142
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,200
Let me call it what it is:
Fucked up!

143
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,000
You got that right.

144
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,900
Hello, Alison.

145
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,900
You know Captain Sinclair,
Internal Affairs's top watchdog.

146
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,800
I'd take that as a compliment,
but I know you.

147
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,800
If you two want to get personal,
we could step out--

148
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,800
It's nothing personal.
I'm just doing my job.

149
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,200
I know one leak can turn
this nightmare into a media frenzy.

150
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,100
That won't happen.
We'll get the dope back before that.

151
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,700
Start by looking here.
It had to be an inside job.

152
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,000
I'll find out about it.

153
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,100
Sanchez, Ruiz, you're late.

154
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,800
So they put this in for
toxic drug fumes?

155
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,400
Brilliant design!

156
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
This was intelligent.
I like this.

157
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,500
I didn't ask how he feels.
What did he see?

158
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,000
What does he know?

159
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,500
Where were you last night?

160
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Have your cousins bring it back
and we can sleep.

161
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,800
We were going to,
but we found a problem.

162
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Your mama snorted up all the dope.

163
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,100
Get over there.

164
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,200
O'Fee is okay
but has nothing to tell us.

165
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,000
They kill a decoy, it empties
the station. Very smart!

166
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,500
But not a real cop, or the
whole force would be on them.

167
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,200
This was your case.
You're back on it.

168
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,000
Sanchez, Ruiz, back them up
with whatever they need.

169
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,100
Shut your mouths!

170
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,800
It was Carrera's drugs
in the first place.

171
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,300
But he was killed in prison.
What about his crew?

172
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,700
Those idiots don't have
the precision to do this.

173
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,500
But check them out.

174
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,700
They would have been
in here with Uzis.

175
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,500
It takes brains do this.

176
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,800
Big <i>cojones</i> too.

177
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,600
What do you mean?

178
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,300
It would take a month to explain.

179
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,200
We've got nothing.
What's the matter with you?

180
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,700
The guy who pulled this off
knew what he was doing.

181
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,300
He left us a big "Fuck you."

182
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,300
Find out who installed
the ventilating system.

183
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,700
- That's cold.
- So's your mama's bed.

184
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,100
This could definitely be
an inside job.

185
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,500
We got 72 hours before the FBI and DEA
come and shut us down.

186
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,300
We'll be the bad guys.

187
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,100
The politics demand...

188
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,000
...that somebody take the rap,
and it'll be us.

189
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,900
Just do what you do.
Only faster.

190
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,200
Jojo, you still a chemist, right?

191
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,900
Cutting drugs and shit like that?

192
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,000
I don't know about that.
I'm out of the drug business.

193
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,900
You know something.

194
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,900
I just said "no" to drugs.

195
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,000
You said "no" to drugs!
What you into, Jo?

196
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,300
Rubber.

197
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,000
You're selling tires, huh?

198
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,300
You know nothing?
Jojo don't know nothing.

199
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,800
I know tires.

200
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,100
- You telling the truth?
- Would I lie to you?

201
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,200
Hey! You driving.

202
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,600
This is a waste of time.

203
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,700
In Maxie's line of work
she definitely gets the 411.

204
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,400
Maxie! How'd I know
I'd find you here?

205
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,700
We got to talk.
Where can we talk?

206
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,500
The equipment room?

207
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,900
- Behave yourself.
- I'm cool.

208
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,000
Listen, I need some help.
Again.

209
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,600
What else is new?

210
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,000
Some major ill shit
happened down at the P.D.

211
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,000
There's lots of heroin
and cash involved.

212
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,300
There'll be some jolly young men
who want to party.

213
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,000
What do you need?

214
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,500
Lots of people
will talk to you, not me.

215
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,500
You mean customers?

216
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,300
Don't get in any wild shit.
Just call if you hear something.

217
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,600
I think I will.

218
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,400
What are you doing?

219
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,400
Trying to keep my shit quick.

220
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,900
Right, you ain't getting none at home.
You got extra energy.

221
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,400
We got anything?

222
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,000
Sanchez says the air conditioning
contract went to...

223
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,100
...Manuel Arrona of Key Biscayne.

224
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,200
He works out of his house this week.
That's the number.

225
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,800
He's not answering.

226
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,500
I guess we should leave.

227
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,200
Make a trip all the way here
to high society for nothing?

228
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,700
No, man.
We can peek in the windows.

229
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,200
That's okay.

230
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,400
- I tripped.
- The handle just opened?

231
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,900
Right after I tripped.
They must want us to come in.

232
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,500
Take a peek.

233
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,400
Hello!

234
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,700
We're your new neighbors.

235
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,600
Don't be alarmed.
We're Negroes.

236
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,500
No man!
Too much bass in your voice.

237
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,100
That scares white folks.
Sound like them.

238
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,900
We were wondering if we can
borrow some brown sugar.

239
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,400
You fart?

240
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,400
No, man!

241
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,800
Dead guy.

242
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,800
Looks like somebody's home.

243
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,900
Let me take a stab at this one.

244
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,800
He sells the ventilation plans
to the bad guys.

245
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,200
- He gets rich, but dead.
- You're right on that.

246
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,400
- I'm going to go call homicide.
- Wait!

247
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Why do you act like this
around corpses?

248
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,200
It's cool. I just--

249
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,500
Please? Look around.

250
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,800
The smell and the--

251
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,400
It's just unexpected.

252
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,800
It's looks like our buddy Arrona
was a gambler.

253
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,800
Got dog track, jai alai...

254
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,200
- Needed money to pay his debts.
- Bookie.

255
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,400
Damn, man!

256
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,400
Watch where you swing
the dead leg!

257
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,000
My bad, my bad!

258
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,700
Damn this.
I'm calling homicide.

259
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,700
I'm a narcotics cop.

260
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,800
Dead bodies...

261
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,400
...dead ends.

262
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,700
Maggots.

263
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,600
What's wrong?

264
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Want to grab some burritos?

265
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,700
You drive slow enough
to drive Miss Daisy.

266
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,800
Man, the transaction is done.

267
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,200
We ain't got shit. It's over.

268
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,900
We got it before, we'll get it again.

269
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,500
Got it all figured out, don't you?

270
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,400
You got to have faith.

271
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,000
By the time we figured out how,
we'd be out of a job.

272
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,500
Scratch that! Everybody in
the unit will be out of a job!

273
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,400
But don't worry!

274
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,600
They tend to think
Mike Lowrey going to be all right.

275
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,900
Especially since they think
you some rich kid playing cop.

276
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,300
Look, man, I ain't got no trust fund.

277
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,800
See, for me, no job, no check.

278
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,500
That's like all the other guys
in the unit.

279
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,000
At least, most of us.

280
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
So I'm playing cop now?

281
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,700
This is a game?
I'm just joking?

282
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,700
You always wanting to be
Starsky or Hutch.

283
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,300
You know what?

284
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm so sick of this bullshit!

285
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,700
I'm supposed to apologize
for my family leaving me money?!

286
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,400
All I ever wanted to be was a cop!

287
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,000
I take it to the max every day.

288
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,300
I'm the first guy in and the last
to leave a crime scene.

289
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,800
So fuck you! And fuck them!

290
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,300
And fuck anybody who got
a problem with Mike Lowrey!

291
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,900
- I love you, man.
- Fuck you, Marcus.

292
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,100
I do.

293
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,800
You're cool, man.

294
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,400
- You're my partner.
- Shut up.

295
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,900
Slow-ass driver.

296
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,900
- Driving like a bitch.
- Why I got to be all that?

297
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,200
Slow-ass.

298
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,600
I'll take us off this cliff,
keep fucking with me.

299
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,000
Then it would be, what,
two bitches in the sea?

300
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,600
- Is that what you want?
- Shut up.

301
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,200
My wife know I ain't no bitch.

302
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,300
I'm a bad boy.

303
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,200
<i>Bad boys, bad boys</i>
<i>What you going to do?</i>

304
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,100
<i>What you going to do</i>
<i>When they come for you?</i>

305
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,300
Only models and that's all.

306
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,400
Max just dropped by.
I got to go.

307
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,000
You want me to call around
looking for the newly rich?

308
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,100
Are there any new guys partying a lot,
spending lots of money?

309
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,500
This guy called me today, desperate...

310
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,100
...looking for new girls in town.
Are you available?

311
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,000
It'll be a quick $2,000.

312
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,400
I got plans with Julie.

313
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,600
She's your roommate, right?

314
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,000
Bring her.
She's cute, she's sexy.

315
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,900
She's not a working girl.

316
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,800
He's on speedballs.

317
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,200
He probably can't get it up.

318
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,300
Maybe we'll go check it out.

319
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,800
Could be the party I'm looking for.

320
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,400
A party at the Biltmore.
That'll really rock.

321
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,100
I owe you one.

322
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,200
I'll just deduct it from
the hundreds of favors I owe you.

323
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,900
Am I becoming a guest who won't leave?

324
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,400
No, I like having you live with me.

325
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,700
I'm an out-of-work photographer
who can't cook.

326
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,300
Not a big upside for you there.

327
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,500
What hip individual inspired
this visit to the Biltmore?

328
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,900
It's a favor for Mike Lowrey.

329
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,900
The cop I think you're
a little bit in love with.

330
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,600
Maybe I am.
But we're just friends.

331
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,000
If I were in trouble,
he's the person I'd call.

332
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,200
I know, I know.
I've heard this before.

333
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,800
You must be Max. Welcome.

334
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,600
I'm Eddie.

335
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,100
To the AI Capone suite.

336
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,200
I guess we're a little early.

337
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,700
This is Julie.

338
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,000
You like AI Capone, don't you?

339
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,900
I hadn't thought about it.

340
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,300
I'm not kidding
about this being Capone's.

341
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,500
He had the place
rigged with secret passageways.

342
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,600
10 minutes, we're gone.

343
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,000
Five.

344
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,300
- One drink.
- One sip.

345
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,800
Just girl chat.

346
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,700
Where's the bathroom?

347
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,200
Upstairs on your right.

348
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,900
Watch your step.

349
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,700
Come.

350
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,600
Sit.

351
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,500
Enjoy yourself. Relax.

352
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,400
Eddie's got some favors
to play with.

353
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,700
That he does.

354
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,600
I should've told you about his party.

355
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,900
Well, now it's a surprise party.

356
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Okay, Max, I think we've been here
about 5 minutes too long.

357
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,300
I see you treat yourself well, Eddie.

358
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,400
I needed to blow off
a little steam after...

359
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,600
...the move, you know.

360
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,600
So a little party with
a few friends, that's all.

361
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,700
I was going to invite you guys.

362
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,300
Invite?

363
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,700
Looks like I'm catering this.

364
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,100
I was looking for my 2 keys of dope.
Now I know where they are.

365
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,600
Yours? It's our score.

366
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,200
- And the girl?
- Nobody.

367
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,500
Just entertainment.

368
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I'm Max.

369
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,800
Nice to meet you.

370
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,900
I like a woman who
takes pride in her appearance.

371
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,400
Don't you?

372
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,200
I hate when
a bitch lets herself slide.

373
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,100
You look like a model in that dress.

374
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,700
Will you model for me?

375
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,900
Oh, great!
It's the goon squad.

376
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,000
You were a cop.
You should know hookers talk.

377
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,200
You couldn't wait 4 more days
until I made the deal?

378
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,900
I can't work with
that kind of stupidity.

379
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,500
I got you connected inside.

380
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,100
I brought you my family.

381
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,600
It's my family now.

382
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,500
We're still friends.

383
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,700
- What're you guys doing?
- You pissed him off.

384
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,600
You got blood on me again.

385
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,000
Someone's there!

386
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
Get her!

387
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,000
Get her!

388
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,700
What the fuck?!

389
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,400
Shoot her!

390
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,400
- I got her.
- I got her!

391
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,100
- Bullshit!
- What do you know about shooting?

392
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,100
I can't believe she made it!

393
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,200
Are you serious?

394
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,600
She jumped.

395
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,100
Fuck!

396
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,600
Find out who she worked for,
and find out where she lives.

397
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,600
It's about fucking time!

398
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,800
Come here, look at this.
See this guy?

399
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,500
He's dead, right?

400
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,900
- Look familiar?
- Eddie Dominguez.

401
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,100
- The ex-cop.
- Two points for you.

402
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,600
And there's high-grade
heroin over there.

403
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,500
That's a headline Sinclair will love.

404
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,600
No sign of forced entry.

405
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,100
What is this? Looks like Beirut.

406
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,000
It's the AI Capone suite.

407
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,300
What can I say? Shit happens.

408
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,800
It's a shitty day.

409
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,200
Real shitty day.

410
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,600
We've got two shades
of lipstick over here.

411
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,600
Someone's missing from the party.

412
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,400
Listen to me.

413
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,300
Your only function in life now
is to find that person.

414
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,700
It's the only lead we have.

415
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,500
I'll check all calls to the room.

416
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,500
What you got over there?

417
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,100
Cover her.

418
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,300
He knew the girl?

419
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,100
We'll get the witness
and get the fools who did this.

420
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,300
See if you can
catch a ride with Howard.

421
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
Where you going?

422
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,300
Checking calls made to Lois Fields.
Maxie worked for her.

423
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,700
- I'll come with you.
- No, we'll catch up later.

424
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,700
You okay?

425
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,100
I'm cool.

426
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,500
Hello?

427
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,200
Shit!

428
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,800
Look, baby, I know
quality time was my idea.

429
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,800
<i>Don't talk about it.</i>

430
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,200
Hold on, babe.

431
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,900
I need a full file on Eddie Dominguez.

432
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,200
<i>Just a minute.</i>

433
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,300
<i>I got on the red one.</i>

434
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,000
The red one? With the snaps?
Couldn't you wait?

435
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,600
<i>You're never home.</i>

436
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,800
<i>All his files are blocked.</i>

437
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,300
I don't care about his personal files.
He's dead. Unblock it.

438
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,100
<i>Screw you, that's illegal.</i>

439
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,800
No, screw you!

440
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,500
<i>Are you talking to me?</i>

441
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,400
No, it's a term you use.
"Screw you" is a cop term.

442
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,400
<i>You ain't screwing nothing!</i>

443
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,300
Goddamn it!

444
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,200
Where's Lowrey?

445
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,600
I just paged him.

446
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,200
He's following up
this Lois Fields lead.

447
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,500
The madam?

448
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,900
Requesting backup.
614 Reach Road.

449
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
That might be him.

450
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,900
Lowrey's desk.

451
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,900
I need to talk
to Detective Mike Lowrey.

452
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,800
<i>Can I help you?</i>

453
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,500
You can get me Detective Lowrey.

454
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,700
Is this another paternity case?

455
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,800
No, it's another murder case,
you twerp!

456
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,700
You mean the murder case
at the Biltmore tonight?

457
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,900
<i>I've just seen my best friend murdered.</i>

458
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,200
I'll only talk to Mike Lowrey.

459
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Why only Mike Lowrey?

460
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,900
None of your business.
I talk to Lowrey or I blow town.

461
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,100
Mike, phone! Telephone!

462
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,700
He's coming right now.
Hold on.

463
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,800
Talk.

464
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,100
I ain't got time.

465
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,800
This is the witness from the hotel.

466
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,400
He just got out of the john.
Hold on.

467
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,500
- Talk to her now or she'll walk.
- I can't be Mike.

468
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,200
She's going to walk out.

469
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,500
- This is our witness.
- Calm down!

470
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,100
Hello.

471
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
This is Lowrey.

472
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,300
He doesn't talk that way.
Talk like him.

473
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
You don't sound sexy enough.

474
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,200
Damn!

475
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,800
You don't know me.
My name's Julie Mott.

476
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,300
I was Max Logan's best friend.

477
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,400
Calm down, calm down.

478
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,300
Talk to me now.

479
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,900
She said if she ever needed anything...

480
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,900
I need your help.

481
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,600
Give me the address.

482
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,300
All right.

483
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,000
It'll be okay.
Mike's to the rescue.

484
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,800
I'm on the way.

485
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,700
- I'll find Lowrey.
- I can't go.

486
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,200
You got to go!

487
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,700
Get Mike to handle this.

488
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,100
Get to this address now.
Get up!

489
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,300
You won't see your wife for a month!
Get up!

490
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,200
Get this fucking door fixed!

491
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,400
Mike Lowrey.

492
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,400
No, easy.
Mike Lowrey.

493
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Shit!

494
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
Who's there?

495
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,400
Mike Lowrey.

496
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,500
How do I know it's Lowrey?

497
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,000
'Cause, I'm Mike Lowrey!

498
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,100
We ain't got much time.

499
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,600
Hold your badge up to the peephole.

500
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,400
I won't let you in until you do.

501
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,100
No way!

502
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,400
- What was that for?
- You're not him!

503
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,200
What do you mean?!
You've never met him!

504
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,700
Max described you differently!

505
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,800
I'm undercover!

506
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,200
Prove it!

507
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,400
I know Max from way back.
I helped her brother get out of jail.

508
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,700
So?

509
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,200
Sometimes we got together
to bump and grind...

510
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,700
Wrong!

511
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,700
Give me the bat!

512
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,400
Fine!
You don't want to believe me?

513
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,600
You go at this shit alone!

514
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,100
I forgot.

515
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,600
The bad guys probably
know where you live...

516
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,400
...and are coming for you.
Good luck!

517
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,500
I saw the whole thing.

518
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,100
I watched him shoot her
like she was nothing.

519
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,200
Shut the door.

520
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,000
Look, lady.

521
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,300
You ain't got
no more bats, golf clubs...

522
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,600
...or anything like that
to swing at me, do you?

523
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,600
I knew Max, okay?

524
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,900
I cared about Max also.

525
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,900
I'm just here to help you.

526
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,100
You're not what I expected.

527
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,700
I ain't expect to walk
into Yankee Stadium either.

528
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,700
We got to get out of here, okay?
Let's go.

529
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,200
I've got to get my dogs.
Dukie!

530
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,200
Lukie, Dukie, whatever!

531
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,500
You got a back door?

532
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,400
Where we going?

533
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,800
Protective custody.

534
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,700
Fuck that!
I'm only dealing with you.

535
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,600
A cop threw that party at the hotel.

536
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,600
Former cop.
We got rid of him long ago.

537
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,900
Come on, Luke!

538
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,200
Listen, if you want to live,
you got to trust me.

539
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,600
Here, doggie!
Come on, doggie!

540
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,800
Who the hell was that?!

541
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,600
There is too much killing going on!

542
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,200
Go after them!

543
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,600
I'll go around front!

544
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,900
Come on, move your ass!

545
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,200
Get in the car!

546
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,900
- Go, goddamn it!
- Fucking door!

547
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,800
Go, goddamn it, go!

548
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,800
How did you miss them?
You fat fuck!

549
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,500
Watch your fucking mouth!

550
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,400
Lose weight, you'd have caught them.

551
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,300
I'd like to squeeze your fucking head.

552
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,400
Now you're fucking in trouble!

553
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,800
- You get the license plate?
- I got the plates.

554
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,500
You cockeyed fuck!

555
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,500
This is a getaway car?
We won't get away from anything!

556
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,000
Is this a family station wagon?

557
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,300
You got a baby seat in the back!

558
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,000
It's an undercover car, okay?

559
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,000
I know they saw my license plate.

560
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,300
Were those the guys who shot Max?

561
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,200
I only saw bullets.
You tell me what they look like.

562
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,100
I was busy trying
to keep a bullet out of you.

563
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,800
I need you to look
through some mug shots...

564
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,900
...to identify Max's shooter.

565
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,900
- Where?
- Protective custody.

566
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,100
I told you I'm not going
into protective custody!

567
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,500
I'm not playing.

568
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,200
You really pissing me off.
I'll book your ass!

569
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:42,000
I'll develop amnesia. I suddenly
feel a case of it coming on.

570
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,900
Fine, where would you feel safe?

571
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,300
You want to do protective custody?

572
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:52,100
In-home protective custody,
at your place. I can handle that.

573
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,800
Yeah, my place.
My place is--

574
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,400
No way!

575
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,200
Right!

576
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,300
Yeah, my place is the shit.

577
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,400
Mike Lowrey's place.
You right.

578
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,000
That's the best idea
you came up with tonight.

579
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,700
Wait here.

580
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,500
Wait here.

581
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,300
Detective Burnett!

582
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,800
How are you?
Mr. Lowrey's not here.

583
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,200
He said I could use his place.

584
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,400
He didn't mention it to me.

585
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,800
Who's the chick?
How's your wife?

586
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,100
Fine, she's fine.

587
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,300
Your kids, they're good?
Family's the most important thing.

588
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,900
Is it?

589
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,500
Mr. Lowrey said you got a baby factory
going on at your house.

590
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,000
Here you go.

591
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,400
If that ain't enough,
I'll run you in for extortion.

592
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,700
You know,
I'm so stupid sometimes.

593
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,200
Now that you mention it,
Mr. Lowrey mentioned you'd come by.

594
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,100
Did he say he had a key?

595
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,600
Hang out.

596
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,200
- Here.
- Is this it?

597
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,400
You're hurting me.

598
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,800
- Thank you. Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

599
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,600
Have fun.

600
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,400
It's not like that.

601
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,300
It's not like that.

602
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,400
Come on.

603
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,900
Watch your step up through here.

604
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,600
I must've left some incense burning.

605
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,500
Welcome to <i>Casa de</i> Lowrey.

606
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,800
This is kind of...

607
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,100
I'm always moving my switches.

608
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,200
I'm always decorating, so sometimes
I just don't know where shit is.

609
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,200
Shit!

610
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,700
Why am I tripping on shit
I know is there?

611
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,900
You found a light switch.

612
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,300
I should have known it was there
since I decorated the place.

613
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,300
<i>This is Yvette.</i>

614
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,800
Ignore this.
It's one of my freaks, Yvette.

615
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,100
She's always calling,
got to have it.

616
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,000
Don't call here no more now, freak!
Just one of my freaks.

617
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,700
All this on a cop's salary?

618
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,900
Well...

619
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,500
...it's honest money.

620
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,200
I'm a second-generation rich kid.

621
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,100
If you're not in it for the paycheck,
are you an action junkie?

622
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,300
If that what you want to call it.

623
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,500
I don't mind bats swung at my head,
bullets grazing my ass.

624
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,400
Gives me a rush.

625
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,800
Look...

626
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,200
...I'll give you a broad stroke
of the place.

627
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,800
I got some T-bones in the fridge
for Lukie and Dukie...

628
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Sorry, the fridge is this way.
I confuse my own shit.

629
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,300
Wait, are you going to
leave me here alone?

630
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,000
I must go to the P.D.

631
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,500
These are Miami's
peak crime hours, you know.

632
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,000
Apparently.

633
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,700
They said this deal was going down
in 4 days, and I, you know...

634
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,500
...obviously seem to be kind of
a major glitch in their--

635
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,700
You ain't with the bad guys now.
You're with the cops.

636
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,300
With Mike Lowrey. You with the cops.

637
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,000
Everything will be all right.
Trust me.

638
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,200
I'll be back.

639
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,800
I know that it's no time to joke,
but remember in the movie when...?

640
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,200
All right, all right.

641
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,300
Thanks for everything, Mike.

642
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,300
I'm going.

643
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,400
You're one of those in and out guys.

644
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,800
It's not like that, Chet.

645
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,400
- She's a witness.
- Right.

646
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,400
- Keep an eye out.
- No problem.

647
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,300
Listen to me. Hear me.

648
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,000
- Me?
- That's right.

649
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:50,800
All right, the moment Lowrey gets in,
you have him call me at home.

650
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,800
- At my home.
- Call you at home.

651
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,800
Don't let him go upstairs.

652
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,000
What? But he lives here.

653
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,300
I could lose my job.

654
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,500
Chet, trust me on this, okay?

655
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,900
Call you from here.

656
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,600
Don't let him up.

657
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,300
- No problem.
- Important witness.

658
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,600
Thank you.

659
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,400
I got an idea. I'm off in 2 hours,
I could go upstairs...

660
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,800
...and watch the door.

661
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Like cops do in the movies.

662
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,800
I got a magazine and everything.
And I don't let anybody in or out.

663
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,900
All kidding aside, I want to help.

664
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,700
You're helping.
Do that from here. Can you?

665
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,000
Yes, I can.

666
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,100
Fine.
That helps. From here, okay?

667
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,800
It's funny that you ask me,
because I was going to be a cop.

668
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,500
I took the test and everything.
Just didn't work out.

669
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,800
Politics.

670
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,300
I know, you're my deputy.

671
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,700
- I am.
- From here.

672
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:43,900
Watch out.

673
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,400
Right.

674
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,500
Take care, chief.

675
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,200
I'm a deputy.

676
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,600
Don't "honey-baby" me,
you smell like perfume.

677
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,900
And you don't have
your wedding ring on!

678
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,100
Damn!

679
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,500
I went undercover...

680
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,900
...and it required
taking off the ring.

681
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,900
I got the ring. I put my hand
in my pocket to get it...

682
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,700
...and it's right back on.

683
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,800
Damn!

684
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,200
Can I get a pillow?

685
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,300
If it isn't the guy
who doesn't return phone calls.

686
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,100
Where you been
the last 12 hours?

687
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,800
I paged you all night!

688
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,800
We got a situation here
that you need to know about.

689
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,300
Look, Marcus...

690
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,300
...I got a dead madam, a concussion
and a bad headache.

691
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,100
Let me tell you what I did last night.

692
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,700
I had to sleep on my couch.
I woke up with a Power Ranger in my ass.

693
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,700
While we're discussing my ass,
I damn near got it blown off.

694
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,700
The good news is I got a witness.

695
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,800
Let me tell you about her.
She likes to--

696
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,000
You sound like a nagging wife.

697
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,800
I'm a nagging...?

698
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,600
See what happens when you go off alone?
You get into shit.

699
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,800
Like shit don't happen
when you're there.

700
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,400
That ain't the point.

701
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,800
If your partner pages you,
you should call him back.

702
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,500
I want to meet the man
who whupped your ass.

703
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,700
I want to meet
who whupped Shaft's ass.

704
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,400
Look at me. You don't know
what I've been through.

705
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,000
My wife kicked me out
of my happy home.

706
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,600
But, no.
You got to go off by yourself.

707
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:32,000
"I got this, partner, I got this."
Bullshit.

708
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,500
I'm feeling much better,
thanks.

709
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,900
I'll get him.

710
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:38,700
I'll beat you up.

711
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,400
Did you hear what I said?!

712
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,300
I did, because I was there
when I said it.

713
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,600
I told you.
I told you to secure a witness...

714
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,600
...not shoot up a neighborhood.

715
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:57,100
Not to do another dead body.
Just get the dope back, quietly.

716
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,200
This whole situation
is getting out of control.

717
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,700
You're damn right it is!

718
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,700
I had to pass a pop quiz
before she believed I was him.

719
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,400
Going, it's going...

720
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,500
Shit, little off.

721
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,900
I haven't killed anyone today.

722
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,000
Do you want me to yell at you?

723
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,000
Listen, this witness...

724
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,200
...it's the only good news I got,
okay?

725
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,100
You guys are bad news.

726
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,500
What does that mean?
It means if you must be Mike Lowrey...

727
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,100
...I don't give a shit,
that's who you'll be!

728
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,900
Wait a minute,
what the hell is going on?

729
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,800
I was getting them all in
before you came.

730
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,100
Can somebody talk to me, please?
What's going on?

731
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,900
These fools could have seen
my license plate.

732
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,200
Where is she?

733
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,000
His place.

734
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,100
What?

735
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,000
You left her alone?

736
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,900
Our only witness?!

737
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,200
You left a hooker in my apartment?!

738
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,900
The girl is not a hooker,
as far as I know.

739
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:08,200
I had to stash her somewhere.
Her and her dogs, Luke and Dukie.

740
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,400
You left dogs in my house?
There's dogs and a hooker in my house?

741
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,100
Add some chimps, we'll have a carnival.

742
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,800
- She's not a hooker.
- Respect my stuff.

743
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,000
- Can you please--
- Shut up!

744
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,000
For years, Sinclair has tried
to pin something on me.

745
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,800
I'm always taking it for you.
Do it for me!

746
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,900
If this witness IDs the shooters,
maybe we catch our bad guys.

747
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,000
But until then...

748
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,500
...until then...

749
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,000
...you are Mike Lowrey.

750
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,300
You be him,
that's what you are.

751
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,500
You're him!
I don't want to hear it!

752
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,200
You be you.

753
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,700
But not in front of her!
You're him, you're you!

754
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,700
Can we get a time-out?
Am I the designated homeless?

755
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:03,600
Does it look like I care?
Whatever it takes, all right?

756
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,700
What did she say to you?

757
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,500
The shooters will make their drop
in 4 days? So we got 4 days.

758
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,200
What kind of plan is that?

759
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,400
I can't be shacked up with her.

760
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,000
I have a family to look after.
My wife will kill my ass.

761
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,400
You don't like your job, quit!

762
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,700
Damn!

763
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,100
I'll stay at the house
with Theresa and the kids.

764
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,900
Thanks, but no thanks.
You won't last 5 minutes with my family.

765
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,100
Married life is easy.
You only got one woman to satisfy.

766
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,600
Yo, man...

767
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,200
...we ain't the Cosbys.

768
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,900
Let's go, I got this.

769
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,100
Go.

770
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,100
Everybody wants to be like Mike.

771
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,200
You're going to be retired
like him too.

772
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,000
I'd have dunked it on your ass.

773
00:50:58,900 --> 00:50:59,800
Cleveland?

774
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,800
I never-- Look, woman,
I done told you...

775
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,800
...it's a federal subpoena.

776
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,200
Am I going to tell them no?

777
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,000
I don't know. Why can't he go?

778
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,500
Why can't you go?

779
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,600
I wanted to, but Captain Howard said
I'm irresponsi--

780
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:20,600
No, he said, "loose cannon."
Because I be shooting in public.

781
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,100
Out of nowhere sometimes.

782
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,800
No, man.

783
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,700
Please. All right.

784
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,600
Look. The neighborhood
has lots of break-ins.

785
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,600
I can handle it.

786
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,000
I know, but I'm worrying about me.
Mike's going to stay here.

787
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,600
Take care of y'all.
Just till I come back.

788
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,400
Who'll pick up the kids from day care?
Mike can't do it.

789
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,100
Are you listening to me?

790
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,500
I read a book
that could probably help y'all.

791
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,000
Can you go down and have a Coke?

792
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,500
Please!

793
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,700
All right.

794
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,200
Want something?

795
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,100
Bring me a Coke.

796
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:03,200
Want one?

797
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,600
I'm fine, thanks.

798
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,000
All right.

799
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,400
Explain it to me. There's a problem
with our chemistry set?

800
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,000
It's not a chemistry set.

801
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,100
He knows it ain't a chemistry set.

802
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,200
So what is it?

803
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,200
The cutting agent
is a highly volatile...

804
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,800
...substance.

805
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,500
- I don't care.
- The ether--

806
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,500
I don't care! I don't care!

807
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,000
I'm not
a fucking chemistry teacher.

808
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,300
What is the problem?!

809
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,400
There's too much moisture down here.

810
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,500
It's totally fucked.

811
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,800
Shut up!

812
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:49,900
Okay.

813
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,200
What else?

814
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:55,500
It's taking longer to cook
than we planned. If we rush it...

815
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,300
...we can't sell the drugs.

816
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,600
You're fucking with my timetable.
I gave you a deadline.

817
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,800
Understand?

818
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,700
- Do you understand?!
- I do.

819
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,200
You dressed?

820
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,600
Yeah, I am.

821
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:23,500
We must go through some mug shots.
I'll hook into the computer.

822
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,900
- And we can do this.
- Who's that guy in the photos?

823
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:34,100
Sometimes I don't look
and forget all those pictures was here.

824
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:38,200
That's my partner. That's my partner,
Marcus Burnett.

825
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,700
I've never seen anything
like this before.

826
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,700
I see how it may throw you
a little bit.

827
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,400
It's a cop thing.

828
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,600
These pictures are here for
each time he saved my life.

829
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:54,300
It's the same with him.
At his place, just pictures of me.

830
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,000
It's like a shrine. Just a reminder.

831
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:03,400
When I saw it, the whole wall,
I thought maybe they were...

832
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,200
...pictures of your lover.

833
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,100
Who?

834
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,000
I thought you were gay.

835
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,400
Gay?

836
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,200
Nah, nah, nah.

837
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,800
I didn't mean to offend you.
It's okay to be a homosexual.

838
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,800
You're not listening.
It's not registering.

839
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:27,300
Believe me. Did you sleep in the bed?
You didn't feel the dents?

840
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,200
The dents come from that.

841
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,800
That's how I gets down.

842
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,300
That's...

843
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,500
...sweet.

844
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I'm gay. If I was, I'd change the drapes
in this motherfucker.

845
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
No.

846
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,300
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

847
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,400
I don't eat flesh.

848
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,100
What?

849
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,600
That's flesh that you're...

850
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,400
...shoveling in your mouth.

851
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:01,400
That was a living, breathing creature.
It probably had a name.

852
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,200
It's just bologna.

853
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,500
My bologna has a first name.

854
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,700
Actually, your bologna has
about 30 names...

855
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:14,500
...because they take odd parts
from all different ones.

856
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:18,700
The leftovers: the hooves,
stomach lining, ears...

857
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:23,900
...and stuff. They put it into
a machine and grind it up.

858
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,800
Then out comes, like, this sheet.
That's what you're eating now.

859
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,300
You know what?

860
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,600
I don't eat bologna no more.
How about a pickle?

861
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,300
- Can I eat the pickle?
- It has salt, but it's a vegetable.

862
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,800
Salt in the pickle?

863
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:48,800
Let me rinse-- Let me rinse it off.
There we go.

864
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,500
How's that?

865
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,000
Just... Let's keep going.

866
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,700
I don't taste salt now.

867
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,900
Go back.

868
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,800
That's the guy.

869
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,100
He was there, in the room.

870
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,700
We got a tip they was running
major druggage, like 50 keys.

871
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,700
So we steps to the door.

872
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,700
"Freeze! Miami P.D.!
Get down, get down, get down!"

873
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:26,700
Out of nowhere, this pimp named Chino
punched me in the head.

874
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:29,600
Chino's running ho's.
Your dad will explain that.

875
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,700
Look at it.

876
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,200
Your dogs shit all over my place.
Liquid shit.

877
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:39,400
It doesn't help, shellacking it in
with furniture polish.

878
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,700
There's a piece there.
Get it.

879
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,300
- I got it.
- Look like a chip of shit.

880
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:49,600
Can I please have the parole jacket
on Noah Trafficante?

881
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,600
- Thank you.
- You know what?

882
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,600
I'm tired of this witness.

883
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,600
I want my life the way it was.

884
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,000
I'm tired.
I got married so I could stop lying.

885
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,300
I can't believe you're complaining.

886
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:06,200
You've got it easy compared to me,
living in that zoo.

887
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,700
Why you call my place a zoo?!

888
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,400
- I'm tired of you.
- You want to fight?

889
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,900
Listen, Francine, please...

890
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,900
That's my silk shirt, man!

891
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,200
It's nice.

892
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:25,300
I figure since I'm gonna be Mike,
I might as well dress like Mike.

893
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,000
<i>I want to be...</i>

894
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,700
<i>...I want to be like Mike.</i>

895
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,600
You're sick.
Something's wrong with you.

896
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,800
You have a problem
that should be checked.

897
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,100
Probably.

898
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,100
- The file. He worked at Club Hell.
- Thank you.

899
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,800
Can you take care of this?
I gotta call the wife.

900
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,800
Whose wife?!

901
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,900
Can you please do some work?

902
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,600
- Once today, just do something!
- I tell you--

903
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,600
Do something to help this case.

904
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:55,900
Boy!

905
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,100
You look handsome today.

906
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:02,700
No, see, it's not that kind of day.
Leave me alone.

907
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,000
Seriously.

908
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:06,000
What's up, babe, PMS?

909
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,600
Damn the jokes!

910
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,000
- Damn them! Ring it.
- Okay, I won't say anything.

911
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,800
That's cool. Hold on.

912
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:16,800
Go ahead.

913
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,100
All right.

914
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,100
How are the kids?

915
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,700
How's potty training going?

916
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,200
You're so silly.

917
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,400
<i>Will you be late?</i>

918
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:35,700
No, it'll be 10:30, 11:00
before I get in.

919
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,000
Don't wait up. I'll be there.

920
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,100
Rent a movie.

921
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,700
Something we can kick back to.

922
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,300
What're you wearing?

923
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,900
Give me the phone! Give it!

924
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:58,400
She hung up a long time ago.
I was playing. I was playing.

925
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,200
I was playing.

926
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,300
Don't play like that.
That's my family. My happy home.

927
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,000
Stop wearing my clothes.

928
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,700
Everybody about the
motherfucking jokes today!

929
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,700
I can't believe this.

930
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,300
Come on, Eddie Dominguez's file
can't be that hard to get into.

931
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:25,800
I tried 3 times, I just can't get in.
Besides, this is illegal.

932
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:30,700
That never stopped you before.
Just let me know if you get anything.

933
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,400
Anything for you.
But I can't get in. I tried.

934
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,900
- What's up, Chet?
- Hey, Mr. Lowrey.

935
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,000
Hey, Mr. Lowrey.

936
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,000
The Lowrey Brothers.

937
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,100
Let's just get down to Club Hell
and pick up Noah.

938
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,500
Julie, it's me!

939
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,300
You're supposed to get us
the Dominguez file.

940
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,700
It'll take a day or two.

941
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,400
- We don't have a day or two.
- I'm not a computer whiz.

942
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,400
It'll take awhile.

943
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:18,100
- You ain't taking care of shit.
- I was thinking--

944
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,400
Hi.

945
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,000
- You must be Marcus.
- I'd be Marcus.

946
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,700
- That's right.
- Marcus, right?

947
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,600
I'm Julie.

948
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,400
Julie, hi.

949
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:31,900
Nice to meet you.

950
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,600
You too.
I recognized you from...

951
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,500
...every one of the photographs.

952
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:39,400
Well, it's my man, you know.

953
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,200
The wall.
Yeah, those on the wall.

954
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,700
You must be very good.

955
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,300
I'm sorry?

956
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,800
As a partner.
Given your job, what you do.

957
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,800
What time are we
doing this thing tonight?

958
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,500
Mike said we're going to a club.

959
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,500
"We"...

960
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,400
...as in me and my partner.

961
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,800
You wanted protective custody.
You at my house.

962
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,500
That's just great.

963
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:14,600
I'll stay here with Chet
the mini-moron doorman to protect me?

964
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,400
Chet is very good.

965
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:21,300
That looks like a stain on your rug.
Damn.

966
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:25,700
That was my baby, Luke.
He gets nervous and--

967
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,300
He just shits.

968
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:31,600
It's like marking his territory.
Sort of a male thing.

969
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:35,000
I offered to pay Mike for the cleaning
and he refused.

970
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,400
I'll get rid of it.

971
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,800
You don't need that.

972
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I was going to throw it out.
I want a new look.

973
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,000
Mike, he's a special guy.
Mike is special.

974
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,400
I call him Special Mike.

975
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:50,400
It's funny, you can laugh at that.
That's why...

976
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,200
...I love him.

977
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,400
Me, I'd be pissed.

978
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,600
Look at this cute dog on the couch.

979
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,700
That's Luke.

980
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,400
Look how he crawls on the leather.

981
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:07,000
You want to meet Duke?
He's in the bed. He's upset...

982
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:10,700
...and having diarrhea and throwing up.

983
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,400
Oh, baby.

984
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,700
Let's go see
if Duke is going to be okay.

985
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,900
Me and you. Me and you.

986
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,800
Who are you?

987
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,700
- Who are you?
- Look, you must get out.

988
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,200
- Hands off!
- Don't push me!

989
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,500
I'm Yvette.

990
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:37,200
Get your hands off me!

991
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,100
What're you doing?

992
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:43,400
Get out. If you don't stop
stalking me, I'll arrest you.

993
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,700
You old psycho!

994
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,400
- You asshole!
- She's into some weird shit.

995
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,000
What's going on?

996
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,700
That was crazy Yvette.

997
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,600
Stalking me.

998
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:01,300
I forgot she was coming.
You threw her out?

999
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,000
Yvette is a masseuse.

1000
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,000
She massages shit.

1001
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,400
She told me.

1002
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,400
Are there any other
totally hysterical...

1003
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:24,400
...half-naked women popping by
I should know about?

1004
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:25,900
She was naked?

1005
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,600
Titties were out.

1006
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,100
You threw her out naked?

1007
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,500
My wife would hate--
She hates womanizers.

1008
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,200
Something's wrong with you.

1009
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,100
You don't respect
other people's shit.

1010
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,700
I've been telling you that for years.

1011
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,400
Your trash is all over.

1012
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,300
Enough! Please!

1013
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,900
Me and my partner...

1014
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:55,200
...we're going to Club Hell
to bust Noah.

1015
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,500
Anyone have a problem with that?

1016
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Fine.

1017
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,700
Don't blow the case.

1018
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,600
Here's the deal: You stay put.

1019
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:19,000
Anyone tells you to move,
you're making a delivery for Fouchet.

1020
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,100
You got it? You got it? Frank?

1021
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:25,500
It's ether! It'll explode, you dope!

1022
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,300
Don't even breathe, you knucklehead!

1023
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:45,600
I remember you.

1024
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,200
Check it, Lowrey...

1025
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,400
...we got 2 days left.
Let's do this right.

1026
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,000
No gunshots, no dead bodies.

1027
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,100
I'm not trying to lose my job.

1028
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:17,600
As I recall, the last dead bad guys
belonged to you.

1029
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:20,100
Next time you kill them...

1030
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,400
...do it after you get the information.
Just a suggestion.

1031
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:28,300
Please. You ain't even
comparing body counts.

1032
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,300
Should I keep going?

1033
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,700
I'm out.

1034
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:36,100
Noah's parole jacket
says he works here.

1035
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,400
We're here arguing
like schoolgirls.

1036
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,700
Let's stop this bickering.

1037
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:45,400
Because you're getting on my nerves.

1038
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,700
He got no package.

1039
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,400
Look at you! Look at you!
Can you stay focused?

1040
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:14,800
I'm focused.

1041
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:18,000
Focused on all this ass around here.

1042
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,500
Let's do what we came to do and go.

1043
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,800
- Simple.
- Fine.

1044
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:24,800
Check around. Meet at the bar
in 10 minutes.

1045
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:26,900
- Fine.
- Fine.

1046
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:34,000
Holy shit, what is he doing?

1047
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,300
Oh, man!

1048
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,800
That's the cop! There he is!

1049
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:40,300
That's him! I'm going.

1050
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:50,800
What's up?

1051
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:56,100
Budweiser. Feel like I had
a million of them.

1052
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,900
What's up?

1053
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,400
Tell me where to throw him!

1054
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:03,600
Fuck!

1055
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:17,200
Learn how to work the safety
with your punk-ass.

1056
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:18,700
I'll be back.

1057
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,000
Who whupped your ass now?

1058
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,300
This really ain't the fucking time.

1059
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,000
They know.
Let's get Noah and go.

1060
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:51,800
It's the chick.

1061
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,400
Look, the chick!

1062
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,900
The bitch from the rooftop!

1063
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:39,500
Let's go!

1064
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:42,000
That was the guy who shot Max!

1065
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,200
The truck!

1066
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,600
Take the truck!

1067
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,000
There! Go!

1068
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:55,900
We're in a hurry.

1069
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:58,900
Let's go!

1070
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,600
You're cops! Why are we running away?!
He's in there!

1071
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,900
Here! Go!

1072
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:15,400
This is good.

1073
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,000
Noah's chasing us!

1074
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:19,100
What was that?

1075
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:21,300
What was that?

1076
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,800
That was-- I don't know.

1077
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:28,000
I had a perfect shot at him
if Action Jackson here--

1078
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:32,400
No! This is official police business!

1079
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:36,300
You had no business in there!
Can you drive?

1080
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,400
- Please drive!
- Don't bring it here!

1081
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,900
You picked an ice cream truck!

1082
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,800
- What am I smelling?
- Drive!

1083
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:47,300
What am I smelling?

1084
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,500
Ether.

1085
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,000
Extremely flammable ether.

1086
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:52,200
Oh, shit.

1087
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:53,700
Goddamn.

1088
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,300
You the man!

1089
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:56,800
You the man tonight!

1090
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,100
How you pick an ice-cream truck
that's a bomb?!

1091
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,300
Shit!

1092
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,400
This is protective custody?!

1093
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,700
Yes!

1094
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:17,700
Shit!

1095
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:35,900
Do something!
We're out of road!

1096
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:37,800
Who picked this road?!

1097
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,600
All the road in Miami
and you run out!

1098
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,700
Come up with an idea, fast!

1099
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,100
Why must I come up with the ideas?!

1100
01:11:58,100 --> 01:11:59,300
Take this shit!

1101
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,000
Dead end!
There's no more road!

1102
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,800
We out of fucking road!

1103
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:17,400
It's going to blow!

1104
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,100
Get the fuck out!

1105
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,800
Well...

1106
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,200
Should I add this to your body count?

1107
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,300
There goes our only lead to the dope.

1108
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,600
Ain't this a bitch!

1109
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,100
The dope?!

1110
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,800
What are you talking about?

1111
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,200
"There goes our only lead to Max's
killer?!" He's out there!

1112
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:02,600
That's not important, it's not
your job to protect people! Shit!

1113
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,200
- She's crazy!
- I'm crazy?!

1114
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,100
Her rocker's gone!

1115
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:14,200
Stop your barking!
This is the witness!

1116
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,000
She done zoomed.
You deal with her.

1117
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:18,800
No way.

1118
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,300
Listen, yes, okay, you're right.

1119
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:25,900
This started because of missing drugs.
But let me tell you:

1120
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:29,500
There's nothing more
important to Mike...

1121
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:32,100
...than doing this guy that killed Max.

1122
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:37,200
Sometimes he has a hard time
expressing his real feelings.

1123
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:42,200
Come on.
It'll be all right.

1124
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,000
We need you.

1125
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,200
Part of the team.

1126
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:50,200
I thought he was supposed to be
the smooth one.

1127
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,600
This has not been a good day.

1128
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:57,900
Damn right. It's bullshit.
We got 2 days to find these fools...

1129
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:01,300
...and no leads because
you cooked Noah's ass.

1130
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,300
Shampoo?

1131
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,700
Hello.

1132
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:14,300
What's up?

1133
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:21,700
It don't take that long
to get shampoo.

1134
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:23,900
- Let's go.
- Look at this.

1135
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,800
Animal tested. Animal tested.

1136
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,600
You know how many chemicals
are in this?

1137
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,800
I don't care if you go bald.
Let's go.

1138
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:32,900
Jojo.

1139
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,500
He's a chemist.

1140
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:39,000
Too much heroin and ether
for nobody to know nothing.

1141
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:40,800
What's he talking about?

1142
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:44,300
You know the barrels of ether that
blew up on the truck?

1143
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,500
It's used to process heroin.

1144
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:49,400
They do that to cut it.
It quadruples the value.

1145
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,200
You can't stick it in the microwave.

1146
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:54,400
Let's pay for this.

1147
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,400
How much?

1148
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,900
$14.25.

1149
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,400
I left my wallet somewhere.

1150
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,800
Freeze, motherbitches!

1151
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:08,700
- Don't move.
- Wait.

1152
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:10,100
I'm not understanding.

1153
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,100
Do you attract violence?

1154
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,300
Shut the fuck up!

1155
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,600
Take it easy.

1156
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,100
We are cops.

1157
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:21,500
You're not cops. I'm not stupid.
I know.

1158
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:23,400
- Wait.
- I've seen police.

1159
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:25,700
I'm reaching for my badge.

1160
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,300
You want badges, motherbitch?!

1161
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,000
I give you badges!

1162
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,700
Here! 99 cents.
I sell you some.

1163
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:35,700
You got 8 badges.
This cop thing don't work.

1164
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,400
I blow you!

1165
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:38,800
Then I blow you!

1166
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:41,800
Blow me? No, hump me,
that's all right.

1167
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:45,400
I kill before. I kill again.

1168
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,400
- Hold on!
- I'll blow you!

1169
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:48,900
- Hump me.
- Hold on!

1170
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:52,900
The emotion I'm going through
means this is serious.

1171
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:56,700
Me and this motherfucker
is not vibing right now.

1172
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:59,900
- Something on your chest?
- I got something.

1173
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:02,200
Hello! The guy's got a cannon.

1174
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,200
What do you want?

1175
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,700
You want some?
Then come get it.

1176
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:06,700
I'm gone!

1177
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:07,800
Freeze, bitch!

1178
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,700
You freeze, bitch!

1179
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:13,000
Oh, shit. I'm fucked.

1180
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:14,800
Now back up.

1181
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,300
Put the gun down.
Get me a pack of Bubblicious.

1182
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,600
And some Skittles.

1183
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:28,600
Hell of a night.
I'm going to bed.

1184
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:32,200
So make yourself at home.

1185
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,200
It's your bed.

1186
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,400
I'll sit down...

1187
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:38,200
...for a minute.

1188
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:42,800
Because I'm guarding shit.
I'm watching out for the bad boys.

1189
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I can see things real well, you know...

1190
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,900
...from my peripherals.

1191
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,200
For such a stud, Mike Lowrey...

1192
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:54,600
...you sure seem rigid about having
a girl in your bed.

1193
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:56,900
Who?

1194
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,600
Me? Mike Lowrey?
I'm not rigid.

1195
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,600
Comfortable.

1196
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:06,000
It's my bed.
Why would I be uncomfortable?

1197
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,800
I don't know. I think it's more
than just wired.

1198
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,700
Maybe it was all the guns and stuff.

1199
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,200
I never really shot a gun before.

1200
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,500
All that steel...

1201
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:21,700
Don't you feel a little funny?

1202
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,700
I'm not a comedian, but...

1203
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:28,700
I don't mean that kind of funny,
I mean, like...

1204
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,100
...funny.

1205
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,500
You don't want that.

1206
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:41,700
You don't want that,
because when I come...

1207
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,600
...I come with thunder.

1208
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,100
And that's...

1209
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:50,800
You sound like you're saving yourself
for marriage.

1210
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:55,000
No, that ain't me there.

1211
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,100
That's Marcus.

1212
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,400
You know what I'm saying?
He's the man.

1213
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:01,700
I got some others--

1214
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:05,300
I done seen it now.
Turn the page.

1215
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,200
Turn the page.
I done already seen it.

1216
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:10,700
Don't laugh.

1217
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,400
I cannot believe he wore
his Afro that big.

1218
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,500
- I forgot about that.
- He looked cute like that.

1219
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:20,200
What's Marcus' wife like?

1220
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,000
She's like a wife.

1221
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:31,200
I mean, she must be pretty amazing
to keep a guy like Marcus.

1222
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,600
Keep a guy like what?

1223
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,300
You know, watching him tonight,
he's very...

1224
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,200
...sort of take charge.

1225
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,800
The way he was throwing guys
this way and that.

1226
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:50,700
There's something about him.
I don't know what. He's so smooth.

1227
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Boy...

1228
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,800
...I bet...

1229
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:58,400
...his wife's enjoying the smoothness
right this minute.

1230
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,400
He got a quality that women respond to.

1231
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:08,500
I can't imagine the kind of woman
that wouldn't find Marcus...

1232
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,400
...attractive.

1233
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:13,400
Probably couldn't be around him...

1234
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:16,200
...just like our situation.

1235
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:20,000
- If two people were alone--
- Not with a guy like that.

1236
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,300
Excuse me.

1237
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,300
What is wrong with him?

1238
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:30,500
This one goes on
the bulletin board at work.

1239
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,900
Don't do that, no, come on.

1240
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:35,800
<i>Put it back in. I can't believe you</i>
<i>took it out.</i>

1241
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,800
Marcus'll kill us if he finds out.
Give it to me.

1242
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,100
<i>I can't believe I let you see it.</i>

1243
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:42,500
Motherfucker!

1244
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,100
Goddamn it.

1245
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:53,100
Got some jewelry for you.

1246
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,400
I'm sorry, but damn that.

1247
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:00,700
We need to address the serious
lack of trust in this relationship.

1248
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:01,700
Please.

1249
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:04,000
Is this legal?
I don't think it's legal.

1250
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,300
I won't be long.

1251
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,300
It's legal.

1252
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,900
Out of sight.

1253
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,700
Sanchez, Lowrey.
Yeah, your mother. Listen.

1254
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:16,100
These guys
are about to make a move.

1255
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:19,500
Blue convertible. Two occupants.
Check it out.

1256
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:26,900
Here we go.

1257
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:28,100
Is that our guy?

1258
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:29,500
Where's the girl?

1259
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,100
I don't see any girl.

1260
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:41,000
Fuck off, barking-ass dog.
Shut up!

1261
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:45,600
Sneak up on my own house.

1262
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:48,700
What in the world?

1263
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:49,900
Very strange.

1264
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:53,400
His ass is upstairs.
Supposed to be my boy!

1265
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,800
You motherfucker!

1266
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,200
Ducking and weaving,
up and down.

1267
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,800
Look at this shit.
This is what you want?

1268
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:02,500
Got me climbing like a fucking chimp.

1269
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,200
No, I ain't going out like that.

1270
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:08,100
Don't take nobody that long
to get in bed.

1271
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,800
Got my babies in the house.

1272
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:15,000
The man can't get no quality time...

1273
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,500
...but my partner gets
quality time.

1274
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:18,800
I don't play that shit.

1275
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,500
Somebody's out there!

1276
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:30,400
Get the kids. Get the kids!

1277
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:35,300
I knew it! I didn't
need a psychic.

1278
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,700
Freeze!

1279
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,500
Move, and you're dead.

1280
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:48,000
They're going to shoot each other.
This is unbelievable.

1281
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:49,500
Miami Police!
Freeze!

1282
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:51,300
I am the police!

1283
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,100
What are you doing?

1284
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:55,200
- You're doing Theresa!
- No, I'm not!

1285
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,800
- You're doing my baby!
- Shut up!

1286
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,100
We could sneak up and
snuff them both right now.

1287
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:03,700
But we want the girl.

1288
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:07,200
Never fuck with
a cop's family, asshole.

1289
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,200
- Doesn't that piss you off?
- Yeah.

1290
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:12,000
Don't get me started.
Out of the car.

1291
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,300
Motherfucker!

1292
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,500
Shit is making you crazy!

1293
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,600
You know it ain't going on between
me and Theresa!

1294
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:26,000
I've been your partner for six years...

1295
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:28,100
...and your boy all my life.

1296
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,000
For you to even think...!

1297
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:33,400
To let dumb shit
like that get in your mind!

1298
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,400
This is me!
What's your problem?

1299
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,300
Fucking...

1300
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:41,900
I'm just...

1301
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,100
I'm fine!

1302
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,900
Get out of here!
Where's Julie?

1303
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,500
She's in the car, handcuffed
to the steering wheel.

1304
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,700
Are you trying to blow this case?

1305
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:57,700
My bad.
I ain't had no quality time.

1306
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:01,700
You know how it is.
Sometimes you do dumb shit.

1307
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:06,900
My bad.

1308
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:08,800
It's cool.

1309
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:11,200
Go, go. All right.

1310
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:18,300
These phone calls were made
to Club Hell from this precinct.

1311
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,100
Explain.

1312
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:24,200
I'll ask you once more.
Give me a goddamn name!

1313
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:31,100
- All I know is his name.
- Give it to me.

1314
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:32,900
You're looking at
a lot of time.

1315
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,200
Fouchet.

1316
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,700
Fouchet, I think.

1317
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:39,700
That's his whole name?

1318
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,700
I'm just an errand boy.

1319
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:44,800
Stop. You'll make me cry.

1320
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:47,800
I swear. Watching the house
was my first gig.

1321
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,300
How sweet.
Does that make you union?

1322
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:52,800
If you were a real cop...

1323
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,100
...in the field, working every day...

1324
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:57,100
...you'd realize shit happens.

1325
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,800
Don't give me that!

1326
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:01,000
You're on your way
to reassignment.

1327
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:03,600
Who'll reassign me?
You?

1328
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:06,700
Until you have the authority
to reassign me...

1329
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,500
...stay the hell out of here.

1330
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:12,000
They should bone
and get it over with.

1331
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:15,000
I'm getting really tired of this.

1332
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,900
You're tired?

1333
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:23,100
They're overfed, lazy.
We need video surveillance.

1334
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:24,800
The guard dogs are nothing.

1335
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:28,100
Don't make this hard!

1336
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:34,000
Nice running into you, Jojo.

1337
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:37,000
Always making it
hard on yourself, Jojo.

1338
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:40,400
Gee, Julie,
what have you been up to?

1339
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:43,500
Just hanging out,
handcuffed to steering wheels.

1340
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:46,900
We're looking for someone
to step on some heroin.

1341
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:49,700
Do it fast and well.
A real pro.

1342
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:53,000
I told you, I'm
in the rubber business now.

1343
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,700
Jojo, we're not playing, man.

1344
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,800
I'm telling you, I'm straight.

1345
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:01,100
I'm straight like a board.

1346
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:03,000
I'm so straight, it's sick.

1347
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:06,600
It's a lot of dope.
Who could cut it real quick?

1348
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,800
Cut it?
You mean, cut it up?

1349
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,500
I'm sick of this bullshit.

1350
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,300
Bullshit!

1351
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:17,400
What's up?

1352
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:19,400
You're pulling a gun on me?

1353
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,900
You're cops! I should
turn you in to <i>Hard Copy</i>.

1354
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,600
Put your ass on TV.

1355
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:25,800
I got this.

1356
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:29,600
I got 15 bullets.

1357
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:34,900
If you don't start talking,
I'll fill you with hot shit.

1358
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:37,000
He's a former ganja-smoking fucker.

1359
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,000
- He ain't worth it.
- You want some?

1360
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,700
I'll bust your ass too!

1361
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,000
So sad.

1362
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:44,600
You're on your own.

1363
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:47,800
What's up?

1364
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,300
I'll tell you...

1365
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:52,900
...you splatter his ass,
he's no good to us. Fuck that!

1366
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:58,300
Fuck that! I'm not going down for you
killing Jojo the tire man!

1367
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,500
I don't want no brain fragments
in my clothes! It stinks!

1368
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:06,600
Fuck that!

1369
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,600
I'll tell you what I know.
I don't know everything about everything.

1370
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,600
Tell him something!

1371
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:13,600
3 guys.

1372
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:15,300
They got a laboratory.

1373
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:16,600
No, no.

1374
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,400
2 guys! One guy died in
a plane crash last year.

1375
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,300
Used to be more!

1376
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:26,800
No, it's one guy, really.
It's only one guy.

1377
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,700
Don't fuck with me.

1378
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,200
This guy's an Einstein,
genius college boy...

1379
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:35,200
...egghead motherfucker.
He got glasses.

1380
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,500
His rich parents
live in Coconut Grove.

1381
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:39,800
Where? Tell him again, Jojo!

1382
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,300
I'll tell you where.

1383
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,300
You'd do that?

1384
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,900
I want to help. Stick that gun down.
I got the address...

1385
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:51,400
...in the...

1386
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:53,500
...office.

1387
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,200
Thanks. Why don't you get it?

1388
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:58,400
Cool.

1389
01:26:58,700 --> 01:26:59,800
- Go.
- Now?

1390
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:02,300
Now's good. Now is real good.

1391
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:03,700
This is on me.

1392
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,900
Why don't you pick out
some white walls? A gift from me to you.

1393
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:13,700
You made me think
you were going to shoot me.

1394
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:15,100
I was.

1395
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:21,300
When's this punk-ass chemist
coming home?

1396
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,300
This is a stakeout.

1397
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,200
Not what I imagined.

1398
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:29,100
Thought there'd be more conversation.

1399
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,000
Sorry, it's not up to your...

1400
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:33,900
...usual high standards.

1401
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,900
Is he always like this on a stakeout?

1402
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,800
What is it?
Too much caffeine?

1403
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,600
Not enough sex?

1404
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,900
I can't believe she went there.

1405
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,800
You don't know who
you talking to?

1406
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:50,300
That's Mike Lowrey over there.

1407
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,300
King Ding-a-ling.

1408
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:55,800
Why don't you whip it out for her?

1409
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Yeah, right on your forehead.

1410
01:27:58,300 --> 01:27:59,400
Shut up.

1411
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,200
There he is!
Let's go!

1412
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,100
- Let's go!
- I'm on him!

1413
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,900
What are our chances?

1414
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,000
Remember Club Hell?

1415
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:31,500
Worse.

1416
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:38,000
That's it. Call major backup.
I want swimming ducks in here.

1417
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:39,500
Hold it.

1418
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:43,100
Sinclair tapped the phones.
We must do that in person.

1419
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:46,800
By the time we do that...

1420
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,700
...every junkie in America
will be high off our bust.

1421
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,000
Can we help you?

1422
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:59,100
I staked out all night
in that jalopy too. I earned a peek.

1423
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:03,600
This is real cop stuff, okay?
Not <i>Charlie's Angels.</i>

1424
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:06,100
Can't hurt for her to take a peek.

1425
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:10,200
It can't? If they fire a bullet over
here, it'll hurt!

1426
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:20,200
We have guests.

1427
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:24,400
Have them followed.
Call me with their location.

1428
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:34,600
<i>This high-speed chase, ending</i>
<i>near River and 34th Streets...</i>

1429
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:37,600
<i>...was captured 2 nights ago</i>
<i>by our news team.</i>

1430
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:40,200
Mom!

1431
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:47,400
I thought you said Daddy was in
Cleveland. Can't be.

1432
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,400
No. Your daddy just wishes
he was in Cleveland.

1433
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,500
I'm telling you, this Fouchet,
he's slick.

1434
01:29:57,700 --> 01:30:00,700
FBI, DEA, they got nothing on him.

1435
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:03,300
But he got to deal with us today.

1436
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,700
What's that?

1437
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:18,300
That's the last time they handcuff me.

1438
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,000
That's what.

1439
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:21,700
Good boy.

1440
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,700
Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am!

1441
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:28,000
All visitors must be announced!

1442
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:29,700
Pisses me off!

1443
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:31,800
Lady! Lady!

1444
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:36,500
When you get back,
this'll be over, right?

1445
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:38,100
You got that right.

1446
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:41,500
Now don't worry.
You'll be set free.

1447
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:42,800
Cut loose.

1448
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,800
You'll be back to your own life.

1449
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:48,900
No more handcuffs.

1450
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:56,700
- I'm out of here.
- That's Chet with my veggie burger.

1451
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,100
- Move your ass.
- You got it.

1452
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,500
Hi, can I help you?

1453
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:07,700
I'm here to kill
my husband, Marcus Burnett.

1454
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:10,700
The tall one,
or the short one?

1455
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,200
The short one.

1456
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:14,400
Thought so.

1457
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,200
Is Chet ringing--

1458
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,000
Oh, babe!

1459
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:25,900
Let me get your husband.

1460
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:27,800
Get over here.

1461
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:34,300
I know what it looks like.
Did you get my message?

1462
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,800
Can you...

1463
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,500
...leave me and...

1464
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,600
...Mrs. Burnett alone?

1465
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:44,500
Right.

1466
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:47,600
Y'all met?

1467
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:49,400
Baby...

1468
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:52,300
I know-- Let me--

1469
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:56,800
As far as I'm concerned, keep the
wedding ring in your pocket...

1470
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:58,700
...because you, your girlfriend...

1471
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,500
Oh, shit.

1472
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:03,700
...and Mike will be
very happy living here.

1473
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,800
Sweetie! Sweetie, honey!

1474
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,700
No, no, I saw it on the news.

1475
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:14,500
That shit's slanted.

1476
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,500
You're no longer welcome to my house.

1477
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:22,500
He didn't tell you
I was coming in early?

1478
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:25,900
Remember, I said call,
and that you'd bring me here?

1479
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,100
Tell her what I told you?

1480
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:29,900
You'd bring me here--

1481
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:35,200
I ain't even going to--

1482
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,000
We're not arguing.

1483
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:38,500
I'm raising my--

1484
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,200
All right-- Baby!

1485
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:42,000
We wanted to tell you.

1486
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:47,100
It really doesn't matter, Mike, Kojak--
whatever your name is.

1487
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:49,700
I'll tell you something else:

1488
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,900
If his wife can find us,
I'm better off on my own.

1489
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:55,400
This...

1490
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,400
I can see how it'd look a trip.

1491
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:01,400
You see me, I run out,
I got a shirt open.

1492
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:03,400
You see Mike half-naked.

1493
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,600
Then you see the white girl.

1494
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:10,100
It looks like we having an orgy,
and ain't nobody humped.

1495
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:12,700
Ain't nobody doing none of that.

1496
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:15,600
It's not what it looks like, okay?

1497
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:18,200
Baby, she's a material witness.

1498
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:20,900
That's real!

1499
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:22,800
Baby, Theresa, listen.

1500
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,600
It was orders.
Listen, it was orders.

1501
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:31,100
Can I talk to you?
Can you stop so I can talk to you?

1502
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:34,800
Enough smooth shit, Mike.
It's not going to work anymore.

1503
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:45,100
I don't care!

1504
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:52,900
Duck!

1505
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:54,300
Julie, get down!

1506
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:55,700
Get down!

1507
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:28,500
Get out!

1508
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:37,500
911!

1509
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,800
911? Chet here.

1510
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,200
Go upstairs and take this!
Take it!

1511
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:50,300
I'll keep everyone calm
until my backup comes.

1512
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:52,100
I love you.

1513
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,200
I forgot to give the address!

1514
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:32,800
Go, go, go!

1515
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:34,000
Watch out!

1516
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:35,700
Keep going!

1517
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,200
Get her in!

1518
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:09,200
Move!

1519
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
It's okay.

1520
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:27,100
I'm with the police. It's cool.
You look great.

1521
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:55,200
Drive!

1522
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:33,800
Don't ever say I wasn't there for you.

1523
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,100
<i>What is it with you?</i>

1524
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:50,500
How come it always has to be
good news/bad news?

1525
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:54,100
You know where the dope is, but you lose
our witness.

1526
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:55,600
I don't get it!

1527
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:57,000
Telephone!

1528
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:04,800
I'm keeping your friend for 4
hours, until I make my deal.

1529
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,300
And I will make it.

1530
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:09,400
I just put a bullet in the chemist...

1531
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:12,300
...who fucked with my timetable.

1532
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:15,600
The other one is for the girl. Okay?

1533
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,400
Son of a bitch!

1534
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,900
That twisted motherfucker
shot one of his employees.

1535
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:25,600
Says if we don't back up,
he'll kill Julie.

1536
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:26,900
Not now!

1537
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,600
I told you to play by the rules.

1538
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,300
I'm on the verge of solving this case!

1539
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,800
I've finally got the authority
to shut you down.

1540
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:36,700
You're all reassigned.

1541
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:45,700
This guy is painting me into a corner.

1542
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:48,100
We won't let the girl die.

1543
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:51,500
We're not walking away.
I don't care what she says.

1544
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:53,800
The deal goes down in 4 hours.

1545
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:57,000
You got 2 hours to find them.

1546
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,800
It's time to get lucky.

1547
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,500
Go do what you got to do.

1548
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:09,100
You told us that this thing would
move a little quicker.

1549
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:13,000
It's not that easy.
If it was, you'd be doing it.

1550
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:16,000
Work your magic.
You say you're a computer whiz.

1551
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,400
Back off! I'm doing an illegal
favor for you.

1552
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:22,600
This is what I went to jail for.

1553
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,200
So you back up off me.

1554
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,500
You don't sit your lanky ass down...

1555
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:30,100
...bottom line,
I will knock you out.

1556
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:31,400
What's wrong with you?

1557
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:34,000
- Can you have a seat?
- You said I'd get out of jail.

1558
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:35,800
And I wasn't lying.

1559
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:40,500
Cops are so dumb. Look.

1560
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:45,000
Remember, you promised
to get me out.

1561
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,200
Eddie Dominguez.

1562
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:51,000
There it is.

1563
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:56,100
Girlfriend?

1564
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,600
It was New Year's Eve,
and my ex-boyfriend, Eddie...

1565
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:09,700
...and this French guy...

1566
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:12,900
...they took some
horrible pictures of me.

1567
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:14,300
They said...

1568
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:18,600
...they'd post them
at my kid's school...

1569
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:21,800
...unless I gave them
narcotics information.

1570
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,600
But I never, never gave them you...

1571
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,200
...or the girl.

1572
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,900
They got her.
We need to get them now.

1573
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:33,000
If we don't, she's dead.
How do you make contact?

1574
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:35,300
I have their mobile-phone number.

1575
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:40,000
I know, I'm sorry.

1576
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:43,200
I'll make it up to you.
I will.

1577
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:45,500
We don't have time. Let's go.

1578
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:51,400
You have sexy ears, you know that?

1579
01:40:51,700 --> 01:40:53,100
I want to lick them.

1580
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:58,400
Can I speak to Romeo?

1581
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:00,600
There's no Romeo here, asshole.

1582
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:02,200
What're you laughing at?

1583
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:07,000
This cellphone will triangulate him,
no matter where he goes.

1584
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:09,500
We watch the map until he stops.

1585
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:15,500
The signal's still strong.

1586
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:17,600
Come on.

1587
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:20,400
Thank you.

1588
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:23,900
Lucy was the queen, baby.
Think about it.

1589
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:26,200
Lucille Ball was a bimbo.

1590
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:29,200
- Desi was the brains behind it.
- How can you say that?

1591
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:30,400
What do you mean?

1592
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:32,900
Take the bongos away, he's nothing.

1593
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:34,400
It's conga!

1594
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:37,200
Yo, fellas, what's up?

1595
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:39,600
The fucking pencil squad.

1596
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:41,400
Are we on traffic duty?

1597
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:45,100
No, this is real.
We got something for you.

1598
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:46,600
You could get killed.

1599
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,000
Let's go.

1600
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:06,800
It's Conrad.

1601
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:08,800
I'm calling in a favor.

1602
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,300
Eastbound towards 135th Street.

1603
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:17,100
Northeast, go northeast.

1604
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:20,000
If I'm wrong, you can fire me.

1605
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,100
This is what I need:

1606
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:26,000
I need a SWAT team, helicopters.
We're calling all cars.

1607
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:28,500
Only I don't know where I need them.

1608
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:31,500
Nice car.

1609
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:33,000
Oh, yeah.

1610
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:34,800
That's my toy.

1611
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,300
I'm taking it with me
for my collection.

1612
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,700
And how about the wire transfers?

1613
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:45,100
Two wire transfers to your banks...

1614
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:48,400
...totaling 180 million dollars.

1615
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:51,300
And 20 in cash.

1616
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:57,800
Damn.

1617
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,600
This has been a shitty week.

1618
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,700
Getting full integration on that signal.

1619
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:15,800
We're on the airfield now.

1620
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,100
I bet it's up in the old hangar section.

1621
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:26,300
Pick it up! Pick it up!

1622
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:29,300
Deposit confirmation requested.

1623
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:31,700
$90 million, Geldersbank of Zurich.

1624
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:38,000
No easy approach.

1625
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:39,700
No time.
Fuck the backup.

1626
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,300
We must go now.

1627
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:43,900
Not a problem.

1628
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:50,000
You got an itch?
I'd love to scratch it.

1629
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:53,600
- Scratch this.
- I'll scratch whatever you want.

1630
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:56,300
Did you go to college?

1631
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:08,100
Thank you.

1632
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:12,600
- You sure you want to do this?
- Let's go!

1633
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:14,400
Tuck in your skirt.

1634
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:16,400
My shit always works sometimes.

1635
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:24,400
This is the best you can buy.
Nice doing business with you.

1636
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Oh, shit.

1637
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:39,900
It's a setup!

1638
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:48,700
If I get killed,
I'm fucking you up!

1639
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,100
Goddamn it, go!

1640
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:57,700
Go, goddamn it!

1641
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:17,200
My God!

1642
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:37,400
Get down!

1643
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:46,900
You forgot your boarding pass!

1644
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:13,100
You motherfuckers!

1645
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:15,200
What's up?

1646
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Shit!

1647
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:13,800
Let's go!

1648
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:15,600
Get in the car!

1649
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:20,800
Get in, Mike! Come on!

1650
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:22,700
Get in!

1651
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:24,500
Get in the car!

1652
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:26,900
This shit's going to blow!

1653
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:29,500
Get up!

1654
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:53,600
Shit! Please, catch that motherfucker,
he shot me.

1655
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:55,500
He shot me!

1656
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:59,800
I'm fine. I just had a run-in
with Jim Brown over here.

1657
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:03,000
He steals our shit...

1658
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:04,400
...kidnaps Julie...

1659
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:08,100
...shoots at my wife.
We beat him down!

1660
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:14,500
Marcus, I just got
one question for you.

1661
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:17,900
How can you leave me at a gunfight
to get the car?!

1662
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:20,400
Shut up and let him drive.

1663
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:30,800
Getting shot improved
your driving skills.

1664
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,800
You got the right to remain silent.

1665
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:43,000
Anything you say will be used
against you in a court of law.

1666
01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:44,200
What're you doing?

1667
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:45,400
Getting it out the way.

1668
01:49:56,300 --> 01:49:57,600
Punch it!

1669
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:05,200
What if his car's faster?

1670
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:06,400
It's not!

1671
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:10,100
It'll be one or the other!
It'll be him or it'll be us!

1672
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,400
You better win!

1673
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:18,200
You better win!

1674
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:40,700
That's how you're supposed to drive!

1675
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:43,700
From now on, that's how you drive!

1676
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:11,600
Freeze!

1677
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:18,200
He ain't worth killing.

1678
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:24,100
Freeze!

1679
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:54,900
Bet when your punk-ass
woke up this morning...

1680
01:51:55,100 --> 01:51:58,900
...you didn't think by 5:00
you'd have a hole in your leg.

1681
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:05,300
You couldn't kill me,
you chickenshit, could you?

1682
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
I could.
You're talking like it's over.

1683
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:09,600
I'm just pausing.

1684
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:13,200
I'm getting the hang of this
marksman shit.

1685
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:17,400
Shooting them from 30 yards
while they run, that's not it.

1686
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:18,800
Here's where it is.

1687
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:21,200
Up close and personal.

1688
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:25,000
That's what I'm talking about.

1689
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:26,700
Would you do it?

1690
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:28,700
Step off!

1691
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:31,500
Do it!

1692
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:32,600
Do it!

1693
01:52:41,700 --> 01:52:43,000
It's over.

1694
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:50,200
He's a joke.

1695
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:52,500
He's a motherfucking joke.

1696
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,700
<i>I ever tell you I love you, man?</i>

1697
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:25,200
<i>You always be getting emotional</i>
<i>after a gunfight.</i>

1698
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:27,600
<i>Because I'm glad we survived.</i>

1699
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:29,400
<i>Shit.</i>

1700
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:34,500
I love you too.

1701
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:38,800
Don't be looking at me. I love you.
I said that shit.

1702
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
You my boy!

1703
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:42,900
No, no, you like my brother, man.

1704
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:44,700
So what am I?

1705
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:49,100
Julie, sweetie, you...

1706
01:53:49,300 --> 01:53:51,300
You're a little dangerous.

1707
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:55,500
See, you like a magnet
for random gunfire.

1708
01:53:56,500 --> 01:53:57,900
But you're cool.

1709
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:00,300
You're down.

1710
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:03,800
So what's next?

1711
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:08,300
See...

1712
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:10,700
...there won't be no next.

1713
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:15,600
You wanted Mike Lowrey...

1714
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:17,000
...you got him.

1715
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:18,600
That's Mike.

1716
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:20,000
Old Mike Lowrey.

1717
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:23,900
I'm going home to my wife
to get my quality time.

1718
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:26,000
Stop playing, man.

1719
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:29,000
I've been beat 3 times out here.

1720
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:33,200
I'm cool, I don't need no help.
Back up.

1721
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:37,600
Why're you going home to your wife?
Your dick probably don't work.

1722
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:40,100
Do you have the keys?

1723
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:43,600
Mike wanted me to go
to this gunfight, then...

1724
01:54:43,900 --> 01:54:46,300
Well, then
there was this witness...

1725
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:49,000
My man!

1726
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:50,900
You let me out of here?

1727
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:54,900
- I don't got the keys.
- What do you mean you don't have keys?!
