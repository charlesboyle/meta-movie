1
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:47,488
<i>Flight. We have the crew crossing gantry
for capsule ingress.</i>

2
00:00:47,572 --> 00:00:49,240
<i>Roger that.</i>

3
00:00:49,323 --> 00:00:51,784
<i>Inspired by the late President Kennedy,</i>

4
00:00:51,826 --> 00:00:56,789
<i>in only seven years, America has risen
to the challenge of what he called...</i>

5
00:00:56,831 --> 00:01:00,668
<i>"the most hazardous and dangerous
and greatest adventure...</i>

6
00:01:00,752 --> 00:01:03,129
<i>on which man has ever embarked."</i>

7
00:01:03,212 --> 00:01:07,467
<i>After trailing the Russians for years
with our manned space program,</i>

8
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,854
<i>- We got a short!
- And after that sudden, horrible fire...</i>

9
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:13,473
<i>on the launchpad
during a routine test...</i>

10
00:01:13,556 --> 00:01:16,309
<i>- that killed American astronauts Gus Grissom...
- Fire in the cockpit!</i>

11
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:18,478
<i>- Ed White and Roger Chaffee...
- Get us outta here!</i>

12
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:22,450
<i>There were serious doubts that we
could beat the Russians to the moon.</i>

13
00:01:22,513 --> 00:01:26,235
<i>But tonight, a mere 18 months
after the tragedy of Apollo 1...</i>

14
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,490
<i>the entire world watched in awe
as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin...</i>

15
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:32,533
<i>landed on the moon.</i>

16
00:01:32,617 --> 00:01:34,827
<i>The big news came
just a moment ago.</i>

17
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:37,789
<i>Mission Control gave
the spacecraft permission...</i>

18
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,833
<i>to go for
the extravehicular activity...</i>

19
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,835
<i>that is, for the walk
on the moon...</i>

20
00:01:42,856 --> 00:01:47,673
<i>far earlier than anticipated,
9:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.</i>

21
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:53,638
Important thing when you're penetrating the lunar
module is your attitude and your relative speed.

22
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:56,682
Let's say this is me in the command
module and this is you...

23
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:58,684
- All right.
- In the LEM.

24
00:01:58,768 --> 00:02:00,528
This thing sticks out here in front.
That's called a probe.

25
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:02,522
- Is that true?
- Absolutely.

26
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:07,610
And Tracey, when you feel that thing
slide in, everything's clickin'...

27
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:09,862
it's like no other
feeling in the world.

28
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:14,367
- A little liquid propulsion.
- What's the big occasion?

29
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:16,411
How's it goin' up there at Mission Control?

30
00:02:16,494 --> 00:02:19,163
It's a nervous time. They're pacin'
around, smokin' like chimneys.

31
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,624
Gene Kranz is gonna have puppies.
Jim Lovell.

32
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:23,459
- Hi.
- This is Tracey.

33
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,037
- How do ya do, Tracey?
- This is the man.

34
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:29,048
Gemini 7. Gemini 12. Apollo 8.
They were the first ones around the moon.

35
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:30,550
This guy did ten laps.

36
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:33,052
With one hand on the wheel.
Make yourselves at home.

37
00:02:33,135 --> 00:02:34,895
- Hey, Marilyn.
- Where have you been?

38
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:37,432
This is the last champagne
in the city of Houston.

39
00:02:37,514 --> 00:02:39,433
- Very good. Very good.
- Everything else all right?

40
00:02:39,517 --> 00:02:42,228
- Everything's on course.
- Looks okay. Hey! Cadet Lovell.

41
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:45,231
- Hey, Dad.
- Put this on ice back with the rest and make sure it gets cold.

42
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:48,234
- You gonna get a haircut this week?
- I'm on vacation.

43
00:02:48,317 --> 00:02:51,070
Oh, get a haircut.

44
00:02:57,836 --> 00:02:59,662
Well, hello there.

45
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:03,416
- I wouldn't mind bein' up there tonight.
- God, who wouldn't.

46
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:06,419
Don't worry. Our day's comin'.

47
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:09,464
They're not gonna cut
the program before number 14.

48
00:03:10,171 --> 00:03:11,841
- You know, my cousin called.
- Uh-huh.

49
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,260
Asked who we bribed
to get on Jim Lovell's crew.

50
00:03:14,343 --> 00:03:15,595
Yeah.

51
00:03:15,635 --> 00:03:19,097
I just told him they wanted
to make sure he got the best.

52
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,434
Well, they got that right.

53
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:25,855
- What network do we want?
- Come on! Walt! Hey! Put on Walter!

54
00:03:25,897 --> 00:03:27,857
- Walter!
- Jules Bergman!

55
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:29,358
John, turn it up!

56
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,779
<i>...has completed putting on
the spacesuits and the boots.</i>

57
00:03:32,862 --> 00:03:37,867
I, uh... I really appreciate you all
coming to this dress rehearsal party...

58
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,657
for my Apollo 12 landing.

59
00:03:40,703 --> 00:03:42,070
Sit down, Conrad.

60
00:03:42,117 --> 00:03:45,166
I think we should all take
a moment to recognize...

61
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,079
the exemplary...
hell, damn near heroic...

62
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:54,383
effort displayed by Neil Armstrong's
backup for this historic moon walk...

63
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:56,510
and, of course, his crew.

64
00:03:56,589 --> 00:03:59,550
Let's hear it for Jim Lovell,
Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise.

65
00:04:04,268 --> 00:04:08,231
There he is! There he is!
Everybody quiet down!

66
00:04:08,946 --> 00:04:10,400
Hey! Kids!

67
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:13,236
<i>We had a good touchdown.</i>

68
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:18,658
<i>Okay we can verify the position of the
opening I ought to have on the camera.</i>

69
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:21,953
<i>What?</i>

70
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:26,207
- Think it's too late for him to abort?
- He still has time to get out.

71
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:28,960
He just needs somebody to wave him off.
Pull up, Neil!

72
00:04:29,043 --> 00:04:32,255
Pull up! Pull up!

73
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:36,592
<i>Okay, Neil, we can see you
coming down the ladder now.</i>

74
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:38,719
<i>Look at those pictures. Wow.</i>

75
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:41,514
<i>I'm, uh, at the foot of the ladder.</i>

76
00:04:41,597 --> 00:04:46,310
<i>The LEM footpads are only depressed
in the surface about, uh...</i>

77
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:48,438
<i>one or two inches.</i>

78
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,774
<i>- It's almost like a powder.
- Armstrong is on the moon.</i>

79
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:55,403
<i>Neil Armstrong,
38-year-old American...</i>

80
00:04:55,445 --> 00:04:58,281
<i>standing on the surface
of the moon...</i>

81
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:02,910
<i>on this July 20th, 1969.</i>

82
00:05:02,952 --> 00:05:05,830
<i>That's one small step for man...</i>

83
00:05:07,857 --> 00:05:11,461
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

84
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,504
<i>His quote was...</i>

00:05:13,588 --> 00:05:19,343

89
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:35,735
- You're drunk, Lovell.
- Yeah.

90
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:37,945
I'm not used to the champagne.

91
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:39,947
Me neither.

92
00:05:43,562 --> 00:05:45,912
I can't deal with cleaning up.
Let's sell the house.

93
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:48,498
All right, let's sell the house.

94
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:53,044
They're back inside now
lookin' up at us.

95
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:55,254
Isn't that somethin'?

96
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:59,717
I bet Jannie Armstrong doesn't
get a wink of sleep tonight.

97
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:03,679
When you were on the far side on 8,
I didn't sleep at all.

98
00:06:03,721 --> 00:06:06,390
I just vacuumed
over and over again.

99
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:11,687
Christopher Columbus,
Charles Lindbergh and Neil Armstrong.

100
00:06:14,103 --> 00:06:15,983
Neil Armstrong.

101
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,540
From now on, we live in a world
where man has walked on the moon.

102
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:34,585
It's not a miracle.

103
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,297
We just decided to go.

104
00:06:39,635 --> 00:06:41,843
On Apollo 8, we were so close...

105
00:06:42,164 --> 00:06:45,543
just 60 nautical miles down and...

106
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:50,560
It was like I could just...

107
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,355
step out and walk
on the face of it.

108
00:06:59,277 --> 00:07:01,738
I want to go back there.

109
00:07:08,111 --> 00:07:09,746
Where's my mountain?

110
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,416
Well, it... Up there.

111
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,752
It's, uh, right up by the...

112
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:21,090
It's... Okay, do you see where the
shadow crosses the white area there?

113
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,800
That's the Sea of Tranquillity...

114
00:07:22,884 --> 00:07:25,261
and your mountain's right there
on the edge of that.

115
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:28,014
It's your mountain.
Your mountain, Marilyn. Mount Marilyn.

116
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,725
I don't see it.

117
00:07:33,573 --> 00:07:35,521
Well, you gotta look harder.

118
00:07:38,461 --> 00:07:40,526
You... You... You look harder...

00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,864

This is divine inspiration, folks.</i>

128
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:16,229
<i>It's the best part of each one of us,
the belief that anything is possible.</i>

129
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,982
Things like a computer
that can fit into a single room...

130
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,861
and hold millions of pieces
of information...

131
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,614
or the Saturn 5 rocket.

132
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:29,659
This is the actual launch vehicle
that will be taking Alan Shepard...

133
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:33,996
and his crew on the first leg
of the Apollo 13 mission.

134
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:36,999
When are you
going up again, Jim?

135
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:41,087
I'm slated to be the commander
of Apollo 14 sometime late next year.

136
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,382
If there is an Apollo 14.

137
00:08:45,986 --> 00:08:50,179
Now Jim, people in my state have been
asking why we're continuing...

138
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:54,100
to fund this program now that we've
beaten the Russians to the moon.

139
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,332
Imagine if Christopher Columbus
had come back from the new world...

140
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:59,637
and no one returned
in his footsteps.

141
00:08:59,715 --> 00:09:03,901
<i>Attention, all personnel.
Clear level three. Clear level three.</i>

142
00:09:03,985 --> 00:09:06,070
Are there any other questions?

143
00:09:07,238 --> 00:09:09,449
How do you go
to the bathroom in space?

144
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,744
Well, I tell you,
it's a highly technical process...

145
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:17,165
of cranking down the window and
looking for a gas station, which, uh...

146
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:20,334
Oh, there's Deke Slayton.

147
00:09:20,618 --> 00:09:23,379
Deke, you might be able to answer
this lady's question better than I.

148
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:27,300
Deke is one of the original Mercury
seven astronauts, ladies and gentlemen.

149
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:30,720
Now he's our boss. He hands out
the astronauts' flight assignments...

150
00:09:30,762 --> 00:09:33,806
so naturally we kick back part of
our salaries to Deke every month.

151
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,310
- How much this month?
- Can I have a minute? Something's come up.

152
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:39,312
Sure, you b... Uh, Henry?

153
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:42,774
Hey!

154
00:09:46,444 --> 00:09:50,239
- Anybody home?
- I'm not being a cheerleader, Mom!

155
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,064
You don't understand!
I worked so hard on this!

156
00:09:52,103 --> 00:09:53,868
Barbara, maybe I don't understand...

157
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,246
but you are not wearing that out in this
neighbourhood. That's the end of it.

158
00:09:57,288 --> 00:09:59,342
She's not even wearing a bra!
You can see everything!

159
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:00,897
- Shut up!
- Susan!

160
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:03,753
- Everybody. Marilyn, trick or treat.
- Jim.

161
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:07,673
You know that Easter vacation trip
we had planned for Acapulco?

162
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:09,175
Uh-oh.

163
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:12,178
I was thinkin' there might be
a slight change in destination.

164
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:14,722
Really?

165
00:10:14,764 --> 00:10:17,892
Maybe, say... the moon.

166
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:23,356
Al Shepard's ear infection
has flared up...

167
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:27,610
and we've all been bumped up
to the prime crew of Apollo 13.

168
00:10:28,364 --> 00:10:31,948
Straight to the head of the line
and the Fra Mauro highlands.

169
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:34,742
Six months?
You're moving up six months?

170
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:38,287
- Dad, can I please wear this?
- Sure.

171
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,748
- Jim.
- No! No. Absolutely not.

172
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,668
<i>- ♪ Don't you want somebody to love ♪</i>
- This stinks!

173
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:46,087
They're not rushing things, are they?

174
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:48,131
You're gonna be ready
in six months?

175
00:10:48,172 --> 00:10:51,972
We'll be ready. Boy, I wouldn't want
to be around Al Shepard tonight.

176
00:10:52,074 --> 00:10:54,971
I gotta get over there.
We're gonna have to get up to speed.

177
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,889
Go. Go.

178
00:10:56,973 --> 00:10:59,225
I'm gonna walk
on the moon, Marilyn.

179
00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:02,603
I know. I can't believe it.

180
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:06,149
Naturally, it's 13.
Why 13?

181
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,276
It comes after 12, hon.

182
00:11:10,993 --> 00:11:15,391
<i>Apollo 13, you are go for
pyro arm and docking.</i>

183
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:19,537
<i>All systems are nominal
and on the line.</i>

184
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,209
<i>Okay, S-4B is stable,
slot panels are drifting free.</i>

185
00:11:23,256 --> 00:11:28,045
<i>The drogue is clear.
The docking target is clear.</i>

186
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:32,133
<i>Okay, I'm comin' up on that now.
Two... one... mark.</i>

187
00:11:32,175 --> 00:11:35,193
Seventy-five feet.
We're comin' up on docking.

188
00:11:35,224 --> 00:11:39,432
Let's shut down some thrusters on 'em.
We'll see what he does with this one.

189
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,769
Whoa. Wait a minute.

190
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:45,104
I lost something here.
I can't translate up.

191
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:48,524
Houston, we are drifting
down and away.

192
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:51,527
- Wanna back off and take another run at this?
- No, I got it. I got it.

193
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:54,655
Let me just try
and get it stable here.

194
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:59,327
- Houston, I'm gonna reset the high gain.
- Got the target back in the reticle.

195
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:01,704
We're stable.
Go ahead and recycle the valves.

196
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,874
- Forty feet.
- They're all gray.

197
00:12:07,752 --> 00:12:10,213
Twenty.

198
00:12:10,254 --> 00:12:13,132
- Easy.
- Ten feet.

199
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:19,138
- Capture.
- That's it!

200
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:22,892
- That's it.
- Sweet move, Ken. Beautiful.

201
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:26,396
- Gentlemen, that is the way we do that.
- Man, that woke me up.

202
00:12:26,437 --> 00:12:31,317
<i>Apollo 13 backup crew,
you're up in the simulator.</i>

203
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:34,424
- Nice job, gentlemen.
- That's three hours of boredom...

204
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,823
followed by seven seconds
of sheer terror.

205
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:40,368
Good job, guys.
You just won the Christmas turkey.

206
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,747
Nice try, Frank.
You really outfoxed 'em, brother.

207
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:47,708
Yeah, but it wasn't perfect.
Used up too much fuel.

208
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,710
You're above the curve.

209
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:53,423
Not by much. Listen, guys,
I wanna work it again.

210
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:58,553
Hey, we gotta be up with the dawn patrol
headed for Bethpage, what, 0700?

211
00:12:58,594 --> 00:13:00,555
- Wheels up at 0700.
- Yeah, I know...

212
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:03,307
but my rate of turn
is still a little slow there.

213
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:06,102
I really think
we should work it again.

214
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:11,274
- Well, let's get it right.
- Okay, set it up again, Frank.

215
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,185
<i>Okay, 13 backup crew.
It'll have to wait.</i>

216
00:13:14,232 --> 00:13:18,448
<i>- Prime crew's up for another run.
- Yeah, baby.</i>

217
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:23,807
<i>Apollo 13, we show S-4B shutdown
and all systems are nominal.</i>

218
00:13:23,838 --> 00:13:26,112
<i>Fred, set the S-band omni to B...</i>

219
00:13:26,151 --> 00:13:29,208
<i>and when you get
in the LEM, two forward.</i>

220
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:33,045
<i>Good shape over here.</i>

221
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:35,120
Hey, we got a problem.

222
00:13:37,675 --> 00:13:41,554
- Ken, get your helmet on!
- I can't get it locked!

223
00:13:46,053 --> 00:13:47,560
Oh, God!

224
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:00,907
Jim!

225
00:14:14,504 --> 00:14:19,842
I thought the stars
would fall down on you.

226
00:14:19,884 --> 00:14:23,096
That's silly.
Stars can't fall on us.

227
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:25,098
You're a smarter kid than I was.

228
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:27,809
How long will it take
to get to the moon?

229
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,599
Four days.
But that's pretty fast.

230
00:14:32,662 --> 00:14:35,900
See, this is
the Saturn 4B booster...

231
00:14:35,983 --> 00:14:39,028
and it shoots us
away from the Earth...

232
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:43,157
as fast as a bullet from a gun...

233
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:47,787
until the moon's gravity
actually grabs us and pulls us...

234
00:14:48,738 --> 00:14:52,166
into a circle around the moon...

235
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,210
which is called an orbit.

236
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,977
All right?

237
00:14:56,071 --> 00:14:59,090
Fred and I float down the tunnel
into the lunar module...

238
00:14:59,173 --> 00:15:01,092
this spidery-lookin' guy.

239
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:05,179
Only holds two people,
and it's just for landin' on the moon.

240
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:08,224
And I take the controls
and I steer it around...

241
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:10,393
and I fly it down...

242
00:15:10,435 --> 00:15:14,147
adjustin' it here,
the attitude there, pitch, roll...

243
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,984
for a nice, soft landing
on the moon.

244
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:21,487
Better than Neil Armstrong.
Way better than Pete Conrad.

245
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:29,662
Dad... did you know
the astronauts in the fire?

246
00:15:32,711 --> 00:15:36,798
Yeah. Yeah, I did. I knew the
astronauts in the fire. All of 'em.

247
00:15:40,002 --> 00:15:42,212
Could that happen again?

248
00:15:43,348 --> 00:15:45,137
Well, I'll tell ya
somethin' about that fire.

249
00:15:45,185 --> 00:15:48,848
Um, a lot of things went wrong.

250
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:53,436
The, uh... The door.

251
00:15:53,688 --> 00:15:58,066
It's called the hatch. They couldn't
get it open when they needed to get out.

252
00:15:58,107 --> 00:16:01,277
That was one thing. And, uh...

253
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:04,864
Well, a lot of things
went wrong in that fire.

254
00:16:07,824 --> 00:16:09,118
Did they fix it?

255
00:16:09,784 --> 00:16:12,622
Oh, yes. Absolutely.
We fixed it.

256
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,241
It's not a problem anymore.

257
00:16:26,145 --> 00:16:28,903
I can't believe they still
have you doing public appearances.

258
00:16:28,942 --> 00:16:33,239
Well, Henry Hurt was... all over me.

259
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:35,934
I know. But with a training
schedule this tight...

260
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:39,816
Well, it's... It's the program, Marilyn.
You know, it's NASA.

261
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,568
Hey! Hey, you're
Jim Lovell, aren't ya?

262
00:16:43,094 --> 00:16:44,987
Hey! Lucky 13!

263
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:47,115
Right on!

264
00:16:55,206 --> 00:16:57,250
That's the second time
it's done that.

265
00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:09,303
So I was looking at the kids'
school schedule coming up.

266
00:17:10,108 --> 00:17:10,805
Yeah?

267
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:14,225
- It's a very busy week.
- Yeah.

268
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:18,062
I'm thinking about
not going to the launch.

269
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:23,025
Huh.

270
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,695
The kids need me at home, honey.

271
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:29,824
Marilyn, we've had
these kids for awhile now.

272
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:32,869
They've never kept you from
comin' to the other launches.

273
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,246
But now we have your mother.
She's just had this stroke.

274
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:36,479
Mom's fine.

275
00:17:36,518 --> 00:17:38,791
Honey, it's not like I've
never been to a launch before.

276
00:17:38,831 --> 00:17:41,713
The other wives
have not done three.

277
00:17:41,752 --> 00:17:45,757
I just don't think
I can go through all that.

278
00:17:49,761 --> 00:17:52,680
I'll just be glad
when this one is over.

279
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:59,546
Well, you're gonna miss
a hell of a show.

280
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:08,610
- Jim.
- Hey, guys. See ya in a few weeks.

281
00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:12,366
Take care.
Bring us back a moon rock.

282
00:18:37,931 --> 00:18:40,728
So the number 13
doesn't bother you.

283
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,772
Only if it's a Friday, Phil.

284
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:47,235
Apollo 13, lifting off
at 1300 hours and 13 minutes...

285
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:50,613
and entering the moon's
gravity on April 13?

286
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:54,426
Uh, Ken Mattingly here has been
doing some scientific experiments...

287
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:56,617
regarding that very phenomenon,
haven't you?

288
00:18:56,702 --> 00:19:01,749
Uh, yes. Well, I had a black cat,
uh, walk over a broken mirror...

289
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,668
under the lunar module ladder.

290
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:05,088
It didn't seem to be a problem.

291
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:07,612
We'd also considered a really helpful
letter we got from a fella...

292
00:19:07,673 --> 00:19:11,619
who said we oughta take
a pig with us for good luck.

293
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:14,971
Does it bother you that the public
regards this flight as routine?

294
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:18,975
There's nothing routine about flying
to the moon. I can vouch for that.

295
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:23,813
And, uh, I think that
an astronaut's last mission...

296
00:19:23,855 --> 00:19:28,860
his final flight... that's always
going to be very special.

297
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:31,237
Why is this your last, Jim?

298
00:19:31,976 --> 00:19:35,074
I'm in command
of the best ship...

299
00:19:35,158 --> 00:19:38,161
with the best crew
that anybody could ask for...

300
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,692
and I'll be walking in a place
where there's 400 degrees difference...

301
00:19:41,724 --> 00:19:45,168
between sunlight and shadow.

302
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:49,547
I can't imagine, uh,
ever topping that.

303
00:19:54,802 --> 00:19:57,346
We have that scheduled
for 0900 hours tomorrow.

304
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,474
- That's not gonna work, Walter.
- Why?

305
00:19:59,897 --> 00:20:03,519
Freddo and I are gonna be goin' over the
lunar surface experiments tomorrow...

306
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:06,022
and Ken's gonna be
back in the simulator.

307
00:20:06,064 --> 00:20:08,107
We're gonna be goin' over
the flight plan tonight as well.

308
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:12,028
Gonna pay a visit to this machine
after you're hard down. Thanks.

309
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,614
Jim, we've got a problem.

310
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:19,869
We just got some blood work back from
the lab. Charlie Duke has the measles.

311
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,371
So we need a new backup.

312
00:20:22,413 --> 00:20:26,334
- You've all been exposed to it.
- Oh, I've had the measles.

313
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,045
Ken Mattingly hasn't.

314
00:20:29,516 --> 00:20:33,382
You wanna break up my crew
two days before the launch...

315
00:20:33,424 --> 00:20:37,678
when we can predict each other's moves,
read the tone of each other's voices?

316
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,847
Ken Mattingly will be
getting seriously ill...

317
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:44,227
precisely when you and Haise will be ascending
from the lunar surface to rendezvous with him.

318
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:46,229
Jim, that's a lousy time for a fever.

319
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,065
Now look. Jack Swigert has been
out of the loop for weeks.

320
00:20:49,107 --> 00:20:51,317
He's fully qualified
to fly this mission.

321
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:54,987
He's a fine pilot, but when was
the last time he was in a simulator?

322
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:58,366
I'm sorry, Jim.
I understand how you feel.

323
00:20:58,408 --> 00:21:00,368
We can do one of two things here.

324
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,746
We can either scrub Mattingly
and go with Swigert...

325
00:21:03,788 --> 00:21:07,041
or we can bump all three of you
to a later mission.

326
00:21:11,362 --> 00:21:15,258
I've trained
for the Fra Mauro highlands...

327
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:18,594
and this is flight surgeon
horseshit, Deke!

328
00:21:19,268 --> 00:21:23,683
Jim, if you hold out for Ken,
you will not be on Apollo 13.

329
00:21:24,297 --> 00:21:26,424
It's your decision.

330
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:31,274
Oh, let it ring.

331
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:33,505
Listen, I-I gotta take that.

332
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:36,446
- Oh, why?
- Because I'm on the backup crew...

333
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:40,207
and the backup crew has to set up
the guest list and book the hotel room.

334
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:43,619
Swigert. Yeah.

335
00:21:43,661 --> 00:21:46,080
<i>♪ I looked all around ♪</i>

336
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:50,960
Yes. Yes, sir.
Uh-uh, I understand.

337
00:21:51,002 --> 00:21:54,422
- Thank you, sir.
<i>- ♪ Why don't you come with me, little girl ♪</i>

338
00:21:54,464 --> 00:21:56,132
<i>♪ On a magic carpet ride ♪</i>

339
00:21:56,215 --> 00:22:00,303
<i>♪ Well, you don't know

340
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:03,181
<i>♪ Why don't you tell

341
00:22:16,778 --> 00:22:18,821
Well, I, uh...

342
00:22:22,945 --> 00:22:24,863
Damn.

343
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:32,502
Medical guys.

344
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:37,840
I had a feeling when they started doing
all the blood tests that, uh...

345
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:45,848
I mean, I know it's their ass if I get
sick up there, but, I mean... Jesus!

346
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:01,697
Oh, boy.

347
00:23:02,418 --> 00:23:05,493
Swigert, he'll be fine. He's, uh...

348
00:23:07,832 --> 00:23:09,705
He's strong.

349
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:16,087
It'll be a hell of a mission.
One for the books.

350
00:23:20,091 --> 00:23:23,302
You sure about this, Jim? I mean, why
don't I go upstairs and talk to Deke?

351
00:23:23,386 --> 00:23:26,055
I'm sure we can work this out.

352
00:23:27,598 --> 00:23:30,560
This was my call.

353
00:23:40,092 --> 00:23:42,344
Must've been a tough one.

354
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:50,288
Look, I don't have the measles.

355
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:54,083
I'm not gonna get the measles.

356
00:23:57,964 --> 00:24:00,757
Shit. Ken, wait up.

357
00:24:04,184 --> 00:24:08,271
Trajectory is holding steady.
We're right on the line.

358
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:13,810
Okay. We're into program 64. We're in 5G,
so we're feeling that gravity now.

359
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:17,940
Houston, we are at 400,000 feet
passing entry interphase.

360
00:24:17,982 --> 00:24:19,942
<i>About to lose signal.</i>

361
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:24,614
<i>Re-entry data is nominal,
and we have radio blackout.</i>

362
00:24:28,089 --> 00:24:30,328
What's the story here?

363
00:24:30,411 --> 00:24:34,415
I got a corridor light.
We're comin' in too shallow.

364
00:24:34,457 --> 00:24:37,293
I'm goin' manual.

365
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,633
- Houston, switching to SCS.
- Roger, Thirteen.

366
00:24:43,674 --> 00:24:46,469
Okay, we're at three Gs.

367
00:24:46,511 --> 00:24:49,472
Five Gs.

368
00:24:49,514 --> 00:24:51,474
We're comin' in too steep.

369
00:24:51,516 --> 00:24:55,269
I'm gonna stay in this roll,
see if I can pull us out.

370
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:57,563
We're at eight Gs.

371
00:24:57,647 --> 00:25:00,233
Nine. Ten.

372
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,488
- We're at 12 Gs.
- Twelve Gs. We're burnin' up.

373
00:25:07,748 --> 00:25:09,117
Damn it!

374
00:25:09,437 --> 00:25:12,285
I gave 'em a false indicator light
right at entry interphase.

375
00:25:12,328 --> 00:25:14,330
Even Mattingly didn't
get it the first time.

376
00:25:14,372 --> 00:25:16,499
How ya feelin', Freddo?

377
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:19,001
Char-broiled.

378
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,507
So what happened?

379
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,427
Came in too steep. We're dead.

380
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:33,141
- No shit.
- Yeah, we were into program 67 there.

381
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:38,813
Okay, guys, we're gonna
do this again, obviously, but...

382
00:25:38,855 --> 00:25:41,482
<i>give us a minute
to get our switches reset.</i>

383
00:25:41,524 --> 00:25:43,526
Jim, could we have a word?

384
00:25:45,695 --> 00:25:47,697
Oh, sure, Deke.

385
00:25:53,745 --> 00:25:57,290
<i>We're going to drop off line
and debrief this one on our own.</i>

386
00:25:58,416 --> 00:26:01,002
- So?
- Well...

387
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,550
If I had a dollar for every time
they killed me in this thing...

388
00:26:04,566 --> 00:26:07,842
I wouldn't have
to work for you, Deke.

389
00:26:12,889 --> 00:26:15,683
Well, we have two days.
We'll be ready.

390
00:26:15,725 --> 00:26:17,769
Let's do it again.

391
00:26:19,684 --> 00:26:20,980
Do it again.

392
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:33,501
Margaret, get them!
Fred, Stephen, come here!

393
00:26:33,576 --> 00:26:35,995
- Daddy!
- Watch out! You'll fall!

394
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:38,605
We can't go across that road.

395
00:26:38,675 --> 00:26:42,502
We don't want Daddy to get our germs
and get sick in outer space, right?

396
00:26:42,585 --> 00:26:46,506
Hey, boys. Not givin' your mom
a hard time, are ya?

397
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:49,092
Princess, you look beautiful.

398
00:26:51,636 --> 00:26:53,596
Jack!

399
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:13,533
Well, hey, that looks
like Marilyn Lovell.

400
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:16,619
But it can't be.
She's not coming to the launch.

401
00:27:16,858 --> 00:27:18,621
I heard it was gonna be
a hell of a show.

402
00:27:19,045 --> 00:27:20,373
Who told you that?

403
00:27:20,456 --> 00:27:22,959
Some guy I know.

404
00:27:26,115 --> 00:27:28,075
You can't live without me.

405
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:31,843
Okay, folks.
Let's say good night.

406
00:27:31,926 --> 00:27:34,137
- We got a big day tomorrow for these guys.
- Good night!

407
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,056
You hear about Ken?

408
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,059
Yeah.

409
00:27:55,326 --> 00:27:57,994
One, two.

410
00:27:58,035 --> 00:28:00,204
Stand back, please.

411
00:28:03,194 --> 00:28:04,751
Ah, Guenter Wendt.

412
00:28:05,366 --> 00:28:07,128
I wonder where Guenter went?

413
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,338
Jim.

414
00:28:11,424 --> 00:28:15,428
- You walk on ze moon, ja?
- Ja. Ja, we walk and...

415
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:18,222
and we talk on ze moon.

416
00:28:25,855 --> 00:28:28,191
How do you feel? Pretty good?

417
00:28:28,232 --> 00:28:31,819
Good. Might be a little
warmer in here, huh?

418
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:35,531
- How are you today? Ready?
- Good. Yeah.

419
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,512
Oh! Oh! Jeez! Oh!

420
00:29:00,838 --> 00:29:03,976
Oh, God, no!

421
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:10,024
Oh, no.

422
00:29:14,528 --> 00:29:17,146
- Okay, we have the oxygen burn system?
- Check.

423
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,267
- We have the helmet restraint ring?
- Check.

424
00:29:30,878 --> 00:29:33,256
Communication umbilical on.

425
00:29:34,143 --> 00:29:35,112
- Fred.
- What?

426
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:37,510
- Gum.
- Aw, sorry.

427
00:29:39,262 --> 00:29:41,222
Thanks.

428
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:45,680
I'm gonna give these guys
a beautiful ride.

429
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,189
Sure you will, Jack.

430
00:30:00,992 --> 00:30:03,077
You need more air?

431
00:30:18,843 --> 00:30:21,137
You want some apple?

432
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,139
- Marilyn, hey!
- Mary.

433
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:25,475
Aw, I hate this already.

434
00:30:25,516 --> 00:30:27,428
You're not just about to pop,
are you?

435
00:30:27,467 --> 00:30:31,606
No. I got 30 days
'til this blast-off.

436
00:31:15,576 --> 00:31:17,536
This is for Gene.

437
00:31:20,563 --> 00:31:23,616
Mrs. Kranz has pulled out
the old needle and thread again.

438
00:31:23,699 --> 00:31:26,035
The last one looked like
he bought it off a gypsy.

439
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:28,579
Well, you can't argue with tradition.

440
00:31:28,663 --> 00:31:30,581
Copy that.

441
00:31:30,665 --> 00:31:32,667
This is from your wife, Gene.

442
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:34,669
Thank you, Tom.

443
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,838
I was startin' to get worried.

444
00:31:38,047 --> 00:31:40,007
There we go.

445
00:31:41,197 --> 00:31:44,262
- I like it. I like that one, Gene.
- Sharp, Gene.

446
00:31:57,984 --> 00:32:00,403
Jim, you're all set.

447
00:32:09,787 --> 00:32:11,873
Very sharp.

448
00:32:11,914 --> 00:32:14,250
Hey, Gene, I guess we can go now.

449
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:16,919
Save it for splashdown, guys.

450
00:32:35,813 --> 00:32:39,609
Apollo 13 flight controllers,
listen up.

451
00:32:40,086 --> 00:32:42,236
Give me a go, no go for launch.

452
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:43,630

Launch Control, this is Houston.
We are go for launch.

468
00:33:07,845 --> 00:33:10,640
Roger that, Houston.

469
00:33:11,285 --> 00:33:12,707
Pad leader, what's your status?

470
00:33:12,918 --> 00:33:14,996
<i>We are go for launch.</i>

471
00:33:15,061 --> 00:33:17,564
<i>T minus 60 seconds and counting.</i>

472
00:33:42,394 --> 00:33:45,091
- Stand by.
- Roger.

473
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,527
Fuel pumps.

474
00:34:04,569 --> 00:34:08,030
This is it. A few bumps
and we're haulin' the mail.

475
00:34:14,284 --> 00:34:17,999
<i>Control, this is Guidance.
We're ready for take-off.</i>

476
00:34:20,209 --> 00:34:22,044
We are go for launch.

<i>We have lift-off!</i>

486
00:35:30,613 --> 00:35:35,618
<i>Houston, we have cleared
the tower at 13:13.</i>

487
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:37,787
Okay, guys, we got it.

488
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,553
Come on, baby. Come on.

489
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:59,976
Altitude is on the line.

490
00:36:00,351 --> 00:36:02,812
Velocity right on the line.

491
00:36:04,147 --> 00:36:06,274
Roll complete. We are pitching.

492
00:36:06,315 --> 00:36:10,486
<i>Thirteen, stand by
for mode one Bravo.</i>

493
00:36:15,016 --> 00:36:17,034
FIDO, how we lookin'?

494
00:36:17,117 --> 00:36:19,828
Looks good, Flight.
Right down the middle.

495
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:24,917
<i>We see your BPC
Is clear, Thirteen.</i>

496
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:27,336
Roger. EDS to manual.

497
00:36:28,818 --> 00:36:30,173
Inboard.

498
00:36:30,256 --> 00:36:33,468
Get ready for a little jolt, fellas.

499
00:36:46,421 --> 00:36:49,484
That was some little jolt.

500
00:36:54,113 --> 00:36:56,199
Tower jett.

501
00:37:05,403 --> 00:37:09,212
Houston, this is Thirteen. We've got a
centre engine cut-off. Go on the other four.

502
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:15,308
Roger that, Thirteen.
We show the same.

503
00:37:15,363 --> 00:37:17,590
Booster, can you confirm
that centre engine cut-off?

504
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:21,057
- Roger that, Flight. Looks like we lost it.
- FIDO, what's that going to do to us?

505
00:37:21,379 --> 00:37:22,558
Stand by, Flight.

506
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,353
I need to know if the IU's correcting
for the number 5 shutdown.

507
00:37:35,071 --> 00:37:37,573
Houston, what's the story
on engine five?

508
00:37:39,909 --> 00:37:43,913
Looks good. We're still go. We'll be all right
as long as we don't lose another one.

509
00:37:44,308 --> 00:37:47,644
- Roger that.
- Thirteen, we're not sure why the inboard was out early...

510
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:51,087
but the other engines are go, so we're
just gonna burn those remaining engines...

511
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,980
for a little bit longer.

512
00:37:53,074 --> 00:37:55,925
<i>Roger that.</i>
Our gimbals are good.

513
00:37:55,967 --> 00:37:58,720
Our trim is good.

514
00:38:01,192 --> 00:38:03,558
Looks like we just had
our glitch for this mission.

515
00:38:13,768 --> 00:38:17,029
<i>- 13, stand by for staging.</i>
- Roger that.

516
00:38:17,402 --> 00:38:21,242
<i>S-2 shutdown. S-4B ignition.</i>

517
00:38:21,284 --> 00:38:23,619
<i>Thrust looks good, Flight.</i>

518
00:38:25,121 --> 00:38:27,415
Flight, S-4B cut-off
in ten seconds.

519
00:38:27,457 --> 00:38:31,836
Thirteen, this is Houston.
Predicted cut-off is 12 plus 34, over.

520
00:38:32,247 --> 00:38:36,716
Coming up on 12 minutes 34.

521
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,762
- And...
- SECO!

522
00:38:42,076 --> 00:38:43,431
<i>Shutdown.</i>

523
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,852
<i>And that, gentlemen,
is how we do that.</i>

524
00:39:13,169 --> 00:39:15,671
Oh, boy. Hope I can sleep.

525
00:39:15,713 --> 00:39:17,799
Mom, that was loud.

526
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,510
Here, hold my hand.

527
00:39:20,593 --> 00:39:23,262
I can't believe
you did this four times.

528
00:39:23,346 --> 00:39:24,764
The worst part's over.

529
00:39:24,847 --> 00:39:26,430
It is?

530
00:39:26,828 --> 00:39:31,896
Listen, this doesn't stop for me
until he lands on that aircraft carrier.

531
00:39:31,979 --> 00:39:34,107
Well, you just look
so calm about it.

532
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:38,486
If the flight surgeon had to okay me
for this mission, I'd be grounded.

533
00:39:38,528 --> 00:39:41,364
Mrs. Lovell! Mrs. Haise!
Can we speak to you?

534
00:39:41,406 --> 00:39:43,616
Can we just have
a word with you, Ma'am?

535
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:46,160
Remember, you're proud,
happy and thrilled.

536
00:39:46,202 --> 00:39:47,662
Mrs. Lovell!

537
00:39:47,703 --> 00:39:50,498
- How're ya feeling?
- Well, very proud...

538
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,834
and very happy,
and we're thrilled.

539
00:39:56,738 --> 00:39:59,507
<i>Flight, Booster.
I show S-4B shutdown.</i>

540
00:39:59,549 --> 00:40:02,552
TLI is on the money.
Looks good, Flight.

541
00:40:02,593 --> 00:40:05,054
Roger, FIDO.

542
00:40:05,752 --> 00:40:09,791
Okay, guys.
We're goin' to the moon.

543
00:40:09,837 --> 00:40:12,211
Flight, we have reacquisition
of signal at Hawaii.

544
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,813
- Flight, everything looks good.
- Can't ask for much better than that.

545
00:40:15,892 --> 00:40:17,734
Okay, Houston. CMP Here.

546
00:40:17,775 --> 00:40:21,070
I've exchanged couches with Jim.
I'm in the pilot's seat.

547
00:40:21,112 --> 00:40:25,908
I'm gonna go ahead and get set
for transposition and docking.

548
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:28,494
<i>Roger that, Jack.</i>

549
00:40:40,716 --> 00:40:42,425
Freddo, are you okay?

550
00:40:45,928 --> 00:40:49,223
<i>Okay, everybody, let's get turned around
and pick up the lunar module.</i>

551
00:40:49,482 --> 00:40:53,019
Odyssey, you're go for pyro arm
and docking. Repeat, go for docking,

552
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:56,272
and we recommend you secure
cabin pressurization.

553
00:40:56,911 --> 00:40:59,108
<i>Roger that.</i>

554
00:40:59,461 --> 00:41:04,029
Okay, we're ready
for CSM separation.

555
00:41:04,113 --> 00:41:08,370
Okay, SMRCS
Isol valves are all gray.

556
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:11,037
Okay, Swigert,
command module pilot...

557
00:41:11,299 --> 00:41:13,551
she's all yours.

558
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,754
<i>Houston, we've got
a good separation.</i>

559
00:41:19,796 --> 00:41:22,548
<i>- The S-4B is stable.
- Translation looks good.</i>

560
00:41:22,632 --> 00:41:26,135
<i>- We confirm that, Thirteen.
- Okay, we're gonna start to pitch around...</i>

561
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:28,137
<i>to line up with the LEM.</i>

562
00:41:28,221 --> 00:41:30,223
You know, Freddo, Frank Borman...

563
00:41:30,984 --> 00:41:33,266
was up chuckin' most of the way
to the moon on Apollo 8.

564
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:37,397
I'm all right. I just ate too much
breakfast. Let's go to work.

565
00:41:38,815 --> 00:41:40,817
And pitching up.

566
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,320
Pitch rate,
2.5 degrees per second.

567
00:41:44,362 --> 00:41:47,990
<i>Roger, Jack.</i>
We see you pitching around.

568
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,729
Keep an eye on that telemetry.

569
00:41:49,783 --> 00:41:54,163
Roger that. If Swigert can't dock
this thing, we don't have a mission.

570
00:41:55,498 --> 00:41:59,001
- How's the alignment?
- GDC align.

571
00:42:03,339 --> 00:42:06,634
Thrusting forward.

572
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,454
<i>One hundred feet.</i>

573
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,676
Watch the alignment, now.

574
00:42:24,143 --> 00:42:26,154
Ah, don't worry, guys.

575
00:42:26,195 --> 00:42:28,656
I'm on top of it.

576
00:42:32,013 --> 00:42:37,457
<i>- FIDO, let me know when you're ready.
- Okay, let's uplink that.</i>

577
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,543
- How we lookin', FIDO?
- We're not there yet. Forty feet.

578
00:42:42,807 --> 00:42:45,101
<i>Twenty.</i>

579
00:42:48,905 --> 00:42:51,240
Come on, rookie,
park that thing.

580
00:42:57,452 --> 00:42:59,287
Ten feet.

581
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:12,325
- Capture.
- That's it.

582
00:43:12,408 --> 00:43:15,828
- Talk back is barber pole.
- Go ahead and retract.

583
00:43:19,407 --> 00:43:21,555
Houston, we have hard dock.

584
00:43:21,602 --> 00:43:24,879
Roger, understand.
That's a good deal, Jack.

585
00:43:24,921 --> 00:43:27,507
Let's start back up with procedure 17.

586
00:43:28,467 --> 00:43:31,177
<i>Okay, Houston, we have LEM extraction.</i>

587
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,262
<i>We copy that, Thirteen.</i>

588
00:43:33,304 --> 00:43:35,556
<i>Now you're off
to the Fra Mauro highlands.</i>

589
00:43:35,597 --> 00:43:39,120
- I gotta get out of this suit.
- Houston, we are ready...

590
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,687
for the beginning
of the PTC...

591
00:43:41,771 --> 00:43:46,109
and I think once we're in that
barbecue roll, uh, Jack and I will eat.

592
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,736
- Hey, I'm hungry.
- Are you sure?

593
00:43:48,778 --> 00:43:52,365
I could eat the ass
out of a dead rhinoceros.

594
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:58,378
- We got a smooth one, huh?
- By the numbers so far.

595
00:43:58,472 --> 00:44:03,459
We just ran a minimum load test on the
cooling system. Let me clean this up.

596
00:44:03,501 --> 00:44:05,628
- See you tomorrow.
- Take care.

597
00:44:20,433 --> 00:44:23,012
It's too bad we can't
demonstrate this on TV.

598
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:26,154
What a shame.

599
00:44:30,986 --> 00:44:34,156
Okay. Overboard dump comin' up.

600
00:44:37,767 --> 00:44:39,454
Here it comes...

601
00:44:39,495 --> 00:44:41,497
the constellation Urion.

602
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,670
<i>Now, that's a beautiful sight.</i>

603
00:44:47,712 --> 00:44:51,247
Barbara. Barbara, we are going
to your father's broadcast.

604
00:44:51,309 --> 00:44:54,343
No! I'm never coming out!

605
00:44:54,385 --> 00:44:58,556
I hate Paul! No one else
can ever play their records again!

606
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:02,018
She's still going on about
the stupid Beatles breaking up?

607
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,645
- They're not stupid! You're stupid!
- Barbara!

608
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:05,653
I know you're in mourning.

609
00:45:05,731 --> 00:45:08,560
I'm not going, Mom!
Dad won't know if we're there!

610
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:13,528

622
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:50,525

00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,444
All the networks dumped us.

631
00:46:34,485 --> 00:46:39,407
One of them said we made goin' to the moon
about as exciting as a trip to Pittsburgh.

632
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:42,994
My son's supposed to be on.

633
00:46:43,077 --> 00:46:45,621
He's in outer space.

Well, folks, let's head on down
to the lunar excursion module.

649
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,761
Follow me.

650
00:47:41,844 --> 00:47:44,242

651
00:47:44,297 --> 00:47:48,250
Fred Haise and I will float

652
00:47:48,289 --> 00:47:50,603

653
00:47:50,684 --> 00:47:53,405
EECOM, that stir's gonna be...

00:47:57,527 --> 00:47:59,695
...the spacecraft

656
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:04,364
Well, folks, as you can
probably tell...

657
00:48:04,434 --> 00:48:08,021
the Aquarius isn't much bigger
than a couple of telephone booths.

658
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:12,875
The skin of the LEM in
some places is only as...

659
00:48:12,917 --> 00:48:15,503
as thick as a couple of layers...

660
00:48:15,545 --> 00:48:19,048
of tinfoil, and that's all that
protects us from the vacuum of space.

661
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:24,053
We get away with this because the LEM is

662
00:48:24,137 --> 00:48:28,224
Fred Haise, Renaissance man.

663
00:48:28,266 --> 00:48:32,979
Okay, we'll head back up the tunnel now
and back into the Odyssey.

664
00:48:34,564 --> 00:48:38,567
<i>♪ When you and your baby
Have a fallin' out ♪</i>

665
00:48:38,629 --> 00:48:41,820
All right, we've returned to the command...

666
00:48:42,403 --> 00:48:44,700
Stand by one, Houston.

667
00:48:44,825 --> 00:48:47,368
Gotcha!

668
00:48:47,408 --> 00:48:51,176
Houston, that bang you heard was
Fred Haise on the cabin repress valve.

669
00:48:51,247 --> 00:48:53,770
He gets our hearts goin'
every time with that one.

670
00:48:53,823 --> 00:48:56,702
<i>♪ We'll go honky tonkin'
'Round this town ♪</i>

671
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:01,799
Okay, we're, uh, about
to close out the Aquarius...

672
00:49:01,883 --> 00:49:04,447
and, uh, return to the Odyssey.

673
00:49:04,469 --> 00:49:09,598
Our next broadcast will be from
Fra Mauro on the surface of the moon.

674
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,900
<i>So, uh, this is the crew

675
00:49:14,963 --> 00:49:18,524

676
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:20,902

All right.

678
00:49:28,451 --> 00:49:30,453
Daddy was funny.

679
00:49:30,495 --> 00:49:32,955
They might air a few minutes
of it on the news tonight.

680
00:49:32,997 --> 00:49:36,042
You'd think so.

681
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:38,252
- Bye.
- Bye.

682
00:49:38,544 --> 00:49:42,757
Well, between Jack's back taxes
and the Fred Haise Show...

683
00:49:43,328 --> 00:49:46,260
I'd say that was a pretty
successful broadcast.

684
00:49:46,344 --> 00:49:49,931
<i>- That was an excellent show, Odyssey.</i>
- Thank you very much, Houston.

685
00:49:50,013 --> 00:49:52,265
We've got a couple of
housekeeping procedures for you.

686
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:57,105
We'd like you to roll right
to 0-6-0 and null your rates.

687
00:49:57,188 --> 00:50:01,025
Roger that.
Rolling right, 0-6-0.

688
00:50:05,113 --> 00:50:08,991
And then if you could give
your oxygen tanks a stir.

689
00:50:09,848 --> 00:50:10,910
Roger that.

690
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:47,396
Hey, we've got a problem here.

691
00:50:47,447 --> 00:50:50,116
- What did you do?
- Nothing. I stirred the tanks.

692
00:50:50,158 --> 00:50:52,660
- Whoa!
- Hey!

693
00:50:55,774 --> 00:50:58,624
Uh, this is Houston.
Say again please.

694
00:50:58,708 --> 00:51:03,796
Houston, we have a problem.
We have a main bus B undervolt.

695
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:07,133
- We've got a lot of thruster activity here, Houston.
- What's with the computer now?

696
00:51:07,175 --> 00:51:11,345
It just went off line.
There's another master alarm, Houston.

697
00:51:11,429 --> 00:51:13,163
- I'm checking the quad.
- That was no repress valve.

698
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:16,309
- Maybe it's in quad C. I'm gonna reconfigure the RCS.
- We've got a computer restart.

699
00:51:16,392 --> 00:51:18,519
- We've got a ping light.
- The way these are firing doesn't make sense.

700
00:51:18,603 --> 00:51:22,148
We've got multiple caution and warning,
Houston. We've got to reset and restart.

701
00:51:22,231 --> 00:51:24,525
Alright, I'm going to SCS.

702
00:51:26,527 --> 00:51:29,489
Jesus. Flight, their
heart rates are skyrocketing.

703
00:51:29,572 --> 00:51:33,242
- EECOM, what's your data telling you?
- O2 tank two not reading at all.

704
00:51:33,326 --> 00:51:36,954
Tank one is at 725 psi
and falling.

705
00:51:36,996 --> 00:51:40,583
Fuel cells one and three
are, uh...

706
00:51:40,666 --> 00:51:43,294
Oh, boy, what's going on here?
Flight, let me get back to you.

707
00:51:43,336 --> 00:51:46,422
Flight, GNC.
Flight, They're all over the place.t

708
00:51:46,506 --> 00:51:49,267
- They keep yawing close to gimbal lock.
- I keep losing radio signal.

709
00:51:49,342 --> 00:51:51,260
Flight, their antennae
must be flipped around.

710
00:51:51,343 --> 00:51:53,398
- They're gonna have to do it manually if they do it at all.
- One at a time, people.

711
00:51:53,475 --> 00:51:55,263
One at a time. One at a time.

712
00:51:55,348 --> 00:51:59,352
EECOM, is this an instrumentation problem
or are we looking at real power loss here?

713
00:51:59,435 --> 00:52:01,854
It's reading a quadruple failure.
That can't happen.

714
00:52:01,896 --> 00:52:03,856
It's got to be instrumentation.

715
00:52:03,898 --> 00:52:06,734
Let's get the hatch buttoned.
The LEM might have been hit by a meteor.

716
00:52:06,818 --> 00:52:09,779
The tunnel's really torquin'
with all this movement.

717
00:52:10,596 --> 00:52:13,862
Houston, we had a pretty large bang
there associated with a master alarm.

718
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:15,952
Shit, it's main bus A.

719
00:52:16,035 --> 00:52:20,957
<i>- Main bus A undervolt?</i>
- Houston, we have a main bus A undervolt down to...

720
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,919
It's reading 25 and a half.
Main bus B is reading zip right now.

721
00:52:25,002 --> 00:52:27,171
We got a wicked shimmy up here.

722
00:52:27,509 --> 00:52:30,220
EECOM, GNC, these guys are talking
about bangs and shimmies up there.

723
00:52:30,283 --> 00:52:31,926
Doesn't sound like instrumentation to me.

724
00:52:32,009 --> 00:52:34,721
<i>- You are breaking up, 13.</i>
- Can't get this hatch to seal.

725
00:52:34,804 --> 00:52:39,225
Just stow it. If we'd been hit
by a meteor, we'd be dead by now.

726
00:52:39,877 --> 00:52:41,351
I'm gonna try to get us
out of this lurch.

727
00:52:41,394 --> 00:52:44,063
Houston you're in the mud. Did you say
switch to omni Bravo?

728
00:52:44,147 --> 00:52:47,238
<i>- Roger that, Thirteen.</i>
- Roger, and the signal strength on the high gain went way down.

729
00:52:47,293 --> 00:52:50,403
It's fighting me. What's the story here, Jack?
We keep flirting with gimbal lock.

730
00:52:50,804 --> 00:52:55,408
<i>Odyssey, we need a confirmation.
What systems do you have down?</i>

731
00:52:55,926 --> 00:52:58,578
- I'm having a hard time, Rick.
- Okay Jim. SMRCS Helium one.

732
00:52:58,661 --> 00:53:01,539
- Did you say switch to omni Charlie?
- A and C are barber pole.

733
00:53:01,581 --> 00:53:04,459
Houston, I'm switching over
quad C to main A.

734
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:05,658
<i>Roger that, Thirteen.</i>

735
00:53:05,768 --> 00:53:09,255
Okay, Houston, fuel cell one,
fuel cell three.

736
00:53:09,296 --> 00:53:13,821
We got a main bus B undervolt,
cryo pressure, suit compressor.

737
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:18,598
What don't we have?
AC bus one, AC bus two...

738
00:53:18,681 --> 00:53:21,934
command module computer
<i>and O2 flow high.</i>

739
00:53:22,018 --> 00:53:24,604
I don't know. Maybe this is
a caution and warning failure.

740
00:53:24,687 --> 00:53:29,817
Houston, we are venting
something out into space.

741
00:53:30,682 --> 00:53:35,406
<i>I can see it outside
of window one right now.</i>

742
00:53:35,721 --> 00:53:40,369
<i>It's definitely, uh...
a gas of some sort.</i>

743
00:53:42,413 --> 00:53:45,416
It's got to be the oxygen.

744
00:54:02,737 --> 00:54:04,803
Roger, Odyssey.
We copy your venting.

745
00:54:04,847 --> 00:54:08,481
- Give me an alignment.
<i>- Okay. Let's think about the kind of things we can connect.</i>

746
00:54:08,564 --> 00:54:11,359
- Let's start back at the beginning.
- Anything look abnormal?

747
00:54:23,037 --> 00:54:26,040
Okay, listen up. Quiet down, people.

748
00:54:28,153 --> 00:54:32,046
Quiet down. Quiet down.
Let's stay cool, people.

749
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:35,216
Procedures, I need another
computer up in the RTCC.

750
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:38,052
I want everybody to alert
your support teams.

751
00:54:38,136 --> 00:54:40,888
Wake up anybody you need
and get them in here.

752
00:54:40,972 --> 00:54:43,224
Let's work the problem, people.

753
00:54:43,307 --> 00:54:45,648
Let's not make things worse
by guessin'.

754
00:54:45,695 --> 00:54:50,064
<i>Thirteen, this is Houston. We are going around
the room. We're gonna get you answers.</i>

755
00:54:50,148 --> 00:54:53,901
<i>I tell you, we keep venting like this, we're
gonna keep hitting the edge of that dead band.</i>

756
00:54:53,985 --> 00:54:56,320
Take a look at the O2
on number one.

757
00:55:01,033 --> 00:55:04,036
200 pounds and falling.

758
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,247
O2 tank two still zero.

759
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:09,917
- Tank one: 218 psi and falling.
<i>- Is that what you're gettin'? Confirm.</i>

760
00:55:10,001 --> 00:55:14,422
<i>- We're seeing the same, Thirteen.</i>
- Can we review our status, Sy?

761
00:55:14,505 --> 00:55:19,177
Let's look at this thing
from a standpoint of status.

762
00:55:23,144 --> 00:55:25,558
What have we got
on the spacecraft that's good?

763
00:55:28,777 --> 00:55:30,396
I'll get back to you, Gene.

764
00:55:32,523 --> 00:55:34,901
We're not gonna have
power much longer.

765
00:55:35,335 --> 00:55:38,279
The ship's bleedin' to death.

766
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,914
- Flight?
<i>- Yeah. Go, EECOM.</i>

767
00:55:48,181 --> 00:55:52,043
Um, Flight, I recommend we shut down
the reactant valves of the fuel cells.

768
00:55:53,495 --> 00:55:56,435
What the hell good
is that gonna do?

769
00:55:56,474 --> 00:55:58,925
If that's where the leak is,
we can isolate it.

770
00:55:59,115 --> 00:56:02,466
We can isolate it there, and we can save what's left in
the tanks, and we can run on the good cell.

771
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:04,076
You close 'em,
you can't open 'em again.

772
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:06,711
You can't land on the moon
with one healthy fuel cell.

773
00:56:07,959 --> 00:56:10,603
Gene, the Odyssey is dying.

774
00:56:11,121 --> 00:56:13,957
From my chair here,
this is the last option.

775
00:56:21,489 --> 00:56:25,118
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, Sy.

776
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:41,509
CAPCOM, let's have them
close the reactant valves.

777
00:56:42,841 --> 00:56:44,554
Thirteen, this is Houston.

778
00:56:44,926 --> 00:56:50,136
We want you to close react valves
on cells one and three. Do you copy?

779
00:56:52,152 --> 00:56:54,564
Are you saying you want
the whole smash?

780
00:56:54,647 --> 00:56:58,735
Closing down the react valves
for fuel cells shut down?

781
00:56:58,818 --> 00:57:02,488
Shutting down the fuel cells?
Did I hear you right?

782
00:57:03,001 --> 00:57:05,408
Yeah, they heard me right.

783
00:57:05,986 --> 00:57:09,203
Tell them we think that's
the only way they can stop the leak.

784
00:57:09,607 --> 00:57:13,916
Yeah, Jim. <i>We think that closing
the react valves may stop the leak.</i>

785
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,430
- Did he copy that?
- Do you copy, Jim?

786
00:57:29,415 --> 00:57:31,231
Yes, Houston, we copy.

787
00:57:36,965 --> 00:57:39,215
We just lost the moon.

788
00:57:48,448 --> 00:57:50,453
Okay, Freddo, shut those down.

789
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,373
Let's see what this does.

790
00:58:03,324 --> 00:58:05,218
If this doesn't work...

791
00:58:05,301 --> 00:58:08,096
we're not gonna have enough
power left to get home.

792
00:58:26,114 --> 00:58:28,741
- Shit!
- Goddamn it!

793
00:58:28,783 --> 00:58:32,036
Houston, O2 on one is still falling.

794
00:58:35,288 --> 00:58:37,375
Freddo, how long does it take
to power up the LEM?

795
00:58:37,417 --> 00:58:39,585
Three hours by the checklist.

796
00:58:40,452 --> 00:58:42,138
We don't have that much time.

797
00:58:42,213 --> 00:58:44,257
Shit!

798
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:49,387
Okay, now, Jack, before the batteries
completely die on us in here...

799
00:58:49,429 --> 00:58:54,392
let's power down everything so we can
save as much as we can for re-entry.

800
00:58:54,434 --> 00:58:58,062
Fifteen minutes of oxygen and that's it.
The command module will be dead.

801
00:58:58,104 --> 00:59:01,232
Okay. Okay, guys, listen up.
Here's the drill.

802
00:59:01,274 --> 00:59:03,447
We're moving the astronauts
over to the LEM.

803
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:05,229
We've got to get some oxygen up there.

804
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:09,240
TELMU, Control, I want an emergency power
procedure; the essential hardware only.

805
00:59:09,626 --> 00:59:13,502
GNC, EECOM, we're gonna be shutting down
the command module at the same time.

806
00:59:13,533 --> 00:59:16,247
We'll have to transfer the guidance
system from one computer to the other...

807
00:59:16,289 --> 00:59:19,167
so I want those numbers up and ready
when our guys are in position.

808
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:22,187
We've gotta transfer all control
data over the LEM computer...

809
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:23,588
before the command module dies.

810
00:59:23,629 --> 00:59:25,631
The lunar module
just became a lifeboat.

811
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:30,094
Odyssey, this is Houston.
We need you to power down immediately.

812
00:59:30,136 --> 00:59:34,073
<i>You're gonna have to power up the LEM at the same
time, so you better get somebody over there.</i>

813
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:36,434
We already have Freddo
in the LEM, Houston.

814
00:59:36,476 --> 00:59:38,936
<i>We've got serious time pressure here, Jim.</i>

815
00:59:38,978 --> 00:59:41,439
<i>You've got to get
the guidance program transferred,</i>

816
00:59:41,481 --> 00:59:44,108
<i>and you've got to do it before you're
out of power in the command module...</i>

817
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:46,611
<i>or you're not gonna be able
to navigate up there.</i>

818
00:59:46,652 --> 00:59:48,654
How much time?
Can you give me a number?

819
00:59:48,738 --> 00:59:52,825
Well, we're looking at less than 15
minutes of life support in the Odyssey.

820
00:59:56,703 --> 01:00:00,792
We've got 15 minutes, Freddo.
It's worse than I thought.

821
01:00:02,114 --> 01:00:04,879
<i>Houston, be aware I've moved
from the command module into the LEM.</i>

822
01:00:06,964 --> 01:00:10,468
Now if Jack can't get that guidance computer
data transferred before they go dead...

823
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:12,970
- They won't even know which way they're pointed.
- That's right.

824
01:00:13,012 --> 01:00:15,723
- That's a bad way to fly.
- I'll be in 210 if you need me.

825
01:00:17,809 --> 01:00:21,687
<i>Houston, this is Thirteen.
Are you back with me now?</i>

826
01:00:22,635 --> 01:00:26,484
<i>Aquarius, this is Houston. You now have
about 12 minutes to power up.</i>

827
01:00:26,526 --> 01:00:30,738
I can't see any stars. Man, there's a
lot of debris floatin' around out there.

828
01:00:32,282 --> 01:00:34,909
Okay, Houston, I have completed
the steps on page 15.

829
01:00:34,992 --> 01:00:36,911
Now I'm ready
to power down the computer.

830
01:00:36,994 --> 01:00:40,373
I'm gonna need
your gimbal angles, Jack...

831
01:00:40,456 --> 01:00:44,711
- before you shut down the computer!
- Okay, Jim.

832
01:00:44,751 --> 01:00:46,574
I need this back to me
before they power down.

833
01:00:46,613 --> 01:00:49,136
All right, all right.
I've got it. I've got it. Hold on.

834
01:00:49,954 --> 01:00:53,928
- Houston, our computer is up.
<i>- Roger that. Stand by.</i>

835
01:00:54,542 --> 01:00:58,599
<i>Now Jack, we need to proceed with
steps 12 through 17 quickly.</i>

836
01:00:58,683 --> 01:01:02,628
<i>You're down to about
eight minutes remaining.</i>

837
01:01:02,674 --> 01:01:05,605
Fuel cell pump's off.
O2 fans, tank two off.

838
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:09,610
Okay, Houston, check me. I have
completed these gimbal conversions...

839
01:01:09,694 --> 01:01:13,281
but I need a double check
of the arithmetic.

840
01:01:13,364 --> 01:01:17,744
- Yeah, you can go, Jim.
- The roll CAL angle is minus two.

841
01:01:17,785 --> 01:01:21,289
<i>Lunar module roll is 355.57.</i>

842
01:01:21,372 --> 01:01:28,184
<i>Pitch: 1678... Correction.
Pitch: 167.78.</i>

843
01:01:28,246 --> 01:01:32,104
<i>- Yaw is 351.87.</i>
- Stand by. We're checking it.

844
01:01:32,151 --> 01:01:34,761
<i>We've got negative visibility
in our star field,</i>

845
01:01:34,802 --> 01:01:39,932
<i>and if this paperwork isn't right,
who knows where we'll end up out here?</i>

846
01:01:46,147 --> 01:01:48,107
Looks good, Flight.

847
01:01:48,149 --> 01:01:50,234
- It's all right.
- Good here.

848
01:01:50,276 --> 01:01:52,737
- He's good, Andy.
- We'll go on those numbers.

849
01:01:52,778 --> 01:01:54,246
<i>- You're good.</i>
- Log them in, Freddo.

850
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,949
<i>Jack, turn off the IMU.
Switch to SCS.</i>

851
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:59,465
<i>Stand by to turn off
the thrusters. Over.</i>

852
01:01:59,855 --> 01:02:03,471
<i>It's a great day in New York, isn't it?
It's girl watchers' weather.</i>

853
01:02:03,539 --> 01:02:06,125
<i>I like those ingenious girl watchers
who put on Con Edison helmets...</i>

854
01:02:06,167 --> 01:02:09,828
<i>and dig trenches in the street
to get a better view.</i>

855
01:02:09,898 --> 01:02:12,632
<i>But I... Hey, speaking
of girl watching,</i>

856
01:02:12,672 --> 01:02:16,104
<i>did you know that our first bachelor
astronaut is on his way to the moon?</i>

857
01:02:16,167 --> 01:02:18,805
<i>Is it Swigert?
Yeah, first bachelor.</i>

858
01:02:18,846 --> 01:02:22,964
<i>He's the kind, they say, has a girl
in every port. He has that reputation.</i>

859
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:27,563
<i>I think he's sort of foolishly optimistic,
taking nylons and Hershey bars to the moon.</i>

860
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,318
<i>Did you read
that three million...</i>

861
01:02:32,402 --> 01:02:34,753
<i>What do you say?
Less viewers or fewer viewers?</i>

862
01:02:34,831 --> 01:02:40,743
<i>Three million fewer viewers... Three million fewer
viewers watched the space shot than did the last one.</i>

863
01:02:40,827 --> 01:02:43,579
<i>Uh, I...
Colonel Borman is here...</i>

864
01:02:43,663 --> 01:02:46,165
<i>An ABC New...</i>

865
01:02:46,249 --> 01:02:49,919
<i>Here is ABC science editor
Jules Bergman.</i>

866
01:02:50,002 --> 01:02:53,589
<i>The Apollo 13 spacecraft
has lost all electrical power,</i>

867
01:02:53,673 --> 01:02:56,259
<i>and astronauts Jim Lovell,
Fred Haise and Jack Swigert...</i>

868
01:02:56,342 --> 01:02:58,803
<i>are making their way through
the tunnel to the lunar module,</i>

869
01:02:58,845 --> 01:03:00,430
<i>using it as a lifeboat,</i>

870
01:03:00,513 --> 01:03:03,599
<i>so they'll have electrical power
for their radios on the command module.</i>

871
01:03:03,682 --> 01:03:06,977
<i>Apollo 13 is apparently
also losing breathing oxygen...</i>

872
01:03:07,019 --> 01:03:10,148
Slow down. An electrical failure.
What exactly does that mean?

873
01:03:10,189 --> 01:03:13,192
<i>The emergency has ruled out
any chance of a lunar landing...</i>

874
01:03:13,276 --> 01:03:15,945
<i>and could endanger the lives
of the astronauts themselves...</i>

875
01:03:16,028 --> 01:03:20,116
<i>if the LEM oxygen supply, plus whatever
is left of the command module's oxygen,</i>

876
01:03:20,199 --> 01:03:22,694
<i>can't last them until
they can get back to Earth.</i>

877
01:03:22,756 --> 01:03:24,444
What do you mean there's
no immediate danger?

878
01:03:24,506 --> 01:03:27,498
I just heard they're losing oxygen.
Can they get back?

879
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:31,100
<i>The LEM's descent rocket engine
will be used in aborting the mission...</i>

880
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:33,546
<i>and getting the astronauts
safely back to Earth.</i>

881
01:03:33,629 --> 01:03:38,384
<i>Recapping what has happened now: The Apollo
13 astronauts may be in grave danger.</i>

882
01:03:38,426 --> 01:03:40,386
No, don't give me
that NASA bullshit!

883
01:03:40,428 --> 01:03:42,597
I want to know what's
happening with my husband!

884
01:03:42,658 --> 01:03:45,015
<i>We want to switch control
to the Aquarius now.</i>

885
01:03:45,058 --> 01:03:46,768
- Roger that.
- Houston, wait!

886
01:03:46,849 --> 01:03:50,006
<i>- You're down to about five minutes now, Jack.</i>
- Whoa, the R.C.S. isn't up yet.

887
01:03:50,085 --> 01:03:55,068
Houston, be aware our RCS <i>isn't up here yet.
We have no attitude control on Aquarius.</i>

888
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:58,404
They don't have control?
Did we miss a step here?

889
01:03:58,488 --> 01:04:01,407
- Control, what the hell happened?
- What? I don't know.

890
01:04:06,455 --> 01:04:10,375
<i>Okay. We're all out of whack.</i> I'm trying to pitch
down, but we're yawing to the left.

891
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:12,019
Why can't I null this out?

892
01:04:12,089 --> 01:04:15,254
<i>She wasn't designed to fly attached like this,
our centre of gravity with the Command Module.</i>

893
01:04:16,217 --> 01:04:19,133
It's like flying with
a dead elephant on our back.

894
01:04:19,217 --> 01:04:22,095
Flight, Guidance. We're getting
awfully close to centre here.

895
01:04:22,178 --> 01:04:25,162
Aquarius, watch that middle gimbal.
<i>We don't want you tumbling off into space.</i>

896
01:04:25,224 --> 01:04:28,726
Freddo, inform Houston I'm well aware
of the goddamn gimbals!

897
01:04:29,541 --> 01:04:30,770
Roger that, Houston.

898
01:04:30,812 --> 01:04:32,030
<i>I don't need to hear the obvious.</i>

899
01:04:32,093 --> 01:04:34,671
<i>- I've got the frappin' eight-ball in front of me!</i>
- Andy, we're on VOX.

900
01:04:34,897 --> 01:04:37,902
Aquarius, this is Houston.
We've got you both on VOX.

901
01:04:37,944 --> 01:04:40,488
<i>You want what?
You want us to go to VOX, Andy?</i>

902
01:04:40,571 --> 01:04:43,658
<i>You have a hot mike.
We are reading everything you say.</i>

903
01:04:43,741 --> 01:04:45,660
Sorry, Jim.

904
01:04:47,247 --> 01:04:49,247
<i>It's only
by a very narrow margin...</i>

905
01:04:49,288 --> 01:04:53,459
<i>that we're going to get Lovell,
Haise and Swigert back alive.</i>

906
01:04:53,501 --> 01:04:56,254
Marilyn?

907
01:04:56,904 --> 01:04:59,173
I'm sorry.
Jeffrey's calling for you.

908
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:03,261
<i>...the terseness of Kraft and
the grim lines of Jim McDivitt.</i>

909
01:05:03,302 --> 01:05:08,015
<i>This has been a very close call and we're not
out of the woods yet. Not by a long shot.</i>

910
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,272
Jeffrey?

911
01:05:15,248 --> 01:05:17,692
Why are so many people here?

912
01:05:17,775 --> 01:05:23,614
Oh, well, you know...
your dad's flying his mission.

913
01:05:26,259 --> 01:05:28,786
He said he was going
to get me a moon rock.

914
01:05:28,828 --> 01:05:31,706
Right.

915
01:05:32,749 --> 01:05:35,209
Well...

916
01:05:36,601 --> 01:05:40,548
something broke
on your daddy's spaceship,

917
01:05:40,896 --> 01:05:46,220
and he's gonna have to turn around
before he even gets to the moon.

918
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,726
Was it the door?

919
01:05:52,766 --> 01:05:55,730
<i>Thirteen, Houston. We still show
that venting pushing you around.</i>

920
01:05:55,813 --> 01:05:58,858
<i>- How you doing?
- Houston, Aquarius.</i>

921
01:05:58,941 --> 01:06:03,863
We've had to learn how to fly all over
again, but we are doing better up here now.

922
01:06:03,905 --> 01:06:07,992
- Uh, roger that, Aquarius.
- Have him close it out.

923
01:06:08,034 --> 01:06:11,579
<i>Jack, we can close out
your procedure now.</i>

924
01:06:11,662 --> 01:06:16,751
Now, do we know for sure that we can
power this thing back up?

925
01:06:17,154 --> 01:06:19,670
<i>It's gonna get
awfully cold in here.</i>

926
01:06:20,138 --> 01:06:24,592
<i>Copy that, Jack.
We'll just have to deal with that later.</i>

927
01:06:27,470 --> 01:06:28,888
- Computer off.
- We're clear.

928
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:31,015
We're going to the LEM.

929
01:06:32,767 --> 01:06:36,729
We confirm shutdown, Jack.
<i>Lunar module now in control.</i>

930
01:06:41,882 --> 01:06:46,739
Roger that, Houston.
This is Odyssey signing off.

931
01:07:02,332 --> 01:07:05,082
Freddo, we're gonna have
to execute some sort of a burn here.

932
01:07:05,115 --> 01:07:07,659
It's just a matter of when.

933
01:07:11,431 --> 01:07:15,393
- Did they shut us all down in there?
- Yeah.

934
01:07:15,864 --> 01:07:18,813
Didn't think we'd
be back in here so soon.

935
01:07:20,325 --> 01:07:22,984
Houston, how far off course
do you project we are?

936
01:07:23,067 --> 01:07:24,986
Over.

937
01:07:27,447 --> 01:07:29,365
Okay, people, listen up!

938
01:07:29,449 --> 01:07:33,327
Gentlemen, I want you all
to forget the flight plan.

939
01:07:33,645 --> 01:07:37,373
From this moment on, we are
improvising a new mission.

940
01:07:40,059 --> 01:07:41,335
Sorry about that.

941
01:07:41,419 --> 01:07:43,504
- We'll get somebody to look at that.
- Find a bulb around here.

942
01:07:43,588 --> 01:07:47,383
How do we get our people home?

943
01:07:48,387 --> 01:07:49,715
They are here.

944
01:07:49,779 --> 01:07:51,888
- Do we turn 'em around, straight back, direct abort?
- Yes!

945
01:07:51,971 --> 01:07:53,931
- Gene...
- I can't guarantee the burn yet.

946
01:07:53,973 --> 01:07:57,226
No, sir, no, sir, no, sir!

947
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:59,395
We get them on
a free-return trajectory.

948
01:07:59,736 --> 01:08:02,023
It's the option with the fewest
question marks for safety.

949
01:08:02,105 --> 01:08:05,370
I agree with Jerry. We use the moon's
gravity to slingshot them around.

950
01:08:05,433 --> 01:08:09,722
- No, the LEM will not support three guys for that amount of time.
- It barely holds two.

951
01:08:09,738 --> 01:08:14,137
I mean, we've got to do a direct abort. We do an
about-face, bring the guys right home right now.

952
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,828
- Get 'em back soon.
- Absolutely.

953
01:08:15,870 --> 01:08:18,229
We don't even know if
the Odyssey's engine's even working.

954
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:20,330
And if there's been serious damage
to this spacecraft...

955
01:08:20,409 --> 01:08:21,768
They blow up and they die!

956
01:08:21,815 --> 01:08:23,920
- That is not the argument! We are talking about time!
- Jesus! Come on!

957
01:08:24,003 --> 01:08:27,131
I'm not gonna sugarcoat this for you!

958
01:08:27,173 --> 01:08:30,051
Okay, hold it.
Let's hold it down.

959
01:08:30,134 --> 01:08:33,346
Let's hold it down, people. The only engine
with enough power for a direct abort...

960
01:08:33,429 --> 01:08:35,848
is the SPS
on the service module.

961
01:08:35,932 --> 01:08:38,184
From what Lovell has told us, it could
have been damaged in an explosion,

962
01:08:38,267 --> 01:08:40,186
so let's consider
that engine dead.

963
01:08:40,269 --> 01:08:42,269
We light that thing up,
could blow the whole works.

964
01:08:42,271 --> 01:08:44,816
It's just too risky.
We're not gonna take that chance.

965
01:08:44,857 --> 01:08:47,337
About the only thing the command
module is good for is re-entry.

966
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:51,072
So that leaves us with the LEM,
which means free-return trajectory.

967
01:08:51,155 --> 01:08:53,950
Once we get
the guys around the moon,

968
01:08:54,033 --> 01:08:56,369
we'll fire up the LEM engine,
make a long burn,

969
01:08:56,452 --> 01:08:58,913
pick up some speed
and get 'em home as quick as we can.

970
01:08:58,996 --> 01:09:02,709
Gene, I'm wondering what
the Grumman guys think about this.

971
01:09:02,792 --> 01:09:07,171
We can't make any guarantees.
We designed the LEM to land on the moon,

972
01:09:07,213 --> 01:09:09,549
not fire the engine out there
for course corrections.

973
01:09:09,632 --> 01:09:13,678
Well, unfortunately, we're not
landing on the moon, are we?

974
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:18,766
I don't care what anything was designed
to do. I care about what it can do.

975
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:23,062
Let's get to work.
Let's lay it out, okay?

976
01:09:23,813 --> 01:09:26,733
CAPCOM. Flight, he says
it will be ready in time.

977
01:09:27,269 --> 01:09:30,903
After this burn, we've got to build some time
in the flight plan for them to get some sleep.

978
01:09:30,987 --> 01:09:34,407
- Run it by the FAO.
- I've run it by the FAO.

979
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:36,409
Do we know how long
we're gonna fire that burn?

980
01:09:36,492 --> 01:09:39,746
- He specifically wanted a quote from a flight director.
- Who wanted a quote?

981
01:09:39,828 --> 01:09:41,708
- The President.
- The President?

982
01:09:41,763 --> 01:09:44,584
Nixon. He wants odds.

983
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:46,919
We are not losing the crew.

984
01:09:47,529 --> 01:09:49,922
Gene, I gotta give him odds.
Five to one against?

985
01:09:50,005 --> 01:09:51,778
- Three to one?
- I don't think they're that good.

986
01:09:51,826 --> 01:09:55,061
We are not losing those men!

987
01:09:58,723 --> 01:10:01,934
How long are they
gonna have to burn the engine?

988
01:10:02,869 --> 01:10:05,521
Look, tell him...
three to one.

989
01:10:08,024 --> 01:10:10,943
<i>Expect loss of signal
in less than one minute.</i>

990
01:10:11,026 --> 01:10:14,167
<i>When we pick you back up we will
have your PC plus two burn data.</i>

991
01:10:14,254 --> 01:10:19,619
Okay. Roger that, Houston. We'll hear
from you again at acquisition of signal.

992
01:10:21,371 --> 01:10:23,289
You wanna look?

993
01:10:25,483 --> 01:10:27,350
Oh, look at that.

994
01:10:28,961 --> 01:10:30,922
Wow.

995
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:40,264
<i>Aquarius, that's 30 seconds
until loss of signal.</i>

996
01:10:43,235 --> 01:10:46,646
Mare Tranquillitatis.

997
01:10:47,095 --> 01:10:49,941
Neil and Buzz's old neighbourhood.

998
01:10:50,477 --> 01:10:52,276
Comin' up on Mount Marilyn.

999
01:10:52,845 --> 01:10:56,280
Jim, you gotta
take a look at this.

1000
01:10:57,009 --> 01:10:58,658
I've seen it.

1001
01:11:04,741 --> 01:11:06,124
<i>Aquarius, this is Houston.</i>

1002
01:11:06,165 --> 01:11:11,129
<i>We expect loss of signal
in approximately ten seconds.</i>

1003
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:14,340
<i>So long, Earth.
Catch you on the flip side.</i>

1004
01:11:21,726 --> 01:11:23,883
<i>When you go
into the shadow of the moon...</i>

1005
01:11:23,929 --> 01:11:26,978
<i>and the moon is
between you and the sun,</i>

1006
01:11:27,469 --> 01:11:30,375
<i>you see stars that are more brilliant
than anything you've ever seen...</i>

1007
01:11:30,445 --> 01:11:32,900
<i>on the clearest nights
here on Earth.</i>

1008
01:11:32,984 --> 01:11:38,573
<i>And then you pass into the lunar sunrise
over the lunar surface.</i>

1009
01:11:38,656 --> 01:11:40,406
<i>It must be an awe-inspiring sight.</i>

1010
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:43,703
<i>I-I-I can't wait to see it myself.</i>

1011
01:11:43,786 --> 01:11:48,082
<i>The problem now is not so much
a question of an adequate oxygen supply,</i>

1012
01:11:48,166 --> 01:11:50,168
<i>but it is the rate
of consumption of water,</i>

1013
01:11:50,209 --> 01:11:53,421
<i>which is vitally needed
for the cooling operations...</i>

1014
01:11:53,504 --> 01:11:55,965
<i>to maintain the electronic systems
and so forth.</i>

1015
01:12:34,414 --> 01:12:37,256
Look, it's Fra Mauro.

1016
01:12:38,429 --> 01:12:40,051
I can see our landing site.

1017
01:12:42,443 --> 01:12:43,805
Wow.

1018
01:12:44,467 --> 01:12:48,157
Look at the Tsiolkovskii crater.

1019
01:12:49,632 --> 01:12:52,265
I can't believe how bright
the ejecta blanket is.

1020
01:12:52,343 --> 01:12:56,275
It's like snow. It's beautiful.

1021
01:12:57,226 --> 01:12:59,487
That's Mare Imbrium to the north.

1022
01:14:02,675 --> 01:14:04,635
<i>Thirteen, this is Houston.</i>

1023
01:14:04,677 --> 01:14:08,681
<i>We're reading your telemetry.
It's good to see you again.</i>

1024
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:11,225
Good to see you too, Houston.

1025
01:14:11,307 --> 01:14:15,529
<i>We are picking you up at a velocity
of 7,062 feet per second...</i>

1026
01:14:15,608 --> 01:14:19,275
<i>at a distance from the moon
of 56 nautical miles.</i>

1027
01:14:19,358 --> 01:14:22,570
<i>Stand by for your
PC plus two burn data.</i>

1028
01:14:23,363 --> 01:14:28,076
Got to tell you, I had an itch to take
this baby down, do some prospectin'.

1029
01:14:28,994 --> 01:14:31,537
Damn, we were close.

1030
01:14:33,515 --> 01:14:36,602
Gentlemen,
what are your intentions?

1031
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:42,215
I'd like to go home.

1032
01:14:45,108 --> 01:14:46,719
We got a burn coming up.

1033
01:14:46,803 --> 01:14:49,722
We're gonna need a contingency
if we lose comm with Houston.

1034
01:14:50,829 --> 01:14:54,352
Freddo, let's get an idea where
we stand on the consumables.

1035
01:14:54,868 --> 01:14:56,354
Jack, get into the Odyssey...

1036
01:14:56,396 --> 01:14:59,649
and bag up all the water you can
before it freezes in there.

1037
01:15:03,539 --> 01:15:04,408
Let's go home.

1038
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:08,115
<i>Aquarius, we got some PC
plus two burn data for you fellas.</i>

1039
01:15:08,258 --> 01:15:13,579
So you're telling me you can
only give our guys 45 hours?

1040
01:15:13,621 --> 01:15:17,583
That brings them to about there.

1041
01:15:21,171 --> 01:15:22,422
Gentlemen, that's not acceptable.

1042
01:15:22,463 --> 01:15:25,925
Gene, Gene, we've got
to talk about power.

1043
01:15:26,008 --> 01:15:29,053
Whoa, whoa, guys!
Power is everything!

1044
01:15:29,429 --> 01:15:31,556
- Power is everything.
- What do you mean?

1045
01:15:31,597 --> 01:15:34,726
Without it, they don't talk to us,
they don't correct their trajectory,

1046
01:15:34,767 --> 01:15:36,728
they don't turn
the heat shield around.

1047
01:15:37,104 --> 01:15:41,607
We gotta turn everything off, now.
They're not gonna make it to re-entry.

1048
01:15:41,649 --> 01:15:45,111
- What do you mean, "everything"?
- With everything on, the LEM draws 60 amps.

1049
01:15:45,194 --> 01:15:49,574
At that rate, in 16 hours
the batteries are dead, not 45.

1050
01:15:49,615 --> 01:15:52,118
And so is the crew.
We gotta get them down to 12 amps.

1051
01:15:52,201 --> 01:15:54,162
- Twelve amps?
- How many?

1052
01:15:54,245 --> 01:15:56,581
You can't run a vacuum cleaner
on 12 amps, John.

1053
01:15:56,622 --> 01:16:00,251
We gotta turn off... We have to
turn off the radars, cabin heater,

1054
01:16:00,293 --> 01:16:02,587
instrument displays,
the guidance computer, the whole smash.

1055
01:16:02,628 --> 01:16:05,652
Whoa! Guidance computer.
What if they need to do another burn?

1056
01:16:05,691 --> 01:16:07,285
They won't even know
which way they're pointed.

1057
01:16:07,324 --> 01:16:11,277
The more time we talk down here, the more juice they waste
up there. I've been looking at the data for the past hour.

1058
01:16:11,363 --> 01:16:13,765
- That's the deal?
- That's the deal.

1059
01:16:18,529 --> 01:16:23,316
Okay, John. The minute we finish
the burn, we'll power down the LEM.

1060
01:16:23,399 --> 01:16:25,443
All right.

1061
01:16:25,485 --> 01:16:29,864
Now in the meantime, we're gonna have
a frozen command module up there.

1062
01:16:30,243 --> 01:16:33,201
In a couple of days we're gonna have to power
it up using nothing but the re-entry batteries.

1063
01:16:33,284 --> 01:16:37,121
- That's never been tried before.
- We've never even simulated it before Gene.

1064
01:16:37,163 --> 01:16:39,374
Well, we're gonna
have to figure it out.

1065
01:16:39,854 --> 01:16:43,169
I want people in our simulators
working re-entry scenarios.

1066
01:16:43,252 --> 01:16:47,048
I want you to find every engineer who designed
every switch, every circuit, every transistor,

1067
01:16:47,131 --> 01:16:48,115
and every light bulb
that's up there.

1068
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:51,990
Then I want you to talk to the guy in the
assembly line who actually built the thing.

1069
01:16:52,029 --> 01:16:56,224
Find out how to squeeze every amp
out of both of these goddamn machines.

1070
01:16:56,599 --> 01:17:01,562
I want this mark all the way
back to Earth with time to spare.

1071
01:17:02,021 --> 01:17:03,564
We never lost
an American in space.

1072
01:17:03,648 --> 01:17:06,067
We're sure as hell not
gonna lose one on my watch.

1073
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:08,069
Failure is not an option.

1074
01:17:13,112 --> 01:17:14,059
Ken?

1075
01:17:15,178 --> 01:17:16,387
Ken?

1076
01:17:17,403 --> 01:17:20,039
- What? Huh?
- Good, you're not dead.

1077
01:17:20,528 --> 01:17:22,917
I've been trying to get in touch
with you for 45 minutes.

1078
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,002
Jesus, John,
what are you doing here?

1079
01:17:25,086 --> 01:17:27,004
I gotta get you in the simulators.
We got a ship to land.

1080
01:17:27,088 --> 01:17:29,340
- What?
- There's been an explosion.

1081
01:17:29,686 --> 01:17:32,677
Oxygen tanks are gone. Two fuel cells
gone. Command module shut down.

1082
01:17:33,749 --> 01:17:35,680
- What about the crew?
- Crew's fine so far.

1083
01:17:35,763 --> 01:17:37,849
Trying to keep them
alive in the LEM.

1084
01:17:38,225 --> 01:17:40,852
We're gonna have to shut
that down pretty soon too.

1085
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:44,021
We got a lot of people working
the numbers on this one, Ken.

1086
01:17:44,105 --> 01:17:46,866
Nobody's too sure how much power
we're gonna have when we hit re-entry.

1087
01:17:46,941 --> 01:17:49,861
The command module's gonna be
frozen up pretty good by then.

1088
01:17:51,498 --> 01:17:54,699
You see this ammeter rise over 20
at any point, power-up is no good.

1089
01:17:54,782 --> 01:17:57,102
We see it spike, that's sayonara
for the guidance computer.

1090
01:17:57,118 --> 01:17:59,203
Our guys can't re-enter. Okay?

1091
01:17:59,287 --> 01:18:01,205
How much power do we have
to play with?

1092
01:18:01,289 --> 01:18:03,541
Barely enough to run this
coffee pot for nine hours.

1093
01:18:03,624 --> 01:18:05,877
- Go.
<i>- Yeah, Ken Mattingly just got here.</i>

1094
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:08,629
Copy. He's here.

1095
01:18:08,713 --> 01:18:10,882
They've been losing heat
since the accident.

1096
01:18:10,965 --> 01:18:13,718
They're gonna start getting water
condensation on the control panels.

1097
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:17,055
- Ken, glad you're here. You know what's going on?
- John's brought me up to speed.

1098
01:18:17,138 --> 01:18:19,390
- What do we have left in the batteries?
- We don't really know.

1099
01:18:19,473 --> 01:18:21,940
We gotta get started on
some shortcuts for power-up.

1100
01:18:22,043 --> 01:18:23,652
Yeah. You know how short?

1101
01:18:23,746 --> 01:18:27,559
Well, it's all in the sequencing, John. If we can
skip whatever we don't absolutely need,

1102
01:18:27,652 --> 01:18:30,026
- turn things on in the right order, maybe...
- I agree.

1103
01:18:30,068 --> 01:18:33,529
- You started on a procedure?
- The engineers have tried, but it's your ship.

1104
01:18:33,571 --> 01:18:36,449
- We gotta get you in there.
- Okay.

1105
01:18:36,532 --> 01:18:39,202
Frank, I need the sim
cold and dark.

1106
01:18:39,243 --> 01:18:41,704
Give me the exact same conditions
they've got in there now.

1107
01:18:41,746 --> 01:18:44,374
- I need present status of every instrument.
- You got it.

1108
01:18:44,415 --> 01:18:47,710
I need a flashlight.
That's not what they have up there.

1109
01:18:47,751 --> 01:18:49,878
Don't give me anything
they don't have on board.

1110
01:18:49,921 --> 01:18:52,256
Get this show on the road.
Put him in space, fellas.

1111
01:18:54,409 --> 01:18:58,756
Okay, Houston, the quad heater
circuit breakers are open.

1112
01:18:58,866 --> 01:18:59,389
<i>Copy that.</i>

1113
01:18:59,429 --> 01:19:02,250
We're using the forward omni
when the earth's in the window,

1114
01:19:02,328 --> 01:19:05,266
and we're switching to aft omni
when we see the moon.

1115
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:07,063
<i>We copy that, Thirteen.</i>

1116
01:19:07,105 --> 01:19:09,732
<i>Aquarius, we don't want you
to make any more waste dumps.</i>

1117
01:19:09,774 --> 01:19:12,568
<i>The venting may
push you off course.</i>

1118
01:19:13,242 --> 01:19:15,738
- Oh, Christ.
- What's up?

1119
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:20,076
No more waste dumps.
We're just gonna have to store it.

1120
01:19:20,118 --> 01:19:22,120
Jack, we're gonna need
some more urine bags.

1121
01:19:23,278 --> 01:19:26,791
Okay, Houston, that leaves us
with just the computer,

1122
01:19:27,371 --> 01:19:31,671
which I'm shutting down now.

1123
01:19:36,467 --> 01:19:38,428
And that's it.

1124
01:19:38,859 --> 01:19:42,071
We just put Sir Isaac Newton
in the driver's seat.

1125
01:19:47,595 --> 01:19:49,272
Is it a.m. or p.m.?

1126
01:19:49,837 --> 01:19:52,775
A.m. Very, very a.m.

1127
01:19:52,817 --> 01:19:55,445
Haise is running a temperature,
and none of them has slept.

1128
01:19:55,493 --> 01:19:59,486
I can't order these guys to go to sleep.
Could you sleep up there?

1129
01:19:59,512 --> 01:20:01,722
It's gonna get awful cold
in there for those guys.

1130
01:20:03,536 --> 01:20:07,290
Gene, we have a situation
brewing with the carbon dioxide.

1131
01:20:07,331 --> 01:20:09,709
We got a CO2 filter problem
on the lunar module.

1132
01:20:09,792 --> 01:20:13,296
- Five filters on the LEM.
- Meant for 2 guys for a day and a half.

1133
01:20:13,337 --> 01:20:15,798
- So I told the doc...
- They're already up to 8 on the gauges.

1134
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,052
Anything over 15 and you get
impaired judgement, blackouts,

1135
01:20:19,135 --> 01:20:22,597
- beginnings of brain asphyxia.
- What about the scrubbers on the command module?

1136
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:25,160
- They take square cartridges.
- The ones on the LEM are round.

1137
01:20:27,606 --> 01:20:29,937
Tell me this isn't
a government operation.

1138
01:20:30,021 --> 01:20:32,690
This just isn't a contingency
we've remotely looked at.

1139
01:20:32,732 --> 01:20:34,901
Those CO2 levels
are gonna be getting toxic.

1140
01:20:34,984 --> 01:20:40,239
Well, I suggest you gentlemen invent a way
to put a square peg in a round hole rapidly.

1141
01:20:43,538 --> 01:20:45,538
Okay, people, listen up.

1142
01:20:45,617 --> 01:20:50,416
The people upstairs have handed us
this one, and we gotta come through.

1143
01:20:51,038 --> 01:20:54,587
We gotta find a way
to make this...

1144
01:20:54,670 --> 01:20:57,423
fit into the hole for this...

1145
01:20:58,202 --> 01:21:00,093
using nothing but that.

1146
01:21:01,636 --> 01:21:04,263
- Let's get it organized.
- Okay, let's build a filter.

1147
01:21:04,347 --> 01:21:07,392
Better get some coffee
going too, someone.

1148
01:21:07,634 --> 01:21:10,269
<i>The Haise family
lives in El Lago, Texas.</i>

1149
01:21:10,353 --> 01:21:13,106
<i>His wife, Mary,
is from Biloxi, Mississippi.</i>

1150
01:21:13,189 --> 01:21:15,108
<i>When Fred Haise
was growing up in Biloxi,</i>

1151
01:21:15,191 --> 01:21:17,276
<i>he may have looked
ahead to a fine family,</i>

1152
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,278
<i>but he never dreamt of flying.</i>

1153
01:21:19,362 --> 01:21:21,781
<i>I'd never flown really
before I went into the service,</i>

1154
01:21:21,864 --> 01:21:26,160
<i>and I only went into the flying business
as a means to getting a commission.</i>

1155
01:21:26,244 --> 01:21:29,247
- Good morning.
- Henry. Don't you ever sleep?

1156
01:21:29,288 --> 01:21:33,418
- I have a request from the news people.
- Uh-huh.

1157
01:21:33,501 --> 01:21:36,087
They want to put
a transmitter up on the lawn.

1158
01:21:38,709 --> 01:21:40,091
Transmitter?

1159
01:21:40,133 --> 01:21:42,760
It's kind of a tower
for a live broadcast.

1160
01:21:47,991 --> 01:21:52,353
I thought they didn't care about this mission.
They didn't even run Jim's show.

1161
01:21:53,686 --> 01:21:56,856
Well... it's more dramatic now.
Suddenly people are...

1162
01:21:56,941 --> 01:22:00,445
Landing on the moon wasn't dramatic
enough for them. Why should not landing be?

1163
01:22:01,345 --> 01:22:05,064
Look, I, um, realize
how hard this is, Marilyn,

1164
01:22:05,118 --> 01:22:06,951
but the whole world
is caught up in it.

1165
01:22:07,156 --> 01:22:09,703
- It's the biggest story since...
- No, Henry.

1166
01:22:10,196 --> 01:22:14,625
Those people don't put one piece
of equipment on my lawn.

1167
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:18,463
If they have a problem with that,
they can take it up with my husband.

1168
01:22:18,504 --> 01:22:20,965
He'll be home on Friday.

1175
01:23:04,925 --> 01:23:06,594
Hey, Freddo.

1176
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:10,723
It's too cold in there.

1177
01:23:10,807 --> 01:23:13,935
Yeah.

1178
01:23:24,223 --> 01:23:26,280
That's a nice one of Mary.

1179
01:23:29,848 --> 01:23:32,412
- You don't look too good, Freddo.
- I'll survive.

1180
01:23:33,534 --> 01:23:35,373
- There's some aspirin in the medical kit.
- I took some.

1181
01:23:35,456 --> 01:23:37,709
Jim, I'm all right.

1182
01:23:42,686 --> 01:23:46,384
It was an accident,
Mary gettin' pregnant.

1183
01:23:47,694 --> 01:23:51,556
You should have seen the look
on my face when she told me.

1184
01:23:52,506 --> 01:23:55,678
Well, that has
a tendency to happen.

1185
01:23:56,904 --> 01:23:57,895
Yeah.

1186
01:24:02,483 --> 01:24:04,610
I wonder if it's
a boy or a girl.

1187
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,656
You're gonna find out
soon enough.

1188
01:24:10,031 --> 01:24:11,576
Sure.

1189
01:24:14,985 --> 01:24:17,915
I never dreamed I'd ever get
to do something like this:

1190
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:20,501
Come up here on a real mission.

1191
01:24:22,746 --> 01:24:24,255
Most of the guys
I graduated high school with...

1192
01:24:24,338 --> 01:24:26,841
never even left home,
and here I am.

1193
01:24:26,924 --> 01:24:32,138
Oh, yeah... here you are.

1194
01:24:36,612 --> 01:24:38,102
It hurts when I urinate.

1195
01:24:39,651 --> 01:24:41,065
Well, you're not
gettin' enough water.

1196
01:24:41,144 --> 01:24:43,964
I'm drinking my ration
the same as you.

1197
01:24:47,425 --> 01:24:49,620
I think old Swigert
gave me the clap.

1198
01:24:51,198 --> 01:24:55,003
He's been pissin' in my relief tube.

1199
01:24:56,941 --> 01:25:00,737
Well... that will be a hot one at
the debriefing for the flight surgeon.

1200
01:25:00,808 --> 01:25:05,464
That's another first
for America's space program.

1201
01:25:06,987 --> 01:25:12,018
Listen, um... I've been
going... over some stuff,

1202
01:25:12,072 --> 01:25:17,975
and I'm a little worried about this cold
affecting our battery efficiency.

1203
01:25:18,059 --> 01:25:22,271
We quit heatin' the glycol to save
water and power, so that's not helping.

1204
01:25:22,313 --> 01:25:24,273
It could cost us
amp hours on the back end?

1205
01:25:24,315 --> 01:25:27,151
- That's a possibility.
- I've been goin' over the numbers again.

1206
01:25:28,632 --> 01:25:30,320
Have they called up
with a re-entry plan yet?

1207
01:25:30,363 --> 01:25:33,032
- Cause we're comin' in too shallow and fast.
- We're workin' on something. Hold on.

1208
01:25:33,116 --> 01:25:35,034
I can't remember
the ratio to temperature.

1209
01:25:35,118 --> 01:25:37,036
We got no references on board.

1210
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,038
Well, let's see if Houston
can pull up the mill specs on it.

1211
01:25:39,122 --> 01:25:43,084
Listen, listen! They gave us too much
Delta V. They had us burn too long.

1212
01:25:43,167 --> 01:25:46,379
At this rate we're gonna skip right out of the
atmosphere, and we're never gonna get back.

1213
01:25:47,547 --> 01:25:49,841
What are you talkin' about?
How'd you figure that?

1214
01:25:50,509 --> 01:25:52,261
I can add.

1215
01:25:53,802 --> 01:25:57,693
- Jack, they've got half the Ph.Ds on the planet working on this.
- Houston says we're on the money.

1216
01:25:57,763 --> 01:26:00,270
What if they made a mistake, alright?
And there was no way to reverse it?

1217
01:26:00,341 --> 01:26:01,519
Do you think they would tell us?

1218
01:26:01,561 --> 01:26:04,787
- There's no reason for them to tell us.
- What do you mean they're not gonna tell us? That's bullshit!

1219
01:26:04,842 --> 01:26:07,567
Alright. There's a thousand things
that have to happen in order.

1220
01:26:07,650 --> 01:26:12,739
We are on number eight.
You're talking about number 692.

1221
01:26:12,822 --> 01:26:15,908
And in the meantime, I'm trying to
tell you we're coming in too fast.

1222
01:26:15,992 --> 01:26:19,078
I think they know it, and that's why
we don't have a goddamn re-entry plan.

1223
01:26:19,162 --> 01:26:21,205
That's duly noted.
Thank you, Jack.

1224
01:26:22,335 --> 01:26:22,968
Ow!

1225
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:25,877
- Goddamn this piece of shit!
- Hey!

1226
01:26:25,918 --> 01:26:28,212
- This piece of shit's gonna get you home.
- All right.

1227
01:26:28,254 --> 01:26:31,966
That's because that's
the only thing we got left, Jack!

1228
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:36,554
- What are you saying, Fred?
- I think you know what I'm saying.

1229
01:26:36,595 --> 01:26:40,101
Now wait a minute.
All I did was stir those tanks.

1230
01:26:40,164 --> 01:26:41,953
What was that gauge reading
before you hit the switch?

1231
01:26:41,998 --> 01:26:43,874
Don't tell me how to fly
the damn CM, alright!

1232
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:45,905
- You don't even know, do you?
- They brought me into here to do a job!

1233
01:26:45,961 --> 01:26:48,422
They asked me to stir the damn tanks,
and I stirred the tanks!

1234
01:26:48,483 --> 01:26:51,922
- Jack. Stop kicking yourself in the ass.
- This is not my fault!

1235
01:26:51,984 --> 01:26:53,944
No one is saying it is.

1236
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:57,875
If I'm in the left-hand seat when
the call comes up, I stir the tanks.

1237
01:26:57,969 --> 01:26:59,063
Yeah, well, tell him that.

1238
01:26:59,117 --> 01:27:02,329
I just asked you what the gauge
was readin', and you don't know!

1239
01:27:02,373 --> 01:27:04,389
Look, we're not doing this, gentlemen.
We are not gonna do this.

1240
01:27:04,444 --> 01:27:07,085
We're not gonna go bouncing
off the walls for ten minutes...

1241
01:27:07,126 --> 01:27:10,088
because we're just gonna end up right
back here with the same problems!

1242
01:27:10,129 --> 01:27:13,257
Try to figure out
how to stay alive!

1243
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:15,802
<i>Aquarius, this is Houston.</i>

1244
01:27:15,885 --> 01:27:18,679
- Are we on VOX?
- No, we're not on VOX.

1245
01:27:18,763 --> 01:27:21,307
Yeah, Houston, this is Aquarius.
Go ahead.

1246
01:27:22,672 --> 01:27:27,105
<i>Yeah, Jim, could you check
your CO2 gauge for us?</i>

1247
01:27:29,121 --> 01:27:31,317
Yeah, Houston,
we were just looking at that.

1248
01:27:31,401 --> 01:27:35,321
Our CO2 measurement has jumped
four notches in the last hour.

1249
01:27:35,405 --> 01:27:38,282
That can't be right.
I went over those numbers three times.

1250
01:27:38,366 --> 01:27:42,203
<i>Jim, that sounds about right.
We were expecting that.</i>

1251
01:27:42,286 --> 01:27:45,540
Well, that's very comforting to know,
Houston. What do we do about it?

1252
01:27:45,919 --> 01:27:50,211
<i>Jim, we're working on a procedure
down here for you.</i>

1253
01:27:51,317 --> 01:27:52,950
<i>- Do you copy?</i>
- Oh, Christ.

1254
01:27:53,012 --> 01:27:54,882
All right, Houston, we're
standing by for those procedures.

1255
01:27:54,966 --> 01:27:58,219
Christ, I know why
my numbers are wrong.

1256
01:27:58,302 --> 01:28:01,055
I only figured it
for two people.

1257
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:08,229
Maybe I should just
hold my breath.

1258
01:28:08,312 --> 01:28:13,067
<i>The deadly CO2 gas is literally poisoning the
astronauts with every breath in and out.</i>

1259
01:28:13,151 --> 01:28:16,154
Heads up. Heads up.

1260
01:28:16,237 --> 01:28:19,741
- Oh! Go, go, go, go!
- Someone get that. Damn.

1261
01:28:20,323 --> 01:28:22,283
Heads up, people.
Look out now.

1262
01:28:24,996 --> 01:28:28,499
- What's this?
- That's what they gotta make.

1263
01:28:29,114 --> 01:28:32,003
- I hope you got the procedures for me.
- Right here.

1264
01:28:32,086 --> 01:28:34,005
That's it?

1265
01:28:35,923 --> 01:28:37,842
<i>All right, Aquarius, this is Houston.</i>

1266
01:28:37,925 --> 01:28:39,844
<i>Do you have a flight plan up there?</i>

1267
01:28:39,927 --> 01:28:43,014
Affirmative, Andy.
Jack's got one right here.

1268
01:28:43,097 --> 01:28:47,018
Okay, we have an unusual
procedure for you here.

1269
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:49,020
<i>We need you
to rip the cover off.</i>

1270
01:28:49,062 --> 01:28:51,522
He wants you to rip the cover
off the flight plan.

1271
01:28:52,613 --> 01:28:54,035
With pleasure.

1272
01:28:54,088 --> 01:28:56,652
<i>Alright, now, the other materials
you're gonna need here are...</i>

1273
01:28:56,715 --> 01:28:58,816
- a lithium hydroxide canister...
- Two, two.

1274
01:28:58,855 --> 01:29:01,366
Two lithium hydroxide canisters.
I'm sorry.

1275
01:29:01,785 --> 01:29:03,910
- A roll of gray tape.
- Duct tape.

1276
01:29:03,993 --> 01:29:09,082
<i>Duct tape. You need an LCG bag...
Two LCG bags.</i>

1277
01:29:09,165 --> 01:29:12,710
<i>The red suit hoses,
and you've got the flight plan cover.</i>

1278
01:29:14,796 --> 01:29:17,715
- Can you give me a timetable?
- Henry! Henry!

1279
01:29:17,757 --> 01:29:19,926
What about their level
of carbon dioxide?

1280
01:29:20,009 --> 01:29:22,220
It's, uh, climbing.

1281
01:29:23,959 --> 01:29:26,303
You're saying that they're
almost out of breathable air?

1282
01:29:26,357 --> 01:29:30,728
No wait a second. That's not what he said.
He said we're working on it.

1283
01:29:31,754 --> 01:29:34,440
<i>You want to cut
the duct tape three feet long.</i>

1284
01:29:34,929 --> 01:29:36,514
- Tell him to use his arm.
- Just use your arm.

1285
01:29:36,569 --> 01:29:39,570
<i>- It's a good arm's length.</i>
- I see what you're getting at. Hold on.

1286
01:29:39,654 --> 01:29:42,740
Okay Jack, tear that piece of tape
down the middle lengthwise.

1287
01:29:43,136 --> 01:29:45,555
<i>- All right?</i>
- Hold on, Houston.

1288
01:29:46,953 --> 01:29:50,081
<i>While the astronauts appear to have
enough oxygen to keep them alive,</i>

1289
01:29:50,164 --> 01:29:53,418
<i>one thing they have too much of
is carbon dioxide.</i>

1290
01:29:53,501 --> 01:29:55,420
<i>With each breath,
the three men expel...</i>

1291
01:29:55,503 --> 01:29:58,756
<i>more of the poisonous gas
into the lunar module cockpit,</i>

1292
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:01,516
<i>and the scrubbers intended to
keep the atmosphere breathable...</i>

1293
01:30:01,594 --> 01:30:03,513
<i>are quickly becoming saturated.</i>

1294
01:30:06,641 --> 01:30:08,099
Oh, shit. I tore it.

1295
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:10,516
Shit!

1296
01:30:11,561 --> 01:30:15,982
Houston, what do we do if we
ripped the bag? Can we tape it?

1297
01:30:16,065 --> 01:30:18,109
- They just tore the bag.
- Oh, no.

1298
01:30:18,192 --> 01:30:20,278
Uh, stand by.
What should I tell 'em to do?

1299
01:30:20,361 --> 01:30:22,045
They should have one more left.

1300
01:30:22,076 --> 01:30:24,949
<i>But they've still got
a long way to come.</i>

1301
01:30:25,033 --> 01:30:29,746
<i>And they are now working on their backup
facilities, their emergency facilities.</i>

1302
01:30:29,787 --> 01:30:34,167
<i>The problem is, if anything more
goes wrong, they're in real trouble.</i>

1303
01:31:03,071 --> 01:31:07,116
<i>And as most of you are aware, there is
no rescue possible in space flight.</i>

1304
01:31:07,157 --> 01:31:11,730
<i>Any rescue system the space agency
has long since calculated...</i>

1305
01:31:11,793 --> 01:31:15,458
<i>Any... Since any rescue system
the space agency calculated...</i>

1306
01:31:20,213 --> 01:31:22,965
- One sock.
<i>- Once you have the sock in place,</i>

1307
01:31:23,007 --> 01:31:25,676
- we're gonna want you to bungee...
- Work it in.

1308
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,054
<i>...the entire filter assembly
to the bulkhead,</i>

1309
01:31:28,589 --> 01:31:31,716
<i>- right above the LEM canister.</i>
- We're getting close to 15.

1310
01:31:32,956 --> 01:31:36,562
So how does this flight compare to other
emergency situations you've faced?

1311
01:31:38,386 --> 01:31:41,234
Well I'd have to say that this is
the most serious situation...

1312
01:31:41,317 --> 01:31:44,112
we've ever encountered
in manned space flight.

1313
01:31:44,195 --> 01:31:48,241
- Houston, filter's in place.
- Cabin gas return to egress.

1314
01:31:48,324 --> 01:31:50,576
Suit circuit relief to close.

1315
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:55,081
- CO2 canister select to secondary.
- All right.

1316
01:31:55,757 --> 01:31:56,859
Here goes.

1317
01:31:58,334 --> 01:32:01,295
I can hear air moving.

1318
01:32:13,499 --> 01:32:15,143
Just breathe normal, fellas.

1319
01:32:17,603 --> 01:32:21,107
<i>Aquarius, please advise on CO2 status.</i>

1320
01:32:21,190 --> 01:32:24,193
Yeah, Houston, we're taking
a look at those numbers right now.

1321
01:32:28,399 --> 01:32:31,071
<i>We're still holding
close to 15, Houston.</i>

1322
01:32:31,492 --> 01:32:33,399
<i>Roger that. Standing by.</i>

1323
01:32:44,412 --> 01:32:48,425
Houston, the CO2 level
has dropped to nine...

1324
01:32:49,256 --> 01:32:52,045
and it is still falling.

1325
01:32:52,256 --> 01:32:55,266
- Yes!
- Great. Good job, you guys.

1326
01:32:55,783 --> 01:32:57,934
That is good to hear, Aquarius.

1327
01:32:57,977 --> 01:33:01,773
And you, sir,
are a steely-eyed missile man.

1328
01:33:05,528 --> 01:33:07,445
Okay, spacecraft control to computer.

1329
01:33:09,442 --> 01:33:10,156
Damn!

1330
01:33:13,466 --> 01:33:14,154
Damn.

1331
01:33:16,294 --> 01:33:17,538
We overloaded.

1332
01:33:18,364 --> 01:33:19,340
<i>We used way too much power.</i>

1333
01:33:19,411 --> 01:33:23,932
<i>There must be a sneak circuit someplace
between step seven and ten.</i>

1334
01:33:23,995 --> 01:33:29,050
- Alright. Which one has the leak?
- Don't know that yet, John.

1335
01:33:29,133 --> 01:33:32,136
The sequence was wrong. We just have to
go back and try 'em one at a time.

1336
01:33:34,048 --> 01:33:35,390
You need a break, Ken?

1337
01:33:36,251 --> 01:33:38,476
If they don't get one,
I don't get one.

1338
01:33:42,647 --> 01:33:45,233
Well, if it won't work,
get me another one.

1339
01:33:45,316 --> 01:33:48,569
- My son's supposed to be on.
- I know, Mrs. Lovell.

1340
01:33:48,653 --> 01:33:53,741
- Hi, Blanch.
- They can't fix damn a thing in this place.

1341
01:33:53,825 --> 01:33:56,744
Blanch, it's Marilyn.

1342
01:33:56,828 --> 01:33:58,913
Hi, Grandma.

1343
01:33:59,464 --> 01:34:04,168
- I was gonna see Jimmy.
- I know. I know.

1344
01:34:05,647 --> 01:34:08,256
We came to tell you something.

1345
01:34:08,659 --> 01:34:13,261
There's been an accident.
Jimmy's okay. He's all right.

1346
01:34:14,937 --> 01:34:17,682
But he's not gonna get
to walk on the moon.

1347
01:34:18,703 --> 01:34:21,060
Well, they said he was.

1348
01:34:21,144 --> 01:34:23,104
I know. I know.

1349
01:34:25,843 --> 01:34:27,358
That was before.

1350
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:31,195
Now there's been an explosion,
and they're all okay.

1351
01:34:31,237 --> 01:34:35,450
They're all right.
But now they're just going to...

1352
01:34:36,632 --> 01:34:39,120
try to figure out
a way to get them home.

1353
01:34:41,561 --> 01:34:42,765
And...

1354
01:34:45,444 --> 01:34:47,287
And it's a little bit dangerous.

1355
01:34:48,959 --> 01:34:50,647
Oh, sweetie.

1356
01:34:54,803 --> 01:34:56,387
Are you scared?

1357
01:35:00,773 --> 01:35:03,227
Well, don't you worry, honey.

1358
01:35:03,883 --> 01:35:06,953
If they could get
a washing machine to fly,

1359
01:35:08,547 --> 01:35:11,235
my Jimmy could land it.

1360
01:35:14,190 --> 01:35:18,576
<i>♪ You saw me standing alone ♪</i>

1361
01:35:22,330 --> 01:35:28,044
<i>♪ Without a dream in my heart ♪</i>

1362
01:35:31,114 --> 01:35:37,011
<i>♪ Without a love of my own ♪</i>

1363
01:35:49,593 --> 01:35:53,736
<i>Jack, you'll be happy to hear
we contacted President Nixon,</i>

1364
01:35:54,202 --> 01:35:57,407
<i>and he's gonna grant you
an extension on your income taxes...</i>

1365
01:35:58,030 --> 01:36:02,412
<i>since you are most decidedly
out of the country.</i>

1366
01:36:03,921 --> 01:36:05,081
Roger that, Houston.

1367
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:07,959
That's wonderful news.

1368
01:36:08,445 --> 01:36:10,294
Tell them they have to sleep.

1369
01:36:10,336 --> 01:36:12,630
Haise is running a fever of 104.

1370
01:36:12,714 --> 01:36:16,049
Thirteen, we've had another
request from the flight surgeon...

1371
01:36:16,134 --> 01:36:18,343
that you fellas get more sleep.

1372
01:36:18,428 --> 01:36:21,597
<i>He doesn't like
his readings down here.</i>

1373
01:36:21,639 --> 01:36:23,766
Let's see how
he feels about this.

1374
01:36:23,807 --> 01:36:27,513
I am sick and tired
of the entire western world...

1375
01:36:27,787 --> 01:36:32,483
knowing how my kidneys
are functioning!

1376
01:36:35,485 --> 01:36:36,863
Flight, I just lost Lovell!

1377
01:36:42,257 --> 01:36:44,162
Uh, Thirteen, this is Houston.

1378
01:36:45,112 --> 01:36:47,832
<i>Jim, we just had a drop-out
on your bio-med sensors.</i>

1379
01:36:48,701 --> 01:36:52,872
I'm not wearing
my bio-med sensors, Houston.

1380
01:37:01,676 --> 01:37:04,891
Okay, Jim. Copy that.

1381
01:37:19,664 --> 01:37:22,867
Flight. Now I'm losing all three of 'em!

1382
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:25,578
It's just a little
medical mutiny, Doc.

1383
01:37:26,145 --> 01:37:27,789
I'm sure the guys
are still with us.

1384
01:37:29,301 --> 01:37:31,042
Let's cut 'em some slack, okay?

1385
01:37:43,472 --> 01:37:46,891
Gene, tt's not the velocity,
it's the angle.

1386
01:37:47,206 --> 01:37:50,561
Maybe they're still venting something
and that's throwing off the trajectory,

1387
01:37:50,603 --> 01:37:52,563
but we are definitely
shallowing again.

1388
01:37:52,604 --> 01:37:55,564
- We are up to a 5.9.
- Damn it.

1389
01:37:55,610 --> 01:37:59,155
At this rate, they nick the earth's atmosphere and
bounce off into space, we'll never get them back.

1390
01:37:59,195 --> 01:38:01,572
- We need another burn to get them back in the corridor.
- Definitely another burn.

1391
01:38:01,614 --> 01:38:05,201
- Another burn. Copy that.
- Fire the engines and get 'em on course.

1392
01:38:25,660 --> 01:38:26,931
<i>Aquarius, this is Houston.</i>

1393
01:38:28,949 --> 01:38:30,518
Houston, Aquarius.

1394
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:33,813
<i>Jim, we've got another
course correction for you.</i>

1395
01:38:34,731 --> 01:38:35,982
What's up?

1396
01:38:36,864 --> 01:38:38,818
Something about another
course correction.

1397
01:38:38,901 --> 01:38:41,863
Uh, we copy, Houston.

1398
01:38:42,641 --> 01:38:46,047
Be advised it's gonna take Freddo and I
a while to power up the computer...

1399
01:38:46,117 --> 01:38:49,537
for the alignment platform
if we have to fire the engine.

1400
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:51,539
<i>Negative on that, Jim.</i>

1401
01:38:51,621 --> 01:38:54,876
<i>We can't spare power
for the computer.</i>

1402
01:38:55,246 --> 01:38:57,045
We gotta do this blind?

1403
01:38:57,127 --> 01:39:01,214
Houston, without the computer,
what do we use for orientation?

1404
01:39:01,299 --> 01:39:04,010
Shit, come on. We've got to be able
to give these guys something in there.

1405
01:39:04,093 --> 01:39:06,387
Without the power,
we can't give them a reading.

1406
01:39:06,471 --> 01:39:08,389
I'm not talking about power,
I'm talking about reference.

1407
01:39:08,473 --> 01:39:11,225
No, there's no references.
We have a bunch of debris up there.

1408
01:39:11,601 --> 01:39:14,729
Houston, what's the story
with this burn?

1409
01:39:14,812 --> 01:39:17,732
<i>We're trying to hash something out
down here, Aquarius.</i>

1410
01:39:18,244 --> 01:39:20,163
<i>Stand by.</i>

1411
01:39:20,322 --> 01:39:25,073
Well, now look, Houston. All we need to hold
attitude is one fixed point in space.

1412
01:39:25,577 --> 01:39:29,831
- Is that not correct?
<i>- Yeah. Roger that, Jim.</i>

1413
01:39:33,341 --> 01:39:35,750
Well, Houston, we've got one.

1414
01:39:36,279 --> 01:39:39,754
If we can keep the Earth
in the window, flying manually, the co-ax

1415
01:39:39,837 --> 01:39:41,756
<i>cross hairs
right on its terminator,</i>

1416
01:39:42,471 --> 01:39:45,510
<i>all I have to know is: How long
do we need to burn the engine?</i>

1417
01:39:45,846 --> 01:39:48,929
- The shorter, the better.
- Roger that, Jim.

1418
01:39:48,997 --> 01:39:51,265
Can they fly it manually
and still shut it down...

1419
01:39:51,349 --> 01:39:53,935
on time without the computer?

1420
01:39:56,488 --> 01:39:58,106
I guess that's the best we can do, Glen.

1421
01:39:58,189 --> 01:40:00,068
We're out of time.

1422
01:40:00,108 --> 01:40:02,193
<i>In order to enter
the atmosphere safely,</i>

1423
01:40:02,235 --> 01:40:05,613
<i>the crew must aim for a corridor
just two and a half degrees wide.</i>

1424
01:40:05,697 --> 01:40:09,117
<i>If they're too steep, they'll incinerate
in the steadily thickening air.</i>

1425
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:11,119
<i>If they're too shallow,
they'll ricochet...</i>

1426
01:40:11,202 --> 01:40:13,621
<i>off the atmosphere like
a rock skipping off a pond.</i>

1427
01:40:13,705 --> 01:40:15,957
<i>The re-entry corridor is,
in fact, so narrow...</i>

1428
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:18,126
<i>that if this basketball
were the Earth...</i>

1429
01:40:18,209 --> 01:40:20,128
<i>and this softball
were the moon,</i>

1430
01:40:20,211 --> 01:40:22,630
<i>and the two were placed
14 feet apart,</i>

1431
01:40:22,714 --> 01:40:26,926
<i>the crew would have to hit a target
no thicker than this piece of paper.</i>

1432
01:40:27,009 --> 01:40:29,387
Okay, people, on your toes.
We're doing this one blind.

1433
01:40:29,470 --> 01:40:32,056
Gene, I want you to understand
we've never tried this before:

1434
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:36,060
Burn, cold soak, burn,
cold soak, burn, manual control.

1435
01:40:36,144 --> 01:40:38,229
Look, it will ignite, will it not?

1436
01:40:38,312 --> 01:40:41,733
I just want you to know the engine's
never been tried like this.

1437
01:40:41,815 --> 01:40:44,234
That's all I'm trying to tell you.

1438
01:40:44,554 --> 01:40:45,835
I know what you're trying to do.

1439
01:40:45,913 --> 01:40:48,573
I guarantee you, I won't hold you
personally responsible.

1440
01:40:48,991 --> 01:40:52,618
If it lights, it lights.
Let Lovell do the rest.

1441
01:40:53,022 --> 01:40:54,620
Okay.

1442
01:40:54,704 --> 01:40:56,914
<i>They're gonna burn the engines
and steer it manually,</i>

1443
01:40:56,998 --> 01:40:59,876
<i>attempting to keep
the Earth in the window.</i>

1444
01:41:06,497 --> 01:41:09,761
Okay, this is gonna take
all three of us.

1445
01:41:09,844 --> 01:41:12,180
Freddo...

1446
01:41:12,263 --> 01:41:14,182
you handle the pitch.

1447
01:41:14,265 --> 01:41:16,684
Put on the translation
controllers, all backwards.

1448
01:41:16,768 --> 01:41:19,437
So if the Earth starts drifting down,

1449
01:41:19,479 --> 01:41:23,441
you need to thrust aft,
not forward.

1450
01:41:23,524 --> 01:41:25,485
I'll do the same on mine
with everything else.

1451
01:41:26,044 --> 01:41:28,438
We're going to burn at ten percent
thrust for 39 seconds.

1452
01:41:28,487 --> 01:41:31,239
- Jack, you time us.
- Got it.

1453
01:41:31,282 --> 01:41:33,677
Give us a count of
the last ten seconds up to 39.

1454
01:41:33,733 --> 01:41:36,194
Let's not miss this.

1455
01:41:38,790 --> 01:41:42,335
You up to this, Freddo?

1456
01:41:42,657 --> 01:41:44,337
I'm with you.

1457
01:41:44,993 --> 01:41:48,007
Standing by
for corridor control burn.

1458
01:41:48,091 --> 01:41:50,843
Okay, Jim,
you can fire when ready.

1459
01:41:50,927 --> 01:41:53,304
<i>You are go for the manual burn.</i>

1460
01:41:53,346 --> 01:41:57,016
Okay, X plus button
at ten seconds. Mark.

1461
01:41:57,100 --> 01:41:59,811
- Come on, baby. One more burn.
- Nine, eight,

1462
01:41:59,852 --> 01:42:02,480
seven, six, five,

1463
01:42:02,563 --> 01:42:04,816
- four, three,
- Ullage is go.

1464
01:42:04,899 --> 01:42:07,985
<i>...two, one, ignition!</i>

1465
01:42:09,112 --> 01:42:10,947
- She's burnin'!
- Oh, yeah.

1466
01:42:10,988 --> 01:42:13,770
- Master arm off.
- Okay, here we go.

1467
01:42:13,809 --> 01:42:17,870
<i>- Helium regulator on.
- RCS is go, 10% thrust.</i>

1468
01:42:17,954 --> 01:42:21,457
- Bring her around, Freddo.
- I'm tryin', but it's draggin'.

1469
01:42:22,241 --> 01:42:24,502
- Ten seconds.
<i>- Drop it down, Freddo.</i>

1470
01:42:24,544 --> 01:42:26,671
<i>- We're driftin'!
- No, hold what you got.</i>

1471
01:42:26,754 --> 01:42:28,881
<i>- I'll roll it. Back off.
- I can't get it stable.</i>

1472
01:42:28,965 --> 01:42:31,467
Shit. She's dancin' all over the place!

1473
01:42:31,509 --> 01:42:33,970
- Come to the right a little bit.
- Fifteen seconds.

1474
01:42:34,378 --> 01:42:36,472
<i>She's driftin'.
I'm losin' attitude.</i>

1475
01:42:36,831 --> 01:42:39,183
<i>Okay. Hold it right there.
That's it. Back. No, Freddo, back!</i>

1476
01:42:39,225 --> 01:42:41,853
<i>- Shit! I'm losin' it!
- Twenty seconds. Bring the Earth up.</i>

1477
01:42:41,936 --> 01:42:44,967
Forward, Fred.
Come on. Forward.

1478
01:42:45,006 --> 01:42:47,787
Shit, I lost it!
<i>Where is it? Where is it?</i>

1479
01:42:47,842 --> 01:42:50,111
<i>7 o'clock. Helium regulator's closed.</i>

1480
01:42:50,194 --> 01:42:52,530
Bring it down, Freddo.
Just nose it down.

1481
01:42:52,613 --> 01:42:54,373
- Okay, uh, okay, I got it!
- Thirty seconds.

1482
01:42:54,407 --> 01:42:57,201
<i>Little farther. Little farther.
Ease your touch!</i>

1483
01:42:57,243 --> 01:43:02,540
Damn it! Damn it, that's mine.
That's me. Around.

1484
01:43:02,582 --> 01:43:05,668
- A little more. Come on, baby.
- Come on, that's it. Hold it. Damn it!

1485
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:08,755
- Back! That's it! Hold it! Steady.
- ...seven, eight, nine!

1486
01:43:08,838 --> 01:43:11,549
Shutdown!

1487
01:43:21,218 --> 01:43:22,727
Houston, we have shutdown.

1488
01:43:22,769 --> 01:43:26,564
<i>That's close enough, Jim. Good work.</i>

1489
01:43:26,606 --> 01:43:29,609
I knew it! I knew it!
How about that LEM, huh?

1490
01:43:30,028 --> 01:43:32,070
How about it?

1491
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:34,864
- Guess you can keep your job.
- You betcha.

1492
01:43:34,906 --> 01:43:39,535
<i>Thirteen, stand by. We're evaluating
our power usage on that burn.</i>

1493
01:43:40,787 --> 01:43:43,539
Well, let's hope we don't
have to do that again.

1494
01:43:57,167 --> 01:44:02,026
Gentlemen, you've given our guys
enough to survive 'til re-entry.

1495
01:44:02,175 --> 01:44:04,135
Well done.

1496
01:44:07,653 --> 01:44:10,900
Now we gotta get 'em in, so tell me
about the power-up procedures.

1497
01:44:10,942 --> 01:44:13,444
Here's the order
of what I want to do.

1498
01:44:13,528 --> 01:44:18,241
I want to power up Guidance,
ECS, Communications,

1499
01:44:18,282 --> 01:44:22,328
warm up the pyros for the parachutes
and the command module thrusters.

1500
01:44:22,412 --> 01:44:24,831
The thrusters are gonna
put you over budget on amps, Ken.

1501
01:44:25,734 --> 01:44:29,335
Well, they've been sitting at 200 below for
four days, John. They gotta be heated.

1502
01:44:29,419 --> 01:44:31,462
Fine. Then trade off
the parachutes, something.

1503
01:44:32,093 --> 01:44:34,465
Well, if the chutes
don't open, what's the point?

1504
01:44:34,549 --> 01:44:38,049
Ken, you're telling me what you need. I'm telling
you what we have to work with at this point.

1505
01:44:38,111 --> 01:44:39,637
I'm not making this stuff up.

1506
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:41,931
They're going to need
all these systems, John.

1507
01:44:41,973 --> 01:44:46,310
We do not have the power, Ken.
<i>We just don't have it.</i>

1508
01:44:49,163 --> 01:44:51,482
Okay, I'm gonna go back
and reorganize the sequencing again...

1509
01:44:51,566 --> 01:44:53,693
and find more power.

1510
01:44:53,776 --> 01:44:57,864
Let's start from scratch.
Clear the board.

1511
01:44:59,711 --> 01:45:02,702
I don't know where the hell
we're gonna find it.

1512
01:45:02,811 --> 01:45:06,372
<i>Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell
has more time in space,</i>

1513
01:45:06,456 --> 01:45:09,333
<i>almost 24 days already,
than any other man,</i>

1514
01:45:09,417 --> 01:45:12,045
<i>and I asked him recently
if he ever was scared.</i>

1515
01:45:12,128 --> 01:45:15,339
<i>I've had an engine flame out
a few times in an aircraft...</i>

1516
01:45:15,422 --> 01:45:19,009
<i>and was kind of curious as to whether it
was going to light up again, things of that nature,</i>

1517
01:45:19,052 --> 01:45:22,346
<i>but, uh, they seem to work out.</i>

1518
01:45:23,126 --> 01:45:25,683
<i>Is there a specific instance
in an airplane emergency...</i>

1519
01:45:25,725 --> 01:45:27,685
<i>when you can recall fear?</i>

1520
01:45:29,030 --> 01:45:31,148
<i>Uh, well, I'll tell you, I
remember this one time,</i>

1521
01:45:31,227 --> 01:45:35,902
<i>I'm in a Banshee at night in combat conditions,
so there's no running lights on the carrier.</i>

1522
01:45:35,977 --> 01:45:38,250
<i>It was the Shangri-la,
and we were in the Sea of Japan.</i>

1523
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:42,463
<i>And my radar had jammed,
and my homing signal was gone...</i>

1524
01:45:42,526 --> 01:45:45,205
<i>because somebody in Japan
was actually using the same frequency,</i>

1525
01:45:45,315 --> 01:45:49,332
<i>and so it was leading me away
from where I was supposed to be.</i>

1526
01:45:49,374 --> 01:45:55,088
<i>And I'm looking down at a big, black ocean,
so I flip on my map light.</i>

1527
01:45:55,171 --> 01:45:58,749
<i>And then, suddenly, zap, everything
shorts out right there in my cockpit.</i>

1528
01:45:58,827 --> 01:46:02,887
<i>All my instruments are gone. My lights are
gone and I can't even tell what my altitude is.</i>

1529
01:46:03,983 --> 01:46:08,184
<i>I know I'm running out of fuel, so I'm
thinking about ditching into the ocean.</i>

1530
01:46:08,943 --> 01:46:11,729
<i>I look down there
and then, in the darkness,</i>

1531
01:46:11,771 --> 01:46:14,899
<i>there's this, uh,
there's this green trail.</i>

1532
01:46:14,941 --> 01:46:19,612
<i>It's like a long carpet that's just laid
out right beneath me. It was the algae.</i>

1533
01:46:19,696 --> 01:46:21,614
<i>Right. It was that phosphorescent stuff...</i>

1534
01:46:21,698 --> 01:46:24,075
<i>that gets churned up
in the wake of a big ship.</i>

1535
01:46:24,157 --> 01:46:27,244
<i>And it was, it was, it was
just leading me home.</i>

1536
01:46:27,286 --> 01:46:30,262
<i>Now, if my cockpit lights
hadn't shorted out,</i>

1537
01:46:30,317 --> 01:46:32,667
<i>there's no way I'd have ever
been able to see that.</i>

1538
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:35,253
<i>So, uh, you, uh,
you never know...</i>

1539
01:46:35,294 --> 01:46:39,090
<i>what, what events are going
to transpire to get you home.</i>

1540
01:46:42,348 --> 01:46:48,057
<i>Okay. Spacecraft commander Jim Lovell,
no stranger to emergency is he.</i>

1541
01:46:58,679 --> 01:47:01,863
- How's it going, Fred?
- I'm okay.

1542
01:47:03,569 --> 01:47:05,663
What the hell was that?

1543
01:47:06,458 --> 01:47:08,815
Let's hope it was
just the burst disk.

1544
01:47:08,870 --> 01:47:13,082
- Houston, can you confirm a burst helium disk?
- We confirm that, Jim.

1545
01:47:13,124 --> 01:47:17,295
Houston, is that going to
affect our, uh, entry angle at all?

1546
01:47:17,378 --> 01:47:20,631
<i>Uh, negative. Your entry angle
is holding at 6.24, Aquarius.</i>

1547
01:47:21,285 --> 01:47:23,342
Houston, uh...

1548
01:47:24,097 --> 01:47:26,804
we, we sure could use...

1549
01:47:26,846 --> 01:47:29,140
the re-entry procedure up here.

1550
01:47:29,554 --> 01:47:31,350
<i>When can we expect that?</i>

1551
01:47:34,089 --> 01:47:36,314
Uh, that's coming
real soon, Aquarius.

1552
01:47:36,397 --> 01:47:39,067
Uh, Houston, we, we...

1553
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:42,278
We just can't throw this
together at the last minute.

1554
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:44,989
So, here's what you're gonna do.

1555
01:47:45,073 --> 01:47:48,826
You're gonna get the procedure
up to us, whatever it is,

1556
01:47:48,868 --> 01:47:53,539
and we're gonna go over it
step by step, so there's no foul-ups.

1557
01:47:54,138 --> 01:47:57,168
I don't have to tell you
we're all a little tired up here.

1558
01:47:57,251 --> 01:48:00,004
The world's getting awfully big
in the window.

1559
01:48:00,046 --> 01:48:02,548
- Jim, this is Deke.
- It's Deke.

1560
01:48:02,998 --> 01:48:04,884
They don't know how to do it.

1561
01:48:05,677 --> 01:48:10,681
- Maybe Jack's right.
- Hello there, Deke. What's the story?

1562
01:48:10,723 --> 01:48:12,767
Jim, we're gonna get that
power-up procedure to you.

1563
01:48:12,850 --> 01:48:14,811
We're gonna get it
as soon as we possibly can.

1564
01:48:14,852 --> 01:48:17,883
<i>Ken Mattingly's
in the simulator right now.</i>

1565
01:48:19,190 --> 01:48:21,567
Ken's working on it?

1566
01:48:24,453 --> 01:48:26,030
Look...

1567
01:48:26,426 --> 01:48:28,032
I know this sequence works, John.

1568
01:48:28,116 --> 01:48:30,952
The sequence looks good.
We're just over budget on the amperage.

1569
01:48:31,035 --> 01:48:33,413
<i>- By how much?</i>
- Three or four amps.

1570
01:48:33,496 --> 01:48:35,665
Goddamn it, John!
Is it three or four?

1571
01:48:35,707 --> 01:48:37,583
- Four.
- Four!

1572
01:48:38,682 --> 01:48:41,379
Four more amps.

1573
01:48:51,222 --> 01:48:54,058
We know they have some power left
in the LEM batteries, right?

1574
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:55,245
<i>Yeah.</i>

1575
01:48:56,477 --> 01:49:00,565
We have an umbilical that provides power
from the command module to the LEM.

1576
01:49:00,606 --> 01:49:04,110
- Right. It's backup for the LEM power supply.
- I'm listening.

1577
01:49:04,193 --> 01:49:07,066
So... reverse it.

1578
01:49:07,144 --> 01:49:09,285
Reverse the flow and see if
we can draw these four amps...

1579
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:11,019
from the LEM batteries
before we cut it lose.

1580
01:49:11,059 --> 01:49:15,079
- Why can't we do that?
- We don't have a procedure for that, do we?

1581
01:49:15,163 --> 01:49:17,248
You're gonna lose a lot
in the transfer, Ken.

1582
01:49:17,290 --> 01:49:21,252
Yeah, yeah, but all we're
talking about here is four amps.

1583
01:49:22,286 --> 01:49:24,422
I want whatever you guys got
on these power procedures.

1584
01:49:24,505 --> 01:49:27,925
- Gene, they're already...
- I don't want the whole bible, just a couple of chapters.

1585
01:49:28,009 --> 01:49:30,261
- We've got to get something up to these guys.
- They're working on it now.

1586
01:49:30,344 --> 01:49:32,764
- I'll call the simulator and get an estimate.
- Goddamn it!

1587
01:49:32,847 --> 01:49:38,102
I don't want another estimate!
I want the procedures... now!

1588
01:49:49,730 --> 01:49:51,019
IMU is up.

1589
01:49:52,178 --> 01:49:55,084
<i>- How am I reading?</i>
- Fine, so far.

1590
01:49:55,162 --> 01:49:57,121
<i>- Say again.</i>
- You're under the limit. Keep going.

1591
01:49:57,163 --> 01:50:00,416
Okay. Floodlights to fixed.

1592
01:50:02,776 --> 01:50:06,130
<i>Okay, I'm bringing up the guidance.</i>

1593
01:50:08,093 --> 01:50:09,328
Here we go.

1594
01:50:10,802 --> 01:50:12,755
CMC attitude IMU.

1595
01:50:13,895 --> 01:50:15,932
<i>CMC source.</i>

1596
01:50:16,411 --> 01:50:20,353
CMC mode, auto,
and we're on the computer.

1597
01:50:28,299 --> 01:50:29,779
Ken?

1598
01:50:29,821 --> 01:50:32,990
<i>- Go ahead.</i>
- Is your computer on now?

1599
01:50:33,074 --> 01:50:37,412
Up and running.
How do we look?

1600
01:50:42,589 --> 01:50:44,128
John?

1601
01:50:47,285 --> 01:50:48,840
I think we got it, buddy.

1602
01:50:59,183 --> 01:51:01,644
Arthur, my notes are clear
on that last sequence, right?

1603
01:51:01,686 --> 01:51:03,146
Yeah.

1604
01:51:03,187 --> 01:51:05,627
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- I was getting a little blurry there.

1605
01:51:09,193 --> 01:51:11,654
Here's Ken. Here's John.

1606
01:51:12,602 --> 01:51:14,242
It's good to see you, Ken.

1607
01:51:15,086 --> 01:51:15,992
This is the sequence.

1608
01:51:16,352 --> 01:51:18,494
- Was it tried on the hardware yet?
- We didn't have time.

1609
01:51:20,538 --> 01:51:23,332
Aquarius, Houston.
<i>Do you read?</i>

1610
01:51:24,092 --> 01:51:27,503
Yeah, we read you, Ken.

1611
01:51:28,272 --> 01:51:30,423
Are the flowers blooming in Houston?

1612
01:51:30,702 --> 01:51:35,386
Uh, that's a negative, Jim.
I don't have the measles.

1613
01:51:39,208 --> 01:51:41,350
<i>Jim, is Jack in there with you?</i>

1614
01:51:41,668 --> 01:51:44,854
Uh, yeah, stand by one.
We gotta get him on comm.

1615
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:47,857
- Put those on the table.
- Oh, damn it. Thanks, Jackie.

1616
01:51:47,899 --> 01:51:50,193
I think it would
really help if you could...

1617
01:51:50,234 --> 01:51:54,864
just distract her when
the heavy predictions come in.

1618
01:51:54,906 --> 01:51:57,700
- Yeah, yeah. We'll give it a shot.
- Thanks.

1619
01:51:58,429 --> 01:51:59,702
Blanch.

1620
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:03,289
Blanch, these nice, young men
are gonna watch the television with you.

1621
01:52:03,372 --> 01:52:06,295
This is Neil Armstrong,
and this is Buzz Aldrin.

1622
01:52:06,374 --> 01:52:07,126
Nice to meet you.

1623
01:52:07,210 --> 01:52:12,465
- Hi.
- Are you boys in the space program too?

1624
01:52:12,915 --> 01:52:16,719
Okay, Jack, give me a read-back
on that last procedure.

1625
01:52:16,761 --> 01:52:18,516
Uh, stand by, Ken.

1626
01:52:22,204 --> 01:52:26,479
Ken, I'm having trouble
reading my own writing.

1627
01:52:26,562 --> 01:52:30,149
I guess I was a little
more tired than I thought.

1628
01:52:34,914 --> 01:52:37,542
Uh, don't worry, Jack.
I'll talk you through it.

1629
01:52:40,243 --> 01:52:43,371
Okay, find the main
bus breakers on panel 11.

1630
01:52:45,934 --> 01:52:46,791
Yeah, main bus breakers.

1631
01:52:46,874 --> 01:52:48,960
- Got it.
<i>- Close main bus B.</i>

1632
01:52:57,388 --> 01:53:00,805
Ken, there's an awful lot
of condensation on these panels.

1633
01:53:01,355 --> 01:53:03,815
What's the word on these
things shorting out?

1634
01:53:08,427 --> 01:53:11,721
Uh, we'll just take that
one at a time, Jack.

1635
01:53:13,359 --> 01:53:17,155
It's like tryin' to drive
a toaster through a car wash.

1636
01:53:25,029 --> 01:53:26,748
<i>Main bus B is closed.</i>

1637
01:53:26,831 --> 01:53:29,625
<i>Okay, Thirteen, we're coming up
on entry interface.</i>

1638
01:53:30,315 --> 01:53:33,463
Flight, we're still shallowing up
a bit in the re-entry corridor.

1639
01:53:33,504 --> 01:53:35,673
It's almost like
they're underweight.

1640
01:53:35,757 --> 01:53:40,803
- Now how could they be underweight?
- We didn't land on the moon.

1641
01:53:40,845 --> 01:53:43,389
- Rocks?
- That's affirm.

1642
01:53:43,621 --> 01:53:45,391
<i>Uh, one more thing, Jim.</i>

1643
01:53:45,475 --> 01:53:47,935
<i>While Jack's working on the power-up,
we'd like you and Freddo...</i>

1644
01:53:48,019 --> 01:53:50,688
<i>to transfer some ballast
over to the command module.</i>

1645
01:53:50,730 --> 01:53:52,690
Uh, say again, Houston.
Ballast?

1646
01:53:52,774 --> 01:53:56,027
Um, that's affirm.
We got to get the weight right.

1647
01:53:56,110 --> 01:53:59,822
We were expecting you to be toting
a couple hundred pounds of moon rocks.

1648
01:53:59,863 --> 01:54:01,717
Right.

1649
01:54:01,772 --> 01:54:04,035
<i>- Now, Jack.</i>
- Yeah, go ahead, Ken.

1650
01:54:04,248 --> 01:54:07,205
<i>Okay, now, uh, panel five.</i>

1651
01:54:07,288 --> 01:54:12,210
<i>Circuit breaker caution
and warning main B closed.</i>

1652
01:54:12,251 --> 01:54:14,754
Main B closed.

1653
01:54:15,462 --> 01:54:17,423
Master alarm off.

1654
01:54:17,507 --> 01:54:21,594
Okay, Jack, uh, on panel seven,
B-MAG number two, power to warm-up.

1655
01:54:21,677 --> 01:54:24,263
B-MAG number two,
power to warm-up done.

1656
01:54:24,761 --> 01:54:27,350
<i>Sequential logic one and two on.</i>

1657
01:54:27,392 --> 01:54:30,061
Sequential logic... two on.

1658
01:54:30,642 --> 01:54:33,335
<i>CMRCS pressure on.</i>

1659
01:54:33,437 --> 01:54:35,525
CMRCS pressurization.

1660
01:54:35,569 --> 01:54:39,028
As her husband prepares to jettison
his lunar module lifeboat,

1661
01:54:39,070 --> 01:54:41,796
Marilyn Lovell waits with her
children, her neighbours...

1662
01:54:41,866 --> 01:54:46,744
and, we are told, Apollo 11 astronauts
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.

1663
01:54:46,828 --> 01:54:49,497
Only the Lovell's eldest son,
Jay, is absent...

1664
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:51,499
as he holds vigil
with his classmates...

1665
01:54:51,582 --> 01:54:55,211
at the St. Johns Military Academy
in Wisconsin.

1666
01:54:55,253 --> 01:54:57,963
<i>ABC News science editor
Jules Bergman.</i>

1667
01:54:58,049 --> 01:55:01,801
<i>With a crippled command module, and
surviving by using the LEM's systems,</i>

1668
01:55:01,884 --> 01:55:03,803
<i>there can be no easy manoeuvre.</i>

1669
01:55:03,886 --> 01:55:07,056
<i>And their LEM lifeboat is doing things
and working longer...</i>

1670
01:55:07,098 --> 01:55:08,865
<i>than it was ever intended to.</i>

1671
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:11,561
<i>It's a race against time
until splashdown.</i>

1672
01:55:11,601 --> 01:55:14,459
<i>Okay, Jack, we're ready to see
if the computer will accept...</i>

1673
01:55:14,498 --> 01:55:19,444
<i>- uplink of the re-entry data now.</i>
- Okay, the IMU is up.

1674
01:55:19,477 --> 01:55:22,006
- We got our eight-balls back.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

1675
01:55:22,091 --> 01:55:27,583
Okay, Ken, uh, uplink telemetry,
command module to accept, right?

1676
01:55:27,615 --> 01:55:31,956
That's affirm.
Go ahead and try it.

1677
01:55:32,693 --> 01:55:34,042
Come on.

1678
01:55:50,995 --> 01:55:52,237
Uplink completed.

1679
01:55:58,182 --> 01:55:59,604
- Yeah. That's more like it.
- We're back in business.

1680
01:55:59,658 --> 01:56:00,985
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's go.

1681
01:56:01,069 --> 01:56:03,112
Take a look at your amps. How we doin'?

1682
01:56:06,008 --> 01:56:08,201
We got her back up, Ken.

1683
01:56:08,867 --> 01:56:10,495
Boy, I wish
you were here to see it.

1684
01:56:10,578 --> 01:56:12,625
I'll bet you do.

1685
01:56:15,477 --> 01:56:17,585
Way to go, Jack.

1686
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:24,467
- Flight, this is RETRO.
<i>- Go, RETRO.</i>

1687
01:56:24,509 --> 01:56:27,011
Flight, we are looking
at a typhoon warning...

1688
01:56:27,095 --> 01:56:30,306
<i>- on the edge of the prime recovery zone.</i>
- Say again, RETRO.

1689
01:56:30,347 --> 01:56:34,546
<i>Flight, we are looking at a typhoon warning</i>
on the edge of the prime recovery area.

1690
01:56:34,594 --> 01:56:37,063
Now this is just a warning, Flight.
It could miss them.

1691
01:56:37,146 --> 01:56:39,691
Only if their luck changes.

1692
01:56:39,719 --> 01:56:42,318
Jim, we're ready
for SM jettison!

1693
01:56:43,281 --> 01:56:45,905
All right, Jack, on three!

1694
01:56:46,511 --> 01:56:49,136
One... two...

1695
01:56:49,167 --> 01:56:52,370
- upward thrust.
- We're loose!

1696
01:56:52,453 --> 01:56:54,497
Reverse thrust!

1697
01:56:54,948 --> 01:56:56,666
<i>We have service module jettison.</i>

1698
01:56:56,926 --> 01:56:59,669
<i>Okay, Houston,
service module is free.</i>

1699
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:01,838
<i>We're gonna take a look
at what we have here.</i>

1700
01:57:01,879 --> 01:57:03,923
<i>Copy that.</i>

1701
01:57:07,677 --> 01:57:10,012
There it is. I see it!

1702
01:57:10,936 --> 01:57:12,932
Oh.

1703
01:57:13,015 --> 01:57:16,602
Houston, we're getting our first look
at the service module now.

1704
01:57:16,686 --> 01:57:20,440
One whole side
of the spacecraft is missing.

1705
01:57:21,022 --> 01:57:24,444
<i>Right by the high gain antennae
a whole panel is blown out,</i>

1706
01:57:25,237 --> 01:57:28,614
<i>right up, right up
to our heat shield.</i>

1707
01:57:29,557 --> 01:57:31,284
Uh, copy that, Aquarius.

1708
01:57:31,366 --> 01:57:34,161
It looked like it got
the engine bell too. Can you see that?

1709
01:57:38,881 --> 01:57:40,918
Oh, man, that's incredible.

1710
01:57:44,420 --> 01:57:45,590
The heat shield.

1711
01:57:45,624 --> 01:57:51,471
<i>The heat will build up to as much
as 3,000 or 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

1712
01:57:51,794 --> 01:57:53,927
<i>On a lunar re-entry flight,
the heat approaches 4,000 degrees.</i>

1713
01:57:53,950 --> 01:57:55,600
So, uh, Blanch?

1714
01:57:55,641 --> 01:57:59,645
Blanch? Did Jim make
Eagle Scout or not?

1715
01:57:59,729 --> 01:58:01,773
- Yes, he did.
- He did.

1716
01:58:01,856 --> 01:58:04,108
<i>If the heat shield
is even slightly cracked,</i>

1717
01:58:04,150 --> 01:58:06,778
<i>the extreme cold
could have split it wide open.</i>

1718
01:58:07,076 --> 01:58:10,114
<i>Worst of all, if the pyrotechnics
that control the parachutes...</i>

1719
01:58:10,156 --> 01:58:12,950
<i>have been damaged,
the chutes may not open at all,</i>

1720
01:58:12,992 --> 01:58:16,829
<i>causing the spacecraft to hit the water
not at a gentle 20 miles per hour,</i>

1721
01:58:17,155 --> 01:58:19,332
<i>but at a suicidal 300.</i>

1722
01:58:19,415 --> 01:58:21,334
<i>Perhaps never in human history...</i>

1723
01:58:21,417 --> 01:58:25,230
<i>has the entire world been united
by such a global drama.</i>

1724
01:58:25,347 --> 01:58:27,799
<i>In New York City, thousands
of people have gathered...</i>

1725
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:30,676
<i>to watch updates of the mission
in Times Square.</i>

1726
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:33,471
<i>Many countries offered help,
and the State Department said...</i>

1727
01:58:33,554 --> 01:58:35,807
<i>it would ask for it
if it were needed.</i>

1728
01:58:35,848 --> 01:58:38,893
<i>The House and Senate passed resolutions
calling on the American people...</i>

1729
01:58:38,976 --> 01:58:41,312
<i>to pray tonight
for the astronauts.</i>

1730
01:58:41,395 --> 01:58:44,356
<i>In Rome, Pope Paul
led 50,000 people...</i>

1731
01:58:44,403 --> 01:58:47,527
<i>in prayers for the safe
return of the astronauts.</i>

1732
01:58:47,610 --> 01:58:49,987
<i>In Jerusalem,
prayers at the Wailing Wall.</i>

1733
01:58:55,827 --> 01:58:59,163
Uh, it's about time to bail
out of this ship, Freddo.

1734
01:59:03,042 --> 01:59:05,002
Freddo?

1735
01:59:06,170 --> 01:59:08,381
You okay?

1736
01:59:08,464 --> 01:59:11,718
I'm, uh... I'm freezing.

1737
01:59:13,581 --> 01:59:16,472
Can you hold out
just a little longer?

1738
01:59:16,514 --> 01:59:19,767
- Long as I have to.
- Aw, come on.

1739
01:59:19,851 --> 01:59:23,771
It won't be long.
Just a little while longer, Freddo.

1740
01:59:25,815 --> 01:59:30,695
Just a little while longer. We're gonna
hit that water in the South Pacific.

1741
01:59:31,106 --> 01:59:34,198
Open up that hatch.

1742
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:38,745
- It's 80 degrees out there.
- Eighty degrees.

1743
01:59:40,121 --> 01:59:44,584
- You are a mess.
- Y-Yeah.

1744
01:59:45,541 --> 01:59:48,129
<i>Odyssey, Houston.
Uh, how we doin', guys?</i>

1745
01:59:48,212 --> 01:59:50,506
<i>We're closing in
on lunar module jettison.</i>

1746
01:59:50,547 --> 01:59:52,956
<i>As you know,
that is time critical.</i>

1747
01:59:53,057 --> 01:59:55,470
<i>We should be making our move
in the command module.</i>

1748
01:59:55,553 --> 01:59:57,128
<i>Let's get that hatch
buttoned up,</i>

1749
01:59:57,174 --> 02:00:00,253
<i>and, when you get a chance,
let us know how you're doing.</i>

1750
02:00:00,332 --> 02:00:01,750
Roger that.

1751
02:00:04,841 --> 02:00:07,065
Here. Let me give you a hand there, Freddo.

1752
02:00:42,392 --> 02:00:45,228
<i>We're coming up on LEM jettison.</i>

1753
02:00:45,269 --> 02:00:47,772
Is everyone strapped in, Ken?
We're getting real close.

1754
02:00:47,814 --> 02:00:52,568
Uh, copy that, Flight. Uh, Thirteen, Houston.
Uh, we're coming up on LEM jettison.

1755
02:00:52,610 --> 02:00:54,779
Stand by.

1756
02:00:55,697 --> 02:00:57,615
<i>Have you got everybody
in the Odyssey?</i>

1757
02:00:57,657 --> 02:01:00,952
Yeah, Ken, I'm gonna check those
pyro batteries one more time here.

1758
02:01:02,300 --> 02:01:03,621
Okay, the pyro batts look good.

1759
02:01:03,663 --> 02:01:06,874
I don't think we're gonna
have to tie the other batteries.

1760
02:01:19,178 --> 02:01:21,639
Sorry, Jack,
this is an old habit.

1761
02:01:21,723 --> 02:01:24,934
I'm kind of used to the pilot's seat.
She's yours to fly.

1762
02:01:30,522 --> 02:01:33,740
<i>Okay, Odyssey, I want to double check
some re-entry procedures...</i>

1763
02:01:33,803 --> 02:01:38,656
<i>right after we jettison the LEM,
which is coming up in 30 seconds.</i>

1764
02:01:38,740 --> 02:01:40,950
What is that?

1765
02:01:40,992 --> 02:01:43,226
Oh, I was getting
a little punchy,

1766
02:01:43,265 --> 02:01:47,165
and I didn't want to cut the LEM loose
with you guys still in it.

1767
02:01:48,255 --> 02:01:49,687
That's good thinking.

1768
02:01:52,328 --> 02:01:53,880
Stand by, Houston.

1769
02:01:56,466 --> 02:01:59,260
<i>We have lunar module jettison.</i>

1770
02:02:07,035 --> 02:02:09,062
She sure was a good ship.

1771
02:02:10,438 --> 02:02:14,525
<i>Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you.</i>

1772
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:23,888
Mary?

1773
02:02:23,999 --> 02:02:26,607
It's almost time, honey.

1774
02:02:29,707 --> 02:02:31,751
Flight 966406.

1775
02:02:52,828 --> 02:02:54,094
Let me put it this way.

1776
02:02:54,154 --> 02:02:56,531
The trajectory may be off.
Their thrusters may be frozen.

1777
02:02:56,693 --> 02:02:59,297
Their guidance system
might be malfunctioning.

1778
02:02:59,343 --> 02:03:00,779
Their heat shield could be cracked.

1779
02:03:00,863 --> 02:03:04,117
And their parachutes
might be three blocks of ice.

1780
02:03:04,199 --> 02:03:05,856
Clearly, we have
some obstacles to overcome.

1781
02:03:05,903 --> 02:03:09,664
Yeah, okay, but now I'm asking you,
when will we know?

1782
02:03:09,747 --> 02:03:11,692
Well, blackout lasts
for three minutes.

1783
02:03:11,762 --> 02:03:15,512
If they're not back
in four, we'll know.

1784
02:03:16,629 --> 02:03:20,513
Velocity now reading
34,802 feet per second.

1785
02:03:20,584 --> 02:03:23,803
- Range to go <i>2,625 nautical miles.</i>
- Copy that.

1786
02:03:24,662 --> 02:03:27,014
Okay, Ken,
we are aligned for re-entry.

1787
02:03:27,098 --> 02:03:29,279
Jim, we're going to need
that computer re-entry program.

1788
02:03:29,334 --> 02:03:34,188
- Fred, how are the batteries looking?
- Okay. Batt A looks good.

1789
02:03:34,272 --> 02:03:36,357
<i>Re-entry interface in one minute...</i>

1790
02:03:36,441 --> 02:03:40,611
- Batt B, no volts, the amps are okay.
<i>- And 30 seconds.</i>

1791
02:03:41,155 --> 02:03:42,991
Batt C...

1792
02:03:43,405 --> 02:03:46,492
shit, no volts, only two amps.

1793
02:03:46,576 --> 02:03:49,162
It may die before
the main chutes open.

1794
02:03:49,544 --> 02:03:52,380
Roger. Let's tie all the batteries
onto main A and main B.

1795
02:03:52,457 --> 02:03:56,002
Flight, they're still shallowing a bit
up there. Do you want to tell 'em?

1796
02:03:56,975 --> 02:03:59,881
- Is there anything we can do about it?
<i>- Not now, Flight.</i>

1797
02:03:59,964 --> 02:04:02,341
- Then they don't need to know, do they?
<i>- Copy that.</i>

1798
02:04:02,425 --> 02:04:04,844
RETRO says the typhoon is still
a presence in the splashdown area?

1799
02:04:04,927 --> 02:04:09,140
- Yeah.
- We got the parachute situation,

1800
02:04:09,182 --> 02:04:11,501
the heat shield, the angle
of trajectory and the typhoon.

1801
02:04:11,539 --> 02:04:12,985
There's just so many variables,
I'm a little at a loss...

1802
02:04:13,079 --> 02:04:15,563
I know what the problems are, Henry.

1803
02:04:15,646 --> 02:04:18,024
This could be the worst disaster
NASA's ever experienced.

1804
02:04:18,806 --> 02:04:23,654
With all due respect, sir, I believe
this is going to be our finest hour.

1805
02:04:36,210 --> 02:04:39,670
Expect entry interface
in 45 seconds.

1806
02:04:39,754 --> 02:04:41,964
And on my mark, your velocity...

1807
02:04:42,006 --> 02:04:46,761
<i>will be 35,245 feet per second.</i>

1808
02:04:46,844 --> 02:04:50,306
<i>Mark 35 seconds
to entry interface.</i>

1809
02:04:52,530 --> 02:04:53,771
Gentlemen...

1810
02:04:56,688 --> 02:04:59,399
it's been a privilege
flying with you.

1811
02:05:41,351 --> 02:05:43,192
Flight, we have loss
of radio contact.

1812
02:05:43,476 --> 02:05:44,569
Roger that.

1813
02:05:44,792 --> 02:05:47,336
Expect to regain signal
in three minutes.

1814
02:05:50,795 --> 02:05:52,744
It all depends
on the heat shield.

1815
02:06:25,990 --> 02:06:28,591
<i>Back to the Iwo Jima
and our live cameras there.</i>

1816
02:06:29,114 --> 02:06:32,283
<i>The Navy recovery and rescue
helicopters already airborne,</i>

1817
02:06:32,367 --> 02:06:34,700
<i>circling, waiting
for first radar contact.</i>

1818
02:06:34,794 --> 02:06:38,236
<i>Coming up now on three minutes
until time of drogue deployment.</i>

1819
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:43,976
<i>Standing by for any reports
of acquisition.</i>

1820
02:06:47,548 --> 02:06:51,469
One minute and 30 seconds
to end of blackout.

1821
02:06:56,106 --> 02:06:58,518
<i>No re-entering ship
has ever taken longer...</i>

1822
02:06:58,601 --> 02:07:01,574
<i>than three minutes
to emerge from blackout.</i>

1823
02:07:01,637 --> 02:07:05,582
<i>This is the critical moment.
Will the heat shield hold?</i>

1824
02:07:05,691 --> 02:07:09,278
<i>Will the command module survive
the intense heat of re-entry?</i>

1825
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:12,281
<i>If it doesn't,
there'll only be silence.</i>

1826
02:07:12,314 --> 02:07:15,776
- Mommy, you're squishing me.
- Oops, sorry, sweetie.

1827
02:07:33,489 --> 02:07:35,805
Okay, Flight,
that's three minutes.

1828
02:07:35,847 --> 02:07:39,308
- We are standing by for acquisition.
- Copy that.

1829
02:07:40,768 --> 02:07:43,813
Odyssey, Houston. Do you read me?

1830
02:07:43,855 --> 02:07:45,857
Odyssey, this is Houston.
Do you read?

1831
02:07:45,940 --> 02:07:48,354
<i>Expected time of reacquisition,</i>

1832
02:07:48,549 --> 02:07:52,533
<i>the time when the astronauts were
expected to come out of blackout,</i>

1833
02:07:52,759 --> 02:07:56,038
<i>has come and gone.</i>

1834
02:07:56,179 --> 02:08:00,204
<i>About all any of us can do now
is just listen and hope.</i>

1835
02:08:00,288 --> 02:08:02,687
<i>We're about to learn whether
or not that heat shield,</i>

1836
02:08:02,717 --> 02:08:06,170
<i>which was damaged, as you remember,
by the explosion three days ago,</i>

1837
02:08:06,335 --> 02:08:09,005
<i>has withstood
the inferno of re-entry.</i>

1838
02:08:13,237 --> 02:08:15,970
Odyssey, this is Houston.
Do you read me?

1839
02:08:18,473 --> 02:08:21,059
Odyssey, Houston.
Do you read?

1840
02:08:22,380 --> 02:08:25,103
Three minutes, 30 seconds. Standing by.

1841
02:08:25,764 --> 02:08:29,108
Odyssey, Houston. Do you read?

1842
02:08:35,947 --> 02:08:39,994
Odyssey, this is Houston.
Do you read me?

1843
02:08:42,914 --> 02:08:45,792
That's four minutes.
Standing by.

1844
02:09:07,925 --> 02:09:10,441
Odyssey, uh, Houston. Do you read?

1845
02:09:18,675 --> 02:09:20,761
<i>Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey.</i>

1846
02:09:20,798 --> 02:09:24,176
<i>It's good to see you again.</i>

1847
02:09:46,672 --> 02:09:49,313
Odyssey, Houston.
Welcome home.

1848
02:09:49,355 --> 02:09:51,649
We're glad to see you.

1849
02:09:51,691 --> 02:09:54,652
- Good job, Ken. Good job.
- Thank you.

1850
02:10:38,658 --> 02:10:41,532
They made it. They made it.

1851
02:10:52,873 --> 02:10:54,818
- Yeah!
- Lunney.

1852
02:11:23,126 --> 02:11:26,492
Houston, we're at stable one.
The ship is secure.

1853
02:11:27,189 --> 02:11:29,280
This is Apollo 13 signing off.

1854
02:11:29,682 --> 02:11:30,869
Good job.

1855
02:12:23,072 --> 02:12:25,416
<i>Our mission was called
a successful failure,</i>

1856
02:12:25,525 --> 02:12:28,348
<i>in that we returned safely,
but never made it to the moon.</i>

1857
02:12:29,549 --> 02:12:31,603
<i>In the following months,
it was determined...</i>

1858
02:12:31,697 --> 02:12:34,812
<i>that a damaged coil built
inside the oxygen tank...</i>

1859
02:12:35,189 --> 02:12:39,484
<i>sparked during our cryo stir and caused
the explosion that crippled the Odyssey.</i>

1860
02:12:40,126 --> 02:12:42,376
<i>It was a minor defect
that occurred two years...</i>

1861
02:12:42,399 --> 02:12:45,156
<i>before I was even named
the flight's commander.</i>

1862
02:12:45,493 --> 02:12:48,826
<i>Fred Haise was going back
to the moon on Apollo 18,</i>

1863
02:12:49,094 --> 02:12:51,162
<i>but his mission was cancelled
because of budget cuts.</i>

1864
02:12:51,245 --> 02:12:53,206
<i>He never flew in space again.</i>

1865
02:12:53,734 --> 02:12:56,501
<i>Nor did Jack Swigert,
who left the astronaut corps...</i>

1866
02:12:56,584 --> 02:12:59,670
<i>and was elected to Congress
from the state of Colorado.</i>

1867
02:12:59,974 --> 02:13:03,005
<i>But he died of cancer before
he was able to take office.</i>

1868
02:13:04,193 --> 02:13:07,970
<i>Ken Mattingly orbited the moon
as command module pilot of Apollo 16...</i>

1869
02:13:08,192 --> 02:13:11,849
<i>and flew the space shuttle,
having never gotten the measles.</i>

1870
02:13:12,738 --> 02:13:17,355
<i>Gene Kranz retired as Director
of Flight Operations just not long ago.</i>

1871
02:13:17,438 --> 02:13:20,316
<i>And many other members of Mission
Control have gone on to other things,</i>

1872
02:13:20,573 --> 02:13:22,360
<i>but some are still there.</i>

1873
02:13:23,566 --> 02:13:25,154
<i>And as for me...</i>

1874
02:13:25,448 --> 02:13:30,159
<i>the seven extraordinary days
of Apollo 13 were my last in space.</i>

1875
02:13:30,612 --> 02:13:34,831
<i>I watched other men walk on the moon
and return safely,</i>

1876
02:13:35,144 --> 02:13:39,544
<i>all from the confines of Mission Control
and our house in Houston.</i>

1877
02:13:40,558 --> 02:13:42,839
<i>I sometimes catch myself
looking up at the moon,</i>

1878
02:13:43,230 --> 02:13:46,342
<i>remembering the changes
of fortune in our long voyage,</i>

1879
02:13:46,941 --> 02:13:51,848
<i>thinking of the thousands of people who
worked to bring the three of us home.</i>

1880
02:13:52,287 --> 02:13:55,018
<i>I look up at the moon
and wonder...</i>

1881
02:13:55,482 --> 02:13:57,687
<i>when will we be going back...</i>

1882
02:13:58,209 --> 02:13:59,935
<i>and who will that be?</i>
