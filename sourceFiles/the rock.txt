1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:13,000

2
00:00:42,889 --> 00:00:45,391
We can't hold out much longer, sir.

3
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,568
General Hummel, you've got
to get us out of here now!

4
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,801
I won't let you down.
I won't let you down, son.

5
00:01:24,597 --> 00:01:27,517
Goddamn it, sir!
How long do we have to wait?

6
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,498
I've lost 15 men already!

7
00:01:29,602 --> 00:01:32,730
Sir, they're lighting us up
like a firestorm!

8
00:01:32,887 --> 00:01:36,015
This is Gen. Hummel.
You gotta get my men outta there!

9
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,726
We don't have clearance
to go behind enemy lines, sir.

10
00:01:41,593 --> 00:01:44,565
They're not comin'
for us, are they, sir?

11
00:01:53,063 --> 00:01:57,599
Congressman Weaver and esteemed members
of the Special Armed Services Committee,

12
00:01:57,807 --> 00:02:01,092
I come before you
to protest a grave injustice.

13
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:14,126
Aim!

14
00:02:14,178 --> 00:02:17,358
It has to stop.

15
00:03:00,578 --> 00:03:02,872
I miss you so much.

16
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,489
There's somethin'
I've gotta do, Barb.

17
00:03:15,593 --> 00:03:18,826
Somethin' I couldn't do
while you were here.

18
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,172
I tried.

19
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:25,864
You know I tried everything,
and I still don't have their attention.

20
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:31,547
Let's hope this elevates
their thinking.

21
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,102
But whatever happens...

22
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,481
please don't think less of me.

23
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:25,246
Marine! Inform the garrison C.O.
that Gen. Hummel's coming on board...

24
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:27,801
- with a security inspection team.
- Yes, sir.

25
00:04:27,853 --> 00:04:30,721
Sir, it's an honor having you, sir.

26
00:04:45,475 --> 00:04:47,613
Aah!

27
00:04:56,371 --> 00:04:59,864
- Uuh!
- Oof!

28
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,263
Ya know, at least we can get some--

29
00:05:05,547 --> 00:05:10,604
- Yeah, I'll tell ya-- Uuh!
- Ooh!

30
00:05:10,656 --> 00:05:14,514
- Aah! Aah!

31
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:16,131
Uuh!

32
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:25,359
I got the access card. We got
30 minutes 'til those darts wear off.

33
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:26,871
Move it!

34
00:05:30,676 --> 00:05:32,605
The access card, sir.

35
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,881
Let's do it.

36
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:44,597
Twenty-four hundred
magazine check.

37
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:02,844
- Man, it's wet out there.
- Check me through, will ya?

38
00:06:12,593 --> 00:06:15,200
Clear!

39
00:06:41,372 --> 00:06:43,979
- I want 16, Major.
- Move it!

40
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,322
- Evac! Seal the door!
- No! No!

41
00:07:14,374 --> 00:07:16,720
Come on, man, seal it! Seal it!

42
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:19,379
No-o-o!

43
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,123
Lemme outta here! Oh, God!
Lemme outta here! Oh, God!

44
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:26,313
Lemme outta here! God!

45
00:07:26,365 --> 00:07:30,432
Clear out.
Get outta here!

46
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:38,304
- Please!
- Sorry.

47
00:07:45,551 --> 00:07:47,480
Let's move out.

48
00:07:59,106 --> 00:08:01,609
Two more CCs of acetylene chloride.

49
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:06,979
That'll be five dollars,
Isherwood.

50
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:09,846
You suck.

51
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:18,970
You guys have too much time
on your hands.

52
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:23,453
Yes! She's here.
Bring it to me now. Thank you, Phil.

53
00:08:23,558 --> 00:08:26,060
What's that?
Why'd you get it sent here?

54
00:08:26,112 --> 00:08:31,065
Carla wouldn't approve. She thinks
it's dumb to spend $600 on an L.P.

55
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:35,132
Carla's right. Why don't you just
spend $13.00 on a CD, man?

56
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:37,738
First of all,
it's because I'm a Beatlemaniac.

57
00:08:37,843 --> 00:08:40,189
And second, these sound better.

58
00:08:40,293 --> 00:08:42,848
- Could be serious.

59
00:08:43,004 --> 00:08:45,350
Could be sarin gas.

60
00:08:47,801 --> 00:08:50,616
Dog out at J.F.K. caught a whiff
of something in this package...

61
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:52,597
postmarked
to a Bosnian refugee camp.

62
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:55,569
It could be detergent;
it could be sarin gas.

63
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:57,550
Bosnian refugee camp?

64
00:08:57,602 --> 00:09:00,939
Half a million Serbians reside in
the U.S. Serbians don't like Bosnians.

65
00:09:01,043 --> 00:09:03,285
You guys wanna get suited up?

66
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:09,906
- Bring the cockroaches?
- Got 'em.

67
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:12,096
We have airlock, Stanley.
You're all set to go.

68
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:21,011
October 1, 0900 hours.

69
00:09:21,115 --> 00:09:24,817
Agent Stanley Goodspeed,
Agent Trainee Marvin Isherwood...

70
00:09:24,921 --> 00:09:27,059
initiating exam of wooden crate.

71
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:30,917
Suspicion of sarin gas inside.

72
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:33,158
- Marvin, sarin is a--
- G.B. aerosol.

73
00:09:33,315 --> 00:09:36,808
That is correct.
I see we have some dirty magazines.

74
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,092
Stone Age Cavegirls In the Raw.
Kinky.

75
00:09:40,197 --> 00:09:43,533
And, uh-- Not a good sign.

76
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,600
Helloo-oo-oo, little baby doll.
Look it, Stan.

77
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:51,093
- Hi, there, Stanley!
- Marvin, don't!

78
00:09:51,302 --> 00:09:52,866
- Hiya, Stan!

79
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,619
Shit! Move back!
Move back!

80
00:09:56,724 --> 00:09:59,278
- Power landings offed.
- Hang on, guys.

81
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:01,885
We'll have that room cleared
in 50 seconds. You're going to be okay.

82
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:04,231
Jesus Christ!

83
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:08,037
Okay, I've got some bad news
and some really bad news.

84
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:12,469
The bad news is that the gas is
corrosive and it's eating our suits.

85
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,701
- It's all over my hand, man.
- The really bad news...

86
00:10:15,805 --> 00:10:19,507
is there's enough C-4 explosive and
poison gas to blow the whole chamber...

87
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:21,488
- and kill everybody in the building.
- Detonation too heavy.

88
00:10:21,592 --> 00:10:23,886
- Everybody, out of the room, now!
- Seal us inside.

89
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,664
Where are the sprinklers,
Lonner?

90
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,669
The acid's eating my su-- It's eating
my fucking suit, all right? Shit.

91
00:10:35,825 --> 00:10:39,162
Just wash us off.
Where are my sprinklers?

92
00:10:39,318 --> 00:10:41,091
We're working on it.
It's just a flow problem.

93
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:43,854
Well, it's a pretty big friggin'
problem, Lonner. Fix it now!

94
00:10:43,906 --> 00:10:46,096
We're working on it! How much time
do you have on that detonator?

95
00:10:46,252 --> 00:10:48,129
- A minute, ten.
- Hey, look at this!

96
00:10:48,234 --> 00:10:50,632
We're gonna have the room clear.

97
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:52,717
- Tell 'em to take the atropine, now.
- The atropine, Isherwood.

98
00:10:52,874 --> 00:10:55,533
- What?
- Where's my water? One minute!

99
00:10:55,637 --> 00:11:00,173
Marvin, the atropine! Inject it
in your heart before your suit melts.

100
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:02,571
Shh-it!

101
00:11:02,623 --> 00:11:06,116
- Make him take his dose!
- Where's that water?

102
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:11,069
- Get that away from me!
- Come on, Phil, fix it,
for Christ's sake!

103
00:11:11,121 --> 00:11:15,031
- Take the atropine now,
Stan, for Christ's sake!
- We're fucked.

104
00:11:15,135 --> 00:11:18,889
- Poison's mixing.
- What the fuck are you waiting for?

105
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:23,060
- You take the fucking needle now!
- Fucking shit, oh fucking shit--

106
00:11:23,112 --> 00:11:25,615
- Forty seconds!
- If that suit melts--

107
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:28,117
If you die, we all die!
Inject your heart...

108
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:30,620
- and then diffuse the bomb!
- Come on, just do it, Stan!

109
00:11:30,672 --> 00:11:33,122
Shit, what if I miss my heart?
I can't see shit!

110
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,781
- Do it now!
- Look how big this is.

111
00:11:35,885 --> 00:11:39,535
You want me to stick this into
my heart? Are you fucking nuts?

112
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,829
The sprinkler's coming.
It's coming.

113
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:44,175
Okay, here we go, man!

114
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,763
Sprinkler activated!

115
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:50,744
How much time left?

116
00:11:50,848 --> 00:11:53,924
Twenty seconds.

117
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:56,218
We're not gonna make it.

118
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,503
- Fifteen.

119
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,299
Oh, come on!

120
00:12:04,351 --> 00:12:06,697
Clear!

121
00:12:08,783 --> 00:12:11,129
Get me the fuck out
of this gas chamber.

122
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:14,257
I almost stabbed myself
in the heart with this thing!

123
00:12:14,361 --> 00:12:17,385
-# Please lock me away #

124
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:19,888
- Stan?
- Hey, darlin'.

125
00:12:19,992 --> 00:12:23,694
-# And don't allow the day here inside #
-Hi, baby.

126
00:12:23,798 --> 00:12:27,030
# Where I hide with my loneliness #

127
00:12:27,135 --> 00:12:29,168
I had such
an interesting day today.

128
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:32,035
- # I don't care what they say #
- Yeah, I had kind of
an interesting day myself.

129
00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:35,216
- Okay, you go first.

130
00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:39,282
Oh, just some terrorists decide to send
a little care package-- box o' goodies--

131
00:12:39,386 --> 00:12:43,974
- which had to be neutralized
before blowing up the office.

132
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:47,363
So, I took the rest of the day off.
Glass of wine, a little guitar--

133
00:12:47,415 --> 00:12:50,595
-Just relaxing.
- Wow.

134
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,349
The world is being
Fed-Ex'd to hell on a handcart.

135
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:57,947
I believe that anyone who's thinking
about having a child in this world...

136
00:12:58,051 --> 00:13:01,127
is coldly considering
an act of cruelty.

137
00:13:01,231 --> 00:13:05,819
I know, I'm rambling, I'm complaining,
I'm sorry. What's your news, baby?

138
00:13:05,871 --> 00:13:09,416
- I'm pregnant.
- I'm sorry?

139
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,971
I'm pregnant.

140
00:13:15,203 --> 00:13:17,914
- Really?
- Yeah.

141
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:21,668
- Wow.
- Is that all you're gonna say, "wow"?

142
00:13:21,825 --> 00:13:24,327
- You're pregnant?
- Three weeks.

143
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:26,621
How do you know?
I mean, h-how do you know?

144
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:30,375
Blue.

145
00:13:30,427 --> 00:13:33,347
Just turned blue,
so I went to the doctor.

146
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:36,475
- Well, you didn't mean
what you just said, did you?
- When?

147
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:39,134
Just right now, when you were talking
about bringing a child into the world...

148
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:42,992
- and having it be an act of... cruelty.
- I meant it at the time.

149
00:13:43,096 --> 00:13:45,807
Stanley, at the time? You said
it seven and a half seconds ago.

150
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:51,594
Well... gosh, kind of a lot's happened
since then. We're not even married.

151
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,826
I know. It's funny
you should mention that.

152
00:13:54,931 --> 00:13:57,746
- It's funny?
- Do you love me?

153
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,187
- Of course I love you.
- Good.

154
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:09,372
- Will you marry me?
- Whoa, whoa, hey--
Marriage Police, pull over.

155
00:14:09,476 --> 00:14:12,865
Come on, Stanley.
I'm proposing to you right now.

156
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:26,368
The Rock is the most famous and
was the most feared prison ever built.

157
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,288
Is it really true that there's
never been an escape?

158
00:14:29,392 --> 00:14:33,354
Ah, that's true. From 1936
until '63 when the prison closed,

159
00:14:33,511 --> 00:14:35,388
there were 14 attempts.

160
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:39,559
No one is believed to have made it
to shore-- alive, at least.

161
00:14:41,905 --> 00:14:44,616
Uh, hey, hey, fellas. I'm sorry,
but tourists are not allowed back here.

162
00:14:44,824 --> 00:14:46,858
I don't really give a shit.
You give a shit?

163
00:14:47,014 --> 00:14:49,360
- No. Come here, fruity.
- Move!

164
00:14:49,516 --> 00:14:53,427
- Hey, girls? Hi.
You all havin' a good time?
- Yeah.

165
00:14:53,635 --> 00:14:56,555
Will you do something for me?
It's really-- It's really important.

166
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:59,891
I need you to tell your teacher
that you need to get back on the boat
and go home right now.

167
00:15:00,048 --> 00:15:03,489
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Broadway!

168
00:15:03,593 --> 00:15:05,939
This cell block housed...

169
00:15:06,043 --> 00:15:09,537
the most awesome scum
in America.

170
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:13,603
Ladies and gentlemen, I, Ranger Bob,
cordially invite you...

171
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,044
to become inmates of Alcatraz--
temporarily, of course, heh!

172
00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:22,101
On line!

173
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,689
Pretty tight quarters,
aren't they, huh?

174
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,192
Like being a caged animal.

175
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:32,528
Spend a couple of years in there--
What's the matter, fellas?

176
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:35,187
- Something wrong with the tour?
- Tour's over, Bob.

177
00:15:41,496 --> 00:15:44,728
What kind of
fucked-up tour is this?

178
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:01,620
Gen. Hummel, Captains Frye
and Darrow reporting, sir.

179
00:16:01,672 --> 00:16:05,374
Welcome to the Rock, gentlemen.
Land the choppers on the back side
and deploy as planned.

180
00:16:05,426 --> 00:16:07,824
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Aye, aye, sir. Move out!

181
00:16:07,928 --> 00:16:10,014
I'm not allowed
to carry a gun!

182
00:16:10,118 --> 00:16:12,881
Oh, you're not allowed to carry a gun?
I got a goddamned gun!

183
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:16,635
If I'd had known this was gonna happen,
I'd have brought my motherfuckin' gun!

184
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,877
Help!

185
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:23,100
All right, this'll be our new home.
Tom, I want a command center right here.

186
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:33,370
- I want coms up.
- Roger that, sir.

187
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:37,854
Put the satellite over there.
I want to be up at 1600.

188
00:16:37,906 --> 00:16:40,044
Let's move it.

189
00:16:47,864 --> 00:16:50,627
- Systems up.

190
00:16:50,731 --> 00:16:55,267
Possible penetration point in shower
room. We're setting anti-intrusion.

191
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:59,386
I brought a personal touch, sir.
It's an antimotion trembler device.

192
00:16:59,438 --> 00:17:03,870
It's custom-made. Nobody knows
about it, and nobody expects it.

193
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:07,258
- What's it do?
- We head-fake 'em with the laser beam,

194
00:17:07,363 --> 00:17:11,377
and then if they disturb Mr. Backup
here... we own 'em.

195
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:28,634
Ladies and gentlemen, you're
being detained against your will.

196
00:17:28,686 --> 00:17:33,222
For that I apologize. It is not
our intention in anyway to harm you.

197
00:17:33,378 --> 00:17:37,653
You will not be detained
one minute longer than is necessary
for us to complete our mission.

198
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:45,630
Attention on deck!

199
00:17:45,682 --> 00:17:48,915
Stand easy, men.

200
00:17:49,071 --> 00:17:54,232
Make no mistake about it, gentlemen.
We are now in harm's way.

201
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:57,413
For Major Baxter and I, this is the last
campaign in a career dating back...

202
00:17:57,569 --> 00:17:59,602
to Tet '68.

203
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,939
Likewise for Captain Hendrix
and Gunnery Sergeant Crisp,

204
00:18:03,095 --> 00:18:06,797
who cut their teeth
under my command in Desert Storm.

205
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:11,124
Capt. Frye, Capt. Darrow, this is
my first operational situation with you,

206
00:18:11,176 --> 00:18:13,366
and I have to say thus far your conduct
reflects your reputations.

207
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,347
- Thank you, General.
- Thank you, sir.

208
00:18:15,504 --> 00:18:18,788
We have achieved our position
through poise, precision and audacity.

209
00:18:18,945 --> 00:18:21,134
To this we must now add resolve.

210
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:24,680
We'll be branded as traitors;
the gravest capitol crime.

211
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:27,286
Punishable by death.

212
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:32,917
Couple hundred years ago, a few guys
named Washington, Jefferson and Adams...

213
00:18:33,073 --> 00:18:36,202
were branded as traitors
by the British.

214
00:18:36,306 --> 00:18:39,225
And now they're called patriots.

215
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:41,363
In time, so shall we.

216
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,254
God willing, in less than 48 hours, we
will evacuate this island in gunships...

217
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:50,747
under cover of hostages
and V.X. gas warheads.

218
00:18:50,852 --> 00:18:54,345
Your destination:
a nonextradition-treaty country.

219
00:18:54,553 --> 00:18:58,672
You will each be paid a fee
of $1 million for services rendered.

220
00:18:58,828 --> 00:19:03,364
But you can never again
set foot on your native soil.

221
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,909
- Can you live with that?
- Yes, sir!

222
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:09,725
The men of Marine Force Recon
are selected...

223
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:13,948
to carry out illegal operations
throughout the world.

224
00:19:14,104 --> 00:19:16,815
When they don't come home...

225
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:19,787
their families are told fairy tales
about what happened to them...

226
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:23,123
and denied compensation.

227
00:19:23,176 --> 00:19:26,617
Well, I have choked
on these lies my entire career.

228
00:19:26,721 --> 00:19:29,223
Well, here and now
the lies stop!

229
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:38,816
God be with all of you.
Man your positions, men.

230
00:19:42,935 --> 00:19:45,125
This is FBI Director Womack.

231
00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:48,670
Director... be advised,

232
00:19:48,826 --> 00:19:51,642
81... I say again,

233
00:19:51,694 --> 00:19:55,552
81 civilians are under my control
as of this moment.

234
00:19:55,604 --> 00:19:59,879
You are to take measures to assure this
remains a need-to-know classified fact.

235
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:04,154
- Who is this?
- Mr. Director, you have
a very serious problem.

236
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,439
A battery of V.X. gas rockets
is presently deployed to deliver...

237
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:12,235
a highly-lethal strike on the population
of the San Francisco Bay area.

238
00:20:12,391 --> 00:20:14,216
I will call again at 0100 hours
to state my demands.

239
00:20:14,373 --> 00:20:16,875
- I wanna know who I'm talking to.
- This is Brigadier General...

240
00:20:16,979 --> 00:20:21,359
Francis X. Hummel, United States
Marine Corps from Alcatraz... out.

241
00:20:22,506 --> 00:20:25,008
I'll cancel your reservations.

242
00:20:25,112 --> 00:20:28,553
Get the Pentagon
and call the San Francisco office.

243
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:31,629
It seems Alcatraz
was just reopened.

244
00:20:31,734 --> 00:20:35,696
Last night, Gen. Hummel using
brutal but nonlethal force...

245
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,781
under the guise of
a security exercise,

246
00:20:37,886 --> 00:20:41,066
walked off with 15
V.X. poison-gas rockets.

247
00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:43,099
He lost one of his own men
in the process.

248
00:20:43,204 --> 00:20:46,905
That's Gen. Hummel in Vietnam.
I think he was a major at the time.

249
00:20:47,062 --> 00:20:51,232
Three tours in Vietnam,
Panama, Grenada, Desert Storm;

250
00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:56,133
Three Purple Hearts, two Silver Stars
and the Congressional Medal of--

251
00:20:56,237 --> 00:20:59,626
Jesus. This man is a hero.

252
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,920
Well, I think "legend" might be
a better description, Mr. Sinclair.

253
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:05,726
Well, now we can add kidnapping
and extortion to his list of accolades.

254
00:21:05,882 --> 00:21:07,968
Mr. Sinclair,
Gen. Hummel is a man of honor.

255
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:11,305
General, it's him.

256
00:21:13,546 --> 00:21:17,039
- Frank, it's Al Kramer.
- Hi, Al. How ya doin'?

257
00:21:17,092 --> 00:21:19,750
I don't know, Frank.
Why don't you tell me?

258
00:21:19,855 --> 00:21:22,618
There are a lot of very,
very worried people here, Frank.

259
00:21:22,722 --> 00:21:25,068
I'll come straight to the point.

260
00:21:25,173 --> 00:21:28,301
83 Force Reconnaissance Marines
have died under my various commands.

261
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,699
47 in Northern Laos
and Southern China.

262
00:21:30,803 --> 00:21:33,983
Southern China? We never admitted
we sent troops into China.

263
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,330
Who is this?
Identify yourself.

264
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:39,301
White House Chief of Staff
Hayden Sinclair, General.

265
00:21:39,353 --> 00:21:42,846
How old are you,
Chief of Staff Sinclair?

266
00:21:42,951 --> 00:21:45,453
- I'm 33.
- Well, Mr. Sinclair,

267
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:48,634
you've probably got no fucking idea
what I'm talking about.

268
00:21:48,738 --> 00:21:51,136
By your ninth birthday,
I was runnin' black ops into China,

269
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,003
and my men were responsible
for over 200 enemy kills.

270
00:21:54,108 --> 00:21:57,079
Now put some rigging tape
over Mr. Sinclair's mouth.

271
00:21:57,132 --> 00:22:00,573
- He's wasting my time.
- Ah, you want to continue, Frank?

272
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,867
Remember Operation Desert Storm?

273
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:06,672
Those surgical hits made by our
smart bombs covered so well on CNN?

274
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:11,417
It was my men on the ground
that made those hits possible
by lasing the targets.

275
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:14,910
Twenty of them were left to rot outside
Baghdad after the conflict ended.

276
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:19,133
No benefits were paid to their families.
No medals conferred.

277
00:22:21,218 --> 00:22:26,119
These men died for their country,
and they weren't even given
a goddamn military burial.

278
00:22:27,631 --> 00:22:29,977
The situation is unacceptable.

279
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:32,688
You will transfer $100 million
from the Grand Cayman...

280
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:35,660
Red Sea Trading Company account
to an account I designate.

281
00:22:35,816 --> 00:22:38,684
From these funds, reparations
of $1 million will be paid...

282
00:22:38,788 --> 00:22:41,186
to each of
the 83 marines' families.

283
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:44,783
The rest of the funds
I will disperse at my discretion.

284
00:22:44,888 --> 00:22:47,130
Do I make myself clear?

285
00:22:47,182 --> 00:22:50,570
Except for the Red Sea Trading Company.
What is that?

286
00:22:50,623 --> 00:22:53,594
- Identify yourself.
- This is FBI Director Womack, General.

287
00:22:53,699 --> 00:22:57,348
It's a slush fund where the Pentagon
keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.

288
00:22:57,452 --> 00:22:59,903
Jesus, Frank!
This is classified information.

289
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:03,344
You alert the media,
I launch the gas.

290
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,576
You refuse payment,
I launch the gas.

291
00:23:06,628 --> 00:23:10,590
You've got 40 hours--
'til noon, day after tomorrow--
to arrange transfer of the money.

292
00:23:10,747 --> 00:23:14,605
I am aware of your counter measure.
You know and I know it doesn't
stand a chance.

293
00:23:14,657 --> 00:23:16,742
- Hummel from Alcatraz, out.

294
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:20,079
All right.

295
00:23:20,131 --> 00:23:23,676
We have to identify the hostages
and contact each of their families.

296
00:23:23,885 --> 00:23:27,378
Tell 'em somethin'. Make up a story,
and we've got to keep this undercover.

297
00:23:27,535 --> 00:23:31,757
If this comes out, the city of
San Francisco will be in chaos, anarchy.

298
00:23:31,862 --> 00:23:35,303
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What is the potential casualty rate...

299
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:40,099
for a single rocket armed
with V.X. poison gas, Gen. Peterson?

300
00:23:40,203 --> 00:23:43,801
- Sixty or seventy.
- Well, that's not so bad.

301
00:23:43,853 --> 00:23:48,128
Thousand.
Seventy thousand dead.

302
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,787
- Oh.
- One teaspoon of this hits the floor,

303
00:23:50,891 --> 00:23:53,498
it's lethal up to... 100 feet.

304
00:23:53,602 --> 00:23:56,939
One teaspoon of this shit
detonated in the atmosphere...

305
00:23:57,043 --> 00:24:00,328
will kill every living organism
in an eight-block radius.

306
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,882
Get the point?

307
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,854
What did Hummel mean by
your "counter measure," General?

308
00:24:05,906 --> 00:24:09,556
Standard poison is countered by napalm.
It consumes it upon detonation.

309
00:24:09,608 --> 00:24:13,727
Now, the problem with V.X. poison gas
is that it's designed specifically...

310
00:24:13,883 --> 00:24:17,115
to withstand napalm; that's
where thermite plasma comes in.

311
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:20,504
- Gen. Peterson?
- Thermite plasma incendiary systems...

312
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:23,684
can burn hot enough to consume V.X.,
but they're still in the test phase.

313
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:27,595
It's not operational.
Hummel knows this.

314
00:24:27,751 --> 00:24:30,827
We are dealing with
one smart son of a bitch.

315
00:24:30,931 --> 00:24:33,538
What's it gonna take
to equip a flight of F-18s...

316
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,249
with thermite plasma
within the next 36 hours?

317
00:24:36,353 --> 00:24:39,794
- An act of God.
- Excuse me?

318
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:42,245
All right. We can try.

319
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:46,311
But I strongly urge you to consider the
use of this as a secondary initiative.

320
00:24:46,363 --> 00:24:48,814
Then we have to go to our
primary initiative. Uh, Admiral?

321
00:24:48,866 --> 00:24:52,359
Sir, I'd like to bring in our SEAL
ground commander, Cmdr. Anderson.

322
00:24:52,515 --> 00:24:57,155
Mr. Womack, who is your best
chemical/biological man?

323
00:24:57,468 --> 00:24:59,658
That's interesting.

324
00:24:59,814 --> 00:25:02,734
- Oh, yeah.
- That's very compelling.

325
00:25:05,445 --> 00:25:08,000
Ahh, you like my pigtails?

326
00:25:08,104 --> 00:25:11,128
Oh, yeah.
Pigtails are naughty.

327
00:25:11,232 --> 00:25:14,099
- Naughty, naughty--

328
00:25:14,256 --> 00:25:16,967
You're just an amaretto cream
with peach sorbet persuasion.

329
00:25:17,123 --> 00:25:19,939
- This isn't happening.

330
00:25:20,043 --> 00:25:22,389
- No, Stan. Don't answer it.
- This isn't happening!

331
00:25:22,441 --> 00:25:24,891
- No, just don't answer it. It's okay.
- I have to.

332
00:25:24,996 --> 00:25:27,185
- It's the office, baby.
They know I'm home.
- Oh-h-h-h!

333
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:31,096
- How could they possibly know
that you're home?
- It's the FBI.

334
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:37,248
- Stanley! Tsk!
- Goodspeed.

335
00:25:37,352 --> 00:25:40,115
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'll be--
I'll be down--

336
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:43,243
- Yeah, downstairs in ten minutes.
- No, you won't.

337
00:25:45,381 --> 00:25:49,864
- I have to go to San Francisco.
- No, you don't.

338
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:53,253
Stanley. No, you do not have
to go to San Francisco.

339
00:25:53,357 --> 00:25:56,068
Right now, you need to stay here
and talk to me about things.

340
00:25:56,173 --> 00:25:59,249
- I've got to go, baby.
- I am a Catholic.

341
00:25:59,353 --> 00:26:01,699
Do you realize that?
I am pregnant, and I am unmarried...

342
00:26:01,803 --> 00:26:04,202
and this causes
a serious problem for me.

343
00:26:04,306 --> 00:26:06,183
I cannot believe you.

344
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,392
N-N-No.

345
00:26:17,496 --> 00:26:21,041
- I love you.

346
00:26:21,093 --> 00:26:25,577
I will marry you.
I just didn't plan on this, that's all.

347
00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:28,601
- Come to San Francisco.

348
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:31,677
- Really?
- Yeah. I'm sure it's just
a training exercise.

349
00:26:31,781 --> 00:26:34,127
Check into the hotel,
order up some champagne--

350
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:36,369
- And we'll finish what we started?
- Exactly.

351
00:26:36,421 --> 00:26:38,611
- Baby, you gonna marry me?
- You know it.

352
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:42,313
You're gonna marry me!
Oh, honey, come on.

353
00:26:42,365 --> 00:26:44,763
-Just a really quick one.
- Oh! Oh! I gotta go!

354
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:44,972
A nighttime airdrop incursion
is out, due to the full moon.

355
00:26:44,972 --> 00:26:48,100
A nighttime airdrop incursion
is out, due to the full moon.

356
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,237
Likewise,
a frontal seaside attack.

357
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:53,261
If we're compromised and shots
are fired, Hummel might launch.

358
00:26:53,365 --> 00:26:56,076
Our only alternative is an attack
from within the prison.

359
00:26:56,129 --> 00:26:59,622
We penetrate the island through tunnels
under the prison buildings undetected...

360
00:26:59,726 --> 00:27:02,906
and emerge in its center; that way,
we can jump the marines from behind.

361
00:27:03,063 --> 00:27:06,503
And if we're lucky, take their rocket
positions without a shot fired.

362
00:27:06,608 --> 00:27:09,319
I don't understand. You-You've
studied the architectural plans?

363
00:27:09,371 --> 00:27:13,125
They're useless. Alcatraz has been
ripped up and rebuilt for years.

364
00:27:13,229 --> 00:27:16,253
- Under there is a maze of shit.
- There's no question, gentlemen.

365
00:27:16,357 --> 00:27:18,807
We need firsthand intelligence
of the tunnel systems.

366
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,092
- So what about the former warden?
- Died in 1979.

367
00:27:22,248 --> 00:27:24,594
All the guards
we contacted were useless.

368
00:27:24,699 --> 00:27:28,870
Umm... there is someone who,
I think, can help us.

369
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,813
This is for the sake
of national security.

370
00:27:34,865 --> 00:27:39,192
No, it's the sake of national security
that got us here in the first place
33 years ago.

371
00:27:39,297 --> 00:27:42,685
I knew someday this would come back
to bite us. Forget it.

372
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,866
- He does not exist.
- He does exist!

373
00:27:46,074 --> 00:27:49,567
We chose to forget him for 30 years.
We locked him up and threw away the key.

374
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:51,757
Oh, and a lot of
goddamn good it did us.

375
00:27:51,861 --> 00:27:55,094
He broke out of two maximum security
prisons, and if he hits the streets--

376
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,544
He's not gonna "hit the streets," Jim!

377
00:27:57,596 --> 00:28:00,620
Thirty years ago, he was
a highly-trained S.A.S. operative.

378
00:28:00,724 --> 00:28:05,469
He is my age now, for Christ's sake.
I have to get up three times a night
to take a piss.

379
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:08,075
We can't risk letting him out.

380
00:28:08,128 --> 00:28:11,516
He's a professional
escape artist.

381
00:28:43,163 --> 00:28:45,561
Oh, here he is now.

382
00:28:45,613 --> 00:28:48,376
- Ah. Neat, uh--
- Yeah.

383
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,879
- Neat, neat plane.
- Dr. Goodspeed. James Womack.

384
00:28:50,983 --> 00:28:53,642
- Pleasure meeting you, sir. Thank you.
- Welcome.

385
00:28:53,694 --> 00:28:55,988
You come very highly recommended.
B.A., Columbia;

386
00:28:56,092 --> 00:28:58,125
M.A., PhD, Johns Hopkins.

387
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,367
Biochemistry/toxicology?

388
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,922
Well, I'm one of those fortunate people
who like my job, sir.

389
00:29:03,078 --> 00:29:05,946
Got my first chemistry set when
I was seven. Blew my eyebrows off.

390
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:08,918
We never saw the cat again.
Been into it ever since.

391
00:29:09,074 --> 00:29:11,368
- What do you know about V.X. gas?
- Liquid.

392
00:29:11,472 --> 00:29:14,235
Failed pesticide discovered
by mistake in 1952.

393
00:29:14,392 --> 00:29:17,155
Actually, it's like champagne that way.
The Franciscan monks thought...

394
00:29:17,311 --> 00:29:20,700
they were making white wine, somehow the
bottle carbonated, voila, champagne--

395
00:29:20,804 --> 00:29:24,298
- The gas, Dr. Goodspeed.
- It's very, very horrible, sir.

396
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,113
It's one of those things
we wish we could disinvent.

397
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:30,658
This isn't
a training exercise, is it?

398
00:29:30,867 --> 00:29:35,246
No, Dr. Goodspeed,
it's not a training exercise.

399
00:30:12,888 --> 00:30:14,765
- Ernest.
- Good morning, Director.

400
00:30:14,869 --> 00:30:17,319
This is Ernest Paxton, agent in charge
of the West Coast operation.

401
00:30:17,371 --> 00:30:19,874
- Dr. Goodspeed.
- Pleasure to meet you.

402
00:30:19,926 --> 00:30:22,429
- How do you do, sir?
- It's been a fairly
interesting day so far.

403
00:30:22,637 --> 00:30:24,827
The prison's here. Shall we?

404
00:30:24,879 --> 00:30:28,320
Now, my boys, they haven't been
able to find a file on this guy.

405
00:30:28,372 --> 00:30:31,031
- Who is he, anyway, sir?
- His name is John Mason,

406
00:30:31,135 --> 00:30:34,993
a British national
incarcerated on Alcatraz in 1962;

407
00:30:35,097 --> 00:30:37,548
escaped in '63.

408
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,188
- I was under the impression that
no one escaped Alcatraz, sir.
- Paxton, don't argue!

409
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:46,411
This man has no identity, not in
the United States or Great Britain.

410
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:49,800
He does not exist. Understand?
I want one thing:

411
00:30:49,852 --> 00:30:53,866
how he escaped the rock-- specifically,
how he took through the island's bowels.

412
00:30:53,971 --> 00:30:55,952
Papers are in order, sir.

413
00:30:56,108 --> 00:30:59,028
We're prepared to offer him
a full pardon.

414
00:30:59,132 --> 00:31:02,625
And Paxton, no strong-arming Mason.
I know him too well.

415
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:05,492
Well, if you know him,
why don't you question him?

416
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:09,507
No. He'll remember me. I don't want
his anger clouding the issue.

417
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:11,540
All right,
I'll take care of him.

418
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:23,688
Mr. Mason, I'm special agent
in charge Ernest Baxter.

419
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:28,536
In charge of what? Fucking me over
for another three decades?

420
00:31:28,641 --> 00:31:31,612
I don't know anything about your
previous matters. I'm here because...

421
00:31:31,664 --> 00:31:35,314
a special situation exists that we feel
you might be able to help us with.

422
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:38,911
Now, what might that be? I've been
in jail longer than Nelson Mandela,

423
00:31:39,068 --> 00:31:41,362
so maybe you want me
to run for president.

424
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,594
- Not exactly.
- Ah, pity.

425
00:31:44,698 --> 00:31:47,931
- I feel rather like Alcamenes.
- Who?

426
00:31:48,035 --> 00:31:51,424
Alcamenes. He was imprisoned
by his king in ancient Greece.

427
00:31:51,528 --> 00:31:54,552
Like Sir Walter Raleigh.
Same fate.

428
00:31:54,604 --> 00:31:57,576
-James the First.
- Even someone as bright as you...

429
00:31:57,628 --> 00:32:01,851
must be aware that, uh, there's
a certain pattern emerging here.

430
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:05,813
- Alexander Solzhenitsyn?
- Yeah, I heard of him.

431
00:32:05,865 --> 00:32:08,368
Didn't he play hockey
for the fuckin' Redwings?

432
00:32:08,472 --> 00:32:10,975
- That's the chap.
- Get this straight, Pops.

433
00:32:11,131 --> 00:32:13,373
I don't like you any more
than you like me.

434
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:15,927
But I'm here to make you
a legitimate offer.

435
00:32:16,032 --> 00:32:18,169
You wanna hear
what I have to say or not?

436
00:32:18,378 --> 00:32:22,132
By all means,
dear Paxton, by all means.

437
00:32:22,236 --> 00:32:25,364
We got a problem in a place
that I think you know.

438
00:32:25,468 --> 00:32:28,127
There's a hostage situation
on Alcatraz.

439
00:32:28,231 --> 00:32:31,933
- Hostage?
- Eighty-one tourists.

440
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:35,113
The Rock has become
a tourist attraction?

441
00:32:35,218 --> 00:32:38,971
Why don't we cut the shit, huh?
You know the Rock. You broke out.

442
00:32:39,128 --> 00:32:42,517
- Yes, successfully.
- Yeah.

443
00:32:42,621 --> 00:32:44,967
So why don't you do yourself a favor
while you're helpin' us.

444
00:32:45,123 --> 00:32:47,991
I mean, it'd be nice to get out of jail
while you're still vertical.

445
00:32:48,095 --> 00:32:51,223
Hmm? While you got a little lead
left in your pencil?

446
00:32:52,944 --> 00:32:55,759
While I'm considering
your offer,

447
00:32:55,863 --> 00:33:00,034
I want a suite
at the Fairmont Hotel.

448
00:33:00,138 --> 00:33:03,006
You know, I'm here
to cut you a deal.

449
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:07,437
I am not here to bend over
and take it up the ass from you.

450
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:10,878
Here. Here's a quarter.

451
00:33:15,153 --> 00:33:17,917
Do yourself a favor.
Call your lawyer.

452
00:33:18,073 --> 00:33:19,950
You're goin' back to jail.

453
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:26,050
- You're sending him back to jail?
- I'm not sending him anywhere.

454
00:33:26,102 --> 00:33:29,438
I'm just givin' him
somethin' to think about.

455
00:33:29,543 --> 00:33:31,680
I don't think we have time for him
to just sit around and think about it.

456
00:33:31,785 --> 00:33:35,799
- Oh, really?
- No, Goodspeed's right.
You, go talk to him.

457
00:33:35,851 --> 00:33:38,614
- Me? Sir, I'm not qualified for that.
- Yes.

458
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:41,951
- You're an FBI agent.
- What is your specialty again?

459
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:44,818
- Chemical weapons.
- Don't mention that!

460
00:33:48,624 --> 00:33:51,127
- You want me to lie?
- Yeah, lie.

461
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:55,610
We got less than 24 hours.
Give it a shot.

462
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,364
Okay.

463
00:34:04,474 --> 00:34:05,725
Hiya!

464
00:34:05,881 --> 00:34:08,592
I'm an agent with the, uh,

465
00:34:08,696 --> 00:34:11,355
eh, Federal-- FBI.

466
00:34:11,408 --> 00:34:15,891
Uh-- Eh, well, my--
I'm Stanley Goodspeed.

467
00:34:15,995 --> 00:34:19,384
- But of course you are.
- At least he got his name right.

468
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:24,076
- Of course I am.
- And you have an emergency.

469
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:27,465
- That's right.

470
00:34:27,622 --> 00:34:31,949
- And you need my help.
- Exactly right.

471
00:34:32,053 --> 00:34:33,930
- Coffee.

472
00:34:34,034 --> 00:34:36,433
No, no, I'm fine,
thank you.

473
00:34:36,537 --> 00:34:38,727
Offer me coffee.

474
00:34:38,883 --> 00:34:42,167
Oh, yes. Well, that was, in fact,
going to be my next--

475
00:34:42,324 --> 00:34:45,139
Could we get a cup of coffee
in here, please?

476
00:34:45,191 --> 00:34:48,111
And offer...
to take these off.

477
00:34:48,163 --> 00:34:50,405
Mr. Mason, really.

478
00:34:50,561 --> 00:34:53,742
- All kidding aside--
- As a gesture of your good faith.

479
00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:00,780
- Prisoner requests
to have his handcuffs taken off.
- No, no, no!

480
00:35:00,884 --> 00:35:05,316
Look, why don't you go ahead and have
his handcuffs taken off, please?

481
00:35:05,368 --> 00:35:07,922
Well, I guess that's
one way to go.

482
00:35:10,633 --> 00:35:14,283
This is a pardon and release contract
from the Attorney General's office.

483
00:35:14,387 --> 00:35:18,871
Now, it makes you a free man...
provided you cooperate.

484
00:35:18,975 --> 00:35:23,354
So, if you'll just, ah, sign,
uh, eh, where it says--

485
00:35:23,407 --> 00:35:26,691
- "Signature"?
- That's-- Yes. "Signature."

486
00:35:26,795 --> 00:35:32,217
Well... timeo Danaos
et dona ferentes.

487
00:35:32,374 --> 00:35:35,606
"I fear the Greeks
even when they bring gifts."

488
00:35:35,763 --> 00:35:38,161
Oh, an educated man.

489
00:35:38,317 --> 00:35:42,123
That rules out the possibility
of you being a field agent.

490
00:35:43,531 --> 00:35:46,555
In point of fact,
I am a field agent, Mr. Mason.

491
00:35:46,607 --> 00:35:48,744
- Really.
- Yes.

492
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:52,498
- In which field?
- Antiterrorism.

493
00:35:52,602 --> 00:35:56,617
Then you're trained in weaponry,
explosives and mortal combat.

494
00:35:56,825 --> 00:35:58,702
Well-trained.

495
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,039
- Then it's the Fairmont Hotel.

496
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:06,418
Okay.

497
00:36:06,575 --> 00:36:10,798
I want a suite...
a shower, a shave...

498
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,248
and the feel of a suit.

499
00:36:13,352 --> 00:36:16,533
May I also suggest a...
a haircut.

500
00:36:16,637 --> 00:36:20,182
- Am I out of style?
- Unless you're a 20-year-old
guitarist from Seattle.

501
00:36:20,286 --> 00:36:23,258
- It's a grunge thing.
- Grunge?

502
00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:26,386
Yeah. Well, uh, uh--
Okay. Thank you very much.

503
00:36:26,438 --> 00:36:29,567
All right. Call the Fairmont.
Close the floor if necessary,

504
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:32,590
but I want him sealed off
and he gets two hours max.

505
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:52,141
- Great job, Goodspeed.
- Why don't you throw in a trip
to Tahiti while you're at it?

506
00:36:52,245 --> 00:36:54,122
I'll deliver this
to the Attorney General.

507
00:36:54,227 --> 00:36:57,355
Ah, no, you'll give it to me, Reynolds.
And take Attorney Reynolds outside.

508
00:36:57,407 --> 00:37:00,066
There's a car waiting for you.
Thank you.

509
00:37:03,037 --> 00:37:06,478
That's a signed Federal document, sir.
Isn't that illegal?

510
00:37:06,635 --> 00:37:09,137
You're not acquainted
with the full facts, Goodspeed.

511
00:37:09,189 --> 00:37:13,621
With all due respect, sir, I'd like
clarification. I gave that man my word.

512
00:37:13,725 --> 00:37:17,635
Damn it! You're on a need-to-know
basis, and you don't need to know!

513
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:22,067
It's uh, eh, kind of curious,
but, uh--

514
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:25,351
Sir Walter Raleigh, Alcamenes,
Solzhenitsyn, they, uh--

515
00:37:25,404 --> 00:37:27,437
Well, they were all
wrongfully imprisoned.

516
00:37:35,622 --> 00:37:37,030
Womack!

517
00:37:37,134 --> 00:37:41,357
Now, why am I not surprised?
You piece of shit!

518
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:43,912
- Hey, peace! Peace!

519
00:37:49,855 --> 00:37:53,244
Hey, we're not home. Leave a message.

520
00:37:53,348 --> 00:37:56,164
- Hi, darling, it's, uh, it's me.

521
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,846
Uh, listen, don't come to San Francisco.
I repeat, do not come to San Francisco.

522
00:38:02,003 --> 00:38:04,922
- Stanley, like hell I'm not comin'!
- Carla! Carla!

523
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:09,562
- Wait! Carla--

524
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:15,819
Who's Carla? And why don't you
want her to come to San Francisco?

525
00:38:19,572 --> 00:38:23,795
You're on a need-to-know basis,
and you don't need to know.

526
00:38:23,952 --> 00:38:25,985
- Watch it, he'll bite you!

527
00:38:34,744 --> 00:38:38,654
Good. Mobile command
is fully operational.

528
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:41,313
We'll be there
in approximately two hours.

529
00:38:41,365 --> 00:38:43,294
- I'm not armed, sir.
- Right.

530
00:38:43,346 --> 00:38:46,057
- I am unarmed, sir.
- Well, where's your issue?

531
00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:50,384
I left it in my--
uh, my sock drawer.

532
00:38:50,437 --> 00:38:53,356
A gun?

533
00:38:53,408 --> 00:38:56,484
For what?
You're a chemical freak.

534
00:38:56,641 --> 00:39:01,698
No, I'm a chemical super-freak,
actually, but I still need a gun.

535
00:39:01,802 --> 00:39:03,887
Give 'im a goddamn gun.

536
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:10,039
Have you fired one of those things
since the academy?

537
00:39:10,092 --> 00:39:14,262
- # If you're going to San Francisco #

538
00:39:14,367 --> 00:39:18,955
# Don't forget to wear flowers
in your hair #

539
00:39:19,111 --> 00:39:23,595
# If you're going to San Francisco #

540
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:29,382
# You're sure to meet
some gentle people there #

541
00:39:29,538 --> 00:39:33,761
-# Gentle people there #
- # And you come for-- #

542
00:39:33,865 --> 00:39:36,785
- # If you're going to San Francisco #

543
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:39,444
- Fairmont Hotel.
- Heh, uh, room service?

544
00:39:39,548 --> 00:39:41,529
Uh, this--
this is the penthouse.

545
00:39:41,634 --> 00:39:43,719
Do you have any snacks
and drinks, huh?

546
00:39:43,928 --> 00:39:46,013
Hello-o-o.

547
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,672
- You the barber?
- No. Stylist.

548
00:39:48,828 --> 00:39:52,373
- Barber.
-Just clippers, no scissors.

549
00:39:52,478 --> 00:39:54,980
No scissors? You've got to be
kidding me, no scissors.

550
00:39:55,137 --> 00:39:57,378
I mean, did they tell Picasso
"no brush"?

551
00:39:57,483 --> 00:39:59,360
With scissors,
this man could kill you.

552
00:39:59,412 --> 00:40:03,374
I can't cut anyone's balls off
with a trimmer, now can I?

553
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:09,005
Why don't we do this outside?
Get some sun.

554
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:13,749
Oh! Who did this to you? This is
just not right. In fact, it's nasty.

555
00:40:13,853 --> 00:40:17,659
- Well, it's a... grunge thing.
- Well, it's some kind of thing.

556
00:40:17,816 --> 00:40:20,892
Do you think we have time for a sea kelp
protein pack and maybe some color?

557
00:40:20,996 --> 00:40:24,854
- No.
- Okay.

558
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,200
- Not very nice, is he?

559
00:40:27,304 --> 00:40:30,432
- No, he's not.

560
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:45,604
# 'Cause I'm leavin' #

561
00:40:45,656 --> 00:40:48,784
- # On a jet plane #
- Hey, can't let it go to waste.

562
00:40:48,888 --> 00:40:52,069
- # Don't know when I'll be back again #
- Don't you ever stop eatin'?

563
00:40:52,173 --> 00:40:54,258
- Not when it's free.

564
00:40:54,363 --> 00:40:57,699
- We're supposed to be on duty.
- Hey, don't worry. He's an old man.

565
00:40:57,803 --> 00:41:00,827
The boss is watchin' 'im.
Come on, Try some of this lobster.

566
00:41:00,879 --> 00:41:04,633
-Mm-hmm.
-My secretary here will settle the bill.

567
00:41:04,685 --> 00:41:08,387
So, what do you have in store for me,
Womack, when this is over?

568
00:41:08,439 --> 00:41:11,202
You'll get your life back, Mason.

569
00:41:11,307 --> 00:41:14,383
But you could've given me
my life back years ago.

570
00:41:17,354 --> 00:41:20,378
Why should I trust you now?

571
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,568
You've got my word.

572
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,601
Will you shake on it?

573
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,635
- Freeze, mister!

574
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:39,616
Oh, man!

575
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,640
Help!

576
00:41:42,744 --> 00:41:45,977
Drop the gun...
or I drop your boss.

577
00:41:46,133 --> 00:41:49,939
- You will not!
- Aaah! Get!

578
00:41:50,043 --> 00:41:54,631
- He's gettin' very heavy.
- Then pull him up!

579
00:41:54,683 --> 00:41:56,717
Aah! Uuh!

580
00:41:56,873 --> 00:41:59,480
- Please don't.

581
00:41:59,636 --> 00:42:01,357
- Ohh!

582
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:04,172
Help! Shit!

583
00:42:04,328 --> 00:42:07,039
-# Hold me like you'll never--#
- Come on, have a scallop. Catch.

584
00:42:07,092 --> 00:42:10,324
Ohh!

585
00:42:11,627 --> 00:42:13,869
Ooh-ooh!

586
00:42:13,921 --> 00:42:17,884
- You hoist him in!
- Yaah! Oh!

587
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:19,760
Help! Help! Help!

588
00:42:19,865 --> 00:42:22,680
- Where's Mason?
- Hang on!

589
00:42:22,784 --> 00:42:25,078
- Mason's gone!
- Gone?

590
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:28,467
- Clear!

591
00:42:28,623 --> 00:42:32,064
Living room's clear!

592
00:42:32,169 --> 00:42:35,453
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

593
00:42:35,557 --> 00:42:38,373
All units, this is Caretender. We have
a signal six. He's in the hotel!

594
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:49,113
Okay, I don't wanna know nothin'.
I never saw you throw that gentleman
off the balcony.

595
00:42:49,165 --> 00:42:53,388
All I care about is,
are you happy with your haircut?

596
00:42:53,492 --> 00:42:56,620
- Aah! Easy! Aah!

597
00:42:56,672 --> 00:43:01,365
Watch it, you fuckhead!
You're gonna pull my arm out!

598
00:43:01,417 --> 00:43:03,919
Watch out! Aah!

599
00:43:17,735 --> 00:43:19,873
- Uuh!
- Watch it!

600
00:43:24,617 --> 00:43:27,693
- Hey, watch it!
- He's right over there!

601
00:43:32,907 --> 00:43:35,357
Uuh! Ah!

602
00:43:35,409 --> 00:43:37,234
Uuh!

603
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:46,097
Hey! Uuh! Ooh!

604
00:43:46,305 --> 00:43:48,860
This is my Humvee. I don't want
any dings, dents or scratches.

605
00:43:49,016 --> 00:43:53,448
Or I'll have your ass. Hey!
Hey! Stop! Hey!

606
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,799
- I was inside with Jack Powell!

607
00:44:00,903 --> 00:44:03,979
- Hey, call the guard!
- Go!

608
00:44:05,126 --> 00:44:07,785
FBI.

609
00:44:18,473 --> 00:44:20,975
Whoo!

610
00:44:26,502 --> 00:44:29,578
- Whoa! Whoa!

611
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:33,175
Suspect is in a black Humvee
heading west on California.

612
00:44:33,279 --> 00:44:35,365
Speed approximately
70 miles per hour.

613
00:44:42,403 --> 00:44:44,801
Get out of the way!

614
00:44:48,138 --> 00:44:50,640
I want a net put on this
son of a bitch, you hear me?

615
00:45:23,694 --> 00:45:26,666
This guy's hittin' every fuckin' thing
in sight tryin' to block us!

616
00:46:00,554 --> 00:46:02,952
Aah!

617
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,697
I hope you're insured!

618
00:46:16,091 --> 00:46:19,219
- Oh, well, why not?

619
00:46:34,182 --> 00:46:36,684
You're goin' down!

620
00:46:57,173 --> 00:46:59,728
- Hello?

621
00:46:59,884 --> 00:47:02,074
Sie haben meine Hummer gestolen!

622
00:47:02,126 --> 00:47:04,629
I'm only borrowing your Humvee!

623
00:47:08,278 --> 00:47:10,311
Information?

624
00:47:10,364 --> 00:47:12,293
San Francisco.

625
00:47:12,345 --> 00:47:15,473
Uh, Jade Angelou.
That's A-N-G--

626
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:20,061
Welcome aboard, y'all.
How y'all doin' today?

627
00:47:23,137 --> 00:47:24,388
Hang on!

628
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,488
- Holy shit!

629
00:47:40,967 --> 00:47:43,157
Whoa-oa!

630
00:47:44,825 --> 00:47:47,797
- Oh, no!

631
00:47:51,759 --> 00:47:54,001
We're gonna crash!
Save yourselves!

632
00:47:59,632 --> 00:48:01,613
Oh, my baby!

633
00:48:05,471 --> 00:48:08,390
Oh, no!

634
00:48:20,851 --> 00:48:23,822
Oh, no.

635
00:48:26,846 --> 00:48:29,609
Oh! Oh, God.

636
00:48:30,548 --> 00:48:33,050
Oh, God!

637
00:48:51,246 --> 00:48:54,791
Hey, man.
You just fucked up your Ferrari.

638
00:48:54,947 --> 00:48:58,128
- Oh, no!
Baby's goin' down in flames!
- It's not mine.

639
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,578
- Neither is this.

640
00:49:04,592 --> 00:49:08,033
Damn! This sucks!
Where's that son of a bitch at?

641
00:49:08,138 --> 00:49:11,943
I'm gonna hunt him down!
That motherfucker ain't safe nowhere!

642
00:49:12,048 --> 00:49:14,550
- Chem Weapons, Isherwood.

643
00:49:14,654 --> 00:49:18,095
Marvin, look up
Wolfburg Federal Penitentiary.

644
00:49:18,252 --> 00:49:20,233
The inmate is Mason, John.

645
00:49:20,389 --> 00:49:23,205
Hey, Stan, listen. I'm gettin'
out of this government shithole.

646
00:49:23,309 --> 00:49:26,281
I'm goin' over to Orkin
to design Roach Motels. Cool, huh?

647
00:49:26,385 --> 00:49:28,314
Look, I just stole
a kid's motorcycle.

648
00:49:28,366 --> 00:49:30,504
I'm not really feeling too good.
Wolfburg, got it?

649
00:49:30,608 --> 00:49:35,039
Yeah, I got it. All right,
Magrane, Masconi, Masters. No Mason.

650
00:49:35,092 --> 00:49:39,940
Go to February '76. Who was transferred
to Wolfburg from San Quentin?

651
00:49:40,201 --> 00:49:42,130
- This is weird.

652
00:49:42,182 --> 00:49:46,040
They got medical records,
they got place of birth-- Glasgow--

653
00:49:46,196 --> 00:49:48,178
Uh, but they don't have a name.

654
00:49:48,282 --> 00:49:50,367
Uh, wait a minute, wait a minute!

655
00:49:50,472 --> 00:49:55,112
They have next of kin, a Jade Angelou
of 32 Stenson Drive, San Francisco.

656
00:50:15,236 --> 00:50:17,165
Jade?

657
00:50:17,321 --> 00:50:21,388
No, I'm Stacy, Jade's friend.

658
00:50:25,507 --> 00:50:27,905
Were you afraid to come alone?

659
00:50:28,061 --> 00:50:30,303
Yeah.

660
00:50:30,355 --> 00:50:32,597
It's okay.

661
00:50:32,753 --> 00:50:35,308
I'll be over here
if you need me.

662
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,844
- Last photograph I had of you...
you were about ten.
- Yeah?

663
00:50:41,564 --> 00:50:46,517
Well, I found a picture of you
among my mom's things... when she died.

664
00:50:46,621 --> 00:50:49,489
Oh, yeah? Well, uh--

665
00:50:51,262 --> 00:50:55,849
- Why don't we take a walk?
- I got him. Palace of Fine Arts.

666
00:50:56,006 --> 00:50:59,916
Your mother, uh--
Ya know, well, sh-she was very special.

667
00:51:00,072 --> 00:51:02,471
Yeah, she was.

668
00:51:02,627 --> 00:51:06,329
But I don't think we should romanticize
what happened between you and her.

669
00:51:06,381 --> 00:51:09,092
Meeting in a bar
after a Led Zeppelin concert.

670
00:51:09,196 --> 00:51:12,481
Head out,
and I was the result.

671
00:51:12,637 --> 00:51:16,078
Well, I'd like to think
it would've led somewhere, if only--

672
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:18,059
If only what?
Six federal marshals...

673
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:21,239
hadn't kicked down our door
and dragged you back to prison?

674
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:23,429
I'm sorry.

675
00:51:23,533 --> 00:51:26,766
It's all right.

676
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:29,842
- So they let you out?
- Yeah.

677
00:51:30,937 --> 00:51:33,856
That's good.

678
00:51:33,908 --> 00:51:36,880
What did you do?

679
00:51:42,354 --> 00:51:46,160
Jade, I don't have
a great deal of time here.

680
00:51:48,141 --> 00:51:52,886
But I'll be coming back,
and, uh, maybe we can--

681
00:51:52,938 --> 00:51:54,606
What? We can what?

682
00:51:56,118 --> 00:52:01,905
You know... you're almost
the only evidence that I exist.

683
00:52:02,114 --> 00:52:04,564
But I don't know you.

684
00:52:04,668 --> 00:52:07,327
That's what I want to change, eh?

685
00:52:11,446 --> 00:52:16,034
I've rehearsed this speech a thousand
times on the chance that we would meet.

686
00:52:16,138 --> 00:52:18,745
Here we are... and I'm lost.

687
00:52:18,849 --> 00:52:22,290
Well, I don't know how I'm
supposed to be feeling either.

688
00:52:22,342 --> 00:52:25,940
Jade, I'm not an evil man.

689
00:52:26,044 --> 00:52:29,641
If you can believe that,
then it's a start.

690
00:52:33,499 --> 00:52:35,220
Okay.

691
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,514
Is this about you?

692
00:53:00,453 --> 00:53:04,572
You broke out of prison again,
didn't you?

693
00:53:04,624 --> 00:53:07,179
- Why did you come to me?
- FBI, ma'am.

694
00:53:07,283 --> 00:53:11,819
Your father's working with us.
He's helping us resolve
a dangerous situation.

695
00:53:11,871 --> 00:53:14,061
- He is?
- Yes, ma'am.

696
00:53:14,113 --> 00:53:17,502
Well, gee whiz, John,
I guess we oughta get goin', huh?

697
00:53:17,606 --> 00:53:20,890
Whatever you say, Stanley.

698
00:53:26,156 --> 00:53:28,502
Thank you for that.
You could've handled it differently.

699
00:53:28,606 --> 00:53:31,943
What do you say we cut
the chitchat, a-hole?

700
00:53:32,047 --> 00:53:36,062
You almost got me killed twice,
and my jaw hurts like hell.

701
00:53:36,114 --> 00:53:38,929
- Good.
- Cocksucker!

702
00:53:39,138 --> 00:53:42,474
If I had my way, you would be shipped
back to Wolfburg in leg irons...

703
00:53:42,631 --> 00:53:45,029
and caged like an animal for the rest
of your natural fuckin' life!

704
00:53:45,133 --> 00:53:47,062
You wrecked half the city!

705
00:53:50,816 --> 00:53:54,361
- Give me a hand with the system.
- Now, tell me about the tunnels.

706
00:53:54,413 --> 00:53:58,167
If you know the system, it will take you
wherever you need to go.

707
00:53:58,324 --> 00:54:03,850
There's an intake pipe here, below
low tide. Is that our best access?

708
00:54:03,954 --> 00:54:07,291
- Yes, that's exactly where I came out.
- Then beneath the cistern...

709
00:54:07,343 --> 00:54:09,846
there's a connection
to the abandoned septic system.

710
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:14,798
- How many feet is that?
- Ehh... 57 paces.

711
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:17,040
Where do we go from there?

712
00:54:19,803 --> 00:54:22,567
Where do you go from there?

713
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:25,121
That's a good question.

714
00:54:26,998 --> 00:54:30,491
- I have no idea.
- What?

715
00:54:30,595 --> 00:54:33,880
I mean... I'll know
when we're all inside.

716
00:54:33,984 --> 00:54:37,529
No. You're not goddamn goin'.
Show us on the blueprints.

717
00:54:37,634 --> 00:54:41,075
I can't!
My blueprint was in my head.

718
00:54:41,127 --> 00:54:44,620
I was underground
for three days in the dark,

719
00:54:44,672 --> 00:54:47,852
just waiting
for the tides to be right.

720
00:54:48,009 --> 00:54:50,094
But don't worry.
It'll all come back to me.

721
00:54:50,303 --> 00:54:53,379
You're not going anywhere, Mason.

722
00:54:53,483 --> 00:54:54,995
Wait a second.

723
00:54:55,099 --> 00:54:59,478
This piece of work might be the only
chance those people over there have.

724
00:54:59,635 --> 00:55:02,346
If he's not going, then why the hell
did we get him out of jail?

725
00:55:02,502 --> 00:55:05,683
- He's smart.
- I got him out to get you
people in, not go with you.

726
00:55:05,787 --> 00:55:09,749
If it's the only way of getting
the intelligence I need, then he goes.

727
00:55:09,853 --> 00:55:11,782
He'll fuck with you.

728
00:55:11,887 --> 00:55:15,640
You compromise my men's lives,
and I'll bury you out there.

729
00:55:17,569 --> 00:55:22,470
Now, Womack... you're between
the Rock and a hard case.

730
00:55:23,826 --> 00:55:26,641
Hmm.
How's your bowling arm?

731
00:55:29,613 --> 00:55:31,802
Dr. Goodspeed, the goal
is to take out the launchers...

732
00:55:31,855 --> 00:55:34,044
then neutralize
the V.X. chemical rounds.

733
00:55:34,096 --> 00:55:36,755
Well, we know the poison's
being kept in the prison morgue...

734
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:40,301
from the satellite thermal imagining,
which is right here-- these dots.

735
00:55:40,405 --> 00:55:42,490
Have you ever actually seen
one of these devices?

736
00:55:42,595 --> 00:55:44,628
No, sir,
but I've studied them.

737
00:55:44,732 --> 00:55:48,225
I should really begin briefing your guys
on defusing and detoxification.

738
00:55:48,382 --> 00:55:51,249
Got a really neat layout here
of the chem round as well as the rocket.

739
00:55:51,353 --> 00:55:53,856
- So let's get rolling.
- That won't be necessary.

740
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:58,444
Oh, it's very necessary, sir.

741
00:55:58,548 --> 00:56:01,363
The power of this chemical
is way beyond anything you can imagine.

742
00:56:01,468 --> 00:56:04,179
An ecological disaster, sir.

743
00:56:04,283 --> 00:56:06,681
Plus, the devices themselves
are complicated.

744
00:56:06,785 --> 00:56:09,601
That's why you're coming with us.

745
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:12,989
I am?

746
00:56:13,094 --> 00:56:16,378
You're the expert.
What's your problem?

747
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:20,653
You mean I'm going--
going out there... under the water?

748
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:25,763
Well, earlier today you wanted a gun.
Now you're getting a gun and a wet suit.

749
00:56:25,867 --> 00:56:27,848
Have you ever been
in a combat situation?

750
00:56:28,005 --> 00:56:31,133
- Define "combat," sir.
- Shep?

751
00:56:31,289 --> 00:56:34,104
An incursion underwater
to retake an impregnable fortress...

752
00:56:34,261 --> 00:56:36,972
held by an elite team of U.S. Marines
in possession of 81 hostages...

753
00:56:37,128 --> 00:56:40,673
and 15 guided rockets
armed with V.X. poison gas.

754
00:56:40,778 --> 00:56:45,053
Oh. In that case, no, sir.
Excuse me.

755
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:54,072
- Here.
- Ah, thank you.

756
00:56:56,314 --> 00:56:58,660
You don't look too good.

757
00:56:58,817 --> 00:57:01,423
In fact, you look like shit.

758
00:57:01,528 --> 00:57:05,698
My stomach's doing hula hoops
around my ass.

759
00:57:05,803 --> 00:57:09,609
You all right? I mean,
you gonna make it through this thing?

760
00:57:09,661 --> 00:57:12,007
I don't know.

761
00:57:12,111 --> 00:57:15,135
I always expected something
like this was going to happen,

762
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:17,325
but nothing prepares you for it.

763
00:57:17,377 --> 00:57:20,609
Now I'm--
I'm responsible...

764
00:57:20,766 --> 00:57:23,425
for a whole city.

765
00:57:23,529 --> 00:57:27,439
- Look, I know this isn't easy for you.

766
00:57:27,543 --> 00:57:29,889
Remember, you were trained
for this kind of situation....

767
00:57:29,994 --> 00:57:31,870
and believe me,
it'll come back to you.

768
00:57:31,975 --> 00:57:34,634
Besides, you got the best SEAL team
in the country backin' you up.

769
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:38,179
Okay.
You're right.

770
00:57:39,482 --> 00:57:42,610
I'll be on the wire.
I'll help talk you through it.

771
00:57:42,662 --> 00:57:47,094
There's something else.
It's terrible.

772
00:57:47,198 --> 00:57:51,108
N-No, it's wonderful...
except it isn't.

773
00:57:51,265 --> 00:57:54,966
My girlfriend's pregnant...

774
00:57:55,123 --> 00:57:59,346
and she's...
just flown in to see me.

775
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:02,109
You keep your mind on what you're
going to be doing out there tonight,

776
00:58:02,265 --> 00:58:06,123
and I'll send someone to pick up
your girlfriend and bring her
here to the command center.

777
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:21,868
- Hummel!
- Hello, Frank. Lou Linstrom.

778
00:58:21,921 --> 00:58:25,726
I'm at the White House
with General Kramer.

779
00:58:25,883 --> 00:58:29,637
Uh, Frank, uh, we're havin' a few
problems with the account transfer.

780
00:58:29,741 --> 00:58:32,035
Don't tell me problems,
tell me solutions.

781
00:58:32,139 --> 00:58:36,466
We've spoken to the President,
and I know that you're aware
of his stance on terrorism.

782
00:58:36,623 --> 00:58:40,846
- So what we'd like to do--
- This isn't about terrorism.
This is about justice.

783
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:43,817
It's about reminding people who found it
politically convenient to forget.

784
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:47,884
- This is goin' nowhere, Frank.
- Well, let me tell you what is:

785
00:58:47,988 --> 00:58:50,751
15 V.X. gas rockets into
the heart of San Francisco.

786
00:58:50,856 --> 00:58:53,045
You've got 17 hours
to deliver the money.

787
00:58:53,098 --> 00:58:55,861
Or be prepared to reap
the whirlwind, gentlemen.

788
00:58:59,875 --> 00:59:02,117
What's the word from Mojave?

789
00:59:02,221 --> 00:59:06,913
General Peterson can give us no definite
assurance on the thermite plasma.

790
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:09,103
That is the word.

791
00:59:13,795 --> 00:59:15,724
Green light to SEAL incursion.

792
00:59:33,867 --> 00:59:35,796
Fall in!

793
00:59:35,849 --> 00:59:39,550
All right. Listen up.
Mr. Mason will run point for us.

794
00:59:39,602 --> 00:59:41,740
Lieutenant Shepard will be
attached to his hip.

795
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:46,432
You breathe, he breathes with you.
You piss, he helps. Understood?

796
00:59:48,048 --> 00:59:51,124
Dr. Goodspeed is our specialist.
When he neutralizes the threat,

797
00:59:51,281 --> 00:59:55,139
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.

798
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:58,997
Make no mistake, gentlemen,
we're in the fight of our lives,

799
00:59:59,101 --> 01:00:01,239
against maybe the greatest
battalion commander...

800
01:00:01,343 --> 01:00:03,376
in the Vietnam War,
I shit you not.

801
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,391
Any questions?

802
01:00:07,495 --> 01:00:09,215
Let's load up!

803
01:00:18,391 --> 01:00:20,842
After you, ace.

804
01:00:42,061 --> 01:00:45,971
Pass out and activate
the Minicams.

805
01:00:46,127 --> 01:00:48,473
Everything set here?

806
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:51,184
Minicams operational?

807
01:00:51,289 --> 01:00:54,469
Roger that, sir.
We are on line.

808
01:00:58,379 --> 01:01:02,341
Shep, what's the status on the special
operational gear for Mr. Mason?

809
01:01:05,626 --> 01:01:07,503
Let's see, we have, uh,

810
01:01:07,607 --> 01:01:11,569
one quart of kerosene
and a squeeze bottle,

811
01:01:13,759 --> 01:01:19,442
three washers
and waterproof matches.

812
01:01:19,546 --> 01:01:22,883
Use the green flares to signal
when the threat has been neutralized.

813
01:01:22,935 --> 01:01:26,115
Now, this is atropine.
If you come in contact with the gas,

814
01:01:26,167 --> 01:01:28,565
you have 20 seconds
to inject it into your heart.

815
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:31,068
Don't fuck with me on this.
It may save your life.

816
01:01:34,613 --> 01:01:40,192
I have three incoming bogeys
bearing 2-7-5. Range: 6,000 meters.

817
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:46,031
FBI Command Center?

818
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:49,368
Oh, I would just love for you
to tell me what is goin' on.

819
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:51,766
- Nope.
- Stanley Goodspeed is my boyfriend.

820
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:55,676
- Actually, he's my fiance.
Where is he?
- Classified, lady.

821
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:58,752
Okay, well you just sit here
and act like a Bureau bonehead, then.

822
01:01:58,856 --> 01:02:01,046
Hey, where are you--
Goddamn it.

823
01:02:06,103 --> 01:02:08,606
Decoy choppers commencing
run to Alcatraz.

824
01:02:10,378 --> 01:02:12,620
I just lost one, sir.
I just lost one.

825
01:02:12,672 --> 01:02:15,383
We only got two flying in.
I just lost one.

826
01:02:15,435 --> 01:02:16,634
Shit.

827
01:02:26,123 --> 01:02:29,877
In my day, we did it all
with a snorkel and a pair of flippers.

828
01:02:29,981 --> 01:02:33,109
- Your day?
- Yes, didn't you read my resume?

829
01:02:33,161 --> 01:02:36,133
I don't-- I don't know
anything about you.

830
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:39,000
- I know something about you, Godspell.
- Goodspeed.

831
01:02:39,105 --> 01:02:42,129
Goodspeed,
Godspeed, Godspell,

832
01:02:42,233 --> 01:02:45,622
you never went
to any anti-terrorist school.

833
01:02:45,674 --> 01:02:48,593
So just make sure you don't
get us all fucking killed.

834
01:02:51,409 --> 01:02:54,641
- We're going dark.
- Night vision!

835
01:02:56,309 --> 01:02:58,812
Raider One has dropped
below radar coverage,

836
01:02:58,864 --> 01:03:02,097
heading around Treasure Island.

837
01:03:02,201 --> 01:03:05,537
Sir, we've got two bogeys
bearing due east and closing.

838
01:03:10,542 --> 01:03:12,576
Decoys?

839
01:03:12,628 --> 01:03:15,600
- Prepare to deploy!
- Good luck, Commander.

840
01:03:20,657 --> 01:03:22,638
Sir, Raider One
is at the drop zone.

841
01:03:24,932 --> 01:03:28,112
Stanley's not a very good swimmer.
I mean, he can't even snorkel.

842
01:03:29,363 --> 01:03:31,762
- Everyone, good to go?
- Good to go!

843
01:03:31,866 --> 01:03:35,567
- Good to go!
- Good to go!

844
01:03:44,222 --> 01:03:47,819
So the S.D.U.s have been deployed,
and the Eagles are in the water.

845
01:03:57,621 --> 01:04:00,905
Major, I want the perimeter
patrolled to the west end of the island.

846
01:04:01,062 --> 01:04:03,095
Yes, sir.
Hendrix, you lead the patrol.

847
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:06,640
- Aye, sir.
- Let's move! Move out, move out!

848
01:05:03,416 --> 01:05:06,857
The Eagles are on the Rock.
They've entered the cistern room.

849
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:17,857
Thank you very fucking much, Mr. Mason.
You sent us into a room with no exit.

850
01:05:21,038 --> 01:05:22,967
Any ideas, Dillinger?

851
01:05:23,123 --> 01:05:25,730
Figure it out soon.
We're sitting ducks.

852
01:05:25,886 --> 01:05:29,796
- Real tight on time.
- You stand by the door.
Until I open it.

853
01:05:29,848 --> 01:05:33,133
I'd like to know how you plan
on accomplishing that.

854
01:05:33,185 --> 01:05:35,010
Through here.

855
01:05:41,579 --> 01:05:43,404
You're shitting me.

856
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:47,366
I memorized the timing.
I just hope it hasn't been changed.

857
01:05:47,418 --> 01:05:51,120
You catch one of those
flame bursts, you're a corpse.

858
01:05:51,224 --> 01:05:54,404
- Thank you.
- Commander, you said never
leave his side, but, uh--

859
01:05:54,613 --> 01:05:59,566
- Stand fast, Lieutenant.
- Have a nice day.

860
01:06:21,932 --> 01:06:25,738
- Where'd you dig up this guy?
- That's classified.

861
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,113
Clear here, sir.
No motion sensors tripped.

862
01:06:36,165 --> 01:06:39,814
- Nothing.
- Well, tell them to stay out there.

863
01:06:39,866 --> 01:06:42,160
Sweep forward!

864
01:06:50,919 --> 01:06:53,057
Looks like he fucked us,
Commander.

865
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:56,967
I knew it.
That son of a bitch jumped ship.

866
01:07:02,232 --> 01:07:04,370
Welcome to the Rock.

867
01:07:19,385 --> 01:07:23,347
- Mason.
- That's a no-no. That's the subway.

868
01:07:23,452 --> 01:07:26,945
- That'll drop you into the tunnels.
- Do it!

869
01:07:44,566 --> 01:07:48,060
Sir, the Eagles
have breached the tunnel system.

870
01:07:54,368 --> 01:07:56,870
You enjoying this?

871
01:07:56,923 --> 01:08:00,051
Well, it's certainly
more enjoyable than my average day:

872
01:08:00,103 --> 01:08:04,169
reading philosophy,
avoiding gang rape in the washroom.

873
01:08:04,326 --> 01:08:08,653
Though it's less of a problem these
days. Maybe I'm losing my sex appeal.

874
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:16,421
We've got seismic activity
in one of the storm grates. North side.

875
01:08:16,578 --> 01:08:19,289
Continue patrolling the area.

876
01:08:19,341 --> 01:08:22,625
Sweep forward.

877
01:08:22,677 --> 01:08:25,910
Commander, halt.
We've got movement.

878
01:08:26,066 --> 01:08:28,569
They're hearing sounds above, sir.

879
01:08:28,621 --> 01:08:32,427
Stand fast.
Down, down, down.

880
01:08:37,693 --> 01:08:40,299
West storm drain's clear.

881
01:08:44,679 --> 01:08:48,380
Ninety-seven paces
to the shower room.

882
01:08:52,603 --> 01:08:55,888
The Eagles are now at the access tunnel.
They're right under the shower room.

883
01:09:02,978 --> 01:09:04,594
Fiber optics.

884
01:09:08,505 --> 01:09:12,050
- Something's not right.
- I've got a bad feeling about this.

885
01:09:30,819 --> 01:09:32,852
Quiet.

886
01:09:43,227 --> 01:09:46,094
Motion sensors.

887
01:09:46,199 --> 01:09:50,421
- Beams cutting across manhole covers.
- Deal with it.

888
01:09:54,749 --> 01:09:58,659
Commander, the beam is hitting
some sort of reflective device.

889
01:09:58,815 --> 01:10:00,640
Possibly a prism.

890
01:10:02,882 --> 01:10:06,166
I want to use a mirror
to cut the beam,

891
01:10:06,323 --> 01:10:09,347
send the beam
back to its source...

892
01:10:09,503 --> 01:10:11,536
and then I'm
going to move the prism.

893
01:10:15,968 --> 01:10:18,418
We've got motion on a trembler
in the shower room, sir.

894
01:10:18,575 --> 01:10:20,660
We've got visitors.
Let's move.

895
01:10:23,684 --> 01:10:26,604
Got it. Good to go.

896
01:10:31,661 --> 01:10:33,850
Stand fast.
We'll secure the area.

897
01:10:44,851 --> 01:10:48,292
They're entering
to the shower room, sir.

898
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:53,453
They're securing the area.

899
01:11:01,743 --> 01:11:04,610
Just sit tight.

900
01:11:06,383 --> 01:11:10,241
Drop your weapons!
Drop 'em!

901
01:11:10,345 --> 01:11:12,483
- Get back!
- Hold your fire.

902
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:14,620
Drop your weapons.
Hold your fire!

903
01:11:17,592 --> 01:11:19,312
It's a fucking trap.

904
01:11:21,346 --> 01:11:24,995
This is Gen. Hummel.
Drop your weapons.

905
01:11:25,099 --> 01:11:26,820
Drop 'em!

906
01:11:26,924 --> 01:11:32,607
Anderson here, Gen. Hummel.
Commander. Team leader.

907
01:11:32,659 --> 01:11:35,631
Cmdr. Anderson, if you have any concern
for the lives of your men...

908
01:11:35,735 --> 01:11:38,811
you will order them to safety their
weapons and place them on the deck.

909
01:11:38,863 --> 01:11:40,219
This is not happening.

910
01:11:40,375 --> 01:11:45,797
Sir, we know why you're out here.
God knows I agree with you.

911
01:11:45,849 --> 01:11:50,125
But like you, I swore to defend
this country against all enemies...

912
01:11:50,177 --> 01:11:54,295
foreign, sir, and domestic.

913
01:11:54,347 --> 01:11:58,883
General, we've spilled
the same blood in the same mud.

914
01:11:58,935 --> 01:12:01,855
You know goddamn well
I can't give that order.

915
01:12:01,907 --> 01:12:03,471
We're dead.

916
01:12:03,628 --> 01:12:07,069
Your unit is covered from
an elevated position, Commander.

917
01:12:07,121 --> 01:12:10,874
I'm not gonna ask again.
Don't do anything stupid.

918
01:12:10,927 --> 01:12:13,377
No one has to die here.

919
01:12:13,481 --> 01:12:17,861
Men following the general, you're
under oath as United States Marines!

920
01:12:17,913 --> 01:12:19,842
Have you forgotten that?

921
01:12:21,093 --> 01:12:23,283
We all have shipmates
we remember.

922
01:12:23,387 --> 01:12:26,671
Some of them were shit on
and pissed on by the Pentagon.

923
01:12:26,828 --> 01:12:30,008
But that doesn't give you
the right to mutiny!

924
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:32,876
You call it what you want!
You're down there; we're up here.

925
01:12:32,928 --> 01:12:34,857
You walked into the wrong
goddamn room!

926
01:12:34,909 --> 01:12:37,046
- Stand fast!
- Commander, one last time.

927
01:12:37,099 --> 01:12:39,132
You tell your men
to safety their weapons.

928
01:12:39,184 --> 01:12:41,947
- I cannot give that order!
- I am not gonna repeat that order!

929
01:12:42,051 --> 01:12:44,867
- I will not give that order!
- What the hell is wrong with you, man?

930
01:12:44,971 --> 01:12:47,578
- Stand fast!
- Oh, my God!

931
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:49,611
- Let's waste these fuckers.
- One last time.

932
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:54,251
-Order your men to safety their weapons.

933
01:12:58,943 --> 01:13:00,872
Cease fire!

934
01:13:20,006 --> 01:13:22,561
Don't go.

935
01:13:24,490 --> 01:13:26,367
Cease fire!

936
01:13:35,386 --> 01:13:37,159
Cease fire!

937
01:13:37,367 --> 01:13:41,590
Shit. Goddamn it.
Let go of me. Let go of me!

938
01:13:41,694 --> 01:13:44,093
Don't, don't go.

939
01:14:21,734 --> 01:14:22,934
Fuck.

940
01:14:33,413 --> 01:14:35,342
It's over.

941
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:47,489
Oh, God!

942
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:19,605
- We got some movement.

943
01:15:19,761 --> 01:15:22,785
- Who? Who is it?
- Two of 'em. Eagles 11 and 12.

944
01:15:22,941 --> 01:15:25,600
- It's Goodspeed and Mason.
- I knew it.

945
01:15:25,757 --> 01:15:28,885
I've gotta get a team together.
We've gotta move with the second option.

946
01:15:28,937 --> 01:15:31,075
What, and invite another
massacre? No way.

947
01:15:31,127 --> 01:15:35,141
We've got a 60-year-old convict and
a lab rat. I'm telling you, it's over.

948
01:15:35,298 --> 01:15:37,852
Not for Mason, it isn't.

949
01:15:49,374 --> 01:15:53,389
Goodspeed,
I'm not gonna kill you.

950
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:58,759
- Where are you going?
- Off this bloody island.

951
01:15:58,863 --> 01:16:00,844
What? Wh-- What for?

952
01:16:00,948 --> 01:16:04,546
Goodspeed, do you read me?

953
01:16:04,598 --> 01:16:07,048
It's for you.

954
01:16:08,612 --> 01:16:11,063
- Sir?
- What's the status?

955
01:16:11,115 --> 01:16:13,669
The status is, they're dead.
They're dead!

956
01:16:13,826 --> 01:16:16,068
It's just me and Mason.
Now he says he's leaving.

957
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:19,561
That is unacceptable,
do you hear me? Unacceptable!

958
01:16:19,613 --> 01:16:22,949
Well, there's a problem, sir.
He's got a gun.

959
01:16:23,054 --> 01:16:24,983
What do you have,
a fuckin' water pistol?

960
01:16:25,139 --> 01:16:28,945
- No, sir.
- Go after him and stop him.

961
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:33,324
I didn't want this.

962
01:16:33,377 --> 01:16:36,035
-Jesus, I didn't want this.
- We knew this might happen.

963
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:39,216
- Well, maybe now they'll pay up.
- Maybe now they won't, Captain.

964
01:16:39,372 --> 01:16:41,875
Then maybe we need to execute
a few hostages.

965
01:16:41,979 --> 01:16:44,690
- Got a live one!
- Put a bullet in him.

966
01:16:44,794 --> 01:16:46,827
You heard him, end it.

967
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,861
Holster that sidearm, Captain!

968
01:17:07,369 --> 01:17:09,350
Sir?

969
01:17:12,687 --> 01:17:17,640
You made a terrible mistake. And more
of our brothers have died in vain.

970
01:17:17,692 --> 01:17:21,654
Damn you for forcing me
into this position.

971
01:17:24,886 --> 01:17:27,806
I need to talk to you.
Right now, alone.

972
01:17:27,858 --> 01:17:30,204
Now, you told me
I'm on a need-to-know basis,

973
01:17:30,308 --> 01:17:32,498
and I'm tellin' you right now
I need to know...

974
01:17:32,602 --> 01:17:35,887
who the fuck John Mason is right now.

975
01:17:35,939 --> 01:17:39,849
All right, you wanna know?
1962, J. Edgar Hoover...

976
01:17:40,006 --> 01:17:42,717
is head of the FBI,
some say the country.

977
01:17:42,873 --> 01:17:46,731
It's no secret he kept microfilm files
on prominent Americans and Europeans:

978
01:17:46,888 --> 01:17:50,381
de Gaulle, British members
of Parliament, even the Prime Minister.

979
01:17:50,485 --> 01:17:53,822
I mean, this guy had dirt
on everybody in the world.

980
01:17:53,874 --> 01:17:57,367
Yeah, I know all the cloak-and-dagger
stories. Where does Mason fit in?

981
01:17:57,471 --> 01:18:00,182
Mason was the British operative
who stole the files.

982
01:18:00,286 --> 01:18:03,050
But our Bureau agents caught him
at the Canadian border.

983
01:18:03,102 --> 01:18:06,386
Of course, the British claimed
they'd never heard of him.

984
01:18:06,438 --> 01:18:10,922
And we held him without trial
until he gave up the microfilm.

985
01:18:11,078 --> 01:18:13,060
But he never did.

986
01:18:13,112 --> 01:18:16,344
I'm surprised Hoover didn't
use his daughter as leverage.

987
01:18:16,448 --> 01:18:19,368
Hoover was dead in '72.
She wasn't born yet.

988
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:22,861
Today, well,
it's a different bureau.

989
01:18:22,965 --> 01:18:27,293
So you held this guy without trial
his whole life. No wonder he's pissed.

990
01:18:27,345 --> 01:18:31,724
This man knows our most intimate secrets
from the last half-century:

991
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:36,677
the alien landing at Roswell, the truth
about the J.F.K. assassination.

992
01:18:36,885 --> 01:18:40,743
And Mason's angry, he's lethal.
He's a trained killer.

993
01:18:40,848 --> 01:18:45,696
And he is the only hope
that we have got.

994
01:18:45,905 --> 01:18:50,128
Mason! Mason!

995
01:18:50,232 --> 01:18:53,360
There are 81 hostages
still up there.

996
01:18:53,412 --> 01:18:55,237
Yeah. Like me.

997
01:18:55,341 --> 01:18:57,948
You wanna play tough?
You wanna play tough with me?

998
01:18:58,052 --> 01:19:00,868
Okay, FBI!
Freeze, sucker!

999
01:19:02,171 --> 01:19:06,290
- I'll fire.
- No, you won't.

1000
01:19:06,342 --> 01:19:10,878
- Throw down.
- You're not the sort.

1001
01:19:10,982 --> 01:19:12,859
Let's find out.

1002
01:19:16,352 --> 01:19:19,063
I could; you, no.

1003
01:19:19,115 --> 01:19:22,348
Besides, your safety's on.

1004
01:19:22,504 --> 01:19:26,049
Goodspeed, have you
resolved the situation?

1005
01:19:26,101 --> 01:19:29,594
Not yet.

1006
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:34,860
- He's got all the guns now, sir.
- Shit!

1007
01:19:35,016 --> 01:19:38,092
You're right, I don't use guns,
and I don't kick down doors.

1008
01:19:38,197 --> 01:19:40,439
- This is what I do.
- I haven't got my glasses.

1009
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:44,818
What it says is,
"Chemical Weapons Specialist."

1010
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:46,382
That's right.

1011
01:19:46,434 --> 01:19:49,614
I got a lunatic up there,
man, with 15 missiles...

1012
01:19:49,719 --> 01:19:51,596
armed with some
really funky stuff.

1013
01:19:51,752 --> 01:19:57,383
That lying Womack.
You could've told my daughter.

1014
01:19:57,435 --> 01:20:01,918
It was classified.
Look, I'm in the same situation.

1015
01:20:02,127 --> 01:20:05,255
They've got my girlfriend
in the city with a baby on the way.

1016
01:20:05,359 --> 01:20:08,852
Look, I can defuse the rockets.
I really can.

1017
01:20:09,009 --> 01:20:12,606
But I'm gonna need your help,
and I'm gonna need it right now.

1018
01:20:20,218 --> 01:20:23,033
Sir, this man's weapons
and tac radio are missing!

1019
01:20:23,138 --> 01:20:26,266
Shit, we got a rodent problem.
Flush the pipes.

1020
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:28,925
There's probably a maze of
tunnels on this goddamn island.

1021
01:20:29,029 --> 01:20:31,636
- Check every access you can find.
- Sir!

1022
01:20:37,423 --> 01:20:39,925
Even if you escape
from the island...

1023
01:20:40,029 --> 01:20:42,845
you can't escape the rockets.

1024
01:20:43,001 --> 01:20:45,347
So, where are you gonna go?

1025
01:20:45,451 --> 01:20:48,163
Go where?
What're you gonna do?

1026
01:20:50,926 --> 01:20:53,168
Show me where
the morgue is, Mason.

1027
01:20:53,324 --> 01:20:55,566
I'm out of here.

1028
01:20:57,599 --> 01:21:00,675
What about your daughter? Mason?

1029
01:21:02,604 --> 01:21:04,116
Rodents located.

1030
01:21:04,168 --> 01:21:08,235
The way I see it, you don't
really have any choice, do you?

1031
01:21:08,391 --> 01:21:10,633
I don't think you do.

1032
01:21:22,051 --> 01:21:25,856
Move!

1033
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,444
Ooooh!

1034
01:21:49,630 --> 01:21:53,593
- They're on to us.
- Burn 'em out.

1035
01:21:55,730 --> 01:21:57,972
This mother's gonna blow big.

1036
01:22:39,107 --> 01:22:43,121
I don't understand. How could we lose
radio contact all of a sudden?

1037
01:22:43,226 --> 01:22:45,884
We've lost coms.
Still got 'em on locators.

1038
01:22:53,757 --> 01:22:57,041
- So what's it gonna be?
- What?

1039
01:22:57,094 --> 01:23:01,473
- How do you like your choices?
- I don't.

1040
01:23:01,629 --> 01:23:05,279
That's what I thought.

1041
01:23:05,383 --> 01:23:07,312
Come on.

1042
01:23:07,364 --> 01:23:10,127
This is the oldest part of Alcatraz.

1043
01:23:10,232 --> 01:23:13,881
Did you know it was originally
a Civil War fort?

1044
01:23:13,933 --> 01:23:16,905
Oh, really? Yeah, wow.
You know, I like history, too,

1045
01:23:17,061 --> 01:23:20,137
and maybe when this is over, you and I
can stop by the souvenir shop together,

1046
01:23:20,242 --> 01:23:24,621
but right now, I just-- I just--
I wanna find some rockets.

1047
01:23:24,725 --> 01:23:27,801
Don't tempt me.

1048
01:23:27,853 --> 01:23:31,451
We are going to the morgue.

1049
01:23:53,452 --> 01:23:56,737
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I'll do my best.

1050
01:23:56,841 --> 01:23:59,343
Your best?

1051
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:02,889
Losers always whine about their best.

1052
01:24:02,993 --> 01:24:06,903
Winners go home
and fuck the prom queen.

1053
01:24:08,467 --> 01:24:10,344
Carla was the prom queen.

1054
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:14,098
- Really?
- Yeah.

1055
01:24:15,766 --> 01:24:18,633
Locators have them
approaching the morgue, sir.

1056
01:24:18,686 --> 01:24:21,240
Come on, come on,
you can do it, Doc.

1057
01:24:25,255 --> 01:24:28,904
Shit! Aaaaaah!

1058
01:24:29,113 --> 01:24:31,615
You must never hesitate.

1059
01:24:54,607 --> 01:24:57,474
I think you're shooting
too close to the rocket.

1060
01:24:57,631 --> 01:24:59,873
Him, but not the rocket.

1061
01:24:59,977 --> 01:25:02,688
Any other news, professor?

1062
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:07,745
The rocket!
Not the rocket!

1063
01:25:14,366 --> 01:25:16,608
Aaah! Uhhh!

1064
01:25:22,134 --> 01:25:24,533
I got a little something for ya.

1065
01:25:34,126 --> 01:25:36,576
Yaaaah!

1066
01:25:47,889 --> 01:25:51,904
Uh, yeah, okay, that's just about
the most awful thing I've ever seen.

1067
01:25:53,729 --> 01:25:59,985
Mason... the second you don't
respect this, it kills you.

1068
01:26:00,141 --> 01:26:01,966
Put it over there.

1069
01:26:13,123 --> 01:26:15,990
You've been around a lot of corpses.
Is that normal?

1070
01:26:16,095 --> 01:26:19,327
- What, the feet thing?
- Yeah, the feet thing.

1071
01:26:19,379 --> 01:26:23,863
- Yeah, that happens.
- Can you do something about it?

1072
01:26:24,071 --> 01:26:26,678
Like what?
Kill him again?

1073
01:26:26,782 --> 01:26:29,181
Listen, I'm just a biochemist.

1074
01:26:29,285 --> 01:26:33,612
Most of the time, I work in a glass jar
and lead a very uneventful life.

1075
01:26:33,664 --> 01:26:37,418
I drive a Volvo, a beige one.
But what I'm dealing with here...

1076
01:26:37,574 --> 01:26:41,120
is one of the most deadly substances
the earth has ever known.

1077
01:26:41,328 --> 01:26:43,674
So what do you say
you cut me some friggin' slack?

1078
01:26:59,993 --> 01:27:01,922
A really elegant
string-of-pearls configuration.

1079
01:27:02,078 --> 01:27:04,841
Unfortunately,
incredibly unstable.

1080
01:27:04,946 --> 01:27:07,031
What exactly
does this stuff do?

1081
01:27:07,135 --> 01:27:11,202
If the rocket renders it aerosol, it can
take out the entire city of people.

1082
01:27:11,306 --> 01:27:15,633
Really? What happens
if you drop one?

1083
01:27:15,738 --> 01:27:18,657
Happily, it'll just
wipe out you and me.

1084
01:27:18,814 --> 01:27:22,098
- How?
- It's a cholinesterase inhibitor.

1085
01:27:22,255 --> 01:27:25,539
It stops the brain from sending messages
down the spinal cord within 30 seconds.

1086
01:27:25,591 --> 01:27:28,667
Any epidermal exposure
or inhalation, and you'll know.

1087
01:27:28,824 --> 01:27:33,516
A twinge at the small of your back as
the poison seizes your nervous system.

1088
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:35,236
Do not move that!

1089
01:27:37,739 --> 01:27:40,867
Your muscles freeze,
you can't breathe...

1090
01:27:40,919 --> 01:27:43,943
you spasm so hard you break
your own back, spit your guts out.

1091
01:27:44,047 --> 01:27:49,574
- But that's after your skin melts off.
- My God.

1092
01:27:49,678 --> 01:27:53,014
Well, I think we'd like God
on our side at the moment, don't you?

1093
01:27:53,119 --> 01:27:57,446
So what I'm doing now is removing
the guidance system chips...

1094
01:27:57,550 --> 01:28:00,887
so the rocket'll splash
down after 500 feet.

1095
01:28:00,991 --> 01:28:04,067
All right, let me have that.
You can let go of it.

1096
01:28:04,119 --> 01:28:06,778
All right, just back away.
Just back away!

1097
01:28:06,935 --> 01:28:10,636
Sir, morgue team
has not checked in.

1098
01:28:12,722 --> 01:28:14,859
Blackbird One,
it's Blackbird, over.

1099
01:28:14,911 --> 01:28:19,760
Blackbird One, this is Blackbird.
Come in, goddamn it!

1100
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:25,495
Somebody's still there.
Let's move!

1101
01:28:25,599 --> 01:28:27,945
Rats alive! Close on the morgue!
Close on the morgue!

1102
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:30,031
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

1103
01:28:30,135 --> 01:28:33,576
Frye, Darrow, hustle up.
We got more company!

1104
01:28:37,121 --> 01:28:41,865
Hold it! Converge
on the morgue! Move out!

1105
01:28:41,918 --> 01:28:45,306
Goodspeed, come on.
Come over here.

1106
01:28:45,358 --> 01:28:48,852
Yeah, I love pressure,
I eat it for breakfast.

1107
01:28:48,904 --> 01:28:50,624
Come on. Time's up.

1108
01:28:50,676 --> 01:28:53,857
There's three rockets somewhere else.
We have to find them!

1109
01:28:56,359 --> 01:28:57,298
Come on!

1110
01:28:57,298 --> 01:28:58,862
Come on!

1111
01:29:16,223 --> 01:29:17,735
Clear!

1112
01:29:20,863 --> 01:29:24,252
- I'm too old for this!
- Where's it go?

1113
01:29:24,356 --> 01:29:26,493
I've no idea.

1114
01:29:26,598 --> 01:29:29,204
Sir, all the guidance
chips are gone.

1115
01:29:29,309 --> 01:29:32,280
Captain, I guess you didn't quite
take care of the rat problem.

1116
01:29:32,385 --> 01:29:33,844
No, sir.

1117
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:36,868
Well, there are two dead men who
strongly suggest you go finish the job.

1118
01:29:36,973 --> 01:29:39,579
Yes, sir. Yes, sir!

1119
01:29:47,869 --> 01:29:51,466
-You really don't know where this goes?
-No, I don't know where it goes.

1120
01:29:51,623 --> 01:29:54,855
Well, we're picking up speed.
Do you know how to slow it down?

1121
01:29:54,907 --> 01:29:56,419
No, I don't.

1122
01:30:05,126 --> 01:30:07,368
Aaaaaaah!

1123
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:11,851
Uhhh!

1124
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:24,624
God!

1125
01:30:31,923 --> 01:30:36,094
Mason! You all right?

1126
01:30:36,303 --> 01:30:39,796
Yes, perfectly okay,
you fucking idiot.

1127
01:30:41,829 --> 01:30:43,862
They're coming.

1128
01:30:43,915 --> 01:30:46,469
- Who?
- The marines!

1129
01:30:46,626 --> 01:30:47,720
Where?

1130
01:31:49,814 --> 01:31:53,046
- What the fuck's goin' on?
- Let's cut him off.

1131
01:32:16,403 --> 01:32:17,654
Mason!

1132
01:32:21,304 --> 01:32:23,598
Mason!

1133
01:33:38,829 --> 01:33:44,303
You motherfucker, die, die, die!

1134
01:34:04,740 --> 01:34:08,129
I'm rather glad
you didn't hesitate too long.

1135
01:34:11,257 --> 01:34:15,167
How do you do it?

1136
01:34:15,324 --> 01:34:20,954
Oh, I was trained by the best.
British Intelligence.

1137
01:34:21,059 --> 01:34:23,874
Come on.

1138
01:34:23,978 --> 01:34:29,035
But in retrospect, I'd rather
have been a poet or a farmer.

1139
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:31,173
Okay.

1140
01:34:35,292 --> 01:34:38,628
Okay, the president
arrives in three hours.

1141
01:34:38,733 --> 01:34:42,904
His directive is to string Hummel along
until the air strike is operational.

1142
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:45,093
What's the word
from Mojave, General?

1143
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:50,202
Same as last time, Lou.
They're going as fast as they can.

1144
01:34:54,373 --> 01:34:58,701
Do it over here.
On your knees.

1145
01:35:08,606 --> 01:35:11,943
Navy SEALS, listen up.
You've got something that belongs to me.

1146
01:35:12,047 --> 01:35:14,498
Twelve guidance chips,
to be precise.

1147
01:35:14,602 --> 01:35:19,190
Let me remind you that there are lives
at stake, civilian lives.

1148
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:21,067
Speak up.

1149
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:24,091
- Speak up!
- Oh! I, uh--

1150
01:35:24,195 --> 01:35:26,124
- Uh--
- Tell them your name.

1151
01:35:26,176 --> 01:35:28,366
My name is Larry Henderson.

1152
01:35:28,418 --> 01:35:30,138
Oh, man.

1153
01:35:30,243 --> 01:35:33,058
And I'm a father
of three, and, uh,

1154
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:35,925
they've got a gun to my head.

1155
01:35:36,134 --> 01:35:39,888
You've got exactly three minutes
to return the guidance chips,

1156
01:35:39,992 --> 01:35:42,703
or Mr. Henderson
won't have a head.

1157
01:35:42,807 --> 01:35:45,570
Oh, no. Hey, what--?

1158
01:35:45,622 --> 01:35:51,514
Now, three to go.
You find them and defuse them.

1159
01:35:51,618 --> 01:35:55,528
- Okay? All right.
- All right.

1160
01:35:55,632 --> 01:35:58,969
I'll try and delay Hummel
and give you more time.

1161
01:35:59,126 --> 01:36:02,254
Hey, what about
Mr. Henderson's head?

1162
01:36:04,443 --> 01:36:07,363
Okay. What do you mean?

1163
01:36:12,316 --> 01:36:13,828
Okay.

1164
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:30,511
- General.
- Who the hell are you?

1165
01:36:32,388 --> 01:36:34,734
I'm all that's left
of the enemy.

1166
01:36:48,863 --> 01:36:50,427
Bingo.

1167
01:36:59,290 --> 01:37:01,167
Stand easy.

1168
01:37:03,930 --> 01:37:08,309
Thought I'd been
in the service a long time.

1169
01:37:08,361 --> 01:37:12,637
- Name and rank, sailor.
- It's army, actually.

1170
01:37:12,689 --> 01:37:16,912
Answer the question.
And address him as "General, sir. "

1171
01:37:18,111 --> 01:37:21,343
Captain John Patrick Mason,
General, sir....

1172
01:37:21,447 --> 01:37:23,533
of Her Majesty's S.A.S.

1173
01:37:23,637 --> 01:37:25,358
Retired, of course.

1174
01:37:29,216 --> 01:37:31,979
You're a long way
from home, Captain.

1175
01:37:32,135 --> 01:37:34,742
How the hell are you
involved in this?

1176
01:37:34,846 --> 01:37:37,505
I have a unique knowledge
of this prison facility.

1177
01:37:37,609 --> 01:37:40,529
I was, uh...
formerly a guest here.

1178
01:37:54,501 --> 01:37:57,056
Hi, sweetie.

1179
01:38:03,886 --> 01:38:06,388
Hey, come back here,
little boy.

1180
01:38:08,265 --> 01:38:11,133
Did they bother to tell you
who I am, why I'm doing this,

1181
01:38:11,237 --> 01:38:14,156
or are they just using you
like they do everybody else?

1182
01:38:14,365 --> 01:38:18,119
All I know is you were big in Vietnam.
I saw the highlights on television.

1183
01:38:18,171 --> 01:38:21,872
You wouldn't have any idea
what it means to lead the finest
men on God's earth into battle,

1184
01:38:21,977 --> 01:38:24,219
and then see their memory betrayed
by their own fuckin' government!

1185
01:38:24,375 --> 01:38:29,328
I don't quite see how you
cherish the memory of the dead
by killing another million.

1186
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:33,186
And, uh...
this is not combat.

1187
01:38:33,290 --> 01:38:37,617
It's an act of lunacy,
General, sir.

1188
01:38:37,670 --> 01:38:40,381
Personally, I think
you're a fuckin' idiot.

1189
01:38:46,637 --> 01:38:49,244
"The tree of liberty must be refreshed
from time to time...

1190
01:38:49,348 --> 01:38:52,632
"with the blood of patriots
and tyrants. " Thomas Jefferson.

1191
01:38:52,737 --> 01:38:57,533
"Patriotism is the virtue of
the vicious," according to Oscar Wilde.

1192
01:39:02,590 --> 01:39:04,571
Thank you for making my point.

1193
01:39:04,676 --> 01:39:09,003
Where are the guidance chips?
Where are the guidance chips!

1194
01:39:09,107 --> 01:39:11,349
I destroyed them.

1195
01:39:11,453 --> 01:39:13,278
That was a bad move, soldier.

1196
01:39:13,434 --> 01:39:16,354
Does that mean
you'll execute us both?

1197
01:39:44,247 --> 01:39:47,792
You're lucky that old man
Hummel wants you alive.

1198
01:39:47,948 --> 01:39:50,138
'Cause I'd take pleasure
in guttin' you, boy.

1199
01:39:56,811 --> 01:40:01,920
I'd take pleasure
in guttin' you... boy.

1200
01:40:02,077 --> 01:40:07,551
I'll take pleasure
in guttin' you... boy.

1201
01:40:07,603 --> 01:40:09,480
What is wrong with these
people, huh, Mason?

1202
01:40:09,636 --> 01:40:13,703
Don't you think there's a lot of, uh,
anger floatin' around this island?

1203
01:40:13,807 --> 01:40:17,040
Kind of a pubescent volatility?
Don't you think?

1204
01:40:17,092 --> 01:40:21,367
A lot of angst, lot of "I'm 16;
I'm angry at my father" syndrome?

1205
01:40:21,419 --> 01:40:23,817
I mean, grow up!
We're stuck on an island...

1206
01:40:23,869 --> 01:40:26,841
with a bunch of violence-for-pleasure
seeking psychopathic marines.

1207
01:40:26,945 --> 01:40:29,604
Shame on them!

1208
01:40:31,950 --> 01:40:35,183
Anyway, I only got one chem rod,
and there's two left.

1209
01:40:35,287 --> 01:40:36,851
Mason?

1210
01:40:37,008 --> 01:40:39,354
Yes, I'm here.

1211
01:40:39,406 --> 01:40:42,117
I was just thinking
how wonderful it was...

1212
01:40:42,169 --> 01:40:44,672
when the inmates weren't
allowed to talk in here.

1213
01:40:44,828 --> 01:40:47,487
Not allowed to talk.

1214
01:40:47,591 --> 01:40:49,677
How did you do it?

1215
01:40:49,781 --> 01:40:54,577
Nurtured the hope that there was hope...

1216
01:40:54,629 --> 01:40:58,122
that one day I'd breathe free air.

1217
01:40:58,227 --> 01:41:01,616
Perhaps meet my daughter.

1218
01:41:01,668 --> 01:41:06,099
Modest hopes,
but they kept a man alive.

1219
01:41:06,256 --> 01:41:09,384
What did they put you away for, John?

1220
01:41:09,488 --> 01:41:12,095
Oh, that's a long story.

1221
01:41:12,251 --> 01:41:14,806
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

1222
01:41:14,858 --> 01:41:18,560
When was the last communication
from our men on Alcatraz?

1223
01:41:18,612 --> 01:41:20,854
Seven hours.

1224
01:41:23,356 --> 01:41:26,641
- Thermite plasma is operational.
- Get me the president.

1225
01:41:26,745 --> 01:41:31,385
Be seated. Gentlemen,
consider yourselves on ground alert.

1226
01:41:31,437 --> 01:41:33,940
If we receive launch authority,
your mission is...

1227
01:41:34,044 --> 01:41:36,390
the complete thermal destruction
of Alcatraz Island.

1228
01:41:36,442 --> 01:41:40,613
The entire island is to be blanketed,
not one square inch missed.

1229
01:41:40,665 --> 01:41:45,931
81 American civilians and a number
of U.S. Marines will lose their lives.

1230
01:41:47,703 --> 01:41:52,969
Why didn't you just tell them where the
microfilm was and create a solution?

1231
01:41:53,125 --> 01:41:58,130
The moment they had the
microfilm, they'd suicide me.

1232
01:41:58,183 --> 01:42:01,311
- Some solution.
- You ended up here.

1233
01:42:01,415 --> 01:42:04,856
Which brings me
to another question.

1234
01:42:05,012 --> 01:42:08,453
You broke out-- let me see
if I can get this straight--

1235
01:42:08,557 --> 01:42:12,572
you went down the incinerator
chute, on the mine car,

1236
01:42:12,624 --> 01:42:15,596
through the tunnels
to the powerplant,

1237
01:42:15,752 --> 01:42:19,193
under the steam engine--
that was really cool, by the way--

1238
01:42:19,297 --> 01:42:22,478
and into the cistern
through the intake pipe,

1239
01:42:22,634 --> 01:42:27,326
but how, in the name of Zeus's butthole,

1240
01:42:27,378 --> 01:42:29,360
did you get out of your cell?

1241
01:42:29,516 --> 01:42:33,009
I only ask because
in our current situation,

1242
01:42:33,113 --> 01:42:38,952
well, it could prove to be
useful information, maybe!

1243
01:42:56,679 --> 01:42:59,546
Trade secrets, my son.

1244
01:43:01,371 --> 01:43:02,726
Wow.

1245
01:43:02,883 --> 01:43:05,281
General, two operational
rockets left.

1246
01:43:05,437 --> 01:43:07,783
One at the lower lighthouse
and one at the roof.

1247
01:43:07,888 --> 01:43:11,954
Both of the birds are ready to fly, sir.
General, can you hear me?

1248
01:43:12,058 --> 01:43:15,134
- I heard you, Captain.
-Just makin' sure.

1249
01:43:16,751 --> 01:43:19,722
Should we... prepare
for launch, General?

1250
01:43:21,078 --> 01:43:25,092
- I'll handle the strategy, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

1251
01:43:25,197 --> 01:43:30,306
The hour is approaching, sir. Just
letting the General know of the time.

1252
01:43:30,358 --> 01:43:32,391
I'm very aware
of the time, Captain.

1253
01:43:32,443 --> 01:43:34,737
Aye, aye, sir.
Lettin' you know.

1254
01:43:34,842 --> 01:43:37,501
Me and my boys are cocked,
locked and ready to rock.

1255
01:43:39,847 --> 01:43:41,932
Mason, where are you going?

1256
01:43:42,036 --> 01:43:44,904
Thirty years ago I vowed
I wouldn't die in this toilet.

1257
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:49,387
You're not leaving! There's a madman
in there with his hand on a button!

1258
01:43:49,492 --> 01:43:53,246
Shhh. Some sniper's
gonna get his ass.

1259
01:43:53,350 --> 01:43:56,061
Stop moving, Mason.

1260
01:43:57,468 --> 01:44:00,075
Mason, stop moving.

1261
01:44:00,180 --> 01:44:03,360
Hummel won't do it.
He's a soldier, not a murderer.

1262
01:44:03,516 --> 01:44:05,758
I read it in his eyes.

1263
01:44:05,862 --> 01:44:09,512
Read his eyes? Oh, well,
then everything's just fine!

1264
01:44:09,616 --> 01:44:12,796
- I can't afford to take that chance.
- Why don't you talk louder?

1265
01:44:12,953 --> 01:44:15,403
Three minutes to go, sir.

1266
01:44:17,228 --> 01:44:20,095
- They're not gonna call for it.
- Oh, they'll call.

1267
01:44:20,252 --> 01:44:23,640
They'll call if we fire
one of our rockets up their ass.

1268
01:44:23,693 --> 01:44:26,612
Sir.

1269
01:44:31,357 --> 01:44:34,172
- Hummel.
- Hi, Frank, it's Al Kramer here.

1270
01:44:34,328 --> 01:44:37,091
- How's it going out there?
- How do you think it's going?

1271
01:44:37,196 --> 01:44:40,845
- We're gonna need another hour, Frank.
- You've got three minutes.

1272
01:44:41,002 --> 01:44:45,120
- We have to get authorization
from the president.
- You've got three minutes.

1273
01:44:45,225 --> 01:44:48,666
Frank, please
don't do anything stupid.

1274
01:44:48,822 --> 01:44:52,576
They want another hour.

1275
01:44:52,628 --> 01:44:55,912
That's bullshit. That's bullshit,
General. They're lying.

1276
01:44:56,069 --> 01:45:00,135
They're calling our bluff, sir.
They're playing you for a fool.

1277
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:05,349
Sir, order the launch, General.

1278
01:45:05,505 --> 01:45:09,050
Come on, General,
let's be all we can be.

1279
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:25,630
The mission's not complete!

1280
01:45:25,682 --> 01:45:27,611
Well, mine is.

1281
01:45:27,715 --> 01:45:30,426
When this is over,
you'll go back home,

1282
01:45:30,530 --> 01:45:35,222
driving Carla and your baby
insane in your beige Volvo.

1283
01:45:35,379 --> 01:45:38,924
And I'll be dead, or back in prison
which is the same thing.

1284
01:45:39,028 --> 01:45:43,356
You're not leaving.

1285
01:45:45,858 --> 01:45:49,873
All right...
I'll do it myself.

1286
01:45:51,072 --> 01:45:53,157
I got three weeks'
weapons training.

1287
01:45:53,313 --> 01:45:57,641
I'll kick the--
And a platoon full of marines.

1288
01:45:57,745 --> 01:46:00,508
No problem.

1289
01:46:11,509 --> 01:46:14,793
- Major, patch me into roof battery.
- Aye, sir.

1290
01:46:14,845 --> 01:46:18,808
Fire open control circuit
coordinates to the roof, sir.

1291
01:46:18,860 --> 01:46:21,310
Let's go!

1292
01:46:26,628 --> 01:46:27,879
- Laser powered up.
- Oh, no.

1293
01:46:27,879 --> 01:46:30,382
- Laser powered up.
- Oh, no.

1294
01:46:30,538 --> 01:46:33,354
I said, on your knees!

1295
01:46:33,406 --> 01:46:35,908
My name's Stanley Goodspeed.

1296
01:46:36,065 --> 01:46:38,984
I'm a chemical weapons
specialist for the FBI.

1297
01:46:39,141 --> 01:46:41,070
- Uh, glass or plastic?
- What?

1298
01:46:41,122 --> 01:46:43,624
- Glass or plastic!
- Shut the fuck up!

1299
01:46:43,781 --> 01:46:47,222
Because if the winds change and if you
launch those rockets, we're gonna die.

1300
01:46:47,378 --> 01:46:48,629
Shut up!

1301
01:46:48,681 --> 01:46:52,539
And you're gonna end up
in a glass jar or a plastic bag.

1302
01:46:52,592 --> 01:46:57,753
So do the math, hand over the gun
and let's go find some rockets!

1303
01:46:57,857 --> 01:47:01,142
I said shut the fuck--

1304
01:47:05,886 --> 01:47:09,431
You made the right choice.

1305
01:47:09,536 --> 01:47:13,759
I decided I didn't want your child
growing up without a father.

1306
01:47:13,863 --> 01:47:17,095
Hey, the last time I swam
this channel, I was your age.

1307
01:47:17,252 --> 01:47:20,223
So I'm fucked either way.
So come on.

1308
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:23,195
The weapon is hot.
I am standing by for the launch command.

1309
01:47:23,299 --> 01:47:26,792
Man, killing Navy SEALs is one thing--
Is this for real?

1310
01:47:26,845 --> 01:47:29,556
Hey, it's business.

1311
01:47:32,162 --> 01:47:34,821
Access code entered.
Weapon available for release.

1312
01:47:34,873 --> 01:47:36,802
Launch coordinates:

1313
01:47:36,855 --> 01:47:41,130
six, seven, five, four, five, niner.

1314
01:47:42,798 --> 01:47:44,936
The weapon is hot.

1315
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:47,907
I'm standing by
for launch command.

1316
01:47:48,064 --> 01:47:49,941
It's affirmative.

1317
01:47:56,405 --> 01:47:58,908
Standing by for command.

1318
01:48:06,937 --> 01:48:09,491
I'm waiting for
a launch command, General.

1319
01:48:17,572 --> 01:48:19,553
- Fire.
- Fire!

1320
01:48:25,497 --> 01:48:27,739
Missile loose!
Missile loose!

1321
01:48:33,317 --> 01:48:37,853
Origin: Alcatraz, 67253725.

1322
01:48:38,009 --> 01:48:41,972
- What's the heading?
- Heading 185 degrees south southeast.

1323
01:48:42,128 --> 01:48:45,621
- Speed?
- 300 knots. Headed right at Oakland.

1324
01:48:45,725 --> 01:48:47,342
The football game.

1325
01:48:51,304 --> 01:48:53,077
Oh, my God.

1326
01:49:16,068 --> 01:49:17,841
Missile radically
changing direction.

1327
01:49:24,201 --> 01:49:28,633
New direction: 275 degrees west.
It's headed out to sea, sir.

1328
01:49:28,737 --> 01:49:30,927
Oh, Christ!

1329
01:49:32,491 --> 01:49:36,349
Missile losing altitude.
Falling.

1330
01:49:36,505 --> 01:49:39,842
Falling, 300 feet, 200, 100.

1331
01:49:43,127 --> 01:49:45,994
Bogey detonated underwater.

1332
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:50,373
What the fuck?

1333
01:49:50,530 --> 01:49:53,867
- It missed.
- Well, that's great.

1334
01:49:53,919 --> 01:49:57,516
Extremely great,
but there's still one left.

1335
01:49:57,620 --> 01:50:01,322
What happened to the rocket?
What the fuck happened?

1336
01:50:01,374 --> 01:50:04,763
What the fuck is going on
to the coordinates? Sir! Major!

1337
01:50:04,867 --> 01:50:07,317
Captain, step outside.

1338
01:50:07,370 --> 01:50:10,133
- Talk to me, sir.
- Captain, step outside!

1339
01:50:23,532 --> 01:50:25,721
Get me the Pentagon.

1340
01:50:38,599 --> 01:50:40,997
What the hell was that, Frank?

1341
01:50:42,874 --> 01:50:46,158
- I said, what the hell--
- I heard what you said!

1342
01:50:46,315 --> 01:50:49,287
- I'd appreciate a little more respect.
- Cut the crap, General.

1343
01:50:49,391 --> 01:50:51,633
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not ready to kill these people.

1344
01:50:51,737 --> 01:50:53,822
- Call the Pentagon. Ask for more time.
- No.

1345
01:50:53,874 --> 01:50:56,950
Do it, Frank!
We're coming loose.

1346
01:50:57,055 --> 01:51:00,131
You're coming loose.
The rest of us are in complete control.

1347
01:51:00,235 --> 01:51:03,155
- We're gonna ask for a new deadline.
- Put the phone down.

1348
01:51:03,311 --> 01:51:05,866
- The men are falling apart!
- The men are marines!

1349
01:51:05,918 --> 01:51:09,880
Are they?
I wanna talk to Gen. Kramer.

1350
01:51:09,984 --> 01:51:12,748
- You've been asked by an old friend.
- Put him on the phone right now.

1351
01:51:12,852 --> 01:51:14,937
- You've been ordered.
- This is Major Baxter!

1352
01:51:15,094 --> 01:51:18,378
Now you're being given your last chance
by a man with a gun.

1353
01:51:18,482 --> 01:51:20,620
Put the phone down.

1354
01:51:23,175 --> 01:51:27,554
- I thought you weren't ready to kill.
- I'm warming up.

1355
01:51:27,606 --> 01:51:29,796
At ease.

1356
01:51:38,450 --> 01:51:41,578
They need a decision,
Mr. President.

1357
01:51:47,470 --> 01:51:51,380
These past few hours...

1358
01:51:51,484 --> 01:51:55,811
have been the longest,
darkest of my life.

1359
01:51:55,864 --> 01:51:59,513
How does one weigh human life?

1360
01:52:00,869 --> 01:52:04,309
One million civilians
against 81 hostages.

1361
01:52:04,362 --> 01:52:07,750
And in the middle, Frank Hummel.

1362
01:52:07,855 --> 01:52:12,078
That we have ignored, abandoned...

1363
01:52:12,130 --> 01:52:16,561
or marginalized a great
soldier like Frank Hummel,

1364
01:52:16,613 --> 01:52:19,794
and American boys have paid
for that neglect...

1365
01:52:19,846 --> 01:52:23,287
with blood is equally real...

1366
01:52:23,391 --> 01:52:25,789
and equally tragic.

1367
01:52:28,292 --> 01:52:30,481
We are at war with terror,

1368
01:52:30,638 --> 01:52:34,131
and fighting war means casualties.

1369
01:52:34,235 --> 01:52:37,676
This is the worst call
I've ever had to make.

1370
01:52:41,847 --> 01:52:45,288
Air strike approved.

1371
01:52:47,634 --> 01:52:49,615
Red Thunder to Tower.
Request clearance.

1372
01:52:49,667 --> 01:52:53,056
The amount of firepower
they're gonna drop in there--

1373
01:52:53,108 --> 01:52:56,236
-This is strike leader. Prepared to go.
-It'll be over in a few seconds.

1374
01:52:56,341 --> 01:52:59,156
Flight time to drop point: 17 minutes.

1375
01:53:05,725 --> 01:53:09,114
Excuse me, General, sir,
with all due respect to you.

1376
01:53:09,166 --> 01:53:11,981
- What the fuck is going on?
- You changed the coordinates,
didn't you, General?

1377
01:53:12,138 --> 01:53:15,370
- That's affirmative, Captain.
- So now they think we're gutless?

1378
01:53:15,422 --> 01:53:18,133
The Feds?
They think we won't actually do it.

1379
01:53:18,185 --> 01:53:21,001
They're gonna come at us with
everything they got. Air and sea.

1380
01:53:21,105 --> 01:53:23,451
They're gonna bomb our ass
back to the Stone Age.

1381
01:53:23,555 --> 01:53:25,537
They don't know
we missed on purpose.

1382
01:53:25,641 --> 01:53:30,906
Great. We're not gutless.
We're incompetent. That right?

1383
01:53:31,063 --> 01:53:34,452
I don't think I like your tone, Captain.
We planned for this contingency.

1384
01:53:34,556 --> 01:53:37,528
Load the V.X. into the choppers,
take four hostages and evacuate.

1385
01:53:37,632 --> 01:53:39,874
The consequences of our actions
I'll face alone.

1386
01:53:39,978 --> 01:53:43,158
Excuse me, General, but
what about the fucking money?

1387
01:53:43,315 --> 01:53:45,765
There is no fucking money.
Mission's over.

1388
01:53:45,869 --> 01:53:47,642
Bullshit it's over.

1389
01:53:47,746 --> 01:53:51,239
You're talking to a General, soldier!
Maintain discipline!

1390
01:53:51,344 --> 01:53:56,036
I'm not a soldier, Major. The day
we took hostages, we became mercenaries.

1391
01:53:56,140 --> 01:54:00,937
And mercenaries get paid.
I want my fucking money!

1392
01:54:01,041 --> 01:54:03,595
This mission was based
on the threat of force.

1393
01:54:03,700 --> 01:54:07,349
I'm not about to kill
80,000 innocent people.

1394
01:54:07,506 --> 01:54:10,790
Do you think I'm
out of my fucking mind?

1395
01:54:10,842 --> 01:54:13,918
We bluffed. They called it.
The mission's over.

1396
01:54:17,411 --> 01:54:20,122
Who ever said anything
about bluffing, General?

1397
01:54:20,175 --> 01:54:22,990
Stand down, Captain.

1398
01:54:27,630 --> 01:54:30,758
Stand down, Captain!

1399
01:54:35,346 --> 01:54:40,195
Major, I'm ordering you to take
these men to the choppers and evacuate.

1400
01:54:40,299 --> 01:54:43,688
That's a simple order, Major!

1401
01:54:43,792 --> 01:54:45,877
It's not so simple, Frank.

1402
01:54:46,034 --> 01:54:50,726
Sgt. Crisp, secure the general.

1403
01:54:50,882 --> 01:54:53,802
I'm relieving you
of your command, sir.

1404
01:54:57,556 --> 01:55:00,371
Sergeant!

1405
01:55:06,888 --> 01:55:09,912
- I'll have that sidearm, sir.
- You mean this sidearm?

1406
01:55:18,931 --> 01:55:22,372
Maj. Baxter, you're either with us
or against us.

1407
01:55:27,951 --> 01:55:31,913
It has been the greatest honor
of my life to serve with you, General.

1408
01:55:36,188 --> 01:55:41,349
But like he said... it's over.

1409
01:55:58,867 --> 01:56:01,057
Let's get him.

1410
01:56:06,114 --> 01:56:08,721
Mason!

1411
01:56:09,868 --> 01:56:12,631
My God, what have I done?

1412
01:56:12,787 --> 01:56:16,593
Where's the last rocket?
Where's the last rocket!

1413
01:56:18,366 --> 01:56:21,389
- Where's the last rocket?
- Lower lighthouse.

1414
01:56:21,442 --> 01:56:24,101
- Lower lighthouse!
- Go.

1415
01:56:36,561 --> 01:56:40,263
Darrow, go to the lighthouse!
I'll take care of this fucker!

1416
01:56:46,623 --> 01:56:49,178
One, two, three!

1417
01:56:49,282 --> 01:56:50,794
Eat that!

1418
01:57:05,183 --> 01:57:06,591
Did it.

1419
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:41,417
Come here. Come here,
you little chickensh--

1420
01:57:41,574 --> 01:57:45,067
You shoot me, I drop this.
We're both dead.

1421
01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:47,882
Come on. Come on.
Don't be scared. I won't hurt you.

1422
01:57:47,934 --> 01:57:50,124
- Come on.
- You know how this shit works?

1423
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:52,366
You know how this shit works?

1424
01:57:54,868 --> 01:57:58,466
Come on.

1425
01:57:58,622 --> 01:58:00,655
I don't need a gun.
I'll put it down.

1426
01:58:00,812 --> 01:58:05,139
Come on. Let's play.
Come on. Come on.

1427
01:58:05,243 --> 01:58:09,883
Listen, I think we got started off
on the wrong foot. Stan Goodspeed, FBI.

1428
01:58:09,988 --> 01:58:13,168
Uh, let's talk music. Do you like
the Elton John song, "Rocket Man"?

1429
01:58:13,324 --> 01:58:17,599
- I don't like soft-ass shit.
- Oh, you-- Oh, oh.

1430
01:58:17,756 --> 01:58:22,865
Well, I only bring it up because,
uh, it's you. You're the Rocket Man.

1431
01:58:29,851 --> 01:58:31,885
How do you like
how that shit works?

1432
01:58:31,989 --> 01:58:34,074
Second rocket's away!

1433
01:58:41,842 --> 01:58:43,876
It splashed into the bay, sir.
No detonation.

1434
01:58:44,032 --> 01:58:45,857
Shit.

1435
01:59:06,867 --> 01:59:08,536
Darrow!

1436
01:59:09,943 --> 01:59:11,872
Open up!

1437
01:59:14,792 --> 01:59:16,356
Come on.

1438
01:59:16,565 --> 01:59:18,233
Open up!

1439
01:59:47,064 --> 01:59:49,879
Hey, you mothe-e-e-er!

1440
02:00:23,350 --> 02:00:26,635
Oh, I'm gonna
get you now, baby.

1441
02:00:29,450 --> 02:00:32,057
Okay.

1442
02:00:33,412 --> 02:00:35,863
Got ya. I got you, baby.

1443
02:00:35,915 --> 02:00:38,157
Come on.

1444
02:00:55,622 --> 02:00:57,603
Fucker!

1445
02:01:23,619 --> 02:01:28,102
Red Thunder strike leader.
Time on target: seven minutes.

1446
02:01:44,473 --> 02:01:48,383
English prick.
I tell you my old man was Irish?

1447
02:01:51,198 --> 02:01:53,909
Maintain air speed
4-5-0 knots.

1448
02:01:58,550 --> 02:02:00,739
- Aw, fuck!

1449
02:02:19,873 --> 02:02:22,428
It's me and you, pal!

1450
02:02:22,636 --> 02:02:25,243
I want that fucking chip!

1451
02:02:34,627 --> 02:02:36,608
I love pressure.

1452
02:02:43,855 --> 02:02:47,244
I know you're in here,
and I know you can hear me.

1453
02:02:47,348 --> 02:02:50,320
Now pay the piper
and come out like a man.

1454
02:03:20,246 --> 02:03:22,227
Increase speed to 5-0-0 knots.

1455
02:03:22,383 --> 02:03:25,824
You motherfucker!

1456
02:03:29,787 --> 02:03:33,801
I'm gonna choke my million bucks
out of you! You're gonna die!

1457
02:03:33,853 --> 02:03:36,825
- Eat that, you fucker!

1458
02:04:05,134 --> 02:04:08,628
All right, team inbound.
Time on target: 60 seconds.

1459
02:04:12,642 --> 02:04:16,604
On course heading 1-4-2 degrees.

1460
02:04:24,372 --> 02:04:26,562
When he neutralizes the threat,

1461
02:04:26,614 --> 02:04:29,742
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.

1462
02:04:34,487 --> 02:04:38,188
- Let's tighten up that formation.
- May God have mercy on your souls.

1463
02:04:38,293 --> 02:04:41,421
Please don't let this happen.
There has to be something you can do.

1464
02:04:52,109 --> 02:04:55,132
Let's drop to the deck,
100 feet below radar.

1465
02:05:05,247 --> 02:05:07,593
Target acquired.
Rolling in.

1466
02:05:11,034 --> 02:05:13,797
This is Red Thunder.
Master arm.

1467
02:05:13,849 --> 02:05:16,195
Master armed.

1468
02:05:16,299 --> 02:05:18,802
Time on target: 12 seconds.

1469
02:05:21,357 --> 02:05:24,432
- T.O.T.: ten seconds.
- Please.

1470
02:05:28,551 --> 02:05:30,428
Stay tight, gentlemen.

1471
02:05:32,826 --> 02:05:35,225
I got green smoke.
I got green smoke!

1472
02:05:35,381 --> 02:05:38,613
This is CQ-1, CQ-1. Green smoke!
We have green smoke, over!

1473
02:05:38,822 --> 02:05:40,855
- Gimme that, gimme that. Abort.
- Abort!

1474
02:05:41,012 --> 02:05:43,827
- Flight leader, abort, abort!
-Jesus Christ!

1475
02:05:46,017 --> 02:05:48,623
- I already dropped 'em.

1476
02:05:57,695 --> 02:05:59,468
Oh, goddamn it!

1477
02:06:00,615 --> 02:06:03,638
Oh, my God.

1478
02:06:03,743 --> 02:06:07,340
Get out of my way.
Let me through, please. Let me through.

1479
02:06:10,416 --> 02:06:15,682
The cells did not get hit.
The bombs hit on the back of the island.

1480
02:06:37,579 --> 02:06:40,446
- I'm fed up saving your ass.

1481
02:06:40,550 --> 02:06:42,688
I'm amazed you ever
got past puberty.

1482
02:06:42,792 --> 02:06:47,797
I suppose all this will make
a great bedtime story to tell your kid.

1483
02:06:47,849 --> 02:06:50,717
You're insane, Mason.
The kid'll have nightmares.

1484
02:06:50,873 --> 02:06:53,219
I'll spend all my money
on shrinks.

1485
02:06:53,376 --> 02:06:58,850
Goodspeed, come in. Goodspeed,
Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in.

1486
02:06:59,058 --> 02:07:00,935
Scanning all radio frequencies.

1487
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:03,281
Goodspeed, do you read me?
Come in.

1488
02:07:03,438 --> 02:07:07,556
Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in.

1489
02:07:12,614 --> 02:07:16,628
Goodspeed?
Do you read me? Come in.

1490
02:07:16,784 --> 02:07:18,348
This is Goodspeed.

1491
02:07:20,590 --> 02:07:23,927
Are the hostages alive?

1492
02:07:24,031 --> 02:07:26,065
Every one of 'em.

1493
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:33,364
Goodspeed, it's Womack.
What about Mason?

1494
02:07:40,871 --> 02:07:42,748
He's dead, sir.

1495
02:07:42,852 --> 02:07:46,658
- How? When?
-Just come and get me.

1496
02:07:49,161 --> 02:07:51,246
Womack tore up your pardon, John.

1497
02:07:51,350 --> 02:07:55,052
But of course. I knew he would.

1498
02:07:55,104 --> 02:07:58,441
The S.D.U.s and the scuba gear
should still be where we came ashore.

1499
02:07:58,545 --> 02:08:00,787
If you can get
to the Pan Pacific Hotel,

1500
02:08:00,891 --> 02:08:03,289
there's clothes in my closet
and $200 in the bible.

1501
02:08:03,341 --> 02:08:05,323
Room 26.

1502
02:08:05,375 --> 02:08:10,223
Well, it's been a long time
since I've said thank you to anybody.

1503
02:08:10,380 --> 02:08:12,882
But thank you.

1504
02:08:15,072 --> 02:08:20,077
Well, Stanley, uh, this is when we go
our separate ways, huh?

1505
02:08:21,641 --> 02:08:26,177
Uh-- I'm sure you know the etymology
of your name, "Goodspeed. "

1506
02:08:26,281 --> 02:08:30,504
Yeah, "Godspeed. " To wish someone
a prosperous journey. Why?

1507
02:08:30,608 --> 02:08:33,528
Well, if you fancy a journey,

1508
02:08:33,684 --> 02:08:37,490
I recommend Fort Walton, Kansas.

1509
02:08:37,594 --> 02:08:39,680
I was thinking of Maui.

1510
02:08:39,784 --> 02:08:41,817
No.

1511
02:08:46,405 --> 02:08:49,429
Forget Maui.

1512
02:08:54,851 --> 02:08:58,292
"St. Michael's Church,
Fort Walton, Kansas.

1513
02:08:58,344 --> 02:09:01,368
"Front pew, right leg.

1514
02:09:01,472 --> 02:09:03,662
Hollow."

1515
02:09:03,819 --> 02:09:07,103
Is this what I think it is?

1516
02:09:08,667 --> 02:09:11,326
Mason?

1517
02:09:25,142 --> 02:09:28,374
- Congratulations,
Dr. Goodspeed. You did it.
- Thank you, sir.

1518
02:09:28,426 --> 02:09:31,763
You know, for a while there,
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

1519
02:09:31,867 --> 02:09:35,517
Well done, son.
So, where's Mason?

1520
02:09:35,621 --> 02:09:39,688
Vaporized.
Blown out to sea.

1521
02:09:39,792 --> 02:09:42,138
Blown out to sea, huh?

1522
02:09:42,242 --> 02:09:43,598
Yeah.

1523
02:09:43,754 --> 02:09:46,570
Poor bastard.

1524
02:09:49,906 --> 02:09:52,357
Goodspeed, where's Mason?
Where's his body?

1525
02:09:52,409 --> 02:09:54,859
I wanna see
that son of a bitch.

1526
02:09:55,016 --> 02:09:57,935
Vaporized, sir.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1527
02:09:58,039 --> 02:10:03,357
What? Vaporized?
A body can vaporize?

1528
02:10:03,409 --> 02:10:06,381
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely, sir.
