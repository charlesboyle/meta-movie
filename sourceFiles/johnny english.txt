Thank you very much for waiting.

Now, the question that faces us
this morning is a simple one.

Namely, how did the thieves gain access
to this highly secure environment...

with thejewels afterwards?

- Uh, please, Bough. My mind is at work.

is that the master criminal...

but a series of opportunities.

257
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:54,043

- Should I drop down from the ceiling?
- Actually, sir--

There's one thing I think
we can be fairly confident about,

261
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:07,519
that is that they didn't
come up through the floor--
