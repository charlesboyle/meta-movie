1
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,799
l truly don't even know
why I'm here doctor.

2
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,759
Well of course it's difficult
running a large household by one self...

3
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,759
and raising four children is exhausting.
But they're wonderful, wonderful children.

4
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,999
And my husband...

5
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,679
he's a good man. A very hard worker.

6
00:01:28,518 --> 00:01:29,782
And huuu...

7
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:31,265
[clears throat]

8
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:33,441
There were...there is just...one thing...

9
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,039
Sometimes at night...

10
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,959
and it comes to me.

11
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,959
l imagine myself...

12
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,959
splitting his fat, bold head

13
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,919
with a great large axe.

14
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,279
lt's just a feeling that comes over me
many...many times a day...

15
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,839
a feeling of humm...

16
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,399
expectation, aah...

17
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,679
hungering.

18
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,216
[Crying]

19
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,359
How do you bear it, this English weather?

20
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,999
l cannot sing from the sadness.

21
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,799
I open my mouth...

22
00:02:16,493 --> 00:02:17,774
[Sing terribly]

23
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,799
You see?
Nothing.

24
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:21,808
[Sobbing]

25
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,670
[Continues crying]

26
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,877
Well and with my dear Allister's gone
it's two years now l...

27
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:33,638
l should thought l'm far,
far too old for this kinds of feelings...

28
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,519
but well, there they are...

29
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,959
Nurse!

30
00:03:59,332 --> 00:04:01,730
l ask you to clean this wound
and put on fresh bandages.

31
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:02,200
Umm...

32
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,999
Dr. Richardson told me

33
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,639
not to waste supplies.

34
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,999
ls he mad? No...

35
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,159
We must keep the wound
clean to prevent sepsis.

36
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,439
- What 'sis'?
- Sepsis.

37
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,479
lnfection. lt's caused by germs

38
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,039
entering the wound.

39
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,119
Germs. They're tiny creatures

40
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,639
that invade the body.

41
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,559
Causing pain, fever,

42
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,679
infections.

43
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,759
l don't think l have those.

44
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,959
-You can't see them.

45
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,439
They're invisible.

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,855
Please, just fetch me a beaker of carbolic acid solution and fresh bandage.

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,959
Yes, doctor.

48
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,839
Honestly...

49
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:45,957
ugh...That oaf Richardson had this way
with perform surgery in the sewer

50
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,170
using rusty saws

51
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:49,559
and it would be Beekman's pills for everybody.

52
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,119
no matter the ailment...

53
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,082
-Granville.

54
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,863
l'm aware l specifically told the nurse
not to change these bandages.

55
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,679
Soiled bandages are a heaven for germs.

56
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,279
Germ's theory is poppycock, Granville.

57
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,879
Now stop speaking of it.
You're frightening the patients.

58
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,159
Poppycock? But Lister has proved it.
All the latest journals...

59
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,559
-Tight, Granville.

60
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,519
No, we won't be needing those.
Thanks very much.

61
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,519
A study there of calm reassurance

62
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,439
and regular bleeding.

63
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,319
These are the keys to modern medicine.

64
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,942
Will you remain calm, when the
leg putrefies  and become gangrenous?

65
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,999
When you amputate...

66
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,799
when the rots spread to her blood and kills her?

67
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,479
l've had quite enough
of your impotence.

68
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,049
Put back that bandage and bleed a pint.

69
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,959
Look...look at her, man.
You...you get more blood out of a turnip.

70
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,759
Do as you're told.

71
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,559
And give her Beekman's pills for insurance.

72
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,860
Beekman's pills are rubbish.

73
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:45,538
They will do nothing but
bring on stomach cramps.

74
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,839
l won't stand here and watch you murder your patients

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,839
just because you can't be bothered
to read the latest science.

76
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,304
Hahahahaha...

77
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,799
At long last

78
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,319
we agree, Granville.

79
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,199
Bloody dinosaur.

80
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,108
Oh...

81
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,570
Huh...

82
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,039
Good day Mrs. Copeland.
ls Edmund in?

83
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,199
l wouldn't know, sir.

84
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,599
Guess it all knows my part is
delivery stay at night.

85
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,901
If I didn't love his parents so, I'd never stay.

86
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:44,832
I'd pack my bags,

87
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,214
and all this electrical equipment.

88
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:48,581
lt's a fire hazard, that's what it is.

89
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,039
I'll try his study.

90
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,519
You. Why have you stopped?

91
00:06:53,327 --> 00:07:01,124
[lndistinct chatter]

92
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:08,225
Ow!

93
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,400
Now, that is not what you're supposed to do.

94
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:14,110
[Door opens]

95
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,359
Hello.

96
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,732
[Humming]

97
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,200
Ahhh...

98
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,039
Oh no.

99
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,759
You haven't been sacked again, have you?

100
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,959
l've tell you, Edmund.
The healing arts in England are positively lethal.

101
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,519
lt's no coincident that the morgues
are placed adjacent to the hospitals.

102
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,130
-Ahh...

103
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,327
Well, this is 1880's.

104
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,340
We're meant to be in the midst of a medical revolution.

105
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,919
ls it asking too much to use just
a bit of what science has provided.

106
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,399
Rather than...go about indiscriminately killing people?

107
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,519
Yeah, well it's little bit like that.

108
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,759
What's all the fuss outside?

109
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,679
My new generator.

110
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,479
You purchase a generator
just last year.

111
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,559
Obsolete. This is half the size
and leavess double the power.

112
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,479
l never thought I'd say this. But...

113
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,959
l've lost hope.

114
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,959
Since l was a boy, all l wanted was
to practice medicine.

115
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,199
And to help...

116
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,079
people that actually needed it.

117
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,479
But l'm beginning to fear
that the world is set against me.

118
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,559
Well, what you gonna do?

119
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,999
Private practice, l suppose.

120
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,759
I shall harness myself
to some greedy pill pusher.

121
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,759
Shut my mouth.
And pray that it nets me a steady income.

122
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,479
Or, I could give you ten thousand pounds,
so you could whatever you wish.

123
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,839
uhh...I've told you a thousand times, Edmund.

124
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,180
You and your family done
quite enough for me already.

125
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,319
Oh, come on, Mortimer.
l'd hardly miss it.

126
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,999
That's not the point.

127
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,239
I simply must make my own way in the world.

128
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,359
You're so wonderfully middle class.

129
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,199
Haha..

130
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,079
Thank you.

131
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,799
Oh, by the way.
There seems to be a young man

132
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,439
sleeping on your stairs.

133
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,399
Really?

134
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,650
Huh...

135
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,439
[Clear throat]
Good Morning.

136
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,999
Mortimer Granville to see Dr. Dalrymple.
l have an appointment.

137
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,159
He's with someone now.

138
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,559
l see. Very well.

139
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,079
l shall wait, then.

140
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,199
Ladies.

141
00:10:17,637 --> 00:10:18,700
Ladies.

142
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,611
Umm...

143
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:36,240
Ahh...

144
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:39,873
It's lovely.

145
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,039
Japanese, I think.

146
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,639
You're a charlatan...

147
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,039
with no more idea

148
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,804
of a woman's wants or needs than

149
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:19,519
of...of the Moon's atmosphere.

150
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,055
Charlotte, I simply want you to behave...

151
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:25,323
You may be unaware, but there is a social revolution of foods.

152
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,761
Women, will no longer be denied our rightful place.

153
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,046
Try, as you might.
To keep us in a kitchen and in a drawing room.

154
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,750
We will not rest.

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,679
Until we are welcome in the universities,

156
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,679
in the professions and in the voting booth.

157
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,679
What are you staring at?

158
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,319
Yes, l can see the wheels turning.
Pity l can't stay for the pronouncement.

159
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:56,285
Charlotte!

160
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,119
That woman was...

161
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,919
Hysterical.

162
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,879
Yes, quite.

163
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,639
lt's a very difficult case, that one.

164
00:12:05,702 --> 00:12:06,474
Huh...

165
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,359
I have worked at a number
of hospitals in the past...

166
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,759
year.

167
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,776
Guy's of course, Charing Cross.

168
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,199
The Westminster Hospital, most recently...

169
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,479
Excellent.

170
00:12:17,382 --> 00:12:17,759
-St Thomas's

171
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,559
Old St Thomas's

172
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,079
The popular Stepney sick asylum...

173
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,799
Good. Impressive.

174
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,759
...the diseases of the chest. Royal Sea Bathing Infirmary...

175
00:12:25,944 --> 00:12:27,119
Fine...fine.

176
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,949
lt's...lt's a variety of experiences.

177
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:32,319
But, tell me doctor...

178
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,900
what do you know of hysteria?

179
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:35,823
Huh...

180
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,799
Nothing.

181
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,199
Nothing?

182
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,225
But it's a plague of our time.

183
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,719
I would venture to say,
that half the women in London are affected.

184
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,999
lt stands from an overactive uterus.

185
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,439
In its most severe forms,
it demands drastic measures.

186
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,839
institutionalization, surgery even.

187
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,199
But in it's mildermanifestations:

188
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,519
Nymphomania, frigidity,
melancholia, anxiety,

189
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,999
it's eminently treatable.

190
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,959
Interesting.

191
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,119
Look. l'll come straight to the point, doctor.

192
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,879
I'm keen for help.

193
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,159
Oh, you saw my waiting room.

194
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,719
Not enough hands to do the work, so to speak.

195
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,279
Sir, I would be enormously grateful

196
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,576
for any position that allowed me
to offer relieve to my patients

197
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,639
with little chance of killing them.

198
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,199
I've treated thousands of cases,
and l've not lost a single patient.

199
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,599
But I won't lie to you, Granville.

200
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,200
lt's tedious, tiring work.

201
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,159
Are you fit?

202
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,999
I have never shook from hard work in the
pursuit of helping the most needy among us.

203
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,679
Jolly good.

204
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,679
Shall we say, umm...three pounds a week?

205
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,938
Three pounds?

206
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,639
Four.
Plus food and lodging.

207
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,959
I accept.

208
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,479
We're going to do great things together, Granville.

209
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,919
Good God, what a grip.

210
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,119
So, breakfast at eight, dinner at six.

211
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,099
Your room is up...ahh...

212
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,239
Emily.

213
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,919
I want you to meet my new assistant.

214
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,119
Dr. Mortimer Granville.

215
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,559
My daughter, Emily Dalrymple.

216
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,959
Your servant, ma'am.

217
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,039
So pleased to meet you, Dr. Granville.

218
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,559
Emily is the angel of the house.

219
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,999
Since the day that my wife, Melodia, passed away,
Emily has run things in proper order.

220
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,879
Oh, and she's also quite a scientist in her own right.

221
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,359
You boast, Father.

222
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,359
Let me guess.

223
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,159
Jollyty?

224
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:34,584
[Both chuckles]

225
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:35,999
Botany?

226
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,039
Lepidopterology?

227
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,800
Phrenology.

228
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,253
-Phrenology...hahahaha...Yes.

229
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,439
l can assure you Phrenology
is an accurate science, doctor.

230
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,919
Yes. Besides emulation of the bump

231
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,719
someone's head's a varied road map to the personality,

232
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,159
if one is properly trained to read them.

233
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,439
l don't mean to imply...

234
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,039
l think a demonstration is in order

235
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,599
for our young sceptic.

236
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,039
it could be the most convivial.

237
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,639
Please.

238
00:15:25,245 --> 00:15:26,245
What...

239
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,959
Dr. Granville, you had the most
perfectly formed nimbus l've ever felt.

240
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,759
nimbus?

241
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,399
He is a man of great wisdom.

242
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,319
l knew it. l knew it

243
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,439
And your mastoid is...is very well pronounced.

244
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,479
Doctor, you're quite sympathetic, aren't you?

245
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,719
Umm...well...

246
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,079
What else...what else?

247
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:42,600
Oh...

248
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,100
Oh, I'm so sorry.
-What?

249
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,000
lt's just...

250
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,999
Well your...your thrombus is so...rigid,

251
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,600
so jotting and prominent, it startled me.

252
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,222
Rigid thrombus?

253
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,678
Sorry. Rigid thrombus?

254
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,599
it augurs fame.

255
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:57,696
No, no, no...

256
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,759
While l have the utmost respect for your method, Miss Dalrymple

257
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,999
l must complaint that you misread me.
l'm but a simple doctor.

258
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,239
l have no ambition for notoriety.

259
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,879
And l can assure you, your thrombus is the key to you future.

260
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,039
Whether you seek it or not, Dr. Granville.

261
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,159
You're destined for fame.

262
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:16,847
Ahoy!

263
00:16:18,095 --> 00:16:19,095
Ahoy!

264
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,239
Who is this?

265
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,319
Who is this, please?

266
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,000
Mr. Stanton...Huh.

267
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,159
Can you hear me?

268
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,799
Can you hear me now?

269
00:16:31,718 --> 00:16:32,718
Yes.

270
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,201
This is Edmund St. John Smythe.

271
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,079
No, I don't work at
the telephone exchange. You see...

272
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,141
l've installed this telephone and l wanted to test it

273
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,212
you're the only person
they could connect me to. Haha...

274
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,533
How're things going over there?

275
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,536
Sound's thrilling. Very well.
Carry on then. Goodbye.

276
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,719
Do you realize?
l have been speaking to a barrister

277
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,439
on the other side of London.

278
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,399
What about it?

279
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,719
Nothing. l don't even know the job.

280
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,479
Nothing to value if you
have nothing to speak about.

281
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,639
Here l am in Grosvenor Square,
and he's miles away

282
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,319
yet, we're able to speak
to each other instantaneously.

283
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,556
Do you think they'll catch on?

284
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,959
l have no idea.
But imagine if everyone had one.

285
00:17:09,786 --> 00:17:10,786
Right.

286
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,359
Well...

287
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,993
l have just been offeedr a position
by London'0s leading specialist in women's medicine.

288
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:18,993
Oh, God...

289
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,039
How ghastly for you.

290
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,199
When do you start?

291
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,559
Tomorrow.

292
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,032
Quite looking forward to it, actually.

293
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,079
Who is she?

294
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,079
What?

295
00:17:31,337 --> 00:17:32,337
Hmm?

296
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,562
She's his daughter.

297
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,839
Emily Dalrymple.
l've only met her briefly, but...

298
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,759
But what?

299
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,239
Oh, Edmund. She is magnificent.

300
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,159
The epitome of English virtue and...

301
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,319
Womanliness.

302
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,239
I haven't the hope.

303
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,079
Huh. Handsome, young doctor.
What more could a woman ask?

304
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,639
Huh, better income. Social equal.

305
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,679
Overrated.

306
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,439
A few laughs, stiff pricks. That's all a woman wants.

307
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,999
And you know this because?

308
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,199
Oh, l've read it in a magazine.

309
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,319
Oh, l see.

310
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,279
A toast then. To the end of
Dr. Mortimer Granville, once a brilliant student,

311
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,719
most recently, a visionary doctor to the poor,

312
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,359
and now, handmade to anxious middle-aged women.

313
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,119
Edmund St. John Smythe.

314
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,359
Bachelor.

315
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,439
Benefactor. Miserable student.

316
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,479
Sometimes drunkard.
Full time sexual deviant and

317
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,159
supreme waster of time and money,

318
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,879
especially if it has anything to do with the science of electricity.

319
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,079
- To the telephone.
- To the Queen.

320
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,159
To calling the Queen on the telephone.

321
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,399
Morning, Mrs. Parsons.

322
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,679
Oh, good morning, Doctor.

323
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,959
This is Dr. Granville.

324
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,599
He'll be assisting me this morning.

325
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,358
Very pleased to meet you, Mrs. Parsons.

326
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,012
Doctor...

327
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,079
Notice the general pallor.

328
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,439
And how are we
this morning, Ms. Parsons?

329
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,759
Still feeling anxious?

330
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,639
yes, quite anxious, doctor.

331
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,999
I've been having those distracting thoughts we discussed all week.

332
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,079
Yes.

333
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,159
Throughout history,

334
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,519
the medical establishment just
offered hysterical women

335
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,079
a veritable small respond order of treatments.

336
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,879
Warm baths, ice baths, water jets,

337
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,439
mesmerisation,

338
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,719
horseback riding even.

339
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,319
But, l favour

340
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,879
a more direct approach.

341
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,045
Now, l like to begin

342
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,839
with a drop of musk oil...

343
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,519
followed by oil of lilies.

344
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:37,841
good dollop.

345
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,679
Are you ready, Mrs. Parsons?

346
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,658
Yes...yes, doctor. Quite ready.

347
00:19:48,117 --> 00:19:49,117
Ooh...

348
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,079
Now, you begin with the index finger.

349
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,999
Applying gentle pressure.

350
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,679
And slowly...

351
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,479
slowly in a circular motion,

352
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,839
still pressing gently.

353
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,239
lt's a bit like tapping your head
and rubbing your tummy at the same time.

354
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,719
But you certainly get the hang of it.

355
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,399
Vulva massage was popularized by Pieter Van Forest in the 16th century.

356
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,959
Who prescribed it
most especially for widows

357
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,159
and women of religious orders.

358
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,199
- No offense, Mrs. Parsons.
- None taken, Doctor.

359
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,479
But today, in a clinical
environment with a trained professional

360
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,719
this is the most direct,
most effective treatment we can offer.

361
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,559
Good steady pressure.
That's the key.

362
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,199
Oh...Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

363
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,839
Of course,
reapply oil as needed.

364
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,239
Notice the effect, Doctor?

365
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,239
Shortness of breath.

366
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,039
Blushing of the skin.

367
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,719
Fluttering of the eyelids,

368
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,799
twitching.

369
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,919
Mourn crimson.

370
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,279
Vocalization. All perfectly normal.

371
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,719
Merely, involuntary
physiological reaction to the treatment.

372
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,759
Oh...Oh, come on!

373
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,959
Come on, boy!

374
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,999
Up and over!

375
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,879
Steady on, Mrs. Parsons. Steady on.

376
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,919
Put steady pressure.

377
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,239
That's the key of it all.

378
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,679
Tally-ho!

379
00:21:19,138 --> 00:21:20,138
Tally-ho!

380
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,207
Steady she goes, Mrs. Parsons.

381
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,559
Steady she goes

382
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:29,180
ls she's by fierce external stimulation,
we're able to elicit the pain pleasure reaction,

383
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,519
there by inducing the hysterical paroxysm,

384
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,079
and causing the uterus back to its normal position.

385
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,519
Amazing.

386
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,719
The female organ is as you know

387
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,799
incapable of experiencing
any pleasurable sensation what so ever

388
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,759
without actual penetration,
of the male organ.

389
00:21:45,018 --> 00:21:46,018
Arghhh...

390
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,679
As you can see, Granville.

391
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,239
A very satisfactory paroxysm.

392
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:02,639
Well, l think we can judge this treatment a great success,
What do you say, Mrs. Parsons?

393
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,999
Startling, Dr. Dalrymple.

394
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,959
How a full demonstration.

395
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,679
And those nagging thoughts?

396
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,799
Gone, Doctor.

397
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,959
Wonderful.

398
00:22:16,642 --> 00:22:17,642
Wonderful.

399
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,919
So, same time next week.

400
00:22:19,778 --> 00:22:20,778
Umm...

401
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,279
Same time tomorrow, l should say.

402
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,290
Moderation in all things, Mrs. Parsons.

403
00:22:27,324 --> 00:22:29,200
Moderation in all things.

404
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,439
ls that you, Sarah?

405
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,959
Hello.

406
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,119
Ow...missed me, Charlie!

407
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,319
Sauce, sir?

408
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,079
It's lovely with the fish.

409
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,119
Thank you.

410
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,519
My father was the Anglican minister
of Mortlake.

411
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,359
Unfortunately, he and mother
perished in the last cholera outbreak.

412
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,919
when l was a boy.

413
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,959
After coming to London to volunteer,
they contracted the disease themselves.

414
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,519
Oh, how dreadful.

415
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,679
Oh, terrible.

416
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,999
No doubt that's where you came your interest in medicine.

417
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,999
Lord St. John Smythe,
knew of my fate and without thought of the cost,

418
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,599
brought me into his own home
and provided for my welfare and education.

419
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,319
Just what you'd expect from a man of his standing.

420
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,919
There is no greater charity
than the gift of education.

421
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,559
You read the book of Samuel Smiles?

422
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,519
ls there anyone more sensible,
more supremely British.

423
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,759
Quite.

424
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,279
Music, philosophy,

425
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,319
phrenology,

426
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,359
you're woman of many talents MissDalrymple.

427
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,133
lt's through generosity, through compassion,

428
00:24:03,134 --> 00:24:05,159
through simple Christian kindness,

429
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,559
and England gospel is spread
through all those who hunger...

430
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,279
Hello, Father.

431
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,239
l'm so sorry l'm late.

432
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,237
Charlotte...

433
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,239
Emily, hello. Love you.

434
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,439
Good evening, Charlotte.

435
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,959
Molly, hello?

436
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,319
Staying out of trouble, l heard?

437
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,959
Most days, miss. Wine?

438
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,159
Yes, please.

439
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,959
You remember my daughter, Charlotte Dalrymple...

440
00:24:23,882 --> 00:24:26,177
Daughter?
-My new assistant, Dr. Mortimer Granville.

441
00:24:26,178 --> 00:24:28,239
Oh, hello. Lovely to meet you properly.

442
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,029
Careful not to prick yourself, Doctor.

443
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,030
What...oh!

444
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,679
You are aware that the dinner begin at six.

445
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,159
l'm so sorry.

446
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,519
Lizzie Burke had her eighth baby today. A little girl.

447
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,359
She was turn the wrong way
around, it took forever to get her out.

448
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,799
It was unbelievable.

449
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,559
Must we speak of such things at table?

450
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,919
Emily.

451
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,759
Dr. Granville.

452
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,239
How is your fish?

453
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,879
Very fresh and very flaky, thank you.

454
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,479
And Emily, are the parsnips to your liking?

455
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,799
Oh...that's enough, Charlotte.

456
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,719
Only trying to make the conversation sufficiently benign.

457
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,799
Dr. Granville

458
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,959
What say you?

459
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,039
Childbirth. Nasty, uncomfortable
topic best avoided at supper

460
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,279
or a miracle of life suited for any setting?

461
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,839
l believe that serious medical matters,
are best left to those who're trained in them.

462
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,679
The lane Doctor remind me,
but can only study his scalpel with a quart of gin.

463
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,639
What say you, then?

464
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,199
Charlotte is the mistress at the
Eastern Settlement, House of Heaven for the less fortunate.

465
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,399
yes, unfortunately,
the experience's left her without a sense of

466
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,999
punctuality or decorum.

467
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,759
Oh, that's probably true.

468
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,079
l suppose l should've said to Lizzie,
"Hold tight darling,

469
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,679
won't be a minute. Just got to pop home.
Mustn't be late for supper"

470
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,599
l don't know why you bother coming here at all

471
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,919
if your sole intention is to be disruptive.

472
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,679
lt isn't my sole intention.

473
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,839
We're out of coal again
and l need ten pounds.

474
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,279
No, no, no, no.

475
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,908
I already told you yesterday,
l'm not giving you any further support in that regard.

476
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,079
l know you did but
l didn't think you mean it.

477
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,559
Well if that what it takes to
bring to your senses, so be it.

478
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,519
l've been dodge you too long.

479
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,559
l've allowed you to roam the
street of London late at night.

480
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,719
Streets that l would be frighten
to go into in broad daylight.

481
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,239
l've taken into my own home the employer...

482
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,397
inexperience maid at your request. But no more.

483
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,439
Then father please give me my dowry.

484
00:26:19,318 --> 00:26:20,318
Haha...

485
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,131
What...To be wasted on
prostitutes and factory workers? l don't think so.

486
00:26:24,132 --> 00:26:25,119
No, no. Not until you marry.

487
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,439
I would rather offer
myself to a band of ravenous Cossacks.

488
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,439
-The parsnips are delicious. Are they not?

489
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,079
l do find they work wonderfully
with the fish. Don't you think?

490
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,559
it's not the Middle Ages.
She will able to marry whoever she pleases.

491
00:26:37,788 --> 00:26:39,639
No! lt's not proper.

492
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,319
Now you give up this settlement house
and step up to your responsibility.

493
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,199
And until you do so,
l will not give you another penny.

494
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,559
And l won't come here anymore.

495
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,639
Not the charity or the company.

496
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,359
And you may threaten me with privation, with bankruptcy,

497
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,799
with a life that knows only hunger and squalor.

498
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,919
But l shall never veer, from what l know

499
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,279
to be my own true path.

500
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,439
And don't slam...

501
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,159
Does she slam every door?

502
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,159
Very difficult case, that one.

503
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,839
Good night, Doctor.

504
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,839
How is it, Miss Dalrymple that...

505
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,079
you are so much the ideal one.

506
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,719
And your sister is so...

507
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,599
so volatile?

508
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,399
well, l'm hardly ideal, Doctor. And...

509
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,879
Charlotte, she just...

510
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,959
feels everything so strongly.

511
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,999
lf you truly knew her, you would see she's
terribly clever and wonderfully charitable

512
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,319
If she's earn such love and admiration
from one so kind and gentle as yourself,

513
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,679
l should never speak faultily of her.

514
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,159
Good night, Doctor.

515
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,999
Good night, Miss Dalrymple.

516
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,599
Don't, Frank.

517
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,679
How are you, this morning?

518
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,599
We doing fine.
He just misses his mother.

519
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,856
You know what...l was thinking about you this morning.

520
00:28:33,857 --> 00:28:35,374
Do you know what we going to start with?

521
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,799
Drawing.

522
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,679
Pardon me.

523
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,799
lt's quite alright, handsome.

524
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,119
Molly, is it?

525
00:28:59,857 --> 00:29:00,857
That's right, sir.

526
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,199
But my friends call me Molly the Lolly.

527
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,359
And l think that we can be friends.

528
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,199
Molly the Lolly.
That's an unusual nickname.

529
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,679
Fancy a lick?

530
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,759
No, no. Thank you.

531
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,519
Only six buck for the gentlemen like yourself.

532
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,279
lt will only take me a minute.

533
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,039
Well, lt's a generous offer, l'm sure.
But l have a very busy day ahead of me.

534
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,104
So, so, so...perhaps another time, okay?

535
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,371
No, no, no. What l mean to say is...

536
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,479
Will if you excuse me.

537
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,079
Suit yourself.

538
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,239
You alright, Fannie?

539
00:29:44,257 --> 00:29:45,257
Yeah...

540
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,999
lt's nothing.

541
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,359
Fannie, what is it? What?

542
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,399
lt's George.

543
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,039
Again.

544
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,359
l think he's gonna land us on the street.
This time

545
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,519
- Oh, no, no, miss. l can't
- No, take it. Take it.

546
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,559
Straight to the landlord.

547
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,399
No stopping.

548
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,359
l'll see you tonight.

549
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,639
Mrs. Bellamy, is it?

550
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,719
I'm Dr. Granville, Dr. Dalrymple new associate.
Good morning.

551
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,199
Very pleased to meet you, Doctor.

552
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,706
You've been here before?
- Yes.

553
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,879
So you are aware of the procedure?

554
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,839
lndeed.

555
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,658
Going well?

556
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,039
Yes, quite. Thank you.

557
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:35,820
As l said before, l'm leaving you
in very good hands, Mrs. Bellamy.

558
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,127
Oh..hahaha...

559
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:38,399
Thank you, doctor.

560
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:39,471
Good day.

561
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,359
Shall we begin?

562
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,079
Sorry about that.

563
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,799
- You alright, Doctor?
- Yes, quite. Thank you.

564
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,039
Here we go, then.

565
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,252
Please let me know if
anything is uncomfortable.

566
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,439
That's very nice, Doctor. Thank you.

567
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,719
Very nice, indeed.

568
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,439
Don't you understand? lt's an emergency.

569
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,759
The situation is desperate.

570
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,439
lt's completely impossible, madam.

571
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,759
l'll do anything.

572
00:32:40,353 --> 00:32:41,353
Mille grazie.

573
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,799
You are very welcome, Signora.

574
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,239
Next.

575
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,159
You knew they turning patients away.

576
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,839
Really? l hadn't notice.

577
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,199
l think because of you.

578
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,399
This may be broken.

579
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,519
Something wrong with your hand?

580
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,839
Just a twinge.

581
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,119
Allow me.

582
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,639
You seem to have settled in nicely, Dr. Granville.

583
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,159
Now, you may have noticed that l'm
not getting any younger.

584
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,919
And with only two daughters,

585
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,239
l have no one to carry on the practice.

586
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,199
l was wondering whether you might like to consider

587
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,279
becoming a partner.

588
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,079
Papa, that's a wonderful idea.

589
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,239
l...l'm speechless.

590
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,639
And who knows if things go well,
this practice may end up yours.

591
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,799
Since my dear wife Melodia, passed away...

592
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,678
God rest her soul.

593
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,919
Emily has diligently and professionally managed the household.

594
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,559
l've no doubt that one day
she would make a fine Doctor's wife,

595
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,199
with that experience.

596
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,959
Lovely.

597
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,879
l do hope l'm not expected
to stay here until after supper, everyday.

598
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,679
l'm very sorry, Ms. Smalley,
l'll be on schedule tomorrow. l promise.

599
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,879
l do hope so.

600
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,519
Right. Just in here.

601
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,639
We'll sit you down.

602
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,839
Miss Dalrymple, what a surprise?
l'm afraid that your father isn't here.

603
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,599
Good.

604
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,479
Well in that case l must tell you
that we work only to appointment.

605
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,479
Fannie has broken her ankle.
l was hoping to persuade you to treat it?

606
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,879
l'll have the fish n chips.

607
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,319
That's the rum talking.
lt's all l had to ease the pain.

608
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,039
Normally l don't recommend extreme drunkenness,
but it's probably a very good choice.

609
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,079
Let have a look at it.

610
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,079
l should tell you, we've no money.

611
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,039
Good night, Mrs. Smalley.

612
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,519
Oh..Good night.

613
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,786
Let's take her inside.
- Thank you.

614
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,279
l'm not wearing any knickers.

615
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,439
Well, l'm sure it's an honest mistake.

616
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,799
You want to look?

617
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,079
- What are these for?
- I'll explain later.

618
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,773
There we go.
- Lie back.

619
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,719
Very good.

620
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,000
Now, Fannie...
- Yes.

621
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,639
l want you to count to three for me.
Can you do that?

622
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,759
Yes, l think so.

623
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,279
One,

624
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,719
two...

625
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,079
Owww!!

626
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,559
You said three, bloody hell!

627
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,199
She's out, l think.

628
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,599
Forgive me. l wanted her thoughts elsewhere.

629
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,519
l need some plaster, for her ankle.

630
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,759
I didn't know my father had any
proper medical supplies in here anymore.

631
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,159
Crimean War's supplies l imagine.

632
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,039
Is your hand alright?

633
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,679
A bit stiff actually.

634
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,559
Why are you so opposed to your father?

635
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,479
My father...

636
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,639
You know he's never been
to the settlement house.

637
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,559
l simply wish he helped people
like Fannie who really need it

638
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,479
lnstead of the trivial work he does here.

639
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,799
lt's hardly trivial.

640
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,639
That one is a little bit sloppy, thank you nurse.

641
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,919
I apologize.

642
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,239
Hysteria is a disabling condition
suffered by half the women in this city.

643
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,719
Keeps you busy, l see.

644
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,159
Does wonders for disagreeable personalities.

645
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,599
You find me disagreeable?

646
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,559
l've only ever seen you shout at people and slam doors.

647
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,759
At least l've got the courage of my convictions.

648
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,639
And few friends, l would imagine?

649
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,319
Good.

650
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,279
Well, l'need to see you again

651
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,239
in six weeks, Fanny, to remove the cast.

652
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,479
Thank you, Doctor.

653
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,079
Yes, you've been a great help.

654
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,439
You're both very welcome.

655
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,759
lf you ever get bored, of nervous housewives

656
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,959
feel free to pay us a visit.

657
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,959
Hello, Mortimer.

658
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,039
Please, sit down.

659
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,100
Emily...

660
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,286
l've been...Oh, Emily...

661
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,559
l've been thinking...

662
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,879
should things progress
as your father suggested

663
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,959
and l one day l inherit the practice,

664
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,799
what would your feelings be, about...

665
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,199
well, an arrangement?

666
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,679
Mortimer...

667
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,409
l should be honoured.

668
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,719
Most especially as it will make father so happy.

669
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,599
Right...right.

670
00:38:53,726 --> 00:38:55,727
Umm...

671
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,959
Oh, that's settled.

672
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,302
Duty first, as always, Emily.

673
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,719
Life is of little value unless it be consecrated by duty.

674
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,159
Oh...Quite, yes.

675
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,719
Granville.

676
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,199
A word?

677
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,639
l must insist that you give Charlotte
no further assistance of any sort.

678
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,479
lt merely prolongs her relationship
with those people and that place.

679
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,199
The woman had a broken ankle.

680
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,679
l admire your dedication, Doctor.

681
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,679
But we can't have day labours
trade things through the office.

682
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,279
This is a very exclusive

683
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,296
and l might add, lucrative practice.
Appearances matter.

684
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,789
l have taken a solemn oath, Sir.

685
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,060
l thought we had an understanding, you and l...

686
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,212
about your future here.

687
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,239
That's last of it, Miss.

688
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,159
Oh, Jack. Thank you.

689
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,500
Well, then. lt's a two hundred late today

690
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,319
plus what's on account...

691
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,489
three carry to one...

692
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,919
seven and six, l think.

693
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,800
Yes...yes, that's right.
May l pay you Friday next?

694
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,879
l'm sorry, miss. But the gov is very clear.

695
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,208
Cash only, he said. And, get the balance.

696
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,759
Would you tell your employer,

697
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,599
that my father, Dr. Dalrymple,

698
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,279
has absolutely promised a very large donation
to the settlement house this coming Friday

699
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,119
and l'll will bring him the money myself.

700
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,959
l'll make it state, miss.

701
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,799
Nobody appreciates more
than me what you've done here.

702
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,439
My boy, Frank says you're the
strawberries and the cream.

703
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,297
Shush...Friday, then.
- Ta!

704
00:40:58,844 --> 00:41:00,844
Mortimer...must you wear that ghastly hand brace?

705
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,519
l must find some way to attend
to these women properly.

706
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,119
l believe the French have
quite a bit of luck using their tongues.

707
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,359
Please be serious.
We're speaking of my patients.

708
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,799
They need me.

709
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,359
Perhaps for the first time, l feel...

710
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,199
truly useful.

711
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,119
Aren't you a rainy day?

712
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,479
Oh, don't worry, something will come along, simply...
- Oww!!

713
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,359
l wish l could share your optimism.

714
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,439
Oh...Excuse me.

715
00:41:30,973 --> 00:41:31,973
Just...just...

716
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,831
Dr. Granville.
- Oh...

717
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,399
- Are you all right?
- Yes, l think so.

718
00:41:40,517 --> 00:41:41,517
Thank you.

719
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,180
Have you quite finished, Doctor?

720
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,919
Edmund, this is Emily's sister Charlotte.

721
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,359
Charlotte Dalrymple,

722
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,519
Edmund St. John Smythe.

723
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,400
Oh, Edmund Smythe from the papers.

724
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,919
Overblown...l assure you

725
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:02,955
l attended that party as a favour to a dear friend and l can swear l never met that horse before in my life.

726
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,239
Sounds as if you had a jolly good time.

727
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,359
What brings you to the west-end, Miss Dalrymple?

728
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,159
Begging for money, unsuccessfully till now.

729
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,199
Ah, yes. Miss Dalrymple runs a settlement house in the east end .

730
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,039
How fascinating.

731
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,959
l must be going.

732
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,399
Oh, that seems as your hand's no better.

733
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,679
lt must be difficult pleasuring
half the women in the city.

734
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,319
Madam, pleasure has nothing to do with it.
l can assure you

735
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,399
Well l suppose that depends on whether
your rave at the table or on it.

736
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,439
Goodbye.

737
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,759
You know how much we admire your spirit, Charlotte.

738
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,159
And we're lifelong friends of your father.

739
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,279
But these element you work with
are nothing more than

740
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,679
the draught horses of society.
l don't see how charity will help...

741
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,560
lt's not charity, perhaps a loan.

742
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,279
A loan? How much?

743
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,239
Two hundred pounds.

744
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,099
Generally, a loan has some security, dear.

745
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,999
They were my mother's.
They should cover the balance and more.

746
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,719
We will give you two hundred pounds at eight percent interest.
- Thank you.

747
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,679
Now l want you to be sure you
understand this is strictly business, Charlotte.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes

748
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,159
We won't hesitate to collect...

749
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,519
l understand.

750
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,919
Thank you.

751
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,319
Mr. Huddleston.

752
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,599
Thank you. Thank you for your time and your generous...

753
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,919
Mrs. Huddleston, thank you.

754
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,919
lt means a great deal to so many people.

755
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:29,350
Thank you, thank you.

756
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,319
Scandalous...

757
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:11,999
Hello?

758
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,199
Dr. Granville...

759
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,319
Trolling for patients?

760
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,039
Afraid you finding cases of hysteria here.

761
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,279
Women are all too busy trying to find enough to eat.

762
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,479
Miss Dalrymple. Always speaking out of turn.

763
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,412
No. l come to enquire about
Miss Fanny broken ankle.

764
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,919
A house call?

765
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,239
Surely, there's no harm following up with the patient?

766
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,799
None at all.

767
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,879
No pain?

768
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,039
No. Nothing.

769
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,279
l was going to take her to see you on Friday.

770
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,039
There's no bother.
l was in the neighbourhood.

771
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,801
l was...l was near the neighbourhood.

772
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,706
- How's that feel?
- Fine, thank you Doctor.

773
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,239
Would you like a cup of tea, Doctor?

774
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,079
Oh, no, thank you.

775
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,959
Dr. Granville. lt's the least we can offer.

776
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,959
Yes. Alright then.
Cup of tea would be lovely.

777
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,459
Take it easy on that for a few days.
- Yes, Doctor.

778
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,079
Very good. Now wait for me in a moment.
You can wait just through there.

779
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:52,358
Hello...

780
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,079
Hang on.

781
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,639
Just getting to the good bit.

782
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,279
Thank you. l wouldn't be able to sleep
without knowing how that turn out.

783
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,067
Milk, Doctor?
- Please.

784
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,599
We use this room mostly as a nursery.

785
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,879
l do fit in a little bit of teaching now and then.

786
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,599
Promoting some aggressive political agenda, no doubt.

787
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,959
Sums and letters mostly.

788
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,199
Occasionally we sneak in something slightly progressive.

789
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,519
Oh...you might like this.
Actually look. For example...

790
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,279
this is where the children wash their hand.

791
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,479
We use soap

792
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,759
and boiled water. We do our best
to keep the settlement sanitary, but...

793
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,759
you can't imagine the filth and the germs.

794
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,159
You know about germs?

795
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,319
l do read, Doctor.

796
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,559
l spend years trying to convinced the medical
establishment that the hand washing prevent disease

797
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,039
and unsuccessfully.

798
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,679
and then here you are teaching it to the children.

799
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,959
And with great success.

800
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,879
l know. With the parents is another story.
But, eventually the children will teach them themselves.

801
00:46:54,222 --> 00:46:55,222
Bravo.

802
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,559
For the women, we're trying to provide
services that will offer the most direct result.

803
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,719
Good hot meal, safe place for
their children and communal laundry.

804
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,039
l think that if we can ease their work load a bit We could get on to the important

805
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,439
work, of changing their minds.

806
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,959
You Madam, are a socialist.

807
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,319
A socialist?

808
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,439
What if l am?

809
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,559
Socialism, it isn't hard.

810
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,679
lt's nothing more than a group pulling together.

811
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,759
lf women pull together,
if they weren't so frightened,

812
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,599
There's no telling what we could accomplish.

813
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,999
ln this revolution that you're planning,
will you achieved it all from here?

814
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,839
Drop a stone in a pond, then it will main rippled.

815
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,439
lt's a bit like pond. lt is true. l know this.
- Yes.

816
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,239
The building adjacent,

817
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,385
and the one behind,
are both for sale for two thousand pounds.

818
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,100
Bought them together,
and we're not just a classroom and a kitchen

819
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,999
we're centre for the neighbourhood with a garden,

820
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,999
a proper school,
maybe even a medical clinic.

821
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,679
And two thousand pounds,
is aiming quite high, don't you think?

822
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,039
No, I don't think so.

823
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,879
l know, by the time l'm gone,
women will have the vote

824
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,159
they have equal education
and rights over their own bodies.

825
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,359
and l'd like to play some small
part in making that happen.

826
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,257
Absolutely. And then,
you should teach them how to fly.

827
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,399
l would.

828
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,679
You just wait and see, Doctor.

829
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,479
l'd like to see your face.

830
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,559
Your passion, your devotion to this work is admirable.

831
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,159
Honestly,

832
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,719
l get much more out of it than they do.

833
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,519
They only get food and laundry
and l'm giving a useful life.

834
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,079
And l set my own hours.

835
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,479
You know...

836
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,079
l could really use the help of
an able Doctor on a more regular basis.

837
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,519
bread and apple for the least of it

838
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,879
All the children suffer from malnutrition, scurvy,

839
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,879
even cholera and typhus.

840
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,599
All preventable as you know

841
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,639
with the knowledge and resources.

842
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,279
l'm afraid my patients keep me very busy.

843
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,639
l only mean...
l only mean a weekend a month.

844
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,759
l don't believe l would have the time.

845
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,800
Or even a few hours on a Sunday. Anything would help.

846
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:07,879
I'm sorry.

847
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,685
Please. Please.
- Miss Dalrymple.

848
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,679
l'm afraid l can't help.

849
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,119
You can't...

850
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,399
or you won't?

851
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,119
lt's a bit more complex than that.

852
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,679
l know, l know. lt's...

853
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,319
lt's my father.
He wouldn't allow it, would he?

854
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,319
ls that why you came here?

855
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,319
To keep me from bringing Fannie
back to his posh little practice?

856
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,519
Thank you for the tea.

857
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,359
Run along Doctor. Back to your...

858
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,799
silly comfortable life.

859
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,639
Mrs. Castellari, Doctor.

860
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,661
Send her in, Nurse.
- Mrs. Castellari.

861
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,239
Mrs. Castellari, how are you?

862
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,719
Sad, Doctore.

863
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,519
Very sad today.

864
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,679
Good, good.
Lie back, please.

865
00:50:26,471 --> 00:50:27,471
Aii!!!

866
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,614
Your hand is so cold, Doctore.

867
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,319
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Castellari.
I forgot.

868
00:50:38,749 --> 00:50:39,749
Yes.

869
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,519
ls  that better?

870
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,439
I think that's enough for today, Doctore.

871
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,359
Feeling better, than?

872
00:51:10,783 --> 00:51:11,783
Mrs. Castellari!

873
00:51:12,649 --> 00:51:13,649
Mrs. Castellari!

874
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,309
I assure you Mrs. Castellari,
this has never happened to me before.

875
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,159
You have discredited my entire practice.

876
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,199
l'm very sorry.

877
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,599
Sorry will hardly suffice.

878
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,119
Your disability is clearly far more serious
than you let me to believe.

879
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:36,079
Ms. Castellari tells me you fail
to complete the treatment.

880
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,799
And now,

881
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,799
l discovered that Mrs. Parsons has stopped coming altogether.

882
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,439
lf you could only see or wait while giving
me one more chance, l can assure you...

883
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,599
No.

884
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,839
l thought you were someone l could trust,

885
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,039
with my business, my family,

886
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,159
my reputation.

887
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,134
But, clearly l was mistaken.

888
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,679
You're dismissed.

889
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,879
Doctor.
- Dismissed!

890
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,359
l'm terribly sorry.

891
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,319
l'm finished, Edmund.

892
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,399
Completely buggered.

893
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,319
l had a perfect life within reach and, l lost it.

894
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,159
All due to hand cramps.

895
00:53:02,495 --> 00:53:04,447
[phone rings]

896
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:05,599
God!

897
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,039
Someone's telephoned.

898
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,999
Ahoy!

899
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,919
I didn't know you had a telephone.

900
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,679
l'm very, very flattered. Yeah.

901
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,959
Oh, yes, indeed.

902
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,199
My God!

903
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,239
Now l'm inventing a cleaning tool.

904
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,919
Yeah, very good.

905
00:53:42,138 --> 00:53:43,138
Yes.

906
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,359
Yeah, do that...

907
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,622
Got to rush, actually now.
Goodbye.

908
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,559
Oh...Don't stop.

909
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,159
l think you're enjoying yourself too much.

910
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,519
lt makes your hand feel all...all warm and tingling.

911
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,999
l feel it right down to the bone.

912
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,039
Oh, really?

913
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,759
Turn it back on.

914
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:10,959
Please...

915
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,559
Well, that's what l call good steady pressure.

916
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,759
Does it go any higher?

917
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:35,919
Go on.

918
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,479
That's it. That's the spot.

919
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:48,999
My feathers!

920
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,839
This is the spot, indeed.

921
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,839
Bugger...

922
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,519
You smell burning?

923
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,319
But you said yourself that you
could feel the vibration deep inside...

924
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,959
l know what l said.

925
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,719
But this is crude and rough and inexact

926
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,919
and nothing at all like
the motion and pressure that l use.

927
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,839
Didn't seem to have much this time.

928
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,439
l grant you.

929
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,959
lf this works,

930
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,359
it could put you back in good standing with Dr. Dalrymple and Emily.

931
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,479
Edmund, let me be perfectly clear about this.

932
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,759
We are not going to take

933
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,599
a dangerous explosive and untried electrical device

934
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,839
and press it against the ladies most gentle areas.

935
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,919
That's it, then.

936
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,639
l believe l shall regret this
to the very end of my days.

937
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,879
Now, who should we try it on?

938
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,919
Ordinarily for five pounds, l
wouldn't ask questions.

939
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,679
That's with the men. This is a different kettle of fish.

940
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,079
I don't believe it will involve any pain.
But if it does,

941
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,359
we will stop immediately.

942
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,519
Think of it this way, Molly.

943
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,239
for one brief moment, you could be a
pioneer of technology.

944
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,639
A voyage of the British Empire,

945
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,982
and quite possibly, the
vanguard of modern medical science.

946
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,479
And we pay up front.

947
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,319
Why not?

948
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,679
Do your worst.

949
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,248
Ooh...
- Are you hurt?

950
00:56:49,249 --> 00:56:50,249
No.

951
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,919
No. lt just scared me. That's all.

952
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,279
I've never felt one like that before.

953
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,759
Shall l stop?

954
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,359
No, no. Try again.
l'll be ready this time.

955
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,919
Oh, right there.

956
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,279
Yes, like that.

957
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,599
How do you feel, Molly?

958
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,639
Bloody marvellous, what do you think?

959
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,628
Would you say you had a paroxysm?

960
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,039
l'd say three from conunting.

961
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,959
lt got a little muddled in the middle.

962
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,719
lt's astonishing.

963
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,479
What you call that little thing?

964
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,519
Well, l was calling it a feather duster.

965
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,359
Well, let's think of something quick.

966
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,319
So the girls know what to ask for.

967
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,919
Whore's feathers?

968
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,279
l give you my word as a gentleman, sir.

969
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,519
Three paroxysms in five minutes.

970
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,319
No harm came to the girl?

971
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,079
She was completely satisfied with the result.

972
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,879
Yes. Well, l can hardly take the word of a trollop.

973
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,919
That's why we must try it here.

974
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,679
Medical science demands a thorough investigation.

975
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:42,079
What better place to start than with these women
whom we know suffer so from hysteria?

976
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,359
Yes. Well, in my opinion, change is rarely beneficial.

977
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,639
l believe we're on the verge
of something revolutionary, sir.

978
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,079
lf we achieve half as much of your patients,

979
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,959
all credit goes to you.

980
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,679
Not just money, fame.

981
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,039
Three paroxysms in five minutes, you say?

982
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,279
Very well .
One test case.

983
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:10,119
But if she comes to harm, on your head be it.

984
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,399
The rubby-nubby.

985
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,119
The vibratorium.

986
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,799
Jigly-wigly?

987
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,999
paroxysmator.

988
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,839
Oh, the sorcerer's apprentice.

989
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,119
- Excitetator?
- Mr. Wobleck.

990
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,919
What about, the squealer?

991
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,759
You gonna need a bigger appointment book.

992
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,519
Electric massage?

993
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,119
l don't know.

994
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,999
l have full confidence that the
machine will equal if not better,

995
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,719
any treatment you've had before.

996
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,039
And, since you're so unsatisfied last time,

997
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,359
l'm prepared to offer you this, gratis.

998
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,919
l'll trust you, Doctore.

999
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,519
This is Mr. Edmund St...

1000
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,399
That is my electrical assistant.

1001
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,399
He'll be attending as well, if that's alright?

1002
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,559
lt's a little surprising at first, Mrs. Castellari.
But don't be alarmed,

1003
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,439
you'll soon get used to it.

1004
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,679
Everything all right, Mrs. Castellari?

1005
01:01:52,851 --> 01:01:53,851
Bravo!

1006
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,399
Well done.

1007
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,239
So, don't forget to chain the gate,

1008
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,159
And, oh...l left the candle lit in the kitchen.

1009
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,039
Go, and have a lovely evening.

1010
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,919
You know, l think l will.

1011
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,359
Bye.

1012
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,119
Dr. Mortimer Granville.

1013
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,039
Oh, l'm sorry. We're closing.

1014
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,159
- Get her out of there.

1015
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,759
Two hundred pounds plus interest,
or we lock the gate.

1016
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,119
But l don't have it.

1017
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,639
Right. l'm locking the gate.

1018
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,359
Get of me!

1019
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:18,625
No doubt, you're the luckiest man in all of London.
- Miss Dalrymple.

1020
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,159
Miss Charlotte Dalrymple.

1021
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,319
Will you excuse me, ladies?

1022
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,119
Miss Dalrymple.

1023
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,359
Dr. Granville, good evening.

1024
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:45,119
Congratulations.
l'm sure you'll make my sister very happy.

1025
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,199
Something wrong?

1026
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,359
No, no.

1027
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,999
l just never seen you so...

1028
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:53,999
Formally attired?

1029
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,319
l was going to say...

1030
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:57,839
clean.

1031
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,559
Dr. Granville, l can assure you

1032
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,644
that women enjoy physical pleasure just
as much as men,

1033
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:12,319
even if it can be harsh to come by.
- Physical pleasure has nothing to do with it.

1034
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,159
lt is strictly a medical treatment that stimulates the nervous system.

1035
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:18,319
lndeed it does, doesn't it.
Bargain it to guinea.

1036
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,879
But my point is,

1037
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:23,279
according to your diagnosis,
hysteria seems to cover everything,

1038
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,439
from insomnia to toothache.

1039
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,420
lt's not my...
- lt's nothing more than a catch-all

1040
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:28,420
for dissatisfied women.

1041
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,839
women, forced to spend
their lives on domestic chores

1042
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,639
and their prudish and
selfish husbands who are unwilling

1043
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,679
or unable to make love to them properly, or often enough.

1044
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,359
You seem to have strong opinions
on husbands for a woman who doesn't have one.

1045
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,399
Look, if you don't believe me,

1046
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,319
ask your patients.

1047
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,879
Faintly ironic, don't you think.
Use my engagement party

1048
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,719
as an opportunity to deliver your opinion matters?
- Yes, yes.

1049
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:55,359
and l apologize for that, but you must admit,
you men really did get the best side to the bargain.

1050
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,199
Bargain?

1051
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,639
For l said, lt's mindless housework and dating some halfwit

1052
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,542
you can make some halfwit very happy.

1053
01:05:00,542 --> 01:05:02,959
lt simply not enough for me, or for most women.

1054
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,279
Would it be enough for you?

1055
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:07,119
l'm not most women.
Wouldn't you be lonely?

1056
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,279
l will take a partner.
An equal.

1057
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:16,039
But, not for me a life of darning socks, doing chores

1058
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,759
until my mental faculties become Sunday pudding.

1059
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,159
Does someone say Sunday pudding?

1060
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:22,839
Lord and Lady St. John Smythe may l present

1061
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:23,839
Miss Dalrymple.

1062
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,899
Miss Dalrymple, my guardians.
Lord and Lady St. John Smythe.

1063
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,719
Charlotte  "Sunday pudding" Dalrymple.

1064
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,880
So please to meet you, my dear.

1065
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,319
l love a good Sunday pudding.

1066
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,319
Cannot be happier for you, Mortimer.

1067
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,280
You make us proud, each and every day.

1068
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:36,999
Thank you.

1069
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,319
Lovely earrings.

1070
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,520
Oh, thank you. They were my mother's.

1071
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,558
Will your mother be joining us this evening?

1072
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:45,239
No, my mother is in fact dead,
my Lord.

1073
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,858
l trust we didn't waste an invitation on her.

1074
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,600
What about your father?

1075
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,800
Will he be here or is he dead as well?

1076
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,679
No. My father is quite well. Thank you.

1077
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,582
l've not seen him but l'm sure he'll be here soon.

1078
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,279
Oh, hurry up. Damn you.

1079
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,399
Give a move on!

1080
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,759
They only keep the love of your life waiting, my dear.

1081
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,119
A toast to the happy couple.

1082
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,840
You'll soon find that the key to a happy marriage

1083
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:25,480
is the ability to enjoy a good argument.
- Yes.

1084
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,608
Do remember to let him win once in a while, my dear.

1085
01:06:27,892 --> 01:06:29,599
Oh...Oh...no, no.

1086
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,239
There's a misunderstanding.

1087
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,373
l'd rather marry Edmund than Dr. Granville.

1088
01:06:33,373 --> 01:06:34,639
Marry Edmund?

1089
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,519
Sure, she's a live one.

1090
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,360
Who is this man?

1091
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,359
That's my father.

1092
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:51,740
l thought he was dead.

1093
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,879
May l present, Dr. Robert Dalrymple.

1094
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:54,679
My Lord.

1095
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:58,025
And this is my fiance, Emily Dalrymple.

1096
01:06:58,025 --> 01:06:59,199
Fiance? But l thought...

1097
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,126
Never mind, dear.

1098
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,399
How very nice to meet you, Doctor.
- My Lady

1099
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:03,998
Miss Dalrymple.

1100
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,319
l do apologize for being so late.

1101
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,239
That's quite alright.

1102
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,244
Your hair is the most adventurous, Emily.

1103
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,159
Oh, do you think so?

1104
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,279
It took it so long to get it up there.

1105
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,639
Shall we do the once around.

1106
01:07:19,351 --> 01:07:21,351
Well, yes.
- Excuse us.

1107
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,399
Port, Doctor?

1108
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,199
Delightful.

1109
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:32,359
Tell me how you met our young
Mortimer?

1110
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,869
Lovely party.

1111
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:42,999
Yes...yes, it is.

1112
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,199
What are your interests?

1113
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,719
Music, l enjoy reading.

1114
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,759
Phrenology.

1115
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,239
Mortimer stay modest.

1116
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,479
Tell us how widen your accomplished, you are.

1117
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:02,679
Phrenology is a treasure map to
the personality if one is properly trained.

1118
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,919
We are licensing this machine
to doctors all over London.

1119
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,439
For a very generous royalty, of course.

1120
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,159
l despise business.

1121
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,325
So do l.

1122
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,672
Oh, Mr. And Mrs. Huddleston. Come, let me introduce you.

1123
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,599
Good evening, Mr. Huddleston.

1124
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,999
Mrs. Huddleston, do you know Dr. Granville?

1125
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,118
Not personally.

1126
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,040
Very nice to meet you.
- Charmed.

1127
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,359
Looks though You going to be getting
these earrings after all.

1128
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,719
You'll have to excuse us.

1129
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:35,959
l'm sorry.

1130
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,239
That was a little odd.

1131
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:41,319
These earrings are the security against the loan for the settlement house for this due tomorrow.

1132
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,199
So this is my last night with them.

1133
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,199
They were your mother's.

1134
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,159
Yes, they were.

1135
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,759
You do what you must.

1136
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,559
l'm sure she would have approved.

1137
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,039
Bugger.

1138
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,545
Throughout history,

1139
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:34,663
great English families
have gathered in halls such as this,

1140
01:09:34,663 --> 01:09:36,639
to celebrate the impending nuptial...

1141
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,079
Lord, save us.

1142
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,079
Tell me. What happened?

1143
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,799
They came for the money,
I told them that l didn't have it...

1144
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:51,280
Mr. Huddleston, what's the meaning of this?
you gave us until Monday.

1145
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:54,679
l no longer hold the note, Charlotte.
Your father does.

1146
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:55,720
Father?

1147
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:57,359
Charlotte, calm down.

1148
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,159
l'm simply doing what's best for you.

1149
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:00,359
What are you doing?

1150
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:04,199
l purchased the note from Mr. Huddleston,

1151
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,319
and l'm closing down the settlement house.
You no longer have any debt...

1152
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,168
These are the actions of a villain.

1153
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,599
Charlotte.
- Of a villain

1154
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,480
This is your sister's engagement party.

1155
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:17,679
Party? She's bruised and bleeding.
You want me to consider a party?

1156
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,159
Make way, please.

1157
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,239
Leave her.
- This is a private party.

1158
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,879
You're not manhandling her.

1159
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:25,919
Let me handle this.

1160
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:26,919
We've got this under control.

1161
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,079
l'm a doctor. l believe
this woman needs medical attention.

1162
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,399
l don't know that, sir, but l do know she's not staying.

1163
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:32,519
l haven't done anything wrong.

1164
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:33,799
Please stop. She's hurt.

1165
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:34,999
Just please, Charlotte.

1166
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,479
lf we can discuss this like civilized men.

1167
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,759
Let me by.

1168
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,579
l said let me by.

1169
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,679
Damn.
Did l miss something?

1170
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,119
l would never have imagine it will come to this.

1171
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,439
But we'll have to help her.

1172
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,519
There's nothing 'but', Emily.

1173
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,719
l tried indulging her, l tried a firm hand

1174
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:37,680
l've met my worst end.

1175
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:38,479
Mortimer.

1176
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,839
Please, she's my sister.

1177
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,407
What would you have me do?

1178
01:11:42,407 --> 01:11:44,704
You must testify on her behalf.

1179
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,759
- And say what?
- The truth.

1180
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,319
That she's hysterical.

1181
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,959
Sir, they will send her to a sanatorium.

1182
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,159
That's the only thing that will keep her out of prison.

1183
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:13,800
Order!
Order!

1184
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,039
This court will come to order.

1185
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,959
The facts are these, Your Honour.

1186
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:58,599
One fortnight ago,
the defendant, Charlotte Dalrymple,

1187
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,425
in full view of witnesses,

1188
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:04,479
assaulted a police Constable caring out his duty.

1189
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,255
If this were a first offense,

1190
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:10,439
then a short prison sentence might suffice, but...

1191
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,681
this isn't the first offence, is it Miss Dalrymple?

1192
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,959
You're arrested last April

1193
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,679
on public nuisance

1194
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,134
and resisting arrest.

1195
01:13:19,134 --> 01:13:22,879
Your honour, l was handing out
suffragette leaflets in Trafalgar Square

1196
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,639
when two officers arrested me.

1197
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,679
The officers sworn statements read:

1198
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,559
"Miss Dalrymple was asked
to leave the square,

1199
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:33,239
where upon she started

1200
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,959
to shout and jump about".

1201
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,159
"When finally we did try to place her in handcuffs,

1202
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:41,679
she resisted

1203
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,479
most violently".

1204
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:44,879
No. That is not true.

1205
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,359
You will speak only when questionrd, Miss Dalrymple.

1206
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,679
Well, how am l to defend myself against
his accusation if you won't let me speak?

1207
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,279
ls there more?

1208
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:53,799
l'm afraid there is, Your Honour.

1209
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,719
October 1879, solicitation.

1210
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,399
No, that was not me.

1211
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,519
My friend, Molly...

1212
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:04,511
she is a prostitute. She was a prostitute.

1213
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,119
She has since found gainful employment,

1214
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,239
as a maid, in my father's house.

1215
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,359
Anything else, Mr. Squyers?

1216
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,319
No, Your honour.

1217
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:18,159
No? Nothing else?
What's of the crime

1218
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,079
of charity and compassion?

1219
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,159
Very admirable l'm sure.

1220
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:25,919
Seems that the help included prostitution,
resisting arrest and

1221
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:27,839
assaulting police officers.

1222
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:32,719
One could only imagine that the cost to England,
should be sending university education to all her women .

1223
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,200
Yes, it's very easy, isn't it?

1224
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,239
to make fun of women's lives.

1225
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,079
I would like to see you,

1226
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,639
walk for one mile in our shoes,

1227
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,880
l imagine that your mirth would turn, first

1228
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,219
to sympathy and then to despair.

1229
01:14:48,219 --> 01:14:50,519
Be careful, Miss Dalrymple.
Your symptoms are showing.

1230
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,639
Until England fully recognizes

1231
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,159
the worth and contributions of women,

1232
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,919
will she'll be anything other than a second class country

1233
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,279
despite all her wealth.

1234
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,679
That's enough, Miss Dalrymple.

1235
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,760
Your Honour,
Charlotte Dalrymple clearly suffers from

1236
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,799
erratic, aggressive and violent emotions.

1237
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,239
That are best described, as incurable hysteria.

1238
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,279
To back truce my opinion, l would like to call

1239
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,199
an expert witness, Your Honour.

1240
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,039
Proceed, Mr. Squyers.

1241
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,878
l would like to call Dr. Mortimer Granville,

1242
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,359
lf it pleases the court.

1243
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,359
Mortimer Granville, please.

1244
01:15:42,259 --> 01:15:44,259
Dr. Mortimer Granville.

1245
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,319
Your Honour.

1246
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,120
The evidence you shall give shall be the truth,

1247
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,960
the whole truth nothing but
the truth so help you God!

1248
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:02,719
lt will.

1249
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,479
State your name.

1250
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:06,839
Mortimer Granville.

1251
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,911
Now, l'm sure we all, are well aware
of your celebrity, Doctor.

1252
01:16:12,911 --> 01:16:16,788
But, if you wouldn't mind just telling us
a little of your professional experience.

1253
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:22,439
l'm a medical doctor whose practice consists
of treating women diagnosed with hysteria.

1254
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:25,919
And in this capacity,
how many women have you treated?

1255
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:26,719
Hundreds, certainly.

1256
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,239
And always good results, l trust?

1257
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,119
we've had few complaints of late.

1258
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,399
ls it true Dr. Granville that,

1259
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,599
incurable cases of hysteria

1260
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,157
demand institutionalization and surgical hysterectomy?

1261
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:45,669
Please answer the question, Dr. Granville.

1262
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:47,599
Well, yes.

1263
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:49,879
Traditionally, yes.

1264
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,840
But only in the most severe,
most persistence cases...

1265
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,279
Thank you, doctor.

1266
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,239
We have already address the...

1267
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:00,011
the persistence of Miss Dalrymple problem.

1268
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:05,639
ln your professional opinion, Doctor,
as an expert in the field of hysteria,

1269
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,999
how would you describe Miss Dalrymple behaviour?

1270
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:11,839
Without a doubt,

1271
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,679
Charlotte Dalrymple is...

1272
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,159
erratic,

1273
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,559
and volatile,

1274
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,319
and at times physically aggressive.

1275
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,639
She is also the most vexing woman l've ever met.

1276
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,079
Thank you, doctor.

1277
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,400
Your Honour, based on this evidence,

1278
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,679
l find that, l must recommend

1279
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:40,119
that Charlotte Dalrymple be remanded to the
chumps for the institute for the criminally insane.

1280
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,799
With a further recommendation

1281
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,189
for immediate surgical hysterectomy.

1282
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:49,639
l wasn't quite finished.

1283
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:56,647
Miss Dalrymple
is also the most generous, compassionate,

1284
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:00,039
selfless and truly Christian

1285
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,039
woman that l have ever met.

1286
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,759
Doctor, you just sworn that she is erratic,

1287
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:06,959
volatile,

1288
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,359
and even physically aggressive.

1289
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,319
Would you not characterize that as hysterical?

1290
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,679
Well, you see...

1291
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,639
after consulting with my patients

1292
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,319
and considerable reflection,

1293
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,159
lt is my professional opinion

1294
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,091
that hysteria is a fiction.

1295
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,639
lt's nothing but a...

1296
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:34,359
a catch-all diagnosis for women without opportunity

1297
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:37,719
forced to spend their life tending to domestic chores

1298
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,959
and selfish, prudish husband who are

1299
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,279
unwilling or unable

1300
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,879
to make love to them properly.

1301
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:48,519
Or often enough.

1302
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:53,399
l beg your pardon, Doctor...

1303
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:54,399
Your Honour,

1304
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,199
the Constable suffered no grave injury.

1305
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:00,840
but great harm must still be done if
Miss Dalrymple is locked away and butchered.

1306
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:04,159
England will lose a devoted and singular woman

1307
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,963
she can ill afford to spare.

1308
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,040
I grant you, there may not be room in the world

1309
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:12,239
for more than one
Charlotte Dalrymple.

1310
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,879
Fortunately for all of us,

1311
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,319
l think they must've broken the mould.

1312
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,719
ln the case of Charlotte Dalrymple,

1313
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:43,538
there are no easy answers.

1314
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,837
Mr. Squyers,

1315
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,839
l find your case for hysteria

1316
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:49,559
wanting.

1317
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:56,039
By your reasoning,
we should lock up every female in

1318
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:59,120
whom whimsy and logic collide which

1319
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,439
suggests me most of the women in England.

1320
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,327
My wife included.

1321
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,119
On behalf of that matter, however

1322
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,879
l am loath to offer precedent
where

1323
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,199
a policeman safety is being served.

1324
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:13,879
Miss Dalrymple,

1325
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:17,319
for striking a police officer in the course of his duty,

1326
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:20,227
l sentenced you to

1327
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,997
thirty days in prison.

1328
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:25,239
and l want you

1329
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,119
to think most carefully and act most cautiously in the future.

1330
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:32,679
Take her.

1331
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,519
Miss Dalrymple.

1332
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,239
Dr. Granville.

1333
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,718
suppose l know that you might be interestrd.

1334
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:47,119
That's an interesting offer,
something to meditate on while l consider a new career.

1335
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,839
Mortimer Granville, you're a good doctor, and you should remain one

1336
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:54,200
lnstead of leaching and bleeding
people in cutting them up to no purpose

1337
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:57,519
you, have invented a machine that does harm to no one

1338
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:00,399
and makes anyone had comes into contact with to feel better.

1339
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:05,679
l should think there a very few doctors in history
that could have a glimpse of such accomplishment.

1340
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,239
You are a confounding woman.

1341
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,839
You're all fier and brimstone in one minute,
compliments and common sense the next.

1342
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,772
I am a woman like any other.

1343
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,408
No, no. You're quite unlike any women l've ever met.

1344
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:20,423
Will you be alright?

1345
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:23,165
l'm fine. l've got lots of friends in prison.

1346
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:33,388
Mortimer

1347
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,639
Thought l might find you here.

1348
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:46,439
l've been thinking a lot about my future.

1349
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:49,120
And...well, actually

1350
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,279
l was wondering if you might give me a reading.

1351
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,279
l'm sorry. l've giving up phrenology.

1352
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:56,879
Oh, Emily, l'm...

1353
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,479
l'm so sorry.

1354
01:21:58,720 --> 01:21:59,759
Don't be.

1355
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:04,520
Charlotte's trial was a revelation for me as well.

1356
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:07,938
l realized... l haven't been living my life at all.

1357
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,720
l've been living my father's idea what my life should be

1358
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:12,639
Phrenology, Chopin.

1359
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,439
Even you, Mortimer.

1360
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,479
You seem happy.

1361
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:20,879
l am.

1362
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,640
After all, life will always
be to large extent to what we ourselves make it.

1363
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:29,679
The inimitable Mr. Smiles.
l shall miss him.

1364
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,498
And l shall miss you.

1365
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:41,959
God, you're naughty

1366
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,519
l should never send yourself of it .

1367
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,607
No, no. Not even for Christmas.

1368
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,399
You just go out and purchase one for yourself.

1369
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,759
God bless you, Mom.

1370
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:55,559
lt is a clever old woman
who can keep up with today's technology.

1371
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:56,680
Alright then.

1372
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,120
Lovely chatting to you.

1373
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,239
Ring me anytime.
Goodbye.

1374
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,840
Any prospects?

1375
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:09,000
My name is mud.

1376
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,479
Open this.

1377
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,440
l told you before l don't want your money.

1378
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,399
lt's not my money, it's yours.

1379
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:23,799
lt's your share of the royalties

1380
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:25,799
of my manufacturers.

1381
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:30,519
The portable electric massager.

1382
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,880
The portable electric massager?

1383
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,959
Yes, l told you l was working on something rather exciting .

1384
01:23:35,959 --> 01:23:38,720
You see, l made a very small motor.

1385
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:41,560
lt seems to go really well, so l shared it to few firms,

1386
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,479
and they simply adored it.

1387
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:44,519
And apparently,

1388
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,679
They're selling it directly to women for home use.

1389
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,519
l really have to admit, l know for it go so high

1390
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:55,479
but, it is rather ingenious that l signifies saying it

1391
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:56,839
myself.

1392
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,815
Don't you understand, Mortimer?
You have your fortune now.

1393
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,719
You can have anything you want.

1394
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:54,399
Miss Dalrymple.

1395
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:58,999
Dr. Granville.

1396
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:01,039
Hello.

1397
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,079
Merry Christmas.

1398
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:14,839
I realize it's a day early but l thought you might need it.

1399
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,639
I don't know what to say.

1400
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,239
Apparently, there is a first time for everything.

1401
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:21,719
Right.

1402
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:34,559
May I?

1403
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:40,479
That's lovely.

1404
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:45,239
Oh, that's very kind.

1405
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,679
Oh, there's something more.

1406
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,839
Think of it as a getting out of prison present.

1407
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,920
You once said that with two thousand pounds,
you can change the world.

1408
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,240
You're not serious?

1409
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:07,679
Apparently, l'm rich.

1410
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,959
And the buildings are yet for sale.

1411
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,039
Well, l'm not too late, am l? You're still interested?

1412
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,599
Yes, of course.
More than ever.

1413
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:24,279
Although l should think by the time l finished,
few thousand pounds not be nearly enough...

1414
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,520
Are you never satisfied, woman?

1415
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:27,959
might be enough for a clinic.

1416
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:29,759
Clinic?

1417
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,559
Would it pay well?

1418
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:35,719
l'm afraid not.

1419
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,519
Would the cases be interesting?

1420
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,039
Routine, l should think.

1421
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,639
Broken bones,

1422
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,119
sick children,

1423
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:43,879
needy women.

1424
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:45,239
Sounds revolting.

1425
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,109
Perhaps something else.

1426
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:50,119
Perhaps something there.

1427
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,640
l wondered if you might have an opening

1428
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:02,839
for a partner, for an equal?

1429
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:04,999
Mortimer, if you think...

1430
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:05,959
Oh damn it!

1431
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,639
Charlotte Dalrymple,

1432
01:27:09,478 --> 01:27:10,630
l love you.

1433
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,900
Will you marry me?

1434
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:24,079
Please don't make me beg. Not in the street.

1435
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,319
I need to kiss you first.

1436
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,719
Charlotte, l hardly think that in the circumstance...

1437
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,759
- Did you like it?
- Yes, it was rather nice actually.

1438
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:43,706
You so?

1439
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,839
Not bad.
You'll get better.

1440
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,519
Who would've thought?

1441
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,399
Charlotte and Mortimer, together.

1442
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,119
Life often brings together strange bedfellows.

1443
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,945
Yes, quite...quite.

1444
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,679
Well, all's well that ends well.

1445
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,159
Fresh air and perambulation.

1446
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:25,319
The key to mental equity and long life.

1447
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,279
lf you say so, Doctor.

1448
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,759
Oh, look. Ducks.

1449
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:19,240
You alright down there, Colonel?

1450
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:22,080
Patience, Eugenia. Patience.

1451
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:25,239
The empire was not built in a day.

1452
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:37,817
That's very casual of you.

1453
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:41,599
What are you wearing?
