1
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,499
Let us finish it.

2
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:23,401
- Perhaps it is a trap.
- It is.

3
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:25,700
Then what do we do?

4
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:28,802
We break through.

5
00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:27,405
There!

6
00:03:27,505 --> 00:03:29,704
I see him.

7
00:03:44,805 --> 00:03:46,606
Pagans!

8
00:03:57,306 --> 00:03:59,707
- Forward still.
- Retreat!

9
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:02,606
No! Do not stop.

10
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:27,808
We are her salvation, and through
her command we shall live forever.

11
00:04:27,908 --> 00:04:30,808
I will not die.
Not here, not now!

12
00:04:30,808 --> 00:04:33,508
Never!

13
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,417
No!

14
00:07:13,117 --> 00:07:15,318
We're almost there.

15
00:07:57,221 --> 00:08:01,021
You'll make it.
I won't let you die.

16
00:08:27,922 --> 00:08:30,122
You're strong enough.

17
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:33,122
Finish it.

18
00:08:46,622 --> 00:08:50,423
Don't worry.
We'll be all right.

19
00:08:50,723 --> 00:08:53,523
I just need to take a little.

20
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:40,026
Finish it.

21
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:53,526
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Take a walk with me.

22
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,527
- I have to work.
- It's the first snow...

23
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,927
Yeah, I know, but they're waiting on me.

24
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:01,827
- Come on, Tommy.
- Please, Izzi.

25
00:10:05,527 --> 00:10:07,428
I'm sorry.

26
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:09,528
I am.

27
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:15,527
I'll see you tonight.

28
00:12:52,937 --> 00:12:55,238
Finish it.

29
00:12:57,537 --> 00:12:59,938
Please, leave me alone.

30
00:13:00,938 --> 00:13:03,938
I don't know how it ends.

31
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,139
All right.

32
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,740
I trust you.

33
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,839
Take me.

34
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:46,440
Show me.

35
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,341
- What are you doing here?
- Take a walk with me.

36
00:13:56,441 --> 00:13:58,441
- I have to work.
- It's the first snow...

37
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:01,341
Yeah, I know, but they're waiting on me.

38
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,541
- Come on, Tommy.
- Please, Izzi.

39
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:07,541
I'm sorry.

40
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:09,942
I am.

41
00:14:10,941 --> 00:14:13,442
I'll see you tonight, OK?

42
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:19,542
Izzi.

43
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:23,342
Hey! Dr. Creo.
Antonio's on his way back.

44
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:27,442
Donovan's open and ready.
His vitals are steady.

45
00:14:30,142 --> 00:14:31,343
Dammit.

46
00:14:31,343 --> 00:14:34,143
Come on.

47
00:14:34,143 --> 00:14:40,043
- Did he say if it was working?
- Just said to grab you and meet in Surgery.

48
00:14:44,143 --> 00:14:45,843
- Where is he?
- I'm not sure.

49
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,043
- Call him.
- OK.

50
00:14:50,144 --> 00:14:53,544
Antonio sent me ahead with the scans.
He's still busy in Chem Lab.

51
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:57,144
Breeny, it's Manny.
Where's Antonio?

52
00:14:57,244 --> 00:15:01,044
- It's still growing aggressively.
- That much in two days!

53
00:15:01,144 --> 00:15:04,145
What do you mean, you don't know?
Go get him. Find him.

54
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:10,045
He's been lying open 50 minutes now.

55
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,845
- He's crossing the street.
- The results?

56
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:18,845
- I didn't ask.
- Meet him at the elevator. Get his ass in here.

57
00:15:20,846 --> 00:15:24,945
Micromanipulators at 42 degrees,
mediolateral, 72.

58
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:26,845
Yup.

59
00:15:26,845 --> 00:15:30,046
How we doing, Donovan?
You hanging in?

60
00:15:34,246 --> 00:15:38,246
No good.
Great specificity, but no suppression.

61
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:46,647
- Shall we close?
- No, euthanize.

62
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:51,947
- Why?
- If we don't treat now, the growth gets him.

63
00:15:51,947 --> 00:15:53,948
Dammit!

64
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,050
- I'll prepare the pentabarbital.
- No, wait.

65
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:51,051
- What is it?
- That compound we played with last year.

66
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:55,851
- Which one?
- From that tree from Central America.

67
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,551
<i>- That one.
- "Natul tortuosa. 82-A46."</i>

68
00:17:02,651 --> 00:17:05,251
- From Guatemala.
- The old-growth tree.

69
00:17:05,352 --> 00:17:10,951
We had two samples, but it was sterile.
The graftings and clippings didn't take either.

70
00:17:11,051 --> 00:17:13,451
- That's it.
- What's happening?

71
00:17:13,451 --> 00:17:16,852
Mix it with your compound.
They've got a similar structure.

72
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:20,952
- Manny, find those samples.
- I don't see it.

73
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:25,252
Picture them side by side.
Fold them into each other like two lovers,

74
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,753
woman on top.

75
00:17:27,753 --> 00:17:30,053
They have complementary domains.

76
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:32,653
- If we can get them to stick...
- Is this it?

77
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:36,954
- Go!
- We have no toxicity reports, not a single...

78
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:41,253
It doesn't matter. Donovan's on the table.
If we do nothing, he dies.

79
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:43,554
- Antonio, how long?
- Two hours.

80
00:17:43,554 --> 00:17:45,854
Keep him under.

81
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:56,355
- I've never seen that adhesion pattern.
- What's it binding to it?

82
00:17:56,454 --> 00:18:02,154
I don't know. But it's definitely
attaching to the high-growth regions.

83
00:18:02,254 --> 00:18:04,255
Let's do it.

84
00:18:04,355 --> 00:18:06,655
.751, 1.25.

85
00:18:06,655 --> 00:18:10,155
- Syringe is loaded.
- Give it.

86
00:18:12,155 --> 00:18:14,256
Manny, give me light.

87
00:18:20,155 --> 00:18:22,156
Lowering.

88
00:18:23,256 --> 00:18:26,056
- Injecting.
- Injection at 23:57.

89
00:18:26,156 --> 00:18:30,256
- 23:57.
- Good boy, Donovan. Good boy.

90
00:18:46,957 --> 00:18:48,658
- What's up?
- My ring.

91
00:18:48,758 --> 00:18:50,257
- What ring?
- My wedding ring.

92
00:18:50,357 --> 00:18:54,358
- Where'd you leave it?
- Right there, where I always put it.

93
00:18:54,358 --> 00:18:58,558
- Someone must've knocked it on the ground.
- Tommy, may I have a word with you?

94
00:18:58,658 --> 00:19:01,059
- One second.
- What are you doing?

95
00:19:01,158 --> 00:19:04,759
- It's my ring. I put it there.
- It's gotta be here.

96
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:09,358
- I need to talk to you.
- Don't worry about it. We'll find it.

97
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:13,958
Tommy...

98
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:19,460
- I'm concerned.
- What?

99
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:24,759
I saw Betty in the hall. She was hysterical.
You've been running sloppy surgeries.

100
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:28,459
- Nonsense!
- You injected an untested compound.

101
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,959
He was open.
We were about to put him down.

102
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:34,660
NIH could shut us down.
I should shut you down for it.

103
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:38,560
You're reckless
and you're losing perspective.

104
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,861
Look, why don't you just
take a few days at home.

105
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:51,761
Spend a little time with Izzi.

106
00:19:51,861 --> 00:19:55,261
I'm here for her.

107
00:20:16,462 --> 00:20:18,463
Izzi.

108
00:20:23,562 --> 00:20:25,463
Izzi?

109
00:20:26,463 --> 00:20:28,263
Iz?

110
00:20:32,563 --> 00:20:34,462
Izzi?

111
00:20:37,764 --> 00:20:39,564
Izzi.

112
00:20:42,663 --> 00:20:44,464
Izzi!

113
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:49,763
Izzi!

114
00:20:49,864 --> 00:20:51,765
- Tommy?
- Isabel!

115
00:20:57,964 --> 00:21:00,565
That's funny.
Very funny.

116
00:21:01,465 --> 00:21:03,565
What are you doing?

117
00:21:03,665 --> 00:21:07,565
I'm... I'm stargazing.
I found it in the attic.

118
00:21:07,665 --> 00:21:12,265
- Come on in. It's freezing.
- I want you to see something. Come on.

119
00:21:12,365 --> 00:21:15,066
You're an old fart.

120
00:21:19,466 --> 00:21:21,066
OK.

121
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:23,766
OK.

122
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:29,267
Go on. Look.

123
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,867
- You see it?
- The gold star?

124
00:21:35,967 --> 00:21:41,567
It's actually a nebula wrapped around
a dying star. That's what makes it look gold.

125
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:44,668
What?

126
00:21:44,768 --> 00:21:47,067
- I took science.
- When?

127
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:51,068
Junior high.

128
00:21:55,268 --> 00:21:58,768
- The Mayans called it Xibalba.
- Xibalba?

129
00:22:00,568 --> 00:22:05,569
It was their underworld.
The place the dead souls go to be reborn.

130
00:22:06,068 --> 00:22:08,068
What? What are you talking about?

131
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:10,269
My book.

132
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:13,469
- I'm writing about it.
- I thought it took place in Spain.

133
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:15,668
It begins there.

134
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,970
Ends there.

135
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,269
Are you done?

136
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:22,769
- Almost.
- Good. When do I read it?

137
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:36,071
Someday soon it will explode, die,
and give birth to new stars.

138
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:41,370
How amazing that the Mayans chose
a dying star to represent their underworld.

139
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,671
Of all the healthy points of light in the sky,

140
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,372
how did they find one that was dying?

141
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:53,271
Where are your shoes?

142
00:22:57,671 --> 00:23:01,171
Izzi! Come on, come on.
Let's warm you up.

143
00:23:03,772 --> 00:23:06,072
Whoa, whoa. Careful.

144
00:23:06,172 --> 00:23:08,171
OK. I'll get it.

145
00:23:09,572 --> 00:23:11,572
Careful. Iz?

146
00:23:14,672 --> 00:23:16,472
Stop. No!

147
00:23:16,572 --> 00:23:18,472
Get inside.

148
00:23:18,572 --> 00:23:20,572
Serves you right.

149
00:24:15,075 --> 00:24:17,576
Is she a redhead?

150
00:24:18,576 --> 00:24:20,576
What?

151
00:24:23,977 --> 00:24:26,376
I left it in Surgery.

152
00:24:26,476 --> 00:24:29,477
If you can't wait, you can't wait.

153
00:24:32,378 --> 00:24:34,877
I'm joking.

154
00:24:34,977 --> 00:24:38,777
- I'll make some coffee.
- Wait. The sponge.

155
00:24:42,777 --> 00:24:45,177
I want you to heat it.

156
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,679
Outside, before,
you couldn't feel the cold.

157
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:20,480
Tommy.

158
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:25,379
- I'm calling Dr. Lipper.
- No! I'm afraid.

159
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,180
Jesus, I'm sorry.

160
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,681
- It's been happening for a while.
- What?

161
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:39,080
- I'm losing sensitivity to hot and cold.
- Why didn't you tell me?

162
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:42,281
Because I feel different inside.

163
00:25:42,281 --> 00:25:44,881
I feel different.

164
00:25:44,981 --> 00:25:47,282
Every moment.

165
00:25:47,282 --> 00:25:49,481
Each one.

166
00:25:52,481 --> 00:25:54,182
Tommy?

167
00:26:05,582 --> 00:26:06,882
Oh, Jesus.

168
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,582
Look, don't worry.
Don't worry. All right? I'm here.

169
00:26:10,683 --> 00:26:12,683
I will always be here.

170
00:26:16,883 --> 00:26:19,083
I know. Yes, I know, Iz.

171
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:40,684
Got you.

172
00:27:39,687 --> 00:27:41,187
- Hello?
- Alan? Tommy.

173
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:44,288
- Tommy.
- What's the earliest you can make tomorrow?

174
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:49,089
- Let me check my schedule.
- It's time for you to read it.

175
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:55,688
- Three? I'm in Surgery till then. Is it urgent?
- No, no. That's fine. Thanks, Alan. Bye.

176
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:59,288
- We're going to see him tomorrow.
- Start it. Tell me what you think.

177
00:27:59,288 --> 00:28:02,188
- But it's not done.
- Not quite.

178
00:28:05,988 --> 00:28:09,489
Don't answer it.

179
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:12,889
- Hello? Antonio, what's wrong?
- Can you get down here?

180
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:15,689
- What is it?
- Donovan.

181
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,690
- Is he OK?
- He's perfectly fine.

182
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:20,090
- What's happening?
- You won't believe me.

183
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,690
You've got to see for yourself.
Come right away.

184
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,790
No, I can't now. I can't.

185
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:39,590
- To Donovan!
- What's going on?

186
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:42,191
- Show him.
- I came to check up on Donovan.

187
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:45,592
- Where is Donovan?
- That's him.

188
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:49,592
What? It can't be.

189
00:28:54,992 --> 00:28:57,492
He's almost healed.
There's hair growth.

190
00:28:57,592 --> 00:29:01,391
- I didn't believe it either.
- Antonio had me run some tests.

191
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:04,593
Donovan responded well.
Really well.

192
00:29:05,492 --> 00:29:08,693
I pulled up videos of him pre-op.
He's testing twice as well.

193
00:29:08,793 --> 00:29:15,293
We're seeing an increase in neural activity
in all areas usually stunted by ageing.

194
00:29:19,693 --> 00:29:22,293
- And the tumor?
- No change.

195
00:29:24,594 --> 00:29:28,993
The growth patterns are normal.
There's no positive or negative effect.

196
00:29:28,993 --> 00:29:33,093
- We should tell Dr. Guzetti right away.
- No! No.

197
00:29:41,095 --> 00:29:42,994
Antonio,

198
00:29:43,995 --> 00:29:46,795
prep a new cocktail.
Stick with the same substance.

199
00:29:46,895 --> 00:29:48,895
What?

200
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,194
- We're moving forward.
- Wait.

201
00:29:51,295 --> 00:29:53,496
But this could be a medical first.

202
00:29:53,595 --> 00:29:56,995
A revelation! We've gotta pursue it
and duplicate the findings.

203
00:29:57,096 --> 00:30:00,896
We can monitor synaptic growth,
but our focus is tumors, not ageing.

204
00:30:00,896 --> 00:30:06,096
- I know, but...
- I want the next subject ready for surgery.

205
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:08,999
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.

206
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:11,500
Everything's all right.

207
00:33:08,005 --> 00:33:09,306
Inquisitor?

208
00:33:13,007 --> 00:33:15,306
Enter.

209
00:33:19,106 --> 00:33:21,207
The heretics.

210
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:25,508
They have confessed
and ceded their lands to your holy office.

211
00:33:25,608 --> 00:33:28,108
They await yourjudgment.

212
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:32,508
Yet another slice of her nation is mine.

213
00:33:35,507 --> 00:33:39,408
Soon she will be powerless against me.

214
00:33:41,107 --> 00:33:44,208
Queen of nothing but her sins.

215
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:47,309
What will you do with her?

216
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:50,908
She too will confess,
and then

217
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:54,109
she too will die.

218
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:33,910
Captain. 'Tis the queen.

219
00:34:34,011 --> 00:34:36,212
She is surrounded.

220
00:34:36,312 --> 00:34:38,912
The inquisitor demands blood.

221
00:34:44,911 --> 00:34:47,312
Then there is no more time.

222
00:34:52,712 --> 00:34:55,113
What is our response?

223
00:34:55,113 --> 00:34:58,013
Go now.
Warn the queen.

224
00:34:58,413 --> 00:35:01,512
- And you? Where are you going?
- He must be cut out.

225
00:35:01,612 --> 00:35:04,212
- She has forbidden it.
- There is no other choice.

226
00:35:04,312 --> 00:35:06,413
This is our only hope.

227
00:35:23,814 --> 00:35:26,413
Stay. Stay.

228
00:35:47,215 --> 00:35:52,215
Our bodies are prisons for our souls.

229
00:35:53,816 --> 00:35:59,316
Our skin and blood,
the iron bars of confinement.

230
00:36:00,916 --> 00:36:03,616
But fear not.

231
00:36:03,715 --> 00:36:05,817
All flesh decays.

232
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:10,017
Death turns all to ash,

233
00:36:11,016 --> 00:36:13,717
and, thus,

234
00:36:13,817 --> 00:36:16,517
death frees every soul.

235
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:23,117
You, the condemned,

236
00:36:23,217 --> 00:36:26,017
you have confessed.

237
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:30,818
You admit to protecting a queen

238
00:36:32,018 --> 00:36:35,118
who twists the word of God

239
00:36:35,218 --> 00:36:38,718
and drowns all Spain in sin.

240
00:36:40,017 --> 00:36:46,319
Your queen seeks immortality on Earth -
a false paradise.

241
00:36:46,419 --> 00:36:49,219
This is heresy.

242
00:36:49,219 --> 00:36:51,719
She leads you towards vanity,

243
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:54,720
away from the spirit.

244
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,320
But this is foolishness,

245
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,819
for death exists.

246
00:36:59,919 --> 00:37:02,319
The Day of Judgment is irrefutable.

247
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:05,720
All life must be judged.

248
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,820
- Why are you here?
- Come quickly.

249
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,822
- Leave. Protect the queen.
- She sent me. She demands your return.

250
00:37:27,922 --> 00:37:31,822
- Not before he dies.
- No, Tomas. Leave him.

251
00:37:31,822 --> 00:37:34,722
She desires a private audience.

252
00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:40,422
But fear not.
She will not be in hell alone.

253
00:37:40,522 --> 00:37:43,921
I will make sure
her servants are waiting for her.

254
00:38:36,925 --> 00:38:39,925
Faithful servant, why do you cry?

255
00:38:40,025 --> 00:38:43,525
To see Spain brought so low,

256
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:48,525
with an enemy thriving within her borders,
feasting on her strength.

257
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:51,325
The shame is too much.
I've failed her.

258
00:38:51,425 --> 00:38:53,726
Dare not pity Spain.

259
00:38:56,026 --> 00:38:58,726
These times are dark,

260
00:38:58,826 --> 00:39:04,226
but every shadow, no matter how deep,
is threatened by morning light.

261
00:39:04,327 --> 00:39:06,427
Of course.

262
00:39:06,526 --> 00:39:08,827
This loyalty of yours

263
00:39:08,927 --> 00:39:12,527
inspires you to protect Spain at any cost,

264
00:39:13,927 --> 00:39:17,027
but killing the inquisitor is suicide.

265
00:39:18,327 --> 00:39:20,627
Europe would have my head.

266
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:25,927
I, for one, am not ready to die yet.
Are you?

267
00:39:25,927 --> 00:39:28,627
I will die for Spain.

268
00:39:30,728 --> 00:39:33,228
I know, Conquistador.

269
00:39:33,328 --> 00:39:34,829
I know.

270
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:38,928
And this bravery of yours,
it may save us yet.

271
00:39:40,228 --> 00:39:43,529
For Spain has a plan.

272
00:39:43,629 --> 00:39:46,728
There is hope.

273
00:39:46,728 --> 00:39:49,429
- There's hope?
- Father.

274
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:12,930
I am Father Avila
of her royal Franciscan order.

275
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,631
Our allegiance remains with Spain.

276
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,630
Father.

277
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:20,430
Guards, leave us.

278
00:40:24,731 --> 00:40:26,532
Conquistador,

279
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:32,631
I am going to tell you the true reason
why the inquisitor pits cross against crown.

280
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:39,132
One year ago, Father Avila returned
from the jungles of New Spain

281
00:40:39,232 --> 00:40:41,232
with a secret so great,

282
00:40:41,332 --> 00:40:44,832
it promised to free
all mankind from tyranny.

283
00:40:44,832 --> 00:40:48,833
Spain desired this treasure
above all things,

284
00:40:48,933 --> 00:40:52,333
but the inquisitor feared it
with equal measure.

285
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:55,033
When I refused to give up my quest for it,

286
00:40:55,033 --> 00:41:00,233
he responded with this violent coup
to bring Spain to her knees.

287
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,933
But we have not yielded,

288
00:41:03,033 --> 00:41:05,933
and now we will defeat him.

289
00:41:14,033 --> 00:41:17,434
This is our hope.

290
00:41:17,534 --> 00:41:21,434
- A dagger?
- Used in religious rituals.

291
00:41:21,534 --> 00:41:24,334
I took it from a dead Mayan priest.

292
00:41:27,134 --> 00:41:29,435
The marking on the hilt...

293
00:41:31,335 --> 00:41:34,336
Do you see it?

294
00:41:40,235 --> 00:41:42,335
It is a map.

295
00:41:42,936 --> 00:41:46,535
A map to the Mayans' greatest secret.

296
00:41:46,636 --> 00:41:51,936
Greater than Chichen Itzá, greater than
Yaxchilán, greater even than Tikal.

297
00:41:52,036 --> 00:41:57,035
Here, in the centre, in the core
of the once-great Mayan civilization,

298
00:41:57,136 --> 00:42:01,536
we will find a lost pyramid.

299
00:42:02,536 --> 00:42:04,937
No.

300
00:42:05,037 --> 00:42:06,837
Not lost.

301
00:42:06,937 --> 00:42:12,437
Hidden.
The hidden pyramid of the Mayan myths.

302
00:42:12,537 --> 00:42:16,037
The myths tell us of a holy pyramid,

303
00:42:16,137 --> 00:42:18,938
built upon the navel of the Earth,

304
00:42:18,938 --> 00:42:21,938
the birthplace of life.

305
00:42:22,939 --> 00:42:25,638
A special tree sprouts there.

306
00:42:26,938 --> 00:42:31,138
They say whoever drinks of its sap

307
00:42:31,238 --> 00:42:34,139
will live forever.

308
00:42:35,638 --> 00:42:37,839
Eternal life?

309
00:42:39,038 --> 00:42:43,539
Spain hangs at the whims of a merciless
enemy and you taunt us with yarns?

310
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:46,239
They are not yarns.

311
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:49,639
Remember,

312
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:52,140
our own Bible confirms it.

313
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,140
In Genesis, there are two trees
in the Garden of Eden -

314
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,940
the Tree of Knowledge
and the Tree of Life.

315
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,340
When Adam and Eve disobeyed the Lord
and ate from the Tree of Knowledge,

316
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,341
the Lord banned them from the garden
and hid the Tree of Life.

317
00:43:39,442 --> 00:43:41,442
Could it be?

318
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:48,043
Could it be?

319
00:43:49,642 --> 00:43:52,043
Kneel, Conquistador.

320
00:43:57,443 --> 00:44:00,242
Let in the morning light.

321
00:44:16,444 --> 00:44:19,944
The beast runs amok in my kingdom.

322
00:44:20,944 --> 00:44:23,844
He has isolated me,

323
00:44:23,944 --> 00:44:28,945
and now he is sharpening his talons
for one more fateful push.

324
00:44:30,245 --> 00:44:34,045
But salvation lies
in the jungles of New Spain.

325
00:44:51,047 --> 00:44:54,047
Will you deliver Spain from bondage?

326
00:44:54,146 --> 00:44:57,046
Upon my honor and my life.

327
00:45:07,447 --> 00:45:12,347
Then you shall take this ring
to remind you of your promise.

328
00:45:15,347 --> 00:45:18,648
You shall wear it when you find Eden,

329
00:45:18,648 --> 00:45:21,248
and when you return,

330
00:45:21,248 --> 00:45:23,448
I shall be your Eve.

331
00:45:26,648 --> 00:45:29,648
Together, we will live forever.

332
00:45:46,249 --> 00:45:48,049
Iz?

333
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,749
Izzi?

334
00:46:18,251 --> 00:46:21,152
- There you are.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

335
00:46:21,252 --> 00:46:25,951
- Babe, we have Lipper at three.
- This is an actual Mayan book.

336
00:46:26,051 --> 00:46:31,452
Look. It explains their creation myth. You see,
that's First Father. He's the very first human.

337
00:46:31,552 --> 00:46:33,752
Is he dead?

338
00:46:33,851 --> 00:46:37,552
He sacrificed himself to make the world.

339
00:46:38,052 --> 00:46:41,152
- The Tree of Life's bursting out of his belly.
- Come on.

340
00:46:41,252 --> 00:46:47,053
Listen. His body became the tree's roots.
They spread and formed the Earth.

341
00:46:47,053 --> 00:46:51,053
His soul became the branches,
rising up, forming the sky.

342
00:46:51,153 --> 00:46:53,653
All that remained
was First Father's head.

343
00:46:53,653 --> 00:46:57,653
His children hung it in the heavens,
creating Xibalba.

344
00:46:57,653 --> 00:47:00,153
Xibalba? The star.

345
00:47:00,253 --> 00:47:02,354
Nebula.

346
00:47:02,454 --> 00:47:04,954
- So what do you think?
- About?

347
00:47:05,054 --> 00:47:06,954
That idea.

348
00:47:07,054 --> 00:47:10,053
Death as an act of creation.

349
00:47:12,854 --> 00:47:15,054
Stay together, guys.

350
00:47:16,255 --> 00:47:19,754
I'll pull out the car
and meet you in front.

351
00:47:42,556 --> 00:47:44,555
Iz. Iz!

352
00:48:09,658 --> 00:48:11,958
- Tommy.
- Hey.

353
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:15,458
Tommy.

354
00:48:22,158 --> 00:48:24,757
You're all right.

355
00:48:26,658 --> 00:48:29,058
- I'm close.
- No.

356
00:48:29,058 --> 00:48:30,859
There are options.

357
00:48:30,959 --> 00:48:34,859
- We'll have to make some choices.
- Alan?

358
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:41,959
You had a minor seizure. The growth in
your brainstem's back and it's growing faster.

359
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,359
- The next time...
- No!

360
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:46,960
No.

361
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:49,160
We had a breakthrough.

362
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,060
I know I can translate it to help you.

363
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,360
I just need a little more time, OK?

364
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:57,960
There's hope.
There's real hope.

365
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,261
- Tommy.
- What? What, baby?

366
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,561
- I wasn't afraid.
- I know.

367
00:49:08,661 --> 00:49:11,361
You're very strong.

368
00:49:11,361 --> 00:49:13,260
No.

369
00:49:14,461 --> 00:49:17,461
- No.
- What?

370
00:49:17,561 --> 00:49:19,862
When I fell

371
00:49:21,861 --> 00:49:24,361
I was full.

372
00:49:26,662 --> 00:49:28,661
Held.

373
00:49:30,662 --> 00:49:33,663
I know.
I caught you. I held you.

374
00:49:40,363 --> 00:49:44,463
It's OK, Iz.
Everything's gonna be all right.

375
00:49:52,764 --> 00:49:54,863
There's time.
We have time.

376
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:27,765
We need to examine
the hippocampal region.

377
00:50:27,865 --> 00:50:31,866
- What the hell's going on?
- I brought in Dean Katari and Dr...

378
00:50:31,966 --> 00:50:33,866
I'm sorry, what are you doing here?

379
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:40,766
- Antonio and Betty were just showing me...
- Donovan's synaptic growth increased.

380
00:50:40,866 --> 00:50:44,266
His brain is identical to scans
from 12 years ago, when he was six.

381
00:50:44,766 --> 00:50:47,066
And the tumor?

382
00:50:51,566 --> 00:50:53,867
- Exactly. Please?
- Tommy...

383
00:50:53,867 --> 00:50:56,367
Please!

384
00:50:56,467 --> 00:51:01,466
Perhaps you should wait for me in my office.
Manny. I'll be right there.

385
00:51:01,466 --> 00:51:05,167
- Thomas, I'd like a word with you in private.
- After surgery.

386
00:51:17,568 --> 00:51:19,468
First cut.

387
00:51:22,268 --> 00:51:25,369
Tommy.
Dr. Lipperjust called.

388
00:51:25,369 --> 00:51:31,369
He said Izzi's doing better and they're gonna
move her to a regular floor in the morning.

389
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:49,471
When we're done here,
I want you to prep Cain.

390
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:57,470
I'll get her.
She'll take care of it.

391
00:52:17,072 --> 00:52:20,171
What do you think you're doing?

392
00:52:20,271 --> 00:52:24,672
You don't abandon results like that.
You repeat the procedure, get a confirmation.

393
00:52:24,772 --> 00:52:30,373
Confirmation that the tumor's unaffected?
She'll be dead by then.

394
00:52:30,373 --> 00:52:32,373
Tommy.

395
00:52:35,872 --> 00:52:37,773
She had a seizure.

396
00:52:40,973 --> 00:52:43,473
I'm so sorry.

397
00:52:45,373 --> 00:52:47,674
- How's she doing?
- She's stable.

398
00:52:49,074 --> 00:52:51,073
Who's with her?

399
00:52:52,474 --> 00:52:55,073
- She's alone?
- She needs to rest.

400
00:52:55,174 --> 00:53:00,175
No one invents new drugs overnight. No one!
You're not being rational.

401
00:53:00,175 --> 00:53:03,174
- You can't fix everything!
- Don't tell me what I can do.

402
00:53:03,274 --> 00:53:09,374
- Your wife needs you. Why are you here?
- Why the fuck do you think I'm here?

403
00:53:18,076 --> 00:53:19,975
Shit.

404
00:54:25,479 --> 00:54:27,678
I'll leave you two alone.

405
00:54:29,279 --> 00:54:32,179
Lilly, I'm sorry about before.

406
00:54:35,279 --> 00:54:37,380
She's amazing.

407
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,180
Lillian,

408
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,780
could...

409
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,880
could you have Henry
re-scan the animals for me?

410
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,080
- OK.
- Thanks.

411
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:56,180
- Hey.
- Hey.

412
00:54:57,881 --> 00:55:02,181
I brought your manuscript
in case you want to work.

413
00:55:07,581 --> 00:55:09,681
How are you feeling?

414
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,481
Good.

415
00:55:15,682 --> 00:55:17,682
I'm sorry.

416
00:55:20,782 --> 00:55:22,882
What about?

417
00:55:30,782 --> 00:55:32,983
There's been progress at work.

418
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:39,283
My conquistador.
Always conquering.

419
00:55:39,384 --> 00:55:43,783
- No. Something amazing. We tested...
- That's for you.

420
00:55:44,683 --> 00:55:47,484
It's for me? What is it?

421
00:55:47,584 --> 00:55:49,583
Open it.

422
00:56:10,884 --> 00:56:13,585
Pen and ink. For writing.

423
00:56:21,686 --> 00:56:25,186
It's all done except the last chapter.

424
00:56:27,186 --> 00:56:29,187
I want you to help me.

425
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:32,386
How?

426
00:56:32,486 --> 00:56:34,686
Finish it.

427
00:56:37,486 --> 00:56:39,386
Finish it.

428
00:56:39,486 --> 00:56:41,986
- I don't know how it ends.
- You do.

429
00:56:43,087 --> 00:56:45,387
You will.

430
00:56:45,387 --> 00:56:47,388
Stop.

431
00:56:53,187 --> 00:56:56,487
- Remember Moses Morales?
- Who?

432
00:56:58,088 --> 00:57:01,387
- The Mayan guide I told you about.
- From your trip?

433
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:06,787
The last night I was with him,
he told me about his father who had died.

434
00:57:06,887 --> 00:57:08,888
- But Moses wouldn't believe it.
- Izzi!

435
00:57:08,988 --> 00:57:12,588
No, no. Listen. Listen.

436
00:57:12,688 --> 00:57:16,289
He said if they dug his father's body up,

437
00:57:17,589 --> 00:57:19,588
he would be gone.

438
00:57:20,789 --> 00:57:23,989
They'd planted a seed over his grave.

439
00:57:24,089 --> 00:57:26,089
The seed became a tree.

440
00:57:27,689 --> 00:57:31,989
Moses said his father became part of that tree.

441
00:57:31,989 --> 00:57:36,489
He grew into the wood, into the bloom.

442
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:42,691
And when a sparrow ate the tree's fruit,

443
00:57:43,591 --> 00:57:46,290
his father flew with the birds.

444
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:49,990
He said

445
00:57:52,391 --> 00:57:55,290
death was his father's road to awe.

446
00:57:57,791 --> 00:57:59,891
That's what he called it.

447
00:58:01,091 --> 00:58:03,091
The road to awe.

448
00:58:04,991 --> 00:58:07,492
Now,

449
00:58:07,492 --> 00:58:11,991
I've been trying to write the last chapter and
I haven't been able to get that out of my head.

450
00:58:12,091 --> 00:58:14,592
Why are you telling me this?

451
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,992
I'm not afraid anymore, Tommy.

452
00:58:29,693 --> 00:58:34,493
I asked Lilly if I could be buried at her farm.

453
00:58:34,593 --> 00:58:36,892
No, stop it!

454
00:58:39,294 --> 00:58:43,494
- I want you to be with me.
- I am with you. Look.

455
00:58:44,694 --> 00:58:47,094
I'll always be with you.

456
00:58:49,594 --> 00:58:51,293
I promise.

457
00:58:56,294 --> 00:58:59,294
Will you stay with me tonight?

458
00:59:01,095 --> 00:59:03,494
Yeah. I'll stay.

459
00:59:11,295 --> 00:59:13,295
I'll stay.

460
01:00:03,098 --> 01:00:04,899
Don't worry,

461
01:00:05,697 --> 01:00:07,698
we're almost there.

462
01:00:12,099 --> 01:00:15,699
Through that last dark cloud is a dying star.

463
01:00:19,399 --> 01:00:22,499
And soon enough, Xibalba will die.

464
01:00:24,299 --> 01:00:27,500
And when it explodes,
you will be reborn.

465
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,799
You will bloom.

466
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,199
And I will live.

467
01:01:10,502 --> 01:01:13,401
Don't worry.
We're almost there.

468
01:04:02,912 --> 01:04:06,712
Thank you, Lord! We are here!

469
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:11,612
Circles.

470
01:04:12,812 --> 01:04:15,012
He leads us in circles.

471
01:04:16,812 --> 01:04:20,312
Only we are left.
All of your countrymen are dead.

472
01:04:20,412 --> 01:04:24,113
He killed them all with this blind quest.

473
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:30,312
It's time. Time to stop him.

474
01:04:51,615 --> 01:04:54,615
Captain, we are lost.

475
01:04:54,715 --> 01:04:58,615
The Franciscan and his tales are false.

476
01:04:58,715 --> 01:05:00,914
There is no hope for us here.

477
01:05:02,615 --> 01:05:04,615
There's only death.

478
01:05:05,515 --> 01:05:10,016
- I've mapped us a course back to the ships.
- Coward.

479
01:05:10,816 --> 01:05:12,716
Damn the maps!

480
01:05:17,516 --> 01:05:20,116
We're close and I will find it.

481
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:23,216
Captain! Captain! Captain!

482
01:05:23,316 --> 01:05:26,017
Father. What is it, Franciscan?

483
01:05:27,016 --> 01:05:29,017
In the jungle...

484
01:05:29,117 --> 01:05:31,517
The marking on the hilt.

485
01:05:31,617 --> 01:05:35,617
- On the dagger?
- It is the same. The same as on the stone.

486
01:05:56,117 --> 01:06:00,718
Your choice - die now
or, by my side, fight and live.

487
01:06:12,619 --> 01:06:16,319
- You fool.
- Captain!

488
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:18,519
Father.

489
01:06:18,519 --> 01:06:20,819
Take it.

490
01:06:20,819 --> 01:06:22,619
We are here.

491
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:25,120
- Where?
- The temple is there.

492
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,921
Sorry, Father.

493
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,721
For you, there is only death.

494
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:40,920
But our destiny is life.

495
01:07:07,422 --> 01:07:10,721
You shall wear it when you find Eden,

496
01:07:10,821 --> 01:07:15,322
and when you return,
I shall be your Eve.

497
01:07:25,623 --> 01:07:27,723
Iz! Iz!

498
01:07:33,723 --> 01:07:35,824
Come on, come on, come on!

499
01:07:35,924 --> 01:07:38,324
Oh, no. Please! Please!

500
01:07:40,824 --> 01:07:43,325
- Step aside.
- She's in V-fib. Pulse thready.

501
01:07:43,425 --> 01:07:45,524
- I'm bagging. Sir! Sir!
- Izzi! Izzi!

502
01:07:45,624 --> 01:07:48,524
- Get the family out. Get him out!
- Sir, please!

503
01:07:48,624 --> 01:07:49,924
- Pads.
- Charging.

504
01:07:50,025 --> 01:07:51,225
- Pulse?
- Thready.

505
01:07:51,225 --> 01:07:52,424
Pressure?

506
01:07:56,725 --> 01:07:58,726
Oh, God.

507
01:08:20,026 --> 01:08:21,726
Tommy.

508
01:08:23,627 --> 01:08:25,726
I know. I know.

509
01:08:25,826 --> 01:08:28,627
I've never seen anything like it.

510
01:08:28,727 --> 01:08:31,026
- Antonio didn't reach you?
- What?

511
01:08:31,026 --> 01:08:34,527
It's Donovan.
The growth is shrinking.

512
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:37,027
It's like the disease is cured.

513
01:08:39,728 --> 01:08:41,928
Izzi.

514
01:08:41,928 --> 01:08:43,927
Izzi!

515
01:08:46,928 --> 01:08:49,328
Izzi!

516
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:55,528
- No, no, no, no!
- Sir. Please, sir.

517
01:08:55,628 --> 01:08:56,828
Sir!

518
01:08:56,828 --> 01:09:00,829
Sir, it's too late.
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

519
01:09:00,929 --> 01:09:03,729
- Sir, it's too late.
- You killed my wife!

520
01:09:03,729 --> 01:09:06,629
- Get off him! Let go!
- Let go!

521
01:09:39,931 --> 01:09:41,431
No.

522
01:09:43,331 --> 01:09:44,430
No.

523
01:09:44,530 --> 01:09:45,732
No!

524
01:09:45,831 --> 01:09:48,331
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

525
01:09:48,432 --> 01:09:50,931
Don't die! Don't die!
Don't die! Don't die!

526
01:09:51,031 --> 01:09:52,931
No! No!

527
01:09:53,031 --> 01:09:55,031
No!

528
01:10:24,234 --> 01:10:30,734
It seems to me that we struggle
all our lives to become whole.

529
01:10:33,634 --> 01:10:36,234
Complete enough when we die

530
01:10:38,235 --> 01:10:40,634
to achieve a measure of grace.

531
01:10:43,534 --> 01:10:45,534
Few of us ever do.

532
01:10:47,334 --> 01:10:53,135
Most of us end up going out
the way we came in, kicking and screaming.

533
01:10:57,536 --> 01:11:02,335
But somehow Izzi, young as she was,

534
01:11:03,936 --> 01:11:06,635
she achieved that grace.

535
01:11:06,736 --> 01:11:09,836
In her last days she became whole.

536
01:11:10,636 --> 01:11:12,737
She saw her...

537
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:15,637
Tommy!

538
01:11:19,337 --> 01:11:21,836
- Tommy...
- Just stop it!

539
01:11:28,037 --> 01:11:31,937
Death is a disease.
It's like any other.

540
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:34,838
And there's a cure.

541
01:11:34,938 --> 01:11:36,338
A cure.

542
01:11:36,438 --> 01:11:38,838
And I will find it.

543
01:11:53,238 --> 01:11:54,438
No!

544
01:14:28,447 --> 01:14:30,448
All these years.

545
01:14:32,148 --> 01:14:34,447
All these memories.

546
01:14:37,248 --> 01:14:39,248
There's been you.

547
01:14:50,048 --> 01:14:51,048
You...

548
01:14:51,148 --> 01:14:53,448
You pulled me through time.

549
01:15:05,349 --> 01:15:07,149
Dr. Creo?

550
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:26,450
Dr. Creo, we heard you were back.

551
01:15:27,551 --> 01:15:32,951
Update me on everything we know
about that tree. Every detail.

552
01:15:43,351 --> 01:15:46,051
I'm OK. Everything's fine.

553
01:15:48,553 --> 01:15:52,353
The Donovan breakthrough's
our starting point. It's a starting point.

554
01:15:52,453 --> 01:15:54,652
Right, let's build on it.

555
01:15:54,652 --> 01:15:57,252
Stop ageing, stop dying.

556
01:15:57,252 --> 01:15:59,453
Stop dying, that's our goal.

557
01:15:59,553 --> 01:16:03,253
Scans. Cultures. Charts.
Let's get to work.

558
01:16:09,653 --> 01:16:11,953
Come on, let's get to work.

559
01:16:39,954 --> 01:16:41,854
Xibalba.

560
01:16:51,255 --> 01:16:53,855
We're here.

561
01:17:19,657 --> 01:17:21,657
We almost made it.

562
01:17:26,657 --> 01:17:28,657
I'm sorry.

563
01:17:30,157 --> 01:17:32,058
I'm sorry.

564
01:17:32,158 --> 01:17:34,758
Finish it.

565
01:17:37,758 --> 01:17:40,858
Stop it. Stop it!

566
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:45,058
What do you want?

567
01:17:46,558 --> 01:17:48,558
Leave me! Leave me alone!

568
01:17:50,559 --> 01:17:53,659
Please, please. I'm afraid.

569
01:18:38,261 --> 01:18:40,961
Will you deliver Spain from bondage?

570
01:18:43,962 --> 01:18:45,862
I don't know.

571
01:18:45,961 --> 01:18:48,362
I'm trying. I don't know how.

572
01:18:48,462 --> 01:18:50,462
You do.

573
01:18:51,661 --> 01:18:53,662
You will.

574
01:18:56,162 --> 01:18:58,163
You do.

575
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:02,762
You will.

576
01:19:12,864 --> 01:19:16,364
I'm not afraid anymore, Tommy.

577
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:23,164
I'm gonna die.

578
01:19:27,964 --> 01:19:30,364
I'm going to die.

579
01:19:30,464 --> 01:19:33,564
Together we will live forever.

580
01:19:35,165 --> 01:19:37,165
Forever.

581
01:19:37,165 --> 01:19:39,365
Forever.

582
01:19:59,565 --> 01:20:01,567
Forever.

583
01:20:11,167 --> 01:20:13,666
We will live forever.

584
01:20:20,768 --> 01:20:23,367
Finish it.

585
01:20:24,967 --> 01:20:26,968
OK.

586
01:20:29,768 --> 01:20:32,168
- What are you doing here?
- Take a walk with me.

587
01:20:32,168 --> 01:20:35,169
- I have to work.
- It's the first snow. We always...

588
01:20:35,169 --> 01:20:37,668
They're waiting on me.

589
01:20:37,768 --> 01:20:40,769
- Come on, Tommy.
- Please, Izzi.

590
01:20:42,169 --> 01:20:45,068
I'm sorry. I am.

591
01:20:46,469 --> 01:20:48,569
I'll see you tonight, OK?

592
01:20:54,669 --> 01:20:55,869
Izzi.

593
01:20:55,969 --> 01:20:58,870
Hey! Dr. Creo.
Antonio's on his way back.

594
01:20:59,669 --> 01:21:03,770
Donovan's open and ready.
His vitals are steady.

595
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:07,770
Come on. Let's go.

596
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:13,170
Dr. Creo, where are you going?

597
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:16,671
Izzi!

598
01:21:16,871 --> 01:21:17,870
Izzi.

599
01:22:28,574 --> 01:22:30,575
No!

600
01:22:36,875 --> 01:22:39,575
Finish it.

601
01:23:43,179 --> 01:23:44,779
Behold.

602
01:26:07,886 --> 01:26:10,188
My queen.

603
01:26:11,288 --> 01:26:13,288
Now and forever.

604
01:26:14,088 --> 01:26:16,087
We shall be together.

605
01:29:34,699 --> 01:29:36,699
Bye, Iz.

606
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:52,199
I finished it.

607
01:29:52,299 --> 01:29:54,701
Is everything all right?

608
01:29:54,801 --> 01:29:56,900
Yes.

609
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Everything's all right.
