00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Bad Lieutenant

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,500
The Bad Lieutenant
Port of Call - New Orleans

1
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,592
Oh, shit.

2
00:01:11,403 --> 00:01:12,700
Duffy split.

3
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:15,764
Yeah, wasn't that Duffy?

4
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:18,173
Duffy rolls outta here
in a brand new Cadillac.

5
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:22,146
The lad has the nerve to ask me
to clean up his fucking locker and save it for him.

6
00:01:22,214 --> 00:01:24,307
Probably has dirty
pictures of his wife.

7
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:26,248
I don't know what
the fuck is in here.

8
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:34,587
Uh-huh.

9
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,685
He does have dirty
pictures of his wife.

10
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:38,992
Yes. He does.

11
00:01:39,064 --> 00:01:42,090
Lucky man.
Look at her hooters.

12
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,329
You like that, huh?

13
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:47,839
All right. This is
what I'm gonna do.

14
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,636
I'm gonna keep them.

15
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:52,074
Well, no, I gotta
answer to Duffy for that.

16
00:01:52,144 --> 00:01:53,509
I'll answer to him.

17
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,706
He is a duffus but
he's not a bad guy.

18
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:59,740
Fuck Duffy.
Just fuck him. Fuck all of them.

19
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,451
Five copies of
an arrest report.

20
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:08,357
If the prisoner was
transported, there wouldn't still be five copies here.

21
00:02:08,427 --> 00:02:11,555
Duffy might've left him
downstairs. What's his name? Chavez.

22
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,598
Let's go find him.

23
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,669
[door bangs]

24
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:22,229
Who's there?

25
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:27,568
It's strange, 'cause
the manifest says the prisoners all evacuated.

26
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:29,807
Anything's possible
in this storm.

27
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:32,316
I feel a bet coming on.
Shall we open the casino?

28
00:02:32,384 --> 00:02:33,544
Please.

29
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:37,146
All right.
Up to his nose by 4:00.

30
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,316
What the fuck
took you so long, man? Please.

31
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:41,052
Please what, shitbird?

32
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:43,390
Get me the fuck
outta here, man. The water's rising.

33
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:46,761
It's been rising for like
three hours. It's already up to my neck.

34
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:51,701
I'm not gonna be able to stay
here long, man. I'll drown. The water doesn't stop.

35
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:56,173
Get me the fuck outta here.
There's fucking snakes and shit in this water.

36
00:02:56,242 --> 00:03:01,077
Twenty bucks
and the Polaroid he says nothing before five.

37
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:05,310
Twenty bucks. What the fuck
is that? Let's make it worth our while, at least. A dime.

38
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:07,147
I'm not betting
you $1,000.

39
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:08,811
Five hundred.

40
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:12,051
Get me the fuck
outta here, man! The water keeps rising.

41
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:14,149
Two hundred
and the Polaroids.

42
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:15,488
Please, motherfuckers.

43
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:18,587
Please what, shit turd?

44
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:21,827
Got a broke leg.
Please, get me out of here.

45
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:26,099
Wait a minute.
You want me to get wet on account of you?

46
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:28,105
Think the world
owes you a living, huh?

47
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:29,470
I'll drown.

48
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,975
Hey, man, I got on
Swiss cotton underpants.

49
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:34,740
Yeah, that's right.
Cost me $55 a pair.

50
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:37,976
You think I wanna get
all this brown water and shit all over?

51
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,312
That don't come out.

52
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,615
You got underwear on
that cost $55?

53
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:43,814
My girl gave them to me.

54
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:46,255
[mumbles]

55
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:51,085
Come on, we get
the time of death from autopsy.

56
00:03:52,798 --> 00:03:53,822
What are you doing?

57
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:55,526
Hold this.

58
00:03:56,702 --> 00:03:58,226
Oh, come on, man.

59
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,137
Let the Fire Department
get him out. What are you, crazy?

60
00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:03,106
He ain't worth it!

61
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:05,405
Come on, man.

62
00:04:05,477 --> 00:04:07,968
[laughing]
You are crazy.

63
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:10,038
[laughs]

64
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:14,142
[voice echoing]
You okay, man? You okay?

65
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:20,386
The good news, Terence,
is I'll okay you to return to full duty.

66
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,484
The bad news is
that in all likely

67
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:26,793
you'll be experiencing
moderate to severe back pain.

68
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:28,423
How severe?

69
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,866
You'll wanna be taking
something for it.

70
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:34,872
Gonna write you a
prescription for Vicodin.

71
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,430
For how long?

72
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:37,702
From now on.

73
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:40,711
No. For how long
am I gonna have pain?

74
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:43,179
We're gonna try to manage
this as along as we can.

75
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:44,772
For the rest
of my life?

76
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,377
Probably. But they're
making advancements every day, so,

77
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,718
just work with me
on this, all right?

78
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:54,316
Now, when this runs
out, call the office.

79
00:04:56,562 --> 00:05:00,259
[applauses]

80
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:04,029
Thank you for
helping me honor our fallen heroes today.

81
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:07,402
We will now move on
to the awards and promotions.

82
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:12,069
Among those
being promoted to lieutenant today,

83
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:14,544
it gives me
great pleasure

84
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:18,572
to additionally award
the Distinguish Service Cross

85
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,484
to Sergeant
now Lieutenant Terence McDonagh,

86
00:05:22,554 --> 00:05:26,957
in recognition
of extreme valor in the line of duty.

87
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,460
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

88
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:32,827

[Police radio chatter]

90
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:51,972
There's three more.

91
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,547
You don't wanna look.
It's execution style.

92
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,061
What did you
come up with?

93
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:23,006
Scale in the closet,
bundle of glass in envelopes.

94
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,133
Dob been around?

95
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:25,699
I thought he went away.

96
00:07:25,777 --> 00:07:28,803
He's out.
I saw him the other day.

97
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,405
Let's get him in.

98
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:33,349
His baby mama is over
by General Taylor and Annunciation.

99
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:35,147
You have informers
doing the canvass?

100
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,915
The duty captain
sent them out.

101
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:40,789
Whoever they talk to,
I want followed up by a member of the squad.

102
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:43,384
You'll see to that
personally, Armand.

103
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:45,089
Are they pulling
security cameras?

104
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,256
Yeah.

105
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:47,923
Every license plate
in the area.

106
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,558
Got it.

107
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:17,218
My Friend

108
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,560
"My friend is a fish.

109
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:21,292
"He live in my room.

110
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:24,858
"His fin is a cloud.

111
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,997
He see me
when I sleep."

Immigration status: illegal.

117
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,983
From what we know,

118
00:09:16,054 --> 00:09:21,356
Dauta had been dealing
heroin to supplement his income as a peddler.

119
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:24,224
Now, I want
every drug dealer,

120
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:27,094
every junkie within
a five-mile radius

121
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:30,430
hassled into giving up
who his supplier was.

122
00:09:30,502 --> 00:09:32,265
Due to the nature
of this crime,

123
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:35,204
you've got full
authorization for overtime if you need it.

124
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,300
Lieutenant McDonagh's
gonna be heading up the investigation,

125
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,174
so coordinate with him.

126
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:42,975
That's it.
Let's see some results.

127
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:45,881
McDonagh, see you
in my office for a minute.

128
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,526
You up to this?

129
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:58,654
Why wouldn't I be?

130
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,324
I know you're still
having problems with your back.

131
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,664
Dealing with being
in pain a lot of the time.

132
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:05,327
I'm managing.

133
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,531
You still taking
medication for it?

134
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:11,369
Only what
the doctor prescribes.

135
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:15,636
Ordinarily there'd be
somebody with more time on the job

136
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:17,648
handling this kind
of investigation.

137
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:21,015
But I'm gonna go out
on a limb with you 'cause you got good instincts

138
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:23,452
and do nothing'
but work.

139
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:26,821
But if I find
that you needed help and didn't ask for it,

140
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,792
I will be mad.

141
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,725
Yes, Sir.

142
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,627
How is your
old man doing?

143
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:36,759
He's drinking himself
into an early grave.

144
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:38,268
Give him my best,
would you?

145
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,599
I will.

146
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:44,040
Lieutenant, no more
unnecessary jumps, huh?

147
00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:46,043
Yes, Sir.

148
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:07,564
Good morning,
Mr. McDonagh.

149
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,011
Hi, honey.

150
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,158
You bring me something?

151
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,488
You're out already?

152
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,391
Yes.

154
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:52,102

[man on answering machine]
Frankie, hi. This is Andy.

157
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:10,218
Hey, hey, hey!
Hoping to see if you have any time tonight.

158
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:14,061
I'm at the Monteleone.

159
00:12:14,132 --> 00:12:16,623
You need to call him back?

160
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:18,168
No.

161
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:21,637
You know I'd rather go
to the Monteleone with you.

162
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:24,038
I can't afford it.

163
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:27,408
I can.
I can afford it.

164
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,857
[cell phone rings]

165
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,694
Yeah?

166
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,529
Who brought him in?

167
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:51,626
That's who's
questioning him?

168
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,564
I'll be there in ten
minutes. Tell him I'm on my way.

169
00:12:56,641 --> 00:13:00,008
Tell him if he puts his
hands on this guy, he's gonna have a problem.

170
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,208
I don't give a shit, Armand.
You tell him to take a fucking break!

171
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:08,275
Excuse me. Could you
tell me how much longer that's gonna be?

172
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:11,481
Hello, Miss?
I'm a Lieutenant in the Police Department.

173
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:13,990
I'm in the middle of
a homicide investigation.

174
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,357
Can I get my
prescription, please?

175
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:19,192
Do you see
I'm on the phone?

176
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:22,363
Hey, you can't
come back here.

177
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,995
You got me waiting 40 minutes
so you can make a fuck personal phone call!

178
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,973
Security. Security
to Pharmacy. Security to Pharmacy, please.

179
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:35,069
This is it.
This is it. Police emergency.

180
00:13:35,146 --> 00:13:36,545
You're no cop.

181
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:37,775
What's that look like?

182
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:40,841
Why are you acting
all crazy for?

183
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:43,752
This is, uh, $23
with my copay, right?

184
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,188
There's 40. Give
everybody a drink.

185
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,419
Get the fuck
out of my way.

186
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:53,089
(detective)
Dob, look at me.

187
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:55,155
Okay?

188
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:57,201
Two hours.
That's enough.

189
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,295
Tell me something
I don't know.

190
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,067
Man, you gotta
get me outta here.

191
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,698
Get you outta here?
Are you crazy?

192
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,369
I got you on possession.
You're on parole.

193
00:14:06,444 --> 00:14:08,742
Maybe but one
skinny ass joint.

194
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:11,043
That joint's gonna
get you back.

195
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,414
I've got five
dead people, man.

196
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:14,611
You understand?

197
00:14:14,686 --> 00:14:16,278
I don't know
nothin' about it.

198
00:14:16,354 --> 00:14:18,219
Tell me something.

199
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,258
What do you
want me to tell you?

200
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:23,692
I want you to tell me
something I haven't heard. I don't want you to tell me,

201
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,856
look at me, I don't
want you to tell me that you don't know nothing.

202
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,492
But I don't know nothing.

203
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,433
Did you tell him
what I said?

204
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,164
You understand
what that means?

205
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:37,038
I'm entitled to whatever
I want in this room.

206
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:40,373
That means Guantanamo
Bay. You believe this motherfucker?

207
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:44,108
I've busted my ass
for yambos and this yambo tell me shit.

208
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:46,673
Detective, can I see you
outside for a second?

209
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:50,209
Uh, yeah, sure.
Two minutes.

210
00:14:50,288 --> 00:14:52,017
Think about it.

211
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,255
Uh, not a great time
to take a break.

212
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,316
What are you doing?

213
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:57,622
He's about to go.

214
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,323
Bullshit.
He's scared out of his mind.

215
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:02,093
You and your partner made
a spectacle out of picking him up.

216
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,136
Everyone in Central City
knows he's in here. No, just shush.

217
00:15:05,203 --> 00:15:07,967
You think he's gonna go out
if you keep insulting him like that?

218
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:10,234
You trying to tell me
how to do my interrogation?

219
00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:13,141
Yes. I'm gonna tell you
when you're doing something wrong.

220
00:15:13,211 --> 00:15:15,304
Go fuck yourself.

221
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,871
I'm gonna treat
you respectfully.

222
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:20,478
You treat me respectfully.

223
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:23,680
I'm looking at some bullshit
pot busting. Because you're on parole

224
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:26,246
you wind up back
in Angola. Why would you do that?

225
00:15:26,324 --> 00:15:28,451
I ain't the one
doing it.

226
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:30,653
Who did have
Kingard piss off?

227
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,721
I never said two
words to him. I don't know.

228
00:15:33,798 --> 00:15:36,562
But you knew he
was selling dope. Come on.

229
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:43,199
Shall I call your parole
officer? Stop wasting my time.

230
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:45,105
I knew he was selling.

231
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:49,408
Okay. Tell me
where he was selling, whose neighborhood was it.

232
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:53,008
Man, look. I got
me a good job at a cleaning service.

233
00:15:53,084 --> 00:15:55,314
I check in when
I'm supposed to.

234
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,719
I smoke a little
weed, but that's it.

235
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:01,088
Tell me whose
neighborhood it was, Dob.

236
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:08,060
Man.

237
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,596
You know Fate?

238
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,436
Big Fate? Yeah.

239
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:21,912
Ain't nothin' moved
that part of town. He ain't got a piece of it.

240
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,210
Where can I find him?

241
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:27,945
Shit. I'm saying
all I know.

242
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,750
If you want me
to lead you to him, you well just lock me up.

243
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,226
Check Stevie's arrest
report on Dob.

244
00:16:44,302 --> 00:16:47,271
If it mentions marijuana,
make sure it gets lost.

245
00:16:47,338 --> 00:16:49,067
What do I tell Stevie?

246
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,903
You can tell him
to go fuck himself.

247
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:54,103
I'm gonna go upstairs
and crash an hour in the crib.

248
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:21,133
What do you want, Mundt?

249
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,246
Internal Affairs
is checking the property room vouchers.

250
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,781
So?

251
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,443
That means they're
gonna find out the shit missing.

252
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:35,509
Not if you don't
tell them, they won't.

253
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,849
I can't do it
anymore, Terence.

254
00:17:43,294 --> 00:17:45,524
Oh, fuck.

255
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:53,395
I'm-I'm really sorry.
I just can't.

256
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:55,803
Mundt,

257
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:59,037
whatever drugs might've
been taken out of the property room,

258
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:03,279
you will have a
voucher, you understand?

259
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:07,842
They won't turn up as missing,
'cause there's no record of them being there

260
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,355
in the first
place, okay?

261
00:18:11,422 --> 00:18:13,788
They're installing cameras.

262
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:18,753
So then you
don't do anything

263
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:23,199
where the cameras
can see you.

264
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,963
I can't.

265
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:28,233
When it was me doing
paperwork to cover the cash you misplaced,

266
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:31,275
that was all right.
That was entirely fucking reasonable.

267
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:33,242
I'm sorry.

268
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,373
Hey, Mundt.

269
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:39,914
Hey, Mundt?

270
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,430
[woman laughing]

271
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:17,112
[woman laughs]

272
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:23,186
You bad boy.

273
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,794
(woman)
Oh, yeah.

274
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,737
[moans]

275
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,831
Stand against the wall.

276
00:19:36,908 --> 00:19:40,139
Come on! Stand
against the wall.

277
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:42,145
You're too busy
making out with your girlfriend

278
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:44,147
you don't know
when you've done something illegal?

279
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:45,705
What are we
hiding tonight?

280
00:19:45,783 --> 00:19:46,841
Nothing.

281
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,818
You passed drugs
in that club?

282
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,684
No.

283
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:54,589
The two of you match a
description. Empty your pockets and the handbag.

284
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:55,887
Why?

285
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,928
I said you match
a description.

286
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,430
Somebody seen
passing drugs.

287
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:03,126
I wasn't passing drugs.
What does that even mean?

288
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:06,762
Empty your pockets.
Dump out the handbag. I'm not gonna tell you again.

289
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:09,204
This is bullshit!

290
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,708
Just do what
he says, okay?

291
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:13,437
What you got there?

292
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:15,172
Nothing.

293
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:17,339
I'm not gonna
get stuck, am l?

294
00:20:17,415 --> 00:20:18,780
No.

295
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,080
I get stuck, I'm
gonna be very fucking angry.

296
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:23,211
You're not
gonna get stuck.

297
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:26,519
Where's your badge
if you're a cop?

298
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,624
This is what
I'm looking for.

299
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:34,824
Here's where it
says I'm a cop.

300
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:39,336
Sir, it-it's obviously
just for personal use.

301
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,632
I mean,
I'm not a dealer.

302
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:43,333
That's for
the DA to decide.

303
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,536
You're gonna
dump that bag or I gotta do it?

304
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:53,211
Sir, is-is there any way
my parents don't have to find out about this?

305
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:55,809
I mean, can we,
can we just handle this?

306
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:59,084
I'll go to jail on weekends
or something like that if I have to do that.

307
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:02,524
My father has a
heart condition, okay?

308
00:21:04,195 --> 00:21:08,029
This would kill him.
Please. Just let me keep this from him.

309
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:10,363
You think he want
might to know?

310
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:14,929
Yeah. I'd wanna know
if you were my child.

311
00:21:18,676 --> 00:21:21,008
Here.

312
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:25,175
This fur is nothing,
but this is my grandmother's.

313
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:28,912
It's worth $60,000.

314
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,615
You can give it
to your girlfriend.

315
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:33,520
If You don't have
a girlfriend,

316
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:35,559
you can give it
to your mother.

317
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:37,218
It's bribery.

318
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:38,592
Excuse me!

319
00:21:38,663 --> 00:21:41,860
This is worth $60,000.

320
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:45,334
Doesn't that
get us passed?

321
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:47,667
Where's the rock?

322
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,572
Come on, come on,
who's got the kibble?

323
00:21:52,643 --> 00:21:53,632
You wanna hit?

324
00:21:53,711 --> 00:21:55,235
Yes.

325
00:22:11,696 --> 00:22:14,859
Jesus Christ.

326
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:16,422
Again.

327
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,366
Yeah?

328
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,836
[whispers]
Are you fucking kidding me?

329
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,879
[groans]

330
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:47,930
This what's
gonna take? Yeah?

331
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,490
You're worried about
your father finding out?

332
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:51,796
No.

333
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:53,166
What about your mother?

334
00:22:53,237 --> 00:22:55,603
I don't give a shit
about anyone of them.

335
00:22:55,673 --> 00:22:57,334
Did they beat you?

336
00:22:57,408 --> 00:22:58,875
No.

337
00:22:58,943 --> 00:23:00,604
Molest you?

338
00:23:00,678 --> 00:23:02,373
No.

339
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:05,280
Didn't buy you
any clothes back to school, huh?

340
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:09,445
Didn't see you in
the high school play, huh?

341
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,614
I wonder what'd they
say if they saw you now.

342
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,181
Smokin' crack.
[groans]

343
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:17,693
Going out with
no panties on?

344
00:23:17,762 --> 00:23:19,389
No pain?

345
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:22,365
[moans]

346
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:26,426
I bet they think about
you when you were a little girl.

347
00:23:26,504 --> 00:23:28,768
What the hell
happened to ya?

348
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:34,938
Don't fucking move!
You stay and watch!

349
00:23:35,012 --> 00:23:39,449
You watch her! Watch
your fucking girlfriend.

350
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:52,919
[train whistling]

351
00:23:52,997 --> 00:23:54,862
Fuck!

352
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:37,236
I need the coke back.

353
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:38,935
What happened?

354
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,002
I snorted what I thought
was coke. It turned out to be heroin.

355
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:43,512
I gotta be at
work in a hour.

356
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:45,776
Oh, baby, okay.
I'm not alone.

357
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,785
Just get the coke.
I'll get out of here.

358
00:25:00,965 --> 00:25:03,263
You didn't break it
out for your client?

359
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:05,234
Nah. He brings his own.

360
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,600
Uh-huh.

361
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,872
Who are you?

362
00:25:17,381 --> 00:25:21,249
I'm the last person
in the world you want me to be.

363
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,378
He's just
an old friend.

364
00:25:23,454 --> 00:25:27,891
Come on, missy,
we've had you under surveillance for weeks.

365
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,621
Do you have any illegal
substances on you?

366
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,287
Like what?

367
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:34,092
Asshole.

368
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:37,657
Cooperate with me,
I'll let you walk outta here.

369
00:25:37,735 --> 00:25:41,535
You play games,
come with her.

370
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:46,301
I got some coke.

371
00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:48,436
Get it.

372
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,515
Get out.

373
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:09,832
[laughs]

374
00:26:12,937 --> 00:26:14,837
That was fun.

375
00:26:14,905 --> 00:26:17,032
Hey.

376
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:18,473
[both laugh]

377
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,908
Come. Come!

378
00:26:57,281 --> 00:26:58,771
Are you a policeman?

379
00:26:58,849 --> 00:26:59,907
Yes.

380
00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:01,315
Do you know
who do this?

381
00:27:01,385 --> 00:27:02,477
I don't know, yet.

382
00:27:02,553 --> 00:27:03,850
Look here.

383
00:27:03,921 --> 00:27:06,116
This dead.
Babacar.

384
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,681
This little girl,
no more.

385
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:11,250
He's dead, dead.
Older man.

386
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:14,730
Oh, my angel,
she's dead. All my whole family.

387
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,426
How are you related?

388
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,367
Yasin. She were
my sister.

389
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,132
When was the last
time you saw her?

390
00:27:21,205 --> 00:27:24,800
I see her dat morning.
I go by in case she need anything.

391
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:28,333
But dat morning
she says she needs something from the grocery,

392
00:27:28,412 --> 00:27:32,872
and she called there
and had it delivered by a boy to her home.

393
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,713
Help me, please.

394
00:27:34,785 --> 00:27:38,152
Please, help me find
the killer of my family.

395
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:42,022
Please, sir.
Help me. Help.

396
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,042
Are you the manager?

397
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:05,082
No, sir.

398
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:07,242
The manager's
over there.

399
00:28:10,521 --> 00:28:13,649
New Orleans Homicide.
You got people making deliveries here?

400
00:28:13,724 --> 00:28:17,285
We get different guys making
deliveries. Different days, different guys.

401
00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:19,158
What about Tuesday?

402
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,221
Different times a day.
Different guys.

403
00:28:21,298 --> 00:28:22,629
Late afternoon.

404
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,863
We don't keep track
of who takes what to who.

405
00:28:25,936 --> 00:28:28,461
A delivery boy
hasn't shown up in a while?

406
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:57,363
Excuse us. Hello!

407
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,494
Police Department.

408
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,595
We're looking
for Binnie Rogers.

409
00:29:01,672 --> 00:29:03,435
I'm Binnie Rogers.

410
00:29:03,507 --> 00:29:07,170
We need to talk to you
for a second. Do you mind stepping in the hall?

411
00:29:07,244 --> 00:29:10,145
No, I can't step
into the hall.

412
00:29:10,214 --> 00:29:13,047
Can't you see this
lady needs me here?

413
00:29:15,052 --> 00:29:17,953
We're looking for your
grandson, Miss Rogers.

414
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,717
What are you
looking for him for?

415
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,917
Just to talk.
We just wanna talk to him.

416
00:29:21,992 --> 00:29:24,153
He do somethin' wrong?

417
00:29:24,228 --> 00:29:26,389
He might've been
a witness to a crime.

418
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,227
I don't know
anything about that.

419
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,096
Where can we find him?

420
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:35,070
Young man, what do you
think gives you the right to come into my room

421
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:40,338
and have a conversation
without even acknowledging my presence?

422
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,709
We're terribly sorry.

423
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:46,477
It's very important
we talk to this woman's grandson.

424
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,848
And she told you
she doesn't know where he is.

425
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:51,615
Actually, she hasn't
told us that.

426
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,884
I don't know.

427
00:29:57,127 --> 00:29:58,685
I'm sorry, Grandma.

428
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:06,702
What do you
wanna know?

429
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:11,264
Did you make a delivery
Tuesday on Josephine and Danneel, son?

430
00:30:13,944 --> 00:30:15,104
Uh-huh.

431
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:16,544
What did you see there?

432
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:18,946
This is a 15-year
old boy, sir.

433
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:21,177
We need you to tell us
what you saw, Daryl.

434
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:24,779
He don't get involved
in drugs, in gangs.

435
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:27,085
He go to school.

436
00:30:27,157 --> 00:30:29,557
He hold down a job
and he come home.

437
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,618
A family was
murdered, ma'am.

438
00:30:31,695 --> 00:30:33,959
And I feel very
bad about that.

439
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:37,432
But I don't want my
grandson involved in it.

440
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:40,902
Maybe your grandson has
some feelings of his own.

441
00:30:47,344 --> 00:30:48,868
Well,

442
00:30:50,514 --> 00:30:54,951
the lady told me
to set the grocery bags in the kitchen.

443
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:59,012
Uh, as I was setting
the grocery bags down, I heard screaming.

444
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:01,114
And I heard gunshots.

445
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:03,819
So I hid in the closet.

446
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:10,696
When I came out,
everybody was dead.

447
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:14,960
Did you see
who shot them?

448
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:27,082
Say yes or no.

449
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:38,691
This is who we're
looking for. Name is Donald Godshaw.

450
00:31:38,762 --> 00:31:42,459
Street name "Big Fate."
You should familiarize yourself with his record.

451
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:45,627
It goes back
to '91. Did time for rape, sodomy,

452
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:49,298
aggravated assault,
narcotics, and possession of automatic weapons.

453
00:31:49,373 --> 00:31:54,504
We believe he's also behind
at least three homicides including the Ndele family.

454
00:31:54,578 --> 00:31:57,103
Lieutenant, wanna show
some of those victims?

455
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:01,680
All three were
possible witnesses.

456
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,554
Godshaw has two flunkies
that he runs with.

457
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:07,614
Deshaun Hackett,
street name "Midget."

458
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:11,718
Has a girlfriend on Burgundy
and Mazant. We'll set up surveillance on the block.

459
00:32:11,795 --> 00:32:14,229
Maybe we'll get
lucky he'll turn up.

460
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:18,257
Gary Jenkins,
street name "G."

461
00:32:18,335 --> 00:32:20,963
His grandmother lives
in the Iberville Projects.

462
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:24,872
If his laying low
chances are, that's where we'll find him.

463
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:26,534
Let's bring him in.

464
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:49,460
Give me a minute.

465
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:01,643
I need access to the
apartment next door. Do you mind?

466
00:33:01,712 --> 00:33:04,772
Oh! It's okay, baby.
[laughs]

467
00:33:04,848 --> 00:33:06,440
Why you need
access for?

468
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:10,544
We had complaints
about disturbance, not answering the door.

469
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:21,358
[baby cries]

470
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:49,151
[dog barks]

471
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:36,137
Don't fucking breathe.

472
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:00,520
I love it.
[laughs]

473
00:35:00,597 --> 00:35:02,588
I just love it.

474
00:35:08,972 --> 00:35:11,634
I've told you
everything I know.

475
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,311
This is your
lucky day, son.

476
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:19,372
You're the first person
we've picked up. You're in a position to help yourself.

477
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:21,007
Help myself do what?

478
00:35:21,084 --> 00:35:23,484
You know something
about this family that got murdered.

479
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,613
I don't know nothing.

480
00:35:25,689 --> 00:35:29,625
You were in the apartment when
the Africans got shot. Who was with you? Midget Donald?

481
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:33,094
Donald Godshaw,
"Big Fate." Where is he? Where can we find him?

482
00:35:33,163 --> 00:35:34,721
I don't know
no "Big Fate."

483
00:35:34,798 --> 00:35:37,358
We don't need you no
more. There's gonna be five homicides

484
00:35:37,434 --> 00:35:38,992
and Donald's gonna
hand them on you.

485
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:41,936
He gets eight to ten.
You get for life.

486
00:35:42,005 --> 00:35:44,200
I don't know nobody
named "Midget".

487
00:35:44,274 --> 00:35:47,038
I don't know nobody
named "Big Fate."

488
00:35:57,654 --> 00:35:59,622
Renaldo Hayes!

489
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,853
Oh. Man!
That's bad luck.

490
00:36:02,926 --> 00:36:06,953
I keep hope that once
in a while this kid throws to somebody on his own team.

491
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:10,397
I love the guy. By the end
of the fucking game, I'm starting to hate him.

492
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:11,934
What do you want
for the weekend?

493
00:36:12,002 --> 00:36:13,867
What's the spread on
Louisiana-Arkansas?

494
00:36:13,937 --> 00:36:15,165
Four.

495
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,036
Louisiana.

496
00:36:17,107 --> 00:36:19,541
Minus to four
for a dime.

497
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,374
You got it. I got
a favor to ask.

498
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,277
My kid got
a speeding ticket.

499
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,908
I'll take care if you
give me half a point.

500
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,509
You're gonna grind me
for helping out my kid?

501
00:36:29,586 --> 00:36:31,679
Grind you?
You're funny guy, you know that?

502
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:35,452
There's guys getting half
a point on the street for nothing. Grind you.

503
00:36:38,428 --> 00:36:41,591
All right.
But you take care of it.

504
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,860
Hello. Hello!

505
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:14,727
I'm Lieutenant McDonagh,
New Orleans Homicide.

506
00:37:14,798 --> 00:37:16,288
What can I do for you?

507
00:37:16,366 --> 00:37:18,800
A friend of mine's daughter
got written up for speeding.

508
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:21,963
She was doing 75
on the way to the hospital to visit her grandmother.

509
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,974
Has a couple of minor,
minor violations in the past.

510
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:26,839
She's in danger
of losing her license.

511
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,275
What do you
want me to do?

512
00:37:28,345 --> 00:37:29,937
I'd like you to take
care of it for me.

513
00:37:30,013 --> 00:37:32,504
You come to the scene
of an accident to ask me that?

514
00:37:32,582 --> 00:37:34,311
There shouldn't
be a problem.

515
00:37:34,384 --> 00:37:38,480
Are you asking me to break
the law? Is that what you're doing here?

516
00:37:38,555 --> 00:37:42,753
I'm asking you
one cop to another to do me a favor.

517
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:46,026
The answer's no.

518
00:37:46,096 --> 00:37:47,757
Just like that?

519
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:49,321
Just like that.

520
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:52,891
Is this the same Police
Department my father was in?

521
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,301
You'll excuse me.

522
00:37:54,371 --> 00:37:55,770
Great.

523
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,104
Guardian of the Flame,
right? Fucking ass.

524
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:01,440
Get back in you
car, Lieutenant.

525
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:04,041
Or else what?

526
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:06,480
Hey there.

527
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,142
Hey, what are
you doing here?

528
00:38:08,218 --> 00:38:09,708
You know the Lieutenant?

529
00:38:09,786 --> 00:38:11,651
Yeah. We used
to work together.

530
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:14,452
Why don't you walk him
back to his car?

531
00:38:18,762 --> 00:38:21,356
I could've told you
not to bother with that asshole.

532
00:38:21,431 --> 00:38:23,831
You needed a ticket
fixed, why didn't you come to me?

533
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,492
I didn't know
you worked here.

534
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:28,402
They only let me out
on patrol when they're short handed.

535
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,906
Mostly they got me
in the property room.

536
00:38:30,974 --> 00:38:33,101
Property room?

537
00:38:33,176 --> 00:38:35,167
What are you
doing tonight?

538
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:38,780
You asking me out?

539
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:40,749
Yes, I am.

540
00:38:40,817 --> 00:38:43,377
[laughs]

541
00:39:39,342 --> 00:39:41,435
Hey.

542
00:39:44,514 --> 00:39:47,972
You like these
boots, don't you?

543
00:39:48,051 --> 00:39:50,884
Only on you,
you know that.

544
00:39:50,954 --> 00:39:52,922
Yeah?

545
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:54,513
You're horny?

546
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:57,992
Oh, yeah.

547
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:02,589
No, you're not.
You're high on dope.

548
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:05,897
Not true.

549
00:40:05,969 --> 00:40:09,166
Whatever I take
is prescription.

550
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:12,675
Except for the heroin.

551
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:16,671
Hey! Wake up, McDonagh.

552
00:40:18,515 --> 00:40:23,543
Yeah, there's times
I can't get what I need with the prescription.

553
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,485
Really?

554
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:29,924
Yeah. When my back
hurts sometimes.

555
00:40:29,993 --> 00:40:35,226
Well, maybe there's
something I can do to make that pain go away.

556
00:40:35,298 --> 00:40:37,766
You definitely can.

557
00:40:37,834 --> 00:40:40,530
What's that, baby?
What do you want me to do for you?

558
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,232
Check out your
property room

559
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:46,605
and see if there's
any Oxycontin

560
00:40:46,676 --> 00:40:48,940
or morphine

561
00:40:49,012 --> 00:40:53,244
you can sneak
outta there.

562
00:40:53,316 --> 00:40:57,412
Just make sure
you get rid of the voucher copy.

563
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,388
You're nuts.

564
00:41:19,342 --> 00:41:22,175
Hey.

565
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:25,442
The ticket's gonna be a
little more complicated than I thought.

566
00:41:25,515 --> 00:41:27,915
You're kidding me.

567
00:41:27,984 --> 00:41:30,782
The best thing to do
is to have her plead not guilty.

568
00:41:30,854 --> 00:41:34,813
By the time a court day
comes around, I'll talk to the cop who wrote her up.

569
00:41:34,891 --> 00:41:37,018
I thought that's what
you were gonna do.

570
00:41:37,093 --> 00:41:40,153
I went straight
to the Lieutenant.

571
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:43,222
He wound up being
a hard on.

572
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,360
It'll work out.
It's just gonna take a little longer. Come on.

573
00:41:46,436 --> 00:41:52,033
Kinda calls into question the
half-a-point-for-nothing concept, don't you think?

574
00:41:52,108 --> 00:41:54,099
You're some cheap
prick, you know that?

575
00:41:54,177 --> 00:41:56,975
You say you're gonna
do something and you don't do it.

576
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,345
Good! Charge me
for the half point.

577
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:04,683
And after last weekend,
you're down $3,000.

578
00:42:04,754 --> 00:42:08,417
You might,
I mean, might

579
00:42:08,491 --> 00:42:11,927
have thought to bring me
a little something.

580
00:42:13,496 --> 00:42:15,487
Two dimes!

581
00:42:15,565 --> 00:42:17,726
On Louisiana

582
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:20,031
against Georgia.

583
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:25,635
Okay, you got it.

584
00:42:39,155 --> 00:42:41,350
[flushes toilet]

585
00:43:08,518 --> 00:43:09,746
How long has he
been in there?

586
00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:11,013
About 20 minutes.

587
00:43:11,087 --> 00:43:12,611
Who else?

588
00:43:12,689 --> 00:43:15,522
His girlfriend.
At least one. That's as far as we know.

589
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:18,925
What are these fucking
iguanas doing on my coffee table?

590
00:43:18,995 --> 00:43:21,088
There ain't no iguana.

591
00:43:21,164 --> 00:43:22,529
Yeah, there are.

592
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:25,261
There ain't no iguana.

593
00:43:25,335 --> 00:43:27,667
What the fuck is that?
Fucking iguana.

594
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:31,067
Are we set up?

595
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:32,540
SWAT's around
the corner.

596
00:43:32,609 --> 00:43:35,737
No! No, just,
just no SWAT. Let them stay there.

597
00:43:35,812 --> 00:43:38,940
The duty captain said
he wanted to coordinate with us when we--

598
00:43:39,015 --> 00:43:42,746
Is that what you're fucking
doing now? Reporting back to the duty captain?

599
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:44,684
I'm telling you
what he said.

600
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:48,722
If we need SWAT,
we'll call 'em.

601
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,320
Let's go.

602
00:45:20,316 --> 00:45:21,408
Who else is in here?

603
00:45:21,484 --> 00:45:22,917
Nobody.

604
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,614
We're gonna come back
every day, you understand?

605
00:45:25,688 --> 00:45:31,092
More times we come back,
more chances that child getting shot.

606
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:32,958
Ain't nobody here.

607
00:45:33,029 --> 00:45:35,589
[whispers]
He's hiding back there in the armoire.

608
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:45,869
You all stay
with her. Armand.

609
00:46:01,991 --> 00:46:03,356
Get up.

610
00:46:03,426 --> 00:46:05,257
I said get up!

611
00:46:05,328 --> 00:46:07,091
Damn, man.

612
00:46:07,163 --> 00:46:11,065
It's always nice to see
an intact family.

613
00:46:11,134 --> 00:46:13,625
A father who honors
his obligations

614
00:46:13,703 --> 00:46:16,501
as far as his
children are a concern.

615
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:19,235
You're here.
That's important thing.

616
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:22,904
You may be hiding in
an armoire, but your child knows you're here.

617
00:46:22,979 --> 00:46:24,310
Are you tripping, man?

618
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,711
Armand, give us
a minute.

619
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,613
You're tripping.
You want that shit.

620
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:30,812
Shut the door.
Shut up. Shut the door.

621
00:46:32,455 --> 00:46:33,979
Sit down.

622
00:46:34,891 --> 00:46:36,756
Sit down, sit down.

623
00:46:39,128 --> 00:46:40,493
[exhales]

624
00:46:40,563 --> 00:46:42,554
Now we can talk.

625
00:46:44,767 --> 00:46:47,292
You don't mind
if I light one up, do you?

626
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:49,361
Fuck, man.

627
00:46:51,374 --> 00:46:53,899
I find it relaxes me.

628
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,775
What the fuck, man?

629
00:46:56,846 --> 00:47:01,010
You know we got
your boy, "G." Right?

630
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:03,416
Man, I don't know no "G."

631
00:47:04,854 --> 00:47:06,754
He knows you.

632
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,857
It's amazing how much
you can get done

633
00:47:10,927 --> 00:47:14,294
when you've got
a simple purpose guiding through life.

634
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,403
My purpose is
to find out

635
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:25,168
who shot up this
apartment on Josephine.

636
00:47:25,241 --> 00:47:28,301
I know the guy who
was living there was from Senegal.

637
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:30,346
I know he was
selling heroin.

638
00:47:30,413 --> 00:47:33,678
I know whose territory
he was stepping on.

639
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,947
And I know who went
over to the apartment to straighten him out.

640
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,854
I found out all that
in the past few days.

641
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,654
Where is
"Big Fate," son?

642
00:47:45,728 --> 00:47:48,322
I don't know
no "Big Fate."

643
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:50,389
You see, I know
that's not true.

644
00:47:50,466 --> 00:47:54,061
'Cause everybody who comes
from where you come, knows who "Big Fate" is.

645
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:57,265
The fact that you're lying
to me, tells me you're hiding something.

646
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:01,208
You know my only reason for
being here is to find out who shot up the apartment.

647
00:48:01,277 --> 00:48:04,246
I know that's what
you're hiding. See? It all,

648
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:08,774
all comes back
to that same simple purpose.

649
00:48:08,851 --> 00:48:13,311
Man, I ain't
telling you shit.

650
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:15,323
[dog barks]

651
00:48:32,308 --> 00:48:34,367
[dog barks]

652
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:36,469
Hey.

653
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,411
What's wrong?

654
00:48:38,481 --> 00:48:41,609
Your father's mad at me
'cause I can't take care of his fucking dog.

655
00:48:41,684 --> 00:48:43,447
Why does he need you
to take care of it?

656
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:46,352
'Cause he's going
back into AA.

657
00:48:46,422 --> 00:48:50,051
He says he can't
do with any more responsibilities.

658
00:48:50,126 --> 00:48:53,562
Besides that he,
he's gotta stop drinking.

659
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:57,430
I mean, ain't like
I don't wanna take care of it,

660
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:01,561
but I leave at 7:00
in the morning to go to work!

661
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:04,163
Oh, let me
talk to him.

662
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,505
I try to be a good
wife to him, Terence. I do. But you know,

663
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:09,807
I got a limit, too.

664
00:49:09,879 --> 00:49:14,543
You know, he's got a
drinking problem. He says he's got a drinking problem.

665
00:49:14,617 --> 00:49:17,381
He wants to so something
about it. That's good.

666
00:49:17,453 --> 00:49:21,719
You know, he's been
down this road before and it didn't take.

667
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:24,885
He wants to
try it again. Good!

668
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:29,591
But l, I say to him,
why don't you just take the beer the way that I do,

669
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:32,430
but he says
he can't do that.

670
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:34,402
Hey, Pop.

671
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:35,767
How are you doing?

672
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:37,829
I thought you said
the meeting was at seven.

673
00:49:37,907 --> 00:49:40,205
I gotta get there early.
Set up the chairs.

674
00:49:40,276 --> 00:49:41,265
I'll take you.

675
00:49:41,344 --> 00:49:42,936
She can do it.

676
00:49:43,012 --> 00:49:46,470
I came over to see you.
Let me take you for a ride, at least.

677
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:49,017
You feed the dog?

678
00:49:50,353 --> 00:49:51,718
You feed the dog?

679
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:53,688
I can take
care of him.

680
00:49:53,756 --> 00:49:56,281
What are you
talking about?

681
00:49:56,359 --> 00:49:59,192
Genevieve told me
a little about what's going on.

682
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:01,423
I'll take the dog
off your hands for a while.

683
00:50:01,497 --> 00:50:03,431
How are you gonna
take care of a dog?

684
00:50:03,499 --> 00:50:07,902
I got a friend.
She just loves animals. All of them. Dogs, too.

685
00:50:10,106 --> 00:50:12,040
Let's go.

686
00:50:12,108 --> 00:50:15,009
[dog barks]

687
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:22,117
Have a good time!

688
00:50:40,169 --> 00:50:42,603
No. No!

689
00:50:43,773 --> 00:50:46,264
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

690
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,846
Did we not discuss
this on the phone?

691
00:50:55,151 --> 00:50:58,018
How come you only
call me when you need something?

692
00:50:58,087 --> 00:50:59,611
You're fucked up,
aren't you?

693
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:02,089
What? Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fucked up.

694
00:51:02,158 --> 00:51:03,591
What are you doing?

695
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:05,820
I'm going to work.
I have to go to Biloxy tonight.

696
00:51:05,895 --> 00:51:07,624
Go to the hotel casino.

697
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:10,291
How are you gonna
take care of the dog if you're fucked up

698
00:51:10,366 --> 00:51:12,197
and you're going
to Biloxy?

699
00:51:12,268 --> 00:51:15,169
All right. The doorman's
gonna walk him in the morning

700
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,570
and I get back
in the afternoon.

701
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:21,098
Oh, he's sweet.
What's his name?

702
00:51:22,645 --> 00:51:24,476
I don't know.

703
00:51:25,915 --> 00:51:27,746
You don't know
his name?

704
00:51:27,817 --> 00:51:29,216
I'll ask my father.

705
00:51:29,285 --> 00:51:30,809
You are unbelievable.

706
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:32,582
I gotta get going.

707
00:51:32,655 --> 00:51:35,351
Unbelievable.
You don't know.

708
00:51:35,424 --> 00:51:37,392
Baby, be nice to me.

709
00:51:39,395 --> 00:51:43,889
He smells.
You need a bath.

710
00:51:43,966 --> 00:51:47,265
Try to understand.
It doesn't matter that you were just along for the ride.

711
00:51:47,336 --> 00:51:49,804
It doesn't matter that
you didn't actually shoot anybody.

712
00:51:49,872 --> 00:51:52,864
You're playing the prices now.
The price of "Big Fate" getting off,

713
00:51:52,942 --> 00:51:56,708
it's gonna help the DA
convict you and your boy "G. "

714
00:51:56,779 --> 00:51:59,543
I guarantee you that's
just what he's gonna do.

715
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,378
Why don't you
smoke, man?

716
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:02,883
What are you
talking about?

717
00:52:02,952 --> 00:52:05,716
I gotta listen
all this bullshit.

718
00:52:05,788 --> 00:52:07,119
Break out
to smoke, man.

719
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,748
Flipping out on us?

720
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:11,692
No, man.
Your partner lit up a motherfucker blunt

721
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:13,388
before he put
the cuffs on me.

722
00:52:13,462 --> 00:52:16,158
I love this guy.
[laughs]

723
00:52:16,232 --> 00:52:18,792
You say I smoked
marijuana in your presence? Huh?

724
00:52:18,868 --> 00:52:20,802
Cannabis? Is that
what you're saying?

725
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:23,202
Right. Your word
against mine,

726
00:52:23,272 --> 00:52:25,968
so they fuck won't
believe me, right?

727
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:28,203
(detective)
Lieutenant.

728
00:52:28,277 --> 00:52:31,610
Lieutenant, can you
step out for a moment?

729
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:52,196
My name is
Eugene Gratz, Lieutenant.

730
00:52:52,268 --> 00:52:56,568
I'm an attorney.
This is my client Donald Godshaw.

731
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:00,507
I understand you've
been looking for him.

732
00:53:00,576 --> 00:53:03,909
[Godshaw laughs]
How can I help you?

733
00:53:17,793 --> 00:53:20,227
I just wanna talk
to these guys for a second.

734
00:53:20,296 --> 00:53:22,389
Why don't you
wait there?

735
00:53:24,433 --> 00:53:26,128
Gentlemen.

736
00:53:30,139 --> 00:53:32,164
Can I get you
a glass of water?

737
00:53:32,241 --> 00:53:34,106
Um, no, thanks.

738
00:53:34,176 --> 00:53:39,011
I gotta turn over the
names of my witnesses to Godshaw's lawyer.

739
00:53:39,081 --> 00:53:42,539
As soon as I do that,
Godshaw will look to scare the kid.

740
00:53:42,618 --> 00:53:45,178
He can't scare him,
he'll kill him.

741
00:53:45,254 --> 00:53:46,516
He'll never get to him.

742
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:48,284
Since Godshaw
turned himself in,

743
00:53:48,357 --> 00:53:51,383
I've authorized
24-hour protection to start immediately.

744
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:54,054
Just remember,
we have no prints,

745
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,564
no DNA, no weapon.

746
00:53:56,632 --> 00:53:59,897
We lose the kid,
we lose the case.

747
00:53:59,969 --> 00:54:02,130
Understood?

748
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:06,073
[siren wailing]

749
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:13,579
He's a nice dogs.
I just can't keep him.

750
00:54:13,649 --> 00:54:16,243
She said she'd
be back at 1:00 this afternoon.

751
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,844
I'm off at 4:00,
and I got another job I gotta be at.

752
00:54:18,921 --> 00:54:20,411
She didn't call?

753
00:54:20,489 --> 00:54:22,184
No. And the night guy ain't
gonna go walk him.

754
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:25,091
I can't leave the animal
in her apartment. It might do damage.

755
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:26,594
How did you
get my number?

756
00:54:26,662 --> 00:54:29,722
Miss Frankie
gave it to me in case of emergencies.

757
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:31,858
Emergencies?

758
00:54:36,405 --> 00:54:39,306
This is what I'm talking
about. Doesn't pick up the phone.

759
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:45,143
She isn't where she's
supposed to be. Not showing up.

760
00:54:45,214 --> 00:54:49,514
Terence, think they're
gonna put me on the witness stand by May 15?

761
00:54:49,585 --> 00:54:51,416
Don't know, why?

762
00:54:51,487 --> 00:54:54,615
So my mom goes
for the parole board.

763
00:54:56,492 --> 00:54:59,791
I'm sure we can get
people to put in a good word for her.

764
00:54:59,862 --> 00:55:01,523
[cell phone rings]

765
00:55:01,597 --> 00:55:03,326
Hello?

766
00:55:03,399 --> 00:55:05,458
Where are you?

767
00:55:06,602 --> 00:55:10,060
I'm about an
hour from there.

768
00:55:10,139 --> 00:55:12,004
I'm on my way.

769
00:55:12,074 --> 00:55:15,043
Frankie, I'm on my way.

770
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:17,375
You ever been
to Biloxy?

771
00:56:12,468 --> 00:56:14,436
Now, you stand there.

772
00:56:14,503 --> 00:56:16,061
Don't move.

773
00:56:16,138 --> 00:56:18,834
I'll be back
in five minutes.

774
00:56:20,676 --> 00:56:21,734
Baby.

775
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:23,836
Hi, baby.
What are you doing?

776
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:24,971
You all right?

777
00:56:25,047 --> 00:56:27,277
Yeah.

778
00:56:28,584 --> 00:56:29,915
You okay?

779
00:56:29,985 --> 00:56:31,919
Yeah.

780
00:56:34,957 --> 00:56:36,754
Who did it?

781
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:39,795
Do you have
anything for me?

782
00:56:39,862 --> 00:56:41,386
Some coke.

783
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:42,829
That's it?

784
00:56:42,898 --> 00:56:44,456
And Vicodin.

785
00:56:44,533 --> 00:56:46,433
I'll take both.

786
00:56:50,606 --> 00:56:53,006
What the fuck is
going on in here?

787
00:56:56,612 --> 00:56:58,739
[door closes]

788
00:56:58,814 --> 00:57:00,111
Who's this?

789
00:57:00,182 --> 00:57:01,945
Hey, hey, hey!

790
00:57:02,017 --> 00:57:03,314
Take it easy.

791
00:57:03,385 --> 00:57:04,852
(Frankie)
Just get my money.

792
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,615
What are you,
jealous boyfriend?

793
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,054
Just get me
my money.

794
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:09,716
I'm using to paying
when I'm done.

795
00:57:09,792 --> 00:57:11,760
Done smacking her around?

796
00:57:11,827 --> 00:57:14,125
It was erotic shit, man.
I didn't hurt her.

797
00:57:15,397 --> 00:57:16,421
Didn't that hurt?

798
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:17,966
Did I hurt you?

799
00:57:18,033 --> 00:57:19,261
Terence, let's just go.

800
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:21,667
We don't hit
women down south.

801
00:57:21,737 --> 00:57:24,171
You just made
a big mistake.

802
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,368
My father is Andy Winnick,
you ever hear of him?

803
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:29,843
One of the biggest
developers in the gulf coast.

804
00:57:29,912 --> 00:57:31,174
Congratulations.

805
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:33,215
Tommy Leonardi is one
of his best friends.

806
00:57:33,282 --> 00:57:37,412
Listen, scumbag. Don't try
to impress me with you-father knows-some-guinea hood.

807
00:57:37,486 --> 00:57:41,582
What you gotta take away from
this experience is that if you ever see that girl again,

808
00:57:41,657 --> 00:57:45,024
you turn around
and you walk in the opposite direction. You got that?

809
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:46,118
Yeah, man.

810
00:57:46,195 --> 00:57:48,095
So much looking
at that girl,

811
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:51,031
you're gonna wish you
were born without a dick.

812
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:56,299
Oh! Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Oh, whoa.

813
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:59,899
Whoa. Big mistake.

814
00:57:59,975 --> 00:58:02,239
Oh, yeah.

815
00:58:02,311 --> 00:58:04,802
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

816
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,407
Big mistake.

817
00:58:09,852 --> 00:58:14,312
[laughs]

818
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:18,451
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

819
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:22,389
[whispers]
Whoa.

820
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,927
Oh, yeah.

821
00:58:30,272 --> 00:58:34,072
Daryl, this is Frankie.
Frankie, Daryl.

822
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:36,611
Hi, Daryl.

823
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,340
Hi.

824
00:58:54,496 --> 00:58:56,896
I gotta go talk
to someone.

825
00:58:56,966 --> 00:59:00,697
You go ahead
and take Frankie to the coffee shop.

826
00:59:00,769 --> 00:59:03,465
And you stay with her.
You can do that, right?

827
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:04,699
Yeah.

828
00:59:04,773 --> 00:59:06,240
Do you have
to do that now?

829
00:59:06,308 --> 00:59:08,173
I'll be with you
in a minute.

830
00:59:09,678 --> 00:59:12,044
Let's go?
Take care of me.

831
00:59:17,686 --> 00:59:19,483
How'd Louisiana
go off that?

832
00:59:19,555 --> 00:59:21,284
Three-point underdogs.

833
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:23,723
Three-point underdogs.
What are they losing by?

834
00:59:23,792 --> 00:59:25,282
Eight.

835
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:27,022
Eight? What
the fuck is that?

836
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:29,087
There's still two
minutes left to play.

837
00:59:31,066 --> 00:59:33,557
Louisiana ain't got
this passing game.

838
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:35,001
Good point.

839
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:38,198
You wanna get my picks
for the Pac-10?

840
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:40,333
Do I look like
I wanna hear 'em?

841
00:59:55,724 --> 00:59:57,487
Where is the kid?

842
00:59:57,559 --> 01:00:00,050
He went to the bathroom.

843
01:00:38,934 --> 01:00:42,028
Hi. Are there any
other bathrooms beside that one?

844
01:00:42,104 --> 01:00:44,265
Yeah, on the other side.

845
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:57,915
[voice from machine]
Hey, man, insert more coins.

846
01:00:57,986 --> 01:00:59,954
Insert more coins.

847
01:01:01,023 --> 01:01:02,957
Insert more coins.

848
01:01:06,862 --> 01:01:09,956
Insert more coins.
Play again.

849
01:01:11,867 --> 01:01:13,858
Insert more coins.

850
01:01:17,606 --> 01:01:19,267
Insert more coins.

851
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:23,477
What's going on?

852
01:01:23,545 --> 01:01:25,206
What did he say
when he left?

853
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,680
He asked me if I'd be
okay waiting here by myself.

854
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,514
I said yeah. He said he
had to go to the bathroom. What is going on?

855
01:01:30,586 --> 01:01:32,178
He's a witness
to a homicide.

856
01:01:32,254 --> 01:01:33,278
To what?

857
01:01:33,355 --> 01:01:34,822
To five homicides.
Let's go.

858
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:35,948
Where are we going?

859
01:01:36,024 --> 01:01:37,514
To find him.

860
01:03:03,745 --> 01:03:05,474
Where is he?

861
01:03:05,547 --> 01:03:07,606
Binnie, call security.

862
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:09,810
Nobody's calling anybody.

863
01:03:09,885 --> 01:03:11,443
Where's your
grandson, Binnie?

864
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,080
I don't have
to tell you anything.

865
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,391
Yeah, you do.

866
01:03:20,462 --> 01:03:24,023
I haven't done anything.
My grandson hasn't done anything.

867
01:03:24,099 --> 01:03:27,660
If he doesn't wanna be
a witness, he doesn't have to be a witness.

868
01:03:27,736 --> 01:03:30,398
This is bigger
than one, two.

869
01:03:30,472 --> 01:03:32,372
This was a massacre.

870
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:33,703
Children

871
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:37,210
were executed.

872
01:03:37,279 --> 01:03:40,305
Maybe you should've
thought of that before.

873
01:03:44,019 --> 01:03:46,783
I need to know
where he is.

874
01:03:46,855 --> 01:03:51,792
Young man, I would like
to know the name of your superior.

875
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:58,265
Right now I'm working
on about an hour and a half sleep

876
01:03:58,333 --> 01:04:00,324
over the past
three days.

877
01:04:00,402 --> 01:04:05,066
And I'm still trying
to remain courteous.

878
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:10,077
And I'm beginning to think
that that's getting in the way of my being effective.

879
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:20,411
What are you doing?

880
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:27,219
What--what
are you doing?

881
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:29,924
I wanna know

882
01:04:29,998 --> 01:04:32,296
where Daryl is.

883
01:04:32,367 --> 01:04:33,698
My God.

884
01:04:33,769 --> 01:04:36,465
Nobody saw me
come in. Nobody knows I'm here.

885
01:04:36,538 --> 01:04:38,631
This old woman's
gonna run out of air,

886
01:04:38,707 --> 01:04:42,268
and you're gonna have
a tough time convincing people that it wasn't you

887
01:04:42,344 --> 01:04:47,145
who did it to her.
And even if, and even if you do convince them

888
01:04:47,215 --> 01:04:50,343
that you didn't
kill her on purpose,

889
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:53,320
you're still gonna have
a tough time selling them that you

890
01:04:53,388 --> 01:04:56,448
took care of her
with a fuck!

891
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:58,117
Now, listen to me.

892
01:04:58,193 --> 01:05:00,957
Where the fuck is he?

893
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:04,325
I said where
the fuck is he?

894
01:05:04,399 --> 01:05:06,993
He's on an airplane.

895
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,560
Miss Antoinette
bought him a ticket

896
01:05:09,638 --> 01:05:13,301
and send him to live
with her family in England.

897
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:17,745
[whimpers]

898
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:21,305
All right, it's okay.
That's okay. That's a good girl. Suck it up.

899
01:05:21,383 --> 01:05:24,648
There you go. That's it.
Take it in. That's a good girl. Take it in.

900
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,655
Good! Good.

901
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:29,350
Good.

902
01:05:29,424 --> 01:05:31,483
That's it. Breathe.

903
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,188
Maybe you should drop
dead, you selfish cunt.

904
01:05:34,262 --> 01:05:38,562
You ever think
about your kids or your grandkids? Huh?

905
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:42,730
Sucking up their inheritance
through that fucked oxygen tube?

906
01:05:42,804 --> 01:05:45,329
And Binnie's fucked
intensive care?

907
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:49,042
You fucks, I hate you.
I hate you both.

908
01:05:51,179 --> 01:05:53,340
I should, I should
fucking both, right now,

909
01:05:53,415 --> 01:05:55,940
I should fucking
kill you fucking both.

910
01:05:57,919 --> 01:06:01,753
You're the fucking reason
this country's going down the drain.

911
01:06:18,373 --> 01:06:21,536
Watch out. He's not
in a good mood.

912
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:24,473
Come in.

913
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,475
Have a seat.

914
01:06:29,551 --> 01:06:32,418
Scotland Yard called.
The kid's in England.

915
01:06:32,487 --> 01:06:36,321
Make him a material witness.
Maybe Scotland Yard will hold him.

916
01:06:36,391 --> 01:06:39,588
Can't do that. He had no
involvement with the crime.

917
01:06:39,661 --> 01:06:41,891
He don't want testify,
we can't compel him.

918
01:06:41,963 --> 01:06:44,261
Well, we could still
try flipping one of the three.

919
01:06:44,332 --> 01:06:46,129
You can try
all what you want.

920
01:06:46,201 --> 01:06:49,227
Nobody flipping
on Godshaw. They're scared to death of him.

921
01:06:49,304 --> 01:06:52,398
As of now, all are
persons of interest.

922
01:06:52,474 --> 01:06:54,032
You gotta let him go.

923
01:06:54,109 --> 01:06:57,010
Oh, come on!
Five homicides and you're letting him go?

924
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:59,741
You weren't supposed to let
the kid out of your sight.

925
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:01,442
Be glad he didn't
turn out dead.

926
01:07:01,516 --> 01:07:02,448
This is bullshit.

927
01:07:02,517 --> 01:07:03,711
Get the hell outta here.

928
01:07:03,785 --> 01:07:05,377
You're not the one
on the street--

929
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:07,183
Get out of my office.

930
01:07:07,255 --> 01:07:10,122
Risking our lives
on the street!

931
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:13,355
You know what's
involved, right?

932
01:07:13,428 --> 01:07:18,889
Maybe if we get a prosecutor
worry about something, we could stand a fucking chance.

933
01:07:29,511 --> 01:07:32,036
What happened when
you went to see the grandmother?

934
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:34,207
I told you.

935
01:07:34,282 --> 01:07:38,116
She said the woman she takes
care of, bought a plane ticket. He was on his way to England

936
01:07:38,186 --> 01:07:39,676
to stay with
her relatives.

937
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:41,484
Any incidents took
place over there?

938
01:07:41,556 --> 01:07:43,023
What kind of incidents?

939
01:07:43,091 --> 01:07:44,319
Any kind.

940
01:07:44,392 --> 01:07:45,757
No.

941
01:07:47,262 --> 01:07:51,426
Whatever it is,
you're gonna have your story down.

942
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:54,196
Public Integrity is
waiting for you back at the house.

943
01:07:54,269 --> 01:07:56,362
Oh, come on. Public
Integrity into this?

944
01:07:56,438 --> 01:07:57,928
What for?

945
01:07:58,006 --> 01:08:02,534
That old woman,
her son is a United States congressman.

946
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:08,545
I asked where
Daryl was.

947
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:11,780
His grandmother told me.

948
01:08:11,853 --> 01:08:16,654
You didn't, at any time,
threaten his grandmother?

949
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:20,559
No, I did not.

950
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:23,928
You didn't, at
any time, threaten Antoinette Fahringer?

951
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:25,762
No, I did not.

952
01:08:25,834 --> 01:08:29,668
You should know a formal
complaint's been filed alleging you cut off

953
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:32,332
Mrs. Fahringer's
oxygen supply.

954
01:08:32,407 --> 01:08:35,501
Who's saying that?
Mrs. Fahringer?

955
01:08:35,577 --> 01:08:37,135
Is it true?

956
01:08:37,212 --> 01:08:39,908
I think she might
be suffering from a little dementia.

957
01:08:39,981 --> 01:08:42,279
Lieutenant, we're
asking if it's true.

958
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:45,251
Absolutely not.

959
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:54,625
Lieutenant.

960
01:08:56,364 --> 01:09:00,357
You know, I saw five
of those driving into work this morning.

961
01:09:00,435 --> 01:09:03,563
I want you
to clean it up. Clean it up.

962
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,700
Ned, excellent.
You got my message. Good. Come on.

963
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:10,005
What message?

964
01:09:10,078 --> 01:09:11,875
You get the flowers
I sent? How's Jenny?

965
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:13,847
What the fuck are
you talking about?

966
01:09:13,915 --> 01:09:15,405
Okay, that's good.

967
01:09:15,483 --> 01:09:16,507
Stop it!
Cut it out.

968
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:17,813
What are you
doing here?

969
01:09:17,886 --> 01:09:19,410
What do you think?

970
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,011
I don't have
anything for you.

971
01:09:21,089 --> 01:09:22,386
Then this is
a problem.

972
01:09:22,457 --> 01:09:24,118
Yeah, who
needs a problem?

973
01:09:24,192 --> 01:09:27,628
You owe me
five large, Terence.

974
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:29,220
I haven't got it.

975
01:09:29,297 --> 01:09:31,492
Then, you gotta
give me something.

976
01:09:31,566 --> 01:09:35,627
Give me goods if
you don't have cash. Give me a gold Rolex.

977
01:09:35,704 --> 01:09:37,899
Ned, I look like
I got a gold Rolex?

978
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:40,567
Don't pine me for
a fucking stooge.

979
01:09:40,642 --> 01:09:42,906
Keep your voice down.
Just keep it down.

980
01:09:42,978 --> 01:09:46,573
Don't play me
for a fucking stooge.

981
01:09:46,648 --> 01:09:48,309
Are you done?

982
01:09:48,383 --> 01:09:51,841
Do you think these guys
care you're a cop? They will fuck you up

983
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,751
just like
everybody else.

984
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:55,881
Let me get something
down with the Texas game.

985
01:09:55,957 --> 01:09:58,152
'Cause that's where
the season turns a lot.

986
01:09:58,226 --> 01:10:00,319
No.

987
01:10:00,395 --> 01:10:05,355
Nothing. You pay
what the fuck you owe.

988
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:12,965
I'm a little late on
my rent, that's all.

989
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:15,441
Lieutenant.

990
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:20,038
Uh, somebody named
Frankie called.

991
01:10:47,108 --> 01:10:48,405
What's going on?

992
01:10:48,476 --> 01:10:51,934
All kinds of things.
Come closer. I'm Dave.

993
01:10:52,013 --> 01:10:53,139
Who are you?

994
01:10:53,214 --> 01:10:54,272
Andy.

995
01:10:54,349 --> 01:10:55,577
Jeff.

996
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:57,413
What do you want?

997
01:10:57,485 --> 01:11:01,512
What I want right now
is to get this behind position right.

998
01:11:01,589 --> 01:11:02,886
He wants money.

999
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,619
Who are you?

1000
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:08,322
Sit down.
I told you, I'm Dave.

1001
01:11:08,396 --> 01:11:12,389
And the guy you robbed,
I know told you he was.

1002
01:11:12,467 --> 01:11:15,436
You make a date
with a pretty girl. You gotta pay.

1003
01:11:17,272 --> 01:11:20,139
Dear. Like this.

1004
01:11:20,208 --> 01:11:26,010
You want the schwantz,
not the prosty. See? That's it.

1005
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:30,040
When you engage with
another human being, we remind ourselves we're not alone.

1006
01:11:30,118 --> 01:11:32,951
Plus, who knows,
maybe we even learn a little something.

1007
01:11:33,021 --> 01:11:34,648
How much?

1008
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:37,783
You took 10 off.
To make it right, you gotta come up with 50.

1009
01:11:37,859 --> 01:11:39,349
No, that's bullshit.

1010
01:11:39,427 --> 01:11:41,793
No, it's punitive
damages. What can I tell you?

1011
01:11:41,863 --> 01:11:44,058
I don't get it.
She kept up with the bargain.

1012
01:11:44,132 --> 01:11:45,656
He says no.

1013
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:48,362
He's a fucking liar.
I did everything he asked me to do.

1014
01:11:48,436 --> 01:11:50,165
Which was what?

1015
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:52,638
(Frankie)
You want details?

1016
01:11:52,707 --> 01:11:54,868
You sick people.

1017
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:59,175
Oh, listen to her
stand up for herself. The indignation.

1018
01:11:59,247 --> 01:12:00,680
I love it.

1019
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:02,114
Where's the money?

1020
01:12:02,183 --> 01:12:04,310
In my bag.

1021
01:12:07,655 --> 01:12:09,452
It's all here?

1022
01:12:09,524 --> 01:12:12,823
Okay. Here are
five thousand.

1023
01:12:12,894 --> 01:12:14,486
There's ten
in change here.

1024
01:12:14,562 --> 01:12:16,860
Why don't I give you
this, call a day.

1025
01:12:16,931 --> 01:12:21,994
We could do that.
Alternatively, I could tell Jeffy to shoot the dog.

1026
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:25,096
Do you want me
to shoot the fucking dog?

1027
01:12:27,075 --> 01:12:30,272
Or put my calling card
on this gorgeous punum here.

1028
01:12:30,345 --> 01:12:32,210
I don't give a shit
about the dog.

1029
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:35,647
But you mark her up,
I'm gonna have a tough time getting you your money.

1030
01:12:35,717 --> 01:12:37,378
By my money you
mean $50,000.

1031
01:12:37,452 --> 01:12:38,783
I'll need a
couple of days.

1032
01:12:38,853 --> 01:12:40,582
By a couple
you mean two.

1033
01:12:40,655 --> 01:12:41,883
Yeah.

1034
01:12:41,956 --> 01:12:43,514
Good.

1035
01:12:43,591 --> 01:12:45,058
[whispers]
Hey.

1036
01:12:45,126 --> 01:12:47,754
I know. Relax.

1037
01:12:47,829 --> 01:12:51,526
The boys wanna saddle her
up just in the spirit of friendliness.

1038
01:12:51,599 --> 01:12:53,089
You mind?

1039
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:56,296
Well, let her get
cleaned up, put on something hot.

1040
01:12:56,371 --> 01:12:58,305
She looks like
shit right now.

1041
01:12:58,373 --> 01:12:59,533
Beautiful.

1042
01:12:59,607 --> 01:13:01,472
What are you
waiting for?

1043
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:06,344
I don't wanna put
any pressure on you,

1044
01:13:06,414 --> 01:13:09,247
but she has a client
coming over in 15 minutes.

1045
01:13:09,317 --> 01:13:11,012
You boys can be
done by the, right?

1046
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:12,883
The both of us?

1047
01:13:12,954 --> 01:13:16,014
They'd had been done
in 15 seconds you hadn't mentioned it.

1048
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:17,388
My mistake.

1049
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:19,484
You'll hit her
when we come back.

1050
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:22,155
Two days, same time,
same station, yes?

1051
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:24,130
Okay. You got it, baby.

1052
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:26,861
Don't make me look
for you, Terence.

1053
01:13:59,901 --> 01:14:01,994
They're gone.

1054
01:14:05,006 --> 01:14:08,066
I'm gonna take you
to my father's house.

1055
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:10,668
Buy some time at least.

1056
01:14:12,413 --> 01:14:14,347
Frankie.

1057
01:14:15,583 --> 01:14:17,175
They're gone.

1058
01:14:25,059 --> 01:14:26,390
I can't take her.

1059
01:14:26,594 --> 01:14:30,086
I just need a place
where she can stay for a couple of days.

1060
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:32,497
Why can't you put her
up in your place?

1061
01:14:32,567 --> 01:14:36,025
I can't take a chance
these guys find out where I live, Dad.

1062
01:14:36,104 --> 01:14:39,073
Christ!

1063
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:41,836
They gave me the job
of bringing cookies to a meeting.

1064
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:44,037
It takes me half
a day to get it done.

1065
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:46,307
You want me to
baby-sit a pros?

1066
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:48,144
You don't have
to baby-sit her.

1067
01:14:48,216 --> 01:14:50,275
She's very
self-suficient.

1068
01:14:50,351 --> 01:14:55,220
Well, I'm not in any kind
of shape to take on something like this.

1069
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:57,690
Look, I get home
from one meeting.

1070
01:14:57,759 --> 01:15:01,957
I lie on the couch
and I wait till it's time for the next meeting.

1071
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:04,157
That's all l
can do right now.

1072
01:15:04,232 --> 01:15:06,427
Let your wife
deal with her.

1073
01:15:06,501 --> 01:15:08,833
They'll get along
like sisters.

1074
01:15:08,903 --> 01:15:11,394
Get away from me, you rag.

1075
01:15:11,472 --> 01:15:13,804
[grunting]

1076
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:17,675
My husband is trying to quit
drinking and you bring this shit into our house?

1077
01:15:17,745 --> 01:15:21,010
Give it back or I'll swear
to God I will stab you in the heart.

1078
01:15:21,082 --> 01:15:23,380
I will stab you
in the heart.

1079
01:15:23,451 --> 01:15:25,646
What kind of trash
you're bringing in here?

1080
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:28,484
She's going
through my bag! My personal shit!

1081
01:15:28,556 --> 01:15:29,989
Everybody calm down.

1082
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:31,753
It's hard enough
for your father.

1083
01:15:31,826 --> 01:15:34,522
He's gotta put up
with narcotics under his nose.

1084
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:39,056
Oh, God. It can't be any
worse than you being shit face on beer all the time.

1085
01:15:39,133 --> 01:15:41,158
Enough!

1086
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:43,704
You tell her I'm
shit face all the time?

1087
01:15:43,771 --> 01:15:46,205
Oh, it's pretty
fucking obvious, lady!

1088
01:15:46,274 --> 01:15:49,266
Oh, yeah?
You fucking whore.

1089
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:53,007
Watch this.
Come get it. Come fucking get it.

1090
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:56,608
Get her outta here.
I can't deal with this shit.

1091
01:15:56,684 --> 01:15:58,549
You cunt.

1092
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:00,212
Hey, the neighbors!

1093
01:16:00,288 --> 01:16:02,222
You're a cunt,
you whore.

1094
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:04,724
I'll fuck you up.

1095
01:16:04,792 --> 01:16:07,955
We come in
or you come out?

1096
01:16:08,029 --> 01:16:10,964
Alright, come on,
let's go.

1097
01:16:11,032 --> 01:16:14,627
So, uh,
Francesca Donnenfeld. Do you know her?

1098
01:16:14,702 --> 01:16:18,001
Just cut the bullshit,
Yasco, and tell me what you're here for.

1099
01:16:18,072 --> 01:16:19,835
I'm Yasco.

1100
01:16:19,907 --> 01:16:23,138
Here's the thing, tough
guy. You keep fucking with the wrong people.

1101
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:26,203
First the old lady,
now your prostitute friend's customer.

1102
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:30,240
The old lady, you might've
written out. She, uh, doesn't remember so good.

1103
01:16:30,318 --> 01:16:33,879
The colored nurse,
she's covering for the grandson, whatever.

1104
01:16:33,955 --> 01:16:36,753
But why I get a call
from the chief D's office

1105
01:16:36,824 --> 01:16:39,816
that you've
shaken down your pros friend's customer

1106
01:16:39,894 --> 01:16:44,831
whose father's hung all
the way from here to fucking City Hall.

1107
01:16:44,899 --> 01:16:47,129
You're done, Lieutenant.

1108
01:16:47,201 --> 01:16:48,725
What do you want?

1109
01:16:48,803 --> 01:16:50,930
Your gun, for starters.

1110
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:53,669
Come on.

1111
01:17:01,182 --> 01:17:02,877
Until the outcome
of the hearing,

1112
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:05,009
you're on modify duty.

1113
01:17:05,086 --> 01:17:08,613
Better call your
delegate. You got an ass kicking coming.

1114
01:17:10,491 --> 01:17:12,721
You have a good
day, Lieutenant.

1115
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:18,962
[jumbled voices]

1116
01:17:25,106 --> 01:17:28,542
A man without a
gun is not a man.

1117
01:17:28,609 --> 01:17:31,635
Oh, well, I know.
Look, you cut the best deal you can

1118
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:35,274
and you get the hell out
of the Police Department. 'Cause if you stay in,

1119
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,284
it's gonna get worse.

1120
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:39,650
Can I talk to you
for a second?

1121
01:17:39,721 --> 01:17:43,851
I can't stay here.
I didn't take this shit from my own mother

1122
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:45,688
and I'm not gonna
take it from her.

1123
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,753
Can I get a minute alone
with my girlfriend?

1124
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:53,790
Just give her a day or two.
She's gonna calm down, I promise.

1125
01:17:53,868 --> 01:17:57,326
I'm so, I'm so happy
you're here.

1126
01:17:57,405 --> 01:18:01,307
And I got something
else somewhere. I'll show you.

1127
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:04,106
She's really mean.

1128
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:24,560
I wanna show you
this place.

1129
01:18:25,633 --> 01:18:28,864
I spent a lot
of time here

1130
01:18:28,936 --> 01:18:31,200
when I was a boy.

1131
01:18:31,272 --> 01:18:33,137
That doesn't
work anymore.

1132
01:18:33,207 --> 01:18:36,040
I was here
alone a lot.

1133
01:18:37,445 --> 01:18:41,176
This was my
special place

1134
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:42,807
as a child.

1135
01:18:44,085 --> 01:18:47,179
My, my castle.

1136
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:51,817
And I would imagine
things here. Pirates, a buried treasure.

1137
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:56,853
And my dad didn't
like that so much, but my mom, she, she got it.

1138
01:18:56,931 --> 01:18:59,798
And, uh, and
before she died,

1139
01:18:59,867 --> 01:19:03,860
she bought me a metal
detector. Come on, let me show you something.

1140
01:19:03,938 --> 01:19:06,338
Look at that.
Right out there,

1141
01:19:06,407 --> 01:19:11,367
I thought that pirates
came up the Mississippi

1142
01:19:11,446 --> 01:19:16,213
and that they buried
a treasure right there by that tree next to the house.

1143
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:19,845
So l, I took the
metal detector my mom gave me

1144
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:22,515
and I went out there
waiting it would start beeping.

1145
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:25,184
It was like beep-beep,
beep, beep, beep.

1146
01:19:25,259 --> 01:19:28,888
And I started digging,
and l-l-I dug and I dug and I dug,

1147
01:19:28,963 --> 01:19:34,663
and I found a, a
Sterling silver spoon, and I was so happy.

1148
01:19:34,735 --> 01:19:38,136
I started screaming
and jumping and laughing.

1149
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:40,868
And I went, "Hey, man,
this is treasure.

1150
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:44,742
This is pirate treasure."
And I came back in here with it.

1151
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:49,716
And I hid it somewhere,
this Sterling silver spoon.

1152
01:19:49,784 --> 01:19:51,809
I still can't find it.

1153
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,785
It could be anywhere.

1154
01:19:56,691 --> 01:19:59,023
I-I know it's here.

1155
01:20:10,605 --> 01:20:12,835
I don't know what
to tell you, Terence.

1156
01:20:12,907 --> 01:20:15,000
Not a lot I can do
under the circumstances.

1157
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:17,237
I know.

1158
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:23,581
I tell you guys all the time,
you cannot get away with that cowboy shit anymore.

1159
01:20:23,651 --> 01:20:27,610
You don't listen,
now this is where were at.

1160
01:20:27,688 --> 01:20:31,522
My best fucking detective,
I gotta put him in the property room.

1161
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:01,284
Terence, come on.

1162
01:21:01,355 --> 01:21:04,051
Man, l-I don't wanna
you get jammed off for all of this.

1163
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:08,391
You're doing all this wrong
shit and I'm here. They're gonna think I'm doing it, too.

1164
01:21:08,462 --> 01:21:12,125
So, go to the store
warehouse in Metairie that way you're not here.

1165
01:21:12,199 --> 01:21:16,226
And while you're there,
get me my.45 Magnum and bring it to me. Okay?

1166
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:24,876
Hey.

1167
01:21:24,946 --> 01:21:26,641
You're working here?

1168
01:21:26,714 --> 01:21:29,080
Looks like.
What you got there?

1169
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:32,916
Nine, ten grams
of heroin and a Glock nine.

1170
01:21:32,987 --> 01:21:36,354
Yeah. You see that
scale over there?

1171
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:37,948
It's broken.

1172
01:21:38,859 --> 01:21:41,054
See? useless.

1173
01:21:41,128 --> 01:21:42,925
I sent for a new one.

1174
01:21:42,997 --> 01:21:46,023
As soon as it gets here,
I'll weigh the drugs

1175
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:48,000
and I'll get you
your voucher, okay?

1176
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:49,434
All right, bye-bye.

1177
01:21:58,379 --> 01:22:00,847
Can I help you, sir?
Can I help you, sir?

1178
01:22:00,915 --> 01:22:04,282
[jumbled voices]

1179
01:22:04,352 --> 01:22:06,320
[laughter]

1180
01:22:06,387 --> 01:22:08,252
Can I talk
to you a minute?

1181
01:22:08,322 --> 01:22:09,687
Excuse me?

1182
01:22:09,757 --> 01:22:12,351
Mind stepping outside?
I'd like to talk to you.

1183
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:17,062
You interrupted my meal.

1184
01:22:17,131 --> 01:22:20,999
I'm gonna pretend to be polite,
so you look a big man in front of your friends.

1185
01:22:21,068 --> 01:22:23,628
You give me a hard time,
I'll put the cuffs on you

1186
01:22:23,704 --> 01:22:25,968
just like any
other shitbird.

1187
01:22:28,809 --> 01:22:30,106
I'll be back.

1188
01:22:30,177 --> 01:22:31,235
You a'ight?

1189
01:22:31,312 --> 01:22:32,870
Motherfucker wanna
talk to me.

1190
01:22:32,947 --> 01:22:35,677
You ain't gonna shoot me,
are you, motherfucker?

1191
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,775
Why would I do that?

1192
01:22:44,925 --> 01:22:47,393
I got something for you
I think you're gonna like.

1193
01:22:47,461 --> 01:22:48,826
Let's take a walk.

1194
01:22:58,072 --> 01:23:00,540
Be crazy for
coming down here.

1195
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:06,075
I'm gonna give you a chance
to make some money the old fashion way

1196
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:08,274
with a cop protecting you.

1197
01:23:08,349 --> 01:23:09,839
What I need
protection from?

1198
01:23:09,917 --> 01:23:11,407
The cops.

1199
01:23:11,485 --> 01:23:15,546
[laughs]
A cop will protect me from cops?

1200
01:23:15,623 --> 01:23:18,217
You'll know when a supplier
is under surveillance.

1201
01:23:18,292 --> 01:23:21,318
You'll know when it's
safe to make a pick up, when it's not.

1202
01:23:21,395 --> 01:23:22,692
What I gotta give you?

1203
01:23:22,763 --> 01:23:24,560
Fifteen thousand
a shipment.

1204
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:26,793
Oh, I'm sorry,
am I being unfair?

1205
01:23:28,135 --> 01:23:30,296
How I know you ain't
looking to set me up?

1206
01:23:30,371 --> 01:23:33,568
Tomorrow I'll bring you
some information. Small shit.

1207
01:23:33,641 --> 01:23:36,405
You decide if you wanna
go to the next step.

1208
01:23:38,379 --> 01:23:41,940
What about the murders?
You don't give the fuck about them no more?

1209
01:23:42,016 --> 01:23:45,213
Look at me.
Now look at you.

1210
01:23:45,286 --> 01:23:47,015
I never did.

1211
01:24:21,422 --> 01:24:24,050
Hey, I got the weight
on that dope finally.

1212
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:25,490
Thanks.

1213
01:24:29,396 --> 01:24:31,387
That's all there was?

1214
01:24:31,465 --> 01:24:33,831
I'll double check it
if you want.

1215
01:24:37,905 --> 01:24:40,601
Don't matter.
Still got enough for felony.

1216
01:24:40,674 --> 01:24:42,733
What are you guys
got going on today?

1217
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:46,746
Buying bust on Fourth
and Ferret on Andre's outfit.

1218
01:24:46,814 --> 01:24:48,873
Happy hunting.

1219
01:24:55,122 --> 01:24:58,285
[cell phone rings]

1220
01:25:00,494 --> 01:25:05,090
Undercover just busted
one on Andre's. Fourth and Ferret.

1221
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:07,930
What do you know?

1222
01:25:08,002 --> 01:25:10,163
Man of your word.

1223
01:25:11,372 --> 01:25:13,704
Are you running me
back to my car?

1224
01:25:13,774 --> 01:25:18,143
Yeah. I need
to make a stop first. Is that all right?

1225
01:25:18,212 --> 01:25:20,146
Yes.

1226
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,829
This, this is prime
real estate.

1227
01:25:42,903 --> 01:25:44,803
Doesn't look prime.

1228
01:25:44,872 --> 01:25:48,103
See, that's the point.
Now is the time to get in.

1229
01:25:48,175 --> 01:25:52,407
Two, three years from now,
all this we'll be river front condos.

1230
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:54,379
Marble floors,
health spas.

1231
01:25:54,448 --> 01:25:57,246
By that time,
another motherfucker made all the money.

1232
01:25:57,318 --> 01:25:59,878
Don't be going legit
on me now, "Big".

1233
01:25:59,954 --> 01:26:01,751
Money's money.

1234
01:26:01,822 --> 01:26:04,985
Tell you what.
You'll be the front man,

1235
01:26:05,059 --> 01:26:07,926
I'll be the power
behind the throne.

1236
01:26:09,930 --> 01:26:12,626
It's like we're working
for a greater good.

1237
01:26:14,301 --> 01:26:15,791
Yeah, you're right.

1238
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:17,963
This is a good spot
to build condominiums.

1239
01:26:18,038 --> 01:26:21,667
See? I know l
likes you, man. Come on.

1240
01:27:19,133 --> 01:27:20,464
[siren wails]

1241
01:27:25,639 --> 01:27:28,107
May I ask you to step
out of the vehicle?

1242
01:27:28,175 --> 01:27:29,437
What'd I do?

1243
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:31,501
You bought dope.
I watched you buy dope.

1244
01:27:31,578 --> 01:27:33,569
Now stand the fuck up.

1245
01:27:38,052 --> 01:27:39,713
Put your hands
on the car.

1246
01:27:39,787 --> 01:27:42,688
I didn't--I didn't
buy nothing, man.

1247
01:27:44,224 --> 01:27:46,385
No? What's this?

1248
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:47,688
Officer, please, let--

1249
01:27:47,761 --> 01:27:48,989
Please what?

1250
01:27:49,063 --> 01:27:51,327
I don't know how
that shit got in there.

1251
01:27:51,398 --> 01:27:52,490
Did I put it there?

1252
01:27:52,566 --> 01:27:53,931
No, sir.

1253
01:27:54,001 --> 01:27:55,025
Just some
freaking currants?

1254
01:27:55,102 --> 01:27:57,468
Yes, sir.

1255
01:27:57,538 --> 01:27:59,472
That's what you
tell the judge, then.

1256
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:02,771
Maybe you'll get lucky
and he will be a football fan.

1257
01:28:02,843 --> 01:28:04,276
You know who I am?

1258
01:28:04,345 --> 01:28:06,370
Oh, I know who you are.

1259
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:08,472
Then why you wanna
fuck my life up for?

1260
01:28:08,549 --> 01:28:11,279
That's gonna knock me
out the draft.

1261
01:28:11,352 --> 01:28:14,116
I'm sure you'll get
a contract of some kind eventually.

1262
01:28:14,188 --> 01:28:16,554
You run the 40
and what? What's that, four-three?

1263
01:28:18,225 --> 01:28:19,749
Why do you do
this to me?

1264
01:28:19,827 --> 01:28:22,762
For some motherfucking
marijuana, man.

1265
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:25,230
I was gonna by
my mama house.

1266
01:28:25,299 --> 01:28:29,201
So, you're going off
for six points favorites against Texas.

1267
01:28:29,269 --> 01:28:34,571
You win by five or less
or you lose altogether, none of this ever happened.

1268
01:28:35,743 --> 01:28:37,438
Sir, I can't do that.

1269
01:28:37,511 --> 01:28:40,810
A fumble, a missed blocking
assignment. You can absolutely do it.

1270
01:28:40,881 --> 01:28:43,577
Sir, please. Please,
don't make me do that.

1271
01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:45,379
Listen to me, Renaldo.

1272
01:28:45,452 --> 01:28:48,546
I dumped a lot of
money this year on you.

1273
01:28:48,622 --> 01:28:52,319
I got the chance to get
some of that back, I wanna take advantage of it.

1274
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:55,885
You're gonna tell me the
integrity of the game is too much to you, fine.

1275
01:28:55,963 --> 01:28:59,194
I wouldn't dream of
trying to convince you to go against your conscience.

1276
01:28:59,266 --> 01:29:02,758
Turn around.
I'm placing you under arrest.

1277
01:29:02,836 --> 01:29:06,636
You--you won't
tell nobody.

1278
01:29:09,076 --> 01:29:11,772
You ain't gonna
tell nobody?

1279
01:29:43,844 --> 01:29:46,677
[men laughing]

1280
01:29:49,850 --> 01:29:53,581
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
This that Taliban shit. That's what's this is.

1281
01:29:53,654 --> 01:29:57,021
That shit Osama give
a motherfucker before they blow themselves up.

1282
01:29:57,091 --> 01:29:59,218
That's money.
Money.

1283
01:29:59,293 --> 01:30:01,261
Shut up!

1284
01:30:02,529 --> 01:30:04,292
Where's the 15,000?

1285
01:30:04,364 --> 01:30:06,798
You'll get it, man. Relax.

1286
01:30:06,867 --> 01:30:11,770
Did I not do
what I said l was going to do?

1287
01:30:11,839 --> 01:30:15,366
Yeah, man.
Relax.

1288
01:30:15,442 --> 01:30:18,969
Tell me again to relax.

1289
01:30:21,014 --> 01:30:23,539
I'm not looking
to beat you, man.

1290
01:30:24,751 --> 01:30:26,412
Where's my money?

1291
01:30:26,487 --> 01:30:27,613
I'll get your money.

1292
01:30:27,688 --> 01:30:28,677
When?

1293
01:30:28,755 --> 01:30:29,744
Tomorrow.

1294
01:30:29,823 --> 01:30:31,188
Where?

1295
01:30:31,258 --> 01:30:32,725
My place.

1296
01:30:33,894 --> 01:30:36,124
Give me a cut of
the uncut dope.

1297
01:30:36,196 --> 01:30:38,528
Look, I'm gonna
pay you in money.

1298
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:40,032
This is interest.

1299
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:41,590
That's bullshit, man.

1300
01:30:41,668 --> 01:30:43,465
What's that, little man?

1301
01:30:43,537 --> 01:30:46,836
Midge, chill out.

1302
01:30:46,907 --> 01:30:48,636
Here.

1303
01:30:50,210 --> 01:30:53,907
Now, put that gun away
before you kill somebody.

1304
01:30:55,249 --> 01:30:57,217
I'll kill all of you.

1305
01:30:58,886 --> 01:31:01,047
To the break of dawn.

1306
01:31:06,693 --> 01:31:09,685
To the break
of dawn, baby.

1307
01:31:13,233 --> 01:31:18,500
(Terence)
Wassup, wassup, wassup wassup, motherfucker?

1308
01:31:18,572 --> 01:31:20,938
No fucking
bets, Terence.

1309
01:31:21,008 --> 01:31:22,737
What's the matter?
You don't like me?

1310
01:31:22,809 --> 01:31:25,869
You don't pay your debts.
I don't wanna know you. I can't afford it.

1311
01:31:25,946 --> 01:31:28,574
Ten grand!
Five I owe.

1312
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:33,348
Yeah? Five
for Louisiana. Right there. Wassup?

1313
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:34,717
Where did you get this?

1314
01:31:34,788 --> 01:31:37,222
What, are you my priest?
Right there, here.

1315
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:38,758
You got it.

1316
01:31:38,825 --> 01:31:40,315
It's a six-point spread.

1317
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:42,157
No shit.

1318
01:31:48,468 --> 01:31:50,368
Frankie?

1319
01:31:54,174 --> 01:31:56,836
[thundering]

1320
01:31:56,910 --> 01:31:58,400
Frankie!

1321
01:32:07,554 --> 01:32:09,146
Hey.

1322
01:32:09,223 --> 01:32:10,952
I got something for you.

1323
01:32:11,024 --> 01:32:12,889
I need to get
my clothes.

1324
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:16,487
Don't worry about your
clothes right now. This is uncut dope.

1325
01:32:16,563 --> 01:32:20,465
Just a bunch of stuff
from my closet and then from my dresser by the bed.

1326
01:32:20,534 --> 01:32:24,698
I'm not gonna give you much
until we know how strong it is 'cause it's pure, you know?

1327
01:32:24,771 --> 01:32:27,205
Baby, I've been talking
to your father a lot

1328
01:32:27,274 --> 01:32:29,799
and I think I'm gonna go
to a meeting with him.

1329
01:32:32,813 --> 01:32:36,715
What does that mean?
You don't want any?

1330
01:32:36,783 --> 01:32:40,810
I mean, of course
I want some but l, maybe when I get back.

1331
01:32:40,887 --> 01:32:44,448
Frankie. Frankie,
we gotta go.

1332
01:32:45,459 --> 01:32:48,053
Okay? Right.

1333
01:33:47,154 --> 01:33:48,451
Thank you.

1334
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:12,369
This the way
to do business.

1335
01:34:12,446 --> 01:34:16,906
This, this way I ain't
gotta worry about what I'm walking into.

1336
01:34:16,983 --> 01:34:19,144
I got you.

1337
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:22,511
Yeah, let me hit
that shit.

1338
01:34:30,030 --> 01:34:32,089
Yeah.
[laughs]

1339
01:34:38,538 --> 01:34:40,267
You hitting this shit?

1340
01:34:42,008 --> 01:34:46,308
Hey, Midget, light
the Caucasian's rock.

1341
01:34:53,987 --> 01:34:57,252
You're my kind of
motherfucking cop, man.

1342
01:34:57,324 --> 01:34:59,519
You're a crazy,
motherfucker.

1343
01:34:59,593 --> 01:35:01,686
What did that Ki run you.

1344
01:35:02,763 --> 01:35:03,889
What do you care?

1345
01:35:03,964 --> 01:35:05,295
I'm guessing 60,000.

1346
01:35:05,365 --> 01:35:06,457
Very good guess.

1347
01:35:06,533 --> 01:35:08,501
Will you shut
the fuck up?

1348
01:35:08,568 --> 01:35:12,334
You owe me 15 thousand.
I'll take 25% of the dope uncut.

1349
01:35:12,406 --> 01:35:14,203
That means you're
getting my price.

1350
01:35:14,274 --> 01:35:16,765
It's one way
of looking at it.

1351
01:35:16,843 --> 01:35:21,473
The other is, you get to
keep 75% and not go to prison for the rest of your life.

1352
01:35:27,621 --> 01:35:28,952
Yeah.

1353
01:35:29,022 --> 01:35:30,614
Go ahead.

1354
01:35:30,690 --> 01:35:33,215
Make sure you cut
that shit before you sell it,

1355
01:35:33,293 --> 01:35:35,557
unless you wanna kill
the motherfucker who buys it.

1356
01:35:35,629 --> 01:35:38,029
Did I ever tell you
the story about nigger Elk?

1357
01:35:38,098 --> 01:35:39,963
I was watching TV,
the game, right?

1358
01:35:40,033 --> 01:35:43,093
Reynaldo Hayes,
He got tossed the ball. He was running with it.

1359
01:35:43,170 --> 01:35:45,400
He jumped over three
linebackers in midair.

1360
01:35:45,472 --> 01:35:48,669
He sprouted antlers
like a gazelle.

1361
01:35:48,742 --> 01:35:50,209
Like an elk.

1362
01:35:50,277 --> 01:35:52,006
He landed again.
He ran, ran, ran.

1363
01:35:52,078 --> 01:35:53,306
He scored a touchdown!

1364
01:35:56,082 --> 01:35:57,777
Crack talking.

1365
01:35:57,851 --> 01:36:01,082
Listen, I'm not worried
about you, so don't be concerned about me.

1366
01:36:01,154 --> 01:36:05,648
'Cause I'm not concerned
if you're not concerned. I'm not really concerned.

1367
01:36:05,725 --> 01:36:07,556
I'm worried 'cause
if you drop dead,

1368
01:36:07,627 --> 01:36:09,925
I'm the motherfucker
they come looking for.

1369
01:36:09,996 --> 01:36:12,726
And then I gotta
end up having a nigger from Africa

1370
01:36:12,799 --> 01:36:14,460
trying to move in
on my shit.

1371
01:36:14,534 --> 01:36:17,867
And I don't wanna shoot
no more purple ass niggers from Africa.

1372
01:36:17,938 --> 01:36:21,237
Easy, easy, easy, easy.
'Cause I'm not Eazy-E.

1373
01:36:23,143 --> 01:36:24,667
Fucking god.

1374
01:36:24,744 --> 01:36:28,441
Hey. Hey. I need
to go to the store.

1375
01:36:28,515 --> 01:36:29,641
So?

1376
01:36:29,716 --> 01:36:31,115
So I need you
to watch him.

1377
01:36:31,184 --> 01:36:32,811
Fuck, no,
I can't watch him.

1378
01:36:32,886 --> 01:36:35,218
Don't be yelling.
There ain't nothin' to eat.

1379
01:36:36,623 --> 01:36:38,022
Get the fuck
outta here!

1380
01:36:38,091 --> 01:36:39,786
Get the fuck outta here!

1381
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:42,590
Hit me again
with another one on them rocks.

1382
01:36:45,065 --> 01:36:46,862
What the fuck's that?

1383
01:36:48,235 --> 01:36:50,965
It's my lucky
crack pipe.

1384
01:36:51,037 --> 01:36:52,698
You crazy motherfucker.

1385
01:36:52,772 --> 01:36:54,865
You don't have
a lucky crack pipe?

1386
01:36:54,941 --> 01:36:58,433
No, I don't have a lucky
motherfucking crack pipe.

1387
01:36:58,512 --> 01:37:01,242
Then, Donald, you're
gonna take a hit of mine.

1388
01:37:01,314 --> 01:37:03,339
Why I gotta do that?

1389
01:37:03,416 --> 01:37:05,316
'Cause it's lucky.

1390
01:37:07,687 --> 01:37:09,780
Shit.

1391
01:37:09,856 --> 01:37:12,154
Lucky crack pipe.

1392
01:37:20,033 --> 01:37:21,557
[woman screams]

1393
01:37:21,635 --> 01:37:25,537
Sorry we're late, fellas.
I hope you didn't wait dinner.

1394
01:37:25,605 --> 01:37:27,368
Who the fuck are you?

1395
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,408
Third party beneficiary.

1396
01:37:29,476 --> 01:37:31,842
Your friend here
can fill you in on the details.

1397
01:37:31,912 --> 01:37:34,847
I'm working on getting
your money, Dave. That's what I'm doing here.

1398
01:37:34,915 --> 01:37:38,112
I don't know about you,
but the hardest part of collecting debts

1399
01:37:38,184 --> 01:37:39,947
is having to listen
to the stories.

1400
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:41,487
Terence owes you
some money?

1401
01:37:41,555 --> 01:37:44,649
$50,000. Plus my two
young friends here

1402
01:37:44,724 --> 01:37:47,784
were supposed to have
a sexual experience of their choosing

1403
01:37:47,861 --> 01:37:52,230
with an attractive woman.
Nothing. He came across with none of it.

1404
01:37:52,299 --> 01:37:56,599
That's wrong. That's wrong
you don't do what you say you're gonna do, Terence.

1405
01:37:56,670 --> 01:37:58,763
The dope's worth
more than 50,000.

1406
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:01,598
Take it.

1407
01:38:01,675 --> 01:38:04,371
Why don't I take
all the dope?

1408
01:38:04,444 --> 01:38:07,413
Why are you gonna take
what belongs to me?

1409
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:09,846
Well, there was a time
when I wouldn't have.

1410
01:38:09,916 --> 01:38:13,010
I would've taken what
was mine and left the rest on the table.

1411
01:38:13,086 --> 01:38:16,078
But, you see,
I never got rich enough to retire.

1412
01:38:16,156 --> 01:38:19,853
I'm stuck
doing this shit.

1413
01:38:19,926 --> 01:38:22,087
And I'm not
young anymore.

1414
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:26,263
So now I don't leave
nothing on the table.

1415
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:28,028
Pick it up.

1416
01:38:54,361 --> 01:38:55,885
Shoot him again.

1417
01:38:55,962 --> 01:38:57,395
What for?

1418
01:38:57,464 --> 01:38:59,659
His soul's still dancing.

1419
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:24,857
(Terence)
Shoot him again.

1420
01:39:24,924 --> 01:39:26,516
[gunshot]

1421
01:39:56,389 --> 01:39:58,118
Good night, Lieutenant.

1422
01:40:00,894 --> 01:40:02,293
What are you
doing tonight?

1423
01:40:02,362 --> 01:40:04,193
I'm getting outta
here and go to bed.

1424
01:40:04,264 --> 01:40:07,529
Just for fun, why don't
you stop by the apartment on Josephine?

1425
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:08,999
For fun?

1426
01:40:09,069 --> 01:40:11,060
You might find something
interesting there.

1427
01:40:11,137 --> 01:40:12,866
Like what?

1428
01:40:12,939 --> 01:40:16,375
These bushwhackers
might've hit a crack pipe while they were there.

1429
01:40:16,443 --> 01:40:20,971
You know? The odd chance is
he dropped it under the bed where the kids were.

1430
01:40:21,047 --> 01:40:22,639
And we missed it.

1431
01:40:22,716 --> 01:40:25,549
The DNA'd place
them at the scene.

1432
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:29,117
You had a vision, right?

1433
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:33,982
Deoxyribonucleic acid.

1434
01:41:12,665 --> 01:41:15,133
(Terence)
Frankie? Frankie.

1435
01:41:17,871 --> 01:41:19,930
Where's Frankie?
She's not in the house?

1436
01:41:20,006 --> 01:41:21,997
Frankie's on her
way to rehab.

1437
01:41:22,075 --> 01:41:23,770
Rehab?

1438
01:41:23,843 --> 01:41:26,573
What about her clothes?

1439
01:41:26,646 --> 01:41:29,410
Someone will
bring her her clothes.

1440
01:41:31,117 --> 01:41:33,585
Anything else
you wanna know?

1441
01:41:35,555 --> 01:41:37,614
[mumbles]

1442
01:42:00,146 --> 01:42:02,478
You don't have
to hide it from me.

1443
01:42:03,516 --> 01:42:06,815
We're birds
of a feather.

1444
01:42:06,886 --> 01:42:09,582
We both like
our poison.

1445
01:42:11,324 --> 01:42:14,020
You just drink
beer, I thought.

1446
01:43:01,875 --> 01:43:04,969
Do you mind if
I watch the game?

1447
01:43:05,044 --> 01:43:07,842
Mh-mh. Be my guest.

1448
01:43:17,323 --> 01:43:22,124
(reporter)
I cannot believe what I'm witnessing.

1449
01:43:22,195 --> 01:43:25,187
Louisiana up
by 18 points in the second quarter.

1450
01:43:25,265 --> 01:43:26,926
For another score.

1451
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,661
You wanna share?

1452
01:43:28,735 --> 01:43:31,568
Back to pass.
He scrambles.

1453
01:43:31,638 --> 01:43:33,970
Hobbs builds his
way to another--

1454
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:36,531
I don't know.

1455
01:43:38,177 --> 01:43:41,476
And all this without
Renaldo Hayes.

1456
01:43:42,982 --> 01:43:45,212
We still don't know
the nature of his injury.

1457
01:43:45,285 --> 01:43:47,310
Just that he's taken
himself out of the line.

1458
01:43:47,387 --> 01:43:49,321
I'll kill him.

1459
01:43:49,389 --> 01:43:52,825
Renaldo Hayes being out,
the freshman Johnson has really stepped up

1460
01:43:52,892 --> 01:43:56,089
for this football team.
You're in the land of miracles, my boy.

1461
01:43:56,162 --> 01:43:58,995
I'm looking right there
at Hayes, and I'll tell you what.

1462
01:43:59,065 --> 01:44:03,365
The guy just does not look
like a happy guy. He's on the sideline.

1463
01:44:03,403 --> 01:44:06,031
He's obviously suffering
from some sort of injury.

1464
01:44:47,947 --> 01:44:49,209
Hey, guys.

1465
01:44:49,282 --> 01:44:51,375
Good to see you.

1466
01:44:51,451 --> 01:44:52,713
Listen.

1467
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:56,514
This stuff, this
thing between us,

1468
01:44:56,589 --> 01:45:00,047
it's gotten way
out of hand. Got way outta hand.

1469
01:45:00,126 --> 01:45:01,889
Okay?

1470
01:45:01,961 --> 01:45:05,397
Those gumbos, couple
of fucking assholes.

1471
01:45:05,465 --> 01:45:08,798
They disappeared because
of something you did to them.

1472
01:45:08,868 --> 01:45:12,736
Whoa, man, I got
no beef with you whatsoever.

1473
01:45:12,805 --> 01:45:15,797
Everything between me,
right as rain.

1474
01:45:15,875 --> 01:45:17,570
And I want
you to know

1475
01:45:17,643 --> 01:45:20,168
that my father
got in touch with his guy

1476
01:45:20,246 --> 01:45:22,237
and he told him
whoever it is,

1477
01:45:22,315 --> 01:45:25,250
that complaint has
been withdrawn. Finished.

1478
01:45:25,318 --> 01:45:27,149
Oh, yeah.

1479
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:29,484
Okay?

1480
01:45:31,457 --> 01:45:33,049
Okay.

1481
01:45:34,127 --> 01:45:36,322
Oh, yeah?

1482
01:45:38,031 --> 01:45:39,896
Uh, phew.

1483
01:45:43,603 --> 01:45:45,298
Okay.

1484
01:45:45,371 --> 01:45:46,861
That's the way out.

1485
01:45:46,939 --> 01:45:48,600
Oh, yeah.

1486
01:45:51,544 --> 01:45:53,444
Oh, no. Look, Ned,

1487
01:45:53,513 --> 01:45:56,175
if you'd called first,
I would've saved you the trip.

1488
01:45:56,249 --> 01:46:00,515
I'm guessing
that you didn't see the game.

1489
01:46:03,256 --> 01:46:05,121
How did this happen?

1490
01:46:05,191 --> 01:46:08,592
Louisiana by three.

1491
01:46:08,661 --> 01:46:10,822
Hayes ended up playing?

1492
01:46:10,897 --> 01:46:12,296
Nope.

1493
01:46:13,566 --> 01:46:14,828
Worked out anyway.

1494
01:46:14,901 --> 01:46:16,425
What are you
talking about?

1495
01:46:16,502 --> 01:46:17,764
Nothing.

1496
01:46:17,837 --> 01:46:19,429
Oh,

1497
01:46:19,505 --> 01:46:22,633
and my daughter's
tickets, speeding tickets,

1498
01:46:22,708 --> 01:46:25,074
thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1499
01:46:25,144 --> 01:46:27,772
This female highway
patrol officer calls up,

1500
01:46:27,847 --> 01:46:29,815
says they're
taken care of.

1501
01:46:32,618 --> 01:46:34,882
It's $10,000.
Sure you don't wanna count it?

1502
01:46:34,954 --> 01:46:36,444
I trust you.

1503
01:46:36,522 --> 01:46:38,615
All right, man.
You take care or yourself.

1504
01:46:38,691 --> 01:46:39,817
All right.

1505
01:46:41,961 --> 01:46:43,588
Great news.

1506
01:46:43,663 --> 01:46:46,689
Our man came up with this
at the crime scene on Josephine.

1507
01:46:46,766 --> 01:46:48,427
I just got lucky.

1508
01:46:48,501 --> 01:46:51,959
The lab found
Godshaw's DNA on it.

1509
01:46:52,038 --> 01:46:54,734
[all laugh]

1510
01:46:56,809 --> 01:46:59,505
That is fantastic!

1511
01:46:59,579 --> 01:47:01,604
Yes!

1512
01:47:05,051 --> 01:47:06,746
Oh, look at that.

1513
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:36,314
I found the spoon.

1514
01:47:39,185 --> 01:47:40,846
It's not silver.

1515
01:47:42,188 --> 01:47:44,418
It went rusty.

1516
01:47:44,490 --> 01:47:46,515
I wanna give it to you.

1517
01:47:48,361 --> 01:47:50,124
It's yours.

1518
01:47:51,230 --> 01:47:52,925
It's for me?

1519
01:48:00,006 --> 01:48:02,133
That's so sweet.

1520
01:48:13,853 --> 01:48:15,445
It's beautiful.

1521
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:29,425
(Godshaw)
Yeah, I need eight of them.

1522
01:48:29,502 --> 01:48:31,663
Yes, eight.

1523
01:48:31,737 --> 01:48:35,605
Uh-huh. It's
going down, baby.

1524
01:48:35,675 --> 01:48:39,042
Yeah, I got some help.
I'm telling you.

1525
01:48:39,111 --> 01:48:42,478
Police Department.
Stand up. Keep your hands where we can see them.

1526
01:48:42,548 --> 01:48:44,209
What the fuck is this?

1527
01:48:44,283 --> 01:48:46,308
We got it.
Check the outside,

1528
01:48:46,385 --> 01:48:49,218
check the backyard,
check upstairs, check his car.

1529
01:48:49,288 --> 01:48:51,950
We got this. It's okay.
Good. We're good. Upstairs.

1530
01:48:52,024 --> 01:48:53,218
(Terence)
Cuff him.

1531
01:48:53,292 --> 01:48:54,987
No.

1532
01:48:56,495 --> 01:48:58,622
No.

1533
01:48:58,698 --> 01:49:00,461
What do you
mean no?

1534
01:49:00,533 --> 01:49:03,696
This is what happens.
Before we can cuff him, he goes for this weapon,

1535
01:49:03,769 --> 01:49:05,737
we shoot this prick
and steal his shit.

1536
01:49:05,805 --> 01:49:08,467
Fuck. Terence, what--
What are we doing?

1537
01:49:08,541 --> 01:49:10,566
I thought we had
our thing going.

1538
01:49:10,643 --> 01:49:14,545
You're wrong, baby.
He acts like he likes you 'cause he likes to get high.

1539
01:49:14,614 --> 01:49:17,742
Huh? That don't mean
he stop bein' the police.

1540
01:49:17,817 --> 01:49:19,114
Cuff him, Stevie.

1541
01:49:19,185 --> 01:49:20,880
No. Can you draw
a line of murder?

1542
01:49:20,953 --> 01:49:22,580
It's interesting
where to wreck its fun.

1543
01:49:22,655 --> 01:49:24,987
I said cuff him, Stevie.

1544
01:49:25,057 --> 01:49:27,389
This is about money.
You want my fucking money?

1545
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:31,328
You want my fucking money?
Take my money! You won't kill me for this shit.

1546
01:49:31,397 --> 01:49:34,161
Go for it, son.
Go for it.

1547
01:49:34,233 --> 01:49:35,962
Got for it.
Go for it!

1548
01:49:38,170 --> 01:49:39,694
Yeah, yeah.

1549
01:49:41,774 --> 01:49:43,674
Next time.

1550
01:49:43,743 --> 01:49:46,177
Now fucking cuff him.

1551
01:49:49,749 --> 01:49:52,877
I said cuff the
motherfucker, Stevie!

1552
01:49:52,952 --> 01:49:56,217
[United States anthem]

1553
01:50:01,961 --> 01:50:05,488
[people singing
the anthem]

1554
01:50:18,377 --> 01:50:23,110
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is an honor to conclude this year on a positive note.

1555
01:50:23,182 --> 01:50:26,640
In recognition of his
leadership and tenacity

1556
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:29,711
in the investigation
of the Ndele family murders

1557
01:50:29,789 --> 01:50:33,350
resulting in the successful
apprehension and prosecution

1558
01:50:33,426 --> 01:50:36,020
of the three
individuals responsible,

1559
01:50:36,095 --> 01:50:41,727
I'm proud to include
Lieutenant Terence McDonagh among those being promoted

1560
01:50:41,801 --> 01:50:45,567
to the rank of captain.
Captain McDonagh.

1561
01:50:45,638 --> 01:50:47,037
[applauses]

1562
01:50:53,279 --> 01:50:54,678
Woo!

1563
01:51:11,430 --> 01:51:13,660
Excuse me.
Would you care for some wine?

1564
01:51:13,733 --> 01:51:16,998
No, thank you.
We're all gonna stick with our sparkling water.

1565
01:51:19,638 --> 01:51:22,163
I would like
to make a toast.

1566
01:51:23,142 --> 01:51:25,269
To the new Captain.

1567
01:51:25,344 --> 01:51:27,710
To new life.

1568
01:51:27,780 --> 01:51:30,078
I'm probably
gonna start to cry right now.

1569
01:51:30,149 --> 01:51:32,276
Oh, that's okay.

1570
01:51:33,586 --> 01:51:35,349
To my new family.

1571
01:51:35,421 --> 01:51:37,116
God bless.

1572
01:51:37,189 --> 01:51:38,679
Here, here.

1573
01:52:04,650 --> 01:52:08,313
You still gonna be working
on night shift when I get closer to the due date?

1574
01:52:08,387 --> 01:52:11,618
I'll make sure I'm
not. How is that?

1575
01:52:11,690 --> 01:52:16,650
I could get to the hospital
and all, but I like having you home at night.

1576
01:52:16,729 --> 01:52:19,027
I like it better
that way, too.

1577
01:52:51,330 --> 01:52:53,798
[women laugh]

1578
01:52:56,235 --> 01:52:58,226
Thank you, darling.

1579
01:53:23,729 --> 01:53:25,128
(guy)
All right.

1580
01:53:25,197 --> 01:53:26,664
There we go.

1581
01:53:26,732 --> 01:53:28,393
Where are your keys?

1582
01:53:28,467 --> 01:53:30,128
Did I give them to you?

1583
01:53:30,202 --> 01:53:31,567
No, I don't
think you did.

1584
01:53:31,637 --> 01:53:32,968
Stand against the wall.

1585
01:53:33,038 --> 01:53:34,164
What'd we do?

1586
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:35,707
Hey, stand
against the wall.

1587
01:53:35,774 --> 01:53:37,435
What are you doing?

1588
01:53:37,510 --> 01:53:40,638
The two of you match
a description. Passing drugs in the club.

1589
01:53:40,713 --> 01:53:44,444
Don't say anything.
Do exactly what I tell you to do.

1590
01:53:44,517 --> 01:53:46,985
So, what are we
high on tonight?

1591
01:53:47,052 --> 01:53:48,383
Nothing.

1592
01:53:48,454 --> 01:53:51,423
Empty your pockets.
Dump out the handbag.

1593
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:06,131
[knocking at the door]

1594
01:54:06,205 --> 01:54:07,934
Room service.

1595
01:54:08,007 --> 01:54:10,237
I didn't order
any room service.

1596
01:54:10,309 --> 01:54:14,609
Oh. It must've been
a mistake again.

1597
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:17,205
Holy shit.

1598
01:54:17,283 --> 01:54:20,116
I'm Evaristo Chavez, man.
You saved my life.

1599
01:54:20,185 --> 01:54:22,915
I was in the prison
that was flooding.

1600
01:54:22,988 --> 01:54:24,114
Oh, yeah.

1601
01:54:24,189 --> 01:54:25,588
Do you remember me?

1602
01:54:25,658 --> 01:54:28,024
Are you still with
the Police Department?

1603
01:54:28,093 --> 01:54:30,926
Port of call
still New Orleans.

1604
01:54:32,665 --> 01:54:33,996
Okay.

1605
01:54:34,066 --> 01:54:36,057
What happened with you?

1606
01:54:36,135 --> 01:54:38,660
The judge remanded
to a drug treatment program.

1607
01:54:38,737 --> 01:54:41,763
November 14th
I have a year clean.

1608
01:54:43,142 --> 01:54:45,269
Congratulations.

1609
01:54:50,382 --> 01:54:52,680
Are you all right?

1610
01:54:54,219 --> 01:54:57,347
Sometimes l
have bad days.

1611
01:55:00,092 --> 01:55:01,787
Listen,

1612
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:03,691
you saved my life.

1613
01:55:03,762 --> 01:55:08,256
I'm almost done working.
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

1614
01:55:08,334 --> 01:55:10,029
Okay?

1615
01:55:13,405 --> 01:55:16,101
Do fish have dreams?

1616
01:55:36,562 --> 01:55:38,757
You know, Chavez,

1617
01:55:38,831 --> 01:55:42,267
I still hate
that I ruined my underwear for you.

1618
01:56:21,373 --> 01:56:23,068
[laughs]
