345
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,667
Baby, congratulations.

346
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,984
ANGELA:
You know what I want to do to you?

347
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,624
- What do you want to do?
- Let's go upstairs.

348
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,319
- No. No.
- Yeah, yeah.

349
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,159
No, because if we go up there you
know what's going to happen.

350
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,719
- You'll want to brush your teeth.
- Mmm-hmm.

351
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,359
After that you're going
to wash your face.

352
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,639
Then you got to put cream
and stuff on your face.

353
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,599
Let's be spontaneous.
Let's do it right here.

354
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,199
- I want to be wild like a savage.
- Okay.

355
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,679
Give you that Kawasaki.
(IMITATES MOTORCYCLE REVVING)

356
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,999
I'm about to give it
to you right now.

357
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,279
- You know what I want?
- What you want?

358
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,679
I want that kaboom.

359
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,199
Girl, you're trying
to crawl down...

360
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,319
The Black Hammer.

361
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,679
- You want the hammer?
- I want the hammer.

362
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,199
Then go get the hammer.

363
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,359
Okay. Enough of that nastiness.

364
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,479
Oh, my God!
(SCREAMS)

365
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,623
Babe, call 911! Now!

366
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,959
Get out of my house,
you son of a bitch!

367
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,307
(GROANS)

368
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,719
JAMES: I can't believe this shit.

369
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,879
Angela, what if I was
a real intruder?

370
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,199
Instead of my brother
creeping around my house?

371
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,501
Wasn't nobody creeping.

372
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,199
You were sitting in the dark
with a coke and a hot dog.

373
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,039
If you'd lock the door
or close the window

374
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,679
or bar that patio like I told you.

375
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,879
This is exactly why I didn't let
you install the alarm system.

376
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,199
It's about who's going to
protect you. This weenie?

377
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,359
One, he is not a weenie!
(JAMES SCOFFS)

378
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,199
He can be weenie-ish,

379
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,199
weenie-like, but I love
him, so it doesn't matter.

380
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,159
I picture you with somebody
with a little more prestige.

381
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,919
Somebody who plays for the Falcons

382
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,119
or the Braves, or even the Hawks.

383
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,399
Braves. Yeah.

384
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,031
Not with the mascot.

385
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,559
James, listen to me,

386
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,079
you do not screw this up for me.

387
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,679
BEN: Hey, guys.

388
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,719
I can hear what you're saying.
So if you want to stop.

389
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,879
Damn, it's Sir Scream-a-Lot.

390
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,999
James...

391
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,039
I was responding to a
hostile situation, James.

392
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,239
I have no shame in that.

393
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,519
You call for backup when
there's a hostile situation.

394
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,919
That wasn't calling for backup.

395
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,679
That was a high-pitched scream,

396
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,359
and you pushed my
sister in the way.

397
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,719
I pushed your sister
out of harm's way.

398
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,439
You shined the light at us.

399
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,439
It's different strokes
for different folks.

400
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,759
Put the ice pack in his
mouth. No, on his head.

401
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,039
Don't put the ice pack
on my head, babe.

402
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,399
I'm sensitive to extreme measures
of cold and you know that.

403
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,599
Put it on your head,

404
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,239
because you just got
knocked out by yourself.

405
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,746
James, you know what? You...

406
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,021
Um...

407
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,541
Guys, maybe we should...

408
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,026
What?

409
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,959
Is he still staring?
Make him stop.

410
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,479
Look. We were in the middle of
something, so you have to go.

411
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,839
Y'all wasn't in the
middle of nothing.

412
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,426
We were, James.

413
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,439
- Let's go. Get out.
- I got my sandwich over here.

414
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,959
Listen. Listen, I'm going.
Bar that patio door.

415
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,945
ANGELA: I will. Thank you.
Promise. Love you.

416
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,424
Hey, James, wait up.

417
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,023
Hey, can you wait up, please?

418
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,581
Hey.

419
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,879
Look, man...

420
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,799
I know that you don't
really like me,

421
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,799
but I feel like you don't like
me because you don't know me.

422
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,580
Nope, you're wrong. I don't
like you because I do know you.

423
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,109
Well, I bet you'll like this.

424
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,359
I got accepted into the
police academy today.

425
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,879
I'm going to be a cop. I've been
trying to call you all day.

426
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,479
I'm finally going to have a career
that I can be proud of, man,

427
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,465
and Angela can be
proud of, and you.

428
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,039
Who knows, maybe we can
be partners or something.

429
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,466
(SPITS)

430
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,861
Okay.

431
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,159
Now that I got things
straight, I feel like

432
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,359
I can finally make your
sister an honest woman.

433
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,310
There's just one thing
standing in the way.

434
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,426
I was wondering if I could get your
blessing to ask Angela to marry me.

435
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,460
BEN: James?

436
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,141
Did you hear what I said?

437
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,079
I have to go.

438
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,359
Yeah, okay.

439
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,319
I figured that you
probably just got to

440
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,319
let everything sink in,
which is fine.

441
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,703
Maybe we could take a ride
later and talk about all this?

442
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,519
Oh, shit.

443
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,119
So, just because you
joined the academy,

444
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,582
that suddenly makes
you ready to propose?

445
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,199
Yes. I mean, no!

446
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,639
I've been ready.

447
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,519
Look, I figured that if
I made it through the academy

448
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,999
that you would be
forced to accept me.

449
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,199
Is that right?

450
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,399
I just want to show
you the real me.

451
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,599
I don't want to be known as
the guy who set you on fire.

452
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,279
In my defense, that was a mistake.

453
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,959
I tried to put you out.
I got water, but you panicked.

454
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,359
I don't even want
to dig into that.

455
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,199
That's getting off subject.
I want to talk to you...

456
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,389
Show and prove.

457
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,959
Show and what? What are you...

458
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,239
You want to marry my sister?

459
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,110
Show me you're worthy of her.

460
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,821
And prove to me you
got what it takes.

461
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,639
How do you want me to
do that? I don't get it.

462
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,079
Tomorrow, I'm going to
take you on a ride-along.

463
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,781
You can show me what kind
of man you're made of.

464
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,599
And prove to me

465
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,427
that you deserve somebody
as special as Angela.

466
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,629
- Hell, yeah.
- Mmm-hmm.

467
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,950
Thank you, man.

468
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,504
I cannot wait to show you that I'm
twice the man that you think I am.

469
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,639
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

470
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,908
All right. I'll see you then.

471
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,745
It's time to let go.

472
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,439
Hey, this is going to be great.

473
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,742
You will not regret this.

474
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,786
Mmm...

475
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,226
(SNIFFS)

476
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,519
Morning.

477
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,679
(GASPS)

478
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,391
James!

479
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,999
Didn't I tell you to
bar that patio door?

480
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,719
What are you doing, man?
It's 6:00 in the morning.

481
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,119
Good cops wake up
before the crooks.

482
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,910
Get your ass up. Let's go.

483
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,380
Okay.

484
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,710
James, that's not cool!

485
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,266
All right.

486
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,111
I'm ready, man.

487
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,781
Boom.

488
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,759
You forgetting something?

489
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,079
Uh-uh. Forgetting what?

490
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,999
This could be the last time Angela
sees your little ass alive.

491
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,745
Don't you want to say goodbye?

492
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,999
No.

493
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,506
You can get shot today.

494
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,719
You know that, right?

495
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,863
Dead. You.

496
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,791
Ang?

497
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,181
Hey, babe?

498
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,439
Listen, James just
told me I could die.

499
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,199
ANGELA:
No, you're not going to die.

500
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,599
If I do die, I want you
to know that I love you.

501
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,719
Yes, baby, I know.

502
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,199
If this was a latte,
it would be a love latte.

503
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,639
And you make me think of rainbows,
because we both love colors.

504
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,879
Aw.

505
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,599
And I love the way your hands open
up and close, like monkey paws.

506
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,759
Remember when we ate
that peanut butter?

507
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,039
You was like, "Put it on your
nose," and I was like, "No."

508
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,799
That's the day I fell
in love with you.

509
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,999
Give me a kiss.

510
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,519
- I want five of 'em in a row.
- Five?

511
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,026
BOTH: Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

512
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,239
BEN: Deal. Done.

513
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,746
ANGELA: Go, go, go.

514
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,879
Hey. I hope I don't die, because
I still got a lot more to say,

515
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,467

had a car like this!

What's under the hood?
A 5.7 liter Hemi?

519
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,479
Look at these tires! Those
are 22-inch Z Pirellis.

520
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,759
That's a racing tire!

521
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,588
Are you driving it with the traction
control or the posi... Okay. Okay.

522
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,439
I need a minute with you.
Where's your team?

523
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,119
I got them sitting on a location.

Benjamin Barber. Prospective.

00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,719
Prospective what?

527
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,479
I'm a pre-cadet at the academy.

528
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,919
I didn't realize
that was a category.

529
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,639
No, I got him from that

530
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,999
I'm starting to do some
mentoring and shit.

531
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,039
I'm just surprised you let
anybody in the car with you.

532
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,999
I'm starting to take your advice.

The other perp from the underground

Because I'm pretty sure he
knows what's going down.

Kind of hard for the guy to
talk with his jaw wired shut.

He'll live. Hey, Lieutenant...

I think you're wrong about
this Serbian connection.

- It's a waiver.

Sign it.

You don't just sign stuff.
What does it say?

558
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,479
That states if you get
your face burnt off,

or you take rebar
through your chest,

by a hep C needle,

with the tightness?

Keeps my body dry.
It wicks the moisture.

don't take it off.

escalate any situation.

you're outnumbered,

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,039
They trying to push something.
They got a shipment coming in.

861
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,239
That's all I know.

862
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,799
I'm about to make
a citizen's arrest.

863
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,559
I'll make a citizen's arrest, too.

864
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,879
For what?

865
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,399
Impersonating an officer.

866
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,959
What?

867
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,705
You said you were a cop.
That's illegal.

868
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,519
That is it, boy. This is what
I'm going to do time for.

869
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,279
You better give up your brother.
Give me your brother!

870
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,359
Stranger danger!

871
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,439
What?

872
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,079
Stranger danger! Stranger danger!

873
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,679
Man, let me fix you up.

874
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,359
I don't want to touch you there.
You want to see my what?

875
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,919
- I don't want to see yours.
- He's playing.

876
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,159
My mama says that's private.

877
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,399
That's my nephew.

878
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,079
He's trying to touch
all the little boys.

879
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,159
Get him!

880
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,719
Who got next? Who playing?

881
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,879
MAN: Let's see your badge!

882
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,227
You got next? What's up?

883
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,119
I'll be leaving here
in a few minutes.

884
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,159
Once this little midget
gets back in the car.

885
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,679
Start the car!

886
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,199
BOY: Run, shorty, run!

887
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,629
Open the door!
It's me! Open the door!

888
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,906
BOY: Go cry home to your mama.

889
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,984
- What took you so long?
- BEN: We should go.

890
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,239
Do the thing. Make the tires skirt!

891
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,190
(TIRES SCREECHING)

892
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,799
JAMES: How did that work
out for you back there?

893
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,181
BEN: Uh...

894
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,719
I think it would have worked out
a lot better if I had a gun.

895
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,999
So, you need a gun to
interrogate children?

896
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,359
It's about having confidence.

897
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,839
Me having a gun just gives me a
certain level of confidence.

898
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,519
Knowing that it's below my belt.
That's all I'm saying, man.

899
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,439
Have you ever even
held a gun before?

900
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,159
The PX-48R controller is
extremely realistic. Okay?

901
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,519
(LAUGHING)

902
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,719
What are you laughing at?

903
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,879
Are you talking
about a video game?

904
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,959
Yes.

905
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,679
Don't mention those stupid
video games to me, okay?

906
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,439
Don't say stupid. Don't
call my games stupid.

907
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,479
It is stupid.

908
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,239
In my world, do you know what
you would be considered?

909
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,799
- A newbie.
- A newbie?

910
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,599
A newbie. You have any idea
what level player I am?

911
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,679
No.

912
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,759
You have no idea.

913
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,904
My gamer tag is spoken in
hushed terms of awe and envy.

914
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,599
When I log on, people go crazy.

915
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,479
"Oh, my God! Black Hammer's in!
(WHISPERS) Black Hammer."

916
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,559
Shit's not real.

917
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,439
You would be lost in my world.

918
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,469
Black Hammer would not help you.

919
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,706
Let me show you my world,
all right? The real deal.

920
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,160
BEN: Why don't we just go
to the department range?

921
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,959
Because that's for cops only.
Which you are not.

922
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,759
Yet. Which I'm not yet.

923
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,439
- Hey, James.
- Hey, Val, how you doing?

924
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,839
Good. How's it going?

925
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,639
Pretty fair for a square.

926
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,829
Got to train a new booty today.

927
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,319
I'm new booty?

928
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,439
- I'm Val.
- How you doing? I'm Ben. New booty.

929
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,359
- Good to see you, Ben.
- You, too.

930
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,199
- They got everything you need here.
- Right. Right.

931
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,839
- But this the real deal.
- Mmm-hmm.

932
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,039
It's not a Xbox. No
video game controllers.

933
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,439
- Just real deal.
- Right.

934
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,439
Here's the handguns.
Val can hook you up.

935
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,141
Beretta, Glock, whatever.

936
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,119
I wish Assface was here.

937
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,519
Because he's more of a suppression
fire disciple, you know?

938
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,479
I'm glad Assface is not here.

939
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,919
Why would you say that? He should
be here. This is his world, too.

940
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,039
Uh...

941
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,399
I could choose whatever I want?

942
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,759
Knock yourself out.

943
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,143
All right. You said it.
No take-back-sies.

944
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,719
What do I want? What do I want...

945
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,759
Hurry up. You act like you're
looking for doughnuts.

946
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,839
- Why are you so impatient?
- I got shit to do.

947
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,239
- Give me a second.
- Let's go!

948
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,871
Fine, fine.

949
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,110
I want to get...

950
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,959
I don't want that one.
I want this one.

951
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,199
- I want to go with this one.
- Pick it.

952
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,839
Smith and Wesson 500.
Let me get that.

953
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,039
- All right.
- It's a good choice, ain't it?

954
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,319
500 Smith and Wesson.

955
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,701
You like that choice.

956
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,799
- You like it.
- Here you go.

957
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,039
Oh, ho, ho!

958
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,839
Bang, bang... Shit!

959
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,919
- Problem?
- Did you feel that? No, no problem...

960
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,999
Got it?

961
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,399
Can I do that thing?
Like how they do that...

962
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,599
You know what?

963
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,039
Can you do it?

964
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,199
Let's just go with the Glock.

965
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,319
All right.

966
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,039
That's a good choice, boy.

967
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,119
Don't touch me.

968
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,839
That's a tap. I didn't touch you.
There's a difference.

969
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,999
This is touching.
I didn't touch you.

970
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,079
There we go.

971
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,799
- Hey, what's this? Shit!
- Oh!

972
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,599
It's all right, I got it.

973
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,759
- You got it?
- Got it.

974
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,799
- You want me to help you set it up?
- No, Ben I got it.

975
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,943
Should we get a book?
(GUNS FIRING)

976
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,679
Let's see what you got.

977
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,799
Do we need goggles or earplugs
or anything like that?

978
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,199
No, usually the bad guys don't give
us time to put on that kind of stuff.

979
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,519
Okay, right. That's
actually a good point.

980
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,759
It makes a lot of sense, and
it's better to keep it real.

981
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,559
I would rather this be real.
You know what I mean?

982
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,181
- Keep it real.
- Yeah. Okay. (GRUNTS)

983
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,826
Here we go.

984
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,705
Freeze! How do you say freeze?

985
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,151
- Freeze.
- Freeze.

986
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,359
- Freeze.
- Freeze.

987
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,439
Okay. You know what it is? You
don't move your top lip that much.

988
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,759
I move my top lip so it
doesn't come out stern.

989
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,959
You get what I'm saying?
(IN DEEP VOICE) Freeze.

990
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,119
Freeze.

991
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,919
- Just shoot.
- Shoot.

992
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,119
- Shoot.
- Shoot.

993
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,919
You pronounce everything.
I got you. You ready? Here we go.

994
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,039
Freeze! Atlanta PD!

995
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,359
Get on the ground!
Hands behind your head!

996
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,599
Fingers laced!

997
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,799
You better lace them! Lace them!

998
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,239
- Shoot the gun.
- Okay. All right.

999
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,065
Ready? Here we go.

1000
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,261
Damn it!

1001
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,559
I pinched it. I pinched
the inside of my hand.

1002
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,719
I don't think the sight on
the gun is quite calibrated.

1003
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,624
The way I was shooting,
it looks a little...

1004
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,307
Yeah, it's off by a
centimeter or two.

1005
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,079
You right-handed or left-handed?

1006
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,399
You were doing both.
You're ambidextrous.

1007
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,159
That's why I like shotguns. I'm
more of a shotgun specialist,

1008
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,079
because I need both of my
hands, because my upper body...

1009
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,119
Let me use your 12-gauge, man.

1010
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,787
Be careful, it's got a
magnum loaded in it.

1011
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,188
Oh, yeah. (LAUGHING)

1012
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,879
Now we're talking. The street
sweeper. Just like Fallujah.

1013
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,319
Just like Fallujah.

1014

Denzel, <i>Training Day.</i>

1016
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,919
You might want to step
back a little bit.

1017
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,799
This thing got a little
kick to it. Okay?

1018
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,105
Freeze! You better stop before
I put a hole in your back!

1019
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,599
Oh, you think it's a game?

1020
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,439
Oh, it's on now!

1021
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,071
Oh, shit!

1022
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,710
Got a little bit of kick to it.

1023
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,668
My stomach in my ass.

1024
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,183
Oh, yeah, you're ready
for the streets.

1025
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,827
This gun should be banned.

1026
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,959
I really appreciate everything.

1027
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,785
No problem, man.

1028
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,820
Well! How did it go?

1029
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,960
BEN: (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)

about to buy her with a goat.

have no damn partner.

to trust somebody, James.

why you don't like me.

I've spent a lot of time, lot
of money thinking about you.

1875
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,199
I spent so much money in fact,

1876
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,479
your boys are now working for me.

1877
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,145
Everything all right with
your packages, fellas?

1878
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,159
- Yes, sir.
- SANTIAGO: Come to the other side, man.

1879
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,399
Let go of this self-respect shit.

1880
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,239
Last I heard, it ain't buying
you a house in Florida.

1881
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:07,079
See, everybody wants to be
on the winning side, James.

1882
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,519
That's what I want for you.

1883
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,519
You out front, me in the shadows.

1884
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,629
We could run this town.

1885
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,199
Yeah, that's right,
I see you're curious.

1886
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,559
I'm gonna make you this offer
one time, one last time.

1887
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,350
What do you say?

1888
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,759
I'm Omar!

1889
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,479
Shut up! Would you please stop!

1890
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,959
Nobody believes you.

1891
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:31,500
Get over there.

1892
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,704
I'm gonna get with you later.
(WHIMPERS)

1893
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,039
Come on now.

1894
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,466
What's it gonna be?

1895
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:42,279
Get your goddamn hands off me.

1896
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,661
(SIGHS)

1897
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,469
Well, I tried to put the
man in the penthouse.

1898
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,159
He wants to spend his
life in the poorhouse.

1899
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,269
Guess we'll have to reinstate
the death penalty.

1900
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,159
You know what, Omar?
It really don't matter.

1901
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,759
You could smoke me right here,

1902
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,919
because we all gonna
die up in here anyway.

1903
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,745
- Oh, are we?
- SERBIAN BOSS: What are you talking about?

1904
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,391
You know what I'm talking about.

1905
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,919
Your boy Marko told me everything.

1906
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,319
It's a big setup.

1907
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,919
Them boxes right there,

1908
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,759
ain't nothing in
there but replicas.

1909
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:10,839
Not true.

1910
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,599
You ain't gonna like
how this movie end.

1911
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:15,380
You just walked into
your own assassination.

1912
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,823
We'll open the boxes and
find out, won't we?

1913
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:24,826
(SCREAMING)

1914
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,110
- Which way do I go?
- Right here.

1915
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,479
Yo, this is crazy, man!
This shit is crazy!

1916
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:41,350
- Calm down!
- I can't calm down!

1917
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:46,261
Holy shit! Oh, shit!

1918
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,039
James, I see a gun!

1919
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,341
Get it!

1920
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,026
(YELLS)

1921
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,785
Shit! I got it! I got it!

1922
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:04,799
Selective fire. Visual confirm
target. Short bursts.

1923
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,399
Just shoot! Come on, here we go.

1924
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,464
One, two, three, go!

1925
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,639
Shit!

1926
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:16,319
I thought it was the extended mags!
It's not the extended mags!

1927
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,463
What you talking about?

1928
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,159
Shit, I'm out.

1929
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,719
What the hell are you doing?

1930
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:24,319
In a game, you can pick
up ammo off the ground!

1931
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,239
This ain't no damn video game!

1932
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:28,622
Hold on! I got one!

1933
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,390
- Oh, God!
- Let's go!

1934
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,185
Same thing on the count of three.

1935
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,981
Watch out!

1936
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:41,746
I just saved your life!

1937
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,359
- Shit!
- I just saved your life!

1938
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:45,479
Shit.

1939
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:47,240
Save my life and get me
the hell out of here!

1940
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,900
(SCREAMING)

1941
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:52,479
Yo, we can't go that way.

1942
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,719
Why?

1943
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:55,679
Because they got
AK-47s down there.

1944
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:58,239
Two shotguns. They're
probably Benellis.

1945
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:00,279
From the sound of it,
it might be AR-15 as well.

1946
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,359
You can hear all that?

1947
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,439
It's from the game.

1948
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:05,039
I got a perfect recall.
I'm a Platinum level player.

1949
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,639
Here you go! Huh?
See how you like that!

1950
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,544
- Call me the perfect storm.
- Grenade!

1951
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:11,879
Hey, what you doing?

1952
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,839
You got five seconds to pick
it up and throw it back.

1953
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,187
Oh!

1954
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,026
(MEN SCREAMING)

1955
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,919
Stop throwing the
goddamn grenades!

1956
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:27,188
I already pulled the pin.

1957
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:29,021
Another one!

1958
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:35,239
James, the money.

1959
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:36,780
JAMES:
Ben! Get your ass back here!

1960
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,985
It's gonna blow!
Let's get out of here!

1961
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,786
Oh!

1962
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,839
- You all right?
- I'm good.

1963
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,141
Okay.

1964
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,427
That's it?

1965
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:02,061
That's not so bad. I thought it
was going to be bigger than that.

1966
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,759
Damn!

1967
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,266
My Car!

1968
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:25,239
It's probably still
drivable though,

1969
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:26,746
because it happened in the back.

1970
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,466
You can't drive it now.

1971
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,639
Yeah, it's definitely not
drivable. At first it was,

1972
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:38,307
but after this, there's
no way you can drive it.

1973
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,319
We have to get out
of here. Come on.

1974
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,119
You wanna get a cab, or what?

1975
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,785
- Let's go.
- Okay. All right.

1976
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,559
BEN: So, what was Omar going to
do with all those guns anyway?

1977
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:50,359
JAMES: Probably start an
army and take over the city.

1978
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,159
He's got half the
cops on his side.

1979
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,461
So, we stopped him?

1980
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,079
For now.

1981
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:56,519
- Hey.
- What?

1982
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,159
Slow down, man.

1983
01:18:58,160 --> 01:18:59,959
You see I got the money, right?

1984
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,039
Yeah, that was good.

1985
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,388
Hold this. My sock is wet.

1986
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,039
Must have stepped in
a puddle or something.

1987
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,751
Hate it when that happen.

1988
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,541
(GASPS) What is that?

1989
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,639
JAMES: Damn. You shot.

1990
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,959
I think I would be able
to feel if I got shot.

1991
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,959
You got so much adrenaline going
through you, you don't feel it.

1992
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,386
But I'm serious.

1993
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,919
- JAMES: Wow.
- BEN: What?

1994
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,301
It went straight through.

1995
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,999
Oh, my God!

1996
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,919
There's a hole in my leg!

1997
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,079
I got shot!

1998
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,279
Yeah I was pretty clear on that.

1999
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:32,959
Oh, shit! It hurts now!

2000
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,399
All right. Sit yourself
down. Sit down.

2001
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,439
I ain't gonna sit down!
I just got shot!

2002
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,105
I can't feel my toes!

2003
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,679
I can't feel my toes!

2004
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,266
Shh! Give me your belt.

2005
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,439
You gonna whip me
because I got shot?

2006
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,479
- Tourniquet!
- Okay.

2007
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,719
You have to get a cold piece
of meat like a steak.

2008
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,279
You have to put a
steak on it, man.

2009
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,820
- Listen!
- I'm listening.

2010
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:54,959
- I got shot!
- You're gonna be okay.

2011
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:57,759
You lost a little blood. Just
have to get you to a hospital.

2012
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,039
- Anybody down here?
- Calm down!

2013
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,119
All right, calm. I'm calm.

2014
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,024
(PHONE RINGING)
(CHATTER ON POLICE RADIO)

2015
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,821
(TURNS OFF)

2016
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,159
Yeah.

2017
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:08,399
Hey, Lieutenant, we
got a problem here.

2018
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,199
I'm aware. Make this easy
on us, James. Come on in.

2019
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,399
<i>Wait, what are you talking about?</i>

2020
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,759
Listen, Santiago and
Miggs, they dirty.

2021
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,427
(CHUCKLES) Funny, they're saying
the same thing about you.

2022
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:21,159
<i>They got Marko and his
buddy backing them up.</i>

2023
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,239
What?

2024
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,319
Hey! Tell him I got shot.

2025
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:24,719
- Shut up.
- Okay.

2026
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,399
Lieutenant, you gotta believe me,
it didn't go down like that.

2027
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,319
<i>You know I'm on your side.
Come in, James.</i>

2028
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,588
Just don't make it any worse.
Where are you?

2029
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,119
BEN: My foot, I think the
tourniquet too tight.

2030
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,279
We already at worse.

2031
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,661
Is the ambulance coming?

2032
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,431
- Is it coming?
- No.

2033
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,719
And we can't call one either.

2034
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,319
They'll be all over the scanners.

2035
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:43,951
What does that mean?

2036
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,465
It means I'm on my own.

2037
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,519
You're not on your own.

2038
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:49,901
You got me, man.

2039
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,959
Let's get you to a hospital.

2040
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:56,308
Okay. Oh, shit.

2041
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,583
Stop the car. Stop!

2042
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,439
Sorry to inform you, sir, but
I have to confiscate your vehicle.

2043
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:08,999
That's not even a real badge.

2044
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,399
I'm a police officer,

No, I'm not going

No. I'll see you at the office.

Actually, I didn't.

2319

You didn't see the look
that he just gave me?

2320
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,910
- No.
- That was a look of respect, James.

2321
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:47,839
I didn't even tell
you when they was

what I was doing.

2323
