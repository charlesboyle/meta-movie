00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,988
but Carl Denham's made
some interesting pictures.

170
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,354
He's had a lot of near-success.

171
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,860
He's a preening self-promoter.

172
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,226
An ambitious no-talent. The guy's got
"loser" written all over him.

Sure. Universal are desperate
for stock footage.

Mr. Denham.

183
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,026
I want the cast and crew
on the ship within the hour.

184
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,224
No, Carl, you can't do this.

185
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,460
Tell them the studio pressured
us into an early departure.

186
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,559
It's not ethical! What
are they gonna do, sue me?

187
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,729
They can get in line.

188
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,237
I'm not gonna let
them kill my film.

You realize that none of the camera
equipment is on board?

190
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,607
We have no permits, no visas.

He's there.

pay for the ship?

Get in.

You get out of there! Come here!

She pulled out?

209
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,986
Yesterday. I told you.

You said we were shooting
in Singapore, right?

Yeah, but we're not
shooting in Singapore.

was look her in the eye and lie.

And she can't escape the feeling
that forces beyond her control...

262
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:46,243
are compelling her down a road
from which she cannot draw back.

263
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:50,504
It's as if her whole life has
been a prelude to this moment...

264
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:56,253
this fateful meeting
that changes everything.

265
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,884
And sure enough, against her
better judgment...

266
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,650

Yes.

268

But she doesn't trust it.

269
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,700
She's not even sure
if she believes in love.

You're gonna break their hearts.

Jack Driscoll does not want just
anyone starring in this picture.

You got that?

<font color="#804040">JACK</font>: Okay, so she turns...

505
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,380
the first mate
is staggering towards her.

506
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,311
There's a knife sticking
out of his back.

507
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,321
Wait a sec. We're killing
off the first mate?

508
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,051
That's assuming she knows
who the first mate is.

509
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,958
Come on, Jack. It
was an honest mistake.

510
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,588
Ann is nearsighted. It could
have happened to anyone.

511
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,256
I was joking, Carl.

512
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:44,631
The point is, she's horrified.
She has to look away.

513
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,465
And that's when she sees it.

514
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:53,008
Sees what?

515
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,371
What?

516
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,284
The island.

517
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:10,393
We're filming on an island now?
When did this happen?

518
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,563
<font color="#808080">(SHUSHING)</font> Jack, keep
your voice down.

519
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,626
I don't want the crew
getting spooked.

520
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,227
Why would they get spooked?
What's it called?

521
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,330
All right. It has
a local name...

522
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,932
but I'm warning you, Jack,
it doesn't sound good.

523
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,705
<font color="#808080">(WHISPERS)</font> They call
it Skull Island.

524

00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,646
What's wrong with this place?

526
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:34,446
There's nothing
officially wrong with it.

527
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:38,019
Because, technically, it
hasn't been discovered yet.

528
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,393
Okay. All right.

529
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,859
So we arrive at this place.

530
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,659
S...

531
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,494

534
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:57,869
I...

535
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:04,713
Island.

536
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,114
All right, everyone, from the top!
And action!

537
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:17,354
I think this is awfully exciting!
I've never been on a ship before.

538
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,022
And I've never
been on one with a woman before.

539
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:23,556
I guess you don't think much
of women on ships, do you?

540
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,596
No, they're a nuisance.

541
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,333
Well, I'll try not to be.
Just being around is trouble.

542
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:38,673
Cut!

543
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,149
It's great.

544
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:45,517
Bruce, wonderful performance.
You can relax for 10 minutes.

545
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,491
That was very natural.
I felt moved.

546
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:52,118
What do you think, Driscoll?
Dialogue's got some flow now, huh?

547
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,027
It was pure effluence.

548
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,861
I beefed up the banter.

549
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,060
Try to resist that impulse.

550
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,364
It's just a little bit
of humor, bud.

551
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,906
What are you, a Bolshevik
or something?

552
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,168
Actors.

553
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:08,608
Travel the world, but all they ever
see is a mirror.

554
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:22,423
Good legs.

555
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,689
Sea legs. Well, you
know, sea legs.

556
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,291
Yeah.

557
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:33,997
Not that you don't have good legs.
Just making conversation.

558
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,370
Jesus. Miss Darrow!

559
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,867
About the scene today
with you and Bruce...

560
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,776
I know it wasn't
what you wrote...

561
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:46,874
but Mr. Baxter felt very strongly
that when a man likes a woman...

562
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,179
he must ignore her.

563
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,120
And if things turn
really hostile, then...

564
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,184
No?

565
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,987
Interesting theory.

566
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,719
I know. I should have...

567
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:01,093
It wasn't what I had
intended, but...

568
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,689
I'm sorry. I was...

569
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,758
And you made it your own.

570
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,226
I was nervous.

571
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:10,066
It was funny, actually.
You were funny.

572
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,306
Please don't say another word.
Good night.

573
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,776
Miss Darrow.

574
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,613
You don't have to be nervous.

575
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,488
Thank you.

576
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,020
Let's take it...

577
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,426
Would you please... We're
trying to shoot a scene.

578
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,124
Okay. Thank you.

579
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,658
Okay, again.

580
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,410
<font color="#804040">CARL</font>: We're close.
Turn southwest.

581
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,047
<font color="#804040">ENGLEHORN</font>: There's no land
southwest for thousands of miles.

582
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,514
It takes us way
outside the shipping lanes.

583
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,083
I won't sail blind
in these waters.

584
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:13,358
I'll make it worth your while.

585
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,690
There's nothing out there.

586
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,835
Well, then
you've nothing to lose.

587
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:35,841
If someone were to tell you this
ship was headed for Singapore...

588
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,050
what would you say?

589
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,920
I would say they're
full of it, Mr. Hayes.

590
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,419
Well, we turned
southwest last night.

591
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,292
Gentlemen, please.

592
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,225
We're not looking for trouble.
No.

593
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,971
You're looking
for something else.

594
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:00,742
Yes, we are.

595
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,779
We're going to find
Skull Island.

596
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:08,216
Find it, film it,
and show it to the world.

597
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,986
For 25 cents, you get to see
the last blank space on the map.

598
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,586
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

599
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,522
What do you mean?

600
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,858
Seven years ago, me and Mr. Hayes
were working our passage...

601
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,491
on a Norwegian bark.

602
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:27,401
We picked up a castaway.
We found him in the water.

603
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,503
He'd been drifting for days.

604
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:32,974
His ship had run aground
on an island way west of Sumatra.

605
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:36,502
An island hidden in fog.

606
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,546
He spoke of a huge wall...

607
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,582
built so long ago...

608
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,113
no one knew who'd made it.

609
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:49,258
A wall 100 foot high...

610
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,360
as strong today
as it was ages ago.

611
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:56,122
Why'd they build the wall?

612
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:04,234
Well, the castaway,
he spoke of a creature...

613
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,768
neither beast nor man...

614
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,543
but something monstrous,
living behind that wall.

615
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:12,942
A lion or a tiger.

616
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:16,216
A man-eater. That's how all these
stories start.

617
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,084
What else did he say?

618
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:19,548
Nothing.

619
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:22,387
We found him the next morning.
He'd stuck a knife through his heart.
