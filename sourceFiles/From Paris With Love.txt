1
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,036
- Thank you, Cindy.
- Welcome.

2
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,957
African Aid Summit prep meeting with
the Foreign Minister tomorrow at noon,

3
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,458
Summit conference on Wednesday,

4
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:50,086
G8 Undersecretary conference dinner
on Thursday,

5
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,839
and a reception for
the Secretary of State on Friday, sir.

6
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:56,717
Can't you see we have
more urgent matters to consider, Reese?

7
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,637
Of course, sir.

8
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:02,682
Check.

9
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,976
Must you always be so methodical?

10
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,602
Well, that's what you pay me for, sir.

11
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,813
And you're worth every penny.

12
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,274
But that doesn't mean
I'm just gonna sit here

13
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:15,778
and watch you copy Fischer's ambush
on Spassky back in '72.

14
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,700
- Yeah?
- Parking lot.

15
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:25,997
Number 17, Rue Lescot, seventh section.
Silver, Series 5 BMW, same as before.

16
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,123
Yes.

17
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,802
- Checkmate, sir.
- What?

18
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,262
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

19
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,722
Excuse me, sir. They need me downstairs

20
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,390
to review the Summit seating chart
with security.

21
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,766
Yeah, well, as long as you make sure

22
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,852
that I am seated
next to the Foreign Minister.

23
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,896
- Of course, sir.
- By the way,

24
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,857
you ever find out which of those
two secretaries he's banging,

25
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,026
the brunette or the blond?

26
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,361
I'm afraid both, sir.

27
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,491
God, I love the French.

28
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,504
Hello.

29
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,631
Good work, Reese.

30
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,925
Thank you, sir.

31
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,512
You know, if you gave me the chance,
I could do so much more.

32
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:14,308
I was thinking... I mean,

33
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,603
have you received
my application for A-4 training?

34
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,897
You'll get your shot at Special Ops, Reese.

35
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,901
But, right now, I need you to secure a chip
in the Foreign Minister's conference room

36
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,695
during tomorrow's meeting
with the Ambassador.

37
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,697
Will that be a problem?

38
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,743
No problem at all, sir.
Except I don't have the chip.

39
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,078
Really?

40
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,956
I was told you've had it all afternoon.

41
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,500
No, I'm quite sure I don't.

42
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:40,876
Hold on.

43
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,256
Left jacket pocket.

44
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,536
Hi.

45
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:20,040
Did you save the world today, James?

46
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,209
If only you knew, Caroline.

47
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,887
Then tell me, what did you do?

48
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,390
You know I can't go into details.

49
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,353
Not yet.

50
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:56,493
All right then.
What do you think about this?

51
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,089
I think wow.

52
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,720
- You like the fabric?
- I love it.

53
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:18,265
- Looks kind of familiar, though.
- It should.

54
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,601
They're our bedroom curtains.

55
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:27,983
All right.

56
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,160
- So, what are we eating for dinner?
- Wait a second.

57
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,579
Isn't it part of French tradition
that the woman cooks

58
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,039
while the guy watches TV?

59
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:46,043
Well, things have changed
since the Middle Ages, you know.

60
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,462
Now it's exactly the contrary.

61
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:52,633
Why don't we skip dinner altogether
and go straight to dessert?

62
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,220
Is this all you can think about?

63
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,305
Every second of the day.

64
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,724
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Reese.

65
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,225
Here's your topic list for today.

66
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,894
I've highlighted the three-point shots.
The rest are mostly lay-ups.

67
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,814
Well done, Reese.
You heading back to the office right away?

68
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,524
Do you mind if I stay and wait for you, sir?

69
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,818
No. Why don't you join us for the meeting?

70
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:56,822
Thank you, sir.

71
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,742
- FranÃ§ois.
- Thomas.

72
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,328
As I mentioned at our previous meeting,

73
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:06,332
the President is extremely pleased
with the way your cabinet

74
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:11,086
and the state department have come up
with a mutual agreement on our policy

75
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,838
concerning the African continent.

76
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,466
- Gum?
- However, we believe

77
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,927
that it would make a big difference
if France and the United States

78
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:23,640
could release a common statement
on the position of our two countries

79
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,769
concerning the terms and conditions
of the reduction...

80
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,856
We're also very pleased, Thomas.

81
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,232
Cough drop?

82
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,072
I think that rather than making
a precise statement

83
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,949
on the specific figures of the African debt,

84
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,118
we should express our understanding

85
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,746
of the necessity of a substantial reduction
of the debt,

86
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,456
so they don't sink any deeper.

87
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,046
You know, I believe that this statement
will be seen by the international community

88
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,508
as a sign of our mutual support
on this matter.

89
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:00,594
You're absolutely right.
Anyway, we'll have plenty of time to...

90
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,429
- Excuse me, Minister.
- Yes?

91
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,682
Is it true that you recently acquired
several Goyas?

92
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,268
Really? I would love to see them.

93
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,396
Actually, they're on loan from the Prado.

94
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,315
They're absolutely remarkable.
You must see them.

95
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,693
You know, we have several Goyas
in New York at the Frick Museum.

96
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,070
Have you?

97
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:52,956
Caroline?

98
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,715
James!

99
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,095
I'm sorry, I spilled most of the sauce.

100
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,723
The sauce.

101
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,560
You made dinner?

102
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,231
Don't worry, I didn't cook. It's take-out.

103
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,570
I have a gift for you.

104
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,490
- I forgot, didn't I?
- No, no, no.

105
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,493
You haven't forgotten anything.
Just... Just open it.

106
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:38,835
Hello?

107
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,090
Planting a mike in the Minister's
private office, very impressive, Reese.

108
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,718
Thank you, sir. Anything I can do to help.

109
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:51,557
I appreciate that, which is why I'm giving
you this next job on such short notice.

110
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,183
I'm ready. When?

111
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:56,228
Tonight. Be at the airport
as soon as you can.

112
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,729
You know I haven't been briefed.

113
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,773
Your partner's being held
by the French customs.

114
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,024
I need you to get him out of there.

115
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,442
My partner?

116
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:03,944
Charlie Wax.

117
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:05,821
Right now?

118
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,864
Is there some problem? You're busy?

119
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,118
Thank you. No, no, no. Not at all.

120
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,747
Sir, you do realize
that I'm not Special Ops certified.

121
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:20,085
I'm a man short, Reese.
Besides, it's mostly driving Wax around.

122
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,755
Nail this job and consider yourself
a member of the club.

123
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,641
It's the promotion.

124
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,685
That's wonderful.

125
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,398
So it means we have
two things to celebrate tonight.

126
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,984
Two things to celebrate? What else?

127
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,381
It was my father's.

128
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:14,306
If I waited for you to ask,
it would never happen.

129
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,194
I love you.

130
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,622
Promise me you'll never take it off.

131
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,082
I promise.

132
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,919
You sure you want to marry a guy
in my line of work?

133
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:49,341
Who else is going to sew the bullet holes
in your coat if you get shot?

134
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,182
- I'll be here waiting.
- You better.

135
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,102
Wait, one more kiss.

136
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,771
Don't get me started, my partner's waiting.

137
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,649
Just remember who your partner really is.

138
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,259
Is that the man you're looking for?

139
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,470
You don't serve energy drinks in Paris?

140
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,473
It's for working out.
It's for getting over jetlag.

141
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,892
You're sure this is Charlie Wax?

142
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,648
Take him off our hands
before we lock him up.

143
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:50,110
Without the cans.
He can't bring in the cans.

144
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,863
You ever have that? Look.

145
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,824
Look, here.
It's corn syrup, caffeine and water.

146
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,410
And a cool label. That's all it is.

147
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,373
- Try it.
- It will never enter France.

148
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,586
Well, that's all we got here, motherfucker.

149
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,296
Motherfucker?

150
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,675
Don't get your panties up in a bunch
just because I used the M-word

151
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,011
as an adjective, as in,
"When I landed at this airport,

152
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:20,807
"I was confronted by a self-important
American-hating, frog leg eating,

153
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:23,643
"snail sucking, motherfucking,
cock sucking bureaucrat."

154
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,812
'Cause I'd rather use it as a noun, as in,

155
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:28,190
"This motherfucker
hates Americans so much

156
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:32,736
"even though we saved his country's ass
in not only one World War but two,

157
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,572
"he still won't let me through
with my cans."

158
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,909
So now that we're clear
on how I use the M-word,

159
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:42,579
with no disrespect to you
or your official capacity

160
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:46,875
as the guardian of your country's borders,
I'll just move on with my cans.

161
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,630
It will never enter France, okay?

162
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,340
Well, how am I supposed
to have the energy

163
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:57,093
to enjoy the endless pleasures
of your fine city?

164
00:18:57,178 --> 00:19:00,847
We can get you a few shots of espresso
on the way out instead, sir.

165
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,979
It is very important that you clear customs.

166
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,856
Not without my cans.

167
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,321
Can I talk to you for a minute?

168
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,076
They got a real problem with those cans.

169
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,745
So it seems. I'm running late.
You know this place?

170
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,622
Yeah. There is better Chinese food in town.

171
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,499
Yeah. Well, I hear
they make a killer egg foo yung.

172
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,293
So slip this guy some bills
and let's get me over there.

173
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,462
That's not how we do things here, sir.

174
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,130
Well, that's how I do things.

175
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,383
Why don't you call the Embassy
and get me a different driver

176
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,635
who will comply to the way I do things?

177
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,679
I'm not your driver.

178
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,056
- I'm your partner.
- Yeah, you're the chess player.

179
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,766
I read your file.

180
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:48,395
- You play?
- Do I look like I play board games?

181
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,857
So, why don't you get this guy laid,

182
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,526
get him a box of Cohibas,
a bottle of Chivas, do whatever it takes.

183
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,278
Just get it done.

184
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,072
Why don't I try something
just a little more subtle?

185
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,087
Checkmate, motherfucker.

186
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,804
You know, that really wasn't necessary
back there.

187
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:26,391
Yeah, I know. I just like to stick it to
these self-righteous little pricks.

188
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,060
Think just because
they got a badge and a uniform,

189
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,813
they can lord over us civilians
any time the mood strikes them.

190
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,065
And you know we can probably
get that drink in any supermarket.

191
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,400
Yeah. I know that, too.

192
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,986
So what's the big deal over some
corn syrup, caffeine and water?

193
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,822
Well, the big deal is my secret ingredient,

194
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:44,784
which I could not take the chance
that they would find out about.

195
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,708
Hence, the diversionary tactics of the
grammatical variation of "motherfucker."

196
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:55,921
- You mean everything back there was...
- You didn't get that?

197
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,300
You know I'm authorized to get you
any weapon you want.

198
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,177
Yeah, but not like this one.

199
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,430
Because me and Mrs. Jones...

200
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:13,563
Till death do us part.

201
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
No gravy.

202
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,296
Leave it to the French to fuck up
China's number one dish.

203
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:41,174
- It's not Chinese, it's American.
- Bullshit.

204
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,218
It was invented by a Jewish guy
in San Francisco.

205
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,928
- Bullshit again.
- I'm telling you the truth.

206
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,430
There's nothing Chinese about it.
Not even the name.

207
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,891
Foo yung has got nothing to do
with what's in that dish.

208
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:54,062
So you're not only a chess master,
you're a Chinese language specialist.

209
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,106
Level two Mandarin
at Cambridge night school.

210
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,192
- Really?
- And the Chinese word for egg is dan.

211
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:04,531
Excuse me. Sir?

212
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,242
Yes, sir.

213
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,787
How do you say "egg" in Chinese?

214
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,039
I'm sorry. I am fourth generation.

215
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:15,375
I am born in Brussels.
I don't speak Chinese.

216
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,003
Hey, take it easy.
The guy said he doesn't speak Chinese.

217
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,421
Maybe this is something he does speak.

218
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,631
What the fuck, Wax?
The guy is just a waiter.

219
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:24,300
Well, if he's our waiter,
he can help us order dessert, can't he?

220
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,636
I was looking for a Pakistani-Chinese dish.

221
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:28,972
No dessert. Just fortune cookies.

222
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,932
Well, let's order off the menu then.

223
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,851
CrÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e from patisserie,
just across the street.

224
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,061
No, no. I'm more in the mood
for something you sniff off a spoon,

225
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,896
something you buy by the kilo.

226
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,399
You good?

227
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,320
- Let's just get out of here.
- Did I say we were done?

228
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,655
Look, if you really want to score some coke,

229
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,491
I'm sure I can find someone someplace else.

230
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,367
We're not going anywhere.
Where's the blow?

231
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:32,660
No blow.

232
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,122
Where's the blow?

233
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,125
No blow.

234
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,810
Empty that vase
and collect some of that shit.

235
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:06,319
Do you ever notice the closer you get
to the people who cook the shit,

236
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,071
the better it tastes?

237
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,073
And from the taste of it,
we're about two people removed

238
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,493
from the chef who's got the recipe
for this very fine product.

239
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,995
Listen, you tell whoever you work for

240
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,581
I didn't kill you
because I got a message for him.

241
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,917
Wax on, wax off.

242
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,462
Come on, pard.

243
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,509
Reese, keys. Come on.

244
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,183
Hey, hey, Wax.

245
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,294
"Wax on, wax off."

246
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,423
- What about it?
- I don't get it.

247
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,717
What are you,
The Karate Kid or something?

248
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:15,013
If you wanna be a secret agent man,
you have to roll like a secret agent man.

249
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,806
- It's code.
- Code?

250
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:20,476
Yeah. Code.
Wax is on, he's gonna take you off.

251
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:25,857
Gives them something to think about.
Throws them off balance.

252
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:29,903
Got it?

253
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,071
- Got it.
- Good.

254
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,768
And what about this? Evidence?

255
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,519
Evidence, my ass.

256
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,188
Where we're heading,
that's better than cash.

257
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,440
As long as it's all official business, right?

258
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:11,277
Well, if you knew this college girl
named Charlotte...

259
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,572
- Charlotte?
- Yeah.

260
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:16,282
Scored some shit
at that Chinese restaurant.

261
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,868
Next thing you know, she's overdosing.

262
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:21,996
You got me riding along on some
personal, off-the-book job?

263
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,373
Fuck, yeah, it's personal.

264
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:26,000
Trying to take advantage of some kid
who just wants to party.

265
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:29,879
Look, I'm sorry about your friend,
Charlotte, whoever she is,

266
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:33,049
but if this isn't about national security,
I'm not going along with this.

267
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,386
It is when
she's the Secretary of Defense's niece.

268
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,058
And the Secretary of Defense wants us
to shut these guys down, right?

269
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,811
Whole operation. Top to bottom.
Chef to chief.

270
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,021
You got a problem with that?

271
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:49,983
- No.
- Good.

272
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:26,352
- Hey, hey. Yo, you can't park here.
- Well, I just did.

273
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,522
Come on, muscle you up, pard.

274
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:39,949
- Hey, there's a secret code, let me just...
- No, let me. I'm really good at guessing.

275
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:41,409
There's a 9mm and two clips.

276
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,871
Well, I prefer sending my partners in
a little heavier.

277
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:48,041
So I would skip the Glocks
and go with this.357.

278
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,044
It's got a smoke trail better than a Cohiba.

279
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,092
- Shit.
- Yeah, just use your Cambridge level two.

280
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,136
Tell them we ain't interested
in what they're selling.

281
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,471
These are Dragon Heads.

282
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:04,223
I think we should just buy what
they're selling and get the hell out of here.

283
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,726
Man, I just gave you a straight up

284
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,855
Hong-Kong-Shaw-Brothers-kung-fu
motherfucking-chop-suey show

285
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,107
and you're worried about
this candy ass street gang?

286
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,401
- That was against kitchen staff.
- Kitchen staff?

287
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:19,364
They're no kitchen staff shedding lead
like that. No kitchen staff, hoss.

288
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:23,284
Well, maybe not. But these guys
look like they're gonna make those guys

289
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,161
look like choirboys.

290
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,039
Well, they're no LA Maravilla gang.

291
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,375
Just some Asian dudes.

292
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:34,170
We're cool with the Asian dudes.
Am I right, brother?

293
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:38,758
Wrong, brother.

294
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,677
Shit.

295
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:07,787
Now tell me
that wasn't some impressive shit.

296
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,831
Kitchen staff.

297
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,499
Stay one floor below me.
I don't want these guys crawling up my ass.

298
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:54,834
Got it.

299
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:18,292
How many more of them
do you think there are?

300
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,586
Last census, about a billion.

301
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,001
- Translate for me.
- Okay.

302
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:06,173
I have an address book with every dealer,
pimp and prostitute in your network.

303
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:15,850
One call and the next party you have will
be catered off a park bench in Beijing.

304
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,109
But you can keep this all,

305
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:32,158
you just have to give me the address
of the man who delivers all your cocaine.

306
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:39,624
You have 20 seconds
or you won't have another chance.

307
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,930
Get out of the way. Go.

308
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,265
What do you got?

309
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,058
- Two, three guys.
- Go. Go, go, go.

310
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,546
Cover me.

311
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:26,016
Just remember, yesterday,
you were unscrewing license plates,

312
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,310
now we've got you working
with our top operative.

313
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,104
- Isn't that what you wanted?
- Yes, sir.

314
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,480
And I appreciate the confidence,

315
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:35,776
but don't you think Wax's methods
aren't exactly...

316
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:36,986
What?

317
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,280
He's got me walking around
with a vase full of coke, sir.

318
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,657
I'll admit his playbook's a bit unorthodox,

319
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,534
but Wax always gets it done.

320
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,078
- I understand, but don't you think...
- Stop thinking, Reese.

321
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,414
Just do exactly what Wax says.

322
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,251
So, we're cool.

323
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:55,212
This is all official business, right?

324
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:58,007
- From the King on down.
- Thank you, sir.

325
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,468
- I just wanted to make sure. And as I said...
- Reese, do not call me again.

326
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,679
Not until this job is done.

327
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,524
Caroline.

328
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:18,444
Caroline. I'm sorry. I meant to call you.

329
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:20,613
You just disappeared. Where are you?

330
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,948
Caroline. Caroline.

331
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:29,788
Reese, let's go.

332
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:33,959
We got some time to pep up
before we go to Mr. Wong's drug dealer.

333
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,630
Hey, do you think they serve breakfast
up there in the Eiffel Tower?

334
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,887
Will you leave your cell phone
for a second?

335
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,890
I just need to make this one call, okay?

336
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,644
Calling your girl ain't going to
get you home any quicker.

337
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,354
You don't have anybody
to go home to, do you?

338
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,856
I thought you already met my wife.

339
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,360
If you met Caroline,
you might feel a little different.

340
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:02,029
I woke up with my share of Carolines.

341
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,991
- She's no ordinary girl, Wax.
- They never are.

342
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:09,328
Come on. Come on.

343
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,464
Try this shit here. Go ahead.

344
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,424
Hey, I thought this wasn't about
you scoring coke?

345
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:24,927
It's not.
It's about smoothing over some edges

346
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,887
so we can make it home alive.

347
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,931
Wouldn't you rather one of us
actually had his wits about him?

348
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:33,102
I would rather not get shot because
someone spotted you as an embassy gofer.

349
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:37,523
Well, that's your problem,
'cause I'm not sticking that shit up my nose.

350
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,692
You enjoy your walk home, okay?

351
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:43,946
Maybe you could flip my license plates
the next time I come to town.

352
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:56,959
Good. All right. Now maybe
you will be in that car with me.

353
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,711
Turn around. Exit.

354
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,134
This is not the same stuff the
Secretary of Defense's niece snorted, right?

355
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:08,220
This blow, that blow, it's all blow.

356
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,848
Yeah, but the blow that she took
gave her cardiac arrest.

357
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:14,309
Yeah, well, if we were taking that shit,
we'd be foaming at the mouth.

358
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,939
Wake up. It's never been about the coke.

359
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:23,068
What about Charlotte?
The Secretary of Defense's niece?

360
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,654
Are you high? There ain't no niece.

361
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:33,287
Man, that shit is strong. You might be
feeling some side effects by now.

362
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,247
Wax. Wax. What the fuck?

363
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,874
You're still on this ride with me.

364
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,376
I don't know where the fuck we're going,
or what the fuck this is about.

365
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:42,671
What the fuck do you think this is about?
It's about terrorists.

366
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:46,216
It's about terrorists, man,
converting their finances into drugs

367
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,844
so they can move it around
without being detected.

368
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:53,515
It's about buying any type of explosive
which can strike anyone, anywhere.

369
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,518
Women, kids, cats, dogs, you name it.

370
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:57,978
Terrorists?

371
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,315
Shit. Fuck.

372
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,448
That's our guy.

373
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,368
Act the part, like you're some drug addict.

374
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,339
Is that the guy you're gonna kill?

375
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,007
I didn't say I was gonna kill him.

376
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:29,259
- Just tell him we want to party.
- Party?

377
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:32,429
Yeah, tell him we want
two big-titted chicks in that building.

378
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,474
Go ahead and tell him.

379
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,730
And you? You like to watch?

380
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:06,171
Enjoy. They're ribbed.
I got them off a Swede in Thailand.

381
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,842
- What about the pimp?
- Go for it. Whatever gets you off.

382
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,760
How about I get off this elevator?

383
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:14,513
James?

384
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,266
Caroline. Caroline. Caroline.

385
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:19,017
How am I gonna explain this, Wax?

386
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:21,311
I thought that was the cool thing
about French chicks.

387
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,689
They're not as uptight as American girls.

388
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:26,650
Well, she's not very French like that, Wax.
And she's definitely gonna wanna know

389
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,903
what I was doing in that elevator
with you and her.

390
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,196
Yeah, well, maybe
you should be asking her

391
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:33,198
what she was doing in this part of town.

392
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:36,201
She was buying fabric.
She makes her own clothes.

393
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:38,245
What am I supposed to do now?
I'm totally fucked.

394
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,748
Well, not after I tell her how you pulled
the trigger and saved the day.

395
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,751
You think I'm just gonna stand here
and lose my girl while you get laid?

396
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,171
Haven't you learned anything since we met?

397
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,343
Move. Move.

398
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:03,020
Yeah. That's the big boss shit
I'm looking for.

399
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,155
What the fuck are you doing, man?

400
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,867
What the fuck does it look like I'm doing?
I'm charging my fucking cell.

401
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:24,541
But when you're done, why don't you
check out the bank our friends are using

402
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:27,336
- to launder their drug money?
- What am I looking for?

403
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,339
You're looking for a Pakistani
with a big bag of coke

404
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:33,675
or a raghead pushing a wheel cart
filled with cash.

405
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,724
Unbelievable.

406
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,856
I swear. What you saw
was nothing like what it seemed.

407
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:50,609
Well, it seemed like my fiancÃ©
was riding up an elevator

408
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,653
with some hooker and her pimp.

409
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:56,240
Yes, she is a hooker,
and no, that guy is not her pimp.

410
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,408
Who the hell is he then? Tell me.

411
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:01,912
You know I can't discuss my work.

412
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,665
Well, you should probably
make an exception this time, James.

413
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:13,257
It's this crazy partner
they got me working with, okay?

414
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,509
What? The pimp's your partner?

415
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,636
He didn't exactly
look the embassy type to me.

416
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,056
He's not. They flew him in
specifically for this one job.

417
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,017
Well, I don't like you leaving me
to work with guys like him.

418
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:25,852
Caroline, I don't like it either.

419
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,813
Then stop doing
whatever it is you're doing.

420
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:31,483
Bring your friend for dinner if you want.
But please come home.

421
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:32,985
Open the door.

422
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,030
I'm gonna have to call you back, okay?

423
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:38,198
Open the door now!

424
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:41,410
God, I love this country.
Any back door action on this side?

425
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:42,619
Yeah, what about the front door?

426
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:45,664
It's probably that Pakistani pimp.
Kill the fucker.

427
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,249
I'm not gonna kill the guy, Wax.

428
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,847
Halle-fucking-lujah, we got customers.

429
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:20,407
The next time I tell you to shoot the fucker,
shoot the fucker.

430
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:43,972
Hey, Reese.

431
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,225
You like shopping?

432
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:51,146
Come on, Wax.
Let's just finish the job and go home, okay?

433
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,816
And miss out on the finer things
that Paris has to offer?

434
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,443
What?

435
00:44:56,569 --> 00:45:00,572
After all the shit that we've been through,
you're just going to let them walk?

436
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,449
No worries.

437
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,993
We're just handing them off
to the eye in the sky.

438
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,914
Request level one
satellite visual surveillance.

439
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:12,459
NSA Eagle Eye One track sat reassignment
protocol for satellite repositioning.

440
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,002
Sending target coordinates package.

441
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:16,004
Eagle Eye, confirming visual identification.

442
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:18,256
Target has parked,
passengers have entered the building.

443
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,926
Transferring current location to agent
for target recovery.

444
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,608
They didn't mention this dump
in my Parisian guide book.

445
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,236
Why should the dumps here be
any different to the dumps back home?

446
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,532
I just figure in Paris and all, you know,
shitholes should be nicer.

447
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,911
But I can dig it, though.
Brings me back to the day.

448
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,204
Yeah?

449
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,790
I don't remember them
being particularly happy days.

450
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:54,876
Now, see, I would have figured you
for a Cambridge man all the way.

451
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,003
Cypress Houses, East New York.

452
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:59,005
No shit. Really?

453
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,549
You didn't get out much, did you?

454
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:04,886
Not really. I was the only kid
to make it off my block alive, though.

455
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:07,097
I wish someone would've locked me up.

456
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,434
Always wondered about guys like you,
all locked up in apartments,

457
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:11,935
reading and shit.

458
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:15,355
- Mostly watching Star Trek.
- Star Trek.

459
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,399
Dreaming of getting out.

460
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,025
Kirk or Spock?

461
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:20,986
Uhura.

462
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:24,072
Here we go.

463
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,963
My friend and I are looking
to get beamed inside.

464
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,466
Yeah, lots ofAmerican dollar.

465
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,698
Wait with them. I'll get Rashid.

466
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:10,160
Don't look that one in the eye.

467
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:17,834
He told you not to look that one in the eye.

468
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:19,503
I couldn't help it. I was curious.

469
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:22,756
And they want us
to get down on the ground.

470
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,592
What the hell are you doing?

471
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,094
Let me give you a little advice
I picked up in Somalia.

472
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,472
When a shaky 10-year-old
points a gun in your face,

473
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,432
you do whatever the fuck he wants.
Now, get down here.

474
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:34,726
They just want our bling.

475
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,065
- You feeling homesick, yet?
- Fuck, no. It's fake.

476
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,026
Well, this isn't.
Caroline's father gave it to her.

477
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,571
Oh, man,
I swear that girl's gonna get you killed.

478
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,967
Looks better on me?

479
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:08,927
- Definitely.
- Thank you.

480
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,431
For you, $50.

481
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:20,397
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

482
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:24,150
That's good shit. It's the Colombian
mixed with a little flour, right?

483
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:25,777
All right, give me a kilo.

484
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,363
A kilo? You think this is BogotÃ¡?

485
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,906
What the fuck am I gonna do
with five grams?

486
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:33,368
Maybe you can sniff it
off of your homeboy's ass.

487
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,457
And maybe you can get off yourjive ass

488
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:43,044
and hook me up with a player
who can hook us up.

489
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:45,797
Five grams
is considered personal consumption,

490
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,507
that they can get away with.

491
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:50,719
Anything more than a kilo
is 15 years in prison.

492
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:52,512
Well, wouldn't it be a shame
for these motherfuckers

493
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:55,682
to get caught with five kilos
of their own shit?

494
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:59,311
Got caught with five kilos of their own shit.

495
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,449
Thank you.

496
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,288
- Give me the fucking ring. Give me the ring.
- Yeah, yeah.

497
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,333
- Give me the fucking ring.
- That's it. That's it.

498
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,711
Give me back my fucking ring.

499
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,505
Tell us where the Pakistanis are
or I'll have him take you for another round.

500
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:30,967
Give it to me.
Get that fucking ring off your finger.

501
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,555
Yeah, boy.

502
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:40,852
This better be the apartment
right over where the Pakistanis are staying

503
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:43,938
or you're gonna be...
What's the math on him?

504
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,942
He's gonna be, like, the 26th guy
in the last 24 hours.

505
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:51,237
- Hey, that's about a guy an hour.
- All adds up. Go.

506
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:05,126
Relax, old man, we're not gonna hurt you.

507
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:06,628
We'll be gone in five minutes.

508
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:10,006
Why should I worry?
At my age, there's nothing to worry about.

509
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:13,968
With the world we left you,
you are the ones who should be worried.

510
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:17,222
- Mint tea?
- Why the hell not?

511
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:19,307
You think it was that different
back in your day?

512
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:21,726
It is just as evil for certain.

513
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:25,063
But it is a lot less polite.

514
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:30,151
Okay, Rashid.

515
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:34,239
Let's see what kind of trouble
your buddies are brewing up down there.

516
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:35,573
Sit down.

517
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:47,210
- How's it look?
- Looks like they're closing up shop.

518
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:50,880
Okay.
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

519
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:53,800
I'm gonna take the scenic route,

520
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:57,721
and you, my friend,
are gonna go downstairs to the 10th floor,

521
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:00,682
and shoot anybody
who comes through that door.

522
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,017
You're gonna need this to keep in touch.

523
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:05,186
Thanks.

524
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:11,276
- That's good shit. How do I get some?
- You can't. It's homegrown nana.

525
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,446
All right.
Thanks for your hospitality, old man.

526
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:16,656
Let's go.

527
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:46,019
- Are you in position?
- Yeah. You want me inside?

528
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,315
Hell, no.

529
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:53,735
They got the door wired.

530
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,595
They're going down to the ninth floor,
cut them off.

531
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:21,721
Got it.

532
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:36,361
Hey, hey, freeze. Fuck. Freeze.
Get the fuck down! Get down! Down!

533
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:39,030
Get down!

534
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:47,831
No.

535
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,346
Nice work, Reese.

536
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,598
What's so nice about it?

537
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:09,352
How about the fact that he's dead
and you're alive? How many got out?

538
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:12,105
Two, maybe three.
You're not gonna catch them now, Wax.

539
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,827
How much time you think it would take
to run down nine floors of stairs?

540
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:26,995
I have no idea, Wax.

541
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:29,831
I think about six seconds a floor,
that sound right?

542
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,249
Yeah, sure.

543
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,751
That'll take 54 seconds

544
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:36,045
to get down there.

545
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:52,604
And five seconds to cross the lobby.

546
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,650
And four seconds to get to the car.

547
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:14,626
And then there was none.

548
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:24,218
The cops will be here soon.

549
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:27,764
Damn, this place is dripping with intel.
Come on, help.

550
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,937
Come on.

551
00:55:29,243 --> 00:55:31,911
- Hey, Reese?
- We need to get out of here, Wax.

552
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:34,080
Get in here. Check this out.

553
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,999
I don't want anything more to do
with this place, Wax.

554
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:39,043
Well, you got more to do with this
than you think.

555
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:53,141
- What the fuck?
- Yeah, that's what I was wondering.

556
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:55,143
Why, you suddenly run out
of explanations?

557
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:56,519
You don't know where this is heading?

558
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:59,814
Fuck, no. I just follow the bouncing ball.
Right now, that leads to you.

559
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,441
Hey, I got nothing to do with this, Wax.

560
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:04,235
Well, that's not what the evidence tells us.

561
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,446
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

562
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:14,996
They're heading to the 10th floor.

563
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:18,082
The door's rigged.
They'll be blown to pieces.

564
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,001
That's not a fucking option we've got.

565
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,711
You go out there and drag us into it,
it's over.

566
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,296
They're just a bunch of cops
doing theirjobs.

567
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,965
If we don't finish ourjob,
thousands of people will get killed.

568
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,633
- You got that?
- That's the point.

569
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,427
We're supposed to protect people,
not let them die.

570
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:31,763
It's not the fucking time for a body count.
It's too late.

571
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:33,264
It's not too late for them.

572
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:47,737
- Reese?
- Yeah.

573
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,115
Get up.

574
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:14,764
Reese, police car, get in.

575
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,400
Wait, wait, wait, stop. I gotta get my stuff.

576
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:28,236
They knew we were coming,
I'm sure it's stripped by now.

577
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,321
Look. My prints are all over that car.

578
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:34,158
The cops will trace it back to the Embassy
and to me in no time.

579
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:37,829
- Fuck.
- Okay, let me get my head around this.

580
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:39,664
You wanna stop
in the middle of our getaway

581
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:43,251
so you can grab your plates,
wipe your prints and grab some files?

582
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:45,378
- I'll be quick.
- Quicker than this?

583
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,967
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck.

584
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:01,435
- What the fuck, Wax?
- Ka-fucking-boom.

585
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,271
Work for you?

586
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:04,689
You're fucking crazy.

587
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:20,037
You did good today, Reese.
Helped save the world a little bit.

588
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:27,253
Why don't you have a seat here
and reflect on our eventful day?

589
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:30,673
I'm gonna go shoot the shit
with these trench coats.

590
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:49,901
Goodbye, Wax.

591
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:55,281
What's the deal with the bag?

592
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:00,328
What I got in this bag
is gonna get me killed one day.

593
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:02,955
You look pretty bullet-proof to me.

594
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,125
Reese, every man's got his vices.

595
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:11,380
In my case, locals here call my vice
a Royale with cheese.

596
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,850
So the job's finished? We can go home?

597
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:26,395
Not until the trench coats call us
and tell us we can.

598
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:31,817
What if it's never over, Wax?
What if we can't beat these guys?

599
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:35,988
Why don't you ask the guy you shot
what it feels like to win?

600
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:42,870
I didn't shoot him.
I couldn't pull the trigger.

601
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,374
I know you didn't.

602
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:49,377
But it's okay. It's not going in the report.

603
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,004
Well, maybe it should.

604
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:54,173
Maybe I'm just not cut out
for this sort of work.

605
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:58,386
No, that's exactly why you need
to stay in it, keep guys like me honest.

606
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,346
You don't need me, Wax.

607
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:04,475
Are you fucking kidding?
Tell me we're not a perfect match.

608
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,155
Dinner?

609
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:22,493
Why the hell not?

610
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:33,087
Hey, I brought my friend Charles for dinner.

611
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:35,673
- Hi. James.
- Hi, Nichole.

612
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:40,678
Thank you.

613
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:44,473
- Where have you been all day?
- I'm so sorry...

614
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:46,058
So, you got to tell me something.

615
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:50,438
What do you do when you're not busy
making men's jaws drop?

616
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:53,232
That might work on the girls
in the red light district.

617
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:56,319
So, what the hell were you thinking
taking Reese to some hooker?

618
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:58,070
You didn't know
they got engaged last night?

619
01:00:58,155 --> 01:00:59,196
Sure.

620
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:00,614
- What's that?
- Talked about it all day.

621
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:03,451
I just had to go pick up a fabric shipment.

622
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:06,203
I'm a rag importer,
we got a little business on the side.

623
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:10,166
But, you know, I spend most of my money
on cars and women.

624
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:14,587
- Not in that order I hope.
- Excuse me. Yeah?

625
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,839
- Let me go change.
- Okay.

626
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:18,382
Hold on.

627
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,563
Yeah, I'm listening.

628
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:36,150
Really? Well, how many numbers you got?

629
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:39,236
Call them all back.

630
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:42,656
All right, so, where were we?

631
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:45,493
You were telling my friend what fabric
you and my fiancÃ© were picking up

632
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:47,078
when I saw you.

633
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:50,956
Well, I'm not really
in the clothing business.

634
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:56,087
I'm actually in the cloak-and-dagger
division of the Embassy, like my boy here.

635
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:57,671
Mostly cloak.

636
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:02,510
- Mostly dagger.
- Killed anyone today?

637
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:06,263
Well, let's see. About, what, one...
One an hour on average, I'd say.

638
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:11,519
And what type of people
did you kill today, James?

639
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:14,063
You know, the usual. Bad guys.

640
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,899
Bad guys? Baddest-ass, suicide-vested,

641
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:20,694
cold-hearted Pakistani motherfuckers
this side of Karachi.

642
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:27,159
No, well, seriously. I mean,
we took down a whole terrorist cell today.

643
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:28,786
Tell them.

644
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:31,414
That's what we were doing in the elevator
when you saw us.

645
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:32,665
Truth.

646
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:37,169
He's being modest.
Tell them how you saved the day.

647
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:40,131
- I helped.
- Did you at least catch them all?

648
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:46,512
Not sure, but find out soon enough.
All right, let's party. Let's party, yeah.

649
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:48,305
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

650
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,060
- Rise, Mr. Ghost.
- Oh, my God, it's real.

651
01:02:53,145 --> 01:02:55,646
Rise, Mr. Ghost.

652
01:02:56,148 --> 01:02:58,274
What did you think that was?

653
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:01,527
I like you.

654
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,614
I like this girl.

655
01:03:06,658 --> 01:03:07,992
Excuse me.

656
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,203
Hello? Who?

657
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,707
No, I'm sorry, there's no Rose here.

658
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,252
Wrong number.

659
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:22,840
That's the call we've been waiting for.

660
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:27,428
What the fuck! What the fuck, Wax?

661
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:30,431
Shut the fuck up right now
and you listen to me.

662
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:31,891
Rose was a code word.

663
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:34,435
Nichole's number is on every Pakistani
cell phone that we found.

664
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:37,396
She is Pakistani, you stupid fuck.
It doesn't mean she's a terrorist.

665
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:38,564
It does when she's your best friend

666
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,274
and you got him living in an apartment
that's bugged.

667
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,943
- What...
- What the hell are you talking about, Wax?

668
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:44,820
I'll show you what I'm talking about.
You stay right there.

669
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:47,406
Don't you fucking move. Watch this.

670
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:00,169
Here. How much you want to bet,

671
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,088
she's got another dozen
buried around here?

672
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:06,717
What... You're the one
who rented the apartment.

673
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:10,304
Wait, wait. Wait.

674
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:13,307
Before we started dating,
I had her completely checked.

675
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:17,269
- She's totally clean, Wax.
- What? You had me checked out?

676
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:18,312
Obviously not enough.

677
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,981
She's working for the fucking people
who took your picture, man.

678
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:24,151
No, I don't believe you.
You got the wrong girl, Wax.

679
01:04:24,236 --> 01:04:25,819
- You got the wrong girl.
- What are you...

680
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:27,488
What are you wearing right now
that she gave you?

681
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,615
- Nothing.
- Your ring, man.

682
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,826
That's how they've been tracking us.
Come on, give it over, I'll prove it to you.

683
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:35,120
Come on, I'll give you my gun,
give me the fucking ring.

684
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:37,540
Give me the ring.
Give me the fucking ring, I'll prove it to you.

685
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:42,962
Don't. Don't. Please. Please. Please.

686
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:55,182
Don't you dare...
Don't you dare point that at me.

687
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:57,142
You point that at her.

688
01:04:58,937 --> 01:05:00,646
All right, this is how it works.

689
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:05,317
If there's a transmission in the ring,
it'll interfere with the stereo. See that?

690
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:15,619
Why, Caroline?

691
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:30,509
- Reese? You good?
- My shoulder.

692
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:33,095
I told you that fucking chick
will get you killed.

693
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:43,248
Fuck.

694
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:52,049
Volvo, green. 92-MPR-75.

695
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:02,059
Steve, come give me a hand in here.

696
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:16,407
There's one more.

697
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:20,828
There you go. Seventeen microphones,
five cameras. Two in your bedroom.

698
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:23,372
That's impossible.
Caroline couldn't even screw in a light bulb.

699
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:26,417
Whoever put this shit in
knew what they were doing.

700
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:30,087
Hope you got some good moves on you,
buddy-boy, if it gets on YouTube.

701
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:38,512
- I fucked up.
- Nah, you're just in love, man.

702
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:41,265
- Love's always a bitch.
- Yeah?

703
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:42,349
What do you know about love?

704
01:07:42,434 --> 01:07:46,311
Well, once in the Congo, twice in Beirut.
Same girl.

705
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:49,481
I ain't made of stone,
no matter what you think.

706
01:07:50,859 --> 01:07:54,111
Come on, think about it.
Where could she be? Family? Friends?

707
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:57,364
She never talked about her life
and I never thought to ask.

708
01:07:57,449 --> 01:08:00,325
I don't know anything about this girl, Wax.

709
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:03,620
How'd I miss this?

710
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:07,624
I need word on that Volvo.
We need to find this girl.

711
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:17,926
- Got it?
- You're on.

712
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:20,220
- Hello?
- Please don't bother tracing,

713
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:21,930
I will be off in a minute.

714
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:25,726
I'm sorry it came to this.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

715
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:29,271
- You need to understand.
- Then help me,

716
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,106
'cause I don't know
what the hell is going on.

717
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:33,692
Just tell me the truth, Caroline.

718
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,452
Six years ago,

719
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:47,247
I met a man
who opened my eyes to his faith.

720
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:50,918
And, finally, for the first time in my life,

721
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:54,004
everything made sense.
I knew I had a purpose.

722
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:57,549
To lie to me? To shoot me?

723
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:00,552
Serve my cause.

724
01:09:02,222 --> 01:09:06,225
And living with me, spying on me,
that was all part of your plan?

725
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:12,022
Caroline?

726
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:16,443
She's gone. Did you get a lock on it?

727
01:09:16,528 --> 01:09:18,153
- No, it's too short.
- It's okay. Okay, play it back.

728
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:19,947
Drop her voice down,
bring up the background.

729
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:21,365
You need to understand.

730
01:09:58,069 --> 01:09:59,236
Six years ago,

731
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:02,990
I met a man
who opened my eyes to his faith.

732
01:10:03,074 --> 01:10:05,409
Good, good. Louder, louder.

733
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:08,912
And, finally, for the first time in my life,

734
01:10:08,997 --> 01:10:10,831
- everything made...
- Where is that?

735
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:13,208
Could be... Could be the PÃ©riphÃ©rique.

736
01:10:13,293 --> 01:10:16,044
They're leaving Paris.
Where are they going?

737
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:17,921
Ambassador Bennington.

738
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:21,466
- Yes, sir?
- God damn it, what are you doing?

739
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,760
The delegation just landed, Reese.

740
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:25,888
Why the hell aren't you at the airport
to greet them?

741
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,146
Welcome to Paris.

742
01:10:41,613 --> 01:10:44,990
The American delegation just landed
for the US-African Aid Summit.

743
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,366
They're gonna hit the delegation.
Who's driving?

744
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:48,327
- That'll be me, sir.
- Come on, let's go.

745
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:50,495
Wait. Wait a sec. Is that it?

746
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,623
Don't you wanna think about this
for a second, Wax?

747
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:55,125
You think about it, you're the chess player.

748
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,026
I love this song.

749
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:32,204
Don't you say anything about this.
It's between us.

750
01:12:14,706 --> 01:12:16,081
Check this.

751
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:20,711
Are you okay, sir?

752
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:23,380
I don't know.

753
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:27,259
Something's wrong here.
Doesn't make sense.

754
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:32,222
If they wanted to hit the delegation,
then why did they wire this apartment?

755
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:34,641
Why'd they use me?

756
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:44,151
All the Paris bound lanes
have been blocked off.

757
01:12:44,235 --> 01:12:45,736
We'll reach the motorcade in a few minutes.

758
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,572
If those fuckers wanna strike
on the freeway, they shouldn't be far.

759
01:12:54,746 --> 01:12:56,955
There it is. Go, go. Floor it.

760
01:13:55,306 --> 01:13:57,641
This isn't gonna slow him down.
You got any heavy metal?

761
01:13:57,725 --> 01:13:59,267
How about this?

762
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:04,147
Come to daddy.

763
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,409
Closer.

764
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:06,960
I'm a little busy, Reese.
I'm about to smoke your girlfriend's car.

765
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:08,837
She is not inside that car.

766
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:12,465
What? What are you talking about?
I can see her in the passenger seat.

767
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:14,134
No, no, no, Wax. Listen to me.

768
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:18,680
She is not inside that car.
She's entering the Summit as a delegate.

769
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:23,018
What? Are you sure?
'Cause I can see her from here.

770
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:28,982
Wax, Wax,
the Volvo is probably a diversion.

771
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:32,194
Make sure you get a visual contact
before you take your shot.

772
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:34,738
Move closer, I got to look inside.

773
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:45,165
Fuck, you're right. She's not there.

774
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:48,251
- Shit! I'm on my way to the Summit.
- Okay, I'll be behind you.

775
01:15:48,336 --> 01:15:49,836
I got to clean this shit up.

776
01:16:17,615 --> 01:16:20,116
Have them turn the motorcade around.

777
01:16:24,455 --> 01:16:25,538
Yes?

778
01:16:26,457 --> 01:16:30,043
Excuse me, ma'am.
There's intel for a potential threat.

779
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:32,128
They want us to change our course.

780
01:16:33,464 --> 01:16:34,547
Negative.

781
01:16:36,968 --> 01:16:38,426
Did she do it?

782
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:48,228
Fuck.

783
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:58,446
Pass him up, get me on the bridge.

784
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:45,910
Come on, baby, one shot.

785
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:54,502
Get down, now! Get down!

786
01:18:30,748 --> 01:18:32,665
Welcome to Paris, baby.

787
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:50,100
- Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
- Good morning.

788
01:18:51,936 --> 01:18:53,019
Wax.

789
01:18:53,104 --> 01:18:55,271
Look, she's probably wearing
one of those shock-activated vests.

790
01:18:55,356 --> 01:18:57,148
Like the ones we found in that apartment?

791
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:58,691
No way. She wouldn't do that, Wax.

792
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:01,152
The bitch ain't going to the Summit
to make some speech, Reese.

793
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:02,821
If I can find her, I'll talk to her.

794
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:04,989
Yeah, she'll blow
your fucking head off, okay?

795
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:06,616
Now, you're going to have to aim up high,

796
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,368
where there's no vest.
You understand what I'm saying?

797
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:11,413
Do you fucking understand
what I'm saying?

798
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:13,790
- Okay, I got it.
- Good.

799
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:16,251
- Talking ain't gonna do the job, man. Okay?
- Excuse me.

800
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:19,003
You're going to have to take that shot.

801
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:20,171
Yeah.

802
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,555
I'm sorry, sir, I can't let you in.

803
01:19:28,639 --> 01:19:30,723
Could you please try it again, sir?

804
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:36,729
Sir, this card's already been used
by Ambassador Bennington's assistant.

805
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:38,064
That's impossible.

806
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:41,443
I am Ambassador Bennington's
personal aide.

807
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:42,569
Please come with me, sir.

808
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:44,154
- Look, I can explain.
- Sir, right this way.

809
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:45,613
I think my girlfriend stole my card

810
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:46,990
- to get into the Summit.
- Sir, please come with me.

811
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:48,158
- Lf you'll just give me...
- Come with me, sir.

812
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:49,617
- Lf you'll just give me a minute...
- Please, sir...

813
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:52,620
Ambassador Bennington.
Ambassador Bennington.

814
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:56,374
Let him through, for God's sake,
he's my personal aide.

815
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,751
- Give me that.
- Where the hell have you been?

816
01:19:58,836 --> 01:20:01,629
Reese, are you aware what happened
to the delegation on the freeway?

817
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:04,716
- I need to talk to you right now, sir.
- So what is going on?

818
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,009
Weapon.

819
01:20:11,182 --> 01:20:14,058
Reese, since when do you carry a gun?

820
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:17,228
There's a suicide bomber
inside the Embassy.

821
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:20,106
- There's been absolutely no intel on that.
- I'm telling you.

822
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:22,025
You need to clear this conference
right now.

823
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:24,277
I can't shut down the Summit
on a vague assumption...

824
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:26,404
This is not an assumption.

825
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:29,824
I know the bomber, sir. She's my fiancÃ©e.

826
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:34,704
- Your fiancÃ©e?
- She's been using me as a cover all along.

827
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,709
Are you sure she's in here?

828
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:44,422
No, I'm not.

829
01:20:46,634 --> 01:20:49,052
Mr. Ambassador,
the delegation is about to arrive.

830
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:51,554
- Let him go.
- Not with the weapon.

831
01:20:53,891 --> 01:20:55,391
Thank you, sir.

832
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:57,227
Excuse me.

833
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:01,689
Excuse me. Excuse me.

834
01:21:27,925 --> 01:21:29,217
Caroline!

835
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:33,846
Excuse me.

836
01:21:37,977 --> 01:21:39,102
Shit.

837
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:45,733
Caroline?

838
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:53,658
There's a situation here.

839
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:59,956
Don't you fucking move!
Don't you fucking move!

840
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,584
Get down, sir. Get down!

841
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:08,256
- Drop the weapon, sir.
- Caroline.

842
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:12,051
- I need you to drop the weapon, sir.
- Caroline. Don't move.

843
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:15,763
I do not wanna do this.
I do not wanna shoot you.

844
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:19,809
I need you
to lay your weapon down now, sir.

845
01:22:23,147 --> 01:22:25,189
Lay your weapon down, sir.

846
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:31,070
Put your weapon down, sir.

847
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:36,993
Drop the weapon.

848
01:22:40,331 --> 01:22:41,748
- Oh, shit.
- No, no, no.

849
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:44,459
Do not shoot, that vest will explode.

850
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:55,887
Caroline, please, let me help you.

851
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:02,477
I don't need any help.

852
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:06,898
I am at peace.

853
01:23:11,695 --> 01:23:13,780
Caroline, this isn't peace.

854
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:18,284
You told me before

855
01:23:18,369 --> 01:23:22,789
that the reason you did all this
is to find some kind of purpose,

856
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:24,999
try to make sense of it all.

857
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:29,337
Well, that's all I want, too, Caroline.

858
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:34,509
No, no, please. Don't do this.

859
01:23:35,386 --> 01:23:37,970
Just listen to me, okay?

860
01:23:38,055 --> 01:23:40,640
Just for a minute. Just listen to me.

861
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:49,482
Nothing else in the world matters
right now, Caroline.

862
01:23:50,401 --> 01:23:52,068
Except I love you.

863
01:23:55,072 --> 01:23:57,156
And that's all I have.

864
01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:00,368
Love for you.

865
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:10,545
And even if you don't love me,

866
01:24:12,256 --> 01:24:15,425
that's all the sense any of us
is ever gonna get.

867
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:21,681
Love.

868
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:45,431
What the hell is going on?

869
01:25:45,516 --> 01:25:48,601
I did not fly 10 freaking hours
to get my ass melting in this limo.

870
01:25:48,685 --> 01:25:50,686
I'm sure it's all for your own safety, ma'am.

871
01:25:50,771 --> 01:25:54,732
You always say that when you don't have
a clue about what's going on.

872
01:25:54,817 --> 01:25:59,070
Wax. Wax. For Christ's sake,
would you please explain what's going on?

873
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:02,615
Excuse me, ma'am, I'm very sorry.

874
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:05,993
There's been a security problem,
it has been handled and you're free to go.

875
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:07,495
Have a nice evening.

876
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:15,878
I want to know who's responsible
for this delay, and I want him fired.

877
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:20,466
That's what I like about the job,

878
01:26:20,551 --> 01:26:23,553
you get acknowledged,
you get compliments.

879
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:32,311
Here, I got you a little something
to keep you going,

880
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:34,939
- wherever it is you are going.
- Yeah?

881
01:26:36,817 --> 01:26:38,526
How'd you get that, man?

882
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:40,111
You know, I've got this sense

883
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:43,239
that you're gonna take your act on the road
pretty soon here,

884
01:26:43,323 --> 01:26:46,033
courtesy of the
very appreciative government.

885
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:51,372
But I must tell you that
I wouldn't be against your coming with me.

886
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:55,167
I got to get back to the apartment, Wax.
I got so many things I need to take care of.

887
01:26:55,252 --> 01:26:57,879
That apartment's been packed up
and shipped out.

888
01:26:57,963 --> 01:27:00,590
But I think I know what you're looking for.

889
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:11,726
Little something to remember her by.

890
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:13,895
Thanks, Wax.

891
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:16,814
Come on, let's play a little chess game
before I go.

892
01:27:16,899 --> 01:27:19,984
I thought you were the kind of guy
who didn't like to play chess.

893
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:21,736
I lied. Sue me.

894
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:24,280
Okay, but I got to warn you,
I don't take prisoners.

895
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:28,284
Well, I got to warn you,
I'm a very sore loser.

896
01:27:29,036 --> 01:27:32,121
- Okay, well, if that's the case...
- No shit.

897
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:37,418
Yeah, man. Damn.
Welcome to the club, pard.

898
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:39,378
You're going down.
You are so going down.

899
01:27:39,463 --> 01:27:42,006
Listen, hoss, let me tell you something.

900
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:45,968
What I forgot about this game,
you haven't even learned yet.

901
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:47,053
- Really?
- Yeah.

902
01:27:47,137 --> 01:27:49,138
- Not just talk man. Okay.
- Just watch.

903
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:52,058
So tell me about that girl in Beirut.
