1
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,837
All clear.

2
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:19,048
Shh.

3
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:20,620
Ali.

4
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,307
<i>Do we belong there?
Do we not?</i>

5
00:03:42,737 --> 00:03:44,830
<i>It doesn't matter
how you would answer that...</i>

6
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:49,340
<i>...because we are there.
We're tired, and we can't see the end.</i>

7
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:54,177
<i>We can't even console ourselves
that our enemy is just as tired as we are.</i>

8
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:56,473
<i>Because they're not.</i>

9
00:03:59,487 --> 00:04:05,392
<i>It is a fallacy that prolonged war
will weaken an occupied enemy.</i>

10
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,584
He's dead.

11
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:10,094
<i>It most likely
will make your enemy stronger.</i>

12
00:04:10,265 --> 00:04:13,826
<i>They get used to the deprivation,
and they adapt and respond accordingly.</i>

13
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:17,232
While here at home...

14
00:04:17,405 --> 00:04:21,808
<i>The explosion occurred in one of
Manchester's heavily Asian neighborhoods.</i>

15
00:04:21,977 --> 00:04:23,569
...with every death reported...

16
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:28,045
...we have to deal with a public-opinion
trajectory that slides rapidly...

17
00:04:28,216 --> 00:04:32,050
...from supportive to negative
to downright hostile.

18
00:04:32,687 --> 00:04:36,748
People just get sick and tired
of a moment's silence at a ball game.

19
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:39,584
They just wanna be told that it's over.

20
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:42,229
<i>Police and emergency
workers in Manchester...</i>

21
00:04:42,397 --> 00:04:45,264
<i>...are still combing through what is left
of this block of flats.</i>

22
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:47,025
<i>They say this was not the target.</i>

23
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:50,831
<i>Had the bombs being constructed here
found their eventual intended target...</i>

24
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:52,200
<i>...the devastation could...</i>

25
00:04:52,374 --> 00:04:54,035
Despite the fact...

26
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:57,235
...we have markedly increased
our operational intensity...

27
00:04:58,013 --> 00:04:59,913
...we're not seeing any progress.

28
00:05:00,982 --> 00:05:02,916
What we're dealing with here...

29
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:06,315
...is potentially a global conflagration...

30
00:05:06,488 --> 00:05:10,288
...that requires constant diligence
in order to suppress.

31
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,751
Now, you see...

32
00:05:14,296 --> 00:05:17,322
...because our enemy...

33
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:22,493
...has realized that they are fighting guys
from the future.

34
00:05:23,371 --> 00:05:28,035
Now, ahem, it is brilliant
as it is infuriating.

35
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:32,669
If you live like it's the past,
and you behave like it's the past...

36
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:36,180
...then guys from the future
find it very hard to see you.

37
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:39,878
If you throw away your cell phone,
shut down your e-mail...

38
00:05:40,055 --> 00:05:44,116
<i>...pass all your instructions face-to-face,
hand-to-hand...</i>

39
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:47,557
<i>...turn your back on technology
and just disappear into the crowd...</i>

40
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:50,562
<i>No flags. No uniforms.</i>

41
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,861
<i>You got your basic grunts
on the ground there.</i>

42
00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:56,367
<i>They're looking going,
"Who is it we're fighting?"</i>

43
00:05:56,538 --> 00:06:01,168
<i>In a situation like this,
your friends dress just like your enemies...</i>

44
00:06:01,343 --> 00:06:03,834
<i>...and your enemies dress
like your friends.</i>

45
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:09,213
What I need you to fully understand is that
these people, they do not wanna negotiate.

46
00:06:09,384 --> 00:06:10,874
Not at all.

47
00:06:11,052 --> 00:06:15,284
<i>They want the universal caliphate
established across the face of the Earth...</i>

48
00:06:16,624 --> 00:06:21,027
<i>...and they want every infidel converted
or dead.</i>

49
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:26,060
So, what's changed...

50
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:29,837
...is that our
allegedly unsophisticated enemy...

51
00:06:30,004 --> 00:06:33,337
...has cottoned on
to the factually unsophisticated truth...

52
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:34,839
...we're an easy target.

53
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:37,739
<i>We are an easy target...</i>

54
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:41,439
<i>...and our world as we know it
is a lot simpler...</i>

55
00:06:41,616 --> 00:06:44,710
...to put to an end than you might think.

56
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:48,954
We take our foot off the throat
of this enemy for one minute...

57
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:51,388
...and our world changes completely.

58
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:53,424
Thank you, Mr. Hoffman.

59
00:07:05,673 --> 00:07:06,935
BASSAM

60
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:09,203
I'm coming.

61
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:17,444
You're early.

62
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:19,920
Big boss man, what's happening?

63
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,385
What's the story?

64
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:25,856
Rules of the day.

65
00:07:26,027 --> 00:07:28,291
If the car gets immobilized,
start shooting.

66
00:07:28,463 --> 00:07:30,624
Nobody gets traded. Everybody dies.

67
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:32,562
So same as every day?

68
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:35,567
- You got it. Want some breakfast?
- Hell, yes.

69
00:07:36,571 --> 00:07:37,595
Thanks.

70
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:40,338
All right. Tell me something real.

71
00:07:40,975 --> 00:07:43,205
<i>Oh, all I got is real, man. You know me.</i>

72
00:07:43,378 --> 00:07:44,606
All right, let's hear it.

73
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:48,374
All right, a guy named Nizar.

74
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,745
He's from Aquiz up near Tikrit, right?

75
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:54,377
So he gets all fucked in his head
after the invasion, you know?

76
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:57,184
He starts working with the Baathists,
then the jihadists.

77
00:07:57,358 --> 00:08:00,486
But he is scared shitless now, man.

78
00:08:00,662 --> 00:08:03,062
He's supposed
to do a martyrdom operation...

79
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:05,290
...but he doesn't wanna fucking die.

80
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:07,594
So he's coming to us.

81
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:09,134
- He's coming to us?
- Mm-hm.

82
00:08:10,638 --> 00:08:12,265
For chrissakes, move the donkey.

83
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:17,142
Move it, let's go.
Get these guys moving. Let's go.

84
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:19,644
Come on, come on.

85
00:08:19,814 --> 00:08:22,544
Oh, my God. Just get the...
Buy the fucking flowers.

86
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:26,919
Come on, come on.

87
00:08:27,088 --> 00:08:29,852
So, what are the chances
your man's playing both sides?

88
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:32,151
I don't know. What are they with me?

89
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:34,295
Three to one.

90
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:35,827
All right. Let's slow down.

91
00:08:35,997 --> 00:08:37,464
Is this it?

92
00:08:37,632 --> 00:08:40,760
Yeah. This is it.

93
00:08:40,935 --> 00:08:43,995
Nitrate 37 slewing to target ports now.

94
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:45,696
01 L2MDT.

95
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:48,001
On target, 15:31 Zulu.

96
00:08:48,176 --> 00:08:50,110
Cell phone linked to moving vehicle.

97
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:51,939
<i>Stop right up here.</i>

98
00:08:52,113 --> 00:08:55,412
Right up here. Let me take a look.

99
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,248
- I don't see anything.
- I'm gonna call him.

100
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:03,287
All right, call him.

101
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:08,920
<i>Bassam.</i>

102
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:10,724
Yeah, Nizar.

103
00:09:14,235 --> 00:09:15,259
NIZAR:

104
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:16,596
Huh?

105
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:18,466
NIZAR:

106
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,800
IR 3.9.

107
00:09:19,974 --> 00:09:23,501
- He says he wants one of us to come in.
- He is to meet inside the car.

108
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:26,169
Inside the car.
If he wants to talk, it's in the car.

109
00:09:26,347 --> 00:09:29,043
You have to come to us, Nizar.

110
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:31,811
- I'm coming to you.
- Do the fuck what I said. Go.

111
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:34,752
Hey, hey. Listen to me.

112
00:09:34,923 --> 00:09:37,187
I am not getting my head cut off
on the Internet.

113
00:09:37,358 --> 00:09:38,825
If something happens, shoot me.

114
00:09:38,993 --> 00:09:42,156
- Will you shoot me?
- Fuck that shit. I will shoot you right now.

115
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,525
- I'm not kidding.
- Quit being a pussy.

116
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:49,897
Nizar.

117
00:09:52,206 --> 00:09:53,798
Zooming in.

118
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:55,533
Visual confirmed.

119
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:58,144
Long wave 10.7.

120
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:08,682
Shit.

121
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:11,825
- I can't talk right now, Larry.
- She wants the house.

122
00:10:11,993 --> 00:10:14,587
<i>Give her the house.
It's a piece of shit, all right?</i>

123
00:10:14,762 --> 00:10:16,923
- We're getting this, sir.
- We're getting it.

124
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:19,896
She can ask for whatever she wants,
but I'm not listening.

125
00:10:20,068 --> 00:10:22,559
<i>What the hell are you calling for?
Hang up the phone.</i>

126
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:24,204
Hang up the phone.

127
00:10:26,274 --> 00:10:27,764
Are you on the line?

128
00:10:27,942 --> 00:10:30,638
I can see you now, all right?
You are attracting attention.

129
00:10:30,812 --> 00:10:34,179
Get the fuck out of here right now.
I will handle this on my own.

130
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:35,577
Roger that. Off target.

131
00:10:36,417 --> 00:10:38,977
Copy. Off target, 3-10.

132
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:45,019
FERRIS

133
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:46,819
Yes.

134
00:10:46,995 --> 00:10:48,394
Good, good, good.

135
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:54,765
You want an orange? You hungry?

136
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:56,062
No.

137
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:02,075
So, Nizar...

138
00:11:02,243 --> 00:11:04,040
...why'd you come to me, huh?

139
00:11:04,612 --> 00:11:06,580
I know too many things.

140
00:11:08,082 --> 00:11:10,676
They prepared me to go outside Iraq.

141
00:11:11,986 --> 00:11:14,716
What do you mean by "outside Iraq"?

142
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:18,256
They said they need me
to become shahid...

143
00:11:18,426 --> 00:11:20,451
...for martyrdom.

144
00:11:20,628 --> 00:11:24,086
When a man knows too much,
they say martyrdom.

145
00:11:24,265 --> 00:11:28,065
Who do you mean by "they," Nizar? Hm?

146
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:36,036
I don't want to die.

147
00:11:38,212 --> 00:11:40,442
I want to go to America.

148
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:43,444
I have a Ph. D., you know?

149
00:11:43,618 --> 00:11:46,485
And they want me...
They want me to blow myself up.

150
00:11:46,988 --> 00:11:49,786
- Ph. D. in what, chemistry?
- No.

151
00:11:49,957 --> 00:11:52,118
What do you know
about radiological materials?

152
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:55,387
Linguistic. I speak five languages.
Five, you know?

153
00:11:55,563 --> 00:11:57,690
Nobody should say "martyr" to me.
Nobody.

154
00:11:57,865 --> 00:12:00,459
- You are a rare and a delicate flower.
- Yes, I am.

155
00:12:00,635 --> 00:12:01,659
- Yes.
- Yes.

156
00:12:01,836 --> 00:12:04,669
So you don't wanna kill the Jews
and the Crusaders, huh?

157
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,037
What do you know about our pain?

158
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,668
Cut the bullshit, all right?

159
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:12,938
Give me some information.
What do you know?

160
00:12:18,553 --> 00:12:21,681
You know,
I know enough to be martyred.

161
00:12:21,856 --> 00:12:25,155
But with you,
I know enough to stay alive.

162
00:12:30,998 --> 00:12:33,023
You have a computer?

163
00:12:50,718 --> 00:12:52,743
<i>- Yup.
- Hey, Ed, it's me.</i>

164
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,718
I got an Iraqi walk-in, up near Samarra.

165
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,587
He's got a communiqué video here that
somebody walked across the Iranian border.

166
00:12:59,761 --> 00:13:01,592
I'm watching it right now, sir.

167
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,323
<i>- Can you see his face?
- Yes, captain.</i>

168
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:06,433
<i>I am looking at the white whale.</i>

169
00:13:06,901 --> 00:13:09,233
<i>- It is Al-Saleem.
- What's he saying?</i>

170
00:13:09,403 --> 00:13:10,665
<i>Well, it's gotta be current.</i>

171
00:13:10,838 --> 00:13:13,102
He mentions the Sheffield bus bombings
a week ago.

172
00:13:13,274 --> 00:13:16,971
He's telling the brothers to prepare for
a UK operation's already planned...

173
00:13:17,145 --> 00:13:20,672
...which is the bombing these people
fucked up in Manchester this morning.

174
00:13:21,115 --> 00:13:23,743
<i>Let me translate this part
for you directly.</i>

175
00:13:26,788 --> 00:13:30,815
"We will avenge the America wars
on the Muslim world.

176
00:13:32,627 --> 00:13:34,959
We will come at them everywhere.

177
00:13:35,596 --> 00:13:40,533
<i>We will strike at random, across Europe,
then America, continually.</i>

178
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:42,566
We have bled.

179
00:13:42,737 --> 00:13:46,537
Now they will bleed. And bleed.

180
00:13:47,141 --> 00:13:49,041
Until they are bled out. "

181
00:13:51,312 --> 00:13:52,779
Ed.

182
00:13:52,947 --> 00:13:55,541
It's 6:00 in the morning.

183
00:13:55,716 --> 00:13:57,445
Saving civilization, honey.

184
00:13:57,618 --> 00:13:59,415
<i>Disks are passed from hand to hand.</i>

185
00:13:59,587 --> 00:14:02,147
The communiqués are not transmitted,
not copied.

186
00:14:02,323 --> 00:14:05,781
My man says that real orders
are verbal or in code on paper.

187
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,087
Is there any indication of where he is?

188
00:14:08,262 --> 00:14:11,720
No, sir.
He definitely does not have his location.

189
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,260
But he did mention there's a safe house
up north, near Balad...

190
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:17,028
<i>...where Al-Saleem may have been.</i>

191
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:18,832
Dad?

192
00:14:19,006 --> 00:14:20,337
Hey.

193
00:14:20,508 --> 00:14:23,477
They're killing anyone who knows anything.
He's scared.

194
00:14:23,644 --> 00:14:26,112
<i>We need to debrief him very carefully.</i>

195
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,748
<i>- All right, so do it.
- In the States.</i>

196
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,247
No. Ahem.

197
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:32,943
They're onto him.
That's the reason he's running.

198
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,452
<i>- On the toilet, not the floor.
- You hear me, right?</i>

199
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:38,114
So he wants to come to America
in one piece...

200
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:40,487
...instead of going to paradise
in a thousand.

201
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:42,458
He should've thought of that before.

202
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:46,157
I'm telling you.
They will kill him within a few days, Ed.

203
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:48,894
Yep. And if they do, that's all right...

204
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,630
...because we can be there
to see who pulls the trigger.

205
00:14:51,806 --> 00:14:54,104
Now, get back to bed. Good night.

206
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:57,938
- Am I missing the point?
- I just offered him asylum.

207
00:14:58,112 --> 00:14:59,773
<i>Well, you lied, buddy.</i>

208
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:03,812
So just cut him loose...

209
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:06,283
<i>...and put him back on the street.</i>

210
00:15:06,988 --> 00:15:08,012
All right.

211
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:19,197
Okay, so everything's fine.
No, no, no problem. No problem.

212
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:23,463
We just have to ask you a few more
questions, and then we can go.

213
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:25,902
No, no more questions.
Take me to the Green Zone.

214
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:29,406
Maybe we could help. We have
a few questions. Everything will be fine.

215
00:15:29,577 --> 00:15:32,603
Trust me. Okay? It's okay. Sit down.

216
00:15:34,548 --> 00:15:37,039
You're a liar. You're a liar. You fucking d...

217
00:15:37,218 --> 00:15:39,880
Get on the fucking... Back the fuck up!
Step back!

218
00:15:40,054 --> 00:15:42,989
I talk to you! I talk to you!
And that's all you want!

219
00:15:43,157 --> 00:15:46,649
- You want to see who kills me, huh?
- Bassam. Search him. Get his phone.

220
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:50,825
Now you've seen our faces.
You know what that means.

221
00:15:50,998 --> 00:15:52,022
Computer.

222
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,633
Guantanamo?
You threaten me with Guantanamo?

223
00:15:54,802 --> 00:15:56,770
If you don't do exactly what I say...

224
00:15:56,938 --> 00:15:59,338
...I will execute you right here.
Do you understand?

225
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:04,310
Listen, we are your friends, okay?
We're your friends.

226
00:16:04,478 --> 00:16:07,003
We're here to watch you.
We're here to protect you.

227
00:16:07,548 --> 00:16:09,345
You can't even protect yourselves.

228
00:16:20,127 --> 00:16:22,254
<i>Boss?
- Yeah, I'm right here.</i>

229
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,091
<i>I got a visual on him.</i>

230
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:26,324
<i>Okay, where's he coming from?</i>

231
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,559
He's riding up right now.
Coming right to us.

232
00:16:28,736 --> 00:16:30,761
<i>Yes. I see him. I see him.</i>

233
00:16:30,938 --> 00:16:33,964
He's coming down the street.
He's coming north towards the square.

234
00:16:34,141 --> 00:16:37,440
<i>- I'm gonna hang back.
- All right, I'll let you know what he's doing.</i>

235
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:40,546
Keep an eye on him for me.
- He stopped in front of the café.

236
00:16:40,715 --> 00:16:42,410
He's walking right up.

237
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:46,310
<i>- Listen, Bassam?
- Yeah?</i>

238
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:52,517
There is a black van heading this way
with some pretty dangerous-looking guys.

239
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:56,254
<i>- They're staring right at him.
- Yeah, I see it.</i>

240
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,796
<i>Tell me what it does.
- All right.</i>

241
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:02,868
Looks like it's parking right up ahead.
Yeah, it stopped. The van stopped.

242
00:17:03,037 --> 00:17:04,231
<i>Can I turn around?</i>

243
00:17:04,405 --> 00:17:06,600
Yeah, yeah, Nizar's getting on his bike.

244
00:17:06,774 --> 00:17:09,436
<i>There's like four or five guys
getting out of that van.</i>

245
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,068
<i>Can you identify any of these guys?
- I've never seen these guys before.</i>

246
00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:14,271
We gotta move.

247
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:34,958
Did you see a flash?
- What?

248
00:17:35,436 --> 00:17:36,767
Did somebody get hit?

249
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:39,599
Let's see a playback on that.
- Stay with him.

250
00:17:41,475 --> 00:17:44,706
Hello.
- In case you didn't see it, I executed him.

251
00:17:44,879 --> 00:17:46,141
<i>You did what you had to do.</i>

252
00:17:46,313 --> 00:17:50,477
If you hadn't, he would be describing you
down to your eyebrows to them right now.

253
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:52,949
I did it, all right? It's done. I killed him.

254
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,554
<i>He was always gonna get killed
no matter what he did.</i>

255
00:17:55,723 --> 00:17:58,157
Besides, you'd milked him and he was dry.

256
00:17:58,325 --> 00:18:00,088
Excuse me.

257
00:18:01,062 --> 00:18:02,427
<i>Ferris?</i>

258
00:18:02,596 --> 00:18:04,496
Is your silence supposed
to say something?

259
00:18:04,665 --> 00:18:06,929
Because you do know we're at war, right?

260
00:18:07,101 --> 00:18:11,060
Your friend, who you must have had some
intense cross-cultural eye contact with...

261
00:18:11,238 --> 00:18:14,207
...was a terrorist a-hole,
who turned out to be a coward...

262
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,036
...who wanted to go to Disneyland.

263
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,509
Listen, Ed, we're going north now,
do you hear me?

264
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,480
<i>- We're going north to the Balad safe house.
- No, no, no, buddy. No, you're not.</i>

265
00:18:23,651 --> 00:18:25,346
You're blown. There's chatter.

266
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,647
Well, if I'm blown, Ed, that means
you should've sent a team here...

267
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:32,884
...the minute Nizar got shot,
but you didn't send a team, did you?

268
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,255
Well, not since we've been talking, Ferris.

269
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:38,489
You and I, we're going to that safe house,
you understand? Now.

270
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,429
<i>- Ferris?
- Where's the goddamn car, huh?</i>

271
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:41,625
Let's get out of here.

272
00:19:12,032 --> 00:19:15,126
It's time to move.
I'm coming back to you, all right?

273
00:19:17,872 --> 00:19:20,067
If something happens,
you'll shoot me, right?

274
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:22,573
- Yep.
- Good.

275
00:20:08,022 --> 00:20:09,512
Got you.

276
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,248
Don't you fucking do it.

277
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,451
Hassan! Hassan!

278
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:29,131
Urgent request you dispatch Chili, Speck
or Nitrate to these coordinates.

279
00:20:37,785 --> 00:20:41,221
North, 34 degrees, 20 minutes,
16.8 seconds.

280
00:20:41,388 --> 00:20:44,721
<i>East, 44 degrees, 24 minutes,
14.4 seconds.</i>

281
00:20:44,892 --> 00:20:48,623
This is a live target, a known
operational base of an Al-Saleem cell.

282
00:20:48,796 --> 00:20:51,356
- A high-value target.
- Copy that, on approach.

283
00:21:14,521 --> 00:21:16,716
Aah! Get back!

284
00:21:27,201 --> 00:21:29,101
Come on!

285
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:32,205
- Gotta go! Gotta go!
- I'm getting the intel!

286
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:38,068
Get in the fucking car, man!
Come on! Come on!

287
00:21:43,684 --> 00:21:45,311
Go! Go!

288
00:21:54,662 --> 00:21:57,563
I've got guys coming down
the hill! Two trucks! On the right!

289
00:21:57,731 --> 00:21:59,323
I got it.

290
00:22:00,134 --> 00:22:01,192
Keep moving!

291
00:22:26,427 --> 00:22:27,451
Fuck.

292
00:22:27,628 --> 00:22:30,358
We're in some serious
fucking trouble here.

293
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:34,126
We're on Highway 1, south of Samarra.
We're being pursued by two vehicles.

294
00:22:34,301 --> 00:22:36,997
<i>We have valuable intel in our possession!</i>

295
00:22:37,171 --> 00:22:40,004
We're in a black Nissan.
Where the fuck are you people?

296
00:22:40,174 --> 00:22:42,665
<i>- I see them!
- We're right on their six.</i>

297
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:48,175
<i>- Have visual, will engage.
- Copy that. Engage at will.</i>

298
00:23:01,128 --> 00:23:03,153
RPG. Take them out now.

299
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:10,636
<i>Fire!</i>

300
00:23:10,804 --> 00:23:12,271
RPG!

301
00:23:15,943 --> 00:23:17,604
<i>Nine, one, two, six, one.</i>

302
00:23:24,785 --> 00:23:26,548
Let's go!

303
00:23:28,322 --> 00:23:31,052
- Fuel tank is ruptured!
- I got him! Get the driver out!

304
00:23:31,225 --> 00:23:34,319
I can't! He's in pieces!
- Then get the bag! Get the intel!

305
00:23:35,396 --> 00:23:36,829
Bassam! Bassam!

306
00:23:37,498 --> 00:23:40,467
Stay with them. We are tracking.

307
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:43,734
- Bassam!
Get his legs!

308
00:23:44,571 --> 00:23:47,631
No!
- Intel secure!

309
00:23:47,808 --> 00:23:49,571
Let's go! Stay down.

310
00:23:50,544 --> 00:23:51,806
Come on, buddy.

311
00:23:52,379 --> 00:23:54,347
Come on. Get him out, now!

312
00:24:09,563 --> 00:24:11,326
<i>He's dead.</i>

313
00:24:15,702 --> 00:24:17,101
Who are you?

314
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:18,397
What's your name?

315
00:24:18,572 --> 00:24:21,507
Do you know where you are? Come on!

316
00:24:22,342 --> 00:24:23,934
Fuck.

317
00:24:38,392 --> 00:24:39,882
What's that?

318
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,584
Bone fragments.

319
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:43,690
Not yours.

320
00:24:50,304 --> 00:24:53,762
- They get that stuff I sent out?
- All uploaded to Langley.

321
00:24:53,941 --> 00:24:55,670
Mr. Hoffman.

322
00:24:57,778 --> 00:25:00,178
<i>- Hey, Ed.
- Ferris.</i>

323
00:25:00,347 --> 00:25:04,340
<i>- Christmas came early, buddy.
- Oh, yeah? What'd I get for Christmas, Ed?</i>

324
00:25:04,518 --> 00:25:08,454
Well, 15 pages of this, 40 pages of that.

325
00:25:08,622 --> 00:25:13,116
I got, like, about 712 phone numbers
that are new to us...

326
00:25:13,293 --> 00:25:15,124
...that we can strip and evaluate...

327
00:25:15,295 --> 00:25:18,389
...and amongst other things,
a safe house in Amman.

328
00:25:18,565 --> 00:25:21,033
I've got jihadists coming and going
from this place...

329
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:23,169
...like it's happy hour at the Cat House.

330
00:25:23,804 --> 00:25:24,964
You gotta see this place.

331
00:25:25,606 --> 00:25:29,804
Before we get into that, I wanna know
what you're doing for Bassam's family, Ed.

332
00:25:29,977 --> 00:25:31,467
I didn't know the man.

333
00:25:31,645 --> 00:25:34,205
What are you doing for Bassam's family?
He was your guy.

334
00:25:34,381 --> 00:25:35,905
<i>So now you don't know him, huh?</i>

335
00:25:37,284 --> 00:25:40,913
<i>You'll be going to Amman
as acting station chief.</i>

336
00:25:41,088 --> 00:25:44,353
You'll outrank Holiday. No matter
what he says, you're the show-runner.

337
00:25:44,525 --> 00:25:48,757
<i>You'll liaise with Jordanian GID,
who are as hot for Al-Saleem as we are.</i>

338
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:51,193
You'll be working with
a guy named Hani Salaam...

339
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:53,890
...who is not your run-of-the-mill
fingernail-puller.

340
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:55,466
Hani is a professional.

341
00:25:55,636 --> 00:25:57,627
And will I be sharing information
with him?

342
00:25:57,804 --> 00:26:00,671
<i>Let me say this about that: No.</i>

343
00:26:01,441 --> 00:26:04,569
Now, you wanna take a few weeks off
and go bang the wife?

344
00:26:04,745 --> 00:26:08,442
I'm getting a divorce, Ed. You know that.
You know more about it than I do.

345
00:26:08,615 --> 00:26:11,675
<i>Everybody around here screws up
their marriage, buddy. Why not you?</i>

346
00:26:12,753 --> 00:26:13,947
So you'll go to Amman?

347
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:20,385
I will go to Amman. I'll call you later.

348
00:27:00,067 --> 00:27:04,003
This car is a real pile of shit.
Is this the best they could afford?

349
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:07,732
I brought this car in case you wanted
to cruise the safe house now, you know?

350
00:27:07,908 --> 00:27:11,309
No one cruises that safe house, all right?

351
00:27:11,478 --> 00:27:14,641
I need to take a shit, I need a shower
and an Internet connection...

352
00:27:14,815 --> 00:27:17,511
...so just take me to my apartment,
all right?

353
00:27:18,452 --> 00:27:20,886
Got you in a high-rise.

354
00:27:21,054 --> 00:27:23,852
Hot and cold water. And you can drink it.

355
00:27:24,024 --> 00:27:25,753
- Great.
- There's not much local color.

356
00:27:26,326 --> 00:27:28,692
I've had it with the local color.
Thank you.

357
00:27:44,811 --> 00:27:46,972
Cheap-ass motherfuckers.

358
00:27:52,386 --> 00:27:54,217
Morning, sir.

359
00:27:54,888 --> 00:27:55,980
He's clear.

360
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,992
NSA is listening to the phones
and computer links...

361
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:02,992
...of anyone who's been near the house.

362
00:28:03,163 --> 00:28:06,929
Look, they don't have to be geniuses
to stop using their e-mail and cell phones.

363
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,364
I don't understand why
you haven't figured out...

364
00:28:09,536 --> 00:28:12,369
...that they're not communicating
electronically anymore.

365
00:28:13,573 --> 00:28:15,973
The house is owned
by a family named Alousi.

366
00:28:16,143 --> 00:28:19,476
And in my opinion, it just seems
like a normal Jordanian family...

367
00:28:19,646 --> 00:28:21,341
...with a lot of country relatives.

368
00:28:21,515 --> 00:28:22,880
Normal Jordanian family.

369
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:29,046
But all of them are unmarried males
between the ages of 18 and 35, correct?

370
00:28:29,222 --> 00:28:31,622
Listen, kid,
whatever information you got in Iraq...

371
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:34,852
...I just don't think this house
is what you think it is.

372
00:28:35,028 --> 00:28:38,987
These boys drink alcohol, they chase girls,
they smoke hash, and...

373
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,633
So did Mohamed Atta, right?

374
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:43,167
- It's Takfir methodology.
- Takfir methodology.

375
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,137
Correct. It's permitted in order
to deceive the infidel.

376
00:28:47,607 --> 00:28:50,838
You've had guys watching them
go in and out of this safe house here...

377
00:28:51,011 --> 00:28:52,205
...but what I don't get...

378
00:28:52,379 --> 00:28:55,177
...is why you haven't had anyone
monitoring them after.

379
00:28:55,348 --> 00:28:57,873
Well, there's so much activity
at this location...

380
00:28:58,051 --> 00:29:01,509
...that we have exhausted the station's
indigenous-appearing manpower.

381
00:29:01,688 --> 00:29:04,919
So you don't have enough good Arab guys
to follow the bad Arab guys...

382
00:29:05,092 --> 00:29:06,957
...is what you're saying.
- That's right.

383
00:29:07,127 --> 00:29:09,823
Well, you're gonna need
some more human surveillance...

384
00:29:09,996 --> 00:29:12,157
...loaners from Jordanian Intelligence.

385
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:13,826
All right. Skip, get out.

386
00:29:21,475 --> 00:29:24,137
Now, I am in receipt of a directive...

387
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:28,907
...which tells me that I am
to make myself useful to you...

388
00:29:29,082 --> 00:29:33,018
...in whichever way
that you request or require.

389
00:29:33,186 --> 00:29:37,145
But it is my feeling that to involve
the Jordanian secret service...

390
00:29:37,324 --> 00:29:39,588
...is a breach of operational integrity.

391
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,025
You don't need to tell me
about Jordanian Intelligence, all right?

392
00:29:43,196 --> 00:29:46,256
They are doing a far superior job
than you are, my friend.

393
00:29:46,433 --> 00:29:48,060
You've read that directive there...

394
00:29:48,235 --> 00:29:51,102
...which clearly states that I am in charge
of this operation.

395
00:29:51,271 --> 00:29:54,263
So, what I need you to do
is leave this office immediately...

396
00:29:54,441 --> 00:29:56,375
...and hand your entire staff over to me.

397
00:29:59,246 --> 00:30:03,444
You know, we've all watched your rise
in the Near East Division.

398
00:30:04,384 --> 00:30:05,874
I'll see you on the way down.

399
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,851
You and Hoffman both.

400
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,997
I need you to help me out
and get me a fresh pot of coffee, please...

401
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:26,230
...and a full staff meeting
within the next 15 minutes, all right?

402
00:30:26,406 --> 00:30:28,374
To be fair to Mr. Holiday, Mr. Ferris...

403
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:31,238
...Mr. Hoffman never told us
this would be such a big deal.

404
00:30:31,411 --> 00:30:33,743
Ed Hoffman is the head
of the Near East Division.

405
00:30:33,914 --> 00:30:38,146
But he does not know shit until he steals it
from the guy on the ground, and that's me.

406
00:30:38,318 --> 00:30:40,843
Now, please stop acting
like such a fucking ingénue...

407
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:44,718
...and try to get me a meeting
with Hani Salaam. Thanks.

408
00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:02,907
Mr. Ferris.

409
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,321
Hani Pasha.

410
00:31:18,491 --> 00:31:20,925
Pasha? That is an Ottoman term.

411
00:31:21,094 --> 00:31:24,325
Well, I hear you like it, sir.
Pleasure to meet you.

412
00:31:24,865 --> 00:31:28,164
- Mr. Ferris, please take a seat.
- Thank you, sir.

413
00:31:30,937 --> 00:31:34,373
- Welcome to our promising country.
- Thank you so much.

414
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:39,103
As reliable as your Ed Hoffman would call
a "towelhead monarchy" can be.

415
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,180
Well, we'll leave that to Ed Hoffman, sir.

416
00:31:42,883 --> 00:31:44,350
Mm.

417
00:31:47,187 --> 00:31:49,280
What have you heard about this building?

418
00:31:49,456 --> 00:31:53,950
Well, to be quite honest,
I hear they call it the fingernail factory.

419
00:31:54,828 --> 00:31:57,228
But no one close to you would say that,
of course.

420
00:31:57,397 --> 00:31:58,864
No.

421
00:31:59,366 --> 00:32:01,834
But people are stupid.

422
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:06,330
Torture doesn't work.

423
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,240
Under torture, a man will say
almost anything to make the pain stop.

424
00:32:12,913 --> 00:32:15,040
You have experience with this, I am sure.

425
00:32:18,118 --> 00:32:19,642
Mr. Ferris, here in Jordan...

426
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:23,255
...to the fundamentalists, you see,
I am, myself, the enemy.

427
00:32:24,024 --> 00:32:26,049
Perhaps the worst kind.

428
00:32:27,127 --> 00:32:31,427
Take not the Jews and Christians as allies.
Do you know it, Mr. Ferris?

429
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:40,438
The dar-al-Harb. Very good.

430
00:32:40,607 --> 00:32:44,373
We are together, Hani Pasha,
in this House of War, yes.

431
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:47,536
You are smarter than the Americans
who are usually sent to Amman.

432
00:32:47,714 --> 00:32:51,309
- Thank you, sir.
- I knew this, of course, before you came.

433
00:32:51,818 --> 00:32:55,219
You are young,
but you respect your elders.

434
00:32:55,388 --> 00:32:57,788
- You speak Arabic...
- Mm.

435
00:32:57,991 --> 00:33:00,653
...so you are a secret Arab.
- Mm.

436
00:33:08,735 --> 00:33:09,929
Now, ahem...

437
00:33:10,103 --> 00:33:12,936
We've recently discovered
a large Al-Saleem safe house...

438
00:33:13,106 --> 00:33:15,267
...and training cell here in Amman.

439
00:33:15,442 --> 00:33:17,535
I would need your help
with surveillance, sir.

440
00:33:19,045 --> 00:33:21,946
Now, this is what we know so far.

441
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,107
This is unusual.

442
00:33:25,685 --> 00:33:28,916
Your Ed Hoffman would rather have less
information than share with me.

443
00:33:29,823 --> 00:33:33,156
Well, this is not Ed Hoffman.
This is not my predecessor.

444
00:33:33,326 --> 00:33:36,159
This is me, sir. Please, have a look.

445
00:33:48,575 --> 00:33:50,406
I have one rule...

446
00:33:50,577 --> 00:33:53,171
...if we are to cooperate, my dear.

447
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,613
Never lie to me.

448
00:33:57,784 --> 00:33:59,615
Understand?

449
00:33:59,786 --> 00:34:01,583
Never lie to me.

450
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,990
You shall have your agents.

451
00:34:08,161 --> 00:34:09,958
Thank you, sir.

452
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:13,455
Agent Ferris is arriving at the site now.

453
00:34:13,633 --> 00:34:15,066
Thank you.

454
00:34:15,235 --> 00:34:18,261
Tracking now.
- Roger that, I'll reposition the aircraft.

455
00:34:18,438 --> 00:34:19,837
Slewing to 2.5.

456
00:34:29,549 --> 00:34:33,508
There it is. That's it.
That's the safe house.

457
00:34:39,025 --> 00:34:40,492
Come on.

458
00:34:46,499 --> 00:34:48,763
- What do you wanna do with this guy?
- Just watch.

459
00:34:48,935 --> 00:34:51,631
Watch him and what else?
- Nothing else.

460
00:34:52,939 --> 00:34:55,203
I'm not sure about this GID surveillance.

461
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:59,174
- I can't see any of Hani's guys.
- Well, I've spotted a few so far.

462
00:34:59,345 --> 00:35:02,837
You see the two by the doorway there
in front of the safe house?

463
00:35:03,016 --> 00:35:04,483
There's one more selling radios.

464
00:35:04,651 --> 00:35:07,381
And there's one behind me
with a striped shirt.

465
00:35:07,554 --> 00:35:09,044
That's what I've clocked so far.

466
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:14,552
Who's this? Who just sat down?

467
00:35:14,727 --> 00:35:16,319
That's one of our guys.

468
00:35:16,496 --> 00:35:19,693
- One of your guys? What do you...?
- A station asset.

469
00:35:19,866 --> 00:35:21,060
Zayed Ibishi.

470
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:24,231
He's one of our contacts
from the Palestinian camps.

471
00:35:24,404 --> 00:35:26,133
Station asset, huh?

472
00:35:26,306 --> 00:35:28,740
What the fuck is he doing
making contact right now?

473
00:35:28,908 --> 00:35:32,366
- And how come I don't know about this?
- I don't know. I don't know.

474
00:35:32,912 --> 00:35:37,008
If he makes that jihadist suspicious,
they will shut down that house and leave.

475
00:35:37,183 --> 00:35:40,619
- He's gonna get that guy killed.
- He's gonna blow this whole operation.

476
00:35:41,488 --> 00:35:43,183
Not again. Fucking Hoffman!

477
00:35:49,963 --> 00:35:52,295
- Oops.
- Continue tracking.

478
00:35:52,465 --> 00:35:53,625
Area expanded.

479
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,233
Tracking.

480
00:36:06,746 --> 00:36:08,805
Head him off! Head him off!

481
00:36:11,951 --> 00:36:14,078
Going down the alley.
- Adjusting coverage.

482
00:36:14,254 --> 00:36:15,278
Boost image factor.

483
00:36:21,461 --> 00:36:23,452
Switching to SAR.
- Stay with sweep.

484
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,093
Hold image?
- Image locked.

485
00:36:31,471 --> 00:36:32,597
Ah!

486
00:36:56,829 --> 00:36:59,559
Skip. I got him.

487
00:36:59,732 --> 00:37:02,166
I need you to come pick me up, all right?

488
00:37:02,335 --> 00:37:06,362
I got bit by fucking diseased dogs,
goddamn it.

489
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:08,507
I'm by the clearing.

490
00:37:08,675 --> 00:37:10,870
Yeah, just look out for me.

491
00:37:19,552 --> 00:37:22,521
You gotta be kidding me.
Come on, take me to a real hospital.

492
00:37:22,689 --> 00:37:24,884
- Take me to the embassy.
- That's like an hour.

493
00:37:25,058 --> 00:37:29,119
Rabies around here is no joke. You're gonna
need a jab in there, ASAP. Let's go.

494
00:37:29,295 --> 00:37:30,785
Let's go.

495
00:37:36,135 --> 00:37:39,161
Let's get you vaccinated. Aisha.

496
00:37:55,521 --> 00:37:56,545
AISHA

497
00:37:58,925 --> 00:38:00,358
Let me see.

498
00:38:03,429 --> 00:38:05,192
These are not bite wounds.

499
00:38:05,832 --> 00:38:08,596
- A snowboarding accident.
- Snowboarding.

500
00:38:08,768 --> 00:38:12,260
- Mm.
- You're accident prone, huh?

501
00:38:12,438 --> 00:38:16,374
Well, I mean,
I'm sure it looks that way. Yeah.

502
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:18,442
Okay.

503
00:38:25,051 --> 00:38:26,814
Relax.

504
00:38:27,987 --> 00:38:31,081
All right. Let me...

505
00:38:36,562 --> 00:38:39,588
My father was Iranian.

506
00:38:40,733 --> 00:38:43,031
I live in Amman now.

507
00:38:46,673 --> 00:38:48,607
Okay.

508
00:38:49,475 --> 00:38:51,443
This is going to hurt.

509
00:38:51,744 --> 00:38:53,678
Mm. I don't like needles.

510
00:38:53,846 --> 00:38:56,144
Just think about something else, hm?

511
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:01,043
Okay.

512
00:39:02,722 --> 00:39:07,284
This is the first of five anti-rabies injections
you'll need over the next month.

513
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,984
You don't need to come back here.

514
00:39:09,162 --> 00:39:13,326
You can get them at any clinic.
One each week, right?

515
00:39:13,866 --> 00:39:16,426
- So we're done?
- Yeah, we're done.

516
00:39:16,602 --> 00:39:19,400
And someone will come
to bandage your wounds.

517
00:39:20,807 --> 00:39:22,468
Thank you.

518
00:39:22,742 --> 00:39:25,870
<i>You fucking cocksucker. How did
you expect me to run an operation...</i>

519
00:39:26,045 --> 00:39:29,139
<i>...when you're running a side operation
which fucks up my own?</i>

520
00:39:29,315 --> 00:39:32,682
Listen, you want me to run Amman,
let me run Amman, all right?

521
00:39:32,852 --> 00:39:35,878
I have made promises to Hani Salaam.
Do you understand that?

522
00:39:36,055 --> 00:39:37,545
Uh-huh. What's your point?

523
00:39:37,724 --> 00:39:41,319
<i>My point is, Ed, you can't pull
your normal bullshit here, all right?</i>

524
00:39:41,494 --> 00:39:45,521
- We have to respect what he wants.
- I do respect him. What kind of thing?

525
00:39:45,698 --> 00:39:50,362
Look, you keep fucking around like this, and
you are gonna blow this Amman operation.

526
00:39:50,536 --> 00:39:52,936
- I love you. Bye.
- I love you too.

527
00:39:53,106 --> 00:39:56,667
They'll vacate their only known safe house,
and we'll never hear from them.

528
00:39:56,843 --> 00:39:59,243
- Do you understand?
- I'm just trying to back you up.

529
00:39:59,412 --> 00:40:01,471
It's a dangerous,
dangerous world out there.

530
00:40:01,647 --> 00:40:04,548
Well, don't back me up,
because I don't need it, all right?

531
00:40:05,084 --> 00:40:08,019
- Hani.
- I gotta go deal with this Hani bullshit.

532
00:40:08,187 --> 00:40:11,554
- So go fuck yourself.
- All right, whatever.

533
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:14,824
You ready to go?

534
00:40:14,994 --> 00:40:16,894
Whatever.

535
00:40:33,913 --> 00:40:36,814
Hani Pasha, if you would give me
an opportunity to ex...

536
00:40:38,184 --> 00:40:40,345
Fortunately the safe house is still there.

537
00:40:42,255 --> 00:40:45,281
As for the man you killed,
you were right.

538
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:47,255
You made a good decision.

539
00:40:47,827 --> 00:40:51,627
The jihadists believe it was a robbery.
There are many robberies in that district.

540
00:40:51,798 --> 00:40:54,460
So you have been very clever, my dear.

541
00:40:54,634 --> 00:40:57,000
Well, that's good news, sir.

542
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,694
Listen, Ed Hoffman had...

543
00:40:58,871 --> 00:41:01,999
I have spoken to Mr. Hoffman
very sharply.

544
00:41:02,175 --> 00:41:05,042
Now, we will explain
the king's espionage laws to his agent.

545
00:41:25,431 --> 00:41:28,832
I thought you didn't believe in torture,
Hani Pasha.

546
00:41:29,001 --> 00:41:32,596
This is punishment, my dear.
It's a very different thing.

547
00:41:37,276 --> 00:41:39,176
Keep watching.

548
00:41:40,379 --> 00:41:42,438
Tell Edward what you have seen.

549
00:42:58,891 --> 00:43:01,382
<i>Another deadly attack on innocent civilians.</i>

550
00:43:01,561 --> 00:43:05,497
<i>This time in one of Amsterdam's
most crowded tourist districts.</i>

551
00:43:05,665 --> 00:43:09,226
<i>The images of the bombing were captured
on location surveillance cameras.</i>

552
00:43:09,402 --> 00:43:11,529
<i>The blast felt for miles.</i>

553
00:43:11,704 --> 00:43:15,003
<i>What was once a block-long farmer market
vibrant with color...</i>

554
00:43:15,174 --> 00:43:16,801
<i>...is now in ruins and covered with ash.</i>

555
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:21,444
<i>The exact number of casualties
is not yet known...</i>

556
00:43:21,614 --> 00:43:24,139
<i>...as emergency crews
are still pulling victims from the rubble.</i>

557
00:43:24,317 --> 00:43:28,310
<i>But officials are saying it will certainly be
in triple figures.</i>

558
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:32,757
<i>KLPD antiterror-unit investigators
have arrived...</i>

559
00:43:32,925 --> 00:43:36,622
<i>...and are examining bomb fragments
in the hope of determining if this...</i>

560
00:43:36,796 --> 00:43:41,062
<i>...and the other recent bombings on the
continent and in the UK are connected.</i>

561
00:43:41,233 --> 00:43:45,602
<i>The consequence of a new bombing
will no doubt have a devastating effect...</i>

562
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:48,069
<i>...on Europe's tourist business.</i>

563
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,767
<i>Let's go now
to Amsterdam's chief of police.</i>

564
00:43:51,944 --> 00:43:56,711
<i>We will do whatever we can
to keep everyone safe...</i>

565
00:43:56,882 --> 00:44:00,318
<i>...for you to live every day
without being afraid.</i>

566
00:44:00,486 --> 00:44:02,681
<i>But we must be realistic.</i>

567
00:44:02,855 --> 00:44:08,384
<i>Terrorist threats are real, present,
deadly and persistent.</i>

568
00:44:11,364 --> 00:44:13,798
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

569
00:44:15,935 --> 00:44:16,959
Where are we going?

570
00:44:17,136 --> 00:44:19,036
We are going fishing.

571
00:44:19,205 --> 00:44:20,763
Get in.

572
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,412
Since no credit was claimed
for the bombing...

573
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:33,347
...we believe it to be the work
of Al-Saleem.

574
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:35,987
That's his signature. Anonymity.

575
00:44:37,023 --> 00:44:39,423
So, what we need is... May I say we?

576
00:44:39,592 --> 00:44:43,050
Of course.
As long as we keep it between us.

577
00:44:43,729 --> 00:44:46,061
We need a man inside the Amman cell.

578
00:44:46,232 --> 00:44:47,699
We do. Yes.

579
00:44:47,867 --> 00:44:49,459
And we shall have the man we need.

580
00:44:49,635 --> 00:44:53,298
- How's that?
- Because you gave him to me.

581
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:58,273
<i>His name is Mustafa Karami.
I've known him since he was a teenager...</i>

582
00:44:58,444 --> 00:45:01,311
<i>...selling boom boxes
from the back of a stolen truck.</i>

583
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,176
<i>Now he's al Qaeda. In my country.</i>

584
00:45:05,518 --> 00:45:07,145
<i>Watch and learn, my dear.</i>

585
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:08,581
Watch and learn.

586
00:45:44,623 --> 00:45:45,954
KARAMI:

587
00:45:47,426 --> 00:45:50,293
You did not think to tell Hani Salaam
you are a jihadist?

588
00:45:51,497 --> 00:45:54,762
You have become a religious man, hm?

589
00:45:54,934 --> 00:45:56,526
No longer a thief.

590
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:59,233
Can it be true?

591
00:46:00,372 --> 00:46:01,532
Here.

592
00:46:03,409 --> 00:46:04,603
Take the phone.

593
00:46:04,777 --> 00:46:07,211
Take it and talk to your mother.

594
00:46:07,847 --> 00:46:09,314
Talk.

595
00:46:12,384 --> 00:46:14,545
<i>Hello? Hello?
- Hello.</i>

596
00:46:16,255 --> 00:46:19,588
His mother was in the Palestinian camps.

597
00:46:19,759 --> 00:46:23,320
Now she has a fine apartment
and a beautiful garden.

598
00:46:23,496 --> 00:46:26,829
She can watch the sun set over the hills.

599
00:46:26,999 --> 00:46:32,096
She has a refrigerator, couch,
even a television set.

600
00:46:32,271 --> 00:46:36,139
She will tell him she is proud of him, that
she always knew he would be a success...

601
00:46:36,308 --> 00:46:38,833
...even when he was a little boy
in the refugee camps.

602
00:46:39,011 --> 00:46:40,945
And now he has sent her money.

603
00:46:41,113 --> 00:46:43,274
She is glad he is no longer mixed up
with the radicals.

604
00:46:57,496 --> 00:47:00,590
You are God's blessing to your mother,
Mustafa.

605
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,235
You have done none of these things for her.
But you should have.

606
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:07,971
A mother is worth more
than anything they have told you.

607
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:12,509
You know, you will be better in the future
because we have sent her many gifts...

608
00:47:12,678 --> 00:47:15,272
...and we have told her these gifts come
from her son.

609
00:47:19,752 --> 00:47:21,185
HANI:

610
00:47:22,021 --> 00:47:24,546
Continue your life with your brothers
in al Qaeda.

611
00:47:24,723 --> 00:47:26,918
We will devise a way to talk. Come.

612
00:47:28,594 --> 00:47:31,722
Come. No, no, no. Come, come, come.

613
00:47:31,897 --> 00:47:34,593
Up, up, up.

614
00:47:37,603 --> 00:47:38,900
Go.

615
00:47:45,344 --> 00:47:48,905
And so we throw him back into the sea,
to swim where he naturally swims...

616
00:47:49,081 --> 00:47:51,845
...to learn what he naturally learns...

617
00:47:52,017 --> 00:47:54,747
...and see how long he remembers
my benevolence.

618
00:47:56,222 --> 00:47:57,621
And what if he forgets?

619
00:47:58,791 --> 00:48:02,955
If he forgets, I remind him that I have
the power of life and death over him...

620
00:48:03,128 --> 00:48:07,531
...because, you see, any time I wish,
I can let them know he works for me.

621
00:48:08,767 --> 00:48:10,064
Hm.

622
00:48:12,838 --> 00:48:13,964
<i>Ed?</i>

623
00:48:14,139 --> 00:48:16,004
<i>So tell me about Hani's guy.</i>

624
00:48:16,175 --> 00:48:18,075
<i>- Who?
- Karami, the guy on the bike.</i>

625
00:48:18,244 --> 00:48:20,678
<i>What do you think I do in my spare time,
play tennis?</i>

626
00:48:20,846 --> 00:48:24,009
<i>- I look like a tennis player to you?
- It's not gonna happen, Ed.</i>

627
00:48:24,183 --> 00:48:28,085
<i>Buddy, we're a results-oriented
organization, and we need results now...</i>

628
00:48:28,254 --> 00:48:30,154
<i>...because otherwise I will be unhappy.</i>

629
00:48:30,322 --> 00:48:32,586
<i>You'll be unhappy, and he'll say, "Insa. "</i>

630
00:48:32,758 --> 00:48:33,850
<i>What does that mean?</i>

631
00:48:34,026 --> 00:48:35,857
Means "too fucking bad,"
is what it means.

632
00:48:36,028 --> 00:48:39,395
<i>Too fucking bad?
Europe is getting hammered, boy. All right?</i>

633
00:48:39,565 --> 00:48:41,658
<i>Nobody knows where the next bomb
is going off.</i>

634
00:48:41,834 --> 00:48:43,825
<i>There's 75 dead in Amsterdam.</i>

635
00:48:44,003 --> 00:48:46,437
<i>You can call me sentimental
if you want to, buddy...</i>

636
00:48:46,605 --> 00:48:48,334
Ed, listen, Hani does not trust you.

637
00:48:48,507 --> 00:48:50,498
Arabs will only help you if they trust you.

638
00:48:50,676 --> 00:48:52,644
We need to earn that trust,
you understand?

639
00:48:52,811 --> 00:48:54,005
<i>What are you, moving here?</i>

640
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:58,377
<i>I don't care about cultural insecurity issues.
I don't care if Hani trusts me or not.</i>

641
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:01,212
<i>What he will do is he will thank me
in the long run. Fuck.</i>

642
00:49:01,387 --> 00:49:03,378
<i>Hold on. Hold on.</i>

643
00:49:05,024 --> 00:49:06,821
Buddy, you're home.

644
00:49:08,227 --> 00:49:11,128
Jesus Christ, Ed,
you scared the shit out of me.

645
00:49:11,297 --> 00:49:14,061
They say that you should
never drink red wine in the desert.

646
00:49:14,233 --> 00:49:16,201
That's what did in the Babylonians, right?

647
00:49:16,368 --> 00:49:20,202
Well, a couple of bottles of that
and we'll be speaking Babylonian.

648
00:49:20,372 --> 00:49:23,239
So how was your flight?

649
00:49:23,409 --> 00:49:27,243
<i>Oh, it was fine. It was fine.
Yeah. I watched that Poseidon.</i>

650
00:49:28,614 --> 00:49:31,742
I see you've made yourself at home.

651
00:49:46,231 --> 00:49:48,791
In the words of the great Sam Snead:

652
00:49:48,968 --> 00:49:53,064
"If you're not thinking about pussy,
you're just not concentrating. "

653
00:49:53,238 --> 00:49:54,398
My dear.

654
00:49:54,573 --> 00:49:56,370
Jesus Christ. Come on.

655
00:49:59,111 --> 00:50:00,669
Hani Pasha.

656
00:50:00,846 --> 00:50:02,279
Thank you for your time.

657
00:50:02,448 --> 00:50:03,710
Please.

658
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:07,842
I'm gonna need a piece of this guy you got
here in this Amman cell.

659
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,580
Don't look at buddy.
Buddy didn't say nothing.

660
00:50:10,756 --> 00:50:14,624
These jihadists might not use their cell
phones, Hani, but you do use yours, right?

661
00:50:15,294 --> 00:50:16,318
Please.

662
00:50:16,495 --> 00:50:19,430
Now, don't say no before I say anything.

663
00:50:19,598 --> 00:50:22,226
Just let me say
what I've come here to say.

664
00:50:23,168 --> 00:50:28,401
Thank you. You have done an incredible job
developing this guy Karoobi.

665
00:50:29,308 --> 00:50:30,536
Katoomi.

666
00:50:30,709 --> 00:50:32,336
- Karami.
- Karami.

667
00:50:32,511 --> 00:50:37,005
Now, we develop these assets
to use them as needed.

668
00:50:37,182 --> 00:50:38,410
And I have a need.

669
00:50:39,318 --> 00:50:41,149
No.

670
00:50:44,156 --> 00:50:47,648
- I'm just gonna get all frustrated here.
- Why are you frustrated, Edward?

671
00:50:47,826 --> 00:50:49,487
Because we have a partnership.

672
00:50:49,661 --> 00:50:51,993
You have something that I need
that will help me...

673
00:50:52,164 --> 00:50:53,791
...and you won't allow that to happen.

674
00:50:53,966 --> 00:50:57,129
And I'm trying to impress upon you
a sense of urgency.

675
00:50:57,302 --> 00:51:01,796
Urgency does not call for changing methods
that work for methods that do not work.

676
00:51:02,674 --> 00:51:04,733
Now, who pays the bills around here?

677
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:07,777
I would hate to have to have my president
call your king.

678
00:51:07,946 --> 00:51:10,506
Because that's just gonna
be embarrassing for all of us.

679
00:51:10,682 --> 00:51:14,448
In matters of intelligence, Edward,
you are speaking to the king.

680
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,383
- Is that right?
- Mm.

681
00:51:17,189 --> 00:51:20,955
Well, Your Highness, I want control.

682
00:51:21,126 --> 00:51:24,823
- As a favor to the United States.
- You can't have it.

683
00:51:25,964 --> 00:51:30,025
I could tell you we will run him jointly,
but it would not be the truth.

684
00:51:30,202 --> 00:51:34,434
Real intelligence operations,
they remain secret forever.

685
00:51:35,441 --> 00:51:40,572
You Americans, you are incapable
of secrecy because you are a democracy.

686
00:51:40,746 --> 00:51:43,909
Now, I know my business.

687
00:51:44,083 --> 00:51:46,517
I have never failed you, have I?

688
00:51:46,685 --> 00:51:51,952
No, you have not. Are you sure
you wanna make this the first time?

689
00:51:52,157 --> 00:51:54,990
Edward, you're missing the point.

690
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,025
Karami, he doesn't know anything.

691
00:51:57,196 --> 00:51:59,664
That is not the way
the organization operates.

692
00:51:59,832 --> 00:52:04,030
I will ask him what he knows
when it is time.

693
00:52:04,203 --> 00:52:07,570
- Now, are you happy?
- I'm getting there.

694
00:52:09,374 --> 00:52:11,672
Now, you guys
might have invented algebra...

695
00:52:11,844 --> 00:52:14,176
...but we're the guys
that found out how to use it.

696
00:52:14,346 --> 00:52:17,406
I presume you know who that is?

697
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:19,483
It's a recent photograph of Al-Saleem.

698
00:52:19,651 --> 00:52:21,915
You didn't have that one, did you?

699
00:52:22,087 --> 00:52:24,851
Well, that's yours.
You can keep that because we're partners.

700
00:52:25,023 --> 00:52:28,891
All right? Now, I'm fulfilling my side
of the bargain, okay?

701
00:52:29,061 --> 00:52:32,497
Now's the time for some reciprocity.

702
00:52:34,032 --> 00:52:35,897
You need to give me Karami.

703
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:42,964
<i>Insa.</i>

704
00:52:44,243 --> 00:52:49,044
- That's, "Too fucking bad. "
- I know what that means.

705
00:52:49,915 --> 00:52:52,110
Well, that was
fucking embarrassing, hm?

706
00:52:53,018 --> 00:52:55,009
You still thinking about pussy, Ed?

707
00:52:55,187 --> 00:52:59,453
Don't be a smart aleck.
Thing about that Hani, he's bright.

708
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:02,025
But he's also arrogant.
That's gonna be his undoing.

709
00:53:02,194 --> 00:53:04,424
You're talking about him, right?

710
00:53:04,596 --> 00:53:05,790
Just flow with me, buddy.

711
00:53:05,964 --> 00:53:09,661
Jesus Christ. You have a recent photograph
of Al-Saleem.

712
00:53:09,835 --> 00:53:12,463
Don't you think I could've used intel
like that, Ed?

713
00:53:12,638 --> 00:53:15,106
What the hell else
are you holding back from me?

714
00:53:15,274 --> 00:53:16,332
What do you wanna know?

715
00:53:16,508 --> 00:53:18,476
Well, for one thing, what's his real name?

716
00:53:18,644 --> 00:53:21,306
Kareem Al-Shams.

717
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,513
His birthplace?

718
00:53:23,682 --> 00:53:26,583
Syria. Hama.

719
00:53:27,686 --> 00:53:29,381
Background?

720
00:53:29,555 --> 00:53:33,958
Well, his loving middle-class family
got killed by Hafez Assad...

721
00:53:34,126 --> 00:53:36,424
<i>...so he moved to Saudi Arabia.</i>

722
00:53:36,595 --> 00:53:41,055
<i>Studied physics and engineering in Riyadh,
then here in Amman.</i>

723
00:53:41,233 --> 00:53:45,033
<i>Post-graduate study at the University of
North Carolina. He's a Tar Heel like you.</i>

724
00:53:45,204 --> 00:53:49,072
<i>Now, he prides himself on his humility
and not having to take the credit.</i>

725
00:53:49,241 --> 00:53:52,699
<i>Yet this is the same man who will go
on videotape with his brothers...</i>

726
00:53:52,878 --> 00:53:55,608
<i>...describing what he's done
and what's gonna come.</i>

727
00:53:55,781 --> 00:53:58,807
<i>His is a false humility.
It's a false modesty.</i>

728
00:53:58,984 --> 00:54:02,511
<i>His ego is more powerful than his beliefs,
more dangerous.</i>

729
00:54:02,688 --> 00:54:04,349
<i>And that is his weakness.</i>

730
00:54:04,523 --> 00:54:10,052
<i>Now, all we got to do, Ferris,
is just get that fucker on the phone.</i>

731
00:54:14,499 --> 00:54:15,523
Ed?

732
00:54:15,701 --> 00:54:17,328
Yeah.

733
00:54:17,502 --> 00:54:21,939
Don't do anything about Karami, huh?
Don't try to flip him or anything like that.

734
00:54:22,107 --> 00:54:24,268
Hani will throw me out.
I promise you that.

735
00:54:24,443 --> 00:54:26,172
This operation will be over.

736
00:54:27,279 --> 00:54:30,976
You cannot trust Hani. Am I clear?

737
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:33,681
You're clear.

738
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:38,217
Good. You and I gotta get drunk
because I need to sleep on the plane.

739
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:41,791
<i>I have to take the kids
to The Lion King. Again.</i>

740
00:54:43,061 --> 00:54:44,323
Never have kids.

741
00:54:45,664 --> 00:54:49,156
- Ed, did you hear what I said, right?
- Oh, yeah.

742
00:54:49,334 --> 00:54:53,634
- Don't... Don't touch Karami.
- All right.

743
00:54:54,172 --> 00:54:56,072
Never.

744
00:55:12,491 --> 00:55:14,857
That's Karami. We're on. Get the van.

745
00:55:46,792 --> 00:55:48,953
Move the fucking van!

746
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:53,796
Go! Go, go, go!

747
00:56:00,572 --> 00:56:01,596
Fuck!

748
00:56:13,118 --> 00:56:16,781
I thought I told you
you could get this at any clinic.

749
00:56:16,955 --> 00:56:21,415
And you should have had
your injection yesterday.

750
00:56:21,593 --> 00:56:23,857
You weren't on duty yesterday.

751
00:56:24,029 --> 00:56:28,159
Besides, when you find a good doctor,
you don't change, right?

752
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:29,527
I'm not a doctor.

753
00:56:33,905 --> 00:56:35,805
The same thing. You don't change.

754
00:56:37,175 --> 00:56:38,199
Wife.

755
00:56:38,377 --> 00:56:41,278
Well, I don't have a ring.

756
00:56:41,446 --> 00:56:43,971
No, but you did last week.

757
00:56:44,182 --> 00:56:46,548
Ah. So you noticed?

758
00:56:47,919 --> 00:56:49,386
Bad husband.

759
00:56:50,122 --> 00:56:53,250
Ah! Yes. Ahem.
Yes, I was a bad husband.

760
00:56:53,425 --> 00:56:55,723
And she was an even worse wife...

761
00:56:55,894 --> 00:56:58,761
...which is why we're divorced now.

762
00:56:58,930 --> 00:56:59,954
It's over.

763
00:57:03,135 --> 00:57:05,660
And now you're looking
for something else, huh?

764
00:57:06,371 --> 00:57:09,397
Something as different from her
as you can find.

765
00:57:09,574 --> 00:57:13,237
Something close to impossible.

766
00:57:13,412 --> 00:57:15,039
We're done.

767
00:57:15,981 --> 00:57:17,471
Till next week.

768
00:57:25,457 --> 00:57:27,084
May I?

769
00:57:27,259 --> 00:57:29,454
Yes.

770
00:57:30,362 --> 00:57:32,853
I was wondering if maybe...

771
00:57:33,031 --> 00:57:36,967
...you wanted to have a conversation
sooner than next week.

772
00:57:37,135 --> 00:57:40,502
<i>Maybe, inshallah, later this afternoon...</i>

773
00:57:40,672 --> 00:57:42,867
...if that wouldn't make you
uncomfortable.

774
00:57:44,242 --> 00:57:48,338
Well, for you and me
to be able to do that...

775
00:57:48,513 --> 00:57:50,947
...first we would have
to have a conversation...

776
00:57:51,116 --> 00:57:53,880
...about the proper way
to have a conversation.

777
00:57:54,986 --> 00:57:56,977
Anyway, where I'm going
this afternoon...

778
00:57:57,155 --> 00:58:00,352
...would make you more uncomfortable
than me.

779
00:58:00,525 --> 00:58:03,517
Well, I doubt that.

780
00:58:03,695 --> 00:58:05,526
I don't.

781
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,652
WOMAN

782
00:58:43,301 --> 00:58:47,032
If you're trying to figure out how far I'll go
in order to express my interest...

783
00:58:47,205 --> 00:58:49,639
...I think you have the answer.

784
00:58:50,475 --> 00:58:52,705
- Do I?
- Mm.

785
00:58:52,878 --> 00:58:56,143
What else are you supposed to do
at this point? Leave here alone?

786
00:58:56,715 --> 00:58:59,650
You're safer with me and you know it.

787
00:58:59,818 --> 00:59:01,786
What are you asking?

788
00:59:01,953 --> 00:59:04,421
I'm asking what you do here.

789
00:59:05,123 --> 00:59:06,818
Well, I'm a political adviser.

790
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,751
Who snowboards in Amman.

791
00:59:09,928 --> 00:59:12,453
- That's right.
- Yeah, yeah.

792
00:59:12,631 --> 00:59:16,567
Listen, I have a thing to tell you,
an important one.

793
00:59:16,735 --> 00:59:20,068
A man is not his job.

794
00:59:20,238 --> 00:59:23,503
I mean, he's apart from his job. The man.

795
00:59:23,675 --> 00:59:25,506
I understand.

796
00:59:25,677 --> 00:59:28,669
No, I just want you
to know my feeling, my...

797
00:59:28,847 --> 00:59:31,680
My understanding of you.

798
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:34,182
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

799
00:59:43,595 --> 00:59:46,086
May I see you again, Aisha?

800
00:59:54,606 --> 00:59:56,972
When you wish
and with your permission, of course.

801
00:59:57,142 --> 01:00:00,703
Where did you learn to speak Arabic
like this?

802
01:00:01,613 --> 01:00:04,207
Yeah, yeah, we are friends.

803
01:00:04,382 --> 01:00:05,644
We may talk again.

804
01:00:06,651 --> 01:00:08,312
We may.

805
01:00:08,486 --> 01:00:10,750
Well, thank you.

806
01:00:26,338 --> 01:00:28,033
He's my friend.

807
01:00:29,975 --> 01:00:32,671
- It's fine. It's fine.
- You sure?

808
01:00:33,878 --> 01:00:35,209
It's fine.

809
01:00:36,881 --> 01:00:38,041
What's this all about?

810
01:02:08,373 --> 01:02:10,933
Marwan showed you the burning house?

811
01:02:11,843 --> 01:02:13,105
Do you know what happened?

812
01:02:13,278 --> 01:02:15,644
I have absolutely no idea.

813
01:02:16,815 --> 01:02:20,717
You see, you could have said
to me yes or no. Simply that.

814
01:02:20,885 --> 01:02:25,049
When a man says to me more
than yes or no, then I begin to wonder.

815
01:02:25,223 --> 01:02:28,317
I don't know what happened, Hani.

816
01:02:30,795 --> 01:02:35,323
We had the advantage.
That house could have led us to Al-Saleem.

817
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:38,060
Now it is gone.
Everything inside it is gone.

818
01:02:38,236 --> 01:02:39,965
Here. Kneel.
- Hani, listen to me, I...

819
01:02:40,138 --> 01:02:42,663
I told you never to lie to me.

820
01:02:42,841 --> 01:02:44,638
I am not lying to you, Hani.

821
01:02:44,809 --> 01:02:48,074
You did not know that this man,
after everything I said to you...

822
01:02:48,246 --> 01:02:51,409
...everything I said to Edward,
that he tried to take Karami?

823
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:54,982
He did not know.

824
01:02:55,153 --> 01:02:57,383
When I want to speak with you,
I will look at you.

825
01:02:58,923 --> 01:03:00,390
Now I am talking to Mr. Ferris.

826
01:03:01,426 --> 01:03:04,259
So in as few words as possible...

827
01:03:04,896 --> 01:03:06,227
...did you know?

828
01:03:06,965 --> 01:03:08,728
No.

829
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,925
I don't believe you.

830
01:03:11,703 --> 01:03:14,035
You have 12 hours to leave Jordan.

831
01:03:14,205 --> 01:03:17,504
If I find you here,
I will not be responsible for your safety.

832
01:03:17,675 --> 01:03:19,142
Do you understand me?

833
01:03:35,026 --> 01:03:37,722
Now, you knew you needed
to adapt to this environment.

834
01:03:37,896 --> 01:03:40,387
Ferris, I know, but, you know, I...

835
01:03:47,739 --> 01:03:48,933
Ferris!

836
01:03:55,213 --> 01:03:56,680
Ferris!

837
01:04:13,998 --> 01:04:17,490
Well, hey, buddy. Back from the sandbox?

838
01:04:17,669 --> 01:04:19,967
Enjoying civilization?
You wanna get a hot dog?

839
01:04:20,138 --> 01:04:23,505
How do you expect me to operate, Ed,
when you're keeping all the cards?

840
01:04:23,675 --> 01:04:26,508
- What about an ice cream?
- All Hani wanted was patience, Ed.

841
01:04:26,678 --> 01:04:29,340
- Patience. Not as a personal quality...
- I don't care.

842
01:04:29,514 --> 01:04:33,177
Not as a personal quality, but an operational
requirement, and you can't do it?

843
01:04:33,351 --> 01:04:36,809
You're too power hungry and greedy.
You fucked this whole operation up!

844
01:04:36,988 --> 01:04:39,320
For chrissakes,
I thought Hani wanted to kill me!

845
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:40,650
Oh, don't exaggerate.

846
01:04:40,825 --> 01:04:44,488
Hani don't want to kill you.
He likes you. He likes you a lot.

847
01:04:44,662 --> 01:04:48,826
And who is he gonna get over there
better for him than you? Nobody.

848
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:52,326
Don't worry. You're gonna
be back in Jordan before you know it.

849
01:04:52,503 --> 01:04:54,664
Back with your Jordanian
piece of poontang...

850
01:04:54,839 --> 01:04:57,603
...that you think I don't know about,
but I do.

851
01:04:57,775 --> 01:05:00,471
You're a fat fucking piece of shit,
you know that, Ed?

852
01:05:00,645 --> 01:05:03,443
We do this shit for a living,
go on a diet, for chrissakes.

853
01:05:03,615 --> 01:05:07,949
Are you quite finished?
Now, I did what I had to do.

854
01:05:09,153 --> 01:05:11,747
<i>I ain't got time to play
Patience, Sidi, Patience...</i>

855
01:05:11,923 --> 01:05:14,187
...and sit around eating couscous.

856
01:05:16,761 --> 01:05:20,356
Hani's interests extend only
to his own little fiefdom.

857
01:05:20,531 --> 01:05:21,964
Mine are global.

858
01:05:23,635 --> 01:05:25,125
Now, having said that...

859
01:05:25,303 --> 01:05:30,605
...I admit that perhaps, possibly, I should
have, from an operational standpoint...

860
01:05:30,775 --> 01:05:32,970
...brought you into what I was doing.
- Exactly.

861
01:05:33,144 --> 01:05:36,511
What you should've done was listen
to what Hani said, and you know that.

862
01:05:40,084 --> 01:05:42,882
You know, 10 years ago,
I could've beat the crap out of you.

863
01:05:43,054 --> 01:05:45,318
Should've taken the shot
when you had the chance.

864
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:47,685
Maybe I should've. Can't do it now.

865
01:05:48,793 --> 01:05:52,320
What we need to do,
with or without the cooperation of Hani...

866
01:05:52,497 --> 01:05:56,297
...is get our own man
inside Al-Saleem's tent.

867
01:05:57,568 --> 01:06:00,503
We could penetrate every goddamn
Salafi mosque in the world...

868
01:06:00,672 --> 01:06:02,902
...and still not even get close.

869
01:06:07,478 --> 01:06:10,038
- But Al-Saleem doesn't know that, right?
- What?

870
01:06:10,214 --> 01:06:14,207
He doesn't know that.
I mean, he doesn't know what we can't do.

871
01:06:14,385 --> 01:06:16,410
He doesn't know how close
or how far we are.

872
01:06:16,587 --> 01:06:18,487
He doesn't know what's true
or what isn't.

873
01:06:18,656 --> 01:06:22,524
I mean... Look, Osama fed Zarqawi
to the dogs...

874
01:06:22,694 --> 01:06:24,787
...because he was getting
too powerful, right?

875
01:06:24,963 --> 01:06:27,261
- Right.
- What if instead of tracking Al-Saleem...

876
01:06:27,432 --> 01:06:30,560
...like we're doing right now
with absolutely no results...

877
01:06:30,735 --> 01:06:34,535
...we make it appear that there
is another terrorist operation out there...

878
01:06:34,706 --> 01:06:36,401
...just as effective as his own?

879
01:06:36,574 --> 01:06:40,476
I mean, how would Al-Saleem react
to that kind of challenge to his stats?

880
01:06:40,645 --> 01:06:43,136
- What would he do?
- He would get paranoid.

881
01:06:43,314 --> 01:06:45,908
- He might rejoice. Maybe both.
- Exactly.

882
01:06:46,084 --> 01:06:48,848
But either way,
he'd try to get in contact with them, right?

883
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:51,545
- Right.
- Which would be us.

884
01:06:52,557 --> 01:06:54,422
That would be us.

885
01:06:55,693 --> 01:06:58,719
You're a devious SOB.

886
01:06:58,896 --> 01:07:02,388
- We can't do this out of Langley.
- No. No, sir.

887
01:07:22,854 --> 01:07:25,914
Garland. Roger Ferris.
Pleased to meet you.

888
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:27,489
Where's Hoffman?

889
01:07:27,658 --> 01:07:29,922
I don't know. Ben & Jerry's.

890
01:07:32,997 --> 01:07:35,022
He trusts you.

891
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:40,068
I don't trust him. Every time we run
an operation and I don't see Hoffman...

892
01:07:40,238 --> 01:07:43,173
...it means he's running
another operation. Coffee?

893
01:07:43,341 --> 01:07:46,139
Yes, please. Black. Thank you.

894
01:07:47,011 --> 01:07:50,674
- Fruit? Strawberries, plums, apples?
- No, thanks.

895
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:55,178
We're tracking a cell in Syria.
Last night, they were in Damascus.

896
01:07:55,353 --> 01:07:59,483
Today, Dayr Az-Zawr and the Iraqi border.

897
01:07:59,657 --> 01:08:02,854
But something tells me
they won't make it to Hasbaya.

898
01:08:03,027 --> 01:08:07,555
We have ninjas waiting.

899
01:08:07,732 --> 01:08:10,496
Who do these ninjas work for?

900
01:08:10,668 --> 01:08:12,101
Me.

901
01:08:12,270 --> 01:08:13,999
Shall we?

902
01:08:21,712 --> 01:08:24,909
So where is everyone?

903
01:08:25,083 --> 01:08:27,017
Absolutely no idea what you mean.

904
01:08:27,185 --> 01:08:32,851
- What? You mean it's just you?
- No. It's me and you.

905
01:08:33,024 --> 01:08:35,959
Did you think there'd be some
war room with lights flashing...

906
01:08:36,127 --> 01:08:37,526
...and people with clipboards?

907
01:08:37,695 --> 01:08:40,789
No, it's all here and here and here.
And here.

908
01:08:40,965 --> 01:08:43,661
Sure you won't have a strawberry?
They're really delicious.

909
01:08:43,835 --> 01:08:46,201
Yeah, no, I'm positive.

910
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:50,500
Look, I'm gonna need some really, really
low-level al Qaeda contacts, all right?

911
01:08:50,675 --> 01:08:54,475
No one too extreme. Picture somewhere
in between Osama and Oprah.

912
01:08:54,645 --> 01:08:55,771
You get my drift?

913
01:08:55,947 --> 01:08:59,212
I'm gonna need a security consultant,
a lawyer.

914
01:08:59,383 --> 01:09:02,511
I'm gonna need an Arab who travels
throughout the region, all right?

915
01:09:02,687 --> 01:09:07,056
A businessman. Someone who fits the role
of jihadist without actually being jihadist.

916
01:09:07,225 --> 01:09:08,385
A straw man.

917
01:09:09,794 --> 01:09:13,525
Receiving money, making plans.

918
01:09:13,698 --> 01:09:15,598
That kind of thing.

919
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,425
Okay, no.

920
01:09:18,603 --> 01:09:20,332
No.

921
01:09:20,505 --> 01:09:21,733
No.

922
01:09:23,241 --> 01:09:25,903
Hang on. There you go.
Second from the top.

923
01:09:26,077 --> 01:09:28,944
Omar Sadiki. He's Jordanian.
He's an architect.

924
01:09:29,847 --> 01:09:33,749
Most of his commissions
are from charitable Islamic groups...

925
01:09:33,918 --> 01:09:35,783
...who then give money to the jihadists.

926
01:09:35,953 --> 01:09:38,421
So he ticks all the jihadist boxes...

927
01:09:38,589 --> 01:09:41,456
...except he's innocent.

928
01:09:41,626 --> 01:09:44,493
So he touches his head to the floor
five times a day.

929
01:09:44,662 --> 01:09:47,222
He believes in God.

930
01:09:47,398 --> 01:09:50,629
So why would he trade
with an infidel like myself?

931
01:09:52,637 --> 01:09:53,797
Money.

932
01:10:16,194 --> 01:10:18,424
Mr. Sadiki.

933
01:10:21,065 --> 01:10:22,692
Hello, Mr. Sadiki.

934
01:10:22,867 --> 01:10:26,166
Mr. Sadiki, it's Brad Scanlon
from Hayes Andover Bank.

935
01:10:26,337 --> 01:10:28,635
I'm following up on my email.

936
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,264
Yeah.

937
01:10:30,441 --> 01:10:33,274
Yeah, well, listen,
I got into Dubai a little bit early.

938
01:10:33,444 --> 01:10:39,405
I'm staying at the Jumeirah Emirates
Towers, but I can meet you anywhere.

939
01:10:39,584 --> 01:10:41,279
Well, fantastic.

940
01:10:48,659 --> 01:10:50,092
Anything else to know?

941
01:10:50,261 --> 01:10:51,853
Exactly as we discussed.

942
01:10:52,296 --> 01:10:53,320
I'm cool with that.

943
01:10:53,497 --> 01:10:55,965
- I'm used to knowing nothing.
- I'm sure you are, Tony.

944
01:10:56,133 --> 01:10:58,727
- Just get in position.
- Okay, boss.

945
01:11:00,871 --> 01:11:02,668
Mr. Sadiki.
- Yeah.

946
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:07,709
Hayes Andover's option to buy this property
is gonna expire by the end of the month.

947
01:11:07,878 --> 01:11:10,039
We're hoping to get some sketches
and a bid...

948
01:11:10,214 --> 01:11:12,910
...by, say, next Thursday
before the Islamic weekend.

949
01:11:13,084 --> 01:11:15,018
Well, I think...

950
01:11:15,186 --> 01:11:16,551
- Yes, certainly.
- Hm.

951
01:11:16,721 --> 01:11:19,690
You'll also have to sign a letter of intent
with Mr. Al-Masri...

952
01:11:19,857 --> 01:11:21,415
...if that's okay with you.

953
01:11:21,592 --> 01:11:23,184
- Makes no difference to me.
- Great.

954
01:11:23,361 --> 01:11:28,196
- Allah will decide if I get the job or not.
- Fantastic.

955
01:11:28,366 --> 01:11:30,163
Mr. Al-Masri?

956
01:11:30,701 --> 01:11:31,725
Mr. Omar Sadiki.

957
01:11:38,376 --> 01:11:40,936
- Would anyone like some coffee?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

958
01:11:41,112 --> 01:11:44,445
<i>Ed, Al-Masri
is a lawyer we found with al Qaeda ties.</i>

959
01:11:44,615 --> 01:11:47,516
<i>He's fairly low on the map,
but he is on the map...</i>

960
01:11:47,685 --> 01:11:51,314
<i>...enough for a photograph
to suggest Sadiki's guilt by association.</i>

961
01:11:51,489 --> 01:11:53,684
Mm-hm. You have his computer?

962
01:11:54,425 --> 01:11:56,484
Yeah, look,
I'm gonna go get it right now.

963
01:11:56,661 --> 01:11:59,357
He's going to the Cyclone Club.
He loves the Russian girls.

964
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:02,090
I'll call you soon. Call you soon.

965
01:12:03,367 --> 01:12:05,028
Three-sixteen.

966
01:12:48,212 --> 01:12:49,270
Come on, baby.

967
01:12:55,186 --> 01:12:56,517
- Garland?
- Yeah?

968
01:12:56,687 --> 01:12:58,450
<i>Stand by. All right?</i>

969
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:02,452
Just getting in right now.

970
01:13:12,536 --> 01:13:15,528
Ah. This is useful.

971
01:13:16,207 --> 01:13:18,368
Very useful.

972
01:13:18,542 --> 01:13:23,411
I have an e-mail list of the members
of the Brothers of Awareness.

973
01:13:23,581 --> 01:13:25,640
<i>The Brothers of who-the-fuck?</i>

974
01:13:25,816 --> 01:13:29,479
The Ikhwan Ishfan. They're just a study
group of believers at his local mosque.

975
01:13:29,653 --> 01:13:31,621
But I can make it look like anything.

976
01:13:31,789 --> 01:13:34,986
All right. Let's make it look
like everything, huh?

977
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:46,462
Now, make fake accounts
for half a dozen of the brothers...

978
01:13:46,637 --> 01:13:50,505
<i>...and start transferring money to them
from Sadiki's fake receiver account.</i>

979
01:13:50,674 --> 01:13:52,574
<i>Just small operational sums.</i>

980
01:13:52,743 --> 01:13:54,040
Okay.

981
01:13:57,715 --> 01:14:01,378
The Saudis will pick up the money moving,
and everything they pick up...

982
01:14:01,552 --> 01:14:03,986
They'll leak to the jihadists.

983
01:14:04,155 --> 01:14:07,921
<i>- You got it, my friend.
- It's coming up. Now it's done.</i>

984
01:14:45,796 --> 01:14:47,593
Dad! Dad!

985
01:14:48,466 --> 01:14:50,764
Hey, baby. Hold on. Oh.

986
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:55,770
<i>Hey, Ed, you there?
- Where are you?</i>

987
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:58,306
Dubai International. I'm on my way back.

988
01:14:58,476 --> 01:15:01,377
No, no, no. No, you're not.
You're going back to Amman.

989
01:15:01,946 --> 01:15:04,642
- Hani called, asked where you were.
- Jesus Christ.

990
01:15:04,815 --> 01:15:07,841
If you don't go back,
he's gonna wonder why you didn't go back.

991
01:15:08,018 --> 01:15:10,213
I think he likes you, buddy.
Change your ticket.

992
01:15:10,387 --> 01:15:13,356
- All right, Ed. I'm on my way.
- All right.

993
01:15:13,524 --> 01:15:16,288
- Oh, hey. Can I get that for you?
- Thank you.

994
01:15:23,834 --> 01:15:26,394
Mr. Ferris. Welcome.

995
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:28,731
- Thank you.
- Come.

996
01:15:39,917 --> 01:15:44,854
I wanted to see you to tell you
I was sorry how we left things.

997
01:15:45,322 --> 01:15:48,780
- I was upset.
- Well, you had every right to be upset, sir.

998
01:15:48,959 --> 01:15:50,790
I apologize for what happened.

999
01:15:51,829 --> 01:15:53,888
But I am happy you are back.

1000
01:15:54,698 --> 01:15:57,166
Miss Aisha, too, I think,
will be happy you are back.

1001
01:15:58,035 --> 01:16:02,301
Don't worry, we're not watching you.
We're watching out for you.

1002
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,669
But I need you to understand, you
cannot afford any more mistakes in Jordan.

1003
01:16:07,711 --> 01:16:10,942
This is a part of the world
where friendship matters.

1004
01:16:11,749 --> 01:16:13,683
It can save your life.

1005
01:16:13,884 --> 01:16:17,786
Why don't I call you back in about
15 minutes with all the information?

1006
01:16:17,955 --> 01:16:20,219
Well, thanks so much, Mr. Sadiki.

1007
01:16:21,325 --> 01:16:23,190
Let's get something clear, all right?

1008
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,487
I'm not tolerating any more
of your bullshit.

1009
01:16:25,663 --> 01:16:27,688
- No, it's cool.
- Who do you work for?

1010
01:16:27,865 --> 01:16:30,959
- I work for you. I got the call, I got briefed.
- All right, good.

1011
01:16:31,135 --> 01:16:33,729
- Front? Back?
- Take my bag.

1012
01:16:45,015 --> 01:16:49,645
If you're going to insist on coming here
to see me...

1013
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:52,254
...which is what you're doing...

1014
01:16:52,423 --> 01:16:56,018
...my sister's going to want to meet you.

1015
01:16:57,695 --> 01:16:59,253
Your sister?

1016
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:04,094
Yeah, my sister looks after me
in matters that are non-medical.

1017
01:17:06,203 --> 01:17:10,503
Oh, so she has to approve of me
before you will begin to.

1018
01:17:11,809 --> 01:17:15,506
I would like her to think so,
whenever I can.

1019
01:17:17,681 --> 01:17:18,705
Okay.

1020
01:17:53,683 --> 01:17:55,378
- Hi.
- Hi.

1021
01:17:55,552 --> 01:17:56,883
I'm still cooking.

1022
01:17:57,053 --> 01:17:59,749
- Come in.
- I brought some dessert, pastry.

1023
01:17:59,923 --> 01:18:02,084
Oh, the kids are going to love it.

1024
01:18:02,258 --> 01:18:03,384
- The kids?
- Yeah.

1025
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:06,085
- Aha.
- Come.

1026
01:18:08,465 --> 01:18:11,696
This is my sister, Cala.

1027
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:14,394
Mr. Ferris.

1028
01:18:15,839 --> 01:18:20,173
And these are my nephews,
Yousef and Rowley.

1029
01:18:20,343 --> 01:18:21,867
Hello.

1030
01:18:22,045 --> 01:18:23,603
Yousef. Rowley. Hey.

1031
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:25,179
Hi.
- Hi.

1032
01:18:25,348 --> 01:18:27,908
- Nephews.
- Yeah, my nephews.

1033
01:18:34,057 --> 01:18:36,321
Smells good in there, huh?

1034
01:18:36,493 --> 01:18:38,518
It's not good.

1035
01:18:41,431 --> 01:18:42,796
It's not good?

1036
01:18:42,966 --> 01:18:45,935
- You don't like your mother's cooking?
- No, not really.

1037
01:18:46,269 --> 01:18:47,293
Oh.

1038
01:18:53,643 --> 01:18:55,770
What kind of food do you like?

1039
01:18:55,945 --> 01:18:57,435
Hamburgers.

1040
01:18:57,614 --> 01:18:59,844
- You?
- Spaghettis.

1041
01:19:00,016 --> 01:19:01,711
Me too.

1042
01:19:01,885 --> 01:19:06,015
So if there's anything that I wouldn't like,
would you two let me know?

1043
01:19:07,924 --> 01:19:09,186
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1044
01:19:09,359 --> 01:19:10,417
Cool.

1045
01:19:23,706 --> 01:19:26,903
So, Mr. Ferris...

1046
01:19:27,444 --> 01:19:29,571
...how long are you in Amman?

1047
01:19:30,346 --> 01:19:31,404
Oh, uh, ahem.

1048
01:19:31,581 --> 01:19:35,540
Well, I think I'm gonna be for a while.
I hope so, anyway.

1049
01:19:38,254 --> 01:19:40,484
Where were you stationed before?

1050
01:19:41,925 --> 01:19:42,983
Riyadh.

1051
01:19:44,027 --> 01:19:45,221
- Riyadh?
- Hm.

1052
01:19:49,899 --> 01:19:52,299
What do you do exactly?

1053
01:19:52,535 --> 01:19:56,596
I told you, Cala, he's a political adviser.

1054
01:19:56,773 --> 01:19:58,832
Political adviser.

1055
01:19:59,008 --> 01:20:02,205
But what does that mean?
Forgive my ignorance.

1056
01:20:02,378 --> 01:20:05,142
- It means, uh...
- It means that I...

1057
01:20:05,315 --> 01:20:10,048
Well, I offer my assistance to
His Majesty's advisers whenever they ask.

1058
01:20:15,925 --> 01:20:18,894
But you do this now, not before the war.

1059
01:20:19,062 --> 01:20:21,895
Before you didn't consult with us at all.

1060
01:20:22,065 --> 01:20:25,330
- Cala, please, we are just having lunch.
- It's okay.

1061
01:20:25,502 --> 01:20:26,867
- It's okay.
- We can talk...

1062
01:20:27,036 --> 01:20:29,903
- I'm talking with your friend.
- Talk about another subject.

1063
01:20:30,073 --> 01:20:31,836
It's quite all right. I understand.

1064
01:20:32,008 --> 01:20:35,341
And we understand
that the situation in Iraq...

1065
01:20:35,512 --> 01:20:39,608
...has created many hardships
for the Jordanian people.

1066
01:20:40,283 --> 01:20:42,274
- The situation?
- You mean, the war.

1067
01:20:42,452 --> 01:20:44,943
- He means war.
- No, no, no, he says the situation.

1068
01:20:45,121 --> 01:20:46,816
- What do you mean?
- You know what...

1069
01:20:46,990 --> 01:20:48,252
Please.

1070
01:20:48,424 --> 01:20:52,360
I mean the roadside bombings,
the assassination of Iraqi police...

1071
01:20:52,529 --> 01:20:54,997
...the kidnappings,
the crowded marketplaces...

1072
01:20:55,164 --> 01:20:58,531
...and innocent families that have
been wiped off the face of the Earth.

1073
01:20:58,701 --> 01:21:01,033
That's what I mean
by the situation in Iraq.

1074
01:21:05,074 --> 01:21:07,907
I can tell you what
His Majesty's thinking.

1075
01:21:09,045 --> 01:21:12,503
His Majesty believes the best hope
for the war is that it ends.

1076
01:21:13,082 --> 01:21:15,573
Well, I can tell you
that is my hope as well.

1077
01:21:16,252 --> 01:21:18,243
I hope so too. Huh?

1078
01:21:18,421 --> 01:21:22,357
Cala? Hey. Peace.

1079
01:21:22,525 --> 01:21:25,221
- Let's have lunch, huh?
- Okay.

1080
01:21:25,395 --> 01:21:26,919
Enjoy.

1081
01:21:27,096 --> 01:21:28,654
Thank you.

1082
01:21:31,868 --> 01:21:34,359
- Well, sorry about that.
- Ah, so am I.

1083
01:21:34,537 --> 01:21:38,200
I probably should've kept my mouth shut.
After all, I was a guest in your home.

1084
01:21:38,374 --> 01:21:40,604
So is she. It didn't stop her, you know?

1085
01:21:40,777 --> 01:21:44,110
She suffered a lot during Iran-Iraq war.

1086
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:48,307
And the funny thing
is that she wants to live in America.

1087
01:21:48,484 --> 01:21:49,542
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1088
01:21:49,719 --> 01:21:53,052
Well, tell her I'll switch passports with her.
It'll make us both happy.

1089
01:21:53,222 --> 01:21:55,122
Don't joke about these kind of things.

1090
01:21:55,291 --> 01:22:00,058
I'm not joking. I'm perfectly serious.
I may stay here forever. Really.

1091
01:22:01,698 --> 01:22:04,963
Well, anyway, I'm glad I made friends
with her boys. I like them a lot.

1092
01:22:05,134 --> 01:22:06,965
Yeah, they're great, aren't they?

1093
01:22:07,136 --> 01:22:10,367
But not very good spies, you know?
Neither are you.

1094
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:11,564
What do you mean?

1095
01:22:11,741 --> 01:22:13,208
- At the table, you know?
- Oh.

1096
01:22:13,977 --> 01:22:16,810
So you noticed. All right. I'm busted.

1097
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:19,972
Well, thank you, Aisha,
for inviting me in your home.

1098
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:21,742
Um...

1099
01:22:27,523 --> 01:22:29,184
Sorry.

1100
01:22:29,993 --> 01:22:32,188
- I had a really nice time.
- Sorry. Yeah, me too.

1101
01:22:33,062 --> 01:22:36,259
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

1102
01:22:46,376 --> 01:22:50,574
The photograph was taken last week
in the Cyclone Club in Dubai.

1103
01:22:50,747 --> 01:22:52,339
One is Al-Masri, a lawyer...

1104
01:22:52,515 --> 01:22:57,452
...a low-level al Qaeda financier,
if that's not a contradiction in terms.

1105
01:22:57,620 --> 01:23:00,054
The other is a Jordanian.

1106
01:23:00,223 --> 01:23:02,919
An architect named Omar Sadiki.

1107
01:23:04,193 --> 01:23:05,888
No known terrorist ties.

1108
01:23:06,062 --> 01:23:11,932
Now, the question I ask myself is,
is what are they doing together?

1109
01:23:16,806 --> 01:23:19,798
Is this Sadiki more than he claims to be?

1110
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:21,570
He travels a lot.

1111
01:23:22,011 --> 01:23:24,946
He builds mosques and shopping malls.

1112
01:23:25,114 --> 01:23:28,049
At the very least,
he bears examination by us.

1113
01:23:28,217 --> 01:23:30,208
Or by we.

1114
01:23:30,653 --> 01:23:32,086
Hm.

1115
01:23:33,723 --> 01:23:34,985
Where'd you get these?

1116
01:23:35,992 --> 01:23:38,256
- A friend in Saudi Intelligence.
- Mm.

1117
01:23:38,961 --> 01:23:40,394
Useful friend, huh?

1118
01:23:49,572 --> 01:23:51,005
No, keep it.

1119
01:23:51,674 --> 01:23:53,733
I want you to have it.

1120
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:57,277
We are partners. Allies, no?

1121
01:23:58,314 --> 01:24:01,147
Why would we not want
to help each other?

1122
01:24:01,317 --> 01:24:04,411
Right. Thank you.

1123
01:24:04,887 --> 01:24:06,650
<i>Garland.
- Yeah?</i>

1124
01:24:06,823 --> 01:24:09,883
<i>Pull up an Arabic keyboard
and write down this message, you ready?</i>

1125
01:24:10,059 --> 01:24:11,083
Okay.

1126
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:13,728
In the name of Go...
No, you know what, strike that.

1127
01:24:13,896 --> 01:24:16,296
In the name of God the merciful...

1128
01:24:16,466 --> 01:24:18,957
<i>...we praise our brothers
who shall carry out...</i>

1129
01:24:19,135 --> 01:24:21,501
<i>...this heroic act in the fig orchard...</i>

1130
01:24:21,671 --> 01:24:24,765
...and beg God to give us strength
for our continuing struggle.

1131
01:24:24,941 --> 01:24:27,171
The time is at hand. All right?

1132
01:24:27,343 --> 01:24:31,302
Now, that's absolutely delightful Arabic,
but what the fuck is the fig orchard?

1133
01:24:31,481 --> 01:24:34,450
<i>I can't let you in on that yet.
Let's just say it's developing.</i>

1134
01:24:34,617 --> 01:24:35,811
It'll create chatter...

1135
01:24:35,985 --> 01:24:39,443
...but it's gotta be big enough
for Al-Saleem, to get his attention.

1136
01:24:39,889 --> 01:24:41,049
Oh, it'll be big.

1137
01:24:41,224 --> 01:24:44,057
Now, send that off
from Sadiki's fake e-mail address...

1138
01:24:44,227 --> 01:24:45,888
<i>...and we are in business.</i>

1139
01:24:46,062 --> 01:24:47,324
Okay. Done.

1140
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:03,037
<i>Advise when you're on the deck.</i>

1141
01:25:14,023 --> 01:25:16,992
<i>Hello there, Mr. Sadiki.
It's Brad Scanlon.</i>

1142
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:20,823
I'm fine. Thanks so much for asking.
But we've got a bit of a problem.

1143
01:25:20,997 --> 01:25:23,795
You see, our chief engineer,
who's based out of Ankara...

1144
01:25:23,966 --> 01:25:27,527
...he's raised some issues
about the insulation.

1145
01:25:27,703 --> 01:25:30,501
I realize it's the same stuff
that you use in Saudi Arabia...

1146
01:25:30,673 --> 01:25:34,234
...but he's asked
to meet with you immediately.

1147
01:25:34,410 --> 01:25:37,345
No, I'm sorry, sir.
He cannot fly up to see you.

1148
01:25:37,513 --> 01:25:40,710
And the only time he can meet
is tomorrow afternoon.

1149
01:25:40,883 --> 01:25:44,785
But the good news is, we have a car
ready to pick you up in about...

1150
01:25:44,954 --> 01:25:49,618
...oh, six hours, and a plane ticket to Turkey
waiting for you at the airport.

1151
01:25:50,426 --> 01:25:53,395
No, I'm sorry, sir.
First class was not available.

1152
01:25:54,497 --> 01:25:56,692
<i>Ed, Sadiki just landed in Turkey.</i>

1153
01:25:56,866 --> 01:25:58,697
<i>He's being met by one of our guys.</i>

1154
01:25:58,868 --> 01:26:02,395
<i>An engineer to discuss business
and to show him a good time.</i>

1155
01:26:02,572 --> 01:26:05,006
<i>All we need is to establish
that he is there.</i>

1156
01:26:05,208 --> 01:26:07,199
<i>- Mm-hm.
- Now, the barracks at the base...</i>

1157
01:26:07,376 --> 01:26:09,344
<i>...have been cleared out of all personnel.</i>

1158
01:26:09,512 --> 01:26:11,605
<i>Bodies from the morgue
have been brought in.</i>

1159
01:26:11,781 --> 01:26:14,682
<i>They'll be our so-called casualties.</i>

1160
01:26:14,851 --> 01:26:19,220
<i>Now, Garland will send out a message
from Sadiki hinting that a strike is prepared.</i>

1161
01:26:19,388 --> 01:26:20,787
And when the strike is done...

1162
01:26:20,957 --> 01:26:24,552
...he'll post another message taking
responsibility for our little event.

1163
01:26:24,727 --> 01:26:26,695
- You got that?
- Uh-huh.

1164
01:26:26,863 --> 01:26:28,125
<i>After that...</i>

1165
01:26:28,297 --> 01:26:31,994
...hopefully a buzz of messages
will then pass among jihadists' networks...

1166
01:26:32,168 --> 01:26:36,264
<i>...announcing the Brothers of Awareness
as a new player.</i>

1167
01:26:36,439 --> 01:26:39,101
And our Sadiki as its leader.
You got that?

1168
01:26:39,275 --> 01:26:40,936
<i>All right, Ferris. Thank you.</i>

1169
01:26:41,110 --> 01:26:42,475
<i>Tony, you have a go.</i>

1170
01:26:49,919 --> 01:26:51,682
<i>We have a special report.</i>

1171
01:26:51,854 --> 01:26:54,914
<i>A massive explosion
has taken place in Incirlik, Turkey.</i>

1172
01:26:55,091 --> 01:26:58,219
<i>Officials have confirmed the
target of the blast to be the U.S. Air Base...</i>

1173
01:26:59,595 --> 01:27:03,292
<i>...at Incirlik, Turkey. The bomb ripped
through the Bachelor Officers' Quarters...</i>

1174
01:27:03,466 --> 01:27:05,627
<i>...at 3:00 this morning,
quickly engulfing it in flames.</i>

1175
01:27:07,169 --> 01:27:09,797
<i>No one yet has claimed responsibility
for the attack.</i>

1176
01:27:09,972 --> 01:27:13,669
<i>But terror experts are already speculating
this is the work of a new...</i>

1177
01:27:13,843 --> 01:27:17,438
<i>...much more sophisticated and much
better financed offshoot of al Qaeda...</i>

1178
01:27:17,613 --> 01:27:20,047
<i>...than that which is responsible
for the bombings...</i>

1179
01:27:20,216 --> 01:27:22,980
<i>...in Amsterdam, London
and other European cities.</i>

1180
01:27:23,152 --> 01:27:24,983
<i>In contrast to these recent bombings...</i>

1181
01:27:25,154 --> 01:27:28,612
<i>...this is the first attack
to occur on American property.</i>

1182
01:27:28,791 --> 01:27:30,053
<i>- The Pentagon...
- Honey.</i>

1183
01:27:30,226 --> 01:27:33,753
<i>...will not release the names of the dead
until notification of next of kin.</i>

1184
01:27:33,930 --> 01:27:36,660
<i>We're also being told that there
may never be a public announcement...</i>

1185
01:27:36,832 --> 01:27:37,856
Honey.

1186
01:27:38,034 --> 01:27:40,161
<i>...of the list of casualties
since some of the men killed...</i>

1187
01:27:40,336 --> 01:27:43,203
<i>...may have been stationed at Incirlik
on classified missions.</i>

1188
01:27:43,372 --> 01:27:47,240
<i>Incirlik, which in Turkish means fig orchard,
has served since September the 11 th...</i>

1189
01:27:47,410 --> 01:27:50,868
<i>...as a primary hub in the wars
in Afghanistan and Iraq.</i>

1190
01:27:51,047 --> 01:27:54,505
All right, now send out the message
taking credit.

1191
01:27:54,684 --> 01:27:58,381
But make the responses go back
to Sadiki's actual account.

1192
01:27:58,554 --> 01:28:01,045
<i>- You got that?
- Okay.</i>

1193
01:28:06,028 --> 01:28:10,658
I can't say it's been real,
but you know what I mean.

1194
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:12,358
Yeah.

1195
01:28:29,118 --> 01:28:33,077
AL-SALEEM

1196
01:29:04,518 --> 01:29:06,645
SADIKI:

1197
01:31:46,547 --> 01:31:48,242
<i>Hey there, little buddy.</i>

1198
01:31:48,782 --> 01:31:52,548
<i>Well done. You did it.
NSA's picking up all kinds of chatter.</i>

1199
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:53,880
<i>Haven't heard for years.</i>

1200
01:31:54,054 --> 01:31:58,013
One voice on a world phone out of Vienna
sounds a lot like Al-Saleem himself.

1201
01:31:58,192 --> 01:32:01,719
<i>Saying something along the lines of,
"Who the damn heck is Omar Sadiki?"</i>

1202
01:32:01,895 --> 01:32:06,059
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen,
I made a decision, Ed. I'm bringing him in.

1203
01:32:06,233 --> 01:32:08,895
<i>- Who?
- Omar Sadiki, that's who.</i>

1204
01:32:09,069 --> 01:32:10,627
Oh, come on. No, no, no.

1205
01:32:10,804 --> 01:32:14,433
When they find him, they are gonna
torture him and they are gonna kill him.

1206
01:32:14,608 --> 01:32:18,305
You gotta decide which side of the cross
you're on. I need nailers, not hangers.

1207
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:20,811
Decision's already done, Ed.
I'm bringing him in.

1208
01:32:20,981 --> 01:32:23,950
Ain't nobody innocent
in this shit, Ferris. Okay?

1209
01:32:25,185 --> 01:32:26,209
Ferris.

1210
01:32:27,054 --> 01:32:29,852
All right, don't move until I say, all right?

1211
01:32:35,629 --> 01:32:37,096
<i>You got me?</i>

1212
01:32:43,804 --> 01:32:45,294
Omar.

1213
01:32:45,472 --> 01:32:48,236
It's Brad Scanlon.
We need to have a conversation. Come on.

1214
01:32:48,409 --> 01:32:50,309
What are you doing here?

1215
01:32:55,516 --> 01:32:58,576
Fuck! Omar! Omar, open the door!

1216
01:32:58,752 --> 01:32:59,810
Let's go!

1217
01:32:59,987 --> 01:33:02,353
Omar, listen to me!

1218
01:33:02,523 --> 01:33:04,115
Omar! Omar!

1219
01:33:04,792 --> 01:33:07,022
Let's go! Go, go, go!

1220
01:33:19,773 --> 01:33:21,263
Fuck!

1221
01:33:28,816 --> 01:33:31,683
This is Roger Ferris. I need an ambulance.

1222
01:34:41,889 --> 01:34:43,880
LIEUTENANT:

1223
01:35:33,207 --> 01:35:34,970
Yeah.

1224
01:35:35,142 --> 01:35:37,269
<i>Sadiki is dead.</i>

1225
01:35:38,245 --> 01:35:39,906
<i>You there?</i>

1226
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,445
Yeah, I'm here.

1227
01:35:41,615 --> 01:35:43,515
I didn't kill him, buddy.

1228
01:35:43,684 --> 01:35:44,844
<i>I know you didn't, Ed.</i>

1229
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:48,044
I did.

1230
01:35:48,222 --> 01:35:51,817
Oh, buddy.
Buddy, that's just not constructive. Okay?

1231
01:35:51,992 --> 01:35:54,927
- Then what is?
- Doing exactly what you're doing.

1232
01:35:55,095 --> 01:35:58,861
And how are you measuring that? By how
much closer you've gotten to Al-Saleem?

1233
01:35:59,032 --> 01:36:02,297
I bet you heard a shitload of chatter,
then it stopped, didn't it?

1234
01:36:02,469 --> 01:36:03,766
That's right.

1235
01:36:03,937 --> 01:36:05,928
<i>Well, then where is Al-Saleem?</i>

1236
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:09,308
- Hm?
- Ferris.

1237
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:12,342
You know what? I've had it.

1238
01:36:12,512 --> 01:36:14,446
I've had it. I can't do this anymore.

1239
01:36:15,215 --> 01:36:16,239
Yes, you can.

1240
01:36:16,416 --> 01:36:19,044
Now, you just get yourself
a couple of hours' sleep.

1241
01:36:19,219 --> 01:36:21,119
And call me
when you're thinking straight.

1242
01:36:21,288 --> 01:36:25,224
You know what? I am thinking straight.
You're not, all right?

1243
01:36:25,392 --> 01:36:28,122
You can't, because you're
a million fucking miles away.

1244
01:36:28,295 --> 01:36:29,762
I'm here, Ed, every day.

1245
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:32,262
And I see the unnecessary travesties
of this war...

1246
01:36:32,432 --> 01:36:35,868
<i>...that the rest of you backstabbing
political fucking bureaucrats...</i>

1247
01:36:36,036 --> 01:36:37,333
<i>...only look at pictures of.</i>

1248
01:36:37,504 --> 01:36:40,803
So don't you dare tell me
I am not fucking thinking straight!

1249
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:44,571
This is not working, all right?

1250
01:36:44,745 --> 01:36:46,804
<i>It's not working. I'm out.</i>

1251
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:48,971
Ferris?

1252
01:36:49,149 --> 01:36:51,140
Ferris?

1253
01:36:54,421 --> 01:36:56,446
I should pack.

1254
01:37:14,975 --> 01:37:17,034
Fuck.

1255
01:37:22,582 --> 01:37:24,174
Fuck!

1256
01:37:43,537 --> 01:37:45,095
Shit!

1257
01:37:45,772 --> 01:37:47,763
Move the fucking car!

1258
01:38:55,475 --> 01:38:57,204
- Where's Marwan? Marwan?
- Mr. Ferris.

1259
01:38:57,377 --> 01:38:58,935
Please.

1260
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:03,144
Please, please.
I just need a moment of his time, all right?

1261
01:39:03,316 --> 01:39:05,113
Okay.

1262
01:39:10,824 --> 01:39:12,348
Please?

1263
01:39:14,094 --> 01:39:16,028
Please excuse me.

1264
01:39:22,903 --> 01:39:24,666
What is it?

1265
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:33,970
I invented Omar Sadiki.

1266
01:39:34,147 --> 01:39:37,310
It was my operation.
He is not a jihadist, all right?

1267
01:39:37,484 --> 01:39:41,580
I moved him around, I moved money around,
and then I lost him.

1268
01:39:41,755 --> 01:39:44,155
- That is impossible.
- Why?

1269
01:39:44,324 --> 01:39:48,385
Because it will mean that you sat
in my office and you lied to my face.

1270
01:39:48,562 --> 01:39:52,362
Hani, I promise I will share
all the information with you, all right?

1271
01:39:52,532 --> 01:39:55,865
But they have kidnapped a friend of mine
in order to get to me.

1272
01:39:56,036 --> 01:39:58,436
Now, you know exactly
who I'm talking about, Hani.

1273
01:39:58,605 --> 01:40:02,041
Please, they're gonna execute her,
all right?

1274
01:40:02,209 --> 01:40:04,677
Please, help me broker a deal, her for me.

1275
01:40:04,845 --> 01:40:06,813
You lied to me.

1276
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:08,447
I will not help you.

1277
01:40:08,615 --> 01:40:10,913
- The answer is no.
- Please, Hani.

1278
01:40:11,084 --> 01:40:13,552
Hani. Hani!

1279
01:40:32,205 --> 01:40:33,638
Ed.

1280
01:40:33,807 --> 01:40:36,776
You should've told me about the girl.
We could've watched her.

1281
01:40:36,943 --> 01:40:38,843
They left the phone.
I know how this goes.

1282
01:40:39,012 --> 01:40:41,139
They've got Aisha
and they want someone.

1283
01:40:41,314 --> 01:40:45,080
- If she's alive.
- She has to be alive, right?

1284
01:40:45,552 --> 01:40:48,646
Well, she's probably alive.
At least, they want you to think so.

1285
01:40:48,822 --> 01:40:51,017
- That's the good part.
- And what's the bad part?

1286
01:40:51,191 --> 01:40:52,658
They know about you.

1287
01:40:52,826 --> 01:40:55,954
They know you work for the agency.
That tells me two things.

1288
01:40:56,129 --> 01:40:58,654
One, the people that have Aisha
are running the show...

1289
01:40:58,832 --> 01:41:00,356
...so they're close to Al-Saleem.

1290
01:41:00,534 --> 01:41:03,594
Two, they have learned enough
from Aisha to know she's your pal.

1291
01:41:03,770 --> 01:41:05,738
- She's been interrogated.
- Goddamn it.

1292
01:41:05,906 --> 01:41:08,306
- You cannot take this to Hani, right?
- Right. Right.

1293
01:41:08,475 --> 01:41:12,070
- Does that mean you already have?
- Yes. Yes, sir, I have.

1294
01:41:12,245 --> 01:41:13,269
Why would you do that?

1295
01:41:13,446 --> 01:41:15,346
I have to trust everyone I can right now.

1296
01:41:15,515 --> 01:41:17,915
All you gotta do is trust me.

1297
01:41:18,451 --> 01:41:19,884
<i>- What'd he say?
- He said, "Ma'alesh. "</i>

1298
01:41:20,053 --> 01:41:22,021
Because I lied to him,
he's not gonna help.

1299
01:41:29,896 --> 01:41:32,296
Okay. We set this up,
we're gonna do it right.

1300
01:41:32,465 --> 01:41:35,525
- It's not just about you and your girlfriend.
- All right.

1301
01:41:37,804 --> 01:41:41,604
This is Roger Ferris.
Will you put Aisha on the phone?

1302
01:41:41,775 --> 01:41:44,608
<i>Okay, mister. Thanks God you are calling.</i>

1303
01:41:44,778 --> 01:41:48,111
<i>I have a question
to make sure you are you. Please.</i>

1304
01:41:48,281 --> 01:41:49,305
Fine.

1305
01:41:49,482 --> 01:41:51,712
<i>Where do you meet Miss Aisha first time?</i>

1306
01:41:51,885 --> 01:41:56,481
<i>At a medical clinic in Amman.
She's a nurse.</i>

1307
01:41:56,656 --> 01:41:59,591
<i>Where do you take Miss Aisha
for dinner first time?</i>

1308
01:41:59,759 --> 01:42:01,556
Go, go.

1309
01:42:01,761 --> 01:42:03,092
Uh...

1310
01:42:03,263 --> 01:42:07,199
I didn't. She invited me
to her apartment for dinner.

1311
01:42:07,367 --> 01:42:08,857
<i>Did you bring anything?</i>

1312
01:42:10,604 --> 01:42:12,333
<i>I did.</i>

1313
01:42:13,139 --> 01:42:15,903
A dessert pastry.

1314
01:42:16,076 --> 01:42:19,170
<i>If you want to see Miss Aisha,
you must go where I say.</i>

1315
01:42:19,813 --> 01:42:23,772
<i>Trade you for her.
No trick or Miss Aisha will die.</i>

1316
01:42:23,950 --> 01:42:25,542
Tell me where I'm to go.

1317
01:42:26,019 --> 01:42:27,577
<i>I'll tell you where to go.</i>

1318
01:42:27,754 --> 01:42:30,689
<i>It is near the border. Highway 15.</i>

1319
01:42:30,857 --> 01:42:33,883
<i>Between Al-Saidi and Mahbrouk.</i>

1320
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:35,891
<i>That's where you go. Bye.</i>

1321
01:43:14,167 --> 01:43:15,532
Passport.

1322
01:45:08,047 --> 01:45:09,241
Bring up Pacman feed.

1323
01:45:09,416 --> 01:45:11,145
Increase magnification eight time.

1324
01:45:11,317 --> 01:45:13,376
Eight-time mag.

1325
01:45:14,421 --> 01:45:15,581
Enhance resolution.

1326
01:45:33,273 --> 01:45:36,731
Holding at mid-altitude orbit, 12,500...

1327
01:45:46,152 --> 01:45:48,052
<i>Still holding for vector angle.</i>

1328
01:45:59,232 --> 01:46:01,928
Still holding for vector angle.
- Switching over to SAR.

1329
01:46:24,624 --> 01:46:26,421
Which one do you want us to follow?

1330
01:46:30,763 --> 01:46:32,230
Which one, sir?

1331
01:46:33,533 --> 01:46:35,626
<i>Sir?</i>

1332
01:46:35,802 --> 01:46:37,793
Sorry, buddy.

1333
01:48:07,427 --> 01:48:10,828
Salaam, CIA.

1334
01:48:15,201 --> 01:48:16,691
I am not the sheik.

1335
01:48:16,869 --> 01:48:20,236
The sheik, God praise him,
is the sheik who always was.

1336
01:48:20,406 --> 01:48:22,203
I am his servant.

1337
01:48:24,110 --> 01:48:26,340
Where is the girl?

1338
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:28,841
Either you're trying to be clever...

1339
01:48:29,015 --> 01:48:33,145
...or someone has done to you
what you so often do to them.

1340
01:48:33,319 --> 01:48:35,150
Lie.

1341
01:48:35,888 --> 01:48:38,220
So you paid for me? Hm?

1342
01:48:38,391 --> 01:48:40,018
Not as much as I would have.

1343
01:48:40,627 --> 01:48:43,926
Such a bargain for such a catch as you.

1344
01:48:44,097 --> 01:48:48,534
Well, it wasn't a bargain, because
no one's gonna negotiate with you for me.

1345
01:48:48,701 --> 01:48:52,467
That's not our policy. There will be
no exchanges. You understand that, right?

1346
01:48:52,639 --> 01:48:56,268
There will be no negotiation,
but not because you say so.

1347
01:48:57,076 --> 01:48:59,772
I have an agent of the CIA.

1348
01:49:00,346 --> 01:49:04,783
And that's what I came to see.
And that's what matters.

1349
01:49:06,185 --> 01:49:07,447
In this world...

1350
01:49:07,620 --> 01:49:12,717
...there's enough poverty and frustration
and anger and passion.

1351
01:49:12,892 --> 01:49:15,656
There will never be a shortage of martyrs.

1352
01:49:16,429 --> 01:49:20,058
Just like these men, huh?
These men who are dispensable to you.

1353
01:49:20,233 --> 01:49:23,634
These men who blow themselves up
in the name of Allah...

1354
01:49:23,803 --> 01:49:26,328
...who kill their own
brothers and sisters, huh?

1355
01:49:26,506 --> 01:49:30,499
There is no place in the Koran for
the murder of innocent people and suicide.

1356
01:49:30,677 --> 01:49:32,804
- You know that.
- It's a good try.

1357
01:49:33,246 --> 01:49:37,910
But the Koran's sayings...
You speak Arabic, no?

1358
01:49:48,494 --> 01:49:52,430
So you misinterpret the one book
you believe in, hm?

1359
01:49:52,865 --> 01:49:54,457
But are you pure...

1360
01:49:54,634 --> 01:49:59,071
...or are you just as corrupt as the capitalist
Westerners that you despise?

1361
01:49:59,238 --> 01:50:01,331
To me, you are fucking slaves.

1362
01:50:01,507 --> 01:50:05,568
You're slaves to the Saudi oil sheiks
and the Wahabi oil money that funds you.

1363
01:50:05,745 --> 01:50:07,872
And when that oil money runs out,
my friends...

1364
01:50:08,047 --> 01:50:12,177
...you will all fucking disappear
into the ashes of history.

1365
01:50:12,351 --> 01:50:15,411
I am not going to torture you, Mr. Ferris.

1366
01:50:15,588 --> 01:50:19,854
I see you're not going to read
what is prepared for you on paper.

1367
01:50:20,026 --> 01:50:21,050
It's all right.

1368
01:50:21,794 --> 01:50:25,560
All I need from you, I already have.

1369
01:50:25,732 --> 01:50:28,257
You know what that camera is for?

1370
01:50:28,835 --> 01:50:32,396
It's not for this. This...
This is intermission.

1371
01:50:33,072 --> 01:50:38,874
It's for what comes after this.
For what comes now.

1372
01:50:48,387 --> 01:50:49,820
Kareem.

1373
01:50:50,723 --> 01:50:52,714
But you paid who for me?

1374
01:50:52,892 --> 01:50:55,588
An intermediary who works for who?

1375
01:50:55,762 --> 01:50:58,322
You don't know who
and that should concern you.

1376
01:50:58,498 --> 01:51:01,558
- Do I look concerned?
- Well, that's what surprises me.

1377
01:51:01,734 --> 01:51:03,998
I thought you were
a lot smarter than that.

1378
01:51:04,670 --> 01:51:08,265
Someone has betrayed you.

1379
01:51:08,441 --> 01:51:10,875
He works for the head
of Jordanian Intelligence...

1380
01:51:11,043 --> 01:51:12,806
...which means he works for us...

1381
01:51:12,979 --> 01:51:19,009
...which means...
Which means you work for us.

1382
01:51:21,154 --> 01:51:24,282
I work for you.

1383
01:51:35,401 --> 01:51:36,459
Are you comfortable?

1384
01:51:37,170 --> 01:51:39,035
Can I make you...

1385
01:51:39,205 --> 01:51:41,605
...more comfortable?

1386
01:51:47,747 --> 01:51:50,545
I'm not lying to you, Kareem.
I'm not lying to you.

1387
01:51:51,584 --> 01:51:55,213
We know... We know where you are!

1388
01:51:56,489 --> 01:51:58,514
Where am I?

1389
01:51:58,691 --> 01:52:01,660
You... You... You are in the light.

1390
01:52:01,828 --> 01:52:04,729
The light is on you. Look at it.

1391
01:52:05,798 --> 01:52:07,629
No, no, no.

1392
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:11,497
The light...
The light is on you, motherfucker.

1393
01:52:16,809 --> 01:52:19,300
What do you think is happening here,
Mr. Ferris?

1394
01:52:19,478 --> 01:52:21,946
Do you think the cavalry
is coming for you?

1395
01:52:23,082 --> 01:52:24,845
Let's wait.

1396
01:52:26,953 --> 01:52:29,547
Nobody's coming for you.

1397
01:52:29,722 --> 01:52:31,815
Welcome to Guantanamo.

1398
01:52:34,794 --> 01:52:37,024
God! Fuck!

1399
01:53:19,772 --> 01:53:21,467
MAN

1400
01:53:42,828 --> 01:53:43,886
MAN:

1401
01:54:26,172 --> 01:54:27,264
MEN:

1402
01:55:06,612 --> 01:55:07,636
MARWAN:

1403
01:55:30,903 --> 01:55:32,894
You can tell who cares
about you the most...

1404
01:55:33,072 --> 01:55:35,973
...by who comes first
to visit you in the hospital.

1405
01:55:36,142 --> 01:55:38,702
And I believe I am the first.

1406
01:55:38,878 --> 01:55:41,540
That is not difficult,
because nobody knows where you are.

1407
01:55:41,714 --> 01:55:43,272
Yeah.

1408
01:55:43,449 --> 01:55:45,440
And where am I, Hani?

1409
01:55:45,618 --> 01:55:47,677
You're home, in Amman.

1410
01:55:50,189 --> 01:55:55,024
So it was your man I spoke to
on the phone...

1411
01:55:55,928 --> 01:55:58,954
...your men who took Aisha...

1412
01:55:59,131 --> 01:56:01,827
...your men who dropped me off
in the desert.

1413
01:56:02,001 --> 01:56:05,027
I was of some assistance, I admit.

1414
01:56:05,204 --> 01:56:08,970
But it was not me
that picked you up in the desert.

1415
01:56:09,141 --> 01:56:10,665
Edward could not find you.

1416
01:56:11,243 --> 01:56:14,838
Not with all his aircraft, all his people,
all his money...

1417
01:56:15,014 --> 01:56:17,642
...and joie de vivre.

1418
01:56:17,817 --> 01:56:20,047
So how, I wonder, did I do it?

1419
01:56:20,219 --> 01:56:23,677
- Karami.
- Very good. You remember him?

1420
01:56:23,856 --> 01:56:28,418
Yes, I remember him, Hani.
He was in the fucking room with me.

1421
01:56:28,594 --> 01:56:32,394
He was in the room
because I put him there.

1422
01:56:32,565 --> 01:56:34,999
I'm just sorry
I wasn't there a few minutes sooner.

1423
01:56:35,167 --> 01:56:38,659
Right. What would've happened
if you were a few minutes later, Hani?

1424
01:56:38,838 --> 01:56:41,534
- Then I shudder to think.
- No, I shudder to think.

1425
01:56:43,476 --> 01:56:46,877
How badly did you hurt Aisha
when you took her, huh?

1426
01:56:47,046 --> 01:56:49,571
- That's what I wanna know.
- Aisha, not at all.

1427
01:56:50,749 --> 01:56:53,343
The room we messed up
after we took her.

1428
01:56:53,519 --> 01:56:55,248
Bullshit, Hani, bullshit!

1429
01:56:55,421 --> 01:56:58,390
All right. We tested that blood! All right?
It was hers!

1430
01:56:58,557 --> 01:57:01,185
She is a nurse.
She gives blood every month.

1431
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:03,885
Now, please, let go of the jacket.
Thank you.

1432
01:57:06,031 --> 01:57:09,398
You're trying to tell me
you didn't tell her, Hani?

1433
01:57:09,568 --> 01:57:12,799
I told her what I could,
which I admit was not very much...

1434
01:57:12,972 --> 01:57:15,372
...because these are matters
of state security.

1435
01:57:15,541 --> 01:57:17,805
So she doesn't know anything
about what happened?

1436
01:57:17,977 --> 01:57:20,969
She knows what everybody
who knows me knows.

1437
01:57:21,147 --> 01:57:25,174
That I am an exceedingly polite gentleman
and a very good conversationalist.

1438
01:57:25,351 --> 01:57:26,818
Huh.

1439
01:57:27,620 --> 01:57:30,589
If I may be so fucking impolite, Hani...

1440
01:57:30,756 --> 01:57:33,384
...I almost died in that goddamn room.

1441
01:57:33,559 --> 01:57:37,188
And if you had died,
I would have told her what you did for her.

1442
01:57:37,363 --> 01:57:41,561
And she...
She would have loved you forever.

1443
01:57:42,234 --> 01:57:45,601
Whereas now you are going
to have to earn that right.

1444
01:57:46,272 --> 01:57:48,763
That's great news.

1445
01:57:51,243 --> 01:57:53,268
Fantastic work, Hani.

1446
01:57:53,445 --> 01:57:55,470
Really. Excellent.

1447
01:57:56,482 --> 01:57:58,643
So you now have Al-Saleem, right?

1448
01:57:59,485 --> 01:58:01,350
That was the plan, my dear.

1449
01:58:03,155 --> 01:58:06,852
And I presume he's not giving you
any information.

1450
01:58:07,026 --> 01:58:08,584
Not yet.

1451
01:58:20,573 --> 01:58:22,700
Your work's done here, buddy.

1452
01:58:23,142 --> 01:58:25,542
You're gonna come back.
I got you a corner office...

1453
01:58:25,711 --> 01:58:27,838
...just down the hall from mine.

1454
01:58:28,013 --> 01:58:31,278
As soon as I get the guy who's in it
out of it, it's all yours.

1455
01:58:31,450 --> 01:58:33,680
More money, a fancy title.

1456
01:58:33,852 --> 01:58:37,652
No sunscreen, no couscous,
unless you really want it.

1457
01:58:37,823 --> 01:58:41,554
- Right down the hall from you, huh, Ed?
- Right down the hall from me.

1458
01:58:41,727 --> 01:58:45,823
Well, I think we both know you'd be
more comfortable without me there.

1459
01:58:46,565 --> 01:58:49,500
Now, don't think about it too long,
because I'll take that as a slight.

1460
01:58:49,668 --> 01:58:51,067
Hm.

1461
01:58:51,237 --> 01:58:55,799
Besides, what else are you gonna do?
Stay here?

1462
01:58:55,975 --> 01:58:59,001
Maybe for a little while, huh?
I mean, why wouldn't I?

1463
01:58:59,178 --> 01:59:01,203
Why would you?

1464
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:03,539
What if I like the Middle East?

1465
01:59:05,084 --> 01:59:08,884
Ain't nobody likes the Middle East, buddy.
There's nothing here to like.

1466
01:59:09,355 --> 01:59:10,913
Hmm.

1467
01:59:11,323 --> 01:59:14,417
Well, maybe that's the problem right there,
isn't it, Ed?

1468
01:59:15,928 --> 01:59:17,293
Hm.

1469
01:59:17,630 --> 01:59:19,655
Oh, buddy, buddy, buddy.

1470
01:59:19,832 --> 01:59:23,996
You know, you're the best I got.

1471
01:59:24,169 --> 01:59:25,898
And you know it hurts me to say that.

1472
01:59:28,907 --> 01:59:31,967
Good luck on winning this war, Ed.

1473
01:59:32,144 --> 01:59:35,875
I hope everyone thinks
you did it all by yourself, huh?

1474
01:59:41,186 --> 01:59:43,086
You're not safe here.

1475
01:59:43,255 --> 01:59:45,018
I'm not safe anywhere.

1476
01:59:45,190 --> 01:59:47,283
You walk out on me,
you know what that means.

1477
01:59:47,459 --> 01:59:49,359
What does that mean?

1478
01:59:50,429 --> 01:59:52,363
That means you're giving up
on America.

1479
01:59:53,032 --> 01:59:56,627
Just be careful calling yourself
America, huh, Ed?

1480
01:59:57,503 --> 02:00:02,167
Listen, you have a safe flight home.
Say hey to the wife and kids.

1481
02:00:02,341 --> 02:00:04,741
Nobody's innocent in this shit, Ferris.

1482
02:01:24,723 --> 02:01:25,747
<i>What's he doing?</i>

1483
02:01:25,924 --> 02:01:27,653
<i>Nothing. Buying vegetables.</i>

1484
02:01:28,794 --> 02:01:31,695
<i>What about us, sir?
What do you want us to do?</i>

1485
02:01:31,864 --> 02:01:33,456
<i>Are we staying with him?</i>

1486
02:01:33,632 --> 02:01:36,499
No. Buddy's done.

1487
02:01:36,668 --> 02:01:38,226
He's all by himself.

1488
02:01:38,404 --> 02:01:41,771
<i>Copy that. Cleared off target.</i>
