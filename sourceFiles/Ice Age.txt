00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,390
Why not call it the Big Chill? Or the Nippy era?

3
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,390
I'm just saying how do we know it's an ice age?

4
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,310
Because of all the ice!

5
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,020
Well, things just got a little chillier.

6
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,650
Help! Help!

7
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,150
Come on, kids, let's go.
The traffic's moving.

8
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,780
But, but, but dad.

9
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,330
No "buts". You can play "extinction" later.

10
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,200
Okay. Come on, guys.

11
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,500
So, where's Eddie?

12
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,500
He said something about being on a
verge of an evolutionary breakthrough.

13
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,920
Really?

14
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,760
I'm flying!

15
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,590
Some breakthrough.

16
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,140
Look out!
You're going the wrong way. Crazy mammoth.

17
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,320
Hey, do the world a favour!

18
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,400
Move your issues off the road!

19
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,910
If my trunk was that small,
I wouldn't draw attention to myself, pal.

20
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,330
Give me a break.

21
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,950
We've been waddlin' all day.

22
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,380
Oh, go ahead. Follow the crowd.

23
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,210
It'll be quieter when you're gone.

24
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,050
Come on. If he wants to freeze to death, let him.

25
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,930
Hey, hey. I'm up, I'm up!

26
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,690
Hey, rise and shine, everybody.

27
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,730
Huh? Zak? Marshall?

28
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,110
Bertie? Uncle Fungus?

29
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,780
Where is everybody?

30
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,120
Come on, guys.
We gonna miss the mi.. the mi.. the...

31
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,740
...migration.

32
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,960
They left without me.

33
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,960
They do this every year!

34
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,630
Why? Doesn't anyone love me?

35
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,390
Isn't there anyone who cares about Sid the Sloth?

36
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,810
All right, I'll just go by myself.

37
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,850
Oh! Sick!

38
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,940
Hey, wide body! Kerb it next time!

39
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,400
Oh! Jeez... Oh..Yuck! Oh..

40
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,740
I can't believe it. Fresh wild greens.

41
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,660
Frank, where did you ever...

42
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,070
Go ahead, dig in.

43
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,490
A dandelion.
I thought the frost wiped them all out.

44
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,200
All but one.

45
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,000
Makes me so... I wanna..

46
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,750
Oh! Yuck!

47
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,090
This has definitely not been my day.
I mean... You know what I'm saying, buddy?

48
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,840
Oh, what a mess.

49
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,640
Hey, you rhinos, you know, you have really
tiny brains, did you know that?

50
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,680
No. It's just a fact.

51
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,890
No offence!

52
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,890
But you barely know what I'm talking about.

53
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,600
Oh, Yummo.

54
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,350
A dandelion.

55
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,400
Must be the last one of the season.

56
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,490
Carl.
Easy, Frank.

57
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,320
He ruined our salad.

58
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,740
Oh, my mistake.
That was my mistake. Let me...

59
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,910
No, seriously, let me take care of this.

60
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh. What is this?

61
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,870
Pine cones!!!

62
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,960
Oh my goodness, they're my favourite.

63
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,250
Hmm, delicious.

64
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,000
Ow.

65
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,460
That's a... good eating.

66
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,840
Don't let me hog them all up.
No, here, you have some.

67
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,010
Tasty, isn't it?

68
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,680
Bon app?©tit.

69
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,900
Now?

70
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,350
Now.

71
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,480
Hey!

72
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,900
Just pretend that I am not here.

73
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,610
I wanna hit him at full speed.

74
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,280
That's okay, Frank.
We'll have some fun with him.

75
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,910
Don't let them impale me, please.
I wanna live!

76
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,950
Get off me!

77
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,460
Come on, you're making a scene.

78
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,460
We'll just take our furry pinata and go.
Would you mind?

79
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,590
Hey. Buddy, if it's not them today,
it's just someone else tomorrow.

80
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,260
I like rather not be today. Okay?

81
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,640
Look. We're gonnaa break your neck so you
don't feel a thing. How's that?

82
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,680
Wait a minute.
I thought rhinos were vegetarians.

83
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,850
An excelent point.
Shut up!

84
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,690
Who says we gonna eat him
after we kill him?

85
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,560
Yeh, come on, move it.

86
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,690
You know, I don't like
animals that kill for pleasure.

87
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,190
Save it for a mammal that cares.

88
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,230
I'm a mammal that cares.

89
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,190
Okay, look. If either of you make it

90
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,490
across that sink hole in front of you, you get the Sloth.

91
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,780
That's right, you losers.
You take one step and you're dead.

92
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,290
You were bluffing, huh?
Yeah, that was a bluff.

93
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:40,960
Get him!

94
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,210
A dandelion?

95
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,250
We did it!

96
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,550
What?

97
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,310
You have beautiful eyes.

98
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,270
Get off my face.

99
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,310
Wow, you and me, we make a great team.

100
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,820
I mean. What'd you say we just head South together?

101
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,320
Great!
Yeah, hey jump up on my back and relax your whole way.

102
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,280
Wow. Really?
No.

103
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,280
Wait, aren't you going to South?

104
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,700
The changing seasons, migration instincts?

105
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,580
Any of this a-ringin' a bell?
I guess not, bye.

106
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,540
Okay, then thanks for the help.
I can take it from here.

107
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:02,540
Hey, you over-grown weasel.
Wait till we get down there.

108
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,950
Ohohou. That south thing is way overrated.
The heat, the crowd. Who needs any?

109
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:11,630
Isn't this great? You and me, two bachelors
knockin' about in the wild.

110
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,560
No, you just want a bodyguard
so you don't become somebody's side dish.

111
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,100
You're very shrewd mammal.

112
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,150
Can you lead the way, Mr. Big Guy?
Didn't get the name.

113
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,020
Manfred.
Manfred? Yuck.

114
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,530
How about Manny the Moody Mammoth?
Or Manny the Melancholy... Manny the...

115
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,780
Stop following me.

116
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,000
OK, so you've got issues.
Look, you won't even know I'm here.

117
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,960
I'll just zip the lip when I say...

118
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:29,250
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.

119
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,010
Isn't it nice if he'll be joining us for breakfast?

120
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,430
It wouldn't be breakfast without him.

121
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,390
Especially since his daddy wiped out half
our pack and wears our skin to keep warm.

122
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,560
An eye for an eye. Don't you think?

123
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,230
Let's show that human what happens
when he messes with Sabers.

124
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,400
Alert the troops. We attack at dawn.

125
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:58,240
And Diego, bring me that baby. Alive.

126
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:03,500
If I'm gonna enjoy my revenge, I want it to be fresh.

127
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,150
Phew. I'm wiped out.

128
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,610
That's your shelter?

129
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,030
Hey. You're a big guy. You got a lot of wood.
I'm a little guy.

130
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,440
You've got half a stick.

131
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:38,200
Yeah, but with my little stick, and my highly evolved brain...

132
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
I shall create fire.

133
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,040
Fascinating.

134
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,370
We'll see if brains triumph over brawn tonight.
Now, won't we?

135
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,760
Hey, I think I saw spark.

136
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,680
Any chance I can squeeze in there with you Manny?
Old pal?

137
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,230
Isn't there someone else you can annoy?

138
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:09,360
Friends? Family? Poisonous reptiles?

139
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,530
My family abandoned me. They just kinda migrated without me.

140
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,990
You should see what they did last year.

141
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,700
You know, I mean. They woke up early and
finely tied my hands and feet.

142
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:26,540
and they gagged me with a fieldmouse, barricaded the cave door,
and covered their tracks, went through water so l'd lose their scent,

143
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,250
and... who needs 'em, anyway?

144
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,840
So what about you? You've family?

145
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,260
Okay, you're tired, I see.
Well, we'll talk more in the morning.

146
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,640
Ow, ow, a, a, ow, ow.

147
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,480
Manfred? Manfred.

148
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,100
Could you scooch over a drop?

149
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,940
Come on, nobody falls asleep that fast.

150
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,900
Manny!

151
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,620
There's Diego, fall back!

152
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,580
Where's the baby?

153
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,750
I've lost it over the falls.
You lost it?

154
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,180
I want that baby, Diego.
I'll get it.

155
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,300
You'd better. Unless you want to serve
yourself as the replacement.

156
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,720
We'll go up to Half peak. Meet us there.

157
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,640
It'd better be alive.

158
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,810
Can we trust you with that, Diego?

159
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,020
Let's go!

160
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,590
and then she picked this hair off my shoulder and says, look...

161
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,300
If you're gonna have an extra mating dance,

162
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,930
at least pick a female with the same color pelt, right?

163
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,310
And I thought, wow, she's gonna go praying mantis on me.
I mean, you know what I'm saying?

164
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,020
If you find a mate in life, you should be loyal.

165
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,360
In your case, grateful.
Get away from me.

166
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,360
Well, I think mating for life is stupid.
I mean there's plenty of Sid to go around.

167
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,070
Manny?

168
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,300
Look at that.
He's okay.

169
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:21,520
She's gone.

170
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,450
Hey, hey, hey Manny, are you forgetting something?

171
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,030
No.
But you just saved him.

172
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,160
Yeah, but I'm still trying to get rid of the last thing I saved.

173
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,160
You can't leave him here.

174
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,210
Look, there's smoke.

175
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,380
That's his herd right up the hill. We should return him.

176
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,300
Let's get something straight here. Okay?
There's no "we".

177
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,300
There never was a "we".

178
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,850
In fact, without me, there wouldn't even be a "you"!

179
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,350
Just up the hill.

180
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,020
Listen very carefully. I'm not g-o-i-n-g.

181
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,690
Fine. Be a jerk.

182
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,240
I'll take care of him.

183
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,860
Go. Yeah, that's good.

184
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,610
You'll take care...
You can't even take care of yourself.

185
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,700
This I gotta see.

186
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,870
I'll return you. We don't need that meany-weeny mammoth, do we?

187
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,500
No, we don't.

188
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,740
You're the embarrassment to nature, do you know that?

189
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,820
That is cake.

190
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,910
I'm fine. I'm fine!

191
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,450
I'm gonna die.

192
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,190
That pink thing is mine.

193
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,610
No, actually that pink thing belongs to us.

194
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,240
Us? You two are a bit of an odd couple.

195
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,990
There is no "us".
I see.

196
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,290
Can't have one of your own, so you want to adopt.

197
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,670
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt this snack.

198
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,880
But we gotta go.

199
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,790
The baby, please.

200
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,300
I was returning him to his herd.

201
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,710
Oh, yeah. Nice try, bucktooth.

202
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,800
You're calling me a liar?
I didn't say that.

203
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,510
You were thinking it.

204
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,430
I don't like this cat. He reads minds.

205
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,770
Name is Diego, friend.

206
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,640
Manfred. And I'm not your friend.

207
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,770
Fine, Manfred.

208
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,650
If you're looking for the humans, you're wasting your time.

209
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,070
They left this morning.

210
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,110
Thanks for the advice. Now beat it.

211
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,360
All right, I'll help you bring it to its herd.

212
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,490
But promise me that you leave me alone after that.

213
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,200
Okay, okay, deal.

214
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,990
What's your problem?
You're my problem.

215
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,450
But I think you're stressed.
That's why you eat so much.

216
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,580
I mean. It's hard to get fat on a vegan diet.

217
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:33,790
I'm not fat. It's all that fur.
It makes me look pooffy.

218
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,460
All right, you have fat hair.
But when you're ready to talk, I'm here.

219
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,890
I don't know. Just drop it on the ledge.

220
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,970
Shouldn't we make sure they found him?
Good idea.

221
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,640
No, no, no!
Wait. Wait.

222
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,440
Don't spear me!

223
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,320
Ohhhm. This is a problem.

224
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,860
Now what?

225
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,740
Oh. That's perfect.

226
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,650
I told you they were gone.

227
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:34,860
Look who it is.

228
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,610
Don't you have some poor defenseless animals to disembowel?

229
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,030
They couldn't be far. I mean. They went this way?

230
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,780
Or this way?

231
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,030
You don't know much about tracking, do you?

232
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:47,910
Hey, I'm a Sloth. I see a tree, eat a leaf, that's my tracking.

233
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,160
You didn't miss them by much.

234
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,910
It's still green.

235
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,960
They headed north 2 hours ago.

236
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,170
It's still green. They headed north 2 hours ago.

237
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,880
You don't need this aggravation.

238
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,680
Give me the baby.

239
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,140
I can track humans a lot faster than you can.

240
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,890
And you're just a good citizen helping out, right?

241
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,980
I just know where the humans are going.

242
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,600
Glacier-pass.

243
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,980
Everybody knows they have a settlement on the other side.

244
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,070
Well, unless you know how to track,

245
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:24,200
you've never gonna reach them before the pass closes up with snow.

246
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,070
Which should be like, tomorrow.

247
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,500
So you can give that baby to me or go get lost in the blizzard.

248
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,080
It's your choice.

249
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,800
Here's your little bundle of joy.
We'll return it to the humans.

250
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:49,810
Oooh. The Big Bad Tigey Wigey get left behind.
Poor Tigey Wigey...

251
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,560
Sid, Tigey Wigey is gonna lead the way.

252
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,980
Manny, can I talk to you for a second?

253
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,770
No.

254
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,990
The sooner we find the humans,
the sooner I get rid of Mr. Stinky-drool-face.

255
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,570
And the baby too.

256
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,330
You won't always have jumbo around to protect you.

257
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:13,870
And when that day comes, I suggest you watch your back.

258
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,870
Cause I'll be chewing on it.

259
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,710
Hey, uber-tracker, up front where I can see you.

260
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,380
Help me.

261
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,980
You gotta make it stop. I can't take it anymore!

262
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,900
I've eaten things that didn't complain this much.

263
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,190
He won't stop squirming.
You're holding it wrong.

264
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:50,320
Watch its head! Just put it down!
Jeez, 'pick him up, put him down, make him...'

265
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,830
Its nose's dry.

266
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,740
That means something is wrong with it.

267
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,870
Someone should lick it. Just in case.

268
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,620
I'll do it.

269
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,870
Hey, he's wearing one of those baby thingies.

270
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,750
So?
So if it poops, where does it go?

271
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,130
Humans are disgusting.

272
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,220
Okay, you.

273
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,430
Check for poop.

274
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,970
Hey. Why am I the poop checker?

275
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,970
Because returning him home was your idea.
Because you're small and insignificant.

276
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,520
And because I'll pummel you if you don't.

277
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,060
Why else?
Now, Sid!

278
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:24,280
Yuhh. Yuck. Yuhh.

279
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,110
I mean, my goodness.

280
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,780
All right, look out, look out. Coming through.

281
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,110
Watch out!
Stop waving that thing around!

282
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,160
Oh, I'm gonna slip!

283
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,370
It's clean! Got you!

284
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,090
Will you cut it out!

285
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,340
Hey, do that again.
He likes it.

286
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,390
It's makin' me feel better too.

287
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,990
Here, you hold it.

288
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,220
Here. Turn him towards me.

289
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,360
Where is the baby?
There he is!

290
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,070
Where is the baby?

291
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,330
There he is!

292
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,620
Stop it! You're scaring him!

293
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,750
I bet he's hungry.

294
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,670
How about some milk?

295
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,630
Uhh. I'd love some.
Not you, the baby.

296
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,510
Well I ain't exactly lactating right now, pal.

297
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,890
You're a little low on the food chain to... aren't you?

298
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,100
Enough!

299
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,440
Food!

300
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,490
I don't know, but I've been told...

301
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:56,780
I don't know, but I've been told...
End of the world be mighty cold...

302
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,750
Prepare for the ice age!

303
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:04,210
Protect the Dodo way of life!

304
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:07,290
Survivals separate the Dodos from the beasts.

305
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,760
Ice age?

306
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,890
I've heard of these crackpots.

307
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:21,810
Intruders!

308
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:25,150
Don't fall in. If you do, you'll definitely...

309
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,020
Intruders!

310
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,150
Intru... Uaaaa.

311
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:28,900
Uuuuuuuh.

312
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,690
Burn and die.

313
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,900
Hey, can we have our melon back?

314
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,280
Junior is hungry and...

315
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:38,740
No way! This is our private stockpile for the ice age.

316
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:43,000
Subarctic temperatures will force us
underground for a billion years.

317
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,620
So you've got three melons?

318
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:52,050
If you weren't smart enough to plan ahead, then doom on you.

319
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,550
Doom on you! Doom on you!

320
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,090
Get away from me!

321
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,640
Oh! No!

322
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,520
Retrieve the melon!

323
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,350
Taikwondoodos!

324
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,680
Taikwondoodos! Attack!

325
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,660
The melon!

326
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,830
There goes our last female.

327
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:38,300
Got it, got it, got it. Don't got it.
The Last Melon!

328
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,560
Aghhh. Sid!

329
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,810
Now we gotta find more food.

330
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,480
Right, more to the right. Right, right, right.

331
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:16,280
Hey, look at that. Dinner and a show.

332
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,240
Left! Left, left... left! Leeft! Aaaa...Ugh!  Uaaaaau!

333
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:28,370
Now to find a meal befitting a conquering hero.

334
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,670
What ho? A foe?

335
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,170
Come on, come on. You want a piece of me?

336
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,590
Spoils!

337
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,510
worthy of such a noble...

338
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,010
Uuuh!

339
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,180
Bedtime, squirt.

340
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,160
Oh. The triumphant return!

341
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,580
Hh? Oh that.. hhh.

342
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,160
I'm so full.

343
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,000
How about a good night kiss for your big buddy, Sid??

344
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,000
Shh. He's asleep.

345
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,960
I was talking to you.

346
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,920
Fine, I'll tuck myself in.

347
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,220
All right, gooood niiight.

348
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,870
Will you stop it!

349
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,370
All right. All right.

350
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,710
I was trying to relax.

351
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:52,890
What the... Go ahead. Slice me.

352
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,510
It'll be the last thing you ever do.

353
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,540
I'm working here, you waste of fur.

354
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,190
Frustrated Diego.

355
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,270
Tracking down helpless infants too difficult for you?

356
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,320
What are you two doing here?

357
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
Soto's getting tired of waiting.

358
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,820
Yeah. Yeah. He said, come back with the baby,

359
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:10,820
or don't come back at all!

360
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,700
Well, I have a message for Soto.

361
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:17,500
Tell him, I'm bringing the baby.

362
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:23,170
And tell him, I'm bringing a mammoth.

363
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,380
A mammoth.

364
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,510
Mammoths never travel alone.

365
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:30,840
Well, this one does.
And I'm leading him to Half peak.

366
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,600
Look at all that meat.

367
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,600
Let's get him! Not yet!

368
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,440
We need the whole pack to bring this mammoth down.

369
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,060
Get everyone ready.

370
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,520
Now!

371
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,260
Where is the baby?

372
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,130
You lost it?

373
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,850
Sid!

374
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:17,390
It's so ugly.
Positively adorable.

375
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:21,310
Hello, pumpkin. Hello, little baldy bean.

376
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,650
Where did you find it?

377
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:25,270
Ah. The poor kid all alone in the wild.

378
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,360
Sabers were closing in on him.
So I just snatched him.

379
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,740
Oh. So brave.

380
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:34,910
Yeh. Well, he needed me and
I only wish I have one of my own.

381
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,990
Really?

382
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:40,080
I find that attractive in a male.

383
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:43,210
Who wouldn't want a family, I always say.

384
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,630
Wher you've been hiding?

385
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,670
Yeh. Well, you know.

386
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,640
Cute kid, huh?

387
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,800
So, so what I was saying, ladies...

388
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,680
Hey! Hi! Manny!

389
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,810
What's the matter with you?

390
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,360
Excuse me, ladies.

391
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,980
You just keep marinating and I'll be right back.

392
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,700
Sssss. Sexy.

393
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,910
He's not much to look at
but it's so hard to find a family guy.

394
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,160
Tell me about it.
All the sensitive ones get eaten.

395
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:23,490
No, no, no. Manny, please,
I'm begging you. I need him.

396
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,790
Why? A good looking guy like you?

397
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,290
No. You say that, but you don't mean it.

398
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,050
No, seriously, look at you.

399
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:31,670
Those ladies, they don't stand a chance.

400
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,630
We have a very cruel sense of humour.

401
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,140
Hey. Don't let me cramp your style.

402
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,970
Oh. Thanks, Manny. You're pal.

403
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,140
You are the best.
Without Pinky.
Manny, Manny, I need him.

404
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:47,400
So, ladies, where were we?

405
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,780
Carl?
Easy, Frank.

406
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,370
Pretty tail walks by, suddenly he moves like a cheetah.

407
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,570
And that tiger.

408
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:01,160
Yeah, Mr. Great Tracker.
Can't even find a sloth.

409
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,370
What am I? The wet nurse?

410
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,370
What are you lookin' at, bone bag?

411
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,510
Look at you. You gonna grow in a great predator, huh?

412
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,970
I don't think so.

413
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,510
What do you got? You got a little...

414
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,350
patch of fur, no fang, no claws.

415
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,770
You're folds of skin wrapped in mush.
What's so threatening about you?

416
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,900
Hey, does this look like a petting zoo to you? Huh?

417
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,210
Okay. All right, wise guy.

418
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,960
You just earned a time-out.

419
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:45,380
Oh you think that's funny? How about this?

420
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,300
You'll be a little snack for the owls.

421
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:55,100
You're a brave little squirt, l'll give you that.

422
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,730
Thank goodness. Thank goodness.

423
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:09,280
Oh. No, a tiger!
Help! Help!

424
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,610
Where's the baby?

425
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:14,690
Oo he's fine. Manfred has him.
Just put me in your mouth. Come on. Hurry up.

426
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,080
He got me!
Help...

427
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,370
Get away from me.

428
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,000
It went this way.
Over here.

429
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,100
No, Carl!
The tiger beat us to him.

430
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,310
Wait a minute.

431
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,360
He's dead, all right.

432
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,570
No. Carnivores have all the fun.

433
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,700
Gosh, I hate breaking their hearts like that.
But you know how it is.

434
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:57,490
All right, thanks.
You can put me down now.

435
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,250
Manny! Manny!

436
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,380
Guys, l thought we were in a hurry.

437
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,630
And Diego spit that out.
You don't know where it's been.

438
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:12,840
Boy. For a second there, I actually thought you gonna eat me.

439
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,340
I don't eat junk food.

440
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,050
Ha, ha, there you gotta...

441
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:21,600
I thought you're gonna... Were you?

442
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,310
Come on. Wait up. Wait up!
Wait... come on, come on. Can you wait a second please?

443
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,440
Hey, fellows!

444
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,110
Huh. Thanks for waiting.

445
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:35,490
3, 2, 1.

446
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,370
Sure is faithful.

447
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,220
Don't make me reach back there.
That was he. He started it.

448
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,850
I don't care who started it.
I'll finish it.

449
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:35,340
Modern architecture. It'll never last.

450
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,740
Hi, Manny.

451
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,910
Hi, Diego.

452
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,880
Hey, Sid.

453
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,130
You're lost, aren't you?
No, I know exactly where we are.

454
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,510
Ask him direction.

455
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,140
I don't need directions.
Fine, I'll ask him.

456
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:17,350
Hey, buddy. Have you seen any humans go by here?

457
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,440
U u u. I love this game!
I love this game! Okay, okay.

458
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,820
Three words.

459
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,690
First word..... a stomp.

460
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,400
Stomp. No, no. Stamp, stamp.

461
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,450
Let me try.

462
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,740
Hmm..... Pack.
Good word, Manny.

463
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,660
Pack of long teeth...

464
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,790
and claws?

465
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,960
Pack of wolves? Pack of...

466
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,710
Pack of bears?  Pack of fleas.

467
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,710
Pack of whiskers? Pack of noses?

468
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,380
Ehmmm. Pachyderm?

469
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,300
Pack of lies. Pack of troubles. Pack a wallop.

470
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,090
Pack of.. Aooooou!..  birds.
Pa.. pack of flying fish!

471
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:41,850
Hey! Great news.

472
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,600
I found a short cut!

473
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:47,480
What do you mean short cut?

474
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,900
I mean faster that the long way around.

475
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:52,700
Au! I know what a short cut is...

476
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,120
Look, either we slip through there and
and beat the humans at the Glacier Pass.

477
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,200
Or take the long way and miss them.

478
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:00,000
Through there!

479
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,580
What do you take me for?

480
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:05,420
This time tomorrow you could be a free mammoth.

481
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:08,460
Or a nanny. personally I never get tired of peekaboo.

482
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:10,590
Hey guys. Hey guys check this out.

483
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,840
Sid, the tiger found a short cut.

484
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,180
No thanks, I choose life.

485
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,350
Then I suggest you take the short cut!

486
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,980
Are you threatening me?

487
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,650
Move sloth!

488
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,360
Way to go, tiger.

489
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,610
Quick. Get inside.

490
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,020
OK, I vote short cut.

491
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:21,080
Come on guys. Stick together it's easy to get lost in here.

492
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,390
Eh, guys!

493
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,320
Eh, eh... Fish.

494
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:43,870
Will you keep up, please?
Hard enough to keep track of one baby.

495
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,000
I got you!

496
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,440
Captain! Iceberg ahead!

497
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:57,940
Oh no.

498
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:53,060
Wow! Huh! Yeah! Who's up for round two!

499
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,360
Tell the kid to be more careful.

500
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:42,630
Look, look. Tigers.

501
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,970
No. It's ok. It's ok.

502
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:50,300
Look the tigers are just playing tag with the antilope.

503
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:53,520
With their teeth.

504
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,810
Come on Sid, lets play tag - you're it.

505
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:00,940
Sure.

506
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,230
Ok, ok. Where are the sloth?

507
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,360
You know. You never see any sloth in these things.
Have you ever noticed?

508
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:08,030
Oh look Manny! A mammoth.

509
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,160
Uuh. Somebody pinch me.

510
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,780
Hey, hey this fat one.

511
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:13,240
Looks just like you.

512
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:15,750
Oh, he's got a family.

513
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,370
Oh, he's happy.

514
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,920
Look he is playing with his kid.

515
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,000
See Manny that's your problem.

516
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:23,750
That's what mammoths supposed to do.

517
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,010
Sid.
Find a she-mmoth, have the little baby mammoth...

518
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,680
Sid!
What?

519
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,090
Shut up!

520
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,550
Well. Would you look at that.

521
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,310
The tiger actually did it. There's Half-peak.

522
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,850
Next stop. Glacier pass.

523
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,900
How could I ever have doubted you?

524
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:11,110
Did you hear that little fella?

525
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:12,900
You are almost home?

526
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,690
My feet are sweating.

527
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:21,610
Do we have to get a news flash
every time your body does something?

528
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,280
Don't pay attention. Just ignore him

529
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,610
Seriously, my feet are really hot...

530
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:35,160
Tell me that was your stomach.

531
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,920
I am sure it was just thunder.

532
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,380
From under.., ground?

533
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,900
Come on keep up with me.

534
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,860
I would if you were moving.

535
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,660
Wow. I wish I could jump like that.

536
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,870
Wish granted.

537
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,960
Come on move faster.

538
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,710
Have you noticed the river of lava?

539
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,230
Hold Pinky!

540
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,220
Manny!!!

541
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,570
Manny, Manny, Manny are you ok?

542
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:30,610
Come on, come on  say something.
Anything!

543
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:36,410
What. What? I can't hear you.

544
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,700
You are standing on my trunk.

545
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:41,000
Are you OK?

546
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,880
Why did you do that ?

547
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,340
You could have die trying to save me.

548
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:48,630
That's what you do in a herd...

549
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,970
We look out for each other.

550
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,800
Well... thanks.

551
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,020
I don't now how about you guys, but...

552
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,930
we're the weirdest herd I've ever seen.

553
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:21,710
I can't wait to get my claws in that mammoth.

554
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:26,170
No one touches the mammoth until I get that baby.

555
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:34,300
First, I'm gonna slice its hind quarters into sections.
I'm on to put the white meat in one pile and dark in ano...

556
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,390
Hey. Knock it off. I am starving.

557
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:40,560
Next, the shoulders. Occasionally tough, but extremely juicy.

558
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,100
I told you to knock it off!

559
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,940
Save your energy!

560
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,270
Mammoths don't go down easy.

561
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,730
There is only one way to do it.

562
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:51,320
First you have to force it into a corner.

563
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:54,660
Cut off his retreat.

564
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,910
And when you three have it trapped...

565
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,910
I'll go for the throat.

566
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:11,800
Guys. We gotta get this kid out of the wind.

567
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,220
How much further? 3 miles.

568
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:21,850
I'm beat. We'll get there in the morning.

569
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:26,140
What're you doing?

570
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:28,110
I'm putting sloth on the map.

571
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:34,490
Hey. Why don't you make it realistic and draw him lying down?

572
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:37,490
And make him rounder.

573
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:39,780
Perfect.

574
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:43,160
I forgot how to laugh.

575
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:51,550
I am a genius.

576
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:57,840
From now one you'll have to refer to me as...

577
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,470
Sid, Lord of the flame.

578
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:04,850
Hey, Lord of the flame, your tail's on fire.

579
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:13,360
Thank you.

580
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,700
From now one I'm gonna call you Diego.

581
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:19,620
Lord you've touched me and you are dead.

582
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:22,240
I am just kidding you little knuckle-head.

583
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:25,500
Hey lovebirds. Look at this.

584
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,960
I don't believe it.

585
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:50,810
Come here, you little biped.
Come here, you little wormy-worm.

586
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,730
Come to uncle Sid.

587
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,110
No no this way, this way.

588
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:02,780
No. no, no. Go to him. Go to him.

589
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:08,040
Ok...

590
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,080
Good job.

591
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,460
Keep practicing.

592
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:19,260
Look at that. Our little guy is growing up.

593
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:24,600
Come on. Sleep time, lumpy.

594
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:31,750
Look at that big pushover.

595
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:37,400
You know Diego, I've never had a friend
who'd risk his life for me.

596
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:42,570
Yeah, Manny's... is a good guy.

597
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:45,530
Yeah he is.

598
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:48,190
Well, good night

599
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,450
All right. Let's get you all cleaned up.

600
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:27,030
I mean what's your daddy gonna say when
we go back smudgy and stinky like this?

601
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,700
OK. Let me just clean that up.

602
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:30,790
That looks good and little bit here...

603
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:33,080
You clean up nice - little fellow.

604
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:36,210
I think he start to look like me.
Hey Diego, what do you say?

605
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,960
Maybe we shouldn't do this.

606
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:41,010
Why not?

607
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:43,300
Because if we save him, he'll grow up to be a hunter.

608
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:45,180
And who do you think he'll hunt?

609
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,390
Maybe because we save him he won't hunt us.
Ow!

610
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:52,480
Yeh, maybe he'll grow fur and a long
skinny neck and call you mamma!

611
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:54,560
What is your problem?

612
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:58,110
Nothing. Lets go, it's freezing my tail off.

613
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:19,800
Hey Diego, you've frozen back there?

614
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,430
Get down.
What?

615
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,510
Shhh!
Get down and follow me.

616
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:28,550
Hey, hey! What's going on?

617
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:33,270
At the bottom of Half-peak...
there is an ambush waiting for you.

618
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:35,850
What?
What do you mean ambush.

619
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:39,190
You set us up?

620
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:41,900
It was my job, I was supposed to get the baby but then...

621
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,650
You brought us home for dinner!!!

622
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:45,860
That's it, you're out of the herd.

623
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:46,700
I am sorry.

624
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:49,120
No you are not. Not yet.

625
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,660
Listen, I can help you.

626
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:51,910
Stay close Sid.

627
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:53,160
We can fight our way out.

628
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,040
You can't. Pack's too strong.

629
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,290
You have to trust me!

630
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:58,630
Trust you ? Why in the world would we trust you ?

631
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:01,920
Because I am your only chance.

632
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:16,310
Hello ladies!

633
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:19,810
Hey look who decided to show up.

634
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:22,820
Diego. I was beginning to worry about you.

635
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:24,650
No need to worry.

636
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:30,070
In about 2 minutes you'll be satisfying your taste...
for revenge.

637
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,280
Very nice!

638
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:33,410
I see the sloth!

639
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:35,500
And he's got the baby!

640
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:38,210
Don't give away your positions until we see the mammoth.

641
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:40,210
He's the one we have to surprise.

642
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,050
You wanna maul something. Don't you think?

643
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:45,800
I wanna maul.

644
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,430
Then what are you waiting for?

645
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:52,800
No, I said wait for the mammoth!

646
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:17,200
Yohou! Backscratcher. Ahaa!

647
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:18,460
Eat my powder!

648
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,940
Loop-de-loop. Slalom, slalom baby!

649
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:09,550
Sorry fellas, it got a little frostbite.

650
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:11,840
Get him!

651
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:18,100
Surprise!

652
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,770
Ok, follow me.

653
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:27,270
We'll pick up Sid and get outta here while we can.

654
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:32,280
Come on Diego, let's bring this mammoth down.

655
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,630
There he is.

656
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:51,050
That's right - where's the baby. Oh!

657
01:04:54,590 --> 01:05:01,270
Survival of the fittest. I don't think so. Yeah!

658
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:13,240
What are you doing?

659
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:16,570
Leave the mammoth alone!

660
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:22,750
Fine! I'll take you down first.

661
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:39,910
We did it!

662
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:55,960
We were some team, huh?

663
01:06:57,220 --> 01:07:00,340
Were? Come on. We're still a team.

664
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:03,260
I am sorry I set you up.

665
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:06,600
Ah. You know me. I'm too lazy to hold a grudge.

666
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:11,610
Hey. Knock it off, squirt.

667
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,110
You have to be strong.

668
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:18,280
You have to take care of Manfred and Sid.

669
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:20,990
Especially Sid.

670
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:28,710
Come on. You can lick this. You're a tiger.
Look I'll carry you. Come on, what do you say?

671
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:31,210
Come on Diego, come on.

672
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:34,130
Tell him he's going to be OK, Manny.

673
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,300
Listen. You have to leave me here.

674
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:43,510
If those humans get through the pass, you'll never catch them.

675
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:45,180
You didn't have to do that.

676
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:49,350
That's what you do in a herd.

677
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:08,720
Don't forget about us, ok?

678
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,680
We won't forget about you.

679
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:55,600
Good bye.

680
01:11:56,890 --> 01:11:59,600
Good bye. Good bye.

681
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:00,440
Sid.

682
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,690
Good bye.

683
01:12:08,110 --> 01:12:10,650
That's right. Where is the baby?

684
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:11,700
Come on Sid.

685
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:13,530
Let's head South.

686
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:37,760
Save your breath Sid. You know humans can't talk.

687
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:39,390
Diego?

688
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:40,810
You're Ok!

689
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:42,440
9 lives baby.

690
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,980
You're ok. You're ok.

691
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:48,610
I could kiss ya. m. m. m. m. m. m. m. m. m.

692
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:50,490
Yuck, yuck. Bleeh.

693
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:52,780
Welcome back partner. Want a lift?

694
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:55,700
No thanks. I've got to save whatever dignity I've got left.

695
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:59,450
You're hanging out with us now, buddy.
Dignity's got nothing to do with it.

696
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:00,700
But I'll take that lift.

697
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:02,210
Yeh. Climb aboard.
Pick me up, buddy.

698
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,460
Mush!
