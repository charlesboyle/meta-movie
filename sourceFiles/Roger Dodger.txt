{1286}{1357}What's happening right now|is important only in the context...
{1359}{1411}of our continuing evolution|as a species.
{1414}{1493}Roger, all I'm saying is that I wish my|sister would learn to read a subway map.
{1495}{1546}By saying that, you disregard|the primary importance...
{1549}{1608}of utility in human relationships.
{1611}{1687}Our ability--|Men's ability to read maps...
{1689}{1723}to navigate, makes us useful.
{1726}{1795}You should discourage your sister|from even looking at a map.
{1797}{1897}Are you saying that we women|have an inferior sense of direction?.
{1915}{1967}Which way is north,Joyce,|without looking around?.
{1970}{2003}What?.
{2006}{2051}You heard me. Point north.|Quick. North.
{2054}{2085}Quick. North.
{2087}{2123}North. North.
{2178}{2231}- You're right.|- Is he right?.
{2234}{2275}- He's right.|- Very impressive.
{2278}{2329}As she has throughout history...
{2331}{2416}the female responds to the male|who displays the most utility.
{2419}{2487}By honing those skills|which make me useful...
{2490}{2568}I stave off|my inevitable obsolescence.
{2571}{2635}You stay home honing your ability|to program a VCR?.
{2637}{2711}My VCR's been flashing 1 2:00|for three years.
{2743}{2789}What else, Roger?.
{2791}{2885}Oh, driving a standard shift.|Lifting heavy things.
{2887}{2937}- Air guitar.|- Yes, yes.
{2939}{2983}Go ahead and chuckle, okay?.
{2986}{3065}But until women evolve the ability|to move objects telepathically--
{3067}{3103}and they will--
{3105}{3156}physical strength|remains a primary utility.
{3159}{3203}Here's to brute strength then.
{3253}{3362}Roger, you're forgetting|a very important male utility.
{3364}{3395}What's that?. Barbecuing?.
{3471}{3495}Sex.
{3498}{3603}Yeah. I want a guy to do more|than just program my VCR.
{3605}{3699}Oh, I'll program your VCR, baby,|like you never had it.
{3702}{3756}It's a top-loader.|You thinkyou can handle that?.
{3759}{3818}Interestingly, a group of scientists|in England...
{3821}{3889}just announced their intention|to fertilize an egg...
{3891}{3939}without the use of sperm cells.
{3979}{4011}I don't understand that.
{4013}{4108}Every cell in the human body|contains a copy of the genome pattern.
{4111}{4182}The only reason sperm cells|have all the fun is that up until now...
{4185}{4231}they were the only ones with access.
{4233}{4287}Within Christopher's lifetime,|artificial insemination...
{4290}{4373}will render sperm as useless|as an assembly line worker in Detroit.
{4375}{4455}Luckily, my accountant set up a golden|parachute for my sperm years ago.
{4458}{4511}In case they were downsized.
{4545}{4629}Just so you know, Roger,|you know that we women...
{4659}{4719}make love because we like it.
{4722}{4771}- Not just to procreate.|- Yes.
{4774}{4868}- But are men absolutely necessary?.|- I don't know that.
{4871}{4916}Think of the structure|of the female genitalia.
{4919}{4982}Wait. Wait.|Okay, got it.
{5011}{5071}What is the most sensitive part|of the vagina?.
{5074}{5165}-I can't believe we've gotten into this.|-I thinkyou know this, Donovan.
{5167}{5262}It's the clitoris, first discovered|by Renaldus Columbus in 1 559.
{5265}{5297}He thought it was India.
{5347}{5396}Oh, no!. No!.
{5399}{5475}The crown of the clitoris|contains 8,000 nerve fibers.
{5477}{5547}It's a far great concentration|than in any part of the male body...
{5549}{5579}even our fingertips.
{5581}{5655}It is the most efficient,|pleasure-delivery system...
{5658}{5699}ever devised by nature.
{5701}{5740}Now, ask yourself...
{5743}{5819}why didn't the clitoris end up|inside the vagina...
{5821}{5881}so that intercourse|would be naturally...
{5883}{5948}compellingly, constantly pleasurable|for a woman?.
{5951}{6003}- I know the answer.|- Yes, Ms. Maynard.
{6006}{6121}Because in primitive time,|women died of childbirth.
{6123}{6192}So for intercourse to be|too pleasurable...
{6195}{6257}wouldn't make sense|from a Darwinian standpoint.
{6259}{6331}- I'm impressed.|- Absolutely right.
{6333}{6407}- What does that tell us?.|- Evolution is looking out for us girls?.
{6410}{6452}- Exactly.|- That for women...
{6455}{6545}intercourse and sexual fulfillment|were never intended to intersect.
{6581}{6633}New technology|just makes it official.
{6635}{6752}Future generations ofwomen will evolve|clitorises-- "clitori, clitorati"--
{6755}{6785}"Clitorissimo."
{6878}{6963}that are larger, longer,|even more sensitive.
{6966}{7040}And a woman's ability, as well as|her desire to self-stimulate...
{7043}{7088}will increase exponentially...
{7091}{7148}as intercourse is robbed|of its procreative utility.
{7179}{7223}- I'm confused and frightened.|- You should be.
{7225}{7316}The species is not static.|We're in a constant state of flux.
{7319}{7390}Two genders has been|the default setting for one reason only:
{7393}{7447}So far it's been the only way|to propagate the race.
{7450}{7495}Is there any species|that just has one gender...
{7498}{7558}that doesn't have male/female?.
{7561}{7595}Starfish, for one.
{7597}{7672}Next time I see a starfish,|I'm gonna tell him to go fuck himself.
{7713}{7745}Come on. You love it.
{7775}{7817}No, we don't.
{7851}{7895}So where are we headed?.
{7898}{7949}Equality?.|Equality, what is that?.
{7991}{8023}Is that a principle of nature?.
{8025}{8091}We all sit around|reading subway maps together.
{8094}{8145}No. Of course not.|Natural selection.
{8147}{8208}Now that is a principle of nature.
{8211}{8272}Selection. Something has to lose.|Something has to be defeated...
{8275}{8329}in order for something else|to be selected.
{8331}{8379}So, what does this mean?.
{8454}{8516}We have to take orders from Joyce|for the rest of lives.
{8539}{8579}That's right. I like that.
{8582}{8650}It means that 1 0 or 1 5 generations|from now...
{8652}{8701}men will be reduced to servitude.
{8748}{8799}Technology and evolution|will have combined...
{8802}{8867}to exclude sperm from procreation...
{8870}{8963}and our final destiny will be|to lift couches...
{8966}{9046}and wait for that day|when telepathy overcomes gravity...
{9048}{9163}and our gender's last remaining utility|is lost forever.
{9166}{9197}Forever.
{9214}{9255}Oh, my God, Roger.
{9327}{9409}- What?. I'm done.|- Then I rest my case.
{9522}{9557}Thank you.
{9601}{9640}Love you people.
{9829}{9864}Yeah, this is good.
{11180}{11247}-Jesus!.|- No, just me.
{11287}{11332}How did you get in here?.
{11399}{11468}- Where did you get those?.|- Copied them from yours.
{11471}{11562}- When?.|- Last week when you sent me for bagels.
{11621}{11651}Give them to me.
{11653}{11712}Aren't you tired of constantly|having to buzz me in here?.
{11715}{11801}See how your brain works?. How does|once a week turn into "constantly"?.
{11803}{11901}Actually, last week was two times,|including, I believe, Friday...
{11903}{12008}when you woke me out of a dead, pleasant|sleep and demanded the use of my body.
{12011}{12062}- You could have said no.|- What?. Are you kidding me?.
{12065}{12105}That was a call to action.
{12107}{12160}I dressed in 30 seconds|like a volunteer fireman.
{12163}{12186}I was insane--
{12188}{12271}You should stop talking and listen|to me. I got something to say to you.
{12274}{12307}Oh, yeah?.
{12309}{12387}- Words are my stock-in-trade,Joyce.|- I know.
{12389}{12455}You can't just|stop up the floodgate.
{12457}{12504}- Put that down.|- What?.
{12540}{12581}- We need to stop this.|- Stop what?.
{12583}{12648}God, I love watching you|in the bathroom.
{12651}{12757}You're like an athlete after the game,|scraping off the war paint.
{12759}{12815}I meant, we need to stop|seeing each other.
{12818}{12857}Oh, really?.
{12901}{12947}This whole thing was a bad idea.
{12949}{13024}Generally, I have good judgment,|but this time, right out the window.
{13027}{13108}This whole thing is a great idea.|Nobody knows about us.
{13111}{13163}We all go out, I sit there and...
{13166}{13207}you know, a few hours later...
{13210}{13257}I know I'm going to be|the traveling salesman...
{13259}{13315}and you're going to be|the lonely housewife.
{13318}{13434}I need you to be an adult about this.|No scenes.
{13436}{13514}Joyce, I am your boy.|I'm your thoroughbred.
{13516}{13579}Adult. Understand?.
{13619}{13694}Forget about the keys, okay?.|Just keep the keys with--
{13906}{14019}Tonight is our last night,|so let's make it a good one.
{14118}{14157}Good-bye sex is never good.
{14159}{14207}Next week, we'll have|"get back together" sex--
{14399}{14460}- Can I stay the night?.|- Roger, no.
{16561}{16592}Right.
{16897}{16984}Hi. Can I have a Cosmo and|a Maker's Mark on the rocks?. Thanks.
{16987}{17070}- Let's have a talk.|- I'm sorry. I'm with some people.
{17073}{17101}Let me guess.
{17159}{17202}You're relatively new at the company.
{17204}{17299}Maybe you moved to New York from|somewhere else. Somewhere friendly.
{17358}{17411}First you took pride in being alone.
{17413}{17480}Wanna make a name foryourself|in the big city.
{17483}{17570}After a while, you started thinking|how it might be nice to meet somebody.
{17572}{17659}Winter's not far off,|and it gets lonely sometimes.
{17689}{17747}Okay. And?.
{17766}{17838}And so you develop a crush|on your supervisor...
{17885}{17943}even though the other women|in the office tell you...
{17946}{17994}" Keep clear. He's bad news."
{17997}{18051}- Why is he bad news?.|- Because he's a player.
{18071}{18132}He's a guy who collects trophies.
{18135}{18198}Every woman who takes a job there|ends up in bed with him.
{18233}{18279}And ifyou give in to temptation...
{18281}{18363}you'll end up the punch line|to a sordid joke by the water cooler.
{18366}{18401}Am I hot or cold?.
{18469}{18539}- It's a good story.|- It's a cliche.
{18542}{18589}So what do you do|when you're not reducing the world?.
{18591}{18655}What's wrong with reduction,|boiling things down to their essence?.
{18658}{18751}What's wrong with...|seeing what's really going on?.
{18754}{18827}And what's really going on?.|What's the big revelation?.
{18850}{18892}Why should I tell you?.
{18895}{18950}Telling you|isn't going to change anything.
{18952}{19059}For instance, I could tell you that|what you think of as your personality...
{19061}{19127}is nothing but a collection|of Van aarticles.
{19130}{19236}I could tell you your choice|of sexual partners this evening...
{19239}{19307}was decided months ago by some|account executive at Young  Rubicam.
{19310}{19387}I could tell you that|given a week to study your father...
{19389}{19440}and the ways|in which he ignores you...
{19443}{19523}I could come up with a schtick|you'd be helpless to resist. Helpless.
{19635}{19704}I could tell you all that, but what|would you do with the information?.
{19707}{19766}Are there women|who fall for this stuff?.
{19798}{19837}I'm telling the truth as I see it.
{19839}{19906}You wanna go fuckyour boss?.|What business is it of mine.
{20009}{20090}He's not Daddy.|He's just a guy in a suit.
{20204}{20297}You feel compelled to contribute|to the pathetic...
{20299}{20370}heartbreaking predictability of it all,|by all means--
{20871}{20907}- Hi.|- Hi.
{21015}{21108}- You waiting for someone?.|- Yeah, my fiance.
{21111}{21192}- Hey, congratulations.|- Thanks.
{21255}{21325}All right. Congratulations.
{21439}{21475}Is he a kind man,|your fiance?.
{21478}{21525}Does he treat you with respect?.
{21552}{21618}Not that it's any ofyour business,|but, yes, he does.
{21650}{21740}- That must make you nervous.|- Why would that make me nervous?.
{21743}{21802}Oh, come on.
{21804}{21873}Look at the time.|Let's do the math together.
{21875}{21916}What are you talking about?.
{21919}{21995}Let me guess, low self-esteem...
{21998}{22120}and premenopausal... concern|led you to pursue a series of--
{22166}{22199}semiabusive relationships?.
{22201}{22307}But a recent dose of therapy|has convinced you...
{22310}{22362}that inner-beauty|is what really matters, and...
{22407}{22531}you really deserve that perfect partner|who treats you with such respect.
{22534}{22580}Do you want me to call|the bartender?.
{22583}{22629}Unless you're an idiot--|which I don't thinkyou are--
{22631}{22677}unless you're some kind|of pathetic, self-help junkie...
{22679}{22742}you and I know your guy's gonna|wake up one morning, and--
{22773}{22829}he's gonna look around,|figure out how old you are...
{22831}{22907}and what you're really like,|and that's the day he's gonna go out...
{22910}{22957}for a pack of smokes|and never come back.
{22975}{23019}By that time--|How you doing?.
{23050}{23121}If she doesn't see what's coming,|I fucking weep for her.
{23442}{23496}- Can I help you, sir?.|- Hey. No, thanks. I'm good.
{23499}{23541}I said, "Can I help you, sir?'
{23586}{23679}- Where's that other guy?. The--|- He's home sleeping.
{23681}{23771}Okay. Well, it's very important that|I see Joyce Maynard right away, so--
{23774}{23837}Okay. I understand.|Why don't I just leave her a note?.
{23898}{23939}It's important|that I see her in person.
{23942}{24004}That's not gonna work,|so why don't I...
{24007}{24063}call you a cab and you go home|and sleep it off?.
{24066}{24116}Why don't you go fucking home?.
{24119}{24181}Okay. You know what?.|We don't understand each other.
{24183}{24277}I'm her boy. I'm her boy, okay?.|Who are you?. Who are you?.
{24279}{24385}I am the man who's gonna call the police|ifyou don't get out of my lobby!.
{25590}{25669}an| a an  an  a
{26588}{26639}n |- Who is it?.
{26642}{26713}an  n aan|-Which new campai gn?. Get a name, please.
{26771}{26848}an|- T ell her I'm out.
{26851}{26919}a  an|- T ell her I'm out.
{27080}{27167}Yeah. This is, like, surly.|That's like, "What is that?. "
{27170}{27213}- And this is, like--|- You want surly?.
{27215}{27267}-This is like '90s, adorable normal guy.|-I am that.
{27270}{27315}- That's your problem.|- That's your nightmare.
{27318}{27391}Hey, |You going to Joyce's tonight?.
{27429}{27468}What?.
{27486}{27559}- Didn't you get the E-mail?.|- What E-mail?.
{27626}{27664}About the party?.
{27689}{27723}You going?.
{27726}{27789}Joyce throws a party,|I don't ask questions. I just show up.
{28037}{28074}She's on a conference call.
{28076}{28138}Ted, there's someone|in my office.
{28141}{28193}- Bye, Ted.|- It's okay, Donna, you can--
{28195}{28265}- Bye, Donna.|- I'll call you back in five minutes.
{28267}{28358}"Five minutes"?.|This is a five-minute situation?.
{28360}{28400}Sit down.
{28403}{28452}I don't wish to sit down.|I wish to stand.
{28476}{28523}Did you try to get|into my building last night?.
{28579}{28642}Why am I not invited tonight?.|Everyone will be there except me.
{28644}{28692}What is that going to look like?.
{28747}{28817}- Let's reestablish some boundaries.|- Let's not.
{28863}{28936}I'm your boss.|You work for me.
{28939}{28991}You write very good copy.
{29027}{29153}But I have a hundred resumes|on my files for guys just like you.
{29155}{29220}But do those guys|do that thing that I do?.
{29223}{29265}The thing that you like?.
{29286}{29402}I have explained to you that I do not|wish to see you socially any longer.
{29600}{29647}Find a way to deal with it.
{29916}{29967}What's that supposed to do?.
{30737}{30765}Nick?.
{30819}{30863}Uncle Roger.|How's it going?.
{30904}{30947}What are you doing here?.
{30970}{31035}What?. Oh.|I wanted to see where you work.
{31063}{31152}- Yes. No. What are you doing here?.|- What?.
{31155}{31220}- You mean here in New York here?.|- Yes.
{31223}{31307}I had an interview at Columbia,|so Mom said I should lookyou up.
{31310}{31380}- Sit down.|- Okay.
{31383}{31428}That's what all the phone calls|were about.
{31431}{31487}- The phone calls?.|- Yeah. Your mom's been calling me.
{31490}{31577}- Did you speak to her?.|- We're playing phone tag.
{31579}{31633}She said you could|show me what you do here.
{31635}{31683}She did?.
{31685}{31761}Well, there's not a whole lot|to show you, Nick.
{31763}{31841}Really?. Like, what do you do all day?.
{31843}{31891}What do I do all day?.
{31914}{31979}I sit here and think ofways|to make people feel bad.
{32018}{32083}- I thought you wrote for commercials.|- I do...
{32086}{32157}but you can't sell a product|without first making people feel bad.
{32176}{32207}Why not?.
{32273}{32320}Because it's a substitution game.
{32347}{32409}You have to remind them that they're|missing something from their lives.
{32411}{32455}Everyone's missing something, right?.
{32458}{32504}- Well, yeah. I guess.|- Trust me.
{32507}{32569}And when they're feeling|sufficiently incomplete...
{32571}{32646}you convince them that your product is|the only thing that can fill the void.
{32648}{32702}So, instead of taking steps|to deal with their lives...
{32704}{32794}instead ofworking to root out|the real reason for their misery...
{32796}{32866}they run out and buy|a stupid-looking pair of cargo pants.
{33069}{33159}- So... is it fun?.|- It can be.
{33162}{33229}Look, I actually was about|to call it a day.
{33231}{33279}That's cool.|We can go get something to eat.
{33343}{33428}- Fine. Let's get out of here.|- Great.
{34019}{34087}You gave me a scare. I thought you|were having a narcoleptic episode.
{34090}{34175}- What?. When?.|- Back at the office, you know?.
{34211}{34271}That's standing meditation.|It calms me down. Thanks.
{34274}{34331}Why should you calm down?.|You're a teenager. Thankyou.
{34334}{34381}My brain gets all sloppy|when I'm stressed...
{34383}{34447}so the meditation helps me focus|and block out the bad stuff.
{34450}{34516}- Bad stuff?.|- Like fear and pain, you know?.
{34519}{34608}It's a visualization. I picture|a blue triangle, and that's me.
{34611}{34697}I put all the other stuff outside|the triangle in a red field. It works.
{34755}{34798}So, how's your folks?.
{34919}{34992}- They got divorced.|- What?.
{34995}{35043}Yeah. My dad moved out.
{35046}{35103}- You're kidding. When did this happen?.|- A while ago.
{35106}{35163}I haven't seen you|since Grandma's funeral.
{35309}{35360}- Jesus, Nick. I'm sorry to hear that.|- It's no big deal.
{35363}{35422}I still talk to my dad.|He calls from the road.
{35425}{35461}How's your mom doing?.
{35463}{35496}She's fine. You know.
{35545}{35600}- Surprised she didn't come with you.|- Maybe she was afraid to see you...
{35603}{35647}after what happened at the funeral.
{35650}{35723}That happened because|your grandfather's a king-size prick.
{35783}{35821}All right?.
{36042}{36084}So when's your interview?.
{36117}{36178}- It was today.|- How'd it go?.
{36180}{36237}Fine, I guess. I did the interviews|'cause Mom wants me to.
{36239}{36305}- You're not interested in college?.|- Why keep going to school...
{36307}{36369}when anything I need to find out about|I can look up myself?.
{36371}{36437}Dad didn't go to college. By the time|he was my age, he was on the road.
{36439}{36495}- How is everything here?.|- First-rate. Thanks.
{36535}{36659}But... the good thing about college|is you get to hang out a lot.
{36662}{36719}- It's good for the social skills.|- Yeah.
{36819}{36944}So... my mom says you're kind of,|you know, like a ladies' man.
{36947}{37024}- She said that?.|- But she says it like it's a bad thing.
{37027}{37074}That sounds like her.
{37093}{37175}- Is it true?.|- What about you?. You have a girlfriend?.
{37218}{37313}No. I mean, you know, not yet.
{37350}{37461}Look. I'm getting older, and there's|a lot of stuff that I wish I could--
{37547}{37651}There's a lot of stuff that I haven't--|There's certain things I need to--
{37654}{37701}Yeah. I thought you said|you could look that stuff up.
{37703}{37751}No. I mean, not this.
{37754}{37820}You don't understand. I need|someone who knows what to say--
{37823}{37889}I'm kidding you, Nick.|That's what college is for.
{37891}{38011}You find some football player who needs|tutoring, and he helps you get girls.
{38014}{38085}- You don't get it.|- I get it. I was 1  once, all right?.
{38107}{38164}What are you going to do|ifyou don't go to college?.
{38167}{38223}Design software.|Maybe work on simulation games.
{38226}{38285}That's right. You're the computer whiz.|There is money in that.
{38287}{38335}I already make money|setting up systems for people.
{38337}{38395}I'm working on a web page|for Granddad for his research.
{38397}{38458}What, the old man?.|He's actually spending money?.
{38460}{38489}Yeah, good money too.
{38491}{38548}It's funny, 'cause he yells|at his computer like it's a person.
{38551}{38600}He's always going,|"That bitch ate my file."
{38603}{38687}- Or, "She's playing hard to get."|- You spend a lot of time there?.
{38690}{38713}Yeah, nowadays.
{38715}{38792}I go over after school, and he|comes over and eats dinner with us.
{38795}{38887}Wait a minute.|He eats dinner with you and Susan?.
{38890}{38983}Sure. Since Grandma died,|there's no one taking care ofhim.
{38986}{39055}Even after they split up,|she went over every day to cook dinner.
{39058}{39145}I mean, every single day.|She was nuts.
{39257}{39304}Yeah, she was nuts.
{39399}{39431}So, Nick.
{39479}{39530}You need some help with the ladies?.
{39612}{39666}All right. Here we go.|Get this straight.
{39667}{39768}Sex is everywhere, okay?.|It is all around us.
{39771}{39841}It's not some distant destination.|It's not Everest.
{39843}{39929}It is right here.|You have to attune yourself to it.
{39931}{39977}You have to bring yourself|into alignment.
{39979}{40025}You have to find|the zone, Nick. Okay?.
{40027}{40114}Do that, and I promise you|a whole world will open up.
{40142}{40223}Look at me. I walk around|in a state of total receptivity.
{40225}{40304}- I'm like a fucking lightning rod.|- All right. Fine. What do I do?.
{40335}{40407}For starters, let's get rid of that|little meditation. The blue triangle.
{40410}{40494}We don't block things out, Nicholas.|We let them in.
{40497}{40530}Let what in?.
{40532}{40588}There are millions ofwomen|in this city.
{40591}{40668}Millions. Most ofthem are blessedly|unaware of the countless ways...
{40671}{40736}in which their bodies|are exposed to our eyes.
{40739}{40803}So, first, learn to read the sun,|where it sits.
{40806}{40943}You'll notice... correlation between|backlighting and transparency.
{40945}{41018}They wear light-colored clothing,|underwear shows right through.
{41020}{41091}Bra straps, panty lines.|No need to stretch or squint.
{41093}{41192}It is there for us, okay?.|For example--
{41375}{41400}What?.
{41403}{41460}Are you blowing my cover|like some construction worker?.
{41463}{41535}- No. I was just--|- Use your head.
{41557}{41659}Step back. Let her pass.|Okay?. Give it a few seconds.
{41662}{41743}Watch this, and then camouflage|the move. Pay attention.
{41845}{41909}Checking of the watch is good.|Or of the pager.
{41911}{41973}Or looking for|a street sign like you're lost.
{41975}{42038}You saw me do a combination.|Whatever it is, don't get caught.
{42040}{42103}Do you think women have a clue|what goes on up here?.
{42106}{42191}What do they think,|it's just stock quotes, drill bit sizes?.
{42194}{42258}They don't know shit!|Let's keep it that way.
{42261}{42351}- All right.|- Watch. What about your eyes?.
{42354}{42415}- What?. My eyes?.|- Your eyes. How's your vision?.
{42418}{42479}- No, it's good. It's 20-20.|- Okay. Peripheral?.
{42482}{42547}- I don't know. It's fine, I guess.|- Fine's not gonna cut it.
{42550}{42633}You gotta workyour muscles like you're|training for the fucking Olympics.
{42635}{42702}- Yeah.|- Up, down, left, right, et cetera.
{42773}{42814}- Here. Follow my finger.|- Okay.
{42816}{42855}- Tell me when it's gone.|- All right.
{42876}{42933}- Okay. Stop.|- That's it?.
{42935}{42986}You need a hundred,|a hundred and ten degrees...
{42989}{43043}before you're ready for the street.
{43046}{43093}I see behind me on a good day.
{43111}{43147}- You play video games?.|- Sure.
{43150}{43195}Good. That stuff is training|for the eyes.
{43198}{43221}Registering images|in a split second.
{43223}{43274}It's invaluable.|Oh. Right there.
{43277}{43338}Blue sweater. Blue sweater.|Median. Blue sweater. Blue sweater.
{43432}{43498}That young lady just--|And you missed it.
{43500}{43549}- I know.|- In just a fraction of a second.
{43551}{43640}That's all. But a trained eye|can get in there for a look.
{43643}{43704}You have to learn to anticipate|your opportunities, okay?.
{43707}{43754}Getting out of a cab,|wind from a subway grate...
{43757}{43855}or as you so sadly missed there,|bending over to pick something up.
{43858}{43927}These are situations which require|lightning reflexes.
{43930}{44010}- I tell you, I can do that.|- Your a step slow right now, Nick.
{44012}{44098}Hey, no wonder.|I remember what it's like out there.
{44100}{44135}No interaction. No face time.
{44138}{44214}Look at me. Every day I have|the street, the subway, the ATM line...
{44216}{44266}the office, the gym, the--
{44269}{44309}What have you got?.
{44311}{44373}Young people sitting in cars in Ohio.
{44375}{44423}Wistful glances at the stoplight.
{44425}{44469}No, I go to school.|That's interaction.
{44471}{44510}Okay. Let's work with that.
{44512}{44569}The high school building|is four stories, if memory serves.
{44571}{44616}- It's five stories now.|- Whatever.
{44619}{44696}It's multistory, and that means stairs,|which is good.
{44699}{44782}Free yourself from the tyranny|of eye level. Come here.
{44784}{44833}Use the angles.|High for cleavage.
{44874}{44957}- Low for the skirts.|- All right.
{44959}{45046}Remember, there's no shame|in calling on an old standby, right?.
{45049}{45115}Dropping of the pencil. Tying of|the shoe.Just don't telegraph it.
{45117}{45178}What about reflective surfaces?.|Mirrors, windows?.
{45181}{45231}What, in school?.|No, there's no mirrors.
{45234}{45291}What about that ugly|glass trophy case that--
{45294}{45340}- Yeah, that's there.|- Well, use it. It's perfect.
{45343}{45422}Go stand over there for a second.|Keep going. Keep going. Stop.
{45455}{45535}Ifyou can't stare directly,|turn your back and use the glass.
{45537}{45566}Hi, gorgeous.
{45569}{45651}Remember, angle of incidence|equals angle of reflectives.
{45654}{45739}In other words, ifyou can see them,|they can see you. So be alert.
{45742}{45795}- This is really complicated.|- It's rocket science.
{45798}{45859}- You were smart to ask for help.|- I have a good one.
{45862}{45903}When they're wearing short sleeves...
{45906}{45979}and they raise their arms to fix their|hair, you can see in that gap there.
{45982}{46060}Now, see?. That shows me|you're using your faculties.
{46063}{46127}- Don't they know we can see in there?.|- Of course they do.
{46130}{46196}Breasts are very sensitive.|They know when they're exposed to air.
{46239}{46325}Are women gonna walk around with|their hands clamped to their sides?. No.
{46327}{46380}Their hair has to be|dealt with eventually...
{46383}{46479}and it is our job,|it is ourvocation to be ready.
{46482}{46566}All right. So all this looking is fine,|but how do you take the next step?.
{46569}{46616}I need to meet someone.
{46722}{46771}Ifyou can't see|how the two things are related...
{46774}{46815}there's nothing I can do foryou.
{46818}{46875}- Wait. Relax. Come on.|- You think we are kidding around here?.
{46878}{46930}- Do you think this is a joke?.|- No. Why do you think I'm here?.
{46932}{47022}- You have got to make sex a presence...|- I'm sorry.
{47024}{47071}- in your mind, in your life...|- All right.
{47073}{47116}- in your spirit.|- I'm sorry.
{47217}{47300}- All right.|- What?. No. I don't smoke.
{47303}{47342}Better learn.
{47419}{47488}- Okay.|- Come on.
{47697}{47744}Here. Wait here.
{48200}{48256}Okay. Stay on this side of me.
{48403}{48439}Excuse us.
{48563}{48622}In, in, in.|Go, go, go. Hurry.
{48700}{48735}Oh, yeah.
{48823}{48865}Okay. We're in.
{48891}{48920}Good.
{48923}{48999}So, first, a survey of the terrain.
{49125}{49174}Technically, it's still happy hour.
{49199}{49278}Your casual drinkers have yet|to pack it in. Lots of groups.
{49280}{49356}Not exactly ideal for our purposes,|but not impossible.
{49359}{49420}So, we need to make an impression.
{49423}{49506}Send out a signal that back here|is the place to be.
{49508}{49565}All right. What do you do?.|What do you say?.
{49567}{49616}Who cares?.|You're overcomplicating it.
{49619}{49686}You spend the whole night sitting here|thinking of the perfect line...
{49688}{49725}what good is that?.
{49727}{49847}Just make contact. Separate yourself|from the rabble. Watch this.
{49932}{50003}Hey! Roses. Rosebud.
{50043}{50085}Hi. Come here.
{50087}{50131}Come here. Come here. Come here.
{50279}{50366}Hi. Could you--
{50369}{50433}Could I get you to take a-- Yeah.
{50526}{50606}- Hey.|- Nick here thinks you're beautiful.
{50643}{50715}If he's got such good taste,|what's he doing hanging out with you?.
{50741}{50777}Good question. Nick?.
{50878}{50969}- Because he's my uncle?.|- How awful foryou.
{51051}{51087}And so on.|No big deal, right?.
{51090}{51153}Now she's aware of our presence,|and we can plot our strategy.
{51155}{51238}I'm gonna get us some drinks.|While I'm there, think of a hook.
{51261}{51347}- What?. A hook?.|- A hook. A line. An opening salvo.
{51350}{51444}Any minute now, Rosebud|is going to be standing right here...
{51447}{51507}Iooking down at you,|and you're going to have one chance...
{51510}{51597}to either hit it out of the park|or strike out miserably.
{51625}{51653}Be ready.
{52507}{52558}Oh, shit. Oh, shit.|Oh, shit.
{52615}{52666}Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
{52752}{52837}Hello, Nick. Your uncle says|you have something to tell me...
{52839}{52905}that will absolutely blow my mind.
{52955}{53042}- Oh, yeah?.|- Yeah. Those were his exact words.
{53094}{53144}Is he playing a little joke on us?.
{53220}{53275}No, no. He's serious.
{53277}{53338}I mean, he's... totally serious.
{53362}{53410}- Tonight.|- Sorry.
{53475}{53538}Thanks. As I was--
{53541}{53588}- Tonight.|- Right, I was saying that...
{53623}{53674}I was saying that tonight is a--
{53676}{53741}Tonight is|a very important night for me.
{53743}{53806}I was just telling her|that we made a bet.
{53809}{53888}- A bet?.|- Uh-huh. We made a bet for $1,000.
{53971}{54039}That I can get somebody to...
{54042}{54090}Iike, fall in love with me.
{54165}{54207}Really?.
{54275}{54355}Love. That's a hard thing to verify,|don't you think?.
{54358}{54415}No, I think we can do it.
{54418}{54461}I'm confident we can.
{54502}{54535}A thousand dollars?.
{54537}{54586}That's not exactly mind-blowing...
{54589}{54671}but it's not the worse line|I'll hear tonight.
{54700}{54746}What?. Really?.
{54767}{54828}Yeah. Good job, Nick.
{54831}{54896}- So, do we rate a sit-down?.|- I'm waiting for a friend.
{54899}{54944}I'll run it by her|when she shows up.
{54947}{55011}Get her over here.|There's cash at stake.
{55014}{55105}Ifwe do, who sits with who?.
{55107}{55168}Ladies' choice.|Natural selection.
{55311}{55367}I wanna sit with him.
{55431}{55479}Yes, yes.
{55787}{55815}What is this?.
{55818}{55885}Rum and coke. I told him to mix it weak.|We got a long way to go here.
{55887}{55956}- Okay. I don't drink.|- You kidding me?. Take a drink.
{55959}{56041}- I don't put alcohol into my body.|- You drink that drink.
{56083}{56158}Loss of inhibition is crucial|to your success tonight, okay?.
{56161}{56227}Alcohol has been a social lubricant|for thousands ofyears.
{56230}{56313}You thinkyou're gonna sit here tonight|and reinvent the wheel?. Please.
{56445}{56564}All right. Now, you did one|very good thing. You lied.
{56567}{56639}You made something up.|Keep that part ofyour brain working.
{56642}{56726}We get those girls over here, your first|instinct is gonna be to open up.
{56728}{56808}To tell the truth.|Fight it! Just keep it interesting.
{56811}{56892}Play up your novelty.|You're a 1 6-year-old in a bar.
{56895}{56988}Why?. "My father owns the bar."|You got a month to live.
{56991}{57057}You're an actor researching--|I don't know. Improvise.
{57059}{57117}Next, check the time.|What time is it?.
{57119}{57158}It's about 72.
{57161}{57241}- Do you have a MedicAlert bracelet?.|- No, it's instructions.
{57243}{57308}I'm having my body cryogenically frozen|if I die prematurely.
{57483}{57535}All right. Leave it.|It's spastic enough to be charming.
{57538}{57595}So, the time. 70.
{57598}{57682}We've got nine hours|until closing time. An eternity.
{57702}{57752}Look at me, Nick,|and answer me this question.
{57755}{57796}All right.
{57827}{57913}Who is the greatest basketball player|in the history of the game?.
{57949}{58008}- Do you mean ever?.|- Come on. This is easy.
{58041}{58087}- Michael Jordan?.|- Michael Jordan.
{58089}{58144}Why was he the greatest?.|Because he paced himself.
{58147}{58200}Because he always|had something left at the finish.
{58203}{58264}Magic Johnson called it "winning time."|See those guys over there?.
{58350}{58416}Yeah. Those guys think|they're kicking ass.
{58419}{58460}Believe me, it is early.
{58463}{58515}We are a long way from winning time,|so pay attention.
{58518}{58567}- Okay.|- You say you want it.
{58570}{58609}Ifyou really wanted it...
{58632}{58718}you'd be in here, suffering the tortures|of the damned with those guys.
{58721}{58774}- What?.|- There's a big difference between...
{58777}{58859}being horny and being willing|to put in the time night after night--
{58861}{58945}I want it. Okay?. I go to high school.|You don't think that's torture?.
{58947}{58999}This is a lot of information.
{59002}{59050}I'm giving you|the keys to the kingdom.
{59053}{59083}Yeah, I know.
{59086}{59138}How many boys your age|get an opportunity like this?.
{59141}{59164}Yes.
{59167}{59233}So, stickyour finger down your throat.|Drink ice water, call it gin--
{59235}{59322}I don't care what you do. Be ready|to dive in at the moment of truth.
{59383}{59482}So... how often do you, like...
{59510}{59569}you know, like, get somebody|to go home with you?.
{59635}{59673}Every night.
{59691}{59716}Bullshit.
{59719}{59783}Just because you're not having sex,|doesn't mean the rest of us...
{59786}{59829}are sitting around playing cribbage.
{59887}{59923}What's cribbage?.
{59971}{60022}- What?. What?.|- Here we go. Here we go.
{60047}{60104}Here they come. This is so stupid.|They're, like, twice my age.
{60107}{60179}Champions refuse to lose.|Be like Mike.
{60182}{60243}Here we are. As promised.|For one drink.
{60246}{60353}- I'm Andrea, and this is Sophie.|- I'm Roger. This is my nephew, Nick.
{60355}{60411}- Hi.|- He really is, like, 1 6.
{60414}{60459}- I told you.|- Sit down.
{60462}{60509}How'd you get in here, Nick?.
{60511}{60601}It's funny you should... ask me that.
{60603}{60700}'Cause we were, before,|discussing it, and--
{60727}{60754}Neveryou mind.
{60756}{60818}I'm enjoying the air of intrigue|Nick brings to our booth.
{60820}{60881}- Cheers, everyone.|- I told Sophie about your little bet.
{60883}{60919}She thinks you're full of it.
{60921}{60958}There's nothing little|about a thousand dollars.
{60961}{61023}He's got to get someone|to fall in love with him?.
{61026}{61087}- A woman.|- A woman?.
{61090}{61166}Does it have to be a woman?.|What if some guy takes a shine to you?.
{61203}{61263}I guess that would count, 'cause we|never discussed what gender--
{61265}{61355}If Nick is willing to exploit that|little loophole, he can have the money.
{61358}{61418}- What were you guys talking about?.|- I don't know.
{61421}{61515}- What were we talking about?.|- We were talking about women.
{61518}{61601}Specifically, the pleasure to be derived|from admiring the female form.
{61642}{61702}Imagine what it feels like|to be admired all day long.
{61704}{61771}- Really.|- You'd rather be completely anonymous?.
{61774}{61818}- Not completely anonymous.|- Not anonymous.
{61820}{61893}I myselfwould welcome the sensation|of a hundred pair of eyes...
{61895}{61953}caressing my... booty|as I walk down the street.
{61955}{61990}Guys always say that.
{61992}{62048}Yeah. "We'd love it ifwomen|were always staring."
{62051}{62078}We would.
{62081}{62155}You would love it if no woman ever|listened to a word you were saying...
{62158}{62247}and just kept her eyes locked on|your chest oryour crotch?.
{62250}{62304}If it led to having sex all the time,|I would not mind.
{62307}{62381}You could deal with never being heard,|never being taken seriously?.
{62383}{62455}If I had something that needed saying,|I would wait until right after sex.
{62495}{62571}Seriously, for a second,|just stop saying the obvious thing.
{62574}{62641}Think what it would be like|if on every bus...
{62643}{62725}there were huge pictures|ofyour naked body.
{62727}{62802}- And on every billboard--|- Magazine.
{62805}{62859}That's right--|it was just about your body.
{62862}{62958}There was so much time and money and|energy spent obsessing and analyzing...
{62961}{63037}trying to get a glimpse ofyour body,|that soon it felt like...
{63039}{63085}the world had forgotten|about everything else...
{63087}{63137}and you end up feeling...
{63139}{63204}disconnected from your own body,|like it's not even yours.
{63243}{63317}Ifyou're really serious about|avoiding the male gaze--
{63319}{63402}- If the goal is anonymity--|- I never said the goal was anonymity.
{63405}{63446}Here's a little suggestion, okay?.
{63449}{63502}Putting on makeup.|Styling your hair.
{63505}{63602}Wearing a killer outfit and coming to|a place like this on a Friday night.
{63604}{63679}That's when it gets interesting,|because at a certain point...
{63682}{63749}- you start internalizing the male gaze.|- Not the best course of action.
{63751}{63813}Male gaze. Madison Avenue.|Fucking patriarchy.
{63815}{63861}Whatever it is,|it's done its number on you.
{63863}{63943}Do you thinkyou have any control|over who you find attractive?.
{63946}{64010}- Of course we do.|- I think not, and I'll prove it to you.
{64013}{64140}Ask any woman, "What's the single most|attractive quality a man can possess?'
{64143}{64201}- And what do they invariably answer?.|- Sense of humor.
{64203}{64263}- Sense of humor.|- Sense of humor is huge. Definitely.
{64265}{64372}And yet, if two lean, mean,|play-by-their-own-rules...
{64375}{64482}motorcycle-riding men|strolled up to this booth...
{64484}{64578}and beat the shit out of us|two humorous guys, right...
{64598}{64657}and asked you out for a ride,|you would be weak at the knees.
{64659}{64715}- No way.|- Weak at the knees.
{64718}{64781}Well, actually, guys who ride cycles|are pretty sexy.
{64783}{64834}- Thank you. You see?.|- Sorry.
{64837}{64938}The fact is that touchy-feely, weepy,|in-touch-with-their-feelings guys...
{64941}{64987}make you sick--|you're repulsed by them.
{64990}{65053}Give me the Ice Age, okay?.|Survival of the fittest.
{65055}{65141}No mixed signals. No bullshit.
{65143}{65221}Just the meanest, hairiest bastard|wins all the time.
{65223}{65267}Let's change the subject right now.
{65269}{65383}You know, it's interesting.|All this looking is so masculine.
{65386}{65451}I mean, you guys|are just about the visuals.
{65454}{65519}Really. Why is it that when|I'm going down on a guy--
{65522}{65588}- Sophie!|- No, really.
{65591}{65647}Why is it|that when I'm doing my thing...
{65649}{65695}why is it that men|always insist on watching?.
{65697}{65767}Why can't you just close your eyes|and concentrate on the feeling?.
{65770}{65822}It's not the most flattering activity|for a woman.
{65825}{65890}I'm not sure that that's a--|Maybe we can help.
{65893}{65984}Nick, jump in here.|A woman is doing her thing.
{66015}{66062}Why do we have to watch?.
{66145}{66216}Well, maybe to make sure|that it's actually happening?.
{66243}{66302}I'll buy that.|Make sure we're not hallucinating.
{66304}{66393}And maybe to file it away, in case|it's a long time before the next one.
{66395}{66478}Two excellent answers. Perhaps you'd|elaborate on the filing it away part?.
{66481}{66517}File it away for what?.
{66563}{66622}- Oh. I don't know.|- Come on, Nick.
{66625}{66684}We're finally treading on|some familiar territory here.
{66687}{66767}Mom's in the kitchen|making Jell-O with fruit.
{66770}{66821}- You lockyourself in the bathroom--|- Don't sweat it, Nick.
{66823}{66869}I grew up with three brothers.
{66871}{66939}The closets were pornography museums.|More visuals.
{66959}{67007}You're right about the visual thing.
{67009}{67055}It always drives me nuts|when I hear a guy...
{67057}{67127}going on about something a girl does|that's supposed to be so sexy.
{67129}{67211}- Like what kind of thing?.|- Like how she flips her hair.
{67214}{67269}How she stands with one foot|to the side. It could be anything.
{67271}{67329}- What's wrong with that?.|- Because that's nothing.
{67331}{67376}That's just something she does.
{67379}{67451}And she probably only does it|because she saw it in a movie.
{67454}{67502}It's not their real stuff.
{67505}{67580}All that stuff-- the hair flips,|the mannerisms, the catch phrases.
{67583}{67672}They add up to the personality.|So they are what's real.
{67675}{67755}Yeah, but it's all the outside stuff.|That's fine in the beginning.
{67757}{67798}You need the outside stuff.
{67801}{67847}You need, like,|the reasons to be in love.
{67849}{67895}But you can get past that|to the part...
{67897}{67936}where the little tricks|don't mean anything.
{67939}{68013}I say you are attracted to|what is in front ofyou. End of story.
{68015}{68045}How romantic.
{68083}{68136}It takes years and years together.
{68139}{68178}- Yeah?.|- I can't describe it exactly...
{68180}{68232}but it's like there's nothing|she can do.
{68235}{68304}All her usual ways of hooking you in|have no effect...
{68307}{68354}and yet you're still in love.
{68357}{68403}It's like the act is over...
{68405}{68451}and you get to the part|she's been hiding.
{68454}{68545}And she's been hiding it|because she thinks that's the part...
{68547}{68627}that's gonna blow it|or make you leave or get bored...
{68629}{68714}but you get to that part,|and you're still there.
{68739}{68800}And you're even more in love.
{68914}{68943}Wow.
{68946}{69023}Have you met my nephew?.|His name is Jesus.
{69026}{69069}How old are you, Nick?.
{69071}{69103}I'm 1 6.
{69105}{69190}Stay strong, Sophie. There's|a thousand of my dollars at stake here.
{69192}{69255}Are we still on a one-drink limit?.
{69258}{69330}- I think we can have one more.|- Yeah, I'm in.
{69333}{69386}Great.|Scootch out of there, Sophie.
{69389}{69438}- Who wants what?.|- Sophie knows what I like.
{69441}{69503}- Just some ice water, please.|- Okay, that's charming.
{69506}{69533}Nick?.
{69535}{69629}A player might consider taking advantage|of this time alone with Andrea.
{69631}{69696}Andrea. Yeah.|You can take your time.
{69937}{69984}- Hi.|- Hey.
{70022}{70074}- What's the deal with your uncle?.|- I don't know.
{70077}{70155}This is really the first time|I've hung out with him socially.
{70176}{70250}- Do you live in the city?.|- I live in Ohio with my mom.
{70273}{70320}She and Roger|don't really speak anymore.
{70340}{70370}Ohio?.
{70395}{70446}Do you have a girlfriend back home?.
{70473}{70520}No. Not right now.
{70729}{70817}Nick, can you do me a favor?.
{70819}{70855}Okay.
{71103}{71145}Pick that up.
{71225}{71288}- Protein for stamina.|- Let's switch, Andrea.
{71291}{71353}- Okay. I suppose it's your turn.|- Yeah, good idea.
{71355}{71457}Keep things fresh|and help us fight that second-round lag.
{71459}{71521}- What's that?.|- That's a conversational lag...
{71523}{71603}that often occurs after the ordering|of the second round.
{71606}{71694}Actually, Nick was telling me about you|and your relationship with his mother.
{71697}{71785}- No secret there. She's my sister.|- Your relationship with her.
{71787}{71860}Not your relationship to her.|Nick says they don't speak.
{71863}{71937}That's terrible.|I mean, you need your family.
{71939}{72016}- Yeah.|- What do you think happened, Nick?.
{72041}{72119}My mom's a lot older than Roger.|Like nine years.
{72122}{72176}You must have been quite|the little surprise, Roger.
{72179}{72243}A nine-year gap doesn't necessarily mean|an unplanned pregnancy.
{72282}{72351}But, apparently, I did come|as a bit of a surprise.
{72353}{72400}Really?. I didn't know that.
{72403}{72460}That doesn't explain why you|and your sister don't get along.
{72463}{72527}Let's just say|we don't have much in common.
{72546}{72628}My mom says that when Roger was little,|he could talk himself out of anything.
{72631}{72682}He never got in trouble,|even when he got caught.
{72684}{72787}- She called him "Roger Dodger."|- That's perfect foryou.
{72789}{72868}There's nothing wrong with a high|verbal ability. Nick's got it too.
{72871}{72922}I wanna be like Granddad.|He almost never talks.
{72924}{72985}But when he does,|everyone kind of leans forward.
{72987}{73035}You know, my dad's like that.
{73037}{73100}The difference being that what|my father has to say is usually...
{73103}{73151}some variation on,|"Get me another scotch."
{73154}{73208}- Like father, like son?.|- No, like daughter.
{73211}{73250}- I get my--|- Whose daughter?.
{73252}{73313}- What do you mean, "like daughter?'|- No joke.
{73315}{73400}Mom keeps a bottle in the|laundry basket. She has foryears.
{73451}{73487}- Oh, God, Nick.|- That's awful.
{73490}{73578}She's not a wreck or anything.|She's just-- What do you call it?.
{73581}{73627}- High-functioning.|- Yeah. That's Susan all right.
{73630}{73677}She's always functioned|at a high level.
{73679}{73770}- She's just really high, you know?.|- How can you joke about that?.
{73772}{73833}You can joke about anything|that has to do with yourself.
{73835}{73883}It's a basic human right.|Isn't that right, Nick?.
{73915}{73979}I think that's constitutional|or something.
{73982}{74061}Freedom of speech.|Freedom to joke.
{74063}{74118}You know what?.|I need the ladies' room.
{74120}{74176}Let's let the boys discuss|these new revelations.
{74179}{74216}- Good idea.|- I don't-- All right.
{74219}{74254}All right.
{74308}{74355}Be careful.|We'll be waiting.
{74399}{74444}Are you sure you want|to get laid tonight?.
{74447}{74486}I thought you would|like to know that.
{74488}{74534}I am not the one|who is here to learn.
{74536}{74582}For most of us,|this is a forgetting place.
{74584}{74628}- All right?.|- We were talking about Granddad.
{74631}{74676}- I figured--|- You felt qualified to jump in...
{74679}{74724}and expound|on that particular topic?.
{74727}{74760}That's right. I'm sorry.
{74763}{74836}You're an expert on that subject now.|You guys are joined at the fucking hip.
{74839}{74884}I wanted to keep|the conversation going.
{74887}{74941}There are four of us|in this booth.
{74943}{74993}Think of it|as a game of bridge.
{75043}{75122}In bridge, you have|two sets of partners, okay?.
{75124}{75170}Ifyou hope to become|the kind of man...
{75172}{75218}that other men|choose to go into battle with...
{75220}{75277}you have to learn|to read your partner.
{75279}{75351}It should have been obvious I don't want|to talk about the family tonight.
{75375}{75405}A little while ago...
{75407}{75475}we were listening to Sophie|describe herself giving a blow job.
{75478}{75523}Don't you think that's|slightly more fertile ground...
{75526}{75589}than what's at the bottom|ofyour mother's laundry basket?.
{75635}{75702}Pull your weight and steer|the conversation back...
{75704}{75762}to something|in the same universe as sex.
{75764}{75847}Remember, the thing that was supposed|to be the primary focus this evening?.
{75850}{75890}Don't make me resort|to the fail-safe.
{75936}{76003}- Where are you going?.|- Excuse me.
{76006}{76054}No. Bad idea.
{76056}{76090}Ah,Jesus.
{76811}{76862}Everything okay over there?.
{76864}{76910}No. I can't go|with you standing there.
{76912}{76982}- Why not?.|- I just can't. Get out of here.
{76984}{77049}Can't go through life|with a shy bladder, Nick.
{77051}{77099}You're gonna be spending|a lot of time in bars.
{77101}{77148}Most of them will have restrooms|just like this one.
{77181}{77236}Fine. Then you go.|You go first.
{77239}{77310}I don't have to.|Just came in to rinse my hands.
{77351}{77385}Forget it.
{77495}{77561}- Let's go, kid.|- No, look. I'm with somebody.
{77589}{77647}Uncle Roger, could you|please tell him?. He doesn't--
{77650}{77707}- How you doing?.|- No, I don't know him.
{77709}{77755}- Bedtime, kid. Let's go.|- Uncle Roger.
{77757}{77804}- Come on, kid. Out.|- Could you please--
{77825}{77892}He's my-- Uncle Roger!|Really, go back in there.
{77931}{77975}Look, I'm an actor.|I'm researching a role.
{77978}{78025}- Good luck with that.|- Okay.
{78752}{78791}- You okay?.|- Oh, hey.
{78794}{78865}I guess I should've waited|to use the bathroom.
{78867}{78956}Okay. Unless the novelty of hanging out|with prom king here has worn off...
{78959}{79022}I suggest we get a bottle|and find someplace with a view.
{79115}{79194}- All right. Let's find a view.|- Let's find a view. Ladies.
{79667}{79722}- That was close.|- That's good. Thank you.
{79725}{79779}- This is the finest.|- That's good.Just a little bit.
{79782}{79809}Thankyou.
{79811}{79874}Just a little. That's good.|That's good.
{79922}{79965}- How do you like the wine?.|- I like it.
{79967}{80015}It makes my chest feel warm.
{80018}{80080}- Roger, you're a bad influence.|- Yes, I am.
{80083}{80140}- Alcohol, women of loose morals.|- And gambling.
{80143}{80178}That's right. Gambling.
{80180}{80233}I don't see Nick complaining.
{80235}{80291}Although I have to say,|forwomen ofloose morals...
{80316}{80390}conversation has been|pretty tame so far tonight.
{80414}{80495}With the notable exception|of Sophie's oral presentation.
{80497}{80523}Shut up.
{80526}{80616}It'd be helpful for Nick to hear more of|the female perspective of the sex act.
{80619}{80667}- Do you agree?.|- God.
{80686}{80726}Where to begin?.
{80728}{80775}Nick will get us started. Nick?.
{80882}{80917}Go ahead.
{80934}{80979}Ask away.|Any question you like.
{80982}{81010}Keep it interesting.
{81013}{81044}All right.
{81118}{81176}I guess I'd like to know|what your first time was like.
{81201}{81259}- That's what you come up with?.|- That is a great question.
{81261}{81292}Thankyou.
{81323}{81359}I'll go first.
{81437}{81513}- It was my junioryear.|- High school or college?.
{81546}{81583}High school.
{81586}{81652}His name was Bobby Rushton,|and we weren't even dating.
{81655}{81738}I just picked him out one day|and decided he was gonna be the one.
{81741}{81796}- Why did you pick him?.|- Sense of humor?.
{81821}{81891}Ha-ha. He was funny,|as I remember, but...
{81893}{81960}it was something more than that.
{81963}{82042}It was like this vibe.
{82044}{82091}I knew he would be nice.
{82094}{82180}He wasn't very popular, and I didn't|think he'd brag about me to his friends.
{82183}{82248}- That's half the fun.|- Well, he didn't.
{82251}{82298}He was just as nervous as I was.
{82327}{82377}Which is part of the reason|that I picked him...
{82379}{82456}because I think|I wanted to have some control.
{82459}{82530}- You know?.|- You were his first as well then?.
{82532}{82608}Yeah. In fact, I went with him|to go get the condoms.
{82611}{82659}We biked all the way across town...
{82662}{82722}because we were so afraid|someone might see us.
{82724}{82783}- We planned the thing for a month.|- I love this story.
{82803}{82885}- Yes.|- So, where did you, you know?.
{82925}{82986}It was in my house,|in my room.
{83006}{83053}My parents were away|for the weekend.
{83055}{83143}- Did you bleed?.|- The usual. Not too bad.
{83146}{83193}Wait. So it hurts the first time?.
{83236}{83292}Well, it really hurts...
{83329}{83376}that first second.
{83404}{83471}And then after that,|it's just new.
{83474}{83571}You know?. It's like this|new feeling foryour body.
{83574}{83608}So how was he?.
{83638}{83710}- Matter of seconds?.|- No way! He kept going like a champ.
{83713}{83766}I had to ask him|to hurry up, actually.
{83768}{83799}- Ow!|- Yeah.
{83802}{83903}He did admit to masturbating like crazy|beforehand so he wouldn't just--
{83906}{83983}- Like he wasn't doing that already.|- No, he sounds like a nice guy.
{83986}{84040}- He sounds like a dream come true.|- He was a nice guy.
{84043}{84101}He's a cop now.|He's got four kids.
{84103}{84162}Early sex|is an absolute humiliation.
{84164}{84259}Oh. Speak foryourself.|My first time was wonderful.
{84262}{84302}Oh, yeah?.
{84305}{84352}Let me take a wild guess.
{84381}{84434}- An older gentleman.|- Right you are.
{84436}{84471}- Married?.|- Right again.
{84500}{84535}How old were you?.
{84537}{84595}I was 1 9.|Freshman in college.
{84597}{84664}Guess you didn't spend a lot of time|getting to know your roommates.
{84667}{84759}No. No, I don't even remember|what they look like.
{84786}{84829}So what happened?.
{84861}{84953}Well, believe it or not,|he ended up staying with his wife.
{84979}{85017}What are the odds?.
{85019}{85067}What did you do when you realized|he wasn't going to leave her?.
{85069}{85146}Well, Nick,|I got over it eventually...
{85149}{85196}and vowed|not to repeat the mistake.
{85199}{85271}- And how's that going?.|- Some months are better than others.
{85274}{85308}- Uh-huh.|- Sophie--
{85311}{85364}- I didn't say anything.|- What can I do?. They're all married.
{85367}{85418}I promised I would not be a nag.|It's okay.
{85421}{85475}You, hotshot.|Tell us about your first time.
{85548}{85639}Actually, I think Nick's story|is much more interesting. Nick?.
{85663}{85719}- This I want to hear.|- Yeah.
{85781}{85822}Nicholas?.
{85825}{85900}Well, this is hard to admit, but...
{85941}{86004}I've never had sex.
{86118}{86161}You're a virgin?.
{86191}{86220}Yes.
{86335}{86391}That is so sexy.|Am I right?.
{86393}{86439}- It's hot.|- Really?.
{86441}{86481}- Yeah.|- Do you have a girlfriend?.
{86483}{86546}- No. Never.|- Have you ever kissed a girl?.
{86548}{86618}Yeah, a couple of times in junior high|playing truth or dare...
{86620}{86682}but they weren't like real kisses.
{86685}{86717}No tongue?.
{86735}{86811}I guess, but more than that.|They were just stiff.
{86814}{86859}Not like I imagined|that they should be.
{86862}{86917}Nick, come here for a second.
{87007}{87047}Oh, my God.
{87603}{87657}Now, don't fall in love with me|or anything, okay?.
{87702}{87754}That was just to get you|through junioryear.
{87756}{87795}All right.
{87875}{87923}I couldn't resist|being your first kiss.
{87926}{87955}That's right.
{87958}{88036}Forever and ever,|you will be his first kiss.
{88057}{88107}- Get away from me.|- Come on. For symmetry.
{88110}{88157}No, not a chance. Nick.
{88176}{88242}- How do you feel?.|- My heart is beating really fast.
{88245}{88304}- He knows just what to say.|- Is he a good kisser?.
{88307}{88375}Oh, he's gonna break some hearts.
{88395}{88436}How 'bout down below, Nick?.
{88439}{88490}Any, you know,|vertical displacement?.
{88493}{88557}Leave him alone.|How you doing, Casanova?.
{88559}{88598}- I'm okay.|- Sure?.
{88601}{88640}- Yeah.|- Okay.
{88643}{88723}Look, I confess. I'm married.|I keep my ring in my wallet.
{88726}{88773}Even ifyou were married.
{88884}{88919}Yeah, yeah.
{88986}{89011}So, Nick.
{89014}{89092}Take a moment to file this away|for later. You understand what I mean?.
{89123}{89148}Just think, Sophie.
{89171}{89252}In the next six months, every time|Nick jerks off, he'll be picturing you.
{89255}{89299}- Don't be an asshole.|- I don't do that, okay?.
{89302}{89359}It's true.|Okay, so I'm not married.
{89362}{89411}What's important is|the emotional unavailability, right?.
{89414}{89461}- That's what you look for.|- I'm leaving.
{89515}{89575}And, Sophie, you've even provided|young Nicholas here...
{89577}{89649}with a particular image|to help structure his fantasy.
{89679}{89724}Fuckyou, Roger.|Do you have a place to stay tonight?.
{89727}{89785}- He's staying with me.|- You can come with us.
{89787}{89875}He's with me. Unless you're finally|ready to do something constructive.
{89878}{89935}Like help Nick have an orgasm,|huh, Sophie?.
{89938}{90012}- It's time to cut your uncle loose.|- You're disgusting. We're outta here.
{90015}{90050}- You take care.|- Andrea?.
{90053}{90090}- Oh, disgusting.|- Fuckyou.
{90093}{90137}Ladies?. I--
{90155}{90200}Was it something he said?.
{90203}{90235}Asshole!
{90263}{90331}But no. Don't I--|Okay, here's your chance.
{90334}{90379}What are you talking about?.|Why did you say that?.
{90382}{90422}Good cop, bad cop.
{90425}{90483}I planted the seed.|Now go and close the deal, all right?.
{90486}{90534}- I can't go--|- You thinkyou'll get a better chance?.
{90536}{90592}Go, for Christ's sake,|and remember the primary objective.
{90595}{90629}Go, go, go!
{90887}{90935}Run, Nick, run.
{91123}{91155}Sophie!
{91188}{91269}Hey, Sophie. I'm sorry.
{91294}{91351}Don't worry about it.|It's not your fault he's a jerk.
{91354}{91438}I know. I wish it didn't|have to just end like this.
{91474}{91513}We're going now.
{91534}{91591}I suggest you|call offyour bet and go home.
{91610}{91660}The bet thing|was just bullshit, okay?.
{91700}{91731}I know.
{91782}{91825}You take it easy, okay?.
{91827}{91888}Look, I want us to--
{91925}{91985}Don't spoil the wonderful time|we had tonight.
{92007}{92046}You know?.
{92197}{92244}This is to remember me by.
{92471}{92517}Take care, Nick.
{92519}{92567}We need more men like you.
{93192}{93229}Hey.
{93231}{93257}What happened?.
{93259}{93302}What?. Nothing happened.
{93327}{93352}So you're oh for one.
{93355}{93402}She wasn't gonna go for it.|I couldn't ask her.
{93405}{93470}- You gonna sleep with Sophie tonight?.|- It was obvious. She was not--
{93472}{93540}Are you going to have sex|with Sophie tonight?.
{93615}{93675}- No.|- Then I repeat: you're oh for one.
{93677}{93753}You need to learn how to finish.|Anyone can get halay home.
{93847}{93900}We're switching to plan B. Hey!
{93943}{94006}I think a change ofvenue|will improve your luck.
{94462}{94510}Wait! Hold up! Stop!
{95570}{95630}Do me a favor.|Stay here till we're inside.
{95632}{95679}- So where we goin'?.|- Finish up.
{95750}{95824}- We're going to a party. Come on.|- Whose party is it?.
{95881}{95941}Fuck! Over here.|Over here.
{95975}{96026}Look at this.|Beautiful glasswork.
{96391}{96424}Whoa, whoa.
{96519}{96550}Why we running?.
{96553}{96599}That doorman has|a hateful personality.
{96601}{96665}Listen up. It's gonna be|a whole new dynamic up there.
{96667}{96697}Stay focused.
{96699}{96761}Don't talk to any guys.|That's a definite rally-killer.
{96763}{96831}Keep moving at all times.|No hiding in the bathroom.
{96850}{96898}Here we are. Hey.
{96981}{97033}- Look who it is.|- Hey, Chris. How are you?.
{97035}{97081}This is my nephew Nick.|Chris.
{97083}{97134}- How are you?.|- How ya doin'?.
{97257}{97329}Wait. Do you have|a bathroom I could use?.
{97331}{97379}- A what?.|- A bathroom I could use?.
{97381}{97406}A what?.
{97429}{97476}I've been trying to shake|this woman all night.
{97523}{97559}This is Donovan.
{97561}{97619}I'm the only one here|that's my age.
{97622}{97677}Where did you think we were going,|the junior prom?.
{97709}{97746}I think I'm drunk.
{97807}{97834}Come here.
{97899}{97955}Nick. Do you know|where we are?.
{97986}{98050}- I thinkyou said Greenwich Street.|- We're in winning time.
{98053}{98109}- Okay. Winning time.|- Right. Okay?.
{98111}{98173}It's a little harder to recognize|than when you're in a bar...
{98175}{98223}but the concept is the same.
{98266}{98320}There's an incredible moment|that happens when a party...
{98323}{98395}passes its apex, its peak.
{98421}{98494}As if by magic,|suddenly every person in the room...
{98497}{98544}is acutely aware of the time.
{98547}{98622}It is at that moment|that the fear hits.
{98647}{98721}- What fear?.|- The fear of the empty apartment.
{98746}{98774}Oh. Yeah.
{98777}{98830}That is more|than most people can stand.
{98853}{98930}Desperation creeps into the room|like a fog.
{98933}{99001}Eyes begin|to search the crowd anxiously.
{99003}{99083}Standards are drastically lowered.|I mean, it's palpable.
{99105}{99156}- You know what I'm saying?.|- Not really.
{99234}{99317}What I'm saying is,|you have a real shot here, Nick.
{99395}{99486}This is the moment|that separates a true champion.
{99488}{99539}You remember the reason|you first asked for my help?.
{99559}{99589}The primary goal?.
{99591}{99639}- Yes.|- Then let me help you...
{99641}{99684}to achieve it.
{99967}{100021}All right. So.
{100023}{100096}We need to scope out|who the drinkers are.
{100099}{100167}Every party needs a pace car,|a rabbit.
{100192}{100267}Always look for the girls who are|two drinks ahead of everybody else.
{100270}{100307}How do you do that?.
{100310}{100367}Listen for inappropriately loud|bursts of laughter...
{100370}{100423}or scan the crowd|for somebody spilling a drink.
{100426}{100514}Check the dance floor for somebody|working out of their zone.
{100517}{100564}How about them?.|They seem pretty drunk.
{100663}{100694}Good afternoon.
{100731}{100825}God, this is so embarrassing.|I don't know how this happened.
{100827}{100890}I'm so sorry.|I'm sorry.
{100893}{100924}Hey, Donna.
{100959}{101002}- Hi.|- How ya doin'?.
{101004}{101043}- Well--|- Good. Listen.
{101046}{101091}This is my nephew|I want to introduce. Nick.
{101094}{101144}- Hi.|- I saw you earlier at the office.
{101147}{101197}Hi, Nick. Donna.
{101199}{101259}- Nice to see you.|- You too.
{101305}{101368}- Roger's showing you the town?.|- Yeah, some of it.
{101389}{101425}Yeah, Nick's visiting.
{101427}{101482}Why don't you tell Donna|about the bet we got going.
{101485}{101524}- See you in a second.|- Huh?. Wait.
{101545}{101626}What bet?.|What's he got you involved in?.
{101628}{101687}- Oh, it's nothing. Really.|- What is this?.
{101689}{101735}Oh, that. I don't even know.
{101738}{101769}- It's cute.|- Thanks.
{101771}{101814}I don't even use it.
{101817}{101875}Eighty. Hot. Eighty degrees.
{101878}{101930}That is hot. Yeah.
{101991}{102095}We made a bet whether I can get|someone to fall in love with me tonight.
{102098}{102129}Wow.
{102146}{102203}- For how much?.|- A thousand bucks.
{102243}{102282}Get outta here.
{102317}{102364}Well, so, how's it going so far?.
{102410}{102459}Excuse me.|Thank you.
{102484}{102530}Thankyou. Cheers.
{102532}{102561}Yeah.
{102587}{102629}To love.
{102951}{102998}Oh, hello.
{103001}{103090}You're not the infamous Roger Swanson|I've heard so much about, are you?.
{103092}{103122}That's me. Yes.
{103124}{103212}Joyce says of all of her copy people,|you are the funniest.
{103215}{103260}- I'm a laugh riot.|- No, she says that.
{103263}{103317}- Why would I lie?.|- What's your name?.
{103319}{103370}I'm sorry.|I haven't introduced myself.
{103373}{103443}I'm Patricia.Joyce and I|went to college together.
{103445}{103495}Nice to meet you.|Patty, would you do me a favor?.
{103498}{103549}Sure. I can certainly try.
{103551}{103623}See that kid right over there|in the corner?.
{103625}{103672}- Yeah.|- That's my nephew Nick.
{103675}{103720}- Oh, really. He's so cute.|- He is.
{103723}{103774}- He's still a virgin.|- No!
{103776}{103837}- Swear to God.|- Poor boy. How old is he?.
{103839}{103875}He's 1 6. Now, listen.
{103878}{103947}My time with Joyce taught me that|older women fuck like jackrabbits...
{103950}{104022}and Nick is at|his absolute peak sexually.
{104024}{104070}So, I figure,|the two ofyou go at it...
{104072}{104118}it would be|like Frazier and Ali.
{104120}{104162}- Right?.|- Something is wrong with you.
{104164}{104231}No, I'm serious.|What do you say?.
{104234}{104309}- As a kind of a...|- I'm gonna--
{104311}{104354}Red Cross moment or--
{104357}{104406}Okay. Nice to see you.
{104812}{104898}- How's it goin' over here?.|- Hey, Roger.
{104901}{104974}- Now, who let you in?.|- Who let me in?. You let me in.
{104977}{105008}What?.
{105027}{105082}You know, Nick here|is a real ladies' man.
{105084}{105131}You're luc he's spending|all this time with you.
{105134}{105188}Yeah, that's me.|The luc lady.
{105240}{105325}Actually... I think|I had too much to drink.
{105327}{105378}- Uh-oh.|- Would you like to lie down?.
{105381}{105434}Nick, Nick.|Excellent idea.
{105436}{105500}Good one. Come on, darling.|Let's find you a place to lie down.
{105503}{105548}Oh, no.Just when things|were getting good.
{105551}{105598}Things are still good.
{105710}{105758}- Come on.|- Where are we going?.
{105761}{105807}- We're going.|- We are?.
{105809}{105875}We're going right around|this little corner.
{105878}{105925}- Here we go.|- I forgot to eat.
{106046}{106098}Nick, stay with us.|Keep close.
{106100}{106134}- Okay.|- Good.
{106136}{106199}- All right. So I'll just--|- Oh, excellent.
{106230}{106283}- Are you all right?.|- I'll just leave you two together.
{106286}{106321}- Okay.|- No, don't go.
{106324}{106384}- You're in capable hands, believe me.|- What are you doing?.
{106387}{106423}Hang on a second.
{106704}{106751}What are we gonna do?.
{106754}{106847}We are not gonna do anything...|at all.
{107043}{107091}I'll be on guard duty, okay?.
{107137}{107215}You need to work fast. If I were you,|I'd switch to the two-minute offense.
{107218}{107272}What are you talking about?.|Wait, Uncle Roger--
{107282}{107313}Love you.
{107409}{107444}Don't go.
{107767}{107802}Oh, let me introduce you.
{107804}{107851}This is Donovan Lehman,|Christopher Weland...
{107854}{107895}our two collaborators.
{107898}{107943}I think they're gonna be|perfect foryou.
{107946}{108020}You told me you wanted something|a little bit magic, a bit surreal.
{108023}{108083}Hey, hey, Donovan.|How are you, man?.
{108086}{108142}- Roger. Hey, man.|- How are you?.
{108144}{108175}Hey, Chris.
{108206}{108235}Look at you two.
{108238}{108319}You seem like the happy couple.|What's your secret?.
{108321}{108382}Sorry. You know what they say about|dipping the pen in the company ink.
{108419}{108499}- I guess so.|- I know what they say. Yes, they do.
{108554}{108585}All right.
{109016}{109051}Look at you.
{112286}{112321}Go to sleep.
{113122}{113163}I think we got sidetracked there.
{113166}{113219}Seriously, Donovan, with all|the pressure facing men today...
{113222}{113270}it's got to be tough|to maintain a relationship.
{113273}{113319}I don't know.|Let's ask a man. Chris?.
{113321}{113369}Traditional male roles|are being tossed aside...
{113371}{113434}before we have any chance to make|an internal shift, don't you think?.
{113437}{113522}Our culture seems designed|to emasculate and infantilize.
{113547}{113598}- That's a strong statement.|- Why don't you go and...
{113601}{113640}help yourself to some food?.
{113643}{113698}It's particularly true|in a situation when the woman is...
{113700}{113757}two decades older than the man.
{113780}{113836}- Roger!|- Approximately.
{113917}{113964}We were having|this discussion the other day--
{113967}{114027}Is it your mission in life|to humiliate yourself?.
{114030}{114079}It's more of a hobby really.
{114082}{114130}I want you to leave right now.
{114133}{114183}You want me to leave|and go where?.
{114208}{114274}Think very hard|about what you're doing.
{114277}{114330}Go where,Joyce?.|Where do you want me to go?.
{114406}{114435}You're through.
{114438}{114495}You lied to me.|You are a liar.
{114498}{114548}- I want you to leave.|- Who's he?.
{114551}{114593}Who the fuck is he?.
{114595}{114637}Who the fuck is he?.
{114639}{114688}Who is he?. What--
{114770}{114801}Don't get comfortable.
{114838}{114909}Don't ever settle in|like you own the place. Trust me.
{114950}{114997}There's always something|gaining on you.
{115018}{115094}And here they come now.|Hey, guys. Good luck.
{115097}{115140}Sorry. Take care now.
{115168}{115242}Let me get a coat here.|Take care.
{115244}{115303}Nice to see you.|Thanks, Joyce! Bye-bye!
{115347}{115383}What just happened?.
{115385}{115432}Excuse me. I'm sorry.
{115762}{115811}That didn't go|exactly as I had hoped.
{115934}{115986}What happened in there?.|What were you shouting about?.
{115988}{116035}Doesn't matter.|What about you?.
{116038}{116083}- Did you get it on with Donna?.|- No.
{116086}{116154}- Why not?.|- Are you kidding?. She was passed out!
{116156}{116274}Nick, you have had one golden|opportunity after another this evening.
{116276}{116337}You haven't exactly shown yourself|to be a clutch player.
{116339}{116387}- Hey!|- What happened in there?.
{116389}{116445}- Are you drunk?.|- I'm going home.
{116447}{116505}- Where do you need to be dropped?.|- What?.
{116507}{116538}That's it?.
{116565}{116636}We've had a full evening.|I thinkyou're ready to fly solo.
{116693}{116756}- You said there was a fail-safe.|- What fail-safe?.
{116779}{116829}Back at the bar.|You said there was a fail-safe.
{116831}{116858}Did I?.
{116903}{116989}- I don't thinkyou want the fail-safe.|- No, I want it! Just stop.
{116991}{117033}- You sure?.|- Yes, I'm sure.
{117035}{117091}I'm not going home like this,|all right?.
{117094}{117126}I'm sure. Okay?.
{117183}{117229}You know what?. You're right.
{117231}{117306}Why give into a slump?.|Let's go down swinging.
{117309}{117368}- Yes. Like Michael Jordan.|- Right.
{117371}{117442}That's the wrong sport,|but I like your enthusiasm. Let's go.
{118218}{118253}All right. Thanks.
{118673}{118710}Come on. Come on.
{120044}{120098}Hey. Two of us.
{120101}{120137}That's 200.
{120254}{120292}One... two.
{120356}{120415}- Is he a minor?.|- I'm an actor. I'm researching a role.
{122244}{122287}It's a hundred to fuck me.
{122721}{122750}Tip.
{123262}{123287}Come on.

{133325}{133379}I'm sorry I got so mad.
{133414}{133449}You're what?.
{133489}{133520}Last night.
{133590}{133662}You were trying to teach me|the way that things are done, and I--
{133701}{133771}I guess I kept fucking it up. So--
{133773}{133827}So I shouldn't have gotten so mad.

{138256}{138295}I swear to God.

{138391}{138418}Fuck 'em up.
{138421}{138468}So go tell her, Nick.
{138471}{138500}What?.
{138539}{138572}Go tell her.
{138575}{138617}Yeah, maybe she doesn't know.
{138619}{138684}- You know, you'd be doing her a favor.|- Yeah.
{138687}{138723}A true favor.
{138726}{138757}Yeah.
{139462}{139509}Look who dropped by|for a visit.
{139602}{139637}Girls.
{139669}{139702}Young women.
{139769}{139827}Female human beings.
{139882}{139938}Female hearts|beating beneath...
{139941}{139982}those tight sweaters.
{139985}{140063}Feminine blood|coursing through theirveins.
{140066}{140152}Living, breathing girls.
{140199}{140270}What are you young men in the|prime ofyour lives doing about this?.
{140272}{140314}I'm doing plenty.
{140317}{140365}- Yeah?. You're getting plenty of action?.|- Oh, yeah.
{140367}{140408}He has to beat 'em off|with a stick.
{140411}{140525}Unfortunately, I'm not talking about|"whack-off.com," okay?.
{140527}{140592}I'm talking about|the girls in this room.
{140595}{140643}I'm talking about communicating.
{140646}{140683}I'm talking about engaging.
{140686}{140746}I'm talking about|standing up from this...
{140786}{140886}guys-only, StarTrek-convention,|frankly, homoerotic little group...
{140916}{140973}and introducing yourself|to one of these girls.
{140975}{141021}Yeah, but I always get so nervous.
{141023}{141078}Why?. There's nothing at stake.
{141080}{141131}If there was a chance ofyou|actually getting laid...
{141134}{141175}then you'd have|a reason to be nervous.
{141178}{141223}Try working someone in a bar|for three hours...
{141226}{141301}and then you gotta close the deal|right before last call.
{141303}{141351}That's pressure. Okay?.
{141371}{141429}You guys can treat this|like it's a warm-up.
{141454}{141522}You're trying to find your style.|So you get nervous?.
{141524}{141595}Maybe you're the nervous guy.|Maybe that's your hook.
{141598}{141665}So go ahead and blush.|Stutter all you want.
{141684}{141738}Show her|how she makes you feel.
{141740}{141793}Think of it. You're combining|honesty and flattery.
{141795}{141839}- That's lethal.|- Yeah, but...
{141842}{141901}you can't let a girl know|how nervous you are.
{141903}{141957}You gotta let her know|you're in control, right?.
{142008}{142050}"In control"?.|Who is this guy?.
{142052}{142109}You're in high school. You don't|control any-- Look at your face.
{142111}{142162}Look at what you're eating,|for Christ's sake.
{142164}{142209}Look at that shirt.
{142211}{142246}In control.
{142266}{142306}All right.
{142308}{142355}Who's the one you guys|are all desperate to talk to?.
{142358}{142382}Angela.
{142407}{142431}Definitely.
{142485}{142553}- Angela.|- Okay. Here's what you could say.
{142613}{142666}Hi, Angela.|My name is-- What is it?.
{142668}{142717}- Darren.|- My name is Darren.
{142777}{142849}Every time I see you in the hall,|I have the urge to talk to you.
{142866}{142920}So I try to think|of something clever to say...
{142923}{142975}but I get so nervous...
{143022}{143078}that nothing comes out.
{143081}{143158}We don't know each other right now,|but I'd like to maybe...
{143175}{143247}invite you out for a soda sometime|so that we could talk.
{143250}{143297}I'd like to see|what we have in common.
{143321}{143373}But most of all,|I'm curious to find out...
{143375}{143423}what kind of person|you really are...
{143425}{143489}because I am tired|of looking at you from a dist--
{143491}{143537}And so on and so forth.
{143539}{143585}Take that out for a spin.|See how it works.
{143587}{143649}Yeah. See her turn around|and walk back to the jock table.
{143651}{143689}- Yeah.|- If that happens...
{143691}{143739}you go to sleep|knowing you gave it your best shot.
{143741}{143786}Remember, she has to|show you something as well.
{143812}{143862}I'd love it|if Angela showed me something.
{143895}{143956}- Yeah. Two things.|- Yeah!
{143990}{144025}I'd lick 'em.
{144074}{144138}Well, I tried.|Hang in there, Nick.
{144141}{144171}Wait. You're going?.
{144174}{144236}Yeah, I gotta get home,|look forwork.
{144239}{144284}As we speak,|consumers everywhere need reminding...
{144287}{144333}of just how fat|and unattractive they are.
{144374}{144421}Nice meeting you, men.
{144438}{144477}Keep your sense of humor.
{144494}{144577}In ten years, you won't even remember|what this place looks like. Trust me.
{144687}{144735}Dude, your uncle is strange.
{144755}{144800}Yeah, I know.|I guess he is.
{144803}{144847}Yeah, but he's cool.|You gonna visit him again?.
{144926}{144957}I don't know.
{145055}{145086}What?.
{145167}{145196}What?.
{145259}{145294}Hey, Nick.
{145297}{145352}Some guy, I guess|he's your uncle...
{145355}{145409}he said you had|something to tell me.
{145479}{145547}He said it would|"blow my mind."
