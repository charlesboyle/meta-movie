00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:22,613
Shit!

3
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,137
Andrew, hey.

4
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,634
Here you go. Your regular lattes.

5
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:55,876
Literally saved my life.
Thank you. Thank you.

6
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,588
- Everyone OK?
- Yeah.

7
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,895
- Yeah.
- Me too.

8
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,634
Hello, Frank? How's my favorite writer?

9
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,332
Of course you've been
thinking about our talk

10
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,034
because you know I'm right.

11
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,975
Frank, people in this
country are busy, broke,

12
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,103
and they hate to read.
They need someone they can trust to say,

13
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,478
<i>"Hey! Don't watch
CSl: Indianapolis tonight.</i>

14
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,916
Read a book! Read Frank's book. "
And that person is Oprah.

15
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,986
- Cuttin' it close.
- One of those mornings.

16
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,515
Thank you, Captain Obvious.

17
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,824
Sweet...

18
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,523
- Uh, sorry.
... Jesus!

19
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,464
Rub some dirt on it, brother.

20
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,957
Frank, the truth is all
A- plus novelists do publicity.

21
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,702
Roth, McCourt, Russo, and...

22
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,641
Frank! Can I tell you what else
they have in common? A Pulitzer.

23
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,277
I need the shirt off
your back. Literally.

24
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,770
- You're kidding, right?
- Yankees, Boston, this Tuesday,

25
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:05,215
two company seats for your shirt.
You have five seconds to decide.

26
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,912
Five, four, three, two, one.

27
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,443
I know...

28
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,752
- Shh!
- Later.

29
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,826
Uh-oh.

30
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,697
Uh, hello. Hello?

31
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,314
Morning, boss. You have a
conference call in 30 minutes.

32
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,317
Yes. About the marketing
of the spring books. I know.

33
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,716
Staff meeting at 9:00.

34
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,310
Did you call, um...
What's her name?

35
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,788
The one with the ugly hands.

36
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:44,847
- Janet.
- Yes, Janet.

37
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,290
Yes. I did call her. I told her that

38
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,021
if she doesn't get her
manuscript in on time

39
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,461
you won't give her a release date.
Your immigration lawyer called.

40
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:51,622
He said it's imperative...

41
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,325
Cancel the call, push
the meeting to tomorrow

42
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,799
and keep the lawyer on the sheets.

43
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,301
Oh, and get a hold of PR,

44
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,769
have them start drafting
a press release.

45
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,271
<i>Frank is doing Oprah.</i>

46
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,830
Wow. Nicely done.

47
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:05,071
If I want your praise,
I will ask for it.

48
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,080
Um...

49
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,776
Who is, uh, who is Jillian?

50
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,513
And why does she want me to call her?

51
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,657
Well, that was originally my cup.

52
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,659
And I'm drinking your coffee why?

53
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,718
Because your coffee spilled.

54
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:32,235
So, you drink unsweetened
cinnamon light soy lattes?

55
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,332
I do. It's like Christmas in a cup.

56
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,808
Is that a coincidence?

57
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,243
Incredibly, it is.

58
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,440
I mean I wouldn't possibly drink
the same coffee that you drink

59
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,108
just in case yours spilled.

60
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,946
That would be pathetic.

61
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,009
Morning. Miss Tate's office.

62
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,350
Hey, Bob.

63
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:53,254
Actually, we're headed to
your office right now. Yeah.

64
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,057
Why are we headed to Bob's office?

65
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,565
Oop!

66
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,570
Have you finished the
manuscript I gave you?

67
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:16,173
Uh, I read a few pages.
I wasn't that impressed.

68
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,580
- Can I say something?
- No.

69
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,676
I've read thousands of manuscripts,

70
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,118
and this is the only one
I've given you.

71
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,883
There's an incredible novel in there.

72
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,822
The kind of novel you used to publish.

73
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:28,156
Uh, wrong. And I do think you
order the same coffee as I do

74
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,685
just in case you spill,
which is, in fact, pathetic.

75
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,992
- Or impressive.
- I'd be impressed

76
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,259
if you didn't spill in the first place.

77
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,732
Now remember, you're
just a prop in here.

78
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,735
Won't say a word.

79
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:44,142
Ah! Our fearless leader and
her liege. Please, do come in.

80
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,806
Oh. Beautiful breakfront. Is it new?

81
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,873
It is English Regency Egyptian
Revival, built in the 1800s

82
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,750
but, yes, it is new to my office.

83
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,413
Witty.

84
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,083
Bob, I'm letting you go.

85
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,718
Pardon?

86
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,856
<i>I asked you over a dozen times to get
Frank to do Oprah, and you didn't do it.</i>

87
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,991
You're fired.

88
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,564
I have told you that is impossible.

89
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,004
Frank hasn't done an
interview in 20 years.

90
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,735
Well that is
interesting, because I just

91
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,266
got off the phone
with him, and he is in.

92
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,944
Excuse me?

93
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,379
You didn't even call him, did you?

94
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,512
- But...
- I know, I know.

95
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,782
Frank can be a little scary
to deal with. For you.

96
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:32,052
Now, I will give you two
months to find another job.

97
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,559
And then you can tell
everyone you resigned, OK?

98
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,724
What's his twenty?

99
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:44,430
<i>He's moving. He has crazy eyes.</i>

100
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,563
Don't do it, Bob. Don't do it.

101
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:50,599
You poisonous bitch!

102
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,304
You can't fire me!

103
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,643
You don't think I see
what you're doing here?

104
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,443
Sandbagging me on this Oprah thing

105
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,382
just so that you can
look good to the board?

106
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,410
Because you are threatened by me!

107
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,321
- And you are a monster.
- Bob, stop.

108
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,656
Just because you have
no semblance of a life

109
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,456
outside of this office,

110
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,622
you think that you can treat all of us

111
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,325
like your own personal slaves.

112
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,926
You know what? I feel sorry for you.

113
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,698
Because you know what you're
gonna have on your deathbed?

114
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,763
Nothing and no one.

115
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,169
Listen carefully, Bob.

116
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,808
I didn't fire you because
I feel threatened. No.

117
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,251
<i>I fired you because you're
lazy, entitled, incompetent</i>

118
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,948
and you spend more time
cheating on your wife

119
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,319
than you do in your office.

120
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:38,687
And if you say another word,

121
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,022
Andrew here is gonna have you
thrown out on your ass, OK?

122
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,585
Another word and you're
going out of here

123
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,891
with an armed escort.

124
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,796
Andrew will film it with
his little camera phone

125
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,460
and he will put it
on that Internet site.

126
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,729
- What was it?
- YouTube?

127
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,203
Exactly. Is that what you want?

128
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,865
Didn't think so. I have work to do.

129
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,234
Have security take his
breakfront out of his office

130
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,403
and put it in my conference room.

131
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:00,469
Will do.

132
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,605
And I need you around this weekend

133
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,012
to help review his files
and his manuscript.

134
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,643
- This weekend?
- You have a problem with that?

135
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,710
No. I... just my
grandmother's 90th birthday,

136
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,152
so I was gonna go home and...

137
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,985
...it's fine. I'll cancel it.

138
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,957
You're actually saving me from
a weekend of misery anyway,

139
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,290
so it's... good talk, yeah.

140
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:20,425
I know, I know. OK, tell
Gammy I'm sorry. OK? What...

141
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,024
Mom. What do you want me to tell you?

142
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,502
She's making me work the weekend.

143
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,834
No, I'm not... no.

144
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,430
Listen, I've worked too
hard for this promotion

145
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:28,565
to throw it all away, OK?

146
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,098
I'm sure that Dad is pissed,

147
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:33,043
but we take all of our submissions
around here very seriously.

148
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,480
We'll get back to
you as soon as we can.

149
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,507
- Was that your family?
- Yes.

150
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,280
- They tell you to quit?
- Every single day.

151
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,516
Miss Tate's office.

152
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,252
Oh... Yeah. OK. All right.

153
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,385
Bergen and Malloy want to
see you upstairs immediately.

154
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:51,021
OK. Come get me in ten
minutes. We've got a lot to do.

155
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,087
Okey-doke.

156
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,432
Good morning, Miss Tate.

157
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,666
Jack, Edwin.

158
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,472
<i>Margaret, congratulations
on the Oprah thing.</i>

159
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,376
- That's terrific news.
- Thank you, thank you.

160
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:10,280
This isn't about my second raise, is it?
Just kidding.

161
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,945
Margaret, do you
remember when we agreed

162
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,011
that you wouldn't go to
the Frankfurt Book Fair

163
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,454
because you weren't allowed
out of the country

164
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,390
while your visa application
was being processed?

165
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,449
Yes. I do.

166
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,859
And... you went to Frankfurt.

167
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,090
Yes, I did. We were going
to lose DeLillo to Viking.

168
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,156
So... really didn't
have a choice, did I?

169
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,564
It seems that the
United States Government

170
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,626
doesn't care much who
publishes Don DeLillo.

171
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,434
We, uh, just spoke to
your immigration attorney.

172
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:36,100
Great. So, we're all good?
Everything good?

173
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,610
Margaret, your visa application
has been denied.

174
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,807
And you are being deported.

175
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:42,973
Deported?

176
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,710
And apparently there
was also some paperwork

177
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,115
that you didn't fill out in time.

178
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:50,612
Come on. Come on! It's not
like I'm even an immigrant!

179
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,647
I'm from Canada, for Christ's sake.

180
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,058
There's gotta be... there's
gotta be something we can do.

181
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,062
We can reapply, but unfortunately

182
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,088
you have to leave the country
for at least a year.

183
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:07,037
OK. OK, well, that's
not ideal, but, uh...

184
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,870
I can, uh... I can manage
everything from Toronto...

185
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,068
No, Margaret.

186
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,406
...with videoconferencing
and Internet.

187
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,570
Unfortunately, Margaret,

188
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,308
if you're deported,
you can't work for an American company.

189
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,748
Until this is resolved I'm going
to turn operations over

190
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,977
to Bob Spaulding.

191
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,680
Bob Spaulding? The guy I just fired?

192
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,120
We need an editor in chief.

193
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,521
He is the only person in the building
who has enough experience.

194
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,389
- You cannot be serious. I beg of you.
- Margaret.

195
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,394
We are desperate to have you stay.

196
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,397
If there was any way, any way at all

197
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,989
that we could make this work,
we'd be doing it.

198
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,159
There is no way...

199
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,225
I am begging you.

200
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,895
No, Margaret. Excuse me,
we're in a meeting.

201
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,495
- Sorry to interrupt.
- What? What!

202
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,098
Mary from Miss Winfrey's office
called. She's on the line.

203
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,199
- I know.
- She's on hold.

204
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:46,177
She needs to speak with you right away.
I told her you were otherwise engaged.

205
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,772
She insisted, so... sorry.

206
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,441
So...

207
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,451
Uh...

208
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,096
Come here.

209
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:11,299
Uh... Gentlemen, I understand.
I understand...

210
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,431
the predicament that we are in.

211
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,134
And, um...

212
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:20,240
And there's, uh... well...

213
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,907
I think there's something
that you should know.

214
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,651
Uh... we're, uh...
we're getting married.

215
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,780
We are getting married.

216
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,449
- Who is getting married?
- You and I.

217
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,254
You and I are getting married! Yes.

218
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,954
- We are.
- Getting married.

219
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,428
- We are getting married.
- Yes.

220
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,291
Isn't he your secretary?

221
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,391
Assistant.

222
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:46,166
Executive, uh...
assistant secretary. Titles.

223
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:50,471
But, wouldn't be the first time
one of us fell for our secretaries.

224
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,500
Would it, Edwin?

225
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,775
With Laquisha. Remember?

226
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:58,341
So, yeah... The truth is,

227
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,514
you know, Andrew and I, we're...
we are just two people

228
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,716
who weren't meant to
fall in love but we did.

229
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,088
No.

230
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:11,153
All those late nights at the
office and weekend book fairs.

231
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,255
- Yeah...
- No.

232
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,960
- Something happened.
- Something.

233
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,128
Yeah. Tried to fight it and...

234
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,797
Can't, can't fight a...

235
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,299
Can't fight a love like ours, so, uh...

236
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,744
Uh... Are we good with this?
Are you happy?

237
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,648
Because, well... we are happy. So happy.

238
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,810
- Margaret.
- Yes?

239
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,752
It's terrific.

240
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,516
Just make it legal. Mmm?

241
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:39,183
Oh! Legal.

242
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:42,558
Yeah, well, then...
then that means we...

243
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,893
...we need to get ourselves
to the immigration office.

244
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,558
So we can work this
whole mess out. Right?

245
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,465
Thank you
very much, gentlemen.

246
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,560
We will do that right away.

247
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,798
Thank you very much,
gentlemen. Thank you.

248
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,068
- Gentlemen.
- Thank you.

249
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,745
Margaret
and Andrew are getting married!

250
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,076
What is that about?

251
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,172
Dragon Lady!
Here they come...

252
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,546
Yeah.

253
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,346
What is he thinking?

254
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,477
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

255
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:12,182
Dude, for real. Her?

256
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,488
Married? Didn't
even know they were dating...

257
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:37,472
What?

258
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,751
I don't understand what's happening.

259
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,754
Relax. This is for you, too.

260
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,119
Do explain.

261
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,386
They were going to make Bob chief.

262
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,086
So naturally I would have to marry you.

263
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,719
And what's the problem?

264
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:52,094
Like you were saving yourself
for someone special?

265
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:55,259
I like to think so.
Besides, it's illegal.

266
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,498
They're looking for terrorists,
not for book publishers.

267
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,061
- Margaret.
- Yes?

268
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:03,165
- I'm not gonna marry you.
- Sure you are.

269
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:06,235
Because if you don't marry me, your
dreams of touching the lives of millions

270
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,007
with the written word are dead.

271
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,478
Bob is gonna fire you the second
I'm gone. Guaranteed.

272
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,581
That means you're out on the street
alone looking for a job.

273
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,115
That means all the time that
we spent together, all the lattes,

274
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,355
all the canceled dates,
all the midnight Tampax runs,

275
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,694
were all for nothing and all your dreams
of being an editor are gone.

276
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,132
But don't worry, after the required
allotment of time,

277
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,635
we'll get a quickie divorce
and you'll be done with me.

278
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,500
But until then, like it or not,

279
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,472
your wagon is hitched to mine. OK?

280
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,701
Phone.

281
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,617
- This way.
- Margaret.

282
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,683
- Come.
- The line...

283
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,751
Next, please.

284
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,421
Ooh, ooh. Just, uh...

285
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,987
Sorry, I just need to ask him something.

286
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,829
I need for you to file this
fiancée visa for me, please.

287
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,872
- Miss Tate?
- Yes.

288
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,967
Please, come with me.

289
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,570
Yes, ma'am, I understand
that. We're backed up...

290
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,977
I have a bad feeling about this.

291
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,018
- Hi. Hello.
- Hello.

292
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,545
Hi. I'm Mr. Gilbertson.

293
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,649
- Ah!
- And you must be Andrew,

294
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,023
- and you must be...
- Margaret.

295
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,857
...Margaret. Sorry about the wait.

296
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,556
<i>It's a, uh, crazy day today.</i>

297
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,758
Oh, of course, of course. We understand.

298
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,824
And I can't tell you how much
we appreciate you seeing us

299
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:39,929
- on such short notice.
- OK.

300
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,463
<i># Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh
buh, buh, buh, buuuh</i>

301
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,339
So, I have one question for you.

302
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,573
Are you both committing fraud
to avoid her deportation

303
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,709
so she can keep her position
as editor in chief at Colden Books?

304
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,378
- That's ridiculous.
- Where did you hear that?

305
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,719
We had a phone tip this afternoon
from a man named...

306
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,519
Would it be Bob Spaulding?

307
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:00,889
Bob Spaulding.

308
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:04,225
Bob. Poor Bob. I am so sorry.

309
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:08,199
Bob is nothing but a disgruntled
former employee.

310
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,325
<i>And I apologize.</i>

311
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,064
But we know you're incredibly busy

312
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:15,972
with a room full of gardeners
and delivery boys to tend to.

313
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,566
If you just give us our next step,

314
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,634
we will be out of your
hair and on our way.

315
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,304
Miss Tate, please.

316
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,846
Let me explain to you the
process that's about to unfold.

317
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:31,287
Step one will be a scheduled interview.

318
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,850
I'll put you each in a room,
and I'll ask you every little question

319
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,861
that a real couple
would know about each other.

320
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:41,093
Step two, I dig deeper.
I look at your phone records,

321
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,465
I talk to your neighbors,
I interview your coworkers.

322
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,936
If your answers don't match up
at every point,

323
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,633
you will be deported indefinitely.

324
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,074
And you, young man,
will have committed a felony...

325
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,103
...punishable by a fine of $250,000

326
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:59,379
and a stay of five years
in federal prison.

327
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,719
So, Andrew.

328
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:09,159
You wanna... you want to talk to me?

329
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,795
No?

330
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,769
Yes?

331
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,740
The truth is...

332
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:32,580
Mr. Gilbertson, the truth is...

333
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,381
Margaret and I...

334
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,124
...are just two people

335
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,150
who weren't supposed to fall in love.

336
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,723
But did.

337
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,762
We couldn't tell anyone we work with

338
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,395
because of my big promotion
that I had coming up.

339
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,904
- Promotion?
- Yeah.

340
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:56,772
- Your?
- We... we both felt, uh...

341
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:00,939
...that it would be deeply inappropriate
if I were to be promoted to editor.

342
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,641
- Editor. Mmm-hmm.
... while we were...

343
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,710
So...

344
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,813
Have the two of you told your parents
about your secret love?

345
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:14,189
Oh, I... impossible.
My parents are dead.

346
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,490
- No brothers or sisters either.
- Gone.

347
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,826
Are your parents dead?

348
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,025
- Oh, no, his are very much alive.
- No... very much.

349
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:24,365
Very much. They're, ah... Well,
we were gonna tell them this weekend.

350
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:28,362
Gammy's 90th birthday, and the whole
family's coming together.

351
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,999
And we thought it'd be a nice surprise.

352
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,067
And where is this
surprise gonna take place?

353
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,204
At Andrew's parents' house.

354
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,372
Where is that located again?

355
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,042
Um...
Why am I doing all the talking?

356
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,448
It's your parents' house.

357
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:40,918
Why don't you tell him
where it is. Jump in.

358
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:45,084
- Sitka.
- Sitka.

359
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,149
- Alaska.
- Alaska?

360
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,285
You're gonna go to Alaska this weekend?

361
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,797
- Yeah.
- Yes, yes.

362
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:56,028
We are going to Alaska.
Alaska, that's where...

363
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,969
That's where my little...
that's where my Andrew's from.

364
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:01,837
OK.

365
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:05,332
Fine. I see how this is gonna go.

366
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,312
I will see you both
at 11:00 Monday morning

367
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,315
for your scheduled interview,

368
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,750
and your answers better
match up on every account.

369
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,352
- Thank you.
- Hello?

370
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,481
- I'm looking forward to this one.
- We're looking forward to this one.

371
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,582
Thank you.

372
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,389
Gonna be fun.
I'll be checking up on you.

373
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,451
You got it.

374
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:32,867
OK... so, what's gonna happen is
we will go up there.

375
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,930
We will pretend like we're
boyfriend and girlfriend,

376
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,565
tell your parents we're engaged.

377
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,200
Uh, use the miles for the tickets.

378
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,940
I guess I will pop for you to fly first
class. But make sure you use the miles.

379
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,311
If we don't get the miles,
we're not doing it.

380
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,282
Oh, and please confirm
the vegan meal, OK?

381
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,285
'Cause last time they actually
gave it to a vegan,

382
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,946
and they, uh... forced me to eat

383
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,478
this clammy, warm, creamy
salad thing, which was...

384
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,514
Hey, I'm... Why aren't you taking notes?

385
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,891
I'm sorry, were you not in that room?

386
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,293
What? What?

387
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,155
Oh! The thing you said about
being promoted?

388
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,191
Genius! Genius.
He completely fell for it.

389
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,497
I was serious.

390
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,437
I'm looking at a $250,000 fine
and five years in jail.

391
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:08,666
That changes things.

392
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:12,837
- Promote you to editor? No, no way.
- Then I quit, and you're screwed.

393
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,902
Bye-bye, Margaret.

394
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,413
- Andrew!
- It really has been

395
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,848
- a little slice of heaven.
- Andrew, Andrew! Fine, fine.

396
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:22,119
I'll make you editor. Fine.

397
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:25,749
If you do the Alaska weekend
and the immigration interview,

398
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,692
I will make you editor. Happy?

399
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,127
- And not in two years. Right away.
- Fine.

400
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,653
And you'll publish my manuscript.

401
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,864
Ten thousand copy first...

402
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,459
Twenty thousand copies, first run.

403
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,436
And we'll tell my family
about our engagement

404
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,098
when I want and how I want.

405
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,437
Now, ask me nicely.

406
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:44,635
"Ask you nicely" what?

407
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:48,442
Ask me nicely to marry you, Margaret.

408
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:53,508
- What does that mean?
- You heard me. On your knee.

409
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:03,685
Fine.

410
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,436
- Does this work for you?
- Oh, I like this. Yeah.

411
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,634
- Will you marry me?
- No.

412
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,233
Say it like you mean it.

413
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,247
- Andrew?
- Yes, Margaret?

414
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,377
- Sweet Andrew?
- I'm listening.

415
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,411
Would you please,
with cherries on top, marry me?

416
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,687
OK. I don't appreciate the sarcasm,
but I'll do it.

417
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,355
- See you at the airport tomorrow.
- Good.

418
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:54,768
So, these are the questions
that INS is gonna ask us.

419
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,805
Now, the good news is is
I know everything about you,

420
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,544
but the bad news is
that you have four days

421
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:04,385
to learn all this about me.
So, you should... probably get studying.

422
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,223
You know all the answers
to these questions about me?

423
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,287
- Scary, isn't it?
- A little bit.

424
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,731
- What am I allergic to?
- Pine nuts.

425
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,700
And the full spectrum of human emotion.

426
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,703
Oh, that's... that was funny.

427
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,534
- Mmm-hmm.
- Umm...

428
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:23,439
Here's a good one. Do I have any scars?

429
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,375
I'm pretty sure that you have a tattoo.

430
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,071
Oh, you're pretty sure?

431
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,478
I'm pretty sure. Two years ago,
your dermatologist called

432
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,448
and asked about a Q-switched laser.

433
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,041
I of course Googled a Q-switched laser

434
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,383
and found that they
in fact do remove tattoos.

435
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,978
But you canceled your appointment.

436
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,115
So what is it? Tribal ink?

437
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,092
Japanese calligraphy? Barbed wire?

438
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,960
You know, it's exciting for me
to experience you like this.

439
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:47,260
Thank you. You're gonna have
to tell me where it is, though.

440
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,766
- No, I'm not.
- They're gonna ask.

441
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,325
We're done with that question.
We're done with that question.

442
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,565
On to another question.
Let me see, let me see.

443
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:56,472
Oh, here's one. Whose place do we
stay at, yours or mine?

444
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,907
That's easy. Mine.

445
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,808
And why wouldn't we stay at mine?

446
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,336
Because I live at Central Park West.

447
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,316
And you probably live at some
squalid little studio apartment

448
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,319
with stacks of yellowed
Penguin Classics.

449
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:11,322
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please fasten your seat belts.</i>

450
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,950
<i>We are beginning our descent
into Juneau.</i>

451
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,721
Juneau? I thought
we were going to Sitka.

452
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:21,022
- We are.
- How are we getting to Sitka?

453
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,195
Whoa.

454
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:53,460
All right. Here we go.

455
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,835
- Oh, there he is!
- Andrew!

456
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,370
Hi. Right this way...

457
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,745
- Hi!
- Oh...

458
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,377
- It's so good to see you!
- You're suffocating him, Grace.

459
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,319
- Come here.
- Hey, Gammy.

460
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:19,118
Ah, Gammy. How are you doing?
Where's Dad?

461
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,853
Oh, you know your father.
He's always working.

462
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:24,259
Never mind about him. Where's your girl?

463
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,764
Uh, she's... right there.

464
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,390
- Ah.
- There she is.

465
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:31,402
I guess the word "girl"
is inappropriate.

466
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:32,767
Annie.

467
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:34,896
- Hi!
- Hello.

468
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,703
- Margaret, this is my mom.
- Oh, hello.

469
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:39,175
Yeah, great. This is my gammy, Annie.

470
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:42,305
- Pleasure.
- Well, hello there.

471
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:47,341
Now, do you prefer being called Margaret
or Satan's Mistress?

472
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:49,250
We've heard it both ways.

473
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,084
Actually we've heard it
lots of ways.

474
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,714
She's kidding.

475
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:55,225
Oh! Oh... OK.

476
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,727
Thank you so much for...

477
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,456
allowing me to be a part
of this weekend.

478
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,694
Oh, you're welcome.
We're thrilled to have you.

479
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,462
Let's get you two back to the fort.

480
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,629
- OK.
- Oh...

481
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,696
- It's so good to see you.
- There we are.

482
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:43,836
Andrew...

483
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:47,333
Andrew. Andrew!

484
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,808
Please, don't do that.

485
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,013
You didn't tell me about all
the family businesses, honey.

486
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,250
He was probably just
being modest, dear.

487
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,780
Oh.

488
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,360
What are we doing? Shouldn't we
check into our hotel right now?

489
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,802
Oh, we canceled your reservation.

490
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:14,270
Family doesn't stay at a hotel.

491
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,001
You're gonna stay in our home.

492
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,032
Oh, great! Great.

493
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,475
- What?
- God.

494
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,706
You're gonna wanna use your legs
to lift that one.

495
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,579
Andrew! Help her with those.

496
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,107
I'd love to, but she won't let me
do anything.

497
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:30,644
She insists on doing it all herself.
She's one of those... she's a feminist.

498
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,092
Come on, sweetie.

499
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,161
You see the shoes
that broad was wearing?

500
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:55,839
This is the last of 'em.

501
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:58,677
- Oh!
- Ooh.

502
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:01,880
- Five second rule.
- Got it!

503
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,252
That will dry right off.

504
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,519
Psst! Psst!
I'm not getting on that boat.

505
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,423
You don't have to.
See you in a few days.

506
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,690
Psst! You know I can't swim.

507
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,220
Hence, the boat.

508
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,604
Come on.

509
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,079
Come on. Here we go.

510
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:38,050
Looking good, boss.
Take your time, though.

511
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,148
Shh.

512
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:47,058
She comes with a lot of baggage.

513
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,429
Just gonna give you
a little hand here.

514
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,337
Hand off ass! Off ass!

515
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:59,001
There you go. You're there.

516
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:07,308
Congratulations.
I'm a hundred years old now.

517
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,805
Here we are. We're home.

518
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,208
That is your home?

519
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,646
Who are you people?

520
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,526
Why did you tell me
you were poor?

521
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,404
- I never said I was poor.
- But you never told me you were rich.

522
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,635
I'm not rich. My parents are rich.

523
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:07,110
OK, you know what?
That's something only rich people say.

524
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:08,669
Hey, Andrew! Welcome home!

525
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:11,443
Hi! Mom, what is this?

526
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,111
Nothing. It's just a little
welcoming party.

527
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:15,380
Is that a crime?

528
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,547
Just 50 of our closest
friends and neighbors.

529
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,250
And all excited to meet you.

530
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,622
- Oh, good. Good.
- Come on. Come on.

531
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,957
- A party?
- Yeah, I guess so.

532
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:26,623
Come on. Let's go. My grandma's
moving faster than you.

533
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:29,632
Put your back into it.

534
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,468
So nice to meet you,
Margaret. Welcome to Sitka.

535
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,500
Jill? Hi. Nice to meet you.
My pleasure.

536
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:42,707
Why didn't you tell me you were
some kind of Alaskan Kennedy?

537
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:43,805
How could I?

538
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:47,340
We were in the middle of talking about
you for the last three years.

539
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,080
OK, know what? Timeout, OK?

540
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,849
This bickering Bickerson thing
has got to stop.

541
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,880
People need to think that we are
in love. So let's just...

542
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,448
That, that's no problem.
I can do that.

543
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:57,359
I can pretend to be the doting fiancé.
That's easy.

544
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,862
But for you, it's going to require

545
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:01,297
that you stop snacking on
children while they dream.

546
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:04,028
Very funny. When are you going
to tell them we're engaged?

547
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,433
I'll pick the right moment.

548
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,338
Hey, Andrew. Hi!

549
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:12,002
Mrs. McKittrick. How are you?
Nice to see you.

550
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:14,034
Nice to see you, Mr. McKittrick.
This is Margaret.

551
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,943
- Hi. Pleasure.
- Margaret!

552
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,379
Hi, how are you? Pleasure.

553
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,816
So I always wanted to know,
what does a book editor do?

554
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,945
That's a great question, Louise.

555
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,387
I'm curious to know the answer myself.

556
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,220
- Hello, Dad.
- Son.

557
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,551
This must be Maggie.

558
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,222
Uh, Margaret.

559
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:35,721
- Joe. Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure's mine.

560
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:39,362
So why don't you tell us exactly
what a book editor does.

561
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:42,862
Besides taking writers out
to lunch and getting bombed.

562
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,273
Now that sounds like fun.

563
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,107
No wonder you like being an editor.

564
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:50,376
No, Louise. Andrew's not an editor,
he's an editor's assistant.

565
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,906
Maggie here is the editor.

566
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,509
Margaret.

567
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:58,044
- So you're actually...
- Andrew's boss. Yeah.

568
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,716
Well. How about that.

569
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:01,122
Huh.

570
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,150
I think I'll get a refill.

571
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,695
Charming.

572
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:13,561
That's a hell of
a first impression, Dad.

573
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,664
What the hell, Andrew?

574
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,471
You show up here after all this
time with this woman you hated

575
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,840
- and now she's your girlfriend?
- We just got here.

576
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,175
Can we wait two seconds

577
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,645
before we throw the
kitchen sink at each other?

578
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,911
Just never figured you for a guy
who slept his way to the middle.

579
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,645
Actually, I'll have you know
that that woman in there

580
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:29,312
is one of the most
respected editors in town.

581
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:30,446
She's your meal ticket,

582
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:31,955
and you brought her home
to meet your mother.

583
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:36,359
She's not my meal ticket, Dad.
She's my fiancée.

584
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,954
- What'd you say?
- You heard me.

585
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,794
I'm getting married.

586
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,269
- How are you?
- Good, good. Thank you.

587
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:47,635
Would you care for
some hors d'oeuvres?

588
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:48,969
No, I'm fine. Thank you very much.

589
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,338
It's a tradition.

590
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,036
It's the texture. I'm not a fish person.

591
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,476
- You'll like it.
- You're very sweet.

592
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:57,106
I think if you'll just taste it.

593
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:58,547
Thank you so much.

594
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:03,513
Ladies and gentlemen...

595
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:06,045
I have a very important
announcement to make.

596
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,682
Margaret and I are getting married.

597
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:08,987
It's the paprika.

598
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,392
So sorry.

599
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,226
That's OK. It's wash-and-wear.

600
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:18,058
Yep. Honey? Where you at?

601
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,567
Here it is.

602
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,236
Come on down here, pumpkin.

603
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,073
- All right.
- OK.

604
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,671
Oh, look at her. Look at her.

605
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:33,349
Right there, ladies and
gentlemen. There she is.

606
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,818
Congratulations, Andrew.

607
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:36,877
Thank you.

608
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,786
Thank you very much.

609
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:41,383
- Time to celebrate.
- Get the champagne.

610
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:45,989
So that was your idea
of the perfect time

611
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,224
- to tell them we're engaged?
- Mmm.

612
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:48,926
'Cause it was brilliant.
Brilliant timing.

613
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,935
Andrew. Hi.

614
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,905
Gert? Oh, my God. Hey, hi. Wow.

615
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,373
How you doing? I didn't know
that you were gonna be here.

616
00:32:57,408 --> 00:33:00,673
Your mom probably wanted it to
be a surprise. So... surprise.

617
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,203
- Right.
- And...

618
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:06,182
...we're being completely rude. Hi.

619
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:09,414
- Oh, God. This is my ex...
- Hi. I'm Gertrude.

620
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,888
- Oh! Oh, wow. Wow!
- You can call me Gert.

621
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,118
Well, congratulations, you guys.

622
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,591
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

623
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:17,150
So did I miss the story?

624
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,122
- What story?
- What story?

625
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,926
About how you proposed.

626
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:25,299
Oh! How a man proposes says
a lot about his character.

627
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,395
- Yes.
- Yes, it does.

628
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:30,066
I actually would love
to hear the story, Andrew.

629
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,234
Would you tell us?

630
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,607
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

631
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:35,509
You know what?

632
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:39,539
Actually, Margaret loves
telling this story...

633
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,144
so I'm just gonna let her
go ahead and do that.

634
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,381
'Cause I think we
should just sit in rapture.

635
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:47,721
Huh! Wow, OK.

636
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,593
Wow, where to begin... this story.

637
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:54,621
Well... um, wow.

638
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,724
Mmm... yeah.

639
00:33:56,768 --> 00:34:01,637
OK, well, um, Andrew and I...

640
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:04,436
Andrew and I were about to celebrate

641
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:07,069
- our first anniversary together.
- Aw...

642
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,944
And I knew that he'd been
itching to ask me to marry him.

643
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:13,178
And he was scared.
Like a little tiny bird.

644
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,617
So I started leaving him
little hints here and there...

645
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:18,417
...because I knew he wouldn't
have the guts to ask, but...

646
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:21,289
That's not exactly how it happened.

647
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:22,815
- No? Hmm.
- No. No.

648
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,420
I mean, I picked up on
all her little hints.

649
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,488
This woman's about as subtle as a gun.

650
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,762
Yeah.

651
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,132
What I was worried about was

652
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:33,034
that she might find this little box...

653
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,097
Oh! The decoupage box that he made

654
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,301
where he'd taken the time to cut out

655
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:41,106
tiny, little pictures of himself. Yes.

656
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:44,842
Just pasted all over the
box. Oh! So beautiful.

657
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:47,316
So I opened that beautiful,
little decoupage

658
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:51,219
and out fluttered these tiny,
little hand-cut heart confettis.

659
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:55,351
And once they cleared,
I looked down, and I saw...

660
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,055
...the most beautiful, big...

661
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,620
...fat nothing.

662
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,029
No ring.

663
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:02,657
- No ring?
- What?

664
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,692
No. But inside that box...

665
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,397
...underneath all that crap...

666
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,702
...there was a little
handwritten note...

667
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,267
with the address to
a hotel, date, and time.

668
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,006
Real Humphrey Bogart-type stuff.

669
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,411
Yeah.

670
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,278
Masculine.

671
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,181
Anyway, naturally, Margaret thought...

672
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,776
I thought he was seeing someone else.

673
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,946
It was a terrible time for me,

674
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:26,354
but I went to that hotel anyway.

675
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,483
I went there and I pounded on the door,

676
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:30,357
but the door was already unlocked.

677
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:34,262
And as swung open that
door, there he was...

678
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,822
- Standing.
- Kneeling.

679
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,425
- Like a man.
- On a bed of rose petals,

680
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,926
in a tuxedo. Your son. Your son.

681
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,533
And he was choking back
soft, soft sobs.

682
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:47,840
And when he held back the tears
and finally caught his breath,

683
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:48,937
he said to me...

684
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,038
"Margaret, will you marry me?"

685
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:53,414
And she said, "Yep. "
The end. Who's hungry?

686
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:58,448
That is quite a story.

687
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,389
- Oh, Andy!
- Gorgeous.

688
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:02,858
You are so sensitive.

689
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,653
Hand-cut confetti?

690
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:09,530
Hey! Let's see a kiss
from you two cuties.

691
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:10,659
Give her a kiss!

692
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,760
- No. Come on.
- Oh, yeah.

693
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:13,827
Come on!

694
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,429
OK, all right.

695
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:17,338
OK. Here we go. Ready?

696
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:23,242
What is this? Kiss her on
the mouth like you mean it.

697
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:26,876
- Kiss her. Kiss her!
- Kiss her!

698
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:30,820
Kiss her! Kiss her!
Kiss her! Kiss her!

699
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,482
OK!

700
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:34,716
- OK. All right.
- OK.

701
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,920
- Here we go.
- Mmm-hmm. OK.

702
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,426
Oh!

703
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:43,092
Andy! Give her a real kiss!

704
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,796
- Gammy.
- A real one!

705
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,360
- Yeah.
- You can do it!

706
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,066
Why don't we just do it?
Let's just do it really fast.

707
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,668
Mmmm.

708
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,645
- Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

709
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,841
- OK.
- Mmm.

710
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,683
Hmm.

711
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,691
I'm so happy for you two!

712
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:15,096
So happy! So happy!

713
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:16,997
Let's get the champagne!

714
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,869
So here we are.

715
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,435
This is your bedroom.

716
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:30,636
Wow. Wow, this is, um...
beautiful. And the view.

717
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,478
And here's the bed.

718
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:35,314
Wow! Exquisite bed. Exquisite.

719
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:38,322
So... where is Andrew's room?

720
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,290
Oh, sweetie, we're not
under any illusions

721
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:43,191
that you two don't
sleep in the same bed.

722
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,491
He'll sleep
in here with you.

723
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,895
Oh, great, 'cause we love to snuggle.

724
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,866
- Don't we, honey.
- We're huge snugglers.

725
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,130
Oh, my God. What is it?

726
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:56,071
- Calm down, Kevin.
- Whoa! You are cute.

727
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,699
Who is this?

728
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:01,337
- That's Kevin. I'm sorry, Margaret.
- So cute.

729
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,438
We just rescued him from the pound,

730
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,472
and he's still in training. Sorry.

731
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,484
Just be sure you don't
let him outside,

732
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,315
or the eagles will snatch him.

733
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,218
No, don't you listen to her.

734
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:13,052
She's just pulling
your leg, isn't she?

735
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,423
By the way, there are extra
towels and linens and things

736
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,518
in here if you need them.

737
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:19,392
And if you
get chilly tonight...

738
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,091
...use this.

739
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,861
It has special powers.

740
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,892
Oh, what kind of special powers?

741
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:27,563
I call it the Baby Maker.

742
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,698
OK, well. Then I guess we...

743
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,264
...gonna be super careful with that one.

744
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,436
- Yeah, I'm just gonna...
- Don't throw it on the bed.

745
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,445
We'd better turn in.
It's been quite an evening.

746
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,208
So good night, everybody.

747
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:38,545
- Good night.
- Good night.

748
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:41,574
- Good night.
- Good night, Gammy.

749
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,781
- Good night.
- Good night.

750
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,517
- Good night.
- Good night, Gammy.

751
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,993
Thank you so much. Sweet dreams.

752
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,723
- Bye-bye, now.
- Bye.

753
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,835
So, uh... you haven't
been home in a while.

754
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:02,168
I haven't had a lot of vacation
time the last three years.

755
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,401
Stop complaining.

756
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:09,939
Um... Don't look, OK?

757
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,077
OK.

758
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:14,545
Are your eyes closed?

759
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:15,882
Completely.

760
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,287
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

761
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:31,629
Those are the pajamas you
decided to bring to Alaska.

762
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:35,127
Yes, because I was supposed
to be in a hotel alone.

763
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:38,164
- Remember?
- Can we just go to sleep?

764
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,268
- Fine.
- Great.

765
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,169
Well.

766
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:13,471
Looks like I won't be
getting much sleep

767
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:16,036
with the sun streaming in.

768
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,910
Thank you.

769
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,076
Andrew. Phone.

770
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,580
Andrew!

771
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,014
Crap. Andrew, Andrew, phone.

772
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,415
Andrew!

773
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,386
Yeah... right.

774
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:03,551
- Andrew, where is it?
- Purse, side pocket.

775
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:12,162
Hello. Hello? Hello.

776
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:14,068
Frank! Frank, darling.

777
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,162
Darling, Frank.

778
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,504
Are you there? Hello? Hello? Oh, crap.

779
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,999
I have horrible service, Frank.
Give me just one minute.

780
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,808
Oh, my God! Margaret!

781
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,407
One... one minute.
Frank, hold on just a second.

782
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:26,473
Frank, hold on. No, no, no, no.

783
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,381
Frank. Frank, I'm sorry you feel

784
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:33,083
I pressured you into doing Oprah, but...

785
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:36,581
Of course I want you
to be happy. Yes, yes.

786
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:42,463
Frank. Frank. Frank, darling.
Frank? It's going to be fine.

787
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,627
I can just call them and I can cancel.

788
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,741
You are...
you are so right, Frank.

789
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,902
Yes, Frank, of course
I'm listening to you.

790
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:55,605
Yeah... yes.

791
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,238
I love listening to you, Frank.

792
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:00,842
Shh! Sit. Sit.

793
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,312
No, not you, Frank.

794
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,151
No, no.

795
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,918
Frank, if I may get down to it, OK...

796
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:10,484
I think it would be
a mistake to back out.

797
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,725
Because, Frank, for so many years...

798
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:17,222
...you have inspired me with your
beautiful words, and I feel that...

799
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:18,895
Shh! Dog, I'm on the phone.

800
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:21,837
I think it's time that the world
get to enjoy your words as well.

801
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,396
They are just so rich

802
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,566
with... passion...

803
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:29,272
And I think that we
should all be privy to.

804
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:31,008
Frank, I just, uh...

805
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,640
I just, uh, want you
to be happy, Frank.

806
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:35,174
Give me that dog!

807
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,653
Frank, hold on a second.
Can you hold a second?

808
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:38,712
Give me that dog!

809
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:41,948
Come on! Come on, come on, come on.

810
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:44,256
Come on! Come on! Oh, oh...

811
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,820
Oh, oh! Oh, oh. OK! OK, gotcha.

812
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,695
Frank, Frank.

813
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,926
Frank? So sorry, so sorry.

814
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:53,095
So sorry. I dropped the phone.
Now, listen, Frank.

815
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:55,867
I don't want to sell you on anything,

816
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,703
but this is your legacy, this book.

817
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,140
And I think it's up to you to

818
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:00,200
present your legacy to the world.

819
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:03,441
And call me tomorrow with your decision.

820
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,209
And my phone is on
all the time! OK, bye-bye.

821
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,273
No! Wait!

822
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:09,679
No! No! N-n-n... no. No

823
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,244
Take the doggy. Look at the doggy.

824
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:13,188
I need that phone. Take the dog.

825
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:14,690
Take the dog. I need that phone!

826
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:18,024
Here. Take the dog.
Take the dog. Take it. Take it.

827
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,053
Look at this.

828
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:24,062
- Is that cute or what?
- I know.

829
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,800
Morning, guys. Have you seen... daah.

830
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:31,967
She's playing with Kevin.
We thought she didn't like him.

831
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,033
Will you go get her, Andy?

832
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:35,045
We have a whole day planned for her,

833
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,013
and she needs to get ready.

834
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,311
Yeah. Tell her we have
a big surprise for her.

835
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,977
Mmm.

836
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:46,523
Look! Give me my phone. Come on.
Please, just give me my phone.

837
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:49,185
- Come on. Right here.
- What the hell are you doing?

838
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:52,218
Oh, my God. Your grandmother
was completely right.

839
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,059
The eagle came
and tried to take the dog.

840
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:57,556
But then I saved him. Then it
came back, and it took my phone.

841
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:59,967
- Are you drunk?
- What? No! I'm serious.

842
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:02,472
He's got my phone, and Frank's
calling me on that phone.

843
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:03,837
Relax, all right?

844
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:06,934
We'll order another phone, same number.
We'll go into town tomorrow and get it.

845
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,035
- Really?
- Yeah.

846
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:13,209
Oh, OK. All right. Well, you go then.

847
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,081
- You have to get ready.
- For what?

848
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,552
You're going out with Mom and the girls.

849
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:19,249
- I don't want to go out.
- Shopping, sightseeing. And a surprise.

850
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,756
- I hate shopping.
- You'll love it.

851
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,258
- I hate sightseeing.
- You're going.

852
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:23,554
- No, I don't want to go.
- You're going.

853
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,221
- I'm not going. I'm not going.
- Yes, you are.

854
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:26,729
Now give me a nice big hug.
We don't want them

855
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:27,890
- to think we're fighting.
- I don't want to touch you.

856
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:29,728
- Come on. Hug time.
- No, I don't want to...

857
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,496
- Hug time.
- I don't want to...

858
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,298
There we go.

859
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,033
Yeah, that's nice.

860
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:38,769
Yeah. That's nice.

861
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,369
There we go. Isn't that nice?

862
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:42,936
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

863
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,447
- Mmm. Yeah.
- Boop boop boop.

864
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:46,745
If you touch my ass one more time,

865
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:48,945
I will cut your balls
off in your sleep. OK?

866
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,817
- Yeah.
- There you go.

867
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,516
All righty now. So, uh...
We clear on that?

868
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:55,923
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Such a good fiancé.

869
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:57,756
Hmm. Ow.

870
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,439
<i>- Jeez.
- You want to see me?</i>

871
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:17,174
Your mom found these eco-balls.

872
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,079
They dissolve in water.

873
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,448
I don't know how she
comes up with this stuff.

874
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:27,446
Anyway, she, uh... is a little peeved.

875
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:31,484
Apparently, I wasn't the most
gracious of hosts last night.

876
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:32,825
It was a little bit of a shock

877
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:34,421
to find out that
you're getting married...

878
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:37,696
...especially when none of us
even knew you were dating.

879
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:42,536
The point is... I owe you an apology.

880
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,335
Accepted.

881
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:49,106
There's something else.

882
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:52,980
I've been going over my
retirement plans recently,

883
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:54,540
and it got me thinking.

884
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,777
I've done a lot of things in my life.

885
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:01,518
Practically built an empire with
your mother from the ground up.

886
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:02,718
It doesn't mean anything unless...

887
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,159
Unless you have someone to leave it to.

888
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:07,630
- We already discussed this.
- I'd like to discuss it again.

889
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:11,600
You have responsibilities here.

890
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:13,398
I think I've been
more than understanding

891
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,836
about your goofing off in New York.

892
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:16,533
I need you to quit playing around...

893
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:17,631
Here we go again.

894
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:19,972
When are you going to start
taking what I do seriously?

895
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:21,875
When you start acting seriously.

896
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:24,380
I'm sorry.

897
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,382
I feel sorry for you, Dad.

898
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,941
I wish you had another son. I really do.

899
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,146
One who wanted to stay here.

900
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:31,950
One who wanted to take over
the family business.

901
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,048
One who wanted to marry someone
that you approve of,

902
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:37,424
but it's not me. Now,
it must seem strange to you,

903
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:42,398
my life in New York... sitting
in an office, reading books.

904
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:45,026
But it makes me happy. You understand?

905
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:51,663
If that's what makes you happy,
son, I got nothing to say.

906
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,733
Well, that's a first.

907
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:58,476
You know what? Apology not
accepted. Have fun out here.

908
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:14,286
There is no way you
could leave her at home.

909
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,094
She had to be here. Absolutely.

910
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,158
She's been coming here forever.

911
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,966
I hope you are ready
for your big surprise...

912
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:24,303
...because this is one of
Sitka's greatest treasures.

913
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,605
- Right?
- Oh, yes. Oh, yeah.

914
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:29,945
OK, this is the big surprise

915
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,381
I was telling you about. You ready?

916
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:37,548
Oh, Margaret,
you're gonna love it!

917
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,183
Ramone's the only
exotic dancer on the island.

918
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,450
But we're lucky to have him.

919
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:22,789
Work it, Ramone!

920
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:28,236
- Wow.
- Over here, Ramone! Over here.

921
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:29,739
Over here, honey.

922
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,406
Show her what
she's gonna be missing.

923
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:34,774
Come, my sexy princess.

924
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:36,506
- Yeah!
- Oh, no. Not necessary.

925
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:39,413
It's a really nice gesture,
but I really need to just...

926
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:40,677
Go on, Margaret. Get up there!

927
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:41,775
You come dance.

928
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:43,308
OK, pluck my eyes out. OK.

929
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:46,982
All right. Here we go.

930
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:49,083
Go, Margaret! Go, Margaret!

931
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:52,254
Hey.

932
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:53,320
Hey... oh.

933
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:55,695
Give it to her, Ramone!

934
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,371
Go on, Ramone! Give it to her!

935
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,049
Ooh, that's a move I haven't seen.

936
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:22,454
Look at her face!

937
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:26,690
Guess who.
For you. For you. For you.

938
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,631
- Yeah!
- Enjoy!

939
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:37,806
I don't want to touch it.
No. OK, OK. Very sweet.

940
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:38,967
No, no, no, no, no.

941
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:42,437
Smack him!

942
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,879
- I'm sorry?
- Smack his ass.

943
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:46,883
Smack it. OK.

944
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,555
- Smack him, Margaret!
- Give it to him!

945
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:56,116
Yeah! Woo!

946
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,956
Can I get down now?

947
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,106
Free. Be free.

948
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:21,512
Hey! There you are.
How are you holding up?

949
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:25,681
Oh, fine. Fine. Just working on my tan.

950
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:28,714
Yeah, the Paxtons can be
a bit overwhelming at times.

951
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:29,885
Yes, yes.

952
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,121
It's a little different
than New York, huh?

953
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:36,621
Little bit. Little bit. You ever been?

954
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:39,658
No. That was always
Andrew's dream, not mine.

955
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,069
You guys were pretty serious, huh?

956
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:44,835
Well, I mean, we dated in high
school and all through college,

957
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,968
but we were kids.

958
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:51,270
And you guys called it off because of...

959
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,682
Well, um...

960
00:50:55,719 --> 00:51:00,383
the night before we graduated
school, he proposed...

961
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:01,948
...and said he wanted to elope

962
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:04,756
and run away to New York with me.

963
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,355
And...

964
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,262
You said "no. "

965
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:12,234
And I said "no," yeah.

966
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:16,205
I've never been anywhere
but here. This is home.

967
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:21,040
But anyway... you're a lucky girl.

968
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:26,311
He really is the best, which
you obviously already know.

969
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:31,116
Oh, yep. Yep, very much so, yeah.

970
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:34,351
Well, cheers to you guys.

971
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:39,317
Oh... Thank you.

972
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:46,901
Looks like Ramone's
wrappin' it up.

973
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:51,774
Go, Annie!

974
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:53,867
I've never seen him so...

975
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,969
- No, he really got down.
... out there. I mean...

976
00:51:56,012 --> 00:52:00,210
He was wonderful.

977
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:01,979
Oh, no.

978
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,622
Andrew!

979
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:11,923
Andrew, honey, is everything OK?

980
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:17,263
What... What's he doing?

981
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,768
Something's up. It's best
to leave him alone.

982
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,065
Come on, honey.

983
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:27,200
<i>...Hunt's version
of that here tonight.</i>

984
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,940
Hey, hey, hey. What are you
doing? I'm watching that.

985
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,311
Why is Andrew out there

986
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:33,748
hollowing out that old
stupid canoe again?

987
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:36,217
Well, maybe he's
planning to escape. What?

988
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:38,050
I am so tired.

989
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:39,919
Think I'm gonna go
upstairs, take a shower,

990
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:42,151
wash off Ramone's coconut body oil.

991
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:43,557
Sure.

992
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:45,925
I had a great day today. Thank you.

993
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:49,222
What did you do?

994
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:51,496
I didn't do anything, I mean...

995
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:55,494
I just had a frank conversation
with him about his future.

996
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:58,167
Oh... Well, yeah.
That's a good idea.

997
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,675
That's a good idea, Joe,

998
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:01,939
because he will never
come back home now.

999
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:05,573
He is my son. I only get
to see him every three years

1000
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:08,049
because of you. Because of you.

1001
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:09,142
I've had enough.

1002
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,654
- You are gonna be supportive...
- Shh!

1003
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,814
...of him marrying
Margaret, and that is that.

1004
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,654
Shh! Shh! Shh!

1005
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,250
You know, if we're not careful,

1006
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:20,195
we are gonna end up in
this great big house...

1007
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,357
...just you and me alone...

1008
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:24,128
...you and me and everything
that we're angry about,

1009
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:27,466
and God forbid that they
should have a grandchild

1010
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,199
that we never get to see.

1011
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:33,300
You are going to fix this,
Joe. I mean it. Fix it now.

1012
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:45,883
Where's a towel?

1013
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,051
Towel...

1014
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:58,228
Towel, towel, towel... towel, towel.

1015
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:00,099
This is all they have for a towel?

1016
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:02,627
It's ridiculous. I can't get dry.

1017
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:06,700
Hello.

1018
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,503
Hello?

1019
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:16,716
Oh!

1020
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:20,513
Oh! Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

1021
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:21,581
No, no, no, no, no.

1022
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:23,388
J- j-just... I'm sorry.

1023
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,587
L- I-let me just,
let me just get a towel.

1024
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:27,062
Let me just get a towel.

1025
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,031
Just... look.

1026
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,726
You need to just... I'm sorry.

1027
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,257
OK, I'm sorry for
feeding you to the eagle.

1028
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:33,769
I'm sorry.

1029
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:39,568
Go away. Go away.

1030
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,873
Go, go. Just let me get a towel.

1031
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:44,971
Go, go, go... Hold on.

1032
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:53,016
Yeah. Huh?

1033
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:56,082
How you like that? Huh?

1034
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,060
Take it, take it. That's right.

1035
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:00,722
That's what I'm talking
about. You like that?

1036
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:05,562
Oh. You like it.

1037
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:13,476
Come here. Come to Mama.

1038
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,569
That's right. Get on the carpet.

1039
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,603
That's a good boy.

1040
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:21,913
Yes! That's good, boy! Come on.

1041
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:23,612
Come on!

1042
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,177
Oh, oh!

1043
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:32,250
- Oh, oh!
- What the?

1044
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:34,820
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

1045
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:37,264
- Why are you naked? My God!
- Oh, God. Why are you wet?

1046
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,894
- Don't look at me.
- I don't understand.

1047
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,426
- Why are you wet?
- Why are you naked?

1048
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:43,132
Don't look at me.

1049
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,767
Oh, God! You're showing everything.

1050
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:47,800
Cover it up, for the love of God!

1051
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:52,110
Oh, God, not the Baby Maker.

1052
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:53,672
Explain yourself please.

1053
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:55,947
- Explain myself?
- Yes, explain yourself.

1054
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:57,145
- I was outside.
- Oh, really?

1055
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,451
- You didn't hear me?
- I was listening to...

1056
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:00,683
What are you even doing home?

1057
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:02,851
Then you just, jump me
out of nowhere? What's that?

1058
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:04,621
I di... I didn't mean to jump you.

1059
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:08,961
Your dog was attacking me, and I
had to run, and I ran into you.

1060
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:10,625
What is it with you and this dog?

1061
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:12,658
Just, you know, just... go.

1062
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:13,999
- Go...
- Fine.

1063
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,629
- Go take a shower. You stink.
- Fine.

1064
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:17,503
- Nice tattoo, by the way.
- What?

1065
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:22,042
See? See? Exactly. You see that?

1066
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:24,672
Oh... barely made it out
with my life there.

1067
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,648
<i>See the size of the teeth on that thing?</i>

1068
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:28,082
I didn't...

1069
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:47,795
So... So naked.

1070
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:51,739
Can we, uh, not talk about that, please?

1071
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,433
Just sayin'.

1072
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:01,875
So, uh, what's the deal
with you and your father?

1073
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:06,548
Ooh, I'm sorry. That question
is not in the binder.

1074
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,955
Oh, really? Well, I thought
you were the one that said

1075
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:10,323
we needed to learn all this...

1076
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,918
Not about that, I didn't.

1077
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:13,861
- But if the guy asks us...
- Not about that, Margaret.

1078
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:15,728
Good night.

1079
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:35,150
- I like the Psychic Network.
- What?

1080
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:37,949
Not in the "ha-ha, isn't that
funny, she likes that trash"

1081
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:41,047
kind of way. I actually quite enjoy it.

1082
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:42,648
Umm...

1083
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,730
I took disco lessons in the sixth grade.

1084
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,927
My first concert was
Rob Base & D.J. E-Z Rock.

1085
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:59,437
I think Brian Dennehy is sexy.

1086
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:02,174
Don't like flowers in the house,

1087
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:05,511
'cause they remind me of funerals.

1088
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:07,072
Never played a video game.

1089
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:11,119
<i>I read Wuthering Heights
every Christmas.</i>

1090
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,520
It's my favorite book.

1091
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:20,786
Haven't slept with a man
in over a year and a half.

1092
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:25,359
And, uh... I went to
the bathroom and cried

1093
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:28,427
after Bob called me a poisonous bitch.

1094
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:32,906
And the, uh, bird tattoo?

1095
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:34,341
They're swallows.

1096
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:40,974
Got them when I was 16...
after my parents died.

1097
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:46,445
Stupid.

1098
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:48,582
I'm sure there's many many other things,

1099
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:51,093
but that's all I can
come up with right now.

1100
00:58:58,234 --> 00:58:59,701
You, uh, there?

1101
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:03,967
I'm here.

1102
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:08,406
Just processing.

1103
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:17,416
You really haven't slept
with anyone in 18 months?

1104
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:19,944
Oh, my God. Out of all that,
that's all you got?

1105
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:21,456
That's a long time.

1106
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:23,789
Yeah, well, I've been a little busy.

1107
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:25,953
Yeah...

1108
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:30,398
Who's, uh...

1109
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:33,561
- Rob Base and D. J...
- E-Z Rock?

1110
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:35,366
- Yeah.
- You know.

1111
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:44,076
- No. They were good.
- Mm-mm.

1112
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:51,914
- What?
- Nothing.

1113
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:55,482
I know who they are. I just
wanted to hear you sing it.

1114
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:06,500
- Margaret?
- Yes?

1115
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:10,839
Don't take this the wrong way.

1116
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:15,239
'K.

1117
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:20,306
You are a very... very beautiful woman.

1118
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:47,810
- Feel it deep, feel it low.
- Mmm-hmm.

1119
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:52,208
God, I can't sing that high.

1120
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:17,499
Huh? Where am I?

1121
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:20,740
What time is it?

1122
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:22,335
What time is it?

1123
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:26,007
Ooh! Ooh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh...

1124
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:40,288
Oh, God.

1125
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:06,318
Room service.
Breakfast for the happy couple.

1126
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:08,880
Andrew! Andrew!

1127
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:11,860
Andr...

1128
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,361
Your mother's at the door. Get up!

1129
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:14,761
- Get up here! Your mother's...
- Oh, God.

1130
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:16,389
Just a second!

1131
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:23,068
- Not the baby blanket.
- OK, all right.

1132
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:25,836
Not the baby blanket. Get it
off, get it off, get it off.

1133
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,809
- OK, all right.
- Wait a second. Hold on.

1134
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:29,812
- What? What?
- Are you wearing makeup?

1135
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:31,575
What? No. Of course not.

1136
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:34,674
- OK, what do we do? All right.
- Just spoon me, spoon me...

1137
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:37,481
- Oh, my God! What is that?
- I'm sorry. It's morning.

1138
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,488
What do you mean, "It's morning"?

1139
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:41,183
Are you OK?

1140
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:44,057
Yep! Coming. One second. Yep.
Come on in. Everything's fine.

1141
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,584
Disgusting.

1142
01:02:46,629 --> 01:02:48,426
Ow, you're on my hair. OK, just...

1143
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:57,002
- Oh, wow.
- Ooh, smells good.

1144
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,438
Cinnamon rolls.

1145
01:02:58,474 --> 01:03:00,567
Oh, you shouldn't have
gone to that trouble.

1146
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,579
Oh, you're family now. It's no trouble.

1147
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:06,013
Hey, you have room for one more?

1148
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:10,178
Wow. Could we not do the
Brady family meeting right now?

1149
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:11,243
We just got up...

1150
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:12,686
- Yeah.
... if you don't mind.

1151
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:14,781
Your mother and I have
come up with a proposition

1152
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:18,021
and I happen to think
it's a terrific idea...

1153
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,324
We want you
to get married here tomorrow.

1154
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:21,489
Tomorrow.

1155
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:25,526
- What? What? What?
- Mmm-mmm. No.

1156
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:27,229
Well, you're gonna get married anyway,

1157
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:29,670
so why don't you get married here...

1158
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:31,104
...where we can be all together,

1159
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,439
and that way Grandma Annie
can be a part of it.

1160
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,638
- Oh. Oh, we're...
- No.

1161
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:40,012
No. No, it's Gammy's
big birthday tomorrow night.

1162
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:41,141
Big day for her.

1163
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:43,277
We don't want to ruin it.
That's you know...

1164
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:47,050
I've had 89 birthday parties,
I don't need another one.

1165
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:48,488
Oh, Gammy.

1166
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:50,992
It would be a dream come true for me

1167
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:53,393
to see my one grandchild's wedding.

1168
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,693
- A dream come true!
- Mmmm.

1169
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:58,928
- So you'll do it?
- Mmm-mmm.

1170
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:00,629
Before I'm dead?

1171
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,069
- OK. OK.
- OK.

1172
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:06,637
OK, we will do everything.

1173
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,236
And you can get married
like we did, in the barn.

1174
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:11,405
It's a Paxton family tradition.

1175
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:14,143
- Oh, wow!
- Yup.

1176
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:19,485
Wow! Uh! I've always wanted to
get married in a... in a barn.

1177
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,854
- I have.
- It's a sign.

1178
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:25,657
A sign from the universe that
you're meant to be together.

1179
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,858
Oh, we must give thanks, I tell you.

1180
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:32,026
Come, come. We must give thanks.

1181
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:34,696
OK, I know I should leave you alone now.

1182
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:38,195
But we're just so excited!
I know you're excited, too.

1183
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:40,141
<i>- It's the craziest.
- Really excited.</i>

1184
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:43,577
Yeah! Go. Go.

1185
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:44,705
Go.

1186
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:52,484
Oh, my God.

1187
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:54,421
When my mom finds out that
this whole thing is a sham

1188
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:55,788
she's gonna... she's gonna be crushed,

1189
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:58,020
and my grandmother's gonna die.

1190
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,687
- Your mom's not going to find out.
- I... my father.

1191
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,287
What the hell's with that?
The whole wedding thing?

1192
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:02,354
Where did that come from?

1193
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,628
She probably got him worked up into it.

1194
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:05,895
It's fine. She's not gonna find out.

1195
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:08,062
- They're not going to find out.
- Oh, God. Margaret!

1196
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:11,562
Andrew, they're not gonna
find out, OK? Just relax.

1197
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:13,165
It's gonna be OK.

1198
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:15,700
It's not like we're
gonna be married forever.

1199
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,339
We'll be happily divorced
before you know it.

1200
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:22,784
It will be fine. It will be fine.

1201
01:05:22,818 --> 01:05:24,376
You OK?

1202
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,047
Yeah.

1203
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:33,118
- Get us some coffee.
- Yeah.

1204
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:36,859
So, would you like a cinnamon soy latte?

1205
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:38,628
A- ha.

1206
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:44,830
You're right, you know...

1207
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:46,171
Get a quickie divorce, we'll be fine.

1208
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:47,835
- Absolutely.
- It's gonna be fine.

1209
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:50,243
Everything is going to be great.

1210
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,179
But this little missus
better learn how to cook...

1211
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:54,045
...so she can take care of her husband.

1212
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,209
Keep my man happy.

1213
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:56,980
I don't want him leaving
me for another woman.

1214
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:58,111
Come on...

1215
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:00,918
...haven't left you yet, Margaret.

1216
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:03,824
I got it. Let go.

1217
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:08,162
- You all right?
- Yeah, um...

1218
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:09,687
You know what? I'm gonna go.

1219
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:11,029
Where?

1220
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:13,968
I just kinda feel like going outside.

1221
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:16,528
All right. That's the bathroom.

1222
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:17,971
Oh, yeah. I know. I'm just, uh...

1223
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:21,204
I'm gonna go to go to the bathroom,
and then I'm gonna go out, outside.

1224
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:22,267
All right.

1225
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:24,846
All right.

1226
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:40,694
OK, you just have to focus,
Margaret. Just focus.

1227
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:43,494
This is a business deal.
This is just a business deal.

1228
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:48,299
Everything's
gonna be just fine.

1229
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:53,507
OK, this is a little
rough. I can do this.

1230
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:57,445
Oh, my God. God, I hate nature!

1231
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,811
I hate it.

1232
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:02,249
Not stopping. Not stopping. Oh! Oh...

1233
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:04,252
Why are you not stopping?

1234
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:06,720
Stop, stop, stop it, stop!

1235
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:13,453
I just wanted... some air.

1236
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,291
What is that?

1237
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:25,000
What now? What is that? What is that?

1238
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:27,475
What is that?

1239
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:42,350
What is that?

1240
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:01,904
Come to me,
Margaret of New York.

1241
01:08:01,944 --> 01:08:04,412
It is I, Grandma Annie.

1242
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:05,812
Oh!

1243
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:08,339
I see you are a curious one.

1244
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:11,376
Come. See how I give
thanks to Mother Earth.

1245
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,820
You know, actually,
I'm not that curious.

1246
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:15,721
- I'll just...
- Look around you.

1247
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:18,283
Mother Earth has provided all this...

1248
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:22,764
...just as she brought you and
Andrew together to be joined.

1249
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:25,426
- Oh.
- We must give thanks

1250
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:28,665
and ask that your loins
be abundantly fertile.

1251
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:32,162
Come. Dance with me in celebration.

1252
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:35,541
You know, can I, can I
just thank her from here?

1253
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:37,443
I insist!

1254
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,778
OK, OK, OK.

1255
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:42,579
I will come down and dance with you.

1256
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:47,583
Follow and learn.

1257
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:55,557
Come on, Margaret! Feel the
rhythm of the drums. Now you.

1258
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:57,122
- Me what?
- Chant.

1259
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:58,724
Chant what?

1260
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:00,894
Whatever comes
to you. It is the way.

1261
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:04,702
- But I don't know any chants.
- To the trees. Use your vowels.

1262
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:08,506
- Eee. Ooo. Ooo. Eee.
- Ooo. Eee.

1263
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:10,307
- Yes. Chant.
- Yes. Chant, chant.

1264
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:12,473
- Eee. To the trees.
- Yes! Yes!

1265
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:16,542
- To the universe!
- The universe. Ah. Universe.

1266
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:20,351
<i>To the crazy.
To the window, the window.</i>

1267
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:22,050
To the wall, to the wall.

1268
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:23,786
To the sweat drip down my balls.

1269
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,260
- To all you bitches...
- Louder!

1270
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:28,229
To the window, to the window.

1271
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:29,993
To the walls, to the walls.

1272
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:31,624
To the sweat drip down my balls.

1273
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,931
Now all you bitches crawl.

1274
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:35,630

01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,216
Oh, uh.

1298
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:26,551
Uh... You know,
your Gammy wanted me to...

1299
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:28,489
...you know, chant.
Chant from the heart.

1300
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:31,015
Balls? That's what came to your heart?

1301
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,791
You know, it went with the beat.

1302
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:36,593
Your phone arrived.

1303
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:38,190
I'm gonna go into town
to pick it up. Wanna come?

1304
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:41,135
Oh, yes, I want to go.
I want to go. Oh, hold on.

1305
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:44,071
Is it, uh, OK if I go with him?

1306
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:46,734
Whatever you do is what shall be.

1307
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:48,903
But you're OK if I go?

1308
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:52,402
- Fine. Go on.
- Bye, Gammy.

1309
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:54,939
- You're a freak!
- Shut up.

1310
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:57,452
Would you, please?

1311
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,044
Ow!

1312
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:18,331
Hey, buddy.

1313
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:20,103
Andrew, hey!

1314
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:23,111
- You got that phone I ordered?
- Yes, it came in. How are you?

1315
01:11:23,145 --> 01:11:25,045
- Great. You?
- Good.

1316
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,439
<i>Hola.</i>

1317
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:31,878
Hey, hi.

1318
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,547
<i>Remember this?</i>

1319
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:34,681
Yes, yes.

1320
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:37,283
Wonderful. Wonderful. Yes.

1321
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:40,295
- Remember that?
- Yes. Yes. I know.

1322
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,490
Think you made quite
an impression on Ramone.

1323
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:47,900
Mmm-hmm, I think the part
where I burst into tears

1324
01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:49,563
just really brought us together.

1325
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:51,072
- Yeah. Oh, guess what.
- What?

1326
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:52,539
Fun fact about Andrew number 11:

1327
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:54,098
- I like Pringles.
- Mm-hmm. OK.

1328
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,508
They're delicious. All Hostess products.

1329
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:57,205
Coke, never Pepsi, and beef jerky.

1330
01:11:57,246 --> 01:11:58,508
What, are you, like, 13?

1331
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:00,139
- Mmm.
- Here we go.

1332
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:01,410
It's all charged up, Andrew.

1333
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:02,474
Thanks, buddy.

1334
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,652
And I put your lady's number in, too.

1335
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:08,179
- Thank you very mu...
- Milady.

1336
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:13,518
Thank you, thank you very much.
Thank you.

1337
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:14,927
Just... thank you.

1338
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,762
Oh, my God. I have 37 messages.

1339
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:24,136
Shit. I need a computer.

1340
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,004
Is there, is there a computer
in this godforsaken town?

1341
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:32,842
OK. So when it runs out,
it gives you a warning.

1342
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:34,212
Just put in more dimes.

1343
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:37,448
- Here you go.
- What?

1344
01:12:37,486 --> 01:12:39,420
- You're kidding. Dimes?
- Come on, Kels.

1345
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:40,922
- You're not kidding?
- I'll be outside.

1346
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:42,287
- Yell if you need me.
- But what am I supposed...

1347
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:43,985
You'll be fine.

1348
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:50,122
OK, I can figure this out.
I'm an intelligent woman.

1349
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:52,599
Block 'em out, block 'em out,
block 'em out. There you go.

1350
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:54,329
OK.

1351
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,600
Now.

1352
01:12:56,638 --> 01:12:58,128
What is that? What is it?

1353
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:04,836
Um, uh, excuse me? Excuse...

1354
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:09,676
OK.

1355
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:14,546
OK.

1356
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:44,979
So, it was nice
to see Gertrude, huh?

1357
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,487
Yeah.

1358
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:48,717
She looked really pretty today.

1359
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:51,990
- Yeah, she did.
- Mmm-hmm.

1360
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:56,254
Must be nice to see each other
again and just catch up.

1361
01:13:56,298 --> 01:13:58,425
It's definitely good to see her. It's...

1362
01:13:58,467 --> 01:14:00,298
...definitely, yeah.
It's been a long time.

1363
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:04,572
Oh, there they are.
There they are. Margaret!

1364
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:05,937
Woo!

1365
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:07,066
We need Margaret.

1366
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,669
Afraid we're going to have to
steal you away, young lady.

1367
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:11,235
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm just gonna keep...

1368
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,975
No, not to worry.

1369
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:15,347
No strippers, no chanting
in the woods. Promise.

1370
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:17,249
- Oh, well...
- Yeah. Come on.

1371
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:21,120
But not you. It's girl stuff.
You'd hate it.

1372
01:14:21,156 --> 01:14:23,716
- But...
- Come on.

1373
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:25,351
Um, OK. Will I, uh...

1374
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:27,624
...are these shoes OK
for what we're gonna do?

1375
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:30,931
I can't believe this is happening.

1376
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,560
My mother made this dress by hand.

1377
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:38,369
In this very shop. In 1929.

1378
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:41,399
It's funny how things
come back in style.

1379
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:43,434
Just... just
finishing up the buttons.

1380
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,208
Yeah, and don't worry about the fit

1381
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:48,273
because Annie is the best
tailor in southeast Alaska.

1382
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:49,341
Oh... Pssh.

1383
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:53,277
Wow, incredible.

1384
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,882
Maybe a tad loose in certain
areas, but otherwise...

1385
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:59,655
Oh, sorry. I'm a bit
chesty to begin with

1386
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:02,391
and I happened to be
knocked up when I wore this.

1387
01:15:02,431 --> 01:15:03,762
Oh.

1388
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:07,098
Oh, let's see if we can find your boobs.

1389
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:12,265
- They're in there somewhere.
- Yes. Yes, they are.

1390
01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:14,138
This is like an Easter egg hunt.

1391
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:17,801
Maybe they shrunk up
in the cold Alaskan air.

1392
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:24,684
- Oh! There they are.
- That... yes. That would be...

1393
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:28,247
- There, let's see.
- I was thinking, if you'd like,

1394
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:33,023
maybe we could head down your
way for the holidays this year.

1395
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:35,256
Oh, that would, uh...
that would be nice.

1396
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:39,791
That'd be nice. Or maybe
we could come to you, too.

1397
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:43,566
- Well, that would be lovely.
- Mmm-hmm.

1398
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:45,766
I would like that very much.

1399
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:48,605
Oh, Grace, for God's sake.
We've got work to do.

1400
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:51,442
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Go make yourself a cup of tea.

1401
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:54,313
I'll finish this. Go.

1402
01:15:54,349 --> 01:16:00,288
Now, let's make this
absolute perfection.

1403
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:07,986
Now, just one special touch
and you're ready.

1404
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:16,534
It's been in the family
for more than 150 years.

1405
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,540
Annie, it's beautiful,
but I don't really think...

1406
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:21,236
- Shh. I'm not finished.
- Oh, sorry.

1407
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:24,768
My great-grandfather gave it
to my great-grandmother

1408
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:26,974
when they got married.

1409
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:29,074
They were quite a scandal, you know.

1410
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:33,076
He was Russian and she
was Tlingit, and back then

1411
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:35,919
you had to get approval
from every member of the tribe

1412
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:37,289
before you got married.

1413
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:38,884
Almost broke them up.

1414
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:41,862
Well... how did they stay together then?

1415
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:44,593
She was a lot like you. Tough.

1416
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:47,568
Wouldn't take "no" for an answer.

1417
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:51,471
She was good for him.

1418
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:53,269
I want you to have it.

1419
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:56,800
- I can't. Can't take this.
- I don't want to hear it.

1420
01:16:56,845 --> 01:17:00,474
Grandmothers love to give
their stuff to their grandchildren.

1421
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:03,245
It makes us feel like we'll
still be part of your lives

1422
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:04,684
even after we're gone.

1423
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,915
Take it.

1424
01:17:12,227 --> 01:17:15,594
Are... are you all right, dear?

1425
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:19,594
I, uh...

1426
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:24,071
Uh... Well, I, um...

1427
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:31,975
I, uh... I just, uh, I just wanted to...

1428
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:34,778
make sure there was enough time
to get all the sewing done.

1429
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:37,785
Don't you worry about that.

1430
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:40,287
- You're gonna be beautiful.
- OK.

1431
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:43,917
- Now let's get you out of those pins.
- OK.

1432
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:08,175
All right.

1433
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:17,692
This is untied. Hop on in.

1434
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:22,462
Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1435
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:24,564
Whoa! What...

1436
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:26,157
Mind telling me what the hell's wrong?

1437
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:27,896
I just needed to get
away from everybody.

1438
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:29,961
- What's wrong?
- Nothing! Just stop talking, please!

1439
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:41,974
Would you mind telling me
what's happening now?

1440
01:18:42,017 --> 01:18:43,484
Margaret.

1441
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:48,646
- Margaret!
- I forgot, OK?

1442
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:49,884
You forgot what?

1443
01:18:49,925 --> 01:18:52,485
I forgot what it was
like to have a family!

1444
01:18:52,527 --> 01:18:54,893
I've been on my own since I was 16

1445
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:57,865
and I forgot what it felt
like to have people love you

1446
01:18:57,899 --> 01:19:00,163
and make you breakfast and say, "Hey!

1447
01:19:00,202 --> 01:19:01,794
We'd love to come down
for the holidays. "

1448
01:19:01,837 --> 01:19:05,329
And I say, "Well, why don't we
come up and see you instead?"

1449
01:19:05,373 --> 01:19:07,864
And give you necklaces!
And you have all that here,

1450
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:10,571
and you have Gertrude, and
I'm... I'm just screwing it up!

1451
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:12,842
You're not screwing it up!
I agreed to this!

1452
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:13,939
You were there, remember?

1453
01:19:13,982 --> 01:19:15,540
Your family loves you. Do you know that?

1454
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,142
- I know that! Yes!
- You know that?

1455
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:18,846
And you're still willing
to put them through this?

1456
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:19,911
They're not gonna find out!

1457
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:21,252
How do you know they won't find out?

1458
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:22,620
Because you said so yourself.

1459
01:19:22,657 --> 01:19:24,625
- I know, but what if your mother...
- You said so yourself!

1460
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:25,853
Oh, my God, if your mother found out...

1461
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:27,919
Whoa! Whoa!

1462
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:29,590
- Oh, my God! What if Gammy finds out?
- The boat is moving!

1463
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:31,064
If Gammy finds out, she's
gonna have a heart attack!

1464
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:33,033
Stop! It's gonna be fine!

1465
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:35,298
- She's gonna have a heart attack!
- Will you calm down! Hold on!

1466
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:37,762
Whoa, whoa. Whoa!

1467
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:41,435
Whoa! I don't think
that hijacking a boat

1468
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:45,071
is a proper way to
express your frustration!

1469
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:46,478
Now... Oh, great.

1470
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:48,847
Now you decide to shut up! Margaret?

1471
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:50,943
- Andrew!
- Margaret?

1472
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:53,648
- Andrew!
- Margaret!

1473
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:58,517
I can't swim!

1474
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,084
Margaret!

1475
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:01,390
To the buoy!

1476
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:03,897
- What?
- To the buoy!

1477
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:05,824
OK.

1478
01:20:19,114 --> 01:20:21,480
All right, come on! Give me your hand!

1479
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:23,984
Hey! Give me your hand!

1480
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:26,715
Margaret! Give me...

1481
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:28,279
Come on, give me your hand!

1482
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:29,813
Come on, come on. I got you. I got you.

1483
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:32,349
I got you.

1484
01:20:33,595 --> 01:20:35,995
Come on.

1485
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:37,862
What the hell
were you thinking?

1486
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:39,560
Could've gotten yourself killed.

1487
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:43,002
You turned the boat and
made me fall in, you jackass.

1488
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:45,063
You let go of the steering wheel, Ahab.

1489
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:47,734
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1490
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:51,075
All right, come here.
You've got to get warm. Come on.

1491
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:55,674
Come on. It's OK.

1492
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:56,877
That's OK.

1493
01:21:00,288 --> 01:21:01,516
It's OK.

1494
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:35,078
I want to talk to both of you.

1495
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:50,797
Your mother is never to
hear about any of this.

1496
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:05,109
Told you I'd check up on you.

1497
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:07,849
What did you do?

1498
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:09,789
I got a phone call from
Mr. Gilbertson here,

1499
01:22:09,824 --> 01:22:12,088
who told me that if you were lying,

1500
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:14,357
and he strongly believes that you are,

1501
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:15,920
he would send you to prison.

1502
01:22:15,964 --> 01:22:18,057
So I flew him up here.

1503
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:20,124
- Dad.
- Luckily for you,

1504
01:22:20,168 --> 01:22:23,194
your father negotiated
a deal on your behalf.

1505
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:26,469
Now, this offer's
gonna last for 20 seconds,

1506
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:28,237
so listen closely.

1507
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:29,368
You're gonna make a statement

1508
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:31,072
admitting this marriage is a sham...

1509
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:32,409
...or you're gonna go to prison.

1510
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:34,677
You tell the truth, you're off the hook,

1511
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:37,480
and she is going to go back to Canada.

1512
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:45,689
Ah, well. Take the deal.

1513
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:50,130
- I don't think so.
- Don't be stupid, Andrew.

1514
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:51,962
You want a statement?
Here's your statement.

1515
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,661
I've been working for
Margaret Tate for three years.

1516
01:22:53,702 --> 01:22:56,000
Six months ago we started
dating, we fell in love.

1517
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:57,902
I asked her to marry me, she said "yes. "

1518
01:22:57,939 --> 01:23:00,134
I'll see you at the wedding.

1519
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,411
Well, you know.

1520
01:23:33,742 --> 01:23:37,701
So...

1521
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:40,408
...you sure about this?

1522
01:23:40,448 --> 01:23:42,006
Not really.

1523
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:48,553
I mean, I am very appreciative
of what you've done,

1524
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:49,614
but I think that...

1525
01:23:49,657 --> 01:23:50,851
You'd do the same for me.

1526
01:23:50,892 --> 01:23:52,519
Right?

1527
01:23:53,928 --> 01:23:56,260
Hope everyone is decent.

1528
01:23:56,297 --> 01:23:57,787
You need to come with me.

1529
01:23:57,832 --> 01:23:59,527
Now, tomorrow
is your wedding day.

1530
01:23:59,567 --> 01:24:01,228
You have to give the
Baby Maker a rest tonight.

1531
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:03,032
It's tradition.

1532
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:05,062
- Give your bride a kiss good night.
- We're not gonna...

1533
01:24:05,106 --> 01:24:06,334
...use the Baby Maker.

1534
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:08,103
You've got your whole
lives to be together.

1535
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:10,941
- OK.
- Now, come on. Come on.

1536
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:19,447
If I don't go with her,
she's just gonna...

1537
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:23,389
- Come right back.
- Yeah.

1538
01:24:30,365 --> 01:24:31,730
See you in the morning?

1539
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:34,200
Yeah.

1540
01:25:37,232 --> 01:25:38,324
Hey, Gammy.

1541
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:41,898
- Thanks, Gammy.
- Oh.

1542
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:53,063
Everyone, please be seated.

1543
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,071
Ramone.

1544
01:27:04,018 --> 01:27:08,751
We are gathered here
today to give thanks...

1545
01:27:09,724 --> 01:27:12,352
...and to celebrate...

1546
01:27:12,393 --> 01:27:14,953
...one of life's greatest moments.

1547
01:27:14,996 --> 01:27:16,827
To give recognition

1548
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:21,631
to the beauty, honesty,
and unselfish ways

1549
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:24,467
of Andrew and Margaret's true love

1550
01:27:24,505 --> 01:27:26,973
in front of family and friends.

1551
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:29,909
For it is their family and friends

1552
01:27:29,944 --> 01:27:34,244
who taught Andrew and Margaret to love.

1553
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:39,049
So it is only right that
family and friends are all...

1554
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:44,787
<i>Mi amor. Do you have a question?</i>

1555
01:27:45,627 --> 01:27:47,595
Uh, no...

1556
01:27:47,629 --> 01:27:49,119
Your hand is up.

1557
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:55,726
Oh, it, it's, uh, not a question,

1558
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:58,034
but I do have something I need to say.

1559
01:27:58,072 --> 01:28:02,008
- Margaret.
- Can it wait till after?

1560
01:28:02,043 --> 01:28:06,571
Uh... No. No.

1561
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:21,861
- Hi there.
- Hi.

1562
01:28:21,896 --> 01:28:24,057
Thank you all so much for coming out.

1563
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:27,261
I, uh... have
a bit of an announcement

1564
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:29,429
to make about the wedding.

1565
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:32,769
- A confession, actually.
- What are you doing?

1566
01:28:32,807 --> 01:28:36,368
Uh... I'm a Canadian. Yes, Canadian.

1567
01:28:36,411 --> 01:28:40,575
With an expired visa
who was about to be deported.

1568
01:28:40,615 --> 01:28:42,276
And because I didn't want to leave

1569
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:44,547
this wonderful country of yours,

1570
01:28:44,585 --> 01:28:47,520
I forced Andrew here to marry me.

1571
01:28:47,555 --> 01:28:48,988
Margaret, stop it.

1572
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:52,891
See, Andrew has always had
this extraordinary work ethic.

1573
01:28:54,362 --> 01:28:56,023
Something I think he learned from you.

1574
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:59,391
And for three years I
watched him work harder

1575
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:01,402
than anyone else at our company.

1576
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:04,701
And I knew that if I threatened
to destroy his career...

1577
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:07,936
...he would, he would do
just about anything.

1578
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:15,539
So I blackmailed him to
come up here and to lie to you.

1579
01:29:17,685 --> 01:29:20,711
All of you.

1580
01:29:20,755 --> 01:29:23,485
And I thought it would
be easy to watch him do it.

1581
01:29:25,626 --> 01:29:27,184
But it wasn't.

1582
01:29:30,064 --> 01:29:32,225
Turns out it's not easy
to ruin someone's life

1583
01:29:32,266 --> 01:29:34,894
once you find out
how wonderful they are.

1584
01:29:41,142 --> 01:29:43,167
You have a beautiful family.

1585
01:29:45,012 --> 01:29:47,139
Don't let this
come between you.

1586
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:52,482
This was my fault.

1587
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,351
Margaret...

1588
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:56,289
Andrew, this was a business deal,

1589
01:29:56,324 --> 01:30:00,351
and you held up your end,
but now the deal is off.

1590
01:30:01,629 --> 01:30:02,926
I'm sorry.

1591
01:30:04,832 --> 01:30:06,060
And, you, meet me at the dock.

1592
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:07,897
You're giving me a ride to the airport.

1593
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:27,210
- What were you thinking?
- I don't, I don't know.

1594
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:28,847
Andrew, you lied to us.

1595
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:30,289
Let me get my head on straight, OK?

1596
01:30:30,324 --> 01:30:31,723
I'll explain everything later.

1597
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:34,091
I'm sorry.

1598
01:31:11,499 --> 01:31:14,366
<i>You were right.
This book is special.</i>

1599
01:31:14,402 --> 01:31:16,029
<i>I lied because I knew publishing meant</i>

1600
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:17,332
<i>I'd lose you as an assistant</i>

1601
01:31:17,371 --> 01:31:19,601
<i>but... you have an extraordinary eye,</i>

1602
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:22,666
<i>and I'll make sure we
buy this before I leave.</i>

1603
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:26,840
<i>Have an amazing life.
You deserve it. Margaret.</i>

1604
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:32,314
<i>Well, that was, uh... crazy.</i>

1605
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:36,155
You know, people are gonna be
talking about this forever.

1606
01:31:38,059 --> 01:31:39,686
Yeah. Yeah.

1607
01:31:41,395 --> 01:31:42,521
Are you OK?

1608
01:31:43,764 --> 01:31:46,631
Yeah. No. Uh...

1609
01:31:48,803 --> 01:31:52,671
I just feel... You know
what the problem is?

1610
01:31:52,707 --> 01:31:55,904
The problem is that this woman...

1611
01:31:55,943 --> 01:31:59,470
...is a gigantic pain in my ass.

1612
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:01,982
First there's the whole leaving
thing. I understand that.

1613
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:04,814
It's a sham wedding.
It's kind of stressful.

1614
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:07,878
But then she goes ahead
and she leaves this note.

1615
01:32:07,922 --> 01:32:09,787
Because she doesn't have the decency...

1616
01:32:09,824 --> 01:32:11,951
the humanity to do it to my face.

1617
01:32:11,993 --> 01:32:17,090
Three years. Three years
I work with this... this terrorist.

1618
01:32:17,131 --> 01:32:18,723
Never once has she had
a nice thing to say,

1619
01:32:18,766 --> 01:32:20,631
and then she goes ahead
and she writes this crap!

1620
01:32:20,668 --> 01:32:22,431
- Andrew.
- But none of that matters

1621
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:23,698
because we had a deal!

1622
01:32:23,738 --> 01:32:27,936
- Andrew.
- Sorry. I'm sorry. I just...

1623
01:32:27,975 --> 01:32:29,169
<i>She just makes me a little crazy.</i>

1624
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:32,646
Yeah. I can see that.

1625
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:36,741
So you're just gonna let her go?

1626
01:32:50,031 --> 01:32:51,999
So, what now?

1627
01:32:52,033 --> 01:32:55,002
Well... now that
you're leaving voluntarily,

1628
01:32:55,036 --> 01:32:57,732
<i>it all becomes very civilized.</i>

1629
01:32:57,772 --> 01:33:00,536
Once we land in New York,
you have 24 hours

1630
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:03,601
to head back to Canada.

1631
01:33:10,985 --> 01:33:13,317
- Andrew, what's happening?
- I got to talk to her.

1632
01:33:13,354 --> 01:33:14,582
- Why would you do that?
- Boys!

1633
01:33:14,622 --> 01:33:15,646
This has nothing to do with you.

1634
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:16,714
Boys, stop it! Stop it!

1635
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:18,247
I'm not gonna let you do this.

1636
01:33:18,292 --> 01:33:19,759
I'm not asking
your permission here.

1637
01:33:19,794 --> 01:33:22,991
Annie! Joe! Joe!

1638
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:26,227
Annie! Joe!

1639
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:29,259
I think I'm having a heart attack.

1640
01:33:29,303 --> 01:33:30,736
- Easy. Easy.
- Somebody get a doctor!

1641
01:33:30,771 --> 01:33:32,602
- Easy, easy.
- Get a doctor!

1642
01:33:36,644 --> 01:33:37,736
I got it.

1643
01:34:06,273 --> 01:34:08,002
Andrew.

1644
01:34:10,578 --> 01:34:13,979
You two need to stop fighting.

1645
01:34:14,015 --> 01:34:16,677
You'll never see eye to eye.

1646
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:21,614
But you're family.

1647
01:34:24,959 --> 01:34:29,896
Promise me you'll stand by Andrew.

1648
01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:32,797
Even if... if you don't agree with him.

1649
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:36,534
I promise.

1650
01:34:38,472 --> 01:34:40,906
Andrew.

1651
01:34:40,941 --> 01:34:46,902
Promise me you'll work harder
to be a part of this family.

1652
01:34:46,947 --> 01:34:48,972
I will.

1653
01:34:51,619 --> 01:34:53,951
I will, Gammy.

1654
01:34:53,988 --> 01:34:59,620
Well, then, the spirits can take me.

1655
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:01,423
Oh, Annie.

1656
01:35:08,169 --> 01:35:09,830
Gammy?

1657
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:18,039
I guess they're not ready for me.

1658
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:21,111
I'm feeling much better, sonny.

1659
01:35:21,148 --> 01:35:23,048
No need to take us
to the hospital.

1660
01:35:23,084 --> 01:35:24,881
Take us to the airport, please.

1661
01:35:24,919 --> 01:35:26,750
Mom, what? Are you faking
the heart attack?

1662
01:35:26,787 --> 01:35:28,220
Oh, come on!

1663
01:35:28,255 --> 01:35:30,086
Well, it was the only
way I could get you two

1664
01:35:30,124 --> 01:35:32,524
to shut up and get us to the airport!

1665
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,619
<i>Ma'am, we're not authorized
to take you to the airport.</i>

1666
01:35:34,662 --> 01:35:37,631
Larry Ferris, don't
make me call your mother.

1667
01:35:37,665 --> 01:35:39,826
You got it.

1668
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:43,700
You scared the hell out of me.

1669
01:35:48,809 --> 01:35:52,870
Yep. You should've
given up back in New York.

1670
01:35:52,913 --> 01:35:56,144
See, I'm like Eliot Ness.

1671
01:35:56,183 --> 01:35:59,277
I always get my man.

1672
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:02,346
I'm that good.

1673
01:36:02,389 --> 01:36:04,516
Flight 1601, as soon
as you're in position,

1674
01:36:04,558 --> 01:36:05,855
you're cleared for takeoff.

1675
01:36:05,893 --> 01:36:07,019
<i>Roger that, Chuck.</i>

1676
01:36:15,069 --> 01:36:16,969
OK. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1677
01:36:23,177 --> 01:36:24,735
Tower. Talk to me.

1678
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:26,872
<i>- Chuck! It's Drew Paxton.
- Hey, dude.</i>

1679
01:36:26,914 --> 01:36:29,906
Hey, uh... I have a little
favor I need from you, buddy...

1680
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:32,009
Margaret's on that plane. I got
to talk to her. Can you stop it?

1681
01:36:32,052 --> 01:36:33,349
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

1682
01:36:33,387 --> 01:36:35,150
I heard about your lady bailin'.

1683
01:36:35,189 --> 01:36:38,215
<i>- Drag-ola.
- Chuck! I need you</i>

1684
01:36:38,259 --> 01:36:39,783
to stop the plane. Please.

1685
01:36:39,827 --> 01:36:42,694
<i>I can't do that.</i>

1686
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:46,063
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no! Come on!

1687
01:36:46,867 --> 01:36:48,266
Oh, no.

1688
01:36:50,437 --> 01:36:52,132
No!

1689
01:36:53,908 --> 01:36:55,808
- What's wrong?
- Margaret's on that plane.

1690
01:36:55,843 --> 01:36:58,107
- And he didn't get to tell her.
- Tell her what?

1691
01:36:58,145 --> 01:36:59,612
That he loves her.

1692
01:36:59,647 --> 01:37:02,480
So she could tell him
that she loves him, too.

1693
01:37:02,516 --> 01:37:03,676
OK, but how does he...

1694
01:37:03,717 --> 01:37:05,082
If she didn't love him,
she wouldn't have left.

1695
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:06,609
Of course not.

1696
01:37:06,654 --> 01:37:08,178
Am I the only one not getting this?

1697
01:37:08,222 --> 01:37:12,090
- Oh, Joe!
- Chuck! Chuck! Look down.

1698
01:37:12,126 --> 01:37:13,593
Oh! Oh. Look down.

1699
01:37:13,627 --> 01:37:15,925
<i>Like... Oh, there you are!</i>

1700
01:37:15,963 --> 01:37:18,090
<i>Sorry, man. There was
nothing I could do.</i>

1701
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:21,761
Thanks, Chuck.

1702
01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:29,105
I'm sorry, son. I didn't
know how you felt about her.

1703
01:37:34,315 --> 01:37:35,907
Honey, it's gonna be OK.

1704
01:38:09,383 --> 01:38:10,850
Jordan?

1705
01:38:29,169 --> 01:38:30,193
Jordan.

1706
01:38:31,572 --> 01:38:33,039
Jordan!

1707
01:38:33,073 --> 01:38:36,406
I need for you to send
the boxes in my office to...

1708
01:38:36,443 --> 01:38:38,035
...to this address, please.

1709
01:38:38,078 --> 01:38:42,412
This one right here.
This address right here. OK?

1710
01:38:42,449 --> 01:38:45,009
- Can you do that?
- Uh, yes. Sure.

1711
01:38:45,052 --> 01:38:46,917
- Good, all right. Thank you.
- Miss Tate.

1712
01:38:46,954 --> 01:38:50,151
Yes. What? What?

1713
01:38:52,026 --> 01:38:55,393
Hey.

1714
01:38:56,764 --> 01:38:59,392
Andrew.

1715
01:39:03,203 --> 01:39:05,831
Why are, why are you panting?

1716
01:39:05,873 --> 01:39:08,034
Because I've been running.

1717
01:39:08,075 --> 01:39:10,908
- Really. From Alaska?
- I need to talk to you.

1718
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:12,640
Yeah? Well, I don't have time to talk.

1719
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:15,080
I need to catch a 5:45 to Toronto.

1720
01:39:15,115 --> 01:39:16,810
- Margaret.
- I need the boxes to go out today.

1721
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:17,908
I want to make sure everything is...

1722
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:20,045
Margaret! Stop talking!

1723
01:39:24,158 --> 01:39:25,648
Gotta say something.

1724
01:39:25,693 --> 01:39:27,388
- OK.
- This will just take a sec.

1725
01:39:27,428 --> 01:39:29,328
Fine. What?

1726
01:39:30,331 --> 01:39:35,064
Three days ago, I loathed you.

1727
01:39:35,102 --> 01:39:37,297
I used to dream about you
getting hit by a cab.

1728
01:39:37,338 --> 01:39:38,635
Or poisoned.

1729
01:39:38,672 --> 01:39:42,267
- Oh, that's nice.
- I told you to stop talking.

1730
01:39:42,309 --> 01:39:44,903
Then we had our little
adventure up in Alaska

1731
01:39:44,945 --> 01:39:47,311
and things started to change.

1732
01:39:47,348 --> 01:39:50,010
Things changed when we kissed.

1733
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:53,920
And when you told me about your tattoo.

1734
01:39:56,557 --> 01:39:58,752
Even when you checked me
out when we were naked.

1735
01:39:58,792 --> 01:40:00,157
Uh-huuuh.

1736
01:40:00,194 --> 01:40:01,320
Naked?

1737
01:40:01,362 --> 01:40:03,330
Well, I didn't see anything...

1738
01:40:03,364 --> 01:40:04,729
Yeah, you did.

1739
01:40:04,765 --> 01:40:09,031
<i>But I didn't realize any of
this until I was standing alone.</i>

1740
01:40:09,069 --> 01:40:12,869
In a barn... wife-less.

1741
01:40:12,906 --> 01:40:15,534
Now, you can imagine my disappointment

1742
01:40:15,576 --> 01:40:17,043
when it suddenly dawned on me

1743
01:40:17,077 --> 01:40:21,377
that the woman I love is about
to be kicked out of the country.

1744
01:40:23,984 --> 01:40:25,815
So, Margaret.

1745
01:40:28,055 --> 01:40:29,181
Marry me.

1746
01:40:32,626 --> 01:40:35,117
Because I'd like to date you.

1747
01:40:47,341 --> 01:40:50,674
Trust me. You don't really
want to be with me.

1748
01:40:50,711 --> 01:40:52,440
Yes, I do.

1749
01:40:54,081 --> 01:40:57,073
See, the thing is, there is a reason why

1750
01:40:57,117 --> 01:40:59,711
I've been alone all this time.

1751
01:40:59,753 --> 01:41:01,721
I'm comfortable that way.

1752
01:41:01,755 --> 01:41:03,780
And I think it would
just be a lot easier

1753
01:41:03,824 --> 01:41:09,854
if we forgot everything
that happened and I just left.

1754
01:41:11,732 --> 01:41:13,324
You're right.

1755
01:41:18,839 --> 01:41:21,433
That would be easier.

1756
01:41:37,224 --> 01:41:40,682
- I'm scared.
- Me, too.

1757
01:42:04,551 --> 01:42:07,486
Aren't you supposed to get down
on your knee or something?

1758
01:42:07,521 --> 01:42:09,045
I'm gonna take that as a "yes. "

1759
01:42:09,089 --> 01:42:11,114
Oh, OK.

1760
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:28,574
Yeah! Show her
who's boss, Andrew!

1761
01:42:36,683 --> 01:42:40,312
So, let me see
if I've got this right.

1762
01:42:40,354 --> 01:42:42,788
You two are engaged again.

1763
01:42:42,823 --> 01:42:44,381
- Yes.
- Yes.

1764
01:42:44,424 --> 01:42:46,517
For real?

1765
01:42:47,461 --> 01:42:48,621
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1766
01:42:48,662 --> 01:42:49,720
You're sure you want to
go through with this?

1767
01:42:49,763 --> 01:42:50,889
Because one wrong answer...

1768
01:42:50,931 --> 01:42:54,128
I'm gonna take you down.

1769
01:42:56,503 --> 01:42:59,199
- OK.
- OK.

1770
01:43:00,841 --> 01:43:02,138
Let's do it.

1771
01:43:11,585 --> 01:43:13,109
When did you
first start to date?

1772
01:43:13,153 --> 01:43:15,018
Last week.

1773
01:43:15,055 --> 01:43:18,286
- That going well?
- So far it's great. Thank you.

1774
01:43:18,325 --> 01:43:19,815
What kind of
deodorant does Andrew use?

1775
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:21,418
Men's Speed Stick?

1776
01:43:21,461 --> 01:43:24,760
What flavor? Musk? Alpine?

1777
01:43:24,798 --> 01:43:26,095
Was it love at first sight?

1778
01:43:26,133 --> 01:43:28,260
No.

1779
01:43:28,302 --> 01:43:32,136
I loved her from the beginning.

1780
01:43:32,172 --> 01:43:33,434
What side of the
bed does Margaret sleep on?

1781
01:43:33,473 --> 01:43:35,202
She sleeps on the left.

1782
01:43:35,242 --> 01:43:36,675
What side of the bed do you sleep on?

1783
01:43:38,712 --> 01:43:43,046
Look, are they soul mates? Eeeh.

1784
01:43:43,083 --> 01:43:45,711
Uh... Will they kill each other? No.

1785
01:43:45,752 --> 01:43:46,878
Are you a good driver?

1786
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:49,514
Oh, excellent driver. Excellent.

1787
01:43:53,293 --> 01:43:55,693
Oh.

1788
01:43:55,729 --> 01:43:58,721
In my mind I see her
with someone perhaps...

1789
01:43:58,765 --> 01:44:00,665
...more swarthy, darker.

1790
01:44:00,701 --> 01:44:03,329
We don't use the word
"Margaret" around Kevin.

1791
01:44:03,370 --> 01:44:07,670
He still hasn't warmed up to her.

1792
01:44:07,708 --> 01:44:11,434
Margaret.

1793
01:44:11,478 --> 01:44:13,207
See? It's the damnedest thing.

1794
01:44:13,247 --> 01:44:14,874
I have never farted in front of him.

1795
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:17,315
Nor will I ever fart in front of him.

1796
01:44:17,351 --> 01:44:19,876
She farts in her sleep.

1797
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,820
Would you consider
Margaret a good dancer?

1798
01:44:21,855 --> 01:44:25,086
You can tell by the way
she drinks her soda pop

1799
01:44:25,125 --> 01:44:27,491
that she's a good dancer.

1800
01:44:27,527 --> 01:44:28,755
Uh-huh. How, how...

1801
01:44:28,795 --> 01:44:33,232
How is the soda pop
relevant to the dancing?

1802
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:34,928
I don't understand this.

1803
01:44:34,968 --> 01:44:37,903
- I call him... puppy.
- Pumpkin.

1804
01:44:37,938 --> 01:44:39,599
- Monkey.
- Daisy.

1805
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:41,835
- Kiddo.
- Uh... Bird.

1806
01:44:41,875 --> 01:44:45,072
Sometimes I call him Rick.

1807
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:46,579
How do you spell "Ramone?"

1808
01:44:46,613 --> 01:44:49,480
R- A-M-O-N-E.

1809
01:44:49,516 --> 01:44:51,416
Could you do that
again in English, please?

1810
01:44:51,451 --> 01:44:54,318
When you say, you know, the
position in the relationship...

1811
01:44:54,354 --> 01:44:55,719
Top or bottom?

1812
01:44:55,756 --> 01:44:58,725
You're asking me a question
about who's on top?

1813
01:44:58,759 --> 01:45:00,488
You took an oath
when you walked in this office.

1814
01:45:00,527 --> 01:45:02,995
I did not take an oath.
When did I take an oath?

1815
01:45:03,030 --> 01:45:04,292
Laura should've
done that, but she didn't.

1816
01:45:04,331 --> 01:45:06,196
- That's OK.
- Who's Laura?

1817
01:45:06,233 --> 01:45:08,565
She's the girl behind you.
Don't look around.

1818
01:45:08,602 --> 01:45:09,864
Which of
the following numbers

1819
01:45:09,903 --> 01:45:12,701
- is not a prime?
- Seventeen.

1820
01:45:12,739 --> 01:45:14,900
I'm sorry. Let me say the list, please.

1821
01:45:14,941 --> 01:45:15,965
I'm sorry?

1822
01:45:16,009 --> 01:45:17,271
He knew
your favorite color.

1823
01:45:17,311 --> 01:45:18,938
- Blue?
- Wrong!

1824
01:45:18,979 --> 01:45:20,503
- Red?
- No!

1825
01:45:20,547 --> 01:45:22,071
Dark... Maybe like a hunter green?

1826
01:45:22,115 --> 01:45:23,514
No. White.

1827
01:45:23,550 --> 01:45:24,812
- White?
- OK, moving on.

1828
01:45:24,851 --> 01:45:26,250
Favorite color is blue.

1829
01:45:26,286 --> 01:45:30,188
What's her favorite color
when she's not at home?

1830
01:45:30,223 --> 01:45:31,622
I don't know.

1831
01:45:31,658 --> 01:45:33,421
<i>Are you a citizen
of this country, Ramone?</i>

1832
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:37,328
<i>Yes, I'm a citizen!
Are you crazy?</i>

1833
01:45:39,366 --> 01:45:42,267
What relevance a ball in a net

1834
01:45:42,302 --> 01:45:44,236
or a Fruit Roll-Up or a Pop-Tart

1835
01:45:44,271 --> 01:45:46,831
has to do with my
relationship with Andrew?

1836
01:45:46,873 --> 01:45:48,397
If you're
getting excited...

1837
01:45:48,442 --> 01:45:51,570
Who are you engaged to?

1838
01:45:51,611 --> 01:45:55,809
- Andrew.
- Very good. Got one right.

1839
01:45:55,849 --> 01:45:57,009
Who are you engaged to?

1840
01:45:57,050 --> 01:45:58,745
I'm engaged to Margaret Tate.

1841
01:45:58,785 --> 01:46:04,246
And on the wedding day,
who will be next to you?

1842
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:06,589
I'm going to marry Margaret Tate.

1843
01:46:06,626 --> 01:46:09,322
- Final answer?
- That work? Yeah, final answer.

1844
01:46:09,363 --> 01:46:12,662
Is this a game show?
I don't understand what...

1845
01:46:19,773 --> 01:46:21,240
That's a great song.

1846
01:46:21,274 --> 01:46:23,003
That was beautiful.
That was really beautiful.

1847
01:46:23,043 --> 01:46:24,704
Mama Cass.
