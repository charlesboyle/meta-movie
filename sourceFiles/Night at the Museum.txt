Ah, all right!

That wasn't a compliment.

00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,465
Care to elaborate on that?

100
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:59,869
Sure. Well, that was the umbrella

No, no. That's the Clapper...

of the population...

Dead?

You've been in there 54 years!
You're not getting out tonight!

502
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,717

of all this commotion.

<i>The Tablet of Ahkmenrah.</i>

<i>On that night...</i>

506
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:21,495
everything in this museum
came to life.

507

And every night since.

508
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:32,014
So everything in the museum
comes to life every night?

509
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,107
Exactly.

510
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:37,051

511
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:39,145
You're the night watchman,

512
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,384

- All right. Okay.

it can be done.

Hence, the 20-foot jackal staring at you
right now. Don't make eye contact!

518
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:57,068
Your job is to make sure that
everyone stays inside the museum...

519
00:37:57,174 --> 00:38:01,838
because if the sun rises and anyone's
on the outside, we turn to dust.

520
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,710
- You turn to dust?
- Dust.

521
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,715
- Really?
- Really.

522
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:10,309
Now it's almost dawn.
I shall help you restore order tonight.

523

But mark my words, it's the last time
I shall ever do so. Is that clear?

Yeah. I mean—

- Well— Oh, actually, I gotta be honest.

- What? You've only just begun.

- What did you do before you took this post?

537
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,743
Uh, well, I've done
a lot of different things.

538
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,047
I, um— I invented this thing
called the Snapper.

539
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:19,122
Did you give up on that as well?

540
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,521
No. I didn't.
No, I just hit a few roadblocks.

- You might've heard of the Clapper.

- Yes, sir.
- Some men are born great.

543

Others have greatness
thrust upon them.

For you, this is that very moment.
