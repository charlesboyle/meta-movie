should say it just...

you about John Murtha.

Go ahead. The prosecutor's
gonna go after him.

I'm on the other side of that issue.

174
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,948
Ethics? Yeah!

175
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,925
Well, the Speaker would like to
put you on the committee anyway.

176
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:51,521
Okay. Well, if anyone asks what the
hell I'm doing on the Ethics Committee,

177
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,327
we'll just tell them I like
chasing women and drinking whiskey

178
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,527
and the Speaker felt we
were underrepresented.

179
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,263
One man, one vote. Exactly.

180
00:08:58,337 --> 00:08:59,702
Tip's gonna want to return the favor.

181
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,706
Tuesday, right? That is Tuesday, yes.

182
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,332
So if anything comes
up that you'd like me

183
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,501
to speak with him about, please...

184
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,635
Yes.

185
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,170
Yes!

186
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,341
I'd like to be on the Board of
Directors of the Kennedy Center.

187
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:11,473
Charlie. I'm sorry?

188
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,543
Turns out Congress appoints the Board
of Directors of the Kennedy Center.

189
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,556
It's a great place to take a date,
and I can never afford the tickets.

190
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,489
Consider it done. Excellent.

191
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,518
Go vote.

192
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,564
Another few minutes. Let's
see what's on the wires.

193
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,327
Why can't you wait for
newspapers like everybody else?

194
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,665
'Cause I think it's productive
to know today's news today.

195
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,296
And it makes me one day smarter
than you, which I enjoy as well.

196
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,862
I know you do.

197
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,408
You don't think that's a little crazy?

198
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,636
Pan Am and Eastern are
lowering their fares.

199
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,576
'Cause of Braniff.
What's a little crazy?

200
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,079
Joining the Board of the Kennedy Center

201
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,082
so you can get free tickets
to the Royal Ballet of...

202
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,242
Hold on. What?

204
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,484

205

Afghanistan.

206
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,348
Russia, Afghanistan, Pakistan,
Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,

207
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,292
Jordan, Israel, Egypt.

208
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,290
Jim Van Wagenen's our
point man on black approps

209
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,732
for the Defense Subcommittee?

210
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:03,860
Yeah.

211
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,166
Have him come to my
office as soon as possible.

212
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:07,705
How am I voting on this? BONNIE: Yes.

213
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,933
You sure? Yes.

214
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,498
The Boy Scouts?

215
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,170
Jim Van Wagenen. Get him
and show him that wire story.

216
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,076
Yes, sir. You are the
man I wanted to talk to.

217
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,245
The Congressman will
be here in a moment.

218
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,012
He's just coming up from a vote.

219
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,553
I'm sure it's an important one.

220
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,747
No. Not really.

221
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,246
SUZANNE: So, Marla, can you fit
this into his schedule next week?

222

(PHONE RINGING)

Wilson's office. Good morning.

224

The third...

225
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,592
It is? How are you?

226
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:32,961
BONNIE: Suzanne, can you
help me with this? Okay.

227
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,863
SUZANNE: I'll be right back.
RECEPTIONIST: I'll have him do it.

228
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:35,923
Okay, bye-bye.

229
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,367
LARRY: Miss? Yes, sir?

230
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:41,702
It seems to me, looking around, that
it's almost all women working here,

231
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,174
and that they're all very pretty.

232
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,399
Is that common?

233
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,570
(LAUGHS) Well,

234
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,876
Congressman Wilson,
he has an expression.

235
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:53,612
He says, "You can teach them to type,
but you can't teach them to grow tits."

236
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,218
Well, that's charming.

237
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,982
Larry! Congressman!

238
00:10:57,056 --> 00:11:00,890
No, no, no. For $5,000 every two
years you get to call me Charlie.

239
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,828
And for 10,000, you can call me Betty
Sue and I'll clean out your rain gutters.

240
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:05,921
This is my daughter, Jane.

241
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,260
Well, now I remember
Jane. Two-L at SMU.

242
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,925
Charlie Wilson's office. Good morning.

243
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,628
Welcome to the United States Congress.

244
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,035
Hey, I'm gonna talk to your
daddy for a couple of seconds.

245
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,266
Larry, can we get you a drink?

246
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,569
It's 10:00 in the morning.

247
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,803
Well, fair enough, I guess.

248
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,144
Grab a seat.

249
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,850
Now, this situation with the
crššche, I want to know all about it.

250
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:25,906
Well, sir,

251
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:26,974
(CLEARS THROAT)

252
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,512
every single year since
the world was young,

253
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:35,191
the firehouse in the Nacogdoches
Township has displayed a crššche.

254
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,697
Now, the ACLU has filed
suit against the township

255
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:42,256
for displaying a religious
symbol on public property.

256
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,495
It's Christmas time. It's a crššche.

257
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,300
I could understand if we
were in gosh-darn Scarsdale,

258
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:51,002
but this is east Texas, and I
want to know who we're offending.

259
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,908
Except two lawyers from the ACLU.

260
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:56,414
That is a terribly interesting
and complicated question.

261
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,313
Let me make this suggestion, though.

262
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,217
There's a church about
a block and a half

263
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,222
from that firehouse, First
Baptist Church of Nacogdoches.

264
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,986
They've got a beautiful
rolling lawn out there in front.

265
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,856
No, no. This is a
Christian country, Charlie,

266
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,896
founded on Christian values. Sure.

267
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,022
We welcome other faiths
to worship as they wish,

268
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,465
but when you can't put a nativity scene

269
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:18,628
in front of a firehouse at Christmas
time in Nacogdoches Township,

270
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,137
something's gone terribly wrong.

271
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,299
Well, that's not really true, Larry.

272
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,968
You could move that
crššche over to that church

273
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,033
and everything's just fine.

274
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,306
That's not the point!

275
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,507
Okay. Why don't we just
start back at the beginning?

276
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,777
What can I do for you?

277
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,012
You can intervene in the case
against the crššche committee.

278
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,280
Intervene? How?

279
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,878
You appointed the judge.

280
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,253
I don't appoint judges.

281
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,189
I just made a recommendation
to the President.

282
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,283
Uh-huh.

283
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,657
I think you and I both
know what that means.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

285
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,662
I cannot just call up a
judge and tell him what to do.

286
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,632
Why? Well, 'cause
it's against a shitload

here for a second. Will you excuse me?

that crššche to, everybody lives.

like that? Okay. Mmm-mmm.

All in? All in.

306
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,531
It's 5 million.

307
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,305
Well, they can't shoot down
helicopters for $5 million, Jim.

308
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,780
Though they're trying to. Which
is more than I can say for us.

for me, would you?

00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:13,651
I was the best officer he
ever served at sea with,

324
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:17,849
and the worst officer he
ever served in port with.

00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,931
Washington. Now follow
it around to the right.

345
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:13,877
CHARLIE: The Jefferson
Memorial. The Arlington Bridge.

346
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,881
And there's the Pentagon.

347
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,348
Oh, that's the Pentagon.

348
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,543
That's the Pentagon.

349
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:23,520
How about I show you the second
best view in the District?

350
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,648
Why, Jane, would you like...

351
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:26,713

352
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:28,515
(SIGHS)

353
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,955
Well, that was predictable.

354
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,124
Just give me one second.

355
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,267
Hello? WOMAN.: That was
an extraordinary thing

356
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,825
you did today.

357
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,259
Who is this?

358
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,396
It's Joanne.

359
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,967
Joanne!

360
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,903
Why, gosh, how nice to hear from you.

361
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,808
Could I call you back in a little bit?

362
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,006
Is Ronald Reagan in
your bedroom right now?

363
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,140
No.Then I'm considerably more important

364
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,184
than whoever is. Is anything wrong?

365
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,982
This is gonna take just a second or two.

366
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,585
Okay, I'm all yours.

367
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:02,926
What did I do that was so extraordinary?

368
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,155
"Double it. "

369
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,026
'Cause I was told you
didn't have a girlfriend.

370
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,087
What?

371
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,157
You told Jim Van Wagenen to double it.

372
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:12,533
Well, shit, Joanne, I don't
know what you're talking about,

373
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,970
and if I did, it'd be classified,

374
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,707
and I'd wonder where
you got your information

375
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:17,799
on the Subcommittee.

376
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,173
Oh' what do you care' hon?

377
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,975
It's a little matter of national
security and I can't help but think...

378
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,107
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

379
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,776
Hold on.I am sorry,

380
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,877
but I was told you
didn't have a girlfriend.

381
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,387
I don't. This isn't my girlfriend.

382
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,947
It's the sixth
wealthiest woman in Texas.

383
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,788
Which is still pretty good.

384
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,088
Okay, so, hi.

385
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,755
A friend of mine has made a
terrific movie about the need

386
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,958
for American aid to Afghanistan.

387
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,591
He's made a movie? Yes.

388
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,502
I'm gonna run this movie Friday
night at my house at a fundraiser.

389
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,802
You know' you've never
been to my house' Charlie.

390
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,809
You want me to come to
Houston and see a movie?

391
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:55,040
There'll be women and wealthy
donors. See you Friday.

392
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,479
Yes, ma'am.

393
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,879
Hey.

394
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:04,945
Mmm-mmm.

395
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,082
Hey. Mmm-mmm.

396
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:13,689
Thank you, Joanne.

397
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,792
Okay. I know it was difficult for
you to come in here, hat in hand.

398
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,864
That's not the kind of upbringing,
I guess, is the word I'm looking for.

399
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,705
It's not the kind of man
you are. I understand that.

400
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,975
I'm not looking to humiliate
you or exact a price in any way,

401
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,948
so why don't you just apologize?

402
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,507
We'll call it water under the dam,
and we'll go about our business.

403
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,576
Excuse me, what the fuck?

404
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,513
What? What the fuck
are you talking about?

405
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,558
Clair George said you were
coming in here to apologize.

406
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,151
No, I'm supposed to come in here
so you could apologize to me.

407
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,991
According to whom? Clair George.

408
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,033
You told me to go fuck myself.
I'm supposed to apologize to you?

409
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,194
Also, water goes over a dam and
under a bridge, you poncy schoolboy.

410
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,569
Clearly there's been a miscommunication
between Clair George and somebody.

411
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,834
Excuse me. Yes?

412
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,170
Does this look all right? It's fine.

413
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,334
Thank you. I can sand it down a little.

414
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,605
I, I don't know. I have no
fucking idea who this guy is.

415
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,409
He is here to fix the glass that you
broke the last time you were here.

416
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,973
Could you just excuse us
for a second there? Yes.

417
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,075
You tell me to go fuck myself

418
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,710
and I'm supposed to
apologize? You break my window,

419
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,687
I'm supposed to apologize?
The Helsinki job was mine!

420
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,384
The Helsinki job was not yours. If
it was yours, you'd be in Helsinki.

421
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,892
Alan Wolfe stood in
this office! Alan Wolfe

422
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,484
is no longer the Director.
Yeah, it was on the books!

423
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,360
Alan Wolfe is no longer the
Director of European Operations.

424
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,796
He does not make those
appointments. I do.

425
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,561
Promises were made. Not by me.

426
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,932
I've been with the company for 24 years.

427
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,937
I was posted in Greece for 15.

428
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:30,771
Papandreou wins that election if I
don't help the junta take him prisoner.

429
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,743
I've advised and armed
the Hellenic army.

430
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,745
I've neutralized champions of Communism.

431
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:38,112
I've spent the past three
years learning Finnish!

432
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,151
Which should come in
handy here in Virginia!

433
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,187
And I'm never, ever, sick at sea.

434
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,655
So I want to know why I'm not gonna
be your Helsinki station chief.

435
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,521
You're coarse. Excuse me?

436
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,186
For Helsinki, I need someone
with diplomatic skills.

437
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,490
You don't have them.Is that right?

438
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,588
That is right. And I don't know
why the hell I didn't fire you

439
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:54,757
when you broke my fucking window!

440
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,698
Oh, yes, sure you do, Cravely.

441
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,827
Look, Gust... Yeah, you're
fucking Roger's fiancee

442
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,201
and you know I know.

443
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,003
I'm not... I'm not even gonna
dignify that with a response.

444
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,010
Yeah, yeah, you're
dignifying her in the ass

445
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,012
at the Jefferson Hotel, room 1 210.

446
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,981
But let me ask you. The
3,000 agents Turner fired

447
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,244
was that because they lacked
diplomatic skills as well?

448
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,183
You're referring to
Admiral Stansfield Turner?

449
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,312
Yeah, the 3,000 agents.

450
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:19,323
Each and every goddamn one of them
first or second generation Americans.

451
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:21,882
Is that because they lack
the proper diplomatic skills?

452
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,428
Or did Turner not think it
was a good idea to have spies

453
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,829
who could speak the same language as
the people they're fucking spying on?

454
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,425
Well, I'm sorry, but you
can hardly blame the Director

455
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,494
for questioning the loyalty to America
of people that are just barely Americans

456
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,563
in the first place. Yeah,
well, I'd like to take a moment

457
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,233
to review the several ways
in which you're a douchebag.

458
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,368
Get the fuck out of my office! Yes, sir.

459
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,741
Before I end your career, asshole.

460
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:41,836
Yes, sir!

461
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:45,042
Yeah, my friend, I'm gonna
need you for a second.

464
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,152
My loyalty?

465
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,651
For 24 years, people have
been trying to kill me.

466
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,090
People who know how.

467
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,152
Now, do you think that's because
my dad was a Greek soda pop maker

468
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,630
or do you think that's
because I'm an American spy?

469
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,224
Go fuck yourself,you fucking child.

470
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,773
How was I?

471
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:12,869
Thank you.

472
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:17,372
There's a woman in Aliquippa,
Pennsylvania, named Nitsa.

473
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,641
And she thinks she's a witch.

474
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,118
Yeah, she offered to put
a curse on Cravely for me.

475
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,279
Yeah?

476
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,683
And she...

477
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:29,091
She asked me do I want a
professional curse or a health curse.

478
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,256
"If it's a health curse,
I can do it right away,

479
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,026
"but a professional curse takes longer."

480
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,159
Well, I'm living proof
she's right about that.

481
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,531
Did you get the brownie?
Oh, no, sir, I didn't.

482
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:40,936
I got you.

00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:46,205

of phone conversations

arguing over office
space at NATO headquarters

486
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:55,214
and analyzing wiretaps out
of Mercury Bay, New Zealand.

487

You know, historically, a
hotbed of anti-American activity.

488
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,788
Yeah, nobody will come
near me. I'm in the weeds.

489
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,229
You know, a typical case officer

490
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:11,297
doesn't walk into his boss's office
and tell him to go fuck himself. Twice.

491
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,032
I just told you, I paid a
witch in Pennsylvania $80

492
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,802
to put a curse on Henry Cravely for me.

493

Do I sound like a
typical case officer? No.

494
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,375
Well, then,let's assume I'm not.

495
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,608
Listen. If you're really
not doing anything,

496
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,275
why don't you come
upstairs and work with us?

No, she is a Minute Woman, Charlie.

512
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,852
Oh. Joanne.

513
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:10,759
Yeah, she's a direct descendant
of George Washington's sister.

514
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,625
Says she had a great uncle
who was killed at the Alamo.

515
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,793
Former Miss Cotton Bowl. Had her
own local television talk show.

516
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:20,065
Look. Pakistan's Honorary
Consul to Houston, Texas.

517
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:21,537
How's that for a title, huh?

518
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:24,769
This is an ultra-right wing
group of anti-Communist fanatics.

519
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,310
They're not ultra-right wing.

520
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,141
What are they?

521
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,976
Well, they're ultra-right wing.

522
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,448
What are you doing
hanging around this woman?

523
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:36,180
Did you hear me say she was
a former Miss Cotton Bowl?

524
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,448
You are unbelievable.

525
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,682
Oh, come on. You're gonna love her.

526
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,691
And, you know, one of the things
she's trying to do over there

527
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,283
is liberate the women.

528
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,194
And what better way than
through a slave girl auction?

529
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:46,491
JOANNE: Charlie.

530
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,601
So sorry for keeping you waiting.

531
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,797
Oh, it's no problem,

532
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,362
This is Bonnie Bach.

533
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,237
So nice to meet you.

534
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:04,711
It's a pleasure meeting you, Mrs.
Herring. This is a wonderful party.

535
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,544
Why don't you give us a few moments?

536
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:10,951
Yes, sir.

537
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:16,323
Oh, Bobbie, if you could ask someone
for a Bombay martini up, very dry?

538
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,488
Oh, I'm not a slave girl, actually.

539
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,724
I'm the Congressman's
administrative assistant.

540
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,130
Isn't that wonderful for you.

541
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,428
Yes.

542
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:26,369
Two olives, please. Tell them
it's for me, they'll know.

543
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,769
Certainly.

544
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,367
She doesn't like me.

545
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:32,535
Everybody likes you.

546
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,044
She's a liberal.

547
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:35,875
Well, I'm a liberal.

548
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,111
Not where it counts.

549
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,947
Have you seen the house?

550
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:43,112
Well, I've seen the
downstairs, what's upstairs?

551
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,519
Fourteen bedrooms.

552
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,022
I should have a look.

553
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,115
What did you think of the movie?

554
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,887
What, that thing we just saw?

555
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,019
The reason for the party, yes.

556
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,860
Well, I'm not an expert
in the field or anything,

557
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,765
but the production quality
seemed amateurish to me.

558
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,325
Yeah, I'm not submitting the thing

559
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:00,633
for a Golden Globe nomination, Charlie.

560
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,969
You know what I'm talking about.

561
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,669
Well, as a member of
the Defense Subcommittee,

562
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,075
did you think I wasn't aware

563
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,340
that the Soviet Union's
invaded Afghanistan?

564
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,348
Yes, I believe my government is aware,

565
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,907
but I was wondering if they were
thinking of doing anything about it

566
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:17,182
other than boycotting the Olympics,
which I think you'll agree,

567
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,813
was a fairly impotent response

568
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,085
to the greatest national
security threat we've faced

569
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,558
since the Cuban Missile Crisis.

570
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,790
Well, I don't think making more
movies about it is gonna do the trick,

571
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,456
if that's what you're asking.

572
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:28,794
It's not.

573
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,799
Exactly how much power do you have
as a member of the Subcommittee?

574
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,361
Which one? I'm on two.

575
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,565
Foreign Ops.

576
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,768
Eight members and myself hand out
1 1 billion in foreign assistance.

577
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,176
And what about the Defense Subcommittee?

578
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,235
Our budget is hidden.

579
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,679
It is also unlimited.

580
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,215
Yeah.

581
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,848
Would you like to see my room?

582
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,079
Yeah.

583
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,179
(WHIMPERING)

584
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:55,215
So, unless I'm wrong, and
that would be unusual for me,

585
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,186
you sit at the intersection
of the State Department,

586
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,231
the Pentagon and the CIA.

587
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,691
You meet in a soundproof
room underneath the Capitol,

588
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:07,101
and you preside over a
secret and unlimited budget

589
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,801
for the three agencies you would
need to conduct a covert war.

590
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,503
Isn't that right?

591
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:14,807
I also have seats at the Kennedy Center.

592
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,247
Isn't that how you were able to
double the CIA budget for black approps

593
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:20,750
in Afghanistan just by saying so?

594
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:24,448
Why are you only asking mequestions
you already know the answers to?

595
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,390
Why is Congress saying one
thing and doing nothing?

596
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,359
Well, tradition mostly.

597
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,065
Come here.

598
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:38,761
Okay.

599
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:51,977
I do not understand the
energy women have after sex.

600
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,883
You're dancing around,
you're baking a pie.

601
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,853
JOANNE: Charlie? Yes, ma'am?

602
00:25:56,922 --> 00:26:00,050
Why is the CIA running a
fake war in Afghanistan?

603
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,116
They're doing everything they can.

604
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,058
They're doing it badly.

605
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:06,662
The CIA is arming the mujahideen.

606
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,925
Where do you think they're
getting their weapons?

607
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:11,332
They're arming them with
1 2.7 millimeter Dishukas

608
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,030
which would be good,

609
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:16,267
except the Soviets have specifically
armor-plated their Hind helicopter

610
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,242
to resist a 1 2.7 millimeter shell.

611
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,511
We sold Pakistan F-16s,

612
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,277
but didn't give them the
look-downlshoot-down radar.

613
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,408
If this were a real war,

614
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,884
State would issue a white paper
outlining the Communist threat

615
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:31,149
the way they did in El Salvador.

616
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:35,056
If this were a real war, there'd
be a National Bipartisan Commission

617
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:39,756
on Afghanistan, headed by Henry Kissinger
the way they did in Central America.

618
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:44,029
If this were a real war, Congress
would authorize $24 million

619
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,367
for covert operations the
way you did in Nicaragua.

620
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,764
If this were a real war...

621
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,874
You may be the sexiest woman ever.

622
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,310
I'm not kidding. You are Helen of Troy.

623
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,642
Are you patronizing me?

624
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,115
What do you want me to do, Joanne?

625
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,275
This is what I want you to do.

626
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:04,481
I want you to save
Afghanistan for the Afghans.

627
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,948
I want you to deliver
such a crushing defeat

628
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,754
to the Soviets that Communism crumbles,

629
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,193
and in so doing, end the Cold War.

630
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:12,354
I'll tell you, I'd do it, too,

631
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,921
but I got this Dairy Queen
problem in Nacogdoches.

632
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,993
Don't underestimate me, Charlie.
Believe everything you've heard.

633
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,500
What exactly do you want me to do?

634
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,006
Go to Pakistan and meet with Zia.

635
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,268
CHARLIE: Zia?

636
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,506
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.

637
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,606
He's the President of Pakistan.

638
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,204
I've already arranged it.

639
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:33,216
You've arranged a meeting between
me and the President of Pakistan?

640
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:34,273
Yes.

641
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:35,512
You're going to Israel next week

642
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,418
to meet with Zvi Rafiah
about the Lavi jets.

643
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,424
I want you to tack Pakistan
on the end of your trip.

644
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,686
And meet with the President?

645
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,923
Let him convince you that
it's a Christian imperative

646
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,193
to let the Afghans rid
their country of Communism.

647
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:52,801
Okay. It's not likely the President
of Pakistan is a Christian,

648
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:55,533
but I'm gonna do this for you, Joanne,

649
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:58,337
'cause you saved my ass
once with the pro-lifers

650
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,642
and I owe you my seat in Congress
and because you look very good naked.

651
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:06,741
But I have to tell you,
I'm elected by Jews.

652
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:09,286
How many Jews do you
have in your district?

653
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,378
Seven.

654
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,514
But congressmen aren't
elected by voters,

655
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,955
they're elected by contributors,

656
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,017
and mine are in, well, New
York, Florida, Hollywood,

657
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,586
because I'm one of
Israel's guys on the Hill.

658
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:20,892
And I don't know how they're gonna feel

659
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,433
about me taking up the cause of Muslims.

660
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:24,832
Well, that's your problem.

661
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,200
Yes, it is.

662
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,429
Go fight this warand win it, Charlie.

663
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:31,942
Everything possible is on the
line, including your manhood.

664
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,808
Oh, I was afraid you
were gonna say that.

665

(WATER RUSHING)

666
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,974
Well, I guess it ain't
gonna be twice tonight.

667
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,576
Well, I guess somebody can't count.

668
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:45,179
Oh, darling, I was talking about me.

Yeah.

very highly of you.

Oh, well, thank you, sir. Thank you.

when it comes to the
problem of the Soviets.

How do you do? Pleased to meet you.

682

683
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,206
Pleased to meet you.

So you understand the
situation on our border?

701
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,859
Yes, sir, I think I do.
And I think it's terrible.

702
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:09,696
And I know I speak for all the people in
the Texas Second Congressional District

703
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:12,292
when I say our thoughts and
our prayers are with you.

704
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,861
All the people of the Texas
Second Congressional District,

705
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,304
you say? Yes, indeed, sir.

706
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:20,401
Three million Afghan refugees are
living like poorly treated livestock.

707
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:22,241
Another two millionhave fled into Iran.

708
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:23,780
And two millionmore angry men

709
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,873
is just what the doctors
ordered for Iran,don't you think?

710
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,510
People are dying by
the tens of thousands.

711
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,646
And the ones that aren't are
crossing into Pakistan every day.

712
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,190
MAHMOOD: Would you
like to know how many?

713
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,089
One fifth of Afghanistan now lives

714
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,753
in Pakistan's North-West
Frontier Province.

715
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,797
ZIA: So, what I have been wondering is

716
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:43,027
why your State Department
would send someone here

717
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:45,331
who thinks he understands the problem.

718
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,895
'Cause I don't think the prayers of
the Texas Second Congressional District

719
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,304
are going to turn the trick.

720
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:53,401
Well, now, I wasn't sent here by
the State Department, Mr. President.

721
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,469
I was asked to come here
by our friend in Houston.

722
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,741
So this is a courtesy call.

723
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:01,683
I don't need courtesy. I need
airplanes, guns and money.

724
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:06,452
Well, we just doubled the
CIA budget for covert ops...

725
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:07,957
From 5 million to 10 million.

726
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,017
That's right. Is that a joke?

727
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,455
No. Is that meant to be a funny joke?

728
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:14,520
No, sir.

729
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,396
ZIA: Congressman, what they're saying is

730
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:20,130
$10 million from the U.S.
to fight the Russian Army

731
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,836
is such a low figure that it
can be mistaken for a joke.

732
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:27,639
I caught up to the sarcasm
there, sir. Let me be clear.

733
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:30,807
The United States is
eager to assist you.

734
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:31,940
No, you're not. You're not.

735
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,711
Absolutely not. I went to Oxford

736
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,082
and I know what that word means.

737
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,383
The U.S. is not eager to assist us.

738
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,322
Well, now it's my understanding
that we offered to  sell you F-16s.

739
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:41,380
You didn't want them.

740
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,120
Because you refused
to sell us the radar.

741
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:44,456
RASHID: So to hell with that.

742
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:47,862
ZIA: And this is emblematic
of American fence sitting

743
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:49,422
when it comes to fighting the Soviets.

744
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,435
To hell with it! You sell us
the planes but not the radar.

745
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:55,666
You offer Afghans rifles
from the First World War

746
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:59,373
while Soviet helicopters are
killing everything they can find,

747
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:02,072
people, animals, food
supplies. So to hell with it!

748
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,410
Yeah. You sell the Israelis the radar,

749
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,473
so that's why he says,
"To hell with it."

750
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,678
Again, I understood. Yeah.

751
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:12,322
Also, the arms and funding
should flow through us.

752
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,416
I'm sorry?

753
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,222
That's been part of the problem.

754
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,820
The arms and the funding
should flow through us.

755
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:22,525
We have experience with
warfare of this kind.

756
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,535
And your CIA has an
unimpressive track record.

757
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,764
Oh. I wouldn't say that.

758
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,741
They missed 130,000 Soviet
soldiers walking into Afghanistan.

759
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,404
Okay, we blew that call.

760
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,003
I would say so.

761
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:46,052
Well, I don't want to use up
any more of your hospitality,

762
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:50,993
so I will take your message
back to my committee chairman,

763
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,860
and we will give it
our fullest attention.

764

00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,666
I learned about you
before you came here.

you never promise anything

you cannot deliver.

No, I don't, Mr. President.

772
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:15,775
Then promise me this.

773
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,947
Go to Peshawar and
see the refugee camps.

00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,917

much hit rock bottom

00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:54,047
Congressman, I appreciate
your generosity,

859
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:58,987
but a sudden influx of money and
modern weaponry would draw attention.

860
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,415
What? A sudden influx
of money and modern...

861
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,518
Wait, it would draw attention?

862
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:05,619
Yeah.

863
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:09,158
Why, I don't even know what that means.

864
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,996
This is the Cold War.
Everybody knows about it.

865
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,126
Should I continue with the briefing?

866
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:16,299
Have you been to these refugee
camps? Have you heard these stories?

867
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:19,570
Congressman, I am required
to give you a briefing.

868
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:21,605
Should I continue?

869
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,402
No. Thank you.

870
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,822
(SIGHING)

871
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:42,122
You know, I had a neighbor, growing
up, with a name right out of Dickens.

872
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,428
Mr. Charles Hazard.

873
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:49,967
And Mr. Hazard didn't
like the neighborhood dogs

874
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,133
messing up his flower beds.

875
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,541
One day, I heard a bunch of
yelling from across the street,

876
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:56,045
so I ran on over to Mr. Hazard's,

877
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:59,879
and there were about 15 grown-ups
standing around my dog, Teddy,

878
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:03,852
who was writhing on the
ground in obvious agony.

879
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,253
Blood was pouring out of his mouth.

880
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,655
Mr. Hazard had ground up a glass bottle

881
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:11,991
and put it in a bowl of
dog food and fed it to him.

882
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,289
What did you do?

883
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:18,927
Well, I got some gasoline and
burned down his flower beds.

884
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:21,437
But that wasn't satisfying enough.

885
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:26,202
And then I remembered, Mr.
Hazard was an elected official.

886
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,609
He was the head of the town council.

887
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,580
His reelection every two years
was a foregone conclusion.

888
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:36,086
So come Election Day, I drove
over to the black section of town.

889
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:39,452
Now, these people hadn't voted
in any of these elections, so...

890
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:42,424
I was only 13, but I
had a farmer's license

891
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:45,451
and I filled up my car with black voters

892
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:46,791
and drove them to the polling place

893
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,195
and then waited, then
drove them on home.

894
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:51,200
But before they got
out of the car to vote

895
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:56,399
I said, "I don't mean to influence
you, but I think you should know

896
00:42:56,473 --> 00:43:00,068
"Mr. Charles Hazard has
intentionally killed my dog."

897
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:05,175
About 400 ballots were
cast in that election.

898
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,843
I drove 96 of them to the polls.

899
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:11,046
Hazard lost by 16 votes.

900
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:18,117
And that's the day I
fell in love with America.

901
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:23,462
What time do we land?

902
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,126
7:30 a.m. in D.C.

903
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:29,431
I want the CIA in my office at 10:00.

904
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,765
Assistant Deputy Director or higher.

905
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:35,839
Tell them that if I don't
see someone at 10:00,

906
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:40,850
I'm gonna start docking their allowance
at a rate of $1 million a minute.

907
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:42,313
Yes, sir.

908
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,086
And get me another
one of them, would you?

909
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:45,143
(CLEARING THROAT)

910
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,385
Yes, sir.

911
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:52,162
AGENT PATRICK: The AKs,
RPG-7 grenade launchers

912
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:55,289
and 82 millimeter mortars are
coming into Pakistan by air and sea,

913
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:57,193
and then trucks take
them to the Afghan border.

914
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,167
AGENT WELLS: Then we
take them across on mules,

915
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:00,863
which are running a little
more than we thought.

916
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:02,633
The mules? They're 2,400 a piece,

917
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,674
plus we got to get them
checked out. For what?

918
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:08,007
Diseases. Foot and mouth. Plus they
have to have their ears cleaned.

919
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:10,444
The mules are getting better
health care than the Afghans.

920
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:13,813
AGENT WELLS: Plus, they're gonna cost a
little extra if we want them pre-trained.

921
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,408
To do what? Walk over a mountain

922
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,612
with ammunition on their back.

923
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:18,018
Aren't they born with that instinct?

924
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:20,784
I mean, isn't that something
they want to do naturally?

925
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:24,089
You think Afghanistan might, one day,
think about building some fucking roads?

926
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,924
Gust. Yeah?

927
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,964
I got something for you.

928
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:30,331
I need you to be specific...

929
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,869
MARLA: The whole thing has changed.
Get your diary. I'll show you.

930
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:34,028
Okay.

931
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,206
RECEPTIONIST: No problem. Thank you.

932
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:39,902
He should be here any moment.

933
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:42,639
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

934
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:45,877
Good morning. Good morning, Congressman.

935
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:47,576
Welcome back. Yeah. Marla.

936
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:49,084
Welcome back. Suzanne.

937
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:50,620
Welcome back.

938
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:52,979
Who are you?

939
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:54,251
RECEPTIONIST: This is Gust Avrakotos.

940
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:56,087
He's come up from Langley
to bring you the information

941
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,151
that you wanted.Bonnie!

942
00:44:58,662 --> 00:44:59,651
Yes, sir?

943
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,322
I said Assistant Deputy
Director or higher.

944
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:03,298
I know, sir. I called... No,
Assistant Deputies don't come

945
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,459
to the Hill without a subpoena.

946
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,231
I'm the guy you want to talk to,
Congressman. I'm on the Afghan desk.

947
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:09,204
You're on the Afghan desk? Yeah.

948
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:11,867
Well, I wouldn't be too proud of
that. I just got back from there.

949
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:14,274
Oh, I know. And that's
a hell of a flight, too.

950
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:16,175
That nine hours flying
time against the jet stream.

951
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:18,373
Probably had to stop in Brussels,
plus the time difference.

952
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:19,780
I'd be a little grumpy myself.

953
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,442
I ain't grumpy because of the plane.

954
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:25,714
We want to give you this 'cause
we know you like single malt.

955
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:27,256
It's called Talisker,

956
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:29,315
and it's mentioned in a
Robert Louis Stevenson poem,

957
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,224
The Scotsman's Return from Abroad.

958
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:33,160
"The king o' drinks, as I conceive it,

959
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,721
"Talisker, Isla or Glenlivet!"

960
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:38,290
Who are you again? Gust Avrakotos.

961
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,103
Have Bonnie come into this meeting.

962
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:42,729
MARLA: Yes, sir.

963
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,167
What's the gift for?

964
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:48,109
It's from the Afghan desk for
doubling the budget for the mujahideen.

965
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:50,908
Oh. Well, thank you.

966
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,072
It was nothing.

967
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,841
Well, it's a nice bottle of Scotch.

968
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:57,677
Must've been hard to get.

969
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,518
No, doubling the budget was nothing.

970
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,616
I mean, $10 million for covert ops
against the Russian Army is meaningless.

971
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:05,184
What are you, an infant? Now,
you hang on just one second.

972
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,251
I don't remember your name.

973
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,661
Gust Avrakotos.

974
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:08,720
Gust Avrakotos.

975
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:09,788
Yeah.

976
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:11,562
Okay, you mind if I call you Gus?

977
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:14,069
Yeah, well, my name's Gust
with a "t," but I don't care.

978
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:19,576
Fifteen hours ago, I offered Harold
Holt the keys to the safe, okay?

979
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:24,642
I stood there in the office in Islamabad,
and I said, "How much do you need?"

980
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:26,239
And I was apparently annoying him.

981
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:29,080
Well, Harold Holt's a massive tool,
Congressman. He's a cake-eater.

982
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:30,848
He's a clown.He's a bad station chief.

983
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:33,981
And I don't mean to cast aspersions on
a guy, but he's gonna get us all killed.

984
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:35,217
Really? Yeah.

985
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,193
Well, how does he expect to defeat
the Soviets in Afghanistan without...

986
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:40,321
He said, "A sudden influx of
money..." Yeah, an influx of money

987
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:41,762
and new weaponry would draw attention.

988
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,300
He's not trying to defeat
the Soviets, Congressman.

989
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:45,460
What the hell are you talking about?

990
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:46,525
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

991
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:48,835
Excuse me.

992
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,668
I'm the Congressman's aide, Bonnie Bach.

993
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:52,936
Gust Avrakotos.

994
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,671
Gus, I need the room for a second.

995
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:56,440
Sure. Jailbait!

996
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:02,778
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey. Whoa, all right.

997
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:04,047
Just tell me what's happening.

998
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:06,351
A Justice Department task
force that was formed last year

999
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,618
to investigate reports of sex
between members of the House

1000
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:10,626
and their male internshas
recently widened

1001
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:12,491
to include the use of recreational drugs

1002
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:14,497
by senators and congressmen.

1003
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:15,827
Do you know a man named Paul Brown?

1004
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,093
BONNIE: He doesn't have
to answer that. Keep going.

1005
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,156
Oh, shit.

1006
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:21,966
Paul Brown, under investigation
by federal prosecutors for fraud.

1007
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:25,641
He wanted me to invest in
some TV show for Crystal.

1008
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:28,075
Well, he's saying he witnessed
youdoing cocaine nine times

1009
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:30,113
in a fantasy suite in Las Vegas.

1010
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,876
Brian Ross at NBC is breaking the story.

1011
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:36,975
All right, guys. I was in Las
Vegas with Crystal and Paul Brown,

1012
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:39,352
because she wanted me to
talk to him about this thing.

1013
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:41,084
There was cocaine?

1014
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,251
I want you to go in the other
room and start on a statement.

1015
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:45,852
Let's get Stu on the
phone. Okay, I'll call him.

1016
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:46,987
BONNIE: Okay, Bait, you
just need to start...

1017
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,053
CHARLIE: It's all right, everybody.

1018
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:49,655
It's gonna be all right.
I want to get back to...

1019
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:50,791
Gus!

1020
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:53,694
You having problems?

1021
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:54,862
(CLEARS THROAT)

1022
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:55,996
No.

1023
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:58,667
What do you mean,he's not
trying todefeat the Soviets?

1024
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:01,370
Well, he wants to bleed
them.Payback for Vietnam.

1025
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:02,969
Make it so they just haveto
keep sending troops in,

until they just go outof their
fucking minds the way we did.

1028
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:09,045
You mean to tell me that the
U.S. strategyin Afghanistan

1029
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,110
is to have the Afghans keep
walking into machine gun fire

1030
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:12,348
till the Russians run out of bullets?

1031
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:13,514
That's Harold Holt's strategy.

1032
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,490
It's not U.S. strategy.
What is U.S. strategy?

1033
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,992
Well, strictly speaking,
we don't have one.

1034
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,152
But we're working hard on that.

1035

"who are under investigation by a
Justice Department task force that is..."

1042
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:36,574
Don't say task force. It makes it sound

1043
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:37,909
like Eliot Ness is
running the thing. Okay.

1044
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,575

Who's the prosecutor?

Harold Holt. I can get the money.

down the helicopters.

Gus!

1087
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:26,511
Yeah. The Swiss make an antiaircraft gun

1088
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,387
called the Oerlikon. Listen, Charlie.

cannon, high rate of fire.

1090
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,752
I know the Oerlikon.

Don't forget the limo driver.

00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:34,855
What do you mean?

1093
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:37,729
Well, you took a limo from
the casino to the airport.

1094
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:40,497
Maybe it's easy enough to track down
a limo driver, hand him a subpoena,

1095

ask him if anything was
going on in the back seat,

of cleaning up this...

That's a thick door!

in my ear. Get past it.

fuck... Who the fuck are you?

right now. Take it easy.

their hands blown off

pick up something shiny.

1117

those bombs are toys.

out and fight the Red Army.

never seen anything like that.

No, me, neither.

00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,309
Well, should we try this Scotch,

1132
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:05,115
or is it gonna release
sarin gas when I open it?

1133
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:08,123
Oh, I don't think so,
but open it over there.

How'd a guy like you
get into the Agency?

00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,500
Since there's no other
reason I should be here,

1139
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:30,637
let's assume it's 'cause
I'm very good at this.

1140
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,618
They need to shoot down
the helicopters, Gus.

1141
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:38,245
They need at least, what, 50 Oerlikons.

1142
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,289
Yeah, it's gonna cost a
lot more than $10 million.

00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:42,257
And I say for the fourth
time, I can raise the money.

Yeah, how?

00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:46,856
Is the Oerlikon the gun
I should be recommending?

1146
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,430
I'm not sure.

00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,023
Who is sure? A weapons
guy named Mike Vickers.

I'll call him. Yeah.
Let's call him right now.

kid in the white shirt

think is a strategic weapons expert

1156
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,284
That was a trick question, Charlie.

It's the nerdy-looking
kid in the white shirt.

All right, no reason this
can't be fun, you know.

Appropriations Subcommittee.

How are you, sir? Fine, thank you.

1165
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,950
How old are you? I'll be 30 next week.

1166
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:44,418
This is the CIA's weapons expert?

1167
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:46,182
One of them. But he's the most senior.

Yeah, bishop to queen's knight 7.

00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,353
See? He's playing without
even looking at the board.

1171
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:52,554
That's a useful skill

1172
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:55,655
if Afghanistan's ever
invaded by Boris Spassky.

1173
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,030
Did my office not make it clear
to Langley that I'm in no mood

1174
00:53:58,101 --> 00:53:59,125
to be fucked around with? Charlie...

1175
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:01,363
You answer to me or you answer
to Jim Baker. Which do you want?

1176
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:04,305
All right, the guy's a fucking Green
Beret, Charlie. He trained with the SEALs.

1177
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,899
No one's trying to fuck
with you! MAN: Mike?

1178
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:09,912
Yeah, what was your move?
Knight to queen's bishop 5.

1179
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,572
All right, queen to king's rook 3.

1180
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:14,674
Guy on the right, you don't
want to trade queens with me.

1181
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:15,843
Shit.

1182
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:18,677
All right, I apologize.

1183
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,746
Okay. Everybody friends?

1184
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:24,190
As a former naval officer myself,
Mike, I should've known better.

1185
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,286
As a former naval officer, I'd
have been surprised if you had.

1186
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:27,387
Now, what the fuck? Hey.

1187
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:29,329
He said he was sorry. Hey.

1188
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:30,889
What can I do for you, sir?

1189
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:33,800
All right, he wants to make a
recommendation to his Subcommittee.

1190
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,862

antiaircraft cannon, that's what you'd use

00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,431
to shoot down the Ml-24 Hind
gunship in the mountains, right?

1192
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:40,635
Well, the Oerlikon's a good start,

1193
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,974
but the Russians will just start
flying higher altitude missions.

1194
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:44,070
So what else do they need?

1195
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:46,911
Same thing you give us.
AK-47 s, AK-7 4s, AKMS.

1196
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:49,042
The Soviets didn't come into
Afghanistan on a Eurail Pass.

1197
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,609
They came in T-55 tanks.

1198
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:53,417
The fighters need RPG-7
anti-tank grenade launchers,

1199
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:57,893
Katyusha 107 mm rockets, wire mines,
plastic mines, bicycle bombs, sniper rifles,

1200
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,394
ammunition for all the above

1201
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,225
and frequency-hopping
radios and burst transmitters

1202
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,926
so these guys aren't
so fucking easy to find.

1203
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,968
Well, I've written it all
in a report you can read.

1204
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:08,334
You'd be the first one who did.

1205
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:11,804
Send a copy of it to me by
secure courier right away.

1206
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:14,105
I will. All right. All right.

1207
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:17,912
There was a report?

1208
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,243
It's not that simple.

1209
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:22,714
Why not? Well, for
one thing it's covert.

1210
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:24,413
When an Afghan freedom
fighter gets captured,

1211
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:25,920
it can't be with an
American-made weapon on him.

1212
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,889
That's how a cold war
turns into an actual war,

1213
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:29,891
and that's something you
want to keep a good eye on.

1214
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,950
So anything we give
them has to look like

1215
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:34,929
it could have plausibly been
captured from the Soviets.

1216
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,693
Yeah, that's right. You
know who's good at that?

1217
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:39,098
Israel and Egypt. That's right.

1218
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:42,137
You know what Vickers
just described back there

1219
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:44,639
could cost as much as $40 million.

1220
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:47,536
I can get the appropriation. But how?

1221
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,570
I want to know how are you gonna
get the approval of Congress

1222
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:52,342
when they're saying no to
the Contras for nothing,

1223
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:55,077
for $5 million, a request
made by the President?

1224
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:57,210
When a black approp makes
it through this Subcommittee,

1225
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:59,517
the full body has to vote on it blind.

1226
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:01,750
They know the dollar amount, but
they don't know what it's for.

1227
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:05,852
So, theoretically, your $10
million can become 40 million

1228
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,954
without anyone ever noticing
but the Russian Army.

1229
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,896
Because Congress wouldn't
know what it was voting on.

1230
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:11,024
That's the beauty of it!

1231
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,864
All you need are the nine
other Subcommittee members.

1232
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,460
All I really need is
the Committee Chairman.

1233
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,300
Doc Long. Doc Long.

1234
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,733
And with Doc's backing, you'll get the
votes of the other Committee members.

1235
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:20,935
Yep. I don't believe you.

1236
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:22,034
I don't care.

1237
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:23,374
And until the phone rang
this morning, Charlie,

1238
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:25,710
I didn't know I'd never heard of you.

1239
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:27,409
Well, ask around.

1240
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,677
I did. And what'd you find out?

1241
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:31,744
That your greatest legislative
achievement in six terms

1242
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:33,288
was getting reelected five times.

1243
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:34,380
Anything else?

1244
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:36,789
That you hold more IOUs
than any member of the House.

1245
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:37,884
(LAUGHING)

1246
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:39,485
How about that?

1247
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:43,291
I represent the only district in
America that doesn't want anything.

1248
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:46,301
They want their guns, they
want low taxes, that's it.

1249
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:49,167
I can do favors. I
get to vote yes a lot.

1250
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:54,571
Now, me and three other
guys are killing Russians.

1251
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:55,906
I mean, is it possible

1252
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:59,779
that I've met the only elected
official in town who can help?

1253
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:03,983
Give me a week to set things up.

1254
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:07,784
Go pack a bag. I have a friend,
an arms dealer in Israel.

1255
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,226
He's who we need for this, God help us.

1256
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:12,488
Should be interesting. Yeah.

1257
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:14,420
All right.

1258
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:17,222
CHARLIE: We need you, Zvi.

1259
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,768
You're gonna be our man
inside the Israeli Parliament.

1260
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:21,599
ZVl: I'm not in the Israeli Parliament.

1261
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:23,662
That's what's gonna
make you so effective.

1262
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,038
No one has your pull
with the 10th Knesset.

1263
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,202
No one has your relationship
with the Speaker.

1264
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,508
And we are gonna... We're gonna
need your arm around Menachem,

1265
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:34,482
when he finds out that we're
working with Egypt and the Saudis.

1266
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:37,785
Tell him. Tell him why we need him.

1267
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,848
GUS: I'm not saying anything. Why not?

1268
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:43,819
I don't know who the fuck
these two other guys are.

1269
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:45,986
Well, ain't they bodyguards? Not ours.

1270
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:47,153
Zvi?

1271
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:53,996
Now, just to sum this up in a nutshell.

1272
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:57,165
You want me to move Israel

1273
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:02,404
toward a partnership with
Egypt, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

1274
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,106
And Saudi Arabia.

1275
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:08,808
Well, just a couple of problems I
can foresee off the top of my head.

1276
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:09,909
Look.

1277
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,010
Charlie... I know.

1278
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:15,251
...Pakistan and Afghanistan don't
recognize our right to exist.

1279
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:19,193
Calm down. We just got done
fighting a war with Egypt

1280
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:22,595
and every person who has ever
tried to kill me and my family,

1281
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,690
has been trained in Saudi Arabia.

1282
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:26,997
That's not entirely true, Zvi.

1283
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:29,498
I mean, some of them were trained by us.

1284
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:31,039
CHARLIE: Gus, come on.

1285
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:35,134
It's his sense of humor. It's
a bit of an acquired taste.

1286
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:37,236
Now, Zvi, look at me.

1287
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:40,647
This is the front of the Cold War.

1288
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:43,686
It's not in Berlin, it's not in
Cuba, it's not in Czechoslovakia.

1289
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:46,313
It's in a pile of rocks
called Afghanistan.

1290
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:48,983
These are the only people who are
actually shooting at the Russians.

1291
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:51,822
Now, you and I know we have
to get Soviet-made weapons

1292
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:53,260
into the hands of the mujahideen.

1293
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:55,058
And you and I know where
the largest stockpile

1294
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:58,032
of Soviet weapons outside
the Soviet Union is.

1295
00:58:58,101 --> 00:58:59,693
I can't tell you offhand how many

1296
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:01,999
and what kind of weapons
we've confiscated.

1297
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:06,405
I can. These are Keyhole-1
1 satellite photos.

1298
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:10,270
They've been degraded so
I can show them to you.

1299
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:12,141
All right, that's a
five-wheeled chassis tank.

1300
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,775
That's not the Mk.1, that's the T-55.

1301
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:17,820
And it and four others are
about 1 2 miles from here.

1302
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,151
What do you want tanks in mountains for?

1303
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,657
Oh, we don't. I just wanted
you to know I know you got them.

1304
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:26,126
$35.5 million. Which you'll
be able to appropriate.

1305
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:27,353
Yeah.

1306
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:29,398
Without the press
askingquestions about it.

1307
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:30,489
GUS: You know, there's good news there,

1308
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,400
because the press is going to be
busy asking about a weekend in Vegas

1309
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:35,835
and his pending arreston
charges of narcoticspossession.

1310
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:38,931
Oh, Gus.Shit, Charlie.

1311
00:59:39,008 --> 00:59:41,067
It's nothing. Is this true?

1312
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:43,237
No, for our purposes,
it doesn't really matter.

1313
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:44,974
Thank you. I was just explaining to him

1314
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:47,175
that as long as the press sees
sex and drugs behind the left hand,

1315
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,945
you can park a battle
carrier behind the right hand

1316
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:50,280
and no one's gonna fucking notice.

1317
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:51,479
What the hell happened?

1318
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:53,419
It's not germane. It's
not germane to these people

1319
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:56,925
who are fighting and dying, and
being massacred in their homes.

1320
00:59:56,993 --> 01:00:00,019
Now, for the love of Christ,
will you help us help them

1321
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,996
shoot down these fucking helicopters?

1322
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:06,764
I love you, Charlie,

1323
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,570
but you are a grown man

1324
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:14,707
who still hasn't learned to look both
ways before he crosses the fucking street!

1325
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,683
Yes, I'm in.

1326
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:28,050
But I don't like this
guy. I know how you feel.

1327
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:32,594
ZVl: What happens now?
You come with us to Cairo.

1328
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:34,960
This meeting's gonna be run
professional? Oh, absolutely.

1329
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:37,056
We'll be talking  to the
Deputy Defense Minister

1330
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,432
while his boss gets a belly
dance from a friend of Charlie's.

1331
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:42,562
What? A good friend
of mine back in Texas

1332
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:43,833
is a well-known belly dancer.

1333
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:47,501
It's always been her dream to
perform in Egypt, so she's our way in.

1334
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:51,479
While she's dancing for the Defense
Minster, we'll be talking to the Deputy.

1335
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:53,879
Oh, my God. No, she's
supposed to be good.

1336
01:00:57,353 --> 01:01:00,686
(ARABIC MUSIC PLAYING)

1337
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:32,750
That's an extraordinary woman. Oh, yeah.

1338
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:39,687
That's not any belly
dance I'm familiar with.

1339
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:43,061
That's why I wanted the
Defense Minister to see her.

1340
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:46,894
This is your girlfriend? Carol's
a friend. She's an old friend.

1341
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:50,530
I understand her father didn't allow
dancing because of the religion?

1342
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:53,268
Yeah, that's correct.

1343
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:54,809
And what religion is that?

1344
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,742
You know, she's a Baptist.

1345
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:03,177
As I was saying, the Russians will
learn, I'm quite afraid the hard way,

1346
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:05,743
to fear God's vengeance upon those

1347
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:09,519
who oppress his humble servants
who submit to him in Islam.

1348
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:12,624
Their skulls will
hang from the treetops.

1349
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:16,324
You can do whatever you like
with their skulls, I suppose.

1350
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:22,404
What has Gus here concerned is a SA
surface-to-air missiles you all have.

1351
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:24,201
For some reason, he thinks
they were stored poorly.

1352
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:26,764
No, no, no, the SA-7
s were stored properly.

1353
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:30,540
Excuse me. What about the
oppression of my people?

1354
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:32,274
Oh, Zvi. I beg your pardon?

1355
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:33,815
Fellows, we have to do this now.

1356
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:38,411
I am about to arrange for
$35 million worth of guns

1357
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:40,080
to be put into the hands of Muslims!

1358
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:43,489
I meant no disrespect. Oh, really?

1359
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:46,119
CHARLIE: Well, anyway, that...
None of this is important.

1360
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:49,164
You have Soviet-licensed factories
that can put out Kalashnikovs

1361
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:51,166
at a rate of 25,000 a week?

1362
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:54,328
That's correct. What
about city warfare devices?

1363
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:56,462
What kind? Bicycle bombs, limpet mines,

1364
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:57,801
plastic, tripwire mines?

1365
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:00,001
Yes, yes. Whatever you need.

1366
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:04,108
CHARLIE: We can't improve the price now,

1367
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:07,638
but when we come back for
more, we'll make it up to you.

1368
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:08,978
I agree.

1369
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:11,016
All right.

1370
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:25,058
Hey, you did good back there
ignoring the religious shit.

1371
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,902
'Cause these people are
totally fucking unspooled,

1372
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,871
and I'm not just talking
about the Muslims.

1373
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,831
Zvi's all right. Oh, I know he is.

1374
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,303
He is Mossad, by the way.

1375
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:38,541
What I'm talking about
is your friend in Houston.

1376
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:42,876
Now, she's got to stop throwing fundraisers
and she's got to stop doing press.

1377
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:45,512
Joanne is raising awareness.

1378
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:46,953
(CHUCKLES)

1379
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:52,721
She's using a non-secular vocabulary

1380
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:55,587
and framing this as a religious war.

1381
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:58,963
And America doesn't
fight religious wars.

1382
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:00,127
(SIGHING)

1383
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:02,671
Is that right? Yeah, that's
why I like living there.

1384
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:05,536
FLIGHT CAPTAIN.: Good morning' ladies
and gentlemen. This is your captain.

1385
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:07,438
We will begin our initial descent

1386
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,877
into Washington Dulles Airport.
I got to go down to Houston, so...

1387
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:12,972
...I would like to thank you and hope...

1388
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:15,950
Well, talk to her.
Yeah, I'll talk to her.

1389
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:21,923
You want me to go into
business with the Israelis?

1390
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,289
Just for this one purpose,
yes, Mr. President.

1391
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:28,888
The Israelis have the largest stockpile
of Soviet-made weapons in friendly hands.

1392
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:30,364
I know that.

1393
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:34,536
I need to trust that this
arrangement will remain secret.

1394
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:38,904
Pakistan and Israel would have to
appear to be enemies in the public eye.

1395
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:41,443
Yeah, I don't think that's a tough sell.

1396
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,239
You have authority to do this?

1397
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:46,406
None whatsoever. In fact, I'm pretty
close to violating the Logan Act.

1398
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:48,347
Well, I don't know what that is.

1399
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:49,816
But, Charlie. Yes, sir.

1400
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,787
If I see one fucking Star
of David on a crate...

1401
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:54,652
You won't. I promise.

1402
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:57,650
Hey. Excuse me.

1403
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:00,491
You want me to take a
look at those remarks?

1404
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,588
Why? Just... Well, your introduction,

1405
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:06,999
want me to look it over? It's an
introduction, Charlie. I'll be fine.

1406
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:18,473
Today we honor President
Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan.

1407
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:21,575
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

1408
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:35,859
Before we go any further' I
would like you all to know this'

1409
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:38,599
President Zia did not kill Bhutto.

1410
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:41,497
In the time that he's been President'

1411
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:44,505
the fortunes of Pakistan
have changed radically.

1412
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:45,801
I've asked you all here today...

1413
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:49,234
(CROWD CHATTERING)

(CUTLERY CLINKING)

1415
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:56,276
You disappeared.

1416
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:58,476
Well, they weren't
selling alcohol in there.

1417
01:05:58,554 --> 01:06:01,022
It's a traditional Pakistani gathering.

1418
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:02,887
You think they might be
a lot happier over there

1419
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:06,326
if they could just get women and booze
in the same room at the same time?

1420
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:08,192
I think they'd be a whole
lot happier over there

1421
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:09,731
if the Communists got out.

1422
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,359
"Zia did not kill Bhutto."

1423
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:16,293
That's not something you usually
hear in introductory remarks.

1424
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:19,830
He didn't, Charlie. Bhutto had
a trial and was found guilty.

1425
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:21,536
Shocking verdict.

1426
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:24,972
What did you need to talk to me about?

1427
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:29,545
Joanne, darling, dial down the religion.

1428
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:32,217
What? It could alienate people

1429
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:34,017
whose support we need.

1430
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:36,786
It's luncheons like this that
are raising the money we need.

1431
01:06:36,859 --> 01:06:39,726
This thing is not gonna get
done by ballrooms full of people

1432
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:41,023
in the Houstonian Hotel.

1433
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:44,464
It's gonna get done by the
CIA, Israel, Egypt and Pakistan,

1434
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:46,160
and it's gonna get done quietly.

1435
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:47,600
Now, you start making people think

1436
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,138
we're trying to convert
everybody to Christianity.

1437
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:53,403
I was saved by Jesus Christ,
Charlie, and I am not ashamed of it.

1438
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:56,707
My fervor is not about religion,
it's about freedom of religion,

1439
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:57,837
which we have, they want,

1440
01:06:57,913 --> 01:07:00,177
and the Communists are
slaughtering them for.

1441
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:03,548
And I get it. Just tamp down the fervor.

1442
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:07,454
Well, I can't modulate
God's will, sweetie.

1443
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,089
You can try.

1444
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:13,587
Now, I got to get back to D.C. They've
set up a briefing for me at Langley.

1445
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:16,028
On what? On getting the guns.

1446
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,458
Afghanistan's barely a country.

1447
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:22,800
There's no phones or
roads outside the cities.

1448
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,305
It's likely that a
villager would live his life

1449
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,933
without having contact with another
village just three miles down the road

1450
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:29,068
unless he was going to war against them.

1451
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:31,773
Now, my thinking is instead
of 400,000 sloppy guys,

1452
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:35,544
we concentrate on several elite
forces totaling about 150,000.

1453
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:37,108
Give these guys real training,

1454
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:40,121
20 different courses covering
irregular warfare disciplines.

1455
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:41,713
GUS: And do you have anybody in mind?

1456
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:44,885
The most successful rebels
today are in the Panjshir Valley.

1457
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,451
They're called the United Front
of the Council of the North.

1458
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:49,588
We've earmarked them
for 10 million in weapons

1459
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:52,259
and 10 to 15 agency
advisors for training.

1460
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:55,394
CHARLIE: Who's their
leader? Ahmed Shah Massoud.

1461
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:58,929
He's Tajik, so he's not
well liked by the Pashtun.

1462
01:07:59,008 --> 01:08:02,171
CHARLIE: So the... What, the Tajiks
have a problem with the Pashtuns?

1463
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,405
Well, they say when a Tajik
wants to make love to a woman,

1464
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,278
his first choice is
always a Pashtun man.

1465
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:11,208
It's funnier in the original Pashto.

1466
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:15,218
All right, I've heard enough.
I'm going to go get our money.

1467
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:17,790
All right, don't fuck us up now.

1468
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:19,787
Awesome pep talk.

1469
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:24,128
Afghanistan, Egypt,
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,

1470
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,998
these are all
totalitarian dictatorships.

1471
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:31,506
And they'd like to blow the only democracy
in the region right into the Mediterranean.

1472
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:34,634
Now, you heard me say that
Israel's gonna be on board.

1473
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:37,406
Oh, well, Zvi Rafiah's out of his mind.

1474
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:41,742
These people are draconian thugs,
and in an evil and twisted derby

1475
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:44,183
between the Communists
and the Fundamentalists,

1476
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:45,811
it's 6-to-5 and pick them,
as far as I'm concerned.

1477
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:48,288
No, you're wrong about that, Doc,
and you know you don't mean it.

1478
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:52,157
In Pakistan, a blind girl gets
raped, but there's a witness.

1479
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:54,719
Now, in Pakistan it
takes four witnesses.

1480
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:57,231
So the rapist walks away
and the girl is in prison.

1481
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:58,823
Can you tell me why?

1482
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:01,631
Well, fornication. That's right.

1483
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:04,730
Mr. Chairman, President Zia is the
only one willing to shoulder the risk

1484
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,970
of actively training and
funding the mujahideen

1485
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:09,408
while Egypt and Saudi Arabia...

1486
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:12,208
Now, the Saudis are matching
any funding from Congress?

1487
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:14,806
That's right. So when
you say 40 million to me,

1488
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:16,112
you're really talking about 80 million.

1489
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:17,311
Only 40 from us.

1490
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:19,479
You want to put $80 million
in the hands of these people?

1491
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:21,682
No, see, Doc, now, if you took
a trip with me to the border,

1492
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:23,452
you'd stop calling them "these people."

1493
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:27,018
They are farmers and children mostly,
and they are fighting our enemies for us.

1494
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:28,586
I know. And that should
be impossible for America.

1495
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,564
I know. It should be
impossible for America

1496
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:34,194
to sit on the bench while little kids
and their mothers fight our enemies.

1497
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:37,103
Now, all you have to do to
change that is to support me

1498
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,640
in the Committee, Mr. Chairman.

1499
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:43,041
I'm sorry, Charlie, but doubling
from 5 to 10 million is one thing,

1500
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:45,876
but, you know, I just
can't get behind this.

1501
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:47,415
(PHONE RINGING)

1502
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:51,881
TRISH: Joanne Herring's
residence. Who's speaking?

1503
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:54,752
Miss Herring, Congressman
Wilson for you.

1504
01:09:57,293 --> 01:09:58,692
Hello. CHARLIE.: Hey.

1505
01:09:58,827 --> 01:09:59,919
Tell me what's happening.

1506
01:09:59,995 --> 01:10:03,123
Well, I need Doc Long, and
he's not getting on board.

1507
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:06,225
Now, he's a church-going
guy, so I thought,

1508
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:08,361
you know' maybe you
could... So now you need God.

1509
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:11,202
Yeah. Let me give you his private line.

1510
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,039
I've got it.

1511
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:14,700
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1512
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:16,071
Trish! Yes, ma'am.

1513
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:18,136
Boss? Yeah.

1514
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:21,342
Hey, that's a nice

01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:08,323
Did you hear me say it was a million,
not a billion, for school construction?

1850
01:31:08,396 --> 01:31:10,330
Yeah, we heard you.
Everybody heard you, buddy.

1851
01:31:10,398 --> 01:31:12,059
They heard you in Dover, Delaware.

1852
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:13,600
Well, I sure hope I'm
not annoying you, Bob,

1853
01:31:13,668 --> 01:31:15,533
'cause that's the last
thing I want to do. Look...

1854
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:18,572
I was in the Roosevelt Room
with the President last week.

1855
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:19,731
You know what he said?

1856
01:31:19,807 --> 01:31:22,002
He said, "Afghanistan?
Is that still going on?"

1857
01:31:22,076 --> 01:31:23,475
Well, it is.

1858
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:25,111
Half the population of that country

1859
01:31:25,179 --> 01:31:26,510
is under the age of 1 4. Charlie.

1860
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:30,176
Half the population is
under the age of 1 4.

1861
01:31:31,052 --> 01:31:32,542
Now, think how fucking
dangerous that is.

1862
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:35,350
They're gonna come home and
find their families are dead,

1863
01:31:35,423 --> 01:31:36,947
their villages have been napalmed.

1864
01:31:37,024 --> 01:31:39,788
And we helped kill the guys who did
it. Yeah, but they don't know that, Bob,

1865
01:31:39,861 --> 01:31:41,829
'cause they don't get home
delivery of The New York Times.

1866
01:31:41,896 --> 01:31:45,093
And even if they did,
it was covert, remember?

1867
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:49,633
This is what we always do. We
always go in with our ideals

1868
01:31:49,704 --> 01:31:52,537
and we change the
world and then we leave.

1869
01:31:52,907 --> 01:31:54,499
We always leave.

1870
01:31:54,909 --> 01:31:57,707
But that ball, though,
it keeps on bouncing.

1871
01:31:57,778 --> 01:32:00,178
What? The ball keeps on bouncing.

1872
01:32:00,381 --> 01:32:01,712
MAN 2: Yeah, we're a
little busy right now

1873
01:32:01,782 --> 01:32:03,716
reorganizing Eastern
Europe, don't you think?

1874
01:32:03,784 --> 01:32:05,547
We've spent billions.

1875
01:32:05,686 --> 01:32:09,417
Let's spend a million on
H.R.1 18 and rebuild a school.

1876
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:13,017
Charlie, nobody gives a shit
about a school in Pakistan.

1877
01:32:13,628 --> 01:32:15,027
Afghanistan.

1878
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:41,514
MAN.: So' for the first time' a civilian
is being given our highest recognition'

1879
01:32:42,089 --> 01:32:44,114
that of Honored Colleague.

1880
01:32:44,325 --> 01:32:46,953
Ladies and gentlemen of
the Clandestine Services'

1881
01:32:47,028 --> 01:32:49,121
Congressman Charles Wilson.

1882
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:54,591
MAN: Bravo, Charlie.
