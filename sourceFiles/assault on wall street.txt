1
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:35,529
<i>The truth is, on Wall Street</i>

2
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:39,834
<i>a lot of people just weren't
very good at their jobs.</i>

3
00:00:39,836 --> 00:00:42,803
<i>It started out 16 months
ago as a mortgage crisis</i>

4
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:46,140
<i>and it slowly evolved
into a credit crisis.</i>

5
00:00:46,142 --> 00:00:47,808
<i>We ask about the taxpayers
being on the hook,</i>

6
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:48,876
<i>guess what?</i>

7
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:55,082
an unusual step for a lame duck
president, but the country...

8
00:00:55,084 --> 00:00:57,852
<i>Trying to be free
market advocate</i>

9
00:00:57,854 --> 00:01:01,088
<i>when it's really an
"anything goes" mentality.</i>

10
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,823
<i>On Friday, Congress
finally passed</i>

11
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:05,426
<i>and President Bush
signed into law...</i>

12
00:01:05,428 --> 00:01:06,827
<i>Begin to restore
strength and stability</i>

13
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:12,500
<i>will buy out Wall Street's
bad investments.</i>

14
00:01:12,502 --> 00:01:15,002
<i>A full-blown
financial storm.</i>

15
00:01:15,004 --> 00:01:18,906
<i>In just 6 months, 3 of the 5
biggest independent firms</i>

16
00:01:18,908 --> 00:01:20,975
<i>on Wall Street have
now disappeared.</i>

17
00:01:20,977 --> 00:01:23,110
<i>numbers are staggering
they don't begin to explain</i>

18
00:01:23,112 --> 00:01:24,845
the greed and incompetence

19
00:01:24,847 --> 00:01:26,847
that created this mess.

20
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:30,484
<i>No regulation, no
supervision, no discipline.</i>

21
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:33,020
Terrible debt that was
gnified by reckless borrowing

22
00:01:33,022 --> 00:01:34,989
and complex securities.

23
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:37,057
<i>The idea that you could
lend money to someone</i>

24
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:40,861
who could not pay it back is not
an inherently attractive idea.

25
00:01:40,863 --> 00:01:42,863
<i>I don't know why this
company's coming to Congress.</i>

26
00:01:42,865 --> 00:01:44,965
<i>However it seemed to fly
with people who were making</i>

27
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:46,467
<i>$10 million a year.</i>

28
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:47,601
<i>They think they can take
that money</i>

29
00:01:47,603 --> 00:01:48,869
<i>and do whatever
they wanna do.</i>

30
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:50,671
<i>They decide to punish
the country.</i>

31
00:01:50,673 --> 00:01:54,975
<i>Neel Kashkari, the man
in charge of the bailout.</i>

32
00:01:54,977 --> 00:01:57,044
We're supposed to be with the
smartest investors in the
world

33
00:01:57,046 --> 00:01:59,013
and they did it themselves.

34
00:01:59,015 --> 00:02:01,982
<i>I would call it criminal
neglect and incompetence.</i>

35
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:06,153
<i>They're certainly
not worth it.</i>

36
00:02:06,155 --> 00:02:09,657
<i>Instead of helping consumers
with mortgages and loans.</i>

37
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:10,891
<i>People at the top of these
firms chose to look away,</i>

38
00:02:10,893 --> 00:02:13,160
<i>to take more risk
to enrich themselves</i>

39
00:02:13,162 --> 00:02:16,230
<i>and it is truly a crime.</i>

40
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:25,005
What's our risk?

41
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:26,640
12 billion.

42
00:02:26,642 --> 00:02:29,176
But we have a real
situation here,

43
00:02:29,178 --> 00:02:31,111
our clients are
about to jump ship.

44
00:02:31,113 --> 00:02:34,515
The problem is saving this
company, not the clients.

45
00:02:34,517 --> 00:02:36,016
This company!

46
00:02:36,018 --> 00:02:37,518
We shifted 4 billion
into deposits,

47
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,019
which leaves us with 8.

48
00:02:39,021 --> 00:02:43,023
But that move only buys us
a few more weeks, at best.

49
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:44,925
I talked to Meryl, they said
they'd ensure the paper

50
00:02:44,927 --> 00:02:47,027
for two weeks but they want
200 million to do it.

51
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:49,730
Two weeks is nothing, we need
two months at least.

52
00:02:49,732 --> 00:02:53,000
No, it's time for triage.

53
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:54,668
It's time to dump the
certificates on the market,

54
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,236
all of them.

55
00:02:55,238 --> 00:02:57,671
What about the pension
fund investors?

56
00:02:57,673 --> 00:02:59,540
We're talking over
15 billion.

57
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:01,675
But if other houses
follow suit,

58
00:03:01,677 --> 00:03:07,081
Our priority is saving this
house and fuck all the others!

59
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,216
Our responsibility begins
and ends with our partners

60
00:03:09,218 --> 00:03:11,151
and our shareholders
and that's it.

61
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:13,120
Investors gamble, they lose,

62
00:03:13,122 --> 00:03:14,955
that's the risk that
they agreed to take.

63
00:03:14,957 --> 00:03:20,094
why should they complain when
they lose money on the market?

64
00:03:20,096 --> 00:03:21,962
Shit happens, now dump it!

65
00:03:21,964 --> 00:03:23,964
Dump it all
right fucking now!

66
00:03:23,966 --> 00:03:26,700
Even after we dump the stocks
we're still far too exposed

67
00:03:26,702 --> 00:03:28,102
and we've got
no parachute here.

68
00:03:28,104 --> 00:03:30,170
I'm gonna take care of that.

69
00:03:42,117 --> 00:03:43,050
Charlotte?

70
00:03:43,052 --> 00:03:46,620
with the secretary of treasury?

71
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:47,054
Will do.

72
00:03:47,056 --> 00:03:47,988
Today.

73
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,123
Understood sir, today.

74
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,091
Thanks.

75
00:04:00,002 --> 00:04:01,035
You heard Stancroft,

76
00:04:01,037 --> 00:04:03,070
the entire company's
in jeopardy.

77
00:04:03,072 --> 00:04:04,738
Yeah, with 51 million
in his pocket...

78
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,007
and you know as well as
I do, this is bullshit.

79
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:08,809
This is Stancroft and his
fucking pissing contest

80
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:10,010
with his goddamn pluggers.

81
00:04:10,012 --> 00:04:13,347
but we don't really
have a choice, do we?

82
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:17,084
All right people, listen up!

83
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:19,119
All right, I've got some
great news for you guys.

84
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:21,021
In the next three days
we are gonna increase

85
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:23,290
your incentives by 3 percent.

86
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:25,759
But I need you to get on
the horn and get all
your top clients

87
00:04:25,761 --> 00:04:28,162
and really push the real
estate growth superfund.

88
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:30,064
As well, you will be receiving
a memo

89
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:32,299
in the next couple minutes
detailing all the products

90
00:04:32,301 --> 00:04:34,034
that we need you guys
to unload.

91
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:37,104
Whoever sells the most
gets the largest bonus.

92
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:39,039
All right, let's go people!

93
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,307
Move it!

94
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:41,108
Get those numbers!

95
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,076
Sell, sell!

96
00:05:14,075 --> 00:05:16,143
Hey girl.

97
00:05:16,145 --> 00:05:19,213
Hey boy.

98
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:42,770
The good news,
as we can see here,

99
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:45,105
is that the tumors
are completely gone.

100
00:05:45,107 --> 00:05:47,374
That's the good news.

101
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:50,878
Not bad news, just simply
less than good news.

102
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,248
which is why we're seeing a
recurrence of your symptoms.

103
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,749
But you got everything,
right?

104
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:56,750
Yes, we see this
on occasion.

105
00:05:56,752 --> 00:05:57,918
Even though the tumors
are gone,

106
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,122
as it were as though
the tumor were still there.

107
00:06:02,124 --> 00:06:05,893
Hormone injections once a
week, that's the first thing.

108
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:07,294
It's a tricky balancing act,

109
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:08,262
we'll have to monitor
your levels

110
00:06:08,264 --> 00:06:10,330
until we find the right mix.

111
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:13,867
Also, your blood sugar level
has sky rocketed.

112
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:15,936
Again, as a result of the
gland's reaction to the tumor,

113
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:17,738
so we'll have to treat
you for diabetes.

114
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,273
But she's going to be
all right?

115
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:21,742
Oh yes, we just have a bit
more ways to get you there,

116
00:06:21,744 --> 00:06:23,744
that's all.

117
00:06:23,746 --> 00:06:27,281
What about, um... we were...

118
00:06:27,283 --> 00:06:28,282
We were planning on
getting pregnant

119
00:06:28,284 --> 00:06:31,218
before the diagnosis.

120
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,153
At this particular time, it
would be an extremely

121
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:35,889
high-risk pregnancy, both
for you and the baby.

122
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:40,160
but once we get you
to acceptable levels
with treatment,

123
00:06:40,162 --> 00:06:46,200
which lowers the risk,
then by all means yes.

124
00:06:46,202 --> 00:06:48,235
There's a new gene therapy
that certain patients

125
00:06:48,237 --> 00:06:49,436
have responded well to,

126
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:51,238
which could get us
to normalcy faster.

127
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,806
It's a little on the
experimental side,

128
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:54,241
Sign us up, doc.

129
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:54,908
Yeah.

130
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,243
Excellent!

131
00:06:56,245 --> 00:07:00,347
I know it's difficult but try
hard to relax and not to worry,

132
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:02,316
it only adds stress to
your system. Okay?

133
00:07:02,318 --> 00:07:03,917
Thank you.

134
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:04,785
Thanks doc.

135
00:07:04,787 --> 00:07:06,854
You're welcome.

136
00:07:07,922 --> 00:07:10,357
It seems as if your coverage
cap limit has been reached.

137
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:12,192
Coverage cap limit,
what's that?

138
00:07:12,194 --> 00:07:13,827
It's standard among
many insurers,

139
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:15,195
you really should call them.

140
00:07:15,197 --> 00:07:18,866
But regarding today,
we'll need payment

141
00:07:18,868 --> 00:07:24,204
Oh, okay... well we can
call in later to
reschedule, we'll talk.

142
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:25,873
No, no, no... fine, we'll
uh... we'll use the card.

143
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,241
I'm sure it's some
kind of mistake.

144
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:29,276
If I can get my wallet
out of my pocket...

145
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:31,278
there you go.

146
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,346
There.

147
00:07:32,348 --> 00:07:35,249
Are you sure you wanna use
the card?

148
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:37,017
Am I sure?

149
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:37,818
Not really.

150
00:07:39,855 --> 00:07:42,222
Just call them.

151
00:07:42,224 --> 00:07:44,825
So, should we keep
next Tuesday then?

152
00:07:44,827 --> 00:07:48,028
Yeah, why don't you just
call in and we can...

153
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,229
Okay. Thank you!

154
00:07:49,231 --> 00:07:49,830
Thanks.

155
00:07:49,832 --> 00:07:50,230
Thank you!

156
00:07:50,232 --> 00:07:51,965
Bye.

157
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:54,268
Thanks.

158
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,336
Coverage cap?

159
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:06,246
This is the first time it's
ever been mentioned to me.

160
00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:08,315
Now listen, I'm on the
phone to you guys

161
00:08:08,317 --> 00:08:10,017
at least a hundred
times this year...

162
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:11,518
someone should've
said something.

163
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,320
Sir, it's clearly
stated in the...

164
00:08:13,322 --> 00:08:15,322
I've been buried in a metric
ton of paperwork from you guys

165
00:08:15,324 --> 00:08:19,526
Now, I can't be expected to
catch every line of fine print

166
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:20,561
from every letter.

167
00:08:20,563 --> 00:08:22,262
I work 6, 7 days a week.

168
00:08:22,264 --> 00:08:23,263
It's company policy, sir...

169
00:08:23,265 --> 00:08:24,531
I get that it's
company policy

170
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:26,300
but that's got nothing to do...

171
00:08:26,302 --> 00:08:28,335
I'm sorry, there's
nothing more we can do
for you at this point.

172
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:29,369
So what you're saying
is go fuck yourself,

173
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:30,370
have a nice day.

174
00:08:30,372 --> 00:08:33,473
I sincerely doubt you're
at all apologetic.

175
00:08:33,475 --> 00:08:35,475
You're not supposed to be,
right?

176
00:08:35,477 --> 00:08:38,445
Mr. Baxford, I'm very sorry.

177
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:00,367
Sorry.

178
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:02,302
Oh, baby...

179
00:09:02,304 --> 00:09:05,038
Jim, it's just... it's useless.

180
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,573
Don't say that.

181
00:09:06,575 --> 00:09:09,576
It is, I mean, I'm just...

182
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:11,345
I'm stuck here and I can't work

183
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:15,315
and I'm sick all the time, and
you've been working so hard...

184
00:09:15,317 --> 00:09:18,051
I'm working for us.

185
00:09:18,053 --> 00:09:21,321
Jim, I read the invoice
and hormone treatments,

186
00:09:21,323 --> 00:09:25,325
they cost $300 a shot.

187
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:26,960
That's on top of all
the other medication

188
00:09:26,962 --> 00:09:30,097
and then the gene therapy,
they could be anywhere from

189
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:32,432
50,000 to 70,000,

190
00:09:32,434 --> 00:09:33,500
and if the insurance
doesn't cover it...

191
00:09:33,502 --> 00:09:37,604
I'm not, I can't let you spend
our whole life savings.

192
00:09:37,606 --> 00:09:40,107
Stop, stop! Stop.

193
00:09:40,109 --> 00:09:41,942
Listen to me, we need
the treatments,

194
00:09:41,944 --> 00:09:43,377
you need to get well.

195
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:45,345
Once we get well we
can have our baby

196
00:09:45,347 --> 00:09:49,416
and live the life we
wanna live, okay?

197
00:09:58,359 --> 00:09:59,960
Okay, good night.

198
00:09:59,962 --> 00:10:04,031
Good night.

199
00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:23,417
Hey girl.

200
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:26,486
Hey boy.

201
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,063
What's it look like
I'm doing?

202
00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:39,399
Hey... we're not supposed
to get pregnant yet.

203
00:10:39,401 --> 00:10:42,469
We can practice.

204
00:10:42,471 --> 00:10:43,603
Yeah...

205
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:47,474
Yeah?

206
00:10:50,178 --> 00:10:54,247
Jim, I love you so much.

207
00:11:16,437 --> 00:11:18,438
Dude, that sucks!

208
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,073
There's an actual coverage cap
on the insurance,

209
00:11:20,075 --> 00:11:22,442
that means that there's
really literally like,

210
00:11:22,444 --> 00:11:24,244
a limit to how much you
can spend on Rosie

211
00:11:24,246 --> 00:11:25,712
per month for her medical?

212
00:11:25,714 --> 00:11:30,217
it says if you get too sick
and it's too expensive,

213
00:11:30,219 --> 00:11:31,485
they stop fucking paying.

214
00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:34,588
I was planning on having
by the time I was 60.

215
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,456
I guess if I get sick I'd
be better off swallowing

216
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,592
my own gun.

217
00:11:38,594 --> 00:11:40,761
Rosie's worried out
of her fucking mind.

218
00:11:40,763 --> 00:11:42,562
So what are you gonna do?

219
00:11:42,564 --> 00:11:44,464
I got some money tucked away,
army disability,

220
00:11:44,466 --> 00:11:46,066
stuff like that.

221
00:11:46,068 --> 00:11:47,467
I'll call my broker.

222
00:11:47,469 --> 00:11:49,202
I hear the market's
shit right now man,

223
00:11:49,204 --> 00:11:50,737
what are you invested in?

224
00:11:50,739 --> 00:11:52,806
Structured notes,
whatever's safest.

225
00:11:52,808 --> 00:11:54,808
Fuck, I hope so bro.

226
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:59,546
I'll call in the lunch.

227
00:12:11,092 --> 00:12:14,161
Fuck.

228
00:12:17,098 --> 00:12:18,498
I'm not making enough.

229
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,567
What up you lazy bastards?

230
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:22,235
What'd you do,
just roll out of bed?

231
00:12:22,237 --> 00:12:23,103
It's Jim Baxford.

232
00:12:23,105 --> 00:12:24,504
No, no... second shift.

233
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:26,106
Lunch for you,
breakfast for us.

234
00:12:26,108 --> 00:12:28,508
Just sit down and shut up,
we already ordered for you.

235
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:33,580
Tom gets the cheeseburger,
Jim... chili.

236
00:12:33,582 --> 00:12:36,116
Cold chili, and he's always
surprised, you know?

237
00:12:36,118 --> 00:12:37,284
But he always finishes.

238
00:12:39,254 --> 00:12:40,587
Give me a couple of
days, call the office.

239
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:44,524
Oh uh, what's going on with
my funds?

240
00:12:44,526 --> 00:12:46,259
<i>Uh... Jim, look I
really gotta...</i>

241
00:12:46,261 --> 00:12:48,829
<i>I'm in a... I'll talk to
you in a couple days...</i>

242
00:12:48,831 --> 00:12:52,599
Hello?

243
00:12:55,536 --> 00:12:57,170
That's what he meant, that's
what he was thinking about.

244
00:12:57,172 --> 00:12:59,639
Fucking hell.

245
00:12:59,641 --> 00:13:01,608
Hey man.

246
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,342
Fucking asshole.

247
00:13:02,344 --> 00:13:06,346
My broker, phone
keeps dropping out.

248
00:13:06,348 --> 00:13:08,615
Everybody's cheesed
about their broker these days.

249
00:13:08,617 --> 00:13:12,152
Frank and me just learned
that we have lost 20 percent

250
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:13,753
of our pension.

251
00:13:13,755 --> 00:13:16,690
Gone, like watery piss
in the wind.

252
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:20,560
I don't know, bad investments
on the part of idiots like us.

253
00:13:20,562 --> 00:13:22,629
to some of those
administration meetings.

254
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:24,364
Those meetings are bullshit!

255
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:26,199
Our administrators only
do what's good for them,

256
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:28,835
no matter how many people go
to those goddamn meetings,

257
00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:32,873
they should call it
collective ball scratching.

258
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,308
You know what me and Freddy
do with our day?

259
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,578
We bust homeless people for
sleeping in the park, or uh...

260
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,348
we bust some stupid
shmuck for jaywalking,

261
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,883
but the real fucking criminals,

262
00:13:42,885 --> 00:13:45,585
they're downtown
on Wall Street,

263
00:13:45,587 --> 00:13:49,656
wearing suits that cost more
than any of us make in a year.

264
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:52,325
And those mother fuckers steal
more money than any asshole

265
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:54,661
on Riker's Island
ever dreamed of stealing,

266
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:56,229
and if they get caught,
which they won't get caught,

267
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:58,698
but if they did they'd
get an ankle bracelet

268
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,400
and put under house arrest.

269
00:14:00,402 --> 00:14:02,636
In their mansions where
the hookers come to you.

270
00:14:02,638 --> 00:14:04,204
Yeah and they spend
the night.

271
00:14:04,206 --> 00:14:05,705
Well the expensive
kind of hookers

272
00:14:05,707 --> 00:14:07,207
that you want to
spend the night,

273
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:08,608
Wall Street hookers.

274
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,377
Wall Street... pow, pow!

275
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:12,913
Fuck those guys you know
what I mean, fuck them.

276
00:14:12,915 --> 00:14:15,248
Yeah, you guys are doing a
real good job of cheering

277
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,616
my buddy up over here.

278
00:14:16,618 --> 00:14:17,951
Oh, we're just talking shit,
Jim.

279
00:14:17,953 --> 00:14:20,420
I'm sure you'll be all right.

280
00:14:20,422 --> 00:14:22,689
Hey fellas, the usual?

281
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:24,257
I didn't order fries,
that's his.

282
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:26,226
All around.

283
00:14:26,228 --> 00:14:26,793
Beef for you.

284
00:14:26,795 --> 00:14:28,228
Where's my chili?

285
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,762
It's coming!

286
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:29,896
My fucking chili.

287
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,699
Make sure it's warm.

288
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:33,733
It's freezing cold.

289
00:14:33,735 --> 00:14:34,901
Great.

290
00:14:34,903 --> 00:14:36,369
I don't know why we come here,

291
00:14:36,371 --> 00:14:38,638
the food sucks.

292
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,639
But the site's good.

293
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:40,640
At least it's warm.

294
00:14:40,642 --> 00:14:42,509
That's true.

295
00:14:43,644 --> 00:14:46,446
How's Rosie doing, Jim?

296
00:14:46,448 --> 00:14:47,647
She's hanging in there.

297
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:49,282
It's been a tough year,
you know?

298
00:14:49,284 --> 00:14:49,983
She's a fighter.

299
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:51,251
Give her our best.

300
00:14:51,253 --> 00:14:52,385
Yeah.

301
00:14:52,387 --> 00:14:54,654
She's a trooper that one,
Rosie.

302
00:14:54,656 --> 00:14:55,722
She's a good girl.

303
00:14:55,724 --> 00:14:57,958
How's your wife?

304
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,925
Great.

305
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:00,961
She's cheating on me.

306
00:15:00,963 --> 00:15:01,795
What?

307
00:15:01,797 --> 00:15:08,001
If you guys need anything else,
just give me a holler.

308
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:09,669
What happened?

309
00:15:09,671 --> 00:15:12,772
I'm a cop, I got married,
it's inevitable.

310
00:15:12,774 --> 00:15:13,873
It is.

311
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,809
How did you find out?

312
00:15:15,811 --> 00:15:18,478
I read her text messages.

313
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,413
Erotic reading,
let me tell you.

314
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:21,481
Well what are you gonna do?

315
00:15:21,483 --> 00:15:26,953
whoever he is, or to thank him
from the bottom of my heart

316
00:15:26,955 --> 00:15:29,823
for keeping her occupied
and off my back.

317
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:31,725
It's a real conundrum here.

318
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:33,727
Now, can we just talk
about something else, huh?

319
00:15:33,729 --> 00:15:35,695
Talk about his girlfriend.

320
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:37,364
Who, yours?

321
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:41,801
I heard on the news and
they were talking about

322
00:15:41,803 --> 00:15:43,903
who you'd wanna have
sex with, right?

323
00:15:43,905 --> 00:15:49,309
A., your wife or B., before
he could even answer,

324
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:50,043
she could... blah!

325
00:15:51,813 --> 00:15:52,445
I fucked it up.

326
00:15:56,818 --> 00:15:59,786
Husband and wife are
laying in bed...

327
00:15:59,788 --> 00:16:02,722
the wife says to the husband,
"listen, when I die

328
00:16:02,724 --> 00:16:06,760
would you get another
woman in my bed?"

329
00:16:06,762 --> 00:16:09,529
He says, "uh... yeah."

330
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:13,733
She says "uh, well
will you marry her?",

331
00:16:13,735 --> 00:16:16,803
he says "well, maybe".

332
00:16:16,805 --> 00:16:20,807
She says, "will you let
her use my golf clubs?",

333
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:21,808
he says "no!

334
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,876
She's left handed".

335
00:16:24,913 --> 00:16:26,746
You guys wonder why
you're divorced,

336
00:16:26,748 --> 00:16:29,549
Hey, you know you
did it right Jim,

337
00:16:29,551 --> 00:16:31,851
you didn't marry a cop's wife.

338
00:16:31,853 --> 00:16:35,388
You married a girl
you actually love.

339
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,823
Yeah, I hear that.

340
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:40,026
She's a keeper that Rosie,
for sure.

341
00:16:40,028 --> 00:16:42,362
Cheers to you guys.

342
00:16:42,364 --> 00:16:42,962
Cheers.

343
00:16:42,964 --> 00:16:46,366
Jim and Rosie.

344
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:51,771
<i>Simon Johnson, could you
highlight for our viewers</i>

345
00:16:51,773 --> 00:16:55,809
<i>the plutocratic capturing of
American politics?</i>

346
00:16:55,811 --> 00:16:58,545
<i>Well there are several

firm that also has Dan Quayle

353
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,801
Allan Greenspan, head
of the Federal Reserve

354
00:17:21,803 --> 00:17:22,936
leaves to become
a consultant...

355
00:17:24,873 --> 00:17:25,872
Hey girl.

356
00:17:25,874 --> 00:17:26,873
Hey boy.

357
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:27,941
How you feeling?

358
00:17:27,943 --> 00:17:30,810
A little better.

359
00:17:30,812 --> 00:17:32,879
Good.

360
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:35,815
Mostly responsible for
deregulating financial
derivatives

361
00:17:35,817 --> 00:17:38,818
<i>and then proceeds to make
millions of dollars</i>

362
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,821
<i>in hedge funds that invest in
those very same derivatives</i>

363
00:17:41,823 --> 00:17:43,623
<i>that he deregulated.</i>

364
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,825
<i>Henry Paulson, CEO
of Goldman Sachs</i>

365
00:17:45,827 --> 00:17:48,027
<i>leaves Goldman Sachs to join
the Bush government</i>

366
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:50,864
<i>as secretary of treasury
with a 50 million dollar...</i>

367
00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:52,832
I have a treatment
tomorrow, can you make it?

368
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:54,100
Absolutely.

369
00:17:54,102 --> 00:17:56,503
And about the payment,
uh...

370
00:17:56,505 --> 00:17:57,837
Babe, we gotta use
the cards

371
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,472
until we can get
this thing fixed.

372
00:17:59,474 --> 00:18:01,608
Jim, they just raised the
interest rate on the cards

373
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,842
and I've already put some
bills on there, so...

374
00:18:02,844 --> 00:18:03,943
Babe, it's all right.

375
00:18:03,945 --> 00:18:07,847
Well it's just you've been
working so hard lately, and...

376
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:09,616
I know, I know... what
choice do we have?

377
00:18:09,618 --> 00:18:10,917
I'm doing this for us.

378
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:12,185
Okay.

379
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:13,953
You coming to bed?

380
00:18:13,955 --> 00:18:15,488
In a minute.

381
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,890
All right.

382
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:20,593
<i>Chris Dodd, chairman of
the banking committee in
the Senate,</i>

383
00:18:20,595 --> 00:18:23,530
<i>collected 13 million
in campaign funds.</i>

384
00:18:23,532 --> 00:18:26,966
<i>Apparently...</i>

385
00:18:26,968 --> 00:18:30,036
Ahh... ahh!

386
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:07,073
Ouch... All right,
see you next week.

387
00:19:07,908 --> 00:19:09,142
Let's get outta here.

388
00:19:36,203 --> 00:19:38,972
Jim...

389
00:19:38,974 --> 00:19:42,108
What the hell's going on?

390
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:46,980
but your note's been
d-listed from the exchange.

391
00:19:46,982 --> 00:19:49,983
D-listed, what does
that mean?

392
00:19:49,985 --> 00:19:52,585
There's an investigation
going on right now.

393
00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:55,021
Into what?

394
00:19:55,023 --> 00:20:00,226
An investigation into
some investment portfolios.

395
00:20:00,228 --> 00:20:02,228
It looks like a significant
portion of your fund

396
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:08,134
was diverted into paper that
is, well... a little suspect.

397
00:20:08,136 --> 00:20:10,970
Meaning, you don't know...

398
00:20:10,972 --> 00:20:11,971
No, no I don't.

399
00:20:11,973 --> 00:20:13,239
No one knows right now.

400
00:20:13,241 --> 00:20:14,974
You're my broker,
it's what you do.

401
00:20:14,976 --> 00:20:18,745
How could you put my money
into anything suspicious?

402
00:20:18,747 --> 00:20:26,052
I only invest in clean
deals but it seems the firm
itself is behind all this.

403
00:20:26,054 --> 00:20:27,987
Look, I can't really tell
you anything else.

404
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:29,989
This thing is a legal snowball.

405
00:20:29,991 --> 00:20:33,026
Look, we'll just have to wait
until the investigation

406
00:20:33,028 --> 00:20:34,794
is through but it...

407
00:20:34,796 --> 00:20:38,197
I mean it seems that your
investment was good

408
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:42,001
and as it should be but then
everything lost its value.

409
00:20:42,003 --> 00:20:43,736
The question is did
the firm have knowledge

410
00:20:43,738 --> 00:20:46,272
that your original investment
was bad?

411
00:20:46,274 --> 00:20:48,675
You just said you only deal
in clean deals.

412
00:20:48,677 --> 00:20:50,143
I do.

413
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:52,645
I do but I'm the player
here, okay?

414
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:54,180
Not the whole game.

415
00:20:54,182 --> 00:20:58,117
You're not the only one hurting
because of this.

416
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:01,321
the investments of a lot
of unfortunate people...

417
00:21:01,323 --> 00:21:05,358
Unfortunate?!

418
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,093
Unfortunate people?

419
00:21:07,095 --> 00:21:09,028
You told me, you promised me

420
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:12,031
I'd make 8 to 10 percent of
my investment, guaranteed.

421
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:15,034
Yeah, and that is what
my firm told me.

422
00:21:15,036 --> 00:21:18,071
Look, I... I searched it
out, I did my research,

423
00:21:18,073 --> 00:21:24,644
my office manager told me to
put my clients into this.

424
00:21:24,646 --> 00:21:28,047
What else did you put
the money in to?

425
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:30,683
Notes backed by
commercial real estate.

426
00:21:30,685 --> 00:21:33,820
I mean look, these looked
like great buildings...

427
00:21:33,822 --> 00:21:36,155
I checked the specs,
I did the research,

428
00:21:36,157 --> 00:21:39,359
they looked like they'd
be at full capacity, okay?

429
00:21:39,361 --> 00:21:42,662
Did you, did you inspect
these buildings?

430
00:21:42,664 --> 00:21:45,164
Did you inspect these
properties?

431
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,333
The people that do all
the research told me

432
00:21:47,335 --> 00:21:50,203
that this was the real deal.

433
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:52,839
So what do we do now?

434
00:21:52,841 --> 00:21:56,709
We'll get some information
regarding the investigation

435
00:21:56,711 --> 00:22:01,080
and... look, I'm telling you
it's gonna take a while though,

436
00:22:01,082 --> 00:22:02,682
before this whole
thing is clear.

437
00:22:02,684 --> 00:22:05,251
You're telling me I've lost
all my money.

438
00:22:05,253 --> 00:22:07,086
No, not necessarily.

439
00:22:07,088 --> 00:22:10,089
There's gonna be some
large lawsuits.

440
00:22:10,091 --> 00:22:13,393
I just want my money back.

441
00:22:13,395 --> 00:22:16,129
Jim, that's not how
investment works.

442
00:22:16,131 --> 00:22:19,899
I mean, you gotta pay
to play.

443
00:22:19,901 --> 00:22:21,167
This is not a fucking
game to me,

444
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:24,103
this is my fucking life
savings to me, you fuck.

445
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:26,105
Look, I understand.

446
00:22:26,107 --> 00:22:27,707
Hey, I feel your pain,
I do.

447
00:22:27,709 --> 00:22:30,243
I lost a lot of money too.

448
00:22:30,245 --> 00:22:32,745
But that's how investment
works, man.

449
00:22:32,747 --> 00:22:34,247
I'm sorry.

450
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:37,316
It gives and it takes away.

451
00:22:49,196 --> 00:22:51,164
Yeah, how are we doing
with these sales?

452
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:52,198
We're at 20 percent.

453
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,270
I totally agree but the
price is falling.

454
00:22:57,272 --> 00:22:59,872
Oh, Jesus.

455
00:22:59,874 --> 00:23:01,407
The price is falling
to where, nothing?

456
00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:05,178
but our clients are starting
to question our credibility.

457
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,313
Well that's good, some
things never change.

458
00:23:07,315 --> 00:23:10,950
All right, you keep
me posted.

459
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:27,333
Rosie?

460
00:23:27,335 --> 00:23:31,237
Sorry I'm late, I had to cover
for one of the guys at work.

461
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:32,171
Everything okay?

462
00:23:32,173 --> 00:23:34,173
Yeah, it's fine.

463
00:23:34,175 --> 00:23:35,775
You know you can tell me,
you know.

464
00:23:35,777 --> 00:23:38,845
I know.

465
00:23:40,781 --> 00:23:43,483
The bank called.

466
00:23:43,485 --> 00:23:44,383
They did?

467
00:23:44,385 --> 00:23:45,785
What'd they say?

468
00:23:45,787 --> 00:23:47,186
I don't know, the machine
picked it up.

469
00:23:47,188 --> 00:23:49,388
The message said they
needed you to call

470
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,991
or get down there
as soon as possible.

471
00:23:51,993 --> 00:23:54,460
Our mortgage, our interest
rate, something like that.

472
00:23:54,462 --> 00:23:55,928
I mean, I was gonna call...

473
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,798
I'll take care of the bank.

474
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,800
I'll call them tomorrow.

475
00:24:00,802 --> 00:24:03,803
And there's this.

476
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:07,273
It's from my broker.

477
00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:11,310
Jim... what's going on?

478
00:24:11,312 --> 00:24:12,945
Baby, nothing's going on.

479
00:24:12,947 --> 00:24:14,480
Please, you gotta
stop worrying.

480
00:24:14,482 --> 00:24:17,984
Let me take care of the
small stuff, all right?

481
00:24:17,986 --> 00:24:19,852
You need to get well.

482
00:24:19,854 --> 00:24:25,224
Okay, I'm gonna go draw
a bath, play some music,

483
00:24:25,226 --> 00:24:26,359
light some candles.

484
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:27,360
Light some candles?

485
00:24:27,362 --> 00:24:29,495
Yeah, you should join me.

486
00:24:29,497 --> 00:24:30,229
All right.

487
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:32,932
Okay.

488
00:24:45,512 --> 00:24:46,579
Jim, I don't know
what to tell you.

489
00:24:46,581 --> 00:24:51,250
You're the one who said put my
money in bullshit real estate.

490
00:24:51,252 --> 00:24:53,853
It says right here that I am now
liable for another 60 grand.

491
00:24:53,855 --> 00:24:55,254
Are you out of your fucking
mind?

492
00:24:55,256 --> 00:24:57,323
Jim, I told you, no one saw
this coming.

493
00:24:57,325 --> 00:24:59,025
I'm gonna sue you.

494
00:24:59,027 --> 00:25:03,996
Okay just calm down, we'll get
to the bottom of this.

495
00:25:03,998 --> 00:25:06,299
I need you to cover me
for a couple days.

496
00:25:06,301 --> 00:25:07,266
<i>No worries, man.</i>

497
00:25:07,268 --> 00:25:08,334
<i>More problems?</i>

498
00:25:08,336 --> 00:25:09,035
Yeah, something's come up.

499
00:25:09,037 --> 00:25:11,604
No she's fine, I've gotta
take care of a few things.

500
00:25:11,606 --> 00:25:12,405
Okay, take care buddy.

501
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:15,141
All right.

502
00:25:41,068 --> 00:25:42,568
So you invested and you lost,

503
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:45,304
now they want more money
to cover expenses and losses.

504
00:25:45,306 --> 00:25:46,939
I'll file a lawsuit, simple.

505
00:25:46,941 --> 00:25:48,574
So I won't have to pay
the 60 grand?

506
00:25:48,576 --> 00:25:51,477
I'll make sure you don't have
to pay the 60,000

507
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:53,379
or any of the interest they're
laying on top of that,

508
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:56,349
but... your original
investment,

509
00:25:56,351 --> 00:25:58,618
you'll have to talk to
the ADA about that.

510
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:03,322
I think... your ma would
join that case.

511
00:26:03,324 --> 00:26:06,392
Better fucking bet your life
I will.

512
00:26:06,394 --> 00:26:09,328
Now then, I work on
a retainer basis

513
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,330
so I'll need 10 thousand
dollars in advance

514
00:26:11,332 --> 00:26:12,598
to file a civil complaint.

515
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,634
10 grand, I ain't got
10 grand.

516
00:26:14,636 --> 00:26:18,905
No problem, lots of lawyers
work for cheap.

517
00:26:21,341 --> 00:26:23,509
Look Jim, I'm not dealing
with your investment.

518
00:26:23,511 --> 00:26:25,344
It looks like there
has been a crime,

519
00:26:25,346 --> 00:26:27,113
and the DA's office is
dealing with that.

520
00:26:27,115 --> 00:26:29,115
Now if this is true, I'd
be happy to assist you

521
00:26:29,117 --> 00:26:31,017
if you decide to
sue for damages.

522
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:34,420
But we have to start by
filing this complaint

523
00:26:34,422 --> 00:26:38,457
for injunctive relief to protect
you from the 60,000 demand

524
00:26:38,459 --> 00:26:40,393
and the interest it's going
to accumulate.

525
00:26:40,395 --> 00:26:45,531
I'm sorry Jim, but I'm
looking at over 40 hours
of work on your case.

526
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:46,999
Come back when you've
got the 10 grand,

527
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:48,567
that's my minimum.

528
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:50,369
You can borrow the money
or get a credit card

529
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:53,706
but that's the best I can do.

530
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:55,541
Somewhat ironically
I'm like investing.

531
00:26:55,543 --> 00:27:00,980
With attorneys, you
usually get what you pay for.

532
00:27:00,982 --> 00:27:03,382
I'll see what I can do.

533
00:27:03,384 --> 00:27:05,418
Call me!

534
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,487
Or not...

535
00:27:14,461 --> 00:27:15,494
You all right?

536
00:27:15,496 --> 00:27:17,196
Yeah, hanging in there.

537
00:27:17,198 --> 00:27:20,466
Hey, is that back door supposed
to be open?

538
00:27:20,468 --> 00:27:22,034
How you been man?

539
00:27:22,036 --> 00:27:23,135
Hey, what's up man?

540
00:27:23,137 --> 00:27:24,170
Any hold up today?

541
00:27:25,573 --> 00:27:31,410
Same old shit, different day.

542
00:27:31,412 --> 00:27:33,612
they expect you to
pay 60 grand now?

543
00:27:33,614 --> 00:27:37,049
It's happening all over, I lost
18,000 in a mutual fund,

544
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:39,051
college money for my son.

545
00:27:39,053 --> 00:27:41,420
Yeah, my folks lost
their nest egg.

546
00:27:41,422 --> 00:27:43,089
I'm fucked.

547
00:27:43,091 --> 00:27:45,624
Why, you don't have $60,000?

548
00:27:45,626 --> 00:27:47,093
What do you fucking think?

549
00:27:47,095 --> 00:27:50,463
You got family you
could borrow from?

550
00:27:50,465 --> 00:27:51,697
Not an option.

551
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:54,700
but I could scratch
up a few bucks.

552
00:27:54,702 --> 00:27:56,469
Yeah, we could take up a
collection with the guys.

553
00:27:56,471 --> 00:27:58,437
Guys, guys...

554
00:27:58,439 --> 00:28:01,240
I'm just gonna
refuse to pay it.

555
00:28:01,242 --> 00:28:03,542
We gotta get to the job.

556
00:28:03,544 --> 00:28:04,577
Lunch is on me, all right?

557
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:07,446
Allow me.

558
00:28:07,448 --> 00:28:10,449
Thanks guys, I
appreciate it.

559
00:28:10,451 --> 00:28:12,518
Look, hang in there.

560
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,452
It can only get better.

561
00:28:13,454 --> 00:28:16,455
Yeah.

562
00:28:16,457 --> 00:28:17,490
Change?

563
00:28:17,492 --> 00:28:18,624
It's for you, sweetie.

564
00:28:18,626 --> 00:28:20,493
Thanks.

565
00:28:20,495 --> 00:28:24,263
Later.

566
00:28:27,567 --> 00:28:33,639
Jim... I got uh... 10 grand
I can loan you.

567
00:28:33,641 --> 00:28:36,142
Please Jim, listen to me
man.

568
00:28:36,144 --> 00:28:37,510
Sean, forget about it.

569
00:28:37,512 --> 00:28:41,280
Look, I don't have a girlfriend,
I don't have a family,

570
00:28:41,282 --> 00:28:45,618
I don't have anything...
okay?

571
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,754
Please, let me help you out,
it would mean a lot to me.

572
00:28:48,756 --> 00:28:54,493
I might take you up on that,
pay this lawyer.

573
00:28:54,495 --> 00:28:58,564
Just hang in there.

574
00:29:18,285 --> 00:29:20,186
It's called an adjustable rate
for a reason,

575
00:29:20,188 --> 00:29:21,720
when the housing
market changes...

576
00:29:21,722 --> 00:29:24,123
so do the interest rates,
that's how that works.

577
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:26,525
Listen, uh... my premiums have
doubled in the blink of an eye,

578
00:29:26,527 --> 00:29:28,527
I'm not gonna be able to
keep up at this rate.

579
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:30,529
Yeah, you got a favourable
deal when you signed.

580
00:29:30,531 --> 00:29:32,598
The terms of which was that
a specified point in time

581
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,135
the interest rate would
reflect the market.

582
00:29:36,137 --> 00:29:37,536
Can we refinance?

583
00:29:37,538 --> 00:29:42,141
Well your net worth has
taken a significant hit

584
00:29:42,143 --> 00:29:44,143
over the last few
days and your wife,

585
00:29:44,145 --> 00:29:47,546
she hasn't worked for
a year or so, right?

586
00:29:47,548 --> 00:29:49,281
Yeah, she got sick.

587
00:29:49,283 --> 00:29:55,588
But in light of all of that,
refinancing wouldn't be prudent

588
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,556
for our bank at this time.

589
00:29:57,558 --> 00:29:58,557
So you're shafting me?

590
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,859
No, no... it's not me,

591
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:01,861
it's the guidelines
handed down from above.

592
00:30:01,863 --> 00:30:04,630
If it were up to me, I would
help you out.

593
00:30:04,632 --> 00:30:06,599
Uh, you could always try to
sell your house.

594
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:07,833
I can't sell my house
is this market.

595
00:30:07,835 --> 00:30:10,703
I'm sorry, I don't know
what else to tell you.

596
00:30:10,705 --> 00:30:13,172
You could declare bankruptcy,
a lot of people do that.

597
00:30:13,174 --> 00:30:15,374
Fuck you.

598
00:30:15,376 --> 00:30:18,444
That's a fair response,
I suppose.

599
00:30:31,658 --> 00:30:32,658
Hey!

600
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,392
Hey.

601
00:30:33,394 --> 00:30:34,660
You at the bank?

602
00:30:34,662 --> 00:30:35,661
Yeah.

603
00:30:35,663 --> 00:30:37,663
Well what was it about?

604
00:30:37,665 --> 00:30:41,267
Like I said, don't worry
about it.

605
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:41,634
All right?

606
00:30:41,636 --> 00:30:42,668
Mmmhmm.

607
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:46,438
Good.

608
00:31:14,267 --> 00:31:15,668
Ahh... I knew you'd have no
problems coming up with this.

609
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,670
I got it from a friend.

610
00:31:17,672 --> 00:31:20,673
It will and then I'll see if
I can find other investors

611
00:31:20,675 --> 00:31:22,374
who got burned on this

612
00:31:22,376 --> 00:31:24,643
and put together a
collective lawsuit.

613
00:31:24,645 --> 00:31:25,678
Collective ball scratching.

614
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,645
What's that?

615
00:31:26,647 --> 00:31:27,446
It's just a joke.

616
00:31:27,448 --> 00:31:30,316
Not funny, I guess.

617
00:31:30,318 --> 00:31:32,651
Don't underestimate the
power of a large group

618
00:31:32,653 --> 00:31:34,687
when it comes to
asking for damages.

619
00:31:34,689 --> 00:31:36,455
I hope so.

620
00:31:36,457 --> 00:31:38,857
So what do I do about this
letter demanding 60 grand?

621
00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:40,426
I'll contact the other party,

622
00:31:40,428 --> 00:31:41,660
I will let them know
I am your attorney

623
00:31:41,662 --> 00:31:44,663
and that you will
not be paying.

624
00:31:44,665 --> 00:31:48,267
You know, there may be
another way out of this.

625
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:49,935
You take the fall on
this but it could end

626
00:31:49,937 --> 00:31:52,004
all this drama for
you instantly.

627
00:31:52,006 --> 00:31:56,442
Would you be willing to write
off your initial investment

628
00:31:56,444 --> 00:31:59,278
and walk away if these guys
let you out of the 60,000?

629
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,714
It's something you
should consider.

630
00:32:01,716 --> 00:32:03,415
It could be years before
the real estate market

631
00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:04,717
bounces back.

632
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:06,418
If for some reason I can get
the court to grant

633
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,687
injunctive relief to
stop these guys,

634
00:32:08,689 --> 00:32:11,824
years of interest on
this claim against you.

635
00:32:11,826 --> 00:32:13,759
This motion, it's gonna
work right?

636
00:32:13,761 --> 00:32:16,996
Most likely, but nothing
in law is for certain.

637
00:32:16,998 --> 00:32:18,764
I'm just offering
this as an option

638
00:32:18,766 --> 00:32:21,700
but if they're willing to let
you play ball and back off,

639
00:32:21,702 --> 00:32:23,769
then you can put it
all behind you.

640
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:26,038
It'd be nice, huh?

641
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,806
Okay, don't think
about it for too long,

642
00:32:27,808 --> 00:32:29,842
the time to act is now.

643
00:32:29,844 --> 00:32:35,481
You just paid me, I can either
file the complaint as planned

644
00:32:35,483 --> 00:32:38,751
or I can try and negotiate
directly with them

645
00:32:38,753 --> 00:32:41,754
but I need to do one
or the other.

646
00:32:41,756 --> 00:32:44,823
I need a day.

647
00:32:44,825 --> 00:32:46,892
Half a day would be better.

648
00:32:46,894 --> 00:32:48,727
All right, I uh...
I got a meeting

649
00:32:48,729 --> 00:32:50,829
with the assistant
district attorney today.

650
00:32:50,831 --> 00:32:51,730
Oh yeah, good.

651
00:32:51,732 --> 00:32:53,532
I'll put that in the letter.

652
00:32:55,068 --> 00:32:56,869
Thanks.

653
00:32:56,871 --> 00:32:59,938
Let me know what happens.

654
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:48,787
I'm sure I double checked
the schedule when you called

655
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:52,524
doesn't have time in his
schedule for you today.

656
00:33:52,526 --> 00:33:56,795
I'm sorry, I can leave him
a message if you'd like.

657
00:33:56,797 --> 00:33:59,565
Well um, maybe you can answer
a few questions for me.

658
00:33:59,567 --> 00:34:01,834
I'm afraid that I wouldn't
be any help with anything.

659
00:34:01,836 --> 00:34:04,870
I'm not even a legal secretary,
I'm just an assistant.

660
00:34:04,872 --> 00:34:08,073
Just the assistant,
that's your excuse?

661
00:34:08,075 --> 00:34:10,075
Do you have any idea
what's going on here?

662
00:34:10,077 --> 00:34:12,544
Have you heard of my name
at all?

663
00:34:12,546 --> 00:34:13,812
No, I'm sorry sir.

664
00:34:13,814 --> 00:34:14,880
No, I don't.

665
00:34:14,882 --> 00:34:16,014
You haven't.

666
00:34:16,016 --> 00:34:17,082
Myra, coffee please.

667
00:34:17,084 --> 00:34:18,851
I need to speak to you.

668
00:34:18,853 --> 00:34:19,818
Mr. Marwood!

669
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,888
Mr. Marwood is very busy.

670
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,456
Please, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

671
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:25,557
I need to speak to him.

672
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:27,926
Don't make me have
to call security.

673
00:34:27,928 --> 00:34:29,828
I am security,
you fucking bitch.

674
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:33,999
Get your fucking hands
off me.

675
00:35:12,906 --> 00:35:15,941
So... how did it go today?

676
00:35:15,943 --> 00:35:19,077
The bastard didn't have time
for me.

677
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:21,880
You had an appointment, man.

678
00:35:21,882 --> 00:35:23,048
Yeah.

679
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:26,985
You gonna be okay?

680
00:35:32,926 --> 00:35:34,927
<i>You have reached the voicemail
of Patterson Law Group,</i>

681
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:36,895
<i>please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

682
00:35:36,897 --> 00:35:40,966
These bastards, they never
answer their fucking phones.

683
00:35:49,509 --> 00:35:57,950
Hey uh... about the money,
seriously...

684
00:35:57,952 --> 00:36:00,052
don't even worry
about paying me back.

685
00:36:00,054 --> 00:36:02,988
It ain't no thing but
a chicken wing, man.

686
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,189
I appreciate that.

687
00:36:04,191 --> 00:36:05,924
I've done everything,
I went to the DA,

688
00:36:05,926 --> 00:36:11,096
I went to the lawyer...
fucking banks.

689
00:36:11,098 --> 00:36:12,931
The system's rigged
motherfucker!

690
00:36:12,933 --> 00:36:16,001
Come on, you know that shit.

691
00:36:16,003 --> 00:36:20,939
Yeah.

692
00:36:20,941 --> 00:36:24,009
Yeah it is.

693
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:30,749
Let's go get some alcohol,
make the pain go away.

694
00:36:32,252 --> 00:36:34,686
<i>Perhaps the best example
of how this all works</i>

695
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,221
<i>is in the AIG bailout.</i>

696
00:36:36,223 --> 00:36:39,691
<i>When AIG went bankrupt...</i>

697
00:36:47,734 --> 00:36:50,002
Listen lady, I've left him
a ton of messages, a ton.

698
00:36:50,004 --> 00:36:51,737
He's the guy in charge
of prosecuting

699
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:53,038
the brokerage houses,
right?

700
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,706
<i>Yes, that's one of
many cases.</i>

701
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:56,975
Well I need to speak to him
urgently, like right now.

702
00:36:56,977 --> 00:37:01,980
100 cents on the dollar was paid
to the Goldman Sachs debtors.

703
00:37:01,982 --> 00:37:03,248
<i>When a firm goes bankrupt
you don't expect</i>

704
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,983
<i>to get a hundred percent
of those dollars</i>

705
00:37:04,985 --> 00:37:07,319
<i>because it's a bankrupt firm,
it can't pay its debts.</i>

706
00:37:28,274 --> 00:37:30,342
Thank you.

707
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:36,014
You can expect to get maybe 50
cents on the dollar, but no...

708
00:37:36,016 --> 00:37:39,084
<i>the American taxpayer
pays Goldman Sachs</i>

709
00:37:39,086 --> 00:37:41,653
<i>100 cents on the dollar
and all those...</i>

710
00:37:41,655 --> 00:37:48,327
<i>were also secretary
of the treasury.</i>

711
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:54,333
<i>The occupy Wall
Street protests,</i>

712
00:37:54,335 --> 00:37:56,802
<i>a few thousand people,
I do not understand</i>

713
00:37:56,804 --> 00:38:01,039
<i>why the American people are
not up in arms about this.</i>

714
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:03,709
<i>These are criminal acts,</i>

715
00:38:03,711 --> 00:38:08,780
<i>this is blatant fraud
and conflict of interest.</i>

716
00:38:14,054 --> 00:38:16,355
<i>There's no government
investigation,</i>

717
00:38:16,357 --> 00:38:21,126
<i>charges have been laid,
one's even looking into it!</i>

718
00:38:21,128 --> 00:38:24,262
<i>And yet all the information
is there in the open to see.</i>

719
00:38:24,264 --> 00:38:27,332
<i>These are criminals walking
in our midst.</i>

720
00:38:31,871 --> 00:38:34,840
<i>And now the banks want
the same piece of faith</i>

721
00:38:34,842 --> 00:38:36,074
that we have in our government.

722
00:38:36,076 --> 00:38:38,410
<i>The banks have been
trading with ideas,</i>

723
00:38:38,412 --> 00:38:41,680
they just have derivatives and
swaps that move back and forth.

724
00:38:41,682 --> 00:38:43,715
<i>This has to stop,
this can't go on.</i>

725
00:38:43,717 --> 00:38:48,120
<i>We have to underpin our
dealings with actual wealth,</i>

726
00:38:48,122 --> 00:38:51,123
<i>not pieces of paper
that are simply ideas</i>

727
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:54,192
<i>from rich men.</i>

728
00:38:54,194 --> 00:38:54,726
Hey baby.

729
00:38:54,728 --> 00:38:55,727
Hey.

730
00:38:55,729 --> 00:38:57,095
What are you doing here?

731
00:38:57,097 --> 00:38:58,363
You got treatment this
morning, right?

732
00:38:58,365 --> 00:38:59,364
I know, I cancelled it.

733
00:38:59,366 --> 00:39:03,368
Our cards, they declined
last time and the...

734
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,704
the debt people, they've
been calling the house,

735
00:39:05,706 --> 00:39:09,207
so I called the bank and...

736
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:13,412
I know what's going on.

737
00:39:13,414 --> 00:39:15,113
We're broke, aren't we?

738
00:39:15,115 --> 00:39:18,116
We had all of our money
in that fund and it's...

739
00:39:18,118 --> 00:39:21,219
it's gone, isn't it?

740
00:39:21,221 --> 00:39:25,157
Jim...

741
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,725
Jim, it's okay.

742
00:39:26,727 --> 00:39:31,163
I understand, you... you
were just protecting me.

743
00:39:31,165 --> 00:39:33,732
It'll be okay.

744
00:39:33,734 --> 00:39:38,136
I'm gonna get the money back,
I'm gonna fix this.

745
00:39:38,138 --> 00:39:40,305
Oh God, this has been
so hard on you.

746
00:39:40,307 --> 00:39:44,209
You're getting gray hair and
wrinkles all because of me.

747
00:39:44,211 --> 00:39:48,180
It's gonna be all right,
you're gonna be all right.

748
00:39:48,182 --> 00:39:51,450
No, I'm not.

749
00:39:51,452 --> 00:39:55,153
But it's okay.

750
00:39:55,155 --> 00:39:59,958
I just, I really... I wanted us
to have a baby.

751
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,161
You know I know that he
would look just like you

752
00:40:03,163 --> 00:40:05,931
and I couldn't wish
for anything more.

753
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:08,300
Baby, don't say that.

754
00:40:08,302 --> 00:40:13,171
We're gonna sell the house...

755
00:40:13,173 --> 00:40:15,340
Jim...

756
00:40:34,494 --> 00:40:35,827
It'll be okay, it's...

757
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:38,897
I'm calling my lawyer.

758
00:40:43,003 --> 00:40:46,204
Uh, Jim Baxford
for Mr. Patterson.

759
00:40:46,206 --> 00:40:48,206
<i>One moment please.</i>

760
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:52,244
I uh, I got a letter here saying
they're gonna foreclose on us

761
00:40:52,246 --> 00:40:54,980
and uh, the bank's
cutting us off

762
00:40:54,982 --> 00:40:56,381
all because of this
bullshit real estate.

763
00:40:56,383 --> 00:40:58,483
You offered to waive
my investment

764
00:40:58,485 --> 00:41:00,252
if I knocked off the 60 grand.

765
00:41:00,254 --> 00:41:03,321
<i>but you didn't give me
an answer in time.</i>

766
00:41:03,323 --> 00:41:04,823
<i>If I could've gotten
to them earlier...</i>

767
00:41:04,825 --> 00:41:06,224
I called you back
the same fucking day.

768
00:41:06,226 --> 00:41:08,226
<i>At the end of a long
Friday after 4 PM,</i>

769
00:41:08,228 --> 00:41:10,295
<i>if I remember correctly.</i>

770
00:41:10,297 --> 00:41:13,965
That means I didn't get back to
them until Monday or Tuesday,

771
00:41:13,967 --> 00:41:18,236
What about this motion
you filed, the relief thing?

772
00:41:18,238 --> 00:41:20,238
<i>The broker you invested
with went bankrupt</i>

773
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,240
<i>their assets were purchasd
by another company,</i>

774
00:41:22,242 --> 00:41:24,376
<i>there's no one to file a
motion against right now</i>

775
00:41:24,378 --> 00:41:26,444
<i>since the broker's in
bankruptcy you need to hire</i>

776
00:41:26,446 --> 00:41:29,281
a bankruptcy attorney to lift a
thing called an automatic stay,

777
00:41:29,283 --> 00:41:31,349
<i>which really is a pain
in the ass.</i>

778
00:41:31,351 --> 00:41:33,251
What about the real estate
company, what about that?

779
00:41:33,253 --> 00:41:35,320
<i>Well they're also under the
protection of bankruptcy court</i>

780
00:41:35,322 --> 00:41:38,890
<i>It's part of the bankruptcy
law that says you can't take</i>

781
00:41:38,892 --> 00:41:40,992
<i>any action against a
company in bankruptcy</i>

782
00:41:40,994 --> 00:41:43,261
<i>without first hiring another
lawyer and getting permission</i>

783
00:41:43,263 --> 00:41:45,263
from the bankruptcy court.

784
00:41:45,265 --> 00:41:47,332
It's complicated!

785
00:41:47,334 --> 00:41:49,067
Why didn't you tell me
this before?

786
00:41:49,069 --> 00:41:50,335
Why'd I fucking hire you?

787
00:41:50,337 --> 00:41:52,070
<i>I haven't heard from
you in 2 weeks</i>

788
00:41:52,072 --> 00:41:54,306
<i>and certainly wasn't privy to
the inner financial workings</i>

789
00:41:54,308 --> 00:41:59,344
<i>The bankruptcy filings were
just as much a surprise to me.</i>

790
00:41:59,346 --> 00:42:01,079
<i>So let me give you
my best advice...</i>

791
00:42:01,081 --> 00:42:03,381
<i>pay the 60 grand,</i>

792
00:42:03,383 --> 00:42:05,550
I'll file the same injunctive
relief motion we talked about

793
00:42:05,552 --> 00:42:07,352
<i>to try and prevent you
from having to pay</i>

794
00:42:07,354 --> 00:42:11,556
<i>and I won't ask your for any
more money from you for me.</i>

795
00:42:11,558 --> 00:42:13,291
<i>How's that sound?</i>

796
00:42:13,293 --> 00:42:14,359
I don't have 60 grand.

797
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:15,894
<i>Jim, I'll get this one.</i>

798
00:42:15,896 --> 00:42:18,330
<i>Call me later...</i>

799
00:42:18,332 --> 00:42:21,967
This is all my fault.

800
00:42:21,969 --> 00:42:25,437
No, I got sick and I put
us in debt.

801
00:42:25,439 --> 00:42:28,373
It's not your fault, it's
the banks, the CEO's,

802
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:33,912
Jim, I just... I hate what
this is doing to you.

803
00:42:33,914 --> 00:42:37,048
I'm sorry.

804
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,650
I gotta go to work.

805
00:42:38,652 --> 00:42:49,394
Jim... Jim...

806
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,678
Andy, you wanted to see me?

807
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,380
Yeah, come on in.

808
00:43:08,382 --> 00:43:14,519
Close the door please.

809
00:43:14,521 --> 00:43:18,423
Jim... we've been contacted
by a couple of lawyers

810
00:43:18,425 --> 00:43:22,127
and collection agencies in
the last couple of days...

811
00:43:22,129 --> 00:43:23,361
it seems that you have
a lot of debts...

812
00:43:23,363 --> 00:43:24,462
It's not what you think.

813
00:43:24,464 --> 00:43:27,399
They've got a judgment
against you,

814
00:43:27,401 --> 00:43:30,402
a lien to garnish your
wages on a monthly basis.

815
00:43:30,404 --> 00:43:31,369
How much?

816
00:43:31,371 --> 00:43:33,405
You keep 800 per month.

817
00:43:33,407 --> 00:43:37,142
Right, um... let me speak
to my lawyer

818
00:43:37,144 --> 00:43:39,411
before you give these
guys anything.

819
00:43:39,413 --> 00:43:45,517
Jim, I'm sorry but we're gonna
have to let you go.

820
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:48,053
We cannot have employees that
are having financial troubles

821
00:43:48,055 --> 00:43:50,522
protecting our money.

822
00:43:50,524 --> 00:43:52,390
You get what I mean?

823
00:43:52,392 --> 00:43:54,726
We're a bonded firm,
we'll lose our insurance,

824
00:43:54,728 --> 00:43:57,128
we'll lose our clients...

825
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:58,563
we just can't have
you working here,

826
00:43:58,565 --> 00:44:00,565
not under these conditions.

827
00:44:00,567 --> 00:44:07,172
Think of how it looks,
and it's not good.

828
00:44:07,174 --> 00:44:09,407
Severance...

829
00:44:09,409 --> 00:44:12,510
What about my insurance?

830
00:44:12,512 --> 00:44:15,213
You can do COBRA
on the insurance.

831
00:44:15,215 --> 00:44:19,150
That's 600 a month, how
can I keep her alive on that?

832
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:23,555
The check is your
official severance,

833
00:44:23,557 --> 00:44:26,091
but we owe you back pay,
overtime...

834
00:44:26,093 --> 00:44:28,593
you put in a lot of hours and
you've been a loyal employee,

835
00:44:28,595 --> 00:44:32,430
so instead of a check I had
them issue it in cash.

836
00:44:32,432 --> 00:44:34,432
It's a bit of a bump, 9,000.

837
00:44:34,434 --> 00:44:36,568
Cash is better, I figure
banks and collections

838
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:39,437
will never know,
just between us.

839
00:44:39,439 --> 00:44:43,174
I appreciate that.

840
00:44:43,176 --> 00:44:46,244
And I'm gonna need your weapon
and employee ID too.

841
00:45:15,474 --> 00:45:17,075
Jim... hey man, listen...

842
00:45:17,077 --> 00:45:20,278
I'm sorry, I didn't know!

843
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,420
<i>I can't answer the phone
right now,</i>

844
00:48:49,422 --> 00:48:50,688
<i>just leave a message.</i>

845
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:53,424
<i>Have a good day.</i>

846
00:48:54,026 --> 00:48:56,761
Hey Jim what's up,
it's Sean.

847
00:48:56,763 --> 00:48:59,364
Look, I didn't know it was
gonna happen, all right?

848
00:48:59,366 --> 00:49:00,698
I'm really sorry.

849
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:04,769
I love you bro,
please give me a call.

850
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:29,027
Rosie?

851
00:49:41,006 --> 00:49:44,075
Rosie?

852
00:49:47,746 --> 00:49:50,815
Rosie?

853
00:49:52,484 --> 00:49:56,554
Rosie... Baby...

854
00:50:00,826 --> 00:50:01,893
Baby?

855
00:50:06,865 --> 00:50:13,805
Oh my God, baby...

856
00:50:13,807 --> 00:50:16,874
Oh my God, oh no... Rosie?

857
00:50:21,413 --> 00:50:22,613
Rosie...

858
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,858
911...

859
00:50:35,794 --> 00:50:40,131
Rosie, Rosie...

860
00:52:00,546 --> 00:52:04,682
God visits us with
many mysteries in life,

861
00:52:04,684 --> 00:52:08,619
unexpected death is
the most challenging.

862
00:52:08,621 --> 00:52:14,559
when God leaves us speechless
in the face of death,

863
00:52:14,561 --> 00:52:19,163
he reminds us all we have
is forgiveness.

864
00:52:19,165 --> 00:52:23,968
We must set our anger aside
and look to those

865
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:28,906
whom we have lost,
to found a better life.

866
00:52:28,908 --> 00:52:32,910
For who is God,
except the lord,

867
00:52:32,912 --> 00:52:36,013
and who is a rock
besides our God?

868
00:52:36,015 --> 00:52:37,915
The god who girdles
me with strength

869
00:52:37,917 --> 00:52:41,018
and made my way safe.

870
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:44,055
He made my feet like
the feet of a deer

871
00:52:44,057 --> 00:52:47,091
and set me secure
on the heights.

872
00:52:47,093 --> 00:52:49,994
He trains my hands for war

873
00:52:49,996 --> 00:52:53,564
so that my arms can
bend a bow of bronze,

874
00:52:53,566 --> 00:52:56,601
you have given me the
shield of your salvation

875
00:52:56,603 --> 00:52:59,270
and your right hand
has supported me.

876
00:52:59,272 --> 00:53:04,041
Your help has made me great,
you gave me a wide place

877
00:53:04,043 --> 00:53:08,613
for my steps under me
and my feet did not slip.

878
00:53:08,615 --> 00:53:11,983
I pursued my enemies
and overtook them,

879
00:53:11,985 --> 00:53:15,953
and did not turn back
until they were consumed.

880
00:53:15,955 --> 00:53:19,590
I struck them down so that
they were not able to rise,

881
00:53:19,592 --> 00:53:22,059
they fell under my feet

882
00:53:22,061 --> 00:53:24,962
for you girdled me with
strength for the battle.

883
00:53:24,964 --> 00:53:28,733
You made my assailants
sink under me,

884
00:53:28,735 --> 00:53:31,035
you made my enemies
turn their backs to me

885
00:53:31,037 --> 00:53:38,109
and those who hated me,
I destroyed.

886
00:54:10,108 --> 00:54:11,742
<i>Hey, you've got
Jim and Rosie.</i>

887
00:54:11,744 --> 00:54:13,044
<i>We're not home right now
but leave a message</i>

888
00:54:13,046 --> 00:54:16,013
<i>and we'll call you right back.</i>

889
00:54:16,015 --> 00:54:17,748
<i>Hey Jim, it's Sean.</i>

890
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:20,017
<i>Uh, you're not answering
your cell,</i>

891
00:54:20,019 --> 00:54:22,053
<i>are you all right?</i>

892
00:54:22,055 --> 00:54:24,021
<i>I don't really know
what to say but uh,</i>

893
00:54:24,023 --> 00:54:26,290
<i>I'm just thinking of you bro.</i>

894
00:54:26,292 --> 00:54:28,626
<i>I hope you're okay,
I love you.</i>

895
00:54:28,628 --> 00:54:32,229
<i>Please call.</i>

896
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:42,340
<i>Hey, you've got Jim and Rosie.</i>

897
00:54:42,342 --> 00:54:44,041
<i>We're not home right now
but leave a message</i>

898
00:54:44,043 --> 00:54:46,711
<i>and we'll call you right back.</i>

899
00:54:46,713 --> 00:54:49,080
<i>Hey Jim, it's Fred
and Frank.</i>

900
00:54:49,082 --> 00:54:52,316
<i>Listen bud, we'd love to get
together for lunch sometime.</i>

901
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:55,119
<i>We'll come over some
night, watch the game,</i>

902
00:54:55,121 --> 00:54:57,254
<i>do some serious drinking.</i>

903
00:54:57,256 --> 00:55:01,325
<i>We miss you, pal.</i>

904
00:55:52,378 --> 00:55:54,712
Well done, well done!

905
00:55:54,714 --> 00:55:56,847
Thank you to my
lovely secretary

906
00:55:56,849 --> 00:55:58,115
who's been working so hard.

907
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:08,192
I think after last week...

908
00:56:12,165 --> 00:56:15,433
<i>Mr. Marwood is
extremely busy!</i>

909
00:56:18,137 --> 00:56:20,137
It's lovely!

910
00:56:36,923 --> 00:56:37,922
Well maybe it's time
for some of us

911
00:56:37,924 --> 00:56:42,359
to stumble home.

912
00:56:42,361 --> 00:56:44,295
Have a good weekend guys,
you deserve it!

913
00:56:46,232 --> 00:56:47,164
Hello?

914
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:48,466
John, what?

915
00:56:48,468 --> 00:56:50,468
Come on John, it's too late
for that stuff.

916
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:52,770
No, I really don't wanna
talk about this right now,

917
00:56:52,772 --> 00:56:55,239
can you just please call me
tomorrow morning?

918
00:56:55,241 --> 00:56:58,175
All right, all right thank
you.

919
00:56:59,278 --> 00:57:00,845
Mr. Marwood, I'm Jim Baxford.

920
00:57:00,847 --> 00:57:02,313
Yeah.

921
00:57:02,315 --> 00:57:05,316
I left you a bunch of messages,
20 to be exact.

922
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:09,353
I, uh... I'm off the clock
you know, if you wanna talk...

923
00:57:09,355 --> 00:57:12,256
I lost my life savings.

924
00:57:12,258 --> 00:57:15,192
My house, my job, my wife...

925
00:57:15,194 --> 00:57:19,296
Look Jim, it is not my fault
your wife left you, all right?

926
00:57:19,298 --> 00:57:21,465
She didn't leave me,
she's dead.

927
00:57:21,467 --> 00:57:24,335
Oh for fuck... come on man.

928
00:57:24,337 --> 00:57:26,270
I'm telling you...

929
00:57:26,272 --> 00:57:29,974
Just get off of me!

930
00:57:49,228 --> 00:57:53,230
<i>in the stability of the
American economy cuts across</i>

931
00:57:53,232 --> 00:57:55,533
<i>the entire political spectrum.</i>

932

<i>For decades, America

933
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:00,271
<i>unprecedented economic
growth but unfortunately</i>

934
00:58:00,273 --> 00:58:03,440
<i>that growth was fueled
by a mountain of debt</i>

935
00:58:03,442 --> 00:58:06,577
<i>and now those bills are
starting to come due.</i>

936
00:58:06,579 --> 00:58:08,579
<i>As the economic
collapse intensifies,</i>

937
00:58:08,581 --> 00:58:12,383

<i>Call this crisis by

00:58:14,887 --> 00:58:17,354

old game...</i>

<i>the rich still get richer
and the poor get poorer.</i>

941
00:58:21,561 --> 00:58:23,260
Thank you everyone
and good night,

942
00:58:23,262 --> 00:58:25,429
from New York News 7.

943
00:58:25,431 --> 00:58:27,264
<i>Wow, Dan!</i>

944
00:58:27,266 --> 00:58:30,034
<i>This is amazing!</i>

945
00:58:30,036 --> 00:58:32,536
<i>How did you do that?</i>

946
00:58:32,538 --> 00:58:34,405
<i>You know it was really easy</i>

947
00:58:34,407 --> 00:58:37,875
<i>with the new mortgage
incentive rate...</i>

948
00:58:56,596 --> 00:58:59,897
<i>So it looks great, we
got rid of everything.</i>

949
00:58:59,899 --> 00:59:02,900
That's great, fantastic.

950
00:59:02,902 --> 00:59:04,902
And you think that's going
to be enough?

951
00:59:04,904 --> 00:59:06,337
<i>Absolutely, the bank
will look great</i>

952
00:59:06,339 --> 00:59:10,074
but our clients... not so much.

953
00:59:10,076 --> 00:59:12,443
Okay, it's the only
play we had...

954
00:59:12,445 --> 00:59:15,346
we took the shot and
it's looking good.

955
00:59:15,348 --> 00:59:17,047
Am I right?

956
00:59:17,049 --> 00:59:18,616
<i>Yeah, you were right
all along.</i>

957
00:59:18,618 --> 00:59:20,451
Okay, well you know...

958
00:59:20,453 --> 00:59:23,520
that's what I like
to hear, you know?

959
00:59:34,332 --> 00:59:35,466
<i>They can destroy companies
and even countries</i>

<i>The question them becomes...</i>

964
00:59:55,955 --> 00:59:57,488
<i>Like many other
financial institutions,</i>

965
00:59:57,490 --> 01:00:01,091
<i>Leman Brothers got caught
in this financial storm.</i>

966
01:00:01,093 --> 01:00:04,495
<i>The real estate superfund,
which was one of the
hottest products...</i>

967
01:00:04,497 --> 01:00:09,433
<i>7.7 trillion in undisclosed
funds from the Federal Reserve</i>

968
01:00:09,435 --> 01:00:11,368

01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:13,404
<i>We will be watching

970
01:00:13,406 --> 01:00:15,172
<i>there are those that believe</i>

971
01:00:15,174 --> 01:00:16,707
<i>the government does
have a role to play...</i>

972
01:00:16,709 --> 01:00:18,442
<i>I want to be very clear,</i>

973
01:00:18,444 --> 01:00:24,148
<i>I take full responsibility
for the decisions that I made</i>

974
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:27,117
<i>and for the actions
that I took.</i>

975
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:28,419
<i>JP Morgan Chase won</i>

<i>and will assume $31 billion

01:00:31,657 --> 01:00:34,391
<i>The loans came with virtually
no strings attached.</i>

978
01:00:34,393 --> 01:00:36,527
<i>However, eventually the
bottom dropped out sharply</i>

979
01:00:36,529 --> 01:00:39,396
<i>and suddenly, leaving
investors little...</i>

980
01:00:39,398 --> 01:00:45,569
The government stepped in

981

<i>Continue to squander
millions of dollars...</i>

982
01:00:48,174 --> 01:00:52,543

01:00:55,014 --> 01:00:57,548
<i>We're not home right now
but leave a message</i>

984
01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:00,150
<i>and we'll call you right back.</i>

985
01:01:00,152 --> 01:01:02,720
<i>Mr. Baxford, it's Walt
from the bank calling...</i>

986
01:01:02,722 --> 01:01:05,422
<i>uh, we've sent you letters and
left you numerous messages</i>

987
01:01:05,424 --> 01:01:08,025
<i>about your mortgage default.</i>

988
01:01:08,027 --> 01:01:09,426

<i>the bank has no choice
at this time</i>

990
01:01:11,163 --> 01:01:13,030
<i>but to foreclose on your home.</i>

991
01:01:13,032 --> 01:01:16,433
<i>If you've got any questions,
feel free to contact me.</i>

992
01:01:16,435 --> 01:01:19,103
<i>We're not home right now
but leave a message</i>

993
01:01:19,105 --> 01:01:23,574
<i>and we'll call you right back.</i>

994
01:01:23,576 --> 01:01:26,443
<i>I'm not answering
the phone no more,</i>

995
01:01:26,445 --> 01:01:30,514
<i>so stop fucking calling,
I don't wanna talk to you.</i>

996
01:01:38,724 --> 01:01:41,592
Mr. Baxford.

997
01:01:50,068 --> 01:01:52,469
James Baxford.

998
01:01:56,542 --> 01:01:59,209
Are you James Baxford?

999
01:01:59,211 --> 01:02:03,113
Notice of eviction
due to foreclosure.

1000
01:02:03,115 --> 01:02:04,481
You like doing this,

1001
01:02:04,483 --> 01:02:07,084
kicking people out
on the street?

1002
01:02:07,086 --> 01:02:08,752
I'm sorry sir, but you're gonna
have to sign this document

1003
01:02:08,754 --> 01:02:10,487
and pack up your things.

1004
01:02:10,489 --> 01:02:13,757
You will have 48 hours
to vacate the premises.

1005
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:15,759
Sir, if you and your belongings
are not out of here

1006
01:02:15,761 --> 01:02:18,595
in 48 hours, the sheriff will be
here to remove you forcibly,

1007
01:02:18,597 --> 01:02:21,632
so you should sign this.

1008
01:02:24,235 --> 01:02:27,304
Take this piece of paper
and shove it up your ass.

1009
01:02:28,807 --> 01:02:32,076
That's fine Mr. Baxford, but
you've been legally served.

1010
01:04:30,762 --> 01:04:32,729
And no loud music!

1011
01:04:34,632 --> 01:04:36,700
And that's not working,
take the stairs.

1012
01:04:45,977 --> 01:04:48,779
Speaking of work,
how's Jim?

1013
01:04:48,781 --> 01:04:50,914
I don't know...

1014
01:04:50,916 --> 01:04:54,918
I'll give him a call,
see how he's doing.

1015
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,987
He's been on my mind lately.

1016
01:05:17,876 --> 01:05:20,877
<i>Hey Jim, we've been thinking
about you!</i>

1017
01:05:20,879 --> 01:05:24,815
Here I'm gonna put you
on speaker, okay?

1018
01:05:24,817 --> 01:05:26,950
Hey man, we miss you
at lunch.

1019
01:05:26,952 --> 01:05:28,685
<i>Yeah, you should come
join us.</i>

1020
01:05:28,687 --> 01:05:31,488
I need more time guys,
a little more time.

1021
01:05:31,490 --> 01:05:33,690
Well you take all
the time you need,

1022
01:05:33,692 --> 01:05:35,325
we just want you to know
we're all there for you.

1023
01:05:35,327 --> 01:05:36,693
Yeah, don't run away from us,

1024
01:05:36,695 --> 01:05:38,428
we're gonna help you
get back on your feet.

1025
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:40,964
I really appreciate it guys,
I'll see you soon.

1026
01:05:40,966 --> 01:05:42,032
All right.

1027
01:05:42,034 --> 01:05:42,866
All right, man.

1028
01:05:42,868 --> 01:05:46,003
Bye.

1029
01:06:52,937 --> 01:06:54,805
These are the 2 pieces
you were asking about,

1030
01:06:54,807 --> 01:06:58,108
did you bring the dollars?

1031
01:06:59,777 --> 01:07:01,878
Looks good.

1032
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,380
So where'd you serve?

1033
01:07:03,382 --> 01:07:04,848
10th...

1034
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:05,916
Keith Stack referred me.

1035
01:07:05,918 --> 01:07:07,417
Stack's a good soldier.

1036
01:07:07,419 --> 01:07:08,051
Yeah.

1037
01:07:08,053 --> 01:07:11,388
Don't forget your clips.

1038
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:12,856
Hey, I gotta ask you...

1039
01:07:12,858 --> 01:07:14,057
Are you in any way,
shape or form

1040
01:07:14,059 --> 01:07:15,859
associated with
law enforcement?

1041
01:07:15,861 --> 01:07:17,828
I ain't no cop, I'm
just a private citizen

1042
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:19,930
concerned about his personal
safety, all right?

1043
01:07:19,932 --> 01:07:22,399
Yeah...

1044
01:07:22,401 --> 01:07:23,533
Grenades?

1045
01:07:23,535 --> 01:07:26,069
Oh yeah, I got 2 left,
shrapnel.

1046
01:07:26,071 --> 01:07:27,971
How much?

1047
01:07:27,973 --> 01:07:32,542
I'll sell you both for
a hunsky.

1048
01:07:32,544 --> 01:07:34,611
For personal protection?

1049
01:07:34,613 --> 01:07:36,012
For fun.

1050
01:07:36,014 --> 01:07:37,881
Grenades are fun!

1051
01:07:37,883 --> 01:07:41,151
You take it easy.

1052
01:09:49,213 --> 01:09:50,981
Hey asshole!

1053
01:09:59,091 --> 01:10:03,093
the vice president of a
well-known brokerage firm

1054
01:10:03,095 --> 01:10:05,962
<i>was gunned down
while walking to his car.</i>

1055
01:10:05,964 --> 01:10:08,064
<i>The killing appears to
have been targeted,</i>

1056
01:10:08,066 --> 01:10:10,767
<i>our correspondent is on
the scene with an update.</i>

1057
01:10:10,769 --> 01:10:13,136
<i>Thank you, this is a
developing story, uh...</i>

1058
01:10:13,138 --> 01:10:15,305
<i>there are no suspects
at this time,</i>

1059
01:10:15,307 --> 01:10:18,108
<i>however it is believed the
victim may have been targeted</i>

1060
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:20,977
<i>because of his involvement
in the financial sector.</i>

1061
01:10:20,979 --> 01:10:23,079
<i>Police are still looking for
clues and a spokesperson</i>

1062
01:10:23,081 --> 01:10:25,015
<i>for them released a statement
earlier today saying</i>

1063
01:10:25,017 --> 01:10:27,150
<i>they're treating this as...</i>

1064
01:10:35,159 --> 01:10:38,662
A majority of American voters
now believe the United States

1065
01:10:38,664 --> 01:10:41,998
<i>could experience a total
economic collapse.</i>

1066
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,734
<i>Various types of loans
became available to consumer</i>

1067
01:10:44,736 --> 01:10:47,003
<i>who happily assumed
an unprecedented debt.</i>

1068
01:10:47,005 --> 01:10:50,040
<i>...The latest Wall Street firm
to receive federal money</i>

1069
01:10:50,042 --> 01:10:54,611
<i>It's about morality, we
can't let these guys win,</i>

1070
01:10:54,613 --> 01:10:56,046
and also we want our money back

1071
01:10:56,048 --> 01:10:57,614
<i>from the United
States government.</i>

1072
01:10:57,616 --> 01:10:59,049
<i>They gave the banks bailouts,</i>

1073
01:10:59,051 --> 01:11:01,151
<i>we want our bailouts.</i>

1074
01:11:04,623 --> 01:11:06,022
The law firm Leman Brothers
currently in bankruptcy

1075
01:11:06,024 --> 01:11:08,024
billed over 850 million
in legal fees,

1076
01:11:08,026 --> 01:11:11,161
in addition for billing in
massage and lobster dinners.

1077
01:11:11,163 --> 01:11:14,064
<i>Around 20 lawyers made
over 40 million each</i>

1078
01:11:14,066 --> 01:11:16,700
<i>before the people who actually
lost money got anything.</i>

1079
01:11:16,702 --> 01:11:19,202
<i>The really amazing thing here
is that the government</i>

1080
01:11:19,204 --> 01:11:21,638
<i>awarded them the contract
in the first place,</i>

1081
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:24,140
<i>without making sure
they had the capital</i>

1082
01:11:24,142 --> 01:11:26,042
<i>to cover these costs.</i>

1083
01:11:26,044 --> 01:11:28,912
<i>The people are angry
and rightly so.</i>

1084
01:12:01,346 --> 01:12:08,084
<i>Find out in our full report
right after the break.</i>

1085
01:12:08,086 --> 01:12:11,821
<i>...This speculation drove
the value of the fund up...</i>

1086
01:12:49,427 --> 01:12:51,928
Charlotte are you reading this?

1087
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:53,263
Let's get some personal
security in this office

1088
01:12:53,265 --> 01:12:54,764
for me right now!

1089
01:12:54,766 --> 01:12:58,168
Of course.

1090
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:02,138
You've gotta be kidding me.

1091
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:03,139
Hey, look at this!

1092
01:13:03,141 --> 01:13:04,140
Jim!

1093
01:13:04,142 --> 01:13:06,409
What up man?

1094
01:13:06,411 --> 01:13:07,343
How you doing man?

1095
01:13:07,345 --> 01:13:08,745
Dude!

1096
01:13:08,747 --> 01:13:09,312
How you doing?

1097
01:13:09,314 --> 01:13:10,413
Good man.

1098
01:13:10,415 --> 01:13:11,881
Hey Jim, good to see you.

1099
01:13:11,883 --> 01:13:13,183
How you doing, all
right?

1100
01:13:13,185 --> 01:13:14,150
Yeah, I'm good.

1101
01:13:14,152 --> 01:13:15,418
Pretty good.

1102
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:18,188
Oh come on, you don't have
to do that.

1103
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:20,890
I just fucking did,
I miss you guys.

1104
01:13:20,892 --> 01:13:22,225
Yeah, me too.

1105
01:13:22,227 --> 01:13:23,326
Lunch hasn't been the same.

1106
01:13:23,328 --> 01:13:24,427
So what's been going on?

1107
01:13:24,429 --> 01:13:26,162
Not a lot, not a lot..

1108
01:13:26,164 --> 01:13:28,431
you know just been hanging.

1109
01:13:28,433 --> 01:13:30,467
I ain't been working.

1110
01:13:30,469 --> 01:13:33,937
It's tough you know, with
Rosie gone and shit...

1111
01:13:33,939 --> 01:13:36,239
it's not good.

1112
01:13:36,241 --> 01:13:38,274
You know, it is what it is.

1113
01:13:38,276 --> 01:13:41,778
Anyway, so uh...
I'm moving.

1114
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:43,480
Moving? Where to?

1115
01:13:43,482 --> 01:13:47,183
I don't know, different city,
different state.

1116
01:13:47,185 --> 01:13:50,987
Everywhere I go I keep seeing
Rosie.

1117
01:13:50,989 --> 01:13:52,255
It's driving me nuts.

1118
01:13:52,257 --> 01:13:53,223
You get it, right?

1119
01:13:53,225 --> 01:13:54,190
I get it.

1120
01:13:54,192 --> 01:13:56,493
Hell, I understand.

1121
01:13:56,495 --> 01:13:59,929
I feel like doing the same
thing sometimes.

1122
01:13:59,931 --> 01:14:02,866
No, I don't know why
the hell she won't go.

1123
01:14:02,868 --> 01:14:04,000
It's a mystery to me!

1124
01:14:04,002 --> 01:14:05,201
She fucking loves you.

1125
01:14:05,203 --> 01:14:07,303
Oh yeah, she loves me.

1126
01:14:07,305 --> 01:14:09,205
She loves you, she loves
everybody in the neighbourhood,

1127
01:14:09,207 --> 01:14:10,206
that's the problem!

1128
01:14:10,208 --> 01:14:11,241
She hasn't bailed
on him yet.

1129
01:14:11,243 --> 01:14:13,209
She loves me, right.

1130
01:14:13,211 --> 01:14:17,213
Well you gotta tell us
where you're going, all right?

1131
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:21,551
with all these fucking
shootings, huh?

1132
01:14:21,553 --> 01:14:24,254
Yeah, it's a hell of a thing.

1133
01:14:24,256 --> 01:14:27,257
The whole city's on alert,
look at that.

1134
01:14:27,259 --> 01:14:29,492
Yeah, the brass is afraid
it's gonna escalate.

1135
01:14:29,494 --> 01:14:32,428
Really, they'll get him
soon enough.

1136
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:34,831
They'd better, the brass
is screaming.

1137
01:14:34,833 --> 01:14:38,001
Whoever it is really fucking
hates rich bankers,

1138
01:14:38,003 --> 01:14:39,869
which only leaves
a million suspects.

1139
01:14:39,871 --> 01:14:41,237
You know whoever
catches this guy

1140
01:14:41,239 --> 01:14:43,239
is gonna get a big promotion,
my man.

1141
01:14:43,241 --> 01:14:45,241
Well in that case,
I'll save you the trouble.

1142
01:14:45,243 --> 01:14:49,412
What the fuck are you
talking about?

1143
01:14:49,414 --> 01:14:52,515
It's me.

1144
01:14:55,387 --> 01:14:57,987
Okay, you had me going for
a minute there, all right?

1145
01:14:57,989 --> 01:15:00,456
I'm serious.

1146
01:15:04,329 --> 01:15:07,063
You'll give me a heart attack,
what's wrong with you?

1147
01:15:07,065 --> 01:15:09,299
All right, who got the
Reuben?

1148
01:15:09,301 --> 01:15:10,400
Always with the fingers,
huh?

1149
01:15:10,402 --> 01:15:11,868
Sorry.

1150
01:15:11,870 --> 01:15:14,404
Don't want that, I'm gonna get
an STD from this sandwich.

1151
01:15:14,406 --> 01:15:18,007
You ruined it for me,
I'm serious.

1152
01:15:18,009 --> 01:15:20,310
I'm afraid to eat this sandwich,
I'm gonna get a herpe.

1153
01:15:20,312 --> 01:15:21,411
You should put a condom
on your finger,

1154
01:15:21,413 --> 01:15:23,613
that's what you should do.

1155
01:15:23,615 --> 01:15:27,584
I think she's been going to
the gym, you notice that?

1156
01:16:33,484 --> 01:16:36,386
My wife's ready to pop!

1157
01:16:36,388 --> 01:16:38,354
I got him a membership
to our country club,

1158
01:16:38,356 --> 01:16:40,356
it was like 90,000 plus.

1159
01:16:40,358 --> 01:16:41,691
That is crazy.

1160
01:16:41,693 --> 01:16:42,959
You're crazy.

1161
01:16:42,961 --> 01:16:44,360
I owe you too much money.

1162
01:16:44,362 --> 01:16:46,396
Hey, did you hear Stancroft...

1163
01:18:02,439 --> 01:18:04,474
Hey Robert!

1164
01:18:04,476 --> 01:18:06,576
It's Jim, Jim Baxford.

1165
01:18:06,578 --> 01:18:07,610
Jim Baxford!

1166
01:18:07,612 --> 01:18:09,545
Hey, it's good to see you.

1167
01:18:09,547 --> 01:18:14,117
from that little financial
disaster of ours.

1168
01:18:14,119 --> 01:18:16,452
Not quite, but
I'm getting there.

1169
01:18:16,454 --> 01:18:18,755
Well it was a tough time man,
we all took a loss.

1170
01:18:18,757 --> 01:18:22,258
I mean, when I told my wife we
couldn't vacation in Barbados,

1171
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:25,061
she tore a strip off me
the size of Long Island.

1172
01:18:25,063 --> 01:18:27,563
But things get better,
right?

1173
01:18:27,565 --> 01:18:29,632
Right, that's what everyone
keeps telling me.

1174
01:18:29,634 --> 01:18:31,801
Trust me, it's true.

1175
01:18:31,803 --> 01:18:36,472
Look, um... let me give
you my new business card,

1176
01:18:36,474 --> 01:18:39,509
There we go, I've got a couple
of uh, investment ideas

1177
01:18:39,511 --> 01:18:41,210
you might be interested in.

1178
01:18:41,212 --> 01:18:43,279
I'll take you for lunch
next week, huh?

1179
01:18:43,281 --> 01:18:46,482
I gotta run, it was good
to see you.

1180
01:18:46,484 --> 01:18:47,216
Hey you too.

1181
01:18:47,218 --> 01:18:49,352
Yeah, call me.

1182
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:03,499
<i>Next caller,
go ahead please.</i>

1183
01:19:03,501 --> 01:19:05,568
<i>I'm glad those bankers
got shot.</i>

1184
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:08,538
<i>There's no effective laws
in this country anymore,</i>

1185
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:11,107
<i>you get 5 years for
robbing a gas station,</i>

1186
01:19:11,109 --> 01:19:13,276
<i>you destroy America...</i>

1187
01:19:13,278 --> 01:19:15,278
<i>you get 20 trillion
dollars and you walk away?</i>

1188
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,513
<i>Violence is not
the solution, Gus.</i>

1189
01:19:17,515 --> 01:19:20,516
<i>Isn't violence the official
solution of our government
in Iraq,</i>

1190
01:19:20,518 --> 01:19:21,317
<i>Afghanistan?</i>

1191
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:24,520
Thanks for your comments,
Gus.

1192
01:19:24,522 --> 01:19:25,588
<i>Next caller, who's on the
line?</i>

1193
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:27,256
<i>Why'd you cut Gus off?</i>

1194
01:19:27,258 --> 01:19:30,660
<i>I lost my house and Wall Street
is getting a free ride...</i>

1195
01:19:34,532 --> 01:19:36,132
<i>Okay, that's all
the time we have</i>

1196
01:19:36,134 --> 01:19:37,533
<i>on today's show for
call ins.</i>

1197
01:19:37,535 --> 01:19:39,535
<i>Let's look at today's market,</i>

1198
01:19:39,537 --> 01:19:42,605
<i>the US dollar is trading
at 1.31 against...</i>

1199
01:20:10,701 --> 01:20:11,767
Robert here.

1200
01:20:11,769 --> 01:20:13,569
Robert, it's Jim.

1201
01:20:13,571 --> 01:20:14,704
Jim, how you doing?

1202
01:20:14,706 --> 01:20:18,641
but I won 50 G in
a poker tournament.

1203
01:20:18,643 --> 01:20:20,743
Fucking unbelievable.

1204
01:20:20,745 --> 01:20:23,713
Anyway, I need some
advice on what to put it in.

1205
01:20:23,715 --> 01:20:26,649
Oh great, well how
about we have a coffee?

1206
01:20:26,651 --> 01:20:27,683
<i>The place near my office?</i>

1207
01:20:27,685 --> 01:20:28,718
Yeah, same coffee shop.

1208
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:30,186
<i>Okay.</i>

1209
01:20:30,188 --> 01:20:30,720
See you tomorrow, 9 o'clock.

1210
01:20:30,722 --> 01:20:31,587
<i>Sounds great.</i>

1211
01:20:31,589 --> 01:20:33,923
All right, see you then.

1212
01:25:40,997 --> 01:25:42,898
Yeah but you see,
you see uh...

1213
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:44,900
8-5-6, that's gotta jump
up to 9-2-5.

1214
01:25:44,902 --> 01:25:47,937
No, no... look at the, look
at the right screen.

1215
01:25:47,939 --> 01:25:50,906
No, we gotta sell those shares
right away.

1216
01:25:50,908 --> 01:25:54,643
drop off the other side, we
need more points on that side.

1217
01:25:54,645 --> 01:25:56,712
Shit... I'm not
the boss here...

1218
01:25:56,714 --> 01:26:00,783
You have absolutely no say
in this.

1219
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:09,058
Please, my wife...
she's pregnant.

1220
01:26:12,997 --> 01:26:16,599
Maggie, get a hold of
security now!

1221
01:26:16,601 --> 01:26:18,000
Hey, what the fuck
is going on?

1222
01:26:21,205 --> 01:26:24,707
Get back to your wife and be
thankful, you prick.

1223
01:26:24,709 --> 01:26:26,075
Get the fuck outta here!

1224
01:26:26,077 --> 01:26:28,110
Go!

1225
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:45,160
Hurry, hurry run!

1226
01:26:45,162 --> 01:26:47,162
Go!

1227
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:44,813
Copy that, 38th floor!

1228
01:28:44,815 --> 01:28:46,882
38th floor!

1229
01:28:56,693 --> 01:28:59,128
Police are looking into whether
or not today's shooting spree

1230
01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:01,764
has anything to do
with the recent murders.

1231
01:29:01,766 --> 01:29:04,700
Now from what we know, all
of the victims were involved

1232
01:29:04,702 --> 01:29:07,136
in the brokerage scandal
but there was a question

1233
01:29:07,138 --> 01:29:10,105
whether or not the fraud
charges could be prosecuted.

1234
01:29:10,107 --> 01:29:13,175
We know that the shooter
is still in the building
at the moment.

1235
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:24,119
Get outta here.

1236
01:29:24,121 --> 01:29:25,854
Out!

1237
01:29:25,856 --> 01:29:28,991
Get out!

1238
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:39,468
Whatever it is you want,
this is not the way to get it.

1239
01:29:39,470 --> 01:29:45,240
Take a fucking seat,
right there.

1240
01:29:45,242 --> 01:29:48,310
Sit the fuck down.

1241
01:29:52,949 --> 01:29:56,752
Bet you've never seen your
desk from that angle before.

1242
01:29:56,754 --> 01:30:02,257
I don't know who you
think it is I am but...

1243
01:30:02,259 --> 01:30:04,426
this isn't gonna
accomplish anything.

1244
01:30:04,428 --> 01:30:07,196
Did I tell you to speak?

1245
01:30:07,198 --> 01:30:08,263
You wanna know the difference

1246
01:30:08,265 --> 01:30:10,199
between a banker
and a gangster?

1247
01:30:10,201 --> 01:30:15,237
A gangster always
has a getaway plan.

1248
01:30:15,239 --> 01:30:17,306
Okay...

1249
01:30:21,177 --> 01:30:26,281
And by the way... I
know exactly who you are.

1250
01:30:26,283 --> 01:30:28,283
You are the guy who fucks
everyday people in the ass

1251
01:30:28,285 --> 01:30:32,321
when you're not sitting in your
fucking house in the Hamptons,

1252
01:30:32,323 --> 01:30:34,256
or booking tennis lessons
from your penthouse

1253
01:30:34,258 --> 01:30:37,292
overlooking Central Park.

1254
01:30:37,294 --> 01:30:39,194
How do you know all this?

1255
01:30:39,196 --> 01:30:42,264
I've been watching you.

1256
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:45,534
The problem with guys like you

1257
01:30:45,536 --> 01:30:47,202
is you can't stop bragging.

1258
01:30:47,204 --> 01:30:51,507
you're making sure that every
magazine in the country

1259
01:30:51,509 --> 01:30:54,476
knows all about
your triumphs.

1260
01:30:54,478 --> 01:30:58,013
Well, you know there are people
that derive inspiration

1261
01:30:58,015 --> 01:30:59,815
from success stories.

1262
01:30:59,817 --> 01:31:01,350
You know maybe you'd do all
the same things I've done

1263
01:31:01,352 --> 01:31:02,484
given the opportunity.

1264
01:31:02,486 --> 01:31:04,019
No, I wouldn't.

1265
01:31:04,021 --> 01:31:05,521
I wouldn't sell bad
loans to people

1266
01:31:05,523 --> 01:31:09,224
with small amounts of money.

1267
01:31:09,226 --> 01:31:10,259
You make yourself
real cash based

1268
01:31:10,261 --> 01:31:14,263
on fabricated
nonexistent loans.

1269
01:31:14,265 --> 01:31:16,565
You cook the books to
get your bonuses,

1270
01:31:16,567 --> 01:31:18,367
that's what you fucks do.

1271
01:31:18,369 --> 01:31:22,337
But the question is,
why should I let you live?

1272
01:31:22,339 --> 01:31:27,976
You're a salesman, right?

1273
01:31:27,978 --> 01:31:29,244
Sell me.

1274
01:31:29,246 --> 01:31:31,980
Sell you...

1275
01:31:31,982 --> 01:31:33,248
You know that there's
not a person on this earth

1276
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:36,285
that's worth over a
hundred million dollars

1277
01:31:36,287 --> 01:31:39,288
that came by
that money honestly?

1278
01:31:39,290 --> 01:31:43,025
The Vanderbilts, the Carnegies,
the Gettys,

1279
01:31:43,027 --> 01:31:46,862
the Morgans, the Hursts,
the Rockafellers...

1280
01:31:46,864 --> 01:31:51,266
They just annexed territories
and licenses and businesses

1281
01:31:51,268 --> 01:31:52,601
and killed the native
population

1282
01:31:52,603 --> 01:31:54,870
and imported slaves
and sold guns

1283
01:31:54,872 --> 01:31:57,272
to both the north and the
south during the Civil War

1284
01:31:57,274 --> 01:32:04,346
and they're heroes,
they're American heroes!

1285
01:32:04,348 --> 01:32:07,482
Take 5 on 38.

1286
01:32:07,484 --> 01:32:11,553
Coming down, proceeding
to locate target.

1287
01:32:14,290 --> 01:32:16,625
We teach our children, what...
honesty and hard work

1288
01:32:16,627 --> 01:32:18,360
are the keys to success?

1289
01:32:18,362 --> 01:32:20,629
My children... my children are
not gonna go off to some war,

1290
01:32:20,631 --> 01:32:23,031
they're gonna go to Yale,
they're gonna go to Harvard.

1291
01:32:23,033 --> 01:32:25,901
And it's gonna be the dumb,
stupid, white trash kids

1292
01:32:25,903 --> 01:32:28,337
and the black ghetto kids
that are gonna fight

1293
01:32:28,339 --> 01:32:31,306
America's senseless wars
and they're gonna protect

1294
01:32:31,308 --> 01:32:34,443
American security and business,
and it's gonna be my business.

1295
01:32:34,445 --> 01:32:38,380
richer and richer and
my bonuses are gonna
get bigger and bigger,

1296
01:32:38,382 --> 01:32:42,451
and it's the same old story.
It's the bankers and the owners

1297
01:32:42,453 --> 01:32:44,453
and the advisors that get rich!

1298
01:32:44,455 --> 01:32:46,488
And it's the little people,
who buy their stock

1299
01:32:46,490 --> 01:32:49,424
and always lose in the end.

1300
01:32:49,426 --> 01:32:55,063
To people like you!

1301
01:32:55,065 --> 01:32:58,333
Some people don't recover,
people like me.

1302
01:32:58,335 --> 01:33:01,136
It's a free trade system,
my friend.

1303
01:33:01,138 --> 01:33:02,671
That's capitalism.

1304
01:33:02,673 --> 01:33:06,008
That's competition in
a capitalist society,

1305
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:10,145
that's how the cream
always rises to the top.

1306
01:33:10,147 --> 01:33:15,217
That's how the strong survive
and the weak die off.

1307
01:33:24,427 --> 01:33:27,396
Like her?

1308
01:33:27,398 --> 01:33:28,363
That's my wife
you're looking at,

1309
01:33:28,365 --> 01:33:30,499
she's dead because of you.

1310
01:33:30,501 --> 01:33:32,467
Come on... I don't give a fuck,

1311
01:33:32,469 --> 01:33:35,637
I have never seen you before
in my life.

1312
01:33:35,639 --> 01:33:37,973
But you do know about the real
estate growth superfund,

1313
01:33:37,975 --> 01:33:40,409
That's where you put
your money.

1314
01:33:40,411 --> 01:33:44,379
For the commissions,
for the commissions.

1315
01:33:44,381 --> 01:33:46,581
That's how it works.

1316
01:33:50,186 --> 01:33:51,119
You like competition?

1317
01:33:51,121 --> 01:33:52,387
I love competition.

1318
01:33:52,389 --> 01:33:54,389
You wanna play a little
free market competition,

1319
01:33:54,391 --> 01:33:55,590
just you and me?

1320
01:33:55,592 --> 01:33:57,159
You and me?

1321
01:33:57,161 --> 01:34:00,228
I can't wait.

1322
01:34:01,164 --> 01:34:05,400
One weapon, two guys.

1323
01:34:05,402 --> 01:34:08,070
Winner lives...

1324
01:34:18,214 --> 01:34:21,216
On the count of 3...

1325
01:34:21,218 --> 01:34:25,287
1... 2...

1326
01:34:28,491 --> 01:34:29,424
Well, lookie here!

1327
01:34:29,426 --> 01:34:30,625
I came out on top.

1328
01:34:30,627 --> 01:34:32,527
That's what you
don't understand,

1329
01:34:32,529 --> 01:34:35,430
What's important is that I won,

1330
01:34:35,432 --> 01:34:39,501
doesn't matter how I won,
and you're dead.

1331
01:34:40,436 --> 01:34:43,171
I cheated too.

1332
01:34:51,448 --> 01:34:54,716
Get him outta here!

1333
01:34:54,718 --> 01:34:58,186
Target located and eliminated.

1334
01:36:41,290 --> 01:36:42,557
<i>I'm still alive and free</i>

1335
01:36:42,559 --> 01:36:45,560
<i>and I promise I
will keep killing.</i>

1336
01:36:45,562 --> 01:36:47,662
<i>They should all know
that I am out there,</i>

1337
01:36:47,664 --> 01:36:49,631
<i>a soldier of the people...
and if the government,</i>

1338
01:36:49,633 --> 01:36:53,368
<i>the prosecutors and the
judges fail on their duty,</i>

1339
01:36:53,370 --> 01:36:56,438
<i>I will not fail on mine.</i>
