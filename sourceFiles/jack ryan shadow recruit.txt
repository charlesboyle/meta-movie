1
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,770
Did you see what's happening?

2
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,885
Come on, come on, let's go!

3
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,641
Hey, what's going on?

4
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,922
In there. It's on the news.

5
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,679
<i>Then, 18 minutes later,</i>

6
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,359
<i>a second one went into
the other twin tower.</i>

7
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,359
<i>Can you paint us a picture of
the situation in New York...</i>

8
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,519
<i>An everyday morning situation,
presumably pretty busy in the streets,</i>

9
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,719
<i>people going about their business.</i>

10
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,119
<i>Well, it's a beautiful
day here in New York.</i>

11
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,599
<i>Everyone is out in the street,
everyone's on their rooftops,</i>

12
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,719
<i>everyone's on their mobile phones.</i>

13
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,479
<i>I don't think people can quite
believe what's happened.</i>

14
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,399
<i>Given that this is the financial district,
is it your understanding that people...</i>

15
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,239
You're American, aren't you?
Sorry, mate.

16
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,559
<i>May actually be inside
the World Trade Center?</i>

17
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,079
<i>I mean, without a shadow of a doubt</i>

18
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,599
<i>there will be people in there.
They get to work very early.</i>

19
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,239
<i>And what about the
emergency services?</i>

20
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,559
<i>I, John Patrick Ryan,</i>

21
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,119
<i>do solemnly swear that
I will support and defend</i>

22
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,599
<i>the Constitution of the United States
against all enemies, foreign and domestic,</i>

23
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,565
<i>that I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same</i>

24
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,439
<i>and that I will obey the orders of
the President of the United States</i>

25
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,199
<i>and the orders of the
officers appointed over me</i>

26
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,519
<i>according to regulations and the
Uniform Code of Military Justice,</i>

27
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,279
<i>so help me, God.</i>

28
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,679
- Come on, then!
- I got one!

29
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,479
- Let's hear it!
- Richmond Webb.

30
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,559
You serious?

31
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,479
My man was a seven-time Pro Bowler.

32
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,999
I'm just saying Brown's better.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,119
Man, how come every cat from Baltimore
always got to bring up Orlando Brown?

34
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,841
Because Brown's the most underrated
offensive tackle in the business.

35
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,479
- Have you ever seen him play?
- What? Aw, man.

36
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,330
Yes, this is Lieutenant Ryan.

37
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,199
Yes, sir, I did. I was wondering

38
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,999
if you had a chance to forward my
report on the Saabir Khan Bridge

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,079
to anyone in intel.

40
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,799
Yes, sir, they are the same
findings I already reported.

41
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,959
I just can't help noticing a correlation
between traffic patterns there

42
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,321
and the region's other...

43
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,799
Well, if they do respond,

44
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,129
I would be happy to explain it to
whoever's in charge of regional...

45
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,040
Sir?

46
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,319
Still no love from the C.O.?

47
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,799
I don't get it. I'm
just trying to help.

48
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,479
Hey, guys. Buckle up in the back.

49
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,799
We're running into a
little turbulence.

50
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,919
You all right there, Private?

51
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,479
- Sir, yes, sir!
- Good man!

52
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,519
Man, I still don't get why
you requested this detail.

53
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,239
Big brain like yours, man, why aren't
you behind some desk somewhere?

54
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,759
You requested this?

55
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,959
I just figured if I was gonna
serve, I should serve.

56
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,759
Man, that's some patriotic shit
right there, you see that?

57
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,399
You're all right, Lieutenant.
Even if your team is wack.

58
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,001
Oh, stop talking trash
on my Ravens, homeboy.

59
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,639
I'm a Bengals fan.

60
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,839
The Bengals?

61
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,759
Rookie, get that harness on
and stop trying to be down.

62
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,999
Man, you got a lot
to learn, Davies.

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,879
Left in, right twist, click.

64
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,241
Thank you, sir!

65
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,046
You want some help?

66
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,879
Move, move, move!

67
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,639
Chopper crash. Spinal
cord should be okay,

68
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,839
but he's got two shattered vertebrae
and no feeling in his legs.

69
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,121
Lieutenant Ryan!

70
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,286
Lieutenant Ryan! Did anyone
else make it out alive?

71
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,119
Yeah, two. Ryan dragged
them both out.

72
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,759
With a broken back?

73
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,079
Okay, we're gonna have a look at
you and it's gonna hurt, okay?

74
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,719
X-rays are on the board.

75
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,759
Okay, turn him!

76
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,479
Okay, clear him!

77
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,519
Down on three. One, two, three.

78
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,719
Can't do anything from here.

79
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,879
Evac him to NATO trauma
in Kandahar right now.

80
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,479
Get an ear out to Dr. Hardesty.
Tell him to prep for a foraminotomy

81
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,359
or possible spondylolisthesis.

82
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,599
We've got spinal compression
and root damage at minimum.

83
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,039
Lieutenant has about a 90-minute
window if he wants to walk again.

84
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,159
Okay, move, move!

85
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,519
Let's go. Come on, come on!

86
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,960
Out of the way! Out of the way!

87
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,930
That guy's done in this war.

88
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,845
Gently.

89
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,800
Push more to the next level.

90
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,961
Good.

91
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,399
That's really good, Jack.

92
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,679
Come on. You can do this.

93
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,919
Get up.

94
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,043
I don't like you very much, Doctor.

95
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,919
I'm not a doctor.
I'm a 3rd-year med student

96
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,488
who is four credits short in
P.T. until you decide to walk.

97
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,844
You're sick. You're a sadist.

98
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,170
Come on, meet me halfway.

99
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,525
Give me two Percocet.

100
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,648
Get up and I'll ask them for one.

101
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,399
How long's he been here?

102
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,965
Eight months.

103
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,171
Think he'll ever walk
without the crutches?

104
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,206
Maybe.

105
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,364
If he decides he has
somewhere to go.

106
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,763
I'd like to talk to him.

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,645
Sure.

108
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,411
Not yet.

109
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,890
But soon.

110
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,405
Will you do me a favor and wait
two minutes before you take that?

111
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,641
Why?

112
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,163
So that you know you can.

113
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,319
- Lieutenant Ryan?
- Uh... Yes, sir?

114
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,599
Please, at ease.

115
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,246
Commander Thomas Harper, U.S. Navy.

116
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,524
Why the uniform today?

117
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,519
I beg your pardon?

118
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,719
I mean, you were wearing a suit and
tie the last time you were here.

119
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,127
You watched me from behind
the glass in rehab.

120
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,164
What can I do for you, Commander?

121
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,919
You've already done it.

122
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,805
I just want to say thank
you for your service.

123
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,446
I appreciate that.

124
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,125
John P. Ryan, right?

125
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,119
That's right.

126
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,290
The one who wrote <i>Liquidity
Events in Post-Soviet Markets?</i>

127
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,959
Two-thirds of it, yes.
My, uh... My dissertation.

128
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,759
The same John P. Ryan who
filed three separate reports

129
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,119
on traffic patterns in and
around the Saabir Khan Bridge?

130
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,679
Uh, yes, sir.

131
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,484
It's impressive work.

132
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,400
How did you get a
hold of that, sir?

133
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,968
I'm in the CIA.

134
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,281
Jack?

135
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,081
Oh, hey.

136
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,971
So, this is, uh...
This is good-bye.

137
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,163
I'm glad I found you.

138
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,490
No more P.T. work for you?

139
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,360
No, just eye-doctoring.

140
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,251
Congratulations.

141
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,202
I'm hungry.
You wanna buy me dinner?

142
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,159
You know I can't.

143
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,647
All right, you win. I'll buy.

144
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,279
I'll make you a deal.

145
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,961
The day you run all the way out
of here, we'll have dinner.

146
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,204
And split the check.

147
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,281
See ya.

148
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,767
See ya.

149
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,047
Good luck.

150
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,084
Jesus, you weren't kidding.
You are in the CIA.

151
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,689
Somebody has to be.

152
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,042
Why didn't you finish your Ph.D.?

153
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,370
- I joined the Marines.
- And saved two of your men.

154
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,281
You handled yourself like a hero.

155
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,361
If you still want to
serve your country,

156
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,444
there's another way.

157
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,810
You're not really in
the CIA, are you?

158
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,090
What are you? Treasury?
Foreign Asset Control?

159
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,919
You know, I'm not supposed to tell
anybody what I do for a living.

160
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,964
And now, look,
I've just told you twice.

161
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,010
What do you want from me?

162
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,919
I want to send you back to
school to finish your doctorate.

163
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,679
Then you'll join Financial
Intelligence as an analyst.

164
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,799
You'll work in a series of
private banks on Wall Street,

165
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,368
where you'll use your position to
uncover funding for terror groups.

166
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,159
Covertly.

167
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,569
Yep. So you have to
keep it to yourself.

168
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,399
Your employers won't
know you work for us.

169
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,239
The people you love won't
know you do, either.

170
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,044
It's gonna get lonely,

171
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,363
but it's how we like to do things.

172
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,129
You know, people don't like you
guys very much these days.

173
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,639
Waterboarding. Rendition.

174
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,126
Not my unit.

175
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,439
Come on. You can do
better than that.

176
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,846
I can.

177
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,599
And I do. And so do the
people in my unit.

178
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,290
Which unit is that?

179
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,530
The one that makes sure
we don't get hit again.

180
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,999
I knew.

181
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,959
I knew when you saw me
ride it, you'd want one.

182
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,207
Mmm.

183
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,728
- Nice.
- Yeah.

184
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,239
Oh, her name's Sarah, by the way.

185
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,319
Who?

186
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,199
The one you like in Arbitrage.

187
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,279
How'd you know that?

188
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,324
Why else would anybody
buy a motorcycle?

189
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,439
- Teddy Hefferman?
- Sarah, yes.

190
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,439
Jack Ryan said you could help
me with the Balfour arbitrage.

191
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,559
- How're you doing?
- Hi.

192
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,325
Uh, what do you have?

193
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,084
This looks good.

194
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,719
<i>The World Bank urging caution</i>

203

<i>The big question,
will the U.S. defy Russia?</i>

204
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,719
The only thing that the
Turks and the Georgians

205
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,479
would undermine with their pipeline

206
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,839
is Russia's monopoly on the Eastern
European natural gas market.

207
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,919
We both know that.

208
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,727
If you block our proposal and
the pipeline is approved,

209
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,479
oil falls below $79 a barrel and the
Russian government goes bankrupt.

210
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,079
In our judgment, your
assessment is extreme.

211
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,441
Thank you.

212
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,602
Our request comes from my
country's highest level.

213
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,884
And it is respectfully
denied from mine.

214
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,279

as an act of economic war.

- He'll want you.
- No, I'm just an analyst.

225
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,319
Our Russian partners are
hiding accounts from us.

226
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,000
It's, um, all in the data.

227
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,479
Nobody else understands the data.

234
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,720

235
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,800
Jack?

236
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,399
You home yet?

237
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,439
I bet you looked cute.

238
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,199

00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,799
<i>Well, surprised,</i>

00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,319
<i>pleased certainly, but this is extremely
unusual behavior by the market.</i>

244
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,319
<i>Commodities should be moving in the
opposite direction of the dollar.</i>

245
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,639
<i>You'd see a very different

248
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,211
Yeah. Yeah, it was good.
Sorry about that. Yeah.

249
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,764
So, you feel like a
movie this weekend?

250
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,281
Sure.

251
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,719
There's a revival of Sony, Wrong
Number at the Film Forum.

252
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,809
I was thinking that might be fun.

253
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,926
Uh...

254
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,081
Yeah.

255
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,760
Have you ever seen it?

256
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,606
Um...

257
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,607
You know what I haven't seen
is the waiter for, like,

258
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,119
10 minutes. Have you seen him?

259
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,319
- No.
- Where'd he run off to?

260
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,039
Okay. So, should we go?

261
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,129
- Sounds good.
- Good.

262
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,886
Yeah. Let's do it.

263
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,519
- For you, sir?
- Ah. Yeah, the lady will try it.

264
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,166
Yes, I will try it. Thank you.

265
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,080
Sorokin wants to meet you now.

266
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,041
Ten minutes.

267
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,321
Yes, Minister.

268
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,321
I warned them of the
outcome at the U.N...

269
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,168
it was entirely predictable.

270
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,561
It was a mistake for
us to force a vote.

271
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,528
You started moving assets when the

272
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,925
vote went against us, I hope?

273
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,647
Yes, Minister.

274
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,447
You understand the Kremlin must
remain entirely distanced.

275
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,525
Anything you activate

276
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,845
must be self-contained.

277
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,927
Is it the hour for 'Lamentations'?

278
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,040
Lamentations?

279
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,806
The Russian government
is unaware...

280
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,209
of any such activity or operation.

281
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,047
But of course.

282
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,399
You want to go to Moscow?

283
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,719
I think we have to.

284
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,519
They're unnamed, uncategorized,
scattered all over the world.

285
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,324
They're hidden accounts, Rob.

286
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,679
These are just the ones
I managed to find.

287
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,927
How did you find them?

288
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,451
- You pay me to look.
- Not to look that hard.

289
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,720
Joke.

290
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,160
- You think they're ripping us off?
- I don't know what to think.

291
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,807
Jesus H. Christ.

292
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,768
You're the compliance officer. It's
your call, but can I ask one thing?

293
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,970
Don't screw up the most lucrative
partnership this company has.

294
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,282
Please? I'm not kidding.

295
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,131
Viktor Cherevin is
completely unpredictable.

296
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,519
And it's Russia.

297
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,319
Insider trading is legal over
there. It's the Wild West.

298
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,285
They're still ideologues, but
the new ideology is money.

299
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,159
They're not a country,
they're a corporation.

300
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,439
Which is why we're there
in the first place.

301
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,639
- I know, don't rock the boat.
- It's not a boat.

302
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,079
It's a goddamn luxury yacht
and we're all on it together.

303
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,009
So, don't fucking sink us.

304
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,359
Why don't you want me to come?

305
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,119
Because I think you'd be
bored out of your mind.

306
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,759
It's Moscow. How would I be bored?

307
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,883
I'll be working the whole time.

308
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,645
What about Paris?

309
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,089
- What about Paris?
- Well, it isn't boring.

310
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,005
And you won't be working.

311
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,204
They owe me a long weekend. You can
meet me there when you're done.

312
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,642
What do I have to do to
take a vacation with you?

313
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,009
You can marry me and
call it a honeymoon.

314
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,082
Why didn't you tell
me about the movie?

315
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,681
What?

316
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,319
Sony, Wrong Number.
You'd already seen it.

317
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,965
There was a stub in your pocket.

318
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,479
You went through my pockets.

319
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,799
Oh.

320
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,279
I folded your pants because
you throw them on the floor

321
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,960
- and what I asked you...
- Why won't you just marry me, Cathy?

322
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,964
Are you having an affair?

323
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,879
Oh, God, no. No.

324
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,599
Is that what this is?
Is that what you think?

325
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,799
Who did you see the movie with?

326
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,439
By myself.

327
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,999
I'm a compliance officer.
I do everything by myself!

328
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,159
It was a 1:45 show.

329
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,959
I couldn't stare at the goddamn
computer screen anymore.

330
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,687
You know what? If the job isn't right for
you, Jack, maybe it's time to move on!

331
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,440
Paris.

332
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,046
You and me.

333
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,771
Okay?

334
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,999
Dr. Ryan. Embee Deng.

335
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,884
Private security for
Cherevin Group.

336
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,402
I'm your protective detail.

337
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,079
I need a bodyguard?

338
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,648
Think of me as your fancy driver.

339
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,879
- Where are you from, Embee?
- Uganda.

340
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,199
Cherevin only hires
foreigners for security.

341
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,847
That way they know we're not FSB.

342
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,366
Good afternoon, good afternoon.

343
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,201
Mmm-hmm.

344
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,170
This way, Mr. Deng.

345
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,639
Wow, St. Basil's
Cathedral. Beautiful.

346
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,519
It locks like ice cream.
Ice cream top.

347
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,719
The Kremlin.

348
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,119
Yes, yes.

349
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,323
Ah, you speak some Russian.

350
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,479
You go and register. I'll help
you upstairs with the bags.

351
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,879
No. That's okay.
I can get it from here.

352
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,599
I'm supposed to check the room.

353
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,926
Okay.

354
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,169
- Welcome, Mr. Ryan.
- Hi.

355
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,971
- Just your signature, please.
- All right.

356
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,839
Mr. Cherevin hopes the room
will be to your satisfaction.

357
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,847
Ah, yes. And the view
is second to none.

358
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,845
Wow.

359
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,559
It's magnificent!

360
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,679
This is Cornerback.
I have a situation.

361
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,166
<i>You have 85 seconds.</i>

362
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,919
- I need help.
<i>- Category?</i>

363
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,439
Somebody tried to kill me.
There's a body.

364
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,719
<i>Are you intact?</i>

365
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,159
Close enough.

366
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,479
<i>Location?</i>

367
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,839
<i>Cornerback?</i>

368
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,759
Uh, the Grushnitsky Hotel, Moscow.

369
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,399
Oh, no.

370
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,199
<i>15 to 20 minutes.</i>

371
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,449
<i>Maintain the room.
Wait for two rings, then exit.</i>

372
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,199
<i>Go quiet until 21:30 local and
surface at location Gamma.</i>

373
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,519
I, uh...

374
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,599
<i>Contact bench at the
base of the stairs.</i>

375
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,088
I don't remember where that is.

376
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,079
<i>Confirm.</i>

377
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,479
I heard you, I just don't
remember the address, okay?

378
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,159
I'm just an analyst. I only
did three weeks at the Farm.

379
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,199
<i>You are breaking
protocol, Cornerback.</i>

380
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,559
I'm out of my goddamn
element is what I am.

381
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,199
I just need the address.

382
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,079
<i>Go back to your room and stay there
until the phone rings twice.</i>

383
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,999
<i>Then leave quickly and quietly.</i>

384
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,239
<i>Keep out of sight until
9:30 local time.</i>

385
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,479
<i>- Then, go to Staraya Square, the steps.</i>
- Okay.

386
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,879
<i>Your contact will be on the bench.</i>

387
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,319
<i>Cornerback?</i>

388
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,646
Yeah.

389
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,199
<i>You're a Marine.</i>

390
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,839
<i>It's the reason you're
still alive right now.</i>

391
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,930
<i>Remember your tradecraft
and you'll be fine.</i>

392
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,919
Thank you.

393
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,079
<i>Time's up.</i>

394
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,079
Hey, I was just about to call you.

395
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,159
Hey.

396
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,439
Yeah, I only landed a
couple hours ago, so, uh...

397
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,405
<i>Oh, good. I'm not trying
to hassle you, I just...</i>

398
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,039
<i>I just wanted to make
sure the trip was okay.</i>

399
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,561
Yeah. Yeah, it was,
you know, uneventful.

400
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,559
Well, that's the best kind.

401
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,879
<i>So, what are you doing now?</i>

402
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,686
I, uh, just left
the hotel. Gonna...

403
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,083
Got to go meet a colleague.

404
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,646
Anybody interesting?

405
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,687
I don't think you know him.
What are you up to?

406
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,399
<i>Well, I was just on call for a 48,</i>

407
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,446
<i>but Saidelman says that he can
cover me for the weekend.</i>

408
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,199
<i>So I thought,</i>

409
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,847
if I got on a plane tonight,
I could be in Paris in the morning.

410
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,560
You think you could get away early?

411
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,046
Uh...

412
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,406
Hello?

413
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,447
Yeah, you know, I, um...

414
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,439
<i>I don't think so, Cath.</i>

415
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,759
<i>I think I'm gonna be tied
up longer than I thought.</i>

416
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,039
I'm not, uh...

417
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,919
I'm not sure I'm gonna be
able to make it there at all.

418
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,526
Well, it sounds like
you're having fun.

419
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,723
Look, sweetheart, I'm, uh...

420
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,879
I'm late and I'm tired.
I'm pretty jetlagged.

421
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,881
Can I give you a call in
the morning, my time?

422
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,966
Okay.

423
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,651
I love you desperately.
You know that, don't you?

424
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,641
Yep.

425
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,650
Don't lose faith in me.

426
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,486
Okay.

427
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,000
You Okay?

428
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,560
Sit down.

429
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,763
You got to pick somebody to
trust, Jack. Now, sit down.

430
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,161
You brought your dog?

431
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,679
Q.P. dog.

432
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,043
Quasi-Personal. Why else
am I out for a walk?

433
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,999
Grabbed it out of somebody's yard.

434
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,010
They'll be thrilled when he
turns up in the morning.

435
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,325
It's better they're shaking
afterwards than during.

436
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,165
First person I ever killed,
Jack, was innocent.

437
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,400
- What did he do?
- She.

438
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,325
She didn't do anything.
She was a bystander.

439
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,124
Somebody who just...

440
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,960
Just came up behind me too quick.

441
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,966
Jesus.

442
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,562
How do you get over
something like that?

443
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,242
If you're lucky, you get past it.

444
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,559
- That's not the same thing.
- No, it isn't.

445
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,525
Now talk me through
your very scary memo,

446
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,401
but keep in mind I
don't have your Ph.D.

447
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,079
Two weeks ago, I noticed a series of
accounts in our Russian partner's records

448
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,363
to which our company's
computers are denied access.

449
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,768
Massive currency accounts,

450
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,999
all in U.S. Treasuries.

451
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,839
Cherevin's made a total
commitment to U.S. dollars

452
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,039
when there's been a
hurricane in the Gulf

453
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,641
and a string of negative
economic reports.

454
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,919
What does it mean?

455
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,839
It's external sterilized
intervention.

456
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,399
Like I'm an idiot, please?

457
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,968
The dollar should be
going down, but it's up.

458
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,641
A few cents every
day, the past week.

459
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,291
I think they're propping us up.

460
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,007
Why?

461
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,643
I think there's a coordinated
plot within Russia

462
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,759
to collapse the dollar and
crash the U.S. economy.

463
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,247
And it's going to happen soon.

464
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,119
It'll be timed to follow a
terrorist attack on U.S. soil.

465
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,959
No, that'd be crazy.
The Russians would lose

466
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,919
- as much as anybody in a collapse.
- No. No, no, no,

467
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,282
the Chinese will lose more.

468
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,959
And once the Russians
start to sell,

469
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,642
the rest of the world is gonna
dump every dollar they have.

470
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,559
All right, let's say it's happened.
Let's say you're right.

471
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,479
What's the aftermath?

472
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,761
They'll recover.

473
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,643
We won't. We don't have
their oil reserves.

474
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,119
We're looking at the Panic of 1837,

475
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,439
the Panic of 1893,
the Soviet Famine of 1932.

476
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,599
Hyperinflation.

477
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,959
Bread lines. Rioting.

478
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,525
I know, I get it.

479
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,359
And at first, though, they'll
call it the American crisis,

480
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,321
but within about six weeks, they're
gonna start calling it what it is.

481
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,410
The Second Great Depression.

482
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,520
The attack and the sell-off
have to be timed to each other.

483
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,479
A massive series of transactions like
that have to be programmed in advance

484
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,489
and stored in Cherevin's system.

485
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,679
Once I start the audit,
I can get the date

486
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,848
and time of the attack
down to the minute.

487
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,722
You stick to the scheduled
audit tomorrow.

488
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,322
Everything official,
everything in public.

489
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,966
You'll be fine.

490
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,204
I need for you to be fine.

491
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,001
Your room should be clean by now.
We'll put a watch on it.

492
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,971
I drowned him.

493
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,409
In about that much water.

494
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,251
You know, you sold
this as an office job.

495
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,962
You're not just an analyst anymore.

496
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,725
You're operational now.

497
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,842
We will avenge our mother Russia.

498
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,442
You will avenge our family.

499
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,968
America will bleed.

500
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,164
Good luck, Aleksandr.

501
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,081
Everyone is in place, sir,
in America and in Moscow.

502
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,810
Let it begin.

503
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,999
Hi. Jack Ryan to see Mr. Cherevin.

504
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,119
One moment, please.

505
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:14,011
Dr. Ryan? I'm Katya, Mr. Cherevin's
assistant. He's expecting you.

506
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,799
I may be here a few days.
Will I get my own card?

507
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,561
Oh... As a foreign guest,
you'll need to be accompanied.

508
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,851
You understand?

509
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,127
Of course.

510
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,879
Viktor Cherevin.

511
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,206
Jack Ryan.

512
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,884
- How was your flight?
- Fine, thank you.

513
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,844
And the jet lag?

514
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,888
That first night can be brutal.

515
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,606
I survived.

516
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,050
That's a nice painting.
Napoleon at war.

517
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,244
So, you know your history.

518
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,165
What can I do for you?

519
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,240
Routine audit.

520
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,921
So routine it couldn't
be done from New York?

521
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,040
Not when you're concealing
accounts from us.

522
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,723
You Americans like to think
of yourselves as direct.

523
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,367
But I wonder if perhaps
you are just rude.

524
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,801
You Russians think of yourselves as
poets, but perhaps you're just touchy.

525
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,210
Nothing here is concealed.
Only secured.

526
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,966
Excuse me.

527
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,564
I hope I can count on full
access to your account files?

528
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,480
You won't need it.

529
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,679
I ordered the companies which concerned
you, quite unnecessarily, I might add,

530
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,599
to be sold, at a profit.

531
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,879
Your firm's percentages are
detailed in this report.

532
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,359
The funds were transferred
this morning,

533
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,599
too late, alas, to stop you
from getting on your flight.

534
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:51,041
So, you see, an audit would be quite
without purpose at this point, Mr. Ryan.

535
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,966
I see.

536
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,401
Partnerships are
delicate, Mr. Ryan.

537
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,608
Sometimes, they end violently.

538
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,007
Dimitri Lemkov,
our head of security.

539
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,846
Jack Ryan.

540
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,330
I'm sorry you had to come all
this way for nothing, Mr. Ryan.

541
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:22,164
I hear the finest restaurant in
Moscow is across the street. Um...

542
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,719
In honor of our partnership
and to, quite frankly,

543
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,924
apologize for my mistake,

544
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,404
perhaps I could take you to dinner.

545
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,841
No.

546
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,281
But I'll take you.

547
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,845
And I insist my driver pick
you up from your hotel.

548
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,168
Moscow can be very dangerous.

549
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,879
Our own man, for example, who collected
you from the airport. Embee.

550
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,839
We are very concerned.
He has simply disappeared.

551
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,079
I'm sorry to hear that.

552
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:57,923
No doubt he will turn up in a day
or two, hung-over and remorseful.

553
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,441
Will your wife be
joining us tonight?

554
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,201
Uh...

555
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,650
- I'm not married.
- Oh.

556
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,487
I was just told that she
had arrived at your hotel.

557
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,959
Uh, my girlfriend.

558
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,049
Even better, and our little secret.

559
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,799
You're having fun with me.

560
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,731
Not nearly enough. Bring her along
tonight. We won't go otherwise.

561
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,725
I'll be sure to ask.

562
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,605
A pleasure to have met you both.

563
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,931
He's dangerous.

564
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,361
I lost him.

565
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,599
You're done already?

566
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,759
He's outplayed us.

567
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,405
You didn't get anything?

568
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,606
Nothing. Not one thing.

569
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,647
He sold all the assets.

570
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,199
He probably moved them to
other shell companies.

571
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,641
But I can't audit what they
technically don't own.

572
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,927
- All right. We still need the algorithm.
- Yeah.

573
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,643
Yeah. I invited him to dinner.

574
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,166
The restaurant is across the
street from his building.

575
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,324
What if we, uh...

576
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,719
What if what?

577
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,799
- I don't know.
- What, Jack?

578
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,199
Well, what if we...

579
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,479
You wanna break into their system?

580
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,119
- Yeah, I think someone should.
- You think we can?

581
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,559
Yeah... I don't know.

582
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,119
Put it up, the restaurant.

583
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,119
The orders to sell
the dollar would be

584
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,641
encrypted on the computer
of the security director.

585
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,371
Dimitri Lemkov?

586
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,359
Former FSB.

587
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,839
We can't break into his office.

588
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,279
It's secured six different ways.

589
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,209
So, what about the
office next to his?

590
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,799
Well, that's Cherevin's.

591
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,999
Can we get into that?

592
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,999
Maybe someone could if
they had his access card.

593
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,119
We're developing a security
guard, but we don't have him yet.

594
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,685
Well, develop harder.

595
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,199
He drinks, right?

596
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,686
Like a Russian.

597
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,569
Also chases women. The
more married, the better.

598
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,879
Okay, tell your guy
once he's in there,

599
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,039
he needs to enable all encrypted
financial sell order packages.

600
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,527
Tell him to look for
dark pool algorithms.

601
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,361
And if your guy, if the guy...

602
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,524
I'm the guy, aren't I?

603
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,964
Yeah. You're going to be great.

604
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,883
But you've got another
problem, Jack.

605
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,999
So I dropped everything, and I
called in every favor that I knew

606
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,647
and I spent four hours at the
consulate begging for a visa.

607
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,759
You know, I wanted to
make this grand gesture.

608
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,079
I wanted you to see
what you meant to me.

609
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,567
So, I'm here.

610
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,561
And you have to say something.

611
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:22,287
Well, maybe it's... Maybe it's
awful or hurtful or shameful.

612
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,241
I don't know. But you
have to talk to me.

613
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,847
You can't let me think
that I'm crazy anymore.

614
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,562
Because now I know that I'm not.

615
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,610
Just talk to me.

616
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,085
Will you meet me halfway?

617
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,850
I'm in the CIA.

618
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,205
Thank God.

619
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,207
I thought you were
having an affair.

620
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,999
Is everything in place?

621
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,919
Yes, Mr. Cherevin, our asset in
the U.S. has been contacted.

622
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,201
He's prepared?

623
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,919
Yes, sir. Merely
awaiting your order.

624
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,044
We will strike... tomorrow.

625
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:28,006
Very well, sir. Sell orders
have all been entered.

626
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,687
It's time.

627
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,930
We will activate our
asset immediately.

628
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,919
And this must be Aleksandr.

629
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,770
The prodigal returns.

630
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,759
He may not be a regular churchgoer,
but he's a good man, my son.

631
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,639
He just turned 21.

632
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,571
And he already has a
job at the auto plant.

633
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,249
It was stupid to mention the job.

634
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,999
A real mother would.

635
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,202
It wasn't necessary.

636
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,319
Today's reading is from the
Book Of Lamentations...

637
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,239
chapter 2, verse 2...

638
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,090
Lamentations.

639
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,324
We've been activated.

640
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,043
Thank God.

641
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,371
He has torn down the strongholds

642
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,359
of the daughter of Judah.

643
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,919
He has brought her kingdom...

644
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,999
and its princes down to
the ground in dishonor.

645
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,202
The timing of the attack
has been brought forward.

646
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,561
We leave tonight.

647
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,281
Take nothing with you.

648
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,803
There is one loose
end to tie up first.

649
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,999
<i>Playing the hottest
music in Detroit.</i>

650
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,039
<i>Feel the heat now.</i>

651
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,926
Hey.

652
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,359
Hey.

653
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,559
Excuse me.

654
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,000
You look kind of lost.

655
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,239
So, I'll have to keep him
busy at the table for what?

656
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,879
Ten minutes?
To be on the safe side?

657
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,119
What are you talking about?
You're not going.

658
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,799
You said he insisted
I come to dinner.

659
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,119
- It'll look suspicious if I don't show up.
- No, no, it won't.

660
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,159
She's right, Jack.

661
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,519
To him, something will be off.

662
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,719
You're not involving her in this.

663
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,999
You involved me in this
by not telling me.

664
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,199
You got to get her out of here.
Send her home.

665
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,959
Well, what are you gonna tell
Cherevin? That I'm homesick?

666
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,359
These are dangerous people,
Cathy. You cannot be here.

667
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,479
If you'd told me who you
really were, I wouldn't be.

668
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,841
I took an oath!

669
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,439
I took an oath.

670
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,239
I couldn't tell you
unless we were married.

671
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,239
- And you wouldn't marry me!
- That's why you wanted to marry me,

672
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,399
so that you could tell somebody

673
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,479
- that you were in the CIA?
- No, of course not.

674
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,759
You lied to me for three years
and you were good at it.

675
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,319
I think you actually enjoyed it.

676
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,399
Can we have a minute, please?

677
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,639
No, you can't.

678
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,239
I would like to talk to Jack alone.

679
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,966
This is geopolitics,
it's not couples therapy.

680
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,884
Do I really have to remind you
what's at stake here, Jack?

681
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,728
There's a very real scenario here
where we don't get out of this alive.

682
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,566
Any of us.

683
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,039
And neither do a lot of
innocent people back home.

684
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,210
Now, we had about eight
minutes to discuss this little...

685
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,161
This little development.
We just used four of them.

686
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,959
We don't need you to break
into Lemkov's computer,

687
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,519
just into the office next to his.

688
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:34,199
You plug this into any 220 outlet
that shares the same wall with him.

689
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,999
We use the building's own electrical
wiring to access Lemkov's hard drive.

690
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,799
How much time will he
need to run the program?

691
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,119
Five, six minutes,
including movement.

692
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,439
So the answer to
your question, yes.

693
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,722
10 minutes at the
table ought to do it.

694
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,559
All right.

695
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,880
You know, we catch a few
breaks, we can all be

696
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,199
headed home on a plane by midnight.

697
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,559
Cherevin will be at dinner in...

698
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,922
- Cathy.
- 55 minutes.

699
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,169
- Then I should get dressed.
- Cathy.

700
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,646
I like her.

701
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,442
If Cherevin touches
her, I'll kill him.

702
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,809
It's just dinner, Jack.

703
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,443
The most he can do is look.

704
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,043
And to be honest, we need him to.

705
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,891
- Good morning.
- Morning.

706
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,642
Do you know what happened
three years ago today?

707
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,643
You agreed to stop
wearing cargo shorts?

708
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:02,009
I did. I did, it broke my heart.

709
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,484
All that storage capacity.
Incredible. Incredible shorts.

710
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:09,879
No, but once I did agree to make
pants a part of the new me,

711
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,765
you finally agreed
to go out with me.

712
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,446
Well, I couldn't very well
date a patient, could I?

713
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,650
Could you marry one?

714
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,329
'Cause I'm in love
with you, Doctor.

715
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,605
Oh, my God.

716
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,444
I'd appreciate it if you would
wear the ring in public.

717
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,126
I left it in the hotel room.

718
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,686
I know.

719
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,926
I found it.

720
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,963
He's expecting to meet
my fiancee. And this is

721
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:12,040
his driver. So please
don't embarrass me.

722
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,239
Ah, the Ryans.

723
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,205
Perfect American couple. Welcome.

724
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:52,650
Viktor Cherevin,
my fiancée, Dr. Muller.

725
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,850
Dr. Muller, you are so beautiful.

726
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,085
Lemkov's headed out.

727
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,368
Jack, it's show time.

728
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,079
I hope you will enjoy the Haut-Brion.
It's a very special wine.

729
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,721
You find it amusing.

730
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,879
Jack had an early start.

731
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,161
So it seems.

732
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,241
Oh.

733
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,639
Hey. Can I get another
one of these?

734
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,491
This is good, Viktor. Ah.

735
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,803
Jack has a back injury.

736
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,520
From Afghanistan.

737
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,291
Me, too.

738
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,166
Different time, different
empire, same graveyard.

739
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,162
- My son's, also.
- Sorry to hear that.

740
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:03,159
Mujahideen grenade fragment is
lodged in my hip to this day.

741
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,439
I wouldn't think a hand grenade

742
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,719
would be the first thing you'd
wanna keep on your desk.

743
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,365
A reminder of a vanquished rival.

744
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,719
- You lost the war.
- But I beat your grenade.

745
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,839
My grenade?

746
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,008
One supplied by your CIA.

747
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,366
Perhaps.

748
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,001
Perhaps.

749
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,319
Well, I'm no medical doctor like
my illustrious fiancee here,

750
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,959
but I would recommend a
Percocet or three for that hip.

751
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,721
With a nice, hearty red like this, you
won't know your own name in an hour.

752
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,319
What? Come on, don't give
me that look, Cathy.

753
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:41,046
I'm not gonna be policed
at the dinner table.

754
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,651
Do you want one?

755
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,883
- I think not.
- Are you sure?

756
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,851
Oh, I'm sure.

757
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,639
You are so attractive like this.

758
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:53,839
Chin-chin.

759
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,451
Will you excuse me, please?

760
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,839
Jack, I speak no Russian.

761
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,679
Is it too much to
ask to be escorted?

762
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,199
Oh, it's just the bathroom,
Cathy. It's just the bathroom.

763
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,323
- Please. Allow me.
- Thank you.

764
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,239
<i>Nice work, Jack.</i>

765
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,246
I'm sorry.

766
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,521
Uh-huh.

767
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,800
I got it.

768
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,406
Okay.

769
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,001
<i>Exit.</i>

770
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,646
Snowball is rolling.

771
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,919
Okay to go.

772
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,360
<i>Step it up.</i>

773
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,806
Viktor!

774
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,559
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor. Tell me.

775
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,808
Which would you rather? Pick one.

776
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,887
Either you live in some miserable
shithole, you have no money,

777
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,726
but you're single.

778
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:02,399
Or you're rich, you live in
some fantastic apartment,

779
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:07,849
but you have to be, good God,
you have to be in a relationship.

780
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,324
Huh? What do you think?

781
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:16,286
- I'll leave the night to the two of you.
- I won't allow it.

782
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,041
I think one of us
needs to take a walk.

783
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,647
I think you should
consider her suggestion.

784
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,209
Please, sit down.

785
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,726
He's in.

786
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:01,408
You flew all the way to Moscow to surprise
him or to catch him, which was it?

787
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,410
That's a rather personal question.

788
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,559
Would you prefer impersonal?

789
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,331
I'd rather talk than make
chit-chat, wouldn't you?

790
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:13,039
If we're going to be married, I'd
like to know that I can trust him.

791
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,321
Trust.

792
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,127
Truth.

793
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,250
I think it's like most
opinions, best unexpressed.

794
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,369
You talk like Pechorin.

795
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,289
You've read <i>A Hero Of Our Time?</i>

796
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,239
I had a misspent sophomore year.

797
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,680
- Really?
- Mmm.

798
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,844
I love Lermontov. That
Russian romanticism is so

799
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,685
achingly desperate.

800
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:39,209
Desperate, yes. And insatiable.

801
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:31,439
It's about not aging
before your time.

802
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,079
You don't understand.
Aging isn't the problem.

803
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,439
Dying the proper way,
that is the problem.

804
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,159
Not if you've lived a
life without regret.

805
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,359
How on earth does one do that?

806
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,928
Regret. It piles up around
us like books we never read.

807
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,165
Well, that's the past.

808
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,079
Can you live the rest of
your life without regret?

809
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:55,011
Yes, perhaps. If I feel I have done
something truly great for my country.

810
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,320
Something my children would
have found important.

811
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,520
Would have?

812
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,645
You're incredibly beautiful.

813
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,839
I hope Jack Ryan realizes
how fortunate he is.

814
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,041
Mmm.

815
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,681
- Ready.
- Okay.

816
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,481
Go.

817
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,049
Okay.

818
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,879
Lemkov's on his way back.

819
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,519
Okay, you're on the clock.

820
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,210
Three minutes, 37.

821
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,879
Seal the elevators.

822
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,650
No one goes in or out.

823
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,641
Find Cherevin now!

824
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,683
How advanced is your cirrhosis?

825
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,651
You have a

826
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:31,486
yellow tinge to your skin tone.

827
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,647
Spider-web veins on the
backs of your hands.

828
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,803
You're stage three, aren't you?

829
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,239
You see? Now we're talking.

830
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,281
- Excuse me.
- No, please take the call.

831
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:54,439
They tell me I have less than three
months but you probably know that

832
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,961
because you are clearly
a brilliant doctor.

833
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:09,679
Jack.

834
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,759
<i>Hey, Teddy, it's Jack.
I'm in Cherevin's office</i>

835
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,959
<i>- and I need your help really quick...</i>
- I'm having dinner with her.

836
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:14,999
What?

837
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,770
Sarah in Arbitrage.

838
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,039
That's great. Look,
I need a favor, Teddy.

839
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:23,005
I'm at Cherevin. I'm having
a little trouble accessing

840
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,919
a group file code without a
partner-level ABA dodge.

841
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,399
Can you grab Rob for me?

842
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,959
<i>I know he's in a meeting right now.</i>

843
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,889
For you, the world.

844
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,639
Jack!

845
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,719
Hey, Rob.

846
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,519
You find anything juicy over there?

847
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:42,279
Oh, you know, accounts bullshit, hookers
and hotels, same old, same old.

848
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,289
Did Teddy tell you
I need that dodge?

849
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,722
I'll give it to you
on one condition.

850
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,039
Shoot.

851
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:52,450
If you get one whiff that FSB
is involved in whatever this is,

852
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:55,491
<i>you run, do not walk,
to the nearest airport.</i>

853
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,479
They play rough over there, Jack.

854
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,599
Under two, Jack. Step it up.

855
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,679
Understood. Yeah, understood, Rob.

856
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,159
<i>I worry about you, you know.</i>

857
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:06,240
Thanks. I appreciate it. Look, I'm a
little pressed for time on this end.

858
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,124
- Ready?
- Yeah. Shoot.

859
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,441
Four... One...

860
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,201
Seven.

861
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,719
<i>- You getting this?</i>
- Uh-huh.

862
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,207
<i>One... Eight...</i>

863
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,999
<i>Three...</i>

864
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,247
Six.

865
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:29,927
Jack?

866
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,566
We're in.

867
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,399
I'm not there yet. How we doing?

868
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,119
Okay, unless he ran the red lights.

869
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,479
Back on site.

870
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,364
He ran the red lights. Get out.

871
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:54,601
Got it! Got it!

872
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:07,602
Jack? You got trouble.

873
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,605
Oh, my God.

874
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:13,920
Oh, my God.

875
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,639
Main elevator is N.G.

876
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,410
<i>We're working on another exit.</i>

877
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,399
I need it now.

878
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,011
Yep, yep, yep.

879
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,205
There it is. Private elevator.

880
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:27,002
Back of Cherevin's office. Go.

881
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,799
<i>Hit the service entrance button.</i>

882
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:39,322
Texting you Cyrillic icon now.

883
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,999
There's an external staircase.

884
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,560
Harper.

885
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,959
Jack.

886
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,446
Jack.

887
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,164
Harper. Harper, can you hear me?

888
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,800
Damn it.

889
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,439
I'm flushed. Must be the wine.

890
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:13,839
Or perhaps the company.

891
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,119
- Are you about to misbehave?
- Would you like me to?

892
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,731
I haven't decided yet.

893
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:22,886
Telephone.

894
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,166
<i>Jack, stop.</i>

895
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,079
<i>Hurry up, Jack. He's got Cathy</i>

896
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,920
<i>and he's on his way
back to the building.</i>

897
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,359
<i>Duck.</i>

898
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,079
Keep moving, Jack.

899
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,487
<i>Staircase is clear
to the ground. Go.</i>

900
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,481
Control, you're on.

901
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,119
Cathy.

902
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,926
I'm so sorry.

903
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,599
Did you enjoy your walk, Dr. Ryan?

904
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,239
Mr. Cherevin, I have to apologize.
I had too much to drink.

905
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,559
Excuse me, Doctor!

906
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:14,841
- Yes?
- Yes?

907
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,167
<i>Viktor.</i>

908
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,930
Your wallet, let me see it.

909
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:21,241
What is this?

910
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,964
You missed a fascinating
conversation I had with Dr. Muller.

911
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,119
I did? What was that?

912
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,810
Things we regret.

913
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,641
Let's you and I have
that same talk soon.

914
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,890
You know, we should get home.
I am so sorry about tonight.

915
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:49,641
Have them followed.

916
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:57,199
Get us to Beta.

917
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,119
<i>Copy that.
Let's hit the safe house.</i>

918
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,360
<i>We clean the premises and
get the hell out of there.</i>

919
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:07,529
I have max-level data
coming in for analysis now.

920
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,842
We are tracking them.

921
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,287
The same old weaknesses, Viktor.

922
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:21,080
Vodka,

923
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,330
vanity,

924
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,005
women.

925
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:34,205
Your son would be ashamed.

926
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:39,646
Ryan has it.

927
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,199
The algorithm's
uploading to Langley.

928
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,279
Once we break it down...

929
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:25,606
It's tomorrow.

930
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,044
- What?
- The sell order.

931
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:32,399
It's programmed for 9:06 a.m. Eastern
Time. They're dumping everywhere.

932
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,719
Tokyo, London, Shanghai,
a dozen other exchanges.

933
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,880
It's almost two trillion.
It's gonna be a wipeout.

934
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,531
That's 18 hours.

935
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,199
How do we stop it?

936
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,559
They're not gonna flood the market
unless the terror attack is successful.

937
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,000
They'd lose everything.

938
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:50,604
And the attack will be coordinated
right before that, 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

939
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,446
Get down!

940
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,719
Go, go, go!

941
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,039
Albatross, we are compromised
at rendezvous Beta.

942
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,439
Request immediate backup.

943
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,331
No! Get off me!

944
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:24,599
Get off me!

945
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:25,919
Jack!

946
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,959
Cathy!

947
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,446
Jack!

948
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,201
Jack!

949
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:11,440
I don't know what you're saying.

950
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,159
Harper.

951
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,959
Harper, can you hear me?
Do you have her?

952
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,799
Are you sure she's wearing it?

953
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,999
Yes! Of course! I put
it on her myself!

954
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,919
We played the whole
scene for the driver.

955
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,406
Now where is she?

956
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,479
Got her.

957
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,799
It's working.

958
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,843
<i>Jack, send me a ping from yours.</i>

959
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:39,688
Southwest on Kashirskoye Shosse.
It's a kilometer from you.

960
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,890
Go! Go!

961
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,199
<i>Off the highway.</i>

962
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,399
Headed north toward Kuznetsky Most.

963
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,568
Third exit ahead of you, due north.

964
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,844
I hope you enjoyed your meal.

965
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,567
Cathy.

966
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,239
I hope for her sake you
have not yet transmitted

967
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:48,408
the information you stole from me.

968
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,924
I'm going to find you.
I'm going to find you.

969
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,439
How far?

970
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,768
Nine blocks behind him and closing.

971
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:01,764
We haven't started transmitting yet.
I still have the stick drive.

972
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,719
Very good, very good, Jack.

973
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:09,599
Let us hope Cathy and
I can believe you.

974
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,799
If not, I have always found
that in these situations

975
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:16,129
the swiftest results are achieved
by working with loved ones.

976
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,285
You know I have what you want.
Put her on the phone!

977
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,801
Doctor?

978
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:21,959
<i>Cathy!</i>

979
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:23,479
Talk to your fiancé.

980
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:25,170
Cathy, talk to me!

981
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,648
What? You think your...

982
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:32,567
Silence is in some way heroic?

983
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,479
Cathy!

984
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,728
We will do this other way.

985
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:45,322
So let me tell you something, Jack.

986
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:52,728
If you squeeze a neck just right,

987
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:56,159
human beings can't keep
their mouths closed.

988
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,319
<i>Jack.</i>

989
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:03,364
A light bulb will go into her mouth

990
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,999
because in <i>Lubyanka and
Lefortovo prisons,</i>

991
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,559
<i>we discovered in torture
that vacuum glass explosion</i>

992
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:14,890
inside mouth causes damage to...

993
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,044
Soft tissue, to enamel, to bone,

994
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:21,603
and to lungs, also.

995
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:25,291
It's quite a bit of,
what do you say,

996
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:30,291
havoc for forty watts, hmm?

997
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:31,919
Hard left coming up.

998
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,399
Just two blocks and you got him.

999
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,250
- Push it!
- I am!

1000
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,999
But when you look at this,
Cathy, you will know

1001
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,279
and, Jack, you will understand,
that I am very serious

1002
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:47,604
when I say that I want what you
stole from me and I want it now.

1003
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,891
Do you think Jack will get to you?

1004
01:19:56,680 --> 01:20:00,771
Or do you think he
thinks it is a game?

1005
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,239
<i>You think this is game, Jack?</i>

1006
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:16,049
<i>You think</i> my country bled for so many
years before your feet for game?

1007
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,239
Cathy!

1008
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,959
You think my son died for game?

1009
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,239
You think I will let
myself die for nothing?

1010
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:37,970
No, it is America that will soon
know what it is to have nothing.

1011
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,479
<i>He's got to cut back, Jack.</i>

1012
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:42,126
<i>You can catch him at the corner.
Run straight ahead.</i>

1013
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,439
I put bulb in her mouth, Jack!

1014
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:50,645
Now, I have my hand
beneath your bitch chin!

1015
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:53,799
<i>And now in moment,
I will crush her jaw</i>

1016
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:57,279
so she bites down on it and
begins slow and painful death!

1017
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,919
<i>So, I will say it once more,</i>

1018
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,851
I want what you stole from
me and I want it now!

1019
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:13,879
Cathy!

1020
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,491
Cathy!

1021
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,279
Come on! Let's go!

1022
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,999
- Let's go. You're all right.
- We need to go, now!

1023
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,119
Keep moving! We need to go!

1024
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,279
The attack is going
to happen, Ryan!

1025
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,959
You can't stop it.

1026
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:29,319
Jack, we need to get out of here.

1027
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:30,559
The police are coming!

1028
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,039
I got her! She's in!
She's in! She's in!

1029
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:34,163
Turn it on! Let's move! Let's move!

1030
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,159
Okay. Here's what we have.

1031
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:03,879
Aleksandr Borovsky,
AKA Andrew Bornstein, age 23.

1032
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:06,003
Last known address,
in Dearborn, Michigan.

1033
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,243
Move, move, move!

1034
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,519
- Let's go!
- Going in.

1035
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,529
Cover my six!

1036
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,159
The location's burned.

1037
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,399
They're up and out recently.

1038
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,519
They leave anything?

1039
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,199
Ashes and melted plastic.

1040
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,641
FBI was tipped that he
might be a sleeper agent.

1041
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,839
A sleeper agent who
was handpicked.

1042
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,239
This guy was groomed for it.

1043
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:27,726
This is personal.

1044
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,999
Wait a minute. Cherevin's son.

1045
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,079
What?

1046
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,079
Last night, Cherevin mentioned
something about his son

1047
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,919
having died. What if he didn't?

1048
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,159
Cross-referencing Moscow
hospital records,

1049
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:40,879
coroner's reports. Got it!

1050
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,879
Aleksandr Cherevin, age nine.

1051
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,759
Apparently died in a
drowning accident,

1052
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:47,919
June 2004. Cherevin's own
signature is on the certificate.

1053
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:51,239
Aleksandr Borovsky entered the
country in '04 with his parents.

1054
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:54,759
Aleksandr Cherevin, age nine, and
Aleksandr Borovsky, age nine.

1055
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,039
They're the same kid.

1056
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,719
He took a cash advance of $6,000.

1057
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,399
- And then he went black?
- Right.

1058
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,364
By now, he could be anywhere.

1059
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,799
Hey, Al. Where you been?

1060
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,079
You in some kind of shit?

1061
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,521
FBI was crawling all over here
yesterday looking for you.

1062
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,079
Wait. The guy knew that
the FBI made his phone.

1063
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,123
He would dump it, right?
He'd dump it.

1064
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:29,239
Michigan Bell. Is there a
listing near his house?

1065
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,283
Bear with me.

1066
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:32,559
Off-site delivery?

1067
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,159
<i>There's a way into him, I know it.</i>

1068
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,362
<i>- We just got to find it.</i>
- All right, drive safe.

1069
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:43,086
That fake death certificate,
pull it up again.

1070
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,641
Cherevin couldn't do this alone.

1071
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,519
That second signature right there.

1072
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,399
The attending physician,
Mikhail Yureyovich,

1073
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,079
emigrated to the U.S. in '08.

1074
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:53,119
Attained U.S. citizenship
two years later.

1075
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,368
Give me his Social Security number.

1076
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,839
377-31 -8622.

1077
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,799
Ah. Perfect. You have that?

1078
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,119
The doctor served with
Cherevin in Afghanistan.

1079
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:06,239
It looks like he's been subsidized
for years by Cherevin's firm.

1080
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:08,119
He's got at least four
offshore accounts.

1081
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,199
Found the pay phone!

1082
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,279
Uh-huh.

1083
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:11,719
- Six blocks away.
- Let me see.

1084
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,439
They ran it, but it didn't
cross with anything.

1085
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,639
All right. All right. Here, here.

1086
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,999
Someone called a pay
phone in Pennsylvania

1087
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,639
from the pay phone
nearest to his house.

1088
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:23,159
Pennsylvania... Pennsylvania...
Pennsylvania... Seventeen calls.

1089
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,839
That's it! That's it. That's it.

1090
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:28,839
We're searching for recent
nonresidential real estate transactions

1091
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,679
made by Yureyovich.

1092
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:32,399
Like a warehouse or
storage facility.

1093
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:36,159
Got it. Barn at 211 Swallowsdale Road
and same zip code as the pay phone.

1094
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:39,682
<i>Sold six months ago to Dr.
Mikhail Yureyovich. All cash.</i>

1095
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,725
He's in Pennsylvania.

1096
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,479
Nobody blows up Pennsylvania, Jack.

1097
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,569
Torn, he's in Pennsylvania.

1098
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,519
You're going to Pennsylvania.

1099
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,519
That's right. Get FBI to that barn.

1100
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,768
I need people there now. Thank you.

1101
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,599
We still don't know where the
attack's gonna come, Jack.

1102
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,719
If Borovsky's on the move, we need
to know where the hell he's going.

1103
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:25,639
Cell phone triangulation.
Where does this guy travel to?

1104
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:27,719
- Where has he gone?
- Michigan, Michigan.

1105
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,199
Michigan. He hasn't been anywhere.

1106
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,959
Bullshit! We're not
digging hard enough!

1107
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,162
Everybody goes somewhere.

1108
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,639
It's his parents.

1109
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:39,319
They're a unit, right?
They're a unit.

1110
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:42,439
If he didn't travel somewhere, maybe
they did. Where did they go?

1111
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:44,319
Did they post pictures online?

1112
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,639
No, no, no. They wouldn't do that.
They're too smart for that.

1113
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:48,279
We're looking for extended family.

1114
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,159
Look for extended family.

1115
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:54,279
Oh, did they hit anybody's Instagram,
Facebook, Hopscotch? Reddit?

1116
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:55,559
Nope, none.

1117
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,919
Here. Image Looker.

1118
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:59,239
An uncle in New York.
Borovsky's father

1119
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:03,199
accessed the account from his
phone four times, right here.

1120
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,482
Put it up on the main screen.
Get it up.

1121
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,289
They're going to hit Manhattan.

1122
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:11,045
Jesus.

1123
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,802
Our guy never went to New York.

1124
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,969
He had someone scout it for him.

1125
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:20,129
And they posted the pictures
so he could plan the attack.

1126
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,410
Wait, wait, stop.

1127
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,160
Back up.

1128
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,611
There, that.

1129
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:42,324
You know that building?

1130
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,485
- Jack works there. It's Wall Street.
- Oh, Jesus.

1131
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,282
An attack on downtown Manhattan.

1132
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:51,846
I'd say that'd start a panic.

1133
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,599
Get me Harper.

1134
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:01,839
Feds just uncovered evidence

1135
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:04,679
suggesting he camouflaged
a van stolen from work.

1136
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,008
Discarded tags, auto
paint, paint thinner.

1137
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:20,639
Tire tracks indicate
we're looking for

1138
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:23,719
a Ford Econoline, white or
blue body, long wheel base.

1139
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:26,559
Tell FBI we can be at the
site in ten minutes.

1140
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,439
Dr. Muller, there's a
car to take you home.

1141
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:29,479
An agent will stay with you.

1142
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:31,879
No. Take me to Lennox Hill
Hospital. They might need me.

1143
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,039
If I don't make it back...

1144
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,239
Look. I will see you tonight.
We're having dinner.

1145
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:37,679
And we're gonna split the check.

1146
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:40,839
Sir? Excuse me.
The chopper is ready.

1147
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,639
Have you been in one since?

1148
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:50,729
Don't worry about me.

1149
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:52,845
I haven't yet.

1150
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,199
Move! Bomb disposal going in!

1151
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,079
- Hold on!
- Get back, get back!

1152
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,799
The market has opened in
New York, Mr. Cherevin.

1153
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,719
Margin calls from creditors
are imminent. Do we sell?

1154
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:33,967
Not yet.

1155
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,931
<i>Please proceed as
directed by officers.</i>

1156
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,243
<i>I repeat, a total evacuation...</i>

1157
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,599
Jesus Christ.

1158
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,359
<i>Emergency vehicles only</i>

1159
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,369
<i>are allowed access
beyond this perimeter.</i>

1160
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:52,199
<i>Emergency vehicles only...</i>

1161
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:54,519
We got a dozen ESU trucks
coming in right now.

1162
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:56,599
I put the alert out to the
FBI and Counterterrorism

1163
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:59,559
to expand the EBU's search
to a 30-block radius.

1164
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:01,079
No, this isn't right.

1165
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:03,279
<i>I repeat, emergency vehicles only</i>

1166
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:06,324
<i>are allowed access
beyond this perimeter.</i>

1167
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:24,801
I want air traffic shut
down over the city.

1168
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,119
<i>Emergency vehicles only</i>

1169
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,159
<i>are allowed access
beyond this perimeter.</i>

1170
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:43,927
Harper!

1171
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,366
Harper!

1172
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:48,691
Harper!

1173
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:52,886
Teddy!

1174
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:55,159
- Teddy.
- Jack! I thought you were in Moscow.

1175
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,639
I was. I need the bike.

1176
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:57,887
Jack!

1177
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:02,279
We recommend immediate
execution of sell orders.

1178
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:03,481
Wait.

1179
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,399
Jack.

1180
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,999
- I got him!
- Jack, where are you?

1181
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,119
<i>It's a diversion!</i>

1182
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:19,319
<i>The painting in Cherevin's office,</i>

1183
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:21,839
<i>it's right out of Napoleon's
playbook. It's Waterloo!</i>

1184
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:24,839
He's not going to the building,
he's going under it!

1185
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,287
Jack?

1186
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:40,761
Jack!

1187
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,680
I need a cross-section of what's
underneath this building. I need it now.

1188
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,879
The greatest upward blast
amplification, where would it be?

1189
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:03,439
The convection chimney. Here.

1190
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,319
If the force of the blast
is channeled up through it,

1191
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,879
you're looking at shock over pressure,
six or seven buildings come down.

1192
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,720
Jesus. That's half of Wall Street.

1193
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:57,811
Let's get this thing up!

1194
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:00,479
Come on, clear the area!
We got to move!

1195
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:02,011
Open it.

1196
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:04,000
Secure the ropes. We're going down!

1197
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,845
Oh, God, no.

1198
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:44,847
Trading is about to be
suspended in New York.

1199
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:47,522
Mr. Cherevin, we need to act now.

1200
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:50,848
Please... Aleksandr.

1201
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:28,081
Where are you, Jack?
I've got people coming to you!

1202
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:37,441
We got nothing here, Harper!

1203
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:46,559
Jack.

1204
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:49,359
The sell-off's programmed for 9:06,
that's two minutes from now.

1205
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,719
Harper, we're not talking
about 10 or 15,000 people.

1206
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:53,081
More like 100,000.

1207
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:55,163
Just get me a clear
path to the water!

1208
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:57,124
<i>Head north on Front Street.</i>

1209
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:51,522
Sorokin wants to meet you now.

1210
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:13,051
It was always for Russia.

1211
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,166
So is this.

1212
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:27,169
You didn't pick this life. I did.

1213
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,285
But I picked you.

1214
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:39,120
I can't even kiss you.

1215
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:40,799
- Yeah, you can.
- That side?

1216
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,765
- It doesn't hurt that much.
- Really? You sure?

1217
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:02,328
Commander Harper? Dr. Ryan?
They're ready for you.

1218
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:06,242
Direct. Clear.

1219
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:10,639
Concise. If he doesn't ask,
he doesn't want to know.

1220
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:11,966
Yeah.

1221
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,160
Okay.

1222
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:19,567
Any way you can get that boy-scout-on-
a-field-trip look off your face?

1223
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,530
Not a chance.

1224
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,407
That's what I like about you.

1225
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:34,839
Harper, when do you ever sleep?

1226
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:36,530
You know what, don't answer that.

1227
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:39,883
I kind of like the idea that you don't.
Let me keep thinking it.

1228
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:44,244
And what's your name, son?
