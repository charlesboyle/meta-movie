Subtitle Enhaned by "Dr. Zia R Khan".
Enjoy the Movie.

1
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,509
- It's beautiful, right?
- It's great.

2
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,557
Hey.

3
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,435
- What's that?
- What?

4
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,268
- Check it out.
- Hey.

5
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,149
Okay.

6
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,151
- Hey, there's a note in it.
- Get out of here.

7
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,206
Yes, there is. It says:

8
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,992
- "Will you mar... "
- Stephanie?

9
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:21,382
It's no secret
we've been on a journey together.

10
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,125
An adventure.

11
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:27,930
And I've done a lot of soul searching
and I know...

12
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,549
This is just right.

13
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:36,347
So will you marry me?

14
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,978
That's so sweet. No.

15
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,314
Sorry?

16
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:44,192
I can't.

17
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,697
Really?

18
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,406
I really didn't wanna
do this right now

19
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,986
but you're kind of forcing my hand.

20
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,781
I'm thinking we've reached
the end of the line.

21
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,451
Really?

22
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,590
Look, Griffin, I know it shouldn't
bother me that you're a zookeeper...

23
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:04,007
But it kind of does.

24
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,960
And when we first started dating,
I just assumed...

25
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,677
That you would turn into the guy
that I'd always dreamed of being with.

26
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,591
- But...
- Not your dream guy, I got it.

27
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,101
You had to see this coming.

28
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,224
I bought a ring and rented a horse.

29
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:19,557
Well, that's not my fault!
Don't yell at me on the beach!

30
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,401
- I love...
- Stop it!

31
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,187
Do not make this harder
than it has to be. God!

32
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,399
You totally set me up.

33
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,783
Little heads up.
I may have hired a mariachi band.

34
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,499
Oh, there they are.

35
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,709
Just ignore them.

36
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,138
Ignore it.

37
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,490
Thank you, sir. There you go.

38
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,506
Good morning, Barry.

39
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,851
Come on, Donald, let's move you
out of the sun. Come on.

40
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,063
There you go, buddy. Nice and shady.

41
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,739
- Cherry.
- Thanks, Franky.

42
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,612
See you at the party tonight.

43
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,577
Come on, Shane. What are you doing?

44
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,162
We talked about this.

45
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:06,205
His food should always be fresh and
placed inside the door out of the sun.

46
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,341
You go down there all you want. I am
not getting jacked up by him again.

47
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,511
It's been 10 years. Bernie's cool.

48
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,180
Why do you bring
this stuff around here?

49
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,466
You trying to make the rest of us
look bad?

50
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,017
What? No, no.

51
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,929
I feel for him. He's all alone.

52
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,855
Oh, he's all alone.

53
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,767
Look, it all starts with trust.

54
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,273
Sure.

55
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,367
You won't be so cocky when
he's beating you

56
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:33,111
to death with your own arm.

57
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,921
Hey, bern.
Got a little something for you.

58
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,395
Looks like things
just got fun around here, huh?

59
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,850
What is this, anyway?

60
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,483
Is this an old tire
or a gateway to adventure?

61
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,233
It's... it's adventure.

62
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,365
It's an adventure.

63
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,165
Hey, Tony.

64
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,576
Go.

65
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,501
Hey. How did it go with
the tire swing?

66
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,425
Oh, that good, huh?

67
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,923
Don't know if he's gonna come around.
- Don't get discouraged.

68
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,010
Bernie feels what you're trying to do.
All the animals do.

69
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:42,058
- You're like the hippo whisperer.
- I don't know.

70
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,261
Hey, is that the new release cage?

71
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,561
Yep.

72
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,270
- The eagle enclosure's almost done.
- I gotta tell you, it is amazing.

73
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,150
- Great job.
- Thank you.

74
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,856
It's getting a lot of attention.

75
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,239
In fact, I may be sitting on an offer
to work my magic...

76
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,493
At the Nairobi zoo in Africa.

77
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,366
Oh, man.

78
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,414
Wow, that's awesome. Congratulations.

79
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,787
I'm thinking about it, but ....

80
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,624
It's great to be wanted.
You know how that feels.

81
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,171
Oh, I've been in play.

82
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,674
There was a zoo in New Hampshire
that was coming after me pretty hard.

83
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,336
It wasn't so much a zoo.
It was more an animal farm.

84
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,091
But the animals were nice. Cool.

85
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,348
Not big like here.
We didn't have the...

86
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,759
they had a couple badgers.
A badger and a...

87
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,516
they had a sick raccoon. Sick.

88
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,147
His name was Peter and he was big.

89
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,748
- Hang in there, girl.
- Whoa!

90
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:32,581
- You'll be all right.
- What happened?

91
00:06:32,582 --> 00:06:34,853
- She's having trouble breathing.
- What's happening?

92
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,988
She's stable and she's sedated.

93
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,657
- I'm gonna get a trach tube.
- Oh, my God. Okay.

94
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,570
- What do we do, Kate?
- Don't panic, Griffin.

95
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,455
- Not breathing.
- Support her neck.

96
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:49,835
On my count. One, two, and ....

97
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,288
She's a big girl. She's a big girl.

98
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,881
- Griffin, you okay?
- Yeah.

99
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,386
There's something blocking her airway.
I need a laryngoscope.

100
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,515
- I don't know what a laryngo...
- It's in the drawer.

101
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,386
Okay, I got post-its,
cinnamon tic tacs...

102
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,128
No, no, no. It's silver,
it's curved and has a light on it.

103
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:10,772
Got it.

104
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,525
Come on. There's definitely something
in her throat.

105
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,727
Hold her jaw open.
I'm putting my hand in.

106
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,441
- It's stuck.
- No, come on.

107
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,319
Oh, God. Okay.

108
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,115
- I guess I'm up.
- I can't...

109
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,696
- Come on.
- Okay, I'll hold.

110
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,658
- Hold the jaw.
- Come on, you can do it.

111
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,206
That's a feeling
I never wanna get used to.

112
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,788
Hurry, hurry.
You can do it, you can do it.

113
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,749
I got it.

114
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,834
She's breathing.

115
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,046
Good luck getting the deposit back
on that one.

116
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,923
You did it.

117
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,633
No, we did it.

118
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,181
We did it.

119
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,264
She's okay.

120
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,270
Oh, God. You're okay.

121
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,154
This place looks amazing, Griffin. No.

122
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,783
Grif, mom and dad
would have loved this. Thank you.

123
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,697
- Kate.
- Hi, Dave.

124
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,199
That's... Kate heads up
our eagle program.

125
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,784
- Congratulations.
- That's Robin.

126
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,920
- This is Venom, he's our reptile guy.
- Hey.

127
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,873
- How are you?
- Oh, you gotta bring it in with him.

128
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,424
Now onto the fiancée.

129
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,298
Okay, Venom, reel it in.

130
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,474
- Okay, that feels good.
- Yeah.

131
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,014
Hey, come on.
No, you're not married yet.

132
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,648
Congrats on your big day.

133
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,228
I don't know where you kids are going
for your honeymoon, but Omaha...

134
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,943
Stupid with underground fight clubs.

135
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,109
Okay.

136
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,036
- We're gonna circulate.
- Yeah.

137
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,367
All right. Congrats on being hot.

138
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,000
I gots to gets my flows on.

139
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,415
All right, folks.

140
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,372
I'd like to bring up the guy
who is responsible...

141
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:04,045
For putting together
this little party-slash-field trip.

142
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,554
Dave's brother, Griffin.

143
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,884
Griffin.

144
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,099
- Are you going with Floyd?
- Oh, yeah.

145
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,226
- Go get them.
- I'm getting them.

146
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,728
Let's hear it for him.

147
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,395
Love.

148
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,573
We're all here tonight
to celebrate one thing...

149
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,696
And that's love.

150
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,494
You know, finding the perfect mate...

151
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,740
Is the most important thing
in the world.

152
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,575
No matter what package they come in.

153
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,128
I mean, you take Floyd here.

154
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,415
Now, porcupines, they...
they get a bad rap, you know?

155
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:46,671
And I'm sure you see the sharp quills
and the tough exterior.

156
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,051
But you know what I see?

157
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,350
Just a great guy looking for love.

158
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,976
And that's what Robin sees
in my brother Dave.

159
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,228
- To the couple.
- Yeah.

160
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,528
To you guys.

161
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,026
Congratulations.

162
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,609
All right.

163
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,449
Hi.

164
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,247
God, what was I... ?

165
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,539
Sorry, I just lost my train of...

166
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,423
I got a train of... train.

167
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,426
What I'm basically saying is...
I mean, I'm not...

168
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,301
may not be an expert on love,
you know...

169
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,510
Per se.

170
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:35,052
But I do know a lot about animals.

171
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,230
He's an indigenous...
he's a woodland creature.

172
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,731
Did I cover burrowing?

173
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:44,269
Did I go over burrow
because I don't know if I got...

174
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,198
I had a whole thing on burrow.
Did it get hotter, 10 degrees hotter?

175
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,279
Where did that breeze go? It is hot.

176
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,739
My elbows are sweating.
That's weird.

177
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,697
I don't know why
I'm telling you this now. Oh, boy.

178
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:58,868
I had so many beautiful things...
I'm just gonna sum up.

179
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,333
I think sum it up,
what I wanted to say.

180
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:07,050
Dave, Robert, good luck.
That's really what it comes down to.

181
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:11,054
And anybody who wants to learn
more about porcupines...

182
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,590
I'll be off to the side over here.

183
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,974
Yeah. Food for thought,
ladies and gentlemen.

184
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,562
- You invited Stephanie?
- Sorry to jump you like that.

185
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:30,858
I didn't even know Robin
was gonna invite her. I'm an idiot.

186
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,986
You still got a thing for her,
don't you?

187
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:41,035
So, Stephanie, I saw the way
that you were looking at Griffin.

188
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,710
Is something going on?

189
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,588
I don't know.

190
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,209
I guess I feel bad about
the way things ended between us.

191
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,261
I might've been a little rough on him.
- A little?

192
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,218
Okay, Robin, a lot. I'll own it.

193
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:58,385
Seeing him tonight and
up there in his little uniform and....

194
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,928
So cute.

195
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:06,689
I don't know, it just reminds me
that he has so much potential.

196
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,446
You deserve a great girl in your life.

197
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,823
But you gotta understand
how the world works.

198
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,115
- What's wrong with being a zookeeper?
- Nothing, you're the best, okay?

199
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,494
It's just ....

200
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,076
Look.

201
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,333
Offer's still on the table
to work at the dealership.

202
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,995
Okay? Because here's you, the grass,
mine's greener.

203
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,796
- Dave.
- No, I'm serious.

204
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,840
You could make
your annual salary in a month.

205
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,636
That is how you get a girl
like Stephanie.

206
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,340
Come on, this could be
a whole new life for you.

207
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,810
Think about it.

208
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,228
Yeah.

209
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,641
Floyd, right?

210
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,227
I hope my being here
doesn't make you uncomfortable.

211
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:53,319
I'm not uncomfortable. So comfortable.

212
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,366
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

213
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,619
No, it's fine, it's fine. I got it.

214
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,654
Oh, God, it's barbed.

215
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,495
Okay, so, hey, how you doing?
Still in design school?

216
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,952
- No, no, I've been out for a while.
- Okay.

217
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,496
- I'm a buyer for Saks now.
- Oh, that's good.

218
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,040
I see you've been busy.
Lead zookeeper.

219
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,876
Yes, yeah.
You know, I got the bump last year.

220
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,511
They don't usually do that until you
have been working here like 10 years.

221
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,887
I'm only been here eight.

222
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:20,391
It's basically like getting a black
belt after only a month of karate.

223
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,848
Or mastering a ....

224
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,187
Let's see ....

225
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,395
That's all I can think of right now.

226
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,401
- Just karate, go with that.
- Yeah.

227
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,603
So it's good.

228
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,564
Yeah.

229
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,404
That's good.

230
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,743
Oh, Griffin, you're bleeding.

231
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,991
- No, no.
- Yes, yes, you are.

232
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,781
Come here.

233
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:46,417
Let me get it, come...
I'm not gonna bite.

234
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:48,874
There.

235
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,545
There you go. Now you're all better.

236
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,426
Anyway, Robin was talking about...

237
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:04,095
Wanting to see the animals tomorrow...

238
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,724
And were wondering what are the
odds of getting a private tour?

239
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,267
Not good. Not good at all.

240
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,028
There's a sign-up sheet,
a pretty elaborate waiver.

241
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,699
And you'd have to go
through the main office,

242
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,033
which is closed. They close at 4.

243
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,661
- Yeah, doesn't sound good.
- It's not.

244
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,613
Okay, so we're on our own.

245
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,368
- Well, it was really nice to see you.
- Okay.

246
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,001
You know?

247
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,333
Bye, Floyd.

248
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,256
Bye, Griffin.

249
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,511
Dave's right.

250
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,801
I gotta get out of this zoo.

251
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:50,185
- Closing up shop again, Grif?
- Yeah, just had to clean up.

252
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,895
Meeting.

253
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,026
Let's do this. Come on.

254
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,262
What? Oh, nothing.

255
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,098
I certainly wasn't cleaning
my basement.

256
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,776
Okay. Here we go.

257
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,787
If this is another eating
intervention, I'm not hearing it.

258
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,449
This is my ideal weight. Ask the vet.

259
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,954
Come on. Pop the latch.

260
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,869
Yeah, let's go. We want a good seat.

261
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,037
- What do you think this is about?
- What am I? Psychic?

262
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,340
We got the call at the same time.

263
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:58,458
Take it down a peg,
I was just asking question.

264
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,883
Bernie.

265
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,883
Hey, we having a meeting.
You wanna come?

266
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,968
No, you don't want to come.
Forget I don't know why I asked.

267
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,221
Come on, everybody. Let's go.
We're gonna have a meeting.

268
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,431
I'm excited about this.

269
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,766
- I wonder.
- What's going on?

270
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,444
All right. I got a very busy schedule.

271
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,855
This better be good.

272
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,865
You sleep 20 hours a day, Joe.
I think you'll live.

273
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,449
Okay, things I didn't want
the group to know.

274
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,995
Look, we got a problem.

275
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:30,660
Remember that chick that
broke Griffin's heart 5 years ago?

276
00:16:30,661 --> 00:16:32,076
Well, she is back.

277
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:35,002
- What?
- What, Stephanie's back?

278
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,708
This is not good.

279
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:39,750
Griffin's thinking of quitting
the zoo. We can't let that happen.

280
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,460
He can't leave.
He's the best zookeeper we ever had.

281
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,468
He keeps my hay fresh and he rubs
lotion on me when I get dry skin.

282
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:51,929
He makes papier-maché antelopes
for me to attack. And inside? Muffins.

283
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,356
Oh, I like muffins.
Can I get a "hey now"?

284
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,810
Plus, he's the only human
who recognizes me as an equal.

285
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,065
Yeah, in your dreams.

286
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,856
Thumbs, baby.
It's all about the thumbs.

287
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,112
- What do you call this?
- That's a paw.

288
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,368
You can't grab a coffee mug with that.

289
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,196
You can't wear mittens. It's useless.

290
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,656
I'm so blessed.

291
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,038
Sorry. One more look.

292
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,836
Griffin saved my life.

293
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,040
All right, you know what. I made my
decision. We're not helping Griffin.

294
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,238
Really? You know, because
I remember a time

295
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:24,048
when you needed some
help with females.

296
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,425
Namely me. Remember, you were shy.

297
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,932
You sent your buddy over
to test the waters to make sure.

298
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,310
And then you would, like,
follow me around.

299
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,891
I'd look at you,
you'd look away embarrassed.

300
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,601
Okay. We're helping Griffin.

301
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,314
- Now, how do you propose we do it?
- Animals are experts on mating.

302
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,751
We tell him point blank
how to get her back.

303
00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:43,320
No.

304
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,273
Nobody's talking to Griffin.

305
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:49,239
You know the code.
We don't ever talk to humans.

306
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,195
You don't break the code, idiot.

307
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,456
Besides,
Griffin's got no shot at this girl.

308
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,993
That is exactly why you're single,
Bruce. You have no sense of romance.

309
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,206
Herbivore.

310
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,415
Maybe it's possible to help Griffin
without talking to him.

311
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,671
The girl's gonna be here tomorrow
and she's interested.

312
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,252
And how do you know that?

313
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:11,391
She said, and I quote,
"Griffin has potential." Potential.

314
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,595
All we have to do is make him
look like a hero in front of her.

315
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,765
Then zip-zang, Griffin gets
the girl, stays at the zoo...

316
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,225
Everybody wins.

317
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,151
Awesome. We got a plan.

318
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,523
Hey, what's this now?

319
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,359
Wait. You're not a zoo animal.

320
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,900
Excuse me. Am I standing in the zoo?
Then I'm a zoo animal.

321
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:33,659
Don't get mad at us because no kid
says, "Mommy, I wanna see a crow."

322
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,957
Okay, that's the captivity talking.

323
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,331
Enough. You've all made your point,
we'll help Griffin.

324
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,121
But no one breaks the code.

325
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,332
- Understood?
- No breaking the code.

326
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,884
Okay, we're helping a human.
This is big.

327
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,711
Come on, Barry.
You started your diet today.

328
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,006
- He's not even chewing.
- Hey man! Take a breath.

329
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,142
What, I'm stress-eating.
Stop looking at me!

330
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:57,095
Much better than the tire we had.

331
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,605
Sorry about that, by the way.

332
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,687
You're gonna enjoy this a lot more.

333
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,944
I don't know. I made it, I drilled it
and I put a little ball in there.

334
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,776
Get that baby spinning,
have it land in a circle.

335
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,566
What? Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

336
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,368
I think you'll like it.

337
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,869
There. There you go.

338
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,622
I'm not sure, kind of like
a disco ball though. Look at that.

339
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,749
Party at Bernie's. It's fun.

340
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,501
It's gonna be good.

341
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:26,086
It sucks being alone here, buddy.
I know.

342
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,084
All right.

343
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,342
Okay.

344
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,466
See you tomorrow, Bern.

345
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,472
I don't know.
She just intimidates me, you know?

346
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,888
But you know me.
I don't like to talk about it.

347
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,689
Hey, Griffin.

348
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,483
- Hey, Grif.
- Hey.

349
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,482
We were gonna go see the rhinos...

350
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,488
And we were wondering
if you could show us the way.

351
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,033
You know what? I can't right now.

352
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,660
I'm feeding the giraffe.

353
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,071
She's eating carrots.

354
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,327
Okay.

355
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,755
Here they come.

356
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,341
- See the thumb?
- Yeah, yeah, I see it.

357
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,302
All right! Time to make Griffin
look like a hero.

358
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,843
Here we go. Get it together.

359
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,431
All right, here you go.

360
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,188
Anybody looking? No.

361
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,868
- Oh, my God.
- Joe.

362
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,243
Joe, over here.

363
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,114
Please. This way.

364
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,306
Get them out of there,
I'll distract him.

365
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,909
Got it.

366
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,745
Joe.

367
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,175
Oh, crap.

368
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,760
Get in.

369
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,269
Oh, God.

370
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,153
Joe.

371
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,980
Joe? Joe.

372
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,866
Joe.

373
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,036
Joe.

374
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,874
Joe.

375
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,254
Joe.

376
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,206
What the hell is wrong with you?

377
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,668
Oh, I mean:

378
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,056
Wait a sec.

379
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,931
Griffin, I know this is weird.

380
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,765
- Griffin.
- Lion secure, going home.

381
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:59,326
Haven 't you learned anything
from being under my tutelage?

382
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:16,761
No. No.

383
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:36,072
Mommy, look, it's going to eat.
Come on.

384
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:41,277
- Yeah, it's on but, like, on reverse.
- Yeah, you should definitely go.

385
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,827
He... ?

386
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,240
He didn't... ?
Wasn't saying anything, did he?

387
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,501
What's going on?

388
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,962
- He's a good one, yeah.
- How much do they weigh?

389
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,678
What's up?

390
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,268
- Good night, Griffin.
- Good night, Manny. Heading home?

391
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,771
If by "home"
you mean Uncle Bosoms...

392
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,523
I'll be there in the back,
purple couch.

393
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,021
Okay.

394
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,272
All right.

395
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:15,857
I know Barry, you had your dinner...

396
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,607
But this is just a little reward

397
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:21,868
for what I like to call
a winning attitude.

398
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,404
You care to comment on that?

399
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,243
Yeah, I didn't think so. Okay.

400
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,204
Have a good one.

401
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,626
You wanna talk? Let's talk.

402
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:54,734
You remember nothing.

403
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,439
I totally think this is working.

404
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,070
Relax. Calm down, calm down.

405
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,325
Breathe. Breathe.

406
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,244
Take it easy. Take it easy.

407
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,823
He's freaking out.
Look at him, look at him.

408
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,083
We're sitting in a circle staring at
him. What do you think I'm looking at?

409
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,411
- You can talk.
- Yeah, we can talk.

410
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,045
I can sing pretty good.

411
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,748
And I can teach you how to give
yourself a bath with your nose.

412
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:21,340
How'd you get out of your enclosures?
- You don't wanna know.

413
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:25,632
- Actually, I do.
- Okay, but I don't wanna tell you.

414
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,686
How long have you been able to talk?

415
00:24:27,687 --> 00:24:31,642
Let's see. Today's Tuesday, so always.

416
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:32,892
Always.

417
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,399
- Then why haven't you?
- Humans can't handle it.

418
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,901
Any time we talk to humans,
it always ends badly.

419
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,064
Except for parrots.
Somehow they get away with it.

420
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,732
"I be parrot.

421
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,992
Happy Birthday."

422
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,444
Why did you talk to me?

423
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,830
Look! You saved my mate so we tried
to help you connect with yours.

424
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,161
But you blew it.

425
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,038
I appreciate it, but you know what?

426
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,295
I had a really bad experience
and I don't like to talk about it.

427
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,296
"Don't like to talk about it."

428
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,425
That's crazy.

429
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,800
We've been hearing about
that breakup on the beach every day...

430
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,431
For the last five years.

431
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:11,139
Okay, I might have mentioned it before
I knew you could understand me.

432
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,521
Come on, man, we heard her talking.
She wants you.

433
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:19,319
So what if you don't have my great
complexion or my thick, wavy hair?

434
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:23,026
I would tell you this.
You have nice calves.

435
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,324
Great calves.
Of course I don't have calves.

436
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,826
I basically
have columns with toenails.

437
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,371
So.. I don't know, you think I should
maybe just ask her out?

438
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,537
Okay. All right, now,
slow it down, hot shot.

439
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:37,211
You ask Stephanie out,
it's gonna end the same way.

440
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,963
You haven't changed, you don't know
how to trust your instincts.

441
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:43,626
You listen to us
and we turn you into an Alpha male.

442
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,086
I don't know.

443
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,046
Personally, I don't think
he's got the size to be enough.

444
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,348
Size has nothing to do with it.

445
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:50,216
I think we both know who
the Alpha is between us.

446
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,518
You see right there.
You're giving me attitude.

447
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,387
That's why I do stuff
to your water bowl.

448
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,223
- That was you?
- Yeah.

449
00:25:55,224 --> 00:25:57,056
You said it was vitamin drops.

450
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,766
- Surprise.
- Oh, that's it.

451
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,102
- Bring it, come on.
- It's been brought.

452
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,653
Oh, boy, here we go again.

453
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:05,481
It's like watching a fight
between two beanbag chairs.

454
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,532
- I am tired. I'm back in.
- Me too.

455
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,740
You're a good man, Griffin.
You just need a little help.

456
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,997
Yeah. Who better than us to help you?

457
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,291
- Come on, you honeypot.
- Bring it, big boy.

458
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,621
What have I got to lose?

459
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,038
- That's not instilling confidence.
- Sorry.

460
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,374
Two more licks.

461
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,879
Is it on, is it on, is it on? Yeah.

462
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,148
Hey.

463
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,476
Thought we'd mix things up
a little today.

464
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:46,398
Got some organic jambalaya.

465
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,287
You know...

466
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,242
if you ever ....

467
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,951
You want anything, I...

468
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,579
you could always ask me.

469
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,039
Hey, how's the...?

470
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,129
How's that ball working out for you?

471
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,669
Lot of fun with the...

472
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,879
any disco...

473
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,841
Parties'?

474
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,894
All right.

475
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,777
Just leave it by the door.

476
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:40,667
Come on.

477
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:43,792
Move. Come on, stupid bears.

478
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,748
Do something.

479
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,003
What is he doing?

480
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,964
Hey. Don't do that.

481
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,387
No, no, no. Hey.

482
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,394
Can we get that?

483
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,779
Okay. Now, no sudden movements.

484
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:11,653
I want you to get to your feet. Okay,
we're gonna slowly walk to the door.

485
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,198
Come on.

486
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,283
They're not gonna hurt you. Good.

487
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,919
Okay, we're fine, here. Here we go.

488
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,872
- He backed you down.
- I didn't see you do anything.

489
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:32,969
Hey, thanks, guys.

490
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,218
I appreciate you showing
some restraint there.

491
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,303
Look, any other day,
that kid would've been lunch.

492
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:41,096
But you showed confidences, and that's
what you're not doing with the girl.

493
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,935
See, when I take down a female, I...

494
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,725
- Take down a female, you?
- You don't know me my whole life.

495
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,815
I did three years in Vancouver
for your information.

496
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,616
So, you said you got a
chick in Canada?

497
00:28:50,617 --> 00:28:52,023
Yeah, I was dating a kodiak model.

498
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,237
- Kodiak model?
- She's technically a model.

499
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,777
She was on a tobacco can,
she was born with an extra claw.

500
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,070
And let me tell you,
she knew how to use it.

501
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,160
Canadian bears are wild.

502
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:01,456
Very wild.

503
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:04,368
She's wild in your dreams.
You don't know squat, Jerome.

504
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,624
Were you there, huh?

505
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,164
I didn't think so.

506
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,374
And what's with the "Jerome"?

507
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,464
Anyway, you need to unlock
your inner bear.

508
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,218
The only way that's gonna happen
is to do as we say.

509
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,594
- And that's how you get your girl.
- We get it.

510
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,304
All right, let's start with your walk.

511
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,888
- My... come on, my walk is fine.
- Fine? It's a hot, stinking pile.

512
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,848
This time he's got a point. Come on.

513
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:28,104
- Show us your stuff.
- Yup.

514
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,519
My... this is stupid.

515
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:32,029
- My walk?
- Wipe that goofy look off your face.

516
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,780
You're a predator. Act like it.

517
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,317
Get those paws up. That's what we do.

518
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,281
What was that?

519
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,411
- No, no, no.
- This guy's untrainable.

520
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,787
I really think we're wasting
our time here.

521
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,245
Give me one more shot.
Come on, get your paw up.

522
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,122
Yeah, up. Come on, reach.

523
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,538
- This is ridiculous.
- We know what we're doing.

524
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,047
- Trust it.
- Get your paws up.

525
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,378
There you go.
That's what we're talking about.

526
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,633
Let's see some movement.

527
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,087
Swing your paws
like you're swatting salmon.

528
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,755
- Good.
- I don't know, man.

529
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,965
Give us a snort. Good old bear snort.

530
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,977
Not with your nose, with your mouth.
Get your lips into it.

531
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,931
- There you go.
- Yeah.

532
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,767
- Now lead with your pudding cup.
- My pudding cup?

533
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:13,403
Yeah, your pudding cup, man.
Get it out front. Remove the mystery.

534
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,943
That's good like that.

535
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,025
Who... '? How would this ever help me?

536
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,861
- Yeah! Show them the goods.
- This just feels weird.

537
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:23,076
That's it, looks good. Come on.

538
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,740
Add a roar.

539
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,284
The roar.

540
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,704
Put some oomph into it.

541
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:30,958
Roar.

542
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,464
- Fine.
- Bend those knees.

543
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,756
- Get low.
- Yeah.

544
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,543
- Shake that money-maker.
- Swing those arms.

545
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,303
- Here's a predator.
- Dig a hole.

546
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,430
- Dig a big old bear hole.
- Dig it.

547
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,011
- Get dirty.
- Stop digging.

548
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,017
- No, keep digging.
- Keep digging.

549
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,265
- What, are you too good to dig?
- That's it.

550
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,101
- Through the wickets.
- That's good.

551
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,933
Kick up those woodchips.
Look at him, a natural.

552
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,147
Scratch your back.
Scratch it on the tree.

553
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,733
- Yeah, he's a bear.
- Yeah, he's a bear, baby.

554
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:58,524
- You're the bear.
- You're a big bear.

555
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,362
Stop it.

556
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,751
Hi, kids.

557
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,584
Carry them all?

558
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:16,383
We'll look at the giraffe now.

559
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,095
I appreciate the grub.

560
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:28,558
No problem.
I popped it myself, so enjoy.

561
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,849
Now, I would have left it in longer.
I like mine burnt a bit.

562
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,393
But I wasn't sure
how you weighed in on that.

563
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,104
This is fine.

564
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,490
Hey, Shane.

565
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:45,829
I was supposed to tell you there's
a staff meeting tomorrow at 10.

566
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,498
Okay, cool. Thanks.

567
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,497
Who are you talking to?

568
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,708
No, you know what it is?

569
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,373
I'm in a one-act play...

570
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,837
And I was rehearsing.

571
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,466
I know both parts because
I'm understudying the other guy.

572
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,050
And something.

573
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,638
What's the play about?

574
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,390
Steam ships.

575
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,853
I wouldn't do it around him.

576
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,735
That's when they get you, you see?

577
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,113
When you're not focused.

578
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,953
I didn't do it, you know.

579
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:30,244
- I'm sorry?
- I didn't attack him.

580
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,414
Oh, yeah, he says you did though.

581
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,541
He's a liar, okay?

582
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,669
He never treats us with any respect.

583
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:41,335
To get us to move,
he prods us with a long stick...

584
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,048
With a nail in the end of it.

585
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,636
One day, I guess I wasn't
walking fast as he wanted me to...

586
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:51,679
So he swung the stick at me, but I
caught it, and he slipped and fell.

587
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:55,600
He told everyone I attacked him.

588
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:00,062
Wow, I never knew any of that.

589
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:06,073
And my only mistake was
assuming he would tell the truth.

590
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,408
I guess that's what humans do.

591
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,578
They lie.

592
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,585
Not all humans, Bernie.

593
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,773
Look, now, maybe you got a raw deal...

594
00:33:17,774 --> 00:33:21,254
But sometimes we need
to put the past behind us...

595
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,761
And look towards the future, you know?

596
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:31,393
I guess sometimes
we all get stuck living in the past.

597
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:34,934
Yeah.

598
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,315
Look, is there anything else
I can do for you?

599
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,314
Can you get me my view back?

600
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:44,031
You know, it's not my call.

601
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:47,735
I miss it, you know? Seeing the world.

602
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,279
I used to be able
to climb high enough...

603
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:53,787
That I could just catch a glimpse
of a few buildings.

604
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,957
Now all I see is cement.

605
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,874
I wish I could help you, Bernie,
but... I mean, that enclosure's gone.

606
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,132
It's a...

607
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,134
It's where the snack bar is now.

608
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,926
All right.

609
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,926
Do you mind if I ask you a question?

610
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,180
Anything.

611
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:17,765
Is T.G.I. Friday's
as incredible as it looks?

612
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,725
It's pretty good.

613
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:22,777
All right! Your girl's gonna be at
the party. Here's how we get her.

614
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:27,237
First, answer me this, what do you
think attracts a female to a male?

615
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,821
Looks, success...

616
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,572
I'm gonna stop you right there.

617
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,829
- It's pee-pee.
- Sorry?

618
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:38,085
Pee-pee. Smell, scent,
chemistry, pheromones.

619
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,962
Which is why you have to learn
to protect your territory.

620
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,291
- Turn everything into a home game.
- There's gotta be another way.

621
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,173
There's not.
Now, don't be stingy with the magic.

622
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,087
Watch and learn.

623
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,759
Notice the full extension
of my lift leg.

624
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:57,805
- The proud, soaring arc of my stream.
- Yeah.

625
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,311
You see how I raised the bar
from the last pee mark.

626
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,942
And <i>voilé.</i>

627
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,269
You're up, sunshine.

628
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,321
You know,
I really don't feel like doing this.

629
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,450
The zoo is closed. You're fine.

630
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,573
All right.

631
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,075
Not there. That's my spot.

632
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,078
Hey, don't give me attitude.

633
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,209
This will help you
at the rehearsal dinner tonight.

634
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,870
Right here. Fine.

635
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,711
All right, unzip and make it rain.

636
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,592
Okay, you gotta look away.

637
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,511
Such a delicate flower.

638
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,808
Shut it down. Shut it down.

639
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,347
- Kate's coming.
- What?

640
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,890
- I can't_
- Snap it.

641
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,270
Be a man. Snap it.

642
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,654
Hey Griffin, Rebecca and I are going..
- Hey.

643
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,239
Hey.

644
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,025
It's gonna be very hard to unsee that.

645
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,821
I'm sorry about that, I...
you know what happened...

646
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,490
the wolf got stung
by one of Venom's scorpions.

647
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:01,251
And I was taking him
to the infirmary...

648
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:06,673
And then he started limping bad.

649
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,927
Oh, and the urine
will neutralize the poison.

650
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:15,136
Exactly, exactly, yes, yes.
And that's why I did it.

651
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:19,186
I was just peeing on him,
for his health.

652
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:23,607
Okay, when you finish, I'll give him
an antihistamine just to be safe.

653
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,684
- Sounds good.
- All right, go ahead.

654
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,650
Go ahead. Soak it.

655
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,818
Make sure you get the whole area.

656
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,031
Sorry.

657
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,705
I have to.

658
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,794
Lather, rinse, repeat.

659
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,340
Excuse me, sir.

660
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,764
You do know that we have
a fully functioning

661
00:36:55,765 --> 00:36:57,391
restroom not 20 feet from here.

662
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:00,598
Oh, look at that... you do, good,
that sounds good. Yeah, that's nice.

663
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,387
- Have a good evening.
- You too.

664
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,689
- Hey, how's it going?
- Good.

665
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:08,193
I've set up my territory, I'm about
to show Stephanie my pudding cup.

666
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,398
What?

667
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,191
- Yeah, thank you.
- Pretty great party, huh?

668
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,117
Yeah, Dave goes all out.

669
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,660
He really does.

670
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:21,540
Listen, Stephanie, I was thinking...

671
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:24,451
Weddings can be weird
if you're alone and you...

672
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,831
Oh, God.

673
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,539
No, no, don't. No, it's not you.

674
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:30,753
It's, it's...

675
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:34,636
Oh, it's my ex, I broke up with him,
but he showed up here anyway.

676
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:37,009
Sweetness. Funny story.

677
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,971
So I go to the fridge the other day
to replenish the old electrolytes...

678
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,761
after some cross-training,
and there...

679
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,397
Taped to the door, right next to the
picture of that kayak I'm getting...

680
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:50,774
Was the invitation to this wedding
that you wanted me to go to.

681
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,279
So here I be.

682
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:58,572
No, no, no.
Gale, this is an old friend of mine.

683
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,909
Griffin.
Actually, my ex-boyfriend, Griffin.

684
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,324
Griffin, this is my ex-boyfriend,
Gale.

685
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,001
What's up?

686
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,419
Everything.

687
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,415
So listen.

688
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:16,257
I know we had some stuff,
but I'm making changes.

689
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:20,136
Okay, I sat down with my life coach
and I cleared out everything...

690
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,092
Except for you.

691
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,308
So suddenly I'm more important
than learning the banjo?

692
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:32,276
Griffin, you wanted to
ask me something. Remember?

693
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,154
- It's very nice meeting you.
- That's what people tell me.

694
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:42,157
What was I supposed to do?
Her ex-boyfriend showed up.

695
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,885
Nothing, there's nothing you could do.
Fleeing was the right call.

696
00:38:44,886 --> 00:38:45,995
In fact, fleeing is the new fighting.

697
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,500
I know we flee...

698
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,162
But humans are supposed to be
at the top of the food chain...

699
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,705
So I think we should just ask Joe.

700
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:54,837
Joe!! Why are you so concerned
with what the stupid lion would do?

701
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:59,171
Do you realize that if monkeys'
canine teeth were a little bigger...

702
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,598
We'd hold the title,
king of the jungle?

703
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:05,135
Let me ask you something,
can the king of the jungle do this?

704
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,640
He's behind me. I saw him mid-flip.

705
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,232
Cut her from the herd.

706
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:15,066
Cut her from the herd.
That's a good call, Joe.

707
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:18,653
As long as this other guy's in
the picture, you ain't got a chance.

708
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,076
Next time you see her, get her alone.

709
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,324
That's how you'll get your girl.

710
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,363
♪ That's how you gonna get your girl

711
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,532
♪ That's how you gonna get your girl
yeah, yeah

712
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:31,203
♪ That's how you get a girl
That's how you get a, get a girl

713
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:34,794
Just focus on the lyrics.

714
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:38,377
You know what? It's worth
a shot, I'll try it tomorrow.

715
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,796
I basically had
the same advice Joe did...

716
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,964
But he kind of stole my thunder.

717
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,509
- You coming, Barry?
- Okay, you're not listening.

718
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:48,724
I gotta be honest, guys,
my legs fell asleep when we sat down.

719
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,389
I think I'm here overnight.

720
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,359
Hey. Hey, look, my bus was late.

721
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,023
I need a bike.

722
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,609
Sorry, but that big wedding party
just cleaned me out.

723
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:06,287
Yeah, that's my group.
Please, you got to have something.

724
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,883
That's right.

725
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,352
Cut her from the herd.

726
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,262
How weak.

727
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,977
Hey, Stephanie.

728
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,435
- That's how you're playing it?
- Stay away from her.

729
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:39,604
- Share the road.
- I'm not good at sharing.

730
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,119
This is not right.

731
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,658
Stop it, this is...
very dangerous out here.

732
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,585
- Oh, my gosh.
- Get off the road!

733
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:25,571
Move it. Coming through.

734
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,084
- Taste the heel.
- Hey, easy.

735
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,331
- Taste it.
- Stop it.

736
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,496
I will not get the deposit back
if you do that.

737
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,759
Oh, sweet nanny, that is painful.

738
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:47,968
Oh, Jesus. That is fiberglas. Stop it.

739
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:49,303
Oh, Jesus.

740
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,438
- Hey.
- Oh, Grif.

741
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,487
You're like a daredevil.

742
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:11,113
So listen, I've been thinking...

743
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,577
I was thinking about...
hold on a second.

744
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,040
Everything just turned light blue.
My body's starting to shut down.

745
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:22,170
- Oh no! Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

746
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,459
- Okay, I'm good.
- Okay.

747
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,294
I was thinking about the wedding.

748
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:29,806
I was wondering if maybe you needed
someone to go with you, that I...

749
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:32,350
Oh, look, Griffin,
I need to tell you something.

750
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,218
Yeah?

751
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:38,102
I'm gonna go to the wedding with Gale.

752
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:41,143
He was supposed to come with me
before we broke up...

753
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:45,689
And we had this long talk
and I'm really confused right now.

754
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,357
I hope you understand.

755
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,365
And I hope you understand that, that
is fantastic. It's better this way.

756
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:58,285
- Really?
- Yes, yeah. Yes, yeah.

757
00:42:58,493 --> 00:42:59,540
- Okay.
- All right.

758
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,921
All right. Bye.

759
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:08,507
Get ready to experience
the hail of Gale.

760
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,717
Cherokee style.

761
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,319
You said to cut her from the herd,
I did.

762
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:27,572
You see this is what happens. I
should've never listened to you guys.

763
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,903
We didn't tell you to back down.

764
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,318
You'd better stick to your
cozy life...

765
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:35,705
Because take it from me,
you would never make it in the wild.

766
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,664
What did you just say?

767
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:39,984
I'm saying in the wild,
I would never let a

768
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:42,045
rival dictate the
outcome of a situation.

769
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:45,465
"In the wild"?
You were born in captivity, Joe.

770
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,547
In this very zoo. I bottle-fed you.

771
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,804
"In the wild." You've never been
in the wild a day in your life.

772
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,473
I could walk 25 yards
and buy a balloon on a stick.

773
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,384
- "Wild."
- You're missing the point.

774
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:59,395
Whether you're taking out a rival
or taking down prey...

775
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:02,899
It's not just the attack, it's about
everything leading up to it.

776
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:04,146
Okay, if I'm not mistaken...

777
00:44:04,147 --> 00:44:05,978
The females in the pride,
they do the hunting.

778
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,028
- We do.
- Thank you.

779
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,231
And the fighting.

780
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,862
Okay, you know what?
Are you giving the advice?

781
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:17,493
If you are, I don't need to be here.
Yeah, you heard me, I will walk.

782
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:18,823
Relax, Joe.

783
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,163
The best way for a male
to attract a female...

784
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,123
Is to be seen with another female.

785
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,500
If he's going to the wedding,
he needs a date.

786
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,461
That's it. Good night.

787
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:30,760
Find a date, sweetie.

788
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,221
I'll do that.

789
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,268
So basically you're using me.

790
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,685
Not basically, I am.

791
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,185
This is very junior high,
you do realize that.

792
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,600
It is, I admit it, I am not proud.

793
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,902
I don't think you should have to
go through all this to get her back.

794
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,062
- No, I do, I definitely do.
- I don't know.

795
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,157
Yeah, you always said ,
you can't remember

796
00:44:51,158 --> 00:44:52,277
the last time we went on a date.

797
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,783
This isn't a real date.

798
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:57,241
If I'm gonna go on a fake date,
I was hoping I'd fake date a doctor.

799
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,076
Or somebody French.

800
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,907
Please.

801
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,964
If you do this for me, I will...

802
00:45:03,965 --> 00:45:06,459
give you half my lunch for the
next three years.

803
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,460
You know what?

804
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,091
And this, to sweeten it.

805
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,461
That's a signing bonus, if you do.
Take it, look at that.

806
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:14,716
All right, I'll go.

807
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:19,510
But I'm calling you Francois Dubois,
cardiologist.

808
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,470
You can call me Betty,
as long as you're going.

809
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:32,234
Hey, buddy.

810
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,535
Got a little something for you.

811
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,204
Happy birthday...

812
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:44,952
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

813
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:48,038
It's out. It's out. I'm sorry.

814
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,415
I was just messing with you.

815
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:52,796
Oh, my God.

816
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:55,007
Yeah, I mean, don't do that to me.

817
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,672
It's a gelatine cake.
Kate made it for you.

818
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,804
- She's a good lady.
- Oh, my heart's racing, man.

819
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,851
Was that on a plate?

820
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:14,898
- No, you're good.
- Thank Kate for me.

821
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,402
That's it? You're all birthday-ed out?

822
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,738
I'm sure you got things to do.

823
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:25,496
Actually, we do.

824
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,461
How are we gonna pull this off?

825
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:36,386
- I don't exactly blend in.
- It's simple.

826
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,338
Once we get out, we just tell people
we're going to a costume party.

827
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,266
- No one's gonna believe that.
- Maybe not at first.

828
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:47,602
But when you put on this shirt
and talk, they will.

829
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:53,687
Griffin, I'd hug you, but it's
fifty-fifty I'd crush your spine.

830
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:56,773
You know what? Fist bump works.

831
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,112
- My wrist.
- Oh, man, I'm sorry.

832
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:02,196
Payback, baby. Come on.

833
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,872
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

834
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,084
- Can I drive?
- No, you cannot.

835
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:13,380
Please?

836
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,336
Sorry, Bern, not happening.

837
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,735
Look at that up there.

838
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:45,158
I'm so alive.

839
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,307
Take it easy, man. No problem.

840
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:10,889
Here it comes, you ready?

841
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:33,412
Shut up.

842
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:46,432
Hi, y'all, welcome to Friday's.
Can I interest you in... ?

843
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:50,516
Yeah, we were just at a costume party.

844
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,939
- Zookeeper.
- Gorilla.

845
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,691
Preppy gorilla.

846
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,395
And then we noticed there was already
a gorilla so we were like:

847
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:04,450
<i>You know what? Let's put wings on this
loser train and get our Friday's on.</i>

848
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,910
- You look so freaking real.
- He does, yeah.

849
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:11,661
Can I try on your head?

850
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:13,493
Yeah, no, l... you know...

851
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:16,295
It's all hooked on
with wires and what-not.

852
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:19,749
And stink. This thing hasn't
been washed in years.

853
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:23,257
I think the last guy who wore it
might have thrown up.

854
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:24,508
Yeah.

855
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:25,884
Can I get your order?

856
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:29,300
I'm just gonna go with the baby backs
and some fries.

857
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:30,514
And for you?

858
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,558
Thirty oranges.

859
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,774
No, Bernie, that's ice.
Buddy, that's cold.

860
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,113
Should've warned you. Oh my God.

861
00:49:47,114 --> 00:49:48,615
It's called a brain freeze
right there.

862
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:53,036
Gonna get worse before it gets better.
Ride it. Ride it.

863
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,950
Gonna subside in about 10 seconds.

864
00:49:54,951 --> 00:49:57,040
Yeah, that's ice, but it's deadly.
Deadly.

865
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,597
We'd like to send that table of

866
00:50:07,598 --> 00:50:10,091
secretaries a basket
of zucchini fries.

867
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,429
You got it.

868
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,107
Yeah.

869
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,243
My eyes.

870
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,543
Yeah.

871
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:57,100
I'm so glad I met you.

872
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:14,280
Penny for your thoughts?

873
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:17,700
Just hanging out,
enjoying your company.

874
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:21,504
So there's talk
you might leave the zoo.

875
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:27,051
I was just upset. Thought that's what
I needed to do to get Stephanie back.

876
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:30,095
No, Bernie,
I'm afraid you're stuck with me.

877
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:32,139
I wanna thank you.

878
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:36,269
Tonight you gave me
more than I could ever ask for.

879
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,721
You're very welcome, Bernie.

880
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,768
You're a good friend.

881
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:45,152
Hell, you're my best friend.

882
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:52,276
I just made this weird, didn't I?

883
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,120
No, no, not at all.

884
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:57,164
Okay, good.

885
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,327
Can I try on your watch?

886
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,120
Now it's getting weird.

887
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:14,515
What are you doing out of
your enclosure? Someone can see you.

888
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,347
- No, no one's around.
- We were worried about you.

889
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,179
Tell me you're not wearing that
to the wedding.

890
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:22,095
No, no, no.
I got an outfit all picked out.

891
00:52:22,096 --> 00:52:23,350
All set with the other female?

892
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:25,563
Got it covered, Kate's coming with me.

893
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:27,395
- Oh, good choice.
- Thanks.

894
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:30,698
- Joe, anything else for Griffin?
- What would I know?

895
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:34,281
- You're the expert on everything.
- God, your mother ruined you.

896
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:36,821
She did not. Your mother ruined you.

897
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:40,082
Has anyone got a game plan
for the ex-boyfriend?

898
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,659
We forgot about him.

899
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,416
Look. I couldn't help overhearing.

900
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,422
You wanna intimidate a rival?
You gotta do this.

901
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,587
And if that doesn't work,
assume attack position.

902
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:55,757
Okay, if I was in a pond
that would be my go-to move.

903
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,592
- I respect that.
- Maybe you better take me with you.

904
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:01,020
- Bernardo.
- Oh, my God, it's Bernie.

905
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,430
Hey, that's great.

906
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,974
- Bernie, you made it.
- All right, all right.

907
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,438
Let's not make a big deal out of this.

908
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:09,020
Here's what I'm thinking.

909
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:12,736
Take me along, you know,
just in case you need some backup.

910
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,319
- Bern, I gotta do this on my own.
- I'll sit at another table.

911
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:22,117
You won't even know I'm there.
I've got unbelievable mingling skills.

912
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,660
Bernie, you're a gorilla.

913
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:30,507
I can't believe you just went there.

914
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,009
All right, fine.

915
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,304
But if you get in a jam, call us.

916
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:38,508
- Will do, all right?
- We're gonna need your cell phone.

917
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:40,802
- What?
- Hand it over.

918
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,267
Fine. Here you go.
Thanks. Thanks, guys.

919
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:48,066
All right, everybody back to
your enclosures before the zoo opens.

920
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:53,113
- Where did you get the watch?
- Don't you worry about it.

921
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:56,817
Venom?

922
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,572
I got you. I've got you covered.

923
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,864
Sure this is gonna help
with the ladies?

924
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:04,499
Hey, Venom,
I need to ask you a favor...

925
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,289
Franky.

926
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:11,416
- Venom, I need to borrow your car.
- Absolutely.

927
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:17,509
- Gonna need your keys.
- Oh, yeah, they're in my pocket.

928
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:21,013
Oh, I had a little dust-up
with the copperhead.

929
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:24,429
Yeah, I won't be able to move the arm
for another six hours.

930
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,139
Go get yourself some keys, brother.

931
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:38,404
Other pocket.

932
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:45,119
Thanks.

933
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:21,819
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

934
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,779
You look amazing.

935
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:25,910
- Thank you.
- No.

936
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:29,202
No, you overdid it. Don't you see?

937
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,955
You look too good for me.
People are gonna know it's a setup.

938
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:36,216
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

939
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:39,010
What did you want me to do?
Come in my work clothes?

940
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,883
No, no, we don't have time now.
Thank you.

941
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,147
Yeah, you would know.

942
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,182
Here, come here.

943
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:58,447
She didn't notice us at the church,
now she's gone. She's just gone.

944
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:00,316
So, we tussle a little bit ....

945
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:01,571
There she is.

946
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:05,829
Then the sea lion lets me go.
Thirty seconds later, I resurface.

947
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:09,379
And he's killing over there.
It's not happening.

948
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,501
So, what's the game plan here?

949
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:13,412
'Cause this whole clinically depressed
energy is not getting the job done.

950
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,464
- I can't compete with him, all right?
- I don't care.

951
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:21,800
And to this day, you can't say
my name around Jose Canseco.

952
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,260
I know.

953
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,763
Give me your hand.

954
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:29,390
What?

955
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:31,972
Come on.

956
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,526
She's looking.

957
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,987
- You positive she saw us?
- Yes.

958
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:49,035
- She just looked over here.
- Laugh.

959
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:52,664
- What?
- Laugh like we're really having fun.

960
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:04,092
Okay, take it down.

961
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,801
- I'm gonna throw up.
- No, no, no, it's okay.

962
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:12,642
Just keep... don't look...
turn away...

963
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:16,567
- Oh, God, I just sucked in a fuzz.
- Are you okay?

964
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:21,105
Okay, everybody,
I know tonight isn't about me...

965
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:24,275
But my beautiful girlfriend,
Stephanie and I...

966
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,069
recently won
a ballroom dancing competition.

967
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,996
I hardly had any lessons,
but I'm wicked athletic...

968
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,532
And like I said, we won.

969
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,663
Now, tonight in honor of
the bride and groom,

970
00:57:33,664 --> 00:57:35,586
we'd like to perform our
winning dance.

971
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:37,625
Get up.

972
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,928
Oh my God! This is our song.
This is my song with Stephanie.

973
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,220
No, it couldn't be.

974
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:52,223
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

975
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:53,854
No. No.

976
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:57,312
Okay, this is definitely the song,
then.

977
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,943
Maybe it's a coincidence.
It's a very popular song.

978
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:01,775
Maybe it means she is really
thinking about you.

979
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,405
I'll wait.

980
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:13,575
I don't believe this.
This is a clear statement.

981
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:17,252
It's premeditated, very definitive.
She knew exactly what she was doing.

982
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:19,709
This is definitely on purpose.
We are...

983
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:20,960
Okay, okay.

984
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,888
Can you do any of that?

985
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,344
No.

986
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,387
Okay, you're gonna do it.
We're gonna do it.

987
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:37,147
We're gonna do it.
Oh, man, they're good.

988
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,608
He's lifting her.

989
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:44,567
How did they...? Wait.
They practiced, I have a dress on.

990
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,402
Wait. I can do this one.
Hold me, grab me.

991
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:52,788
- Have you got me?
- You know what? I have you.

992
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,448
No one's looking. Get off.

993
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,582
Thank you, thank you.

994
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:01,622
All right, freestyle.

995
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,796
Us too, over here.

996
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:15,807
He did a push-up. He did a push-up.

997
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:23,895
- Well, that was really great.
- They're, like, the perfect couple.

998
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,570
Hold on a sec.

999
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,371
This is our song.

1000
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:42,664
Come on. Come on.

1001
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:46,629
Did you know...

1002
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,588
That the female eagle...

1003
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:58,888
Is attracted to the male...

1004
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:02,107
That can fly the highest?

1005
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:08,405
Soar with me.

1006
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,233
Oh, my gosh.

1007
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:55,448
Yeah.

1008
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:35,693
You know what?
I'm gonna go get some air. Okay.

1009
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:36,906
Thanks.

1010
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:41,282
- Madame, please, don't touch that.
- Sorry.

1011
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:44,580
Okay. All right.

1012
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,716
Come back here. Get down.

1013
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:02,386
This is prohibited.

1014
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:12,988
What's he doing?

1015
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:23,202
Griffin.

1016
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:37,300
Again, I'm so sorry and I'm gonna
reimburse you for everything.

1017
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:38,653
Don't even sweat it, all right.

1018
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:40,306
The ice sculpture was
her mother's idea.

1019
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:42,430
- How is Robin's leg?
- Oh, she's fine.

1020
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:45,687
- It was more of a pull than a tear.
- I hit her so flush.

1021
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,185
- She just went with the fall.
- The legs were:

1022
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,108
- Agile.
- Yeah, she's bendy.

1023
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,810
Don't worry about it. Relax.

1024
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,770
All right. Thanks, bro.

1025
01:02:58,358 --> 01:02:59,701
Listen.

1026
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,988
I don't know what you're trying
to prove with all your silk ribbons...

1027
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:05,327
And your fancy moves...

1028
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:08,118
But what do you say
you just back the hell off?

1029
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:19,220
And what do you say we drop the
moves and we settle this like men?

1030
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:22,550
Okay. Come on, let's go.

1031
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,885
I haven't beaten anybody
senseless since my birthday.

1032
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:30,857
What's up? We gonna do this?

1033
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:36,776
What are you doing?

1034
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:40,992
- What are you doing?
- It's attack position.

1035
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:44,036
Man, it's gotta suck to be you.

1036
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:46,740
Attack.

1037
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,910
Griffin's phone. Go for Bernie.

1038
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:52,871
<i>- I split my pants.</i>
- I'm putting you on speaker.

1039
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:54,130
So how's it going?

1040
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:57,509
<i>What part of "split my pants”
don't you get? My butt's hanging out.</i>

1041
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:00,762
<i>I took out an ice sculpture,
Gale got in my face, it's a mess.</i>

1042
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:03,511
Griffin, if you wanna give up,
I get you.

1043
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:05,137
- He's not giving up.
- Okay.

1044
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,768
Don't back down from that guy.

1045
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:09,475
You get in his face,
make him back down.

1046
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:12,228
<i>As far as the girl goes,
you keep her off balance.</i>

1047
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:14,025
You insult her. That's right.

1048
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:16,733
You make her feel bad.
Then you compliment her.

1049
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:21,366
You knock her down, you bring her up.
When she seems interested, walk away.

1050
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:22,943
Throw poop at her.

1051
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,154
That's how I met Karen.

1052
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:27,785
You can do this.

1053
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:30,333
- Go.
- Close the deal, Griffin.

1054
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:31,994
<i>Throw the poop.</i>

1055
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:34,917
I'm doing this.

1056
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:43,092
- What's up, puppy-breath?
- What?

1057
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,345
Just saying looking good,
freckle-chest, yeah.

1058
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,301
Man, I am hungry.

1059
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,183
Target sighted.

1060
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:59,438
Griffin, what's going on?

1061
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:03,696
Four words:

1062
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:07,908
I need dessert, go.

1063
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:12,659
God, you're beautiful.

1064
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:16,463
- I am?
- Yeah, but you're still here.

1065
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:18,089
Oh, dessert, go...

1066
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:21,047
Okay, I'm going.

1067
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,596
Thanks, boss.

1068
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:31,761
Whoa, guy, back for more?

1069
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:35,690
Does she talk about me?

1070
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:37,518
Sorry?

1071
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:41,696
Does she mention me?

1072
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:44,904
Does the thought of what
Steph and I had haunt you?

1073
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,943
You know, keep you up at night?

1074
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,953
You mean the way you flamed down?

1075
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:50,779
You mean, do we laugh
every time we see

1076
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,283
a couple riding a horse on a beach?

1077
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:54,167
- Oh, yeah.
- Not that specifically.

1078
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:56,419
Every time we see
an engagement ring...

1079
01:05:56,578 --> 01:06:03,052
A whisky bottle with a note in it, a
mariachi band, horse stables or sand.

1080
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,303
We laugh until we can't breathe.

1081
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:07,259
And then we make out...

1082
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,432
Hard.

1083
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:14,934
- Your name's Gale.
- What?

1084
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:17,599
- You have a woman's name.
- No.

1085
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:20,314
No, Gale like Gale Sayers,
the football player.

1086
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:22,650
You wish. Perfume and Teddy bears.

1087
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,565
Daddy must have wanted a little girl,
so he named you Gale.

1088
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:29,118
- Watch it.
- Oh, sorry, Gale, you're a female.

1089
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:33,748
- Hey, man, you better back off.
- Want me to back off, Crystal Gayle?

1090
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:37,919
- You got problems, man.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1091
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,123
Hey.

1092
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:43,049
Not in the mood, hammer thumbs.

1093
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:45,802
Griffin, gone.

1094
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:55,645
- We're leaving.
- Okay.

1095
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:57,688
So tell me everything.

1096
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:01,021
- What was with the robot moves?
- I don't know, I panicked.

1097
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:03,812
I also ripped my pants and
cried a little. It's all a blur.

1098
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,567
That was so fun.

1099
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:10,656
Can we please do this every weekend?

1100
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:14,368
Just show up at weddings and trash
the place? Because we are good.

1101
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:16,126
You know, forget good, we're great.

1102
01:07:16,127 --> 01:07:17,490
And you what?
We're bigger than weddings.

1103
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:18,347
Let me tell you that right now.

1104
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:19,915
- We should rob banks.
- I'm in.

1105
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:23,378
If you would say, "Let us knock off
a gas station," I'd do it right now.

1106
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:27,006
Give me your hand, feel this.
Feel my heartbeat, it's like a rabbit.

1107
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,632
- All right.
- Oh, my God.

1108
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,055
Actually, that's not good.

1109
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:34,009
- Yeah, no, I gotta get that checked.
- Yeah.

1110
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:37,938
And Kate, you were incredible.

1111
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:39,855
Thank you.

1112
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,899
I'm really glad that you asked me
to come out tonight.

1113
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:48,524
Francois.

1114
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:54,780
I heard what happened.

1115
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:58,792
I'm so sorry.
Gale can be such an idiot.

1116
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:01,999
Hey, I know you.

1117
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:05,756
- You're that little zoo girl, right?
- Kate, yeah.

1118
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:10,463
Okay, thank you so much
for saving us from that lion.

1119
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:13,973
Oh, my God, I almost passed out.
I was so scared.

1120
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:20,814
Grif, do you think maybe we could
go somewhere and talk?

1121
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:25,269
- Can we just have a sec?
- Sure.

1122
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,243
It worked. Can you believe it?

1123
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:37,451
Yeah.

1124
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:40,083
That's... that's amazing.

1125
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:43,913
- That's what we came here for, right?
- It is, I...

1126
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,622
- You need to do this.
- Yeah?

1127
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,382
- Yes, yes.
- You helped so much, thank you.

1128
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:51,636
No, I'm just gonna take a taxi,
or a shuttle or something.

1129
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,637
- Go, go.
- Are you sure?

1130
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,345
I can't believe it, thank you.

1131
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,344
Hey, Stephanie.

1132
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,310
- Hey.
- Hi.

1133
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:08,274
<i>Okay, let's review your order.</i>

1134
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:12,532
<i>That'll be 64 meat lover's pizzas,
32 Caesar salads.</i>

1135
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:16,032
<i>And can I interest you in
our new fudge roll?</i>

1136
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,497
Yes.

1137
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:24,628
<i>All right, let's see,
that's a total of $1636 74.</i>

1138
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,170
<i>Will that be cash or credit?</i>

1139
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:29,048
Hang it up, hang it up.

1140
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:30,716
So close.

1141
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:32,840
I am so happy right now.

1142
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:35,547
You know that, ever feel that?
All the time, like...

1143
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:37,761
Are you happy right now?
Because right now I'm so happy.

1144
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:39,860
And it's just like, all of a sudden
it just hits you, like,

1145
01:09:39,861 --> 01:09:41,895
bam, I'm happy now.

1146
01:09:42,053 --> 01:09:45,353
Gosh, you know, I have a fashion show
tomorrow, I want you to come.

1147
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:49,310
Tomorrow, I'm supposed to work.

1148
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:53,231
Sad face.

1149
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,567
- How about instead...
- What?

1150
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:58,532
You come to the zoo.
I give you a private tour.

1151
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:01,535
That's a terrible idea.

1152
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,788
I really thought you were different.

1153
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:07,708
But the same old zoo stuff.

1154
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:13,301
You know what?
Let someone else zoo-keep tomorrow.

1155
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,213
- Really?
- Yeah.

1156
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:20,058
I don't remember this Griffin.

1157
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:24,058
Yeah, well, you get used to it
because now it's all about you.

1158
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:27,391
- Okay.
- You know what else?

1159
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:30,602
You got a bat in the cave.
Yeah, she got a booger.

1160
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:32,270
- No, don't say that.
- Gross.

1161
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:34,565
No, other side, nostril.
Take care of that.

1162
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:36,904
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- You better.

1163
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,068
- Don't go anywhere.
- Not going anywhere.

1164
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:42,489
- Throw out the napkin.
- Okay, I'm so sorry.

1165
01:10:42,697 --> 01:10:46,042
- Dead empty when you get back, woman.
- Okay.

1166
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:57,553
Jurgen. Jurgen.

1167
01:10:57,712 --> 01:10:59,840
- Stephanie.
- Hi.

1168
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,765
Kiss, kiss.

1169
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,807
This is Jurgen Milraux.

1170
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:08,682
Who is this chaotic pile of man?

1171
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:13,771
He's ruining the vibes here.
He is a waste of space.

1172
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:15,605
I'm sorry, what?

1173
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:21,695
You scream, "Help me,
I'm worthless and funny-looking."

1174
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:24,910
Can l...?

1175
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:27,416
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

1176
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,503
- Hey, Siegfried, where's Roy?
- What?

1177
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:34,799
How's the chocolate factory,
Willy Wonka?

1178
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,379
I'm sorry, but you walked
right into that one, grandma hair.

1179
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:40,679
Grandma hair?

1180
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:44,263
<i>♪ He got the grandma hair,
he got the grandma hair.</i>

1181
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:46,018
I don't understand one word.

1182
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:51,354
Here's what you have to understand,
your face is a poem.

1183
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:55,979
I feel...

1184
01:11:57,522 --> 01:11:58,739
...pleasure.

1185
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:05,288
Whoa, let's put the donkey
back in the barn.

1186
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,159
Gonna mingle.

1187
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:22,635
You were awesome in there.
Oh, my God, my friends love you.

1188
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:28,016
You were so great. I gotta say,
you are really getting there.

1189
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:35,231
Look, I hope you don't mind
but I talked to your brother...

1190
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:38,062
And you have a job at the dealership
if you want it.

1191
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:42,241
Is that pushy?
Hey, you know what? Fine, I'm pushy.

1192
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,777
It's just...

1193
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:48,494
I think that that zoo
is really holding you back.

1194
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:51,793
You deserve better.

1195
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:57,460
We deserve better.

1196
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:00,880
We?

1197
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:20,859
Good call, Glenn.
An animal like you on this bad boy?

1198
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:23,571
It's top of the food chain. Follow.

1199
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:30,119
Shana, wanna grab us
an espresso and a Montblanc?

1200
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:32,704
- We're having a signing party.
- Yes, sir.

1201
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:34,706
Enjoy the hunt.

1202
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:41,883
Dancing.

1203
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:02,481
- Back off, Nimer.
- You back off.

1204
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:04,740
- Oh, not cool.
- Yeah.

1205
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:08,031
What's up?

1206
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:11,118
- Welcome to the dream.
- Help!

1207
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,955
I don't like this thing!
Make it stop, make it stop!

1208
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:31,680
- That looks difficult.
- You know what's not difficult?

1209
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:33,515
Giving a supermodel the bad news...

1210
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:37,057
That I can't date you because
I'm already dating a supermodel.

1211
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:43,900
Yeah.

1212
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:52,951
- I gotta say, this is incredible.
- Where have you been?

1213
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:56,410
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about, I...

1214
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:57,792
It's time.

1215
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:00,955
Oh, my God, he's calling,
letting her know he's here.

1216
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,916
Watch this, look, look, look.

1217
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:08,216
- Aren't they amazing?
- Yeah, no...

1218
01:15:08,379 --> 01:15:11,553
They're great.
They're fast and sincere.

1219
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:15,562
- Did you know they mate for life?
- I do now.

1220
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:18,890
Listen, Kate, I wanted you
to be the first to know...

1221
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:22,606
That I took a job working
for my brother at his dealership.

1222
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:29,367
- Shut up.
- I'm serious, I figured I'd...

1223
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:33,280
I'd done everything I set out to do
in the zoo game and it was ....

1224
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:37,041
The zoo game? What the hell
are you talking about, Griffin?

1225
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:40,294
You love working here, you're great
at it. The animals love you.

1226
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,431
Yeah, but maybe that's not enough.

1227
01:15:42,432 --> 01:15:45,425
Yeah, maybe it's time I just start
thinking about myself.

1228
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:48,127
Okay, is this coming
from you or Stephanie?

1229
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:52,549
No, it's my decision. I mean, she
thinks it's a good idea, but I do too.

1230
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:56,598
Not buying it. You can't see
what's happening here?

1231
01:15:56,761 --> 01:15:58,308
Yeah, I am changing me.

1232
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:01,812
No, she's changing you
into something that you're not.

1233
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:04,314
Well, maybe what I was before
wasn't what I was.

1234
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:08,903
And it is now, maybe, that it is
if it is the way it is.

1235
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:12,280
- You're not even making any sense.
- Makes enough sense that you get it.

1236
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:15,659
Okay, look...

1237
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:19,667
If you wanna quit,
I'm not gonna stand in your way.

1238
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:22,412
But I want you to look me in the eye,

1239
01:16:22,422 --> 01:16:24,998
and tell me that this is actually
what you really want.

1240
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:33,847
It is.

1241
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:38,101
There you have it.

1242
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:05,663
Hey, Bern...

1243
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:08,795
Got your favorite.

1244
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:16,803
- Hey, listen, I just wanted to...
- Save it.

1245
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:18,429
I already heard.

1246
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:23,894
You know, you almost had me
convinced things could be different.

1247
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:27,276
That I could actually trust
someone again.

1248
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:31,314
You can.

1249
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:37,361
Oh, I gotta take this. One sec.

1250
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:39,201
Yo, go for Grif.

1251
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:42,537
No, mohegan blue.
Chrome wheel package, buddy.

1252
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:46,955
Papers are all ready for you,
make it happen, slam it.

1253
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:48,373
All right, gotta go.

1254
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:49,756
Oh, sorry, Bern.

1255
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:55,009
All people lie and
I was an idiot to believe you.

1256
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:20,863
Hey, Shane.

1257
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:24,408
I'm gonna let you in
on a little something.

1258
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:27,249
Ten years ago,
you and Bernie had an incident.

1259
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:31,333
I know what you did.
I also know you lied about it.

1260
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:35,090
So?

1261
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:39,302
So if you ever do
anything like that again...

1262
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:44,562
I will go to your house and I will
beat you in front of your mother.

1263
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:58,694
I'm telling you, Vern, this baby does
zero to 60 in under four seconds.

1264
01:18:58,901 --> 01:19:00,995
Yeah, I don't know, I...

1265
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:03,656
- I got grandkids.
- That's even better.

1266
01:19:03,864 --> 01:19:07,209
You stick them back here.
You tell them it's a secret cave.

1267
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:28,347
I can't take it. I miss Griffin.

1268
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:31,229
I know you can't see it
but my lip won't stop quivering.

1269
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:33,222
Well, he wouldn't be gone if
you'd listened to me.

1270
01:19:33,223 --> 01:19:34,677
You're the one that talk to him first.

1271
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:37,819
- Yeah, he's right, you know?
- I can't take it.

1272
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:41,493
- You're killing us with the crying.
- You were sobbing all night.

1273
01:19:41,652 --> 01:19:44,451
- I wasn't, I have sleep apnea.
- Sounded like baby-crying to me.

1274
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:46,828
- Baby-crying.
- What did you say, Thumbs?

1275
01:19:46,991 --> 01:19:49,089
Why don't you come back
here and say it to my face.

1276
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:50,837
I leave this tree,
I'm slapping you silly.

1277
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:53,123
You come down here
and I'll use you as a loofah.

1278
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:55,073
How're you gonna hold me?
You have no thumbs.

1279
01:19:55,075 --> 01:19:55,740
Oh, yeah?

1280
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:58,173
Let's do this. I'll start from
my back. Bring it.

1281
01:19:58,377 --> 01:19:59,946
That's it, I'm quitting my diet.

1282
01:19:59,947 --> 01:20:02,007
You can't quit something
you never started.

1283
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:05,514
- You know what I think we should do?
- Not a zoo animal!

1284
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:11,015
Hey, Kate.

1285
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:14,776
Hey, Venom.
Oh, what are they doing out?

1286
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:16,903
Grieving. They miss Griffin.

1287
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:20,483
- Oh, I know how they feel.
- Yeah.

1288
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:26,789
Look, Venom, I'm sorry,
but I'm leaving the zoo tomorrow.

1289
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,918
- You too?
- Yeah.

1290
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:36,921
The eagle enclosure is up and running
so I'm taking a job in Nairobi.

1291
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:38,876
Why?

1292
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:43,306
I was gonna pass because I started
having feelings for someone here...

1293
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:47,810
But he's with somebody else, so....

1294
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:50,312
You know?

1295
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:52,890
I do.

1296
01:20:58,312 --> 01:20:59,359
What are you doing?

1297
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:02,821
Oh, what are you doing?
Don't you play possum.

1298
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:04,447
- What?
- You know?

1299
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:06,528
You started having feelings.

1300
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:09,949
Come on, "someone here."

1301
01:21:11,033 --> 01:21:13,331
I was talking about Griffin.

1302
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:16,379
Tragic misread of situation.

1303
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:24,639
<i>Feel as though
you're breathing through your eyes.</i>

1304
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:27,846
Hey, babe, how was your day?
Did you sell a lot of cars?

1305
01:21:28,008 --> 01:21:32,013
Three, but you know what? One
guy, he didn't feel like he needed it.

1306
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:37,234
- Do you love it?
- Trying to complete the pose ....

1307
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:40,192
- Is that a chair?
- Yes, it's a Chintoko.

1308
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:41,014
- Really?
- There's only five

1309
01:21:41,015 --> 01:21:43,654
like it in the entire world.

1310
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:45,234
Sit, sit, sit.

1311
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,362
- Yeah, okay.
- I love it.

1312
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,914
- Isn't it comfy, cozy?
- Yeah.

1313
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:55,123
Totally amazing. I just think
this whole place looks so great.

1314
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:58,297
It's really just...
it's coming together.

1315
01:21:58,497 --> 01:21:59,919
I'm so happy.

1316
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:03,799
Really gives this whole room
a nice zhuzh. You know what I mean?

1317
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:07,597
Hey, you know what? I ordered in
dinner tonight from Le Chereaux.

1318
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:09,050
Oh, you know what else?

1319
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:14,017
That just reminds me, we have an
absinthe tasting on Mathieu sailboat.

1320
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:16,223
- Yeah, Mathieu.
- Do you remember him?

1321
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:19,360
He's disgustingly rich.

1322
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,233
Okay, I gotta get my yoga.

1323
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:24,862
Hey babe, you think it's bad feng shui
that we have a tv in the living room?

1324
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:26,491
I feel if I do yoga in here...

1325
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:29,870
It will counterbalance
the whole bad juju, you know?

1326
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:31,780
Bad juju of the tv.

1327
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:36,790
Wait till I show you
this new dress I bought.

1328
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:54,679
What's wrong?

1329
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,641
Hoping for someone else?

1330
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,529
Hungry?

1331
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:15,290
Guys, see that lady over there?

1332
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:18,791
I just sold her an extended warranty
we don't even have.

1333
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:20,875
Nice, guy, nice.

1334
01:23:21,038 --> 01:23:24,212
We've got a high roller checking out
the Mercedes McLaren.

1335
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:36,262
Knock yourself out, Nimer.

1336
01:23:37,304 --> 01:23:39,853
Oh, you got a good eye.

1337
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:44,987
Griffin Constantine Keyes.

1338
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:46,863
The changes I've seen in you...

1339
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:51,118
These past few weeks
have been nothing short of remarkable.

1340
01:23:52,194 --> 01:23:54,288
And I've been doing
a little soul-searching.

1341
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:58,413
And I made a mistake five years ago
on that beach.

1342
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:00,309
And I wanna correct it.

1343
01:24:01,801 --> 01:24:03,925
- So will you...?
- Yeah, not gonna happen.

1344
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:09,302
What?

1345
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:11,429
Come on, you had to see this coming.

1346
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:14,888
Look, when we first started dating
you assumed I was gonna turn into...

1347
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:17,724
The type of guy
you always dreamed about.

1348
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:19,729
But you know what?

1349
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:21,856
I don't like that guy.

1350
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:24,814
I don't like this job.
I don't, bro, I'm sorry.

1351
01:24:25,018 --> 01:24:28,272
It's not... yeah, this I love.
But we'll always have this, you know?

1352
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,107
I love you, right? Okay, good.

1353
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:33,068
I don't like this suit.
I don't like our chintaki chairs.

1354
01:24:33,277 --> 01:24:35,075
- Chintoko.
- Either one, I don't like them.

1355
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:37,424
I don't like the facts
that I can't understand

1356
01:24:37,425 --> 01:24:39,250
90 percent of the
stuff you talk about.

1357
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:44,797
But most of all,
I hate who I've become.

1358
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:55,424
I'll ignore them.

1359
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,435
Shut up.

1360
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:05,977
Shut up, he didn't say yes.
I'm not gonna pay you.

1361
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:20,498
Come back for your watch?

1362
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:25,288
No, I came back to see if you were
interested in happy hour at Friday's.

1363
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:28,499
Look, if you're here just to
yank my chain...

1364
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:31,339
I'm not. I wanna tell you I'm sorry.

1365
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:33,841
And I know I let you down.

1366
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:37,516
And that you... you're my best friend.

1367
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:47,192
And, oh, yeah, I...
I dumped Stephanie.

1368
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:51,238
- Nicely done.
- Yeah.

1369
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:55,993
- Hey, what happened to your eye?
- It's good to have you back, Grif.

1370
01:25:57,277 --> 01:25:58,904
Hey, Griffin, you're back.

1371
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:00,785
Oh, everyone's gonna be so happy.

1372
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:03,160
You know what, right now I gotta
go talk to Kate, okay?

1373
01:26:03,161 --> 01:26:04,622
Griffin, Kate's gone.

1374
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:07,579
- She's leaving for Africa tonight.
- What?

1375
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:10,044
She's on a 9:15 flight.

1376
01:26:10,248 --> 01:26:13,127
Oh, man, it's my fault.

1377
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:15,341
- I blew it.
- It's my fault.

1378
01:26:15,545 --> 01:26:17,809
I was the who told you
to be someone you're not.

1379
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:19,675
No, you know what? It's my fault.

1380
01:26:19,883 --> 01:26:23,012
I was so worried you were gonna leave,
I wasn't thinking about you.

1381
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:26,144
It's not my fault. I said
throw poop at her, always works.

1382
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:29,685
Who cares whose fault it is?

1383
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:33,105
There's still time. Let's get Kate.

1384
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:38,240
Follow me, everyone.
Nothing can stand in our way.

1385
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:42,156
Wow, he is really hauling.

1386
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:43,869
Oh, he stopped.

1387
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:45,046
He's eating a pretzel.

1388
01:26:45,047 --> 01:26:47,411
You know what!
Barry is right, I'm going to get her.

1389
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:50,873
Wait, it's bumper to bumper from here
to the airport. Whoa, almost took off.

1390
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:53,960
My gosh, you're right.
It's rush hour, I'll never make it.

1391
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:56,795
I can get you there.
I'm the fastest animal in the zoo.

1392
01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:59,010
Plus, I fit in the bike Lane. Hop on.

1393
01:27:01,258 --> 01:27:02,760
Hop off, hop off.

1394
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:08,481
New plan. Follow me.

1395
01:27:10,142 --> 01:27:11,689
Griffin, I got your back, baby.

1396
01:27:16,106 --> 01:27:17,278
Wait, where you going?

1397
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:21,157
Hey, Griffin, you nut.
What are you doing back there?

1398
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:23,332
Nothing, everything is fine.

1399
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:25,400
Can't be in that area,
it's unauthorized.

1400
01:27:25,401 --> 01:27:28,039
I know but a guy inside said it's
okay. They will allow it this time.

1401
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,587
All right! Listen, I'm having a party
Saturday night, a blowout.

1402
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:32,919
Sounds good, I'm there.
I love blowouts.

1403
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:35,000
- It's gonna be wild.
- Yeah, yeah... I'll see you saturday.

1404
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:37,256
- Where you going, Griffin?
- Hey, come on... get out.

1405
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:40,431
- I can do this.
- Wait, don't leave.

1406
01:27:40,589 --> 01:27:42,683
- Okay.
- Can't you hear what I'm saying?

1407
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:45,185
Hey, Griffin! I'm saying...

1408
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:10,831
Hey.

1409
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:23,840
Hang on a second.

1410
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:26,097
Where are we going?
You can't leave me here.

1411
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:28,929
I'm out of the zoo without my izod.

1412
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:32,019
Griffin, what a surprise.

1413
01:28:32,182 --> 01:28:33,650
Hi, Mrs. D.

1414
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:40,364
Hey.

1415
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:46,621
Ma!

1416
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:50,037
- Take a cookie, sweetie.
- Oh, thanks, Mrs. D.

1417
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,497
Ma!

1418
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:05,887
- Come on, the road's blocked.
- Yeah, oh...

1419
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:08,685
How about this?
I'll go around the back.

1420
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:26,157
Come on. What do we do?

1421
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:32,371
Oh, you...

1422
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:34,707
You know what?
A heads up would be nice.

1423
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:36,872
Go, I'll meet you there.

1424
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:48,387
Kate!

1425
01:29:50,969 --> 01:29:52,937
Wait, stop!

1426
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:55,599
Kate!

1427
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:58,401
Oh, God, she's gone.

1428
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,779
- It's over.
- It's not over.

1429
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,367
Get in.

1430
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:17,254
- Stay in sync.
- I'm trying.

1431
01:30:17,454 --> 01:30:19,502
Your arms are twice as long as mine.

1432
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:23,677
Hurry, we gotta cut her off at the
bridge or she's gone.

1433
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:26,008
Row, gorilla, row.

1434
01:30:26,171 --> 01:30:29,801
Come on, use those big arms, baby.
Now we're doing it.

1435
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:32,685
Row, row, row.

1436
01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:41,812
Bernie.

1437
01:30:46,316 --> 01:30:48,819
I was kind of hoping we'd
see some steps.

1438
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:50,737
- Get on.
- What?

1439
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:53,202
- Get on my back.
- Okay.

1440
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:03,508
You know what?

1441
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:06,420
I don't think I can do this.
I'm afraid of heights.

1442
01:31:06,586 --> 01:31:08,133
- Oh, no.
- Don't look down.

1443
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:12,471
- That's not helping.
- Don't look up.

1444
01:31:13,677 --> 01:31:17,022
Bernie, I'm looking down.
This is not good, give me your hand.

1445
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:39,540
There she is.

1446
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:48,882
Hurry, she's on the move.

1447
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:52,348
What are you stopping for?

1448
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:56,432
Just be yourself, Griffin.
That's all you need to do.

1449
01:31:56,594 --> 01:31:59,848
- Now go get your girl.
- How?

1450
01:32:07,313 --> 01:32:08,906
- Griffin?
- Kate, hey.

1451
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:11,443
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Yeah.

1452
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:14,203
- What the hell are you doing?
- I was cartwheeling.

1453
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:15,830
- What?
- I...

1454
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:17,036
Oh, you said...

1455
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:19,951
- You said eagles, they mate for life.
- Yes.

1456
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:23,839
Well, when an eagle finds it's
perfect mate, they cartwheel, right?

1457
01:32:23,997 --> 01:32:26,566
That's what they do.
They lock their talons together

1458
01:32:26,567 --> 01:32:28,844
and they spin out of control.

1459
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:32,844
And just before they hit the ground,
they break apart.

1460
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,810
The only difference
between me and an eagle is...

1461
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:39,308
I will hit the ground as
you've just seen.

1462
01:32:41,931 --> 01:32:45,606
You said you were done
with the zoo game.

1463
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:48,939
I thought I had to change
who I was to be happy...

1464
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:50,482
But I was wrong.

1465
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:53,735
Kate, it took me five years
to get over someone

1466
01:32:53,736 --> 01:32:56,663
I wasn't even in love with.

1467
01:32:56,821 --> 01:33:00,166
I can't imagine how long it would 
take to get over you.

1468
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:05,710
And on a side note, I may have
crushed an ostrich getting here.

1469
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:10,427
I don't wanna know.
I don't wanna know.

1470
01:33:26,184 --> 01:33:27,902
- He's fine, he's...
- No, no.

1471
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:30,063
Yeah, we should get him back,
we should.

1472
01:33:59,592 --> 01:34:04,189
Wait a sec. What the heck is benihana?

1473
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:07,650
You still got your izod?

1474
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:49,893
Get it.

1475
01:34:52,562 --> 01:34:54,735
I can't get it off.

1476
01:34:55,732 --> 01:34:57,109
I don't know what that was.

1477
01:35:01,321 --> 01:35:03,415
Share the road. You all right?

1478
01:35:09,996 --> 01:35:11,043
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1479
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:54,962
What is he doing?

1480
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:56,918
That's a crazy stance right there.

1481
01:36:00,004 --> 01:36:01,051
You don't stay... You...

1482
01:36:01,214 --> 01:36:03,592
I mean, you just stay,
don't go anywhere.

1483
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:26,539
Yeah, baby.

1484
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:28,371
Okay, that...

1485
01:36:29,575 --> 01:36:33,876
Whoa, man, I feel like I went
through a car wash right then.

1486
01:36:36,082 --> 01:36:38,380
All right, all right, be careful.

1487
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:58,800
