1
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,551
Look at them go! Into the final lap.

2
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,479
And here comes number seven...

3
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,470
Dusty Crophopper!

4
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,079
And Dusty wins the gold!

5
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,706
Go, Duster!

6
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,839
Dusty, you were just a
small-town crop duster

7
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,559
who overcame impossible odds to win
the Wings Around the Globe Rally.

9
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,679
And now, you're an air racing legend.

10
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,839
Well, Brent, I've had an amazing team
supporting me every step of the way.

11
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,479
The best coach, the best mechanic...

12
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,519
and the best fuel truck
that anyone could ask for.

13
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,679
Hey, wait a minute.
You're a gas consultant.

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,865
That's correct. I've got gas.

15
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,119
Awesome pic, Dust,
except your eyes are closed.

16
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,439
Racing with your eyes closed,
huh? So, that's your secret.

17
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,879
Oh, yeah, you figured it out, Chug.

18
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,519
That was some pretty
fancy flying, Dusty.

19
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,068
Saw it all on my radio with pictures.

20
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,199
Um, you mean your TV.

21
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,559
No, no. That's clearing up.

22
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,879
My bumper was nearly
corroded right through.

23
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,159
- All right.
- Disgusting looking.

24
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,399
Ah, yeah, it was all
rusty and blistered.

25
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,159
I got it. Anyway,
what else is going on?

26
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,559
Dottie gave me some of that Rust-eze
Medicated Bumper Ointment.

27
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,079
- How's it look now?
- Looks great. Fine.

28
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,239
- Take a closer look.
- That's close enough.

29
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,799
- Oh.
- What was that?

30
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,599
Didn't need to see that.

31
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,399
Oh, hey, hey, guys, guys.
Listen to this.

32
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,399
"After his Red Bulldozer win,
Dusty Crophopper..."

33
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,319
- That's you.
- "... returns to Propwash Junction..."

34
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,879
- That's here.
- "...where he will be performing

35
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,399
"at their annual Corn Festival."

36
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,919
They mentioned the Corn Festival?

37
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,959
Oh, it's national news!

38
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,799
Seriously? That's great.

39
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,119
Yeah. The phone's been ringing
off the hook here at the motel.

40
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,199
Gonna have to get out
the inflatable hangars.

41
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,519
Oh, yeah, everybody
wants to see you, Dusty.

42
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,119
It's gonna be the
biggest Corn Fest yet.

43
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,621
Dusty.

44
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,679
- Ready to do some flying?
- Absolutely, Skipper.

45
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,639
- Don't stay out too late.
- Later, Dust.

46
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,869
Remember to open your eyes.

47
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,919
Hey, Propwash Tower,
this is Crophopper Seven.

48
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,679
Flight of two, ready for takeoff.

49
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,479
Crophopper Seven, Propwash Tower.

50
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,039
Wind's calm. Runway
two-seven clear for takeoff.

51
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,269
Have a great flight, fellas.

52
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,943
Crophopper Seven flight, on the roll.

53
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,106
Snap into those turns.

54
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,826
Tighten it up.

55
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,590
There you go.

56
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,261
Now let's work that vertical!

57
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,159
Dusty!

58
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,559
- Dusty, are you okay?
- My engine.

59
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,239
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, steady, there.

60
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,279
Propwash Tower,
this is Jolly Wrench Seven.

61
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,759
We're a flight of two,
five miles north of the airport...

62
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,559
inbound for a precautionary landing.

63
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,359
Roger. Proceed direct to the numbers.

64
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,079
Wind two-seven zero at five.

65
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,503
Runway two-seven clear to land.

66
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,119
I don't know what it was.

67
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,559
I wasn't doing anything different.

68
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,519
Pylon turns, a vertical,
like we do every day.

69
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,759
I feel great now, but...

70
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,439
I got a love-hate relationship
with you, Dusty.

71
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,439
Love that you're my best customer,
hate what you're doing to yourself.

72
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,799
Come on, Dot. You saw me
at the Red Bulldozer race.

73
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,119
I kicked Aston Martin out there!

74
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,439
You're not even listening
to what I'm saying.

75
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,839
And hey, Speed City Airfest
is just a few weeks away.

76
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,519
And I think, if I get a little
more speed coming out of my turns,

77
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,359
really work that radial-G,
I can definitely improve my time.

78
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,679
Yeah, I'm feeling it.

79
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,879
I'm feeling good about my next race.

80
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,839
Well, no damage to the
casing or compressor blades.

81
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,359
See? I told you. Just a hiccup.

82
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,639
- But there is...
- Dusty! Dusty!

83
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,119
What happened? Are you okay, Dust?

84
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,319
It's okay.

85
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,319
Was it your fuel?
I tested it this morning.

86
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,919
I always take a little sip.
Gets me going.

87
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,119
It's okay. I got quite
a little scare there.

88
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,479
- But Dottie here...
- Dusty!

89
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,479
And it's all good news,
gave me the all-clear.

90
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,142
Your reduction gearbox is failing.

91
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,359
My gearbox?

92
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,079
Your chip detector had a cluster
of steel shavings on it.

93
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,079
Flakes from the gears.
That's what caused the trouble.

94
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,279
Well, you could just replace it.

95
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,599
Order a new one from A-G Parts.

96
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,909
It'll be here by the end of the week.

97
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,906
Right?

98
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,666
What?

99
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,639
Your gearbox... It's...

100
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,945
It's out of production.
Long since discontinued.

101
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,101
Can't even remember
the last time I saw one.

102
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,359
But, Dottie...

103
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,679
Come on, can't you just
build Dust a new one?

104
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,119
No. It's too complex.
It has to be factory.

105
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,639
Well, I mean, there has...

106
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,119
From now on, you have
to back off the torque.

107
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,639
Keep it under 80 percent.

108
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,239
What? 80 percent?

109
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,359
Dottie, you've got me
cranked up to 140.

110
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,959
I need that to race.

111
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,159
If you push yourself into the red,

112
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,999
- your gearbox will fail.
- No, Dottie!

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,359
And then your engine will seize.

114
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,399
- Maybe the test that you did was wrong!
- Dusty, listen!

115
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,479
But I've got a race coming up!

116
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,186
You'll crash!

117
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,319
You push yourself into
the red, you'll crash.

118
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,519
Look, I'm gonna install a
warning light on your panel.

119
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,639
A warning light?

120
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,359
If it comes on,
you'll need to pull power.

121
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,599
Slow down.

122
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,239
But, Dottie...

123
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,424
You're saying...

124
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,742
I can't race anymore.

125
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,830
I'm so sorry.

126
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,359
I was making my descent

127
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,225
To the old "BNA"

128
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,479
At gate number three
Concourse A

129
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,599
Can you believe it?
She left me for a hybrid.

130
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,159
I didn't even hear him coming.

131
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,239
And there I saw a wide-body jet

132
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,759
Make me pitch and yaw

133
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,549
My runway romance
At gate number three

134
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,999
All right, boys,
I got three Crudeweisers,

135
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,279
and who ordered the Spruce Goose?

136
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,959
What? It's tangy.

137
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,959
Hey, sugar rims,
you just fall out of a B-17?

138
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,919
'Cause you're da bomb.

139
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,119
- Pickup trucks.
- Mmm-hmm.

140
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,199
Dottie's an excellent mechanic.

141
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,039
You know as well as I,
she wouldn't have said

142
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,839
what she said unless she was sure.

143
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,599
- Hey, Dusty! Dusty!
- Hey, Dusty!

144
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,079
- Dusty, hey!
- There he is.

145
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,839
Dust, listen, we just got off the
radio with Ethan up in Grand Flaps.

146
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,199
Old "Grand Flaps Ethan."

147
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,319
He's got the gearbox?

148
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,599
No.

149
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,919
But his buddy owns

150
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,359
- 21 service hangars.
- 21!

151
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,759
Twenty-one of them,
and he's gonna check his inventory,

152
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,359
and he's gonna put the
word out for you, Duster.

153
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,599
- It's a good start, right?
- Oh, yeah!

154
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,799
It's a great start!
Can you believe it?

155
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,799
Because if that gearbox is out there,
we're gonna find it for you, buddy.

156
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,959
And, hey, if you don't,
it's all right.

157
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,039
- Because the answer is "Yes."
- "Yes?"

158
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,119
- What?
- Yes?

159
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,199
Huh?

160
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,119
Yes, of course you can
have your old job back.

161
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,599
Don't even have to bother asking.
That's just the kind of guy I am.

162
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,599
Leadbottom, I'm sure
Dusty appreciates your offer...

163
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,399
Of course, you got to start
back at minimum wage,

164
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,679
and you lost all your vacation time,
gotta go through orientation again.

165
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,799
Leadbottom, please!

166
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,639
Once you acquire the
taste for Vitaminamulch,

167
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,959
you can't live without it.

168
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,384
It's like Mama's
jalapeno chili. Spicy.

169
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,479
Twice!

170
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,959
It's just that now is
not the best time.

171
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,319
Come on, Skipper.

172
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,559
I can get his old sprayer
back from that Germany place.

173
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,461
Have it cleaned up and bolted
back on him in no time.

174
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,079
I'll tell you what,
let me buy you a can of oil.

175
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,479
I'll tell you what, Dusty is the
best duster I've ever known.

177
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,279
And I'm telling you that Dusty
don't crop dust no more.

178
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,359
That's right, no more!

179
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,639
- He's a racer.
- A racer!

180
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,719
He's gonna be back
to racing in no time.

181
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,799
In no time!

182
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,559
- Right, Dusty?
- Right, Dust?

183
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,061
Dust?

184
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,079
Agh!

185
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,786
Argh!

186
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,066
Uh!

187
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,146
Ugh!

188
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,999
Fire. Fire!

189
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,079
Somebody get some help!

190
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,359
The Fill 'n Fly!

191
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,101
- I'll go get Mayday.
- I'll hit the shut-off valve.

192
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,839
Oh, I'm on it!

193
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,319
Had to get my glasses.

194
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,439
Now, listen up!

195
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,181
We gotta cool this down
before it spreads.

196
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,987
Oh, yeah!

197
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,679
Uh?

198
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,999
Whoa!

199
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,184
- I got you.
- Thanks.

200
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,301
Now what?

201
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,150
I'm gonna need some help.

202
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,781
Now, pull!

203
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,345
Pull!

204
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,399
"TMST"?

205
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,028
"This Means Serious Trouble."

206
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,439
"Transportation
Management Safety Team."

207
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,199
Mr. Mayday, were you at
the specified point of attack,

208
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,559
and applying an extinguishing agent

209
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,789
within three minutes
from the time of alarm?

210
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,359
Well, I...

211
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,750
I didn't have time
to look at a clock.

212
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,467
Is that guy writing
down everything I say?

213
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,589
- Yes.
- Well, I...

214
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,279
- So he just wrote that down?
- Yes.

215
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,624
- And that?
- Yes.

216
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,181
Oh.

217
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,759
Can you provide me with
your self-inspection records

218
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,919
and emergency procedure plans?

219
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,239
Oh, look, now, we don't have
many emergencies around here.

220
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,759
Besides, we did get the fire out.

221
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,559
Is that your contingency
plan, Mr. Mayday?

222
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,239
Every time there's an incident,
you topple a water tower?

223
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,279
This was my fault.

224
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,439
Hmm?

225
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,239
I clipped the tower.

226
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,479
I flew out last night because I...

227
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,119
Dusty.

228
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,224
It was an accident.

229
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,239
It's clear this airport has
no plans for an emergency,

230
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,239
and equipment from last century.

231
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,759
So, unless Mr. Mayday
gets refurbished,

232
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,759
and acquires a second
fire-fighting vehicle

233
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,239
in accordance with CFR
title 14, volume three,

234
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,839
chapter one, section 139,
sub-paragraph B,

235
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,079
I am pulling this airport's
certificate of operation

236
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,279
for non-compliance of rescue
and fire-fighting regulations.

237
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,111
Oh, Chevy.

238
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,999
Propwash Junction just got shut down?

239
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,759
With no active runway,
how can anybody land?

240
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,919
They can't. That's the problem.

241
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,919
There goes the Corn Festival.

242
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,919
But I already finished
my corncob costume.

243
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,639
Now, everybody, calm down.

244
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,839
- Calm down?
- Calm down.

245
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,479
Calm down? Motel's booked.

246
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,279
This Corn Festival is
what butters my corn.

247
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,519
Brodi, we've already
figured this out.

248
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,465
Dottie, show them.

249
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,799
This is Mayday now.

250
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,959
I did the drawings.

251
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,799
We add a new 400-watt siren,
a 2,000 GPM roof turret,

252
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,719
a high-capacity water tank with
integrated class A foam cell,

253
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,799
and we'll have an all-new Mayday.

254
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,959
Get out! He gets rocket boosters?

255
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,879
That's right. Fuelled by good old
hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide.

256
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,719
Of course, remember,
that stuff is highly explosive,

257
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,959
so you'll want to keep it
away from any open flames.

258
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,879
But he's a fire truck.

259
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,399
Exactly. Go on, Dottie.

260
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,639
So, for Mayday to keep his job
and get Propwash reopened,

261
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,479
we just need to find
a second firefighter.

262
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,959
What? At this time of year?
It's fire season.

263
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,679
How much is another
firefighter gonna cost?

264
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,759
I'll tell you how much. Too much!

265
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,999
If we hire one,
we might as well hire two.

266
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,879
Oh, for crying out loud.

267
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,190
Gee, this tarmac is
getting awful hot.

268
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,239
Knock, knock.

269
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,344
Oh.

270
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,863
Hey, Dusty.

271
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,506
I just...

272
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,959
Hmm.

273
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,279
I wish there was, uh...

274
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,386
You know, I wish there was
something I could do.

275
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,751
Oh, there's nothing. It's all right.

276
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,383
I'm old, Dusty.

277
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,399
Looks like my firefighting
days are over.

278
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,559
Uh, no.

279
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,719
No, Mayday.

280
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,199
Look, there's still plenty
of firefight left in you.

281
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,239
Look at...

282
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,559
I mean, right here,
"Firefighter of the Year."

283
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,759
Huh, 1968.

284
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,399
Okay. Your Bronze Star.

285
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,743
Old and tarnished.

286
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,504
Like me.

287
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,101
Oh.

288
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,319
Is this you and an old crop duster?

289
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,559
- Hmm?
- This one, right here.

290
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,319
Oh, yeah.

291
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,079
Mendocino, 1956.

292
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,159
Oh, '55, '55.

293
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,399
Yeah, I was there. Yeah, I was there.

294
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,799
I got to witness one of the
very first aerial firefighters.

295
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,479
- Oh.
- Nowadays known as a "SEAT."

296
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,759
A "SEAT"?

297
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,519
Yeah. A "Single Engine Air Tanker."

298
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,599
Huh.

299
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,068
You see, instead of dusting crops,

300
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,799
you know, like you used
to do, they drop water.

302
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,541
- Wow.
- Yeah.

303
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,599
Uh,

304
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,119
Mayday?

305
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,621
Mmm-hmm?

306
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,864
What if I became our
second firefighter?

307
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,279
You?

308
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,151
Yeah. Dottie will fix you
up, and I'll get certified.

310
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,999
What about your racing?

311
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,039
Look. Right now, we need
to get Propwash reopened.

312
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,780
Me...

313
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,785
And you.

314
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,621
I don't know what to say.

315
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,145
Thanks, Dusty.

316
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,039
One, two, three,
lil' jon-jon, and five.

317
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,799
Okay, that's it.
That's the morning rush.

318
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,879
Highway's all clear, Duster.

319
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,879
Now, when you get to
Piston Peak Air Attack,

320
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,839
you're gonna ask for Blade Ranger.

321
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,999
Blade Ranger.

322
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,159
You got it. Yeah.

323
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,639
He's their Chief of Fire and Rescue.

324
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,159
He's an old friend of mine.

325
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,159
He can train and certify you.

326
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,879
Consider it done, Mayday.

327
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,719
And, Dusty, be careful.

328
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,506
I will.

329
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,199
Good luck, Dusty!

330
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,919
Take it easy out there!

331
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,519
You can do it, Dusty.

332
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,159
We're proud of you, pal!

333
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,947
Good luck!

334
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,351
There's a time

335
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,185
In your life

336
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,627
When the world

337
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,782
ls on your side

338
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,959
You might not feel it

339
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,919
You might not see it

340
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,959
But it surrounds you like a light

341
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,079
Makes you stronger for the fight

342
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,039
Never letting go
Gotta learn to grow

343
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:59,102
Watch me as I touch the sky

344
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,102
Still I fly

345
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,399
Now I know it's what I gotta do

346
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,559
Find a dream that's new

347
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:14,559
Give it all I got this time

348
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,825
Still I fly

349
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,679
Oh, Harvey,
it's just like I remember.

350
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,599
Winnie, how many pairs
of tires did you pack?

351
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,599
Harvey, you spoiled it.

352
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,750
Now you spoiled the moment.

353
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,439
Breathe it in I'm gonna shine

354
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,279
It's my moment
Gotta live it, live it right

355
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,104
I'm flying
Flying so strong

356
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,639
Hello! Welcome, guests,

357
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,826
to the grand reopening weekend
of the magnificent Fusel Lodge!

358
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,999
Ah, we're gonna wipe off
those muddy tires, aren't we?

359
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,319
Yes, we are.

360
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,788
Oh! Good heavens!
Look who we have here!

361
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,839
Never letting go
Gotta learn to grow

362
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,159
Watch me as I touch the sky

363
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,799
Oh still I fly

364
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:20,625
Still I fly

365
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,519
Argh! Stick shift!

366
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,399
- Ripping!
- Whoa!

367
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,039
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

368
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,999
Drip, what the heck is
the matter with you?

369
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,359
You nearly took off the guy's canopy!

370
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,479
But Blackout said it
was okay to go, dude.

371
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,559
- I did?
- He did?

372
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,559
Yeah, he was like,
"He's okay to go, dude."

373
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,039
- Hmm.
- Uh, I'm sorry.

374
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,559
I know you're busy, but I am looking
for Piston Peak Air Attack.

376
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,679
You are there!

377
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,670
Copy that, jefe.

378
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,879
Serving beautiful Vee-Six
Valley since 1958.

379
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,879
You must be the SEAT. Hmm.

380
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,239
We heard you were coming.

381
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,359
I'm Dynamite. This is Blackout,

382
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,239
- Pinecone, Avalanche...
- Hello!

383
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,719
...and Evel Kenumbskull
over there is Drip.

384
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,159
Did you guys see that?

385
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,319
Hey, guys, what's up?
I'm Dusty Crophopper.

386
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,039
Dusty Crophopper? Dusty Crophopper!

387
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,279
Go, go, go, go, go!

388
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,879
- The air racer?
- Uh, hi.

389
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,679
Shut the hangar door!

390
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,879
I'm your biggest fan!

391
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,919
I have seen every single
one of your races on RSN.

392
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,079
Wow!

393
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,439
You're smaller than I
thought, but that's okay.

394
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,559
Um, thanks.

395
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,759
So, what is a world-famous
racing superstar doing here?

396
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,959
Um... Um, well...

397
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,399
I'm here because I'm
between races right now,

398
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,079
so I'm helping out some friends...

399
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,279
- Oh, that's so sweet!
- Back home.

400
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,559
I'm Dipper. That's what
everyone calls me,

401
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,039
so you can, too.

402
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,239
- Okay, Mrs...
- "Miss."

403
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,599
- Miss.
- Miss, yeah.

404
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,559
- Dipper. Yep.
- Dipper. Yep.

405
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,471
Rarr!

406
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,439
It was great to meet you.

407
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,439
I'm looking for Blade Ranger.

408
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,879
He's out scouting for spot fires.
He should be back in a few.

409
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,919
Thanks.

410
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,599
The one the Lakota call Haokah

411
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,719
beats his drum with the
wind to make thunder.

412
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:35,670
With thunder comes lightning,
and with lightning comes fire.

413
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,759
Okay.

414
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,279
Yeah, very nice.

415
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,599
Windlifter, stop scaring our guest.

416
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,799
I don't hear any drums.

417
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,347
Kilawu.

418
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,119
All aircraft, we've got
a report of a wildfire.

419
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,119
Come on, boys, let's load up!

420
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,509
Patch, drop the needle!

421
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,919
It's an actual fire?

422
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,799
Yeah. It happens all the time.

423
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,984
You guys only hear
about the big ones.

424
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,799
Fire is due to an
unattended campfire.

425
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,959
Location, 10 clicks northwest,
heading two-niner-seven.

426
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,999
Slow rate of spread.

427
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,946
Ten acres with a
northerly wind on it.

428
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,029
I gotta see this.

429
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,990
Thar she burns, fellas!

430
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,225
Whoa!

431
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,879
All right, mud droppers,
watch your altitude.

432
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,599
Too low, and you'll
spread the embers.

433
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,039
Dipper, set up for a drop
and vee the head of the fire.

434
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,383
Copy that. I'm away.

435
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,119
Windlifter, you're clear to maneuver.

436
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,588
Windlifter copies.

437
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,599
All right, Cabbie...

438
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,159
Let's get some wheels on the ground.

439
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,239
Jumpers, South Meadow looks clear.

440
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,949
Should put you approximately
100 yards below the fire.

441
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,559
Looks good, Cabbie.

442
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,079
Let's ride the silk elevator, boys.

443
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,759
I will never understand why you
gravel crunchers want to jump

445
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,759
out of a perfectly good airplane.

446
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,706
We're not. We're jumping out of you!

447
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,261
Ha!

448
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,279
Everyone's down. We're good.

449
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,759
Cabbie copies. Be careful out there.

450
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,359
Dynamite, use that creek bed

451
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,639
as a natural barrier
to create a firebreak.

452
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,959
All right, jumpers,
let's anchor into the bed

453
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,781
and start building a line.

454
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,991
Awesome!

455
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,239
Who the...

456
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,119
Get out of this air space!

457
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,270
Oh, sorry. Sorry!

458
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,941
Oh-oh.

459
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,759
Ah. That ought to do it.

460
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,679
Well, back to work.

461
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,319
I gotta mix up a fresh
batch of retardant.

462
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,439
Once you dry out,
you can wing it on back

463
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,439
to the lodge with the
rest of the tourists.

464
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,159
I'm not a tourist. Actually,
I'm the guy that May...

465
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,389
He's the trainee.

466
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,839
You're the SEAT Mayday radioed about?

467
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,359
- Oh, for the love of...
- Come on, Blade.

468
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,479
He's not just some SEAT.

469
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,559
No, no, no.

470
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,039
Seriously. It's Dusty Crophopper,
the champion air racer.

472
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,679
- "Champion."
- Don't be shy. Come on!

473
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,799
Tell him!

474
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,879
No big deal.

475
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,959
He raced all the way
around the world!

476
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,061
I did. I did do that.

477
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,870
The world wasn't on
fire though, was it?

478
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,225
Was the whole world on fire?

479
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,901
No.

480
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,239
Hmm.

481
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,559
Maru!

482
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,639
What?

483
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,999
Rip off his landing gear.

484
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,079
Wait, what?

485
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,599
Muskrat, muskrat candlelight

486
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,199
It feels pretty weird
without the tip tanks.

487
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,519
Tip tanks?

488
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,239
You couldn't exactly
go flying into fire

489
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,759
with fuel tanks on your wings.

490
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,439
Kaboom!

491
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,519
Nope. You're gonna
need these pontoons.

492
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,879
- They may be old...
- Old?

493
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,599
But they'll let you scoop
water right off the lake.

494
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,359
You're goofing on me.
Do you have any new ones?

495
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,100
New?

496
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,719
We don't even know what that
word means around here.

497
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,199
I rebuilt these babies myself.

498
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,439
They're better than new.

499
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,959
- Give them a go.
- Huh?

500
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,799
All right. Let me just get this...

501
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,879
Pop the wheels, genius.

502
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,303
The whee... Yeah. Pop the wheels.

503
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,759
Oh.

504
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,599
- That's it.
- Yeah, you think?

505
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,919
Yeah, I'm tall. Look at this.

506
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,239
Hey, you guys have a wall of fame
just like the Jolly Wrenches.

508
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,479
So, what's the deal?

509
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,480
What do you have to do to
get your picture up here?

510
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,439
Crash.

511
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,639
Oh.

512
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,439
Yeah, it's dangerous work,

513
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,420
but that's the job of a firefighter.

514
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,479
Risking their lives for
people they don't even know.

515
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,301
They fly in when
others are flying out.

516
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,503
It takes a special kind of plane.

517
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,559
Fighting wildfire means flying low.

518
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,399
And that's why we
have Augerin Canyon,

519
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,759
our own little obstacle course.

520
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,399
All you gotta do is
stay below the rim,

521
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,439
and when you get to the bridge,
fly under and pull out.

523
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,519
Flying low. No problem.

524
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,031
Overconfidence, the kind of
attitude that can get you killed.

526
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,706
Okay, now, let's see you
make it under that bridge.

527
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,159
Why did you pull power?
You gotta firewall it.

528
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,959
The bridge, it's too
close to the falls.

529
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,119
No excuses.

530
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,384
If there had been a downdraft,
you'd be dead.

531
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,279
Make a normal seaplane approach.

532
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,119
Stay on the step while collecting
water through the scoops.

534
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,359
Just like that.

535
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,119
Climb out loaded, return to your
holding orbit, and drop as directed.

536
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,199
Copy that?

537
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,701
Copy that.

538
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,359
Okay, you've got 12 to
15 seconds to scoop...

539
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,999
Then 50 feet to climb out.

540
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,879
And watch out for the tree!

541
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,479
Indirect attack,
parallel attack, direct attack.

542
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,479
Know what your fire
is doing at all times.

543
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,559
Wind speed and direction.

544
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,959
Temperature, relative humidity.

545
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,039
And finally, all aircraft
must be on the ground

546
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,719
30 minutes after sunset.

547
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,639
Flying low at night
is the fastest way

548
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,585
to get your picture on the wall.

549
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,541
Too early.

550
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,901
Too high!

551
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,839
Too low.

552
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,662
Those crops of yours, they die a lot?

553
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,159
Approach looks good.

554
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,199
Now, increase your air speed.

555
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,359
Redline it.

556
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,679
Go to max torque.

557
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,759
Don't back off.

558
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,559
Don't back off!

559
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,599
Oh, why did you bail out again?

560
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,140
If you don't push it, you're not gonna
make it and you won't be certified.

561
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,279
Good job!

562
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,545
You just saved those folks
from a nice vacation.

563
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,759
Propwash Junction to Dusty.

564
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,559
Come in, Dusty.
Propwash Junction to Dusty.

565
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,639
Hey, Skipper.

566
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,919
Hey! How's it going?

567
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,559
This is tougher than I thought, but
it is so good to hear from you.

569
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,639
Well, we wanted to radio...

570
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,959
Skip, let me tell him.

571
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,119
Oh, all right, Chug.

572
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,319
- Tell me what?
- Okay.

573
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,239
That we...

574
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,319
Oh, I can't!

575
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,439
You tell him, Sparky.

576
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,559
Uh, well.

577
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,119
So, okay, there's this
fella out in California.

578
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,319
California!

579
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,879
The Skipper and I know him from back
when we were stationed in Coronado.

580
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,999
Near San Diego!

581
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,319
We all used to go down to Baja.

582
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,719
Near Coronado!

583
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,119
Oh, boy, there was this one
time we went to this bar,

584
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,999
and Skipper put a hula skirt
and coconuts on his...

585
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,079
- Sparky!
- Right, okay. Sorry. Sorry.

586
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,959
The point is, he has one of your...

587
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,999
Gearboxes!

588
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,159
We got the gearbox!

589
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,519
You got the... You got the...
Are you kidding me?

590
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,839
Oh, wait. It gets better.

591
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,759
He's going to ship it out tonight.

592
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,679
We'll have it in a couple of days!

593
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,799
This is the best news.

594
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,359
This is just what I
needed to hear right now.

595
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,999
We'll let you know as
soon as we get it.

596
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,959
Hey, Dusty! Listen to my new siren.

597
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,119
Huh?

598
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,879
Yeah, I haven't actually

599
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,382
hooked up his siren yet.

600
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,359
All aircraft, be advised...

601
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,039
Something's up. I gotta go, guys.

602
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,519
I repeat, Superintendent
Spinner has entered the base.

604
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,039
What's going on?

605
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,799
Park superintendent.

606
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,519
He waxes himself... daily.

607
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,159
Honk, honk! Beep-beep!

608
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,399
Park superintendent coming.

609
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,399
I sign your paychecks.
Anybody gonna greet me?

610
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,519
Yes, you are!

611
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,719
I got some oil pans to change.

612
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,879
Blade, Blade, Blade.

613
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,039
What do you want, Cad?

614
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,599
That's a big hill. Listen.

615
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,959
Do you think I like
driving all around

616
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,799
over here and up there,
over there just to complain?

617
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,239
Answer... No, I don't.

618
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,839
But, I heard from some campers
that one of your staff

619
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,079
just soaked them with that red fire
phosphorescent stuff that you use.

620
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,239
The deodorant.

621
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,319
Yeah, I'm sorry. That was my fault.

622
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,479
The team needs to train.

623
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,759
There's gonna be some mud
spilled along the way.

624
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,919
Are you kidding me?

625
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,679
- No, that's the way it works.
- No, you are not!

626
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,399
Blade, you're hiding a world famous
racer right here at Piston Peak!

628
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,380
Ripslinger!

629
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,439
Uh, it's "Crophopper."

630
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,519
Crophopper!

631
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,719
- Dusty.
- Yeah, right.

632
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,079
Me, Cad Spinner. You, one fast plane.

633
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,279
What are you doing up here?

634
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,439
- Well, I'm getting...
- Doesn't matter.

635
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,879
Tomorrow night. The lodge.

636
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,759
Grand reopening party.
You're invited!

637
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,999
And I'm thinking,

638
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,945
high-speed flyover.
What are you thinking?

639
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,181
I'm thinking it'll be...
It'll be dark.

640
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,199
Hey! There's gonna be a lot of VIPs.

641
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,599
"Very Important Planes."

642
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,079
How would you like
to rub tires with the

643
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,119
Secretary of the Interior of
the United States of America?

645
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,543
I smell photo op! Flash! Cha-ching.

646
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,599
I smell something else.

647
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,719
Blade, Blade, Blade.

648
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,079
Can I explain something? Yes, I can.

649
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,439
Look, spilling mud on people
makes for sad campers.

650
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,599
Big party at my lodge
makes for happy campers.

651
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,879
You understand?

652
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,879
You've packed too many
happy campers into the park

653
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,919
and way too many into that lodge.

654
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,119
Oh, we've got a structural fire
engine down there protecting it.

655
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,319
This isn't just about
protecting the lodge.

656
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,479
There's low humidity...

657
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,479
He got the Park Service to
shift 80 percent of our budget

658
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,639
to his lodge restoration project.

659
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,799
This base is held together with
baling wire and duct tape!

660
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,462
Maru had to rebuild
that old tower himself.

661
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,439
It's better than new!

662
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,199
Hear me, fellow forest friends,
dirty though you may be.

663
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,319
This is an historic weekend.

664
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,279
Cad, you got 30 seconds. Go.

665
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,319
Ah, I don't care how much it costs.

666
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,759
Yes, get the crystal glasses.

667
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,119
Yes, fluted! Were you
built in a barn? Come on!

668
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,759
The lodge is only gonna
be grand-reopened once.

669
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,591
I'm not gonna...

670
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,905
Could you hold on a second?

671
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,262
Then fire the old lady, and get
somebody who can get them!

673
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,159
You're not the only ones
who can put out a fire, right?

674
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,159
Will I see you at the party?
Yes, I will.

675
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,479
Superstar!

676
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,839
Can you believe it?
Dusty Cropslinger!

677
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,679
He's even more famous
than you, Blazin' Blade.

678
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,039
- "Blazin' Blade?"
- Shh!

679
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,159
- What?
- Shh.

680
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,199
- What, me, shush?
- Shh!

681
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,879
- I just said "Blazin' Blade."
- Kilawu!

682
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,506
What?

683
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,359
Tonight. Main hangar.

684
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,519
Tell no one.

685
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,307
Especially Blade.

686
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,227
Password.

687
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,599
Password? You didn't tell me...

688
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,159
Shh!

689
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,239
You didn't tell me a password.

690
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,186
It's "Inferno."

691
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,666
Okay.

692
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,588
Oh. Inferno.

693
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,359
Glad you could make it.

694
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,559
You like "Inferno"?

695
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,759
It was either that, or "Maelstrom,"
but that was so Nordic.

696
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,319
Park it over here, Dust Storm.

697
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,586
Our first date,
and I saved you a spot.

698
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,028
Yeah. They're real.

699
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,759
"Howard The Truck"?
You invited me here to watch...

700
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,185
Dude, dude, dude.
Judge not a video by its cover.

701
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,100
I'm Larry H. Parkinglot,
and I'll fight for you!

702
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,479
Hold on. Blade was a TV star?

703
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,359
139 episodes of law-breaking love.

704
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,861
Quiet!

705
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,719
Good move, partner.

706
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,559
Man, why you choppies
always spoiling my fun?

707
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,639
Hey, you think it's fun running station
wagons off the road, you punk?

708
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,759
If I had a nickel for
every crook like you...

709
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,799
Hey, hey, hey!

710
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,919
He ain't worth it, Nick.

711
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,149
All units, we have a code 904-S.

712
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,679
Structural fire
downtown at Studio 4x4.

713
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,399
L.A. Seven-Mary-Four,
this is Officer Nick Lopez.

714
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,479
We're on it!

715
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,319
Help!

716
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,901
Help!

717
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,311
Hoist!

718
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,999
Are you all right, miss?

719
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,119
Hey, baby.

720
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,190
Ooh, I am now.

721
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,519
Hmm.

722
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,626
As much as it pains me to
say this, you two jokers...

723
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,624
You did a good job.

724
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,999
Nice catch today, Blade.

725
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,159
Speaking of which,
she's got a sister.

726
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,359
Hi.

727
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,191
Good move, partner.

728
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,359
Dudes, let's watch episode 38,
"Super Copter"!

729
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,359
"Super Copter"? This show stinks.

730
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,319
What are you talking about?
This show is the best.

731
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,185
I'm with Cabbie.

732
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,959
- Guys? Hey, guys?
- Quiet!

733
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,279
Thanks.

734
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,639
I just don't get something.

735
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,999
If Blade was such a big TV
star, what is he doing here?

737
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,439
- I don't know.
- We don't know!

738
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,999
It's a mysterious mystery.

739
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,185
It's like my fiance.
He just vanished. Poof!

740
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,039
From my experience,
this kind of stuff is classified.

741
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,119
Black ops!

742
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,479
I heard he went cuckoo on the set.

743
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,559
You know, probably top secret.

744
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,679
CIA!

745
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,719
- I'm sure he could tell us.
- Yes!

746
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,519
- But he'd have to kill us.
- I don't want to die!

747
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,039
Whatever the reason is,

748
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,340
it's his business,
and we're not asking.

749
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,719
All aircraft and jumpers,
lightning storm came through.

750
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,519
We've got multiple starts

751
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,500
north of Skyline Drive,
east of Coil Springs.

752
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,079
Lightning storm started a whole slew
of spot fires and they've merged.

753
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,559
This is a big one.

754
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,631
Winds are out of the southwest
with a moderate rate of spread.

755
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,599
Rapid.

756
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,439
Wait. We have an update.
Rapid rate of spread.

757
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,319
Dipper, you and Windlifter load up.

758
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,079
- Champ, wait in the hangar.
- What?

759
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,079
Blade, Dusty's been
practicing so hard.

760
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,759
- This ain't no campfire.
- Come on, I can do this.

761
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,239
- You're not certified.
- Just give him a shot.

762
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,399
He's not certified!

763
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,585
We need every plane we've got.

764
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,065
I want to help.

765
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,439
Maru!

766
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,941
Yeah, Blade?

767
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,079
Load him up.

768
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,264
Okay!

769
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,866
What was that for?

770
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,991
The wall.

771
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,199
Dipper, move into position.

772
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,039
Split load. Coverage level eight.

773
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,701
Dipper copies.

774
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,279
Come left one wingspan
on your next drop.

775
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,119
Champ, tag on and extend.

776
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,304
- Split load.
- Copy that.

777
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,639
Too high!

778
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,079
It all dispersed.

779
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,799
Windlifter, finish off that ridge.

780
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,904
Windlifter copies.

781
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,159
Pull back!

782
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,788
Pull back! Let's go,
let's go right now!

783
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,839
Blade, we got a situation.

784
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,959
The wind shifted.
The fire jumped the line.

785
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,159
Can you make it to your safety zone?

786
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,503
No, no good.
Our escape route is blocked.

787
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,919
We need a drop.

788
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,759
Copy that. Dipper,
smokejumpers trapped.

789
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,159
Left flank, set up for a drop.

790
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,708
I see them. I've got it.

791
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,199
All right. We're clear.

792
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,199
Let's move. Let's get to the lake.

793
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,039
That's my Dust Muffin!

794
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,839
Champ, load and return.

795
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,519
We still got a lot of work to do.

796
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,510
Copy that.

797
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,279
Dynamite just reported in.

798
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,199
They're gonna camp out tonight
and mop it up tomorrow.

799
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,719
Cabbie, how's it looking?

800
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,479
We got that sucker boxed in.

801
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,559
Nice work!

802
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,141
That's why we're here.

803
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,239
So, that's it?

804
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,039
Yep, fire is contained.

805
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,559
The jumpers will stir
on it until it's out.

806
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,479
You did a great job out there,
sweet SEAT.

807
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,079
Thanks. I saw the
jumpers in trouble...

808
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,239
You broke formation
in a crowded airspace.

809
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,519
Could've been you spread all over
the woods instead of retardant.

810
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,079
Don't go planning your
certification party yet, Champ.

811
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,239
Oh, man.

812
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,028
Come on, that's just Blade's
way of saying "Good job."

813
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,909
Whoa. That was low.

814
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,519
Cad's VIPs.

815
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,759
Oh, yeah, that's right.

816
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,159
He's having a big party
up at the lodge tonight.

817
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,439
We should go!

818
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,919
A second date? Wow! Room!

819
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,719
Uh, I kind of meant all of us.

820
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,919
You know, you and me,
and Windlifter, and just everybody.

821
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,759
Oh! Okay.

822
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,279
Okay, okay, yeah. Mmm-hmm.

823
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,439
You're right, you're right.

824
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,704
I should get to know your friends.

825
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,559
But they're your friends.

826
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,039
Well, yeah, I guess. Yeah.

827
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,780
Let's not bicker.

828
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,119
Welcome to the Fusel Lodge.

829
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,639
Be sure to get your complimentary
bumper sticker over at the Gift Garage.

830
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,839
Whoa! Look at this place.

831
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,719
It's so beautiful.

832
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,159
Dusty-poo, this is the perfect date!

833
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,999
Let's check it out
before we check in.

834
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,359
- Hey, there, folks.
- Hi.

835
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,227
Like to get your picture taken
with the superintendent?

836
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,599
- Uh...
- Ha!

837
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,039
Classy.

838
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,639
Oui, you're all set with the
Piston view deluxe honeymoon suite

840
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,279
on our zero-emission floor.

841
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,399
Enjoy your stay.

842
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,479
Wow.

843
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,599
They do weddings here.
Did you know that?

844
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,199
Oh, this is so exciting,
I'm gonna overheat!

845
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,359
Well, I'm hitting the spa.

846
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,759
The high beam steam takes
off 50,000 miles, easy.

847
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,199
Welcome, Mr. Secretary,

848
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,199
to the grand reopening weekend
of the magnificent...

849
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,799
It's a pleasure to be here, Spinner.

850
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,519
And is it a pleasure to
see you, sir? Yes, it is.

851
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,399
So, now, what's this
I hear about a fire?

852
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,519
Uh, fire...

853
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,159
The Whitewall Fire is contained, sir.

854
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,319
- Right.
- It's under control.

855
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,359
It's absolutely under control.

856
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,559
- Thank you...
- Engine Pulaski, sir.

857
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,639
- Who-ski?
- "Pulaski."

858
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,999
Right. Anyway, right this way, sir.

859
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,519
And if there's any other
questions you have for me,

860
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,239
please, I am your man.

861
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,199
Don't even have normal coffee here.

862
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,199
I had to get something
called a "Highway Expresso."

863
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,439
What do you think?

864
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,544
- You look good.
- Eh.

865
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,279
Tell me, how's the park's
indigenous wildlife population?

866
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,879
- The what?
- The wildlife.

867
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,079
Oh, the wildlife!

868
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,439
Well, if you come to the party tonight,
there'll be plenty of party animals.

869
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,319
Ho, ho, ho. Huh?

870
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,719
I see. Yes.

871
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,199
The deer population is steady.

872
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,639
And we've had a healthy increase

873
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,599
in the number of
red-propped balsa thrush.

874
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,159
Ah, glad to hear it. Say,
I didn't quite catch your name.

875
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,559
Ranger Jammer, sir.

876
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,319
Seventy-two years at Piston Peak.

877
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,039
- Pleased to meet you, Jammer.
- Well, it's a true...

878
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,599
Bumper kisser.

879
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,399
Wow, look at that ice sculpture!

880
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,399
This could be our room if we
were little, tiny pieces of ice.

881
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,981
Dusty Crophopper!

882
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,759
My buddies are never
gonna believe this.

883
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,079
Hey, do my voice-mail.

884
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,399
- Your voice-mail?
- Go!

885
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,559
Oh, hi, this is Dusty Crophopper.

886
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,559
- "World racing champion."
- World racing champion.

887
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,319
Please leave a message at the beep.

888
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,439
- Now, beep.
- What?

889
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,639
- Do it!
- Beep!

890
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,380
That was awesome!

891
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,439
Move along.

892
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,959
Dusty! You have to meet the
Secretary of the Interior.

893
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,399
- Okay.
- I'm up for a promotion.

894
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,799
You understand.
You're upwardly mobile, right?

895
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,559
- Sure.
- Of course, you are. You're a plane.

896
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,999
Hey! Boat Reynolds!

897
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,519
Boat, loved you in Best
Little Boathouse in Texas.

898
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,599
Excuse me, son. Do you work here?

899
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,799
No, not really.

900
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,159
Great, come over here.

901
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,759
It's our anniversary.

902
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,119
- We honeymooned here 50 years ago.
- Can you believe it?

903
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,439
I was 50 years younger
and half a ton lighter.

904
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,519
More to love!

905
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,799
And Harvey, bless his heart,

906
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,119
is trying to find the spot
where we had our first kiss.

907
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,479
Oh, that is so sweet!

908
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,999
You don't do things
like that anymore.

909
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,519
Honey, honey, listen,
I'm telling you.

910
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:01,708
There was a bridge, and a
magnificent waterfall, and...

911
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,506
You.

912
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,182
I love you, Harvey.

913
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,719
Hey, you know,
that sounds like Augerin Canyon.

914
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,159
Yeah, that's right! Anger Canyon.

915
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,479
By Upper Whitewall Falls.

916
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,799
By Whitewash Falls!

917
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,399
See? I told you I knew where it was.

918
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,519
Hey, in honor of your anniversary,
why don't you join us?

920
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,999
We'll buy you a can of oil, on me.

921
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,309
Oh, thank you, dear.

922
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,479
Oh, sure, sure.

923
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,159
I've been around
the block a few times.

924
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,479
I worked as a taco truck, sold
carwash curtain rings for a while.

926
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,839
Then, I got into RV tire sales.

927
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,639
Winnie here was my showroom model.

928
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,479
That's how we met.

929
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,639
- It's true.
- Aw, nice.

930
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,639
For our wedding day, bought her
the best set of whitewalls.

931
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,319
We wore off the treads
on our honeymoon.

932
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,159
Yeah, oh...

933
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,319
- Driving!
- Oh, driving! Of course!

934
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,479
She said "Driving."

935
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,999
- Delete that thought.
- Deleted!

936
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,039
You know, Dusty...

937
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,839
Maybe this firefighting thing
will be a second career for you.

938
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,159
Oh, yeah. This is a second
career for all of us.

939
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,679
Windlifter was a lumberjack,
Cabbie was in the military,

940
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,359
and me, well, I hauled
cargo up in Anchorage.

941
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,599
Yeah, a lot of guys up in Anchorage.

942
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,359
I was beating them off with a stick.

943
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,879
"Come here, boy. No." Boom!

944
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,239
Hey, big whirlybird,
you haven't said much.

945
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,759
How about a toast?

946
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,039
Uh, Windlifter's not really
much for speeches.

947
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,904
A toast to Coyote.

948
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,359
It was he who drove
all day and all night

949
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,879
to the base of Bright Mountain.

950
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,359
With much difficulty, he climbed
the mountain to obtain fire,

952
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,359
and brought it down
to the first vehicles.

953
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,279
But in so doing, he burned his tires.

954
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,879
And when Coyote saw
his blackened tires,

955
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,039
he thought they were his
favorite snack, and he ate them!

957
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,639
For he knew they
were still full of life.

958
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:55,399
And it was in this way,
he let go of the old,

959
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:01,304
and renewed himself like
fire renews the earth.

960
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,919
Uh, I'm just gonna say it.

961
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,199
You had me up until the part
where he eats his own tires.

962
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,919
Best toast ever, Wind.

963
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,079
Cheers!

964
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,991
Cheers!

965
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,639
Propwash Junction to Dusty.

966
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,679
Oh? Huh? Oh? Oh, oh.

967
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,319
Come in, Dusty. Come in, Dusty.

968
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,279
Propwash Junction to Dusty.

969
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,679
Hey, Skip.

970
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,839
Oh.

971
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,359
What's up?

972
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,101
Oh, did the gearbox come in?

973
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,511
Well, we...

974
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,279
What?

975
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,599
So...

976
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,959
Dust...

977
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,509
Sparky, I'll tell him.

978
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,543
It was the wrong one.

979
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:57,631
The crate... it was mislabeled.

980
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,559
We've called every parts
supplier, repair shop,

981
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,791
and junkyard in the country.

982
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,827
Nobody has your gearbox.

983
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,460
Dusty?

984
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,381
I'm here.

985
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,071
I'm sorry.

986
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,505
I gotta go.

987
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,345
Thanks.

988
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,066
All aircraft, we've got two fires.

989
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,839
Hey, Crophopper.

990
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,719
Get this, Cad's fancy jet VIPs

991
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,359
flew in too low over the
burn area last night,

992
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,067
blew embers in all directions.

993
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,359
Champ,

994
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,430
let's load and go.

995
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,879
The fire broke containment
and split in two.

996
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,359
Windlifter, you and Dipper
take the Coil Springs fire.

997
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,399
Me and the SEAT will
take Whitewall Rapids.

998
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,709
Windlifter copies.

999
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,799
- Maru, come in.
- Yeah, Blade?

1000
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,239
- It's worse than we thought.
- Yeah?

1001
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,599
Get on the horn to the lodge.

1002
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,719
That fire is about four hours
from their front door.

1003
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,039
They're gonna have to evacuate.

1004
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,399
Absolutely not!

1005
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,799
Blade insists.

1006
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,039
To be safe, you gotta
get everyone out.

1007
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,839
I've been working on this
lodge for five years.

1008
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,239
I'm not gonna evacuate
now just to be "safe."

1009
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,239
You got less than four hours.

1010
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,439
Why am I talking to you?

1011
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,559
Where's Blade?

1012
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,479
Oh, he's out back
sipping a motorjito.

1013
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,999
Where do you think he is?

1014
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,879
He's out fighting the fire!

1015
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,279
If we're gonna save the lodge,

1016
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,239
we've gotta keep this fire
from cresting the ridge.

1017
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,319
I'll drop, then you
tag on and extend.

1018
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,319
And make it a split load.

1019
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,119
That way, we can double up and
widen it downwind of the ridge...

1020
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,279
If you push yourself into
the red, you'll crash.

1021
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,079
Nobody has your gearbox.

1022
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,741
Copy that?

1023
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,399
- Hey! You copy that?
- Huh?

1024
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,028
Yeah. Yes. Copy that.

1025
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,310
You gotta be kidding me.

1026
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,079
- Was that your whole tank?
- Yeah.

1027
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,279
You just wasted all of it.

1028
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,519
I was just following your orders.

1029
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,759
I said, "Split load."

1030
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,439
We were going to make a secondary
line to protect that lodge.

1031
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,679
It'll be fine. I can
reload at the lake.

1032
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,159
Negative! Return to base.

1033
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,799
No! There's no time.
Let's just get this fire out.

1034
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,359
Hey, hey! You need to listen to me!

1035
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,305
I'll be fine!

1036
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,799
These crosswinds are too strong.
Return to base!

1037
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,279
This is what you trained me to do!

1038
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,799
Not under these conditions.

1039
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,839
If we're gonna get this fire out,
I've gotta reload.

1040
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,661
- Pull up, that's an order!
- No, I can do this.

1041
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,150
Oh! Ah!

1042
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,359
I've taken in too much water.

1043
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,431
- My engine stalled.
- Stalled?

1044
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,479
Keep your pontoons downstream.
I'll keep ahead of you.

1045
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,559
I'll get out on my own.

1046
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,679
How you planning on doing that?

1047
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,386
I'll restart my engine.

1048
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,027
Just hang on.
I'm gonna pull you to shore.

1049
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,341
Got it!

1050
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,901
Ah!

1051
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,519
Ah. Ah!

1052
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,599
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

1053
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,679
There's too much coverage.

1054
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,079
Don't worry, I'll get you
at the next clearing.

1055
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,581
Right.

1056
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,021
The hoist, it's caught.

1057
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,941
- Uh!
- Blade...

1058
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,119
Blade!

1059
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,559
Oh, come on.

1060
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,879
You need to start your engine.

1061
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,621
You've got clear water.
You can take off before the falls.

1062
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,950
It's your only chance.

1063
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,119
Right! Right.

1064
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,239
Got it. I'm good!

1065
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,787
Now, redline it.

1066
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,386
Push your engine!

1067
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,661
Redline it!

1068
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,039
You need more lift!

1069
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,190
Redline it! Redline it!

1070
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,182
Why are you holding back? Redline it!

1071
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,622
Ah! Oh!

1072
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,799
Why didn't you redline it?

1073
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,349
You could've made it!
What were you thinking?

1074
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,948
What? What's wrong?

1075
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,519
This ain't good.

1076
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,671
Head down that path. Follow me.

1077
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,585
Champ, come on!

1078
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,039
In here.

1079
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,319
An old mine? We can't go in there.

1080
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,639
We'll suffocate!

1081
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,239
It's our only chance.
We'll let it burn over.

1082
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,439
No, you go on. I'll keep moving.

1083
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,227
What are you doing? Hey. Hey!

1084
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,719
You can't outrun the fire.

1085
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,359
You know what? I'll find my way out.

1086
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,199
Like you found your
way out of the rapids.

1087
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,239
I didn't want to push my engine.

1088
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,039
- You didn't "want" to?
- Blade, listen to me.

1089
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,599
This isn't about you.
This is about life and death.

1090
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,959
You need to follow orders.

1091
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,079
I told you, "Split load,"
you dropped it all.

1092
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,639
I told you not to reload on
the lake, you did it anyway.

1093
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,439
I told you, "Redline it,"
you pulled power.

1094
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,839
You don't have what it takes!
You don't!

1095
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,759
Fine! I never wanted to
be a firefighter anyway!

1096
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,466
Then go back to racing!

1097
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,279
Go win yourself another
trophy, Champ.

1098
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,639
I can't!

1099
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,839
My gearbox is busted! All right?

1100
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,439
That's why I pulled power.

1101
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,466
I'm never gonna...

1102
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,119
Life doesn't always go
the way you expect it.

1103
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,999
But you came here to
become a firefighter.

1104
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,799
If you give up today,

1105
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,782
think of all the lives
you won't save tomorrow.

1106
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,468
So, what are you going to do?

1107
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,479
Is it a beautiful day
here at Piston Peak Park?

1108
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,879
Yes, it is!

1109
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,999
Thanks for coming out, everybody.

1110
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,639
And I'd like to give
a special welcome

1111
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,239
to the Secretary of the Interior

1112
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,279
who is joining us for the unveiling
of this commemorative...

1113
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,519
Plaque.

1114
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,306
The safety of the
tourists is at stake!

1115
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,599
Sorry about that.

1116
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,785
If you could excuse me for a moment,
ladies and gentlemen. Thank you.

1117
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,279
Am I giving a speech?

1118
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,599
Yes, I am, Pnewski.

1119
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,719
- No, sir, "Pulaski."
- Papooski.

1120
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,839
- "Pulaski."
- P'tootsie.

1121
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,580
"Pulaski."

1122
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,239
That's what I said.
We're saying the same thing.

1123
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,239
With all due respect,
Superintendent Spinner,

1124
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,959
the smoke over the ridge
is growing closer.

1125
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,279
Yeah, perhaps we should
turn on the roof sprinklers?

1126
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,559
We must evacuate.

1127
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,239
Better listen to them, Cad.
They're right.

1128
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,679
Come on, Spinner!
Let's see that plaque.

1129
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,759
Right away, sir!

1130
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,999
We need to cancel the unveiling.

1131
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,399
The longer we wait,
the worse it'll get.

1132
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,319
Who are you?

1133
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,519
You're a glorified bell boy.

1134
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,759
You're an overpriced sprinkler,

1135
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,959
and you're old, and you
have a dumb hat on.

1136
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,599
Who am I? I'm the Superintendent,
and today is about me and my lodge.

1137
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,307
And now is the moment
I've been waiting for!

1138
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,159
Now, that's just rude.

1139
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,946
- Fire!
- Oh.

1140
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,070
Let's get out of here.

1141
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,999
Quickly! Quickly. We must evacuate.

1142
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,079
Don't panic! We must evacuate!

1143
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,399
This is a mandatory evacuation,
but we have plenty of time.

1145
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,839
Keep moving.

1146
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,079
Keep going at a steady pace.

1147
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,999
Keep moving slowly, but carefully.

1148
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,479
All right. Look,
there's no need to panic.

1149
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,799
It's really just a small,
little fire.

1150
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,759
If you all just calm down,
you can come back next year.

1151
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,479
Sure, you can all
come back next year.

1152
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,550
I'll see you right here!

1153
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,749
Move along. That's it.

1154
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,239
And remember, avoid the smoke,
stay above the canyon walls,

1155
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,479
you'll be okay.

1156
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,879
All right, next, please.

1157
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,879
Out of my way, tail dragger.

1158
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,399
Hold on, there, big fella.
No cutsies.

1159
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,231
You don't want to
upset my buddy, here.

1160
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,559
All right, ma'am,
you're clear for takeoff.

1161
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,679
Thank you!

1162
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,319
Remember to avoid the smoke

1163
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,599
and stay above the canyon walls!

1164
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:05,239
Move along. Quickly, please.

1165
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,879
I'm sorry. I am sorry. That is all.

1166
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,359
The train is full.

1167
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,519
Remaining guests,
please follow a staff member.

1168
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,439
They will lead you to
the main road exit.

1169
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,959
All aboard!

1170
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,239
Blade...

1171
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,947
Airway Meadow should be clear.

1172
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,439
We'll take off from there.

1173
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,271
Let's go.

1174
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,750
Blade!

1175
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,159
Blade!

1176
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,679
Patch, come in,
this is Crophopper Seven.

1177
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,079
Patch, come in!

1178
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,599
I read you, Crophopper Seven.

1179
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,039
Blade is down.
I repeat, Blade is down!

1180
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,999
I'll send Windlifter to respond.

1181
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,831
Stay at your location.

1182
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,159
Okay, that's good. Slow, slow.

1183
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,741
Good, good.

1184
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,879
Careful!

1185
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,319
Good. We're good!

1186
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,839
Pinecone, get those straps off.

1187
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:39,959
- Avalanche?
- Yes!

1188
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,906
Push the ramp alongside the
access panel and be careful.

1189
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,239
He'll be okay, right?

1190
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,319
It's bad, but, Maru,
he's the best there is.

1191
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,106
He'll make him better than new.

1192
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,879
His hydraulics are completely fried.

1193
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,039
He's losing fluids.

1194
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,599
I gotta get him back
to the garage, stat.

1195
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,079
Dynamite, tow hook!

1196
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,279
Coming right up.

1197
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,719
I'm gonna need hydraulic
fluid from the shed.

1198
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:00,799
Copy that.

1199
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,759
- Blackout, we'll need another generator.
- I got it!

1200
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,839
Try the main hangar.

1201
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,239
- And grab another heat lamp!
- Yes, boss!

1202
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:08,479
The surface burns are bad, but the
interior damage is repairable.

1204
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,142
As long as we move quick,
we got a good chance.

1205
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,506
How is he?

1206
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,959
He's resting now.

1207
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,359
Oh.

1208
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,624
I've done everything I can.

1209
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,199
Do you think he's gonna be...

1210
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:35,146
Look, Dusty, don't blame yourself.

1211
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,119
He should have left me out there.

1212
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,519
Nah.

1213
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,909
That ain't Blade's style.

1214
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,319
Especially since what
happened to Nick.

1215
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,399
Nick?

1216
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,029
You mean Nick Loopin'
Lopez from the TV show?

1217
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,359
It was just a routine day on the set.

1218
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,159
And Nick, he was doing

1219
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,879
his trademark loop for a stunt scene.

1220
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,860
But there was this freak crosswind.

1221
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,581
Blade was the first
one on the scene...

1222
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,319
But he didn't know what to do.

1223
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,479
His best friend was gone.

1224
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,519
And Blade thought
his life was over, too.

1225
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,385
But he didn't give up.

1226
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:24,225
He got trained, got certified,
and came here.

1227
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:29,190
Blade, he used to
pretend to save lives.

1228
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,501
Now, he saves them for real.

1229
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,719
What's going on up there?

1230
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,239
We're not getting enough water.

1231
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,519
Hey! We're not getting
enough water on the lodge.

1232
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,999
Reroute the main water
line to the roof sprinklers.

1233
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,279
Oh. No, no, no!

1234
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,959
The firefighters need that
water to make retardant.

1235
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,679
- How do you know that?
- I'm the concierge.

1236
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:47,959
It's my job to know everything.

1237
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,119
I don't care!

1238
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,999
Do you work for them? No,
you work for me, what's-your-name.

1239
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,344
Now, are you gonna do it,
or do I have to do it myself?

1240
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,079
Come on, come on!

1241
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,181
I got it!

1242
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,559
All right, everybody, stay calm.

1243
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,759
Both roads are open.

1244
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:18,719
Keep your headlights on low-beam
and stay under five miles an hour.

1246
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:19,799
And be careful!

1247
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,319
That's right.

1248
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,559
It's going to be fine.

1249
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,759
Keep moving.
We're gonna get everybody out.

1250
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,759
Good gracious!

1251
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,941
Watch out!

1252
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:52,959
Pulaski, you hurt?

1253
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,039
Are you okay?

1254
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,559
No, sir. Pump's busted.

1255
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,839
We're gonna have to
find another way out.

1256
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,919
That's the problem, Mr. Secretary.

1257
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,439
There is no other way out.

1258
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,719
Listen up, y'all, we got big trouble.

1259
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,959
Wildfire jumped the main exit
road and now it's blocked.

1260
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,199
I know it's after sunset,
but you're in command.

1261
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,559
It's your call.

1262
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,639
There's not much time.

1263
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,239
If you're gonna go,
you better go now.

1264
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,902
And we'll need every plane we've got.

1265
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,826
Load up.

1266
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,828
We'll have you out of here in 60...

1267
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,711
Huh? Uh...

1268
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,959
Problem! There's no water pressure.

1269
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,519
Main line must have burst again.

1270
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,719
Hey, Patch,
what's the lake look like?

1271
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,879
Negative. No visibility.

1272
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,359
Boxed in by fire and smoke.

1273
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:55,239
All we have left is
what's in our tanks.

1274
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,788
Let's make it count.

1275
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,679
We're headed straight into the fire.

1276
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:15,839
Aren't we gonna fly around it?

1277
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,159
The fastest way to the main
road is through the fire.

1278
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,071
Brace yourselves.

1279
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,660
Hold on, Dusty!

1280
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,065
Let's clear this road.

1281
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,479
All right, now, be careful.

1282
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,119
Slow and steady.

1283
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:21,067
We don't want to see any
fender benders around here.

1284
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,039
Windlifter, do you copy?

1285
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,199
Go ahead, Patch.

1286
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,239
We've got two old RVs
trapped in Augerin Canyon.

1287
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,266
Two old RVs? Oh, no.

1288
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,679
It's Harvey and Winnie.

1289
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:37,759
We met them earlier.

1290
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,599
They're looking for the place
they had their first kiss.

1291
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,919
Augerin Canyon. That's at
the other end of the park.

1292
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,279
I can get there the fastest.

1293
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,359
The canyon will be engulfed in
flames and you have no retardant.

1295
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,439
I'll scoop off the river.

1296
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,669
There's a clear stretch of water.

1297
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,869
Windlifter, I can do it.

1298
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,740
Go. And be safe.

1299
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:18,462
Help!

1300
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,386
- Help.
- Help!

1301
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,079
Winnie, hang on!

1302
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,102
- Harvey, Harvey, don't let go!
- Hold on, it'll be okay.

1303
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,501
Dusty.

1304
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,985
Good move, partner.

1305
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,786
Maru?

1306
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:24,311
Hello, there. Ha-ha!

1307
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,799
He's awake!

1308
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,870
I'm a genius.

1309
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,879
Morning, mud dropper.

1310
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:31,199
How long have I been out?

1311
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,319
Five days.

1312
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,300
Dipper stayed by your
side the whole time.

1313
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:40,630
I like watching you sleep.

1314
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,559
- He's alive!
- Looking good, Dusty.

1315
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,399
All aircraft, the superintendent
has entered the base.

1317
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,479
The superintendent has
entered the base.

1318
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,679
Well, you had us worried, Dusty.

1319
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,639
Glad to see you're out and about.

1320
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,871
You're the superinten...
What happened to Cad?

1321
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,719
Sprinkler saved the lodge,
but not his job.

1322
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,719
Secretary of the Interior
did the right thing.

1323
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,479
Put Ranger Jammer, here, in charge.

1324
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:02,599
Yay!

1325
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,959
Maru, did you tell him?

1326
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,879
Uh...

1327
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,223
Tell me what?

1328
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,744
I replaced your prop.

1329
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,319
Repaired the damaged wing ribs.

1330
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,663
Hammered out what damage I could.

1331
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,231
Even got your pontoons back on.

1332
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,349
But your gearbox...

1333
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:29,270
I know. Thanks for trying, Maru.

1334
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,519
You're welcome!

1335
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:32,159
- What?
- Because you're fixed!

1336
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,319
Wait. Really?

1337
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,799
Yeah, that was the hardest
thing I've ever done.

1338
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,999
You've got yourself a custom-made

1339
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,999
epicyclic, concentric
reduction gearbox.

1340
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,679
A new gearbox?

1341
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:45,439
No. It's better than new.

1342
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:48,559
Crophopper, I'd say you've
earned that certification.

1343
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,519
In accordance with CFR
title 14, volume three,

1344
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:57,399
chapter one, section 139,
sub-paragraph B,

1345
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,879
Propwash Junction is recertified
and open for operation.

1347
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:03,239
Go, Dusty!

1348
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,399
Hey, Dusty, I won, I won!

1349
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,239
Duster, guess what.

1350
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:10,319
I've been crowned
official Corn Colonel.

1351
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,919
And I'm his Private Niblet.

1352
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:14,119
Can I wear my official hat
to your race next Saturday?

1353
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,279
Absolutely, Chug.

1354
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,079
As long as the boss, here,
will give me the day off.

1355
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,559
Anytime.

1356
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,759
Okay, Niblet,
time to hit the festival!

1357
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:22,639
Sir, yes, sir.

1358
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,959
Hey, you think the deep fried
corn cob on a stick guy...

1359
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,159
Aw, Dusty, we're all so proud of you.

1360
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,319
Thanks, Mayday.

1361
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:32,039
What you did for me, for all
of us, I want to thank you.

1363
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,319
- You don't have to thank me.
- Yes, I do.

1364
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,060
To do what you did,

1365
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:40,545
it takes a special kind of plane.

1366
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:49,039
Ladies and gentleplanes, turn
your attention to the skies

1368
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,839
for today's featured
aerial presentation.

1369
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,519
The Propwash Junction Corn
Fest is proud to present

1370
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,919
the Piston Peak AirAttack team

1371
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,199
and our very own world champion racer

1372
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,701
and firefighter,

1373
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,999
Dusty Crophopper.

1374
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,830
Whoa. Huh?

1375
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:32,759
Welcome to Death
Valley National Park.

1376
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,479
Is it hot?

1377
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:38,187
Yes, it is.

1378
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,039
Let's keep up the pace!

1379
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:24,039
Avalanche, Blackout,
move, move, move!

1380
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,159
Did you guys see that?

1381
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:27,469
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Yay!
