<i>Ni odnoho vyzdoha! Gdye vashy?</i>

3
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:57,992
I'm alone.

4
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,078
Aren't we all?

5
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,587
- You're late, 007.
- I had to stop in the bathroom.

6
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,761
- Ready to save the world again?
- After you, 006.

7
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:22,184
- James... For England.
- For England, Alec.

8
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,797

00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,253
(Click)

10
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:10,061
- It's too easy.
- Half of everything is luck, James.

11
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,904
And the other half?

12
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,732
(alarm)

13
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,692
Fate.

14
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,529
- Set timers: six minutes.
- Six minutes. Check.

15
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,771
Fire!

16
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:55,447
- Closing time, James! Last call!
- Buy me a pint.

17
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,710
This is Colonel Ourumov!
Come out with your hands up!

18
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,594
How original.

19
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,975
Shut the door, Alec! There's a draught!

20
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,268
Alec?

21
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:45,907
Move out. Throw down your weapon
and walk towards me, slowly.

22
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,835
- Finish the job, James! Blow them to hell!
- You have ten seconds.

23
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,463
Ten.

24
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,924
nine, eight,

25
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,053
seven, six,

26
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,515
five, four,

27
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,268
- three, two...
- For England, James!

28
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,516
Hold your fire! You'll blow the gas tanks!

29
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,480
This is your last chance!
Come out with your hands...

30
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,323
Wait!

31
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,157
You can't win.

32
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,473
(Ourumov) Get out there! Move! Move it!

33
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,276
Hold your fire!

34
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,110
Wait!

<i>GoIdenE ye</i>

65
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:46,039
- James, is it necessary to drive so fast?
- More often than you'd think.

66
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,973
I enjoy a spirited ride
as much as the next girl, but...

67
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,684
- Who's that?
- The next girl.

68
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,827
(Bond sounds horn)

69
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,842
(woman sounds horn)

70
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,375
James, stop this! Stop it!

71
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,716
- I know what you're doing.
- What's that, dear?

72
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,003
You are just trying to show off
the size of your...

73
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,259
- Engine?
- Ego.

74
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,135
We're having a pleasant drive
and you bring psychology into it.

75
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:30,605
- I was just sent here to evaluate you.
- Let's put that behind us, shall we?

76
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,143
Ladies first.

77
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,993
James, I want you to stop this car!

78
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,662
- Really?
- Stop this car at once!

79
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,335
(tyres screech)

80
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:40,084
As you can see, I have no problem
with female authority.

81
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,884
Huh!

82
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,476
James, you're incorrigible.

83
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,429
What am I going to do with you?

84
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,937
Let's toast your evaluation, shall we?

85
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,441
(Bond) A very thorough evaluation.

86
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,026
(woman giggles)

87
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,304
<i>Bonsoir, Monsieur Bond.
Trés heureux de vous revoir.</i>

00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:34,638

00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,884
Monsieur.

93
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,103
Bets, ladies and gentlemen?

94
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,723
- No players?
- (Bond) Banco.

95
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,790
It appears we share the same passions.

96
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,700
Three, anyway.

97
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:42,289
I count two - motoring and... baccarat.

98
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,296
<i>(croupier) Huit, pour la banque.</i>

99
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,131
(croupier) Seven. Madame wins.

100
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:55,143
I hope the third
is where your real talent lies.

101
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,138
One rises to meet a challenge.

102
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,854
Double.

103
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,981
<i>Suivez.</i>

104

105
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,723
(croupier) Madame stands with five.

106
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,233
- Six. Madame loses.
- Buliatchl

107
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,865
- Enjoy it... while it lasts.
- The very words I live by.

108
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,198
And what words do you live by?

109
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:04,413
- The trick is to quit while you're ahead.
- That's one trick I've never learned.

110
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,748
Perhaps you'll show me how it's done.

111
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,547
Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred.

112
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,804
And for you?

113
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,055
The same.

114
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,225
How do you take it?

115
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,432
Straight up, with a twist.

116
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,148
Thank you, Mr...

117
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,353
The name's Bond. James Bond.

118
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,859
Xenia Zaragevna Onatopp.

119
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,068
_ Qnatopp?
- OnatOPP-

120
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:40,073
- Your accent... Georgian?
- Mm! Very good, Mr Bond.

121
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,621
- You've been to Russia.
- Not recently.

122
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,421
I used to drop in occasionally.
Shoot in and out.

123
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:50,675
It's very different now.
A land of opportunity.

124
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,170
With a new Ferrari in every garage?

125
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,552
No, not quite. That belongs to a friend.

126
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:03,604
A tip for your friend: the French number
plates for this year's model start with "L".

127
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,315
Even the counterfeit ones.

128
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:13,615
Oh. And what rank do you hold with
the motor vehicles department, Mr Bond?

129
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,282
Commander.

130
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,614
Shall we go?

131
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:20,701
This one is an admiral.

132
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,283
I like a woman who enjoys pulling rank.

133
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,835
Nice to meet you, Mr Bond.

134
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:30,002
The pleasure, I'm sure, was all mine.

135
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,946

please take your <i>seats</i>

What you are about to see is Europe's
answer to the electronic battleﬁeld:

160
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:29,130
the first working prototype
of the Tiger helicopter.

161
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:32,968
Uniquely manoeuvrable, the Tiger
not only uses Stealth technology,

162
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:37,354
it is hardened against all forms
of electronic interference,

163
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,103
radio jamming
and electromagnetic radiation.

Shh. I have a small surprise from
your friends back at the barracks.

00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,859
Bods

178
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,903
- Boris!
- What?

179
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,700
I thought I'd post it
on the Internet, no?

180
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:06,166
- What's the password?
- I made it easy this time.

181
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,624
Even you should be able to break it,
borscht-for-brains.

182
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:14,136
All right. All right. I'll give you a hint.

183
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:19,805
They're right in front of you
and can open very large doors.

184
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,428
You're such a geek.

185
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:26,106
- (bleeping)
- Yes! I'm in.

186
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,074
You've hacked into
the US Department of Justice.

187
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,243
What if they trace it here?

188
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:42,198
The chief of computers will call me
a genius, move me to Moscow

189
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,785
and give me a million bucks
hard currency.

190
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,875
I think not.

191
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:53,084
Besides, the Americans are slug-heads.
They'll never detect me.

192
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:57,221
You were saying, slug-head?

193
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,175
Nobody screws with Boris Grishenko.

194
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:05,225
<i>-</i> Spiked them!
- Come on, Boris. Just hang up.

195
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,148
No way! I spiked them.

196
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:14,730
- All right. What's the password?
- I'm not going to tell you.

197
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,692
OK. Let me guess.

198
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:20,452
- It's not in front of me?
- Mm-mm.

199
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,077
You sit on it,
but you can't take it with you.

200
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:32,498
My program seizes the phone line
of whoever's tracing me

201
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:35,926
and jams their modem
so they can't hang up.

202
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,839
Now the hunted becomes the hunter.

203
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:46,311
"Better luck next time,

204
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,313
slug-heads

205
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,727
Bang! Gone! I am invincible!

206
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,951
Was it good for you, too?

207
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,620
I'm getting some coffee.

208
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,618
I'm going for a cigarette.

209
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,838
(helicopter)

210
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:14,642
General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov,
head of Space Division.

211
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,323
- General, if I'd known...
- You'd have been ready.

212
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:33,627
This is an unscheduled test
of Severnaya, Major. War simulation.

213
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,130
We are going to test-ﬁre GoldenEye.
Report your status.

214
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:42,921
Two operational satellites, sir, Petya and
Mischa, in 90-minute earth orbit at 100km.

215
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,630
Good.

216
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,803
Here is the authorisation code.

217
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:51,929
Now, the GoldenEye and today's access
numbers for satellite Petya, please.

218
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:54,185
lam timing you.

219
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,889
Good. Thank you, Major.

220
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,199
(moans with pleasure)

221
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,212
On my count.

222
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,640
Three... two... one...

223
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,443
Set target. Severnaya.

224
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,161
Arm the weapon.

225
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,205
(bleeping)

226
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:46,085
(ringing)

227
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,478
(buzzing)

228
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,605
(glass shatters)

229
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,766
- Check it.
- (cocks firearm)

230
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:06,738
<i>'</i> (man groans)
- (alarm)

231
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:16,532
Their best response time
is 19 minutes. They'll be late.

232
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,663
(klaxon)

233
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,494
It's clean. I had to ventilate someone.

234
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,284
- Good evening, Moneypenny.
- Good evening, James.

235
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,533
M will meet you in the Situation Room.
I'm to take you in.

236
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,957
- Never seen you after hours. Lovely.
- Thank you, James.

237
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,878
Out on some kind of assignment?
Dressing to kill?

238
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,543
I know you'll find this crushing, O07,

239
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:51,385
but I don't sit at home
praying for an international incident

240
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:54,846
so I can run down here
all dressed up to impress James Bond.

241
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,600
I was on a date with a gentleman.
We went to the theatre.

242
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,269
Moneypenny, I'm devastated.

243
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,639
What would I ever do without you?

244
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:07,898
As far as I can remember, James,
you've never had me.

245
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:13,281
Hope springs eternal.

246
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:17,031
This sort of behaviour
could qualify as sexual harassment.

247
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,580
Really? What's the penalty for that?

248
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,909
Someday you have to make good
on your innuendoes.

249
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:32,509
- After you, Moneypenny.
- No, I insist. You first.

250
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:40,262
<i>-</i> Good evening, O07.
- Tanner. What's up?

251
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,057
16 minutes ago,
we intercepted a distress call

252
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:47,141
from a supposedly abandoned
radar station at Severnaya. Look.

253
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:56,909
- We found a match. Your missing Tiger.
- In the middle of northern Russia?

254
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:01,329
Your hunch was right. Too bad the evil
queen of numbers wouldn't let you play it.

255
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,452
Mm-hm.

256
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:09,497
- You were saying?
- No, no. I was just... just...

257
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:14,798
Good. Because if I want sarcasm, I'll
talk to my children, thank you very much.

258
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,713
- Good evening, 007.
- Good evening, M.

259
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,925
The prime minister's
waiting for an update.

260
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:24,056
Proceed with your briefing, Mr Tanner.

261
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,308
Thank you.

262
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:30,233
Yes, after the distress signal,
your helicopter took off

263
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,144
and the Russians
had three MiGs intercept it.

264
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,731
What do you think the base is used for?

265
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,658
We suspected it might be
the ground station

266
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:42,575
for a secret space-based
weapon called Go|denEye, but...

267
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:47,535
Our statistical analysis saw they had
neither the finance nor technology.

268
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,666
Numbers were never my strong suit.

269
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,210
Are these pictures live?

270
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:57,093
Unlike the American government, we
prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.

271
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,532
Negative so far.
Everything seems normal.

272
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,668
(alarm sounds)

273
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,264
What the bloody hell was that?

274
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:40,234
Aaaarghhh!

275
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,764
(shrieks)

276
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,811
Aaarghhhh!

277
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,599
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.

278
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,604
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova!

279
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,155
(claﬂg)

280
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,432
Aargh!

281
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,938
Boris! Boris!

282
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,353
Thanks.

283
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:25,812
Our satellite is knocked out.
So are two of the Americans'.

284
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:31,410
We have another,
coming into range... now.

285
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:37,290
Good God.

286
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,747
Two of the MiGs are down.

287
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:43,250
It looks like the third went into the dish.

288
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,377
What do you think?

289
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:50,546
No lights. Not one single
electric light on in a 30-mile radius.

290
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,598
- EMP?
- It would explain the MiGs and satellites.

291
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:57,473
- And the blackout.
- Electromagnetic pulse.

292
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:02,558
- A satellite weapon developed by the...
- Americans and Soviets in the Cold War.

293
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,730
I've read the brief.

294
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:09,440
Discovered after Hiroshima. Set off
a nuclear device in the upper atmosphere.

295
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:14,699
Creates a pulse, a radiation surge,
that destroys everything electronic.

296
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:20,033
The idea being to knock out the enemy's
communications before they can retaliate.

297
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,623
So, Golden Eye exists.

298
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,335
Yes.

299
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,876
- Could this be an accident?
- No. The helicopter.

300
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:33,422
For stealing the GoldenEye,
it was the perfect getaway vehicle.

301
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:37,099
Setting off the blast would
wipe out any trace of the crime.

302
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:41,521
- The Janus group?
- It may be linked to the helicopter.

303
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,603
I know the Russian fail-safe systems.

304
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:49,859
You just don't walk in and ask for the keys
to the bomb. You need the access codes.

305
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,818
(punches keys)

306
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,614
There had to be an insider.

307
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,999
At least one person
probably knows who it is.

308
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,719
(animal whimpering)

309
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:21,056
(barking and whining)

310
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:35,150
Very well, sir. Thank you. Good night.

311
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:41,702
The prime minister's talked to Moscow. It
was "an accident on a training exercise".

312
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,959
Governments change.
The lies stay the same.

313
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:47,044
What else do we know about Janus?

314
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,506
Top-flight arms dealers,
headquartered in St Petersburg.

315
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,551
Restocked the Iraqis during the Gulf War.

316
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:57,005
The head man's unreliably
described. No photographs.

317
00:45:57,088 --> 00:46:00,217
The woman, Onatopp,

318
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,472
is our only confirmed contact.

319
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:06,268
- Would you care for a drink?
- Thank you.

320
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:10,394
- Your predecessor kept some cognac...
- I prefer bourbon.

321
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,229
- Ice?
- Yes.

322
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:25,875
We pulled the files on whoever may have
had access or authority at Severnaya.

323
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:30,083
The top name on the list's
an old friend of yours, I understand.

324
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:36,340
Ourumov. They made him a general.

325
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:39,389
He sees himself as the next
"iron man of Russia".

326
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:43,434
Our political analysts say
he doesn't ﬁt the profile of a traitor.

327
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:47,514
Are these the same analysts who said
that Go|denEye couldn't exist?

328
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:52,644
Who said the helicopter posed no threat
and wasn't worth following?

329
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,905
You don't like me, Bond.
You don't like my methods.

330
00:46:56,981 --> 00:47:01,953
You think I'm an accountant, more
interested in numbers than your instincts.

331
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,414
- The thought had occurred to me.
- Good.

332
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:07,746
Because I think you're
a sexist, misogynist dinosaur,

333
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,921
a relic of the Cold War, whose
boyish charms, though wasted on me,

334
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:15,591
obviously appealed to that
young woman I sent out to evaluate you.

335
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,920
- Point taken.
- Not quite, O07.

336
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,723
If you think I don't have the balls
to send a man out to die,

337
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,176
your instincts are dead wrong.

338
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:28,225
I've no compunction
about sending you to your death.

339
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:32,897
But I won't do it on a whim, even
with your cavalier attitude towards life.

340
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,606
I want you to find GoldenEye.

341
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:42,034
Find who took it, what they plan
to do with it, and stop it.

342
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,658
If you come across Ourumov,
guilty or not,

343
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:50,039
don't run off on a vendetta. Avenging
Alec Trevelyan will not bring him back.

344
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:55,040
- You didn't get him killed.
- Neither did you. Don't make it personal.

345
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,879
Never.

346
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:03,385
Bond...

347
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:07,886
Come back alive.

348
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,524
(military march)

349
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,714
(knock on door)

350
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:50,762
Good morning, General Ourumov.

351
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:55,187
Defence Minister Mishkin... Gentlemen.

352
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:58,065
Please, deliver your report.

353
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:06,032
As you know, 72 hours ago, a secret
weapons system - codename GoldenEye -

354
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,204
was detonated over Severnaya.

355
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,917
As head of Space Division,
I personally undertook the investigation.

356
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:17,589
I have concluded this crime was
committed by Siberian separatists

357
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,291
seeking to create political unrest.

358
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:25,846
Regrettably, the peaceful work and the
hard-currency earnings of Severnaya

359
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,765
have been set back by several years.

360
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:31,136
Therefore, I tender my resignation.

361
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,729
(protests)

362
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:37,733
It seems the council does not want
your head, Arkady Grigorovich.

363
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:41,278
Merely your assurance that
there are no other Go|denEyes.

364
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,981
I can give you that assurance,
Defence Minister.

365
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:47,068
And what of the two missing
Severnaya technicians?

366
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,833
I was aware only of the one.
Boris Grishenko.

367
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,040
There was a girl also, whose body
was not among the dead.

368
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,339
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.
A level-two programmer.

369
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:03,092
I will investigate immediately.

370
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:08,553
It would seem presumptuous to blame
this incident on Siberian separatists

371
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:13,057
before the whereabouts
of your own people are determined.

372
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:17,352
- Do you agree?
- Yes, Defence Minister.

373
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:21,110
Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

374
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,530
That will be all.

375
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:41,880
Morning, Q. Sorry about the leg. Skiing?

376
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,836
Hunting.

377
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:49,388
Right. Now pay attention, O07.

378
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,465
First, your new car.

379
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:56,138
BMW. Agile, five forward gears,
all-points radar.

380
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,851
Self-destruct system. And, naturally,
all the usual refinements.

381
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,563
Now, this I'm particularly proud of.

382
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,570
Behind the headlights, Stinger missiles.

383
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:12,320
Excellent. Just the thing
for unwinding after a rough day.

384
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:19,082
Need I remind you, O07, that you have
a license to kill, not break the traffic laws.

385
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,204
- I wouldn't think of it.
- Good.

386
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:25,337
Right. Let's get on
to more practical matters.

387
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:31,431
A typical leather belt.
Male, size 34, buckle, notch.

388
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:35,760
Have you finished?

389
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,348
- Yes.
- Good.

390
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:40,432
- A typical belt...
- Q, I'm familiar with that device.

391
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:44,860
Not one with a 75-foot
rappelling cord built into the buckle.

392
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,155
Fire, and out shoots a piton,

393
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:52,194
followed by a high-tensile wire
designed to support your weight.

394
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:55,530
I see. And what if I need
additional support?

395
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:58,207
It's tested for one, O07.

396
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:06,006
Flight 878 to St Petersburg.

397
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,507
X-ray document scanner.

398
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,885
A pen. This is a class 4 grenade.

399
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:17,518
Three clicks arms the four-second fuse.

400
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,809
Another three disarms it.

401
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:25,893
How long did you say the fuse was?

402
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,570
Oh, grow up, O07.

403
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:32,776
- "The pen is mightier than the sword."
- Thanks to me, it is.

404
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:36,912
Look, let's ask Freddie here
to demonstrate for us.

405
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:41,663
Here we are. Sorry about this, Fred.
One, two, three.

406
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:51,047
- Don't say it.
- The writing's on the wall?

407
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,179
Along with the rest of him.

408
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,766
Now, 007, do please try and return...

409
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:01,054
(clattering)

410
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:04,731
Do try and return some of this
equipment in pristine order.

411
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,730
Don't touch that! That's my lunch.

412
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,925
In London, April's a spring month.

413
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,678
Oh, yeah? What are you -
the weatherman?

414
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,844
For cryin' out loud.
Another stiff-assed Brit,

415
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,350
with your secret codes and passwords.

416
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,684
One of these days you guys
are gonna learn just to drop it.

417
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,607
Come on. My car's over there.

418
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,999
- After you.
- Thank you.

419
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:13,088
- Like you said, drop it.
- All right.

420
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:16,797
In London, April's a spring month.
In St Petersburg, we freeze our butts off.

421
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:19,758
- Close enough for government work?
- No.

422
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,974
- Show me the rose.
- Please, no.

423
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,730
All right, all right, all right.

424
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,532
- "Ml-iffy"?
- Third wife.

425
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:45,537
<i>-</i> Jack Wade, CIA.
- James Bond, stiff-assed Brit.

426
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,618
- That's a nice move.
- Nice car.

427
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:51,831
Hasn't let me down yet. She's an ugly
little bitch, but she gets you there.

428
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:54,633
Hey, Bond. Do you do any gardening?

429
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:59,218
(announcement in Russian
over PA system)

430
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:05,182
(PA system) St Petersburg express
has now arrived at Platform 3.

431
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,690
Can you hand me that wrench, Jimmy?

432
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:17,815
- So what do you know about Janus?
- Zilch. Zipsky.

433
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:21,406
No one's ever seen him.
But the man's connected up the kazoo.

434
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:24,071
KGB, military. Screwdriver.

435
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:30,253
Rumour has it he lives on
one of those old Soviet missile trains.

436
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:34,457
That armoured stuff they used to
run around so we couldn't target 'em.

437
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:37,881
Wanna hand me that hammer, Jimbo?

438
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,421
No, the bigger one. The sledge.

439
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:44,843
Anyways, to tell the truth,
you don't find this guy. He finds you.

440
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:47,808
Hell, it's all Russian Mafia.

441
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:52,017
Best thing I can do is point you
in the direction of his competition.

442
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:59,656
- Who is the competition?
- An ex-KGB guy. Tough mother.

443
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,234
Limps on his right leg. Name's Zukovsky.

444
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:04,824
- Valentin Dimitreveych Zukovsky?
- Yeah.

445
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:07,872
- You know him?
- I gave him the limp.

446
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,688
Yes?

447
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:38,112
- Are these all you have?
- How many do you want?

448
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,367
24 for the American school,
11 for the Swedish.

449
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:48,824
IBM-compatible with 500 meg
hard drives, CD-ROM and 14.4 modems.

450
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:51,959
- You pay dollars?
- Of course.

451
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,202
If madam requires a demonstration...

452
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:58,499
Madam requires one demonstration
model and a quiet place to test it.

453
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:14,557
Natalya.

454
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,609
(typing)

455
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:35,119
- Is everything satisfactory?
- Everything except the interruption.

456
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,974
(Wade) Let me get this straight, Jimmy.

457
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:53,805
You shot him in the leg,
you stole his car, you took his girl.

458
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:57,232
And now you want Zukovsky
to set you up with Janus?

459
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,819
- (Bond) Yes.
- Are you gonna appeal to his heart?

460
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:04,023
- No. His wallet.
- That might work.

461
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:06,575
OK. Showtime.

462
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:14,575
Valentin operates
out of building number 23.

463
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:16,748
Are you sure you wanna do this?

464
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:22,376
Last guy who dropped in uninvited went
home air freight - in very small boxes.

465
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,507
Make sure they send me home first class.

466
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,601
- (screams)
- Natalya! It's me! It's Boris!

467
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,732
It's Boris. It's Boris. Hello.

468
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:27,156
Shh-shh-shh.

469
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:33,453
Another morning shot to hell.

470
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:39,368
Free-market economy!
I swear it will be the end of me.

471
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:47,130
Walther PPK, 7.65mm.

472
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:52,431
Only three men I know use such a gun.
I believe I've killed two of them.

473
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:56,386
- Lucky me.
- I think not.

474
00:59:57,052 --> 01:00:00,056
<i>Ooh-ahh</i>

475
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,732
(Russian accent) And if you love him

476
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:03,980
<i>Love him</i>

477
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:07,029
<i>Oh, be so proud of him</i>

478
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,196
<i>Of him</i>

479
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,990
<i>Cos after all</i>

480
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:13,569
<i>He's just a man</i>

481
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:18,786
<i>(tunelessly) Stand by your man...</i>

482
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:24,004
James Bond.

483
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,959
Charming, sophisticated secret agent.

484
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,670
"Shaken, but not stirred."

485
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:36,634
I see you haven't lost your
delicate sense of humour, Valentin.

486
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:39,102
Or your need for an audience.

487
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:43,936
- Who's strangling the cat?
- Strangling a cat?

488
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,234
<i>Stand by your man</i>

489
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,824
That is Irina, my mistress.

490
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:56,737
Very talented girl.

491
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,281
Irina! Take a hike!

492
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:09,087
So, Mr Bond, what is it that brings you
to my neighbourhood? Hm?

493
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:14,471
Still working for MI6, or
have you joined the 21 st century?

494
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:17,265
I hear the new M is a lady.

495
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,344
I want you to do me a favour.

496
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:25,733
He wants me to do him a favour!

497
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:32,816
My knee aches every single day.
Twice <i>as</i> bad when it is cold.

498
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:36,528
Have you any idea how long
the winter lasts in this country?

499
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:39,121
- Tell him, Dimitri.
- It depends...

500
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:40,869
Silence!

501
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:44,417
For an ex-KGB agent,
you surprise me, Valentin.

502
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:49,293
Surely you must have realised the skill
was not to hit your knee, but to...

503
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,712
Miss the rest of you.

504
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:57,423
- So why did you not kill me?
- Call it professional courtesy.

505
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,768
Then I should extend you
the same courtesy.

506
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:08,604
Kirov‘s funeral parlour,
four o'clock this afternoon.

507
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:11,937
200 pounds of C4 explosives
hidden in a casket.

508
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:15,487
Your man drives the hearse in,
the money's exchanged,

509
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,113
their man drives the hearse out.

510
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:20,912
Their man will be arrested
with the explosives.

511
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:24,996
Your man will make
a miraculous escape with the money.

512
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:27,123
Your money.

513
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:29,921
And what do I owe
for this accommodation?

514
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:33,633
I want you to set me up... with Janus.

515
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:38,589
- What has he done to deserve you?
- Stole a helicopter.

516
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:42,017
- I have six.
- Three. None that fly.

517
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:46,145
- Who's counting?
- These aren't just criminals but traitors.

518
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:51,310
They used the chopper to steal a nuclear
weapon. Killed a lot of innocent Russians.

519
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:54,112
- What do you expect from a Cossack?
- Who?

520
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:58,946
This Janus - I never met the man,
but I know he's a Lienz Cossack.

521
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:02,363
The group that worked
for the Nazis, Second World War.

522
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:05,039
You know your history.
At the end of the war,

523
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:08,710
the Lienz Cossacks surrendered
to the British in Austria,

524
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:13,256
believing they would join them
and wage war against the communists.

525
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:16,961
But the British betrayed them,
sent them back to Stalin,

526
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,886
who promptly had them all shot.

527
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:21,556
Women, children, families.

528
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:25,810
Not exactly our ﬁnest hour.

529
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:29,982
Still, ruthless people.
They got what they deserved.

530
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:34,103
I want you to set me up with Janus.
Tell him I'm asking about the chopper.

531
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:38,531
- You meet me tonight at the Grand Hotel.
- And then you and I are even and...

532
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:41,743
- he owes me one.
- Precisely.

533
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,050
You don't need the gun... Commander.

534
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:51,229
That depends on
your definition of safe sex.

535
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:58,320
That's close enough.

536
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,939
Not for what I have in mind.

537
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:15,078
(Xenia moans with pleasure)

538
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:20,125
(Xenia shrieks)

539
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:27,553
Oh, you think you can hurt me?

540
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:30,135
(laughs)

541
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:38,443
- (Bond gasps for breath)
- (Xenia shrieks with pleasure)

542
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:48,991
You think you can break me?

543
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:57,128
(Bond roars)

544
01:05:57,203 --> 01:06:00,002
(shrieking) Ah, yes! Yes! Yes!

545
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:03,256
(Xenia yelps)

546
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:09,474
No, no, no.

547
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,018
No more foreplay.

548
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,687
Take me to Janus.

549
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:15,763
Buliatch!

550
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:32,656
- This is it?
- Yes.

551
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:38,458
Well, I must say, I've had a lovely evening.

552
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:42,541
- You?
- Once again, the pleasure was all yours.

553
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:47,004
- You'll understand if I don't call.
- I won't lose sleep over it.

554
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,387
Sweet dreams.

555
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:51,909
(Clink)

556
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:05,582
Hello, James.

557
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:31,491
- Alec?
- Back from the dead.

558
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:36,079
No longer just an anonymous star
on the Memorial Wall at MI6.

559
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:40,785
What's the matter, James?
No glib remark? No pithy comeback?

560
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:44,671
- Why?
- (laughs)

561
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:48,880
Hilarious question. Particularly from you.

562
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:54,799
Did you ever ask why we toppled
all those dictators and regimes,

563
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:59,227
only to come home - "Well done!
Good job, but sorry, old boy."

564
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:02,559
"Everything you risked
your life for has changed."

565
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:06,360
- It was the job we were chosen for.
- Of course you'd say that.

566
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:09,980
James Bond, Her Majesty's loyal terrier,

567
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:12,316
defender of the so-called faith.

568
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,867
Oh, please, James, put it away.

569
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:18,700
It's insulting to think
I haven't anticipated your every move.

570
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:23,247
Yes.

571
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:30,008
- I trusted you, Alec.
- Trust. What a quaint idea.

572
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:35,634
How did the MI6 screening miss
that your parents were Lienz Cossacks?

573
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:39,388
Once again, your faith
is misplaced. They knew.

574
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:41,845
We're both orphans, James.

575
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:46,186
But where your parents had the luxury
of dying in a climbing accident,

576
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:49,735
mine survived the British betrayal
and Stalin's execution squads.

577
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:55,067
But my father couldn't let himself
or my mother live with the shame of it.

578
01:09:56,651 --> 01:09:59,370
MI6 figured I was too young to remember.

579
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:02,536
And in one of life's little ironies,

580
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:05,919
the son went to work for
the government whose betrayal

581
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:09,706
caused the father to kill
himself and his wife.

582
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:15,171
Hence Janus, the two-faced
Roman god, come to life.

583
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:18,223
It wasn't God who gave me this face.

584
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:21,973
It was you, setting the timers
for three minutes instead of six.

585
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:27,433
- Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?
- No. You're supposed to die for me.

586
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:32,441
By the WHY

587
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:37,701
I did think of asking you to join
my little scheme, but somehow I knew

588
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:40,779
007's loyalty was always
to the mission,

589
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,998
never to his friend.

590
01:10:45,283 --> 01:10:47,752
Closing time, James. Last call.

591
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:49,625
(gunshot)

592
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:04,765
For England, James.

593
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:08,268
- (woman) Wake up! Mister!
- (electronic bleeps)

594
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:09,849
(woman shrieks)

595
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:13,186
Wake up, please! Wake up!

596
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,271
I'm here. I'm here!

597
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:18,403
Hurry! Hurry up! Come on!

598
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,449
Pull yourself together or we're gonna die!

599
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:28,744
- Do something! Get us out of here!
- I'm a little tied up!

600
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:30,419
Never mind.

601
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,834
(alarm)

602
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:52,702
The things we do
for frequent-flier mileage.

603
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:55,998
Here. Let me help you.

604
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,708
That's it. Mind your head.

605
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:08,643
Let me... go!

606
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:11,141
(vehicles approaching)

607
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:54,180
Who are you?

608
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,686
- Listen. I'm on your side.
- I don't know anything.

609
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:01,771
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

610
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:04,152
Look, they might be back any minute.

611
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:08,078
Are you with me, or your countrymen
who killed everyone at Severnaya?

612
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:10,951
I've never been to Severnaya.

613
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:14,375
Your watch has. Frozen
by the Golden Eye blast.

614
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:19,001
And I'm willing to bet you're the one
who climbed up the dish to get out.

615
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:23,376
- Who are you?
- I work for the British government.

616
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,962
The more you tell me,
the more I can help you.

617
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:30,221
- But I don't know anything!
- Then start with what you do know.

618
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:42,645
My name is Natalya Simonova.

619
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:46,942
I was a systems programmer
at Severnaya facility until...

620
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:49,118
Go on.

621
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:53,657
- Until they killed everyone.
- Who? Alec Trevelyan?

622
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:58,245
- No. I don't know who that is.
- Who's the insider? Who's the traitor?

623
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:00,667
Boris. Boris Grishenko.

624
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:04,676
- KGB or military?
- Computer programmer.

625
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:08,004
- There was no one else?
- No.

626
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:13,093
They're going to kill me, aren't they?

627
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:15,978
Trust me.

628
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:20,975
Trust you? I don't even know your name.

629
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:22,602
(door opens)

630
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:25,696
Good morning, Mr Bond. Sit.

631
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,869
I am Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin.

632
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:39,377
So, by what means shall we
execute you, Commander Bond?

633
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:41,542
What, no small talk?

634
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,748
No chitchat?

635
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:48,466
That's the trouble. No one has time to do
a really sinister interrogation any more.

636
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:52,466
- It's a lost art.
- Your sense of humour doesn't slay me.

637
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:55,135
- Where is the Golden Eye?
- I assumed you had it.

638
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:58,851
I have an English spy,
a programmer and a helicopter...

639
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:02,524
- That's how your traitor wants it to look.
- Who attacked Severnaya?

640
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:06,321
- Who had the codes?
- The penalty for terrorism is still death.

641
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:10,650
- And for treason?
- Stop it, both of you! Stop it.

642
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:13,236
You're like... boys with toys.

643
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:21,752
It was Ourumov.
General Ourumov set off the weapon.

644
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:24,130
I saw him do it.

645
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:28,968
- Are you certain it was Ourumov?
- Yes.

646
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:32,589
He killed everyone,
then stole the Go|denEye.

647
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:37,051
And why would he do that?

648
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:39,808
There is another satellite.

649
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:45,188
Another Golden Eye.

650
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:48,855
Thank you, Miss Simonova.

651
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:52,408
What did you say about
the lost art of interrogation, Mr Bond?

652
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:53,905
(door opens)

653
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:58,239
Defence Minister, I must protest.
This is my investigation.

654
01:16:58,322 --> 01:17:01,496
- You are out of order.
- Molcheetye. Molcheech!

655
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:05,580
From what I am hearing,
it is you who is out of order.

656
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:08,041
I've seen this gun
in the hand of our enemy.

657
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:12,425
<i>-</i> Put it down, General!
- Do you even know who the enemy is?

658
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:14,380
- Do you?
- Guard!

659
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:23,518
Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin,

660
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:28,653
murdered by
British agent James Bond,

661
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:34,742
himself shot while trying to escape.

662
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,322
Guards!

663
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:49,252
Come on!

664
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:31,040
They're in the archive!

665
01:18:35,753 --> 01:18:37,471
Down!

666
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:31,393
(Ourumov) Spread out!
Cover the other side!

667
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:33,606
Trust me.

668
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:41,277
(Natalya cries out)

669
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,407
Argh!

670
01:20:09,763 --> 01:20:12,232
Go now!

671
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:30,250
(car horn)

672
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:43,806
Faster!

673
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:06,032
Damn it.

674
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:14,837
Down the alley!

675
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:16,394
Use the bumper. That's what it's for.

676
01:22:29,153 --> 01:22:30,530
Nazad !

677
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:37,453
(police siren)

678
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:42,841
(car horn)

679
01:23:35,302 --> 01:23:37,396
(police whistle)

680
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:54,621
What was that?

681
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:33,114
Go left!

682
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:11,816
(tyres squeal)

683
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,494
Get out!

684
01:26:07,913 --> 01:26:13,340
Either you've brought me the perfect gift,
or you've made me a very unhappy man.

685
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:16,297
Mishkin got to them before I could.

686
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:19,933
Bond is alive?

687
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:22,761
- He escaped.
- Good for Bond.

688
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:26,564
Bad for you.

689
01:26:28,558 --> 01:26:31,152
Take a seat, my dear.

690
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:50,839
You know, James and I
shared everything.

691
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:55,218
Absolutely everything.

692
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:01,470
To the victor go the spoils.

693
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:13,069
You'll like it where we're going.

694
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,908
You may even learn to like me.

695
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,455
- Svinya!
<i>'</i> (bleeping)

696
01:27:31,538 --> 01:27:33,415
Stay with her.

697
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:42,428
Bond. Only Bond.

698
01:27:42,883 --> 01:27:45,602
He's going to derail us.

699
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:48,522
- Full speed!
- Shto?

700
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:50,390
Full speed! Ram him!

701
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,443
Bye-bye.

702
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:58,524
(train whistle)

703
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:58,709
Why can't you just
be a good boy and die?

704
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:00,422
You first.

705
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:02,596
You... second.

706
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:05,220
Up!

707
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:12,143
Situation analysis... hopeless.

708
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:16,318
You have no backup, no escape route.

709
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:19,362
And I have the only bargaining chip.

710
01:29:19,521 --> 01:29:24,027
- Where is she?
- Ah, yes. Your fatal weakness.

711
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:28,197
Ourumov, bring her in.

712
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:31,783
Lovely girl.

713
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:35,497
Tastes like... like strawberries.

714
01:29:35,829 --> 01:29:37,627
- I wouldn't know.
- I would.

715
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:49,051
So, back where we started, James.

716
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:51,978
Your friend, or the mission?

717
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:54,727
Drop the gun. I'll let her live.

718
01:29:58,268 --> 01:30:02,865
Ourumov... what has
this Cossack promised you?

719
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:07,327
You knew, didn't you?
He's a Lienz Cossack.

720
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:12,203
- It's in the past.
- He'll betray you! Just like everyone else.

721
01:30:12,866 --> 01:30:15,369
- ls this true?
- What's true is that in 48 hours,

722
01:30:15,452 --> 01:30:18,581
you and I will have
more money than God

723
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:22,255
and Mr Bond here will have
a small memorial service,

724
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:26,763
with only Moneypenny and a few
tearful restaurateurs in attendance.

725
01:30:27,964 --> 01:30:31,093
So, what's the choice, James?

726
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:35,272
Two targets, time enough for one shot.

727
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:37,892
The girl, or the mission?

728
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:40,943
Kill her. She means nothing to me.

729
01:30:44,147 --> 01:30:45,865
See you in hell, James.

730
01:30:57,077 --> 01:31:01,708
- One-inch armour plating.
- I'm fine, thank you very much!

731
01:31:06,503 --> 01:31:08,801
Boris. Yes!

732
01:31:09,506 --> 01:31:12,510
- What are you doing?
- Boris is on-line backing up his files.

733
01:31:12,592 --> 01:31:16,938
If I can spike him, I might be able
to find out where they're going.

734
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:22,569
- Don't stand there! Get us out of here!
- Yes, sir.

735
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:42,838
(Alec) Good luck with the floor, James.

736
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:46,669
I set the timers for six minutes -
the same six minutes you gave me.

737
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:50,179
It was the least I could do for a friend.

738
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:55,598
- What does that mean?
- We've got three minutes.

739
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:31,675
- What else do you call your bottom?
- What?

740
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:35,851
Boris' password. He plays word games
"What I sit on but don't take with me."

741
01:32:35,925 --> 01:32:38,895
- Chair.
- Like I said...

742
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:44,350
(Bond) 30 seconds.

743
01:32:44,434 --> 01:32:48,064
(Natalya) He's not in Russia,
Germany, Paris, London, Madrid,

744
01:32:48,146 --> 01:32:51,275
- 25 seconds.
- New York, Toronto, Chicago,

745
01:32:51,357 --> 01:32:53,325
- San Francisco...
- 20 seconds!

746
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:55,745
Mexico City, Rio, Miami...

747
01:33:01,868 --> 01:33:05,668
- Come on!
- Wait! He's in Cuba. Havana - no.

748
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:08,257
NOW!

749
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:31,030
Do you destroy
every vehicle you get into?

750
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:33,825
Standard operating procedure.

751
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:37,454
Boys with toys.

752
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:44,078
Maybe I should take care of
the transportation for our trip to Cuba.

753
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:46,629
Our trip?

754
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:50,000
Do you know how to disarm the weapon?

755
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:55,509
I suppose that depends on what kind of
weapon you're talking about disarming.

756
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:03,814
So... tell me. Are there any other
standard operating procedures

757
01:34:04,264 --> 01:34:06,767
I should be aware of, Commander?

758
01:34:11,938 --> 01:34:13,690
Thousands.

759
01:34:13,773 --> 01:34:16,322
But I only pay them

760
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,954
lip service.

761
01:34:41,885 --> 01:34:45,515
My whole life I dreamed
about coming to the Caribbean.

762
01:34:45,847 --> 01:34:47,849
It's so beautiful.

763
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:50,185
Not another human being in sight.

764
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:52,362
(fast bleeping)

765
01:35:03,364 --> 01:35:06,117
What is it with you and moving vehicles?

766
01:35:31,017 --> 01:35:36,148
Yo, Jimbo! Brought a little gift
from old... whatshisname? T? Z?

767
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:37,778
<i>_</i> Q_
- Yeah.

768
01:35:37,982 --> 01:35:41,612
- What are you doing here, Wade?
- Banyan trees.

769
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:45,323
Uh... lam not here. The CIA has
no knowledge, no involvement.

770
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:49,081
Nothing to do with your insertion
into Cuba, if you catch my drift.

771
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,787
Mm-hm. Yes, I do.

772
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:53,585
Borrowed the plane
from a friend in the DEA.

773
01:35:54,082 --> 01:35:56,176
The Coast Guard and the FAA
are in the loop.

774
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:58,925
You're cleared on our radar
for 0600 hours.

775
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:01,343
Here's the latest sat-int from Langley.

776
01:36:01,547 --> 01:36:05,268
- Stay below 600 feet.
- 500 feet.

777
01:36:05,551 --> 01:36:07,895
- Who's that?
- Natalya Simonova.

778
01:36:07,971 --> 01:36:11,020
- Sim-yo-nova.
- Russian minister of transportation.

779
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:13,193
(Wade clears throat)

780
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:16,654
Did you check her out?

781
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:19,153
- Head to toe.
- Right...

782
01:36:21,526 --> 01:36:25,702
So, you're lookin' for a dish the size
of a football ﬁeld, huh? Doesn't exist.

783
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:29,375
- Light a cigar in Cuba and we see it.
- I know it's there.

784
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:34,206
It's a duplicate of Severnaya, like
your secret transmitters in New Zealand.

785
01:36:34,455 --> 01:36:37,129
I've never been there.
How does she know about that?

786
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:40,462
- What if I need backup?
- Get on the radio. I'll send in the marines.

787
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:44,974
Anyway, hang a left
at the end of the runway.

788
01:36:45,091 --> 01:36:47,719
- Cuba's 80 miles on your right.
- Yo, Wade!

789
01:36:52,265 --> 01:36:55,314
Just one thing. Don't push
any of the buttons on that car.

790
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:58,814
- I'm just gonna bomb around in it.
- Exactly.

791
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:02,321
Yo, James. I got faith, but be careful.

792
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:06,617
- He knows you're comin'.
- (starts engine)

793
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:11,018
He was your friend - Trevelyan.

794
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:15,891
And now he's your enemy
and you will kill him.

795
01:38:18,059 --> 01:38:19,857
It is that simple?

796
01:38:21,062 --> 01:38:23,110
In a word, yes.

797
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:26,572
- Unless he kills you first.
- Natalya...

798
01:38:26,651 --> 01:38:31,578
You think I'm impressed? With your guns,
your killing, your death. For what?

799
01:38:31,948 --> 01:38:34,451
So you can be a hero?

800
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:38,000
- All the heroes I know are dead.
- Natalya...

801
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:41,299
How can you act like this?
How can you be so cold?

802
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:46,095
It's what keeps me alive.

803
01:38:47,213 --> 01:38:50,387
No. It's what keeps you alone.

804
01:39:29,755 --> 01:39:31,849
James...

805
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:35,478
Yes?

806
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:43,603
On the train,

807
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:49,488
when you told him to kill me
and that I meant nothing to you,

808
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:51,277
did you mean it?

809
01:39:53,613 --> 01:39:54,785
Yes.

810
01:39:56,365 --> 01:39:59,619
Basic rule: always call their bluff.

811
01:40:00,953 --> 01:40:03,047
(Bond laughs)

812
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:05,963
No.

813
01:40:39,158 --> 01:40:43,288
Turn ten degrees south, bearing 1-8-4.

814
01:40:43,371 --> 01:40:45,294
Yes, sir.

815
01:41:09,981 --> 01:41:13,531
Nothing. There is nothing here.

816
01:41:14,151 --> 01:41:16,245
Let's make another pass.

817
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:31,503
Maybe Wade was right. There is no dish.

818
01:41:34,297 --> 01:41:36,550
(Natalya screams)

819
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:31,817
Natalya.

820
01:42:36,484 --> 01:42:38,452
(Bond groans)

821
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:48,792
(shrill birdsong)

822
01:43:31,997 --> 01:43:36,798
This time, Mr Bond,
the pleasure will be all mine.

823
01:43:38,796 --> 01:43:40,798
(cries out in pain)

824
01:43:45,428 --> 01:43:47,647
(Xenia gasps with pleasure)

825
01:43:47,805 --> 01:43:50,524
(Bond growls)

826
01:43:56,564 --> 01:43:58,191
You wait for your turn.

827
01:44:06,574 --> 01:44:08,247
(shrieks)

828
01:44:32,224 --> 01:44:34,022
She always did enjoy a good squeeze.

829
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:49,038
- ls the satellite in range?
- Six minutes.

830
01:44:49,116 --> 01:44:51,835
- Prepare the dish.
- No. It's too early.

831
01:44:52,328 --> 01:44:55,423
- I am not ready.
- Do it.

832
01:44:59,168 --> 01:45:02,297
(klaxon)

833
01:45:26,028 --> 01:45:28,656
No wonder we couldn't see it.

834
01:45:38,749 --> 01:45:40,843
Come on.

835
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:58,694
The world's greatest cash card.

836
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:01,738
It had better not be rejected.

837
01:47:06,462 --> 01:47:09,591
- Mischa is on-line.
- (guard) Sir!

838
01:47:15,012 --> 01:47:16,685
Kill him.

839
01:47:17,139 --> 01:47:19,267
The man just won't take a hint.

840
01:47:19,475 --> 01:47:20,692
Hm!

841
01:47:20,768 --> 01:47:24,739
- Target coordinates?
- The target is London.

842
01:47:37,534 --> 01:47:40,333
He's getting ready to signal the satellite.

843
01:47:40,621 --> 01:47:43,340
- How do you stop it?
- The transmitter above the antenna.

844
01:48:15,781 --> 01:48:18,284
Antenna in position.

845
01:48:20,828 --> 01:48:23,001
On my count.

846
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:26,504
Three... two... one.

847
01:48:37,386 --> 01:48:40,139
(ringing)

848
01:48:55,654 --> 01:48:57,748
God save the Queen.

849
01:48:57,906 --> 01:49:00,034
(klaxon)

850
01:49:07,124 --> 01:49:09,718
(men shouting in Russian)

851
01:49:16,717 --> 01:49:20,096
- The mainframe computer.
- Don't move.

852
01:50:05,182 --> 01:50:07,230
(fast bleeping)

853
01:50:46,557 --> 01:50:49,777
James! What an unpleasant surprise.

854
01:50:49,977 --> 01:50:53,026
- We aim to please.
- Where's the girl?

855
01:50:53,856 --> 01:50:55,824
Find her!

856
01:51:02,865 --> 01:51:04,993
So, how is old Q?

857
01:51:05,701 --> 01:51:07,874
Up to his usual tricks?

858
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:10,790
The watch.

859
01:51:14,001 --> 01:51:16,925
Ah. A new model.

860
01:51:17,296 --> 01:51:19,390
Still press here, do I?

861
01:51:31,810 --> 01:51:33,858
(man shouting in Russian)

862
01:51:36,315 --> 01:51:38,534
(Bond) Interesting setup, Alec.

863
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:41,699
You break into the Bank of England
via computer,

864
01:51:41,778 --> 01:51:44,327
then transfer the money electronically

865
01:51:44,656 --> 01:51:47,705
just seconds before
you set off the Go|denEye,

866
01:51:47,951 --> 01:51:51,125
which erases any record
of the transactions.

867
01:51:51,788 --> 01:51:54,541
- Ingenious.
- Thank you, James.

868
01:51:54,875 --> 01:51:57,594
But it still boils down to petty theft.

869
01:51:58,587 --> 01:52:02,808
In the end, you're just a bank robber.
Nothing more than a common thief.

870
01:52:13,268 --> 01:52:15,771
You always did have
a small mind, James.

871
01:52:16,438 --> 01:52:21,569
It's not just erasing bank records. It's
everything on every computer in London.

872
01:52:21,652 --> 01:52:26,453
Tax records, the stock market,
credit ratings, land registries,

873
01:52:26,531 --> 01:52:28,704
criminal records.

874
01:52:28,909 --> 01:52:33,005
In 16 minutes and 43... no, 42 seconds,

875
01:52:33,497 --> 01:52:35,841
the United Kingdom
will re-enter the Stone Age.

876
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:38,920
A worldwide financial meltdown.

877
01:52:39,127 --> 01:52:43,223
And all so mad little Alec can settle
a score with the world 50 years on.

878
01:52:43,298 --> 01:52:47,895
Oh, please, James! Spare me the Freud.
I might <i>as</i> well ask you

879
01:52:47,970 --> 01:52:52,567
if all the vodka martinis ever silence
the screams of all the men you've killed.

880
01:52:55,435 --> 01:52:59,440
Or if you find forgiveness
in the arms of all those willing women

881
01:52:59,606 --> 01:53:01,984
for all the dead ones
you failed to protect.

882
01:53:04,194 --> 01:53:07,698
England is about to learn
the cost of betrayal,

883
01:53:07,781 --> 01:53:10,660
inflation-adjusted for 1945.

884
01:53:13,161 --> 01:53:15,789
- Welcome to the party, my dear.
- (Boris) Natalya!

885
01:53:20,335 --> 01:53:22,633
(Natalya grunts with rage)

886
01:53:25,674 --> 01:53:28,097
(cocking of weapons)

887
01:53:50,657 --> 01:53:54,161
Don't ever... do that again.

888
01:53:54,494 --> 01:53:57,919
This is not one of your games, Boris.
Real people will die!

889
01:53:57,998 --> 01:54:01,047
You pathetic little worm.

890
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:04,179
She was in the mainframe.
Check the computer.

891
01:54:04,254 --> 01:54:08,350
She's a moron.
A second-level programmer.

892
01:54:09,009 --> 01:54:11,853
She works on the guidance system.

893
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:15,478
She doesn't even have access
to the ﬁring codes.

894
01:54:15,557 --> 01:54:18,151
(buzzer alarm)

895
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:21,863
Retro-rockets firing.

896
01:54:39,873 --> 01:54:45,630
- What the hell's happening?
- We will have re-entry in... 12 minutes.

897
01:54:47,089 --> 01:54:49,717
It will burn up
somewhere over the Atlantic.

898
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:53,771
- (Alec) Deal with it!
- She changed the access codes!

899
01:54:55,222 --> 01:54:57,725
Then she can fix it.

900
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:04,235
Go ahead. Shoot him.
He means nothing to me.

901
01:55:05,607 --> 01:55:08,702
I can do it! I can break her codes!

902
01:55:08,777 --> 01:55:11,280
Then get on with it!

903
01:55:38,974 --> 01:55:41,147
Tell him! Now!

904
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:45,064
Give me the codes, Natalya!
Give them to me!

905
01:56:01,496 --> 01:56:03,544
- Can Boris break your codes?
- Possibly.

906
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:05,713
Possibly?

907
01:56:06,710 --> 01:56:09,054
We have to destroy the transmitter.

908
01:56:09,129 --> 01:56:12,303
By the way, I'm fine,
thank you very much!

909
01:56:40,994 --> 01:56:44,089
Do you know how to use one of these?

910
01:56:45,999 --> 01:56:47,501
Yes.

911
01:56:47,584 --> 01:56:49,837
Good. Stay out of sight.

912
01:56:55,175 --> 01:56:57,678
(men shouting in Russian)

913
01:57:04,601 --> 01:57:06,569
- How long?
- Two minutes.

914
01:57:06,686 --> 01:57:08,233
- One minute.
- Guard!

915
01:57:08,355 --> 01:57:12,155
- I'm ﬁxing it.
- If he moves, kill him.

916
01:58:34,899 --> 01:58:38,073
Yes! I am invincible.

917
01:58:55,462 --> 01:58:56,805
(klaxon)

918
01:59:30,747 --> 01:59:31,964
(claﬂg)

919
02:00:48,616 --> 02:00:50,243
You know, James?

920
02:00:51,911 --> 02:00:53,379
I was always better.

921
02:01:10,930 --> 02:01:12,728
Alpha One to Gunship.

922
02:01:13,099 --> 02:01:15,147
<i>Alpha One to Gunship!</i>

923
02:02:15,995 --> 02:02:18,123
Speak to me!

924
02:02:53,324 --> 02:02:55,292
For England, James?

925
02:02:55,910 --> 02:02:56,957
No.

926
02:02:58,371 --> 02:02:59,588
For me.

927
02:03:00,081 --> 02:03:01,674
Aaaaarghhhhh!

928
02:03:07,630 --> 02:03:09,132
Aaaaaarghhhhh!

929
02:03:54,636 --> 02:03:56,229
Aaaarghhhhhh!

930
02:04:18,910 --> 02:04:21,629
Yes! I am invincible!

931
02:04:46,437 --> 02:04:47,984
James! James!

932
02:04:48,773 --> 02:04:50,446
Are you all right?

933
02:04:53,987 --> 02:04:55,989
Yes, I'm ﬁne. Thank you.

934
02:05:06,165 --> 02:05:08,338
Suppose someone is watching?

935
02:05:10,003 --> 02:05:12,381
There's no one within 25 miles,
believe me.

936
02:05:13,923 --> 02:05:15,550
(Wade) Yo, Jimbo!

937
02:05:24,851 --> 02:05:29,197
Is this supposed to be your idea
of "coming through in a clinch"?

938
02:05:30,815 --> 02:05:32,567
It's tobacco plants.

939
02:05:33,026 --> 02:05:35,074
I said I'd be here, huh?

940
02:05:35,153 --> 02:05:36,530
Yo! Marines!

941
02:05:47,582 --> 02:05:51,052
Maybe you two'd like to finish debriefing
each other at Guantanamo, hm?

942
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:55,928
- Ready?
- I'm not going on a helicopter with you.

943
02:05:56,007 --> 02:05:59,352
No plane, no train, nothing that moves.

944
02:05:59,427 --> 02:06:02,351
Darling, what could
possibly go wrong, hey?
