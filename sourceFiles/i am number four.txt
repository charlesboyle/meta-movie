1
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:32,503
Whoo!

2
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:03,469
You know, showboating like that
just makes you look desperate.

3
00:05:03,505 --> 00:05:07,271
Yeah, "Look at me. I can flip my ski."
Pathetic.

4
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:10,403
- Yeah.
- Daniel, that was awesome!

5
00:05:11,446 --> 00:05:13,710
Nicole.

6
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,646
Hey, Daniel, Nicole left, huh?

7
00:05:19,688 --> 00:05:22,816
Should've let me talk to her.

8
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,495
Whoo-hoo!

9
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:39,095
I love it out here.

10
00:05:42,644 --> 00:05:46,080
The Big Dipper.
It's my favorite.

11
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:49,744
- Do you know that one?
- No.

12
00:05:49,818 --> 00:05:52,548
I got a D in Astronomy.

13
00:05:56,658 --> 00:05:59,559
So, I never see you with anyone.

14
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:03,028
Do you have a girlfriend
out of town or something?

15
00:06:10,004 --> 00:06:12,097
Daniel? Daniel?

16
00:06:18,847 --> 00:06:22,044
I want you to feel this!

17
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:26,786
This is what's coming for you.

18
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:31,117
Daniel, are you OK?

19
00:06:33,328 --> 00:06:34,920
Oh, my God.

20
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:42,931
He's a freak.
He's some kind of freak.

21
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:29,944
Number Three's dead.

22
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,953
You all right?

23
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:37,822
- Yeah.
- Anyone else see what happened?

24
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:22,368
I told you not to keep this crap.
It just slows us down.

25
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,959
All right, let's go.

26
00:08:58,473 --> 00:08:59,940
Daniel.

27
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:10,881
<i>This is the part
I hate the most, the running.</i>

28
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:14,184
<i>But it's the only thing
in my life that's real.</i>

29
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:16,053
<i>The rest is a lie.</i>

30
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,285
<i>Even Henri.</i>

31
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:20,259
<i>People think he's my father.</i>

32
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:21,922
<i>He's not.</i>

33
00:09:21,963 --> 00:09:26,525
<i>He's a warrior from my planet,
assigned to keep me alive.</i>

34
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:30,065
<i>I don't remember my father.</i>

35
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:33,267
<i>All he left for me
was some kind of box.</i>

36
00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:36,072
<i>Henri says he'll pass it on to me
when the time is right.</i>

37
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,874
<i>I got my first scar
when I was nine years old,</i>

38
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,441
<i>near the border of Mexico.</i>

39
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,283
<i>It woke me from my sleep.</i>

40
00:09:47,322 --> 00:09:51,349
<i>It was the first sign that the
Mogadorians had found us here on Earth.</i>

41
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:55,128
<i>The second scar
came when I was 12.</i>

42
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:58,495
<i>I was in Colorado,
in the middle of a spelling bee.</i>

43
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:02,698
<i>As soon as I felt it,
I knew Number Two was dead.</i>

44
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:06,702
<i>Last night, I got my third scar.</i>

45
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:14,313
<i>I was just a kid when the Mogadorians
invaded my planet, Lorien.</i>

46
00:10:14,349 --> 00:10:16,817
<i>Nine of us children escaped.</i>

47
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:21,321
<i>We were gifted, meant to protect
our people when we grew up.</i>

48
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:25,053
<i>We never got the chance.
Everyone was killed.</i>

49
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:29,161
<i>We are the last of our kind.</i>

50
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,462
<i>Three of us are gone. Dead.</i>

51
00:10:33,501 --> 00:10:36,732
<i>They are hunting us down,
one by one, in order.</i>

52
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:40,336
<i>I know I'm next.</i>

53
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,509
<i>I am Number Four.</i>

54
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:44,875
All right, well, so...

55
00:10:44,946 --> 00:10:47,847
Daniel won't be in school
the rest of the semester.

56
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:50,383
OK. You, too.

57
00:10:52,387 --> 00:10:53,752
Your new ID.

58
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:59,026
And this time, you stay out of sight,
huh? No school, no teams, nothing.

59
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,051
John Smith. Very original.

60
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:04,292
I don't want to be original.
I want to be invisible.

61
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:10,297
This time was different.

62
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:12,329
I didn't just get a scar.

63
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:14,967
I, uh... I saw Number Three.

64
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:20,708
I felt the knife, I felt him die.
I could tell we all did.

65
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:25,316
- The others.
- We should get moving.

66
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:28,015
Mogadorians could've
already picked up our scent.

67
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:33,123
We're going to Paradise.
I have business to take care of.

68
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:42,955
It's Bernie Kosar.

69
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,399
Played football.

70
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:54,268
- Yeah, he played for Cleveland.
- Hm. Good to know.

71
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:57,072
- Next time, I get to pick the place.
- Yeah.

72
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:31,538
That's all of it.
I'm going to bed.

73
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:35,207
Ooh. Hang on.
I need a new picture.

74
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:39,008
We have to wipe out anything
that hits the Internet.

75
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:42,385
Say "Paradise."

76
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:49,486
Oh, shit.

77
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,725
This is why
I need you to be invisible.

78
00:14:23,264 --> 00:14:24,288
Get back inside.

79
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:27,599
John.

80
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:31,195
Come on. Come back inside.

81
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:43,911
Little small for a Mogadorian,
don't you think?

82
00:14:46,287 --> 00:14:48,118
I'm sure he belongs to someone.

83
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:51,283
He doesn't
have any collar or tags.

84
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:53,919
Hm. Somebody, somewhere,
must miss you, huh?

85
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:58,330
Come on.

86
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,095
Another pair of eyes
and ears watching the house?

87
00:15:01,836 --> 00:15:05,135
- I'm gonna need somebody to talk to.
- Talk to me.

88
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,441
Yeah, keep the dog.

89
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,909
What are you gonna call him?

90
00:15:12,313 --> 00:15:15,248
How about Bernie Kosar?

91
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,209
What are you doing up?

92
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:55,873
I changed my mind.

93
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,781
About what?

94
00:16:57,852 --> 00:17:00,912
Look, uh, as much fun
as you are to be around,

95
00:17:00,955 --> 00:17:04,015
I can't be a prisoner.
Uh, I have to go to school.

96
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:06,083
- No. No way, too risky.
- Come on.

97
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,685
Number Three was completely
off the grid and the Mogs got him.

98
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:10,253
- Didn't save him.
- Mm-mm.

99
00:17:10,331 --> 00:17:13,892
Come on.
I'm gonna be safer if I blend in.

100
00:17:13,968 --> 00:17:15,435
I promise I'll keep a low profile.

101
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:17,664
Look. Even if I let you, and I'm not,

102
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:19,935
you can't just waltz into school
and start class...

103
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:22,601
Do you think you're the only one
who can forge documents?

104
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:26,346
Hm. Do you have a...?

105
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,008
Five days of rations,
spare clothes, GPS, cash.

106
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:31,713
- What's your name?
- John Smith.

107
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:33,276
- Where are you from?
- Toronto.

108
00:17:33,354 --> 00:17:35,254
You seem kind of tan for Toronto.

109
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:39,486
Santa Fe, New Mexico.
I know the drill, OK?

110
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:45,455
You keep this on you.
I'll call you every hour.

111
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:47,125
If you don't pick up,
I know something's wrong.

112
00:17:47,201 --> 00:17:50,398
- Come on, every hour?
- That, or you can home school.

113
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:52,463
And I'll be your teacher.

114
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:54,972
Fine.

115
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:58,944
Hey, John, don't be stupid.
You keep your head down.

116
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:00,389
I know how to blend in.

117
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:24,469
OK, doll. Take a seat.

118
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:26,973
I'll just print up your schedule.
Back in a jiffy.

119
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:32,472
I know she's
the star photographer,

120
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:34,413
but it's not fair
to the other students.

121
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:36,109
She's using up all the vital supplies.

122
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,984
Emory, come on. "Strangers in
Paradise." At least she's creative.

123
00:18:40,054 --> 00:18:42,545
The pictures on her website
are totally inappropriate.

124
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:46,115
Mr. Behrman, if you want to keep
the photos, you should just say so.

125
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,560
Keep the photos?
They're already all over the Internet!

126
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:51,996
It's a violation to post things like
this without people's permission.

127
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:53,363
You have to do something about this.

128
00:18:53,434 --> 00:18:55,868
Mr. Behrman,
excuse us for a few minutes, OK?

129
00:19:03,444 --> 00:19:06,845
Sarah, this is not like you.

130
00:19:06,881 --> 00:19:09,315
Is there something going on?

131
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,251
- Everything's fine.
- Sarah?

132
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,311
- Honestly.
- Have a seat.

133
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,489
You can't let a few negative students
get you down.

134
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:23,327
Look, I don't want you to isolate
yourself from the rest of the school.

135
00:19:23,364 --> 00:19:28,392
- You should enjoy this year.
- OK, I'll try.

136
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:31,563
- Good.
- Can I please have my camera back?

137
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:35,268
No more photos on your website
without teacher and student permission.

138
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,037
OK.

139
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:38,806
Here's your schedule.

140
00:19:42,316 --> 00:19:46,047
Homeroom is calculus.
That's B-wing, room seven...

141
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,888
Oh, Sarah! Could you show our friend
to his locker? He's from Santa Fe.

142
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:56,420
<i>Job fair starts tomorrow.
Everybody, job fair starts tomorrow.</i>

143
00:19:56,497 --> 00:19:59,591
What kind of camera do you use?

144
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:02,867
Eavesdropping?
That's not gonna win you friends.

145
00:20:02,903 --> 00:20:04,530
- Check it out.
- What?

146
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:08,706
Tell that to the principal
with a fish tank for an office.

147
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,935
It's kind of hard not to hear.

148
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:17,445
Sorry. This whole place
is kind of a fish tank.

149
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:20,910
Well...
Room seven is down the hall,

150
00:20:20,955 --> 00:20:23,583
and, uh, that's your locker right there.

151
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:28,654
Good luck... um...

152
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:30,526
Oh, uh, John...

153
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,657
...Smith.

154
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:37,734
OK. You don't want to tell me your name.

155
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:38,795
That's fine.

156
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:49,149
That's really my name.
John Smith.

157
00:20:58,392 --> 00:21:00,952
What's up, man? You new?

158
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:06,829
Mark James. This is Kevin,
Jackson, Tyler and Max.

159
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,629
- Hey, man, what's up?
- John.

160
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:10,637
Good to meet you, John.
Where are you from?

161
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:13,640
- Santa Fe.
- Oh, New Mexico.

162
00:21:13,674 --> 00:21:15,005
Play any ball out there?

163
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:17,635
- Football?
- Yeah.

164
00:21:17,678 --> 00:21:20,272
- No.
- Play anything?

165
00:21:20,314 --> 00:21:22,475
Baseball? Soccer? Ping-pong?

166
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:24,983
Nope.

167
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:28,614
OK. No, that's cool, man.
That's totally cool.

168
00:21:28,656 --> 00:21:30,624
We could always use more
boosters in the stands, right?

169
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:34,958
Listen. You need anything,
you ask us, OK?

170
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:38,021
- We got you.
- I'll keep that in mind.

171
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:42,592
Good talking to you, big guy.

172
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,635
Look who it is.

173
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:46,867
Watch out, man.

174
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,532
Sorry, Sam.

175
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:52,545
Loser!

176
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:56,209
Wait up, fool.

177
00:21:56,283 --> 00:21:57,545
Thanks.

178
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,912
Gotta love the classics.

179
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:03,752
Homecoming king versus
the science nerd.

180
00:22:05,326 --> 00:22:07,817
Just get better with time, don't they?

181
00:22:07,861 --> 00:22:11,353
- That guy, Mark, he's...
- Soon to be irrelevant.

182
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:13,889
He's in the third year of
the best four years of his life.

183
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:20,626
So, she was like, "The solar system's
sun does not revolve around the Earth."

184
00:23:20,701 --> 00:23:22,635
I said, "Yeah, right."

185
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:26,937
Hey, Spock!

186
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:29,771
- Nailed it!
- Heads up! UFO, brother!

187
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,142
That had to hurt.

188
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:33,941
Hey, stay down, man.
Just stay down.

189
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:35,174
He's gonna cry. He's gonna cry.

190
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,717
- Oh, Mommy's coming!
- Oh...

191
00:23:40,053 --> 00:23:42,317
- Right in the face.
- Hey, are you OK?

192
00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:46,291
- Assholes.
- Yo, new dude! Little help?

193
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:58,070
Jesus!

194
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:00,232
I'm fine! Get off me.

195
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:02,070
Come on, man!

196
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:04,100
- You OK?
- No.

197
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:10,509
That's quite an arm
you got there.

198
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:13,417
Yeah. Who knew?

199
00:24:15,422 --> 00:24:17,788
So, uh, what's with the UFO thing?

200
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:20,891
I know it's your first day and all,

201
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:23,555
but, uh, sooner or later
you'll figure it out.

202
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:25,757
Figure what out?

203
00:24:26,934 --> 00:24:29,368
I'm definitely not the guy
you want to hang with.

204
00:25:25,158 --> 00:25:27,217
Invisible.

205
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:29,229
You heard me
when I said that, right?

206
00:25:29,263 --> 00:25:33,359
Yeah. Yeah, because
I remember you being there.

207
00:26:18,378 --> 00:26:22,280
<i>Let us face,
without panic, the reality of our times.</i>

208
00:26:22,316 --> 00:26:24,216
<i>The fact that atom bombs</i>

209
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:28,449
<i>may, some day, be dropped on our cities.
And let us prepare for survival</i>

210
00:26:28,522 --> 00:26:30,547
<i>by understanding the weapon
that threatens us.</i>

211
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:31,615
Yeah.

212
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:41,322
How you settling in, bro?

213
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:45,629
- Fine, thanks.
- Good. That's good.

214
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:49,039
I see you and Spock are vibing.

215
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:51,043
Got a bit of a soft spot
for freaks, do you?

216
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:52,840
Who's talking?

217
00:26:54,881 --> 00:26:57,850
Yikes.

218
00:26:57,918 --> 00:27:01,911
Look. It's cute, it really is.
You are an adorable young man.

219
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:04,150
But I find it irritating,

220
00:27:04,224 --> 00:27:06,351
so keep it on the bleachers, OK?

221
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:08,519
- All right.
- Good. That's good.

222
00:27:08,595 --> 00:27:10,256
Also, while I'm here,

223
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:11,924
I'm gonna let you in on a little tip.

224
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:31,212
Find your place fast.
Catch the rest of this flick, OK?

225
00:27:31,284 --> 00:27:33,377
Jesus, dude.
You are soaking wet.

226
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,908
John, get up.
Come on. We gotta go.

227
00:28:04,985 --> 00:28:06,009
John.

228
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:08,578
- John.
- My hands. What...?

229
00:28:08,655 --> 00:28:10,919
- Henri. My hands burn!
- John...

230
00:28:10,991 --> 00:28:12,925
- Look at me and relax.
- What's happening to me?

231
00:28:12,993 --> 00:28:14,551
They called them legacies back home.

232
00:28:14,628 --> 00:28:17,256
You, the nine,
you're the only ones who have them.

233
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,661
- Legacies?
- That's right.

234
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:20,724
Your parents were members
of the Lorien Garde.

235
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:23,258
You've inherited their abilities. Gifts.

236
00:28:23,336 --> 00:28:24,462
- Gifts?
- That's right.

237
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:26,335
My hands light up like road flares.

238
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:28,933
- And you call that a gift?
- Each legacy has its own function.

239
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:31,034
There's...
There's more coming?

240
00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:35,742
As you breathe and focus,
you're gonna learn to control them.

241
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:39,684
- OK. OK.
- Just like you're doing, right now.

242
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,052
OK?

243
00:28:43,256 --> 00:28:44,416
How do your hands feel?

244
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:49,586
- Better.
- Good.

245
00:28:51,431 --> 00:28:52,955
So, what now?

246
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:55,157
Now?

247
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:58,398
We wait. You're gonna keep
growing stronger and faster.

248
00:28:58,438 --> 00:29:00,167
I need you to be careful.

249
00:29:00,207 --> 00:29:03,301
Right now, you have to focus
your mind. Get some control.

250
00:29:03,376 --> 00:29:05,469
When you can do that,
you can get back to school.

251
00:29:05,545 --> 00:29:08,139
I don't want to raise suspicion.
I still have business here.

252
00:29:08,215 --> 00:29:10,046
In the meantime, your powers
will only draw attention.

253
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,415
You keep yourself in check,
you understand?

254
00:29:12,452 --> 00:29:15,046
So I got all these powers,
but I'm not allowed to use them?

255
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,282
Exactly.

256
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:19,640
A little early for Thanksgiving.

257
00:31:20,747 --> 00:31:22,271
Paper or plastic?

258
00:31:42,502 --> 00:31:45,266
Whoa.

259
00:32:08,628 --> 00:32:09,754
And you wind it here...

260
00:32:29,582 --> 00:32:31,311
"Strangers in Paradise"?

261
00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:36,447
I know. Arty, pretentious.

262
00:32:36,489 --> 00:32:38,684
Uh... That's not actually
what I was gonna say.

263
00:32:38,758 --> 00:32:42,057
I just needed a name for my website
and it was right there.

264
00:32:44,297 --> 00:32:48,131
You know, they should've
called this town "Ironic."

265
00:32:48,168 --> 00:32:51,194
Ironic, Ohio?
Has a ring to it.

266
00:32:53,907 --> 00:32:57,399
What's up with you?
You look different, or something.

267
00:32:57,477 --> 00:32:59,342
Sarah, come over!
I got a new bike!

268
00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:02,007
OK, I will next week.

269
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:04,380
- Hold this for a second.
- All right.

270
00:33:04,451 --> 00:33:06,510
Oh, they're so cute.

271
00:33:06,586 --> 00:33:08,679
You know, uh... I mean it.

272
00:33:08,722 --> 00:33:10,314
Uh... Your photographs...

273
00:33:10,357 --> 00:33:12,848
My parents make me babysit
for film money,

274
00:33:12,926 --> 00:33:17,056
and those are two of my victims.

275
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,530
You know, I'm, uh...

276
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:23,000
I'm actually trying to
pay you a compliment, but, uh...

277
00:33:23,036 --> 00:33:24,435
...it's not going so well.

278
00:33:25,538 --> 00:33:27,062
Oh.

279
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:30,039
Right. Um...

280
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:33,372
Thank you.

281
00:33:35,315 --> 00:33:38,716
I don't know, I just, um,
see better through this thing.

282
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:43,681
It's like my own
personal BS detector.

283
00:33:45,992 --> 00:33:47,220
Come on! Let's go!

284
00:33:49,295 --> 00:33:53,231
Excuse me. Did you forget something?
You had two things to do, you know?

285
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:55,460
- Lock the door and turn off the lights!
- That's Sam's dad?

286
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:56,593
His stepdad.

287
00:33:56,669 --> 00:33:59,695
Every night
it's the same thing with you!

288
00:34:05,011 --> 00:34:06,478
This is it.

289
00:34:15,088 --> 00:34:16,350
You live here?

290
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:20,024
Yeah, I grew up here.

291
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:28,025
- It's just a house.
- I know.

292
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,934
You hungry?

293
00:34:35,008 --> 00:34:38,307
So, John, just moved
from Santa Fe a few weeks ago.

294
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:39,970
- The Smiths, right?
- Uh, yes, sir.

295
00:34:40,046 --> 00:34:43,106
- And your father's a writer?
- Yes, he is.

296
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:45,845
Everybody really does know everything
in this town.

297
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,444
Oh, gossip spreads like Ebola.

298
00:34:48,488 --> 00:34:49,785
Question game!

299
00:34:49,823 --> 00:34:52,121
Oh! Sorry, my bad.

300
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:54,285
- All right, everybody, surrender them.
- Here you go.

301
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,659
All electronic devices.
Come on, Sarah. Thank you.

302
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,856
Hand them over.

303
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:00,729
- And you.
- Mom?

304
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,735
He'll get it back after dinner.
You'll get it back after dinner.

305
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:06,330
- Thank you, John. See? It's fine.
- All right.

306
00:35:06,406 --> 00:35:10,740
So, Santa Fe's kind of hip, right?
You bored silly here?

307
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:13,439
Nah, not with the spring carnival
coming up!

308
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,415
It's fun, and you and your folks
should definitely come.

309
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:18,747
Oh, it's just me and my dad.

310
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:20,810
Where's your mom?

311
00:35:20,854 --> 00:35:22,446
- Uh... My...
- Mom.

312
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:26,983
No, it's fine. My dad and mom,
uh, they didn't get married.

313
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,961
Uh, you know, check it out.
Carnival.

314
00:35:29,996 --> 00:35:32,362
Sarah will be there
taking pictures for the paper.

315
00:35:32,432 --> 00:35:33,524
Cheap labor.

316
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,192
- That is not why.
- No.

317
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:38,032
- She's a very talented photographer.
- Question game!

318
00:35:38,104 --> 00:35:41,164
OK. Keep your voice down,
and we will play.

319
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:44,904
It's a dinner tradition. Otherwise,
we'd never talk about the good stuff.

320
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:46,343
Worst advice you ever got?

321
00:35:47,347 --> 00:35:48,644
"Pull this."

322
00:35:48,681 --> 00:35:49,909
Oh, stop!

323
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:51,575
That's really gross.

324
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:52,845
OK, um...

325
00:35:52,886 --> 00:35:55,150
"Your parents will never know
you're gone."

326
00:35:55,188 --> 00:35:57,213
It worked with your folks.
That's how she got here.

327
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,780
- Stop it. Stop.
- Oh, my God.

328
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:00,793
- What?
- OK, Sarah, your turn.

329
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:05,593
Oh. Mom telling me that self-tanner
looks totally natural.

330
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:07,860
She was orange.

331
00:36:07,901 --> 00:36:10,369
Like a traffic cone.
On picture day.

332
00:36:10,436 --> 00:36:11,926
Oh, you should go get that picture.

333
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:13,233
- We still have the picture!
- John, you are gonna...

334
00:36:13,306 --> 00:36:15,035
Why would you want
to show him that?

335
00:36:15,108 --> 00:36:17,372
I shouldn't have said it.

336
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:19,536
I think I tore them up.

337
00:36:25,451 --> 00:36:27,282
Sorry about that.

338
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:32,515
- About what?
- My parents.

339
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:36,017
They were putting on the
"aren't we cool?" show.

340
00:36:36,062 --> 00:36:37,723
They seem very proud of you.

341
00:36:37,797 --> 00:36:39,731
Yeah, and they're already
trying to convince me

342
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:42,097
to go to the local community college
in Dayton.

343
00:36:42,168 --> 00:36:45,228
They'd love it if I stayed here.

344
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:48,399
Got into wedding photography.

345
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:51,443
What do you want to do?

346
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:57,379
That's my favorite.

347
00:36:57,417 --> 00:36:58,941
It's got all these light leaks

348
00:36:59,018 --> 00:37:02,078
so the photos come out so interesting.

349
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:04,952
Here, I'll show you.

350
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:16,994
See that one right there?

351
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,970
That's what I was talking about.

352
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,335
What's this?

353
00:37:24,177 --> 00:37:25,201
Um...

354
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:32,213
That is kind of private, actually.

355
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,883
It's amazing.

356
00:37:41,561 --> 00:37:44,029
- What?
- You...

357
00:37:45,265 --> 00:37:47,790
You're allowed
to look at everyone else...

358
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:52,133
...take our pictures, but, uh...
we're not allowed to see you?

359
00:37:58,778 --> 00:38:00,973
OK.
That's enough.

360
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:05,948
Seems like you want to run away.

361
00:38:05,985 --> 00:38:08,010
I'll just be happy
when I can get out of here.

362
00:38:08,087 --> 00:38:09,816
I don't know.
I've been to a lot of places.

363
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:12,357
You don't have to give me the
"there's no place like home" speech.

364
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:13,983
I've heard it.

365
00:38:14,027 --> 00:38:17,656
No, no. You can go wherever you want,
see whatever you want to.

366
00:38:17,697 --> 00:38:22,066
But a place is only as good
as the people you know in it.

367
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:26,734
I, uh...

368
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:35,744
I think this is a pretty good place.

369
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:52,298
Bernie, you dumb dog.

370
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,060
- Does he belong to you?
- Yeah. I gotta go.

371
00:38:57,136 --> 00:39:00,765
Well, hey. Hold on a sec.

372
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,672
Um...

373
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,783
Your turn.

374
00:39:16,055 --> 00:39:17,386
Thanks.

375
00:39:32,572 --> 00:39:34,096
I'm fine.

376
00:39:34,173 --> 00:39:36,607
Heard you made quite an impression
in class yesterday.

377
00:39:36,676 --> 00:39:39,941
Flashlight. It was a dumb prank.
But that class...

378
00:39:40,012 --> 00:39:43,038
- Boring as hell? Yeah.
- Yeah.

379
00:39:43,082 --> 00:39:47,246
Look, I know it's none of my business,
but you need to stay off the grid.

380
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,083
- What do you mean?
- It's all over the school.

381
00:39:49,122 --> 00:39:51,488
Mark James and his man-tards
have it out for you.

382
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:53,582
Sarah may act like one of us...

383
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:54,785
...she's one of them.

384
00:39:54,861 --> 00:39:56,089
He's into Sarah?

385
00:39:56,129 --> 00:39:59,098
More than that.
Nobody can go near her.

386
00:39:59,132 --> 00:40:00,827
They were like the town...

387
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,232
Whoa!

388
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:04,634
Loser!

389
00:40:04,704 --> 00:40:08,572
No... OK, come on...
Oh, God.

390
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:11,604
- Sucks to be you, bro!
- Seriously.

391
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:15,238
Want a napkin? Get a cleanup crew!

392
00:40:17,717 --> 00:40:20,049
I wonder who did that?

393
00:40:22,021 --> 00:40:23,318
What a loser.

394
00:40:23,389 --> 00:40:25,050
Leave me alone!

395
00:40:27,827 --> 00:40:29,954
Ah, ah, ah...

396
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,261
Did you have a nice time
last night, John?

397
00:40:37,637 --> 00:40:42,131
You see, in football,
a quarterback needs a few things.

398
00:40:42,175 --> 00:40:43,665
Speed, strength...

399
00:40:43,743 --> 00:40:47,440
Mostly, though, you need intuition.

400
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,846
A feeling when things
are going south.

401
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:54,886
First time we talked,
I should've listened to mine.

402
00:41:04,197 --> 00:41:07,564
There you go, John.

403
00:41:08,935 --> 00:41:11,665
Good boy.

404
00:41:11,737 --> 00:41:14,467
Maybe you got some intuition
working for you, too.

405
00:41:18,177 --> 00:41:19,508
That was awesome.

406
00:41:25,451 --> 00:41:27,316
Raided lost and found.

407
00:41:27,353 --> 00:41:30,117
- Nobody loses anything cool.
- You gotta be kidding me.

408
00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:34,388
<i>Dude, it was that or the Hannah
Montana sweatshirt. You got off easy.</i>

409
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,452
So, uh...

410
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:41,126
...who's in the picture?
- My dad.

411
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:43,465
The real one.

412
00:41:54,113 --> 00:41:55,341
<i>Where was that taken?</i>

413
00:41:56,883 --> 00:42:00,284
Mexico. The Yucatán.

414
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,085
We used to go every year looking
for evidence of ancient astronauts.

415
00:42:04,924 --> 00:42:06,516
Ancient astronauts?

416
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:09,528
Yeah. UFOs and shit.

417
00:42:09,562 --> 00:42:11,621
Freak show stuff.

418
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:14,359
He called himself an anthropologist...

419
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,960
<i>He was really just a foreman
at the steel mill.</i>

420
00:42:19,605 --> 00:42:23,097
<i>He spent all his time preparing
for some kind of alien arrival.</i>

421
00:42:24,911 --> 00:42:26,572
I used to think he was a genius.

422
00:42:26,612 --> 00:42:29,547
Had to, I guess.

423
00:42:29,582 --> 00:42:32,107
Nobody wants to admit
their dad's a freak.

424
00:42:47,033 --> 00:42:48,125
Sam...

425
00:42:48,901 --> 00:42:50,266
Sam.

426
00:42:54,173 --> 00:42:55,401
Oh!

427
00:44:43,282 --> 00:44:45,773
Malcolm, what were you up to here?

428
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,396
Jimmy, Vince,
come on, slow down, boys!

429
00:46:31,056 --> 00:46:32,785
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hey!

430
00:46:46,305 --> 00:46:49,365
Mark James decided to fire
a warning shot about you.

431
00:46:52,444 --> 00:46:56,710
When you first meet somebody,
do you dump all your stuff on them?

432
00:46:56,782 --> 00:46:59,012
All your mistakes, your secrets?

433
00:47:00,186 --> 00:47:04,680
Look, Mark and I, we changed.

434
00:47:04,757 --> 00:47:06,657
I got into photography,

435
00:47:06,692 --> 00:47:10,992
and he wanted me to be
his own personal cheerleader.

436
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:14,557
Said I was becoming a total snob.

437
00:47:14,633 --> 00:47:18,034
And when we broke up,
that's what he told everybody.

438
00:47:18,103 --> 00:47:22,130
That I was a total bitch.
And everyone listened.

439
00:47:23,542 --> 00:47:26,204
All my friends.

440
00:47:29,114 --> 00:47:31,674
Uh... I'm sorry.

441
00:47:31,717 --> 00:47:34,880
I'm not. I mean, I was...

442
00:47:35,855 --> 00:47:38,050
...but, um, I don't know,

443
00:47:38,123 --> 00:47:41,217
I kinda look at it like a total gift.

444
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,160
Got away from all of that.

445
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:48,933
So, uh, what's the hottest attraction
at this place?

446
00:47:55,808 --> 00:47:58,436
You gotta be kidding me, right?
This...

447
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:00,102
Don't be scared.

448
00:48:20,733 --> 00:48:25,102
<i>Save yourself.</i>

449
00:48:42,254 --> 00:48:45,087
Last year, she was drawn and quartered.

450
00:48:45,124 --> 00:48:47,615
It was awesome.

451
00:48:50,896 --> 00:48:53,626
My God.

452
00:49:04,243 --> 00:49:05,972
Hell's Gate.

453
00:49:06,545 --> 00:49:08,775
Everybody off.

454
00:49:30,035 --> 00:49:31,662
Quite a production.

455
00:49:31,704 --> 00:49:35,697
Hm. Small town.

456
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,353
OK. The last part got to me.

457
00:49:53,058 --> 00:49:55,083
What is that?

458
00:49:56,662 --> 00:49:58,687
Don't! Let him go! Let him go!

459
00:49:58,731 --> 00:50:01,029
Stop it!

460
00:50:03,402 --> 00:50:04,426
Hello?

461
00:50:06,605 --> 00:50:08,903
Was that real? Are you all right?

462
00:50:10,843 --> 00:50:12,868
Let me go! Stop it!

463
00:50:12,945 --> 00:50:14,776
Leave him alone!

464
00:50:36,902 --> 00:50:38,870
- No!
- Whoa! Calm down.

465
00:50:38,904 --> 00:50:41,896
- Oh, my God. Just get off me!
- Sarah, come here!

466
00:50:41,974 --> 00:50:44,568
- Idiot! It's you!
- Calm down! Calm down!

467
00:50:44,643 --> 00:50:46,907
- Let go of me.
- You can take off, OK?

468
00:50:46,979 --> 00:50:49,413
- Let go of me! Let go of me!
- Hey, listen. I will. I will!

469
00:50:50,015 --> 00:50:51,277
Sarah!

470
00:51:05,064 --> 00:51:07,032
Where is she?

471
00:51:07,066 --> 00:51:08,761
It burns, man!

472
00:51:08,801 --> 00:51:12,066
Dude, let go of me, bro, it hurts!

473
00:51:12,104 --> 00:51:15,039
She's at Shepherd Falls!
Dude, put me down. What is that?

474
00:51:20,279 --> 00:51:21,268
Where's John?

475
00:51:21,346 --> 00:51:24,474
I don't get what happened to us.
I don't. I really don't.

476
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:26,814
So you have your friend
throw me over his shoulder,

477
00:51:26,885 --> 00:51:28,785
drag me through the woods
to come here,

478
00:51:28,821 --> 00:51:32,848
when all you had to do is ask me!
Like a normal person!

479
00:51:32,925 --> 00:51:36,656
You don't have to tell me
I'm being an asshole, OK?

480
00:51:36,728 --> 00:51:39,959
But you're a problem for me, Sarah.

481
00:51:40,032 --> 00:51:42,967
Yeah, well, you really
should get over that.

482
00:51:43,035 --> 00:51:46,471
- Wait. Sarah, wait.
- Just stop it!

483
00:51:47,272 --> 00:51:48,864
You OK?

484
00:52:01,186 --> 00:52:03,552
I hope you can throw
with your left hand.

485
00:52:03,622 --> 00:52:07,888
No, John, stop! Stop!

486
00:52:19,004 --> 00:52:21,302
John. John, stop. Wait.

487
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:24,366
Hey. I just didn't want you
to break his arm.

488
00:52:24,443 --> 00:52:26,843
It's not you, it's me.
I shouldn't have lost it like that.

489
00:52:26,879 --> 00:52:28,574
Hey.

490
00:52:30,983 --> 00:52:32,814
Will you walk me home?

491
00:52:41,793 --> 00:52:44,023
You should really get that looked at.

492
00:52:45,531 --> 00:52:46,862
I will.

493
00:52:48,167 --> 00:52:49,725
I, uh...

494
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,805
I think we should talk.

495
00:53:00,445 --> 00:53:03,380
I know. It's crazy.

496
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:06,017
Mark is insane.

497
00:53:06,051 --> 00:53:08,952
And this is our last year.

498
00:53:09,021 --> 00:53:11,012
Who knows where you'll be
in three months?

499
00:53:11,056 --> 00:53:13,684
Exactly.

500
00:53:14,593 --> 00:53:16,151
Who knows?

501
00:53:18,263 --> 00:53:21,096
So, I guess I'll just...

502
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:23,031
...see you when I see you?

503
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:25,531
Yeah.

504
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,505
OK.

505
00:53:36,348 --> 00:53:38,441
Your hand's really warm.

506
00:53:55,033 --> 00:53:56,967
All I think about is you.

507
00:53:57,035 --> 00:53:59,663
All I think about is you, too.

508
00:54:23,595 --> 00:54:25,358
Where did you come from?

509
00:54:27,899 --> 00:54:30,299
All right, Mom! I got it!

510
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:41,003
- I, uh...
- Yeah, I should go.

511
00:54:50,622 --> 00:54:51,600
Bye.

512
00:55:50,215 --> 00:55:53,343
John! In here.

513
00:55:56,288 --> 00:55:57,915
So, what are you?

514
00:56:00,459 --> 00:56:03,656
You threw those football players
around like it was nothing.

515
00:56:03,695 --> 00:56:07,563
And the hand thing?
That's not human.

516
00:56:07,632 --> 00:56:10,931
So I'm asking you, what are you?

517
00:56:13,572 --> 00:56:15,130
Do I need to threaten you?

518
00:56:15,207 --> 00:56:17,573
All right, 'cause I got
some pictures on my phone,

519
00:56:17,642 --> 00:56:19,041
and they're gonna start
some major questions.

520
00:56:19,077 --> 00:56:21,045
- Give me that.
- No.

521
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:23,411
You know I can hurt you. Hm?

522
00:56:39,931 --> 00:56:42,161
Knock yourself out.

523
00:56:49,341 --> 00:56:52,367
My entire childhood...

524
00:56:53,445 --> 00:56:55,072
<i>...has been an episode of X- Files.</i>

525
00:56:58,083 --> 00:57:00,574
You know what it's like
to feel something...

526
00:57:01,686 --> 00:57:04,450
...so strong...

527
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:06,423
...that every day you have
to keep telling yourself

528
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:09,586
your dad's gonna come back
and take you away from this shithole.

529
00:57:09,628 --> 00:57:12,324
And that everything
we believed in was true.

530
00:57:12,397 --> 00:57:14,865
And that we were not crazy.

531
00:57:19,271 --> 00:57:20,295
Please.

532
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:27,200
Please.

533
00:57:30,816 --> 00:57:32,147
Your dad was right.

534
00:57:33,919 --> 00:57:35,147
What?

535
00:57:41,293 --> 00:57:42,851
He was right.

536
00:57:45,197 --> 00:57:47,427
About ancient astronauts...

537
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,960
...life on other planets...

538
00:57:53,271 --> 00:57:54,568
...all of it.

539
00:57:58,944 --> 00:58:02,471
Yes! I knew... I knew he
wouldn't just leave us!

540
00:58:02,514 --> 00:58:06,473
I mean, they found his truck near the
border of Mexico, and he was just gone.

541
00:58:06,518 --> 00:58:08,349
- Maybe they took him.
- Sam...

542
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,718
If he knew you were here,
he'd come home.

543
00:58:10,789 --> 00:58:14,122
- You can't tell anyone.
- No, I-I-I wouldn't.

544
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:16,354
No, no, no. You gotta promise me.
Nobody knows this.

545
00:58:16,428 --> 00:58:20,558
There are others from where I'm from
looking for me.

546
00:58:20,632 --> 00:58:22,930
I'm not safe.

547
00:58:23,001 --> 00:58:27,938
Sam! I know you are in there.
Get your ass in the house, now!

548
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,473
Wait until I get inside and then go.

549
00:58:30,509 --> 00:58:32,238
Sam?

550
00:58:34,246 --> 00:58:35,474
I promise.

551
00:58:38,049 --> 00:58:40,745
Yes!

552
00:58:43,822 --> 00:58:45,346
Come on.

553
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:01,738
Hey, you maniac.

554
00:59:01,806 --> 00:59:05,173
- Hello, son.
- Hey, what's with the, uh...?

555
00:59:09,614 --> 00:59:10,603
Hello, Dad.

556
00:59:10,682 --> 00:59:12,741
Sheriff James says
some boys got hurt last night.

557
00:59:12,817 --> 00:59:14,876
Couple of them
spent the night in the hospital.

558
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,410
- You said it was four?
- Yeah, four.

559
00:59:16,488 --> 00:59:19,514
- On the football team.
- Yeah, that's right.

560
00:59:19,558 --> 00:59:23,892
Of course, none of them are talking.
That includes my own boy, Mark.

561
00:59:25,597 --> 00:59:29,727
- Your son is Mark?
- Yeah, that's right.

562
00:59:29,768 --> 00:59:31,793
You know, that was his
throwing arm that got hurt.

563
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:33,861
He said you were there.

564
00:59:36,107 --> 00:59:38,598
Uh, no. I was actually with a girl.

565
00:59:38,643 --> 00:59:42,739
So I wasn't paying any attention.
Um...

566
00:59:42,781 --> 00:59:43,805
Sarah Hart?

567
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:52,081
Well, no one wants to be the first
one to say what really happened.

568
00:59:52,123 --> 00:59:55,615
But, eventually, someone will.

569
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,356
I'm sure you're right.
Thank you, Sheriff.

570
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:00,796
If we hear anything,
we'll let you know.

571
01:00:21,019 --> 01:00:23,681
- Four of them, huh?
- Yeah.

572
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:27,053
Was it difficult?

573
01:00:27,926 --> 01:00:29,985
Piece of cake.

574
01:00:30,028 --> 01:00:32,656
Good. Means you're getting it.

575
01:00:32,697 --> 01:00:34,722
Go upstairs, pack your stuff.

576
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,164
Because of last night?

577
01:00:36,234 --> 01:00:38,828
Because I don't like people
showing up asking questions.

578
01:00:38,903 --> 01:00:41,929
- And I think this is gonna raise a few.
- "They walk among us."

579
01:00:41,973 --> 01:00:43,873
What is this? Some more
"truth is out there" freaks?

580
01:00:43,942 --> 01:00:46,843
Except that's actually you.

581
01:00:46,911 --> 01:00:49,072
One of the kids must
have caught you on video.

582
01:00:49,147 --> 01:00:50,546
Oh, shit.

583
01:00:50,615 --> 01:00:52,674
<i>He's some kind of freak!</i>

584
01:00:52,717 --> 01:00:54,014
I can't get through the firewall.

585
01:00:54,052 --> 01:00:55,849
We have to go there
and take it down ourselves.

586
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,047
Mogs see this, just a matter of time.

587
01:00:58,123 --> 01:01:00,421
Pack your stuff. We're leaving.

588
01:01:01,793 --> 01:01:03,556
I'm not going.

589
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:06,726
I'm sorry, what did you say?

590
01:01:07,832 --> 01:01:09,493
I'm not going.

591
01:01:09,534 --> 01:01:12,765
OK. If you want to pick
the next place, that's fine...

592
01:01:12,837 --> 01:01:14,532
It's not my fight and it never was!

593
01:01:14,606 --> 01:01:16,870
I can't even remember
a world before this one.

594
01:01:16,941 --> 01:01:18,772
Wait, wait...

595
01:01:18,843 --> 01:01:21,175
...is this because of a girl?

596
01:01:23,014 --> 01:01:25,005
Go upstairs and get your stuff.

597
01:01:26,184 --> 01:01:29,381
- You're not my father.
- No, no, no. He's dead.

598
01:01:29,421 --> 01:01:32,254
He died for you.
In fact, you know what?

599
01:01:32,323 --> 01:01:36,225
You have no idea how many others
have made sacrifices so you could live!

600
01:01:36,294 --> 01:01:37,784
And it wasn't so you could come here

601
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:40,023
and experience puppy love
like a real live boy!

602
01:01:40,065 --> 01:01:41,760
I'm not leaving.

603
01:01:44,569 --> 01:01:47,436
John... John!

604
01:01:47,505 --> 01:01:48,767
I'm not leaving!

605
01:01:50,041 --> 01:01:53,602
Oh, yeah, I can do that now.

606
01:01:59,884 --> 01:02:01,044
Hey, John!

607
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:14,464
I'm letting go, OK?

608
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,363
- OK?
- OK.

609
01:02:28,346 --> 01:02:31,440
- On our planet...
- Just tell me why they want to kill me.

610
01:02:31,483 --> 01:02:35,977
The Mogs, they don't colonize.
They decimate. And then they move on.

611
01:02:36,054 --> 01:02:38,750
And now, they've moved here.

612
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:43,727
There are few forces that can stop them.
You and the other five can.

613
01:02:43,762 --> 01:02:45,423
You were saved for a bigger purpose.

614
01:02:45,463 --> 01:02:49,126
I'm not gonna let you throw that away
for a girl.

615
01:02:49,167 --> 01:02:51,635
She's not just a girl.

616
01:02:54,172 --> 01:02:56,299
I think about leaving her...

617
01:02:56,941 --> 01:02:58,932
...but I can't.

618
01:02:58,977 --> 01:03:01,411
And I don't know why.

619
01:03:05,383 --> 01:03:09,285
We don't love like the humans.
With us, it's forever.

620
01:03:13,391 --> 01:03:15,222
You never forget.

621
01:03:17,729 --> 01:03:22,166
If she is that for you,
then don't let them win.

622
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,566
Or you'll never forgive yourself.

623
01:03:27,672 --> 01:03:28,696
Now, we have to go.

624
01:03:30,008 --> 01:03:32,670
I'll take care of the website tonight.
Buy you a day.

625
01:03:32,744 --> 01:03:36,578
A day? To say goodbye?

626
01:03:36,648 --> 01:03:38,878
That's more than the rest of us had.

627
01:03:57,368 --> 01:03:59,268
<i>He's some kind of freak!</i>

628
01:04:09,881 --> 01:04:12,577
Henri, I'm going to Sarah's.

629
01:04:16,521 --> 01:04:17,545
Henri?

630
01:04:38,843 --> 01:04:41,607
Henri? Hello? Henri?

631
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:46,309
<i>No, but come here
and I'll tell you how to find him.</i>

632
01:04:46,384 --> 01:04:48,181
Who are you? Where's Henri?

633
01:04:48,219 --> 01:04:51,120
<i>417 Willard Court,
Warsaw, Indiana.</i>

634
01:05:01,933 --> 01:05:04,231
Come on, come on.

635
01:05:04,269 --> 01:05:05,793
I need your help.

636
01:05:10,975 --> 01:05:12,806
So, you guys... you guys don't...

637
01:05:12,877 --> 01:05:15,209
- Abduct people?
- Yeah.

638
01:05:15,246 --> 01:05:16,270
No.

639
01:05:16,314 --> 01:05:19,772
But the other guys,
the ones that are chasing you...

640
01:05:19,851 --> 01:05:21,011
...they do?

641
01:05:42,407 --> 01:05:43,897
That's it.

642
01:05:45,777 --> 01:05:47,108
Thanks.

643
01:05:54,886 --> 01:05:57,377
Whoa! You brought a gun?

644
01:05:57,455 --> 01:06:00,447
I stole it from Ed.
It might come in handy. Let's go.

645
01:06:00,525 --> 01:06:03,858
- No.
- Dude, I came here to help you.

646
01:06:03,928 --> 01:06:07,455
You have. Now, go home.

647
01:06:25,717 --> 01:06:27,378
Whoa!

648
01:06:30,121 --> 01:06:32,180
- What are you doing?
- I'm not bailing.

649
01:06:32,256 --> 01:06:33,985
What if these Mog people took my dad?

650
01:07:06,024 --> 01:07:10,461
Holy shit!

651
01:07:10,528 --> 01:07:12,689
But you just dead-bolted it.

652
01:07:14,198 --> 01:07:16,894
- OK. New plan.
- Yeah.

653
01:07:16,968 --> 01:07:20,062
You follow that guy and you
text me if he comes back, OK?

654
01:07:20,104 --> 01:07:21,935
Copy that. I'm on it.

655
01:08:56,167 --> 01:08:57,191
Henri.

656
01:09:11,649 --> 01:09:13,446
- Are you OK?
- You're not supposed to be here.

657
01:09:13,484 --> 01:09:15,645
- What happened?
- The Mogs set this up.

658
01:09:15,686 --> 01:09:18,519
We need to leave. They're coming.

659
01:09:18,556 --> 01:09:21,525
Everybody stays right where they are
or I'll shoot this kid.

660
01:09:21,559 --> 01:09:24,153
I'll do it!
Get your hands up!

661
01:09:24,195 --> 01:09:25,492
So glad you brought the gun.

662
01:09:26,864 --> 01:09:28,195
You're Malcolm's boy.

663
01:09:29,534 --> 01:09:32,799
- Get the lights, will you?
- Shut up! Get your hands up!

664
01:09:38,676 --> 01:09:39,700
Oh!

665
01:09:44,849 --> 01:09:48,376
You! You're the one
from the video on our site.

666
01:09:48,452 --> 01:09:51,512
- The one they're after.
- The one who's after?

667
01:09:51,556 --> 01:09:54,354
- What's he talking about?
- The Mogs, they've been here.

668
01:09:54,392 --> 01:09:55,723
- This was a trap.
- Yeah.

669
01:09:55,793 --> 01:09:59,229
These dudes, whatever they are, man,
they got plans, know what I'm sayin'?

670
01:09:59,263 --> 01:10:01,561
- John...
- I'm that guy, the conspiracy guy.

671
01:10:01,599 --> 01:10:04,534
Nobody gives a crap what I say.
But this is real, man!

672
01:10:04,569 --> 01:10:05,968
John. It's time to leave.

673
01:10:06,037 --> 01:10:09,734
They like it here, Earth. They're gonna
take all this shit, everything!

674
01:10:09,807 --> 01:10:11,104
John! Now!

675
01:10:11,175 --> 01:10:13,200
We either do what they say
or we are all gonna die.

676
01:10:13,244 --> 01:10:15,712
It's time to go! Now!

677
01:10:31,696 --> 01:10:34,790
John. John! John, no!

678
01:11:09,233 --> 01:11:11,098
John, go!

679
01:11:11,135 --> 01:11:12,602
- Now!
- Go!

680
01:11:38,763 --> 01:11:41,288
Start the car.
Come on! Get us out of here!

681
01:11:41,332 --> 01:11:43,027
- I can't find the keys!
- What do you mean?

682
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:45,591
- I can't find the keys!
- Come on! Come on!

683
01:11:46,437 --> 01:11:48,667
Guys, what are we waiting for?

684
01:11:50,508 --> 01:11:52,408
- I've lost the keys!
- John, start the engine.

685
01:11:52,476 --> 01:11:55,604
- What?
- You can do it. Start the car.

686
01:11:58,382 --> 01:12:00,612
- Come on.
- Start the car.

687
01:12:07,358 --> 01:12:09,553
Whoa, whoa. Come on, come on!
He's coming! He's coming!

688
01:12:09,627 --> 01:12:11,026
Start the car! Start the car!

689
01:12:11,062 --> 01:12:13,963
Use your magic powers!
Come on! We are so dead!

690
01:12:15,466 --> 01:12:18,026
Oh, my God!

691
01:12:22,006 --> 01:12:24,236
Go! Drive the car!

692
01:12:35,853 --> 01:12:37,548
You take this.

693
01:12:42,893 --> 01:12:45,361
Malcolm was using it
to track the others.

694
01:12:45,396 --> 01:12:48,661
- Wait. So, my dad was...
- He was helping us.

695
01:12:48,699 --> 01:12:50,894
He was supposed to bring us together.

696
01:12:52,703 --> 01:12:54,034
You need to find the others.

697
01:12:54,972 --> 01:12:56,462
Together you'll be more powerful.

698
01:13:09,019 --> 01:13:10,919
I can't do this without you.

699
01:13:13,023 --> 01:13:14,285
Yes, you can.

700
01:13:15,993 --> 01:13:17,688
Yes, you can.

701
01:13:19,797 --> 01:13:23,756
You have no idea
what you're capable of.

702
01:13:30,007 --> 01:13:31,031
Henri.

703
01:14:26,997 --> 01:14:28,430
Just let me talk.

704
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:32,762
OK. So, I called you like you said.

705
01:14:34,672 --> 01:14:37,038
I mean, it's not my fault they got...

706
01:14:38,809 --> 01:14:40,800
I mean, we held up our end.

707
01:14:40,845 --> 01:14:43,336
- Hm.
- We're still in?

708
01:14:43,414 --> 01:14:46,713
The whole new world order thing?

709
01:14:46,784 --> 01:14:50,777
The Locator.

710
01:14:50,821 --> 01:14:53,483
- Where is it?
- OK.

711
01:14:53,524 --> 01:14:57,688
All he had was a knife and that rock.

712
01:14:59,029 --> 01:15:00,121
And I put it...

713
01:15:02,233 --> 01:15:06,602
- It was over there, man.
- "It was over there, man."

714
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:08,729
But it's not there now.

715
01:15:30,995 --> 01:15:35,227
Cartoons for children.

716
01:15:35,266 --> 01:15:37,860
Where I'm from, men have to work.

717
01:15:37,902 --> 01:15:39,767
Look, I'll work hard.

718
01:15:39,837 --> 01:15:43,500
The disregard that so many of you
have for practical matters,

719
01:15:43,541 --> 01:15:48,103
it's... beautiful.

720
01:15:48,178 --> 01:15:50,305
I think we should
all have some fun. Huh?

721
01:15:52,249 --> 01:15:55,309
Gadgets.
You call them "toys for boys."

722
01:15:56,854 --> 01:15:58,617
I have a gadget.

723
01:15:58,689 --> 01:16:02,557
- Would you like to play with it?
- Uh... No, no. I...

724
01:16:02,593 --> 01:16:06,996
It wants to play with you!

725
01:16:20,644 --> 01:16:21,906
Need to talk to you.

726
01:16:21,946 --> 01:16:23,937
Any idea where
I might find your friend?

727
01:16:23,981 --> 01:16:26,609
He's not who you think he is.

728
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:28,481
Excuse me?

729
01:16:33,958 --> 01:16:35,550
<i>The Paradise Sheriff's Department</i>

730
01:16:35,593 --> 01:16:37,288
<i>raided the home of two suspects,</i>

731
01:16:37,328 --> 01:16:40,092
<i>seizing computers
and several suspicious items.</i>

732
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:43,463
<i>An APB has been issued on
the suspects and anyone with...</i>

733
01:16:46,937 --> 01:16:48,461
We need to get out of here.

734
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:51,935
There's a news thing.

735
01:16:51,976 --> 01:16:55,139
The cops think you and Henri
are criminals or terrorists.

736
01:17:05,889 --> 01:17:07,481
We're going back.

737
01:17:10,694 --> 01:17:12,662
I'm outside of
the home here in Warsaw

738
01:17:12,696 --> 01:17:15,859
where the mutilated bodies of
two paranormal website operators

739
01:17:15,933 --> 01:17:17,958
were just found a few hours ago.

740
01:17:18,002 --> 01:17:19,799
The police are not saying
if they have any leads

741
01:17:19,837 --> 01:17:22,203
or even why these
brutal murders occurred.

742
01:17:22,272 --> 01:17:24,604
Police have no suspects
at this time...

743
01:17:35,319 --> 01:17:36,809
- I have one of those!
- What?

744
01:17:36,854 --> 01:17:39,618
One of those.
I took it from my dad's stash.

745
01:17:39,657 --> 01:17:41,852
- I need you to get it.
- Yeah, yeah.

746
01:17:41,925 --> 01:17:45,417
Let me off at Linndale.
Sarah's at a house up there.

747
01:17:45,496 --> 01:17:47,430
I'll call you after.

748
01:17:47,498 --> 01:17:49,864
- And then what?
- Then I get the rock and you go home.

749
01:18:00,911 --> 01:18:03,038
- It's him.
- John?

750
01:18:03,647 --> 01:18:06,980
- Did you see that?
- What's he doing here?

751
01:18:08,552 --> 01:18:09,678
Yeah, he's here.

752
01:18:14,425 --> 01:18:15,585
That's him!

753
01:18:31,975 --> 01:18:33,602
Come on.

754
01:18:35,112 --> 01:18:36,272
Come on.

755
01:18:59,203 --> 01:19:01,694
Doesn't seem like your kind of crowd.

756
01:19:04,608 --> 01:19:07,771
Not so sure who my
kind of crowd is right now.

757
01:19:07,811 --> 01:19:10,405
- Look, just...
- John Smith?

758
01:19:10,447 --> 01:19:12,381
I'm such an idiot.

759
01:19:13,751 --> 01:19:16,982
And they're saying that your dad
is some kind of terrorist.

760
01:19:17,054 --> 01:19:19,181
He's not a terrorist.

761
01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:21,189
Tell me the truth.

762
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:24,389
Who are you?

763
01:19:34,838 --> 01:19:36,100
He's upstairs.

764
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:38,737
All right, guys, out of the way.

765
01:19:40,711 --> 01:19:42,941
You didn't answer my question.

766
01:19:43,814 --> 01:19:45,441
I just came to say goodbye.

767
01:19:45,482 --> 01:19:47,450
- John, wait! What are you... No, John!
- Don't move!

768
01:19:47,484 --> 01:19:49,884
Sarah!

769
01:19:59,096 --> 01:20:00,120
How...

770
01:20:00,164 --> 01:20:01,631
- Move! Move!
- Go!

771
01:20:17,314 --> 01:20:18,975
That was awesome!

772
01:20:19,016 --> 01:20:22,452
Whoa...

773
01:20:28,091 --> 01:20:29,991
What you did is not possible.

774
01:20:30,027 --> 01:20:31,551
Who I am...

775
01:20:31,628 --> 01:20:33,596
...it's all in here.
I took these for you.

776
01:20:33,664 --> 01:20:37,395
Wait. Come with me.
Please.

777
01:20:38,335 --> 01:20:40,701
Any idea where they'd be?

778
01:20:40,771 --> 01:20:43,205
I think I know
where she might go.

779
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:56,686
- Who the hell are they?
- Big-ass linebackers?

780
01:21:04,995 --> 01:21:07,190
Holy shit...

781
01:21:11,201 --> 01:21:12,964
No, no, no!

782
01:21:15,672 --> 01:21:16,764
Dad!

783
01:21:29,253 --> 01:21:33,087
An alcohol-fuelled
young guy like you...

784
01:21:33,156 --> 01:21:36,990
...healthy and well-fed.

785
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:40,655
I bet you watch a lot of television,
don't you? Do you? Do you?

786
01:21:40,731 --> 01:21:42,926
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

787
01:21:42,966 --> 01:21:45,526
In this situation here,
you're probably thinking,

788
01:21:45,569 --> 01:21:48,766
"Maybe I could save the day.
Maybe I could be the hero."

789
01:21:48,839 --> 01:21:53,071
But I say... don't do that.

790
01:21:53,110 --> 01:21:54,805
OK?

791
01:21:56,513 --> 01:21:59,744
Tell me now, where is the boy?

792
01:22:27,311 --> 01:22:29,836
These are beautiful.

793
01:22:44,461 --> 01:22:45,985
Can you show me?

794
01:23:13,824 --> 01:23:16,190
- No!
- Get in!

795
01:23:20,397 --> 01:23:23,889
Let me go! Let me go!

796
01:23:28,672 --> 01:23:29,900
Let go of me!

797
01:23:37,481 --> 01:23:39,381
- Hello?
- Where are you?

798
01:23:39,416 --> 01:23:40,508
I'm at the high school.

799
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:42,313
<i>Yeah, you need to get out of there now.</i>

800
01:23:42,352 --> 01:23:43,376
Why? What's happening?

801
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:46,218
Your stunt with the car
is already on YouTube.

802
01:23:46,289 --> 01:23:47,688
<i>If they're not right on your ass now,</i>

803
01:23:47,724 --> 01:23:49,453
<i>they will be soon.</i>

804
01:23:50,027 --> 01:23:51,392
Come on.

805
01:23:51,428 --> 01:23:53,589
And don't tell me this is not my fight.

806
01:23:53,663 --> 01:23:58,100
My dad probably knew those guys were
coming and that's why they took him.

807
01:23:58,735 --> 01:24:01,727
And also, I have your dog.

808
01:24:02,572 --> 01:24:03,732
<i>Look, I'm on my way.</i>

809
01:24:03,774 --> 01:24:05,264
<i>I'll meet you out front of the school.</i>

810
01:24:05,342 --> 01:24:07,207
<i>You've got to get out now.</i>

811
01:24:07,778 --> 01:24:09,370
<i>John?</i>

812
01:24:09,413 --> 01:24:10,471
<i>John!</i>

813
01:24:15,118 --> 01:24:16,449
Let's go.

814
01:24:20,023 --> 01:24:23,254
Let go of me!

815
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:29,755
Jesus!

816
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:33,600
Sarah! If you're in there, run!

817
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:36,400
Run!

818
01:24:39,943 --> 01:24:42,912
Let me go!

819
01:24:48,752 --> 01:24:51,653
Listen to me. I'm not gonna
let them hurt you, OK?

820
01:24:51,721 --> 01:24:54,383
Do you understand me?
Come on.

821
01:26:08,165 --> 01:26:11,157
Lt'd be a good idea, cowboy, if you
kept your heroics off the Internet.

822
01:26:13,503 --> 01:26:17,735
- Who are you?
- Number Six. Where's your protector?

823
01:26:17,807 --> 01:26:21,208
- Dead.
- Yeah. Mine, too.

824
01:26:21,244 --> 01:26:22,677
Mogs got her four months ago.

825
01:26:22,712 --> 01:26:25,272
- We've been tracking them down.
- Tracking them?

826
01:26:25,348 --> 01:26:27,578
Yeah. Lucky for you, I saved your ass.

827
01:26:27,651 --> 01:26:29,881
You should be watching your own ass.

828
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,218
Mogs have all the exits covered.

829
01:26:32,255 --> 01:26:35,247
Looks like you're gonna
have to fight to get out.

830
01:26:35,325 --> 01:26:37,555
- Are you game?
- Yeah.

831
01:26:37,594 --> 01:26:40,028
There's a tunnel under the school
that leads to the stadium.

832
01:26:40,063 --> 01:26:42,827
Oh, you made friends.
How nice.

833
01:26:44,901 --> 01:26:46,198
Let's go.

834
01:26:47,470 --> 01:26:50,064
Got any other legacies
I should know about?

835
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:51,698
Stay tuned.

836
01:27:23,873 --> 01:27:26,341
Oh, shit.

837
01:27:33,783 --> 01:27:35,216
Oh, shit!

838
01:27:44,961 --> 01:27:46,792
Careful, they'll see us.

839
01:27:48,098 --> 01:27:49,998
And you're going
to need all your energy.

840
01:27:54,104 --> 01:27:57,096
- What was that?
- They're comin'.

841
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:59,608
Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

842
01:27:59,643 --> 01:28:02,134
Whoa! Sam, what are you doing?

843
01:28:02,212 --> 01:28:03,577
Did you see what just
flew out of that truck?

844
01:28:03,613 --> 01:28:05,808
And your dog just shape-shifted
into one of them.

845
01:28:05,882 --> 01:28:09,010
I thought he was gonna eat me.
Here's your rock.

846
01:28:11,087 --> 01:28:15,023
Hi! I'm Sam. What's your name?

847
01:28:16,026 --> 01:28:17,254
Jane Doe.

848
01:28:17,294 --> 01:28:18,591
That's cool. It's cool.

849
01:28:18,628 --> 01:28:19,993
So, are you a number, too?

850
01:28:20,030 --> 01:28:23,022
- Who is this tool?
- Sam, focus.

851
01:28:23,099 --> 01:28:25,659
What flew out of the truck?

852
01:28:29,773 --> 01:28:32,333
Come on! Go, go!

853
01:28:32,375 --> 01:28:35,674
Sam. Come on! Go!

854
01:28:39,949 --> 01:28:41,712
Come on! Come on!

855
01:28:44,821 --> 01:28:47,153
Come on!

856
01:29:47,183 --> 01:29:48,275
Ahh!

857
01:29:55,925 --> 01:29:58,257
- Hit me.
- What?

858
01:29:58,328 --> 01:30:00,728
With your lumen.
I need to power-up.

859
01:30:02,932 --> 01:30:04,297
Hit me!

860
01:30:15,278 --> 01:30:17,109
Red Bull's for pussies.

861
01:30:19,449 --> 01:30:21,576
He killed Henri. I want him.

862
01:30:53,283 --> 01:30:56,343
Ah!

863
01:30:58,154 --> 01:30:59,553
Four!

864
01:31:11,768 --> 01:31:13,861
You're good with your hands.

865
01:31:13,937 --> 01:31:15,905
- Thanks.
- No problem.

866
01:31:17,407 --> 01:31:21,707
- My dog, he, uh... he just...
- Yeah, he's a chimera.

867
01:31:21,778 --> 01:31:23,905
He came with you from Lorien.

868
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:26,380
Someone had to look after you.

869
01:32:29,479 --> 01:32:31,572
You brought a gun?
Are you serious?

870
01:32:31,614 --> 01:32:34,048
- What? It might come in handy.
- This way.

871
01:32:44,761 --> 01:32:45,785
Go!

872
01:32:54,771 --> 01:32:56,398
- Take her back to the tunnel!
- Got it! Come on!

873
01:33:03,746 --> 01:33:05,976
- Holy...!
- Ahh!

874
01:33:10,587 --> 01:33:11,884
I play a lot of Xbox.

875
01:33:18,194 --> 01:33:19,218
Oh!

876
01:33:39,482 --> 01:33:41,643
Oh! Ahh!

877
01:34:51,487 --> 01:34:55,753
Number Four, I think you
have something I need. Hm?

878
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:01,729
Oh, thank you for making
this so nice and easy.

879
01:35:01,764 --> 01:35:07,031
Think of how quickly we'll finish off
the rest of the planet. It's fantastic!

880
01:35:07,770 --> 01:35:10,398
Soon, I'll be done with all of you.

881
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:12,704
Just relax.

882
01:35:14,110 --> 01:35:17,876
You can't stop what's coming.
You never could.

883
01:35:17,914 --> 01:35:20,007
You have...

884
01:35:20,049 --> 01:35:22,483
...no idea...

885
01:35:23,686 --> 01:35:25,153
...what I'm capable of.

886
01:35:41,404 --> 01:35:42,701
Ah!

887
01:36:39,629 --> 01:36:40,823
John.

888
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:45,795
Fireproof?

889
01:36:46,969 --> 01:36:49,335
I told you to stay tuned.

890
01:37:18,234 --> 01:37:20,361
All right, give me that.
Come on.

891
01:37:21,237 --> 01:37:22,465
Thank you.

892
01:37:53,502 --> 01:37:57,495
Oh. Well, that was disappointing.
So, not a tracking device?

893
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:59,599
No, it was.

894
01:37:59,675 --> 01:38:02,075
- Did you feel that, too?
- Yeah.

895
01:38:02,144 --> 01:38:05,307
- We know where we need to go.
- Yeah, we can find the others.

896
01:38:11,554 --> 01:38:14,751
- Here.
- Thank you.

897
01:38:15,725 --> 01:38:17,590
I hope this doesn't get you in trouble.

898
01:38:17,627 --> 01:38:22,121
Nah. Stuff goes missing from evidence
all the time.

899
01:38:22,198 --> 01:38:24,598
My dad won't even know.

900
01:38:24,634 --> 01:38:27,535
- You want to be heading west now.
- Why?

901
01:38:27,570 --> 01:38:30,061
Because I told my dad you're going east.

902
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:41,882
- Six, Sam's coming with us.
- What?

903
01:38:42,985 --> 01:38:44,748
- No way.
- He's one of us now.

904
01:38:44,787 --> 01:38:47,017
We need to find his father.

905
01:38:50,626 --> 01:38:54,027
You slow us down,
I'll shoot you myself.

906
01:38:54,096 --> 01:38:56,564
And I believe you.
Could we go now?

907
01:39:02,538 --> 01:39:04,665
You know, I wouldn't leave
if it wasn't, uh...

908
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:07,504
- Safer.
- Yeah.

909
01:39:07,576 --> 01:39:09,134
I know.

910
01:39:10,346 --> 01:39:12,814
Really sorry about
what happened with Henri.

911
01:39:14,083 --> 01:39:15,846
Me, too.

912
01:39:19,221 --> 01:39:21,712
You know I'll find you again.

913
01:39:24,026 --> 01:39:27,018
Probably still be here.

914
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:29,822
It's the people that make the place.

915
01:39:30,599 --> 01:39:32,931
- Right?
- Yeah.

916
01:39:39,275 --> 01:39:43,143
Henri warned me that
we only fall for one person.

917
01:39:45,348 --> 01:39:46,815
Ever?

918
01:39:47,650 --> 01:39:49,083
Ever.

919
01:41:21,877 --> 01:41:24,778
<i>'This is the first town
I've left without Henri'.</i>

920
01:41:25,714 --> 01:41:29,172
<i>'But it's also the first one
I have a reason to come back to'.</i>

921
01:41:30,553 --> 01:41:34,045
<i>'Henri was right,
we're stronger together'.</i>

922
01:41:34,590 --> 01:41:37,184
<i>'So we will find the others'.</i>

923
01:41:39,428 --> 01:41:44,058
<i>'My planet is called Lorien,
but Earth is my home now'.</i>

924
01:41:45,101 --> 01:41:48,798
<i>'It's as good a place
as any in the universe'.</i>

925
01:41:48,838 --> 01:41:51,272
<i>'And that's how it's going to stay'.</i>

926
01:41:51,473 --> 01:41:55,473
...I Am Number Four...

927
01:41:55,574 --> 01:41:59,974
<i>..subs by bishop..</i>
