1
00:01:36,255 --> 00:01:38,349
Senor O'Conner,
senor O'Conner!

2
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:45,806
It's okay, you're
just in time.

3
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:47,641
You're going to be a
great father, Brian.

4
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:50,228
What makes you so sure?

5
00:01:50,352 --> 00:01:52,400
Because I'll be there to
kick your ass if you ain't.

6
00:01:53,564 --> 00:01:54,736
Get in there. Go.

7
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,026
Brian.

8
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:01,785
Remember, the second you
go through those doors,

9
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,333
everything changes.

10
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,290
Our old life is done.

11
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,253
Let's go for a little ride.

12
00:04:45,944 --> 00:04:47,821
Special Agent Hobbs?
Riley Hicks.

13
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:50,741
I read your file. Top
of your class at FLETC.

14
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:52,251
Cairo, Tunis.

15
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:54,537
Youngest RSO ever
in Afghanistan.

16
00:04:54,703 --> 00:04:57,957
Hell, if you're half as
good as you are on paper,

17
00:04:58,123 --> 00:04:59,841
we're going to get
along just fine.

18
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,926
A Russian military
caravan attacked,

19
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:04,213
satellite component stolen.

20
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:06,006
Cars just came out of nowhere.

21
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,175
Six hospitalized, a dozen
vehicles destroyed.

22
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,891
All that in under 90
seconds, in and out.

23
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:12,016
This is world-class.

24
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:13,688
Job this good, there's
only one crew in the world

25
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:14,856
who could get this done.

26
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:17,919
How the hell did
that get up there?

27
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,239
They caught one.

28
00:05:23,398 --> 00:05:24,490
Where?

29
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,788
I got you five minutes
with this guy.

30
00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:32,416
I only need two.

31
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:44,841
I want your boss.
Where's Shaw?

32
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:51,886
I ain't telling you shit.

33
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,350
I was hoping you'd say that.

34
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:01,937
Is that legal?

35
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,067
No.

36
00:06:04,773 --> 00:06:06,741
But are you going to go
in there and tell him?

37
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:14,745
I've got rights, you asshole!

38
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,706
Not today.

39
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:24,634
No, no!

40
00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:35,349
Well, is he talking?
Not anymore.

41
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,551
That room is bugged, Hobbs.

42
00:06:36,638 --> 00:06:38,936
So, any information you just beat
out of him, Interpol has now.

43
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,898
Great. Now they can take the morning off.
Shaw's in London.

44
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,152
Let's go pick him up.

45
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:45,861
Woman, you just don't pick up
Owen Shaw like he's groceries.

46
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:48,401
If you want to catch
wolves, you need wolves.

47
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:50,194
Let's go hunting.

48
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,718
This is what 100 million buys?

49
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:51,630
It wasn't that hard
to find you, Toretto.

50
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:55,267
I wasn't hiding.

51
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,940
How's the life of the retired
international criminal?

52
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:05,481
I like it here. It's quiet.

53
00:08:05,978 --> 00:08:07,230
Nice weather,

54
00:08:08,563 --> 00:08:09,689
and no extradition.

55
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:13,364
So what are you
doing here, cop?

56
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,905
Last Tuesday, a team of
highly coordinated drivers

57
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:18,540
took down an entire
military convoy in Russia.

58
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,121
I don't do cold weather.

59
00:08:20,242 --> 00:08:21,289
I know it wasn't you.

60
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:24,405
But you're going to help me
catch the team responsible.

61
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:27,040
And you ain't gonna need that.

62
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:30,919
You can't touch him, Hobbs.
You've got no powers...

63
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:33,259
I'm not here to
extradite anyone.

64
00:08:33,422 --> 00:08:35,095
See, he's going to
come voluntarily.

65
00:08:35,257 --> 00:08:36,850
As a matter of fact,

66
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:39,595
he's going to beg me.

67
00:08:41,596 --> 00:08:43,564
This was taken a week ago.

68
00:08:46,101 --> 00:08:47,774
I'll see you out front.

69
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,042
It's Letty, isn't it?

70
00:09:11,043 --> 00:09:12,920
It's impossible.

71
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:21,721
If that was my husband, if there
was a chance, no matter how small,

72
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,474
I would go.

73
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:46,500
I'm going to need everything,
all the info you got.

74
00:09:46,661 --> 00:09:48,288
You'll get it when
the team gets it.

75
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:49,798
No team.

76
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:52,755
This is going to
have to be me alone.

77
00:09:52,918 --> 00:09:54,636
It's not that simple.

78
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:57,594
The crew we're after, they hit like
thunder and disappear like smoke.

79
00:09:57,756 --> 00:10:00,305
You go in alone, you
won't ever touch them.

80
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,141
I've been chasing this guy across
four continents and 12 countries,

81
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,584
and believe me, the last damn
place I want to be right now

82
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,809
is on your front doorstep,
selling Girl Scout cookies.

83
00:10:10,018 --> 00:10:11,941
I need your help, Dom.

84
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,108
I need your team.

85
00:10:20,112 --> 00:10:21,364
Okay, ladies, bring it in.

86
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,373
Listen, I want
to make a toast.

87
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:24,704
Come on.

88
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:29,166
Listen, I know a few of y'all
have already been to Macau,

89
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,956
but you have never
seen the town

90
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,211
till you've seen it
through my eyes.

91
00:10:32,415 --> 00:10:34,133
We got a penthouse suite

92
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:35,882
with an ocean view that's
going to change your life.

93
00:10:36,044 --> 00:10:38,763
150-foot yacht with
a helicopter pad...

94
00:10:38,922 --> 00:10:42,426
Mmm-hmm. Safe to say, you're about
to have the time of your lives.

95
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:44,557
No, you are.

96
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:46,346
Cheers.

97
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:35,361
Nice!

98
00:11:37,272 --> 00:11:39,195
I'm a citizen of the world.

99
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:44,404
Ever thought about
settling down?

100
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,244
Starting a life together?

101
00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:48,325
Aren't we doing that?

102
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,874
Are we?

103
00:12:16,853 --> 00:12:18,105
Hello?

104
00:12:19,231 --> 00:12:20,403
Dom?

105
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:23,569
I'll be there.

106
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,034
Hey, my man, I need you to
turn this plane around.

107
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:29,950
All right, listen, ladies. There's
been a little change of plans.

108
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,242
Something came up.

109
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:33,582
You know that casino I was
telling you all about?

110
00:12:33,745 --> 00:12:35,497
I got some vouchers

111
00:12:35,664 --> 00:12:37,007
to the buffet.

112
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,220
What do you think of this?

113
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,849
He likes it. All right.

114
00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:55,396
Yes.

115
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:56,601
Or this?

116
00:12:57,394 --> 00:12:58,737
Yes.

117
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:02,846
That's my boy. All right, let's
see how this thing flies.

118
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,743
Are you watching?

119
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,660
It's Uncle Dom.
What do you know?

120
00:13:14,244 --> 00:13:15,996
Are you waving? What up'?

121
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,755
Hey, Jack.

122
00:13:17,914 --> 00:13:20,258
What's up, Uncle Dom?
What's up, Uncle Dom?

123
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:22,135
You excited to see him?

124
00:13:22,294 --> 00:13:24,012
Are you already pushing
imports on him?

125
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,138
You say, "Dad's not
pushing anything."

126
00:13:26,298 --> 00:13:27,595
He chose that car.

127
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:29,304
We know he's an O'Conner, but,

128
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,603
I brought you something, Jack.

129
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,848
Yeah! He's also a Toretto.
I don't know.

130
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:37,643
Luckily, he has a couple more
years to decide, right'?

131
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:39,607
I think he decided, Mia.

132
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:42,819
I think it's time for his nap.

133
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:44,858
Come on, baby. Okay.

134
00:13:46,985 --> 00:13:48,157
Say bye.

135
00:13:48,486 --> 00:13:49,783
It's weird, huh?

136
00:13:51,114 --> 00:13:52,957
What's weird?

137
00:13:54,784 --> 00:13:56,286
We got everything.

138
00:13:56,661 --> 00:13:59,460
You know, down to the
beer and the barbeque.

139
00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:01,875
But it just...

140
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,632
I don't know, it just
doesn't feel like home.

141
00:14:05,503 --> 00:14:07,631
Maybe it's because, uh,

142
00:14:08,423 --> 00:14:10,266
you don't realize how much
you appreciate something

143
00:14:10,342 --> 00:14:12,310
until somebody takes it away.

144
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:14,263
I don't know.

145
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:16,685
The place has probably
changed so much,

146
00:14:16,765 --> 00:14:18,642
you wouldn't even
recognize it anymore.

147
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:20,025
Yeah.

148
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:24,356
Everything's changed.

149
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:27,818
So what's up with you?
What's going on?

150
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:37,164
Taken a week ago.

151
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:39,830
Diplomatic Security Service.

152
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:41,669
Hobbs.

153
00:14:47,337 --> 00:14:50,511
You know, I used to do this
shit all the time as a cop.

154
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:54,386
This is exactly what cops do.
He's messing with your head.

155
00:15:04,312 --> 00:15:06,235
Letty's dead, Dom.

156
00:15:06,398 --> 00:15:08,492
I need to know for sure.

157
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:11,870
Then I'm going with you.

158
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:13,371
You said you were going to
leave this life behind.

159
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,532
We both said that we were
leaving the life behind.

160
00:15:16,157 --> 00:15:17,534
He's right.

161
00:15:18,034 --> 00:15:19,331
We're family.

162
00:15:19,828 --> 00:15:22,502
If we got a problem, we
deal with it together.

163
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,292
And I'll feel safer knowing
you're both out there,

164
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,548
watching each other's backs.

165
00:15:27,877 --> 00:15:31,723
You're stronger together.
You always were.

166
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,226
Now go get Letty.

167
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:38,726
Bring her home.

168
00:15:57,365 --> 00:15:58,867
Thank God!

169
00:15:59,033 --> 00:16:00,910
Finally, some equipment
I can work with.

170
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:02,124
What up, boy?

171
00:16:02,203 --> 00:16:04,044
This is way better than
that trash in Rio.

172
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:07,255
Way better.

173
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:12,718
You sure about these guys?

174
00:16:13,047 --> 00:16:14,424
Nope.

175
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,018
Has anybody heard
from Leo or Santos?

176
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:21,853
Last time anyone saw them, they were
hitting up the casinos in Monte Carlo.

177
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,017
I thought that was
our last job, Brian.

178
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,733
And who's paying for all this equipment?
The taxpayers?

179
00:16:26,936 --> 00:16:29,610
So now we work for The Hulk?
That's what we're doing?

180
00:16:31,483 --> 00:16:32,826
Why do I smell baby oil?

181
00:16:32,984 --> 00:16:34,110
If you keep running
your piehole,

182
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,634
you're going to smell
an ass-kicking.

183
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:36,742
All right, Hobbs,

184
00:16:37,238 --> 00:16:38,581
you got the best
crew in the world

185
00:16:38,656 --> 00:16:39,999
standing right
in front of you.

186
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:43,082
Give them a reason to stay.

187
00:16:44,913 --> 00:16:47,007
Our target is Owen Shaw.

188
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,343
Former major in the
S.A.S., Spec-ops soldier.

189
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:53,176
He ran the UK's Mobility
Division in Kabul and Basra.

190
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:56,012
Ah, damn. That Mobility
unit's the truth.

191
00:16:56,549 --> 00:17:00,304
We're talking vehicular warfare.
Best in the world.

192
00:17:00,637 --> 00:17:02,757
Those guys don't mess around.

193
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:05,856
For years, they've been
running jobs in Europe,

194
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:07,174
but it's their
most recent jobs

195
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:09,480
that graduated them
to a whole new level.

196
00:17:09,646 --> 00:17:12,115
Three targets,
highly specific.

197
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,700
The program terminal
from an ICBM missile...

198
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,987
Got a little change?

199
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:18,746
Seriously? You're
a millionaire,

200
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,703
and you're still trying
to ask for money?

201
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:24,749
That's how you stay
a millionaire.

202
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,037
So what does this all mean?

203
00:17:26,204 --> 00:17:27,765
Well, our best guess
is that Shaw's crew

204
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,832
is building a
Nightshade device.

205
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:31,672
Which is? A tech bomb.

206
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:34,337
Designed to block an entire
military communication grid

207
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,763
for 24 hours.

208
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,595
If you blind a soldier
for a single second

209
00:17:37,674 --> 00:17:39,301
in the middle of a
fight, he dies.

210
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:42,224
If you blind a country
for 24 hours,

211
00:17:42,303 --> 00:17:43,680
the loss of life
is unthinkable.

212
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:46,725
This could be worth billions
to the right buyer.

213
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:47,855
Billions?

214
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:50,645
Why don't we just
steal that shit?

215
00:17:50,728 --> 00:17:51,775
Hey, man.

216
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,441
Which one of these
things is a dollar?

217
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:56,196
It says something about...

218
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,156
It's on the house.

219
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:08,834
I want you to help
me catch Shaw.

220
00:18:09,664 --> 00:18:11,382
He's only got one piece
left that he needs,

221
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,384
and I intend to stop
him before he gets it.

222
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:15,636
Now, I know you
guys are a family.

223
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:19,302
So I'm offering you
a chance right now

224
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:21,350
to make that family
whole again.

225
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:30,518
You want to make this
family whole again?

226
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:34,606
Get us to Letty,
we'll get you Shaw,

227
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:36,487
full pardons all
the way around.

228
00:18:40,236 --> 00:18:41,704
I can't promise you that.

229
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:43,372
Yes, you can.

230
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,121
That's the deal.

231
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:52,673
Take it or leave it.

232
00:18:58,212 --> 00:18:59,805
You get me Shaw,

233
00:19:01,215 --> 00:19:02,762
and I'll get your pardons.

234
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:05,770
You heard him.

235
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:07,475
But this is different.

236
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:08,856
We're not dealing with cops,

237
00:19:08,931 --> 00:19:10,331
we're not dealing
with drug dealers.

238
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:13,482
This is a whole
different level.

239
00:19:16,064 --> 00:19:18,533
We're getting paid, right?

240
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,704
Interpol picked up one of
Shaw's guys in Moscow.

241
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:35,584
I went in, had a little
therapy session with him.

242
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,961
He gave up Shaw's hideout.

243
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:40,888
Then why aren't we
down there now?

244
00:19:41,422 --> 00:19:42,844
Well, we weren't invited.

245
00:19:45,802 --> 00:19:48,021
Hobbs, they're sending
in your punching bag.

246
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:52,025
He's wired. He's going to give a
positive ID on Shaw before they move in.

247
00:20:05,446 --> 00:20:08,199
So, the cops just
let you go, huh?

248
00:20:09,283 --> 00:20:12,878
Don't worry, I didn't
give them shit.

249
00:20:13,496 --> 00:20:15,123
Oh, I'm not worried.

250
00:20:15,873 --> 00:20:17,125
Okay.

251
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,426
Turn it over for me.

252
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:29,770
God, it's amazing.

253
00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:34,359
The simplest things can
'cause the biggest problems.

254
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,980
Good news is, if you
swap out a bad part,

255
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:43,406
everything runs
smooth as silk again.

256
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,367
Look, Shaw...

257
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,369
Wait, Shaw! Shaw!

258
00:20:49,741 --> 00:20:51,118
Shaw!

259
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,628
I just got confirmation on Shaw.
They're going in.

260
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:12,392
Wait, wait, hold up...

261
00:21:13,556 --> 00:21:16,436
Police scanners are saying alarms are
going off at Interpol headquarters.

262
00:21:16,517 --> 00:21:17,564
Shit.

263
00:21:17,935 --> 00:21:19,903
He brought us here so he
could take down Interpol.

264
00:21:20,271 --> 00:21:21,397
This whole thing's a set-up.

265
00:21:21,564 --> 00:21:23,532
Brian, take the team.
What about you?

266
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:25,861
Hobbs and I will
wait for Shaw.

267
00:21:26,027 --> 00:21:27,779
Shaw leads to Letty.

268
00:21:35,036 --> 00:21:37,038
Come on, you son of a bitch.

269
00:21:43,127 --> 00:21:44,379
What's this?

270
00:21:45,421 --> 00:21:47,423
It's your share
from the last job.

271
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:51,678
You're part of
the team, Oakes.

272
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,846
You do your job, you get paid.

273
00:21:55,056 --> 00:21:57,275
There's a little extra
in there for you.

274
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:00,399
Consider it an advance.

275
00:22:00,561 --> 00:22:01,778
For what?

276
00:22:02,939 --> 00:22:04,987
The next job, of course.

277
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:07,075
Which job?

278
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:09,992
The one we're
working right now.

279
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,706
Han, how far are
we from Interpol?

280
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:16,994
Twelve blocks away.

281
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:18,641
You guys, it's a ghost
town over here.

282
00:22:18,746 --> 00:22:20,413
Shaw must have pulled
all the cops to him.

283
00:22:20,414 --> 00:22:23,418
All right, y'all, we're in
this shit, so let's go get it.

284
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:28,569
It's been fun running
with you, mate.

285
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:35,889
Stop! Drop the bag!

286
00:23:20,182 --> 00:23:21,434
There he is. On it.

287
00:23:25,813 --> 00:23:27,898
Toretto, it's on you. Straight
ahead, don't lose him.

288
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:28,991
Ain't gonna happen.

289
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:32,638
Sorry about that, boys.

290
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:48,146
Interpol, straight ahead.

291
00:24:54,485 --> 00:24:55,806
Let's go, guys.
We've got company.

292
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:14,593
Let's go, boys.

293
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,387
Get in! Let's go!

294
00:25:28,352 --> 00:25:30,275
Hey! We got to move. Now!

295
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,747
Shaw, we have three cars tailing us.
You know what to do.

296
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:53,757
Guys, I got the Rover.

297
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,592
Okay, I got...

298
00:25:57,715 --> 00:25:59,217
Whatever the hell
that thing is.

299
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:13,439
What is that, a hockey puck?

300
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:46,305
Oh, shit!

301
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:17,337
Approaching rendezvous point.

302
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:24,510
Dom! Tej and Roman are out!
Where you at?

303
00:27:24,677 --> 00:27:25,724
I'm right behind you!

304
00:27:44,738 --> 00:27:47,833
Stay on track. I'm
taking the contingency.

305
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:53,505
Boys, I got eyes on Shaw.
He just made a left.

306
00:27:53,664 --> 00:27:55,758
Toretto, make that left!

307
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,337
Letty.

308
00:29:36,684 --> 00:29:38,027
Take the wheel.

309
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:12,140
Letty.

310
00:30:28,152 --> 00:30:29,699
This is crazy.

311
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,406
We are not in Brazil.

312
00:30:33,824 --> 00:30:35,997
So, now we got cars
flying in the air?

313
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,255
On some 007-type shit?
This is not what we do!

314
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,757
Man, you really got to
check that emotion.

315
00:30:41,915 --> 00:30:44,714
Your voice just went from
Shaggy to Scooby-Doo.

316
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:46,504
"This is not what we..."

317
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,928
See, man, when a woman
starts shooting at you,

318
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,889
that's a clear sign
to back the fuck off!

319
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,517
We need to get the
hell out of Dodge!

320
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:00,392
That could have been
my forehead, man.

321
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,606
No.

322
00:31:01,685 --> 00:31:03,904
That's not as big
as your forehead.

323
00:31:10,694 --> 00:31:11,911
Mia...

324
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:15,749
Uh, It's definitely Letty.

325
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:18,036
But it's, uh...
It's complicated.

326
00:31:18,202 --> 00:31:19,920
Letty's alive.

327
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,922
That's all that matters.

328
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:24,675
We have her back, Brian.

329
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,345
Well, do me a favor and give
Jack a kiss goodnight for me.

330
00:31:31,507 --> 00:31:33,760
Be safe. I love you, Mia.

331
00:31:47,689 --> 00:31:49,817
She definitely
saw it was you'?

332
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:52,657
She looked dead at me, Brian.

333
00:31:53,987 --> 00:31:56,490
Maybe the Letty we once
knew is gone, Dom.

334
00:31:58,367 --> 00:32:01,086
Even though she's alive,
maybe she's gone.

335
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:04,795
You don't turn your
back on family.

336
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:09,254
Even when they do.

337
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:30,441
Ivory. Yo.

338
00:32:31,442 --> 00:32:32,989
It's going to need
some repairs.

339
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:34,950
No problem, treacle.

340
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:37,031
Are you good?

341
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:38,908
Yeah.

342
00:32:40,534 --> 00:32:42,127
Okay, listen up.

343
00:32:44,705 --> 00:32:46,082
That was a very
different breed

344
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:48,167
from Hobbs usual
wannabe warriors.

345
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,961
We need to learn who these people
are, what they're made of.

346
00:32:51,128 --> 00:32:52,175
Vegh?

347
00:32:55,757 --> 00:32:57,680
O'Conner, Parker,

348
00:32:58,552 --> 00:33:01,226
Pearce, Toretto

349
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:03,607
and the rest of the team.

350
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:06,143
These guys are
common criminals.

351
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,312
Tonight these common
criminals were seconds away

352
00:33:08,395 --> 00:33:09,772
from taking us down.

353
00:33:09,938 --> 00:33:13,112
Show them the respect they
deserve, or it weakens us.

354
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,611
You might want to see this.

355
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,957
Ring any bells?

356
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:32,969
Yeah.

357
00:33:35,172 --> 00:33:36,640
That's the guy I shot.

358
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:37,762
You look happy.

359
00:33:37,966 --> 00:33:39,263
I don't remember him.

360
00:33:39,426 --> 00:33:40,678
That's bullshit.

361
00:33:41,261 --> 00:33:42,558
We got a problem, guys.

362
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:45,440
We got a picture of her with the
guy who almost took you out.

363
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,317
Klaus, aren't you team muscle?

364
00:33:48,477 --> 00:33:51,230
Don't make me go over there
and make you team pussy.

365
00:33:53,524 --> 00:33:55,401
She doesn't remember him.

366
00:33:56,193 --> 00:33:58,195
Names and records
aren't enough.

367
00:33:58,362 --> 00:34:02,663
I want personal information. Get
into their lives, into their minds.

368
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:05,668
Find their weaknesses, and
we will exploit them.

369
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:13,419
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, right.

370
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,346
This is crazy, man.

371
00:34:16,505 --> 00:34:18,007
What are you
talking about now?

372
00:34:18,173 --> 00:34:20,801
I'm sitting here looking
at these images...

373
00:34:20,968 --> 00:34:23,517
It's like we're hunting
our evil twins.

374
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,269
Look at this black dude
right here, he's handsome.

375
00:34:26,515 --> 00:34:27,767
Clearly, that's me.

376
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,774
We got a white Hobbs.
This is Han.

377
00:34:32,354 --> 00:34:35,403
Tej, it's an African
in a beanie.

378
00:34:35,566 --> 00:34:37,694
That's like your Mini-Me, man.

379
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:40,158
And Brian!

380
00:34:41,572 --> 00:34:43,620
When did you do
this photo shoot?

381
00:34:44,241 --> 00:34:45,333
I'm just playing, man.

382
00:34:45,576 --> 00:34:47,874
You know you're the prettiest
blonde around here.

383
00:34:56,044 --> 00:34:58,012
All right, lock it up.
We got two things.

384
00:34:58,255 --> 00:35:01,225
First off, this is the worst damn
city in the world to commit a crime.

385
00:35:01,383 --> 00:35:03,056
They got cameras on
every street corner.

386
00:35:03,218 --> 00:35:05,562
I got video footage
from CCTV of the raid.

387
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:06,809
Let's track that, see
where it leads us.

388
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,727
And secondly, we just
got confirmation

389
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:10,447
on what Shaw's crew
grabbed from Interpol.

390
00:35:10,517 --> 00:35:11,638
They ripped off the database

391
00:35:11,768 --> 00:35:14,612
of every location that houses the
final component that they need.

392
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:15,777
So where are they at?

393
00:35:15,856 --> 00:35:17,697
There are over two dozen
of them around Europe.

394
00:35:17,774 --> 00:35:19,902
But the list is only
good for 96 hours.

395
00:35:20,068 --> 00:35:22,036
Which means, wherever Shaw's
crew is going to hit next,

396
00:35:22,195 --> 00:35:24,038
it's going to happen
within the next four days.

397
00:35:24,197 --> 00:35:25,494
They got a window,
and so do we.

398
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:27,375
Hobbs is right.

399
00:35:27,576 --> 00:35:28,873
So let's break this down.

400
00:35:28,952 --> 00:35:30,152
You met them. What do we know?

401
00:35:30,203 --> 00:35:32,331
We know they have to be
running custom engines.

402
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,090
You heard that flip car
going through those gears.

403
00:35:34,249 --> 00:35:35,466
Sequential transmission.

404
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:37,062
That didn't sound
like a normal engine.

405
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:38,762
That was a turbo diesel.

406
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:40,134
It sounded like something
you hear at Le Mans.

407
00:35:40,297 --> 00:35:41,344
Did you see it take
all those hits

408
00:35:41,423 --> 00:35:42,595
and still stay flat
in the corners?

409
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:43,846
Yeah, hydraulics.

410
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:45,097
Or magnetic suspension.

411
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,438
Who not only has access
to the components,

412
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,013
but can fabricate
something like that?

413
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,766
Maybe a handful of
shops in London.

414
00:35:50,932 --> 00:35:53,651
Regular tuner shops aren't
going to cut it on this one.

415
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,653
We're going to have to
dig deeper than that.

416
00:35:56,271 --> 00:35:58,148
Han, Gisele, Roman, you're up.

417
00:35:59,149 --> 00:36:01,197
We find the guy who
made that car,

418
00:36:01,652 --> 00:36:02,744
we find Shaw.

419
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:05,451
Let's go.

420
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:07,624
I'll help. Roger that.

421
00:36:07,783 --> 00:36:11,583
Tej, we're gonna need cars without
computer chips that can be overridden.

422
00:36:12,412 --> 00:36:14,665
Make sure they're fast.

423
00:36:14,956 --> 00:36:16,003
I got this.

424
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:18,802
I'm already on it, Dom.
I've contacted R&D at DSS.

425
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,428
Hobbs...

426
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,339
I said I got this.

427
00:36:24,508 --> 00:36:26,806
This should be interesting.

428
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:41,696
Man, you really
got to loosen up.

429
00:36:41,858 --> 00:36:43,235
You can't just throw a
bunch of factory-line.

430
00:36:43,236 --> 00:36:44,611
Beemers at people
and expect...

431
00:36:44,778 --> 00:36:46,405
Hey. That car is
a hell of a car.

432
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,289
You're talking about
twin-turbo V8,

433
00:36:48,365 --> 00:36:50,413
spitting out 560 ponies, son.

434
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,294
He reads the brochure.
I'm proud.

435
00:36:53,453 --> 00:36:55,376
But with cars, you
have to customize.

436
00:36:55,539 --> 00:36:57,382
It's all between you
and the car you build.

437
00:36:57,457 --> 00:36:59,130
It's a bond, it's
a commitment.

438
00:36:59,292 --> 00:37:00,965
It sounds like a marriage.

439
00:37:01,128 --> 00:37:02,880
Yeah, but with cars,
when you trade up,

440
00:37:02,963 --> 00:37:05,261
they don't take
half your shit.

441
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,097
Jesus.

442
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,820
With price tags like this, these
cars better be made out of gold.

443
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:16,898
You ain't thinking about stealing
these cars, are you, Parker?

444
00:37:17,144 --> 00:37:19,818
Kitchen help entrance
is towards the back.

445
00:37:20,856 --> 00:37:21,948
Come again?

446
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:23,240
I don't mean any
offense, gentlemen,

447
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,153
but you couldn't possibly afford
the cars in this auction.

448
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:30,495
Substantial lack of gaudy
jewelry, no entourage, no honeys.

449
00:37:30,657 --> 00:37:32,705
Clearly you're not a "baller."

450
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:33,998
And you.

451
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,088
Hmm. Shoes, shirt, trousers.

452
00:37:37,581 --> 00:37:38,628
Functional.

453
00:37:38,707 --> 00:37:40,755
And your posture, too
rigid, no swagger.

454
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:43,379
My guess is military. Take
home of 50,000 a year.

455
00:37:43,879 --> 00:37:45,256
That's U.S.

456
00:37:45,422 --> 00:37:46,674
Which is not enough
to be playing here.

457
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,683
So, if you're not
kitchen help,

458
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:50,807
then you must be in
the wrong place.

459
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:55,061
But please, do finish
your champagne.

460
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:00,236
Oh, he needs to be
taught a lesson.

461
00:38:00,353 --> 00:38:03,402
Like I said, you ain't
stealing these cars.

462
00:38:04,107 --> 00:38:05,984
I got this.

463
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:13,917
All right, this is
number five on our list.

464
00:38:18,288 --> 00:38:19,335
Holy shit.

465
00:38:19,706 --> 00:38:22,835
What's the dude plan on hunting?
Moby Dick?

466
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:24,628
That must be our guy.

467
00:38:24,795 --> 00:38:26,923
So, how do you all
want to play this?

468
00:38:27,297 --> 00:38:28,970
Han and I got this.

469
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:32,557
We go in tight, you let
me do all the talking,

470
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:34,016
and you all have
my back on it.

471
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:39,150
He's a man.

472
00:38:39,476 --> 00:38:40,728
Let's go.

473
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,522
"He's a man"?

474
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:47,363
You know, she
always says that.

475
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:57,870
What you're looking at is a
5.45 by 18 FMJ spitzer bullet.

476
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:01,006
It's specific to one
handgun, the PSM.

477
00:39:01,164 --> 00:39:03,917
Given that handguns are illegal
in the United Kingdom,

478
00:39:04,084 --> 00:39:06,678
there's very few people that
have access to that firearm.

479
00:39:06,837 --> 00:39:08,384
So if somebody wanted to, say,

480
00:39:08,463 --> 00:39:10,557
track down where it came from,

481
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,888
it wouldn't be too hard.

482
00:39:13,844 --> 00:39:15,924
I was a cop for a lot of years.
Some habits die hard.

483
00:39:16,388 --> 00:39:18,891
A pawn shop.

484
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,276
Who sent you?

485
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:32,780
Come on, ladies!

486
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,374
Two hot girls like you don't
wander into this neighborhood

487
00:39:36,449 --> 00:39:38,292
unless I've called
the escort service.

488
00:39:39,786 --> 00:39:41,333
And I haven't, yet, today.

489
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:45,588
I don't know, man. That
was disrespectful.

490
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:47,385
And I don't like the
way she said it,

491
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,337
like, "He's a man."

492
00:39:49,796 --> 00:39:52,345
"He's a man"? So, what are we?

493
00:39:52,507 --> 00:39:55,010
Come on, she's just
doing her job.

494
00:39:55,802 --> 00:39:57,930
"Doing her job."

495
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,682
I see what's going on.

496
00:40:01,474 --> 00:40:02,726
See what?

497
00:40:02,893 --> 00:40:05,988
You got the little
stardust in your eyes, eh?

498
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:08,481
Little birds floating
around a little bit.

499
00:40:13,069 --> 00:40:15,492
Uh, you don't want to lease this model.
You want to buy.

500
00:40:15,655 --> 00:40:16,827
Can you please stop talking?

501
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:20,961
No, no, you're in love!
Look at you!

502
00:40:21,036 --> 00:40:22,413
Just stop.

503
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,085
You got special plans?
Big day?

504
00:40:25,165 --> 00:40:26,486
You're going to
invite us all out?

505
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:28,593
Better make sure you get
her a big rock, man,

506
00:40:28,668 --> 00:40:31,068
'cause she doesn't look like
she'll be that easily impressed.

507
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:32,969
And if it's not a big rock,

508
00:40:33,048 --> 00:40:34,140
you better be big
somewhere else.

509
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:36,552
You know what I'm
talking about.

510
00:40:37,218 --> 00:40:40,142
That's why all your girlfriends
wear so much bling, huh?

511
00:40:42,766 --> 00:40:43,966
We're looking for information.

512
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,068
You're looking for information?
About what?

513
00:40:46,227 --> 00:40:49,231
Information about cars.

514
00:40:50,023 --> 00:40:52,367
In particular, two you
designed recently.

515
00:40:52,525 --> 00:40:55,404
Ramp cars. Low slung,
skeletal frames.

516
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:58,824
We'd be very interested to
find the man who bought those.

517
00:40:58,907 --> 00:40:59,954
Why should I help you?

518
00:41:00,033 --> 00:41:01,376
Because we're
asking you nicely.

519
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:02,873
Because you're
asking me nicely?

520
00:41:03,036 --> 00:41:05,789
What can you offer that I can't
get from a thousand other girls?

521
00:41:06,122 --> 00:41:07,874
Hmm?

522
00:41:11,044 --> 00:41:12,091
Stop! Stop!

523
00:41:19,886 --> 00:41:22,059
You look like a man
who likes it rough.

524
00:41:22,973 --> 00:41:26,978
My friend here can give
you heights of pain

525
00:41:27,143 --> 00:41:29,896
you've never
experienced before.

526
00:41:31,898 --> 00:41:32,945
Do we have a deal?

527
00:41:33,817 --> 00:41:36,445
Deal! Deal! Deal!

528
00:41:36,611 --> 00:41:37,737
I take it back.

529
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,832
Me likey.

530
00:41:54,754 --> 00:41:55,801
Stop, stop, stop.

531
00:41:55,964 --> 00:41:58,513
So this is how you "got this"?
By buying all of his cars?

532
00:41:58,675 --> 00:42:00,677
What good is having millions
of dollars in the bank

533
00:42:00,844 --> 00:42:02,187
if you don't spend any of it?

534
00:42:02,429 --> 00:42:04,181
But don't worry about that.
Watch this.

535
00:42:05,181 --> 00:42:08,310
Mr. Parker, again, can I
just express our gratitude

536
00:42:08,476 --> 00:42:10,820
and say how much we
appreciate your business.

537
00:42:10,979 --> 00:42:13,607
If there's ever anything else
you need, you just have to ask.

538
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:14,782
Anything? Mmm-hmm.

539
00:42:14,858 --> 00:42:17,532
Now that you mention it, my
swagger-less friend here,

540
00:42:17,694 --> 00:42:20,322
he really likes that
shirt you have on.

541
00:42:20,989 --> 00:42:22,457
Uh, this shirt?

542
00:42:22,782 --> 00:42:23,874
That shirt.

543
00:42:24,034 --> 00:42:26,878
I'm not entirely sure that this
shirt would fit your friend.

544
00:42:26,953 --> 00:42:28,045
It will fit.

545
00:42:28,121 --> 00:42:29,794
He needs a shirt that's
a little less...

546
00:42:29,873 --> 00:42:30,965
Functional.

547
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:32,714
That's it, functional.

548
00:42:36,129 --> 00:42:37,346
Okay.

549
00:42:42,135 --> 00:42:43,887
I'll hold that. Thank you.

550
00:42:44,137 --> 00:42:45,684
Come on, man, time is money.

551
00:42:45,847 --> 00:42:46,973
Yes, doing my best.

552
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,859
Damn, you need some hedge
clippers for that shit.

553
00:42:53,229 --> 00:42:56,403
Well, if that will be all...

554
00:42:56,649 --> 00:42:58,572
And the pants, too.

555
00:43:05,825 --> 00:43:06,917
Right.

556
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,879
While you're at it, let
me get that watch.

557
00:43:10,038 --> 00:43:11,255
I like that watch.

558
00:43:21,508 --> 00:43:22,851
This is for you.

559
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:24,932
And this is for you.
Thank you.

560
00:43:25,428 --> 00:43:27,931
Good day, gentlemen.
Thank you.

561
00:43:34,604 --> 00:43:36,197
So I, um,

562
00:43:36,272 --> 00:43:38,525
I got the information in here.

563
00:43:50,203 --> 00:43:53,457
May I ask why you're
looking for Shaw?

564
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:56,292
He took something of ours.

565
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:58,962
We'd like to talk
to him about it.

566
00:43:59,129 --> 00:44:01,223
Let's see what we've got.

567
00:44:15,061 --> 00:44:16,984
All right. What do you want?

568
00:44:17,147 --> 00:44:19,400
They say if someone's
looking for a Russian gun,

569
00:44:19,566 --> 00:44:20,658
you're the man to see.

570
00:44:20,775 --> 00:44:23,153
Oh, they do, do they?

571
00:44:27,282 --> 00:44:28,659
What do you want, mate?

572
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:38,297
That might be a bad idea.

573
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:45,596
I'm looking for the owner of this.
I don't know.

574
00:44:48,678 --> 00:44:49,975
Take a closer look.

575
00:44:50,138 --> 00:44:52,186
About a week ago,
a girl came in,

576
00:44:52,265 --> 00:44:53,665
bought guns, ammo,
everything I had.

577
00:44:53,808 --> 00:44:55,481
A girl?

578
00:44:55,643 --> 00:44:56,895
What did she look like?

579
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:58,404
Tough chick, dark hair.

580
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,072
Mean streak.

581
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:02,484
Word is she's a street racer.

582
00:45:02,609 --> 00:45:03,656
Where can we find her?

583
00:45:03,776 --> 00:45:05,403
How do I know? Do I
look like a racer?

584
00:45:07,488 --> 00:45:10,458
No. You don't.

585
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:18,963
Take care, guys.

586
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:27,516
Oh, shit.

587
00:45:43,191 --> 00:45:44,283
Sorry, girls.

588
00:45:49,697 --> 00:45:50,949
Let's go!

589
00:46:40,206 --> 00:46:41,298
Hold on.

590
00:46:41,374 --> 00:46:44,218
Stay with me. Stay with me.

591
00:46:44,377 --> 00:46:45,720
Tell me where to find Shaw,

592
00:46:45,837 --> 00:46:47,839
and I'll make him
pay for this.

593
00:46:55,013 --> 00:46:56,606
Braga...

594
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:30,556
Ow!

595
00:47:48,316 --> 00:47:49,784
Hey, you!

596
00:47:49,942 --> 00:47:50,989
Stop right there!

597
00:49:18,865 --> 00:49:20,367
You go! No, you go!

598
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,752
No one needs to
know about this.

599
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:48,747
No one.

600
00:51:02,885 --> 00:51:05,138
We lost Ivory.

601
00:51:05,304 --> 00:51:06,897
He's gone.

602
00:51:07,557 --> 00:51:08,604
Thanks.

603
00:51:13,813 --> 00:51:14,905
That's it?

604
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:18,283
If ivory's dead,
he made a mistake.

605
00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:22,076
If you make a mistake,
you pay the price.

606
00:51:26,117 --> 00:51:27,790
That's a great eulogy, Shaw.

607
00:51:28,995 --> 00:51:30,668
Are you going to
give the same speech

608
00:51:30,746 --> 00:51:32,589
for the rest of us
when we go out?

609
00:51:50,933 --> 00:51:54,437
You're the last one I'd have
pegged to be sentimental.

610
00:51:58,941 --> 00:52:00,659
I like you, Letty.

611
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:05,289
I dare say I even feel a
certain warmth towards you.

612
00:52:05,615 --> 00:52:06,895
When I found you
in the hospital,

613
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:09,372
and you couldn't
remember anything,

614
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:11,666
I said to myself,

615
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:15,879
"This girl has a gift."

616
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:19,299
"She's a blank page."

617
00:52:20,379 --> 00:52:24,054
And that made me feel somewhat
protective toward you.

618
00:52:25,343 --> 00:52:28,472
If something happened
to you, for instance,

619
00:52:28,638 --> 00:52:31,892
I think I might find that
slightly harder to bear.

620
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:36,812
What I'm saying is,

621
00:52:37,396 --> 00:52:40,525
I would hate to see you

622
00:52:40,691 --> 00:52:42,910
make a mistake.

623
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:52,002
I'm going to get some air.

624
00:53:19,897 --> 00:53:21,899
What the hell happened?
We met Dom's girlfriend.

625
00:53:22,441 --> 00:53:24,364
She's lovely.

626
00:53:24,527 --> 00:53:26,404
Are you all right? Yeah.

627
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,868
Tej, what have you got? Footage, CCTV?
Talk to me.

628
00:53:29,031 --> 00:53:30,533
I just went through all of it.

629
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,453
Believe it or not, everywhere Shaw's
team is, the cameras are down.

630
00:53:33,619 --> 00:53:35,542
That's a hell of
a coincidence.

631
00:53:36,372 --> 00:53:39,421
All right, we're going to pay
CCTV a little visit. Let's roll.

632
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:41,214
What is that?

633
00:53:41,377 --> 00:53:43,755
That is a new toy for you.

634
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:45,093
So, what happened?

635
00:53:45,256 --> 00:53:47,884
Shaw's goons showed up and
started shooting up the place.

636
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:49,393
But we got something big.

637
00:53:49,552 --> 00:53:50,974
What? Braga.

638
00:53:52,388 --> 00:53:54,311
He's working with Shaw.

639
00:53:55,891 --> 00:53:56,983
What are you talking about?

640
00:53:57,143 --> 00:53:59,896
It's true. That phone's filled
with coded payment transactions

641
00:54:00,062 --> 00:54:01,905
that lead straight
to Braga's cartel.

642
00:54:02,064 --> 00:54:03,566
Who the hell is Braga?

643
00:54:03,733 --> 00:54:06,577
He ran one of the biggest
cartels in Mexico.

644
00:54:06,736 --> 00:54:08,113
And my old boss.

645
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:10,577
We used codes just like that

646
00:54:10,656 --> 00:54:11,748
to move money out
of the country.

647
00:54:11,907 --> 00:54:12,999
It all makes sense.

648
00:54:13,659 --> 00:54:15,753
Braga was running Letty, now
he's working with Shaw.

649
00:54:15,911 --> 00:54:17,208
It would explain how
the two of them met.

650
00:54:17,288 --> 00:54:18,505
Okay, so you all know
all this information

651
00:54:18,581 --> 00:54:19,924
about him, where
do we find him?

652
00:54:19,999 --> 00:54:21,922
He's sitting in a
prison in Los Angeles.

653
00:54:22,001 --> 00:54:23,344
How do you know that?

654
00:54:25,463 --> 00:54:27,465
Brian put him there.

655
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:29,429
All right, so this is the
break we were looking for.

656
00:54:29,592 --> 00:54:31,845
If the two of them
were working together,

657
00:54:31,927 --> 00:54:33,429
Braga will know
what Shaw's up to.

658
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:34,889
I'm going to pay him a visit.

659
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:36,599
Are you serious right now?

660
00:54:36,974 --> 00:54:39,147
Think about what
you're saying.

661
00:54:39,435 --> 00:54:40,937
You're wanted, Brian.

662
00:54:41,437 --> 00:54:44,941
The moment you step foot off
that plane, it's a wrap.

663
00:54:45,441 --> 00:54:46,613
You're not coming back.

664
00:54:46,776 --> 00:54:49,120
"Coming back"? How are you
going to get in the country?

665
00:54:49,278 --> 00:54:51,155
Let me worry about that.

666
00:54:58,788 --> 00:55:00,461
This is on me.

667
00:55:01,624 --> 00:55:03,968
I'm the one that served
her up to Braga.

668
00:55:04,794 --> 00:55:07,798
I'm the one that gets
to make it right.

669
00:55:10,382 --> 00:55:12,225
Let me make it right.

670
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:15,642
Be careful.

671
00:55:23,062 --> 00:55:24,982
He's ready to see you now.
Right this way.

672
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,823
Thank you for seeing us. I won't
take up much of your time.

673
00:55:30,986 --> 00:55:32,579
My men were attacked
earlier today.

674
00:55:32,738 --> 00:55:34,160
I'm going to need
to see all cameras

675
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,663
in and around
Waterloo station.

676
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:39,374
Will somebody tell
Captain America here

677
00:55:39,495 --> 00:55:41,338
that requires clearance?

678
00:55:45,543 --> 00:55:46,840
Terry.

679
00:55:47,586 --> 00:55:51,181
Bring up cameras 58 through
62, earlier today.

680
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,388
They've been down for
maintenance all morning.

681
00:55:57,096 --> 00:55:58,188
Sorry.

682
00:55:58,514 --> 00:56:01,609
Okay. Well, we appreciate your help.
Thank you.

683
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:08,153
You know what I find
very interesting

684
00:56:08,315 --> 00:56:11,114
is Interpol was attacked
recently as well.

685
00:56:11,277 --> 00:56:13,496
Those cameras were down, too.
Didn't catch a thing.

686
00:56:13,988 --> 00:56:15,114
Nothing.

687
00:56:15,573 --> 00:56:17,200
Now, that means either
one of two things.

688
00:56:17,283 --> 00:56:18,751
Either means that your
maintenance schedule here

689
00:56:18,868 --> 00:56:20,962
aligns perfectly with
their escape route

690
00:56:21,036 --> 00:56:23,630
or it means that someone
here is working with them.

691
00:56:23,998 --> 00:56:26,592
And that's just ridiculous.

692
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:27,717
Because there ain't
no way in hell

693
00:56:27,793 --> 00:56:30,171
anybody here would
be working for them.

694
00:56:30,462 --> 00:56:31,823
Particularly you,
ain't that right?

695
00:56:32,006 --> 00:56:34,008
No, no, that's ridiculous.

696
00:56:34,174 --> 00:56:35,642
That is ridiculous.

697
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:38,600
I'm going to need direct
access to your live feed

698
00:56:38,679 --> 00:56:39,726
citywide.

699
00:56:39,847 --> 00:56:43,147
And I also strongly suggest
that you put a hold on any more

700
00:56:43,309 --> 00:56:44,481
"maintenance."

701
00:56:44,643 --> 00:56:46,486
Yeah, of course.

702
00:56:46,812 --> 00:56:48,985
We appreciate your help.
Thank you so much.

703
00:57:07,666 --> 00:57:10,010
Well, well, well.

704
00:57:10,169 --> 00:57:12,342
The orange in that really
makes your eyes pop.

705
00:57:19,345 --> 00:57:21,063
Thanks, fellas.

706
00:57:21,221 --> 00:57:22,848
Tell me something, O'Conner,

707
00:57:23,015 --> 00:57:24,858
how is it you keep running
around the world,

708
00:57:24,934 --> 00:57:26,184
breaking every law
known to man,

709
00:57:26,185 --> 00:57:28,904
and yet here I am, putting
my job on the line for you?

710
00:57:29,229 --> 00:57:32,028
You'll feel a lot better once you get
the credit for taking down Shaw.

711
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,902
Oh, I'm tempted to
settle for you.

712
00:57:35,527 --> 00:57:37,575
Well, you know what
they say, Stasiak,

713
00:57:37,738 --> 00:57:39,364
if you want the
career-changing big fish,

714
00:57:39,365 --> 00:57:41,038
you got to be willing to
put on the big boy panties

715
00:57:41,116 --> 00:57:43,210
and sail out to
the deep water.

716
00:57:43,369 --> 00:57:44,871
You're an asshole,
you know that'?

717
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:52,549
I missed you, too, man.
I really missed you.

718
00:57:54,213 --> 00:57:57,215
I got you admitted into Victor-ville
to do whatever you got to do.

719
00:57:57,216 --> 00:57:58,763
It's a 24-hour hold.

720
00:57:58,926 --> 00:58:00,599
You need to be out of
there by 9:00 A.M.

721
00:58:00,761 --> 00:58:04,106
That's when Forensics will run your
fingerprints through the national database.

722
00:58:04,264 --> 00:58:06,062
That program will match you

723
00:58:06,225 --> 00:58:07,943
and when they find out
who you really are,

724
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,733
I won't be able to
get you back out.

725
00:58:10,396 --> 00:58:11,943
We're talking life in prison.

726
00:58:19,571 --> 00:58:20,743
Cute kid.

727
00:58:24,743 --> 00:58:29,249
So, I found out Braga's being
held in cell block D3.

728
00:58:29,415 --> 00:58:30,462
That's solitary.

729
00:58:30,624 --> 00:58:33,093
I only had enough juice
to get you in Gen Pop.

730
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:36,760
So you're going to have to do
something to get his attention.

731
00:58:37,756 --> 00:58:38,757
Sorry about this, man.

732
00:58:38,841 --> 00:58:39,933
Sorry about what?

733
00:58:50,978 --> 00:58:52,480
Again?

734
00:59:00,654 --> 00:59:03,123
Big Brother's
about to go live.

735
00:59:07,661 --> 00:59:10,665
Damn, you can't flick a booger in
London without somebody noticing.

736
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,134
Hey! Don't touch that. That's
nothing to play with, man.

737
00:59:17,296 --> 00:59:18,343
What's the problem?

738
00:59:18,464 --> 00:59:20,512
That's high-tensile
titanium cable.

739
00:59:20,966 --> 00:59:22,058
What does that mean?

740
00:59:22,134 --> 00:59:24,136
That's what they use to anchor
buildings and hold up Bridges,

741
00:59:24,303 --> 00:59:26,305
stuff you know nothing about!

742
00:59:26,472 --> 00:59:28,975
See, now, their
version, it works cool,

743
00:59:29,141 --> 00:59:32,190
but mine, masterpiece.

744
00:59:32,352 --> 00:59:35,196
See, I reversed the
gears, torqued the motor

745
00:59:35,647 --> 00:59:37,524
and added this
tank to the back.

746
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:39,367
That makes it even sweeter.

747
00:59:39,526 --> 00:59:40,573
It does.

748
00:59:40,652 --> 00:59:41,869
It's not dummy-proof.

749
00:59:42,029 --> 00:59:44,157
Man, I've been known to
handle big guns. Relax.

750
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:46,490
You've been known to
handle that big-ass head.

751
00:59:46,575 --> 00:59:49,249
Dom, I did some
checking, asked around,

752
00:59:49,411 --> 00:59:51,288
got the location of a
street race tonight.

753
00:59:52,623 --> 00:59:55,172
Four speed Camaro
SS big block.

754
00:59:56,293 --> 00:59:57,340
You like it?

755
00:59:58,003 --> 00:59:59,004
Nice color.

756
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:50,222
Brian O'Conner.

757
01:00:50,389 --> 01:00:52,517
That was quite an entrance.

758
01:00:58,689 --> 01:01:00,737
You put a lot of
these men in here.

759
01:01:01,191 --> 01:01:04,035
What? You didn't think
one would recognize you?

760
01:01:06,738 --> 01:01:09,582
I've kept tabs on
you, you know.

761
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,544
You've been having a
lot of fun out there.

762
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:16,378
Good cop gone bad,
Rio de Janeiro.

763
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,884
It's exciting when you
go criminal, isn't it?

764
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:22,091
Too bad you didn't do it earlier,
you could have worked for me.

765
01:01:22,254 --> 01:01:23,881
Like Letty Ortiz?

766
01:01:26,091 --> 01:01:28,093
So tell me something,
because I buried her.

767
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,887
Yeah? You did?

768
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:32,727
You buried something, I couldn't
tell you who or what it was.

769
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:36,230
I know she's running
with Owen Shaw.

770
01:01:37,561 --> 01:01:39,563
Still playing cop, huh?

771
01:01:40,397 --> 01:01:42,820
Trust me, this is way
above your pay grade.

772
01:01:44,735 --> 01:01:45,952
Humor me, please.

773
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:50,574
Well, you're a dead man
walking, what does it matter'?

774
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:53,918
I ran everything for Shaw.

775
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:57,581
Drugs, guns, money, women.

776
01:01:57,748 --> 01:02:00,592
He taught me to think global
when I was just local.

777
01:02:00,751 --> 01:02:02,253
He made me a wealthy man.

778
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:04,467
And this guy didn't just have
the cartels working for him.

779
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:09,261
He had the CIA, DEA,
everyone in his pocket.

780
01:02:09,426 --> 01:02:11,599
He knew what was going to
happen before they did.

781
01:02:11,762 --> 01:02:16,268
In fact, he even knew when some
wet-behind-the-ears FBI agent

782
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:19,482
decided to put some
informant in my cartel.

783
01:02:32,699 --> 01:02:35,327
The minute you put Letty
undercover, she was dead, bro.

784
01:03:13,991 --> 01:03:15,493
But she survived.

785
01:03:15,826 --> 01:03:17,499
That girl is one tough bitch.

786
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:20,334
Shaw found her in a
hospital two days later.

787
01:03:20,497 --> 01:03:22,716
He went to finish the job.

788
01:03:22,874 --> 01:03:24,876
And he didn't kill her. Why?

789
01:03:25,669 --> 01:03:27,671
She had no memory.

790
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:30,348
Perfect girl, huh?

791
01:03:32,342 --> 01:03:34,470
You're lucky this
door's between us.

792
01:03:40,809 --> 01:03:43,153
What happened to Letty
is on your head.

793
01:04:28,357 --> 01:04:30,325
Look at me! Look at me.

794
01:04:31,693 --> 01:04:33,491
You won't do it.

795
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:36,740
What is Shaw up to?

796
01:04:36,907 --> 01:04:39,831
How do you think he knows your
next move before you make it?

797
01:04:39,993 --> 01:04:41,586
He's got eyes on you.

798
01:04:41,745 --> 01:04:43,338
Think about it.

799
01:04:47,542 --> 01:04:49,965
The only way you
get close to Shaw

800
01:04:50,128 --> 01:04:51,675
is if he wants you there.

801
01:06:35,901 --> 01:06:37,903
You've got some
serious balls, man.

802
01:06:38,236 --> 01:06:39,613
I've been told.

803
01:06:40,572 --> 01:06:42,495
You know, you're lucky
I missed my shot.

804
01:06:43,283 --> 01:06:44,660
I think you hit your mark.

805
01:06:44,826 --> 01:06:46,078
Really?

806
01:06:46,953 --> 01:06:48,079
What is it with you?

807
01:06:48,246 --> 01:06:50,089
Do you got a death
wish or something?

808
01:06:50,248 --> 01:06:51,921
If that's what it takes.

809
01:06:52,083 --> 01:06:53,960
I just want to race.

810
01:06:55,337 --> 01:06:56,805
You might lose your car.

811
01:07:00,842 --> 01:07:02,344
Let's do it.

812
01:07:02,761 --> 01:07:04,604
Your funeral.

813
01:07:05,263 --> 01:07:07,436
Ride or die, remember?

814
01:07:16,107 --> 01:07:17,279
Listen up!

815
01:07:17,984 --> 01:07:20,487
Out here, we're used to
getting what we want.

816
01:07:20,654 --> 01:07:22,998
This is London, baby.

817
01:07:23,365 --> 01:07:24,867
But remember,

818
01:07:25,617 --> 01:07:28,040
don't bite the bait.

819
01:07:28,203 --> 01:07:29,830
Are you ready'?

820
01:07:30,789 --> 01:07:32,336
Ready? Ready.

821
01:07:36,002 --> 01:07:37,345
Steady.

822
01:07:40,966 --> 01:07:42,013
Go!

823
01:08:33,685 --> 01:08:35,028
Just like old times.

824
01:09:23,234 --> 01:09:24,235
This guy is crazy.

825
01:10:03,983 --> 01:10:05,326
You got to be kidding me.

826
01:10:35,974 --> 01:10:37,476
You're still
up-shifting early.

827
01:10:37,642 --> 01:10:40,065
I do that so you brake.

828
01:10:40,979 --> 01:10:44,074
You lose traction and
the back end kicks out.

829
01:10:44,983 --> 01:10:45,984
I noticed.

830
01:10:47,569 --> 01:10:51,494
Look, just because you know how I
ride, doesn't mean you know me.

831
01:10:52,574 --> 01:10:54,417
You know what they say
where we're from?

832
01:10:55,744 --> 01:10:58,167
Show me how you drive,
I'll show you who you are.

833
01:11:00,165 --> 01:11:01,667
V8.

834
01:11:02,667 --> 01:11:05,170
You never could resist
American muscle.

835
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:10,683
Nice scar.

836
01:11:15,847 --> 01:11:19,021
You never could keep yourself
out of trouble, either.

837
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,022
What else do you
know about me?

838
01:11:25,023 --> 01:11:26,525
About you?

839
01:11:29,027 --> 01:11:30,529
Everything.

840
01:11:37,368 --> 01:11:39,541
Like this scar.

841
01:11:39,704 --> 01:11:43,299
You got that the first night we met.
You were 15.

842
01:11:43,458 --> 01:11:45,711
First street race.

843
01:11:46,544 --> 01:11:50,469
Some kid trying to show off
lost control of his car,

844
01:11:50,632 --> 01:11:53,226
wiped out right next to you.

845
01:11:53,384 --> 01:11:55,728
You're lucky you
didn't lose your arm.

846
01:11:55,887 --> 01:11:57,309
And let me guess,

847
01:11:58,056 --> 01:11:59,899
you saved me.

848
01:12:00,058 --> 01:12:01,560
No.

849
01:12:02,227 --> 01:12:04,400
I was the kid showing off.

850
01:12:07,565 --> 01:12:08,908
And here...

851
01:12:15,406 --> 01:12:17,249
Boyle Heights.

852
01:12:18,243 --> 01:12:22,339
You were fleeing with my little sister
Mia and got trapped in a corner.

853
01:12:23,331 --> 01:12:25,754
And you thought it
was a good idea

854
01:12:25,917 --> 01:12:29,592
to ride your Torino Cobra
through a retaining wall.

855
01:12:32,257 --> 01:12:36,012
All right, how about this one?

856
01:12:39,597 --> 01:12:42,771
That's the last time
we were together.

857
01:12:44,269 --> 01:12:46,271
In the Dr.

858
01:12:47,272 --> 01:12:49,866
You wanted to go
for a night swim.

859
01:12:51,192 --> 01:12:53,445
You cut yourself on the reef.

860
01:12:53,611 --> 01:12:55,534
I followed you.

861
01:12:57,282 --> 01:13:00,126
I even got this scar to match.

862
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:04,793
Look, I don't know
why you're here,

863
01:13:04,956 --> 01:13:07,800
but I really think
you're over your head.

864
01:13:16,217 --> 01:13:18,311
I'm here for you.

865
01:13:22,515 --> 01:13:24,609
That girl you remember,

866
01:13:26,436 --> 01:13:28,109
it's not me.

867
01:13:29,731 --> 01:13:32,359
Not from what I just saw.

868
01:13:34,569 --> 01:13:36,242
Like it or not,

869
01:13:38,406 --> 01:13:40,079
you're still the same girl.

870
01:13:43,286 --> 01:13:45,584
I saw it out there.

871
01:13:47,248 --> 01:13:49,421
I see it right now.

872
01:13:52,253 --> 01:13:53,300
I got to go.

873
01:13:55,548 --> 01:13:57,425
Hey.

874
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:09,483
It belongs to you.

875
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:45,682
There she goes,

876
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:47,316
leaving you again.

877
01:14:49,435 --> 01:14:51,278
Bloody fickle, that one.

878
01:14:52,438 --> 01:14:54,532
You want bloody'?
We could do bloody.

879
01:14:58,027 --> 01:14:59,529
A street kid,

880
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:03,329
starts out stealing DVD
players in East L.A.,

881
01:15:04,993 --> 01:15:08,372
ends up heisting
$100 million in Rio.

882
01:15:08,705 --> 01:15:10,207
Not bad, huh?

883
01:15:10,373 --> 01:15:12,375
It's a good story, isn't it?

884
01:15:13,543 --> 01:15:15,386
Almost inspiring.

885
01:15:16,713 --> 01:15:19,182
See, what I couldn't fathom is

886
01:15:19,632 --> 01:15:21,805
why he's not relaxing
on a beach somewhere

887
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:24,387
with that cute little
Brazilian number.

888
01:15:25,346 --> 01:15:30,352
Instead, he's working with a two-bit
government hack like Hobbs.

889
01:15:33,062 --> 01:15:34,860
And then I realized,

890
01:15:37,316 --> 01:15:38,909
he has a weak spot.

891
01:15:40,653 --> 01:15:43,076
We all got a weak spot.

892
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:45,158
You know,

893
01:15:45,742 --> 01:15:49,838
when I was young, my brother
always used to say,

894
01:15:49,996 --> 01:15:52,545
"Every man has
to have a code."

895
01:15:53,499 --> 01:15:54,751
Mine?

896
01:15:55,251 --> 01:15:56,719
Precision.

897
01:15:58,046 --> 01:16:01,926
A team is nothing but pieces you
switch out until you get the job done.

898
01:16:02,091 --> 01:16:03,343
It's efficient.

899
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:05,223
It works.

900
01:16:06,262 --> 01:16:07,559
But you?

901
01:16:10,099 --> 01:16:11,942
You're loyal to a fault.

902
01:16:12,685 --> 01:16:15,029
Your code is about family.

903
01:16:16,314 --> 01:16:19,818
And that's great in the holidays,
but it makes you predictable.

904
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:22,445
And in our line of work,
predictable means vulnerable.

905
01:16:22,612 --> 01:16:26,207
And that means I can reach out
and break you whenever I want.

906
01:16:26,574 --> 01:16:29,418
At least when I go, I'll
know what it's for.

907
01:16:30,953 --> 01:16:32,296
Well,

908
01:16:33,372 --> 01:16:35,295
at least you have a code.

909
01:16:37,794 --> 01:16:39,137
Most men don't.

910
01:16:43,132 --> 01:16:44,429
So.

911
01:16:45,635 --> 01:16:47,433
I'm going to give
you a chance.

912
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:51,065
Take your crew and walk away.

913
01:16:51,224 --> 01:16:53,818
That's the only way you're going
to keep your family safe.

914
01:16:56,437 --> 01:16:59,316
Your brother never told you never
to threaten a man's family?

915
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:03,403
It's a pretty
stupid thing to do.

916
01:17:05,571 --> 01:17:07,994
But I'll make it
simple for you.

917
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:12,329
I walk away when
she walks away.

918
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:15,082
Well, then,

919
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:20,136
it appears this inspiring
tale has come to an end.

920
01:17:28,177 --> 01:17:29,850
If that's the way
it has to go.

921
01:17:36,936 --> 01:17:38,938
Let me guess...

922
01:17:40,273 --> 01:17:41,320
Hobbs.

923
01:17:44,694 --> 01:17:47,288
Come on, you son of a bitch.

924
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:49,998
The "two-bit government hack."

925
01:17:57,373 --> 01:17:59,046
See you around, Toretto.

926
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:00,710
You can bet on it.

927
01:18:15,474 --> 01:18:18,569
Riley, Shaw's leaving
Batter-sea, heading southeast.

928
01:18:18,728 --> 01:18:20,401
Have Tej track him on
his live feed. Go.

929
01:18:22,023 --> 01:18:23,070
You know what would
have happened

930
01:18:23,149 --> 01:18:25,777
if I didn't put that
tracker in your car?

931
01:18:28,154 --> 01:18:29,326
This one?

932
01:18:36,662 --> 01:18:40,587
You know, this just got me
one step closer to Shaw.

933
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,926
For what it's worth, Toretto,

934
01:18:43,336 --> 01:18:46,089
I hope it gets you closer
to what you want, too.

935
01:19:02,104 --> 01:19:03,947
This better have
been worth it.

936
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,408
More than you'll ever know.

937
01:19:53,281 --> 01:19:54,498
Pretty.

938
01:19:59,287 --> 01:20:00,459
May I?

939
01:20:14,385 --> 01:20:17,138
I'm going to ask you
a question, Letty,

940
01:20:18,014 --> 01:20:21,894
and I want you to think very
hard before you answer.

941
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:24,859
When I give you the order

942
01:20:25,021 --> 01:20:26,443
to take Toretto out,

943
01:20:29,025 --> 01:20:31,448
what will your
first thought be?

944
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:35,782
Why don't you look
me in the eye

945
01:20:36,907 --> 01:20:40,707
and you tell me what you see.

946
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:50,967
Keep it.

947
01:21:00,848 --> 01:21:02,850
Tej, talk to me,
what have we got?

948
01:21:03,017 --> 01:21:05,361
We were able to track Shaw
after he left you and Dom,

949
01:21:05,519 --> 01:21:08,147
but this guy's smart, so we
could only track him so far.

950
01:21:08,314 --> 01:21:10,692
He seems to know all the
city's blind spots.

951
01:21:10,858 --> 01:21:12,219
See, we lost him
somewhere in here,

952
01:21:12,318 --> 01:21:13,568
which means he
could be anywhere

953
01:21:13,569 --> 01:21:15,287
within that
half-a-mile radius.

954
01:21:15,446 --> 01:21:18,370
Maybe if we cross-reference
phone records, leases...

955
01:21:18,532 --> 01:21:20,580
No, this has got Shaw's
name written all over it.

956
01:21:20,743 --> 01:21:22,871
We've got vantage
points, multiple exits,

957
01:21:22,953 --> 01:21:24,500
subways, highways
and storm drains.

958
01:21:24,663 --> 01:21:26,165
Bad-ass and brains.

959
01:21:26,332 --> 01:21:28,452
Woman, you keep that up, I'm
going to be out of a job.

960
01:21:28,709 --> 01:21:31,303
All right, let's go nail
that son of a bitch.

961
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:56,158
They're long gone.

962
01:21:56,695 --> 01:21:58,789
There's nothing here.

963
01:22:06,956 --> 01:22:08,424
There's never nothing.

964
01:22:16,424 --> 01:22:18,552
There's always something.

965
01:22:24,849 --> 01:22:26,351
Let's go, guys.

966
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:32,236
Shaw, everyone is in place. All
things moving according to plan.

967
01:22:35,443 --> 01:22:37,445
Good. Send him in.

968
01:22:40,739 --> 01:22:42,707
Yo, it's Hobbs.

969
01:22:44,118 --> 01:22:46,371
What have you got, Parker?
Give me something good.

970
01:22:46,537 --> 01:22:50,132
Yeah, that paint you got from
Shaw's place is highly specialized.

971
01:22:50,291 --> 01:22:52,464
Anti-thermal low-IR coating.

972
01:22:52,626 --> 01:22:54,594
Military. Exactly.

973
01:22:54,753 --> 01:22:57,427
We got a list of bases around
Europe that use this paint type

974
01:22:57,590 --> 01:22:58,762
and those specific colors.

975
01:22:58,924 --> 01:23:00,267
All right, let's
cross-reference that

976
01:23:00,342 --> 01:23:02,140
with all of Shaw's
military targets.

977
01:23:02,303 --> 01:23:04,601
I guaran-damn-tee you one
of them is gonna match.

978
01:23:05,973 --> 01:23:09,318
Bingo. It's a NATO
base in Spain.

979
01:23:09,477 --> 01:23:10,957
That puts Shaw in a
different country.

980
01:23:11,395 --> 01:23:12,897
That means he's got an
eight-hour lead on us.

981
01:23:13,063 --> 01:23:15,236
We gotta move now. Tej,
give me that info.

982
01:23:15,566 --> 01:23:17,739
Riley and I will go ahead and we're
going to lock down the base.

983
01:23:17,902 --> 01:23:19,996
We're going to protect
that component personally.

984
01:23:20,154 --> 01:23:22,873
Toretto, I'll arrange transportation
for you and your cars.

985
01:23:23,032 --> 01:23:26,832
You brush up on your Spanish, boys.
I'll see you en España.

986
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:52,274
You son of a bitch!
You made it!

987
01:23:52,811 --> 01:23:54,154
What up, man? Good to see you.

988
01:23:54,313 --> 01:23:56,691
Good to see you. So,
what's going on here?

989
01:23:56,857 --> 01:23:58,655
Figured out they're hitting
an army base in Spain.

990
01:23:58,817 --> 01:24:01,491
Border patrol lD'ed Shaw's men
crossing through last night.

991
01:24:01,654 --> 01:24:03,748
Hobbs and Riley went
to lock down the base.

992
01:24:03,906 --> 01:24:05,328
- They're going to meet us there.
- Where's Dom?

993
01:24:05,491 --> 01:24:07,243
He wasn't going without you.

994
01:24:13,582 --> 01:24:15,630
I found out what
happened to Letty.

995
01:24:16,335 --> 01:24:18,383
It's all my fault.

996
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:20,506
Brian,

997
01:24:21,423 --> 01:24:24,768
whatever you found
out, that's for you.

998
01:24:25,344 --> 01:24:27,312
What we're about to do now

999
01:24:28,764 --> 01:24:30,607
is for her.

1000
01:24:34,019 --> 01:24:36,067
We've got four teams
on overwatch,

1001
01:24:36,230 --> 01:24:39,029
sniper-spotters in roosts north
and South of the target.

1002
01:24:39,191 --> 01:24:40,693
Just keep all your
men out of sight.

1003
01:24:40,776 --> 01:24:41,868
When they drive
that truck in here,

1004
01:24:41,944 --> 01:24:44,572
I want to come crashing down on
them like the walls of Jericho.

1005
01:24:44,738 --> 01:24:49,244
Hobbs, I just caught this one disabling
the perimeter security system.

1006
01:24:49,410 --> 01:24:51,629
Your house is compromised.
What are you suggesting?

1007
01:24:51,787 --> 01:24:52,834
I ain't suggesting.

1008
01:24:52,913 --> 01:24:55,132
We follow protocol, we
move the component out.

1009
01:24:55,291 --> 01:24:58,293
Shaw thinks it's here. We're going to
get it out of here before he arrives.

1010
01:24:58,294 --> 01:25:00,171
Stealth and speed are going
to be our two best friends.

1011
01:25:00,254 --> 01:25:02,427
We're going to protect our little
egg, move it out of the hen-house,

1012
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:05,844
then we're going to wait for
that goddamn fox to arrive.

1013
01:25:08,929 --> 01:25:11,728
I just got word they caught one
of Shaw's men at the base.

1014
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:13,016
It's time.

1015
01:25:13,183 --> 01:25:16,813
Something is not right. He
wanted us to find that guy.

1016
01:25:16,979 --> 01:25:19,858
Think about it. At Interpol, you
were face-to-face with him.

1017
01:25:20,608 --> 01:25:21,969
Brian, so what are you saying?

1018
01:25:22,359 --> 01:25:27,365
Braga said the only way you get
near Shaw is if he wants you to.

1019
01:25:28,032 --> 01:25:29,830
Tej, where's that component?

1020
01:25:30,242 --> 01:25:31,835
They're moving it to
a secure location.

1021
01:25:36,874 --> 01:25:38,547
Shaw ain't hitting that base.

1022
01:25:38,709 --> 01:25:39,926
He's hitting the convoy.

1023
01:26:15,412 --> 01:26:16,459
Let's go!

1024
01:26:45,192 --> 01:26:47,286
We've got a report, the
convoy's under attack.

1025
01:26:47,361 --> 01:26:48,408
Get a chopper, now!

1026
01:27:05,045 --> 01:27:07,468
Fellas, you better hurry up.
They just took the convoy.

1027
01:27:11,051 --> 01:27:12,394
And Dom,

1028
01:27:12,636 --> 01:27:14,138
Letty's with them.

1029
01:27:14,888 --> 01:27:17,232
We stick to the plan.

1030
01:27:23,897 --> 01:27:25,064
All right, you heard the man.

1031
01:27:25,065 --> 01:27:26,315
Let's play this
fast and clean.

1032
01:27:26,316 --> 01:27:27,516
That thing's heading your way.

1033
01:28:05,522 --> 01:28:06,694
All systems go.

1034
01:28:06,857 --> 01:28:08,859
Everything looks stable.

1035
01:28:09,526 --> 01:28:11,699
Uh, guys, we gotta come
up with another plan.

1036
01:28:15,032 --> 01:28:16,033
They got a tank.

1037
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:18,623
I'm sorry, did somebody
just say "a tank"?

1038
01:28:24,875 --> 01:28:26,127
We got company, guys.

1039
01:28:26,293 --> 01:28:28,546
Toretto is coming
right at you.

1040
01:28:28,712 --> 01:28:31,340
Okay. Get the weapons hot.

1041
01:28:32,883 --> 01:28:34,885
Give me satellite imaging.

1042
01:29:28,897 --> 01:29:30,695
Straight ahead of us.

1043
01:29:31,441 --> 01:29:32,909
There you are.

1044
01:29:47,749 --> 01:29:49,092
Who's got a plan B?

1045
01:29:49,251 --> 01:29:51,800
Plan B? We need
a plan C, D, E.

1046
01:29:51,962 --> 01:29:53,134
We need more alphabets!

1047
01:29:53,297 --> 01:29:56,426
Hey, we do what we do best.

1048
01:29:56,592 --> 01:29:58,060
We improvise, all right?

1049
01:30:14,318 --> 01:30:17,322
Okay, Jah. Take it
to the other side.

1050
01:30:17,487 --> 01:30:18,830
Let's have some fun.

1051
01:30:34,671 --> 01:30:37,265
What the hell is wrong with you?
This isn't part of the plan.

1052
01:30:49,978 --> 01:30:52,026
Take their attention
away from the people!

1053
01:31:05,202 --> 01:31:07,000
Shaw, you don't
have to do this.

1054
01:31:18,048 --> 01:31:19,721
We got one right
in front of us.

1055
01:31:20,050 --> 01:31:21,142
Boom.

1056
01:31:23,011 --> 01:31:24,058
Oh, shit!

1057
01:31:31,353 --> 01:31:32,730
You lucky bastard.

1058
01:31:33,855 --> 01:31:35,482
Roman, you hang in there.

1059
01:31:35,649 --> 01:31:37,242
Hang in there, man!

1060
01:31:40,654 --> 01:31:44,329
Somebody better do something!
I got a tank on my ass!

1061
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:48,253
There's gotta be a
break up ahead.

1062
01:31:52,749 --> 01:31:53,875
Oh, look,

1063
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:55,923
a bridge.

1064
01:32:26,074 --> 01:32:27,121
Screw it.

1065
01:32:58,273 --> 01:32:59,900
Yeah!

1066
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:05,163
We're dragging a
car behind us.

1067
01:33:06,615 --> 01:33:09,289
Brian, that Mustang would
make a nice anchor.

1068
01:33:09,451 --> 01:33:10,623
Yeah, I'm on it.

1069
01:33:35,852 --> 01:33:36,853
Damn!

1070
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:38,772
Shaw, we've got to
get rid of that car.

1071
01:33:38,939 --> 01:33:41,488
Letty, go take
care of the cable.

1072
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,132
Yeah!

1073
01:34:00,877 --> 01:34:02,220
What's she doing?

1074
01:34:02,379 --> 01:34:03,551
Shit!

1075
01:34:04,422 --> 01:34:05,890
Okay, Toretto.

1076
01:34:08,677 --> 01:34:09,724
Here's your girl...

1077
01:34:12,848 --> 01:34:14,441
And your happy ending.

1078
01:34:14,599 --> 01:34:15,771
Letty!

1079
01:34:51,094 --> 01:34:53,597
Jesus Christ.

1080
01:35:01,062 --> 01:35:03,156
I can't believe they
stole a 70-ton tank

1081
01:35:03,273 --> 01:35:04,570
for a three-ounce
computer chip.

1082
01:35:04,733 --> 01:35:08,613
That 3-ounce computer chip is more
deadly than 1,000 of those tanks.

1083
01:35:12,157 --> 01:35:13,784
What about her?

1084
01:35:14,284 --> 01:35:15,957
Not her.

1085
01:35:16,119 --> 01:35:17,587
She was working with Shaw.

1086
01:35:17,746 --> 01:35:18,838
Was,

1087
01:35:20,957 --> 01:35:22,959
but she's always
been one of us.

1088
01:35:26,087 --> 01:35:28,010
Let's give them a minute.

1089
01:35:41,853 --> 01:35:43,821
Let's go process
Shaw and his crew.

1090
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:47,154
I've never looked more forward to
filling out paperwork in my life.

1091
01:36:03,875 --> 01:36:05,172
Hey.

1092
01:36:08,505 --> 01:36:11,850
Look, I don't even know
how to say this to you,

1093
01:36:16,554 --> 01:36:18,852
but everything that's happened
here is because of me.

1094
01:36:19,516 --> 01:36:21,016
I'm the one that put
you undercover...

1095
01:36:21,017 --> 01:36:22,690
Stop.

1096
01:36:23,687 --> 01:36:25,360
I may not remember anything,

1097
01:36:26,690 --> 01:36:29,409
but I know one thing
about myself.

1098
01:36:29,693 --> 01:36:32,913
Nobody makes me do
anything I don't want to.

1099
01:36:45,375 --> 01:36:48,504
So, what's our next
adventure after this?

1100
01:36:50,422 --> 01:36:54,097
How about we stay
in one place?

1101
01:36:55,051 --> 01:36:56,223
Where are you thinking?

1102
01:36:56,386 --> 01:36:57,888
Tokyo.

1103
01:36:58,513 --> 01:37:00,891
We always talk about Tokyo.

1104
01:37:02,225 --> 01:37:04,603
Tokyo it is.

1105
01:37:11,026 --> 01:37:13,745
Can I ask you something?

1106
01:37:21,786 --> 01:37:26,041
How did you know that there would
be a car there to break our fall?

1107
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:28,252
I didn't.

1108
01:37:32,213 --> 01:37:35,808
Some things you just
have to take on faith.

1109
01:37:37,469 --> 01:37:38,891
Hey, Toretto!

1110
01:37:54,611 --> 01:37:57,615
You guys really
think you've won.

1111
01:37:58,615 --> 01:38:00,242
This code you live by,

1112
01:38:01,117 --> 01:38:04,291
it's the very reason why you
weren't even in the game.

1113
01:38:06,956 --> 01:38:10,301
I told you exactly what I was gonna
do if you didn't walk away, Toretto.

1114
01:38:11,336 --> 01:38:12,428
Go!

1115
01:38:13,254 --> 01:38:14,801
But you didn't listen.

1116
01:38:15,632 --> 01:38:19,853
I told you I can reach out and
break you whenever I want.

1117
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:24,057
And I have.

1118
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:25,266
Come on.

1119
01:38:28,311 --> 01:38:29,528
Go. No!

1120
01:38:29,687 --> 01:38:31,860
Maybe you should call Mia.

1121
01:38:45,537 --> 01:38:47,039
Mia? Brian!

1122
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:51,843
Let me go!

1123
01:39:05,140 --> 01:39:07,859
So, this is how
it's gonna go down.

1124
01:39:08,393 --> 01:39:10,361
You're gonna cut me
loose from these cuffs,

1125
01:39:10,812 --> 01:39:12,064
you're gonna hand me the chip,

1126
01:39:12,230 --> 01:39:14,398
I'm gonna walk out of here
and you're not gonna follow.

1127
01:39:14,399 --> 01:39:16,572
You must be joking.

1128
01:39:20,572 --> 01:39:21,824
Look at his face.

1129
01:39:25,827 --> 01:39:27,204
Ask him if I'm joking.

1130
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:32,092
One hostage does not outweigh
the threat to millions.

1131
01:39:33,168 --> 01:39:36,923
I'm sorry, but this
changes nothing.

1132
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:43,353
It changes everything.

1133
01:39:44,721 --> 01:39:47,440
You tell your men
to stand down.

1134
01:39:50,226 --> 01:39:52,069
Stand down.

1135
01:39:54,355 --> 01:39:55,402
Toretto,

1136
01:39:56,399 --> 01:39:57,616
I need you to know,

1137
01:39:57,901 --> 01:40:01,371
the moment we let him walk out
that door with that chip,

1138
01:40:01,529 --> 01:40:04,578
words like "amnesty"
and "pardon"

1139
01:40:04,741 --> 01:40:06,414
walk outwith him.

1140
01:40:12,081 --> 01:40:15,927
Those words went out
the day we were born.

1141
01:40:45,281 --> 01:40:46,954
Coming, babe?

1142
01:40:52,455 --> 01:40:53,798
Of course.

1143
01:40:55,625 --> 01:40:57,298
I wouldn't miss
it for the world.

1144
01:41:01,130 --> 01:41:02,803
Like I said,

1145
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:06,644
you were never in the game.

1146
01:41:07,387 --> 01:41:11,483
If I see you on the horizon, I'll
make the call and the girl's dead.

1147
01:41:24,654 --> 01:41:26,748
So, what about
Toretto's sister?

1148
01:41:28,575 --> 01:41:30,327
There's no need
for her anymore.

1149
01:41:35,832 --> 01:41:38,756
I just jammed every signal
up and down the spectrum.

1150
01:41:41,004 --> 01:41:42,677
Let's move.

1151
01:41:42,839 --> 01:41:45,183
I'm coming with you.

1152
01:42:18,291 --> 01:42:20,214
Where the hell does this
dude think he's going?

1153
01:42:20,376 --> 01:42:22,219
We're on an army
base, he's trapped.

1154
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:32,973
Wow, you just had
to open your mouth.

1155
01:42:33,264 --> 01:42:35,266
Now we got a big-ass
plane to deal with.

1156
01:42:35,433 --> 01:42:37,606
That ain't a plane.
That's a planet.

1157
01:42:54,577 --> 01:42:58,423
She's as good as dead if Shaw
gets away on that plane.

1158
01:43:02,168 --> 01:43:04,091
Then we don't let
him get away.

1159
01:43:11,761 --> 01:43:13,934
Let's end this thing.

1160
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:23,732
Ride or die.

1161
01:43:24,816 --> 01:43:25,908
Ride or die.

1162
01:44:51,527 --> 01:44:52,904
Tell them to take off!

1163
01:45:03,748 --> 01:45:05,045
Babe, get me under the wing.

1164
01:45:05,208 --> 01:45:07,711
If I can hit that flap, we
can keep it from taking off.

1165
01:45:12,715 --> 01:45:13,887
You be careful.

1166
01:45:14,884 --> 01:45:16,727
This is who we are.

1167
01:45:28,898 --> 01:45:29,899
Shit!

1168
01:45:33,569 --> 01:45:34,570
Grab the wheel!

1169
01:46:24,412 --> 01:46:25,459
Dom!

1170
01:46:32,670 --> 01:46:33,762
Go!

1171
01:46:33,963 --> 01:46:35,260
Come on. Let's go.

1172
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:52,606
Get in the car.

1173
01:48:26,325 --> 01:48:27,326
Whoo!

1174
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:04,677
What happened? Did
you hit the flap?

1175
01:50:05,299 --> 01:50:06,300
Uh...

1176
01:50:06,967 --> 01:50:08,344
You should buckle
up right now.

1177
01:50:08,469 --> 01:50:09,516
What?

1178
01:50:25,361 --> 01:50:26,453
Hey!

1179
01:50:30,533 --> 01:50:31,659
Wrong team, bitch.

1180
01:51:16,412 --> 01:51:17,413
Shit.

1181
01:51:38,475 --> 01:51:39,476
Yeah!

1182
01:51:55,826 --> 01:51:57,169
I got you.

1183
01:53:05,479 --> 01:53:06,571
Tej!

1184
01:53:06,981 --> 01:53:08,073
Keep her steady!

1185
01:53:08,732 --> 01:53:10,655
We gotta move, it's going down!
Go!

1186
01:53:15,364 --> 01:53:17,082
Go, now!

1187
01:53:20,369 --> 01:53:22,337
Come on, let's
move, move, move!

1188
01:53:28,585 --> 01:53:29,586
Come on!

1189
01:53:33,674 --> 01:53:35,017
Dom!

1190
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:41,737
Where's Gisele?

1191
01:56:45,741 --> 01:56:47,584
Where's Gisele?

1192
01:57:16,647 --> 01:57:19,742
So this is worth
billions, huh?

1193
01:57:24,279 --> 01:57:25,656
Yes, it is.

1194
01:57:30,452 --> 01:57:31,749
Name your price, Dom.

1195
01:57:36,667 --> 01:57:39,136
1327.

1196
01:58:05,112 --> 01:58:06,864
Don't burn it this time.
Please?

1197
01:58:07,030 --> 01:58:09,374
I never go and burn it, man.

1198
01:58:11,535 --> 01:58:13,128
Good food.

1199
01:58:13,620 --> 01:58:17,796
The air quality here is
lousy, the traffic is bad,

1200
01:58:18,542 --> 01:58:20,262
but I think you'll learn
to like this place.

1201
01:58:20,377 --> 01:58:22,880
Yeah, and here you've
got your own garage

1202
01:58:23,005 --> 01:58:24,973
so you can build a
car with Daddy.

1203
01:58:25,048 --> 01:58:26,140
We'll be building a car?

1204
01:58:26,216 --> 01:58:28,719
First car better be
a Charger, Jack.

1205
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:30,972
You mean Skyline.

1206
01:58:32,222 --> 01:58:34,395
Like I said, he's a Toretto.

1207
01:58:34,725 --> 01:58:36,068
You're confusing the kid.

1208
01:58:36,226 --> 01:58:37,398
Mia, you're gonna let
him get away with this?

1209
01:58:37,561 --> 01:58:38,983
You're really going to do it?

1210
01:58:39,813 --> 01:58:40,860
Tokyo.

1211
01:58:42,065 --> 01:58:44,739
Yeah, it's just
something I gotta do.

1212
01:58:44,901 --> 01:58:48,246
You know we got your back,
whenever you need us.

1213
01:58:52,326 --> 01:58:54,749
Hey, Mia, you better
hide your baby oil.

1214
01:58:54,828 --> 01:58:55,829
I'm just playing.

1215
01:58:55,912 --> 01:58:57,585
You better hide that
big-ass forehead.

1216
01:58:57,748 --> 01:58:59,000
I was just joking,
but whatever.

1217
01:58:59,499 --> 01:59:00,921
Definitely not that funny.

1218
01:59:01,084 --> 01:59:02,757
It's official.

1219
01:59:02,919 --> 01:59:04,091
You're all free.

1220
01:59:04,171 --> 01:59:05,548
Mmm. Mmm.

1221
01:59:08,091 --> 01:59:10,594
It wasn't half bad,
having you work for me.

1222
01:59:12,929 --> 01:59:15,273
We all know you were
working for me, Hobbs.

1223
01:59:15,932 --> 01:59:18,230
Agree to disagree.

1224
01:59:18,393 --> 01:59:19,440
Thank you.

1225
01:59:20,395 --> 01:59:21,612
Good luck.

1226
01:59:23,273 --> 01:59:24,274
Elena?

1227
01:59:24,441 --> 01:59:25,533
Letty.

1228
01:59:25,609 --> 01:59:27,611
This is gonna be awkward.

1229
01:59:28,111 --> 01:59:30,284
But sexy as hell.
Sexy as hell.

1230
01:59:30,947 --> 01:59:33,951
I wanted to thank you for
everything you've done for him.

1231
01:59:34,409 --> 01:59:35,752
For us.

1232
01:59:36,286 --> 01:59:38,288
It takes an amazing woman.

1233
01:59:40,248 --> 01:59:41,795
He's an amazing guy.

1234
01:59:42,459 --> 01:59:43,961
Yeah, he is.

1235
01:59:45,462 --> 01:59:47,760
Try to keep him out
of trouble, huh?

1236
01:59:49,132 --> 01:59:51,726
Now, you know that's
not gonna happen.

1237
01:59:52,636 --> 01:59:53,808
I know.

1238
01:59:56,765 --> 01:59:59,109
Not bad for a cop.

1239
02:00:06,692 --> 02:00:09,536
I never thought I'd
trust a criminal.

1240
02:00:12,197 --> 02:00:13,949
Until next time.

1241
02:00:14,533 --> 02:00:17,286
Until next time.

1242
02:00:23,709 --> 02:00:24,756
Elena.

1243
02:00:33,635 --> 02:00:35,057
You know you don't have to go.

1244
02:00:38,056 --> 02:00:41,526
All this... This
is your family.

1245
02:00:42,561 --> 02:00:44,404
It's who you are.

1246
02:00:44,813 --> 02:00:46,736
This is my family.

1247
02:00:49,067 --> 02:00:50,910
This is who I am.

1248
02:01:09,087 --> 02:01:10,527
All right, everybody,
let's eat.

1249
02:01:10,756 --> 02:01:12,006
Want some help with that?

1250
02:01:12,007 --> 02:01:13,554
It's all here, it's done.

1251
02:01:14,426 --> 02:01:16,770
Come on, man, let's
get with it.

1252
02:01:19,598 --> 02:01:21,271
First bite, he's got grace.

1253
02:01:21,433 --> 02:01:23,106
House rules, man. House rules.

1254
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:28,114
Any of this feel
familiar to you?

1255
02:01:32,235 --> 02:01:33,782
No.

1256
02:01:36,406 --> 02:01:38,534
But it feels like home.

1257
02:01:39,367 --> 02:01:40,710
That's good enough for me.

1258
02:01:41,495 --> 02:01:43,998
All right, y'all. Come
on, let's do this.

1259
02:01:44,873 --> 02:01:46,591
Okay, Roman,

1260
02:01:48,293 --> 02:01:50,091
bless our table.

1261
02:01:55,717 --> 02:01:58,971
Father, thank you for the
gathering of friends.

1262
02:01:59,137 --> 02:02:01,936
Father, we give thanks for
all the choices we've made,

1263
02:02:02,098 --> 02:02:04,692
because that's what
makes us who we are.

1264
02:02:04,851 --> 02:02:08,572
Let us forever cherish the loved
ones we've lost along the way.

1265
02:02:08,730 --> 02:02:10,277
Thank you for the
little angel,

1266
02:02:10,357 --> 02:02:12,325
the newest addition
to our family.

1267
02:02:12,484 --> 02:02:14,327
Thank you for
bringing Letty home.

1268
02:02:14,486 --> 02:02:18,161
And most of all, thank
you for fast cars.

1269
02:04:22,364 --> 02:04:24,583
Dominic Toretto.

1270
02:04:24,741 --> 02:04:25,993
You don't know me,

1271
02:04:27,827 --> 02:04:29,579
but you're about to.
