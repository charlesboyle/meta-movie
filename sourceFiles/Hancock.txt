00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,790
All units all units.
Code 3 pursuit of 2-11.

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,460
White SUV heading east
on Alameda service road.

4
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,000
Suspects: three Asian males.

5
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,760
Be advised. Shots
fired shots fired.

6
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,140
Cheryl can you see how many
suspects are in this car?

7
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,730
As far as I can see at this
point there are three sus...

8
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,610
Oh this is just coming in..

9
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,940
Hancock!

10
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,330
What boy?

11
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,670
Bad guys.

12
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,290
Trying to cut them off.
You can see them there.

13
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,630
They have their hands
outside the white SUV...

14
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,380
shooting randomly
on the freeway..

15
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,590
What you want a cookie?
Get out of my face.

16
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,760
Asshole.

17
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,770
- What?
- You heard me.

18
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,320
Please stay off the freeway.

19
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,110
I understand that there are three
suspects in the white SUV...

20
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,910
Asshole.

21
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,230
Watch out!

22
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,650
Damn!

23
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,240
Damn it!

24
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,350
Hancock!?!

25
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Beat it 'Soulja Boy!'

26
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,610
Hancock is in the car...

27
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,280
and he appears to be
negotiating with the gunmen..

28
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,820
He smells like a bar!

29
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,330
You pay for new roof!

30
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,330
Fellas hey. I don't give a shit
what you did. I don't care.

31
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,210
Three guys in the car
no girls rave music.

32
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,880
Hey I'm not gonna judge.

33
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,550
But if you don't pull over and
give yourselves up quietly...

34
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:25,180
I swear to Christ your head
is going up the driver's ass.

35
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,760
His head is going up your ass.
And you drew the short stick...

36
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,390
because your head
is going up my ass.

37
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,520
Shoot this asshole!

38
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,650
Stop!

39
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,950
What the FUCK?

40
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,340
The department is on their way.
There's just chaos here on the 105..

41
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,060
What? I'm not Japanese man!

42
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,270
Put us down!

43
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,730
Oh now you "speaky Engly" huh?
"Speaky Engly" now?

44
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,410
You broke my glasses.

45
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,830
I'm sorry! Take my Ray-Bans!

46
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,130
- Put us down!
- You want down?

47
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,750
- Yes please! Please!
- Help me!

48
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,380
I'm real good at down.
I'm real good at down.

49
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,880
All right? All right.

50
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,430
This Hancock's latest act
of so-called heroics...

51
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,690
took a hefty financial toll.

52
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:02,110
Initial damage estimates are
said to top $9 million...

53
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,480
which if accurate...

54
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,820
represents a
personal record...

55
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,200
for the notoriously
publicity-shy Hancock...

56
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,240
who as usual can't be
reached for comment.

57
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:18,250
With all the cracks to the concrete
all the bullets water damage fires...

58
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,000
L.A. would be better off
if this guy would leave...

59
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,840
and let us get on
with our jobs..

60
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,460
Hi.

61
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,460
Don't think I'm crazy okay? We've
looked everywhere for you.

62
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,300
Going to the Roxy and the
Viper Room and Jumbo's...

63
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,090
anywhere we thought you
would be at. I found you.

64
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,680
I got you.

65
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,600
So what's it like when you fly?

66
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,520
- No what? - I ain't
gonna fly you.

67
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,150
I got a cousin Narelle. She's my
best friend in the entire world...

68
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,610
and I swear to God she would not be
here today if it wasn't for you.

69
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,620
She crashed her car up in Malibu
when you flew her to the hospital.

70
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,280
Remember?

71
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,330
I will break my foot
off in your ass woman.

72
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,130
You got a car?

73
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,820
Hey want a drink?

74
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,910
So this is where you live.
This is your hideout.

75
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,660
Your Batcave.

76
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,660
Your Fortress of Solitude.

77
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,920
- It's a couple trailers I stuck together.
- What's all this?

78
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,750
- Jiffy Pop.
- Jiffy Pop.

79
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,550
- What do you do with it?
- Pop it.

80
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,720
- Jiffy Pop pop. I like that.
- Hey hey.

81
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,930
Hold on.

82
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,600
Want me to give you
something else to pop?

83
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,770
- I didn't catch your name.
- Pop this Superman.

84
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,440
Not much for the chitchat huh?
Let me set this over here.

85
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,650
- All right. Now there are some rules.
- Hello?

86
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,280
- No I know I haven't seen it yet.
- Excuse me.

87
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,450
I know probably. All
right all right.

88
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,530
- Let me call you back.
- Listen.

89
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,490
You're gonna need to focus.
All right I need you...

90
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,370
- Hey that's... That's not focusing.
- What's in there?

91
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,630
Okay all right hold on. Stop.
Stop it. All right now...

92
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,000
- ...when I get to the moment...
- The moment?

93
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,050
You know the... Start climbing
the mountaintop you know?

94
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,430
- You know... All right? Yes.
- Yeah.

95
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,260
You're gonna need to be as far
away from that as possible.

96
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,720
- Far. That's hot. - No
that's not hot. It's not hot.

97
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,140
- Oh yeah.
- Okay.

98
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,020
Hancock. Oh yeah.

99
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,110
- Now you're doing too much.
- Hancock.

100
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,400
Oh mountaintop! Mountaintop!

101
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,570
Mountaintop! Watch out!

102
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,390
Sorry.

103
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,270
That's not fair to anybody.

104
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,820
Thank you for being
okay with that.

105
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,950
- I know it's... - Can I
use the bathroom please?

106
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,410
Yeah. Hey you...? You
want some Jiffy Pop?

107
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,040
- No thanks. - It's
straight back.

108
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,540
- You all right?
- Yeah.

109
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,920
Yeah I was trying to tell you.

110
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,970
Hey...

111
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:49,140
Listen... You know if you
want I could fly you.

112
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,730
It's really beautiful you know?
Earth.

113
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,940
You could see the...

114
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,750
Might have to get you a helmet
so your face doesn't tear off.

115
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,580
What do you think?

116
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,540
Sir? Ray Embrey.

117
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,040
- Ray.
- Pleasure.

118
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,630
- So... - Ray's like
the Bono of P.R.

119
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,920
Well actually I think Bono is
the Bono of P.R. but I do try.

120
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,760
Well let's see it.

121
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,350
Okay. I'll get right into it.
Good morning everyone.

122
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,060
I'm here to talk to you
about charitable giving.

123
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,440
Okay? And we all know
the way that works.

124
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,400
You give one maybe two
percent of your net cash...

125
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,650
and you get an armband or a ribbon or
whatever. It's nowhere near enough.

126
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,660
And that's why we at Embrey Publicity
would like to offer you...

127
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,830
the AllHeart symbol.

128
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,620
Now you would be among a very
select group of corporate giants...

129
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,170
to bear this logo
on your product.

130
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,340
And what this would
say to the public...

131
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,420
is that your company
Pharmatopsis...

132
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:44,970
has made a radical contribution
to helping our world.

133
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,050
Here's all you need
to do to qualify.

134
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,140
Your new TB drug Mycodin?

135
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,440
We would like for you to give
that product away for free.

136
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,690
- Did you say "free"?
- I did.

137
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,740
Only to those who need it.

138
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,320
Only to those who without
it would otherwise die.

139
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:11,450
As a concept free is kind of up there
with you know lethal side effects.

140
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,120
- Mandatory product recall.
- Get indicted go to jail.

141
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,170
Get out work at IHOP for
the rest of your career.

142
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,750
Understandable reaction.
It's a radical concept.

143
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,260
But it is the brand that represents
a fairer and better world.

144
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,720
The brand...

145
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,510
that everyone is talking about.

146
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,600
Who is "everyone"?

147
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,390
We do already have a
sports franchise.

148
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,600
- NFL? NBA? MLB?
- Soccer.

149
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,190
MLS? Which team?

150
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,400
Well it's a local team.
Encino Hurricanes.

151
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,030
It's my son's team.

152
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:50,280
Anyway we can save the world.

153
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,790
All right? Someone's
just gotta go first.

154
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,410
What do you say?

155
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,630
Are you a crackpot?

156
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,310
Hey hon. You're probably at
the store. I am on my way.

157
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,810
I think I made a connection.

158
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,190
Not really.

159
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,810
Listen tell Aaron that I'm
coming and I... Damn it.

160
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,230
And I want some meatballs okay?

161
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,110
I need some Spaghetti Madness.
I'll see you in about 20 minutes.

162
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,820
Hey! What is it
National Horn Day?

163
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,530
Idiot.

164
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,960
Hey.

165
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,880
Hey. Hey!

166
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,210
Move it. There's a train coming.

167
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,630
Do you not hear that horn?

168
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,300
Let's go! I got a train!

169
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,260
Move it!

170
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,720
- Back your car up! There's a train!
- I can't go anywhere. Get out!

171
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,390
Son of a bitch!

172
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,480
Fix the handle Ray.
Fix the handle.

173
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,610
Get out!

174
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,410
Get off the track! Move!

175
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,420
- Let's get him out.
- Get him out of there.

176
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,800
- Somebody help him.
- You all right?

177
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,680
Please that guy's
still in there.

178
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,340
You sure?

179
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,180
Get him out of there!

180
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,270
Will you look at that?

181
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,960
- Ah shit. - I'm all right.
- I'm okay.

182
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,420
All of you people...

183
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,800
blocking the intersection...

184
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,600
you're all idiots.

185
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,890
You threw the dude's car at her.
And what's with the train?

186
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,440
Why didn't you just go straight
up in the air with the car?

187
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,360
You've obviously injured
that poor woman.

188
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,570
- She's right. She should sue you.
- Yeah she should sue you.

189
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,610
Well you should sue McDonald's
because they fucked you up.

190
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,160
You're an asshole.

191
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,660
And I can smell that
liquor on your breath.

192
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,000
- Because I've been drinking bitch.
- You're a drunk asshole!

193
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,000
- You think you're such a hero.
- Asshole!

194
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,300
- You're nothing but an asshole.
- We don't need you in this city.

195
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,300
Some superhero you are! Fly off!

196
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,760
Shut up!

197
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,510
Don't you understand? I'm alive.

198
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,350
I get to go home and see my family. I
should be dead right now right here.

199
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,480
Yeah he could've gone straight
up. Obviously you should've.

200
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,570
You know and I was upside
down for the train but...

201
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,950
No. Thank you.

202
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,200
Thank you very much Hancock.
Thank you.

203
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,620
Thank you Hancock.

204
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,370
You're not flying by
the Valley are you?

205
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,590
Throw the ball!

206
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,630
Monte one guy'll line up here
all right? Hike the ball.

207
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,970
This guy'll be right
here and he says "Hut!"

208
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,810
This guy'll drop back. Hut!
Drop back. Chuck it.

209
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,600
Great. Thank you.

210
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,310
Nice aim. The driveway
would've been better but...

211
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,320
- What's going on Dad?
- Hey buddy.

212
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,110
Daddy's had a little bit
of a day. Look at you huh?

213
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,610
I want you to meet somebody.

214
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,160
This guy here dragging Daddy's
car into the driveway.

215
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,780
- Who's this?
- Hancock.

216
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,200
That's right. Hancock
this is my boy Aaron.

217
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:07,040
- Ray what happened to the car?
- Oh boy.

218
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,920
You would not have believed it.

219
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:13,090
I came this close to getting hit by a
train. If it wasn't for that guy...

220
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,470
He saved my life. I mean...
Hancock this is my wife Mary.

221
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,720
Believe that? I almost kissed a train.
Saw my whole life flash before my eyes.

222
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,430
- He saved your life?
- He sure did. Thank you.

223
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,270
- Hey you good?
- I am good yeah.

224
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,770
- All right. Keep it off the tracks.
- I will definitely.

225
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,530
Hang on a... One second.

226
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,110
- Hancock you eat yes?
- Human food? - Yeah.

227
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,620
- You like meatballs?
- No.

228
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,830
Aaron sweetheart he
has to go and do...

229
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,040
- I love meatballs. - Who's so
busy they can't have a meal?

230
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,710
And it's on us. Please.

231
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,330
I'm not even gonna take no for
an answer. Get inside the house.

232
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,070
Why do you have an
eagle on your hat?

233
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,990
Do you like eagles?

234
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,370
This guy's like a little
talking machine huh?

235
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,490
We don't have a lot
of guests over here.

236
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,120
Look at that huh?
Hon is the heat on?

237
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,170
No? All right.

238
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,250
We started Spaghetti Madness
about two years ago.

239
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,130
We do it every Thursday and we
have not missed a Thursday in...

240
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,550
- Ever.
- Yeah.

241
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,970
- Ever? That's a long time.
- Yes sir.

242
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,140
- A very long time. - That's
some good meatballs boy.

243
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,640
Aaron.

244
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,730
- Your mama's calling you.
- Yes Mom?

245
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,230
No. His name is Aaron.

246
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,520
- Hey Aaron how was school today?
- Fine.

247
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,400
Yeah? No more problems
with that bully Michael?

248
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,910
- Michel. But not like a girl's name.
- Michel. No no I know.

249
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,620
- It's French. - Yeah.
- Michel Hancock is this...

250
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,160
Hancock? Michel is this
neighbourhood bully.

251
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,500
We've been trying to
teach Aaron a little...

252
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,380
about conflict resolution.
You know what I mean?

253
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,250
- Yeah. Turn the other cheek all that?
- That's exactly right.

254
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,800
Well just never turn
that one all right?

255
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,340
Never let them punk you.

256
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,140
- Got it Mr. Hancock.
- Aaron eat.

257
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,810
The way you deal with bullies
you take your right foot...

258
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,890
bring it right up and catch
him in his little piss pump.

259
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,440
You don't have to do that
honey okay? Seriously.

260
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,650
It's a good idea.

261
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,690
You aim straight and make sure
he can't use that thing...

262
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,990
for nothing but a flap to keep
the dust out of his butt crack.

263
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,610
Okay please just stop.

264
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,530
Michel is not a man okay?

265
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,490
He's a little boy.
And his parents...

266
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,200
happen to be going through a bad
divorce. That's why he's acting up.

267
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,710
Maybe you don't know this...

268
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,000
but not everything in this world
gets resolved with force.

269
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,210
- Not everything has to be bang...
- I'm set.

270
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:03,220
- ...scream blood more blood. - Baby
I got plenty. Angel! We're okay.

271
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,800
She watches so much news...

272
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,550
that sometimes it gets
to be a little too much.

273
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:11,180
- You got a toilet? - Yep.
- Yeah just past the fridge.

274
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,310
Are...?

275
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,360
Did he just take the whisky
bottle to the bathroom?

276
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,030
Do you want him to kill us all?

277
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,200
Thanks for coming on in.
Good right?

278
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,530
- Very yeah. - Wanna
say goodbye to him?

279
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,990
- Bye Hancock. - Hey all
right little buddy.

280
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,290
- Are you okay?
- It was a joke.

281
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,000
- Come on Aaron. - Hey sorry.
- I was just trying to...

282
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,590
He got it. She didn't get it.

283
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,170
I owe you. You gave me
my life back today.

284
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,380
Hear me out. I'd like
to return the favour.

285
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,260
Do you know what I do?
I'm in public relations.

286
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:51,060
You know what that is? Of course
you do. We're image consultants.

287
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,600
We change the way people see products
companies people that stuff.

288
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,770
Listen I see you on the news and
I see you out there today...

289
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,440
and it can't feel good that
people you know hate you.

290
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,690
- It's good to meet you Ray.
- No I'm sorry.

291
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,070
But hear me out.

292
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,910
People... Don't get me wrong they
should love you. They really should.

293
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,910
I wanna deliver that for you.
It's the least that I can do.

294
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,490
You know you're a superhero.

295
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,710
Kids should ask you
for your autograph.

296
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,710
People should cheer
you on the streets.

297
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,750
What the hell are you
pricks looking at?

298
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,750
No no they're not...
It's all right.

299
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,880
They're not pricks
they're just people.

300
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,550
But I want you to give me
one short pitch you know?

301
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,390
That's all I ask. Okay?

302
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,390
You use...

303
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,600
Put it under here?

304
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,140
Put it right there. Perfect.

305
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:40,190
E-mail me or whatever. You
just fly on over I don't know.

306
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,770
I want you to think about it.

307
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,480
Just be careful when you go.
Sleep on it all right?

308
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,780
You get back to me?

309
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,860
I'll be right here. All right.

310
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:53,490
Please don't stare you guys.
He's kind of one of us.

311
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,540
What about AllHeart?

312
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,000
It's a nonstarter babe you know?
I'm chasing windmills with that.

313
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:07,340
Maybe I can't change the world but
I can change this guy's life.

314
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:11,180
- Think about all the good he can do.
- I think you're wasting your time.

315
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,100
You really hate him.

316
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,430
Hate? I don't hate him Ray.
I don't even know the guy.

317
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,600
Just look at the news. You
can see what he does.

318
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:24,360
I think he just needs
people to care you know?

319
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,070
You see the good
in everybody Ray.

320
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,240
Even sometimes when
it's not there.

321
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,490
I have a feeling about this.
Don't work with this guy.

322
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:42,080
I know this kind of guy.
He breaks things.

323
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,160
My bad. Everybody all right?

324
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,960
I'll go and get my mommy.

325
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,500
He is an asshole.

326
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,010
- What's your name boy?
- Michel.

327
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,640
- You know who I am? - My
papa says you are an asshole.

328
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,600
Well that's not really a nice
word to call a person is it?

329
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,650
- Asshole?
- Yeah.

330
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,860
Because that could make
someone very angry...

331
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,240
and you know maybe
hurt their feelings.

332
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,950
You behave like an asshole.

333
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,240
All right...

334
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,950
Do you know Aaron?

335
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,590
Well seems to be a
pretty good kid.

336
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,130
Just wanna ask you to lay
off of him a little bit.

337
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,010
Why asshole?

338
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,850
- You're gonna stop calling me that.
- Asshole.

339
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,060
- That's not my name.
- Asshole.

340
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,530
Call me a asshole...

341
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,070
one more time.

342
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,820
Asshole.

343
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,950
How about you thickness?

344
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,620
Goggles?

345
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,710
Hancock! You son of a
gun I knew you'd come.

346
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,290
Ask Mary. I had a feeling.

347
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,710
I said he heard me and
he's ready for a change.

348
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,630
This is great. Did you do this?
You come in a little hot?

349
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,300
I'll meet you in the house.

350
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,510
- I know you don't drive but...
- Oh damn it Ray.

351
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:30,190
All right. You're all right. You're
all right. You're all right.

352
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,360
Oh stop crying punk-ass.
Go ahead.

353
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,320
- Not okay. Okay?
- He all right.

354
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,740
Really not okay. This is some of
the stuff we're gonna work on.

355
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,990
How do you think that conversation's
gonna go down with his mom?

356
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,910
Landing like that in the street's
also on the uncool side.

357
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,370
No that was already like
that when I got here Ray.

358
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,710
I live here. I know
what the street's like.

359
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,750
We'll make those
problems of the past.

360
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,470
I'm gonna teach you how to
interface with the public.

361
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,800
- Where's the wife? - Mary
took Aaron to his soccer game.

362
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,930
Hancock pulled some
stuff up on Youtube.

363
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,390
Surprisingly large amount of not-great
stuff on you that's gonna be helpful.

364
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,850
What is this?

365
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,770
That's me trying to
change the world.

366
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,860
Unfortunately not
doing real well.

367
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,980
Come on. Let's get to you.

368
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,610
This stuff was on Youtube.

369
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,110
Everybody loves a Nutty Buddy I
get it but this doesn't work sir.

370
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:24,950
Hey give me a Nutty Buddy.
Back up back up.

371
00:28:24,951 --> 00:28:28,080
Hey give me a Nutty Buddy.
Back up back up.

372
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,620
Mom! Mom! Mom!

373
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,580
Those are children.

374
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,670
- We've been waiting a long time...
- Get that camera out of my face..

375
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,220
You ever put out an
apartment fire Ray?

376
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,970
- No I haven't done that. I'm in P.R.
- No. My ass was hot.

377
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,390
All right. How about this?
This is Walter the grey whale.

378
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,350
Everybody remembers him stuck
on the beach north of Zuma.

379
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,560
Along comes Hancock.

380
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,940
Hancock!

381
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:12,040
- I don't even remember that.
- Yeah.

382
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,330
Greenpeace does. Walter does.

383
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,840
This gets redundant
after a while...

384
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,130
but my basic diagnosis of your
fundamental problem is...

385
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,970
- Do you wanna hear it?
- No.

386
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,470
You're an asshole.

387
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,930
I know. I call it
like I see it though.

388
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:30,100
It's not a crime to be an asshole
but it's counterproductive.

389
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,270
But you are an asshole
don't you think?

390
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,100
Be careful.

391
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,520
All right how about this? I've
been thinking about something.

392
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,320
This kind of goes to how
you present yourself.

393
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,780
Come on. Really? It's the middle of
the day. What Springs to mind...

394
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,410
when you see this?

395
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,320
Homo.

396
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,160
- What about that?
- Homo in red.

397
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,630
- Norwegian homo.
- I'll give you that.

398
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:02,130
Let's move past the comics. Let's
get into something a little deeper.

399
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:07,510
I think that deep down you behave
badly because you're lonely.

400
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,600
I think deep down you
want people's acceptance.

401
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,310
Come on now. You save
people's lives...

402
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,560
and they reject you and
so you reject them back.

403
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:20,560
And it's a... And we're
gonna switch that cycle.

404
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,520
We're gonna start
fresh start anew.

405
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:26,610
This is outstanding. If you turn
some of this power into willpower...

406
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,030
- Almost. - And then
he kicked it in.

407
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,160
Hey Hancock! We almost won.

408
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,620
Yeah we did. Okay upstairs.
I'm making lunch. Go change.

409
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,200
Hey sweetheart.

410
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,170
Have you been watching the news?

411
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:42,130
- No we've been working on...
- Interfacing with the public.

412
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,460
- This has been on all day.
- That's very good.

413
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:48,050
The law is the law Mr. Hancock
and you are not above it.

414
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,510
Felony destruction
of property...

415
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,470
amounting to tens of millions
of dollars theft and now this.

416
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:00,100
From where I sit I see a
selfish self-absorbed man...

417
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:04,610
with a lot of muscle but no
regard for anyone but yourself.

418
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,110
Mr. Hancock let me remind you.

419
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,070
You are not above the law.

420
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,160
You have failed to show at over
600 subpoenas in civil suits.

421
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:19,000
Anybody else would be held in
contempt. But oh no. Not you.

422
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,290
You may be a superhero but
let me tell you this.

423
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:26,340
You're not nearly as strong
as the U.S. Constitution.

424
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,010
Bank on it buddy.

425
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,880
We do not condone the t...

426
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,100
Genius.

427
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,850
Things just got real. This
is exactly what we need.

428
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,020
There's a DA trying to figure
out how to put you in jail.

429
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,810
- Bitch can try.
- I say you go.

430
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,940
People take you for granted.
Make people miss you.

431
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:51,280
- People don't like you Hancock.
- I do.

432
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:54,490
Two weeks you know? The public
will be clamouring for you.

433
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,370
When they do we'll be ready.

434
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,210
Worst-case scenario is I'm wrong and
you just you know fly out of there.

435
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,620
What do you got to lose?

436
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,100
"I apologise to the
people of Los Angeles."

437
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,820
My behaviour has been improper
and I accept the consequences.

438
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,650
I ask my fellow Angelenos...

439
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,780
for their patience
and understanding...

440
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,490
You're an asshole Hancock!

441
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,700
Asshole!

442
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,000
"Life here can be
difficult for me."

443
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,290
After all I'm the
only one of my kind.

444
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,500
During my incarceration I
will be participating...

445
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,920
in alcohol-and
anger-management treatment...

446
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,060
You're a drunk bum!

447
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,350
"You deserve better from me. I can
be better. I will be better."

448
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,390
All right.

449
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:12,070
Good morning ladies. Welcome
to your new home...

450
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,660
It is the duty of each of you...

451
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,200
to remember your
inmate serial number..

452
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,540
Turn to your right.

453
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,920
Turn to your left.

454
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,920
Okay scumbags. Let's go.

455
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,180
Give me the hand playboy.

456
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,360
I see you punk!

457
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,800
Oh I get it.

458
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:22,390
I put some... Most
of you in here.

459
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,560
Yes you did.

460
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:31,400
I can understand you feeling
some kind of way about that.

461
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,070
What?

462
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:38,410
So I'm gonna do me and I'm
gonna let you do you.

463
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,740
I don't want no trouble.

464
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,240
All right?

465
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:45,410
I just wanna go to my cell.

466
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,420
- That ain't gonna happen.
- Nope.

467
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,880
Excuse me.

468
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,670
Excuse me please.

469
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,090
Deadly.

470
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:05,520
If you don't move your
head is going up his ass.

471
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,570
Y'all fellas sure you
wanna ride this train?

472
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,490
Choo choo asshole.

473
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,050
Get him out! Get him out!

474
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:46,600
Did you shove a man's head
up another man's ass?

475
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,860
We're gonna... We're gonna
circle back to that.

476
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,400
The DA's office wants your
sentence to run eight years.

477
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,700
It's a big number but not
something we didn't anticipate.

478
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,950
You know our plan is...
What are you doing?

479
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,200
Hey hey hey!

480
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,750
It sounded like you said they want me
to spend eight years in this shithole.

481
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,590
Eight is more like four and
a half with good behaviour.

482
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,890
But it's irrelevant because
with you out of the picture...

483
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,680
and with the crime rate going
up through the roof...

484
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:31,810
the DA and the cops they're all gonna
call for your immediate release.

485
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,600
They're gonna demand it. Where
are you going? Sit down.

486
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:37,400
Hey. Hey. Stop right there.

487
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,780
- Stop it. Hancock.
- Move.

488
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,490
- Hancock!
- Get back!

489
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,200
You're being a coward!

490
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,950
- Who you talking to?
- I'm talking to you.

491
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,990
- Who are you talking to Ray? - Stop
pretending that you do not care.

492
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,620
You have a calling.
You're a hero Hancock.

493
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:55,630
You're gonna be miserable the rest
of your life until you accept that.

494
00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:00,130
Trust me. Trust this plan this
process. Just stay in here.

495
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:04,090
When they call a hero's
what we're gonna give them.

496
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,970
How we gonna do that Ray?

497
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,140
All right guys let's
start sharing.

498
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:14,230
- Don? You had something?
- Yeah.

499
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,520
Yeah I think I might've had a
little bit of a breakthrough.

500
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,360
Good for you.

501
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:26,320
Yeah I mean I realised that
breaking necks is... it's easy.

502
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:31,910
But I'm sitting there and I'm
staring at myself in the mirror...

503
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,920
and I thought "This is
tough." - Yeah it sounds tough.

504
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,290
Why do you always laugh?

505
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,880
Picturing you looking at the mirror.
It would scare the shit out of me.

506
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:45,880
Every time I'm talking he
completely ruins the cycle.

507
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,550
Now let's watch the crosstalk.

508
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,180
I'm not gonna share anymore
if he keeps doing that.

509
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,600
No no no.

510
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,850
- Keep sharing.
- Let's move on.

511
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,890
Mr. Hancock do you
wanna share today?

512
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,060
Pass.

513
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,860
Your landing is your first impression.
It's your superhero handshake.

514
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:06,360
Don't come in too hot okay?
Don't come in too boozy.

515
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,950
And don't land on a $100000
Mercedes. All right?

516
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,870
People have to be happy
that you've arrived.

517
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,000
Mr. Hancock your share.

518
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,160
Pass.

519
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:19,080
So you've used the door and
the building's still intact.

520
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,750
People are happy that you've
arrived. They feel safe.

521
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,170
There's an officer and
he's done a good job...

522
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,090
so tell him he's
done a good job.

523
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,180
What the hell did I have to come
for if he's done a good job?

524
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,230
Oh man!

525
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,400
KBLA radio AM 850.

526
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:49,070
Today's big story no surprise
here: Hancock. What's your take?

527
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,120
I for one have had
enough of this guy.

528
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,990
I'm glad he's doing time around bars and
I hope they don't let him off easy.

529
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,540
Let my cousin Pookie out..

530
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,500
"I see you don't wear a bulletproof
vest security officer."

531
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,880
I respect your courage...

532
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,500
"...because bullets don't bounce
off you they bounce off me."

533
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,180
This city is being run by
gangs and drug dealers.

534
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,600
Hancock makes them
shake in their boots.

535
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,980
He doesn't tie a pretty ribbon
around it but he gets the job done.

536
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,350
Besides he's hot..

537
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,770
Let me hear you say it. Let
me hear you say "Good job."

538
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,070
G...

539
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,740
Goo...

540
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,610
Mr. Hancock would
you like to share?

541
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:36,080
- Pass.
- Good.

542
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,910
Good.

543
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,670
Good j...

544
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,170
Good j...

545
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:47,340
Good job.

546
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,090
Good job.

547
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,470
Jail watch day five and true to his
word Hancock remains incarcerated.

548
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,680
Meanwhile crime is
still on the rise.

549
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:59,350
The L.A.P.D. is reporting
increases of up to 30 percent...

550
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,940
in the last five days that
Hancock has been behind bars..

551
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,200
- Hancock! Hey Hancock!
- Hey little buddy.

552
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,240
- Hancock. We brought you something!
- Hey hey.

553
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,330
Hey what's up Hancock?

554
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,120
Where's...? Where's Ray?

555
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,790
No it's just us. Ray's working.

556
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,960
Aaron really wanted to
come and see you...

557
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,340
so we just dropped by with
some Spaghetti Madness.

558
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,920
I should probably let the
guard check for keys...

559
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:34,050
- No no. Here. - Okay.
- Here you go.

560
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,430
Oh you brought me meatballs huh?

561
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,310
- Just dig in. - Oh man
look at that. Look at that.

562
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,900
- That's a good meatball.
- Thanks Hancock.

563
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,370
Ray is a good man.

564
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,920
Whatever this is you're
doing don't let him down.

565
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,920
Okay?

566
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,640
Okay. Well we should
probably go buddy.

567
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,760
- Already? I wanna stay with Hancock.
- Yeah. Sweetheart...

568
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:21,770
we have to go. Come on
say goodbye to Hancock.

569
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:25,140
Here Hancock. It's my favourite
one and I want you to have it.

570
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,520
- That was very sweet.
- Thanks Mom.

571
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,270
Come here.

572
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:49,960
Mr. Hancock would
you like to share?

573
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,750
Pass.

574
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,170
All right. Phillip?

575
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,090
I love you guys man.

576
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,010
- We love you. - We
love you too Phillip.

577
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,360
For when they call.

578
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:59,660
- I ain't wearing that Ray.
- Yes you are.

579
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,530
- Oh no I'm not.
- No you are.

580
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,910
Actually I'm not Ray.

581
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,870
You think you're
not but you are.

582
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,920
I will fight crime butt-ass naked
before I fight it in that Ray.

583
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:13,840
You know you have fought naked.
We've got that. That's on Youtube.

584
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,630
Hancock this is a uniform. A
uniform represents purpose.

585
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,470
Doctors policemen firemen right?

586
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,180
- It represents a calling.
- It's been two weeks.

587
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,770
- Yeah? - Nobody out
there is missing me Ray.

588
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,310
Just be patient. You gotta
trust me on this. All right?

589
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:59,760
Perimeter breach
perimeter breach.

590
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:02,680
Asshole!

591
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,980
You're still a fake-ass punk.

592
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,320
Damn!

593
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:26,580
Mr. Hancock?

594
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,660
It's your share.

595
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:33,170
Pass.

596
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:38,840
- Come on man try it. Let it out.
- Come on John.

597
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,300
I don't have nothing.

598
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:43,010
There's nothing on your mind?
Come on John.

599
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,470
- It's cool man.
- Come on.

600
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,890
- Come on.
- Do it.

601
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,390
First time for everything.

602
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,770
- Feels good to release now. - Let
it heal. Come on man try it.

603
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:54,400
Come in here all these days you
don't have anything to share?

604
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:00,940
I'm Hancock and I
drink and stuff.

605
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:05,450
All right. Thanks for sharing.

606
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:08,450
- Okay.
- Thank you.

607
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,240
- All right.
- That's awesome.

608
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:13,460
- That's a clap. Yeah.
- There you go. Good share.

609
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:31,270
Hey Hancock.

610
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:33,350
Come on get up.

611
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,560
- You got a phone call.
- Take a message.

612
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,940
It's the chief of police.

613
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:41,530
He says he needs your help.

614
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,350
The trapped officer's husband
is Corporal Joseph Blake...

615
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:12,350
who was killed last
year in Iraq...

616
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,980
leaving her two small children. We
are waiting for the latest news...

617
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,730
but apparently there are
three suspects and...

618
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,150
What's going on?

619
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,150
I'm out!

620
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,450
Stay down! Stay down!

621
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,320
Stay down!

622
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:30,070
- Get out!
- Get down!

623
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,410
Get it down!

624
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:39,540
Let's go! Everybody's
gotta get back! Let's go!

625
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:42,000
Back! Move!

626
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:58,390
We got perimeters set up on the
north east and South sides.

627
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,400
The West Side is open.

628
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,620
Don't break the building
don't break the building.

629
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:21,460
What?

630
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,590
It's a little tight.
What you got?

631
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,760
Bank job. I got at least eight
hostages. Four bad guys.

632
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:34,100
Officer pinned down.
We can't get to her.

633
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:38,230
They been spraying the hell
out of us all morning. And...

634
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:41,810
They got some kind of heavy
artillery. Fifty calibre or bigger.

635
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,650
- I don't know if that matters to you.
- No I'm good.

636
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,490
Good job.

637
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:56,910
Good job.

638
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,210
Really good job.

639
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,170
Get down!

640
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:39,660
It's Hancock!

641
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,300
Take him out!

642
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,880
Good job!

643
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,010
Do I have permission
to touch your body?

644
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:58,720
Yes!

645
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,270
It's not sexual.

646
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,980
Not that you're not
an attractive woman.

647
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,980
- You're a very attractive woman...
- Get me the fuck out of here!

648
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,120
He's on the move!

649
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,420
He's moving he's moving!

650
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,270
Good job.

651
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:44,890
- Are you hit anywhere?
- My leg!

652
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,600
- Hancock!
- Good job.

653
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:49,150
You said that. I need
you to end this now.

654
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,370
Check the flanks.

655
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:02,830
Secure the perimeter.

656
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:08,290
Spread out!

657
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,500
They're gonna come
around the back.

658
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,680
What happened to him?

659
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,560
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

660
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,240
What is happening?

661
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,760
- I heard you was in the slammer.
- Out early.

662
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,590
- Why's that?
- Good behaviour.

663
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,100
Do you know what this is?

664
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:08,690
I'm guessing it's some kind
of detonator-type deal.

665
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:12,230
There's 8 pounds of C-4 strapped
to each and every one of them.

666
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,480
This is a spring-loaded
dead man's switch.

667
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:16,280
If my thumb comes off it.

668
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:22,780
And now since we've had a
little change of plan...

669
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:27,120
between the police showing up and you
sucking out all of my associates...

670
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:29,460
I want you to break
into the vault.

671
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:32,880
You'll find three quarter-ton
pallets of small bills inside.

672
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:34,630
Thirty million dollars.

673
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:37,550
And you're gonna
carry it for me.

674
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,720
You are gonna get me safely away
from here with the money...

675
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:46,220
or else they'll be cleaning
up these hostages with a mop.

676
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:51,230
I'm gonna have to
say no to that.

677
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,320
I'm really trying to
turn over a new leaf.

678
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,190
I will blow up this entire
building you asshole.

679
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,660
I really don't like that word.

680
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,790
I will blow them sky-high...

681
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:09,660
and their blood will
be on your hands.

682
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:15,340
Do you hear me asshole?

683
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:26,510
Call me a asshole...

684
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:28,390
one more time.

685
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,230
Ass...

686
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:40,440
- Go go go. Move in!
- Go on you're safe!

687
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:43,030
- Let's go. Let's go. - Take
it right in. Let's go.

688
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,240
Bring it around now.

689
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,390
Keep your hand on that trigger.

690
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,600
- Good job. - No.
- You good job.

691
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,940
- Thank you.
- Good job.

692
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:21,030
Hancock!

693
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:18,330
Say hi to your fans.
Look what you got.

694
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,630
Here we go. This way.

695
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:24,380
- Hancock. At the bank today intense.
- Thank you.

696
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:26,340
Smile.

697
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:27,630
Good job Hancock!

698
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,220
Hey. Boy they'll let
anybody in here huh?

699
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:36,350
Hancock meet these guys. This is
Mike Kilbourne and Jeremy Himmel.

700
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,020
Gigantic fans. Insane!

701
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:40,440
These guys are partners
at the biggest ad firm.

702
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:41,940
You never call man.

703
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:46,150
- I have called. A couple of times.
- Water under the bridge man.

704
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:52,160
Could you guys get
used to this or what?

705
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,790
How'd you two meet?

706
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,250
I was married once before.

707
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:01,500
First wife...

708
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:05,460
she died giving birth to Aaron.

709
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:10,340
It's another dinner.
But... But...

710
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:13,100
So there I am I'm with this
beautiful little baby.

711
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,060
I don't know what
the hell to do.

712
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,480
And I was in the supermarket...

713
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,100
and I'm in the baby aisle...

714
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:22,860
and I've got a brand of
diapers in each hand.

715
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:26,990
I'm staring at them but I don't know
how I'm gonna get through the day.

716
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,450
An angel...

717
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,990
sees me.

718
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:37,620
She knew. She was...
She gave me this look.

719
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:44,210
And even in the trance I was in I
knew that somebody somewhere...

720
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,420
was throwing me a little rope.

721
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:48,260
You know?

722
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:52,430
Starting that day you really put
my life back together. Right?

723
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,560
- You're drunk.
- So? Come here.

724
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:04,400
What about you buddy?

725
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,530
You're from another
planet aren't you?

726
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,860
No man I'm from Miami.

727
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:11,410
You didn't come in on
like a meteor or...?

728
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:14,160
Nope. Woke up in a hospital
first thing I remember.

729
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:18,330
Government hospital yes?
Experimenting on you and...

730
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:22,290
No Ray. Regular old
Miami emergency room.

731
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,880
- Come on. - My skull
was fractured.

732
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,670
They told me I tried
to stop a mugging.

733
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:34,090
- Somebody knocked you out. - I
guess I was a regular guy before...

734
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:37,510
and when I woke
up I was changed.

735
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,270
The hospital nurse tried to
put a needle in my arm...

736
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,730
and it just broke
against my skin.

737
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,610
And then my skull
healed in like an hour.

738
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:51,360
The doctors were astounded...

739
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:55,320
and they wanted
to know my story.

740
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:59,240
Just like you. But I couldn't
tell them. I don't know who I am.

741
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,080
Amnesia.

742
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:06,170
- You know the blow to the head.
- Yeah well that's what they figured.

743
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:10,050
- You don't remember anything?
- No.

744
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:14,010
Only thing I had in
my pocket was...

745
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,140
bubble-gum...

746
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,430
two movie tickets.

747
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,230
Boris Karloff Frankenstein..

748
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:25,650
But no lD nothing.

749
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:30,530
I went to sign out the nurse
asked me for my John Hancock.

750
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,150
I actually thought
that's who I was.

751
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,030
How come I didn't
hear any of this...

752
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,160
didn't read about it
in any newspapers?

753
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:42,700
It was probably in the
papers 80 years ago.

754
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:44,750
Eighty years ago?

755
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,210
Oh I don't age. This is it.

756
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:50,210
- That's nice. - Gotta
wonder though.

757
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:55,880
What kind of bastard
must I have been...

758
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,720
that nobody was
there to claim me?

759
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:10,400
I mean I'm not the most
charming guy in the world...

760
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,990
so I've been told but...

761
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,070
nobody?

762
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:34,210
Whoever it was they'd
be dead by now anyway.

763
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,550
Hey.

764
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,510
Hey Mary. You all right baby?

765
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,430
Yeah. Too much wine.

766
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,060
I am a lightweight.

767
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:55,110
I'm sorry.

768
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:00,620
You ain't do nothing.

769
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:06,910
This was a nice dinner Ray.

770
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:13,800
- It was a good one.
- Almost call this fun.

771
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:20,840
That didn't tire you out
coming up the stairs?

772
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:23,140
- Not really. - I'm
real spinny.

773
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:26,220
Could've just flown me upstairs.

774
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:29,060
- I could've done without that.
- Get your shoes off here.

775
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:32,610
All right that's all you're
getting off of me though.

776
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:38,570
You believe in me
don't you Hancock?

777
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,870
- Of course Ray. I believe in you.
- Help me up here.

778
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:44,080
I got something to say to you.

779
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,700
Listen to me. This is important.

780
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,000
You are like a Dodger Dog.

781
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:55,880
It's something people don't
think they're gonna like...

782
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,550
then they try it and they love
it right? It hits the spot.

783
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,590
It's good for the soul. You're
like the world's Dodger Dog.

784
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,930
I don't know. But you
know what I mean right?

785
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:08,430
You're gonna do great.

786
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,770
You're gonna fix everything.

787
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:20,780
- You get some sleep Ray.
- You sleep tight too.

788
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:24,030
Hancock tucking me in.

789
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,170
All right he's asleep.

790
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:45,430
- Okay thanks. Good night.
- Good night.

791
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:56,440
Look I just don't want you
to think that... That Ray...

792
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:58,480
you know drinks like
that because...

793
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:00,900
- Oh no. - This was
just kind of...

794
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:03,030
- ...a celebratory night.
- No I understand.

795
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,200
- Yeah I know that.
- Okay.

796
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:12,580
The damn babysitter never
cleans up after herself.

797
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,520
You have a bruise on your hand.

798
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,770
Yeah I don't... I don't
know what that is.

799
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,980
I've been feeling kind of funny.

800
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:46,820
You...

801
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:49,120
You should go.

802
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:56,710
Getting late.

803
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:49,470
If Ray finds out about me...

804
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,680
you're dead.

805
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:44,400
Joan we're gonna take care of
that okay? Don't you worry.

806
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,240
Hi honey.

807
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,410
Breakfast?

808
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:53,410
Hancock sneezed huh?

809
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:56,750
Can you believe it? It's amazing
that you slept through that.

810
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:59,750
- You're a good sleeper.
- Holy shit.

811
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:03,380
I'm not gonna say I
told you so but...

812
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,630
You told me he was gonna sneeze
a hole through the house?

813
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,260
I just said him being around...

814
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:10,630
Oh sweetheart can you get that?
Thanks.

815
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:13,260
- Oh God you strong man.
- I got it.

816
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:15,720
But you don't worry
about anything.

817
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:19,230
I already apologised to the
neighbours. Called State Farm.

818
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:20,850
Everything is taken care of.

819
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,270
You just...

820
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,360
enjoy that breakfast.

821
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:31,950
What's this? Are we going
on vacation? Are we?

822
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:33,320
Just the three of us.

823
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:34,950
- End of the summer?
- Tonight.

824
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,290
- Tonight? - Spur
of the moment.

825
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:40,960
- Tonight might be a little tough.
- Come on. The three of us?

826
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:43,000
Me in a bikini?

827
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,710
- Sounds good. - Let's
go somewhere.

828
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:45,880
Knock knock.

829
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:50,090
Gesundheit.

830
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:55,300
I was just telling Ray here I
hope you're done sneezing...

831
01:04:55,470 --> 01:05:00,770
because I don't think our house could
take much more of your sneezing.

832
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:11,030
Yeah sometimes I sneeze
when there's dust...

833
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:15,660
or if I get really surprised.

834
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:19,990
That's unfortunate.
This is Kilbourne.

835
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:23,250
Mike? How you doing?

836
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,380
It was great to see you too.

837
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:29,750
Yep. Well...

838
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,340
Right. Go ahead shoot.

839
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:36,550
Okay. I got a pen right here.

840
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:39,560
Right. No I know.

841
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,770
It's right here in my hand.

842
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,360
I am warning you.

843
01:05:56,530 --> 01:05:57,780
All right go ahead.

844
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:02,450
Okay good.

845
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:08,000
Now... And that's
still in 310 right?

846
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:09,340
Hang on one second.

847
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:11,460
Do me a favour...?

848
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:15,630
I'm sorry Mike. Yeah.

849
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,680
We're gonna talk.

850
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,760
Go away.

851
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:24,850
Well it is something that
I'm really excited about.

852
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:39,320
- I'm gonna do this all day.
- Shut... Shut up.

853
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,200
I... I suppose...

854
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:45,710
- Fine. We'll talk okay?
- We will.

855
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:50,750
And when we're done talking you go
away and you leave my family alone.

856
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:54,960
- My place at 4:00.
- Whatever.

857
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,340
It means... Well I'd rather
not talk numbers now.

858
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:02,600
I'd like to save them for the
pitch. So let's just set a time.

859
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,810
That's good with me. I will
see you then. All right.

860
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,900
Yeah 3:30. Great.

861
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:11,650
Hon is it hot in here?

862
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:36,090
He hurt you didn't he?

863
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:39,590
Come on use your words.

864
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,300
How did it make you feel?

865
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:46,350
Sore.

866
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:48,140
Bad.

867
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,270
Bad.

868
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:54,650
It's because he took your power. And
you have to get your power back.

869
01:07:56,150 --> 01:08:00,570
And no one will give you your power
back. You have to go out and take it.

870
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:02,870
You understand me?

871
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:06,490
We're gonna go find Hancock...

872
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,460
and get your power back.

873
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:43,160
Well I'm here.

874
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,700
Yup.

875
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:54,710
- You wanna do it?
- Do what?

876
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:00,550
I don't have time for this okay?
You ask the questions...

877
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,680
I answer them honestly
and then you leave L.A.

878
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,430
I ain't leaving L.A.

879
01:09:06,970 --> 01:09:10,020
All right all right. Jeez.

880
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:13,650
Don't.

881
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,580
Ask.

882
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,250
- You and I. - "You
and I" what?

883
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:34,170
- We're the same.
- No.

884
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,500
I'm stronger.

885
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:38,710
Really?

886
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:43,260
Oh yeah.

887
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,090
Who are we?

888
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:51,060
Gods angels. Different cultures
call us by different names.

889
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:54,270
Now all of a sudden
it's "superhero."

890
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:58,060
- Are there more of us?
- There were.

891
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,570
They all died.

892
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:03,740
It's just the two of us.

893
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:13,870
What is this?

894
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,460
Who are we to each other?

895
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:22,630
- We're brother and sister.
- That's a lie.

896
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:25,880
- No I'm your sister.
- That is a lie.

897
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:27,760
- I'm your sister.
- That is a lie.

898
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:31,060
Sisters don't kiss brothers the
way you kissed me last night.

899
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:32,560
You're lying deal's off.

900
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,810
Let's go see how Ray
feels about this.

901
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,150
Get your ass back here!

902
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:39,230
I'm telling!

903
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:46,990
The AllHeart symbol will
be known globally...

904
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,160
as a symbol...

905
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:54,200
that represents companies that are
committed to changing the world.

906
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:56,830
They can give away their
sustenance goods okay?

907
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,290
Food drugs power
clothing for free..

908
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:01,880
- We were talking about Hancock...
- Number two.

909
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:14,970
You stay away from
me and my family.

910
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:17,560
You are not gonna do
this to me again.

911
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:20,770
What? I don't know what
you're talking about.

912
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:22,900
- Hey!
- I love you Hancock!

913
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:26,570
It can't work. It always
ends the same way.

914
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:29,240
Persia. Greece. Brooklyn.

915
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,200
Brooklyn? I've never
been to Brooklyn.

916
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:34,080
I have put up with your
bullshit for 3000 years...

917
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:36,160
and I am done! Done
you listening?

918
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:39,620
- I don't know what you're talking about!
- Finally I am happy!

919
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:43,420
- You are not gonna mess with that! - I
don't know what you're talking about!

920
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:46,090
I hate to burst your little
crazy-lady bubble...

921
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:50,930
but it must not have been all that
great because I don't remember you.

922
01:11:55,930 --> 01:11:58,310
Call me crazy...

923
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:01,690
one more time.

924
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:03,270
Cuckoo.

925
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:14,080
All right hold it. All right.

926
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:17,410
You better not hit
me with that truck.

927
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:21,920
For companies to qualify they need to
prove they are a leader in the global...

928
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,710
We wanna talk about Mr. Hancock.

929
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,840
They're committed to
bettering the world.

930
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,460
They can do this in four ways.
This is how they...

931
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:14,010
The most important thing with
AllHeart is brand recognition.

932
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:16,140
I've mocked up these
examples here...

933
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:18,310
in Tokyo London Dubai Paris.

934
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:31,780
Oh no.

935
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,320
We need maximum exposure
market penetra...

936
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:35,530
Is it snowing?

937
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:52,010
Stop. Stop it.

938
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:54,970
Stop. Stop. Stop! All
right let's just...

939
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:56,300
Get off me!

940
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:04,640
Get off me!

941
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,020
Stop. Stop!

942
01:14:07,190 --> 01:14:08,810
Get off!

943
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:10,230
- Get off me!
- Listen to me!

944
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,860
- I hate you!
- I am sorry!

945
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:20,870
Whoever I am whatever I did...
Look at me.

946
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,790
I'm sorry.

947
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:26,250
I don't remember.

948
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:29,590
You are the most beautiful
thing I have ever seen.

949
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:41,930
Oh my God.

950
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,690
Why were you flying?
You were flying Mary.

951
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:39,610
- Yeah she was definitely flying Ray.
- Okay I was flying.

952
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:43,370
And I'm very strong as well.

953
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:45,080
- It's just the way we are.
- "We"?

954
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,330
Me and him it's just us now.
The others paired up and died.

955
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:51,420
You didn't say anything about
pairing up at the trailer.

956
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:54,210
- You were at his trailer.
- This is hard to explain.

957
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:55,800
- Great I'm all ears.
- Me too.

958
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:58,760
Do me a favour just give
me and my wife one moment.

959
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:01,390
- Don't bring it here Ray.
- The adults are talking.

960
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:03,220
Technically speaking...

961
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:06,270
he's my husband.

962
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:09,890
Holy shit.

963
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:13,110
- What? - We broke
up decades ago.

964
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:16,230
Long before you were born.
He just can't remember.

965
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,530
But you can right? You knew?

966
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,200
That's something you bring
up on a first date Mary.

967
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:25,660
"I don't like to travel. I'm
allergic to cats. I'm immortal."

968
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:28,250
Those are some things
you give a heads-up on.

969
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:32,330
Whatever we are we were built in twos
okay? We're drawn to each other.

970
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,880
No matter how far I run
he's always there.

971
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,670
He finds me. It's physics.

972
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:39,550
Are you saying that you two
are fated to be together?

973
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,640
I've lived for a
very long time Ray.

974
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:44,760
And the one thing I learned...

975
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:47,720
fate doesn't decide everything.

976
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,680
People get to choose.

977
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:52,140
And you chose...

978
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:55,650
to let me think I
was here alone.

979
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,740
I didn't think you'd miss
what you didn't remember.

980
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:11,660
Great. Now what?

981
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,300
I didn't plan for this.

982
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:43,650
Prison authorities confirmed...

983
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:47,530
that the prisoner uprising was led
by Kenneth "Red" Parker Jr...

984
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:51,040
who was also the leader of last
week's Spring Street bank robbery.

985
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,540
At least eight prisoners
are not accounted for.

986
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:56,000
More information on the
prison riot in Norwalk.

987
01:17:56,170 --> 01:17:59,420
Construction workers at the
prison were knocked unconscious.

988
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:01,630
The prisoners stole the
workers clothes...

989
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,510
and it's feared at least
some of them have escaped.

990
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,930
Parker is considered a
criminal mastermind.

991
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:09,810
He is very effective at using
psychological persuasion...

992
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:12,470
to organise criminals from
different backgrounds.

993
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,600
He is a former psychology Professor
from Stanford University.

994
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:18,480
While there he organised a
notorious criminal network...

995
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:21,030
comprised of graduate
students from diverse...

996
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:23,280
Ninety-one ten.

997
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,780
Ninety-one ten? You
gotta be shitting me.

998
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,660
Ninety-one ten.

999
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:30,240
Highway robbery.

1000
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,520
- What? - I'm
taking the money.

1001
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:04,570
I can relate to that.

1002
01:19:06,990 --> 01:19:09,820
You know? If you
want something...

1003
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:13,790
nobody can stop you
from taking it...

1004
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:17,120
you just take it right?

1005
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:20,670
I like that.

1006
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,050
But can you take it?

1007
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:29,090
My Zagnut bar versus your gun.

1008
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,600
Sorry about your window.

1009
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:26,780
- I need Room 1020.
- Clear!

1010
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:28,440
I need Room 1020.

1011
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:35,870
I need IV line blood quality
CBC electrolytes a PT and...

1012
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,580
Where's his IV line?

1013
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:40,080
- That's not gonna work.
- I'm in.

1014
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:43,000
What's happening?

1015
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:48,880
This just in. John Hancock
has been rushed...

1016
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:50,800
to Los Angeles
General Hospital.

1017
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:54,180
Hancock is in serious condition
with multiple gunshot wounds.

1018
01:20:54,340 --> 01:20:56,510
No story yet as to how
this happened to him...

1019
01:20:56,680 --> 01:21:00,680
but we will continue to cover this
story live. Reporting live from L.A...

1020
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:09,900
- Any lead on the assailant?
- Mr. Embrey!

1021
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:14,070
- Just a couple of questions sir please.
- Can you describe how it happened?

1022
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:17,620
From what I've heard he was
trying to stop a robbery.

1023
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:21,410
Do you know if special ammunition
was used in the gun that shot him?

1024
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:22,750
Not that I'm aware of.

1025
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:25,330
Could this have to do with
the mysterious woman?

1026
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:28,250
- He was seen battling her.
- I do not have that answer.

1027
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:31,590
Could this woman be more
powerful than Hancock?

1028
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:37,350
Here are the lab
results for 209.

1029
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:06,920
You're becoming mortal.

1030
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:10,420
It's us...

1031
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,090
being close to each other.

1032
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:17,010
It's never happened
this fast before.

1033
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:20,970
You have to leave.

1034
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:25,100
The further you get from me
the better you're gonna feel.

1035
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:27,900
You'll start getting
your powers back...

1036
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:30,940
and be flying and
breaking things...

1037
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:33,740
and saving people
before you know it.

1038
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:52,500
Well it's like I said
we were built in pairs.

1039
01:22:52,670 --> 01:22:57,630
And when we get close to our
opposites we lose our power.

1040
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:04,390
- Why? - So we can
live human lives.

1041
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:07,440
Love connect...

1042
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:12,570
grow old die.

1043
01:23:13,610 --> 01:23:16,450
What happened to us?

1044
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:22,740
Summer of 4 B.C.

1045
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:26,830
We were becoming
mortal like now.

1046
01:23:27,330 --> 01:23:29,540
They came after me with swords.

1047
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:35,010
But you saved me.

1048
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:41,010
1850.

1049
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:43,390
They set our house on fire.

1050
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:47,430
You pulled me out of the flames.

1051
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,860
Eighty years ago.

1052
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:54,940
What happened then?

1053
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:58,150
We were living in Miami...

1054
01:23:58,650 --> 01:24:02,070
and a new movie was
playing in town.

1055
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,330
Frankenstein..

1056
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:08,750
And after...

1057
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:11,040
we walked down Flagler Street...

1058
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:15,170
and you took my hand and
you held it so tight.

1059
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:24,550
And they attacked
us in an alley.

1060
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:32,480
They hit you so hard.
There was so much blood.

1061
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,900
They wouldn't let me ride
in the ambulance with you.

1062
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:42,610
And by the time I got to the
hospital you were awake.

1063
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:48,290
But you didn't know me.

1064
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:53,000
So I left.

1065
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:56,960
Every time we're together...

1066
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:59,920
they come after you through me.

1067
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,770
You're built to save people
more than the rest of us.

1068
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:20,860
That's who you are.
You're a hero.

1069
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:25,160
The insurance
policy of the gods.

1070
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:28,910
Keep one alive. You.

1071
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:32,370
To protect this world.

1072
01:25:48,470 --> 01:25:49,510
Mary!

1073
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:53,350
Mom!

1074
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:54,900
- Mary!
- Stay down!

1075
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,520
Okay.

1076
01:26:07,950 --> 01:26:09,200
Mary?

1077
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:24,130
Stop.

1078
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,890
Oh no! No! Please!

1079
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:40,360
Stay down.

1080
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,910
Hey! Mary!

1081
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,620
Let's go get her up!

1082
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:59,290
Come on Chuck.
Let's go let's go.

1083
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,340
- Morphine. - Here.
- Help in here!

1084
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,260
Hold her down. Hold her down.

1085
01:27:15,310 --> 01:27:16,350
Hold her down.

1086
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,110
Hold her down.

1087
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:35,620
- You want the monitor now?
- Stay calm.

1088
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:54,930
- Hold her hold her hold her.
- Need EKG leads.

1089
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:32,430
Upon us all Hancock.

1090
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:34,550
You're no different.

1091
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:42,560
Time to shut her down Hancock.

1092
01:28:42,730 --> 01:28:44,980
It's been a nice run.

1093
01:29:13,390 --> 01:29:17,350
Oh we are all sincerely
gonna miss you.

1094
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:21,140
But it is time for
you to move on.

1095
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:28,020
And maybe to a happier place.

1096
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:32,530
You can thank me
if you want to...

1097
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:35,320
superhero.

1098
01:29:45,710 --> 01:29:47,340
You didn't!

1099
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:54,800
Aaron!

1100
01:33:05,530 --> 01:33:10,120
- What about Attila the Hun?
- Completely cross-eyed.

1101
01:33:10,290 --> 01:33:11,370
- Cross-eyed?
- Yep.

1102
01:33:11,540 --> 01:33:14,330
All right what about
Queen Elizabeth?

1103
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:18,170
- Needy. - J.F.K.?
- What about him?

1104
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:21,220
Oh yeah.

1105
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:24,590
"Oh yeah"? Anything more?

1106
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:27,510
Not like that. I was in Cuba
for the whole missile thing.

1107
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,770
Yeah hang on.

1108
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:33,060
- Hello?
- Ray.

1109
01:33:33,230 --> 01:33:35,190
Hey I've been trying
to call you..

1110
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,110
Yeah I was out of cell range.

1111
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:42,650
- Are you outside?
- -Yeah..

1112
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:46,280
- Look up. - All right
I'm looking up.

1113
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:48,870
I'm looking up.

1114
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:57,090
- Baby?
- What?

1115
01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:06,680
You're gonna change the world.

1116
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:10,270
- Good job Ray.
- Oh my God Ray.

1117
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:13,980
Hey. Look up.

1118
01:34:14,690 --> 01:34:16,150
Hancock.

1119
01:34:20,690 --> 01:34:22,490
I'm proud of you.

1120
01:34:22,650 --> 01:34:24,490
Thanks.

1121
01:34:26,610 --> 01:34:29,080
Will I get in trouble for that?

1122
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,610
- Freeze!
- Don't move!

1123
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:49,950
- Oh my God! Sam! No!
- Drop your weapon sir!

1124
01:35:50,110 --> 01:35:51,530
Get back! Get back! Get back!

1125
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:54,200
- Drop it! - Get back or
I'll shoot! Get back!

1126
01:35:54,370 --> 01:35:56,000
Get back! I'm not playing.

1127
01:35:56,410 --> 01:35:59,210
Get back. Get back!

1128
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:01,920
Damn Handjob. Where
you come from?

1129
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:04,250
All right relax. Just
tell me what you need.

1130
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:06,760
Tell them cops to take
their guns off of me.

1131
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:09,180
- All right. - Tell them
to take the guns off me.

1132
01:36:09,340 --> 01:36:11,180
Just take them off.
Lower your weapons.

1133
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:15,680
You're gonna get us out of here with
that tight-ass Wolverine outfit on.

1134
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:20,000
Now let's make it
happen asshole.
