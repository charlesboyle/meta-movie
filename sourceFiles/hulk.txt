1
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,400
There's simply no way to shield
against every weaponized agent.

2
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,300
Instead, I can make
super-immune systems...

3
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,100
by strengthening
the human cellular response.

4
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,100
Banner, I know
where you're going.

5
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,300
But manipulating the immune system
is dangerous and stupid.

6
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,300
The president's science advisors
made it absolutely clear...

7
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,300
no human subjects.

8
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
David, I have wonderful news.

9
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,700
I'm gonna have a baby.

10
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,300
What's it gonna be?  Whoa, look at that,
Bruce. Huh?  Want a dinosaur?

11
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,000
Let's have a little fight.

12
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,400
You don't scare me.

13
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,700
That's a delicious eyeball.  Ooh, you're big
and green and scary.  I'm gonna run away.

14
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,900
Really, speaking of Cheryl,
guess what...

15
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,000
Bruce, you're hurt!

16
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,100
Jack hit him with the stick,
but Bruce wouldn't hit him back.

17
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,800
He just stood there, shaking.

18
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,900
It's okay.

19
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,900
Yeah, strange
he didn't make a peep.

20
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,400
Any other kid
would've wailed his head off.

21
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,100
That's Bruce. He's like that.

22
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,700
He's just so... bottled up.

23
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,000
The samples we found in your lab...
they were human blood.

24
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,000
You've ignored protocol.

25
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,700
You had no right
snooping around in my lab.

26
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,800
That's my business.

27
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,800
Wrong, Banner.  It's government business,
and you're off the project.

28
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,800
Attention, all personnel.
Fail-safe has been initiated.

29
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,500
Gamma decontamination
will occur in 30 minutes!

30
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,300
Evacuate immediately!

31
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,700
I repeat, evacuate immediately!

32
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,800
- Edith?
- David, what's going on?

33
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,100
- I gotta talk to you, Edith.
- Bruce, stay here.

34
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,200
What are you doing?

35
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,200
What are you doing?

36
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,200
I'm trying to tell you
what has to be done!

37
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,700
David, please stop it!
No!

38
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,900
No! No!
Yes!

39
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,400
David! No!

40
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,400
Bruce.

41
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,500
Bruce, wake up, son.

42
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,500
Bruce. Bruce.

43
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,300
Another nightmare?

44
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,900
I don't know.

45
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't remember.

46
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,600
Hi, Mom.

47
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,900
Already off to college.

48
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,000
Gonna miss you terribly.

49
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,900
I'll miss you too.

50
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,000
Please, come here.

51
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,000
Look at you.

52
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,100
Soon to be a great scientist.

53
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,000
I guess.

54
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,100
- I mean, who knows?
- I do.

55
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,300
There's something inside you...
so special.

56
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,300
Some kind of greatness.

57
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
I'm sure someday you're gonna...

58
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,900
share it with the whole world.

59
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,700
But as far as I'm concerned,
security oughta be...

60
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,700
Good morning, Dr. Krenzler.

61
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,600
Security oughta be beefed up.  In a
place like this you can't be too careful

62
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,000
Bruce!  Big day.

63
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,000
- Did you sleep?  I didn't sleep.
- I slept okay.

64
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,500
- Is Betty here?
- She's around.

65
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,700
I really gotta say, seeing you
in that stylin' head wear...

66
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,000
You're implying something
about my helmet?

67
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,000
You look like a massive nerd,
even around other scientists.

68
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Can I just ask... Were you wearing
the helmet while she dumped you?

69
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,900
See, it protects my very
important brain, Harper.

70
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,100
Go prep the samples.

71
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,600
- Hey. I found you.
- Betty, hey.

72
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I hate them.

73
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,400
-Wait, I just got here.  Who do we hate?
-The review board.

74
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,300
We have to make a
presentation on Tuesday.

75
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,600
And you're gonna make it with me.

76
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,800
You think I should?

77
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,300
Yeah, you're great with that stuff.

78
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,400
You start talking about microbes and
nanomeds, you sound almost... passionate

79
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,100
I'm sorry.

80
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
That was rude.

81
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,800
Look, nobody expects this
to be easy,

82
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,000
us working together
after being... so close.

83
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,100
We were close?

84
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,500
Look, if I could be more...

85
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,400
whatever, you know...

86
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,700
- I'm... just...
- Don't.

87
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,100
It's not your fault, really.

88
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,200
You're just a by-product...

89
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,200
of my inexplicable obsession
with emotionally distant men.

90
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,300
I'll get over us.

91
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
Good for you.

92
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,200
Anyway, I'm just really stressed
about this review.

93
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,400
If we don't get impressive results today,
we're gonna have a really hard sell come Tuesday.

94
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,900
Well, then, let's go be impressive.

95
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,700
Harper?

96
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,600
Ready when you are.
Let's hit it.

97
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,300
Are we passing inspection?

98
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,800
Safeties all going green.

99
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,900
Countdown's started.

100
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,000
Nanomeds released.

101
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,100
Four seconds.

102
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,900
Okay, nanomeds fully dispersed.

103
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,200
Okay, let's hit Freddie
with the gamma radiation.

104
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,300
Gamma exposure.

105
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,100
Nanomeds now active.

106
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,900
Nanomeds replicating cells on border.

107
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,100
It's working.

108
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,400
Cell copy to disassemble ratio
holding within one percent.

109
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,500
Imbalanced nanomed activity.

110
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,200
You wanna go to the review board
on Monday and tell 'em...

111
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,200
we've developed a brand-new
method for exploding frogs?

112
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,500
Yeah, I think maybe
there's a market for it.

113
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,000
I mean, what if there's a plague?

114
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,800
What have you had, Betty,
like, one beer?

115
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,800
I'm just sa...
I'm just saying, you know,

116
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,300
frogs start falling from the sky,

117
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,700
who do they come to?

118
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,700
We'd be world-renowned.

119
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,000
Make any parents proud.

120
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,100
I bet they would be.

121
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,100
They actually did
want me to be a scientist.

122
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
I mean, your birth parents.

123
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,000
Guess we'll never know.

124
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,000
I don't understand why you don't
want to find out about them.

125
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,400
They're dead.  They died before
I can remember anything.

126
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,400
Why do you always
come back to this?

127
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,800
Don't know.

128
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,100
I guess I figure there's more
to you than you like to show.

129
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,300
I guess there couldn't be any less

130
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,500
Right. So now we come
full circle back to that.

131
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,500
Nice work, Betty.

132
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Betty.

133
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,700
- Glen.
- Hey.

134
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,800
Hi.

135
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
Hi.

136
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,400
What happened
to your uniform?

137
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,600
Oh, I, uh...
I switched over.

138
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,100
I'm still working with your father, but...

139
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,700
Well, you know, the military's subcontracting
out all the most interesting work, and...

140
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,300
Can't argue with a paycheck.

141
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,300
I basically run
all the labs on the base now.

142
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,300
Oh.

143
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,100
Hey, you're uh...

144
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,200
you're looking good.

145
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,500
You're the genetics expert.

146
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,600
Ah, the good old college days.

147
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,000
So, how's business?

148
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,000
What do you want?

149
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,500
All right, I'll cut to the chase.

150
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,500
I've been hearing interesting things
about what you guys are doing here

151
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,500
Your little molecular machines
have some incredible implications.

152
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,500
How would you like to
come work for Atheon?

153
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,500
Get paid 10 times as much
as you earn now...

154
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,300
and own a piece of the patents.

155
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,100
You just have to say the word.

156
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,200
Two words: The door.

157
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,400
General?

158
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Come in.

159
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,300
Talbot wanted you to see this, sir.

160
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,300
It's about a lab Atheon is targeting for
acquisition and removal to desert base

161
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,800
Why isn't it
going through N.S.C.?

162
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,100
It, uh, concerns
your daughter, sir.

163
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,500
Hi. Sorry.

164
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,200
Hey, what happened to Benny?  Is he
not working the night shift anymore?

165
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,400
Benny's dead.

166
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,700
I'm the new guy.

167
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,800
Oh.

168
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Good to meet you.
Same.

169
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,900
- Let's try another.

170
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,700
Mmm, no. Stay here.

171
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,900
I look tired anyway.

172
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,200
Yeah, but you look great.

173
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,800
What's the matter?

174
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,400
It's these dreams, Doctor.

175
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,700
I keep having them,
and they're terrible.

176
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,500
Tell me about your dream.

177
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,600
Well, it starts...

178
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,900
it starts with a memory...
I think it's my first memory.

179
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,000
It's this image I have...

180
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,000
from when I was
maybe two years old.

181
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,100
Do you think
it's just a dream?

182
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,500
No, I think it's something
that happened...

183
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,500
when I was living at a desert base
with my father.

184
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,500
Anyhow,

185
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,000
the dream goes on and...

186
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,000
suddenly I'm alone.

187
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,500
That's terrible.

188
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,900
You know I'd never hurt you.

189
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
Hey there.

190
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,600
What's your name, darlin'?

191
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,400
Eh? What's your name?

192
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,700
Okay.

193
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,800
It's okay.

194
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,300
I gotta talk to you, Edith.

195
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Bruce, stay here!

196
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,600
"C... T... G...

197
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,900
A... G."

198
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,200
Bruce.

199
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,300
My Bruce.

200
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,200
Good morning.
Glen dropped by.

201
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,200
What's he doing here?

202
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,900
You know, Dr. Krenzler,

203
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,900
you and I have never had the chance
to get to know each other properly.

204
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:25,000
Well, that's because I don't want to get
to know you, properly or improperly.

205
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,100
So leave.

206
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,200
Hey, no worries.

207
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,700
Let me give you a little heads-up.

208
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,200
There is a hairsbreadth
between friendly offer...

209
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,100
and hostile takeover.

210
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,100
I've done my homework.  The work
you're doing here is dynamite.

211
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,200
Think: Gls embedded with technology...

212
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,800
that makes them instantly
repairable on the battlefield...

213
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,000
in our sole possession.

214
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,500
That's a hell of a business.

215
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,300
Well, it's not what we're doing here.
We're doing the basic science for everyone

216
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,000
You know, someday
I'm gonna write a book...

217
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,000
and I'm gonna call it When Stupid Ideals
Happen To Smart, Penniless Scientists.

218
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,100
In the meantime, Bruce,
you will be hearing from me.

219
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
About Glen, I, um...

220
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,500
There's nothing to talk about.

221
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,800
Okay.

222
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,800
I just wanted to say, don't worry
about him... I'll handle it.

223
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,200
How?

224
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,300
I'm gonna call my father,

225
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,500
ask him to exert some pressure.

226
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,900
Last I heard, you and your father
weren't speaking.

227
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,900
Hmm.

228
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,900
Well...

229
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,600
I guess now I have something
to talk with him about.

230
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,100
I think this circuit's kinda fried.

231
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,000
I don't know.  Maybe you 
anna come take a look at it

232
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,400
Okay, I'll be right there.

233
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,900
Aah!

234
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,300
The gamma's too high!
Bruce, I can't stop it!

235
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,000
Harper, get out!

236
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,700
Get out!

237
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,500
How's Harper?

238
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,500
He's all right.

239
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,400
You saved him.

240
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,400
I don't think he's coming back
to the lab for a while, though.

241
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,300
I don't understand
how this is possible.

242
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,300
You should be dead.

243
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,900
They worked... the nanomeds.

244
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,100
I mean, I feel great.

245
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,500
I feel like... I don't know.
They must have, like, fixed me.

246
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,200
Bruce, they've killed everything else
that they've come into contact with.

247
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,500
Are you sure
the doctor checked?

248
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,500
The doctor gave me
the full workup.

249
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,800
He wants to know where
he can get what I'm taking.

250
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,800
I'm a hundred percent.

251
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,800
More.

252
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,200
What do you mean?

253
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,200
Remember my bad knee?

254
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,700
Well, now it's my good knee.

255
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,200
Bruce, this isn't funny.

256
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,300
I was watching you.

257
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,800
You were gonna die,
and I was gonna have to watch you die.

258
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,600
Betty...

259
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,700
I'm sorry.

260
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,000
Really.

261
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,600
Hey, I'm not gonna explode.
Okay?

262
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,600
Yeah.

263
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,800
You should get some rest.

264
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,900
And I'm fine. Really.

265
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,300
I've never felt better.

266
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,800
Your name is not Krenzler.

267
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,100
It's Banner.

268
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,600
- What?
- Your name...

269
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,400
it's Banner.

270
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,100
Bruce Banner.

271
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,000
Bruce.

272
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,300
How did you get in here?
I work here now.

273
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,100
In the labs.
The late shift.

274
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,100
It keeps me close to you.

275
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:32,500
You always work so late yourself
with your friend Miss Ross.

276
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,900
No, no. Please. Please.
Let me.

277
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,600
You're not well.

278
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,400
You've had a terrible accident.

279
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,500
You're wondering
why you're still alive.

280
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,700
You're thinking
there's something inside.

281
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,200
Something different...

282
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,100
inexplicable.

283
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,400
I can help you understand,

284
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,500
if you'll let me.

285
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,300
If you'll...

286
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,300
forgive me.

287
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,900
Look, mister, I'm sure I have
nothing to forgive you for.

288
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,400
So perhaps you should leave now.

289
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,400
I'll be fine.

290
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,500
You must know.

291
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,800
You may not want to believe it,

292
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,500
but I can see it in your eyes.

293
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,200
So much like your mother's.

294
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,000
Of course,
you're my flesh and blood.

295
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,100
But then, you're something else too,
aren't you?

296
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,500
My physical son,

297
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,100
but the child of my mind too.

298
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,200
No.

299
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,200
You're lying.

300
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,100
My parents died
when I was a small boy.

301
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,600
No, no, that's not true.
That's what they wanted you to believe.

302
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,000
The experiments, the accident...
all top secret.

303
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,100
They put me away for 30 years.

304
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,600
Thirty years!

305
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,900
Away from you.

306
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,900
Away from our work.

307
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,100
But they couldn't keep me forever.

308
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,800
After all, I'm sane.
They had to admit it.

309
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,100
You see,

310
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,200
everything...

311
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,600
your extraordinary mind...

312
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,500
has been seeking all these years...

313
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,200
it's been inside you.

314
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,400
Now we will understand it.

315
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,900
We will harness it.

316
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,200
No, don't answer it.
It's Miss Ross again.

317
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,700
There's something you need to know
about her, Bruce. Something troublesome

318
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,400
Let me protect you from her.

319
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,100
No. Get out.

320
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,500
- Bruce...
- Get out!

321
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,500
Sit!

322
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,200
We're gonna have to
watch that temper of yours.

323
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,600
You sure you're okay?

324
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,700
Yeah, just glad to be out of bed

325
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,500
Got a message from my father.

326
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,600
He's coming to see me.

327
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,500
Your father?

328
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,300
When?

329
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,300
Lands in about an hour.

330
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,200
The funny thing is, he called me.

331
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,300
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, Betty.

332
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,900
- Here, ma'am.
- Thanks.

333
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,500
- You're welcome.  Sir?
- Thank you.

334
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,000
You're welcome.

335
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,000
Look, I'm gonna get right to it.

336
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
It's about Glen, isn't it?

337
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,700
He's been snooping around my lab.

338
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,700
Glen noticed some things,

339
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,600
asked me to make some inquiries.

340
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,100
Are you here to...

341
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,200
question me?

342
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,800
No.

343
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,700
We've turned up
some surprising things.

344
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,500
This Krenzler you work with...

345
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,200
you know who he really is?

346
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,300
How much do you
actually know about him?

347
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,300
I think the question is,

348
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,100
what is it
that you know about him?

349
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:51,200
- Well, right now, I'm not...
- Not at liberty to disclose it to me. Right

350
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,500
You know,

351
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,600
I think I was hoping that...

352
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,400
maybe this time you just...

353
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,800
honestly wanted to see me again.

354
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,500
- You've got this all wrong, Betty.
- Do I?

355
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,400
Yes. I do want to see you.

356
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I really wishthat I
could believe you.

357
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,600
Everything...

358
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,000
your extraordinary mind
has been seeking...

359
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,500
all these years,

360
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,300
it's been inside you.

361
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,100
Hi, you've called Dr. Krenzler.

362
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,100
Please leave a message
and I'll call you right back.

363
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,100
Bruce, hey. Are you there?

364
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,700
Look, um,
I think I screwed up.

365
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,300
My father... It's like he suspects
you of something. I don't know.

366
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,500
- I was so impatient, like always.

367
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,500
I didn't hear him out.
I don't know, l...

368
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,900
I just think that they're planning
something with the lab.

369
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,800
So, um, uh...

370
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,700
Call me. Okay?

371
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,600
Bye.

372
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,900
- Betty?

373
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,800
Dispatch! Dispatch!
We have a 415 at the lab!

374
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,300
Send Berkeley P.D. Now!
Send 'em now!

375
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,600
Watch out!

376
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,800
Edith?

377
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,800
David, what's going on?

378
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,000
- I gotta talk to you, Edith.
- Bruce, stay here.

379
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,400
My Bruce.

380
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,600
Bruce?

381
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,300
There was some sort of explosion.

382
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,900
They wouldn't let us
into the building.

383
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,700
I was worried about you.

384
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,300
Well, I'm okay.

385
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,200
What happened to you last night?

386
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,200
I had the most vivid dream.

387
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,400
It was like being born.

388
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,200
Coming up for air.
Light hitting my face.

389
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,300
Screaming.

390
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,700
My heartbeat...

391
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,400
it was, like, boom...

392
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,400
boom...

393
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,100
boom.

394
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,300
Were you at the lab?

395
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,400
No.

396
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,800
But something...

397
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,100
And there was that man.

398
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,100
The one with the dogs.

399
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,100
Who?

400
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,200
That new janitor.

401
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,700
He said he was my father.

402
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,000
I'll get it.

403
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,200
My father.

404
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,800
My, my.

405
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,100
So this is the young Bruce Ban...

406
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,800
Krenzler.

407
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,300
I think you left something
in your lab last night.

408
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,100
Mitchell.

409
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:59,000
Escort my daughter outside.
I'll join her shortly.

410
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,600
I'd rather stay here.

411
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,100
Now, Betty.

412
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,400
It's okay.

413
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,400
I'll be fine.

414
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,900
Keep him under observation.
I'll be back.

415
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,300
- What?
- Your friend in there.

416
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:38,200
There's a good chance he's caught
up in some very bad business.

417
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,200
Unfinished business.

418
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,300
And I promise you, I'm gonna
get to the bottom of it.

419
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,300
You have my word
I'll make sure he's cared for.

420
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,400
But as of right now,
he is incommunicado.

421
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,900
And for the next
few days at least,

422
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,800
you're gonna stay away from here.

423
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,900
For your own good.

424
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,900
Okay, and that's for the new guy
on the night shift, right?

425
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,000
Great. Thank you.
I appreciate it.

426
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,500
Dr. Ross.

427
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,400
How unexpected.

428
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,500
Please come in.

429
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,400
I'm sorry to just show up
at your house like this.

430
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,600
Uh...

431
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,900
I came to ask you something that...

432
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,700
I really have no business asking

433
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,800
He told you?

434
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,900
He said you talked to him.

435
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,900
Oh.

436
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Please sit down.

437
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:18,200
Bruce was at the lab last night.
He said that you were there too.

438
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,100
But he can't remember much about it

439
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,400
I need to find out what happened.

440
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,500
So, you want to know, uh,

441
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,600
what's wrong with him...

442
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,600
so you can fix him?

443
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,000
Cure him, change him.

444
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,500
My father's with the military.

445
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,500
He seems to think he's involved in
some kind of threat to national security

446
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,500
Mmm.

447
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,900
Your father. Ross.

448
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:50,800
You brought your father
down upon his head?

449
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,800
How little you understand,
Miss Ross,

450
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:57,800
and how dangerous
your ignorance has become.

451
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,800
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.

452
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,900
My son is...

453
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,300
unique.

454
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,300
That's why you can't relate to him.

455
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,900
And because he is unique, the world
will not tolerate his existence.

456
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,000
Will they?

457
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,100
But you...

458
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,600
you try,

459
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,500
don't you?

460
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,600
Yes.

461
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,200
And a very beautiful
woman like you,

462
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,100
your attentions...

463
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,900
can't be completely unwanted.

464
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,400
Can they?

465
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,000
No.

466
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:51,500
Not with eyes like yours,

467
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,400
watching expectantly,

468
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,600
lovingly.

469
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,000
But I'm afraid
we're both too late to help him.

470
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,300
There's nothing
I can do for him...

471
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,500
or for you.

472
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,600
Besides,

473
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,500
he's made it clear he wants
nothing to do with me.

474
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,500
His choice.

475
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:19,400
Now, if you'll excuse me, Miss Ross,
I have some work to do.

476
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,800
And don't worry about the dogs.

477
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,800
You'll be fine.

478
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,400
Just don't look 'em in the eyes.

479
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,800
Good-bye.

480
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,300
He gets released, and a month later
your lab is destroyed.

481
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,300
What a coincidence.

482
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,300
So you're not gonna tell me
where he is, are ya?

483
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,600
How many times do I have to tell you?
I'd like to help you, but I just don't know

484
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,100
You know who I am.
Right, Banner?

485
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,800
- Your Betty's father.
You're a high-ranking general.
- Let's cut the crap.

486
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:54,700
I'm the guy who had your father
tossed away, and a lot more like him,

487
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,400
and I'll do the same with you if I
feel so disposed. You understand?

488
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,000
If you had him tossed away,
then why are you asking me?

489
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:05,000
I don't remember.
I was always told my father was dead.

490
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,100
Don't play with me!

491
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,600
You were four years old
when you saw it.

492
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,100
When I saw what?

493
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,900
You were right there.  How could
anyone forget a thing like that?

494
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,100
What?

495
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:22,200
Oh, some more repressed memories.

496
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,400
Just tell me.

497
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,600
I'm sorry, son.

498
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,100
You're an even more screwed-up mess
than I thought you'd be.

499
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,600
Until we get
to the bottom of this,

500
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,600
your lab has been declared
a top-secret military site...

501
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,100
and you're not gonna get
a security clearance to get back into it...

502
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,200
or any other lab that's doing
anything more interesting than...

503
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,700
trying to figure out
the next generation of herbal hair gel.

504
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,400
One more thing.

505
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,500
If you ever...

506
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:06,100
come within a thousand yards
of my daughter again,

507
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,300
I'll put you away for the
rest of your natural life.

508
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,700
Dogs!

509
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,600
Go! Go get her!

510
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,600
And let nothing stand in your way!

511
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,100
Go!

512
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,100
Hello?

513
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,200
Bruce?

514
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:48,200
So, they think they can just
throw you away as they did me.

515
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,200
What's wrong with me?
What did you do to me?

516
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,200
I got a visit today.

517
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,700
A very unwelcome visit.

518
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,300
I'm afraid my hand is being forced

519
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,500
What did you do to me?

520
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,500
You so much want to know, don't you?

521
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:16,700
But I think no explanation
will serve you half as well...

522
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,400
as the experience.

523
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:24,200
In any case, I still don't
quite understand it myself.

524
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,300
If they'd only let me
work in peace...

525
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,400
Of course, my betters
would have none of that.

526
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,500
So you experimented
on yourself, didn't you?

527
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:37,200
And passed on to me... what?

528
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,800
An alteration. Genetic.

529
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,100
A deformity.
I guess you could call it that.

530
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,800
But an amazing strength too.

531
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,900
And now, finally unleashed,
I can harvest it.

532
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,800
No.

533
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,900
You'll do no such thing.

534
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,400
I will isolate it
and treat it myself.

535
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,900
I'll remove it and I'll kill it
before it does any real harm.

536
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,900
I'll bet you and your Betty
would love to destroy it.

537
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,100
But would you really
destroy part of yourself?

538
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,800
I don't think so.

539
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,800
And as for Betty,

540
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,800
I'm sending her a surprise visit...

541
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,300
from some four-legged
friends of mine.

542
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:20,800
You see, I managed to culture
some of your very own DNA, Bruce,

543
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,700
and the results are tremendous.

544
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:27,400
They're unstable, but very powerful.

545
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,100
What about my DNA?

546
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:35,200
Let's just wait and see what Betty
makes of the results, huh?

547
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,300
No. You're crazy.

548
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,300
I won't let you.

549
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,100
Get your hands off of me.
Talbot, what's this...

550
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,300
Inside, asshole.
I wanna talk to you.

551
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,400
Listen, my father's
going after Betty...

552
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,700
What makes you think you can go behind
my back and get Ross to cut me out, huh?

553
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,100
Listen to me!
Betty's in trouble!

554
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,500
You pathetic freak.

555
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,000
Betty's in danger.
I swear to you, she'll be killed.

556
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,900
I can state the obvious.

557
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:09,300
Something tells me you aren't in much of a
position to be making stupid threats to anyone

558
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,400
- Talbot.
- Yeah?

559
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,300
You're making me angry.

560
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,700
Oh, am I?

561
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,300
Ohh! Oh!

562
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,700
I got him! Open fire!

563
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,600
Bruce?

564
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,600
He sent these dogs, didn't he?

565
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:44,200
But I killed them!

566
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,100
My God.

567
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:13,900
It must be the nanomeds.
It must be the gamma exposure.

568
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,700
But we've never seen
any effect like this before.

569
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,700
No. Deeper.

570
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:22,300
The gamma just unleashed
what was already there.

571
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,900
Unleashed what?

572
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:28,000
Me.

573
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:30,800
It.

574
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,500
It's okay.

575
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:35,200
Shh. It's okay.

576
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,600
What were those animals?

577
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:42,700
My father sent them.

578
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,600
He is my father.

579
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,800
He wanted me to change.

580
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:51,100
He wanted me to change
into that mindless hulk.

581
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,300
Why would he want that?

582
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,100
Can you remember anything?

583
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:00,400
Is there anything
from when you were changed?

584
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:06,100
It was like a dream.

585
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,000
About what?

586
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,400
Rage.

587
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,800
Power.

588
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,900
And freedom.

589
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:41,000
Hello? Sir.

590
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,500
- Hello.
- Dad?

591
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:47,000
Betty! Are you all right?

592
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:52,700
I'm scared.
I need your help.

593
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,900
Where are you?

594
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,600
How are you?

595
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,300
Okay, I guess.

596
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:16,400
I think that somehow...

597
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:19,700
your anger is triggering
the nanomeds.

598
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:24,100
How could it?  We designed them
to respond to physical damage.

599
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:27,300
Emotional damage
can manifest physically.

600
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:31,000
Like what?

601
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,200
Serious trauma.

602
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,200
Repressed memories.

603
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:50,400
Your father grilled me about something that
happened to me from early childhood...

604
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,800
that I'm supposed to remember.

605
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,400
He did?

606
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:59,400
It sounded bad,
but... I honestly don't remember.

607
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:05,100
The thing that worries me...

608
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:07,200
is...

609
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,400
a physical wound is finite,

610
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,500
but with emotions,

611
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:15,300
what's to say it won't
just go on and on...

612
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:18,800
and start a chain reaction?

613
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,600
You know what scares me the most?

614
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,600
When it happens,

615
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:31,000
when it comes over me...

616
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:34,100
and I totally lose control,

617
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I like it.

618
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:57,700
It's okay. I got you.
I'm sorry.

619
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,500
You'll be okay.
It's just to make you sleep.

620
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:03,500
Target down.
Target secure.

621
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:06,400
I'm going to take you someplace safe

622
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,500
Okay? Bruce?

623
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:12,100
Bruce?

624
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,100
Bruce?

625
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,200
Clear!

626
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,800
- Attention on deck.
- Carry on.

627
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,600
We're buried out here
in the middle of nowhere.

628
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:16,200
How long are you
gonna keep him sedated?

629
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:18,500
For the rest of his
natural life, if I have to.

630
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,400
You said I could trust you.
I'm your father.

631
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,700
You can trust me to do what I think
is right, not what you think you want

632
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,800
- He is a human being.
- He is also something else.

633
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,400
Suppose he gets out,
has one of his little mood swings...

634
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:35,000
in a populated area.

635
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:39,600
Yes, I'm aware of the potential danger.
I'm also aware that he saved my life.

636
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,600
Yeah, from a mutant
French poodle.

637
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:45,100
I'm indebted to him for that.

638
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:48,600
He also put three men in a hospital,
and Talbot's barely walking!

639
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,900
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to help him!

640
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:56,800
- Why is he such a threat to you?
- Because I know what he comes from.

641
01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:01,000
He is his father's son,
every last molecule of him.

642
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:03,700
He says he doesn't know his father

643
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:09,100
but he's workin'in the same
exact goddamn field his father did.

644
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:13,500
So either he's lyin'...
or it's somethin' worse, and he's...

645
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:15,700
What?

646
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:19,500
Predestined to follow
in his father's footsteps?

647
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,900
I was gonna say "damned."

648
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,600
Of course you were.

649
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,100
But I'm a scientist.

650
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:32,600
As a scientist, I believe we can figure
this out and he can be helped.

651
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,000
I know you do.

652
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:39,500
Look, whether you know or care,

653
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:43,100
I've got a lot of pride
in what you've done.

654
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:46,200
But this is too big for you.

655
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:50,300
Look, I know the government thinks
they have a weapon on their hands.

656
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:53,000
Otherwise, he'd be dead by now.

657
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,400
They can probe and prod
all they want,

658
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,800
and in the meanwhile,
just let me try to help him.

659
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:01,200
Nobody knows him better than I do

660
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,900
What did David Banner do to him?

661
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,800
Cover left!
Clear left.

662
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,700
Cover right!

663
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:28,300
What's happening here?

664
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,900
My hand.

665
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:36,500
You see, the strength
of my son's DNA...

666
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:40,800
combined with nanomed
reconstruction...

667
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:47,300
You see, I can partake
with the essences of all things.

668
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,700
Gonna have to ask you to...

669
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:54,800
put your hands up, pal, okay?

670
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,300
Nice and easy.

671
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:05,300
Do you really believe...

672
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:10,000
that I am separate from you?

673
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,400
Whoa!

674
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:29,200
Where am I?

675
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,100
You're home.

676
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:50,300
It's hard to believe
we used to live here.

677
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:55,900
I must have seen you or known you.

678
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:58,800
If only I could remember.

679
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:35,500
This is my old house, isn't it?

680
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,200
Let's go.

681
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,900
Please try.

682
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:16,100
What is it?

683
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:18,200
Nothing.

684
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,300
Really?

685
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,200
Damn it.

686
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:33,900
Okay, Betty...
what do you want to know?

687
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,000
What was in that room?

688
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,600
What are you afraid that I'll see?

689
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,700
See? There's nothing.

690
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,900
It's empty.

691
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:20,600
What do you mean,
I don't have access to him?

692
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:26,000
NSA has decided to turn over study
of the, uh... the threat to Atheon.

693
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,700
But you're head of the base.

694
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,200
I thought you were in charge.

695
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:35,800
But I don't set policy,
and I still take orders.

696
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:42,200
I can't believe Talbot
would go around me like this!

697
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:47,300
Oh, there's a lot of powerful people
that want in on this.

698
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,700
And money to be made...
lots of it.

699
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:58,900
You know the worst part
about all this?

700
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:02,000
When I had David Banner locked up
and sent that kid away,

701
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:06,300
I didn't give that boy a second thought;
he was just collateral damage.

702
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:09,500
Well, he isn't anymore, is he?

703
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,900
What can I do?

704
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,300
You can go home now.

705
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:22,600
I'd tell you to go and say good-bye,
but I've already been informed...

706
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,400
that for now all further contact
is out of the question.

707
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,200
Right.

708
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:12,000
Hiya, Bruce. How ya feelin'?
Grub okay in here for ya?

709
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,400
What do you want?

710
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,900
That's a good question.

711
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,600
See, I need your cells to trigger
some chemical distress signals.

712
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:25,600
You know, so you can turn
a little green for me again...

713
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,900
and I can carve off
a piece of the real you,

714
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:32,000
analyze it, patent it,
make a fortune.

715
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:35,900
Do you mind?

716
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,100
I'll never let you.

717
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,800
I'm not sure you've got
much of a choice.

718
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:46,000
Come on, Bruce.
Aren't you feeling a little angry?

719
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:50,300
After all, you've only got me to play with now
that Betty's dumped you and gone back to Berkeley

720
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:52,200
You're lying.

721
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,700
You know, for me
this is a win-win situation.

722
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,200
You turn green, and all these guys
come in and kill you...

723
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:59,100
and I perform the autopsy.

724
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:02,100
You don't...

725
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,200
And I mop the floor with you...

726
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,200
and maybe by accident
go too far and break your neck.

727
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:11,500
Bad science, maybe...
but personally gratifying.

728
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:17,600
Come on, Bruce!
Let's see what you got.

729
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:20,200
Never.

730
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,100
You know, consciously
you may control it,

731
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:31,800
but subconsciously,
I bet that's another story.

732
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:05,600
All right, let's jump-start
those brain waves.

733
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,700
Bruce.

734
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,100
- My dear Miss Ross.

735
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:36,100
Welcome back.

736
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:38,800
There are two guards
right outside.

737
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:44,000
You don't have to worry.
I'm not angry with you. Not anymore.

738
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,400
What do you want?

739
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:49,600
It's over for me now.
I know that.

740
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:53,400
And soon it'll be over for Bruce.

741
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,900
That's why I've come to you...

742
01:27:56,100 --> 01:28:00,100
to ask you if you could
persuade your father,

743
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,000
as a man, as a father himself,

744
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:07,700
that if I turn myself in now,
peacefully...

745
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:11,300
and before
he puts me away forever,

746
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:14,300
that he would let me see my son...

747
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:17,000
for one last time.

748
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:19,800
Could you do that for me?

749
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:25,100
It's out of my father's hands now.

750
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:33,000
I understand.
He's a puppet now.

751
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:36,700
I don't blame him.
You shouldn't.

752
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:40,400
You should blame yourself
for what you've done to your son.

753
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:44,300
And what have I done
to my son, Miss Ross?

754
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:49,600
Nothing. I tried to improve
on the limits in myself.

755
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:52,100
Myself! Not him!

756
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:55,700
Can you understand?
To improve on nature.

757
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,800
My nature!
Knowledge of oneself!

758
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,800
It's the only path to the truth...

759
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:05,800
that give men the power
to go beyond God's boundaries!

760
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,200
You know what's beyond
your boundaries? Other people.

761
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:14,400
All you've given Bruce is fear.

762
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:19,500
Fear of life.

763
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:23,600
Fear?

764
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:27,000
Perhaps, Miss Ross.

765
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:31,400
And loneliness too.

766
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:36,200
Yes... I feel them both.

767
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,600
But I have lived...
completely once.

768
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,700
I was so much in love,

769
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:52,800
and she so much wanted a baby.

770
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:54,800
My baby.

771
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:05,300
I could tell
from the moment she conceived...

772
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:08,300
that it wasn't a son
I had given her...

773
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:10,700
but something else.

774
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:13,200
A monster, maybe.

775
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:16,000
I should have put a stop to it
right then,

776
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:20,500
but I was curious
and that was my downfall.

777
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:24,500
And as I watched this tiny life unfold,

778
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,900
I began to imagine the horror of it,

779
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:32,300
and my curiosity was replaced...

780
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:35,400
with compassion.

781
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:40,400
But they took away
my chance to cure him.

782
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,900
Your father threw me out.

783
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,400
- What are you doing?
- I remember that day so well...

784
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:49,200
every moment, every sensation...

785
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,600
walking into the house,

786
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,900
the feeling of the handle
of the knife in my hand.

787
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:59,900
I knew I was doing a father's work,
fulfilling a father's mercy.

788
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:03,100
David, please stop it! No!

789
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:05,600
David, no!
Talk to me! Listen!

790
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:08,600
But then she surprised me.

791
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:12,400
- No! No!

792
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:14,600
David, no!

793
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:17,800
It was as if...

794
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,300
she and the knife...

795
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:24,000
merged.

796
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,900
No!

797
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:37,600
You cannot imagine...

798
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:41,300
the unbearable finality of it.

799
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,900
And in that one moment...

800
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:49,100
I took everything that was dear to me...

801
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:53,600
and transformed it into nothing more...

802
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,800
than a memory.

803
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:14,400
Bingo! That must be some
jumbo nightmare he just had.

804
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,300
Okay, do it now.
Start the enzyme extraction.

805
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,400
Sir, negative on drill penetration.

806
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:32,200
Damn it, drill him harder! Give him full RPMs
Come on, Holeman! Come on!

807
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:50,700
-Should I neutralize?
-No, I can't do anything with goop, c'mon on

808
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,000
- All right, put him to sleep.

809
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:17,300
It's not stopping him!

810
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,900
Ready room, send in
our containment team.

811
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:29,700
Non-lethals only.
I repeat, non-lethals only.

812
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:32,000
I must have a sample of him.

813
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,100
Sir!

814
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:39,100
- Jesus!
- Hit him with the foam.

815
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:41,200
Deploy containment foam.

816
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:44,200
Talbot, talk to me.

817
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:49,100
Under control, General. I'll let
you know if we need you.

818
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:51,900
Unacceptable.  Unseat your
asses down here immediately.

819
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,100
I want a full-court evacuation now.

820
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:56,600
I'm shutting you down.
Lockdown.

821
01:33:56,700 --> 01:33:59,400
-Didn't you hear what the general said?
-I said lockdown!

822
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,600
Clear! I need a sample of him!

823
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:09,900
Take it easy there, buddy.

824
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:13,800
This might give you
a bit of a sting here, Bruce.

825
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:29,300
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Clear your weapon! Clear it!

826
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:32,900
- Give me the M2.
- So long, big boy.

827
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:35,500
Clear!

828
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:48,500
Lockdown the entire facility immediately

829
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,700
Target's still moving towards blue level

830
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:59,000
- Evacuate the main hall.

831
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:06,900
Send in backup, heavy weapons.
Issue general quarters.

832
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,800
Set firing lines left and right!

833
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:12,500
Heavy weapons, go, go, go!

834
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,500
Contamination, sir.
System readings are redline.

835
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:38,800
Data's on backup power supply.

836
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:48,000
Incoming!

837
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:57,300
-Shut down all power to the main hall
-Sir?

838
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:01,900
Show him the way out.
We'll fight him outside.

839
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:13,600
Driver, stop.
Driver, stop.

840
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:23,100
Gunner, traverse left!
Traverse left!

841
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:07,600
Clear back! Clear back!

842
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:05,900
Mr. President,
I have some bad news, sir.

843
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:08,100
Let's have it, General.

844
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:11,300
I've briefed the president on Angry Man.
I assume that's what this is about.

845
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:16,100
It is, ma'am. I'm requesting
a National Command Authority override.

846
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:19,000
Angry Man is unsecure.

847
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:23,400
I need everything we have at my disposal
in order to stop his movement.

848
01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:27,000
You're expecting
civilian casualties, General?

849
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:29,500
Not if I can help it, ma'am.

850
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:31,800
Consider it done.  Keep us posted.

851
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,400
Contact Goodman Control.

852
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,800
Patch data to the assets.

853
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,700
Contact H.Q.

854
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,600
Have them initiate
an immediate evacuation...

855
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:36,800
in vicinity of grid coordinates
653-216...

856
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:13,200
Confirm that the area
has been cleared.

857
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:15,700
Confirm area cleared.

858
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:18,700
H.Q. Confirms area cleared.
Assets on-line, sir.

859
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,000
Gentlemen, it's time to dig in.

860
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:24,500
I want this target
stopped in his tracks.

861
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:16,100
Jesus.

862
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:34,700
Mayday! Mayday! Ah, shit!

863
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:44,700
Tango Four is down. Have C-SAR
respond to our 20 ASAP.

864
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:49,000
We're okay, but, damn it, get him
off us before he tears us apart!

865
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:51,700
I've got no shot.
Do you have a clear line of fire?

866
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,200
Watch it, Tango Flight.

867
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:56,500
Break left! Break left!

868
01:43:56,700 --> 01:44:00,000
Tango Three, pull back and set up
for a Hellfire shot.

869
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:02,600
Hold your fire till we draw him off.

870
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:05,000
Tango One is hot. Gun wazzed.

871
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:07,700
Roger. Going hot. Guns ready.

872
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:15,800
Engage at will.

873
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,900
Tango One, pull back!
Clear my line!

874
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,900
Tango Flight, clear back.
I've got him painted for Hellfire.

875
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:45,500
Roger that. Tango One clear.
Take the shot.

876
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:06,900
Tango One, Tango Three.
I have contact.

877
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,400
Holy shit! He's got my missile!

878
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:13,300
Mayday! Mayday!

879
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,300
Mayday! Mayday!
We're hit! We're going down!

880
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:24,700
Give me a head count.

881
01:45:24,700 --> 01:45:27,800
Tango Three, give me a sit rep.

882
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:31,600
Our kite's busted up,
but we're okay.

883
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:35,200
Tango Flight, do you have
eyes on the target?

884
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:38,500
Tango One, I have him in the rocks.

885
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:41,600
Salvo all. Turn it into a parking lot.

886
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:04,600
T-bolt, your parking lot is ready.

887
01:46:04,700 --> 01:46:07,400
We're bingo for fuel and ammo.
R. T.B.

888
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:36,600
T-bolt, this is Goodman Control.

889
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:40,200
Be advised, target not destroyed.
He's on the move again.

890
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:42,200
Damn!

891
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,700
I've got it.

892
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:47,000
It appears he's heading home.

893
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:49,000
Launch fast movers.

894
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:52,600
Have them intercept and engage.

895
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:55,000
Hello?

896
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:58,500
Betty, Bruce got out.
He's headed your way...

897
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:00,500
and probably right for you.

898
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:02,800
How far from the base are you?

899
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,000
I'm already here.
They're taking his father in now.

900
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:09,800
That's all good news.
Stay there, Betty.

901
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:26,700
Legend One rolling in hot.
Legend Two breaking offleft.

902
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:30,900
I think I can come back around
for a gun attack.

903
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,200
Acquire a clear target.
Fire at will.

904
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:42,400
Increase altitude.
Civilian aircraft in vicinity.

905
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:49,800
Pull up! Pull up!
You're headed for the bridge!

906
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:54,000
I can't pull up! I can't pull up!

907
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:05,500
Okay, you've got him now. Take him
on a ride to the top of the world.

908
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:08,500
Let's see what the thin air
will do for him.

909
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:10,700
Initiating afterburner.

910
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:30,300
I'm passing flight level 600.

911
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:32,500
This is out of my envelope.

912
01:48:32,700 --> 01:48:34,600
Hang in there, Legend.

913
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:38,100
I can't maintain.
He's all over my aerodynamics.

914
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:40,400
He'll lose consciousness before you.

915
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:49,500
Nine-fifty. I can't hold it.
I'm pulling back!

916
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:38,500
Puny human.

917
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,700
Contact. He's in the water.
All units, weapons hot.

918
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:53,000
Let's not take any chances.

919
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:56,500
You are cleared to fire
on target, Legend.

920
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:19,600
- Dad?
- Betty?

921
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:22,100
We don't have a choice.

922
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:24,600
I have to destroy him.

923
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:28,700
But you can't.  You will only fuel
his rage, and you will make him stronger

924
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:33,200
It's you he's coming for.
You know that.

925
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:36,900
Then let me go to him.

926
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:39,000
Please.

927
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:43,200
Just give him a chance to calm down

928
01:51:07,700 --> 01:51:11,400
This area has been declared
restricted airspace.

929
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:15,400
All aircraft are ordered
to clear the airspace immediately.

930
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:59,000
Echo, One-niner. Weapons are hot.

931
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:01,600
Target acquired.
Waiting your orders to engage.

932
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:04,400
Repeat, waiting
your orders to engage.

933
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:07,800
Command code yellow.
Hold for authorization.

934
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:19,300
All units, hold your fire.

935
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:22,700
This is T-bolt to all assets. You have
direct orders to hold your fire.

936
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,400
I repeat, hold your fire.

937
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:27,700
Echo, One-niner. Roger that.

938
01:52:41,900 --> 01:52:43,800
Go go, go, go, go, go!

939
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,800
Hold your fire until my command!

940
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:21,900
Engine 24 to command.
We are in position now.

941
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:31,900
You found me.

942
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:36,100
You weren't that hard to find.

943
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:39,700
Yes, I was.

944
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:47,100
Let's take a walk.

945
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:22,100
That's the deal, gentlemen.
He stays on this base...

946
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:26,500
until we get the final word from C-3
on how to dispose of him.

947
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:31,400
In the meantime, ifhe does
anything but sit there in that chair,

948
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:36,500
we're gonna turn on the juice
and he'll be incinerated immediately.

949
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:39,100
We've established a
200-yard perimeter, sir.

950
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:43,400
If we deploy the electromagnetic array,
there should be no collateral damage.

951
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:46,300
Here they come!

952
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:54,900
I'm doin' this for you, Betty.

953
01:56:55,100 --> 01:56:58,900
But one way or another, we're
gonna have to prepare for the worst.

954
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:50,300
I should have killed you.

955
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:54,100
And I should have killed you.

956
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:57,600
I wish you had.

957
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:04,600
I saw her last night.

958
01:59:06,900 --> 01:59:09,300
Saw her face.

959
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:11,400
Brown hair.

960
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:15,800
Brown eyes.

961
01:59:15,900 --> 01:59:18,700
She smiled at me.

962
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:22,400
She reached down and kissed my cheek

963
01:59:23,900 --> 01:59:27,100
I can almost remember a smell.

964
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:33,200
Almost like desert flowers.

965
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:36,800
Her favorite perfume.

966
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:43,700
It's my mother,
and I don't even know her name.

967
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:55,500
It's all right, son.
You go ahead and cry.

968
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:05,500
Go ahead and cry.

969
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:10,800
Cry. Crying will do you good.

970
02:00:11,100 --> 02:00:13,700
Don't touch me!

971
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:18,000
Maybe once you were my father,

972
02:00:18,100 --> 02:00:20,800
but you're not now
and you never will be.

973
02:00:20,900 --> 02:00:24,300
Oh, is that so?

974
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:30,100
Well, I got news for you.
I didn't come here to see you.

975
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:33,300
I came here to see my son.

976
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:36,800
My real son.

977
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,400
The one inside of you.

978
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:43,500
You're nothing but a superficial shell,

979
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:45,800
a husk of flimsy consciousness...

980
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:49,700
ready to be torn off
at a moment's notice.

981
02:00:49,900 --> 02:00:53,100
You can think what you like.
I don't care. Just go!

982
02:00:58,900 --> 02:01:02,200
No, son. Listen to me.
I found a cure.

983
02:01:02,300 --> 02:01:04,600
For me.

984
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:07,900
My cells can transform too,

985
02:01:08,100 --> 02:01:10,900
absorb enormous amounts of energy.

986
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:13,800
But, unlike you, they're unstable.

987
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:17,100
Son, I need your strength.

988
02:01:17,300 --> 02:01:20,400
I gave you life.

989
02:01:20,700 --> 02:01:24,400
Now you must give it back to me!

990
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:29,600
Only a million times
more radiant, more powerful!

991
02:01:29,900 --> 02:01:33,200
- Stop it.
- Stop? Stop what?

992
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:36,000
Stop what?

993
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:40,300
Think about all those men out there
in their uniforms...

994
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:43,900
barking and swallowing orders,

995
02:01:44,100 --> 02:01:47,400
inflicting their petty rule
over the entire globe!

996
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:50,700
Think of all the harm they've done!

997
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:53,800
To you! To me!

998
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,100
To humanity!

999
02:01:56,300 --> 02:01:59,200
And know this...
that we can make them...

1000
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:02,000
and their flags and their anthems
and their governments...

1001
02:02:02,100 --> 02:02:04,700
disappear in a flash!

1002
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:06,900
You in me.

1003
02:02:07,100 --> 02:02:09,200
I'd rather die.

1004
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:13,700
Oh, that's your answer?

1005
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,200
Then indeed you shall die...
and be reborn...

1006
02:02:18,300 --> 02:02:21,600
a hero... of the kind
that walked the earth...

1007
02:02:21,900 --> 02:02:25,500
long before the pale religions
of civilization...

1008
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:28,700
infected humanity's soul!

1009
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Go!

1010
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:48,400
Stop your bawling,

1011
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:51,900
you weak little speck
of human trash.

1012
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:01,300
All right... I'll go!

1013
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:05,700
- You just watch me go!
- Hit it.

1014
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:33,400
- Hit it again!

1015
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:37,200
We can't, sir. There's no power. Some
kind of counter-electromagnetic field.

1016
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:44,500
Move in and assault the target.
Move in!

1017
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:47,800
Move, move, move!

1018
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:39,700
Sir, I've located them on radar.
Pear Lake.

1019
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:42,100
Call up the task force.

1020
02:04:48,900 --> 02:04:51,200
Yes!

1021
02:05:55,700 --> 02:05:58,400
That's right. Keep fighting.

1022
02:05:58,700 --> 02:06:03,000
The more you fight,
the more of you I take.

1023
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:15,600
Strange. We're reading a phenomenal
drop in temperatures there.

1024
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:18,200
But simultaneous radiological activity.

1025
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:21,500
They're absorbing
all the ambient energy.

1026
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:35,000
Sleep now, Bruce, and forget forever.

1027
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:39,900
Struggle no more...
and give me all of your power.

1028
02:06:41,900 --> 02:06:45,700
You think you can live with it? Take it!

1029
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:49,600
Take it all!

1030
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:54,700
Oh, yes! Yes!

1031
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:11,500
Take it back!

1032
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:15,300
It's not stopping!

1033
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:17,700
Take it back!

1034
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,700
Gentlemen... release.

1035
02:07:45,100 --> 02:07:48,000
Gamma charge away.

1036
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:12,900
- Mwah!
- Sweet dreams.

1037
02:09:06,700 --> 02:09:09,600
- Hello?
- Betty, is that you?

1038
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:12,100
- Hi, Dad.
- I'm glad I caught you.

1039
02:09:12,300 --> 02:09:15,200
- I'm glad you called.
- Thanks.

1040
02:09:16,900 --> 02:09:20,600
Look, Betty... you and l...

1041
02:09:20,700 --> 02:09:25,800
well, we both know that Bruce
couldn't have survived that blast.

1042
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:30,000
But... well, you know...

1043
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:33,100
- What is it?
- Well, you know.

1044
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:36,700
The usual loonies.  Seein' things.

1045
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,800
Only now everything's green.

1046
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:42,500
Right.

1047
02:09:42,600 --> 02:09:45,500
Look, uh...

1048
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:49,200
if by some chance
he did survive...

1049
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:53,900
and he should try to contact you,
try to get in touch,

1050
02:09:54,100 --> 02:09:56,600
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

1051
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:01,600
No... I wouldn't.

1052
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:05,300
But you know as well as I do,
I wouldn't have to.

1053
02:10:05,600 --> 02:10:08,900
I mean, my phones are bugged,
my computer's tapped.

1054
02:10:09,100 --> 02:10:11,200
I'm under surveillance.

1055
02:10:13,500 --> 02:10:16,000
I'll tell you, though,

1056
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:18,200
that if he were alive,

1057
02:10:18,300 --> 02:10:21,400
I'm the last person
I would want him to come to...

1058
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:24,800
because... as much as I miss him,

1059
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:29,000
I... I... loved him.

1060
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:32,100
I, um...

1061
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:35,600
Yeah.

1062
02:10:35,700 --> 02:10:38,000
I'm sorry, Betty.

1063
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:42,900
I am so sorry.

1064
02:10:45,300 --> 02:10:47,400
I know you are.

1065
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,800
Si.

1066
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:40,600
Let's take a walk.

full of pretty bodies</i>

with one thing in mind</i>

everything that you see</i>

1078
02:14:37,500 --> 02:14:40,100
<i>#But now I did it all, I did a little</i>

1079
