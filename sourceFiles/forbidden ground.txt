as your sister?

504
00:51:27,801 --> 00:51:30,441
Sometimes Millie
cries herself to sleep at night,

505
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,760
wondering what he looks like,
what sort of man he'll grow up to be.

506
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:36,482
- But at least...
- I've made my decision, Eve.

507
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:41,010
Well...

508
00:51:44,652 --> 00:51:46,012

You've seen these procedures.

510

You said it yourself.

511
00:52:04,548 --> 00:52:06,308
- No, Grace.
- Eve, please.

512
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:07,790
You have to do this for me.

513
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:11,250
I'm not a doctor. I'm not trained for this.

514

516
00:52:23,025 --> 00:52:24,785
But this isn't about me.

517
00:52:27,488 --> 00:52:30,808
I couldn't bear it if Arthur arrived home
to more pain than he endured out there.

518
00:52:31,117 --> 00:52:34,357
And how much pain would you 'cause him
if you were to die?

519
00:52:41,837 --> 00:52:44,277
Would your fiance still have you

520
00:52:44,548 --> 00:52:46,828
if you were carrying another man's child?

521
00:53:00,106 --> 00:53:01,706
Do you have a picture of him?

522
00:53:03,651 --> 00:53:05,091
Your husband?

523
00:53:22,796 --> 00:53:24,676
I hope he's worth it, Grace.

524
00:53:52,202 --> 00:53:54,242
That's a hell of a thing
you did for me, sir.

525
00:53:54,496 --> 00:53:56,856
All three of us
are getting out of here, Private.

526
00:53:58,167 --> 00:53:59,287
Aye, sir.

527
00:54:05,883 --> 00:54:07,043
Sir, I mean no disrespect,

528
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:09,860
but I can't help thinking
there's something you're not telling me.

529
00:54:09,929 --> 00:54:11,649
And what makes you say that?

530
00:54:13,099 --> 00:54:15,299
Every chance you get
you're looking at your watch.

531
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:22,244
Whatever it is, I can handle it.

532
00:54:24,028 --> 00:54:25,468
Tell him, Arthur.

533
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:38,188
All right, then.

534
00:54:39,711 --> 00:54:41,911
We failed in taking the trenches back.

535
00:54:43,214 --> 00:54:46,614
So at 21:00 hours, the big boys
will be smashing these lines again.

536
00:54:47,344 --> 00:54:48,304
Hard.

537
00:54:49,388 --> 00:54:50,908
21:00?

538
00:54:52,057 --> 00:54:53,577
20 minutes.

539
00:54:56,687 --> 00:54:58,687
We're close, sir. We can make it.

540
00:54:58,981 --> 00:55:01,861
There's a medic's kit caught
in the barbed wire not ten yards away.

541
00:55:02,568 --> 00:55:05,168
If we can patch him up,
we might have a chance.

542
00:55:09,826 --> 00:55:11,506
All right. It's worth a shot.
