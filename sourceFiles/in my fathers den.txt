1
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:29,958
One Day,in a town at the edge of the world.

2
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,875
The tide went out and never returned.

3
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,417
The sea just left without warning.

4
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:47,917
At first people were little more than puzzled.

5
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:51,583
They continued to gossip and fight over the same old things.

6
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:58,167
But soon a silence began to permeate the township.

7
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:09,208
A desert of unbelievable magnitude was beginning to form before their very eyes.

8
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,666
We come together as family and friends

9
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,958
to farewell him and to grieve him.

10
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,000
we think especially of you, his family

11
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:26,083
Andrew, Penny, Jonathan.

12
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:30,916
For the loss of a father, a father-in-law and grandfather.

13
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:37,041
Part of our grief may be regret for things done

14
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,083
or left undone.

15
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,375
words said...

16
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,333
...or words never said.

17
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,208
Yes?

18
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,375
Is Andrew there?

19
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,166
You must be Paul.

20
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,916
Please, come in.

21
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,416
I'm Penny.

22
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,666
- Hi,Penny.
- Andrew's wife.

23
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,916
Ah, they're in here.

24
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,750
Andrew?

25
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,208
Sorry...

26
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,000
My plane was delayed in Hong Kong.

27
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,666
Paul?

28
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,333
Thanks.

29
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,666
- Andrew?
- Thanks.

30
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,666
Jonathan.

31
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:03,083
So, how's London?
Is that where you're based?

32
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:07,125
Actually I'm spending more time in Istanbul these days.

33
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,666
Oh Jesus, fuck it, my balance is completely... fuck.

34
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,333
It's fine, really.

35
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:26,041
You have a nice place. You've done well.

36
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,041
I'll get Penny to make up a bed in a spare room.

37
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,625
- No that's fine. I made reservations from London.
No,really,it's no trouble.

38
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,875
No it's done. Andrew it's done. Thank you.

39
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,583
So...

40
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,291
He's gone.

41
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,250
Yeah.

42
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,666
Paul, wait!

43
00:05:40,124 --> 00:05:41,666
Paul, wait!

44
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,624
Paul, come back!

45
00:05:45,124 --> 00:05:46,916
Paul, don't leave!

46
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,874
Paul!

47
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,499
Andrew!

48
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:27,541
Shit!The lawyers.

49
00:06:28,374 --> 00:06:30,458
Oh fuck!Sorry.

50
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,583
Sorry, I wanted to be there.

51
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,791
Slept in. How did it go?

52
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,624
He left you a third.

53
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,291
Well... you deserve two thirds.

54
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,499
He left me a third as well.

55
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,833
And the rest?

56
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,666
He left it to a charity.

57
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:10,416
Listen, I need to move on this,

58
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:13,833
We need to clear the orchard and the cottage.
I can't wait around, Paul.

59
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,166
I made an appointment for you to see the lawyer on Tuesday.

60
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:16,999
Well, I'll drop by and see him later.

61
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:21,666
You can't just drop by and see

62
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,791
you can't just drop by and see them, Paul.

63
00:07:24,826 --> 00:07:25,833
Right.

64
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,041
Hey you know what?

65
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:31,208
Another job came through. So

66
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,749
I'm leaving, tomorrow.

67
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,416
Well you obviously have more important things.

68
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,458
I'll see you in another 17 years.

69
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:45,499
Come on Andrew, don't be such an old

70
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,291
Come on Andew, don't what?

71
00:07:47,374 --> 00:07:49,499
How long have you been here, Paul? Two days?

72
00:07:49,624 --> 00:07:52,124
Forget the fact that this all just leaves me and

73
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,208
you're just like when mum died.

74
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:54,916
Oh leave mum the fuck out of it, Andrew.

75
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,999
At least have the decency to do that.

76
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,041
Decency?

77
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,374
You think you're the one being decent?

78
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:04,333
Swanning in here like some bloody film star with your accent?

79
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,416
You know nothing about me, Andrew.

80
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:15,083
Listen, he would have wanted you to have these.

81
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,666
I almost forgot.

82
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,916
They handed me this at the council meeting.

83
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,999
You dropped it at the pub the afternoon of the service.

84
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,624
It could be useful getting home.

85
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,166
You didn't have to lie to me, Paul.

86
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:39,624
We weren't expecting you in the first place.

87
00:13:20,082 --> 00:13:22,249
That's good wine you're spilling.

88
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:26,874
How did you find this place?

89
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:27,915
I heard music.

90
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,665
Mom doesn't know about this place?

91
00:13:33,749 --> 00:13:35,749
No, she doesn't.

92
00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:44,707
It's OK.

93
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:46,665
You can stay.

94
00:14:19,665 --> 00:14:21,415
One day in a town at the edge of the world.

95
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,540
The tide went out and never returned.

96
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,665
When do you think you'll learn?

97
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,707
As soon as we get these blood samples back and the swabs, a couple of days.

98
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:43,999
I've extended my trip. I'll sort the house out.

99
00:14:53,332 --> 00:14:54,749
Paul

100
00:14:56,499 --> 00:14:57,915
Thanks.

101
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,165
Green tea.

102
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,207
What's he doing down there?

103
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:21,749
There's been an outbreak of some virus. I'm praying they're okay.

104
00:15:25,915 --> 00:15:27,415
He cares about you, Paul.

105
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,499
He never told Jonathan about me.

106
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:34,915
We each have our own way of dealing with things.

107
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:41,790
I can't believe how much you look like mum.

108
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,623
Who is she?

109
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,832
That's hope.

110
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:33,332
Is she crying?

111
00:16:34,248 --> 00:16:36,040
She's thinking.

112
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,123
About what?

113
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:45,498
Many things.

114
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:11,998
Turin Brakes "Full Of Stars"

115
00:17:27,123 --> 00:17:28,665
Jesus!

116
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,915
What are you doing here?

117
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:36,415
It's just a place that I found that no one else comes to, I just...

118
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,123
Did he let you come here?

119
00:17:40,332 --> 00:17:41,165
No.

120
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,498
No one knows that I come here.

121
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,248
I should probably go.

122
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:49,290
Yeah, I think you should.

123
00:17:50,748 --> 00:17:53,748
I'll give you a couple of minutes to get your shit together and get out.

124
00:19:31,706 --> 00:19:33,206
Paulie!

125
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:36,748
- Paulie Prior?
- Hey, Winnie.

126
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:36,783
Look who it is

127
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:42,748
How are you doing?

128
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,498
I was looking for you at the service and I thought

129
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,081
I bet the little bugger is here somewhere. And I dont' even recognize him.

130
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:52,456
Ah no I had some complications.

131
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,623
Oh that's a shame.
Hey you remember Pat.

132
00:19:56,831 --> 00:19:59,456
Pat, look, look who it is. It's Paulie

133
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:01,915
Miss Seager!

134
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:03,915
Well, well...

135
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:06,665
Hey, Paul.

136
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,748
I had no idea you were still here.

137
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:11,373
What? you thought I'd dropped off the face of the earth?

138
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,331
And he even has the fancy bloomin plummy accent.

139
00:20:25,831 --> 00:20:27,456
War zones.

140
00:20:27,998 --> 00:20:29,915
From the genocide in Ruwanda

141
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:32,831
to the ceaseless fighting in the Middle East

142
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:35,540
and the horrors of the Bosnian conflict.

143
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,206
War zones have been both home and work

144
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:41,206
for the last decade to the man you are about to meet.

145
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,123
A man whose dedication and courage

146
00:20:43,248 --> 00:20:46,498
has gained him an international reputation of the highest merit.

147
00:20:47,123 --> 00:20:49,415
Not to mention

148
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,831
the numerous awards he has received for both his articles and photographs,

149
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,581
and that he is an old dear student of mine

150
00:20:55,831 --> 00:20:58,248
who I taught in these very buildings.

151
00:20:58,998 --> 00:21:01,248
I present to you Paul Prior.

152
00:21:12,456 --> 00:21:14,040
Thank you.

153
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:17,165
That was a very generous introduction, Miss Seagar.

154
00:21:18,456 --> 00:21:20,915
Yeah, my school reports were never that good.

155
00:21:24,123 --> 00:21:26,498
The truth is that

156
00:21:26,956 --> 00:21:29,040
I've been called many things,

157
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:32,165
many worse things since I last stepped foot in this building

158
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:36,748
vulture, parasite,leech

159
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,415
And it's amazing how insults in most languages sound pretty much the same.

160
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,040
I was once

161
00:21:49,831 --> 00:21:54,456
held captive for three days and publicly urinated on.

162
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:58,706
I don't really know what to say,

163
00:21:58,915 --> 00:22:02,290
but I'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have.

164
00:22:46,914 --> 00:22:49,039
He was a finalist for the Pulitzer

165
00:22:50,248 --> 00:22:52,623
Pulitzer? What the hell is that?

166
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:54,873
It's a huge prize.

167
00:22:55,414 --> 00:22:58,081
He had a one in three chance of winning it as well.

168
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,498
How do you know this shit?

169
00:23:06,623 --> 00:23:07,748
I read an interview.

170
00:23:07,998 --> 00:23:10,081
Sounds like a lone wolf.

171
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:14,956
That reminds me, I'm thinking of getting a tattoo.

172
00:23:15,081 --> 00:23:17,206
A little unicorn, right here.

173
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:19,831
Why?

174
00:23:19,956 --> 00:23:21,706
Steve has exactly the same one?

175
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:23,789
No I just think it would be cool.

176
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:30,414
So anyway.

177
00:23:32,123 --> 00:23:34,414
How'd it go with Jake?

178
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:36,206
Piss off.

179
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,248
Tell me!

180
00:23:40,623 --> 00:23:41,998
Well...

181
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:45,039
first of all we had a moonlight stroll down the beach

182
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:47,581
and a candle light dinner

183
00:23:47,664 --> 00:23:50,498
and then he told me what beautiful eyes I had.

184
00:23:50,748 --> 00:23:51,289
Really?

185
00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:53,039
No, you dyke.

186
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:56,664
He only got drinks to go on the Big Day Out.

187
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,289
You know he was like

188
00:23:59,456 --> 00:24:02,539
Yo man. Yo bitch.

189
00:24:04,998 --> 00:24:07,581
And I think it should be quite so obvious.

190
00:24:10,664 --> 00:24:13,289
I was reading the local rag today.

191
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,164
Front page.

192
00:24:21,498 --> 00:24:23,248
Oh God.

193
00:24:23,998 --> 00:24:26,498
I'd forgotten how quiet is, really.

194
00:24:27,623 --> 00:24:30,998
I've had this bloody ringing in my ears ever since I got here.

195
00:24:32,414 --> 00:24:34,623
Maybe the change here will do you good.

196
00:24:35,414 --> 00:24:38,331
Like I said, if you ever get bored photographing war.

197
00:24:43,498 --> 00:24:45,623
You weren't being serious, were you?

198
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:49,081
I'm three staff down, Paul.

199
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:51,998
I know it might sound desperate, but

200
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:55,331
Pat, I'd be hopeless, I've never taught in my life. Come on.

201
00:24:55,456 --> 00:24:58,789
You went out and made something of yourself. What can beat that?

202
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:03,748
Half these kids don't even know what's on the other side of those hills.

203
00:25:27,956 --> 00:25:29,373
Paul!

204
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:47,623
Paul gave Jonathan this.

205
00:25:48,456 --> 00:25:50,539
It's got a good zoom lens.

206
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:55,748
It's much, much too kind.

207
00:25:56,164 --> 00:25:56,789
No, it's fine.

208
00:25:56,914 --> 00:25:58,706
Honestly, I'm using digital these days.

209
00:25:58,831 --> 00:26:01,664
If you're going to be a serious photographer, you need a good zoom lens.

210
00:26:08,206 --> 00:26:09,914
See you tomorrow then.

211
00:26:18,122 --> 00:26:19,831
Goodnight. Paul.

212
00:26:19,914 --> 00:26:21,164
Goodnight.

213
00:26:29,164 --> 00:26:31,789
Jonathan said he gave a talk at the school.

214
00:26:33,164 --> 00:26:35,539
Apparently the kids really liked him.

215
00:26:37,956 --> 00:26:39,456
Good.

216
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:54,872
Can I fuck you now?

217
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,747
God! You've got a way with words!

218
00:27:59,831 --> 00:28:01,872
Sorry, what do you want to do then?

219
00:28:07,164 --> 00:28:08,456
What you all doing man?

220
00:28:08,622 --> 00:28:09,914
Just playing.

221
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:17,831
Just play carefully.

222
00:28:19,956 --> 00:28:22,706
Shit! Fuck you!

223
00:28:25,122 --> 00:28:27,331
You were meant to stay still.

224
00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:01,122
You look well.

225
00:29:01,872 --> 00:29:04,164
Well, used more like it.

226
00:29:05,247 --> 00:29:06,581
It's different.

227
00:29:06,706 --> 00:29:08,456
You have an accent. So English.

228
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:09,497
You think?

229
00:29:10,497 --> 00:29:12,414
Well, it was inevitable.

230
00:29:12,497 --> 00:29:14,456
Sick of being called an Australian.

231
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:15,497
Fair enough.

232
00:29:16,581 --> 00:29:17,956
Help yourself.

233
00:29:18,164 --> 00:29:18,997
Oh no, I quit.

234
00:29:22,581 --> 00:29:23,206
Kids?

235
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:25,289
Two.

236
00:29:25,372 --> 00:29:26,997
One of each.

237
00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:29,039
Remember Ben?

238
00:29:29,331 --> 00:29:30,497
Ben Steimer.

239
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:33,122
Yeah.

240
00:29:33,997 --> 00:29:36,872
We got together about 18 months after you left.

241
00:29:36,997 --> 00:29:39,872
He died when Elvis was five.

242
00:29:39,956 --> 00:29:41,456
Motobike.

243
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:42,497
I'm sorry.

244
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:48,205
I was pregnant with Sam at the time.

245
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:52,455
So I had the kids to think about and decided to keep the business running.

246
00:29:52,705 --> 00:29:54,205
What was that?

247
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,830
Butchery.

248
00:29:55,914 --> 00:29:58,330
Shortest butcher in New Zealand.

249
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,372
Really?

250
00:30:03,455 --> 00:30:05,372
Yeah well, I'm a ninja with a boning knife.

251
00:30:05,455 --> 00:30:07,580
No surprises there.

252
00:30:11,747 --> 00:30:14,455
I see your brother from time to time.

253
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,539
Yeah, he's up to his neck in ostriches.

254
00:30:20,955 --> 00:30:23,080
Is he still married? I never see his wife.

255
00:30:23,205 --> 00:30:26,497
No, yeah, I don't think she goes out much

256
00:30:43,164 --> 00:30:46,205
How many times have I told you about leaving the gate to the pen open?

257
00:31:06,455 --> 00:31:09,039
If you think you're going to see this again you're mistaken.

258
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:16,372
You disgust me.

259
00:31:19,914 --> 00:31:21,580
Who the hell is this guy?

260
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:24,330
Just an old school friend. It's no big deal.

261
00:31:24,664 --> 00:31:25,372
No big deal?

262
00:31:25,497 --> 00:31:27,372
Where's my jacket?

263
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:29,914
Celia, It's rubbish night.

264
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,789
And please tie the bags. I don't want dogs getting into them. Bye, bye.

265
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,080
Hey, we'll be waiting.

266
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,247
Need a hand with that?

267
00:31:44,497 --> 00:31:46,455
Done your homework?

268
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,997
Will you please take your foot away?

269
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:54,289
What? Just to see if you've done your homework.

270
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,164
Just asking.

271
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:06,039
I'm sure we used to be able to do this.

272
00:32:26,872 --> 00:32:28,539
Did you think of me?

273
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,289
I was terrified of seeing you.

274
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,497
You remember those poems and stories you used to write?

275
00:32:52,914 --> 00:32:55,872
I was going to put music to them, release an album.

276
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:58,580
What were we were going to call ourselves?

277
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,455
What was it? Was it "silly bastards"?

278
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,414
"Stupid Buggers"

279
00:33:10,705 --> 00:33:13,122
"Sick Motherfuckers", "Sick Fuckers", wasn't it?

280
00:33:15,122 --> 00:33:17,372
"Sick Puppy", actually.

281
00:33:20,622 --> 00:33:22,705
Live at the Hammersmith.

282
00:33:23,913 --> 00:33:28,622
Yeah, see that's me. Eight years behind what was going on. But, you know,

283
00:33:29,872 --> 00:33:33,205
still thinking I had created it all for myself.

284
00:35:27,705 --> 00:35:29,080
Hi.

285
00:35:29,288 --> 00:35:33,455
I've got an assignment where I have to interview an important local community member.

286
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:39,372
And it was a choice between you and Mr Aiken who set up the irrigation main.

287
00:35:39,663 --> 00:35:42,247
I was just wondering if I could interview you?

288
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,538
Can I come in?

289
00:36:09,413 --> 00:36:11,163
Is there real coffee?

290
00:36:14,497 --> 00:36:16,372
Sure. How do you have it?

291
00:36:17,497 --> 00:36:19,622
Macchito, thanks.

292
00:36:29,455 --> 00:36:31,663
I'm Celia by the way.

293
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,163
I gather you do have some questions.

294
00:36:51,246 --> 00:36:52,913
Ah Yes. Ah Yeah.

295
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:58,163
So, how did you get to do what you do?

296
00:36:59,413 --> 00:37:01,705
I was working for a paper in London on local articles,

297
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:03,871
and they needed somebody to go to Bosnia.

298
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:06,996
That right, yeah. You were working as a typesetter in Wellington,

299
00:37:07,663 --> 00:37:09,246
and you studied journalism in London,

300
00:37:09,371 --> 00:37:12,080
and found your break as a feature article writer,

301
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:14,455
and then a field journalist for Reuters.

302
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,580
And for the past three and a half years you've been solidly freelance living

303
00:37:17,705 --> 00:37:20,080
between London, Istanbul and Paris.

304
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,163
Well done. Yes. That's it.

305
00:37:22,621 --> 00:37:24,913
You've really done your homework.

306
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:29,955
People must worry about you a lot doing this kind of work.

307
00:37:30,038 --> 00:37:31,413
Your wife? Children?

308
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:33,496
No, not married.

309
00:37:35,413 --> 00:37:37,288
Single? Yes.

310
00:37:38,788 --> 00:37:40,830
What's it like going to war? Just to watch?

311
00:37:40,955 --> 00:37:43,871
I'm not there to watch. I'm there to record.

312
00:37:43,996 --> 00:37:47,621
Is that how you got those scars?

313
00:37:51,038 --> 00:37:54,455
I fell off my bike when I was 12 coming down a gravel track.

314
00:37:54,996 --> 00:37:56,996
No other scars?

315
00:38:01,538 --> 00:38:03,496
Are you going to drink your macchito?

316
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:15,038
What's the hardest thing you have to deal with?

317
00:38:15,163 --> 00:38:17,538
Jesus. Are these going to get any easier?

318
00:38:19,496 --> 00:38:22,996
I don't know, finding a loo when you need one,which always seems to be pretty fucking impossible.

319
00:38:35,705 --> 00:38:38,538
Why don't you celebrate your birthday on Christmas?

320
00:38:41,246 --> 00:38:43,496
Now tell me, which article did you read that one in?

321
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:46,413
It was your birthday when you took that photo of that girl.

322
00:38:46,496 --> 00:38:47,830
The one you won the Pulitzer for.

323
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,913
I was shortlisted.

324
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:53,080
I read that when you got nominated

325
00:38:54,413 --> 00:38:56,371
you withdrew the entry.

326
00:38:56,496 --> 00:38:57,996
Long story.

327
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,871
I've got a 120 minute tape.

328
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,163
I was in Grozny

329
00:39:20,871 --> 00:39:24,371
I heard about an offensive that was being mounted against the Russians.

330
00:39:25,746 --> 00:39:27,913
I was warned by some friends not to write about it

331
00:39:28,038 --> 00:39:30,496
in case the Russians caught whiff about what was going to happen.

332
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:31,371
So what did you do?

333
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:32,830
Wrote the article.

334
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,288
Then I declined sending it through to Reuters.

335
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,288
They found out anyway.

336
00:39:39,413 --> 00:39:43,246
And they retaliated by massacring over 100 civilians in the village outside the city.

337
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:48,538
.And I'd been out all night drinking with people who were killed a few hours later.

338
00:39:48,663 --> 00:39:50,788
The girl in the photo was the

339
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:53,455
was the only survivor.

340
00:39:53,746 --> 00:39:54,830
Did you know her?

341
00:39:55,288 --> 00:39:55,871
No.

342
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,830
Was there anyone else around?

343
00:40:00,163 --> 00:40:01,371
Not at the time, no.

344
00:40:01,746 --> 00:40:02,538
Just you?

345
00:40:02,788 --> 00:40:03,788
Just me.

346
00:40:06,038 --> 00:40:08,080
So then what?

347
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:14,454
I think your batteries are running flat.

348
00:40:24,246 --> 00:40:25,788
Are you...

349
00:40:26,204 --> 00:40:28,496
Are you Ben Steimer's daughter?

350
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:30,454
Did you know him?

351
00:40:31,038 --> 00:40:32,538
Yeah, we went to school together.

352
00:40:38,704 --> 00:40:39,871
It's a photo of a baby.

353
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:40,913
Whose?

354
00:40:41,454 --> 00:40:42,954
I don't know. Do I need to?

355
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:44,496
Yeah, look at the bracelet.

356
00:40:49,288 --> 00:40:52,788
No, look! "Celia, 27/2/87".

357
00:40:53,038 --> 00:40:55,704
That's roughly 8 months after I left.

358
00:41:04,246 --> 00:41:05,496
I sent that photo nearly 16 years ago.

359
00:41:05,788 --> 00:41:07,079
Why did you send it?

360
00:41:12,413 --> 00:41:14,371
Why did you send it, Jax?

361
00:41:18,454 --> 00:41:20,413
You want an explanation?

362
00:41:24,246 --> 00:41:26,829
Do you know what's it like to be invisible, Paul?

363
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:30,538
Even just a postcard.

364
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:33,121
A phone call.

365
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:38,746
Hi Sid, up there next to the porkers.

366
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:44,996
Patti Smith "Free Money"

367
00:41:54,288 --> 00:41:56,204
It's in the past. OK?

368
00:41:56,788 --> 00:41:58,871
Just leave it.

369
00:42:12,954 --> 00:42:14,579
Will you be needing a copy of that?

370
00:42:15,038 --> 00:42:16,163
No, thank you.

371
00:43:17,371 --> 00:43:20,246
Oh my god. I think I need rescuing from these TV blokes.

372
00:43:21,246 --> 00:43:23,079
Is it a good book, is it?

373
00:43:23,454 --> 00:43:26,246
"The Cloud of Unknowing", Sounds mysterious.

374
00:43:27,413 --> 00:43:29,038
Where are you from?

375
00:43:29,288 --> 00:43:31,288
Where am I from?

376
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:34,579
A long way from here.

377
00:43:34,788 --> 00:43:37,121
Me too. Mind if I join you?

378
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:42,787
Want a drink?

379
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:43,829
I'd love one.

380
00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:08,496
Kiss me.

381
00:45:17,704 --> 00:45:18,996
Am I warm?

382
00:45:24,162 --> 00:45:25,662
Getting closer.

383
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:26,704
Warmer?

384
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:27,871
Getting warmer.

385
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,121
Warmer?

386
00:45:29,996 --> 00:45:31,412
Warmer, in springtime.

387
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:32,454
Here!

388
00:45:57,704 --> 00:46:00,204
Alone we are born

389
00:46:00,496 --> 00:46:02,329
And die alone

390
00:46:03,287 --> 00:46:07,371
Yet see the red-gold cirrus
Over snow mountain shine

391
00:46:08,537 --> 00:46:10,579
Upon the upland road

392
00:46:10,704 --> 00:46:12,912
Ride easy, stranger

393
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:16,037
Surrender to the sky, your heart of anger

394
00:46:20,621 --> 00:46:23,121
Don't be frightened of possibilities, son.

395
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:25,746
She's a wonderful mistress.

396
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:10,537
It's ok.

397
00:47:10,787 --> 00:47:12,829
It's ok.

398
00:47:22,662 --> 00:47:24,370
It's ok.

399
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,662
It's ok.

400
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,620
Go back to sleep.

401
00:48:18,537 --> 00:48:21,454
I'm helping out for a couple of weeks.

402
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:24,079
And I'm new at this, so be patient with me.

403
00:48:26,412 --> 00:48:29,037
Who knows how many words there are in the English language?

404
00:48:29,162 --> 00:48:30,120
10 thousand.

405
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:31,162
10 thousand.

406
00:48:34,037 --> 00:48:37,412
Dictionary. There's actually over 750,000 words.

407
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:40,954
And I was a - I thought maybe you could all choose a word.

408
00:48:41,329 --> 00:48:44,120
Any word, doesn't matter what. Preferably something that means something to you.

409
00:48:44,204 --> 00:48:46,704
And compose something on this word.

410
00:48:47,162 --> 00:48:50,954
Anything. It could be just a static image of you if you think that's easier.

411
00:48:52,412 --> 00:48:54,912
Just so I get an idea of who you all are.

412
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:57,537
And what the F- I've gotten myself into.

413
00:50:08,745 --> 00:50:10,454
Hope.

414
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:13,620
Her mind is a graveyard. Her heart is an island.

415
00:50:16,829 --> 00:50:20,037
She and I are not good friends but I've known her all my life.

416
00:50:24,912 --> 00:50:27,787
She sits in my belly hollow and distant.

417
00:50:28,204 --> 00:50:31,829
And her whispered words of encouragement will never comfort me.

418
00:50:33,912 --> 00:50:35,370
Mom?

419
00:50:44,037 --> 00:50:47,245
I'm on to her tricks. Her false promises.

420
00:50:48,203 --> 00:50:51,745
"Go away", I tell her.
"I'm busy today. " I've got things to do. "

421
00:50:54,703 --> 00:50:57,578
This acquaintance never knows when to leave.

422
00:50:58,828 --> 00:51:02,370
It's not a question of why she befriended me in the first place.

423
00:51:04,328 --> 00:51:07,578
It's more a question of why I choose to let her stay.

424
00:51:33,953 --> 00:51:37,162
Tea bag! Tea bag!

425
00:51:37,453 --> 00:51:40,453
Tea bag!

426
00:51:43,745 --> 00:51:46,328
Tea bag!

427
00:51:49,995 --> 00:51:53,370
- Tea bag!
- Leave her alone, you fuckin' animal!

428
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,412
Tea bag! Tea bag!

429
00:53:45,203 --> 00:53:47,037
Your knee's bleeding.

430
00:53:47,162 --> 00:53:48,995
I know. I fell.

431
00:53:58,953 --> 00:54:00,912
Come on. Let's take a look at it, then.

432
00:54:34,078 --> 00:54:35,495
Weeks passed

433
00:54:35,578 --> 00:54:38,411
and there was still no sign of the ocean.

434
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,745
The people grew worried.

435
00:54:43,828 --> 00:54:47,036
It was decided to send a small group to search for it

436
00:54:47,203 --> 00:54:49,661
in the hope of bringing it back.

437
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,328
All right attention please.

438
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:04,245
I would appreciate it if everyone listened.

439
00:55:04,661 --> 00:55:06,911
That includes you, Mr Brook.

440
00:55:10,036 --> 00:55:12,620
Look. Have any of you seen Celia since yesterday?

441
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:21,745
No? Well, if she gets in touch with any of you,

442
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:23,828
you know where to find me, okay?

443
00:55:24,078 --> 00:55:25,578
Thanks.

444
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:31,036
All right. Settle down. We've all seen a police officer before.

445
00:55:40,661 --> 00:55:43,995
Paul? Look, Just wondering. Can I have a word for a second?

446
00:55:44,453 --> 00:55:45,453
I'm already late for a class.

447
00:55:45,578 --> 00:55:46,495
It won't take long.

448
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:49,536
Back to class.

449
00:55:56,661 --> 00:55:57,995
Paul?

450
00:55:58,078 --> 00:56:00,786
Hey, Pat, It's fine. I'm just helping out with something.

451
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:02,578
Thanks, Pat.

452
00:56:07,203 --> 00:56:09,828
Hey, did you see Celia on the weekend?

453
00:56:10,786 --> 00:56:12,370
No.

454
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:15,370
She used to visit though, right.

455
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:20,286
Yeah.

456
00:56:22,328 --> 00:56:25,036
She came by sometimes to borrow books.

457
00:56:16,578 --> 00:56:19,161
She liked to drop by most Sundays I guess, yeah.

458
00:56:34,911 --> 00:56:37,161
Liked?
Likes.

459
00:56:37,953 --> 00:56:40,078
I said likes, I think.

460
00:56:40,661 --> 00:56:43,578
Ah see cause I think I know what Celia likes.

461
00:56:43,703 --> 00:56:46,828
I mean I've known her since she was a little kid. She's my daughter's best friend.

462
00:56:48,495 --> 00:56:52,203
I also know that you sent her an e-mail on the weekend asking her to come by and visit.

463
00:56:52,828 --> 00:56:55,703
She wasn't too happy about that from what I understand.

464
00:56:56,995 --> 00:56:58,995
You see I know this, Paul

465
00:56:59,161 --> 00:57:01,786
because Miso agreed to drop her off.

466
00:57:02,036 --> 00:57:04,661
Actually she did drop by briefly.

467
00:57:09,786 --> 00:57:11,911
It's nice out there at the orchard.

468
00:57:12,036 --> 00:57:14,245
Quiet. Private.

469
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,078
So why did you stay on?

470
00:57:21,953 --> 00:57:24,078
Favour for a friend.

471
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,245
How long did you guys go out for?

472
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:29,578
What?

473
00:57:29,745 --> 00:57:30,078
om

474
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:34,161
Oh, she mentioned me.

475
00:57:34,328 --> 00:57:35,703
When did you break up?

476
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,078
God, seventeen.

477
00:57:40,286 --> 00:57:40,911
Keep your leg still.

478
00:57:49,328 --> 00:57:52,286
Listen, what you wrote the other day, I thought it was

479
00:57:54,994 --> 00:57:56,911
well considered.

480
00:57:57,703 --> 00:58:00,369
Well considered.
Intriguing.

481
00:58:11,911 --> 00:58:13,994
I like what you've done here.

482
00:58:14,994 --> 00:58:17,286
Where did all these books come from?

483
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:20,078
He never told me.

484
00:58:20,203 --> 00:58:22,078
Wanted to keep it a mystery, I suppose.

485
00:58:22,244 --> 00:58:24,828
Father's have got a lot to answer for, huh?

486
00:58:49,911 --> 00:58:51,619
Hey beautiful.

487
00:58:53,286 --> 00:58:55,161
Sorry I'm late.

488
00:59:15,953 --> 00:59:17,869
She can't have gone far.

489
00:59:25,411 --> 00:59:28,869
Me and some mates are going to take a look around Lawrence later.

490
00:59:30,828 --> 00:59:32,619
Can you bring those?

491
00:59:34,578 --> 00:59:36,078
Sure.

492
00:59:38,369 --> 00:59:41,244
I asked for an essay about the pros and cons of immigration, Jake

493
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:43,494
not the best places to surf.

494
00:59:43,661 --> 00:59:46,244
Louise, Tonga has a king, not a president.

495
00:59:47,578 --> 00:59:50,619
I think you'll find there's more to life in Hong Kong than dance clubs, Miso.

496
00:59:50,744 --> 00:59:53,578
What? Like secret book clubs?

497
01:00:00,786 --> 01:00:02,411
Paul!

498
01:00:06,786 --> 01:00:08,744
Sergeant O'Neil's back.

499
01:00:08,911 --> 01:00:11,244
He's waiting for you in the common room.

500
01:00:06,661 --> 01:00:08,953
You had nice handwriting as a kid.

501
01:00:26,369 --> 01:00:28,661
Is this one of the books she borrowed?

502
01:00:30,161 --> 01:00:31,994
I didn't

503
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,828
I didn't keep a record, to tell you the truth. I didn't.

504
01:00:35,994 --> 01:00:38,494
What? Other things on your mind, did you?

505
01:00:40,786 --> 01:00:44,328
We found this on the side of the road, bet it came from your place.

506
01:00:45,411 --> 01:00:48,078
Just want to know how it got there, that's all.

507
01:00:51,453 --> 01:00:53,744
Did she ever talk to you about leaving?

508
01:00:54,369 --> 01:00:57,453
Name a teenager around here who doesn't.

509
01:00:58,078 --> 01:01:00,161
I know a few actually.

510
01:01:20,786 --> 01:01:23,327
Stop.

511
01:01:41,536 --> 01:01:43,619
OK. You can open your eyes.

512
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,369
Happy Birthday.

513
01:01:56,744 --> 01:01:58,452
Who is this anyway?

514
01:01:58,827 --> 01:02:00,577
Kiri Te Kanawa. You chose it.

515
01:02:00,911 --> 01:02:01,619
Who's she?

516
01:02:01,994 --> 01:02:03,369
Who's she?

517
01:02:03,536 --> 01:02:07,452
There are people in this country who would shoot you for asking that question.

518
01:02:07,827 --> 01:02:10,994
There are people in this country who would shoot you for listening to it.

519
01:02:16,577 --> 01:02:18,744
So what's she singing about?

520
01:02:20,411 --> 01:02:22,202
Love.

521
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:29,244
What do you normally do on a Saturday night?

522
01:02:29,327 --> 01:02:32,327
Who do you hang out with when you're not having picnics with me?

523
01:02:32,452 --> 01:02:33,911
What do you do, go to parties or what?

524
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:35,661
If you can call them that.

525
01:02:35,744 --> 01:02:39,577
Why? Do you wanna come along?
You actually might get to see them tea bagging.

526
01:02:39,786 --> 01:02:41,786
Tea bagging? What's that?

527
01:02:43,411 --> 01:02:46,619
Well, That's when guys get a girl completely comatose

528
01:02:46,744 --> 01:02:51,744
and then they take turns in lowering their testicles into her eye sockets and film it.

529
01:02:52,577 --> 01:02:55,286
And if they're really kind they send a copy to a paranoid friend.

530
01:02:56,494 --> 01:02:59,744
First class is seminal? It's not funny.

531
01:03:02,744 --> 01:03:04,452
I don't know what we're talking about.

532
01:03:04,827 --> 01:03:05,494
Oh god.

533
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:13,536
Well I hope you keep your distance from those kind of guys is what I'm saying.

534
01:03:17,619 --> 01:03:20,369
So, tell me about you and mum, back in the dark ages.

535
01:03:20,494 --> 01:03:22,786
It wasn't that long ago.

536
01:03:26,744 --> 01:03:32,161
Patti Smith "Horses"

537
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:51,744
My mom wanted to sing like this?

538
01:03:52,869 --> 01:03:55,494
Your mother wanted to be Patti Smith.

539
01:04:47,535 --> 01:04:49,869
Come with me. Come on.

540
01:04:50,744 --> 01:04:52,410
I'll show you something.

541
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,160
Where did this place come from?

542
01:05:13,494 --> 01:05:15,827
No one knows about it except me and my dad.

543
01:05:16,619 --> 01:05:18,369
So what are you doing here?

544
01:05:19,744 --> 01:05:20,452
Write.

545
01:05:21,494 --> 01:05:22,994
Think.

546
01:05:26,327 --> 01:05:28,160
Mystery boy.

547
01:05:28,369 --> 01:05:30,327
So many secrets.

548
01:05:36,869 --> 01:05:38,577
What are you doing?

549
01:05:40,452 --> 01:05:42,744
Giving you something to write about, moron.

550
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:49,035
Mom the rock star.

551
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:51,702
It's hard to believe she even had a dream.

552
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,952
Do you want to know what my dream is?

553
01:05:57,327 --> 01:05:57,994
Yeah.

554
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,535
I'm sitting in a cafe in Spain.

555
01:06:08,202 --> 01:06:12,702
And don't know a single person there. And I can't understand a single word that anyone's saying.

556
01:06:14,827 --> 01:06:17,035
I've got a glass of wine

557
01:06:18,952 --> 01:06:21,077
and I can see the sea.

558
01:06:27,869 --> 01:06:28,702
Don't worry.

559
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:30,369
No, go on. And?

560
01:06:34,744 --> 01:06:36,535
I'm just writing.

561
01:06:39,369 --> 01:06:40,869
And yeah.

562
01:06:43,452 --> 01:06:46,827
And you know it doesn't matter if no one ever reads what I'm writing

563
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:50,035
I don't want to be famous.

564
01:06:50,785 --> 01:06:52,785
I just, I just want to be there.

565
01:07:00,744 --> 01:07:04,785
Anyway, I'd rather be a no one somewhere than someone nowhere.

566
01:07:07,077 --> 01:07:09,244
I've already packed my suitcase.

567
01:07:10,702 --> 01:07:11,910
I'm not joking.

568
01:07:12,369 --> 01:07:13,577
I'm not laughing at you.

569
01:07:15,535 --> 01:07:18,119
I had a similar dream once.

570
01:07:18,369 --> 01:07:19,952
Really?

571
01:07:21,494 --> 01:07:23,077
Tell me.

572
01:07:27,744 --> 01:07:31,410
Sometimes I'd see... faces.

573
01:07:35,035 --> 01:07:38,702
At night before I fell asleep, people I never met.

574
01:07:41,285 --> 01:07:42,869
And I'd wonder who they were.

575
01:07:44,545 --> 01:07:47,044
Where they might live, what they did.

576
01:07:48,378 --> 01:07:49,961
and it was strange

577
01:07:50,253 --> 01:07:53,419
because it was like they knew I was thinking about them.

578
01:07:55,836 --> 01:07:58,503
Why did you become a war journalist?

579
01:08:01,586 --> 01:08:04,711
Who you set out to be is not always who you become.

580
01:08:04,836 --> 01:08:07,419
You know, Things happen. Plans change.

581
01:08:13,461 --> 01:08:15,336
I see them too.

582
01:08:17,086 --> 01:08:18,961
Faces.

583
01:08:23,711 --> 01:08:25,378
I wanted to give you something.

584
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:36,253
Yeah, right.

585
01:08:36,586 --> 01:08:39,003
I just, I think you should enter.

586
01:09:13,378 --> 01:09:15,586
You never talk about your mum.

587
01:09:15,753 --> 01:09:17,544
My mum? She's very religious.

588
01:09:17,794 --> 01:09:21,294
She had these little sermons about the beauty God hides away in quiet corners.

589
01:09:21,628 --> 01:09:24,294
Is that what your dad was hiding from in here?

590
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:26,544
No, they

591
01:09:27,003 --> 01:09:29,503
I think she was just quiet, you know.

592
01:09:30,586 --> 01:09:32,753
My dad and her were very different.

593
01:09:32,836 --> 01:09:35,544
My dad didn't believe in anything. He's an atheist.

594
01:09:35,711 --> 01:09:38,044
My brother and her were very close.

595
01:09:39,253 --> 01:09:41,628
I heard she had an accident.

596
01:09:42,586 --> 01:09:44,378
Yeah she did.

597
01:09:44,919 --> 01:09:48,128
She was diagnosed as bi-polar, manic depression.

598
01:09:49,253 --> 01:09:52,794
Doctors prescribed lithium but she stopped taking it, I think.

599
01:09:53,878 --> 01:09:55,836
What happened?

600
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:01,836
She was standing in the river

601
01:10:03,461 --> 01:10:06,753
at the back of the property and she pointed up to this hawk in the sky.

602
01:10:06,919 --> 01:10:09,294
And then when I looked back she was gone.

603
01:10:09,419 --> 01:10:11,961
Found the body two days later, I think

604
01:10:17,586 --> 01:10:20,128
Is that why you push people away?

605
01:10:26,044 --> 01:10:29,586
I do as I fuckin' please Celia. You know I hate to spoil your illusions.

606
01:10:31,336 --> 01:10:34,253
But the world out there isn't a bed of roses waiting to be picked

607
01:10:35,169 --> 01:10:38,544
or whatever it was you said, a glass of chardonnay in a fuckin' tapas bar.

608
01:10:39,961 --> 01:10:40,794
You understand?

609
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:42,669
It wasn't an insult.

610
01:10:48,919 --> 01:10:50,628
Sorry.

611
01:10:55,211 --> 01:10:56,711
OK.

612
01:11:09,878 --> 01:11:11,586
Hey, Jax.

613
01:11:12,503 --> 01:11:13,961
Hi

614
01:11:14,794 --> 01:11:16,627
I saw the smoke and I didn't want to disturb you

615
01:11:16,877 --> 01:11:18,711
but I remembered it was your birthday and so I

616
01:11:33,711 --> 01:11:35,419
Get in the car

617
01:11:36,794 --> 01:11:37,669
No.

618
01:11:37,836 --> 01:11:39,211
Celia, I'm sick of this.

619
01:11:39,336 --> 01:11:42,377
I said get in the car. I said get in the car

620
01:11:44,919 --> 01:11:47,461
You have no right to be here. Night, Paul.

621
01:11:55,669 --> 01:11:58,586
You have the audacity to bring here and give her alcohol?

622
01:11:58,669 --> 01:12:01,252
Jax, it's not what you think.

623
01:12:06,002 --> 01:12:08,711
You even presume to know what I think?

624
01:12:23,002 --> 01:12:24,461
Shit!

625
01:12:26,252 --> 01:12:27,002
Excuse me.

626
01:12:28,336 --> 01:12:32,502
I need a notebook. I know it's here somewhere.

627
01:12:35,961 --> 01:12:36,586
Sorry, dad.

628
01:12:37,002 --> 01:12:38,669
There's nothing to be sorry for

629
01:12:39,336 --> 01:12:41,336
as long as you're being cautious.

630
01:12:41,419 --> 01:12:43,044
Yeah of course.

631
01:12:44,877 --> 01:12:46,544
I'll be on my way.

632
01:12:54,252 --> 01:12:56,127
You shouldn't be here.

633
01:12:57,211 --> 01:12:59,127
He doesn't care.

634
01:12:59,252 --> 01:13:01,419
I mean you saw for yourself.

635
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:02,669
I care.

636
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:04,211
What are you telling me?

637
01:13:04,336 --> 01:13:07,461
That I'm not as important as what goes on in your head?

638
01:13:08,419 --> 01:13:11,044
There's just parts of me you can't have.

639
01:13:12,586 --> 01:13:14,252
No one can.

640
01:13:23,086 --> 01:13:25,169
Hey. You ok?

641
01:13:28,877 --> 01:13:31,336
I'd rather look at it at your place.

642
01:13:36,502 --> 01:13:38,544
What's this?

643
01:13:42,252 --> 01:13:44,169
Jesus Christ.

644
01:13:44,711 --> 01:13:46,669
Did she do this?

645
01:13:46,919 --> 01:13:49,211
Celia tell me, who did it?

646
01:13:50,794 --> 01:13:53,169
I don't want to talk about it. It wasn't mom.

647
01:13:58,127 --> 01:13:59,002
Hey where is he?

648
01:13:59,169 --> 01:14:00,336
Paul, what are you doing?

649
01:14:00,544 --> 01:14:01,752
Paul, what are you doing in my house?

650
01:14:02,127 --> 01:14:03,086
Where is he, Jackie?

651
01:14:03,252 --> 01:14:03,711
What's going on?

652
01:14:03,877 --> 01:14:04,752
Is this the asshole?

653
01:14:04,961 --> 01:14:05,961
What? Who the fuck is this?

654
01:14:06,002 --> 01:14:07,419
Shut the fuck up, Gareth!

655
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:08,502
Paul, would you leave?

656
01:14:08,586 --> 01:14:09,127
So this is the famous Paul.

657
01:14:11,336 --> 01:14:14,461
You like beating up little girls, do you. You know it's assault, is what it is.

658
01:14:14,669 --> 01:14:16,211
You touch her again. I'll kill you.

659
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:18,294
Is that right, mate?

660
01:14:18,377 --> 01:14:21,002
What do you call this, dickhead?

661
01:14:21,086 --> 01:14:22,502
I always mind my own fuckin' business.

662
01:14:26,419 --> 01:14:29,044
Get out of my house, you fuckin' pricks.

663
01:14:35,544 --> 01:14:37,336
Mind your fuckin' business.

664
01:14:38,294 --> 01:14:41,502
You cunt, you fuck off!
Is that clear?

665
01:14:42,627 --> 01:14:45,085
Still wanna fuckin' kill me, cunt?

666
01:14:45,085 --> 01:14:45,120
Gareth, Get the fuck inside.

667
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:47,085
Get the fuck inside!

668
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:53,585
You think you can come here and do this shit in front of my kids?

669
01:14:54,002 --> 01:14:56,127
Have you seen her fuckin' bruises? What did you think I was going to do?

670
01:14:56,210 --> 01:14:58,835
She got a lot more than she got. I want you to stay away from her.

671
01:14:59,377 --> 01:15:01,710
You changed the birth certificate.

672
01:15:02,127 --> 01:15:04,169
When were you going to tell her about that?

673
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:10,419
Just stay out of our lives, all right?

674
01:15:13,627 --> 01:15:15,335
Yeah.

675
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:18,085
See you around Paul, you fuckin' prick.

676
01:15:25,377 --> 01:15:26,794
Hello?

677
01:15:27,044 --> 01:15:28,585
Hello?

678
01:15:29,794 --> 01:15:31,377
Hello?

679
01:15:32,835 --> 01:15:34,585
Celia?

680
01:15:49,794 --> 01:15:51,835
She might have gone to Spain.

681
01:15:54,127 --> 01:15:55,585
No, no, no, wait.

682
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:58,460
My daughter plans on running off to Spain and he sees nothing.

683
01:15:58,544 --> 01:15:59,835
I don't call that irrelevant.

684
01:16:00,044 --> 01:16:02,335
Come on Jackie, it's not like it's the first time she's done something like this.

685
01:16:02,419 --> 01:16:03,919
Oh great.

686
01:16:04,585 --> 01:16:07,252
How good, this is good. So you are defending him now?

687
01:16:08,835 --> 01:16:11,669
Okay, so when exactly did she say she was running off to Spain?

688
01:16:11,752 --> 01:16:14,710
She didn't. She didn't say. All I knew is she had the ticket.

689
01:16:14,794 --> 01:16:17,294
I thought she was going to leave when school was finished. That's all.

690
01:16:17,377 --> 01:16:19,210
I didn't know what to think.

691
01:16:19,335 --> 01:16:22,085
Yeah well I know what I think. I think you are out of your mind.

692
01:16:22,502 --> 01:16:25,169
She made me promise not to tell a soul.

693
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:27,669
I'm her mother.

694
01:16:27,794 --> 01:16:29,419
OK?

695
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:32,544
When exactly did she make this promise Paul?

696
01:16:32,669 --> 01:16:34,460
Was it when you were plying her with alcohol?

697
01:16:34,585 --> 01:16:37,002
I wasn't plying her with alcohol. I gave her a glass, Jackie. A child could have drunk it.

698
01:16:37,085 --> 01:16:37,960
A child did drink it.

699
01:16:39,585 --> 01:16:41,502
Oh yeah. And did he think of that when he was punching the shit out of her?

700
01:16:41,877 --> 01:16:42,544
And the rest.

701
01:16:42,669 --> 01:16:44,335
Fuck off. Don't bring me into it.

702
01:16:44,419 --> 01:16:45,085
Sneaking up on her.

703
01:16:45,252 --> 01:16:47,169
Pissing in the toilet while she was lying in the bath.

704
01:16:47,252 --> 01:16:50,544
If it took her going half way around the world to get away from you, you fuckin' a-.

705
01:16:53,877 --> 01:16:54,710
You two stay in here.

706
01:16:54,919 --> 01:16:56,919
You, get in my office. I want a word alone.

707
01:17:00,044 --> 01:17:02,085
What's he talking about?

708
01:17:02,210 --> 01:17:03,919
What the fuck is he talking about

709
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:05,002
Nothing!

710
01:17:09,002 --> 01:17:11,794
Tell me about the last time you saw her. Everything.

711
01:17:11,919 --> 01:17:13,835
We were at the gate. She was carrying the atlas.

712
01:17:14,002 --> 01:17:15,169
She said goodbye and she left.

713
01:17:15,252 --> 01:17:16,210
No special goodbyes?

714
01:17:16,294 --> 01:17:17,252
No special goodbyes.

715
01:17:17,335 --> 01:17:19,252
No, she had a couple of books she hadn't got around to read

716
01:17:19,419 --> 01:17:20,585
and I told her she could keep them.

717
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:21,669
Names of these books?

718
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:23,210
Oh fuck say, what does it matter? I don't know.

719
01:17:25,377 --> 01:17:27,919
"Owls Do Cry", by Janet Frame, and another one,

720
01:17:28,544 --> 01:17:31,127
Camus, "The Outsider", I think it was.

721
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:34,710
That's Camus not canoe. C-a-m-u-s.

722
01:17:36,044 --> 01:17:38,169
You smug prick.

723
01:17:38,294 --> 01:17:41,085
Not all of us had to run off to Europe, mate.

724
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:18,210
Travel Diary

725
01:18:21,543 --> 01:18:23,377
passport

726
01:18:40,543 --> 01:18:42,418
"Missing girl, teacher, shared secret den"

727
01:18:42,627 --> 01:18:44,085
I guess you've seen this.

728
01:18:46,793 --> 01:18:49,127
Small town bloody gossip.

729
01:18:51,627 --> 01:18:54,002
I don't know what to do about this, Paul.

730
01:18:55,627 --> 01:18:58,168
The board of trustees have called a meeting.

731
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:03,918
You don't deserve this.

732
01:19:04,127 --> 01:19:04,960
You know it's fine, Pat.

733
01:19:05,252 --> 01:19:07,918
It's time I left anyway. Honestly.

734
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:12,043
Hey! Jonathan.

735
01:19:12,252 --> 01:19:13,918
Jonathan?

736
01:19:27,918 --> 01:19:29,585
Jonathan!

737
01:19:31,043 --> 01:19:32,752
Jonathan!

738
01:19:32,918 --> 01:19:34,377
Get in!

739
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:38,002
Jonathan, get in the car, it's bloody freezing.

740
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:40,793
Come on.

741
01:19:41,668 --> 01:19:43,377
Put your seat belt on.

742
01:19:48,502 --> 01:19:50,668
Were you having sex with her?

743
01:19:51,377 --> 01:19:53,043
What?

744
01:19:55,877 --> 01:19:57,877
You know who.

745
01:20:00,877 --> 01:20:02,627
Who said that?

746
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:05,293
Who said that?

747
01:20:08,668 --> 01:20:12,835
Kids at school, said you were giving her special coaching in bed.

748
01:20:19,877 --> 01:20:21,710
And you believed them?

749
01:20:26,335 --> 01:20:28,002
Huh, and you believed

750
01:20:36,877 --> 01:20:39,960
How's that camera going? I haven't seen you with it lately.

751
01:21:07,752 --> 01:21:11,085
As the days went on, more and more people went looking.

752
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:22,877
The people searched far and wide

753
01:21:23,043 --> 01:21:25,627
but the ocean had vanished without a trace.

754
01:21:31,502 --> 01:21:34,168
The quiet land once bountiful

755
01:21:34,335 --> 01:21:36,627
had become hard and unyielding.

756
01:21:47,376 --> 01:21:49,835
Then a shape appeared on the horizon.

757
01:21:51,876 --> 01:21:54,293
Through a blaze of hate the people saw

758
01:21:54,418 --> 01:21:57,543
what looked like tumbling water rolling towards them.

759
01:21:59,751 --> 01:22:01,668
A wave of excitement passed through the town

760
01:22:01,835 --> 01:22:05,085
as they anxiously watched the ocean return.

761
01:22:06,001 --> 01:22:08,210
But as it grew closer the shape began to alter and mutate.

762
01:22:11,668 --> 01:22:15,835
What looked like tumbling water was in fact wild horses.

763
01:22:18,001 --> 01:22:21,793
Everywhere they turned they saw horses drawing closer and closer.

764
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:25,210
Their excitement turned to fear.

765
01:22:26,335 --> 01:22:28,335
And their fear became panic,

766
01:22:31,001 --> 01:22:33,876
for it seemed that nothing could stop their advance.

767
01:22:36,043 --> 01:22:38,751
Which as the ocean's disappearance

768
01:22:39,251 --> 01:22:41,335
had come without warning.

769
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:46,751
But then no one,

770
01:22:46,876 --> 01:22:48,835
not even for a moment,

771
01:22:49,001 --> 01:22:52,751
had stopped to question why the ocean had left in the first place.

772
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:11,126
Mr. Prior?

773
01:23:11,501 --> 01:23:14,626
I am Detective Inspector Farnon from Wellington CIV.

774
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:16,710
This is Detective Dunleavy.

775
01:23:16,793 --> 01:23:18,626
I've a warrant to search these premises.

776
01:23:18,710 --> 01:23:21,835
And I'll need you to accompany me to the station for questioning.

777
01:23:23,835 --> 01:23:26,751
I'll need your passport and keys to your car.

778
01:23:29,251 --> 01:23:32,793
I believe there's a shed where Celia used to visit you.

779
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:44,293
Right then, let's get you home.

780
01:24:04,251 --> 01:24:07,210
Why did Celia come to your place last Sunday?

781
01:24:10,501 --> 01:24:11,710
Did you hear the question?

782
01:24:12,168 --> 01:24:12,751
Yes.

783
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:16,585
I understand she visited you regularly.

784
01:24:17,335 --> 01:24:19,626
What was the nature of the visits?

785
01:24:19,835 --> 01:24:21,168
We talked about things.

786
01:24:21,418 --> 01:24:22,210
What things?

787
01:24:22,335 --> 01:24:23,918
Europe.

788
01:24:24,210 --> 01:24:26,043
Books.

789
01:24:27,751 --> 01:24:30,043
Celia wants to be a writer.

790
01:24:41,251 --> 01:24:43,835
I am not flesh. I am not blood.

791
01:24:44,085 --> 01:24:46,793
They can look all they like but they'll never see me.

792
01:24:46,918 --> 01:24:50,460
If I never hear your love or hold your hand again in this life,

793
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:53,335
promise me we will touch when I am dead.

794
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:58,210
It's called 'Poem for a Lonely Friend'.

795
01:24:59,501 --> 01:25:02,251
Would you consider yourself lonely, Paul?

796
01:25:11,418 --> 01:25:13,085
Thank you.

797
01:25:14,001 --> 01:25:16,584
Would you keep that door closed, please.

798
01:25:22,043 --> 01:25:25,209
Why did Celia keep visiting you even though her parents had forbidden it?

799
01:25:25,293 --> 01:25:26,251
Parents?

800
01:25:26,286 --> 01:25:27,209
Mother.

801
01:25:27,751 --> 01:25:30,168
I guess she saw something in me.

802
01:25:30,918 --> 01:25:32,959
And what was that?

803
01:25:33,251 --> 01:25:35,168
Well, I'm not Celia.

804
01:25:35,293 --> 01:25:38,418
Then perhaps you'd like to tell me what it was you saw in her?

805
01:25:41,376 --> 01:25:43,626
I know this is diffi-

806
01:25:47,001 --> 01:25:49,084
I remember being her.

807
01:26:07,418 --> 01:26:09,043
What did you do this time?

808
01:26:09,501 --> 01:26:10,709
Come on, leave me alone now.

809
01:26:10,834 --> 01:26:12,418
Go away.

810
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:15,751
Just fuckin' go, come on, leave me alone.

811
01:26:15,876 --> 01:26:17,918
I don't need this shit, Celia. Just go.

812
01:26:18,293 --> 01:26:18,959
What?

813
01:26:20,126 --> 01:26:21,209
Did mom say something to you?

814
01:26:21,501 --> 01:26:23,293
Your mum threatened to ring the school, yeah.

815
01:26:23,376 --> 01:26:24,209
Okay?

816
01:26:24,418 --> 01:26:25,668
No, it's not ok.

817
01:26:26,293 --> 01:26:29,126
God, she's so fuckin' presumptuous.

818
01:26:30,543 --> 01:26:33,001
Who the fuck cares what she thinks?

819
01:26:33,168 --> 01:26:36,043
She's got a fuckin' boyfriend he wears boat shoes.

820
01:26:36,168 --> 01:26:38,918
He brought her a pair now they're both wearing them.

821
01:26:39,334 --> 01:26:42,001
You never see a fuckin' boat around here.

822
01:26:48,084 --> 01:26:50,251
I just came to tell you that I entered the contest.

823
01:26:50,459 --> 01:26:52,084
Well that's great, now get going.

824
01:26:52,543 --> 01:26:54,168
It's not illegal that we're friends or something, Paul.

825
01:26:58,501 --> 01:27:01,959
It was you who said that we shouldn't care what other people think of us.

826
01:27:09,709 --> 01:27:11,668
Or were you just saying that?

827
01:27:53,376 --> 01:27:56,543
You know how you and mom used to go out and now it me and you that are friends.

828
01:28:00,126 --> 01:28:02,793
I feel like I've known you my whole life.

829
01:28:02,959 --> 01:28:05,251
Yeah well, it's a small world.

830
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:07,626
It isn't a small world.

831
01:28:10,959 --> 01:28:12,876
Were you guys in love?

832
01:28:17,543 --> 01:28:21,001
There must've been something going on if you tattooed each others feet.

833
01:28:24,418 --> 01:28:26,418
It's a little hard to imagine what you saw in her.

834
01:28:26,543 --> 01:28:29,626
Well, you're not the first person to feel that way about their parents.

835
01:28:30,793 --> 01:28:33,209
Anyway, it's a long time ago.

836
01:28:36,251 --> 01:28:38,376
I know it wasn't planned.

837
01:28:39,293 --> 01:28:41,501
Mom was only 16.

838
01:28:48,876 --> 01:28:51,542
You'd tell me if you knew anything, eh?

839
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:01,167
Is that a promise?

840
01:29:07,751 --> 01:29:09,251
Oh stuff it.

841
01:29:09,501 --> 01:29:12,209
Let's get wet. Come on.

842
01:29:13,667 --> 01:29:18,459
Mazzy Star "Take Everything"

843
01:29:56,126 --> 01:29:56,876
Oh, geez!

844
01:29:57,167 --> 01:29:58,959
Andrew, Jonathan?

845
01:29:59,042 --> 01:30:02,584
We were on our way home from church and thought we'd stop in for a cuppa.

846
01:30:03,126 --> 01:30:04,709
Fuck.

847
01:30:05,667 --> 01:30:07,626
It's freezing!

848
01:30:17,542 --> 01:30:19,709
Have you see this new thing that they're building?

849
01:30:19,834 --> 01:30:22,251
It looks like a giant barn.

850
01:30:25,334 --> 01:30:27,334
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

851
01:30:37,084 --> 01:30:39,126
I'll put the kettle on.

852
01:30:52,042 --> 01:30:53,667
Family and friends of Celia Steimer

853
01:30:54,126 --> 01:30:55,751
are doing everything possible to help police find her.

854
01:30:55,876 --> 01:30:59,209
More than 50 volunteers are now scouring waterways and bushlands

855
01:30:59,334 --> 01:31:00,917
in the Marshall road forest.

856
01:31:01,084 --> 01:31:03,584
The 16-year-old Rapari Junction HS student

857
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:05,834
has been missing now for more than a week.

858
01:31:06,001 --> 01:31:07,751
Detective Robin Farland says

859
01:31:07,834 --> 01:31:10,459
they have to consider every option.

860
01:31:10,584 --> 01:31:13,709
She acknowledged a local man is helping them with their inquiries

861
01:31:13,917 --> 01:31:15,792
and the police will be visiting every house in the area.

862
01:31:34,626 --> 01:31:36,376
He'll be fine.

863
01:31:37,334 --> 01:31:39,084
Let them handle it.

864
01:32:24,875 --> 01:32:26,125
Please just use an ashtray.

865
01:32:26,459 --> 01:32:27,167
Okay.

866
01:32:28,417 --> 01:32:30,959
Listen, I spoke to the lawyer in Alexandria

867
01:32:31,084 --> 01:32:33,667
and he reckons he's handled this sort of thing before.

868
01:32:34,834 --> 01:32:37,375
He wants you to give him a call first thing in the morning.

869
01:32:39,125 --> 01:32:44,125
Hey, what sexual position creates the ugliest offspring?

870
01:32:47,709 --> 01:32:49,334
What sexual position creates-

871
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:50,375
I don't know, Paul.

872
01:32:51,334 --> 01:32:53,459
Ask your mother.

873
01:32:56,209 --> 01:32:58,542
Can you imagine if she saw us now?

874
01:32:58,834 --> 01:33:01,334
Can you imagine that? What do you think she'd say?

875
01:33:02,042 --> 01:33:04,250
Two brothers having a drink and a chat.

876
01:33:04,375 --> 01:33:07,000
What do you think? She'd be proud, or what?

877
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:11,625
Why are you doing this?

878
01:33:11,959 --> 01:33:12,667
Doing what?

879
01:33:13,042 --> 01:33:14,292
You know exactly what.

880
01:33:15,125 --> 01:33:16,375
Why can't you just talk to me?

881
01:33:24,292 --> 01:33:26,084
Fuck you.

882
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:30,917
What the fuck are you looking at? Never seen two brothers talking before?

883
01:33:38,584 --> 01:33:40,959
You want to talk, let's talk.

884
01:33:41,084 --> 01:33:43,209
Forget the fact you come in here blind drunk

885
01:33:43,292 --> 01:33:46,584
and interrupt a meeting but then you just bring up mom like that?

886
01:33:46,792 --> 01:33:49,834
I mean how dare you? I realize you are in a spot of bother, Paul,

887
01:33:49,917 --> 01:33:52,625
but that doesn't give you the right to behave like this.

888
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:55,084
The truth? You were never there for mom.

889
01:33:55,167 --> 01:33:57,209
When she was sick, where the hell were you?

890
01:33:57,292 --> 01:33:59,167
Brilliant. So you do have an opinion. OK Andrew.

891
01:33:59,375 --> 01:34:00,834
What the fuck is that supposed to mean? I couldn't get near her.

892
01:34:00,917 --> 01:34:04,417
Blame it all on me. I had to be you. Did you know that?

893
01:34:04,542 --> 01:34:07,084
You made fuckin' sure of it.

894
01:34:07,167 --> 01:34:09,125
The happy little fuckin' threesome: Andy, mom and God.

895
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:09,917
No one else invited.

896
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,209
You abandoned her.

897
01:34:11,292 --> 01:34:14,709
You abandoned her, Paul. And you never took one single step towards-

898
01:34:16,334 --> 01:34:18,792
at least for all his faults, he let me in. He let me in.

899
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:22,334
You were late for his funeral, remember? And you're gonna stand here defending for him.

900
01:34:22,542 --> 01:34:25,125
Listen to me Paul, you listen, listen to me.

901
01:34:27,042 --> 01:34:29,125
You know sometimes I look at you

902
01:34:29,209 --> 01:34:31,250
and all I see is him.

903
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:34,417
Just him.

904
01:34:34,584 --> 01:34:36,792
I find that quite disheartening.

905
01:34:41,959 --> 01:34:45,125
Yeah well, at least I didn't marry my fuckin' mother.

906
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,042
Has she always been like that or just when she met you?

907
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:57,334
Go to hell, Paul.

908
01:35:10,375 --> 01:35:14,625
Police confirm blood traces belong to missing girl.

909
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:18,209
Just open it!

910
01:36:53,042 --> 01:36:55,208
Celia, give me the fuckin' letter carta.

911
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,667
It doesn't matter.

912
01:37:13,333 --> 01:37:14,750
Open it. Will you just open it?

913
01:37:14,917 --> 01:37:15,792
No! Don't open it.

914
01:37:16,417 --> 01:37:17,292
Open it!

915
01:37:17,458 --> 01:37:18,333
I don't want to.

916
01:37:24,375 --> 01:37:25,083
No?

917
01:37:25,417 --> 01:37:26,125
No.

918
01:37:47,333 --> 01:37:49,708
Wonder who came in first?

919
01:38:02,208 --> 01:38:03,917
Amid the 2000 or so entries

920
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
we were delighted with Ms Steimers' story.

921
01:38:06,125 --> 01:38:09,208
This work shows an emerging remarkable talent for someone so young.

922
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:12,125
It catches a sense of beauty, mystery and loss

923
01:38:12,208 --> 01:38:14,625
without ever losing sight of what might be.

924
01:38:15,125 --> 01:38:17,292
You wonder who came first?

925
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,333
I'll tell you who came first.

926
01:38:23,458 --> 01:38:26,875
Someone three times your age, probably, someone who bloody well deserved to come first.

927
01:38:43,708 --> 01:38:46,208
Thank you for making it special for me.

928
01:38:49,625 --> 01:38:51,375
The den and everything.

929
01:39:03,625 --> 01:39:06,667
I need a cigarette to cope with this sort of scenery.

930
01:39:07,208 --> 01:39:09,125
In the car. I'll be back in a tic.

931
01:39:09,375 --> 01:39:11,417
Can you leave me your jacket?

932
01:40:14,833 --> 01:40:18,791
Are you gonna be home tonight? I need you to baby sit Sam.

933
01:40:22,666 --> 01:40:24,958
Celia, I asked you a question.

934
01:40:40,291 --> 01:40:41,875
Fuck!

935
01:41:07,166 --> 01:41:09,250
Is he my father?

936
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:21,958
I wish it were that simple.

937
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:35,250
Hey, you!

938
01:41:39,208 --> 01:41:40,750
What's up?

939
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,708
Did you know?

940
01:42:03,291 --> 01:42:04,833
Did you know?

941
01:42:05,458 --> 01:42:08,250
Answer me! Did you know?

942
01:42:09,458 --> 01:42:11,291
Oh, Celia...

943
01:42:17,333 --> 01:42:20,416
I know what you did when you took the photo of that girl.

944
01:42:21,625 --> 01:42:23,791
You walked away and left her.

945
01:42:23,958 --> 01:42:27,041
That's why you withdrew the entry so you wouldn't even have to deal with her.

946
01:42:27,791 --> 01:42:28,708
You don't know-

947
01:42:28,833 --> 01:42:29,750
don't!

948
01:42:31,375 --> 01:42:33,458
Was she just another photo?

949
01:42:35,083 --> 01:42:38,916
Just another picture of this fuckin' war puzzle that you try to figure out?

950
01:42:42,124 --> 01:42:44,166
Was she just like me?

951
01:42:44,791 --> 01:42:46,249
Was she just like me?

952
01:42:46,416 --> 01:42:50,624
Was she just someone you could pick up and throw away and forget about?

953
01:43:01,374 --> 01:43:03,833
How do you live with yourself?

954
01:43:21,624 --> 01:43:23,708
Andrew! Penny!

955
01:43:24,249 --> 01:43:25,791
Are you there?

956
01:43:28,249 --> 01:43:30,083
Will you just open the door?

957
01:43:33,999 --> 01:43:36,041
I just need somewhere to stay.

958
01:43:40,874 --> 01:43:42,874
Come on Penny, I know you're in there.

959
01:44:05,708 --> 01:44:08,166
You know Jonathan, all that stuff in the papers,

960
01:44:08,374 --> 01:44:10,374
that's all just speculation.

961
01:44:10,874 --> 01:44:13,208
All right? It's rubbish.

962
01:44:13,333 --> 01:44:15,374
They have no proof.

963
01:44:21,083 --> 01:44:23,124
I'm still your uncle.

964
01:44:28,999 --> 01:44:30,708
No you're not.

965
01:44:30,833 --> 01:44:32,874
We both think you're fuckin' stupid.

966
01:44:32,999 --> 01:44:33,958
What did you say?

967
01:44:34,041 --> 01:44:34,999
Leave me alone!

968
01:44:35,124 --> 01:44:38,083
I hope they kill you.

969
01:44:38,208 --> 01:44:40,583
I hope they-

970
01:44:40,791 --> 01:44:43,083
It's okay!

971
01:44:48,166 --> 01:44:51,124
It's alright. I know you like her.

972
01:44:54,833 --> 01:44:57,166
Listen, you have to tell me what you meant by "both of you".

973
01:44:58,166 --> 01:44:59,333
Look at me.

974
01:44:59,458 --> 01:45:02,041
What did you mean by "both of us think you're stupid"?

975
01:45:02,124 --> 01:45:04,499
Tell me what you meant by "both of us".

976
01:45:04,624 --> 01:45:07,541
I'm not gonna hurt you. I promise I won't hurt you.

977
01:45:12,833 --> 01:45:14,333
What is it, Jonathan?

978
01:45:15,458 --> 01:45:17,791
I was looking for my camera.

979
01:45:42,041 --> 01:45:44,833
I thought he was hiding it to protect you.

980
01:45:49,833 --> 01:45:51,416
Where is he?

981
01:45:51,583 --> 01:45:54,166
In Christchurch till tomorrow.

982
01:46:06,249 --> 01:46:07,791
Paul!

983
01:46:09,208 --> 01:46:10,874
Paul, are you there?

984
01:46:14,874 --> 01:46:16,166
RIVER

985
01:46:28,999 --> 01:46:31,291
I just heard from the lawyer.

986
01:46:31,416 --> 01:46:33,249
What do you mean you don't want to sell?

987
01:46:33,374 --> 01:46:35,457
You can't. I'm up to my eyeballs-

988
01:46:39,624 --> 01:46:40,957
What the hell did you do that for?

989
01:46:41,082 --> 01:46:41,999
Get up!

990
01:46:42,874 --> 01:46:44,707
Get up!

991
01:46:48,457 --> 01:46:51,707
What were you going to do? Plant it at my place like the atlas?

992
01:46:51,832 --> 01:46:53,791
This is really unnecessary

993
01:46:53,916 --> 01:46:55,791
Okay! Okay!

994
01:47:03,082 --> 01:47:05,874
There was a time I wondered why you up and left.

995
01:47:06,916 --> 01:47:09,374
You knew what he was up to, didn't you?

996
01:47:09,874 --> 01:47:11,749
At least look at me and tell me

997
01:47:11,832 --> 01:47:13,791
before you pull the trigger.

998
01:47:17,666 --> 01:47:19,666
You know the really sad part?

999
01:47:20,791 --> 01:47:23,499
I didn't even find out until I read the will.

1000
01:47:23,666 --> 01:47:25,957
That's how far back I was.

1001
01:47:26,666 --> 01:47:28,624
But then how was I to know, Paul?

1002
01:47:28,749 --> 01:47:31,291
I was only a kid, a 15-year-old kid.

1003
01:47:32,457 --> 01:47:35,916
You killed me when you walked away and left me with that evil piece of scum.

1004
01:47:35,999 --> 01:47:38,957
You think you even get a second fuckin' chance?

1005
01:47:39,041 --> 01:47:40,832
You knew, you bastard!

1006
01:47:40,957 --> 01:47:44,416
And you had the gall to come back here and bring that thing into our house.

1007
01:47:44,541 --> 01:47:46,582
My mother's house!

1008
01:47:46,916 --> 01:47:50,041
And god knows what you're doing with her, but then like father like son.

1009
01:47:50,124 --> 01:47:52,624
Andrew, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

1010
01:48:02,916 --> 01:48:05,082
He was screwing that teenage whore of yours.

1011
01:48:05,166 --> 01:48:05,582
No!

1012
01:48:05,791 --> 01:48:06,624
He was. You knew it.

1013
01:48:06,707 --> 01:48:08,166
And you walked.

1014
01:48:08,249 --> 01:48:10,124
Andrew no! It's got nothing to fuckin' do with you!

1015
01:48:10,332 --> 01:48:11,666
You saw it with your own eyes!

1016
01:48:11,957 --> 01:48:14,249
You knew and you walked and you never looked back.

1017
01:48:14,332 --> 01:48:15,666
What did you do to her?

1018
01:48:15,749 --> 01:48:18,207
Our mother died the moment that bastard was conceived.

1019
01:48:18,291 --> 01:48:19,916
Just tell me.

1020
01:48:23,249 --> 01:48:28,291
Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate,

1021
01:48:28,374 --> 01:48:31,582
saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing.

1022
01:48:43,624 --> 01:48:44,999
Tell me!

1023
01:48:45,207 --> 01:48:46,041
Go ahead and cry.

1024
01:48:46,332 --> 01:48:48,207
It's about time you cried for our mother.

1025
01:48:48,416 --> 01:48:49,874
I'll kill you. I fuckin' swear I'll kill you.

1026
01:48:53,249 --> 01:48:55,124
I told her everything.

1027
01:48:55,499 --> 01:48:56,957
Everything!

1028
01:48:57,707 --> 01:49:00,041
Someone had to set the record straight.

1029
01:49:01,374 --> 01:49:03,332
I had a right to that money, Paul.

1030
01:49:03,457 --> 01:49:06,374
That money was mine if nothing else, at least that.

1031
01:49:10,207 --> 01:49:13,874
And I should give her a third at 18 along with a nice little letter.

1032
01:49:14,707 --> 01:49:17,874
Rather convenient, eh? Nice and smooth.

1033
01:49:19,749 --> 01:49:21,666
She wanted proof.

1034
01:49:24,791 --> 01:49:26,499
She asked to see the will.

1035
01:49:31,166 --> 01:49:32,707
Wait here.

1036
01:49:44,665 --> 01:49:46,624
Mom was there.

1037
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:48,374
She...

1038
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:50,124
What?

1039
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:55,582
What?

1040
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:30,082
What are you doing in here?

1041
01:50:30,624 --> 01:50:32,165
I was just looking.

1042
01:50:32,832 --> 01:50:34,665
Who are you

1043
01:50:34,790 --> 01:50:36,832
He brought me here.

1044
01:50:41,624 --> 01:50:43,249
I know what you are.

1045
01:50:43,374 --> 01:50:45,915
You have no right to be in my house.

1046
01:50:46,582 --> 01:50:50,624
I want you to stay away from my family. Is that clear? Stay away.

1047
01:50:55,457 --> 01:50:57,790
So he told you about me.

1048
01:51:00,624 --> 01:51:02,499
Haven't you told her?

1049
01:51:05,207 --> 01:51:07,415
I told you to wait outside.

1050
01:51:09,915 --> 01:51:11,957
Is it true, Andrew?

1051
01:51:24,665 --> 01:51:26,332
You people.

1052
01:51:27,165 --> 01:51:29,040
Get out!

1053
01:51:40,332 --> 01:51:41,957
She smiled, Paul.

1054
01:51:43,624 --> 01:51:45,707
Simple misunderstanding.

1055
01:51:48,082 --> 01:51:50,124
What's done is done.

1056
01:52:03,249 --> 01:52:05,707
For what it's worth mum wants it this way.

1057
01:54:03,123 --> 01:54:04,832
Uncle Paul?

1058
01:54:04,957 --> 01:54:06,665
Jonathan...

1059
01:54:06,915 --> 01:54:08,748
Can you come over?

1060
01:55:14,415 --> 01:55:16,207
I rang the police.

1061
01:55:16,832 --> 01:55:18,582
Am I in trouble?

1062
01:55:32,873 --> 01:55:34,457
No, you're not.

1063
01:55:39,123 --> 01:55:43,832
Mazzy Star "Into Dust"

1064
01:57:16,165 --> 01:57:17,748
Paul, wait!

1065
01:57:18,456 --> 01:57:20,290
Paul, wait!

1066
01:57:21,456 --> 01:57:23,290
Paul, come back home!

1067
01:57:24,998 --> 01:57:27,248
Paul, don't leave!

1068
01:57:30,915 --> 01:57:33,206
Paul!

1069
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:46,915
The people had no choice

1070
01:57:46,998 --> 01:57:49,748
but to trust that the horses would lead them to their ocean.

1071
01:57:54,998 --> 01:57:56,790
Without reins or saddles

1072
01:57:56,915 --> 01:57:59,581
they rode the horses across the barren land.

1073
01:58:08,290 --> 01:58:10,790
But the ocean had disappeared for good.

1074
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:22,165
And the people, together and alone had no choice

1075
01:58:22,415 --> 01:58:25,498
but to face each other in their loss.

1076
01:58:27,748 --> 01:58:30,623
They made a home for themselves in a new environment.

1077
01:58:31,956 --> 01:58:34,415
Although one that had changed forever.

1078
01:58:37,248 --> 01:58:40,165
They learnt to live in the space that the ocean had left.

1079
01:58:43,998 --> 01:58:46,373
One day the tide went away

1080
01:58:46,498 --> 01:58:49,248
Although it lingered in their dreams.

1081
01:58:58,290 --> 01:58:59,748
Celia!

1082
01:59:01,831 --> 01:59:04,248
Your e-mail said it was urgent.

1083
01:59:06,456 --> 01:59:08,040
Yeah,

1084
01:59:08,540 --> 01:59:10,665
I just wanted to see you.

1085
01:59:11,873 --> 01:59:13,915
I've just been reading your story.

1086
01:59:16,081 --> 01:59:18,540
So, you want to come in?Have a cup of tea?

1087
01:59:22,040 --> 01:59:24,165
I'll make you a macchito.

1088
01:59:28,831 --> 01:59:30,748
I wanted to give you this.

1089
01:59:32,956 --> 01:59:34,415
It's a bit out of date.

1090
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:37,456
I don't think the world has changed that much in 25 years.

1091
01:59:39,831 --> 01:59:42,123
Have a look inside.

1092
01:59:51,748 --> 01:59:52,665
What's this?

1093
01:59:52,790 --> 01:59:53,998
What do you think it is?

1094
01:59:56,915 --> 01:59:59,665
It's open. So you can use it anytime you like.

1095
02:00:00,623 --> 02:00:02,998
You can leave after school's finished.

1096
02:00:08,956 --> 02:00:10,873
Hey, Celia, this is not some pathetic attempt

1097
02:00:10,998 --> 02:00:13,581
to make everything all right.

1098
02:00:16,081 --> 02:00:17,748
It's just-

1099
02:00:19,414 --> 02:00:21,664
the ticket is just a gift.

1100
02:00:25,539 --> 02:00:27,039
You knew about

1101
02:00:27,206 --> 02:00:29,581
mum and your father together.

1102
02:00:32,248 --> 02:00:34,414
But I didn't know about you.

1103
02:00:39,081 --> 02:00:40,748
Why didn't you just tell me?

1104
02:00:41,164 --> 02:00:42,206
I didn't know how.

1105
02:00:44,248 --> 02:00:45,998
I'm sorry.

1106
02:00:52,789 --> 02:00:54,206
Look...

1107
02:00:57,206 --> 02:00:58,998
in Spain,

1108
02:01:00,664 --> 02:01:03,373
there's a place called Andaluzia.

1109
02:01:05,123 --> 02:01:07,664
It's hot and it's white and dusty.

1110
02:01:08,706 --> 02:01:10,914
And you can see the ocean.

1111
02:01:13,289 --> 02:01:14,831
This is it.

1112
02:01:24,164 --> 02:01:25,289
I can drive you home.

1113
02:01:25,539 --> 02:01:27,039
It's Okay. I can walk.

1114
02:01:34,831 --> 02:01:36,289
Paul?

1115
02:01:38,956 --> 02:01:39,873
About the ticket.

1116
02:01:41,039 --> 02:01:41,956
Don't worry about it, of course.

1117
02:01:42,373 --> 02:01:43,373
Promise?

1118
02:01:43,414 --> 02:01:44,414
Yeah.

1119
02:01:44,539 --> 02:01:46,206
It's our secret.

1120
02:01:48,081 --> 02:01:50,456
Es nuestro secreto.

1121
02:01:52,206 --> 02:01:54,498
I thought you couldn't speak Spanish.

1122
02:02:05,081 --> 02:02:06,831
Adios, brother.

1123
02:02:18,623 --> 02:02:20,331
Bye, Celia.
