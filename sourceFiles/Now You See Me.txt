1
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:35,882
<i>Come in close.</i>

2
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:38,438
<i>Closer.</i>

3
00:00:39,283 --> 00:00:42,325
<i>Because the more you think, you see,</i>

4
00:00:42,314 --> 00:00:44,760
<i>the easier it'll be to fool you.</i>

5
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:48,283
<i>Because what is seeing?</i>

6
00:00:48,394 --> 00:00:52,399
<i>You're looking, but what you're really doing
is filtering, interpreting,</i>

7
00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:54,442
<i>searching for meaning.</i>

8
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:57,674
<i>My job?</i>

9
00:00:57,754 --> 00:01:01,759
<i>To take that most precious of gifts
you give me, your attention,</i>

10
00:01:04,634 --> 00:01:06,716
<i>and use it against you.</i>

11
00:01:11,874 --> 00:01:14,081
I'm going to flip through this deck.

12
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:15,644
And I want you to see one card.

13
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:17,165
Not this one. That's too obvious.

14
00:01:17,554 --> 00:01:18,885
Pay close attention.

15
00:01:21,434 --> 00:01:22,765
That was too fast. I'll do it again.

16
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:24,040
Are you ready?

17
00:01:24,114 --> 00:01:25,115
Okay.

18
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,963
- Now did you see one?
- Yes.

19
00:01:29,114 --> 00:01:31,037
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

20
00:01:31,234 --> 00:01:32,963
Now, do you see your card here?

21
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:34,561
No.

22
00:01:34,634 --> 00:01:36,841
That's because you're looking too closely.

23
00:01:36,914 --> 00:01:38,962
And what have I been telling you all night?

24
00:01:39,034 --> 00:01:40,524
The closer you look...

25
00:01:40,594 --> 00:01:42,164
The less you see.

26
00:02:05,354 --> 00:02:07,800
Now look into my eyes.

27
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:10,042
And sleep. Okay.

28
00:02:13,354 --> 00:02:14,560
And...

29
00:02:15,714 --> 00:02:18,320
If you can get this bill
from me, you can have it.

30
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:20,357
Go ahead. Take it. Get it.

31
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:23,080
If you can say your name, you can have it.

32
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:28,635
All right, just hang out there, wriggle a sec.

33
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:31,115
I'm gonna take a little peek under the hood

34
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:32,719
-of your hubby's brain.
- Oh, no, no, no.

35
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:33,960
I'm picturing...

36
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:36,036
- Don't tell me.
- Of course.

37
00:02:36,234 --> 00:02:38,236
Beach. Cocktails.

38
00:02:38,714 --> 00:02:39,875
Florida?

39
00:02:39,954 --> 00:02:41,444
Look, it was a business trip.

40
00:02:41,634 --> 00:02:43,636
I mean, it is a kind of business.

41
00:02:43,714 --> 00:02:46,604
Maybe the oldest business.

42
00:02:46,714 --> 00:02:47,920
You know what, Honey Bee, let's...

43
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,559
She can't move, Mack.

44
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:51,045
You're thinking of a woman's name.

45
00:02:51,234 --> 00:02:52,599
A! B! C!

46
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:53,914
DI El Fl GI

47
00:02:53,994 --> 00:02:55,120
H, I, J...

48
00:02:55,234 --> 00:02:57,043
J? Jean. Jane. Janet.

49
00:02:57,274 --> 00:02:58,355
Who's Janet?

50
00:02:59,954 --> 00:03:01,194
You know Janet?

51
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,554
It's not your best friend, is it?

52
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:05,564
- Your sister?
- No, please.

53
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:07,875
Her sister? Oh, my God.

54
00:03:07,994 --> 00:03:10,042
You weren't away on business.

55
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:11,843
- You were away on Janet.
- No.

56
00:03:11,954 --> 00:03:13,240
Your wife's sister!

57
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,923
Okay, we need to move over here,

58
00:03:15,994 --> 00:03:18,520
because it seems like
she's a little bit upset right now.

59
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:20,835
You want this to go away?

60
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:22,564
- Yes.
- Okay, pull out your wallet.

61
00:03:23,114 --> 00:03:24,604
Come on, get it out.

62
00:03:24,674 --> 00:03:25,960
Do you shake down everybody like this?

63
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:27,838
No, only the special few.

64
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:29,996
What is this? Two hundred seem fair?

65
00:03:30,074 --> 00:03:32,156
You know what?
This is a big deal. Let's go $250.

66
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:33,235
You're a stick-up artist.

67
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:34,998
Yeah. Of course.

68
00:03:35,754 --> 00:03:38,564
Okay, and sleep!

69
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:39,999
Now, when I snap my fingers,

70
00:03:40,074 --> 00:03:41,564
you won't remember any of this.

71
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:42,840
<i>And you, Warren Beam],</i>

72
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:45,918
every time you see or even think of Janet,

73
00:03:46,274 --> 00:03:48,720
you're gonna picture me naked.

74
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:49,920
And that's not a pretty sight.

75
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:51,035
Yeah.

76
00:03:51,114 --> 00:03:53,276
And... You're wide awake!

77
00:03:56,354 --> 00:03:58,880
Well, we did the best we could,

78
00:03:58,954 --> 00:04:01,116
but some people
just aren't to be hypnotized.

79
00:04:01,194 --> 00:04:03,481
- I did it wrong?
- Come on, Honey Bee.

80
00:04:03,594 --> 00:04:05,278
- Oh, no, you did it fine.
- Let me buy you dinner.

81
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:06,640
Look after her.

82
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,443
Just have to hit an ATM first.

83
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:26,201
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am the next great magician,

84
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:28,436
and I will give $100

85
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:30,835
to anyone who can tell me
how this trick is done.

86
00:04:31,074 --> 00:04:34,556
I have an ordinary spoon from Mel's Deli,
right here in Brooklyn.

87
00:04:34,634 --> 00:04:36,079
Check it out.

88
00:04:36,154 --> 00:04:39,840
Now, everyone
please pay very, very close attention.

89
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:43,402
Because I'm about to
bend this spoon with my mind.

90
00:04:53,634 --> 00:04:56,001
Thank you. Thank you. Pass that around.

91
00:04:56,074 --> 00:04:57,599
- What's this?
- What are you doing, man?

92
00:04:57,674 --> 00:05:00,917
Look at this! Looks like
we got a spoon and a stem.

93
00:05:00,994 --> 00:05:02,120
I've got other tricks.

94
00:05:02,194 --> 00:05:04,435
Or you could give me my 100 bucks.

95
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:05,595
You said you would.

96
00:05:05,674 --> 00:05:06,914
Nice wallet.

97
00:05:06,994 --> 00:05:08,234
You have a very good eye, sir.

98
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:09,315
Thanks.

99
00:05:16,474 --> 00:05:17,805
Wallet.

100
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:20,196
My wallet. My watch!

101
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:25,955
Stop that guy!

102
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,160
Stop that guy in the leather jacket!

103
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:28,235
He's got my wallet!

104
00:05:36,674 --> 00:05:38,039
Okay, Los Angeles,

105
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:39,798
are we ready to end this thing?

106
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:40,875
Yeah!

107
00:05:40,954 --> 00:05:43,002
When that timer hits zero,

108
00:05:43,474 --> 00:05:45,795
a tank full of flesh-eating piranhas

109
00:05:45,874 --> 00:05:47,797
will fall from above.

110
00:05:47,874 --> 00:05:50,605
A lady has to have handcuffs. Right, girls?

111
00:05:50,874 --> 00:05:53,559
One, two, three!

112
00:06:11,194 --> 00:06:12,195
Yeah!

113
00:06:22,554 --> 00:06:24,238
Help! Stop it!

114
00:06:26,154 --> 00:06:27,918
She's serious! She can't get out!

115
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:31,524
Go get some help!

116
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:33,395
Help, dude!

117
00:06:34,914 --> 00:06:37,235
Get out of the way! Move! Move!

118
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:18,282
Come On! This is bullshit!

119
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:21,603
Whoever thought of this is a sick sadist!

120
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:27,280
Yes!

121
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,644
I am your biggest fan.

122
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:32,677
I could tell by the way
you're attacking my face right now.

123
00:07:32,754 --> 00:07:33,994
Close the door. Bad apartment building.

124
00:07:34,074 --> 00:07:35,678
- Magician, come here.
- Okay.

125
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:39,324
- Wait, wait.
- What? What?

126
00:07:39,394 --> 00:07:40,884
How did you do that...

127
00:07:40,954 --> 00:07:42,285
The seven of diamonds
on the side of the tower?

128
00:07:42,354 --> 00:07:43,924
- Yes.
- That's a trade secret.

129
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:48,401
I'll give you a hint. It involved
bribing the tower electrician.

130
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:49,555
How much?

131
00:07:49,634 --> 00:07:50,635
50 bucks.

132
00:07:50,914 --> 00:07:52,803
- But it's so hard.
- Oh, thank you.

133
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:53,995
Is it always a seven?

134
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,678
I could do that trick 52 different ways.

135
00:07:55,754 --> 00:07:57,643
Can you do 52 different tricks on me?

136
00:07:58,074 --> 00:07:59,155
I'll see what I can do.

137
00:07:59,434 --> 00:08:01,118
Magic man!

138
00:08:01,474 --> 00:08:02,885
I love your shampoo.

139
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,434
- Hold up.
- What?

140
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:09,881
You need to leave.

141
00:08:09,954 --> 00:08:10,955
Are you kidding me?

142
00:08:11,154 --> 00:08:13,156
Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing.

143
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:14,395
Is this what you do?

144
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:16,442
Some kind of sick trick you do to women?

145
00:08:16,634 --> 00:08:18,762
"45 East Evan Street."

146
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:20,325
Don't worry about it. I'll call you.

147
00:08:20,514 --> 00:08:21,925
You don't have my number.

148
00:08:22,114 --> 00:08:24,162
I'm magic. I'll find it. Have a good night.

149
00:08:24,234 --> 00:08:25,759
You are such an asshole.

150
00:09:38,314 --> 00:09:39,361
Hey!

151
00:09:40,474 --> 00:09:41,521
Henley.

152
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:43,922
<i>Danny'? He'!-</i>

153
00:09:44,314 --> 00:09:46,794
You got a card, huh?

154
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,995
No,no,no,
it's good for you. Congratulations.

155
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:51,075
All right, so here's what I'm gonna do,

156
00:09:51,194 --> 00:09:52,480
I'm gonna go inside.
I'm gonna scope the place out.

157
00:09:52,554 --> 00:09:53,760
You wait out here. I will come back

158
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:54,915
and get you, okay? Do not come in.

159
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,758
Hey, Danny! I'm not your assistant anymore.

160
00:09:57,034 --> 00:09:58,365
Nice hair.

161
00:09:58,434 --> 00:10:00,163
So, actually, what have you been up to?

162
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:02,362
I think you know exactly
what I've been up to, Danny.

163
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:05,199
I saw all your anonymous
posting on my website.

164
00:10:05,274 --> 00:10:06,514
You have a website. That's good.

165
00:10:06,594 --> 00:10:08,358
Good for you. Get the word out.

166
00:10:10,874 --> 00:10:12,319
Okay.

167
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:15,557
So apparently none of us
was the only one chosen.

168
00:10:15,674 --> 00:10:18,280
Let me be the first one
to kick my ego to the curb.

169
00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:19,515
Yeah. Excuse me.

170
00:10:19,594 --> 00:10:21,403
- Door's locked.
- Is it? I'll check.

171
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,080
You. Now, hold it, don't tell me.

172
00:10:24,194 --> 00:10:25,764
Helen? No, no.

173
00:10:25,914 --> 00:10:27,279
Henley.

174
00:10:27,354 --> 00:10:28,594
It's on your coffee cup.

175
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,478
Thanks for keeping me honest.

176
00:10:30,554 --> 00:10:32,079
That wasn't mentalism, by the way.

177
00:10:32,194 --> 00:10:33,275
It was just an observation.

178
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:36,961
Second observation, you are beautiful.

179
00:10:37,394 --> 00:10:38,156
Thank you.

180
00:10:38,474 --> 00:10:40,954
That's good. That's very nice.
Very well-polished. Nice bit.

181
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:43,321
J. Daniel Atlas. Nice to meet you.

182
00:10:43,554 --> 00:10:45,204
Very nice. I know
who you are and I just want to say that

183
00:10:45,314 --> 00:10:46,281
I'm not interested in you doing

184
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,515
your mentalism thing on us.

185
00:10:47,754 --> 00:10:50,280
Especially when we don't know
who brought us here or even if it's real.

186
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:55,119
Hold on, I'm sensing...
I'm sensing you are a control freak.

187
00:10:55,194 --> 00:10:56,434
I'm sorry, have we met before?

188
00:10:56,514 --> 00:10:57,959
It doesn't take a mentalist to figure that out.

189
00:10:58,034 --> 00:10:59,115
You are a control freak.

190
00:10:59,194 --> 00:11:01,276
Well, I take that as a compliment.

191
00:11:01,354 --> 00:11:02,765
Only he would take it as a compliment.

192
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:04,836
Okay, great. Good. Another compliment.

193
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:08,282
Okay. So that's why
you're no longer a couple.

194
00:11:08,354 --> 00:11:09,480
A couple? No, no.

195
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:10,760
We were never a couple.

196
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:12,643
He used to saw me in half.

197
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:13,761
She was a very good assistant.

198
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:14,881
But I was too fat for Danny.

199
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:17,798
No. I said that one time
because of the trap door.

200
00:11:17,874 --> 00:11:19,876
- There were specs.
- You built it this size.

201
00:11:19,954 --> 00:11:21,479
No one could fit through there. No one.

202
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:22,715
Rebecca fit through.

203
00:11:22,874 --> 00:11:24,478
Rebecca fit for years.

204
00:11:24,554 --> 00:11:26,238
Do you know how hard it is to stay

205
00:11:26,354 --> 00:11:28,197
in those tiny little costumes?

206
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:30,237
No. I'm the main attraction.

207
00:11:30,514 --> 00:11:32,482
Okay. So he never made you feel special.

208
00:11:32,554 --> 00:11:36,479
And, trust me, you deserve
to be made to feel special.

209
00:11:36,554 --> 00:11:37,999
That's a really nice story.

210
00:11:38,074 --> 00:11:39,758
Hope you guys enjoy each other's company.

211
00:11:39,994 --> 00:11:41,155
No way.

212
00:11:42,314 --> 00:11:43,918
J. Daniel Atlas?

213
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:46,640
Dude, I've seen everything
that you have ever done.

214
00:11:46,714 --> 00:11:48,000
You're like...

215
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,314
I idolize you. Seriously.

216
00:11:49,394 --> 00:11:50,919
From a true fan. It's so nice to meet you.

217
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:52,519
I'm Jack, by the way.

218
00:11:52,594 --> 00:11:54,005
Question. Did you get one of these?

219
00:11:55,034 --> 00:11:55,921
Yeah. Death.

220
00:11:56,794 --> 00:11:57,955
The High Priestess.

221
00:11:58,114 --> 00:11:59,320
I'm the Lover.

222
00:11:59,474 --> 00:12:00,521
Three minutes.

223
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:02,595
Hermit.

224
00:12:02,794 --> 00:12:05,445
So, what are we...
Are we waiting for someone?

225
00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:07,079
- Why are we just...
- The door's locked.

226
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:09,680
Oh, no, nothing's ever locked.

227
00:12:19,354 --> 00:12:21,163
What is this place?

228
00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:27,124
Wow. Thought my apartment was nasty.

229
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:36,956
Man, it's freezing in here.

230
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:39,681
What's that?

231
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:41,080
I don't know.

232
00:12:44,354 --> 00:12:45,355
What's it say?

233
00:12:46,594 --> 00:12:48,164
"Now you don't."

234
00:12:48,954 --> 00:12:52,276
"A rose by any other name..."

235
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:59,401
Guys, what's happening?

236
00:13:01,074 --> 00:13:02,599
Look at that.

237
00:13:09,314 --> 00:13:10,440
It's gag!

238
00:13:10,674 --> 00:13:12,756
Relax. Just dry ice.

239
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:14,555
Cool.

240
00:13:15,514 --> 00:13:17,004
Wait. What do you think this is all about?

241
00:13:17,074 --> 00:13:18,838
Hang on. Hang on.

242
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:24,835
I got nothin'.

243
00:13:24,994 --> 00:13:26,758
Okay. Thank you. Thank you for the delay.

244
00:13:26,954 --> 00:13:28,956
I'm just trying to create
the space for wisdom.

245
00:13:29,034 --> 00:13:30,604
Okay, so you're like Buddha,

246
00:13:30,674 --> 00:13:32,119
if he wasn't so enlightened.

247
00:13:32,194 --> 00:13:33,559
And you're like Jesus,

248
00:13:33,634 --> 00:13:36,205
if he was arrogant
and all of his miracles were fake.

249
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,560
Okay, lovebirds, get a room.

250
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:39,477
Danny, be honest. Did you do this?

251
00:13:39,554 --> 00:13:40,680
No. Wait, did you?

252
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,120
I Wish.

253
00:13:42,594 --> 00:13:44,881
Why didn't anyone ask me if I did it?

254
00:13:45,874 --> 00:13:47,035
Oh, great.

255
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:54,158
Electricity is out.

256
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:56,803
Well, let's check.

257
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:15,124
Blueprints.

258
00:14:15,914 --> 00:14:17,325
They're incredible.

259
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:20,119
Who do you think did this?

260
00:14:20,274 --> 00:14:22,436
I don't know, but I really want to meet them.

261
00:14:24,394 --> 00:14:25,964
It's a show.

262
00:14:45,794 --> 00:14:47,239

263
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,319

268
00:15:07,634 --> 00:15:09,079
Thank you.

269
00:15:09,154 --> 00:15:11,316
Tonight we would like to try something

270
00:15:11,434 --> 00:15:13,960
that will, well, set us a bit apart.

271
00:15:14,034 --> 00:15:15,559
For our final trick,

272
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:17,602
we're gonna do something never before

273
00:15:17,674 --> 00:15:19,676
seen on a Las Vegas stage.

274
00:15:20,714 --> 00:15:23,035
Or any stage for that matter.

275
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:25,677
Ladies and gentlemen,

276
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:28,715
tonight

277
00:15:29,634 --> 00:15:31,762
we are going to rob a bank.

278
00:15:42,354 --> 00:15:44,482
That's a lot of excitement for a crime.

279
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,880
I'm getting excited.
What about you, people?

280
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,595
One, two, three!

281
00:16:05,274 --> 00:16:07,197
Sorry, sir.
There's absolutely no recording allowed

282
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:08,554
during the performance.

283
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,636
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, of course.

284
00:16:10,714 --> 00:16:11,795
Let me just put this away.

285
00:16:11,874 --> 00:16:13,205
Actually, I need to take that.

286
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:15,720
After the show, I can come
and give it back to you.

287
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,799
Okay.

288
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,643
Okay, Okay-

289
00:16:22,874 --> 00:16:24,717
Now, please, please, settle down.

290
00:16:25,474 --> 00:16:28,318
Now who here has a bank
they would like us to rob?

291
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:31,556
That's a lot of people with a vendetta.

292
00:16:31,754 --> 00:16:33,438
So we'll choose one at random then.

293
00:16:35,074 --> 00:16:37,725
My associates will make sure
it's random. Right?

294
00:16:38,634 --> 00:16:40,955
- Elvis, help me out, bud.
- Thank you very much.

295
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:43,725
In Jack's bowl
are ping pong balls with section numbers.

296
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,796
Jack, could you hand me a section number?

297
00:16:45,994 --> 00:16:47,484
Thank you. We are looking at Section B.

298
00:16:47,554 --> 00:16:48,715
Where is Section B?

299
00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:51,874
Okay. There. It's gonna be
one of you guys. Get ready.

300
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:53,725
I don't know why everybody's happy.

301
00:16:53,794 --> 00:16:54,841
It's only them.

302
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,718
Merritt, can I get a row, please?

303
00:16:57,594 --> 00:16:58,675
Thank you, Merritt.

304
00:16:58,754 --> 00:17:00,563
We are looking at row number 5.

305
00:17:00,634 --> 00:17:01,760
Where is that?

306
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:04,678
And Henley, could I please
have a random seat number?

307
00:17:05,554 --> 00:17:07,124
Oh. Lucky number 13.

308
00:17:07,354 --> 00:17:08,879
B-5-13. Where are you?

309
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,835
Sir, please, stand up. There you are. Hi.

310
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,084
Could you just confirm for me that this

311
00:17:16,154 --> 00:17:18,202
is, in fact, your seat? B-5-13.

312
00:17:18,274 --> 00:17:19,275
Yes.

313
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:21,356
Okay. Wonderful.
Now, could you please tell us

314
00:17:21,434 --> 00:17:22,799
your name and the name of your bank?

315
00:17:22,994 --> 00:17:25,201
Well, my name is Etienne Forcier.

316
00:17:25,474 --> 00:17:28,796
And my bank,
it's Credit Republicain de Paris.

317
00:17:28,994 --> 00:17:30,155
French. Okay.

318
00:17:30,394 --> 00:17:31,919
We were hoping for something
a little more local,

319
00:17:31,994 --> 00:17:34,281
a kind of mom-and-pop
credit union with no security.

320
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,402
But that's fine. A promise is a promise.

321
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:37,714
Could you please come up to the stage

322
00:17:37,794 --> 00:17:39,034
and we'll rob your bank.

323
00:17:39,154 --> 00:17:41,282
And while he does that...

324
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:42,640
There is someone here tonight

325
00:17:42,714 --> 00:17:44,478
without whom we would just be

326
00:17:44,554 --> 00:17:46,556
four magicians working the circuit,

327
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:47,635
trying to get--...

328
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,245
Well, actually, trying to get here.

329
00:17:49,474 --> 00:17:50,600
You probably know this man,

330
00:17:50,674 --> 00:17:52,199
if not from one of the many, many

331
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:53,554
companies he puts his name on.

332
00:17:53,634 --> 00:17:55,762
He is our friend. He is our benefactor.

333
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:57,165
Mr. Arthur Tressler.

334
00:17:57,234 --> 00:17:59,316
Please, stand up, Art. Please, stand up.

335
00:17:59,394 --> 00:18:00,395
The only man here with

336
00:18:00,474 --> 00:18:02,636
the Queen's cell phone number.

337
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:05,156
Actually, please, stay standing, Art.

338
00:18:06,154 --> 00:18:08,441
I want to say that
when we came to Mr. Tressler,

339
00:18:08,514 --> 00:18:10,881
we promised that, as a unit,
we could become

340
00:18:10,994 --> 00:18:12,075
the biggest name in magic.

341
00:18:12,154 --> 00:18:13,599
So we wanted to say, "Thank you."

342
00:18:13,674 --> 00:18:15,676
And by the way, Art,
you notice on the sign out front,

343
00:18:15,754 --> 00:18:17,836
we made sure we put your name on top.

344
00:18:17,994 --> 00:18:20,076
If you turn out to be as good

345
00:18:20,194 --> 00:18:22,003
as you think you are, dear girl,

346
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:24,276
that won't be necessary much longer.

347
00:18:24,514 --> 00:18:25,754
We haven't done our closer yet.

348
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:27,040
Why don't you watch it

349
00:18:27,114 --> 00:18:28,445
and then you can decide for yourself.

350
00:18:28,514 --> 00:18:30,994
Ladies and gentlemen, Arthur Tressler!

351
00:18:31,074 --> 00:18:32,439
Thank you. And, of course, once again,

352
00:18:32,514 --> 00:18:34,562
the Cardinal of Clairvoyance,
Merritt McKinney.

353
00:18:34,794 --> 00:18:38,037
Etienne, what Jack
is bringing to the stage now,

354
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:41,875
is what we in the magic world
call a teleportation helmet.

355
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:44,116
You will need to wear this,
as it will allow you

356
00:18:44,354 --> 00:18:48,120
to literally fold through space and time

357
00:18:48,354 --> 00:18:50,561
to your bank in the...

358
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:51,761
8th?

359
00:18:51,954 --> 00:18:53,877
-9th arrondissement.
- Yeah.

360
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:55,877
Now, once you are there,

361
00:18:55,954 --> 00:18:58,036
we will be able to speak
with you through this helmet.

362
00:18:58,114 --> 00:18:59,878
NOW if...

363
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:01,838
Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

364
00:19:01,914 --> 00:19:04,155
It has the added attraction
of being very stylish.

365
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:07,995
It's about time the French learned
from America on that subject.

366
00:19:09,594 --> 00:19:10,720
Is that a beautiful piece of headgear?

367
00:19:10,794 --> 00:19:12,398
- Thank you. Thank you...
-it is.

368
00:19:13,474 --> 00:19:16,080
Thank you. Thank you very much.

369
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:18,799
But before you go anywhere,

370
00:19:18,914 --> 00:19:20,916
could you please, pick a card, any card.

371
00:19:21,114 --> 00:19:22,240
Not that card.

372
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:25,756
No, that's an old American joke.
You can take that one.

373
00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:27,399
Okay. This one?

374
00:19:27,594 --> 00:19:29,596
Show it to your friends in Section B.
But not to us.

375
00:19:31,234 --> 00:19:33,282
Okay, great. Now if you could
just sign your name there.

376
00:19:33,434 --> 00:19:35,835
- Yes.
- In English, if possible.

377
00:19:36,234 --> 00:19:37,679
- That's good.
- Thanks.

378
00:19:38,794 --> 00:19:39,920
Put it in your pocket.

379
00:19:40,274 --> 00:19:42,675
And now for one tiny detail.

380
00:20:00,114 --> 00:20:04,676
Now, Etienne, let's step into
this cockamamie contraption.

381
00:20:04,874 --> 00:20:07,115
<i>And I'll step off of it. Bonne chance.</i>

382
00:20:07,194 --> 00:20:09,959
It's 11:50 p.m. here in Vegas.

383
00:20:10,154 --> 00:20:12,282
That's 8:50 a.m. in Paris.

384
00:20:12,474 --> 00:20:14,841
Your bank opens in less than 10 minutes.

385
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:16,035
One,

386
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,195
two...

387
00:20:17,274 --> 00:20:18,355
Three.

388
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:22,795
What the fuck?

389
00:20:22,994 --> 00:20:24,644
- Efienne?
- Efienne?

390
00:20:24,794 --> 00:20:26,762
It wasn't supposed to happen
like that, was it?

391
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:28,120
Efienne?

392
00:20:28,474 --> 00:20:30,476
I liked that little French guy.

393
00:20:30,674 --> 00:20:31,721
Where did he go?

394
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:42,244
Wait, there he is.

395
00:20:44,514 --> 00:20:46,562
No, no, no, no, please, please, please.

396
00:20:46,834 --> 00:20:49,485
This is Daniel Atlas. Can you hear me?

397
00:20:49,594 --> 00:20:50,834
Etienne? Are you okay?

398
00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:51,995
<i>Yes.</i>

399
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:54,475
Perfect. What do you see in there?

400
00:20:56,434 --> 00:20:57,515
Money.

401
00:20:57,994 --> 00:20:59,120
Is this real?

402
00:20:59,194 --> 00:21:01,720
Yes. Looks like three million
or so Euros' worth.

403
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:05,518
Okay, now, here's what
we're gonna need you to do.

404
00:21:05,594 --> 00:21:07,562
<i>I want you to take the card that you signed</i>

405
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:08,874
<i>out of your pocket.</i>

406
00:21:09,354 --> 00:21:10,435
And I want you to take the ticket stub

407
00:21:10,514 --> 00:21:11,561
from tonight's show

408
00:21:11,754 --> 00:21:12,801
<i>and I want you to put it right there</i>

409
00:21:12,874 --> 00:21:14,956
<i>in the middle of the money.</i>

410
00:21:18,034 --> 00:21:19,195
Now drop it.

411
00:21:31,234 --> 00:21:34,477
Now, on the side of your helmet
you should feel a button.

412
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:35,885
Don't press it just yet.

413
00:21:35,954 --> 00:21:37,718
<i>That button activates an air duct</i>

414
00:21:37,794 --> 00:21:40,559
that connects Paris to Las Vegas.

415
00:21:40,714 --> 00:21:42,045
<i>Okay, good. Now you can press it.</i>

416
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,396
All right, now, Etienne, hold on tight.

417
00:21:44,474 --> 00:21:45,839
You might feel a bit of a vacuum.

418
00:22:16,914 --> 00:22:18,279
Wait a second.

419
00:23:11,994 --> 00:23:14,281
Thank you, Etienne. Thank you, everyone!

420
00:23:14,354 --> 00:23:15,515
We are The Four Horsemen.

421
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:16,720
And good night!

422
00:23:16,794 --> 00:23:18,398
Good night!

423
00:23:30,754 --> 00:23:31,960
Hold up here.

424
00:23:32,314 --> 00:23:33,918
Dylan Rhodes.

425
00:23:35,394 --> 00:23:37,556
What? I don't think I heard you correctly.

426
00:23:37,634 --> 00:23:39,079
Did you say magicians?

427
00:23:39,154 --> 00:23:41,077
Yeah, Dylan, magicians.

428
00:23:41,154 --> 00:23:42,360
<i>Where are you now?</i>

429
00:23:42,474 --> 00:23:44,476
I'm at Aria. I'm heading
up there to grab 'em now.

430
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:50,597
FBI! Hands where I can see them.

431
00:23:50,674 --> 00:23:52,039
Let's go. Get 'em up. Come on.

432
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:55,163
Let's go. Get 'em up.

433
00:23:55,354 --> 00:23:56,640
Put the book down.

434
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:58,598
Okay. You got me.

435
00:23:58,674 --> 00:24:00,199
- Freeze! Hands in the air!
- Oh, my!

436
00:24:00,674 --> 00:24:03,439
Do one of you guys
mind giving us a hand with our bags?

437
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:05,041
Let's go.

438
00:24:22,874 --> 00:24:24,842
<i>Boss, please tell me this is a joke.</i>

439
00:24:24,914 --> 00:24:27,963
<i>I just got Willy Mears
to finger Paulie Attanasio.</i>

440
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:29,763
I'm a month, two tops,

441
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:31,324
away from blowing this whole thing open.

442
00:24:31,394 --> 00:24:32,441
Get Turkelson.

443
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:33,640
He's in Atlantic City.

444
00:24:33,714 --> 00:24:34,954
What about Cowan? Look at him.

445
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:36,479
He's just sitting there on his ass.

446
00:24:36,554 --> 00:24:37,760
Hilarious, Rhodes.

447
00:24:38,234 --> 00:24:39,360
I love you.

448
00:24:39,674 --> 00:24:40,721
Asshole.

449
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:42,484
I don't have time for this magic crap.

450
00:24:42,554 --> 00:24:45,125
This crap just pulled
three million Euro out of a Parisian bank.

451
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:46,355
- That's how much they got?
- Yeah.

452
00:24:46,434 --> 00:24:47,959
Actually, 3.2.

453
00:24:51,594 --> 00:24:52,595
Who is she?

454
00:24:53,594 --> 00:24:54,595
Who are you?

455
00:24:54,714 --> 00:24:56,364
Alma Dray from Interpol.

456
00:24:56,514 --> 00:24:58,004
I'll be working the investigation with you.

457
00:24:58,074 --> 00:24:59,280
You gotta be kidding me.

458
00:24:59,354 --> 00:25:00,924
It's bad enough they got me chasing down

459
00:25:01,034 --> 00:25:02,160
David Copperfield and Friends.

460
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:05,477
Now I'm being saddled with,
no offense, with Interpol?

461
00:25:05,554 --> 00:25:07,795
I look forward to working
with you, too, Agent Rhodes.

462
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:10,844
I'm sorry. I don't think I'm gonna
need your help on this. Okay?

463
00:25:10,914 --> 00:25:13,485
- Where's the French guy?
- I already spoke to him.

464
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,080
Oh, you did? You spoke
to my witness before me?

465
00:25:16,194 --> 00:25:19,323
Your witness? I thought
you didn't want the case.

466
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:20,919
Besides, he's useless.

467
00:25:21,194 --> 00:25:22,798
Oh, really? Why is that?

468
00:25:22,874 --> 00:25:25,161
Because he believes their magic was real.

469
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:26,918
Oh, he believes the magic was real?

470
00:25:26,994 --> 00:25:28,439
You're right, he probably is useless.

471
00:25:28,514 --> 00:25:31,882
Is it okay with Interpol if we talk to him, too?

472
00:25:31,954 --> 00:25:33,524
Thank you.

473
00:25:34,154 --> 00:25:37,317
I have never stolen a thing in my life, okay?

474
00:25:37,394 --> 00:25:39,795
I tried to give
the money back, but they won't take it.

475
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:42,320
Okay, okay, okay,
let's just say you robbed a bank.

476
00:25:42,394 --> 00:25:44,965
- I did.
- Fine. Fantastic. You did.

477
00:25:45,034 --> 00:25:47,605
But since I'm new to this,
can you explain to me how you went

478
00:25:47,674 --> 00:25:50,075
from Las Vegas to Paris in three seconds?

479
00:25:50,554 --> 00:25:52,318
With the teleportation helmet.

480
00:25:52,754 --> 00:25:54,438
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

481
00:25:54,514 --> 00:25:56,403
He was hypnotized during the show.

482
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:58,317
I told you, he's useless.

483
00:25:58,394 --> 00:25:59,520
Okay, I'll deal with you when I'm done

484
00:25:59,594 --> 00:26:01,164
with this other bullshit.

485
00:26:04,714 --> 00:26:05,681
Hey!

486
00:26:05,754 --> 00:26:07,438
During the show,
half the audience was hypnotized

487
00:26:07,514 --> 00:26:08,800
to believe they were in the Philharmonic.

488
00:26:08,914 --> 00:26:11,201
I guess that "bullshit" was the trigger word.

489
00:26:11,274 --> 00:26:14,756
Okay. Hey, hey. Ecoutez.
Etienne, come on down from there.

490
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:16,120
You're not in the Philharmonic.

491
00:26:16,194 --> 00:26:18,595
- How do you say "stop" in French?
- Stop.

492
00:26:18,714 --> 00:26:19,761
Tell him to stop.

493
00:26:19,834 --> 00:26:24,078
No, I can't. You just have to
let him finish his movement.

494
00:26:24,394 --> 00:26:26,237
Okay, I need a time-out.

495
00:26:26,314 --> 00:26:27,839
Too many French people in one room.

496
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:29,479
Agent Rhodes!

497
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:32,239
I'm ordered by my bosses
to provide a report.

498
00:26:32,354 --> 00:26:35,403
And until we have one,
I'm here, like it or not.

499
00:26:35,474 --> 00:26:37,044
So we can work together,

500
00:26:37,234 --> 00:26:39,123
or you can continue to follow behind

501
00:26:39,234 --> 00:26:41,362
asking the same exact questions I'm asking.

502
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,635
It's up to you.

503
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:47,885
I'm not finished.

504
00:26:47,994 --> 00:26:51,760
I just flew 12 hours,
after what was already a long day.

505
00:26:51,874 --> 00:26:54,195
And I do not handle jet lag well.

506
00:26:57,314 --> 00:26:59,715
So if you want to see who can be grumpier,

507
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:01,916
I promise you, you will lose.

508
00:27:03,514 --> 00:27:05,642
Fine. So which one of these idiots

509
00:27:05,714 --> 00:27:07,125
do you want to talk to first?

510
00:27:07,194 --> 00:27:08,241
Him?

511
00:27:13,794 --> 00:27:14,920
Dylan, for the record,

512
00:27:14,994 --> 00:27:17,122
mentalism has never actually
been proven to be accurate.

513
00:27:17,194 --> 00:27:18,275
Okay.

514
00:27:18,354 --> 00:27:19,685
That is to say, that it's not a science.

515
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:21,074
It's more for entertainment.

516
00:27:21,194 --> 00:27:22,434
All right.

517
00:27:22,514 --> 00:27:25,882
Just don't believe
everything the guy says. That's all.

518
00:27:26,834 --> 00:27:29,678
Please convey my deepest apologies

519
00:27:29,794 --> 00:27:31,558
to your colleague out there.

520
00:27:31,634 --> 00:27:34,035
I'm really sorry about this
whole Tranny Tuesday thing.

521
00:27:34,114 --> 00:27:35,275
I was out of line.

522
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:36,594
Tranny Tuesday?

523
00:27:36,674 --> 00:27:38,358
Well, it's an arrangement
he and his wife have.

524
00:27:38,474 --> 00:27:40,203
Or might not have, if you believe

525
00:27:40,314 --> 00:27:42,760
everything Agent Fuller
is saying to be correct.

526
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:45,440
But isn't there a proud tradition in the FBI

527
00:27:45,514 --> 00:27:47,403
of men wearing dresses?

528
00:27:48,114 --> 00:27:51,835
<i>No shame, Agent Fuller. No shame.</i>

529
00:27:54,914 --> 00:27:56,518
I'm just having fun.

530
00:27:56,594 --> 00:27:58,915
Was this your card? No.

531
00:27:58,994 --> 00:28:00,325
See, I knew you weren't
a queen of hearts lady,

532
00:28:00,394 --> 00:28:01,395
and I respect that.

533
00:28:01,474 --> 00:28:03,363
The trick usually works better
when I'm not strapped in here,

534
00:28:03,434 --> 00:28:04,481
but I understand protocol.

535
00:28:04,554 --> 00:28:05,885
Okay, Okay-

536
00:28:05,954 --> 00:28:08,560
So, if you had nothing to do with it,

537
00:28:08,634 --> 00:28:11,240
then how did
the playing card get into the vault?

538
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,315
Oh, yes. That would be...

539
00:28:12,394 --> 00:28:13,919
What do the kids call it these days?

540
00:28:14,034 --> 00:28:15,160
Oh, yes, that's right. Magic.

541
00:28:15,234 --> 00:28:17,236
Just answer the question, okay, smartass.

542
00:28:17,314 --> 00:28:19,920
All right. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

543
00:28:20,914 --> 00:28:22,882
You can keep that. Don't share it with him.

544
00:28:23,074 --> 00:28:26,078
It says here you are a mentalist.

545
00:28:26,714 --> 00:28:29,320
What exactly is mentalism?

546
00:28:29,394 --> 00:28:32,364
Tricks, mostly. Some science.

547
00:28:32,594 --> 00:28:36,440
Targeted guessing
might be a most apt description.

548
00:28:36,594 --> 00:28:39,837
Along with some intuition
and the occasional...

549
00:28:41,514 --> 00:28:43,198
Voices in my head.

550
00:28:44,434 --> 00:28:47,438
Says here you were
fairly famous at one point.

551
00:28:47,514 --> 00:28:49,516
You can
even hypnotize people over the phone.

552
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:52,120
Some big tours
around the U.S. for a few years,

553
00:28:52,194 --> 00:28:54,196
-two TV specials.
- Glory days.

554
00:28:54,394 --> 00:28:57,876
Then your brother/manager disappeared
with all your hard-earned money.

555
00:28:57,954 --> 00:28:59,285
Did your research, did you?

556
00:28:59,354 --> 00:29:01,197
IRS audit. Back taxes.

557
00:29:01,274 --> 00:29:03,038
You've had a long hard slog back

558
00:29:03,114 --> 00:29:05,515
into the limelight,
haven't you, Mr. McKinney?

559
00:29:05,594 --> 00:29:10,282
Yes, indeed, it has. And I do appreciate
that trip down Memory Lane.

560
00:29:10,474 --> 00:29:12,442
As far as I understand it,
when the man from Paris

561
00:29:12,554 --> 00:29:13,715
put on the magical helmet...

562
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:14,795
Listen to me.

563
00:29:14,914 --> 00:29:17,485
If you didn't rob that bank,
then you knew about it.

564
00:29:17,554 --> 00:29:18,680
Which makes you an accomplice.

565
00:29:18,754 --> 00:29:21,155
So if you wanna walk out of here
today, I'd suggest you start...

566
00:29:21,274 --> 00:29:22,321
Now you listen to me, unless you think

567
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:23,805
there's a D.A. in the state of Nevada

568
00:29:23,874 --> 00:29:25,364
who'd be willing
to make sense of this to a jury,

569
00:29:25,434 --> 00:29:26,595
then we have a show to perform.

570
00:29:26,794 --> 00:29:27,841
And you, Agent Rhodes,

571
00:29:27,914 --> 00:29:29,279
have a drawing board to get back to.

572
00:29:29,354 --> 00:29:30,799
Is this your first date?

573
00:29:31,874 --> 00:29:33,035
What?

574
00:29:33,114 --> 00:29:36,914
No, I mean, obviously, you guys don't
know each other well, if at all.

575
00:29:36,994 --> 00:29:40,476
But, like,
there is a palpable tension in this room.

576
00:29:40,554 --> 00:29:42,397
And before you get involved,

577
00:29:42,474 --> 00:29:46,001
you should consider the fact
that she has a lot of big secrets.

578
00:29:46,114 --> 00:29:47,798
And I know the first one is that

579
00:29:47,874 --> 00:29:51,003
this is your first time off the desk. Isn't it?

580
00:29:51,394 --> 00:29:52,884
You should have said something to him.

581
00:29:52,954 --> 00:29:55,116
This is a weird way for you to find out.

582
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:57,037
You are literally
begging to be arrested. You know that?

583
00:29:57,154 --> 00:29:59,521
If it means you would
actually do it, then, yeah. But you won't.

584
00:29:59,594 --> 00:30:01,039
Because if you did, it means that you,

585
00:30:01,114 --> 00:30:03,196
and the FBI, and your friends at Interpol,

586
00:30:03,314 --> 00:30:06,761
actually believe,
at an institutional level, in magic.

587
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:09,484
The press would have a field day.

588
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,483
And we'd be even more famous
than we already are.

589
00:30:11,554 --> 00:30:12,794
And you guys would look like idiots

590
00:30:12,874 --> 00:30:14,205
even more then you already are.

591
00:30:14,274 --> 00:30:17,756
Well, no, not you. But him. Right?

592
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:19,518
You have,
what we in the business, like to call,

593
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:21,039
"nothing up your sleeve."

594
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,275
And you know it.

595
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,436
Don't draw him in and then dump him

596
00:30:24,594 --> 00:30:27,996
because abandonment
is a big "area" for him.

597
00:30:28,514 --> 00:30:29,675
Mommy?

598
00:30:30,354 --> 00:30:31,594
Daddy.

599
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:33,359
You have big daddy issues.

600
00:30:33,434 --> 00:30:35,004
<i>- Okay, that's enough.
- I'll tell you what.</i>

601
00:30:35,074 --> 00:30:38,362
Your average therapist is gonna charge you
$200-$300 for this sesh.

602
00:30:38,474 --> 00:30:40,761
Me? I'll take a tenner.

603
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:44,403
Okay, later, if you're feeling magnanimous,

604
00:30:44,474 --> 00:30:46,397
I'll still take a tenner.

605
00:30:46,634 --> 00:30:48,682
You wanna know who sat
in that chair before you?

606
00:30:48,794 --> 00:30:50,876
Mob bosses, murderers, and thieves.

607
00:30:51,074 --> 00:30:52,519
And you know who put them there?

608
00:30:52,594 --> 00:30:54,517
The guy who's sitting in this chair.

609
00:30:54,594 --> 00:30:58,565
So I warn you,
I can maintain my resolve much longer

610
00:30:58,634 --> 00:31:01,478
than you can maintain
that phony arrogance.

611
00:31:01,554 --> 00:31:03,682
And the instant that you even show

612
00:31:03,754 --> 00:31:06,439
the slightest crack in that smug facade,

613
00:31:06,514 --> 00:31:07,845
I'll be there.

614
00:31:07,914 --> 00:31:09,484
I will be all over you like...

615
00:31:09,554 --> 00:31:10,760
Like white on rice?

616
00:31:11,034 --> 00:31:12,524
Sorry. That's unfair.

617
00:31:12,714 --> 00:31:13,715
Let me warn you.

618
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:14,921
I want you to follow.

619
00:31:15,114 --> 00:31:16,445
Because no matter
what you think you might know,

620
00:31:16,554 --> 00:31:18,079
we will always be one step, three steps,

621
00:31:18,154 --> 00:31:19,201
seven steps ahead of you.

622
00:31:19,274 --> 00:31:20,514
And just when you think you're catching up,

623
00:31:20,594 --> 00:31:21,959
that's when we'll be right behind you.

624
00:31:22,034 --> 00:31:23,524
And at no time will you be
anywhere other than

625
00:31:23,594 --> 00:31:24,675
exactly where I want you to be.

626
00:31:24,754 --> 00:31:26,404
So come close. Get all over me

627
00:31:26,474 --> 00:31:27,805
because the closer you think you are,

628
00:31:27,874 --> 00:31:29,285
the less you'll actually see.

629
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:30,355
I'm gonna nail you...

630
00:31:34,794 --> 00:31:37,161
Something wrong with that soda, Miss?

631
00:31:45,434 --> 00:31:46,674
Oh! Shit!

632
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:48,799
First rule of magic.

633
00:31:49,594 --> 00:31:51,881
Always be the smartest guy in the room.

634
00:32:14,954 --> 00:32:16,843
Boss, what are we doing?
We're letting them go?

635
00:32:17,074 --> 00:32:19,122
They all but admitted
they're gonna do it again.

636
00:32:19,194 --> 00:32:21,242
About a half an hour ago,
you didn't give a damn about them.

637
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,078
- What changed?
- I met them.

638
00:32:23,154 --> 00:32:24,155
Hey. Guys.

639
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:26,954
Hey, I ran a check on the audience.

640
00:32:27,034 --> 00:32:28,160
Most of it was just filler.

641
00:32:28,234 --> 00:32:29,918
People that Tressler
dragged in to pack the room.

642
00:32:29,994 --> 00:32:31,803
But guess who was sitting there in the back,

643
00:32:31,874 --> 00:32:33,035
filming the whole damn thing?

644
00:32:33,154 --> 00:32:34,155
I don't know.

645
00:32:34,234 --> 00:32:35,724
Thaddeus Bradley.

646
00:32:38,234 --> 00:32:40,396
Thaddeus Bradley,
the guy from TV with the DVDs and shows?

647
00:32:40,514 --> 00:32:41,515
No.

648
00:32:41,594 --> 00:32:43,915
Okay, well, he debunks magicians.

649
00:32:43,994 --> 00:32:45,837
He exposes them.
He shows you how to do their tricks.

650
00:32:45,914 --> 00:32:46,995
Get him on the phone.

651
00:32:47,074 --> 00:32:48,758
I did. You're having lunch with him in 45.

652
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:49,881
Good.

653
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,719
<i>Mr. Bradley started as a magician.</i>

654
00:32:52,794 --> 00:32:54,523
- He was actually quite good.
- Really?

655
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:56,962
- One of the best.
- You don't say.

656
00:32:58,314 --> 00:33:01,204
"The greatest genius
is in seeing through the illusion."

657
00:33:01,274 --> 00:33:03,675
That's a man who loves his work.

658
00:33:05,154 --> 00:33:06,963
You sure I can't interest you
in a glass of wine?

659
00:33:07,034 --> 00:33:09,878
No, no, no. No, thank you, sir.
We're working.

660
00:33:10,314 --> 00:33:11,475
I will take one.

661
00:33:20,034 --> 00:33:22,605
That's incredible. That's amazing.

662
00:33:24,194 --> 00:33:25,355
Red dye, palmed.

663
00:33:25,474 --> 00:33:28,125
Is that how Jesus did it? That's incredible.

664
00:33:28,194 --> 00:33:29,559
I'm sorry. Can I just take a minute here?

665
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:31,921
You were one of the great magicians.
Why did you stop?

666
00:33:32,554 --> 00:33:35,239
Do you know how many people went
to see magic performed live

667
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:36,884
in the last half decade?

668
00:33:36,954 --> 00:33:38,240
About 1.6 million.

669
00:33:38,314 --> 00:33:41,636
You know how many DVDs I sold
in the same period?

670
00:33:41,714 --> 00:33:43,045
Five million.

671
00:33:43,114 --> 00:33:44,161
Right, so it's about the money.

672
00:33:44,234 --> 00:33:45,724
Well, the money is only there

673
00:33:45,794 --> 00:33:49,082
because the need to know
is greater than the desire to be fooled.

674
00:33:49,154 --> 00:33:53,443
Like you, I detest those
who prey upon the gullibility of the masses.

675
00:33:53,514 --> 00:33:57,200
With all due respect,
isn't there a cost, though, to this game?

676
00:33:57,754 --> 00:33:58,801
Cost?

677
00:33:58,874 --> 00:34:00,160
I don't know. Careers.

678
00:34:00,234 --> 00:34:01,360
Lives.

679
00:34:01,434 --> 00:34:04,677
I assume you're referring to Lionel Shrike.

680
00:34:05,114 --> 00:34:06,957
I'm sorry, who?

681
00:34:07,034 --> 00:34:08,559
Lionel Shrike.

682
00:34:08,634 --> 00:34:13,003
A middling magician who drowned
in the Hudson River 30 years ago.

683
00:34:13,074 --> 00:34:16,840
On Mr. Bradley's first special,
he revealed all of Shrike's tricks.

684
00:34:16,914 --> 00:34:20,396
The next year,
Shrike tried to stage a comeback.

685
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:21,919
He was shackled inside a safe,

686
00:34:21,994 --> 00:34:23,803
and dropped into the river.

687
00:34:23,874 --> 00:34:25,035
But he never resurfaced.

688
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:27,355
You mean he died?

689
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:29,243
I didn't kill him.

690
00:34:29,314 --> 00:34:33,558
He killed himself trying to do something
he wasn't prepared to handle.

691
00:34:33,634 --> 00:34:35,875
You do realize this is a game?

692
00:34:35,954 --> 00:34:37,763
Believe me, it's not a game.

693
00:34:37,834 --> 00:34:38,995
It is a game.

694
00:34:39,074 --> 00:34:40,838
You're the game. You're being played.

695
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:44,361
And your pathetic attempts
at fawning to gain my trust...

696
00:34:44,434 --> 00:34:46,198
I mean, come on.

697
00:34:46,274 --> 00:34:47,275
You got me.

698
00:34:47,354 --> 00:34:48,640
If you really want to know

699
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:52,514
how a bank in Paris was robbed
from a stage in Las Vegas,

700
00:34:52,594 --> 00:34:54,562
my special comes out next month.

701
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,760
Or I could just bring you in

702
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:58,314
on obstruction charges
and force you to tell me.

703
00:34:58,394 --> 00:34:59,919
Unless, of course,
what you're trying to say to me is that

704
00:34:59,994 --> 00:35:03,123
you actually don't know how they did it.

705
00:35:05,114 --> 00:35:07,276
Showmanship and theatrics.

706
00:35:07,474 --> 00:35:09,602
When a magician waves his hand and says,

707
00:35:09,714 --> 00:35:11,318
"This is where the magic is happening."

708
00:35:11,554 --> 00:35:14,000
The real trick is happening somewhere else.

709
00:35:14,474 --> 00:35:17,444
Misdirection. A basic concept of magic.

710
00:35:17,634 --> 00:35:19,921
Not interested in the concepts of magic.

711
00:35:20,114 --> 00:35:21,639
I wanna know how they robbed a bank.

712
00:35:21,794 --> 00:35:24,479
You're an idiot if you think
they robbed a bank.

713
00:35:24,754 --> 00:35:25,994
But don't take my word for it.

714
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:28,158
How about a trip to Paris?

715
00:35:28,634 --> 00:35:31,763
Hermia,
the teleportation helmet, please, darling?

716
00:35:32,274 --> 00:35:33,605
You're joking, right?

717
00:35:33,794 --> 00:35:36,035
You wanna know how they did it or not?

718
00:35:36,754 --> 00:35:39,439
I'm just gonna put this on your head.

719
00:35:40,114 --> 00:35:41,479
Step right up.

720
00:35:42,754 --> 00:35:44,438
There you go.

721
00:35:45,114 --> 00:35:48,755
Now we just pull this down
all safe and snug.

722
00:35:49,794 --> 00:35:52,718
Make yourself comfortable. There we go.

723
00:35:52,794 --> 00:35:54,956
And when you're ready to go to Paris,

724
00:35:55,034 --> 00:35:57,116
just say the magic word.

725
00:35:57,434 --> 00:35:58,595
Blow me?

726
00:35:59,594 --> 00:36:01,358
- That'll suffice.
- Bon voyage.

727
00:36:13,394 --> 00:36:16,523
I personally prefer to take the stairs to Paris.

728
00:36:17,154 --> 00:36:19,122
Welcome to the City of Light, Agent Rhodes.

729
00:36:19,314 --> 00:36:21,078
Hardy har har. What was with the helmet?

730
00:36:21,474 --> 00:36:22,680
My fun.

731
00:36:23,994 --> 00:36:25,280
What?

732
00:36:25,354 --> 00:36:26,719
Nothing.

733
00:36:28,474 --> 00:36:29,635
So they got a vault set.

734
00:36:29,714 --> 00:36:30,795
Yes.

735
00:36:30,874 --> 00:36:32,000
And it's the exact replica

736
00:36:32,154 --> 00:36:33,235
of the little French guy's bank.

737
00:36:33,314 --> 00:36:34,361
So he's a plant.

738
00:36:34,434 --> 00:36:35,924
He was a dupe, not a plant.

739
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:38,156
They chose him. They knew
which seat he was in.

740
00:36:38,594 --> 00:36:40,835
No, no, no, the audience picked the seat.

741
00:36:41,634 --> 00:36:44,399
Unless, of course,
the audience didn't pick the seat.

742
00:36:44,474 --> 00:36:46,556
They let them think they picked the seat.

743
00:36:46,674 --> 00:36:48,039
We'll choose one at random then.

744
00:36:48,554 --> 00:36:50,397
<i>Actually, they were just palming the ball</i>

745
00:36:50,514 --> 00:36:52,198
<i>with the seat number they wanted.</i>

746
00:36:52,674 --> 00:36:54,517
We are looking at row number 5.

747
00:36:54,674 --> 00:36:56,005
Henley, could I please
have a seat number?

748
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:57,515
Lucky number 13.

749
00:36:57,594 --> 00:36:59,642
Could you just confirm that this
is, in fact, your seat?

750
00:36:59,714 --> 00:37:01,318
<i>He was selected.</i>

751
00:37:02,034 --> 00:37:04,082
<i>They programmed his mind
to make him go to Las Vegas.</i>

752
00:37:04,194 --> 00:37:05,355
Viva Las Vegas.

753
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:09,483
<i>And then
they kept reinforcing it, until he did.</i>

754
00:37:10,674 --> 00:37:11,914
<i>They trailed him.</i>

755
00:37:12,034 --> 00:37:13,160
<i>They studied him.</i>

756
00:37:13,234 --> 00:37:14,998
<i>Nothing was left to chance.</i>

757
00:37:17,274 --> 00:37:18,275
I got his measurements.

758
00:37:18,354 --> 00:37:20,721
<i>He had no idea he was their target.</i>

759
00:37:20,874 --> 00:37:23,002
<i>And they simply activated him in Vegas.</i>

760
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:24,360
When I snap my fingers...

761
00:37:24,554 --> 00:37:27,034
And once again, Merritt McKinney.

762
00:37:27,154 --> 00:37:28,235
<i>But how did they know what bank was his?</i>

763
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:29,720
- You're kidding.
- Really?

764
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,440
Can you be any more
of a condescending ass?

765
00:37:32,554 --> 00:37:33,555
Yes.

766
00:37:34,314 --> 00:37:35,315
Like this.

767
00:37:36,514 --> 00:37:39,802
There's a very rare, very mysterious way

768
00:37:39,874 --> 00:37:43,401
in which a magician divines
an audience member's bank.

769
00:37:44,394 --> 00:37:45,395
You ready?

770
00:37:45,794 --> 00:37:46,795
Yes.

771
00:37:47,714 --> 00:37:49,125
Credit card.

772
00:37:49,474 --> 00:37:52,318
And that's how they got
the signature for the card

773
00:37:52,394 --> 00:37:54,362
they left in the vault in Paris.

774
00:37:54,434 --> 00:37:55,435
Very good.

775
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:57,164
You're being one-upped, Agent Rhodes.

776
00:37:57,434 --> 00:38:00,278
Okay, but they had to get
the signature card in the vault.

777
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:01,919
You said they didn't steal the money.

778
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,644
No, I didn't say they didn't steal the money.

779
00:38:03,754 --> 00:38:05,199
I said they didn't rob the bank.

780
00:38:06,354 --> 00:38:08,322
<i>My guess is that they targeted</i>

781
00:38:08,394 --> 00:38:10,078
<i>a shipment of freshly minted money</i>

782
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:14,079
<i>headed to the Frenchman's bank
on-board an armored truck.</i>

783
00:38:15,514 --> 00:38:18,279
<i>Which, of course,
is just as hard to break into.</i>

784
00:38:18,434 --> 00:38:21,040
<i>Unless you're already inside.</i>

785
00:38:40,594 --> 00:38:43,643
<i>And despite what the banks
would have you believe,</i>

786
00:38:43,714 --> 00:38:46,558
<i>the men who drive
these trucks are not exactly mental giants.</i>

787
00:38:48,274 --> 00:38:49,844
<i>For our Horsemen,</i>

788
00:38:49,914 --> 00:38:52,155
<i>it was almost too easy.</i>

789
00:38:58,474 --> 00:38:59,635
Hey, boys.

790
00:39:05,994 --> 00:39:09,601
So, how did they make the fake money
disappear from the vault? What is that?

791
00:39:09,994 --> 00:39:11,439
<i>Flash paper.</i>

792
00:39:13,674 --> 00:39:15,881
<i>Magicians use it all the time.</i>

793
00:39:21,074 --> 00:39:23,884
<i>Creates no smoke, leaves no residue.</i>

794
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:31,601
<i>Two days ago, no one heard of these guys,</i>

795
00:39:31,794 --> 00:39:34,365
<i>but tonight's show sold out in 35 seconds.</i>

796
00:39:34,434 --> 00:39:36,914
I think these guys have cracked
the secret to show business.

797
00:39:36,994 --> 00:39:39,759
Give your audience $3 million.

798
00:39:39,954 --> 00:39:41,319
Puts 'em in a good mood, doesn't it?

799
00:39:41,434 --> 00:39:42,640
Best finale ever.

800
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,160
<i>They're gonna be
the first magicians in history to get laid.</i>

801
00:39:45,234 --> 00:39:47,714
<i>Remember, if the oxygen mask comes down,</i>

802
00:39:47,794 --> 00:39:49,842
put it on the lawyer first. Remember.
- Oh, yes.

803
00:39:49,914 --> 00:39:52,281
<i>I always do. It's lawyer first,</i>

804
00:39:52,354 --> 00:39:54,402
<i>-then myself and then the children.
- Then yourself.</i>

805
00:39:54,474 --> 00:39:55,885
Yes. Then the children.

806
00:39:56,754 --> 00:39:59,439
Allow me to make plain
what we've both been thinking.

807
00:39:59,514 --> 00:40:00,675
And what's that?

808
00:40:00,754 --> 00:40:03,883
Well, obviously, you have feelings
of affection for Daniel.

809
00:40:03,954 --> 00:40:06,116
Unrequited and misguided,

810
00:40:06,194 --> 00:40:09,004
owing to his lack of emotional availability.

811
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,759
Consequently, you're very tightly...

812
00:40:11,834 --> 00:40:13,438
How should I put it?

813
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:14,955
Corked.

814
00:40:15,034 --> 00:40:16,035
Oh, lam?

815
00:40:16,114 --> 00:40:19,755
Now, recognizing that
you have physical needs not being met,

816
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,485
and strictly in the vein of
helping a sister out,

817
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:27,242
I invite you to think
of me as your own personal corkscrew.

818
00:40:27,474 --> 00:40:28,600
Wow. Thanks.

819
00:40:28,674 --> 00:40:31,439
Let me mull over
that offer of cheap and meaningless sex.

820
00:40:31,514 --> 00:40:35,439
Cheap and meaningless, maybe,
but not time-consuming.

821
00:40:39,074 --> 00:40:41,076
<i>We should be getting there
a few minutes early.</i>

822
00:40:41,154 --> 00:40:42,235
<i>So, sit back, relax.</i>

823
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,078
<i>We should be in the Big Easy soon.</i>

824
00:40:44,154 --> 00:40:45,883
<i>Appreciate you flying with us today.</i>

825
00:40:45,954 --> 00:40:48,400
So, what's in it
for Tressler, besides the money?

826
00:40:48,474 --> 00:40:49,555
Ego.

827
00:40:51,234 --> 00:40:52,998
Okay, pick your card.

828
00:40:53,474 --> 00:40:55,954
Look at it, put it in the deck, and tell me.

829
00:40:56,034 --> 00:40:57,877
No, don't tell me.

830
00:40:57,954 --> 00:40:59,763
-Okay-
-Okay-

831
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:01,245
Thaddeus was there that night.

832
00:41:01,314 --> 00:41:03,760
He knows exactly
how they pulled it off. What about him?

833
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:05,518
What are you saying?

834
00:41:05,594 --> 00:41:07,084
You think they could be working together.

835
00:41:07,154 --> 00:41:08,599
I don't know. All I know is that these guys

836
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,119
were a bunch of street magicians

837
00:41:10,194 --> 00:41:11,764
a year ago with no resources.

838
00:41:11,834 --> 00:41:14,405
So, how do they go from doing that to this

839
00:41:14,474 --> 00:41:15,919
without some kind of outside help?

840
00:41:15,994 --> 00:41:17,439
Is this your card?

841
00:41:17,514 --> 00:41:20,916
No, my card is sitting
over there in that guy's lap.

842
00:41:21,554 --> 00:41:23,283
Nice shuffle.

843
00:41:23,354 --> 00:41:24,515
You know, this is hard.

844
00:41:24,594 --> 00:41:25,641
According to this book,

845
00:41:25,714 --> 00:41:29,764
some of those guys practice one simple
move eight hours a day for years.

846
00:41:29,874 --> 00:41:32,923
Really? Some of those guys
seriously need to get a life.

847
00:41:32,994 --> 00:41:35,235
Is it magicians, in general,
you have a problem with?

848
00:41:35,314 --> 00:41:37,555
Or specifically those guys?

849
00:41:38,314 --> 00:41:40,920
I could care less about magicians in general.

850
00:41:40,994 --> 00:41:43,838
What I hate is people
who exploit other people.

851
00:41:43,914 --> 00:41:45,040
Exploit them how?

852
00:41:45,114 --> 00:41:46,479
Try again.

853
00:41:47,594 --> 00:41:49,517
By taking advantage of their weaknesses.

854
00:41:49,594 --> 00:41:52,359
Their need
to believe in something that's unexplainable

855
00:41:52,434 --> 00:41:55,324
in order to make their lives more bearable.

856
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:57,198
I see it as a strength.

857
00:41:57,274 --> 00:41:59,242
My life is happier when I believe that.

858
00:42:00,274 --> 00:42:01,639
Is this your card?

859
00:42:02,794 --> 00:42:03,920
Yeah.

860
00:42:04,754 --> 00:42:05,835
Yeah?

861
00:42:05,954 --> 00:42:07,479
- Yeah.
- Cool.

862
00:42:09,874 --> 00:42:13,242
That smile on your face. Is it real?

863
00:42:13,314 --> 00:42:14,554
Maybe.

864
00:42:15,034 --> 00:42:17,435
So let me ask you, Mr. Detective Man.

865
00:42:17,514 --> 00:42:18,959
Do you feel exploited?

866
00:42:19,034 --> 00:42:22,277
Or did you have maybe
a tiny, tiny bit of fun?

867
00:42:24,554 --> 00:42:25,794
Guy goes to the doctor.

868
00:42:25,874 --> 00:42:26,921
Doctor says, "Sir, you're gonna

869
00:42:26,994 --> 00:42:28,075
"have to stop masturbating."

870
00:42:28,154 --> 00:42:29,155
He says, "Why?"

871
00:42:29,234 --> 00:42:30,724
He says, "So I can finish the examination."

872
00:42:30,794 --> 00:42:31,875
Oh, Danny, can I talk to you about

873
00:42:31,954 --> 00:42:33,524
-my role in the show real quick?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

874
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:34,834
Hey, guys.

875
00:42:35,314 --> 00:42:36,725
We got a show to prepare for.

876
00:42:36,794 --> 00:42:39,161
Do we now?

877
00:42:39,234 --> 00:42:40,281
No, no, no, don't do that.

878
00:42:40,354 --> 00:42:41,515
You're not doing that thing to me. No.

879
00:42:41,634 --> 00:42:42,920
What thing? I'm just looking at you.

880
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:44,598
No, you're not.
I've been watching you for a year.

881
00:42:44,674 --> 00:42:46,085
I know all of your little tricks.

882
00:42:46,154 --> 00:42:47,315
That what they are to you? Tricks?

883
00:42:47,394 --> 00:42:49,123
Yes, it's gimmicks. it's Barnum statements.

884
00:42:49,194 --> 00:42:50,923
It's reading the eyes. Body language. I get it.

885
00:42:50,994 --> 00:42:52,644
If it's such an easy thing,
why don't you do Henley?

886
00:42:52,714 --> 00:42:54,478
Yeah, Danny. Why don't you do me?

887
00:42:54,554 --> 00:42:56,761
No, you're too easy. I'll do Jasmine.

888
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:58,324
No.

889
00:42:58,634 --> 00:42:59,681
Do me.

890
00:42:59,754 --> 00:43:01,165
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Do Art.

891
00:43:01,234 --> 00:43:02,235
Okay.

892
00:43:02,354 --> 00:43:03,401
Even better.

893
00:43:03,474 --> 00:43:04,475
- Art.
- Yeah.

894
00:43:04,594 --> 00:43:06,358
But I warn you, I can be difficult to read,

895
00:43:06,434 --> 00:43:07,481
when I want to be.

896
00:43:07,554 --> 00:43:09,761
Just stay with me, okay?

897
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:12,277
So, Art, you were a tough kid.

898
00:43:12,394 --> 00:43:14,442
You know, kind of a real rapscallion.

899
00:43:14,514 --> 00:43:16,437
You had a dog. A real tough dog.

900
00:43:16,514 --> 00:43:18,437
A brutish breed. Like a real...

901
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:20,676
I want to say, Ben the bulldog.

902
00:43:20,754 --> 00:43:23,200
Actually, I was a prissy little tot.

903
00:43:23,274 --> 00:43:26,357
I had a fluffy white cat called Snuffles.

904
00:43:27,874 --> 00:43:29,205
Sorry.

905
00:43:29,354 --> 00:43:30,480
Wait, let me try one.

906
00:43:30,554 --> 00:43:31,635
- I can do way better than that.
- Let him do it.

907
00:43:31,714 --> 00:43:32,795
Come on, give me
one more time. One more time.

908
00:43:32,914 --> 00:43:34,484
He can do way better than that.

909
00:43:34,554 --> 00:43:35,555
Let's do family.

910
00:43:35,674 --> 00:43:38,883
You had an uncle on your mother's side.

911
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:41,605
He had a real, kind of...
A real masculine name.

912
00:43:41,714 --> 00:43:43,955
A real, kind of, salt-of-the-earth...

913
00:43:44,034 --> 00:43:45,559
You know, a real stick-it-to-you...

914
00:43:45,634 --> 00:43:49,798
Like it was some kind of Paul.
Thompson? Was it a Paul...

915
00:43:49,954 --> 00:43:51,558
Okay. You know what? I got nothin'.

916
00:43:51,634 --> 00:43:53,124
- Nearly though.
- Was I?

917
00:43:53,194 --> 00:43:56,641
Yeah. My uncle's name
was Cushman Armitage.

918
00:43:56,794 --> 00:43:58,364
Really? Snuffles and Cushman Armitage?

919
00:43:58,434 --> 00:43:59,481
That was your childhood?

920
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:01,921
I certainly hope
tonight's show is gonna be better than this.

921
00:44:02,794 --> 00:44:04,922
Don't worry. Just you wait.

922
00:44:10,234 --> 00:44:13,317
Hey. Come on, give me some good news
on a hotel room, please.

923
00:44:13,394 --> 00:44:14,520
<i>What, are you kidding me?</i>

924
00:44:14,594 --> 00:44:16,164
No, it's Mardi Gras, Dylan.

925
00:44:16,234 --> 00:44:18,157
There's nothing within sight of the theater.

926
00:44:18,234 --> 00:44:20,601
Hold on a second. Hold on.
Where is this woman?

927
00:44:22,474 --> 00:44:24,442
Hey, hey! There you are.

928
00:44:24,754 --> 00:44:26,119
What, the French girl
doing a little sightseeing

929
00:44:26,234 --> 00:44:27,235
while she's in New Orleans?

930
00:44:27,314 --> 00:44:29,555
No. In fact, here, speaking French

931
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:31,318
is actually an asset.

932
00:44:31,394 --> 00:44:32,919
Do you see that woman up there?

933
00:44:33,954 --> 00:44:35,080
That's Marie Claire.

934
00:44:35,154 --> 00:44:37,441
And she has a lovely apartment for us.

935
00:44:39,754 --> 00:44:41,085
You're welcome.

936
00:44:41,434 --> 00:44:42,720
Yeah.

937
00:44:42,794 --> 00:44:44,444
We got a place.

938
00:44:46,394 --> 00:44:49,603
I want two each inside of here.
The other 30 around here.

939
00:44:49,674 --> 00:44:51,085
Roofs, alleys, balconies.

940
00:44:51,154 --> 00:44:54,237
- Eyes on The Horsemen at all times.
- Yes, sir.

941
00:44:54,314 --> 00:44:58,160
Wow, 100 years ago, William Robinson
took the name Chung Ling Soo

942
00:44:58,234 --> 00:45:02,125
and spent his entire life
never speaking English in public.

943
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:05,797
This other guy, Maximillian...

944
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,964
I am not interested in a history lesson
on magic at this moment.

945
00:45:09,394 --> 00:45:11,874
If you want to keep playing
into their hands, go for it.

946
00:45:11,954 --> 00:45:13,877
I'm just
trying to understand how they think.

947
00:45:13,954 --> 00:45:16,161
You think I'm playing
in their hands, do you?

948
00:45:16,234 --> 00:45:19,044
I don't know how any of that
is gonna go against this.

949
00:45:19,114 --> 00:45:21,321
This what? This magic?

950
00:45:22,754 --> 00:45:24,085
Lionel Shrike.

951
00:45:24,314 --> 00:45:27,841
In Central Park,
he has a guy pick a card and sign it.

952
00:45:27,914 --> 00:45:30,918
Then he goes to a tree
that has been there 20 years.

953
00:45:31,114 --> 00:45:32,525
They saw the tree in half.

954
00:45:32,594 --> 00:45:34,676
Inside the tree, encased in glass,

955
00:45:34,754 --> 00:45:36,597
is the card with the signature.

956
00:45:36,674 --> 00:45:37,800
HOW did he do that?

957
00:45:37,914 --> 00:45:41,236
I have no idea.
But I'm sure there's a logical explanation.

958
00:45:44,474 --> 00:45:45,919
You guys got a guy in that lobby yet?

959
00:45:45,994 --> 00:45:47,564
<i>No, but I do have some good news.</i>

960
00:45:47,794 --> 00:45:49,762
Remember how Atlas is such a control freak,

961
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:51,598
he's got his whole crew
on those tracking bracelets?

962
00:45:51,674 --> 00:45:52,960
What tracking bracelets?

963
00:45:53,034 --> 00:45:54,274
<i>He has every member of his crew</i>

964
00:45:54,354 --> 00:45:55,958
<i>wearing a tracking bracelet.</i>

965
00:45:56,034 --> 00:45:58,116
<i>Those bracelets are on a sub-8 flat-band.</i>

966
00:45:58,194 --> 00:45:59,400
<i>So as long as Atlas is tracking them...</i>

967
00:45:59,474 --> 00:46:00,555
Next.

968
00:46:00,634 --> 00:46:01,715
...our boys can track Atlas

969
00:46:01,794 --> 00:46:03,205
from right here in the mobile command unit.

970
00:46:03,314 --> 00:46:05,282
<i>Okay, call me if you get any movement.</i>

971
00:46:05,354 --> 00:46:06,685
Copy that.

972
00:46:15,474 --> 00:46:17,841
You are missing the big picture here, Dylan.

973
00:46:19,194 --> 00:46:22,835
There is a place in Paris, Pont des Arts.

974
00:46:22,994 --> 00:46:26,840
Sometimes in the mornings
I sit on a bench there.

975
00:46:27,234 --> 00:46:28,884
And I watch the people make a wish

976
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,076
and lock it in a lock on the bridge.

977
00:46:31,154 --> 00:46:33,839
Then throw the key into the Seine.

978
00:46:35,674 --> 00:46:40,236
All day they do this.
Mothers, lovers, old men.

979
00:46:40,514 --> 00:46:42,482
Watching the key sink into the water

980
00:46:42,554 --> 00:46:45,797
and their secret is locked away forever.

981
00:46:46,674 --> 00:46:50,998
Real and, at the same time, magical.

982
00:46:57,234 --> 00:46:58,360
So,

983
00:46:59,194 --> 00:47:02,880
do you really think it's possible
there's a fifth Horseman?

984
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:05,594
Yeah.

985
00:47:12,034 --> 00:47:13,957
<i>There is a legend of a secret order</i>

986
00:47:14,034 --> 00:47:15,923
<i>born in ancient Egypt called</i>

987
00:47:16,354 --> 00:47:17,685
<i>"The Eye."</i>

988
00:47:19,354 --> 00:47:21,834
<i>It is said they perfected sleight of hand</i>

989
00:47:21,914 --> 00:47:23,996
<i>to steal food from the Pharaohs</i>

990
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:25,883
<i>and give it to the slaves.</i>

991
00:47:26,274 --> 00:47:27,480
<i>Their purpose?</i>

992
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:31,559
<i>Using magic
and illusion to even the scales of justice.</i>

993
00:47:32,434 --> 00:47:36,758
<i>Are The Horsemen next in a long line
of fools to believe this myth?</i>

994
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:41,921
Will they evade the rules of law and logic
like they did in Las Vegas?

995
00:47:42,714 --> 00:47:47,003
Or will the dark mysticism
of this Southern swampland

996
00:47:47,554 --> 00:47:49,158
get the better of them?

997
00:47:55,594 --> 00:47:57,084
Bravo, Mr. Bradley.

998
00:47:57,234 --> 00:47:59,236
Either you have a cease-and-desist,

999
00:47:59,314 --> 00:48:01,635
which you don't, or you should leave.

1000
00:48:01,834 --> 00:48:05,600
If I want something to cease or desist,

1001
00:48:06,754 --> 00:48:07,915
it does.

1002
00:48:08,114 --> 00:48:09,320
Take five.

1003
00:48:09,634 --> 00:48:11,443
According to your potential backers,

1004
00:48:11,634 --> 00:48:15,275
you stand to make 2.5 million tops

1005
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,959
from your best special.

1006
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:19,845
I have here a check

1007
00:48:21,594 --> 00:48:22,834
for 3.5 million.

1008
00:48:23,114 --> 00:48:24,115
To walk away?

1009
00:48:24,274 --> 00:48:27,960
To fly away. My jet is at your disposal.

1010
00:48:30,114 --> 00:48:32,799
Let's not kid ourselves, Mr. Tressler.

1011
00:48:34,354 --> 00:48:36,436
You're in this to ride them up.

1012
00:48:36,954 --> 00:48:38,956
I'm in it to ride them down.

1013
00:48:39,274 --> 00:48:42,278
I take it that we do not have a deal.

1014
00:48:43,794 --> 00:48:48,118
And therein lies our conflict.

1015
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:52,794
Let me be blunt.

1016
00:48:53,234 --> 00:48:57,683
My bank account
is much, much bigger than yours.

1017
00:48:57,874 --> 00:49:00,718
And my lawyers are much stronger.

1018
00:49:01,074 --> 00:49:04,157
And they will manacle you

1019
00:49:05,394 --> 00:49:07,237
with so many injunctions.

1020
00:49:07,474 --> 00:49:09,715
Until you stand by, hopelessly watching

1021
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:12,485
everything that you own drain away

1022
00:49:13,314 --> 00:49:15,840
in front of your greedy little eyes.

1023
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:18,161
This isn't the first time I've been threatened.

1024
00:49:19,554 --> 00:49:21,044
And I'm still here.

1025
00:49:21,114 --> 00:49:25,483
It is, however,
the first time you've been threatened by me.

1026
00:49:26,314 --> 00:49:30,763
And if you do anything
to sully my investment,

1027
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:33,235
the ride down, which you mentioned,

1028
00:49:33,314 --> 00:49:38,559
will be sudden, precipitous,
and measurable on the Richter scale.

1029
00:49:40,194 --> 00:49:42,196
You shouldn't have done that.

1030
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:45,118
According to superstition,

1031
00:49:45,314 --> 00:49:48,318
one who uses a doll
to enact one's own wrath,

1032
00:49:48,394 --> 00:49:52,877
is likely to bring that
very wrath unto himself.

1033
00:49:53,674 --> 00:49:55,199
Isn't that funny?

1034
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,036
And I thought you didn't believe in magic.

1035
00:50:07,954 --> 00:50:09,035
Do me a favor.

1036
00:50:09,114 --> 00:50:13,164
Visualize your most adventurous
sexual experience.

1037
00:50:13,274 --> 00:50:14,321
Stay out of my head, you perv.

1038
00:50:14,394 --> 00:50:18,080
Well, no, if I stay out of your head,
I'm never gonna get into your pants.

1039
00:50:18,194 --> 00:50:20,196
- Right.
- So let's stick with this exercise.

1040
00:50:20,274 --> 00:50:22,163
- And it helps...
- Pardon the intrusion.

1041
00:50:22,234 --> 00:50:24,805
I just wanted to wish you good luck tonight.

1042
00:50:24,874 --> 00:50:27,480
What, so you can try to expose us later
on your little website?

1043
00:50:27,554 --> 00:50:28,760
And on demand.

1044
00:50:28,834 --> 00:50:31,838
- That's not gonna happen.
- Oh, no?

1045
00:50:31,914 --> 00:50:34,918
Operating on a special plane
because of The Eye?

1046
00:50:35,594 --> 00:50:40,441
I heard it's a lovely place.
Lots of starshine and moonbeams.

1047
00:50:40,514 --> 00:50:42,994
Make any magician's wish come true.

1048
00:50:43,074 --> 00:50:44,519
You've come a long way,

1049
00:50:44,594 --> 00:50:46,403
much further
than anyone would have expected

1050
00:50:46,514 --> 00:50:48,516
of a bunch of wanna-bes and has-beens.

1051
00:50:48,594 --> 00:50:52,758
If by "has-been" you're referring to me,
I just wanna say I'm flattered,

1052
00:50:52,834 --> 00:50:56,236
because I always considered myself
a never-was.

1053
00:50:56,314 --> 00:50:58,476
Do you mind if I do a quick read on you?

1054
00:50:59,274 --> 00:51:00,275
By all means.

1055
00:51:01,274 --> 00:51:05,916
Okay, I'm picturing a little boy.

1056
00:51:06,034 --> 00:51:08,958
He wants to be a great magician someday.

1057
00:51:09,034 --> 00:51:10,798
And though he's good,
he's not quite good enough.

1058
00:51:10,914 --> 00:51:14,999
So he ends up at the bottom
of the entertainment food chain,

1059
00:51:15,074 --> 00:51:18,635
feeding off of those
who have the talent that he never did.

1060
00:51:18,754 --> 00:51:21,280
Tell me. Am I getting close?

1061
00:51:23,954 --> 00:51:26,958
Wait. Before you go. I'm working
on something new. Do you have a second?

1062
00:51:27,634 --> 00:51:30,478
Okay. Name a card.

1063
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,124
- King of hearts.
- Knew it.

1064
00:51:32,194 --> 00:51:33,434
Okay.

1065
00:51:40,634 --> 00:51:43,717
- It's up your left sleeve.
- Is it?

1066
00:51:43,794 --> 00:51:45,558
No. No, I don't see it up there.

1067
00:51:45,634 --> 00:51:49,355
You know, why don't you check
your unnecessary velveteen pocket there?

1068
00:51:51,194 --> 00:51:52,195
Yeah.

1069
00:51:55,634 --> 00:52:00,640
Anyway, thank you so much for coming by,
but this is kind of a talent only area, so...

1070
00:52:01,914 --> 00:52:02,915
Break a leg.

1071
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:05,156
Hey, you break something, too.

1081
00:52:28,954 --> 00:52:30,479
Nice watch.

1082
00:52:31,634 --> 00:52:34,001
It's a family heirloom.

1083
00:52:37,194 --> 00:52:39,925
By the way, I know how he did that trick.

1084
00:52:39,994 --> 00:52:41,564
- Who?
- Shrike.

1085
00:52:41,634 --> 00:52:43,921
So, when he was 14,

1086
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,156
he saw a hole in a tree in Central Park.

1087
00:52:46,234 --> 00:52:49,920
He had a guy who worked at the carousel

1088
00:52:49,994 --> 00:52:52,645
sign a card for what looked
like a routine little trick.

1089
00:52:52,714 --> 00:52:53,875
And?

1090
00:52:53,954 --> 00:52:58,118
At the guy's retirement, 18 years later,

1091
00:52:58,194 --> 00:53:01,482
Shrike performs, has the guy sign a card,

1092
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:03,124
and presto!

1093
00:53:03,234 --> 00:53:04,963
The card is in the tree.

1094
00:53:05,034 --> 00:53:06,923
It was in the tree for 18 years.

1095
00:53:06,994 --> 00:53:08,484
The card was in the tree.

1096
00:53:08,554 --> 00:53:12,559
The tree grew around the card in 18 years.
I mean, that isn't magic. It's not magic.

1097
00:53:12,634 --> 00:53:15,558
The point is, the trick
was not to look closely.

1098
00:53:15,634 --> 00:53:17,636
It was to look so far

1099
00:53:17,714 --> 00:53:20,524
that you see 20 years into the past.

1100
00:53:20,594 --> 00:53:23,484
After Shrike drowned,
they never found the body.

1101
00:53:23,554 --> 00:53:25,363
What are you suggesting?

1108
00:53:43,914 --> 00:53:45,598
Thank you. Before we begin,

1109
00:53:45,674 --> 00:53:47,722
we'd like to single out
two people in particular.

1110
00:53:47,794 --> 00:53:50,274
A man and a woman to whom
we'd like to dedicate tonight's performance.

1111
00:53:50,354 --> 00:53:52,197
FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes

1112
00:53:52,274 --> 00:53:57,997
and the lovely, if somewhat inexperienced,
Interpol Agent Alma Dray, everyone.

1113
00:53:58,914 --> 00:54:03,044
Yeah, Agent Rhodes has personally vowed
to "nail us."

1114
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:07,597
And we encourage him to do so
if he has the brains and the fur.

1115
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:14,036
What is magic?

1116
00:54:14,114 --> 00:54:16,640
Our argument,
nothing but targeted deception.

1117
00:54:18,314 --> 00:54:19,725
So I want you to look.

1118
00:54:20,274 --> 00:54:22,356
Look as closely as possible.

1119
00:54:22,754 --> 00:54:24,483
Because the tricks you are about to see

1120
00:54:24,994 --> 00:54:26,723
may not seem connected.

1121
00:54:26,794 --> 00:54:28,717
But we assure you, they are.

1122
00:54:29,674 --> 00:54:32,484
Is what follows 100 different tricks?

1123
00:54:32,794 --> 00:54:36,480
Or is it one giant illusion?

1124
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:47,118
And now for one
of the oldest tricks in the book.

1125
00:54:47,234 --> 00:54:49,362
Danny, if you wouldn't mind
opening up the box,

1126
00:54:49,434 --> 00:54:51,721
and showing everybody
that it's completely empty.

1127
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:55,919
Now, we're gonna need
12 courageous volunteers.

1128
00:54:56,114 --> 00:54:58,355
I'm gonna take sweet little Fluffy here,

1129
00:54:58,474 --> 00:55:01,284
and put her inside this mystery box.

1130
00:55:01,714 --> 00:55:03,443
There are two pencils out there.

1131
00:55:03,514 --> 00:55:04,754
Hold 'em up high. Let me see 'em.

1132
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,324
- Here!
- Yeah!

1133
00:55:06,754 --> 00:55:08,722
And now, you will say the magic word.

1134
00:55:08,794 --> 00:55:10,034
Abracadabra.

1135
00:55:10,154 --> 00:55:11,519
Yes, and I will wave this magic wand

1136
00:55:11,594 --> 00:55:13,198
for no reason. And then...

1137
00:55:13,274 --> 00:55:15,675
Fluffy has
magically vanished before your very eyes.

1138
00:55:17,034 --> 00:55:19,275
If you haven't experienced mass hypnosis,

1139
00:55:19,354 --> 00:55:20,515
you're about to.

1140
00:55:20,754 --> 00:55:21,880
And sleep.

1141
00:55:21,954 --> 00:55:24,798
Down, down. Sleep, sleep.
Completely sleep.

1142
00:55:24,874 --> 00:55:26,444
Good, good. Sleep, sleep.

1143
00:55:26,514 --> 00:55:28,562
And now we are gonna debunk

1144
00:55:28,634 --> 00:55:30,796
a few magic myths this evening.

1145
00:55:30,874 --> 00:55:34,037
We all know that Fluffy is,
in fact, alive and well.

1146
00:55:34,314 --> 00:55:36,885
And Fluffy has miraculously appeared.

1147
00:55:36,954 --> 00:55:38,479
As has the mirror

1148
00:55:38,554 --> 00:55:40,955
which makes the box only
appear as though it's empty.

1149
00:55:41,034 --> 00:55:43,116
When you hear the word "freeze"

1150
00:55:43,354 --> 00:55:45,561
you are all football players.

1151
00:55:46,034 --> 00:55:48,560
And your job is to tackle,

1152
00:55:48,714 --> 00:55:50,045
dismantle,

1153
00:55:50,234 --> 00:55:51,395
crush,

1154
00:55:51,634 --> 00:55:53,955
tear limb from limb,

1155
00:55:54,354 --> 00:55:56,083
the quarterback.

1156
00:55:57,434 --> 00:56:00,961
Now, we've all heard
of pulling the rabbit out of the hat.

1157
00:56:01,034 --> 00:56:04,038
But has anyone heard
of pulling a hat out of a rabbit?

1158
00:56:08,434 --> 00:56:10,914
You will know who the quarterback is.

1159
00:56:10,994 --> 00:56:14,316
He will be the one saying that word.

1160
00:56:14,394 --> 00:56:15,600
Freeze.

1161
00:56:26,394 --> 00:56:28,396
Three, two, one...

1162
00:56:35,754 --> 00:56:37,722
Put your hands in the middle.
One, two, three...

1163
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:39,239
Kill the quarterback!

1164
00:56:39,314 --> 00:56:40,918
Get on back to your seats.

1165
00:56:41,154 --> 00:56:43,282
I got a feeling
I'm gonna be seeing you soon.

1166
00:57:15,714 --> 00:57:17,364
I guess you have lost some weight.

1167
00:57:32,914 --> 00:57:34,075
At the intermission,

1168
00:57:34,274 --> 00:57:36,641
we asked you to write down
your current bank balance,

1169
00:57:36,834 --> 00:57:38,199
and seal it in an envelope.

1170
00:57:38,274 --> 00:57:39,924
Now it's time to take those envelopes out.

1171
00:57:39,994 --> 00:57:41,120
Everyone take 'em out.

1172
00:57:42,554 --> 00:57:44,044
Now, everybody,

1173
00:57:44,114 --> 00:57:47,084
shout out your name. All at once. Go.

1174
00:57:48,794 --> 00:57:50,364
Shout 'em out.

1175
00:57:52,434 --> 00:57:54,357
Clement? Frannick?

1176
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,602
- Yeah! Up here!
- Oh. Way up there.

1177
00:57:56,674 --> 00:57:58,642
Okay. Dina? Robertson?

1178
00:57:58,834 --> 00:58:00,245
That's me!

1179
00:58:00,314 --> 00:58:02,635
Okay. Names. Names. Let's go.

1180
00:58:04,034 --> 00:58:06,002
Josepha Hickey?

1181
00:58:06,074 --> 00:58:07,075
That's me!

1182
00:58:07,154 --> 00:58:10,078
Josepha, I want you
to focus on your balance,

1183
00:58:10,194 --> 00:58:12,162
and count from one to 10 out loud.

1184
00:58:12,354 --> 00:58:14,004
One, two, three, four, five...

1185
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:15,314
Stop.

1186
00:58:15,594 --> 00:58:17,358
Is the first digit 5?

1187
00:58:17,434 --> 00:58:18,401
Yes.

1188
00:58:18,474 --> 00:58:19,839
Do it again. This time, faster.

1189
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:21,325
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1190
00:58:21,394 --> 00:58:22,475
Stop.

1191
00:58:23,194 --> 00:58:24,719
Six. Again.

1192
00:58:24,794 --> 00:58:25,795
One, two...

1193
00:58:25,994 --> 00:58:29,965
Josepha, is your
bank balance $562 as of today?

1194
00:58:30,154 --> 00:58:32,361
Yeah. That's what I got.

1195
00:58:34,074 --> 00:58:35,644
Unfortunately, you're wrong.

1196
00:58:35,794 --> 00:58:36,841
Okay, Dina,

1197
00:58:38,754 --> 00:58:39,801
1 ,

1198
00:58:40,394 --> 00:58:41,441
<i>4.</i>

1199
00:58:42,154 --> 00:58:43,155
<i>7,</i>

1200
00:58:44,114 --> 00:58:45,718
-7.
- Yeah.

1201
00:58:45,794 --> 00:58:49,560
You think it is.
But in fact, you, too, are wrong.

1202
00:58:49,634 --> 00:58:50,795
Clement.

1203
00:58:50,914 --> 00:58:53,884
You do not have $6,500 in your account.

1204
00:58:54,074 --> 00:58:57,874
In fact, everybody stand up. Everybody.

1205
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:02,684
Yeah. Put your envelopes to your forehead.

1206
00:59:04,154 --> 00:59:05,644
Focus on your number.

1207
00:59:09,874 --> 00:59:12,957
This is... Oh, dear. Just as I feared.

1208
00:59:13,074 --> 00:59:15,281
Oh, this is strange.

1209
00:59:15,674 --> 00:59:18,837
You know, I hate to say this,
but you're all wrong.

1210
00:59:19,034 --> 00:59:20,877
Every last one of you is dead wrong

1211
00:59:20,954 --> 00:59:23,116
about what you think is in your account.

1212
00:59:23,194 --> 00:59:24,605
Okay, you can sit down now.

1213
00:59:25,234 --> 00:59:27,521
Yeah. I almost forgot.

1214
00:59:27,634 --> 00:59:30,524
This evening would not be possible

1215
00:59:30,594 --> 00:59:34,121
if it weren't
for our great benefactor Arthur Tressler.

1216
00:59:35,634 --> 00:59:37,284
Big applause! Big applause!

1217
00:59:37,474 --> 00:59:38,839
Art, actually, why don't
you come up on stage

1218
00:59:38,914 --> 00:59:40,075
for the finale?

1219
00:59:40,154 --> 00:59:41,963
- Come on down, Art!
- Come on down, Art!

1220
00:59:42,034 --> 00:59:43,957
There he goes. Okay, good.

1221
00:59:44,034 --> 00:59:45,081
Are we on red?

1222
00:59:45,154 --> 00:59:47,202
Bright red. We're all standing by.

1223
00:59:47,274 --> 00:59:48,764
All right, no one leaves the theater. No one.

1224
00:59:48,834 --> 00:59:49,995
There he goes.

1225
00:59:50,634 --> 00:59:52,841
Now, Art, did you fill out your envelope?

1226
00:59:52,914 --> 00:59:54,757
Well, no need. We've done it for you.

1227
00:59:55,434 --> 00:59:58,244
Now, Art, I took a guess.

1228
00:59:58,314 --> 01:00:00,521
North of 140. Am I right?

1229
01:00:01,634 --> 01:00:04,319
That's 140 million, by the way.

1230
01:00:07,914 --> 01:00:08,915
I'm sorry, Merritt.

1231
01:00:09,114 --> 01:00:11,037
How can he be right about his balance

1232
01:00:11,114 --> 01:00:12,275
and everyone else be wrong?

1233
01:00:12,394 --> 01:00:15,762
I think possibly because he, too, is wrong.

1234
01:00:15,954 --> 01:00:18,082
Everybody, take out your paper.

1235
01:00:18,234 --> 01:00:20,805
And using the flashlight under your seat,

1236
01:00:20,954 --> 01:00:22,797
start to warm up that paper.

1237
01:00:22,954 --> 01:00:26,117
I think your correct balance
begins to appear.

1238
01:00:29,754 --> 01:00:32,963
Now, Art, don't worry,
we have a flashlight for you.

1239
01:00:33,274 --> 01:00:34,321
Yes.

1240
01:00:41,074 --> 01:00:42,485
Look.

1241
01:00:43,314 --> 01:00:44,645
What's going on there, Daniel?

1242
01:00:44,714 --> 01:00:46,239
Wait. This is weird. A second ago, it said

1243
01:00:46,474 --> 01:00:50,240
$144,579,651.

1244
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:51,315
But now...

1245
01:00:51,834 --> 01:00:54,838
Now it says $70,000 less.

1246
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,599
Josepha, can you stand up?

1247
01:00:59,674 --> 01:01:00,755
Yes.

1248
01:01:00,994 --> 01:01:02,644
Now, what is your new number?

1249
01:01:02,954 --> 01:01:07,278
$70,562 now in my account.

1250
01:01:10,394 --> 01:01:13,796
Is it possible that
Josepha's balance went up

1251
01:01:13,914 --> 01:01:15,996
the exact amount that Art's went down?

1252
01:01:16,114 --> 01:01:18,640
Hey. Check it out. It's happening again.

1253
01:01:19,034 --> 01:01:20,081
Is it?

1254
01:01:21,514 --> 01:01:23,835
Wow. It is.

1255
01:01:24,194 --> 01:01:27,357
Art's balance has gone down another 280K.

1256
01:01:27,514 --> 01:01:29,562
Dina Robertson? What did yours say?

1257
01:01:29,794 --> 01:01:33,560
$281,477.

1258
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:39,078
We have a confession to make.

1259
01:01:39,274 --> 01:01:41,276
She's right. We lied about something.

1260
01:01:41,354 --> 01:01:43,038
Yes. None of you were chosen at random.

1261
01:01:43,154 --> 01:01:45,555
All of you have one thing in common.

1262
01:01:46,114 --> 01:01:48,003
Everyone in this room was a victim

1263
01:01:48,074 --> 01:01:50,964
of the hard times that hit one of
America's most treasured cities.

1264
01:01:51,034 --> 01:01:53,640
Some of you lost your houses, your cars.

1265
01:01:54,074 --> 01:01:55,075
Your businesses.

1266
01:01:55,234 --> 01:01:56,235
Your loved ones.

1267
01:01:56,354 --> 01:01:59,563
But all of you were insured
by the same company.

1268
01:01:59,714 --> 01:02:01,603
Tressler Insurance.

1269
01:02:02,714 --> 01:02:03,875
You were abandoned.

1270
01:02:03,954 --> 01:02:05,035
You were loopholed...

1271
01:02:05,114 --> 01:02:06,354
...out of your settlements.

1272
01:02:07,714 --> 01:02:10,365
This is all for show. Correct?

1273
01:02:10,434 --> 01:02:12,960
"All" meaning we're doing it onstage
in front of a paying audience?

1274
01:02:13,274 --> 01:02:14,878
- Then, yes, it's for show.
- Whoa! Whoa!

1275
01:02:15,194 --> 01:02:17,674
I've got $82,000 in my bank account!

1276
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:19,677
It says it right here on my cell phone!

1277
01:02:19,954 --> 01:02:23,083
Everybody, look at your
cell phones right now! Everybody!

1278
01:02:30,874 --> 01:02:31,875
Is this for real?

1279
01:02:32,074 --> 01:02:33,235
I don't know.

1280
01:02:33,554 --> 01:02:34,635
<i>Is this happening?</i>

1281
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:36,364
I don't know! I can't tell!

1282
01:02:37,114 --> 01:02:39,242
Hey! Did you do this?

1283
01:02:40,474 --> 01:02:41,680
How could we, Art?

1284
01:02:41,754 --> 01:02:42,915
We don't have your password.

1285
01:02:43,234 --> 01:02:44,565
We'd need access to information

1286
01:02:44,634 --> 01:02:46,557
we could never get our hands on.

1287
01:02:46,754 --> 01:02:48,722
Yes, security questions, for instance, like,

1288
01:02:48,914 --> 01:02:50,484
I don't know, your mother's maiden name

1289
01:02:50,594 --> 01:02:52,084
or the name of your first pet.

1290
01:02:52,154 --> 01:02:53,918
Where would we get that information, Art?

1291
01:02:54,434 --> 01:02:56,084
You certainly would never tell us.

1292
01:02:58,834 --> 01:03:00,962
<i>We got confirmation.
It's really happening. They robbed him.</i>

1293
01:03:03,274 --> 01:03:04,719
Do not let them get away.

1294
01:03:04,834 --> 01:03:06,836
Hey, we left you the jet and the Rolls.

1295
01:03:13,794 --> 01:03:15,125
You got hell to pay!

1296
01:03:18,114 --> 01:03:19,115
Stop!

1297
01:03:19,834 --> 01:03:21,643
Stop! Nobody move!

1298
01:03:23,594 --> 01:03:24,675
Freeze!

1299
01:03:24,914 --> 01:03:26,484
Quarterback!

1300
01:03:29,354 --> 01:03:31,356
We are The Four Horsemen.

1301
01:03:31,834 --> 01:03:32,915
Good night.

1302
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,519
Get 'em off me!

1303
01:03:47,274 --> 01:03:48,878
Get off! Get off me!

1304
01:03:59,194 --> 01:04:00,605
Get off me!

1305
01:04:08,994 --> 01:04:11,201
All right. I want everyone
on the street! Everyone!

1306
01:04:17,914 --> 01:04:19,882
- Quarterback!
- Quarterback!

1307
01:04:21,354 --> 01:04:22,844
Fuller, meet me in front of the theater

1308
01:04:22,954 --> 01:04:24,524
and bring the tracker.

1309
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:26,995
Let's go! Let's go! Now! Come on! Let's go!

1310
01:04:27,074 --> 01:04:28,200
Give me the tracker.

1311
01:04:28,634 --> 01:04:29,635
Let's go.

1312
01:04:33,794 --> 01:04:35,080
FBI! Clear!

1313
01:04:35,794 --> 01:04:36,955
- Dylan!
- Damn.

1314
01:04:37,034 --> 01:04:38,035
What have you got?

1315
01:04:38,114 --> 01:04:39,639
That's him right there. Follow the red dot.

1316
01:04:39,714 --> 01:04:42,763
All right, I'll take this.
Go. Box 'em. Cut 'em off that way.

1317
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,239
He's turning left on Burgundy.

1318
01:05:22,954 --> 01:05:24,524
Hey! Move!

1319
01:05:24,594 --> 01:05:25,925
Move! Move!

1320
01:05:28,594 --> 01:05:30,323
I got him heading north on Bourbon.

1321
01:05:30,394 --> 01:05:32,283
- Sorry. Move, move!
- Hey!

1322
01:05:32,354 --> 01:05:34,356
Hey, excuse me. Move, move! Excuse me.

1323
01:05:45,794 --> 01:05:47,478
I've lost him at Bourbon.

1324
01:05:52,874 --> 01:05:54,876
Damn! Where are you?

1325
01:06:06,834 --> 01:06:08,040
Excuse me.

1326
01:06:14,114 --> 01:06:16,116
He's heading south on Exchange Place.

1327
01:06:18,514 --> 01:06:19,561
Stop!

1328
01:06:26,554 --> 01:06:27,919
What are you doing?

1329
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:33,482
He's going in Napoleon House.

1330
01:06:35,514 --> 01:06:37,084
Move! Move!

1331
01:06:37,954 --> 01:06:39,479
Move out of the way!

1332
01:06:40,194 --> 01:06:41,195
Hey!

1333
01:06:42,034 --> 01:06:43,035
Move!

1334
01:06:45,354 --> 01:06:47,641
He's in the bathroom.
I have him in the bathroom.

1335
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:50,041
No!No!No!

1336
01:06:51,914 --> 01:06:53,075
Freeze!

1337
01:06:53,914 --> 01:06:55,200
Lower your weapons!

1338
01:06:55,474 --> 01:06:56,555
What?

1339
01:06:56,794 --> 01:06:58,796
I'm tracking myself!

1340
01:06:59,314 --> 01:07:01,282
<i>The Horsemen
left egg on the face of what they call</i>

1341
01:07:01,354 --> 01:07:03,004
<i>the alphabet agencies,</i>

1342
01:07:03,114 --> 01:07:04,275
<i>calling into question</i>

1343
01:07:04,394 --> 01:07:06,635
<i>the efficacy of the FBI's task force</i>

1344
01:07:06,754 --> 01:07:09,485
<i>as well as the man in charge
of the investigation,</i>

1345
01:07:09,554 --> 01:07:11,044
<i>Special Agent Dylan Rhodes,</i>

1346
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:12,764
<i>who was publicly ridiculed,</i>

1347
01:07:12,874 --> 01:07:15,764
<i>and even tackled at tonight's performance.</i>

1348
01:07:16,114 --> 01:07:17,354
<i>Talk about a fumble.</i>

1349
01:07:17,434 --> 01:07:19,277
<i>This is quickly becoming a national story,</i>

1350
01:07:19,554 --> 01:07:22,364
<i>as The Horsemen have now
seemingly pulled off the impossible</i>

1351
01:07:22,594 --> 01:07:24,881
<i>for the second time in as many days.</i>

1352
01:07:25,114 --> 01:07:26,843
<i>Two nights ago in Vegas, The Horsemen</i>

1353
01:07:26,954 --> 01:07:28,319
<i>seemingly robbed a bank in Paris...</i>

1354
01:07:28,634 --> 01:07:29,795
Hey-

1355
01:07:30,954 --> 01:07:32,080
What are you doing?

1356
01:07:32,154 --> 01:07:33,565
I'm having a drink.

1357
01:07:36,634 --> 01:07:37,999
I came to get you.

1358
01:07:38,594 --> 01:07:39,800
I'm worried about you.

1359
01:07:39,954 --> 01:07:41,479
You're worried about me.
Well, I'm worried about you.

1360
01:07:41,594 --> 01:07:42,720
Atlas. You had him.

1361
01:07:42,794 --> 01:07:44,080
He didn't have a weapon.

1362
01:07:44,154 --> 01:07:45,644
I couldn't shoot him and you know that.

1363
01:07:45,754 --> 01:07:48,598
Yeah, but you... You let him go.

1364
01:07:48,754 --> 01:07:49,994
Didn't you?

1365
01:07:50,554 --> 01:07:52,238
A pretty French girl
shows up out of the blue,

1366
01:07:52,314 --> 01:07:54,043
acts like she's my partner
and then she lets the bad guy go?

1367
01:07:54,114 --> 01:07:55,240
Let go of my arm.

1368
01:07:55,314 --> 01:07:56,998
Who exactly are you anyway?

1369
01:07:59,154 --> 01:08:01,156
I thought you said you were a desk agent.

1370
01:08:06,194 --> 01:08:07,434
Not bad.

1371
01:08:09,354 --> 01:08:10,355
What is this?

1372
01:08:13,394 --> 01:08:14,839
What's the Eye of Horus?

1373
01:08:14,994 --> 01:08:17,998
Oh, certainly nothing
I want to get into tonight.

1374
01:08:18,114 --> 01:08:20,685
You're dismissive enough
about me when you're sober.

1375
01:08:21,194 --> 01:08:23,356
Find your way back yourself.

1376
01:08:27,354 --> 01:08:30,517
Mr. Bradley? Mr. Tressler would like you
to join him for a drink.

1377
01:08:39,954 --> 01:08:41,001
Sir.

1378
01:08:41,194 --> 01:08:42,434
Thank you.

1379
01:08:43,834 --> 01:08:46,041
What is your role with them?

1380
01:08:46,194 --> 01:08:47,195
Role?

1381
01:08:47,394 --> 01:08:49,123
Yes. You seem to know
everything about them.

1382
01:08:49,194 --> 01:08:51,003
What they're gonna do.
Where they're gonna be.

1383
01:08:51,194 --> 01:08:52,878
If it makes you feel any better,

1384
01:08:52,994 --> 01:08:54,200
this wasn't about you.

1385
01:08:54,274 --> 01:08:57,756
Please tell me why this was not about me.

1386
01:08:58,514 --> 01:09:01,085
This is a magic trick, Mr. Tressler.

1387
01:09:01,354 --> 01:09:03,675
Played out on a global scale.

1388
01:09:04,034 --> 01:09:08,005
You, sir, are the abracadabra.

1389
01:09:08,554 --> 01:09:11,364
The distraction, while they
set up the real trick.

1390
01:09:11,554 --> 01:09:15,718
I was a $140-million distraction?

1391
01:09:16,554 --> 01:09:17,715
Yes.

1392
01:09:18,394 --> 01:09:22,558
And that very ego that got you involved
with them in the first place

1393
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:24,559
is what keeps you from seeing that.

1394
01:09:24,714 --> 01:09:26,239
- You know...
-"I can destroy you."

1395
01:09:26,354 --> 01:09:27,765
Yes, I do know.

1396
01:09:27,954 --> 01:09:29,240
Well, you won't.

1397
01:09:29,794 --> 01:09:31,956
And you won't destroy them.

1398
01:09:32,074 --> 01:09:34,122
Whatever this grand trick is,

1399
01:09:34,434 --> 01:09:37,199
it was designed a long time ago.

1400
01:09:37,434 --> 01:09:41,962
And I believe that what's about to follow
is really going to amaze.

1401
01:09:42,794 --> 01:09:47,356
So I suggest
you sit back and enjoy your front row seat.

1402
01:09:47,794 --> 01:09:50,479
You paid quite a lot of good money for it.

1403
01:09:50,674 --> 01:09:52,722
Whatever you stand to make

1404
01:09:54,834 --> 01:09:58,395
I'll double it, if you expose them now.

1405
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:00,005
And destroy them.

1406
01:10:00,394 --> 01:10:02,396
I stand to make five million.

1407
01:10:03,114 --> 01:10:04,354
Am I flinching?

1408
01:10:06,474 --> 01:10:08,078
No, you're not.

1409
01:11:28,874 --> 01:11:30,000
Hey-

1410
01:11:31,354 --> 01:11:33,595
I'm sorry for your arm.

1411
01:11:33,674 --> 01:11:35,244
No. I'm sorry.

1412
01:11:35,314 --> 01:11:37,601
I was an asshole. I was drunk.

1413
01:11:39,554 --> 01:11:42,160
I'm at a loss.

1414
01:11:44,074 --> 01:11:49,478
You know, when Merritt said I hardly spent
any time away from the desk, he was right.

1415
01:11:49,554 --> 01:11:52,842
I'm a researcher. That's what I do best.

1416
01:11:53,954 --> 01:11:57,845
So what's this all about?

1417
01:11:58,554 --> 01:12:01,239
Supposedly, if you buy into it,

1418
01:12:01,314 --> 01:12:02,679
The Eye are the keepers

1419
01:12:02,754 --> 01:12:03,960
of real magic

1420
01:12:04,034 --> 01:12:06,958
and the protectors of those who practice it.

1421
01:12:07,034 --> 01:12:08,957
"Candidates for initiations

1422
01:12:09,034 --> 01:12:12,197
"must follow a series of commands
with blind obedience."

1423
01:12:13,194 --> 01:12:16,403
- This isn't real.
- But there are some who think it is.

1424
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:18,399
<i>May n</i>

1425
01:12:20,194 --> 01:12:24,518
According to this,
they only take new people twice a century.

1426
01:12:24,594 --> 01:12:27,996
So what? The Horsemen are doing
these shows in order to get into this thing?

1427
01:12:28,074 --> 01:12:29,314
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

1428
01:12:29,394 --> 01:12:34,400
I mean, I guess these guys
could just rob banks to rob banks.

1429
01:12:34,474 --> 01:12:36,795
They don't have to put on a show for that.

1430
01:12:36,874 --> 01:12:38,399
It's probably just a myth.

1431
01:12:38,474 --> 01:12:42,604
But it doesn't make any sense,
and I don't think logic will solve this for us.

1432
01:12:42,674 --> 01:12:45,280
- You don't say?
- No.

1433
01:12:46,514 --> 01:12:51,156
I believe
that some things are only discovered

1434
01:12:51,234 --> 01:12:55,637
if you take certain leaps.

1435
01:13:02,634 --> 01:13:05,763
- Well, I gotta get to...
- Yeah. Yeah.

1436
01:13:05,834 --> 01:13:07,996
- Thanks. Good night.
- Yeah. Good night.

1437
01:13:08,074 --> 01:13:09,883
- Sorry.
-It's all right.

1438
01:13:12,394 --> 01:13:15,841
If The Eye did exist, we'd have to assume
they were watching us, right?

1439
01:13:15,914 --> 01:13:17,200
Shit.

1440
01:13:17,274 --> 01:13:19,880
I think someone is watching us,
but it isn't magic.

1441
01:13:19,954 --> 01:13:22,958
Your fears are correct.
This is not and has never been your phone.

1442
01:13:23,034 --> 01:13:27,722
It's a clone in every way, except for this.

1443
01:13:27,834 --> 01:13:29,120
A bug.

1444
01:13:29,194 --> 01:13:33,040
Someone has
heard every call, read every text.

1445
01:13:33,274 --> 01:13:34,480
That's how
they were able to stay ahead of us.

1446
01:13:34,594 --> 01:13:35,436
God damn it!

1447
01:13:36,794 --> 01:13:38,603
Get me Atlas' interrogation tape.

1448
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,439
Yes, sir. I have it on the hard drive.

1449
01:13:42,274 --> 01:13:43,355
Picture's up.

1450
01:13:43,834 --> 01:13:45,598
Okay, fast forward.

1451
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:47,444
Go on, go on. Freeze!

1452
01:13:48,194 --> 01:13:50,003
Okay. Frame by frame. Go on.

1453
01:13:50,874 --> 01:13:51,921
Play it through.

1454
01:13:53,034 --> 01:13:55,355
Stop. Zoom in tighter. Tighter.

1455
01:13:55,794 --> 01:13:57,603
There. That's where he took my phone.

1456
01:13:58,874 --> 01:14:00,080
Is that thing transmitting?

1457
01:14:00,234 --> 01:14:01,645
Only when
you're making a call or sending a text.

1458
01:14:01,834 --> 01:14:02,801
Plus I removed the bug.

1459
01:14:02,874 --> 01:14:04,444
All right. Put it back in
and turn on the phone.

1460
01:14:04,674 --> 01:14:06,483
They don't know
that we know about the bug.

1461
01:14:06,674 --> 01:14:08,676
As of this instant, we are ahead of them.

1462
01:14:08,754 --> 01:14:10,916
We need to keep it that way. Understand?

1463
01:14:11,314 --> 01:14:12,645
Find my real phone and track it.

1464
01:14:12,754 --> 01:14:16,076
Already did. As of about 20 minutes ago,
it's in New York City.

1465
01:14:16,274 --> 01:14:17,321
Good.

1466
01:14:17,714 --> 01:14:19,398
I wanna cut 'em off at the knees.

1467
01:14:19,474 --> 01:14:20,600
They got power? Cut it.

1468
01:14:20,794 --> 01:14:24,082
They got phones, electricity, water? Cut it.

1469
01:14:24,274 --> 01:14:25,321
Squeeze 'em out.

1470
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:27,158
I want 'em to feel our presence.

1471
01:14:27,234 --> 01:14:28,759
And get me an airplane!

1472
01:14:31,514 --> 01:14:33,357
The firewall's down.
Do they know about this?

1473
01:14:33,434 --> 01:14:34,401
They who?

1474
01:14:34,474 --> 01:14:36,283
"They," "them," whoever we're working for.

1475
01:14:36,474 --> 01:14:37,635
Who are we working for?

1476
01:14:37,754 --> 01:14:39,836
And are we prepared to go to jail for them?

1477
01:14:39,914 --> 01:14:40,915
Stop being paranoid.

1478
01:14:41,154 --> 01:14:42,235
It really does happen.

1479
01:14:42,434 --> 01:14:44,038
It happened to you.
Doesn't mean it's gonna happen to us.

1480
01:14:44,154 --> 01:14:45,724
Guys, I don't know if can do this, all right.

1481
01:14:45,794 --> 01:14:47,125
I don't want to go to jail, you know?

1482
01:14:47,194 --> 01:14:49,003
Then don't screw up.
You're always talking about

1483
01:14:49,074 --> 01:14:50,280
wanting to be treated like an adult.

1484
01:14:50,354 --> 01:14:51,515
Now might be a good time
to start acting like one.

1485
01:14:51,594 --> 01:14:53,801
Stick to the plan. Stay here and burn it all.

1486
01:15:06,874 --> 01:15:08,080
I don't know what I'm doing here.

1487
01:15:08,274 --> 01:15:09,241
I don't know
what you would do anywhere else.

1488
01:15:09,314 --> 01:15:11,794
I'm here for the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

1489
01:15:12,114 --> 01:15:14,276
That's it. Then I'm gone.

1490
01:15:14,354 --> 01:15:16,516
You can do whatever you want
when this is over, Merritt.

1491
01:15:16,714 --> 01:15:18,842
But until then, you stick to the plan.

1492
01:15:18,914 --> 01:15:20,962
Hey, guys. They're here.

1493
01:15:22,794 --> 01:15:24,796
- My guys are ready to go.
- Let's do this quickly...

1494
01:15:24,874 --> 01:15:26,205
- No.
- What?

1495
01:15:26,274 --> 01:15:27,480
She doesn't have jurisdiction here.

1496
01:15:27,714 --> 01:15:29,000
She's Interpol. She's with me.

1497
01:15:29,074 --> 01:15:30,075
She stays.

1498
01:15:30,154 --> 01:15:31,440
What? What?

1499
01:15:31,514 --> 01:15:32,515
Stay in the car.

1500
01:15:34,794 --> 01:15:36,000
Let's go.

1501
01:15:41,634 --> 01:15:42,681
Okay. Let's do it.

1502
01:15:47,114 --> 01:15:48,115
FBI!

1503
01:15:52,394 --> 01:15:53,725
Ladies first.

1504
01:15:54,314 --> 01:15:55,520
Don't move!

1505
01:16:01,554 --> 01:16:02,999
Tell me.

1506
01:16:03,114 --> 01:16:04,843
Is my money being well-spent?

1507
01:16:05,354 --> 01:16:07,277
Exceedingly well.

1508
01:16:09,034 --> 01:16:10,524
Now you tell me,

1509
01:16:11,314 --> 01:16:12,998
how do you like your Horsemen?

1510
01:16:13,154 --> 01:16:15,202
Fricasseed or fried?

1511
01:16:15,434 --> 01:16:16,481
Shredded.

1512
01:16:17,554 --> 01:16:19,044
I'll tell the Chef.

1513
01:17:34,594 --> 01:17:35,595
Freeze!

1514
01:17:42,794 --> 01:17:43,795
Dylan!

1515
01:17:44,754 --> 01:17:45,915
Hold on!

1516
01:17:48,234 --> 01:17:49,281
You little...

1517
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:54,795
Come here!

1518
01:17:56,554 --> 01:17:58,477
Five is clear. Standing by for six.

1519
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,915
You little shit!

1520
01:18:00,994 --> 01:18:03,235
- What game are you playing?
- What game are you playing?

1521
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:05,602
We're all good at six. Move to seven.

1522
01:18:05,674 --> 01:18:07,722
Copy that. Going to seven. Go, go, go!

1523
01:18:08,394 --> 01:18:10,396
No, no, no, no, no. Go back!

1524
01:18:10,954 --> 01:18:12,115
Hey!

1525
01:18:13,834 --> 01:18:15,074
Come here!

1526
01:18:46,074 --> 01:18:47,235
Come here!

1527
01:18:47,314 --> 01:18:48,998
All right, hold on, hold on!

1528
01:18:50,914 --> 01:18:52,757
- Really?
- Yup.

1529
01:18:56,954 --> 01:18:57,955
You...

1530
01:19:01,754 --> 01:19:03,244
You little...

1531
01:19:19,274 --> 01:19:20,321
Shit!

1532
01:19:38,714 --> 01:19:39,761
Shit!

1533
01:19:41,154 --> 01:19:42,519
Give me that!

1534
01:20:08,514 --> 01:20:10,482
<i>All units, cover the north exit now!</i>

1535
01:20:10,554 --> 01:20:11,840
Clear on Evan.

1536
01:20:11,914 --> 01:20:13,757
<i>Block every possible exit.</i>

1537
01:20:13,834 --> 01:20:15,359
Hey! Get back. Shit.

1538
01:20:16,834 --> 01:20:18,996
- FBI. Sort of. I need your car. Thanks.
- What?

1539
01:20:19,074 --> 01:20:20,075
What?

1540
01:20:22,194 --> 01:20:23,798
Stop! Stop!

1541
01:20:39,954 --> 01:20:41,001
Hey!

1542
01:21:10,834 --> 01:21:11,756
Good. Follow him!

1543
01:21:11,874 --> 01:21:13,922
Don't ever tell me to stay in the car. Ever.

1544
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:15,325
I didn't have tactical command.

1545
01:21:15,394 --> 01:21:17,795
If you don't trust me, just tell me.

1546
01:21:17,874 --> 01:21:19,444
Promise me, next time, you will back me up.

1547
01:21:19,554 --> 01:21:21,602
Could we have
this conversation later, please?

1548
01:21:21,674 --> 01:21:23,244
No!

1549
01:21:23,314 --> 01:21:25,601
Okay, fine, I promise. Now, go!

1550
01:21:33,034 --> 01:21:35,560
- Where'd they go?
- Where are they?

1551
01:21:35,634 --> 01:21:37,318
I don't know. She just took some guy's car.

1552
01:21:37,394 --> 01:21:38,839
- Where are they?
- That way. That way.

1553
01:21:38,914 --> 01:21:39,961
- Is that your car?
- Yeah.

1554
01:21:40,074 --> 01:21:41,519
Let's go.

1555
01:22:07,114 --> 01:22:08,115
There he is!

1556
01:22:19,994 --> 01:22:20,995
Move!

1557
01:22:25,394 --> 01:22:26,441
Left!

1558
01:22:28,754 --> 01:22:30,563
We're heading east on the FDR Drive.

1559
01:22:30,634 --> 01:22:32,477
- This is not east.
- North! North!

1560
01:22:32,554 --> 01:22:34,602
- We're heading north on the FDR Drive.
- What?

1561
01:22:34,714 --> 01:22:36,796
<i>We're coming to you live above the FDR,</i>

1562
01:22:36,874 --> 01:22:39,798
<i>where NYPD
and federal agents, as you now see,</i>

1563
01:22:39,874 --> 01:22:41,797
<i>are engaged in a high-speed pursuit,</i>

1564
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:43,114
<i>following a black sedan.</i>

1565
01:22:48,274 --> 01:22:49,275
<i>Fuller, where are you?</i>

1566
01:22:49,554 --> 01:22:51,363
Right here. Trying to catch up to you now.

1567
01:22:51,434 --> 01:22:53,482
<i>We're now trying to get you a better shot.</i>

1568
01:22:55,954 --> 01:22:57,035
Come on!

1569
01:23:12,834 --> 01:23:13,960
<i>It looks like they're turning</i>

1570
01:23:14,034 --> 01:23:16,162
<i>onto the 59th Street Bridge.</i>

1571
01:23:18,194 --> 01:23:19,798
<i>As soon as we have them within range,</i>

1572
01:23:19,874 --> 01:23:21,717
<i>we will bring you those pictures live.</i>

1573
01:23:27,194 --> 01:23:28,434
Good. Just stay with him.

1574
01:23:35,794 --> 01:23:37,034
Go, go, go!

1575
01:23:41,034 --> 01:23:42,604
Behind... You're behind the bus!

1576
01:23:46,194 --> 01:23:47,241
Get over!

1577
01:23:50,794 --> 01:23:51,875
Oh, shit!

1578
01:24:15,554 --> 01:24:16,555
Come here!

1579
01:24:17,794 --> 01:24:19,239
Get back! Get back!

1580
01:24:20,714 --> 01:24:22,000
Dylan, let's go, man!

1581
01:24:22,234 --> 01:24:23,235
Come on, you...

1582
01:24:24,714 --> 01:24:26,762
- Come on, man! Get out!
- He's gonna die in here.

1583
01:24:26,834 --> 01:24:28,245
Leave him! There's nothing you can do!

1584
01:24:28,314 --> 01:24:30,237
Let's go! Leave him!

1585
01:24:35,034 --> 01:24:36,399
'The Paper!
- Dylan!

1586
01:24:36,634 --> 01:24:38,557
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

1587
01:25:03,754 --> 01:25:07,998
<i>Today, the unfolding story of a popular
and controversial group of magicians,</i>

1588
01:25:08,114 --> 01:25:10,116
<i>who have been fast capturing
the public's imagination,</i>

1589
01:25:10,194 --> 01:25:13,516
<i>took a dark turn when a police action
that began in Chinatown</i>

1590
01:25:13,594 --> 01:25:17,394
<i>developed into a dramatic, high-speed
chase across the 59th Street Bridge,</i>

1591
01:25:17,474 --> 01:25:20,444
<i>which caused a fatal collision
that took the life of Jack Wilder,</i>

1592
01:25:20,514 --> 01:25:22,835
<i>one of the so-called Four Horsemen.</i>

1593
01:25:24,034 --> 01:25:28,119
<i>The whereabouts of the other three
Horsemen remain unknown at this time.</i>

1594
01:25:32,994 --> 01:25:35,679
Dylan, they just
figured out what the paper was in Jack's car.

1595
01:25:35,754 --> 01:25:37,040
So they know what it is?

1596
01:25:37,114 --> 01:25:38,843
And why the kid died trying to protect it.

1597
01:25:38,914 --> 01:25:40,598
Evans is on his way to brief us right now.

1598
01:25:40,674 --> 01:25:42,244
Let's go.

1599
01:25:42,314 --> 01:25:43,600
You're gonna wanna take this first, though.

1600
01:25:43,674 --> 01:25:44,675
What's that?

1601
01:25:44,754 --> 01:25:47,041
Your friend Thaddeus Bradley.

1602
01:25:47,554 --> 01:25:48,794
Rhodes.

1603
01:25:48,874 --> 01:25:50,524
You do understand the function

1604
01:25:50,594 --> 01:25:52,722
of the magician's assistant,
don't you, Agent Rhodes?

1605
01:25:53,074 --> 01:25:54,519
Yeah, she's there to distract them

1606
01:25:54,594 --> 01:25:55,800
while he sets up the trick.

1607
01:25:57,074 --> 01:25:59,236
You'd be right if you weren't so wrong.

1608
01:25:59,634 --> 01:26:01,398
<i>While you're watching the magician,</i>

1609
01:26:02,234 --> 01:26:04,475
<i>that lovely innocent
is actually pulling the strings.</i>

1610
01:26:04,714 --> 01:26:07,843
<i>Don't you find it peculiar
that Interpol would send you</i>

1611
01:26:07,914 --> 01:26:11,361
a first timer off the desk
to be your assistant?

1612
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:13,996
Why did she request to be put on the case?

1613
01:26:14,394 --> 01:26:16,317
She was assigned to the case.

1614
01:26:17,194 --> 01:26:18,605
Luck of the draw.

1615
01:26:19,154 --> 01:26:22,283
Like choosing a random card in the deck.

1616
01:26:22,434 --> 01:26:25,995
I find it odd, your sudden act of generosity.

1617
01:26:26,074 --> 01:26:27,235
What's in it for you?

1618
01:26:27,394 --> 01:26:29,237
Just trying to even the game.

1619
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:33,439
I feel like I'm playing with somebody
wearing ankle weights and flippers.

1620
01:26:34,594 --> 01:26:38,360
Keep up, Agent Rhodes. Keep up.

1621
01:26:42,194 --> 01:26:43,275
Hey-

1622
01:26:43,554 --> 01:26:44,794
We got a problem.

1623
01:26:45,954 --> 01:26:47,035
Here's the safe.

1624
01:26:47,114 --> 01:26:48,559
No, no, no. Hey.

1625
01:26:48,674 --> 01:26:49,960
What's he doing here?

1626
01:26:50,114 --> 01:26:51,718
Giving us our first solid lead.

1627
01:26:51,794 --> 01:26:53,683
We've been investigating
a private security contractor

1628
01:26:53,754 --> 01:26:54,915
called Elkhorn

1629
01:26:54,994 --> 01:26:56,962
-for the last five years.
- And?

1630
01:26:57,034 --> 01:26:58,718
They've been hiding close
to a half billion dollars...

1631
01:26:58,794 --> 01:27:01,240
I didn't ask you. I asked him.

1632
01:27:01,634 --> 01:27:03,955
The money's in a vault inside
a warehouse in Queens.

1633
01:27:04,114 --> 01:27:06,640
We think this vault
is your magicians' final target.

1634
01:27:06,794 --> 01:27:08,717
The magician who died on the bridge...

1635
01:27:08,794 --> 01:27:12,276
You pulled our classified Elkhorn file
right from his crispy little hand.

1636
01:27:12,634 --> 01:27:14,636
And despite their bullshit
Robin Hood razzle-dazzle,

1637
01:27:14,914 --> 01:27:16,803
your magicians are nothing
more than common thieves.

1638
01:27:16,874 --> 01:27:18,114
How did they get the file?

1639
01:27:19,394 --> 01:27:20,395
This is the part you're gonna find

1640
01:27:20,474 --> 01:27:22,442
particularly interesting, Agent Rhodes.

1641
01:27:22,634 --> 01:27:24,955
They patched to my server
after they accessed

1642
01:27:25,034 --> 01:27:27,321
your mobile command center
in New Orleans

1643
01:27:27,394 --> 01:27:28,998
with codes they got from your phone.

1644
01:27:31,154 --> 01:27:32,997
You ordered us all out to chase after them.

1645
01:27:33,394 --> 01:27:36,000
The level of incompetence
displayed on this case,

1646
01:27:36,074 --> 01:27:38,600
that's a magic trick in and of itself.

1647
01:27:38,674 --> 01:27:40,915
Abracadabra. I'm taking over.

1648
01:27:42,354 --> 01:27:44,243
Boss, he's taking over?

1649
01:27:44,794 --> 01:27:46,796
Let's go, gentlemen.

1650
01:27:48,154 --> 01:27:49,565
Hey-

1651
01:27:49,634 --> 01:27:51,079
Hey. I want to have a word with you.

1652
01:27:51,194 --> 01:27:52,355
Don't ever talk to me like that again.

1653
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:54,482
- Why the hell did you take this case?
- What?

1654
01:27:54,554 --> 01:27:56,716
People say I'm "hard to read."
That's an American expression.

1655
01:27:56,794 --> 01:27:58,239
Do you understand it?

1656
01:27:58,314 --> 01:27:59,361
Yes.

1657
01:27:59,474 --> 01:28:01,715
Good, then let me make myself
perfectly clear to you.

1658
01:28:01,794 --> 01:28:04,195
If I find out that you are anything other than

1659
01:28:04,274 --> 01:28:05,560
who you say you are, I swear...

1660
01:28:05,674 --> 01:28:07,483
And we French also have an expression.

1661
01:28:09,314 --> 01:28:10,998
"Faith can move mountains."

1662
01:28:11,074 --> 01:28:12,758
If we hope to capture The Horsemen,

1663
01:28:12,834 --> 01:28:14,677
then you need to have a little faith in me.

1664
01:28:14,914 --> 01:28:16,916
Because I've done nothing
to deserve otherwise.

1665
01:28:16,994 --> 01:28:19,759
I just got my ass handed to me.

1666
01:28:19,834 --> 01:28:21,359
I am losing this case.

1667
01:28:21,474 --> 01:28:24,796
So faith is a luxury
I don't have any time for right now.

1668
01:28:30,994 --> 01:28:33,235
<i>More than anything in his life,</i>

1669
01:28:33,314 --> 01:28:38,684
Jack wanted to be
the most famous magician who ever lived.

1670
01:28:38,754 --> 01:28:40,165
And I can't say he achieved it,

1671
01:28:40,234 --> 01:28:44,205
but I do hope wherever he is,
it is full of magic.

1672
01:28:45,954 --> 01:28:48,275
But the point is... Sorry.

1673
01:28:48,354 --> 01:28:49,844
The point is...

1674
01:28:49,914 --> 01:28:56,115
The point of why we are here is to say
that we are not... We cannot quit now.

1675
01:28:56,194 --> 01:28:58,765
<i>We've started something
bigger than all of us.</i>

1676
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:00,677
<i>We have to finish it.</i>

1677
01:29:09,714 --> 01:29:10,795
<i>Approaching the warehouse.</i>

1678
01:29:10,874 --> 01:29:13,400
<i>Units 5 and 6
cover the north and south entrances.</i>

1679
01:29:13,474 --> 01:29:14,714
<i>We are going for the vault.</i>

1680
01:29:19,794 --> 01:29:22,718
Hey. Where's the safe? Where's the safe?

1681
01:29:26,914 --> 01:29:27,915
What is this?

1682
01:29:27,994 --> 01:29:29,359
Where the hell is the goddamn safe?

1683
01:29:29,434 --> 01:29:31,323
We just moved it while you were outside.

1684
01:29:31,394 --> 01:29:32,555
- Evans' orders.
- What?

1685
01:29:32,634 --> 01:29:33,715
I never said that.

1686
01:29:33,794 --> 01:29:35,125
Sir, you got a phone call

1687
01:29:35,234 --> 01:29:36,838
and said Washington wants the safe moved.

1688
01:29:36,914 --> 01:29:38,996
You never heard that
come out of my mouth, Agent.

1689
01:29:39,074 --> 01:29:39,757
What happened?

1690
01:29:40,274 --> 01:29:42,561
You tell me what's going on,
because this is bullshit!

1691
01:29:42,634 --> 01:29:43,715
No!

1692
01:29:49,594 --> 01:29:51,084
Jesus Christ.

1693
01:29:51,314 --> 01:29:54,284
Sir? Sir? What are you doing?

1694
01:29:54,354 --> 01:29:56,243
I think it's Beethoven's Concerto in D-Major.

1695
01:29:56,314 --> 01:29:57,315
Where's the safe?

1696
01:29:57,394 --> 01:29:58,475
His team is loading the truck.

1697
01:30:02,754 --> 01:30:04,438
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

1698
01:30:05,994 --> 01:30:07,155
- Stop the truck!
- Stop!

1699
01:30:08,154 --> 01:30:10,316
- Stop!
- Hey! Stop that truck!

1700
01:30:18,954 --> 01:30:20,843
What the hell's going on?
We got our orders.

1701
01:30:20,914 --> 01:30:22,678
Now you've got new orders. Open it up.

1702
01:30:26,634 --> 01:30:28,443
Okay. Here's what I want.

1703
01:30:28,514 --> 01:30:30,755
At this moment,
they think that safe's leaving this site.

1704
01:30:30,994 --> 01:30:32,120
So we stay with it.

1705
01:30:32,194 --> 01:30:34,117
We follow it
all the way to... Where's it going?

1706
01:30:34,394 --> 01:30:35,475
5 Pointz. Up the street.

1707
01:30:35,914 --> 01:30:38,804
So we go to 5 Pointz.
Wherever the safe goes, we go.

1708
01:30:38,994 --> 01:30:40,120
It'll lead us right to 'em.

1709
01:30:40,994 --> 01:30:42,200
You two are with me.

1710
01:30:54,834 --> 01:30:56,074
Guys.

1711
01:30:57,034 --> 01:30:59,514
Look. Office just called with this.

1712
01:30:59,634 --> 01:31:01,477
Horsemen posted it to YouTube
20 minutes ago.

1713
01:31:01,874 --> 01:31:05,481
<i>The point of why we're here

1714
01:31:05,714 --> 01:31:07,557

<i>We've started something

1716
01:31:10,394 --> 01:31:11,964

<i>Remember the name Jack Wilder

1718
01:31:14,674 --> 01:31:16,563
<i>5 Pointz, Queens, 7:00.</i>

1719
01:31:16,794 --> 01:31:17,875
Their show is in a half an hour.

1720
01:31:17,954 --> 01:31:19,240
It's exactly where we're headed.

1721
01:31:19,394 --> 01:31:21,522
I don't know, boss.
I don't wanna be the naysayer,

1722
01:31:21,714 --> 01:31:23,682
but these guys are kinda tricky.

1723
01:31:23,754 --> 01:31:26,405
Rhodes, they're entertainers.

1724
01:31:28,914 --> 01:31:31,076
<i>A stunning turnout here in 5 Pointz</i>

1725
01:31:31,154 --> 01:31:35,000
<i>as the renegade Horsemen
taunt the FBI into a final showdown.</i>

1726
01:31:35,074 --> 01:31:36,485
<i>The Horsemen have invited
us to their final round</i>

1727
01:31:36,554 --> 01:31:38,761
<i>of their three-act face-off with the FBI.</i>

1728
01:31:39,234 --> 01:31:42,602
<i>What do they have in store?
We're about to find out.</i>

1729
01:31:53,914 --> 01:31:56,155
<i>AH eyes on the truck.
Let's see who approaches.</i>

1730
01:31:56,274 --> 01:31:57,605
Copy that.

1731
01:32:13,754 --> 01:32:15,597
<i>Agents Rhodes, Fuller?</i>

1732
01:32:16,274 --> 01:32:17,275
Go, for us.

1733
01:32:17,434 --> 01:32:20,085
We've got movement.
Someone's walking toward the truck.

1734
01:32:20,194 --> 01:32:21,684
<i>It's a woman.</i>

1735
01:32:25,394 --> 01:32:26,600
- Freeze!
- Oh, shit!

1736
01:32:28,354 --> 01:32:29,879
What the hell's going on?

1737
01:32:30,954 --> 01:32:33,275
Hey! It's the guy from the TV.

1738
01:32:33,394 --> 01:32:34,441
Put your guns down.

1739
01:32:34,634 --> 01:32:37,478
Look who it is. The fifth Horseman.

1740
01:32:37,634 --> 01:32:38,635
Are you kidding?

1741
01:32:38,714 --> 01:32:40,557
I'm following them, just like you are.

1742
01:32:40,634 --> 01:32:42,238
I'm not following anybody anymore.

1743
01:32:42,314 --> 01:32:44,043
You've been ahead of us this whole time.

1744
01:32:44,154 --> 01:32:45,758
But guess what? I'm ahead of you now.

1745
01:32:45,954 --> 01:32:47,604
Your ass is mine.

1746
01:32:47,794 --> 01:32:49,558
You guys are still idiots.

1747
01:32:49,754 --> 01:32:50,801
Yeah?

1748
01:32:50,874 --> 01:32:52,000
This happens to be the former

1749
01:32:52,114 --> 01:32:54,162
rehearsal space for Lionel Shrike.

1750
01:32:54,594 --> 01:32:56,437
It's where I did my first show.

1751
01:32:56,634 --> 01:32:59,444
Now, if you wanna look
like even bigger idiots,

1752
01:32:59,634 --> 01:33:00,920
why not open it?

1753
01:33:01,274 --> 01:33:02,924
And while you're doing it, Agent Rhodes,

1754
01:33:03,194 --> 01:33:04,844
would you mind reenacting your look

1755
01:33:05,034 --> 01:33:06,957
of absolute befuddlement for me?

1756
01:33:07,114 --> 01:33:09,196
It will make a wonderful cover for my DVD.

1757
01:33:10,554 --> 01:33:11,794
Open the safe.

1758
01:33:11,874 --> 01:33:13,364
- Go ahead.
- Open it.

1759
01:33:17,714 --> 01:33:18,761
What the hell?

1760
01:33:21,154 --> 01:33:22,280
What?

1761
01:33:22,514 --> 01:33:23,595
Give me that.

1762
01:33:23,794 --> 01:33:24,841
No.

1763
01:33:24,994 --> 01:33:25,995
No!

1764
01:33:30,634 --> 01:33:31,681
What is this?

1765
01:33:32,794 --> 01:33:33,795
Get back!

1766
01:33:41,394 --> 01:33:43,522
Who doesn't love a good magic trick?

1767
01:33:44,194 --> 01:33:46,515
They have you chasing empty safes again.

1768
01:33:47,874 --> 01:33:51,037
Once again, misdirection.

1769
01:33:57,994 --> 01:33:59,644
The show is starting. Move out!

1770
01:33:59,714 --> 01:34:02,240
The question
I'd be asking now, Agent Rhodes is,

1771
01:34:02,714 --> 01:34:04,842
"What happened to the real one?"

1772
01:34:25,474 --> 01:34:27,238
Clear! Clear 'em out!

1773
01:34:27,314 --> 01:34:28,918
Come on. Move 'em out.
Move 'em out of the way.

1774
01:34:30,314 --> 01:34:32,203
FBI! Give me a path!

1775
01:34:32,834 --> 01:34:34,404
Clear out! Clear out!

1776
01:34:34,674 --> 01:34:36,039
<i>What is magic?</i>

1777
01:34:36,874 --> 01:34:37,921
<i>Magic is deception.</i>

1778
01:34:38,034 --> 01:34:39,763
<i>But deception designed to delight,</i>

1779
01:34:39,994 --> 01:34:41,678
<i>to entertain, to inspire.</i>

1780
01:34:41,874 --> 01:34:44,241
Look out! Clear! Clear! Look out!

1781
01:34:44,594 --> 01:34:45,675
<i>It is about belief.</i>

1782
01:34:45,754 --> 01:34:46,755
<i>Faith.</i>

1783
01:34:46,874 --> 01:34:47,875
<i>Trust.</i>

1784
01:34:51,874 --> 01:34:53,285
<i>Without those qualities,</i>

1785
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:56,756
<i>magic, as an art form,
would no longer exist.</i>

1786
01:34:57,354 --> 01:34:59,197
<i>But what happens if these qualities</i>

1787
01:34:59,394 --> 01:35:01,362
<i>are not used for their higher purpose?</i>

1788
01:35:01,554 --> 01:35:04,364
<i>And instead they're used to cheat, lie.</i>

1789
01:35:04,554 --> 01:35:06,795
<i>For personal gain or for greed.</i>

1790
01:35:06,954 --> 01:35:08,604
<i>Then it's no longer magic.</i>

1791
01:35:08,794 --> 01:35:09,875
<i>It's crime.</i>

1792
01:35:10,074 --> 01:35:13,078
<i>So tonight, for our final act,</i>

1793
01:35:13,154 --> 01:35:15,998
<i>you're gonna help us set a few things right.</i>

1794
01:35:20,114 --> 01:35:21,275
What's going on here, Rhodes?

1795
01:35:21,554 --> 01:35:22,715
I don't know.

1796
01:35:23,794 --> 01:35:24,955
Showtime.

1797
01:35:30,154 --> 01:35:31,155
Look!

1798
01:35:35,474 --> 01:35:37,397
There they are on the roof. Let's move!

1799
01:35:37,474 --> 01:35:38,760
Go, go, go!

1800
01:35:39,474 --> 01:35:40,805
- Dylan!
- FBI, coming through!

1801
01:35:42,394 --> 01:35:43,441
What are you doing here?

1802
01:35:43,554 --> 01:35:44,635
They're going in the wrong direction

1803
01:35:44,794 --> 01:35:45,841
and you know it.

1804
01:35:46,114 --> 01:35:48,435
Rhodes! I need all personnel now!

1805
01:35:48,554 --> 01:35:51,922
You need to trust me.
Take your leap of faith.

1806
01:35:52,754 --> 01:35:53,835
Wait.

1807
01:35:54,114 --> 01:35:55,275
I'm going to go with her.

1808
01:35:55,434 --> 01:35:56,720
Go. I got your back. I'll be right here.

1809
01:35:58,554 --> 01:35:59,601
Go ahead!

1810
01:35:59,674 --> 01:36:01,164
That's on you, Fuller.

1811
01:36:16,554 --> 01:36:20,604
Let's go, let's go! Now, now, now!

1812
01:36:31,714 --> 01:36:32,795
Daniel?

1813
01:36:33,634 --> 01:36:34,795
Yeah?

1814
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:39,556
As our, let's call it,
year of living dangerously

1815
01:36:39,754 --> 01:36:43,076
comes to a close,
in a rare moment of vulnerability,

1816
01:36:43,274 --> 01:36:45,959
I'd like to express a sentiment

1817
01:36:46,034 --> 01:36:47,638
to you about our relationship.

1818
01:36:47,874 --> 01:36:48,921
Okay.

1819
01:36:49,314 --> 01:36:52,796
Well, when I first met you,
I thought you were kind of a

1820
01:36:54,634 --> 01:36:55,635
dick.

1821
01:36:57,154 --> 01:36:58,201
And?

1822
01:36:59,994 --> 01:37:01,644
No, that's it.

1823
01:37:01,874 --> 01:37:02,921
That's very nice.

1824
01:37:02,994 --> 01:37:04,484
- Yeah.
- I'm touched.

1825
01:37:04,634 --> 01:37:06,124
Yeah. Just from the heart.

1826
01:37:06,314 --> 01:37:07,918
Well, I didn't tell you where I was touched.

1827
01:37:08,034 --> 01:37:09,081
Oh. you!

1828
01:37:12,674 --> 01:37:14,324
Oh, God.
What are we gonna do when this is over?

1829
01:37:14,554 --> 01:37:15,680
We're on our own.

1830
01:37:15,754 --> 01:37:17,404
Our instructions run out after the show.

1831
01:37:18,314 --> 01:37:20,203
Even if there is no "Eye,"

1832
01:37:20,274 --> 01:37:22,003
if we were completely played and we spend

1833
01:37:22,114 --> 01:37:24,116
the next 20 years in jail, then,

1834
01:37:24,674 --> 01:37:26,358
I just want to say that...

1835
01:37:26,594 --> 01:37:28,961
I know. Me, too.

1836
01:37:30,314 --> 01:37:32,237
Little too sentimental for me.

1837
01:37:39,194 --> 01:37:40,275
There they are!

1838
01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:46,039
Go grab 'em! Put 'em down! Go, go, go!

1839
01:37:46,154 --> 01:37:47,155
Grab 'em!

1840
01:37:52,154 --> 01:37:53,201
Get up!

1841
01:37:53,634 --> 01:37:54,840
What the hell?

1842
01:37:58,634 --> 01:37:59,795
Shit!

1843
01:38:08,994 --> 01:38:10,234
Hello, New York!

1844
01:38:18,714 --> 01:38:20,682
Thank you for the magic.

1845
01:38:20,874 --> 01:38:21,955
And thank you for being such

1846
01:38:22,074 --> 01:38:25,078
an incredible and dedicated audience.

1847
01:38:25,474 --> 01:38:27,476
Unfortunately, like all good things,

1848
01:38:27,554 --> 01:38:29,363
it must come to an end.

1849
01:38:32,074 --> 01:38:34,554
So we would like to start our show tonight...

1850
01:38:34,634 --> 01:38:36,204
By saying goodbye.

1851
01:38:37,554 --> 01:38:38,919
All we wanted was to

1852
01:38:38,994 --> 01:38:40,962
bring the world to a magic show.

1853
01:38:41,034 --> 01:38:42,524
And thereby bring a little magic

1854
01:38:42,594 --> 01:38:43,755
back to the world.

1855
01:38:47,754 --> 01:38:48,915
Clear the way!

1856
01:38:58,674 --> 01:39:01,883
This has been
one hell of a ride for all of us.

1857
01:39:02,434 --> 01:39:04,755
But it's time for us to disappear.

1858
01:39:04,914 --> 01:39:06,279
Good night, New York.

1859
01:39:06,514 --> 01:39:07,959
And thank you for believing in us.

1860
01:39:10,594 --> 01:39:11,720
Stop!

1861
01:39:15,234 --> 01:39:16,235
Freeze!

1862
01:39:16,634 --> 01:39:17,840
No!

1863
01:39:35,914 --> 01:39:37,245
God damn it!

1864
01:40:05,834 --> 01:40:07,040
I'm sorry.

1865
01:40:07,714 --> 01:40:09,716
You were right. It's bigger than all of us.

1866
01:40:10,674 --> 01:40:14,759
This is one time I'm not happy being right.

1867
01:40:17,074 --> 01:40:18,724
So I guess this is it.

1868
01:40:20,754 --> 01:40:21,915
Is it?

1869
01:40:48,034 --> 01:40:49,320
Dylan!

1870
01:40:49,714 --> 01:40:52,160
Dylan! Dylan!

1871
01:40:52,234 --> 01:40:53,281
Hey-

1872
01:40:54,634 --> 01:40:56,602
- You see that?
- What?

1873
01:41:00,234 --> 01:41:01,599
Where's the real money?

1874
01:41:17,834 --> 01:41:21,805
You're under arrest! Hands in the air! Now!

1875
01:42:12,994 --> 01:42:14,120
I've been framed.

1876
01:42:15,474 --> 01:42:16,521
I'm sure you were.

1877
01:42:16,594 --> 01:42:17,880
Yeah, but I can prove it.

1878
01:42:18,394 --> 01:42:19,634
I always do.

1879
01:42:19,994 --> 01:42:21,962
Just like I predicted that you'd play the fool.

1880
01:42:22,034 --> 01:42:24,560
Let's just drop the theatricality, all right?

1881
01:42:24,794 --> 01:42:26,956
The cameras aren't rolling in here.

1882
01:42:27,194 --> 01:42:29,674
Fellas, can I have a few minutes
with my friend here alone, please.

1883
01:42:29,754 --> 01:42:31,597
Sure.

1884
01:42:36,554 --> 01:42:37,601
All right.

1885
01:42:38,634 --> 01:42:40,284
I got information to trade.

1886
01:42:40,394 --> 01:42:41,555
I believe that's how it's done. Huh?

1887
01:42:41,794 --> 01:42:43,398
If it's of some value.

1888
01:42:45,874 --> 01:42:49,037
These bars give a man time to think.

1889
01:42:50,234 --> 01:42:53,522
And I'm pretty sure I know how they did it.

1890
01:42:53,954 --> 01:42:56,082
<i>Remember the rabbit trick
in the second show?</i>

1891
01:42:57,234 --> 01:42:59,077
<i>The box was never empty.</i>

1892
01:43:01,434 --> 01:43:02,595
<i>The room wasn't either.</i>

1893
01:43:03,874 --> 01:43:06,275
<i>After gaining access to the warehouse,</i>

1894
01:43:06,594 --> 01:43:08,676
<i>The Horsemen left the real safe</i>

1895
01:43:08,754 --> 01:43:11,200
<i>and transformed the whole room</i>

1896
01:43:11,274 --> 01:43:13,754
<i>into a giant rabbit box.</i>

1897
01:43:15,354 --> 01:43:17,516
<i>You go charging in there,</i>

1898
01:43:17,754 --> 01:43:20,200
<i>thinking the safe was already gone.</i>

1899
01:43:20,434 --> 01:43:21,401
Hey!

1900
01:43:21,474 --> 01:43:22,805
Hey! Stop!

1901
01:43:22,994 --> 01:43:24,405
Missing the trick. Again.

1902
01:43:24,474 --> 01:43:25,521
Which was to make you think

1903
01:43:25,794 --> 01:43:27,319
the safe had already been stolen,

1904
01:43:27,394 --> 01:43:29,635
so you'd drop your guard and leave.

1905
01:43:30,194 --> 01:43:33,164
<i>Now, while you were busy
playing with balloon animals,</i>

1906
01:43:33,354 --> 01:43:35,960
<i>someone was breaking into the warehouse.</i>

1907
01:43:54,474 --> 01:43:55,635
<i>Who?</i>

1908
01:43:57,074 --> 01:43:58,564
<i>Jack Wilder.</i>

1909
01:43:59,314 --> 01:44:00,645
Holy shit.

1910
01:44:00,834 --> 01:44:03,235
No. No way. He died
right in front of my eyes.

1911
01:44:04,034 --> 01:44:06,162
Unless, of course, he didn't.

1912
01:44:13,474 --> 01:44:14,760
It's locked.

1913
01:44:15,554 --> 01:44:16,760
Weren't you listening?

1914
01:44:17,234 --> 01:44:18,315
Nothing's ever locked.

1915
01:44:19,714 --> 01:44:22,524
Well done, Mr. Wilder! Good work.

1916
01:44:22,674 --> 01:44:24,517
You're a big boy now, Jack.

1917
01:44:24,674 --> 01:44:27,041
He escaped in a standard FBI vehicle, right?

1918
01:44:30,834 --> 01:44:32,199
<i>Led you to the bridge.</i>

1919
01:44:32,434 --> 01:44:34,038
<i>Where the other Horsemen were waiting</i>

1920
01:44:34,194 --> 01:44:36,083
<i>with an identical replacement car.</i>

1921
01:44:37,074 --> 01:44:38,075
<i>It only took a split second</i>

1922
01:44:38,194 --> 01:44:39,161
<i>for you to lose contact with it</i>

1923
01:44:39,234 --> 01:44:40,235
<i>and make the switch.</i>

1924
01:45:02,554 --> 01:45:05,558
<i>When you crawled into that burning car,</i>

1925
01:45:05,914 --> 01:45:07,916
<i>quite heroically, I might add,</i>

1926
01:45:09,794 --> 01:45:11,876
<i>you almost died trying to rescue</i>

1927
01:45:11,954 --> 01:45:14,958
<i>what I assume was
a cadaver from the morgue.</i>

1928
01:45:16,474 --> 01:45:20,160
<i>Why go through
such an elaborate and dangerous plan</i>

1929
01:45:20,874 --> 01:45:22,399
just to frame one guy?

1930
01:45:22,714 --> 01:45:23,761
I don't know.

1931
01:45:23,914 --> 01:45:25,325
They never kept any of the money they took.

1932
01:45:25,394 --> 01:45:27,840
Yeah, that's the part
I haven't been able to put together yet.

1933
01:45:27,914 --> 01:45:30,599
But I just gave you information that
is substantially more important.

1934
01:45:30,754 --> 01:45:32,438
- No. Not really.
- What?

1935
01:45:32,514 --> 01:45:37,076
I finally got a chance to
really look into Lionel Shrike.

1936
01:45:37,354 --> 01:45:40,119
His comeback attempt. His accident.

1937
01:45:41,074 --> 01:45:44,601
The insurer who denied the family's claim?

1938
01:45:44,794 --> 01:45:46,000
Tressler Insurance.

1939
01:45:47,914 --> 01:45:50,155
The bank that carried the note?

1940
01:45:51,274 --> 01:45:52,924
Credit Republican of Paris.

1941
01:45:53,114 --> 01:45:54,764
Credit Republicain de Paris.

1942
01:45:56,114 --> 01:45:57,525
What do you make of that?

1943
01:45:57,594 --> 01:45:59,756
A sucker is born every minute.

1944
01:46:00,514 --> 01:46:03,120
What if all this was just leading up to

1945
01:46:03,194 --> 01:46:05,925
us getting mugged
in Central Park at 2:00 a.m.?

1946
01:46:05,994 --> 01:46:08,679
No, I'm telling you,
we're right where we need to be.

1947
01:46:08,754 --> 01:46:09,880
We just have to find...

1948
01:46:09,954 --> 01:46:11,080
That?

1949
01:46:13,594 --> 01:46:15,323
The Lionel Shrike tree.

1950
01:46:16,274 --> 01:46:18,800
And the card encased in glass.

1951
01:46:20,114 --> 01:46:21,764
What do we do now?

1952
01:46:38,394 --> 01:46:39,839
Oh, nice!

1953
01:46:55,714 --> 01:46:57,159
<i>So, here's my new theory.</i>

1954
01:46:57,674 --> 01:47:01,076
The legend is that the "Eye" is everywhere.

1955
01:47:01,754 --> 01:47:02,915
Waiting

1956
01:47:03,314 --> 01:47:07,080
for the truly great magicians
to distinguish themselves

1957
01:47:08,034 --> 01:47:09,843
from the mediocre ones.

1958
01:47:10,674 --> 01:47:11,880
Maybe that was you.

1959
01:47:12,514 --> 01:47:14,755
Deep down inside
you wanted nothing more

1960
01:47:14,834 --> 01:47:17,485
than to be part of the "Eye,"
but you were never invited.

1961
01:47:17,554 --> 01:47:20,717
So you try to destroy them.
But instead what happens?

1962
01:47:21,194 --> 01:47:22,684
You pissed them off.

1963
01:47:24,394 --> 01:47:27,443
The Eye isn't real.

1964
01:47:27,514 --> 01:47:30,597
Okay, then, explain then.
Who's behind all this?

1965
01:47:30,874 --> 01:47:32,205
Somebody with an obsession.

1966
01:47:32,434 --> 01:47:33,879
- Meticulous.
- Who?

1967
01:47:33,954 --> 01:47:37,276
Somebody prepared to sacrifice everything.

1968
01:47:37,354 --> 01:47:39,960
Somebody so prepared to lose

1969
01:47:40,034 --> 01:47:42,514
that they wouldn't even be a suspect
until the trick was done.

1970
01:47:42,634 --> 01:47:45,444
I don't want a profile.
I need a name. Who? Who?

1971
01:47:45,554 --> 01:47:47,204
I don't know who.

1972
01:47:47,594 --> 01:47:49,801
But they had to have
access to the warehouse

1973
01:47:49,874 --> 01:47:51,205
to plant the mirrors.

1974
01:47:52,554 --> 01:47:56,400
Always a step ahead of me. And the FBI.

1975
01:47:56,474 --> 01:47:59,717
Got past them not once,
not twice, but consistently.

1976
01:48:00,034 --> 01:48:02,685
Almost as if they were on the...

1977
01:48:15,554 --> 01:48:16,965
The inside.

1978
01:48:29,074 --> 01:48:30,121
You.

1979
01:48:34,754 --> 01:48:35,755
Why?

1980
01:48:36,594 --> 01:48:38,915
That is the question, isn't it?

1981
01:48:39,754 --> 01:48:41,324
You're right.

1982
01:48:41,914 --> 01:48:44,281
I can't tell you how long I've waited

1983
01:48:44,354 --> 01:48:46,322
to see the look on your face.

1984
01:48:48,754 --> 01:48:50,279
Who are you?

1985
01:48:51,354 --> 01:48:52,765
What do you want from me?

1986
01:48:53,594 --> 01:48:55,119
What do I want?

1987
01:48:55,514 --> 01:48:58,438
I want you to spend
the rest of your life in this cell,

1988
01:48:58,514 --> 01:49:02,519
staring at four walls
and wondering how you missed it.

1989
01:49:03,194 --> 01:49:06,277
How you let yourself
be so blinded by your ego

1990
01:49:06,874 --> 01:49:09,275
that you convinced yourself
that you were one step ahead

1991
01:49:09,354 --> 01:49:12,119
when you were always two steps behind.

1992
01:49:16,794 --> 01:49:18,000
Dylan?

1993
01:49:18,954 --> 01:49:19,955
Wait a minute.

1994
01:49:20,994 --> 01:49:23,156
Dylan! How did this happen?

1995
01:49:30,794 --> 01:49:32,478
Dylan!

1996
01:49:32,594 --> 01:49:33,595
Why?

1997
01:49:34,314 --> 01:49:35,315
Why?

1998
01:49:39,314 --> 01:49:41,476
Oh, my God.

1999
01:49:42,474 --> 01:49:44,363
I did not see that coming.

2000
01:49:44,474 --> 01:49:45,760
That's impossible!

2001
01:49:45,834 --> 01:49:46,835
No way.

2002
01:49:46,914 --> 01:49:49,315
That was actually pretty good.

2003
01:49:49,754 --> 01:49:50,835
Thank you.

2004
01:49:51,234 --> 01:49:53,475
When I said,
"Always be the smartest guy in the room."

2005
01:49:53,554 --> 01:49:54,601
We were in agreement.

2006
01:49:54,834 --> 01:49:55,995
Okay. Right.

2007
01:49:56,394 --> 01:49:57,395
Henley.

2008
01:49:58,154 --> 01:49:59,997
I've never seen her speechless.

2009
01:50:00,074 --> 01:50:01,678
I take that as a huge compliment.

2010
01:50:02,394 --> 01:50:05,045
Hey, man,
I'm so sorry for kicking your ass. Really.

2011
01:50:05,834 --> 01:50:07,359
Hey, listen, for the record,

2012
01:50:07,514 --> 01:50:11,041
I have always been a 100% believer.

2013
01:50:11,194 --> 01:50:13,435
And the amount of energy
I have expended to keep

2014
01:50:13,514 --> 01:50:15,642
these infidels on point...

2015
01:50:15,714 --> 01:50:17,762
Merritt, you're in.

2016
01:50:18,594 --> 01:50:19,675
God bless.

2017
01:50:19,794 --> 01:50:20,841
Come.

2018
01:50:21,874 --> 01:50:25,037
The real magic is taking
four strong solo acts

2019
01:50:25,234 --> 01:50:27,123
and making them all work together.

2020
01:50:27,354 --> 01:50:29,675
And that's exactly what you did.

2021
01:50:30,634 --> 01:50:31,715
So welcome.

2022
01:50:35,034 --> 01:50:37,082
Welcome to the Eye.

2023
01:51:44,274 --> 01:51:46,356
It was all connected.

2024
01:51:46,994 --> 01:51:49,998
Credit Republican. Tressler Insurance.

2025
01:51:59,354 --> 01:52:00,685
And Elkhorn?

2026
01:52:00,794 --> 01:52:02,717
What's the connection to Shrike?

2027
01:52:05,194 --> 01:52:08,437
Elkhorn started as a safe manufacturer.

2028
01:52:08,754 --> 01:52:10,882
They used cheap steel.

2029
01:52:12,474 --> 01:52:13,760
They cut corners.

2030
01:52:13,834 --> 01:52:17,077
When he got
to the bottom of the river, the safe warped.

2031
01:52:17,154 --> 01:52:18,519
And he was trapped.

2032
01:52:20,074 --> 01:52:21,644
He was your father.

2033
01:52:23,514 --> 01:52:26,882
<i>The morning before the show
didn't feel like any other day.</i>

2034
01:52:27,914 --> 01:52:32,920
<i>When my father said he had to go to work,
he could see that I didn't want him to leave.</i>

2035
01:52:35,154 --> 01:52:40,285
<i>So he gave me his watch, and he told me
to count the seconds until he came back.</i>

2036
01:52:41,474 --> 01:52:44,159
<i>I have never let his watch stop since then.</i>

2037
01:52:44,234 --> 01:52:46,396
And from that moment on,

2038
01:52:46,474 --> 01:52:49,000
I created a persona.

2039
01:52:49,634 --> 01:52:51,557
I planned. I worked out every detail.

2040
01:52:51,634 --> 01:52:54,922
But the one thing
that I couldn't imagine happening

2041
01:52:55,354 --> 01:52:56,515
was you.

2042
01:52:58,194 --> 01:53:01,164
And I know that
the logical conclusion for you

2043
01:53:01,634 --> 01:53:04,399
is to take this case to its resolution.

2044
01:53:04,474 --> 01:53:07,523
And for you to turn me in.

2045
01:53:12,674 --> 01:53:13,721
Yeah.

2046
01:53:15,674 --> 01:53:19,520
But you know how I feel
about resolution and logic.

2047
01:53:20,874 --> 01:53:22,205
And you also know

2048
01:53:23,074 --> 01:53:27,443
that I think some things
are best left unexplained.

2049
01:53:33,914 --> 01:53:35,723
One more secret to lock away.

2050
01:54:03,274 --> 01:54:04,799
<i>Come in close.</i>

2051
01:54:05,274 --> 01:54:06,560
<i>Closer.</i>

2052
01:54:06,634 --> 01:54:08,875
<i>Because now you know our secret.</i>

2053
01:54:08,954 --> 01:54:11,321
<i>We could be anywhere. Watching you.</i>

2054
01:54:11,914 --> 01:54:15,555
<i>We're looking for someone
to help us with our next trick.</i>

2055
01:54:15,634 --> 01:54:18,205
<i>On the count of three, open your eyes</i>

2056
01:54:18,274 --> 01:54:20,242
<i>and tell me what you see.</i>

2057
01:54:21,234 --> 01:54:22,315
One.

2058
01:54:22,434 --> 01:54:23,435
<i>Two...</i>

2059
01:55:55,274 --> 01:55:57,163
Please, stop, stop, stop.

2060
01:55:57,514 --> 01:56:01,235
All right, stop the van. Stop the van.
I'm gonna jump out of the van.

2061
01:56:02,234 --> 01:56:03,724
Oh, thank God.

2062
01:56:05,674 --> 01:56:07,756
Where are we?

2063
01:56:07,834 --> 01:56:10,235
Great, another shit hole.

2064
01:56:10,314 --> 01:56:12,237
Okay, feeling it.

2065
01:56:12,354 --> 01:56:16,518
I'm exhausted, and hungry, and cranky.

2066
01:56:17,554 --> 01:56:19,443
Check out this place.

2067
01:56:19,605 --> 01:56:22,382
- Where'd you bring us?
- Was there no landfill where we were?

2068
01:56:22,394 --> 01:56:24,283
This place is awesome.

2069
01:56:25,794 --> 01:56:26,795
Is this our new gear?

2070
01:56:26,874 --> 01:56:28,444
There'd better not be, like,
matching jumpsuits in there.

2071
01:56:28,514 --> 01:56:29,561
You know I don't wear spandex.

2072
01:56:29,634 --> 01:56:32,035
It's locked.
- Guys, the cards.

2073
01:56:32,114 --> 01:56:34,640
- What card?
- What do you mean, "what card"?

2074
01:56:38,949 --> 01:56:39,535
Okay.
