1
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,919
Kaylie!

2
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,631
Shh!

3
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,590
And I fired.

4
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,708
As many times as I've
had this dream...

5
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,245
it's never been me before.

6
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,346
Holding the gun.

7
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,311
I know.

8
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,745
That's very good.

9
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,199
It implies a true, deeply-rooted
acceptance of responsibility.

10
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,639
And it tells me that you haven't
only overcome your delusion

11
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,159
in your conscious mind...

12
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,679
but in his subconscious
mind as well.

13
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,439
It's my opinion that
Tim is a healthy adult

14
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,639
who represents no danger
to himself or anyone else.

15
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,399
And I believe he should be
discharged, as the state requested,

16
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,828
on his upcoming 21st birthday.

17
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,039
going once...

18
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,359
eleven-five twice...

19
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,919
Sold to the gentleman.

20
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,941
Congratulations to you, sir.
That's bidder number 131.

21
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,719
All right, and our
next item for bid

22
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,479
is a gorgeous antique mirror,
recovered from the Levesque Estate.

23
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,399
The Lasser Glass is a
well-traveled gem.

24
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,959
It spent several seasons adorning
the walls at Balmoral Castle,

25
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,199
Scottish home of the Royal Family.

26
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,599
This is the original glass
and the original frame.

27
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,079
The mirror is in remarkable condition,
save for a small hairline fracture

28
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,999
down in the lower
right-hand corner.

29
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,879
The frame is carved out of one
piece of Bavarian Black Cedar.

30
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,639
And we will go ahead
and start the bidding

31
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,919
at a conservative ten
thousand dollars.

32
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,159
Do I have ten? Right here
in front. Thank you, sir.

33
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,039
Your sister is picking
you up, then?

34
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,742
Her message even said something
about helping me find a job.

35
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,559
That'd be wonderful
for your transition.

36
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,399
We're at 12,000 dollars
on the phone...

37
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,599
You sure you don't want
me to come with you?

38
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,479
- Some moral support?
- No. But thank you.

39
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,039
I think I better do
this part myself.

40
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,839
- Wait up for us.
- Of course.

41
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,679
Remember what we talked about.

42
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,279
You've had a support system,
a mandated support system,

43
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,879
to help you get well. Kaylie
had to get by on her own.

44
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,599
It's very important that you
reconnect with your sister.

45
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,700
But it's more important that
you protect your recovery.

46
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,839
- Sixteen thousand.
- Sixteen thousand on Skype.

47
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,599
That is sixteen, going once.
Sixteen twice.

48
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,879
Sold. Please pass along
our congratulations.

49
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,864
- See you tonight.
- OK.

50
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,429
Son, just pull the
door when it buzzes.

51
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,909
Hey, little brother.

52
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,588
Your half of the estate.

53
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,679
Oh, apartments.

54
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,519
So all the studies say
that you should transition

55
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,319
to a place that isn't
necessarily large,

56
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,399
so I printed off some
listings for studios.

57
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,919
But in the meantime, until
you find one you like,

58
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,143
we would love it if
you stayed with us.

59
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,519
Kaylie, I don't know
how to thank you.

60
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,903
Well, I wanted to talk to you
about all of this sooner.

61
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,941
But suddenly they wouldn't
let me in to see you.

62
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,959
It wasn't...

63
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,548
It wasn't that they wouldn't
let you in to see me.

64
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,300
I just had some things I needed
to figure out for myself.

65
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,465
I get it.

66
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,559
I'm your family.

67
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,431
The only thing that matters
is that you're here now.

68
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,305
I found it.

69
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,999
- What do you mean?
- You know.

70
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,759
It wasn't easy.

71
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,399
I tracked it down mostly through second
bidders, people who lost at the auctions.

72
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,919
It was in storage, part of an
estate collection in Bremen.

73
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,599
It took me a year and a half
to get it into our warehouse

74
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,279
and it lasted less than a week.

75
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,199
It's about to ship out to a new
buyer, so we only have a few days,

76
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,150
but it should be enough.

77
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,942
A few days for what, Kaylie?

78
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,507
To keep our promise.

79
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,585
And kill it.

80
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,839
OK, guys, the couch can go there.

81
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,799
And those boxes are kitchen.

82
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,910
- Bam! Bam!
- Tim, we don't shoot the movers.

83
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,599
And as soon as I get my files
organized, you will have them.

84
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,199
Yes. Shoot.

85
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,786
Can I call you back?

86
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,439
Jeff, I am so sorry I
didn't return your call.

87
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,959
I've just been slammed. It's a lot
easier when you have a staff.

88
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,719
- Kaylie's under arrest.
- She's not here, buddy.

89
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,079
Sneak attack!

90
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,959
You are so dead!

91
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,559
Honey?

92
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,879
And this goes? OK,
against the wall.

93
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,639
Watch the molding.

94
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,759
Thank you. OK. OK. It's fragile.

95
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,599
- Hey, guys! Take it outside.
- But, Mom...

96
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,519
The alternative is moving boxes.

97
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,879
Oh, come on. Come on.

98
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,759
So we'll talk soon. OK.

99
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,919
Thanks, guys. OK.

100
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,439
I'll be right out.

101
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,479
So you expanded the
furniture order?

102
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,559
I don't know if I'm
loving this desk here.

103
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,228
Were you gonna tell me or just
wait till I saw the Visa bill?

104
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,701
Hold on.

105
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,679
I was hoping to smooth that over
with a three-piece vanity set

106
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,519
that is supposed to be here...
Is it not here?

107
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,399
I get it. OK. Do your
office however you want.

108
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,079
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

109
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,279
It's a bit ostentatious,
though, don't you think?

110
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,799
I'm confused, because you
wanted the antiques.

111
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,719
And I said I was fine with IKEA.

112
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,439
Yeah, I wanted to get a few
pieces to upgrade the place,

113
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,119
not turn it into a showroom.

114
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,399
Listen, we got a new
home, a new company,

115
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,704
so we get new furniture.
Makes sense.

116
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,599
Same old wife, though, right?

117
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,506
Well, I told you I
was fine with IKEA.

118
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,511
- Kidding.
- I'm not IKEA.

119
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,159
You sure you prefer this?

120
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,703
Our guest room is a
lot nicer than this.

121
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,506
Yeah. I think it might be best.

122
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,626
My own space.

123
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,910
You promised me you'd never
forget what really happened.

124
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,710
You promised.

125
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,999
I was ten years old.

126
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,631
Well...

127
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,799
I'm doing it tomorrow night.

128
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,502
And... I could really,
really use your help.

129
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,830
Good night, Tim.

130
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,461
I feel like my scar is more noticeable
now than it was ten years ago.

131
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,719
Let me take a look.
I'm a professional.

132
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,439
What scar?

133
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,639
We're nowhere near done.

134
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,919
So?

135
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,302
You've only put together the bed.

136
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,984
That wasn't easy.

137
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,110
Damn it.

138
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,984
Shit.

139
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,999
No! No! No!

140
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,599
No! No! No!

141
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,719
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

142
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,079
It's OK. It's OK.

143
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,759
It's just one of your night
terrors. It's OK. Shh...

144
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,064
Shh...

145
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,359
- Hey.
- Hey.

146
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,439
So I requisitioned you your own printer.
You don't have to share anymore.

147
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,679
- We'll take you off the network.
- OK.

148
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,999
Because I guess there were
some complaints about people

149
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,519
printing out their sales reports
and finding some really...

150
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,519
graphic crime scene
photos from, uh...

151
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,629
your computer.

152
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,799
I noticed you put in a transfer
order for the Lasser Glass.

153
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,319
- Yeah, as a repair.
- Oh.

154
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,239
I thought Warren said no repairs.

155
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,224
He changed his mind.

156
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,679
Got to be honest, I'm really
just waiting for an explanation

157
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,028
for the corpse print-outs.

158
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,439
I know things have
been strange at times.

159
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,519
And you know I'm dealing
with some dark stuff,

160
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,221
some parental stuff, with Tim out.

161
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,991
I'll never expect you to
understand that part of my life.

162
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,399
Just bear with me a
day or two more.

163
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,959
Things will get back to normal.

164
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,625
I promise.

165
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,199
I don't usually get transfer orders
to third-party repair houses.

166
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,559
Oh, yeah, the buyer wants his guy
to look at it before it ships.

167
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,039
- But we both know you'd do it better.
- No argument there.

168
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,469
I'll take it there myself. Babysit
it every step of the way.

169
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,306
Better get some furni pads
if we're going to move her.

170
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,264
Hello again.

171
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,624
You must be hungry.

172
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,547
I hope this still hurts.

173
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,545
You're all set.

174
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,871
You all right?

175
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,947
I'm great.

176
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,959
The guys will wrap her
up for you in a bit.

177
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,705
Thank you, Warren.

178
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,439
I'll see you at home.

179
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,584
My car is by the loading dock.

180
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,479
- Hello.
- Hey.

181
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,519
- Got a phone.
- Cool.

182
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,959
You just need to sign the order.

183
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,759
I don't feel good about the
way we left it last night.

184
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,559
Can we meet up somewhere and talk?

185
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,039
Of course. Can you
come by the house?

186
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,839
Sure. What's your address?

187
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,950
No. The house.

188
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,719
Yes, I have it in front of me.

189
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,999
I don't know, probably half
an hour. Does that work?

190
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,559
OK.

191
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,430
Speak then.

192
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,599
Oh, crap.

193
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,679
I'm gonna get you, you little brat!

194
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,319
The answer is still no.

195
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,679
Oh, my God, Ally has one
and Maddie has one.

196
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,999
I'm the only kid in my
class without a phone.

197
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,839
That is terrible.

198
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,959
Thanks for nothing, Marie.

199
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,039
Oh!

200
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,519
I'm going to run out and get one
for you right now, daughter,

201
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,479
love of my life, fruit of my loins.

202
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,703
Well, I wish I'd been a pineapple.

203
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,879
Hey kids, do me a favor and don't ever
chew your nails like your father.

204
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,239
- It's gross.
- Hey, Dad?

205
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,159
OK... He's Dad. I'm Marie.

206
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,479
Who was that lady in
your office today?

207
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,910
Yeah, Dad, who was that
lady in your office today?

208
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,791
What lady?

209
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,387
I don't know. Just some lady.

210
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,666
I don't know.

211
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,479
It looks so small.

212
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,119
- Go on, Dog.
- You named your dog, Dog?

213
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,310
No. He doesn't have a name.

214
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,740
Are you OK?

215
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,704
Oh, of course.

216
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,950
You haven't been here since...

217
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,471
Why don't you look around?

218
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,799
The house just sat on the market
while I was in the foster system.

219
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,079
Released to me when I turned 18.

220
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,509
I was the only homeowner in the
freshman dorms when I started school.

221
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,319
I'm thinking we should
try and sell it, though.

222
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,224
You know, after.

223
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,191
So will you help me with
something before you go?

224
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,679
How the hell did you expect to
get this thing in here yourself?

225
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,319
To be honest, I didn't.

226
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,479
I always thought
it'd be both of us.

227
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,759
Over here for now.

228
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,186
OK.

229
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,599
What's that?

230
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,868
Yacht anchor. Kill switch.

231
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,959
So, uh...

232
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,719
I understand if you
don't want to stay.

233
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,388
I accept that, but I
got to get started.

234
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,782
I'll stay for a little bit.

235
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,425
Excuse me.

236
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,039
Hello. My name is
Kaylie Ann Russell.

237
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,359
I'm 23 years old.

238
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,799
I'm with my brother,
Timothy Alan Russell.

239
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,639
Alan, of course, after his father.

240
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,305
He's...

241
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,679
He's 21 years old.

242
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,399
It's 4:15pm on October 13th,

243
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,079
and we are at 2705 Hawthorne Way.

244
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,559
I'll begin by detailing my precautions
before I place and uncover the glass.

245
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,279
There are three cameras, each on
its own independent power circuit,

246
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,079
so if any anomalies occur, there
can be a lucid, objective record.

247
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,119
I have private land lines for today's
experiment, along with my cell phone.

248
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,759
And I will now ask my
brother for his phone,

249
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,143
so that I can control
all electronic devices.

250
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,671
I just got this, you know.

251
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,191
Thanks, Timbo.

252
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,559
This alarm is set to go
off every 45 minutes

253
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,799
to remind me to change the
tapes in the cameras.

254
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,479
This alarm is set to go off
hourly to remind us to eat.

255
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,479
And we're fully stocked on
water to prevent dehydration.

256
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,159
Now, as for the house itself...

257
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,719
each room is fitted with
its own thermostat,

258
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,319
from which data is collected by
software designed to track and record

259
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,959
temperature fluctuations
in hospitals.

260
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,759
Any temperature changes greater than
five degrees in either direction

261
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,839
will set off an alarm.

262
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,639
A third precaution
is also in place,

263
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,919
but I'll get into that
in a few more minutes.

264
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,199
So...

265
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,199
The purpose of today's experiment

266
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,639
is to prove that the object
behind me, the Lasser Glass,

267
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,999
is home to an observable,
predictable supernatural force.

268
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,559
There's no scientific equivalent
for the word "haunted,"

269
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,399
so we'll just say this object is
responsible for at least 45 deaths

270
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,719
in the four centuries of
its recorded existence...

271
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,959
Can I just stop you for a second?

272
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,183
Don't ever turn off a camera.

273
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,266
Sorry.

274
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,319
The origin of the Lasser
Glass is unknown,

275
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,439
so I can't provide a
complete history,

276
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,439
but the trail starts
in London in 1754.

277
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,719
Philip Lasser, the 17th
Earl of Leicester,

278
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,359
acquired the mirror and hung
it over his fireplace, and...

279
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,159
Another precaution.

280
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,319
Hi, sweetie. How are you?

281
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,079
Well, I'm checking in,
uh, as requested.

282
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,199
- You all right?
- Everything's fine.

283
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,919
I know this is silly to ask, but
could you try to call on the hour?

284
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,959
It's about seven past.

285
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,959
- Uh... Sure.
- I'll talk to you in 53 minutes.

286
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,759
And I love you.

287
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,279
I'm expecting regular calls
from my fiance, Michael Dumont.

288
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,399
I told him I'm nervous to be
spending time with my recently

289
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,199
un-incarcerated brother,
with instructions...

290
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,519
- to notify the authorities immediately
- Wow.

291
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,999
if I do not answer the phone.

292
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,839
- In the room.
- Nothing personal.

293
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,759
So, in 1755, Philip Lasser was
found in their grand fireplace.

294
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,719
Burned beyond recognition.
While his estate was dismantled

295
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,439
and scattered throughout
southern England,

296
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,999
one of the family's stewards claimed
to see Philip reflected in the mirror.

297
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,279
An allegation apparently taken
seriously enough to warrant

298
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,319
a Church investigation
into the house.

299
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,439
The glass, thereafter known
as the Lasser Glass,

300
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,119
is sold in public auction in 1758.

301
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,239
The next known owner is an
American rail road tycoon,

302
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,759
named Robert Clancy, 1864.

303
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,239
Clancy apparently weighed
over 300 pounds.

304
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,519
In fact, while attending
university in Connecticut,

305
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,239
he was known as the
South Windham Whale.

306
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,079
He hung the glass in his
ballroom in Atlanta.

307
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,599
Later that year, Robert
Clancy is photographed

308
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,759
by a local newspaper and, uh...

309
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,199
Well, he's dropped a few pounds.

310
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,439
His obit was printed a few weeks later.
Doesn't list a cause of death.

311
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,199
Unfortunately, he and his
estate and the glass

312
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,919
are presumably destroyed in Sherman's
march to the ocean in 1865.

313
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,719
And after that, the glass is lost.

314
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,399
Until it resurfaces in
turn-of-the-century New England.

315
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,079
The next case of note
is Mary O'Connor, 1904.

316
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,799
She hung the mirror in
her private bathroom.

317
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,279
Two weeks later, her niece Beatrice
finds Mary dead in the bathtub.

318
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,119
Now, the official coroner's report lists
the cause of death as, get this...

319
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,319
dehydration.

320
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,839
The woman died of thirst while soaking
in a full tub for three days.

321
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,399
The next case of note is Alice Carden
in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, 1943.

322
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,519
Neighbors reported hearing screams
and loud bangs from the house.

323
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,559
The police found the children
drowned in a locked cistern.

324
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,159
Alice herself was in the nursery,

325
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,879
and both of her legs are
completely shattered.

326
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,359
Her left arm is broken in four places,
and six of her ribs are crushed.

327
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,039
In her right hand is a large hammer she's
been using to break her own bones.

328
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,759
They find her just as she's
going to work on her skull.

329
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,999
Her right arm, though,
is completely unharmed.

330
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,959
Because she needed it.
To wield the hammer.

331
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,679
Alice later says she believed she was
tucking the children into their beds

332
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,119
as she sealed them
into the cistern.

333
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,479
She never recovers
from her injuries.

334
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,559
And, oh, the family kept
several dogs at the farm,

335
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,639
including an Australian
shepherd for the children.

336
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,431
Let's eat.

337
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,310
Who exactly are you talking to?
On those tapes?

338
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,119
All the people who stared, pointed.

339
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,999
The kids at school who
always found out.

340
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,588
I guess I'm talking to everyone
who ever called Dad a murderer.

341
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,309
Called you a murderer.

342
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,519
Look, Kaylie, we were just kids.

343
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,319
We made up a scary story so we
wouldn't have to accept the fact

344
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,639
that our father was
a murderer. He was.

345
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,102
He was a sick man who
tortured and killed our...

346
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,151
You can call me crazy all you like.

347
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,146
But you're not allowed to
talk about him that way.

348
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,479
Tobin Capp, 1955. Starved to
death in his own bedroom.

349
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,559
The mirror was hung over his dresser.
He had a pet Dalmatian.

350
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,439
1965, California.

351
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,439
The mirror hangs in the lobby of
the Hill Trust Bank in San Diego.

352
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,599
A ten-year teller, Marcia Wicker,
locks her manager in the bank vault

353
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,319
and then chews through
a live power line.

354
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,999
- 1975, Marisol Chavez...
- Kaylie...

355
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,919
dies in her bedroom of
hemorrhaging due to a miscarriage.

356
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,959
In her nightstand, they find
every single one of her teeth

357
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,359
in a little plastic bag and
a pair of bloody pliers.

358
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,119
- 2002...
- There's a huge difference

359
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,759
between causation and correlation.

360
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,119
I know the difference, thank you.

361
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,039
OK then. In 2001, Mom and
Dad bought that new couch.

362
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,359
Same year, Grandpa had a heart attack,
Robbie Schultz got hit by a car.

363
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,319
And our cat ran away.

364
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,799
How much of that do you
blame on that couch?

365
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,719
Can I get back to this now?

366
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,079
Sure, but let's get to it, Kaylie.

367
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,667
Let's talk about why
we're really here.

368
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,226
Let's.

369
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,319
2002.

370
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,829
The Lasser Glass adorns the
home office of Alan Russell.

371
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,903
Software designer.
Husband to Marie.

372
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,479
Father to Timothy and Kaylie.

373
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,959
Within two weeks of its arrival,

374
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,999
Marie suffers an intense
psychological breakdown

375
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,079
and is tortured and murdered
in the family home.

376
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,870
By whom?

377
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,589
By her husband.

378
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,159
So say the police reports.

379
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,067
And her husband was shot
to death by her own son.

380
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,542
Right in front of her daughter.

381
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,119
I intend to prove that none of
the people I've just described

382
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,479
were responsible for their actions.

383
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,599
Alan Russell was not a
murderer. He was a victim.

384
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,119
One of many, as it turns out.

385
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,759
Victims of the supernatural force
that resides in that mirror.

386
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,507
So why don't we just end it right
now and smash the goddamn thing?

387
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,348
You really don't remember, do you?

388
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,462
Remember what?

389
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,543
Please, smash it, by all means.

390
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,381
Okay.

391
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,759
You know, I've learned a lot about what
happens to people when they can't...

392
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,301
can't process something horrible.

393
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,707
The mind creates all kinds of
protections to help them cope.

394
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,919
And once that belief's taken root,

395
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,225
the mind takes random information and
forces it to support that narrative.

396
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,879
How many thousands of records
did you have to pore through

397
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,399
to find 12 or 13 that
support your case?

398
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,146
Why did you put the stool down?

399
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,239
Because I'm trying to have
a conversation with you.

400
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,439
Uh-huh. Only one person I
know of was ever documented

401
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,039
trying to break the mirror.
Oliver Jeffries. 1971.

402
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,959
A teacher at Manhattan's
Duhame Academy,

403
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,519
where the mirror hung in
the central lecture hall.

404
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,159
One morning he reportedly ran at
the mirror with a fireplace poker,

405
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,839
shouting about how it
needed to be destroyed,

406
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,279
but he never struck a blow.
According to the students,

407
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,839
he stood there quietly
for almost a minute

408
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,984
before walking out of the
hall and into traffic.

409
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,559
It's clearly capable of
defending itself, and...

410
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,147
I think it just disarmed you.

411
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,759
You know why I didn't
smash the mirror, Kaylie?

412
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,588
Besides you getting fired or charged
with destruction of property?

413
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,423
It isn't mine to break.

414
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,759
No one can break your
delusion for you.

415
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,839
You have to do it yourself.

416
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,461
Which leads me to my
final precaution.

417
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,999
You're looking at a
20-pound Danforth anchor.

418
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,279
Another 20 pounds added with barbells,
attached to a modified ballast rail

419
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,879
and a spring pin lock connected
to a mechanical kitchen timer.

420
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,239
No electricity, which is important,
and we're about ten seconds away.

421
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,559
If the timer is not manually
reset every 30 minutes,

422
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,159
that is, if no one is
here to stop it...

423
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,519
The mirror goes right there. And
the only thing to prevent that

424
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,799
from happening again is
our continued survival.

425
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,319
You know why we don't have to
wait for it to come out and play?

426
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,279
Because we've got a
loaded gun to its head.

427
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,390
And I expect it'll be
eager to defend itself.

428
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,306
Aah!

429
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,679
It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt.

430
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,984
It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt.

431
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,790
Hey guys?

432
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,741
Come into my office for a second.

433
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,039
I thought I was pretty clear about
you guys not messing around in here.

434
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,626
We don't.

435
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,224
I don't like it in here.

436
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,700
All right, well, what is this?

437
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,145
We didn't do that.

438
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,759
OK.

439
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,599
You know, I can hear you guys at
night, messing around in here.

440
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,079
I was a kid once, too. I get it.
I know the move has been difficult.

441
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,279
This isn't gonna happen anymore.

442
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,599
OK?

443
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,319
And if you're messing around
with your mother's plants,

444
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,384
you're gonna cut that out, too.

445
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,279
You know what dead plants
are evidence of to me?

446
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,424
Problems with the water
supply and maybe a bad tank.

447
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,799
I seem to remember drinking
out of a Brita filter.

448
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,999
Oliver Jeffries, dead
plants in the classroom.

449
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,039
Tobin Capp, dead
plants in the bedroom.

450
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,639
Garden service at Hill Trust
Bank couldn't understand

451
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,799
why they had dead plants
all over the place.

452
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,439
Live plant.

453
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,039
Live plants in the living room.

454
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,559
Live plants, plants that have life.

455
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,199
- These are your rules, by the way.
- Give it time.

456
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,199
It always starts with
the low-hanging fruit.

457
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,399
It wasn't just the plants
it fed on, though.

458
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,519
There was another variable, too.

459
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,221
Dog!

460
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,279
Sorry, Dog.

461
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,785
Hydrate.

462
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,639
- Come on, boy.
- Come on, Mason. Go fetch.

463
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,999
- Come on. Mason.
- Go fetch.

464
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,679
Chase the stick. Chase the stick.

465
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,584
Come on. Go. Go.

466
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,319
I mean, the whole
reason I got this thing

467
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,679
was because you were freaked
out that we weren't safe.

468
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,319
Said you saw somebody down here.

469
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,599
Yeah, but that doesn't
make me feel safer.

470
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,679
Quite the opposite, actually.

471
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,359
OK, I will lock it up, unloaded,

472
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:54,551
where I'm sure it'll come in very
handy in the case of an emergency.

473
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,068
Grotesque cow.

474
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,622
What did you just say to me?

475
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,704
I didn't say anything.

476
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,229
Ow! Jesus!

477
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,479
Alan!

478
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,908
I'm working!

479
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,909
Who are you talking to?

480
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,182
Were you gonna do something
about the damn barking?

481
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,079
There's something wrong with
the dog, Alan. He bit me.

482
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,508
Are you OK?

483
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,344
I'm fine.

484
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,759
You know, you are just lost
in your own world in here.

485
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,479
I'm not lost in my own
world! I'm working!

486
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,959
I know that.

487
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,199
I've supported that.
This isn't you working hard.

488
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,519
When you start your own
business, it's all on you.

489
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,266
- I know that, Alan!
- I have to do this!

490
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,879
Guys. Listen, you got to do
me a special favor today.

491
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,879
I have a golf session
with a client.

492
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,479
And I'm gonna need you to
stay out of my office. OK?

493
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,464
OK, Dad.

494
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,909
All right. I love you guys.

495
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,039
Fine. You wanna go
in, you're going in.

496
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,661
Go shit on the CEO's carpet.

497
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,461
Shit.

498
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,759
Why can't we let him out?

499
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,479
Mom says Mason's grounded.

500
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,319
Hey, squirts. Why are you, uh...?

501
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,359
We have got to do something
about that damn dog.

502
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,759
A hello would be nice.

503
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,959
He was a wrecking ball all day.
I had to lock him in your office.

504
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,581
Well, tether him up.

505
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,300
Where is he?

506
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,679
Well, there's the problem.
You're remembering it wrong.

507
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,839
I promise. I'm not
remembering it wrong.

508
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,039
- You are, though. Mason...
- Alice Carden's Australian shepherd,

509
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,119
Tobin Capp's Dalmatian, the pets
were never found. None of them.

510
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,239
Do you remember Mason
toward the end?

511
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,599
Vomiting, accidents
all over the house.

512
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,879
My therapist had me
research Parvo virus.

513
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,679
- Oh, my God.
- It's a fatal canine illness,

514
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,599
flagged by nausea, aggression,
infected urine and stool,

515
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,239
which, incidentally,
can kill plants.

516
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,519
Mason was sick.

517
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,199
All right, I'll take him
to the vet tomorrow.

518
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,799
Bad news. I don't think
we're both coming home.

519
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,750
Mom, where's Mason?

520
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,359
Uh, he's grounded.

521
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,599
Are you saying you remember
it happening that way?

522
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,999
- Are you really saying that?
- Why not?

523
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,399
You're wrong. I saw Mom
lock him in the office

524
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,239
and I sat outside that door all
day, and nobody went in or out.

525
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,759
Have you ever heard of the fuzzy
trace theory of human psychology?

526
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,319
No. But I'm gonna guess you have.

527
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,599
I'm the star of a psychiatric
article about it.

528
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,319
Our brains actually encode
information as fuzzy traces.

529
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,719
More like a general meaning
than an exact record.

530
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,639
- This is horseshit, Tim.
- Adults are more likely

531
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,719
to combine those traces
into false memories.

532
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,319
You saw Mom put the dog in the
office on a number of occasions.

533
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,919
My God, what did they do to you?

534
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,399
Way before Dad forbade anyone
else from going in the office.

535
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,599
Those traces fused with
your memory of that day.

536
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,439
- I feel sorry for you.
- OK, what's more likely?

537
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,679
That you're misremembering
events from 11 years ago,

538
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,028
or that the mirror eats dogs?

539
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,188
Oh, look! It's Dog!

540
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,799
Give it some time.

541
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,106
A little time.

542
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:14,439
There's nothing going on here,
woman! You're really losing it!

543
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,639
I can hear you talking to someone,
and it sounds like a woman.

544
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,559
- You know what, you're crazy!
- I'm not crazy!

545
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,439
I can hear you talking to someone.

546
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,439
I mean, listen to yourself!
"I can hear you through the door."

547
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,719
Why would I make this up?
I'm not crazy!

548
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,199
The water supply is poisoned?
And we got a burglar?

549
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,309
You're losing your mind.

550
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,079
I'm sorry that we woke you up.

551
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:51,783
Are you and Daddy fighting because
of the woman in the office?

552
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,639
You got to remember that woman.
You saw her too.

553
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,519
I convinced myself I
saw a lot of things.

554
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,599
But what did we really see?

555
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,639
Mom yelling at Dad in the
middle of the night.

556
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,361
Mom said she heard voices, but it
was probably just Dad on the phone.

557
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,839
Doesn't explain the woman
I saw through the window.

558
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,919
But when did you see her?

559
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,159
The first time? We were
playing in the yard.

560
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,700
Was Mom at home?

561
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,391
Mom was always home.

562
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,907
Are you sure about that?
Because I'm not.

563
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,679
- Oh, shit.
- Shit.

564
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,186
Get back. Get back.

565
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,159
He was having an affair,
saint that he was.

566
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,959
It was a bad marriage.
Look how it ended up.

567
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,239
- No.
- Our father was a cheater,

568
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,839
- and it drove our mother crazy.
- Stop it.

569
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,799
He snapped and he killed her.
He was gonna do the same to us.

570
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,839
Oh, yeah. A bad marriage.

571
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,279
That explains how Mom had no
teeth, no hair, no mind left,

572
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,279
by the time she died.
Yeah, a bad marriage.

573
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,159
That explains those other people we
both saw in the house that last night.

574
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,679
He was withdrawn, secretive.
All signs of an affair.

575
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,839
I had access to all of
Mom and Dad's stuff.

576
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,719
While you were getting
brainwashed, I looked.

577
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,959
Not one credit card receipt,
phone call, flower order.

578
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,279
Nothing to suggest an affair.

579
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,079
He was smart enough
not to leave a trail.

580
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,399
Quiet!

581
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,159
I talked to his friends
and co-workers.

582
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,559
If there was another
woman, she was a ghost.

583
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,079
Yeah, I agree, he was withdrawn,
secretive, suspicious, sure.

584
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,559
All signs of an affair, fine. I'm
not saying he wasn't seduced.

585
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,022
It's a matter of what seduced him.

586
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,839
And things have been happening in
here while we argue, you know.

587
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,239
You know the temperature in here
has risen by three degrees?

588
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,959
- Three degrees.
- Two people in a small space,

589
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,639
lights burning,
electrical equipment...

590
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,759
Phone lines are probably down
by now. Why don't you check?

591
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,222
OK, then. Let's have a look.

592
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,147
Dial tone.

593
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,079
Static?

594
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,999
Look, Kaylie. You can
deal with this. I did it.

595
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,079
You want to redeem the family name?
You don't need to do it for Mom and Dad.

596
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,519
You only need to do
it for yourself.

597
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,679
Oh...

598
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,399
They did a bang-up job on
you in there, didn't they?

599
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,879
You were perfectly normal
when they locked you up.

600
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,879
You had to go bat-shit to get out.

601
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,319
Mason, stop your goddamn whining!

602
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,759
You know what? That's it. I'm done.

603
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,119
I know I'm supposed to
wait around for you

604
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,519
to find your own way out of this.

605
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,199
But I'm not gonna stand here
and let you torture a dog.

606
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,759
- What do you think you're doing?
- Listen to it!

607
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,631
Stop it! Stop it.

608
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,391
No! No! Wait!

609
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,639
What?

610
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,279
- You didn't need to do that.
- Oh, yes, I did, Kaylie. You're sick.

611
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,399
Nothing you said would
happen tonight has happened.

612
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,719
The plants are still alive,
the mirror is just a mirror.

613
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,943
The only thing threatening
that dog was you!

614
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,029
And it's not your fault.

615
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,159
Like it wasn't my fault.

616
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,359
I had help, and you were alone.

617
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,959
These kinds of problems
are hard to overcome,

618
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,024
but they're nothing
to be ashamed of.

619
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,710
They run in our family.

620
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,469
Kaylie, I'm sorry.

621
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,106
Look...

622
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,239
Let's get out of here.

623
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,465
Go some place else and
talk about how to move on.

624
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,625
Where can we go?

625
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,590
Oh, Kaylie...

626
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,159
Where?

627
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:53,519
Let's go turn off those
cameras, disarm that anchor...

628
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,629
and we can go anywhere you want.

629
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,759
Go talk to your fiancé, maybe.

630
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,108
He'll want to help.
You know he will.

631
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,599
Kaylie?

632
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,230
There it is.

633
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,344
There it is.

634
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,870
Ha!

635
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,586
Yes.

636
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,421
Yes!

637
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,026
Yes!

638
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,399
Yes. Yes.

639
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,907
Yes. Yes!

640
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,039
I'm now reviewing the tape
of the last few minutes.

641
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,319
He was having an affair,
saint that he was.

642
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,879
It was a bad marriage.
Look how it ended up.

643
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,359
Our father was a cheater,
and it drove our mother crazy.

644
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,999
- Stop it.
- He snapped and he killed her.

645
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,919
- He was gonna do the same to us.
- Yeah, a bad marriage.

646
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,199
That explains how Mom had no
teeth, no hair, no mind left,

647
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,439
by the time she died.
Yeah, a bad marriage.

648
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,159
That explains those other people we
both saw in the house that last night.

649
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,759
I don't remember doing that.

650
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,639
Do you? You don't.

651
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,839
The temperature in the room has
increased another two degrees

652
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,279
to 78 degrees Fahrenheit...

653
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,439
- but the alarms didn't go off...
- My phone.

654
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,919
We've lost the ficus and
the blooming plants.

655
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,559
- My phone.
- Which tells me that the dog

656
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,559
provided at least enough
energy to bait the shark.

657
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,959
I'd better call the doctor.

658
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,919
Tim. If you're gonna
make a phone call,

659
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,959
you need to do it outside
its radius of influence.

660
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,759
Otherwise there's no way of knowing
who you're really talking to.

661
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,959
Hello? Hi. Yeah.

662
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,439
Everything's fine now.

663
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,505
I'm sorry about earlier.
I'll talk to you in an hour.

664
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,399
50/50 that was even him.

665
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,668
We need to get out of
this room for a while.

666
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,580
It must've gotten more from
the dog than I guessed.

667
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,319
Its radius of influence
appears to be... 30 feet...

668
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,959
which means we're still
good to go in the kitchen,

669
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,119
laundry room, garage,
master bedroom,

670
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:57,639
and the yard, front and back.
Oh, but I doubt for very long.

671
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,783
Tim?

672
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,946
Tim!

673
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,999
Your call cannot be
completed as dialed.

674
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,759
Your call cannot be
completed as dialed.

675
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,559
Please check the
number and dial again.

676
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,639
Your call cannot be
completed as dialed.

677
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,279
Please check the
number and dial again.

678
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,867
Tim.

679
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,144
Tim.

680
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,119
How did I get back in here?

681
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,919
What do you mean? You walked
over here and you sat down.

682
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,479
- I was outside.
- No, you weren't.

683
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,999
Did you think you were?

684
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,119
Would you mind saying
that on camera?

685
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,439
Hey. Hey!

686
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,505
It's because you're still here
that I know we're gonna win.

687
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,184
Do you hear me?

688
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,784
Do you understand?

689
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,519
When's Daddy coming home?

690
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,359
I don't know.

691
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,519
You don't know when
Daddy's coming home?

692
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,868
I don't know where he is.

693
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,626
I know where he says he is.

694
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,630
Kaylie.

695
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,746
Tell me more about the
woman in the office.

696
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,464
I haven't seen her.

697
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,990
I have.

698
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,345
When?

699
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,111
Last night.

700
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,987
She wasn't in the office.

701
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,668
She was on the stairs.

702
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,359
What was she doing?

703
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,185
I didn't look.

704
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,824
I was scared.

705
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,510
But I think she went
back in the office.

706
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,790
I think she lives there.

707
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,706
You two go upstairs and play.

708
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,620
Mom?

709
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,839
Mom!

710
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,279
Tim!

711
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,799
Mom!

712
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,024
Go! Go, Tim!

713
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,589
Mommy, stop!

714
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:50,079
Please stop, Mommy!

715
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,541
Marie?

716
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,343
Hey! Hey!

717
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,824
Baby?

718
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,788
Sweetheart, you're bleeding.

719
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,790
Baby?

720
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,704
Hey, hey, hey!

721
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:07,679
Sweetheart, you gotta
go back in your room.

722
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,719
But, Mommy...

723
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,399
Your mother's fine.

724
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,079
She's going to be all right.
Just, please, go back inside.

725
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,303
Shut the door, OK, baby?

726
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,911
Fuck.

727
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,105
Fuck.

728
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,101
Yeah, I have an
emergency with my wife.

729
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,671
Everything is fine.

730
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,679
- Is Mommy OK?
- Go to bed.

731
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,151
Tim?

732
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,864
Tim.

733
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,959
Snap out of it!

734
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,639
Are you here?

735
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,146
Are you here with me?

736
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,711
Tim?

737
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:14,159
Guys, your mother
is very, very sick.

738
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:18,399
And, uh, she's gonna need to stay
in bed for a while, to rest up.

739
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,359
So she can get better.

740
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:23,266
But we don't want you
two bothering her.

741
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,666
We?

742
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:32,187
So, Champ, Princess...

743
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,279
we're gonna have to stay
clear of that room.

744
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,150
Is that understood?

745
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,782
What does she have?

746
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,999
Now...

747
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,719
you are welcome to...

748
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:56,150
hang out in here and
play video games.

749
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:00,385
I thought you said we
weren't allowed in here.

750
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,790
Eat.

751
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,987
Come on, I need your help.

752
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,661
Tim!

753
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,824
Tim, snap out of it!

754
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,879
Tim!

755
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,503
Is that for Mom?

756
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,910
Tim?

757
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,350
Nice.

758
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,308
Kaylie?

759
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,587
Maybe we should stay together.

760
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:16,302
She still loves me!

761
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,789
I'm hungry, Kaylie.

762
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,559
You need to go grocery
shopping, Dad.

763
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,679
What's that, Princess?

764
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:02,711
- Food.
- That's on my list.

765
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,879
The TV is out.

766
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,319
What's that, Princess?

767
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:11,159
We need to call a doctor for Mom.

768
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,064
That's on my list.

769
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,959
This is stupid.

770
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,239
I'm gonna tell her
we're out of food.

771
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,861
- But Dad said...
- I don't care what Dad said.

772
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,750
Mom?

773
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,159
She needs a doctor!

774
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,559
You told me she was
sick, but she's not...

775
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,239
You know what your problem is?
You don't listen!

776
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,799
I told you not to go
into our room, didn't I?

777
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,479
What do you do? You disobey me.

778
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,199
Why?

779
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:04,759
You disobeyed me, so
now you get grounded.

780
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,399
You and your snot-nosed
little brother over there

781
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,759
are not to step foot
outside of this house.

782
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,983
Now, get out of here.

783
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,189
OK. Thank you.

784
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,185
Bye.

785
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,425
What did the doctor say?

786
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:32,101
He said to have our father call.

787
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,708
Like the last one.

788
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:42,426
Exactly like the last one.

789
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,464
Same voice.

790
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,159
Hi, Bob.

791
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,359
I'm really sorry to hear that.

792
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,119
I hope she gets better soon.

793
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,319
Thanks for that, Bob.

794
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:20,759
You know what? I'm just sorry she
brought you all the way over here.

795
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:26,159
I mean, she's... you know, using
her mother's illness to act out.

796
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:29,759
Wait till she starts driving.
This is nothing.

797
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,279
Well, so sorry to bother you.

798
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,679
I hope Marie is up and about soon.

799
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,839
Thank you.

800
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,879
Hey, you know what?
Give me a ring next week

801
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,759
and we'll play the front
nine at Arrowhead.

802
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,799
Great. We'll do it.

803
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,864
- See ya.
- Take care.

804
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,279
Timbo.

805
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:18,426
We're gonna have to get
really, really brave.

806
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,343
Very clever.

807
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,664
Tim!

808
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,546
Kaylie?

809
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:59,159
And we've lost electric.

810
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:00,985
Predictable.

811
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,190
A dead plant.

812
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,430
It isn't real.

813
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:01,599
Daddy?

814
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,543
Could you fix the lights?

815
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,182
Nice tricks.

816
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:03,705
Kaylie...

817
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:20,860
Oh, my God.

818
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,265
Do you see him?

819
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,079
Hello?

820
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,826
Just checking in, seeing
how everything's going.

821
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,759
I'm fine.

822
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:09,429
OK, I guess I'll talk to you
in an hour. Enjoyed the chat.

823
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,829
That's a trick.

824
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,679
I didn't kill him. I couldn't have.
The plate, it wasn't real.

825
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:24,462
I didn't kill him because
the plate wasn't real!

826
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,639
Michael.

827
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:06,466
What did I do? What did I do?

828
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,559
Come on. We're getting out of here.

829
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,907
Come on, let's go.

830
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,519
Hello?

831
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:30,630
I need police and an ambulance.
2705 Hawthorne.

832
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,679
OK, OK.

833
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:36,439
Help is coming. They'll be here.
We'll straighten all this out.

834
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:40,745
Kaylie, we're OK. We're OK.

835
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,839
Michael, Michael, Michael.

836
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,559
When was the last time you
reset the kitchen timer?

837
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:47,559
- I don't know.
- Your plan was solid.

838
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,199
We don't have to do anything.

839
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,839
All we have to do is
just sit here and wait.

840
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:53,519
No more than half an hour.
Your kill switch.

841
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:56,079
- You called for help?
- Yeah.

842
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,064
We're done. It's over.

843
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,559
We get to stand here and
watch that thing die.

844
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,239
It's a trick to get us back inside.

845
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:30,305
What if this is a trick to
keep us standing there?

846
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,861
- I called for help.
- Call again.

847
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:46,719
911. What's your emergency?

848
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,439
Yeah, hi, I just called.
2705 Hawthorne.

849
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:50,359
You're going to have to
have your father call.

850
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:56,719
The doctor will be there tomorrow.

851
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,704
Timbo...

852
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,344
No!

853
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,429
What do we do?

854
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,559
We could do nothing. Just wait.

855
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,319
And watch ourselves get...

856
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:17,942
We're gonna have to get
really, really brave.

857
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,984
He looked at the mirror
and took out a gun.

858
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,223
We're gonna have to smash it.

859
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,359
That's not real.

860
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,947
I thought I told you not
to play around in here.

861
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:43,510
It's not real.

862
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,546
Shh!

863
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,824
Kaylie?

864
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,151
Is he gone?

865
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:55,950
He was never here.

866
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:00,319
It just herded us upstairs.

867
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:04,359
We made the right call outside.
It's really trying to keep us away.

868
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:06,199
It'll try harder. We
have to get downstairs

869
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:09,279
- before that anchor swings.
- You have to make sure he's gone first.

870
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:12,584
He's gone. I promise. See, he's...

871
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,703
We've got to get downstairs.

872
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,959
She's not gone.

873
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,879
- I'm gonna open the door.
- No!

874
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:04,519
I'm gonna open the door.
If she's not gone...

875
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,822
I want you to run right
down the stairs.

876
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:11,707
- What are you gonna do?
- Don't worry about that. Just run.

877
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,270
You ready?

878
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:24,702
I'm gonna open the door. You
run right down the stairs.

879
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,988
You trust me, right?

880
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,824
I trust you.

881
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:40,719
One... I love you.

882
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:43,944
Two... Straight for the stairs.

883
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,301
Three.

884
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,509
It's not real.

885
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,424
Just a trick.

886
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:22,630
You're gonna arrest me, Timbo?

887
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:31,830
Timbo?

888
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,505
Tim!

889
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,466
Tim?

890
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:46,267
Mommy, please, no.

891
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:27,180
Kaylie?

892
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:30,949
Kaylie?

893
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:34,900
Mommy!

894
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:38,025
Come on, Tim!

895
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:14,439
It won't let us.

896
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:17,346
I thought I told you not
to play around in here.

897
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:28,986
No.

898
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:32,104
This isn't you.

899
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,759
It is me.

900
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,799
I've met my demons,
and they are many.

901
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,559
I've seen...

902
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,799
I've seen the devil...

903
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,239
And he is...

904
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:45,951
and he is me.

905
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:54,624
Dad!

906
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:02,510
Let her go!

907
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:45,184
Run.

908
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:50,703
No! No!

909
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:52,799
Daddy!

910
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:56,706
Come on.

911
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:16,879
This isn't real! This isn't real!

912
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,864
This isn't real!

913
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:31,749
Kaylie!

914
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,904
Kaylie!

915
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:50,105
Kaylie.

916
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:02,266
Mommy?

917
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:07,066
Tim. Tim look at me.

918
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:13,039
I want you to promise me, that
when we're big and we're strong,

919
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:15,519
we will make this right.

920
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,742
We have to kill that thing.

921
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:28,508
For Mom and Dad.

922
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:34,308
I promise.

923
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:47,705
Kaylie?

924
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:50,745
Kaylie?

925
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:56,182
Kaylie! Kaylie! Kaylie!

926
01:36:57,040 --> 01:37:02,079
Kaylie! Kaylie! Kaylie!

927
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:36,599
He called it in?

928
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:40,950
Yeah, he called 911,
and then he did this.

929
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,944
Where are you taking me?

930
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,279
No, it wasn't my fault!

931
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:54,479
- It was the mirror!
- Tim!

932
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:57,759
Wait! Stop! It wasn't me!

933
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:01,439
It wasn't me. It was the
mirror! It was the mirror!

934
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:03,359
Please! Please! You
have to believe me!

935
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:06,584
It was the mirror!
It was the mirror!

936
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:10,759
Please!

937
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:13,159
Hey! Hey!

938
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:14,759
Don't forget!

939
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:16,903
Don't forget our promise!

940
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,344
Don't forget.
