13
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,535
Cripes! It's old lady Rowe!

14
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:34,163
Come on.

15
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:43,804
<i>Holland?</i>

16
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:47,917
<i>- Holland!
- Keep watch.</i>

17
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:57,061
<i>It's okay. Go ahead.</i>

18
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:02,058
Cripe's sake! Hurry up!

19
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:16,645
- Aha! I finally caught you, Holland Perry!
- I'm Niles!

20
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:20,116
I don't care if you're Franklin
Delano Roosevelt, the dirty Democrat!

21
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:22,346
You stay out of my piccalilli farrago!

22
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,354
Let me go! Let me go!

23
00:05:24,422 --> 00:05:26,356
No sass, boy. No sass!

24
00:05:26,424 --> 00:05:29,416
You're gonna go in there
and clean up that mess. Hear me?

25
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:39,565
Rats! Rats! Rats!

26
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:42,436
Hundreds of rats! My God!

27
00:05:42,507 --> 00:05:45,203
We'll all be down
with bubonic plague!

28
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:48,610
Holland Perry, I'm going to
tell your father on you!

29
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,982
<i>Set your foot on my farm, Holland Perry,
and I'll do more than take my rug beater to ya!</i>

30
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:57,783
<i>Do you hear?
I'm going to tell your father on you!</i>

31
00:05:57,856 --> 00:06:01,348
<i>Geez, someone oughta
tell her Father's dead.</i>

32
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:04,519
Let's go. Apple cellar!

33
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:08,191
Wait! Cousin Piggy's out there.

34
00:06:22,714 --> 00:06:25,114
Hey, Winnie! There's Niles!

35
00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:27,777
Niles!

36
00:06:27,852 --> 00:06:30,787
<i>Niles! Niles Perry,!</i>

37
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:35,189
<i>You know your grandmother doesn't want
you boys playing in that barn!</i>

38
00:06:36,294 --> 00:06:38,922
Niles, do you hear me?

39
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:42,056
<i>You'll miss lunch.</i>

40
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:44,067
Get on up here right now.

41
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:46,865
Niles, files, run 20 miles!

42
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:50,305
<i>Tee-legged, tie-legged,
bow-legged Niles!</i>

43
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,469
Little pitchers has got big lips.

44
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:55,479
- Where you been?
- Around.

45
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:57,481
Hi, Uncle George.

46
00:06:57,549 --> 00:07:00,143
What say, skipper?
Great day for the race, isn't it?

47
00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:03,153
- What race?
- The human race!

48
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:06,290
What's got into Mrs. Rowe?

49
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:08,292
I never heard
such a caterwaulin'.

50
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,352
Thank God I don't have to work
for that crazy old thing.

51
00:07:12,864 --> 00:07:15,298
There's one of
my sunshine boys now.

52
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,301
Hi, Aunt Vee.

53
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:20,304
Why don't you boys set up the card table
in the parlor, where it's cool...

54
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:22,306
and play mah-jongg?

55
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:24,808
Christ, Valeria,
kids don't wanna play mah-jongg.

56
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:28,312
It's summertime.
They wanna go ride old lady Rowe's cow.

57
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,314
<i>Or is that udder nonsense?</i>

58
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:33,317
- Yowsah, yowsah!
- Oh! George!

59
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:35,319
Russell, you'd better go hose off...

60
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:37,821
or you're gonna catch flies.

61
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:40,323
Hey, Rider!

62
00:07:40,392 --> 00:07:42,326
Toonerville Trolley's leaving!

63
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:45,329
Niles, go tell that brother-in-law of yours
to get out here.

64
00:07:45,397 --> 00:07:47,831
- We're both gonna get fired.
- Yowsah!

65
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:50,629
Yowsah! Yowsah!
Yowsah! Yowsah!

66
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:52,863
Yowsah! Yowsah!

67
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,974
Hi, Rider.
Hi, Sis.

68
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:58,976
<i>Hey, kiddo.</i>

69
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:03,276
Eat! I swear, you kids must think
I'm runnin' a restaurant around here.

70
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:06,579
<i>- What's playing at the movies?
- Bet we saw it.</i>

71
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:08,585
I'll bet we didn't.

72
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:11,588
<i>We saw it- Naughty Marietta
and Murder in the Blue Room.</i>

73
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:14,750
<i>- Come on, Rider!
- Comin'!</i>

74
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:17,886
<i>You take care
of the son and heir.</i>

75
00:08:17,962 --> 00:08:20,795
It's not gonna be a boy.
It's gonna be a girl. I told ya!

76
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:23,800
I know you told me,
but you don't say how you know.

77
00:08:23,868 --> 00:08:26,928
He knows. Last year, on Mother's birthday,
he predicted a storm.

78
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:28,939
<i>- And what did we get?
- Hail!</i>

79
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:31,498
Hail Columbia is what somebody's gonna get
if they don't eat.

80
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:33,510
Eat!

81
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:36,513
<i>- Rider!
- Oh, honey, bring home some sarsaparilla.</i>

82
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:39,550
- I have a craving.
- God. Pregnant women.

83
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:42,486
Can I tune in?

84
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:44,545
Sure.

85
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:50,827
Yowsah. It's gonna be a girl.

86
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:53,420
You witch.

87
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:55,432
What's in the oven?

88
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,936
Ah! Them is
your grandmother's surprise.

89
00:08:59,003 --> 00:09:00,937
Eat!

90
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:05,042
Alexandra is ready for lunch.

91
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,044
Yes, ma'am. I know.

92
00:09:07,112 --> 00:09:09,046
Let me take it up.

93
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:11,548
You're gonna have to sit
with Mrs. Alexander.

94
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:14,551
Make her eat.
Otherwise she won't touch a thing.

95
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:17,611
Niles, put the paper
under my arm.

96
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:22,025
Mmm!

97
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:24,357
That'll only upset her.

98
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:27,592
- Tell Mother I'll read to her later.
- All right.

99
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:45,072
Ouch! Oh!

100
00:09:47,585 --> 00:09:49,576
<i>Did ya eat?</i>

101
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:52,919
Did ya eat?

102
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:10,539
Holland.

103
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:12,872
<i>Holland. You in here?</i>

104
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:16,175
<i>Damn you. What are you doing
in the dark anyway?</i>

105
00:10:16,247 --> 00:10:18,943
I'm thinking.
Close the door.

106
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:23,685
<i>Thinking? About what?</i>

107
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:27,782
<i>Old lady Rowe.
Damned old bitch!</i>

108
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:41,962
<i>What is it?</i>

109
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,974
<i>A snowman.</i>

110
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:46,033
<i>Ada made it.</i>

111
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:02,856
People always call it a hawk.

112
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:05,122
It's really a peregrine falcon.

113
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:10,299
Peregrine for Perry.

114
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:12,928
It is my ring, isn't it?

115
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:15,438
You gave it to me, didn't you?

116
00:11:15,506 --> 00:11:19,374
Cripe's sake, yes.
I gave it to ya.

117
00:11:19,444 --> 00:11:21,674
Now, will you forget
about the ring.

118
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:23,270
Just wanted to make sure.

119
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:26,749
Look, the ring
was granddaddy's.

120
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:30,914
When he died, it went to Father,
'cause he was the oldest.

121
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:33,423
Then when Father got killed
I got it...

122
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:35,425
because I was the oldest.

123
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:37,757
Only by 20 minutes.

124
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:39,763
I'm still the oldest.

125
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:42,595
So I can do anything
I want to do with it. Can't I?

126
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:47,434
<i>I told you you can have it.
It's yours, and I don't ever want it back.</i>

127
00:11:52,877 --> 00:11:54,811
What about this?

128
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,177
<i>Shut up about that.</i>

129
00:11:57,248 --> 00:12:00,046
If you ever tell anybody on me-

130
00:12:00,118 --> 00:12:02,109
<i>Shh! Listen!</i>

131
00:12:08,293 --> 00:12:11,228
<i>I thought so.
You are playing in here.</i>

132
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:13,526
<i>You know we're not supposed to.</i>

133
00:12:13,598 --> 00:12:15,532
<i>What's that?</i>

134
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,534
<i>That's Grandpa Perry's ring...</i>

135
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:19,695
<i>and it's supposed
to be buried.</i>

136
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:22,467
I'm gonna tell. You just wait until
my daddy gets home.

137
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,134
<i>You just see if I don't tell.</i>

138
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:36,719
Holland.
H-He saw the ring.

139
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:38,722
I know.

140
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,350
Don't worry, little brother.

141
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:45,385
- He's gonna tell Uncle George.
- No, he's not.

142
00:12:45,463 --> 00:12:48,057
You can have the ring back.

143
00:12:48,132 --> 00:12:50,123
This too.

144
00:12:52,003 --> 00:12:54,028
Take 'em.

145
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:56,903
I don't want 'em, Niles.
I gave 'em to you.

146
00:12:56,975 --> 00:13:00,206
<i>Come on, little brother.
Let's get outta here.</i>

147
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:12,616
<i>Father.</i>

148
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:24,395
<i>- Father.
- Hey, Niles! What you doin'? Now, come on!</i>

149
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:38,772
I'm gonna tell!

150
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:12,772
Only Piggy Lookadoo
would have rats for pets.

151
00:14:12,848 --> 00:14:14,816
<i>Rats for a rat.</i>

152
00:14:20,355 --> 00:14:24,451
Come on, Holland.
Let's get outta here.

153
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:08,192
You killed it, Holland.

154
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,795
<i>You killed it.</i>

155
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:31,349
Mother!

156
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:34,392
<i>Mother!</i>

157
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:39,863
Niles.

158
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:47,700
Mother, you came down.

159
00:15:47,776 --> 00:15:50,074
So I did.

160
00:15:50,145 --> 00:15:52,079
Are these for me?

161
00:15:52,147 --> 00:15:54,843
Yes. Just for you.

162
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,850
How lovely.
From Ada's garden?

163
00:15:56,918 --> 00:15:59,011
Mm-hmm.

164
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:01,920
Mother, come and sit.

165
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,924
Please sit and talk.

166
00:16:03,992 --> 00:16:06,927
- But I'm not dressed.
- No one will see.

167
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:09,987
- Just the two of us.
- All right.

168
00:16:17,973 --> 00:16:20,908
It's all right,
Mother. Please!

169
00:16:20,976 --> 00:16:22,773
No.

170
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:25,108
I can't. Not today.

171
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:32,119
What have you been
doing today?

172
00:16:32,187 --> 00:16:35,350
Oh.

173
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:37,449
Reading, as usual.

174
00:16:37,526 --> 00:16:39,460
<i>You still reading
The Good Earth?</i>

175
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:42,224
<i>Forever The Good Earth.</i>

176
00:16:42,297 --> 00:16:45,198
<i>The librarian says
she'll get Anthony Adverse.</i>

177
00:16:45,267 --> 00:16:47,201
Maybe Monday.

178
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:51,137
Monday.
Now, what's today? Wednesday.

179
00:16:51,206 --> 00:16:53,640
I hope the ashes went out.

180
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:58,442
It's Friday- fish night.
And it's summer.

181
00:16:59,448 --> 00:17:01,177
No ashes.

182
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:03,479
Of course. How stupid!

183
00:17:05,253 --> 00:17:07,687
Your birthdays are in March.

184
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:11,191
I remember.

185
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:14,194
You and Holland both
got those cowboy outfits...

186
00:17:14,262 --> 00:17:17,254
with the fancy stitching
on the boots and-

187
00:17:25,006 --> 00:17:26,803
What's that?

188
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,309
Just some stuff.

189
00:17:29,377 --> 00:17:31,368
It was Father's.

190
00:17:46,862 --> 00:17:49,854
Mother, are you okay?

191
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:53,924
Yes, of course, darling.

192
00:17:55,036 --> 00:17:57,561
<i>Russell!</i>

193
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,131
Russell!

194
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:04,144
Niles, I need a spool
of mercerized cotton.

195
00:18:04,212 --> 00:18:07,147
Can Russell borrow your bicycle
and go to town and get it?

196
00:18:07,215 --> 00:18:10,150
Sure, Aunt Vee,
only it's got a flat.

197
00:18:10,218 --> 00:18:12,652
- Can he borrow Holland's then?
- Sure, Aunt Vee.

198
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:14,552
Thank you, dear.

199
00:18:14,623 --> 00:18:16,420
Russell!

200
00:18:18,126 --> 00:18:20,060
<i>Russell!</i>

201
00:18:20,128 --> 00:18:23,063
<i>Russell, where are you?</i>

202
00:18:23,131 --> 00:18:25,122
<i>Answer me!</i>

203
00:18:35,777 --> 00:18:40,680
<i>I'm king of the mountain!
I'm king of the mountain!</i>

204
00:18:40,749 --> 00:18:44,344
Hey, Piggy! Your mother
wants you to go to the store.

205
00:19:12,147 --> 00:19:15,310
Piggy Lookadoo's
gonna ride your bike!

206
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,498
<i>Dushechka. Dushechka!</i>

207
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:35,127
<i>Baboushka!</i>

208
00:19:49,851 --> 00:19:52,081
<i>Dobryi dyen, baboushka.</i>

209
00:19:52,153 --> 00:19:54,348
<i>Dobryi dyen.</i>

210
00:19:54,422 --> 00:19:58,358
What are you doing there
all by yourself? Did you fish?

211
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:01,020
Not yet.

212
00:20:01,096 --> 00:20:03,030
Summer sure is long.

213
00:20:03,098 --> 00:20:05,862
Life is long, child.

214
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:08,528
I hate shad.

215
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:10,628
I prefer the roe.

216
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:12,639
Roe! Ecch!

217
00:20:12,707 --> 00:20:14,641
Like polliwog eggs.

218
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:18,145
<i>Such a face!
Dushechka, you are a clown.</i>

219
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:21,205
Why do you boys
not play together?

220
00:20:24,352 --> 00:20:27,981
Holland doesn't like
Piggy Lookadoo.

221
00:20:28,056 --> 00:20:30,286
Does he not?

222
00:20:30,358 --> 00:20:33,794
Perhaps summer is long
for Russell too.

223
00:20:33,862 --> 00:20:36,854
Why doesn't Holland
like Russell?

224
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:40,263
Child?

225
00:20:40,335 --> 00:20:42,326
Answer me.

226
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:47,741
Do sunflowers
really follow the sun all day?

227
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:51,802
A Russian superstition, perhaps.

228
00:20:55,183 --> 00:20:57,981
You miss Russia, don't you?

229
00:20:59,054 --> 00:21:01,648
Sometimes.

230
00:21:01,723 --> 00:21:06,956
But God does not mean that we should
miss too much what he takes from us.

231
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:11,865
Besides, now...

232
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:15,096
I have other sunflowers.

233
00:21:18,473 --> 00:21:20,407
Ada...

234
00:21:20,475 --> 00:21:23,308
can I be something else today?

235
00:21:23,378 --> 00:21:26,142
Bigger than a flower.

236
00:21:26,214 --> 00:21:28,148
Please?

237
00:21:28,216 --> 00:21:30,844
Let's play the game.
The great game.

238
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:33,046
The great game, is it?

239
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:36,022
Please? Please?

240
00:21:36,091 --> 00:21:38,025
Very well.

241
00:21:38,093 --> 00:21:40,891
The great game it shall be.

242
00:21:40,962 --> 00:21:42,953
- Oh, boy!
- Come on.

243
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:01,642
Look there, child.

244
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:06,112
<i>Look.</i>

245
00:22:08,356 --> 00:22:10,517
Try to be.

246
00:22:13,561 --> 00:22:17,497
Now think as I have taught you.

247
00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:22,194
Look hard.

248
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:25,000
Feel inside it...

249
00:22:25,073 --> 00:22:28,270
<i>into its head, its heart.</i>

250
00:22:28,343 --> 00:22:31,642
<i>Imagine it, dushechka.</i>

251
00:22:32,647 --> 00:22:34,638
Imagine it.

252
00:22:34,716 --> 00:22:37,844
<i>With all your being...</i>

253
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,854
you do feel.

254
00:22:40,922 --> 00:22:44,085
Now.

255
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,522
Now!

256
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:53,133
<i>Then fly!</i>

257
00:22:55,203 --> 00:22:57,967
<i>Away! Away!</i>

258
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:01,031
<i>Away, child.</i>

259
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,441
<i>It's scary!</i>

260
00:23:10,518 --> 00:23:14,511
<i>Don't be frightened.
What is it like? Tell me!</i>

261
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:16,181
Free!

262
00:23:17,692 --> 00:23:19,660
Mr. Angelini!

263
00:23:19,727 --> 00:23:22,491
<i>Look! Look at me!</i>

264
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,865
Niles, what is it?

265
00:24:03,304 --> 00:24:06,796
- It hurt.
- Where does it hurt? Tell me.

266
00:24:08,776 --> 00:24:11,210
It-

267
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,645
It was just sh-

268
00:24:13,715 --> 00:24:17,207
pointy, all sharp- pointy.

269
00:24:17,285 --> 00:24:19,219
Here.

270
00:24:19,287 --> 00:24:22,347
- Oh.
- I-It's all right, Ada. Honest.

271
00:24:26,694 --> 00:24:28,628
Did I do good?

272
00:24:28,696 --> 00:24:30,630
Oh, very good.

273
00:24:30,698 --> 00:24:34,134
- Good as Holland?
- Better than anyone.

274
00:24:34,202 --> 00:24:36,136
I love you.

275
00:24:36,204 --> 00:24:39,401
Oh, I love you too.

276
00:24:39,474 --> 00:24:42,739
Come now. Let us get you
some root beer.

277
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:47,304
I'm gonna catch a shad
with lots of roe for you!

278
00:24:52,787 --> 00:24:54,618
I'm king of the mountain!

279
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:12,163
I'm sorry, boy.

280
00:26:13,301 --> 00:26:15,292
I'm just so sorry.

281
00:26:16,804 --> 00:26:18,829
It's all right, Mr. Angelini.

282
00:26:19,974 --> 00:26:21,908
It wasn't your fault.

283
00:26:21,976 --> 00:26:23,910
It was an accident.

284
00:27:45,293 --> 00:27:49,423
Oh. Are we going to be able
to go to the firemen's carnival?

285
00:27:49,497 --> 00:27:52,125
Geez! Why not?

286
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,760
Ada says we're in mourning again.

287
00:27:54,836 --> 00:27:57,964
"Ada says. Ada says."

288
00:28:00,641 --> 00:28:02,734
There's seven years bad luck.

289
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:05,802
See what Ada says
about that.

290
00:28:57,865 --> 00:29:00,026
<i>Hurry, folks!</i>

291
00:29:00,101 --> 00:29:02,968
<i>Take home
a five-pound box of candy!</i>

292
00:29:03,037 --> 00:29:05,062
<i>Here it is!
Take home some candy!</i>

293
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:07,232
<i>All rides are 10 cents!</i>

294
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:10,209
<i>Don't you ever get hungry
Get a Coney Island red hot!</i>

295
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:13,509
<i>- And help yourself to the mustard!</i>

296
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:17,381
<i>Big, fat and juicy Coney Island red hots!
And cold drinks, folks!</i>

297
00:29:17,452 --> 00:29:20,387
<i>All right, folks, come over!</i>

298
00:29:20,455 --> 00:29:23,390
<i>Tell you what you're
gonna see on this side!</i>

299
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:26,393
<i>From the four corners of the world,
and at great expense to the management...</i>

300
00:29:26,461 --> 00:29:30,090
<i>we have brought together some of the most
unusual attractions ever seen under one roof...</i>

301
00:29:30,164 --> 00:29:32,496
and all for the price
of one admission.

302
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:34,501
<i>You're going to meet Big Bertha!</i>

303
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:38,005
Four hundred and fifty pounds
of beauty on the hoof.

304
00:29:38,072 --> 00:29:41,166
Yes, sir, she shimmies,
she shakes like a bowl of jelly.

305
00:29:41,242 --> 00:29:44,177
<i>And as an extra added attraction,
ladies and gentlemen...</i>

306
00:29:44,245 --> 00:29:47,180
<i>we're going to bring to you
nature's cruelest trick-</i>

307
00:29:47,248 --> 00:29:49,182
the hydrocephalic baby,
ladies and gentlemen.

308
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:52,184
Plus Mr. And Mrs. Katz-

309
00:29:52,317 --> 00:29:53,750
<i>- Niles! Come on!</i>

310
00:29:53,818 --> 00:29:55,945
<i>- Plus Bo-Jo, the dog-faced boy!
- Come on!</i>

311
00:29:56,021 --> 00:29:59,752
<i>Plus the two-faced man!
All on the inside, ladies and gentlemen!</i>

312
00:29:59,824 --> 00:30:01,758
<i>All for the price
of one admission!</i>

313
00:30:01,826 --> 00:30:05,694
<i>- We're gonna get caught!
- Damn it, Niles. Come on!</i>

314
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:07,698
Oh, damn!

315
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:09,757
<i>Hurry, hurry, hurry,!</i>

316
00:30:53,712 --> 00:30:56,476
<i>Fun house!
More fun than a circus!</i>

317
00:30:56,548 --> 00:30:59,676
<i>Come in! Stay as long as you like!
Come out when you're ready!</i>

318
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:12,861
Come on, Holland. Let's scram.

319
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:27,835
<i>- Holland! Holland! Wait!</i>

320
00:31:55,473 --> 00:31:58,135
<i>- Hold on!</i>

321
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:03,513
- Shh.
- What's going on?

322
00:32:03,581 --> 00:32:05,708
I'm waiting for her
to disappear.

323
00:32:05,784 --> 00:32:09,049
Don't be a dumbbell.
No one can do that.

324
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,419
I know! I wanna find out
how he does it.

325
00:32:16,294 --> 00:32:18,728
<i>It's just a stupid trick.</i>

326
00:32:18,797 --> 00:32:21,561
He ain't even a Chinese.

327
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:23,567
He's got tape on his eyes.

328
00:32:23,635 --> 00:32:25,569
<i>So? Come on. Let's go.</i>

329
00:32:25,637 --> 00:32:28,367
<i>No, wait!
I gotta figure it out.</i>

330
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,876
- Yeah? How?
- I'll play the game on him.

331
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:53,355
Damn phony.

332
00:33:56,728 --> 00:34:00,323
<i>- We saw a magician today.
- Oh, did you, now?</i>

333
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:02,263
Only it was a dumb fake.

334
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,267
How do you know this?

335
00:34:04,335 --> 00:34:07,771
I played the game on him
and figured out the trick.

336
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:13,277
Holland didn't believe me.
But I really did. It was easy.

337
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:15,710
I mean, sometimes
it's so easy...

338
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,715
it doesn't seem like
I'm doing it at all.

339
00:34:18,783 --> 00:34:21,718
It is a special game
for special people.

340
00:34:21,786 --> 00:34:24,721
<i>My baboushka taught me,
and I taught you children.</i>

341
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:27,223
But sometimes
I don't know how I do it.

342
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:29,226
Of course you know.

343
00:34:29,294 --> 00:34:32,695
I've told you.
There is no trick to it. Just imagination.

344
00:34:32,764 --> 00:34:36,564
<i>But do not play the game
too much, dushechka. Da?</i>

345
00:34:36,634 --> 00:34:39,797
There are other things
in life besides the game.

346
00:34:39,871 --> 00:34:42,669
And children should play
with other children.

347
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,674
But I like to play
with Holland.

348
00:34:44,742 --> 00:34:47,643
But you should make
other friends.

349
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:49,475
Holland's my friend.

350
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:52,038
Sing to me, please.

351
00:34:54,118 --> 00:34:56,109
Oh.

352
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:26,547
Now it is time for
all good boys to be in bed.

353
00:35:26,618 --> 00:35:28,609
Butterfly kiss?

354
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:36,890
<i>And tomorrow...</i>

355
00:35:36,961 --> 00:35:39,759
it will be time for all bad boys...

356
00:35:39,831 --> 00:35:41,765
to make apologies to Mrs. Rowe.

357
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:44,358
<i>I saw her today.</i>

358
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:46,369
And in the morning...

359
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:50,305
her damaged preserves
will be replaced in person...

360
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:53,208
<i>by the one responsible.</i>

361
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:56,413
I'll tell Holland.

362
00:35:56,481 --> 00:35:58,813
<i>Please be sure he understands.</i>

363
00:36:28,846 --> 00:36:31,906
<i>I'm coming!</i>

364
00:36:31,983 --> 00:36:34,178
Good afternoon, madam.

365
00:36:34,252 --> 00:36:36,914
What is this? Halloween?

366
00:36:36,988 --> 00:36:38,922
- This is for you.
- For me?

367
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,924
What is it?

368
00:36:40,992 --> 00:36:42,926
- For the piccalilli I broke.
- Piccalilli?

369
00:36:42,994 --> 00:36:46,589
- And I came to apologize.
- Oh, I remember you.

370
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:49,326
- Where's the other one?
- Niles won't come.

371
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,131
He says I broke it,
so I had to apologize.

372
00:36:53,204 --> 00:36:55,195
Huh. I accept it.

373
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:58,642
May I come in, please?

374
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,645
- You want to come in?
- Yes, please.

375
00:37:01,713 --> 00:37:03,647
Well, all right.

376
00:37:03,715 --> 00:37:05,649
You can come in.

377
00:37:09,821 --> 00:37:11,755
My, my.

378
00:37:11,823 --> 00:37:14,758
You boys have grown so.

379
00:37:14,826 --> 00:37:16,987
- Here you are.
- Thank you, ma'am.

380
00:37:34,612 --> 00:37:37,911
You're musical!

381
00:37:37,982 --> 00:37:39,813
I play the piano.

382
00:37:39,884 --> 00:37:43,012
- I can do tricks too.
- What kind of tricks?

383
00:37:43,087 --> 00:37:46,181
Shh.
I'll show you.

384
00:37:46,257 --> 00:37:48,487
All right.

385
00:37:58,269 --> 00:38:00,100
What are you doing there, Holland?

386
00:38:00,171 --> 00:38:03,902
Shh. It's a better light
for the trick.

387
00:38:03,975 --> 00:38:06,273
Oh.

388
00:38:09,814 --> 00:38:12,442
Shh.

389
00:38:23,828 --> 00:38:26,228
You're very mysterious, aren't you?

390
00:38:26,297 --> 00:38:29,232
Shh.

391
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,202
<i>You're not going to pull
a rabbit out of there, are you?</i>

392
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:34,966
No. Guess again.

393
00:39:39,137 --> 00:39:41,071
I got your pain pills.

394
00:39:41,139 --> 00:39:43,801
Oh, my child, thank you.

395
00:39:47,345 --> 00:39:49,836
Why do people have to die?

396
00:39:51,182 --> 00:39:54,948
Well, all of life must die.

397
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:56,953
'Tis nature's way.

398
00:39:57,021 --> 00:39:58,955
Every bird...

399
00:39:59,023 --> 00:40:00,957
every tree, every flower...

400
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:02,959
has its time.

401
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:05,154
They put you in the ground.

402
00:40:05,229 --> 00:40:09,666
As we come from the earth,
so we are returned to it.

403
00:40:09,734 --> 00:40:12,726
I don't like
to think about that.

404
00:40:17,308 --> 00:40:19,742
When I was very young,
like you...

405
00:40:19,811 --> 00:40:22,746
I was frightened
of death too.

406
00:40:22,814 --> 00:40:25,749
So, to set my mind at peace...

407
00:40:25,817 --> 00:40:30,447
<i>my baboushka told me when it came
time to die I must not be afraid.</i>

408
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:32,512
I must look for an angel...

409
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:35,525
who would come from paradise.

410
00:40:35,593 --> 00:40:37,993
And this angel would smile...

411
00:40:38,062 --> 00:40:41,361
and fold me
in her beautiful white wings...

412
00:40:41,432 --> 00:40:43,423
and carry me off to heaven.

413
00:40:44,836 --> 00:40:49,830
<i>Baboushka called her-</i>

414
00:40:49,907 --> 00:40:51,841
Which means...

415
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:54,844
"the angel of the brighter day."

416
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:57,847
And from that time
I was no longer afraid of death.

417
00:40:57,915 --> 00:40:59,849
You see?

418
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:01,782
And when I came here...

419
00:41:01,853 --> 00:41:04,515
and found this church...

420
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:07,717
this angel became for me...

421
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:10,226
<i>the angel of the brighter day.</i>

422
00:41:10,294 --> 00:41:12,728
<i>You see?</i>

423
00:41:14,498 --> 00:41:17,899
Do you still believe
she will come?

424
00:41:17,969 --> 00:41:19,903
Oh, yes.

425
00:41:19,971 --> 00:41:23,031
Will the angel come for me
when I die?

426
00:41:23,107 --> 00:41:25,905
If you believe...

427
00:41:25,977 --> 00:41:28,138
then surely she will.

428
00:41:45,396 --> 00:41:48,593
<i>Thank you, Mr. Clifford.</i>

429
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:50,657
Thank you, sir.

430
00:42:01,445 --> 00:42:03,174
Alexandra.

431
00:42:07,685 --> 00:42:10,677
Mr. Angelini,
can I borrow your clippers?

432
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:21,590
Thank you, Mr. Angelini.

433
00:42:25,002 --> 00:42:29,496
<i>Here's the Anthony Adverse
at last!</i>

434
00:42:29,573 --> 00:42:32,667
Thank you.
It's positively gargantuan!

435
00:42:32,743 --> 00:42:35,906
It'll take me all summer
to read this.

436
00:42:36,948 --> 00:42:39,382
I'll read to ya.

437
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:42,385
When you were younger,
I used to read to you two.

438
00:42:42,453 --> 00:42:44,387
Now you read to me.

439
00:42:44,455 --> 00:42:47,390
What was that story
you both used to love so?

440
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:51,394
The one about the pig that got roasted with
an apple in his mouth- poor, greedy thing.

441
00:42:51,462 --> 00:42:53,396
One of Holland's favorites.

442
00:42:53,464 --> 00:42:55,557
That was Piggy Lookadoo.

443
00:42:56,567 --> 00:42:58,501
But Holland's real favorite...

444
00:42:58,569 --> 00:43:00,503
was the story
of the changeling.

445
00:43:00,571 --> 00:43:03,938
You know, the fairy tale
about the elves stealing the baby?

446
00:43:04,008 --> 00:43:06,943
It's a horrid story.
I don't like things like that.

447
00:43:07,011 --> 00:43:09,445
<i>- What about Uncle Tom's Cabin?
- Terrific!</i>

448
00:43:09,513 --> 00:43:12,107
Eliza crossing the ice
carrying her baby...

449
00:43:12,183 --> 00:43:15,277
and the dogs chasing her,
and then Simon Legree with his whip...

450
00:43:15,353 --> 00:43:17,287
and Topsy's eating watermelon...

451
00:43:17,355 --> 00:43:19,789
and little Eva dies
and goes to heaven.

452
00:43:19,857 --> 00:43:21,825
- Remember?
- I remember.

453
00:43:21,892 --> 00:43:25,521
And you said to me,
"Mother, what did you do in the Civil War?"

454
00:43:30,568 --> 00:43:32,866
Are you hoping?

455
00:43:34,171 --> 00:43:36,867
Yes, darling, I'm hoping.

456
00:43:36,941 --> 00:43:39,569
Everything is going
to be all right now.

457
00:43:39,643 --> 00:43:42,077
Everything's going to be all right.

458
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,014
- Guess what.
- What?

459
00:43:45,082 --> 00:43:48,017
We're gonna have another show
in the barn this summer.

460
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:50,019
A magic show with a trick.

461
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:52,453
- What kind of a trick?
- I can't tell.

462
00:43:52,523 --> 00:43:54,957
<i>We want it to be a surprise.</i>

463
00:43:55,026 --> 00:43:56,960
<i>Oh!</i>

464
00:43:57,028 --> 00:43:58,962
I have a present for you.

465
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:02,625
- Another present?
- Close your eyes. Come on.

466
00:44:18,716 --> 00:44:22,709
Okay. You can open 'em now.

467
00:44:23,954 --> 00:44:27,617
Guess which one.
Left or right?

468
00:44:30,694 --> 00:44:33,629
- Left.
- Wrong.

469
00:44:33,697 --> 00:44:35,688
Open it.

470
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:40,069
You have to warm them up.

471
00:44:40,137 --> 00:44:42,298
<i>It only takes a second.</i>

472
00:44:47,211 --> 00:44:50,146
They're Mexican
jumping beans, Mother.

473
00:44:50,214 --> 00:44:52,580
Don't you think
they're cheerful?

474
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:55,141
Yes, very.

475
00:45:04,925 --> 00:45:07,189
- Niles.
- Hmm?

476
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:09,525
Do you know what this is?

477
00:45:09,597 --> 00:45:12,589
<i>Sure.
It's the family crest.</i>

478
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:14,861
A peregrine falcon.

479
00:45:14,935 --> 00:45:16,869
"Peregrine" for Perry.

480
00:45:16,937 --> 00:45:19,030
Like the weather vane?

481
00:45:19,106 --> 00:45:20,937
Mm-hmm.

482
00:45:21,008 --> 00:45:22,942
And the ring?

483
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:24,944
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

484
00:45:27,014 --> 00:45:28,982
Here comes the vegetable man!

485
00:45:29,049 --> 00:45:31,449
<i>Corn and beans! Corn and beans!</i>

486
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,453
Succotash time!

487
00:45:33,521 --> 00:45:36,854
I gotta get Mr. Pretty his root beer,
or he'll have a conniption!

488
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,194
Don't you dare track dirt in.

489
00:45:41,262 --> 00:45:43,253
I just washed my linoleum.

490
00:46:05,553 --> 00:46:07,487
Here you go, Mr. Pretty!

491
00:46:07,555 --> 00:46:10,490
Well, thank you, Niles.
That'll sure wet my whistle.

492
00:46:10,558 --> 00:46:13,493
- Here.
- Thank you, Mr. Pretty!

493
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:16,121
<i>- Now where you goin'?
- Swimming!</i>

494
00:46:17,932 --> 00:46:21,368
You know,
I been wonderin' all week-

495
00:46:21,435 --> 00:46:24,370
Your neighbor lady,
she go away or somethin'?

496
00:46:24,438 --> 00:46:27,032
Mrs. Rowe?
That's what we been wonderin'.

497
00:46:27,107 --> 00:46:30,042
Well, usually she boils up
a mess of tripe on Fridays...

498
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:33,045
and I bring her
some dandelion greens for it.

499
00:46:33,113 --> 00:46:35,308
But I can't raise a soul.

500
00:46:35,382 --> 00:46:37,646
Well, between you and me...

501
00:46:38,919 --> 00:46:42,082
I don't think Mrs. Rowe's
such a good housekeeper.

502
00:46:42,156 --> 00:46:45,148
You wouldn't believe
the smell over there.

503
00:46:46,427 --> 00:46:48,691
<i>Let me have
a couple of cakes.</i>

504
00:46:48,762 --> 00:46:50,696
Swiss chard's nice today.

505
00:46:50,764 --> 00:46:53,164
<i>Mrs. Alexander
don't like Swiss chard.</i>

506
00:47:08,582 --> 00:47:11,517
Going for a dip.
Be back soon.

507
00:47:44,451 --> 00:47:47,386
<i>What's the last thing
you'd like to see...</i>

508
00:47:47,454 --> 00:47:49,388
<i>before you die?</i>

509
00:47:49,456 --> 00:47:51,390
<i>The last thing?</i>

510
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:54,393
<i>I mean, if there was
one very last thing...</i>

511
00:47:54,461 --> 00:47:58,397
you could wish to see
before you die, what would it be?

512
00:47:58,465 --> 00:48:00,399
<i>Listen...</i>

513
00:48:00,467 --> 00:48:02,332
<i>if I was dying...</i>

514
00:48:02,403 --> 00:48:07,306
<i>I'd be too busy doing just that,
and so would you.</i>

515
00:48:07,374 --> 00:48:10,104
I'd wish to see...

516
00:48:10,177 --> 00:48:12,111
her.

517
00:48:12,179 --> 00:48:15,615
- See who?
- The angel.

518
00:48:15,683 --> 00:48:19,517
You know.
Ada's angel in the church.

519
00:48:20,988 --> 00:48:23,616
Just before I died...

520
00:48:23,691 --> 00:48:26,285
the angel
would swoop down...

521
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,090
and take me in her wings...

522
00:48:29,163 --> 00:48:32,064
and carry me off to heaven.

523
00:48:32,132 --> 00:48:34,066
That's what Ada says.

524
00:48:34,134 --> 00:48:38,833
- How do you know she wouldn't take you to hell?
- Angels don't go to hell.

525
00:48:38,906 --> 00:48:41,841
Only bad people do.

526
00:48:53,654 --> 00:48:56,350
<i>Come on, Niles, will ya!</i>

527
00:48:56,423 --> 00:48:58,357
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

528
00:48:58,425 --> 00:49:00,825
<i>I'm coming! I'm coming!</i>

529
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:18,173
<i>That damn Uncle George.</i>

530
00:49:18,245 --> 00:49:21,180
<i>He said he was gonna do it,
and he did.</i>

531
00:49:21,248 --> 00:49:23,239
Come on.

532
00:49:54,415 --> 00:49:57,578
<i>Hey, Holland,
we get enough of this stuff...</i>

533
00:49:57,651 --> 00:50:01,246
we could use it to catch us
when we do the magic show.

534
00:50:01,321 --> 00:50:04,586
<i>You know, like a mattress.
Know what I mean?</i>

535
00:50:04,658 --> 00:50:08,185
There isn't gonna be
any magic show. Not now.

536
00:50:08,262 --> 00:50:10,196
Why not?

537
00:50:10,264 --> 00:50:12,198
Figure it out, little brother.

538
00:50:12,266 --> 00:50:14,496
Think it all out.

539
00:50:14,568 --> 00:50:17,503
We build the stage
over the trap door...

540
00:50:17,571 --> 00:50:20,506
you turn the cabinet,
I drop down...

541
00:50:20,574 --> 00:50:22,508
<i>and then what happens?</i>

542
00:50:22,576 --> 00:50:25,511
You run out,
around the back stairs...

543
00:50:25,579 --> 00:50:29,515
and appear in the audience
like Chan-Yu did.

544
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:33,110
<i>- Okay, how do I run out?
- Through there.</i>

545
00:50:34,954 --> 00:50:36,819
Through here?

546
00:50:41,427 --> 00:50:44,726
See what I mean?
That damn Uncle George.

547
00:50:46,065 --> 00:50:49,466
Well, we're gonna need
more cattails anyway.

548
00:50:49,535 --> 00:50:51,469
Lots of 'em.

549
00:50:51,537 --> 00:50:53,129
So let's get 'em.

550
00:50:54,207 --> 00:50:55,936
<i>Come on.</i>

551
00:51:05,384 --> 00:51:09,115
<i>Hey! Come on, will ya!</i>

552
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:15,724
Niles, we will eat soon.
Go wash. Put on some clothes.

553
00:51:15,795 --> 00:51:18,457
Right now?

554
00:51:20,299 --> 00:51:22,733
- Where are you going?
- To Mrs. Rowe.

555
00:51:22,802 --> 00:51:25,737
She's alone over there
and may have taken sick.

556
00:51:25,805 --> 00:51:29,036
Can I come?

557
00:52:08,114 --> 00:52:10,048
No! Child, don't look.

558
00:52:10,116 --> 00:52:13,711
Run. Go get your Uncle George.
Tell him to call the constable.

559
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,994
<i>She's dead!</i>

560
00:52:23,062 --> 00:52:24,996
- Who? Who?
- Who's dead?

561
00:52:25,064 --> 00:52:27,999
Old lady Rowe-
l-I mean, Mrs. Rowe!

562
00:52:28,067 --> 00:52:30,001
- Ada says come!
- Oh, my God.

563
00:52:30,069 --> 00:52:32,003
And call the constable!

564
00:52:32,071 --> 00:52:35,006
<i>- George. George!
- Get on the phone.</i>

565
00:52:35,074 --> 00:52:38,009
<i>George, come here!</i>

566
00:52:38,077 --> 00:52:41,638
- George, Mrs. Rowe is dead,
and Ada's over there alone.
- I'll be right there.

567
00:52:41,714 --> 00:52:43,648
Evelyn? It's Torrie Gannon.

568
00:52:43,716 --> 00:52:47,709
We've had some more trouble over here.
Can you locate the constable?

569
00:52:47,787 --> 00:52:50,722
<i>When you find him,
have him come to Mrs. Rowe's house...</i>

570
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:52,917
<i>out on Valley Hill Road
right away.</i>

571
00:52:52,992 --> 00:52:55,324
<i>It's urgent. Thank you.</i>

572
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,054
<i>I told ya! I told ya!</i>

573
00:53:23,122 --> 00:53:25,556
I knew someone
would find that stuff!

574
00:53:25,624 --> 00:53:28,525
Goddamn it, Niles!
I told ya!

575
00:53:28,594 --> 00:53:30,528
You said she'd never find 'em.

576
00:53:30,596 --> 00:53:32,530
You said put 'em in the desk!

577
00:53:32,598 --> 00:53:36,193
- You said she'd never come in here!
- Never mind what I said.

578
00:53:36,268 --> 00:53:38,259
She found it, and she's got it.

579
00:53:38,337 --> 00:53:41,272
<i>She's got it, little brother...</i>

580
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:43,934
<i>and you'd better get it back.</i>

581
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:45,944
Get it back.

582
00:53:46,012 --> 00:53:48,105
I mean it.

583
00:53:53,953 --> 00:53:58,219
<i>Tell her you want it. It's yours.
It doesn't belong to her.</i>

584
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:01,953
It was Father's ring.
I gave it to you. It's not hers.

585
00:54:03,329 --> 00:54:07,663
Yeah, but it's supposed to be buried.
She knows that.

586
00:54:18,477 --> 00:54:20,411
What are we gonna do?

587
00:54:20,479 --> 00:54:22,674
<i>I told you what to do.
Get it back.</i>

588
00:54:40,232 --> 00:54:42,860
Mother.

589
00:54:44,937 --> 00:54:47,735
Mother, come away.

590
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:50,105
Mother, please.

591
00:54:50,176 --> 00:54:52,167
Please, Mother.

592
00:55:14,133 --> 00:55:17,625
Mother, you hurt your hand.

593
00:55:19,205 --> 00:55:21,139
Oh, Mother.

594
00:55:21,207 --> 00:55:23,971
You found the tobacco tin.

595
00:55:25,377 --> 00:55:27,504
L-I'm sorry.

596
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:30,208
Niles...

597
00:55:30,282 --> 00:55:33,217
what are you doing
with Father's ring?

598
00:55:33,285 --> 00:55:36,379
It was supposed
to have been buried.

599
00:55:36,455 --> 00:55:38,548
<i>Yes, Mother.</i>

600
00:55:38,624 --> 00:55:40,558
But-

601
00:55:40,626 --> 00:55:44,562
Tell me, Niles, please.
What are you doing with the ring?

602
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:47,724
- It's mine.
- Yours?

603
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,734
How can it be yours?

604
00:55:49,802 --> 00:55:51,861
Holland gave it to me.

605
00:55:54,006 --> 00:55:56,736
H-He did, Mother. Honest.

606
00:55:56,809 --> 00:55:59,073
When?

607
00:55:59,145 --> 00:56:01,978
<i>When did Holland
give you the ring?</i>

608
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:04,845
- In March.
- March?

609
00:56:04,917 --> 00:56:07,010
<i>When in March?</i>

610
00:56:07,086 --> 00:56:09,020
After our birthdays.

611
00:56:09,088 --> 00:56:13,024
After your... birthdays?

612
00:56:13,092 --> 00:56:15,720
<i>Where, Niles?</i>

613
00:56:15,794 --> 00:56:20,390
In the name of heaven, where was Holland
when he gave you the ring?

614
00:56:20,466 --> 00:56:22,366
We were in the front parlor.

615
00:56:22,434 --> 00:56:24,766
Did he give you this too?

616
00:56:28,174 --> 00:56:31,007
<i>Yes, I gave it to him.</i>

617
00:56:31,076 --> 00:56:33,067
Now give it back, Mother.

618
00:56:47,459 --> 00:56:51,259
<i>Ada! Ada!</i>

619
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:53,397
<i>Ada!</i>

620
00:56:55,799 --> 00:56:57,824
<i>Mother-she fell!</i>

621
00:57:22,092 --> 00:57:24,287
<i>What's the matter, little brother?</i>

622
00:57:24,361 --> 00:57:26,295
Leave me alone.

623
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:29,696
Mother's gonna be all right.
You'll see.

624
00:57:29,766 --> 00:57:31,825
She can't walk anymore.

625
00:57:31,902 --> 00:57:34,200
She can't even talk.

626
00:57:35,772 --> 00:57:37,706
She's paralyzed.

627
00:57:37,774 --> 00:57:40,766
<i>- Who says?
- Everybody.</i>

628
00:57:40,844 --> 00:57:42,869
You heard the doctor.

629
00:57:42,946 --> 00:57:45,176
<i>What does he know?</i>

630
00:57:45,248 --> 00:57:48,513
She'll get better.
Wait and see.

631
00:57:52,189 --> 00:57:54,521
It was just an accident.

632
00:58:14,811 --> 00:58:16,540
Niles?

633
00:58:17,614 --> 00:58:19,639
<i>Niles!</i>

634
00:58:55,118 --> 00:58:57,109
Are you all right, child?

635
00:58:59,723 --> 00:59:01,657
Yes.

636
00:59:02,993 --> 00:59:04,984
I do not think so.

637
00:59:05,061 --> 00:59:07,529
Tell me.

638
00:59:07,597 --> 00:59:09,792
Tell Ada, please.

639
00:59:11,668 --> 00:59:14,535
I get scared sometimes.

640
00:59:14,604 --> 00:59:16,663
What frightens you?

641
00:59:18,608 --> 00:59:20,599
I don't know.

642
00:59:24,514 --> 00:59:29,417
Sometimes we are frightened of things
we do not know.

643
00:59:29,486 --> 00:59:31,420
But when
we speak of them...

644
00:59:31,488 --> 00:59:34,548
we see there is nothing there
to be afraid of.

645
00:59:36,626 --> 00:59:38,651
He's there.

646
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:42,589
Who?

647
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,968
Holland.

648
00:59:46,036 --> 00:59:48,231
Holland scares me.

649
00:59:56,046 --> 00:59:58,037
Niles.

650
00:59:59,983 --> 01:00:03,441
This is Holland's harmonica,
is it not?

651
01:00:05,822 --> 01:00:08,882
Yes. He said he lost it.

652
01:00:10,961 --> 01:00:14,089
Do you know
where I found it?

653
01:00:14,164 --> 01:00:16,155
No.

654
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,768
At Mrs. Rowe's house.

655
01:00:23,373 --> 01:00:25,933
Do you know
how Mrs. Rowe died?

656
01:00:28,578 --> 01:00:30,978
She had a heart attack.

657
01:00:32,282 --> 01:00:36,082
D-Did Holland go to
visit her that day?

658
01:00:36,152 --> 01:00:41,317
He went over, like you said,
and a- and apologized.

659
01:00:42,792 --> 01:00:44,851
And?

660
01:00:44,928 --> 01:00:48,955
And he said Mrs. Rowe
gave him cookies and lemonade.

661
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,468
It was an accident. Honest.

662
01:00:52,535 --> 01:00:56,062
He didn't mean to.
It was just a game.

663
01:00:56,139 --> 01:00:58,107
Go on.

664
01:00:58,174 --> 01:01:01,109
He was mad at her
'cause she told on him.

665
01:01:01,177 --> 01:01:05,204
So he played a trick on her
with a rat to scare her.

666
01:01:05,281 --> 01:01:09,081
I told him.
I told him don't.

667
01:01:09,152 --> 01:01:12,519
- He doesn't mean to be bad, but sometimes-
- Stop it!

668
01:01:12,589 --> 01:01:15,922
It's true. It's true.

669
01:01:15,992 --> 01:01:19,223
He's bad, but he doesn't mean to be.

670
01:01:19,295 --> 01:01:22,492
- Honest.
- Enough now.

671
01:01:22,565 --> 01:01:24,897
I shall not hear anymore.

672
01:01:24,968 --> 01:01:26,993
Come.

673
01:01:40,483 --> 01:01:44,180
- Now, child, tell me what you see.
- No, no!

674
01:01:44,254 --> 01:01:46,279
- Look there and tell me.
- No!

675
01:01:46,356 --> 01:01:48,381
No. No.

676
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:52,258
Very well.
Very well then.

677
01:01:58,702 --> 01:02:00,670
Play the game with me.

678
01:02:00,737 --> 01:02:02,705
Please, child.
Play the game.

679
01:02:02,772 --> 01:02:04,797
I don't want to
play the game. Please!

680
01:02:04,874 --> 01:02:07,536
You must.

681
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:09,601
Concentrate.

682
01:02:13,283 --> 01:02:15,342
There.

683
01:02:22,192 --> 01:02:25,593
Now tell me,
what is it like?

684
01:02:29,766 --> 01:02:31,825
Cold.

685
01:02:31,901 --> 01:02:33,926
What else?

686
01:02:35,872 --> 01:02:37,897
Dark.

687
01:02:37,974 --> 01:02:40,374
Dark? How?

688
01:02:40,443 --> 01:02:42,536
Dark...

689
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,810
l-like the apple cellar.

690
01:02:46,883 --> 01:02:49,078
It's a prison.

691
01:02:49,152 --> 01:02:51,211
I can't get out.

692
01:02:51,287 --> 01:02:54,848
It's locked.
I want to get out, but I can't.

693
01:02:54,924 --> 01:02:57,119
Tell me what you see.

694
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:05,393
I see a box.

695
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:09,329
Black.

696
01:03:10,707 --> 01:03:12,868
Handles.

697
01:03:15,612 --> 01:03:17,773
The box is wood.

698
01:03:17,847 --> 01:03:20,645
Mahogany. It's-

699
01:03:21,718 --> 01:03:23,879
- It's a-
- Go on!

700
01:03:23,953 --> 01:03:26,615
It's a...

701
01:03:26,689 --> 01:03:28,623
coffin.

702
01:03:28,691 --> 01:03:30,716
Go on. Further.

703
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:35,558
I see a face.

704
01:03:35,632 --> 01:03:37,657
Whose face?

705
01:03:39,536 --> 01:03:42,869
- I don't want to!
- You shall. You must!

706
01:03:42,939 --> 01:03:46,204
Holland! Holland!

707
01:03:46,276 --> 01:03:48,244
Holland, help me, please!

708
01:03:48,311 --> 01:03:50,336
Say the truth! Now!

709
01:03:50,413 --> 01:03:53,507
Out loud, so we
shall both hear it.

710
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:56,017
Holland is dead!

711
01:03:56,085 --> 01:03:59,646
Remember?
On his birthday.

712
01:03:59,722 --> 01:04:02,520
He is dead, Niles!

713
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,528
Remember?

714
01:04:05,595 --> 01:04:07,927
Remember?

715
01:04:23,913 --> 01:04:26,381
Holland!

716
01:04:27,517 --> 01:04:29,576
Holland! Holland!

717
01:04:29,652 --> 01:04:33,383
Holland! Holland!

718
01:04:38,428 --> 01:04:41,454
Oh. Oh.

719
01:05:30,613 --> 01:05:32,945
Are you all right, child?

720
01:05:34,517 --> 01:05:36,451
<i>Da.</i>

721
01:05:36,519 --> 01:05:38,851
<i>Da.</i>

722
01:05:39,989 --> 01:05:42,651
Oh, child, I am so sorry.

723
01:05:43,893 --> 01:05:46,521
<i>But you had to
see the truth.</i>

724
01:05:48,131 --> 01:05:50,599
It was only a game.

725
01:05:50,667 --> 01:05:52,635
We were playing a game,
you and I...

726
01:05:52,702 --> 01:05:55,603
like all the other games
we play.

727
01:05:55,672 --> 01:05:58,869
Only the time has come
for all the games to stop.

728
01:05:58,942 --> 01:06:01,809
It is wrong, you see?

729
01:06:01,878 --> 01:06:03,869
Dangerous.

730
01:06:05,915 --> 01:06:08,941
<i>Oh, my dushechka.</i>

731
01:06:09,018 --> 01:06:13,785
I could not bear to see you so unhappy,
to watch you all alone...

732
01:06:13,856 --> 01:06:16,154
so I pretended with you.

733
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:19,928
I pretended Holland was alive...

734
01:06:19,996 --> 01:06:22,521
because you wanted it so.

735
01:06:23,933 --> 01:06:28,233
I thought in time
such fantasies would pass...

736
01:06:28,304 --> 01:06:31,671
<i>and you would come
to see the real world.</i>

737
01:06:31,741 --> 01:06:35,074
Have I seen
the real world yet?

738
01:06:36,646 --> 01:06:39,240
Da, dushechka.

739
01:06:39,315 --> 01:06:41,476
I know it now.

740
01:06:42,685 --> 01:06:47,088
Your world is very real...

741
01:06:47,156 --> 01:06:49,386
for you.

742
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:53,060
Only I could not see.

743
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:56,389
Perhaps I could,
but I would not see.

744
01:06:56,466 --> 01:06:59,560
It was wrong of me
to want you to play the game.

745
01:06:59,635 --> 01:07:02,661
The wrong was mine
because I taught you.

746
01:07:02,739 --> 01:07:06,766
Oh, God,
I have done this thing. I-

747
01:07:06,843 --> 01:07:09,073
Oh.

748
01:07:09,145 --> 01:07:12,273
I did not know
how far it had gone.

749
01:07:14,317 --> 01:07:16,547
It was only
because I loved you.

750
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:19,679
Do you still love me?

751
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:23,752
Child.

752
01:07:23,826 --> 01:07:26,021
I have not loved
your mother...

753
01:07:26,095 --> 01:07:28,825
more than
I have loved you.

754
01:07:28,898 --> 01:07:31,230
There is nothing in my life...

755
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:34,292
I have loved
more than you- nothing.

756
01:07:36,439 --> 01:07:40,136
But everything
is different now.

757
01:07:40,209 --> 01:07:42,268
It is different now.

758
01:07:43,746 --> 01:07:46,772
Nothing can ever
be the same.

759
01:07:46,849 --> 01:07:49,875
Not for any of us.

760
01:07:49,952 --> 01:07:52,682
Everything has gone too far.

761
01:07:52,755 --> 01:07:55,588
It must stop now.

762
01:07:56,692 --> 01:07:59,126
Are you going to
send me away?

763
01:08:00,263 --> 01:08:02,356
Away?

764
01:08:02,432 --> 01:08:05,993
Why?
Where would you go?

765
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:09,061
Away.

766
01:08:11,174 --> 01:08:13,142
<i>No, dushechka.</i>

767
01:08:13,209 --> 01:08:17,771
You shall never be sent away.

768
01:08:18,881 --> 01:08:21,213
We'll be together always?

769
01:08:21,284 --> 01:08:23,275
<i>Always.</i>

770
01:08:25,054 --> 01:08:27,386
Always!

771
01:08:33,529 --> 01:08:37,329
<i>But no more games. Da?</i>

772
01:08:40,203 --> 01:08:42,194
<i>Da.</i>

773
01:08:43,773 --> 01:08:45,798
Sleep now.

774
01:08:48,444 --> 01:08:50,537
Sleep.

775
01:09:50,873 --> 01:09:53,068
<i>Come on, little brother.</i>

776
01:09:53,142 --> 01:09:56,771
<i>It's all right.
Don't be scared.</i>

777
01:09:56,846 --> 01:09:58,780
<i>Come on.</i>

778
01:09:58,848 --> 01:10:00,941
<i>Come on.</i>

779
01:10:01,017 --> 01:10:03,417
<i>Come on.</i>

780
01:10:25,136 --> 01:10:27,969
Remember?

781
01:10:41,986 --> 01:10:44,978
<i>Go ahead. Open it.</i>

782
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:57,691
<i>Oh, that's sad.</i>

783
01:11:01,139 --> 01:11:03,505
<i>Isn't that sad, little brother?</i>

784
01:11:06,911 --> 01:11:10,005
<i>Talk to him, little brother.</i>

785
01:11:10,081 --> 01:11:12,072
Holland.

786
01:11:16,487 --> 01:11:18,785
<i>Think. Concentrate.</i>

787
01:11:18,856 --> 01:11:20,847
<i>Think hard.</i>

788
01:11:23,328 --> 01:11:25,922
<i>Play the game
the way she taught you.</i>

789
01:11:25,997 --> 01:11:29,626
<i>You're good at the game.
Go ahead and do it.</i>

790
01:11:48,453 --> 01:11:50,614
<i>He has something for you.</i>

791
01:11:51,889 --> 01:11:53,880
Holland.

792
01:11:59,597 --> 01:12:01,861
<i>Hello, little brother.</i>

793
01:12:01,933 --> 01:12:04,060
Hello.

794
01:12:04,135 --> 01:12:06,194
Are you all right?

795
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:08,238
Yes.

796
01:12:08,306 --> 01:12:10,331
And I have something for you.

797
01:12:10,408 --> 01:12:12,308
You do?

798
01:12:12,377 --> 01:12:14,811
Take it.

799
01:12:16,581 --> 01:12:18,742
<i>Take it.</i>

800
01:12:22,887 --> 01:12:25,879
- It's stuck.
- Take it.

801
01:12:27,191 --> 01:12:30,285
I can't. It won't come.

802
01:12:30,361 --> 01:12:32,921
Your finger's all swollen.

803
01:12:32,997 --> 01:12:36,057
<i>I know, I know.
Take it.</i>

804
01:12:36,134 --> 01:12:38,796
I'd better not.

805
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:40,895
Ada would get mad.

806
01:12:40,972 --> 01:12:43,031
She said to bury it.

807
01:12:43,107 --> 01:12:45,041
Ada says the ring is cursed.

808
01:12:45,109 --> 01:12:47,043
<i>"Ada says. Ada says."</i>

809
01:12:47,111 --> 01:12:49,511
Take it.

810
01:12:54,886 --> 01:12:58,185
Holland, it won't come off.

811
01:12:58,256 --> 01:13:00,190
It won't.

812
01:13:00,258 --> 01:13:02,192
<i>Hey, wait.</i>

813
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:06,458
I've got an idea.
Come closer.

814
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:11,891
<i>In the garden by the gate-</i>

815
01:13:11,969 --> 01:13:14,904
<i>You're good at the game.</i>

816
01:13:14,972 --> 01:13:18,430
<i>Go ahead and do it.
Concentrate.</i>

817
01:13:18,509 --> 01:13:20,443
No!

818
01:13:20,511 --> 01:13:22,536
<i>Yes. Do it, little brother.</i>

819
01:13:22,613 --> 01:13:25,776
<i>It's easy. Do it, Niles.</i>

820
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:29,183
<i>Come on. Do it.
Do it now.</i>

821
01:13:29,253 --> 01:13:31,278
<i>Now.</i>

822
01:14:05,556 --> 01:14:07,547
Holland.

823
01:14:09,093 --> 01:14:11,152
Holland.

824
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:14,621
Hi.

825
01:14:18,035 --> 01:14:20,970
What are you looking
so worried for, little brother?

826
01:14:21,038 --> 01:14:23,165
I thought maybe
you wouldn't come.

827
01:14:23,241 --> 01:14:26,210
<i>Of course I came.
What do you think?</i>

828
01:14:27,345 --> 01:14:29,939
Ada says we can't
play the game anymore.

829
01:14:30,014 --> 01:14:32,983
No more game? Why?

830
01:14:34,152 --> 01:14:36,143
Ada says it's wrong.

831
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:38,381
<i>"Ada says."</i>

832
01:14:38,456 --> 01:14:41,550
What's wrong with playing
the game, for cripe's sake?

833
01:14:41,626 --> 01:14:43,958
She says it's dangerous.

834
01:14:44,028 --> 01:14:45,962
<i>Dangerous.</i>

835
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:49,056
Yeah. And I'm
getting scared, Holland.

836
01:14:49,133 --> 01:14:51,067
<i>What are you scared of?</i>

837
01:14:51,135 --> 01:14:53,831
I don't know.
But Ada's right.

838
01:14:53,905 --> 01:14:55,873
Something awful
could happen.

839
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:59,740
We can still play the game.
She doesn't have to know.

840
01:14:59,811 --> 01:15:01,870
We could play it in secret.

841
01:15:01,946 --> 01:15:04,414
<i>- She'll know.
- How?</i>

842
01:15:04,482 --> 01:15:06,450
Ada knows everything.

843
01:15:06,517 --> 01:15:09,486
She can tell what you're
thinking about if she wants.

844
01:15:09,554 --> 01:15:13,581
If she finds out,
it's gonna make her unhappy.

845
01:15:13,658 --> 01:15:16,456
I don't want to
make her cry again.

846
01:15:16,527 --> 01:15:20,190
You didn't see her upstairs.
She was crying.

847
01:15:20,264 --> 01:15:22,562
<i>I'm scared for her too,
Holland.</i>

848
01:15:22,633 --> 01:15:24,567
Look, little brother.

849
01:15:24,635 --> 01:15:26,865
Getting scared isn't
gonna do any good.

850
01:15:26,938 --> 01:15:29,805
<i>Besides, if you get scared...</i>

851
01:15:29,874 --> 01:15:32,604
<i>you're not gonna be able
to play the game at all.</i>

852
01:15:32,677 --> 01:15:35,703
And I won't be around then.

853
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:38,214
Don't say that, Holland.

854
01:15:38,282 --> 01:15:42,218
We can be together.
We can always be together.

855
01:15:42,286 --> 01:15:44,481
But don't say that.

856
01:15:44,555 --> 01:15:48,355
<i>Cripes!
Don't ever say that.</i>

857
01:15:50,995 --> 01:15:52,986
No.

858
01:15:54,165 --> 01:15:56,998
Well... sure.

859
01:15:57,068 --> 01:15:59,059
If you want me to.

860
01:16:00,504 --> 01:16:02,597
But don't say that, Holland.

861
01:16:05,743 --> 01:16:11,682
<i>I can't help it.
I'm just scared, that's all.</i>

862
01:16:11,749 --> 01:16:13,979
<i>I'm scared.</i>

863
01:16:14,051 --> 01:16:16,246
<i>I'm really scared.</i>

864
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,346
<i>Okay. I'll try,</i>

865
01:16:19,423 --> 01:16:22,324
<i>I will. Honest.</i>

866
01:16:22,393 --> 01:16:24,361
<i>But we better be careful.</i>

867
01:16:45,449 --> 01:16:47,974
<i>They're coming!
They're coming!</i>

868
01:16:51,923 --> 01:16:55,051
Ta-da! Mother of the year.

869
01:16:55,126 --> 01:16:57,959
Hi, Torrie.

870
01:16:58,029 --> 01:17:00,020
<i>Oh!</i>

871
01:17:00,097 --> 01:17:02,964
<i>Let me see the baby.</i>

872
01:17:03,034 --> 01:17:05,935
<i>Oh, isn't she beautiful?</i>

873
01:17:06,003 --> 01:17:08,733
Oh, what a lovely-
Let me hold her.

874
01:17:08,806 --> 01:17:11,536
Oh, she's my dear child.

875
01:17:11,609 --> 01:17:14,305
<i>She'll have
a lot of mothers around here.</i>

876
01:17:14,378 --> 01:17:17,973
Look at that little face.

877
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:25,184
- Look, look!
- She's smiling! Oh!

878
01:17:31,529 --> 01:17:34,123
<i>She has to eat in an hour.</i>

879
01:17:41,505 --> 01:17:43,496
Mother.

880
01:17:45,810 --> 01:17:47,869
I brought you some lunch.

881
01:17:51,615 --> 01:17:53,708
And after
you have your soup...

882
01:17:53,784 --> 01:17:55,718
I'll read to you.

883
01:17:55,786 --> 01:17:57,879
Won't that be nice?

884
01:18:01,425 --> 01:18:05,589
<i>I had to take Anthony Adverse back.
It was overdue.</i>

885
01:18:09,033 --> 01:18:11,024
I've been working
on the magic show.

886
01:18:13,437 --> 01:18:15,735
I'm trying to make it work.

887
01:18:15,806 --> 01:18:19,367
Ada says it's a puzzle,
but I'll get it.

888
01:18:24,582 --> 01:18:27,244
Oh! The baby's home.

889
01:18:27,318 --> 01:18:30,253
It's a girl, just like I said.

890
01:18:30,321 --> 01:18:33,188
And she's beautiful.

891
01:18:34,625 --> 01:18:36,593
Mother...

892
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:38,594
please don't cry.

893
01:18:38,662 --> 01:18:41,130
I don't like to see you cry.

894
01:18:43,634 --> 01:18:47,092
Everything is going to
be all right.

895
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:55,371
Once you used to
read to us.

896
01:18:55,446 --> 01:18:57,641
Now it's the other way around.

897
01:19:07,825 --> 01:19:10,020
"Once upon a time"-

898
01:19:10,094 --> 01:19:14,121
Fairy tales always seem
to begin like that, don't they?

899
01:19:16,834 --> 01:19:19,826
"Once upon a time,
there were some elves...

900
01:19:19,904 --> 01:19:22,498
"who happened upon
a cottage in a wood...

901
01:19:22,573 --> 01:19:25,133
"where they spied
a baby in a cradle.

902
01:19:25,209 --> 01:19:28,610
"The mother
was nowhere to be seen.

903
01:19:28,679 --> 01:19:32,206
<i>"And the elves,
being bad and mischievous creatures...</i>

904
01:19:32,283 --> 01:19:35,980
"who loved nothing so much
as doing harm to others...

905
01:19:36,053 --> 01:19:40,285
"stole the child
and left in his place a changeling...

906
01:19:40,357 --> 01:19:43,349
<i>"an ugly creature
of impish countenance...</i>

907
01:19:43,427 --> 01:19:46,692
<i>that no mother
could possibly love."</i>

908
01:21:27,064 --> 01:21:28,998
I'm sorry, boy.

909
01:21:32,369 --> 01:21:34,360
Leno, he's...

910
01:21:37,508 --> 01:21:39,476
It's broke.

911
01:21:39,543 --> 01:21:42,569
Leno fix.
Leno- Leno fix.

912
01:21:42,646 --> 01:21:45,843
Leno fix. It's broke.

913
01:21:48,953 --> 01:21:50,944
Leno fix.

914
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:03,359
<i>It's broke. Broke.</i>

915
01:22:12,243 --> 01:22:15,508
If the baby cries, just let her.
Don't go spoiling her now.

916
01:22:19,116 --> 01:22:22,051
We'll bring some ice cream
home after the show, Aunt Vee.

917
01:22:22,119 --> 01:22:24,417
<i>Thank you.</i>

918
01:22:24,488 --> 01:22:27,423
Yankees are playing
tonight, and I'm-

919
01:22:27,491 --> 01:22:30,688
- Winnie, you sit up front.
- Oh, thank you, Rider.

920
01:22:30,761 --> 01:22:33,889
Oh, close that door!
The wind is fierce.

921
01:22:38,269 --> 01:22:40,260
Have you seen Niles?

922
01:22:40,337 --> 01:22:42,328
- No. Isn't he in his room?
- No.

923
01:22:53,417 --> 01:22:55,408
Niles!

924
01:23:15,506 --> 01:23:17,440
<i>- Niles?</i>

925
01:23:19,543 --> 01:23:22,535
<i>Child, what are you doing down there?</i>

926
01:23:24,114 --> 01:23:26,105
<i>Playing.</i>

927
01:23:27,518 --> 01:23:30,715
Come up, please.
Bring your things.

928
01:23:46,136 --> 01:23:48,900
<i>- Niles.
- Hmm?</i>

929
01:23:51,775 --> 01:23:53,766
Were you playing the game?

930
01:23:53,844 --> 01:23:55,835
No.

931
01:24:14,732 --> 01:24:16,893
<i>Ashford One,
calling Indianapolis ground.</i>

932
01:24:16,967 --> 01:24:19,060
<i>Ashford One
calling Indianapolis ground.</i>

933
01:24:19,136 --> 01:24:21,070
<i>Come in, please.</i>

934
01:24:21,138 --> 01:24:23,072
<i>We're here,
Ashford One. Over.</i>

935
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:27,873
<i>My windscreen's iced over. Going to have to
come in blind. Can you head me?</i>

936
01:24:27,945 --> 01:24:29,879
<i>We can head you, Ashford One.</i>

937
01:24:29,947 --> 01:24:31,881
Is Mary there with you?

938
01:24:31,949 --> 01:24:34,213
Yes, I'm here, Jack.
It's me, Mary.

939
01:24:34,284 --> 01:24:36,218
<i>We're all rooting for you.</i>

940
01:24:36,286 --> 01:24:39,483
<i>That-a-girl, Mary,
Chin up. Buster's here too.</i>

941
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:41,624
And I'm gonna
put you right down...

942
01:24:41,692 --> 01:24:44,525
and you're gonna
go to sleep, yes, you are.

943
01:24:44,595 --> 01:24:47,621
Wait just a minute.
You'll soon be in your bed.

944
01:24:47,698 --> 01:24:50,599
Yes, sweetheart.
Ooh, what a pretty girl.

945
01:24:50,667 --> 01:24:53,329
Ooh. Ooh, you're so pretty.

946
01:24:53,404 --> 01:24:56,271
You're so pretty.
Yes, you are.

947
01:24:58,342 --> 01:25:00,276
What is that?

948
01:25:00,344 --> 01:25:02,312
<i>- What are you doing there?</i>

949
01:25:02,379 --> 01:25:04,677
Go away! Get away,
you crazy old man.

950
01:25:04,748 --> 01:25:07,148
<i>Get away. Get away,
you damn fool!</i>

951
01:25:07,217 --> 01:25:09,276
<i>Get away! Go on! Get out.</i>

952
01:25:17,428 --> 01:25:19,362
<i>- All right.
- What is it?</i>

953
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:23,161
It was that damned Angelini. He scared me
half to death. Right there at that window.

954
01:25:23,233 --> 01:25:25,167
<i>Oh, honey, shush.</i>

955
01:25:25,235 --> 01:25:27,226
Oh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

956
01:25:27,304 --> 01:25:30,137
You run along.
I will sit with the baby.

957
01:25:30,207 --> 01:25:32,698
Well, he scared her
half to death too.

958
01:25:32,776 --> 01:25:34,767
<i>Damned idiot.</i>

959
01:25:53,297 --> 01:25:55,424
<i>Thank you, child.</i>

960
01:26:03,874 --> 01:26:07,275
These hands told me
this weather was coming.

961
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:25,494
I will go sit
with your mother.

962
01:26:25,562 --> 01:26:27,826
- Put down the netting, please.
- Okay.

963
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:39,111
Ada! Ada!

964
01:29:39,189 --> 01:29:41,180
<i>Ada, Ada, Ada!</i>

965
01:29:46,363 --> 01:29:48,297
<i>Anything under there?</i>

966
01:29:48,365 --> 01:29:51,300
Get some light over here.

967
01:29:52,703 --> 01:29:54,728
You see what I mean?

968
01:29:54,805 --> 01:29:57,831
There's Angelini's ladder
right where he left it.

969
01:29:57,908 --> 01:30:00,775
Christ. It's the Lindbergh thing
all over again.

970
01:30:00,844 --> 01:30:03,244
<i>- Fowler. This way.
- George.</i>

971
01:30:05,115 --> 01:30:07,106
Uncle George!

972
01:30:08,118 --> 01:30:10,143
Uncle George!

973
01:30:12,522 --> 01:30:14,513
<i>You there!</i>

974
01:30:14,591 --> 01:30:17,958
<i>No!</i>

975
01:30:18,028 --> 01:30:19,962
<i>More cars comin'.</i>

976
01:30:20,030 --> 01:30:22,328
<i>Where's Charlie
with those other dogs?</i>

977
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:24,663
<i>- There's Charlie's truck now.</i>

978
01:30:26,136 --> 01:30:28,229
<i>It's about time!</i>

979
01:30:37,814 --> 01:30:39,782
<i>Has anybody
found her, Bob?</i>

980
01:30:44,354 --> 01:30:46,481
<i>Nothin' in here.</i>

981
01:30:50,093 --> 01:30:52,584
Child, have you seen Rider?

982
01:30:52,662 --> 01:30:55,426
<i>- Come on!
- Niles?</i>

983
01:30:55,499 --> 01:30:57,626
Oh, go inside, please.

984
01:30:57,701 --> 01:30:59,669
<i>Get up on there.</i>

985
01:30:59,736 --> 01:31:01,601
<i>Let me up the ladder.</i>

986
01:31:01,671 --> 01:31:04,105
Rider! Rider!

987
01:31:04,174 --> 01:31:07,143
<i>The Italian took the kid.
Could be miles away by now.</i>

988
01:31:07,210 --> 01:31:09,235
- Rider!
- Ada?

989
01:31:11,448 --> 01:31:13,541
What's the matter?
What are you doing out here?

990
01:31:13,617 --> 01:31:15,551
Where is Rider?
Torrie needs him.

991
01:31:15,619 --> 01:31:18,417
I think I saw him
down by the pond. Rider!

992
01:31:18,488 --> 01:31:20,513
Rider!

993
01:31:20,590 --> 01:31:23,286
<i>Come on up here.</i>

994
01:31:31,802 --> 01:31:33,736
<i>- Where are ya?
- Here!</i>

995
01:31:33,804 --> 01:31:36,102
<i>- Come on!</i>

996
01:31:36,173 --> 01:31:38,698
<i>Rider, Torrie is calling
for you.</i>

997
01:31:38,775 --> 01:31:41,767
The doctor is trying
to get her to sleep.

998
01:31:46,983 --> 01:31:48,678
<i>Niles!</i>

999
01:31:48,752 --> 01:31:53,155
<i>Niles!</i>

1000
01:31:59,162 --> 01:32:01,096
<i>Come on! Be careful!</i>

1001
01:32:01,164 --> 01:32:03,496
<i>Come on.
Get a move on!</i>

1002
01:32:06,803 --> 01:32:08,737
<i>Holland!</i>

1003
01:32:08,805 --> 01:32:11,365
<i>Where are you?</i>

1004
01:32:11,441 --> 01:32:15,275
<i>Holland, where is the baby?</i>

1005
01:32:15,345 --> 01:32:18,610
<i>I know you've got the baby.</i>

1006
01:32:18,682 --> 01:32:22,778
<i>Holland. Damn you!
Where are you?</i>

1007
01:32:24,588 --> 01:32:26,613
<i>- Holland!
- Niles.</i>

1008
01:32:27,858 --> 01:32:30,088
Where is the baby?

1009
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:33,618
Holland's got the baby.
He put some pain pills in your tea.

1010
01:32:33,697 --> 01:32:35,631
<i>He stole the baby.</i>

1011
01:32:35,699 --> 01:32:40,068
He's bad.
He'll never go to heaven.

1012
01:32:41,972 --> 01:32:45,533
Holland killed Russell.
He stuck the pitchfork in the hay.

1013
01:32:45,609 --> 01:32:48,874
He was mad 'cause
Russell saw the ring.

1014
01:32:48,945 --> 01:32:51,209
The ring was mine.

1015
01:32:51,281 --> 01:32:54,512
<i>Holland gave it to me.
He told me to take it.</i>

1016
01:32:54,584 --> 01:32:57,553
<i>He made me do it
with the rose shears.</i>

1017
01:32:57,621 --> 01:32:59,714
<i>Poor Mother.</i>

1018
01:32:59,789 --> 01:33:04,317
But she found it.
Holland pushed her down the stairs.

1019
01:33:04,394 --> 01:33:06,692
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1020
01:33:06,763 --> 01:33:08,924
Oh, God, Niles!

1021
01:33:08,999 --> 01:33:11,968
Holland wanted the ring.
He always did.

1022
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:16,706
He killed Father.
He pushed the door down on him.

1023
01:33:17,741 --> 01:33:19,732
Holland!

1024
01:33:19,809 --> 01:33:22,334
Holland!
Where is the baby?

1025
01:33:22,412 --> 01:33:24,710
<i>- Please, Holland!</i>

1026
01:33:24,781 --> 01:33:27,045
Niles, listen to me.

1027
01:33:27,117 --> 01:33:29,176
Say it now.
Holland is dead!

1028
01:33:29,252 --> 01:33:31,812
- Holland did not take the baby!
- No! No!

1029
01:33:31,888 --> 01:33:34,152
- Niles did it!
- No! No!

1030
01:33:34,224 --> 01:33:36,192
No, no, no!

1031
01:33:42,599 --> 01:33:45,363
<i>Put that
son of a bitch on the truck!</i>

1032
01:33:45,435 --> 01:33:48,063
All right, now.
Goddamn it, talk!

1033
01:33:48,138 --> 01:33:51,266
<i>- Where's the baby?
- We're gonna ask you one more time.</i>

1034
01:33:51,675 --> 01:33:53,336
We got Angelini
over here at the barn!

1035
01:34:03,186 --> 01:34:05,552
Oh, my God.

1036
01:34:05,622 --> 01:34:07,556
- My God.
- George, what is it?

1037
01:34:07,624 --> 01:34:10,149
What is it? What's happ-
George, what is it?

1038
01:34:10,226 --> 01:34:12,353
<i>Oh, my God! No!</i>

1039
01:34:16,599 --> 01:34:18,533
<i>That poor little baby.</i>

1040
01:34:18,601 --> 01:34:20,535
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

1041
01:34:20,603 --> 01:34:22,537
<i>That little baby.</i>

1042
01:34:22,605 --> 01:34:25,904
<i>No, no, no, no!</i>

1043
01:34:28,578 --> 01:34:30,842
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

1044
01:34:30,914 --> 01:34:33,212
<i>Oh, no!</i>

1045
01:34:35,952 --> 01:34:38,648
You're gonna
get the chair, you bastard!

1046
01:34:38,722 --> 01:34:40,815
The chair's too good for him!

1047
01:34:42,659 --> 01:34:44,718
<i>Holland!</i>

1048
01:34:47,063 --> 01:34:49,054
<i>Holland.</i>

1049
01:34:52,035 --> 01:34:54,265
Damn you, answer me.

1050
01:34:55,271 --> 01:34:58,069
<i>Holland, please!</i>

1051
01:34:58,141 --> 01:35:00,200
<i>Who are you?</i>

1052
01:35:01,544 --> 01:35:05,002
<i>Me? I'm me.</i>

1053
01:35:05,081 --> 01:35:07,242
Niles Perry.

1054
01:35:08,818 --> 01:35:12,117
<i>Are you?
Are you sure?</i>

1055
01:35:39,616 --> 01:35:42,244
Somebody's up there.

1056
01:35:42,318 --> 01:35:44,445
<i>Who is it?</i>

1057
01:35:44,521 --> 01:35:49,390
I know. I know.
I know who it is.

1058
01:35:49,459 --> 01:35:52,656
It must be.

1059
01:35:52,729 --> 01:35:55,061
It must be.

1060
01:36:58,294 --> 01:37:00,387
<i>No! No!</i>

1061
01:38:56,646 --> 01:38:59,046
<i>Niles, wash up now.</i>

1062
01:38:59,115 --> 01:39:01,106
<i>Time for lunch.</i>
