3
00:05:35,872 --> 00:05:38,407
IT'S AN IMPRESSIVE COLLECTION.

4
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,942
YOU HAVE SOME VERY
RARE EDITIONS HERE.

5
00:05:41,077 --> 00:05:43,512
ARE YOU SURE YOU
WANT TO SELL THEM ALL?

6
00:05:43,646 --> 00:05:45,547
THEY'RE NO USE TO FATHER,
NOT ANYMORE...

7
00:05:45,682 --> 00:05:48,216
NOT SINCE HE'S
BEEN THIS WAY.

8
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:50,218
HIS LIBRARY WAS
HIS WHOLE WORLD.

9
00:05:50,353 --> 00:05:52,153
NOW IT'S JUST
A PAINFUL MEMORY.

10
00:05:52,288 --> 00:05:53,522
UNBEARABLY PAINFUL.

11
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:56,558
I UNDERSTAND.

12
00:05:58,928 --> 00:06:04,666
WELL, AT A ROUGH
PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE...

13
00:06:04,801 --> 00:06:07,703
YOU HAVE A COLLECTION HERE...
WORTH AROUND $600,000.

14
00:06:07,837 --> 00:06:09,971
600,000...

15
00:06:10,106 --> 00:06:11,774
YES, OR THEREABOUTS.

16
00:06:11,908 --> 00:06:14,042
I'VE PICKED OUT
ONE OR TWO VOLUMES

17
00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:16,712
THAT MERIT SPECIAL ATTENTION.

18
00:06:16,846 --> 00:06:18,980
THIS "PERSILES",
FOR EXAMPLE,

19
00:06:19,115 --> 00:06:21,683
IS IMPORTANT.
I'D HANG ON TO THAT.

20
00:06:21,818 --> 00:06:23,351
IT WILL NEVER DEPRECIATE.
IT'S A GOOD INVESTMENT.

21
00:06:23,386 --> 00:06:24,686
VALUABLE?

22
00:06:24,821 --> 00:06:26,855
VERY VALUABLE.

23
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:29,958
AS FOR THIS
"HYPERMORACHIA DI POLIPHILO"

24
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:32,294
BY COLONNA, VENICE 1545...

25
00:06:34,864 --> 00:06:37,433
I'M SURE I COULD
FIND YOU A BUYER.

26
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,902
BUT I WOULDN'T LET THE REST GO
FOR LESS THAN $500,000.

27
00:06:40,036 --> 00:06:41,403
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

28
00:06:43,907 --> 00:06:45,774
IT MAY TAKE A MONTH
OR SO TO PLACE THEM.

29
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,342
SO IN THE MEAN-TIME...
I ADVISE YOU TO BE PATIENT.

30
00:06:47,477 --> 00:06:48,276
A MONTH?

31
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:50,011
YES, A MONTH OR TWO.

32
00:06:50,146 --> 00:06:51,747
IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH
OF A HURRY YOU'RE IN.

33
00:06:51,881 --> 00:06:52,948
YOU SEE, MORE HURRY,
LESS MONEY.

34
00:06:53,082 --> 00:06:55,617
OF COURSE.

35
00:06:55,752 --> 00:06:57,653
WELL, THAT'S MY
ADVICE, ANYWAY.

36
00:06:57,787 --> 00:07:00,121
I'M SURE YOU WOULDN'T
WANT TO RUSH THINGS.

37
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:02,858
BUT PLEASE FEEL FREE
TO CONSULT ANOTHER EXPERT...

38
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:05,627
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
YOU KNOW WHERE TO REACH ME.

39
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:08,396
INCIDENTALLY, THIS FOUR-VOLUME
OF DON QUIXOTE...

40
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:12,668
IS QUITE NICE BUT NOT
PARTICULARLY VALUABLE.

41
00:07:12,802 --> 00:07:15,136
NOW, I COULD...

42
00:07:15,271 --> 00:07:16,872
TAKE IT OFF YOUR HANDS...
RIGHT AWAY.

43
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:23,211
MMM...

44
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:24,646
HOW MUCH WERE
YOU THINKING OF?

45
00:07:24,781 --> 00:07:26,682
OH...

46
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:29,351
I COULDN'T GO MORE THAN
$4,000, $4,200 TOPS.

47
00:07:30,787 --> 00:07:31,386
FINE.

48
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:41,797
- YOU HERE?
- HELLO, WITKIN.

49
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:43,532
YOU DIDN'T
WASTE MUCH TIME.

50
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,066
LISTEN, THERE'S A SMALL
FORTUNE IN THERE...

51
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:46,434
HELP YOURSELF.

52
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:47,970
YOU'RE A VULTURE, CORSO...
A VULTURE.

53
00:07:48,104 --> 00:07:49,337
WHO ISN'T,
IN OUR BUSINESS?

54
00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:50,772
YOU'D STOOP
TO ANYTHING.

55
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:53,141
FOR "QUIXOTE" BY YBARRA?
YOU BET I WOULD.

56
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:56,011
UNSCRUPULOUS,
THOROUGHLY UNSCRUPULOUS!

57
00:07:56,145 --> 00:07:56,979
HAPPY HUNTING.

58
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:19,735
I JUST GOT OFF THE
PHONE WITH WITKIN.

59
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:22,004
HE'S SPITTING BLOOD.

60
00:08:22,138 --> 00:08:23,872
REALLY?
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

61
00:08:27,176 --> 00:08:29,444
HE SAID YOU'RE A DOUBLE-DEALING,
MONEY-GRUBBING BASTARD.

62
00:08:31,247 --> 00:08:33,314
HE THOUGHT HE HAD
THAT DEAL SEWED UP.

63
00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:36,217
HE SAID YOU
QUEERED HIS PITCH.

64
00:08:36,352 --> 00:08:38,020
<i>WELL, HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
QUICKER OFF THE MARK.</i>

65
00:08:38,154 --> 00:08:40,789
- MAY I?
- SURE.

66
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:44,159
AND HE SAID YOUR EVALUATION
WAS WAY OVER THE TOP...

67
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:47,362
GOT THOSE PEOPLE
COMING OUT IN A RASH.

68
00:08:47,496 --> 00:08:49,565
NOW THEY'RE ASKING TWICE
WHAT THOSE BOOKS ARE WORTH.

69
00:08:56,138 --> 00:08:57,706
LET'S FACE IT,
YOU SCREWED HIM.

70
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,441
THAT'S WHAT
IT'S CALLED.

71
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:01,443
THAT'S WHAT
IT'S CALLED, YES.

72
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:02,343
HE ALSO SAID THAT YOU
SNATCHED THE "DON QUI...

73
00:09:10,787 --> 00:09:14,489
YBARRA "DON QUIXOTE", 1780...

74
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:17,392
ALL FOUR VOLUMES.

75
00:09:17,526 --> 00:09:19,327
SON-OF-A-BITCH.

76
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:21,362
FANTASTIC.

77
00:09:21,497 --> 00:09:22,097
YOU ARE THE BEST.

78
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,167
THAT CLIENT OF YOURS,
THE SWISS...

79
00:09:26,302 --> 00:09:27,769
DO YOU THINK HE'D STILL BE
INTERESTED IN THIS EDITION?

80
00:09:27,904 --> 00:09:29,370
I'D HAVE WITKIN
ON MY ASS.

81
00:09:29,505 --> 00:09:30,806
I TOLD HIM I HAD
NO PART OF THIS.

82
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,609
EXCEPT 10 PERCENT.

83
00:09:33,743 --> 00:09:36,044
20 PERCENT.
THE SWISS WAS MY CLIENT.

84
00:09:36,178 --> 00:09:38,379
NO DEAL.

85
00:09:38,514 --> 00:09:39,881
<i>15.
FOR MY CHILDREN'S SAKE.</i>

86
00:09:40,016 --> 00:09:41,516
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY CHILDREN.

87
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:42,718
I'M STILL YOUNG.
GIVE ME TIME.

88
00:09:42,852 --> 00:09:44,319
10.

89
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,104
HEY, MAN, HOW YA DOIN'?
HOW ABOUT A COUPLE OF BUCKS?

90
00:10:02,238 --> 00:10:03,538
NOT TODAY!

91
00:10:16,436 --> 00:10:17,803
...IN THE PRESENT CONTEXT,
HOWEVER...

92
00:10:26,913 --> 00:10:28,580
...AND EARLIER, IN 1580,

93
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:30,616
IN "De la Demonamanie
des Sorciers"

94
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,718
BY THE FRENCHMAN,
JEAN BODIN.

95
00:10:32,852 --> 00:10:36,187
BODIN WAS PROBABLY
THE FIRST...

96
00:10:36,322 --> 00:10:38,990
TO ATTEMPT TO
ESTABLISH A SYSTEM

97
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,126
IF THE TERM "SYSTEM" MAY BE
APPLIED TO THE MIDDLE AGES...

98
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,594
FOR CLASSIFYING...

99
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:44,996
THE CONTEMPORARY
PERCEPTIONS OF EVIL.

100
00:10:45,131 --> 00:10:46,998
IN BODIN, WE FIND ONE OF
THE FIRST DEFINITIONS

101
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:49,601
OF THE WORD "WITCH".

102
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:53,672
AND I QUOTE,
"A WITCH IS A PERSON...

103
00:10:53,807 --> 00:10:56,475
WHO, THOUGH COGNIZANT OF
THE LAWS OF GOD...

104
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:58,710
ENDEAVORS TO ACT
THROUGH THE MEDIUM

105
00:10:58,845 --> 00:11:01,146
OF A PACT WITH THE DEVIL."

106
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,750
TO ASSIST THEM IN THEIR WORK,
MANY WITCHES KEPT FAMILIARS...

107
00:11:04,884 --> 00:11:07,886
THAT IS TO SAY,
CREATURES SUCH AS CATS OR TOADS,

108
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,322
IN WHICH SUPERNATURAL
SPIRITS OR DEMONS...

109
00:11:10,457 --> 00:11:12,491
WERE THOUGHT TO RESIDE.

110
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,526
FOR THOSE OF YOU,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...

111
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:16,462
WHO WISH TO DELVE
MORE DEEPLY

112
00:11:16,596 --> 00:11:18,797
INTO THE CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT
OF WITCHCRAFT...

113
00:11:18,932 --> 00:11:20,866
A GREAT DEAL OF RELEVANT
INFORMATION

114
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,101
MAY BE FOUND IN

115
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:26,672
NICOLAS REMES'
"DEMONOLATRIA LIBRE";

116
00:11:26,806 --> 00:11:28,907
AND "COMPENDUIM MALEFICAM"
BY FRANCESCO MARIA GUAZO.

117
00:11:39,218 --> 00:11:43,121
I SEE YOU WERE STIMULATED BY
MY LITTLE TALK, MR. CORSO.

118
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:48,259
DID I SNORE?

119
00:11:48,394 --> 00:11:50,662
IT'S NICE
OF YOU TO ASK.

120
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:52,564
NO, NOT THAT I NOTICED.

121
00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:53,431
SHALL WE GO?

122
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:04,610
DON'T YOU
SLEEP NIGHTS?

123
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:05,878
LIKE A BABY.

124
00:12:06,012 --> 00:12:07,546
STRANGE.

125
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,649
I'D HAVE BET A BRACE
OF GUTENBERG BIBLES...

126
00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:13,018
YOU SPEND HALF THE NIGHT
WITH YOUR EYES PEELED.

127
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:15,954
YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE LEAN,
HUNGRY RESTLESS TYPES...

128
00:12:16,088 --> 00:12:18,657
THAT PUT THE WIND UP
JULIUS CAESAR...

129
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,425
MEN WHO STAB THEIR
FRIENDS IN THE BACK.

130
00:12:24,998 --> 00:12:27,098
NOT, I SUSPECT, THAT
YOU HAVE MANY FRIENDS,

131
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:28,433
DO YOU, MR. CORSO?

132
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:30,435
YOUR KIND SELDOM DOES.

133
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,637
THAT MAKES
TWO OF US.

134
00:12:38,745 --> 00:12:40,278
YOU'RE RIGHT,
OF COURSE.

135
00:12:40,413 --> 00:12:43,015
YOUR FRIENDSHIPS DON'T
CONCERN ME IN THE LEAST.

136
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:45,483
OUR RELATIONS HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN STRICTLY COMMERCIAL...

137
00:12:45,618 --> 00:12:47,786
AND THAT'S
THE WAY I LIKE IT.

138
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:50,956
THE PROFESSIONAL AND THE PERSONAL
SHOULD BE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.

139
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,958
LISTEN, I CAME HERE
TO DO SOME BUSINESS...

140
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:54,826
NOT SHOOT THE BREEZE.

141
00:12:54,961 --> 00:12:56,962
IF YOU WANT TO EXPOUND YOUR
PERSONAL PHILOSOPHIES...

142
00:12:57,096 --> 00:12:58,329
WRITE ANOTHER BOOK.

143
00:12:58,464 --> 00:12:59,364
YOU DON'T LIKE ME,
DO YOU?

144
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:00,832
I DON'T HAVE TO.

145
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:01,767
YOU'RE A CLIENT
AND YOU PAY WELL.

146
00:13:18,618 --> 00:13:20,351
<i>YOU'RE PRIVILEGED,
MR. CORSO.</i>

147
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:22,955
VERY FEW PEOPLE EVER
SET FOOT IN HERE.

148
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:24,422
<i>THIS IS MY
PRIVATE COLLECTION.</i>

149
00:13:26,993 --> 00:13:29,260
<i>SOME BIBLIOPHILES SPECIALIZE
IN GOTHIC NOVELS...</i>

150
00:13:29,395 --> 00:13:31,129
<i>OTHERS IN
BOOKS OF HOURS.</i>

151
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,733
ALL MY OWN RARE EDITIONS
HAVE THE SAME PROTAGONIST...

152
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:36,568
THE DEVIL.

153
00:13:36,703 --> 00:13:37,769
MAY I TAKE A LOOK?

154
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:39,537
YES.

155
00:13:39,672 --> 00:13:40,572
THAT'S WHY I
BROUGHT YOU HERE.

156
00:13:56,222 --> 00:13:57,990
BEAUTIFUL,
AREN'T THEY?

157
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:03,428
THE SOFT SHEEN,
THE SUPERB GILDING...

158
00:14:03,562 --> 00:14:07,232
NOT TO MENTION THE CENTURIES
OF WISDOM THEY CONTAIN.

159
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:10,268
I KNOW PEOPLE WHO WOULD KILL
FOR A COLLECTION LIKE THIS.

160
00:14:10,402 --> 00:14:12,104
THE "ARS DIAVILI".

161
00:14:12,238 --> 00:14:14,940
YOU'LL NEVER SEE AS MANY
BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT

162
00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:16,708
ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD.

163
00:14:16,843 --> 00:14:18,510
THEY'RE THE RAREST...

164
00:14:18,645 --> 00:14:21,146
THE CHOICEST EDITIONS
IN EXISTENCE.

165
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,282
IT'S TAKEN ME A LIFETIME
TO ASSEMBLE THEM.

166
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,551
ONLY THE SUPREME
MASTERPIECE WAS MISSING.

167
00:14:26,686 --> 00:14:27,653
COME...

168
00:14:35,828 --> 00:14:37,796
THE "NINE GATES OF
THE KINGDOM OF SHADOWS".

169
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,164
YOU'RE FAMILIAR
WITH IT?

170
00:14:39,298 --> 00:14:43,702
YES. VENICE, 1666.

171
00:14:43,836 --> 00:14:45,804
THE AUTHOR AND PRINTER,
ARISTIDE TORCHIA...

172
00:14:45,938 --> 00:14:47,639
WAS BURNED BY
THE HOLY INQUISITION...

173
00:14:47,774 --> 00:14:49,407
TOGETHER WITH
ALL HIS WORKS.

174
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:51,242
ONLY THREE COPIES
SURVIVED.

175
00:14:51,377 --> 00:14:52,644
ONE.

176
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:54,479
THE CATALOG LISTS

177
00:14:54,613 --> 00:14:56,381
THREE COPIES SURVIVING
IN PRIVATE OWNERSHIP...

178
00:14:56,515 --> 00:14:58,249
THE FARGAS, THE KESSLER
AND THE TELFER.

179
00:14:58,384 --> 00:15:00,052
IT'S TRUE. YOU KNOW
YOUR BUSINESS...

180
00:15:00,186 --> 00:15:02,154
BUT YOU'RE MISTAKEN
NONETHELESS.

181
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:05,356
ACCORDING TO MY OWN RESEARCH,
ONLY ONE IS AUTHENTIC.

182
00:15:05,491 --> 00:15:07,425
WELL, THREE ARE KNOWN.

183
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,828
THAT'S THE TROUBLE.

184
00:15:09,962 --> 00:15:11,797
WHERE'D YOU GET IT?

185
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:13,031
I BOUGHT IT
FROM TELFER.

186
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,000
TELFER?

187
00:15:15,134 --> 00:15:17,002
YES, HE FINALLY
SOLD IT TO ME...

188
00:15:17,136 --> 00:15:18,670
THE DAY BEFORE
HE KILLED HIMSELF.

189
00:15:18,805 --> 00:15:20,939
IT WAS GOOD TIMING.

190
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,217
"SILENTIUM EST AUREUM."

191
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,352
SILENCE IS GOLDEN.

192
00:15:34,486 --> 00:15:36,688
PRECISELY.

193
00:15:36,823 --> 00:15:39,324
EVER HEARD OF THE
"DELOMELANICON"?

194
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,994
I'VE HEARD OF IT, YES.
IT'S A MYTH, ISN'T IT?

195
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:45,163
A BOOK REPUTED TO HAVE BEEN
WRITTEN BY SATAN HIMSELF.

196
00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:48,333
NO MYTH.
THAT BOOK EXISTED.

197
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:49,801
TORCHIA ACTUALLY
ACQUIRED IT.

198
00:15:53,706 --> 00:15:56,074
THE ENGRAVINGS
YOU'RE NOW ADMIRING

199
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:58,944
WERE ADAPTED BY TORCHIA
FROM THE "DELOMELANICON".

200
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:02,848
THEY FORM A KIND OF
SATANIC RIDDLE.

201
00:16:02,982 --> 00:16:06,284
CORRECTLY INTERPRETED WITH
THE AID OF THE ORIGINAL TEXT...

202
00:16:06,418 --> 00:16:08,519
AND SUFFICIENT
INSIDE INFORMATION...

203
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:10,255
THEY'RE REPUTED
TO CONJURE UP

204
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:11,957
THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS
IN PERSON.

205
00:16:12,091 --> 00:16:15,326
YOU DON'T SAY.

206
00:16:15,461 --> 00:16:18,096
ARE YOU A RELIGIOUS MAN,
MR. CORSO?

207
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:20,832
I MEAN, DO YOU BELIEVE
IN THE SUPERNATURAL?

208
00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:22,267
I BELIEVE IN
MY PERCENTAGE.

209
00:16:25,204 --> 00:16:27,205
DON'T YOU GET DIZZY,
STANDING THERE?

210
00:16:30,643 --> 00:16:32,343
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU
WANT FROM ME, BALKAN?

211
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:42,053
I WANT YOU TO GO TO EUROPE
AND INVESTIGATE.

212
00:16:42,188 --> 00:16:44,622
THE OTHER TWO COPIES ARE
IN PORTUGAL AND FRANCE.

213
00:16:44,757 --> 00:16:46,457
I WANT YOU TO FIND...

214
00:16:46,592 --> 00:16:48,794
SOME WAY OF COMPARING
THEM WITH MINE...

215
00:16:48,928 --> 00:16:50,896
EVERY PAGE, EVERY ENGRAVING,
THE BINDING, EVERYTHING.

216
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,563
I'M CONVINCED...

217
00:16:52,698 --> 00:16:54,532
ONLY ONE IS AUTHENTIC...
I WANT TO KNOW WHICH.

218
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:56,367
THAT COULD BE
AN EXPENSIVE TRIP.

219
00:16:56,502 --> 00:17:01,139
THAT'S TO GET YOU STARTED.
SPEND WHAT YOU NEED.

220
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:05,510
WHAT IF I FIND THAT
YOUR COPY'S A FORGERY?

221
00:17:05,644 --> 00:17:06,812
IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE.

222
00:17:06,946 --> 00:17:08,379
REALLY?

223
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:12,150
IT DOESN'T
APPEAR TO BE.

224
00:17:15,487 --> 00:17:17,289
EVEN THE PAPER
SOUNDS KOSHER.

225
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:20,225
EVEN SO.
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.

226
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,559
YOU MEAN THE DEVIL
WON'T SHOW UP?

227
00:17:23,629 --> 00:17:26,497
IF ALL THREE COPIES TURN OUT
TO BE BOGUS OR INCOMPLETE...

228
00:17:26,632 --> 00:17:29,034
YOUR WORK WILL BE DONE.
IF, ON THE OTHER HAND...

229
00:17:29,168 --> 00:17:30,936
ONE OF THEM TURNS OUT
TO BE GENUINE...

230
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,138
I'LL FINANCE YOU FURTHER.

231
00:17:33,272 --> 00:17:38,443
I WANT YOU TO GET IT FOR ME,
AT ALL COSTS, NEVER MIND HOW.

232
00:17:38,577 --> 00:17:41,579
"NEVER MIND HOW",
SOUNDS ILLEGAL.

233
00:17:41,714 --> 00:17:43,048
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME
YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING ILLEGAL.

234
00:17:43,182 --> 00:17:44,782
NOT THAT ILLEGAL.

235
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:45,851
HENCE THE SIZE
OF THE CHECK.

236
00:17:51,557 --> 00:17:52,958
DO A GOOD JOB,
I'LL DOUBLE IT.

237
00:17:56,863 --> 00:17:58,763
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT

238
00:17:58,898 --> 00:18:00,665
IF YOU'RE LETTING IT
OUT OF YOUR HANDS.

239
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,834
I HAVE THE UTMOST
FAITH IN YOU, MR. CORSO.

240
00:18:02,969 --> 00:18:04,635
THERE'S NOTHING
MORE RELIABLE

241
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,304
THAN A MAN WHOSE LOYALTY
CAN BE BOUGHT FOR HARD CASH.

242
00:19:06,432 --> 00:19:09,901
GOOD MORNING,
I'M DEAN CORSO.

243
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:12,938
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY TO DISTURB
YOU AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

244
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:26,151
IT WOULD BE VERY
HELPFUL, MA'AM...

245
00:19:26,285 --> 00:19:28,586
IF YOU COULD TELL
ME WHAT YOU KNOW...

246
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,155
ABOUT THIS BOOK.

247
00:19:38,197 --> 00:19:40,031
ISN'T THIS ONE OF
MY HUSBAND'S BOOKS?

248
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,067
RIGHT.

249
00:19:42,201 --> 00:19:43,969
IT WAS IN HIS COLLECTION
UNTIL VERY RECENTLY.

250
00:19:44,103 --> 00:19:45,536
HE SOLD IT TO
A CLIENT OF MINE.

251
00:19:45,671 --> 00:19:47,605
I'M TRYING
TO AUTHENTICATE IT.

252
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:50,041
HE SOLD IT, YOU SAY?

253
00:19:50,176 --> 00:19:53,144
HOW STRANGE, THIS WAS ONE OF
HIS MOST TREASURED POSSESSIONS.

254
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,946
HE NEVER MENTIONED
THE SALE?

255
00:19:55,081 --> 00:19:57,015
<i>NO. IT'S NEWS TO ME.</i>

256
00:19:57,149 --> 00:19:58,249
WHO BOUGHT IT?

257
00:19:58,384 --> 00:19:59,985
A PRIVATE COLLECTOR.

258
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:02,354
MAY I KNOW HIS NAME?

259
00:20:02,488 --> 00:20:04,889
I'M AFRAID
THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL.

260
00:20:05,024 --> 00:20:07,125
I SUPPOSE HE HAS
A BILL OF SALE?

261
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:09,227
NO PROBLEM THERE.

262
00:20:09,362 --> 00:20:11,863
IS THIS YOUR JOB...
AUTHENTICATING RARE BOOKS?

263
00:20:11,998 --> 00:20:13,798
AND TRACKING
THEM DOWN, YES.

264
00:20:13,932 --> 00:20:15,733
YOU'RE A BOOK DETECTIVE.

265
00:20:15,868 --> 00:20:17,068
KIND OF.

266
00:20:17,203 --> 00:20:19,537
DO YOU RECALL
WHEN AND WHERE

267
00:20:19,671 --> 00:20:21,539
YOUR HUSBAND
ACQUIRED THIS BOOK?

268
00:20:23,642 --> 00:20:25,977
IN SPAIN.

269
00:20:26,112 --> 00:20:28,646
WE WERE VACATIONING
AT TOLEDO.

270
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,016
ANDREW GOT VERY EXCITED.

271
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,917
HE PAID A GREAT DEAL
OF MONEY FOR IT.

272
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:36,421
HE WAS A FANATICAL
COLLECTOR.

273
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:37,422
SO I GATHER.

274
00:20:37,556 --> 00:20:39,590
I'LL SHOW YOU.

275
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,048
IMPRESSIVE.

276
00:21:04,183 --> 00:21:06,751
ANDREW USED TO SPEND
MANY HOURS IN HERE...

277
00:21:08,254 --> 00:21:09,554
TOO MANY.

278
00:21:09,689 --> 00:21:11,489
DID HE EVER TRY IT OUT?

279
00:21:11,624 --> 00:21:13,891
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

280
00:21:14,026 --> 00:21:16,060
THE BOOK?

281
00:21:16,195 --> 00:21:19,364
DID HE EVER USE IT TO
PERFORM SOME KIND OF RITUAL

282
00:21:19,498 --> 00:21:21,233
INTENDED TO PRODUCE
A SUPERNATURAL EFFECT?

283
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:22,834
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

284
00:21:22,968 --> 00:21:25,337
YES, ABSOLUTELY.

285
00:21:25,471 --> 00:21:28,273
ANDREW WAS A TRIFLE
ECCENTRIC, MR. CORSO...

286
00:21:28,407 --> 00:21:31,142
BUT HE WASN'T INSANE.

287
00:21:31,277 --> 00:21:32,577
IT'S TRUE HE'D
BEEN ACTING...

288
00:21:34,847 --> 00:21:37,048
STRANGELY THOSE
LAST FEW DAYS.

289
00:21:37,182 --> 00:21:39,317
HE SHUT HIMSELF IN HERE.

290
00:21:39,452 --> 00:21:42,320
HE SELDOM EMERGED
EXCEPT FOR MEALS.

291
00:21:42,455 --> 00:21:44,289
THAT MORNING,
I WAS AWOKEN...

292
00:21:44,423 --> 00:21:46,190
BY THE SCREAMS
OF THE MAID.

293
00:21:51,264 --> 00:21:52,230
HE'D HANGED HIMSELF.

294
00:21:55,735 --> 00:21:58,102
WHATEVER HE WAS UP TO...

295
00:21:58,237 --> 00:22:00,739
I CERTAINLY CAN'T SEE HIM
CHANTING MUMBO-JUMBO

296
00:22:00,873 --> 00:22:02,374
OR TRYING TO
RAISE THE DEAD.

297
00:22:02,508 --> 00:22:05,176
THE DEVIL, MRS. TELFER...

298
00:22:05,311 --> 00:22:06,878
THIS BOOK IS DESIGNED
TO RAISE THE DEVIL.

299
00:22:59,064 --> 00:23:01,599
"SIC LUCEAT LUX..."

300
00:23:04,737 --> 00:23:06,170
"THUS, LET THE LIGHT SHINE."

301
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,184
SON-OF-A-BITCH...
WHERE'D YOU GET THIS?

302
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:11,122
BALKAN. HE WANTS
ME TO RESEARCH IT.

303
00:26:11,256 --> 00:26:14,225
BALKAN OWNS
A "NINE GATES"?

304
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:16,528
RECENTLY ACQUIRED FROM THE
LATE LAMENTED ANDREW TELFER.

305
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:17,695
TRUST BALKAN.

306
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,597
WHAT DOES HE NEED
YOU FOR?

307
00:26:19,732 --> 00:26:22,366
I DON'T SUPPOSE
HE PLANS TO SELL IT?

308
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:25,036
HE WANTS ME TO COMPARE IT WITH
THE OTHER TWO SURVIVING COPIES,

309
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:27,005
WHICH ARE IN PORTUGAL
AND FRANCE.

310
00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:28,907
SO I'M OFF TO EUROPE.

311
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:30,775
COMPARE IT?

312
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:34,979
YEAH. ONLY ONE OF THE THREE
IS AUTHENTIC, HE SAYS.

313
00:26:35,113 --> 00:26:37,481
THIS LOOKS
GENUINE ENOUGH.

314
00:26:37,616 --> 00:26:40,151
CHRIST, IT'S GOT TO
BE WORTH A MILLION.

315
00:26:40,285 --> 00:26:42,286
TAKE CARE OF IT.

316
00:26:42,421 --> 00:26:45,356
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
I NEED YOU TO STASH IT FOR ME.

317
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,191
BECAUSE I'M STARTING
TO SEE THINGS.

318
00:26:47,325 --> 00:26:49,393
LIKE WHAT?

319
00:26:49,528 --> 00:26:51,796
UNINVITED VISITORS,
UNFAMILIAR FACES.

320
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:54,866
I DON'T TRUST ANYONE,
NOT EVEN BALKAN.

321
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,935
COME TO THINK OF IT,
I'M NOT EVEN SURE I TRUST YOU.

322
00:26:57,069 --> 00:26:58,803
YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T
SCREW YOU

323
00:26:58,938 --> 00:27:00,605
UNLESS THERE WAS
A GOOD REASON...

324
00:27:00,739 --> 00:27:02,206
MONEY, WOMEN, BUSINESS.

325
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,742
OTHER THAN THAT,
YOU CAN RELAX.

326
00:27:04,877 --> 00:27:06,678
I'LL PICK IT UP ON
MY WAY TO THE AIRPORT.

327
00:27:06,812 --> 00:27:07,378
SURE.

328
00:27:08,981 --> 00:27:11,382
THESE ENGRAVINGS
ARE TERRIFIC.

329
00:27:11,516 --> 00:27:14,052
OR HORRIFIC,
WHICHEVER.

330
00:27:14,186 --> 00:27:16,220
SENSATIONAL...

331
00:27:16,354 --> 00:27:17,655
ABSOLUTELY SENSATIONAL.

332
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:02,667
MAY I COME IN?

333
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:14,078
PLEASE SIT DOWN.

334
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,717
I'VE COME TO
TALK BUSINESS.

335
00:28:19,852 --> 00:28:20,752
MM-HMM.

336
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,888
YESTERDAY,
WHEN YOU CAME

337
00:28:24,023 --> 00:28:25,056
TO SEE ME ABOUT
THAT BOOK...

338
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,695
I WAS TOO SURPRISED TO REACT
AS I SHOULD HAVE DONE.

339
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:32,530
I MEAN, IT REALLY WAS
ONE OF ANDREW'S FAVORITES.

340
00:28:32,665 --> 00:28:34,666
SO YOU SAID.

341
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,233
I'D LIKE TO
GET IT BACK.

342
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,471
THAT COULD BE
A PROBLEM.

343
00:28:40,605 --> 00:28:42,206
NOT NECESSARILY.
IT ALL DEPENDS.

344
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,309
- ON WHAT?
- YOU.

345
00:28:45,443 --> 00:28:47,078
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THE BOOK'S
NOT MINE TO DISPOSE OF.

346
00:28:57,389 --> 00:28:59,691
YOU WORK FOR MONEY,
I TAKE IT?

347
00:28:59,825 --> 00:29:01,659
- WHAT ELSE?
- I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY.

348
00:29:01,794 --> 00:29:03,127
I'M VERY HAPPY
FOR YOU.

349
00:29:03,261 --> 00:29:04,996
YOU COULD
STAGE A THEFT.

350
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,865
I IMAGINE YOUR CLIENT
IS WELL INSURED.

351
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,802
- I'M A PROFESSIONAL, MA'AM.
- A PROFESSIONAL MERCENARY.

352
00:29:10,936 --> 00:29:12,203
MERCENARIES WORK FOR
THE HIGHEST BIDDER.

353
00:29:12,337 --> 00:29:13,571
I MAKE A LIVING.

354
00:29:13,706 --> 00:29:16,174
I COULD
THROW IN A BONUS.

355
00:29:16,308 --> 00:29:19,877
THIS HAS HAPPENED
BEFORE SOMEPLACE.

356
00:29:20,012 --> 00:29:21,746
I KNOW.
IN THE MOVIES.

357
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,580
SHE HAD AN AUTOMATIC
IN HER STOCKING.

358
00:29:27,318 --> 00:29:28,619
NO AUTOMATIC.

359
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,664
WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK?

360
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:40,831
WHY NOT?

361
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:15,192
OKAY, WHERE IS IT?

362
00:31:15,326 --> 00:31:17,161
WHERE'S WHAT?

363
00:31:17,295 --> 00:31:19,296
DON'T FUCK
WITH ME!

364
00:31:21,566 --> 00:31:22,900
I THOUGHT
I ALREADY DID.

365
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:28,605
WAIT! WAIT! WAIT!

366
00:31:54,933 --> 00:31:57,902
You have reached
Bernie's Rare Books.

367
00:31:58,036 --> 00:32:01,271
Please leave your message
after the beep.

368
00:32:01,406 --> 00:32:04,041
BERNIE.
YOU THERE?

369
00:32:04,176 --> 00:32:05,442
PICK UP.

370
00:32:09,314 --> 00:32:10,114
BERNIE!

371
00:32:35,073 --> 00:32:37,041
GIVE ME A MINUTE.
I WON'T BE LONG.

372
00:32:37,175 --> 00:32:38,943
YOU CAN TAKE ME
ON TO KENNEDY.

373
00:32:39,077 --> 00:32:40,010
NO PROBLEM, SIR.

374
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:08,272
BERNIE?

375
00:33:12,677 --> 00:33:13,577
BERNIE?

376
00:33:15,914 --> 00:33:17,148
OH, JESUS.

377
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:34,899
JESUS CHRIST.

378
00:33:44,342 --> 00:33:46,110
BERNIE...?

379
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:37,895
NO PROBLEM?

380
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:16,533
STOP.

381
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:18,435
STOP AT THAT
PHONE BOOTH, PULL OVER.

382
00:35:18,569 --> 00:35:19,870
NO PROBLEM, SIR.

383
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:28,678
He isn't
available at this time.

384
00:35:28,813 --> 00:35:30,614
May I know
who's calling?

385
00:35:30,748 --> 00:35:32,249
- DEAN CORSO.
- Would you like to leave a message?

386
00:35:32,384 --> 00:35:33,784
NO. I HAVE TO TALK
WITH HIM AT ONCE.

387
00:35:33,919 --> 00:35:35,252
Oh, I'm afraid
he's in transit.

388
00:35:35,387 --> 00:35:37,254
If you care
to give me your number,

389
00:35:37,389 --> 00:35:39,756
I'll have him return your
call when he checks with us.

390
00:35:39,891 --> 00:35:43,760
NO! I'M AT A PHONE BOOTH.
IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

391
00:35:43,895 --> 00:35:45,129
I HAVE TO SPEAK
WITH HIM RIGHT NOW.

392
00:35:45,263 --> 00:35:46,830
DO YOU HEAR ME?
RIGHT NOW.

393
00:35:48,866 --> 00:35:50,100
One moment.

394
00:36:07,852 --> 00:36:09,486
Are you there,
Mr. Corso?

395
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,221
- YES.
- I'll patch you through.

396
00:36:16,127 --> 00:36:18,562
Mr. Corso? What
have you got for me?

397
00:36:18,696 --> 00:36:21,265
- MORE THAN I BARGAINED FOR.
- What do you mean?

398
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:23,200
I MEAN I QUIT.

399
00:36:23,335 --> 00:36:24,668
I WANT TO RETURN THE BOOK.
WHERE ARE YOU?

400
00:36:24,802 --> 00:36:27,404
I'm disappointed
in you, Mr. Corso.

401
00:36:27,538 --> 00:36:29,974
You never let
me down before.

402
00:36:30,108 --> 00:36:33,477
WELL, THIS IS DIFFERENT.
YOU REMEMBER BERNIE ARMSTEIN?

403
00:36:33,611 --> 00:36:36,646
Armstein?
The dealer?

404
00:36:36,781 --> 00:36:39,350
I GAVE HIM YOUR BOOK TO STASH
FOR ME, AND NOW HE'S DEAD--

405
00:36:39,484 --> 00:36:40,750
MURDERED.

406
00:36:40,885 --> 00:36:42,252
Because of the book?

407
00:36:42,387 --> 00:36:45,789
WHAT ELSE?

408
00:36:45,923 --> 00:36:49,360
I never said it would be easy.
If it's a question of money...

409
00:36:49,494 --> 00:36:51,295
IT ISN'T THE MONEY.
I WANT OUT!

410
00:36:51,429 --> 00:36:53,497
This matter means a great
deal to me, Mr. Corso.

411
00:36:53,631 --> 00:36:55,532
I'm not an ungenerous man,
you know that.

412
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:57,868
Proceed as arranged,

413
00:36:58,003 --> 00:37:00,537
and you can tack another
zero onto your fee.

414
00:37:00,671 --> 00:37:02,306
<i>Final call for passengers
traveling to Paris...</i>

415
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,307
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU...
BALKAN?

416
00:37:06,277 --> 00:37:07,344
BALKAN.

417
00:37:57,562 --> 00:37:59,063
Buenas tardes.

418
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:03,800
DO YOU
SPEAK ENGLISH?

419
00:38:03,935 --> 00:38:04,701
YES, I DO.

420
00:38:06,837 --> 00:38:08,105
I WOULD LIKE TO GET
YOUR OPINION ON THIS.

421
00:38:20,518 --> 00:38:23,087
WHAT A HABIT
FOR A BOOKBINDER.

422
00:38:23,221 --> 00:38:25,155
"THE NINE GATES..."
SUPERB EDITION.

423
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,725
VERY RARE.
THE TELFER COPY.

424
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:31,795
YES, YOU USED
TO OWN IT, RIGHT?

425
00:38:31,929 --> 00:38:33,930
WE USED TO, YES.

426
00:38:34,065 --> 00:38:35,932
WE SOLD IT WHEN THE
OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED ITSELF.

427
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:38,135
- IT WAS TOO GOOD--
- TOO GOOD TO MISS.

428
00:38:38,269 --> 00:38:40,670
- AN EXCELLENT SALE.
- AN EXCELLENT BUY.

429
00:38:40,805 --> 00:38:42,506
IMPECCABLE CONDITION.

430
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,274
ARE YOU
THE PRESENT OWNER?

431
00:38:44,409 --> 00:38:47,111
NO. A CLIENT OF MINE.

432
00:38:47,245 --> 00:38:49,879
I WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED
SHE WOULD PART WITH IT, NEVER.

433
00:38:50,014 --> 00:38:50,747
SHE?

434
00:38:50,881 --> 00:38:52,116
MRS. TELFER.

435
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,851
UH-HUH.

436
00:38:54,986 --> 00:38:56,686
I UNDERSTOOD THAT...

437
00:38:56,821 --> 00:38:58,222
IT WAS MR. TELFER
THAT BOUGHT IT.

438
00:38:58,356 --> 00:39:00,056
HE PAID FOR IT.

439
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:02,993
IT WAS MRS. TELFER
THAT MADE HIM BUY IT.

440
00:39:03,128 --> 00:39:04,094
HE DIDN'T SEEM
PARTICULARLY INTERESTED.

441
00:39:05,896 --> 00:39:08,732
AN EXCEPTIONAL SPECIMEN.

442
00:39:08,866 --> 00:39:10,567
DO YOU THINK IT
COULD BE A FORGERY?

443
00:39:10,701 --> 00:39:12,202
- A FORGERY?
- YOU HEAR THAT?

444
00:39:12,337 --> 00:39:14,638
I TOOK YOU
FOR A PROFESSIONAL.

445
00:39:14,772 --> 00:39:15,972
YOU SPEAK TOO LIGHTLY
OF FORGERIES.

446
00:39:16,107 --> 00:39:17,508
FAR TOO LIGHTLY.

447
00:39:17,642 --> 00:39:20,377
FORGING A BOOK
IS VERY EXPENSIVE.

448
00:39:20,512 --> 00:39:22,846
PAPER OF THE PERIOD,
THE RIGHT INKS...

449
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,914
TOO EXPENSIVE
TO BE PROFITABLE.

450
00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:26,850
STILL, IT CAN BE DONE.

451
00:39:26,984 --> 00:39:29,753
IT REQUIRES A GREAT SKILL,
BUT, YES, I CAN BE DONE.

452
00:39:29,887 --> 00:39:31,888
DO YOU THINK THAT
COULD BE THE CASE HERE?

453
00:39:32,023 --> 00:39:33,557
WHAT MAKES YOU ASK?

454
00:39:33,691 --> 00:39:35,892
MY CLIENT WISHES
TO SATISFY HIMSELF

455
00:39:36,027 --> 00:39:38,295
ON THE BOOK'S AUTHENTICITY.
HIS NAME IS BALKAN.

456
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:41,131
BORIS BALKAN
OF NEW YORK.

457
00:39:41,266 --> 00:39:42,799
ALL BOOKS HAVE A
DESTINY OF THEIR OWN...

458
00:39:42,933 --> 00:39:44,601
AND A LIFE
OF THEIR OWN.

459
00:39:44,735 --> 00:39:46,836
MR. BALKAN IS A
CELEBRATED COLLECTOR.

460
00:39:46,971 --> 00:39:48,338
HE'S NO FOOL.

461
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:50,974
HE MUST KNOW THIS
BOOK IS AUTHENTIC.

462
00:39:51,108 --> 00:39:53,143
- WE KNOW IT.
- SO MUST HE.

463
00:39:53,278 --> 00:39:53,843
WE HAD THIS BOOK
FOR YEARS.

464
00:39:53,978 --> 00:39:55,445
MANY YEARS.

465
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,214
AMPLE OPPORTUNITY
TO STUDY IT THOROUGHLY.

466
00:39:57,348 --> 00:39:58,248
THE PRINTING...

467
00:39:58,383 --> 00:40:00,651
THE BINDING...

468
00:40:00,785 --> 00:40:04,087
ARE MAGNIFICENT EXAMPLES OF 17th
CENTURY VENETIAN CRAFTSMANSHIP.

469
00:40:04,222 --> 00:40:07,291
FINEST RAG PAPER, RESISTANT
TO THE PASSAGE OF TIME.

470
00:40:07,425 --> 00:40:09,859
NONE OF YOUR
MODERN WOOD PULP.

471
00:40:09,994 --> 00:40:11,961
WATERMARKS, INK...

472
00:40:12,096 --> 00:40:13,430
TYPEFACES...

473
00:40:14,632 --> 00:40:16,233
IF THIS IS A FORGERY...

474
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:18,101
OR A COPY WITH MISSING
PAGES RESTORED...

475
00:40:18,236 --> 00:40:19,002
IT'S THE WORK
OF A MASTER.

476
00:40:19,136 --> 00:40:20,337
A MASTER.

477
00:40:20,471 --> 00:40:23,039
HAVE YOU STUDIED
THE ENGRAVINGS?

478
00:40:23,174 --> 00:40:26,376
THEY SEEM TO HAVE SOME
UNDERLYING SIGNIFICANCE.

479
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:28,778
BUT OF COURSE.
HERE, FOR EXAMPLE...

480
00:40:28,913 --> 00:40:31,481
THIS ONE COULD BE
INTERPRETED AS A WARNING.

481
00:40:31,616 --> 00:40:34,084
"VENTURE TOO FAR,"
IT SEEMS TO SAY...

482
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:36,753
"AND DANGER WILL DESCEND
ON YOU FROM ABOVE."

483
00:40:36,887 --> 00:40:39,389
THIS TYPE OF BOOK
OFTEN CONTAINS

484
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:41,625
LITTLE PUZZLES...

485
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:43,627
ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF SUCH
AN ILLUSTRIOUS COLLABORATOR.

486
00:40:43,761 --> 00:40:46,730
COLLABORATOR?

487
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:48,699
YOU CANNOT HAVE PROCEEDED VERY
FAR IN YOUR RESEARCH, SEñOR.

488
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:50,934
HERE, LOOK CLOSE.

489
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:54,404
ONLY SIX OF THE NINE ENGRAVINGS
WERE SIGNED BY ARISTIDE TORCHIA.

490
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:57,574
AND THE OTHER THREE?

491
00:40:57,709 --> 00:40:59,443
THIS IS ONE OF THEM.

492
00:41:00,978 --> 00:41:02,946
"LCF"

493
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,081
WHO IS LCF?

494
00:41:05,216 --> 00:41:05,849
THINK.

495
00:41:12,757 --> 00:41:13,490
LUCIFER?

496
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:19,229
VERY PERCEPTIVE
OF YOU, SEñOR.

497
00:41:19,364 --> 00:41:22,499
TORCHIA WAS BURNED ALIVE...

498
00:41:22,634 --> 00:41:25,068
BECAUSE HE WROTE THIS BOOK IN
COLLABORATION WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

499
00:41:25,202 --> 00:41:27,804
COME ON! YOU CAN'T
HONESTLY BELIEVE...

500
00:41:27,938 --> 00:41:30,741
THE MAN WHO WROTE THIS BOOK DID
SO IN ALLIANCE WITH THE DEVIL...

501
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:32,842
AND WENT TO THE STAKE FOR IT.

502
00:41:32,977 --> 00:41:34,944
EVEN HELL HAS ITS
HEROES, SEñOR.

503
00:43:29,761 --> 00:43:31,561
I'VE SEEN YOU BEFORE.

504
00:43:31,696 --> 00:43:32,295
HAVE YOU?

505
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:33,162
YES.

506
00:43:35,466 --> 00:43:36,966
ARE YOU TRAVELING
IN THIS CAR?

507
00:43:37,101 --> 00:43:37,901
THE NEXT ONE.

508
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:39,536
THE SLEEPER.

509
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,471
I TRAVEL ON THE CHEAP.

510
00:43:41,606 --> 00:43:44,207
YOU'RE A STUDENT?

511
00:43:44,341 --> 00:43:46,242
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

512
00:43:46,377 --> 00:43:48,612
I LIKE TRAINS.

513
00:43:48,746 --> 00:43:50,414
TRAINS I'M ON?

514
00:43:50,548 --> 00:43:51,314
JUST TRAINS.

515
00:43:55,286 --> 00:43:56,787
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

516
00:43:56,921 --> 00:43:58,121
GUESS.

517
00:43:59,957 --> 00:44:01,758
GREEN EYES.

518
00:44:01,893 --> 00:44:03,794
THAT'LL DO.
WHAT'S YOURS?

519
00:44:03,928 --> 00:44:05,562
CORSO.

520
00:44:05,696 --> 00:44:07,363
STRANGE NAME.

521
00:44:07,498 --> 00:44:10,600
ITALIAN.
IT MEANS "RUN".

522
00:44:10,735 --> 00:44:12,302
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
A RUNNER TO ME...

523
00:44:12,437 --> 00:44:13,537
MORE THE QUIET TYPE.

524
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:21,344
WELL...

525
00:44:21,479 --> 00:44:23,613
GIVE MY REGARDS TO BALKAN.
TELL HIM I'M DOING MY BEST.

526
00:44:23,748 --> 00:44:25,248
BALKAN?

527
00:44:25,382 --> 00:44:27,317
NEVER MIND.

528
00:44:27,452 --> 00:44:29,218
SEE YOU AROUND...

529
00:44:29,353 --> 00:44:31,120
MAYBE.

530
00:44:31,255 --> 00:44:33,423
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED.

531
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:14,490
¿Sí?

532
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:17,827
DEAN CORSO,
MR. FARGAS.

533
00:46:17,962 --> 00:46:20,463
CORSO? OH, YES.
PLEASE COME IN.

534
00:46:28,806 --> 00:46:29,940
PLEASE.

535
00:46:34,845 --> 00:46:36,046
HOME, SWEET HOME!

536
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,687
YOU WON'T SAY NO TO A
BRANDY, I TAKE IT?

537
00:46:43,821 --> 00:46:44,554
THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

538
00:47:01,505 --> 00:47:04,107
WHAT HANDSOME GLASSES.

539
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:05,976
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES
I HAVE LEFT.

540
00:47:10,414 --> 00:47:12,315
MUST HAVE BEEN
A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.

541
00:47:12,449 --> 00:47:14,651
IT WAS.

542
00:47:14,785 --> 00:47:16,953
BUT OLD FAMILIES ARE LIKE
ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS...

543
00:47:17,088 --> 00:47:18,054
THEY WITHER AND DIE.

544
00:47:22,059 --> 00:47:26,395
THERE THEY ARE,
834 OF THEM.

545
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:29,298
A PITY YOU DIDN'T SEE THEM
IN BETTER TIMES.

546
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:30,566
I USED TO HAVE 5,000.

547
00:47:30,701 --> 00:47:33,436
BUT THESE ARE
THE SURVIVORS.

548
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:36,072
SO THIS IS THE
FARGAS COLLECTION?

549
00:47:36,206 --> 00:47:38,441
NOT QUITE AS I IMAGINED
IT, I MUST SAY.

550
00:47:38,575 --> 00:47:40,576
C'est la vie,
MY FRIEND.

551
00:47:40,711 --> 00:47:42,779
BUT I KEEP THEM
IN PERFECT CONDITION...

552
00:47:42,913 --> 00:47:44,914
SAFE FROM DAMP, LIGHT,
HEAT, RATS...

553
00:47:45,049 --> 00:47:46,983
I DUST AND
AIR THEM EVERY DAY.

554
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:54,858
THESE ARE THE "OCCULTS".

555
00:47:54,992 --> 00:47:56,225
WHAT
DO YOU THINK?

556
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,260
NOT BAD.

557
00:47:57,394 --> 00:47:59,162
NOT BAD INDEED.

558
00:47:59,296 --> 00:48:01,164
AT LEAST 10 OF THEM
ARE EXTREMELY RARE.

559
00:48:01,298 --> 00:48:03,767
HERE, PLANCY'S
"DICTIONNAIRE INFERNALE"...

560
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:08,672
FIRST EDITION, 1844.

561
00:48:11,942 --> 00:48:16,512
LEONARDO FIORAVANTI'S
"COMPENDI DI SECRETI", 1571...

562
00:48:21,786 --> 00:48:23,419
AND THERE IT IS...

563
00:48:23,554 --> 00:48:25,521
IN PERFECT CONDITION.

564
00:48:31,495 --> 00:48:34,497
IT HAS TRAVELED THE WORLD FOR
THREE-AND-A-HALF CENTURIES...

565
00:48:34,631 --> 00:48:35,932
YET IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
PRINTED YESTERDAY.

566
00:48:36,067 --> 00:48:38,001
IS IT IN ORDER?

567
00:48:38,135 --> 00:48:39,836
YOU HAVEN'T DETECTED
ANYTHING UNUSUAL?

568
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:41,504
UNUSUAL? NO.

569
00:48:41,638 --> 00:48:44,273
THE TEXT IS COMPLETE,
THE ENGRAVINGS TOO.

570
00:48:44,408 --> 00:48:47,577
NINE PLUS THE TITLE PAGE,
JUST AS THE CATALOG STATES.

571
00:48:47,712 --> 00:48:48,712
JUST LIKE THE KESSLER IN PARIS
AND THE TELFER IN NEW YORK.

572
00:48:51,481 --> 00:48:53,783
IT ISN'T
THE TELFER ANYMORE.

573
00:48:53,918 --> 00:48:56,019
TELFER KILLED HIMSELF.

574
00:48:56,153 --> 00:48:59,555
BUT HE SOLD HIS COPY
TO BORIS BALKAN FIRST.

575
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:01,624
AH, BALKAN.

576
00:49:01,759 --> 00:49:04,828
IF HE SETS HIS HEART ON A BOOK,
NO PRICE IS TOO HIGH.

577
00:49:04,962 --> 00:49:06,529
NOT THAT I WOULD EVER
SELL THIS ONE...

578
00:49:06,663 --> 00:49:07,831
NOT AT ANY PRICE.

579
00:49:12,169 --> 00:49:14,904
IT'S STRANGE HE SHOULD
HAVE SENT YOU HERE...

580
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:16,505
IF HE ALREADY HAD...

581
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,076
YOU HAVE IT HERE?

582
00:49:20,211 --> 00:49:21,477
MAY I SEE IT?

583
00:49:41,031 --> 00:49:42,632
AH, SUPERB...

584
00:49:47,905 --> 00:49:49,739
BEAUTIFUL...

585
00:49:49,874 --> 00:49:51,908
IDENTICAL.

586
00:49:52,042 --> 00:49:55,111
TWO OF THE ONLY THREE
TO HAVE ESCAPED THE FLAMES...

587
00:49:55,246 --> 00:49:56,846
REUNITED FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN OVER THREE CENTURIES.

588
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:01,684
AH, YES...

589
00:50:01,819 --> 00:50:03,153
LOOK AT THIS SLIGHT
IMPERFECTION HERE...

590
00:50:03,287 --> 00:50:04,420
THE DAMAGED "S".

591
00:50:04,554 --> 00:50:05,889
THE SAME TYPE,
THE SAME IMPRESSION.

592
00:50:09,026 --> 00:50:10,593
INCREDIBLE.

593
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:15,364
YOU SEE?

594
00:50:15,499 --> 00:50:17,000
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THIS
SLIGHT DISCOLORATION

595
00:50:17,134 --> 00:50:17,934
ON THE BACK
OF YOUR COPY...

596
00:50:18,068 --> 00:50:19,669
NO ONE COULD
TELL THEM APART.

597
00:50:19,804 --> 00:50:21,938
IF YOU DON'T MIND...

598
00:50:22,072 --> 00:50:23,840
I'D LIKE TO STAY FOR A WHILE
AND EXAMINE THEM IN DETAIL.

599
00:50:27,945 --> 00:50:30,213
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR, MR. CORSO?

600
00:50:30,347 --> 00:50:32,515
I'M NOT
QUITE SURE.

601
00:50:32,649 --> 00:50:34,617
SOME BOOKS
ARE DANGEROUS.

602
00:50:34,751 --> 00:50:36,452
NOT TO BE OPENED
WITH IMPUNITY.

603
00:50:36,586 --> 00:50:38,054
THAT'S VERY TRUE.

604
00:51:12,223 --> 00:51:13,990
I'LL BE DAMNED.

605
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,607
HELLO AGAIN.

606
00:54:18,742 --> 00:54:20,376
YOU DIDN'T SAY YOU
WERE BOUND FOR SINTRA.

607
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:21,844
NEITHER DID YOU.

608
00:54:21,979 --> 00:54:22,611
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

609
00:54:22,746 --> 00:54:24,546
READING.

610
00:54:24,681 --> 00:54:26,515
I CAN SEE THAT.

611
00:54:26,649 --> 00:54:29,085
AND BUMPING INTO PEOPLE.
UNEXPECTEDLY.

612
00:54:29,219 --> 00:54:32,154
YES.
UNEXPECTEDLY IS RIGHT.

613
00:54:32,289 --> 00:54:35,424
ARE YOU ON A
BUSINESS TRIP?

614
00:54:35,558 --> 00:54:37,459
IS THAT WHY YOU ALWAYS
CARRY THAT THING AROUND?

615
00:54:43,433 --> 00:54:44,466
IS THIS PART
OF YOUR COURSE?

616
00:54:44,601 --> 00:54:46,235
MY COURSE?

617
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:48,570
WINNING FRIENDS AND
INFLUENCING PEOPLE.

618
00:54:48,705 --> 00:54:50,306
YOU SAID YOU
WERE A STUDENT.

619
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,874
DID I?

620
00:54:52,009 --> 00:54:54,877
SO I AM. IN A WAY.

621
00:54:55,012 --> 00:54:57,880
I LIKE BOOKS.

622
00:54:58,015 --> 00:54:59,481
DO YOU?

623
00:55:02,619 --> 00:55:04,086
HAVE YOU BEEN
TRAVELING LONG?

624
00:55:04,221 --> 00:55:06,155
A WHILE.

625
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:09,325
<i>I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU EVER
TRAVEL BY MOTORBIKE?</i>

626
00:55:09,459 --> 00:55:11,427
EXCUSE ME, SEñOR,
TELEFONO PARA SEñOR.

627
00:55:11,561 --> 00:55:12,895
FOR ME?
ARE YOU SURE?

628
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:13,930
Sí, SEñOR.
Sí, SEñOR.

629
00:55:22,005 --> 00:55:24,773
- YES?
- Mr. Corso?

630
00:55:24,908 --> 00:55:26,742
MY GOD.
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

631
00:55:26,876 --> 00:55:29,045
Made any progress?

632
00:55:29,179 --> 00:55:30,947
PROGRESS? YEAH, YOU
COULD CALL IT THAT.

633
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:32,648
Well?

634
00:55:32,782 --> 00:55:34,883
LOOK, I CAN'T TALK HERE,
I'M IN THE LOBBY.

635
00:55:35,018 --> 00:55:36,685
LET ME CALL YOU BACK.
WHERE ARE YOU?

636
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:38,554
Never mind that.

637
00:55:38,688 --> 00:55:41,157
Get them to transfer it
to your room, I'll wait.

638
00:55:41,291 --> 00:55:42,925
ALL RIGHT.
SEñOR?

639
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:45,627
COULD YOU SEND THIS
UP TO MY ROOM, PLEASE?

640
00:55:45,762 --> 00:55:46,562
- YES.
- THANK YOU.

641
00:55:56,606 --> 00:55:58,907
- YOU STILL THERE?
- Yes.

642
00:55:59,042 --> 00:56:02,411
ALL RIGHT. I'VE EXAMINED
THE FARGAS COPY.

643
00:56:02,545 --> 00:56:04,813
IT'S AUTHENTIC ENOUGH,
AT LEAST IT LOOKS THAT WAY.

644
00:56:04,948 --> 00:56:07,116
IT'S LIKE YOURS, BUT THERE
ARE DISCREPANCIES.

645
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:09,452
Discrepancies?

646
00:56:09,586 --> 00:56:12,188
THE ENGRAVINGS -
THEY'RE NOT IDENTICAL.

647
00:56:12,322 --> 00:56:16,058
IT'S LIKE,
KEYS IN DIFFERENT HANDS...

648
00:56:16,193 --> 00:56:18,660
DOORWAYS OPEN IN ONE COPY AND
BRICKED UP IN THE OTHER...

649
00:56:18,795 --> 00:56:20,429
AND THERE'S ANOTHER THING.

650
00:56:20,563 --> 00:56:23,099
Yes, go on.

651
00:56:23,233 --> 00:56:25,968
THE ONES THAT DIFFER
AREN'T SIGNED "TORCHIA".

652
00:56:26,103 --> 00:56:27,703
THEY'RE SIGNED "LCF".

653
00:56:29,606 --> 00:56:30,739
YOU STILL THERE?

654
00:56:30,874 --> 00:56:32,241
<i>LCF?</i>

655
00:56:32,376 --> 00:56:34,410
LISTEN, WHERE
ARE YOU, ANYWAY?

656
00:56:34,544 --> 00:56:36,012
I must have
that copy, Mr. Corso.

657
00:56:36,146 --> 00:56:37,913
Get it for me.

658
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,884
THE OLD MAN WOULDN'T
SELL IT TO SAVE HIS LIFE.

659
00:56:42,019 --> 00:56:43,452
HE SAID AS MUCH.

660
00:56:43,586 --> 00:56:45,521
Did he?

661
00:56:45,655 --> 00:56:46,222
HELLO?

662
00:56:47,657 --> 00:56:49,091
HELLO?

663
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:22,658
JUST A MINUTE.

664
00:57:30,467 --> 00:57:31,434
YEAH?

665
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:42,511
WHAT TIME IS IT?

666
00:57:42,645 --> 00:57:45,214
EARLY, BUT YOU
HAVE TO GO.

667
00:57:45,348 --> 00:57:47,416
GO?
GO WHERE?

668
00:57:47,551 --> 00:57:49,085
- FARGAS'S PLACE.
- I ALREADY HAVE.

669
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:51,019
I THINK YOU SHOULD
SEE HIM AGAIN.

670
00:57:51,154 --> 00:57:53,389
WHAT IS THIS, SOME KIND
OF PRACTICAL JOKE?

671
00:57:53,523 --> 00:57:55,023
WHO ARE YOU?

672
00:57:55,158 --> 00:57:57,259
GET DRESSED.
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU OUTSIDE.

673
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:42,938
DON'T BOTHER.
HE ISN'T THERE.

674
00:58:43,072 --> 00:58:44,607
OH, REALLY?
THEN WHERE IS HE?

675
00:58:44,741 --> 00:58:46,509
OVER THERE.

676
00:59:16,306 --> 00:59:17,139
GOD ALMIGHTY.

677
00:59:32,355 --> 00:59:33,289
WANT TO GET INSIDE?

678
00:59:35,158 --> 00:59:36,358
I HAD THOUGHT
ABOUT IT, YES.

679
00:59:59,649 --> 01:00:01,216
YOU WAIT HERE.

680
01:00:25,909 --> 01:00:27,042
SHIT.

681
01:00:49,999 --> 01:00:52,167
WELL?
DID YOU FIND IT?

682
01:00:52,302 --> 01:00:55,704
IT'S COME TO MY ATTENTION
THAT YOU KNOW TOO GODDAMN MUCH.

683
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:58,140
WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?
WHO ARE YOU WORKING FOR?

684
01:00:58,274 --> 01:00:59,708
YOU'RE WASTING TIME.

685
01:00:59,843 --> 01:01:01,410
WE'D BETTER
GET OUT OF HERE.

686
01:01:01,545 --> 01:01:03,078
THERE'S A FLIGHT FROM
LISBON TO PARIS AT NOON.

687
01:01:03,212 --> 01:01:04,279
WE SHOULD JUST MAKE IT.

688
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:05,714
WHAT'S WITH
THE "WE"?

689
01:01:05,849 --> 01:01:07,382
THERE ARE TWO OF US,
AREN'T THERE?

690
01:01:07,517 --> 01:01:08,851
WHAT HAPPENED
BACK THERE?

691
01:01:16,092 --> 01:01:18,494
THE OLD MAN CAUGHT SOMEONE
STEALING, I GUESS.

692
01:01:18,628 --> 01:01:20,830
WHAT DO YOU GUESS
HAPPENED TO HIM?

693
01:01:20,964 --> 01:01:22,765
HE DROWNED.

694
01:01:22,899 --> 01:01:24,433
WITH A LITTLE
HELP FROM WHO?

695
01:01:24,568 --> 01:01:25,968
HE'S DEAD.
WHO CARES?

696
01:01:26,102 --> 01:01:28,103
I DO.

697
01:01:28,237 --> 01:01:30,539
I COULD EASILY
WIND UP THE SAME WAY.

698
01:01:30,674 --> 01:01:33,008
NOT WITH ME AROUND
TO LOOK AFTER YOU.

699
01:01:33,142 --> 01:01:35,811
I SEE. YOU'RE MY
GUARDIAN ANGEL THEN.

700
01:01:35,946 --> 01:01:36,946
IF YOU SAY SO.

701
01:01:41,952 --> 01:01:44,587
SOMEONE'S PLAYING
A GAME WITH ME.

702
01:01:44,721 --> 01:01:47,990
OF COURSE,
YOU'RE PART OF IT.

703
01:01:48,124 --> 01:01:49,592
AND YOU'RE
GETTING TO LIKE IT.

704
01:02:36,506 --> 01:02:38,206
HELLO, GRUBER.

705
01:02:38,341 --> 01:02:41,410
HELLO, MR. CORSO.
DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

706
01:02:41,545 --> 01:02:44,980
WE DON'T HAVE
ANY VACANCIES, BUT...

707
01:02:45,114 --> 01:02:46,314
I'M SURE I'LL BE ABLE
TO ORGANIZE SOMETHING.

708
01:02:50,787 --> 01:02:51,887
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

709
01:04:20,243 --> 01:04:22,210
GOOD AFTERNOON.

710
01:04:22,345 --> 01:04:23,946
I'M DEAN CORSO.

711
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:25,614
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH BARONESS KESSLER.

712
01:04:30,386 --> 01:04:31,386
THIS WAY.

713
01:04:40,463 --> 01:04:42,731
YOU HAVE
30 MINUTES.

714
01:04:49,572 --> 01:04:52,675
- YES?
- MONSIEUR CORSO.

715
01:04:52,809 --> 01:04:55,744
OH, YES, MR. CORSO.
COME IN.

716
01:04:55,879 --> 01:04:58,380
I'VE HEARD A GREAT
DEAL ABOUT YOU.

717
01:04:58,514 --> 01:05:00,916
NOTHING GOOD,
I HOPE.

718
01:05:01,051 --> 01:05:02,818
YOU HOPE RIGHT.
Merci, Simone.

719
01:05:02,952 --> 01:05:05,988
I'M REASSURED, BARONESS,
BECAUSE...

720
01:05:06,122 --> 01:05:08,223
IN MY TRADE,
TO BE SPOKEN WELL OF...

721
01:05:08,357 --> 01:05:09,758
CAN BE PROFESSIONALLY
DISASTROUS.

722
01:05:11,895 --> 01:05:13,461
MY GOD.

723
01:05:13,596 --> 01:05:16,065
YES, THERE IT IS.
THE KESSLER COLLECTION.

724
01:05:19,736 --> 01:05:22,270
YOU KNOW, I KNOW YOUR
CATALOG ALMOST BY HEART.

725
01:05:22,405 --> 01:05:24,272
STRANGE WE HAVEN'T
MET BEFORE.

726
01:05:24,407 --> 01:05:27,042
YOUR NAME IS A BYWORD AMONG
DEALERS AND COLLECTORS.

727
01:05:27,177 --> 01:05:31,113
BUT I IMAGINE YOU KNOW YOUR OWN
REPUTATION BETTER THAN I DO.

728
01:05:31,247 --> 01:05:34,750
IT DOES KEEP THE WOLF
FROM THE DOOR, SO TO SPEAK.

729
01:05:34,884 --> 01:05:36,685
I'M SORRY, BARONESS, WERE YOU
IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING?

730
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:39,387
"THE DEVIL, HISTORY AND MYTH",

731
01:05:39,522 --> 01:05:41,090
A KIND OF BIOGRAPHY.

732
01:05:41,224 --> 01:05:43,425
IT WILL BE PUBLISHED
EARLY NEXT YEAR.

733
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:45,327
WHY THE DEVIL?

734
01:05:45,461 --> 01:05:46,561
I SAW HIM ONE DAY.

735
01:05:46,696 --> 01:05:48,897
I WAS 15 YEARS OLD...

736
01:05:49,032 --> 01:05:50,833
AND I SAW HIM AS PLAIN
AS I SEE YOU NOW.

737
01:05:50,967 --> 01:05:52,735
IT WAS LOVE
AT FIRST SIGHT.

738
01:05:52,869 --> 01:05:55,437
300 YEARS AGO, YOU'D
HAVE BEEN BURNED AT THE STAKE...

739
01:05:55,571 --> 01:05:57,372
FOR SAYING
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

740
01:05:57,506 --> 01:06:00,275
300 YEARS AGO
I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID IT.

741
01:06:00,409 --> 01:06:04,213
NOR WOULD I HAVE MADE A MILLION
BY WRITING ABOUT IT.

742
01:06:04,347 --> 01:06:08,183
WHAT IS IT YOU WISH TO DISCUSS,
MR. CORSO?

743
01:06:08,317 --> 01:06:09,985
THERE'S A BOOK IN YOUR
COLLECTION I'D LIKE TO EXAMINE,

744
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,187
IF POSSIBLE.

745
01:06:12,321 --> 01:06:14,123
IT'S "THE BOOK OF THE NINE GATES
OF THE KINGDOM OF SHADOWS"?

746
01:06:14,257 --> 01:06:16,725
"THE NINE GATES."
AN INTERESTING WORK.

747
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:18,827
EVERYONE'S BEEN ASKING ME
ABOUT IT LATELY.

748
01:06:18,962 --> 01:06:20,295
IS THAT SO?

749
01:06:20,429 --> 01:06:21,463
FOLLOW ME.

750
01:06:25,334 --> 01:06:28,871
DO YOU TRULY BELIEVE
IN THE DEVIL, BARONESS?

751
01:06:29,005 --> 01:06:31,840
ENOUGH TO DEVOTE MY LIFE,
AND MY LIBRARY, TO HIM.

752
01:06:31,975 --> 01:06:33,809
NOT TO MENTION MANY
YEARS OF WORK.

753
01:06:33,943 --> 01:06:36,745
DON'T YOU?

754
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:37,980
ALMOST.

755
01:06:40,416 --> 01:06:43,485
THIS BOOK DEMANDS A
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FAITH.

756
01:06:43,619 --> 01:06:45,687
I'M AFRAID MY FAITH IS
IN SHORT SUPPLY THESE DAYS.

757
01:06:45,822 --> 01:06:48,590
I KNOW THIS WORK
EXTREMELY WELL.

758
01:06:48,724 --> 01:06:50,659
I'VE STUDIED
IT FOR YEARS.

759
01:06:50,794 --> 01:06:52,494
DO YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS
ABOUT ITS AUTHENTICITY?

760
01:06:52,628 --> 01:06:54,396
NONE WHATSOEVER.

761
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:56,531
YOU'RE SURE?

762
01:06:56,666 --> 01:06:58,400
MY KNOWLEDGE OF THIS
BOOK IS PROFOUND.

763
01:06:58,534 --> 01:06:59,835
I WROTE A BIOGRAPHY
OF ITS AUTHOR.

764
01:06:59,969 --> 01:07:01,536
I'VE READ IT.

765
01:07:01,671 --> 01:07:02,838
"ARISTIDE DE TORCHIA,
THE DEVIL'S APPRENTICE".

766
01:07:02,972 --> 01:07:04,339
EXCELLENT WORK.

767
01:07:04,473 --> 01:07:06,842
A COURAGEOUS MAN.

768
01:07:06,976 --> 01:07:10,846
HE DIED FOR THE SAKE OF
THIS VERY BOOK, IN 1667.

769
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:13,581
WHILE STUDYING
THE BLACK ARTS IN PRAGUE...

770
01:07:13,716 --> 01:07:16,618
HE ACQUIRED A COPY OF
THE DREAD DELOMELANICON.

771
01:07:16,752 --> 01:07:19,154
THIS IS TORCHIA'S ADAPTATION
OF THAT WORK...

772
01:07:19,289 --> 01:07:21,423
WHICH WAS WRITTEN
BY LUCIFER HIMSELF.

773
01:07:21,557 --> 01:07:23,926
AFTER THEY BURNED HIM
AT THE STAKE...

774
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:26,128
A SECRET SOCIETY
WAS FOUNDED...

775
01:07:26,262 --> 01:07:28,897
TO PERPETUATE ITS MEMORY
AND PRESERVE ITS SECRETS.

776
01:07:29,032 --> 01:07:30,765
"THE ORDER
OF THE SILVER SERPENT."

777
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:32,600
A SECT?

778
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:36,638
A KIND OF
WITCHES' COVEN.

779
01:07:36,772 --> 01:07:38,974
FOR CENTURIES THEY HAVE MET
TO READ FROM THIS BOOK...

780
01:07:39,108 --> 01:07:40,709
AND WORSHIP
THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS.

781
01:07:40,844 --> 01:07:42,377
TODAY, THEY HAVE DEGENERATED

782
01:07:42,511 --> 01:07:44,279
INTO A SOCIAL CLUB...

783
01:07:44,413 --> 01:07:46,949
FOR BORED MILLIONAIRES
AND CELEBRITIES...

784
01:07:47,083 --> 01:07:49,151
WHO USE ITS MEETINGS...

785
01:07:49,285 --> 01:07:52,620
AS AN EXCUSE TO INDULGE THEIR
JADED SEXUAL APPETITES.

786
01:07:52,755 --> 01:07:55,590
I, MYSELF,
BELONGED TO THE ORDER...

787
01:07:55,725 --> 01:07:59,561
YEARS AGO, BUT TIME IS
TOO PRECIOUS AT MY AGE.

788
01:07:59,695 --> 01:08:02,464
BESIDES, MY ORGY DAYS
ARE OVER.

789
01:08:02,598 --> 01:08:04,432
I TOLD THEM TO
GO TO THE DEVIL.

790
01:08:06,402 --> 01:08:08,136
YOU MEAN IT'S ALL
ABOUT SEX, OR...?

791
01:08:08,271 --> 01:08:09,437
OF COURSE NOT.

792
01:08:09,572 --> 01:08:11,273
THEY ARE UNDER
THE ILLUSION...

793
01:08:11,407 --> 01:08:13,308
THAT THEY OWE THEIR
MONEY AND SUCCESS...

794
01:08:13,442 --> 01:08:14,676
TO MEMBERSHIP
IN THE ORDER.

795
01:08:14,810 --> 01:08:15,911
DO THEY STILL MEET?

796
01:08:16,045 --> 01:08:17,479
EVERY YEAR...

797
01:08:17,613 --> 01:08:19,614
ON THE ANNIVERSARY
OF TORCHIA'S DEATH.

798
01:08:19,749 --> 01:08:21,850
THEY'LL BE MEETING
VERY SOON NOW.

799
01:08:21,985 --> 01:08:23,385
AND YOU SAY THEY READ
FROM THIS BOOK.

800
01:08:23,519 --> 01:08:24,219
NOT THIS ONE.

801
01:08:24,354 --> 01:08:25,954
I TOOK MINE BACK

802
01:08:26,089 --> 01:08:28,623
WHEN LIANA TELFER ACQUIRED
THE ONE IN TOLEDO.

803
01:08:28,758 --> 01:08:30,993
VICTOR FARGAS IS
AN UNBELIEVER...

804
01:08:31,127 --> 01:08:33,495
HE'S ALWAYS REFUSED
TO PARTICIPATE...

805
01:08:33,629 --> 01:08:36,064
SO NATURALLY THEY USE
THE TELFER COPY.

806
01:08:36,199 --> 01:08:38,033
NOT THAT IT HAS
EVER WORKED.

807
01:08:38,167 --> 01:08:39,968
DID ANDREW TELFER
EVER TAKE PART?

808
01:08:40,103 --> 01:08:42,304
TELFER?!
OH, NO, NO.

809
01:08:42,438 --> 01:08:47,943
THAT CREATURE, LIANA,
MARRIED HIM FOR HIS MONEY.

810
01:08:48,077 --> 01:08:51,246
SHE COMES OF AN OLD AND
ARISTOCRATIC FRENCH FAMILY...

811
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:53,481
THE SAINT-MARTIN'S,
BUT THEY WERE PENNILESS...

812
01:08:53,616 --> 01:08:57,052
SO LIANA USED HIS DOLLARS
TO RESTORE HER CHATEAU...

813
01:08:57,186 --> 01:08:58,486
AND BUY
"THE NINE GATES".

814
01:08:58,621 --> 01:09:00,222
IF HE EVER FINDS OUT

815
01:09:00,356 --> 01:09:02,991
WHAT HIS WIFE GETS UP TO
AT THESE GATHERINGS...

816
01:09:03,126 --> 01:09:05,060
HE'LL PROBABLY
KILL HIMSELF.

817
01:09:05,194 --> 01:09:07,362
FUNNY YOU SHOULD
SAY THAT, BARONESS...

818
01:09:07,496 --> 01:09:08,630
HE HANGED HIMSELF
LAST WEEK.

819
01:09:13,937 --> 01:09:17,505
WHO, EXACTLY, ARE YOU
WORKING FOR, MR. CORSO?

820
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,908
MY CLIENT'S NAME
IS IRRELEVANT, BARONESS.

821
01:09:20,043 --> 01:09:22,444
I'M SIMPLY TRYING TO
AUTHENTICATE HIS COPY...

822
01:09:22,578 --> 01:09:24,947
THE ONE THAT TELFER
SOLD HIM BEFORE HE DIED.

823
01:09:25,081 --> 01:09:27,882
HOW STUPID OF ME.
I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED.

824
01:09:28,017 --> 01:09:32,787
YOU'VE OUTSTAYED
YOUR WELCOME, MR. CORSO.

825
01:09:32,922 --> 01:09:34,889
I WAS HOPING TO EXAMINE
YOUR COPY IN DETAIL.

826
01:09:35,024 --> 01:09:37,059
CERTAINLY NOT.

827
01:09:37,193 --> 01:09:41,129
TELL YOUR CLIENT, WHO CAN
ONLY BE BORIS BALKAN...

828
01:09:41,264 --> 01:09:45,067
TO COME AND EXAMINE IT
HIMSELF, IF HE DARES.

829
01:09:45,201 --> 01:09:49,171
TELL HIM NOT TO SEND ANY MORE
"WOLVES IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING".

830
01:09:49,305 --> 01:09:50,439
NOW, KINDLY LEAVE.

831
01:09:55,845 --> 01:09:59,314
I'M SORRY IF
I HAVE TROUBLED YOU.

832
01:09:59,449 --> 01:10:01,283
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.

833
01:10:01,417 --> 01:10:04,386
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING INTO, MR. CORSO.

834
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:08,023
GET OUT,
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

835
01:10:08,157 --> 01:10:11,159
I'M AFRAID IT ALREADY IS,
BARONESS. GOOD DAY.

836
01:10:19,935 --> 01:10:22,570
OUI... OUI.

837
01:14:04,026 --> 01:14:06,594
THEY'RE BROKEN.

838
01:14:06,728 --> 01:14:08,496
YOU SHOULD BE
MORE CAREFUL.

839
01:14:24,113 --> 01:14:25,680
I NEED A FAVOR,
GRUBER.

840
01:14:25,814 --> 01:14:27,348
CERTAINLY,
MR. CORSO.

841
01:14:27,483 --> 01:14:30,285
LIANA TELFER.

842
01:14:30,419 --> 01:14:33,821
MAIDEN NAME "DE SAINT-MARTIN",
FORTY-ISH, BRUNETTE, DISHY.

843
01:14:33,956 --> 01:14:37,925
PROBABLY ACCOMPANIED BY...

844
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:40,462
A BLACK GENTLEMAN...

845
01:14:40,596 --> 01:14:43,064
WITH CLOSELY CROPPED

846
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:44,899
PLATINUM BLOND HAIR...

847
01:14:45,033 --> 01:14:47,635
AND A MUSTACHE.
I WANT TO KNOW...

848
01:14:47,769 --> 01:14:49,504
IF THEY'RE STAYING
HERE IN PARIS.

849
01:14:49,638 --> 01:14:50,771
IT COULD TAKE
A LITTLE TIME.

850
01:14:50,906 --> 01:14:52,607
OF COURSE.

851
01:14:52,741 --> 01:14:53,475
START WITH THE FIVE-STARS,
THAT'S YOUR BEST BET.

852
01:14:53,609 --> 01:14:55,210
VERY WELL, SIR.

853
01:14:55,344 --> 01:14:56,877
ARE YOU FEELING
ALL RIGHT?

854
01:14:57,012 --> 01:15:01,649
I'VE FELT BETTER,
GRUBER. THANKS.

855
01:15:01,783 --> 01:15:03,418
LET ME KNOW IF
YOU LOCATE THEM.

856
01:15:17,099 --> 01:15:17,865
PUT THIS...

857
01:15:20,169 --> 01:15:21,236
AGAINST THE BACK
OF YOUR NECK.

858
01:15:34,416 --> 01:15:37,452
YOU WERE REALLY GREAT
DOWN THERE BY THE RIVER.

859
01:15:37,586 --> 01:15:38,653
I HAVEN'T
THANKED YOU FOR THAT.

860
01:16:19,895 --> 01:16:21,796
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

861
01:16:21,930 --> 01:16:24,031
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME

862
01:16:24,166 --> 01:16:25,733
YOU TOLD ME WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE.

863
01:16:25,867 --> 01:16:28,069
SOMEONE'S AFTER
YOUR BOOK.

864
01:16:28,204 --> 01:16:29,671
NO KIDDING.

865
01:16:29,805 --> 01:16:31,406
AND YOU, WHERE DO
YOU FIT IN?

866
01:16:40,583 --> 01:16:41,048
YEAH?

867
01:16:47,189 --> 01:16:49,056
MAY I TAKE IT
IN RECEPTION, PLEASE?

868
01:16:51,594 --> 01:16:52,927
RIGHT, I'LL BE
RIGHT DOWN.

869
01:17:06,475 --> 01:17:07,775
YES?

870
01:17:07,909 --> 01:17:09,977
Anything new?

871
01:17:10,112 --> 01:17:11,846
HIS MASTER'S VOICE AGAIN.

872
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:15,250
NO, NOT MUCH ASIDE
FROM THE FACT THAT...

873
01:17:15,384 --> 01:17:17,151
SOMEONE'S TRIED TO TAKE
MY LIFE A COUPLE OF TIMES.

874
01:17:17,286 --> 01:17:20,221
OH, YES, FARGAS HAS
BEEN MURDERED.

875
01:17:22,691 --> 01:17:25,159
Murdered?
How do you know?

876
01:17:25,294 --> 01:17:27,895
I SAW HIM.
AND HIS COPY.

877
01:17:28,029 --> 01:17:29,631
OR WHAT WAS LEFT
OF IT, ANYWAY.

878
01:17:29,765 --> 01:17:32,500
SOMEONE HAD SNATCHED
THE ENGRAVINGS...

879
01:17:32,635 --> 01:17:34,569
AND TRIED TO BURN THE REST.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?

880
01:17:34,703 --> 01:17:37,605
That's tragic.
It's tragic.

881
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:40,875
What about Baroness Kessler?
How did you get on today?

882
01:17:41,009 --> 01:17:43,578
- WHERE EXACTLY ARE YOU?
- What about her copy?

883
01:17:43,712 --> 01:17:45,480
NO. WHY DO I GET
THE IMPRESSION...

884
01:17:45,614 --> 01:17:47,548
THAT YOU'VE BEEN BREATHING
DOWN MY NECK THE ENTIRE TIME?

885
01:17:47,683 --> 01:17:50,217
You're an investment
of mine, Mr. Corso.

886
01:17:50,352 --> 01:17:51,452
I'm merely
looking after it.

887
01:17:55,758 --> 01:17:58,493
THE OLD WOMAN SWEARS
HER COPY'S AUTHENTIC...

888
01:17:58,627 --> 01:18:00,762
BUT I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO EXAMINE IT CLOSELY.

889
01:18:00,896 --> 01:18:03,197
SHE THREW ME OUT
AS SOON AS SHE GUESSED...

890
01:18:03,332 --> 01:18:05,933
THAT YOU WERE
BEHIND MY VISIT.

891
01:18:06,067 --> 01:18:07,802
YOU AREN'T EXACTLY IN HER GOOD
BOOKS, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

892
01:18:07,936 --> 01:18:10,338
You must see her again.

893
01:18:10,472 --> 01:18:12,039
ARE YOU KIDDING?
HAVE YOU SEEN HER SECRETARY?

894
01:18:12,174 --> 01:18:13,741
Try the lunch break.

895
01:18:16,178 --> 01:18:17,412
HELLO?

896
01:18:46,141 --> 01:18:48,275
DO YOU HAVE A PHOTOCOPY
MACHINE BACK THERE?

897
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:50,211
YES, M'SIEUR.

898
01:18:50,346 --> 01:18:51,512
- MAY I USE IT?
- OF COURSE, M'SIEUR.

899
01:21:48,691 --> 01:21:52,459
OUI?

900
01:21:52,594 --> 01:21:56,363
HELLO, BARONESS, IT'S ME,
THE "WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING".

901
01:21:56,498 --> 01:22:00,601
I THOUGHT I MADE MYSELF
QUITE CLEAR, MR. CORSO.

902
01:22:00,736 --> 01:22:03,871
WELL, I'VE GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU, BARONESS.

903
01:22:04,006 --> 01:22:06,874
A KIND OF PEACE OFFERING.

904
01:22:07,009 --> 01:22:08,642
WILL YOU ALLOW ME
TO GIVE IT TO YOU?

905
01:22:08,777 --> 01:22:11,278
PLEASE?

906
01:22:36,138 --> 01:22:38,405
FIRST, LET ME
APOLOGIZE.

907
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:40,474
I SHOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU RIGHT AWAY...

908
01:22:40,609 --> 01:22:41,609
THAT I'M WORKING
FOR BORIS BALKAN.

909
01:22:41,744 --> 01:22:44,612
IT WAS FOOLISH
OF ME TO THINK

910
01:22:44,747 --> 01:22:46,214
THAT I COULD DECEIVE SOMEONE
AS ASTUTE AS YOURSELF.

911
01:22:46,348 --> 01:22:48,182
SO, PLEASE
FORGIVE ME.

912
01:22:48,316 --> 01:22:50,752
FLATTERY WILL GET YOU NOWHERE, MR.
CORSO.

913
01:22:50,886 --> 01:22:53,587
GET ON WITH IT.

914
01:22:53,722 --> 01:22:55,223
RIGHT.

915
01:22:56,725 --> 01:22:57,725
THESE...

916
01:23:00,262 --> 01:23:01,328
...ARE FOR YOU.

917
01:23:04,032 --> 01:23:05,532
WHAT IS THIS...?

918
01:23:05,667 --> 01:23:08,836
WHAT IS THIS
SUPPOSED TO BE?

919
01:23:08,971 --> 01:23:12,640
YOU SAID YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF "THE
NINE GATES" WAS EXTENSIVE,

920
01:23:12,775 --> 01:23:15,376
BUT DID YOU EVER COMPARE YOUR
COPY WITH THE OTHER TWO?

921
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:18,112
NO, WHY?

922
01:23:18,247 --> 01:23:20,714
WELL, YOU SHOULD.

923
01:23:20,849 --> 01:23:23,450
THESE ARE COPIES OF THE
ENGRAVINGS IN BALKAN'S BOOK.

924
01:23:23,585 --> 01:23:26,287
YOU'LL FIND THAT SOME OF
THEM DIFFER FROM YOURS.

925
01:23:26,421 --> 01:23:28,156
DIFFER?

926
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:33,294
SO YOU QUESTION MY BOOK'S
AUTHENTICITY, DO YOU?

927
01:23:33,428 --> 01:23:35,763
IF THAT'S YOUR PEACE OFFERING,
YOU CAN TAKE IT AND GO.

928
01:23:35,898 --> 01:23:38,399
MY "NINE GATES"
IS ABSOLUTELY GENUINE.

929
01:23:38,533 --> 01:23:40,534
I DON'T DISPUTE
THAT, BARONESS.

930
01:23:40,669 --> 01:23:43,137
IN MY OPINION, ALL THREE
COPIES ARE GENUINE.

931
01:23:43,272 --> 01:23:45,273
BUT THE FACT REMAINS,
THEY DISPLAY VARIATIONS.

932
01:23:45,407 --> 01:23:47,108
VARIATIONS?

933
01:23:47,242 --> 01:23:50,778
IF THAT WERE TRUE,
IT WOULD BE A REVELATION.

934
01:23:50,913 --> 01:23:53,181
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

935
01:23:53,315 --> 01:23:56,550
I'VE ALREADY
COMPARED THESE...

936
01:23:56,685 --> 01:23:58,219
WITH THE FARGAS
ENGRAVINGS.

937
01:23:58,353 --> 01:24:01,555
AND IN HIS BOOK...

938
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:03,424
THE KEYS WERE IN
THE OTHER HAND.

939
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:08,429
HERE, THE DOORWAY
WASN'T BRICKED UP.

940
01:24:08,563 --> 01:24:11,532
AND IN THIS ONE...

941
01:24:11,666 --> 01:24:12,633
THE MAN WAS HANGING
BY THE OTHER LEG.

942
01:24:29,218 --> 01:24:30,651
WELL?

943
01:24:30,785 --> 01:24:32,419
WELL, WHAT?

944
01:24:35,623 --> 01:24:36,958
LOOK CLOSELY,
BARONESS.

945
01:24:38,693 --> 01:24:40,228
THE TURRETS.

946
01:24:40,362 --> 01:24:42,263
THREE IN YOURS...

947
01:24:42,397 --> 01:24:43,731
FOUR IN BALKAN'S.

948
01:24:56,044 --> 01:24:58,179
AMAZING.

949
01:24:58,313 --> 01:25:01,548
I'M CONVINCED THERE'LL BE A
THIRD ONE IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

950
01:25:01,683 --> 01:25:05,019
THREE VARIATIONS IN
THREE COPIES MAKES NINE.

951
01:25:05,153 --> 01:25:08,789
COINCIDENCE,
OR SOMETHING MORE?

952
01:25:08,924 --> 01:25:11,125
MAYBE TORCHIA HID THE
SECRET OF THE NINTH GATE...

953
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:14,795
IN THREE BOOKS,
NOT ONE.

954
01:25:14,930 --> 01:25:17,899
I MUST ADMIT
I'M IMPRESSED.

955
01:25:18,033 --> 01:25:20,834
THIS PUTS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
COMPLEXION ON THE MATTER.

956
01:25:20,969 --> 01:25:25,206
YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION TO
INVESTIGATE FURTHER, MR. CORSO.

957
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:27,174
TAKE AS LONG AS YOU NEED.

958
01:25:44,026 --> 01:25:47,494
MY PERMISSION DID NOT
EXTEND TO THAT, MR. CORSO.

959
01:25:47,629 --> 01:25:50,398
NOBODY SMOKES
IN MY LIBRARY.

960
01:28:34,463 --> 01:28:35,629
BARONESS?

961
01:31:24,899 --> 01:31:27,234
EXCUSE ME, THERE'S SOMETHING
MISSING FROM MY ROOM.

962
01:31:27,369 --> 01:31:29,236
HAS ANYONE BEEN UP THERE
WHILE I WAS OUT?

963
01:31:29,371 --> 01:31:31,405
ONLY YOUR WIFE, M'SIEUR.

964
01:31:31,539 --> 01:31:33,807
MY WIFE?
I DON'T HAVE A WIFE.

965
01:31:33,941 --> 01:31:35,809
EXCUSE ME.

966
01:31:39,614 --> 01:31:41,515
FOR YOU, SIR.
BOOTH TWO.

967
01:31:46,421 --> 01:31:48,389
YES?

968
01:31:48,523 --> 01:31:51,492
What news?

969
01:31:51,626 --> 01:31:55,596
NEWS?
LET ME SEE.

970
01:31:55,730 --> 01:31:58,332
THE GOOD NEWS...

971
01:31:58,466 --> 01:32:01,067
IS THAT I GOT TO EXAMINE
THE OLD WOMAN'S BOOK.

972
01:32:01,202 --> 01:32:03,870
AND THREE OF HER ENGRAVINGS
WERE SIGNED "LCF".

973
01:32:04,005 --> 01:32:06,373
THE BAD NEWS IS THAT
SOMEONE STRANGLED HER...

974
01:32:06,508 --> 01:32:08,842
AND MADE A BONFIRE
OF HER COLLECTION.

975
01:32:08,976 --> 01:32:10,243
NOW THAT'S TRAGIC,
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

976
01:32:10,378 --> 01:32:12,579
You took the words
out my mouth.

977
01:32:12,714 --> 01:32:15,316
YES. IT'S THE FARGAS STORY
ALL OVER AGAIN.

978
01:32:15,450 --> 01:32:18,018
I'M OF THE MIND THAT THEY
TORE OUT THE ENGRAVINGS...

979
01:32:18,152 --> 01:32:19,820
BEFORE THEY
TORCHED THE PLACE.

980
01:32:19,954 --> 01:32:21,655
THAT MAKES TWO
SETS THEY'VE GOT.

981
01:32:21,790 --> 01:32:24,090
And my copy?

982
01:32:24,225 --> 01:32:27,093
WELL, I'VE LEARNED
MY LESSON...

983
01:32:27,228 --> 01:32:29,496
FORTUNATELY I DON'T
CARRY IT AROUND ANY MORE.

984
01:32:29,631 --> 01:32:31,432
OTHERWISE IT MIGHT HAVE
GONE UP IN SMOKE.

985
01:32:31,566 --> 01:32:34,267
Excellent.
Good thinking.

986
01:32:34,402 --> 01:32:36,770
Well, with two copies gone...

987
01:32:36,904 --> 01:32:38,905
that seems to conclude
your assignment.

988
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,974
It only remains for you
to return my book.

989
01:32:41,108 --> 01:32:42,909
I'm staying at the Ritz...

990
01:32:43,044 --> 01:32:44,478
You can pick up your check
at the same time.

991
01:32:44,612 --> 01:32:47,748
Shall we say
in half an hour?

992
01:32:47,882 --> 01:32:49,950
THERE'S MORE BAD NEWS.

993
01:32:50,084 --> 01:32:52,553
I DON'T HAVE IT.

994
01:32:52,687 --> 01:32:54,888
You don't have it?

995
01:32:55,022 --> 01:32:57,023
SOMEONE LIFTED IT
FROM MY ROOM.

996
01:33:01,763 --> 01:33:05,232
Listen to me very
carefully, Mr. Corso.

997
01:33:05,367 --> 01:33:08,602
I think you may already
have some idea...

998
01:33:08,737 --> 01:33:10,804
of the lengths to which
I am prepared to go...

999
01:33:10,938 --> 01:33:13,574
when I want something.

1000
01:33:13,708 --> 01:33:18,912
Unless you recover my property
in double-quick time...

1001
01:33:19,046 --> 01:33:22,148
you'll discover just
how far that can be.

1002
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:34,695
WHERE IS IT?

1003
01:33:34,829 --> 01:33:36,162
WHERE'S WHAT?

1004
01:33:36,297 --> 01:33:38,064
THE BOOK,
WHERE IS IT?

1005
01:33:38,199 --> 01:33:39,867
WOULD I BE HERE
IF I TOOK IT?

1006
01:33:40,001 --> 01:33:40,834
HUH? YOU SHOULD
KNOW BETTER BY NOW.

1007
01:33:48,877 --> 01:33:50,711
I MUST APOLOGIZE FOR MY YOUNG
COLLEAGUE, MR. CORSO...

1008
01:33:50,845 --> 01:33:52,479
THAT WAS UNPARDONABLE.

1009
01:33:52,614 --> 01:33:53,346
IS THAT HER?

1010
01:33:55,617 --> 01:33:57,384
NO, SIR. SHE WAS
TALL, DARK HAIR...

1011
01:33:57,519 --> 01:33:59,286
VERY CHIC,
VERY ELEGANT.

1012
01:33:59,421 --> 01:34:01,054
WHICH REMINDS ME, SIR.

1013
01:34:01,188 --> 01:34:02,355
I HAVE THE INFORMATION
YOU WANTED.

1014
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:04,257
THE LADY AND GENTLEMAN
YOU MENTIONED...

1015
01:34:04,392 --> 01:34:07,561
THEY ARE STAYING AT
THE PLAZA ATHENA HOTEL...

1016
01:34:07,695 --> 01:34:10,096
SUITE 209-211.

1017
01:34:10,231 --> 01:34:11,732
THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, GRUBER.

1018
01:34:11,866 --> 01:34:13,700
I OWE YOU ONE.

1019
01:34:13,835 --> 01:34:14,968
I NEED A TAXI, QUICK.

1020
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:20,574
SEND THIS TO MR. BALKAN
AT THE RITZ.

1021
01:34:20,708 --> 01:34:21,508
THAT'S B-A-L-K-A-N.

1022
01:34:24,378 --> 01:34:25,779
FAX IT, IMMEDIATELY.

1023
01:34:25,914 --> 01:34:27,380
CERTAINLY, SIR.

1024
01:34:29,851 --> 01:34:31,117
ALWAYS A PLEASURE
TO BE OF SERVICE.

1025
01:34:31,252 --> 01:34:32,686
YOU COMING?

1026
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:46,567
M'SIEUR?

1027
01:34:52,707 --> 01:34:55,075
WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO
IF YOU SEE THEM?

1028
01:34:55,209 --> 01:34:56,810
PROBABLY HIDE
BEHIND YOU.

1029
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,066
THAT'S THEM.
IT'S THEM.

1030
01:35:56,704 --> 01:35:58,772
WE SHOULD GRAB A TAXI
BEFORE THEY TAKE OFF.

1031
01:35:58,907 --> 01:36:00,106
LET'S GO.

1032
01:36:18,993 --> 01:36:19,893
THEY ARE GOING.

1033
01:36:53,828 --> 01:36:54,761
COMING?

1034
01:37:07,609 --> 01:37:08,942
HOW ABOUT SOMETHING
LESS CONSPICUOUS?

1035
01:37:09,077 --> 01:37:11,111
DON'T BE SO PICKY.

1036
01:37:11,245 --> 01:37:12,846
SOME PEOPLE WOULD GIVE THEIR
EYE-TEETH FOR A RIDE IN THIS.

1037
01:37:50,918 --> 01:37:52,352
WE CAN'T SIT ON
THEIR TAIL FOREVER...

1038
01:37:52,486 --> 01:37:53,053
THEY'RE BOUND
TO SMELL A RAT.

1039
01:38:18,245 --> 01:38:19,179
HOW DO I LOOK?

1040
01:38:21,382 --> 01:38:22,049
RIDICULOUS.

1041
01:38:30,825 --> 01:38:32,358
SIT TIGHT.

1042
01:39:21,442 --> 01:39:22,042
TAKE YOUR PICK.

1043
01:39:24,311 --> 01:39:26,379
NO, YOU.
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING.

1044
01:39:26,513 --> 01:39:27,480
IF YOU SAY SO.

1045
01:39:41,595 --> 01:39:43,029
WE LOST THEM.

1046
01:39:43,164 --> 01:39:44,965
WELL, NOT AT
THIS SPEED.

1047
01:39:45,099 --> 01:39:47,567
THEY MUST HAVE GONE
THE OTHER WAY.

1048
01:39:47,701 --> 01:39:49,669
YOU MEAN I DON'T KNOW
EVERYTHING AFTER ALL?

1049
01:39:49,804 --> 01:39:50,937
TURN AROUND.

1050
01:40:04,986 --> 01:40:07,020
"THIRTY-ISH,
BRUNETTE, DISHY".

1051
01:40:07,155 --> 01:40:09,089
WHAT WAS HER
NAME AGAIN?

1052
01:40:09,223 --> 01:40:10,891
TELFER.
LIANA TELFER.

1053
01:40:11,025 --> 01:40:12,525
NO, HER MAIDEN NAME.

1054
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:14,795
SAINT-MARTIN.

1055
01:40:14,929 --> 01:40:15,428
LOOK.

1056
01:40:57,872 --> 01:40:58,538
M'SIEUR?

1057
01:41:06,847 --> 01:41:08,415
THE CHATEAU,
I KNEW IT.

1058
01:41:13,754 --> 01:41:14,821
I SEE.

1059
01:41:31,339 --> 01:41:32,406
KEEP GOING.

1060
01:41:36,310 --> 01:41:37,411
KEEP GOING.

1061
01:43:40,401 --> 01:43:42,169
[conversation and laughter)

1062
01:43:55,550 --> 01:43:56,616
SEE THEM ANYWHERE?

1063
01:44:01,489 --> 01:44:02,155
NO.

1064
01:45:32,079 --> 01:45:33,446
SORRY TO INTRUDE
ON YOU LIKE THIS.

1065
01:45:33,581 --> 01:45:35,682
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1066
01:45:35,816 --> 01:45:37,350
I'VE JUST DROPPED BY...

1067
01:45:37,485 --> 01:45:39,286
TO PICK UP THE BOOK
YOU STOLE FROM MY ROOM.

1068
01:45:39,420 --> 01:45:40,820
THAT BOOK IS MINE.

1069
01:45:40,954 --> 01:45:42,455
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
ALL THIS BEFORE.

1070
01:45:42,590 --> 01:45:44,090
MY HUSBAND
GAVE IT TO ME!

1071
01:45:44,224 --> 01:45:47,193
IT WASN'T HIS TO SELL.

1072
01:45:47,328 --> 01:45:48,662
HE SOLD IT TO GET BACK AT YOU.
WHAT HAPPENED?

1073
01:45:48,796 --> 01:45:49,929
DID HE CATCH YOU
WITH THAT ALBINO?

1074
01:45:50,063 --> 01:45:51,030
HOW DARE YOU?

1075
01:45:51,165 --> 01:45:52,465
KEEP AN EYE ON HER.

1076
01:45:54,335 --> 01:45:55,402
DON'T!

1077
01:45:55,536 --> 01:45:57,870
BE CAREFUL.
SHE BITES.

1078
01:46:09,383 --> 01:46:10,383
HI.

1079
01:46:14,955 --> 01:46:16,323
DON'T MOVE.
EITHER ONE OF YOU.

1080
01:46:18,526 --> 01:46:19,492
GET THE BOOK.

1081
01:46:34,241 --> 01:46:36,075
DON'T KILL THEM
UP HERE...

1082
01:46:36,210 --> 01:46:38,144
YOU'LL MAKE A MESS.
TAKE THEM DOWNSTAIRS.

1083
01:46:40,013 --> 01:46:40,780
YOU, GO FIRST.

1084
01:46:40,914 --> 01:46:42,315
THEN YOU.

1085
01:46:55,529 --> 01:46:56,563
DOWN.

1086
01:47:11,879 --> 01:47:12,746
OPEN THE DOOR.

1087
01:47:25,826 --> 01:47:26,559
WATCH OUT!

1088
01:47:46,179 --> 01:47:47,146
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD IT IN YOU.

1089
01:47:51,518 --> 01:47:54,420
OCTO PORTAE ANTECEDUNT
SERPENTUM...

1090
01:47:54,554 --> 01:47:56,655
QUI VERBUM CUSTODIT.

1091

<i>TIBI DAMUS FIDELITATEM, DOMINE.
TIBI DEDEMUS...</i>

1092
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:04,330
<i>CORPORA ANIMOSQUE NOSTROS.</i>

1093
01:48:04,464 --> 01:48:07,934

1094
01:48:08,068 --> 01:48:10,536
BESTIA CUJOS OCULI...

01:48:10,670 --> 01:48:13,973
VIDENTUR IN SPECULO SCIENTIAE.

1096
01:48:18,045 --> 01:48:19,678
YOU STAY HERE
AND COVER ME.

1097
01:48:19,813 --> 01:48:21,914
I'M GOING DOWN.

1098
01:48:22,049 --> 01:48:24,984
NE TIMEAMUS NEC LAQUEUM...

01:48:25,118 --> 01:48:27,519

ET PESTILENTIA CONTAMINATOS.

1101
01:48:49,542 --> 01:48:53,012

MUMBO-JUMBO.

1105
01:49:08,996 --> 01:49:11,497
MUMBO-JUMBO!
MUMBO-JUMBO.

1106
01:49:18,805 --> 01:49:21,307
LOOK AROUND YOU, ALL OF YOU.
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

1107
01:49:21,441 --> 01:49:25,144
A BUNCH OF BUFFOONS,
IN FANCY DRESS.

1108
01:49:25,279 --> 01:49:27,846
DO YOU THINK THE PRINCE
OF DARKNESS WOULD ACTUALLY

1109
01:49:27,981 --> 01:49:30,049
DEIGN TO MANIFEST HIMSELF...
BEFORE THE LIKES OF YOU?

1110
01:49:30,183 --> 01:49:31,483
HE NEVER HAS,
AND HE NEVER WILL.

1111
01:49:31,618 --> 01:49:32,018
NEVER!

1112
01:49:34,254 --> 01:49:36,455
YOU READ FROM HIS BOOK...

1113
01:49:36,589 --> 01:49:39,825
BUT YOU HAVE NO CONCEPTION
OF ITS TRUE POWER.

1114
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:42,728
I, ALONE, HAVE GRASPED
ITS SECRET.

1115
01:49:42,862 --> 01:49:45,631
I, ALONE, HAVE FATHOMED
THE MASTER'S GRAND DESIGN.

1116
01:49:45,765 --> 01:49:48,067
I, ALONE, AM WORTHY
TO ENJOY THE FRUITS...

1117
01:49:48,201 --> 01:49:50,403
OF THAT DISCOVERY.

1118
01:49:50,537 --> 01:49:53,406
ABSOLUTE POWER...
TO DETERMINE MY OWN DESTINY.

1119
01:49:53,540 --> 01:49:55,574
YOU'RE INSANE, BORIS.
GIVE IT BACK TO ME.

1120
01:49:55,708 --> 01:49:58,978
YOU, LIANA DE
SAINT-MARTIN...

1121
01:49:59,112 --> 01:50:01,580
YOU'RE EVEN GUILTIER THAN THE
REST OF THIS PATHETIC RABBLE.

1122
01:50:01,714 --> 01:50:03,749
YOU HAVE AT LEAST
SOME IDEA...

1123
01:50:03,883 --> 01:50:05,818
OF WHAT THIS BOOK CAN DO
IN THE RIGHT HANDS.

1124
01:50:05,953 --> 01:50:08,254
YET, YOU LEND YOURSELF TO
THESE FARCICAL PROCEEDINGS...

1125
01:50:08,388 --> 01:50:11,090
THESE ORGIES
OF AGING FLESH...

1126
01:50:11,224 --> 01:50:12,691
CONDUCTED IN
THE MASTER'S NAME.

1127
01:50:12,826 --> 01:50:13,492
YOU'RE A CHARLATAN!

1128
01:50:41,754 --> 01:50:43,089
DON'T, CORSO!
DON'T!

1129
01:50:52,432 --> 01:50:54,000
LET IT BE.

1130
01:51:12,752 --> 01:51:13,352
BOO!

1131
01:51:27,534 --> 01:51:29,668
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU?

1132
01:51:29,802 --> 01:51:31,803
HE JUST MURDERED
SOMEONE IN PUBLIC.

1133
01:51:31,938 --> 01:51:33,839
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK...

1134
01:51:33,973 --> 01:51:36,042
FOR THE OTHER KILLINGS.
YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL.

1135
01:51:36,176 --> 01:51:38,444
I'M ECSTATIC!

1136
01:51:38,578 --> 01:51:39,778
YOU'RE OUT OF A JOB. IT'S OVER.
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?

1137
01:51:39,913 --> 01:51:40,446
YOU KNOW WHAT.

1138
01:52:07,574 --> 01:52:10,309
NOT TAKING ME
FOR A RIDE?

1139
01:52:10,444 --> 01:52:12,278
YOU WERE WORKING
FOR HIM ALL ALONG.

1140
01:52:12,412 --> 01:52:13,779
FUNNY, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE.

1141
01:53:00,660 --> 01:53:01,193
SHIT!

1142
01:54:46,899 --> 01:54:47,866
MADAME?

1143
01:57:12,178 --> 01:57:15,781
<i>YES... YES.</i>

1144
01:57:15,915 --> 01:57:17,850
<i>THAT'S IT.</i>

1145
01:57:17,984 --> 01:57:19,518
<i>PRECISELY.</i>

1146
01:57:21,454 --> 01:57:23,655
<i>ALL IS IN READINESS.</i>

1147
01:57:23,790 --> 01:57:25,491
<i>ONE.</i>

1148
01:57:25,625 --> 01:57:27,943
<i>FOUR.</i>

1149
01:57:28,077 --> 01:57:32,965
THREE, SIX, SEVEN...

1150
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:37,669
FIVE, EIGHT, TWO, NINE...

1151
01:57:40,173 --> 01:57:41,807
THE ENIGMA IS
SOLVED AT LAST.

1152
01:57:44,277 --> 01:57:46,846
TO TRAVEL IN SILENCE...

1153
01:57:46,980 --> 01:57:49,081
BY LONG AND
CIRCUITOUS ROUTE...

1154
01:57:49,216 --> 01:57:51,350
TO BRAVE THE ARROWS OF
MISFORTUNE...

1155
01:57:51,484 --> 01:57:53,685
AND FEAR NEITHER NOOSE,
NOR FIRE...

1156
01:57:53,820 --> 01:57:55,921
TO PLAY THE GREATEST
OF ALL GAMES...

1157
01:57:56,056 --> 01:57:58,457
AND WIN, FOREGOING
NO EXPENSE...

1158
01:57:58,591 --> 01:58:01,794
IS TO MOCK THE VICISSITUDES
OF FATE...

1159
01:58:01,928 --> 01:58:04,663
AND GAIN AT LAST THE KEY...
THAT WILL UNLOCK...

1160
01:58:04,798 --> 01:58:06,565
THE NINTH GATE.

1161
01:58:12,505 --> 01:58:14,573
CORSO!

1162
01:58:14,707 --> 01:58:16,742
WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING,
AN APPARITION?

1163
01:58:19,846 --> 01:58:22,782
YOU'RE NOT WANTED HERE,
MR. CORSO. LEAVE!

1164
01:58:22,916 --> 01:58:25,985
I'M THE ONLY APPARITION
YOU'LL SEE TONIGHT.

1165
01:58:26,119 --> 01:58:28,320
YOU'LL FIND A CHECK WAITING
AT MY NEW YORK OFFICE.

1166
01:58:28,454 --> 01:58:30,422
PAYMENT IN FULL.

1167
01:58:30,556 --> 01:58:31,991
YOU KILLED FOR THOSE.

1168
01:58:32,125 --> 01:58:33,759
THEY'RE WORTH MORE
THAN MONEY.

1169
01:58:33,894 --> 01:58:35,427
INFINITELY MORE.

1170
01:58:35,561 --> 01:58:37,529
BUT THEY HAPPEN
TO BE MINE.

1171
01:58:37,664 --> 01:58:39,631
NOT YOURS.

1172
01:58:39,766 --> 01:58:42,835
YOU KNOW
SOMETHING, CORSO?

1173
01:58:42,969 --> 01:58:45,470
IN SPITE OF
OUR DIFFERENCES...

1174
01:58:45,605 --> 01:58:48,207
I HAVE A SOFT SPOT
FOR YOU.

1175
01:58:48,341 --> 01:58:49,975
I'M TOUCHED.

1176
01:58:50,110 --> 01:58:52,678
WE HAVE SOMETHING
IN COMMON, YOU AND I.

1177
01:58:52,813 --> 01:58:55,281
WE SHARE THE SAME PASSION.

1178
01:58:55,415 --> 01:58:57,216
YOU'VE DEVELOPED THE SAME
OBSESSION, HAVEN'T YOU?

1179
01:58:57,350 --> 01:58:59,551
UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU...

1180
01:58:59,686 --> 01:59:02,054
ONLY ONE OF US IS
DESTINED TO FULFILL IT.

1181
01:59:02,189 --> 01:59:04,023
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR DEPTH.
KINDLY GO.

1182
01:59:04,157 --> 01:59:06,859
I'M NOT LEAVING HERE
EMPTY-HANDED.

1183
01:59:06,993 --> 01:59:08,360
DON'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT.

1184
01:59:10,130 --> 01:59:11,897
STAND ASIDE.

1185
01:59:12,032 --> 01:59:15,000
I CREDITED YOU
WITH MORE FINESSE.

1186
01:59:15,135 --> 01:59:16,869
YOU HEARD ME.
STAND BACK.

1187
01:59:17,003 --> 01:59:17,536
PUT THAT AWAY,
IT'S NOT YOUR STYLE.

1188
01:59:41,427 --> 01:59:43,462
IT SEEMS YOU'VE FOUND YOUR
PROPER NICHE AT LAST.

1189
01:59:43,596 --> 01:59:45,164
I LIKE THAT.

1190
01:59:46,299 --> 01:59:47,532
NOW...

1191
01:59:47,667 --> 01:59:48,934
YOU CAN WATCH.

1192
01:59:59,645 --> 02:00:02,915
I'M ENTERING
UNCHARTED TERRITORY...

1193
02:00:03,049 --> 02:00:05,384
TAKING THE ROAD
THAT LEADS TO EQUALITY...

1194
02:00:05,518 --> 02:00:07,119
WITH GOD.

1195
02:00:22,668 --> 02:00:24,703
YOU CAN'T COME WITH ME.

1196
02:00:24,837 --> 02:00:27,239
I MUST TRAVEL ALONE.

1197
02:00:27,374 --> 02:00:29,108
BUT YOU MAY LOOK ON...

1198
02:00:29,242 --> 02:00:30,309
AND MARVEL.

1199
02:00:30,443 --> 02:00:31,977
THAT'S VERY
KIND OF YOU.

1200
02:00:32,112 --> 02:00:33,745
INDEED IT IS.

1201
02:00:37,017 --> 02:00:40,185
THERE HAVE BEEN MEN WHO HAVE
BEEN BURNED ALIVE...

1202
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:43,655
OR DISEMBOWELED FOR
JUST A GLIMPSE...

1203
02:00:43,790 --> 02:00:47,492
OF WHAT YOU ARE
ABOUT TO WITNESS.

1204
02:00:56,469 --> 02:00:58,938
I GIVE YOU MY ALLEGIANCE,
MASTER.

1205
02:00:59,072 --> 02:01:02,408
I PLEDGE MYSELF TO YOU
BODY AND SOUL.

1206
02:01:02,542 --> 02:01:05,477
LET ME FEAR NEITHER NOOSE,
NOR FIRE, NOR POISON.

1207
02:01:05,611 --> 02:01:07,846
ERASE ME FROM
THE BOOK OF LIFE...

1208
02:01:07,981 --> 02:01:09,815
AND INSCRIBE ME IN
THE BLACK BOOK OF DEATH.

1209
02:01:09,950 --> 02:01:11,951
ADMIT ME...

1210
02:01:12,085 --> 02:01:14,186
TO THE NINTH GATE.
LET IT BE SO.

1211
02:01:18,325 --> 02:01:19,191
LET IT BE SO...
NOW!

1212
02:01:31,438 --> 02:01:32,571
YES.

1213
02:01:35,842 --> 02:01:37,776
I FEEL THE POWER
SURGE THROUGH ME...

1214
02:01:37,910 --> 02:01:39,979
LIKE AN ELECTRIC CURRENT...

1215
02:01:40,113 --> 02:01:43,015
RENDERING ME CAPABLE
OF ANY FEAT OF MIND OR BODY.

1216
02:01:43,149 --> 02:01:44,984
I'M INVULNERABLE!
I'M INVINCIBLE!

1217
02:01:48,821 --> 02:01:50,289
I CAN FLOAT ON AIR!

1218
02:01:50,423 --> 02:01:52,191
I CAN WALK ON WATER!

1219
02:01:56,997 --> 02:02:00,032
BEHOLD! I PLUNGE
MY HANDS IN FIRE.

1220
02:02:00,166 --> 02:02:02,734
I FEEL NO HEAT!

1221
02:02:02,869 --> 02:02:04,470
THAT'S JUST GREAT.
GIVE US ANOTHER ONE.

1222
02:02:16,549 --> 02:02:17,749
SIC DEDO ME.

1223
02:02:19,252 --> 02:02:21,620
SIC EXEO ME!

1224
02:02:21,754 --> 02:02:22,954
SIC DAMNO ME!

1225
02:02:24,824 --> 02:02:27,926
IT'S MIRACULOUS!

1226
02:02:28,061 --> 02:02:30,162
I FEEL NOTHING,
NOTHING AT ALL!

1227
02:05:40,687 --> 02:05:42,987
IS THAT IT?

1228
02:05:43,122 --> 02:05:45,224
IS THE GAME OVER?

1229
02:05:45,358 --> 02:05:48,993
FOR BALKAN, YES.
NOT FOR YOU.

1230
02:05:49,128 --> 02:05:50,795
WHY DIDN'T IT
WORK FOR BALKAN?

1231
02:05:50,930 --> 02:05:52,197
THE NINTH ENGRAVING
WAS A FORGERY.

1232
02:05:55,335 --> 02:05:57,436
WHERE'S THE REAL ONE?

1233
02:05:59,171 --> 02:06:00,239
I WANT IT.

1234
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:04,976
YOU'RE RUNNING
LOW ON GAS.

1235
02:07:37,870 --> 02:07:39,371
OIGA!

1236
02:07:39,505 --> 02:07:41,440
HERMANOS CENIZA?

1237
02:07:41,574 --> 02:07:42,741
COMO?

1238
02:07:42,875 --> 02:07:45,176
HERMANOS CENIZA?

1239
02:07:45,311 --> 02:07:48,814
PEPE LOPEZ.
RICARDO HERRERA.

1240
02:07:48,948 --> 02:07:52,250
SI...
DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH?
