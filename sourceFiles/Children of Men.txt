1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Children of Men

2
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,900
The Muslim community demands an end

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,300
The Homeland Security bill is ratified.

4
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,300
After eight years, British borders will remain closed.

5
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,400
The deportation of illegal immigrants will continue.

6
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,500
Good morning. Our lead story.

7
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,900
The world was stunned today by the death of Diego Ricardo,

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,300
the youngest person on the planet.

9
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,600
Baby Diego was stabbed outside a bar in Buenos Aires

10
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,300
after refusing to sign an autograph.

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,700
Witnesses at the scene say...

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,900
Excuse me.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,600
...that Diego spat in the face of a fan who asked for an autograph.

14
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,200
He was killed in the ensuing brawl. The fan was later beaten to death...

15
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,500
Coffee, please. Black.

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,000
...by the angry crowd.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,700
Born in 2009, the son of Marcello and Sylvia Ricardo,

18
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,600
a working- class couple from Mendoza,

19
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,100
he struggled all his life with the celebrity status

20
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,000
thrust upon him as the world's youngest person.

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,600
Diego Ricardo, the youngest person on the planet

22
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,600
was 18 years, 4 months,

23
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,700
20 days, 16 hours and 8 minutes old.

24
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,400
Throughout his life, Diego Ricardo was a tragic reminder

25
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,500
of the 18 years of infertility that humanity has endured

26
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,200
and its effect upon the world we now live in.

27
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,000
It seems that the mantle of the world's youngest human has passed to a woman.

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,500
She is 18 years, 5 months and 1 1 days old.

29
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,000
- Faron. - Mr. Griffiths.

30
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,000
I seem to be more affected by Baby Diego's death than I realized, sir.

31
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,600
If you wouldn't mind, I'd appreciate it if I could finish my day's work at home.

32
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,100
...generation needs to reject family and society.

33
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,700
He's my dentist. She's my house cleaner.

34
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,400
He's the waiter.  She's my cousin.

35
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,300
They are illegal immigrants.

36
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,600
To hire, feed or shelter illegal immigrants is a crime.

37
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,900
It's your life.

38
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,400
It's your choice.

39
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,900
Hey, amigo!

40
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,600
Jasper!

41
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,100
Good to see you. Come on.

42
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,700
You know who did it?

43
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,200
Islamic? Fishes? Fuck knows.

44
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,100
I'll bet it was the government.

45
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,100
Every time one of our politicians is in trouble, a bomb explodes.

46
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,500
It's the second time in a month.

47
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,600
- You okay? - It was horrible.

48
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,900
I'm glad you don't take cream or sugar, amigo.

49
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:36,300
Losing you and Baby Diego on the same day would be too hard to bear.

50
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,300
Well, that was even worse, everybody crying.

51
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,900
I mean, Baby Diego, come on. That guy was a wanker.

52
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,700
Yeah, but he was the youngest wanker on Earth.

53
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,300
Pull my finger. Quick, quick!

54
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,000
Jasper...

55
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,300
Fucking hell! That's disgusting!

56
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,900
Illegal immigrants. Taking them to Bexhill.

57
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,900
Poor fugees.

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
After escaping the worst atrocities and finally making it to England,

59
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,400
our government hunts them down like cockroaches.

60
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,100
- Any girls? - No.

61
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,800
What about the one we had lunch with? Lauren?

62
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,700
Lorna. That was ages ago.

63
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,800
- I liked her. What happened? - She decided to renounce.

64
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,800
Renouncers? Are those the ones that kneel down for a month for salvation?

65
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,600
No. They're the Repenters.

66
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,100
The Renouncers flagellate themselves for the forgiveness of humanity.

67
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,600
Oh, right.

68
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,700
Dating ain't what it used to be, is it, amigo?

69
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,200
- What'd you do on your birthday?  - Nothing.

70
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,100
Come on. You must've done something.

71
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,800
No. Same as every other day.

72
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,300
Woke up, felt like shit, went to work, felt like shit.

73
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
That's called a hangover, amigo.

74
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,200
At least with a hangover, I feel something.

75
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,300
Honestly, Jasper, sometimes...

76
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,400
You could always come and live with us.

77
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,900
Yeah, but if I did that, I wouldn't have anything to look forward to.

78
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,300
Look who it is. It's Theo.

79
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,100
- Hey, Janice, how you doing? - It's Theo.

80
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,700
Your rebel with a lost cause.

81
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
She loves this color.

82
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,200
Don't you, darling? You love it.

83
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,800
"Is there a chance it will not work for me?

84
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,800
"There have been no cases of anyone surviving

85
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,200
"who has taken the preparation."

86
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,000
Daddy government hands out suicide kits and anti- depressants in the rations,

87
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,300
but ganja is still illegal.

88
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,600
Most of my weed goes to Bexhill now.

89
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,500
This bloke buys it from me and smuggles it in.

90
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Guess what he does? His real job?

91
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,400
Immigration cop.

92
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,600
Bravo!

93
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,300
One of the many perks of having a refugee camp in the neighborhood.

94
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,900
Come on, taste that.

95
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,900
Cough.

96
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500
- Cough? - Cough.

97
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,600
You taste it? Strawberries.

98
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
This is Strawberry Cough.

99
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,700
So, Human Project is having this dinner

100
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,400
and all the wisest men in the world are there...

101
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,400
"Human Project." Why do people believe this crap?

102
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,400
You know, even if these people existed with these facilities in secret locations...

103
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,300
Fuck me, that's strong.

104
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,300
Even if they discovered the cure for infertility, it doesn't matter.

105
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,900
Too late. The world went to shit.

106
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,000
You know what?

107
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,800
It was too late before the infertility thing happened, for fuck's sake.

108
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,200
I was just trying to tell a joke, man.

109
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,600
I'm sorry. Go on.

110
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,500
- No, I'm not telling it now. - No, come on, Jasper.

111
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,100
- No. Fuck it. I'm not fucking telling you. - It's all right. Go on.

112
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,800
Okay. The Human Project gives this great big dinner

113
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,400
for all the scientists and sages in the world.

114
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,900
They're tossing around theories about the ultimate mystery,

115
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,500
why are women infertile? Why can't we make babies anymore?

116
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,700
Some of them say it's genetic experiments,

117
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,900
gamma rays, pollution. Same old, same old.

118
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,300
Anyway, in the corner, this Englishman's sitting.

119
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,500
He hasn't said a word. He's just tucking into his dinner.

120
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So they decide to ask him.

121
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,700
They say, "Well, why do you think we can't make babies anymore?"

122
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,400
And he looks up at them, and he's chewing on this great big wing,

123
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,400
and he says, "I haven't the faintest idea," he said.

124
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,500
"But this stork is quite tasty, isn't it?"

125
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,500
Eating a fucking stork.

126
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,600
Eating the stork.

127
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,900
Italia.

128
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,900
You okay, amigo?

129
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,900
Yeah. My ears are still ringing from earlier.

130
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,700
Well, a little Zen music won't bother you, then, will it?

131
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,800
WOGood morning. The time is 7ï¼š59 a.m.

132
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,000
British citizens, hold out

133
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,500
your I.D. cards. All others, follow instructions.

134
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,000
What the fuck?

135
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,300
Move along! Move along!

136
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,400
This is him.

137
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,600
- Get your fucking head down! - Walk!

138
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,700
- Get your fucking head down! - Okay. Okay.

139
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,100
Get in! Get him in! Get him in!

140
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Get his fucking legs.

141
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,900
Go, go, go, go!

142
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,500
You are under the jurisdiction of the Fishes.

143
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,500
The Fishes are at war with the British government

144
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,900
until they recognize equal rights for every immigrant in Britain.

145
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,400
We're not gonna hurt you. We just want to talk.

146
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,600
But don't do anything stupid.

147
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,300
JUL Uncover him.  It isn't safe.

148
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,200
Do it.

149
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,600
Hello, Theo.

150
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,500
It's me, Theo. It's Julian.

151
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,200
You scared the shit out of me.

152
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,200
I'm sorry about the theatrics, but we had no choice.

153
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,700
The police have been a pain in the ass lately.

154
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,300
How have you been?

155
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,100
Fantastic. Couldn't be better.

156
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,200
Cut the lights.

157
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,500
The police keep using that old photo of you in the posters.

158
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,800
It doesn't do you justice.

159
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,700
What do the police know about justice?

160
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,200
What exactly is it you guys do, anyway?

161
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,800
The Fishes fight for equal rights for every immigrant in Britain!

162
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
He knows what we do.

163
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,900
I know you almost blew me up in a coffee shop yesterday.

164
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,800
My ears are still ringing.

165
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,500
- We don't bomb. - That was the government.

166
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,600
That's what they do to spread the fear.

167
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,400
- What about Liverpool? - After Liverpool, we stopped bombing.

168
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,300
We started speaking to the people.

169
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,200
And they're joining us, Theo. British people, too.

170
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,900
I don't talk politics.

171
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,100
- That's all you ever used to do. - That was 20 years ago.

172
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,100
I'm a lot more successful now.

173
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,100
Come on, Theo. Walk with me.

174
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,700
-  I don't think that's a good idea. - Come on!

175
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,400
- You're smoking? - Yeah. It's not working.

176
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,600
I heard about your mother. I'm sorry.

177
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,300
Were your parents in New York when it happened?

178
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,200
- Yeah. - Shit.

179
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,100
Yeah, well, that's the world we live in now, isn't it?

180
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,900
Why am I here, Jules?

181
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,100
I need your help. I need transit papers.

182
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,700
Not for me. A girl, she's a fugee.

183
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Need to get her to the coast, past security checkpoints.

184
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,700
I haven't seen you for nearly 20 years and you come asking me for transit papers?

185
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,500
- Can you do it? - I don't see how.

186
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,100
You could ask your cousin.

187
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,000
The government finances his Ark of the Arts. He has access to papers.

188
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,700
- Yeah, but he'd never do it. - He would if you asked him.

189
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,400
I can't. It's too dangerous.

190
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,700
I can get you

191
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,200
What are you talking about?

192
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,200
- I don't fucking need your money. - Right. Sorry.

193
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,100
My mistake.

194
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,100
You know that ringing in your ears? That...

195
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,300
That's the sound of the ear cells dying. Like their swan song.

196
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,500
Once it's gone, you'll never hear that frequency again.

197
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Enjoy it while it lasts.

198
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,200
This never fucking happened,

199
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,500
so don't go telling tales, 'cause we'll be watching you.

200
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,000
At work, when you sleep,

201
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,600
when you have a piss, we'll be watching. All the fucking time.

202
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Jeez, your breath stinks.

203
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,900
- No, it doesn't. - Yes, it does.

204
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,500
It was Julian's idea bringing you here. She put herself at great risk.

205
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,800
Now you know about the five grand we can offer you.

206
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,100
So if you change your mind,

207
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,200
pin this to the notice board at Camden tube. We'll do the rest.

208
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Here you are. Bus fare.

209
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,100
Earthquakes! Pollution!

210
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,300
Disease and famine!

211
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,500
Our sins have encouraged God's wrath!

212
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,100
And in his anger he has taken away his most precious gift to us!

213
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,600
Mr. Faron, the minister is expecting you. This way, sir.

214
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm afraid this is a non- smoking facility.

215
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,100
You got something in your teeth.

216
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,200
If you'll excuse me.

217
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Couldn't save La Pieta. Smashed up before we got there.

218
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,000
Pretty rummy, huh?

219
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,700
My mom had a plastic one in the bathroom.

220
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,600
It was a lamp.

221
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Good to see you, Theo.

222
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,500
We got to keep Las Meninas and a few other Velasquezes,

223
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,100
but we only got a hold of two Goyas.

224
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,300
That thing in Madrid was a real blow to art.

225
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,800
Not to mention people.

226
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,200
How's Martha?

227
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,600
She's doing her animal charity thing. Sends her love.

228
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,100
- Give her my best. - Yes.

229
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,800
Why did you come, Theo?

230
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,300
Well, the thing is,

231
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,300
I met this girl.

232
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,800
Cute?

233
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,200
Beautiful.

234
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,100
Is it serious?

235
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,900
Very.

236
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,800
She's got this brother in Brighton and she hasn't seen him for about five years,

237
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
and he's not doing too good.

238
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,300
I mean, pretty sick.

239
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,800
- I don't think he's gonna make it. - Sorry.

240
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,500
I've got money. I was just hoping that you might...

241
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,200
I was hoping you could get us the transit papers to get to the coast.

242
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,200
- Transit papers? That's quite a favor. - I know.

243
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,900
Highly controlled.

244
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,100
Alex, take your pills.

245
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,000
Alex.

246
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,300
Alex?

247
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,100
Alex!

248
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,300
Come with me.

249
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,100
I'm really sorry, Nigel. I just don't know who else to ask.

250
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,000
I'll see what I can do.

251
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,100
What?

252
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,100
You kill me.

253
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,000
A hundred years from now,

254
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,000
there won't be one sad fuck to look at any of this.

255
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,100
What keeps you going?

256
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,700
You know what it is, Theo?

257
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,000
I just don't think about it.

258
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,600
Where's Julian? She couldn't make it. Sends her best.

259
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,600
Here's a photo of the girl and her name.

260
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,000
Hang on. We got a problem.

261
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,000
All I could get were joint transit papers, which means I would have to escort the girl.

262
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,300
Will you?

263
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,700
For a couple more grand.

264
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Julian thinks very highly of you.

265
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,000
Does she?

266
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,200
Yeah.

267
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,200
Thanks again.

268
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,900
Go on, stay with her.

269
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,700
Stay with her. Stay with her. Yes!

270
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,100
Have you seen this dog?

271
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,600
I'll be one minute.

272
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,500
Billy! I'm in a rush, mate.

273
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,800
Okay, Theo. He'll see to you. He'll see to you.

274
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,100
I'm in a rush. Come on. Come on.

275
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,700
That's 70 quid.

276
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,600
Shit.

277
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,400
She's my house cleaner.  He's the plumber.

278
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,500
Jesus.

279
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,600
He's my dentist. He's the waiter.

280
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,600
She's my cousin.

281
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,900
They are illegal immigrants.

282
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,400
To hire, feed or shelter illegal immigrants is a crime.

283
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Protect Britain.

284
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,400
Report all illegal immigrants.

285
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,000
Did you get the papers?

286
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Lovely to see you, too.

287
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,100
Thank you. I really appreciate this.

288
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,300
Just like the old days, back of the bus.

289
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,900
Yeah, except we're the old farts now.

290
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,400
- You're looking good. - Right.

291
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
Seriously. Look at me.

292
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,200
It's hard for me to look at you.

293
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,200
He had your eyes.

294
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,400
You know, I never understood how you got over it so quickly.

295
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,900
You think I got over it?

296
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,200
No one could get over it. I live with it. I think about him every day.

297
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,600
Come on, I mean the way you just...

298
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,600
You don't have a monopoly on suffering, you know.

299
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,100
You always carried his memory like a ball and chain...

300
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,500
What do you fucking know about my memories?

301
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,300
- You don't know what I feel or what... - Move!

302
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,400
Yeah, there you go.

303
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,300
That's what you always do. When it gets tough, you walk away.

304
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
This is our stop.

305
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,400
JUL Thelonius!

306
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,300
So why did you come to me?

307
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,600
You could have found other ways to get transit papers.

308
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,000
Probably.

309
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,400
- So why me? - I trust you.

310
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,300
- And what happens after? - You take a train back. It'll be safer.

311
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,800
No, I mean what happens to us?

312
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,500
I don't know.

313
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,600
Theo, come on. You came for the money.

314
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,600
Did I?

315
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,900
Theo?

316
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,200
- You got my money? - See?

317
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,600
We'll take you down to the first checkpoint on the Canterbury Road,

318
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,800
then you and Kee are on your own.

319
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,400
Well, this is obviously the elite unit.

320
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,800
- This is Miriam. - Hi.

321
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,200
- Is this the girl? - JUL Kee, this is Theo.

322
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,300
What the fuck you staring at?

323
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,800
Apparently the pleasure's all mine.

324
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,300
Are we planning a sing- along?

325
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,100
Good. I'm gonna take a nap.

326
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,500
The afternoon is looking good here on Radio Avalon.

327
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,100
And now one for all the nostalgics out there,

328
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,400
a blast from the past all the way back from 2003.

329
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,200
That beautiful time when people refused to accept

330
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,800
the future was just around the corner.

331
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,100
Hey.

332
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,000
You're snoring.

333
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,700
- No, I wasn't. - Yes, you were. He always snored.

334
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,400
Where are we?

335
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,000
Canterbury. We're close.

336
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,700
Anyone know if there's a hotel around here?

337
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,200
What?

338
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,000
Julian promised me a little bit of action.

339
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,400
You still like it in the afternoon?

340
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,200
So what did you do? Rob a train? Blow up a building?

341
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,000
Leave the girl alone.

342
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,100
You told me he was suave. Wanker's a drunk.

343
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,000
He's suave. You should have seen him in the old days when he was a real activist.

344
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,400
You were the activist, I just wanted to get laid.

345
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,200
One time the police came to throw us out of our squat

346
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,600
and Theo invited them up for coffee to negotiate,

347
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,800
only the coffee was spiked with ketamine.

348
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,300
No! You didn't, did you?

349
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,100
Fuck off. You gotta be kidding.

350
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,700
You know how many people I've tried this with?

351
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
I don't wanna know.

352
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,000
You'll be happy to know out of the hundreds...

353
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,700
- Hundreds? - ...you are still the only one.

354
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,000
- I'm not doing it. - Yes, you are.

355
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,600
- No, I'm not. The car's moving too much. - Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

356
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,600
You are. Ready?

357
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,500
Thelonius!

358
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,200
No, wait, wait. Okay.

359
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,900
Do it again! Do it again!

360
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,300
Julian, that's disgusting!

361
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,400
Look out!

362
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,900
Jesus! Shit!

363
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,300
JUL Go! Go! We're gonna make it. Come on, we're gonna make it.

364
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,400
No, I'm not gonna make it! I'm not gonna make it!

365
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,200
- Christ! - Back up! Back up now!

366
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,000
Jesus!

367
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,000
Oh, save us! Save us in our hour of need!

368
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,000
Blessed Mary, save us.

369
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,400
Christ, Jesus!

370
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,100
- He's got a gun! - Cover Kee!

371
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,800
Get down!

372
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,700
Oh, my God!

373
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,100
She's been shot! Fuck. She's been shot.

374
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,100
- How is she? How is she? - She's bleeding!

375
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,300
She's bleeding, she's bleeding everywhere!

376
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,100
Shit! Julian.

377
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,200
Put pressure on the wound!

378
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,000
Please, please, please.

379
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,700
Please, please.

380
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,400
Oh, no.

381
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,700
Oh, no.

382
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,500
Julian...

383
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,300
Jesus Christ!

384
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,600
Julian!

385
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,900
It's the cops. It's the cops.

386
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,700
Did they see us?

387
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,300
Keep going. Speed up.

388
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Are they coming back? What's happening?

389
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,300
- Are they coming back? - I don't know. Just go faster!

390
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,800
Can't you pull off the road?

391
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,900
- All right, slow down. Slow down! - I can't outrun them. I can't outrun them.

392
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,500
-  Stop the car. - I gotta stop. I gotta stop.

393
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,200
Pull over to the side of the road. Stop the car!

394
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,200
Get your passports out!

395
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Stay inside the vehicle!

396
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,200
We're British citizens! We're British citizens!

397
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,100
- British citizens! - Hands on the steering wheel!

398
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,800
Hands on the steering wheel! Calm down. Tell me what happened!

399
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,800
We were attacked! We gotta take her to a hospital.

400
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,200
Okay. Just wait. I'm gonna call for assistance.

401
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,100
What are you doing? What are you doing?

402
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,600
- Get in the car. - Why did you do that?

403
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,700
Get in the fucking car!

404
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,700
Get back in now. Quickly. We gotta get off the road. Get in. Get in.

405
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,900
Go! Go! Go!

406
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,300
We have to call on help now. Put your hands out.

407
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,900
Fucking shit.

408
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,200
May all the ascended beings, the bodhisattvas and saints

409
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,600
and all those who have walked the surface of the earth in the light of eternal truth,

410
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,500
come to the aid of our beloved sister, Julian.

411
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,900
Theo! Come on!

412
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,000
Theo, come on!

413
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,500
This is Tomasz and Emily's farm. I already called and told them the situation.

414
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,800
We'll be safe here.

415
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,600
Fishes are coming in to vote for a new leader.

416
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,600
- lan? - Yeah.

417
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,500
- We have to convene. - Everyone's arriving.

418
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,700
- Are you all right? - Yeah, it's not my blood.

419
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,200
- Emily, Tomasz, this is Kee. - Welcome.

420
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,500
Miriam.

421
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500
They need to wash up and rest.

422
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,300
How about Julian's mate?

423
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,600
Yeah, can somebody give me a lift back to London?

424
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,700
No, no, no. It's too dangerous. We'll sort it tomorrow.

425
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,700
Tomasz, get him a shower and a clean shirt.

426
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,300
Tomasz, don't block the car in. It needs to be jump- started. lan?

427
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,800
Yeah.

428
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,200
They like you. And they don't like anyone.

429
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,100
You did what you could. We need to show strength and unity.

430
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,100
- The shirt fit? - Yeah, it's fine. Thanks.

431
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,700
I'll take care of this.

432
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,100
As head Fishes, we need to make a choice now.

433
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,400
We need to choose leadership.

434
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,500
I don't think that those bloodstains will wash off.

435
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,400
Don't worry about it. Throw it away.

436
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,200
- I'm in charge of watching you. - Why?

437
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,500
They told me.

438
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,700
Well, I'm going back to London tomorrow.

439
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,200
I lived there once. Didn't like it.

440
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,200
No.

441
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,800
They kill you.

442
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,100
- Where you from? - Poland.

443
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,300
Is this your place?

444
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,900
My missus. She's a cod.

445
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,300
- English Fish. -  Mr. Faron.

446
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:44,300
Kee would like a word with you. She's in the barn. It's all right, Tomasz.

447
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,600
I'll watch him.

448
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Hey, don't smoke in the barn.

449
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,200
To Luke, our new leader. Luke.

450
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,200
- To Luke. - Luke.

451
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,300
I'll be right outside.

452
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,300
You know what they do to these cows? They cut off their tits. They do.

453
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,500
Gone. Bye.

454
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,800
Only leave four. Four tits fits the machine.

455
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,200
It's wacko. Why not make machines that suck eight titties?

456
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,200
Is that what you want to talk about? Cows and titties?

457
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,500
Julian told me about your baby.

458
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,600
Said his name was Dylan.

459
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,900
You taught him to swim when he was two. He called you "Papa."

460
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,800
She said if anything goes spooky, I should talk to you.

461
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,800
Said you'd help me, said you'd get me to the boat.

462
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,700
- What boat? - The Tomorrow.

463
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,500
The Tomorrow?

464
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

465
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,400
But I'm sure your friends can take care of you.

466
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,700
But Julian said only trust you.

467
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,700
She said you'd help me.

468
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,000
I don't know why she said that.

469
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,100
Listen, I don't quite know what's going on.

470
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,700
- You can't leave. - Kee, I'm in a lot of trouble myself.

471
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,700
- I'm sorry. - Wait!

472
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,000
What are you doing? Don't do that.

473
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,200
I'm scared.

474
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,300
Please help me.

475
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,300
Jesus Christ.

476
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,900
Kee! Kee!  What are you doing?

477
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,300
- Are you all right? - She wanted him to know. She has the right.

478
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,700
Of course she has.

479
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,000
For God's sake.

480
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,900
When you're ready, come inside. Everybody's arrived.

481
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,200
- She's pregnant. - Now you know what's at stake.

482
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,800
- But she's pregnant. - Yeah, I know.

483
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,700
It's a miracle, isn't it?

484
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,300
Fishes terrorist leader Julian Taylor was killed today

485
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,400
in a gun battle with police near Canterbury.

486
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,400
Four other terrorists escaped after murdering two officers.

487
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,000
Police say they have sufficient forensic and surveillance evidence

488
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,000
to identify the four killers.

489
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,200
All suspects should be considered armed and extremely dangerous.

490
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,200
This was broadcast an hour ago.

491
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,100
We have to assume it's just a matter of time before they identify the rest of us,

492
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,300
which includes you, Theo.

493
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,100
WO Why is he here?  He's not a Fish.

494
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,100
- He's not one of us. - I want him here.

495
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,000
Kee wants him, he stays.

496
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,600
Now, we all agreed to deliver Kee to our brothers and sisters in the Human Project.

497
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,900
-  Right. - Now we got to reevaluate that position.

498
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,300
No, there's no need. We move forward with the original plan.

499
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,500
Yes!

500
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,700
She'll never make it. The police are looking for her.

501
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,100
We can find a way. It's what Julian wanted.

502
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,600
We'd be risking the girl's life.

503
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,200
Listen, listen! She belongs here.

504
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,300
And this baby is the flag that could unite us all!

505
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,800
We said we'd never use this baby for political purposes.

506
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,100
My baby's not a flag.

507
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,900
Make it public!

508
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,400
What?

509
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,700
- What? - What?

510
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,400
Excuse me?

511
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,100
You should make it public.

512
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,200
You saw the telly. She's about to be very public.

513
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,600
It doesn't matter. She's pregnant.

514
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:46,500
Oh, right. And then the government will say, "We were wrong. Fugees are humans, too."

515
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,700
Well, whatever is going on,

516
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,900
whatever your political ideas are, it's irrelevant.

517
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,400
- It doesn't matter. - WO Come on.

518
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,300
- She needs a doctor. -  You really don't get it.

519
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,500
Look, the government will take her baby

520
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,500
and parade a posh black English lady as the mother.

521
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
- And she'll never see it again. - Nobody's taking my baby!

522
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,700
We all know this government would never acknowledge

523
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,800
the first human birth in 18 years from a fugee.

524
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,000
A wanted fugee.

525
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,200
Why don't we explain to Mr. Faron what they do to immigrants in this country?

526
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,200
He knows. He's seen the cages. He's not that stupid.

527
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,900
I'm not going to the government.

528
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,900
You told me you would get me to the Human Project.

529
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,500
- You promised me. - I know.

530
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,500
And we will.

531
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,500
But I don't think it's safe to try and reach the coast now.

532
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,300
You could stay here, Kee.

533
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,400
It's a safe place for you to have your child.

534
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,400
And when you and the baby are well enough,

535
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,700
we will find a way to get you to the Human Project.

536
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,800
I promise you, Kee.

537
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,000
It could take months to get back in touch with them again.

538
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,600
This is true. We have to take it under consideration.

539
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,900
Kee, this is your decision.

540
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,000
What do you think?

541
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,200
She has proper care!

542
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,700
- What the fuck does he know? - Hang on. Kee?

543
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,700
Kee, this is your choice.

544
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,400
- I have my baby here... - Yes!

545
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,900
...then you get me to the Human Project.

546
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Thank you, Kee. Thank you.

547
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,500
We need to organize safe houses. No more than three days in one place.

548
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,600
- No, no, you can't keep moving her around. - It's for her safety.

549
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,400
Please help him!  What are you doing?

550
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,400
- He's hurt really badly! - Oh, shit, fuck.

551
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,700
- I didn't have anywhere else to go. - You're not supposed to be here!

552
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,900
There's fucking police everywhere!

553
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,400
- What do you think you're doing? - He's been bleeding for hours!

554
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,200
Shut up! Get his bike out of here. Get it out!

555
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,600
What was I supposed to do?

556
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,800
It's a simple fucking plan. Get in here, Patric!

557
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,400
What the fuck are you doing here? What the fuck are you doing here?

558
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
No fucking excuses!

559
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,300
You have a first aid kit? Medicine?  Mostly for cows.

560
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,400
Iodine, bandages, clean towels, whatever you have, bring it to the barn.

561
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,200
And for God's sake, hide the fucking motorcycle.

562
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,700
You put everything at risk. What was I supposed to do?

563
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,200
What about all the fucking police, lan? You said it would be safe!

564
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,800
We paid the gang. We had no idea about the cops.

565
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,500
You broke the protocol. What were you thinking?

566
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,900
What was I thinking?

567
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,200
You could be responsible for putting the Uprising in jeopardy.

568
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,600
He needs a proper doctor!

569
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,100
Don't you get it?

570
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,300
We have a baby.

571
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,700
When people see we have a baby, everyone will join us in the Uprising.

572
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,100
But we can forget about the baby

573
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,200
if the girl even suspects we killed Julian!

574
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,600
What was I supposed to do?

575
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,300
You saw how he is. He's on death's fucking door!

576
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,800
- Take it easy. - You broke protocol.

577
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,400
He's my fucking cousin!

578
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,200
Luke, he needs a doctor.

579
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,600
Don't worry. We'll take care of him. Simon, right?

580
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,100
- Aye, Simon. - All right, sit down, Patric.

581
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,400
Simon is a good Fish. So are you.

582
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,000
Be proud to know that because of the two of you, the Uprising is assured.

583
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,200
The baby will stay with us.

584
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,600
Where's Faron? He's a fucking dead man.

585
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,400
No. Tomorrow. We'll do him then, after we move the girl.

586
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:31,100
Patric, you ever break protocol again,

587
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,500
I'll have to kill you.

588
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,700
Kee. Kee, it's Theo.

589
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,400
- Listen to me. - What's going on?

590
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:54,500
Luke killed Julian. They want your baby. They killed Julian.

591
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,500
They're gonna... They killed Julian. They're gonna kill me.

592
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,300
We have to leave. We have to go now.

593
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,100
Miriam, shut up!

594
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,300
Trust me, we've got to go.

595
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,800
Stop it! Stop it! Both of you!

596
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,600
Get off!

597
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,300
I'm going with him. Miriam, you can stay if you want.

598
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,000
Miriam, you have to keep your mouth shut.

599
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,300
- I mean it. - All right. All right.

600
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,700
We're moving the girl to Bristol straight away.

601
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,400
We need to bring weapons over...

602
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,100
The refugee camps...

603
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,300
Zaphyr, he looks bloody fucking awful.

604
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,600
All that dirt and sand in there, nowhere to hide the blood in, no skin.

605
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,200
Shit! It's fucking disgusting.

606
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,400
He's not gonna make it.

607
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,100
Of course not gonna make it, with all the blood and guts coming out.

608
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,000
Hey, Samir.

609
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,200
Shit.

610
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,100
Stop! Stop the car! Stop the fucking car!

611
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,100
Don't shoot!

612
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,200
Don't shoot! The girl's in the car!

613
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,100
- Stop! - The girl's in the car!

614
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,000
Stop the fucking car! Give me the fucking keys.

615
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,900
Give me the fucking keys.

616
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,600
Get down! Get down!

617
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,100
Can't you get it moving any faster? For God's sake!

618
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,600
Come on. Come on.

619
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,100
Stop!

620
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,900
Shit.

621
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,600
They're coming! They're coming!

622
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,200
Get going, get going! They're getting closer!

623
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,100
Oh, God! He's gaining on us!

624
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Can I shoot? I got a clean shot!

625
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,200
Fuck off!

626
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,500
Miriam, jump- start the car!

627
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,300
We have to go!

628
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,300
Wait till it gets faster!

629
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,900
All right! All right! Just push, you push!

630
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,200
Fucking hell!

631
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,800
Miriam! Miriam!

632
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,300
We have to wait for him! Theo!

633
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,900
Go, go, go!

634
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,700
Kee, are you all right? - I'm fine.

635
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,000
We need to find a safe house.

636
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,300
- Yeah, the last one was really fucking safe. - Well, what do you suggest?

637
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,900
Don't worry. I know where to go.

638
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,000
Wait here.

639
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,400
Oh, fuck.

640
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,300
Fuck.

641
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,500
Jasper?

642
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,600
Janice?

643
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,300
Jasper?

644
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,400
- Oh, fuck! - Oh, fuck you.

645
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,400
What are you doing with this shit?

646
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,700
This? I mix it with bread to poison the rats.

647
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:34,100
It's not bullshit what they say. They pass away quite peacefully.

648
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,200
Jasper.

649
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,500
Meet Miriam and Kee.

650
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:53,400
The Tomorrow is a hospital ship disguised as a fishing boat.

651
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,000
They'll take us to the Human Project.

652
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,300
I told you, amigo, the Human Project is real.

653
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,700
Yeah, but you're also the guy that believes in UFOs.

654
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,500
Tell them about that thing you saw on the heath.

655
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,500
You saw a UFO?

656
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,100
Did you know that the Human Project

657
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,200
is supposed to have a community on the Azores?

658
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,200
It's a sanctuary. That's where they'll take us, Kee.

659
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,100
Can you catch this ship anywhere else?

660
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:21,300
It's going to stop at the last two weather buoys en route at sunset.

661
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,300
So it will be tonight at Windsmore and then two night's time at Bexhill.

662
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,500
You can forget about Windsmore. We'd never make it in time.

663
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,500
No, it's our only chance. We can't get to Bexhill.

664
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,900
That's a refugee camp.

665
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,900
Eureka! Eat and rest.

666
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,500
With a little bit of luck, you're going to need all your energy.

667
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,500
- Where are you going? - Feed her for me, Theo.

668
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,400
Kee, your baby is the miracle

669
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,900
the whole world has been waiting for.

670
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,000
Come on. Come on.

671
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,600
Did he really see a UFO?

672
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,700
Is she doing her voodoo hoodoo?

673
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,700
She's doing something.

674
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,300
She smited me with that. Said it was good for my baby.

675
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,800
Does she look posh to you, or gawky?

676
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,000
Earnest.

677
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,600
Yeah.

678
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:05,100
- How many months? - Eight.

679
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,200
It takes nine months.

680
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,900
I know.

681
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,200
Who's the father?

682
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,600
Whiffet. I'm a virgin.

683
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,400
Sorry?

684
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,300
That'd be wicked, eh?

685
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,700
Yeah, it would.

686
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,300
Fuck knows. I don't know most of the wankers' names.

687
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,600
You know, when I started puking, I thought I catch the pest.

688
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,200
But then my belly started getting big.

689
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:40,000
Nobody ever told me these things. I never seen a pregnant woman before.

690
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,000
But I knew.

691
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,300
I felt like a freak.

692
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,700
I didn't tell nobody.

693
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,100
I thought about the Quietus thing. Supposed to be suave.

694
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,300
Pretty music and all that.

695
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,100
Then the baby kicked.

696
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:04,000
I feel it. Little bastard was alive. And I feel it. And me, too.

697
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,100
I am alive.

698
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,900
- Froley. - Froley.

699
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Name my baby Froley.

700
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,100
It's the first baby in 18 years.

701
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,900
- You can't call it Froley. - Says who?

702
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,100
Kee, I've found you a boat.

703
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,400
- Great. - How?

704
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,800
We get ourselves arrested.

705
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,700
- Oh, Jesus. - No, no.

706
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,800
Syd, this border guard I sell pot to, has agreed to get us into Bexhill.

707
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Nicely ironic, eh? We break into prison!

708
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,300
Wicked.

709
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,600
"Froley."

710
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,000
Come on.

711
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:31,600
Everything is a mythical cosmic battle

712
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:35,100
between faith and chance.

713
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:39,400
-  Maybe I shouldn't. - You already did. Take another one.

714
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,500
Now cough.

715
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,100
- What do you taste? - Strawberries.

716
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,600
Strawberries? That's what it's called. Strawberry Cough.

717
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,600
Wicked.

718
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:58,100
So, you've got faith over here, right, and chance over there.

719
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,200
- Like yin and yang. - Sort of.

720
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,900
Or Shiva and Shakti.

721
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,900
Lennon and McCartney.

722
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,800
Look, Julian and Theo.

723
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:10,300
Yeah, there you go. Julian and Theo met among a million protestors in a rally

724
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,600
by chance.

725
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,500
But they were there because of what they believed in

726
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:18,000
in the first place, their faith. They wanted to change the world.

727
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,900
And their faith kept them together.

728
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,600
But by chance, Dylan was born.

729
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,500
This is him?

730
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:31,100
Yeah, that's him. He would have been about your age. Magical child.

731
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,800
Beautiful.

732
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,700
- Their faith put in praxis. - Praxis?

733
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,000
- What happened? - Chance.

734
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,400
He was their sweet little dream.

735
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,700
He had little hands, little legs, little feet.

736
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,000
Little lungs.

737
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:53,200
And in 2008, along came the flu pandemic.

738
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,200
And then, by chance,

739
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,100
- he was gone. - Oh, Jesus.

740
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,600
You see, Theo's faith

741
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,400
lost out to chance.

742
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,400
So,

743
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,300
why bother if life's going to make its own choices?

744
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,400
- Watcha! Baby's got Theo's eyes. -  Yeah.

745
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,900
Oh, boy. That's terrible.

746
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:23,600
But, you know, everything happens for a reason.

747
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,100
That I don't know.

748
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,600
But Theo and Julian would always bring Dylan. He loved it here.

749
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,300
It's the alarm! Someone's breaking in!

750
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,100
What is it?

751
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,800
Look at this.

752
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,300
Shit.

753
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,200
Jasper, hurry up!

754
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,800
Where's Janice?

755
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,300
Take the back path to the main road, then follow the map I've given Miriam.

756
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,500
- Yeah, I've got it. - What are you talking about?

757
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,800
Wait for Syd at the old school on Watchbell Road in Rye.

758
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,300
Give him this, and tell him he's a fascist pig.

759
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,000
- We need to get Janice. - We're not going, Theo.

760
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:24,500
- What are you talking about? - You don't need an anchor.

761
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,300
- No, Jasper. You're coming. - You need time. We'll stall them.

762
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,100
I'll send them the wrong way. It's the best idea. Go on. Go on.

763
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,700
Jasper.

764
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,800
Theo, I've talked my way out of worse things than this. Believe me.

765
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,700
Go on. Go.

766
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,600
And remember, tell Syd he's a fascist pig.

767
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,100
I love you.

768
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,500
Hey, amigos!

769
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,200
We're looking for Theo Faron.

770
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,900
We know he was here a few weeks ago. Has he been back?

771
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,800
- Who? - Theo Faron.

772
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:28,400
I haven't seen him in weeks.

773
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,200
There's biscuits and coffee on inside! Help yourself.

774
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:35,200
You want a drag? Come on, have a drag. Lighten up.

775
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,700
What we got? Here, Luke.

776
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,500
There's a dead woman and dog inside.

777
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,500
They're going to Bexhill.

778
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,100
When did they leave?

779
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,100
When did they leave?

780
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,500
Pull my finger, go on.

781
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,500
Pull my finger.

782
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,000
I'll do it.

783
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,800
Fuck you.

784
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,400
Pull my finger.

785
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:28,000
- Theo, I'm so sorry. - Don't you fucking touch me.

786
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,400
You tell me the fucking reason in that.

787
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,900
- It's all part of a bigger thing. - Shut up!

788
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,200
Shut up and get in the fucking car.

789
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,800
- Jasper? - He's fine.

790
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,400
Everything's fine.

791
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:51,500
I was 31 . Midwife at the John Radcliffe.

792
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:54,300
I was doing a stint in the antenatal clinic.

793
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,400
Three of my patients miscarried in one week.

794
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:04,100
Others were in their fifth and sixth month. We managed to save two of the poor babies.

795
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,600
Next week, five more miscarried.

796
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,900
Then the miscarriages started happening earlier.

797
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,900
I remember booking a woman in for her next appointment

798
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,700
and noticing that the page seven months ahead was completely blank.

799
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,800
Not a single name.

800
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:24,000
I rang a friend who was working at Queen Charlotte's,

801
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,600
and she had no new pregnancies, either.

802
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:30,900
She then rang her sister in Sydney.

803
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,200
And it was the same thing there.

804
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,200
You can relax. She's finished.

805
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,300
As the sound of the playgrounds faded,

806
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,100
the despair set in.

807
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:58,900
Very odd what happens in a world without children's voices.

808
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,500
I was there at the end.

809
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:07,500
Now you're gonna be there at the beginning.

810
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:09,700
Yeah.

811
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,900
I'll be there at the beginning.

812
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,800
Thank you.

813
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,400
Kee, come on! We've got to go!

814
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,800
Stop where you are.

815
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:36,100
I'm looking for Syd.

816
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,700
Hands above your head.

817
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,300
You're a fascist pig.

818
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,700
What did you say?

819
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:03,200
I was told to tell you you're a fascist pig.

820
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,800
- Say it again. - No, don't, please!

821
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,200
Say it again.

822
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,200
Say it!

823
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,000
You're a fascist pig.

824
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,400
Come on.

825
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:38,000
It was Jasper's idea, you know. The whole password thing.

826
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,000
He will piss himself laughing when I tell him about this.

827
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,800
He's a cheeky old bastard.

828
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,400
So proud of his weed.

829
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:52,400
Syd could get it a lot cheaper from the gangs, but Syd likes to deal with Jasper.

830
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,700
Jasper's straight. A true gentleman.

831
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,600
- All right. - What's wrong with her? Is she sick?

832
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,300
Just carsick.

833
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,500
- She's not going to puke, is she? - No. She's fine.

834
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,500
Puking's bad. Very, very bad.

835
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:08,800
It doesn't wash out. The smell never goes away.

836
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Usually, there's people trying to get out of Bexhill, not in.

837
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:18,100
Syd doesn't know why you want to get in.

838
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,200
Syd doesn't want to know.

839
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,900
Syd doesn't care.

840
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,400
Just breathe. Just breathe.

841
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:29,500
What's wrong with her?

842
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,400
A minor contraction. It's normal. Just breathe.

843
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,600
All right.

844
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,900
When you're released, stroll out with the other fugees.

845
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,700
Look for the statue of a soldier.

846
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:42,200
There you'll meet a woman, Marichka. Arab, gypsy, something.

847
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,500
Always carries a shitty little dog with her.

848
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,900
She'll find you accommodation for tonight.

849
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,500
All right. You're fugees now.

850
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,800
Show Syd the fugee face.

851
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,500
Sad face.

852
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,400
Sad fugee face.

853
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
That's good. That's good.

854
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,500
Okay. Out!

855
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,000
Come on. Come on. Come on.

856
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,600
Hurry up. Hurry up, move.

857
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:32,600
Send me a postcard.

858
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,800
Seats in the back! Come on, hurry up!

859
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,000
What time are we supposed to meet the boat?

860
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,600
Sunset tomorrow.

861
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:27,900
How do we know that Luke and his mob haven't intercepted it?

862
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:32,600
Luke has no way of contacting the Human Project. Nor does anyone else.

863
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,300
Say again?

864
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:41,300
Contact with the Human Project is done by mirrors.

865
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,500
Julian was our mirror.

866
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:46,900
What do you mean, "mirrors"?

867
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Mirrors. They contact one of our people.

868
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,600
That person contacts someone else, and so on, till word gets to Julian.

869
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:55,900
She tells Luke.

870
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,400
You mean you never actually talked to any of them?

871
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:02,000
Don't fucking tell me you never actually talked to them?

872
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,800
- Breathe it out. - Is she okay?

873
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,100
That's it. Breathe it out, breathe it out.

874
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I can't fucking breathe.

875
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,500
You sure this is normal?

876
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,900
It shouldn't be this frequent.

877
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,900
Come on, breathe it out. All right, all right.

878
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,600
Miriam,

879
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,400
I'm all wet.

880
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:51,000
Her water's broke. The baby's coming.

881
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,900
Shit. Shit!

882
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,300
All right, sweetheart. All right, sweetheart. Everything is fine. Breathe.

883
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,300
Just breathe it out. That's it.

884
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,800
Tomorrow you'll be safe. You'll be on the boat.

885
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:05,400
On the Tomorrow, they'll take care of you.

886
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,800
They'll take you far away from all this.

887
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,100
Look up, you piece of shite. Look up.

888
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,600
Out!

889
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,200
Get out!

890
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:28,200
Lord, give Kee the strength to know that she has the power already within her.

891
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,900
- She has the wisdom... - What's wrong with you?

892
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,900
I said, what's wrong with you?

893
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:33,700
Look at me! I said, what's wrong with you?

894
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,300
- Saint Gabriel, help us... - Shut up!

895
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,100
- You! Out! - Saint Gabriel, come to our aid!

896
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:41,900
Listen, you fucking nutcase! Get out!

897
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,300
- Up, now. Come on. - Caca! Caca!

898
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,800
Piss. Piss. Caca. Smell. Girl.

899
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:52,800
You smell it yourself. You fucking people disgust me.

900
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:05,600
She's okay, Kee. She's okay.

901
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:07,900
- She's gonna be... - Miriam!

902
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,100
Move it! Come along now!

903
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:35,400
Come on, shift it! Shift it! You!

904
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,400
Get down there. Down there. Move.

905
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,300
Follow the line!

906
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,100
- Theo! - Kee!

907
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,100
- Take it off! - Theo!

908
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:55,600
Come on, move! Move it! Come on!

909
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,700
Move it! Move it!

910
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,100
Come on! Move! Move!

911
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:03,300
Britain supports you and provides you shelter.

912
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,500
Do not support terrorists.

913
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,700
Britain supports you and provides you shelter.

914
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:11,100
Do not support terrorists.

915
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:20,300
Hey you, buddy! Buddy, buddy, welcome to paradise!

916
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,700
You want accommodations? I got running water! I got...

917
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,300
Just leave the girl alone.

918
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,900
- Who the fuck are you to tell me what to do? - Fuck off.

919
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,700
- Who do you fucking think you are? - Fuck off.

920
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,700
Don't mind these bastards. I'll take care of you.

921
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,200
Come on, I've got a room, food, a place to stay. What do you need?

922
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:35,700
- I'm fine, thanks. - You must need something, man.

923
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,600
"Fuck off," is it? Bollocks.

924
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,600
Marichka?

925
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:03,800
It's okay, Kee.

926
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:07,000
Just breathe through it.

927
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:11,600
That's it. It's okay. We're almost there, Kee.

928
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,100
We're almost there.

929
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,500
It's just a few stairs.

930
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,300
Just hold onto me.

931
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,300
I've got you.

932
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,800
Just keep breathing.

933
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,000
Marichka? How far?

934
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,100
How far?

935
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,100
We're almost there, Kee. Almost there.

936
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,200
You're doing great. Come on.

937
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,500
You're almost there. Three more steps.

938
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,300
We're there, Kee. We're there.

939
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:19,100
Okay, there's a bed. Easy.

940
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:23,000
Make her go! Make her go!

941
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,300
That's great. Thank you.

942
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,400
Get her out!

943
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,300
Get her out!

944
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:40,900
Thank you.

945
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,400
Okay, Kee.

946
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:57,800
I'm going to put my coat underneath. You'll be cleaner.

947
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,800
You're okay.

948
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,800
Okay?

949
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,400
There's water. I'm just going to wash my hands.

950
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:17,300
- Theo! Theo! - I'm here. Fuck!

951
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:20,200
It's okay. Everything's okay.

952
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,200
Do something!

953
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:29,500
It's looking good, Kee. It's looking good.

954
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:32,800
You're doing great. Just keep breathing.

955
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:35,200
- Keep breathing. - I am breathing!

956
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,800
No, like Miriam said. Do you remember? Breathe out. Just think about the out.

957
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,400
Breathe out and push. Push as well.

958
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,600
- That's it. That's it! - I can't!

959
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:50,800
Yes, you can. Yes, you can. Just out and push.

960
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,900
Out and push.

961
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,500
- That's it! - I can't do it, Theo. Stop it, please.

962
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,100
Kee, I can see the head. I can see the head.

963
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:02,000
You're doing great. You're doing great, Kee.

964
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,200
That's it. That's it.

965
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:10,100
It's coming again. Just breathe out and push. Out and push.

966
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,000
- That's it. Out and... - I can't.

967
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:14,300
- You can. Yes, you can. - I fucking can't!

968
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,500
- Yes, you fucking can! Come on! - I can't do it.

969
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,500
Kee, the head's coming out.

970
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:22,700
That's it, you're nearly there! You're nearly there. Just push!

971
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,500
Push, Kee! Push!

972
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,200
Push!

973
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,100
Oh, my God.

974
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,600
How is he?

975
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,200
It's a girl.

976
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,200
Kee, you've got a girl.

977
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,200
Hey, baba.

978
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,600
- Aren't we supposed to cut the cord? - Yeah, it's okay. There's no rush.

979
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,200
You've done it.

980
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,000
Kee,

981
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,600
see?

982
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:18,900
It wasn't that bad.

983
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,900
Oh, yeah, not for you.

984
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,900
Come on! Hurry up! We don't have much time!

985
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,600
Who is it?

986
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:48,000
The King of England. Open the door, you asshole. It's Syd.

987
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:57,300
How can you sleep through when the whole city's going to hell?

988
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:01,300
- What's wrong with her? - She's fine. It's a woman's thing.

989
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,400
Fuck off!

990
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:06,400
A few hours ago, a bomb blew a hole in the fence and fugees got out.

991
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:07,800
But Syd happens to know,

992
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:10,300
the hole in the fence isn't about fugees getting out.

993
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:12,100
- It's about Fishies getting in. - Go away.

994
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,800
Syd also happens to know that the Army's gonna blow the shit out of this place.

995
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,400
But don't worry. Syd is here to get you out.

996
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,400
Fuck off. Go away. Go on. Piss off!

997
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,100
Get your fucking dog.

998
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,300
What you got there?

999
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,200
- Nothing. - Nothing?

1000
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:34,200
- Nothing. - No?

1001
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,500
- Like to show me? - I don't have anything.

1002
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,600
- It's nothing. - Well, if it's nothing, then I can have a look.

1003
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,800
- It's nothing. - Let me see.

1004
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,200
- No. - Let me see.

1005
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:51,300
It's okay. Let me see.

1006
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:54,500
Jesus Christ.

1007
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:56,800
Jesus Christ.

1008
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,800
- That's a... - That's right.

1009
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,100
We got a baby.

1010
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:06,300
And now we need a rowboat. Can you help us?

1011
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,600
Get her up. Get her up. We need to go.

1012
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:11,000
Can you help us get a boat?

1013
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:14,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just get her up. We need to go. We need to go now.

1014
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,500
- What's she saying? - Fuck knows.

1015
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,800
Bad! Bad! Bad!

1016
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,000
- She doesn't want us to go. -  Shut up.

1017
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,800
We need to go.

1018
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:32,100
Syd was watching television last night with Mommy.

1019
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,400
She's a sweet old soul. Dying of cancer. It's heartbreaking.

1020
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,400
And then the news came on, and you two were on it.

1021
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,800
Something about a cop killer.

1022
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,500
Something about a big reward.

1023
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,400
Syd then finds out the Fishes are looking for you.

1024
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,200
So Syd thinks, "If the Fishes are looking for you,

1025
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:54,100
"and the coppers are looking for you,

1026
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,600
"you people are first class commodities."

1027
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,400
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

1028
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,900
Down, down, down!

1029
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,800
Now, Syd has a baby.

1030
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,200
Bad! Bad! Bad!

1031
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,500
Marichka!

1032
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:28,300
I'll fucking kill you, you bitch! I'll fucking kill you!

1033
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,100
Bitch. You bitch.

1034
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:39,300
Baby! Marichka baby!

1035
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,500
Quick, quick. The baby!

1036
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:46,400
My baby! She took...

1037
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:50,000
I'll fucking kill you, you gypsy bitch!

1038
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,700
I'm gonna blow your fucking brains out.

1039
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,100
Go, go!

1040
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,700
Fuck! Shit.

1041
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,400
How are you doing?

1042
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,300
- How are you? - It hurts.

1043
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,900
Marichka, we need a boat.

1044
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:40,500
A boat. The sea, a boat, a rowboat.

1045
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:43,800
We need a boat.

1046
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:49,400
A fucking boat! A boat.

1047
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:52,000
- A rowboat! - Yes.

1048
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:53,800
Hurry.

1049
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,300
- You okay? Come on. - Hurry.

1050
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,000
Hurry. Hurry.

1051
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:53,900
It's okay.

1052
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,200
Look at that, Theo. They love my baby.

1053
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,400
I want to call her Bazouka.

1054
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,100
Bazouka?

1055
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,100
You don't like it?

1056
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,200
I was getting used to Froley.

1057
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Froley's a man's name.

1058
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:58,900
What is he thinking, giving you a boy's name? You're a girl.

1059
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:03,100
We have a boat. Stay here. In one hour, we go.

1060
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,100
Thanks.

1061
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,200
Human Project real?

1062
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:09,500
It better be.

1063
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,500
Drop your gun! Drop your gun!

1064
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,100
Put your hands up! Put your fucking hands in the air!

1065
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:37,500
Okay, is clear! Is clear!

1066
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,600
Hands above your head and fucking move that here.

1067
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:40,900
You killed my fucking cousin!

1068
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:42,800
Get on your knees! On your knees, you fucking...

1069
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:44,800
He was 19!

1070
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:46,800
Don't kill him!

1071
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:48,900
Don't kill him!

1072
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:51,900
Watch the flanks!

1073
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:55,100
Kee. Thank God.

1074
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,700
You'll be safe now. How's the child?

1075
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,800
You put their lives at risk.

1076
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:09,600
Just let her go. You don't know what you're doing.

1077
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:12,200
No? Look around you.

1078
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:14,000
It's the Uprising.

1079
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:16,900
And they haven't even seen the baby. Let's go.

1080
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:18,700
No! Get off...

1081
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:20,800
Not in front of the girl.

1082
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:23,700
Wait till we get around the corner. Then do them all.

1083
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:24,900
Come on!

1084
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
(SINGING) Oh, lads

1085
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:29,900
You should have seen us gannin'

1086
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:35,100
Passing the folks along the road And all of them was starin'

1087
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:40,200
And all the lads and lasses there They all had smilin' faces

1088
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,700
Fuck!

1089
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,500
Sorry. Sorry.

1090
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,700
Move it! Get her inside!

1091
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:49,800
Faron!

1092
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:02,200
Get her inside! Get her in the building now!

1093
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,300
Now! Move it! Now!

1094
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:30,000
Sarge, left flank!

1095
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,600
Slug the fuckers!

1096
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,300
Don't shoot! Citizens! We citizens!

1097
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,800
Go check the roof!

1098
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:13,900
I was carrying the baby up the stairs.

1099
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:16,700
I started crying.

1100
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:20,600
I'd forgotten what they looked like. They're so beautiful.

1101
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:22,800
They're so tiny.

1102
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,400
Julian was wrong!

1103
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,600
She thought it could be peaceful!

1104
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:32,500
But how can it be peaceful when they try to take away your dignity?

1105
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,200
We need him, Theo!

1106
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:38,100
We need the baby. We need him!

1107
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:43,100
It's a girl, Luke.

1108
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:47,700
A girl?

1109
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:51,500
I had a sister.

1110
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:56,500
Theo! Theo!

1111
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,200
You okay?

1112
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:19,500
How is she?

1113
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,300
Annoyed.

1114
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:35,800
My God, the baby.

1115
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:38,700
Move back! Fucking move back!

1116
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:45,300
Stop! Cease fire! Cease firing!

1117
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:48,400
Cease firing!  Cease firing!

1118
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,900
- Cease firing! - Cease firing!

1119
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:08,400
We've got two coming through, coming out.

1120
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:07,900
Second floor, left!

1121
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:11,600
Medic!

1122
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:26,400
Marichka!

1123
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:13,200
No, Marichka no go. You go.

1124
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:16,400
- You go. - Marichka, come. Marichka.

1125
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:19,500
- Marichka, get in the boat! - Go, boat!

1126
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,400
The buoy! Theo, the buoy!

1127
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,500
You okay?

1128
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,500
Yeah. You?

1129
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,100
Yeah.

1130
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:51,000
What a day.

1131
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:54,200
We're too late, aren't we?

1132
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,200
No. No, we're fine.

1133
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:57,700
But they said they wouldn't wait.

1134
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:00,400
Trust me. They'll come back.

1135
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:17,200
I'm bleeding. Jesus, shit, I'm bleeding!

1136
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:19,900
- No, no, no, it's me. - I'm bleeding everywhere.

1137
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:23,000
- It's me. - What?

1138
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:25,900
He got me.

1139
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,400
Bad?

1140
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:29,800
No. I'm fine.

1141
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:32,900
Keep her close, Kee.

1142
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:37,500
Whatever happens, whatever they say,

1143
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:40,600
you keep her close.

1144
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,100
It's going to be okay.

1145
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:56,300
She's probably got wind. Wind her.

1146
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,500
Put her on your shoulder.

1147
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:02,700
Just... Just tap her back.

1148
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:13,000
Gently.

1149
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:20,000
Gently.

1150
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:35,500
There you go.

1151
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:40,500
Oh, Jesus.

1152
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:45,200
Dylan.

1153
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:51,800
I'll call my baby Dylan. It's a girl's name, too.

1154
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:15,800
Theo?

1155
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:20,700
Theo?

1156
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,400
Theo!

1157
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:45,100
Theo, the boat.

1158
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:49,400
The boat!

1159
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:52,900
It's okay.

1160
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,100
We are safe now.

1161
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,800
We're safe.
