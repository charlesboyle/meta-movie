you became such a successful politician

339
00:25:17,147 --> 00:25:19,741
precisely because
you didn't appear to be a politician.

340
00:25:19,816 --> 00:25:22,444
lt's certainly not something l wanted to do
when l was younger.

were complete nerds.

Let's see, l was 23, something like that,
a couple of years out of Cambridge.

346

And l remember it was a Sunday afternoon,
it was raining.

347
00:25:43,874 --> 00:25:47,571
l was still in bed.
And someone starts knocking at the door.

348
00:25:48,845 --> 00:25:51,507
And, you know,
l'd been out the night before

349
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:54,106
and had a few drinks and what have you.

350
00:25:54,184 --> 00:25:56,982
So, l get the pillow and l put it
over my head, and it starts up again.

351

Knock, knock, knock, knock!

352
00:25:58,655 --> 00:26:02,614
And l get up, l'm swearing,
l go to the door and there's this girl.

353
00:26:02,692 --> 00:26:06,594
She's soaking wet, but she just launches
into this speech about the local elections.

354
00:26:06,663 --> 00:26:08,187

This is Ruth.

357
00:26:15,805 --> 00:26:19,241
And the only way l can see her again
is to join the party and hand out leaflets.

358

-Paul Emmett?
-What's he doing here?

1500
01:58:51,255 --> 01:58:53,951
Well, he was Ruth's tutor at Harvard
when she was a Fulbright scholar.

1501
01:58:54,025 --> 01:58:55,617
Why shouldn't he be here?

But never more than tonight.

1513

Not just 'cause we're meeting
to launch his wonderful new book

1514
02:00:17,008 --> 02:00:20,603
and he should be here to share
the joy of his life story with us,

1515
02:00:21,412 --> 02:00:25,371

Mike, our thoughts are with you.

1531
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:27,241
ln these very difficult few months,
l've drawn great comfort from this book,

1532
02:01:27,311 --> 02:01:32,146
from knowing that, despite the terrible
double tragedy of losing both of them,

1533
02:01:32,650 --> 02:01:36,484
Mike and Adam did at least live long
enough to complete it.

1534
02:01:37,321 --> 02:01:41,257
And l really believe that,
as people read these pages,

1535

Adam's voice will keep on coming through
for generations to come,
