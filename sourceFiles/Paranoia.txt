2
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,562
<i>I'm not gonna make excuses.</i>

3
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,690
<i>I asked for this.</i>

4
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,885
<i>All of it.</i>

5
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,645
<i>And I did it to become s
omeone else.</i>

6
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,844
<i>I wanted more.</i>

7
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,242
<i>We belong to a generation that watched
our future get stolen out from under us.</i>

8
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,090
<i>The American Dream our parents knew
has been hijacked by men</i>

9
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,564
<i>who are willing to lie, cheat and steal
to protect their wealth.</i>

10
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,325
<i>Used to be if you got good grades,
you got into the right school,</i>

11
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,970
<i>got the right job.</i>

12
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,124
<i>And after 15 years of hard work,</i>

13
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,009
<i>you get your name on the door.</i>

14
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,089
<i>But that world is gone.</i>

15
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,205
<i>People always tell you
be careful what you wish for.</i>

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,445
<i>I never believed them.</i>

17
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,731
<i>The lights always looked brighter
across the river.</i>

18
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,004
Hey, come on!

19
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,804
Hey, I'm coming. Chill.

20
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,204
I'm paying extra for that?

21
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,283
Don't worry, it's covered, Scout.

22
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,046
- Nothing's covered, Dad.
- Where you going?

23
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,326
I'm going to the club with Kev.

24
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,682
- Which one?
- Why? You think you might know it?

25
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,004
Well, I have been known to frequent
discotheques in my heyday.

26
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,891
They don't call them that
anymore, but that's good.

27
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,042
Hey, don't let him smoke. He hides
cigars under that cushion there.

28
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,964
Don't smoke!

29
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,929
What's the matter? You jealous?

30
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,401
Oh, yes.

31
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,924
Club Rise, baby.
What took you so long?

32
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,121
Why don't you do yourself a favor
and lift the rope?

33
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,647
And how is that
doing me a favor?

34
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,086
Consider it an investment.

35
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,083
Come Monday, my boy and I
will be making so much money,

36
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,811
you'll be begging us to come back
to this flavor of the month of yours.

37
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,080
Look, no hipsters
and no virgins.

38
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,004
Virgin?

39
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,686
He's not a virgin.
I just watched him get laid outside.

40
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,808
I watched it,
I literally saw him get laid.

41
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,928
- Adam, come on.
- I saw him with my own eyes.

42
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,969
I'm going to be back.

43
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,086
Are you nervous yet?

44
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,647
Nervous? About what?

45
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,964
On Monday we pitch our product
to Nicolas freaking Wyatt, that's what.

46
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,126
Kevin, we've been working on that pitch
for four months. It's genius.

47
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,520
The only thing
I'm worried about is

48
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,251
who Wyatt's gonna fire
for not promoting us sooner.

49
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,127
How great is it gonna be
to pay our bills

50
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,123
and eat in the same month?

51
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,089
Oh, get ready
'cause it's happening.

52
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,483
You always say it's happening,
and then I end up paying for the cab.

53
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,842
This time's different.

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,810
This pitch,
it's gonna change our lives.

55
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,686
Promise you.

56
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,729
But I'm still paying for the cab, right?

57
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,484
- Yeah.
- Got you.

58
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,450
It's not me.

59
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,402
Hello?

60
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,284
Yeah, I'll be right there.

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,321
Sir, can you turn around? We need
to go to Saint Joe's Hospital.

62
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,843
Adam, he's doing great.

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,526
He's up to his old tricks.
He's right through there.

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,446
We cleared out
the mucus, and he's fine.

65
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,443
But he must use
the oxygen more,

66
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,206
and he has to call us
at the onset of congestion.

67
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,842
- Yeah, he knows.
- Wants to do it his own way, huh?

68
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,201
Yeah.

69
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,204
- You can take him home.
- All right. Thanks.

70
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,170
As you can see, Mr. Cassidy,

71
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,166
the last two procedures
were not covered by insurance.

72
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,528
What do you mean?
I have extended coverage.

73
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,330
You did.
Wyatt Corp terminated it.

74
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,204
They can't do that. I have it.
I need to have it.

75
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,169
Unfortunately, they can.

76
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,164
A lot of our companies
are doing it now, cutbacks.

77
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,247
I don't have 40 grand.

78
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,768
We can help with a payment plan,
or a medical loan.

79
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,370
I'm really sorry.

80
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,364
Yeah. I'll figure something out.

81
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,441
We did everything we could.

82
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,688
<i>We work for Wyatt Corp,</i>

83
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,241
<i>one of the top tech companies
on the planet.</i>

84
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,364
<i>When they hired us,
we were going to take over the world.</i>

85
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,643
<i>Six years in,
we were still just lowly cubicle drones,</i>

86
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,531
<i>watching our bosses take home
obscene bonuses...</i>

87
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,402
<i>...while we were stuck
with entry-level salaries.</i>

88
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,170
<i>We'd waited long enough.
It was our turn.</i>

89
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,402
<i>Our time to shine.</i>

90
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,601
You all right?

91
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,924
Yeah. We're gonna kill it.

92
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,449
Yeah, well, if things go south,
just stay cool. All right?

93
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,287
Yeah.

94
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,891
Mr. Wyatt is ready.

95
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,445
Stay cool.

96
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,446
Good morning.

97
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,569
We are all in the business
of connecting people.

98
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,245
This water's not hot enough.

99
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,724
I'm sorry, Mr. Wyatt.
I'll take care of it.

100
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,646
It should be boiling.

101
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,368
Uh... We're in the business
of connecting people.

102
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,244
You already said that.

103
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,486
Right. That's what our customers have
always wanted. To stay connected.

104
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,166
Those same customers are now texting
more than they're talking

105
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,691
and tweeting more
than they're meeting.

106
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,207
So, what's changed?
What are we missing?

107
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,966
We don't want to be
connected anymore.

108
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,128
We just want to feel connected
while we isolate.

109
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,487
So, what if...

110
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,364
...a four-inch mobile had
a 60-inch screen?

111
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,208
Well, then it wouldn't be mobile.

112
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,284
With a voice-activated pairing device,
Ethion will allow users

113
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,364
to broadcast their mobile
across any monitor in the home.

114
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,521
Pick up.

115
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,522
Ethion 3.0 gives you the power
to bring your world to you.

116
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,682
Is he pitching me software?

117
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,726
Sir, we see a unique opportunity to take
Ethion from a run-of-the-mill phone...

118
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,929
This is a re-branding meeting.
Where's the disconnect?

119
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,281
Well, sir, I believe the disconnect is
between you and the consumers.

120
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,087
You didn't hire us to sit around
and watch you make tea, did you?

121
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,408
Tell me, why did I hire you?

122
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,403
Because we know
what a younger generation wants.

123
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,527
Which is?

124
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,643
A phone that doesn't just look new
a phone that is new,

125
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,690
a phone that changes the way we live.

126
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,446
You know, you're right.
I have lost touch with your generation.

127
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,806
What was your name again?

128
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,450
I'm Adam Cassidy.

129
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,806
How old are you?

130
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,405
Twenty-seven.

131
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,244
When I was two years younger
than you are now,

132
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,085
I was pioneering
digital cellular technology

133
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,204
while my colleagues were still pissing
around with electronic pulses.

134
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,646
I had vision.

135
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,521
But you have all the technological
advantage imaginable

136
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,967
and what do you bring me?

137
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,885
Social networking on a television.

138
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,487
Next! Bring in Richard McAllister.

139
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,011
I'm sorry, guys.

140
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,606
You just left us standing there
looking like idiots.

141
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,842
I mean, what were you thinking?

142
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,480
<i>We all backed the idea.</i>

143
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,202
<i>Our idea wasn't the problem.
I railroaded him. You saw his face.</i>

144
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,603
<i>That's what happens when your team
leader goes rogue and argues with God.</i>

145
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,369
Well, uh... I guess now
that we're not working together

146
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,488
we can start sleeping
together, right?

147
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,682
I seriously hope
you're not talking to me.

148
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,763
We'll find new jobs, right?

149
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,684
We weren't laid off,
Chels. We were fired.

150
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,491
How are you going to explain
that on your resume?

151
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,681
You know what? The least I can do
is buy you guys a few drinks.

152
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,524
Our discretionary account? Really?

153
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,968
Adam, no. If Wyatt ever found out
that we spent any more money...

154
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,400
What are they going to do? Fire us?

155
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,121
The money was ours to spend
as we see fit. We're going to Rise.

156
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,362
- We can't get in there.
- Yes, we can.

157
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,649
- Yes, we can.
- Try and stop the guy.

158
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,724
We're going to Rise,
baby! Oh, yeah!

159
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,201
Dude, you realize this is
going to be so awesome.

160
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,129
- We're going to pop ten bottles.
- Think so?

161
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,408
I hate this doorman.

162
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,691
Adam Cassidy.
Told you I'd be back.

163
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,370
Your table's right this way, sir.

164
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,409
Yeah!

165
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,370
- Yeah!
- Oh!

166
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,170
- Shots!
- Shots!

167
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,845
- Shots!
- Oh my God.

168
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,650
Ooh!

169
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,051
if you guys don't get lucky tonight,
it's never going to happen.

170
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,043
I'm fielding offers. You want in?

171
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,321
See me after.

172
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,480
- Cheers, guys!
- Whoo!

173
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,650
Yeah!

174
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,121
Adam, maybe
we should close out the tab.

175
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,601
Hey, don't worry about it, man,
don't worry about it.

176
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,330
Hey, can we get
another bottle of Ciroc?

177
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,726
- Twirl me!
- No, no, no.

178
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,607
Come on!

179
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,371
Hey, buddy, where you going?

180
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,528
Could be love.

181
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,521
Wake up.

182
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,728
Hey, wake up.

183
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,287
- Hmm?
- I have to go.

184
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,885
So do you.

185
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,886
No breakfast?

186
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,646
Did I, uh,
do something wrong?

187
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,566
If you had done something wrong,
you wouldn't be here, would you?

188
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,963
So...

189
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,282
So, uh, we...

190
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,681
...are leaving.

191
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,326
Wait a second,
I don't even know your name.

192
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,406
Are you taking the fire escape?

193
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,126
OK.

194
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,362
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

195
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,764
Hey. Black,
or cream and sugar?

196
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,366
- You stalking me now?
- I just want to know your name.

197
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,882
Why? So you can poke me,
friend me, ask for my number?

198
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,327
Or you could
just give me your number.

199
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,766
You're not
relationship material.

200
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,445
Relationship?
You're looking for a relationship?

201
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,284
I love relationships.
I'm great at relationships.

202
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,404
No. Actually, I'm just trying
to get rid of you nicely.

203
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,884
Didn't we have sex?

204
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,564
I have a thing for bridge-and-tunnel
guys when I drink.

205
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,927
Did you just call me
bridge-and-tunnel?

206
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,325
You took me out
for cheese fries.

207
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,801
Cheese fries!

208
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,166
Oh. Then what?

209
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,641
Then you had the night of your life.

210
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,251
Your words, not mine.

211
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,926
Oh... Black.

212
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,971
Adam Cassidy?
My name is Miles Meachum.

213
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,083
Mr. Wyatt would like to speak with you.

214
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,250
How did you know where I was?

215
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,207
I mean, I don't even live around here.

216
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,050
Ah! Mr. Cassidy.

217
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,084
The man who claims he knows
my business better than I do.

218
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,765
Here, take a seat.

219
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,130
- Drop of vino?
- Uh... No.

220
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,205
It seems you were the beneficiary
of an accounting error we made.

221
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,051
I don't know
what you're talking about.

222
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,009
The Ethion discretionary
fund.

223
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,886
Where's my money?

224
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,122
We used it on market research.

225
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,726
At Club Rise?

226
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,370
Sixteen grand?

227
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,683
It must be a very detailed report.

228
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,881
You think you can rip me off
and get away with it?

229
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,411
Credit card fraud?

230
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,642
No, sir, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna pay you back.

231
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,043
No you won't. It wasn't a loan.

232
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,931
Now there's two ways
we can play this.

233
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,481
Are you a horse or a dog?

234
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,769
A horse is motivated by fear.
He's running from the whip.

235
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,922
The whip here being felony fraud.

236
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,686
- He's a dog.
- A dog is motivated by hunger.

237
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,922
He's chasing the rabbit,
his next meal.

238
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,765
You were raised
in a low-income home in Brooklyn.

239
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,127
Your mother died
when you were seven.

240
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,726
Your W-2 says you
now support your father.

241
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,927
30?

242
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,048
So, it means you came
across that bridge every day

243
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,605
hungry to succeed.

244
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,922
- Everyone wants to succeed.
- Yeah, but not like us.

245
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,289
Your father spent <i>32</i> years
as a security guard.

246
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,807
- Where's the ambition in that?
- What's this about?

247
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,162
You want more out of life!

248
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,211
I grew up like you.
I mean, different streets.

249
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,807
Same dream,
but nobody gave it to me. No one.

250
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,203
And what if I told you
I could make you rich?

251
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,169
And give your friends their jobs back?

252
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,082
That was a smart pitch
you gave yesterday.

253
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,410
I started out at Eikon.

254
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,327
Jock Goddard was my mentor.

255
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,209
Do you know him?

256
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,169
Yeah, of course I know him.

257
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,527
I did my graduate thesis
on semi-conductor memory.

258
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,002
Goddard's basically the reason
cell phones aren't the size of bricks.

259
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,127
He founded Eikon.

260
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,169
And built it
into the largest publicly traded

261
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,890
technology company in the world.

262
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,690
And ever since I left,
he has spent

263
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,008
every waking moment
trying to destroy me.

264
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,960
Eikon has a new smartphone coming
that's said to be a game-changer.

265
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,770
They're calling it Occura.

266
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,446
You are going to work for Eikon.

267
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,120
- What?
- Get us in the door, you get 500K.

268
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,851
Get us what we need, you'll see
another million in stock options.

269
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,001
Money like that

270
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,003
would allow you to take care
of your father and a whole lot more.

271
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,242
Eikon's not just going
to hire me.

272
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,920
They will when
we're done with you.

273
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,689
This is illegal.
It's stealing trade secrets.

274
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,889
This is the opportunity
you have been waiting for.

275
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,401
Now, you could have done a lot of things
with that credit card last night.

276
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,929
Your father's health insurance premium,
graduate school loans,

277
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,165
but you decided to take your mates
out on the town, living it large.

278
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,164
Because you want to know
how the other half lives.

279
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,210
We are the other half!

280
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,762
That's what I'm offering you.

281
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,041
If I say no?

282
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,046
You and your friends will be prosecuted
to the full extent of the law.

283
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,524
And you don't want to sit around
and watch me make tea, do you?

284
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,328
What are you, the TV police?

285
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,126
- You were asleep.
- My eyes were closed.

286
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,089
Where you going?

287
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,528
- I caught a break at the company.
- A break, what kind of break?

288
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,604
A kind of break that pays our rent
and keeps your pretty nurse around.

289
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,489
It's a training thing,
so I'll be gone all weekend.

290
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,450
It's Friday night. I thought we were
going to Benzio's for pizza and beer.

291
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,649
I got to work, Dad. That's how you
climb the ladder in this business.

292
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,768
You work harder than the guy below you.

293
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,247
Otherwise you get stuck
doing the same job your whole life.

294
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,448
Look...

295
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,802
Here's some money.
You can order in, OK?

296
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,247
No, no. Thanks.

297
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,886
All right.

298
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,484
What exactly do you do
for the company, Judith?

299
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,166
I have a PhD
in behavioral psychology.

300
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,164
I can take one look at you and tell you
why you haven't succeeded.

301
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,163
Why don't you tell me
how you really feel?

302
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,845
I can give you the tools to ascend

303
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,321
to the highest ranks
of corporate America.

304
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,289
But you have to lose the attitude.

305
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,760
This way.

306
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,046
I'll show you to your room.

307
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,609
When we meet someone, an immediate
cognitive process takes place.

308
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,843
We construct our first ideas on them
based on their appearance.

309
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,210
So, if you want to be accepted,
you have to look the part.

310
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,004
You have to fit in to get in.

311
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,288
What happened with Wyatt and Goddard?

312
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,680
Jack's a brilliant businessman.

313
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,004
He was always able to imbue his products
with a magic of big ideas,

314
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,770
but Wyatt was the brains.

315
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,207
Without his designs,
none of it would have been possible.

316
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,283
Hmm. Sounds like a perfect pairing.

317
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,411
For Goddard, yes. Wyatt gave him
the best years of his life.

318
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,284
Jock lost his son Dylan
to a drug overdose.

319
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,046
So, if you talk
about losing your mother...

320
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,806
No, I won't.

321
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,726
Then, appeal to his void.
Say you had no father figure.

322
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,291
I have a father.

323
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,448
You don't aspire to be like him.

324
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,445
<i>Which brings us to trust.</i>

325
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,404
<i>If you can convince him
that you're just like him,</i>

326
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,370
<i>that you share the same
beliefs as him,</i>

327
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,931
<i>it will engender trust.</i>

328
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,246
<i>And trust is
the holy grail of espionage.</i>

329
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,370
She makes it sound so easy.

330
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,763
But this is a man who recognized me
for who I was years before I did.

331
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,164
He kept me close because that's
what you do with an enemy.

332
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,688
When I got restless, he promised me
partnership. It was genius.

333
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,367
I saw the finish line
and I gave him every good idea I ha...

334
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,366
- Who's this?
- He's the new tailor.

335
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,488
I'm George Gardelo, sir.

336
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,726
Would you excuse us,
George?

337
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,484
- Yes. Of course.
- Just for a second.

338
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,209
What's going on?

339
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,965
<i>That's how it happens.</i>

340
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,966
A little guy with a needle and thread
brings down an empire.

341
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,363
You really believe that?

342
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,922
Look, it doesn't matter. If you let
no one in, you get burned by no one.

343
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,408
You know what Picasso said?

344
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:56,566
"A good artist copies.
A great artist steals."

345
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,404
There's nothing original left
in the world, Adam.

346
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,688
We're all stealing
from someone.

347
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,491
You might want
to remember that.

348
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,202
If I lose one percent market share,

349
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,091
one percent, and I'm ruined.

350
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,401
There is the Dutch deal,

351
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,211
but they're offering half
of what Eikon's willing to pay you.

352
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,044
No, no, I don't care.

353
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,886
I would rather counter
the Dutch for a fraction

354
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,769
than sell to Goddard.

355
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,321
Anything's better than Eikon.

356
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,771
I know.

357
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,726
Hello?

358
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,444
When are you going to find
my friends jobs?

359
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,206
As soon as you get me what I need.

360
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,610
You only have one shot at this.

361
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,442
Mate.

362
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,089
<i>Tom Lungren is executive
hiring coordinator for Eikon.</i>

363
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,767
<i>Your objective here
is to connect.</i>

364
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,331
Adam?

365
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,323
- Tom.
- Tom Lungren.

366
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,131
Nice to meet you.
Let me introduce Emma Jennings,

367
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,288
head of our marketing department.

368
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,362
Nice to meet you, Emma.

369
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,851
Please, sit down.

370
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,487
Well, let me start off
by saying that we're

371
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,610
huge fans of the work you did
on Ethion 3.0.

372
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,529
Well, you know,
it hasn't been released yet, so.

373
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,365
Is that because power management
doesn't deliver?

374
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,363
No, the power management is fine.

375
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,090
That's not what we've heard.

376
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,685
We're tweaking
the networking module to make

377
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,205
download speed
the fastest on the market.

378
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,681
Oh, God. I hope that's not why
we agreed to meet with him.

379
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,490
Can you talk specs?

380
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,564
The Orion was an LTE Advanced
with max speeds of 44.2 mbps.

381
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,563
Our new platform is
a WAVE OS 7.5...

382
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,371
Which probably won't solve
the biggest issues you had with 7.0.

383
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,524
- It outsold your model two to one.
- Yeah, the marketing was genius.

384
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,648
I spearheaded that campaign.

385
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,451
Then you know
you're good at hiding flaws.

386
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,565
Have you two met?

387
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,245
No.

388
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,210
No.

389
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,681
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

390
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,768
Always do your homework.
That's what you said, isn't it?

391
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,365
Next time
follow your own advice.

392
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,166
<i>- It wasn't Tom Lungren?
- It wasn't just Tom Lungren.</i>

393
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,845
I told you he might bring
someone else.

394
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,206
Someone that I knew?

395
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,603
What happened?

396
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,606
I saved the day. Connected.
Pulled an offer, a big-ass offer.

397
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,809
Let's take
you to your new apartment.

398
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,611
- What apartment?
- You'll see.

399
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,008
Whoa.

400
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,730
Thought you'd like it.

401
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,643
This is mine?

402
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,167
Of course.

403
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,244
Eikon's newest executive
needs to look the part.

404
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,962
It's nice to see you again, Adam.

405
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,210
Per our agreement, we've deposited
$500,000 into an escrow account.

406
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,648
We're hearing Goddard could
debut Aurora in the next two months,

407
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,644
so I've downloaded background files
on all your co-workers.

408
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,844
First, Emma Jennings.

409
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,809
Father, George Jennings, was

410
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,611
Chief of Surgery
at New York Presbyterian.

411
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,489
She grew up with four brothers,

412
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,127
was always on the outside
of the boys club, looking in.

413
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,204
Desperately wants to succeed
in a man's world,

414
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,721
so she's always the most prepared
person in the room.

415
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,042
Would have been useful
a couple of hours ago.

416
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,249
Don't waste your time.
She has certain standards.

417
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,605
Judith, maybe you're not as smart
as you think you are.

418
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,809
Now don't always say
what you think, darling.

419
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,403
Because from here on out,
you are all the way under.

420
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,450
We'll be communicating
through this phone only.

421
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,681
You will respond to my calls,
no matter the time, day or night.

422
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,002
You got it.

423
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,444
Good morning, sir.

424
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,887
I want a copy of his
body scan sent to my office.

425
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,087
Yes, sir.

426
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,085
- Adam.
- Mr. Lungren.

427
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,005
I told you. You gotta stop calling me
that, you're gonna make me feel old.

428
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,447
- Welcome to Eikon.
- Thank you. It's great to be here.

429
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,171
- We're damn glad to have you.
- OK, good.

430
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,766
The lower floors are Legal, HR,

431
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,804
middle floors are all the other
departments, including marketing.

432
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,804
The 38th floor is R&D,
top security projects.

433
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,201
And we're here on the 40th.

434
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,931
There's just a few tricks to being
in this building and getting around.

435
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,610
Your thumbprint on a keycard app
generates a bar code

436
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,924
that gets you anywhere
your clearance is allowed.

437
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,809
All right.

438
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,850
<i>So any words of wisdom
on Goddard?</i>

439
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,923
<i>Be brilliant and be genuine.</i>

440
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,448
He can spot a fraud a mile away.
Here's your office.

441
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,162
So, Type X was meant
for social networking,

442
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,482
but it turns out that people don't
always want their friends

443
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,210
to know where they are so precisely.

444
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,727
Right. What's the system tech?

445
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,601
It's 3DPS, which is like GPS
plus precise triangulation.

446
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,966
I'm familiar with it.

447
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,527
Problem is, it's twice as heavy
with three times the battery drain.

448
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,286
So, you're handing me a dead fish.

449
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,166
You've got 72 hours
before you present to Goddard.

450
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,328
Thank you.

451
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,646
It's a real-time tracking device
that needs a new purpose.

452
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,167
It's all about the presentation.
You have to impress him.

453
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,926
Yes, I understand what I have to do.

454
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,009
I'll schedule a brainstorming session
with our best R&D guys.

455
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,088
Why do you do this work, Judith?

456
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,805
I mean, is it out of loyalty,
or is it just money?

457
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,010
Don't you have enough
to think about?

458
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,844
Rowena,
I need you to put together

459
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,604
an R&D focus group.

460
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,528
I don't care, wake them up.

461
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,889
Call me when everything's
in place. Bye.

462
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,007
Soldiers.

463
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,211
Soldiers need to know
where each other are at all times.

464
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,125
- They have GPS.
- Yeah.

465
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,567
GPS is great for navigation,
but it doesn't work indoors.

466
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,563
Can't tell if you're
on the first floor or the ninth,

467
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,210
so it's useless in urban warfare.

468
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,681
But with 3DPS,

469
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,601
if I can Trojan-horse tracking data
in an e-mail to each of them...

470
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,287
...I could make this thing work.

471
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,049
- Who are you calling?
- My own R&D focus group.

472
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,564
Yo, Kev, it's me.
I need your help.

473
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,091
I got recruited by one of those...

474
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,320
...headhunters.

475
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,042
Long story short,
I work for Eikon now.

476
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,926
I heard they weren't hiring.

477
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,964
I got lucky, I guess.

478
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,804
I guess.

479
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,367
Well, hey, I've been working
on what we talked about,

480
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,842
and the military thing is
definitely possible.

481
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,403
I just tweaked
the Eikon software a little.

482
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,402
I'm calling it the Boomerang.

483
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,489
Just check this out.

484
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,681
I sent your 3DPS data e-mail to you,
me and Allison.

485
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,764
So now our phones track each other
working in unison.

486
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,208
And you were right, the SDPS,
that's what makes the difference.

487
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,129
That was a good call, by the way.

488
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,008
Dude, that's awesome.
You crushed this. Good job.

489
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,640
Yeah, but that ain't all.

490
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,124
Pick up Allison.

491
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,005
<i>- What can I get you?
- Another OJ.</i>

492
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,127
<i>One more OJ.</i>

493
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,009
How the hell did you do that?

494
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,810
<i>Who orders orange juice in a bar?</i>

495
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,247
<i>Someone who wants to keep
his edge.</i>

496
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,323
<i>- What's your name?
- Allison.</i>

497
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,931
Do you know that guy?

498
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,640
Hey, OJ!

499
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,290
We're sleeping together, me and her.

500
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,168
Nice to meet you, Allison.

501
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,960
All I do is sit around here,
watching her get hit on all the time.

502
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,286
It's exhausting!

503
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,363
I need a job.

504
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,447
Good morning, Caroline.
Excuse me.

505
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,887
- Jock Goddard.
- Adam Cassidy.

506
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,089
Of course you are. Everything all right?
Settling in OK?

507
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,083
- Yeah. Thank you.
- How's your office?

508
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,210
- Oh, yeah, it's beautiful. Thank you.
- Good. Let's get started.

509
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,521
OK.

510
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,085
Well, sir, I'm afraid
you've wasted a lot of money

511
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,210
developing Type X
as a social networking device.

512
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,250
But the military applications
of this device are undeniable.

513
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,124
I sent you all an e-mail this morning

514
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,682
in which I encoded 3DPS-like data
to identify you.

515
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,242
Everyone I sent an e-mail to is
in this room. Except for one.

516
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,122
Death by friendly fire remains
a sad reality of war.

517
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,568
3DPS is more precise than GPS
and works on a Z-axis.

518
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,485
While the product was deemed
too heavy for civilians,

519
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,849
an added 12 ounces is
nothing to a soldier.

520
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,685
So this is all so you can see
what floor our phones are on?

521
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,247
Yes. 'Cause in the heat of battle
that can be the difference

522
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,165
between killing the enemy or...

523
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,530
...killing your own.

524
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,090
Type X just saved her life.

525
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,601
Good morning.

526
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,524
Good morning, sorry.

527
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,242
Morning.

528
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,971
How long have you had with this?

529
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,446
Seventy-two hours, sir.

530
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,122
Let's put together a team for Adam.

531
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,170
Design, engineering. Let's see
if we can get some DOD funding.

532
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,483
Issues? No? Good.

533
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,290
Good.

534
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,288
- Nice work.
- OK.

535
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,288
I thought that went pretty well.

536
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,171
Beginner's luck.

537
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,723
- You are hard to please.
- Not that you'd remember.

538
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,167
Let me take you
to dinner this weekend.

539
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,249
I have to be
in the Hamptons this weekend.

540
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,641
Oh, good. I'll come with you.

541
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,091
It wasn't an invitation.

542
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,450
OK.

543
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,205
<i>Hi, Adam. I'm calling
from Jock Goddard's office.</i>

544
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,806
<i>Jock is having a few people over
to his house in the Hamptons</i>

545
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,361
<i>on Saturday
and he'd like you to join him.</i>

546
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,208
So now we go
for military funding.

547
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,284
Dude, that's great.
Congratulations, man.

548
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,367
Hey, so, I got a favor to ask.

549
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,562
I got an interview at Eikon next week.

550
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,408
And I know I'm gonna be
another resume in a stack

551
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,722
if I don't build some traction.

552
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,368
Right.

553
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,809
So, I feel awkward
even asking you this, but...

554
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,644
Hey, of course.

555
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,729
All right,
I'll speak to HR on Monday.

556
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,370
All right.

557
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,200
Thanks.

558
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,321
Nicest guy.

559
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,087
Right through the red light
and hit the back of the car.

560
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,328
- Very apologetic.
- Somebody looks lost.

561
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,402
Oh, hey!

562
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,289
- Hi.
- Hey.

563
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,329
- There he is.
- I'm glad you could make it.

564
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,324
- Thanks for having me, Mr. Goddard.
- Jock.

565
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,130
- You know Tom, of course.
- Hey.

566
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,285
Jock tells me my stock's gone up
in value since your Type X pitch.

567
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,489
First time up at bat and you bang it
off the scoreboard? Way to go.

568
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,086
And this is Emma.
She's spearheading the marketing

569
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,720
on our new smartphone, Occura.

570
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,325
Nice suit.

571
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,565
Watch our for her. She's one
of those Ivy Leaguers. Princeton.

572
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,324
Yale, actually.

573
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,329
Where her brothers went.

574
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,126
How did you know
I went to Yale?

575
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,891
It was on Facebook
or something.

576
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,008
Ah.

577
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,328
So much for privacy.

578
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,371
Privacy.
Absolute myth, no such thing.

579
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,602
- Tom, you want a drink?
- Yeah, absolutely.

580
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,051
A glass of wine, sir?

581
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,089
- White wine.
- Mineral water, cold.

582
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,124
See you later.

583
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,246
Kind of like a Bordeaux,
more dry.

584
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,966
if you're looking
for the bathroom, you missed it.

585
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,087
Yeah, sorry, I, uh...

586
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,448
I saw the radio. Does it work?

587
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,207
Yeah, they work.
They all work. I built them.

588
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,887
That's how I spent
my teens. Ham radio.

589
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,610
Where'd you grow up?

590
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,889
Town of Hamilton, 3500 people.

591
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,202
Where is that?

592
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,165
It doesn't matter.

593
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,483
You remind me of Wyatt.
I'm surprised he let you go.

594
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,483
He wasn't too happy about it.

595
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,962
I knew he'd be
my competition someday.

596
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,088
I knew it before he did.

597
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,924
Why'd you take him
under your wing?

598
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,481
It's not about him.
It's about putting products out there

599
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,768
to make people's lives better.

600
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,968
Competition fuels innovation.

601
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,487
Without it, Eikon wouldn't
be where it is today.

602
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,489
And where is that?

603
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,650
On the eve of a revolution.

604
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,889
Is that your son?

605
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,640
Yeah, that's Dylan.

606
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,682
You have a bit of success,
you begin to think

607
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:51,209
that you've got some control
over things, but...

608
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,528
...shit happens to everybody.

609
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,251
Yeah.

610
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,647
I lost my mother when I was seven.

611
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,648
Do you remember her?

612
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,924
Not much.

613
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,560
I feel like I lose her
a little more every day.

614
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,245
Yeah.

615
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,569
Couple nights after Dilly died,

616
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,690
I woke up in the middle of the night
in a panic.

617
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,166
Rummaged through the whole house,
his whole room...

618
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,688
...looking for anything.

619
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,690
Kid's drawings, schoolwork...

620
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,929
...old pair of tennis shoes.

621
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:45,051
Anything that would keep him alive.

622
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,765
The front hall, under the stairs.

623
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,325
Sir?

624
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,767
The bathroom.

625
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,165
Thanks.

626
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,049
You know,
the suit's not all that bad.

627
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,601
You don't have to hide way out here.

628
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,883
I was, uh, playing hard to get.

629
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,691
But you're already gotten.

630
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,927
So tell me,

631
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,684
how is it that you know
so much about me

632
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,764
and I know nothing about you?

633
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,609
It's this, uh, little row home
my grandmother owned.

634
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,808
Five of us sharing one bathroom.

635
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,531
My dad was a security guard.

636
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,650
Now he has emphysema,
but still smokes.

637
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,610
And I'm pretty sure he's putting it
to the nurse I'm paying for.

638
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,367
When I think of losing him...

639
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,124
Aah...

640
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,645
What about you?

641
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,847
I come from a family where...

642
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,844
...the expectation is so high
that I can't really ever succeed.

643
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,248
It's fine,
it's just that I keep trying.

644
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,010
So...

645
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,810
I'm trying to sleep
my way to the top.

646
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,802
Are we covered?

647
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,443
Come on. Take me home?

648
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,568
Yeah.

649
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,805
Dad?

650
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,326
You got a visitor.

651
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,364
Who are you?

652
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,206
You might want to remove the battery
from your cellular device.

653
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,321
What?

654
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,086
You think 'cause you're not on a call,
they can't hear you?

655
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,490
Agent Gamble.

656
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,247
I'm with the FBI's
Criminal Investigation Division.

657
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,163
We've been looking at the Wyatt Corp
for about five years now.

658
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,566
- I don't work for Wyatt.
- John Moore did.

659
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,121
He was in Wyatt's training program
in '09.

660
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:57,961
Stella Ross, migrated
from Wyatt to Eikon like you.

661
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:02,091
Two months later,
her steering column exploded.

662
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,203
And Richard McAllister...

663
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,010
...whose Ethion work
you drafted off of.

664
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,964
I didn't draft off his work.

665
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,963
A month ago,
you were circling the drain at Wyatt.

666
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,841
Now you're some hotshot exec
over at Eikon? Don't bullshit me.

667
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,968
OK, I think it's time for you to go.

668
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,288
You think Wyatt's gonna fill
your pockets and let you walk?

669
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,965
I don't know what
you're talking about, OK?

670
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,561
Come on, Adam.

671
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,722
How long do you think
you can keep this up?

672
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,610
All it takes is one mistake,
one slip up.

673
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,126
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

674
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,003
Just don't wait till it's too late.

675
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,404
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

676
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,285
You wouldn't understand.

677
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,807
Yeah, I was probably too busy

678
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,691
putting three meals
in front of you every day

679
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,650
and giving you all the love
that parents had.

680
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,122
Come on, Adam.
We had a perfect life.

681
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,085
You know, if your insurance covered
even half of what morn needed...

682
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,601
Don't try to revise death.
What did you want me to do?

683
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,728
I wanted you to fight.

684
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,042
I wanted us to have enough
to at least give her a chance.

685
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,049
You gotta give that up.

686
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,250
These companies steal so much,
there's nothing left to earn.

687
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,880
Yeah, what you're doing
doesn't make it right.

688
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,088
No.

689
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,447
No one can make it right.

690
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,763
So, why shouldn't
I get my share? Huh?

691
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,922
The FBI just walked out of our house.

692
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,367
I don't want to end up like you.

693
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,809
So that's what he's up to.

694
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,204
That's what you wanted.

695
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,328
I'm done now. This isn't who I am.

696
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,280
This is exactly who you are.
Did you frisk him?

697
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,123
You hiding something?

698
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,924
Knock it Off!

699
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,691
You've been a little temperamental
lately, haven't you?

700
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,251
Are you falling for that girl?

701
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,643
- He's falling for Jock.
- All right, all right!

702
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,245
What'd he talk about?

703
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,802
He talked about progress,
enriching people's lives.

704
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,122
Yeah, he talk about his son?

705
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,203
Yeah. A little.

706
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,928
It seem rehearsed?

707
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,161
No.

708
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,403
It did the first time he told it.

709
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,881
That was when the world fell in love
with Jock Goddard,

710
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,168
the grieving father.

711
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:53,571
That story of his little dead boy
saved Eikon.

712
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,609
I got what you asked for, OK?

713
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,205
We had a deal.
I just want my money.

714
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,328
Oh, he wants his money.

715
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,404
We'll keep your money for you.
You'll be doing five to ten upstate.

716
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,324
I got the specs. That was the deal.

717
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,608
Pictures are no good to me.

718
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,770
I need to know what it does, I need
to hold it in my hand and see it run!

719
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,207
Do you understand me?
Put it in my fucking hand!

720
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,362
Or what? I end up like Richard?

721
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,611
Jock builds one prototype.

722
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:32,242
It's assembled in the vault,
piece by piece, until beta trials.

723
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,482
It stays in the vault
on the 38th floor.

724
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,246
Without files, without source code,
you can't do...

725
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,880
No, I don't need his files.

726
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,649
I just need to see his vision.

727
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:47,283
No, I'm not doing this anymore. I'm out.

728
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,245
You're out?
You are only out, my son,

729
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,244
when I say you're out!

730
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,448
I own you right now.

731
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:03,281
You see?
I can get to anyone.

732
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,170
Don't make this harder
than it has to be.

733
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,649
It's just business, Adam.
Everybody steals, everybody lies.

734
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,007
There's no right or wrong.

735
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,964
There's just winning or losing.

736
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:30,087
<i>Now the first order of business
is lifting Emma's fingerprints.</i>

737
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,571
So my parents
are having this thing

738
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,525
for my brother's engagement
this weekend.

739
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,087
You wanna go with me?

740
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,484
To meet your parents?

741
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,449
It's just dinner and drinks.

742
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,329
You, uh...

743
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,962
You sure I'm relationship material?

744
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,649
You know what? It's...
It's actually gonna be really boring.

745
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,451
- Probably better if you don't.
- Hey.

746
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,168
Of course I will.

747
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,288
Even if it is boring?

748
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,801
Yeah, even if it's boring.

749
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,965
Hey, what happened to you?

750
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,288
Kev!
What are you doing here?

751
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,363
What do you think
I'm doing here?

752
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,329
Your interview. Right.

753
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,005
<i>Uh...</i>

754
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,123
- How'd it go? I spoke to HR.
- No, you didn't.

755
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,485
I'm sorry, man. I, uh...

756
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,363
I've been under a ton of pressure.
I completely forgot...

757
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,729
Yeah, I understand, man. Your new
apartment, new car, new girlfriend.

758
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,370
You have no idea
what I'm dealing with.

759
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:08,530
No, I don't.
And I don't think I ever will.

760
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,887
- Thanks.
- Come on, Kev. I'm sorry, man.

761
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,201
Kev!

762
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,243
Mr. Goddard wants to see you.

763
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,525
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I understand that.

764
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,643
Wyatt has to consider our offer.
He has no choice.

765
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,451
I mean, he's tap dancing
on the Titanic.

766
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,080
Come on in.

767
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,526
Look, somebody just walked in.

768
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,409
I've got something
I've got to deal with.

769
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,449
All right. Thanks.

770
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,005
Don't forget, you have
a lunch reservation at the club.

771
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,450
Come on. Let's take a drive.
I'll buy you lunch.

772
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,406
Got some interesting news
this morning concerning you.

773
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:50,571
Thought I'd make sure it was true
before I talk to you about it.

774
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:55,127
- Is everything all right?
- You tell me.

775
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:59,928
The DOD has given us
preliminary funding for Type X.

776
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,444
- We'll leave it here, Mr. Goddard.
- Thanks, Bud.

777
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,444
- Well, what do you think?
- It's powerful.

778
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,001
Yeah, it is.

779
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,447
Consider it a loaner
for saving Type X.

780
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,444
- Jock, I couldn't.
- Yeah, you could.

781
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:27,008
Power is the juice,
get used to drinking it.

782
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,009
I heard you talking
about Occura.

783
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,605
There's a lot of buzz about it.

784
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,730
Yeah, Occura's been,
uh, gestating

785
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,805
for... quite a few years.

786
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,486
We only recently were able to put

787
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,166
all of the elements together
to make it happen.

788
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,890
- I'll have coffee.
- I'll have a water.

789
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,121
Very good.

790
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,489
Imagine walking around
with nothing but your cell phone.

791
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,961
No wallet, no keys.

792
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,929
Like a digital wallet.

793
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,367
It'll be your driver's license,
it'll be your credit card,

794
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,487
it'll be more than that.

795
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,645
Super slim. Foldable, with a battery
that recharges itself

796
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,491
from any ambient electrical source.

797
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,650
It'll know where you've been,
who you've been with.

798
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:12,691
It'll track your priorities,
expenditures,

799
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,844
your health, calendar.

800
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,925
It will know who you are.
And it's all ours.

801
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,481
You think people really want
all that personal information

802
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,801
under one roof?

803
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,009
It's not the roof that matters, Adam.

804
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:31,444
It's the warm fuzzy feeling
of the home under it.

805
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:35,127
People are so distracted these days,
they don't know who they are.

806
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,520
But we will.

807
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,650
We'll know them better
than they know themselves.

808
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,528
Oh, my goodness.

809
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,607
Jock.

810
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,250
Nick.

811
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,010
How long has it been?

812
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,923
Not long enough.

813
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,686
You look like
you're holding up all right.

814
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,083
Oh, I'm doing fine.
What brings you here?

815
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,681
Lunch. Lunch brings me here.

816
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,563
- You remember Judith.
- Oh, of course.

817
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,643
- How are you, Judith?
- Good.

818
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,565
You remember Adam Cassidy.
He designed your Ethion.

819
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,927
Yes, he did.

820
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,683
Hello, again, Adam.

821
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,569
He reminds me of you.

822
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,206
Way back when,
before you walked out on us.

823
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,725
Let's not muddle the facts.

824
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,644
You asked me to walk
and locked the door behind me.

825
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,531
Besides, I was smarter than Adam here.

826
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,682
And I didn't spend all my time
kissing your ass.

827
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:44,609
How is Ethion? We've heard
remarkably little about it.

828
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,923
Mm. Ethion's fine.
How's Occura?

829
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,003
Right on schedule.

830
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,851
And it's something you're
never going to be able to duplicate.

831
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,729
Is that so?

832
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,209
Remember when we used
to share ideas, Nick?

833
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,600
I try not to.

834
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:04,606
When we put our heads together,
there was no problem we couldn't solve.

835
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,404
Nothing we couldn't make.

836
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,608
There was no problem I couldn't solve.

837
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,643
Nothing I couldn't make.

838
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,448
I miss your friendship.

839
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,405
Why don't we sit down together sometime.

840
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,967
Always so full of shit.
You sit here like...

841
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,566
...like some big shot
with boy wonder here,

842
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,644
blowing smoke up your ass
like it's still relevant.

843
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,280
The truth is, I'm gonna bury you,

844
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:35,967
and your boy here
is gonna be working for me again.

845
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:40,006
Because working for you,
means he'll be working for me.

846
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,125
Don't let your lunch get cold, Nick.

847
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,922
Nice seeing you, Judith.

848
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:18,207
He's running
search after search on Goddard.

849
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,243
What is he looking for?

850
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,811
I don't know.

851
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,605
I think this
boy's gone soft on us.

852
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,846
<i>Were you going to ignore my call?</i>

853
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,322
You should have told me
Wyatt was gonna be there.

854
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,721
<i>Why do you keep pacing so much?
You look nervous.</i>

855
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,609
<i>You have something you want to tell me?</i>

856
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,651
Where are you?

857
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,723
<i>Now let me explain to you
how this is going to work.</i>

858
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,729
We hit one of your friends first.

859
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,729
<i>Or maybe the girl.</i>

860
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,002
If you even touch her...

861
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,891
Then get us what we need.

862
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,731
<i>You have two days
to break into Eikon.</i>

863
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:35,969
<i>This is your last warning.</i>

864
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:48,207
Help! Help me! Somebody help me!

865
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:57,005
He said I had two days.
That was the night before last.

866
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:00,926
These people are everywhere.
Put cameras in your house.

867
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,564
I'm sorry. I just...

868
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,003
I messed up, Dad.

869
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,047
I thought I knew what I was doing.

870
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,321
You have to figure a way out.

871
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,441
Adam.

872
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,087
Adam.

873
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,891
- Adam!
- This is serious, OK?

874
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,444
You got to figure a way out.

875
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,290
It's not that easy.

876
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:46,081
OK? I put a lot of people
I care about in danger.

877
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:57,081
Adam, I think
the FBI is the only option.

878
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,928
I could go to jail.

879
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:09,490
Or they could kill you.

880
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,568
<i>There was a black car and it
just came out of nowhere and it hit him.</i>

881
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,728
Slow down. Is he all right?
Where are you?

882
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:58,521
<i>I've been trying to reach you all day.
Kev's at the hospital, but he's OK.</i>

883
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,330
<i>I think they're discharging us now.</i>

884
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,608
OK, were there witnesses?
Did anyone get the plates?

885
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,770
<i>I don't think so. I don't know, it just
all happened so fast. I got to go.</i>

886
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,922
- OK, call me back.
- <i>I will.</i>

887
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,401
Hey!

888
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,969
Hey! What's the matter with you?!

889
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,248
Go, go, go, go!

890
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,525
On your knees.

891
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,081
- I'll do it, I'll do it!
- Get on your knees!

892
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:45,962
You're going in tonight, and you'll need
Emma's phone to do it.

893
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,285
Get moving.

894
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,287
Can I come in?

895
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,405
I haven't been honest with you.

896
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,131
What do you mean?

897
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:20,041
There's things I want to tell you
that I haven't told you.

898
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,845
What is it?

899
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,406
Mr. Cassidy.

900
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:59,722
- Yeah?
- Working late tonight?

901
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,044
Burning that midnight oil.

902
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,121
Adam?

903
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,370
I've lost floors one through five.

904
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,841
We've got security lights
in sector two.

905
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,490
<i>Hold your position.</i>

906
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,728
Get our IT guy on the line.

907
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,524
Before we move on to sector three,
let's check that server.

908
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,248
I want the list
of everyone in the building.

909
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,041
Control...

910
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,402
- I'm only showing one exec present.
- Who is it?

911
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,527
Adam Cassidy.

912
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,046
Oh, come on.

913
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:34,167
<i>Hi, it's Emma. Leave a message.</i>

914
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,841
Marty, go check on Adam Cassidy.

915
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,609
Roger, I'm en route. Come on!

916
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,763
<i>Adam Cassidy is not in his office.</i>

917
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,126
Shit.

918
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:32,606
All hands on, get this guy!
Use any means necessary.

919
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:41,841
Clear.

920
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,606
Mr. Cassidy!

921
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,204
We've got somebody at the vault.

922
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,491
What the hell?

923
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:15,521
Jock.

924
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,610
Mr. Cassidy.

925
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:22,445
Got caught with your hand
in the cookie jar, didn't you?

926
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:27,610
I... Jock, I can explain this.

927
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,531
Where you gonna start?

928
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:33,291
I was beginning to think
it would never happen.

929
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:38,890
Wyatt would rather watch
his company crumble than sell it to me.

930
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,811
Then you came along
with your blind ambition.

931
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,480
We recorded it all, every conversation,

932
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,921
every text between you and Wyatt.

933
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:54,681
You tell Nick he'll be selling me
majority shares in his company

934
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:57,730
or evidence of your collusion goes
to the FBI.

935
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,162
You manipulated me.

936
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,049
Yes.

937
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:09,524
You'll be at the Sutton Club tomorrow
at noon. You, Nick, and me.

938
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:13,728
Nobody else.
No lawyers, no handlers. Nobody.

939
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,245
Let him out!

940
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,329
Big mistake.

941
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,644
Yeah.

942
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,083
What are you doing here?
You can't be here.

943
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,600
You used me.

944
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,445
I'm sorry. OK? I'm so sorry.

945
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,285
You got to go,
you're not safe here.

946
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,761
Everything you...
everything you said,

947
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:26,164
every... everything you did...
was a lie.

948
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,402
No, that's not true.
Not everything.

949
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,042
I wanted to be someone else.

950
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,121
Now you are.

951
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,564
Now you are.

952
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,802
You know...

953
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:54,764
I fell for you because
you weren't like everyone else.

954
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:03,443
Emma, I'm gonna make this right.

955
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,962
You don't know what that is.

956
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,890
Well, you sure messed that up.

957
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,644
Hey, look, I'm trying, OK?

958
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:38,327
Yeah, well, now you're done trying.
Let's go for a ride.

959
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,243
Look, you don't get it, OK?
It was all a setup!

960
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,970
- Get in the car!
- It was all a setup!

961
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:25,485
I'm sorry, man.

962
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,321
What are you sorry for?

963
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,323
You didn't run me over, did you?

964
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,124
I'm the reason for all of this.

965
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,729
The real question is...

966
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,242
...what are we gonna do about it?

967
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,322
I'm going to use what they taught <i>me...</i>

968
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,848
...to destroy what they built.

969
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,807
So, what's the news
on the Dutch deal?

970
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,082
- I don't know.
- Good, we won't need them anyway.

971
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,088
Don't remember inviting you.

972
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:25,091
My going-away party got
this whole thing rolling.

973
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,964
I thought it was only fair
that I show up for yours.

974
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,729
What are you talking about?

975
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,087
Goddard orchestrated this whole thing...

976
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,968
...to entrap you
into committing a crime.

977
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:44,684
I didn't commit a crime.

978
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,366
You did.

979
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,083
This is the death of your empire, Nick.

980
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:53,971
And you were funded
with money I never touched,

981
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:57,522
by corporations I had never heard of.
He has nothing.

982
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:59,523
He has everything.

983
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:03,890
<i>E-mails, texts.</i>
<i>He got the break-in on camera.</i>

984
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:07,411
<i>All the dots connect back to you.</i>
<i>The whole thing was</i> a <i>setup.</i>

985
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,050
What's going on?
What's going on?

986
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:13,808
- We had good intel on this!
- Where did you get that intel, Nick?

987
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,770
This is absurd.

988
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,850
You can't just...

989
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,081
Hamilton.

990
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:52,842
Jack's hometown.

991
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,006
Nick...

992
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:14,846
Meachum.

993
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:31,844
That's one down.

994
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,240
One more to go.

995
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,808
Whatever you have better be good.

996
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:50,088
If it works, we both walk away
with an insurance policy

997
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:52,123
no amount of money can buy.

998
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:54,567
Yeah, but if it doesn't?

999
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:14,246
Get out your phones. Sit down.
Put the batteries on the table.

1000
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:43,242
It says you've got another phone.

1001
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,727
- Oh, no, no.
- What happened?

1002
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,325
I lost the signal.
Both phones, they're gone.

1003
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:14,641
Can you get it back?

1004
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:24,687
- You'll pay for this.
- Yeah, I'll pay.

1005
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:30,644
I'm buying every goddamn share
of Wyatt Corporation's stock you own,

1006
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:33,161
and I'm paying
40 cents on the dollar.

1007
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:36,285
How does that sound?

1008
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,722
I get it or the Feds do.

1009
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:48,201
- You'll never get away with this.
- Shut up, Adam.

1010
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:51,882
You're nothing but a convenient tool,
an empty vessel.

1011
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:53,326
I filled you with piss and vinegar

1012
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:57,007
and told you it was champagne
and you lapped it up.

1013
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,406
- I'm not signing this.
- Then you'll go to jail.

1014
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:05,684
With what? What have you got?!

1015
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,365
Ah...

1016
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,324
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1017
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:12,127
What?

1018
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:14,965
- Sign it!
- You have taken credit for everything.

1019
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:18,886
And you've created nothing!
You arrogant bastard!

1020
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:22,245
I took a brick device
that everybody laughed at

1021
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:26,246
and turned it into the one thing
that no one can do without.

1022
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:28,169
I earned my arrogance!

1023
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:32,285
Yes, and none of that happens
without me! You stood on my shoulders!

1024
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:34,568
And now I'm standing on your neck!

1025
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:38,611
I'm 15 moves ahead of you, Nick.

1026
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:41,286
The Dutch offer, me!

1027
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:46,731
I strung you along
until the only hope was... Adam.

1028
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:52,283
That's impossible.

1029
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:53,885
Impossible?

1030
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:57,010
I built Wyatt Corp.

1031
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:00,767
Sell or not, your company is finished.

1032
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:03,969
You've got nothing in the pipe,
and even if you did,

1033
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:07,488
you've got no money to market it with.

1034
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:11,281
Forty cents on the dollar is
a lot better than jail.

1035
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:12,845
You make the choice.

1036
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,326
Now get out.

1037
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:43,403
He likes to eat his young.

1038
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:47,489
They're mine to eat.

1039
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:09,411
It's time to go back
to your sad little life.

1040
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:11,531
Why go to all the trouble?

1041
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:15,571
<i>Because I wanted
to see him bleed. Go.</i>

1042
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:18,371
No. There's more to it,
you wouldn't risk it all just for that.

1043
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:22,809
I told you, Adam,
competition breeds innovation.

1044
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,361
With his name on the door,
he developed his ass off.

1045
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,369
You needed him.

1046
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:29,722
You needed his mind
because he was smarter than you.

1047
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:32,526
He made a great processor
and a shitty phone

1048
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:35,524
and he served a purpose,
just like you did. Go.

1049
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,004
You're nothing without him.

1050
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:43,723
Occura is real.
It'll do everything I said it would.

1051
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,688
I just needed his processor to run it.

1052
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,289
- Who is this?
<i>- Mr. Goddard?</i>

1053
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:04,329
<i>Who is this?</i>

1054
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,000
You should really trash your e-mails
when you're done reading them.

1055
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,090
I sent you all an e-mail
this morning

1056
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:16,124
in which I encoded 3DPS-like data
to identify you.

1057
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:22,762
Someone is always listening, Jock.

1058
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:24,445
Always.

1059
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:54,681
Mr. Goddard.

1060
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:56,524
Mr. Goddard, you're under arrest.

1061
01:33:56,680 --> 01:34:00,207
I'm gonna make your life a living hell.

1062
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,289
Please stand,
place your hands behind your back.

1063
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:05,608
Yes! We got him.

1064
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:10,286
You did the right thing, kid.

1065
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:12,283
The charges against you
include felony fraud,

1066
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:17,002
industrial espionage,
obstruction of justice, insider trading.

1067
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:20,369
Augustine Goddard,
you have the right to remain silent.

1068
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:23,444
Anything you say can
and will be used in a court of law.

1069
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:26,483
<i>You have the right to an attorney.</i>

1070
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:30,401
If you cannot afford an attorney,
the court will appoint one for you.

1071
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,762
Do you understand these rights
as I have read them to you?

1072
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,922
<i>I handed the Feds Wyatt and Goddard.</i>

1073
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:46,286
<i>They won't be seeing light
for a very long time.</i>

1074
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:50,285
<i>Judith and Meachum got
what they deserved too.</i>

1075
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:55,524
<i>As for me, I got lucky.</i>

1076
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:58,206
<i>The Feds cut me a break
for my cooperation.</i>

1077
01:34:58,680 --> 01:34:59,647
No...

1078
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:12,088
<i>The things I thought I wanted
don't seem so important anymore.</i>

1079
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:15,685
<i>I do know right from wrong, and...</i>

1080
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:20,131
<i>...I'm sorry it took me
so long to act on it.</i>

1081
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:25,009
<i>I just want you to know that</i>

1082
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:27,401
<i>I never wanted to do any
of this to you.</i>

1083
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,402
<i>I hope one day I can
make things right.</i>

1084
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:39,680
<i>I'm sorry, Emma.</i>

1085
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:52,966
Thanks.

1086
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:56,842
Go, go, go, go!
Go! Go! Go!

1087
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:58,923
Run, run!

1088
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:06,567
What?

1089
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:12,411
Did I ever tell you, you were right?

1090
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,125
About what?

1091
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:17,491
Everything.

1092
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:23,244
I mean that.

1093
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:25,289
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.

1094
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:43,083
How's it going with that girl?

1095
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:46,971
Well, she won't talk to me.

1096
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:50,762
It ain't over till it's over.

1097
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:55,561
You know how long it took me
to get a date with your mother?

1098
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:57,760
How long?

1099
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:02,762
A long time.

1100
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:08,123
And I was much better-looking then
than you are now.

1101
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:11,090
- Oh, is that right?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1102
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:22,489
Where you going?
The subway is this way.

1103
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:24,927
I got a faster ride. Come on.

1104
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,683
I thought we were done
with this shit?

1105
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,808
It's a rental, Dad.
I got it for the day.

1106
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:38,964
Oh, yeah?
Well, then, let's have some fun.

1107
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:42,845
<i>One way to remember who you are...</i>

1108
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,407
How do you open this thing?

1109
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:47,847
<i>...is to remember who your heroes are.</i>

1110
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:02,283
<i>I'm doing things my way now.</i>

1111
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:05,165
<i>Building from the ground up.</i>

1112
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:07,482
<i>There are no shortcuts.</i>

1113
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:09,804
Oh my God,
what are you doing?

1114
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:12,122
- What? I messed it up.
- We have a lot of things to do.

1115
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:13,970
- Come on!
- All right, Jesus!

1116
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:19,120
Hi. Emma Jennings.

1117
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:21,044
One second.

1118
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:25,607
Adam, you have a visitor.

1119
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,326
Hey.

1120
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,365
Hi.

1121
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:47,165
Nice place you have here.

1122
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:49,243
I mean, for Brooklyn.

1123
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:53,168
I'm glad you came.

1124
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:56,967
Kept getting e-mails about a job offer
at a brand-new startup company.

1125
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,404
Why I didn't see that coming...

1126
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:03,723
Yeah, we, uh...

1127
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:06,281
We really need you here.

1128
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,450
You couldn't afford me.

1129
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:10,921
Lots of stock options.

1130
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:16,082
You have to do better than that.

1131
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,405
OK.

1132
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:27,921
I need you here.

1133
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:40,930
I'll think about it.

1134
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:53,846
Come on,
let me buy you a drink.

1135
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,843
You said you had a thing
for bridge-and-tunnel.

1136
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,128
Your words. Emma.

1137
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:03,725
Can I at least thank you
for considering my offer?

1138
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:31,006
Thank you.

1139
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:37,561
<i>I like being across the bridge.</i>

1140
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:41,887
<i>Over here, it feels like home.</i>
