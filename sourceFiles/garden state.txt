00:01:28,454 --> 00:01:31,574
Hello?

6
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:35,709
Look. you don't call me back.
so I don't know how to do this.

7
00:01:37,963 --> 00:01:40,420
If you're not gonna return my calls.

8
00:01:40,508 --> 00:01:43,213
then there's no way
for us to communicate.

9
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:47,177
Look. I don't know how to do this.

10
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:50,267
You're gonna need to come home now .

11
00:01:50,352 --> 00:01:52,345
Last night...

12
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:56,024
Your mother died last night. Andrew .

13
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:58,861
She drowned.

14
00:01:58,945 --> 00:02:01,401
Last night. she drowned in the bath.

Bones. sinking like stones.

Homes. places we've grown.

Yeah we do. yeah we do

19
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:46,319
We live in a beautiful world

20
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,796
Bones. sinking like stones.
all that we fought for

21
00:02:57,968 --> 00:03:02,180
And homes. places we've grown.
all of us are done for...

00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,056
more than a spot

25
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:13,517
They want your job. This cannot happen
again. This will never happen again.

26
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,567
You have two tables,
you are 30 minutes late,

27
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:18,062

your job will go to...

28
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:20,910

29
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:31,124

36
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:51,852
We don't have bread.

37
00:03:51,944 --> 00:03:54,566
What do you mean?
How can you not have bread?

38
00:03:54,655 --> 00:03:58,191
Uh, we're a Vietnamese restaurant.
We just don't have bread.

39
00:03:58,284 --> 00:04:00,324
Well, you're not Vietnamese.

40
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:03,287
No, l'm not.

41
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:08,078
Can l have something to chew on?
Fuck, bamboo. Whatever.

42
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:10,246

00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:42,244
Thanks for the time

46
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,785
That you've given me

47
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:51,882
The memories are all in my mind

48
00:04:51,968 --> 00:04:54,756
And now that we've come

49
00:04:54,847 --> 00:04:58,430
To the end of our rainbow

50
00:04:58,517 --> 00:05:04,771
There's something l must say out loud

51
00:05:04,858 --> 00:05:08,690
Yes, you're once, twice

52
00:05:08,778 --> 00:05:12,646
Three times a lady

53
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:17,950
l love you

54
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:21,573
Yes, you're once, twice

55
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:24,622
Three times a lady

56
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:30,544
l love you

57
00:05:30,636 --> 00:05:36,888
l love you

58
00:05:42,691 --> 00:05:46,143
Shit, yo.

59
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:49,487
- Holy shit!
- What's up, man?

60
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:51,697
Largeman, what are you doing here?

61
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:55,403
Uh... that's my mom.

62
00:05:55,497 --> 00:05:58,248
- Fuck.
- Aw, fuck.

63
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:02,835
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

64
00:06:02,921 --> 00:06:06,337
So... welcome back home.

65
00:06:06,425 --> 00:06:08,169
Thanks.

66
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,549
So, what have you been doin'?

67
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:14,174
- You still acting and shit, right?
- Yeah.

68
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:16,177
- ln L.A., right?
- Yeah.

69
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,140
That's cool.
l hear that place is, like, fucking crazy.

70
00:06:19,231 --> 00:06:22,932
My cousin's a writer out there.
He says that place is, like, mad crazy.

71
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:26,028
He's, like, writing a movie
about snowboarders or some shit.

72
00:06:26,114 --> 00:06:29,032
l don't, l don't know. Um...

73
00:06:29,117 --> 00:06:32,949
l should introduce you to him, Largeman.
Maybe you could do something together.

74
00:06:33,037 --> 00:06:35,078
Yeah, definitely.

75
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:38,250
What are you doing tonight, man?

76
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:40,542
Uh... nothin', you know.

77
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,833
You know, no real plans.
Just in town for a couple of days, so...

78
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:48,386
You should come out with us. We're
gonna go over to the Gleasons' house.

79
00:06:48,472 --> 00:06:52,055
They're having some...
fucking huge party or something.

80
00:06:52,142 --> 00:06:55,060
- Supposedly.
- Well, yeah, supposedly.

81
00:06:55,145 --> 00:06:57,720
- Really?
- He lives up on the hill.

82
00:06:57,816 --> 00:07:00,022
We'll probably go over there
after we bury your mom.

83
00:07:00,109 --> 00:07:04,238
- Well, l got to shower.
- Same.

84
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:08,736
Do you know your mother
redid the hallway bathroom?

85
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,821
What? l'm sorry, what?

86
00:07:10,913 --> 00:07:13,997
Since l met her, she never
showed an interest in anything.

87
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,159
All of a sudden,
a month ago, she wakes up,

88
00:07:16,252 --> 00:07:18,957
she wants to redecorate her bathroom.

89
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:21,254
l helped her.

90
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:25,090
- Oh, must have been fun.
- Well, l sew.

91
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:29,721
l made you something.
lt's a shirt.

92
00:07:29,808 --> 00:07:34,056
That's-That's good.
Thank you.

93
00:07:34,147 --> 00:07:36,270
Will you try it on now?

94
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,530
- Now?
- Well, in case l have to fix it

95
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:45,196
before you leave again, and we
don't see you for another nine years.

96
00:07:45,284 --> 00:07:47,324
l want to make sure it fits.

97
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:50,116
Oh, OK.

98
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:53,077
You're gonna love the material.

99
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:57,379
l used the leftovers
from your mother's design. Gorgeous.

100
00:08:14,732 --> 00:08:15,847
Hi.

101
00:08:18,404 --> 00:08:19,898
Hello.

102
00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:22,315
How you doin'?

103
00:08:22,408 --> 00:08:25,325
''Well, besides that, Mrs. Lincoln,
how was the show?''

104
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:29,030
You know, l'm not really sure
what to say here, Dad, so l'm sorry.

105
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:31,532
Hmm.

106
00:08:31,627 --> 00:08:35,494
How are you?

107
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:40,548
l'm OK. l've been getting these
really bad headaches, though.

108
00:08:40,637 --> 00:08:43,342
Um... they're really quick.

109
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:46,883
lt's like a, like just a little
lightening storm in my head.

110
00:08:46,977 --> 00:08:49,894
Just for a second, and then it's gone.

111
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,065
l just thought maybe you could help me
get that checked out while l'm home.

112
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,190
Go see Dr. Cohen
first thing in the morning.

113
00:08:55,277 --> 00:08:57,851
He's a neurologist in my building.
l-l'll call him.

114
00:08:57,947 --> 00:09:00,782
He'll fit you in.
l'm sure it's nothing to worry about.

115
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:08,992
- Place looks good.
- Oh, that's nice.

116
00:09:09,084 --> 00:09:11,041
Yeah, we've been doing
a lot of work on it.

117
00:09:11,128 --> 00:09:13,205
Really?

118
00:09:15,675 --> 00:09:18,961
Actually, no.
l don't know why l just said that.

119
00:09:19,054 --> 00:09:21,544
Someone redid the hallway bathroom.
l saw that.

120
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:24,891
Yeah, that's new.

121
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:30,730
l'm glad you're here.

122
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:36,154
Saying goodbye is important.

123
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:42,610
l'm glad you could fit it in.

124
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:17,736
I think I'll go home and mull this over

125
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:22,454
Before I cram it down my throat

126
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,032
At long last it's crashed

127
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:27,534
Its colossal mass

128
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:32,457
Has broken up into bits in my moat

129
00:10:34,136 --> 00:10:37,007
Lift the mattress off the floor

130
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:44,305
Walk the cramps off.
go meander in the cold

131
00:10:44,398 --> 00:10:46,971
Hail to your dark skin

132
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:49,475
Hiding the fact you're dead again

133
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:55,110
Underneath the power lines
seeking shade...

134
00:10:55,202 --> 00:10:57,491
- Put your hands on your head, please!
- What?

135
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:02,656
l said, put your motherfucking hands
on you head... please.

136
00:11:02,751 --> 00:11:07,248
82 in a 25. What are you gonna tell me,
you're late or you're just tired?

137
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,131
- l was--
- Shut the fuck up!

138
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:17,095
- Largeman!
- Kenny?

139
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:19,509
Holy shit!

140
00:11:19,603 --> 00:11:21,228
Oh, man! How you doin?

141
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,271
l'm... l'm great!

142
00:11:23,357 --> 00:11:25,765
- You're mom just died!
- l know!

143
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,692
- l mean, that's why you're home.
- Yeah, yep.

144
00:11:29,781 --> 00:11:33,826
- You're a cop, Kenny?
- Yeah. l know, l know.

145
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,654
Why?

146
00:11:35,746 --> 00:11:38,201
l don't know.
Couldn't think of anything better to do.

147
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,376
No, but it's really cool, though, man.
People really listen to you.

148
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:44,247
l mean... they have to!

149
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:46,580
Yo, and check this shit out.
That's the safety.

150
00:11:46,674 --> 00:11:49,000
- Oh, cool.
- And plus, the benefits, man.

151
00:11:49,093 --> 00:11:52,131
lf l get shot, l'm like, mmm! Rich!

152
00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:55,806
But Kenny, the last time l saw you,
you were doing coke lines off a urinal.

153
00:11:55,893 --> 00:11:57,222
La-la-la-la

154
00:11:57,312 --> 00:11:59,303
No, l had to grow up, man.
lt's time to grow up.

155
00:11:59,396 --> 00:12:01,685
Plus, l wasn't making shit
in that fish market.

156
00:12:01,774 --> 00:12:04,231
No, no one knew who l was.
Couldn't get laid.

157
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:07,735
lt's a much better situation for me, man.

158
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:11,239
Speaking of which, um...

159
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:14,031
- ...how'd l do?
- What do you mean?

160
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,280
l don't know.
You know, just the whole...

161
00:12:16,374 --> 00:12:18,616
You mean, like... as a cop?

162
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,201
Yeah, the whole, ''Shut the fuck up!''

163
00:12:21,296 --> 00:12:24,546
Well, l thought you were a dick,
so l guess that's good.

164
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:27,800
Nice!
So, what the fuck, man?

165
00:12:27,886 --> 00:12:30,757
You're this huge movie star now?
l heard you did some...

166
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:33,006
You played a big football player?
l didn't see it.

167
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,429
Oh, yeah, just this thing.

168
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:37,306
- Fucking De Niro and shit!
- What?

169
00:12:37,398 --> 00:12:38,940
- He's awesome.
- Yeah.

170
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,063
- Deer Hunter ?
- Yeah.

171
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:43,938
Man... we should sit down.
We should talk,

172
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:48,656
because l've got some really good ideas
for movies. You could play me and shit!

173
00:12:48,743 --> 00:12:52,029
Stories From the Force.

174
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:54,363
Yeah, definitely.
That sounds good.

175
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:19,809
- Holy shit!
- Hi, what's up?

176
00:13:19,902 --> 00:13:22,310
- How you doin', man?
- Good. How you doin', man?

177
00:13:22,405 --> 00:13:24,978
- How you doin?
- Get this guy a beer. Give him your beer.

178
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:27,910
This guy does not wait for a beer.
He's a movie star!

179
00:13:27,994 --> 00:13:30,402
He's like, Jersey's De Niro and shit.

180
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,747
Largeman, man,
what are you doing home?

181
00:13:35,086 --> 00:13:37,208
- l, uh...
- Press junket.

182
00:13:38,547 --> 00:13:41,038
Oh, that's phat, yo!
Fuck, yeah!

183
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:44,549
Serpico and shit! ''Attica!''

184
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:46,465
Shut the fuck up, man.

185
00:13:49,101 --> 00:13:51,591
You like that?

186
00:13:51,686 --> 00:13:54,391
Like ''press junket''?

187
00:13:54,481 --> 00:13:56,854
That's improv, bitch.
You can use it.

188
00:13:56,943 --> 00:13:59,481
All right? OK.
Let me show you something.

189
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:07,157
Largeman! Whoa, whoa.

190
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:09,488
What's goin' on, man?

191
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,658
How you been, man? Hey!

192
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:14,040
- Jess, how are you, bro?
- Whoa! How's it goin', man?

193
00:14:14,128 --> 00:14:17,414
What's goin' on, man? l haven't seen you
in so long. l heard you're kickin' ass.

194
00:14:17,507 --> 00:14:21,007
Oh, basically the man
bought my silent Velcro patent.

195
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:23,550
- What?
- l developed this little item.

196
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:28,764
lt's just like Velcro, but it doesn't
make that... the Velcro noise.

197
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:31,641
- So, how much did they buy it for?
- A lot, man!

198
00:14:31,732 --> 00:14:34,648
Wow. So, what are you
doing with yourself?

199
00:14:34,734 --> 00:14:36,691
Um, yeah, nothing. Nothing.

200
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:38,771
l've never been so bored in my whole life.

201
00:14:38,863 --> 00:14:42,030
First month, l went out, you know.
l bought a whole bunch of shit.

202
00:14:42,117 --> 00:14:43,945
But, you know-- Nothing.

203
00:14:46,122 --> 00:14:48,659
Someone got a joint for me?

204
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,611
Mmm.

205
00:15:20,701 --> 00:15:23,157
Here you go.

206
00:15:23,246 --> 00:15:25,618
Ugh. No thanks, man.

207
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:29,124
Really? l thought you're
a big movie star and shit.

208
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:32,081
- Nah.
- Well, then, here.

209
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:34,663
Eat this.

210
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:36,965
Welcome home.

211
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:50,479
Guess l'll see you guys later.

212
00:15:53,404 --> 00:15:55,231
Should we play a game?

213
00:15:55,323 --> 00:15:58,324
Let's play ''Spin the Bottle.''

214
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,529
l'm not playing ''Spin the Bottle.''
How old are we?

215
00:16:01,621 --> 00:16:03,614
More importantly, how old are they?

216
00:16:03,707 --> 00:16:06,874
Oh, they're all legal... l think.

217
00:16:06,961 --> 00:16:09,333
Well, we just ate all this fuckin' X,

218
00:16:09,422 --> 00:16:12,127
so... what the hell else
are we supposed to do?

219
00:16:12,216 --> 00:16:14,209
Girl has a point.

220
00:16:14,302 --> 00:16:16,378
Fuckin' right.

221
00:16:16,471 --> 00:16:18,511
l'm in!

222
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:31,187
Wait in line

223
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,399
Till your time

224
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,528
Ticking clock

225
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,158
Everyone stop

226
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:43,201
Everyone's saying
different things to me

227
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:45,498
Different things to me

228
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:52,628
Do you believe in what you see?

229
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:59,133
There doesn't seem to be anybody else
who agrees with me

230
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:04,767
Do you believe in what you see?

231
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,894
Motionless wheel

232
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:10,940
Nothing is real

233
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:15,777
Do you believe in what you see?

234
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,456
And I'll hide away for another day

235
00:17:23,545 --> 00:17:25,502
Large!

236
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:30,418
Large!

237
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,972
Largeman, this is Dana.

238
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:42,390
- Hi.
- Hi. Who's up?

239
00:18:20,775 --> 00:18:22,233
This is gonna be a good night.

240
00:18:22,317 --> 00:18:27,774
Do you believe in what you see?

241
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:30,737
Everyone's saying
different things to me

242
00:18:30,828 --> 00:18:33,829
Different things to me

243
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:37,164
Everyone's saying
different things to me

244
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,788
Different things to me

245
00:18:39,878 --> 00:18:42,880
Everyone's saying
different things to me

246
00:18:42,966 --> 00:18:45,883
Different things to me

247
00:18:45,969 --> 00:18:49,006
Everyone's saying
different things to me

248
00:18:49,097 --> 00:18:51,173
Different things to me

249
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,861
lt's good, isn't it?

250
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:48,952
l always try to save a couple of
the marshmallows till the very end,

251
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:50,912
but l never make it.

252
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:55,578
l always end up with...
bunch of flake things and pink milk.

253
00:19:56,838 --> 00:19:58,961
My mind wanders.

254
00:20:02,303 --> 00:20:04,972
So, Tim...

255
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:07,428
...how long have you been
working at Medieval Times?

256
00:20:07,517 --> 00:20:11,135
Three years, but l've only
been a knight for two.

257
00:20:11,229 --> 00:20:13,223
You have to pay your dues.

258
00:20:13,315 --> 00:20:16,434
l worked in the stables
and helped in the kitchen.

259
00:20:16,526 --> 00:20:18,982
When l started,
he was making the coleslaw.

260
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,945
Hasn't been the same
since you got knighted.

261
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:23,191
l really just stirred it.

262
00:20:23,285 --> 00:20:25,277
Don't be modest!

263
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,826
Mr. Modesty won the joust last night.

264
00:20:27,915 --> 00:20:31,330
- Congratulations.
- lt's not that big a deal. lt's fixed.

265
00:20:32,961 --> 00:20:35,287
What was it that happened
to you in high school?

266
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:37,290
You had a thing.
l forgot what it was.

267
00:20:37,383 --> 00:20:39,756
- He got the shit kicked out of him.
- No, he didn't.

268
00:20:39,844 --> 00:20:43,509
How do you know? He got the shit
kicked out of him by Tyrell Freeman.

269
00:20:43,597 --> 00:20:46,386
- l fucked him up, too.
- He knocked your teeth out.

270
00:20:46,476 --> 00:20:48,718
He only chipped one tooth.

271
00:20:51,106 --> 00:20:55,567
So, what are you up to now, Mark?
You're digging graves?

272
00:21:00,074 --> 00:21:02,151
Mark's gettin' into real estate.

273
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:09,919
- Tim can speak Klingon.
- What?

274
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:11,911
- No, l can't .
-Yes, you can.

275
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,210
- What the fuck is Klingon?
- Like the Star Trek guys?

276
00:21:14,298 --> 00:21:16,754
- Yeah, he can speak their language!
- No, she's kidding.

277
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:19,250
No, l'm not.
Why are you being shy?

278
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:22,098
- Yeah, don't be shy, Tim.
- lt's just, it's made up.

279
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:24,756
This guy who plays the wizard
at work is a Trekkie. l don't--

280
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:27,177
Don't be shy.
Tell them what you said to me last night.

281
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,936
- No.
- Say what you said to her last night.

282
00:21:32,444 --> 00:21:36,109
Kuntar petiki maya.
Al fuks su.

283
00:21:36,198 --> 00:21:38,523
You got to be kidding me.

284
00:21:38,617 --> 00:21:40,941
lt means, ''l like to mate after battle.''

285
00:21:41,035 --> 00:21:43,029
- That's not what l said!
- Yes.

286
00:21:43,122 --> 00:21:46,906
No, no. That wasn't the one l said.
This one means, ''Kill Kirk.''

287
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:50,869
And also, ''Hallelujah,''
depending on the context.

288
00:21:50,964 --> 00:21:53,289
You must have gotten it confused with...

289
00:21:53,383 --> 00:21:55,874
...plejit amor eke frek ize ka.

290
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:58,092
Ah! That is good!

291
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,718
You know what that means, Tim?
Well, l do.

292
00:22:00,808 --> 00:22:04,640
lt means, ''Get the fuck out of my house
before l chop your fucking head off.''

293
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:15,020
Mark, he's a knight.

294
00:22:15,115 --> 00:22:17,903
He's just a fast-food knight.

295
00:22:20,163 --> 00:22:22,155
l should get going.

296
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,844
Thanks for the cereal.

297
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,883
l had a lovely evening.

298
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:41,513
By the way, it says ''balls'' on your face.

299
00:22:43,814 --> 00:22:46,601
- Asshole.
- My mom did it.

300
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,356
In the spring.
the hungry gator must find new ...

301
00:22:53,991 --> 00:22:58,321
...and clever ways to find food.

302
00:23:01,374 --> 00:23:04,412
Did you tell Large about the tapes?

303
00:23:04,504 --> 00:23:07,208
No, Mom.
l'm not doing those stupid tapes.

304
00:23:07,297 --> 00:23:09,290
- What are the tapes?
- Real estate tapes.

305
00:23:09,383 --> 00:23:12,717
You could make up to
$1 00,000 your first year.

306
00:23:12,803 --> 00:23:15,722
You should have seen
the boat this Oriental guy had.

307
00:23:15,808 --> 00:23:18,477
And he even had his own game show
in China, he had so much money.

308
00:23:18,561 --> 00:23:20,636
l think Mark would be perfect at it.

309
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:24,429
Ma, shut up about those fuckin' tapes,
OK? lt's a scam.

310
00:23:24,524 --> 00:23:28,191
Well, l'm doin' it.
l'm savin' up for those tapes.

311
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:31,150
Because l know what you could be
if you just apply yourself.

312
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:34,194
l do apply myself every day, Mom.

313
00:23:34,285 --> 00:23:37,453
l work my ass off
burying dead people, OK?

314
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:40,457
l'm only 26. l'm not in any rush.
What's your rush for?

315
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:46,127
Just let me be.
l don't rush you.

316
00:23:47,383 --> 00:23:50,171
OK, then l'll do 'em myself.

317
00:23:50,261 --> 00:23:53,049
Fine, do 'em.

318
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:57,007
OK, then l won't let you on my yacht.

319
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,354
Except Large.
Large, you can come anytime you want.

320
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,479
Just don't bring your friend here.

321
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:07,020
Oh, shit.

322
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,106
Shit, l got to go to my meeting.

323
00:24:10,785 --> 00:24:12,777
OK.

324
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:17,205
l love you.

325
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:19,912
- l love you, too.
- l love you.

326
00:24:22,589 --> 00:24:26,124
- Large, it was nice to see you.
- Nice to see you, too.

327
00:24:26,218 --> 00:24:28,923
Oh, oh, you guys.
Don't stay in here all day.

328
00:24:29,013 --> 00:24:31,717
l took the batteries out of
the carbon monoxide detector.

329
00:24:31,806 --> 00:24:34,346
lt was beeping all night.

330
00:24:37,188 --> 00:24:39,347
She drives me crazy!

331
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:42,727
She gets all baked out and makes
me feel like l have to impress her.

332
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:47,482
And you know what? l'm OK with
being unimpressive. l sleep better.

333
00:24:48,909 --> 00:24:51,910
- Hey, what time is it?
- No idea.

334
00:24:51,996 --> 00:24:53,989
Oh, my-- l got to go.

335
00:24:59,295 --> 00:25:02,961
Hi. l'm Andrew Largeman. l'm sorry,
l'm really late for my appointment.

336
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:05,837
Andrew, Andrew...
OK, Andrew.

337
00:25:05,928 --> 00:25:08,930
l'm gonna need you to fill out
this paperwork for me, OK?

338
00:25:09,015 --> 00:25:11,803
- As soon as we're ready, we'll call you.
- Thank you. l'm sorry.

339
00:25:11,893 --> 00:25:14,562
lt's OK. Have a seat.
Hello, Miss Lubin.

340
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:17,682
- Oh, hello there.
- Have a seat. We'll be with you soon.

341
00:25:17,774 --> 00:25:20,064
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

342
00:25:43,886 --> 00:25:45,844
How's it goin'?

343
00:25:48,516 --> 00:25:51,683
Get off! Get off!

344
00:26:00,821 --> 00:26:02,150
Heel.

345
00:26:04,618 --> 00:26:06,611
Heel!

346
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:15,751
- Got any suggestions?
- What?

347
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,006
- You got any suggestions?
- Yeah, kick his balls.

348
00:26:20,594 --> 00:26:22,587
Kick his balls.

349
00:26:24,138 --> 00:26:28,220
Yeah, but l don't want to, like, destroy
future generations of charitable dogs.

350
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,268
Don't worry.
l got three Dobermans.

351
00:26:30,354 --> 00:26:33,771
lf l don't kick them in the balls regularly,
l'd never get anything done.

352
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,815
But he's got to be close
to finishing by now.

353
00:26:35,902 --> 00:26:39,686
Not yet. Here comes the lipstick.

354
00:26:39,781 --> 00:26:41,062
- Mrs. Lubin?
- Yes?

355
00:26:41,158 --> 00:26:44,444
- We're ready for you now.
- OK. Come on, Arthur.

356
00:26:51,628 --> 00:26:54,165
l feel so used.

357
00:26:54,255 --> 00:26:59,463
Thanks for your help,
or, at least, your good intentions.

358
00:26:59,553 --> 00:27:02,508
- l recognize you.
- Oh, did you go to Columbia High?

359
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:04,757
No, not from high school. From TV.

360
00:27:04,851 --> 00:27:06,890
Didn't you play the retarded quarterback?

361
00:27:06,977 --> 00:27:09,848
- Yeah.
- Are you really retarded?

362
00:27:11,817 --> 00:27:15,233
- No, l'm not.
- Cool.

363
00:27:15,321 --> 00:27:18,939
Great job, man. l mean,
l thought you were really retarded.

364
00:27:19,033 --> 00:27:22,235
You're just as good as that Corky kid,
and he's actually retarded.

365
00:27:22,327 --> 00:27:28,284
lf there's some sort of retarded Oscar,
you would win hands down, kick his ass.

366
00:27:28,376 --> 00:27:31,046
Well, thank you.
Thanks, l appreciate it.

367
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:33,621
l have to fill out this form, though, so...

368
00:27:33,716 --> 00:27:35,708
- Right on.
- Thanks.

369
00:27:40,181 --> 00:27:44,013
My cousin's an actor. Jake Ryan
Winters? Doubt you've ever heard of him.

370
00:27:44,102 --> 00:27:48,017
He was, like, on X ena once,
as a gnome or something.

371
00:27:48,107 --> 00:27:52,021
- That's really cool, though.
- Thanks.

372
00:27:53,362 --> 00:27:55,319
Oh, my God!

373
00:27:55,406 --> 00:27:59,784
That scene, that last scene where you
give the speech to the whole stadium.

374
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:03,570
And your dad-- Oh!
And your dad gives you the thumbs-up!

375
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:09,040
That was, like... that was emotional.

376
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,087
So, you got anything else coming out?

377
00:28:11,174 --> 00:28:13,416
No, you know.
l'm just, l'm auditioning--

378
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:16,843
l can't believe you're not really retarded!
Jake's not a very good actor.

379
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:20,679
You can't really tell on X ena, 'cause he's
in the hairy gnome suit and everything,

380
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:24,635
but when we were little, he used to
put on these really low-budg renditions

381
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:29,725
of Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals
in our attic, and they were awful!

382
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:32,903
Like, so bad. Aah!

383
00:28:33,907 --> 00:28:37,572
lt sucks, though, 'cause there's not that
much work for little people, you know.

384
00:28:37,661 --> 00:28:40,116
Anyway, l've been talking too much.

385
00:28:40,205 --> 00:28:42,958
l'll just--
You got to fill out your forms.

386
00:28:43,043 --> 00:28:46,043
What are you listening to?

387
00:28:46,128 --> 00:28:49,711
- The Shins. You know 'em?
- No.

388
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:53,168
You got to hear this one song.
lt'll change your life, l swear.

389
00:28:53,261 --> 00:28:57,011
Oh, l'm sorry. You have to--
You got to fill out your forms.

390
00:28:57,099 --> 00:29:00,633
Conundrum!
Think you could maybe listen while--

391
00:29:00,727 --> 00:29:03,349
- l think l can handle it.
- Yeah? OK.

392
00:29:16,996 --> 00:29:21,208
Gold teeth and a curse for this town

393
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,748
Were all in my mouth

394
00:29:23,837 --> 00:29:28,629
Only. I don't know how
they got out. dear

395
00:29:28,717 --> 00:29:31,089
Turn me back into the pet...

396
00:29:31,178 --> 00:29:32,672
lt's good. l like it.

397
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,890
- So, what are you here for?
- What are you here for?

398
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:40,184
Waiting for a friend. You?

399
00:29:42,232 --> 00:29:44,805
- l, uh--
- Oh, fuck, that was nosy. l'm sorry.

400
00:29:44,901 --> 00:29:46,894
Ugh. l am, l am so nosy.

401
00:29:46,987 --> 00:29:49,656
l didn't, l didn't mean to be-- l'm sorry.

402
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,944
No, just, l get these headaches.
l just want to have it checked out.

403
00:29:53,036 --> 00:29:55,194
Cool.

404
00:29:55,288 --> 00:29:57,031
- Andrew Largeman?
- Yes?

405
00:29:57,123 --> 00:30:00,326
- We're ready for you now.
- Oh, OK.

406
00:30:00,418 --> 00:30:03,503
- Thank you. Nice meeting you.
- You didn't. l'm Sam.

407
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:07,457
- Andrew.
- Nice to meet you.

408
00:30:07,552 --> 00:30:10,387
- Good luck with your head.
- Thanks.

409
00:30:12,097 --> 00:30:14,589
Don't worry, Sam.
We'll be with you next.

410
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:46,588
- Mr. Andrew Largeman?
- Yes, hi.

411
00:30:46,677 --> 00:30:48,801
- There's nothing wrong with you.
- What?

412
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,846
Just kidding.
How would l know that?

413
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,340
Uh...

414
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,973
l'm Dr. Cohen.

415
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:01,313
What can we do for you today, Andrew?

416
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:03,941
l've been getting these
really intense headaches.

417
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:07,281
Um, they last for, like, a split second.

418
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:11,662
lt's like lightening. lt's like a surge
of electricity, and then it's gone.

419
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:17,076
Lithium?

420
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,162
How long have you been on the lithium?

421
00:31:19,255 --> 00:31:23,799
Um, l've been on some form of it
since l was ten or so.

422
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:30,675
And the Paxil, Zoloft,
Celexa... Depakote?

423
00:31:30,768 --> 00:31:33,474
Did they help you at all?

424
00:31:33,563 --> 00:31:35,603
No.

425
00:31:36,983 --> 00:31:38,691
l mean, l don't know.

426
00:31:38,776 --> 00:31:41,861
lt's recently occurred to me
l might not even have a problem.

427
00:31:41,946 --> 00:31:44,949
Only, l'd never know it,
because as far back as l can remember,

428
00:31:45,034 --> 00:31:48,735
l've been medicated.
l left them in L.A., though.

429
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:53,575
This is the first time l haven't had
medicine in my body for a long time.

430
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:57,251
Well, that stuff will leave your body pretty
fast. l could write you a prescription.

431
00:31:57,339 --> 00:31:59,747
Actually, l was thinking
about taking a vacation.

432
00:31:59,842 --> 00:32:02,131
Have you discussed this
with your psychiatrist?

433
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:06,596
Uh... well, my psychiatrist is my dad.

434
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:10,929
Yeah, so l think
he'd prefer me to stay on it.

435
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,354
He... likes to think it makes me happy.

436
00:32:15,984 --> 00:32:19,519
You know, our bodies are capable
of doing some very funny things

437
00:32:19,613 --> 00:32:22,733
when they're consumed
with stress and anxiety.

438
00:32:22,825 --> 00:32:24,782
Uh...

439
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:29,746
l found my ex-best friend's
cufflinks in my wife's purse.

440
00:32:30,626 --> 00:32:32,534
Hmm.

441
00:32:32,627 --> 00:32:37,040
l couldn't get an erection
for year and a half... for example.

442
00:32:39,218 --> 00:32:42,006
Wow. Um...

443
00:32:42,097 --> 00:32:45,098
But, l don't really think that's it,
because l don't,

444
00:32:45,183 --> 00:32:48,516
l don't really feel, like,
stressed or anxious at all.

445
00:32:48,603 --> 00:32:52,436
Well, with all the lithium he's had you on,
it's amazing you can even hear me now.

446
00:32:54,527 --> 00:32:56,733
Look, Andrew, first of all,

447
00:32:56,821 --> 00:33:00,273
l think you do need to find a psychiatrist
that isn't your father.

448
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:05,159
That's something that should have been
remedied years ago. He knows better!

449
00:33:05,247 --> 00:33:08,865
And secondly... l'm in no position
to comment on whether

450
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:12,079
you should stay on the meds or not,
'cause l don't know your story.

451
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:16,169
But my opinion , since you're paying for it,

452
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:19,877
is that yeah, those drugs may help you
as a means to an end.

453
00:33:19,971 --> 00:33:22,178
But sooner or later,
if you're not in therapy,

454
00:33:22,265 --> 00:33:27,012
whatever's going on in your mind will find
a way to peek its head out of the water.

455
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,262
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

456
00:33:29,356 --> 00:33:32,441
Yeah, you're all right.
You're alive.

457
00:33:32,526 --> 00:33:35,196
Come on.
l'll take a look at you. Come.

458
00:33:36,823 --> 00:33:40,275
l'll need you to take your shoes off.
l have to scratch your feet.

459
00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:43,737
Godspeed all the bakers at dawn

460
00:33:44,748 --> 00:33:47,321
May they all cut their thumbs

461
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:51,084
And bleed into their buns
till they melt away

462
00:33:53,258 --> 00:33:57,386
I'm looking in on the good life

463
00:33:57,471 --> 00:34:00,840
I might be doomed never to find

464
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:05,642
And if you'd 'a took to me. like

465
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:08,684
I'd 'a danced like
the queen of the eyesores

466
00:34:08,775 --> 00:34:11,348
And the rest of our lives
would 'a fared well

467
00:34:13,363 --> 00:34:15,486
So, why were you really there?

468
00:34:15,574 --> 00:34:19,073
Charging. l'm a robot.

469
00:34:19,161 --> 00:34:22,613
- Do you lie a lot?
- What do you consider a lot?

470
00:34:22,707 --> 00:34:24,700
Enough for people to call you a liar.

471
00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:28,541
- People call me lots of things.
- ls one of them ''liar''?

472
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,500
l could say no,
but how would you know l'm not lying?

473
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:34,129
l guess l could choose to trust you.

474
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:36,711
- You can do that?
- l can try.

475
00:34:37,891 --> 00:34:40,926
Whose bike is that?

476
00:34:41,018 --> 00:34:43,592
lt was my grandfather's.

477
00:34:43,688 --> 00:34:47,639
lt was the only thing he left to anyone
in my family, and he left it to me.

478
00:34:47,735 --> 00:34:49,727
And l like it.

479
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:57,025
So, this is the point in the conversation
where you ask me if l'd like a ride home.

480
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,362
- lt is?
- Yep.

481
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,915
Would you like a ride home?

482
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:09,623
Fine... but l'm not getting in that sidecar.

483
00:35:09,717 --> 00:35:12,338
- Why not?
- Sidecars are for bitches.

484
00:35:12,428 --> 00:35:15,263
Anyone who rides in that
is automatically your bitch.

485
00:35:15,348 --> 00:35:17,388
Thus, l better ride on the back.

486
00:35:26,193 --> 00:35:28,186
- Oh.
- Hold on tight.

487
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:30,271
OK, holdin'!

488
00:35:33,702 --> 00:35:36,193
My hair's blowin' in the wind.

489
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:42,792
What, are you, like, a hand glider?

490
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:46,711
My boyfriend was gonna pick me up,
so l brought it, but then he couldn't.

491
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,042
What does he have,
one of those tandem things?

492
00:35:49,135 --> 00:35:52,052
No, he drives a Ninja.
Goes way faster than this guy.

493
00:35:52,138 --> 00:35:55,389
- What kind of helmet is that?
- You can wear it on a bike.

494
00:35:55,476 --> 00:35:57,801
- How's your head?
- l should live through the day.

495
00:35:57,895 --> 00:36:00,018
- Cool. Make a right here.
- All right.

496
00:36:05,695 --> 00:36:09,444
- Are you doing anything right now?
- Can you elaborate on ''doing anything''?

497
00:36:09,532 --> 00:36:12,902
lt's just, l know this guy, Jesse.
He bought this mansion right up here.

498
00:36:12,995 --> 00:36:16,530
And he wants me to come visit him,
but l don't want to stay very long.

499
00:36:16,623 --> 00:36:19,246
So, l was thinking, like, if you came, too,

500
00:36:19,336 --> 00:36:21,956
l could just say l have to take you home
when l'm ready to go.

501
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:26,044
Wow. That's pretty damn
random of you, Andrew.

502
00:36:26,134 --> 00:36:28,626
- Well...
- ''Nice to meet you. Can l use you?''

503
00:36:28,721 --> 00:36:31,675
- lt's the Hollywood in you.
- No. Come on, it's not like that.

504
00:36:31,766 --> 00:36:36,344
lt'll be fun, come on. l'll tell you what.
We can have, like, a signal.

505
00:36:36,437 --> 00:36:39,522
Like, when you pull on your ear,
that's the code.

506
00:36:39,608 --> 00:36:41,684
And l'll be like,
''Oh, l got to take her home.''

507
00:36:41,777 --> 00:36:45,063
And then, then we'll go.

508
00:36:45,155 --> 00:36:47,232
Can we have code names, too?

509
00:36:47,324 --> 00:36:49,993
lf you want.

510
00:36:50,076 --> 00:36:53,162
OK... but don't try and, like,
kidnap me or anything,

511
00:36:53,247 --> 00:36:57,198
'cause my step uncle's a bounty hunter,
and he could have you tracked and killed.

512
00:36:57,293 --> 00:36:59,333
You're such a liar.

513
00:37:01,882 --> 00:37:03,875
Whoo!

514
00:37:05,177 --> 00:37:07,549
OK, you ready?

515
00:37:28,453 --> 00:37:31,537
l'll be fine. Am l the first boy
you've ever brought home?

516
00:37:31,622 --> 00:37:36,665
No, but, um... l lied to you before when l
told you that my boyfriend drives a Ninja.

517
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:40,918
- He doesn't drive a bike?
- No, l don't have a boyfriend.

518
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:45,052
But, you know, he might drive a Ninja...
wherever he is.

519
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,094
Wow, we're off to a great start.

520
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:51,476
OK. So-So sometimes l lie.

521
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:54,100
l mean, l'm weird, man.

522
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:57,523
About random stuff, too.
l don't even know why l do it.

523
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:01,608
lt's like, it's like a tic. l mean, sometimes
l hear myself say something,

524
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:06,407
and then l think,
''Wow, that wasn't even remotely true.''

525
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:09,068
So, how do people know what's real?

526
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:14,751
Well, l always feel bad afterwards
and admit them when they're lies.

527
00:38:14,837 --> 00:38:19,546
- Can you trust that?
- Open the door.

528
00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:29,926
Kevin, down. Mom!

529
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:34,268
Come on, kick 'em in the balls.
Come on. Mom!

530
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:38,189
Everybody down.
Who wants to eat?

531
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,522
Do you want to eat?
Then get the fuck off him.

532
00:38:40,616 --> 00:38:42,572
Go on, get out.

533
00:38:44,828 --> 00:38:47,616
l'm so sorry.
We just don't have the time to train them.

534
00:38:47,707 --> 00:38:49,996
- Who's got the time to train them?
- Mom.

535
00:38:50,084 --> 00:38:53,204
- This is Andrew.
- Welcome, welcome.

536
00:38:53,296 --> 00:38:55,787
- l'm sorry the place is a wreck. Honey?
- Mm-hmm?

537
00:38:55,882 --> 00:38:58,504
l asked you to get the metal wheel
out of the hamster cage?

538
00:38:58,593 --> 00:39:01,263
- l forgot.
- Well, you forgot, and now Jelly's dead.

539
00:39:01,346 --> 00:39:03,635
Luckily, l got Peanut Butter out in time.

540
00:39:03,724 --> 00:39:05,717
We have to get the only hamsters
on planet Earth

541
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:08,302
who can't figure out
a stupid hamster wheel.

542
00:39:08,397 --> 00:39:10,519
There's a tin box on the kitchen counter.

543
00:39:10,606 --> 00:39:13,098
You can do the honors.
l have to get to work.

544
00:39:13,192 --> 00:39:16,858
- lt's nice to meet you. Andrew, right?
- Yes. Very nice to meet you.

545
00:39:16,947 --> 00:39:19,984
Samantha, put the clothes
in the dryer and bury Jelly.

546
00:39:25,456 --> 00:39:27,495
So, this is it.

547
00:39:35,009 --> 00:39:37,582
- lt's nice.
- No, it's not.

548
00:39:37,678 --> 00:39:40,050
Don't say that 'cause
you can't think of anything else.

549
00:39:40,138 --> 00:39:45,015
l'm not, l'm not. lt's very cozy. You guys
are a little early on the tree, though.

550
00:39:45,103 --> 00:39:47,641
Yeah, well, we never got around
to taking it down,

551
00:39:47,731 --> 00:39:50,815
so when it got to be fall again,
we figured, just leave it up.

552
00:39:50,901 --> 00:39:54,317
Oh, my God.
You're totally freaked out right now.

553
00:39:54,405 --> 00:39:59,067
- You, like, can't wait to leave.
- l'm not, l'm not. l like it. lt's very nice.

554
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,995
- You want to see my room?
- Sure.

555
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:08,574
Hey. Titembay, this is my friend Andrew.
Andrew, this is my brother, Titembay.

556
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:12,170
- Hi, it's very nice to meet you.
- Oh, it's nice to meet you.

557
00:40:12,257 --> 00:40:14,250
- l'm sorry about Jelly.
- Oh, that's OK.

558
00:40:14,343 --> 00:40:16,800
l saved some mac and cheese for you.
lt's in the fridge.

559
00:40:16,888 --> 00:40:19,344
Thank you.

560
00:40:23,102 --> 00:40:25,676
Anyway... l'm late for class.

561
00:40:25,772 --> 00:40:28,145
- lt's nice meeting you.
- Very nice to meet you.

562
00:40:28,234 --> 00:40:31,069
See you later.

563
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:37,405
So, here we are.
lt's nothing fancy, but you know...

564
00:40:37,493 --> 00:40:39,866
What?

565
00:40:39,955 --> 00:40:42,529
Uh, it's Titembay, right?

566
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:45,745
Yeah, it's weird, huh?
You're, like, so freaked out right now.

567
00:40:45,836 --> 00:40:48,791
You're running for the door. lt's OK.
You can go. Don't feel bad--

568
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:50,376
- Stop doing that.
- What?

569
00:40:50,466 --> 00:40:54,132
The thing you just did. Don't do that.
l want to be here. lf l didn't, l wouldn't be.

570
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,138
Trust me, my family is way more
fucked up than yours, OK?

571
00:40:57,224 --> 00:40:58,884
OK.

572
00:40:58,976 --> 00:41:01,847
So... Titembay.

573
00:41:01,938 --> 00:41:04,179
Yeah, he's my brother.

574
00:41:04,273 --> 00:41:06,978
- ls he adopted, or...?
- Kind of.

575
00:41:07,068 --> 00:41:09,475
My mom adopted him
from Sally Struthers years ago.

576
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,442
One of those ''For the cost
of a cup of coffee a day'' things.

577
00:41:12,533 --> 00:41:15,570
Where she's like, ''How can you
sit there and not help the children?''

578
00:41:15,661 --> 00:41:18,661
And we just couldn't sit there
and not help the children.

579
00:41:18,747 --> 00:41:23,077
So, we start sending him, like,
pictures and letters and stuff for years,

580
00:41:23,168 --> 00:41:26,788
but then l got really into ice skating,
so we sort of forgot about him.

581
00:41:26,882 --> 00:41:30,251
Then one day... we get this phone call,
and it's Titembay.

582
00:41:30,344 --> 00:41:33,095
He's at the dry cleaners
around the corner. And he's like,

583
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:36,763
''l'm at Rutgers. l live in the dorms,
but l'm used to living with my tribe,

584
00:41:36,851 --> 00:41:41,347
so l'd rather live with a family.''
And he's been living with us ever since.

585
00:41:41,439 --> 00:41:43,895
Wow.

586
00:41:43,984 --> 00:41:47,898
l know. He's the most amazing guy.
You ought to hear some of his stories.

587
00:41:47,988 --> 00:41:50,942
He struggled through so much
because he wanted to learn.

588
00:41:51,033 --> 00:41:55,197
When l think of what he's accomplished,
l just, l just feel, like, lazy, you know?

589
00:41:55,287 --> 00:41:57,614
He's studying criminal justice at Rutgers,

590
00:41:57,708 --> 00:42:01,491
and when he was a baby, he was one of
those kids with the flies all over his face.

591
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:07,084
Wow.
l mean, it's a crazy story.

592
00:42:07,175 --> 00:42:10,759
Yeah, l know. l mean,
that's a true story. l am not that good.

593
00:42:10,847 --> 00:42:14,511
Ohh... this is Tickle.

594
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,557
What is Tickle?

595
00:42:16,644 --> 00:42:19,135
Tickle's my favorite thing
in the whole world.

596
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:22,232
lt's all that's left of Nanny, my blanket.

597
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:24,441
- Tickle's all that remains.
- Mm-hmm.

598
00:42:24,528 --> 00:42:26,984
- Was there, like, a hurricane?
- Shut up!

599
00:42:27,073 --> 00:42:30,406
No, l mean...
l've had this since l was a baby.

600
00:42:30,492 --> 00:42:34,574
lt's what they brought me
home in from the hospital.

601
00:42:34,664 --> 00:42:37,500
- lt's like the Wailing Wall.
- What?

602
00:42:37,584 --> 00:42:40,372
Oh, the Wailing Wall is, like, this...

603
00:42:40,462 --> 00:42:43,582
lt's, like, the most holy place for Jews
to go and pray in lsrael.

604
00:42:43,674 --> 00:42:48,586
lt's all that's left of this enormous temple
that was destroyed by the Romans.

605
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,716
- So you're, like, really Jewish.
- What?

606
00:42:51,808 --> 00:42:54,479
You are, aren't you? You are.

607
00:42:54,562 --> 00:42:57,099
l'm not. l mean, l'm Jewish,
but l'm not really Jewish.

608
00:42:57,189 --> 00:42:59,182
l mean, l don't do anything Jewish.

609
00:42:59,274 --> 00:43:02,644
l don't go to temple or anything, but l
don't know any Jews that go to temple.

610
00:43:02,736 --> 00:43:06,605
The Jews l know, they go on one day.
lt's Yom Kippur, the Day of Repentance.

611
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,194
OK.

612
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:11,369
Did you know that most temples
are built with moveable walls,

613
00:43:11,454 --> 00:43:14,124
so that on the one day of the year
when everyone comes to repent,

614
00:43:14,207 --> 00:43:17,079
they can actually make
the room big enough to hold everyone?

615
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:20,087
l don't really believe in God.

616
00:43:20,173 --> 00:43:22,795
- Just Tickle.
- Oh, l believe in Tickle.

617
00:43:25,137 --> 00:43:28,304
- We're not gonna make out or anything.
- What?

618
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:31,178
l'm sorry. l just totally
ruined that moment, didn't l?

619
00:43:31,268 --> 00:43:34,720
- lt's just, we're not gonna make out, OK?
- No, l hadn't planned on trying--

620
00:43:34,814 --> 00:43:37,519
Oh, l am so lame.
That was, like, really--

621
00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:41,523
l'm... l'm sorry. Forget l just said that.
l'm-- That was dumb.

622
00:43:41,613 --> 00:43:44,649
You know what l do when l feel
completely unoriginal?

623
00:43:44,741 --> 00:43:45,773
What?

624
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:50,659
Blah, blah, blah, blah, la!

625
00:43:50,748 --> 00:43:54,034
l-l make a noise, or l do something
that no one has ever done before,

626
00:43:54,126 --> 00:43:57,959
and then l can feel unique again,
even if it's only for, like, a second.

627
00:43:58,047 --> 00:44:01,630
- So, no one's ever done that?
- No. Not in this spot, no.

628
00:44:01,718 --> 00:44:05,254
You just witnessed a completely
original moment in human history.

629
00:44:05,348 --> 00:44:07,471
- lt's refreshing. You should try it.
- No, thanks.

630
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:09,681
- Come on.
- No, l think that was good enough

631
00:44:09,768 --> 00:44:12,604
- for the both of us.
- Come on! What are you, shy?

632
00:44:12,688 --> 00:44:16,983
This is your one opportunity to do
something no one has ever done before,

633
00:44:17,069 --> 00:44:19,525
that no one will copy again
throughout human existence.

634
00:44:19,613 --> 00:44:21,855
And if nothing else,
you'll be remembered

635
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:26,113
as the one guy who ever did this -
this one thing.

636
00:44:28,164 --> 00:44:30,702
Uh...

637
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:39,715
- How was that?
- Oh, l've done that one before.

638
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:45,223
So, l got to go bury this hamster
before the dogs eat him.

639
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:48,014
Wanna help? Hmm?

640
00:44:52,566 --> 00:44:55,318
Stood beneath an orange sky

641
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:02,615
- Wow.
- Yeah.

642
00:45:02,703 --> 00:45:04,944
- l mean, this is, uh--
- l know.

643
00:45:05,997 --> 00:45:08,073
lt's not that we're bad pet owners.

644
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:12,035
lt's just, you know, we've had
so many of them over the years.

645
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:14,455
Besides, a lot of these are fish.

646
00:45:14,549 --> 00:45:17,040
After you.

647
00:45:24,726 --> 00:45:27,514
All right.

648
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,933
Sit down.

649
00:45:39,326 --> 00:45:41,318
What are you thinking about?

650
00:45:42,621 --> 00:45:45,113
- Now?
- Yeah.

651
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:48,576
- Right now?
- Yeah.

652
00:45:48,669 --> 00:45:52,038
Right now, l was thinking l've been going
to a lot of these things lately.

653
00:45:52,131 --> 00:45:54,705
- What, dates?
- Not dates.

654
00:45:54,801 --> 00:45:57,803
This is a date?
This isn't a date.

655
00:45:57,888 --> 00:45:59,964
Funerals.

656
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:02,049
Why? Who else died?

657
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:05,720
Oh, um...

658
00:46:06,688 --> 00:46:10,106
That's why l'm home, actually.
l guess l haven't even told you that yet.

659
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:16,444
My mom just died.

660
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:24,118
God, that's weird
to say that out loud, but, uh...

661
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:31,335
My mom just died, and...
yeah, that's why l'm home.

662
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:35,842
l'm so sorry.
God, l'm so sorry.

663
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:38,681
And here l am, putting you
through another one of these.

664
00:46:38,766 --> 00:46:42,681
Not that Jelly's anywhere near your mom.
l mean, we loved Jelly, but...

665
00:46:44,564 --> 00:46:48,348
- l'm so sorry.
- No, it's OK. lt's all right.

666
00:46:48,443 --> 00:46:50,436
l'm all right with it.

667
00:46:50,529 --> 00:46:53,365
Anyway, l think it's
what she wanted, so...

668
00:46:53,449 --> 00:46:55,857
How did she die?

669
00:46:57,495 --> 00:46:59,487
She drowned, actually.

670
00:47:02,124 --> 00:47:04,118
Yeah, my mother was a paraplegic.

671
00:47:04,211 --> 00:47:07,995
She was in a wheelchair,
so she... you know.

672
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:13,843
And... l guess she was taking a bath,
and she must have slipped or something.

673
00:47:13,929 --> 00:47:15,887
That's what they say.
l don't know.

674
00:47:15,974 --> 00:47:18,382
But, needless to say, she drowned,

675
00:47:18,476 --> 00:47:22,309
and that's how she... she died.

676
00:47:22,397 --> 00:47:24,805
When?

677
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,142
This was, uh...

678
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,278
...Sunday.

679
00:47:30,364 --> 00:47:33,365
Oh, my God.

680
00:47:38,249 --> 00:47:40,206
Why are you crying?

681
00:47:42,127 --> 00:47:44,120
l don't know. l'm sorry.

682
00:47:45,506 --> 00:47:48,839
l'm not usually like this.
lt's just, like...

683
00:47:50,387 --> 00:47:52,380
lt's just so sad.

684
00:47:52,473 --> 00:47:54,715
You know, it's like...

685
00:47:54,808 --> 00:47:56,765
lt's so tragic, isn't it? lt is.

686
00:47:56,851 --> 00:48:01,894
l mean, it's like, it's like real-life tragedy
or something. l mean...

687
00:48:01,983 --> 00:48:04,937
Anyway, let's just,
let's change the subject, OK?

688
00:48:05,028 --> 00:48:07,067
Let's really bring
the focus back to Jelly,

689
00:48:07,155 --> 00:48:10,274
'cause what could be ruder than talking
about someone else who died

690
00:48:10,366 --> 00:48:13,119
when you're in the act
of burying a close friend?

691
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:16,322
- Well, what should we do?
- l don't know.

692
00:48:16,415 --> 00:48:19,665
l've only been to one of these things.
You appear to be the expert.

693
00:48:19,752 --> 00:48:22,587
Well, we usually say something.

694
00:48:22,672 --> 00:48:25,673
OK, l'll go first. Um...

695
00:48:27,552 --> 00:48:30,719
Didn't really know you, Jelly.
From what l hear, you were a good pet.

696
00:48:30,806 --> 00:48:33,131
- Little trouble with the wheel--
- That's not funny.

697
00:48:39,023 --> 00:48:41,431
Jelly, you were a great pet.

698
00:48:43,569 --> 00:48:46,061
l'm sorry l forgot to take
the wheel out of your cage.

699
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:48,564
l'm so, so sorry about that.

700
00:48:50,161 --> 00:48:52,829
Goodbye.

701
00:48:52,913 --> 00:48:55,119
l hope that you liked me.

702
00:49:13,353 --> 00:49:15,511
If I lived

703
00:49:15,605 --> 00:49:22,273
Till I was 1 02

704
00:49:23,072 --> 00:49:28,493
I just don't think I'll ever

705
00:49:28,577 --> 00:49:32,707
Get over you

706
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,915
Holy shit! You scared the shit out of me.
Why are you always doing that?

707
00:49:42,009 --> 00:49:46,222
- l haven't seen you in a while.
- l've been catching up with people here--

708
00:49:46,306 --> 00:49:49,757
Dr. Cohen called.
There's nothing wrong with you.

709
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:53,136
Yeah, l think l'm starting
to figure that out myself.

710
00:49:53,229 --> 00:49:56,979
- When are you thinking of leaving?
- Uh, probably tomorrow.

711
00:49:57,068 --> 00:50:01,279
Um... you know, l got a lot of stuff
l got to take care of in L.A.

712
00:50:02,156 --> 00:50:04,825
- Probably have to find a new job, so--
- We need to talk.

713
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:08,906
Yeah. How?
l mean, when?

714
00:50:09,998 --> 00:50:12,620
What are you doing now?

715
00:50:14,086 --> 00:50:17,705
Now's not good, 'cause l told my friend
Mark l was gonna meet up with him.

716
00:50:17,798 --> 00:50:20,254
But how about, like, later tonight?

717
00:50:20,343 --> 00:50:23,510
- OK, then, we'll talk.
- Yeah.

718
00:50:23,596 --> 00:50:26,681
We owe that to each other.

719
00:50:26,766 --> 00:50:28,760
Yeah.

720
00:50:28,853 --> 00:50:30,846
We owe it to her.

721
00:50:32,439 --> 00:50:34,812
Yeah.

722
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,893
Good.

723
00:50:36,986 --> 00:50:38,979
Sorry l scared you.

724
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:43,984
How could you leave all that lithium?

725
00:50:44,078 --> 00:50:46,615
l was totally gonna
hit you up for some, man.

726
00:50:46,705 --> 00:50:50,038
This fucking guy.
l'm glad you're back, man.

727
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:54,076
'Cause this town is so messed up.
Everyone's got their drug of choice.

728
00:50:54,172 --> 00:50:56,924
lt's like in Brave New World.
You ever read that book?

729
00:50:57,008 --> 00:51:00,128
Who wrote that? Aldous...

730
00:51:00,219 --> 00:51:03,305
Aldous something. Aldous...

731
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:05,467
Anyway, there's, like,

732
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:09,344
Alphas and Betas and Epsilons
and all sorts of people...

733
00:51:23,078 --> 00:51:25,487
Huxtable.

734
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:29,709
Aldous Huxtable.
That's it, bro.

735
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,804
Andrew, would you like to see
Sam's ice-skating tape?

736
00:51:48,899 --> 00:51:50,726
- Mom, no.
- Absolutely.

737
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:54,234
She was so ahead of her time.
She could have gone to the Olympics.

738
00:51:54,321 --> 00:51:56,314
No, no, no, no.
l couldn't have.

739
00:51:56,406 --> 00:51:59,657
Yes, you could've. Don't blame it
on the epilepsy. You had a gift.

740
00:51:59,744 --> 00:52:02,745
Come on, let me see it.

741
00:52:02,831 --> 00:52:06,330
Let's show him the ''Florida Stars
of the lce'' opening. The gator costume.

742
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:09,668
- Mom, l'm asking you seriously.
- Oh, come on. Don't be shy.

743
00:52:09,755 --> 00:52:12,127
- Let me see it.
- Oh, she wants you to see it.

744
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:14,837
How could you not want him
to see how talented you are?

745
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:18,343
- Were.
- Come on.

746
00:52:18,973 --> 00:52:20,930
- Come on.
- Ugh.

747
00:52:22,686 --> 00:52:25,603
- Honey, what are you doing?
- l'm dusting for prints.

748
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:28,186
Could we move
the crime scene into the kitchen?

749
00:52:28,275 --> 00:52:29,935
l want to show Andrew Sam's skating.

750
00:52:30,027 --> 00:52:33,479
Someone's pissing on my GameCube,
and l'm about to close the case.

751
00:52:33,573 --> 00:52:38,401
- lt wasn't me, Your Honor.
- Paw prints point to a canine. Hmm.

752
00:52:38,495 --> 00:52:40,452
Andrew, sit down here on the couch.

753
00:52:40,538 --> 00:52:43,290
l can't believe you're showing him this.

754
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,994
Look, there she is.

755
00:53:01,854 --> 00:53:06,315
- You're the alligator?
- You can tell by the hands.

756
00:53:29,717 --> 00:53:31,462
Here comes the double axel.

757
00:53:31,554 --> 00:53:34,175
And... land.

758
00:53:34,265 --> 00:53:37,799
- Oh, l mean, come on. ls she good?
- Wow! She's great.

759
00:53:41,271 --> 00:53:42,683
All right.

760
00:53:42,774 --> 00:53:45,230
- Wow.
- Shut up.

761
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:47,810
No, l mean, your mom's right.
You're really good.

762
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:51,565
This was awesome, but we got to go.

763
00:53:51,658 --> 00:53:53,652
l just wanted to show him how talented--

764
00:53:53,744 --> 00:53:55,702
- Mom, come on!
- My baby!

765
00:53:55,788 --> 00:53:58,077
All right, go on.
Go on, get away.

766
00:53:58,166 --> 00:54:01,665
Wait a minute.
Give me a hug.

767
00:54:01,753 --> 00:54:04,078
l love you so much.
l'm so proud of you.

768
00:54:04,172 --> 00:54:06,165
- l love you, too.
- Have a good night.

769
00:54:06,258 --> 00:54:08,666
- Thanks for dinner.
- Come, you're giving me a hug, too.

770
00:54:08,761 --> 00:54:11,596
- Mom, come on.
- l'll take a hug.

771
00:54:20,356 --> 00:54:23,227
- Good night. See you later, Tim.
- Bye, Tim.

772
00:54:23,318 --> 00:54:26,485
Peace out, player.

773
00:54:27,365 --> 00:54:28,610
It was the only thing
I ever liked doing.

774
00:54:28,783 --> 00:54:32,199
pretending to be someone else.

775
00:54:32,287 --> 00:54:36,783
l've been so out of it, the only parts l get
offered are playing handicapped people.

776
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:40,661
- That is not funny.
- Come on, you got to see that's a joke.

777
00:54:40,755 --> 00:54:44,705
lf you can't laugh at yourself, life's gonna
seem a whole lot longer than you'd like.

778
00:54:44,801 --> 00:54:47,006
All right, so, what are we
laughing at you about?

779
00:54:47,094 --> 00:54:49,170
Mmm...

780
00:54:49,263 --> 00:54:52,016
l lied again.
l have epilepsy.

781
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,805
Which part are we laughing about?

782
00:54:54,895 --> 00:54:58,311
l, um...

783
00:54:58,399 --> 00:55:00,854
l had a seizure
at the law office where l work.

784
00:55:00,943 --> 00:55:04,359
Their insurance wouldn't cover me
unless l wore preventative covering.

785
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:08,908
- What's preventative covering?
- The helmet l was wearing.

786
00:55:08,993 --> 00:55:11,911
Oh, come on!
That's funny.

787
00:55:11,997 --> 00:55:15,496
That's really funny. l'm the only person
who wears a helmet to work

788
00:55:15,584 --> 00:55:20,246
who isn't, like, putting out fires
or, like, racing for NASCAR.

789
00:55:20,339 --> 00:55:22,747
But what do you do?
l mean, l can't quit.

790
00:55:22,842 --> 00:55:25,416
Their insurance is amazing.
What do you do?

791
00:55:25,512 --> 00:55:28,182
You laugh, you know?
l'm not saying l don't cry.

792
00:55:28,265 --> 00:55:30,934
But in between... l laugh.

793
00:55:31,017 --> 00:55:35,727
And l realize how silly it is
to take anything too seriously.

794
00:55:35,815 --> 00:55:38,982
Plus, l look forward to a good cry.

795
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:41,227
Feels pretty good.

796
00:55:42,948 --> 00:55:46,114
l haven't cried since l was a little kid.

797
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,278
l didn't cry at my mother's funeral.

798
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:50,612
l tried, you know?

799
00:55:50,706 --> 00:55:54,953
l thought of all the saddest things
l could think of, like things in movies...

800
00:55:55,044 --> 00:55:59,208
There's this image from Life magazine
that's always haunted me,

801
00:55:59,299 --> 00:56:04,542
and l just, l focused in on it, you know?
But nothing came.

802
00:56:04,638 --> 00:56:06,678
That actually made me
sadder than anything,

803
00:56:06,765 --> 00:56:10,895
- the fact that l just felt so numb.
- What do you mean?

804
00:56:10,979 --> 00:56:13,469
- Just that--
- Hey, vagina!

805
00:56:15,066 --> 00:56:17,023
Hey, what's up, guys?

806
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:21,275
Uh, Sam, that's Mark, Dave,
and you remember Jesse.

807
00:56:21,365 --> 00:56:23,654
- What's up?
- Hey, nice to meet you.

808
00:56:23,743 --> 00:56:26,826
l'm sorry l said ''vagina'' just now.
l didn't know you were here.

809
00:56:26,912 --> 00:56:29,664
- Oh, that's OK.
- Nice.

810
00:56:29,748 --> 00:56:34,079
Let's get fucked up.

811
00:56:34,171 --> 00:56:38,251
One, two, three! Whoo!

812
00:56:43,431 --> 00:56:45,388
What are you doing?

813
00:56:45,475 --> 00:56:47,681
Largeman, get the fuck in the pool.

814
00:56:47,769 --> 00:56:50,177
lt's so warm!

815
00:56:50,272 --> 00:56:52,679
Can you swim?

816
00:56:52,774 --> 00:56:54,933
Of course l can swim.

817
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:17,043
Dude, maybe you should stay
on the steps. l don't know CPR.

818
00:57:17,134 --> 00:57:19,175
You look like a wet beaver.

819
00:57:34,821 --> 00:57:38,403
There's a handful of normal kid things
I kind of missed.

820
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:43,450
There's a handful of normal
kid things I kind of wish I'd missed.

821
00:57:43,539 --> 00:57:46,208
You know that point
in your life when you realize

822
00:57:46,292 --> 00:57:49,957
the house you grew up in
isn't really your home anymore?

823
00:57:50,046 --> 00:57:53,249
All of a sudden, even though you have
someplace where you put your shit,

824
00:57:53,341 --> 00:57:55,832
that idea of home is gone.

825
00:57:58,263 --> 00:58:01,466
l still feel at home in my house.

826
00:58:01,558 --> 00:58:06,102
You'll see. When you move out, it just
sort of happens. One day, it's gone.

827
00:58:06,188 --> 00:58:09,889
And you feel like
you can never get it back.

828
00:58:09,984 --> 00:58:13,353
lt's like you feel homesick
for a place that doesn't even exist.

829
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,281
Or maybe it's like this
rite of passage, you know?

830
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:20,859
You'll never have
that feeling again until you create

831
00:58:20,954 --> 00:58:22,994
a new idea of ''home''
for yourself, you know?

832
00:58:23,081 --> 00:58:25,834
For your kids, for the family you start.

833
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,995
lt's like a cycle or something.

834
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:32,551
l don't know, but l miss
the idea of it, you know?

835
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,677
Maybe that's all a family really is...

836
00:58:40,226 --> 00:58:43,061
...a group of people who miss
the same imaginary place.

837
00:58:53,907 --> 00:58:55,900
Maybe.

838
00:58:57,369 --> 00:59:00,740
Are you ready? Whoo!

839
00:59:08,256 --> 00:59:10,712
How about some fuckin' furniture, dude?

840
00:59:10,802 --> 00:59:13,174
l bought a chair,
but l didn't like it.

841
00:59:13,263 --> 00:59:15,670
- Where is it?
- lt's keeping us warm.

842
00:59:26,444 --> 00:59:29,017
Silent Velcro.

843
00:59:29,113 --> 00:59:31,069
You lucky motherfucker.

844
00:59:31,156 --> 00:59:35,618
l feel like if l'd shown up at school
and presented the idea of silent Velcro,

845
00:59:35,704 --> 00:59:38,029
they would've sent me away
a whole lot sooner.

846
00:59:38,123 --> 00:59:41,872
- Why did they send you away?
- Ooh, listen to this girl.

847
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:45,164
- They didn't send me away.
- You just said they sent you away.

848
00:59:45,256 --> 00:59:47,544
They sent me away.
They sent me to boarding school.

849
00:59:47,633 --> 00:59:51,501
''Sent me away'' sounds like l went
to some asylum. There were no straps.

850
00:59:51,596 --> 00:59:54,680
Why did they send you
to boarding school?

851
00:59:54,766 --> 00:59:56,807
They sent me to boarding school

852
00:59:56,894 --> 01:00:01,022
because they thought
l might be dangerous.

853
01:00:01,106 --> 01:00:05,104
''You're so freaked out. You're running for
the door. You can go. Don't feel bad.''

854
01:00:05,194 --> 01:00:08,646
That's really funny.
That's really funny.

855
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:10,733
Why would they think
you'd be dangerous?

856
01:00:10,826 --> 01:00:14,408
- You're like a little detective.
- Well...

857
01:00:14,496 --> 01:00:16,572
- Yeah?
- You're gay.

858
01:00:18,166 --> 01:00:20,207
No.

859
01:00:20,294 --> 01:00:22,287
Drum roll.

860
01:00:27,177 --> 01:00:29,584
l was the reason
she was in a wheelchair.

861
01:00:30,722 --> 01:00:32,715
l pushed her.

862
01:00:34,101 --> 01:00:36,260
So, there that is.

863
01:00:38,481 --> 01:00:40,687
- Shut up.
- Fuck off.

864
01:00:40,775 --> 01:00:42,934
No, it's the truth.

865
01:00:43,027 --> 01:00:44,438
Why?

866
01:00:44,529 --> 01:00:46,985
Just a complete
freak accident, you know?

867
01:00:47,073 --> 01:00:49,446
One of those things
you replay a million times,

868
01:00:49,534 --> 01:00:53,035
and you see how clearly
it was just a complete freak thing.

869
01:00:53,123 --> 01:00:56,870
l mean, my whole life,
she was depressed for no reason.

870
01:00:56,959 --> 01:01:01,206
And one day, you know -
l was a little kid. l was nine years old -

871
01:01:01,297 --> 01:01:04,168
and l just hated her for that,

872
01:01:04,259 --> 01:01:06,632
and l pushed her.

873
01:01:06,721 --> 01:01:09,971
And it was innocent. l was just
completely frustrated, because--

874
01:01:10,057 --> 01:01:13,342
- Because you couldn't make her happy?
- Yeah. Fuck, yeah.

875
01:01:13,435 --> 01:01:16,437
And-And any other time,
you know, any other day,

876
01:01:16,523 --> 01:01:18,812
she would've yelled at me
and sent me to my room.

877
01:01:18,901 --> 01:01:23,978
But this day,
on this particular day,

878
01:01:24,073 --> 01:01:29,198
the door of the dishwasher...
had fallen open.

879
01:01:29,287 --> 01:01:33,154
The latch on it was broken,
and it would just randomly fall open.

880
01:01:33,249 --> 01:01:35,823
That fucking latch, you know...

881
01:01:35,919 --> 01:01:39,502
lt's-lt's really amazing how much
of my life has been determined

882
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:41,915
by a quarter-inch piece of plastic, but...

883
01:01:43,385 --> 01:01:45,793
So, anyway,
she-she fell back over the door

884
01:01:45,888 --> 01:01:51,394
and hit her neck on the kitchen counter,
paralyzing her from the waist down.

885
01:01:51,478 --> 01:01:53,766
Wow.

886
01:01:53,855 --> 01:01:56,014
Still want to compare fucked-up families?

887
01:01:56,107 --> 01:01:59,358
But your mom was in
the wheelchair long before you left.

888
01:01:59,444 --> 01:02:02,281
Yeah. Well, l was nine.

889
01:02:02,365 --> 01:02:05,153
So, they sent me to therapy
and put me on these drugs

890
01:02:05,243 --> 01:02:07,365
that were supposed to curb my anger.

891
01:02:07,453 --> 01:02:10,490
And l've been on some
form of them since.

892
01:02:11,624 --> 01:02:14,959
And when l was 1 6, my psychiatrist dad
came around to the conclusion

893
01:02:15,046 --> 01:02:17,881
that it probably wasn't the best
environment for me to be in.

894
01:02:17,965 --> 01:02:22,710
So, he sent me to boarding school,
and l haven't been home since.

895
01:02:22,803 --> 01:02:25,176
- Until now.
- For her funeral.

896
01:02:25,265 --> 01:02:28,551
Until now, for her funeral.

897
01:02:28,644 --> 01:02:32,227
l can't believe the retarded
quarterback's a pill popper.

898
01:02:34,442 --> 01:02:36,399
Jesse?

899
01:02:36,485 --> 01:02:39,321
Where's the sauna?

900
01:02:39,405 --> 01:02:41,897
- l'll show her.
- No, l got it.

901
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:43,237
No, you get her a towel.

902
01:02:47,415 --> 01:02:49,454
Want a ride, sweetheart?

903
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:05,428
- You're in it right now, aren't you?
- What do you mean?

904
01:03:05,517 --> 01:03:08,388
My mom always says that when l'm
working something out in my head.

905
01:03:08,478 --> 01:03:10,971
She's like, ''You're in it right now.''

906
01:03:11,066 --> 01:03:14,482
And l'm looking at you,
and you're telling me this story,

907
01:03:14,569 --> 01:03:18,732
and... you're definitely in it right now.

908
01:03:19,949 --> 01:03:22,524
l think you're right.
l am in it.

909
01:03:25,915 --> 01:03:28,489
Yeah, whatever.
Could we just change the subject, OK?

910
01:03:28,584 --> 01:03:31,372
Let's just talk about good stuff.

911
01:03:31,463 --> 01:03:34,250
Good stuff?

912
01:03:34,341 --> 01:03:38,042
Like ''glass half full'' shit.
What do you got?

913
01:03:38,136 --> 01:03:41,091
Got a little buzz.
l got that.

914
01:03:42,224 --> 01:03:44,716
- What you got?
- l got a little buzz goin'.

915
01:03:48,189 --> 01:03:50,312
And l like you.

916
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:59,822
So, there's that.

917
01:03:59,911 --> 01:04:01,867
l guess l have that.

918
01:04:08,337 --> 01:04:10,377
l can tap dance.
You want to see me tap dance?

919
01:04:10,464 --> 01:04:13,038
l would love to see you tap dance.

920
01:04:16,636 --> 01:04:22,012
So what if you catch me.
where would we land?

921
01:04:22,102 --> 01:04:27,642
In somebody's life for taking his hands

922
01:04:27,733 --> 01:04:33,072
See. I can tell

923
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:37,798
What are you doing?

924
01:05:37,894 --> 01:05:41,512
You collect Desert Storm trading cards?

925
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:44,441
Fuck, yeah.
Those things are collector's items, man.

926
01:05:44,525 --> 01:05:46,933
You have any idea how much
those are gonna be worth?

927
01:05:47,028 --> 01:05:49,698
- Really?
- Hell, yeah. That shit's an investment.

928
01:05:49,782 --> 01:05:51,609
l have lots of investments all over.

929
01:05:51,701 --> 01:05:55,780
One day l'm gonna sell all of them,
and just fuckin' live off of it.

930
01:05:55,871 --> 01:05:58,077
So, like, how much is this one worth?

931
01:05:58,165 --> 01:06:02,211
- Which?
- ''Night Vision Goggles.''

932
01:06:02,295 --> 01:06:05,665
l don't know. Mint?
Two, maybe three.

933
01:06:05,757 --> 01:06:07,834
- Dollars?
- Yeah.

934
01:06:07,927 --> 01:06:11,296
lt's too early. You don't sell yet.
Don't you know anything about investing?

935
01:06:11,389 --> 01:06:13,428
l'm gonna live off that shit.

936
01:06:13,516 --> 01:06:16,850
lf you have a complete set,
it's worth, like, thousands.

937
01:06:16,936 --> 01:06:18,514
So, do you have the complete set?

938
01:06:18,605 --> 01:06:21,641
Almost. The corners are bent
on my ''Friendly Fire,''

939
01:06:21,733 --> 01:06:23,607
and someone stole my ''Wolf Blitzer.''

940
01:06:29,617 --> 01:06:31,574
Now, look. What do you got to do today?

941
01:06:31,661 --> 01:06:35,197
'Cause, uh... l got you
a little going-away present,

942
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:39,868
but, uh... l got to kinda track it down first.

943
01:06:39,961 --> 01:06:44,670
- So, can you give me a ride?
- Uh, yeah. l just...

944
01:06:44,758 --> 01:06:47,511
What?

945
01:06:47,595 --> 01:06:50,679
- No, nothing. l just...
- Say it, speak.

946
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:57,976
l kind of told Sam l was gonna
hang out with her today, so...

947
01:06:58,065 --> 01:07:00,188
She can come.
l don't care.

948
01:07:19,171 --> 01:07:22,007
I could have been a sailor

949
01:07:22,091 --> 01:07:24,298
Could have been a cook

950
01:07:27,597 --> 01:07:29,673
A real live lover

951
01:07:29,766 --> 01:07:31,926
Could have been a book

952
01:07:35,814 --> 01:07:39,978
I could have been a signpost

953
01:07:40,069 --> 01:07:42,608
Could have been a clock

954
01:07:43,782 --> 01:07:45,822
As simple as a kettle

955
01:07:45,909 --> 01:07:48,660
Steady as a rock

956
01:07:51,665 --> 01:07:55,367
I could be here and now

957
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:03,291
I would be. I should be.
but how ?

958
01:08:03,386 --> 01:08:07,136
l can't believe
we're in fuckin' Handi-World.

959
01:08:07,224 --> 01:08:09,466
We're getting money.
Don't look guilty.

960
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:13,261
- How do l look guilty?
- Andrew Largeman?

961
01:08:13,356 --> 01:08:15,313
- Oh, no. Benson.
- Oh, no.

962
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,393
- Who's that?
- Don't give him your number.

963
01:08:17,485 --> 01:08:19,893
Hey, man, what's up?

964
01:08:19,988 --> 01:08:21,482
- Holy shit!
- How's it going?

965
01:08:21,573 --> 01:08:24,610
l haven't seen you since, like, junior year.

966
01:08:24,701 --> 01:08:26,778
l thought you killed yourself.

967
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:29,279
What?

968
01:08:29,374 --> 01:08:32,825
l thought you killed yourself.
That wasn't you?

969
01:08:32,919 --> 01:08:35,208
No, no. That wasn't me.

970
01:08:35,296 --> 01:08:37,419
Who killed themselves?

971
01:08:37,507 --> 01:08:40,260
That was the Gleason kid.
Oh, and Tina.

972
01:08:40,344 --> 01:08:42,302
- Tina who?
- You remember Tina.

973
01:08:42,388 --> 01:08:44,380
She was anorexic, did gymnastics...

974
01:08:44,473 --> 01:08:47,308
- Oh, gymnastics Tina? How'd she do it?
- l don't know.

975
01:08:47,393 --> 01:08:50,478
- She wasn't Jewish. l didn't bury her.
- l think it was sleeping pills.

976
01:08:50,564 --> 01:08:53,233
Or that car-in-the-garage thing. l forgot.

977
01:08:55,945 --> 01:08:58,317
Oh, sorry.
This is Sam, Karl. Karl, Sam.

978
01:08:58,405 --> 01:08:59,947
- Hey.
- Hey.

979
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:02,570
l got to go find that thing.
You stay here. l'll be back.

980
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:04,819
ls-ls it heavy, or...? OK.

981
01:09:04,913 --> 01:09:06,621
Weren't you on a TV show or something?

982
01:09:06,706 --> 01:09:09,079
Yeah, it was just this, just this show.

983
01:09:09,167 --> 01:09:11,575
So you're, like, working here?
That's cool.

984
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:14,671
Only for a little while.
l'm opening my own business.

985
01:09:14,757 --> 01:09:16,833
Actually, l should talk to you about it.

986
01:09:16,926 --> 01:09:20,971
l'm looking for smart people like you,
Large. l should get your number.

987
01:09:21,055 --> 01:09:24,306
Yeah, definitely.
That'd be, that'd be cool.

988
01:09:24,393 --> 01:09:29,220
l'd like to talk to you - both -
about a good opportunity

989
01:09:29,314 --> 01:09:31,722
for you and your loved ones.

990
01:09:31,817 --> 01:09:34,308
We all have dreams.
l know l do.

991
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:38,568
l'd like to talk to you about an exciting
opportunity that people are talking about.

992
01:09:38,658 --> 01:09:41,742
- We got to get going.
- Oh, OK. lt was good to see you, Karl.

993
01:09:41,828 --> 01:09:44,401
- l should get your number.
- Definitely. l'll call you,

994
01:09:44,497 --> 01:09:48,033
- 'cause l think he has it in his book.
- Nice to meet you.

995
01:09:48,127 --> 01:09:51,579
Why is it always the losers that
get caught up in the pyramid schemes?

996
01:09:51,673 --> 01:09:55,089
Why can't it be some charming, hot girl
nagging you incessantly to buy shit?

997
01:09:55,175 --> 01:09:58,711
- ls that what he's doing?
- Yeah, it's detergent or some shit.

998
01:09:58,805 --> 01:10:01,890
Why are you buying knives?
l don't need knives.

999
01:10:01,975 --> 01:10:04,846
- l'd like to return these.
- You got a receipt?

1000
01:10:04,937 --> 01:10:07,393
Actually, no.
They were a gift.

1001
01:10:07,481 --> 01:10:10,851
- Why are you returning these?
- They're not sharp enough.

1002
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:14,609
- They're not sharp enough?
- No, not for what we need them for.

1003
01:10:14,697 --> 01:10:16,856
They couldn't cut cans.

1004
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:18,907
You bought them to cut cans?

1005
01:10:18,994 --> 01:10:22,198
No, but in the commercial it said
if l wanted to cut cans, l could.

1006
01:10:22,290 --> 01:10:25,243
- But with these knives, l can't.
- Well, it comes with a sharpener.

1007
01:10:25,334 --> 01:10:27,790
- Did you try it?
- Yeah.

1008
01:10:27,878 --> 01:10:30,417
They're just...

1009
01:10:30,506 --> 01:10:33,343
l don't want them.
They're not sharp enough.

1010
01:10:33,427 --> 01:10:35,420
OK.

1011
01:10:37,348 --> 01:10:39,589
A major loophole
in the Handi-World return policy

1012
01:10:39,683 --> 01:10:43,729
is that they permit returns
without receipts on items below $40.

1013
01:10:43,813 --> 01:10:46,020
So, how often do you go?

1014
01:10:46,107 --> 01:10:50,105
l hit every employee once,
and then l wait till they hire new ones.

1015
01:10:50,195 --> 01:10:53,729
Luckily, nobody stays at Handi-World
very long, except Karl Benson.

1016
01:10:53,823 --> 01:10:57,656
Mark, it's my last day in town. lf you
need money, l could loan you some--

1017
01:10:57,745 --> 01:10:59,619
l don't need your money.
l'm making my own.

1018
01:10:59,705 --> 01:11:01,497
Take Jesse's.
The guy's a millionaire.

1019
01:11:01,582 --> 01:11:06,126
l don't take anybody's money, OK?
l make my own. Favors are bad news.

1020
01:11:06,212 --> 01:11:11,124
The only thing worse than a favor
is a favor involving money, OK?

1021
01:11:11,218 --> 01:11:14,753
Let's go. l got to see a guy
about a nitrous tank.

1022
01:11:29,697 --> 01:11:32,449
Too low to find my way

1023
01:11:32,534 --> 01:11:35,238
Too high to wonder why

1024
01:11:35,327 --> 01:11:37,534
I've touched this place before

1025
01:11:37,621 --> 01:11:40,195
Somewhere in another time

1026
01:11:40,292 --> 01:11:42,866
Now I can hear the sun

1027
01:11:42,962 --> 01:11:45,667
The clouds drifting through the blinds

1028
01:11:45,756 --> 01:11:48,164
A half a million thoughts

1029
01:11:48,259 --> 01:11:51,628
Are flowing through my mind

1030
01:11:59,021 --> 01:12:01,346
What is this place?

1031
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,646
l think you can see into hotel rooms.

1032
01:12:03,734 --> 01:12:06,272
Come on, tough guy!
Come on, tough guy!

1033
01:12:06,362 --> 01:12:08,355
Shut up!

1034
01:12:12,368 --> 01:12:16,319
Yeah. Oh. oh! Yeah!

1035
01:12:31,806 --> 01:12:34,013
l'm gonna fucking cum!

1036
01:12:37,563 --> 01:12:40,055
That shit was hot.
That shit was hot.

1037
01:12:40,149 --> 01:12:42,475
l got to go drop some knowledge
on that ho right there.

1038
01:12:42,569 --> 01:12:47,064
- How do you know she's a hooker?
- Of course she's a fuckin' hooker.

1039
01:12:47,156 --> 01:12:50,158
Girls who look like her
do not fuck guys that look like him

1040
01:12:50,244 --> 01:12:53,031
unless it's for coke, money, or fame.

1041
01:12:53,122 --> 01:12:56,206
Well, Julia Roberts married Lyle Lovett.

1042
01:12:56,292 --> 01:12:59,792
- Who the fuck are you?
- This is Sam, this is Large.

1043
01:12:59,879 --> 01:13:03,083
No offense, man, but why you
bringing these fucking people here?

1044
01:13:03,174 --> 01:13:06,092
This is the guy who needs that thing.

1045
01:13:06,178 --> 01:13:10,389
l brought you the tank, 'K?
Could you just tell us where to go now?

1046
01:13:10,474 --> 01:13:13,974
- That thing come with balloons?
- What am l, a fucking birthday clown?

1047
01:13:14,061 --> 01:13:17,561
No, it doesn't come with balloons, OK?
Suck it off the tap.

1048
01:13:17,648 --> 01:13:20,353
And l need it back,
'cause that guy's holding my 39 bucks.

1049
01:13:20,443 --> 01:13:23,279
All right, hold up. Hold up!

1050
01:13:23,364 --> 01:13:25,606
Who here just saw some titties?

1051
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:28,534
Raise your hand
if you just saw some titties.

1052
01:13:28,619 --> 01:13:30,576
Hmm?

1053
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:37,246
Thank you.
So everybody, just calm the fuck down.

1054
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:41,999
Now... you know where
Kiernan's Quarry is?

1055
01:13:42,092 --> 01:13:44,665
- Down in Newark. right?
- Yeah.

1056
01:13:44,761 --> 01:13:46,885
It's at the bottom
of Hillside and Rivington.

1057
01:13:46,973 --> 01:13:49,381
Can't really see it from the street.
but it's there.

1058
01:13:49,475 --> 01:13:52,311
Park your car at the gate
and hop the fence.

1059
01:13:52,395 --> 01:13:57,022
At the bottom of the quarry. there's
a junkyard run by this guy named Albert.

1060
01:13:57,109 --> 01:14:00,193
He's the one that tracked down
the piece you're looking for. all right?

1061
01:14:00,279 --> 01:14:02,687
I'll call him right now
and tell him to expect you.

1062
01:14:02,781 --> 01:14:04,774
OK, stop.

1063
01:14:04,867 --> 01:14:07,239
- What the fuck are we doing?
- Just be patient, man.

1064
01:14:07,328 --> 01:14:10,615
We've been patient all day,
but it's my last day in town.

1065
01:14:10,707 --> 01:14:13,459
lf you told me we're going on scavenger
hunt for blow, l would've passed.

1066
01:14:13,543 --> 01:14:15,999
Please. lf l was gonna get you coke,
we would've gone

1067
01:14:16,088 --> 01:14:19,956
to the high school football practice.
We'd have been rolling five hours ago.

1068
01:14:20,051 --> 01:14:22,091
We've corrupted
this innocent girl enough.

1069
01:14:22,178 --> 01:14:25,179
- l'm not innocent.
- You are. That's what l like about you.

1070
01:14:25,264 --> 01:14:28,716
l don't want this guy taking you to some
sketchy quarry in the middle of nowhere

1071
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:31,480
to find, like, crack whores
huffing turpentine

1072
01:14:31,564 --> 01:14:35,265
or pit bulls raping each other,
or whatever it is you have us doing.

1073
01:14:36,069 --> 01:14:40,315
Wow. That's, like, the most worked up
l've ever seen you.

1074
01:14:40,406 --> 01:14:44,072
- He was protecting me.
- So?

1075
01:14:44,161 --> 01:14:47,328
- He likes me.
- Don't be cute.

1076
01:14:47,414 --> 01:14:49,740
He's my knight in shining armor.

1077
01:14:49,833 --> 01:14:53,167
Don't talk about knights in front of Mark.
lt's a sore subject.

1078
01:14:53,254 --> 01:14:56,789
l'm gonna kill that motherfucker.

1079
01:14:56,883 --> 01:14:58,757
Pun intended?

1080
01:14:58,843 --> 01:15:00,468
Oh, you're--

1081
01:15:04,057 --> 01:15:06,051
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1082
01:15:10,648 --> 01:15:12,605
Oh, my God.

1083
01:15:12,691 --> 01:15:15,562
- Wow.
- l never even knew this was here.

1084
01:15:15,653 --> 01:15:18,572
l've heard about it.
They were supposed to build a mall here.

1085
01:15:18,657 --> 01:15:20,864
l remember reading about that
in the paper.

1086
01:15:20,951 --> 01:15:24,948
They were digging or something, and
they break into this natural phenomenon.

1087
01:15:25,038 --> 01:15:27,744
lt's like an underground
Grand Canyon or something.

1088
01:15:27,834 --> 01:15:30,918
Now they're in some huge legal battle
over whether they can build here.

1089
01:15:31,004 --> 01:15:33,756
Can you imagine the guy
whose job it is to fight for his right

1090
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,754
to build a mall on some, like,
geological phenomenon?

1091
01:15:37,844 --> 01:15:42,424
They love their malls here, man. All right,
let's find this guy and get out of here.

1092
01:15:42,516 --> 01:15:44,593
You're not gonna tell us
what we're getting?

1093
01:15:44,685 --> 01:15:48,470
- lt's a surprise. You'll see.
- l think it's gonna rain.

1094
01:15:54,446 --> 01:15:56,439
So, this is it.

1095
01:15:58,075 --> 01:16:03,118
So, knock. Knock and barter
for Desert Storm trading cards.

1096
01:16:03,206 --> 01:16:06,990
Don't tease me about my hobbies.
l don't tease you about being an asshole.

1097
01:16:09,045 --> 01:16:11,371
OK.

1098
01:16:22,518 --> 01:16:24,891
- Mark?
- Yeah. Albert?

1099
01:16:25,564 --> 01:16:26,939
Come on in.

1100
01:16:31,529 --> 01:16:36,772
Oh, man. You guys must be freezing.
Make yourselves warm by the fire.

1101
01:16:36,868 --> 01:16:39,620
l'm just gonna go put her down, OK?
l'll be right back out.

1102
01:16:46,253 --> 01:16:50,666
l must say... l'm continually impressed
with how each place you bring us to

1103
01:16:50,758 --> 01:16:53,878
- continues to be weirder and weirder.
- What do you mean? This is nice.

1104
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:57,671
Oh, nothing. Just hanging out in an old
boat at the bottom of a quarry in Newark.

1105
01:16:57,765 --> 01:16:59,890
lt's hardly the bottom, dude.

1106
01:16:59,977 --> 01:17:02,016
Did you check out that cliff down there?

1107
01:17:02,103 --> 01:17:06,102
Hey... this is my wife, Faye.

1108
01:17:06,191 --> 01:17:08,765
Hi. Welcome.

1109
01:17:08,861 --> 01:17:11,780
Please, have a seat.
Make yourselves comfortable.

1110
01:17:15,035 --> 01:17:19,115
- Man, it's really coming down out there.
- Yeah, it started pouring all of a sudden.

1111
01:17:19,205 --> 01:17:24,449
Well, in a bad storm, l like to pretend
that this old boat's my own private ark.

1112
01:17:24,545 --> 01:17:29,124
Unfortunately, if this is the apocalypse,
l'm not quite sure it still floats.

1113
01:17:30,676 --> 01:17:34,545
- Listen, would anybody like some tea?
- l'd love some, thank you.

1114
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,641
Do you want some tea?
OK, l'll be right back.

1115
01:17:38,769 --> 01:17:41,889
What is this place?
What is it that you do down here?

1116
01:17:41,981 --> 01:17:45,564
Well, we're calling it Kiernan's Fault.
No one knows what it is.

1117
01:17:45,652 --> 01:17:49,068
We haven't been able to explore it.
Meanwhile, while they're in litigation,

1118
01:17:49,155 --> 01:17:51,825
they hired me to make sure
no one comes inside.

1119
01:17:51,908 --> 01:17:53,735
Wow.

1120
01:17:53,827 --> 01:17:57,696
But what they don't know
is that at night, l climb down.

1121
01:17:57,790 --> 01:18:00,411
So how deep does it go?
Thank you.

1122
01:18:00,501 --> 01:18:03,253
You know - thank you -
no one really knows.

1123
01:18:03,337 --> 01:18:06,208
But l like to pretend it's infinite.

1124
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:10,879
lt's kind of an odd job -
guardian of an infinite abyss.

1125
01:18:10,972 --> 01:18:13,094
Yeah. Yeah, l guess it is.

1126
01:18:13,181 --> 01:18:15,851
But we also trade
and deal in antique jewelry.

1127
01:18:17,227 --> 01:18:21,096
l suppose it is odd
that we live down here like this.

1128
01:18:21,191 --> 01:18:24,109
- Not at all.
- lt never crossed my mind.

1129
01:18:24,194 --> 01:18:27,563
Well... we think it's important.

1130
01:18:27,655 --> 01:18:31,785
Why? What is it that
you think you're gonna find?

1131
01:18:31,869 --> 01:18:34,443
l guess l just like the idea
of discovering something -

1132
01:18:34,539 --> 01:18:39,960
of doing something that's completely
unique, that's never been done before.

1133
01:18:40,045 --> 01:18:43,129
- Albert's Abyss.
- Well, maybe. Who knows?

1134
01:18:43,215 --> 01:18:48,210
But you know what? That's all ego.
None of that really matters.

1135
01:18:48,304 --> 01:18:53,300
lf l get to be with this person right here,
and our beautiful baby...

1136
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,518
...that's all l need.

1137
01:19:00,984 --> 01:19:04,734
Well, l suppose you want what you
came all the way down here for.

1138
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:06,780
Oh, yeah.
That'd be great.

1139
01:19:06,866 --> 01:19:11,943
Now, it took me a while to track
this piece down, but l owe Diego huge.

1140
01:19:14,248 --> 01:19:16,326
That's it.
Thank you so much.

1141
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:18,660
- Yeah.
- Really.

1142
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:23,546
Listen, good luck in the rain. Do you guys
want some garbage bags or something?

1143
01:19:24,968 --> 01:19:27,508
- Yeah.
- OK. That actually would be great.

1144
01:19:30,851 --> 01:19:35,976
Tom. get your plane right on time

1145
01:19:36,732 --> 01:19:40,018
I know your part'll go fine

1146
01:19:40,111 --> 01:19:43,028
Goodbye!

1147
01:19:43,114 --> 01:19:46,151
- Hey, Albert!
- Yeah?

1148
01:19:47,035 --> 01:19:49,657
Good luck exploring the infinite abyss.

1149
01:19:49,747 --> 01:19:52,320
Thank you. Hey!

1150
01:19:54,668 --> 01:19:56,910
You, too.

1151
01:20:02,928 --> 01:20:07,589
I get the news.
I need on the weather report

1152
01:20:07,682 --> 01:20:13,722
Oh. I can gather all the news I need
on the weather report

1153
01:20:15,608 --> 01:20:22,145
Hey. I've got nothing
to do today but smile

1154
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:27,911
Da-do da-do doo-da.
and here I am

1155
01:20:27,997 --> 01:20:30,702
The only living boy in New York

1156
01:20:35,839 --> 01:20:39,588
Half of the time we're gone
but we don't know where

1157
01:20:39,676 --> 01:20:42,214
And we don't know where

1158
01:21:05,621 --> 01:21:09,620
Here I am

1159
01:21:09,710 --> 01:21:11,786
Whoo!

1160
01:21:16,633 --> 01:21:20,299
Half of the time we're gone
but we don't know where

1161
01:21:20,388 --> 01:21:24,468
And we don't know where

1162
01:21:24,559 --> 01:21:30,812
Tom. get your plane right on time

1163
01:21:30,899 --> 01:21:36,985
I know that you've
been eager to fly. now

1164
01:21:37,073 --> 01:21:42,828
Hey. let your honesty
shine. shine. shine. now

1165
01:21:42,913 --> 01:21:45,997
Da-do da-do doo-da doo-da

1166
01:21:46,082 --> 01:21:49,333
Like it shines on me

1167
01:21:49,419 --> 01:21:53,252
The only living boy in New York

1168
01:21:55,093 --> 01:21:58,462
The only living boy in New York

1169
01:22:07,607 --> 01:22:11,984
So... l don't know
if l'm gonna see you, man.

1170
01:22:13,946 --> 01:22:16,568
Don't you want to know
what's in the bag?

1171
01:22:17,743 --> 01:22:21,443
To be honest,
l don't even care anymore.

1172
01:22:27,295 --> 01:22:29,371
What is it?

1173
01:22:31,591 --> 01:22:34,212
lt's my mom's favorite necklace.

1174
01:22:34,302 --> 01:22:37,387
l'd be lying to you if l told you
it was my plan all along.

1175
01:22:37,472 --> 01:22:41,518
But... l got it back to you, right?
That's got to be worth something.

1176
01:22:43,771 --> 01:22:45,728
This whole day was about this?

1177
01:22:47,817 --> 01:22:51,234
You didn't want it down there with her.
lt's better it's with you.

1178
01:22:52,615 --> 01:22:54,275
OK.

1179
01:22:58,453 --> 01:23:02,155
Hey, if you ever need a Kato,
you know where to find me.

1180
01:23:17,016 --> 01:23:19,139
lt's funny, this...

1181
01:23:20,186 --> 01:23:24,136
This necklace reminds me of this really
random memory of my mother.

1182
01:23:26,526 --> 01:23:31,865
l was, l was a little kid, and l was crying
for one reason or another, and...

1183
01:23:35,954 --> 01:23:39,619
...she was just, like, you know, cradling
me and rocking me back and forth.

1184
01:23:39,707 --> 01:23:42,459
l can remember seeing
the little balls in this thing

1185
01:23:42,544 --> 01:23:45,498
just sort of floating back and forth, and...

1186
01:23:48,051 --> 01:23:51,550
And there was just, like, snot
dripping down my nose, right?

1187
01:23:51,638 --> 01:23:56,050
And, uh...
she gave me her sleeve...

1188
01:23:57,476 --> 01:23:59,933
...and she told me
to blow my nose into it.

1189
01:24:05,862 --> 01:24:08,731
And l remember thinking,
even as a little kid,

1190
01:24:09,573 --> 01:24:11,567
''Wow.

1191
01:24:15,122 --> 01:24:17,114
This is love.''

1192
01:24:20,627 --> 01:24:23,000
This is love.

1193
01:24:24,131 --> 01:24:26,504
Large.

1194
01:24:26,592 --> 01:24:29,297
- l think l see one.
- Shut up.

1195
01:24:29,387 --> 01:24:32,174
Yeah, l do.
Wait, we should save it or something.

1196
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:39,097
OK, don't move. OK.

1197
01:24:42,943 --> 01:24:46,479
We could put it in my scrapbook,
if l had a scrapbook.

1198
01:24:46,573 --> 01:24:48,862
- That it?
- l think so.

1199
01:24:48,951 --> 01:24:52,153
l don't really feel any more coming.

1200
01:24:52,245 --> 01:24:55,366
Well, if you do, just let me know.
l'll get the cup, OK?

1201
01:24:56,709 --> 01:24:59,082
This was such a good idea.

1202
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:01,661
- Who are you?
- l'm your new friend, Sam.

1203
01:25:03,049 --> 01:25:04,163
Tissue?

1204
01:25:08,931 --> 01:25:10,390
Come here.

1205
01:25:20,735 --> 01:25:23,061
Fuck, this hurts so much.

1206
01:25:23,154 --> 01:25:25,147
Yeah, l know.

1207
01:25:26,158 --> 01:25:29,575
But that is life.

1208
01:25:29,663 --> 01:25:32,331
lf nothing else, that's life, you know?

1209
01:25:32,414 --> 01:25:34,407
lt's real.

1210
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:37,501
Sometimes it fuckin' hurts.

1211
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:42,501
To be honest, it's sort of all we have.

1212
01:25:46,055 --> 01:25:47,632
Hmm.

1213
01:25:51,810 --> 01:25:53,769
How are you feelin'?

1214
01:25:56,275 --> 01:25:58,267
Safe.

1215
01:26:00,653 --> 01:26:03,276
When l'm with you, l feel so safe.

1216
01:26:05,868 --> 01:26:07,861
Like l'm home.

1217
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:17,745
They will see us waving

1218
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:22,835
From such great heights

1219
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:27,675
''Come down now . ''

1220
01:26:27,768 --> 01:26:33,853
They'll say

1221
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:37,986
But everything looks perfect

1222
01:26:38,071 --> 01:26:42,199
From far away...

1223
01:26:54,255 --> 01:26:56,829
- Dad.
- Yeah.

1224
01:26:56,925 --> 01:26:59,166
Ha.

1225
01:26:59,259 --> 01:27:01,218
Come on in.

1226
01:27:01,304 --> 01:27:04,175
- l'm sorry l woke you up.
- No, no. l was just reading.

1227
01:27:05,559 --> 01:27:08,762
Where have you been?

1228
01:27:08,854 --> 01:27:10,681
Everywhere.

1229
01:27:10,773 --> 01:27:13,691
l've been on sort of a crazy journey
these last couple days.

1230
01:27:13,776 --> 01:27:15,852
You've been avoiding me.

1231
01:27:15,945 --> 01:27:18,697
No, l haven't been.
Come on.

1232
01:27:20,909 --> 01:27:23,864
OK, maybe l have been.

1233
01:27:23,955 --> 01:27:28,663
l'm sure you can find
lots of things in your life

1234
01:27:28,751 --> 01:27:30,708
that you can be angry about.

1235
01:27:30,795 --> 01:27:35,007
But what l do not understand
is why you're so angry at me.

1236
01:27:35,092 --> 01:27:37,500
All l ever wanted was
for everyone to be happy again.

1237
01:27:37,595 --> 01:27:40,429
- That's all l ever wanted.
- When were we all ever happy, Dad?

1238
01:27:40,513 --> 01:27:42,839
You always say that.
l mean, when was that?

1239
01:27:42,933 --> 01:27:46,683
What was this time that we were all so
happy? l don't have it in my memory.

1240
01:27:46,771 --> 01:27:51,683
Maybe if l did, l could help
steer us back there, but l just...

1241
01:27:51,777 --> 01:27:56,023
You know, you and l need to work on
being OK, if that's not in the cards for us.

1242
01:27:58,409 --> 01:28:03,404
Well, we might have a shot at it, if you
can forgive yourself for what you did.

1243
01:28:04,624 --> 01:28:08,373
What l did.
What l did.

1244
01:28:08,461 --> 01:28:10,917
OK. Let's do it, OK?
We're here, right?

1245
01:28:11,006 --> 01:28:14,173
Let's do it. l'm gonna forgive myself
for what l did. Are you ready?

1246
01:28:14,259 --> 01:28:18,803
l was a little boy,
and somebody made a shitty latch.

1247
01:28:18,889 --> 01:28:21,642
That's what l think
about the whole thing, OK?

1248
01:28:21,727 --> 01:28:24,478
And l'm not gonna take those drugs
anymore. They left me numb.

1249
01:28:24,562 --> 01:28:28,227
l have felt so fucking numb to everything
l've experienced in my life, OK?

1250
01:28:28,316 --> 01:28:30,309
And for that...

1251
01:28:31,279 --> 01:28:33,852
...for that l'm here to forgive you.

1252
01:28:33,948 --> 01:28:38,823
You've always said all you wanted was
for us to have whatever it is we wanted.

1253
01:28:38,911 --> 01:28:42,613
Well, maybe what Mom wanted more
than anything was for it to all be over.

1254
01:28:45,836 --> 01:28:50,249
And for me... what l want more
than anything in the world

1255
01:28:50,341 --> 01:28:53,377
is for it to be OK with you
for me to feel something again...

1256
01:28:54,804 --> 01:28:56,761
...even if it's pain.

1257
01:28:58,308 --> 01:29:01,060
Going against
your doctor's recommendation

1258
01:29:01,144 --> 01:29:03,980
is a pretty weighty experiment
to take on, don't you think?

1259
01:29:09,111 --> 01:29:11,353
This is my life, Dad.

1260
01:29:12,156 --> 01:29:14,149
This is it.

1261
01:29:14,242 --> 01:29:16,699
l've spent 26 years waiting
for something else to start.

1262
01:29:16,787 --> 01:29:21,864
So, no. l don't think it's too much to take
on, because it's everything there is.

1263
01:29:21,958 --> 01:29:24,200
l see now it's all there is.

1264
01:29:28,341 --> 01:29:30,749
You and l are gonna be OK.
You know that, right?

1265
01:29:37,559 --> 01:29:41,889
We may not be as happy as you
always dreamed we would be, but...

1266
01:29:45,485 --> 01:29:48,022
...for the first time,
let's just allow ourselves

1267
01:29:48,112 --> 01:29:50,651
to be whatever it is that we are.

1268
01:29:53,368 --> 01:29:55,326
And that will be better, OK?

1269
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:02,335
l think that will be better.

1270
01:30:22,442 --> 01:30:25,064
What are you thinking about?

1271
01:30:25,154 --> 01:30:27,111
You're not coming back, are you?

1272
01:30:27,198 --> 01:30:29,867
- Come on, Sam. Of course l am.
- No, you're not.

1273
01:30:29,951 --> 01:30:31,907
You don't realize this is good.

1274
01:30:31,994 --> 01:30:34,745
This doesn't happen often in your life,
you know?

1275
01:30:34,830 --> 01:30:37,156
l mean, this...

1276
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:39,576
We can work this stuff out.

1277
01:30:39,670 --> 01:30:42,291
l want to help you, you know?

1278
01:30:42,381 --> 01:30:46,592
We need each other.
l haven't even lied in, like, two days.

1279
01:30:46,676 --> 01:30:49,003
ls that true?

1280
01:30:49,096 --> 01:30:51,089
No.

1281
01:30:54,477 --> 01:30:58,807
Look, this isn't, this isn't a conversation
about this being over.

1282
01:30:58,899 --> 01:31:03,775
lt's-lt's... l'm not, like, putting a period
at the end of this, you know?

1283
01:31:03,862 --> 01:31:06,780
l'm putting, like, an ellipsis on it.

1284
01:31:06,866 --> 01:31:09,618
'Cause l'm worried that
if l don't go figure myself out,

1285
01:31:09,702 --> 01:31:11,660
if l don't go land on my own two feet,

1286
01:31:11,747 --> 01:31:16,076
then l'm just gonna fuck this whole
thing up, and this is too important.

1287
01:31:20,922 --> 01:31:23,960
l got to go.
l... l got to go.

1288
01:31:26,137 --> 01:31:29,054
l fired my psychiatrist.
l got to go find a new one.

1289
01:31:31,726 --> 01:31:34,135
Look, l'm gonna call you
when l get there.

1290
01:31:35,689 --> 01:31:37,848
l'm gonna call you, and...

1291
01:31:43,864 --> 01:31:45,858
Look at me.

1292
01:31:48,245 --> 01:31:50,237
Look at me.

1293
01:31:57,546 --> 01:31:59,954
You changed my life.

1294
01:32:06,348 --> 01:32:10,298
You changed my life,
and l've known you four days.

1295
01:32:14,231 --> 01:32:16,853
This is the beginning
of something really big.

1296
01:32:19,530 --> 01:32:21,487
But right now, l've got to go.

1297
01:32:29,081 --> 01:32:30,624
Come here.

1298
01:33:12,754 --> 01:33:15,211
Drink up. baby. down

1299
01:33:15,299 --> 01:33:19,428
Mmm. are you in or are you out?

1300
01:33:19,512 --> 01:33:22,085
Leave your things behind

1301
01:33:22,181 --> 01:33:26,096
'Cause it's all going off without you

1302
01:33:26,186 --> 01:33:32,770
Excuse me.
too busy writing your tragedy

1303
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:36,145
These mishaps you bubble wrap

1304
01:33:36,238 --> 01:33:40,319
When you've no idea what you're like

1305
01:33:46,082 --> 01:33:48,574
Take your seats as quickly as possible.

1306
01:33:59,847 --> 01:34:02,885
- What are you doing?
- Do you remember that idea l had

1307
01:34:02,977 --> 01:34:06,310
about working stuff out,
then finding you once l figured stuff out?

1308
01:34:06,396 --> 01:34:09,101
- The ellipsis?
- Yeah, the ellipsis. lt's dumb.

1309
01:34:09,191 --> 01:34:11,349
lt's an awful idea,
and l'm not gonna do it, OK?

1310
01:34:11,443 --> 01:34:13,437
'Cause like you said, this is it.

1311
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:15,439
This is life.

1312
01:34:15,532 --> 01:34:17,571
And l'm in love with you, Samantha.

1313
01:34:18,910 --> 01:34:22,361
l think that's the only thing l've ever
been really sure of in my entire life.

1314
01:34:22,455 --> 01:34:25,825
l'm really messed up right now,
and l've got a lot of stuff to work out,

1315
01:34:25,918 --> 01:34:29,003
but l don't want to waste any more
of my life without you in it, OK?

1316
01:34:29,088 --> 01:34:31,543
- Yeah.
- And l think l can do this. l want to.

1317
01:34:31,632 --> 01:34:33,375
- We have to, right?
- Yeah.

1318
01:34:33,467 --> 01:34:35,508
- Right?
- Yes!

1319
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:40,133
So, what do we do?

1320
01:34:45,565 --> 01:34:47,890
What do we do?
