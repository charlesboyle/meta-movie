160
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,771
Yes. In America, that's a very popular joke.

00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,315
- Do you have a mother-in-law joke?

00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,828
- You had sex with your mother-in-law?

166
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,372

and hardship for a lot of families.

178
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:35,920
Sometime my sister, she show her
vagina to my brother, Bilo, and say,

179
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,758
"You will never get this!
You will never get this!"

180
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,094
He behind his cage, crazy, crazy.
Everybody laugh.

181
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,013
She go, "You never get this!"

182
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:49,601
But one time,
he break cage and he get this.

183
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,186
And then we all laugh.

184
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,645
High five!

185
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,523
Now...

186
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,781
No, that would not be funny
in America, okay?

187
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,825
What is "not" jokes?

188
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,704
A "not" joke is when we're trying
to make fun of something

189
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,917
and what we do is we make
a statement that we pretend is true

190
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:17,754
but, at the end, we say, "Not,"
which means it's not true.

191
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,172
So teach me how to make one.

192
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,258
- All right, what color is your suit?
- This suit is gray.

193
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,927
Gray, I would call it blue, okay?

194
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,553
- It's gray.
- All right, it's blue-gray.

195
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,306
But it's certainly not black, right?

196
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,100
- Let's say it's gray, but...
- It is gray.

197
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,146
Okay, so a "not" joke, I would say

198
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,149
"That suit is black. Not!"

199
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,486
This suit is not black.

200
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,322
- No, no, "Not" has to be the end.
- Oh, okay.

201
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,533
This suit is black not.

202
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,452
This suit is black, pause...
You know what a pause is?

203
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,831
- Yes.
- This suit is black. Not!

204
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:56,167
This suit is black. Pause. Not.

205
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,253
No, you don't say "pause."

206
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,088
This suit is black.

207
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,174
That's a pause. Not!

208
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,635
This suit is black.

209
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,930
Okay...

210
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,850
- I don't... I'm not...
- Not!

211
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,858
Everybody say U.S.A.
television much better

212
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,986
but this I watch for three hours,
do not change.

213
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,696
There's a remote control here.

214
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,282
Push these two arrows
to change the channel.
(man screaming)

215
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,536
I got him, I got him, I got him!

216
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,707
I have the urge to bury something else.

217
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,875
Yes!

218
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:42,171
- I love you.
- I love you too, Jamie.

219
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,965
I love you.

220
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,905
- Do you believe in magic, Miss...
- Parker, C.J.

221
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,699
It's a pleasure to meet you, C.J.

222
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,915
Be careful! Be careful, C.J.!

223
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:21,753
This C.J. was like no
Kazakh woman I had ever seen.

224
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:26,758
She had golden hairs,
teeth as white as pearls

225
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,344
and the asshole of a 7-year-old.

226
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,389
For the first time in my lifes,

227
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,099
l was in love.

228
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,266
(choir chanting)

229
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,837
(horn blows)

230
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,689
Get up! Get up!

231
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,900
Why aren't you ready!

232
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,652
We have people to interview today.

233
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,736
I understand.

234
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,948
Learn what you can from
this women's group.

235
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,951
- My hair?
- It's beautiful. Don't worry.

236
00:15:55,871 --> 00:16:00,541
In Kazakhstan it is illegal for more than
five woman to be in the same place

237
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,419
except for in brothel or in grave.

238
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:07,840
In the U.S. and A., many womens meet
in groups called Feminists.

239
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,175
I find more.

240
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,804
VETERAN FEMINISTS
OF AMERICA

241
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,806
So, what means this feminism?

242
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,811
It's the theory that women
should be equal to men

243
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:23,314
in matters economic, social...

244
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,650
- Now you are laughing.
- Yes.

245
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,652
Well, that is the problem.

246
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,363
Do you think a woman should be educate?

247
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,739
Definitely.

248
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:36,160
But is it not a problem that a woman
have a smaller brain than a man?

249
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,495
That is wrong.

250
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:41,457
But the government scientist,
Dr. Yamak, prove it's the size of squirrel.

251
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,251
Your government's scientist?

252
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,045
- Yes, Dr. Yamak.
- He's wrong. He's wrong.

253
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,589
Give me a smile, baby. Why angry face?

254
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,552
Well, what you're saying
is very demeaning.

255
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,263
- Do you know the word "demeaning"?
- No.

256
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,181
We are saying to you...

257
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:01,144
l could not concentrate on what
this old man was saying.

258
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:07,900
All I could think about was this
lovely woman in her red water-panties.

259
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,028
Who was this C.J.?

260
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,614
Last night I see in my hotel room

261
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,452
a woman called C.J. on the television.

262
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,537
- Do you know her?
- No.

263
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,915
She from a town called Baywatches.

264
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,710
- She's just on television.
- Her name is Pamela.

265
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,713
- Do she live here in New York City?
- She lives in California.

266
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,215
- In the California.
- He's gonna look her up.

267
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,800
Okay, can we finish now?

268
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,677
Listen, pussycat, smile a bit.

269
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,431
- All right. That's it. I'm done.
- We're finished. We have to leave.

270
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:45,897
Although I was obsessed
by this C.J., I could not pursue her

271
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,816
or else my wife would snap off my cock.

272
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,156
Mr. Sagdiyev?

273
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,034
- Yes?
- I have a telegram for you.

274
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,661
- You can read?
- Yes, I can.

275
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,457
"Dear Borat Sagdiyev,

276
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,376
"your wife, Oxna,

277
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:12,965
"was walking your retarded Bilo
in the woods

278
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,886
"when a bear attacked
and violated and break her.

279
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,263
"She is now dead."

280
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,766
You say my wife is dead?

281
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,852
This is what it's...

282
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:36,405
Yes, sir. I'm sorry to inform you,
but that's what the telegram says.

283
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,951
High five! Great!

284
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,426
What do you mean, California?

285
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,304
I have arranged all our filming
for New York.

286
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,641
But we need to leave New York
to find the real America:

287
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:07,103
rodeos, cowboys...
It will be better for our documentary.

288
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,647
But why California?
What's there?

289
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,402
Pearl Harbor is there...
And so is Texas.

290
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:19,240
Eventually, I persuade Azamat
that we would travel to California

291
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,076
and make our reportings along the way.

292
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:28,082
He insists we not fly in case the Jews
repeated their attack of 9/11.

293
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,586
Okay, I'll find another way
for us to get there.

294
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,463
My name is Mike.
I'm gonna be your driving instructor.

295
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,007
MICHAEL PSENICSKA
Perry Hall Driving School

296
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,091
Welcome to our country, okay.

297
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,634
- My name Borat.
- Okay, okay. Good, good.

298
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,262
Well, I'm not used to that,
but that's fine.

299
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,599
Now, you do know how to drive a little bit?

300
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,226
- Yes.
- Yes. Put it in D.

301
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,520
- What?
- Drive.

302
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,818
Now, wait a second. Wait a second.

303
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,738
- Have you driven a car before?
- Yes, many times.

304
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,156
All right, let's go this way.

305
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,491
I don't want you hitting anybody.

306
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,285
Use two hands, now.

307
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,121
- What?
- Two hands.

308
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,374
But then it look like I am holding
a Gypsy while he eat my chram.

309
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,836
I don't care.
You use two hands when you drive, okay?

310
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,463
Okay.

311
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,094
- Okay.
- Watch the children.

312
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,096
Okay, no problem.

313
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,807
You must not hit the children.

314
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,893
Look, there is a woman in a car.

315
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,186
Can we follow her?

316
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,647
- And maybe make sexy-time with her?
- No, no, no.

317
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,649
- Let's get her. Why not?
- No, no, no.

318
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,861
Because a woman has a right
to choose who she has sex with.

319
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,364
- What? You joke?
- How about that? Isn't that amazing?

320
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,575
There must be consent. How about that?

321
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,661
That's good, huh?

322
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,622
- Is not good for me.
- It is good.

323
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,582
- Steer the car.
- Okay.

324
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,085
- You want have a drink?
- You can't drink that.

325
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,754
- Why not? What?
- It's against the law.

326
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,884
Who is this car that follow us?
I wish it didn't follow us.

327
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,761
- I don't know.
- Maybe we'll lose them.

328
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,680
No, we better not lose them.

329
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,725
Hey, don't look at me. Eat my tits!

330
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,602
We'll make a right turn up here.

331
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,855
Don't look at me like that.
I will eat your shit.

332
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,983
- Hey, you fuck my mother!
- Hey, hey.

333
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,610
- No, he do before. He look on me.
- You can't do that.

334
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,154
They're gonna throw us in jail,
me with you.

335
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,782
Why in a jail? He look on me.

336
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,285
- Behind.
- You can't say that.

337
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,953
I like you, do you like me?

338
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,539
- I do like you.
- You are my friend?

339
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,624
You're nice and I am your friend.

340
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,001
You will be my boyfriend?

341
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,379
- I won't be your boyfriend.
- Why not? You do not like me?

342
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,841
I could be. It depends.
Well, boyfriend, yeah, I can.

343
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,468
Great success.

344
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,638
Now time to make purchase of motorcars.

345
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:52,018
I want to have a car that attract
a woman with a shave down below.

346
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,937
Well, that would be a Corvette
or a Hummer.

347
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,188
JIM SELL
GM Salesman

348
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,399

349
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:03,529
A man yesterday tell me if I buy a car

350
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,823
I must buy one with a pussy magnet.

351
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,783
He means a car that women will like.

352
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,994
Yes, but where you keep this magnet?

353
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,830
No, there's no magnet. That was just...
He means the vehicle.

354
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,248
Women love the Hummers.

355
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,834
- Do this have a pussy magnet?
- No.

356
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,586
The vehicle itself will be a magnet.

357
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:24,050
If I give you good price,
will you please put in pussy magnet?

358
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:28,054
Yeah, but there's no such thing
in this country as a magnet.

359
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,974
If this car drive into a group of Gypsy,

360
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,185
will there be any damage to the car?

361
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,188
- It depends on how hard you hit them.
- Hard.

362
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,689
Yeah, hard. You might,

363
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:42,526
if somebody rolls on the windshield,
crack your windshield.

364
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,863
How fast do I need to go
to guarantee I kill him?

365
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,824
Let me tell you something,
with this vehicle, probably doing 35,

366
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,369
- 40 miles an hour would do it.
- Great.

367
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:55,122
When I buy my wife,

368
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,376
at the start, she was cook good,

369
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,796
her vagina work well
and she strong on plow.

370
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,091
But after three years, when she was 15,

371
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:10,721
then she become weak, her voice
become deep, "Borat, Borat."

372
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:14,725
She receive hair on chest

373
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,312
and her vagina hang like sleeve of wizard.

374
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,523
Huh. Jeez.

375
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:24,819
How do I know that
this will not happen with a car?

376
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,155
Chevrolet guarantees that with a warranty.

377
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,117
I like very much buy this Hummers.

378
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,744
- How much is it?
- 52,000.

379
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:40,751
I am looking for something between
$600 to $650.

380
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,838
We don't have any cars for 650
that you can buy.

381
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,048
I might be able to sell you
a wholesale car.

382
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,551
A car with a lot of miles for 700
with no warranty.

383
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,885
- Okay.
- Come on.

384
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,331

385
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,567

401
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:11,133

There was a parade.

409
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:43,874
I make two friends from this parade.

410
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,794
I invite them back my hotel room.

411
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,505

Then they say, "I wash you in a shower,"
and he wash me in a shower.

- What it mean, "Gay," this word?
- Homosexual.

417
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,856
A homosexual? You mean...

418
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:17,950

(horn honking)

421
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,960
Even though my anus was broken

422
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:32,089

would be great success.

423

You're singing at a rodeo tonight!

00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,624
Why didn't you mention it?

491
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,335

BOBBY ROWE
General Manager, Imperial Rodeo

501
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:40,045
from the terrorists or anything else,
the Muslims, they look like you,

502
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,339
- black hair and a black mustache.
- Yes.

503
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:46,635
Shave that dadgummed mustache off
so you're not so conspicuous.

504
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:49,972
So you look like maybe an Italian
or something

505
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,850
as far as when people looking at you.

506
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,394
I see a lot of people and I think,
"There's a dadgummed Muslim.

507
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:58,355
"I wonder what kind of bomb
he's got strapped to him."

508
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,816
- Yes.
- And you probably aren't a Muslim.

509
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,361
- Maybe that's not your religion.
- No, I am a Kazakh. I follow the hawk.

510
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,738
But you look like one of them.

511
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,199
This thing gets over with
and when we win it

512
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,118
and kick the butts over there

513
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,412
and all of them son-of-a-bucks
hanging from the gallows,

514
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:16,623
by that time, you will have proven yourself

515
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,542
and you'll be accepted.

516
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,793
- Take care.
- Thank you.

517
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,212
- I ain't gonna kiss you.
- Why not?

518
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,883
The people that do the kissing
are the ones that float around like that.

519
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:29,136
- Are they all...
- Yeah. Stay away from them that kiss.

520
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,971
- Okay.
- You don't want nobody kissing.

521
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:35,100
In my country they take them to jail
and finish them.

522
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,810
- Take them and hang them.
- Yes.

523
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,813
- That's what we're trying to get done.
- High five.

524
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,190
Ladies and gentlemen of Salem, Virginia,

525
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,985
would you please give a warm,
American welcome

526
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,906
to a gentleman who has come
all the way from Kazakhstan

527
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,701
and we are honored
to have singing our national anthem.

528
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:56,163
Ladies and gentlemen, Borat Sagdiyev.

529
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,134
My name Borat. I come from Kazakhstan.

530
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:14,598
Can I say first,
we support your war of terror.

531
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:18,162
( cheering and applause)

532
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:22,272
May we show our support
to our boys in Iraq.

533
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:29,029
May U.S. and A.
kill every single terrorist.

534
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,662
May your George Bush drink the blood

535
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:40,540
of every single man, woman
and child of Iraq.

536
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,000
Yeah!

537
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:48,090
May you destroy their country
so that for the next thousand years

538
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:52,177
not even a single lizard
will survive in their desert.

539
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,540
(light cheering)

540
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,514
To show our friendship,

541
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:59,351
I now will sing
our Kazakh national anthem

542
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:02,145
to the tune of your national anthem.

543
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,564
Please stand.

544
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:06,011
(singing)

545
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,736
Kazakhstan is the greatest

546
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,990
Country in the world

547
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:16,034
All other countries

548
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:19,788
Are run by little girls

549
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,833
Kazakhstan is number one

550
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:26,420
Exporter of potassium

551
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:30,048
Other Central Asian countries
( crowd murmuring)

552
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:33,510
Have inferior potassium

553
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,847
Kazakhstan is the greatest
( crowd booing)

554
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:39,558
Country in the world
(booing intensifies)

555
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,935
All other countries

556
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,563
Is the home of the gays

557
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:47,450
- (loud jeering)
- (horse whinnies)

558
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,797
( engine chugging)

559
00:33:56,534 --> 00:34:00,037
We nearly died last night.
This journey is cursed.

560
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,414
We should have stayed in New York.

561
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,082
l was sad.

562
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,835
The rodeo peoples did not like me.

563
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,588
What if Pamela did not like me too?

564
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:13,300
We needed something
to change our fortunes.

565
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,343
Look, Azamat, a Gypsy village.

566
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,931
Let us extract some of their tears
so we can remove the curse.

567
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:24,019
Do not fear me, Gypsy,
all I want from you is your tears.

568
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,938
Please give them to me or I will take them.

569
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:28,940
I'm not a Gypsy.

570
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:32,152
I'm a Midwestern
farmer's daughter. Americana.

571
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,988
You have many treasures.
Who did you rob for this?

572
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,532
We didn't rob them.
They came from the house.

573
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,202
I will look in your treasures, Gypsy.

574
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,955
Is this understood? I will look on them.

575
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,749
Please do.

576
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,463
Who is this lady you have shrunk?

577
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,424
Was she the owner of this house
that you camp in front of?

578
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,885
There's a couple more child's dolls.

579
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,555
Do not try and shrink me, Gypsy. I serious.

580
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,724
- These are your spells?
- No.

581
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,727
There's a good one,
The Millionaire Mindset.

582
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,480
There you go.

583
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,899
- Baywatch.
- Baywatch?

584
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,824
It means she love me.

585
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,162
Azamat!

586
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,832
Azamat, great success!
I've got the tears.

587
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,333
Onwards to California!

588
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,127
Let's go.

589
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,461
What's that you've got there?

590
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,630
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

591
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,168
(tires screeching)

592
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:42,830
(lively singing in foreign language)

593
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,521
Are we going the right way?

594
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,524
- I don't know, this map is from 1917.
- Where the hell are we?

595
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,322
Hey, stop that goddamn van!

596
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,577
Hey, baby, want to go out?
Wanna go out, honey?

597
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:07,229
- (spitting)
- (groaning)

598
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:07,894
(Borat speaking)

599
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,333
I'm going to stop and ask.

600
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,420
No, no, no, keep going. Keep going.

601
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,717
I need the direction to California, please.

602
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,635
- To California?
- You a long way from home.

603
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,263
Who you with, man?
Who you with, who you with?

604
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:27,851
I travel with my friend, Azamat Bagatov.
We travel across the country.

605
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:31,730
You can't be talking all that.
You gotta be talking English right here.

606
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:34,983
You look like Michael Jackson, Beat lt.

607
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,943
Man, you better...

608
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:42,908
I like you peoples.
Can you teach me how to dress?

609
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,784
How can I be like you?

610
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,037
You need to let them jeans down.

611
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,371
Pull them down?

612
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,207
Don't pull them down like...

613
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,250
- Like a ho?
- No, no, no.

614
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,211
- Like a this?
- Yeah.

615
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,671
But don't show your Huggies though, man.

616
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,174
What the hell? Is that fishnet?

617
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:02,135
No, no, no, these are my antipants.

618
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,680
- What kind of music you listen to?
- I like very much Corky Bucek.

619
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,307
You know Corky Bucek?

620
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,393
(singing gibberish, clicking tongue)
No, no, no.

621
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,231
You got to lick it before you stick it.

622
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,400
Can you teach me speak like you?

623
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,693
What you trying to say?

624
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:22,113
- How you say, "How do you do?"
- What's up with it?

625
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,990
- What's that with it?
- Yeah.

626
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,827
Pull over and let's see
if we can stay here.

627
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,421
What's up with it, vanilla-face?

628
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,591
Me and my homey, Azamat,
just parked our slab outside.

629
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:42,759
Please.

630
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:46,596
We are looking for somewhere to
post up our black asses for the night.

631
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,432
So bang-bang, skeet-skeet, nigga.

632
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,310
We just a couple of pimps, no ho's.

633
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,688
- Sir, you gotta leave.
- Okay.

634
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:58,108
Leave now or we're gonna call the cops
and we'll have you taken out.

635
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:02,570
We can't stay here,
they are player haters.

636
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,644
(engine chugging)

637
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,081
- Hi. Hello.
- You have a room for tonight?

638
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,166
Oh, yes. Yes, definitely.

639
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,377
- Come on in.
- Great.

640
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,796
Your friend also.

641
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,792
(door locks)

642
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,342
A beautiful house, this.

643
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,512
All the paintings in the house, I did.

644
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:28,847
What is this man?

645
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:33,852
This is a Yemenite Jew
and he's working on a piece of jewelry.

646
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:39,065
They, Yemenites, were also jewelers.

647
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,526
Why you have a picture of a Jew?

648
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:46,906
Because I'm Jewish,
so I have lots of pictures of Jews.

649
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:49,752
(eerie music plays)

650
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,623
This is the room and...

651
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:01,171
- Do you need two pillows?
- Yes.

652
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,590
Great. Thank you. Lovely place.

653
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,095
- They're Jews.
- I know that now.

654
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,181
They'll kill us.
We need to escape.

655
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,355
Shh!
(whispers)

656
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,016
(knocking)

657
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,864
- Wait, wait.
- Okay.

658
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,117
Hello.

659
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,245
- How are you?
- Great.

660
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,955
You guys getting settled in?

661
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,708
This is a special sandwich for you.

662
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:43,421
I not so hungry. He can eat this.

663
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,714
He fat.

664
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,966
No, no.

665
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,052
- You gonna eat, because...
- Take a half.

666
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,846
- Take a half and then you'll see.
- Take a half.

667
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,515
Yeah. I not so hungry.

668
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,392
You eat a little bit.

669
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:03,233
Go ahead and eat something
because you're hungry.

670
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,401
Yes.

671
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,437
(suspenseful music plays)

672
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,703
I don't want to see you go hungry.

673
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,331
What is this picture over here?

674
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,999
Okay... (spits)

675
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,426
(whispering):
It is 3:00 in the morning.

676
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,387
I am in a nest of Jews.

677
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:35,014
They have cleverly shifted their shapes.

678
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:39,185
One of them has taken the form
of a little old woman.

679
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,188
You can barely see her horns.

680
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,151
She have tried to poison me already.

681
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,945
These rats are very clever.

682
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,213
(toilet flushing)

683
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:58,121
Look, the Jews have
shifted their shapes.

684
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,000
OK, OK. How much shall
I give them?

685
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,794
I don't know...

686
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,047
More. Give them more.

687
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,127
(suspenseful music plays)

688
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,719
Go. Go.

689
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,471
(Borat speaking foreign language)

690
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,510
(shouting in foreign language)

691
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,713
(shouting continues)

692
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,579
(tires squealing)

693
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,320
Let's go back to New York,
at least there's no Jews there.

694
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,155
Calm down.
We'll keep heading to California.

695
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,115
Why California?
What's so special about California?

696
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,492
We are going to California!

697
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:36,910
And get killed on the way?

698
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:41,664
Relax, Azamat!
I will get us protection.

699
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,253
What is the best gun
to defend from a Jew?

700
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:54,427
I would recommend
either a 9 millimeter or a .45.

701
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,932
Very nice.

702
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:05,230
It like I movie star, Dirty Harold.

703
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:08,066
- Yes, sir.
- Come on and make my day, Jew.

704
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:14,030
But he would not sell me gun
since I not American.

705
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:16,449
So I look for other protection.

706
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,661
MUNCH RANCH
Exotic Animal Dealer

707
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:23,581
- What type of dog is this?
- This is a tortoise.

708
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,292
Is this a cat in a hat?

709
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,670
No, it's a tortoise in a shell.

710
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,505
Yes.

711
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,966
I need animal for protection.

712
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,260
What you have for me?

713
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:43,082
(growling)

714
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,792
(tires screeching)

715
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,457

717
00:42:57,107 --> 00:43:00,008
(speaking foreign language)

718
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:03,329
(Borat speaking)
We're safe.
Now we continue to California.

719
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:05,540
High five!

720
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,333
Great! Nice.

721
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:08,947
(kissing)

722
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:10,577
(laughing)

723
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,864
(ice cream truck music playing)

724
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:22,063
(Azamat shouting)

725
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,850
Switch it off.

726
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,268
It so annoying!

727
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:45,079
Happy times. We were safe
and well on our way to Pamela.

728
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,707
It was time to get back to work.

729
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:54,756
Kazakhstan needs to learn
about American fine dining.

730
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,967
First, a lady will
teach you southern manners.

731
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,469
How long have I got?

732
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:03,556
An hour. Then you have
dinner date with high society.

733
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,852
Hello and nice meet you.

734
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,521

KATHIE B. MARTIN

00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,572
Of course, I'll be happy to.

738
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,827
Is it polite to greet people

739
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:25,995
THE MAGNOLIA MANSION
Dining Society

740
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,413

741
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,917
- Let me introduce you around.
- Yes.

742
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,295
- You're gonna have to...
- I'm Mike. Mike Jared.

743
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,924
Hello, I'm Bethany Weston.

- Nice.

745
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,178
- How you do?
- How do you do? My name's Ben.

746
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:50,603
Should I pay interest in peoples
around the table-sides?

747
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,146
Yes.

748
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:55,692
And, if it is a big table,
a very long table,

749
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,027
you might want to restrict
your conversation...

750
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:01,364
- Yes.
- ...to people right in your vicinity.

751
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,991
- Very nice.
- So you are not yelling.

752
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:07,634
(laughing)

753
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,997
What do you do?

754
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,875
- I'm the pastor of a church.
- Yes.

755
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,713
- What do you do?
- I have spent years in construction.

756
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:20,133
I'm recently retired.

757
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,677
- You are retard?
- Yes.

758
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,929
Physical or mental?

759
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:29,392
- Retired.
- No, no, not retarded.

760
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,978
- I don't work anymore.
- Stopped working.

761
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:35,982
It's very good you allow retard

762
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:39,902
to eat with you in the same place.

763
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:43,156
That's not what
we're saying about this man.

764
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,577
He is not what
you would refer to as retard.

765
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,080
- No.
- No, no. Not at all.

766
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,791
Do you have a telephone in this village?

767
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,501
Of course.

768
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,927
Should I show photos of my family?

769
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,847
You have photos
of your family? Wonderful.

770
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:11,684
This my favorite son, Huey Lewis.

771
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,270
- Okay.
- Yes.

772
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,230
- He looks happy.
- Yes.

773
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,817
He very strong.

774
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:23,780
- My goodness, is that him holding you?
- Yes. Very strong.

775
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:28,534
He grow three centimeter.
He now 17 centimeter long.

776
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:35,416
I'm not sure I would show
these photos of him without clothes on.

777
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:39,420
Should I pay compliments to the peoples?

778
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:44,383
Yes, but only if you truly agree
with that compliment.

779
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:48,513
You have a very gentle face

780
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:52,767
- and a very erotic physique.
- Thank you.

781
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,727
- You're correct.
- Yes.

782
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,729
That's a very good observation.

783
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,815
She is your wife?

784
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,691
Nope. That's my wife.

785
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:06,697
In my country,(laughter)
they would go crazy for these two.

786
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,199
Not so much.

787
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:11,059
(guests murmuring)

788
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,084
What should I say if
I need to go to the shit hole?

789
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,878
You mean to the restroom?

790
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:24,507
- To the place to make the shit.
- The bathroom? Okay. What you...

791
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,425
Not to bath. To make dirt from anus.

792
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,387
- Not a bath, right. The toilet.
- The brown...

793
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:32,348
- Where you make... You understand?
- Yes. Yes.

794
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:34,642
- Bad? Bad thing from it.
- Yes.

795
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,186
Brown.

796
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:41,440
What you do is you say, "Excuse me,
I need to go to the restroom."

797
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:47,363
Excuse me, is it possible
to go and do a, you know...

798
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,949
- To be excused?
- How you say in the, you know...

799
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,869
Upstairs. Just say,
"Excuse me a moment."

800
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:56,664
- I need to go, what you say...
- That works. Thank you.

801
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:59,917
- Can you go upstairs?
- Yes, thank you.

802
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:05,089
I think that the cultural differences
are vast...

803
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,092
- Exactly.
- ...and I think he's a delightful man

804
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:14,307
and it wouldn't take very much time
for him to really become Americanized.

805
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,434
Thank you very much. I feel much better.

806
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,728
- Cindy, where shall I put this?
- Just...

807
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:20,897
Where should I put this?

808
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,278
Maybe in the other restroom down here.

809
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:28,613
In the...

810
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:33,159
Excuse me...
Excuse me for just a moment, please.

811
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:37,747
You roll off like this

812
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:41,459
and you wipe your bottom
and you put the paper... Look.

813
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,419
- You, wipe mine?
- No, I don't. You do.

814
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:47,590
- This is a very private thing.
- The host cleans the anus of the other?

815
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:51,928
No, no, no.
Nobody touches you, except you.

816
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,722
Can I bring a guest to dinner?

817
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:58,601
If you have been invited
to a home or to a party...

818
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:02,605
- Yes.
- ...it is acceptable to bring a guest

819
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,733
- if you ask your host in advance.
- Yes.

820
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:07,944
General Stonewall Jackson, Robert E. Lee.
(knocking)

821
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:12,782
- I think this my friend. Hello?
- Hi, I'm looking for Borat.

822
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,034
- Yes, it's me.
- Oh, hi, honey.

823
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,454
- I'm Luenell. Hi, hi.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

824
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,748
- This my friend, Luenell.
- Hi.

825
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,626
Oh, okay...

826
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,630
You all having a dinner party.

827
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:31,509
Well, we were. I don't know exactly
what all that we're doing...

828
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:35,596
- It is getting very, very late.
- Excuse me, I'm going to have to go.

829
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:38,391
- Okay. Very nice.
- It's getting very, very late

830
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:41,644
and it's time that, you know,

831
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:45,314
we were ending
our dinner party and everything.

832
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:48,317
- I apologize...
- But can't she come for desserts?

833
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,903
Absolutely not, and neither can you.

834
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,239
- The sheriff is on his way.
- I hope so.

835
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,074
I've already called them.

836
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:58,202
Why you call police?
Have the retard escaped?

837
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:05,209
I want say I very sorry
how they treat you in this house.

838
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,836
Thank you.

839
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,589
I was thinking
maybe I'd just take the night off.

840
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,842
Why don't we just go out
and have some fun?

841
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:15,136
What do you think about that?

842
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,388
You want to come with us?

843
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:18,723
Up yours!

844
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:21,377
- (country music playing)
- (shouting, whooping)

845
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:23,749
(man singing country)

846
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,736
Hi! My name Borat.

847
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,280
- This my friend, Luenell.
- Hi, Luenell.

848
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,365
She is a prostitute.

849
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,596
(cheering)

850
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,034
Oh!

851
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:45,873
(laughter)

852
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:49,036
(grunting)

853
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:52,240
(laughter)

854
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,844
You were funny on that bull.

855
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:59,889
Everybody almost see your underpants.

856
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:02,099
I never rode a bull before.

857
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:10,066
Well, you wanna...
You wanna come in for a little while?

858
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,235
I would like very much

859
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,405
but I in love with a woman in Malibu.

860
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,116
It would not be nice to her for me to...

861
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:23,829
Okay, well, if you're ever in town again,
this way, you know, look me up.

862
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,208
If I ever in town again, Luenell,

863
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:29,960
I would very much like to pay you for sex.

864
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,170
(laughing)
Okay.

865
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:32,152
( chuckles)

866
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,215
Good night, Luenells.

867
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:35,966
Good night, Borat.

868
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:38,694
(both chuckle)

869
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:47,186
You say my name right. Borat.

870
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,980
People say Borak or Billy or Bob.

871
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,733
Bye.

872
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:09,667
"Pamela is a fairly simple girl,
she recently explained.

873
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:14,797
"'There's not a whole lot of logic
in the way I live my life.

874
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:16,882
"'I am very spontaneous."'

875
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,677
I'm very spontaneous too.

876
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,449
I needed a gift to give to Pamela

877
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:45,911
so that she would grant me
entry into her vagina.

878
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:51,876
Therefore, I convinced Azamat to let me
film a report in an American store.

879
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:56,922
Don't spend more than $3.
We're low on money.

880
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,676
This your shops?

881
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,803
Right, this is my antique shop.

882
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:05,931
Why do you have
so many things with a flag?

883
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,142
We're honoring our heritage.

884
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:12,188
Now, what in here? What is this?

885
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,148
These are a number of collectibles.

886
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:17,902
I mean, this is a lamp that, you know,
you would use in your home.

887
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:21,572
This is a Chinese cloisonn bell.

888
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:25,576
And this is a little decorative duck.

889
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:28,746
And do you think, you know, when they...

890
00:53:28,749 --> 00:53:30,673
(vase crashing)

891
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:34,793
I'm sorry. Wait, wait, wait.

892
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,884
- We need help, baby.
- No, it's okay.

893
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,472
I sorry.

894
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:53,479
Sorry. I will repair all of this.

895
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:58,734
Don't worry.
My friend, he can make glue and...

896
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:02,238
I don't think you're gonna be able to glue
it. You're gonna have to pay for it.

897
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:05,241
Okay, I have a digital watch
from the future.

898
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:08,202
I will give you.
Is worth more than all of this.

899
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:10,913
You broke $425 worth of stuff.

900
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:14,875
160, 170, 180.

901
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,879
- That's not enough.
- Do you want hair...

902
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,756
No, I don't want any damn hair.

903
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,133
This is best hair in Kazakhstan.
Feel the quality.

904
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,760
I don't want your damn hair.

905
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:28,430
This is hair from pubis.
I can get 2,000 bags by next Friday.

906
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,100
We don't use that stuff in this country.

907
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,977
Have you offered them pubic hair?

908
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,770
Yes!

909
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,855
Just give me another 20.

910
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,274
It was a mistake.

911
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,566
You screwed up again.

912
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:40,901
I didn't see the truck.

913
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,112
- I slipped on it and that was it.
- Only an idiot could do this.

914
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:47,449
Would you have believed this
if I had told you? All right. Go. Go. Go.

915
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,551
(Azamat shouting)

916
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,536
(shouting continues)

917
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:55,541
You've ruined this documentary
and almost bankrupt us.

918
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,127
So call the ministry
and get more money.

919
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:01,297
What? If I did that,
they would kill us!

920
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:06,343
California had better be as good
as you say, or we're finished.

921
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,657
You bastard.

922
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,160
What's the matter with you?

923
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:34,413
How dare you make
hand-party over Pamela.

924
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:37,041
Why do you care who I
pleasure myself to?

925
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:39,043
Because I love this woman.

926
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:42,296
She's the reason
we travel to California!

927
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,214
What?
You lied to me!

928
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,175
You lied about California!

929
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,984
Eat my asshole!

930
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:20,060
Holy...

931
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,354
Okay.

932
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:27,874
( elevator bell dings)

933
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:42,418
(bell dings)

934
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:44,152
(shouting in foreign language)

935
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:47,354
(crowd clamoring)

936
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,673
We have a special guest here this evening.
Ruth Feiner is here.

937
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:51,258
MORTGAGE BROKERS
ANNUAL BANQUET

938
00:57:51,264 --> 00:57:54,465
- (shouting in foreign language)
- (crowd gasping)

939
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,640
(both screaming)

940
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:01,539
( crowd clamoring)

941
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:11,347
- (both shouting)
- What are you doing? Come on. Cut it out!

942
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:16,516
(all shouting)

943
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:19,328
Get the fuck out of here!

944
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:21,056
(Borat shouts)

945
00:58:24,998 --> 00:58:26,898
(birds chirping)

946
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,418
(woman vocalizing in ethereal voice)

947
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:32,049
So bad news.

948
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:35,594
Azamat have leave.

949
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:39,598
I wake up, he disappear

950
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:44,436
and he take Oxana, my bear.

951
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:46,271
Our bear.

952
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:50,108
And he also decide to take all money

953
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,444
and also my passport.

954
00:58:56,241 --> 00:59:01,370
And he leave me

955
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:05,290
only this bag, with a hen

956
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:14,299
and ticket to Kazakhstan.

957
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,135
But no passport.

958
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:23,016
But at least he is

959
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:25,644
man enough to leave me

960
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:33,777
my beautiful.

961
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:39,825
Which I have cleaned since last night.

962
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:47,457
And I have decide to

963
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,835
continue making documentary.

964
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,589
Make it without Azamat.

965
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,424
I think it will be better

966
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:58,969
and we will have more success
without him.

967
01:00:00,793 --> 01:00:02,693
Chenquieh.

968
01:00:04,998 --> 01:00:08,229
- ( clucking)
- (speaks foreign language)

969
01:00:27,153 --> 01:00:30,486
(ethereal chanting)

970
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:38,175
I only want 17 cents, please.

971
01:00:44,003 --> 01:00:46,301
( engine sputtering)

972
01:00:46,406 --> 01:00:48,067
(horn honking)

973
01:00:48,174 --> 01:00:50,005
(tires screeching)

974
01:00:50,109 --> 01:00:52,703
( engine sputtering)

975
01:00:52,812 --> 01:00:54,473
( engine stops)

976
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:07,496
I had no car, no money and no Azamat.

977
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,539
The only thing keep me going

978
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:13,585
was my dream of one day
holding Pamela in my arms

979
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,963
and then making romance explosion
on her stomach.

980
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:29,309
Eventually, I managed to hike a hitchings
with group of young scholars

981
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:31,645
also traveling across country.

982
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,690
FRATERNITY BROTHERS
Univ. of S. Carolina

983
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:38,026
- How you doing? How you doing?
- Where the fuck are you from, baby?

984
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,611
I am from Kazakhstan.

985
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,656
- Welcome to fucking America!
- Hey, have a seat. Let's go.

986
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,367
- What's your name?
- Anthony.

987
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:46,868
- Anthony?
- Yes.

988
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,704
- Anthony.
- And Justin.

989
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,707
- Justin.
- And David.

990
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,166
- David.
- Bartender Dave.

991
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:54,710
Very nice.

992
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:57,379
- Can you open this, please?
- Oh, sure.

993
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,675
Thank you very much.

994
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:05,887
So you like the bitches out there
in the fucking old Russia, there?

995
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,723
- What?
- The bitches in old Russia.

996
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,474
How are the women?

997
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,686
The fucking ho's, baby! The fucking girls!

998
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,563
- You fuck the shit out of them!
- Yes!

999
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:16,022
Then you never call them again.

1000
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:19,818
Why you don't call them? Because
they do not have a telephone, yes?

1001
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:21,361
No, not because of that.

1002
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:24,030
They don't have my respect, you know?
I mean...

1003
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:26,783
So, what are you doing here in America?

1004
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:31,621
They film me travel across U.S. and A.

1005
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:35,208
I don't know what you're saying, man,
but that's cool!

1006
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:36,918
Let's get drunk!

1007
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:39,296
- Yes! High five!
- High five!

1008
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:45,719
This is America in a bottle.

1009
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:51,016
- Oh, baby!
- Oh, baby!

1010
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,935
- Borat, let me hear it. Oh, baby!
- Oh, the baby!

1011
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,021
Suck, suck, suck!

1012
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,612
Let me tell you game we play.

1013
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:05,280
Can I hear a game you play?

1014
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:09,075
We play a game called
"When the snake eat the pig."

1015
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,162
- When the snake eat the huh?
- The snake eat the pig.

1016
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:15,540
- You get a baby mouse, very small...
- Baby mouse?

1017
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:22,255
...and you put a bit of cheese
in hole of your chram, until it go inside.

1018
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,757
That is too crazy for me.

1019
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:26,593
I'll do it.
I don't give a fuck, I'll do it.

1020
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:28,887
Let me ask you this.

1021
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:33,183
Are woman...
Are women your slaves in Russia?

1022
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,894
No. Do you have slaves here?

1023
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:37,729
- We wish. We wish.
- No slaves.

1024
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,023
- It is a shame.
- Hey, Borat.

1025
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,191
Big shame. Big shame.

1026
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:42,776
It would be better country if...

1027
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:45,695
Yes, it'd be better country.
We should have slaves.

1028
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:49,032
Our country, the minorities
actually have more power.

1029
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:53,703
Anyone that is minority
has the upper hand.

1030
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:58,041
We have the Jews. We have anybody
that's against the mainstream.

1031
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:01,002
- Do you want to see my new wife?
- Yes!

1032
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,796
This my new wife.

01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,592
Pamela! I know of Pamela.

1035
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,136
I will take her virgin for the first time.

1036
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:12,973
- I am going to put this shit on.
- Put it on.

1037
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:15,225
Borat, Borat. We have a lot to talk about.

1038
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:17,435
I will take her virgin. I will uncork her.

1039
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,647
Borat, Borat. She is no virgin, Borat.

1040
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:22,732
- Is not true.
- She is no virgin, buddy.

1041
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:26,152
Is not true. Liar!
Liar, liar, your panties on fire.

1042
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:27,779
Borat, shut up.

Small Jacuzzi on a fucking small yacht.

1044
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:33,451
What she do?

1045
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:37,038
- She's sucking some dick, man.
- You see her sucking dick?

1046
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:38,415
This is not her.

1047
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:42,544
I guarantee you that shit's gonna happen.
Don't worry about it.

1048
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:45,589
- That's her, Borat. Sorry.
- Borat, that's her.

1049
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,173
This is not her.

1050
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:48,884
It's her. I'm sorry.

1051
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:51,219
- I'm sure it's her.
- I go.

1052
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,221
- No, no, no.
- Titty bar.

1053

1054
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,933
You're my man. You're my man.

1055
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:59,686
I do not know why she is trying to do this.

1056
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,605
Come on, Borat. Stay with us, buddy.

1057
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:05,275
We love you. We'll remember you always.

Go.

1075
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:41,496
Run to freedom.

1076
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:45,125
Go! Go and live your life!

1077
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:51,360

(music stops)

1084
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:37,761
Come on!

1085
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:42,057

1089

JIM SMITH
Chief Justice, State Supreme Court

1091
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:54,903
we were one in the beginning

1092
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:59,449
and we gonna always be a Christian
nation until the good Lord returns. Amen.

1093
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:04,454
I didn't evolve out of a monkey.

1094
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:07,749
I didn't use to be a tadpole.
I is what I is.

1095
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:09,417
Praise you, Jesus.

1096
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:13,588
The Bible says that God
was manifest in the flesh

1097
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:15,715
and believed on in the world.

1098
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,844

(speaking in tongues)

1101
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:30,146
I don't care what the devil's done to you
or what he's trying to do.

1102
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:32,816
All you gotta do
is step out of that aisle now

1103
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,943
and make your way down to this altar.

1104
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:37,362
Let's have a little
old-time church right now.

1105
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:40,573
I need somebody to
pray with me right now. Come on, sir!

1106
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:44,452
The blood over my neighbor.
I bleed the blood over my church.

1107
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:50,208
I want you to help me, save me, please.

1108
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,585
Ladies and gentlemen, the gentleman here,

1109
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:55,130
standing right next to me,
his name is Bolak.

1110
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:59,551
Would you greet him with a great big
Jesus name for just a couple of minutes?

1111
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:01,010
Thank you.

1112
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,180
I have no friends.

1113
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:06,307
I am alone in this country.

1114
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:07,934
Nobody like me.

1115
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:10,103
My only friend, Azamat,

1116
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:14,023
he take my money and my bear
and he leave me alone.

1117
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:15,567
Not only this.

1118
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:19,863
The woman I love,
the reason I travel across the country,

1119
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:23,491

1120
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:26,536
- and now I can never forgive her.
- You have to.

1121
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:29,789
Is there anybody who can help me?

1122
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:33,126
Yes. The one that can help you
is who we preached about tonight.

1123
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:35,962
- Jesus.
- Do Jesus like me?

1124
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:38,631
Absolutely, Jesus loves you.

1125
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:42,177
Do Jesus like my sons?

1126
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:43,553
Jesus loves your sons.

1127
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:46,472
Do Jesus love my retard brother, Bilo?

1128
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:48,016
He loves your brother, Bilo.

1129
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:52,270

1130
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:53,855
Yes. He loves everybody.

1131
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:56,858
Nobody love my neighbor,
Nursultan Tulyakbay.

1132
01:09:56,889 --> 01:09:58,450
(laughter)

1133
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:01,779
Can Jesus heal the pain
that is in my heart?

1134
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:05,033
Jesus can heal your pain in your heart.

1135
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:08,119
Make him heal the pain that is in my heart.

1136
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:11,164
- Lift your hands and begin to worship.
- Lift your hands.

1137
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:15,001
Would you lift your hands with him
as we pray in the name of Jesus.

1138
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:16,878
- God, forgive me of my sins.
- God, forgive me...

1139
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:19,422
- Forgive me, God. Cleanse me.
- Cleanse me.

1140
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:21,883
Cleanse me, Lord, in the name of Jesus.

1141
01:10:21,947 --> 01:10:23,800
- (speaking in tongues)
- (imitating preacher)

1142
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:25,929
Yeah, let that tongue go. Here it comes.

1143
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:28,556
(speaking in tongues)
We're gonna speak in other tongues.

1144
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:30,475
Let that tongue go.

1145
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,811
Yes, God. Yes, God. Yes, God.

1146
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,652
Yes! Yes!

1147
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:03,299
I will forgive Pamela
and I will go to California.

1148
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:06,261
I will go to Malibu with me
and my friend, Mr. Jesus

1149
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:08,179
and together we will take her!

1150
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:19,148
I took a bus to Los Angeles
with some friends of Mr. Jesus.

1151
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:21,693
Finally, I had arrived.

1152
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,779
Happy times.

1153
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:29,140
(singing hymn)

1154
01:11:29,248 --> 01:11:32,183
(singing continues)

1155
01:11:35,387 --> 01:11:37,821
- (singing continues)
- (growls lightly)

1156
01:11:37,923 --> 01:11:39,356
(singing halfheartedly)

1157
01:11:42,995 --> 01:11:45,987
(singing continues)

1158
01:11:46,098 --> 01:11:48,006
(singing ends)

1159
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,220
Marilyn.

1160
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:51,222
Azamat?

1161
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:53,308
You traitor!

1162
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:54,559
Look, I can explain.

1163
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:57,645
You attack me.
My mustache still taste of your testes!

1164
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:58,980
Calm down.
Let me explain.

1165
01:11:59,064 --> 01:12:00,690
What did you do with the bear?

1166
01:12:00,774 --> 01:12:03,401
She ran off. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1167
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:05,903
Hey! Fuck off, Death!

1168
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:07,655
You need to calm yourself!

1169
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,407
You have to calm down!

1170
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:16,706
Well, that's another fine
mess you've gotten me into.

1171
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:23,838
I had not come to Hollywood
to fight a man dressed as Hitler.

1172
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:28,259
l had come to make
Pamela Andersons my wife.

1173
01:12:29,261 --> 01:12:31,054
So I forgave Azamat.

1174
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:35,099
I knew you'd make it here, Borat.

1175
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:38,853
I felt so bad that I prepare this for you.

1176
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:44,942
It's everything I could find on Pamela.

1177
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:51,783
Last Friday she appeared for a group
who are against cruelty to animals.

1178
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:54,118
Against cruelty to animals?

1179
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,379
And tomorrow she's doing a signing.

1180
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,798
She wrote a book.

1181
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,595
What? A woman has written a book?

1182
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:15,598
Dr. Yamak would never believe this.

1183
01:13:15,682 --> 01:13:16,724
I know.

1184
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:21,938
We will go to this historical event,

1185
01:13:22,022 --> 01:13:23,815
and I will marry Pamela there...

1186
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:27,235
...but in the traditional Kazakhi way.

1187
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:30,822
Azamat, let's prepare the
wedding sack.

1188
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:34,283
You forgive me, yes?

1189
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:36,953
Yes.

1190
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:52,844
Having learned many lessons
from U.S. and A,

1191
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:56,889
I will now teach America
how to have a wedding Kazakhi-style.

1192
01:13:57,891 --> 01:13:59,851
You find more.

1193
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:10,528

l was humiliated.

1244
01:16:53,191 --> 01:16:55,943
It was time for me to return to New York,

1245
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:59,530
where a ticket was waiting for me
to fly back home.

1246
01:17:00,365 --> 01:17:05,536
While I sat on the bus, I thought of
my journey over the past three weeks.

1247
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:08,122
The great times.

1248
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:10,541

01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,002

l had come to America
to learn lessons for Kazakhstan

01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:22,386
but what had I learned?

1253
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:26,724
Suddenly, I realized.

1254
01:17:30,228 --> 01:17:33,731
I had learned that if you chase a dream,

1255
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:36,901
especially one with plastic chests,

1256
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:40,780
you can miss the real beauty
in front of your eyes.
