1
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,847
Okay. All right, one, two, three...

2
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,441
Guys! One...

3
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,330
Hold on. Guys, freeze!

4
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,444
- Where's Alvin?
- Hey, Dave.

5
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,690
- Where have you been?
- Where have I been?

6
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,285
Trying to board the ship.

7
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,250
Already done that.
Also, checked out our room,

8
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,924
dibbed the side of the bed
closest to the window,

9
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,520
ordered us a round of virgin piña coladas

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,367
and signed us up for parasailing.

11
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,283
Alvin, you're too young for parasailing.

12
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,806
I thought we were going on vacation
to have fun.

13
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,645
Don't worry,
family vacations are all about fun.

14
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,281
But first we're gonna need
to set some rules.

15
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,204
Let's start with you can't call dibs
on a bed until everyone's in the room.

16
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,281
- Good rule.
- That's right.

17
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,210
That's a good one, Simon.
All right, so that's our first rule.

18
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,606
Should we go over the rest of them?

19
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,924
Dave, come on. "Rules" is my middle name.

20
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,771
- Hey, Dave.
- Alvin!

21
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,769
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

22
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,846
<i>All kids are now allowed to play</i>
<i>on the adults-only Serenity Deck.</i>

23
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,287
Alvin!

24
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,448
<i>Alvin!</i>

25
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,651
- We talked about setting rules, Alvin.
- I'm sorry.

26
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,564
I didn't know the agreement meant no fun.

27
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,444
You're allowed to have fun.

28
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,124
When are you going to stop
acting like a child?

29
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,124
When are you going to stop
treating me like a child?

30
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,771
I'll stop treating you like a child
when you start acting like a grown-up!

31
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,123
I'll start acting like a grown-up
when you start...

32
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,449
Hey, girls, not now, please, okay?

33
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,891
- Lame!
- Sorry, Dave.

34
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,889
I need to get ready
for dinner with the captain.

35
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,121
We're having dinner with the captain?

36
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,441
No, I am. You're staying here.

37
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,564
I have to go apologize
for everything Alvin did.

38
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,289
This is so not fair. Not to us, not to Dave,

39
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,970
and certainly not to the captain,

40
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,163
who I'm sure was really looking forward
to dining with me.

41
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,201
Why don't I go speak with Dave?
See if I can smooth things over.

42
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,326
Knock-knock.

43
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,407
- What is it, Simon?
- Well, I would never say this to Alvin.

44
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,211
Goodness knows
he can be totally irresponsible,

45
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,487
but I actually have a suggestion.

46
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,931
You have a suggestion for me?

47
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,806
He's been driving me crazy a lot longer
than he's been driving you crazy.

48
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,649
All right. So what is it?

49
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,809
Imagine Alvin is a spirited racehorse.

50
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,251
That's your advice?

51
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,123
No. I'm not done yet, Dave.

52
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,009
All right, so Alvin is a racehorse...

53
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,482
And you, Dave,
are his incredibly helpful jockey

54
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,325
who's there to guide him
down the racetrack of life.

55
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,209
But if you hold the reins too tight,

56
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,851
that racehorse is going to fight and buck,

57
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,042
which is no fun for anyone.

58
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,963
But if you loosen the reins just a little...

59
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,121
He'II fly right off the track
and crash into the fence.

60
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,126
I know you want to protect Alvin,

61
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,329
but, Dave, sometimes kids
will rise to the occasion

62
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,289
if you just show them a little trust.

63
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,045
All right, guys, room service is on its way.
Lights out by 9:00.

64
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,770
Dave, question.

65
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,806
If we're going to be held captive
in this room...

66
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,285
Because of Alvin!

67
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,646
Can we at least watch a movie?

68
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,164
All right, let's see what's on.

69
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,850
You know what,
why don't you guys pick a movie?

70
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,530
You're old enough
to make your own decision.

71
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,761
For real, Dave?

72
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,961
Absolutely.

73
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,010
- Dave looks so elegant.
- Have fun!

74
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,449
Wait, Dave, before you go,
I made something for you.

75
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,245
Wow, it's really...

76
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,089
It's soft so you can sleep in it

77
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,801
and I made it with all the colors,
so it will go with everything!

78
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,409
Great. I'll put it on after dinner.

79
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,121
You could put it on now, so everyone
at the captain's table could see it.

80
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,727
Nice.

81
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,643
A real chick magnet.

82
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,521
All right, guys, have fun.

83
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,730
But not too much fun,
because I'm still very upset.

84
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,682
Goodbye, Dave.

85
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,883
And, hello, ladies!

86
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,365
I like my tail shaken, not stirred.

87
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,529
- Where are you going?
- To the casino. I'm feeling lucky.

88
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,921
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Dave said...

89
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,281
Dave said, and I quote,

90
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,961
"We're old enough
to make our own decisions."

91
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,889
He meant we were old enough
to choose a film!

92
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,766
Well, we're clearly not.
Check out what Theodore just picked.

93
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,885
What's wrong with this movie?

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,843
It's for babies!

95
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,409
Which is probably why
Dave treats us like babies.

96
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,528
Munk up, Theodore.

97
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,282
There. That's more like it.

98
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,204
Alvin, please!

99
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,681
I say we go to Salsa Night!

100
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,171
In our pajamas?

101
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,084
I know!

102
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,291
Alvin!

103
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,163
Alvin! Alvin!

104
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,167
And we have a winner.

105
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,642
Ellie, I love these dresses!

106
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,250
You're so crafty.

107
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,721
Thanks. It's what I do.

108
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,448
- Sorry!
- What are you?

109
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,811
- We are the Chipettes.
- Hi, I'm Eleanor!

110
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,611
My sister was just trying to apologize.

111
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,160
What's she sorry for?
Stepping on my friend's foot?

112
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,767
Or her busted, tired little dance moves?

113
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,245
No, you didn't!

114
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,885
Yes, she did!

115
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,760
You better get those Lee Press-Ons
out of my face

116
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,683
unless you want to meet my claws.

117
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,811
And, yeah, baby, they're real.

118
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,682
- Do you wanna go?
- Hit it!

119
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,248
Captain, I'm really sorry
about what happened.

120
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,130
Alvin, he's a kid.
He's just trying to have some fun.

121
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,565
There's nothing wrong with fun.

122
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,689
Our pelican makes sure
that everybody on the ship has fun.

123
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,889
In fact, in port,
he circles the ship on a hang glider.

124
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,121
It's really quite amusing.

125
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,044
However, my number one priority
is the passengers' safety.

126
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,920
So I simply cannot have Alvin put
himself, or anyone else, at risk again.

127
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,729
Believe me, I understand.

128
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,407
If Alvin breaks any more of our rules,
there will be consequences.

129
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,289
The last thing we want
is anyone getting hurt.

130
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,010
Excuse me.

131
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,611
- Hot!
- Sorry.

132
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,806
Hot!

133
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,524
Unbelievable. Gravy pants.

134
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,283
Hey, hey!

135
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,050
- Do you have a problem with me?
- You bet I have a problem with you.

136
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,929
- Why?
- As if you didn't know.

137
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,326
I don't know.

138
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,327
Ian? What are you doing here?

139
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,004
I'm working, Dave.

140
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,567
This is your job?

141
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,765
Yeah, not too many record labels
are interested in hiring the guy

142
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,571
who blew it with the Chipmunks,
blew it with the Chipettes

143
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,120
and passed on Justin Bieber.

144
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,321
Twice.

145
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,566
Look, Ian, I'm sorry you lost your job
and your dignity.

146
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,768
But spilling things, hot things, on me

147
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,644
isn't going to bring any of that stuff back.

148
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,762
You're right, Dave.
It's too late for me to get my old life back.

149
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,963
But it's not too late to ruin yours.

150
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,451
You want to ruin my life?

151
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,403
Why don't we just start with this vacation?

152
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,887
If I see those chipmunks
break so much as one rule,

153
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,201
I'm going straight to Captain Correlli.

154
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,891
You're in my house now!

155
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,123
Although, technically it's not a house,
it's a ship.

156
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,529
The point is, I'll be watching you.

157
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,484
Like a hawk!

158
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,647
- Theodore?
- Please don't eat my brain!

159
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,521
Why are you watching <i>Jungle Monster 4?</i>

160
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,523
Alvin, how could you...

161
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,523
Alvin?

162
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,329
Simon?

163
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,124
Girls?

164
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,887
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

165
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,609
I'll be right back!

166
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,603
It's dark.

167
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,809
You're up for an International Music Award.
That's fantastic!

168
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,843
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

169
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,003
I guess. If you like a lot of adulation.

170
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,571
We fly there right after the cruise.
Hoping to take home Record of the Year.

171
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,246
That would make you
the youngest winner ever.

172
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,731
I'm not that young.

173
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,648
I mean, I'm hanging out in a casino
way past my bedtime.

174
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,931
Not that I have a bedtime!

175
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,809
No one tells me what to do.

176
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,723
Alvin!

177
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,322
Who's Alan, I wonder?

178
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,406
Anyway.

179
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,166
I'd love to chat more, but I've gotta run.

180
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,243
You're in a lot of trouble, young man!

181
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,607
You can follow me on Critter!

182
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,487
Alvin! Alvin!

183
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,085
Simon?

184
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,242
I wasn't betting. Honest.

185
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,485
Your winnings, sir.

186
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,284
Oh, busted!

187
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,480
I didn't sneak out. I mean, I did.
But only to stop Alvin.

188
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,847
- Right.
- There they are, Captain.

189
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,365
Captain.

190
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,648
What's he going to do,
make us walk the plank?

191
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,281
There's a plank?

192
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,409
No, there's no plank,
but if you guys disobey me one more time,

193
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,720
you will be off the ship.

194
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,610
And you'II miss the International
Music Awards. Do you understand?

195
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,523
Yes, Dave.

196
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,687
Absolutely.

197
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,962
What if we need to disobey you?

198
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,246
And why would you need to do that?

199
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,523
Well, let's say that you tell me to stay put.

200
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,401
"Alvin, if you move from that chair,
you're grounded!"

201
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,211
But then I happen to see pirates

202
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,441
climbing up ropes, ever so stealthy,
from the side of the ship.

203
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,289
Now, it would be easy for me

204
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,007
to take my trusty old Swiss Army knife
and cut the ropes.

205
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,687
But I have to stay put. Or do I?

206
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,171
Yes, Alvin, you do.

207
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,884
And what are you doing
with a pocket knife?

208
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,962
What pocket knife are you referring to?

209
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,889
Come on, give it to me.
You could cut yourself.

210
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,287
So, I could have saved the whole ship
from robbage and pilgering

211
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,084
and you'd still ground me?

212
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,767
Alvin, there's no such word as robbage.
And it's "pillaging."

213
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,446
But he does have a point, Dave.

214
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,370
There's got to be times when you trust us
to take matters into our own hands.

215
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,484
I trusted you tonight
and look where that got me!

216
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,927
That's probably just the hot gravy talking.

217
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,329
You're all lucky Captain Correlli
has allowed you one more activity.

218
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,046
Is it hang gliding, wakeboarding,
or bungee jumping?

219
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,401
No. Shuffleboard.

220
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,686
Man!

221
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,485
By my calculations,

222
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,844
it appears to be 10% shuffle, 90% bored.

223
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,410
That's funny!

224
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,364
Thanks. You really think so?

225
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,966
You know, Dave, I think I'd prefer the plank.

226
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,089
Sorry, Alvin, but this is what you get to do.

227
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,688
And I get to do something
I haven't done in a long time.

228
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,726
Absolutely nothing.

229
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,244
Brittany approaches her puck,

230
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,446
adjusts her stance,
looks over at me, quite annoyed,

231
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,923
wonders to herself
if I'm ever going to shut my mouth,

232
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,522
realizes I'm not, and makes her move.

233
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,329
And...

234
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,767
It's short!

235
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,207
A costly error, ladies and gentlemen,

236
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,523
that's going to haunt her
the rest of her career.

237
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,242
You can make all the jokes you want, Alvin,

238
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,563
but not even you can make this interesting.

239
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,890
Really? Well,

240
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,089
care to make it interesting
that I can make this interesting?

241
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,410
Alvin, what are you up to?
Need I remind you Dave is watching us.

242
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,643
Simon, the poor guy hasn't had
a moment's peace since he met us.

243
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,801
He's exhausted.

244
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,849
Check this out. In three, two, one.

245
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,090
Lights out.

246
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,205
Nap time!

247
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,126
Time to turn punishment into funishment.

248
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,247
You get it?

249
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,041
I took the "pun" in punishment,
and turned it into "fun,"

250
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,361
but kept the "ishment." It's word play!

251
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,450
What?

252
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,806
Hey, kid!

253
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,645
Wanna make a trade?
That's a nice-looking kite.

254
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,765
Yeah!

255
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,247
I can see Russia from here!

256
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,889
Come on, Simon, grab on.

257
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,568
Forget it. All I ever do is try to save him
and it only gets me in trouble!

258
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,171
This won't end well.

259
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,083
Simon, do something!

260
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,328
Seriously?

261
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,602
Simon, help!

262
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,330
Alvin's gotten himself in a bind.
Looks like it's Simon saving him again!

263
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,681
Thanks, bro.

264
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,566
No!

265
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,041
Thank you!

266
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,446
Hey!

267
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,604
Dave! Dave!

268
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,001
- Dave!
- Help us!

269
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,325
Guys! Guys!

270
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,571
No! No! No, no, no! No! No!

271
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,491
Dave! Help us!

272
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,250
Oh, yeah.

273
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,365
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

274
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,851
You want to go hang gliding,

275
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,922
sign up at the Excursion Desk
like everyone else.

276
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,082
- Ian, you don't understand!
- I think I do.

277
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,409
Dave Seville is so special
that the rules don't apply to him.

278
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,522
- Let go!
- No, you let go.

279
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,046
Hey! Come on! Great!

280
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,767
Oh, my God!

281
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,161
I need my pelican head!

282
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,641
Help!

283
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,042
- Ian!
- You idiot!

284
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,367
Oh, no. No, no.

285
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,723
Great. Way to go, Seville.

286
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,567
- Me?
- Yeah, you!

287
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,926
Hey!

288
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,441
Save your breath, Dave.
They'II come back for me.

289
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,080
In retrospect, this was a bad idea.

290
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,880
We're losing altitude!

291
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,684
I don't think I can make it much longer.

292
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,565
I'm so hungry. Just one bite.

293
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,127
No.

294
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,482
- A nibble?
- No nibbles.

295
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,762
Maybe I can just lick the glaze?

296
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,650
The glaze is what's
keeping you alive, Theodore!

297
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,042
Its high fat content
is creating a waterproof barrier.

298
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,088
I'm gonna starve to death!

299
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,482
Actually, there are many other things
that will kill you before starvation.

300
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,528
Dehydration, sunstroke...

301
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,726
An island.

302
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,485
No, an island would probably be helpful.

303
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,086
So if you see one,
you should definitely say something.

304
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,771
Jeanette?

305
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,966
We're alive! We're alive!

306
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,929
Good. Because now

307
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,131
I'm going to kill you!

308
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,283
Guys, guys, guys!
Nobody is killing anyone, okay?

309
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,522
No matter how much he deserves it.

310
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,042
Thank you, Si. Though I could have done
without the passive aggression.

311
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,441
Look, we've got nothing to worry about.

312
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,931
Dave knows we're gone by now.

313
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,571
He probably has
the whole coast guard looking for us.

314
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,645
Meantime, why don't we all just relax
and have some donut?

315
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,048
Did you guys want some?

316
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,761
Theodore! Alvin! Simon!

317
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,365
Can't you kick any faster?

318
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,363
It's been two hours, Dave.

319
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,324
Thanks to biannual Pilates classes,
I have legs that won't quit,

320
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,090
but they do slow down.

321
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,561
Take those feet off, let me kick.

322
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,722
They don't come off. It's one piece.

323
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,009
No quality mascot suit has removable feet.

324
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,289
Take the suit off, then.

325
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,607
- I can't.
- Why not?

326
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,969
I'm not wearing anything underneath.

327
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,007
Look!

328
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,809
No, no, it's okay, I believe you.

329
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,206
No, look!

330
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,124
Look, an island!

331
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,965
Maybe the chipmunks washed up there.

332
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,246
Kick!

333
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,001
Faster! Come on.

334
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,441
Okay, there we go.

335
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,131
It won't be long before
a rescue plane sees our SOS

336
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,727
and flies us back to civilization.

337
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,802
I don't hear any planes.

338
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,009
Or helicopters.

339
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,651
Maybe Dave is coming in a hot-air balloon.

340
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,643
Because those things are really quiet.

341
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,530
I don't think Dave is gonna be
in a hot-air balloon.

342
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,570
But he is coming, right?

343
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,642
Of course he is.

344
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,882
Just maybe not today.

345
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,446
Alvin's right.
We should prepare to stay the night.

346
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,127
What? You guys expect me
to sleep outside?

347
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,720
Last I checked, Brit, we're chipmunks.

348
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,644
We're used to living in the wild.

349
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,764
No, we used to be used to living in the wild.

350
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,923
Come on, Brit, it's just one night.

351
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,923
One cold night.

352
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,050
So we'II make a fire. We're always
setting things on fire accidentally.

353
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,885
How hard can it be
when we put our minds to it?

354
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,928
And how are you intending to do that?

355
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,965
I will create a spark by striking this rock
with my Swiss Army knife,

356
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,726
which Dave took from me.

357
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,566
I suppose you have a better idea,
smart guy?

358
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,361
As a matter of fact, I do, smart guy.

359
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,770
As you can see, the lens concentrates
the energy of the sun,

360
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,962
thus creating fire!

361
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,680
Impressive.

362
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,370
Thanks. Thank you.

363
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,891
Thanks for thinking that.

364
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,409
Hot, hot, hot!

365
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,010
We have made fire!

366
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,885
So, what do we do now?

367
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,722
Alvin! Brittany!

368
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,323
We've gotta head inland.

369
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,126
If we climb to the top of that mountain,

370
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,368
we'II be able to get
a better view of the island,

371
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,169
see if they're here.

372
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,322
All right, got it.

373
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,484
What are you doing?

374
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,449
- Building a fire.
- What?

375
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,000
You know, one time in the studio,
Snoop ran out of matches,

376
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,487
got a blaze going
with just two carrot sticks.

377
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,925
Figure, how hard can it be?

378
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,684
Forget the fire. We have to start hiking.

379
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,809
Yeah, okay, Dave.
Look, it's getting dark-ish.

380
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,451
It's gonna be cold. I'm gonna build a fire.
We'II go in the morning.

381
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,527
No, we'II go now.

382
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,682
Don't take that tone of voice
with me, Dave.

383
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,922
I'm not one of your chipmunks
that you can just boss around

384
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,565
and stuff into a cage
whenever you feel like it.

385
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,880
That was you, Ian!

386
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,004
Calm down.

387
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,448
Jeez, no wonder those furballs
would rather fly off the ship

388
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,767
than spend another day with you.

389
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,848
They didn't do it on purpose.

390
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,571
It was an accident. They're just kids.

391
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,087
I don't know how long
they can survive out there.

392
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,722
And you guys were worried. Look at us!

393
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,727
We're warm, we got a great fire going,
beautiful night sky

394
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,600
and if a rescue helicopter comes by,
they'II see us!

395
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,569
Everything's gonna be fine.

396
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,926
Good night, guys.

397
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,971
- Good night.
- Good night.

398
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,809
Good night.

399
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,765
Night.

400
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,330
Theodore!

401
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,967
What? Dave always turns off the light
after saying good night.

402
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,964
That fire was sort of the only thing
keeping us from freezing to death.

403
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,646
- Yeah!
- Can't you just relight it?

404
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,441
- How?
- With your glasses. And the sun?

405
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,087
All right! Way to keep the spirits up, guys.

406
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,650
Doing it, yeah!

407
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,242
- And what is this supposed to be?
- Breakfast!

408
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,481
No, it's bark.

409
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,484
Yeah, for breakfast!

410
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,561
I bet it's very good.

411
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,246
It's not.

412
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,722
It's been forever
since our last all-you-can-eat buffet.

413
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,961
Crazy suggestion, guys,

414
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,283
Iet's get off this beach
and let's find some real food.

415
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:26,006
If I know my horticulture, and I do,
this is a grove of mango trees.

416
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,481
Then where are all the mangoes?

417
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,042
Maybe the Jungle Monster 4 ate them all!

418
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,004
You were planning on sharing that, right?

419
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,371
Of course.

420
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,680
Well, good.

421
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,604
'Cause it kind of looked like
you were gonna eat it all by yourself.

422
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,406
What? I would never do that.

423
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,204
I don't believe you!

424
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,567
Hey!

425
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,409
Yeah! Winning!

426
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,326
What?

427
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,731
I'll make sure to save you the pit!

428
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,091
My acorns!

429
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,003
Way to go, Theodore!
Come on, we'II split it.

430
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,241
Don't listen to him, Theo.

431
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,084
He's gonna eat it all by himself.

432
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,366
I'll share it with you.

433
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,323
No. She's trying to trick you.

434
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,283
No, you're trying to trick him.

435
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,081
No, you're trying to trick him
by saying I'm trying to trick him.

436
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,525
He's lying, Theo!

437
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,250
What?

438
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,521
Theodore, I am so sorry!

439
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,724
Oh, no!

440
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,643
My precious! My precious!

441
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,445
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Look at us.

442
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,320
One day on this island
and we've become animals!

443
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,961
Did you hear that?

444
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,847
- What was that?
- Jungle Monster.

445
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,291
Positions, everybody.

446
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,521
Hold.

447
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,604
Hold.

448
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,246
Fire!

449
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,520
No! Why?

450
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,847
Please don't eat us, Mr. Jungle Monster!

451
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,641
I'm not a monster, I'm Zoe.
And I'm clearly a girl

452
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,442
who has been on this island for so long

453
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,804
that now she's imagining
that squirrels can talk.

454
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,484
We are chipmunks.

455
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,642
Yeah, Alvin and the Chipmunks.

456
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,726
Who and the what now?

457
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,610
I'm sure you've heard of the Chipettes.
We're kind of world famous.

458
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,886
Who?

459
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,690
Maybe this will help.

460
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,810
- Okay. Stop.
- Lame!

461
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,370
I don't know who you are.

462
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,250
Awkward!

463
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,567
Exactly how long have you been here?

464
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,769
Well, I got here on a Monday, so...

465
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,170
Yeah, like, you know, eight or nine years?

466
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,045
Nine years? Wait.
You've been here nine years?

467
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,571
Well, it could be eight.

468
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,644
What if we're here nine years?

469
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,961
What if we're here forever?

470
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,208
I told you, Dave's coming.

471
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,802
I used to think that Dave was coming, too.

472
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,524
And he never did.

473
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,566
Dave Henderson, my supervisor at UPS.

474
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,529
I used to fly cargo planes for them,

475
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,689
until one day I crash-landed in the ocean.

476
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,764
- We crash-landed, too.
- Really?

477
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,128
But our Dave won't rest until he finds us.

478
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,361
Right, Alvin?

479
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,960
Absolutely.

480
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,283
You mean I'm finally gonna get out of here?

481
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,241
I can't wait to go tell the others!

482
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,406
There are others?

483
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,086
I mean, can you guys imagine
being stuck here for all these years

484
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,810
without anybody to talk to?

485
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,928
I think I'd lose my mind!

486
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,691
Chipmunks,
I'm pleased to introduce my friends.

487
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,970
This is Rawlings, Spalding, Callaway,
Dunlop, and, right there, that's Nerf.

488
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,883
Hey, girlfriend, you look good.

489
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,169
They survived the crash with me.

490
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,890
Okay.

491
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,961
- Hi.
- Hi.

492
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,041
- Hello.
- Okay.

493
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,281
I'm Theodore.

494
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,204
Guys, Dave is coming to get us!

495
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,971
No, not Dave Henderson. I saw your face!

496
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,527
It's another Dave.

497
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,207
But, you guys, just get excited.
We're finally gonna get off this island.

498
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,401
She's funny.

499
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,642
In a crazy sort of way.

500
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,371
This totally calls for a party. Who's hungry?

501
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,646
- Yeah!
- Yes, please!

502
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,926
- I'm hungry.
- We are famished.

503
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,280
Yeah? Let's go to my place.

504
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,523
Is it far?
I don't think I could walk another step.

505
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,763
Who said anything about walking?

506
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,921
We're gonna die!

507
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,041
Oh, man! That was so cool!

508
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,242
I know, I know!

509
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,130
Come on. Come on in, guys! Bring it in.

510
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,043
Come on down!

511
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,487
Yeah! Wasn't that awesome?

512
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,129
No, it was not awesome.
It's a miracle we got here safely.

513
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,804
In fact, the odds of a chipmunk

514
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,611
getting hurt on a zip-line are one out of six.

515
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,006
Why do I always have to be right?

516
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,925
Ellie, Ellie! Are you okay?

517
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,889
I think I sprained my ankle!

518
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,043
You know what,
you should put some ice on that.

519
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,690
No, guys, I don't have any ice.
I live there in that tree.

520
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,881
I thought that maybe you did, though.

521
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,725
No, we don't have any ice.
Just like we don't have any shelter.

522
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,963
Wow, that's a major bummer for you.

523
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,321
- Do you guys like bungee jumping?
- Yes!

524
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,811
No. We do not.

525
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,082
Listen, lady, maybe you
should just leave us alone

526
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,811
so we can focus more on surviving
and less on killing ourselves.

527
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,289
Whoa, that is a lot of uptight
in a very little package.

528
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,684
I'm not uptight. I just don't wanna see
anyone else getting hurt.

529
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,610
Criminy. What was that?

530
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,011
You know what, that was just a spider

531
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,208
and they live here because this is nature.

532
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,051
It is not just a spider,
it's a <i>Phoneutria bahiensis.</i>

533
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,009
Its bite contains a neurotoxin.

534
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,890
Mr. Fancy Words. So what?

535
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,043
Alvin, toxin? Poison? Neuro? Brain?

536
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,809
That's not good.

537
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,884
Side effects include changes in personality,

538
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,129
Ioss of inhibition, dry mouth.

539
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,727
Okay, calm down. I get bitten probably
twice a day by these little fellows

540
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,808
and I am still completely normal.

541
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,848
Yes, normal.

542
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,763
Oh, no.

543
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,771
Alvin? Simon!

544
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,842
Chubby one!

545
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,763
Girl chubby one!

546
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,047
Brittany? Jeanette?

547
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,125
I hope they're okay.

548
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,931
Who cares if they're okay?
I just need them to be here.

549
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,927
And here I am thinking you've changed
and don't only care about yourself.

550
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,526
Nope. And it's a good thing, too.

551
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,921
Because right now the rage I'm feeling
for you and those chipmunks

552
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,327
is the only thing keeping me going.

553
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,687
Shall we keep going?

554
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,525
Ian, just keep an eye out for something
to eat or drink, all right?

555
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,523
All right. Right there!

556
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,010
- Where?
- That thing around your neck.

557
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,970
You're not gonna eat this.
This was a gift from Theodore.

558
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,646
That explains it.
I was gonna say, it's really ugly.

559
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,491
Like, really... Wow.

560
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,400
- Ugly.
- It's not ugly.

561
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,490
It goes with everything
and it's soft enough to sleep in.

562
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,681
Yeah, and it's edible.

563
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,890
You will not eat my son's necklace.

564
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,243
He's not your son, Dave.
He's just a chipmunk.

565
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,321
Dave. Where are you?

566
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,442
Where are you, Alvin?

567
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,605
All right.

568
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,530
I'm gonna crash.

569
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,161
Simon. Where are you going?

570
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,647
Who is this Simon you speak of?

571
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,330
You?

572
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,762
No, my name is not Simon. It is

573
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,930
Simone!

574
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,368
That's pretty close to Simon.

575
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,169
And yet completely different.

576
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,601
Would you care to join me
on my adventure?

577
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,006
What adventure?

578
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,560
The adventure called life!

579
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,441
Okay.

580
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,922
But just until Dave shows up.

581
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,609
Alvin, Alvin!

582
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,131
Simon and Theodore are gone.

583
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,370
They probably just went
to get stuff for the shelter.

584
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,051
It's all the guy can talk about.

585
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,566
Still, it's not like them
to wander off like that.

586
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,244
Could you please go look for them?

587
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,243
Why can't you?

588
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,483
I have a situation of my own
to deal with, Alvin.

589
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,171
Right. How is Eleanor doing?

590
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,401
She's fine. I'm talking about me.

591
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,563
It's been two days since my last bath
and I am a mess.

592
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,086
I can't get rescued looking like this.

593
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,285
Oy.

594
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,007
Theo! Simon! Simon!

595
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,010
Theodore! Theo!

596
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,682
Si! Theo!

597
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,125
<i>Bonjour,</i> my friend.

598
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,808
Simon? Are you bungee jumping?

599
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,531
- His name is not Simon.
- It is Simone.

600
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,885
That's pretty close to Simon.

601
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,851
Yeah, I thought so, too.
But he's acting totally different.

602
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,449
The spider bite! That's it!
Remember the side effects?

603
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,921
Personality changes, loss of inhibition?

604
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,201
Lies! Who are you?

605
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,090
Wow! Simone is pretty cool.

606
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,289
It's Simon, Theodore. And, no, he's not.

607
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,203
<i>Au revoir,</i> Alfred.

608
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,449
Alvin. It's Alvin!

609
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,802
<i>C'est magnifique,</i> Simone!

610
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,882
Okay, Theo, it's all you.

611
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,440
Really? I've never done anything like this.

612
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,851
And you never will.

613
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,048
How can you let him do this?
What are you thinking?

614
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,124
I'm thinking, "When did my dad
wash up on this island?"

615
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,049
- What?
- We were having the best time.

616
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,571
Why do you have to show up
and be so uptight?

617
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,804
Me? Uptight?

618
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,326
I'm not the uptight one, I'm the fun one!

619
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,323
The cool one. Ask anybody.

620
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,447
Who should I ask?

621
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,330
Come on.
Theodore, you can't bungee jump.

622
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,368
You get scared just watching a movie.

623
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,726
Munk up, Alvin.

624
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,929
A little help?

625
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,607
Much better.

626
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:53,129
Jeanette, these dresses are, like,
totally adorbs. I die.

627
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,080
Thank you.
And I also made these for you, Eleanor.

628
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,489
Look how handy you are all of a sudden.

629
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,764
And in case you get tired,
I made you a wheelchair.

630
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,011
Super.

631
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,963
<i>Enchanté, mademoiselles.</i> A kiss.

632
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,964
A kiss. And a...

633
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,291
A kiss.

634
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,409
- What's gotten into him?
- Spider venom.

635
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,729
Yeah, yeah, he thinks he's some sort
of fun-loving French dude.

636
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,370
- Really?
- Now he thinks he's...

637
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,324
The most interesting munk in the world.

638
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,209
Simon? Simon.

639
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,961
Simone?

640
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,161
I think we should
get to work on that shelter.

641
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,448
I cannot imagine
a better roof over our heads

642
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,124
than the stars in the sky.

643
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,528
What about the kind of roof
over our head that's actually a roof?

644
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,840
It's going to rain!

645
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,287
What is a little rain?

646
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:01,445
We cherish the water,
for it is the water that nurtures the flower.

647
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,409
Okay. This is crazy!

648
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,131
Building a shelter was your idea. Yours!

649
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,120
Great. Great!

650
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,487
All right, guys, we're gonna build a shelter.

651
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,443
I need everyone's help. Let's go.

652
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,729
I'll try. But I feel so useless.

653
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,321
- What are you doing?
- What I've wanted to do

654
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,802
since the moment I laid my eyes
all over on you.

655
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,961
What?

656
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,531
Hey, you guys
are going to catch pneumonia

657
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,761
dancing in the rain like that.

658
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,282
You ought to be careful
kicking mud around like that.

659
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,367
Hello?

660
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,323
Someone could lose an eye!

661
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,244
That looks like fun.

662
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,843
- Eleanor? Would you care to dance?
- I'd love to.

663
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,002
- With me?
- Yes, Theodore!

664
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,888
I can't believe
Jeanette's getting all the attention.

665
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,521
I'm the pretty one.
Jeanette's the smart one.

666
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,161
You don't see me running around
trying to be all smart, do you?

667
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,441
I know! I'm the fun one,

668
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,090
- you're the pretty one.
- Yeah!

669
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,171
Do you know how slippery that dirt is?
This is ridiculous.

670
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,725
Are you even listening to me?

671
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,280
Simon!

672
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,362
Alvin? You're starting to sound like Dave.

673
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,445
No!

674
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,330
What are you doing?

675
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,924
Building a shelter.

676
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,048
Since I'm not the fun one anymore

677
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,805
I figure I may as well be

678
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,529
the responsible one.

679
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,646
Really?

680
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,046
Well, since I'm not the pretty one anymore,
maybe I should build a shelter, too.

681
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,924
Yeah, good luck with that.

682
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,610
What, you don't think I could do it?

683
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,808
Hey, I didn't say that, Brit.

684
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,129
I thought it, but I didn't say it.

685
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,521
So you wanna play it this way.

686
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,121
He's so French.

687
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,645
Be careful, Simone!

688
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,005
Let's do it.

689
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,605
Oh, no.

690
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,002
Now, wasn't that a pleasant ride?

691
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,001
Good thing we don't wear pants.

692
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,321
Okay, you guys, come on, come over.

693
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,006
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Of course it's safe.

694
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,082
I do this thing every day.

695
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,880
- Jeanette!
- Jeanette!

696
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,450
Hold on, Jeanette.

697
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,487
No, no. Look into my eyes.

698
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,289
You have nothing to fear.

699
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,565
Yes, yes. Very good.

700
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,521
You are safe. Bravo!

701
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,284
- You made it!
- You're so brave.

702
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,643
Pretty.

703
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:12,125
Double rainbow. What does it mean?

704
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,727
Alive they're superstars, sure. But dead?
They're legends.

705
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,565
I'm talking about tribute albums,
pay-per-view funerals.

706
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,804
Wait a second. You actually think
I'm in this for the money?

707
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,764
Well, if you're doing it to pick up chicks,
you're doing a lousy job.

708
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,360
I'm doing this because I love them, okay?

709
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,084
Look, if you wanna spend
the rest of your life

710
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,130
running around after a bunch
of spoiled brats, be my guest.

711
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,601
- They're not brats.
- Really? Even Alvin?

712
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,371
You never even bothered
to get to know them, Ian.

713
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,451
I mean, sure, Alvin can be kind of a handful,

714
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,931
but he means well.

715
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,528
He's sometimes just
a little irresponsible, that's all.

716
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,801
But, come on, Simon?

717
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,242
He's probably the most
level-headed kid I know.

718
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,408
If anything, he's a little too uptight.

719
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,883
And then there's little Theodore.

720
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:32,648
Dave, I barely cared about what you
had to say about the first two.

721
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,963
I can't imagine the big-boned one
is gonna be any more interesting.

722
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,571
Forget it, let's just keep going.

723
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,801
Up, <i>poisson,</i> up!

724
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,604
Oh, no. This is terrible.

725
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,364
Shouldn't he have come up by now?

726
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,441
Simone! Where are you?

727
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,522
Zoe, you've gotta do something.

728
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,931
All right.

729
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,970
Callaway, I need you to go in there
and find Simone.

730
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,610
I know you can do it, little buddy.

731
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,770
You're kidding, right?

732
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,124
If Callaway can't find him, nobody can.

733
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,371
Simone!

734
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,641
Told you.

735
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,724
I'm sorry if I caused you
any worry, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

736
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,647
But I have something for you.
Maybe this will be a way to make it up.

737
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,410
It's beautiful!

738
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,569
Where did you find it?

739
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,564
Yeah, it is beautiful. Where did you find it?

740
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,004
In a cave behind the waterfall.

741
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,650
I thought it would look nice on you.

742
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:23,049
But now I realize even the most precious
gem cannot compare to your beauty.

743
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,841
Yeah. Were there any other jewels
or gems or diamonds

744
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,160
or anything else in there?

745
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,924
By the time I found the gold,

746
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,163
I had already been gone
from my Jeanette far too long.

747
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,365
What?

748
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,891
You guys, they found it. They found it!

749
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,963
And the best part is,
they don't even know what they found.

750
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,923
They think that it's just one bracelet.

751
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,520
Which means that
the rest of the treasure is mine.

752
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,887
All mine!

753
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,807
What the...

754
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,529
What are you?

755
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,404
Hey!

756
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,086
Yeah, you're one of those honey badgers.

757
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,043
You just take what you want.

758
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,487
Drop it. Drop it!

759
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,085
You mess with me, <i>ése,</i>

760
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,810
I'll go <i>loco</i> on you.

761
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,361
Hey!

762
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,605
Give it back!

763
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,684
You can sting like a bee
or strike like a cobra,

764
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,326
but this honey munk don't care!

765
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,080
Okay, Brit, I'm all done.

766
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,243
If you want, I can help you get started...

767
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,726
This tree house is awesome.

768
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,041
Maybe you are kind of the smart one.

769
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,248
Thank you, Alvin. And yours is...

770
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,927
Well,

771
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,290
you did your best.

772
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,609
Anyhoo, no reason we can't be
comfortable and stylish

773
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,126
while we wait for Dave to show up, right?

774
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,689
Brit, I...

775
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,651
I think I know why Dave hasn't come.

776
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,563
You do? Why?

777
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,961
'Cause he's not even looking.

778
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,527
Alvin, why wouldn't he be looking for us?

779
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,689
Because I drive him crazy.

780
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,202
You know, the way Simon's
been driving me crazy?

781
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,204
I mean, that's what I've been doing to Dave.

782
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,123
For years.

783
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,525
No wonder he hates me.

784
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,922
Don't worry, Alvin.

785
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,604
I'm sure Dave will come.

786
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,969
I mean, he certainly loves
Simon and Theodore.

787
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,164
Simon? Is Dave ever gonna find us?

788
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,601
Simon? I mean, Simone?

789
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,848
I'm so sorry, were you speaking to <i>moi?</i>

790
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,486
Yes! About Dave!

791
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,291
Are we ever going to find him?

792
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,207
I see you are sad, <i>mon ami.</i>

793
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,449
And I hate to see you sad.

794
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,803
I will help you find your friend Dave.

795
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,087
You really think you can find him?

796
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,406
I know I can!

797
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,288
And then I will find this Simon
you keep speaking of!

798
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,724
As Dave and I have never met,
I will need you to describe him for me.

799
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:47,408
Well, he's very kind and a good storyteller.

800
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,484
Very helpful.

801
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,086
And he's about this tall.

802
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:58,646
Is he by any chance a big, flightless bird?

803
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,371
I don't think so.

804
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:04,442
Then these footprints must not be his.

805
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,082
Jungle Monster!

806
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,362
Do you hear that?

807
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,885
Yeah, it's my stomach grumbling.

808
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,123
No, no, maybe it's a helicopter! Listen!

809
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,369
Face it, Dave,
no one is coming to rescue us, okay?

810
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,529
And my stomach noises are gonna get
louder and louder and louder

811
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,041
until one day they just stop.

812
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,970
Because I will have eaten you.

813
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,565
Maybe you're right.
Maybe no one's coming.

814
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,610
Maybe the chipmunks aren't here at all.
Maybe they're gone.

815
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,488
I really messed up.

816
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:56,328
Dave, it kills me to say this, kills me, but...

817
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,162
Look, man,

818
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,690
you're really good with those kids,
really good.

819
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:06,966
They love you.

820
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:11,241
And I should know because I was really
bad with those kids and they hate me.

821
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,571
But, look, you should know
that whatever happens,

822
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,802
you did nothing wrong. Nothing.

823
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,490
Thanks, Ian.

824
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,047
Come here.

825
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,328
Yeah. Yeah.

826
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,686
Ian?

827
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,010
Ian?

828
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,205
Ian!

829
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,328
The Jungle Monster's real! And it's angry!

830
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:51,125
Or hungry. <i>Allons-y!</i>

831
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,004
That means let's go.

832
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,849
Great, a volcano.

833
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,804
Of course!
That's why the water was so hot!

834
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,129
It's being heated
by the underground magma chamber!

835
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,641
- How do you know that?
- I have no idea!

836
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:26,082
The place where I get my nails done
always has the Science Channel on.

837
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,089
Maybe I accidentally paid attention.

838
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,282
Hey, guys, anyone up for a quick hike?

839
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,727
Like, I don't know,
maybe to the waterfall or whatever?

840
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,531
Not now, Zoe!
The whole island is going to explode!

841
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,647
What?

842
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,282
Guys, we've got to get off this island.
We have to build a raft, now.

843
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,084
"Right now" Iike, right now?

844
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,170
Or "right now" Iike,
after a hike to the waterfall now?

845
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,683
I've been hit!

846
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,329
By Dave's necklace?

847
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:06,650
Tell Jeanette I will watch over her
with angel wings.

848
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,084
Dave?

849
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,491
Theodore!

850
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,489
Dave?

851
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,050
Told you we'd find him!

852
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,360
Simon!

853
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,371
It is Simone, but I am often confused
for this Simon fellow.

854
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,970
Perhaps we look alike?

855
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:40,011
- Simone?
- Ian!

856
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,760
Hey, you found the chubby one.

857
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:44,881
Don't worry, Theodore.

858
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,327
Nothing's gonna happen to you. Is it?

859
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,244
What was that?

860
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,681
That's an active volcano.

861
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,845
Okay, Brittany and I will build the deck.

862
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,327
Eleanor, you need to start braiding ropes.

863
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,643
Jeanette, find as many coconuts
and mangoes as you can.

864
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,882
Who knows how long we'II be out there.

865
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,724
What can I do to help?

866
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,569
- Dave!
- Dave!

867
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,371
Dave!

868
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,528
- You found us!
- Hey.

869
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,244
We missed you so much.

870
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,691
I knew you would find us.

871
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,161
Eleanor! What happened?

872
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,608
You know, just a zip-line accident.

873
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,404
- A what?
- I'm fine.

874
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,370
It only hurts when I try to explain it.

875
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,488
Okay, you know what, never mind.

876
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,887
The important thing is you guys are safe.

877
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,081
Alvin?

878
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,602
Everything's gonna be okay.

879
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,449
Hey, what is it?

880
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,848
I thought you'd never find us.

881
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,400
That you weren't even looking.

882
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,604
Why wouldn't I look for you?

883
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,961
Because I'm such a pain in the...

884
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,491
Alvin.

885
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,921
I know, you don't think I'm a pain.

886
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:24,602
No, you're a pain.
But I'd come, no matter what.

887
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:37,688
Arc de Triomphe, mayonnaise, Napoleon.

888
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,570
I get it, Frenchie,
you come from a rich history.

889
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,564
Well, guess what, we're all gonna be
history if we don't get out of here.

890
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,042
Uncle Ian!

891
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,804
What's he doing here?

892
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,160
It's kind of a long story.

893
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:50,651
Don't worry, he's cool.

894
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,922
Yes, for a pelican man.

895
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,447
Yeah, nothing cooler than
a grown man in a pelican suit.

896
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,642
So, Dave,
how are we gonna get out of here?

897
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,726
I don't know, Alvin,
I think you've got this under control.

898
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,564
Theodore,
you and Eleanor are on rope duty.

899
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,120
Dave and Ian, we need oars.

900
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,204
Simone, you and Jeanette
are in charge of food.

901
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,448
- And, Zoe...
- No, I know, I know.

902
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,603
I'm gonna go
and I'm gonna pack up my balls!

903
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,489
Who's that?

904
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,648
Another long story.

905
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:29,009
Yeah! Good work, guys!
Let's get off this island.

906
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,646
This raft won't build itself.

907
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,650
Go! Go! Go!

908
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:47,645
- Heave!
- Ho!

909
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,800
- Heave!
- Ho!

910
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,444
It's incredible, you guys.

911
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,931
Very impressive.

912
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,691
Just seeing everyone
come together to build it...

913
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,207
I just want to say...

914
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,131
It can wait.

915
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,680
Wait, where are Jeanette and Simone?

916
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:22,366
I hope this is going to be enough.

917
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,401
Did you hear something?

918
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,931
Who can say?

919
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:30,408
When I am with you, all I can hear
is the beating of my own heart.

920
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,682
Oh, Simone!

921
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,085
Oh, no!

922
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,810
Somebody! Help!

923
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,369
Jeanette?

924
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:14,764
Guys! Guys! Over here! Come quick, hurry!

925
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,850
- Simone, are you okay?
- Simone!

926
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,321
Why are you calling me Simone?

927
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,727
- Simon?
- Yeah.

928
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,841
You're back! It finally wore off!

929
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,405
What wore off?

930
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,723
You were bitten by a spider.
It, like, messed up your brain.

931
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,562
Is that why I think I see Dave

932
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,251
and a half-Ian, half-bird?

933
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:41,044
No, it's really me. And really Ian.

934
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,246
'Sup?

935
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:45,164
Simon, where's Jeanette?
She was out here with you.

936
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,089
Jeanette? I don't know...

937
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,400
I do.

938
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,289
It's Zoe. She took her.

939
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,762
Simon, I need to know
where you found that gold bracelet.

940
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,763
What gold bracelet?

941
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,490
The one you gave to Jeanette.

942
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,807
What? When did I give Jeanette a bracelet?

943
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:00,967
On your date.

944
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,201
Jeanette and I are dating?

945
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,248
Okay, he's useless.

946
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:08,164
Theodore, Eleanor,
you're gonna have to lead the way.

947
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:11,204
I don't remember exactly how to get there.

948
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,331
I do!

949
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,965
Which way, Eleanor?

950
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:19,089
Make a left. No, right. No, left!

951
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,083
I thought you said
you knew where you were going.

952
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:24,642
I do! Sometimes I just forget
my left from my right.

953
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,569
That way!

954
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:31,170
Okay, we just have to cross here.

955
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,322
Are you kidding me?

956
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:34,970
Guys, I can't do that.

957
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:38,010
But, Simon, you already did.

958
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:41,444
No, I didn't.
That was Simone, that was not me.

959
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,888
But Simone is you.
He's in there somewhere.

960
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,805
You just have to find him, <i>tout de suite.</i>

961
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,888
Because Jeanette needs you, Simon.

962
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,402
No, I'm sorry, I just can't do it.

963
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,483
All right, Ian, get everyone to the raft.

964
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,568
If the volcano blows
before I make it out of here,

965
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:05,801
you have to promise me you'II...

966
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,370
Leave without you. Got it.

967
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,247
Okay.

968
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,963
Dave.

969
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,320
I'm coming with you.

970
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,129
Absolutely not, it's too dangerous.

971
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:30,446
Remember I said
someday I may need to disobey you?

972
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:34,408
Sorry, Dave, but I gotta disobey you.

973
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,647
Let's go.

974
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:54,086
You're not coming up until you have
every last bit of that treasure.

975
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:58,486
But the volcano is about to explode!

976
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:01,763
Well, then I guess you better hurry, huh?

977
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,451
Run, go, go. In you go.

978
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:08,169
Get down there. That's right.

979
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,611
Keep going!

980
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,802
<i>S.O.S.</i>

981
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:15,851
<i>Please someone help me</i>

982
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:21,763
<i>It's not healthy for me to feel this</i>

983
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:25,162
<i>Y.O.U. are</i>

984
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,966
<i>Making it hard</i>

985
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:33,449
<i>I can't help it</i>
<i>See, it don't feel right</i>

986
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,963
Keep moving!

987
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,969
<i>This time, please</i>

988
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:42,324
<i>Someone come and rescue me</i>

989
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:52,281
Okay! Pull me up. I can't hold any more.

990
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,603
If you can still talk, it means
you haven't stuffed your cheeks yet!

991
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,322
Yes! That sounds very good.

992
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,924
Jeanette!

993
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,650
Dave!

994
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,970
They're supposed to be
behind that waterfall!

995
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:15,166
That's right. That's what I'm talking about.

996
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:19,089
- Zoe!
- No, no. Not another step.

997
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,083
Don't come any closer.

998
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,645
Are you all right, Jeanette?

999
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:27,849
I'm pretty freaked out,

1000
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,611
and those earrings tasted awful.

1001
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,849
Zoe, you don't have to do this.

1002
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,891
I don't?
I spent 10 years looking for this treasure.

1003
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:41,487
It's the whole reason
why I came to this stinking island!

1004
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,642
You mean you didn't crash-land?

1005
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:48,527
They said that I was crazy
and they said that this map was a fake.

1006
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,206
And now the treasure is mine!

1007
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,247
Run!

1008
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:59,885
Jeanette, come on, come on.

1009
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,166
Run!

1010
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,769
No, you don't!

1011
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:13,530
Jeanette!

1012
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,250
Oh, no!

1013
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,086
Help, help!

1014
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,770
Oh, no, help!

1015
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,002
You're going back in that cave,

1016
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,084
and you are going to get me more treasure.

1017
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,366
Jeanette!

1018
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,488
- Simone!
- It's Simon!

1019
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:05,289
Alvin!

1020
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:14,567
No!

1021
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,845
- Hurry!
- Come on, guys, go!

1022
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,769
Go, go!

1023
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,126
Come on, come on.

1024
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:38,801
Look!

1025
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:41,687
Come on!

1026
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,844
Run!

1027
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,571
But where's Dave?

1028
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,366
- Help me up!
- Help you up?

1029
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,926
Is that what I'm supposed to do now, Dave?

1030
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,844
All I had was my treasure,
and now it's gone.

1031
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:01,764
Do you get that? My life is ruined.

1032
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,002
And now you're gonna know
how that feels.

1033
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,644
No, no!

1034
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,131
It's tempting to blame Dave.

1035
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,129
I know. I've been there.

1036
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:13,562
I wish I could get back all those years
I spent plotting my revenge.

1037
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,160
All that time and energy, wasted.

1038
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,487
All those pizzas
I had delivered to his house, wasted.

1039
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,607
That was you?

1040
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,682
Not now, Dave! All right?

1041
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,969
You could let Dave fall to his death

1042
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,082
and I could go back
to the raft with the chipmunks,

1043
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:29,090
become their manager again
and make tons of money.

1044
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,407
So, really, I'm good either way.

1045
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:33,930
But let me tell you something.

1046
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:37,403
Hate, anger, regret,

1047
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,961
those aren't just members
of a girl group I once signed.

1048
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:43,010
They're what consumed me.
And they're consuming you.

1049
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,447
It's not too late to do the right thing.

1050
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,326
Or not. Again,

1051
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,363
I'm good either way, so...

1052
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,602
I don't want to sway you.

1053
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,530
What are you guys doing? Help me.

1054
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,604
Please. Help me save my dad!

1055
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,404
Hurry!

1056
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:02,766
I got you, Dave.

1057
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,321
Come on! Help me, guys.

1058
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,689
Wow!

1059
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,650
There they are!

1060
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:18,165
Come on!

1061
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,241
Faster!

1062
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,408
Hurry! Hurry!

1063
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,202
Let's go, go, go!

1064
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,044
Oh, no!

1065
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,122
- Get up!
- Hurry!

1066
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,521
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on!

1067
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,090
Run!

1068
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,284
Grab the oar!

1069
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,848
Come on! Come on, guys!

1070
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,769
Paddle!

1071
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,691
Come on! Paddle!

1072
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,521
Faster! Come on, hurry!

1073
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:31,361
Now we'II never get to perform
at the International Music Awards.

1074
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:34,484
I guess now we're the losers.

1075
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:42,769
Jeanette, I don't know what to say.

1076
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:46,890
I guess I was just so obsessed
with finding that treasure

1077
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,480
that I kind of... I lost it.

1078
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,650
And I'm...

1079
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,848
I'm really sorry.

1080
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,045
We both are.

1081
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,086
Well, apology accepted.

1082
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:05,724
Here, I want you to have this.

1083
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,204
Really?

1084
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,170
Look, Dunlop, this is a new beginning

1085
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:16,527
for both of us.

1086
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,290
I hope you don't mind.

1087
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,448
Simone gave it to me.

1088
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,130
I don't mind.

1089
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:31,647
You know, Jeanette,
even the most perfect gem

1090
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:34,963
cannot compare to your beauty.

1091
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:44,331
- Dave?
- Yes, Alvin?

1092
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,402
I just wanted to say

1093
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:51,088
now that we're not all, you know, dead,

1094
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,764
sorry.

1095
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,809
Sorry.

1096
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:58,246
Sorry I was acting like a child on the ship.

1097
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:04,089
And kind of maybe ruined
our family vacation.

1098
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:07,291
Sometimes a racehorse
needs a little room to run.

1099
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:11,806
Yes. Yeah. I like where your head's at.

1100
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,803
That is very wise, David.

1101
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,131
'Sup?

1102
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,570
What, no love for Uncle Ian?

1103
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,122
- You put us in cages!
- You put us in cages!

1104
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:26,203
Seriously? Are we still talking about that?

1105
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:29,124
New subject, I saved Dave's life.

1106
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,966
Okay, but I'll be watching you, mister.

1107
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,771
Alvin, you still have
that pocket knife I gave you?

1108
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:41,965
Knife? Right, sorry, I meant to give it back.

1109
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,371
I want you to keep it.

1110
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:44,761
Really?

1111
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:48,363
Maybe you can use it
to signal that helicopter.

1112
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,481
What?

1113
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:51,525
- Hey!
- Down here!

1114
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:53,290
Hello!

1115
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:59,484
It's me, Ian Hawke! Jet Records!

1116
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,402
Guys, circle around!

1117
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:06,848
<i>Everything's okay. We got you, guys!</i>

1118
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,010
It's good to be back, huh?

1119
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,241
Sure is.

1120
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:51,842
Sold Zoe's story to Hollywood.
Huge bidding war.

1121
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,649
Keira Knightley is interested.

1122
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,001
I'm thinking Fiddy Cent for me.

1123
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:21,361
Thank you!

1124
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:22,930
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

1125
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,964
- You're a great audience.
- We love you!

1126
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,930
I'm sorry, sir, that's full.

1127
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,650
We're gonna have to gate-check those.

1128
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,562
Are you gonna charge me 25 bucks a bag?

1129
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:54,880
Of course not, sir.

1130
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,367
It's $25 for the first bag

1131
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:00,370
and $40 for each additional bag.

1132
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:07,050
I'm a little chilly.
Would you mind adjusting the vent?

1133
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,650
But of course.

1134
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,531
- You wrinkled my business magazine.
- Sorry.

1135
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,330
Guess I'll have to read this.

1136
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,605
She's pretty.

1137
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,409
Wait, that's me.

1138
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,647
All right, head count.

1139
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:35,280
You like my Jungle Monster costume?
Eleanor made it for me.

1140
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,161
Yeah! Out of a barf bag!

1141
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,685
Nice.

1142
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,406
Where's Alvin?

1143
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,802
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>this is your captain speaking.</i>

1144
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:49,891
<i>We're cleared for an on-time departure</i>
<i>for Timbuktu.</i>

1145
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:53,688
<i>If Timbuktu is not for you,</i>

1146
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:57,646
<i>please alert the flight attendant</i>
<i>by pressing your call button.</i>

1147
01:19:58,720 --> 01:19:59,767
Alvin!

1148
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,128
<i>Thank you for choosing AirAlvin.</i>
<i>Enjoy your flight!</i>

1149
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:06,966
Sir, please return to your seat,
we're about to take off.

1150
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,201
Sit. Now.

1151
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,765
- But he...
- Sit!

1152
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,649
No, no, no!

1153
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:20,326
Alvin!

1154
01:20:26,640 --> 01:25:07,641
Remember the Name...!!!
