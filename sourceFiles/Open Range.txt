1
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:49,017
Open Range

2
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,884
Think she'll get over thisaway?

3
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,265
Might.

4
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,434
Best bed them down.

5
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:12,533
Come on, Tig.

6
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:55,660
There she goes.

7
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:02,793
Looks like we're in for it.

8
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:23,063
You see them?

9
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:29,737
Can't see them.
Can't hear them.

10
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:32,239
You ever seen one this bad?

11
00:03:32,282 --> 00:03:34,826
Not since Noah and the flood.

12
00:03:34,908 --> 00:03:39,622
Well, you should know, Boss,
since you was there.

13
00:03:39,663 --> 00:03:41,750
What did you say?

14
00:03:41,832 --> 00:03:45,754
He said, "You should know
since you was there. "

15
00:03:51,343 --> 00:03:54,220
Well, even that
wasn't this damn wet.

16
00:03:54,304 --> 00:03:55,722
One thing's certain.

17
00:03:55,805 --> 00:04:00,810
Noah never shoveled as much bull
from them he had aboard.

18
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:03,813
Let's rustle up some grub.

19
00:04:03,897 --> 00:04:05,857
Mose?

20
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:07,442
Hey!

21
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:11,613
- That hurt?
- Yeah.

22
00:04:11,655 --> 00:04:13,699
Mose, still got them cards?

23
00:04:13,782 --> 00:04:15,784
Yeah, I got them.

24
00:04:15,868 --> 00:04:19,245
Get them out, and let's have us
a game after breakfast.

25
00:04:31,926 --> 00:04:33,219
Button!

26
00:04:34,887 --> 00:04:36,806
Pull them plates under here.

27
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:44,063
You gonna play them cards, Mose,
or stare a hole through them?

28
00:04:44,146 --> 00:04:46,273
Don't rush me.

29
00:04:49,485 --> 00:04:51,904
I'll take four.

30
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:55,032
Oh, for pity's sakes.
"Take four. "

31
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:04,876
All right, that's it.

32
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:06,211
I'm out.

33
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:09,256
Me too.

34
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:17,556
A man's trust
is a valuable thing, Button.

35
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,684
You don't want to lose it
for a handful of cards.

36
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,245
Well, at least it ain't raining.

37
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,417
Get yourself dressed, Button.
Help Mose get things cleaned up.

38
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:30,089
Then you walk out
and look for them horses.

39
00:06:42,976 --> 00:06:46,355
Looks like you could use
a little muscle there, Charley.

40
00:06:50,317 --> 00:06:53,654
You just keep on like you are.

41
00:06:53,737 --> 00:06:56,907
You'll get your chance
soon enough.

42
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,666
No need to ask
for more chores, Mose.

43
00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:06,875
Every man's got to pull
his weight.

44
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,088
Yeah, but my weight
is half of yours.

45
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:17,303
You know, it's hard to figure
Charley sometimes.

46
00:07:17,344 --> 00:07:19,723
I ain't even sure
if he likes me.

47
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:21,807
He likes you.

48
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:28,356
You know, Boss had some pause
about hiring me on.

49
00:07:28,398 --> 00:07:32,444
Too big to get around on horses
and work them cows.

50
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:35,238
Afraid I'd eat too much.

51
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,198
It was Charley
that talked him into it,

52
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:39,701
and I ain't one to take
a man's confidence lightly.

53
00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:40,994
You know I ain't, either.

54
00:07:41,037 --> 00:07:43,914
I know you ain't, but it's best
to keep remembering it

55
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,499
if you want respect

56
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,669
when you're riding with men
like Charley and Boss.

57
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,203
Button, pull.

58
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:23,622
Pull it.

59
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,873
Button!

60
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,209
Button!

61
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:30,878
Quit playing with that dog
and pull the wagon!

62
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:37,802
Pull it!

63
00:08:43,725 --> 00:08:46,561
- Pull!
- Oh, yeah!

64
00:08:46,603 --> 00:08:49,314
Yeah.
That's it.

65
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:01,868
Hey, hey!
Look at that!

66
00:09:33,526 --> 00:09:36,237
Old Boss sure can cowboy,
can't he?

67
00:09:37,363 --> 00:09:38,823
Yeah.

68
00:09:38,865 --> 00:09:41,201
Broke the mold after him.

69
00:09:55,506 --> 00:09:57,426
Main bunch is working
towards water.

70
00:09:57,508 --> 00:09:59,260
We'll go up-country,
find the rest,

71
00:09:59,344 --> 00:10:01,095
and we'll push them there.

72
00:10:03,514 --> 00:10:05,351
Look at that.

73
00:10:07,353 --> 00:10:09,938
A couple of damn kids.

74
00:10:10,022 --> 00:10:11,315
Anyway, once we get them,

75
00:10:11,357 --> 00:10:14,360
we can start driving them back
closer to camp.

76
00:10:14,442 --> 00:10:16,904
It'll be a while
before we see another town.

77
00:10:16,987 --> 00:10:19,656
Could use supplies,
coffee and such.

78
00:10:20,824 --> 00:10:21,909
Mose!

79
00:10:21,992 --> 00:10:23,535
Ow!

80
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:25,037
Mose!

81
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:32,795
You'll have to ride back
to that town we passed.

82
00:10:32,878 --> 00:10:34,630
When you want me to go?

83
00:10:34,714 --> 00:10:36,549
Tonight.

84
00:10:36,632 --> 00:10:38,593
I'll go.

85
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:39,844
I can go.

86
00:10:39,886 --> 00:10:42,597
How long you figure, Charley?

87
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,934
Without cows slowing things,
maybe one day there, one back.

88
00:10:46,017 --> 00:10:47,559
Sounds about right.

89
00:10:47,644 --> 00:10:48,852
Come on, Boss.

90
00:10:48,895 --> 00:10:50,063
I can do it.

91
00:10:50,145 --> 00:10:51,690
Sure you can, boy.

92
00:10:51,773 --> 00:10:53,315
Just don't know
if that town's ready

93
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,528
to have you
turned loose on it just yet.

94
00:10:57,821 --> 00:10:59,155
English!

95
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:00,865
Damn! Shit!

96
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:02,575
Bullshit!

97
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:18,987
By God, if you're gonna pick
your feet like a monkey,

98
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,239
you do it downwind.

99
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:27,496
Swear to God, old Tig
takes better care of herself.

100
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,165
Starting to think
it was a mistake

101
00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:32,459
not getting you on in some town
to learn a trade.

102
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,004
I don't like towns.
Never liked them.

103
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,715
Oh, you're just saying that
'cause you heard me say it.

104
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,758
Get yourself a trade
and set up in a town.

105
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:41,718
You'll always have
a roof over your head,

106
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:42,887
a bed up off the ground,

107
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:45,972
and food no further away
than a café.

108
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:48,768
Ain't that so, Charley?

109
00:12:51,728 --> 00:12:53,106
That was a big help.

110
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:55,358
Might as well be talking
to this horse.

111
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:59,153
Put your boot on, Button.
Let's go to work.

112
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,867
Course, if you was to live
in a town...

113
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,245
You'd have to clean up some.

114
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,833
Otherwise, no one
could stand the stink.

115
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,387
What you do that for?!

116
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,021
Cheating at cards.

117
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:40,529
Cheating.

118
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,780
I apologized to you for that!

119
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,785
Eh, Boss?
I apologized to him for that.

120
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:49,496
Evidently he ain't over it yet.

121
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:11,560
It's getting dark, Boss.

122
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:15,147
He could have got hurt
between that town and the camp.

123
00:14:15,231 --> 00:14:17,608
Probably just taking his time.

124
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,486
Don't suppose he got into
a poker game, do you?

125
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,781
Wouldn't gamble
your money, Boss.

126
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:27,494
What if he's lying out there
waiting for us to come along?

127
00:14:27,577 --> 00:14:31,289
We'd never find him tonight.
Now, come on down from there.

128
00:14:31,373 --> 00:14:33,123
He's worried.

129
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,377
- You worried?
- Yeah, I'm worried.

130
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,173
Been worried since yesterday.
Should have sent me.

131
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:41,341
Mose can look out for himself.

132
00:14:41,424 --> 00:14:43,426
Then why ain't he here with us?

133
00:14:43,468 --> 00:14:46,347
Well, you never was
wanting to go to towns.

134
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:48,765
Well, I don't want to go now
neither.

135
00:14:48,808 --> 00:14:51,686
But we better find him,
wherever he is.

136
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:56,399
All right.

137
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:59,694
You and me strike out early.
Button can watch the outfit.

138
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:04,031
Button, come on down from there
and get supper a-working.

139
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:17,461
Most likely be back
before suppertime.

140
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,463
But three sets of eyes,
it's better than two.

141
00:15:19,505 --> 00:15:22,591
- You stay with the wagon.
- Come on, Boss.

142
00:15:22,675 --> 00:15:23,926
No one is gonna bother it.

143
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,096
We haven't seen a single person
since we set up the camp.

144
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:30,266
I always feel better
if someone's close around.

145
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:34,228
You been working hard,
deserve a little loafing time.

146
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:36,188
Stay right here.

147
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:40,694
Stay, Tig.

148
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:41,862
Wants to go.

149
00:15:41,944 --> 00:15:44,530
She acts like she does,
but she don't.

150
00:15:44,614 --> 00:15:48,285
Still got the heart,
not the legs.

151
00:15:49,535 --> 00:15:52,039
You keep that rifle close.

152
00:17:02,777 --> 00:17:06,573
Always liked me a sidearm
with some heft.

153
00:17:06,615 --> 00:17:10,410
Took this off a man who couldn't
pay all he owed for some cows.

154
00:17:10,452 --> 00:17:12,286
Damn fine weapon.

155
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:16,834
Always noticed you favor
something light, don't you?

156
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:42,109
Set it right down.
Thank you.

157
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:33,662
Hello!

158
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:41,461
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

159
00:18:41,545 --> 00:18:44,506
Like to feed and water them,
curry them down with saddles on.

160
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,677
Okay, that'll be four bits each.

161
00:18:47,718 --> 00:18:50,179
- There you go.
- Thank you.

162
00:18:51,138 --> 00:18:52,640
Not planning on staying long?

163
00:18:52,723 --> 00:18:54,934
Long as it takes to find
who we're looking for.

164
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:57,103
Maybe I can help you gents.

165
00:18:57,186 --> 00:18:59,522
I been here since Harmonville
was Fort Harmon

166
00:18:59,563 --> 00:19:01,733
and we still had soldiers
to chase off Indians.

167
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:05,444
I know everybody in town
and for miles beyond.

168
00:19:05,528 --> 00:19:09,532
Big man needing a haircut,
about 30.

169
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,867
That's his rig right there.

170
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:19,208
Oh, yeah.
Know who you're talking about.

171
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:20,918
Very friendly young fella.

172
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:23,880
Looks like he's been living out
of saddlebags most of his life.

173
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:25,923
Got his horse in the corral.

174
00:19:26,008 --> 00:19:27,426
Ride with you, does he?

175
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,261
Know where we can find him?

176
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:30,762
Yeah.

177
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:32,556
Yeah, he's up in the jailhouse.

178
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:35,726
He got into it
with some cattlemen

179
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:37,102
over at the general store.

180
00:19:37,185 --> 00:19:38,854
- Some cattlemen.
- Yeah.

181
00:19:38,937 --> 00:19:40,564
Busted them up pretty bad, too,

182
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:42,524
before Marshal Poole came up

183
00:19:42,607 --> 00:19:44,735
and hit him over the head
with his gun barrel.

184
00:19:44,776 --> 00:19:48,238
Yeah, he's lucky he
didn't get shot in the back.

185
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,323
You might want to keep that
in mind

186
00:19:50,407 --> 00:19:52,451
when you're talking
to Marshal Poole.

187
00:19:52,534 --> 00:19:54,327
Saddle his horse.

188
00:19:54,411 --> 00:19:55,704
That cover what he owes?

189
00:19:55,788 --> 00:19:56,956
Oh, yeah.

190
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,959
Name's Percy if you should need
anything else.

191
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:01,460
Much obliged.

192
00:20:01,544 --> 00:20:03,086
Hold on.

193
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:15,350
How long you had him here?

194
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:18,436
I brought him in here
yesterday afternoon.

195
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:20,938
It wasn't easy
getting him into the cell.

196
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,106
Why is that?

197
00:20:22,148 --> 00:20:24,859
Goddamn bear.
Size of it.

198
00:20:27,111 --> 00:20:30,990
Evening.
Name's Boss Spearman.

199
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:33,077
This here's Charley Waite.

200
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:34,787
Evening.

201
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:36,913
Believe you have
a friend of ours.

202
00:20:36,996 --> 00:20:40,166
Name's Mose Harrison.

203
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,210
Yeah, I got him here.

204
00:20:42,294 --> 00:20:46,298
He started a fight
in the general store.

205
00:20:46,381 --> 00:20:50,219
Mose don't start fights,
just finishes them.

206
00:20:50,302 --> 00:20:53,681
I just said he started it.
You said he didn't.

207
00:20:53,722 --> 00:20:55,182
Maybe you're calling me a liar.

208
00:20:55,224 --> 00:20:57,059
You got a charge against him?

209
00:20:57,141 --> 00:20:58,894
I got plenty.

210
00:20:58,977 --> 00:21:02,021
Inciting a fight.
Disturbing the peace.

211
00:21:02,106 --> 00:21:04,901
Creating a public nuisance.
Take your pick.

212
00:21:04,983 --> 00:21:06,860
Hear tell he got hit
over the head.

213
00:21:09,697 --> 00:21:11,156
He'll be fine.

214
00:21:11,198 --> 00:21:13,867
Well, I come to get him.

215
00:21:13,952 --> 00:21:18,707
Well, you pay the fines,
and you can have him.

216
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:23,712
How does $50 each offense sound?

217
00:21:23,752 --> 00:21:25,714
Like robbery.

218
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:30,259
Lot of money.

219
00:21:30,343 --> 00:21:33,013
Oh, yes, a lot of money.

220
00:21:33,888 --> 00:21:36,432
I been waiting for you,
Mr. Spearman.

221
00:21:36,516 --> 00:21:39,185
My name's Denton Baxter.

222
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:41,104
Be your men Mose tussled with.

223
00:21:41,187 --> 00:21:42,856
That's right.

224
00:21:42,939 --> 00:21:45,567
You know, folks
in Fort Harmon country

225
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,279
don't take to free grazers
or free grazing.

226
00:21:49,363 --> 00:21:52,449
They hate them more than they
used to hate the Indians.

227
00:21:52,532 --> 00:21:56,537
I expect by "folks,"
you mean ranchers like yourself.

228
00:21:58,371 --> 00:22:00,541
I got the biggest spread around.

229
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,710
Bigger than any three or four
put together.

230
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:04,879
Built it up with me own
two hands,

231
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,756
piece by piece,

232
00:22:06,796 --> 00:22:09,132
along with this town.

233
00:22:09,215 --> 00:22:10,885
And there ain't no
free-graze cattle

234
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:13,678
gonna take the feed
off my cattle on this range.

235
00:22:13,763 --> 00:22:15,389
Free graze is legal.

236
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,683
Times change, Mr. Spearman.

237
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:21,771
Most folks change with them.
A few holdouts never do.

238
00:22:23,897 --> 00:22:25,107
You know, a few years back,

239
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,902
a free-graze outfit
came through.

240
00:22:27,943 --> 00:22:31,030
One night,
the cattle got stampeded,

241
00:22:31,113 --> 00:22:34,325
the wagons caught on fire,
and one of those boys

242
00:22:34,408 --> 00:22:37,286
was shot off his horse
in the middle of it all.

243
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,706
Shot in the back, was he?

244
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:48,006
Your man's horse and rig
are at the livery barn.

245
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:50,592
You can take him with you
when you leave tonight.

246
00:22:50,675 --> 00:22:53,220
And come sunrise,
you hitch up your wagon

247
00:22:53,303 --> 00:22:55,389
and get your damn
free-graze cattle moving

248
00:22:55,472 --> 00:22:59,141
and keep them moving till you're
out of Fort Harmon country!

249
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:03,063
Now, you let Mr. Spearman
fetch his man

250
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:05,565
so he can be on his way.

251
00:23:24,918 --> 00:23:26,962
Charley.

252
00:23:31,675 --> 00:23:33,260
- Mose.

253
00:23:33,344 --> 00:23:35,805
Mose.

254
00:23:39,141 --> 00:23:42,770
Looks like someone's put the
boots to him after he was down.

255
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,187
Does it?

256
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,696
Mose, you gotta get up.

257
00:23:51,738 --> 00:23:56,034
Charley, I'm glad to see you.

258
00:23:57,326 --> 00:23:59,370
I don't much like this town.

259
00:24:02,165 --> 00:24:04,001
Here you go.

260
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:08,047
Boy, they really lit into him.

261
00:24:08,087 --> 00:24:09,547
You got a doctor in this town?

262
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,633
Yeah.
Doc Barlow.

263
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,178
It's the house up behind
the barn by the church.

264
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,929
Look for a picket fence.

265
00:24:16,012 --> 00:24:18,515
He's got a sign out front.

266
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:23,353
Oh, my.
Bring him right in.

267
00:24:28,525 --> 00:24:30,611
Lay him down in there.

268
00:24:40,705 --> 00:24:42,956
I'll fetch the doctor.

269
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,542
Get his legs, Boss.

270
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:47,419
Easy, easy.

271
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,798
Good.

272
00:24:57,806 --> 00:24:59,265
I'm Dr. Barlow.

273
00:24:59,349 --> 00:25:01,183
Boss Spearman.

274
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:03,520
Charley Waite.

275
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,271
Patient there's Mose Harrison.

276
00:25:05,354 --> 00:25:06,898
He works for me.

277
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:08,441
These wounds are old.

278
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:10,485
Easier to treat
if you bring him in right away.

279
00:25:10,568 --> 00:25:13,821
Your marshal had him, and he
don't keep a friendly jail.

280
00:25:13,905 --> 00:25:16,574
This is the man who was in the
fight with Dent Baxter's men?

281
00:25:16,658 --> 00:25:19,411
He certainly gave
as good as he got.

282
00:25:19,452 --> 00:25:21,579
Broke the arm of one.

283
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:24,583
Knowing them,
they had it coming, I expect.

284
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:27,127
Let's see what we got here.

285
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:28,586
- Aah!
- Easy.

286
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:30,839
- Easy, Mose.
- Easy, Mr. Harrison.

287
00:25:30,923 --> 00:25:32,841
Nobody's trying to hurt you
on purpose.

288
00:25:32,925 --> 00:25:34,927
I'd say you got a couple
of broken ribs.

289
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,930
Gonna need to get
this shirt off.

290
00:25:47,273 --> 00:25:51,193
Sue, I am gonna need some soap,
some water, and some alcohol.

291
00:25:57,908 --> 00:26:00,911
I want you to drink this,
Mr. Harrison.

292
00:26:00,995 --> 00:26:03,372
- That's it.

293
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:08,462
Let's clean up these cuts
on his face.

294
00:26:08,502 --> 00:26:11,881
He's got a nice gash
in his scalp there.

295
00:26:11,964 --> 00:26:13,216
I'd say to good health,

296
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:15,218
but then I'd probably be out
of business.

297
00:26:15,301 --> 00:26:20,014
We'll drink to good health
for them that have it coming.

298
00:26:23,351 --> 00:26:25,562
The two of you
can wait in the parlor.

299
00:26:38,825 --> 00:26:40,494
Be better he didn't travel.

300
00:26:40,576 --> 00:26:43,121
Well, he'll have to.

301
00:26:44,206 --> 00:26:46,333
How much I owe you, Doctor?

302
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:47,376
We're even.

303
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:50,504
I figured I made enough off the
damage he did to Baxter's men.

304
00:26:50,587 --> 00:26:53,048
Wish he'd have made you wealthy.

305
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:55,717
Ma'am.

306
00:27:23,788 --> 00:27:26,582
Doc Barlow's got him
a pretty wife.

307
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:28,584
Notice that, did you?

308
00:27:28,626 --> 00:27:30,378
Well, I ain't dead.

309
00:27:30,461 --> 00:27:32,004
Glad to hear it.

310
00:27:32,088 --> 00:27:33,215
Sweet, too.

311
00:27:33,256 --> 00:27:36,634
Treated us as good as anybody.
That's a real lady.

312
00:27:36,718 --> 00:27:38,512
A woman like that makes a man

313
00:27:38,594 --> 00:27:42,433
think about
setting down roots, eh?

314
00:27:43,808 --> 00:27:45,978
Doc looks like a real
hardworking feller.

315
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,565
Probably working away on making
some little ones, too.

316
00:27:49,606 --> 00:27:51,691
Creates quite a picture,
now, don't it?

317
00:27:51,775 --> 00:27:52,901
Yeah.

318
00:27:52,942 --> 00:27:55,570
Heard they're worth
a thousand words.

319
00:28:17,634 --> 00:28:19,303
Hey, Tig.

320
00:28:28,687 --> 00:28:31,066
Now, where do you suppose he is?

321
00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:49,834
Goddamn kid.

322
00:28:51,961 --> 00:28:54,005
Button's all right, Boss.

323
00:28:57,217 --> 00:29:00,470
Anyone done him harm, they'd
have gone through the wagon.

324
00:29:00,554 --> 00:29:03,473
Reckon you're right.

325
00:29:07,477 --> 00:29:09,354
Here he is.

326
00:29:10,271 --> 00:29:12,316
If you're awake,
you might want to see this.

327
00:29:12,358 --> 00:29:14,401
- Where you been?!
- I seen it before.

328
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:16,487
Out with the herd.

329
00:29:16,529 --> 00:29:18,948
I thought I told you
to stay with the wagon.

330
00:29:19,031 --> 00:29:21,117
- What happened to Mose?
- Did you hear what I said?!

331
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,369
Yeah, but what happened?

332
00:29:23,451 --> 00:29:26,831
Run into a little trouble
in that town.

333
00:29:26,872 --> 00:29:29,792
Looks like more than a little.

334
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:31,627
Are we moving on?

335
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:35,297
We always do, don't we,
once we've grazed off a place?

336
00:29:43,724 --> 00:29:45,349
Did I do something wrong?

337
00:29:45,434 --> 00:29:47,436
Just leave him be for a while.

338
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:49,854
Here.
Have some coffee.

339
00:29:49,896 --> 00:29:52,106
Made fresh, for a change.

340
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,568
There was three riders scouting
up the herd this morning.

341
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:56,861
Where?

342
00:29:56,945 --> 00:29:58,822
Maybe half a mile out.

343
00:29:58,905 --> 00:30:01,741
Just sitting there,
looking at the cattle.

344
00:30:12,127 --> 00:30:14,086
Same ones?

345
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:16,506
Four this time.

346
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,383
Country's filling up.

347
00:30:18,467 --> 00:30:20,510
Maybe we should push on.

348
00:30:20,594 --> 00:30:22,220
Do no good, Button.

349
00:30:22,304 --> 00:30:23,848
I seen them like Baxter before.

350
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:27,476
He means to have this herd
or scatter it to the wind.

351
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,394
If he was gonna take the herd,

352
00:30:29,437 --> 00:30:31,438
why not just keep you in town?

353
00:30:31,521 --> 00:30:33,900
Marshal already had Mose.

354
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,778
Wants us all in one place.

355
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,072
Far from there when it happens.

356
00:30:39,112 --> 00:30:42,784
Don't make no sense, him telling
us to move on and all.

357
00:30:42,866 --> 00:30:45,578
Weren't the only thing he said.

358
00:30:45,661 --> 00:30:48,081
Most time, a man will tell you
his bad intentions

359
00:30:48,122 --> 00:30:52,043
if you listen,
let yourself hear.

360
00:30:52,126 --> 00:30:56,214
A few years back, a free-graze
outfit come through.

361
00:30:56,297 --> 00:30:59,092
That weren't no idle story.

362
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:01,177
Let's find out for certain.

363
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,359
Beautiful country.

364
00:31:57,609 --> 00:32:00,154
A man can get lost out here,

365
00:32:00,238 --> 00:32:04,199
forget there's people and things
that ain't so simple as this.

366
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:08,747
How long we been
riding together, Charley?

367
00:32:09,706 --> 00:32:11,750
Nigh on 10 years.

368
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:13,959
Mm-hmm.

369
00:32:14,044 --> 00:32:17,422
You know what they call that,
call it a decade.

370
00:32:17,505 --> 00:32:19,758
Long time.

371
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,510
Been a lot of change since then.

372
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,347
What's on your mind, Boss?

373
00:32:27,682 --> 00:32:30,268
Way I figure it, we can leave
the cattle and run,

374
00:32:30,352 --> 00:32:32,772
or you and me can go in the dark
and stop them

375
00:32:32,854 --> 00:32:35,190
before they scatter the herd.

376
00:32:39,027 --> 00:32:43,281
You reckon them cows are worth
getting killed over?

377
00:32:43,365 --> 00:32:44,741
The cows is one thing.

378
00:32:44,825 --> 00:32:46,326
But one man telling another

379
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:50,080
where he can go in this
country's something else.

380
00:32:50,164 --> 00:32:52,082
That rancher sat
in that jailhouse,

381
00:32:52,124 --> 00:32:54,542
sneering and letting
his lawman lay down the law

382
00:32:54,585 --> 00:32:57,088
till he figured
it was time to show us

383
00:32:57,129 --> 00:32:59,465
that he gave the orders
around here.

384
00:32:59,547 --> 00:33:02,885
Ooh, sticks in my craw.

385
00:33:07,264 --> 00:33:10,226
Well, we sure as hell owe them
for what they done to Mose.

386
00:33:10,267 --> 00:33:11,560
Yeah.

387
00:33:14,105 --> 00:33:16,358
I'll saddle the horses.

388
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,906
You two keep a sharp eye out.

389
00:33:25,032 --> 00:33:28,453
Got the scatter-gun.
We'll be watching for them.

390
00:33:28,537 --> 00:33:30,831
You'll want to douse that fire.

391
00:33:30,913 --> 00:33:32,248
Button, keep to the wagon.

392
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:34,500
I don't want to see you
out in the open.

393
00:33:34,584 --> 00:33:36,085
Okay?

394
00:33:40,882 --> 00:33:43,426
I got some sugar in that town.

395
00:33:45,178 --> 00:33:47,097
It's in the wagon.

396
00:34:04,031 --> 00:34:06,158
I wouldn't want to have him
coming down on me

397
00:34:06,241 --> 00:34:07,951
like these cowboys.

398
00:34:07,994 --> 00:34:09,996
What the hell's the matter
with you, Gus?

399
00:34:10,078 --> 00:34:12,999
You're twitching all damn night.

400
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:17,879
Damn back's so sore from being
flung into that stove.

401
00:34:18,962 --> 00:34:22,800
Feel like I been humped
by a 300-pound whore.

402
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,178
Well, Gus, I'd say
you got off easy.

403
00:34:26,262 --> 00:34:28,222
Look at my face.

404
00:34:30,558 --> 00:34:34,145
Well, you can bet Butler will
square things with that big man

405
00:34:34,187 --> 00:34:36,981
for breaking his arm and all.

406
00:34:37,065 --> 00:34:39,317
Did you hear it snap?

407
00:34:40,651 --> 00:34:42,278
I heard it snap.

408
00:34:42,362 --> 00:34:44,655
Lucky for him he shoots
with either hand.

409
00:34:46,657 --> 00:34:49,327
One twitch, and you're in hell!

410
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:51,997
Now, get on your feet,
all of you!

411
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:56,834
Now, throw them guns
on the ground.

412
00:35:01,422 --> 00:35:03,467
I ain't a-gonna say it again.

413
00:35:08,972 --> 00:35:11,141
And kick them away.

414
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:21,944
Which one of you's got
a sore back?

415
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,322
Which one?

416
00:35:25,407 --> 00:35:27,366
Him.

417
00:35:28,284 --> 00:35:30,453
- You're Gus?
- Yeah.

418
00:35:30,536 --> 00:35:32,538
Ought not gang up on a man
three-to-one.

419
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,539
Ohh!

420
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:35,208
Wait a minute, mister.

421
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:38,044
- It wasn't our idea to jump him.
- Shut up, Wylie.

422
00:35:38,086 --> 00:35:40,129
Get up, you son of a bitch.

423
00:35:40,213 --> 00:35:43,466
- What's your name?
- Vince.

424
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:47,095
Mighty nice tie-down you got.
You're a gunhand, are you?

425
00:35:47,177 --> 00:35:48,805
- You fast?
- No.

426
00:35:48,887 --> 00:35:50,390
Uh-huh.

427
00:35:50,432 --> 00:35:53,601
How many riders does he have?

428
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:56,604
I said, how many riders?

429
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:59,523
The rest are on their way
to your wagon.

430
00:36:01,985 --> 00:36:04,612
Uhh! Aah!

431
00:36:04,697 --> 00:36:07,323
You want to smile now, go ahead.

432
00:36:07,407 --> 00:36:09,452
Be a while before he's of use.

433
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:13,164
Charley, throw me
them saddlebags.

434
00:36:20,629 --> 00:36:22,422
Put your spook hats on.

435
00:36:24,633 --> 00:36:26,885
The ones in your belt,
put them on.

436
00:36:30,346 --> 00:36:33,100
Now get your britches off.

437
00:36:34,185 --> 00:36:37,355
Not taking my britches off
for nobody.

438
00:36:40,274 --> 00:36:42,276
You listen out
of your good ear now.

439
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,819
Now, get them off!

440
00:36:50,659 --> 00:36:52,912
Pretty scary bunch, eh, Charley?

441
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:59,126
Get belly-down, flat-out!

442
00:36:59,168 --> 00:37:00,711
Uhh!

443
00:37:00,796 --> 00:37:02,798
Get your peckers in the dirt.

444
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:05,092
- Hyah! Hah!

445
00:37:05,174 --> 00:37:06,342
Hah!

446
00:37:07,427 --> 00:37:10,888
If I hear so much
as a twig break...

447
00:37:10,972 --> 00:37:13,892
I'll come back
and kill you all.

448
00:37:18,438 --> 00:37:20,398
Charley.

449
00:37:20,482 --> 00:37:22,150
Charley!

450
00:37:55,393 --> 00:37:57,562
No Tig come to meet us.

451
00:38:13,746 --> 00:38:17,874
Ooh.
The bastards.

452
00:38:17,957 --> 00:38:21,711
They shot the boy,
but he's alive.

453
00:38:22,628 --> 00:38:24,589
Is that Mose?

454
00:38:30,554 --> 00:38:32,055
He's dead.

455
00:38:33,056 --> 00:38:35,184
Shot him in the head.

456
00:38:41,689 --> 00:38:42,941
Charley?

457
00:38:48,154 --> 00:38:49,615
Charley?

458
00:38:52,534 --> 00:38:55,954
Charley, get the lantern
and the whiskey.

459
00:39:02,336 --> 00:39:04,421
Yeah.

460
00:39:05,881 --> 00:39:07,092
Come on, wake up.

461
00:39:07,174 --> 00:39:08,426
Charley.

462
00:39:09,427 --> 00:39:13,931
They shot him here and
cracked him in the head here.

463
00:39:14,015 --> 00:39:16,267
We'll have to dig
that bullet out.

464
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,359
You done good, Boss.

465
00:39:27,946 --> 00:39:30,907
Him going in and out like that.

466
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:34,494
I don't know.
He lost a lot of blood.

467
00:39:34,577 --> 00:39:37,288
A whack on the head
can make a man strange

468
00:39:37,372 --> 00:39:40,250
for the rest of his days.

469
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:43,211
Well, you done all you can.

470
00:39:43,294 --> 00:39:45,880
He needs a doctor now.

471
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:49,135
If Button lives through morning,

472
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:51,511
you take him in the wagon
and move on.

473
00:39:53,638 --> 00:39:56,600
You just gonna sit out here
waiting with them cows?

474
00:39:56,683 --> 00:39:58,477
That's right.

475
00:39:59,811 --> 00:40:02,314
And I'm gonna kill
every son of a bitch

476
00:40:02,356 --> 00:40:04,691
that comes to take them.

477
00:40:06,193 --> 00:40:07,611
For one man on open ground,

478
00:40:07,695 --> 00:40:10,239
you sure got a lot
of killing in mind.

479
00:40:23,461 --> 00:40:26,381
You know I never
gone against you, Boss.

480
00:40:26,464 --> 00:40:30,302
Always let you do
most of the talking.

481
00:40:30,384 --> 00:40:32,721
But he needs that doctor
back in that town,

482
00:40:32,803 --> 00:40:35,264
and I aim to take him.

483
00:40:35,347 --> 00:40:37,349
If you want to come,
we'll go together.

484
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:42,522
Otherwise, you do what you
have to do, I'll do the same.

485
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,609
You think they'll let you waltz
in there and waltz out?

486
00:40:45,692 --> 00:40:47,069
I don't figure into it.

487
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,821
Button deserves every chance
we can give him.

488
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,660
All right.

489
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:03,043
But I aim to kill Baxter
and those that done this.

490
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:06,129
And if that marshal gets in the
way, I'm gonna kill him, too.

491
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:09,883
So you best get your mind right
about what's got to be done.

492
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,054
I got no problem
with killing, Boss.

493
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,639
Never have.

494
00:42:15,868 --> 00:42:18,077
Looks real nice, Charley.

495
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,541
Yeah, a man ought to have
something to show he was here.

496
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:26,920
Be gone in another big storm.

497
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:29,548
Don't matter none.
He's got your dog for company.

498
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:33,385
He'd like it you put
old Tig with him.

499
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:35,804
Yeah, he was more
Mose's dog in the end

500
00:42:35,846 --> 00:42:37,848
than he was mine.

501
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:42,978
Be right to say some words.

502
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:45,648
You want to speak
with the man upstairs, do it.

503
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:47,817
I'll stand right here
and listen,

504
00:42:47,858 --> 00:42:50,653
but I ain't talking
to that son of a bitch.

505
00:42:50,695 --> 00:42:52,113
And I'll be holding a grudge

506
00:42:52,196 --> 00:42:57,201
for him letting this befall
a sweet kid like Mose.

507
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:06,169
Well, he sure as hell
wasn't one to complain.

508
00:43:07,545 --> 00:43:09,672
Woke with a smile.

509
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:12,342
Seemed like he could keep it
there all day.

510
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:16,221
Kind of man that'd say
"good morning" and mean it,

511
00:43:16,262 --> 00:43:18,223
whether it was or not.

512
00:43:19,516 --> 00:43:23,019
To tell you the truth, Lord,
if there was two gentler souls,

513
00:43:23,062 --> 00:43:24,854
I never seen them.

514
00:43:26,022 --> 00:43:29,527
Seemed like old Tig wouldn't
even kill birds in the end.

515
00:43:31,237 --> 00:43:34,072
Well, you got yourself
a good man and a good dog,

516
00:43:34,115 --> 00:43:35,741
and I'm inclined to agree
with Boss

517
00:43:35,825 --> 00:43:38,244
about holding a grudge
against you for it.

518
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:41,872
I guess that means "amen. "

519
00:44:05,397 --> 00:44:07,314
God.

520
00:44:07,399 --> 00:44:09,316
Charley, you all right?

521
00:44:14,865 --> 00:44:16,408
I'm fine.

522
00:44:17,617 --> 00:44:19,453
Seems like you was, you know...

523
00:44:19,535 --> 00:44:21,413
I said I'm fine.

524
00:44:23,457 --> 00:44:26,334
Just got some old feelings
coming up.

525
00:44:27,753 --> 00:44:30,338
You know, we never asked
each other much.

526
00:44:30,422 --> 00:44:34,301
That's always been okay with me.
I figured it was okay with you.

527
00:44:34,342 --> 00:44:37,512
But you said some things
the last couple of days.

528
00:44:37,596 --> 00:44:42,601
Things that seemed like they had
kind of a history to them.

529
00:44:45,938 --> 00:44:46,855
Hey, Charley?

530
00:44:46,939 --> 00:44:49,357
Don't stand behind me, Boss.

531
00:45:13,341 --> 00:45:17,095
When I was a kid, a bunch of us
would go into the woods

532
00:45:17,178 --> 00:45:19,138
with our peashooters.

533
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:22,892
Nothing fancy, just enough
to kill a bird or a squirrel,

534
00:45:22,975 --> 00:45:25,978
maybe something larger
if we was lucky.

535
00:45:27,647 --> 00:45:30,818
Killed my first man
in them woods.

536
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,406
Held the paper on our farm,
and after my pa died,

537
00:45:35,488 --> 00:45:39,326
he'd come around to get payment
from my mom in any way he could.

538
00:45:40,452 --> 00:45:44,414
Weren't much older than Button
when I shot him in the throat.

539
00:45:45,874 --> 00:45:50,045
Knew there'd be more killing, so
I run off and joined the Army.

540
00:45:50,129 --> 00:45:52,588
War was on.

541
00:45:52,673 --> 00:45:55,174
They was only too happy
to have me.

542
00:45:56,927 --> 00:46:00,013
My first skirmish was like
hunting with my friends.

543
00:46:00,055 --> 00:46:04,351
We just sat up in some trees,
and they came marching at us.

544
00:46:05,394 --> 00:46:10,315
Must have been a hundred of them
dead after the smoke cleared.

545
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,026
Went around and shot the rest
who weren't.

546
00:46:14,486 --> 00:46:17,741
Those of us with the knack
was made into a special squad

547
00:46:17,823 --> 00:46:20,285
so we could travel light
and on our own

548
00:46:20,367 --> 00:46:22,411
into enemy territory.

549
00:46:23,412 --> 00:46:28,125
Orders were pretty simple.
Make trouble wherever we could.

550
00:46:28,209 --> 00:46:32,296
With room like that, it wasn't
long before we was killing men

551
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,716
that weren't even in uniform.

552
00:46:35,758 --> 00:46:38,762
Seemed like that went on
the rest of the war.

553
00:46:40,221 --> 00:46:42,849
After that, I come West.

554
00:46:43,808 --> 00:46:47,479
Lot of call for a man
with them skills.

555
00:46:47,562 --> 00:46:51,066
And I put them to work
for men just like Baxter.

556
00:46:56,112 --> 00:46:59,158
Every once in a while,
I almost get through a day

557
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,871
without thinking
about who I am, what I'd done.

558
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:15,674
He drifted off again.

559
00:47:15,757 --> 00:47:19,303
No better, but no worse, either.

560
00:47:19,387 --> 00:47:22,390
You're a real honest man,
Charley.

561
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:24,517
Well, I ain't gonna lie
about Button.

562
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,061
Not Button I'm talking about.

563
00:47:54,381 --> 00:47:56,425
- Mr. Spearman.
- The doctor in?

564
00:47:56,508 --> 00:47:57,968
No, he's not here.

565
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:00,512
We got a boy that's hurt bad.

566
00:48:00,595 --> 00:48:03,514
Here, put him
in the examining room.

567
00:48:19,698 --> 00:48:21,325
It's not his hearing, ma'am.

568
00:48:21,366 --> 00:48:23,368
He hears real well
when he's awake.

569
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:26,580
Mr. Spearman, I'm checking
if there's blood in his ears.

570
00:48:26,664 --> 00:48:29,166
It could mean a fractured skull.

571
00:48:32,503 --> 00:48:34,337
Are you the boy's father?

572
00:48:34,422 --> 00:48:35,715
No, ma'am.

573
00:48:35,798 --> 00:48:38,384
His name's Button,
and he works for me.

574
00:48:38,468 --> 00:48:42,388
It appears that's
not very healthy.

575
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:46,350
You know the way to the parlor.
Sit down.

576
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:48,019
I'll be a while.

577
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,044
Well, I don't think
it's a fracture.

578
00:49:13,087 --> 00:49:16,423
Concussion's more likely,
but it's bad.

579
00:49:26,642 --> 00:49:29,812
I have to admit, we don't see
a lot of people shot.

580
00:49:29,895 --> 00:49:33,440
I cleaned and dressed the wound.
Doesn't look infected.

581
00:49:33,524 --> 00:49:35,151
What about the fever?

582
00:49:35,234 --> 00:49:39,238
He needs to lay still
and let his body do its work.

583
00:49:39,322 --> 00:49:41,865
No offense, ma'am,
but we come a long way

584
00:49:41,949 --> 00:49:46,161
to see that the boy gets looked
after proper by Dr. Barlow.

585
00:49:46,245 --> 00:49:47,497
Now, where's he at?

586
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:49,082
One of Dent Baxter's hands

587
00:49:49,164 --> 00:49:51,166
came and fetched him
out to the ranch.

588
00:49:51,251 --> 00:49:54,713
Some men there had an accident
night before last.

589
00:49:59,592 --> 00:50:02,762
You must tell me what happened,
Mr. Spearman.

590
00:50:04,096 --> 00:50:06,141
Baxter sent his men
to stampede the herd,

591
00:50:06,224 --> 00:50:09,060
and I figured me and Charley
to stop them.

592
00:50:09,144 --> 00:50:12,355
Surprised them where they was
hiding, and we had at them.

593
00:50:12,439 --> 00:50:16,317
Them's the one Dr. Barlow's
putting back together.

594
00:50:16,401 --> 00:50:20,655
We got back to camp, others
had shot Mose in the head,

595
00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:22,866
shot Button, left him for dead.

596
00:50:22,949 --> 00:50:23,909
Oh.

597
00:50:27,287 --> 00:50:29,330
Shot our dog.

598
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:33,836
I'll be getting money.

599
00:50:33,918 --> 00:50:36,504
It's not necessary.

600
00:50:36,589 --> 00:50:38,591
We pay our way, ma'am.

601
00:50:44,138 --> 00:50:47,016
Please, sit, Mr. Waite.

602
00:50:50,478 --> 00:50:53,355
Button.
Is that his real name?

603
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:56,692
Please, sit.

604
00:50:58,402 --> 00:51:02,114
Yeah, it's the only one
we've known.

605
00:51:04,241 --> 00:51:06,495
He's just a boy.

606
00:51:07,496 --> 00:51:09,205
Yeah.

607
00:51:09,288 --> 00:51:12,125
Picked him up in a Texas town
a few years back,

608
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:14,669
living off café garbage.

609
00:51:14,711 --> 00:51:17,213
Couldn't speak a word
of English.

610
00:51:17,255 --> 00:51:20,049
Thought we was doing him
a favor.

611
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:22,676
What about you?

612
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:24,512
Hmm?

613
00:51:24,553 --> 00:51:26,847
You know that the marshal
works for Baxter.

614
00:51:26,932 --> 00:51:29,434
People saw you ride in.

615
00:51:31,395 --> 00:51:33,397
There's payment to be made
by them that done this.

616
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,191
Don't intend to run.

617
00:51:39,069 --> 00:51:42,072
We could wire
for the federal marshal.

618
00:51:44,241 --> 00:51:47,786
If he started riding today,
he wouldn't make it for a week.

619
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:50,872
With the storm coming,
maybe longer.

620
00:51:52,332 --> 00:51:56,254
We're obliged to deal with the
marshal and Baxter ourselves.

621
00:51:56,295 --> 00:51:58,338
What about Button?

622
00:52:00,591 --> 00:52:03,469
Well, he's fighting
for his life.

623
00:52:03,552 --> 00:52:04,803
We're gonna do the same.

624
00:52:11,477 --> 00:52:16,149
Whatever's needed for Button,
you do it.

625
00:52:16,232 --> 00:52:18,943
If he wakes, he's gonna need
to stay here a couple days

626
00:52:19,026 --> 00:52:21,487
so we can watch him.

627
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:23,990
Whatever's best for him.

628
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:39,840
Can't stay away from
my little paradise, gents?!

629
00:52:39,922 --> 00:52:43,134
Believe Satan says the same at
the gates of hell, old-timer!

630
00:52:45,261 --> 00:52:48,640
We'd like to put the horses up.
Had a tough trail.

631
00:52:48,723 --> 00:52:50,392
I'd like to set
the wagon yonder.

632
00:52:50,476 --> 00:52:53,062
Help yourself!
Hurry up, though!

633
00:52:53,144 --> 00:52:55,730
I seen it like this before!

634
00:52:55,814 --> 00:52:57,858
Big one's coming!

635
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:00,235
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

636
00:54:04,092 --> 00:54:06,136
Son of a bitch.

637
00:54:13,727 --> 00:54:15,688
Sorry, Charley.

638
00:54:19,066 --> 00:54:20,276
Yeah.

639
00:54:35,916 --> 00:54:38,170
Jesus Christ.

640
00:54:42,339 --> 00:54:45,217
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo!

641
00:54:49,514 --> 00:54:52,892
Maybe you should have built it
in another spot.

642
00:54:53,685 --> 00:54:56,229
Ah, mercy.

643
00:55:13,622 --> 00:55:16,124
Get the dog!

644
00:55:16,166 --> 00:55:18,126
Get the dog!

645
00:55:19,961 --> 00:55:21,254
Get the dog!

646
00:55:22,757 --> 00:55:25,550
It's a dog there, Charley.

647
00:55:35,435 --> 00:55:37,105
Take this.

648
00:55:39,481 --> 00:55:41,526
There he is.
Back here, Charley!

649
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:43,944
To your left!
To your left!

650
00:55:43,986 --> 00:55:45,613
Get him!
Get him!

651
00:55:53,162 --> 00:55:54,789
You all right, Charley?

652
00:55:54,831 --> 00:55:58,710
Yeah, considering
I've just been swimming.

653
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,800
I owe you, mister.

654
00:56:06,676 --> 00:56:08,637
That's a sweet pup
you got there.

655
00:56:08,678 --> 00:56:11,682
Remind you of anyone, Charley?

656
00:56:11,764 --> 00:56:13,599
Small version.

657
00:56:13,684 --> 00:56:15,476
Too small to be let out
in this weather.

658
00:56:15,561 --> 00:56:17,438
Belongs to my daughter.

659
00:56:17,521 --> 00:56:21,108
I tried to grab him, but
the water was too fast for me.

660
00:56:21,734 --> 00:56:23,986
If you're going into the café,

661
00:56:24,068 --> 00:56:27,072
I'd be proud to buy you both
a cup of coffee.

662
00:56:30,408 --> 00:56:32,870
Coffee would be good about now.

663
00:56:38,709 --> 00:56:41,003
This is like the storm
that washed away Gunnison

664
00:56:41,086 --> 00:56:42,880
10, 12 years back.

665
00:56:42,963 --> 00:56:45,883
The water come down
from the mountains.

666
00:56:45,925 --> 00:56:48,636
Nowhere to go
but straight into town.

667
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:50,846
- Killed a lot of folks.
- It's okay, Bill.

668
00:56:50,888 --> 00:56:53,557
Town's been here
a long time, Mack.

669
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,268
It'll be here a lot longer.

670
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,853
That's right, Papa.

671
00:56:56,935 --> 00:56:59,397
Every once in a while,
a good storm washes through

672
00:56:59,439 --> 00:57:03,693
and leaves her as clean
as a baby's bottom.

673
00:57:03,735 --> 00:57:06,279
Got to look
on the bright side, gents.

674
00:57:17,916 --> 00:57:20,126
Marshal.

675
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:23,047
Meat and spuds, Les, as always.

676
00:57:25,715 --> 00:57:27,717
That should cover our meal.

677
00:57:29,095 --> 00:57:32,223
Worth a man's life to walk
across that road tonight.

678
00:57:32,305 --> 00:57:33,808
Thanks for the coffee.

679
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:36,309
Well, appreciate what you done.

680
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:41,189
That'll be two bits.

681
00:57:41,273 --> 00:57:42,733
Two bits.

682
00:58:04,213 --> 00:58:07,133
I'll be having words
with you two.

683
00:58:07,174 --> 00:58:10,720
And we'll be having more
than that with you, Marshal.

684
00:58:21,982 --> 00:58:25,736
No need to make
the café messy... with folks.

685
00:58:25,818 --> 00:58:28,112
I've got a warrant sworn out
for your arrest

686
00:58:28,196 --> 00:58:29,906
for assaulting Baxter's men.

687
00:58:29,989 --> 00:58:32,116
We got a warrant sworn
for attempted murder

688
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:33,660
for them that tried
to kill the boy

689
00:58:33,744 --> 00:58:36,037
who's laying over there
at the doc's.

690
00:58:36,121 --> 00:58:37,080
Swore out another one

691
00:58:37,163 --> 00:58:40,375
for them that murdered the big
fellow you had in your cell.

692
00:58:40,458 --> 00:58:42,210
Only ours ain't writ
by no tin star

693
00:58:42,294 --> 00:58:44,046
bought and paid for, Marshal.

694
00:58:44,129 --> 00:58:47,799
It's writ by us.
And we aim to enforce it.

695
00:58:47,883 --> 00:58:49,551
Is that so?

696
00:58:49,634 --> 00:58:52,846
We got no quarrel
with none of you folks.

697
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:56,475
Baxter's men bushwhacked
our friend and shot him dead.

698
00:58:56,516 --> 00:58:58,728
Shot a 16-year-old boy, too.

699
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:01,314
And clubbed him so hard...

700
00:59:02,857 --> 00:59:05,358
He might not live.

701
00:59:05,443 --> 00:59:08,196
Tried to take our cattle.

702
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:11,491
Your marshal here ain't gonna do
nothing about it.

703
00:59:12,991 --> 00:59:16,120
You don't like free grazers
in this town.

704
00:59:16,204 --> 00:59:17,746
We don't much like being here.

705
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:20,083
But a man's got a right
to protect his property

706
00:59:20,165 --> 00:59:21,667
and his life.

707
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:26,547
And we ain't letting no rancher
or his lawman take either.

708
00:59:27,882 --> 00:59:30,593
We got no intention
of harming bystanders.

709
00:59:30,676 --> 00:59:32,303
Anyone who helps or comforts

710
00:59:32,388 --> 00:59:35,473
these goddamn lawbreaking
free grazers

711
00:59:35,557 --> 00:59:38,226
is gonna have to deal with me.

712
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,200
Your call, Marshal.

713
00:59:57,745 --> 01:00:01,375
We don't have to settle this
here and now.

714
01:00:01,457 --> 01:00:04,461
You ain't going nowhere
in this weather.

715
01:00:04,545 --> 01:00:07,005
But I'll be seeing you gents
real soon.

716
01:00:07,089 --> 01:00:09,133
You can count on that.

717
01:00:21,979 --> 01:00:24,441
That marshal ain't gonna wait.

718
01:00:24,523 --> 01:00:27,777
That son of a bitch is gonna get
some men, come looking for us.

719
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:30,154
He's gonna need us locked up
tight in that jail

720
01:00:30,237 --> 01:00:32,615
by the time Baxter hits town,
'cause if we ain't,

721
01:00:32,657 --> 01:00:34,116
Baxter's gonna start to think

722
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,745
that maybe Marshal Poole ain't
worth what he's paying him.

723
01:00:37,829 --> 01:00:41,374
You got something on your mind,
just spit it out.

724
01:00:41,457 --> 01:00:44,169
Well, I say we take him
right at the jail.

725
01:00:44,252 --> 01:00:47,088
Lock him up, wait for Baxter
to come riding in.

726
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:49,924
Hell, Charley, why don't we
just ride out to Baxter's ranch

727
01:00:49,966 --> 01:00:52,552
and go straight at him, too?

728
01:00:53,969 --> 01:00:55,764
Well, I'll fight
wherever you want, Boss.

729
01:00:55,805 --> 01:00:56,973
You just make the call.

730
01:00:57,057 --> 01:00:58,641
God damn it.

731
01:00:58,725 --> 01:01:00,518
Now, hold on, Charley.
Hold on.

732
01:01:00,602 --> 01:01:03,439
Well, you asked me.
I told you.

733
01:01:08,526 --> 01:01:11,279
Charley, come on in
out of the rain, would you?

734
01:01:11,321 --> 01:01:12,989
Come on.

735
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:18,578
Come on.

736
01:01:23,834 --> 01:01:25,502
Just getting testy
in my old age.

737
01:01:25,586 --> 01:01:27,212
Sounds like it's not
such a bad idea.

738
01:01:27,296 --> 01:01:29,381
Just roll it around
is all I ask.

739
01:01:29,465 --> 01:01:31,175
All right.

740
01:01:32,718 --> 01:01:35,137
What'd you think of my speech
in there?

741
01:01:38,015 --> 01:01:40,143
Liked it.

742
01:01:40,226 --> 01:01:43,313
Maybe I ought to run
for mayor.

743
01:01:43,396 --> 01:01:45,731
Well, I believe officeholders
got to be living, Boss.

744
01:01:54,658 --> 01:01:56,617
Come to see about the boy.

745
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:00,329
He's asleep.
But, please, come in.

746
01:02:00,372 --> 01:02:02,915
Are you sure, ma'am?
We're a mite rank.

747
01:02:02,999 --> 01:02:04,500
We don't want to mess
your house.

748
01:02:04,584 --> 01:02:06,294
No, no.
No, please, it's all right.

749
01:02:06,377 --> 01:02:08,004
Come on in.

750
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,833
Thank you, ma'am.

751
01:02:45,585 --> 01:02:47,377
There you are.

752
01:03:01,434 --> 01:03:04,437
I can't get my fingers in.

753
01:03:08,441 --> 01:03:10,652
We can't get our big fat fingers
in these holes.

754
01:03:10,735 --> 01:03:13,072
- Too many broke knuckles.

755
01:03:13,154 --> 01:03:14,864
Oh, let me get you
something bigger.

756
01:03:14,948 --> 01:03:18,243
- No, ma'am, we can make do.
- No, no. It's all right.

757
01:03:18,284 --> 01:03:23,081
It's just nice to be sitting
at a table set with fine china.

758
01:03:23,165 --> 01:03:25,917
Those were my mother's.

759
01:03:26,001 --> 01:03:27,376
They were the only things
of hers

760
01:03:27,461 --> 01:03:30,088
that survived the trip
out here.

761
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:32,049
I don't know why
I bring them out.

762
01:03:32,131 --> 01:03:34,675
I can't hold them, either.

763
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,221
Guess it just makes me
feel good.

764
01:03:37,304 --> 01:03:39,848
I say what's
on my mind, good or bad.

765
01:03:39,932 --> 01:03:41,266
I admire that.

766
01:03:41,307 --> 01:03:43,811
Try living with it.

767
01:03:43,852 --> 01:03:46,105
See that?

768
01:03:46,146 --> 01:03:47,648
No need for a wife or home.

769
01:03:47,731 --> 01:03:50,442
We're just like a...
an old married couple.

770
01:03:52,027 --> 01:03:54,239
So, is it marriage
that scares you two

771
01:03:54,321 --> 01:03:56,448
- or putting down roots?
- No. Who'd have him?

772
01:03:56,490 --> 01:04:00,077
All rangy and mangy
like a rough old dog.

773
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,787
How about I hold
your head underwater

774
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:04,039
for just a little while?

775
01:04:14,425 --> 01:04:16,427
I married once.

776
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:20,305
Never knowed that,
did you, Charley?

777
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:22,809
Had a wife and child.

778
01:04:22,851 --> 01:04:24,185
Sweet little spread, too.

779
01:04:24,269 --> 01:04:28,690
It was nothing fancy,
but we was young.

780
01:04:28,774 --> 01:04:31,317
Loved each other.

781
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:33,654
Never had a cross word.

782
01:04:34,863 --> 01:04:36,406
They caught the typhus
and died.

783
01:04:36,489 --> 01:04:40,660
And after that, home didn't seem
a place to spend time.

784
01:04:40,744 --> 01:04:42,705
Believe I've changed
my mind on that

785
01:04:42,746 --> 01:04:45,790
now that I'm getting on
in years.

786
01:04:51,046 --> 01:04:55,468
If Button lives
and we survive Baxter,

787
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:59,263
I swear I aim to see to it
there's a home he's sleeping in

788
01:04:59,346 --> 01:05:02,015
instead of the cold prairie.

789
01:05:10,149 --> 01:05:12,068
Have yourself a last cup
of tea, Charley.

790
01:05:12,109 --> 01:05:14,111
I'd like to see Button again,
Miss Barlow.

791
01:05:14,195 --> 01:05:15,154
Of course.

792
01:05:15,238 --> 01:05:16,781
I know the way.

793
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:21,703
Whew.

794
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:34,633
Been riding with him 10 years.

795
01:05:34,715 --> 01:05:37,009
Never said nothing
about being married.

796
01:05:45,811 --> 01:05:48,062
Where are you and Mr. Spearman
spending the night?

797
01:05:48,146 --> 01:05:49,147
Don't rightly know.

798
01:05:49,231 --> 01:05:53,693
It... depends on circumstances.

799
01:05:53,777 --> 01:05:56,154
You mean Marshal Poole?

800
01:05:56,238 --> 01:05:58,699
We have a spare room.
It's yours if you want it.

801
01:05:58,782 --> 01:05:59,783
Couldn't do that, ma'am.

802
01:05:59,866 --> 01:06:02,786
We'd be putting you in a spot
with the marshal and Baxter.

803
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:05,998
Besides, it's a small town.

804
01:06:06,081 --> 01:06:09,752
Wouldn't look right,
particularly with the doc away.

805
01:06:28,688 --> 01:06:30,690
I'll take those.

806
01:06:31,648 --> 01:06:33,484
You know where they go?

807
01:06:33,568 --> 01:06:34,652
I saw.

808
01:06:34,736 --> 01:06:36,446
Thank you.

809
01:06:38,322 --> 01:06:41,367
Been raining like hell
ever since we got here.

810
01:06:41,451 --> 01:06:44,954
Water washing right down
Main Street.

811
01:06:45,037 --> 01:06:47,623
Charley saved a pup
from being washed away.

812
01:06:47,707 --> 01:06:49,959
Looked a little like old Tig.

813
01:06:54,547 --> 01:06:57,717
Now, if you can, you got to
listen and pay attention.

814
01:06:59,177 --> 01:07:02,764
'Cause I got something
important to say.

815
01:07:02,848 --> 01:07:07,519
I ain't been looking after you
for you to go out this way.

816
01:07:07,603 --> 01:07:10,064
The world ain't
a perfect place, Button.

817
01:07:10,147 --> 01:07:12,983
But you got
unfinished business here.

818
01:07:14,359 --> 01:07:17,279
So you come back,
you hear me, now?

819
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:20,157
You come back.

820
01:07:27,457 --> 01:07:29,334
Kind of dumb talking to him
like that.

821
01:07:29,374 --> 01:07:30,417
No.

822
01:07:30,501 --> 01:07:32,461
No, it's good.

823
01:07:34,296 --> 01:07:36,006
You all right, Mr. Spearman?

824
01:07:36,091 --> 01:07:39,426
Believe I'm as right as a man
can be under the circumstances.

825
01:07:39,511 --> 01:07:42,847
Circumstances? That's just what
Mr. Waite called them.

826
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:46,810
I asked him to reconsider,
and I'm asking you.

827
01:07:46,893 --> 01:07:50,021
By "reconsider,"
you mean tuck tail and run?

828
01:07:50,105 --> 01:07:53,066
I mean save your life and his.

829
01:07:53,107 --> 01:07:55,360
He'll listen to you.

830
01:07:55,401 --> 01:07:57,779
Charley thinks for hisself,
Miss Barlow.

831
01:07:57,862 --> 01:08:01,032
He's a good man, and he knows
what has to be done.

832
01:08:02,409 --> 01:08:05,036
I'll be paying you now
for whatever else Button needs.

833
01:08:05,078 --> 01:08:06,830
In case it goes bad
for Charley and me,

834
01:08:06,913 --> 01:08:10,959
maybe you and the doc will see
we're taken care of properly.

835
01:08:11,543 --> 01:08:14,630
I'd like to put pen to paper
if you have them.

836
01:08:14,712 --> 01:08:17,173
Yes. Of course.

837
01:09:11,855 --> 01:09:13,981
Mr. Waite?

838
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:15,983
Look at my face.

839
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:19,362
- Oh! Sorry!

840
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:23,617
I'm sorry.

841
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:26,244
It's all right, Charley.

842
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:28,455
Okay?
It just be us.

843
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:33,627
It's all right, Charley.

844
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:45,305
It's all right, Charley.

845
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:53,648
It's all right.
I'll get it.

846
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,466
Jumpy is all.

847
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:37,192
She ought not to sneak up
like that.

848
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:39,236
She weren't sneaking.

849
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:42,030
I scared that woman
half to death.

850
01:10:42,072 --> 01:10:44,157
Yeah.
Scared me a little bit, too.

851
01:10:45,826 --> 01:10:47,953
Well, that's how it is, Boss.

852
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:50,414
Ain't a pretty picture.

853
01:10:50,497 --> 01:10:52,708
Got your wits about you now?

854
01:10:53,876 --> 01:10:54,918
Yeah.

855
01:10:55,002 --> 01:10:55,919
Yeah.

856
01:10:56,003 --> 01:10:58,464
It weren't as bad as it looked.

857
01:10:58,547 --> 01:11:00,383
I'll bet.

858
01:11:11,478 --> 01:11:14,064
Go! Hyah!

859
01:11:39,547 --> 01:11:41,758
Two whiskeys, barkeep.

860
01:11:49,308 --> 01:11:52,603
Barkeep!
Two whiskeys.

861
01:11:55,814 --> 01:11:57,942
You see that sign?

862
01:11:57,982 --> 01:12:01,612
Around these parts,
free grazers is the first.

863
01:12:19,004 --> 01:12:21,715
Now, he asked you twice.

864
01:12:21,799 --> 01:12:23,968
Ain't gonna ask again.

865
01:12:26,512 --> 01:12:29,557
Hey, Bill, it's all right.

866
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,642
These are the fellows
that saved my dog.

867
01:12:31,726 --> 01:12:34,979
I couldn't serve them
if they saved Jesus himself.

868
01:12:35,021 --> 01:12:36,940
Mr. Baxter would have my job.

869
01:12:37,022 --> 01:12:37,982
Baxter the owner?

870
01:12:38,066 --> 01:12:39,400
That's right.

871
01:12:39,484 --> 01:12:41,318
Give me a bottle.
I'll serve them myself.

872
01:12:41,361 --> 01:12:42,862
You know I can't do that.

873
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:56,835
Now we'll have our drinks.

874
01:13:12,934 --> 01:13:14,896
Believe I'll have me another.

875
01:13:17,231 --> 01:13:19,316
Yes.

876
01:13:24,863 --> 01:13:28,784
Well, looks like the rain's
let up a bit.

877
01:13:28,868 --> 01:13:29,702
Well, if it don't,

878
01:13:29,785 --> 01:13:32,288
there'll be trout fishing
right on Main Street.

879
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:37,959
I'd like you to meet my boys.

880
01:13:38,044 --> 01:13:39,544
Ray and Cory.

881
01:13:40,608 --> 01:13:42,985
We run a freight outfit
when the weather cooperates.

882
01:13:43,069 --> 01:13:44,112
Boss Spearman.

883
01:13:44,195 --> 01:13:47,824
And the marksman here
is Charley Waite.

884
01:13:47,906 --> 01:13:51,452
Is all that true,
what you said in the café?

885
01:13:51,535 --> 01:13:52,703
Yeah.

886
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:55,496
There's a kid at the doc's house

887
01:13:55,581 --> 01:13:57,916
put on death's doorstep
by Baxter.

888
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,209
Doc's wife's caring for him

889
01:13:59,293 --> 01:14:01,211
until he comes back
after the storm.

890
01:14:01,294 --> 01:14:02,420
Doc's wife?

891
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:04,213
Yeah.
Miss Barlow.

892
01:14:04,297 --> 01:14:05,673
You mean Sue?

893
01:14:05,756 --> 01:14:07,134
That's right.

894
01:14:07,216 --> 01:14:09,593
Well, she'd make somebody
a fine wife.

895
01:14:09,635 --> 01:14:12,929
But she ain't the doc's.

896
01:14:13,014 --> 01:14:14,806
That's his sister.

897
01:14:14,891 --> 01:14:16,224
His sister?

898
01:14:16,309 --> 01:14:18,935
Ain't his wife.

899
01:14:21,855 --> 01:14:23,607
Good evening, Mack.

900
01:14:23,689 --> 01:14:24,608
Ralph.

901
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:25,734
Ray, Cory.

902
01:14:25,817 --> 01:14:27,610
Whiskey.

903
01:14:27,652 --> 01:14:29,862
This is Ralph Peterson.
He runs the general store.

904
01:14:29,946 --> 01:14:32,448
That's where I was
when the dog got free.

905
01:14:32,531 --> 01:14:35,493
You fellers the free grazers,
I expect.

906
01:14:43,334 --> 01:14:44,502
No offense.

907
01:14:44,584 --> 01:14:46,670
Personally, I don't stand
with others around here

908
01:14:46,753 --> 01:14:48,630
about free grazers.

909
01:14:48,713 --> 01:14:53,259
There was a fight in your store
about a week or so back.

910
01:14:53,342 --> 01:14:55,678
Some of Baxter's men
jumped our friend.

911
01:14:55,761 --> 01:14:56,721
He was a big feller.

912
01:14:56,803 --> 01:14:58,639
Yeah.
I saw the whole thing.

913
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:01,059
That big feller drubbed the hell
out of them other three.

914
01:15:01,141 --> 01:15:03,519
Broke one's arm.

915
01:15:03,602 --> 01:15:06,021
Be a gunhand named Butler,
would it?

916
01:15:06,103 --> 01:15:08,065
That's what they say.

917
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:12,236
Felt bad about your friend.
Is he all right?

918
01:15:13,945 --> 01:15:15,613
He's dead.

919
01:15:19,075 --> 01:15:20,409
That's too bad.

920
01:15:20,492 --> 01:15:21,994
Seemed like
a nice young feller.

921
01:15:22,077 --> 01:15:25,331
It's a shame what this town
has come to.

922
01:15:25,413 --> 01:15:27,916
You could do something
about it.

923
01:15:30,043 --> 01:15:32,127
What?

924
01:15:32,212 --> 01:15:33,463
We're freighters.

925
01:15:33,505 --> 01:15:36,508
Ralph here's a shopkeeper.

926
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:39,135
You're men, ain't you?

927
01:15:39,176 --> 01:15:43,848
I didn't raise my boys
just to see them killed.

928
01:15:45,099 --> 01:15:46,349
Well, you may not know this,

929
01:15:46,433 --> 01:15:51,355
but there's things that gnaw
on a man worse than dying.

930
01:16:15,627 --> 01:16:16,670
Hey!

931
01:16:19,714 --> 01:16:21,048
Evening, gents.

932
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:22,550
Evening.

933
01:16:22,633 --> 01:16:23,926
Better get out of this weather,

934
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:26,220
or your bones are gonna be
even stiffer than mine.

935
01:16:26,304 --> 01:16:28,848
Heading into the saloon
to do just that.

936
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:30,308
Come looking for you boys.

937
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:32,517
I'd have bought you a drink
if you was earlier.

938
01:16:32,602 --> 01:16:34,937
Then turn around
and do it now.

939
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:38,689
Marshal's got men waiting to
waylay you back at the livery.

940
01:16:38,732 --> 01:16:40,149
Another one's in your wagon.

941
01:16:40,233 --> 01:16:42,986
And then there's another
in the shed across from it.

942
01:16:43,069 --> 01:16:44,028
Marshal with them?

943
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:45,530
No.

944
01:16:45,572 --> 01:16:47,698
He's sitting up there
all by his lonesome

945
01:16:47,741 --> 01:16:49,950
in that warm, dry jailhouse
with his feet up

946
01:16:50,035 --> 01:16:52,161
waiting for them
to bring you in.

947
01:16:52,244 --> 01:16:54,078
Or kill you.

948
01:16:54,121 --> 01:16:55,706
Well, thanks for the warning.

949
01:16:55,789 --> 01:17:00,043
Like I told you, never been
partial to the marshal's ways.

950
01:17:00,085 --> 01:17:01,920
Dent Baxter's either.

951
01:17:02,003 --> 01:17:04,547
You're near the only friend
we got in this town.

952
01:17:04,589 --> 01:17:06,882
I'll be buying a drink or two.

953
01:17:06,925 --> 01:17:09,760
You keep it quiet, all right?

954
01:17:13,847 --> 01:17:16,183
Time's come.
How you want to play it?

955
01:17:16,266 --> 01:17:19,102
Well, I work for you, Boss.
I'll play it however you want.

956
01:17:19,186 --> 01:17:21,687
Nobody works for anybody here,
Charley.

957
01:17:22,481 --> 01:17:25,067
Now, the name Butler mean
anything to you?

958
01:17:25,108 --> 01:17:27,610
You hear names when you're on
the other side of things.

959
01:17:27,652 --> 01:17:30,112
He as fast as they say?

960
01:17:30,196 --> 01:17:31,322
He's a killer.

961
01:17:31,405 --> 01:17:33,074
Know him if you saw him?

962
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:34,450
He ain't hard to recognize

963
01:17:34,491 --> 01:17:36,452
if you know
what you're looking for.

964
01:17:36,493 --> 01:17:37,953
Yeah.

965
01:17:37,995 --> 01:17:39,663
Too bad if we get
shot up tonight

966
01:17:39,747 --> 01:17:41,706
before we get a chance
at him and Baxter.

967
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:43,668
Sure as hell is.

968
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:45,627
Tell you what,
I'd like to sit someplace dry

969
01:17:45,669 --> 01:17:48,712
while the marshal's men
sit out in this rain.

970
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:51,424
Won't be so steady
come morning.

971
01:17:51,465 --> 01:17:52,259
Small town.

972
01:17:52,299 --> 01:17:56,596
It's hard to hide even at night
in this weather.

973
01:17:56,637 --> 01:17:59,057
What do you want to do?

974
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:00,391
Yep.

975
01:18:00,474 --> 01:18:03,226
Heard me an idea
sounded pretty good.

976
01:18:04,353 --> 01:18:06,312
You did, did you?

977
01:18:09,233 --> 01:18:11,067
Well, all right.

978
01:18:26,165 --> 01:18:27,416
He's alone.

979
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:30,544
Get your hands up.

980
01:18:30,627 --> 01:18:32,629
You must be plumb crazy.

981
01:18:32,712 --> 01:18:34,213
Shut up.

982
01:18:47,018 --> 01:18:49,102
You're dead men.

983
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:53,398
Didn't he tell you to shut up?

984
01:18:57,694 --> 01:18:58,820
What's that?

985
01:18:58,862 --> 01:19:02,198
Chloroform.
Stole it from the doc's.

986
01:19:04,867 --> 01:19:07,036
You gonna arrest me
for that, Marshal?

987
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,251
Jesus.

988
01:19:55,288 --> 01:19:57,290
Well, looky here.

989
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:59,167
He's asleep.

990
01:19:59,252 --> 01:20:00,961
No.

991
01:20:02,129 --> 01:20:03,755
Looky here.

992
01:20:04,798 --> 01:20:06,757
Put 'em down.

993
01:20:10,428 --> 01:20:11,929
This way.

994
01:20:24,482 --> 01:20:26,401
What do you think?
Do you like it?

995
01:20:27,777 --> 01:20:29,696
You like it,
you son of a buck, you?

996
01:20:29,779 --> 01:20:31,613
- Huh?

997
01:20:31,698 --> 01:20:34,366
A little bit more?
A bit more?

998
01:20:34,451 --> 01:20:35,659
A bit more.

999
01:20:39,538 --> 01:20:42,791
Wasn't no call to leave me
setting out like that.

1000
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:46,336
- There wasn't a lot of time.
- I ain't bait, Charley.

1001
01:20:50,631 --> 01:20:52,301
I hear you.

1002
01:20:52,341 --> 01:20:54,135
Best you remember it.

1003
01:20:54,178 --> 01:20:57,430
Well, I guess you ain't gonna
let me forget, are you?

1004
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:01,975
Starting to enjoy that part,
aren't you?

1005
01:21:08,482 --> 01:21:09,608
Sorry if we woke you.

1006
01:21:09,649 --> 01:21:11,109
No, no.
You didn't.

1007
01:21:11,150 --> 01:21:14,154
- Come to see if...
- Go see for yourself.

1008
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:19,658
Hey.

1009
01:21:20,619 --> 01:21:22,369
- Hey, Boss.
- Hey.

1010
01:21:22,453 --> 01:21:24,121
You gave us a fright, pard.

1011
01:21:24,163 --> 01:21:26,749
Thought we was gonna lose you.

1012
01:21:26,831 --> 01:21:29,543
Just taking a little nap,
that's all.

1013
01:21:29,627 --> 01:21:31,503
It's good to have you back.

1014
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:33,963
We owe you, Miss Barlow,
and we thank you.

1015
01:21:34,006 --> 01:21:35,799
You best thank God instead.

1016
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:40,178
Yes, ma'am.
We'll... give that a try.

1017
01:21:40,219 --> 01:21:42,430
Well, I expect you men
are hungry.

1018
01:21:42,513 --> 01:21:43,598
Button just ate.

1019
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:46,266
I thought I'd make myself
some breakfast.

1020
01:21:46,351 --> 01:21:49,186
Two more mouths wouldn't be
any bother.

1021
01:21:49,269 --> 01:21:52,022
I'm just gonna change.

1022
01:21:52,105 --> 01:21:55,024
You.
You should try to sleep.

1023
01:21:55,108 --> 01:21:57,236
He will.

1024
01:21:57,318 --> 01:21:59,946
Now, you do as she says now.

1025
01:22:00,030 --> 01:22:01,697
Yes, Boss.

1026
01:22:01,781 --> 01:22:03,574
Okay.

1027
01:22:05,243 --> 01:22:06,536
Boss?

1028
01:22:06,577 --> 01:22:07,828
Yeah?

1029
01:22:08,829 --> 01:22:10,539
Mose?

1030
01:22:10,623 --> 01:22:13,041
I'll be along in a minute,
Charley.

1031
01:22:13,084 --> 01:22:15,669
Be seeing you, Button.

1032
01:22:41,277 --> 01:22:42,986
Aah.

1033
01:24:18,241 --> 01:24:20,576
If you don't mind my saying,
ma'am, you look...

1034
01:24:22,662 --> 01:24:23,913
Tired.

1035
01:24:23,995 --> 01:24:27,624
Oh.
It's been a long night.

1036
01:24:27,667 --> 01:24:29,709
Why don't you sit?

1037
01:24:32,004 --> 01:24:34,464
Let an old cowpoke cook up
some breakfast.

1038
01:24:34,548 --> 01:24:37,384
No, I couldn't let you.

1039
01:24:37,467 --> 01:24:39,010
Sure, you could.

1040
01:24:41,596 --> 01:24:43,597
Thank you.

1041
01:24:46,101 --> 01:24:50,187
I want to apologize
for earlier.

1042
01:24:50,270 --> 01:24:51,772
Oh, no, no.
There's no need.

1043
01:24:51,855 --> 01:24:53,107
You were startled.

1044
01:24:53,189 --> 01:24:56,651
No, it was more than that.

1045
01:24:58,361 --> 01:25:00,697
I've been trying to put
some bad times behind me.

1046
01:25:00,738 --> 01:25:04,366
But sometimes
they don't stay put.

1047
01:25:05,869 --> 01:25:08,329
Always makes me feel better
to let things breathe a little.

1048
01:25:08,412 --> 01:25:09,830
Not bury them.

1049
01:25:09,872 --> 01:25:13,208
I'm learning that.
Trying, anyway.

1050
01:25:13,292 --> 01:25:16,211
Well, that's all
any of us can do.

1051
01:25:16,294 --> 01:25:19,298
Just glad Button's
getting better.

1052
01:25:20,089 --> 01:25:23,676
Don't believe I've ever seen
Boss so worried.

1053
01:25:23,761 --> 01:25:25,720
Well, the doctor will be
on his way home

1054
01:25:25,803 --> 01:25:28,805
as soon as the storm's passed.

1055
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:31,893
By the doctor,
you mean your brother?

1056
01:25:35,271 --> 01:25:39,065
It's just we've been thinking
that you and the doc was...

1057
01:25:39,150 --> 01:25:41,401
husband and wife.

1058
01:25:41,485 --> 01:25:42,944
Oh.

1059
01:25:43,903 --> 01:25:46,238
You did?

1060
01:25:46,281 --> 01:25:49,575
Didn't find out
till last night.

1061
01:25:49,618 --> 01:25:52,161
Thought you was married, Sue.

1062
01:25:52,244 --> 01:25:54,539
Why, no.
I'm...

1063
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:56,916
I'm not, Charley.

1064
01:25:58,583 --> 01:26:02,421
Well, that's good.
I mean that's good to know.

1065
01:26:02,504 --> 01:26:05,215
Otherwise,
we'd been thinking wrong.

1066
01:26:05,256 --> 01:26:06,674
We wouldn't want to do that.

1067
01:26:06,759 --> 01:26:10,095
No.
No, of course not.

1068
01:26:30,614 --> 01:26:32,532
Much obliged to you, ma'am.

1069
01:26:32,616 --> 01:26:35,284
You're very welcome,
Mr. Spearman.

1070
01:26:37,578 --> 01:26:39,288
Thank you, Sue.

1071
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:43,084
Take care of yourself,
Charley.

1072
01:26:54,553 --> 01:26:58,223
Are you just gonna go off like
that without saying nothing?

1073
01:26:58,305 --> 01:26:59,598
Ain't nothing to say.

1074
01:26:59,641 --> 01:27:02,476
I seen how you look at that gal
and the way she looks at you.

1075
01:27:02,518 --> 01:27:04,437
It ain't right to walk away
without a word.

1076
01:27:04,478 --> 01:27:07,481
What do you want me
to tell her, Boss?

1077
01:27:07,523 --> 01:27:09,607
We probably ain't gonna make it?

1078
01:27:09,692 --> 01:27:12,819
Be a big fat comfort.

1079
01:27:14,571 --> 01:27:16,823
I don't know what you should
tell her, Charley.

1080
01:27:16,906 --> 01:27:20,701
I wish I'd have said more
to my wife before she passed.

1081
01:27:20,785 --> 01:27:23,663
This may be the last time she
sees you in this world, Charley.

1082
01:27:23,704 --> 01:27:24,789
Or you her.

1083
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:26,331
So tell her whatever you can.

1084
01:27:26,416 --> 01:27:28,834
'Cause she's entitled to more
than just your backside

1085
01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:31,462
walking away.

1086
01:27:37,633 --> 01:27:39,010
Charley.

1087
01:27:40,595 --> 01:27:45,600
I'm not sure
what's worth saying or not.

1088
01:27:45,682 --> 01:27:47,518
Well, you don't have to
say anything.

1089
01:27:47,602 --> 01:27:49,770
Yeah, I do.

1090
01:27:49,853 --> 01:27:52,314
Boss is right about that.

1091
01:27:52,398 --> 01:27:55,192
He's right
about a lot of things.

1092
01:27:55,275 --> 01:27:56,777
It's just...

1093
01:28:01,615 --> 01:28:03,240
I'm not who you think
I am, Sue.

1094
01:28:03,325 --> 01:28:06,118
I've... been places.
I've done things.

1095
01:28:06,203 --> 01:28:08,538
Most of them, I'm not proud of.

1096
01:28:09,705 --> 01:28:14,167
You know, I always hoped
somebody gentle and caring

1097
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:16,211
might come along.

1098
01:28:18,714 --> 01:28:22,051
Years pass.
A small town and all.

1099
01:28:22,092 --> 01:28:26,304
And your hopes begin to fade
a little every day

1100
01:28:26,387 --> 01:28:29,973
until you hardly remember
what they were.

1101
01:28:30,058 --> 01:28:32,352
I've seen who you are, Charley.

1102
01:28:32,393 --> 01:28:34,812
The way you looked after
that boy

1103
01:28:34,895 --> 01:28:37,523
and the respect you give Boss.

1104
01:28:37,606 --> 01:28:38,774
It might be little bits.

1105
01:28:38,857 --> 01:28:42,944
But they're enough
for a woman who looks.

1106
01:28:46,405 --> 01:28:48,741
Men are gonna get killed
here today, Sue.

1107
01:28:48,784 --> 01:28:50,785
And I'm gonna kill them.

1108
01:28:50,868 --> 01:28:52,787
You understand that?

1109
01:28:53,703 --> 01:28:55,415
Yes.

1110
01:28:58,126 --> 01:29:00,210
I want you to have this.

1111
01:29:00,294 --> 01:29:02,629
It's always brought me luck.

1112
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:07,216
I... can't take your locket.

1113
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:11,262
It's not your choice
when it's a gift.

1114
01:29:11,971 --> 01:29:14,014
It's a good likeness of you.

1115
01:29:15,057 --> 01:29:17,935
It's my mother
when she was young.

1116
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:22,565
She's beautiful.

1117
01:29:27,485 --> 01:29:31,614
I want you to know that
if I don't ever see you again

1118
01:29:31,698 --> 01:29:34,743
that I meant everything
I said to you

1119
01:29:34,784 --> 01:29:38,913
and I appreciate everything
you said to me.

1120
01:29:38,996 --> 01:29:42,332
Ain't nothing that happened in
this old town been a surprise.

1121
01:29:42,417 --> 01:29:44,793
Except you.

1122
01:29:56,346 --> 01:29:59,015
I'll be seeing you,
Charley Waite.

1123
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:15,238
Happy?

1124
01:30:15,322 --> 01:30:17,783
Yeah.
If you are.

1125
01:30:41,095 --> 01:30:43,348
Morning, boys.

1126
01:30:45,891 --> 01:30:47,476
Brung you breakfast.

1127
01:30:49,854 --> 01:30:52,022
Hey, you kids.
Come away from there.

1128
01:30:52,106 --> 01:30:53,857
Come on.

1129
01:30:53,899 --> 01:30:55,317
You get along.

1130
01:31:07,286 --> 01:31:09,914
What do you suppose
this looks like?

1131
01:31:09,996 --> 01:31:12,125
It don't matter.

1132
01:31:12,208 --> 01:31:14,626
Whole town knows
there's a fight coming.

1133
01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:16,879
They just hope it don't
spill over to them.

1134
01:31:29,557 --> 01:31:32,351
Well, if I'm gonna get killed,

1135
01:31:32,393 --> 01:31:36,355
I got a hankering to soothe
my sweet tooth.

1136
01:31:41,067 --> 01:31:42,652
Morning.

1137
01:31:43,278 --> 01:31:45,363
Morning.

1138
01:31:47,907 --> 01:31:50,368
What can I do for you fellers?

1139
01:31:50,409 --> 01:31:53,246
Thinking about some candy.

1140
01:31:53,329 --> 01:31:55,248
- Candy?
- Yeah.

1141
01:31:55,914 --> 01:31:58,208
Yes, sir.
Candy.

1142
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:59,793
Got anything you want.

1143
01:31:59,878 --> 01:32:02,254
- Got jawbreakers.
- Yeah.

1144
01:32:02,337 --> 01:32:07,383
Gumdrops, candy canes,
licorice, caramel, honey crisp.

1145
01:32:07,426 --> 01:32:10,094
Jujubes, lollipops,
milk chocolate...

1146
01:32:10,178 --> 01:32:11,763
Looking for something special.

1147
01:32:11,846 --> 01:32:14,891
Now, what's the most expensive
you've got?

1148
01:32:16,350 --> 01:32:17,810
Well...

1149
01:32:17,894 --> 01:32:20,604
Ooh.
I got just the thing.

1150
01:32:29,738 --> 01:32:31,865
- This is dark chocolate.
- Yeah.

1151
01:32:31,947 --> 01:32:34,867
It comes all the way
from Switzerland, Europe.

1152
01:32:34,951 --> 01:32:37,286
That's near France, see.

1153
01:32:37,370 --> 01:32:39,330
They call it bittersweet.

1154
01:32:39,414 --> 01:32:41,415
Melts in your mouth.

1155
01:32:41,457 --> 01:32:43,584
- You tried it?
- No.

1156
01:32:43,626 --> 01:32:45,961
How do you know
it melts in your mouth?

1157
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:52,801
Well, truth is
we can't afford it ourselves.

1158
01:32:52,842 --> 01:32:55,845
Mm-hmm.
I'll take two.

1159
01:32:55,929 --> 01:32:57,389
Don't you want to know how much?

1160
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:59,057
Nope.

1161
01:32:59,139 --> 01:33:00,517
Yes, sir.

1162
01:33:01,393 --> 01:33:04,437
And three of your finest cigars.

1163
01:33:04,478 --> 01:33:08,649
My friend and me got a hankering
for Switzerland chocolate

1164
01:33:08,732 --> 01:33:10,776
and a good smoke.

1165
01:33:18,449 --> 01:33:22,036
Now, these come all the way
from Havana, Cuba.

1166
01:33:22,121 --> 01:33:24,122
Thank you.

1167
01:33:24,205 --> 01:33:26,666
- Anything else?
- No. That'll do it.

1168
01:33:26,707 --> 01:33:28,792
How much I owe you?

1169
01:33:28,835 --> 01:33:31,211
It's... $5.

1170
01:33:35,549 --> 01:33:37,134
Charley.

1171
01:33:37,217 --> 01:33:39,511
Here you are.

1172
01:33:39,553 --> 01:33:41,346
Believe I'll enjoy
these later, Boss.

1173
01:33:41,429 --> 01:33:42,722
Yep.

1174
01:33:44,683 --> 01:33:46,685
You ought to do yourselves
a favor and ride on

1175
01:33:46,726 --> 01:33:49,019
while you still got time.

1176
01:33:49,061 --> 01:33:51,312
Tried minding
our own business.

1177
01:33:54,357 --> 01:33:55,817
This is good.

1178
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:57,862
Worth every penny.

1179
01:34:01,906 --> 01:34:04,200
You're gonna
get yourselves killed.

1180
01:34:04,242 --> 01:34:05,701
Try that, Ralph.

1181
01:34:05,744 --> 01:34:07,412
Go on.

1182
01:34:10,373 --> 01:34:11,915
Sitting right here
in front of you.

1183
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,877
Never even tried it.

1184
01:34:15,210 --> 01:34:20,049
Shame to go forever without
taking a taste of something.

1185
01:34:26,137 --> 01:34:29,099
Charley, let's go.

1186
01:34:32,602 --> 01:34:33,811
Percy!

1187
01:34:33,894 --> 01:34:35,521
Up here!

1188
01:34:35,563 --> 01:34:38,065
Brought you a cigar.
All the way from Havana, Cuba.

1189
01:34:38,149 --> 01:34:39,399
You don't say?

1190
01:34:39,483 --> 01:34:41,443
I've heard about them,
but I never had one.

1191
01:34:41,526 --> 01:34:43,737
Much obliged to you.

1192
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:45,072
What do you think?

1193
01:34:45,113 --> 01:34:47,949
Better than them crappers
I usually smoke.

1194
01:34:48,033 --> 01:34:49,785
So, you're gonna make
your stand down here?

1195
01:34:49,867 --> 01:34:52,286
Yeah.
But out there around our wagon.

1196
01:34:52,370 --> 01:34:56,373
Not much choice without getting
a lot of innocent folks shot up.

1197
01:34:56,415 --> 01:34:58,168
Like to place some guns and ammo

1198
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:00,002
where we can get to it
on a short run.

1199
01:35:00,086 --> 01:35:01,462
Help yourself.

1200
01:35:01,545 --> 01:35:03,547
We'll try to stay
out of your barn.

1201
01:35:03,631 --> 01:35:05,216
Might not be able to.

1202
01:35:05,256 --> 01:35:07,592
Best bring in your livestock.

1203
01:35:08,301 --> 01:35:09,719
Be wishing you good luck now.

1204
01:35:09,761 --> 01:35:11,262
Thank you.

1205
01:35:31,323 --> 01:35:33,991
It's a pretty day
for making things right.

1206
01:35:34,076 --> 01:35:35,326
Well, enjoy it.

1207
01:35:35,411 --> 01:35:36,953
Because once it starts,

1208
01:35:37,036 --> 01:35:39,372
it's gonna be messy
like nothing you ever seen.

1209
01:35:39,455 --> 01:35:40,790
I ain't survived my years

1210
01:35:40,872 --> 01:35:43,167
without being in
some fights, Charley.

1211
01:35:45,253 --> 01:35:47,212
I ain't doubting
your grit, Boss.

1212
01:35:47,296 --> 01:35:48,923
You got more than any man
I ever known.

1213
01:35:49,005 --> 01:35:51,383
It's just that...

1214
01:35:51,466 --> 01:35:52,801
I don't mean to be hard.

1215
01:35:52,843 --> 01:35:54,469
It's just the other night,
them fellows

1216
01:35:54,553 --> 01:35:56,304
back in them trees we let go.

1217
01:35:56,388 --> 01:35:58,305
It was my call, Charley.

1218
01:35:58,348 --> 01:36:00,307
I can see now
it was probably a mistake.

1219
01:36:00,392 --> 01:36:03,602
It's not what I meant.
I mean, maybe it was.

1220
01:36:03,644 --> 01:36:06,772
But the fact is it's what I
always respected about you.

1221
01:36:06,856 --> 01:36:09,941
What I always appreciated.

1222
01:36:10,025 --> 01:36:14,196
How you treated other people
and how you treated me.

1223
01:36:14,279 --> 01:36:17,157
How you never look
for no trouble.

1224
01:36:17,198 --> 01:36:20,243
That kept me from trouble.

1225
01:36:20,326 --> 01:36:21,745
But it's found us here, Boss.

1226
01:36:21,828 --> 01:36:24,789
And if we're to have
any chance, you'll...

1227
01:36:24,831 --> 01:36:28,168
You go on and talk, Charley.
I'll hear you.

1228
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:29,501
I'm almost certain

1229
01:36:29,586 --> 01:36:32,671
they'll be overly confident
in their numbers.

1230
01:36:32,755 --> 01:36:35,549
Especially if we're standing
right out here in front of them.

1231
01:36:35,632 --> 01:36:37,217
It's not like we'll have
any advantage.

1232
01:36:37,301 --> 01:36:39,260
But if they're out there
with us,

1233
01:36:39,344 --> 01:36:42,556
then they won't have as much
as they might have otherwise.

1234
01:36:42,638 --> 01:36:44,766
I don't figure all of them
to be killers.

1235
01:36:44,850 --> 01:36:47,810
Only two or three like Butler
will have done much of it.

1236
01:36:47,852 --> 01:36:49,895
I'll be looking to him.

1237
01:36:50,938 --> 01:36:53,983
The others will be hired men.
Probably saddle tramps.

1238
01:36:54,025 --> 01:36:56,443
Maybe ex-Army.

1239
01:36:56,526 --> 01:36:58,153
The rest will be cowpunchers.

1240
01:36:58,195 --> 01:37:01,031
They won't want to line up
in front of us.

1241
01:37:02,157 --> 01:37:03,991
It'll happen fast
once I start.

1242
01:37:04,034 --> 01:37:07,245
So just keep yourself
moving forward.

1243
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:11,082
And they'll either move or root.
Maybe even freeze up.

1244
01:37:11,166 --> 01:37:13,250
It don't matter which.

1245
01:37:13,334 --> 01:37:16,087
You just start right in on them
with that scatter-gun.

1246
01:37:16,170 --> 01:37:19,839
When you've done both barrels,
drop it, pull your pistol,

1247
01:37:19,882 --> 01:37:23,009
and make a run for that building
where we stashed them others.

1248
01:37:23,052 --> 01:37:25,011
I'll be trying to do the same
if I can.

1249
01:37:25,053 --> 01:37:26,388
Right.

1250
01:37:26,471 --> 01:37:29,891
Sounds like you got it
all worked out.

1251
01:37:29,933 --> 01:37:31,101
Yeah.

1252
01:37:31,184 --> 01:37:33,561
Except the part
where we don't get killed.

1253
01:37:34,812 --> 01:37:38,690
Best smoke these
while we got the chance.

1254
01:37:38,732 --> 01:37:40,734
Yeah.

1255
01:38:05,882 --> 01:38:10,053
I'm thinking about getting out
of the damn cattle business.

1256
01:38:12,973 --> 01:38:15,225
You never said nothing
except nag me and Button

1257
01:38:15,267 --> 01:38:17,351
about getting ourselves out.

1258
01:38:17,436 --> 01:38:20,021
Well, maybe my own words
struck a chord.

1259
01:38:20,104 --> 01:38:23,023
Thought maybe
I'd sell off the cattle

1260
01:38:23,107 --> 01:38:27,402
and have enough to start up
a saloon somewhere.

1261
01:38:27,445 --> 01:38:30,030
Man could stay cool
in the summer

1262
01:38:30,113 --> 01:38:32,032
and dry in the winter.

1263
01:38:34,534 --> 01:38:38,454
Some dancing girls might be
nice, you know?

1264
01:38:38,496 --> 01:38:40,456
Have to get me some.

1265
01:38:43,208 --> 01:38:44,793
Yeah.

1266
01:38:49,715 --> 01:38:54,762
"If I die,
please sell my good horse

1267
01:38:54,803 --> 01:38:58,014
and my good saddle and my guns

1268
01:38:58,098 --> 01:39:03,227
to buy a tea set
for Miss Barlow. "

1269
01:39:03,978 --> 01:39:06,189
"Charley Waite. "

1270
01:39:09,734 --> 01:39:11,652
"Postscript...

1271
01:39:11,693 --> 01:39:14,154
I like this one.

1272
01:39:14,238 --> 01:39:16,239
But I don't know. "

1273
01:39:17,157 --> 01:39:19,618
"Princess pattern. "

1274
01:39:23,663 --> 01:39:24,789
Oh, hell.

1275
01:39:24,873 --> 01:39:26,750
What's the matter?

1276
01:39:28,918 --> 01:39:31,712
Oh.
Looks like you waited too long.

1277
01:39:31,795 --> 01:39:34,964
Kind of like us
and free grazing.

1278
01:39:35,049 --> 01:39:37,967
Well, good is good.

1279
01:39:38,052 --> 01:39:39,844
Melted or not.

1280
01:39:49,353 --> 01:39:53,316
Looks like you're plumb chained,
to your work, Marshal.

1281
01:39:53,357 --> 01:39:54,817
Get up, Poole.

1282
01:39:54,858 --> 01:39:57,194
He ain't worth a damn.

1283
01:39:57,277 --> 01:39:59,196
Get them all up!

1284
01:39:59,279 --> 01:40:01,031
Sobered up!

1285
01:40:02,366 --> 01:40:03,866
Ooh.

1286
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:09,455
I got a feeling there's gonna be
a new marshal in town.

1287
01:40:12,959 --> 01:40:13,835
All right!

1288
01:40:13,876 --> 01:40:17,588
It's time to settle
these free grazers.

1289
01:40:17,671 --> 01:40:19,548
Oh, you leave your horses.

1290
01:40:20,716 --> 01:40:23,510
We're walking down
to their wagon.

1291
01:40:23,552 --> 01:40:26,346
When we get there, you better
empty your guns in them.

1292
01:40:26,388 --> 01:40:29,014
Or I'll damn well
shoot you myself.

1293
01:40:32,853 --> 01:40:35,271
Now, you three skirt
the buildings.

1294
01:40:35,354 --> 01:40:37,023
Get into the alleys
on the side.

1295
01:40:37,064 --> 01:40:39,191
- Come on.

1296
01:41:08,551 --> 01:41:12,097
Hayley!
Come away from there.

1297
01:41:14,599 --> 01:41:16,435
Finish these later.

1298
01:41:21,773 --> 01:41:23,775
Okay.

1299
01:41:23,815 --> 01:41:27,195
I'm not going to my maker
without knowing your given name.

1300
01:41:27,277 --> 01:41:30,572
Mine ain't Waite.
It's Postelwaite.

1301
01:41:30,614 --> 01:41:33,033
Charles Travis Postelwaite.

1302
01:41:33,116 --> 01:41:34,743
What's yours?

1303
01:41:35,576 --> 01:41:37,496
Sure ain't Boss.

1304
01:41:41,832 --> 01:41:45,127
I mean it, Boss.
I'm asking you straight up.

1305
01:41:45,169 --> 01:41:47,171
It's Bluebonnet.

1306
01:41:48,589 --> 01:41:49,465
Bluebonnet?

1307
01:41:49,507 --> 01:41:51,675
Bluebonnet, yeah.

1308
01:41:51,759 --> 01:41:52,592
No middle name?

1309
01:41:52,635 --> 01:41:56,471
No, just Bluebonnet Spearman.
And don't you tell no one.

1310
01:41:57,722 --> 01:42:01,267
I want to hear you swear
an oath. Now, go on.

1311
01:42:01,351 --> 01:42:02,435
I swear it.

1312
01:42:02,519 --> 01:42:05,313
All right.
Okay.

1313
01:42:07,690 --> 01:42:09,776
Just in case.

1314
01:42:25,707 --> 01:42:28,376
Said eight.
Count five.

1315
01:42:34,674 --> 01:42:37,802
You should have run when you
had the chance, Spearman.

1316
01:42:37,843 --> 01:42:40,470
Not much for running
from cowards.

1317
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:43,932
I see the marshal ain't
with you.

1318
01:42:44,016 --> 01:42:45,851
You won't find it so funny

1319
01:42:45,891 --> 01:42:48,729
when you're all shot to hell
and dying.

1320
01:43:01,532 --> 01:43:04,617
- You the one killed our friend?
- That's right.

1321
01:43:04,702 --> 01:43:07,912
I shot the boy, too,
and I enjoyed it.

1322
01:44:40,123 --> 01:44:41,666
Hayley!

1323
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:46,378
Back up!

1324
01:44:50,465 --> 01:44:51,842
Where's the back door?

1325
01:44:51,926 --> 01:44:54,011
- Back door!
- Right this way.

1326
01:45:17,741 --> 01:45:19,784
It's locked.

1327
01:45:38,886 --> 01:45:40,721
You hit?

1328
01:45:40,804 --> 01:45:42,347
I'm good.

1329
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:46,392
You.

1330
01:45:52,065 --> 01:45:54,107
You get out of this house!

1331
01:46:00,072 --> 01:46:01,907
You pull that trigger, Baxter,

1332
01:46:01,991 --> 01:46:04,868
and you can forget about me
patching you up.

1333
01:46:07,620 --> 01:46:10,665
You get your bag.
You're with me.

1334
01:46:10,707 --> 01:46:12,501
Go on.

1335
01:48:09,359 --> 01:48:12,986
Get the hell up, Poole!
On your feet, God damn it!

1336
01:48:16,532 --> 01:48:18,825
Yeah!

1337
01:48:18,868 --> 01:48:22,162
You're... going out there.

1338
01:48:22,204 --> 01:48:24,955
We ain't ourselves yet!

1339
01:48:46,518 --> 01:48:48,436
I see they hobbled you.

1340
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:50,855
It's been a while
since I was in a fight.

1341
01:48:50,897 --> 01:48:53,691
I panicked. Fell back.
Like to have broke my foot.

1342
01:48:53,775 --> 01:48:54,943
Ornery old fool.

1343
01:48:55,025 --> 01:48:58,195
Well, or that damn Cuban cigar
got me riled up.

1344
01:49:02,366 --> 01:49:03,826
Charley.

1345
01:49:03,867 --> 01:49:05,326
You two wait here.

1346
01:49:05,369 --> 01:49:07,537
Hold on, there, Charley.
Hold on.

1347
01:49:07,621 --> 01:49:10,123
I ain't looking over my shoulder
the rest of my days.

1348
01:49:10,207 --> 01:49:12,166
Charley.

1349
01:49:12,209 --> 01:49:14,419
You said we was gonna
kill them all.

1350
01:49:14,502 --> 01:49:16,337
I aim to do just that.

1351
01:49:16,379 --> 01:49:18,130
I meant kill them.
Not murder them.

1352
01:49:18,214 --> 01:49:20,216
Splitting hairs,
ain't you, Boss?

1353
01:49:20,298 --> 01:49:23,845
Mister, I heard what you said.

1354
01:49:24,636 --> 01:49:26,221
I won't come after you.
I promise.

1355
01:49:26,305 --> 01:49:28,390
No, I expect you won't.

1356
01:49:28,473 --> 01:49:30,726
I ain't gonna let you
do it, Charley.

1357
01:49:30,809 --> 01:49:32,978
You do this, you ain't no
different than Poole or Baxter

1358
01:49:33,061 --> 01:49:36,231
or that gunhand of his
that murdered Mose.

1359
01:49:36,315 --> 01:49:38,399
Him killing Mose
is how this started.

1360
01:49:38,482 --> 01:49:40,402
We come for justice,
not vengeance.

1361
01:49:40,484 --> 01:49:42,153
Them is two different things.

1362
01:49:42,236 --> 01:49:44,154
Not today, they ain't.

1363
01:49:45,406 --> 01:49:46,365
Step aside!

1364
01:49:46,407 --> 01:49:48,117
Listen to him, son.

1365
01:49:48,199 --> 01:49:51,244
You done what you had to here
because they give you no choice.

1366
01:49:51,329 --> 01:49:54,164
Don't go making this
into something bad.

1367
01:49:55,623 --> 01:49:57,792
This ain't the way, pard.

1368
01:50:10,095 --> 01:50:12,890
Mister, thank you.

1369
01:50:12,931 --> 01:50:14,223
Thank you.

1370
01:50:14,266 --> 01:50:16,060
Didn't do it for you, boy.

1371
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:18,771
Just make peace
with your bad deeds.

1372
01:50:22,357 --> 01:50:24,108
Sue!

1373
01:50:24,192 --> 01:50:25,943
Get in here!

1374
01:50:26,027 --> 01:50:28,363
Oh, my God.

1375
01:50:36,745 --> 01:50:38,163
Get out of the way.

1376
01:50:40,624 --> 01:50:42,416
Button!

1377
01:51:10,609 --> 01:51:13,070
- Put it down.
- Let the lady be!

1378
01:52:09,539 --> 01:52:12,500
We got your boy, Spearman!

1379
01:52:21,884 --> 01:52:25,220
You better drop them guns
and come walking down the street

1380
01:52:25,262 --> 01:52:27,639
or I shoot him.

1381
01:52:27,723 --> 01:52:29,850
You've got ten seconds!

1382
01:52:31,100 --> 01:52:34,188
We ain't giving up our guns.

1383
01:52:34,270 --> 01:52:36,147
He's gonna kill Button anyway.

1384
01:52:36,231 --> 01:52:37,190
One!

1385
01:52:37,232 --> 01:52:40,610
The only chance for him or us
when we walk up is these guns.

1386
01:52:40,693 --> 01:52:42,861
Two!

1387
01:52:44,656 --> 01:52:46,323
Three!

1388
01:52:46,407 --> 01:52:47,366
Sue!

1389
01:52:47,450 --> 01:52:49,284
Stop!

1390
01:52:49,368 --> 01:52:52,829
Stop it!
Stop it right now!

1391
01:52:58,584 --> 01:53:00,127
Four!

1392
01:53:01,546 --> 01:53:03,548
Sue.

1393
01:53:03,631 --> 01:53:06,217
You're a disgrace,
Marshal Poole.

1394
01:53:06,258 --> 01:53:09,469
You always have been.

1395
01:53:09,553 --> 01:53:12,765
I know it.
That's just the way it is.

1396
01:53:14,141 --> 01:53:15,768
Five!

1397
01:53:17,852 --> 01:53:19,688
Six!

1398
01:53:43,001 --> 01:53:45,586
Have a nice rest,
did you, Marshal?

1399
01:53:45,670 --> 01:53:48,256
You'll be having a long one
yourself in a minute.

1400
01:53:48,298 --> 01:53:49,799
Been enough killing for you?

1401
01:53:49,841 --> 01:53:52,759
Be enough when you're
both dead and buried.

1402
01:53:55,305 --> 01:53:57,556
Let the woman and boy go.
They ain't a part of this.

1403
01:53:57,639 --> 01:54:00,100
If you want considerations,

1404
01:54:00,183 --> 01:54:02,518
you drop them guns
on the ground.

1405
01:54:02,602 --> 01:54:04,229
Let her take him to the doc's.

1406
01:54:04,313 --> 01:54:06,815
The doc's in jail,
and he ain't leaving

1407
01:54:06,898 --> 01:54:09,567
unless your guns
are in the dirt.

1408
01:54:10,443 --> 01:54:13,821
I'll crush any man
who stands with them!

1409
01:54:13,904 --> 01:54:14,947
When I finish that,

1410
01:54:14,989 --> 01:54:18,284
I'll torch your homes and drive
your wives and children

1411
01:54:18,326 --> 01:54:21,329
out into the cold prairie.

1412
01:54:21,411 --> 01:54:24,748
So you women, you better
take hold of your men.

1413
01:54:24,831 --> 01:54:28,001
If you don't, you'll be raising
orphans by winter.

1414
01:54:29,044 --> 01:54:30,920
Mack Langly!

1415
01:54:32,047 --> 01:54:34,799
It doesn't matter
whether you run or stay!

1416
01:54:34,841 --> 01:54:38,136
You and your boys
are already dead!

1417
01:54:39,012 --> 01:54:41,722
Mack Langly is our friend!

1418
01:54:52,649 --> 01:54:54,776
I didn't come all the way
from Ireland

1419
01:54:54,859 --> 01:54:58,946
to see my land pissed on
by free grazers.

1420
01:55:00,030 --> 01:55:03,492
Now, I want them guns
in the dirt.

1421
01:55:04,619 --> 01:55:06,496
Him first.

1422
01:55:06,536 --> 01:55:08,622
The gunhand.

1423
01:55:51,369 --> 01:55:53,955
Looks like you're losing
your army, Marshal.

1424
01:56:12,264 --> 01:56:13,933
Get down!

1425
01:56:53,344 --> 01:56:55,137
It went through?

1426
01:56:55,180 --> 01:56:56,640
Yeah.

1427
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:58,599
Is he hit, Sue?

1428
01:57:00,434 --> 01:57:02,061
- Sue, is he hit?
- No! No!

1429
01:57:02,144 --> 01:57:04,063
But he's bleeding bad again!

1430
01:57:04,145 --> 01:57:06,231
God damn it.
Can you stop it?

1431
01:57:06,314 --> 01:57:07,315
I'm trying.

1432
01:57:07,399 --> 01:57:09,150
I'm gonna kill you, Baxter!

1433
01:57:09,233 --> 01:57:11,903
Well, come on, if you're coming!

1434
01:57:16,324 --> 01:57:17,658
Can you cover me?

1435
01:57:17,700 --> 01:57:21,286
Might be best to wait him out.
Probably bleed to death.

1436
01:57:23,580 --> 01:57:24,665
I ain't waiting.

1437
01:57:24,748 --> 01:57:26,667
Button needs that doctor
right now.

1438
01:57:26,750 --> 01:57:28,377
Well, you know,
that door's locked.

1439
01:57:28,460 --> 01:57:31,045
Well, it won't be
when the scatter-gun hits it.

1440
01:57:31,129 --> 01:57:33,631
I'm waiting for you, Spearman!

1441
01:57:36,176 --> 01:57:39,178
I'm coming for you,
you son of a bitch.

1442
01:57:41,847 --> 01:57:44,016
Okay, Charley?

1443
01:57:44,099 --> 01:57:45,309
Yeah.

1444
01:57:45,351 --> 01:57:47,228
You ready?

1445
01:57:48,144 --> 01:57:49,646
Yeah.

1446
01:58:45,448 --> 01:58:46,866
I'm dying.

1447
01:58:46,907 --> 01:58:49,869
And for what?
More cows?

1448
01:58:49,910 --> 01:58:51,536
Killed a good man.

1449
01:58:51,621 --> 01:58:53,872
And maybe that boy
out there out yonder.

1450
01:58:53,914 --> 01:58:56,416
You get no sympathy
for your death.

1451
01:58:56,458 --> 01:58:58,419
Get!

1452
01:58:58,460 --> 01:59:01,546
You're... nothing.

1453
01:59:01,587 --> 01:59:03,715
Yeah? Maybe so.

1454
01:59:03,798 --> 01:59:07,092
But I'll still be breathing
in another minute.

1455
01:59:07,177 --> 01:59:10,596
Well, kill me, then.

1456
01:59:19,104 --> 01:59:20,271
No.

1457
01:59:21,606 --> 01:59:24,025
I ain't wasting a good bullet
to ease your pain,

1458
01:59:24,108 --> 01:59:25,944
you son of a bitch.

1459
02:01:31,310 --> 02:01:33,436
Your man's in the saloon.

1460
02:01:34,939 --> 02:01:36,857
Ordered everybody out.

1461
02:01:37,774 --> 02:01:41,569
Asked to see your sister
iffen she's willing.

1462
02:01:49,242 --> 02:01:50,994
He'd like to speak with you,
Miss Barlow,

1463
02:01:51,079 --> 02:01:53,957
iffen you ain't offended
by entering a saloon.

1464
02:02:03,089 --> 02:02:04,632
Sue.

1465
02:02:09,095 --> 02:02:10,554
Doc.

1466
02:02:10,596 --> 02:02:12,056
Bring him on up.

1467
02:02:12,097 --> 02:02:14,308
Put him in there.
We'll make room.

1468
02:02:21,982 --> 02:02:23,483
Baxter got any kin?

1469
02:02:23,566 --> 02:02:25,443
Daughter is all he has left.

1470
02:02:25,527 --> 02:02:28,405
It'd be right if somebody
explained things to her.

1471
02:02:28,446 --> 02:02:31,574
There never was
any love lost between 'em.

1472
02:02:31,616 --> 02:02:33,701
Even so, she's his daughter.

1473
02:02:33,785 --> 02:02:36,579
And kin is funny
about such things.

1474
02:02:50,383 --> 02:02:52,385
Come on.
Come on.

1475
02:03:20,202 --> 02:03:22,287
I didn't mean for you
to have to...

1476
02:03:22,330 --> 02:03:24,957
walk into this place
in front of those people.

1477
02:03:24,998 --> 02:03:28,544
I don't care what anyone
out there thinks, Charley.

1478
02:03:28,627 --> 02:03:31,172
You don't have to
stand up for me.

1479
02:03:32,923 --> 02:03:33,965
Well, just the same,

1480
02:03:34,048 --> 02:03:38,345
I wanted to tell you that I'll
be leaving in a day or two.

1481
02:03:44,975 --> 02:03:47,478
I'd like you to stay.

1482
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:49,688
I think others would, too.

1483
02:03:51,690 --> 02:03:54,318
I can't say I haven't
thought about it.

1484
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:56,986
Truth is, there wouldn't be
a corner here

1485
02:03:57,070 --> 02:03:59,780
that don't have
a bad memory for me.

1486
02:04:03,743 --> 02:04:07,037
I've been holding my love
a long time, Charley.

1487
02:04:08,121 --> 02:04:11,166
I know you feel something
for me, too.

1488
02:04:13,752 --> 02:04:15,337
I do.

1489
02:04:17,881 --> 02:04:20,383
But I ain't no more
than those who come to kill us.

1490
02:04:20,425 --> 02:04:22,928
You seen that yourself.

1491
02:04:23,010 --> 02:04:25,179
Maybe you've done
some bad things.

1492
02:04:25,263 --> 02:04:26,681
Maybe worse than bad.

1493
02:04:26,722 --> 02:04:30,017
But what happened here today
wasn't one of 'em.

1494
02:04:33,770 --> 02:04:37,941
And those killings,
they don't give you pause?

1495
02:04:38,734 --> 02:04:41,444
I'm not afraid of you, Charley.

1496
02:04:58,459 --> 02:05:00,670
It brought me luck.

1497
02:05:00,753 --> 02:05:02,423
Just like you said.

1498
02:05:04,007 --> 02:05:05,925
It's yours now.

1499
02:05:05,967 --> 02:05:07,552
You keep it.

1500
02:05:14,225 --> 02:05:15,726
I don't have the answers,
Charley.

1501
02:05:15,810 --> 02:05:18,271
But I know that people
get confused in this life

1502
02:05:18,312 --> 02:05:23,358
about what they want
and what they've done

1503
02:05:23,442 --> 02:05:26,527
and what they think they
should have because of it.

1504
02:05:26,612 --> 02:05:30,948
Everything they think they are
or did takes hold so hard

1505
02:05:31,032 --> 02:05:34,577
that it won't let them see
what they can be.

1506
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:41,417
I've got a big idea
about us, Charley.

1507
02:05:42,835 --> 02:05:45,128
And I'm not gonna wait forever.

1508
02:05:45,211 --> 02:05:47,130
But I am gonna wait.

1509
02:05:47,213 --> 02:05:52,344
And when you're far away,
I want you to think about that.

1510
02:05:53,303 --> 02:05:57,641
And... come back to me.

1511
02:08:33,952 --> 02:08:36,079
I'm in love with you, Sue.

1512
02:08:37,871 --> 02:08:40,916
Been that way since
I first laid eyes on you.

1513
02:08:40,958 --> 02:08:45,587
Just took me a while
to see things clear.

1514
02:08:47,464 --> 02:08:48,882
I know I'm not the kind of man

1515
02:08:48,965 --> 02:08:51,425
you expected to walk up
your front walk.

1516
02:08:52,426 --> 02:08:56,305
If I was your brother,
I wouldn't choose me for you.

1517
02:09:01,601 --> 02:09:03,271
Charley...

1518
02:09:05,690 --> 02:09:08,108
Do you know how old I am?

1519
02:09:08,150 --> 02:09:11,278
Don't care how old you are.

1520
02:09:11,319 --> 02:09:13,362
I'm not a girl anymore.

1521
02:09:15,031 --> 02:09:18,201
You're the handsomest woman
I ever saw.

1522
02:09:18,284 --> 02:09:20,954
I've had my disappointments,
Charley.

1523
02:09:21,036 --> 02:09:23,163
Well, I'm not gonna be
one of them.

1524
02:09:26,458 --> 02:09:29,253
I never thought I'd live
as long as I have, Sue.

1525
02:09:29,335 --> 02:09:33,506
I guess living the way I have,
it never really mattered.

1526
02:09:34,674 --> 02:09:38,344
But thinking I was never gonna
see you again was maybe...

1527
02:09:40,013 --> 02:09:43,224
Was maybe the most awful feeling
I ever had in my life.

1528
02:09:47,811 --> 02:09:52,357
I know I can be
a good husband to you.

1529
02:09:53,483 --> 02:09:55,152
And I know I ain't
asked you proper.

1530
02:09:55,193 --> 02:09:59,072
But I'm asking you now.

1531
02:10:03,576 --> 02:10:06,037
Will you marry me, Sue?

1532
02:10:09,332 --> 02:10:11,417
Charley.

1533
02:10:11,499 --> 02:10:13,335
Yes.

1534
02:10:14,170 --> 02:10:16,087
I'll marry you.

1535
02:10:20,926 --> 02:10:22,968
And can I kiss you?

1536
02:10:44,906 --> 02:10:48,868
I'm gonna give you a thousand
of these before I'm done.

1537
02:11:10,973 --> 02:11:13,140
Hey, Charley!

1538
02:11:13,224 --> 02:11:16,309
Looks like the doc
changed his mind about you.

1539
02:11:22,983 --> 02:11:25,151
Something wrong?

1540
02:11:25,235 --> 02:11:26,903
No.
Everything's fine.

1541
02:11:26,987 --> 02:11:29,197
I forgot to tell you
I'll have word about the saloon

1542
02:11:29,281 --> 02:11:30,240
by the time you get back.

1543
02:11:30,323 --> 02:11:32,116
Sounds good.

1544
02:11:33,827 --> 02:11:35,412
You take care, now.

1545
02:11:36,997 --> 02:11:39,498
Charley.

1546
02:11:39,583 --> 02:11:40,624
Sue.

1547
02:11:40,708 --> 02:11:42,376
I'll be along.

1548
02:11:47,464 --> 02:11:49,299
Saloon?

1549
02:11:49,382 --> 02:11:52,302
Told you I was wanting out
of the cattle business.

1550
02:11:52,386 --> 02:11:56,014
There's a saloon right back
there just had its owner die.

1551
02:11:56,097 --> 02:11:58,015
Hoping you'd be my partner.

1552
02:12:01,894 --> 02:12:04,688
I cant afford something like that.

1553
02:12:04,731 --> 02:12:06,732
Not even half.

1554
02:12:06,773 --> 02:12:10,359
Well let the brains of the outfith
do the thinking.

1555
02:12:10,402 --> 02:12:18,784
Sue!

1556
02:12:18,827 --> 02:12:22,663
You are coming back, aren't you?

1557
02:12:22,705 --> 02:12:28,084
And i will be waiting for you Charles!

1558
02:12:31,796 --> 02:12:37,135
Keep nothing private.

1559
02:12:37,219 --> 02:12:42,473
Have to go back know.

1560
02:12:42,515 --> 02:12:48,395
I don't want to loose side of the roof tops.

1561
02:12:48,437 --> 02:12:53,567
I mean it Sue.

1562
02:12:53,609 --> 02:12:58,656
Got to go!

1563
02:12:58,696 --> 02:13:13,461
How this gonna work if
you don't do what i say.

1564
02:13:13,502 --> 02:13:15,630
I told you, i gonna get 8000

1565
02:13:15,671 --> 02:13:17,005
Before i die!

1566
02:13:17,047 --> 02:13:19,341
You make sure you do.

1567
02:13:57,835 --> 02:13:59,753
Let go get our cows.

1568
02:14:03,909 --> 02:14:13,260
