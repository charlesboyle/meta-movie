1
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,120
They called him Machete.

2
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,380
$70 a day for yard work.

3
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,120
100 for roofing.

4
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,490
Get in.

5
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,080
125 for septic.

6
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,630
Sewage.

7
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,460
Have you ever killed anyone before?

8
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,570
As you may know,
illegal aliens such as yourself

9
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,400
are being forced out of our country
at an alarming rate

10
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,960
for the good of both our people.

11
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,700
Our new senator must die.

12
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,940
And for that I will pay you $150,000...

13
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,000
cash.

14
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,880
He was given an offer
he couldn't refuse.

15
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,780
I cost the most...

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,820
'cause I'm the best there is.

17
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,890
Aah!

18
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,530
Set up, double-crossed,

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,930
and left for dead.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,440
I took a vow of peace.

21
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,440
And now you want me
to help you kill all these men?

22
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,100
Yes, bro.

23
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,080
I mean, Padre.

24
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,580
I'll see what I can do.

25
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,760
He knows the score.

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,320
Where are my wife and daughter?!

27
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,160
He gets the women.

28
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,720
♪ He's back ♪

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,170
♪ Machete ♪

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,230
And he kills the bad guys.

31
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,100
No!

32
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,400
Oh, shit.

33
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,840
You mean that a Mexican day laborer

34
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,810
is a goddamn Federale?!

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,150
But they soon realized...

36
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,480
He's coming after us.

37
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,320
They just fucked with the wrong Mexican.

38
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,720
- Uhh!
Action.

39
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,660
Suspense.

40
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,930
Aaaah!

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,930
Emotion.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,200
Please, Father, have mercy.

43
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,300
God has mercy. I don't.

44
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,540
If you're gonna
hire Machete to kill the bad guy,

45
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,180
you better make damn sure
the bad guy isn't you.

46
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,680
Machete.

47
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,520
Rated "X".

48
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,560
Brought to you from your friends
at The Weinstein Company.

49
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,350
Real pretty tonight, Holly.

50
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,910
God damn it, girls.

51
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,390
If you're gonna do that shit,
do it onstage!

52
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,410
Smokin' hot. Whew!

53
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,290
Cherry, darlin',
I told you too many fuckin' times-

54
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,300
you can't be up there cryin'
and all that shit.

55
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,100
You know what a go-go dance is?

56
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,770
Useless talent number 12?

57
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,830
No, it's a happy dance.

58
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,840
You get up there
and you dance happy.

59
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,140
It's go-go, not cry-cry.

60
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,140
I'm quitting.

61
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,010
You say that
at least one night a week.

62
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,550
I mean it this time.

63
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,020
I need a dramatic change in my life.

64
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,450
I've always said you're funny.

65
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,550
Like that Chris Rock...
only prettier.

66
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,220
But if you don't stop
all that cryin' and shit,

67
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,590
I'm gonna have to fire
your fuckin' ass,

68
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,560
and I don't want to fire your ass
'cause I like lookin' at your ass.

69
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,620
"Any girl leaving early

70
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,460
"must check out with their finger

71
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,660
and have a bye-bye slip."

72
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,710
Here's my finger.

73
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,900
And here's my bye-bye slip.

74
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,320
We're gonna need some cash.

75
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,710
Dick. Fuck!

76
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,760
Aah!

77
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,040
Oh!

78
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,550
Ass bag!

79
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,150
Aah!

80
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,410
All right, boys. Come on.

81
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,240
All right, all right. Come on.

82
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,750
You guys know the drill, huh?

83
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,790
Wait here, Lieutenant.

84
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,350
I'll handle this.

85
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,230
Hey, Abby.

86
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,660
I can see you've had
a spot of trouble, Romey.

87
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,400
Would you like to tell me
what happened?

88
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,440
Well, they-they escaped.

89
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,570
Uh...

90
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,080
All three?

91
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,620
Yeah, I-

92
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,080
I don't know, uh-

93
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,880
I don't know how they did it.
Just, they got out-

94
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,650
I'm sorry, Romey,
but I just don't trust you anymore.

95
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,580
And you know the rules.

96
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,680
Hold on.

97
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,560
I'm out.
I swear, Abby, I'm-I'm-

98
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,030
You're not gonna
see me anymore, okay?

99
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,500
Not so fast.

100
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,040
I also want your balls.

101
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,310
I'm really quite attached to them.

102
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,110
Oh, sweetheart.

103
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,710
I was really attached to my specimens.

104
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,380
Now they're out there in the night
doing God knows what.

105
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,950
I can't do it, Abby. Please.
Please, Abby.

106
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,890
Hey. Hey! What are you guys-

107
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,520
Let me go, you motherfuckers!

108
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,040
Son of a bitch!
Abby! Listen!

109
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,370
You don't need Abby!

110
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,410
There's more!

111
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,311
There's more!
I can get you all you want! Abby!

112
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,900
Fuck! Motherfucking pussies!

113
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,310
Let me go, you son of a bitch!
I can get you more!

114
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,110
No! No! No! Aah!

115
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,780
Aaaaah!

116
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,290
Pick this up, please.

117
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,220
Where's the shit?

118
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,190
The shit's right there.

119
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,900
The deal is still good.

120
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,600
No, it's not.

121
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,700
You held out on me.

122
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,800
Now I want all of it.

123
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,030
Uhh!

124
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,470
Looks like I got you
by the balls, Abby.

125
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,270
You certainly have.

126
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,370
So...

127
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,710
I'll ask you one more time.

128
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,610
Where's...

129
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,850
the...

130
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,480
shit?

131
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,150
Everywhere.

132
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,530
Oh, balls.

133
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,000
Get that thing away from my pumps!

134
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,710
It's just overheating.

135
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,810
I need to get to town.

136
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,090
It's just a stripped radiator cap.

137
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,560
Water leaks when it heats up.

138
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,400
No pressure.

139
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,800
You okay?

140
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,270
I'm just cherry.

141
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,500
Go on and have a seat anywhere.
I'll be right in.

142
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,140
Here, take this with you.

143
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,910
That's your good spring water.

144
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,110
Ain't nothin' good about it.
I bottled it myself.

145
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,910
I get it right there out of the dam.

146
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,890
Thanks...

147
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,450
J.T.

148
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,350
We're serving inside tonight.

149
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,420
The best barbecue in Texas
around the clock.

150
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,760
I gotta go.

151
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,920
Savin' lives, are you?

152
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,260
Now, how did you know that?

153
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,470
Now, that's a rump roast.

154
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,270
Mmm.

155
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,150
Open the shades.

156
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,320
Get some light in here.

157
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,770
Nice night.

158
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,540
Coffee.

159
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,610
Oh, shit.

160
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,210
I couldn't get off work this week.

161
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,890
But you only have to stay till 10:00.

162
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,790
A friend of mine will be here before
10:00 to pick up Tony.

163
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,800
I'm going to eat your brains
and gain your knowledge.

164
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,130
What did I tell you?
No playing with toys at the table.

165
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,000
- Didn't I tell you that?
- Yeah.

166
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,070
There's a packed suitcase
under his bed.

167
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,740
Give it to Tony to take with him
when my friend picks him up.

168
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,940
I'll leave him watching TV.

169
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,750
But you need to be here
in the next 20 minutes.

170
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,180
Thank you.

171
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,460
Hey, what happened to your tooth?

172
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,200
Fell out.

173
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,030
Wow.

174
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,270
Think you can say a prayer
for your old man?

175
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,370
No dead bodies for Da-da tonight.

176
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,210
No dead bodies for Da-da tonight.
Amen.

177
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,510
Amen.

178
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,620
Who was that you were talking to?

179
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,050
Babysitter.

180
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,820
She's on her way.

181
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,860
- You believe her?
- No.

182
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,860
Me, neither.

183
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,980
Fucking catastrophe.

184
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,150
- Hey.
- Hey.

185
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,880
- How's it goin', J.T.?
- All right.

186
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,260
- Still open, I see.
- Oh, yeah, all night.

187
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,890
Cup of coffee
and a pack of cigarettes, please.

188
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,730
Free of charge.

189
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,200
Tonight...

190
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,860
is a special night.

191
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,570
What's so special about tonight?

192
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,470
Been open 25 years.

193
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,150
You should've thrown a party.

194
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,980
I did. See the balloons?

195
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,920
You're the second person
to show up tonight.

196
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,150
Who's the first?

197
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,490
Right there.

198
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,100
Must be passin' through.

199
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,870
Seems only strangers eat here.

200
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,670
I still eat here, J.T.

201
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,400
Oh, yeah, you sure do.

202
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,880
By the way, don't choke
on all that food you're eatin'.

203
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,880
Hello, Palomita.

204
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,100
I don't go by that name anymore.

205
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,630
Why not?

206
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,770
'Cause it's the name you gave me.

207
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,310
So, uh...

208
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,370
you ever become that-
that fancy doctor?

209
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,980
Never did.

210
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,280
I thought for sure you would.

211
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,320
Talked about it enough.

212
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,620
That's the problem with goals-

213
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,750
they become the thing you talk about
instead of the thing you do.

214
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,920
That's my jacket.

215
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,400
I looked for it for two weeks.

216
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,071
Yeah? How long did you
look for me, Wray?

217
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,100
Yeah, well, the jacket belonged to me.
You didn't.

218
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,100
So, um...

219
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,610
what are you doing now?

220
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,270
I'm going to be a standup comedian.

221
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,440
Really?

222
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,250
You're not funny.

223
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,810
That's what I've been trying
to tell everybody,

224
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,190
but they all say I'm hysterical.

225
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,950
But you're not.

226
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,500
Great. Well, that's just fantastic,

227
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,500
because I believed everybody,
and I've already booked shows in town.

228
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,900
Now what am I gonna do?

229
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,170
Yeah. Yeah, that-
that sucks, really.

230
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,370
There's a difference
between being frank

231
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,840
and being dick.

232
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,180
Yeah, well...

233
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,220
it was really good seeing you again.

234
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,050
Oh. Um...

235
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,050
what name do you go by now...

236
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,950
in case I want to catch
one of your shows?

237
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,580
Cherry.

238
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,420
Cherry Darling.

239
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,120
Sounds like a stripper.

240
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,600
No, it sounds like a go-go dancer.

241
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,070
There's a difference.

242
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,540
Right.

243
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,700
Well...

244
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,770
you'll always be Palomita to me.

245
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,150
I need a ride.

246
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,720
What do you say, El Wray?

247
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,060
I'll give you a ride.

248
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,580
Good-bye, Bill.

249
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,910
- Don't you mean "see you later"?
- Of course.

250
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,750
Hey. What's up, Doc?

251
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,920
The little lady's lookin'
pretty good there, I gotta say.

252
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,620
Looks like she could suck
the bend out of a river.

253
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,780
I'm kiddin'. Heh.

254
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,520
- Take a look at that shit.
What happened to your arm?

255
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,860
Well, uh... I got bit.

256
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,230
Bit? Bit by what?

257
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,630
Well, if I told you,
you probably wouldn't believe me.

258
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,600
I need some Bactine or something?

259
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:11,800
Whew.

260
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,140
Can't you just... sew it up?

261
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,910
Well, normally I would.

262
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,780
I'd even be doing something
to stop the bleeding.

263
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,010
The only problem is
this one doesn't bleed.

264
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,880
Oh, shit. Check this out.

265
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,120
When this was still a military hospital,

266
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,220
this one guy came back
from Iraq with this.

267
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,320
Whew!

268
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,550
Chronic herpetic lesions.

269
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,230
When he urinated, it came out
through all these little holes here,

270
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,420
kind of like a fountain.

271
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,990
Oh, Jesus.

272
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,590
Well, how'd you treat it?

273
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,800
Fuck that. I was never in Iraq.

274
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,000
Good for you. The shit they spread
around there you wouldn't believe.

275
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,980
I swear to God.
I've got these Iraqi eyeballs

276
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,010
a friend of mine brought back
to do some studies on.

277
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,210
Incredible. They were
completely milked over.

278
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,810
Mustard gas-
it does that to your eyes.

279
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,560
Actually, I still have those in my fridge.

280
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,180
Bot fly, do you think?

281
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,590
Chronic viral ulcerative lesion.

282
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,320
That looks like gout.

283
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,260
He's running a temperature of 105.

284
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,960
- Is that bad?
- It's high.

285
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,330
Bad will be 108.

286
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,990
You could have a seizure,
go psychotic.

287
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,300
And-and probably die.

288
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,260
Say "ahh."

289
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,780
- Ahh.
- Oh! Jesus!

290
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,670
Oh, nice.

291
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,110
Black abscessed tongue.

292
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,670
All abscesses
should be drained, period.

293
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,710
What are you doing?

294
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:35,980
Shut up, Joe.

295
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,070
Baby... get the needles.

296
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,540
Be right there.

297
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,880
Right now.

298
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:57,810
Asshole.

299
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,030
It's spreading.

300
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,160
Holy shit.

301
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,360
- When did you say you got this bite?
- Just now.

302
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,900
See this?

303
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,370
This shows the advanced stages
of gangrene and epidermal rot.

304
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,100
- And this over here...
- Advanced rot?

305
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,770
Shows the swelling of tissues
and the lack of any type of circulation.

306
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,310
See, you're telling me
that you just got this bite?

307
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,850
- Yeah, just like a half hour ago.
- What I'm seeing here

308
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,220
is a deep impact wound
with several virals

309
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,950
and secondary bacterials,

310
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,080
and that, by the accumulation of
denuded tissue around the incision marks,

311
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,530
indicates that you've had this bite
for over 14 days.

312
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,260
Uh... uh, at least 14 days.

313
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,560
Could that be possible?

314
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,190
14 days? No way. I mean-

315
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,430
Well... what is today?

316
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,740
Today's Wednesday.

317
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,930
The 15th.

318
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,500
Of April.

319
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,170
Aw, hell. Can't I just get
a tetanus shot or something?

320
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,240
We gotta lose the arm, Joe.

321
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,050
Lose the arm?
What do you mean, lose the arm? My arm?

322
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,640
It's spreading all the way
up to your shoulder.

323
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,450
Now, if we don't sever that arm now,
it's gonna take over your chest,

324
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,620
and we can't very well
cut that off, can we?

325
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,251
Well, shouldn't I get a second opinion?

326
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,190
Hi, Joe.

327
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,490
I'm going to give you
a very strong anesthetic,

328
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,830
so you won't feel anything
during the procedure.

329
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,990
These...

330
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,300
are my friends.

331
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,500
My yellow friend...

332
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,810
- ... is just to take the sting off.
- Aah!

333
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,810
My blue friend...

334
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,370
you'll barely feel.

335
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:42,580
That means my yellow friend
is already taking effect.

336
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,140
See how fast my friends work?

337
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,120
And after my red-headed friend...

338
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,290
you'll never see me again.

339
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,350
See me again, see me again.

340
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,470
They all react differently.

341
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,870
Now what?

342
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,940
Dedicated to our own Jungle Julia-

343
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,610
in loving memory.

344
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,060
It's not the radiator.

345
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,890
Damn it.

346
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,780
All right.

347
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,220
Fuckin' thing.

348
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,050
Cheap-whoa.

349
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,420
Damn light.

350
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,390
Ohh.

351
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,500
Hey. Hey!

352
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,400
Hey! Bastard!

353
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,870
Bastard!

354
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,940
Oh, thank God.

355
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,080
Oh.

356
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,980
Oh. Hey!

357
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,550
Hey! Hey!

358
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,850
Get outta
the fuckin' road, bitch!

359
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,240
Ohh! Stop!

360
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,440
Stop!

361
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,310
Please! Stop!

362
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,710
No! No!

363
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,860
What the hell was that?

364
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,160
People picking up road kill.

365
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,800
What, like an armadillo?

366
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,040
Deer.

367
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,640
You get a lot of them around here.

368
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,210
You know, I read a statistic that said...

369
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:31,780
that the eating of venison has risen
30% in the last few years.

370
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,090
60% of that's from road kill.

371
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,090
People eat road kill?

372
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,130
If you're driving out here
at 70 miles an hour

373
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,920
and a deer darts out
in front of you,

374
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,130
if you blink or brake or swerve-

375
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,930
shit, you'll just kill yourself.

376
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,490
So, what do you do?

377
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:49,160
Just pick 'em off...

378
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,710
just like this.

379
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,260
Send it flying away from you.

380
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,830
Unacceptable.

381
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,430
Not really.

382
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,440
It's just a clear case of you or him.

383
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,950
Or her.

384
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,620
Oh, fuck!

385
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,180
Aah! Aah!

386
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,560
Cherry?

387
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:26,910
I thought you said if you saw a deer,
you shouldn't fucking swerve!

388
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,380
It wasn't a deer.

389
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,480
Cherry! Cherry! No!

390
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,100
Aah!

391
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,110
Palomita.

392
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,310
- Don't let her die on me, Block.
- What do we got?

393
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,760
Car accident. Heavy contusions
about the torso,

394
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,520
possible spinal trauma...

395
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,190
one severed limb.

396
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,030
Where's the leg?

397
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,930
Three sickos attacked her.

398
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,800
I shot at them.

399
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,030
I never miss.

400
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,700
They took the leg with them.

401
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,920
You'll have to come with us, Wray.
We need to talk about this, you know?

402
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,360
He has to sign her in.

403
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,590
Do what, now?

404
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,560
Well, he's with her.
He's responsible for her.

405
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:57,600
He can fill this out after we talk.
Let's go.

406
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,060
Okay.

407
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,470
Okay! Fuck!

408
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:04,900
Hey, Block.

409
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,280
No, you do it.

410
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,250
Suit yourself.

411
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,150
What are you doing
with a rifle, Wray?

412
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,680
Nothing.

413
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,441
Just thinking about maybe doing
some hunting when the season breaks.

414
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,980
Come on, Wray.

415
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,590
You know you're not supposed
to be doing that stuff anymore.

416
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,600
Not even hunting?

417
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:33,030
Not even hunting.
And you know that.

418
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,700
Not with your history.

419
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:37,900
And here I stick my neck out for you.

420
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,200
I stick it out far.

421
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,010
Now you've got a gal in your wrecked truck
with a missing leg?

422
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,970
A missing leg that's now missing?

423
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,140
And here you're saying
in front of everybody

424
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,050
that someone up and snatched it?

425
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,520
And that you shot at 'em with a gun

426
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,680
that you never should've had
in the first place?

427
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,020
And that now they're gone?

428
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,960
What if I find the leg?

429
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,290
So, now you know where it is?

430
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,360
You'll tell us where it is,
give us a full confession, you're saying?

431
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,631
Sheriff, can we finish
this conversation somewhere else?

432
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,800
My thought exactly.

433
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:14,400
I know it sounds a little arrogant
puttin' up a sign-

434
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,970
"Best damn barbecue in Texas..."

435
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,880
"Period."

436
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:22,110
But, hell...

437
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,350
who's gonna come in here
and argue about that?

438
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,420
Oh, yeah.
Big contest comin' up.

439
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,390
Mm.

440
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,030
I'm workin' on the perfect sauce.

441
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,090
Yeah.

442
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,830
That'll put me on the Food Channel.

443
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,900
Put this place back on the map
where it belongs.

444
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,270
I'll talk to you later.

445
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,220
Can I interest y'all in a plate of
soon-to-be-award-winnin' barbecue?

446
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,130
You're from Dinky's, ain't ya?

447
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,400
Well, you tell that sumbitch,

448
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:14,060
he thinks he's gonna come over here
and get my recipes...

449
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:18,370
well, I got a double-barreled answer
to his query right inside.

450
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,510
God damn, that's good.

451
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,380
Doctor Block!

452
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:33,290
Three fresh ones rollin' in!

453
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,480
Christ, you're kidding.

454
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,790
Automobile accident
off of Highway 18.

455
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,260
DOAs?

456
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,730
Have Andy pick 'em up.

457
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,490
He's already on 620
picking up another two.

458
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,160
Fucking Wednesday nights.

459
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,840
That's unsanitary, Doc.

460
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,840
Not if I'm the only one using it.

461
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,210
Helps me monitor
my state of calmness.

462
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,740
Yeah, don't get all worked up
enough to crack it.

463
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:56,800
Fuck.

464
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,940
You might cut yourself pretty good.

465
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,110
Then I'd know I was not calm.

466
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,990
Yeah, what do you say now, Doc?

467
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,450
Somebody call my wife.

468
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,650
DC-2?

469
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,980
Mm.

470
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,680
Yeah.

471
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:43,090
Well, what about
countering with atropine?

472
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,150
Yeah.

473
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,130
Okay. Gotcha, gotcha.

474
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,630
Well, boys, I'm beat.

475
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,470
I gotta get home.
I'll see y'all tomorrow.

476
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,870
All right, then.
Thanks for the extra help, Earl.

477
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,610
Hey, Wray.

478
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,310
You in trouble again?

479
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,470
Just passin' through, I hope.

480
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,680
Well, me, too.

481
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,910
How's the wife, Earl?

482
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,390
Well, she's not too good.

483
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,550
Thanks for askin'.

484
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,190
Most of it's her own doin', you know.

485
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,360
Smokin' them goddamn cigarettes.

486
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,060
Pack a day for 40 years.

487
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,570
Yeah, she doesn't want anything
to do with, uh... chemo.

488
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,600
So... it does take its toll.

489
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,770
You don't smoke, do you, Wray?

490
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,770
No.

491
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:39,380
That's probably good.

492
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,820
See y'all.

493
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,990
You're gonna start by telling me

494
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,750
when you first started
carrying this gun.

495
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,090
And then we'll move up

496
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,600
to when you first set eyes
on this gal Cherry.

497
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:40,740
Okay.

498
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,740
Okay.

499
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,150
Sheriff Hague.

500
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,020
It's J.T., Sheriff.

501
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,150
J.T., how's the barbecue business?

502
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,660
Ever since that bastard landlord
raised the rent, it's gone to shit.

503
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,790
Well, I'm real sorry
to hear about that.

504
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,350
I wish there was something
I could do.

505
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,700
Right now I ain't callin' my brother.
I'm callin' the sheriff.

506
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,140
I'm listening. What's the trouble?

507
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,510
Well, there ain't no trouble.
Not yet, anyway.

508
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,240
I got two delinquents been hangin'
around here for over an hour.

509
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,440
They won't purchase
and they won't leave.

510
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,880
Oh, never mind. Here they come.

511
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,390
You cook that meat
at 250 degrees, don't you?

512
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,150
I don't remember.
I set the heat with my hand.

513
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:32,060
You give me that recipe, or I'll raise
your rent higher than a Georgia pine.

514
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,600
Brother, ain't no Texan's ever gonna
give you his barbecue recipe.

515
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,830
That's a fact.
He'll take it to his grave.

516
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,330
I could be bleedin' like a stuck pig,
I ain't gonna tell you.

517
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,030
I could be dyin' in your arms,
I ain't gonna tell you!

518
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,830
- Heh heh heh.
- We'll see about that.

519
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,070
You gonna look...

520
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,180
or you gonna eat?

521
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,150
You called for me?

522
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,060
I need for you to see this.

523
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,950
Looks like a no-brainer.

524
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,430
What does that mean?

525
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,090
No brain.

526
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:13,860
Scooped clean out of her skull.

527
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,670
Oh, oh, oh!
I know what this is.

528
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,260
Don't tell me.
Uh... liquefactive necrosis.

529
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,670
You think?

530
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,900
Oh, sure, yeah.

531
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,570
Thank you. That'll be all.

532
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,420
Oh...

533
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,720
Did you know she was back in town?

534
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,820
No.

535
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,460
I didn't.

536
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,570
What happened to her?

537
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,640
I don't know, baby.

538
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,040
I thought you stopped
seeing each other.

539
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,290
We have.

540
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,090
Well, yes, you have now-
she's fucking dead.

541
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:15,160
I mean, we-
we stopped before.

542
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,200
I-

543
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,470
I haven't talked to her in a while.

544
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,610
But you've written each other.

545
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,680
Here and there.

546
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,510
But not-

547
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,110
What are you doing?!

548
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,490
Let me see your last three messages.

549
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,290
- You have no right.
- I don't?

550
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,330
I don't have a right?

551
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,960
Show it to me.

552
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,800
Show it to me.

553
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,030
No.

554
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,340
Aah!

555
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,780
Now, that's just to take the sting off.

556
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,810
Show it to me.

557
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,870
No, please.

558
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:12,820
- Show... it... to... me!
- Aaahh! Aah! Aah!

559
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,620
Now let's see how fast
your friends work.

560
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,310
That's pretty fast.

561
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:39,150
Oh, what do I know, my love?

562
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,880
Exactly.

563
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:44,680
That you're a cheating, lying...

564
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,690
sack.

565
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,990
I didn't want to hurt you.

566
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,620
But you did.

567
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,060
Bill...

568
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:57,190
you're insane.

569
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,960
And I was afraid...

570
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,340
of what you might do to me,

571
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:07,240
to our son.

572
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,580
I'm the mother of your son.

573
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,100
Aah!

574
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,920
And after this one...

575
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,520
I'll never see you again.

576
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,070
Doc.

577
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,770
What?

578
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,470
You gotta see this.

579
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,140
I'll be right there.

580
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,920
Where the hell are the bodies?

581
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,930
That's what we wanted to show you.

582
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,050
They're gone.

583
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,430
They didn't just get up
and walk out, did they?

584
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,060
♪ Mmm-hmm ♪

585
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,630
Shut the fuck up!

586
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:14,380
Somebody take care of this perp for me
before I fucking kill him!

587
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
What the hell's going on?

588
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:18,170
Ah, he was causin' a ruckus
over at Skip's place, so I cuffed him,

589
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:21,940
and the son of a bitch
bit my goddamn finger off.

590
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,610
Quit your hollerin' and get yourself
a goddamn Band-Aid.

591
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,180
I'm not exaggerating,
using colorful speech, Sheriff.

592
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,490
He bit my finger clean off!

593
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,360
Fucking shit!

594
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,120
Get out there and book him,

595
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,160
'cause I'll fuckin' kill him
if I have to do it.

596
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,790
Carlos, go get him.

597
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:40,730
Wray, you stay put.

598
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,990
Are you sure he's in there?

599
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,560
He was.

600
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,120
Motherfucker.

601
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,930
He's gone.

602
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,200
Broke out the window.

603
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,240
Where's my finger?

604
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,830
Found your ring.

605
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,570
Could it be the same guy
as your leg-snatcher?

606
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,530
I didn't get
a good look at mine.

607
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,270
That him over there?

608
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,260
Whoa! Whoa!

609
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:50,660
Aah!

610
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,300
Wray?

611
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,440
Fuck.

612
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:14,580
You motherfucker!

613
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,890
Uhh!

614
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:48,660
- No, don't touch him!
- Why not?

615
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,950
He's infected.

616
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:51,420
With what?

617
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:52,690
Everything.

618
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,490
Wray!
Drop the fuckin' gun.

619
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:04,160
Where the fuck
do you think you're going?!

620
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,230
I'm gonna go get Cherry!

621
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:09,000
Fine. But we're taking my car.

622
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,950
I'm riding with you.

623
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:19,950
Don't make any sudden moves.

624
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:34,260
Viral infections.

625
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,500
They came pouring in.

626
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:40,510
Some are rapidly developing
coliform lesions.

627
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,600
Highly contagious.

628
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,440
What do you think?

629
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,040
Self-preservation comes to mind.

630
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,610
Yeah. Let's get the hell out of here.

631
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,250
First let me get my wife.

632
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,450
I love you, sweetie.

633
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:05,050
There you go, bunny rabbit.

634
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:06,650
Come on, come on.

635
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:08,390
Open up, now.

636
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,630
I want you to be around for a while,
you understand?

637
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,260
We don't want you checkin' out
right this-

638
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:16,070
God... damn.

639
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,060
Ramona.

640
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,540
You been fartin' like a goddamn
pack mule since I met-

641
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:23,600
God damn!

642
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,310
I hate to do this to you, Earl,

643
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,850
but we need every man on the job!

644
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,510
The shit has hit the fan!

645
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:32,680
Bring some guns... and ammo!

646
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,620
Meet me at my brother's!

647
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:36,160
I gotcha. I'll be there.

648
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:39,660
Gotta eat quick, sweetie.

649
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:40,850
Come on.

650
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:44,460
Ramona.

651
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,030
Ramona.

652
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:52,400
Aah!

653
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:25,970
Uhh!

654
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,500
Aaaah!

655
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,210
Oh, my God.

656
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,560
What the hell is goin' on?

657
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,910
Are you gonna give me a gun?

658
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,740
Are you fucking kidding me?

659
00:50:58,030 --> 00:50:59,330
Fuck.

660
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,000
Oh! Fuck me!

661
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:05,470
God damn it!

662
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:08,270
Let's sort this shit out, boys!

663
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,680
Dumbass.

664
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,770
Yeah.

665
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,320
Not today! Not today!

666
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:20,690
Fucking Wednesday nights!

667
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:24,250
Aaah!

668
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:58,690
Uhh!

669
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:21,380
Palomita?

670
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:27,050
Get up. We're leaving.

671
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,560
I can't walk.

672
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,750
So what? Get up!

673
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:31,920
- Get-
- Aah!

674
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:33,090
Uhh!

675
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,950
Motherfucker.

676
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:38,930
Look at me!

677
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,700
I was gonna be a standup comedian.

678
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:44,400
But who's gonna laugh now?

679
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:46,340
Some of their best jokes
are about cripples.

680
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:47,500
Let's go.

681
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,200
It's not funny. It's pathetic.

682
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,760
Would you stop cryin' over fuckin'...

683
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:51,970
spilled milk?

684
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:54,210
I have no leg!

685
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:05,660
Now you do.
What do you think?

686
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:12,530
You could carry me, Wray.

687
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,830
Yeah? You never wanted that before.

688
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,830
Why start now?

689
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,360
Ah-ah!

690
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:23,970
Uhh!

691
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:26,140
Ahh!

692
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:27,270
Uhh!

693
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:32,040
This is fucking ridiculous.

694
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:39,280
The sheriff must've
taken the others to J.T.'s.

695
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,450
Get in.

696
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,930
God damn it, wait for me.

697
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:02,310
My leg's stuck in the door!

698
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:04,320
- It's just wood.
- It's splintering.

699
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:06,150
Will you just leave it alone?

700
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,650
Why is this happening to me?

701
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,620
I don't know. Just-
just do me a favor right now and just...

702
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:12,490
stay strong.

703
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:15,260
"Stay"?

704
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:18,800
Yeah, baby. Stay.

705
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,590
Okay, my name is Electra.

706
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:23,870
Fucking listen.

707
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,700
My name is Electra.
Her name is Electra, too.

708
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:29,740
It's furry.

709
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:32,710
No.

710
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:34,480
He's a furry one.

711
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:36,980
She goes by Lia, I go by El.
El from "Electra", Ame from "Amelia".

712
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:39,150
Does that make
any fucking sense in your head?

713
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,880
You can call me whatever the fuck
you want-I don't give a shit.

714
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:54,000
Oye, chica.

715
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:55,760
- You said 10:00!
- I'm sorry.

716
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,000
We can't be watching your kid
all goddamn night!

717
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:00,560
Your friend never showed up,
and we got shit to do!

718
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,170
That's right.

719
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,210
Then start doing it.

720
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:06,940
Oh!

721
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,680
Uhh!

722
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:13,250
Tony! We're leaving!

723
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:16,480
Wait, my tarantula.

724
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,420
Bring it. Let's go.

725
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:19,860
And my turtle.

726
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:21,650
And my scorpion.

727
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:25,030
We're not all octopuses.
We can't carry everything.

728
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,530
"Octopi."

729
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,540
Ohh... come on, let's go.

730
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,270
Tony, what did I tell you?

731
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:40,080
You can't bring them all.
Didn't I tell you that?

732
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:42,620
It's okay. They can live
in the same tank.

733
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,240
What about my pocket bike?

734
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,620
It's in the trunk.

735
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:48,090
Aah!

736
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,450
Where do you think you're going,
you fucking bitch?!

737
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,690
We're gonna fuckin' kill you!

738
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,610
Are you sure you want to do this?

739
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,750
Everybody grab a badge and a gun.

740
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:21,220
You're all deputies
as of this moment forward.

741
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:22,880
Except for you, Wray.

742
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,730
Yo.

743
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,170
What do we got?

744
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,000
Something's wrong up there.

745
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:40,210
J.T. always comes out and greets.

746
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,370
Let's go.

747
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,580
Try not to shoot yourselves.

748
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,580
Don't shoot each other.

749
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,150
But especially...

750
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,090
don't shoot me.

751
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,660
J.T.?

752
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:13,240
Go on! Get off him, Rusty!

753
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,240
God damn, J.T.

754
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:22,740
Yah!

755
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,160
Barbecue?

756
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:36,560
Asshole.

757
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,000
Damn good sausage link, J.T.

758
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:42,800
Best in Texas.

759
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:45,030
Must've passed out
after I killed those things.

760
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,100
Nice shootin'.

761
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:50,470
Everybody gather up supplies.

762
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,100
We head out in 20!

763
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:57,310
I think I nailed it.

764
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,440
Holy shit, I think I finally cracked it.

765
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,850
I finally found my-
my award-winning barbecue sauce!

766
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:05,930
Your blood's in it.

767
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:12,030
God damn it, he's right.

768
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:31,480
Hey, my other tooth fell out.

769
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:34,320
Heh.

770
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,450
It sure did.

771
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:40,490
Hey, your tooth fell out, too.

772
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:46,430
We're toothless buddies.

773
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,940
Oh, we sure are.

774
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,910
I want you to open that for Mommy.

775
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,540
Now, take the gun.

776
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,590
Careful.

777
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:11,490
And if anyone comes to the door
that isn't me,

778
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,580
I want you to shoot them, okay?

779
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:15,690
I'm not kidding, Tony.

780
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,430
You shoot them...

781
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,520
just like your video games.

782
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,540
You shoot them in the head.

783
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,470
What if it's Dad?

784
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:27,570
Especially if it's your dad.

785
00:59:39,850 --> 00:59:42,250
And be careful
where you point that thing.

786
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,690
You'll blow your own face off.

787
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,560
I'll be right back.

788
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:48,360
I love you.

789
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:10,140
Tony!

790
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:13,910
Aah!

791
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:15,320
Hello, baby.

792
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:20,150
Ohh!

793
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:33,670
I'm gonna eat your brains...

794
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:37,070
and gain your knowledge.

795
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:37,940
Stay away!

796
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:45,650
Look what you did to our son!

797
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,420
Stay away!

798
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:02,900
God damn it, I told you
I didn't want to see you again.

799
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:04,940
Daddy!

800
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,270
Get your sorry ass in here!

801
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:10,330
Aah!

802
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:15,940
If it's escape vehicles you want,
escape vehicles I got.

803
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:17,310
Right this way.

804
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:19,480
Watch that meat.

805
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:20,950
Meet my wife.

806
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:24,780
Jesse James Custom Dominator.

807
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:27,260
I made Jesse a plate of barbecue
so goddamn good,

808
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:29,760
he made this baby for me
free of fuckin' charge. Heh heh heh.

809
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:31,860
Got anything that could
transport more people?

810
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:35,630
Where's the top?

811
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,930
This baby's chopped permanent.

812
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:40,030
Ain't got no roll bar, chicken wire,
none of that shit.

813
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:42,040
- No protection.
- But she's fast.

814
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:45,080
Nitrous-injected,
350-horsepower engine.

815
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:46,980
Who are you?

816
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:48,110
I mean, really.

817
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:50,410
Wray's Wreckage.

818
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:52,480
That's what it says on your truck.

819
01:01:57,490 --> 01:01:59,520
Are you a wrecker, Wray?

820
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:01,420
I'm nobody.

821
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:04,830
It's the easiest thing to remember.

822
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,200
So remember it.

823
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:12,630
Just stack 'em
on top of the counter.

824
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,570
Hey, you want some barbecue?

825
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,770
Heh heh heh. Best in Texas.

826
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:20,370
Aw, no, thanks.

827
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:22,040
What's the matter,
you don't eat meat?

828
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,780
Oh, I eat meat.

829
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:26,290
I also eat lots of shit.

830
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:28,150
You see this?

831
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:29,420
What's that?

832
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:30,790
Shit-eating grin.

833
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,320
You ought to be a comedian.

834
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,790
What do you think of the leg?

835
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:38,090
Oh, that's funny.

836
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:41,190
How's your stump?

837
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:43,130
They knocked it out something fierce.

838
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,360
Still can't feel a thing.

839
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:48,670
This must be the real Bone Shack.

840
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:53,070
Old J.T. knows how to live.

841
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:55,550
Like fuck he does.

842
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:00,320
I like how you say "fuck".

843
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:02,450
Good. Fuck you.

844
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:04,720
Fuck me?

845
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,090
Oh, so, now you're the comedian.

846
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:13,400
Go ahead, drop your pants.

847
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:15,630
That'll be good for a laugh.

848
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:18,100
I highly doubt that.

849
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:26,240
That's my jacket.

850
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:28,250
Yes, I know.

851
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,280
I looked for it for two weeks.

852
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:35,180
Look, you were being
an unbelievable dick.

853
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:37,490
I was walking out on you.

854
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,890
I was cold.
I took your fucking jacket.

855
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,660
So, if you're gonna go on one of your
psycho obsessive controlling rants

856
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:46,670
about a fucking jacket,
then fucking take it,

857
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:49,970
'cause I'd rather fucking freeze
than fucking hear about it one more time.

858
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:53,970
Did you find what was in the pocket?

859
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,700
Fuck no.

860
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:57,140
Look for it.

861
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:01,880
No, the other one.

862
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:14,060
I was gonna give it to you,
but you left me.

863
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,260
You took the jacket.

864
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:21,700
And I looked for it for two weeks.

865
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:24,060
Read it.

866
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:33,710
"Two against the world."

867
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:37,820
Remember that?

868
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:41,050
I never forgot it.

869
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:44,480
Then why'd you leave?

870
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,990
Because you didn't believe in us,

871
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:49,460
or in me.

872
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:14,180
I figured one of them new deputies
might end up shootin' me,

873
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,880
but not you, Tolo!

874
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:17,440
Sorry. I'm sorry.

875
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:19,420
- Dumbass.
- You're gonna be all right.

876
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:20,980
- McGraw's here.
Now, now, now.

877
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,180
- And a whole bunch of others.
- Everybody in!

878
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:24,250
Come on!

879
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:25,820
Over here.

880
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:27,520
Move your ass! Come on!

881
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,610
What did I tell you, Tony?

882
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:51,050
Don't point the gun at yourself.

883
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:53,820
Didn't I tell you that?

884
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,450
Thank you for telling me about...

885
01:06:57,530 --> 01:06:58,580
you know.

886
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:00,520
Don't mention it.

887
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,430
That's an order.

888
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,190
If I had known that you were...

889
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:08,690
El Wray...

890
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:11,030
I wouldn't have given you
such a hard time.

891
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:13,730
I didn't mean to be a prick about it.

892
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:16,300
Need-to-know basis, that kind of shit.

893
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,710
Take this.

894
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:21,540
Do what you do best.

895
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:25,720
No, you're not!

896
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:27,190
Don't give him the gun. Not-

897
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:28,780
Give him the gun, Tolo.

898
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:32,450
Give him the gun.

899
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:35,190
Give him all the guns.

900
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,410
Holy shit.

901
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:54,870
That boy's got the devil in him.

902
01:07:58,150 --> 01:07:59,180
We gotta fight them off.

903
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,590
Get to our vehicles.

904
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,650
Everyone behind me!

905
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,490
Outside now!

906
01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:37,650
God damn you!

907
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,970
Everybody back inside!

908
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,570
You, Skip.

909
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:01,620
Front and center.

910
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:05,410
You go out front,
start up the Kill Dozer.

911
01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:07,610
We'll need it to transport
the other survivors.

912
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,120
You fuckin' crazy?
I'm not goin' out there.

913
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:12,620
- I'll cover you.
- I'm not goin'.

914
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,130
I never miss.

915
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,160
Come on, Skip.

916
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:18,100
It's go-go.

917
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:20,070
Not cry-cry.

918
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:22,160
Cherry!

919
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:33,970
Oh, dear.

920
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:43,050
Ah!

921
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:00,630
Aah!

922
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:22,690
J.T.!

923
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,560
You take whoever you can fit
in your convertible.

924
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:25,720
Everyone else on board!

925
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,401
Skip, grab the twins!
Come along with me!

926
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,730
You take the chopper.

927
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,430
I need someone else
to drive my truck!

928
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:32,840
I'll do it.

929
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:36,900
You're bleedin' like a stuck pig.

930
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:39,070
Your vision's blurred
and you're on your last legs.

931
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:40,440
Anything else?

932
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:42,040
Don't wreck it.

933
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,950
Somebody grab the slaw!

934
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:46,880
You can't have no barbecue
without coleslaw!

935
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:48,510
- Give me a gun.
- Take this.

936
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,750
Fucking cool!

937
01:10:52,730 --> 01:10:54,790
All right, y'all, head out.
I'll hold 'em off.

938
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,790
I can take care of myself.

939
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:01,060
Bye, Daddy.

940
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:04,330
Do you remember how to ride a bike?

941
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:06,170
Useless talent number 32.

942
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:08,500
Good.

943
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:10,310
Anyone else have a car?

944
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,300
Now, you're sure you're okay
driving this thing?

945
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,650
Hell yeah.

946
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:24,250
Dakota...
we're sorry about Tony.

947
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:26,150
Thanks.

948
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:29,750
Your engine is shot
and you've got three blown tires.

949
01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:31,820
But I've got his pocket bike
in the trunk.

950
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:35,070
Is it fast?

951
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:37,130
Zero to fifty in four seconds.

952
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,140
You ride with her.

953
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:41,900
I'm Cherry.

954
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:43,500
You sure are.

955
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:46,310
Move out!

956
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:48,400
Damn shame.

957
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:23,340
Rusty!

958
01:12:23,450 --> 01:12:25,280
Aah!

959
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:26,790
God damn it!

960
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:27,840
Aah!

961
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:07,090
Sheriff! How much ammo we got?

962
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,500
Not enough.

963
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:25,780
Don't shoot!
We're not infected!

964
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:37,480
All survivors gotta come with us.

965
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:40,190
Especially you...

966
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,190
El Wray.

967
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:45,700
I don't go by that name anymore.

968
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:02,210
It's okay. It's okay.

969
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:06,480
We're here in quarantine
with the other survivors.

970
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,030
Where is here?

971
01:14:19,230 --> 01:14:20,930
The old army base.

972
01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:23,770
El Wray?

973
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,740
That you?

974
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:30,730
He's with them.
I saw him in their convoy earlier.

975
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:32,570
I'm a scientist...

976
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:35,080
and a businessman.
Not military.

977
01:14:35,150 --> 01:14:38,850
Which is why he's gonna tell us
what the fuck is going on.

978
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:42,650
They're stealing biochemical weapons.

979
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,020
DC-2?

980
01:14:44,090 --> 01:14:46,460
Also known as "Project Terror."

981
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:50,560
Designed to take out an entire populace
in a controlled landlocked area.

982
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:52,600
You were supplying it to them.

983
01:14:53,870 --> 01:14:56,930
- That's why they shut you out.
- They found my supply.

984
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,970
It's under our feet.

985
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:00,970
Ten stories down.

986
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,480
What about countering
with atropine and PAM-2?

987
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:07,410
Interferes with the neurotoxic delivery,
sets off the cell-blaster,

988
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:10,940
and you're gushing blood and pus
through every sacred hole in your body.

989
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:12,450
Appetizing.

990
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:16,150
The only treatment
is a regimented exposure to DC-2 itself.

991
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:17,780
It delays the negative effects.

992
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:19,330
They need it...

993
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:21,660
like a drug.

994
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:24,290
Correct. But we found that
a small percentage of people

995
01:15:24,370 --> 01:15:26,530
are not affected by the gas itself,

996
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:29,130
and within this small percentage
lies a cure.

997
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,830
What do you want to do?

998
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,500
Mexico.

999
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:37,370
Put our backs against the ocean

1000
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,040
and defend ourselves from there.

1001
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:40,980
No. We have to get back to my lab.

1002
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:43,040
This infection will spread
all over the world,

1003
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,110
to every man, woman and child,

1004
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:46,740
unless I finish my antidote.

1005
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,480
You have an antidote?

1006
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,130
You! You!

1007
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:00,100
Come with us.

1008
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:02,430
Move it!

1009
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,670
Move it, Peggy!

1010
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:09,010
Uhh!

1011
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,020
Do you like Ava Gardner?

1012
01:16:25,190 --> 01:16:26,350
I'm sorry?

1013
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,860
Ava Gardner.
Do you like her?

1014
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:35,930
Yeah, I guess.

1015
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,860
I was just thinking that you, uh...

1016
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:40,960
kind of look like Ava Gardner
a little bit.

1017
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:50,940
You got something
you want to say to me?

1018
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:53,980
I have nothing to say to you.

1019
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:55,950
You got nothing to say, huh?
That's funny.

1020
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:59,050
'Cause I could've swore you just
gave me a "fuck you" look right now.

1021
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:01,450
You want to say "fuck you" to me?

1022
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:03,690
Not at this moment.

1023
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,920
You know what this is?

1024
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:10,990
A gun.

1025
01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:13,160
It's simplicity itself.

1026
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:16,170
You see, you point it
at what you want to die...

1027
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:19,100
and you pull the little trigger here...

1028
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:22,250
and a little bullet comes out of here.

1029
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,580
And the little bullet
hits you right there.

1030
01:17:26,690 --> 01:17:27,880
And you know what?

1031
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:31,650
You don't look like
Ava Gardner no more.

1032
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,260
Don't taunt me, tramp.

1033
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:42,630
I am not one to be taunted.

1034
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:43,830
You got it?

1035
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:48,930
Let me here you say, "I got it."

1036
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:51,340
I got it.

1037
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:53,280
You damn well better.

1038
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:02,590
Tool.

1039
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:09,890
God damn it, that's it.

1040
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,460
I figured it out.

1041
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:14,900
Salt.

1042
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:16,440
Got it all figured out. It's salt.

1043
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:17,990
Blood is salty.

1044
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:20,510
That's all my sauce needed,
was just a little more salt.

1045
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:23,670
It just needed a little thickening agent.
You know what I'm talkin' about?

1046
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:24,870
What are you doing, J.T.?

1047
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,880
That's all I gotta do,
is put a little more salt in.

1048
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:29,280
It'd just do the same goddamn thing
that the blood did.

1049
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:31,750
I tell you what, brother,
that little bit of blood did the trick.

1050
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:33,720
Don't do nothin' stupid, J.T.
I got it covered.

1051
01:18:33,790 --> 01:18:36,830
It's already got my sweat, it's got my tears.
Now all it needs is some blood!

1052
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:41,820
- Drop the gun!
- J.T.!

1053
01:18:43,530 --> 01:18:45,020
- Do it now!
- Okay, okay!

1054
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:46,500
Don't shoot!

1055
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:47,730
J.T., you all right?

1056
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:50,230
Uhh!

1057
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:58,870
Hey, you all right, bro?

1058
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:00,821
God damn it,
I'm not all right at all, brother.

1059
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,310
Not at all.

1060
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:04,010
Wait here.

1061
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,250
Oh... I sure will.

1062
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,320
Goddamn sauce.

1063
01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:20,860
"Women in Cages".

1064
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:22,730
See them in action.

1065
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,070
See them in love.

1066
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:28,610
See them in terror.

1067
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:31,240
White skin on the black market.

1068
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:34,510
Soft flesh for hard cash.

1069
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:36,640
"Women in Cages."

1070
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,840
I'm gonna go get my dick wet.

1071
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:41,110
She's got one leg.

1072
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:42,850
Easier access.

1073
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,290
You got a point.

1074
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:56,100
Get the rest of this shit upstairs
and we'll blow this entire floor.

1075
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:57,160
Yes, sir.

1076
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,680
Get Lewis down here.

1077
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:16,280
He's getting his dick wet, sir.

1078
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,520
Get him the fuck down here now!

1079
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,330
Lewis?

1080
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,460
Wilson?

1081
01:20:47,450 --> 01:20:48,580
Where are my men?

1082
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:50,750
I've got several right here.

1083
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:54,530
What the fuck's this?

1084
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:56,820
Their balls, sweetheart.

1085
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,800
I'm walking out of here
with this shit, Wray.

1086
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:05,100
- Let us go.
- Tell me why we should.

1087
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:06,200
Because I earned it.

1088
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:07,830
How do you figure that?

1089
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:11,210
You want the story?
I'll spin it for you quick.

1090
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,150
A termite's nest of caves
on the Afghan border,

1091
01:21:14,210 --> 01:21:17,340
me and my men walking around
with our dicks in our hands

1092
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:21,150
and our balls in our throats,
lookin' for America's most wanted.

1093
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:22,710
- Bin Laden.
- Yeah.

1094
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:24,920
For once, our intel
was right on the money.

1095
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:26,220
I come around a corner-

1096
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:28,230
bam, there he is,
lookin' me right in the eyes.

1097
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,420
Wait.

1098
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,460
You killed bin Laden?

1099
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:34,900
I put two in his heart,
one in his computer.

1100
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,990
So that was you.

1101
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:38,370
Yeah.

1102
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,540
That was me.

1103
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:44,670
Class-A clusterfuck.

1104
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:48,040
He wasn't supposed to be there,
we weren't supposed to be there,

1105
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:51,950
and I sure as fuck wasn't supposed to be
the one to punch his dialysis ticket.

1106
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:55,920
So, instead of a chest full of medals,
we get a face full of DC-2.

1107
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:58,150
No cure.

1108
01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:00,660
That is, not until we found
somebody from the other side

1109
01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:02,750
willing to sell us batches of this shit.

1110
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:06,090
Science comes first, but business
comes a close fucking second.

1111
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:09,660
Then you realized if you could
infect a large enough populace,

1112
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:12,860
the experiment and its survivors,

1113
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:14,600
you'd find a cure.

1114
01:22:14,670 --> 01:22:17,370
I swore to my men
that I'd do everything in my power

1115
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,930
to keep them alive.

1116
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:21,170
And that's what I intend to do, Wray.

1117
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:24,710
Understand?

1118
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:28,590
I never had a choice.

1119
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:32,990
Neither do I, sir.

1120
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:37,830
God bless you
and your service to this country.

1121
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:45,900
You're a doctor?

1122
01:22:46,610 --> 01:22:47,700
Heh.

1123
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,540
I was earlier tonight.

1124
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:54,680
I always wanted to be a doctor.

1125
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:57,980
Instead, I can do...

1126
01:22:58,050 --> 01:22:59,450
this.

1127
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:03,390
Ohh. Useless talent number 66.

1128
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:08,690
I'm very pliable.

1129
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:10,390
A girlfriend of mine
had a theory.

1130
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:13,900
She said at some point in your life,

1131
01:23:13,970 --> 01:23:17,160
you find a use for every useless talent
you ever had.

1132
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:20,200
It's like, uh, connecting the dots.

1133
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:22,610
I'm not that optimistic.

1134
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:26,240
I feel like I'm sinking down the drain
and I can't get out.

1135
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:27,580
She'd say...

1136
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:30,420
when you're stuck in that spiral...

1137
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:32,780
you reach up.

1138
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:36,490
What if there's nothing up there?

1139
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:39,120
Just reach up.

1140
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,190
You're a dancer.

1141
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:44,760
I was earlier tonight.

1142
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:47,430
Well, I'm pulling you out of retirement!

1143
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:52,230
Get your ass up!

1144
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:57,630
Now, I'm starved for entertainment, baby,
and that means you.

1145
01:23:57,710 --> 01:23:58,700

1146
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:03,440

That's what I'm talkin' about.

1150
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:15,990

1151
01:24:17,630 --> 01:24:19,100

but ain't never seen me

1155
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:32,540
I have seen me a stripper

1156
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:35,580

You thought it was pretty funny,
didn't you?

1168
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:23,350
Actually, yes.

1169
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:25,400
You gave me some wood,

1170
01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:27,460
now I'm gonna give you...

1171
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:30,560

Ahh!

01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,640
The gas! You need your gas!

1175
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:47,780
No! Fuck the gas, fuck it.

1176
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:50,290
I'm just gonna have to make this quick.

1177
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:03,000
Aah!

1178
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:04,300
Uhh!

Where'd you get that?

01:26:06,410 --> 01:26:08,530
Useless talent number 37.

Aaaaah!

01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:33,290
Uhh! Uhh!

1183
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,700
I broke my leg.

1184
01:26:36,770 --> 01:26:39,500
That's okay.
I made you something.

1185
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,370
I do believe in you.

1186
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:46,610
Always have.

1187
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:49,270
I believe that you could be better.

1188
01:26:49,350 --> 01:26:51,650
You deserve better,

1189
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,380
even better than me.

1190
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:55,480
Right now,

1191
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:57,490
I need you to become...

1192
01:26:58,530 --> 01:27:00,650
who you're meant to be.

1193
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,760
Stand.

1194
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:10,670
I'd stand clear if I were you.

1195
01:27:17,010 --> 01:27:19,140
Open that door, will you, baby?

1196
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:34,590
Uhh!

1197
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:49,470
They've destroyed most of the tanks.

1198
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:52,840
Any that are left
we'll get on our way to the helicopters.

1199
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:55,140
There are two helicopters,

1200
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:57,240
big enough to take all of us.

1201
01:27:58,690 --> 01:27:59,810
Who can fly?

1202
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,360
Can anyone else fly a helicopter?

1203
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:07,020
I can fly, but...

1204
01:28:07,090 --> 01:28:09,060
no way in hell I'm gonna fly tonight.

1205
01:28:09,130 --> 01:28:10,930
Okay. Cool.

1206
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:12,260
I'll fly.

1207
01:28:13,570 --> 01:28:14,760
Let's go.

1208
01:28:20,910 --> 01:28:22,700
I think we're gonna stay here, Wray.

1209
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:25,751
You'll take care of this for me,
then, Sheriff?

1210
01:28:26,910 --> 01:28:28,570
With pleasure.

1211
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:29,910
Three minutes.

1212
01:28:30,850 --> 01:28:33,010
Your brother's a good man, J.T.

1213
01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:34,680
Best in Texas.

1214
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,050
Hop on.

1215
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:43,730
No, the other way.

1216
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:45,090
Oh.

1217
01:28:47,730 --> 01:28:50,290
No. The other way.

1218
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:39,920
The helicopters are
on the other side of this wall.

1219
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:48,160
We make a run for it!

1220
01:29:48,230 --> 01:29:51,390
No! If we all get killed,
there's no stopping this plague.

1221
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:52,730
Don't you get it?

1222
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:55,320
We're the antidote.

1223
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:56,890
Well, is there another way around?

1224
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,900
Wait here.

1225
01:30:25,130 --> 01:30:28,970
I don't suppose there are any other
biochemical engineers around? Heh.

1226
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:30,700
Take that as a no.

1227
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:34,300
We have to get over that wall!

1228
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:40,880
I was thinkin' we could build us
a new place,

1229
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:43,070
right there where the old one was.

1230
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:45,510
You cook,

1231
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:47,210
I work the back.

1232
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:51,790
You don't make that rent
so goddamn high.

1233
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:55,190
We share the recipe,
we share the rent.

1234
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:02,630
Start at 250 degrees.

1235
01:31:05,870 --> 01:31:07,360
I knew it.

1236
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,910
For how long?

1237
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:11,380
- 12 pounds?
- Sure.

1238
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,640
12 pounds, 12 hours.

1239
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:15,810
Wrapped in tin foil, right?

1240
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:18,010
I don't use no goddamn foil.

1241
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,110
Damn.

1242
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:21,450
Tomatoes? Fresh?

1243
01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:23,850
Canned.

1244
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,580
- No shit?
- Yeah.

1245
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:26,890
You score me some?

1246
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:28,480
Oh, yeah.

1247
01:31:28,590 --> 01:31:30,560
'Cause we're brothers.

1248
01:31:32,230 --> 01:31:34,390
Thank you for this.

1249
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:36,030
You just remember...

1250
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:39,000
you got to take this recipe
to your grave.

1251
01:31:39,110 --> 01:31:43,270
I think I can...
goddamn guarantee that.

1252
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:09,790
That's our cue.

1253
01:32:12,170 --> 01:32:13,830
Cherry, darling...

1254
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:17,070
it's all you.

1255
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:49,670
Let's go!

1256
01:33:54,940 --> 01:33:56,640
Aah!

1257
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:58,800
Wray!

1258
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:03,680
Damn it, Wray.

1259
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:04,980
Ohh.

1260
01:34:06,190 --> 01:34:09,280
Okay. You need to get up
'cause we're leaving.

1261
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:36,280
They told me I'd find you here.

1262
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:42,520
I was beginning to lose hope.

1263
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:44,390
I'm sorry...

1264
01:34:45,530 --> 01:34:47,190
but I lied.

1265
01:34:49,630 --> 01:34:53,220
I did want to hurt you.

1266
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:56,730
My turn.

1267
01:35:07,150 --> 01:35:10,840
No more dead bodies
for Daddy tonight.

1268
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:14,910
Never did like that son of a bitch.

1269
01:35:16,690 --> 01:35:20,990
About as useless
as a pecker on a pope.

1270
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:28,360
Don't touch anything.

1271
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:29,730
I want to fly it.

1272
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:32,030
- He said not to touch anything!
- You don't know what you're doing!

1273
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:33,330
- I do know what I'm doing!
- No, you don't!

1274
01:35:33,410 --> 01:35:35,670
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Shut up, sit down...

1275
01:35:35,740 --> 01:35:37,540
and don't fuckin' touch anything!

1276
01:35:44,050 --> 01:35:45,180
Everybody sit down!

1277
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:53,550
Whoo!

1278
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:57,060
Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
R-r-r-r-rah-ha!

1279
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:02,960
Hit the wipers.

1280
01:36:08,770 --> 01:36:10,300
Go on, leave me.

1281
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:13,040
I am not leaving you here like this.

1282
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:16,010
Motherfuckers around here
eat road kill.

1283
01:36:17,820 --> 01:36:20,480
See? I'm funny.

1284
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:22,850
I made you laugh.

1285
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:24,080
Go to the ocean.

1286
01:36:24,190 --> 01:36:27,220
Put your backs to it.
Protect yourselves there.

1287
01:36:27,290 --> 01:36:29,990
I'm not leaving you, Wray.

1288
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:33,360
It's two against the world.

1289
01:36:34,630 --> 01:36:36,230
It will be.

1290
01:36:37,740 --> 01:36:39,140
I promise.

1291
01:36:39,970 --> 01:36:41,770
I never miss.

1292
01:36:43,210 --> 01:36:45,010
Don't worry, baby.

1293
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:47,910
You'll find your way.

1294
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:06,420
Reach up!

1295
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:20,710
Reach up!

1296
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:09,460
It's like you said
it would be, Wray.

1297
01:38:11,530 --> 01:38:14,120
I'm like you said I would be.

1298
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:15,860
I find the lost...

1299
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:18,130
the weary...

1300
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,430
those that have no hope.

1301
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:24,500
I find them and I lead them...

1302
01:38:25,510 --> 01:38:28,000
to a land we've made for ourselves.

1303
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:31,350
The land by the sea.

1304
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:07,480
It's beautiful.

1305
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:10,890
She's beautiful.

1306
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:16,520
I wish you could see us, us two.

1307
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:19,360
It's like you said it would be.

1308
01:39:20,630 --> 01:39:22,660
Two against the world, baby.

1309
01:39:23,570 --> 01:39:25,370
