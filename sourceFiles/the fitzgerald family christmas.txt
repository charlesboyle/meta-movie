5
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,288
Hello?

6
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,801
Jesus, Dad. What are you doing
calling the house line?

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,200
Mom could have picked up.

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,845
No, I do not have any news yet.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,490
- Gerald, is that for me?
- No, Mom.

10
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,529
Mom, don't worry about it,
it's for me.

11
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,847
Look, I'm having everybody
come over the house tonight

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,121
to celebrate Mom's birthday,
all right?

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,884
And then we're gonna discuss it then.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,081
Oh, you got her a birthday gift.

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,924
Well, that's a first.
What was it?

16
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,202
Oh, that. No, no, no,
actually she did tell me about that.

17
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,725
Your wedding video.

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,089
Yeah, and what, you thought that was
somehow gonna help your cause?

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,769
Look, why don't you come by
the restaurant tomorrow and...

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,210
I'll let you know what
everyone decides tonight.

21
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,525
But, Dad... Yeah. No, I know.

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,081
But please,
don't get your hopes up, okay?

23
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,849
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

24
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,200
And how many times do I have to
tell you, I don't want a party.

25
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,011
Would you please stop fighting this,
you crazy old woman.

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,850
All right?
It's already done, it's organized.

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,486
Everyone is going to be here
except Cyril.

28
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,325
But he'll be home for Christmas,

29
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,447
- right?
- Yes.

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,409
I already told you
he's coming in tomorrow.

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,050
And he's better?

32
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,406
I don't know.
He says he is.

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,324
So we shall see.

34
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,801
And you're picking him up
at Port Authority, right?

35
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,530
Because he will need
someone there for him.

36
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,882
Yes, Mom.
For the 10th time.

37
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,405
- I will pick him up.
- All right, all right.

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,568
Don't get yourself all worked up.

39
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,451
I'm just double checking.
He is my baby after all.

40
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,365
Look, Mom, I don't want you
to worry about this. All right?

41
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,681
I already spoke to all of them

42
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,490
and they're all very excited
to get out here.

43
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,086
Don't try to bullshit me, Gerry.
They're my kids.

44
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,726
Yeah, well, look, whether they like it
or not, they're coming out.

45
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,803
I told you I don't want you
to make a big deal out of this.

46
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,247
Would you just stop
complaining about this?

47
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,164
All right? Look.

48
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,731
Dottie's gonna cook
you a nice dinner.

49
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,166
Connie's gonna bake you a cake.

50
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,085
And Quinn said he's gonna come out
this afternoon to take you shopping.

51
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,083
So why can't you just enjoy yourself?

52
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,130
Okay. Okay, what's really
going on here?

53
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,170
Nothing is going on.
It's your 70th birthday.

54
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,891
I just thought you might like
to have all your kids around

55
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,201
to celebrate with you.

56
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,724
Enjoy your French toast.

57
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,006
Gerald.

58
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,607
What?

59
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,205
What are you not telling me?

60
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,488
Look, there's something I just want
to discuss with the whole family and...

61
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,085
I thought it would be good
if we're all together

62
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,770
so we could all weigh in on it.

63
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,922
And it has to be done
before Christmas.

64
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,281
Did you make
the reservations for tonight?

65
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,407
Mmm.

66
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,971
Did we get the same room
at the lodge?

67
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,246
Quinn, she's too young for you.

68
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,046
What do you care how old she is?

69
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,124
Well, because it kinda makes you
like a creepy old man.

70
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,645
You know, I'm not old enough
to be creepy yet.

71
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,211
Oh, yeah, you are.

72
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,885
- Did you get the same room?
- Yes.

73
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,962
Where's the ring?

74
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,201
It's at my desk.

75
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,085
QF Design.

76
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,001
Yeah. Hold on.

77
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,325
It's your brother.

78
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,604
Um, gonna have to say I'm not here.

79
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,683
Yeah, but I'm not gonna lie for you.

80
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,205
Take the call.

81
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,482
Yo!

82
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,880
Hey, Fitzy, where are you?

83
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,008
You just called me at the office,

84
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,366
and I'm trying to get out of here.

85
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,211
Oh, okay, good. Then you should
be out here soon, right?

86
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,930
Change of plan, my man.

87
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,930
I'm taking Abbie up to the Adirondacks
for the weekend.

88
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,004
Got some serious plans in place.

89
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,130
You don't think you can
just stop by for an hour?

90
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,045
All right, then we can show all this off
to your latest flame.

91
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,046
Hey, Gerry.
This is more than a flame.

92
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,488
Well, even more of a reason
to stop by then, right?

93
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,411
All right. I'll see what I can do,
but no promises.

94
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,409
Look, you don't have to
promise me shit, all right.

95
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,408
It's not my birthday.

96
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,170
Just the woman that brought you
into this world.

97
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,170
See what you can do.

98
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,651
Oh, no.
Don't stop, don't stop.

99
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,082
No, it's not for you. It's not for you.
It's the neighbor.

100
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,605
I gotta see.

101
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,524
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

102
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,403
Oh, shit, it's my brother.

103
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,200
- Stay. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

104
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,088
What is this, Gerry?

105
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,605
What the hell are you doing here?

106
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,886
What do you mean
what am I doing here?

107
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,769
I got the supplies
for Mom's party tonight.

108
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,126
Oh, shit.

109
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,247
Oh.

110
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,169
Gerry, I can't host
the party tonight.

111
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,930
What do you mean you can't
host the party? Why not?

112
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,082
I'm having all this trouble
with the boys.

113
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,611
They're in trouble up at school,

114
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,205
and they're not even coming home
for Christmas.

115
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,567
So, I...
I gotta deal with them.

116
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,927
All right. So what does that have
to do with Mom's party?

117
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,089
Okay, um, there's something else.

118
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,084
I... I was waiting
to tell the family, but...

119
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,005
Skippy and I split up.
Like, three weeks ago.

120
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,367
I know, because Skippy
was in the bar a couple of nights ago

121
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,124
telling me all about it,
crying on my shoulder.

122
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,762
He also told me that you've been
having an affair for six months.

123
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,611
Yes, I...

124
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,969
I've been seeing someone
and, um...

125
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,646
You know, Skippy and I
tried to work it out, but it's just...

126
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,687
It's not gonna happen.

127
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,968
Who are you having
an affair with?

128
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,249
Do you remember, um,
Jimmy Esposito's little brother Johnny?

129
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,761
Johnny Esposito, the gardener's kid?
How old is he?

130
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,208
Uh, I don't know. 20s...
maybe 30s.

131
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,011
How did you end up hooking up
with Johnny Esposito?

132
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,363
- He cuts my grass.
- He cuts your grass.

133
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,565
That's fantastic.

134
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,245
Hey, Sharon.
How about I just pop out

135
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,323
and drop you at your mom's
on my way to East Hampton?

136
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,005
No, you don't have to do that.

137
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,161
Not a big deal.

138
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,527
I'm just gonna take the train
or I'll call my brother or something.

139
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,647
Not the brother that I met?

140
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,411
No, that's Gerry. He's an asshole.
I'll call Quinn.

141
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,850
I wouldn't mind just, like, taking you.
I could see the house.

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,843
I could meet your mom,
say "Happy birthday."

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,128
No, that's definitely
not happening.

144
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,284
I haven't brought a boy home
since my junior prom date.

145
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,369
- I learned my lesson then.
- Wow, luckily I'm not a boy, honey.

146
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,522
Promise you I'll do better
than your junior prom date.

147
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,362
All right.

148
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,209
So...why don't we do that?

149
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,441
Do what?

150
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,410
I'll drop you off.
Meet some of the brood.

151
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,848
No, you're not seriously asking
to come meet my family today.

152
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,011
Are you?

153
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,645
Is that such a bad thing?

154
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,290
No, I just... I didn't think
we were, you know...

155
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,886
at the meet-the-family place yet.

156
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,690
I mean, I'm having fun
and you're having fun right now...

157
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,366
Yeah, I'm having fun.
I didn't mean to make it so complicated.

158
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,800
- Good.
- It's fun, it's good.

159
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,246
- Okay, good.
- Yeah, that's fine.

160
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,965
- Great.
- Call your bro.

161
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,923
Hey, Erin, the house
looks real festive.

162
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,923
Perfect place for a party tonight.

163
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,685
We can't have everybody over here.

164
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,285
I have to put the baby down at 7:30.

165
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,922
Mom said that she wanted to celebrate
at one of her girls' houses.

166
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,726
Now I've explained to you
why we can't do it at Dot's.

167
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,041
Connie's place is too small,

168
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,407
Sharon's apartment in the city
is obviously not an option.

169
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,641
So that leaves you.

170
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,245
Well, we can't do it here.

171
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,607
And could you keep
your voice down? The baby's sleeping.

172
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,808
I don't understand
why no one seems to think

173
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,088
that their mother's birthday
is a big deal.

174
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,766
Because she deals with you one way
and the rest of us another way.

175
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,365
You're the golden boy,
you can do no wrong.

176
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,806
She treats the rest of us like shit.

177
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,962
- I hope you know that that is total bullshit.
- Is it?

178
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,406
Do you know
she actually suggested

179
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,967
that I let her sneak the baby out
one day and get him baptized.

180
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,929
Yeah, she told me
and I think it's genius.

181
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,605
We're not baptizing the baby.

182
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,647
Why not?

183
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,370
Because Corey's Jewish.

184
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,329
I thought Corey's an atheist.

185
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,369
- He's still Jewish.
- Look,

186
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,842
just let Mom take the kid
up to church and have her do it.

187
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,209
You don't need to participate,
Corey doesn't need to know about it,

188
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,328
and that way the kid
is not stuck in Limbo

189
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,721
in case you two heathens
are wrong.

190
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,684
You're all crazy.

191
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,008
We're crazy? You're telling me
you're an atheist.

192
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,525
How do you explain
the Christmas tree?

193
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,763
We have a kid now. Where else
am I gonna put the presents?

194
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,211
Why don't you
just blow this thing off?

195
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,964
You know what?
That is not a bad idea.

196
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,406
Sharon,
it's your mom's birthday.

197
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,806
You gotta stop in for a drink
at least.

198
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,930
Oh, no. There is no just stopping in
for one drink with my family.

199
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,047
Yeah, that's true.

200
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,964
And let's all be made aware
if we go there at all,

201
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,167
we're gonna be there all night.

202
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,805
So let's not go.

203
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,769
The less I have to deal with Gerry,
the better.

204
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,410
What is this beef with Gerry?

205
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,962
I'm just... I'm tired of him pretending
he's the patriarch of our family.

206
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,605
First of all,
he's not my freakin' father.

207
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,489
And second of all,
he's hardly qualified for the job.

208
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,483
He's a grown man
and he still lives at home.

209
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,371
You know with fairness to him,
he's got his reasons for that.

210
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,205
Whatever. The point is,

211
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,930
if I don't have to go to
Mom's house tonight,

212
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,650
I am more than okay with that.

213
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,401
I have an idea.
Why don't Sharon and, um...

214
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,721
I'm sorry,
what was your name again?

215
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,690
Francis Xavier,
but my friends call me FX.

216
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,241
- Oh, okay. I like that. It's a good name.
- Thank you.

217
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,721
So why don't Sharon and FX

218
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,167
come upstate with us,
get a room at the same hotel.

219
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,970
We'll get dinner,
hang out for the weekend,

220
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,770
and we'll drive back
Christmas morning.

221
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,648
Honey, you know,
it's really not a great idea.

222
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,847
It's not considerate.

223
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,002
Sharon doesn't ski.
It's a ski resort.

224
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,042
Neither do I.

225
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,167
You don't ski?

226
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,527
You know I got an idea.

227
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,364
I'm headed out to East Hampton
this weekend.

228
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,202
You guys want to come with me,
you're more than welcome.

229
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,211
I've never been to the Hamptons.
That sounds awesome.

230
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,362
Does it sound awesome?

231
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,521
Yeah. Big time.

232
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,523
Oh, well, you gotta come then.
You're gonna love it.

233
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,210
What do you think, babe?
I got plenty of room.

234
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,363
Ah, as long as we're all agreed
that we don't have to go to Mom's,

235
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,885
I mean, I'm up for whatever.

236
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,603
- Babe, that sounds like so much fun.
-Mmm.

237
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,444
Please?
I don't wanna go skiing.

238
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,805
But I want to be with you.

239
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,482
Okay, fine.

240
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,406
But you're calling Mom.

241
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,087
Hey!

242
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,363
Hey, Mom. Happy birthday.

243
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,931
Hey, Sharon!

244
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,764
Oh, am I gonna see you tonight?

245
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,928
Yeah, you know,
that's what I was calling about.

246
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,082
You know, there must have been
some sort of misunderstanding

247
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,082
with Gerry or something.

248
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,129
I didn't know he wanted us
to come out tonight for a party

249
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,725
and then also again
at Christmas.

250
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,802
That's what I thought.

251
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,122
But you know Gerry wants to
make a big deal out of it.

252
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,602
Yeah, but it's not a big deal
to you, though, right?

253
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,003
Well, I mean,
it is my 70th but...

254
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,766
Well, you know how I feel
about birthdays, right?

255
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,127
Yeah, yeah. See that's what I thought,
that's what I told Quinn.

256
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,926
I mean, he had these plans
and then he invited me, so...

257
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,401
- So Quinn's not coming either?
- No. But...

258
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,767
we'll both be out at Christmas.
Like we always do, you know.

259
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,206
And we'll celebrate
your birthday then.

260
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,364
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
We'll--We'll do it then.

261
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,443
Okay, great.
I'm so glad you're cool with it.

262
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,206
- Look, I gotta go, Mom. I love you.
- I love you, Mom.

263
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,407
Happy birthday.

264
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,403
I love you both.
Love you, too.

265
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,641
Bye.

266
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,921
Okay, bye.

267
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,241
- We're good?
- We are so good.

268
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,322
Let's go.

269
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,881
Hmm.

270
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,724
Hey, Mom. You home?

271
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,928
Oh, I'm upstairs, Gerry.

272
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,003
Little change in plans.

273
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,646
We're gonna do the party here
tonight instead.

274
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,165
Okay? I already called
the restaurant,

275
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,600
and they're gonna bring over
a bunch of food.

276
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,524
The food is terrible.

277
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,409
And the takeout is even worse.

278
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,769
Oh, really? Is it? Then why do you
insist on eating there every night?

279
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,331
Because it's free.

280
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,686
And otherwise,
I'd have to eat alone.

281
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,161
But what is Dottie's problem?
I mean, why...

282
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,446
Why isn't she cooking?

283
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,331
Dottie has more drama
going on like always.

284
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,084
- But she's coming over?
- No. No.

285
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,323
And neither is Erin. I guess she has
her hands full with the baby.

286
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,201
Well, uh, Sharon and Quinn
have blown us off as well.

287
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,850
Apparently,
they made other plans.

288
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,126
Are you kidding me?

289
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,523
I spoke to Quinn earlier today
and he said he was coming.

290
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,682
Ah, you know what? I'm gonna call
that son of a bitch right now

291
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,569
and make sure they
get their <i>asses</i> out here.

292
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,960
No, no, no, don't do that.

293
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,327
No, it's--it's...
Hon, I'm fine.

294
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,926
Listen, when you have a birthday
two days before Christmas,

295
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,844
you get used to
eating your cake alone.

296
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,207
Mom, you're not eating
your cake alone.

297
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,326
I will, uh...
I'll be right back, all right?

298
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,966
Hey! Can I help you?

299
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,043
Yeah, I'm Gerry Fitzgerald.

300
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,363
I'm an old friend
of Mrs. McGowan's.

301
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,966
Just wanted to stop by,
wish her a happy holiday.

302
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,201
Oh, yeah, yeah.

303
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,091
Um, I'm Nora, I'm one of her nurses.
Come on in.

304
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,484
Nancy?

305
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,644
Oh, Gerry.
It's so good to see you.

306
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,086
Oh, yeah.

307
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,806
Oh, you want a drink?
Nora, get this boy a drink.

308
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,200
Oh, yeah.
What do you want?

309
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,806
No, actually I'm all right.
Thank you.

310
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,246
Okay.

311
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,089
So how are you?

312
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,006
Well...you know.
The holidays are hard.

313
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,571
Well, look,
that's why I'm here today.

314
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,768
I'm gonna invite you over the house
tonight for Rosie's birthday.

315
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,883
I know she would
love to see you.

316
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,042
Oh, no. I don't think so.

317
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,762
I don't have the strength these days
to leave the house.

318
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,321
But I'll call her,
I'll wish her a happy birthday.

319
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,565
Yeah, she would love
to hear from you.

320
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,041
And I'm gonna make sure
that she gets over here on Christmas Day

321
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,725
to at least stop by and say hello.

322
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,609
Oh, I don't know about that.

323
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,286
I got a phone call from your father.

324
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,682
Really?

325
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,888
- Mm-hmm.
- This guy is unbelievable.

326
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,247
- What did you say?
- I told him

327
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,606
there's not a shot in hell

328
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,240
that she is gonna let him
into that house again.

329
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,164
Especially, at Christmas?

330
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,608
I know. I told him the same thing
but he is insisting,

331
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,081
so tonight
we'll see what she decides.

332
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,605
What do you think
that she should do?

333
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,444
What do you think
in your heart?

334
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,090
- It's Christmas.
- Yeah.

335
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,322
If ever there was a time
for some forgiveness...

336
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,720
And mercy.

337
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,881
You're not gonna believe this.

338
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,610
I got this card from my sister,

339
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,808
and it just made me think
of this whole situation.

340
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,086
Just listen to this.

341
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,801
"Lost friend, lost child,
lost parent, sister, brother,

342
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,405
"husband, wife,

343
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,528
"in the season of immortal hope

344
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,127
"and on the birthday
of immortal mercy

345
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,721
we will shut out nothing."

346
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,322
Mr. Charles Dickens.

347
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,970
Great sentiment.

348
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,845
But I think you know how my mother
feels about the English, right?

349
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,366
Now go.

350
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,726
Let me know
how it all turns out.

351
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,888
Will do. Great to see you.

352
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,326
All right.

353
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,126
Try to have a good holiday.

354
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,361
I'm trying.

355
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,006
Well, look, how is she doing?

356
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,366
She's good, she's good.

357
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,291
I think the holidays get her
a little down sometimes.

358
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,206
You know, I used to come by
and visit all the time but...

359
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,482
I guess I gotta
make more of an effort.

360
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,369
- Yeah, that would mean a lot to her.
- Yeah.

361
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,806
You should definitely visit.

362
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,370
All right, and, um...

363
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,763
What's your deal?
You're here with her all the time or...?

364
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,763
Yeah, yeah. Definitely.

365
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,606
So, so if you come visit,
I'll see you.

366
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,886
All right, great.

367
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,486
- I will definitely do that then.
- All right. Okay.

368
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,291
Uh, Mrs. G, happy holidays.

369
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,886
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

370
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,850
I might come by again,
maybe, uh, tomorrow.

371
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,161
Just check in on you.

372
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,288
All right,
see you tomorrow.

373
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,926
- All right.
- Okay.

374
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,650
- Good to meet you.
- You, too.

375
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,881
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

376
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,562
Hey, baby.
How did it go?

377
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,370
It didn't.

378
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,284
What happened?

379
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,566
I thought it was a done deal.

380
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,006
So did I.

381
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,281
What did they say?

382
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,566
They didn't say shit.

383
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,246
They just don't have any spots
open, that's it.

384
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,731
I don't understand,
I thought your brothers...

385
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,921
Oh, what does it matter
what happened?

386
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,924
The point is that they have no work,
end of story.

387
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,764
Let's go inside, have a beer
and get ready to go to my mom's, huh?

388
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,445
Yeah, I'm not going
to your mom's tonight.

389
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,560
What are you talking about?
It's her birthday, you have to go.

390
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,881
It's bad enough I got to
spend the day

391
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,804
with your asshole brothers
on Christmas.

392
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,084
JJ, why are you being like this?

393
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,449
This is it. This is us.

394
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,603
- Right here's good.
- Oh, my God.

395
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,565
- This house is insane.
- Oh, thank you.

396
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,441
- This is bigger than my college.
- Oh, thanks. Yeah, it's not bad.

397
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,206
No, it's not bad at all.

398
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,811
Oh, no, no. I got it.

399
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,450
Yeah, okay. Is this yours?

400
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,364
I can't believe
how big this house is.

401
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,727
- Ah. Well, let me give you the grand tour.
- Oh, thank you.

402
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,245
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

403
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,925
So, what's this guy do for a living?

404
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,168
I don't know. Nothing.
It's just, uh, family money.

405
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,606
- Family money?
- Yeah.

406
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,524
I'm not familiar with that concept.

407
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,730
So do you have a pool?

408
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,524
Uh, we got a pool and a pond.

409
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,603
Pond's good for you.

410
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,040
- You didn't think I'd know that, did you?
- That's good.

411
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,043
Now come this way, come here.

412
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,122
So, what do you think?

413
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,361
What?

414
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,607
My girl. The girl.

415
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,727
Oh, I think she's great.

416
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,009
Well, I'm glad you approve, 'cause
I'm gonna propose this weekend.

417
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,401
Pr-Propose what?

418
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,800
Propose marriage.

419
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,246
What?

420
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,210
Really?
You just met her, didn't you?

421
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,761
Yeah, but I'm gonna propose
tomorrow night, Christmas Eve.

422
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,888
What is she,
like, 12 years old?

423
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,606
You should talk, you and
Money Bags Methuselah over here.

424
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,685
Yeah, true, but I'm not looking
to get married, far from it.

425
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,487
You know, when baby's all growsed up,
you're gonna realize.

426
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,130
When you know, you know.

427
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,611
Hey, guys. Come on up.

428
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,167
- Hello?
- Hey, Mom.

429
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,846
So I have some bad news.

430
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,809
I'm not gonna be able
to come over tonight.

431
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,246
What's wrong?

432
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,601
Are you crying?

433
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,762
No, no. No, I just, uh...

434
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,287
I bought you a cake and I'm not
gonna be able to bring it over,

435
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,885
so I feel bad.

436
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,929
I don't care about the cake.

437
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,406
Why are you crying?

438
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,006
It's nothing. It's just, uh...

439
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,289
Uh, JJ didn't get that job so...

440
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,489
Look, look, baby.
Why don't you come over and--

441
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,769
and stay with me tonight.
Okay?

442
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,727
No, I should stay here.
I'll, uh, I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay?

443
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,370
Have a happy birthday.

444
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,803
Well, looks like
it's just you and me, kid.

445
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,644
So I heard.

446
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,485
Look, Mom, the reason that I wanted
everybody out here tonight--

447
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,881
and for the record,
I am furious with all of them--

448
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,726
was, there is something the family
needs to make a joint decision about.

449
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,961
Then we'll discuss it at Christmas.

450
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,130
Nah, it can't wait till then.
It's...

451
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,611
It's about Dad.

452
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,489
What about Dad?

453
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,283
Well, he wants to spend Christmas
with us here at the house.

454
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,448
Gerry, as I told him

455
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,650
when he walked out on me,
on us, 20 years ago,

456
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,848
the man will never set foot
in this house again.

457
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,889
I know, I know.

458
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,965
But in his defense, all right,
he has had a pretty tough year.

459
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,690
Yeah, and I've had a tough life.

460
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,808
Mom, his company went belly-up.

461
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,371
I mean, he lost almost everything.

462
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,841
Good, good. I'm glad.
He deserves it.

463
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,968
Yeah. Well, then you'll love to hear

464
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,801
that his divorce with Carol
got real nasty and...

465
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,486
Now that is a birthday gift.

466
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,689
I'm gonna celebrate with a beer.

467
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,410
So, you're not even gonna
consider it,

468
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,527
- are you?
- Nah.

469
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,489
What about the Christmas spirit?

470
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,327
Why don't you just give it
a little bit of time,

471
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,324
think about it
and then make a decision.

472
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,686
- Okay.
- All right.

473
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,729
- I'll think about it.
- Good.

474
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,884
Okay,
I've thought about it.

475
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,168
And the answer is still no.

476
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,964
Now that that's settled,

477
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,321
I think you should go down
to the restaurant and check on things.

478
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,324
The restaurant can wait.
Come on, it's your birthday.

479
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,246
I appreciate everything
you're doing, Gerry.

480
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,210
But I'm not asking you.
I'm telling you.

481
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,530
Okay.

482
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,920
I got it.

483
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,289
Happy birthday, gorgeous.

484
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,326
- Hey, Brian.
- Hey. What's up, Gerr?

485
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,602
KK, how we doing tonight?

486
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,603
Eh, pretty quiet,
given it's the holidays.

487
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,330
But that's to be expected.

488
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,529
All right. Well, look, maybe we'll, uh,
close up early tonight, all right?

489
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,567
Sounds good.

490
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,449
I'll be in the office if you need me.

491
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,686
Oh, yeah, and, KK,

492
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,451
if my mom calls make sure
you put the call through, all right?

493
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,204
No problem, Gerr.

494
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,810
- Hey!
- Hey!

495
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,610
- I know you.
- Yeah, yeah.

496
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,762
- How are you?
- I'm good. Thank you for asking.

497
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,126
Good. Gerry.
We have met.

498
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,248
Right. Nora.
I'm Mrs. McGowan's nurse.

499
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,487
- Of course.
- She, uh...

500
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,805
said I should just stop by
while I'm waiting for my train.

501
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,200
- Speaks highly of the joint.
- Oh.

502
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,050
Well, what time is your train?

503
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,083
- Oh, in 10 minutes from now. So, yeah...
- Oh, shit.

504
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,805
I know, I've been here for a while.

505
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,008
Well, you know they run every hour.

506
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,326
They do.

507
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,482
So if you wanted
to catch the next one

508
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,440
maybe you could stay
and you could have a drink?

509
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,125
Thought you'd never ask.

510
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,449
It was complete insanity.

511
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,840
Because you gotta remember

512
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,287
we had nine people living
in a three-bedroom house.

513
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,283
Good Lord.
Bloody Irish.

514
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,011
So actually it was
a good thing that our father left.

515
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,810
We really needed the extra space.

516
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,884
Whoa, back up. You shared a room
with three of your sisters?

517
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,724
Yeah. Four sisters in a room

518
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,360
about the size of this coffee table
right here.

519
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,726
And our oldest sister Dottie,

520
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,008
she used to bring her boyfriends
back from college

521
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,049
and have sex
with them in the room,

522
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,765
while we were all there sleeping.

523
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,126
- Did she really?
- Yeah.

524
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,009
- I never heard that.
- Yeah, she did.

525
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,531
And I've got the emotional scars
to prove it.

526
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,170
You know I'd like to meet
this sister of yours.

527
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,800
No, I don't think you would.
She's over 30.

528
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,007
Stop it.

529
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,685
Anyway, meanwhile,
this whole time

530
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,882
the boys have the big room
all to themselves.

531
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,168
You sound particularly resentful
when you say that.

532
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,481
We deserved it.

533
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,170
What did you do to deserve it?

534
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,731
- They were boys, lass.
- That's right.

535
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,565
It's exactly correct.
Thank you, Francis Xavier.

536
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,051
Man who understands.

537
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,441
And for a while it was just
me and Gerry in the room.

538
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,967
Then Gerry moved to the basement
when the baby came along.

539
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,360
The baby became Cyril,

540
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,363
who became my indentured
servant till I went to college.

541
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,727
Yeah, and maybe that's
why C turned out the way he did.

542
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,530
I have to admit.
I was not very kind to the little guy.

543
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,047
- You were terrible to him.
- He was my little brother.

544
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,249
It was my duty to abuse him
at all times.

545
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,686
Yeah, I beat the crap out
of my little brother

546
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,682
- every day of his life.
- Of course you did.

547
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,683
So just all older brothers are assholes.

548
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,087
- No, little brothers are punks.
- You know I'd take offense at that.

549
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,526
I was never an asshole to you.

550
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,489
Oh, my God. I'm not even
talking about you, Quinn.

551
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,085
Well, it's clear
who you are talking about.

552
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,890
So would you give me
a little more detail

553
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,202
as to what Gerry did
to piss you off so much?

554
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,407
I don't even wanna talk about it.

555
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,891
- He told her he didn't approve...
- It's not even worth going into.

556
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,644
- Of her dating a...
- It's not.

557
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,961
...dashingly handsome,

558
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,566
- materialistically wealthy...
- No, that's not what he said.

559
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,522
- Slightly older gentleman.
- He said something more to the effect of,

560
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,365
"Why are you dating
that old fucking creep anyhow?"

561
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,646
Oh, that would piss me off.

562
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,961
Wait a second.
He called me a fucking creep?

563
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,884
Yeah, I didn't want to go into it.

564
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,724
That doesn't sound like Gerry.

565
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,405
I've always dated much younger women.

566
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,085
He never said anything like that to me.

567
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,123
Yeah, that's called
a double standard.

568
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,167
Too much information.

569
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,970
Don't want to know about
all the women you've dated.

570
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,002
Just don't...

571
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,447
- You've only dated younger women?
- Yeah.

572
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,405
How old are you, Abbie?

573
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,087
- 22.
- Really?

574
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,129
Wow. Sweet.

575
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,969
You are a fucking creep.

576
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,203
Stay over there, my friend.

577
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,847
Okay. Here's Mr. Whale.

578
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,647
Took forever.

579
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,643
- Is he down?
- Finally.

580
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,764
How come you don't want
to go to your mother's tonight?

581
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,041
We could have called a babysitter.

582
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,611
'Cause she drives me crazy.

583
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,966
In fact they all drive me crazy.

584
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,690
Besides we're gonna see them
on Christmas.

585
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,768
Speaking of Christmas,
I was wondering...

586
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,365
Oh! Oh, God!

587
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,443
Can... I can't deal with it.
Can you...

588
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,210
- I got it, I got it.
- try?

589
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,131
JJ?

590
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,044
- JJ?
- Hey-.

591
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,406
Hey.

592
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,564
Baby, I'm sorry.

593
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,205
I'm sorry.

594
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,202
Where did you come from?

595
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,283
- Boston.
- Boston?

596
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,442
Boston. So that means you're a...

597
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,409
- Red Sox fan.
- Mm-hmm.

598
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,608
Red Sox, Pats, Celts, yes.

599
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,921
Now, why did you go and do that

600
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,044
and ruin what I thought was
a pretty good thing we got going on here?

601
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,611
What makes you think
this was a good thing?

602
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,326
I'm a little out of practice,

603
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,528
but, yeah, it seems like
it's going pretty well.

604
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,205
You're smiling,
I'm laughing.

605
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,245
Yeah.

606
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,607
Something tells me
you don't laugh very much.

607
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,401
Oh.

608
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,649
Probably not as much
as I used to, I guess.

609
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,770
I take it Mrs. McGowan
told you about me and her daughter.

610
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,251
Yeah.

611
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,965
I'm sorry about that.

612
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,567
Well, that was a pretty shitty day
for a lot of people, right?

613
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,882
I lost my dad on that day, too.

614
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,442
I'm... I'm sorry to hear that.

615
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,246
Yeah.

616
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,802
And she said that you guys were supposed
to get married that October.

617
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:25,290
Look, I don't love talking
about this. If you can...

618
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,442
I get it.
Yeah, yeah.

619
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,645
So, anyhow, what, uh,
what brings you here?

620
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,844
Uh, nursing school and then I just
fell in love with the city.

621
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,126
No, not New York.

622
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,685
What brought you here tonight,

623
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,127
more specifically
to this fine establishment?

624
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,765
Um...

625
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,367
I was waiting for my train.

626
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,330
Well, I got bad news.
You, uh, you missed it.

627
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,164
No, I missed my train?

628
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,890
- It's gone.
- Oh, no.

629
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,286
There's got to be another train.

630
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,611
Not tonight.

631
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,451
Hmm.

632
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,806
Where do you live?

633
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,411
Whitestone.

634
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,365
It's a long cab ride.

635
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:15,487
Thank you so much for the lift
and walking me to the door.

636
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,928
- You're such a gentleman.
- Yeah, of course. Anytime.

637
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,208
Do you really mean that?
'Cause I work five nights a week

638
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,448
and I hate that train ride.

639
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,250
Yes, I do mean it.

640
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,481
Hmm, that's good.

641
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,881
Look, I had a great time tonight.

642
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,405
I did, too.

643
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,881
You know I could, um...
stick around tonight if you want.

644
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,246
Mmm.

645
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,288
I don't think so.

646
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,205
Did I just totally blow this?

647
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,010
No. No, no, no, no.
I just, you know.

648
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,924
You sure? Yeah.

649
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,765
Just not tonight, I think,
you know.

650
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,524
All right, yeah. Um...

651
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,886
Still I'd, you know...

652
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,565
I meant that I would love
to see you again.

653
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,245
I would love that, too.

654
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,243
- All right, good, good.
- Yeah.

655
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,164
- All right, then.
- Thanks for the drink.

656
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,368
Thanks for the ride and...

657
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,646
- Okay.
- All right.

658
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,404
Okay. Bye.

659
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,606
- Hey!
- Hey!

660
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,125
What are you doing up so early?

661
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,245
I'm always up this early.

662
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,686
- Really?
- What's your excuse?

663
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,410
Yeah, I mean, me, too.

664
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,130
I'm lucky if I get five hours.

665
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,165
You know, that's funny.

666
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,561
I mean,
we're brother and sister

667
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,125
and we don't even
know each other that well.

668
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,727
What?

669
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,120
We know each other fine.

670
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,089
Oh, yeah? Where did I
go to high school?

671
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,126
Sacred Heart.

672
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,521
No, that was Connie and Erin,
the smart ones.

673
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,011
I went to Hewlett.

674
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,685
Where did I go to college?

675
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,842
I know you went upstate.

676
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,001
Oswego?

677
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,402
Oneonta?

678
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,682
You played soccer.

679
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,889
Jesus, that was Cyril.

680
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,122
I went to Purchase.
I was a theater major.

681
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,044
I know all of this.

682
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,565
I'm fucking around with you.

683
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,529
You are so full of shit.

684
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,603
I bet you don't even know
how old I am.

685
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,531
You're 20...

686
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,042
I know you're not 30.

687
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,081
See.

688
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,004
Okay. How old am I?

689
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,481
You just turned 38.
You went to Xavier High School.

690
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,125
You went to Fordham for college.

691
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,964
And of the six books
you have read,

692
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,122
The Old Man and the Sea
is your favorite.

693
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,931
Okay. So you know some things
about me. Congratulations.

694
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,241
I don't know you from Adam.

695
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,408
But you're my baby sister
and I love you to death.

696
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,726
And by the way,

697
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,965
don't pay attention to that bullshit
Gerry gave you about FX.

698
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,451
You don't think
he's too old for me?

699
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,840
Who's to say who's too old?

700
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,647
Is he good to you?

701
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,010
Then he's good with me.

702
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,931
I don't know.

703
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,971
Gerry just...
He made me feel like such a cliché.

704
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,600
You know, like,
girl grows up without a dad

705
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,604
so she dates old guys
just to replace him.

706
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,762
Sharon, give yourself a break.

707
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,686
You're not the only one in this family
with daddy issues.

708
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,361
Yo! C!

709
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,284
Hey, Gerry,
what are you doing here?

710
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,408
How you doin'?
Good to see you.

711
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,927
Figured you could use a friendly face
when you got off the bus.

712
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,764
Thanks. Did you drive in?

713
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,371
I did. I did, you know.

714
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,931
And since we're in the city,

715
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,923
there's a little something
I wanna show you.

716
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,685
Okay? All right?

717
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,887
You're looking good, man.

718
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,451
Yeah, threw in
a couple of pounds.

719
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,961
I think it's good for you.
It's good for you.

720
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,087
Thanks.

721
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,843
So, you recognize
this building?

722
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,331
No. Should I?

723
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,921
Yeah. You know the picture
in the living room of Dad with Grandma

724
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,209
on his First Holy Communion
sitting on a stoop?

725
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,442
- Right there.
- Oh? This is where they used to live.

726
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,806
Yeah. Third floor.

727
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,610
Well, if the stoop could talk
it'd probably tell us

728
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,762
what an asshole Dad was
as a kid.

729
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,561
How do you know
which building it was?

730
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,121
You know, he used to take me
into the city all the time

731
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,122
when I was little.

732
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,089
He wanted to show me
where he grew up,

733
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,082
how he grew up.

734
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,811
Said, "it's important that you know
where the Fitzgeralds are from."

735
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,564
Never did that shit with me.

736
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,041
Well, why do you think
I'm doing it now?

737
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,009
You know, he didn't call me once
when I was up there.

738
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,127
I don't know why
that surprises you.

739
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,487
I mean, I keep trying to tell you guys
he is who he is.

740
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,451
All right? And he's certainly
not gonna change

741
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,647
now that he's in his 70s.

742
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,962
Once a selfish cocksucker,
always a selfish cocksucker, huh?

743
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,167
Yes. Yeah.

744
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,607
You should know, though,
he wants to come out to the house

745
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,046
tomorrow for Christmas,

746
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,440
have dinner with us.

747
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,961
What do you think?

748
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,808
If he's gonna be there,
I'm not gonna be there.

749
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,841
Mom, what are you doing here?

750
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,731
Dottie just called
and she's just busy this morning.

751
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,042
This is so typical of her.
Busy with what?

752
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,044
She didn't say.
She just asked me to cover for her.

753
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,964
She is so irresponsible.

754
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,011
Oh, everyone has their own issues.

755
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,243
Besides,
what's up with you these days?

756
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,721
Doesn't the holidays
put everyone in a shitty mood?

757
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,406
No, it shouldn't.
it should do just the opposite.

758
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,005
Well, it never has for me.

759
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,400
Is it just the holidays

760
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,005
or is there something specific

761
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,571
- got you down in the mouth?
- Mom,

762
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,131
- I'm really not in the mood
- I mean, no...

763
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,248
- to have this talk.
- I look at this beautiful home,

764
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,971
that loving husband,
that gorgeous child,

765
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,886
and I can't imagine what you've got
to be so down in the mouth about.

766
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,964
Yeah? Well, as usual
you don't know half the story.

767
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,009
Well, why don't you
try explaining?

768
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,242
Mom, we don't have
that relationship.

769
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,050
We never did
and we never will.

770
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,168
You don't even want to try?

771
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,846
Consider it the birthday gift
you didn't get me.

772
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,765
Guilt trips, they work
with the others but not me.

773
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,766
- Ah.
- Hey, Rosie.

774
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,082
- You pinch-hitting?
- Hi, Corey, yeah.

775
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,123
- Happy belated birthday.
- Thank you.

776
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,248
Where are you two off to today?

777
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,367
Well, we're gonna
have some lunch,

778
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,648
see the tree, do the whole
Christmas Eve thing.

779
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,929
Aha. Oh, so even though
we don't believe in God

780
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,128
we're still celebrating
Christmas?

781
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,282
Doesn't mean you ever stop
believing in Santa Claus.

782
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,001
You know, Rosie,

783
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,161
today would be the perfect day

784
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,164
for you to do that thing
you asked me about.

785
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,446
- Oh, my...
- Rosie.

786
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,961
If you do it,
don't tell anyone.

787
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,246
Especially this one.

788
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,084
It's between you,
Aaron and God.

789
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,526
- Okay?
- To the grave.

790
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,920
- To the grave.
- So, Mom...

791
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,481
Aaron's down now
and he'll go back down again

792
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,483
- in two to three hours.
- Right. Okay.

793
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:06,248
Now, you two just take your time,
have a great day.

794
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,164
Aaron's in good hands with me.

795
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,367
Oh, I know he is.

796
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,090
You did such a great job
with this one.

797
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,844
I had nothing to do
with raising her.

798
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,371
She raised herself.

799
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,646
Bye!

800
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,244
Father Mike,
it's Rosemary Fitzgerald.

801
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,448
Hey, Mom! Look who's home.

802
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,240
Hey, Mom!

803
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,126
Ma!

804
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,210
Huh.

805
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,528
That's weird.
She must have stepped out.

806
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,445
Uh...

807
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,968
Well, look, the idea was for you
to stay in your old room.

808
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,286
So, you cool with that?

809
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,521
Yeah, of course.

810
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,728
And you're allowed to just
be left here on your own

811
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,723
without any supervision?

812
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,001
I suppose.

813
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,650
Yeah?
Well, what do you think?

814
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,851
- I think I'm good.
- Yeah?

815
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,651
- I don't need to lock up the booze or...
- No.

816
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,571
I'll be okay.

817
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,200
All right, brother.

818
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,691
Look, I got to get up
to the restaurant,

819
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,968
but it was awesome
to see you.

820
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,202
- All right? You're looking good.
- Yeah.

821
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,646
Hey, Gerry...

822
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,322
Can I borrow a couple of bucks?

823
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,809
Look, there's plenty of food
in the fridge and...

824
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,361
No. I want to do some
Christmas shopping.

825
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,323
Yeah, of course. Sorry.

826
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,324
That should cover it.

827
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,687
Thanks.

828
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,762
Hey. And don't worry
about anybody else.

829
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,371
Just get Mom something good.

830
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,487
All right?

831
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,881
She's gonna be excited
to see you, brother.

832
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,240
Welcome home.

833
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,844
I think I'm good.

834
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,009
- Hey.
- Hey. What's going on?

835
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,810
She's asleep.

836
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,440
- Shit. Sorry about that.
- No. It's cool. It's cool.

837
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,443
Come over here.

838
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,965
- How's it going?
- Good. Good.

839
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,531
What are you doing?

840
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,770
Look, I just wanted to come by
and apologize for last night.

841
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,967
I mean I don't know
if that was...

842
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,645
No, you don't have to apologize.

843
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,121
I had a great time.
It was really fun.

844
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,205
Oh, cool. And I brought a little gift
for Mrs. McGowan.

845
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,322
- Oh, you did?
- Yeah.

846
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,925
What a nice boy.

847
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,651
Yeah, well, I figured it'd give me
a good excuse to come by,

848
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,687
see you again today.

849
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,411
Right, oh...
I'll be sure she gets this.

850
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,201
So, um, what do you got
doing for Christmas?

851
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,723
Well, I volunteered
to stay with Nancy through New Year's

852
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,888
so that the other nurse
could go be with her family, so...

853
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,565
Well, what about your family,
though?

854
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,210
You're not going up to Boston or...

855
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,169
I don't really have anybody left.

856
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,530
Um, yeah, after my dad,
it's kinda just me. So...

857
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,610
Well, in that case why don't you
and Mrs. McGowan

858
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,524
come over
to my mom's house tonight?

859
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,920
It's just gonna be a little dinner.

860
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,923
But at least you're not going
to be sitting here alone.

861
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,048
That would be great.
But she can't leave the house.

862
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,124
The doctor just wants her
to kinda stay put. So...

863
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,527
But we're great.
We're gonna order in pizza,

864
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,889
eat our faces off
till she falls asleep at 8:30.

865
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,929
Then I'm gonna have
a glass of wine, maybe two.

866
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,043
I gotta tell you
that just sounds, uh,

867
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,281
a little bit depressing.

868
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,522
- I mean, for Christmas Eve.
- It's not depressing.

869
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,364
If you think it's so depressing,
why don't you come over?

870
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,965
Come over for the wine part.

871
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,604
You know what,
I would love to.

872
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,087
But I actually...
It's Christmas Eve.

873
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,924
And we've got
this thing going on

874
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,607
with my father
and my whole family that...

875
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,603
that's gonna need
to be addressed tonight.

876
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,842
Yeah. So you're gonna
need a drink.

877
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,480
Yes. I probably will.

878
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,642
So, you know what,
maybe when I'm done with them,

879
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,610
- I could come by here.
- Yeah. Okay.

880
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,328
All right. I'll, uh...
I'll throw a pebble at your window

881
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,322
if you're still up.

882
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,801
All right.
Just don't wake up Nancy, please.

883
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,201
What do you say, Dad?

884
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,840
Hey. I was hoping to get
a decent burger.

885
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,081
But no such luck.

886
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,368
Yeah. Well, that didn't stop you
from eating it.

887
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,931
That's probably
why this place is empty.

888
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,890
You know my dad would be heartbroken,
he saw the place like this.

889
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,087
Yeah, well, look,
you're more than welcome

890
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,368
to jump behind the grill
any time you want.

891
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,923
Why don't you get some young people
in here, you know?

892
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,491
Bring the kids in.

893
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,768
Hey, maybe your brother, Cyril...

894
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,925
Good idea. Dad,
Cyril just got out of rehab today.

895
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,401
All right? The last thing he needs
in his life is this bar.

896
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,887
Yeah.

897
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,440
That's another regret in my life.

898
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,806
- I don't even know that kid.
- Yeah.

899
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,445
Try picking up the phone.

900
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,086
He won't talk to me.

901
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,446
You know what he told me?

902
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,360
That I'm dead in his life.

903
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,601
Can you blame him?

904
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,723
You were a lousy father.

905
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,121
Exaggerated.

906
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,090
I slapped the kids around
a little bit. But...

907
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,969
that's the way it went
in those days.

908
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,326
I'm not talking about that.

909
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,209
You walked out on us.

910
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,766
- I got back when I could.
- Yeah. Which was never.

911
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,649
Look, I don't even
wanna have this conversation.

912
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,961
So, what else you got, Dad?

913
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,487
Ah, I went to see Father Mike.

914
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,210
I had a confession.

915
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,124
You must have been in there
a while.

916
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,926
Hmm.

917
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,044
We had a good talk.

918
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,089
Well, I didn't with Mom.

919
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,687
I spoke to her and she does not
want this to happen at all.

920
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,482
I don't understand that woman.

921
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,962
All I wanna be is with my family
at Christmas.

922
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,281
Is that so unreasonable?

923
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,807
You're just lonely.

924
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,928
All right? This is your first
Christmas on your own.

925
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,050
After the holidays pass,
I'm sure you will be fine.

926
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,085
No, Gerald.

927
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,480
It's, uh...

928
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,088
It's gonna be my last Christmas.

929
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,925
Your last Christmas?

930
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,970
What are you gonna do?
Kill yourself because of the money?

931
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,327
Because of Carol.
I mean, come on, Dad.

932
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,811
Oh, it's not that.

933
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,330
Well, then what--what is it?

934
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,005
I'm dyin'.

935
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,769
Pancreatic cancer.

936
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,970
Very advanced.

937
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,008
I got four or five months, tops.

938
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,647
What?

939
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,007
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

940
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,765
What are the doctors saying?

941
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,650
That I'm dying.

942
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,564
Oh, Jesus Christ.

943
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,482
Who else knows?

944
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,331
Just Erin.

945
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,169
Driving over to see Dorothy,
tell her, then...

946
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,369
I thought it would be better
to tell each of you face to face.

947
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,723
So... I need your help.

948
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,570
Can you talk to your mother?

949
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,841
Tell her this is
so important to me.

950
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,640
Okay. Yeah.

951
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,006
- I will.
- Okay?

952
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,128
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Gerry.

953
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,244
We got a good family.

954
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,248
The best.

955
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,766
The best.

956
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,610
- Let me get you a drink.
- Yeah.

957
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,090
Skippy, it's...

958
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,241
What are you doing here?

959
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,686
It's Christmas Eve.

960
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,804
I've got some gifts for the boys.

961
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,126
I was hoping
that maybe we could talk.

962
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,964
No. I don't want to talk.

963
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,929
I told you if you wanna talk,
call my cell.

964
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,206
Is he here?

965
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,846
- There's nobody here.
- There's nobody here.

966
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,126
Is he in my fucking bed?

967
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,847
Because I'd like to have
a little chat with him,

968
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,922
- rip his fucking head off.
- Calm down.

969
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,048
There's nobody here. All right?

970
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,049
What is going on?

971
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,971
I can't do this anymore, okay?

972
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,004
Our life wasn't bad,
but I know that there's more out there.

973
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,525
- And I just can't do it.
- What is that?

974
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,762
What's... What's...
What's better?

975
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,882
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

976
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,326
I don't know, but when I find it
I'll let you know.

977
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,050
Oh, thank you.
That's very kind of you.

978
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,361
That's extremely generous.

979
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,807
Please, please,
let me know when you find it.

980
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,367
Skippy.

981
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,329
Merry fucking Christmas, Dot.

982
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,329
Hey. Hey.
Where are you going?

983
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,527
- Hey.
- Come on.

984
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,842
Yeah. You know
with Mr. Ryan comin'...

985
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,967
And I gotta go help my mother
for dinner tonight.

986
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,522
No, no, no, no. Come on.
I want some more action.

987
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,721
I would. I would.

988
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,201
But I gotta go pick up
a bunch of fish for my mom

989
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,011
and help her with the tree
and with the lights.

990
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,924
You know, I'm looking forward
to meeting your mom tonight.

991
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,844
Yeah, Dottie, about that...

992
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,480
Um, you know, it's just gonna be

993
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,610
sort of like a little get-together
with family.

994
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,730
I'll bring a few decent bottles
of wine, okay?

995
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,248
'Cause it's terrible to eat a nice dinner
with cheap-ass wine.

996
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,402
- All right?
- Okay.

997
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,005
- All right. Bye.
- Ciao,<i>mammone.</i>

998
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,241
<i>Ciao.</i>

999
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,480
Good morning.

1000
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,966
- Hey.
- How are you?

1001
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,406
Good.

1002
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,006
- Oh, hi, babe.
- Hi.

1003
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,243
It's 1 P.M.,
so that's actually afternoon.

1004
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,402
Oh, good afternoon.

1005
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,284
All right. What's the plan?
What are we doing?

1006
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,087
Hey.
Just doing a crossword.

1007
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,446
What do you need,
a four-letter word

1008
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,762
for sitting around on your ass
on a beautiful day?

1009
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,925
Just relax, okay.
Have a little breakfast.

1010
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,287
Relax? No, come on.
I wanna go down to the beach.

1011
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,681
Mm-mm. It's way too cold
to go to the beach today.

1012
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,842
I got some herb
if anybody wants some.

1013
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,041
- Really, you got weed?
- Yeah.

1014
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,601
Wait. Seriously, we're not going
to the beach at all while we're here?

1015
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,205
- No. We are going to the beach.
- Just relax.

1016
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,169
You and I,
we're going to the beach.

1017
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,721
Enjoy the herb.

1018
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,167
I will.

1019
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,601
Come on, last chance.

1020
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,121
Have a good time.
I'll see you when you get back.

1021
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,406
Okay.

1022
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,281
Hi.

1023
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,248
Hey.

1024
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,049
- Where you been?
- I was down at the pub.

1025
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,922
That was fun last night.

1026
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,969
Yeah. I guess.

1027
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,321
Been a while.

1028
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,970
Yeah.

1029
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,447
Actually, it's been
about three months.

1030
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,807
Yeah. Well,
I've got things on my mind.

1031
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,365
You know howl remembered?

1032
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,601
'Cause it was so special?

1033
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,001
Yeah, it was.

1034
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,044
You're not gonna believe it.

1035
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,487
And I didn't want to tell you
'cause I know you're scared,

1036
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,886
but it's gonna be okay.

1037
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,963
No. What are you talking about?

1038
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,366
I missed a couple of periods.

1039
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,005
- You what?
- And I took a pregnancy test.

1040
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,606
- And guess what?
- No, no, no, no, Connie, do not say that.

1041
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,171
- Oh, JJ, it's a good thing.
- Do not say this.

1042
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,362
- It's a good thing.
- No, no, no. This is not a good thing.

1043
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,284
This is a goddamn disaster.

1044
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,090
How could you let this happen?

1045
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,805
How the hell could you
let this happen?

1046
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:54,882
We can't afford this.

1047
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,530
It's gonna be fine because you're
gonna find something soon.

1048
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,806
And we can ask
my brothers for help.

1049
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,486
No, no, no, no. I don't want
any favors from your brothers.

1050
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,369
- Shit. This is a nightmare.
- Oh, JJ. JJ.

1051
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,442
Once it settles in,
you're gonna see it.

1052
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,682
- Why didn't you take the pill like I asked you to?
- This is a blessing.

1053
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,446
- JJ, we're gonna have a family.
- A blessing?

1054
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,806
Yeah. Oh, come on.

1055
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,450
Just get out of my way.

1056
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,521
Hey.

1057
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,365
You better get your ass
out of here right now

1058
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,124
- before I kick your...
- Piss off, Richie.

1059
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,044
Get your ass out of here.

1060
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,801
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1061
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,200
Yeah, I'm okay.

1062
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,210
What are you doing with this guy?
He's a total scumbag.

1063
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,767
No, no. It's not like that.
He's just having a hard time.

1064
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,410
He's out of work and...

1065
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,245
Bullshit. I've heard
what goes on over here.

1066
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,731
Look. I'll call Gerry, okay?

1067
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,450
He'll know what to do.
Please, just... It's fine.

1068
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,726
It's fine.

1069
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,846
Thank you.

1070
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,242
Father, not a word of this
to anyone.

1071
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,761
Agreed. Confidential.

1072
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,730
And now, I want to ask
something of you.

1073
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,530
Anything you want, Father.

1074
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,161
James was in to see me
this afternoon.

1075
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,766
Was he, really?

1076
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,441
I am forbidden to break
the seal of confession

1077
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,321
but I want you to know
that he is deeply sorry

1078
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,209
for the wrongs he committed
in the past,

1079
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,250
particularly to you
and the children.

1080
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,609
I'm glad he's made
his peace with you.

1081
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,121
But I am not having him
over tomorrow.

1082
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,363
Rosie, he only has
a few months left.

1083
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,005
A few months?

1084
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,400
Where's he going?

1085
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,286
He's dying.

1086
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,646
Is that what he told you?

1087
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,121
People don't lie about dying.

1088
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,164
Then you don't know
the same James that I know.

1089
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,681
Rosie, this is it.

1090
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,604
Now, he's going to be dead soon

1091
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,684
and I suggest,
in your own best interest,

1092
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,285
that you forgive him

1093
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,967
and invite him back into the arms
of his own family.

1094
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,645
Family?

1095
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,643
Is that what he calls us now?

1096
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,407
You insisted on having
this child baptized.

1097
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:21,009
Yet you yourself will not follow
Christ's teaching on forgiveness?

1098
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,731
Because he's got his whole life
ahead of him.

1099
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,847
Me?

1100
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,571
I figure I'm already a lost cause.

1101
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,451
This is not the season
for your jokes

1102
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,125
or for hardness of heart.

1103
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,931
You say that as if I have
a choice in the matter.

1104
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,924
Thanks again, Father.

1105
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,802
<i>Hi, this is Rosie.
Leave it at the beep.</i>

1106
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,361
Yeah. Hey, Mom, it's me.

1107
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,682
Look, the whole idea
of having a cell phone

1108
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:51,003
is that periodically
you pick the thing up.

1109
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,481
All right, look. I just saw Dad.
He came by the restaurant.

1110
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,971
And we need to talk. Okay?

1111
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,361
So, give me a call
when you get this.

1112
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,411
Thank you very much.

1113
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,123
Hey, Nora, it's, uh,
it's Gerry.

1114
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,005
Look, uh...

1115
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,963
I kinda need
to talk to someone

1116
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,090
who isn't completely
out of their fucking minds.

1117
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,001
And that kinda disqualifies
my entire family. So...

1118
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,521
ls there any way
I could maybe swing by,

1119
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,569
pick your brain for a little bit?

1120
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,970
All right. Great. I'll see you,
15, 20 minutes or so?

1121
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,322
All right. Perfect.
I'll just pull up outside.

1122
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,690
Cool. Thank you.

1123
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,526
You know he married the shiksa.

1124
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,122
And he's celebrating his first
Christmas with her and her kids.

1125
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,205
Back up. Your father
is celebrating Christmas?

1126
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,964
He's making an effort.

1127
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,087
You see.

1128
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,083
These old geezers hook up
with a younger girl,

1129
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,651
they think they're getting
a free ride.

1130
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,961
But there is no such thing.

1131
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,929
I know.
I know, it's pathetic.

1132
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,321
- But that's not the point.
- No, it's hysterical.

1133
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,721
I would love to see the look
on your father's face

1134
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,769
as he has to pretend
to enjoy Christmas.

1135
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,127
Oh, she should make him
dress up as Santa.

1136
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,123
Well, I can grant you that wish

1137
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,964
since he wants us to be there.

1138
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,965
Absolutely not.

1139
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,123
I'm his only kid.

1140
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,281
This is his first Christmas.

1141
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,363
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

1142
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,284
I'm serious. He wants us...
Thank you.

1143
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,522
He wants us to drive up
to Connecticut and help him do this.

1144
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,085
No shot.

1145
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,804
We've always done every Christmas
with your family.

1146
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,882
I mean...

1147
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,961
Last year.

1148
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,009
Erin, that was awful.
I mean...

1149
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:44,882
Well, he was drunk and he apologized
and he's sober now.

1150
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,485
Okay.

1151
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,721
Listen, I don't ask for much.

1152
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,166
All I'm asking for
is this one Christmas.

1153
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,085
Well, it would kill my mother especially
since we just blew off her birthday.

1154
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,447
You don't even like
your brothers and sisters.

1155
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,522
Well, why not
blow them off this year?

1156
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,002
'Cause this year's different.
I'm sorry. End of discussion.

1157
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,005
End of discussion?

1158
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,131
What--What's so different
about this year?

1159
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,520
Just different.

1160
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,322
Why won't you talk to me?

1161
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,170
Can we please just shop?

1162
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,164
- Let's shop.
- Okay.

1163
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,362
See? Isn't this great?

1164
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,761
Yeah, it's great.
Freezing my balls off.

1165
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,323
So, hey, you're really
gonna propose to this girl?

1166
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,448
Yeah. It's time.

1167
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,601
Why? Why is it time?

1168
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,810
Why can't you give it a year,
or like, at least another month.

1169
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,327
Because I'm not getting
any younger, Sharon.

1170
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,051
And I want to have kids
before I'm an old man.

1171
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,531
Well, do you love her?

1172
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,568
I like her...a great deal.

1173
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,529
She has her faults, but...

1174
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,684
she's a good kid.
She's smart, she's funny.

1175
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,490
But you don't love her.

1176
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,722
She comes from
a very good family.

1177
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,769
It's a shame she can't say
the same thing about you.

1178
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,002
That's another reason
I gotta lock this girl down.

1179
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,441
But you can't tell me
that you love her.

1180
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:17,040
You know, at my age,
love is not the first priority.

1181
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,402
I'm done looking around.
This is it.

1182
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,891
Oh.

1183
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,965
Richie T?

1184
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,486
Hey. Rich, what's up?

1185
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:36,847
What?

1186
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,011
Whoa! Whoa! Slow down.

1187
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,331
Which sister?

1188
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,365
Is he still there?

1189
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,241
Okay. I'm on my way.

1190
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,561
What is it?
What happened?

1191
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,245
JJ fucking hit Connie.

1192
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,524
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not kidding you.

1193
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,682
I gotta go deal with this.
I'll drop you off at the house.

1194
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,968
No freaking way.
I'm coming with you.

1195
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,966
Hi, honey.

1196
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,488
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

1197
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,722
Listen, this is
fucking horrible, okay?

1198
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,450
- No, no, no.
- No, it's terrible.

1199
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,284
Listen, you're not
going back to your house.

1200
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,766
- You can stay with me--
- No, you don't know the whole story--

1201
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,160
No, listen. You can stay with Mom
or you can stay with me,

1202
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,486
but you're never going
back to that house.

1203
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,880
No, it's my house.

1204
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,122
Yeah. But you've got to do
this now, honey.

1205
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,721
- You know, he had a hard year.
- Oh, fuck that.

1206
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,121
Fuck that. I'm sorry.
That's what you said the last time

1207
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,281
and the time before

1208
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,283
and you keep giving him
another chance,

1209
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,487
- and look what happens.
- Oh, I know.

1210
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,607
You've gotta do this.
I mean,

1211
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,761
you've got to tell him
that you're leaving him.

1212
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,041
You're gonna file for divorce
and that's it.

1213
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,361
I'm pregnant.

1214
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:51,409
Oh, my God.
Oh, Connie.

1215
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,328
- Why?
- I don't know why.

1216
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,209
It just happened.

1217
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,771
And he knows this?

1218
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,570
And he still pushed you?

1219
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,051
I'm sorry,
for the sake of this kid

1220
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,725
you've got to get him
the hell out of your life.

1221
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,450
He's an asshole.

1222
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,602
- You have to, honey.
- I know.

1223
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,364
Okay.

1224
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,486
- You think it's him?
- I don't know.

1225
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,449
Here.
Go hide in the TV room.

1226
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:16,966
Oh, my God, it's Dad.

1227
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,605
- Dad?
- Yeah.

1228
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,969
- Daddy?
- Hey, it's Christmas Eve.

1229
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,201
- What are you doing?
- I got presents.

1230
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,521
I sot gifts.

1231
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,045
- Good to see you.
- Come in. Oh, my God.

1232
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,441
- Yeah.
- What are you doing here?

1233
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,001
Oh, it's Christmas Eve.
Come on.

1234
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,889
It's the best.

1235
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,963
- Baby, Connie, how are you?
- Hi, Daddy.

1236
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,043
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, sweetie.

1237
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,440
- All right.
- This is great.

1238
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,562
The house looks fabulous.

1239
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,721
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1240
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,805
Is it too early for wine?
Because, you know, I could use a glass.

1241
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,522
This is ridiculous.
I mean...

1242
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,091
I'm just give 'em a quick call.

1243
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,122
Hmm.

1244
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,926
See what's going on.

1245
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,686
Oh, shit.

1246
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,206
- Hey.
- Hey.

1247
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,283
What's going on?
It's like, almost two hours.

1248
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,727
Yeah, yeah. I know.
I should have called earlier. I'm sorry.

1249
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,321
But we had an emergency
and so we had to go.

1250
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,845
You had to go?
What are you talking about?

1251
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,240
What kind of emergency?

1252
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,926
We had a family emergency,
but we're taking care of it.

1253
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,161
Well, when are you
coming back here?

1254
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,368
And what are you talking about?
When are you coming back here?

1255
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,602
I don't know.
We have to go by one of my sister's.

1256
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:21,886
We don't have
a fucking car here.

1257
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,246
You're leaving me stranded
here without a car?

1258
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,925
What are you talking about?

1259
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,889
I don't understand.
Are you kidding me with this?

1260
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,042
I'm telling you that we have
a family emergency

1261
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,725
and this is how you react to that?

1262
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,167
Look, I can't even talk to you right now.

1263
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:36,284
- God, what a jerk.
- What, they pissed at us?

1264
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,771
I don't really give a crap.

1265
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,565
Ohh.

1266
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,440
What's up?
ls everything okay?

1267
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,686
I don't even know why I called,
quite honestly,

1268
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,161
dragging you into my mess.

1269
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,606
Don't worry about it.

1270
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,201
What's going on?

1271
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,324
All right. Well, it's...

1272
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,806
It's my dad.

1273
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,971
He just told me he's got

1274
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,249
a few months to live and...

1275
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,881
I don't know,
I'm just kind of numb,

1276
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,162
I didn't know who else to call.

1277
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,851
You're probably sitting here
looking at me like,

1278
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,804
"Who the fuck is this guy?
I just met you yesterday

1279
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,161
"and you're dropping
this shit on me?"

1280
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,606
No. I'm not.

1281
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,969
- I'm not. I'm not at all. Yeah.
- You sure?

1282
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,485
Don't apologize.

1283
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,288
Oh, you know,
I mean, he's dying, right?

1284
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:48,206
So, obviously I'm upset, but...

1285
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,762
I'm also fucking furious with him

1286
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,163
because it's the kind of bullshit
he's always pulled.

1287
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,806
You know, he only calls
when he wants something from me,

1288
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,610
like everybody else
in my family.

1289
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,969
You know, they're all consumed
with their own shit.

1290
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,527
I mean, yesterday,
it's my mother's birthday, and...

1291
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,081
not one of them can find time
in their busy fucking schedules

1292
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,049
to come out and celebrate
her day with her?

1293
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,168
And they get that from him
because...

1294
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:16,331
you know, he's the most selfish
son of a bitch alive.

1295
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,324
And, you know, now,
now he wants my help because...

1296
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,801
he wants to come home
for Christmas.

1297
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,410
And I'm like, "You know what,
I've been helping you

1298
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,080
since you walked out on us
20 years ago."

1299
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,891
I mean,
I raised half of his kids.

1300
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,883
I took care of my mother
when she was losing her mind

1301
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,041
those first couple of years,

1302
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,168
and he's off in Manhattan
having a great time.

1303
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,364
I even took over his father's business
when his old man died.

1304
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,405
And I didn't wanna do
any of this shit.

1305
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,881
I didn't ask for it, but I didn't have
a fucking choice, you know.

1306
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,644
And it's like...
Do you think he ever said thank you?

1307
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,690
Do you think any of them ever say
thank you for anything? No.

1308
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,400
I'm just...

1309
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,726
I just... I'm kinda...

1310
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,843
I just wish I could be
fucking done with them.

1311
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,240
The whole...

1312
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,922
I don't know. I don't know.
I'm sorry. I'm just...

1313
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,923
No, no, no, no. That's okay.

1314
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,404
Is there a question in there
anywhere

1315
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,965
OI' are we...

1316
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,487
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

1317
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:18,564
- You know?
- What do you wanna do?

1318
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,291
I wanna wash my hands
of the whole lot of them.

1319
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,522
Just like, "You know what,
why don't you guys just figure it out

1320
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,091
on your own for once?"

1321
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,726
So do that.

1322
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,604
You know,
have your dad figure it out,

1323
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,286
have your brothers and sisters
figure it out for themselves.

1324
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,363
Let them
do it for themselves.

1325
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,441
It might surprise you.

1326
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,608
I seriously doubt it. But...

1327
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:45,124
I definitely like the idea
of letting them try, you know.

1328
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,282
I think that's the hardest thing
in the world, you know,

1329
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,965
for people like us.

1330
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,444
But it sounds like it's time.

1331
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,807
Connie went over to Dot's.

1332
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,122
Hopefully this guy's
still fucking here.

1333
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:07,604
- Stay here.
- You kidding?

1334
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,089
Hey, jerk-off, what is your problem?

1335
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,924
- Hey, douchebag!
- You can't keep your hands to yourself?

1336
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,724
Seriously,
what is your problem?

1337
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,486
Do me a favor
and listen real close.

1338
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,927
You're gonna go inside,
you're gonna pack up,

1339
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,162
and you're gonna
get the fuck out of this house.

1340
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,322
- That's right.
- And out of Queens.

1341
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,563
I see you here past tonight,

1342
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,444
you're not going to the hospital,

1343
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,244
you're going to the fucking morgue.

1344
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,687
And he means it.
Don't you think he doesn't.

1345
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,804
You understand me?

1346
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,041
Answer me!

1347
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,690
I understand.

1348
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,848
Now get the fuck out of here.

1349
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,128
Get the fuck out of here!

1350
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,004
Pack your shit and go.

1351
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,971
We'll wait till he leaves.

1352
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,285
Hey, Rosie, we're home.

1353
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,727
Oh, um, I'm in the TV room.

1354
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,251
Where's Aaron?

1355
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,851
He's still napping.

1356
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,729
Oh, Mom,
you can't let him sleep all day.

1357
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,644
I'll never get him to bed tonight.

1358
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,928
It's all right. I got him.
How was he?

1359
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,241
He was great.

1360
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:19,847
Erin.

1361
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,368
Could you come in here?
I-I've got something I wanna tell you.

1362
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,641
I talked to Gerry.

1363
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:30,408
And I'm assuming that you want me
to have your father over tomorrow, too.

1364
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,525
Yeah. Of course I do.

1365
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:38,649
And you really believe this bullshit
that he's dying?

1366
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,442
No, Mom, it's for real.
He's been sick for a while.

1367
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,126
It wouldn't be the first time
he told an elaborate lie

1368
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,281
to get what he wants.

1369
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,488
Mom, I've been with him
to the hospital

1370
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,688
and I've gone with him
to see the specialist.

1371
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,764
The why wouldn't he
tell anyone before this?

1372
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,606
And on my birthday, too.
That's a great present.

1373
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,764
He didn't want anyone to know.
I haven't even told Corey yet.

1374
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,925
Why would the stubborn jackass wait
and keep it a secret?

1375
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,411
Mom, you know Dad.

1376
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,686
He thought he'd beat it.

1377
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,650
Oh, he's been
such a stubborn old fool.

1378
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,087
- Mom!
- Well, I don't know what to say.

1379
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,322
If anyone deserved it,
it would be him.

1380
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,604
But there will be no tears
shed for him from me.

1381
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,971
How can you say such a thing?

1382
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,885
I know he hurt you
but he's still our father.

1383
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:31,010
The pain he's dealing with now

1384
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:35,210
is insignificant
to the pain he's caused us.

1385
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,169
What about me?

1386
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,210
What about you, your childhood,
those little ones?

1387
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,125
Never having a father
in the house.

1388
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,601
That is real pain.

1389
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,888
Pain you carry with you
for a lifetime.

1390
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,691
So you're gonna cause
more pain for all of us

1391
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,683
and not let him come over.

1392
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,846
When he walked out on this family
20 years ago,

1393
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,642
I told him he would never set foot
in my house again,

1394
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,167
and I am sticking to it.

1395
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,164
You son of a bitch.

1396
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,569
You're not gonna make me cry.

1397
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,122
Son of a bitch!

1398
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,441
Oh.

1399
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,449
- Hey, Dottie, we're here.
- Oh, hey.

1400
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,931
We're in the kitchen.

1401
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,807
Whoa!
Dad, what are you doing here?

1402
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,288
And a very merry to you too.

1403
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,046
I'm sorry. I'm just surprised.
How you doing?

1404
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,123
Give me a hug.
There you go.

1405
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,807
- Sharon.
- No. I'm good. Thanks.

1406
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,889
Why didn't you tell us
Dad's here?

1407
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,168
Uh... He just showed up.

1408
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,682
All right.
Well, despite this pleasant surprise,

1409
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:08,887
we came to see Connie.

1410
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:12,408
Now, before I get to the part
about how you're an idiot,

1411
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,324
- are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1412
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:15,720
Okay, good, because you're
a fucking idiot.

1413
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,041
- Thanks.
- What are you doing with this guy?

1414
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,241
- Sharon?
- Are you kidding me?

1415
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,970
Sharon, Sharon, please.

1416
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,606
Listen, she's just upset
and frankly, so am I.

1417
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,889
I gotta find out from Richie T
what's going on in your marriage?

1418
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,085
We just came from a little visit
with your soon-to-be ex-husband.

1419
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,401
- What did you do?
- Quinn.

1420
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,846
Quinn, what did you do?

1421
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,001
I just talked to the guy.

1422
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,645
But believe me,
he got the message.

1423
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,046
- What's this you're talking about?
- Nothing.

1424
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,247
It's none of your business.
Just butt out.

1425
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,890
- Can I talk to you privately?
- Sure.

1426
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,366
us...

1427
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,967
- What did you do to him?
- I did not hurt him.

1428
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,451
Not that he didn't deserve it.

1429
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,090
But you know what?
I got a question for you.

1430
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,805
This is going on,
you don't tell me about it?

1431
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,247
- What's that about?
- Well, it's not like we talk a lot, Quinn.

1432
01:06:58,800 --> 01:06:59,926
I'm still your brother.

1433
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,925
And if anybody hurts you ever,
I wanna know about it.

1434
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,611
And just so you know,
what I did tell this prick,

1435
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,967
is he is never
to go near you again,

1436
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:12,846
which also means,

1437
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,207
you are never going near him
again either.

1438
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,202
You're finished with this guy.

1439
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,442
- I know, I know, I know.
- Do you?

1440
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,211
Because if this happens again,

1441
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,169
I will fucking kill this guy.

1442
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:28,124
And doing 25 to life,
for homicide,

1443
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,884
is really gonna screw up my plans
for the future.

1444
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,644
So...

1445
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,643
Please don't put me
in that position.

1446
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,440
Connie,

1447
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,246
I love you.

1448
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,723
So, Sharon, uh...

1449
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,167
Dad stopped by because he has
some big announcement

1450
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,731
he wants to share with all of us.

1451
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,160
Isn't that right, Daddy?

1452
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:58,211
Well, it's nothing
to celebrate, really,

1453
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:02,050
although some of you might.

1454
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:06,325
I...
It's just something I...

1455
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,170
I need to discuss with you.

1456
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,484
Can't wait. I gotta go outside
and make a phone call.

1457
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:14,641
Sharon...

1458
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:23,091
Don't mind her, Daddy.
She's just a spoiled brat.

1459
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,123
Yeah, can't blame her though.

1460
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,691
Can't blame her.

1461
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,122
What are you talking about,
you're not coming back tonight?

1462
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,567
Look, we just figured,
since we're already out here

1463
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:37,486
and you seem to be dealing with
some kind of important emergency

1464
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,085
that we thought we'd
just hang out a little bit.

1465
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,924
What is this "we"?

1466
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,281
Me and Abbie.

1467
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:44,930
Yeah, yeah, I know who.

1468
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,730
Sharon, I don't know what
you want me to say, okay?

1469
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,008
You and your brother seemed
to think it was fine to take off

1470
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,446
and abandon us
without saying anything.

1471
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,325
I don't know what the fuck you thought
was gonna happen.

1472
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,285
Okay, I told you we had
a family emergency.

1473
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:57,720
Right, I don't know what you
want me to say, Sharon.

1474
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:01,680
Okay? We're hanging out,
and we're kinda having a good time.

1475
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,524
You're "kinda having a good time"?

1476
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,651
You know my brother is planning on
proposing to her tonight!

1477
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,245
You have to get her back here.

1478
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,528
You know, he may wanna
check his voice-mail on that one,

1479
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,524
because she's pretty pissed off
that he left without saying anything.

1480
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,330
Let her know.

1481
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,164
And you know what, Sharon?

1482
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,243
Seeing as you think this relationship
has no future,

1483
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,925
I was kinda thinking
this might be a good time

1484
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,411
for us to call it quits anyhow.

1485
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,166
Oh, my God.

1486
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,607
You know what?
You are a creepy old freak

1487
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,285
and the two of you
deserve each other.

1488
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,090
Yeah, whatever.

1489
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:34,685
- Nice.
- Done.

1490
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,283
I had no idea
what to get you,

1491
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,124
so you're probably
gonna hate it.

1492
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:55,044
Got Ma something nice, though.

1493
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,440
That's good.

1494
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,530
Hey.

1495
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,842
You know you're gonna
get through this, right?

1496
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,206
You think so?

1497
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:04,961
Absolutely fucking certain of it.

1498
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,121
Gerry,

1499
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,521
I don't know
what the hell to do now.

1500
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,963
Look, you don't need to worry
about that right now, all right?

1501
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:16,169
After the New Year,
we'll get you hooked up with a job,

1502
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:17,970
or maybe, I don't know,
you go back to school, maybe both.

1503
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,121
Go back to school?

1504
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,248
I'm not going back
to fucking school.

1505
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:24,726
What the fuck job
am I gonna get?

1506
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,644
I will find you something, all right?

1507
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:27,722
You're home now.

1508
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,166
You're with your family.

1509
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,321
All right? That's what we do.

1510
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,720
We take care of one another.

1511
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,285
Shit, man, I'm sorry.

1512
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,329
Speaking of family...

1513
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,005
Yo, Fitzy, what you got?

1514
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,481
Hey, Gerry, it's Quinn.

1515
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,290
What are you doing right now?

1516
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,408
No, I'm just actually
sitting here with Cyril.

1517
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:52,770
- We're having a little talk.
- Dad's here. He just told us.

1518
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,167
Can you fucking believe
he's dying?

1519
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,685
Anyway,
you gotta get over here.

1520
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,842
We need to talk about Christmas.

1521
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,241
All right, yeah.
Yeah, we'll be right over.

1522
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:08,410
You think you're ready
to see the old man?

1523
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,484
No.

1524
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:12,687
No!

1525
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,002
So what's with her nibs?

1526
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,446
How does she know my Gerry?

1527
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,728
Oh, they met here, yesterday.

1528
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:26,129
She asked about him,
so I sent her up to the bar to meet him.

1529
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,688
But don't you think
she's a little old for him?

1530
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,411
No, I don't think so.
I think they'd make a cute couple.

1531
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,005
Well, what's her story?

1532
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,242
No, rea--
Why isn't she married?

1533
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,606
At her age.

1534
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,286
I'm not as nosy as you.
I didn't ask her.

1535
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,289
She seems like a nice girl.

1536
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,005
I thought I'd do them each a favor.

1537
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:47,766
Yeah, but there must be a story.
There's always a story.

1538
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,890
What do you want?
Do you want him to die a bachelor?

1539
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,601
No kids, having a Christmas
like the one that I'm gonna have tomorrow

1540
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:55,647
with no one by my side?

1541
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,245
Look, you do not have to be alone.

1542
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,890
I want you to come over
to my house.

1543
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,730
I don't want to go to your house.

1544
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,770
There's gonna be more drama there
than my poor heart can take.

1545
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,888
So what am I gonna do about James?

1546
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,527
I can't have that man in my house.

1547
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,450
I gotta tell you something.

1548
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,763
My Thomas,
that son of a bitch,

1549
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:24,003
as much as I hated him
with a passion,

1550
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:27,164
there's not a day that goes by

1551
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,806
that I don't wish that he were here.

1552
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,007
You don't mean that.

1553
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,406
I do. I do mean it.

1554
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:33,925
And you know what I would do?

1555
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,082
I would tie him up in that chair

1556
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,288
and I would pistol-whip him
until he screamed

1557
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,568
for all the trouble
that he caused me.

1558
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,287
You know.

1559
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,442
You know.

1560
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,166
But seriously,

1561
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,964
if Deirdre were still here,

1562
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,009
and she wanted me
to forgive him,

1563
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,731
she wanted me to spend
Christmas with him...

1564
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,611
how could I say no?

1565
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:09,323
Well, if I do forgive him,

1566
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,729
I might have to borrow your pistol.

1567
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,771
I mean it.

1568
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,004
- Hey! Look who's back.
- Cyril!

1569
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,969
- Hey!
- Hi!

1570
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,523
Oh.
Missed you.

1571
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,005
Come here.

1572
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,849
I'm really proud of you.

1573
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,400
How's it going, Son?

1574
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,525
Better than you, I hear.

1575
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,205
Yeah, you look good.

1576
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,169
Welcome back.

1577
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,845
Oh, shit. Is this...

1578
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:48,887
...allowed?

1579
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,565
Are we okay to drink
in front of you?

1580
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,927
You never gave a shit
about my feelings before. Okay?

1581
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,161
Don't start now.

1582
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,567
Makin' it easy.
That's a change.

1583
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,370
Merry Christmas to you, too.

1584
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:01,330
All right, so we're all here.
Let's talk about tomorrow.

1585
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:04,245
No, no, no, no.
Not till Erin gets here.

1586
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,402
And why...
Why do I always forget her?

1587
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,642
Because she's a stuck-up
pain in the ass.

1588
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,847
You know,
she's really not stuck-up.

1589
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,126
She just thinks
she's better than you.

1590
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,169
Yeah, well,
she's not the only one.

1591
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,084
Where... Where are these
comments coming from?

1592
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:16,685
I think you know where
these comments are coming from.

1593
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:17,841
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1594
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,161
Yeah, we talked about this.

1595
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,651
Let's cut all the bullshit.

1596
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,043
Erin's been through this
every step of the way with me.

1597
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:26,009
She brought me
to the best doctors.

1598
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:29,729
She's been at my bedside
all through this ordeal.

1599
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,562
So I don't want anybody
bad-mouthing her.

1600
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,802
We can still bad-mouth you,
though, right?

1601
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,843
Do what you must.

1602
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,520
You know, Daddy,
you should've told us about this.

1603
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:44,806
We... We could've helped you.

1604
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,081
That's not entirely true.

1605
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:47,651
Yeah, I gotta agree with him on that.

1606
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,564
- Can't you guys just be nice?
- Who said anything about...

1607
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:50,801
Yeah, you wanna chill
with the comments?

1608
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,570
It's Christmas. Be jolly and merry
and all that other shit.

1609
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,768
No, no, no, no.
They're entitled. But...

1610
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:57,571
Hey, Gerry, why don't you call and see
if there's any word from Erin.

1611
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,041
I called her on the way over.

1612
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,531
She should be here any minute.

1613
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,640
An angel just got their wings.

1614
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,529
None for you, though, Pops.

1615
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,361
I'll get the door.

1616
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:09,727
God!

1617
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,405
- What the fuck's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you, Cyril?

1618
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,928
- It was just a joke.
- Oh, it's a joke.

1619
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:17,447
Pancreatic cancer victim,
Christmas, it's a joke?

1620
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,204
Shut up.
Just lay off him, all right?

1621
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,327
- Lay off?
- Yes!

1622
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,447
- You lay off!
- Give him a fucking break!

1623
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,011
Shh! Our father is dying!

1624
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,769
Oh, Daddy.

1625
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,160
Nancy?

1626
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:37,606
You asleep?

1627
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:42,444
Mmm. I'm fine.

1628
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,444
I'm gonna go now, sweetie.

1629
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,648
Oh... Okay.

1630
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,450
- Have a good Christmas.
- Okay.

1631
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:02,890
She's falling asleep.

1632
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,646
Yeah, well, it's about that time.

1633
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,246
I understand
you...you met my boy.

1634
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,811
I did. I did.

1635
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,365
He's very nice.

1636
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,124
I don't need you to tell me that.

1637
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,721
Okay.

1638
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,170
What's your name?

1639
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,687
My name? Nora.

1640
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,410
What's your last name?

1641
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:25,965
Daugherty.

1642
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,645
How do you spell that?

1643
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,246
If you're wondering
if I'm Irish, I'm not.

1644
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,164
Then what is it? Scottish?

1645
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,402
Grandparents were English.

1646
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,564
Merry Christmas.

1647
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,642
Merry Christmas.

1648
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,483
So, what are we supposed to do
if Mom does not agree

1649
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,244
to have Dad over for Christmas?

1650
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,051
It seems clear she already said
she wasn't gonna have him over.

1651
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,528
Does she know he's dying?

1652
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:58,205
Yeah, she knows.

1653
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:59,964
And she still said no?

1654
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,168
She's still got a lot of anger
towards your dad.

1655
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,209
But not all of it deserved.

1656
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,044
How do you figure that?

1657
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,043
She and I were young.

1658
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,002
It's never black and white
as it seems.

1659
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,561
Oh, please, Dad,
don't even start with that.

1660
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:16,721
I mean, you cheated on her.

1661
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,166
How the hell is that
somehow her fault?

1662
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,727
Can you just give him
a fucking break, please?

1663
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,882
Look, we were kids.

1664
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,570
When Dorothy was born,

1665
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,848
neither one of us had an education.

1666
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,287
We weren't prepared
to deal with life.

1667
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:34,807
And life...
just showed up,

1668
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,002
and we had to do
the best we could.

1669
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,969
Yeah, well, you know,
for some of us,

1670
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,485
- you did a good enough job.
- Mm-hmm.

1671
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,927
Yeah, for others,
you didn't do shit.

1672
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:46,004
And I apologize to you, Cyril.

1673
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,249
And you too, Sharon,

1674
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,528
and Connie,

1675
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,489
all you little ones.

1676
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,165
I wasn't there.

1677
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:58,691
It's unfortunate,

1678
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,480
for you,

1679
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,841
and me.

1680
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,810
All right.
So, we take a vote.

1681
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,645
If Mom refuses to have
Dad over for Christmas,

1682
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,724
then we have the holiday at Erin's

1683
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:18,565
and Mom is welcome to come
if she wants.

1684
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:20,404
Well, I just wanna say,

1685
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,403
that whatever you all decide,

1686
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,971
I will be having Christmas
with Mom.

1687
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,645
- Period.
- Yeah, me too.

1688
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,923
I don't care if Mom
changes her mind, Dad, but...

1689
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,206
I'm with Mom.

1690
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:33,921
Yeah, Dad, it wouldn't feel right
to leave Mom alone on Christmas.

1691
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:38,886
Okay, so, guess
there's nothing else to say.

1692
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,451
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
I had no intention

1693
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,490
of breaking this family up
at Christmas.

1694
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:46,610
What I wanted to do is
pull you all together.

1695
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:50,008
If your mother doesn't want it,
she doesn't want it.

1696
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,404
Okay?
Let's forget about Christmas.

1697
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,847
You're all here.

1698
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,769
Why can't we spend tonight...

1699
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,325
together?
It's Christmas Eve.

1700
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,084
Oh, shit, it's Christmas Eve.

1701
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:04,402
I was supposed to propose
tonight.

1702
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,847
Oh, yeah, Quinn,
that's not gonna happen.

1703
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,001
What does that mean?

1704
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,685
You better check
your messages.

1705
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,250
What does that...
What do you mean?

1706
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,041
I'm really sorry.

1707
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,247
I didn't wanna say it
when I met her,

1708
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,323
but I knew she was a gold-digger.

1709
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:22,011
Go ahead, Gerry, say it.
I know what you're thinking.

1710
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:24,242
I have no clue
what you're talking about.

1711
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,484
What about the rest of you?

1712
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:30,371
You're not stealing
Christmas Eve from Mom.

1713
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,648
Yeah, look, I gotta go.

1714
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,529
I'm gonna go help Mom
get ready.

1715
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,570
How about you?

1716
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:46,284
I should go with them, Dad.
I'm sorry.

1717
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,564
I really wish
you could be there tomorrow.

1718
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,888
I hope Mom changes her mind.

1719
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,811
Well, Erin?

1720
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,166
You're gonna stick with me, right?

1721
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,607
Sorry, Daddy,
I should get home to Aaron,

1722
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:06,128
but don't worry.
Mom's gonna change her mind.

1723
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:09,441
Okay.

1724
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,690
Listen, Dad,
I'm really sorry. I...

1725
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,446
I have to go
to a friend's house for dinner,

1726
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,841
and I'm late already.

1727
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,371
I'm sorry.

1728
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,562
I love you so much.
I hope I see you tomorrow, okay?

1729
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:25,085
Yeah, okay.

1730
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,047
I guess you reap what you sow.

1731
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:45,165
Yeah. I made a lot of mistakes
in my life, Gerry.

1732
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,329
I was a bad father.

1733
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,290
I'm not a perfect man.

1734
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,645
But God damn it,

1735
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,761
I should be able to spend
my last fucking Christmas

1736
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,485
with my family!

1737
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,126
It's not right.

1738
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,967
It's not right.

1739
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,570
I'll talk to Mom.

1740
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:25,926
Okay.

1741
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,731
Talk to Mom.

1742
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:50,167
Did you guys even know
he was sick at all?

1743
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,481
No.

1744
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:52,562
But I think it's pretty
fucking weird

1745
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,250
that Erin knew for, like, a year
and never said anything.

1746
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,050
Yeah, well,
Erin's fucking weird.

1747
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:59,170
I think we should ask Mom
to let him come for dinner.

1748
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,001
Look, call me
a cold-hearted prick.

1749
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,571
I'm not feeling that much sympathy
for him.

1750
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,961
Why? What did he do
that was so bad?

1751
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,010
He walked out on us?

1752
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:11,401
He never came to one
of our birthday parties.

1753
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,847
You know, I don't have one picture
of me and him together.

1754
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,604
Not one.

1755
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,000
Shit, he wasn't even there
the day I was born.

1756
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,690
No, I know. He didn't do shit
for me either,

1757
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,365
but he is our father,

1758
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,330
and he's gonna be gone
in a few months.

1759
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,244
And you know...

1760
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,289
I feel bad for him for that,

1761
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,807
but I don't think that's a reason
for me to forgive him.

1762
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,365
Me neither.

1763
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,525
We forgave you.

1764
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:38,405
What are you talking about?
What did I do to you?

1765
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,289
All the shit that you did
before you went to rehab?

1766
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,441
Connie.

1767
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,369
- What?
- What shit did I do?

1768
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,527
You were that fucked up
you don't--you don't remember?

1769
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,850
You lied to me,

1770
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,850
you stole from me.

1771
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,401
And that's not even
the worst of it!

1772
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,846
- Connie!
- What?

1773
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,809
We said we weren't
gonna talk about it.

1774
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:01,405
Sharon, what?
What did I do to you?

1775
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,722
You and your crackhead
friends broke into her apartment

1776
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:04,802
and trashed the place.

1777
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,606
- I did not.
- Yeah, you did.

1778
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:14,920
I'm sorry.

1779
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:16,411
It's okay. It's fine.

1780
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:19,166
You were sorry right when you did it.
It's okay.

1781
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:20,924
Sharon,
I don't remember doing that.

1782
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:24,084
I don't wanna talk about this.
We don't have to talk about it.

1783
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,925
Cyril, you're my brother.
I love you and I forgive you.

1784
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:29,924
See?

1785
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:33,163
That's all I'm saying.
You can forgive him?

1786
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,089
Can't we forgive our father?
Just one day?

1787
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,727
Just one day.
Just one fucking normal Christmas,

1788
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,484
once in my life!

1789
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:48,601
Hey, Mom.

1790
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,604
You said it would be okay
if I spent the night?

1791
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,364
Of course, baby.

1792
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,290
Are you okay?

1793
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,488
Yeah. I'm fine.

1794
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:59,051
Okay.

1795
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,565
Good night.

1796
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:03,886
Hey, Ma, where you at?

1797
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,850
Oh, my God!

1798
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:07,967
I'm back!

1799
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,565
Oh, honey!

1800
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,722
Look who I brought.

1801
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:15,089
My two babies! Come down here
and give me some sugar!

1802
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:17,083
Oh! Oh!

1803
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,930
Cyril. Hi, honey!

1804
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:21,242
Oh! Look...

1805
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,324
I can't believe you're here.

1806
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,164
What are you watching?

1807
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,288
Your father sent me this video.

1808
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,329
It's the first I've seen it.

1809
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,005
I just put the DVD in.

1810
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:33,491
Is that you guys?

1811
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:36,481
- Yeah?
- Really?

1812
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,369
Yes.
Ah!

1813
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,402
Look at your hair!

1814
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:41,846
You look like you guys actually
liked each other.

1815
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,402
Yeah, well, on that day,
we loved one another.

1816
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,329
Oh, my God.

1817
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,642
Look how handsome he is.

1818
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,689
I have to tell you guys,
you know,

1819
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,729
your father wasn't always a prick.

1820
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:56,804
Oh, he was charming.

1821
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,603
Oh, my God.

1822
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,564
We were something.

1823
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,368
I'm glad you guys
are here with me.

1824
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,760
Me too, Mom.

1825
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,285
Whoa.

1826
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:13,805
What a night.

1827
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:18,083
My girlfriend leaves me
for my sister's boyfriend and...

1828
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,204
Dad...

1829
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,362
I know.
It really hasn't even sunk in yet.

1830
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,090
He does not seem that sick.

1831
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,723
Gerry, we gotta
make this happen.

1832
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:31,201
We don't have a say in this.

1833
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,327
Did you even talk to Mom?

1834
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,363
Yeah, yeah,
of course I did.

1835
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,562
All right? And I get both
of their point of views

1836
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,404
and I'm not taking sides.

1837
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,881
Well, man, you gotta
have a horse in this race.

1838
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,041
Oh, and you think
it should be Dad's?

1839
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:44,129
- He deserves to be there.
- Does he?

1840
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,926
This is a guy who walked out
on his family.

1841
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,849
His life had changed.

1842
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,480
Overnight, he's practically a millionaire
after he sells the company.

1843
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,961
I still don't understand
how that gives you an excuse

1844
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:56,407
to walk out
on your wife and kids.

1845
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,403
We were only gonna be
holding him back.

1846
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,528
He had a dream.
He had to go for it.

1847
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:03,923
Great. So this "dream"
as you put it, can't involve us?

1848
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:07,846
You know, you say you understand
both points of view. Do you?

1849
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,411
He had to make a choice.

1850
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,921
Yeah, and he made
the wrong choice. Clearly.

1851
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,963
So, he fucked up.
He knows it.

1852
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,645
Give him a break.

1853
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,290
Think about how heartbreaking
this must be for him.

1854
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,926
Think about how heartbreaking
this must be for Mom.

1855
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:23,526
Dredging up all these old feelings again.

1856
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:25,569
I feel guilty
that I even brought it up.

1857
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,370
I wish I would've just
nipped it in the bud,

1858
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,761
told Dad it's not gonna happen.
No shot.

1859
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:33,725
Gerry, you gotta
talk to her again.

1860
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:36,762
Look, it's not up to me.

1861
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,371
This is Mom's call.

1862
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,408
I don't understand.

1863
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,164
When did this happen?

1864
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,288
Tonight at dinner.
She came over with her parents

1865
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,124
because our parents
are friends.

1866
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,281
You know,
and we got to talking.

1867
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:51,362
Oh, so that's it.

1868
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,761
You got to talking and now you're
back together again.

1869
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,729
No!
No, it's just what I told you.

1870
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,370
It's like this little
family get-together.

1871
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:58,607
But this is bullshit!

1872
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,569
I was supposed to come
to dinner with you.

1873
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:01,767
Not really, no.

1874
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,570
You kind of invited yourself.

1875
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:04,801
I did not!

1876
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,927
Yeah. Yeah, you did.

1877
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,844
I just didn't know
how to say no to you.

1878
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,331
This is unbelievable.

1879
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,767
So I can't come in
for dinner with you.

1880
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,570
She has all her nieces
and nephews here.

1881
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:15,643
It's a whole Christmas thing.
Look at me!

1882
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,370
Huh.

1883
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,249
I'm a fucking idiot.

1884
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,731
Johnny, what are you doing?

1885
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:23,165
Who's this you're talking to?

1886
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,561
Hey...
How you doing, baby?

1887
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,161
Oh... Nobody.
It's just, uh... It's just...

1888
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,402
A lady I work for.

1889
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,686
I'm just a lady he works for.

1890
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,844
And I had to bring
his Christmas bonus by,

1891
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,082
for being such a good boy,

1892
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:39,720
cutting my grass all year.

1893
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:41,924
No worries, sweetheart.

1894
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:45,851
Seriously?

1895
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,689
Teresa. Hold on.

1896
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:56,129
We're so lucky
to have him.

1897
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:58,846
He's the man.

1898
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:02,886
You know, I know we said
we'd have a few kids,

1899
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:06,203
but I think I'm good
with this little guy.

1900
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:08,522
Big families are overrated.

1901
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,010
Especially yours.

1902
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:22,208
I'm sorry I've been
being such a bitch lately.

1903
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,561
You wanna talk about it?

1904
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:28,361
It's my father.

1905
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:32,208
He's been sick and he didn't
want me to tell anyone.

1906
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:33,805
Sick? How sick? How?

1907
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,926
He's only got a couple of months.

1908
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:41,090
- Hey... Hey, it's okay.
- I'm so sorry I didn't...

1909
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:43,049
He made me promise
not to tell anyone.

1910
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,247
Oh.

1911
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,641
It's okay, it's okay.

1912
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:48,410
Erin, it's okay. Hey.

1913
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,247
So, we good?
You gonna call Sharon?

1914
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:58,449
Yes, I will call
and I will apologize

1915
01:28:58,640 --> 01:28:59,641
and tell her I was wrong

1916
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,404
and next time I'll learn to keep
my big mouth shut.

1917
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,921
Well, you weren't wrong.
The guy is a fucking creep.

1918
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,811
But sometimes, even when you're right,
you gotta apologize.

1919
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,840
Ah, this is me.

1920
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,765
All right, look. Are you okay
to drive all the way back to the city?

1921
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:12,921
You didn't drink too much?

1922
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:14,047
I'm only going down the block.

1923
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,765
Gonna stay at Mom's tonight.
I'm not going back to the city.

1924
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:16,921
You wanna come with me?

1925
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:20,283
No, no, no. I'm going to go
meet this girl for a drink actually.

1926
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,488
Ooh! Gonna meet this girl
for a drink?

1927
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:25,564
Congratulations.
Little Yuletide booty call, is it?

1928
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:26,642
Oh, we'll see about that.

1929
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,245
Enjoy yourself.
Come on.

1930
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:29,606
- Bye, brother.
- All right.

1931
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:30,767
Good night, man.

1932
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,162
- Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

1933
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:34,446
Hey, Santa.

1934
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:38,122
Don't hurt yourself
going down the chimney.

1935
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:50,721
Hello?

1936
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:53,087
Hey, Sharon, it's, uh, Gerry.

1937
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,281
Hey.

1938
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,603
Yeah, look,
I just wanted to call...

1939
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:01,923
I-I-I know
you're upset with me and...

1940
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,207
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

1941
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:07,125
I shouldn't have said that stupid shit
about your boyfriend.

1942
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,681
So, I was totally out of line.

1943
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:13,248
Yeah, well, with all the crazy shit
that's going on with our family right now,

1944
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:14,606
that is small potatoes.

1945
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,882
No, no, no.
It's um, I, you know, I-I-I...

1946
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,042
I should learn to keep
my big mouth shut.

1947
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,645
I mean,
it's none of my business.

1948
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,325
All right.

1949
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,931
So we're good?

1950
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:27,731
Yeah. Yeah, we're good.

1951
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:30,406
All right then. Then I guess I'll...
I'll see you tomorrow.

1952
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,164
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

1953
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:34,441
Merry Christmas.

1954
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:36,011
Yeah. Merry Christmas.

1955
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:38,009
- Hey, Gerry?
- Yeah.

1956
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:40,966
I love you.

1957
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:43,525
I love you, too.

1958
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,369
Hi. Door's okay?

1959
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:17,567
Go around. It's open.

1960
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:18,801
Okay.

1961
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,521
<i>- Hey.</i>

1962
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:30,411
God, am I happy to see you.

1963
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:31,561
How'd it go?

1964
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:33,210
It's still a mess, but...

1965
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,245
Thanks for doing this.

1966
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:07,447
Thank you for coming.

1967
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:10,763
I'm... I'm sorry for everything
I've put you through this past year.

1968
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,121
I promise, never again.

1969
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:13,202
All right.

1970
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:14,486
- I'll be right back.
- Good luck in there.

1971
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:15,971
Thank you.

1972
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:27,251
Gonna get a new boyfriend?

1973
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:28,811
Mom, Mom,
take our picture.

1974
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:33,040
Oh, my God,
what is going on here?

1975
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:35,487
You gotta go get your pj's on.
We're taking photos.

1976
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:37,961
It's gonna have to wait.
I got Aaron and Corey waiting in the car.

1977
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:39,406
I just came to drop off
the presents.

1978
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:41,961
We're gonna drive out
to Connecticut for a few hours,

1979
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:45,488
and spend some time with his dad
and the new goy wife.

1980
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:47,483
Good luck.

1981
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:49,881
- Yeah.
- Oh, look at this!

1982
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,208
- Erin.
- Hi, Gerry!

1983
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:53,725
I got the bagels.

1984
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:55,001
Bagels!

1985
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:56,446
I got the bagels.

1986
01:32:56,600 --> 01:33:00,082
Kris Kringle, I heard you crawled in
last night at 6 A.M.

1987
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:01,730
You wanna share some details,
Romeo?

1988
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,166
Uh... No.

1989
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:04,924
I didn't know
you were seeing someone.

1990
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,889
Well, yeah. I kinda...
I met somebody.

1991
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,644
What's her name?
We're gonna meet her today?

1992
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,928
You will probably meet this woman.

1993
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:12,161
No, she's not coming by today.

1994
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,162
Well!

1995
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:15,721
Merry Christmas, everybody.
I will see you later.

1996
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:18,565
Well, look, look, Erin.
Before you go,

1997
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,963
Mom has a little something
she wants to talk to all of us about.

1998
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:26,003
Uh, yeah.
Oh... Okay. Um...

1999
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:30,046
I... I just...
just wanted everybody to know that

2000
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,407
if your father
survives this cancer,

2001
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:35,245
he will not be invited back
next year.

2002
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,767
Invited back?
What are you talking about?

2003
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:40,327
I talked to him this morning.

2004
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:43,051
He's--He's coming out
on the 11 :00 train

2005
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:44,361
and joining us for Mass,

2006
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:47,205
and if he behaves himself,

2007
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:48,805
he can stay for dinner.

2008
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,610
Thank you, Mom.

2009
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:52,205
Oh, that's so good you're doing.

2010
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:54,283
Well, look,
it's a couple of hours, right?

2011
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:56,289
I mean, how bad can it be?

2012
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,960
You two okay with this?

2013
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:00,201
Yeah, we talked about it.

2014
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,880
We told Mom this morning
that we thought it'd be okay.

2015
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:04,405
Yeah, well,
Corey's waiting for you

2016
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:07,370
and I'm going to get
the old man at the train now.

2017
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:08,726
- Bye.
- Thank you, Gerr.

2018
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,245
All right, guys-

2019
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,488
This is a big day.
I'm gonna go get dressed.

2020
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:16,051
And I recommend
you do the same.

2021
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:17,725
Get out of your
Tiny Tim costume.

2022
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:20,527
Look at this, look at this.

2023
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:21,920
Oh, look at these buttons.

2024
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,241
it won't button.

2025
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,209
Wait. No, no, no.
You can't have two bagels.

2026
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:26,930
- You want a bagel, Mommy?
- Yeah. I think...

2027
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:28,286
But somebody else
better cut it.

2028
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:30,010
My hands are
shaking too bad for it.

2029
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:31,571
You want some more, Ma?

2030
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:37,690
Hey, Pops.

2031
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,922
Hey, Gerr.

2032
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,491
Hey, how are you?

2033
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:43,085
Merry Christmas.

2034
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:45,645
- Let me take that from you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

2035
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,285
- You ready to do this?
- Yeah.

2036
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:03,969
Oh! There he is.

2037
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,529
Merry Christmas, Dad.

Merry Christmas, Son.

2039
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:39,766
Hello, Rosie.

2040
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,962
Let me look at you,

2041
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:48,610
you stupid son of a bitch.

2042
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,685
Are you truly sorry
for all you've done?

2043
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:01,685
Yes, I am.

2044
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:04,570
I still don't believe you.

2045
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:10,886
But you are
officially welcome

2046
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:12,963
back into this family.

2047
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:18,765
Thanks, hon.

2048
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:22,565
All right.

2049
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:25,200
Let's all go to Mass
and pray for your father.
