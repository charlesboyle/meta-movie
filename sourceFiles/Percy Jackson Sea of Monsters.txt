1
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,826
<i>At first, I didn't
believe it either.</i>

2
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,506
<i>But the gods of
Olympus are real.</i>

3
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,022
<i>And sometimes, these gods
have children with humans...</i>

4
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,023
<i>called half-bloods.</i>

5
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,591
<i>I'm one of them.</i>

6
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,825
<i>I'm Percy Jackson. Son of
Poseidon, God of the sea.</i>

7
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,866
<i>Seven years ago, four
of these children</i>

8
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,631
<i>were headed to
Camp Half-Blood...</i>

9
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,387
<i>the only place on Earth
that is safe for our kind.</i>

10
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,143
<i>Only three of them made it.</i>

11
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,030
We're almost at camp!

12
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,266
Look out!

13
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,503
Grover! Luke, help him!

14
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,547
Grover, are you okay?

15
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,748
My leg. It's stuck.

16
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,751
Come on. I got you.

17
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,424
Keep going. I'll
hold them off.

18
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,629
No, Thalia. They'll kill you.

19
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,621
Go, Luke. I'll be
right behind you.

20
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,630
Over here!

21
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,225
Annabeth, come on!

22
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,504
Stay back.

23
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,191
Thalia, come on!

24
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,270
No! Thalia!

25
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,711
<i>Her name was Thalia, and
she gave her life to save three.</i>

26
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,061
<i>And so, as Thalia lay dying...</i>

27
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,509
<i>her father Zeus found another
way for her to live.</i>

28
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,911
<i>A way for all
half-bloods to live.</i>

29
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:36,942
<i>A gift to ensure no one in Camp
Half-Blood would die the same way.</i>

30
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,786
<i>The barrier, to protect them from
those who lived for their death.</i>

31
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,911
Let's go!

32
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,024
<i>Every day, the story of
Thalia's bravery inspires me.</i>

33
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,501
<i>And her tree protects my home.</i>

34
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,184
<i>But not always my head.</i>

35
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,743
How nice of you to show
up just to watch me win.

36
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,744
Everything they say about
you is wrong, Clarisse.

37
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,868
You actually do have
a sense of humor.

38
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,071
There goes another one.

39
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,466
Go, Percy!

40
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,423
Come on, Percy! I got
50 drachma on you!

41
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,831
You bet on this?

42
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,664
What, is that wrong?

43
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,781
Oh!

44
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,665
'97 Xinomavro. Would
you like a taste?

45
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,461
Why do you torture
yourself, Dionysus?

46
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,308
It was one transgression, one.

47
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,940
And with a naiad, for
the sake of Olympus.

48
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,182
How was I to know that
Zeus had a thing for her?

49
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,582
Or that he could hold
a grudge for so long?

50
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,508
I think the fact
that Zeus is immortal...

51
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,743
means there's no limit to how
long he can hold a grudge.

52
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,864
The Christians have a guy who
can do this trick in reverse.

53
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,590
Now, that's a God.

54
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,304
Aren't you tired of
getting beat, Jackson?

55
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,627
Clarisse!

56
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,023
Help! Help me!

57
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,350
Tereus, grab my hand!

58
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,028
Good luck with that.

59
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,581
I got you.

60
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,381
Thank you!

61
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,701
Percy!

62
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,384
Clarisse!
Clarisse! Clarisse!

63
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,749
So, what I'm wondering
is, Percy...

64
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,871
that first quest you went on,
beginner's luck, wasn't it?

65
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,585
Clarisse, he saved Olympus. That's
more than you've ever done.

66
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,781
Whatever.

67
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,147
Even for the daughter of the God
of war, that girl's a mythic bi...

68
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,466
Don't listen to her, Percy.

69
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,269
You know, it's too late.

70
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,627
Besides, she has a point.

71
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,384
Dude, what are you
talking about?

72
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,542
You're more than a
one-quest wonder.

73
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,702
You recovered Ares'
stolen chariot.

74
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,101
No, actually, that
was Clarisse.

75
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,659
Okay, what about the Fall Tournament?
You owned that sucker.

76
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,661
Mmm-mmm.

77
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,829
Clarisse? Mmm-hmm.

78
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,790
Okay, the Solstice Games?
The Bronze Dragon's Quest?

79
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,740
Thank you for trying
to cheer me up.

80
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,665
I would lick a pair
of cloven hooves...

81
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,708
before I let you listen to
Clarisse instead of us.

82
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,781
No offense, Grover.

83
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,703
None taken. Is that an offer?

84
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,067
Listen, it doesn't matter
what Clarisse has done.

85
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,541
To Chiron and Mr. D, you're
still the rock star.

86
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,429
Perry Johnson!

87
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,948
Actually, it's Percy
Jackson, sir.

88
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,141
Whatever.

89
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,951
I have a very important
task to entrust you with.

90
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,107
You do?

91
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,184
Yes, it's a critical assignment.
And it's very taxing.

92
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,500
Can I trust you?

93
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,581
Of course.

94
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,742
Good. You'll need this.

95
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,269
Sometimes these events
get a little messy.

96
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,824
<i>Maybe
Clarisse was right.</i>

97
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,661
Maybe I only stopped Luke
from destroying Olympus...

98
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,823
because I had Annabeth and
Grover helping me, right?

99
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,905
Dad?

100
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,829
Poseidon?

101
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,261
Have you ever felt like
everything you've ever done...

102
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,422
maybe you didn't really do it?

103
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,747
It was all just
luck or something?

104
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,542
No, of course not.

105
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,225
You're a God.

106
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,548
Speaking as someone
who's not, it sucks.

107
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,746
It makes you question whether you
were all that good to begin with.

108
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,945
Okay. Good not talking to you.

109
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,587
Again.

110
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:38,227
So, he just walked right in? He
just walked straight into camp?

111
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,302
It seems he
lumbered, actually.

112
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,502
I don't care if he sashayed!

113
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,344
What's the point of
having this mystical

114
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,184
protective barrier if
any thing can just...

115
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,625
Could you not touch
that, please?

116
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,105
That's a very
precious Grenache.

117
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,181
I think the point is...

118
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,429
since he did pass right through
the barrier from Thalia's tree...

119
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,107
Don't say it... it means he's
most likely a God-spawn.

120
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,821
Yeah, but the spawn
of which God?

121
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,749
I know.

122
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,310
Poseidon.

123
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,705
So, why did Mr. D summon you?
It's not good to get summoned.

124
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,066
I'm sure it's fine.

125
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,585
I'm sure you don't get
summoned to the Big House

126
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,946
without a major-league
screw-up.

127
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,181
I didn't screw up.

128
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,701
I cleaned the entire coliseum.
And vacuumed.

129
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,782
Don't let him get
into your head, okay?

130
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,750
We have a dead camper walking.
Dead camper walking, here.

131
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,663
Thanks. This is friendship.

132
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,709
I'm just playing, just
trying to have a little fun.

133
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,066
It's all right.

134
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,268
So, it's okay if I get your
cabin when you get kicked out?

135
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,707
Seriously, don't worry.
It's just Mr. D.

136
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,023
I mean, if Chiron had
summoned you, then“.

137
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,821
Oh, you are so
massively screwed.

138
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,589
Whatever it is you think
I did, I didn't do it.

139
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,230
You've done nothing, Percy.

140
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,540
Exactly.

141
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,149
As you know, you are believed
to be Poseidon's only heir.

142
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,026
Yeah, so?

143
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,344
So, it would seem that belief
has been held in error.

144
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,582
Hold on. You're saying
Percy has a brother?

145
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,230
Or a sister.

146
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,029
Holy Styx. Another
Poseidon half-blood.

147
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,825
Not exactly.

148
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,500
Technically, Tyson
is not a half-blood.

149
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,947
Half-bloods are half-human,
hence the name.

150
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,260
I don't get it.

151
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,662
If this new kid is not half-human,
then what other half is he?

152
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,947
Nymph. Sea nymph.

153
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,262
And when you cross a deity
with a nymph, you get...

154
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,025
Don't touch. It's
a Gewurztraminer.

155
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,466
Hi.

156
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,545
Hi, Brother.

157
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,183
So, you're the big shot here, right?
You saved the world and stuff.

158
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,388
Yeah. Yeah.

159
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,589
Hey, they put peppers in yours.
Are you gonna eat that?

160
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,951
Go ahead.

161
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,709
Is he messing with me?

162
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,146
I think he's hungry.

163
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,302
No, not him. I meant Poseidon.

164
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,349
Is this supposed to
be some kind of joke?

165
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,742
A half-brother? A Cyclops?
Come on.

166
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,868
I think the politically correct
term is "ocularly impaired."

167
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,505
And a half-brother is
better than nothing.

168
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,025
I like having a brother.

169
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,704
Dad was cool to bring me here.

170
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,101
Dad? Dad brought you here?
Uh-huh.

171
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,189
I was upstate, in the woods.

172
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,470
One day, this trident shows up over my
head, and then it started moving South.

173
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,101
And you followed it.
You followed it here.

174
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,105
It glowed.

175
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,309
Well, somebody has
got a new brother.

176
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,750
And I can see he's got
his Daddy's eyes.

177
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,901
Well...

178
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,621
"Eye."

179
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,107
You should really get him
some sprayable mist.

180
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,346
Anyway, it is kind of interesting
timing, don't you think?

181
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,461
Maybe Poseidon decided he needed
another son to, you know...

182
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,746
represent.

183
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,311
Bull.

184
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,951
Excuse me?

185
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,431
Smells like bull.

186
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,670
We got barrier action.

187
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,984
Hey, Chris, you coming?

188
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,302
No, I'm good.

189
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,824
That is so awesome.

190
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,545
It's chill. The
barrier is holding.

191
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,701
A Colchis bull.

192
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,026
Run!

193
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,061
Percy!

194
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,227
Come on!

195
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,943
We have to find its weak spot.
Does it have one?

196
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,068
Percy, distract it for me.

197
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,981
Hey!

198
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,741
Hey!

199
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,270
I got this.

200
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,587
Bad bull.

201
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,661
Hey, rust bucket!

202
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,142
Damn it, Jackson.

203
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,148
Do you have any idea how hard
Colchis bulls are to come by?

204
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,791
Maybe next time you try
to drown someone...

205
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,747
you'll first make sure he's
not a demigod who can swim.

206
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,181
Luke?

207
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,787
Turns out, you're not the only
half-blood who's hard to kill.

208
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,588
You know, prophecy.

209
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,865
What prophecy? What are
you talking about?

210
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,510
You don't know?

211
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,307
Huh.

212
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:45,343
Add that to the long list of things your
buddy Chiron hasn't shared with you.

213
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,509
Chiron, Mr. D, all the rest...

214
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,622
they don't care about us.

215
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,944
To them, we're just kids.

216
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,422
A bunch of pawns meant to be
pushed around, told what to do.

217
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,260
I'm not the only
half-blood who thinks so.

218
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,466
Think about it.

219
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,220
What did I miss?

220
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,540
Where's Percy?

221
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,749
Last time I saw him, he was getting
dragged by a Colchis bull.

222
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,709
Hey, you.

223
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,465
How come you aren't barbecued?

224
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,110
Cyclopes are fireproof.

225
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,660
How did the bull get
through the barrier?

226
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,983
Oh, my gods.

227
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,151
Poisoned.

228
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,223
Is she... is the tree dead?

229
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,030
No, but dying.

230
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,423
A condition we're about to
become all too familiar with.

231
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,905
Everybody, we're going to need a guard
detail to patrol the perimeter.

232
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,984
It feels like she's
dying all over again.

233
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,188
Who would do this?

234
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,864
Luke poisoned the tree.

235
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,031
Percy!

236
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,149
Yay, you're alive.

237
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,061
Yeah, I'm not the only one.

238
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,185
Luke let the bull in.

239
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,785
Without the tree's barrier...

240
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,629
he probably figures there's
enough Demi-Titans

241
00:20:37,642 --> 00:20:39,421
out there to get
him what he wants.

242
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,741
And that would be
what, exactly?

243
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,145
Our annihilation, Ms. La Rue.

244
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,782
Our annihilation.

245
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,391
How's the antidote coming?

246
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,746
Slowly.

247
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,586
I know this probably
isn't the best time...

248
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,390
but there's something
I have to ask you.

249
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,825
What is it?

250
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,431
It was something Luke
said about a prophecy...

251
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,582
how I'm mentioned in it.

252
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,462
Do you know anything
about this?

253
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,031
Knowledge isn't
always power, Percy.

254
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,828
Sometimes, it's a burden.

255
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,024
I know that.

256
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,029
But like you said, I've been
pretty unexceptional lately.

257
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,264
It's got me wondering
if I'm prophecy-worthy.

258
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,747
They say that when the
gods wish to torture us...

259
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,629
they answer our prayers.

260
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,466
Necklace of Harmonia,
Hercules' bow, Golden Apple of Discord.

261
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,424
Three millennia of
gods and demigods...

262
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,583
you'd think that someone would have
come up with a cure for Thalia's tree.

263
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,509
Persephone did
come up with Miracle-Gro.

264
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:52,381
Maybe we can try that.

265
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,826
That's it.

266
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,391
Right here.

267
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,903
That is not gonna cure Thalia's
tree so much as get us all killed.

268
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,220
Me, in particular.

269
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,144
It's perfect. It's
exactly what we need.

270
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,105
I'm taking this to Mr. D.

271
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,306
No.

272
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,906
I was hoping to spare you this onus a
little while longer, but go inside.

273
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,505
Upstairs, to the attic.

274
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,060
And when you come back down,
we'll talk some more.

275
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,905
Assuming you're still
sane, that is.

276
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,380
I am the spirit of Delphi...

277
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,384
speaker of the prophecies
of Phoebus Apollo...

278
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,861
slayer of the mighty Python.

279
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,706
Approach, seeker, and ask.

280
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,506
I heard there was a
prophecy about me.

281
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,071
Aye.

282
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:22,067
But before you learn the
future, know first the past.

283
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,387
<i>Long ago, before our time...</i>

284
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,622
<i>before Olympus and the gods...</i>

285
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,068
<i>Titans ruled the world.</i>

286
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,349
<i>Led by Kronos...</i>

287
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,943
<i>a force so evil, he
devoured his own children.</i>

288
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,626
<i>But three of his sons escaped.</i>

289
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,068
<i>Zeus, Hades and Poseidon.</i>

290
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,670
<i>They destroyed Kronos...</i>

291
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:57,382
<i>and banished his remains
to the depths of Tartarus.</i>

292
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,264
<i>But Kronos is fated
to rise again...</i>

293
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:07,187
<i>to exact his vengeance on
Olympus, and the world.</i>

294
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:14,271
<i>Only one half-blood child of the
three eldest gods can defeat him.</i>

295
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,708
<i>This child shall be
our salvation...</i>

296
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:21,023
<i>or the 'cause of
our destruction.</i>

297
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,308
<i>It all begins when two cousins
grapple for a fleece...</i>

298
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,664
<i>the son of the sea and
the lightning thief.</i>

299
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,626
Luke.

300
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,306
And that half-blood
of the eldest gods...

301
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,464
shall reach 20
against all odds.

302
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,908
"And see the world
in endless sleep..."

303
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,860
"the evil soul, cursed
blade shall reap."

304
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,909
"A single choice shall
end his days..."

305
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,348
"Olympus to preserve or raze."

306
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,982
And that is "raze" with
a as in "destroy."

307
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,985
I asked.

308
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,391
Is there any chance,
any chance at all...

309
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,828
that I might not be the
guy in the prophecy?

310
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,824
The Oracle references a
half-blood of the eldest gods.

311
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:16,066
You are the only living half-blood
heir of Zeus, Hades or Poseidon.

312
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,541
The prophecy could
refer only to you.

313
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,341
What if I destroy Olympus...

314
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,663
by not being good
enough to save it?

315
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,180
That seems to be the
question, doesn't it?

316
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,150
Mr. D: It's absolutely
out of the question.

317
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,984
If you could just listen
to me for one moment...

318
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,028
lam listening. You
want to go on a quest.

319
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,431
Oh! It must be Thursday.

320
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,305
I'm serious. I'm absolutely
sure that this is gonna work.

321
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,469
It was such a good year.

322
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,226
The Golden Fleece can heal any
living person or thing...

323
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,661
including Thalia's tree.

324
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,983
We heal the tree, we restore
the barrier around camp.

325
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,346
I'm surprised you want to go along
with her on this, Mr. Undershirt.

326
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,421
Underwood.

327
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,661
Whatever.

328
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,507
Every satyr who has ever gone
after the Fleece has died.

329
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,186
Right? I mentioned
that to her.

330
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,826
But it's a risk I'm willing to
take for the good of the camp.

331
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,827
Look, the last I heard...

332
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,665
the Golden Fleece was in
the Sea of Monsters...

333
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,822
what the humans call
the Bermuda Triangle.

334
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,301
A place not only a satyr
should be afraid of.

335
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:24,101
So, the answer is no. No.
I'm sorry, Annabelle.

336
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,181
Annabeth.

337
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,469
Whatever. It's a
terrible idea.

338
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,066
I've had a grand idea.

339
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,380
Unless Thalia's tree
can be cured...

340
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,704
and the protective barrier
around our camp restored...

341
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,546
then every demigod,
centaur, satyr and nymph...

342
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,427
will be killed within
days, if not sooner.

343
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,229
Hey, you okay?

344
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,340
Don't worry, camp
will be okay.

345
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,829
You have to have faith, right?

346
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,506
But fortunately, I have
considered the matter.

347
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,261
And after great study...

348
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,990
I have determined
that the only thing

349
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,704
that has the power to
save Thalia's tree...

350
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,544
and therefore our home...

351
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,668
is the Golden
Fleece of myth...

352
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,181
What?

353
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,146
...whose touch...

354
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,224
...can heal every
person and every thing.

355
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:22,790
So, a quest, a mission
of mercy, if you will...

356
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,420
into uncharted and
deadly waters...

357
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,829
with nothing less at stake
than our own survival.

358
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:35,149
Now, a satyr is naturally drawn, as
you know, to the power of the Fleece.

359
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,385
And therefore, it must be a satyr who
will guide a half-blood on this quest.

360
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,230
Thanks a lot.

361
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,781
Ichneutae!

362
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,588
Will you guide the champion?

363
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,469
Oh, yeah.

364
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,464
Good. Great! That's great!

365
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,821
Yeah!

366
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:00,820
As to who that champion might be, our
plight calls for only our finest hero.

367
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,744
The best of us, the
strongest and the bravest.

368
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,627
The scion of the God of war...
Clarisse!

369
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,221
Yes!

370
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,061
Thank you.

371
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,065
Her name, he gets right.

372
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,068
Hey, Clarisse.
Clarisse!

373
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,949
What? Oh.

374
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,466
Don't worry about always
coming in second, Jackson.

375
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,110
You do get used to it.

376
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,228
I think, right? Obviously,
I wouldn't know.

377
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,619
Listen, Luke is
still out there.

378
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,021
He's involved with the
Fleece somehow...

379
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,866
and I've got a feeling
that he's not done yet.

380
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,941
Really?

381
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,785
Because I've got a feeling
that I don't really care.

382
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,703
Gosh, don't look so wounded.

383
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,221
Listen, there are generals,
and there are foot soldiers.

384
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,463
And you should feel lucky that you
even made it into the army at all.

385
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,147
Just try not to screw up anything
too badly while I'm gone. Okay?

386
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,347
Let's go.

387
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,831
"Cursed blade shall reap."

388
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,548
"Cursed blade shall reap."

389
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,620
What good is a prophecy if you
can't even understand it?

390
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,790
I guess you don't have
any answers either, Dad.

391
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,910
This was your sword.

392
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,261
This is a bad idea.

393
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,671
You don't even know
what I was gonna say.

394
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,220
You were going to say that you're going
after the Fleece to save the camp.

395
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,826
Actually, he was
gonna say "we" were.

396
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,187
Look, I get what
you're doing here.

397
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,905
You're worried about the
one-quest wonder thing...

398
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,709
and you want to
make your bones.

399
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,942
But Ichneutae and Clarisse are
already going after the Fleece...

400
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,421
and it's not cool to bogart
on someone else's quest.

401
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,309
I think this is my quest, too.

402
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,189
The Oracle says he wrestles
Luke for the Fleece.

403
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,548
"Grapples." But
she also said...

404
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,709
that I'm destined to destroy
Olympus, or save it.

405
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,187
Saving is better, obviously.

406
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,830
Yeah.

407
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:25,142
Let me pack a bag and make sure
my health insurance is paid up.

408
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,902
How are we gonna
get past them?

409
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,983
I think they're looking for
threats trying to come in...

410
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,506
not people trying
to sneak out...

411
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,140
so, I think we're cool as
long as we stay quiet.

412
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,661
Sorry!

413
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,421
Shh!

414
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,181
We're...

415
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,070
We're guarding, too.

416
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,501
You left without me.

417
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,345
Tyson, where we're going,
it's very dangerous.

418
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,945
I know. I'm not stupid.

419
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,351
No, just dumb.

420
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,951
I want to help.

421
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,870
You'd do it for me.

422
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,590
I appreciate that...

423
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,631
but I don't think you understand exactly
how dangerous this is going to be.

424
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,861
I do.

425
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,988
The Fleece is guarded
by Polyphemus.

426
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,467
Who?

427
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,701
Polyphemus.

428
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,545
Closest thing Cyclopes have
got to someone famous.

429
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,908
Captured Odysseus.
Lives in Circeland.

430
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,590
Wait, Circeland?

431
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,710
Built on his island.
Long story.

432
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,062
Point is, maybe I
can talk to him.

433
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,222
You know, Cyclops to Cyclops.

434
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,304
No, you can't, because I'm
not going with a Cyclops.

435
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,983
Then we got a problem, because
I'm not going without one.

436
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:54,504
This Polyphemus is probably what killed
every satyr that's gone near the Fleece.

437
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,548
You want me to lead you
to a Cyclops? Fine.

438
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,908
But I'm bringing along one
of my own, for protection.

439
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,820
No way.

440
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,307
No.

441
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,183
What do you think's gonna
attract more attention...

442
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,830
all the noise or the one eye?

443
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,902
Just give the guy
a break, okay?

444
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,581
Okay, fine.

445
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,661
Shh! Keep it down.

446
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,027
This is crazy
hard to come by...

447
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,182
and I only brought it along
in case of an emergency...

448
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:29,504
which I guess this is an
emergency, so... here.

449
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,147
Mist?

450
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,348
It makes the mystical
look normal.

451
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,661
"Side effects may include
handsomeness, headache,"

452
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,583
"self-esteem and
low self-esteem."

453
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,659
And just know that if the
camp wasn't in danger...

454
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,025
I wouldn't be wasting
this on you.

455
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,511
Wasting what?

456
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,942
It's not gonna last forever.
You're gonna have to reapply it.

457
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,067
Extreme makeover alert.
Whoop, whoop!

458
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,311
How do I look?

459
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,031
A bit like Dad, actually.

460
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,182
He's still a Cyclops.

461
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:16,142
Grover, where are we going?
What does your nose say?

462
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,745
Uh, somewhere off the
coast of Florida. South.

463
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,941
Over here.

464
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,590
Annie! Hey!

465
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,628
It's the Chariot of Damnation.

466
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,942
Looks like a New
York City cab.

467
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,465
Same difference.

468
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,424
No dollars, no credit cards.
Drachmas only.

469
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,389
Exact... Change... Please.

470
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,224
Chop, chop! Get in the cab.

471
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,190
We just had this cab sanitized
for your protection.

472
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,705
It wasn't this year, though.

473
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,942
Excuse me, we're trying
to get to Florida.

474
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,546
Our kind of fare.
Pricey.

475
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,821
Whoa!

476
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,710
<i>Hey, there. This is Ganymede,
cupbearer to Zeus.</i>

477
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,261
<i>And when I'm out buying wine
for the lord of the skies...</i>

478
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,229
<i>I always remember
to buckle up.</i>

479
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,587
Maybe we should have
flown commercial.

480
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,101
Look out!

481
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,342
Calm down. If we didn't
know what we were doing...

482
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,104
We wouldn't be licensed.

483
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,545
They don't have eyes.

484
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,786
Yeah.

485
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,462
I know, awful picture.
Bad hair day.

486
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,991
We do so have an eye.

487
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,744
It's around here somewhere.

488
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,141
The last time I saw
it, you put it

489
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,506
in the glove
compartment, Anger.

490
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,991
Don't use that
tone with my name.

491
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,869
It's not there this time.

492
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,941
Ah!

493
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,587
Wasp always puts
it with the keys.

494
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,471
And it's 20/20.

495
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,911
So is mine!

496
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,188
Shouldn't the
driver get the eye?

497
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,904
She'll be fine.

498
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,551
Tempest, split!

499
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,461
Percy!

500
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,263
We paid extra for that option.

501
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,511
The kid is right. The driver
should have the eyeball.

502
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,786
He's a freaking genius!

503
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,305
You're the one that
put it in the visor.

504
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,390
While it's on the table, I haven't
had a turn in quite some time.

505
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,824
Oh, no, you didn't!

506
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,141
Yes, I did.

507
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,830
Hands on the wheel
at least, okay?

508
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,350
We're all gonna die!
Pipe down.

509
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,742
Didn't that prophecy say you're
gonna make it till at least 20?

510
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,019
You know about the prophecy?

511
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,749
Oh, sure. The
Oracle is a friend.

512
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,749
We're besties. ALL: B-F-F!

513
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,221
Ugh!

514
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,540
Eye! Eye! Eye!

515
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,663
Gross! Get it off me!

516
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,827
What do you know
about the prophecy?

517
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,781
No!

518
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,186
Okay, Okay.

519
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:19,269
30, 31, 75, 12.

520
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,421
What?

521
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,264
Percy, you got your answer!

522
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,910
All I got were numbers.

523
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,304
Yes. You'll know...
When it matters.

524
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,269
I think we're a little
short on drachmas.

525
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,341
What?

526
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,225
What do you... think we're...
running here?

527
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,267
A charity?

528
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,865
Get your cheap butts...
ALL: Out!

529
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,866
That was... I know.

530
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,384
Awesome! Can we go again?

531
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,668
We're definitely
not in Florida.

532
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,226
I think we're in Olympus.

533
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,148
Hail to you, great Zeus! Forgive
our trespass on Olympus.

534
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,985
We're seeking
transport to Florida.

535
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,741
Zeus?

536
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,381
Zeus?

537
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,901
Zeus?

538
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,109
Whoa, stop it, stop it, stop it!
This isn't Olympus, okay?

539
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,830
This is the Capitol building.

540
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,744
We're in Washington, D.C.
Okay?

541
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,501
Oh.

542
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,141
It looks like Olympus.

543
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,144
Right down to the dudes with power
who only care about themselves.

544
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,103
We need to
find a bus station.

545
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,860
First we need
to get some money.

546
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,821
<i>Hey, there, valued
half-blood account holder!</i>

547
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,399
<i>Sign up for our new Aphrodite
Express credit card...</i>

548
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,981
<i>And you can...</i>

549
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:58,110
Can I get four venti
half-caf no-whip lattes?

550
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,070
And an extra shot of nectar.

551
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,301
Nectar?

552
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,224
If you haven't had, then
you haven't lived, buddy.

553
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,304
Hecatonshire.

554
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,030
Hey. Whoa.

555
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,702
I see you got your hands full.

556
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,791
Room for cream?

557
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,943
Nectar. Double shot.

558
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,110
I've lived.

559
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,426
This might be the most
fun I've ever had.

560
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,786
Even.

561
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,467
Yeah, anything's gotta be better
than living in the woods, right?

562
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,066
Living in the woods would have
been fine if you were there.

563
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,302
Everything's better
with a brother.

564
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,905
You know, technically, we
don't have the same Mom.

565
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,621
So we're still brothers! I know!
How cool is that?

566
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,145
Arctic.

567
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,265
It's too
sweet, don't you think?

568
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,661
No, nectar's
never too sweet.

569
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,750
Get off me!

570
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,023
Get off me! Grover!

571
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,307
Percy!

572
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,342
Damn! Was that
Chris Rodriguez?

573
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,269
HOW did they do that?

574
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:41,346
Back at camp, Luke said that there
were other half-bloods who turned.

575
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,184
What do you mean, "turned"?

576
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,430
To his side.

577
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,624
Luke has Grover.

578
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,549
The Oracle was right.

579
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,022
Luke is going after the Fleece.
That's why he needs a satyr.

580
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,144
But what does Luke want
with the Fleece anyway?

581
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,301
I don't know.

582
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,542
But if we're gonna get Grover
back, we need to find Luke.

583
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,985
But we don't know where he is.

584
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,705
I know someone who does.
Come on.

585
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:20,102
What, are we shipping ourselves overnight
express to the Sea of Monsters?

586
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,389
You want to find Luke? His
Dad will know where he is.

587
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,031
Olympic Parcel Service.
Come on.

588
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:36,429
Like it? He'll love it. Yes,
Hephaestus does do quality work.

589
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,349
Everyone else these
days, hacks.

590
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,149
Excuse me, we're
looking for Hermes.

591
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,190
I'm sorry to be the God of
obviousness, but I'm with a customer.

592
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,628
You want an overnight shipment to
Hades, that will be 250 drachmas.

593
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,584
Perfect. Thank you, sweetness.

594
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,102
I will take care of that for
you, and I'll see you next week.

595
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,224
Now, you.

596
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,984
You are here about Hermes?

597
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,949
His son, actually. It's
kind of important.

598
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,864
Yeah, I could tell the way you
burst in here, all rude-like.

599
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,465
His son's name is
Luke Castellan.

600
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,627
What has that wayward boy of
mine gotten himself into now?

601
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,027
Wait, you're... Hermes.

602
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,427
Little insulted you
didn't recognize me.

603
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,822
My feelings might have even been hurt if I
wasn't such a self-confident individual.

604
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,982
I don't know if you noticed,
but I'm killing these shorts.

605
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,141
Sir, we're looking for Luke...

606
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,382
because he attacked Camp Half-Blood
and kidnapped our friend.

607
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,225
And we really need your help, and
we don't have a lot of time.

608
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,509
That's really cute, how you
finish each other's sentences.

609
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,861
Follow.

610
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,789
You like this tie? I just bought it.
Hermés, of course.

611
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,341
Check it out.

612
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,031
State-of-the-art sorting,
processing and packaging facility.

613
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,865
If you can box it, we can
ship it at the speed of...

614
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,544
Well, me.

615
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,190
We have plans to
expand next year.

616
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,785
We're finding we have
some space issues.

617
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,669
So picture this, only bigger.

618
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,866
Don't touch that.

619
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,022
We're the fastest-growing
Olympian industry.

620
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,346
It took awhile to
get up and running,

621
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,740
but Rome wasn't
built in a day.

622
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,151
Trust me, I was there.

623
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,541
Excuse me, sir, we're
in a bit of a hurry.

624
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,384
Relax, my friend.
Take it slow.

625
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,747
Oh, come on!
Give me a break!

626
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,625
Easy for you
to say, Your Eminence.

627
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,663
Actually, Martha, it's
not easy for him.

628
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,663
He's the God of
freaking speed.

629
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:18,348
Except he's not the one whose butt is
stuck to a big silver stick forever!

630
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:21,020
<i>Hey. Guys, what did I say?</i>

631
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,380
When we meet new people,
protract your S's.

632
00:42:23,381 --> 00:42:24,368
It's more dramatic.

633
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,905
Makes an impression.

634
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,103
Ugh! I'm personally insulted.
Snakes don't talk like that.

635
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,467
It is a stereotype
and it's offensive.

636
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,907
Mmm-hmm! Bad enough some of our relatives
are hanging out with Medusa...

637
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,186
turning people to stone.

638
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,261
All right.

639
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,547
Ooh! I love your hair. I
wish my hair would do that.

640
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,826
Yeah, that will happen.

641
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,346
Why don't you guys make
yourselves useful?

642
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,707
Demi-Google Luke for me. These
kids are looking for him.

643
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,544
Why? Do they have
a death wish?

644
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,384
It doesn't matter. Just...

645
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,586
Didn't even say "please."

646
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,981
Told you! We should have
taken that job with Hercules.

647
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,869
They're an acquired taste.

648
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,229
Luke. I don't know
what to do about him.

649
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,647
I've tried reaching out,
but the kid's angry.

650
00:42:58,648 --> 00:42:59,499
He's resentful.

651
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,299
And he holds a grudge
like nobody's business.

652
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,825
Just like his mother,
come to think of it.

653
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,789
Yeah, he's not my
biggest fan either.

654
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:08,751
If you're gonna cross paths or,
Zeus forbid, swords with him...

655
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,825
it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world
to have a thing or two to help you out.

656
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,948
Collector's item,
mint condition.

657
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,546
<i>From Hercules Busts
Heads, Season One.</i>

658
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,225
<i>Hercules Busts Heads?</i>

659
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,745
Best TV show ever.

660
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,830
So, of course, cancelled.

661
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,343
Got this off Deity-Bay.

662
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,583
You twist the cap off this, you release the
winds from the four corners of the Earth.

663
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,867
Now, you tell me
that isn't cool.

664
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,590
Whoa! No, not in here!

665
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,341
Not in here.

666
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,867
By the gods, George was right.
You do have a death wish.

667
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,145
Now, you're also...

668
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,787
You're also gonna
want one of these.

669
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,989
Um, thanks.

670
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,983
Mythical box sealer?

671
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,905
You wound me.
Truly, lam wounded.

672
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:00,348
I hold in my hands a Matter Eliminator.
Trademark pending.

673
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,184
Anything you outline
with this...

674
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,421
Not in here.

675
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,231
...will disappear.

676
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,268
Whoosh! Gone. Instant hole.

677
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,626
"Demi-Google Luke," he said.

678
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,782
Except, how am I supposed
to type without fingers?

679
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,425
You were supposed
to use the mouse!

680
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,945
I'm a snake. I eat mice.

681
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,863
All right, thank you.
Have you found Luke?

682
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,146
Did he just say "thank you"?

683
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,824
I'm sure it was just a lapse.

684
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,504
Luke's on a yacht
called the Andromeda.

685
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:23,021
It's passing by Chesapeake
Beach as we speak.

686
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,101
Thank you.

687
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,944
You're sssso welcome.

688
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,385
There, you happy?

689
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,990
Hush.

690
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,625
Thank you very much.

691
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,381
Hey, listen... Um...

692
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,630
If you see Luke...

693
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:41,023
please explain
to him for me...

694
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,388
that parents, we make
mistakes sometimes.

695
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,630
He has every right
to be angry at me.

696
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,101
Just, please tell him not
to be angry with the world.

697
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:55,425
I'm not sure if there's anything
that I can say that will change him.

698
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:56,866
Try.

699
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,428
If it's one thing I've
learned in 3000 years...

700
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,901
it's you can't
give up on family.

701
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,710
Thanks again.

702
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,110
He'll never make it.

703
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,106
That's lunch!

704
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,501
That's it.
That's Luke's yacht.

705
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,264
What do we do? Swim?

706
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,945
But it's water.

707
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,590
Dad will help.

708
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:38,581
Hey, Dad.

709
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,943
We're trying to save Camp Half-Blood
and rescue a satyr named Grover.

710
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:45,581
And we could really use your help
getting to that ship out there.

711
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,300
Poseidon?

712
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:49,981
Dad?

713
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:51,671
It was a nice try, big guy...

714
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:54,584
but don't be upset
when he doesn't...

715
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,710
...answer.

716
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,269
It's a hippocampus.

717
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,786
Hi, girl.

718
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,861
Boy.

719
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,386
Come here.

720
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:39,465
Sometimes, you just gotta ask.

721
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,540
All I've been doing is asking.

722
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,300
Are you coming?

723
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,301
Yeah.

724
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,266
Are you ready?

725
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,626
Yeah.

726
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,020
Giddy up!

727
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,541
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

728
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:16,821
Back up!

729
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:18,581
Back up.

730
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,744
Thank you, friend.

731
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,060
Tyson.

732
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,985
Come on, buddy. We gotta go.

733
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,221
Oh.

734
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,510
You want some sugar?

735
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,945
Have you seen it? No, man.

736
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:52,987
Did he show it to you?

737
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,340
Wait until you see it.

738
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,582
It took him
long enough to find it.

739
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,984
That's Chris Rodriguez, Ethan
Nakamura, and Silena Beauregard.

740
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:03,664
Luke's been recruiting.

741
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,504
Shh!

742
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,423
This is a nice boat.

743
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,503
How are we gonna find Grover?

744
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,423
Luke is probably keeping
him below deck somewhere.

745
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,985
Like, in a brig.

746
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,421
I don't think yachts
have brigs, Percy.

747
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,430
Follow me.

748
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,950
Be careful, you guys.
He said keep your distance.

749
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,111
How much longer are we
gonna be on this boat, anyway?

750
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,143
Doesn't matter,
just watch it.

751
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:46,828
It's so time to go.

752
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:49,302
Hey, Percy. Percy!

753
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:50,861
Huh?

754
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,584
Tyson, do you
have to make so much noise?

755
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,991
Sorry!

756
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:14,541
Chris?

757
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,781
Hey.

758
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,108
What have you
done with Grover?

759
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:22,665
Grover? Grover's the
least of your worries.

760
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,626
<i> Guess who's here.</i>

761
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:38,427
What a surprise. If it isn't
my two favorite cousins.

762
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,826
Three.

763
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,550
I'm a son of Poseidon, too.

764
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:46,226
That's funny, because Poseidon doesn't
have any other half-blood sons.

765
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,109
I'm a Cyclops.

766
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:51,781
Mist.

767
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,624
You don't say.

768
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,349
It's been a long time.

769
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,863
You look good.

770
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,711
Where's Grover?

771
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,709
Grover, Grover.

772
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,141
Oh, Grover, yes.
Right, the satyr.

773
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,826
He should be in the Sea of
Monsters right about now.

774
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,507
I sent him on ahead with some friends.
We're kind of on the clock.

775
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,551
Wait, you're not...

776
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:21,950
You're not just trying to stop
us from getting the Fleece.

777
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,510
I need it, too.

778
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,864
I got something only
the Fleece can revive.

779
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,909
And it's not a tree.

780
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,385
Wanna see it?

781
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:43,503
It wasn't easy to find. I had to crawl
through the depths of Tartarus itself.

782
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,428
And then Cleveland.

783
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:49,547
The remains of Kronos.

784
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,783
The original Titan,
father to the Olympians.

785
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:56,501
And with the Fleece's help,
destroyer of Olympus.

786
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,190
And the world.

787
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:02,546
You'd destroy the whole world
just to get back at your Dad?

788
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,626
The Olympians overthrew
their parents.

789
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,750
It's just our turn.

790
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:09,306
We met your father.

791
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,750
He said that he knows
that he made mistakes.

792
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,585
He told us to tell you
to not be so angry.

793
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:16,941
Really?

794
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,147
And he couldn't even
tell me himself.

795
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,509
Does that sound familiar?

796
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,670
Take them to the brig.

797
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:28,071
Let's go. Come on.

798
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,303
Thalia was your friend! She
sacrificed herself for you.

799
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:36,424
You're gonna lecture me about Thalia
when you're hanging around with him?

800
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,301
You disappoint me the most.

801
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:18,183
I told you he had a brig.

802
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,065
How can you trust him?

803
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,790
He was probably making all
that noise on purpose.

804
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:28,703
He wanted Luke to catch us.

805
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,101
What do you have
against Tyson anyway?

806
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:32,864
He's a Cyclops.

807
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:35,910
I think the politically correct
term is "ocularly impaired."

808
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:38,790
Who cares? They're vicious
and they're dangerous.

809
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,987
Yeah, vicious.

810
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,982
We have to get out of here.

811
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,585
How?

812
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,582
Just hang on to something.

813
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,384
All right, here we go.

814
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,064
Come on, come on, come on!

815
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,141
Um... What's going on?

816
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:15,669
Percy's trying to kill us.

817
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,021
I think it's working.

818
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,581
You got it?

819
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,788
Piece of cake.

820
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,988
I think I'm gonna vomit.

821
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:38,581
Yep.

822
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:42,182
So, how does this work?

823
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:46,021
I don't know. It's my
first mythical tape gun.

824
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:07,308
Just like Hermes said...

825
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,141
"instant hole."

826
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,950
Go to the lifeboat.

827
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:52,904
Kill the engines.

828
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:00,428
That was for Grover.

829
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,425
Grab him!

830
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,431
We got him!

831
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:47,470
What are you doing?

832
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,624
Don't walk on my roof.

833
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,144
Join me, Percy.

834
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,790
It's what you
were meant to do.

835
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,989
You can't escape
that prophecy.

836
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:03,624
Let's show both
of our fathers.

837
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:05,905
It's tempting.

838
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,021
Oh...

839
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,860
That's genius. Really.

840
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,144
But I think I'll pass.

841
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:33,510
Not this again.

842
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:36,821
Go!

843
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,220
Are you staying?

844
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:39,341
I'll be right behind you.

845
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:45,105
May as well.

846
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:21,225
Jackson, enough.

847
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:28,067
You're on the losing side.

848
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,429
Not from where I stand.

849
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:40,181
Oh!

850
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,985
Smart.

851
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:52,905
Goddess of wisdom's
daughter, remember?

852
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:55,424
I remember.

853
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:07,505
Our allies and the satyr still
have a head start on the Fleece.

854
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,501
We will resurrect
you, Lord Kronos.

855
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:14,308
You will know vengeance.

856
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:19,107
And the Olympians who
scorned us will know death.

857
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:40,621
Maybe you should reapply.

858
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,345
It wore off?

859
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:46,861
Yeah.

860
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:01,346
Come on.

861
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:04,471
Oh, no.

862
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,187
Hey.

863
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:14,148
Do you want to
steer for a while?

864
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:17,671
Thank you.

865
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,626
Nobody's ever trusted me
with anything before.

866
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:24,704
Is that because of your
lack of depth perception?

867
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,307
Is it because they're
scared of you?

868
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,388
I was in the
mountains one day...

869
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:40,140
and some campers, Boy
Scouts, showed up.

870
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:46,546
And when they saw
me, they screamed.

871
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:49,585
They ran.

872
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,627
And I'm pretty sure I smiled.

873
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:59,304
People look at me, and
they see a monster.

874
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:02,381
Sometimes, I think
maybe they're right.

875
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:08,626
You're not a monster. Don't
be so hard on yourself.

876
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,550
Easy for you to say.

877
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,065
What do you mean?

878
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:17,508
You never doubt yourself or
think you're less than you are.

879
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:23,588
Thank you, brother.

880
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:26,865
Come here. Open it slowly.

881
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,226
Slowly.

882
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:34,065
Hey, just take it slow.
Slow, okay?

883
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:43,224
I wouldn't have trusted him
with a normal thermos.

884
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,588
He seems okay.

885
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:48,584
I really don't get what
your problem with him is.

886
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,268
Because you don't know
what I know about them.

887
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:55,586
Thalia!

888
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:05,467
A Cyclops killed her.

889
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:09,101
His kind killed Thalia.

890
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,110
I'm sorry.

891
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,030
I never knew.

892
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:17,786
Well, it's not something
I like talking about.

893
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,551
And anyway, it was
a long time ago.

894
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:32,705
What is that?

895
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,624
It's the Sea of Monsters.

896
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:43,630
Why are we stopping?

897
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:49,149
I should have used two hands.

898
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:50,631
You think?

899
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:52,826
Are you mad at me?

900
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:54,948
No, not at you.

901
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,630
Tell me those aren't sharks.

902
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,784
Those aren't sharks.

903
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:21,867
Paddle! Paddle!

904
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:28,863
Yeah, sharks would be better.

905
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,189
It's Charybdis.

906
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:46,666
Charyb-... What?

907
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:48,742
She guards the
Sea of Monsters.

908
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:55,781
Percy!

909
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:04,824
It's not working!

910
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,783
The Sea of Monsters might not
be in Poseidon's domain.

911
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,301
Hold on!

912
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:54,110
Where are we?

913
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:57,905
Smells like the stomach.

914
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,423
Watch your step.

915
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,224
What is this stuff?

916
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:20,351
I don't think you
want to know.

917
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:21,421
Whoa!

918
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:24,386
This has to be the worst
way to die, ever.

919
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:28,306
Yeah, everything that disappears
in the Bermuda Triangle...

920
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:30,588
this is where they end up.

921
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:32,945
Oh, come on!

922
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,345
That sounded like Clarisse.

923
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,229
No, it couldn't be her.

924
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:40,190
You ridiculously
stupid morons.

925
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:42,263
No, it's her. It's her.

926
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:47,821
You idiot!

927
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:51,188
Better keep my electric grid up and
running, or I'll plug your head into it!

928
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,223
Clarisse! Hey!

929
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:59,109
Jackson? What are
you doing here?

930
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:01,388
We got swallowed
up, just like you.

931
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:02,621
Nice ship.

932
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,829
My Dad's got tons of this stuff left
over from wars throughout history.

933
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:07,669
It was either this or
a Huey from Vietnam.

934
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:09,947
I figured a boat would
be more practical.

935
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:14,266
What's going on?

936
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:17,867
Pretty much exactly what you think
goes on inside of a stomach.

937
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,431
You're right.

938
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:34,503
That really is the
worst way to die.

939
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:35,627
Reardon!

940
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:38,180
What in Hades is going on with my engine?
Is it ready yet?

941
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:41,184
Almost, ma'am. They're
working on it.

942
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:43,991
Wait, your crew is zombies?

943
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:50,226
They prefer "dead Confederate sailors whose
lives have been given in tribute to Ares."

944
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,780
But "zombies" is fine.

945
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:10,151
Reardon! Gun! Faster! Now!

946
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:12,308
Gun is hot, Cap'n.
Locked and loaded.

947
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:14,382
Aim it at that 
meat grinder.

948
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:16,781
Wait, wait. You want to
shoot that thing with this?

949
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:20,023
Do you have a better idea?
Because now would be the time.

950
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:24,786
Hey, Clarisse.

951
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:26,587
What?

952
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:28,026
Can you steer the ship?

953
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,465
No. I just finished
driver's ed.

954
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:30,945
Yes, of course, I
can steer a ship.

955
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:32,431
Well...

956
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,390
why don't we give
her a stomach ache?

957
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:36,383
We'll escape through the gut.

958
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:38,908
It just might work if it
doesn't kill us first.

959
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:41,301
You steer, I'll shoot.

960
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:44,064
All hands below deck!

961
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:48,184
Good luck, Percy.

962
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:57,622
All hands below deck. This is not a drill!
Come on, boys. Get in there.

963
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:03,550
This is still my quest.

964
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:05,828
Do not screw this
up for me, Jackson.

965
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:20,861
Ah!

966
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,543
You should watch what you eat.

967
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,501
Go!

968
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:46,310
No kidding, genius.

969
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:00,263
I hope this works.

970
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:03,621
Just don't forget.

971
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:04,866
Forget what?

972
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:09,388
This is all your idea.

973
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:23,381
Whoa!

974
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:25,791
Come on, come on.

975
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:40,781
We did it! I did it!

976
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:44,462
Listen up. Full
power to the screws.

977
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:45,991
Hey, are you guys all right?

978
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:47,425
That was amazing.

979
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:53,110
You have to have faith, right?

980
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:55,706
And a Cannon. We'll
find Grover.

981
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:58,991
Where is Ichneutae?

982
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:00,664
Oh, now you miss Ichneutae?

983
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:03,823
We ran into Scylla, that
multi-headed Hydra thing.

984
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:05,630
He said, "I got this."

985
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:07,270
Famous last words.

986
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:09,502
We've restored
full power, Cap'n.

987
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:11,589
-Heading?
-Northwest.

988
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:21,104
Are you sure about that?

989
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:24,502
Yes, I'm sure about that.
Why, do you have a problem?

990
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:25,581
Yeah, you got a problem?

991
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:33,503
I think your Confederate warship is
heading to West Palm Beach, Florida.

992
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:35,621
What is it?

993
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:39,341
I know this sounds insane, but
it's kind of like my dyslexia.

994
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:43,710
But instead of being able to
read Greek, I can see map lines.

995
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:47,627
30, 31, 75, 12.

996
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:50,741
Wait, that's the
numbers from the...

997
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:54,586
From the crazy,
eyeless taxi drivers.

998
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:55,821
They're coordinates.

999
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,109
Ha! Waterboy figured it out.

1000
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,341
And he called you crazy.

1001
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:00,620
Actually, he called you crazy.

1002
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:02,503
Hey, eye on the road.

1003
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,142
30, 31 degrees north...

1004
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:07,828
75, 12 degrees west.

1005
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:10,426
That's where Polyphemus
and the Fleece are.

1006
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,901
Change course. Southwest.

1007
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:14,425
Aye. Aye.

1008
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:16,020
Sorry.

1009
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,345
Land ho!

1010
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:46,785
Polyphemus lives in
an amusement park?

1011
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:48,749
No, he lives on an island.

1012
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,931
But the goddess Circe
thought building an

1013
01:12:50,944 --> 01:12:52,985
amusement park on top
of it was a good idea.

1014
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:54,300
It really wasn't.

1015
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:55,711
What happened?

1016
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:57,506
Opening day...

1017
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:01,790
long lines of savory half-bloods
and one hungry Cyclops.

1018
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:03,991
Bad for business.

1019
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,543
I'll just turn us
right around then.

1020
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:08,543
Find us a place to dock.

1021
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:11,987
I was afraid she was
gonna say that.

1022
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:33,744
I guess the Cyclops
was bad for business.

1023
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:35,140
Who knew?

1024
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:40,144
We don't have time to
search this whole place.

1025
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,184
I don't think we have to.

1026
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:48,821
"Plummet of Death"?

1027
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:51,070
That's subtle.

1028
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:54,909
It looks like something really
big went through there.

1029
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:59,183
I don't know. It doesn't
really scream "Cyclops" to me.

1030
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:05,269
At least there's no line.

1031
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:12,750
Sweet ride.

1032
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:17,191
Might need a push.

1033
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,630
Here we go.

1034
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:30,271
Tyson? Let go of my hand.
Tyson: Sorry.

1035
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:37,386
<i> It's a
small world after all.</i>

1036
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,799
<i>It's a small world after all.</i>

1037
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,047
<i> It's
a small world after all.</i>

1038
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:43,547
Could you two just shut up?

1039
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:48,621
Hold on!

1040
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:52,471
Is everybody okay?

1041
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:54,668
I thought that
would be more fun.

1042
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:02,945
I think I get what
Grover was so worried about.

1043
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:06,979
This must be the Boulder Polyphemus
used to trap Odysseus...

1044
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:09,551
when he was returning
from the Trojan War.

1045
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:12,341
Yeah, that's right.
I know stuff.

1046
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:29,500
Grover!

1047
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,304
Enough!

1048
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:37,108
I can't take this anymore!

1049
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:46,825
It's been two days!

1050
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:49,267
Calm your temper!
Calm your temper!

1051
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:53,741
I haven't had a decent meal since
those half-bloods you brought!

1052
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:56,665
And this stupid fleece is
supposed to lure satyrs!

1053
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:58,504
Do you see any
satyrs around here?

1054
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:03,230
This hunger is making
my eyesight worse.

1055
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:05,144
I could just eat you.

1056
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:10,225
If you weren't a Cyclops.

1057
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:12,981
Grover!

1058
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:15,741
Grover!

1059
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:17,301
Hey! Come here!

1060
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:18,666
Percy?

1061
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:21,941
Hey!

1062
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:25,584
Why are you wearing a dress?

1063
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:27,947
I'm having a really bad day!

1064
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:30,501
Hey, hey, hey! Do not
let that go viral!

1065
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:33,061
Sorry, there's no way the other
kids would believe me otherwise.

1066
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:34,585
This is a disguise.

1067
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:37,266
The guy's half-blind. He thinks
I'm a Cyclops chambermaid.

1068
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:38,865
I'm showing mad
survival skills, here.

1069
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:40,385
And not a small amount of leg.

1070
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:41,461
Funny.

1071
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:43,269
I was trying to stay
uneaten long enough to

1072
01:16:43,282 --> 01:16:45,022
figure out how to get
the Fleece off of him.

1073
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,511
So, did you?

1074
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:49,587
Do you think I'd still be
dressed like this if I did?

1075
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:51,344
It's a good look.

1076
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:52,547
Thanks, Tyson.

1077
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:59,784
Clopsies, how about I cook
you something to drink...

1078
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:01,829
to calm your nerves?

1079
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:05,942
I don't know
what to do anymore.

1080
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:08,111
Go! Go!

1081
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:11,025
This fleece used to
lure satyrs every day.

1082
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:12,101
Huh?

1083
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:17,626
Now things are so bad, I even
had to eat my own sheep.

1084
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:19,825
The whole flock!

1085
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:22,744
They were tender, though.

1086
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:27,303
Drop me, and I promise you'll
never hear the end of it.

1087
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:34,544
Do you smell something?
Smells like half-bloods!

1088
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:40,741
Half-bloods!

1089
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:42,629
Get up, quick!
I was right!

1090
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,225
You stay right there!

1091
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:45,984
Woman, get a fire going!

1092
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:47,426
That's not good!

1093
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:48,985
On second thought...

1094
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,623
I'll just eat you raw!

1095
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:52,701
Hey!

1096
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,101
Huh.

1097
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:56,585
Hiya!

1098
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:58,265
My name's Tyson. How are you?

1099
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:00,823
These guys are my friends...

1100
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:02,903
so I was hoping,
maybe, we could talk.

1101
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:05,426
You know, Cyclops to Cyclops.

1102
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,503
You pissant with one eye!

1103
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:09,230
Hey! Not nice!

1104
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:13,669
You're no Cyclops!
You're a traitor to your kind!

1105
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:14,867
To be honest...

1106
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:17,501
Huh? What?

1107
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:19,506
He's my kind.

1108
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:21,708
You disgust me.

1109
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:28,425
Going somewhere?

1110
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:35,591
I think you've got
something of mine.

1111
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:37,746
Annabeth!

1112
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:42,381
Oh!

1113
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:44,386
Clarisse!

1114
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:57,949
Get back here, you punk!

1115
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,545
Yo, Clopsies!

1116
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:03,309
I quit!

1117
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:06,467
Wait, you're a dude?

1118
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:08,185
Well, that explains a lot.

1119
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:11,220
Say goodbye. Okay. Goodbye!

1120
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:14,623
You deceitful little brats!
I'll tear off your flesh!

1121
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:17,222
Come on! Go, go!

1122
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,425
Give me that fleece!

1123
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:30,106
You're dead!

1124
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:31,750
I'm gonna kill all of you!

1125
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:34,103
Do you hear me?

1126
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,184
Get back here!

1127
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:46,865
We rocked that quest.

1128
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:48,624
Yeah, we totally did.

1129
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:51,067
I didn't know you
guys had it in you!

1130
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:52,421
Yes.

1131
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:54,146
Well done.

1132
01:19:57,940 --> 01:20:00,102
It's nice work. I
really appreciate it.

1133
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:03,107
I'll take that.

1134
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:08,420
I don't think so.

1135
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,141
Suit yourself.

1136
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:30,309
You'd do it for me.

1137
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:33,100
No!

1138
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:59,222
Just remember...

1139
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:01,428
it didn't have
to end this way.

1140
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:04,629
This one's on you.

1141
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:12,784
Down, boy!

1142
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:22,021
You should consider
yourselves lucky.

1143
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:24,941
This has been millennia
in the making.

1144
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:27,549
And you all get to see it.

1145
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,188
You used to be one of us!

1146
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:33,624
And then I woke up.

1147
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:41,981
Percy, if Kronos comes back, that's it.
Game over.

1148
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,386
Percy.

1149
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:48,863
I never called him "brother."

1150
01:21:50,860 --> 01:21:53,261
All he ever wanted
was a brother...

1151
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:57,186
but I was too wrapped
up in myself.

1152
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:01,745
And now Luke has the Fleece...

1153
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:04,062
because I gave it to him.

1154
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:09,984
I destroy Olympus, just
like the Oracle said.

1155
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:13,425
Forget the Oracle.

1156
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:18,183
You're worried about your destiny?
Then write a new one.

1157
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:21,029
You're angry at Poseidon
for ignoring you?

1158
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:23,023
Then show him why
he shouldn't.

1159
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:25,742
You're upset about Tyson?

1160
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:29,342
Then make sure he
didn't die for nothing.

1161
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:31,149
She's right.

1162
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:34,821
What?

1163
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:37,745
There's no way you're
getting me to repeat that.

1164
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,268
What Annabeth is
saying, Perce...

1165
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:43,661
is that we're with you.

1166
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:45,584
Just give the word.

1167
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:47,385
Why me?

1168
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,783
I mean, who voted me leader?

1169
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:07,471
Lord Kronos, he who was
betrayed by his sons...

1170
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:10,544
hear now the words of one
betrayed by his father.

1171
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:13,351
I bid you... rise.

1172
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:52,821
Grover!

1173
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:55,861
Hands.

1174
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:59,588
Try not to cut them off. I'm
pretty attached to them.

1175
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:20,863
I have to get to the Fleece.

1176
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:23,062
So, what are we
supposed to do?

1177
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:26,385
Right.

1178
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:57,511
I know you can breathe
underwater, Jackson.

1179
01:24:57,580 --> 01:24:59,423
But can you breathe like this?

1180
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:10,741
Hi, Brother!

1181
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:25,787
What the...?

1182
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:27,066
The water.

1183
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:30,025
It healed me.

1184
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:33,989
Son of Poseidon.

1185
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:40,191
Thank you...

1186
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:43,265
Brother.

1187
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:08,585
He rises.

1188
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:27,191
Master!

1189
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:29,024
I brought you back!

1190
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:39,909
My Lord!

1191
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:41,186
It's Luke!

1192
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:46,069
Luke Castellan! Your
great-grandson!

1193
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:48,910
My favorite.

1194
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:33,261
Whoa!

1195
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:36,901
Grover!

1196
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:14,223
It's the cursed blade!

1197
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:17,789
"...cursed blade shall reap."

1198
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:47,460
You want to know who
gave me this sword?

1199
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:51,583
The God that killed you
with it in the first place!

1200
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:56,151
My father.

1201
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:58,904
Percy Jackson...

1202
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:01,711
your destiny was
written long ago.

1203
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:05,146
No!

1204
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:10,502
I make my own destiny.

1205
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:48,103
Half-blood!

1206
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:51,621
Just in time for dinner.

1207
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:17,620
Thanks, Dad.

1208
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:21,585
Percy.

1209
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:30,665
Annabeth!

1210
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:35,021
Grover!

1211
01:30:58,540 --> 01:30:59,701
Annabeth!

1212
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:03,786
No, no!

1213
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:06,785
At least I'll be with
Thalia in Elysium.

1214
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:09,103
Come here. Give me the Fleece!

1215
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:10,745
Come on! Come on.

1216
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:11,861
Come on.

1217
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:17,945
We make our own destinies, right?
So show me.

1218
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:19,301
I have faith in you.

1219
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:26,070
No, no. Come on, show me.

1220
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:28,220
Show me.

1221
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:31,191
Come on.

1222
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:07,946
Annie.

1223
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:14,785
What happened?

1224
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:16,661
Don't worry about it.

1225
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:19,186
If anyone else wants
to die tonight...

1226
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:21,388
at least we have this.

1227
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:25,387
Hey. You're alive.

1228
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:27,710
Yeah.

1229
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:30,741
What you did for Percy...

1230
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:34,587
that was not so vicious
and dangerous.

1231
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:38,385
Thanks.

1232
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:40,141
No.

1233
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:42,071
Thank you.

1234
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:54,261
You know what, Tyson?

1235
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:57,025
I know a lot of campers with two
eyes who couldn't do what you did.

1236
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:59,182
Hey, Clarisse. What?

1237
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:01,786
Come on, big guy. We get back
to camp, the nectar's on me.

1238
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:03,589
Have you met the nymphs?

1239
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:05,745
This was your quest.

1240
01:33:06,780 --> 01:33:10,421
I couldn't have done
it without you.

1241
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:12,821
I think you should be
the one who gets to...

1242
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:14,584
CHIRON: ...do the honors.

1243
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:33,068
Here you go, Thalia.

1244
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:49,507
Clarisse! Clarisse! Clarisse!

1245
01:34:55,140 --> 01:34:56,426
Nectar?

1246
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:00,661
If you haven't had... .
..you haven't lived.

1247
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:07,506
You know what?

1248
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:10,942
You don't need these anymore.

1249
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:14,065
There, that's better.

1250
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:29,866
<i> You seem happy.</i>

1251
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:34,146
I'm just relieved to have that whole
prophecy thing off my shoulders.

1252
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:36,951
I'm not altogether
sure it is, Percy.

1253
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:41,230
You've done wonderfully, but you are
still the only living human child...

1254
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:43,701
of Poseidon, Hades, or Zeus.

1255
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:45,271
Besides...

1256
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:47,974
it's quite possible the
Oracle wasn't referring

1257
01:35:47,987 --> 01:35:50,551
to what would unfold
on Polyphemus' island.

1258
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:53,624
I'm just saying, a lot can happen
between now and your 20th birthday.

1259
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:55,702
That's not really
what I meant.

1260
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:59,466
What I meant was finding
out you have a destiny...

1261
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:03,261
is a lot like finding out you have
a half-brother who's a Cyclops.

1262
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:05,867
It might not be as
bad as you think.

1263
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:21,425
Percy! Percy!

1264
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:23,865
Percy!

1265
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:26,990
Annabeth was guarding
the tree last night...

1266
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:28,790
and something happened.

1267
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:32,021
Percy.

1268
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:34,270
The Fleece! What happened?

1269
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:36,946
It was even more powerful
than we thought.

1270
01:36:56,620 --> 01:36:58,065
Come on, help her.

1271
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:01,060
Who are you?

1272
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:04,387
Percy. Everything's
all right, it's okay.

1273
01:37:04,820 --> 01:37:06,231
I had the strangest dream.

1274
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:07,301
Yeah?

1275
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:09,303
Like I was dying.

1276
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:11,025
What's your name?

1277
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:15,303
I'm Thalia, daughter of Zeus.

1278
01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:20,984
<i> Another living
child of the eldest gods.</i>

1279
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:26,061
<i>Maybe it wasn't me.</i>

1280
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:29,070
<i>Maybe the Oracle meant
Thalia all along.</i>

1281
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:32,867
<i>Could she be our salvation?</i>

1282
01:37:33,260 --> 01:37:35,661
<i>Or the 'cause of
our destruction?</i>
