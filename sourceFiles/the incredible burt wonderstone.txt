It's an octuple king. Biggest bed in Vegas.
Easily sleeps two dozen adults.

174
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,398
If the phone rings and I'm on the other
side of the bed, I can't get to it.

Ahh! God, that was close.

The point is, it's a huge bed.

And I was wondering,
would you like to see it tonight...

179
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,082
...nakedly?

180
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,622
Oh, I don't think that's a good idea...

- Listen, Nicole.

I know this is your first show
and it's all very new and fresh and exciting...

00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,425
...but when you have done this 5000 times...

186
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,436
...you'll find that having sex with me
is the only way...

187

...to mitigate the miserable drudgery
of your existence.

00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:14,271
- My point is this. Let's just have sex.
- It's not gonna happen.

- You a lesbian?
- Is every woman who doesn't sleep with you...

- What the hell is a webisode?

Are you being serious? What's a webis...?
It's a show that you do on the Internet.

except you don't go through...

of people seeing it.

has been getting a little bitey lately.

not a big cat magician.

- All right. Very good.

Judah, what is your favorite animal?
A mole, a sloth, a puppy?

1182
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:02,299
- A puppy.
- A puppy. A puppy.

1183
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:05,135
Let's make a puppy for Judah's birthday,
shall we?

1184

There you go, a puppy. Hmm.

1185
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:17,359
It's not really that cute, is it?

1186
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:20,613
Sort of a lame puppy. I think I can do better.
I'll start again.

Happy birthday, Judah.

Wow, thanks.
I'm going to call him Wonderstone.

1191
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:33,041
Can I see Wonderstone for a second?

1192

Hey, everybody. Watch this, everyone.

1193
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:40,841
What an adorable little life form.

1194
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,345
You know,
I bet I can make him even smaller.

1195

- I like to squeeze him really hard!
- Stop it.

1197
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,515
Give me the dog. Give me that dog!

1198
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:52,849
Give him to me.

1202

go eventually.

Okay. Bye.

1345
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:26,630
Happy for you.

1346
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:31,010
JANE: 
All right.

1347
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:42,665
- Oh.
- I believe that this is yours?

1348
01:23:44,478 --> 01:23:47,448
Very good. Mm.

1349
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:51,451
Oh. You have, um, something in your ear.

1350
01:23:52,945 --> 01:23:54,117
- Very nice.
JANE: Thank you.

1351
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:56,623
Unfortunately,
I don't think that will work for me.

1352
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:57,829
JANE: 
Aah.

1353
01:23:57,991 --> 01:24:00,289
- Really?
- No, it's just for the trick.

1354
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:02,329
Oh, okay.

1355
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:27,445

1357

Hup.

1358
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:40,035
Okay! Okay! Yeah, that was something!

1359
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,497
Okay, get off.

1360
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:44,163
Go ahead. Yeah. Ahem.

1361
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:46,169
Sorry about that. Heh.

Next up, a man who lives
on the cutting edge...

1364
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:52,137
...and the burning edge...

1365
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:54,219
...and the gouging edge of magic.

1366
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:58,181
You may know him from his TV show,
<i>Brain Rapist.</i>

1367
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:00,516
So prepare to have your brains raped.

1370
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:25,124
Thank you.

1371
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:27,710
But I'm not here for applause.

1372
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:30,672
I'm different than the other magicians
you'll see tonight.

1373
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:33,553
In fact, I'm not planning
on doing any magic...

1374
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:34,884
...at all.

1375
01:25:35,047 --> 01:25:37,391
Instead,
I want to do a little thing I call:

1376
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:41,887
Drilling a hole in my head.

1377
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:43,271
(AUDIENCE GASPS)

1378
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:46,566
STEVE: Now, according to my research,
there's a narrow angle...

1379
01:25:48,435 --> 01:25:50,403
...where one can drill...

1380
01:25:54,858 --> 01:25:56,235
...into the skull...

1381
01:25:57,736 --> 01:25:59,909
...missing all the vital parts of the brain.

1382
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:03,372
Now, I've been informed
by my medical team...

1383
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:06,670
...that I may lose one of my senses...

1384
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:08,751
...leaving me with only five.

1385
01:26:09,373 --> 01:26:11,250
And no longer special in any way.

1386
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:14,378
Yes, just like one of you.

1387
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:16,804
So...

...cross your fingers for me.

Oh, and, parents,
if you have small children with you...

1390
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:27,103
...you might want to lift them up
so they can see better.

1391
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:30,394
All right, without further delay...

1392
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:36,108

...Burt Wonderstone and Anton
Marvelton, ladies and gentlemen!

Yes! Ha, ha!

1412
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:53,394
ANTON: 
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1413
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:58,361
Good evening. For 15 years,
Anton and I did a little show called:

1414
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:01,527
"Burt & Anton: A Magical Friendship."

1415
01:28:01,985 --> 01:28:05,535
But as some of you may know,
we recently had a falling-out.

1416
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:08,075
Yeah, we fell right out of The Hot Box.

1417
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:09,584
(ALL LAUGH)

1418
01:28:09,743 --> 01:28:11,871
BURT: Oh. See, ladies and gentlemen,
along the way...

1419
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:17,089
...we forgot the most important thing of all,
and that is that Burt needs Anton.

1420
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:19,548
And Anton needs Burt.

1421
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:22,840
Because that is what a magical friendship
is all about.

1422
01:28:23,632 --> 01:28:28,229
Tonight, we offer you the one illusion
that we dreamed about as kids...

1423
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:31,014
...but never dared perform until now.

1424
01:28:31,181 --> 01:28:35,357
I guess you could say that this trick
started 30 years ago on my birthday...

1425
01:28:35,519 --> 01:28:38,944
...when I was given
a Rance Holloway Magic Kit.

1426
01:28:40,065 --> 01:28:44,912
And I watched the instructional video
for the very first time.

1427
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:56,415
Hello, my young friends.
I'm Rance Holloway.

1428
01:28:56,915 --> 01:28:59,259
You've probably seen me
on The Merv Griffin Show...

1429
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:00,919
...or live onstage...

1430
01:29:01,086 --> 01:29:05,592
...at the fabulous Stardust Resort and Casino
in Las Vegas.

1431
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:08,931
Magic is the art of making people
believe something...

1432
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:12,519
...they know can't possibly be true.

1433
01:29:12,681 --> 01:29:17,278
For example, if I were to say to the man
in the second row aisle seat:

1434
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:21,941
"That's the ugliest goddamn orange
sweater I have ever seen"...

1435
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:25,452
...you might be astonished,
because there's no way I could've known...

1436
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:29,410
...what he'd be wearing
when I recorded this 30 years ago, right?

1437
01:29:29,573 --> 01:29:31,416
Well, let me tell you something, folks:

No, you ain't seen nothing yet.

Because now Burt and Anton
are going to make all of you...

...everyone in this audience,
man, woman and child...

1444
01:29:53,179 --> 01:29:58,481

We sure did, Albert.

You got the gig. I don't know how you did it.

And I was sure this was gonna be a disaster.

1456
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:14,269
Just one thing. You're gonna make the
audience reappear again at the Doug, right?

Not a problem.

Not bad. But wait till they see
what I have planned.
