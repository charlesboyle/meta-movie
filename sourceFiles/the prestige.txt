177
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,115
He's complacent,
he's predictable, he's boring.

178
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:32,751
Milton has gotten success,
whatever that means,

179
00:13:32,827 --> 00:13:36,058
so now he's scared.
He won't take any risks at all.

180
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,190
He's squandering the goodwill
of his audience with tired,

181
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:41,860

- They're all favorites.

Give me something fresh.
He won't even try a bloody bullet catch.

183
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:47,337
A bullet catch is suicide.

184
00:13:47,408 --> 00:13:51,401
All it takes is some smartass
volunteer to put a button in the barrel.

185
00:13:51,478 --> 00:13:53,742
- Use a plant.
- You can't for every trick.

186
00:13:53,814 --> 00:13:55,782
No seats left for the punters.

187
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,650
All right, no bullet catch, whatever,
but the point is a real magician

188
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,347
tries to invent something new

189
00:14:01,422 --> 00:14:04,289
that other magicians will
scratch their heads over.

190
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:06,553
Then you sell it to him
for a small fortune.

191
00:14:06,627 --> 00:14:09,721
- What?
- I suppose you have such a trick?

192
00:14:09,797 --> 00:14:12,357
- I sure do.
- Would you care to sell it to me?

193
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:14,025
No. No one else can do my trick.

194

- Any trick can be duplicated.
- Wrong.

195

If Mr. Borden has invented
his masterpiece,

196
00:14:20,107 --> 00:14:22,007
he's prepared to do it.

197
00:14:22,076 --> 00:14:24,203
Milton is a showman,
but Borden is right,

198
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:25,905
he won't get his hands dirty.

199
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,541
If you want to see what
it takes to make real magic,

200
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:33,451

there and he really has what it takes.

201
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,750
- Chung Ling Soo.
- I can't afford that.

202
00:14:35,823 --> 00:14:37,552

203
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:41,959
You two go and see that show, and
whichever one of you can tell me

204
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:45,123
how he does the goldfish bowl
trick gets the prize.

205
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,463
- Which is?
- Ten minutes onstage

206
00:14:47,534 --> 00:14:49,365
with my old friend, Mr. Ackerman.

207
00:14:49,436 --> 00:14:50,869
- Really?
- Who's Ackerman?

208
00:14:50,938 --> 00:14:53,998
The top theatrical agent in London.

209
00:14:54,074 --> 00:14:57,066
- I saw you drop the knot again.
- [Woman] I turned my wrists.

210
00:14:57,144 --> 00:14:59,772
Some nights you
just don't get it, do you?

211
00:14:59,847 --> 00:15:02,714
I mean, if that knot slips
and Julia's on the hoist,

212
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:03,875
she'll break her leg.

213
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:05,578
It's the wrong knot.

214
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:08,520
Like I said, the Langford
double will hold tighter.

215
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:12,116
The Langford double isn't
a wet knot. It's too dangerous.

216
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:14,422
If the rope swells, she can't slip it.

217
00:15:14,495 --> 00:15:17,726
- I can slip a Langford underwater.
- We can practice.

218
00:15:17,798 --> 00:15:21,734
- Borden, he said no.
- Oh, you know knots better than me?

219
00:15:21,802 --> 00:15:23,793
Listen, no more mistakes.

220
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:26,567
All right. Yeah? Do you?
You want to take over?

221
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,575
- Just leave.
- I didn't think so.

222
00:15:34,014 --> 00:15:35,845
Hey, Cutter, where's he from?

223
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:39,215
Where are you from? He shifts
props for Virgil at the hall.

224
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:42,449
- Worried he'll steal your tricks?
- Doesn't deal in methods.

225
00:15:42,523 --> 00:15:45,583
- How do you know?
- Because I hired him

226
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:48,890
to find out how Virgil
does the orange trick.

227
00:15:48,963 --> 00:15:51,295
- I don't trust him.
- He's a natural magician.

228
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:53,458
'Course you can't trust him.

229

You will see no trickery,

872
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:21,427
Merely a technique familiar
to certain citizens of the Orient

are not, do not be alarmed.

The manager says he's
never seen a reaction like it.

881
01:01:13,883 --> 01:01:17,182
At least he saw it. I spent
the ovation hiding under the stage.

882
01:01:17,253 --> 01:01:19,585
No one cares about
the man who disappears.

883

They care about the one who comes out.

884

I care about the man in the box.

01:01:23,859 --> 01:01:28,159
Thank you. I don't know,
maybe we could switch before the trick.

I'm the prestige,
and Root's below stage.

01:01:30,466 --> 01:01:33,401
No, the anticipation
of the trick is everything.

888
01:01:33,469 --> 01:01:36,529
We need your showmanship
to build up the suspense.

889
01:01:36,605 --> 01:01:40,166
Once Root opens his mouth, it's over.
He can't introduce this trick.

890
01:01:40,242 --> 01:01:42,972
Of course I can. I'm the Great Danton.

get out of that wardrobe and makeup.

No, it's the trick.
It isn't good enough.

898
01:02:05,668 --> 01:02:09,001
BORDEN's trick is nothing
compared to ours. He has no style.

899
01:02:09,071 --> 01:02:12,939
He doesn't spend the finale
hiding under the stage.

- Why?

901

So I can do it better.

I need you to go and work for him.

You'll be my spy.

version. Imagine what we'd do

908

with the real illusion. We'd have the
greatest magic act anyone's ever seen.

- He knows I work for you.
- Exactly why he'll want to hire you.

910
01:02:46,375 --> 01:02:48,935
- He'll want my secret.
- Why would he trust me?

Because you're
gonna tell him the truth.

doing the trick until Borden opens,
