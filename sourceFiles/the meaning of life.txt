00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:44,745
I've given this long
and careful thought,

351
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:47,581
and it has to be medical
experiments for the lot of you.

(SINGING SADLY)
<i>Every sperm is sacred</i>

354
00:31:55,455 --> 00:32:00,131
<i>Every sperm is great</i>

355
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,806
Look at them. Bloody Catholics.
Filling the bloody world up

356
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:08,385
with bloody people they can't
afford to bloody feed.

357
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:13,016
What are we, dear? Protestant,
and fiercely proud of it.

358
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,817
Well, why do they have
so many children?

359
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:19,863
Because every time they have sexual
intercourse, they have to have a baby.

360
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,109
But it's the same with us, Harry.
What do you mean?

361
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,410
Well, I mean
we've got two children,

362
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:28,038
and we've had
sexual intercourse twice.

363
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:31,413
That's not the point. We could
have it any time we wanted.

364
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,585
Really?
Oh, yes. And what's more,

365
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,038
because we don't believe
in all that Papist claptrap,

366
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,089
we can take precautions.

367
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,083
What, you mean
lock the door?

368
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:44,513
No, no. I mean because we are members
of the Protestant Reformed Church,

369
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,465
which successfully challenged
the autocratic power

370
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,642
of the Papacy
in the mid-sixteenth century,

371
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:51,687
we can wear little rubber
devices to prevent issue.

372
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,808
What do you mean?

373
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,767
I could, if I wanted, have
sexual intercourse with you.

374
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:57,066
Oh, yes, Harry.

375
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,691
And by wearing a rubber sheath
over my old fellow,

376
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:03,357
I could ensure that when I came
off, you would not be impregnated.

377
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:07,077
Ooh! That's what being a
Protestant's all about.

378
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,654
That's why
it's the church for me.

379
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,159
That's why
it's the church for anyone

380
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,412
who respects the individual
and the individual's right

381
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,577
to decide for him
or herself.

382
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:20,131
When Martin Luther nailed his protest
up to the church door in 1517,

383
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:23,256
he may not have realized the full
significance of what he was doing

384
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,422
but 400 years later,
thanks to him, my dear,

385
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,304
I can wear whatever I want
on my John Thomas.

386
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:33,437
And Protestantism doesn't stop
at the simple condom. Oh, no!

387
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,147
I can wear French Ticklers if I want.
You what?

388
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:39,397
French Ticklers, Black
Mambos, Crocodile Ribs...

389
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,192
Sheaths that are designed
not only to protect,

390
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,740
but also to enhance the
stimulation of sexual congress.

391
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,698
Have you got one?
Have I got one? Well, no,

392
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:51,951
but I can go down the road anytime
I want and walk into Harry's

393
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,034
and hold my head up high and
say, in a loud, steady voice,

394
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,665
"Harry, I want you
to sell me a condom.

395
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:01,624
"In fact, today I think I'll have a
French Tickler, for I am a Protestant."

396
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,509
Well, why don't you?
But they, they cannot,

397
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,884
because their church never made the
great leap out of the Middle Ages

398
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:11,183
and the domination
of alien Episcopal supremacy.

405
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,451
in Kadesh Bilgemath,

406
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:39,628
by Shor Ethra Regalion,

407
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:44,083
to the house of
Gash-Bil-Bethuel-Bazda,

408
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,884
he who brought the butter dish
to Balshazar,

409
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,430
and the tent peg
to the house of Rashomon,

410
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,429
and there,
slew they the goats,

411
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:59,015
yea, and placed they
the bits in little pots.

412
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,058
Here endeth the lesson.

413
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,065
Let us praise God.

414
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:12,654
O Lord.
ALL: O Lord.

415
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:16,244
Ooh! You are so big.

416
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,125
ALL: Ooh! You are so big.

417
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,124
So absolutely huge.

418
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:26,295
ALL: So absolutely huge.

419
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:31,505
Gosh, we're all really impressed
down here, I can tell You.

420
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:36,306
Gosh, we're all really impressed
down here, I can tell you.

421
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:41,015
Forgive us, O Lord, for this,
our dreadful toadying.

422
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,526
ALL: And barefaced flattery.

423
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,820
But you're so strong,

424
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:50,490

425
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,034
ALL: Fantastic.

426
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:55,537
Amen, Reverend.
Amen.

00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:58,912
Now two boys have been found
rubbing linseed oil

428
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,038
into the school cormorant.

429
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,881
Now some of you may feel that the
cormorant does not play an important part

430
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,128
in the life of the school,
but I would remind you

431
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:12,762
that it was presented to us by the
corporation of the town of Sudbury,

432
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:15,765
to commemorate Empire Day,
when we try to remember

433
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,593
the names of all those
from the Sudbury area,

434
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,684
who so gallantly
gave their lives

435
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:24,186
to keep China British.

436
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:28,771
So from now on, the cormorant
is strictly out of bounds!

00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:55,031
Now, before I begin the
lesson, will those of you

458
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,992
who are playing in the match this
afternoon move your clothes down

459
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,946
onto the lower peg
immediately after lunch,

460
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,451
before you write
your letter home,

461
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,283
if you're not getting your hair cut,
unless you've got a younger brother,

462
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,915
who's going out this weekend as the
guest of another boy, in which case,

463
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,712
collect his note before lunch,

464
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:12,007
put it in your letter after
you have had your haircut,

465
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:15,085
and make sure he moves your clothes
down onto the lower peg for you.

466
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:16,215
Now...
Sir?

467
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,511
Yes, Wymer?

468
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:19,806
My younger brother's going out
with Dibble this weekend, sir.

469
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:22,634
But I'm not having my hair cut
today, so do I move my clothes...

470
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:26,017
I do wish you'd listen, Wymer.
It's perfectly simple.

471
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,597
If you're not
getting your hair cut,

472
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,308
you don't have to move your brother's
clothes down to the lower peg.

473
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,144
You simply collect his note
before lunch,

474
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,071
after you've done
your scripture prep,

475
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,740
when you've written
your letter home before rest,

476
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,910
move your own clothes
onto the lower peg,

477
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,154
greet the visitors
and report to Mr. Viney

478
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:43,910

00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,575

Sex, sex, sex.
Where were we?

481
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,383
Well, had I got as far as

482
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:03,217
the penis entering the vagina?

483
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,892
No, sir.
No, sir. No, sir.

484
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,437
Well, had I done foreplay?

485
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:15,812
STU DENTS: Yes, sir.

486
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:19,195
Ah. Well, as we all know
all about foreplay,

487
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:23,575
no doubt you can tell me what
the purpose of foreplay is.

488
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,205
Biggs.

489
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:32,291
Don't know.
Sorry, sir.

490
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:33,789
Carter?

491
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:38,377
Oh, was it taking
your clothes off, sir?

492
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,467
Well, and after that?

493
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,549
Oh, putting them
on a lower peg, sir.

494
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:51,147
The purpose of foreplay is to
cause the vagina to lubricate,

495
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,977
so that the penis
can penetrate more easily.

496
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,944
Could we have a window open,
please, sir?

497
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,613
Yes. Harris, will you?

498
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:01,316
And, of course, to cause
the man's penis to erect

499
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,739
and harden.

500
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,703
(IN HALING)

501
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:10,083
Now, did I do
vaginal juices last week?

502
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,910
Oh, do pay attention,
Wadsworth!

503
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:14,212
I know it's Friday. Watching
the football, are you?

504
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:17,541
Boy, move over there.
I'm warning you.

505
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,718
I may decide
to set an exam this term.

506
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,929
Oh, sir!
Sir!

507
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:25,223
So just listen.

508
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:30,470
Now did I or did I not

509
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,682
do vaginal juices?

510
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:35,434
STU DENTS: Yes, sir.

511
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:39,692
Name two ways of getting them
flowing, Watson.

512
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,114
Rubbing the clitoris, sir?

513
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:49,364
What's wrong
with a kiss, boy? Hmm?

514
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,621
Why not start her off
with a nice kiss?

515
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,377
You don't
have to go leaping

516
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,454
straight for the clitoris
like a bull at a gate.

517
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,881
Give her a kiss, boy.

518
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:03,212
Suck the nipple, sir?
Good, good. Well done, Wymer.

519
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,638
Stroking the thighs, sir?
Yes, yes.

520
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,636
I suppose so.
Biting the neck.

521
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,809
Yes, good.
Nibbling the earlobe,

522
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,558
kneading the buttocks
and so on and so forth.

523
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,890
So we have
all these possibilities,

524
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:19,232
before we stampede
towards the clitoris, Watson.

525
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,484
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

526
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,736
Now, all these forms
of stimulation

527
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,285
can now take place.

528
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,793
And, of course, tonguing
will give you the best idea

529
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:42,588
of how the juices
are coming along.

530
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:46,297
Helen?
Now, penetration and coitus,

531
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:50,429
that is to say intercourse
up to and including orgasm.

532
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:56,265
Ah, hello, dear. Do stand up when
my wife enters the room, Carter.

533
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,974
Oh, sorry, sir. Sorry.

534
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,684
H ELEN: Humphrey, I hope
you don't mind.

535
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,236
I told the Garfields we would
dine with them tonight.

536
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,188
Yes, yes, well,
I suppose we must.

537
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:06,115
I said we'd be
there by 8:00.

538
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:08,993
At least it'll give me a reason
to wind up the staff meeting.

539
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:11,951
I know you don't like them, but
I couldn't make another excuse.

540
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,828
It's just that I felt...

541
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:18,078
Wymer, this is
for your benefit.

542
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,289
Would you kindly
wake up?

543
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,291
I've no intention of going
through this all again.

544
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:37,389
We'll take the foreplay as
read, if you don't mind, dear.

545
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:38,564
No, of course not,
Humphrey.

546
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:43,145
So, the man starts by entering
or mounting his good lady wife,

547
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,025
in the standard way.

548
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:50,281
The penis is now, as you will
observe, more or less fully erect.

549
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:52,821
There we are,
that's better.

550
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,118
Now, Carter.

551
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,663
Yes, sir?
What is it?

552
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,668
It's an ocarina, sir.
Bring it up here.

553
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:07,260
The man now starts making thrusting
movements with his pelvic area,

554
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:10,259
moving the penis up and down
inside the vagina.

555
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:14,218
Put it there, boy.
Put it there on the table.

556
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,271
While the wife maximizes her clitoral
stimulation by the shaft of the penis,

557
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,098
by pushing forward.

558
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:21,520
Thank you, dear.

559
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,945
What's funny, Biggs?

560
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:27,943
Oh, nothing, sir.

561
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,366
Do, please, share your little
joke with the rest of us.

562
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:33,282
I mean, obviously, something
frightfully funny's going on.

No, honestly, sir.

00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:35,997
Well, as it's so funny,

565
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:39,372

to play for the boys' team,

No. We're doing it for a bet.

852
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:31,985
God told us to do it.

853
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:34,822
To tell the truth,
we are completely mad.

854
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:37,283
We're inmates of a Bengali
psychiatric institution,

855
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:42,087
and we escaped by making this skin
out of old used cereal packets.

856
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:44,460
PERKINS: It doesn't matter!
What?

857
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:48,165
It doesn't matter why
they're dressed as a tiger.

858
00:59:48,191 --> 00:59:49,786
Have they got my leg?

859
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,510
Good thinking.
Well, have you?

860
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,933
Actually...
Yes?

861
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,181
We were thinking of
training as taxidermists.

862
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,308
We wanted to get the feel of it
from the animal's point of view.

863
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:00,434
Be quiet!

864
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:02,937
Now look,
we're just asking you

865
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,939
if you've got
this man's leg.

866
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,983
A wooden leg?
No, no, a proper leg.

867
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:13,115
He was fast asleep, and someone or
something came in and removed it.

868
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,700
Without waking him up?

869
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:20,250
Yes.
I don't believe you.

870
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:23,044
We found the tiger skin
in a bicycle shop in Cairo.

871
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,963
The owner wanted it
taken to Dar Es Salaam.

872
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,005
Shut up!

873
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:29,756
Now look, have you or
have you not got his leg?

874
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:33,764
Yes. No. No, no, no, no.
No. No, no, no.

875
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:37,851
Why did you say yes?
I didn't.

876
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:39,553
I'm not talking to you.

877
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:42,898
Um...

878
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,309
Um...

879
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,941
Right. Search the thicket.

880
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,690
Oh, come on.
I mean, do we look like

881
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,571
the sort of chaps who'd
creep into a camp at night,

882
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,574
steal into someone's tent,
anaesthetize them, tissue-type them,

883
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,906
amputate a leg
and run away with it?

884
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:01,074
Search the thicket.

885
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,869
Oh, leg!
You're looking for a leg!

886
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:06,205
Actually, I think there
is one there somewhere.

887
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:08,131
Somebody must have
abandoned it here,

888
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,879
knowing you were
coming after it.

889
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:11,881
We stumbled across it, actually,
and wondered what it was.

890
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,212
They'll be miles away
by now.

891

all the blame.

Hello and welcome

and invite you, the audience,

895
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:37,277
to join us, the filmmakers,
in Find the Fish.

896
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:40,831
We're going to show you
a scene from another film

897
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:43,659
and ask you to guess
where the fish is.

898
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:46,495
But if you think you know,
don't keep it to yourselves.

Yell out so that all the
cinema can hear you.

900
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:52,088
So here we are
with Find the Fish.

901
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,560
I wonder
where that fish has gone.

902
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,562
You did love it so.

903
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:10,690
You looked after it
like a son.

904
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:15,070
And it went
wherever I did go.

905
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:18,778
Is it in the cupboard?
AU DIENCE: Yes! No!

906
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:23,206
Wouldn't you like to know?
It was a lovely little fish.

907
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:28,082
And it went
wherever I did go.

908
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:32,541
MAN: It's behind the sofa!
Where can that fish be?

909
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,172
MAN 2: Have you thought of
the drawers in the bureau?

910
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:38,347
It is a most
elusive fish.

911
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:42,597
And it went
wherever I did go.

912
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:46,852
Oh! Fishy, fishy,

Oh! Fishy, fishy,

915
01:02:56,606 --> 01:03:00,736
That went
wherever I did go.

916

MAN 3: Look up his trunk! MAN 4: Yeah!
It's in his trousers!

917
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:06,867
That was terrific!
Great! Yeah!

918
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:10,545
Best bit so far.
Fantastic! Really great!

919
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,873
Really risky, yeah.

920
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:20,051
They haven't said much about the
meaning of life so far, have they?

921
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:22,640
Well, it's been building up to it.
Has it?

922
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:25,640
Yeah, I expect
they'll get onto it now.

923
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:27,437
Personally, I doubt

924
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:30,140
they're going to say anything
about the meaning of life at all.

925
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,941
Oh, come on.
They've gotta say something.

926
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:33,269
They're bound to.

927
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,228
Yeah.

the next bit will be?

01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,758

What kind of food you
like to eat this evening?

941
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,348
Well, we sort of
like pineapple.

942
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:13,354
Yeah, we love pineapple.

943
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:16,312
Yeah, anything with pineapple
in is great for us.

944
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,943

the dungeon room?

That's philosophy.
Is that a sport?

965
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:33,183
No, it's more of an attempt

966
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:37,188
to construct a viable hypothesis
to explain the meaning of life.

No.

Righty-ho! Well,

985
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:32,497
see, throughout history, there've
been certain men and women,

who've tried to find the solution
to the mysteries of existence.

Great!

And we call these guys
philosophers.

Oh! And that's what we're talking about.

He's cute.
Yeah, real understanding.

998
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:05,947
Oh! I never knew Schopenhauer
was a philosopher.

999
01:07:07,315 --> 01:07:10,945
Oh, yeah. He's the one
that begins with an "S."

1000
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:15,118
Oh.

1001
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:19,502
Like Nietzsche.

1002
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:23,422
Does Nietzsche
begin with an "S"?

1003
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:28,052
There's an "S" in Nietzsche.

1004
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,965
Oh, well, yes, there is.

1005
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:35,135
Do all philosophers
have an "S" in them?

1006
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,846
Yeah. I think most of them do.

1007
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:42,855
Oh. Does that mean Salena
Jones is a philosopher?

1008
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:46,153
Yeah! Right! She could be.

1009
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,531
She sings about
the meaning of life.

1010
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:53,495
Yeah. That's right, but I don't
think she writes her own material.

1011
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:57,575
No. Oh, maybe Schopenhauer
writes her material.

1012
01:07:57,991 --> 01:08:00,335
No. Burt Bacharach writes it.

1013
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:03,626
There's no "S"
in Burt Bacharach.

1014
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:05,965
Or in Hal David.

1015
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,676
Who's Hal David?

1016
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:12,180
He writes the lyrics.
Burt just writes the tunes.

1017
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:15,850

to Carole Bayer Sager.

1127

Now, Harry, you've had
some thoughts on this.

1128
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:45,508
I've had a team working on
this over the past few weeks,

1129
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:50,134
and what we've come up with can be
reduced to two fundamental concepts.

1130
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:53,682
One. People are not wearing enough hats.

1131
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:56,974
Two. Matter is energy.

1132
01:15:57,386 --> 01:16:02,233
In the universe, there are many energy
fields which we cannot normally perceive.

1133
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:07,272
Some energies have a spiritual source,
which act upon a person's soul.

1134
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:11,610
However, this soul
does not exist <i>ab initio,</i>

1135
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:14,366
as orthodox Christianity
teaches.

1136
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,743
It has to be
brought into existence,

1137
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:19,951
by a process of guided
self-observation.

1138
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:24,543
However, this is rarely achieved,
owing to man's unique ability

1139
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:28,877
to be distracted from spiritual
matters by everyday trivia.

1140
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:35,345
What was that about
hats again?

1141
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:38,936
Oh, people aren't
wearing enough.

1142
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,433
Is this true?

1143
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:42,561
Certainly.
Hat sales have increased,

1144
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,142
but not pari passu,
as our research...

1145
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:46,774

enough for what purpose?

1146
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:49,321
Can I just ask, with reference
to your second point,

1147
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:53,948
when you say souls don't develop
because people become distracted...

01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:58,865

that building there before?

01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:45,781
<i>(SINGING) Just remember that
you're standing on a planet</i>

1518
01:44:45,863 --> 01:44:50,039
<i>That's evolving and revolving
at 900 miles an hour</i>

1519
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:55,089
<i>It's orbiting at 19 miles
a second, so it's reckoned</i>

1520
01:44:55,164 --> 01:44:58,213
<i>A sun that is the source
of all our power</i>

1521
01:44:59,084 --> 01:45:02,884
<i>The sun and you and me and all
the stars that we can see</i>

1522
01:45:03,005 --> 01:45:06,225
<i>Are moving
at a million miles a day</i>

1523
01:45:07,009 --> 01:45:10,980
<i>In an outer spiral arm
at 40,000 miles an hour</i>

1524
01:45:11,055 --> 01:45:13,899
<i>Of the galaxy
we call the Milky Way</i>

1525
01:45:22,942 --> 01:45:26,867
<i>Our galaxy itself contains
a hundred billion stars</i>

1526
01:45:26,946 --> 01:45:30,166
<i>It's a hundred thousand
light years side to side</i>

1527
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:34,295
<i>It bulges in the middle
16,000 light years thick</i>

1528
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:38,000
<i>But out by us, it's just
3,000 light years wide</i>

1529
01:45:38,874 --> 01:45:42,469
<i>We're 30,000 light years
from galactic central point</i>

1530
01:45:42,545 --> 01:45:45,549
<i>We go round every
200 million years</i>

1531
01:45:46,632 --> 01:45:50,227
<i>And our galaxy is only
one of millions of billions</i>

1532
01:45:50,302 --> 01:45:53,522
<i>In this amazing
and expanding universe</i>

1533
01:46:26,005 --> 01:46:30,431
<i>The universe itself keeps on
expanding and expanding</i>

1534
01:46:30,509 --> 01:46:33,638
<i>In all of the directions
it can whizz</i>

1535
01:46:34,513 --> 01:46:38,359
<i>As fast as it can go at the
speed of light, you know</i>

1536
01:46:38,475 --> 01:46:41,979
<i>Twelve million miles a minute and
that's the fastest speed there is</i>

1537
01:46:42,062 --> 01:46:46,238
<i>So remember when you're feeling
very small and insecure</i>

1538
01:46:46,317 --> 01:46:49,491
<i>How amazingly unlikely
is your birth</i>

1539
01:46:50,571 --> 01:46:53,825
<i>And pray that there's intelligent
life somewhere up in space</i>

1540
01:46:53,908 --> 01:46:56,787
<i>'Cause there's bugger all
down here on Earth</i>
