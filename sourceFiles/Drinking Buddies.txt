for the anniversary party?

Good.
Good?

00:02:28,794 --> 00:02:30,094
Yep. All set.

00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:31,496
Good or great?
Really great.

Oh, oh, okay.
And you're gonna hate this.

45
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:37,369
Will you call the distributors,
each one individually,

46
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:38,803
and speak to someone there

47
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:40,172
and make sure that they know
they're invited?

48
00:02:40,174 --> 00:02:41,506
You're, like, you know,

49
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:42,507
the face and voice
of this brewery, so...

50
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:44,243
Yeah.

51
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:45,244
You know, they need
to make a connection with you,

52
00:02:45,246 --> 00:02:47,113
and that way, you know...

53
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:48,314
I know it's a little political,
but if you did that for me,

54
00:02:48,316 --> 00:02:49,682
it would make me
very, very, very happy.

55
00:02:49,684 --> 00:02:51,551
Sure thing. Yep, sure.
I'll get on that.

56
00:02:51,553 --> 00:02:54,387
All right.
Oh, oh, um...

57
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:56,556
Uh...

58
00:02:56,558 --> 00:02:57,724
That's it. That's it.

59
00:02:57,726 --> 00:02:59,593
Okay, thanks.
Okay, all right.

60
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:03,864
Hey, what are you,
running through the warehouse?

61
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:05,632
I have to go make
so many phone calls.

62
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:08,368
Can I make beer instead,
and you go make phone calls?

63
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,836
Uh, no, no.

64
00:03:09,838 --> 00:03:11,206
how are the eyes?

65
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,807
They're... they're good,

66
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:15,643
despite boiling wort
being thrown into them.

67
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:17,378
Well, look,
I apologize about that.

68
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,913
It's good.
I've been baptized.

69
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:20,281
See ya.
Lunch?

70
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,282
Yes, yes.

71
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,551
Okay.

72
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:26,589
Okay, Tom, I have to go.

73
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:27,890
Yep, I'll see you there.

74
00:03:27,892 --> 00:03:30,326
Okay, thank you.

75
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,163
Hey.
Hey!

76
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:35,731
I've got some food for Kate.

77
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:37,466
That is me.

78
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:41,538
If you could
just sign this guy for me.

79
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:46,876
Awesome.

80
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:47,877
Thank you.

81
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:48,878
Thanks.

82
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,879
Enjoy.

83
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:51,281
Hey, do you have a fridge?

84
00:03:51,283 --> 00:03:52,583
Do I have a fridge?

85
00:03:52,585 --> 00:03:53,818
'Cause you can have a magnet.

86
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,820
A magnet, ooh.

87
00:03:55,822 --> 00:03:56,821
Yeah.

88
00:03:56,823 --> 00:03:57,922
I love Revolution Brewing.

89
00:03:57,924 --> 00:03:59,190
I really do.

90
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:00,191
Thank you!
Thank you.

91
00:04:00,193 --> 00:04:01,225
We love you too.

92
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:02,793
I love you too.

93
00:04:10,403 --> 00:04:11,603
Uh-oh.

94
00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:12,604
Security!

95
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:13,605
Hey!

96
00:04:13,607 --> 00:04:14,740
Security!

97
00:04:14,742 --> 00:04:15,807
Ugh.

98
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:17,809
Oh, we smell so bad!

99
00:04:19,347 --> 00:04:20,613
Look at this, some Greek salad?

100
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:21,748
Eat it.
I fucking hate it.

101
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,849
It's disgusting.

102
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:24,417
I'm trying not to get scurvy.

103
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:25,418
Boing!

104
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,654
Come on, not my fucking beer!

105
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:30,923
Oh, that's an expert
beer-tasting technique.

106
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:33,727
Enjoy your fries.

107
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:35,429
I'm still gonna eat.

108
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:36,964
That doesn't...
that doesn't do anything.

109
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:38,432
That doesn't do anything to me.

110
00:04:38,434 --> 00:04:39,767
Come out
drinking with us tonight.

111
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:41,402
Okay, yeah.

112
00:04:41,404 --> 00:04:42,670
You're in?
Sure.

113
00:04:42,672 --> 00:04:44,438
Awesome.
Mm-hmm.

114
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,874
They go,
"Oh, my name... my name is Jim.

115
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:47,542
This is my wife, Carol."

116
00:04:47,544 --> 00:04:49,711
You went... "Oh, this is Carol.
That's my"...

117
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:51,946
You don't need to know
their names.

118
00:04:51,948 --> 00:04:53,448
But so this guy comes up to me,

119
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,016
and I know
he's gonna fuck with us.

120
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:57,319
And so in my head, I think
about what my mother said,

121
00:04:57,321 --> 00:04:58,953
and I have the vision,

122
00:04:58,955 --> 00:05:00,790
like from, you know,
the voice of God.

123
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:03,526
This guy's name is Chris Cook.

124
00:05:03,528 --> 00:05:06,028
And so I go,
"Hey, man, you're Chris Cook."

125
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,630
That's not a Korean name,
though.

126
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:09,965
No, he's not...
this is not the Korean.

127
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:11,634
I thought
that it just didn't work.

128
00:05:11,636 --> 00:05:12,769
No, the guy's name was...

129
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,338
Where did you get Chris Cook?

130
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,939
It was a voice, the theory...
it was a voice...

131
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:19,476
Hey!
Hey!

132
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:20,477
You made it.

133
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,712
Gentlemen.

134
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:23,313
Everybody remembers Jill.
Hi.

135
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:24,781
Good seeing you.
Good seeing you too.

136
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,584
How's it goin'?
Good.

137
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:28,720
What do you want to drink?
You want something to drink?

138
00:05:28,722 --> 00:05:29,987
Uh, yeah, yeah.

139
00:05:29,989 --> 00:05:31,422
Yeah, I will
have a Bell's Amber.

140
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:34,025
Bell's Amber.
Bell's Amber.

141
00:05:34,027 --> 00:05:35,693
Thank you.

142
00:05:43,436 --> 00:05:44,436
There you are.

143
00:05:44,438 --> 00:05:46,772
Oh, thank you.

144
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:54,481
If your party bus flips over,

145
00:05:54,483 --> 00:05:57,650
how long before you think
you get to go party foul?

146
00:05:57,652 --> 00:05:58,651
What?

147
00:05:58,653 --> 00:05:59,652
Would you shut up?

148
00:05:59,654 --> 00:06:00,987
Well, I'm just saying.

149
00:06:00,989 --> 00:06:02,756
Would you please,
for once in your life...

150
00:06:02,758 --> 00:06:04,457
Party foul.

151
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:06,694
Once in your life,
right before you talk, Frank,

152
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:08,429
just go,
"I'm not gonna talk."

153
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,600
I'm thinking about heading out.

154
00:06:12,602 --> 00:06:13,768
Let's do one more beer.

155
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,970
Oh, no, no, no,
you should stay.

156
00:06:15,972 --> 00:06:17,438
You should hang out with Frank.

157
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,706
One more beer.
Oh, no, I'm fine.

158
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:19,907
We'll split one.

159
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:21,476
No, baby, I got to go.
I got to go.

160
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:22,944
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm going for sure.

161
00:06:22,946 --> 00:06:24,646
I'm going for sure.
I'm gonna go with.

162
00:06:24,648 --> 00:06:25,947
Yeah?
Yes.

163
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:27,716
Okay.

164
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:28,784
Gentlemen.

165
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:30,485
You out?
Good night.

166
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:31,987
Good night, Kate.
We'll see you at work.

167
00:06:31,989 --> 00:06:33,890
Bye!

168
00:06:33,892 --> 00:06:36,526

00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:41,796
No, I'm not hungry.

186
00:07:41,798 --> 00:07:44,432
I just want beer.

187
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:46,033
Yeah?

188
00:07:46,035 --> 00:07:48,803
You haven't drank
any of the beer I brought you.

189
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:51,005
I've had a couple of them.

190
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,575
How was your night?

191
00:07:54,577 --> 00:07:55,811
Good.

192
00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:57,179
Yeah?

193
00:07:57,181 --> 00:08:00,949
Yeah, we played pool
at the Empty Bottle.

194
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:01,950
Oh, the Bottle.

195
00:08:01,952 --> 00:08:02,985
You know that place?

196
00:08:02,987 --> 00:08:04,052
I've heard of it, yeah.

197
00:08:04,054 --> 00:08:07,789
No, I've been to the Bottle.

198
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,960
What'd you do today?

199
00:08:10,962 --> 00:08:13,696
I met with a couple of kids
at the studio

200
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:15,665
that I think
are gonna do an album.

201
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:17,767
Yeah, they got a pretty decent
little sound.

202
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,569
They're kind of...

203
00:08:19,571 --> 00:08:23,841
a little bit freak rock,
a little noisy.

204
00:08:23,843 --> 00:08:25,776
But they have this girl
who plays the cello,

205
00:08:25,778 --> 00:08:27,878
and I think
that's supposed to be ironic,

206
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,647
but I can't tell anymore.

207
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:32,650
But, uh, so we'll just
stick a mic on her and go.

208
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:36,988
You sure
you don't want a plate?

209
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,691
Mm-mm.

210
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:41,860
Here.

211
00:08:41,862 --> 00:08:43,061
Really?

212
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:44,062
Yeah.

213
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:45,497
Mmm, are you done?

214
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:46,498
Yeah.

215
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,133
Oh, my God.

216
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:50,970
Thank you.

No, no.

223
00:09:20,103 --> 00:09:21,569
No. I always forget.

224
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:23,905
I got it.

225
00:09:23,907 --> 00:09:24,939
I'm awful.

226
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:25,940
You're not awful.

227
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:27,542
Oh, okay.

228
00:09:27,544 --> 00:09:29,010
You're just really hard
on furniture.

229
00:09:30,815 --> 00:09:32,681
Mid-century,
classic 18th.

230
00:09:32,683 --> 00:09:36,118
It's terrible.

231
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,621
Thanks for coming to see me.

232
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:40,956
You're welcome.

233
00:09:47,164 --> 00:09:48,164
Oh, shit.

234
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,265
What?

235
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:51,034
Oh, I got something, and I...

236
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:52,736
I forgot.

237
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:55,572
I bought you something today.

238
00:09:55,574 --> 00:09:57,341
I'll be right back.
One sec.

239
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,818
Uh, you might hate it.

240
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,286
You'll prob...
you'll probably hate it.

241
00:10:09,288 --> 00:10:10,922
I won't hate it.

242
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:12,691
But you might come around
and then love it.

243
00:10:12,693 --> 00:10:14,893
Book!

244
00:10:14,895 --> 00:10:17,996
What is it?

245
00:10:17,998 --> 00:10:21,166
That is back
when men wrote about God,

246
00:10:21,168 --> 00:10:22,934
pussy, and themselves.

247
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:25,605
It's like, of all the sort of
fellow narcissists,

248
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:27,707
that's the one.

249
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:28,708
Thank you.

250
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,176
Sure.

251
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:31,978
You kind of remind me
a little bit of the hero.

252
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,979
Really? Is she a...

253
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:34,213
Yeah, in a weird way.

254
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:35,281
It's he, but...
It's a he.

255
00:10:35,283 --> 00:10:37,685
It's thematic.

256
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:38,786
Awesome.

257
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:40,187
You're a kindred spirit.

258
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:41,622
Thank you.

259
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:44,124
You're a runner.

260
00:10:44,126 --> 00:10:46,393
You're a rabbit.

261
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,895
I am a little bit
like a rabbit.

262
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,730
You are.

263
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:55,103
Damn it.

264
00:10:55,105 --> 00:10:58,173
I can't find my sock.

265
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,209
You sure you don't want
to just spend the night?

266
00:11:01,211 --> 00:11:02,944
No, I have to be home
in the morning

267
00:11:02,946 --> 00:11:05,748
'cause I'm having
something delivered.

268
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,083
But you should stay in bed.

269
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:08,150
Go to sleep.

270
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,256
All right,
how about I call you a car?

271
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:15,725
No, 'cause I have my bike.

272
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:17,259
I'm just gonna ride.

273
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,296
Just throw it in the back
of the cab or something.

274
00:11:19,298 --> 00:11:20,330
I'll give you some money.

275
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:22,199
No, thank you.

276
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:23,333
I feel bad.

277
00:11:23,335 --> 00:11:26,303
Don't feel bad.

278
00:11:26,305 --> 00:11:27,838
I feel bad.

279
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,439
Don't feel bad.

280
00:11:55,935 --> 00:11:57,402
No, really, really, really.

281
00:11:57,404 --> 00:11:58,438
Really?

282
00:11:59,975 --> 00:12:02,809
No! No!
You're gonna get me fired!

283
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:03,810
Oh, gross!

284
00:12:03,812 --> 00:12:04,944
Sorry.

285
00:12:04,946 --> 00:12:06,246
Get out.
I'm leaving.

286
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:08,848
Ow!

287
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,150
Please, please, please.

288
00:12:10,152 --> 00:12:11,284
Stop it.

289
00:12:11,286 --> 00:12:12,887
Now you're just being mean.

290
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:14,355
Okay. All right.

291
00:12:14,357 --> 00:12:17,892
So you don't need me
to do anything.

292
00:12:17,894 --> 00:12:21,195
I mean, no, if everything
is all taken care of,

293
00:12:21,197 --> 00:12:24,098
then I guess, you know,
we should be fine, I guess.

294
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,467
Okay.
Yeah.

295
00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:27,035
Are you gonna be all right?

296
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:30,505
I'm... I'm fine.

297
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:31,506
Okay.

298
00:12:31,508 --> 00:12:32,741
Yeah.

299
00:12:32,743 --> 00:12:33,742
I like both.

300
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:35,143
I like a short beard.

301
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:36,878
I like... I like your beard...
Well, this...

302
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,380
Like, if it was longer
than this,

303
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,183
then I'd be worried
it would be like a hipster

304
00:12:40,185 --> 00:12:42,185
or homeless dot com
kind of situation.

305
00:12:42,187 --> 00:12:43,820
But this is an okay range.

306
00:12:43,822 --> 00:12:45,054
I like it.

307
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,289
Hi, guys.
Hey, how are you?

308
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,890
Hi. Good.

309
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,225
You like nice.
Oh, thank you very much.

310
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,993
This place is gorgeous.
Did you do most of this?

311
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:52,061
Yeah, it looks awesome.
Did you do most of this?

312
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,797
Yeah, I didn't do much.

313
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,265
I just put some plants
in the growlers and the food...

314
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:56,934
No, it looks amazing.

315
00:12:56,936 --> 00:12:58,302
Why are you so stressed?
It's going great.

316
00:12:58,304 --> 00:12:59,303
It's good, right?
It's great.

317
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:00,838
Okay, good.

318
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,472
The chocolate pretzels
are a humongous hit.

319
00:13:02,474 --> 00:13:04,441
Good, good. Great.
It's hot, sorry.

320
00:13:04,443 --> 00:13:05,977
It's so hot.

321
00:13:05,979 --> 00:13:07,979
Just encourages more drinking.
Yeah, exactly.

322
00:13:07,981 --> 00:13:09,147
I think it's good party plan.

323
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:10,548
Ah! Sorry.

324
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,383
Chris is here.
I'm gonna go get him.

325
00:13:12,385 --> 00:13:14,052
Okay.
I'll be right back.

326
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:15,454
Bring him back over here,
all right?

327
00:13:15,455 --> 00:13:16,955
Okay.
Chris is her boyfriend?

328
00:13:16,957 --> 00:13:18,389
Chris is the boyfriend, yes.

329
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:19,925
Baby.

330
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:21,093
Hey.
Mwah.

331
00:13:21,095 --> 00:13:22,428
Welcome!

332
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,129
I was just looking for you.
Thank you.

333
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:25,130
Come in. Jess.

334
00:13:25,132 --> 00:13:28,100
Jessica, he's with me.

335
00:13:28,102 --> 00:13:29,101
Wow, this is great.

336
00:13:29,103 --> 00:13:30,102
This looks great.

337
00:13:30,104 --> 00:13:31,103
Did you do all of this?

338
00:13:31,105 --> 00:13:33,006
I did.
Wow.

339
00:13:33,008 --> 00:13:35,876
Wow, it's...
yeah, it's amazing.

340
00:13:35,878 --> 00:13:38,078
- It's a lot of work.
- Yeah.

341
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,379
Here, I want you
to meet some people.

342
00:13:39,381 --> 00:13:40,513
You guys,
this is my boyfriend, Chris.

343
00:13:40,515 --> 00:13:42,349
Hey, how are you?

344
00:13:42,351 --> 00:13:44,084
Chris, this is Jim.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

345
00:13:44,086 --> 00:13:45,318
This is Dawn.
Hey, Jim. How are you?

346
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,554
Pleasure.
Hi, nice to meet you.

347
00:13:46,556 --> 00:13:47,556
And this is Frank's wife.

348
00:13:47,557 --> 00:13:48,890
Frank.
Amy.

349
00:13:48,892 --> 00:13:50,391
Frank.
Hey, Frank's wife.

350
00:13:50,393 --> 00:13:51,492
I can't wait to meet him.

351
00:13:51,494 --> 00:13:53,361
Yeah, he's with Jim right now.

352
00:13:53,363 --> 00:13:54,362
You left him with Jim?

353
00:13:54,364 --> 00:13:56,163
Yeah.

354
00:13:56,165 --> 00:13:58,266
But, um, if I introduce you,
will you not be a dickhead?

355
00:13:58,268 --> 00:13:59,567
And don't call me names,

356
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:01,203
and don't say anything stupid
or mean,

357
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:03,205
and don't, like,
punch me in the face?

358
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:06,341
Get off.

359
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:09,444
All our equipment came in
from Canada.

360
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:10,879
We had it shipped in,

361
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:12,514
and we had it all rigged
and set up,

362
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:14,584
and started brewing
about three months ago.

363
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:16,085
Here you go. Good one.
Thank you.

364
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:17,887
Uh, we'll be back.

365
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:19,889
I'm just gonna introduce him
to some other people.

366
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:21,024
Great to... great to meet you.

367
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,325
Yeah.

368
00:14:25,162 --> 00:14:26,596
Well, then take the shoes off.

369
00:14:26,598 --> 00:14:28,499
No, no.
I'm... I'm such a shorty.

370
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,234
Who cares?

371
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,136
I don't want your friends
to know how short I am.

372
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,504
Ha-ha!

373
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,072
You're the weirdest.
It's a secret.

374
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,307
It's a secret?

375
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,308
All right, I won't tell anyone.

376
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,943
Hey, guys.
Hi!

377
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,177
This is Chris. This is Jill.
Hi, I'm Jill.

378
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,246
Jill, how are you?
This is Luke.

379
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,048
Nice to meet you.
Luke?

380
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,449
Yes, Luke, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, Luke.

381
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:45,450
Nice to meet you.
This is Callie.

382
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,885
Hey, Callie.
Hi.

383
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,019
This is Mike.
How are you? Chris.

384
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,020
Hey. Mike.
Mike? Chris.

385
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,188
It's everybody!

386
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,556
Pleasure, yeah.
Nice to see you.

387
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,024
This is his first time here.
Welcome, man.

388
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,427
Hey, all jokes aside,

389
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:56,195
we've heard
a lot of great things about you,

390
00:14:56,197 --> 00:14:57,430
and we're excited to have you.

391
00:14:57,432 --> 00:14:59,432
Really? Good.
That's great.

392
00:14:59,434 --> 00:15:01,133
Well, what do you think
of the beer, man?

393
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:02,134
Um, well...

394
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:05,237
Have a sip.

395
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,605
Pressure's on now.

396
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:07,941
Big reaction.

397
00:15:07,943 --> 00:15:08,942
What do you taste, sir?

398
00:15:08,944 --> 00:15:10,310
Can you taste the hops?

399
00:15:10,312 --> 00:15:11,979
Uh, I have to go take care
of something.

400
00:15:11,981 --> 00:15:13,447
I taste skinned knees and...

401
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:15,182
I'll be right back.
Will you be cool here?

402
00:15:15,184 --> 00:15:16,683
I will. I will.
Jelly sandwiches and...

403
00:15:16,685 --> 00:15:18,118
Jelly sandwiches!

404
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,953
Dark clouds of puberty
on the horizon.

405
00:15:19,955 --> 00:15:21,489
No, I don't know.

406
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:32,266
Where do you...
where do you teach?

407
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:33,534
I teach at Orr.

408
00:15:33,536 --> 00:15:35,604
I teach Special Ed.

409
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:37,539
Oh. Oh, wow.

410
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,274
Yeah.

411
00:15:39,276 --> 00:15:42,344
Yeah, that's... so you really...
you really teach.

412
00:15:42,346 --> 00:15:43,345
I guess, yeah.

413
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:44,413
I mean... yeah.

414
00:15:44,415 --> 00:15:46,181
You have... yeah.
Yeah.

415
00:15:46,183 --> 00:15:47,984
You have a Master's?

416
00:15:47,986 --> 00:15:51,054
Uh, I was teaching
while I was getting my Master's.

417
00:15:51,056 --> 00:15:52,989
There was a program,
and... yeah.

418
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:56,226
That's, um...
I find that really impressive.

419
00:15:56,228 --> 00:15:58,595
Well, thank you. Yeah.

420
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:03,534
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

421
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:04,535
Sorry.
Oh, I apologize.

422
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:06,103
Oh, pardon me.

423
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:07,538
Oh, I didn't realize
that was you.

424
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,440
Oh, what a gross-looking plate.
I am so hungry.

425
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:10,708
I have not eaten anything
all day.

426
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,742
It's all hot mustard, Kate.

427
00:16:11,744 --> 00:16:13,210
That's all I need.

428
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:16,615
You know, I read something,
ah...

429
00:16:16,617 --> 00:16:18,617
I think Camus wrote about

430
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:22,120
Sisyphus pushing the boulder up,
you know, the hill?

431
00:16:22,122 --> 00:16:24,723
And he always pictured him
smiling?

432
00:16:24,725 --> 00:16:27,092
Um...

433
00:16:27,094 --> 00:16:29,362
You know, as opposed
to a punishment thing,

434
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:32,165
and I feel that sometimes
things that are really hard

435
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,400
can be...
can be really rewarding

436
00:16:34,402 --> 00:16:38,104
because they're hard, you know?

437
00:16:39,107 --> 00:16:40,373
Chris is a great guy.

438
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,607
He is, right?
He's a great guy.

439
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:43,210
He told me about you guys,
though,

440
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:45,112
that weird thing
that happened the other night.

441
00:16:45,114 --> 00:16:46,580
You're a dick.
He didn't say anything.

442
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:48,048
No, he said you're a...

443
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,516
Have fun. Good-bye.
All right.

444
00:16:53,288 --> 00:16:54,755
Thank you.
Thanks for showing me that.

445
00:16:54,757 --> 00:16:56,391
Yeah.
Hey, man, it was really fun.

446
00:16:56,393 --> 00:16:57,725
You get a tour?
Yeah, I did. I did, yeah.

447
00:16:57,727 --> 00:16:58,760
I gave him a tour
of the whole place.

448
00:16:58,762 --> 00:17:00,261
Yeah, it was kind of awesome.

449
00:17:00,263 --> 00:17:01,463
That's cool.
He got into it.

450
00:17:01,465 --> 00:17:04,732
Yeah, um,
who cleans all this up?

451
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:06,634
You're looking at
the cleaning crew right now.

452
00:17:06,636 --> 00:17:08,236
All right, can I help?

453
00:17:08,238 --> 00:17:09,605
We're gonna clean it up.
You guys go.

454
00:17:09,607 --> 00:17:11,140
Really?

455
00:17:11,142 --> 00:17:12,775
Yeah, I talked to Mike
and Frank and the guys.

456
00:17:12,777 --> 00:17:14,143
We're gonna do it.

457
00:17:14,145 --> 00:17:15,277
You set it up.
We'll clean it.

458
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,312
We'll stick around if...

459
00:17:16,314 --> 00:17:17,413
No, you guys, honestly, go.

460
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:18,547
You've done enough.

461
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:19,648
See what I just did?
Yeah?

462
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,816
See that?

463
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:22,251
Thank you.

464
00:17:22,253 --> 00:17:23,453
All right, okay.

465
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,621
I won't say no.
Good to see you.

466
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:25,822
It was so good to see you.

467
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:27,624
You too.
I'll see you soon.

468
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:29,626
Hey, it was a real pleasure.
Yeah, it's awesome.

469
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:31,394
Congratulations on, you know,
the thing.

470
00:17:31,396 --> 00:17:32,629
All right,
I'll see you at work.

471
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:34,397
Really great to meet you.

472
00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:36,567
I heard that we might stop by
your tasting this weekend.

473
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:38,402
Oh, yeah.
No, I hope you do.

474
00:17:38,404 --> 00:17:40,505
I'm there from noon to 2:00,
so whenever you guys want.

475
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:41,739
Ice cream brunch.
I love it.

476
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:42,740
Good night, guys.
Bye.

477
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:44,675
Good night.

478
00:17:44,677 --> 00:17:46,277
I'm not cleaning.

479
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,645
You're cleaning.
I'm not cleaning.

480
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:51,416
Oh, you're cleaning.

481
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:53,218
I'm not lifting a finger.

482
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:56,388
Yeah. No, absolutely.

483
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,357
It's...
we have one, two...

484
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:01,460
I have nine tastings
this month,

485
00:18:01,462 --> 00:18:02,628
but I can put you in.

486
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,731
Kate...

487
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,299
Jill's outside.

488
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:07,567
I'm ready.
I just have to finish.

489
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:08,735
Then let's go.
I'm going.

490
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:11,838
But I can do this next week.

491
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,406
Not this weekend.

492
00:18:13,408 --> 00:18:16,744
Nope,
I have a festival this weekend.

493
00:18:16,746 --> 00:18:18,479
But I can do this next week,

494
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:20,581
and I'll bring whatever
year-ends we have available.

495
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,815
Okay?
Thank you.

496
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:23,184
I'll call you on Monday.

497
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:24,351
Okay, bye.

498
00:18:27,656 --> 00:18:29,423
Have wallet...

499
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,669
All right, I got it.

500
00:18:48,912 --> 00:18:50,179
All right.

501
00:18:50,181 --> 00:18:51,480
Come on in.

502
00:18:51,482 --> 00:18:53,149
Why don't you
put the groceries down,

503
00:18:53,151 --> 00:18:55,251
and we'll just leave 'em,
and...

504
00:18:57,222 --> 00:18:58,322
Wow.

505
00:18:58,324 --> 00:18:59,823
Big reveal.

506
00:18:59,825 --> 00:19:01,692
Oh, yeah, I can't
really take responsibility

507
00:19:01,694 --> 00:19:03,393
for the decoration.

508
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:05,262
My cousin and her kids
kind of come up here a lot.

509
00:19:05,264 --> 00:19:06,630
No, I love it.
She likes patterns.

510
00:19:06,632 --> 00:19:08,265
Most of it
really hasn't been changed

511
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:10,802
probably in 40 years, either.

512
00:19:10,804 --> 00:19:12,604
Um...

513
00:19:17,543 --> 00:19:18,943
All right.

514
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:21,879
Here's a bathroom
if anybody needs it.

515
00:19:21,881 --> 00:19:25,251
Um, I expect you might.

516
00:19:25,253 --> 00:19:27,953
It is... we're on a septic
line,

517
00:19:27,955 --> 00:19:31,657
so try not to put any...
down that thing.

518
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:33,225
Great.

519
00:19:33,227 --> 00:19:34,660
You guys are gonna be
in this room here.

520
00:19:34,662 --> 00:19:35,928
Where do I put my tampons?

521
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,496
You keep them in a bag.

522
00:19:37,498 --> 00:19:38,498
Is this us?

523
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,866
This is you.

524
00:19:39,868 --> 00:19:42,302
What? In a cabin,
you keep them in a bag?

525
00:19:42,304 --> 00:19:43,870
Why don't you two settle in,

526
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:45,739
clean up
if you want to clean up,

527
00:19:45,741 --> 00:19:47,907
and we'll go
put the groceries away,

528
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:49,709
and then, you know,

529
00:19:49,711 --> 00:19:51,812
if you want to crack a beer
or two or something.

530
00:19:51,814 --> 00:19:53,247
Oh, yes, please.

531
00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:54,582
Yeah, welcome,
but just, you know,

532
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:55,750
make yourself at home, okay?

533
00:19:55,752 --> 00:19:57,418
Thank you, man.
Great.

534
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,588
What is that?

535
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,889
It's really cute.

536
00:20:01,891 --> 00:20:03,524
Yeah, it is.

537
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:05,327
I've got you alone in a cabin
with this thing.

538
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,428
How's the bed?

539
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,364
Uh...

540
00:20:09,366 --> 00:20:10,365
Oh, it's squishy.

541
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,466
It is?

542
00:20:11,468 --> 00:20:14,503
It's really... oop.

543
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:17,606
I feel like
we're gonna break it.

544
00:20:17,608 --> 00:20:19,042
We're good.

545
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:38,429
Hi.

546
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:40,464
Morning.

547
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:43,867
You think I could make eggs
or something?

548
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:46,938
Yeah, sure.

549
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,474
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

550
00:20:52,578 --> 00:20:56,715
For a man who has everything,
he's only got little bowls.

551
00:20:56,717 --> 00:20:57,882
Sorry.

552
00:20:57,884 --> 00:20:59,652
That was a terrible joke.

553
00:21:01,822 --> 00:21:03,556
Eggs?

554
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:05,658
Sure, yeah.

555
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,942
You close with your parents?

556
00:21:21,944 --> 00:21:25,045
Sort of.
Sort of.

557
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:26,080
I mean, we talk.

558
00:21:26,082 --> 00:21:27,081
I talk to them.

559
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,617
Yeah.

560
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:32,086
We don't hate each other.

561
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:34,055
That's a positive.

562
00:21:34,057 --> 00:21:35,990
Are you?

563
00:21:37,993 --> 00:21:39,528
Hey!

564
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,929
Hey!

565
00:21:40,931 --> 00:21:42,598
You're up.

566
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,771
You look great.

567
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:50,072
Oh, thank you.

568
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:51,540
Here, let me help you up.

569
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:53,510
Oh, merci.
How are ya?

570
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,845
Got a mouthful of hair
just then, sorry. Sorry.

571
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:58,415
Good. I prefer it.
Good.

572
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,582
Hey. Morning.

573
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:00,583
Thanks for having us.

574
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,419
Sure. My pleasure.

575
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,487
Just coming to see if I can
interest you guys in a hike,

576
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,822
a little trail hike.

577
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,591
Will it offend you at all
if I say no?

578
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:08,793
Absolutely not.

579
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:09,927
No way, then.
I'm not going.

580
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,962
If you don't mind.

581
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,531
Doesn't offend me at all.
Awesome.

582
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:16,033
Yeah, maybe... how about you?
You want to go?

583
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:18,636
I...

584
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:30,515
Probably spent the first month
trying to figure out

585
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:33,953
what was in it for her,
you know.

586
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:36,656
But I guess you have to take
a person at their word

587
00:22:36,658 --> 00:22:38,124
that...

588
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:43,062
They're actually into you,
you know?

589
00:22:43,064 --> 00:22:44,797
I don't know.

590
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,135
It's hard to figure women out.

591
00:22:48,137 --> 00:22:49,136
Well...

592
00:22:49,138 --> 00:22:50,604
Still working on it.

593
00:22:50,606 --> 00:22:52,673
I mean,
you're an interesting...

594
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:55,642
Polite gentleman.

595
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,615
I'm sure that's...

596
00:23:00,617 --> 00:23:02,817
That's a good way to put it.
I'm sure that's a big factor.

597
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:04,853
No, that's a lovely...
that's a lovely way to put it.

598
00:23:04,855 --> 00:23:06,120
Well,
I'll bet a lot of people...

599
00:23:06,122 --> 00:23:07,121
I'm probably a little...

600
00:23:07,123 --> 00:23:08,756
Interesting gentlemen

601
00:23:08,758 --> 00:23:10,592
don't necessarily come in there
all the time.

602
00:23:10,594 --> 00:23:12,694
I'm probably somewhere
on the Asperger's spectrum.

603
00:23:12,696 --> 00:23:15,431
That's probably
a little closer to it.

604
00:23:15,433 --> 00:23:16,699
All right, you ready?
Yes.

605
00:23:16,701 --> 00:23:18,200
What's your first bet?

606
00:23:18,202 --> 00:23:20,002
What's a good first bet?
$5?

607
00:23:20,004 --> 00:23:21,604
We're gonna...
way more than that.

608
00:23:21,606 --> 00:23:22,972
Let's say $100 minimum
at this table.

609
00:23:22,974 --> 00:23:23,973
This is VIP.

610
00:23:23,975 --> 00:23:25,174
I don't have $100.

611
00:23:25,176 --> 00:23:27,511
Well,
the house will give you $1,000.

612
00:23:27,513 --> 00:23:28,845
Not give you, but as a credit.

613
00:23:28,847 --> 00:23:31,081
Oh, I was like,
"I love gambling!"

614
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,682
Yeah, you just went...

615
00:23:32,684 --> 00:23:35,018
No, the house
will spot you $1,000,

616
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,520
because we know
you're good for it.

617
00:23:36,522 --> 00:23:38,121
Great.
So $100.

618
00:23:38,123 --> 00:23:39,856
Okay, I shouldn't...
$100.

619
00:23:39,858 --> 00:23:41,626
Yeah, you don't want to go
$1,000 to start.

620
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,827
You want to go more?

621
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:44,028
No, I'll start with $100.

622
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,597
Okay.
Good luck to you.

623
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,666
A nine versus a face.

624
00:23:48,668 --> 00:23:51,669
Hit me.

625
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:52,937
We got a nine and an eight.

626
00:23:52,939 --> 00:23:55,674
That's a hard 17.

627
00:23:55,676 --> 00:23:56,975
What do you say?

628
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:00,078
Hit me.
You want to hit with a 17?

629
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,580
Yeah, hit me.
That is a very bold...

630
00:24:01,582 --> 00:24:03,015
And a bust, ma'am.
That is a 23.

631
00:24:03,017 --> 00:24:04,583
We're really sorry.
You're down $100.

632
00:24:04,585 --> 00:24:05,918
That's okay.

633
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,222
I was gonna say,
I wonder sometimes,

634
00:24:09,224 --> 00:24:13,860
you know, if I'd have met
somebody like her or you

635
00:24:13,862 --> 00:24:18,197
or, you know, somebody
that had that kind of...

636
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:21,602
thing going on 15 years ago...

637
00:24:23,638 --> 00:24:24,972
Well, you know what?
I probably did.

638
00:24:24,974 --> 00:24:27,908
I probably did meet somebody
like that.

639
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,811
And I probably
wasn't paying attention.

640
00:24:39,222 --> 00:24:42,190
You have lost every hand.

641
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:44,793
You are down $1,000.

642
00:24:44,795 --> 00:24:46,261
I am yet to see my cards.

643
00:24:46,263 --> 00:24:49,765
Will the casino kindly give me
another $1,000?

644
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:51,167
I'll tell you...
I'm good for it.

645
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:52,602
Kate, I...

646
00:24:52,604 --> 00:24:53,603
This is like college.

647
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:55,538
I have never done this before,

648
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,673
but I'll talk to the pit boss.

649
00:24:57,675 --> 00:24:59,108
We'll give you another $1,000!

650
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,276
Yes! Thank you.

651
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:01,577
You better win it back, kid.

652
00:25:01,579 --> 00:25:03,680
'Cause if you lose $2,000,

653
00:25:03,682 --> 00:25:05,649
I personally
am gonna bust your legs.

654
00:25:05,651 --> 00:25:06,783
I'm all warmed up now.

655
00:25:06,785 --> 00:25:07,884
How much?

656
00:25:07,886 --> 00:25:09,219
$100.

657
00:25:09,221 --> 00:25:10,754
That low right now?

658
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:12,222
You're right.
Let's get weird.

659
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:13,890
$300?

660
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:15,325
Now we're talking.
Good luck, ma'am.

661
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:17,328
I really mean that.
I do work off tips.

662
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,163
This thing's amazing.
Where'd you get that?

663
00:25:19,165 --> 00:25:22,867
It kind of came
with my... my pack.

664
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:23,868
It's fantastic.

665
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,869
It's a little... yeah.

666
00:25:24,871 --> 00:25:26,170
It's a little dinky,

667
00:25:26,172 --> 00:25:28,106
but it's got the tarp
underneath.

668
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:30,643
Yeah, it's, like, waterproof.
So it's, like, heavy-duty.

669
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:32,011
It's perfect.
Absolutely perfect.

670
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:33,946
Yeah.

671
00:25:33,948 --> 00:25:34,947
Oh, wow.

672
00:25:34,949 --> 00:25:36,849
Okay.

673
00:25:36,851 --> 00:25:41,120
I didn't think I brought...
was glasses for the wine.

674
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,989
But we can probably
just swig out of the bottle.

675
00:25:42,991 --> 00:25:44,624
Are you cool with that?

676
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,960
No, no.
I'm happy to see this.

677
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,329
I've... I've been
kind of dreading this,

678
00:25:49,331 --> 00:25:52,198
'cause I felt
like you were so impressed

679
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,367
by my outdoorsy-ness.

680
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:55,602
Yeah?

681
00:25:55,604 --> 00:25:56,671
And, um...

682
00:25:56,673 --> 00:25:57,905
Uh, this is actually...

683
00:25:57,907 --> 00:25:59,840
Are you fucking kidding me?

684
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:01,075
Are you kidding me with that?

685
00:26:01,077 --> 00:26:02,209
I know.
It's embarrassing.

686
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:03,377
Who are you?

687
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:05,913
It's... I'm a bourgeois pig.

688
00:26:05,915 --> 00:26:07,948
That is... that is gorgeous.

689
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,383
Look at that.
Oh, my God.

690
00:26:09,385 --> 00:26:11,687
I know. It's got,
like, silverware and...

691
00:26:11,689 --> 00:26:12,721
Nah, that's great.

692
00:26:12,723 --> 00:26:14,189
It has a cheese board.

693
00:26:14,191 --> 00:26:16,024
You saved the day.
No, you just saved the day.

694
00:26:16,026 --> 00:26:17,025
That's fantastic.

695
00:26:17,027 --> 00:26:18,960
Now I'm fine.

696
00:26:18,962 --> 00:26:20,696
I love it.

697
00:26:20,698 --> 00:26:23,399
Yeah, I thought,
"I'll use this all the time."

698
00:26:23,401 --> 00:26:26,769
Jill, you're not
fucking around, are you?

699
00:26:26,771 --> 00:26:29,205
But this is actually the first
time I've gotten to use it,

700
00:26:29,207 --> 00:26:30,973
so thank you.

701
00:26:30,975 --> 00:26:33,643
I'm honored.

702
00:26:33,645 --> 00:26:34,744
All right.

703
00:26:34,746 --> 00:26:36,179
Here's to not fucking around.

704
00:26:36,181 --> 00:26:37,748
Cheers.
Cheers.

705
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,316
Can I get rid of these onions?
Is that fair?

706
00:26:39,318 --> 00:26:40,918
No, that's part of it.

707
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,686
All right, let's have
one humongous sandwich,

708
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:44,354
and we'll cut it in half.

709
00:26:44,356 --> 00:26:46,323
We won't use mayo.
That's a perfect compromise.

710
00:26:47,393 --> 00:26:49,893
This is the best sandwich ever.

711
00:26:49,895 --> 00:26:51,229
Wait.

712
00:26:51,231 --> 00:26:53,031
Can we get this disgustingness
off the top?

713
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:55,366
Yeah.

714
00:26:55,368 --> 00:26:57,202
I don't know
if I put enough mustard on.

715
00:26:57,204 --> 00:26:59,337
You have to put
a lot of mustard on.

716
00:27:01,807 --> 00:27:03,174
I feel like I might...

717
00:27:03,176 --> 00:27:04,443
may be
about to embarrass myself.

718
00:27:04,445 --> 00:27:06,746
My heart's beating really fast.

719
00:27:06,748 --> 00:27:09,281
Um...

720
00:27:09,283 --> 00:27:12,351
How come?

721
00:27:12,353 --> 00:27:14,720
Is that just me?

722
00:27:14,722 --> 00:27:16,689
Maybe that's just me.

723
00:27:16,691 --> 00:27:18,024
Sorry.

724
00:27:20,862 --> 00:27:22,462
How come?

725
00:27:22,464 --> 00:27:23,764
What's going on?

726
00:27:23,766 --> 00:27:25,165
Um...

727
00:27:28,302 --> 00:27:30,838
No, I just had, like,
a nervous feeling.

728
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,208
Um, but that just might be...

729
00:27:35,344 --> 00:27:38,012
That just might be all me.

730
00:27:49,225 --> 00:27:50,859
Oh, no, don't do that.

731
00:27:50,861 --> 00:27:52,294
Don't do that.

732
00:27:54,865 --> 00:27:56,398
We're even.

733
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,432
Yeah, all right.

734
00:27:57,434 --> 00:27:59,169
We're even.
Okay.

735
00:27:59,171 --> 00:28:01,838
Allow the moment to be even.

736
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,139
You don't say soy cheese.

737
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:04,374
I don't say mayo.

738
00:28:04,376 --> 00:28:06,476
We're adults.

739
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:07,977
Oh, you are the worst.

740
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:09,279
Luckily I caught it.

741
00:28:10,782 --> 00:28:11,782
Look at you.

742
00:28:11,784 --> 00:28:13,050
You're a pirate.

743
00:28:50,157 --> 00:28:52,159
That help?

744
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:05,406
Okay, go!

745
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,610
Oh!

746
00:29:15,985 --> 00:29:16,985
Ah, fuck.

747
00:29:16,987 --> 00:29:17,986
Here.
Okay.

748
00:29:17,988 --> 00:29:19,555
10:00.

749
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:20,923
Oh.

750
00:29:27,397 --> 00:29:28,964
You broke my finger.

751
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,605
Don't even think about it!

752
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,908
Come on!

753
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:47,218
Hey, doing okay?

754
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,020
Mm-hmm. You?

755
00:29:49,022 --> 00:29:50,655
Good.

756
00:30:34,302 --> 00:30:36,270
Oh.
Let me give you this.

757
00:30:36,272 --> 00:30:39,373
Oh, thanks.

758
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:41,977
You don't...
I don't need it if...

759
00:30:41,979 --> 00:30:43,979
No, it's fine, I made a...

760
00:30:43,981 --> 00:30:45,013
It's fine.

761
00:30:45,015 --> 00:30:46,481
Yeah.

762
00:30:55,092 --> 00:30:57,426
Are you gonna do that
the whole time?

763
00:30:57,428 --> 00:30:59,128
I might, yeah.

764
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,629
I might.

765
00:31:00,631 --> 00:31:02,465
I want to see where you are.

766
00:31:02,467 --> 00:31:03,466
Good part.

767
00:31:03,468 --> 00:31:04,467
Do you like it?

768
00:31:04,469 --> 00:31:06,402
I do.

769
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,657
Remember, jacks and jokers.

770
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:29,994
Okay.

771
00:31:29,996 --> 00:31:31,329
No!

772
00:31:31,331 --> 00:31:32,597
'Cause if you hit accidentally,

773
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,965
you have to get punished for it.

774
00:31:33,967 --> 00:31:34,967
No!

775
00:31:34,969 --> 00:31:36,702
Ah, damn it. Oh, fuck!

776
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,203
That's a seven!

777
00:31:38,205 --> 00:31:40,272
All right,
so you get all those,

778
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:41,273
and I get punished.

779
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:43,108
I decide.

780
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,276
That's right.

781
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:46,045
When we started,
you said seven.

782
00:31:46,047 --> 00:31:47,747
Faster, faster, faster.

783
00:31:47,749 --> 00:31:51,317
Faster, faster. Faster!

784
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,752
Ah!

785
00:31:55,223 --> 00:31:56,523
Which one do you want to do?

786
00:31:56,525 --> 00:31:58,224
You want to deal,
or you want to slap?

787
00:31:58,226 --> 00:31:59,225
I want you to deal.

788
00:31:59,227 --> 00:32:00,226
No, I want you to deal.

789
00:32:00,228 --> 00:32:01,562
Okay.

790
00:32:01,564 --> 00:32:03,431
Five seconds on the deal.

791
00:32:03,433 --> 00:32:04,598
I'll do the first three.

792
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,599
You do the last one.

793
00:32:05,601 --> 00:32:06,600
Okay, okay, okay.

794
00:32:06,602 --> 00:32:07,701
Okay, ready?

795
00:32:07,703 --> 00:32:08,702
Do you feel good?

796
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,539
Yeah, I'm ready.

797
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:13,040
So is that what you choose
to do?

798
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:14,375
Yes.
Then do this for the cameras.

799
00:32:14,377 --> 00:32:16,011
Oh.

800
00:32:16,013 --> 00:32:17,479
There's a camera above us
at all times,

801
00:32:17,481 --> 00:32:19,614
so you go like this,
and if you want to... okay.

802
00:32:19,616 --> 00:32:21,616
If you want to hit,
you go like this.

803
00:32:21,618 --> 00:32:23,385
And then you clear your hands

804
00:32:23,387 --> 00:32:24,653
to make sure
you're not stealing chips.

805
00:32:24,655 --> 00:32:26,655
Shouldn't you hit on the 14?

806
00:32:26,657 --> 00:32:28,724
No, 'cause you have
to think about what I'm playing.

807
00:32:28,726 --> 00:32:30,259
Not against a three.
Okay.

808
00:32:30,261 --> 00:32:31,727
So what would you like to do,
ma'am?

809
00:32:31,729 --> 00:32:33,563
I'll stay.
That's a very smart stay.

810
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:35,131
That's a bad card for you.

811
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:36,432
Now I have an eight.

812
00:32:36,434 --> 00:32:38,267
Now I have an 11.

813
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:39,602
Now I have an 18.

814
00:32:39,604 --> 00:32:42,272
You lost that hand, that's...
hey!

815
00:32:42,274 --> 00:32:43,273
Are we being...
Sorry.

816
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:44,475
Are we being way too loud?

817
00:32:44,477 --> 00:32:46,777
No, no.
No, you guys are fine.

818
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:48,445
I was just coming to hang out.

819
00:32:48,447 --> 00:32:50,180
Are you saying
we're totally fine,

820
00:32:50,182 --> 00:32:51,515
but we're being way too loud?

821
00:32:51,517 --> 00:32:52,549
No, no, he's asleep.

822
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:53,584
He got me drunk...

823
00:32:53,586 --> 00:32:54,585
Oh.
I'm sorry.

824
00:32:54,587 --> 00:32:56,287
And I lost so badly.

825
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:58,089
And she's a total lightweight.
Here, drink this.

826
00:32:58,091 --> 00:32:59,491
And then he was beating me up.

827
00:32:59,493 --> 00:33:00,825
Are you drinking or...
I'll get my own.

828
00:33:00,827 --> 00:33:02,560
Deal.

829
00:33:02,562 --> 00:33:04,429
Okay, you're up $100.
What would you like to do?

830
00:33:04,431 --> 00:33:06,564
Do you guys need anything?
Yeah, let's have another.

831
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:08,099
Let's just get a couple
on the table.

832
00:33:08,101 --> 00:33:09,168
Okay.

833
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,302
Okay, so you lost that hand.

834
00:33:10,304 --> 00:33:11,303
You're down 100 bucks.

835
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:12,538
She saw me lose.

836
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,173
It's fine.
Okay.

837
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:16,475
She lost
a lot of money earlier.

838
00:33:20,547 --> 00:33:24,217
All right.

839
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:27,154
Why are you so good
at blackjack?

840
00:33:27,156 --> 00:33:28,755
'Cause when I was younger,

841
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:31,791
I used to work on
the riverboats in the casinos.

842
00:33:31,793 --> 00:33:33,426
What?

843
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,428
Yeah, my family,
we all played cards growing up.

844
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,166
So when I was, like,
19 or 20 or whatever,

845
00:33:38,168 --> 00:33:39,867
my buddy got me a job,
or an interview,

846
00:33:39,869 --> 00:33:41,502
with this Chinese guy

847
00:33:41,504 --> 00:33:44,105
who ran a company
called "Network Management."

848
00:33:45,408 --> 00:33:47,475
Which is just, like,
a fake company.

849
00:33:47,477 --> 00:33:48,476
And then I got the job.

850
00:33:48,478 --> 00:33:50,145
It was an hourly wage.

851
00:33:50,147 --> 00:33:52,147
And he sent me on the boats
with 10,000 bucks

852
00:33:52,149 --> 00:33:53,882
for eight-hour shifts.

853
00:33:53,884 --> 00:33:57,119
I just played, you know,
with the company's money.

854
00:33:57,121 --> 00:33:59,354
So I was just a worker,

855
00:33:59,356 --> 00:34:01,790
but my game was,
you know, cards.

856
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:04,827
That's crazy.
Yeah.

857
00:34:04,829 --> 00:34:06,496
Should we go have a smoke?

858
00:34:06,498 --> 00:34:08,598
You want to sit outside?
Okay.

859
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,900
You want to?
Yeah.

860
00:34:10,902 --> 00:34:13,269
I don't want to wake her up.

861
00:34:22,547 --> 00:34:24,448
Here, I'll grab that.

862
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:25,883
That's the problem
with heartbreak,

863
00:34:25,885 --> 00:34:27,818
is that to you,
it's like an atomic bomb,

864
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,422
and to the world,
it's just really cliché,

865
00:34:30,424 --> 00:34:32,490
because, in the end,
we all have the same experience.

866
00:34:32,492 --> 00:34:34,926
But it's just you and me.

867
00:34:34,928 --> 00:34:38,463
I was madly,
madly in love with him,

868
00:34:38,465 --> 00:34:42,467
and we were total soul mates
and totally in love.

869
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:46,539
And then he said,

870
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:50,776
"I think maybe
we should just not."

871
00:34:50,778 --> 00:34:54,313
I think he said something
along the lines of,

872
00:34:54,315 --> 00:34:55,681
"I think we should, uh"...

873
00:34:55,683 --> 00:34:57,317
and he's not, like,
a football player,

874
00:34:57,319 --> 00:34:59,286
so this is a weird thing
for him to say...

875
00:34:59,288 --> 00:35:01,855
"I think we should take a knee
on this romance stuff."

876
00:35:01,857 --> 00:35:03,423
What does that mean?
That's so lame.

877
00:35:03,425 --> 00:35:04,925
I actually had to ask somebody.

878
00:35:04,927 --> 00:35:07,261
I was like,
"Is 'take a knee' a good thing?"

879
00:35:07,263 --> 00:35:08,262
No.

880
00:35:08,264 --> 00:35:09,596
No.
No.

881
00:35:09,598 --> 00:35:11,599
You've obviously
got a lot of love,

882
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:12,967
so that's there.

883
00:35:12,969 --> 00:35:15,403
Some people don't.
Some people are snakes.

884
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,605
And you're fun.

885
00:35:17,607 --> 00:35:19,807
And if Chris is lucky...

886
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,777
You know, you have babies

887
00:35:22,779 --> 00:35:24,513
and do all that good stuff

888
00:35:24,515 --> 00:35:29,285
and live in this house
or a house equivalent to this.

889
00:35:29,287 --> 00:35:32,421
Yeah, you guys could come over
and play bridge.

890
00:35:32,423 --> 00:35:33,422
Fuckin' pass.

891
00:35:35,226 --> 00:35:37,259
By the way, I'm not doing
more double dates, either.

892
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:38,561
This was fun.

893
00:35:38,563 --> 00:35:39,696
You love it.

894
00:35:39,698 --> 00:35:42,699
No, I'm having a good time.

895
00:35:42,701 --> 00:35:44,868
You know what I want to do,
Kate?

896
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,969
Mm?

897
00:35:45,971 --> 00:35:47,003
If you don't want to do it,

898
00:35:47,005 --> 00:35:50,307
this is your chance to get out.

899
00:35:50,309 --> 00:35:51,475
Okay.

900
00:35:51,477 --> 00:35:53,978
I want to make a huge fire.

901
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,446
I'm good at making fires.

902
00:35:55,448 --> 00:35:57,548
I can do it.

903
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:00,851
And we'll sit by the fire
and relax on the beach.

904
00:36:00,853 --> 00:36:03,954
And fall asleep
on the fucking sand.

905
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:05,891
And if we don't fall asleep...

906
00:36:05,893 --> 00:36:07,993
because there's a good chance
it's too uncomfortable

907
00:36:07,995 --> 00:36:09,728
to fall asleep...

908
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:10,962
we'll put the fire out,
and we'll go to bed.

909
00:36:10,964 --> 00:36:12,364
Okay.

910
00:36:12,366 --> 00:36:13,432
Do you want to do that?
Yes.

911
00:36:13,434 --> 00:36:14,700
Does that sound fun to you?

912
00:36:14,702 --> 00:36:16,468
Yes.
Are you just saying that?

913
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,736
Do you really think
it sounds fun?

914
00:36:17,738 --> 00:36:18,871
I think it sounds really fun.

915
00:36:18,873 --> 00:36:20,340
Are you just saying that,

916
00:36:20,342 --> 00:36:22,008
or do you really think
it sounds fun?

917
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,477
I think it sounds really fun.
Okay, then we'll do that.

918
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:26,646
What about
if we don't fall asleep

919
00:36:26,648 --> 00:36:27,814
and we stay up all night?

920
00:36:27,816 --> 00:36:29,982
Are you okay with that?

921
00:36:29,984 --> 00:36:34,021
Yeah, I think that's only,
like, four hours away anyway.

922
00:36:34,023 --> 00:36:35,022
That's fine.

923
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:36,824
That's pretty great.

924
00:36:36,826 --> 00:36:38,726
That's pretty great.
That's pretty great.

925
00:36:48,904 --> 00:36:51,072
I have an idea.

926
00:36:51,074 --> 00:36:53,441
Let's go swimming.

927
00:36:53,443 --> 00:36:54,976
Why not?

928
00:36:54,978 --> 00:36:57,712
'Cause it's 2:00 or 3:00
in the morning.

929
00:36:57,714 --> 00:37:00,082
We got a great fire
and a six pack of beer.

930
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:04,320
So we can go into the water
and come back and get warm.

931
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,322
Let's go.
I'm gonna go in.

932
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,489
Don't.

933
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:07,890
I'm gonna go in.
Don't!

934
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,625
Why not?
Kate, just don't do this.

935
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,594
Why not?
No, don't go in the water.

936
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:13,463
Why not?

937
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:14,464
Last chance.

938
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:15,699
Kate, stop it.

939
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:17,401
Last chance.

940
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:19,436
Come swimming with me.

941
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:22,939
Come on! Please?

942
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:30,081

I just got one.

I could... this is us.

955
00:38:38,156 --> 00:38:39,655
I got it.

956
00:38:39,657 --> 00:38:42,024
Oh, jeez, it's a hassle.

957
00:38:42,026 --> 00:38:43,025
You got it?

958
00:38:43,027 --> 00:38:44,861
Yeah, I got it.

959
00:38:44,863 --> 00:38:47,431
Hey, listen, if you guys ever
need anything, give me a call.

960
00:38:47,433 --> 00:38:50,067
Really fun.
Yeah. So fun.

961
00:38:50,069 --> 00:38:51,168
Thank you.

962
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,870
Thank you.
So much.

963
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:53,871
So great.

964
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,439
Sleep well, guys.

965
00:38:55,441 --> 00:38:56,607
See you later.

966
00:38:56,609 --> 00:38:57,608
You have keys?

967
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:58,809
Yes.

968
00:39:01,914 --> 00:39:02,947
Hey.

969
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:04,215
Do you want me to drive?

970
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:07,852
No,
I kind of need to talk to you.

971
00:39:07,854 --> 00:39:09,621
Um...

972
00:39:09,623 --> 00:39:12,790
Do you want to go...
is there some place...

973
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:14,226
Where do you want to go?

974
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:16,228
Home.
Can we just go home?

975
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,698
I'm really tired. I'm...

976
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,167
Yeah, okay. All right.

977
00:39:22,169 --> 00:39:24,870
Maybe we'll just drive a bit.

978
00:40:04,113 --> 00:40:05,948
All right, I hope you pussies

979
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,251
are up
for some drinking tonight!

980
00:40:08,253 --> 00:40:10,019
Look at this entrance.

981
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:13,723
No one's going home
to their significant other,

982
00:40:13,725 --> 00:40:15,692
because I no longer have one.

983
00:40:15,694 --> 00:40:17,594
That's right!

984
00:40:17,596 --> 00:40:20,763
The shackles are off.

985
00:40:20,765 --> 00:40:21,966
I'm free.

986
00:40:21,968 --> 00:40:22,967
Thank you.
Thank you.

987
00:40:24,637 --> 00:40:26,804
Thank you.
Thank you.

988
00:40:26,806 --> 00:40:29,573
So anyway,
get yourselves prepared.

989
00:40:29,575 --> 00:40:30,574
Do what you need to do.

990
00:40:30,576 --> 00:40:32,610
Cancel on your wives,

991
00:40:32,612 --> 00:40:34,980
and, um,
I'll see you pussies tonight.

992
00:40:34,982 --> 00:40:36,047
Okay.

993
00:40:36,049 --> 00:40:37,115
All right?
Yeah.

994
00:40:37,117 --> 00:40:38,350
Bye.

995
00:40:42,622 --> 00:40:44,289
Sorry.

996
00:40:45,592 --> 00:40:46,591
Hey.

997
00:40:46,593 --> 00:40:47,726
What?

998
00:40:47,728 --> 00:40:48,728
For you.
Is that for me?

999
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:49,729
Yes, the candle fell in.

1000
00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:50,730
Thanks, Gene.

1001
00:40:50,732 --> 00:40:51,931
Cheers.
Cheers.

1002
00:40:51,933 --> 00:40:53,199
Thanks, guys.
To your new life.

1003
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,233
To your freedom.

1004
00:40:54,235 --> 00:40:55,768
Yes.

1005
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,169
It's a personality thing.

1006
00:40:57,171 --> 00:40:59,705
I would advise someone
in a reverse situation

1007
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:00,973
to give you more...

1008
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:02,209
Oh-oh, got 'em.
Got 'em.

1009
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:03,210
Two shots of Malort.

1010
00:41:03,212 --> 00:41:04,611
Uh, no.

1011
00:41:04,613 --> 00:41:05,846
Right from the basement.
Go on.

1012
00:41:05,848 --> 00:41:07,648
I'm not drinking the Malort.

1013
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,182
You're gonna have to.
It's a Chicago tradition.

1014
00:41:09,184 --> 00:41:10,884
You're single.
This'll erase all past mistakes.

1015
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:12,052
I'm single!

1016
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:13,320
It does?
Makes room for new ones.

1017
00:41:13,322 --> 00:41:15,122
Oh, my God!
Here we go.

1018
00:41:15,124 --> 00:41:17,792
It's like swallowing
a burnt condom full of gas.

1019
00:41:17,794 --> 00:41:20,194
Ah!

1020
00:41:20,196 --> 00:41:21,796
Ugh.

1021
00:41:21,798 --> 00:41:25,233
Look at that weird form.

1022
00:41:25,235 --> 00:41:26,901
Well, it's this damn heater,
you know?

1023
00:41:26,903 --> 00:41:28,369
I don't know.

1024
00:41:32,142 --> 00:41:33,375
Uh-oh.

1025
00:41:33,377 --> 00:41:34,376
There she is.

1026
00:41:34,378 --> 00:41:35,377
Up top.

1027
00:41:35,379 --> 00:41:37,680
Hey!
Aw.

1028
00:41:37,682 --> 00:41:39,948
Thanks.

1029
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,216
You okay?

1030
00:41:41,218 --> 00:41:43,319
Yeah. Yeah.

1031
00:41:43,321 --> 00:41:44,320
Yeah.
Crazy.

1032
00:41:44,322 --> 00:41:45,321
No, it's good, though.

1033
00:41:45,323 --> 00:41:46,856
You sure?

1034
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:48,158
Yeah. It's... I'm young,
you know?

1035
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,659
Of course you're young.

1036
00:41:49,661 --> 00:41:51,061
Don't hold me down.
No, yeah.

1037
00:41:51,063 --> 00:41:52,128
Can't hold me back.

1038
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,396
Hey, come outside with me.

1039
00:41:53,398 --> 00:41:54,864
Let's have a cigarette
and talk.

1040
00:41:54,866 --> 00:41:55,933
No.
I'm gonna see you inside.

1041
00:41:55,935 --> 00:41:57,635
I'm gonna play games.

1042
00:41:57,637 --> 00:41:59,036
Hey, get out here.
Let's have one cigarette.

1043
00:41:59,038 --> 00:42:00,337
No!
I want to hear what happened.

1044
00:42:00,339 --> 00:42:02,273
Come back soon.

1045
00:42:07,345 --> 00:42:09,346
You're the prettiest girl
at work.

1046
00:42:09,348 --> 00:42:11,149
I'm the only girl at work.

1047
00:42:11,151 --> 00:42:13,685
Still.
You still are the prettiest.

1048
00:42:13,687 --> 00:42:15,253
You could have been
the ugliest girl at work

1049
00:42:15,255 --> 00:42:16,421
and still been the only one.

1050
00:42:16,423 --> 00:42:18,123
You're not.
True, true.

1051
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:19,357
I've been ten minutes out
since I got here.

1052
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,826
I had one of these,
and then I said,

1053
00:42:20,828 --> 00:42:21,960
"I'm gonna have one of those,"

1054
00:42:21,962 --> 00:42:23,362
and then here I am.

1055
00:42:23,364 --> 00:42:25,665
Yeah, it's hard
once it starts going in.

1056
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:26,666
I don't know what I am.

1057
00:42:26,668 --> 00:42:28,234
Four or five in?

1058
00:42:28,236 --> 00:42:29,702
You're five in?

1059
00:42:29,704 --> 00:42:31,137
I might've.
Oh.

1060
00:42:31,139 --> 00:42:33,439
But I had a turkey burger
earlier, so...

1061
00:42:33,441 --> 00:42:35,675
You're really
keeping it together.

1062
00:42:35,677 --> 00:42:38,412
Yeah, I'm a quiet drunk.

1063
00:42:38,414 --> 00:42:39,913
You're right!

1064
00:42:39,915 --> 00:42:40,914
Oh, my God!

1065
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:42,783
I know.
What?

1066
00:42:42,785 --> 00:42:44,918
Let it sink in, 'cause
I've been thinking about it for,

1067
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,453
like, an hour and a half.

1068
00:42:46,455 --> 00:42:48,188
It's really our bottom half.
That's right.

1069
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,323
Top half, I win for sure.

1070
00:42:49,325 --> 00:42:51,860
Yeah. I'm gonna leave.

1071
00:42:51,862 --> 00:42:54,062
I like how wear...
we are, right?

1072
00:42:54,064 --> 00:42:55,063
The same everything.

1073
00:42:55,065 --> 00:42:56,397
Guys? I'm gonna go.

1074
00:42:56,399 --> 00:42:58,099
Gene, good night.
Always a pleasure.

1075
00:42:58,101 --> 00:42:59,934
Hey, good night.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

1076
00:42:59,936 --> 00:43:00,935
See you tomorrow.

1077
00:43:00,937 --> 00:43:03,071
Bye, Gene.

1078
00:43:03,073 --> 00:43:06,475
And he wears it every time
we all get together.

1079
00:43:06,477 --> 00:43:08,878
No, 'cause
it's a conversation starter!

1080
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,479
We wouldn't have jobs
if it wasn't for Gene.

1081
00:43:10,481 --> 00:43:12,181
I respect Gene.

1082
00:43:12,183 --> 00:43:14,483
I respect Gene,
and I respect your jean choice.

1083
00:43:14,485 --> 00:43:16,118
Because they're the same
as mine.

1084
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,021
Yeah, because
they're the same as yours.

1085
00:43:18,023 --> 00:43:19,456
Yeah. It's cool.

1086
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:21,091
Hey, I'm gonna take off.
Want a ride?

1087
00:43:21,093 --> 00:43:23,160
Luke. Luke. Luke.
Luke, look at our legs.

1088
00:43:23,162 --> 00:43:25,028
Look at all how...

1089
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,163
It looks like the same person!

1090
00:43:26,165 --> 00:43:27,397
She's melted.

1091
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:28,799
She's melting in her shoes.

1092
00:43:28,801 --> 00:43:30,267
Yeah, we wear the same clothes!

1093
00:43:30,269 --> 00:43:31,836
Would you like a ride home?
I'm gonna go.

1094
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:32,937
I'm happy
to put your bike in my car.

1095
00:43:32,939 --> 00:43:34,372
No, you can't go.

1096
00:43:34,374 --> 00:43:35,973
I'm gonna give you a ride.
Let's go.

1097
00:43:35,975 --> 00:43:37,308
Lock the doors.
Come on. Let's go.

1098
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:38,943
Why? No, come on.

1099
00:43:38,945 --> 00:43:40,211
She's good, man.
She's good.

1100
00:43:40,213 --> 00:43:42,246
I'm not talking to you, dude.

1101
00:43:42,248 --> 00:43:44,349
But you know she's good.
She's fine. She'll get home.

1102
00:43:44,351 --> 00:43:45,350
Luke...

1103
00:43:45,352 --> 00:43:47,886
Stay.

1104
00:43:47,888 --> 00:43:49,955
Does he say that in Star Wars?

1105
00:43:50,991 --> 00:43:52,925
Kate, you want a ride home?

1106
00:43:52,927 --> 00:43:53,959
Nah, I'm good.

1107
00:43:53,961 --> 00:43:55,093
Okay.

1108
00:43:56,896 --> 00:43:59,465
Boo.

1109
00:43:59,467 --> 00:44:02,335
But wait,
I need to take a photo.

1110
00:44:02,337 --> 00:44:03,937
Instagram?
You gonna Instagram it?

1111
00:44:03,939 --> 00:44:05,138
I'm gonna mentally Instagram.

1112
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,239
Okay.

1113
00:44:06,241 --> 00:44:08,041
In the future, you can do that.

1114
00:44:08,043 --> 00:44:10,310
That's true.

1115
00:44:10,312 --> 00:44:11,478
You home?

1116
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,780
Hey.

1117
00:44:12,782 --> 00:44:13,981
Hey, where are ya?

1118
00:44:13,983 --> 00:44:15,216
I'm in here.

1119
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,420
Hey, baby.

1120
00:44:19,422 --> 00:44:21,188
Hey.

1121
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:25,894
What are you doing?

1122
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:27,529
Just working.

1123
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:30,932
Can you bring me home
a shipping crate from work?

1124
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:33,235
I was gonna put it on its side,

1125
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:35,303
then put this in,
and then, like, mount it...

1126
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:36,938
Sure.
On the wall.

1127
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,407
That's easy enough.
How many you want?

1128
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,543
Just one.

1129
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:42,078
Okay.
I'm gonna get a beer.

1130
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,412
You want anything
from the kitchen?

1131
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:44,413
No, thank you.

1132
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,414
Nothing?

1133
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:46,415
I'm okay.
Okay.

1134
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,416
Thank you, baby.

1135
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:49,018
Okay.

1136
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,527
Hey, you want to hear
something crazy?

1137
00:44:57,529 --> 00:44:59,596
Yeah.

1138
00:44:59,598 --> 00:45:04,001
Um, Kate broke up with Chris.

1139
00:45:09,008 --> 00:45:12,410
Yeah,
broke his heart or something.

1140
00:45:12,412 --> 00:45:14,345
What, today?

1141
00:45:14,347 --> 00:45:15,880
All... I don't know.

1142
00:45:15,882 --> 00:45:17,949
I think last night
or early this morning.

1143
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,985
I mean, she literally
walked in this morning...

1144
00:45:19,987 --> 00:45:21,520
you know,
you know how much I like Kate,

1145
00:45:21,522 --> 00:45:23,355
but it's the thing about her
that's annoying,

1146
00:45:23,357 --> 00:45:25,124
where you're like...

1147
00:45:25,126 --> 00:45:27,860
You know, she came in, literally
going like, "I'm free!"

1148
00:45:27,862 --> 00:45:30,329
That's why everybody
went out drinking tonight.

1149
00:45:30,331 --> 00:45:32,999
She had, like, a party tonight

1150
00:45:33,001 --> 00:45:34,634
about being free from Chris.

1151
00:45:34,636 --> 00:45:36,002
And I like Chris.

1152
00:45:36,004 --> 00:45:38,571
Yeah.

1153
00:45:38,573 --> 00:45:39,572
Who knows.

1154
00:45:39,574 --> 00:45:40,974
Um...

1155
00:45:40,976 --> 00:45:42,008
Do you mind if I go watch TV?

1156
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:43,410
I feel, like, emotionally...

1157
00:45:43,412 --> 00:45:45,145
No, that's fine.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1158
00:45:45,147 --> 00:45:46,147
Do you care?

1159
00:45:46,149 --> 00:45:47,315
No, I'm just gonna...

1160
00:45:47,317 --> 00:45:48,916
Keep doing this?
Mm-hmm.

1161
00:45:48,918 --> 00:45:51,619
You want to go to bed
in, like, 45 minutes?

1162
00:45:51,621 --> 00:45:52,620
Okay.

1163
00:45:52,622 --> 00:45:54,355
Good.

1164
00:46:18,215 --> 00:46:19,215
Hey, babe?

1165
00:46:19,217 --> 00:46:20,583
Did I tell you,

1166
00:46:20,585 --> 00:46:22,652
I think I might actually go
to Costa Rica?

1167
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:25,154
No, you didn't.

1168
00:46:25,156 --> 00:46:26,490
Yeah.

1169
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,925
I thought
you didn't want to go.

1170
00:46:27,927 --> 00:46:30,160
No, I didn't.

1171
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:33,998
Yeah, I just thought it was
gonna be kind of like a bummer,

1172
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,133
like, trying
to re-create college,

1173
00:46:36,135 --> 00:46:40,105
but I was, like,
texting with Kelly,

1174
00:46:40,107 --> 00:46:42,140
and the more
I thought about it,

1175
00:46:42,142 --> 00:46:44,642
I just, like... I think
I'll be sad if I don't go.

1176
00:46:44,644 --> 00:46:46,611
Fun.
How long are you gonna go?

1177
00:46:46,613 --> 00:46:47,946
Just, like, a week.

1178
00:46:47,948 --> 00:46:50,248
Wow.
Is that okay?

1179
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,017
Yeah, I just thought
you didn't want to go.

1180
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:53,986
Okay.

1181
00:46:53,988 --> 00:46:55,988
But I'm not, like,
putting you out?

1182
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:58,391
No.
Okay.

1183
00:47:01,128 --> 00:47:03,229
Hey, babe, um...

1184
00:47:04,564 --> 00:47:06,232
Can I bring something up?

1185
00:47:08,002 --> 00:47:09,603
But you have to promise
not to get mad.

1186
00:47:09,605 --> 00:47:12,472
Jill, are you kidding me?

1187
00:47:14,108 --> 00:47:15,675
Uh...

1188
00:47:15,677 --> 00:47:17,044
No, it's not... it's not bad.

1189
00:47:17,046 --> 00:47:18,178
Okay, what?
It's not... no.

1190
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,212
I just feel like...

1191
00:47:19,214 --> 00:47:22,150
Please.

1192
00:47:22,152 --> 00:47:23,484
Okay.

1193
00:47:25,988 --> 00:47:29,557
If we want to get married...

1194
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:31,125
Which we do.

1195
00:47:31,127 --> 00:47:35,297
Uh, I think...

1196
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:36,765
it is in our best interest

1197
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:40,369
to reopen that...

1198
00:47:40,371 --> 00:47:42,337
Continue having
great relationship.

1199
00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:44,506
I just, uh...

1200
00:47:44,508 --> 00:47:46,642
I would love to reopen the floor
for that conversation.

1201
00:47:46,644 --> 00:47:48,178
Absolutely.

1202
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,612
I think the last time
we talked about it

1203
00:47:49,614 --> 00:47:51,714
is where we still kind of
stand... at least for me...

1204
00:47:51,716 --> 00:47:53,149
that we are gonna get married.

1205
00:47:53,151 --> 00:47:54,584
We just have to find
the right time

1206
00:47:54,586 --> 00:47:56,419
when we're not
as slammed to figure it all out.

1207
00:47:56,421 --> 00:47:58,221
Yeah.

1208
00:47:58,223 --> 00:48:00,223
'Cause figuring it out's
kind of the boring part.

1209
00:48:00,225 --> 00:48:01,725
Totally. Um...

1210
00:48:01,727 --> 00:48:04,228
Yeah, figuring it out
is the boring part.

1211
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:06,397
Um...

1212
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:10,634
No, I just don't want to, like,
be that couple that's like,

1213
00:48:10,636 --> 00:48:14,639
"Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we're getting married."

1214
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,308
Uh, yeah.

1215
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:20,345
I just would like to have
a conversation about it.

1216
00:48:20,347 --> 00:48:21,680
Okay.

1217
00:48:21,682 --> 00:48:23,315
We don't have to do it
right now.

1218
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,316
Great. Great.

1219
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,717
All right.

1220
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:27,552
Can we not do... honestly,
I feel brain-dead.

1221
00:48:27,554 --> 00:48:29,789
No, no, no, it's...
I'm tired.

1222
00:48:29,791 --> 00:48:32,158
But I do feel the same way
that I feel.

1223
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,194
Like, you know where I'm at.

1224
00:48:35,196 --> 00:48:36,796
Okay.
Do you know where I'm at?

1225
00:48:36,798 --> 00:48:39,132
Yeah, but I feel...
but what I'm saying is,

1226
00:48:39,134 --> 00:48:40,366
that I think that...

1227
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,571
If it just feels like
it's gonna happen...

1228
00:48:44,573 --> 00:48:45,839
Right.

1229
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:47,341
We're never gonna
actually do it.

1230
00:48:47,343 --> 00:48:48,342
Right.

1231
00:48:48,344 --> 00:48:50,110
Um, look at that.

1232
00:48:50,112 --> 00:48:51,512
That was...
Look at that.

1233
00:48:51,514 --> 00:48:52,746
That's it.
That's everything.

1234
00:48:52,748 --> 00:48:53,847
That's the whole convo.

1235
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:55,150
Are you upset with me at all?

1236
00:48:55,152 --> 00:48:56,384
Be honest.

1237
00:48:56,386 --> 00:48:57,552
No.
Okay.

1238
00:48:57,554 --> 00:48:58,820
Are you upset with me?
Like, I...

1239
00:48:58,822 --> 00:49:00,522
No.
I don't want to be the...

1240
00:49:00,524 --> 00:49:03,191
And I do want to get married,
and I do want to do it.

1241
00:49:03,193 --> 00:49:05,293
It's just... I feel like
there's gonna be the right time

1242
00:49:05,295 --> 00:49:07,095
to get into it,

1243
00:49:07,097 --> 00:49:08,597
'cause it's gonna be
so much planning and work.

1244
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:10,332
It is.
You're right.

1245
00:49:10,334 --> 00:49:14,603
And I think the right moment
will present itself...

1246
00:49:14,605 --> 00:49:16,672
if we continue to have these
talks to get us there.

1247
00:49:16,674 --> 00:49:18,841
Awesome. Awesome.

1248
00:49:18,843 --> 00:49:20,109
Good?

1249
00:49:20,111 --> 00:49:21,710
We're so connected.

1250
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:23,747
I feel like
you're reading my mind.

1251
00:49:23,749 --> 00:49:25,248
Really?
How connected are we?

1252
00:49:27,252 --> 00:49:29,119
She's not wasting any time.

1253
00:49:29,121 --> 00:49:30,654
Yeah, well...

1254
00:49:30,656 --> 00:49:32,756
I'm kind of... I feel bad
that I know, to be honest.

1255
00:49:32,758 --> 00:49:34,224
Really?

1256
00:49:34,226 --> 00:49:35,459
What's up, boys?
A little bit.

1257
00:49:35,461 --> 00:49:36,460
Morning.

1258
00:49:36,462 --> 00:49:37,461
You guys get after it?

1259
00:49:37,463 --> 00:49:38,629
How you doing?

1260
00:49:38,631 --> 00:49:39,864
Good.
How late did you guys get?

1261
00:49:39,866 --> 00:49:41,365
Not late enough, apparently.

1262
00:49:41,367 --> 00:49:42,633
Yeah, yeah, right.

1263
00:49:42,635 --> 00:49:44,302
You want to go in on a plaque?

1264
00:49:44,304 --> 00:49:46,170
Not particularly.
Do I have to?

1265
00:49:46,172 --> 00:49:47,505
Yeah,
we're getting Dave a plaque.

1266
00:49:47,507 --> 00:49:48,739
Yeah.

1267
00:49:48,741 --> 00:49:50,842
You know Ryan at the bar?
Yeah.

1268
00:49:50,844 --> 00:49:52,411
Dave went home with Kate
last night.

1269
00:49:52,413 --> 00:49:53,745
They were making out
on the street.

1270
00:49:53,747 --> 00:49:55,581
That's bullshit.

1271
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:57,683
Making out in the street.
Before they got in the cab.

1272
00:49:57,685 --> 00:49:59,451
You guys saw it?
Not just splitting a cab.

1273
00:49:59,453 --> 00:50:00,452
Ryan saw it.
Ryan.

1274
00:50:00,454 --> 00:50:02,154
Ryan saw it.

1275
00:50:02,156 --> 00:50:04,224
If you can't trust him,
who can you trust, right?

1276
00:50:04,226 --> 00:50:05,291
Kind of sucks.

1277
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,292
Yeah.
Here's Dave.

1278
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:07,627
We can find out from the source.

1279
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,195
I kind of feel,
like, bad that I know,

1280
00:50:09,197 --> 00:50:10,563
because
how's she gonna walk in here?

1281
00:50:10,565 --> 00:50:11,898
Yeah, totally.
That's crazy, man.

1282
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,399
I wouldn't put
those two together.

1283
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:14,400
No, me neither.

1284
00:50:14,402 --> 00:50:15,501
If I had to draw lines...

1285
00:50:15,503 --> 00:50:16,870
No, never.
Yeah, man.

1286
00:50:16,872 --> 00:50:19,707
Everybody knows.
The whole brewery knows.

1287
00:50:19,709 --> 00:50:21,408
I'm not getting into this
with you guys.

1288
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:22,743
Hey, come on, man.

1289
00:50:22,745 --> 00:50:24,778
Everybody...
Ryan told everybody.

1290
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,248
Ryan saw you.

1291
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,449
So what?

1292
00:50:28,451 --> 00:50:30,218
Yeah, I'm not getting into it.

1293
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,886
Come on.

1294
00:50:38,628 --> 00:50:40,262
Hi.

1295
00:50:40,264 --> 00:50:42,530
I can't do
any more phone calls.

1296
00:50:42,532 --> 00:50:45,268
Oh, yeah?
They see through me.

1297
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:46,269
They see through this.

1298
00:50:46,271 --> 00:50:47,670
You should drink some coffee.

1299
00:50:47,672 --> 00:50:49,372
I had so much coffee,
but let's get food.

1300
00:50:49,374 --> 00:50:50,706
I need some...
do you want to get some?

1301
00:50:50,708 --> 00:50:52,275
Can't.
I'm slammed actually, Kate.

1302
00:50:52,277 --> 00:50:53,442
You're not having lunch?

1303
00:51:02,854 --> 00:51:04,721
Yo!

1304
00:51:04,723 --> 00:51:07,658
We have enough clean kegs for
the stuff in the bright tank?

1305
00:51:10,396 --> 00:51:11,496
Luke.

1306
00:51:11,498 --> 00:51:12,897
What's up?

1307
00:51:12,899 --> 00:51:14,666
What's up with the bright tank?
Are we good?

1308
00:51:14,668 --> 00:51:16,301
I'm working, Dave.

1309
00:51:16,303 --> 00:51:17,735
I'm asking you a work question.

1310
00:51:17,737 --> 00:51:19,537
What did you ask me, man?

1311
00:51:19,539 --> 00:51:21,806
I asked you if we have enough
clean kegs for the bright tank.

1312
00:51:21,808 --> 00:51:23,274
I'm not in the fucking mood,
man.

1313
00:51:23,276 --> 00:51:25,377
Everything's off.

1314
00:51:37,725 --> 00:51:39,392
Yeah.

1315
00:51:39,394 --> 00:51:40,660
You got to...
you got to revisit it.

1316
00:51:40,662 --> 00:51:43,496
It's amazing.

1317
00:51:43,498 --> 00:51:46,599
And the next development
is a canning line,

1318
00:51:46,601 --> 00:51:48,368
which is great,

1319
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:50,270
'cause as of now,
we can't sell the beer in cans.

1320
00:51:50,272 --> 00:51:51,572
Will you excuse me one second,
Eli?

1321
00:51:51,574 --> 00:51:52,873
Absolutely.

1322
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:55,643
I'm gonna be right...
right back.

1323
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:58,379
Yo.
Yo.

1324
00:51:58,381 --> 00:51:59,380
Where you going?

1325
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:00,881
Going home, man.

1326
00:52:00,883 --> 00:52:02,683
Why don't you stay
and have one beer with me?

1327
00:52:02,685 --> 00:52:04,519
'Cause I'm having a shit day,
and I'm ready...

1328
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:05,787
What are you doing?
Going home.

1329
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:06,788
You owe me a beer.

1330
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,023
I owe you a beer?

1331
00:52:08,025 --> 00:52:10,058
Yeah, we have to sit
and have a beer.

1332
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,627
Hey, guys. Drinks?

1333
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:13,628
Oh, we have plans.

1334
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,796
Oh, we do?

1335
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:15,931
All right.
Have fun, guys.

1336
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:17,399
You want to all get together,

1337
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:18,701
tip a few back
and see what happens?

1338
00:52:18,703 --> 00:52:20,470
Shut up. Dave.

1339
00:52:20,472 --> 00:52:22,739
Please?

1340
00:52:22,741 --> 00:52:24,340
One fucking beer.

1341
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:25,541
All right.

1342
00:52:25,543 --> 00:52:26,642
Thank you.

1343
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,611
I'm gonna go finish up with Eli.

1344
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:29,612
I'll be right back.

1345
00:52:29,614 --> 00:52:30,713
Great. Close the deal.

1346
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:31,882
I'll meet you over there.

1347
00:52:31,884 --> 00:52:33,450
Yeah, of course.
Thank you.

1348
00:52:33,452 --> 00:52:35,686
You're welcome.

1349
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:41,658
I was full of shit yesterday.

1350
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,794
I don't know.

1351
00:52:43,796 --> 00:52:45,096
Ugh, whatever.

1352
00:52:45,098 --> 00:52:47,098
Hey, here's the truth:

1353
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,334
I'm done giving you shit,
and I'm sorry.

1354
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:50,335
I have no place.

1355
00:52:50,337 --> 00:52:52,070
You are a grown woman,

1356
00:52:52,072 --> 00:52:55,673
and if you want to have sex
with a disgusting, bad brewer

1357
00:52:55,675 --> 00:52:59,078
with a terrible attitude...

1358
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,949
I don't love Dave.

1359
00:53:03,951 --> 00:53:05,484
You smell good.

1360
00:53:05,486 --> 00:53:06,485
Really?

1361
00:53:06,487 --> 00:53:07,820
Yeah.

1362
00:53:07,822 --> 00:53:10,923
Surprised you got all of Dave
off of ya.

1363
00:53:10,925 --> 00:53:13,760
Maybe you're smelling Dave.

1364
00:53:28,544 --> 00:53:31,779
Mine would be a futon,
and then all... you know...

1365
00:53:31,781 --> 00:53:33,648
It's just very... it's cool.

1366
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:35,683
It's, like, cozy,
but it's still all put together.

1367
00:53:35,685 --> 00:53:36,851
Jill, this place is so great.

1368
00:53:36,853 --> 00:53:38,754
Oh, thank you so much.

1369
00:53:38,756 --> 00:53:40,122
Yeah, she was
just complimenting it

1370
00:53:40,124 --> 00:53:41,990
and how great your style is
and all of that.

1371
00:53:41,992 --> 00:53:42,991
Oh, my style?

1372
00:53:42,993 --> 00:53:43,992
Yeah, you got style.

1373
00:53:43,994 --> 00:53:45,861
You got style, woman.

1374
00:53:45,863 --> 00:53:48,464
I've got a veggie lasagna,
but it's not done yet,

1375
00:53:48,466 --> 00:53:51,667
so I thought I would feed us
something for now.

1376
00:53:51,669 --> 00:53:52,735
Thank you. Wow.

1377
00:53:52,737 --> 00:53:53,736
You are the best.

1378
00:53:53,738 --> 00:53:54,938
This is great.

1379
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,573
Hey, cheers, everybody.
Yes.

1380
00:53:56,575 --> 00:53:58,942
To being in our house
and hanging out with us

1381
00:53:58,944 --> 00:53:59,976
and for making a great meal.

1382
00:53:59,978 --> 00:54:01,411
To our new kid.

1383
00:54:01,413 --> 00:54:04,180
Aw.
Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Dad.

1384
00:54:04,182 --> 00:54:05,482
Aw.
Couldn't resist.

1385
00:54:05,484 --> 00:54:06,917
I got her when she young.

1386
00:54:06,919 --> 00:54:08,919
She was 21.
She didn't know any better.

1387
00:54:08,921 --> 00:54:10,788
She hadn't seen the world yet.
I could really...

1388
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:12,590
I have a feeling she knew
what she was doing.

1389
00:54:12,592 --> 00:54:13,858
I could really do
my C-plus material,

1390
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,059
and she was like, "Wow."

1391
00:54:16,863 --> 00:54:19,096
I could be half drunk
and still make it work.

1392
00:54:19,098 --> 00:54:21,099
And then to evolve.
I mean, 21's so young.

1393
00:54:21,101 --> 00:54:22,934
And then you get older,
and so much happens.

1394
00:54:22,936 --> 00:54:25,003
You change in those years
drastically.

1395
00:54:25,005 --> 00:54:26,872
Oh, yeah.

1396
00:54:26,874 --> 00:54:29,541
No, I for sure thought that I
was gonna fuck a lot more dudes.

1397
00:54:30,544 --> 00:54:32,043
All right, Jill.

1398
00:54:32,045 --> 00:54:33,913
I'm right here.

1399
00:54:33,915 --> 00:54:35,481
I mean, that's the thing.

1400
00:54:35,483 --> 00:54:36,949
Yeah, maybe, like,
almost fuck a chick

1401
00:54:36,951 --> 00:54:38,718
and then chicken out.

1402
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,686
Right, just dabble.
That's what college is for.

1403
00:54:40,688 --> 00:54:41,921
But at least
I could have tried!

1404
00:54:41,923 --> 00:54:43,055
Right.

1405
00:54:43,057 --> 00:54:46,627
You still can, the last one.

1406
00:54:46,629 --> 00:54:48,128
I think that's great.

1407
00:54:49,498 --> 00:54:50,697
I mean, it's overrated.

1408
00:54:50,699 --> 00:54:52,099
That whole thing is overrated.

1409
00:54:52,101 --> 00:54:56,970
It ends in pain
and lots of walking in shame.

1410
00:54:56,972 --> 00:54:59,206
No, I feel lucky
I got a good one.

1411
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:02,043
I didn't have to wade through
too many...

1412
00:55:02,045 --> 00:55:03,077
Yeah.

1413
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:04,612
Bad ones.

1414
00:55:04,614 --> 00:55:07,148
Yeah.

1415
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:09,617
Good thing.

1416
00:55:33,844 --> 00:55:34,844
Hey, baby.

1417
00:55:34,846 --> 00:55:35,912
Hey.

1418
00:55:38,649 --> 00:55:40,985
Frank's an idiot.

1419
00:55:40,987 --> 00:55:42,086
What?

1420
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,888
Nothing.

1421
00:55:47,659 --> 00:55:49,627
You doing some packing?

1422
00:55:49,629 --> 00:55:51,228
Indeed.

1423
00:55:55,702 --> 00:55:57,803
What Narcissism Means to Me?

1424
00:56:00,306 --> 00:56:02,808
When did you start reading
a book of poetry?

1425
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:03,942
Do you know who gave me that?

1426
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:05,777
No.

1427
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:08,581
Uh, Chris.

1428
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:10,149
Chris of Kate and Chris.

1429
00:56:10,151 --> 00:56:11,851
Why did Chris
give you a book called

1430
00:56:11,853 --> 00:56:14,187
What Narcissism Means to Me?

1431
00:56:14,189 --> 00:56:15,622
Uh, I don't know.

1432
00:56:15,624 --> 00:56:18,224
The title,
I can't actually say...

1433
00:56:18,226 --> 00:56:21,662
Um, I don't want this.

1434
00:56:21,664 --> 00:56:25,599
But he just came by
the farmer's market,

1435
00:56:25,601 --> 00:56:29,203
and, like, gave me a...

1436
00:56:30,705 --> 00:56:32,606
He went to the farmer's market?

1437
00:56:32,608 --> 00:56:34,643
Yeah, he came by
the farmer's market.

1438
00:56:34,645 --> 00:56:38,246
He gave me, like, a...

1439
00:56:38,248 --> 00:56:39,581
What a sweet guy.

1440
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:40,782
Yeah. Yeah.

1441
00:56:40,784 --> 00:56:42,684
He seemed, like...
he seemed okay.

1442
00:56:42,686 --> 00:56:45,186
He seemed, like...

1443
00:56:45,188 --> 00:56:48,024
happy and healthy
and fine and...

1444
00:57:02,607 --> 00:57:04,241
Just, uh...

1445
00:57:07,078 --> 00:57:11,048
A reminder or a-a query.

1446
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:12,049
Um...

1447
00:57:12,051 --> 00:57:13,283
A query?

1448
00:57:13,285 --> 00:57:16,921
Have you been thinking
at all about

1449
00:57:16,923 --> 00:57:19,323
the old marriage convo,

1450
00:57:19,325 --> 00:57:20,324
the worst convo...

1451
00:57:20,326 --> 00:57:21,359
Yeah.

1452
00:57:21,361 --> 00:57:24,395
In the history of the world?

1453
00:57:24,397 --> 00:57:25,396
Absolutely.

1454
00:57:25,398 --> 00:57:26,397
Yeah?

1455
00:57:26,399 --> 00:57:27,932
Yes. I have.

1456
00:57:27,934 --> 00:57:29,835
What have... what have you been
thinking about?

1457
00:57:29,837 --> 00:57:31,003
All good stuff.

1458
00:57:31,005 --> 00:57:32,838
Yeah?

1459
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,773
Um...

1460
00:57:37,143 --> 00:57:38,410
Yeah,
just maybe while I'm gone,

1461
00:57:38,412 --> 00:57:41,814
like, if you have thoughts on

1462
00:57:41,816 --> 00:57:43,683
just general timing and...

1463
00:57:43,685 --> 00:57:46,086
Okay.

1464
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:47,654
You got it.

1465
00:57:47,656 --> 00:57:48,722
That would be great.

1466
00:57:48,724 --> 00:57:50,023
I'll give it a lot of thought.

1467
00:57:50,025 --> 00:57:51,758
That would make me feel
really good.

1468
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,992
Oh, good.
Okay.

1469
00:57:52,994 --> 00:57:54,060
You think about it too.

1470
00:57:54,062 --> 00:57:56,430
I'm gonna.

1471
00:57:56,432 --> 00:57:57,998
Good.

1472
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,867
Don't try to turn it around
on me.

1473
00:57:59,869 --> 00:58:01,068
You know I'm gonna.

1474
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:02,770
Okay.

1475
00:58:26,096 --> 00:58:27,830
Mm.

1476
00:58:34,171 --> 00:58:37,174
What'd you do tonight?

1477
00:58:37,176 --> 00:58:40,310
Um, I had some work to do,

1478
00:58:40,312 --> 00:58:42,012
and I did some reading.

1479
00:58:44,048 --> 00:58:45,415
Here you go.

1480
00:58:47,919 --> 00:58:49,888
Thank you.

1481
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:52,090
So what's up?

1482
00:58:52,092 --> 00:58:54,025
I don't know.
I was just out.

1483
00:58:54,027 --> 00:58:55,393
Uh-huh.

1484
00:58:55,395 --> 00:58:57,495
It's so hot out.

1485
00:58:57,497 --> 00:58:59,497
Just, like, sweating my...

1486
00:58:59,499 --> 00:59:00,498
Yeah.

1487
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,101
Sweating my balls off.

1488
00:59:03,103 --> 00:59:04,970
Yeah. What's up?

1489
00:59:04,972 --> 00:59:06,038
Sit down.

1490
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,173
No, I'm gonna stand.

1491
00:59:07,175 --> 00:59:09,074
Ugh, sit down.

1492
00:59:09,076 --> 00:59:10,142
I'm gonna stand here.

1493
00:59:10,144 --> 00:59:11,143
Tell me what's up.

1494
00:59:11,145 --> 00:59:12,278
Why'd you come over?

1495
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,979
'Cause I miss you.

1496
00:59:13,981 --> 00:59:15,314
Okay.

1497
00:59:15,316 --> 00:59:18,919
Um, here's the thing.

1498
00:59:18,921 --> 00:59:20,053
Yes?

1499
00:59:20,055 --> 00:59:21,922
All right?

1500
00:59:21,924 --> 00:59:23,223
Can you please...
it's hard...

1501
00:59:23,225 --> 00:59:25,091
it's not nice
to be on another level.

1502
00:59:25,093 --> 00:59:27,227
You have to sit, because I can't
hear you all the way up...

1503
00:59:27,229 --> 00:59:28,228
hello?

1504
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:29,796
Here's the thing.

1505
00:59:29,798 --> 00:59:31,232
I can't hear you up there.

1506
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,233
Okay. Kate?

1507
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,001
Yes.

1508
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:36,871
I was serious about
what I said the other day.

1509
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:39,307
I know, and I heard you.

1510
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:42,343
Yeah, well, what I said was,

1511
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:45,314
I don't think
that this is working.

1512
00:59:45,316 --> 00:59:46,315
I think...

1513
00:59:46,317 --> 00:59:47,883
Okay?

1514
00:59:47,885 --> 00:59:49,218
And I don't think
this is gonna work.

1515
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,552
I think you're wrong.

1516
00:59:50,554 --> 00:59:52,221
And I think eight months
is enough time

1517
00:59:52,223 --> 00:59:54,489
to know
whether something's gonna work.

1518
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:56,992
You know...

1519
00:59:56,994 --> 00:59:58,228
All right?

1520
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:09,839
What the fuck?

1521
01:00:09,841 --> 01:00:12,243
God damn it!

1522
01:00:12,245 --> 01:00:15,179
You stupid fucker!

1523
01:00:15,181 --> 01:00:18,015
Why didn't you take that one?

1524
01:00:18,017 --> 01:00:19,884
Oh, my God!

1525
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,628
Fucking...

1526
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:38,304
No, I'm... I'm really excited
to see the space,

1527
01:00:38,306 --> 01:00:41,440
and I've heard your food
is awesome.

1528
01:00:41,442 --> 01:00:42,508
Okay, great.

1529
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:43,609
I'll see you guys Wednesday.

1530
01:00:43,611 --> 01:00:45,177
Thank you.

1531
01:00:50,484 --> 01:00:52,052
That's what I do.

1532
01:00:52,054 --> 01:00:53,220
Impressive.

1533
01:00:53,222 --> 01:00:55,889
Hey, is your lady in Mexico?

1534
01:00:55,891 --> 01:00:56,924
Costa Rica.
Costa Rica?

1535
01:00:56,926 --> 01:00:58,292
Different.

1536
01:00:58,294 --> 01:01:00,394
Is she... uh, same-same,
sort of interchangeable.

1537
01:01:00,396 --> 01:01:01,895
You want to get dinner with me?

1538
01:01:01,897 --> 01:01:03,497
Dinner? Tonight?

1539
01:01:03,499 --> 01:01:05,366
Yes.
No, in a week and a half.

1540
01:01:05,368 --> 01:01:07,035
Tonight, yes.
You do?

1541
01:01:07,037 --> 01:01:08,036
Yeah.
Definitely.

1542
01:01:08,038 --> 01:01:09,404
I'm starving.

1543
01:01:09,406 --> 01:01:11,139
I just have to make
one more phone call.

1544
01:01:11,141 --> 01:01:12,440
Do you...
do you want to watch?

1545
01:01:12,442 --> 01:01:13,508
Yes.

1546
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:14,609
All right.

1547
01:01:14,611 --> 01:01:15,977
Weirdo.

1548
01:01:23,019 --> 01:01:24,019
Sorry.

1549
01:01:24,021 --> 01:01:25,120
Did you already pay?

1550
01:01:25,122 --> 01:01:26,121
I did.
Yeah, we're good.

1551
01:01:26,123 --> 01:01:27,122
How much do I owe you?

1552
01:01:27,124 --> 01:01:28,357
You owe me nothing, Kate.

1553
01:01:28,359 --> 01:01:29,358
Oh, come on.

1554
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,359
You owe me nothing.

1555
01:01:30,361 --> 01:01:31,593
What a gentleman.

1556
01:01:31,595 --> 01:01:33,129
Thanks, hubby.
Oh, I like you a lot.

1557
01:01:33,131 --> 01:01:35,398
So sweet. So nice.

1558
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,200
Are you ready?

1559
01:01:37,202 --> 01:01:39,436
Mm-hmm.

1560
01:01:39,438 --> 01:01:40,603
Here you go, my friend.

1561
01:01:40,605 --> 01:01:41,604
Mm.

1562
01:01:41,606 --> 01:01:42,672
Let me give you that.

1563
01:01:42,674 --> 01:01:44,040
Thank you.
Give me this.

1564
01:01:44,042 --> 01:01:45,376
Thanks.

1565
01:01:45,378 --> 01:01:47,244
Give me the pretzels.

1566
01:01:47,246 --> 01:01:48,346
You got a hold of 'em?

1567
01:01:48,348 --> 01:01:49,947
Okay.

1568
01:01:49,949 --> 01:01:51,315
Okay.

1569
01:01:51,317 --> 01:01:53,284
This is you.

1570
01:01:53,286 --> 01:01:54,318
Oh, thanks.

1571
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,353
Here you go, ma'am.

1572
01:01:55,355 --> 01:01:57,054
Hey.

1573
01:01:57,056 --> 01:01:58,089
Cheers to ya.

1574
01:01:58,091 --> 01:01:59,191
Cheers. Thanks for dinner.

1575
01:01:59,193 --> 01:02:01,193
Yeah.
Thanks for coming over.

1576
01:02:03,329 --> 01:02:05,364
Yum, yum, yum.

1577
01:02:06,566 --> 01:02:08,433
Mm.
You want 'em?

1578
01:02:08,435 --> 01:02:09,668
Mm-hmm.

1579
01:02:11,704 --> 01:02:13,639
It's so nice here.

1580
01:02:13,641 --> 01:02:15,341
So when we open up our bar...

1581
01:02:15,343 --> 01:02:18,177
Yeah.

1582
01:02:18,179 --> 01:02:19,379
Brewing in the back.

1583
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:20,546
Oh, yeah.

1584
01:02:20,548 --> 01:02:24,183
Cuba, Miami...

1585
01:02:24,185 --> 01:02:25,651
New Orleans.

1586
01:02:25,653 --> 01:02:28,956
I still vote Cuba.
I think we could do it.

1587
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:30,290
You do?

1588
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:31,992
We just have to sneak in
through Mexico.

1589
01:02:31,994 --> 01:02:33,527
What do you think
the aesthetic is again?

1590
01:02:33,529 --> 01:02:35,262
The aesthetic is...

1591
01:02:35,264 --> 01:02:37,331
Walk me through it. You walk
in 'cause I like...

1592
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:39,066
Reservoir Dogs
meets Casablanca.

1593
01:02:39,068 --> 01:02:41,002
How many times
do I have to tell you that?

1594
01:02:41,004 --> 01:02:42,971
'Cause all I think about

1595
01:02:42,973 --> 01:02:45,540
is fuckin' guys getting their
ears cut off in the back...

1596
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:47,208
Word.
And dudes... no.

1597
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:48,209
What a nice apartment.

1598
01:02:48,211 --> 01:02:49,611
I want a Jill.

1599
01:02:49,613 --> 01:02:51,112
Yeah, I'm glad I got her.

1600
01:02:51,114 --> 01:02:52,714
Can you find me one, please?

1601
01:02:52,716 --> 01:02:56,585
Does she have a male clone?

1602
01:02:56,587 --> 01:02:58,487
She's got a brother,
but he's weird as fuck.

1603
01:02:58,489 --> 01:02:59,588
I'll take it.

1604
01:03:17,475 --> 01:03:20,311
♪ So maybe later, man

1605
01:03:20,313 --> 01:03:23,081
♪ There's an elegant land

1606
01:03:23,083 --> 01:03:24,715
♪ In the darkness

1607
01:03:28,488 --> 01:03:30,388
Right?

1608
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:31,789
Do you like it?

1609
01:03:31,791 --> 01:03:32,790
It's good.

1610
01:03:32,792 --> 01:03:34,526
It's groovy.

1611
01:03:34,528 --> 01:03:37,029
That's how I'm described a lot
by my peers.

1612
01:03:37,031 --> 01:03:38,330
"He's a groovy fella."

1613
01:03:38,332 --> 01:03:40,799
Good and groovy.

1614
01:03:43,104 --> 01:03:45,370
That's a very important
pressure point.

1615
01:03:45,372 --> 01:03:46,538
What's this spot?

1616
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:47,740
That's your heart.

1617
01:03:47,742 --> 01:03:49,709
Oh, wow.

1618
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:56,416
Oh, Lord,
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

1619
01:03:56,418 --> 01:03:57,517
Okay.

1620
01:03:59,353 --> 01:04:00,554
All right, come here.

1621
01:04:00,556 --> 01:04:01,555
I'm gonna give you a massage.

1622
01:04:01,557 --> 01:04:03,157
Oh.

1623
01:04:03,159 --> 01:04:05,192
Be very careful
that you don't get hurt.

1624
01:04:06,828 --> 01:04:09,396
Okay, ready?

1625
01:04:09,398 --> 01:04:10,598
I've never been more ready.

1626
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,366
Honestly, I've never been.

1627
01:04:12,368 --> 01:04:13,667
Ohh!

1628
01:04:13,669 --> 01:04:16,838
Again with the fucking sounds!

1629
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,440
I'm vocal about...

1630
01:04:18,442 --> 01:04:19,641
You have to be more quiet.

1631
01:04:19,643 --> 01:04:21,510

I have to pee so bad.

1644
01:05:03,489 --> 01:05:05,523
Do you have food here?

1645
01:05:05,525 --> 01:05:07,292
No.

1646
01:05:16,836 --> 01:05:17,836
I'm not going far.

1647
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:19,605
I just need a smaller place,

1648
01:05:19,607 --> 01:05:21,875
'cause my place
is meant for two,

1649
01:05:21,877 --> 01:05:24,811
and I am meant for one.

1650
01:05:24,813 --> 01:05:28,248
So I am moving
to a little place.

1651
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:29,316
It's good.

1652
01:05:29,318 --> 01:05:30,318
It's got just enough room

1653
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:33,486
for me and my imaginary cat.

1654
01:05:36,592 --> 01:05:37,925
Yeah, if you want help moving,

1655
01:05:37,927 --> 01:05:39,460
I'd be happy to do it.

1656
01:05:39,462 --> 01:05:41,229
Especially if you got to be out
by tomorrow.

1657
01:05:41,231 --> 01:05:42,431
You don't want to help me move.

1658
01:05:42,432 --> 01:05:43,531
No, I'm willing to help you.

1659
01:05:43,533 --> 01:05:44,565
You're you. I'll do it.

1660
01:05:44,567 --> 01:05:45,600
It's an awful job.

1661
01:05:45,602 --> 01:05:47,301
Moving is what happens in hell.

1662
01:05:50,873 --> 01:05:52,174
Um...

1663
01:05:52,176 --> 01:05:53,842
When was the party?

1664
01:05:53,844 --> 01:05:54,843
You were there.

1665
01:05:54,845 --> 01:05:56,545
It was for my birthday.

1666
01:05:56,547 --> 01:05:58,847
This is from
your birthday party, Kate?

1667
01:05:58,849 --> 01:05:59,948
Yeah.

1668
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:01,783
Are you kidding me, man?

1669
01:06:01,785 --> 01:06:03,319
Well, I knew I was moving,

1670
01:06:03,321 --> 01:06:06,756
so I didn't bother, you know...

1671
01:06:06,758 --> 01:06:09,292
Anyway,
I feel like we should start...

1672
01:06:09,294 --> 01:06:11,594
First of all, I think
we should clean everything.

1673
01:06:11,596 --> 01:06:12,762
Oh, I don't know if there's...

1674
01:06:12,764 --> 01:06:13,896
it's gonna get dirty anyway.

1675
01:06:13,898 --> 01:06:15,498
The cake is still here!

1676
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:16,834
I know. I ate it all.

1677
01:06:16,836 --> 01:06:21,372
It was, like,
the best breakfast food.

1678
01:06:21,374 --> 01:06:22,973
Here, I got bags.

1679
01:06:22,975 --> 01:06:25,843
All right, great.

1680
01:06:38,257 --> 01:06:39,791
Kitchen's done.
Oh, my God.

1681
01:06:39,793 --> 01:06:41,459
Living room's done.
What?

1682
01:06:41,461 --> 01:06:42,560
Dining room's done.

1683
01:06:42,562 --> 01:06:43,796
Oh, my God!

1684
01:06:43,798 --> 01:06:45,264
Yeah, we are groovin'.

1685
01:06:45,266 --> 01:06:46,832
That's such good news.

1686
01:06:46,834 --> 01:06:48,601
This is a little chaotic.
Ooh, I'm so hot.

1687
01:06:48,603 --> 01:06:49,803
Just throwing it in like that?

1688
01:06:49,804 --> 01:06:51,570
Yeah.

1689
01:06:51,572 --> 01:06:53,406
Yeah, 'cause I'm just gonna
take it right out.

1690
01:06:53,408 --> 01:06:54,607
Smart.
How about the towels?

1691
01:06:54,609 --> 01:06:55,941
You want to just throw those
on top?

1692
01:06:55,943 --> 01:06:56,943
Oh, yeah.

1693
01:06:56,945 --> 01:06:58,011
For protection.

1694
01:07:00,281 --> 01:07:02,416
I like your style, friend.

1695
01:07:04,652 --> 01:07:05,786
Thanks.

1696
01:07:05,788 --> 01:07:06,987
Can I have a sip?

1697
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:08,889
Yes, ma'am.

Good.

1747
01:10:18,194 --> 01:10:19,828
So here's what I think

1748

Tell me what you think.

1749
01:10:21,598 --> 01:10:23,198

I'm gonna get the U-Haul.

I already called it in.

1751

If you want to finish
doing this kitchen,

1752
01:10:26,503 --> 01:10:27,502

01:10:31,775 --> 01:10:33,876
we shower, we dress up,

1757
01:10:33,878 --> 01:10:35,678
and we go
to a nice dinner on me.

1758
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,079
Really?

1759
01:10:37,081 --> 01:10:38,748

Feel good about it.

1760
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:40,550
Celebrate these couple of days.

1761
01:10:40,552 --> 01:10:42,985
Celebrate the move.
Get a nice bite to eat.

1762
01:10:42,987 --> 01:10:43,986
Okay.

1763
01:10:43,988 --> 01:10:44,987
Deal?
Deal.

1764
01:10:44,989 --> 01:10:46,857
Sealed.

1765
01:10:46,859 --> 01:10:48,759
Okay.

1766
01:11:15,956 --> 01:11:17,289

Yep.

1767

1768
01:11:18,793 --> 01:11:20,793

Yeah.

Ah, fucking Christ!

1770
01:11:22,296 --> 01:11:23,996
Fuck!

1771
01:11:23,998 --> 01:11:26,165
What happened?

1772
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:28,068
Did you drop it?

1773
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:30,570
There's a nail
in the fucking couch.

1774
01:11:30,572 --> 01:11:31,571
Oh.

1775
01:11:31,573 --> 01:11:32,839
Ah, f...

1776
01:11:32,841 --> 01:11:34,541
Are you bleeding?

1777
01:11:34,543 --> 01:11:36,977
Did it get on the upholstery?

1778
01:11:36,979 --> 01:11:38,278
I don't even know
how to clean this.

1779
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,982
Ah, fucking A.

1780
01:11:40,984 --> 01:11:42,650
Let's... let's just get it out
the door.

1781
01:11:42,652 --> 01:11:43,918
All right, just stop, Kate.

1782
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,753
Wait.
Give me one fucking second.

1783
01:11:47,556 --> 01:11:49,624
Ahh...

1784
01:11:49,626 --> 01:11:50,858
Ah.

1785
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:52,126
Fucking cr...

1786
01:11:52,128 --> 01:11:53,594
Ah-ha-ha.

1787
01:11:53,596 --> 01:11:55,163
I just left the couch
sitting on the...

1788
01:11:55,165 --> 01:11:57,065
ah, fuck!

1789
01:11:57,067 --> 01:11:59,134
Yeah, I think
I'm gonna need stitches.

1790
01:11:59,136 --> 01:12:00,902
Oh, God, I'm gonna be sick.

1791
01:12:00,904 --> 01:12:02,604
Yeah, you got any peroxide
or anything?

1792
01:12:02,606 --> 01:12:04,306
Oh, my God,
I'm not good with...

1793
01:12:04,308 --> 01:12:06,208
Kate, get me some peroxide,
please.

1794
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:07,710
I'm sorry
you're not good with it.

1795
01:12:07,712 --> 01:12:09,178
I'm fucking bleeding.

1796
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:11,347
Just get me a fucking
paper towel, please, then.

1797
01:12:11,349 --> 01:12:12,682
I have... I don't know...

1798
01:12:12,684 --> 01:12:13,750
Just do something!

1799
01:12:13,752 --> 01:12:14,984
Fuck!

1800
01:12:14,986 --> 01:12:16,853
Okay, I found them.

1801
01:12:16,855 --> 01:12:17,854
Okay, great.

1802
01:12:17,856 --> 01:12:18,855
Oh, my God.

1803
01:12:18,857 --> 01:12:19,856
Okay, here.

1804
01:12:19,858 --> 01:12:21,725
Oh, my God.

1805
01:12:21,727 --> 01:12:22,760
That's...

1806
01:12:22,762 --> 01:12:23,761
Ahh.

1807
01:12:23,763 --> 01:12:24,862
That's really bad.

1808
01:12:24,864 --> 01:12:26,196
It's really, really, really bad.

1809
01:12:26,198 --> 01:12:28,065
Yeah, it's okay.
It's okay.

1810
01:12:28,067 --> 01:12:31,068
Should I call... you know,
should I call an ambulance?

1811
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:32,236
Ahh.

1812
01:12:34,105 --> 01:12:35,807
Ah.

1813
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:37,075
Ah, ha-ha.

1814
01:12:37,077 --> 01:12:38,076
Ha-ha-ha.

1815
01:12:38,078 --> 01:12:40,645
Ah, f...

1816
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:43,882
Ah, fucking piece of shit.

1817
01:12:48,789 --> 01:12:49,955
Hey, is this you?

1818
01:12:49,957 --> 01:12:51,057
Yeah, that's me.

1819
01:12:51,059 --> 01:12:52,825
Move your fucking van, buddy!

1820
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:54,260
Wait, we just have to get
the couch in.

1821
01:12:54,262 --> 01:12:56,028
Hey, pal.

1822
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:58,097
I don't care what
your fucking girlfriend says!

1823
01:12:58,099 --> 01:12:59,732
Move the van, pal!
Are you kidding?

1824
01:12:59,734 --> 01:13:00,866
Hang on one second.

1825
01:13:00,868 --> 01:13:02,202
Shut up, lady!

1826
01:13:02,204 --> 01:13:03,870
It's fucking hot out here.

1827
01:13:03,872 --> 01:13:05,672
I've been out here
for five fucking minutes!

1828
01:13:05,674 --> 01:13:07,207
Fuck you.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1829
01:13:07,209 --> 01:13:08,709
I've tried being fucking cool!

1830
01:13:08,711 --> 01:13:10,243
Give me the fucking keys then,
shithead!

1831
01:13:10,245 --> 01:13:11,244
Luke! Luke! Luke!

1832
01:13:11,246 --> 01:13:12,679
Move the fucking van, asshole!

1833
01:13:12,681 --> 01:13:13,947
Jesus Christ!
I'll move the van.

1834
01:13:13,949 --> 01:13:16,217
I will move it.

1835
01:13:16,219 --> 01:13:17,819
He's really... he's lucky.

1836
01:13:17,821 --> 01:13:19,220
You're lucky.

1837
01:13:19,222 --> 01:13:20,922
You're lucky
that no one called the cops.

1838
01:13:20,924 --> 01:13:22,790
You're lucky
he didn't press charges.

1839
01:13:22,792 --> 01:13:24,892
He's lucky I didn't continue
to kick his fucking ass.

1840
01:13:24,894 --> 01:13:25,893
Oh, my God.

1841
01:13:25,895 --> 01:13:27,228
What is the point of that?

1842
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:28,964
That's so stupid.
This is so stupid.

1843
01:13:28,966 --> 01:13:30,933
Can I just call...
I'm just gonna call some people,

1844
01:13:30,935 --> 01:13:33,135
and have them come and help me
move out of my fucking place.

1845
01:13:33,137 --> 01:13:35,304
Kate, give me one... give me one
fucking second, please.

1846
01:13:35,306 --> 01:13:37,005
I made room!

1847
01:13:37,007 --> 01:13:39,007
This futuristic device,
I wasn't familiar with.

1848
01:13:39,009 --> 01:13:40,876
Please be careful with it.
It's my love life.

1849
01:13:40,878 --> 01:13:43,079
Is it? It's all you got?
Do you think it needs a box?

1850
01:13:43,081 --> 01:13:44,781
No, I think...
I think it's fine.

1851
01:13:44,783 --> 01:13:46,316
I think if you have any luck,
it'll break.

1852
01:13:46,318 --> 01:13:48,885
Oh.

1853
01:13:48,887 --> 01:13:50,854
Oh, wow.

1854
01:13:50,856 --> 01:13:52,455
So manly. So strapping.

1855
01:13:52,457 --> 01:13:54,290
Yeah, I got everything.

1856
01:13:59,765 --> 01:14:01,465
Tell me more
about this beer you have.

1857
01:14:01,467 --> 01:14:05,436
Oh, ow, ow, ow.

1858
01:14:05,438 --> 01:14:08,773
Ow, ow.

1859
01:14:08,775 --> 01:14:12,778
Ow, ow, ow.

1860
01:14:25,159 --> 01:14:27,393
Oh, fucking Christ.

1861
01:14:38,973 --> 01:14:41,575
How's your hand?

1862
01:14:46,414 --> 01:14:49,016
There used to be a cool
magic store around here.

1863
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:54,155
Careful with my pussy.

1864
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:57,292
How long have you been waiting
to say that?

1865
01:14:57,294 --> 01:14:59,194
The whole U-haul ride,
you've been thinking...

1866
01:14:59,196 --> 01:15:00,528
All day.

1867
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:02,163
"Oh, when he gets
to take that out"...

1868
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:03,532
Dude.

1869
01:15:16,547 --> 01:15:18,548
Okay.

1870
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:20,317
I know I sound
like a broken record,

1871
01:15:20,319 --> 01:15:22,352
but just to be honest,

1872
01:15:22,354 --> 01:15:24,955
this place... it rules.

1873
01:15:24,957 --> 01:15:26,022
Right?
It's awesome.

1874
01:15:26,024 --> 01:15:27,257
I think it's awesome too.

1875
01:15:27,259 --> 01:15:28,792
I think it smells like cats
in here.

1876
01:15:28,794 --> 01:15:30,394
It doesn't smell like cats.

1877
01:15:30,396 --> 01:15:32,363
I think it... I think it
honestly smells like a zoo.

1878
01:15:32,365 --> 01:15:33,364
No.
I love wood paneling.

1879
01:15:33,366 --> 01:15:34,832
Wood paneling is amazing.

1880
01:15:34,834 --> 01:15:37,201
You don't see that.
"I love wood."

1881
01:15:37,203 --> 01:15:39,103
Honestly, Kate,
this place smells like rhinos.

1882
01:15:39,105 --> 01:15:40,171
No.

1883
01:15:50,216 --> 01:15:52,017
It's great, like I said.
The wood paneling.

1884
01:15:52,019 --> 01:15:53,585
If you help me do the taps,
I'll do the taps.

1885
01:15:53,587 --> 01:15:55,053
Yeah, I'll help.

1886
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:56,421
We just need stools
and the sign.

1887
01:15:56,423 --> 01:15:57,557
Yeah, we can pull
some stuff from work.

1888
01:15:57,559 --> 01:15:59,325
Just let me know.

1889
01:15:59,327 --> 01:16:00,960
Is that everything?
That's everything, yeah.

1890
01:16:00,962 --> 01:16:02,428
Oh, my God, you're a hero.

1891
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:03,830
Thank you guys so much.
You're welcome.

1892
01:16:03,832 --> 01:16:05,131
I really appreciate it.

1893
01:16:05,133 --> 01:16:06,466
We're gonna go out,
as per the uge,

1894
01:16:06,468 --> 01:16:08,101
get some drinks,
so if you want to come,

1895
01:16:08,103 --> 01:16:09,369
just shoot me a text
or something.

1896
01:16:09,371 --> 01:16:10,905
Cool.
Yeah, sounds fun. Thank you.

1897
01:16:10,907 --> 01:16:12,139
All right, enjoy the new place.

1898
01:16:12,141 --> 01:16:13,140
All right, bye.

1899
01:16:13,142 --> 01:16:14,642
Bye.

1900
01:16:27,857 --> 01:16:28,990
Is it okay?

1901
01:16:28,992 --> 01:16:30,625
Yeah, it just hurts.

1902
01:16:33,863 --> 01:16:35,297
I might have...

1903
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:37,098
in one of the boxes,
there's, like, Tylenol.

1904
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,334
I don't know where it is,
though.

1905
01:16:38,336 --> 01:16:40,069
It's all right.
Thanks, man.

1906
01:16:45,208 --> 01:16:46,876
Mm.

1907
01:16:46,878 --> 01:16:48,411
Well, we did it.

1908
01:16:48,413 --> 01:16:49,979
Yeah, thank you.

1909
01:16:49,981 --> 01:16:51,481
Thank you.

1910
01:16:53,985 --> 01:16:56,053
Oh, sorry, my elbow
was pushing against your rib.

1911
01:16:56,055 --> 01:16:57,454
Ugh.

1912
01:16:57,456 --> 01:17:01,491
I seriously want to say
that I apologize.

1913
01:17:01,493 --> 01:17:02,960
For what?

1914
01:17:02,962 --> 01:17:04,227
For my elbow
going into your rib.

1915
01:17:04,229 --> 01:17:07,498
Oh. Ow!

1916
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:08,499
Don't.

1917
01:17:08,501 --> 01:17:11,402
So should we shower up?

1918
01:17:11,404 --> 01:17:13,137
You want to take a shower?

1919
01:17:13,139 --> 01:17:14,906
Yeah.

1920
01:17:14,908 --> 01:17:17,041
Take you out to that nice meal
I promised you.

1921
01:17:17,043 --> 01:17:18,644
Why don't we just go have beer
with the guys?

1922
01:17:18,646 --> 01:17:19,645
No. Pass.

1923
01:17:19,647 --> 01:17:21,313
Why not?

1924
01:17:21,315 --> 01:17:23,515
Because
I don't want to fucking see...

1925
01:17:23,517 --> 01:17:26,485
I barely like Frank and Mike.

1926
01:17:26,487 --> 01:17:28,988
I don't like Dave.

1927
01:17:28,990 --> 01:17:30,422
We're gonna see them
tomorrow anyway.

1928
01:17:30,424 --> 01:17:32,025
I kind of feel like

1929
01:17:32,027 --> 01:17:33,628
I'm gonna have a drink
with them, though.

1930
01:17:36,497 --> 01:17:37,497
You should come, though.

1931
01:17:37,499 --> 01:17:39,532
You should totally come.

1932
01:17:39,534 --> 01:17:42,002
Have fun.

1933
01:17:43,005 --> 01:17:44,004
No, you should come.

1934
01:17:44,006 --> 01:17:45,339
We'll, like, play pool.

1935
01:17:45,341 --> 01:17:46,707
Oh, right on, sweet.
I feel like it.

1936
01:17:46,709 --> 01:17:48,509
That sounds really cool, man.
Great.

1937
01:17:48,511 --> 01:17:50,511
Play some pool with the guys,
and then just see what happens.

1938
01:17:50,513 --> 01:17:52,046
Play some...

1939
01:17:52,048 --> 01:17:53,414
Don't do that.
Don't be shitty, please.

1940
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:54,415
We'll just goof around
with the guys.

1941
01:17:54,417 --> 01:17:56,050
Don't do that.

1942
01:17:56,052 --> 01:17:57,385
And we'll pretend like
there was nothing weird

1943
01:17:57,387 --> 01:17:58,386
about just going
out with the guys.

1944
01:17:58,388 --> 01:18:00,055
Why is there something weird?

1945
01:18:00,057 --> 01:18:01,556
Because we had plans.
That's what humans do.

1946
01:18:01,558 --> 01:18:03,225
We make plans,
then we follow through.

1947
01:18:03,227 --> 01:18:05,027
But if you want to go out
with the guys, then...

1948
01:18:05,029 --> 01:18:06,328
Stop. Stop it.

1949
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:08,163
Then do
whatever the fuck you want.

1950
01:18:08,165 --> 01:18:09,998
Stop, you're not allowed
to make me feel bad about this.

1951
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,266
I'm kind of allowed
to do whatever I want.

1952
01:18:11,268 --> 01:18:12,301
No, you're really not.

1953
01:18:12,303 --> 01:18:13,503
You're really not allowed

1954
01:18:13,505 --> 01:18:15,038
to make me feel bad
about something.

1955
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,672
I haven't done anything wrong,
Luke.

1956
01:18:16,674 --> 01:18:17,707
You realize that, right?

1957
01:18:17,709 --> 01:18:19,742
I haven't betrayed you.

1958
01:18:19,744 --> 01:18:22,278
There's nothing that you can say
that I've done that's wrong.

1959
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,380
I am a single human being
hanging out with my friends.

1960
01:18:24,382 --> 01:18:26,116
I agree.

1961
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:28,018
Okay, you may have
some other shit to deal with.

1962
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:29,086
Don't... don't...

1963
01:18:29,088 --> 01:18:30,754
That has nothing to do with me.

1964
01:18:30,756 --> 01:18:32,489
I don't want to have one
of these big things with you.

1965
01:18:32,491 --> 01:18:34,258
I'm just saying.

1966
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:36,226
I know you like the...
I'm not having a big thing.

1967
01:18:36,228 --> 01:18:37,761
Don't... just...
you don't have to touch me.

1968
01:18:37,763 --> 01:18:40,265
I think maybe
you should just go.

1969
01:18:40,267 --> 01:18:43,268
Oh, would you please
get a hold of this moment?

1970
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:45,003
Would you please
get a hold of this moment?

1971
01:18:45,005 --> 01:18:46,638
No, I refuse
to be made to feel bad.

1972
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,106
I don't have to be made
to feel bad.

1973
01:18:48,108 --> 01:18:50,075
Good for you.
Stop it!

1974
01:18:50,077 --> 01:18:52,610
Stop doing
the fucking face and voice!

1975
01:18:52,612 --> 01:18:54,513
That's not what I sound like,
okay?

1976
01:18:54,515 --> 01:18:57,116
I am not a bad person, okay?

1977
01:18:57,118 --> 01:18:58,784
You're my friend.
I agree.

1978
01:18:58,786 --> 01:19:01,353
And you're not allowed to make
me feel like a fucking slut

1979
01:19:01,355 --> 01:19:03,022
for fucking who I want,

1980
01:19:03,024 --> 01:19:05,024
because I'm allowed to,
because I am single.

1981
01:19:05,026 --> 01:19:07,761
You are not.

1982
01:19:07,763 --> 01:19:08,795
Don't do that.

1983
01:19:08,797 --> 01:19:10,230
What?

1984
01:19:10,232 --> 01:19:11,512
I'm just
telling the truth, so...

1985
01:19:14,735 --> 01:19:16,136
Don't do that.

1986
01:19:16,138 --> 01:19:17,704
You made your own bed,
all right?

1987
01:19:17,706 --> 01:19:19,206
And you fucking slept in it.

1988
01:19:19,208 --> 01:19:22,877
Well, you didn't stop me.

1989
01:19:24,413 --> 01:19:25,446
All right, Kate.

1990
01:19:25,448 --> 01:19:26,547
All right.

1991
01:19:27,549 --> 01:19:30,418
Sorry it ended so bad tonight.

1992
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:32,553
It wasn't my intent.
Have fun.

1993
01:19:32,555 --> 01:19:34,423
Go home...

1994
01:19:34,425 --> 01:19:35,591

How come you're crying?

2021
01:21:06,223 --> 01:21:07,655
The trip was just shitty.
Just...

2022
01:21:07,657 --> 01:21:08,857
It was?

2023
01:21:08,859 --> 01:21:10,426
Needed to come home, you know?

2024
01:21:10,428 --> 01:21:12,261
Did anything happen,
or was it just bad?

2025
01:21:12,263 --> 01:21:13,529
It just...

2026
01:21:13,531 --> 01:21:15,898
It just sucked.
It just sucked.

2027
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:18,567
Were there, like, fights,
or did something...

2028
01:21:21,472 --> 01:21:23,740
Careful.
Like, I ripped it with a nail.

2029
01:21:23,742 --> 01:21:25,375
Okay.

2030
01:21:25,377 --> 01:21:27,477
Oh, Jesus.

2031
01:21:30,781 --> 01:21:32,482
You okay, Jill?

2032
01:21:32,484 --> 01:21:33,950
Yeah.

2033
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:35,886
When we were in Michigan,
something happened.

2034
01:21:35,888 --> 01:21:40,491
And I needed to come home
and tell you, um...

2035
01:21:44,229 --> 01:21:47,765
I went on that hike with Chris,

2036
01:21:47,767 --> 01:21:50,769
and, uh, we ended up kissing.

2037
01:21:50,771 --> 01:21:53,639
And, um...

2038
01:21:55,742 --> 01:21:59,845
And I just needed to come
home and tell you that...

2039
01:21:59,847 --> 01:22:01,580
I needed to tell you that

2040
01:22:01,582 --> 01:22:04,884
and that I'm really sorry,
and I really fucked up.

2041
01:22:04,886 --> 01:22:05,885
I want to be with you.

2042
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:08,588
I want to...

2043
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:10,790
I just couldn't not tell you.

2044
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:19,233
I-I didn't want to tell you,

2045
01:22:19,235 --> 01:22:20,467
but it just felt worse
and worse,

2046
01:22:20,469 --> 01:22:21,969
and I had to just...

2047
01:22:21,971 --> 01:22:24,938
I just had to come home
and tell you.

2048
01:22:31,847 --> 01:22:34,049
Is that it?

2049
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:41,923
I don't know.

2050
01:22:41,925 --> 01:22:44,493
I... yeah?

2051
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:48,431
Are you in love with him
at all?

2052
01:22:48,433 --> 01:22:49,665
No, no.

2053
01:22:49,667 --> 01:22:51,567
No, not at all.
Not at all.

2054
01:22:51,569 --> 01:22:55,938
It was just, like,
a really pathetic,

2055
01:22:55,940 --> 01:22:59,376
gross thing to do.

2056
01:23:00,545 --> 01:23:02,746
And...

2057
01:23:02,748 --> 01:23:04,915
You're okay, Jill.

2058
01:23:53,468 --> 01:23:55,770
So I say
we strike while the iron's hot.

2059
01:23:55,772 --> 01:23:58,372
You know, maybe even as early
as next week, hopefully?

2060
01:23:58,374 --> 01:24:00,608
We go out there
to Three Floyds,

2061
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:02,076
and maybe, you know,
leave early,

2062
01:24:02,078 --> 01:24:03,845
like around 3:00,
next Thursday or Friday,

2063

you know, a lot of the guys.
