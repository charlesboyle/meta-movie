1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,081
<i>Look alive.</i>

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,766
<i>Contact appears to be heading
315 miles.</i>

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,287
<i>Speed 430, Angels.
Approximately 2,000.</i>

4
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,884
What's taking this guy so long?

5
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,803
Is he really as good as they say he is?

6
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,087
No. Better.

7
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,368
Oh yeah!

8
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,150
Whoa! Who was that?

9
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,882
Well, hello, ladies.
Are you ready to lose?

10
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,122
Last one to the water tower
buys a round of fuel.

11
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,441
Tell you what,
I'll give you guys a head start.

12
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,649
- You're going to need it.
- Later, loser.

13
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,611
One one-thousand, two one...
That all got's enough.

14
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,205
See ya, suckers!

15
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,527
Eat my...

16
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,450
Dusty!

17
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,647
Pay attention.
You're daydreaming again.

18
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,008
Ah, me? No, no, no! No.

19
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,127
Okay, yes.

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,302
But, you know, come on, Leadbottom.

21
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,164
Really? How hard is this?

22
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,761
Fly straight, turn around.
Fly straight, turn around.

23
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,142
Are you disrespecting
the sweet science of aerial application?

24
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,043
Look, I am more than just a crop duster.

25
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,808
Don't go flap-jawing

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,846
about that Flings Around the Planet
air racing nonsense again.

27
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,163
Excuse me, it is called
the Wings Around the Globe Rally.

28
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,451
For the love of Peterbilt!

29
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,867
And it's not nonsense.
I've got a tight turn radius

30
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,566
and a high power-to-weight ratio.

31
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,921
- You know what else you got?
- What?

32
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,121
A screw loose!

33
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,242
I mean, why would you
want to give up crop-dusting?

34
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,203
Blue skies, no air traffic,
and that tangy scent of Vita-minamulch.

35
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,768
Just like Momma used to spray.

36
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,041
- Oh.
- Delicious.

37
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,930
They say the sense of smell
is the first thing to go.

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,082
- You smell it?
- Oh, quitting time!

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,161
A crop duster wanting to be a racer.

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,450
If you ask me, more racers
should want to be crop dusters.

41
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,243
I got some minamulch, yeah!
Minamulch

42
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,905
Nowadays, they got soybean fuel,
switchgrass fuel, algae fuel. Come on!

43
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,909
- Healthy! No tank you.
- Tell me about it.

44
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,641
- What's next, pistachio propane?
- What, are you nuts?

45
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,365
For my money, there's nothing like
good old-fashioned corn fuel.

46
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,522
- Yeah, you betcha.
- I even made up a slogan.

47
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,360
Slogans are good.

48
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,088
"Corn. it gives you gas."

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,048
Catchy. I like that.

50
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,521
Me, too. There you go, Sparky,
you're all set.

51
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,330
- Catch you later, Chug.
- Sure thing.

52
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,847
<i>This is Dusty Crophopper to Chug.
Over.</i>

53
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,683
Chug isn't here.
Come on, use the new call sign.

54
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,727
<i>Right, right, right.</i>

55
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,646
<i>This is Strut Jetstream
calling Turbo Coach Truck-zilla.</i>

56
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,724
<i>- Ready for practice?</i>
- You betcha, Strut.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,286
Young punk.

58
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,124
All right, buddy, I got you in sight.

59
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,168
Now let's start with
some corn-row sprints.

60
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,049
<i>Drop and give me 20!</i>

61
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,844
<i>Come on, buddy, keep it going!</i>

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,490
<i>- Nice turn.</i>
- What else you got?

63
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,049
Okay. Now, let's try
some treeline moguls.

64
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,340
Yeah!

65
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,442
<i>All the way up and down.</i>

66
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,607
<i>Don't be dogging it.</i>

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,761
<i>- That's how you do it.
- Yeah!</i>

68
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,444
<i>Looking good!</i>

69
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,446
Okay, adjust your angle of bank
with your alien irons!

70
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,804
- You mean "ailerons"?
<i>- Oh yeah.</i>

71
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,990
Oh, great.

72
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,010
- Oil lines and oil cooler check out.
- Hmm-hm.

73
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,651
- AN-8 fittings look fine.
- Nice.

74
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,370
Wait a minute.

75
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,046
You've worn out your main oil-seal.

76
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,250
Oh, really?

77
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,645
- That kind of damage comes from extremely
- Hey!

78
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,619
...high speeds.

79
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,466
Pushing the engine to the red line
for prolonged periods of time.

80
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,481
- That would be unwise.
- But that's not you.

81
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,194
- No.
- You're a crop duster and

82
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,794
all you do is just dust crops

83
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,969
- at very low speeds.
- Yep, low and slow.

84
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,851
Unless you've been racing again!

85
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,971
No! What, me? No.

86
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,328
Oh, man, Duster, you were in the zone,

87
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,249
where a Saturn rocket
couldn't catch you!

88
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,401
Ballistic!

89
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,862
We're talking light speed.
Light speed, here!

90
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,145
You're going to tear it up
at the qualifier this weekend.

91
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,689
Yo-ho, Shelby.

92
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,050
Um, I don't know.

93
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,487
Dusty, you're not built to race.

94
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,483
You're built to dust crops.

95
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,007
Do you know what will happen
if you push it too far?

96
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,304
Wing flutter,
metal fatigue, turbine failure.

97
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,971
- Turbine failure?
- Oh, no, I'm going down!

98
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,330
Why didn't I listen to Dottie?

99
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,960
Yeah, why don't you listen to Dottie?

100
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,689
She's the smartest mechanic
in the world!

101
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,041
- Oh, my gosh!
- What?

102
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,730
- The orphanage!
- No.

103
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,067
- Not the orphanage!
- Kids, out of the way!

104
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,660
Kaboom!

105
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,286
The kids!

106
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,286
Wow. That was vivid and specific.

107
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,648
And exactly why I need you
to come with us to the qualifier.

108
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,001
You're unbelievable.

109
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,267
Did you hear that? I'm unbelievable.

110
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,688
The orphans!

111
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,684
<i>Tune in, in two weeks for the start of
the Wings Around the Globe.</i>

112
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,189
You know, I think we've got
a really good shot at this, buddy.

113
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,966
Oh yeah! Especially
if I finish this book by then.

114
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,986
Oh, I love this show!

115
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,691
<i>The 10 best air crashes of all time!</i>

116
00:06:35,716 --> 00:06:36,799
What the...

117
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,785
- Not good.
- How does that happen?

118
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,170
That is not going to buff out.

119
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,589
You know, this might not cover
everything you could run into out there.

120
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,604
- What are you getting at?
- I don't know.

121
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,287
I'm just wondering if maybe
we need some help.

122
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,286
Help? From who?

123
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,283
Well, like the Skipper.

124
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,481
That old Corsair
down at the end of the runway?

125
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,522
- Sure, he's a war hero.
- He's an old crankshaft.

126
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,270
My buddy, Sparky, he says the Skipper

127
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,066
was a legendary
flight instructor in the navy.

128
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,869
That's right. He knows stuff.

129
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,271
He's been grounded for decades.

130
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,965
Why would I want to be coached
by a plane who doesn't even fly?

131
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,690
At least he's a plane.

132
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,445
<i>The number one crash of all time...</i>

133
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,601
Oh, man!

134
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,727
<i>I'm okay.</i>

135
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,921
<i>That's got to hurt.</i>

136
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,726
They say he shot down 50 planes.

137
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,988
I heard stories about his squadron,
the Jolly Wrenches.

138
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:36,599
Hmm-hm.

139
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,047
They were the roughest, toughest,
meanest flyers in the navy.

140
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,931
Ruthless killers who showed no mercy.

141
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,168
- Wait, so...
- No mercy!

142
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,770
They would shoot you
as soon as look at you.

143
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,402
I hope you're right about this.

144
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,401
Chug!

145
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,926
I'll wait here.

146
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,927
Hey, there, Skipper.

147
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,165
Say, I'm trying out for
the Wings Around the Globe Rally.

148
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,483
And I know you can't fly anymore.

149
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,766
But, ah, you know, they say,
"Those who can't do, teach."

150
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,968
So...

151
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,163
Okay, what I mean to say is,
you're not a truck.

152
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,067
So, I was wondering
if you would train me?

153
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,331
Go on, he's warming up to you.

154
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,406
So, I heard you shot down 50 planes.

155
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,364
You looking to be number 51?

156
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,443
No.

157
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,801
No, no, no! Wait, wait.

158
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,969
I just... I figured,
with my guts and your glory...

159
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,487
Your guts would be a grease spot
on a runway somewhere.

160
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,088
Go home. You're in over your head, kid.

161
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,149
Look, you flew all those...

162
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,961
Let's try the back door.

163
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,221
Hello, Lincoln! Hey, Dusty!

164
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,665
I don't know how
you talked me into coming to this.

165
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,821
Now, come on, Dottie.

166
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,746
Wow! I don't believe it. A Red Tail P-51!

167
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,902
Oh, man! A Sea Fury!

168
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,582
Check it out!

169
00:09:28,507 --> 00:09:30,207
Wow!

170
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,141
<i>Ladies and gentleplanes.</i>

171
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,308
<i>May we have your attention, please?</i>

172
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,940
<i>Kindly direct your windscreens
to the heavens above</i>

173
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,423
<i>and give a warm welcome
to our special guest.</i>

174
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,628
<i>The Prince of Propellers.</i>

175
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,723
<i>When he's speeding, he's the leading.</i>

176
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,265
Get my good side, fellas.

177
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,465
<i>When he's grinning, he's winning.</i>

178
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,021
<i>The one and only...</i>

179
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,626
Ripslinger!

180
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,788
You're caught in the riptide!

181
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,749
Thanks for coming out.

182
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,141
Who wants a picture?
All right, one at a time.

183
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,190
Well, with all that self-promotion,
at least he's modest.

184
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,468
Dottie, that's Ripslinger.

185
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,544
He's captain of Team RPX.
They call him...

186
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,543
- The Green Tornado.
- The Green Tornado.

187
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,351
He's so good, he's pre-qualified.

188
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,704
Oh, and those two, Ned and Zed.

189
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,787
- The Twin Turbos.
- The Twin Turbos.

190
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,191
They're world-class racers.

191
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:28,221
You know, I hear they used to be
one plane and were separated at birth.

192
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,589
Wow. I wish I was separated at birth.

193
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,981
<i>Okay, people.</i>

194
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,064
<i>This is the last of four time trials
being held worldwide.</i>

195
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,723
<i>Today's qualifying round
is one lap around the pylons.</i>

196
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,382
<i>The top five finishers will qualify
for the Wings Around the Globe Rally.</i>

197
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,581
<i>Oh yeah.</i>

198
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,504
<i>Fonzarelli, you're up, my man.</i>

199
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,868
<i>Oh, man! That's nasty.</i>

200
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,261
<i>And he's through the start gate!</i>

201
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,866
<i>The racers must pass through
the blue pylons on the horizontal</i>

202
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,387
<i>and around the red pylons
on the knife-edge.</i>

203
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,062
<i>Now he's coming back to Gate Three!</i>

204
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,944
<i>Nicely done, my man.</i>

205
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,263
<i>Setting himself up a little high
through the blue pylons there,</i>

206
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,341
<i>lining up for the quadro.</i>

207
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,942
<i>He's taking a hard right with a
270-degree high-G turn! Oh yeah!</i>

208
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,023
<i>Back all the way around.</i>

209
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,229
<i>- Cleanly through. Look at you, man!</i>
- That guy's good.

210
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,867
<i>It doesn't get much better than that.
All right. Good speed.</i>

211
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,024
<i>Lining up for the three-pylon chicane,
amazing pitch control.</i>

212
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,284
<i>Smooth! Fast! Clean!</i>

213
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,546
<i>He's going into the final turn</i>

214
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,749
<i>into the half-Cuban 8,
pulling an aggressive 9.2 Gs.</i>

215
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,550
<i>Attacking the climb!</i>

216
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,031
<i>Wow. Now that's some speed.</i>

217
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,067
<i>Coming out of the Cuban 8 at
the end of a fantastic first run, people.</i>

218
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,101
<i>A 01.24.16.</i>

219
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,421
<i>A very good time for
the other racers to try and beat.</i>

220
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,388
<i>Fast, tight through the pylons.</i>

221
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,065
<i>He's got a great pace going, here.</i>

222
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,750
<i>He's just a half a second behind.</i>

223
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,584
<i>Ow. Engine failure!</i>

224
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,185
<i>Out of the race. Bye-bye.</i>

225
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,986
<i>Great performance.
Watch the clock here.</i>

226
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,744
<i>I can't wait. Lining up for the Blue Gate.</i>

227
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,107
<i>Oh, no, he did not!
That's a major penalty.</i>

228
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,348
<i>Sorry, dude. Eighth place.</i>

229
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,910
<i>Talk about fast.</i>

230
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,347
<i>Coming out the Cuban 8.
Whoo!</i>

231
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,745
Fueled and ready, man.

232
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,743
Okay, bud, you're up.

233
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,911
Good and tight.

234
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,660
<i>- It's been a wonderful day here,</i>
- All set.

235
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,151
<i>and we're down to our last competitor.</i>

236
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,671
This is it.

237
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,267
<i>From Propwash Junction,
Strut Jetstream.</i>

238
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,070
"Strut Jetstream"?

239
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,065
Yep. Awesomest call sign ever.
It was my idea.

240
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,747
- Ah, that explains it.
<i>- Hey, ag-plane!</i>

241
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,830
<i>Landscaping was yesterday, man.
Get off the runway. We're racing, here.</i>

242
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,988
<i>- Second call for Strut Jetstream.</i>
- No, no, no!

243
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,711
<i>- Looking for...</i>
- Yo! I'm Strut Jetstream.

244
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,111
<i>- You are Strut Jetstream?</i>
- Yep.

245
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,620
<i>A crop duster'?
Man, what's going on here?</i>

246
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,707
<i>Is everybody getting to fly today?</i>

247
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,987
<i>Man, your momma must have
had high hopes for you.</i>

248
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,428
<i>Now, you know you are
built for seed, not speed.</i>

249
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,786
You have got to be kidding me.

250
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,385
That farmer's going to race?

251
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,667
Seriously, with a prop that small?

252
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,345
Maybe he races that leaky,

253
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,901
old fuel truck next to him.

254
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,066
Who are you calling leaky?

255
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,188
I'll leak on you,
if you don't check your intake.

256
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,229
Don't lower yourself to their level.

257
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,701
Go on Dust... Go on, Strut.

258
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,631
Who's that guy?

259
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,500
- You're going to try out?
- A crop duster?

260
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,031
Cornfield is over that way.

261
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,222
Nice of you to take the day off
just to lose!

262
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,060
Go, Duster!

263
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,589
<i>It's going to be a tall order for him
to knock Fonzarelli out of fifth place.</i>

264
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,226
<i>And he's off!</i>

265
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,861
<i>Well, he's starting a little conservative.</i>

266
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,981
- This ought to be rich.
<i>- 193 miles per hour.</i>

267
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,780
<i>He's into Gate Two,
clean through the horizontal.</i>

268
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,665
<i>What?
He's practically mowing the lawn.</i>

269
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,821
<i>Come to my house, man.</i>

270
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,530
<i>Okay. At the first split,
he's a full second behind Fonzarelli.</i>

271
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,465
<i>Yo, that's a lot of time to make up,
but this guy's aggressive.</i>

272
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,986
<i>Now he's making that hard
270-degree high-G turn!</i>

273
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,306
That's it!

274
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,950
<i>Setting himself up. Left vertical turn.</i>

275
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,943
<i>Lining up for the three-pylon chicane.</i>

276
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,181
<i>He's gaining speed.</i>

277
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,342
<i>Now, he's only half a second
behind Fonzarelli.</i>

278
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,821
<i>And he is closing rapidly.</i>

279
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,024
<i>Now he's back on that stick.
Up he goes! Up and away!</i>

280
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,000
<i>Now only two-tenths of
a second behind Fonzarelli!</i>

281
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,108
- Come on, Duster!
<i>- It's going to be close.</i>

282
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,864
He's going to do it. He's going to do it.

283
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,842
<i>Oh yes! What a finish!
Now, that's what you call flying!</i>

284
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,190
Way to go, Dustmeister.

285
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,430
That's what I'm talking about.

286
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,907
<i>Jetstream, the official time is</i>

287
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,542
<i>1 minute, 24.26 seconds.</i>

288
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,421
<i>Sixth place,
but what a close one, people.</i>

289
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,540
<i>Well, folks, that wraps up the trials
for the Wings Around...</i>

290
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,982
Hey, pal, sixth place
ain't nothing to be ashamed of.

291
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,824
That was a heck of a run.

292
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,660
Thanks.

293
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,511
Ow. Dagnabbit! Let me drive!

294
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,186
There you go, topped off
and all set, Mayday.

295
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,184
Will you stop! Ow!
Unbelievable!

296
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,341
Why don't you just go back!

297
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,822
I mean, I think you actually
missed a pothole!

298
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,910
Man, you got to be the worst,

299
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,921
I mean the worst delivery truck
that has ever delivered a delivery!

300
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,226
Can I help you?

301
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,330
Please tell me
this is Propwash Junction.

302
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,147
Sure is.

303
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,190
Oh, finally. You know,
you're not even on the map.

304
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,263
Yeah, pretty drive though, ain't it?

305
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,747
Yeah. Especially if you
like looking at dirt and corn.

306
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,790
Anyway,
I'm looking for a Strut Jetstream.

307
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,910
- Who?
- Jetstream. Strut Jetstream.

308
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,501
Nope, doesn't ring a bell.
Do you have a photo?

309
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,708
Yeah, I got one right here.
No, I don't have a photo!

310
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,906
I have documentation that says

311
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,251
Strut Jetstream
lives in Propwash Junction.

312
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,207
Wait a minute! Okay!

313
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,545
No, gosh I...

314
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,464
Hey, I'm Strut Jetstream.

315
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,100
Oh yeah! That's right!

316
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,184
I knew I'd remember.
There he is, strutting on over here.

317
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,911
But you're mispronouncing it slightly.

318
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,300
- I am?
- Yeah.

319
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,581
It's actually pronounced
"Dusty Crophopper."

320
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,628
Dusty Crophopper.

321
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,301
Yeah. It's Scandinavian.

322
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,783
Right, and I'm Egyptian.

323
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,701
Googly moogly! What is that smell?

324
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,748
- It's Vita-minamulch.
- Vita-mina-what?

325
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,551
The finest-smelling compost
this side of the Mississippi.

326
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,782
Original, creamy and chunky style.

327
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,022
Yeah. Smell that?
Hmm. It's like daffodils

328
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,501
and like Sunday dinner.
I just love it. I love it.

329
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:34,029
<i>I got some minamulch, yeah!
I got some minamulch, yeah!</i>

330
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,461
That old airplane needs some help.
Y'all know that, right?

331
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,701
Yeah.

332
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,300
Are you familiar with
the racing fuel additive, nitro methane?

333
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,661
Yeah! Zip juice! Go-go punch!

334
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,947
That stuff will blur your vision
and slur your speech.

335
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,181
- It's illegal.
- Totally illegal.

336
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,627
Wouldn't know what it looks like.
Yeah, you were saying?

337
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,591
That substance was found in the tank
of the fifth-place qualifier, Fonzarelli.

338
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,140
Illegal fuel intake is an automatic DQ.

339
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,542
Wait, so you're saying...

340
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,471
He's out, you're in. Congratulations.

341
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,030
You're in?

342
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,110
He's in!

343
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,023
You're never going to believe this.
He's in!

344
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,467
Dusty's in the race! Dottie, he's in!

345
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,190
What? Are you serious?

346
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,421
Dusty.

347
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,424
- Don't do anything crazy. Fly safe.
- Man, it's going to be cool.

348
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,186
You're going to cross oceans
thousands of miles wide.

349
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,183
Freezing your rudder off one day...

350
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,422
- And burning it off the next!
- Freaking hurricanes.

351
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,746
- Cyclones!
- Typhoons!

352
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,345
- Monsoons!
- Tornadoes!

353
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,990
- Sandstorms!
- Gale force winds!

354
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,186
Yeah!

355
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,565
Bad idea.

356
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,064
You'll end up a smoking hole
on the side of a mountain

357
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,148
with your parts
spread over five countries.

358
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,426
What makes you say that?

359
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,907
You're going up against
the best racers in the world.

360
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,630
And some of them don't even finish.

361
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,066
You're sloppy on your rolls,

362
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,722
wide on your turns,
slow on your straightaways.

363
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,668
You've been watching me?

364
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,629
Yeah, watching you
make a fool out of yourself.

365
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,261
You need to be tighter getting
in and out of your knife-edge.

366
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,330
- Okay. - Any extra control input
costs you speed and seconds.

367
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,669
- So, you think I'm overcorrecting?
- Absolutely. Rookie mistake.

368
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,470
Are you giving me pointers?

369
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,470
No! I'm telling you to forget
all this racing malarkey.

370
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,191
You just ain't built for it.
You're a crop duster!

371
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,827
You don't think I know that?

372
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,187
I'm the one who's been
flying back and forth

373
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:25,750
across the same fields day after day,
month after month, for years!

374
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,408
I have flown thousands of miles

375
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,464
and I have never been anywhere.

376
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,187
Not like you.

377
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,542
You were built to fight,
and look what you did!

378
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,704
You're a hero.

379
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:45,270
I'm just trying to prove
that maybe, just maybe,

380
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,071
I can do more than what I was built for.

381
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,509
You know what? Just forget it.

382
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,188
You'll never understand.

383
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,306
0500, tomorrow. Don't be late.

384
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,303
Wait. 0500?

385
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,862
Yeah, 5:00 a.m.

386
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,103
Sparky, binoculars.

387
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,788
Those are some
mighty clean optics, there.

388
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,340
What do you use?
Some kind of shammy?

389
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,781
- No, no, it's a special microfiber cloth.
- Microfiber.

390
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,466
Yeah, lint-free, scratch-free.
<i>I'll get you some.</i>

391
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,020
I got an ex-Navy buddy
who sells them to me wholesale.

392
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,181
I helped him set up his web...

393
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,741
Knock it off.
We got a lot of work to do.

394
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,188
- I'll hook you up.
- Thanks.

395
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,621
All right, Dusty, remember this.

396
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,186
It ain't how fast you fly,
<i>it's how you fly fast.</i>

397
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,701
- Roger that.
<i>- Show me what you got.</i>

398
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,228
Watch this! Oh yeah.

399
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,549
<i>Great, you can go up and down.
What else?</i>

400
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,105
<i>- Show me your turns.</i>
- Here we go!

401
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,985
<i>You think that was good? That stunk!
Knife-edge those elm trees.</i>

402
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,069
Come on. Keep your nose up!

403
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,063
Hey, Skip.

404
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,824
- You want speed, right?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

405
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,982
- Serious, bolt-rattling speed?
- Yeah!

406
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,222
<i>Then look up.
Do you see those clouds?</i>

407
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,950
<i>The highway in the sky.</i>

408
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,944
<i>Tailwinds like nothing
you've ever flown.</i>

409
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,943
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

410
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,228
<i>Come on, power up. Firewall thrust.</i>

411
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,223
<i>Max torque, max torque!</i>

412
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,745
<i>All right, looking good.</i>

413
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,022
<i>Hold V-Y, Dusty. Max rate, now.</i>

414
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,271
<i>Your nose is too high.
Get your nose down.</i>

415
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,228
<i>You're going to stall.
Ease off the pitch. Nose down!</i>

416
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,905
Hey, what are you doing?

417
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,687
What just happened up there?

418
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,584
I'm... I'm low on fuel.

419
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,126
Do I look like I was built yesterday?

420
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,066
- No, no. It's a long story.
- I got time.

421
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,225
Okay, well, you know,

422
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,144
I feel like I was having some problems
with my axial compressor so...

423
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,191
The Jolly Wrenches have a motto:
<i>Volo Pro Veritas.</i>

424
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,786
It means "I fly for truth."

425
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,945
Clearly, you don't.

426
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,301
Sparky, push me back to the hangar.

427
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,749
I'm afraid of heights.

428
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,510
- But you're a plane.
- I'm a crop duster.

429
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,827
I've never flown over a thousand feet.

430
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,510
Are you kiddin'?

431
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,584
Scared of heights and you want to
race around the world?

432
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,465
Skip, during the attack of
Tujunga Harbor

433
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,140
why, even the P-38s
had trouble at high altitudes.

434
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,270
Well, they didn't have to fly
over the Himalayas, did they?

435
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,980
I'll still be low to the ground,
just high up.

436
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,660
And after the war,
those 38s went on to win races.

437
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,986
Really? Is that true?

438
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,421
Yeah, true.
Like in the Cleveland race of '46.

439
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,309
- For real?
- Wait, it gets better.

440
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,306
In '49, the P-38 Sky Ranger
averaged 337 miles per hour.

441
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,541
Wait, 337?

442
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,704
Well, actually 337.4, but they
round it down in the record books.

443
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,767
Why would you do that?

444
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,451
Some people just have
no respect for decimal points.

445
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,747
- Yeah, I know. Tell me about it.
- I mean, why couldn't they round it up?

446
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,346
- Seriously, he...
- All right, all right.

447
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,543
So, you're a flat-hatter.
We'll work on that.

448
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,421
But for now let's see if we can turn
low and sloppy into low and fast.

449
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,031
Roger that.

450
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,300
It'll go like this.

451
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,749
<i>The flag marks the start line.</i>

452
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,266
<i>Across the cornfield,
three silos are waiting for you.</i>

453
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,785
<i>Slalom those with a radial-G pass.</i>

454
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,100
<i>Wait. "A radial" what pass?</i>

455
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,261
<i>Once you get to the trees,</i>

456
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,951
<i>go to your optimal rate of climb
to about 500 feet.</i>

457
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,069
<i>Roll inverted and extend,
trading altitude for air speed</i>

458
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,541
<i>- and dive toward the finish line.</i>
- Okay.

459
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,305
You string all that together,
you might have a chance to beat him.

460
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,381
Who am I racing?

461
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,181
Here he comes.

462
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,230
He's a twin commuter
pushing about 1500 horsepower.

463
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,986
<i>He's pretty high up.</i>

464
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,029
<i>You're not racing him,
you're racing his shadow.</i>

465
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,746
<i>Beat it to the water tower.</i>

466
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,868
<i>Let's do this! Thread the silos!</i>

467
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,623
<i>Tighter! Lean into your turns more.</i>

468
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,984
- His turns are terrible.
- Yeah.

469
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,731
<i>Let's go, Dusty. Faster.</i>

470
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,181
You're falling behind.

471
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,627
<i>Begin your climb
and catch him in the dive.</i>

472
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,908
<i>Start your dive now.</i>

473
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,222
Never mind, you already lost.

474
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,747
So, we can increase power
or we can decrease drag.

475
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,149
Definitely increase power.

476
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,585
More torque means more speed.

477
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,211
Lousy.

478
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,522
<i>Come on, let's work that radial-G turn.</i>

479
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,266
<i>Do it again. One more time. Again!</i>

480
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,381
<i>Come on! Push it, Dusty!</i>

481
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,021
Better!

482
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,784
<i>Remember now, altitude for airspeed.</i>

483
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,941
<i>Gravity is your ally.</i>

484
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,062
<i>The laws of physics govern speed.</i>

485
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,622
All right, Dusty.
<i>Give this run all you've got.</i>

486
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,430
<i>Use your radial-G.</i>

487
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,211
<i>Let gravity work for you.</i>

488
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,508
<i>Looking good.
That's what I'm talking about.</i>

489
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,987
<i>Firewall the throttle! Go! Go! Go!</i>

490
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,670
You got it, Duster!

491
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,860
<i>Begin your climb!</i>

492
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,949
<i>All right, altitude for airspeed.</i>

493
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,351
<i>Catch him in the dive!</i>

494
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,264
<i>Dive now!</i>

495
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,549
Ballistic!

496
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,508
<i>He kicked Aston Martins out there!</i>

497
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,868
- Dusterino!
- He's ready.

498
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,229
- Whoa!
- That's cool.

499
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,463
The piston and cross-wrenches.
Your squadron insignia.

500
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,746
- You've earned it.
- It fits you.

501
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,703
- It fits you, Dusty.
- Now, listen.

502
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,769
When the race starts and
all those planes take off,

503
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,703
it'll stir up a bunch of swirlies

504
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,221
just like the Wrenches ran into
in the Battle of Airway.

505
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,661
Roger that. Sure wish
you were coming with me, Skip.

506
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,300
Just radio back when
you get to the check points.

507
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,349
I'll be your wingman from here.

508
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,423
<i>Volo Pro Veritas</i>, right?

509
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,662
<i>Volo Pro Veritas.</i>

510
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,828
- Kick some tail, buddy.
- We're all proud of you.

511
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,711
Who-hoo! Dustmeister!

512
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,026
Wow.

513
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,467
<i>Break, break.</i>

514
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,190
<i>Air racer number 7, Air racer number 7.</i>

515
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,388
<i>Do you read? Kennedy approach, over.</i>

516
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,181
I'm Dusty Crophopper,
I'm looking for JFK airport.

517
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,660
<i>Crophopper 7, you are supposed
to be on the Carnice visual.</i>

518
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,424
<i>Turn further left, heading 1-9-5.</i>

519
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,550
<i>Maintain 1,000 feet.
Intercept the 22 right localizer.</i>

520
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,541
<i>You are cleared for
the ILS 22, right approach.</i>

521
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,708
- Roger.
<i>- Heavy is sectored in behind you.</i>

522
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,941
Run that by me one more time.

523
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,990
<i>Turn further left,
heading 1-9-5. Maintain...</i>

524
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,207
Never mind. I got it.

525
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,381
Do you see him?

526
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,789
Well, radar does, but I don't see diddly.

527
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:57,229
Check out this pavement!
Nice! It's so smooth.

528
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,105
<i>Crophopper 7, you passed Foxtrot.
Turn left onto Charlie.</i>

529
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,261
<i>Hold short at 22.</i>

530
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,224
Wait, I thought...

531
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,791
<i>Get off the runway!</i>

532
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,070
- Oh. Sorry.
- Go back to Jersey, you bum.

533
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,301
Excuse me, where can I...

534
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,622
Hey-ho, do you mind? I'm working here.

535
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,861
Sorry.

536
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,547
A nice enough guy, but way too much
baggage, if you know what I mean.

537
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,061
Hey, there. I'm looking for pit row.

538
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,949
The pits? Yeah, that's easy.

539
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,467
You want to go down this way
toward the fire station.

540
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,266
Then taxiway alpha forks off to the left.

541
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,582
But don't go that way.
You want to veer right.

542
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,630
And if you get to the orange barrels,
you went too far. So...

543
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,623
Just go straight ahead and to the right.

544
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:41,102
Great, thanks.
Hey, nice paint job.

545
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,621
Well, thank you!
I'm kind of proud of it.

546
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,306
- I think he was talking to me.
- Oh.

547
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,026
Well, looky who's here.
The Scandinavian.

548
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,029
- Hey.
- Miss your home town?

549
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,587
I don't. Just about blocked
that memory out of my mind.

550
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,264
But you're bringing it
right back with that...

551
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,540
Oh, man, that nasty
Vita-mina-stink-a-bunch.

552
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,548
Your tent's the last one on the left. Go!

553
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,110
Okay.

554
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,184
Power wash is on the right.
Just saying.

555
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,905
Wow! Bulldog?
From the European Cup? The Big Dog!

556
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,029
Hey, I saw you do this unbelievable
high-G vertical turn.

557
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,141
How did you do that?

558
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,631
Well, let me tell you.

559
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,341
In fact, why don't I tell you
all my racing secrets?

560
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,344
- Really?
- No.

561
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,104
Look, I don't know how things work

562
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,500
in the backwater
from which you hail, matey,

563
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,350
but this is a competition.

564
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,504
Every plane for himself!
Goodbye.

565
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,344
Yeah, sure.

566
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:37,369
I didn't...

567
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,267
Wait a second. This is AeroShell 100.

568
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,741
I thought I ordered the DT-2380.

569
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,902
Well, I am sorry you had to see that.

570
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,944
- Are you all right?
- Sure. Why wouldn't I be?

571
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,901
And you are Pan-Asian Champion
and Mumbai Cup record holder, Ishani.

572
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,142
Most people call me just "Ishani."

573
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,700
I'm Dusty.
I mean my name is Dusty.

574
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,710
I'm not actually dusty, I'm quite clean.

575
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:06,990
It's very nice to meet you,
"quite clean" Dusty.

576
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,970
Nice to meet you, too.

577
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,863
Look at that propeller.

578
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,542
A little over there.
Not so much pressure, okay?

579
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,862
Excuse me, guys. Pardon me.

580
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,211
Yeah.

581
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,171
Hey, look who made it!

582
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,870
- It's the crop duster.
- Hey.

583
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,626
You know, having you here
is a nice vehicle-interest story.

584
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,842
Small-town farmer
makes it to the big time.

585
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,026
Yes, sir.

586
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,262
- But tragically crashes on takeoff.
- What?

587
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,950
Wings Around The Globe winner,
Ripslinger,

588
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,309
eulogizes the unknown hayseed
and scatters his debris over a cornfield.

589
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,070
Ratings will be through the roof!

590
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,029
- Okay.
- Good luck.

591
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,902
- Farm boy.
- What?

592
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,065
The hero of the people has arrived.

593
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,462
You have never heard
of the great <i>El Chupacabra</i>?

594
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,623
Hey, isn't that that monster
that siphons fuel from small vehicles?

595
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,302
No, no, no, it's just a stage name

596
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,946
designed to strike fear
into the hearts of my opponents.

597
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,230
Yeah, he's the indoor racing
champion of all Mexico.

598
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,381
Indoor racing?

599
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:19,765
And <i>numero uno</i> recording artist,
<i>telenovela</i> star and romance novelist.

600
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,966
Did you say El Chupacabra
or El Cuckoo-cabra?

601
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:27,746
You make joke?
You make joke?

602
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,869
Very well. You leave me no choice!

603
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,626
I swish my cape at you!

604
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,144
You have been shamed.

605
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,988
I hope I can get over it.

606
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,461
I just did!

607
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,982
Hey, I saw you race
on Telemoto last year.

608
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,267
Of course, it was in Spanish,
so I didn't understand everything.

609
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,183
I am flattered, <i>avion pequeno.</i>

610
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,866
You have done many of these
long distance rallies, yes?

611
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,910
- No, this is my first one.
- It is my first time, as well!

612
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,187
We will have many adventures,
you and I.

613
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,310
We will laugh, we will cry,
we will dance!

614
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:04,114
Uhm, wow.

615
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,268
- Probably not with each other.
- Of course.

616
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,462
I will see you in the skies, <i>amigo.</i>

617
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,263
<i>Race fans, it's that time of year again.</i>

618
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,991
<i>Welcome to the
Wings Around The Globe.</i>

619
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,383
Hello, I'm Brent Mustangburger,

620
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,623
and this is the flagship event
of the world's fastest sport

621
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,987
where only the best
of the best compete.

622
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,666
<i>Each leg brings a new challenge,</i>

623
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:31,546
<i>testing agility, navigation
and endurance.</i>

624
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:35,831
But when it's all said and done,
speed is the name of the game.

625
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,750
Our very own Colin Cowling

626
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,870
is standing by live from JFK airport
with the best seat in the house.

627
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,431
How's the view, big guy?

628
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,426
Brent, the scene below me
is absolutely electric.

629
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,071
As you know, we have racers
from all over the world, here.

630
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,985
But the real story should be
who's coming in second

631
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,223
to three-time defending champ,
Ripslinger,

632
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,350
who is seeking to become
the first <i>four-time winner</i>

633
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,911
<i>in the Wings Around The Globe.</i>

634
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,142
<i>The racers
are making their way to the runway.</i>

635
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,001
It's Dusty!

636
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,149
All right, everybody,
get your Dusty bobbleheads.

637
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,905
Your oven mitts, hats, bumper stickers,

638
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,223
and I also ordered a thousand
commemorative whistles.

639
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,350
Hey, you think you can help me
set up a website?

640
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,645
Does a giga bite?

641
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,708
Well, not if you pet him nicely.

642
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,426
Dusty!

643
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,981
<i>One-hundred and thirty-six nations
compete.</i>

644
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,108
<i>Twenty-one planes selected.</i>

645
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,860
<i>Folks, a step onto this field,
is a step into history.</i>

646
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,582
Holy smokes!

647
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:51,941
And for the first time ever, folks,
<i>we have a crop duster in the race.</i>

648
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,222
A crop duster?

649
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,586
Well, he's gonna die.

650
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,624
Ripslinger! Ripslinger!

651
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,626
Ripslinger! Ripslinger! Ripslinger!

652
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,030
Yeah. You're caught in the riptide!

653
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,462
Wow. Look at this crowd.

654
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:23,261
Stay focused, <i>amigo</i>.
Don't let anything distract you.

655
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,223
Who is that vision?

656
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,244
That's Rochelle,
the Canadian rally champ.

657
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,346
She is like an angel, sent from heaven.

658
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,861
Like a sunrise
after a lifetime of darkness.

659
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,046
Like fresh fertilizer
on a field of dying grass.

660
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,822
This is not your thing, my friend.

661
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,948
<i>All right, racers.</i>

662
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,541
<i>Start your engines!</i>

663
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,620
<i>Seven legs, over 31,000 kilometers,</i>

664
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,863
<i>the world's highest mountains,
and the deepest oceans</i>

665
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,226
<i>all stand before them</i>

666
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:18,465
<i>just waiting to be conquered
by the right competitor.</i>

667
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,428
Here we go. Oh, boy!

668
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,906
<i>All the preparation.</i>

669
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,944
<i>It all comes down to this moment.</i>

670
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,827
<i>One of these planes is about to fly off
into the pages of sports history</i>

671
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,948
<i>and become a champion.</i>

672
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,041
Go!

673
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,702
<i>And we are under way!</i>

674
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,425
Swirlies!

675
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,390
<i>Our first stage is a Whopper.</i>

676
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,224
<i>A dead sprint across the North Atlantic.</i>

677
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,985
<i>That's right, Brent.
This is how it works, folks.</i>

678
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,707
<i>The winner of the leg today
is the first to take off tomorrow.</i>

679
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:09,622
Hey, look who's finally here!
It's that low-flying farmer boy!

680
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,505
You do know this is a race, right?

681
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,441
That's a good one, boss.

682
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,702
Excuse me, how much does
a snow plow weigh?

683
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,331
<i>Je ne sais pas.</i> I do not know.

684
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,987
Enough to break the ice.
I am El Chupacabra.

685
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,462
- Ah,you are the snow plow, <i>oui</i>?
- You could say that, yes.

686
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,903
- And I am the ice?
- Yes.

687
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,685
Cold, frozen and lifeless?

688
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,027
No, I... It sounds better in Spanish.

689
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,831
Why don't you go plow yourself,
El Chu-toy?

690
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,741
She is like an angel.

691
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,991
<i>This is Propwash Junction
to Dusty Crophopper.</i>

692
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,061
I read you, Chug.

693
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,547
<i>So what's it like
racing with the big dogs, Duster?</i>

694
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,630
- Well, my wings froze solid.
<i>- Man!</i>

695
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,828
- I had icicles hanging off my sprayer.
<i>- All right!</i>

696
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,426
And I nearly smashed
into a 10-story iceberg.

697
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,661
<i>Awesome!</i>

698
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,980
<i>Yeah, "awesome" is not quite
the word that I would use</i>

699
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,869
<i>to describe a gruesome
near-death experience.</i>

700
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,101
You hang in there, buddy.

701
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,503
There's nothing better than
<i>dying while doing what you love most.</i>

702
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,702
<i>That's gonna make him feel
a lot better.</i>

703
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,102
<i>Dusty</i>, just like when
the Jolly Wrenches

704
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,101
were up in the Aleutians

705
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,706
the air down close to the sea
has more moisture,

706
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,350
which is why you took on ice.

707
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,862
<i>- You gotta try to fly higher.</i>
- Great.

708
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,066
<i>The good news is</i>

709
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,905
<i>tomorrow's leg goes through
the Bavarian obstacle course.</i>

710
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,303
<i>It's all about agility,
so it's your chance to move up.</i>

711
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,743
<i>And remember, it's not speed
that wins races, it's skill.</i>

712
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,111
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
I'm blinded. I can't see.</i>

713
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,741
We're receiving breaking news

714
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,985
of an incident in the skies over
Germany involving one of the racers.

715
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,586
Let's check in with Skycam 1
for more information.

716
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,047
Bulldog, the legendary flyer
from the UK,

717
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,990
<i>is in tremendous danger.</i>

718
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,987
<i>It looks like he's flying blind,
losing speed, losing altitude...</i>

719
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,791
<i>Wait! It's Racer Number 7, Crophopper,</i>

720
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,540
<i>- pulling up beside him.</i>
- What's he doing?

721
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,226
- Bulldog, apply your left aileron.
- Okay.

722
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,301
Stop roll.

723
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,666
- Now, quick, pull up.
- Got it.

724
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,821
Harder, harder!

725
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,068
Slight roll right. Good!

726
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,583
Wow! Big castle!
Pull up! Hard roll right!

727
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,827
Stop roll.

728
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,906
Are you still there?

729
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,169
I'm right here.
I'll fly right alongside you.

730
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,104
<i>Achtung! We have a mayday!
Clear the runway!</i>

731
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,103
<i>Achtung! Clear the runway!</i>

732
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,625
- Add power.
- Okay.

733
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,827
- Easy, now.
- Yes.

734
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,462
Good. Flaps down, lock 'em.

735
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,066
Careful.

736
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,227
Landing gear down.

737
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,581
Yeah, and locked.

738
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,145
Begin your flare.

739
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,785
Power back a little.

740
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,990
Touchdown! Nicely done!

741
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,350
Thanks for your help, matey.

742
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,901
I couldn't have done it without...

743
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,824
You? You saved me?

744
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,626
What did I tell you, boy?
Every plane for himself, right?

745
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,190
Where I come from, if you see someone
falling from the sky...

746
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,266
Yes, but this is a competition.
Now, you're dead last.

747
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,906
And I owe you my life.

748
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,381
Are you crying?

749
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,662
I don't cry, I'm British!

750
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,505
Thanks, matey.

751
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,823
Sure thing, Bulldog.

752
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,670
Bulldog! Bulldog!

753
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,706
Well, I got to say, crop duster,
you are a nice guy.

754
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,941
Hey. Thanks, Rip.

755
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,341
And we all know where nice guys finish.

756
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,184
Yeah!

757
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,107
Dead last.

758
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:59,182
You sad, you drink.

759
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,025
Thanks. Great advice.

760
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:05,548
At least you are not last
in the race for love.

761
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,861
Rochelle?

762
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:12,060
Her passion is, sadly, not for me.

763
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,742
Tough break, El Chu.

764
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,781
Excuse me.

765
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:20,546
My name is Franz, and I am a huge fan.

766
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:24,022
- I have fans?
- No, no, no. Just me.

767
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:28,947
And I would like to say <i>danke</i>
for representing all us little planes.

768
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,300
You're a car.

769
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:35,027
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I am
what you call a Flugzeugauto,

770
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,070
one of only six flying cars ever built!

771
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,983
- Wow.
<i>- Guten Tag, Herr</i> Dusty.

772
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,188
I am Von Fliegenhozen.

773
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,981
Didn't you just say
your name was Franz?

774
00:39:51,982 --> 00:39:53,274
<i>Nein, nein, nein.</i>

775
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,268
Franz is a guy with no spine

776
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,264
who is in charge
when we putter about the cobblestones.

777
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,184
In the air, I am in charge.

778
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,743
This guy needs to
get his head gasket checked.

779
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,585
Serious identity issues.

780
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,989
This from the one wearing a mask?

781
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,351
<i>Touché.</i>

782
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,140
We are both pulling for you, <i>Herr</i> Dusty.

783
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,901
Thanks for the support.
I need all the help I can get.

784
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,866
And I have a humble suggestion.

785
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,624
Would you not be much faster

786
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,829
without the pipes and tank
and whatnot weighing you down?

787
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,411
My Sprayer. Again?

788
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,946
Yeah.
Why carry around the extra weight?

789
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,705
The little crazy car is right.

790
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,851
Perhaps you need to start
thinking like a racer.

791
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,544
This is reversible, right?

792
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,021
Hey, you're being
careful down there, right?

793
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,465
Yep, that's cold.

794
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,782
So?

795
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,644
So, what do you think?

796
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,507
<i>Wunderbar</i>, Dusty.

797
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,871
It is freeing, yes?

798
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,301
Yeah, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

799
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,390
Bye-bye, sprayer!

800
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,066
Thanks for everything, Franz...
Von Fliegenhozen.

801
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,904
<i>Guten</i> luck, <i>Herr</i> Dusty.

802
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,148
<i>It's our third leg</i>

803
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,861
<i>and we've already lost several
competitors to equipment failure.</i>

804
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,830
<i>But the real story here, Brent,
is Dusty Crophopper.</i>

805
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,027
Absolutely.

806
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,886
<i>He's passing one flier after another.</i>

807
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,745
<i>That's right. This guy
was built to dust crops,</i>

808
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,028
<i>but he's dusting the competition.</i>

809
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,883
<i>What's next, Colin?</i>

810
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,345
<i>Brent, this could be Crophopper's leg,
all the way.</i>

811
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,304
<i>The racers will have to fly
under a hard ceiling of 1,000 feet.</i>

812
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,224
<i>Stay under the clouds and in the hills.</i>

813
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,785
Number 20 is disqualified.

814
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,984
<i>- What a move.
- Incredible.</i>

815
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,731
<i>Look at that radial-G pass.</i>

816
00:41:44,757 --> 00:41:45,406
Yeah!

817
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,980
<i>From last place,
all the way up to eighth.</i>

818
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,307
<i>Mr. Ripslinger,
you were built for racing.</i>

819
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,541
<i>Yeah! You know it.</i>

820
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,723
<i>So how can a crop duster out-fly you?</i>

821
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,841
<i>- Wait, what?
- There he is! Dusty!</i>

822
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,064
<i>How do you
keep up with the pros?</i>

823
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,381
<i>Did working on the farm
make you stronger?</i>

824
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,110
<i>Dusty, Dusty!
Why do you fly so low?</i>

825
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,542
Why are they wasting their time
with him?

826
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,624
He's a tractor with wings.

827
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,466
Actually, it's a really
compelling underdog story.

828
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,541
It's like <i>Rocky.</i>

829
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,841
It's more like <i>David and Goliath</i>.

830
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,546
Or <i>Old Yeller</i>.

831
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,605
- That's not an underdog story.
- Well, there's a dog in it.

832
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,506
- Enough!
- Yeah, enough!

833
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,582
You know, they shot Old Yeller
at the end, you twits.

834
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,201
Oh. Spoiler alert!

835
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:24,509
Soon, we'll be overrun by every banner
tower, skywriter and air freighter

836
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:27,271
who thinks they can be one of us.

837
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,903
That farm boy forgot who he is
and where he came from.

838
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,229
He's not about to stop me
from making history.

839
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,344
<i>Dusty, Dusty,
where did you learn to race?</i>

840
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,467
<i>From my coach, Skipper.</i>

841
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,820
<i>He's the reason I'm even here.
He's an amazing instructor.</i>

842
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,947
<i>And a great friend.</i>

843
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,104
<i>He flew dozens of missions
all around the world.</i>

844
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:49,264
<i>And I'm sure, if he could,
he'd be with us right now.</i>

845
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,070
Whoa, your engine sounds kind of rough.

846
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,666
Must be a mag misfire.

847
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:02,066
It's probably not a good night
for flying anyway.

848
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:08,469
- Okay. Come back soon.
- Hey, you got anything new?

849
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,941
I'm glad you asked.

850
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,866
I'm now selling these one-of-a-kind
Dusty commemorative mugs.

851
00:44:15,394 --> 00:44:17,394
- Wow.
- Wow.

852
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,820
<i>This is Dusty Crophopper calling...</i>

853
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,147
- I'll be back in 10.
- Dusty, eighth place!

854
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,949
Way to go, Dustmeister!

855
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,990
- Hey! You finally removed your M5000.
- His what?

856
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,381
His Micro-Air-5000-D-L
Aerial Applicator.

857
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,110
Use your words.

858
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,625
His sprayer.

859
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,544
Right! Sprayer.

860
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,190
Dusty, you got a big leg tomorrow.

861
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,183
- Yeah.
<i>- How you feeling?</i>

862
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,581
<i>I can't believe it.
The mighty Himalayas.</i>

863
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,708
<i>Dusty, that vertical wind shear</i>

864
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,306
is going to be wicked
over those mountains.

865
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,303
Well, the good thing
about being that high up,

866
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,109
you see, there's not a lot of oxygen.

867
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,029
So, if you crash, no explosion.

868
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,301
Great, Chug.

869
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,144
<i>Of course,
you could die of hypothermia</i>

870
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,870
<i>or an avalanche could get you.</i>

871
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,869
<i>Then, of course, there's
pneumonia, or even frostbite.</i>

872
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,425
Chug, Chug, I got it.

873
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,662
Skip, what if a guy wanted to fly

874
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,420
through the mountains
instead of over them?

875
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:05,384
<i>Bad idea. The Wrenches
flew through terrain like that</i>

876
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,668
in the Assault of Kunming.
And Dottie is right.

877
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,741
<i>Wind coming over the peaks
can stir up rotors</i>

878
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,060
<i>that'll drag you right down.</i>

879
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,587
<i>If you ask me, it's time to lug-nut up.</i>

880
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,789
<i>You can fly a whole lot higher
than you think.</i>

881
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,988
- Roger that.
- Hola, <i>corazon</i>.

882
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,824
- Are you tired?
- What?

883
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:24,871
Because you have been flying
through my mind, nonstop.

884
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:30,431
And why would I be tired flying
through such a teeny, tiny space?

885
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,346
You can only pretend for so long.

886
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:38,062
Hey, El Chu, what's the problem?

887
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:42,428
I am Icarus and she is the sun.

888
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,583
I fly too close and I melt.

889
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,185
Maybe you're trying too hard.

890
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:51,265
Look, all you got to do is go over,
open your mouth and say...

891
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,706
Hello.

892
00:45:58,314 --> 00:46:00,214
Wow.

893
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,101
El Chupacabra!

894
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,626
I think someone is calling me.
I have to go.

895
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,031
I wanted to compliment you
on your success, Dusty.

896
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,229
You're doing very well
for your first race.

897
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,901
That means a lot, coming from you.

898
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,305
I mean, come on,

899
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:18,669
you were named most aerodynamic
racer by Air Sports Illustrated.

900
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:22,108
And let me just say,
you are so aerodynamic.

901
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,784
Dusty.

902
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,829
What's with
all the tractors around here?

903
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,300
They're sacred.

904
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,384
Many believe that
we will be recycled as tractors.

905
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,789
Well, I believe in recycling.

906
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,822
Have you ever been to the Taj Mahal?

907
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,983
No. No, I haven't.

908
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,824
Come on. Let's go.

909
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,264
It must be nice to be back home.

910
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:01,981
Well, it's complicated.
I have a billion fans.

911
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,069
And they're all expecting me to win.

912
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,387
Maybe this time, you will.

913
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,541
Wow.

914
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,902
This place is amazing.

915
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,391
It really is.

916
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:40,465
And tomorrow, you'll fly over
the magnificent Himalayas.

917
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:43,266
Those little hills?
Yeah, well... No big deal.

918
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,482
You like to fly low, don't you?

919
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:48,066
Oh, that? That's strategic.

920
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:50,462
Air density and combustion.

921
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:54,426
You know, you could follow
the Iron Compass, instead.

922
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,430
- Iron Compass?
- Yeah, rail road tracks.

923
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,749
Through a valley in the mountains,
so you can still fly low.

924
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,390
Really?

925
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,150
Thanks, Ishani.

926
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,745
Anytime.

927
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:12,062
<i>Every racer's nightmare
is scaling the Himalayas.</i>

928
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,303
<i>It's a short leg ahead,
but extremely treacherous.</i>

929
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,461
No.

930
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,543
Hello?

931
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,631
Is this where I'm supposed to be?

932
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:09,784
That is one of life's great questions.

933
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,224
I'm dead!

934
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,546
Mr. Crophopper.

935
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,503
Welcome to Nepal.

936
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,226
I don't understand.
Have the others left already?

937
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:22,542
Actually, no one else is here yet.

938
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:25,021
You're in first place.

939
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,267
Really?

940
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,509
He flew through a what?

941
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,781
- A tunnel?
- That is crazy!

942
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,546
<i>Si</i>, crazy like a Firefox.

943
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,303
Dusty, how does it feel
to be in first place?

944
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,541
It feels great.

945
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,749
But more than anything,
I'm just happy I fit through that tunnel.

946
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:45,011
Guys, I gotta tell you,
if you're ever in a tight squeeze just...

947
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,745
Excuse me, guys.

948
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,463
Crazy day today, huh?

949
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:59,065
Yeah, a very exciting win for you today.

950
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,390
Quite a risk you took.

951
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:04,504
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, your propeller, is it new?

952
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,742
Oh, I suppose it is.

953
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,670
Sky Slycer Mark Five, right?

954
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,744
Aren't those made exclusively
for Ripslinger's race team?

955
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,631
- Are they?
- Yeah. Yeah, they are.

956
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,305
Dusty...

957
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,120
- You set me up.
- Look, I didn't ever want to hurt you.

958
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,184
- Why?
- It's complicated, okay?

959
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,830
You could have gotten me
killed out there today.

960
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:26,426
I really thought that
you'd just turn around.

961
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,702
Well, you were wrong.

962
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,544
And I was wrong about you.

963
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,765
Hey, Rip. Thanks for first place.

964
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,781
<i>Flying low and quick,</i>

965
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:42,864
<i>Dusty Crophopper is managing
to hold on to the top spot.</i>

966
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,343
<i>But current reigning champ, Ripslinger,
is just seconds behind him.</i>

967
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,304
<i>This surprise battle for first place</i>

968
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:50,462
has made Dusty Crophopper
the one to watch.

969
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:54,188
<i>He's become a working-class hero
around the globe.</i>

970
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:13,665
I told you he could do it.

971
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,470
That's it.

972
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,542
That was my skyPad, man.

973
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,262
A new one is coming out in two weeks.

974
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:32,383
<i>You're really showing them
big-time racers a thing or two, huh?</i>

975
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,350
Yeah. We head out across
the Pacific tomorrow, Skip.

976
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,149
You were stationed there
for a while, right?

977
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,302
- Yeah.
- Got any advice?

978
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:42,384
Back in '41,
during the Battle over Wake Island

979
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,866
<i>the Wrenches ran into
serious monsoons</i>

980
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,984
<i>with embedded CBs that could
tear your wings right off.</i>

981
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,506
<i>Be careful. And one more thing...</i>

982
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,145
I'm proud of you, Dusty.

983
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,427
Thanks, wingman.

984
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,850
<i>Hey, Dusty,</i>

985
00:52:57,876 --> 00:52:59,476
we have a surprise for you.

986
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,985
You gotta let me tell him.

987
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,426
Go ahead, Chug.

988
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:06,344
I know it. It's...
<i>It's on the tip of my tongue.</i>

989
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:07,541
I'll remember.

990
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,190
We're going...

991
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,184
<i>We're going...</i>

992
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,183
- <i>to...</i>
- To...

993
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,747
- Mexico.
- Mexico! That's it!

994
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,631
- We're going <i>to meet you in Mexico.</i>
- Really?

995
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,743
Yep. Tickets are on Sparky and me.

996
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:27,110
We sold 326 Dusty bobbleheads,
143 antenna balls,

997
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,103
203 spinner mugs...

998
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:34,266
And 1,000 whistles.
Go, Team <i>Dusterino! Yeah!</i>

999
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,190
You sure you're up for it, Skipper?

1000
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,861
You bet.
Somebody else is doing the flying.

1001
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,301
That's great news, guys.
I'll see you in Mexico.

1002
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,329
<i>- Yeah.
- I'll bring the salsa!</i>

1003
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,062
Hey, El Chu, where's the fire?

1004
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,183
It is in my soul.

1005
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:54,469
Tonight, I shall win the heart

1006
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,703
of Miss Rochelle.

1007
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,104
No, no, no. A thousand no's.

1008
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,628
Dusty, what are you doing?

1009
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,787
Low and slow.

1010
00:54:51,212 --> 00:54:53,612
Oohh.

1011
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,670
What does that mean?

1012
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:12,224
No idea, but French-Canadian
is the language of love in Quebec.

1013
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:13,586
So, it's got to be good.

1014
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,350
I'm in your debt, <i>compadre</i>.

1015
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,470
If ever you need me, I shall be there.

1016
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:21,743
<i>Compadre.</i> I like <i>that.</i>

1017
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:23,991
You are looking live

1018
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:26,791
at Pudong Shanghai
International Airport...

1019
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:31,704
Yep. First place.
Not too bad for a farm boy.

1020
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,381
Oh, yeah?

1021
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:36,303
Well, first place is for losers.

1022
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,189
Can it, moron!

1023
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:42,703
Now, listen up.
It's time to make yourselves useful.

1024
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:46,420
What happened to you?

1025
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:49,550
That song. It flipped a switch.

1026
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,829
My little monster. Come here.

1027
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,266
Please! No!

1028
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,906
She is like a jaguar now.

1029
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:00,425
My little <i>burrito</i>.

1030
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:01,746
Be gentle with me!

1031
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,029
<i>Start your engines.</i>

1032
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,387
<i>This is our sixth and longest leg.</i>

1033
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:15,191
<i>These racers will need to
follow their GPS antennas</i>

1034
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:19,350
<i>because there's a big ocean
between here and Mexico.</i>

1035
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,226
My antenna!

1036
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:38,342
Oh, no! No! No!

1037
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,104
What am I going to do?

1038
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:47,301
<i>Last known coordinates,
26 degrees, 31 minutes.</i>

1039
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,791
<i>Hawaii, are you there?</i>

1040
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:52,906
Do you read? I am low on fuel.

1041
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,431
Oh, no!

1042
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,227
Oh, boy.

1043
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:04,747
Unknown rider, unknown rider.
You have entered restricted airspace.

1044
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,660
Why haven't you responded
to radio contact?

1045
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,191
<i>Somebody cut off my antenna.</i>

1046
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:10,786
- Identify yourself.
<i>- I'm Dusty Crophopper.</i>

1047
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:11,581
Roger that.

1048
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,765
Bogey has been identified
as Crophopper Seven.

1049
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,908
I'm running on vapors. I need to land.

1050
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,949
What are you doing out here
with an empty tank?

1051
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,750
I thought I'd refuel in Hawaii, but...

1052
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,471
Hawaii is 375 miles southwest of here.

1053
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,541
- What?
- Listen, Crophopper.

1054
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:24,991
You better follow us to the boat.

1055
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,466
No bingo fields around here.

1056
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,981
- "Bingo fields"?
- Places to land.

1057
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:32,064
- The boat?
- The USS Dwight D. Flysenhower.

1058
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,781
<i>Bravo, checking in as frag plus one.
Check.</i>

1059
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:37,385
<i>- Two.
- Go ahead, Bravo.</i>

1060
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,304
<i>Bogey is civilian.
Needs emergency fuel.</i>

1061
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,428
- Copy that.
- For flying out loud!

1062
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:44,185
That's all I need,
a civilian exploding on my deck.

1063
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:45,910
We could rig the barricade, sir.

1064
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,306
All engines, ahead flank.

1065
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:50,509
Aye, Captain. All engines ahead flank.

1066
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:52,663
<i>- Rig the barricade.</i>
- Copy that.

1067
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:55,266
Rig the barricade!
Chop-chop. Hubba-hubba.

1068
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:57,070
Let's line you up for the barricade.

1069
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:00,064
All you got to do is
throttle on back and call the ball

1070
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:01,504
and hopefully end up in the spaghetti.

1071
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,540
What?
<i>Wait, no, wait! Wait a second!</i>

1072
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,942
Guys, I'm not sure I can do this.

1073
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,465
I don't see how you have a choice.

1074
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,946
Okay. But that runway is moving.

1075
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:10,261
We'll set you up on the glide path.

1076
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:11,705
Runways are not supposed to move.

1077
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,629
Okay. I'm okay. I'm going to be fine.

1078
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,145
- Take it easy.
- Moving runway, moving runway.

1079
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:17,221
- There it is. Here we go.
- Throttle on back.

1080
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,561
Maybe if I just came around again.

1081
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,489
- Level your wings.
- Easy with it.

1082
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,230
Cut, cut, cut!

1083
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:25,551
Stop!

1084
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:38,264
We've got you, Crophopper.

1085
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:42,300
Come on, let's get you fixed up,
refueled and back in the race.

1086
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,671
You are way behind.

1087
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:45,589
Thanks, guys.
You saved my tail out there.

1088
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:47,464
- Victory.
- Victory.

1089
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,111
Hey, what is that?

1090
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,746
That's the Jolly Wrenches
Wall of Fame.

1091
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:54,271
Every flyer, every mission.

1092
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:57,421
Skipper... Skipper... Skipper...

1093
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,791
There he is.

1094
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:04,747
Wait. I don't understand.
Why is there only one mission?

1095
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:07,990
Chug, what's all that?

1096
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:10,870
Well, I've never been out of the country.
You know, I brought the Commodium.

1097
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,947
Whatever you do, don't drink the petrol.

1098
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,711
We're only going for two days.

1099
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,384
Got to be prepared, right?

1100
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,508
Got beachwear,
dinner wear, underwear...

1101
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,822
<i>Skipper? Come in, Skipper.</i>

1102
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:23,506
Dusty! We're heading off
to Mexico right now.

1103
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,906
Glad you got there safe.

1104
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,711
<i>Weather report says a major storm
is brewing out there.</i>

1105
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:30,670
I'm not in Mexico.
I'm with the Jolly Wrenches.

1106
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:33,068
You're on the Flysenhower?

1107
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:36,861
<i>Hey, I saw the Wall of Fame.
They only list one mission for you.</i>

1108
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:39,202
Dusty, if you're not past
that storm yet,

1109
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,449
- you need...
- <i>That can't be right.</i>

1110
01:00:40,474 --> 01:00:42,865
- It must be a mistake.
<i>- Look, you have to get out of there.</i>

1111
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:44,624
<i>You're going to have to fly high.</i>

1112
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:46,941
- Is it true?
<i>- Listen to me, get above the storm!</i>

1113
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,148
- Skipper, is it true?
<i>- It's true!</i>

1114
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,702
It's true.

1115
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:57,261
I only flew one mission.

1116
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:00,228
But all those stories?

1117
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,428
Crophopper,
we got weather moving in fast.

1118
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:04,340
You've got to take off
before it's too late.

1119
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,501
I just need a second here.

1120
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:06,741
That's a negative, son.

1121
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:08,629
You don't go now, you don't go at all.

1122
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:12,228
<i>Be advised, the JTWC has issued
a tropical cyclone formation alert</i>

1123
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,904
<i>for the northeast Pacific ocean.</i>

1124
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,551
<i>Area of convection is located

01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:23,620
Report to catapult two.

1128
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,783
The cat will take you from
zero to 160 knots in two seconds.

1129
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:28,021
Two seconds?

1130
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:29,864
We're going to check your weight
and set the steam pressure.

1131
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:32,068
Remember, climb straight ahead
once you get airborne.

1132
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,581
- Climb straight ahead.
- Get above the storm.

1133
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:39,786
Okay, engine full throttle.
Nod to the shooter when you're set.

1134
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,190
Go win it for the Wrenches, Dusty.

1135
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:44,388
<i>Volo Pro Veritas</i>!

1136
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:48,382
Head Wind's good. Pressure's good.

1137
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:51,106
Go on cat two.

1138
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,870
Senor Ripslinger, any comment

1139
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,941
on the disappearance
of Dusty Crophopper?

1140
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:07,667
Dusty was a nice guy
who flew the challenge

1141
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,142
and pierced the clouds of mediocrity.

1142
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:13,668
We're all going to miss him. Excuse me.

1143
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:16,261
Let's just hope he makes
a better boat than a plane.

1144
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:17,751
That's a good one, boss.

1145
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:20,627
Oh yeah, that was pretty good.

1146
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:27,348
Senor Dusty
has ten times the engine you do.

1147
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,104
And 10 times the integrity.

1148
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:31,786
Said the plane with
the shiny new propeller.

1149
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:34,904
How much integrity did
that one cost you, sweetheart?

1150
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:37,901
Too much.

1151
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:40,904
You used to be a great champion.

1152
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:43,347
How the mighty have fallen.

1153
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:50,351
You are not even worthy
of a cape swish.

1154
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:53,544
Really?

1155
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,944
<i>How can it be only one mission?</i>

1156
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:58,181
<i>The Battle of Airway.</i>

1157
01:02:58,260 --> 01:02:59,944
<i>The raid in Tujunga Harbor.
The Aleutians.</i>

1158
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:02,984
<i>The Battle of Wake Island.
The Assault on Kunming.</i>

1159
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:05,909
I got to get above the storm!

1160
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:26,186
Mayday! Mayday! I am going down!

1161
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:29,031
18 degrees north, six minutes, 119...

1162
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:46,830
Help!

1163
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,220
- Dusty!
<i>- Me Amigo!</i>

1164
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:17,870
Quick, to the hangar.

1165
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:23,350
Broken wing ribs,
twisted gear, bent prop,

1166
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:28,350
and your main spar is cracked bad.

1167
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:33,183
It's over.

1168
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:36,222
One mission?

1169
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:39,161
So much for <i>Volo Pro Veritas</i>.

1170
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:45,543
Can we get a minute alone, please?

1171
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,867
You, too, Sparky.

1172
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:05,583
My first patrol as a Jolly Wrench
was at Glendal Canal.

1173
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:09,188
My squadron was all rookies.
All razor sharp.

1174
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:10,827
<i>I should know.</i>

1175
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,466
<i>I trained every single one of them.</i>

1176
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:17,181
<i>It was supposed to be a routine patrol.
A milk run.</i>

1177
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:20,469
Look, Skipper, enemy ship
two o'clock low, two miles.

1178
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:23,430
- Easy pickings. What do you say?
- Negative, Jigsaw Two.

1179
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,583
Our orders are to recon
and report back.

1180
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:28,748
Come on, Skip, it will be a turkey shoot.

1181
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:30,988
- Let's do it, Skipper.
- Yeah, come on!

1182
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:33,622
All right. Let's go in for a closer look.

1183
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:35,623
But keep your distance.

1184
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:42,668
Holy Cow! It's the whole enemy fleet!

1185
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,385
<i>It was too late to pull up.</i>

1186
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:48,383
Get out of there, Lucas!

1187
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:24,981
<i>My whole squadron.</i>

1188
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:28,741
Under my command.

1189
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:36,031
After that, I just couldn't
bring myself to fly again.

1190
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:39,942
Let me ask you something, Dusty.

1191
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:43,502
If you knew the truth about my past,

1192
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:46,590
would you have asked me to train you?

1193
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:51,904
No.

1194
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:01,062
I'm sorry, Dusty.

1195
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:18,865
Dusty?

1196
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:21,983
Can you believe it?

1197
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:25,064
He hasn't been straight with me
this whole time.

1198
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:27,382
At least you were honest.

1199
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:29,747
You said I wasn't built for this.

1200
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,825
I guess I should have listened to you.

1201
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:36,701
Dusty, if you had listened to me
I would never ever forgive myself.

1202
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:41,066
Look, the Skipper may have
been wrong for what he did,

1203
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,263
but he was right about you.

1204
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:47,543
You're not a crop duster. You're a racer.

1205
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:48,986
And now...

1206
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:52,110
the whole world knows it.

1207
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:04,108
Thanks, Dottie.

1208
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:06,468
That means a lot.

1209
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:11,428
I've gone as far as I can go.
I'm busted up, look at me.

1210
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:14,227
Yes, look at you.

1211
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:24,391
Dusty, I cannot bear the thought
of competing without you.

1212
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:28,181
Hey, that's the wing
of a T-33 Shooting Star.

1213
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:31,264
When the great Mexican Air Force
needed help,

1214
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:35,829
American T-33s came.
They did not ask questions.

1215
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:38,904
They did not hesitate. They were there.

1216
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:42,348
Because that is what <i>compadres</i> do.

1217
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:43,726
And what's that?

1218
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:45,390
That is my lunch. Don't touch.

1219
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:48,271
But the wings are yours.

1220
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,383
El Chu, I really appreciate...

1221
01:08:50,384 --> 01:08:51,794
<i>Silencio.</i>

1222
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:55,791
After all, you helped me
with my pursuits of the heart.

1223
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:57,590
Now we are here to help you.

1224
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:01,181
- We?
- <i>Oui</i>.

1225
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:06,351
Good luck tomorrow, Dusty.
I am so proud to compete with you.

1226
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:10,550
You're a good egg, Dusty.
Look, here's a sat-nav device.

1227
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:11,986
Just in case...

1228
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:15,547
In case you ever find yourself
lost, you know, without a...

1229
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,750
Without a friend to help you through it.

1230
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:20,466
Thank you, Bulldog.

1231
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:23,430
Here's a flow control valve for you.

1232
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:27,551
How about a starter generator?

1233
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:30,186
It is honor to fly beside you.

1234
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,540
Thanks, everyone. Really.

1235
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:34,788
This is fantastic.

1236
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:36,180
Looks like all you need now is a...

1237
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,705
A new propeller?

1238
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:40,591
How about a Sky Slycer Mark Five?

1239
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:46,102
Wait, that's your propeller.
You could still win the race.

1240
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:49,748
I intend to, but with my old propeller.

1241
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:52,949
This one didn't really suit me.

1242
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:56,622
But I think you
will have a lot better luck with it.

1243
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:59,030
Thanks, Ishani.

1244
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:01,509
Dottie, can you fix me?

1245
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:05,380
Does a PT6A
have a multi-stage compressor?

1246
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:10,029
Yes! Yes it does.

1247
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:12,666
All right, you guys,
let's get him ready to race.

1248
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:25,020
<i>This one's...</i>

1249
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:29,341
What?

1250
01:10:29,666 --> 01:10:31,266
Hmm.

1251
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:39,662
<i>We are live from Mexico.
And here they come.</i>

1252
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:43,024
This is it, race fans.
The final leg back to New York.

1253
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:47,301
Whoa, dude!

1254
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,902
- We'll see you in New York.
- Thanks, guys.

1255
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:00,425
It's dustin' time!

1256
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:01,951
Dusty <i>la vista,</i> baby!

1257
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,751
You have to hand it to him.
He never gives up.

1258
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:06,789
Come on, Chug, we have a jet to catch.

1259
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:09,944
New York City.
Finish line, here we come!

1260
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,262
Hey. So are you ready to go, Skip?

1261
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:16,830
Probably best if I don't.

1262
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:17,901
What...

1263
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:20,543
Okay.

1264
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:22,622
Are you sure?

1265
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,304
Yeah.

1266
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:34,109
- Dusty.
- He's back.

1267
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:39,307
- You got to be kidding me.
- Whoa.

1268
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,709
- Who's that guy?
- It's the crop duster.

1269
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:44,066
- Another one?
- It's the same one, Knucklehead.

1270
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:45,346
Move aside, idiots.

1271
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:51,949
Bolting on a few new parts
doesn't change who you are.

1272
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,926
I can still smell the farm on you.

1273
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:00,190
You know what? I finally get it.

1274
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:04,711
You're afraid of
getting beat by a crop duster.

1275
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:09,350
Well, check six, because I'm coming.

1276
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:12,031
And what are you punks looking at?

1277
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:13,670
- Nothing. Nothing.
- Sorry.

1278
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:19,990
We are going to end this,
once and for all.

1279
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:22,308
- Yeah, man.
- This is going to be fun.

1280
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:30,264
<i>This one's all about speed
and the willingness to give it all.</i>

1281
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:35,420
<i>First to cut the ribbon in New York
takes home that trophy and the glory.</i>

1282
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:40,326
<i>And we're off
as the first flyers take to the air.</i>

1283
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,387
I will wait for you
at the finish line, hermosa.

1284
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:47,111
No, no, no. I will be waiting for you.

1285
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,747
<i>The rest of the field
is now off and running.</i>

1286
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:05,221
<i>And though Crophopper did not
complete the previous leg,</i>

1287
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:08,589
<i>race officials ruled his radio
had been tampered with.</i>

1288
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:09,980
<i>So he'll be allowed to compete.</i>

1289
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:12,781
<i>But with a severe time penalty.</i>

1290
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:32,426
<i>I've never seen someone come
back from this far behind.</i>

1291
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:35,060
<i>It's going to take both
horsepower and willpower</i>

1292
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:36,380
<i>to even have a chance.</i>

1293
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:53,262
Good show, Dusty.

1294
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:16,622
- Ehm... Boss?
- What?

1295
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:18,141
He's here.

1296
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:22,183
Okay, we're out of camera range.

1297
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:24,109
You know what to do.

1298
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:35,947
- Hey, farmer.
- Time to plow the fields.

1299
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:39,026
Looks like you've run out of airspace,
Crophopper.

1300
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,227
Hey!

1301
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:47,421
- Skipper?
- Dusty, pull up!

1302
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,468
Skipper? You're flying!

1303
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,721
<i>Oh, you noticed.</i>

1304
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:56,942
<i>Listen, I got Rip.
You take care of the other two.</i>

1305
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:58,021
Got it.

1306
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:09,541
<i>They're on your six, kid.
You gotta lose them.</i>

1307
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:10,986
I'm trying.

1308
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:14,970
Skip, I can't shake 'em.

1309
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:17,222
Pull hard right.
I'll break left and take out Rip.

1310
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:19,627
- Use the rocks.
- Roger that!

1311
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:27,052
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1312
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:28,386
Yeah!

1313
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:30,867
Oh, that's going to leave a mark.

1314
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:41,345
What?

1315
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,751
Say hello to the Warsaw Windmill.

1316
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:47,107
- You're crazy!
- That's right.

1317
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:51,067
- Dusty! Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

1318
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:53,103
That was pretty good for a crop duster.

1319
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:56,868
And not bad for
an old-timer who doesn't fly.

1320
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:01,742
Oh yeah? Well, I may be old,
but at least I ain't afraid of heights.

1321
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:03,140
Okay.

1322
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:06,821
No!

1323
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:10,550
That's why they call them Sky Slycers!

1324
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:17,149
Oh, no. Skipper, are you okay?

1325
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:18,944
Are you kiddin'? I'm great.

1326
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:22,263
- But what about your tail?
- I'll live. Go get 'em!

1327
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:23,830
Go!

1328
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:31,310
<i>We're closing in
on the final stretch, folks.</i>

1329
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:32,861
<i>That's right, Colin.</i>

1330
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:34,900
<i>And ever since they emerged
from Deadstick Desert,</i>

1331
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:38,582
<i>Ripslinger has maintained a lead.</i>

1332
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:44,631
Any sign of them?

1333
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:46,301
Nothing yet.

1334
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:03,301
- What?
- Hi.

1335
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,785
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

1336
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:15,205
Not now! Not now!

1337
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,870
Come on, come on, come on.

1338
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:18,550
No!

1339
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:25,300
<i>Tailwinds like
nothing you've ever flown.</i>

1340
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:27,830
Roger that, Skip.

1341
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:38,306
Don't look down. Don't look down.
Don't look down. Don't look down.

1342
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:02,670
Oh yeah!

1343
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:27,383
Okay, time to eat my dust.

1344
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:32,500
With another win for Ripslinger
seeming inevitable...

1345
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:34,180
Wait a second, it's Dusty Crophopper!

1346
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:35,910
- Yes!
- Go!

1347
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:40,583
<i>And here they come, down the stretch.</i>

1348
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:43,149
<i>It's going to be close,
it's anyone's race.</i>

1349
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:45,707
All right, get my good side, fellas.

1350
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,067
What?

1351
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:59,109
Yes!

1352
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,422
<i>He's done it! He's done it.</i>

1353
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:04,589
Crophopper!

1354
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:06,020
No!

1355
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:07,301
What?

1356
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:10,483
<i>From last to first.</i>

1357
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:12,510
<i>From obscurity to immortality,</i>

1358
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:15,066
<i>the racing world
will never forget this day.</i>

1359
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:16,983
<i>For the first time, a crop duster</i>

1360
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:19,108
<i>has won the
Wings Around the Globe Rally!</i>

1361
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:20,950
Yes, Dusty!

1362
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:26,901
<i>Magnifique</i>, Dusty!

1363
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:29,461
You really kicked his bottom, lad!

1364
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,627
All right. Yeah!
Now that's how to pass!

1365
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:34,861
You did it!

1366
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,749
I couldn't have done it
without you, Dottie.

1367
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,102
Yeah, I know.

1368
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:42,782
Hey, buddy, great tip about Ripslinger
leaning to the cameras. Thanks, Chug.

1369
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:44,709
Hey, anything for my pal.

1370
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:49,303
Well done, Dusty.
The world has a new champion.

1371
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:50,950
And so do I.

1372
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:53,871
Thanks, Ishani. For everything.

1373
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:55,910
<i>- Herr</i> Dusty!
- Franz?

1374
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:57,220
- Hoorah!
- What are you doing here?

1375
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:01,146
We came to watch you win the race.
You are an inspiration to all of us.

1376
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:02,987
- "All Of us"?
- Yeah.

1377
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:07,267
All of us who want to do more
than just what we were built for.

1378
01:20:09,494 --> 01:20:10,794
Whoa!

1379
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:13,187
Thanks, guys!

1380
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:16,788
Ripstinker. Yeah, that's your name.
That's some supersonic sewer sauce.

1381
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,140
Man, I thought
Vita-stink-a-bunch was bad.

1382
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:20,909
That's got nothing on you.

1383
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:23,786
You're just nasty. Nastilicious.

1384
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:25,664
You need to go home and wash up.

1385
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:27,231
Twice.

1386
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,668
Who's that guy?

1387
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:01,986
Thanks, Skip.

1388
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:03,261
Don't thank me.

1389
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:08,384
I learned a lot more from you
than you ever learned from me.

1390
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:41,345
Attention on deck. Victory!

1391
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:42,586
Victory!

1392
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,221
It's an honor to be here.

1393
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,341
Hook 'em up.

1394
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:02,270
- You ready, wingman?
- Roger that.

1395
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:05,466
An honorary Jolly Wrench.
How's that feel, Dusty?

1396
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:06,621
It feels great!

1397
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:09,300
Back in the saddle again, eh, Skipper?

1398
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:12,225
Well, they didn't have these fancy toys
the last time I did this.

1399
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,540
Nothing to it.

1400
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:16,100
They hook you up,
you nod to the shooter over there,

1401
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:17,347
and hang on!

1402
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:25,124
Yeah!

1403
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:39,948
- Last one back to Propwash buys!
- You're on!
