1
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,669
Aspen Prison shuttle docked.

2
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:54,590
Parolees prepare to disembark.

3
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,600
Ferguson, Herman.

4
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,607
Six months sentence,
Aspen Prison served.

5
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,900
Welcome back, citizen.

6
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,943
Your living assignment is...

7
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,987
"Y" -Block, Heavenly Haven.

8
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,990
Red quad. Move on. Come on.

9
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,478
Welcome home.

10
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,672
That's it!

11
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,091
- I think that's Heavenly Haven.
- In your dreams, buddy.

12
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,801
Yeah, Heavenly...

13
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,638
Starting descent to Sector 12,

14
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,889
Yellow District.

15
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,850
Nine-hundred feet.

16
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,643
Seven-hundred feet.

17
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,396
Four-hundred feet.

18
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:18,025
Take caution in this sector.
There is a citizen riot in progress.

19
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,068
Have a nice day.

20
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,894
It's better than prison.

21
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,813
Jesus Christ!

22
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:01,443
Eat recycled food
for a happier, healthier life.

23
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,404
Be kind and peaceful to each other.

24
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,782
Eat recycled food.

25
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,450
Recycled food.

26
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,453
It's good for the environment
and okay for you.

27
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,003
Hey, look what I got!

28
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,881
Little cupcake.

29
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,258
What have we got here?

30
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,387
Are you a Judge spy, little man?

31
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:32,474
Me, a spy?
This guy is funny.

32
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,893
No, no, no. I live here.

33
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:39,648
I mean, I'm gonna live here, if I live.
Maybe I should go to a hotel?

34
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,651
No way, man!
Don't you hear 'em out there?

35
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,820
It's block war, man!

36
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,077
- Block war.
- Yeah.

37
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,106
Just like an Academy simulation
right down to the cross fire.

38
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,067
- I'll lead off. You follow.
- This is no sim, rookie!

39
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,528
We'll stand down and wait for backup.

40
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,199
Hershey and Brisco in position
outside Heavenly Haven!

41
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,286
We're under fire from the upper floors.
Request backup.

42
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,372
Cell "B" in Heavenly Haven,
on the corner of Abbott and Costello.

43
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,957
Request backup.

44
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,413
Holy crud!

45
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,248
He's a sitting duck out there.

46
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,958
He knows what he's doing.

47
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,673
I am the Law!

48
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,095
Drop your weapons!

49
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:39,726
These blocks are under arrest!

50
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:45,315
This is your final warning!

51
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,025
That's Judge Dredd, man!

52
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,277
Hey! You wanna be afraid
of somebody?

53
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,570
Be afraid of me!

54
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,948
I got it!

55
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,408
Why don't I run down there
and surrender?

56
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,910
Sort of throw 'em off guard!

57
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,579
Bad idea.

58
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,958
Hey, Dredd! Come and get us!

59
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,714
I knew they'd do that.

60
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,216
Judge Dredd, take cover!

61
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:16,638
They're firing.20 millimeter caseless
flechette rounds at 300 meters.

62
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:20,433
The effective lethal range
is 200 meters.

63
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,227
You're safe.

64
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,063
What are you doing down there,
Judge Hershey?

65
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,108
Waiting for backup.

66
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,779
It's here.

67
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,949
Let's move it out.
Keep it simple. Single file.

68
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,828
Standard relay. I'm point. You're last.

69
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,791
- Grenade.
- Grenade.

70
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,464
- Nice shot, sir!
- You two meet me on the 40th.

71
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,800
Hey, you need to get some more ammo!

72
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:58,638
Be kind and peaceful to each other.
Eat recycled food.

73
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,099
Hey, you guys with us?

74
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,059
Yeah! All right!

75
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,270
Let's rock 'n' roll!

76
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,489
Dredd!

77
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,164
This room has been pacified.

78
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,707
Next one's mine!

79
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,959
No! Rookie, hold on!

80
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,753
This room is under arrest!

81
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,464
No!

82
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,633
Die, Judges! Die!

83
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,845
You're under arrest.

84
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,057
Throw down your weapons,
and prepare to be judged!

85
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,559
Judge this, Lawgiver man!

86
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,187
- No, don't! They're booby-trapped.
- Intruder.

87
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,775
Holy drok!

88
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,903
Full auto. Rapid-fire.

89
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,905
Rapid-fire.

90
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:06,039
- Armor piercing.
- Armor piercing.

91
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,250
Drop dead, Dredd!

92
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:14,673
- Double whammy.
- Double whammy.

93
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,431
Mega City municipal code 213,

94
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,518
willful destruction of property.
That's two years.

95
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,813
Code 310, illegal possession
of assault weapons, five years.

96
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:33,942
Code 457, resisting arrest, 20 years!

97
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,071
Thank you, Hershey.

98
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,410
And code 3613,

99
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:47,789
the first degree murder
of a Street Judge.

100
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,583
Let me guess. Life.

101
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,714
Death.

102
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,636
Court's adjourned.

103
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,390
Violence struck again in
Mega City tonight, taking a deadly toll.

104
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:09,519
Fifty-three hospitalized,
five of them children. Nineteen dead.

105
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,813
You got him?

106
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:15,024
Bring him up. Okay. Now, just turn...
The other way. You got him?

107
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,318
Damn it!

108
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,488
I was supposed to be
watching out for him.

109
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,658
Don't blame yourself, Hershey.
He made the mistake, not you.

110
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,830
Wouldn't it feel good to have
an emotion once in a while, huh?

111
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,165
Emotions.

112
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,168
There ought to be a law against them.

113
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,838
- Eat recycled food.
- Halt!

114
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:40,008
It's good for the environment,
and okay for you.

115
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,428
Please make your selection.
Insert your credit in the slot.

116
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:47,015
- You have five seconds to surrender!
- Dredd, it's just a servo-droid.

117
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,641
- The servo-droid is your friend.
- Five.

118
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,143
- Please let your friend go by.
- Four.

119
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,897
- Three. Two.
- You are in the way of the servo-droid.

120
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:57,525
- One!
- Boy, am I glad to see you!

121
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,779
Mega City code 7592,

122
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,531
willful sabotage of a public droid.
That's six months, citizen.

123
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,201
Let's see your Unicard.

124
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:10,038
Come on, give me a break,
Judge Dredd. Dredd?

125
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,583
- God!
- Ferguson, Herman. Hacker.

126
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:17,170
Illegal tampering with city droids,
computers, cash machines, taxi robots.

127
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,173
And you haven't even
been out ofjail for 24 hours.

128
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,633
He's habitual, Hershey.
Automatic five-year sentence.

129
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,052
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty?

130
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,221
I knew you'd say that.

131
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:30,225
Five years? No! No! I had no choice.

132
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,769
- They were killing each other.
- You could've gone out the window.

133
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,813
Forty floors? It would've been suicide.

134
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,232
Maybe, but it's legal.

135
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,775
Judges?

136
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,943
- Yes, sir?
- What?

137
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,737
Five years. Aspen Penitentiary.
Case closed. Take him away.

138
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:47,450
Don't close the case.
You're misjudging me! Open the case!

139
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,953
You're not going to be able
to sleep tonight.

140
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,996
He might've been telling
the truth, you know.

141
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,415
Haven't you ever heard
of extenuating circumstances?

142
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,210
I've heard it all, Hershey.

143
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,588
I knew you'd say that.

144
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:10,265
My fellow Judges,
have we forgotten the lessons of history?

145
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,601
However quickly these
block wars can be contained,

146
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,646
it's clear that
they're becoming an epidemic,

147
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,817
an epidemic that should
be dealt with immediately.

148
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,487
The only solution
is a tougher criminal code.

149
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,448
Our situation gets worse every day.

150
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,285
Seventy-three citizen riots
in 16 different sectors

151
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,786
in the last two months alone.

152
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,832
Violent crime is rising
at 15% every quarter.

153
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,126
If we don't increase our resources,

154
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,879
they will be inadequate
in less than three years.

155
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,548
Three years?
Our resources are inadequate now!

156
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,633
My fellow Council members,

157
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,012
as a city we continue to grow,

158
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,306
and growth is painful.

159
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:57,312
Sixty-five million people living in
an area designed for no more than 20!

160
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:02,275
It's not enough that they rely on us
for food, clothes, water, clean air...

161
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,820
Chief Justice, the city is in chaos!

162
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,990
For social order, we need tighter reins.

163
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,451
Incarceration hasn't worked
as a deterrent.

164
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:15,705
I say we expand execution
to include lesser crimes!

165
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,542
My fellow Judges,

166
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,880
I was barely in my teens
when I put on this badge.

167
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,382
When the time comes for me
to take it off,

168
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:31,387
please let me do so knowing that
it still stands for freedom,

169
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:35,016
and not for repression.

170
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,894
Fifty-three hospitalized.

171
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:41,522
Nineteen dead, four of them
killed by a gang of squatters

172
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,943
who were themselves killed in
summary executions by Judge Dredd.

173
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,780
As my special undercover
report continues,

174
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,950
I will take you behind the
scenes at the Halls of Justice

175
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:56,621
for a disturbing probe into
these recent riots and block wars.

176
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,499
Coincidence or deliberate?

177
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,042
Dredd!

178
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,587
Some people think working
these mean streets

179
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,589
has a dehumanizing effect on...

180
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,893
- Joseph.
- Chief Justice Fargo.

181
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,188
You may stand at ease, Joseph.

182
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,156
So, tell me.

183
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,786
Seven summary executions.
Were they necessary?

184
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,788
Unavoidable, sir.

185
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,040
Unavoidable.

186
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,459
Life doesn't mean much
to some people anymore.

187
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:48,423
- You'd see that if you weren't always...
- Lf I weren't what?

188
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,091
Always at the Academy, sir.

189
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:57,015
Oh! Don't you mean,
at the Academy wiping cadets' asses?

190
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,517
That's what they say
in the squad room, isn't it?

191
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,603
It's irrelevant. You set the standard, sir.

192
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:06,733
Now you do,
at least to many young cadets.

193
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,776
You're a legend.

194
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,987
Sir.

195
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,865
You remember your days
as a cadet, Joseph?

196
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,159
I remember what you taught me, sir.

197
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,704
You were my finest student.

198
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,041
So, I've drawn
a new assignment for you.

199
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,250
Starting tomorrow,

200
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,128
you're going to spend
two days a week at the Academy.

201
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,173
I'd be honored, sir.
Unarmed combat or marksmanship?

202
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,300
Ethics.

203
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,664
Wait here.

204
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,423
Remain still. Identify yourself.

205
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,842
Miller. Warden.

206
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,387
Voice sample recognized.
Thank you, Warden. System disarmed.

207
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,307
Why are you here?

208
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,684
Did you come for another chat?

209
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:27,021
Just a short one, I'm afraid. Duty calls.

210
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,065
Ah, duty!

211
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:34,445
Feeding these parasites here
at the public's expense?

212
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,030
Yeah.

213
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,699
You especially!

214
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,536
I don't cost anything.

215
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,705
I'm a ghost.

216
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,376
And we're both prisoners here.

217
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,797
You're behind your desk,
and I'm behind this.

218
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:58,261
What a clever reward from Fargo, huh?

219
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,054
I mean, considering the services.

220
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:04,892
When you started killing
innocent people, Rico,

221
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,311
you went beyond service.

222
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:11,566
The innocent exist only until they
inevitably become perpetrators,

223
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,693
like you.

224
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,573
Guilt and innocence

225
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,741
is a matter of timing.

226
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,410
Your...

227
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,788
Our mysterious benefactor

228
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,167
has sent you a package.

229
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:37,175
Deactivate shield. Autoguns only.

230
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,094
Autoguns reactivated, Warden Miller.

231
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,643
Hmm.

232
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:52,315
- What is that?
- It's an ancient puzzle,

233
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,609
that contains the meaning of life.

234
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,117
So, tell me, Rico,

235
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,287
what is the meaning of life?

236
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,625
It ends.

237
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,298
Stop! Computer!

238
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,760
Activate alarm!

239
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,139
Voice not recognized.
Guns are training.

240
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,390
Remain still.

241
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:35,524
Security, override and unlock!
Come on!

242
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:59,757
Kevlar 9 helmet and body armor.
Yours when you graduate.

243
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,512
Lawgiver 2.

244
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,264
Twenty-five-round side arm

245
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,183
with mission-variable
voice-programmed ammunition.

246
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,352
- Signal flare.
- Flare.

247
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,316
Yours if you graduate.

248
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,112
Mark 4 Lawmaster, improved model,

249
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,114
with dual on-board laser cannons,

250
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,366
vertical take-off
and landing flight capability.

251
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,493
Range, 500 kilometers.

252
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,038
- Men.
- Yes, sir.

253
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,541
Active.

254
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,835
Malfunction. Malfunction.

255
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,129
Malfunction.

256
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,547
Hmm?

257
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,095
Yours if you can ever get it to work.

258
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,560
All of these things
you see here are toys.

259
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:56,731
At the end of the day
when you're all alone in the dark,

260
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:02,528
the only thing that counts
is this, the Law.

261
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:08,701
And you will be alone
when you swear to uphold these ideals.

262
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:13,247
For most of us,
there's only death in the streets.

263
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,875
For the few of us that survive to old age,

264
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:20,087
the proud loneliness of the Long Walk.

265
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,174
A walk that every Judge must take

266
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,676
outside these city walls

267
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,346
into the unknown of the Cursed Earth.

268
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:32,183
And there spend
your last remaining days

269
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:36,270
taking law to the lawless.

270
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,858
This is what it means to be a Judge.

271
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:45,237
This is the commitment I expect.

272
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,949
Class dismissed.

273
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,328
Attention, all personnel.

274
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,830
Due to the recent disturbance
in Heavenly Haven,

275
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,959
there will be increased patrols
in Sector 4.

276
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,421
Please check with your commanders
to see if you are affected

277
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,632
by these scheduled changes.

278
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,551
I can hear you thinking.

279
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,472
I caught your lecture today.

280
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,974
Is that really what you
think the cadets need to hear?

281
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,978
- What I told them is the truth.
- Your truth maybe.

282
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,481
You made it sound like our lives
are practically over.

283
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,484
Don't you think parts are, Hershey?

284
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,112
I have a personal life. I have friends.

285
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,072
You're one of the smartest
of the new breed,

286
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,172
but you've only been
on the street a year.

287
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,702
You haven't gotten used
to the isolation yet.

288
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:39,208
No. No, I don't think that's right.

289
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:42,128
No one is supposed
to be alone all the time.

290
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:46,549
I mean, is that really what
it's been like for you?

291
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:50,511
Don't you ever...
Haven't you ever had a friend?

292
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,723
Yes. Once.

293
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,559
What happened?

294
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,565
Dredd, wait.

295
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,359
I want to know. What happened?

296
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,737
I judged him.

297
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,208
Aspen shuttle has completed off-Ioading.

298
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,377
Cargo and morgue shipments
from Aspen.

299
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,712
Okay.

300
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,591
Let's get outta here.

301
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:05,211
Get your nose filters!
Get your nose filters!

302
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,549
Please select your fantasy now
and enjoy.

303
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,260
Who were themselves killed

304
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,472
in summary executions
by Judge Dredd.

305
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,682
As my special
undercover report continues,

306
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:22,269
I will take you behind the scenes
at the Halls of Justice.

307
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,955
We're closed for the night.

308
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:47,336
You're holding a package for me.
The code name is Lazarus.

309
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,047
I'll just be a second.

310
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,346
You got a nice place.

311
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,475
Yeah. A lot of this is antiques.

312
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:06,438
I thought they destroyed all these
A.B.C. Warriors during the last war.

313
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,357
Well, you can still collect 'em

314
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:11,360
as long as they're nonfunctioning,
like my wife.

315
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,573
These must be 50 or 60 years old now.

316
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,283
Anyway,

317
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:21,078
there you go.

318
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,673
- Hey, wait a second! Don't touch it.
- Why is that?

319
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,383
It's a Lawgiver.

320
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,553
That's programmed
to only recognize a Judge's hand.

321
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,305
You touch that, it'll take your arm off.

322
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,518
Gee, how do you like that?

323
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,979
I must be a Judge.

324
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,930
Happy birthday.

325
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,944
Status?

326
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,035
Bodyguard.

327
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,539
- Commander?
- Rico.

328
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:51,293
- Mission?
- Mission?

329
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,753
We're going to war.

330
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,881
War.

331
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:04,640
I followed up some grumblings
confirming a suspicion of mine.

332
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:08,352
The cancer of oppression goes
far deeper than the Street Judges.

333
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,938
- You're going to say that over the air?
- It's the truth!

334
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:14,274
- Oh, Vardas, you're insane.
- I'm a reporter.

335
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,819
They're never going to let
this get onto the air.

336
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,446
Something like this could
bring down the Council.

337
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,531
Maybe it should.

338
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:24,034
The whole system is the problem,
not just Judge...

339
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,704
Dredd. No!

340
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,470
Judge Hershey, corner
of Burns and Allen. Level "D."

341
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,807
Possible D.U.I. May need assistance.

342
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:51,145
Here we go!

343
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:56,024
- Step out of the car, please.
- What the hell's the problem now?

344
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:59,653
Get out of the car! Unicard, please.

345
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,283
Did you hear me? Unicard!

346
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,829
Mr. Souza.

347
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,707
You have a suspended license.

348
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,542
You've got three counts
of driving under the influence.

349
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,835
Hey, you better listen.

350
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:18,213
I suggest you walk away
and bother somebody else.

351
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,133
When I said I have powerful friends,
I mean powerful!

352
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:25,304
- Are we having a problem, Hershey?
- Not at all. Nothing I can't handle.

353
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,473
Suspended license. Three D.U.I.'s.

354
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:31,852
Ah! This is getting boring.
Okay, so what's the tab? C'mon.

355
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,854
How much is this going to cost me?
You name your price.

356
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,439
Mmm.

357
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,733
Hershey, call Control for an H-wagon.

358
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:41,069
What? I don't believe it.
You're going to tow me?

359
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:44,323
Towing is for a first offense.
This is your fourth violation, bar breath.

360
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:47,075
- You're a menace. How do you plead?
- Not guilty.

361
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,870
I knew you'd say that.

362
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,080
- Wait a second. What are you doing?
- Grenade.

363
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,291
- Grenade.
- No!

364
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,423
Happy motoring.

365
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,720
- Subtle.
- Mmm-hmm.

366
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,556
Judge Joseph Dredd.

367
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,770
Dredd, you're under arrest.

368
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,606
What's the charge?

369
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,399
Murder.

370
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,989
Attention. Chief Justice Fargo

371
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,076
now entering maximum security area.

372
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,796
- Joseph.
- Sir.

373
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,760
- Is it true?
- I'm innocent.

374
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,180
The Council is said
to have irrefutable proof.

375
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,391
Do you believe that?

376
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,185
There is to be a full tribunal.

377
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,939
- A conviction means death.
- Do you believe that, sir?

378
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,449
I just needed to look
into your eyes for myself.

379
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,244
I'm sorry I asked.

380
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:16,623
I would never do anything
to disgrace you with the Council, sir.

381
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,918
I'll use every resource
to find out, Joseph.

382
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,756
Have you selected
someone to defend you?

383
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,510
- Judge Hershey.
- Hershey? Why a Street Judge?

384
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:32,848
At the Academy, she was at the top
of her class in interpretational law.

385
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:35,851
And I trust her.

386
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,020
The facts will come out at the tribunal.

387
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:41,106
I'll personally make sure of that.

388
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,983
Sir?

389
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,613
I'm sorry about this.

390
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,163
Dredd! No!

391
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,166
Play back.

392
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,336
Dredd! No!

393
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,672
Dredd! No!

394
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,637
Play back.

395
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,556
Stop video.

396
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,102
The video you have just seen
is prima facie evidence

397
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,605
that the defendant is guilty as charged.

398
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,982
Mark it "People's Exhibit A."

399
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,984
Objection, Your Honor.

400
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,819
This video is inadmissible as evidence.

401
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:32,866
- If I may be given a moment to explain?
- Please do.

402
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,536
I have an affidavit
from Nathan Olmeyer,

403
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,372
currently a junior at the Academy.

404
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,874
Cadet Olmeyer has been acknowledged

405
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:44,878
by every one of his instructors to be
an expert in digital and video graphics.

406
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:51,385
His affidavit states this surveillance
video is of such low definition,

407
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:55,013
no positive identification
can be made of the killer.

408
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,099
Your Honors,

409
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,559
we know that the uniform
of a Judge can be counterfeit

410
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,687
and that the badge can be duplicated,

411
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,731
and since neither the video
nor the audio in this presentation

412
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,818
can identify the accused in any way,

413
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:11,863
I repeat my objection to this video
being allowed as evidence in this case,

414
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:14,157
and I ask for a ruling.

415
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,254
Objection sustained.

416
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,257
The video is inadmissible.

417
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,925
Yes!

418
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,593
Shh.

419
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,596
Admit it, Dredd.

420
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,932
- What?
- You're impressed.

421
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,102
- Very.
- You owe me.

422
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,312
- Hmm.
- Very well.

423
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,314
I'm therefore forced to move

424
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,817
to technical information
of a critical nature.

425
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,472
I will need the court's permission

426
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:55,449
to access top-secret documentation

427
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,617
with the help of Central Computer Bank.

428
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,286
You may proceed.

429
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,621
Central, are you on-line?

430
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,665
On-line, Judge McGruder.

431
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,626
I wish you to access
weapons schematic.

432
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:11,006
Describe the working of the standard
Judge's side arm, the Lawgiver 2.

433
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,551
Model 2 is coded to the personal D.N.A.

434
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,553
Of the Judge using the weapon

435
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:19,973
via the skin's contact with the grip,
a fail-safe security...

436
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,309
- Did you know about this?
- No!

437
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,895
The D.N.A. Is obtained
from my medical files,

438
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:28,982
and upgraded automatically
every time the weapon is reloaded.

439
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,485
Each time a round
is chambered and fired,

440
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,863
the projectile is tagged
with the relevant D.N.A.

441
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:38,492
Chief Justice, the defense was not
made aware of any of this information.

442
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:42,704
Judge Hershey, the prosecution
must be given time to finish.

443
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:52,005
Central, were the bullets recovered from
the bodies of Vardas and Lily Hammond

444
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,216
so D.N.A. Coded?

445
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,845
Yes, Judge McGruder.
It could not be otherwise.

446
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,682
And what was the result
of the computer check

447
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,644
of the D.N.A. Coding on those bullets?

448
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,521
The D.N.A. Is a perfect match

449
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,106
for Judge Joseph Dredd.

450
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,400
It's a lie!
The evidence has been falsified.

451
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:17,114
It's impossible!
I never broke the Law! I am the Law!

452
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:20,826
- We have no case.
- You gotta believe me!

453
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,829
You have to believe me. Say it.

454
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:29,084
Your Honor, the prosecution rests.

455
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,925
The Tribunal needs to confer!

456
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,936
What have I done?
How could I have been so wrong?

457
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,064
Dredd! Both of them homicidal.

458
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,153
Only this time it will be
impossible to cover up.

459
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,864
Chief Justice,

460
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:03,034
we carefully buried the Janus project
nine years ago,

461
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:06,538
along with Rico and all his victims.

462
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,416
No one will ever learn
of your involvement.

463
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:12,085
The media knows
how close I am to Dredd.

464
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,797
They'll dig until
the whole truth comes out.

465
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:19,426
It's the perfect excuse to ruin
what government we have left.

466
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,595
Your motives were pure.

467
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,847
You thought Dredd was different.
That's why you spared him.

468
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,850
A mistake which may bring
down the judicial system.

469
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,777
There is a way out, Chief Justice.

470
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,738
If you will forgive me.

471
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,615
The Long Walk.

472
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:49,956
That's a death sentence,
Judge Griffin. Mine.

473
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,169
Your retirement grants you
the power to save Dredd's life!

474
00:36:56,172 --> 00:37:01,009
This gesture may also allow Janus

475
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,511
to remain a secret.

476
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,772
In the charge of premeditated murder,

477
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,816
this tribunal finds Joseph Dredd

478
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,737
guilty as charged.

479
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,367
Joseph Dredd,

480
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:30,664
you're aware the law allows
only one punishment for your crime.

481
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,832
Death.

482
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,795
However, it has long been our custom

483
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:41,841
to carry out the last order
of a retiring Senior Judge.

484
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,012
And so,

485
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,019
I step down.

486
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,980
No!

487
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,318
As I leave,

488
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,780
to take my Long Walk
into the Cursed Earth,

489
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:08,868
I ask that this court honor my last order.

490
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:15,542
Be lenient with Judge Dredd
in gratitude for his years of service.

491
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,379
We will so honor this one, Judge Fargo.

492
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,762
Dredd, step forward.

493
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,560
The sentence shall be life imprisonment

494
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:37,063
at Aspen Penal Colony,
to be carried out immediately

495
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,232
as it is written!

496
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,152
Justice Griffin,
this trial has been a farce!

497
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,445
I demand an appeal!

498
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:46,865
You will accept the court's decision,
Judge Hershey!

499
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,381
Dredd, I'm so sorry.

500
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,592
I let you down.

501
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,764
You did your best, Hershey. Thank you.

502
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,434
Let the betrayer of the Law

503
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,895
be taken from our courts.

504
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,648
Let his armor be taken from him,

505
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,650
and all his garb ofjustice.

506
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:29,532
Let him be stricken from our hearts
and our memory forever.

507
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:43,380
Let his name be recorded
in every place of honor.

508
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,803
Let him take the Law he served so well

509
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,972
to those who have it not.

510
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,937
Let him be written

511
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:04,484
in our hearts and our memories forever.

512
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,366
Attention, all Judges.

513
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,535
You are reminded...

514
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,454
Judge Hershey.

515
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,347
It's gotta be here some...

516
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,065
What's this?

517
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:29,903
Baby Dredd?

518
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:32,489
I can't believe you were ever a baby.

519
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,077
Who's this?

520
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,681
Chief Justice Griffin.

521
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,731
It's got a nice ring to it.

522
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,484
We were supposed
to meet someplace safe!

523
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:22,288
What's not safe?
Your reporter's dead, right?

524
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,333
Fargo's on his Walk.

525
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,794
Dredd's in Aspen.

526
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,838
So, what's not safe?

527
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,715
It's unfortunate.

528
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:38,763
Hammond had to be silenced.
He found out about Janus.

529
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:42,809
- But I could've used Dredd.
- Forget Dredd!

530
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:45,144
There is no Dredd!

531
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:48,106
Let me tell you what Dredd worships.

532
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,066
He worships the Law!

533
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,651
He'd have blown you away

534
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,320
the minute he found out
how much you're pissin' on it.

535
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:01,786
Yeah. Let him see what it's like
to freeze his ass off in Aspen.

536
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,830
Let him see what it's like to be me!

537
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,418
There's a lot of work to be done.

538
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:12,589
Janus. Well, where is it?

539
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,674
- You'll see it!
- When?

540
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:15,967
Soon enough!

541
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,894
In the meantime, I want chaos, Rico.

542
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,773
That block war was just the beginning.

543
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:35,069
Now I want fear
racing through every street!

544
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,573
And the Council will have to turn to me.

545
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,034
And to Janus!

546
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,201
You want fear?

547
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,204
I'm fear.

548
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:48,583
You want chaos? I'm the chaos.

549
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:52,295
You want a new beginning?
Here! I am the new beginning!

550
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,432
This is Aspen Shuttle CF-188.

551
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:09,020
Due to storm cloud activity over the
desert, we will be flying at 60 feet.

552
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:12,565
Flight time approximately four hours.

553
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:34,212
Dredd? Don't hit me. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Don't hurt me.

554
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:37,173
What are you doing here?

555
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:41,302
I was convicted of a crime.
Wrongly convicted.

556
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,225
Really? That's kinda weird.

557
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,060
What are the odds?

558
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:53,231
Two wrongly-convicted guys
sittin' right next to each other.

559
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,609
You received the sentence
the Law required.

560
00:44:56,652 --> 00:45:01,489
Five years just for saving my own ass?

561
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,574
That was a mistake!

562
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,327
The Law doesn't make mistakes.

563
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:11,374
Really? Then how do you explain
what happened to you?

564
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,089
You can't, can you?

565
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:23,219
Great! Mr. "I am the Law" can't.

566
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,597
So, maybe, this is some kind of typo.

567
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,142
Maybe it's a glitch.

568
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:32,687
Or maybe it's poetic justice!

569
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,323
Shuttle comin'! Shuttle! Shuttle!

570
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:47,952
Shuttle comin', Pa! Look!

571
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:55,418
Praise the Lord for bringing us
this generous bounty.

572
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:59,756
My sons, gather the harvest.

573
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,638
So maybe you're here
as some sort of field trip.

574
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,099
Yeah!

575
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,060
Maybe this is some
sort of surprise party.

576
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:16,856
Whoo! Gonna catch me some city boy!

577
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:25,031
It's payback time, Dredd!

578
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,093
Dredd, what's happening?

579
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,476
By a blast of God they perish.

580
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:58,189
And by a breath of His nostrils
are they consumed.

581
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,192
Hallelujah!

582
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,663
Central, I need you to
access graphics database.

583
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,582
I want you to run an I.D. On this man.

584
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,252
Scanning for identity. Unknown male,

585
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:23,589
approximately 200 centimeters tall,
skin tone three.

586
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,675
Ten, nine, eight...

587
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,304
Central? Hello?

588
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:34,350
This terminal has been
terminated from the main system.

589
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:37,603
Your authority has been removed,
Judge Hershey.

590
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:48,072
This is Group Leader.
We've located the shuttle.

591
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,293
This is Capture Team.
There's no sign of Dredd.

592
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,962
He appears to have survived the crash.

593
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,755
You are in error, Capture Team.

594
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,465
No one survived the shuttle wreck.

595
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,759
Understand? Just find Dredd!

596
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:11,137
The pilot, sir. He's alive.

597
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:14,557
No one survived the shuttle wreck!
Do I make myself clear?

598
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:15,933
Yes, sir.

599
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:33,993
Am I dead?

600
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,163
Am I dead? I'm dead!

601
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,755
Awake!

602
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,089
Good!

603
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:50,301
We're running out of sinners.

604
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,971
Oh, my God!

605
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:03,689
- Dredd, do something!
- Dredd?

606
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,108
You talk too much.

607
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:08,945
Can it be?

608
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:25,753
The great man of the Law himself.

609
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:36,097
O Lord, you have blessed us indeed!

610
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:41,102
Judge "Rat" Dredd.

611
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,229
You creeps are under arrest.

612
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:44,897
Is that so?

613
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:47,692
Let me crush him, Pa.

614
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,611
Excuse me. We're not together.

615
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,824
Allow me to introduce you to my family.

616
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:58,202
- There's Link, my oldest.
- Bite me!

617
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,412
Hi!

618
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,747
My youngest, Junior.

619
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,916
- Howdy.
- Hi!

620
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,254
And this here is Mean.

621
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:12,466
We had to make some alterations
when he was a child.

622
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,720
The Cursed Earth's
a tough place on young folks.

623
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:20,599
I now have him set on one.
I don't suggest you make him angry.

624
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,729
The legendary Angel family.

625
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:28,149
Cursed Earth pirates,

626
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:31,527
murderers, scavengers.

627
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:37,033
- And, of course, scumbags.
- Oh, that'll win 'em over!

628
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:40,202
Did I leave something out, Pa?

629
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,607
- Let me kill 'im, Pa. I want his ears.
- I want his teeth.

630
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:53,299
Does that come with a fork, handsome?

631
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,893
Hallelujah, brother!

632
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,395
Wait a minute. Can it be?

633
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,398
Can it be that from the city of the fallen,

634
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,359
- we have one of the faithful?
- Amen, brother!

635
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:17,323
- Praise the Lord! I'm a believer!
- Fergie, don't do it.

636
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,867
It sounds like we have
a believer in the gallery.

637
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,744
- Yes!
- Cut him down!

638
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,996
- Go tell it on the mountain!
- Fergie.

639
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,753
You're making a big mistake.

640
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,006
Well, Dredd, maybe the Law
doesn't make mistakes,

641
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,343
but I'm free and you're toast.

642
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,804
Actually, you're toast.

643
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:41,889
I forgot to mention it.

644
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,891
Your new friends,

645
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:46,769
they're cannibals.

646
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,648
Fresh meat.

647
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,359
Prepare the supplicant for sacrifice.

648
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,653
No, wait. You can't eat me!

649
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:59,448
I've got eczema. I've got warts.
I've had gonorrhea.

650
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,534
Eat Dredd. He works out.

651
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,620
Yum, yum.

652
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:07,289
It's been fun, Lawman.

653
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,294
Finish Dredd.

654
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,798
My pleasure, Pa.

655
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,258
Come on.

656
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,598
Come on!

657
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,726
Come on, Junior!

658
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,396
Guilty!

659
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,568
Shut up!

660
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,118
Dredd, look out!

661
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,501
There's Dredd!

662
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,641
Go!

663
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,592
Well, we did it. We got 'em all.

664
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,637
- Hmm.
- Pussies! Is that all you got?

665
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,805
They are dead, right?

666
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,267
Have you been crying?

667
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,895
I'm not crying.
I got something in my eye.

668
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:55,356
You ever have allergies?
Dredd, look out!

669
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,826
Chief Justice!

670
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:11,038
Joseph, together again.

671
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,707
Together again, sir.

672
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,129
No!

673
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:27,554
God, not again!

674
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,937
You got three strikes, Lawman!

675
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,648
Strike one.

676
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:40,985
Strike two!

677
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,616
Strike three.

678
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,202
You're out, Lawman!

679
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:53,497
You killed Link! You killed Junior!

680
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,874
You killed my brothers!

681
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:58,502
You even killed my pa.

682
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:04,883
Mega City municipal code 4722,

683
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,511
illegal use of city electricity.

684
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,514
How do you plead?

685
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,766
I knew you'd say that!

686
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,191
Graphics analysis now.

687
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:25,612
Olmeyer, you stupid futz! I can't...

688
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,239
You analyzed the wrong viewie,
all right.

689
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,949
The wrong one. This one!

690
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:32,161
I don't believe it.
You just wasted three hours.

691
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:36,206
If this is the wrong picture,

692
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,667
why is it fake?

693
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,754
What?

694
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:46,216
Look. It's full of anomalies.
Really clever ones too.

695
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:48,594
Somebody must've used
a C.G.I. Terminal

696
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,804
and a scan quad to make this.

697
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:54,058
This is state-of-the-art,
twenty years ago.

698
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:57,227
Are you saying this isn't real?

699
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:00,564
Yeah. Look, I'll drop out
all the artificial pixels.

700
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:03,692
Dad. Mom.

701
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,278
Foreground.

702
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,406
Background. All fake.

703
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:13,952
The only thing that's real is the baby.

704
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:28,008
Oh. The blind lady.

705
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:31,887
Who is she?

706
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,556
Justice, before your time.

707
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:39,812
We should never have taken
justice out of her hands.

708
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,982
- You brought order to chaos, sir.
- That we did.

709
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:47,945
Solved many problems,
and created many more!

710
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:52,074
Being a Judge, Joseph,

711
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:56,286
perhaps too much power
in one person's hands.

712
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:01,959
We once tried to compensate,
create the perfect Judge.

713
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,503
We called it Janus.

714
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,631
Four decades ago,

715
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:11,510
D.N.A. Samples were taken
from the original Council.

716
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,471
One was chosen. Mine.

717
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,684
We altered it to enhance
the best qualities

718
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,270
and screen out the worst,

719
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:23,939
weaknesses, frailties.

720
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,943
We created you.

721
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,156
You didn't create me, sir.

722
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,868
- I have a family.
- No.

723
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:39,705
At the Academy, you told me they
were killed when I was very young.

724
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:40,956
A lie.

725
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,877
I have a picture of them.

726
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:48,297
A fake. We lied to both of you.

727
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,049
Both?

728
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:54,803
There was another infant
created in that experiment,

729
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,055
but something went wrong.

730
00:57:58,057 --> 00:58:01,393
Genetically mutated
to the perfect criminal.

731
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,354
I have a brother?

732
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:07,608
You were best friends at the Academy.
Star pupils.

733
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:12,571
And then he turned.
And for his crimes, you judged him.

734
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,658
Rico?

735
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,037
Rico.

736
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:26,752
You let me judge my own brother?
You never told me, sir.

737
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:27,836
I couldn't!

738
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,552
You were like a son to me!

739
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,095
A son.

740
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:41,600
My whole life is a lie.

741
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:47,940
Rico had to be executed to protect you,
to protect the city.

742
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:48,524
Rico.

743
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:55,989
He's alive!

744
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:57,950
No.

745
00:58:57,992 --> 00:59:00,035
I signed the order myself.

746
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:03,372
- I saw the report.
- I didn't kill Hammond.

747
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,457
It was him.

748
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,544
It was his D.N.A. That convicted me.

749
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:11,171
Griffin. It was Griffin.

750
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,131
Griffin, yes.

751
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:16,969
We've both been deceived, Joseph.
I'm so sorry.

752
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:20,347
Rico's killed me and destroyed you!

753
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,642
Find him, Joseph.

754
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:25,811
Don't die.

755
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:17,904
What do we do?

756
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,450
Find Rico.

757
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,541
Welcome to Janus.

758
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:35,297
Rico, I think you know Dr. Hayden.

759
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:37,049
I remember you.

760
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:40,218
Testified before the Council
that I was insane, right?

761
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:44,097
- And therefore innocent.
- I was trying to save your life.

762
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:47,643
What you did was insult me,
'cause I knew exactly what I was doing.

763
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,186
Then and now.

764
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:07,245
Miss Hayden has been a loyal
supporter of this project for a long time.

765
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,580
She's kept it alive for me.

766
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:12,084
I'm sure you'll find
her expertise invaluable.

767
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:13,752
Excuse me!

768
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,963
All this is useless if you can't get
into Central's Janus files,

769
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:19,132
'cause the Council has 'em locked.

770
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,676
Leave that to me.

771
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,012
Meanwhile you have work to do,
on the streets.

772
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:27,140
- Ilsa will help you.
- I don't need no help! Thanks.

773
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:33,772
I thought you said he was created here
by the finest scientists of Mega City.

774
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,108
A bold experiment.

775
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,278
He's a petulant child.

776
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,533
Let's not bicker.
We're here to achieve the same thing.

777
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,577
An ordered society.

778
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:53,166
You'll have your New Order.

779
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:59,047
Attention, all Judges.
Reporting unrest, code D-924.

780
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:02,300
Downtown, Sector 12.
Backup requested.

781
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:21,236
Nineteen different explosions
in 11 different sectors.

782
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:24,448
Extra caution to be taken
on approach to 914...

783
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,748
Search all areas bordering
the Elite Building.

784
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:35,208
The anonymous caller
did not specify capacity.

785
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:37,377
Proceed with caution.

786
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,024
My boy!

787
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:08,408
Dredd, there's no way in!

788
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,076
Hello?

789
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:12,954
Are you even listening to me?

790
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:17,167
We can't just knock on the wall
and say, "Hello, Cursed Earth Pizza."

791
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,503
There is a way in.

792
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:22,339
Six years ago,
two refugees figured it out.

793
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:26,426
It's a vent to the city's incinerator.
There's a burst twice a minute.

794
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,386
That means somebody
could run through that tube

795
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,056
and have 30 seconds
before it flames again.

796
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:36,394
And these refugees,
they made it through, right?

797
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,146
Actually, they were roasted.

798
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,399
But the theory's sound. Shall we?

799
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:45,904
Maybe we should consider other theories.
Dredd!

800
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:52,786
Dispatch, I'm in Green Quad 411.
Need a pickup.

801
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:56,081
Copy, Hershey.
I have Central on-line for you.

802
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:58,583
Patch it to my Lawmaster.

803
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:08,051
Warning.
Alien device on board.

804
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,762
Oh, my God!

805
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:17,769
Latest casualty report,
96 Judges have been assassinated!

806
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:20,438
Whoever's doing this seems
to know all our procedures,

807
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:22,899
our security measures,
even our scrambled frequencies.

808
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:24,102
With no Judges on the street,

809
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,152
riots are breaking out
all over Mega City.

810
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:28,446
We can't replace those Judges.

811
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:31,992
Even if we put the cadets on the street,
we won't be at full strength for years!

812
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:33,827
There is a solution.

813
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:39,249
Project Janus.

814
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:42,043
This Council tried
to play God once before.

815
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:45,046
If this wholesale slaughter
of Judges continues,

816
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,132
there won't be a Council.

817
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:50,051
- Janus could...
- Janus could what?

818
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:53,096
A new batch of test-tube babies
won't solve this crisis.

819
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,307
We don't need reliable Judges
20 years from now,

820
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:56,600
we need them today!

821
01:04:56,642 --> 01:05:00,937
Accelerated growth incubators
are more developed now.

822
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:05,567
We could create adult subjects.

823
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:10,655
All I'm asking is that
we unlock the Janus files.

824
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:13,450
That way we at least have an option!

825
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:17,662
If the Council decides not to go forward,

826
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:20,832
I'll accept that decision and resign.

827
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,345
- All right, you ready, kid?
- No!

828
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:36,222
- Now what's wrong?
- What's wrong? Are you kidding?

829
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:39,351
Did wearing that helmet all those years
compress your brain?

830
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,853
- You're gonna get me killed.
- There's a maniac loose in this city!

831
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,104
What a coincidence!

832
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:45,899
- There's one out here too!
- Oh.

833
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:47,609
Great time I'm having.

834
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:50,862
The shuttle crash,
the Cursed Earth, cannibals.

835
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,198
And now a fireball up my ass!

836
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:55,241
- This is all your fault!
- My fault?

837
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,369
- Yes!
- You care to explain that, citizen?

838
01:05:57,453 --> 01:06:00,872
If you hadn't arrested me,
I wouldn't be here in the first place.

839
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:03,375
Hey, Dredd, what if
you just kill me now?

840
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:09,381
That's it!
I'm through schlepping.

841
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:13,218
I'm gonna stay here until
I'm caught or 'til you apologize!

842
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:17,347
- The Law can't apologize!
- You're not the Law anymore.

843
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:20,517
Now apologize. I think I deserve that.

844
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,436
I've never apologized.

845
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,568
Now run!

846
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:33,905
Thirty, twenty-nine, twenty-eight,

847
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,408
- twenty-seven, twenty-six...
- Run!

848
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:40,412
Twenty-five, twenty-four,
twenty-three, twenty-two,

849
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:42,789
twenty-one, nineteen...

850
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:46,459
Dredd? Dredd!

851
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,964
Dredd! I don't wanna die!

852
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:01,516
Jump!

853
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:18,616
I'm alive!

854
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,910
Oh, so are you.

855
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,625
Esposito, Carlos. Council Judge.

856
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:32,088
Authorize access to file,
code name Janus.

857
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:35,800
Acknowledged.

858
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:40,972
McGruder, Evelyn. Authorize
access to file, code name Janus.

859
01:07:41,974 --> 01:07:43,808
Acknowledged.

860
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:45,935
Silver, Gerald.

861
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:49,147
Authorize access to file,
code name Janus.

862
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,316
Removing security blocks now.

863
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,986
Awaiting password command
from presiding Chief Justice.

864
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:57,280
Password, origin.

865
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:59,074
Janus file opened.

866
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:07,832
Attention.
Until emergency repairs are completed,

867
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:10,043
Ward "C" locker room is off limits.

868
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:15,256
I'm lost. Is this the bathroom?

869
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:17,509
Hey!

870
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:20,512
Now you have to admit,
I helped out on that one.

871
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:22,847
I mean, that was all me, baby!

872
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:26,434
Hey, hey...
Why are you taking off his clothes?

873
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:30,146
We don't have time for this.

874
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:36,820
Central, using current technology,

875
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:42,200
how long would it take for Janus to
produce a fully-grown adult subject?

876
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:45,036
Given the current state
of genetic engineering,

877
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:48,748
an adult subject could be incubated
in approximately eight hours.

878
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:53,336
- We could replace our losses in a day.
- This is madness.

879
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:55,213
Ah, Dredd?

880
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:56,714
- Silence.
- Dredd!

881
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:58,842
Shh. I'm busy.

882
01:08:58,884 --> 01:09:00,718
Dredd?

883
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:07,892
It's inhuman.
It's not for this Council to play God!

884
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:11,271
No, Griffin.
Please restore the security blocks.

885
01:09:11,355 --> 01:09:15,567
It seems none of you have the force
of will that these times require.

886
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:20,113
Central, leave Janus unlocked.

887
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:24,033
Griffin, this is treason.
You have just sealed your fate.

888
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:25,326
No!

889
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:29,747
You have just sealed yours! Rico!

890
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,847
Now who says politics is boring?

891
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:48,892
Hey, Dredd! I thought it was you.

892
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:51,144
That's right! Cover your ears!

893
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:58,443
- Rico.
- Joseph.

894
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,827
Get out of here, now!

895
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:11,247
No!

896
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:17,629
- You're under arrest, Griffin.
- Really?

897
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,472
Stop him!
He just killed the entire Council!

898
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:30,892
- Move it out!
- Dredd, tell them I'm innocent.

899
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:32,393
Whoa!

900
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:48,868
Come on, Fergie! Run!

901
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:51,871
You're a lot of fun to be with, Dredd.
You know that?

902
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,589
- What are you gonna do?
- Hope it works.

903
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:05,426
Malfunction.

904
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,031
What is wrong with this piece of shit?

905
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:18,898
That's a solid brick wall!
You're going to kill us!

906
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:30,034
Dredd! You gotta make it work!

907
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:31,786
Make it work!

908
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:34,330
Malfunction. Malfunction. On-line.

909
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:44,674
Dredd, you may want to wash this seat
after we get off the bike.

910
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:47,260
- Hmm.
- Sorry.

911
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,599
Dredd, move it!

912
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:11,909
- Fergie, cover the rear.
- I've never fired a gun in my life!

913
01:12:11,952 --> 01:12:15,455
- What kind of a criminal are you?
- A nice criminal.

914
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:22,086
- Nothing's happening!
- You gotta cock it first, moron.

915
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:24,172
You didn't say anything about cocking.

916
01:12:25,215 --> 01:12:26,424
Nice!

917
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:41,773
Stop! Please, God!

918
01:12:57,164 --> 01:12:59,123
You can drop me off here.

919
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,547
- Dredd, that's a dead end.
- I know.

920
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:30,988
Oh, God!

921
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:37,829
Fergie, take over!

922
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:40,164
Where are you going? Dredd!

923
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:42,333
This is where you get off, creep!

924
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:53,761
Need a lift, kid?

925
01:14:01,311 --> 01:14:02,872
I'm never riding with you again, Dredd!

926
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:18,161
She's definitely not gonna get her
cleaning deposit back, that's for sure.

927
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:24,417
It doesn't pay to be
one of your friends, Dredd. Sorry!

928
01:14:37,097 --> 01:14:40,099
Hands against the wall.
You know the drill.

929
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:43,978
- Who are you?
- Dredd said that...

930
01:14:44,062 --> 01:14:45,480
Shut up!

931
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:48,728
- What happened?
- Why don't you tell me, Dredd, huh?

932
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:52,737
We're dyin' out there!
108 Judges in 48 hours!

933
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:54,447
What the hell is going on?

934
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,284
You think I'm part of this?

935
01:14:58,368 --> 01:15:01,662
I don't know
who or what you are anymore.

936
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:12,048
I would never do anything
to hurt you, Hersh.

937
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,717
You know that.

938
01:15:20,098 --> 01:15:21,432
All right.

939
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:25,144
You tell me about him, huh?

940
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:29,941
You make me believe in you
like I did when I defended you.

941
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:31,817
His name is Rico,

942
01:15:33,153 --> 01:15:35,071
and he's my brother.

943
01:15:35,155 --> 01:15:38,449
The D.N.A. Sample has been
taken out of frozen stasis.

944
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:42,745
- Ready for cloning process.
- We got a slight change of plans here.

945
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:47,792
I want to take the existing
D.N.A. Sample right now and trash it.

946
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:51,546
Activate this D.N.A. Sampling console.

947
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:54,298
What are you doing?

948
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:58,636
Central, take this D.N.A. Sample now.

949
01:15:59,346 --> 01:16:01,430
This wasn't part of our plan!

950
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:03,975
Judge Griffin would never
have authorized this!

951
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:05,434
Processing.

952
01:16:05,477 --> 01:16:09,438
You know, Griffin got to be my keeper
by putting me behind bars.

953
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,402
What's your excuse?

954
01:16:17,322 --> 01:16:20,157
You said I had no feelings
and no emotions.

955
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:23,411
Now you know why.

956
01:16:23,495 --> 01:16:26,289
Dredd, look at me.

957
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:34,046
The Janus project didn't do that to you.
You did that to yourself.

958
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:37,842
Sorry, guys, I'm getting
nowhere with your terminal.

959
01:16:37,884 --> 01:16:41,262
But I fixed the microwave.
You want some popcorn?

960
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:43,848
Is this a bad time?

961
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:48,811
Look, I tried dialing everything I
could think of to find this Janus thing.

962
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:52,440
It just isn't in the program.
Nowhere. Nothing.

963
01:16:52,899 --> 01:16:55,359
They'd never take a chance
and put it on the computer network,

964
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:57,903
but they need power and they're
gonna steal it from somewhere.

965
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:01,032
Check every sector for recent blackouts
and sudden power surges.

966
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:03,159
- Great. Let's stay here longer!
- Wait a second.

967
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:06,704
Just before they blew up
my Lawmaster in Sector 4,

968
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:10,458
there was a power surge,
a really big one, three blocks wide.

969
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:12,585
The last time I felt something like that,

970
01:17:12,669 --> 01:17:15,004
they shut down the whole power grid
in that area, remember?

971
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:17,673
When they moved the Statue of Liberty,
they put it right down on top of it.

972
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:19,884
- Right.
- Could we go now?

973
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:23,512
Dredd, that's twice you owe me.

974
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:32,688
Rico! Dredd got away from the hunters.

975
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:35,691
Well, he's about to be
seriously outnumbered.

976
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:38,736
- Right, Central?
- Affirmative, Judge Rico.

977
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:41,072
The new D.N.A. Sample
has been multiplexed,

978
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:43,282
and the gametes are already dividing.

979
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:45,076
New sample?

980
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,453
You left that D.N.A.
In there for over 30 years!

981
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:49,872
Sooner or later, somebody's
gonna clean out the fridge.

982
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:54,585
That sample was created from the finest
specimens on the Council of Judges!

983
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:57,088
What did you replace it with?

984
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,508
No. My God.

985
01:18:01,134 --> 01:18:04,428
You should congratulate me right now,
'cause I'm about to be a daddy.

986
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,764
You're being very, very rude.

987
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:08,766
You don't know what you're doing!

988
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:12,770
The next batch of Janus Judges are not
going to be the puppets that you want!

989
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:16,273
They're gonna be my brothers
and sisters! And mine to control!

990
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:20,611
I can't let you do this.
You're both insane! I have to stop...

991
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:29,495
Central, help me!

992
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:32,331
I'm sorry, Chief Justice,
the A.B.C. Robot

993
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:34,834
is not tied into my main processor.

994
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:38,587
That's right, Griff.
You gotta get with this high-tech stuff.

995
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:42,174
- Robot, rip his arms and legs off.
- No!

996
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:45,302
And you save his head for last.
I don't want him to miss anything!

997
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:47,388
- Anything!
- No!

998
01:18:51,476 --> 01:18:54,228
- Fergie, you stay here.
- By myself?

999
01:18:54,312 --> 01:18:57,398
You'll need me to shut down
the Janus system. We're a team.

1000
01:18:57,482 --> 01:19:00,192
Granted, you do most of the work,
but we're still a team.

1001
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:02,778
- I'll handle it, kid.
- I bring you luck.

1002
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:06,407
- Luck?
- You are still alive, Dredd.

1003
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:08,159
Hmm.

1004
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:26,844
I'm getting a signal.

1005
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:31,474
It's close. It's moving closer!

1006
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:34,810
Jesus Christ!

1007
01:19:35,353 --> 01:19:36,645
Get back!

1008
01:19:39,816 --> 01:19:41,233
No!

1009
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:45,279
Dredd!

1010
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:55,664
Drop the gun.

1011
01:19:58,543 --> 01:20:01,337
Robot, on the count of three,
break her neck.

1012
01:20:01,713 --> 01:20:03,214
One, two...

1013
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:04,340
No!

1014
01:20:10,263 --> 01:20:12,890
- Hershey?
- I'm still here.

1015
01:20:13,725 --> 01:20:17,102
How romantic. Step inside.

1016
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:31,075
He looks a lot like you.

1017
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:32,952
He is a lot like me.

1018
01:20:33,703 --> 01:20:35,871
I am nothing like you.

1019
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:37,873
The only difference
between us, Joseph,

1020
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:41,377
is you destroyed your life
to embrace the Law.

1021
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:45,047
And I destroyed the Law to embrace life.

1022
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:52,137
And speaking of life, send in the clones.

1023
01:20:57,727 --> 01:20:58,936
Behold!

1024
01:21:15,495 --> 01:21:17,955
This is where you were born.

1025
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:19,707
Feel that magic?

1026
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:23,711
But you must've known all along

1027
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,839
you were different.

1028
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:34,763
Fergie, are you still alive?

1029
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:37,766
Technically, yes.

1030
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:46,317
Your brothers and your sisters.

1031
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:48,402
Be born in two hours.

1032
01:21:48,486 --> 01:21:52,406
One big, endless supply of perfection.

1033
01:21:54,367 --> 01:21:55,826
You know, we have a choice.

1034
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,494
We can stand here right now

1035
01:21:57,579 --> 01:21:59,997
and create a whole race
of brainwashed morons,

1036
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:01,540
and call them Judges.

1037
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:04,209
Or we can create
some freethinking people.

1038
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:07,254
We'll call them human.

1039
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:10,507
Human.

1040
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:16,013
You could never control yourself.

1041
01:22:17,349 --> 01:22:20,851
What makes you think you
can control these things?

1042
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:22,686
'Cause you're in control.

1043
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,440
You be head of the Council.

1044
01:22:26,858 --> 01:22:31,153
You choose,
and you choose quickly too.

1045
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:35,991
I should've put you down myself,
personally!

1046
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:38,786
You know, I never understood that.

1047
01:22:38,995 --> 01:22:43,082
Why did you judge me?
Why did you judge me?

1048
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:45,209
- You killed innocent people.
- The means to an end.

1049
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:47,294
- You started a massacre.
- I caused a revolution.

1050
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:50,381
- You betrayed the Law!
- Law!

1051
01:22:50,423 --> 01:22:53,258
I betrayed this!

1052
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:57,554
Your Council's experiment,
which failed in you!

1053
01:22:59,265 --> 01:23:00,985
I was your brother,
your blood, your friend.

1054
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,436
Who betrayed who?

1055
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:07,815
When are you gonna stop
being a goddamn slave and grow up?

1056
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:10,025
That's your birthright, that's your family.

1057
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:13,570
I'm your family.
I'm the only family you ever had!

1058
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:16,490
Now choose!

1059
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:24,081
The best thing you can do is kill me.

1060
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:26,667
Why?

1061
01:23:26,751 --> 01:23:32,047
Because it's your only chance brother.

1062
01:23:33,591 --> 01:23:34,758
Fido!

1063
01:23:37,762 --> 01:23:40,431
Rip this bitch's arms and legs off.

1064
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:42,975
- Save her pretty head for my brother.
- Don't do it!

1065
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:44,852
Halt!

1066
01:23:46,312 --> 01:23:48,981
Rip his head off instead. Give it to her.

1067
01:23:53,945 --> 01:23:55,946
What's the matter with you?

1068
01:23:56,948 --> 01:23:58,073
Rico!

1069
01:24:01,911 --> 01:24:03,787
- Boy, is he pissed!
- Fergie!

1070
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:07,750
Dredd!

1071
01:24:10,086 --> 01:24:12,463
- Get him, Dredd!
- Hang on, Fergie.

1072
01:24:17,635 --> 01:24:19,303
Hack you, asshole.

1073
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:22,848
Rico!

1074
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:27,311
Central, hatch that first set of clones.

1075
01:24:27,353 --> 01:24:29,396
The cloning process is not
finished, Judge Rico.

1076
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:31,857
The clones will be only 60% complete.

1077
01:24:31,941 --> 01:24:35,819
I need reinforcements.
Hatch the goddamn clones now!

1078
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:50,375
Don't fight much, do you?

1079
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:29,581
Bitch!

1080
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:32,543
It's Judge Bitch!

1081
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:23,969
I'm the only one who never lied to you.

1082
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:26,513
I'll be the judge of that.

1083
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:57,127
Now, Joseph Dredd,
I hereby judge you.

1084
01:26:58,671 --> 01:27:03,592
To the charge of betraying
your flesh, guilty.

1085
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:09,473
To the charge of being human,
when we could have been Gods, guilty.

1086
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:12,809
The sentence is death.

1087
01:27:12,852 --> 01:27:14,311
Don't miss.

1088
01:27:15,438 --> 01:27:17,648
Lethal round is exhausted.

1089
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:22,611
Signal flare!

1090
01:27:26,282 --> 01:27:27,866
Court is adjourned.

1091
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:42,256
Dredd.

1092
01:27:59,315 --> 01:28:00,357
Give me your hand.

1093
01:28:01,442 --> 01:28:03,694
That's three times now, Dredd.

1094
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:19,001
Stay in back, Hershey.

1095
01:28:23,214 --> 01:28:26,842
- Am I under arrest?
- That won't be necessary.

1096
01:28:26,884 --> 01:28:29,970
Central broadcast the Janus plan
after Griffin's death.

1097
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:31,972
They all know the truth.

1098
01:28:32,223 --> 01:28:35,726
Judge Dredd, we have
to reconstitute the Council.

1099
01:28:35,893 --> 01:28:40,480
We'd like you to consider
the first position of Chief Justice.

1100
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:43,692
I'm a Street Judge.

1101
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:47,529
And I'm very late for work.
Thank you, Olmeyer.

1102
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:52,200
I am dying. I'm too young... Excuse me.

1103
01:28:52,243 --> 01:28:54,453
Oh, that's great! He gets all the credit.

1104
01:28:54,537 --> 01:28:55,704
Dredd?

1105
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:58,415
I taught him everything he knows.

1106
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:01,043
Dredd, that's it?

1107
01:29:03,796 --> 01:29:05,213
No good-bye?

1108
01:29:05,256 --> 01:29:07,007
Good-bye, Hershey.

1109
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:18,435
To tell you the truth,
I'm probably a much better kisser.

1110
01:29:18,478 --> 01:29:22,230
Ow! Okay, come on, let's go, will ya?
Can we swing by a cash machine?

1111
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:34,618
Feels good to be human,
don't you think?

1112
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:36,661
I knew you'd say that.

1113
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:27,045

1114
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:30,549

Believe

1148
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:26,683
In

1149
01:33:26,726 --> 01:33:28,893
You

1150
01:34:17,443 --> 01:34:22,530
If it's all we've got

1151
01:34:22,573 --> 01:34:28,370
Then never let it go

1152
01:34:28,412 --> 01:34:33,917
We spend our time in darkness

1153
01:34:33,959 --> 01:34:36,836
Searching for the light

1154
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:45,095
If you lose your own way

1155
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:50,809
You never get it right

1156
01:34:50,893 --> 01:34:55,855
- Daytime, I mean
- Yeah

1157
01:34:55,940 --> 01:35:00,568
Put your time away

1158
01:35:00,611 --> 01:35:08,611
- All we've got is time
- So never let it go

1159
01:35:11,622 --> 01:35:16,751
If I can make it right

1160
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:20,213
Time

1161
01:35:20,297 --> 01:35:28,297
- All I've got is time
- So never let it go

1162
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:36,813
If I can make it right

1163
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:45,905
- Time
- All we've got is time
