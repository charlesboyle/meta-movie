1
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,784
...more airwaves silent and most
explosions in the Iraqi capital.

2
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:39,079
Further explosions
are unfolding in Tikrit,

3
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,210
which is Saddam Hussein's
ancestral hometown.

4
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:46,214
...as well as blows from similar
explosions are unfolding...

5
00:00:46,215 --> 00:00:51,135
Just a few seconds ago, another
huge blast shook this city.

6
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,804
Cruise missiles and
airstrikes raining down here

7
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:57,724
in a relentless assault
on Baghdad.

8
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:01,269
There is no doubt tonight
that war has begun...

9
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,190
...and the Iraqi capital
is experiencing shock and awe.

10
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:52,338
Approaching
target site three-five-niner.

11
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,094
All right, everybody,
listen up.

12
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,555
It is a military
storage site. Diwaniya.

13
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,101
Intel estimates possible nerve
agents, choking agents,

14
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,728
live pathogens,
chemical-tipped missiles.

15
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,356
101 st has been here all
morning, so the site is secure.

16
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,400
Everybody stay focused.
This is it.

17
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,954
Shots fired, right side,
100 meters, tops.

18
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:28,374
We got shots fired.
Right side, 100 meters.

19
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,721
Let's go.
Move. Move!

20
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,224
Okay. Go ahead.

21
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,685
Who's the officer
in charge?

22
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:48,811
Move! Move! Move!

23
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,396
Hey! Who's in charge?

24
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,898
Right here.
Lieutenant Asira.

25
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,024
Chief Miller,
Met-Delta.

26
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,942
What the fuck are all
these looters doing here?

27
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,154
This is a WMD site.
This is a high-priority site.

28
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,948
Look, I don't even have enough
men to set up the perimeter.

29
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,825
We got a sniper
in this tower right here.

30
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,118
In the big tower
on the back?

31
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,202
In the big tower
on the back.

32
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,205
I do not have enough men to go in and
secure the inside of that compound.

33
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,918
Listen, listen. Intel says we got
live chemical agents in this site.

34
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,170
Okay, we gotta move
now! These looters...

35
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,631
I don't know what these people
are carrying out right now.

36
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,674
I gotta get into this site.
I'm going in.

37
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,176
Chief, you can't go in.

38
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,762
If you take your team in
right now, it's on you.

39
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,973
Gather around. Gather around. Come on.
Listen, here's the situation.

40
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,601
101 st sent 35 men and
one butter bar down here.

41
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,436
They don't even have
this place secure, so

42
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,854
here's where
we are right now.

43
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,690
Now, the weapons are in the
northwest end of the complex.

44
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,026
There's a sniper holed up
in the big tower there.

45
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,903
We're going to have
to quickly take him out.

46
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:42,156
I'm going to take a recon element forward.
I'm going to need C-BIST.

47
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,741
Marshall and Johnson, you come with me.
Yes, sir.

48
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,786
Two shooters, Potts, Michaels.
I'm going to need EOD.

49
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,245
Conway, bring Simms also.
Right here, sir.

50
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,581
Ready, Chief.
All right, stand by.

51
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,501
Chief, I gotta talk to you.
This is fucked.

52
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:54,877
Listen, this is
a disaster.

53
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,004
It is a disaster.
They haven't secured dick.

54
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,840
I don't think we should go in yet, Chief.
Let's get some acceptable intel.

55
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:03,010
No, no, no. Look at this! Jerry, I
got no idea what's coming out here.

56
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,137
I gotta go right now.

57
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,681
Keep comms open.
I'll be on five.

58
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:09,058
Get a second team ready.

59
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,393
Let's go! Move! Move!

60
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:11,936
Guys, get that shit
off the truck now.

61
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,896
Roger that.

62
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:14,981
Right here, Chief.

63
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,441
I want you to stay right on the
backs of your shooters, all right?

64
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,235
They will take you in.
Roger that, Chief.

65
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,319
All right. We ready?

66
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,738
Yes, sir!
Let's go. Go! Go! Go!

67
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,740
Move! Move!

68
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:28,160
The sniper! Hey, Sarge!
Where is he?

69
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:32,122
He's right up there, but we
can't get down the alley.

70
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,759
Okay, everyone,
listen up.

71
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,095
Michaels! Michaels,
listen. Hey!

72
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:51,142
The WMD are in this building. I need you
to work your way to the rear door here.

73
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,852
See if you can get
an angle on that sniper.

74
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,438
I want you to take C-BIST with you.
Take Simms, also, with the long rifle.

75
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,605
Got it, Chief.

76
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,607
Hey, I gotta get
across this alley.

77
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,859
I need some
cover fire, all right?

78
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,985
Okay.

79
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:04,530
When the 203 goes, we're going to go
all the way down on the left side.

80
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,865
All right. Stand by.
Roger that, Chief.

81
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,533
Let's go.

82
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:12,037
Met-Delta team, go!

83
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,290
Move, move! Let's go!

84
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,587
Move! Move!

85
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:39,273
I got him. He's on the fifth
floor, southeast corner room.

86
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,651
I'm going to draw him out.

87
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,779
As soon as you see him,
take him.

88
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,280
Roger.

89
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,579
Now! Now! Now!

90
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,381
Got him?

91
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,383
We got him.
Three coming out.

92
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,843
Michaels,
send C-BIST over.

93
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,761
Go! Go! Go!

94
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,183
Potts, Keating, go! Go!

95
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,940
Second team, move!
Let's go! Move! Move!

96
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,816
Move it!

97
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,030
In.

98
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,828
Check. Check.
Let's do it.

99
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:37,498
All right. Break out the gear.
I want everyone in full MOPP.

100
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:41,376
Now you heard Chief. Get ready.
Roll those seals tight.

101
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,378
I got it.

102
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:26,088
No readings in here, Chief.

103
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,049
All right,
Conway, open it up.

104
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,191
Nothing but
toilet parts over here.

105
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,652
Is this all pigeon shit?

106
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,614
Yeah, thing looks like it's
been here about 10 years.

107
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,115
Yep.

108
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,661
This is no WMD site.

109
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,372
Pack it up.

110
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,750
Hey Chief,
we find anything?

111
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,961
The site's empty.

112
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,004
Standing by.

113
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,977
Hey, where did that
intel come from?

114
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,480
Do you want me to double check the
target number for you? Because I can.

115
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,650
No, no, we're in the right location.
The schematic's right.

116
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,526
But who did it
originate with? I mean...

117
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,737
Hey, did this come
from the United Nations?

118
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:35,407
According to this data,
Chief, this is our intel.

119
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,370
Yeah, but how would they
think something was there?

120
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,999
This is the third
straight time.

121
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:45,751
Let's go.

122
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,962
- You heard the chief.
- Move out.

123
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:49,463
All right, pack this shit up
and let's go.

124
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,506
Roger that!

125
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,632
Let's go! Move!

126
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,010
Step on it. Let's go.

127
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,945
Zubaidi will be on the middle chopper.
Get tight on his exit.

128
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,834
Swing it around.
Swing it around.

129
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,085
The DOD guy's
here to meet him.

130
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,549
Reporting to you live
from the tarmac here...

131
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,932
Ready for the
close-up? Go, go, go!

132
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,601
That's Poundstone from DOD.

133
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,645
How's it going?

134
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,147
Great day.

135
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,607
Yup, you finally got him here.

136
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:54,069
Well, we feel like we're making progress.
That's important.

137
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,613
So, what about
the weapons?

138
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,867
I'm frustrated by that, too.

139
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,828
We're doing everything we can. We'll
find the weapons, don't worry about it.

140
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,956
The whole world's watching. They
want to know where they are.

141
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:08,751
Make sure Zubaidi and I are
in the lead car, okay?

142
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,085
Jack, I want
your guys to tail us.

143
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,211
You got it, sir.

144
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,671
Clark!
What?

145
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,757
I need the source.
I need Magellan.

146
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,636
Do you have any idea
how sensitive this is?

147
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:23,974
We've got Magellan locked up so tight,
I'm not even sure I can get to him.

148
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:28,228
You're the administration's go-to guy
and you can't access your own source?

149
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,314
Lawrie, we're
debriefing him.

150
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,816
It takes time.
That comes first.

151
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,487
For Christ's sake, I've given you
everything I got on the guy so far.

152
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,322
What more do you want? I don't
want to hear it from you,

153
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,783
I want to hear it from him.

154
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,868
I'll see what I can do.

155
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,997
How are you?

156
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,792
Welcome home, sir.
We'll make this very brief.

157
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,627
How does it feel to
be back, Mr. Zubaidi?

158
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,462
Did you ever think
you'd see this day?

159
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:57,508
I'm an Iraqi citizen, returning
free to the city of my birth.

160
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:02,554
I call on all Iraqis to celebrate
our liberation from tyranny.

161
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,645
Bravo one, we've got two
mechanics taking a look at it.

162
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,814
Tracking on the upgun
is pretty well shot

163
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,857
and the comm links
are all shorted out.

164
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,651
What's the time frame
on a replacement?

165
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:30,958
I want
a squad list, now!

166
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,709
Hey, where's Colonel Bethel?

167
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,919
He's in the back, Chief.

168
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,295
Thank you.

169
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,713
Roy, let me meet you
over here, okay?

170
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,883
Yeah, I'll meet you
in there.

171
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,636
Hey, sir.
Good to see you, Chief.

172
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,096
What's going on
with the intel?

173
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,681
You don't want to get
into that right now.

174
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,600
Well, we gotta talk about it. There's nothing there.
These sites are empty.

175
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,685
We're going to
be very careful,

176
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,812
or there's going to be a
huge shitstorm around here.

177
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:52,855
What do you mean?

178
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,690
They're blaming us
for not moving fast enough.

179
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:55,774
We have to stay on task.

180
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,777
That's bullshit.
The intel's no good.

181
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,362
Let's not make
any waves, okay?

182
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,364
They don't want to hear
that back in Washington.

183
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,701
All they're interested in is finding
something they can hold up on CNN.

184
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,120
Sir, but we gotta talk about this.
The intel is a problem.

185
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,372
Now is not
the time, Chief.

186
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,168
Roo!
On your feet!

187
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,509
Take your seats, people.

188
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,721
We're here this
morning to give the General

189
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,432
a check on where we are
in our search for WMD

190
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,059
and what our plans
are for the next 48 hours.

191
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,980
To that end, I'm turning the floor
over to Captain Jonathan Vaught.

192
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,023
Captain.
Sir.

193
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,817
Welcome, sir.

194
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,571
Today we're going to be briefing you
on WMD operations due to take place

195
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:46,283
in and around the Baghdad area
over the next 24 hours.

196
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,911
We're continuing to target
high-priority sites,

197
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:52,331
since all the folks back home are
anxiously awaiting the information

198
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,249
that we found these weapons.

199
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,752
We have a detailed media plan
we've worked out.

200
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,962
We've coordinated
with the public-affairs folks.

201
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,548
We have a good plan that
involves the top-rated media

202
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,258
in the United States
and the UK

203
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:07,721
so that they're prepared to cover
all aspects of the good news.

204
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,265
Yeah?
I had a couple questions

205
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,309
about the intel
for tomorrow.

206
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,561
Are we sure
this is accurate?

207
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,230
It's solid.
It's good to go.

208
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,857
What's the source?

209
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,568
Well, it's
a human-source intel.

210
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,780
But it's solid.
It's current as of 0400.

211
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,492
Was it the same source
we've been using?

212
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,911
Every site we've hit on the way
up here, we've rolled a donut.

213
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,208
Chief, how about we do this?
Let's talk offline.

214
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,418
Give me a list of the places
where you went, and the grids,

215
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,587
and we'll make sure that you had
the right information written down

216
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,713
and that you went to
the right places, okay?

217
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,425
Captain, the issue isn't the grids, sir.
The issue's that there's nothing there.

218
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,636
Stand down, Chief.
We need to move on here.

219
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:52,099
Don, hold on. Hold a second. Let's
hear what the chief has to say.

220
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,184
Okay, sir,
I'll give you an example.

221
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,937
We rolled into a site,
Diwaniya, last week, okay?

222
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,648
101 st took casualties
securing it for us.

223
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,609
We got in there and found
it was a toilet factory.

224
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,027
I'm saying
there's a disconnect

225
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:08,574
between what's in these packets and
what we're seeing on the ground.

226
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,909
There's a problem
with the intelligence, sir.

227
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,703
Here's the thing, Chief.

228
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,497
These intelligence packages
have all been vetted.

229
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:16,999
They're good.

230
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,669
Your job's to execute them, not worry
about how they're put together.

231
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,046
Are we clear on that?

232
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,214
Yes, sir.

233
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,966
Good. Let's continue.

234
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:32,889
Sir, as I was saying, the intel is
as recent as 0400 this morning.

235
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,850
It's actionable
and it's solid.

236
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,686
All right, next up is
Al Mansour, Baghdad.

237
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,689
It looks like it's some kind
of underground storage site.

238
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,108
You got about 12 klicks of
open highway to the city,

239
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,443
but there's a lot
of activity on that road,

240
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,445
so tell everybody
to keep their heads up.

241
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,571
All right.

242
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:48,739
Chief?

243
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,532
All right. We're going to go chem.
Yeah?

244
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:51,700
I'm gonna get all the
lead teams up, all right?

245
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:52,868
Yeah, yeah.

246
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,536
Martin Brown, CIA.

247
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:55,871
Roy Miller.

248
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,081
Yeah, I know. I saw
you at the meeting.

249
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,542
You're going to the Al
Mansour site in Baghdad.

250
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,544
Yeah.
You're wasting your time.

251
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,546
UN biological team
hit it two months ago.

252
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,672
There's nothing there.

253
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,423
Fuck me.

254
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,136
Here's my card.
You're right.

255
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,888
This thing doesn't add up.

256
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,265
The Iraqis don't fight,
they don't use WMD,

257
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:18,685
they let us walk in here and find
the goddamn cupboard's bare.

258
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,520
There's something
wrong here.

259
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,106
We gotta figure
out what it is.

260
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,067
If you find anything,
you've got my number.

261
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,755
- That's affirmative.
- That's affirmative.

262
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,799
We took on some fire
about four klicks back.

263
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,385
Pretty light, though.
Nothing to worry about.

264
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,109
Oh, I gotta get
some pictures of this.

265
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,110
Be my guest.

266
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,196
Heads up. Incoming.

267
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,324
Fucking Potts,
you red-headed dick.

268
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,379
Hey, Wilkins, this is Chief.
Get up here.

269
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,172
Hold on!

270
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,841
Yo, Kurry, let's go.

271
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,178
Please, get back. Please.

272
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,597
I want you to get a couple of the
guys and clear out this traffic.

273
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,100
We're too exposed out here.
We gotta keep moving.

274
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,394
Back from the truck.
Sir, take it easy.

275
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,895
Please.

276
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,647
Please, step aside.

277
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,149
I need you to move
the vehicle, sir.

278
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,275
Hey, hey, relax.

279
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,859
Easy!

280
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,695
Don't you
fucking touch me!

281
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,782
Motherfucker, let's go.

282
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,284
- Hey!
- Shut the fuck up.

283
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,410
Back the fuck up!

284
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,454
Hey! Hey! Hey,
hey, hey, hey!

285
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:01,663
What's going on, Sergeant?

286
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,998
Chief, they're pissed off.

287
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,500
They say there ain't no water.
All they want is water.

288
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,085
There's nothing
we can do about that.

289
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,504
We just gotta get
our vehicles moving.

290
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,215
I want you to get the men
back in the vehicles now.

291
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,593
- Hey! Hey!
- Get in the fucking car!

292
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,847
Get the fuck back! Get the
fuck back in your vehicle!

293
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:22,433
Back from the truck.
Get back from the truck.

294
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,855
- Don't stop.
- No, sir.

295
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:56,051
Okay, so we're convening an
Iraqi Freedom convention

296
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,886
here inside
the Green Zone tomorrow.

297
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:02,724
We are expecting to have representatives
from all three main ethnic groups,

298
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:06,645
the Kurds, the Shia and the Sunni,
angling for different levels of power.

299
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,397
It is our hope
that Ahmed Zubaidi

300
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,776
will emerge in
a leadership position.

301
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,570
Ben, are you satisfied that
we're in a good place now?

302
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,405
I think we're
in a good place now,

303
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,284
except for, perhaps, the press we're
getting from this looting issue.

304
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,870
Okay, well,
let's table that for now.

305
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,121
In terms of stabilization...

306
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,416
Zubaidi hasn't been
here for 30 years.

307
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,881
Well, he's the best bet we have
right now for a stable democracy.

308
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:38,009
You find me 10 guys in Baghdad
who even know who he is.

309
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,387
Well, he's our friend, Marty.
He's been very helpful.

310
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,055
Our office is
extremely satisfied

311
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,766
with all the information
that we've gotten from him.

312
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,310
Zubaidi's been selling us
a crock of shit for years.

313
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,397
This guy is not reliable. His
intelligence is not reliable.

314
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,148
His report chain
is not reliable.

315
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,902
This is exactly why people are losing
confidence in the Agency, Marty.

316
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,822
You're questioning every single piece
of intelligence that's coming in,

317
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,782
up to the point where
we can't make any progress.

318
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,702
You cannot just hand this country over
to an exile no one's ever heard of

319
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,620
and a bunch of interns
from Washington.

320
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,664
Well, you're
a Middle East expert, Marty.

321
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:10,834
If you got a better idea, why don't you
just throw it out here on the table?

322
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,420
We need to use the
Iraqi army to help us.

323
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,590
This country is a powder
keg of ethnic division.

324
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,259
Now Saddam is gone, they're the only
ones who can hold this place together.

325
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,760
We're not selling that
to the American people.

326
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,512
We beat the Iraqi army.
Right.

327
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,097
Well, they're still out
there and they're armed,

328
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,640
and they're looking for a
place in the new Iraq.

329
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,142
They're going to be
waiting a long time.

330
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,977
They didn't all
follow Saddam.

331
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,770
There are officers
we can work with out there,

332
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:31,897
if we make it
worth their while.

333
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,356
Hey, let me tell
you something.

334
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,191
We've spent too
much American treasure

335
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,776
and too many American lives

336
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,154
for us to put a Ba'athist general
into a position of power.

337
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:43,158
Have you any idea what's going
on outside the Green Zone?

338
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,328
It's chaos. No police,
revenge killings every night.

339
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,538
People are asking
why we can't stop this.

340
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,332
We are losing the population.
Democracy is messy.

341
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,000
Democracy is messy.

342
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:55,211
If you dismantle this country
and cut out the army,

343
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,380
you'll have civil war
in six months.

344
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,673
I guarantee it.

345
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,591
Okay, let's move on.

346
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:04,466
We are continuing to hold at the
intersection at Alpha-Charlie-three.

347
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:05,592
Calm down!

348
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:06,801
Listen to me, please!

349
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,678
- Just listen.
- Sergeant Wilkins!

350
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,849
- Get on the ground!
- My arm!

351
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,934
Hey, what's going on
over there, Wilkins?

352
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,645
- Chief, there's a local here.
- He's out of control.

353
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,855
Perry had to tackle him.

354
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,898
I'm on my way.

355
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:25,111
All right, back up.

356
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,197
You stay
the fuck down.

357
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:28,698
- What's going on?
- You are hurting me!

358
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:29,908
What's going on
here, Sergeant?

359
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,160
This Hajji says he needs to
talk to you about something.

360
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,995
I have no idea.
He goes on and on and on.

361
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,080
Stay down.

362
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,748
- Why are you doing this?
- Why you do it?

363
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:37,957
You agree someone
do this to you?

364
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,167
Hey, Perry. Perry.

365
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:40,335
You let him up.
Let him up.

366
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,461
You agree?

367
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:44,297
Up? I can stand up now?

368
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:47,717
Why you are doing this, huh?
Why you are doing this?

369
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,552
You agree someone put your
head in the dust like this?

370
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,097
You agree to be treated like this?
This is not fair!

371
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,973
Hey, calm down.

372
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:57,102
I'm trying to calm down, but this
guy, he put me on the floor!

373
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,270
Are you finished?

374
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,023
Yeah, I'm finished.

375
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,108
What's your name?

376
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:07,028
My name is Farid Youssef Abdul Rahman.
You call me Freddy, okay?

377
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:10,198
I have information. I was driving
like five minutes from here.

378
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:14,661
I saw some people, you know, like
Saddam's men, like Ba'athist people.

379
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:17,247
They are meeting. They have
a meeting near to here.

380
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:19,124
I saw you are... I don't
know, you're digging here,

381
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,167
and I come to tell you. Okay, just calm down.
Hey! Hey! Hey!

382
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,211
Calm down. Calm down.

383
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,213
Why should I believe
you, Freddy?

384
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,882
You think it's easy to come
and talk to American?

385
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,844
You think it's easy? I come here, all
these people, they're looking at me?

386
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:33,096
You stick me on the floor. I want
to speak to you quietly, huh.

387
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,264
And you are
digging in the ground.

388
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:35,849
Why you are digging
in the ground?

389
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,726
You need to talk to these people.
You know what they are saying?

390
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,855
You think someone can put
something in this place

391
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:44,774
with all these people watching
and all these people don't know?

392
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,942
It's not logical.

393
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:51,072
I am here to help you,
okay, Miller?

394
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,536
Come with me, Freddy.
Come with me.

395
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:57,620
Chief, you good?

396
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,580
Yeah, I'm fine.

397
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,082
Sir, come
this way, please.

398
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:04,377
Hey, Chief! Chief,
what are we doing?

399
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:08,089
Hey, I'm gonna need his car keys.
Freddy, give him your car keys.

400
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,215
My keys?

401
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,301
Chief, you don't believe
this guy, do you?

402
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,428
Look, I wanna go
real low-vis on this.

403
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:16,890
I want to take Freddy's car and
I want to get maybe one other.

404
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:20,852
If we roll over there in those Humvees,
they're going to see us coming.

405
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,605
I want to take Keating,
Potts, Bronner on comms.

406
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:26,274
You gotta get me Michaels with the
SAW and bring Perry over here.

407
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:27,400
What's up, Chief?

408
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:28,526
Hey, you guys
ready to go to work?

409
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,652
Hell, yeah, Chief.

410
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,571
Chief, let me talk
to you, please.

411
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:32,655
What?

412
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,865
Chief, our mission is here.

413
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:38,119
What, you wanna sit around
and dig holes all day?

414
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,579
I want to get
something done.

415
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,210
All right,
here's the situation.

416
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,128
This Iraqi just showed
up with information

417
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,796
that about two
or three "K" west of here,

418
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,465
there's a meeting
taking place right now,

419
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,467
possible high-value
targets involved.

420
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,968
So I want to move on it.

421
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:57,472
In the first car, I want to
take the Iraqi guy, Freddy.

422
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,474
Keating, you're going
to drive, I'll ride shotgun.

423
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,809
Potts, you're in the back
covering Freddy the entire time.

424
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,354
The rest of you guys are going to roll
in the pick-up truck. Any questions?

425
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:08,942
Hey, Chief, how do we know this guy
isn't leading us into a fucking ambush?

426
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,818
We don't.

427
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,321
Get your fucking game face on.

428
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,783
Roger.

429
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,785
- Hooah.
- Hooah!

430
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,787
All right, let's roll. You're
not letting me drive, huh?

431
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,080
No, you're not driving.

432
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,039
Weapons ready.

433
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,669
It's Freddy, right? I'm Potts.
Nice to meet you.

434
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,628
Fire it up!

435
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,618
Okay, Sergeant Perry, I want
you to carry on straight.

436
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,454
Take your next left, take your
next left and go around the back.

437
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,622
Roger that, Chief.

438
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:33,211
And if you stop here, it is
the house on that corner.

439
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,171
Okay, pull up here.
Pull up here.

440
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,717
Okay, be advised, it is the
house on the southeast corner.

441
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,761
The big white house
with the wall.

442
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:45,431
Heads up.
Someone's coming out.

443
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,726
There were six or
seven men with guns.

444
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,650
All right, we got a guy with a
briefcase and another with an AK-47.

445
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:58,986
Perry, where are you?
You in position?

446
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,490
In position,
Chief. We got them.

447
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,659
Black BMW with three men.

448
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,868
I want to take the BMW.

449
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,745
As soon as he comes up our way,
we're going to cut him off.

450
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,707
I want to take the BMW and then the house.
Go, go, go.

451
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:20,299
Go, go, go!

452
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,343
Out of the fucking car! Get
the fuck out of the car, now!

453
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,762
Perry, get on that door.

454
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,514
Get on that door.

455
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,057
Zip him up.
Bronner, stay with him.

456
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,517
Everybody else,
go, go, go, go, go!

457
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,226
On me. Stack on me.

458
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,377
Let's go!
Let's go! Go, go, go!

459
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,213
On the fucking ground, now!

460
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,924
All right, down,
down, down.

461
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,429
Clear! This side clear!

462
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,682
I've got no exit. Where's the back door?
Michaels, with me!

463
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,725
Keating, on the stairs up!

464
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:17,773
Stairs down. Michaels,
come with me down! Down!

465
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,900
With you, Chief.

466
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,999
Taking fire!

467
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,714
Look out!

468
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,513
Get ready
to hook right.

469
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:49,680
Hook right!

470
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,849
I got stairs up.

471
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,189
Clear. It's clear.

472
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,733
This is Chief.
Give me a sit rep.

473
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,277
This is Potts,
got one wrapped up.

474
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,905
Keating, all clear out front.

475
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:09,783
Chief, this is Perry.
I need you up here right away.

476
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,703
Coming in!

477
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,169
It's okay. Your husband is okay.
Perry!

478
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,963
Look, Chief,
you gotta do something.

479
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:24,798
They don't understand
what the fuck I'm saying.

480
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,885
This is the mother, that's the mother.
Enough! Enough.

481
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:32,014
Tell her to calm down.
Say, "Calm down."

482
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,270
I don't understand her, Chief
It's a different dialect.

483
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:39,897
Don't let her leave. Don't let
any of them leave this room.

484
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,566
There's a body down there.
Don't let them leave.

485
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,776
You got it, Chief.

486
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,404
Ma'am, you can't
go downstairs.

487
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,657
You cannot go
downstairs. Stay down.

488
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,201
Shut up! Shut up!

489
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:53,452
Watch yourself, Potts.

490
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:57,623
Get Freddy in here. Stand him up.
I gotta talk to him.

491
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,250
Freddy, come here.

492
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,793
I don't want this.
Hey, I need you to...

493
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:03,337
I come to you for information.
I don't want this.

494
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,881
Listen, I need you
to ask him questions for me.

495
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,675
Tell him you're
my translator.

496
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,930
Ask him...
Hey, what is this shit?

497
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,515
What is this?
Is this on him?

498
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,351
Yeah, that was fucking
in his back pockets.

499
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,894
He says
he doesn't do anything.

500
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,230
Ask him his name.

501
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:25,026
His name's Seyyed Hamza.

502
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:27,986
Seyyed Hamza.
Is this his house?

503
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,865
Is this your house?

504
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:35,202
Hey, listen, tell him he's
gonna answer my questions

505
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,871
or things are going to go
very bad for him.

506
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:43,418
Ask him what the
meeting was about.

507
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:45,546
Chief, I just got
off the phone.

508
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,966
That license plate belongs
to General Mohammed Al Rawi.

509
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,343
The Jack of Clubs.

510
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:52,386
Shut the fuck up!

511
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,472
Hey, Michaels, do you
have that deck of cards?

512
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,556
Yes.

513
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,391
Give me
the Jack of Clubs.

514
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,894
Is that the guy? Was that the
guy that went out the back?

515
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,103
Here it is, Chief.

516
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,938
Let me see. Let me see.

517
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,815
Is that the guy? That's the guy.
I just saw this guy.

518
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,192
Bullshit!
That's the fucking guy.

519
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:07,735
I just saw him downstairs.

520
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:11,238
This man. This is
Saddam's top general.

521
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,075
Al Rawi? You know
who this is? Al Rawi?

522
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:15,534
He say he don't know.

523
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,619
Al Rawi's in this house?

524
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,829
This is the guy I saw.

525
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:26,587
Okay, okay. Time's up. Okay, get
everybody ready. We're leaving.

526
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:30,799
All right, he's got to know about WMD.
He's coming with me.

527
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,606
Hey, Freddy, I want
you to come with me.

528
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,274
Hey, Michaels!
What's up, Chief?

529
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,526
Bring them all
over to the wall.

530
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,986
Potts, I want you to get the guy.
Get the guy and bring him to me.

531
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,155
Roger that, Chief.

532
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,534
Just sit him down against the wall.
Yes, sir.

533
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:59,078
Sit those guys
over there.

534
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:02,456
Come over here, Freddy. Come here.
I need you to translate.

535
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:06,251
Tell him I want to know about
weapons of mass destruction.

536
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:10,339
Does he know where
the weapons are?

537
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:15,219
What? What? What do you
know about weapons?

538
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,721
Where are the weapons?

539
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:26,522
He say only General Mohammed Al
Rawi, he know about these things.

540
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:30,150
The special program
is under his hand personally.

541
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:34,405
He's the only one who know the
truth about these things.

542
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,824
Okay, how do
I find Al Rawi?

543
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:39,326
How do I find Al Rawi?

544
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,831
He said, can you
protect his family?

545
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:52,506
"If you protect my family, I will
tell you how you find Mohammed."

546
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,885
"And then from him
you will know the truth."

547
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:58,345
Okay, he's got a deal.

548
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:02,224
Ask him about the book.

549
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:06,270
What is it? Is it codes?
Is it diagrams? Maps?

550
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,954
What the fuck?

551
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:43,224
All right, Scotty,
head on down there.

552
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:45,184
Shorty, bag them and parade them.
Yes, sir.

553
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,602
Hey, you Miller?
Yeah.

554
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,103
Where are the other two?

555
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,480
Two what?

556
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,689
We're missing two pucks.

557
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,316
Anybody got eyes on the other two pucks?
No, no, no!

558
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:55,444
These are my guys. Hold on. Hold on.
These are my prisoners.

559
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,737
My prisoner now.

560
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,573
Hey! That's my translator!
That's my translator!

561
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,075
What the fuck is going on?

562
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,910
I got a colonel
waiting on these guys.

563
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,162
I got orders to get
these guys back there.

564
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,372
They're en route right now.

565
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:07,540
Hey, white bread,
calm down.

566
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:09,250
This goes way up higher
than your people, all right?

567
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:10,376
Please, stand right there.

568
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:11,961
Come on.
That prisoner's ours.

569
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:13,838
Well, he's mine now. Let's go.

570
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,797
Take care
of my family!

571
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,633
What they are doing?

572
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,760
I did nothing!

573
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:25,766
The book!
He's got my book!

574
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,769
Chief,
what the fuck's going on?

575
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,355
Fuck!

576
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,108
Yeah, I got him. He says some
guy took a book off him.

577
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:36,943
Book? All right, all right.
Notebook.

578
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,195
He says something
about a book.

579
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,280
His what?

580
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:41,407
You got his book. He says
you got his fucking book.

581
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:43,450
Do you have the guy's notebook?
Don't fuck around.

582
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,286
I don't know what
you're talking about.

583
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:48,789
Get your fucking
hands off me, asshole.

584
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,754
Just give me the
fucking book, Miller.

585
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:01,927
All right.

586
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,312
I fucking
asked you nicely!

587
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,817
Fuck you! I don't
have a fucking book!

588
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,988
Have a nice war.

589
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,908
All right,
let's get out of here!

590
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:27,994
Get off me!

591
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,929
Hey!

592
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:48,974
Where's Freddy?

593
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,893
You mean the guy with the limp?
Yeah.

594
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:53,103
He went over
by the alleyway.

595
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,355
Fuck! I thought you
were watching him.

596
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:56,315
Where's my weapon? Where's my weapon?
Right here!

597
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:58,359
I gave him the book.
I gave him the fucking book!

598
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,861
Potts, Michaels, go with him now!
Go! Let's go! Let's go!

599
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,529
Bronner, hey! Come on!

600
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,364
Moving!

601
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,951
Go! Go!

602
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,376
Go around!
Seal it! Seal it!

603
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:17,627
You got it, Chief!

604
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,590
Get him, Potts.

605
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:25,218
Go left!
Go, seal it, seal it.

606
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,722
I got him! Stop!

607
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,391
Stop!

608
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,733
Get him!
Get him! Get him!

609
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:47,408
What the fuck! What the fuck! What the fuck!
Why are you running?

610
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:48,492
Why you are chasing me?

611
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,452
Give me the book.

612
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,537
Give me the fucking book!

613
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:53,330
Here the book.
Here the book.

614
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:57,584
Why are you... What you are doing? I
was going to bring the book back.

615
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:01,088
The man is putting Iraqis in the helicopter.
He hit you in the face.

616
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,965
What you want me to do?

617
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:05,801
What I have to do
for you to believe me?

618
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:07,386
Get everyone
back to the trucks.

619
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:08,679
Roger.

620
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,265
Hey, let's go.
Let's go.

621
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:14,476
What more I have to do
for you? Huh?

622
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:18,939
I come to you with information. You
take the information, it's right.

623
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,525
You want the book. I have the book.
I give you the book.

624
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:24,278
You think I can
leave my car?

625
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,780
You know what this car,
it means to me?

626
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,199
Even you have the key!

627
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,296
What happened to your leg?

628
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,508
My leg is in Iran.

629
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,760
Since 1987.

630
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:51,805
Me, too, I fight
for my country.

631
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,600
Freddy, listen. You give
me your information.

632
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,727
I'm going to get you a reward
for what you did today.

633
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,478
Reward?

634
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:02,191
You think I do
this for money?

635
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:05,861
You think I don't care about my country?
I see what's happening.

636
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:08,655
You don't think I see
what's happen in it?

637
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,532
And all the people now,
even they have no water,

638
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,658
they have no electricity.

639
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,535
You think I do this
for reward?

640
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,038
You don't think
I do this for me?

641
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:19,666
For my future? For my country?
For all these things?

642
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:23,212
Whatever you want here,
I want more than you want.

643
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,839
I want to help my country.

644
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,815
Who is this?

645
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:44,441
Hey, this is Chief Miller.

646
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,693
I have something I think
you'd be interested in.

647
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:50,405
Listen, I don't have time to play games.
Just tell me what you've got.

648
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:54,534
Well, this morning I came face
to face with Mohammed Al Rawi.

649
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,537
General Al Rawi?

650
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:57,871
Yeah, the Jack of Clubs.

651
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,539
Come in
and talk to me.

652
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,209
I'm in the Green Zone, Republican Palace.
By the pool.

653
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,253
I'm on my way. Listen, make
sure Johnson runs checks...

654
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:07,256
Hey, Sergeant Wilkins,
I gotta talk to you.

655
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:09,925
We gotta go get our prisoner
back, find this guy, Al Rawi.

656
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,218
Let Bethel handle it, please.

657
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,554
No. Bethel can't see past
the files on his desk.

658
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:14,888
So, what, you're going to ring
the doorbell now

659
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,557
and ask Special Forces
to hand him over? No.

660
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:18,350
I'm going to use the book and
trade up and get some help.

661
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:19,434
What are you
talking about?

662
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,479
Jerry, why the fuck do we keep
coming up empty on all these sites?

663
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,897
There has gotta
be a reason.

664
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,899
Chief, we're here to do a
job and get home safe.

665
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,734
That's all.
The reasons don't matter.

666
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,070
They matter to me.

667
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:35,867
With all due respect, Chief,
I can't go with you on this.

668
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,704
Understood. I'm going
to split the team.

669
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:40,330
I'm going to take my crew
plus Sergeant Perry.

670
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,125
You report back to Bethel
with everyone else, hooah?

671
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:44,751
Hooah.

672
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,881
Hey, Freddy.
You want a job?

673
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,551
Yes.

674
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,344
Good. Get in your car,
follow us.

675
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,429
Where to, Chief?

676
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,430
Republican Palace.

677
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:12,446
This is not
a good time, Lawrie.

678
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,780
I've waited
long enough.

679
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,116
I told you,
I'm doing the best I can.

680
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:18,577
This is not what
I signed up for, Clark.

681
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:21,038
I put my reputation on the
line with these stories.

682
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,040
I am not going to let
you hang me out to dry.

683
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,291
Well, there's huge
things at stake here.

684
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:27,252
I'm not going to let them be compromised
because you need to sell some newspapers.

685
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:31,047
You knew the deal. I give you
Magellan, you give me anonymity.

686
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:34,968
Listen, Clark, I'm done
waiting, so is the paper.

687
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:39,931
You won't help me find Magellan,
I'm going to find someone who can.

688
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,953
Right here.

689
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,533
Can you get me
some more beers? Frisbee!

690
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:41,367
Oh, shit!

691
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,419
Oh, my goodness.
We got enough time for that?

692
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:54,047
These guys got Domino's
Pizza and fucking beer?

693
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:55,882
Get in the pool, man.

694
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,551
Sergeant Perry, I've gotta
go talk to this guy,

695
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,219
so you all are on your own
for a little while.

696
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,595
Roger that.

697
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:01,722
Can we have beer?

698
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:03,473
Not one.

699
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,069
So, what happened?

700
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,904
We were digging at a site.

701
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:21,366
Local come up to us and give us a tip
that there was a meeting going on

702
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,452
with some high-value
targets nearby.

703
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:26,663
We hit the house, and it turned out
the guy was right. Al Rawi was there.

704
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,707
You sure it was him?
Positive.

705
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:31,418
He had a security detail with him,
and we exchanged fire with them

706
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:34,754
and he slipped out
during the firefight.

707
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:43,096
Now that's the book that I took
off this guy, Seyyed Hamza.

708
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,514
He was the host
of the meeting.

709
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,767
And I was in the process of
figuring out what the fuck it was

710
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:49,769
when SF showed up
and snatched him.

711
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:51,980
God damn!

712
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,774
Okay, but where
did they take him?

713
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:55,984
Because if you can get me
access to this guy,

714
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:58,152
I'll get Al Rawi.

715
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:04,284
Look, we're both
after the WMD, right?

716
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,662
It's a little more
complicated than that.

717
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,914
Well, not to me, it isn't.

718
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,753
All right, I'll make a
call, get you reassigned.

719
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:17,381
There are some empty buildings on
the other side of the compound.

720
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:19,800
Get out of uniform and report
to my office in an hour.

721
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:21,801
Outstanding.

722
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:36,357
How'd you get
the bloody nose?

723
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,485
Oh, that's a long story.

724
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:43,281
You're in the 85th.
That's WMD unit, right?

725
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:44,825
How did you know that?

726
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:46,660
It's right there
on your rifle.

727
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:50,747
Lawrie Dayne, Wall Street Journal.
How's it going?

728
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:55,377
You know, we haven't found shit yet.
Hey, Sergeant Perry.

729
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:57,462
We'll find it.
It's frustrating, right?

730
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,672
Little bit.

731
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:02,008
So what are you
and Marty talking about?

732
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:03,927
Oh, you know I can't
talk to you about that.

733
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,512
Oh, come on.

734
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:08,723
You come in fresh off the field to
have a lemonade with Martin Brown?

735
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:11,559
Something's gotta be going on.

736
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,895
Well, you could ask him.

737
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,272
I'm asking you.

738
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:19,192
Does it make sense to you that
we're still coming up empty?

739
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,863
No. No, it doesn't.

740
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:27,367
Someone told us
they were there, right?

741
00:46:30,163 --> 00:46:32,705
If you come
across anything,

742
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,959
call me.

743
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:40,463
I'll keep it in mind.

744
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:12,513
- Where's he hiding?
- Where's Al Rawi?

745
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,058
Where's Al Rawi?

746
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,601
How long have
they been going?

747
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:17,936
For about 10 minutes.

748
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:20,522
You want to see your wife and kids again?
You have five kids.

749
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:22,190
You want them
to see their father?

750
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:26,569
He says, "Please, do not involve
my family in this situation."

751
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:28,780
"I swear to God..."

752
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:31,449
You're involved,
so your family's involved.

753
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,327
All I want is an answer,
where to look for this man,

754
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,746
and you can walk out of here.

755
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,498
- Where's Al Rawi?
- Where's Al Rawi?

756
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:41,793
And I want
a name or an address.

757
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:45,129
Somewhere I can find
General Al Rawi.

758
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,840
I am going
to get an answer,

759
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:49,968
and you know you're going
to tell me something.

760
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:54,889
All right, I'm going to let go and
you're going to give me an address.

761
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,685
Where's Al Rawi?
Where is he?

762
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:00,186
The book! The book!

763
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,938
He says you need the book.

764
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,399
The fucking book again?
What's in the book?

765
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,776
"The book,
that's how you'll find him."

766
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:10,863
It has the names and locations
of Al Rawi's safe houses.

767
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,464
Chief Miller around?

768
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:30,716
Yeah. Up the stairs,
down on the right.

769
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:44,564
Hey, Chief, Clark Poundstone,
Pentagon Special Intelligence Unit.

770
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:46,858
A great job bagging Hamza.

771
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,568
Thanks. Appreciate it.

772
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:50,570
Walk you out?

773
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,072
Sure.

774
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:54,032
You're with our MET Team, right?
Yeah.

775
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:57,077
Well, the administration really
appreciates the work you guys are doing.

776
00:49:57,078 --> 00:49:59,245
We gotta get this WMD
issue behind us

777
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:02,207
so we can get on with the
challenges of the future.

778
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:03,958
That's where this Hamza
guy could be helpful.

779
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,835
He's confirmed
a few facts for us.

780
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:09,214
Says your guys might have
lifted a notebook from him.

781
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:11,925
Well, everything I got off
him I gave to Martin Brown.

782
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:13,635
Why don't you ask him
if he's got it?

783
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:15,220
I don't think Marty
would go for that.

784
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:17,681
He's a hell of a guy, but he's been
in the Middle East a long time.

785
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:20,225
He's got a lot of
preconceived ideas.

786
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,894
Our unit's trying to get
back to the raw intel.

787
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:24,771
Look, I don't want
to throw Marty under a bus,

788
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:26,606
but he doesn't like
what we're coming up with.

789
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:27,774
The guy's a dinosaur,

790
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:31,319
and we need to get some new
thinking going on around here.

791
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,280
There's an opportunity
for you here, Miller.

792
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,782
I know Marty's pulled
you in temporarily,

793
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:40,244
but if you're looking for something
more permanent, I can help.

794
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,999
We're doing a good thing here.
We're going to rebuild this place.

795
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,460
People are watching us.

796
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:51,506
I'll keep it in mind.

797
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:53,341
You do that.

798
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:57,345
If you hear anything about
that notebook, let me know.

799
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:04,269
Your friend from the Pentagon Special
Intelligence Unit came to see me.

800
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,311
Poundstone?

801
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,646
Yeah, Poundstone.

802
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:10,275
Poundstone's unit pushed all that WMD
intel you've been chasing your tail on.

803
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:11,985
What? You mean Magellan?

804
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:13,778
Who is Magellan?
Have you ever met him?

805
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:14,946
No.

806
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:16,781
Poundstone's got him
locked up tight.

807
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,909
That's why we gotta find
out what's going on.

808
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,119
Here's the deal.

809
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,328
We checked the notebook.

810
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,998
It's a list of addresses around
Baghdad, mostly Adhamiya.

811
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:28,042
It's a Sunni stronghold,
very sympathetic to the army.

812
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,170
More than likely,
that's where Al Rawi is.

813
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:32,672
The notebook's probably his line
to his battalion commanders.

814
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:33,757
We all set?

815
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:35,633
Not yet. We're waiting
on military support.

816
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:39,137
Push them hard. I want to get
every address in that book.

817
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:40,764
So, what do you think
that meeting was about?

818
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:43,308
What would you be talking about
if you just got invaded?

819
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:45,560
You think Al Rawi
wants to fight?

820
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:47,896
If we don't make him
an offer, he will.

821
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:49,981
What? You're going
to cut a deal?

822
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:53,651
You're going to cut a deal
with the Jack of Clubs?

823
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,529
What do you think
you're doing here, Miller?

824
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,531
You're off reservation
for a reason. What is it?

825
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:01,576
Well, I came to find
weapons and save lives.

826
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:03,453
And I didn't find shit.

827
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,163
I want to know why.

828
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:08,208
There are no easy answers. If you
want that, go work with Poundstone.

829
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:10,251
All we got is hard choices.

830
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,253
You want to know what
happened to the weapons?

831
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:14,255
We gotta find Al Rawi
and bring him in.

832
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,007
He'll give us
the truth about WMD

833
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:20,636
and give us a shot at standing this
country up without a bloodbath.

834
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:23,514
Do you want the job or not?

835
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:28,519
Yeah, I want it.
Good.

836
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:32,273
Hamza's being held at the high-value
target wing at Camp Cropper.

837
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,275
Poundstone's unit
have him under wraps.

838
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:36,778
So, how are you going
to get to him?

839
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:38,988
I'm not. You are.

840
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,615
Here's a pass.

841
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:44,494
We've got another prisoner there
we can use to get you in.

842
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:47,622
Low-level Republican Guard,
way below their radar.

843
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:50,583
Use him as an excuse
to get to Hamza.

844
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,502
Here's a million
dollars in cash.

845
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:55,296
Tell Hamza the money's his
if he gives us what we need.

846
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:58,216
You tell him if
he gives Al Rawi to me,

847
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:00,885
keeps his mouth shut over
there until I bring him in,

848
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:04,722
I'll have him and his family out of
the country by the end of the week.

849
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,767
You want me to tell him to not talk
to the American interrogators?

850
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,810
That's right.

851
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:14,607
I thought we were
all on the same side.

852
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,734
Don't be naive.

853
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:42,468
Miller.

854
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:44,512
Pentagon just
revoked your transfer.

855
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:48,974
You're being released back to
your unit, effective immediately.

856
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,311
You chose the wrong side.

857
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:01,987
Follow me, Freddy.
We gotta move fast.

858
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:04,073
Where do you think you're going?

859
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,618
Let us through.
Step aside, please.

860
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:13,333
What the hell are you playing at?
Get me Langley.

861
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:15,335
You are required
to hand over all information.

862
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:18,838
White House authorization.
I want the book.

863
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:32,143
DC's got too much riding on this to have you
and some Ba'athist generals fuck it up.

864
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:34,187
Martin.

865
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,439
Langley confirms.

866
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,733
I've got it!

867
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:46,740
Let's go.
Stay out of this, Marty.

868
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:50,453
- You all right here?
- Yeah.

869
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:02,715
Use local assets.

870
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,426
It's high priority.

871
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,265
Stay close
to me, Freddy.

872
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:57,019
Put him down.

873
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:01,607
OGA.

874
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:04,276
I'm here to see
a prisoner.

875
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,284
Heads up, Sarge.
Hey, Sergeant.

876
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:12,952
Hello, sir.

877
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:17,623
I'm here to see
Abdullah Ferat.

878
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:19,709
I'm gonna have
to search your bag.

879
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,085
What's up with Hajji?

880
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,337
He's my translator.

881
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:28,551
Arms up,
legs apart.

882
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:41,689
Check it out.

883
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,566
What's that
in your pocket?

884
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,818
It's my cigarettes.

885
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:48,738
Good to go.
Here you go, sir.

886
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:51,824
Go ahead and take
them back to IR-1.

887
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,008
Right here.

888
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:31,948
That's not
necessary, Sergeant.

889
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:34,366
Standard procedure, sir.

890
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:43,376
Sergeant, I have to have a classified
conversation with the prisoner.

891
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:44,627
You can go on
and step outside.

892
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:47,546
Roger, sir.
Be right outside.

893
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:13,781
Do you know why
they brought him here?

894
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:19,704
He's here because he's in
the Republican Guard, Freddy.

895
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:21,747
Hey, Sergeant.

896
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,750
Hey, listen, this guy just
gave us a piece of intel.

897
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:28,421
You apparently have a prisoner in your
HVT wing here named Seyyed Hamza.

898
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:29,589
He can ID him for me.

899
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,757
I gotta get him down here
and ID him real quick.

900
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,427
You're going to need
an EJ-75 for that, man.

901
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:35,553
Guys, I got a live op going.

902
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:38,055
I got a team in place ready to move on a target.
I gotta do this now.

903
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,098
How long will it take?

904
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:40,224
Two minutes.

905
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,351
Just two minutes? That's it.
Two minutes. Come on.

906
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,812
All right. Good, let's go.
Hey, Freddy.

907
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,776
Put those bags
on their heads.

908
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:03,539
OGA coming in
for an ID check.

909
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,514
Hey, Hamza.

910
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,266
Get up.

911
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,770
Shit.

912
00:59:28,649 --> 00:59:30,649
Get a medic!

913
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:35,362
I said, get a medic!

914
00:59:35,364 --> 00:59:39,658
Hey, get the medics on the phone.
We've got a situation here.

915
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,829
He say, "Why did you
do this to me?"

916
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:50,461
He say the general did everything
you ask of him in the meeting.

917
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:53,422
What do you...
What meeting?

918
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,049
What meeting?

919
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:04,600
He just say Jordan.

920
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,685
Clear the way!
Clear the way!

921
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:06,769
What is going
on here, Miller?

922
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,271
Coming through! Okay.

923
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,775
What does
he mean, "Jordan"?

924
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:21,366
We gotta stop the
bleeding. His pulse is weak.

925
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,670
I need to talk to you
about Magellan.

926
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,841
I'm going to call you
right back.

927
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:45,344
What you got?

928
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:48,681
I read your articles.

929
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:51,725
You said an Iraqi WMD
source named Magellan

930
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:54,395
met with US officials
prior to the war.

931
01:02:54,396 --> 01:02:56,188
I need to know
about that meeting.

932
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:59,525
Oh, no. Come on, Miller. I can't
discuss my sources with you.

933
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:03,529
Well, did you ever meet the guy?
Do you know who he is?

934
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:07,199
Of course I didn't meet him. He's an
Iraqi internal, for Christ's sake.

935
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,744
Then how do you know
what he's saying is true?

936
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:15,374
Because I made contact through
a reliable intermediary.

937
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,417
Reliable?
Yes.

938
01:03:18,879 --> 01:03:22,631
Have you ever even been to
any of Magellan's sites?

939
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:25,676
You ever been
to Diwaniya? Tikrit?

940
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:28,929
No.

941
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,555
There's nothing there.

942
01:03:31,183 --> 01:03:34,101
Magellan's intel
is bullshit.

943
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:38,731
Who's the intermediary?

944
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,733
No. I'm not discussing
sources, Miller.

945
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:44,277
Jesus Christ! This is the
reason we went to war!

946
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:53,204
All right, then at least
tell me how it happened.

947
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:54,330
How does this happen?

948
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:57,708
How does somebody like you write
something that's not true?

949
01:03:57,709 --> 01:03:59,501
Tell me!

950
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,296
What do you know?

951
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:15,434
Look, I got a phone call one day
from a senior official in DC.

952
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:18,103
He says,
"I've got a story for you."

953
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:21,106
"The truth about
Saddam's WMD programs."

954
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,442
So I go to meet him.

955
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:26,987
He puts the source
report in my hands.

956
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:30,115
Magellan's product,
the raw intel.

957
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:33,452
But when do you
check the story?

958
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:38,207
He was a senior official,
for Christ's sake.

959
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,876
He had access
to Magellan's debrief.

960
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:45,505
All he asked was that I not disclose
the location of the meeting.

961
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:47,424
The location.

962
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:50,302
Yes, in case I'd
compromise the source.

963
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:54,139
It was Jordan, wasn't it?

964
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:57,601
The meeting was in Jordan.

965
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:03,315
Yes.

966
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:19,206
You can keep
your million dollars.

967
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:21,541
Al Rawi's Magellan.

968
01:05:22,294 --> 01:05:26,297
They're debriefing Magellan.
They've got him held tight.

969
01:05:26,298 --> 01:05:28,673
Supposing they don't?

970
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:34,179
John, take care
of the money.

971
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:37,391
Hamza said Al Rawi met
US officials in Jordan.

972
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:39,435
Now Dayne said the same
thing about Magellan.

973
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:41,270
That's more
than a coincidence.

974
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:44,439
Maybe. It doesn't
make any sense.

975
01:05:44,566 --> 01:05:46,817
If Poundstone met Al Rawi in
Jordan, what's he hiding?

976
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:50,487
Well, what if he told him
something he didn't wanna hear?

977
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:53,657
What if he told him
there were no WMD?

978
01:05:57,704 --> 01:05:59,788
I want Al Rawi's
movements outside Iraq.

979
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:02,124
January, February, 2003.
Anything you got.

980
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:04,042
I'm on it.

981
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:07,171
It all makes sense.
The bad intel.

982
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:09,590
Why our teams came up
empty at those sites.

983
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:12,885
Maybe we're looking at this
thing the wrong way around.

984
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:14,970
It's a theory.

985
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:17,056
You've got no proof.

986
01:06:17,057 --> 01:06:18,932
Don't be naive.

987
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:26,106
Sir, Mohammed Al Rawi was in Amman,
Jordan on February 5th, 2003.

988
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:31,153
That's three days before
Magellan came online.

989
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:35,574
Give me Clark Poundstone's
movements, same period.

990
01:06:39,788 --> 01:06:42,539
Sir, we've got a DOD
Gulf stream on the same date.

991
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:46,377
Passenger Clark Poundstone routed
Washington, DC to Amman, Jordan.

992
01:06:46,378 --> 01:06:50,464
Martin, we're getting reports of an
attack on an Al Rawi safe house.

993
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:52,383
South Adhamiya.

994
01:06:52,384 --> 01:06:55,678
Poundstone's hunting Al Rawi. He
doesn't want the truth to get out.

995
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:58,597
I need to know where the
next safe house is.

996
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,176
All clear, Chief.

997
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:20,679
Send Freddy!

998
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:24,182
Yes, sir!
Freddy, on the move.

999
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:30,981
Freddy, I need you
to translate.

1000
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:33,942
Tell him I need to get a
message to General Al Rawi.

1001
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:38,280
Tell him I need
to meet Al Rawi tonight.

1002
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:46,621
Chief Miller on the
phone for you, sir.

1003
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,957
- Yeah?
- I got him.

1004
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:52,711
Tahir al-Malik, one of Al
Rawi's battalion commanders.

1005
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:54,713
Where is he?
I let him go.

1006
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:57,299
Look, I told him to get
a message to Al Rawi.

1007
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:01,094
I told him I'd meet him at the
Adhamiya bus station tonight.

1008
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:03,680
If I can bring him in alive,
then we'll have our proof.

1009
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:07,309
If he talks, then we'll
get the truth about WMD.

1010
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:10,854
All right, if you get in front of Al
Rawi, offer him whatever you have to.

1011
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:11,939
If you pull this off,

1012
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:14,066
there's still a chance we can
hold this place together.

1013
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:16,401
I'm headed there now.

1014
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:19,822
You are serious to do a
deal with Mohammed Al Rawi?

1015
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:23,241
You know what already
he do to this country?

1016
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:27,162
We're just trying
to save lives, Freddy.

1017
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:31,082
There are people who think
he can stop an insurgency.

1018
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:33,293
All right, listen up,
we're going to Adhamiya.

1019
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:36,088
But look, we're going alone,
so weapons check, comms check.

1020
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:38,131
Make sure you're 100%.
We got no support.

1021
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:39,716
- Hooah?
- Hooah!

1022
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:41,218
You okay? Sergeant P, can
I get a radio check?

1023
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:42,928
Go to one.
Miller, what you are doing?

1024
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:44,429
- Channel one.
- Roger that.

1025
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,931
Look at what's happening.

1026
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:55,273
I just need you to do
your job tonight, Freddy.

1027
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,155
Let's roll!

1028
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:26,531
Thank you all very much.
Admiral Kelly, Captain Card,

1029
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:30,827
officers and sailors
of the USS Abraham Lincoln,

1030
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:33,371
my fellow Americans.

1031
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:37,000
Major combat operations
in Iraq have ended.

1032
01:11:37,085 --> 01:11:39,002
In the battle of Iraq,

1033
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:43,089
the United States and
our allies have prevailed.

1034
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,091
All right!

1035
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,605
Yeah?
This is Briggs.

1036
01:11:58,606 --> 01:12:00,399
We got a problem.

1037
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,234
My local assets are down.

1038
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:06,113
I got a report saying it was US Army
took them out and nobody called it in.

1039
01:12:06,114 --> 01:12:08,072
Where's Miller?

1040
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,699
Stand by.

1041
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:13,370
All right, listen up. I need
everybody on a Blue Force Tracker.

1042
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:15,788
Met-Delta 85th, XTF.

1043
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,217
Sir.

1044
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:37,936
He's moving northwest
towards Adhamiya.

1045
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:39,271
ETA?
Twelve minutes, sir.

1046
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:41,231
ETA, 12 minutes.

1047
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:44,735
He's meeting
with Al Rawi.

1048
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:47,446
Son of a bitch. He's on
his way there right now.

1049
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:48,739
All right, what do
you want me to do?

1050
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:51,033
Follow Miller. He'll
lead you right to him.

1051
01:12:51,034 --> 01:12:54,119
And when you find Al Rawi, you
take that son of a bitch out.

1052
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,579
What about Miller?

1053
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:58,957
He's off reservation.
Miller can't bring in Al Rawi.

1054
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,459
Don't let him
get in the way.

1055
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,335
I want to make
that announcement.

1056
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,170
Now?
Just make it happen!

1057
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:35,285
This is Vanguard 6
on the airborne command.

1058
01:13:35,286 --> 01:13:38,121
I need a C-2 bird
with eyes over Adhamiya.

1059
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:40,665
I want an ISO
on all military radio

1060
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:44,669
and cell phone transmissions
for a three-mile radius.

1061
01:13:45,296 --> 01:13:50,258
Alpha 1, this is Vanguard 6.
Alpha 1, this is Vanguard 6.

1062
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,177
Vanguard 6,
this is Alpha 1.

1063
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:56,389
Alpha 1, I need you to divert to
Adhamiya Central immediately.

1064
01:13:56,390 --> 01:14:00,936
We have a high-value target
identified, Mohammed Al Rawi.

1065
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:04,022
This is a kill,
no capture mission.

1066
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:06,024
Roger that.

1067
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:13,072
Here they are.

1068
01:14:13,825 --> 01:14:16,951
Yeah, I'll tell him.
We're on our way.

1069
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:21,373
Poundstone's just called
a press briefing downstairs.

1070
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:23,916
It's something big, Marty.

1071
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:59,661
This is the bus station.
It's just over there.

1072
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:12,174
Stagger two teams.

1073
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:13,717
I'm going to move
across to the kiosk.

1074
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:17,595
You give me 30 seconds
to get across, then follow.

1075
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:18,990
Someone just showed up.
I'm going to follow.

1076
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:30,334
Two minutes, people. Two
minutes to the announcement.

1077
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:07,371
He's going out
the central alley, west.

1078
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:19,383
Thank you all for coming
at such short notice.

1079
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:22,929
We have a major announcement.

1080
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,889
This follows in lockstep
with our commitment

1081
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:27,392
to eliminate the tyranny
of Saddam Hussein

1082
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:32,230
and expeditiously transform Iraq into
a modern, functioning democracy.

1083
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:34,941
Ambassador Bremer
has just signed an order

1084
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:38,820
immediately disbanding Iraq's
remaining military forces.

1085
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,949
The Coalition Provisional
Authority hereby dissolves

1086
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:47,119
the entirety of Iraq's military
and paramilitary forces,

1087
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:49,080
ministries of defense,

1088
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:54,126
information, military affairs,
intelligence and national security.

1089
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:56,921
All officers,
soldiers, conscripts

1090
01:17:56,922 --> 01:18:00,591
and other military figures
are relieved of duty.

1091
01:18:00,968 --> 01:18:05,346
All military ranks, titles
and status are canceled.

1092
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:11,060
In addition, Iraq's ruling Ba'ath Party
is dissolved with immediate effect.

1093
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:15,857
Party members will be summarily fired from
central and local government offices,

1094
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:20,736
hospitals, universities, schools
and other public institutions.

1095
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:25,367
This is the dawn of new leadership in
Iraq, and let the world take note,

1096
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:28,786
change is coming to
the Middle East at last.

1097
01:18:45,513 --> 01:18:47,639
Still moving southwest.
Southwest.

1098
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,515
Copy that.

1099
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:15,500
You got him?

1100
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:17,793
Yeah, I see him.

1101
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:25,468
I lost contact.

1102
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:41,025
Fuck!
Get an angle!

1103
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:42,694
Fuck,
he's in the vehicle.

1104
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:44,112
- God damn it!
- Stay on Chief!

1105
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:45,196
Where the fuck did they go?

1106
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:46,281
Did he get in the vehicle?

1107
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:48,700
Let's go! Let's go!
This is MET Team "D."

1108
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:51,369
We need help.
American soldier kidnapped!

1109
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:53,204
We need help down here!

1110
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:56,541
All units, we need help
in the Adhamiya district.

1111
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:59,586
Copy that, MET Team.
This is Vanguard 6 and TF221.

1112
01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:01,588
What's your position
and status?

1113
01:20:01,589 --> 01:20:05,133
Vanguard 6, we're five blocks south
of the Adhamiya bus station.

1114
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,218
Kidnappers heading
east in two small cars.

1115
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:09,387
Roger that.
Met-D, I am en route.

1116
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:12,723
I need you to return to your vehicles
and await further instructions.

1117
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:20,231
Falcon 16,
this is Vanguard 6.

1118
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:24,527
We have a US soldier abducted. We
need eyes on those vehicles now!

1119
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:26,946
Vanguard 6,
this is Falcon 16.

1120
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:29,908
Currently two klicks
northeast of Adhamiya.

1121
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:33,286
Establishing an area of perimeter
and sweeping Adhamiya.

1122
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:36,288
AOR 87, Alpha Tango.

1123
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:39,417
We gotta
get him out of there.

1124
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:41,961
Get me Chief Miller now.

1125
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:07,653
They've taken him. God damn it!
They've taken him.

1126
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:23,461
Vanguard 6,
this is Falcon 16.

1127
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:26,630
I've got your two
vehicles moving rapidly.

1128
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:38,268
The two vehicles
just entered a garage.

1129
01:21:38,269 --> 01:21:40,520
There's a large water tower
on top of the building.

1130
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:45,400
Grid Kilo-Zulu-8732-6428.

1131
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:49,987
Alpha 1, I'm going in on foot.
Continue to target. Acknowledge.

1132
01:21:52,616 --> 01:21:55,285
This is Alpha 1. We're three
klicks from target area.

1133
01:21:55,286 --> 01:21:59,205
All right, put us down.
Find an LZ a klick from here.

1134
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:34,842
Who are you?

1135
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:37,261
General, my name's
Roy Miller.

1136
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:40,264
I'm a chief warrant
officer with the US Army.

1137
01:23:40,808 --> 01:23:43,058
What do you want?

1138
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,771
I came here to bring you in.

1139
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:03,037
General, I'm aware that you had
contact with a US official

1140
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,956
in the weeks
leading up to the war.

1141
01:24:06,834 --> 01:24:10,378
I know you were ready to tell them
everything about Iraq's WMD programs.

1142
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:12,463
What programs?

1143
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:15,633
There are no programs.

1144
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:18,636
I told your official.

1145
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:22,097
We dismantled
everything after '91.

1146
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:28,145
He told my government that you confirmed
that the programs were still active.

1147
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:34,318
He lied about what you said.
That's why we're here.

1148
01:24:44,037 --> 01:24:47,623
Did anyone verify
his story?

1149
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:49,959
No.

1150
01:24:52,171 --> 01:24:56,090
Your government wanted
to hear the lie, Mr. Miller.

1151
01:24:57,259 --> 01:25:03,347
They wanted Saddam out, and they
did exactly what they had to do.

1152
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:06,350
This is why you are here.

1153
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:18,153
Go.

1154
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:31,334
Alpha 1, this is Vanguard 6.
Give me your location.

1155
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:33,002
Vanguard 6,
this is Alpha 1.

1156
01:25:33,003 --> 01:25:34,962
We're half a klick away.
Split up.

1157
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:36,380
Alpha team,
take the west side,

1158
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:38,007
Bravo team, take the east
side of the objective.

1159
01:25:38,008 --> 01:25:42,011
I got north-south. Move to assault positions.
Wait for my go.

1160
01:25:42,012 --> 01:25:43,929
ALPHA 1: Roger that.

1161
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:53,897
So, do you have
a message for me?

1162
01:25:57,653 --> 01:26:00,612
General, if you
come in with me,

1163
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:05,326
there are still people in
Washington who will work with you.

1164
01:26:06,036 --> 01:26:09,705
People who understand that
we still need the Iraqi army

1165
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:11,249
to hold this place together.

1166
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:14,918
Then why is your government
disbanding the Army?

1167
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:17,421
Making us outlaws.

1168
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:22,051
Why take Iraq apart
piece by piece?

1169
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:24,678
Why?

1170
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:31,560
I risked my life

1171
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:35,314
to tell you the truth
about WMD.

1172
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:40,778
"Tell the truth and you'll have a
place in the new Iraq," they said.

1173
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:45,032
So where is my place,
Mr. Miller?

1174
01:26:46,743 --> 01:26:49,119
On a deck of cards?

1175
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:38,669
Why are you
really here, Miller?

1176
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:42,297
You were supposed
to lead me into a trap.

1177
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:48,137
You will tell me now how they
are planning to take me.

1178
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:51,515
Everybody in position?

1179
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:54,184
Vanguard Bravo in position.

1180
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:58,981
Vanguard 6, this is Bravo 1.
We're ready.

1181
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:06,947
Vanguard 6, this is Alpha 1.
We're in position.

1182
01:28:12,162 --> 01:28:14,664
You have to come
in with me, General.

1183
01:28:14,665 --> 01:28:18,208
You will get nothing
if you fight us.

1184
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:23,547
You have to come in now
before it's too late.

1185
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:27,092
You think the war is over

1186
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:31,013
just because
you are in Baghdad?

1187
01:28:31,807 --> 01:28:33,891
You will see.

1188
01:28:33,976 --> 01:28:36,477
It has only just begun.

1189
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,312
Let's go.

1190
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:55,413
Grenade!

1191
01:28:55,414 --> 01:28:57,247
Go! Go!

1192
01:29:55,474 --> 01:29:57,975
Come on! Move!

1193
01:30:09,196 --> 01:30:12,447
Let's go. Let's go.

1194
01:30:12,991 --> 01:30:15,576
Man down!
Hit the rooftop!

1195
01:30:15,577 --> 01:30:17,286
Go!

1196
01:30:41,228 --> 01:30:44,062
Clear! Stack on Dutch!

1197
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:48,609
Go!

1198
01:30:57,327 --> 01:31:00,871
"B" Team, go left. Last guy with me.
Let's go!

1199
01:31:12,551 --> 01:31:14,676
I've got something.

1200
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:18,013
Sir, I've got two hostiles
headed east.

1201
01:31:22,561 --> 01:31:26,438
Sir, I got one more. There's
one friendly in pursuit.

1202
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:31,735
Hold!

1203
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:34,405
Vanguard 6,
this is Falcon 16.

1204
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:37,032
Two hostiles and one friendly
have exited target site

1205
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:41,162
and are now moving through alley
northeast of your location.

1206
01:31:41,163 --> 01:31:43,038
Keep the area clear.

1207
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:45,749
I'm activating
my transponder.

1208
01:31:46,585 --> 01:31:49,628
Bring me in.
I want to cut them off.

1209
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:15,862
Down, get down!
Get the fuck down!

1210
01:32:38,637 --> 01:32:40,804
Vanguard 6,
this is Falcon 16.

1211
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:44,516
The targets have lost the friendly.
Targets are now moving north.

1212
01:32:44,517 --> 01:32:48,354
Turn 45 degrees to your left,
maintain intercepting course.

1213
01:32:48,355 --> 01:32:50,272
Turn! Turn!

1214
01:33:23,014 --> 01:33:25,599
I've lost
visual contact.

1215
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:57,172
I've got them!

1216
01:34:08,935 --> 01:34:11,353
Vanguard 6,
this is Falcon 16.

1217
01:34:11,354 --> 01:34:13,105
Keep going
your current direction.

1218
01:34:13,106 --> 01:34:16,942
The target is crossing
open ground, headed north.

1219
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:21,822
RPG!
Shit!

1220
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:08,738
Walk over.

1221
01:37:17,248 --> 01:37:19,082
Stop there.

1222
01:37:24,088 --> 01:37:27,924
You sure this is what they
want back in Washington?

1223
01:37:40,813 --> 01:37:43,189
Put that weapon down!

1224
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:46,609
Now, Freddy!

1225
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:55,869
What the fuck did you do?

1226
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:04,377
It is not for you to
decide what happens here.

1227
01:38:27,694 --> 01:38:30,779
Get out of here,
Freddy. Go home.

1228
01:38:31,531 --> 01:38:33,031
We're gonna be
locking this area down.

1229
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:34,241
There are gonna be
soldiers everywhere.

1230
01:38:34,242 --> 01:38:35,951
Go home now,

1231
01:38:35,952 --> 01:38:37,952
while you can.

1232
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:14,883
Do you think you can form a successful
government without Sunni involvement?

1233
01:40:14,884 --> 01:40:17,511
This is
a new beginning for Iraq.

1234
01:40:17,512 --> 01:40:21,848
This is the end of tyranny and
the beginning of freedom.

1235
01:40:22,183 --> 01:40:24,935
How long will
US forces be in Iraq?

1236
01:40:24,936 --> 01:40:27,687
As long as they are needed.

1237
01:40:27,689 --> 01:40:30,064
Thank you. That's it.

1238
01:40:31,484 --> 01:40:33,568
Clark.
Mr. Zubaidi.

1239
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:34,653
It's a great day.

1240
01:40:34,654 --> 01:40:36,488
Indeed, indeed.
Good to see you.

1241
01:40:36,489 --> 01:40:38,781
Welcome. Welcome.

1242
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:58,760
How are you, gentlemen?
How are you? Good, good.

1243
01:40:58,761 --> 01:41:02,138
So, does this mean there's
going to be an election soon?

1244
01:41:11,232 --> 01:41:14,150
There's been
a democracy deficit.

1245
01:41:16,988 --> 01:41:21,157
Can you comment about the
action last night in Adhamiya?

1246
01:41:23,286 --> 01:41:24,411
Chief Miller.

1247
01:41:24,412 --> 01:41:29,166
It's a copy of my intel report. I
wanted to give it to you personally.

1248
01:41:29,167 --> 01:41:30,333
Thank you.
Is this Al Rawi?

1249
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:31,668
Yeah.

1250
01:41:31,669 --> 01:41:34,170
Yeah, I heard about this.

1251
01:41:42,889 --> 01:41:46,307
There's some pretty
strong language here.

1252
01:41:46,559 --> 01:41:48,643
But what's the point, Miller?

1253
01:41:48,644 --> 01:41:51,021
Do you think anybody's
going to listen to you?

1254
01:41:51,022 --> 01:41:53,398
I know what you did.

1255
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:56,359
What did you say?

1256
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:58,487
You made him up
to get what you needed.

1257
01:41:58,488 --> 01:42:01,155
Magellan.
You made him up.

1258
01:42:01,657 --> 01:42:05,243
I don't know what
you're talking about, Miller.

1259
01:42:05,787 --> 01:42:08,079
When you peddled that shit in
DC, did they know it was a lie?

1260
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:09,498
Or did they just
never bother to ask?

1261
01:42:09,499 --> 01:42:10,791
Okay, okay.

1262
01:42:10,792 --> 01:42:13,877
Come on, none of this matters anymore.
WMD? This doesn't matter.

1263
01:42:13,878 --> 01:42:16,213
What the fuck are you talking about?
Of course, it fucking matters.

1264
01:42:16,214 --> 01:42:18,423
The reasons we go to
war always matter!

1265
01:42:18,424 --> 01:42:21,469
It's all that fucking matters.
It fucking matters.

1266
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:23,680
At ease, soldier.

1267
01:42:25,725 --> 01:42:28,184
Do you have any idea
what you've done here?

1268
01:42:28,185 --> 01:42:30,854
What's going to happen next time
we need people to trust us?

1269
01:42:30,855 --> 01:42:31,979
Clark!

1270
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:33,899
We're not turning
back, Miller.

1271
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:35,024
We won.

1272
01:42:35,025 --> 01:42:36,149
Clark!

1273
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:39,320
Son of a bitch. What?
