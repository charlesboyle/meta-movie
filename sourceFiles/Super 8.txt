1
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,018
I'm so worried for that boy.

2
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,195
Joe's gonna be okay.

3
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,069
She was everything to him.

4
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,203
Jack's gonna step up. He's a good man.

5
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,031
But he's never had to be a father before.

6
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:58,877
I don't think he understands Joe.

7
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,165
How long did Elizabeth work there?

8
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,755
- Five years?
- No, I think it was six.

9
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,258
- What do you think was in the coffin?
- Jesus, shut up.

10
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,181
I'm just saying, 'cause of how she died.

11
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,391
You guys weren't wondering that?

12
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,219
No. I'm eating macaroni salad.

13
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,645
I was wondering about that, too.

14
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,639
I heard it crushed her completely.

15
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,358
Steel beam, those things
weigh a ton. Literally.

16
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,185
I don't know how you guys can eat.

17
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,736
Try a turkey roll and you'll discover how.

18
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,812
Lucy, down!

19
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,526
Get down.

20
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,738
Joe? You seen Joe?

21
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,656
Bet Joe's not gonna
want to do my movie any more.

22
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:32,903
Why?

23
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,956
Why do you think why?
The story, it's about the living dead.

24
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,910
- His mother's not a zombie.
- But she's dead, shithead.

25
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,119
- These turkey rolls are pretty good.
- Told you.

26
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,990
- I just want to talk to you, Jack.
- Get him out of here.

27
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,949
- Hey, Dainard.
- Would you just wait a minute? Wait!

28
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,578
- Jack! Jack, just let me...
- No.

29
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,662
Get out!

30
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,539
Get out!

31
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,044
Hey, Jack!

32
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,045
- I knew this was a mistake.
- Jack, I...

33
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,346
Jack...

34
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,359
Joseph, I'll be home soon.

35
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,402
Oh, my God.
That was the longest day, ever. Here.

36
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,737
- What's this?
- New scene. Check it out.

37
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,027
Detective Hathaway has a wife now?

38
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,904
I don't know.
I think it might make a better movie.

39
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,030
- I need a better storyline...
- Hey!

40
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,156
- ...And production value.
- Guys!

41
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,203
Hey, guys.
Martin barfed all over his locker today.

42
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,405
It was the grossest one yet.

43
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,332
- Oh, my God! Shut up!
- I never seen so many colors in my life.

44
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,659
So who's gonna play the wife? Jen?

45
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,710
No way.
I told you what she did with my top hat.

46
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,167
- What wife?
- Alice Dainard.

47
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,633
I was returning that book on
codes and ciphers.

48
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,551
She was in the silent reading section.

49
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,963
And I asked her
if she'd play Hathaway's wife.

50
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,215
Wait.
You talked to Alice Dainard, really?

51
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,346
You're not supposed to talk at all
in the silent reading section.

52
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,893
- Shut up.
- It's for silent reading.

53
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,438
She said "Yes."
We're filming tonight, and she's driving.

54
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,687
Driving? Driving where?

55
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,630
That was a really good zombie murder.

56
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,424
Yeah, but it's not a story yet.

57
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,384
Older kids are entering this film festival,

58
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,303
15 and 16-year-olds,
who have better stories and

59
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,592
cars and production value.
I've got nothing.

60
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,598
- Charles, dinner!
- I'm coming!

61
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:48,687
There's this article I want you to read.
It explains everything about stories.

62
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,564
I just don't understand
how the wife helps make it a story.

63
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,236
Jesus, this is what I've been explaining.

64
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,235
That scene we're filming tonight,
where the wife is telling the detective

65
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,191
that she's scared for him,
that she loves him.

66
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,697
I can't believe
you talked to Alice Dainard.

67
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,245
- Charles, come on, move it.
- I'm coming!

68
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,206
And wash your hands this time.

69
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:08,752
So when he investigates
the zombie stuff, you feel something.

70
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,125
You don't want him to die
because they love each other.

71
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,585
That make sense?

72
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,211
Alice Dainard. That's awesome.

73
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,177
- You're impossible.
- Charles! Now!

74
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,513
God, Mom, I'm coming!

75
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,849
- Midnight, okay? Don't forget.
- I won't forget.

76
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,684
Read this.

77
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,769
It's not fair that I can't go to Wendy's.

78
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,392
Every single person will be there,
except me.

79
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,314
Well, then every single person
can tell you how it was.

80
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,733
Move the puzzle, get the napkins.

81
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,481
- Mom...
- It's your turn to babysit.

82
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,652
Why can't I switch with Charles?

83
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,196
Maybe because you crushed
Charles' top hat.

84
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,238
You ever think of that?

85
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,907
Oh, really? Well, guess what?
We're switching.

86
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,609
Oh, really? 'Cause guess what?
No, we're not.

87
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:44,322
That's enough. Charles, take this
to the table. Benji, time for dinner!

88
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:45,614
Hey, Joe.

89
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,244
Night, Mrs. Kaznyk.

90
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,667
Take a seat. We have lots of food.

91
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,119
No, I'm okay. Really. Thank you, though.

92
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,420
- Put them at the table.
- See you tomorrow, Charles.

93
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,496
Later days.

94
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,250
There's always a place
for you here, Joe. You know that.

95
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,425
Stop it!

96
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,252
Yes, sir. Thank you.

97
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,602
Dad?

98
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,949
Dad?

99
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,199
That possibility with an announcement
that, while it is not likely,

100
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,498
the potential is there
for the ultimate risk of a meltdown

101
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,076
at the Three Mile Island
atomic power plant

102
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,957
outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

103
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,289
Robert Schakne reports
from Washington.

104
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,591
According to the government's top...

105
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,668
Hey.

106
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:41,795
I'll be out in a minute.

107
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,774
It's a six-week program.

108
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,948
Hands-on training with college coaches.

109
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,526
You'd like it. I know I did.

110
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,409
I thought I was gonna have
the summer for myself.

111
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,832
Well, things
have obviously changed for us.

112
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,873
And it'd be good for you
to spend some time

113
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,581
with kids who don't run around
with cameras and monster make-up.

114
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,921
I have to help Charles finish his movie.

115
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,604
I've got nothing against your friends.
I like your friends.

116
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,442
Except for Cary, who can't seem
to stop lighting things on fire.

117
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,112
You'd like it there.

118
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,706
It's what we both need.

119
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,430
But they offered you
no real proof he was alive.

120
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,979
And you didn't.
The decision was made.

121
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,479
- So leave the past alone, Martha.
- I can't.

122
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,741
Well, how much would
a ton of gold be worth today?

123
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,494
Okay, it's time. Don't get caught. Oven

124
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,745
I won't. Over.

125
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,122
You, my little pretty one,
my pretty one

126
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:44,176
When you gonna give me
some time, Sharona?

127
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,508
Ooh you make my motor run,
my motor run

128
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,098
Wait, so, guys, people are turning
into zombies

129
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,392
because of the chemical factory, right?

130
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,095
I don't see how the guy
playing Detective Hathaway

131
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:58,182
can ask where the zombies
are coming from. Jesus.

132
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,686
Well, technically,
Hathaway hasn't even...

133
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,858
Shut up.

134
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,441
- Was that a rock?
- I'm sorry, Smartin.

135
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,274
- It was a Twizzler!
- Hey, where'd it go?

136
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,943
Hey, guys, look.
Guys, look! Guys!

137
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,670
- It's okay, Smartin.
- Shut up.

138
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,922
Hey, Alice.

139
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,375
Joe Lamb?

140
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:26,964
Yeah.

141
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,386
What the hell's he doing here?

142
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,839
Make-up, sound and special effects.

143
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,048
He's the Deputy's kid!

144
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,637
- So what?
- You knew that?

145
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,936
Charles, I don't have a license.
I can't drive with him.

146
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,231
You want Joe to stay back? I guess...

147
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,809
It's too late!
He's seeing me in the car right now!

148
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,194
You can trust me.

149
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,817
My dad will never know.

150
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,824
I won't tell him anything.

151
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,202
Get in.

152
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,500
So, I wrote a couple newlines.
Can I show you?

153
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,001
- What?
- New lines?

154
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,176
Charles, do I have newlines?

155
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,299
Do you know what'd be great?

156
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,052
Is if you could cry during the scene.
Can you do that?

157
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,929
- I'm impressed.
- No.

158
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,010
You know the first place I'm gonna drive
when I get my license?

159
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,845
- Want one?
- New Castle, Pennsylvania.

160
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:19,929
Fireworks Capital of America.

161
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,643
Wait, so, I don't have newlines, right?
Because I just learned these.

162
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,081
Guys, there's an electrical outlet
up here.

163
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,453
Of anything, why that?

164
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,292
- Charles!
- Got it.

165
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,420
Charles, man, do I have newlines
or not? Oh, no!

166
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,291
Well, you just lost all your newlines,
Martin.

167
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,752
Guys, this is going to be great!

168
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,385
Get the lights and camera set up
on that end,

169
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,681
we'll shoot this direction first.

170
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,799
Joe, get the mike plugged in

171
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,556
and make sure that
the new batteries are in the camera

172
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,478
- before you do the make-up.
- Okay. Okay.

173
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,816
I took apart two packs of cherry bombs
and I made my own M-80.

174
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,143
Do you want to see it?

175
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:10,105
Your obsession with fireworks,
and I'm saying this as a friend,

176
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,782
concerns me and my mother.

177
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,656
"Sweetheart, this is my job.
I have no choice.

178
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,237
"It's nothing that you need
to worry about.

179
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,414
"What am I supposed to do,
go to Michigan with you?

180
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,787
- "Sweetheart, this is my job."
- Martin! I wrote a newline.

181
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,745
- What? No.
- What do you mean "no"? it's awesome.

182
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,002
- Okay, so, you know that part when...
- I just finished memorizing this line.

183
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,958
- It's not gonna be hard...
- Do you mind?

184
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,088
- So, you know that part when you say...
- No.

185
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,842
- Well, where'd the other line go?
- It's gone. This one's better.

186
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,343
Here, I'll...

187
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:40,686
- No, it didn't.
- I've never even had any lines.

188
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,850
- I just needed this one.
- There.

189
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,226
Thanks.

190
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,306
Look, look. Look!

191
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,607
Now I'm not prepared!

192
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:52,110
Look, it flows better. "Honey, I love you."
"I love you, too." See? It flows.

193
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,488
I know, but you keep changing things
and making it more difficult for me.

194
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,662
It's... Martin, it's simple.
"I love you, too."

195
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,784
it's, like, four words.

196
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,706
My dad works at the mill.

197
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,951
Four words that I don't
have memorized.

198
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,877
Martin. Can you say, "I love you"?

199
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,965
Could you close your eyes, please?

200
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,587
Yeah.

201
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,515
So, the scene is very emotional.

202
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,310
Alice, Mrs. Hathaway really doesn't want
her husband

203
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,481
to keep
investigating these zombie murders.

204
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,730
- Yeah, I know. We read it. We get it.
- You really hate it.

205
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,944
God, I'm just directing.

206
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,860
Martin. Martin, get in position.

207
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,987
You need to reassure her.

208
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,909
Wait. Do you know
what "reassure her" means?

209
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,783
Yeah, I think so.

210
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,072
Okay. We're gonna shoot
on Alice's side first.

211
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:46,034
Okay, Preston, so,
a few seconds after I say "action,"

212
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,209
I want you to walk over to the pay phone.

213
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,083
You know,
make the place look like it's busy.

214
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,460
- "Hello, hello?"
- I know what that looks like.

215
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,469
Asshole! Could you stop blowing shit up
for two seconds

216
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,546
and deal with the camera?

217
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,093
God. Sorry, man.

218
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,391
Okay, you guys, let's rehearse this.

219
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,471
But remember, save the real
performance for when we're filming.

220
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:09,266
Here we go. Positions, and action!

221
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,727
So, I'm going to stay here
and investigate.

222
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,274
I think it'd be safer
if you left town for a couple of days.

223
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,949
John, I don't like it.
This case. These murders.

224
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,493
Well, what am I supposed to do,
go to Michigan with you?

225
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,952
Mackinac Island's beautiful
this time of year.

226
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,329
Sweetheart, this is my job.

227
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,336
The dead coming back to life?

228
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,126
- I think you're in danger.
- I have no...

229
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,292
I have no choice.

230
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,294
You do have a choice.

231
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,463
We all do.

232
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,139
John,

233
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,809
I've never asked you to stop.

234
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,983
I've never asked you to give up,
or walk away,

235
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,486
but I'm asking you now.

236
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,739
Please.

237
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,824
For me.

238
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,654
Don't go. Don't leave me.

239
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,334
I need to know this isn't the last time
I'm going to see you.

240
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,505
I just love you so much.

241
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,430
I love you, too.

242
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,184
Was that good?

243
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:34,567
Yeah. Yeah, that was... That was great.

244
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,744
Production value!

245
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,869
- Cary, you put film in the camera, right?
- I didn't put it in.

246
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,997
What? Put it in, put it in!
Joe, get the mike ready! Go, go, go!

247
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,333
- Get in costume, costume, costume!
- Okay, I will.

248
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,666
Joe, help her! Hurry up!
Martin, get that tripod set up!

249
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,342
- Preston, get in position!
- I will. I have to get the money.

250
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,466
Go! Get these headphones ready!

251
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,800
Martin, you know your lines!

252
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,008
- Hurry! Get that camera ready! Go, go!
- Shut up!

253
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,467
We'll start on Alice and pan
to the train, right?

254
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,847
Oh, God, I hope we don't miss it!

255
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,808
Shut up! I am trying!

256
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,019
Hurry! Get that set up!
Let's go! Positions, positions!

257
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:20,189
Ready. Start filming.
Be extra loud when the train passes by.

258
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,024
Here we go. And action!

259
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,365
Look, I'm going to stay here
and investigate.

260
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:30,073
I think it'd be safer
if you left town for a couple of days.

261
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,913
John, I don't like it.
This case. These murders.

262
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,916
What do you want me to do,
go to Michigan with you?

263
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,506
Mackinac Island's beautiful
this time of year.

264
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:45,843
The dead coming back to life?
I think you're in danger!

265
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,094
I don't have a choice!

266
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,683
You do have a choice!

267
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,100
We all do!

268
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,014
John, I've never asked you to stop!

269
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,602
I've never asked you to give up
or walk away!

270
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,856
But I'm asking you now!
Please, for me,

271
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,529
just don't go!

272
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,612
Just don't go back! Don't leave me!

273
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,370
I need to know this isn't the last time
I'm going to see you!

274
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,328
- I love you so much!
- I love you, too!

275
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,454
- Guys, watch out!
- Joe, what the hell are you...

276
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,631
- Oh, my God!
- Run!

277
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,129
- Oh, my God!
- Go!

278
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,013
Holy shit!

279
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,185
Go, go, go!

280
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,392
Alice!

281
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,569
Joe, let's go! We got to go!

282
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,532
- Keep going!
- Are we alive?

283
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,844
I don't want to die!

284
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:16,679
Oh, my God!

285
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,399
Guys.

286
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,156
I'm okay.

287
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,116
Martin, you okay?

288
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:01,334
Though I think I'm having a heart attack.
And I have a scrape.

289
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,789
Joe! Oh, my God!

290
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,626
- Guys, did you see those explosions?
- You guys seen Alice?

291
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,256
That was unbelievable!

292
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:13,046
- Why did this happen?
- Martin, it's gonna be okay.

293
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,552
No, it's not, dude. Look at this.

294
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,476
Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit.

295
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,105
What's all that blood?

296
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,202
What's the blood?
Did someone get hurt?

297
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,075
- Joe, what are you doing?
- Joe, stop!

298
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,833
- Don't put your hand under there!
- Joe, you don't know what's under there!

299
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,254
Joe!

300
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,211
It's my fake blood!

301
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,841
It's fake.

302
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,675
Guys?

303
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,674
- Come here. What are these things?
- Shit.

304
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,138
No one cares! Look around you!

305
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,060
They look like white Rubik's Cubes,
or something.

306
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,479
I don't think that's what they are.
They don't move.

307
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,808
They're heavy, like metal or something.
There's like a billion of them!

308
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,017
What's going on?

309
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,482
- Martin, it's gonna be okay, all right?
- Are you serious?

310
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,235
You guys! Get up here.
You can see everything from up here!

311
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,740
Joe!

312
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,507
According to my Uncle Seth,

313
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,883
an accident like this
is exceptionally rare.

314
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,218
- It wasn't an accident.
- What?

315
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,720
- There was a truck on the train tracks.
- Are you serious?

316
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,053
What, like, driving on the tracks?

317
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,558
There.

318
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,896
Oh, my gosh.

319
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:57,233
How could a pickup truck
derail a train, man? That's impossible.

320
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,530
Obviously, it isn't.

321
00:21:58,609 --> 00:21:59,826
Holy shit!

322
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,324
Oh, my God. I know that truck.

323
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,243
Guys.

324
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,794
Is that him?

325
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,248
Yeah. it's him.

326
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:15,919
- Who?
- It is. Yeah, for sure.

327
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,761
Who is it?

328
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,433
Dr. Woodward.

329
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,101
Dr. Woodward, the science guy?

330
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,770
- Biology.
- Honors Biology.

331
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:30,274
- Wow. I'm not in his class.
- We know.

332
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,601
Just shut up, Cary.

333
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,445
Remember when Old Man Woodward
took your Electronic Football?

334
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,402
Yeah. He put it in the dungeon
and never gave it back.

335
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:42,908
The dungeon?

336
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,786
That trailer Woodward keeps
in the school parking lot.

337
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,495
Dr. Woodward?

338
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,960
Dr. Woodward?

339
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,803
"Map of the Contiguous United States."

340
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,513
What's the writing?

341
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:09,805
Dates and times.

342
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,686
Guys, what's this line?

343
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,356
It's a schedule for the train.

344
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:16,900
What the...

345
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,732
He's alive. He's alive!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

346
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,158
Holy shit.

347
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,580
Who are you?

348
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,996
Dr. Woodward, it's me.

349
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,174
Charles Kaznyk. From fourth period.

350
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,798
You've been in an accident.
You're gonna be okay.

351
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:43,051
- Back!
- Holy shit! Holy shit!

352
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,347
They will kill you.

353
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,935
Do not speak of this.

354
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,266
Or else you

355
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,108
and your parents

356
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,863
will die.

357
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,989
Guys, look.

358
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,870
- We shouldn't be here.
- Oh, my God!

359
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,455
- Go!
- Come on!

360
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,830
- Shit! Let's get the hell out of here!
- Holy shit! Run! Shit!

361
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,499
Guys, there are a lot of nails
on the ground. Be careful.

362
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,921
Hurry, come on, guys!

363
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,839
Guys, come on!

364
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,587
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Holy shit!

365
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,260
Grab the film!

366
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:24,680
Guys, come on!

367
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,266
Move your ass! Let's go! Let's go!

368
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,972
- Who's got the bags?
- Get in the car!

369
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:32,846
Get in!

370
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,607
They're getting closer!

371
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,732
Come on!

372
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,414
- Anybody get their plates?
- I didn't get the plate. Did you get it?

373
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,034
All clear.

374
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,964
Holy shit! That was insane!

375
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,338
- He had a gun! An actual physical gun!
- Oh, shit!

376
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:08,015
My heart is pounding!
That train could've killed us!

377
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,216
Are you okay?

378
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,097
- Oh, shit! My camera's shattered now.
- No.

379
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,520
Guys, I have never had a teacher
aim a gun at me!

380
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,268
It's hard enough to drive
without everyone yelling!

381
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,439
Guys, keep it down.

382
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:21,020
"You'll die. Your parents will die."
Guys, this is not good information!

383
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,318
Oh, shit! The focus ring just fell off!

384
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:24,944
No one cares about your camera!

385
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:28,369
Guys, am I the only one shaking?
And I'm also crying!

386
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:31,539
We can't tell anyone we were there.
My dad can't find out I took his car.

387
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,614
Do you guys hear me?

388
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:35,793
It's okay.
We're not saying anything to anyone.

389
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,297
Guys!
We're not saying anything, are we?

390
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,508
- No.
- No.

391
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,384
See?

392
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,466
No one's going to know.

393
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,468
No one's saying anything.

394
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,021
Joe.

395
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,152
Thanks.

396
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,814
I never should have done this.

397
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,192
Joe. Joe, wake up.

398
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,856
- Make sure you let Lucy out, all right?
- Okay. I will.

399
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,318
What are you gonna do?
You going to be with Charles today?

400
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,777
Yeah. I'll be with Charles.

401
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,988
All right. I'm heading in.
There's something I got to deal with.

402
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:55,539
- Don't forget to get the yard.
- I will.

403
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,760
Mom, come on!

404
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,048
No! You are not wearing that.
No one in this house is wearing that.

405
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,224
Oh, really?
Compared to Debbie's, these are long.

406
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,300
Listen to your mother.

407
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:18,228
So, I can't go to Wendy's party
or wear the shorts? Not fair!

408
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,305
Jennifer Anne, "not fair" is Africa.

409
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,065
Mom's racist!

410
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,810
- Do we have any more English muffins?
- Why don't you get up and check.

411
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,112
- Peg, tell the twins to stop.
- I can't, they don't listen.

412
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,905
- Morning, Joe.
- Good morning, Mr. Kaznyk.

413
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:31,404
Hey, Joe.
Did you hear about the train crash?

414
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,236
- No.
- It's on the news.

415
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:38,533
Instead opting to use
military personnel,

416
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,869
which for this reporter
only adds to the mystery.

417
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,001
Of course, we'll have much more
on this story as it develops.

418
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,505
Coming to you live from Montgomery
County, Channel 14 News...

419
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,257
Can you believe this?

420
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,591
No.

421
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:54,473
- It's on the news, that means it's real.
- I know.

422
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:56,516
Local teacher Thomas Woodward
is still being treated

423
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,812
by Air Force medical personnel
after last night's train derailment.

424
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,681
Woodward apparently fell asleep
at the wheel of his pickup truck,

425
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,232
which was hit by the speeding train.

426
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,060
- This is gross!
- Well, how about you clean it up?

427
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:08,396
That would be a great help.
Thanks so much.

428
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:12,108
Derailment, the largest such accident
in Ohio 's history.

429
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:13,442
The condition of Woodward,

430
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,199
who has taught at Lillian Middle School
for the past six years...

431
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,326
Looks like a disaster movie. Doesn't it?

432
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,079
Oh, my God.

433
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,376
Sit down!

434
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,954
Joe, that's awesome.

435
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,292
- What?
- We can use it. We can film it.

436
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,627
You want to go back?

437
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,716
- Holy shit, that's mint.
- Really?

438
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:34,796
You're a total brain.

439
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,927
We gotta go get the camera fixed

440
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:37,633
- and the film developed from last night.
- Okay.

441
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,889
I'm gonna go steal some money
from my mom.

442
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,101
If any of the footage is
usable from last night,

443
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,309
that means we need Alice
to play the wife again.

444
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,564
Oh, yeah. I thought she was really good.

445
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,567
Dude, she was mint,
but she's never gonna do it.

446
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:51,989
I think She will.

447
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,740
There's no way.
You heard what she said.

448
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,442
Well, that was before
the new scenes, right?

449
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,825
You honestly think she cares about
the scenes? She was totally wigged.

450
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,372
Yeah, she was. We all were.

451
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:04,039
Lens is cracked.
Focus ring broke.

452
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,169
You think it's fixable?

453
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:07,997
I think it's cheaper to buy a new one.

454
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,207
The camera's busted, man. it's over.

455
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,842
We can use my dad's camera.

456
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,217
- It's got some...
- Hello?

457
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,593
- Hey, Alice. It's Joe Lamb.
- Hi.

458
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,848
So, we have some new scenes
for the movie

459
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,518
and Charles and I were hoping
you'd be in them.

460
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,689
No. No, I'm done with that.

461
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,108
I need this film developed
as soon as possible.

462
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,309
Can you do overnight?

463
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,649
Asshole, no one can do overnight.

464
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,649
You want to buy some pot?

465
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,951
No. No, thank you.

466
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,279
Well, what's the fastest you can do?

467
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:44,037
I can make it a rush.
You'll get your film back in three days.

468
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:48,041
Hey, what's your sister up to?
The hot one, not the other one.

469
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:49,788
I don't know.

470
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,798
I'm watching the crash on the news.

471
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,713
- Yeah. I saw it.
- I should go.

472
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,466
Wait. Hold on. Let me come over
and I'll bring the scenes...

473
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:59,298
- No, no. Don't. Don't come...
- I'll be right there. it's a good idea.

474
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,308
I don't care what Charles wants.
I said no on the phone.

475
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,478
You totally did, I know that's true, but...

476
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,430
But now you're at my house.

477
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:07,769
I am. Which...

478
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,608
I don't understand how you guys can
keep working on that stupid movie.

479
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,900
You should go.

480
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,709
What's this?

481
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,204
He was just inviting me to a party.

482
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,007
- Yeah?
- Good morning, Mr. Dainard.

483
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,178
She's not going to your party.

484
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:39,759
Yes, Sir.

485
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,223
You. Get out of here.

486
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,189
You go home and
you don't come back here!

487
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,151
I don't want to see you.

488
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,650
Ally, come inside!

489
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,826
Ally, I'm in the kitchen.

490
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,131
I'll do it.

491
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:18,960
What?

492
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,723
Cut! That was mint!

493
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,852
Oh, my God. With the train...
So good!

494
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,478
- Joe, reload the cap gun.
- Okay.

495
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,980
We'll shoot another angle next.
Alice, that was mint.

496
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,858
Martin, go a little faster next time.

497
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,654
I'll try, Charles, but I'm still crying about
last night, man. I feel like I'm crazy.

498
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,989
Guys, did it really look good?
My death?

499
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:45,162
- Dude, it looked awesome.
- That was magic.

500
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,660
What do you think happened?

501
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,455
You mean why he crashed the train?

502
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,795
I just got a horrible feeling.

503
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,671
Dude, what are you doing?

504
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,610
That whole thing's an Air Force train.

505
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:17,978
What?

506
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:21,482
I make models. Like, plastic ones.
You know, glue them, paint them...

507
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:24,364
- And he's not embarrassed by that.
- Look who's talking, Math Camp!

508
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,616
Thanks. Can I have a coffee, please?
Cream on the side.

509
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,038
- Sure.
- He's so sophisticated.

510
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:30,536
- Shut up. I like coffee.
- No one likes coffee.

511
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,368
Air Force trains, even the models,
have these hooks...

512
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:36,296
They do! For when the trains are
loaded on the transport ships.

513
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,964
Every car in that crash had hooks.

514
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,837
Joe, would you stop
talking about it, all right?

515
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:40,963
Wait, guys.

516
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,465
Am I the only one who doesn't
understand what any of this means?

517
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,717
- Probably, Smartin.
- Cary, shut up.

518
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,340
- You shut up.
- I don't like it when you call me that.

519
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,050
I'm sorry, Smartin.
Let's just go cry about it.

520
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,726
Dr. Woodward had that map.
He drove onto the train tracks.

521
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,057
Maybe there was something
he wanted to...

522
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,310
- To destroy, yeah!
- My God, will you guys just shut up?

523
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,736
Maybe he was just sick of being old
and wanted to kill himself.

524
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,983
That's a dumb idea.

525
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,314
He had a gun. Why not use that?

526
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:06,618
There are infinitely more effective ways
to commit suicide. Pills, hanging...

527
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,741
Pussy! Stop taking the fries away.

528
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,868
- I ordered these for a reason.
- Excuse me.

529
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,450
Could we get another order of fries?
Because my friend here is fat.

530
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,582
Funny, chompers. At least I don't have
to use a booster seat.

531
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,372
You could jump from a building.

532
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,049
- Or fall down some stairs.
- Well, that's not really effective.

533
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:24,010
If it's the Air Force, what would
the Air Force have on the train?

534
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,587
Jesus, shut up about it.

535
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,383
You heard what Old Man Woodward
said, we can't talk about this.

536
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:32,102
Joe, seriously.
Do you really wanna take a chance

537
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,850
that something could happen
to your dad, too?

538
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,401
All right, easy, easy!

539
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,953
- It's loaded. Move out.
- Yes, sir.

540
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,707
Yes, Deputy. I'm told this crash has
caused a whole mess of confusion.

541
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,413
Well, as you can expect,
the local authorities

542
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,965
are trying to figure out just what
happened, as well as how to help you.

543
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,293
It's all under control.
It'll be a very fast clean-up.

544
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,169
Colonel, there isn't anything
that I should know, is there?

545
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,217
Not that I can think of, Deputy.

546
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,515
I understand you have concerns
about our cargo.

547
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,350
Well, I'd like to see that manifest, yes.

548
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,136
Well, that's not gonna be possible.

549
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,804
Colonel, I've got a lot of people
in my town

550
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,730
that are gonna wanna know
what's taking place.

551
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,520
Which town is that?

552
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,691
Lillian.

553
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:24,654
Deputy, if you're asking me if we had
any dangerous properly

554
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,733
on board this train,
I can assure you the answer is "No."

555
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,234
Colonel!

556
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,701
Excuse me.

557
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,214
They gave me the runaround
for two hours

558
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,667
before they allowed me
to talk to anyone.

559
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,672
I'd say they've had their hands full, Jack.

560
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,879
Nelec, the Colonel, refused to
show me the manifest.

561
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:51,715
He told me they're carrying mostly
airplane parts. I don't buy that.

562
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,642
It's Air Force, Jack.
Airplane parts sort of make sense.

563
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,145
Sheriff, I'm telling you,
there's something else going on.

564
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,815
They're taking molds of tire tracks.
Why would they be doing that?

565
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,107
Who would they be looking for?

566
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,857
And they're packaging these
weird little cubes into these crates.

567
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:05,945
Weird little cubes?

568
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:09,116
Yeah, they're loading them onto these
red trucks. There are dozens of them.

569
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,158
Sheriff, I think you need to go
check it out.

570
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,702
And I think you need to take a break.

571
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,914
Jack, I've been telling you this
since Elizabeth.

572
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,367
You're a good deputy,
but you need to take a vacation.

573
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:23,080
Go home. Take off the uniform.
Go fishing. Give your son a hug.

574
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:41,690
Hey, Breen, I'm not sure Edie's
paying you to listen to the radio.

575
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:44,726
Breen!

576
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,237
Hey, Sheriff.

577
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,487
What's that?

578
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:52,360
Walkman. It's like a stereo.
Play your own cassette tapes.

579
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:53,693
You want to try?

580
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,491
I don't think so.

581
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,574
Kids walking around with their
own stereos, just what we need.

582
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:00,743
It's a slippery slope, my friend.

583
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,502
Yes, Sir.

584
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,138
Sheriff?

585
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:51,979
Sheriff?

586
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,744
You know, in scene... Where is it?

587
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,251
Where'd you learn to do this?

588
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,249
Mostly the Dick Smith
Monster Make-up Handbook.

589
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,797
Hey, Joe. We need some more
footage of the train crash.

590
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:53,919
Obviously.

591
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,500
You know that train model
you just made?

592
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,711
- Your cargo train.
- I want to blow it up and film it.

593
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,592
Let me blow it up.

594
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,261
Yeah. Sure.

595
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:03,766
- Mint!
- Gnarly! Yes!

596
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:06,386
Here, take this, will you?

597
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:12,234
It's fine. They can blow it up.
I don't care.

598
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,362
You want to see it? The train?

599
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,948
My train model? The train I made?

600
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:22,235
Dude, that's bitching.

601
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,695
Dude, that's like the third time
it's happened.

602
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:24,825
What the hell?

603
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,077
So how am I supposed to be a zombie?

604
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:34,293
Pretty much just be a lifeless ghoul,
with no soul. Dead eyes.

605
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,250
Scary. Did you ever have Mrs. Mullin?

606
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,131
- For English? Yeah.
- Yeah.

607
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,758
Kind of like her,
but hungry for human flesh.

608
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,136
Like she wants to turn
somebody into a zombie.

609
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,176
'Cause that's Kind of what zombies do.

610
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,908
Oh, my God, yeah. That's really good.

611
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,886
Not bad.

612
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,888
- Really?
- Really.

613
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:38,274
Careful! There was a gas spill.
I don't even know how much fuel I lost.

614
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,230
You don't seem to be asking
very many questions.

615
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,031
Give the man some time, Mr. Blakely.

616
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,659
- He's only a deputy, he's not the Sheriff.
- Doesn't matter.

617
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:48,197
I think this is most likely a bear attack.

618
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,995
Security cameras showed nothing.
Someone had erased...

619
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,247
Vicky, you heard
from Sheriff Pruitt this morning?

620
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:55,169
Negative. Still no word.

621
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,423
Vicky, you need to have Dayton
send a C.S. unit out to Edie's,

622
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:04,721
and you put an A.P.B. out on the Sheriff
and Breen Haskell,

623
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,595
and send units over to their houses
immediately. You copy all that?

624
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:12,054
Copy. And, Jack,
we 're getting a lot of unusual calls.

625
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:14,059
What kinds of unusual calls?

626
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,357
I've never seen this kind of thing before.

627
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,059
I mean,
what the hell am I supposed to do?

628
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,362
The insurance company guy
thought I was joking with him.

629
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,405
Look at my Bonneville over here!

630
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,321
They'd have to have
a winch to take that out.

631
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,619
You been having any
troubles with anyone lately, Izzy?

632
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:30,614
Well, I was thinking
you should talk to Louis Dainard.

633
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,451
Yeah. I didn't help him out
with financing last year,

634
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:38,084
and I wouldn't be surprised if this was
some sort of sick retribution.

635
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,711
- My generator is missing.
- The phones aren't working.

636
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,589
- My dog's gone. Disappeared.
- The phones won't produce a signal.

637
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,045
Call the station and file a report.

638
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,756
I'll have someone come out
and take care of each one of you. Okay?

639
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:10,116
Lucy!

640
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,457
Lucy!

641
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,196
I got four guys on this case...

642
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,740
People don't feel safe around here.
You know why? Because they're not.

643
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,907
We need to get the National Guard...

644
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,405
Air Force hasn't
answered a damn question.

645
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,237
They've got trucks over at
Woodward's house.

646
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,118
Now, Ben heard they were looking
for Woodward's research.

647
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:55,198
Research? What the hell?

648
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,375
Shotgun in one of those trucks,
he had, like, a scanner in his hand.

649
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,417
Like a Geiger counter.

650
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,211
They're saying it's just clean up
at the crash site, too,

651
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,959
but they're taking molds of tire tracks.

652
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,632
That means they're looking for
someone. Now what does that mean?

653
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,213
Have you seen Lucy anywhere?

654
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,965
No. I'm sure
she's around somewhere.

655
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:15,177
I put a couple of slices
in the fridge for you there.

656
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,103
I ate those.

657
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,602
- Sorry, kid.
- Yeah, no problem. I'll find something.

658
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,024
- Hey!
- You got to be kidding.

659
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,195
Pick that up, will you?

660
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,574
Hey, Vicky,
you got power down at the station?

661
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,448
On and off
And Brook County's in the dark.

662
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:35,155
Do me a favor and get Water & Power
out there right now, will you?

663
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:38,333
So, the Air Force is looking for a car.
Alice's dad's car.

664
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:41,286
They're taking tire prints
from the crash site. Over.

665
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,666
I don't want to hear about it.

666
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,715
This is what I've been talking about.
They could be monitoring us right now.

667
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:48,711
Jesus, shut up. Over.

668
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:51,762
And the military is at Woodward's house
looking for his research.

669
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,090
Whatever that means.

670
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,640
You cannot flake out on me
and be a dick.

671
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,558
Are you gonna come and
help me tomorrow or not?

672
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,682
I need you to make Alice
a zombie again.

673
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,388
Okay. I'll do the make-up.

674
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,311
Oven

675
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,314
The cables are gone-
All the poles are empty.

676
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:13,443
Same thing over here in Rose Hill.
Somebody took the damn wires down.

677
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:15,119
Holy shit!

678
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,622
Hey, Rooney,
you got anything in Lillian?

679
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,199
Hey, Rooney, you copy?

680
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,291
We got a half mile of copper missing.

681
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,331
Lines are back up at M-38.

682
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:27,586
Truck 14, Rooney's out at the junkyard.
I 'll give you an update when I hear back.

683
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,914
I wanna know who took them.

684
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:44,041
Twenty microwaves

685
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,544
gone from my inventory.

686
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,837
Everywhere you look,
things are going missing.

687
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,629
We've got trains crashing,
people vanishing.

688
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,835
Belmont County's without power.

689
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:57,505
You know what this feels like to me?
This feels like a Russian invasion.

690
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:01,972
Debbie, I don't think that the Russians
have anything to do

691
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:03,678
with what's going on in town.

692
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,934
But I am calling the curfew because
of these exact concerns.

693
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,607
Unless you can tell me who's been
messing around with our stuff,

694
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:10,185
I say it's the Soviets.

695
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:14,314
I like you, Jack,
but we need Sheriff Pruitt back.

696
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:17,529
We've got good people working on that.

697
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,276
Mr. McCandless.

698
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:26,664
Since Wednesday morning,
my ham radio is a mess!

699
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,915
Some frequencies which I like to scan,

700
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,466
I'm hearing military chatter,
but it's distorted.

701
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,543
And I don't know what it is.
Have you heard that?

702
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,924
Mr. McCandless, can I have a word
with you in private, please?

703
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:40,552
It was like having my radio hijacked.

704
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:41,928
I'm sure that must be very annoying.

705
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:43,635
You don't know those frequencies
offhand, do you?

706
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:45,891
Sure I do. 13-2-0-1...

707
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,602
Patty, why don't you get
in touch with Vicky.

708
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:49,898
Hey, Dave, you seen Milner?

709
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,066
No, sir. I haven't.

710
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,485
Jack, there's a huge sinkhole
by my garage!

711
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,732
- It sunk almost a foot!
- I'll take care of that.

712
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,655
Hey, Tom. Tom! You seen Milner?

713
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,615
Have you tried his office?

714
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,451
Have I tried his office?

715
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:02,863
What are you gonna do about the
power? It's been out for two days.

716
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:05,456
Hey, Rosko.

717
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:08,125
Rosko. I need you to get
every radio we have

718
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,201
and you tune them to those frequencies.

719
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:10,332
- Understand?
- No.

720
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:11,412
- Hey, Milner.
- Yeah.

721
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,543
Don't you have a radio scanner
with a descrambler?

722
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,124
- A voice inverter, yeah, at home.
- Whatever. Get it.

723
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,834
Bring it down here and set it up for me.
Would you please?

724
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,009
- Sure thing.
- Jack, what is this?

725
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,258
I think the Air Force is using
unassigned channels...

726
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:23,217
Hey. He was at my house
yesterday morning. You aware of that?

727
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:25,267
We brought him in for the car lot
and other stuff. He's clean.

728
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:29,189
Well, I'd appreciate it if you'd inform
your son that my house is off-limits.

729
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:31,766
And so is my daughter.

730
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,364
I think the make-up
was better yesterday.

731
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,316
No, it's good.

732
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:42,614
I think it looks good.

733
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,283
I should've cleaned up my room.

734
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,207
Did you make all these models?

735
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:57,796
Yeah. That one is
the Hunchback of Notre Dame.

736
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,670
We watched that one on TV.

737
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:10,896
This is the train they want to destroy.

738
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,023
Looks real.

739
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,981
It looks so old.

740
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,396
Yeah, that's dry brush technique.

741
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:23,655
It's when there's a coat of paint
and then you put something

742
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,611
like Euro Gray over it.

743
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,079
Euro Gray?

744
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:30,784
Oh, my God, there's like
14 different grays. It gets crazy.

745
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,000
What was that necklace?

746
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,086
The one you were holding
at the train crash.

747
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,216
Was it your mom's?

748
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:49,097
My dad gave it to her the day I was born.

749
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:51,471
She wears it all the time.

750
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,681
Well, used to.

751
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,057
And...

752
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,855
It was bad how she died and...

753
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,069
But my dad got it back.

754
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,363
Guys, what the hell?
No one knew where you were!

755
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:10,744
We're here.

756
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:13,368
- You got to play the soldier.
- I thought you were calling Evan.

757
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,210
Evan blew us off. He's a pussy!

758
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,293
Excuse me.

759
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,464
It's okay.

760
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,338
You got to do it. You're the only one.

761
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,294
Well, what the hell you mean they found
my dog in Brookville?

762
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,674
That's another county over!

763
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,840
Lucy. That's where she is.
I mean, we've got nearly 30 calls

764
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,175
from people who found local dogs,

765
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:31,602
but the thing is
the calls coming in aren't local.

766
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:37,643
It's like they all just ran away
in every direction.

767
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,729
This isn't like her,
she just doesn't disappear.

768
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:43,151
Okay, okay, calm down.
Just tell me what she looks like.

769
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,733
She's got dark hair. It was in rollers.
Do you know what rollers are?

770
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:47,656
- Yes, I know what rollers are.
- Okay, so...

771
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:48,861
Hang on.

772
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,414
Negative, unable to recover data.

773
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:53,995
That's definitely Air Force.

774
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,663
Yeah, it's Air Force,
but what does it mean?

775
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:58,166
What are they doing transmitting
on these frequencies?

776
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,839
- Maybe it's not even Air Force.
- I bet you five bucks it's Air Force.

777
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:02,167
- Five bucks?
- Yeah.

778
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:05,423
We're gonna need units to prepare for
Operation Walking Distance.

779
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,096
What did he say? "Operation" what?

780
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,756
"Walking Distance."

781
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:10,679
What's this?

782
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,726
He worked at Romero Chemical.

783
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,769
Found out some things
the company was doing.

784
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:18,274
And after what you told me last night
at the bar, I thought you should know.

785
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,526
Are we gonna get in trouble
for being here?

786
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:22,774
Production value.

787
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,527
Stop talking about production value.
I think the Air Force is gonna kill us.

788
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:27,404
- Cary.
- Don't cover my mouth!

789
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:30,407
We just made this discovery today.
You understand this is top secret?

790
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:31,533
Of course.

791
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,410
I would never have given you
this information

792
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:35,116
unless we had worked
together in Vietnam.

793
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,501
- Those were hard times.
- I'd rather not talk about it.

794
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:38,661
Understood.

795
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:41,001
- You're a good friend.
- You, too.

796
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,507
Nothing so far.

797
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:46,802
- How much more is there?
- About 60 more boxes in the basement.

798
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,800
What, more tax returns?

799
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:53,305
It's here somewhere. We'll find it. If not,
Woodward will tell us where it is.

800
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:55,102
What the hell is that?

801
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,141
Joe.

802
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:03,690
Hey, Mr. Lamb.

803
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:06,276
Get in the car.

804
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:15,994
Mr. Lamb, that's your camera,
but, technically, that's my film.

805
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:23,956
What the hell?

806
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:26,341
Is it me?

807
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,044
I would like to help you out, Deputy,
I really would,

808
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,133
but we operate on
a need-to-know basis.

809
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,509
Why are your trucks sweeping the town?

810
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:32,966
We will be out of your way shortly.

811
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:36,018
All right, then I'm sure
you won't mind me contacting D.C.

812
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,228
Talk to some friends about
"Walking Distance."

813
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:43,021
All right, we'll do it that way.

814
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,191
Deputy! Let's talk.

815
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,030
Just not here.

816
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:00,831
This is new, all of this,
for the both of us.

817
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:04,122
Dealing with anything. Just us.

818
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,834
So, I'm gonna make this
as simple and as clear as I can.

819
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,835
You're not friends with Alice Dainard.

820
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:14,345
When I say "No," I don't mean "Maybe."
I don't mean "Yes."

821
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,015
I mean "No."

822
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:20,183
I've known Louis Dainard for a lot
of years. He's been nothing but trouble.

823
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:23,019
Your mother used to say he's
not such a bad guy.

824
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,066
He just needs a chance,
that he was sad.

825
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,734
Well, I tried to be good to him.

826
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,729
And I can't, not any more.

827
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:32,942
I will not allow him
or his daughter in this house.

828
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:35,153
I will not allow you to
spend time with her,

829
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:38,205
doing projects or whatever it is
that you do. That's it.

830
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,953
I hope we're clear on that.

831
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:43,919
We're not clear.

832
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:46,004
What'd you say?

833
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,081
We're not clear.

834
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,384
You and I aren't clear about anything.
We couldn't be less clear.

835
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:54,756
Just because Mom died doesn't mean
you know anything about me. You don't.

836
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,846
You don't know anything about
Alice, either. She's kind.

837
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:59,051
We're not gonna have this discussion
right now.

838
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,307
- She's nice to me!
- I don't care what she is!

839
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,479
Her father is an irresponsible,
selfish son of a bitch.

840
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,103
You listen to me.
I've got 12,000 people in this town

841
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:12,861
who are scared out of their mind.
They've got one person to rely on.

842
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:15,701
It used to be someone else,
but now it's just me.

843
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,461
Move, move!

844
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:58,670
Let's go. Move!

845
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:01,473
Deputy, drop your weapons.
Put your hands on the car

846
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,925
I'm here to see Colonel Nelec!

847
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,052
He told me to meet him here.

848
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:07,392
You're under military arrest.
Drop your weapons.

849
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:09,390
Where's Nelec?

850
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,186
I don't want any more trouble, do you?

851
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:21,368
We've been going through your
belongings, looking for evidence.

852
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:25,368
What you knew. How you knew it.
Who else might know.

853
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,083
I remember you in the lab.

854
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,293
And I recall we didn't always see
eye to eye,

855
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:41,096
but that is no excuse
for doing what you did here.

856
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:46,059
So, in the spirit of moving forward
and avoiding more trouble,

857
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,762
why don't you just tell me
where you put your research

858
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:50,189
and who else knows about it.

859
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:53,567
I know you had someone document
the crash that night.

860
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,773
Tell me who that was
and I will help you.

861
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:57,897
I swear to God on my mother's life,

862
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,950
if you help us now,
we will take care of you.

863
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,989
I've seen what happens, Mr. Nelec,

864
00:56:07,823 --> 00:56:10,121
- when you take care of people.
- It is mine.

865
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,702
He is mine.

866
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,750
I'm gonna bait him and catch him.

867
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,962
He's in me, you know.

868
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,300
As I am in him.

869
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,388
So,

870
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:27,476
when you see him next,

871
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:30,554
as I'm sure you will,

872
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:33,478
I'll be watching you, too.

873
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,404
Are you... Were you sleeping?

874
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:23,524
Before. Earlier. No.

875
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,572
Are you okay?

876
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:28,199
Yeah, I'm fine.

877
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,281
You want to come in?

878
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:32,537
Yeah.

879
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:41,549
Power's still out.

880
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,129
Room's still messy.

881
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:46,555
I couldn't sleep.

882
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:48,969
I was thinking.

883
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,061
I wanted to tell you something
before tomorrow.

884
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:56,848
Don't let Charles blow up your train.

885
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:00,777
I don't think it's right.

886
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,865
I know he's your friend.
He's so bossy.

887
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,784
But I've known him since kindergarten.
He's really nice.

888
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,487
He shouldn't always get what he wants.

889
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,282
I mean, who always gets
what they want?

890
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,087
I know I don't know you at all.

891
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:22,423
Even though it sort of feels like I do.

892
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:30,554
Do you not feel like that?

893
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,722
No. No, I totally do.

894
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:36,514
I'm just kind of in shock
at this entire conversation.

895
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,859
Power's back.

896
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,562
No, no. Keep it.

897
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,320
It's... it's so weird.

898
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:34,363
Watching her like this.
Like she's still here.

899
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:44,670
She used to look at me this way,
like really look,

900
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:52,473
and I just knew I was there,
that I existed.

901
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,863
He drank that morning.

902
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,365
My dad.

903
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,659
He missed his shift.

904
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:28,500
Your mom took it for him,

905
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,589
the day of the accident.

906
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,066
He...

907
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,118
He...

908
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,363
He... He wishes...

909
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:02,959
I know he wishes it was him
instead of her.

910
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:10,091
And sometimes I do, too.

911
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,180
Don't say that.

912
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,218
He's your dad.

913
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,288
Is... Is this normal?

914
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,996
No. This is new.

915
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,766
Want to tell me where you were?

916
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,225
Or should I tell you?

917
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:55,696
Sit down.

918
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,195
I should go to bed.

919
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,201
I want to talk to you. I said sit down.

920
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:01,824
I don't want to sit down!

921
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:04,949
Then go.

922
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:08,368
Be just like your mother and leave.

923
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:11,208
Dad...

924
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:12,922
Go ahead! Go!

925
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,042
Go!

926
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:23,717
Alice!

927
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:25,306
Alice!

928
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:26,849
Alice!

929
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:28,972
Wait!

930
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:54,123
Ally, I'm sorry!

931
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:25,950
Alice!

932
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:29,245
Ally!

933
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:34,959
Alice!

934
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:36,414
Ally!

935
01:04:45,757 --> 01:04:46,849
Ally!

936
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:53,432
Firelight at 0500 hours.

937
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:56,309
Operation Walking Distance is in effect.

938
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:59,237
T-minus four hours to evacuation.

939
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:01,940
Evacuation in T-minus four hours.

940
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:05,243
Why are you not reacting?
That thing went through my wall!

941
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:06,615
I told you not to pick it up
in the first place.

942
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:09,243
What are you so angry about? That I'm
not gonna let you blow up my train?

943
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:11,745
That's part of it. Just a part.

944
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:16,292
Hey. Tell your sister that Donny
from Olsen's broke up with Karen.

945
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:19,086
That shit ended about a week ago.

946
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:22,419
What's your problem?

947
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:24,971
My whole movie's a disaster
because of you.

948
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:27,890
- I know my dad's being a turkey.
- Whatever.

949
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:31,849
- We're still gonna finish your movie.
- It's not about the movie.

950
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,521
What are you talking about?
Of course it is!

951
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:34,848
Just forget it.

952
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:38,481
Why? There's nothing wrong!
We're gonna finish the movie!

953
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,289
I can get the camera back.
I know where my dad put it.

954
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,915
We can still make the festival.

955
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:58,963
- It's not about the movie.
- Then what is it about?

956
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:01,132
Jesus, you don't get it, do you?
It's obvious.

957
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,130
- What's obvious?
- God, you're a dumbass.

958
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,211
That night of the crash,
you started getting all weird.

959
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:08,014
- What? What are you talking about?
- Like Mr. Attitude, all of a sudden.

960
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,968
Your movie was over!
That's what you said! You were upset!

961
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,927
- Oh, my God.
- I gave you a camera! I helped you!

962
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:14,479
Don't pretend like you did this for me.

963
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:16,056
You didn't do this for me,
and you know it.

964
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:20,018
This was never about me.
This was always about Alice!

965
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:21,227
Action!

966
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,029
I'm going to stay here and investigate.

967
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:26,324
I think it's safer
if you leave town for a couple of days.

968
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:29,369
John, I don't like it.
This case- These murders.

969
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:30,661
Well, what am I supposed to do...

970
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:32,535
Well, you're the one
who wanted the wife in the movie.

971
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:33,911
Not so you could fall in love with her.

972
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,163
What do you care
what I think about Alice anyway?

973
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,835
Because I like her!

974
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,879
That's why I asked her to do this thing
in the first place,

975
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,548
so I could get to know her. Not you!

976
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,674
- You like Alice Dainard?
- You're such an idiot!

977
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:48,630
- Watch out!
- Joe, what the hell are you...

978
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,681
- Oh, my God! Shit!
- Run!

979
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:56,896
Shit. Look at all that smoke.
I can't use this.

980
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:01,313
You won't even let me
blow up your train.

981
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:04,108
Everything's bogus.

982
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:11,240
We could make another train
and blow that one up.

983
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,917
I do like her.

984
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,457
- Sorry about that.
- Shut up.

985
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,047
It's okay.

986
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:25,966
That's not even what bothers me.

987
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,008
She likes you, too.

988
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:33,258
That's what really bothers me.

989
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:37,559
I know it sounds stupid.
Why would she ever like me?

990
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:41,434
I haven't leaned out yet
and the doctor says it's gonna happen.

991
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:46,397
I don't know. Everything's just so bogus.

992
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:48,030
Charles.

993
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,658
Joe, what the hell?

994
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:01,419
What is that?

995
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:03,497
What is that?

996
01:08:21,139 --> 01:08:24,609
- Mr. Harkin! What's going on?
- Evacuation! The fire!

997
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:29,480
Wait, wait!

998
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:40,538
The county is being evacuated due to
a wildfire that is raging out of control,

999
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:43,917
and threatening to reach
the Lillian chemical plant.

1000
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:48,291
Please take with you
essential items only.

1001
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:50,092
If you are driving your own vehicle,

1002
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:53,092
follow the Cara van
to the evacuation center:

1003
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:55,222
Please remain calm.

1004
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:27,497
File in.

1005
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:29,586
File in, please, file in.

1006
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:33,086
- Corporal.
- I left the medication my wife needs.

1007
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:36,469
Sir, the town is sealed off.
No one's allowed in.

1008
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:38,595
- H through N.
- I can't get it anywhere else.

1009
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:40,017
Charles!

1010
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:41,598
Excuse me.

1011
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:44,272
Charles, oh, thank God.

1012
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,270
I went back to the house
and you were gone.

1013
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:48,067
Yeah, they put us on the bus.

1014
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,645
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey. I'm gonna find my dad.

1015
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:52,730
- You gonna tell him about that huge...
- Yes.

1016
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:54,441
Come back if you can't find him!

1017
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,461
Mr. Dainard, it's Joe Lamb.

1018
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:10,666
I know you don't like me and I'm sorry
about that, but I'm looking for my dad.

1019
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,126
It took her.

1020
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:16,050
- It took Alice.
- What?

1021
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:18,138
I saw it. It was big.

1022
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:21,514
And, I don't know, it was something

1023
01:10:22,552 --> 01:10:24,850
I've never... I've never...

1024
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:27,978
No one believes me.
They just keep giving me pills and...

1025
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,484
No one believes me.

1026
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:32,604
I believe you.

1027
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:38,776
That thing took her?

1028
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:41,739
We have to go back to town
to find Alice, to find her. Come on, guys.

1029
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:43,915
- Dude, she's dead. Alice is dead...
- Don't say that!

1030
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,958
First of all, I want to live. Okay?

1031
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:47,785
Joe, what do you actually
expect to do, man?

1032
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:49,997
The town's closed.
We're not allowed to go back.

1033
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,047
Look, I have an idea.
I'm going whether or not you come,

1034
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:53,966
which I really hope you do.
Come on, guys.

1035
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:55,668
I have six tons of explosives
in this thing.

1036
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:57,595
Let's find that thing and blow it to shit!

1037
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,217
As if I'm gonna help you.

1038
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:01,595
Do this for me,
I'll babysit the twins next week,

1039
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:03,347
so you can go to Wendy's stupid party.

1040
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:05,182
I'm not shitting you.

1041
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,808
You can't ask me any questions, though,

1042
01:11:06,888 --> 01:11:09,141
and you can't tell anyone.
I'm serious. Nobody.

1043
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:11,146
Does it have to be him?

1044
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,819
Yes or no, you ugly freak!
I'm about to rescind the offer.

1045
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:19,284
This whole evacuation thing's
really freaking me out.

1046
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:21,326
Making me rethink my priorities.

1047
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:25,832
Saw you over here
and thought maybe we could kick back.

1048
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:28,455
We... We totally could.

1049
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:32,289
I asked Charles about you
and he said you're a great guy.

1050
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,211
I totally am.

1051
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:38,545
Will you hate me if I start
our relationship by asking a favor?

1052
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:41,593
So, there are rules
to being in my car, okay?

1053
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:43,140
Where the hell are we going, anyway?

1054
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:44,638
We're going to go to the school
and open the trailer

1055
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:47,391
Woodward has in the parking lot.
I bet that...

1056
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:50,311
I bet that's where
he's keeping his research.

1057
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:51,732
Research. What research?

1058
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:53,484
We're gonna learn everything we can
about that thing,

1059
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:56,028
so that we can find it
and that's how we're gonna save Alice.

1060
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:57,229
Come on. Let's go!

1061
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:00,988
Dorks, no shoes on my upholstery.
And no one touches my C.B.

1062
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,114
- You got it?
- The dungeon? Are you serious?

1063
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:04,287
Why else are there six padlocks
on the door?

1064
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:06,330
We're going to the school.

1065
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,078
Since when did this one
become so bossy?

1066
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:09,409
I don't know.

1067
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:14,918
I got to take a leak! What am
I supposed to do, piss in here?

1068
01:12:22,547 --> 01:12:24,140
Thanks for the hospitality.

1069
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:31,602
Am I gonna go in alone,
or are you gonna end up coming with...

1070
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:18,568
driving your own vehicle,

1071
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:21,614
follow the Cara van
to the evacuation center:

1072
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:33,034
If the Air Force has already searched
Woodward's house,

1073
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:35,245
wouldn't they have searched
stuff in the schoolroom, too?

1074
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:36,420
Yeah, man, I was just thinking
about that, too.

1075
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:38,748
Maybe his room, but not the dungeon.

1076
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:40,750
Woodward keeps all kinds
of weird stuff in the dungeon.

1077
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,127
Shut up!

1078
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,670
So, what kind of music does she like,
your sister?

1079
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:47,882
I don't care. Disco, I guess.

1080
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:50,268
I can get back into disco.

1081
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:52,887
We shouldn't take River Road,
they put a roadblock up.

1082
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:55,769
Dork, I saw it. Observe.

1083
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,278
So, what, I just wait here like a douche?

1084
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:12,832
Yes. Thank you so much for doing this.
Do you have a tire iron?

1085
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:25,382
Joe, let me try! Joe, let me try!

1086
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:27,843
God, I hope my Electronic Football
is in there.

1087
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:32,643
Joe, this is impossible, man.
There's no way we can do this.

1088
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:34,891
These things are made like
a bank vault, like a safe.

1089
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:38,020
Professional robbers can't even get in
through these things. They're so...

1090
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:40,184
Shit!

1091
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:42,148
I loosened it for you.

1092
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:47,237
- Guys.
- Look at all this junk!

1093
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:48,533
He's got movies in here.

1094
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:51,032
I can't believe
we're breaking into the school!

1095
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:54,332
Who does that? Nobody does that!
Idiots do that!

1096
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,630
Dr. Woodward was dishonorably
discharged from Nellie Air Force Base

1097
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:06,837
in 1963 because of
"subversive conduct," whatever that is.

1098
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:09,263
Charles, check it out.
It's Old Man Woodward.

1099
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:12,967
Back when he was like
Middle-Aged Man Woodward.

1100
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:17,104
He's been tracking this thing
since 1958.

1101
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:20,566
What is this?

1102
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:24,820
It says, "April 8th, 1963 incident."

1103
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:26,529
I don't know.

1104
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:32,535
- Cary!
- What?

1105
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:34,409
We have to find this thing. Come on!

1106
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:35,831
Okay. Sorry.

1107
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:42,752
Told them that this creature
is more sophisticated than any of us,

1108
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:48,386
that his species
is predominantly subterranean.

1109
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,011
- Subterranean.
- And that he is being treated

1110
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:52,636
without compassion or respect.

1111
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:58,187
I explained that all he wants
is to rebuild his ship,

1112
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:02,688
a craft made up of those cubes,
a complex shape-shifting alloy.

1113
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:06,772
Remarkable material
that we'll never fully understand.

1114
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:13,654
He has been desperate to reconstitute
his ship since it crashed here in '58...

1115
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:18,791
But instead of giving him the help
he needs, we've held him as a prisoner

1116
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:20,626
- Guys, it's Dr. Woodward!
- He's been restrained

1117
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:24,376
and experimented upon,
biopsied, and tortured by Nelec.

1118
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:29,168
Through pain and lack of compassion,
we have taught him to hate us all.

1119
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:32,380
We have turned him into an enemy.

1120
01:16:32,463 --> 01:16:36,593
I told them I knew these things
because he made Contact with me,

1121
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:39,724
that he makes a psychic connection
by touch.

1122
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:42,265
Oh, my God!

1123
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:44,271
- What is that thing?
- What the hell?

1124
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:46,193
- I can't watch this.
- Martin, you're gonna throw up, man.

1125
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:50,273
The moment we made contact,
I understood him, and he me.

1126
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:56,287
What I know is that if we don't change
this and begin helping him,

1127
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:00,199
we will all pay the price.

1128
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:03,248
But Nelec won't listen.

1129
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:05,295
He wasn't trying to kill it.

1130
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:07,419
He 'll have me discharged.

1131
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:08,920
He was trying to help it escape.

1132
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:10,125
But I won't give up.

1133
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:13,296
I will do everything in my power

1134
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:14,551
- to set him free.
- Oh, my God.

1135
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:18,180
- You guys hear that?
- Help him rebuild that ship. I won't.-.

1136
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,057
Freeze! Nobody move!

1137
01:17:25,683 --> 01:17:27,060
Do not move!

1138
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:40,702
We got positive I.D. here.
It's just a bunch of kids.

1139
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:41,907
Oh, Shit.

1140
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:46,332
Search them.

1141
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:48,547
Let me see that.

1142
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:52,965
I rolled those M-80s myself.

1143
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:55,968
- That's right.
- Jesus, Cary, shut up.

1144
01:17:58,090 --> 01:17:59,467
You're the Deputy's boy.

1145
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:04,351
No.

1146
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,350
Move out!

1147
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:23,658
Oh, Shit. Oh, Shit. Oh, Shit. Oh, Shit.

1148
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:30,293
Breaker, breaker.
Requesting police backup.

1149
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:33,667
Breaker 1-9. Is this the police channel?

1150
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:41,683
- Staff Sergeant.
- Hi. How are you doing?

1151
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:45,638
Hey, Mr. Lamb!

1152
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:47,394
Rosko.

1153
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:50,271
Hey. Where the hell have you been?

1154
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:52,479
- What are you wearing?
- Come here.

1155
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:55,690
The Air Force set that fire. They want
the town empty for some reason.

1156
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:57,195
This whole operation,
this whole military operation,

1157
01:18:57,274 --> 01:18:59,072
the evacuation, everything, it's all bad.

1158
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:00,994
- We need to find...
- Did you hear about Joe?

1159
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:05,333
Look, dispatch just got
a call on citizens' band.

1160
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:06,829
Joe and some of his friends,

1161
01:19:06,951 --> 01:19:10,706
they were grabbed by military personnel
at the middle school.

1162
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:17,838
Preston, you tell me everything,
and I won't throw you in jail.

1163
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:22,475
Yes, sir.
But I think you should look at this first.

1164
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:29,273
Chief Master Sergeant,
Dustoff-03 is 20 minutes out.

1165
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:33,478
Roger that. Perimeter secure. Standing
by on lookout. Prepare to engage.

1166
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:36,154
Teams Kilo-Lima-Mike-November
in position.

1167
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:39,234
Teams Oscar-Foxtrot-Quebec-Romeo
in position.

1168
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:42,240
Cocked and locked. Ready to go.

1169
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:48,501
What's going to happen to us?

1170
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:51,124
I think we're gonna die.

1171
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:54,298
Cary, shut up, man.
They wouldn't do that.

1172
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:56,967
I'm not kidding.
I think they're gonna kill us.

1173
01:19:57,668 --> 01:20:00,968
They're not gonna kill us.
You know why?

1174
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:02,389
- Why?
- Because we're just...

1175
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:05,805
Hold on!

1176
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,313
Hold on!

1177
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:19,986
Was that that thing from the train?

1178
01:20:24,778 --> 01:20:26,246
Why are we stopping?

1179
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:27,665
- Why are we stopped?
- Holy shit!

1181
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:31,125
Currently heading towards...

1182
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:34,876
- Driver! Can you see anything up there?
- No, sir! Nothing.

1183
01:20:35,956 --> 01:20:37,583
What's that gun?

1184
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:40,969
Sako Bolt Action thirty-aught six with...

1185
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:42,171
Okay, we get it.

1186
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:44,723
Those aren't bullets.
He's loading tracking darts.

1187
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:46,926
Here. Tag it.

1188
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:53,936
Yes, Sir.

1189
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:56,230
Open the door!

1190
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:23,304
I don't feel good about this.

1191
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:31,641
Sir, is there a particular area
that you'd want me to shoot...

1192
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:41,238
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1193
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:42,906
Help!

1194
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:48,537
Oh, my God!

1195
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:49,784
Get us out of here now!

1196
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:51,574
What other firepower do we have?

1197
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:55,082
- There's a monster out there, Joe!
- What the hell is it?

1198
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:03,169
I got it, sir!

1199
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:18,939
- Guys, the seat belt is killing me!
- Unhook it!

1200
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:20,269
Come on!

1201
01:22:20,644 --> 01:22:21,861
Come on!

1202
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:37,411
This is Nelec. Use the big guns.

1203
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:40,373
Whatever happens to me,
do not let it...

1204
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:43,959
- Joe, open it!
- Open the door!

1205
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:47,046
- It's bolted!
- I want to go home so bad!

1206
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:48,597
Open the door.

1207
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:50,891
- Please, sir.
- Just let us out!

1208
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:53,184
Please open it!

1209
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,386
Where are the keys?

1210
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:56,309
Overmyer had them!

1211
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:58,607
Help me! My leg's stuck!

1212
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:00,229
Please, sir, open the door!

1213
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:01,731
Please, open the door!

1214
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:07,862
Another one dead!

1215
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:11,786
Guys, there's broken glass.

1216
01:23:11,904 --> 01:23:13,030
Guys!

1217
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:15,332
Martin! Martin!
Let me get on your shoulders. Come on.

1218
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:16,499
Go, go, get up!

1219
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:17,997
- Here we go.
- Go!

1220
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:20,170
- Come on, Joe! You can do it!
- Come on, Joe!

1221
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:22,373
- You can do it, Joe! Let's go.
- Come on!

1222
01:23:22,456 --> 01:23:23,878
- Come on!
- You can do it! Come on!

1223
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:32,974
Joe, please! Go!

1224
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:36,307
- Come on. Break the glass, you pussy!
- Come on, Joe! Hit it! Come on!

1225
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:49,445
We got to go!

1226
01:23:56,073 --> 01:23:58,292
- Go!
- Come on, guys, hurry!

1227
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:36,743
Come with us. We got some questions
for you. Come on.

1228
01:24:36,822 --> 01:24:38,199
- Oh, no. Is she dead?
- Just come with us.

1229
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:40,751
Hey, fellows,
I've got orders from Colonel Nelec

1230
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:42,328
to personally deliver this man
back to base.

1231
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:45,210
- He's all yours, Staff Sergeant.
- Let's go.

1232
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:48,042
What are you doing?
Where are we going?

1233
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:49,968
To find our kids.

1234
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:56,676
Hey, guys! Guys, I found them!

1235
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:01,101
Hey, guys! I found my firecrackers!

1236
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:02,180
Congratulations.

1237
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:06,394
Let's go, guys, they're coming back.
I think we should go. Come on.

1238
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:08,733
Guys, come on.

1239
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:11,198
No. No, look.

1240
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:18,037
You dorks are alive? I thought that...

1241
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:21,742
What the fuck?

1242
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:22,997
Donny. Donny.

1243
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:24,623
We need a ride into town.

1244
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:28,424
Okay, but just so you know,
I'm massively stoned right now.

1245
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:31,009
Do you want me to drive?

1246
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:36,841
- Guys, what was that?
- It sounds like gunshots.

1247
01:25:36,923 --> 01:25:39,301
- Joe, where are we going?
- I saw something in the cemetery.

1248
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:42,433
Woodward said it was subterranean.
I think I know where it is.

1249
01:25:42,512 --> 01:25:45,231
What the hell is that?
Move the damn car!

1250
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:54,157
- God!
- Joe, turn the car around!

1251
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:55,484
- I can't. There's a tank behind us.
- Holy shit!

1252
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:57,035
- What are they shooting at?
- Guys, we have to run.

1253
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:58,908
Donny! Hey, Donny, wake up!

1254
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:01,831
- He's too stoned!
- Drugs are so bad!

1255
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:10,753
- Why is everyone firing?
- We gotta go!

1256
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:13,085
Guys, come on, hurry!

1257
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:15,921
- This is crazy!
- What is going on?

1258
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:18,431
Look! It just exploded!

1259
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:22,182
Sir! The weapons are misfiring!
All of them!

1260
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:25,730
Surface-to-air! Radar!
It's a mess out here, sir!

1261
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:29,856
Guys! Guys, run!

1262
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:31,354
Come on!

1263
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:33,314
What the hell is this?

1264
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,198
Go, Cary, go!

1265
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:39,156
- Jesus!
- Go!

1266
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:45,792
What the hell?
Holy shit!

1267
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:57,759
Why is everyone firing?

1268
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:02,300
Go, come on!
Move ahead!

1269
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:06,847
Oh, my God!

1270
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:16,239
Come on, guys, move!

1271
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:19,238
Did you guys see those explosions?
They were... They were huge!

1272
01:27:19,985 --> 01:27:21,362
Oh, my God.

1273
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:24,747
Whose house is this?

1274
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:27,201
It's Kathy's. I got it off the fridge.

1275
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:29,412
Kathy? Yeah, I know her.

1276
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:32,290
Charles, what are you thinking, dude?
That's not yours!

1277
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:34,420
What, I'm thirsty. I'm in a war zone!

1278
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:35,921
- Clear! Clear!
- Come on, move!

1279
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:37,719
Let's go, move out!

1280
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:40,088
- Guys, come on, let's go.
- Where are we going?

1281
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:41,549
To the cemetery. I'm...

1282
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:49,731
Guys, what happened to my leg?
Man, it hurts!

1283
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:54,524
Holy shit, Martin, you've got
a bone sticking out of your leg!

1284
01:27:55,896 --> 01:27:58,115
Joe, give me that thing off the curtains!

1285
01:27:58,190 --> 01:27:59,362
God!

1286
01:28:00,442 --> 01:28:03,366
I've got to go find Alice.
You guys stay here with Martin.

1287
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:05,577
You gonna be okay without me?

1288
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:07,456
Yeah.

1289
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,625
- I'm not staying with the girls!
- God, Cary! Shut up!

1290
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:13,705
- Calm down!
- Come on! Come on!

1291
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:15,041
It hurts, Joe!

1292
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:17,546
Okay, this is going to hurt
really bad, okay?

1293
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:20,512
Jesus, Martin, I haven't done it yet!

1294
01:28:31,765 --> 01:28:32,982
Just... Just follow me. Just follow me.

1295
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:36,278
I've been following you for the last five
blocks! What are we doing here?

1296
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:38,572
Come on, through these doors.
Help me.

1297
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:41,651
- Help you with what?
- We have to get inside.

1298
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:43,531
Okay, okay. For what?

1299
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:45,821
I'll tell you in a second.

1300
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:48,032
Why is there dirt in these windows?

1301
01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:53,329
It's here. Hard on three.
One, two, three.

1302
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:55,209
One, two, three!

1303
01:28:55,288 --> 01:28:58,087
- One, two, three! One, two, three!
- One, two, three! One, two, three!

1304
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:10,436
This... This is scary.

1305
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:12,268
You got any sparklers in there?

1306
01:29:13,515 --> 01:29:14,516
Are you kidding me?

1307
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:28,114
Alice is down there.

1308
01:29:43,753 --> 01:29:45,926
I came to your house that day

1309
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:50,348
to tell you that
I never meant to hurt anyone.

1310
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:54,063
I swear to God.

1311
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:58,818
I'm sorry, Jack.

1312
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:03,110
About what happened to your wife.

1313
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:13,666
It was an accident.

1314
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:22,751
It was an accident.

1315
01:30:41,937 --> 01:30:43,735
Joe, I don't understand...

1316
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:48,405
This way.

1317
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:59,706
Why are you so surprised?
I always wear lipstick on my shirt.

1318
01:31:44,874 --> 01:31:46,376
- It's Sheriff Pruitt!
- I know.

1319
01:31:46,793 --> 01:31:48,170
Cary, look.

1320
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:52,883
There are bodies everywhere.

1321
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:56,186
- What is this?
- We're under the water tower. Look.

1322
01:32:04,894 --> 01:32:07,613
She's got to be here.
She's got to be here.

1323
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:22,495
It's eating a person.

1324
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,092
She's here.

1325
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:30,128
Oh, my God. I see her.

1326
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:33,139
Okay.
We're going to use your firecrackers

1327
01:32:34,049 --> 01:32:36,177
I don't think that's gonna hurt him, Joe.

1328
01:32:36,259 --> 01:32:38,853
- There's other tunnels.
- So?

1329
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:41,647
I need you to make noise
right here in two minutes.

1330
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:44,943
Make it loud and make it last.
Give me some sparklers.

1331
01:32:45,018 --> 01:32:49,364
Make sure you're gone when it blows.
You can't be here. You got to run.

1332
01:32:50,607 --> 01:32:52,359
Where are you going?

1333
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:28,357
Come on, Cary.

1334
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:17,698
Alice. Alice. Please, we have to go.
Come on.

1335
01:34:17,777 --> 01:34:19,745
Alice! Alice!

1336
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:23,124
Please, come on.
We have to go. Alice!

1337
01:34:30,123 --> 01:34:31,966
You're alive! You're alive.

1338
01:34:32,584 --> 01:34:35,258
You're alive. Are you okay?
Can you hear me?

1339
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:38,340
What is this? What are you doing here?

1340
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:40,141
I'm just doing the best I can to save you.

1341
01:34:50,185 --> 01:34:51,858
How did you know?

1342
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:55,695
Your dad. He told me. He was worried.

1343
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:57,400
And flipping out.

1344
01:34:58,026 --> 01:34:59,494
- Really?
- We have to move.

1345
01:34:59,986 --> 01:35:01,329
Excuse me?

1346
01:35:03,656 --> 01:35:05,124
Where are we?

1347
01:35:06,075 --> 01:35:07,122
I left my bag in the car,

1348
01:35:07,202 --> 01:35:09,125
and then I went out to the car
to get my bag...

1349
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:10,672
It's been locked up for years.

1350
01:35:10,747 --> 01:35:13,626
It's terrified and hungry
and it just wants to go home.

1351
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:14,709
When it touched me, I knew.

1352
01:35:14,792 --> 01:35:17,466
I need you to help me
get the Sheriff down.

1353
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:30,353
Follow me this way.
I'll get us out of here.

1354
01:35:30,433 --> 01:35:32,481
- Sheriff, we came that way.
- Don't argue with me! Just follow me!

1355
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,028
Come on, kids, let's go with the Sheriff.

1356
01:35:45,865 --> 01:35:47,162
This way.

1357
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:50,335
Joe!

1358
01:35:52,455 --> 01:35:53,752
I told you to get out!
What are you doing here?

1359
01:35:53,831 --> 01:35:56,630
I thought this was the way out.
Okay, I tried.

1360
01:35:56,709 --> 01:35:58,336
- Hey, Alice, welcome back.
- Hey!

1361
01:35:58,419 --> 01:36:00,171
Come on! We got to get out of here...

1362
01:36:02,632 --> 01:36:03,679
Guys, hurry!

1363
01:36:07,303 --> 01:36:08,520
Come on, go!

1364
01:36:12,684 --> 01:36:15,858
She's gone! It took her!
I don't want to be next!

1365
01:36:37,959 --> 01:36:42,135
- Go! You don't want to be here! Go!
- Joe, what are you doing?

1366
01:36:50,305 --> 01:36:52,148
Ally, what the hell is he doing?

1367
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:53,725
We understand!

1368
01:36:57,562 --> 01:36:58,779
But not everyone's horrible.

1369
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:01,778
- No!
- Joe!

1370
01:37:03,526 --> 01:37:04,994
Let him down!

1371
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:17,081
I know bad things happen.

1372
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:21,257
Bad things happen.

1373
01:37:25,173 --> 01:37:27,096
But you can still live.

1374
01:37:31,554 --> 01:37:32,897
You can still live.

1375
01:38:15,515 --> 01:38:17,313
Okay, wait a minute.

1376
01:38:17,642 --> 01:38:18,814
What?

1377
01:39:06,399 --> 01:39:08,276
- Look out!
- Get down! Get down!

1378
01:39:46,105 --> 01:39:47,573
What is he doing?

1379
01:39:48,733 --> 01:39:50,531
He's making a model.

1380
01:40:35,404 --> 01:40:36,747
I got you.

1381
01:40:38,616 --> 01:40:39,959
I got you.

1382
01:42:28,059 --> 01:42:29,982
Holy shit!

1383
01:44:24,592 --> 01:44:26,265
This is where my friend was attacked.

1384
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:28,471
- By who?
- I've never seen him before.

1385
01:44:28,763 --> 01:44:32,063
He looked pale, crazy. He bit my friend.

1386
01:44:32,141 --> 01:44:33,563
- Then what happened?
- He was dead.

1387
01:44:33,642 --> 01:44:35,440
- And then...
- He got up and walked away?

1388
01:44:35,519 --> 01:44:37,317
- How did you know?
- Anything left behind?

1389
01:44:37,688 --> 01:44:40,316
Yes, this fell out of the pocket
of the attacker's pocket.

1390
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:41,491
Thank you.

1391
01:44:44,403 --> 01:44:46,576
Hello, Mr. President.
I'm Detective Hathaway.

1392
01:44:46,655 --> 01:44:50,501
I'm here to discuss some urgent matters
regarding your chemical factory.

1393
01:44:50,576 --> 01:44:52,578
Are you referring
to the recent incidents?

1394
01:44:52,661 --> 01:44:53,662
Yes, I believe I am.

1395
01:44:53,746 --> 01:44:55,123
Tell the chairman I'll call him back.

1396
01:44:55,539 --> 01:44:57,166
You have three minutes.

1397
01:44:57,792 --> 01:45:00,466
You want to tell me
about those employees?

1398
01:45:00,544 --> 01:45:04,014
I was sorry to hear
of their unfortunate accident.

1399
01:45:04,089 --> 01:45:07,343
That was no accident!
Did you see the bites on their neck?

1400
01:45:07,426 --> 01:45:08,928
Are you suggesting some connection

1401
01:45:09,011 --> 01:45:12,515
between my chemical company
and those, those...

1402
01:45:12,598 --> 01:45:14,316
Those were zombie attacks!

1403
01:45:14,517 --> 01:45:17,270
Romero Chemical has nothing to do
with any such thing.

1404
01:45:17,394 --> 01:45:19,021
Then what happens in Building 47?

1405
01:45:19,522 --> 01:45:22,401
You wouldn't mind
if I took a look around, would you?

1406
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:24,947
Of course not.

1407
01:45:28,697 --> 01:45:30,324
Good day to you, Mr. President.

1408
01:45:30,407 --> 01:45:32,125
Good day, Detective.

1409
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:35,587
He knows.

1410
01:46:07,945 --> 01:46:09,993
Judith. it's me, your boss.

1411
01:46:10,072 --> 01:46:11,915
I need you to buy my wife
a ticket to Michigan.

1412
01:46:11,991 --> 01:46:15,461
It's too dangerous for her here.
I just love her so much.

1413
01:46:17,621 --> 01:46:20,374
John, I don't like it.
This case. These murders.

1414
01:46:20,457 --> 01:46:22,880
Well, what am I supposed to do,
go to Michigan with you?

1415
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:25,383
Mackinac Island's beautiful
this time of year.

1416
01:46:25,462 --> 01:46:27,305
Sweetheart, this is my job.

1417
01:46:27,423 --> 01:46:29,266
I just love you so much!

1418
01:46:29,341 --> 01:46:30,638
I love you, too.

1419
01:46:40,269 --> 01:46:42,488
I can't believe
we weren't killed last night.

1420
01:46:42,563 --> 01:46:44,736
Okay, now you have to leave town.

1421
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:46,658
No. I'm staying here with you.

1422
01:46:46,734 --> 01:46:49,112
I don't know what I would do
if something happened to you.

1423
01:46:49,194 --> 01:46:50,741
What if there are survivors down there?

1424
01:46:50,821 --> 01:46:53,449
There were no survivors!
Did you see that crash?

1425
01:46:53,532 --> 01:46:55,626
Excuse me, sir, were you in the wreck?

1426
01:47:03,167 --> 01:47:05,841
That settles it. I'm not going anywhere.

1427
01:47:08,339 --> 01:47:10,433
It's been two weeks,
and the murders continue.

1428
01:47:10,507 --> 01:47:12,259
This investigation is like no other.

1429
01:47:12,343 --> 01:47:16,189
It's putting too much stress on this town
and on my marriage.

1430
01:47:18,223 --> 01:47:20,100
Could zombies be real?

1431
01:47:22,102 --> 01:47:24,104
Hello? This is Detective Hathaway.

1432
01:47:24,188 --> 01:47:25,906
I'll be right over.

1433
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:29,113
- What's happening here?
- A military police investigation.

1434
01:47:29,193 --> 01:47:30,490
It was a suicide.

1435
01:47:30,569 --> 01:47:33,698
- A suicide? Who was it?
- A former Air Force officer.

1436
01:47:33,781 --> 01:47:36,034
Said there was a secret
he couldn't keep any longer.

1437
01:47:36,116 --> 01:47:38,084
It says he worked for Dr. Peter Braken?

1438
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:39,753
I never would have given you
this information

1439
01:47:39,828 --> 01:47:41,375
if we hadn't served together in Vietnam.

1440
01:47:41,872 --> 01:47:44,375
- Those were hard times.
- I'd rather not talk about it.

1441
01:47:47,336 --> 01:47:48,883
- Doctor.
- Detective.

1442
01:47:48,963 --> 01:47:51,091
I'm here to discuss your involvement
with Romero Chemical?

1443
01:47:51,173 --> 01:47:53,596
I was the one that developed
the special compound

1444
01:47:53,676 --> 01:47:55,474
to turn all these humans into zombies.

1445
01:47:55,552 --> 01:47:57,771
It was supposed to be used
as a military weapon,

1446
01:47:57,846 --> 01:47:59,974
but it got out of hand.
So I made this antidote

1447
01:48:00,057 --> 01:48:02,651
that will hopefully cure
all of the zombies.

1448
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:04,478
That's incredible!
How much have you made?

1449
01:48:04,937 --> 01:48:06,530
Just this one.

1450
01:48:06,605 --> 01:48:10,735
Would you like to help me test it
on this innocent victim of my creation?

1451
01:48:32,297 --> 01:48:33,640
Honey, I'm home!

1452
01:48:33,716 --> 01:48:37,061
Good news. We found a cure
for the zombie infection.

1453
01:48:37,136 --> 01:48:38,308
Honey?

1454
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:03,045
Sorry. It didn't work. I wish it worked.

1455
01:49:03,287 --> 01:49:05,961
I tried. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1456
01:49:07,624 --> 01:49:08,625
John?

1457
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:26,439
This has been
a Charles Kaznyk production.

1458
01:49:27,144 --> 01:49:30,489
We had such a fun time filming
this movie, The Case.

1459
01:49:30,981 --> 01:49:33,655
So much fun that I hope you pick it

1460
01:49:33,734 --> 01:49:37,159
for the Cleveland International
Super 8 Film Festival.

1461
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:38,781
God!
