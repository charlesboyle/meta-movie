1
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,521
<i>It scares us
just thinking about it.</i>

2
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,761
<i>When you hear it, you're gonna
think we 're insane.</i>

3
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:31,610
<i>Try us. Please, from the start.</i>

4
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:38,885
<i>It started out small, like a hand
or a leg was in a different position.</i>

5
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,565
<i>Then its head was looking up
instead of down.</i>

6
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:44,768
 Then one day, it was in
a completely different room.

7
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,489
It was moving around by itself.

8
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:50,803
Ever think maybe somebody had a key
to your apartment and was playing a trick?

9
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:52,643
That's exactly what we thought.

10
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,804
But never once did we find any
sign or evidence of intrusion.

11
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:58,724
And this all led you to believe
that the doll was possessed?

12
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,290
Yes.

13
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:04,160
Camilla got in touch with a medium. We
learned from her that a 7yearold girl..

14
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,243
..named Annabelle Higgins
had died in this apartment.

15
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:11,120
She was lonely and took a liking
to my doll.

16
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,642
All she wanted was to be friends.

17
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:16,166
When we heard this,
we felt really sorry for her.

18
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:19,010
I mean, we're nurses, we help people.

19
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,485
So..

20
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:24,125
..we gave her permission
to move into the doll.

21
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:26,281
Wait, you did what?

22
00:01:26,679 --> 00:01:29,080
She wanted to live with us
by inhabiting the doll.

23
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,445
We said yes.

24
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,000
But then things got worse.

25
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,370
God.

26
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:54,362
<i>When we came home,
she was sitting in the hallway.</i>

27
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,965
<i>But we had left her in the spare room.</i>

28
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,961
Debbie!! Debbie, wait!!

29
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,767
We are beyond terrified.

30
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,930
We don't know what's going on
or what to do. Can you help us?

31
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:00,524
Yes, we can.

32
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,009
Now, firstly, there's no such thing
as Annabelle, and there never was.

33
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,241
Ghosts don't possess such power.

34
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:10,050
I think what we have here is something
extremely manipulative.

35
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,167
It's something inhuman.

36
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,840
It was a big mistake
acknowledging this doll.

37
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:17,161
And through that,
the inhuman spirit tricked you.

38
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,090
You gave it permission
to infest your lives.

39
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:22,488
What's an inhuman spirit?

40
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:26,526
It's something that's never walked
the earth in human form.

41
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:28,808
It's something demonic.

42
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,767
So the doll was never possessed?

43
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,848
No, no, it was used as a conduit.

44
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:39,360
It was moved around to give
the impression of possession.

45
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,205
Demonic spirits don't possess things,
they possess people.

46
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,441
It wanted to get inside of you.

47
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:59,201
All right, that's good, Drew.
You can shut it down now.

48
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,040
Hit the lights.

49
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,167
So we got the church to
send a priest over..

50
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:09,401
..to bless the house and the occupants.

51
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:13,245
Whatever was oppressing that apartment
was no longer with them. Any questions?

52
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,406
Yes.

53
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:18,209
Where's the doll now?

54
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,123
Someplace safe.

55
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,561
 Yep.
 So, what are you guys?

56
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,568
I mean, what do people call you?

57
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,489
Uh, well, we've been called Demonologists.
That's one name for us.

58
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:33,363
Ghost hunters, paranormal researchers.

59
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:35,846
 Kooks.
 Hahaha.

60
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:37,444
Wackos.

61
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:41,763
But we prefer to be known simply
as Ed and Lorraine Warren.

62
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,844
Here we are.

63
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:49,447
Wow, hear that?

64
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,249
 I don't hear anything.
 Exactly.

65
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,639
Oh. Ha!!

66
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:56,087
 Okay. Guys, we are here!!
 Get out of the car.

67
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:58,128
Oh, God, we're in the middle of nowhere.

68
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:01,328
Are you so excited?
Where's my "yes"? Where's my "yes"? Yes!!

69
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,600
I'll race you!!

70
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,000
 Are you guys excited?
 Yes!!

71
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,167
 I'm so excited!!
 Come on, Sadie!!

72
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,849
I get my own room!!

73
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:11,684
Are you kidding me?
No dibs on the rooms!!

74
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,965
 What?
 What?

75
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:16,845
So do I get to pick my own room?
Or do I have no choice in that either?

76
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:22,681
Well, first cute boy she meets,
she'll forget about Jersey.

77
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,125
 Great.
 I hope.

78
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,485
I can't wait.

79
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:27,359
Come on, Sadie.

80
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:29,884
Sadie, let's go.

81
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,483
Hey, come.

82
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,209
What's the matter with you?

83
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:37,123
Hey, come on, girl.

84
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,888
All right, suit yourself.

85
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:49,083
<i> What's your name?
 What's your name?</i>

86
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:51,122
<i> Who's your daddy?
 Who's your daddy?</i>

87
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,969
<i> He rich?
 Is he rich like me?</i>

88
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:54,245
Watch your step.

89
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,844
Coming through.

90
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:57,726
Whoa, watch out, Dad.

91
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,759
 Where do you want it?
 In the living room.

92
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,879
 Andrea, where's my wind chime?
 I think Nancy's got it in the other room.

93
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:05,240
Thanks. Hey, Nancy,
have you seen my wind chime?

94
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,049
 Oh, this one?
 Yeah, thanks.

95
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,043
 You're gonna have to catch it.
 Nancy!! Let go!! Give it here.

96
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,089
You're so mean.

97
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,843
Hey, Mom, can I hang up
my wind chime?

98
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:17,400
Of course. There's a line outside
you can hang it on.

99
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,250
Honey, have April come in, okay?
It's gonna be dark soon.

100
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,685
Okay.

101
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:33,888
Come on, April!! Mom wants us inside!!

102
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,726
Look what I found, Cindy.

103
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:57,724
<i>One..</i>

104
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,286
..two..

105
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:00,565
..three.

106
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,608
Come on, come on, come on.
No peeking.

107
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,124
Four.

108
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:07,448
Are you guys done with the pizza?
I don't want it going to waste.

109
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:10,045
 Let's go.
 It's expensive feeding you girls.

110
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:13,601
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

111
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,920
Where should I hide?

112
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,281
Ready or not, here I come!!

113
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,039
Okay, clap.

114
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:30,607
 Whoa!!
 You don't know the house well enough.

115
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,840
Someone's gonna get hurt.

116
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:33,285
I'm okay, I'm okay.

117
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,570
Second clap.

118
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,090
That's cheating.

119
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,965
Clap.

120
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,884
 Got You!!
 Aah!!

121
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:04,527
 Are you okay? Um..
 Yeah.

122
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:06,564
All right, what did we break now?

123
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,721
 I didn't mean to.
 Move out of there, please.

124
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,643
It was Christine's fault.

125
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,040
 Oh, jeez.
 My fault? Oh, my God.

126
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:15,122
 Christine did it.
 No, I didn't.

127
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,441
 You pushed me.
 No, no, you fell back.

128
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:20,284
Hey, Nancy, can you go get me
the matches, please?

129
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:22,325
What's going on?

130
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:24,481
 Nancy broke something.
 Shut up.

131
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,522
 What broke?
 It's the Wall.

132
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:29,728
 Whoa.
 I think we have a cellar or something.

133
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:33,290
I wanna see, I wanna see.
Move, move, move.

134
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,565
Here, matches. Thank you.

135
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,763
 I wanna see.
 You can see.

136
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,683
 I wanna see.
 You can all see.

137
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:42,045
Move!!

138
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:54,082
Oh, man.

139
00:10:58,839 --> 00:10:59,886
Huh.

140
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,919
Roger?

141
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,365
What do you see down there?

142
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:09,049
Just, uh, hard to tell, you know?

143
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:13,165
It's an old piano
and a whole bunch of garbage.

144
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:17,726
Agh. Son of a..

145
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,963
Wow.

146
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,244
Rog?

147
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:33,010
Come on up.

148
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:37,968
I don't want you girls going down there.

149
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:39,848
 That place is loaded with spiders.
 Ew!!

150
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,086
Just relax. Okay.

151
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:43,560
Stop it, Nancy. It's not funny.

152
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:47,441
We've got extra square footage anyway.
I'll check it out in the morning.

153
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,801
 I wonder why it was boarded up.
 I don't know.

154
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,040
Okay, show's over.

155
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,888
 Five minutes.
 No more minutes.

156
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:55,406
 Up to bed. Please. Thank you.
 Right to bed.

157
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:00,930
Man, I'm fried.

158
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,483
Something's up with Sadie.

159
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:07,600
Yeah, I don't know what her problem is.
Couldn't get her to come inside.

160
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:09,563
We can't leave her out there.

161
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:11,881
She's all right.
I got her on a chain.

162
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:15,969
Sadie, hey, be quiet.

163
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,961
Thanks for making this work.

164
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,008
I know it was a lot to bite off.

165
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,319
It's gonna be great, isn't it?

166
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:28,762
I think it's great already.

167
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,120
Yeah.

168
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:36,003
You still too fried to christen
the new house?

169
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,449
Who said I'm fried?

170
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,003
 Ain't nobody here's fried.
 Ha, ha.

171
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:18,599
Mom?

172
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,206
Hey. How did you guys sleep?

173
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,560
I'm cold.

174
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,244
It is chilly, isn't it?

175
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,245
You think maybe we could have bought
a house with a toilet that actually works?

176
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,446
Tell your father.

177
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:32,728
And there was a funky smell in my
room last night. Like something died.

178
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,483
 Is it still there?
 No.

179
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,686
Problem solved.

180
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:02,560
Roger?

181
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:05,530
Roger?

182
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,444
Down here, honey.

183
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:13,646
Morning.

184
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:17,886
Ooh. Whoa.

185
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,730
This is gonna take some
serious elbow grease.

186
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,080
Yeah.

187
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:24,883
Oh, my God.

188
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,642
What are we gonna do
with all this stuff?

189
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:36,245
Well, we probably ought
to go through it, you know?

190
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,800
There might be some antiques down here
worth a lot.

191
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,644
Yeah, or just a lot of junk
the previous owner didn't want.

192
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,127
 It's ours now.
 Knock yourself out.

193
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,767
 I'm gonna make some coffee.
 Okay.

194
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,967
I'm gonna see if I can get
this furnace working.

195
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:50,928
Yeah, that'd be nice. It's freezing.

196
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:52,240
Yeah.

197
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,883
Hmm.

198
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,044
Sadie!! Come here, Sadie!!

199
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,645
Mommy!!

200
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,284
Mommy, where's Sadie?

201
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:16,763
She's outside. You know, I'm sure  she's 
hungry by now.Why don't you go and get her.

202
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,806
 Whoa.
 Morning, Dad.

203
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,961
 Can you hold this?
 Sure.

204
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:22,803
 Sadie!!
 Slow it down, Scoot.

205
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,245
 Roger.
 Yeah.

206
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:27,568
This clock stopped at 3:07,
and so did the one in the hallway.

207
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,130
That's weird.

208
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,808
Maybe it got knocked around in the move.

209
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,849
Speaking of knocked around,
what did you do to me last night?

210
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:38,764
 Ouch. I didn't do that. Did I?
 I don't know.

211
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:41,365
Sadie!!

212
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:53,366
April!! April!!

213
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,125
What's..? April!! What's going on?

214
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,600
 What happened?
 Oh, my God!!

215
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,410
Oh, Sadie.

216
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:12,567
We keep everything locked in here.

217
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:14,763
Feel free to look around.

218
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,803
Just don't touch anything.

219
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,769
Wow.

220
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,529
This is crazy.

221
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,443
So all these are taken from cases
you've investigated?

222
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:32,570
That's right. Everything you see
in here is either haunted, cursed..

223
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,683
..or has been used in some kind
of ritualistic practice.

224
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,003
Nothing's a toy.

225
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,843
Not even the toy monkey.

226
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,724
Don't touch it.

227
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:49,402
Oh, ahem. Well, isn't it scary,
or doesn't it worry you..

228
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,846
..to have all these items
right in your home?

229
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:55,401
That's why we have a priest that comes by
once a month to bless the room.

230
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,765
Well, the way I see it is:

231
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:59,570
It's safer for these things
to be in here than out there.

232
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,528
It's kind of like keeping guns
off the street.

233
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,762
Why not just throw them
in an incinerator? Destroy them.

234
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,848
Well, that would only destroy the vessel.

235
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,169
Sometimes it's better to keep
the genie in the bottle.

236
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,204
Say, is the, uh, Annabelle doll here?

237
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,484
Right this way.

238
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,085
Yeah.

239
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:32,325
 You said she's a conduit?
 That's right.

240
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:33,685
What does that mean?

241
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,685
A very powerful demonic
has latched itself onto her.

242
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:40,809
So when you guys investigate
these hauntings..

243
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,200
..how do you stop them
from latching onto you?

244
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:44,929
We have to take great precaution.

245
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:46,723
But what about your wife?

246
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,964
What about her?

247
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,888
Well, Father Gordon told me that..

248
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,529
Well, that was different.

249
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:56,889
What happened to my wife
happened during an exorcism.

250
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,723
Well, what's the difference?

251
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,765
Excuse me.

252
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:04,799
Honey, what are you doing?

253
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:06,400
Come here.

254
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:08,920
You know better. All right?

255
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,524
Georgiana?

256
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,086
 Come on. Did you touch anything?
 No.

257
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,570
All right, come on, honey.

258
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:17,970
 Georgiana!! Could you take Judy upstairs?
 Oh, sure.

259
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:20,599
You can't go into this room,
no matter what, remember?

260
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:22,204
 Yes, Daddy.
 All right.

261
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:24,280
 Go on.
 Okay, come on.

262
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:27,488
Let's see if I can find you
a little snack, okay? Come on.

263
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:37,801
Hey. What's going on in here?

264
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:40,439
 Daddy, look.
 You look very pretty.

265
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,966
All right, all done.
Go get dressed for dinner.

266
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:45,963
 I'm wearing it to dinner.
 No, you're not!!

267
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,365
Here you go.

268
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,450
How'd it go?

269
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,727
Oh, I think he may write
a positive article.

270
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:54,802
Ooh, a nonskeptic.

271
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:56,685
That's a pleasant change.

272
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah.

273
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:06,643
Stop blaming yourself.

274
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,044
No sugar.

275
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,684
Be right back.

276
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:19,447
Not funny, Nancy.

277
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:21,839
What?

278
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,607
Stop grabbing my foot.

279
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,927
Shut up, I didn't do anything.

280
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,204
Yeah, right.

281
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:32,887
And stop farting.

282
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:35,128
It really stinks.

283
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:39,041
Don't blame that on me. It's you. Pew.

284
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,400
Dad?

285
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,601
Andrea, what are you doing out of bed?

286
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,045
What's that sound?

287
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:04,124
It's Cindy. She's in my room.
She's sleepwalking again.

288
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,687
I've never seen her do this before.

289
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:28,240
I remembered you saying not
to wake her if she's like this.

290
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:30,322
No, we just put her back to bed.

291
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:33,005
Hey, hey. Sweetie. Shh.

292
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,165
Let's go back to bed.

293
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:47,963
She's okay. Good night.

294
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,325
Night.

295
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:05,448
<i>She's sleepwalking again?
She hasn't done that for a while.</i>

296
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:09,202
She ended up in Andrea's room too.
I think kind of freaked her out.

297
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:11,965
 That's not good. What are we gonna do?
 I don't know.

298
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,690
 Honey, you got another bruise here.
 Hmm?

299
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,290
Does that hurt?

300
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:19,365
That's weird.

301
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,483
I don't know. Will you do me a favor,
go see a doctor for that?

302
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,606
 Yeah, I will. Drive safe.
 Yeah.

303
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:27,488
 I love you.
 I love you too.

304
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:59,085
Bye!!

305
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:00,729
Love you!!

306
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,769
 Cindy, you have your lunch?
 Yeah.

307
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:08,401
Yes, I do.

308
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,402
I miss Sadie a lot.

309
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,926
She was my best friend.

310
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:16,008
You're my friend, right?

311
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,249
Yeah, let's play.

312
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:28,124
 Who are you talking to?
 Rory.

313
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,680
Rory?

314
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:32,081
 He's my new friend.
 Oh, really?

315
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,322
 Yeah, do you want to see him?
 Yeah. Uhhuh. How?

316
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:36,924
With this.

317
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:40,765
When the music stops, you see him
in the mirror standing behind you.

318
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:42,800
Okay.

319
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,882
But you have to twist the key.

320
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,245
Okay.

321
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,409
 Boo, Mommy!! Haha!!
 Oh!!

322
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,889
 April, you just gave me a heart attack.
 Got you!!

323
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:18,922
Well, okay, I guess Rory
doesn't want to see me, huh?

324
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,319
Hmm. Oh, well.

325
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,163
Can we play hideandclap?

326
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:24,606
Hideandcla..?
Oh, honey, I don't want to play.

327
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:28,366
 Please!! Nobody ever lets me play.
 Okay, okay.

328
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:33,327
Remember, you get to ask me
for three claps.

329
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:34,526
Okay.

330
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:37,888
One, two, three.

331
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,689
 I'm gonna go hide now!!
 Okay.

332
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,524
Four, five..

333
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:45,569
..six, seven..

334
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:48,086
..eight, nine..

335
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:49,965
..ten!!

336
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:54,164
First clap!!

337
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,488
Ow. Shit.

338
00:27:15,639 --> 00:27:17,164
Second clap!!

339
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:35,046
April.

340
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:42,444
April.

341
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:55,684
Oh, I know where you're hiding.

342
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:57,961
Give me the third clap.

343
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,964
I'm gonna get you now.

344
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,048
I can hear you breathing.

345
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:19,050
April.

346
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,450
April.

347
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:30,446
Ha, ha. You took your blindfold off.
 I win!!

348
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:34,485
You weren't even warm, Mom.
I was in Christine and Nancy's room.

349
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:42,805
<i>I gotta have some routes here,
or I'm gonna lose the insurance on the rig.</i>

350
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:47,490
That's like half of my rate, man.

351
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:51,161
Yeah, okay.

352
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:54,241
I'll, uh.. Yeah, I'll take it.

353
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,685
Thank you.

354
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,369
 What's the route?
 It's, uh, Florida.

355
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:04,250
It's a week turnaround. I start tomorrow.

356
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,564
We'll get through this.

357
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:09,605
Yeah.

358
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,090
Come on, let's go to bed.

359
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:39,006
Stop it, Nancy. It's not funny anymore.

360
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:42,242
I'm trying to sleep,
please stop grabbing my feet.

361
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:28,044
Nancy?

362
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,609
Nancy?

363
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:35,728
What are you doing?

364
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,650
Christine?

365
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,440
Are you all right?

366
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:46,770
Do you see it?

367
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:50,765
See what?

368
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:58,321
There's someone behind the door.

369
00:31:58,479 --> 00:31:59,719
What?

370
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:04,930
There's someone standing over there.

371
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:09,406
I don't see anyone.

372
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:14,160
It's looking right at us.

373
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,930
Nancy, don't!! Nancy.

374
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:27,525
No, no. Look. Look.

375
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,161
Look, there's no one here. See?

376
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:34,804
Ugh. It's that smell again.

377
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,281
Oh, my God.

378
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:40,923
It's standing right behind you.

379
00:32:56,719 --> 00:32:59,928
Christine?!! Christine!! Christine!!

380
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:02,449
God, it won't op..

381
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:05,722
 Christine!!
 No!! No!! No!!

382
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,923
 What's going on? What happened?
 There was someone else in here!!

383
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:10,126
 What?
 Where?

384
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:13,567
By the door.
It was behind the door.

385
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:16,285
Honey, there's nothing in here.
There's nobody in here.

386
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:18,248
There was someone else in here!!

387
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,848
I was just sleeping, and then
I felt somebody grab my feet.

388
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:25,320
So I thought it was Nancy.

389
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,807
Well, honey, I'm pretty sure
that it was just a bad dream.

390
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:31,565
No!! It talked to me!!

391
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:33,648
It said..

392
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,880
..that it wants my family dead.

393
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:47,399
<i>Mr. Winston!!</i>

394
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,563
Winston? Winston?

395
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,330
Get behind him.

396
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:53,166
Where you off to?

397
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:55,799
I just gotta run to the store
for a few things.

398
00:33:57,159 --> 00:33:59,969
 Why do you even try?
 What? What do you mean?

399
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:02,690
In 15 years have you
ever been able to lie to me?

400
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,809
Father Gordon called. He's got
a case he wants us to look into.

401
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:09,530
I said I'd go check it out myself.
Lorraine, myself.

402
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,044
I'm going with you.

403
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:14,280
I know you're worried
it's gonna happen again.

404
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:16,248
Yeah, I am. I really am.

405
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:23,930
Maybe it's just time we take a break.
Write that book.

406
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,964
Do you remember what you said to me
on our wedding night?

407
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,969
"Can we do it again?"

408
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,000
After that.

409
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:40,239
You said that God brought us together
for a reason. Right?

410
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:43,369
I'm pretty sure it's not to write a book.

411
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:47,723
I'm gonna get dressed.

412
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,366
<i>We've isolated the
disturbances to the attic.</i>

413
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:54,880
<i>I want you to listen for a second.</i>

414
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,280
Oh, my God, that's it.

415
00:34:58,919 --> 00:35:00,364
Do it again, Ed.

416
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:05,561
Right now it's just my weight. But you
take the water coming off the pipe..

417
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:08,290
..combined with the wind coming
through the broken window..

418
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,799
..these boards are gonna expand
and rub against each other.

419
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:14,725
You heard it all through the house because
of these pipes leading to the radiator.

420
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:16,842
So this place isn't haunted?

421
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:18,603
No, it rarely is.

422
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:22,565
Yeah, there's usually always
some kind of rational explanation.

423
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:07,450
Girls, it's way past your bedtime.

424
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:06,049
Who is that?

425
00:39:08,439 --> 00:39:11,010
Who's ever down there,
I'm gonna lock you in now!!

426
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:12,726
Aah!! Unh.

427
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:03,809
Aah!!

428
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:06,444
Help!!

429
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:08,408
Andrea!! Help!!

430
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:35,525
<i>Hey, wanna play hideandclap?</i>

431
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:40,363
Aah!!

432
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:11,399
Cindy?

433
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:28,042
Okay, now..

434
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:30,519
All right?

435
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:32,284
All right, come on.

436
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:33,879
Come on.

437
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:36,125
There you go.

438
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:40,087
Okay, you can just sleep with me tonight,
all right?

439
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:46,324
There you go.

440
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:48,880
There.

441
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:54,965
 Andrea?
 Help!! Help!! Help!!

442
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,763
 Who's in here?
 Andrea!!

443
00:42:58,919 --> 00:43:01,126
Andrea? Andrea!!

444
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:02,405
In here!!

445
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:05,045
Help, Daddy!! Help, it's Andrea!!

446
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:06,644
 Who's in here?
 Andrea!!

447
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,609
What happened?

448
00:43:10,759 --> 00:43:13,205
Somebody, goddamn it,
tell me what's going on here?

449
00:43:17,399 --> 00:43:22,280
<i>Fear is defined as a feeling of agitation
and anxiety caused by the presence..</i>

450
00:43:22,439 --> 00:43:23,964
<i>..or imminence of danger.</i>

451
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:28,642
<i>Whether it's a ghost, a spirit
or an entity, they all feed on it.</i>

452
00:43:28,799 --> 00:43:29,846
Take Maurice here.

453
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:33,202
A FrenchCanadian farmer with
no more than a thirdgrade education..

454
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,886
..yet after he was possessed, spoke
some of the best Latin I'd ever heard.

455
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:38,279
Sometimes backwards.

456
00:43:38,439 --> 00:43:42,160
He'd been molested by his father,
who had also tortured him repeatedly.

457
00:43:43,439 --> 00:43:45,806
A dark spirit made its home in this man.

458
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:50,408
Now, if you look into his eyes,
you can see him tearing blood.

459
00:43:57,959 --> 00:43:59,404
And like that..

460
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:03,723
..an upsidedown cross started
to appear from within his body.

461
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:08,681
All right, Drew, you
can hit the lights.

462
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:10,206
Oh.

463
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:12,726
Did you personally
perform the exorcism?

464
00:44:12,919 --> 00:44:15,729
No, I'm not authorized.
But I've assisted on many.

465
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,842
See, an exorcism
can be very dangerous..

466
00:44:17,999 --> 00:44:21,048
..not only for the victim,
but for anyone in the room.

467
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:24,159
 What happened to Maurice?
 He tried to kill his wife..

468
00:44:24,399 --> 00:44:27,642
..but instead shot her in the arm
and then turned the gun on himself.

469
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:31,246
Maurice had a very troubled life
with little to live for..

470
00:44:31,399 --> 00:44:34,289
..and not even an exorcist
could bring him back.

471
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,888
Which brings us to the three stages
of demonic activity:

472
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:40,280
Infestation, oppression and possession.

473
00:44:40,439 --> 00:44:41,804
Now, infestation:

474
00:44:41,959 --> 00:44:45,930
That's the whispering, the footsteps,
the feeling of another presence..

475
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:49,760
..which ultimately grows
into oppression, the second stage.

476
00:44:49,919 --> 00:44:52,206
Now this is where the victim,
and it's usually the one..

477
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:54,248
..who's the most
psychologically vulnerable..

478
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:57,289
..is targeted specifically
by an external force.

479
00:44:57,439 --> 00:45:00,886
Breaks the victim down.
Crushes their will.

480
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:06,290
And, once in a weakened state, leads them
to the third and final stage: possession.

481
00:45:09,439 --> 00:45:11,009
 Hey, Ed? Lorraine?
 Yeah.

482
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:13,605
There's someone here
that would like to talk to you.

483
00:45:13,759 --> 00:45:14,806
 Hi.
 Thanks, Drew.

484
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:16,449
 Thank you.
 I'll see you later.

485
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:17,680
How can we help you?

486
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:22,163
There's something horrible happening in
my house. Could you come and take a look?

487
00:45:22,439 --> 00:45:24,282
You know, uh, it's getting kinda late.

488
00:45:24,439 --> 00:45:27,204
 We really need to head to our family.
 You don't understand.

489
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,249
But we do. There's usually some
sort of rational explanation..

490
00:45:30,399 --> 00:45:35,166
I have five daughters who are scared to death.
I'm so afraid this thing wants to hurt us.

491
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:39,165
You have a daughter. Wouldn't you do
anything you could to protect her? Please.

492
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,526
Please can you come and take a look?

493
00:45:42,959 --> 00:45:44,245
Of course,we will.

494
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,609
Of course, we will.

495
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:00,681
<i>Come on, Jan!! Open up!!</i>

496
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:03,570
<i>Jan, what happened?</i>

497
00:46:04,919 --> 00:46:06,523
<i>The top of your head turned black.</i>

498
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:08,443
You guys straighten up? Thanks.

499
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,408
<i>Don't be silly, it's a wig.</i>

500
00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:15,690
 Hello. Hi.
 Hi. Hi.

501
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,250
Thanks for coming.

502
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:19,723
 Hi, I'm Roger.
 Lorraine.

503
00:46:19,919 --> 00:46:22,206
Hey, nice to meet you, Roger. Ed Warren.

504
00:46:22,839 --> 00:46:24,648
 Thanks for coming.
 Please, come in.

505
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:26,045
Thank you.

506
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:28,680
So..

507
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:31,843
Oh, my God. Look at you all.
Who are these beautiful young women?

508
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:35,367
This is Andrea, the oldest,
Nancy, Cindy, Christine..

509
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,129
..and April.

510
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:40,284
It's Mr. and Mrs. Warren.

511
00:46:40,879 --> 00:46:43,564
 We're all sleeping down here now.
 Mm.

512
00:46:43,999 --> 00:46:46,764
The girls feel safer and it's warmer.

513
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,646
I'm constantly turning up the heat,
but the house is always freezing.

514
00:46:50,799 --> 00:46:52,722
It's not a problem with the furnace.

515
00:46:52,879 --> 00:46:54,165
I mean, not that I can find.

516
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:03,165
It's gotten a lot
worse the past few nights.

517
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:09,049
There's this awful smell, like rotting meat.
It moves around the house.

518
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:13,080
Uh..

519
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:14,445
What? What is it?

520
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:20,529
Well, rancid smells could indicate
some type of demonic activity.

521
00:47:20,759 --> 00:47:21,840
Oh, my God.

522
00:47:26,279 --> 00:47:28,566
That's to keep those doors
from banging at night.

523
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:32,166
Otherwise, it's like:
All night long, just like that.

524
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:35,647
 Does it come in threes?
 Yeah.

525
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:36,960
It stops at dawn?

526
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:38,765
Uhhuh.

527
00:47:40,759 --> 00:47:44,047
Well, sometimes it's meant
as an insult to the Trinity:

528
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:46,167
The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

529
00:47:47,879 --> 00:47:51,486
You know, it's the damndest thing,
but we also get all kinds of birds..

530
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:54,649
..that will just fly against the side
of the house and break their necks.

531
00:47:54,799 --> 00:47:56,449
Hm. Really?

532
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:59,040
And the clocks stop at 3:07 a.m.

533
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:01,281
 All of them?
 Every one.

534
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:07,443
Oh, we were hanging those
along the stairs.

535
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,888
Something just kept knocking them down,
so we stopped hanging them up.

536
00:48:15,319 --> 00:48:17,606
That's what I was talking about.

537
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,683
It was here when we moved in.

538
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:22,046
There's also a lot of stuff in the cellar.

539
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,450
Show me the cellar.

540
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,165
<i>Look what she made me do.</i>

541
00:48:41,399 --> 00:48:43,800
You picking up anything in here, hon?

542
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:50,284
Something awful happened here, Ed.

543
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,322
Those bruises, they from something
that happened here?

544
00:48:57,479 --> 00:49:01,529
Oh, it's some iron deficiency thing I have.

545
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:07,080
You know, with all that's been going on,
why haven't you just moved out?

546
00:49:07,399 --> 00:49:09,367
I don't know where
we'd move to, you know?

547
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:13,843
We got all our money tied up in this place
and had a lot of repairs on top of that.

548
00:49:14,479 --> 00:49:18,484
And I don't know anybody whose gonna
take in a family of seven indefinitely.

549
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:20,568
That's why we tracked you down.

550
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:22,803
We're glad you found us.

551
00:49:23,279 --> 00:49:25,600
All right, let's get started.

552
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:31,166
My name is Ed Warren.
It's November 1st, 1971.

553
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,361
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron..

554
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:37,729
..who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.

555
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:40,129
Okay, go ahead.

556
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:43,050
Where do I start?

557
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,283
From the first occurrence.

558
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,367
I guess it was the clocks.

559
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:50,487
Mom and Dad tell me
that you have a friend.

560
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:52,880
His name's Rory.
He lives here too.

561
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:54,882
 Hmm.
 But he's always sad.

562
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:56,086
Why is that?

563
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:00,039
He won't tell me but I think
something bad happened to him.

564
00:50:02,759 --> 00:50:05,000
Do you mind if I try to see Rory?

565
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,160
Hey.

566
00:51:47,919 --> 00:51:49,205
What is it?

567
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:14,489
We bought it at auction from the bank, so,
you know, we never knew who lived here.

568
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:24,370
Well, Lorraine and I both feel that
what your house needs is a cleansing.

569
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:26,845
An exorcism.

570
00:52:28,439 --> 00:52:29,884
What, exorcism?

571
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:34,809
I thought that was something
that you do to people.

572
00:52:34,999 --> 00:52:36,364
No, not necessarily, no.

573
00:52:36,999 --> 00:52:38,330
We have to get out of here.

574
00:52:38,479 --> 00:52:40,481
I'm afraid that's not gonna help.

575
00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:44,806
Lorraine saw something, which..

576
00:52:44,959 --> 00:52:46,245
Go ahead, hon.

577
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:52,047
I've been seeing the dark entity
that haunts your house..

578
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:53,724
<i>..and your land.</i>

579
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,766
I saw it first when I came
through your door.

580
00:53:01,919 --> 00:53:04,126
<i>It was latched to your back.</i>

581
00:53:06,479 --> 00:53:10,689
<i>And then I saw it again with the girls
when we walked into the living room.</i>

582
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,886
And it doesn't matter where you go..

583
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,208
..this dark entity has latched itself
to your family..

584
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:18,884
..and it's feeding off you.

585
00:53:21,959 --> 00:53:24,087
Even if we leave?

586
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:26,924
Sometimes when you get haunted,
it's like stepping on gum.

587
00:53:27,479 --> 00:53:29,368
You take it with you.

588
00:53:30,279 --> 00:53:33,522
Look, I gotta tell you,
you have a lot of spirits in here..

589
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:38,287
..but this is the one that I'm most
worried about, because it is so hateful.

590
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:42,009
Okay, so what do we do?
Can we call a priest?

591
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:43,490
I wish it were that easy.

592
00:53:43,639 --> 00:53:47,644
Performing an exorcism is an archaic
procedure. Requires years of training.

593
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:52,569
And even then,
I have seen it go horribly wrong.

594
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:57,240
But before we even get that far,
the church has to authorize it first.

595
00:53:57,399 --> 00:54:00,642
It means we gotta investigate,
gather evidence and provide proof..

596
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:02,329
..and that's the hard part.

597
00:54:04,479 --> 00:54:06,208
Have your children been baptized?

598
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:10,683
Uh, no, we never got around to that.
We're not really a churchgoing family.

599
00:54:10,919 --> 00:54:14,526
Well, you may want to rethink that.
Our presence here could make things worse.

600
00:54:14,679 --> 00:54:15,805
Why?

601
00:54:15,959 --> 00:54:17,324
Because we're a threat.

602
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:20,409
And whatever you're dealing with here
isn't gonna like us.

603
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,120
So far it hasn't done anything violent,
and that's a good sign.

604
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:27,209
So we're gonna have our guy
do some homework on the property..

605
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,168
..to see what we're up against.

606
00:54:31,399 --> 00:54:33,208
<i>Judy, what are you up to?</i>

607
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:36,124
 I got you a present.
 Aah.

608
00:54:36,279 --> 00:54:39,362
Me and Nanna got these
at the church's yard sale.

609
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:41,362
 Honey.
 One for you and one for me.

610
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:43,089
 Aw.
 She put a picture..

611
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:44,525
..of you and Daddy in mine.

612
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:48,202
Nanna said this way
we'll always be together.

613
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:50,885
You'll be with me and I'll be with you.

614
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:55,687
I miss you and Daddy.

615
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:07,445
Hey, hon.

616
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:10,726
Yup.

617
00:55:10,879 --> 00:55:13,723
You're not gonna believe this.
Carolyn's voice didn't record.

618
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:16,126
What do you mean?

619
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:18,285
Listen.

620
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:22,246
<i>My name is Ed Warren.
It's November 1st, 1971.</i>

621
00:55:22,399 --> 00:55:24,242
<i>I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron..</i>

622
00:55:24,399 --> 00:55:27,846
<i>..who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.</i>

623
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,564
<i>Okay, go ahead.</i>

624
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,608
<i>From the first occurrence.</i>

625
00:55:38,199 --> 00:55:39,485
Nothing.

626
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:41,240
The whole time.

627
00:55:41,439 --> 00:55:43,965
 I don't know. You find anything?
 Lots.

628
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:47,569
I mean, it's no wonder they're
going through what they are.

629
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:49,762
That's the original farmhouse.

630
00:55:49,919 --> 00:55:53,002
It was built in 1863 by a man
named Jedson Sherman..

631
00:55:53,239 --> 00:55:55,765
..who was married to a woman
named Bathsheba.

632
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:59,202
Ed, she's related to Mary Towne Estye.

633
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:01,560
She was one of the women
accused of witchcraft in Salem.

634
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:03,602
 She was hung during the trials.
 Wow.

635
00:56:03,759 --> 00:56:06,649
After Bathsheba married Jedson,
they had a baby..

636
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:08,648
..and when the baby was 7 days old..

637
00:56:08,839 --> 00:56:11,729
..Jedson caught her sacrificing it
in front of the fireplace.

638
00:56:11,879 --> 00:56:13,961
She ran out to that tree by the dock..

639
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:16,281
..climbed up, proclaimed her love
to Satan..

640
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:20,330
..cursed anyone who tried
to take her land, and hung herself.

641
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:25,766
Time of death was pronounced at 3:07
in the morning.

642
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:27,883
Well, that explains a few things.

643
00:56:28,039 --> 00:56:29,768
Yeah, so does this.

644
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,080
Her last name's Walker.
She lived there in the '30s.

645
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:36,328
She had a boy named Rory who
mysteriously disappeared in the woods.

646
00:56:36,479 --> 00:56:38,288
Then she killed herself in the cellar.

647
00:56:39,319 --> 00:56:40,366
And that's not all.

648
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:47,720
So, what was the original 200acre farm
has since been subdivided and sold off.

649
00:56:47,919 --> 00:56:51,890
There was another boy who drowned in
a pond here. He lived in a house over here.

650
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:56,169
And a woman who worked as a maid in a
neighboring home, she committed suicide too.

651
00:56:58,079 --> 00:56:59,922
People who took her land.

652
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:03,806
<i>I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron..</i>

653
00:57:03,959 --> 00:57:07,168
<i>..who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.</i>

654
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:10,090
<i>Okay, go ahead.</i>

655
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:15,367
<i>From the first occurrence.</i>

656
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:52,039
Here's Brad.

657
00:57:55,959 --> 00:57:57,449
 You find it okay?
 Oh, yeah.

658
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,964
Drew, this is Officer Brad.

659
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:01,685
Officer Brad Hamilton,
Harrisville, Rhode Island P.D.

660
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:03,728
Hm. Nice to meet you, man.

661
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:07,720
 So you're the lucky new cop, huh?
 Guess so.

662
00:58:07,919 --> 00:58:11,048
 You know you can't shoot ghosts, right?
 Take it easy on him, Drew.

663
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:13,440
All right, guys,
help me get this stuff unloaded.

664
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:16,084
You take this.

665
00:58:17,239 --> 00:58:18,400
Hi, Roger.

666
00:58:22,959 --> 00:58:27,920
All right. When you're finished here, why
don't you hit upstairs, all right, Drew?

667
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:29,285
You got it.

668
00:58:52,039 --> 00:58:53,689
What's wrong with the Chevy?

669
00:58:54,279 --> 00:58:56,281
Ugh, what's not wrong with her?

670
00:58:56,439 --> 00:58:58,601
 Needs a new carburetor to start.
 Oh, yeah?

671
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:01,882
Kind of put fixing her up
on hold for a while.

672
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,484
Yeah. Ahem.

673
00:59:05,439 --> 00:59:07,521
Hey, Brad, hand me a thermostat,
would you?

674
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:12,160
What's this, uh, do?

675
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:14,488
When there's an instant drop
in temperature..

676
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:17,085
..the thermostat
triggers the camera to take a picture.

677
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:19,567
You've actually caught things on film?

678
00:59:19,959 --> 00:59:22,530
Well, yeah, that's, uh, the point.

679
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:26,242
Why, uh..? Why out here?

680
00:59:26,439 --> 00:59:29,170
Well, this is where the witch
committed suicide.

681
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:33,963
She hung herself from that branch
right above where you're standing.

682
00:59:40,479 --> 00:59:42,359
<i>How could a
mother kill her own child?</i>

683
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:44,928
It was never a child to her.

684
00:59:45,079 --> 00:59:48,720
She just used her Godgiven gift
as the ultimate offense against him.

685
00:59:48,879 --> 00:59:51,962
Witches believe it elevates their status
in the eyes of Satan.

686
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:01,880
Mm.

687
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:05,521
Wow.
That's a nice day at the beach, huh?

688
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:07,488
How did you know?

689
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:12,207
It's an insight. It's like a peek through
the curtain into another person's life.

690
01:00:14,599 --> 01:00:16,044
Mm.

691
01:00:16,399 --> 01:00:20,449
That day meant so much to me.
We were driving along the coast.

692
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:23,205
Nancy pointed out
how pretty the view was.

693
01:00:23,799 --> 01:00:26,723
I thought this is a perfect opportunity
for a photo.

694
01:00:26,879 --> 01:00:30,042
<i>We're gonna start fresh, you know?
A new house, a new beginning.</i>

695
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:33,567
<i>You should have seen Roger and the girls.
I've never seen them so happy.</i>

696
01:00:33,719 --> 01:00:34,880
Cheese!!

697
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:38,647
They mean the world to me.

698
01:00:49,239 --> 01:00:51,082
Put your hand flat on the desk.

699
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,448
Yeah, and take it off.

700
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:58,404
Here we go.

701
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:04,886
See?

702
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:07,406
It just reveals to us what
the naked eye can't see.

703
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,089
Pretty far out, isn't it?

704
01:01:09,959 --> 01:01:11,688
Yeah, it's groovy.

705
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:19,567
Drew, you got the Bolex ready for Brad?

706
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:22,080
Yeah, already locked and loaded, sir.

707
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:42,125
What? I had to go.

708
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:07,810
All the rooms are
coming in pretty good.

709
01:02:07,959 --> 01:02:09,199
Good.

710
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:16,164
What's in the bottle?

711
01:02:16,959 --> 01:02:18,006
Holy water.

712
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:22,560
Presence of religious icons..

713
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:25,768
..will get a reaction
from anything unholy.

714
01:02:27,479 --> 01:02:29,208
Sort of pisses them off.

715
01:02:30,519 --> 01:02:34,001
So I set these throughout the house,
see if I can stir things up a bit.

716
01:02:36,879 --> 01:02:40,679
 Like holding a cross to a vampire?
 Yeah. Exactly.

717
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:43,201
Except I don't believe in vampires.

718
01:02:48,279 --> 01:02:49,519
Wasn't me.

719
01:03:04,039 --> 01:03:05,529
Brad, get the camera.

720
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:10,440
Okay.

721
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:21,202
All right, it's 9:18, we're headed down into the
cellar where the door's just opened on its own.

722
01:03:21,399 --> 01:03:24,209
I have Lorraine and Officer Brad Hamilton
with me.

723
01:03:24,439 --> 01:03:26,567
Let's keep the cellar light off.

724
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:43,403
Give us a sign that you wanna
communicate with us.

725
01:04:11,919 --> 01:04:13,444
Hon, you all right?

726
01:04:17,799 --> 01:04:20,245
There's definitely something here.

727
01:04:21,639 --> 01:04:24,768
 All right, close the door. Move something.
 My hands are so cold.

728
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:28,325
Come on.

729
01:04:33,479 --> 01:04:34,640
No.

730
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:36,449
It's gone. It's gone.

731
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,129
I got nothing.

732
01:04:38,439 --> 01:04:39,770
Okay.

733
01:05:00,359 --> 01:05:03,806
Well, like I said, it doesn't
always work when you want it to.

734
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:06,765
Yeah, maybe the camera picked
something up.

735
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:08,845
Watch out!!

736
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:14,164
<i>For a guy who doesn't believe..</i>

737
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:17,687
..you looked a little freaked out
when that door slammed shut.

738
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:22,607
It must have been a draft.

739
01:05:23,079 --> 01:05:24,808
Oh, that's funny.

740
01:05:25,319 --> 01:05:27,925
A draft never put that look
on my face before.

741
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:32,363
I believe the clock.

742
01:05:33,999 --> 01:05:35,603
It's 3:08.

743
01:05:45,799 --> 01:05:47,369
Let me see your glasses.

744
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:48,726
For you.

745
01:05:48,919 --> 01:05:52,640
I think I might take some girls for ice cream later on.
What do you say about that?

746
01:05:52,839 --> 01:05:55,001
 Yeah!!
 Honey, you wanna come?

747
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:58,208
I'm exhausted. I'm just gonna take a nap.
The late nights are getting to me.

748
01:05:58,359 --> 01:06:00,760
That's probably a good idea.
Why don't you get some rest.

749
01:06:00,959 --> 01:06:03,565
 Lorraine and I'll watch over things for a bit.
 Really?

750
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:06,450
I'm gonna take off.
I have a shift starting in an hour.

751
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:08,761
The house hasn't felt like this
in a long time.

752
01:06:08,959 --> 01:06:11,883
I think the kids feel a lot safer
with you around.

753
01:06:15,439 --> 01:06:17,885
 I could get used to this.
 What, me doing laundry?

754
01:06:19,999 --> 01:06:21,842
 Hahaha.
 You're funny.

755
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,004
No, this place.

756
01:06:24,399 --> 01:06:26,481
Nice, fresh country air.

757
01:06:30,279 --> 01:06:32,850
They have such a beautiful family,
don't they?

758
01:06:32,999 --> 01:06:37,482
Yeah, that little one, April,
did you see her bring me pancakes?

759
01:06:42,919 --> 01:06:44,523
We've gotta help them.

760
01:06:44,999 --> 01:06:46,410
I know.

761
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:50,079
 I'll start with the Chevy.
 Heh.

762
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:13,525
Carolyn!!

763
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:15,606
Are you okay?

764
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:16,920
Carolyn, open the door.

765
01:08:17,079 --> 01:08:18,160
Carolyn, open up!!

766
01:08:25,159 --> 01:08:26,206
Are you okay?

767
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:27,645
 Oh, I'm fine.
 Are you sick?

768
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:30,643
 I woke up feeling nauseous, that's all.
 I thought I saw..

769
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:33,040
I hear Roger and the girls.

770
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:34,280
One minute.

771
01:08:46,519 --> 01:08:48,647
 Guys, do you wanna play a game?
 Boring!!

772
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:49,925
Thank you, Daddy.

773
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:52,360
Let's go inside.

774
01:08:56,639 --> 01:08:57,839
I thought that was you.

775
01:08:57,999 --> 01:08:59,205
Hey, I hope you don't mind.

776
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:02,050
I got a good deal on a rebuild
at that wrecking yard in Smithfield.

777
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:05,288
 No, you look like you know what
 you're doing. Yeah, we'll see.

778
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:09,889
Got a nice place here, Roger.

779
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:12,400
Lorraine and I always wanted
a spot in the country.

780
01:09:12,559 --> 01:09:13,890
I'll sell you this one.

781
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:17,604
Hey, hand me a wrench, would you?

782
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:24,688
Hey, uh, it really means a lot
to us to have you here.

783
01:09:24,839 --> 01:09:27,922
I gotta admit, I was a little
bit skeptical going in.

784
01:09:29,119 --> 01:09:32,282
Just wanna say thank you, though,
for coming out when you did.

785
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:37,686
I can't take the credit.
That's, uh.. That's all Lorraine.

786
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:40,604
 I didn't want to.
 Oh. Why's that?

787
01:09:43,919 --> 01:09:47,321
Whatever Lorraine sees, feels, touches,
it helps people.

788
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:49,607
But it also takes a toll on her.

789
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:51,204
Little piece each time.

790
01:09:55,159 --> 01:09:57,890
Couple months ago
we were working on a case.

791
01:09:59,439 --> 01:10:01,168
She saw something.

792
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:13,204
It took a real big piece.

793
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:16,644
When we got home..

794
01:10:16,839 --> 01:10:19,843
..she went into our room,
locked herself in..

795
01:10:19,999 --> 01:10:22,843
..didn't talk, didn't eat,
didn't come out for eight days.

796
01:10:23,799 --> 01:10:25,130
What'd she see?

797
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:29,319
Get out of here!!

798
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,639
I don't know.

799
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:33,809
And I won't ask.

800
01:10:51,399 --> 01:10:54,562
I need to reload. You want some?

801
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:56,564
I'm good, thanks.

802
01:10:57,399 --> 01:10:58,685
All right.

803
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:45,242
Look what she made me do.

804
01:12:28,919 --> 01:12:31,240
Look what she made me do.

805
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:35,285
Hey.

806
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:43,766
Ed?

807
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:45,165
Look what she made me do!!

808
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,963
Ed!! Ed!!

809
01:12:49,599 --> 01:12:50,839
Ed!!

810
01:12:51,959 --> 01:12:53,165
Dude, you okay?

811
01:12:53,319 --> 01:12:54,809
Hold up, Brad. What's going on?

812
01:12:54,959 --> 01:12:57,883
I saw someone. There was
a woman dressed as a maid.

813
01:13:01,559 --> 01:13:03,527
Ed? Ed, we're getting something.

814
01:13:08,799 --> 01:13:11,643
 It's just Cindy. She's sleepwalking.
 No, wait. We need this.

815
01:13:11,799 --> 01:13:13,400
Why do we need pictures of Cindy?

816
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:15,844
She didn't trigger it.

817
01:13:15,999 --> 01:13:19,321
 What do you mean she didn't trigger it?
 Somebody's with her.

818
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:23,640
Who?

819
01:13:27,559 --> 01:13:28,924
Cindy!!

820
01:13:32,639 --> 01:13:33,925
Cindy!!

821
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:42,090
Cindy!!

822
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:43,889
Hey, over here. It's safe.

823
01:13:44,039 --> 01:13:45,928
There's someone else in there with her.

824
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:49,520
I'm hearing another voice. Here, listen.

825
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:56,526
Follow me. This way.

826
01:13:57,999 --> 01:13:59,808
<i>This is where I hide.</i>

827
01:14:04,959 --> 01:14:06,199
Cindy?

828
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:10,050
Cindy?

829
01:14:11,879 --> 01:14:13,040
Where'd she go, Ed?

830
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:15,043
Windows are locked.

831
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:20,047
Ed, where'd she go?

832
01:14:21,559 --> 01:14:22,924
Brad, get the UV light.

833
01:14:23,079 --> 01:14:25,241
 The what?
 Just ask Drew.

834
01:14:26,359 --> 01:14:29,169
 Drew, I need a UV light.
 Uh..

835
01:14:29,319 --> 01:14:30,844
Here, that's it. Go, go, go, go!!

836
01:14:37,399 --> 01:14:38,924
Turn off the light.

837
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,129
Get out of the way.

838
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:48,405
Okay.

839
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,204
Hit the lights!!

840
01:15:31,279 --> 01:15:32,769
Found her.

841
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:35,446
Here we go.

842
01:15:36,039 --> 01:15:38,280
 All right. You got her?
 Yeah.

843
01:15:49,999 --> 01:15:53,048
That's where Rory hides
when he's afraid.

844
01:16:18,839 --> 01:16:21,763
Hon? Could I have April's
music box, please?

845
01:16:24,839 --> 01:16:27,570
 How's Cindy?
 She doesn't remember a thing.

846
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:31,850
Here you go.

847
01:16:32,599 --> 01:16:33,885
Thank you.

848
01:17:11,519 --> 01:17:12,884
Lorraine!!

849
01:17:16,959 --> 01:17:18,199
No.

850
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:32,319
Lorraine!!

851
01:17:32,559 --> 01:17:33,799
Lorraine!!

852
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:39,570
Lorraine!!

853
01:17:40,359 --> 01:17:41,770
Lorraine!!

854
01:18:32,919 --> 01:18:35,650
She made me do it.

855
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:39,290
She made me do it.

856
01:19:00,959 --> 01:19:03,610
She made me do it.

857
01:19:47,319 --> 01:19:48,366
Ed!!

858
01:19:48,559 --> 01:19:50,368
Come on!! Lorraine!!

859
01:19:58,199 --> 01:19:59,325
Ed!!

860
01:20:00,199 --> 01:20:01,883
Ed, I know what she did.

861
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:04,650
 I got you. I know. It's okay.
 I know what she did.

862
01:20:04,799 --> 01:20:07,723
I know what she did. She possessed
the mother to kill the child.

863
01:20:07,879 --> 01:20:09,404
She visits Carolyn every night.

864
01:20:09,559 --> 01:20:12,403
That's what the bruise marks are!!
She's feeding off of her!!

865
01:20:25,519 --> 01:20:27,089
Uh..

866
01:20:27,319 --> 01:20:28,764
Nancy?

867
01:20:33,239 --> 01:20:34,479
Nancy!!

868
01:20:34,879 --> 01:20:36,165
Are you okay?

869
01:20:36,759 --> 01:20:38,090
Nancy!!

870
01:20:39,599 --> 01:20:40,646
Grab her!!

871
01:20:43,159 --> 01:20:44,729
Daddy!! Help!!

872
01:20:45,599 --> 01:20:46,680
Nancy!!

873
01:20:53,919 --> 01:20:55,000
Is she okay?

874
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:56,405
It's okay, I got you.

875
01:20:56,559 --> 01:20:57,606
Did you get that?

876
01:20:59,879 --> 01:21:01,085
Yeah.

877
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:07,243
I'll have the footage developed
and get it over to Father Gordon.

878
01:21:07,399 --> 01:21:11,404
He's our liaison at the church.
I imagine we'll get a pretty fast response.

879
01:21:11,559 --> 01:21:13,607
 Listen, Roger?
 Yeah?

880
01:21:13,799 --> 01:21:16,962
Listen, when we get the exorcist,
I'll be back. But Lorraine..

881
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:20,202
 Yeah, I understand. Until then, 
Drew's gonna keep an eye on you.

882
01:21:20,359 --> 01:21:22,726
 Hey, Ed, thank you for everything.
 Yeah.

883
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:25,445
<i>Mommy?</i>

884
01:21:27,759 --> 01:21:29,409
That's everything.

885
01:21:41,319 --> 01:21:42,684
<i>Mommy?</i>

886
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:02,125
Judy?

887
01:22:02,439 --> 01:22:03,804
Oh, God!!

888
01:22:03,959 --> 01:22:05,085
Judy?

889
01:22:13,759 --> 01:22:15,682
Lorraine!! Wait!!

890
01:22:17,279 --> 01:22:18,804
Lorraine. What?

891
01:22:18,959 --> 01:22:20,324
Mom, it's me. Is Judy okay?

892
01:22:20,479 --> 01:22:22,959
 What?
 Can you go check, please?

893
01:22:23,519 --> 01:22:25,203
Damn it, Mom, just check, please!!

894
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:28,203
 Are you gonna tell me what's going on?
 It's Judy.

895
01:22:28,359 --> 01:22:29,884
What? What do you mean?

896
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:32,005
What?

897
01:22:33,359 --> 01:22:35,521
Oh, thank God.

898
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:39,368
Mom, I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you. I'll explain later, okay?

899
01:22:40,999 --> 01:22:42,330
What the hell happened?

900
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:45,961
I had a vision of Judy in the water.

901
01:22:46,119 --> 01:22:48,406
I know it was some kind of warning.

902
01:22:49,639 --> 01:22:51,129
I know it.

903
01:22:51,279 --> 01:22:52,519
Okay.

904
01:22:54,559 --> 01:22:55,890
Let's get out of here.

905
01:23:43,879 --> 01:23:46,359
 So?
 Yeah, well, you weren't kidding.

906
01:23:46,519 --> 01:23:47,600
No.

907
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:52,563
Look, Ed, this is complicated
because the kids aren't baptized.

908
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:55,962
 No, I understand. And the family,
 are not members of the church.

909
01:23:56,119 --> 01:23:57,450
 Oh, come on.
 And..

910
01:23:58,279 --> 01:24:01,761
The approval would have to come
directly from the Vatican.

911
01:24:03,119 --> 01:24:06,043
Father, we've never seen nothing like this.

912
01:24:09,919 --> 01:24:12,650
Yeah, well, neither have I.

913
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:23,248
Father, they don't have a lot of time.

914
01:24:23,839 --> 01:24:25,079
All right.

915
01:24:26,559 --> 01:24:28,163
I'll push it through myself.

916
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:30,287
 Thank you, Father. Thank you.
 Thank you.

917
01:24:30,839 --> 01:24:33,763
 All right, we'll wait for your call.
 Yeah.

918
01:25:37,559 --> 01:25:39,721
Mommy? Daddy?

919
01:25:57,159 --> 01:25:58,570
Mommy?

920
01:25:59,079 --> 01:26:00,410
Daddy?

921
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:25,604
Dad?

922
01:26:41,919 --> 01:26:43,364
Nanna?

923
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:46,010
Nanna?

924
01:26:58,999 --> 01:27:00,285
Aah!!

925
01:27:40,319 --> 01:27:41,844
Nanna!!

926
01:27:42,039 --> 01:27:44,849
Nanna, help!! Nanna, help!!

927
01:27:44,999 --> 01:27:46,046
Judy?

928
01:27:46,199 --> 01:27:46,699
Nanna!!

929
01:27:51,039 --> 01:27:52,325
Help!!

930
01:27:52,759 --> 01:27:54,363
 Judy!!
 Nanna!!

931
01:27:54,559 --> 01:27:56,368
 Judy, open the door!!
 Mom!!

932
01:27:58,359 --> 01:28:00,361
 Ed, there's something wrong.
 What?

933
01:28:03,559 --> 01:28:04,640
Nanna!!

934
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:06,883
 Judy!!
 Help!!

935
01:28:07,039 --> 01:28:09,201
 Judy!! Judy, open this door!!
 What is it?

936
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:12,488
 What's wrong with her? Judy!!
 Hey, move. Move, move, move, move.

937
01:28:12,679 --> 01:28:14,283
Judy, get back, honey. Get back!!

938
01:28:14,799 --> 01:28:16,164
 Come on!!
 Hurry.

939
01:28:16,879 --> 01:28:18,802
Help!! Help!!

940
01:28:19,519 --> 01:28:21,089
Get away from the door, Judy!!

941
01:28:24,079 --> 01:28:25,968
Aah!!

942
01:28:26,119 --> 01:28:27,803
Oh, God!! Are you okay?

943
01:28:27,959 --> 01:28:32,044
There was someone rocking
in the chair with Annabelle.

944
01:28:35,119 --> 01:28:36,245
What?

945
01:28:39,479 --> 01:28:40,719
It's okay.

946
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:02,084
She's still in the case.

947
01:29:04,879 --> 01:29:05,926
It's okay.

948
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:08,769
It's okay. It's okay.

949
01:29:14,279 --> 01:29:16,680
 Dad!! Dad!!
 Daddy!!

950
01:29:16,839 --> 01:29:19,206
Dad!! Dad!! Mom just left
with Christine and April.

951
01:29:19,359 --> 01:29:21,839
She went in the car and drove away.
I don't know what happened.

952
01:29:21,999 --> 01:29:24,640
 She smells like rotting meat.
 She didn't say what was going on.

953
01:29:24,679 --> 01:29:28,286
 What do you mean, she left? Left where?
 Gone!! I don't know where she was going.

954
01:29:33,639 --> 01:29:35,368
Where are we going, Mom?

955
01:29:43,959 --> 01:29:45,245
 Hello?
<i> It's Roger.</i>

956
01:29:45,439 --> 01:29:46,770
<i>Somethings going on with Carolyn.</i>

957
01:29:46,959 --> 01:29:49,803
Andrea was here, said Carolyn took
off with Christine and April.

958
01:29:49,959 --> 01:29:52,799
<i> The girls said she smelled
 like rotten meat.</i>.. Possesses the mother..

959
01:29:52,879 --> 01:29:55,644
..to kill the child, that's what she does.
She's taking them to the house.

960
01:29:55,799 --> 01:29:57,679
Roger, get back to the house now.
I'll meet you.

961
01:29:57,799 --> 01:30:01,246
Lock the door, close the blinds.
Stay off the phone!!

962
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:03,605
Go.

963
01:30:08,959 --> 01:30:10,800
 I'm coming.
 No, you stay with Judy.

964
01:30:10,919 --> 01:30:13,320
Only way to protect Judy
is if we stop this where it started.

965
01:30:13,479 --> 01:30:16,608
Otherwise, she'll latch onto us again.
 That's exactly why I am going.

966
01:30:16,799 --> 01:30:19,405
You think I'm gonna let you walk
into this alone?

967
01:30:20,079 --> 01:30:21,410
I can't lose you.

968
01:30:21,999 --> 01:30:23,239
You won't.

969
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:26,083
Let's finish this together.

970
01:30:44,919 --> 01:30:47,604
 Agh!! It's locked.
 Carolyn!!

971
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:49,206
Roger!!

972
01:30:49,359 --> 01:30:50,485
Get out of the way!!

973
01:30:56,719 --> 01:30:58,369
 Roger!!
 Ed!!

974
01:30:58,519 --> 01:31:00,123
 Carolyn!!
 Ed!!

975
01:31:01,279 --> 01:31:02,679
 Carolyn!!
 We're down here!!

976
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:05,563
Carolyn, don't!!
No, no!! She's got..!!

977
01:31:05,719 --> 01:31:07,847
Get her hand!! Get the scissors!!

978
01:31:19,079 --> 01:31:21,446
 We gotta get her to the car!!
 And bring her where?

979
01:31:21,639 --> 01:31:23,607
To take her to the priest
for the exorcism.

980
01:31:23,799 --> 01:31:25,164
 Where's April?
 April?

981
01:31:27,519 --> 01:31:28,805
April!!

982
01:31:29,479 --> 01:31:31,686
Take Christine to the car and find April!!

983
01:31:31,879 --> 01:31:32,926
April!!

984
01:31:34,079 --> 01:31:35,365
Come on!!

985
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:47,880
 She won't let her leave the house.
 What do you mean?

986
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:50,320
 If we take her out,
 the witch will kill her. Agh!!

987
01:31:56,919 --> 01:31:59,684
Roger!!

988
01:31:59,839 --> 01:32:01,204
Carolyn!!

989
01:32:01,559 --> 01:32:02,606
Go!!

990
01:32:02,759 --> 01:32:03,840
Carolyn?

991
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:11,440
Okay, I'm gonna put you in here.
Come on.

992
01:32:11,599 --> 01:32:14,250
 Get in. Stay in here.
 I don't wanna stay here by myself.

993
01:32:14,399 --> 01:32:16,208
Stay in here no matter what.
I'll be back.

994
01:32:16,359 --> 01:32:18,805
I have to find April, okay?
I'll be back, I promise.

995
01:32:21,759 --> 01:32:22,920
April?

996
01:32:25,879 --> 01:32:27,119
You Okay?

997
01:32:32,039 --> 01:32:33,279
Stop!!

998
01:32:36,759 --> 01:32:38,841
Brad!! Brad!!

999
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:44,289
Aah!!

1000
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:54,482
Let's get something to tie her up!!

1001
01:33:02,079 --> 01:33:03,444
Hold it.

1002
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:16,924
I gotta call Father Gordon.
We gotta get him out here.

1003
01:33:17,079 --> 01:33:19,446
He's too far away.
She won't make it. Look at her.

1004
01:33:30,079 --> 01:33:32,525
 Then you need to leave.
 What are you talking about?

1005
01:33:32,839 --> 01:33:34,807
I have to do it. The exorcism.

1006
01:33:35,279 --> 01:33:38,203
What? I thought you said we
need a priest. You're not a priest.

1007
01:33:38,399 --> 01:33:40,845
 Well, you got a better idea?
 He can do it.

1008
01:33:41,919 --> 01:33:44,126
 You can do it.
 But you gotta get out of here.

1009
01:33:44,279 --> 01:33:47,886
I'm not leaving you!! Damn it, 
I'm not doing this with you in here!

1010
01:33:49,719 --> 01:33:52,962
God brought us together for a reason.
This is it.

1011
01:33:53,919 --> 01:33:55,569
I'm gonna get the book.

1012
01:34:12,159 --> 01:34:13,524
April!!

1013
01:34:22,399 --> 01:34:23,764
April!!

1014
01:34:45,399 --> 01:34:49,120
"In the name of the Father,
the Son, the Holy Spirit."

1015
01:35:28,799 --> 01:35:29,960
April!!

1016
01:36:29,879 --> 01:36:31,961
Hold her still!! Hold her still!!

1017
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:33,883
Come here!! Hold her still!!

1018
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:43,959
April?

1019
01:36:50,839 --> 01:36:51,886
April!!

1020
01:36:52,039 --> 01:36:53,609
April, you under there?

1021
01:36:54,999 --> 01:36:56,080
April!!

1022
01:37:01,719 --> 01:37:04,723
Carolyn. Carolyn. Don't give in!!
Don't let her take you!!

1023
01:37:04,919 --> 01:37:06,967
Ed!! You gotta stop,
you're killing her. Stop!!

1024
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:08,484
No, he can't!!

1025
01:37:09,439 --> 01:37:13,330
Roger, help me!!

1026
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:20,241
Ed!! Goddamn it, stop it!!

1027
01:37:20,399 --> 01:37:22,845
Understand this!! We are
now fighting for her soul!!

1028
01:37:22,999 --> 01:37:26,242
"In the name of Jesus Christ,
the saints and all the angels..

1029
01:37:26,439 --> 01:37:28,521
..I command you to reveal yourself!!"

1030
01:37:57,919 --> 01:38:00,490
Roger, help me!!

1031
01:38:51,719 --> 01:38:53,130
Put her down!!

1032
01:38:54,079 --> 01:38:55,285
Put her down!!

1033
01:38:57,479 --> 01:38:58,560
Put her down!!

1034
01:39:00,439 --> 01:39:01,645
Carolyn!!

1035
01:39:01,879 --> 01:39:03,165
Carolyn!!

1036
01:39:05,839 --> 01:39:08,001
 Ed, look out!!
 Unh!!

1037
01:39:11,439 --> 01:39:12,964
Are you okay?

1038
01:39:14,959 --> 01:39:16,927
Hold her still!! Don't let her up!!

1039
01:39:17,079 --> 01:39:18,490
We're losing her, Roger!!

1040
01:39:18,679 --> 01:39:21,205
Damn you!! You leave my family alone,
you hear me?

1041
01:39:21,359 --> 01:39:24,010
I don't know what you are, but you leave
my wife alone, goddamn it!!

1042
01:39:24,159 --> 01:39:27,163
Let her go!!
Do you hear me? Let her go!!

1043
01:39:29,559 --> 01:39:31,960
Let her go, goddamn it!! Let her go!!

1044
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:40,481
She's already gone.

1045
01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:43,327
And now you're all gonna die.

1046
01:39:50,799 --> 01:39:51,880
April!!

1047
01:39:52,039 --> 01:39:55,930
I found her!! She's under the house!!
Under the kitchen!!

1048
01:39:57,439 --> 01:39:58,520
Don't!! No!!

1049
01:39:59,359 --> 01:40:00,690
Get her!!

1050
01:40:15,079 --> 01:40:16,524
 Here.
 Carolyn!!

1051
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:21,407
 Carolyn!!
 She's in that hole. Right there.

1052
01:40:23,999 --> 01:40:26,127
Carolyn? Oh, my God. No!!

1053
01:40:26,279 --> 01:40:29,010
Can't go in. Can't reach.

1054
01:40:29,439 --> 01:40:30,679
No!! Carolyn, don't!!

1055
01:40:33,079 --> 01:40:34,410
Carolyn, no!!

1056
01:40:34,679 --> 01:40:36,568
Bathsheba!!

1057
01:40:38,919 --> 01:40:42,969
By the power of God,
I condemn you back to hell!!

1058
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:46,929
This is your daughter!!

1059
01:40:49,079 --> 01:40:51,764
 You can't give in!!
 Agh!!

1060
01:40:51,919 --> 01:40:54,160
Roger. We need to get her
to fight from the inside.

1061
01:40:54,319 --> 01:40:56,890
Don't let her do this.
Don't let this thing do this.

1062
01:40:57,039 --> 01:40:59,280
You gotta fight it.
You're stronger than she is.

1063
01:40:59,439 --> 01:41:01,328
 You gotta fight!!
 Keep it going, Roger!!

1064
01:41:01,479 --> 01:41:04,244
You gotta stay with us, all right?
Come on back, Carolyn.

1065
01:41:04,799 --> 01:41:06,289
You're in, that's it!! Get her back!!

1066
01:41:06,439 --> 01:41:09,090
 Remember what you showed me.
 No!!

1067
01:41:10,999 --> 01:41:13,479
Remember that day that you said
you would never forget.

1068
01:41:23,199 --> 01:41:25,566
You said they
meant the world to you.

1069
01:41:26,119 --> 01:41:28,326
This is what you'll be leaving behind.

1070
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:08,485
Mommy?

1071
01:42:36,119 --> 01:42:37,484
Oh.

1072
01:42:41,719 --> 01:42:43,209
It's over.

1073
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:45,283
I am so sorry.

1074
01:42:45,439 --> 01:42:49,444
I love you so much. I love you so much.

1075
01:42:49,639 --> 01:42:50,970
I love you so much.

1076
01:42:52,319 --> 01:42:53,923
I'm so happy.

1077
01:43:15,879 --> 01:43:17,608
A draft do that to your face?

1078
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:20,481
I'd take a guy with a gun any day.

1079
01:43:24,679 --> 01:43:26,204
You did good.

1080
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:28,050
No, you did.

1081
01:44:28,679 --> 01:44:31,808
I'll call Father Gordon
and let him know what happened.

1082
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:34,289
Sounds good.

1083
01:44:59,519 --> 01:45:02,125
The Vatican approved the exorcism.

1084
01:45:02,439 --> 01:45:04,441
Heh. Nice timing.

1085
01:45:06,039 --> 01:45:09,725
And if we can, then he'd like
to meet with us tomorrow.

1086
01:45:09,879 --> 01:45:12,405
There's a case in Long Island
he'd like to discuss.

1087
01:45:12,559 --> 01:45:13,640
Really?

1088
01:45:21,999 --> 01:45:23,999
