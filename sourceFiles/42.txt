and, uh, they'll hear only yours.

174
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,968
Follow a blow with a blow and they'll say,
"The Negro lost his temper."

175
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,169
That "The Negro does not belong."

176
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,641
Your enemy will be out in force...

177
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,247
...and you cannot meet him
on his own low ground.

178
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,964
We win with hitting, running, fielding.
Only that.

179
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,330
We win if the world is convinced
of two things:

180
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,804
That you are a fine gentleman
and a great baseball player.

181

...you gotta have the guts...

183
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,649
...to turn the other cheek.

184
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,409
Can you do it?

185
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,561
You give me a uniform...

186
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,208
...you give me a, heh,
number on my back...

187

Uh...

196
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,804
I don't want to say on the phone.

197
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,682
In fact, I'm not supposed to tell anyone.

198
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,565
What's going on? Aren't you supposed
to be playing in Chicago?

How about right now?

00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,048
Did my mom look happy?

213
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,407
Yes. You know your mother loves me.

214

- Heh, your brother?
- Ha, ha.

so many happy-looking people.

Did Jack Robinson look happy?

Oh, boy.

00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,761
We have to lighten the plane.

00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,046
There's some bad weather east of here.

246
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,931
A heavy plane is dangerous.

247
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,568
So someone'll have to cancel.

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,770
Look, I'm with the Brooklyn Dodger
organization.

Man, you two looked wiped out.

Uh-huh.

00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,367

Montreal just a few blocks from here.

277
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,888
Joe and Duff Harris live here.

278
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,406
He gets out the Negro vote.
He does a lot of good for colored people.

279
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,161
Now, Mr. Rickey set it up himself.

"If the Robinsons can't stay
at the hotels...

281

...they should stay someplace
that represents something."

at the end of the week...

to Sanford. It's about 45 minutes away.

- Morning, Leo.
- Good morning, Mr. Rickey.

00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,082
That's not exactly a headline.

It's all I got.

308
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,488
Look, Jack, right now,
it's just me asking you.

309
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,843
But there's gonna be The New York Times
and the Sporting News.

310
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,322
- You should think about it.
- If they ask something, I'll answer it.

Okay, well here's one for you:

312
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,886
What if one of these white pitchers
throws at you?

313
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,367
Look, they're gonna try to get under
your skin. You need to be ready.

314
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,329
Listen, listen.

315
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,091
You know...

316
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,083
You know how when you're
at the plate...

317
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,686
...you want to see the ball
come in slow?

318
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,004
You want to see these questions
come in slow too.

319
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,726
Hey, Jackie. Jackie, you think you can
make it with these white boys?

320
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,966
Uh, I had no problems with white men
in the service or at UCLA.

321
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,044
What you gonna do if one of these
pitchers throws at your head?

322
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,725
Yeah, Jack.

323
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,884
- I'll duck.
- Heh, that's a good one.

MAN:
Hey, Jack, what's your natural position?

325
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,203
I've been playing shortstop.

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,931

I'm still trying to make Montreal.

330
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,647
Hey, Jack.
Hey, Jack, is this about politics?

331
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,046
It's about getting paid.

332
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,249
MAN: "About getting paid." Hear what he
said? "it's about getting paid."

333
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,526
He's gotta be kidding.

334
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,808
Yeah. Good luck, Hop.

335
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,130
Clay, Jackie Robinson.

336
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,922
Jackie, I'd like you to meet Clay Hopper.
Manager of the Montreal Royals.

337
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,481
Jack. They call me Hop.

338
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,446
Now, we ain't doing much today.
Just tossing the ball around, hitting a few.

339
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,002
You can probably toss with those fellows
over there.

340
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,123
Jorgensen, come here!

341
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,764
You're not playing him at shortstop,
huh, Clay?

342
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,521
Oh, he's getting by on a quick release.
His arm's too weak for short.

343
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,081
I think second base is his spot.

344
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,411
I agree.

345
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,725
Clay...

346
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,002
...I need you to get the other players
to act like gentlemen around him.

347
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,049
Treat him like they would
any other teammate.

348
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,281

...Jackie Robinson and the Brooklyn
Dodgers are doing exactly that.

in the head earlier in the season...
