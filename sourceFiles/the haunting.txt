1
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:19,779
<i>An evil old house,
the kind some people call haunted...</i>

2
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:24,317
<i>...is like an undiscovered country
waiting to be explored.</i>

3
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:29,330
<i>Hill House had stood for 90 years
and might stand for 90 more.</i>

4
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:34,039
<i>Silence lay steadily against the wood
and stone of Hill House.</i>

5
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:38,581
<i>And whatever walked there walked alone.</i>

6
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,433
<i>Scandal, murder, insanity, suicide.</i>

7
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:19,064
<i>The history of Hill House was ideal.</i>

8
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,226
<i>It had everything I wanted.</i>

9
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,066
<i>It was built 90-odd,
very odd, years ago...</i>

10
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,607
<i>...by a man named Hugh Crain
as a home for his wife and daughter...</i>

11
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,152
<i>...in the most remote part of
New England he could find.</i>

12
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,618
<i>It was an evil house from the beginning.</i>

13
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,878
<i>A house that was born bad.</i>

14
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,091
<i>Hugh Crain's young wife died...</i>

15
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,052
<i>...seconds before she was to set eyes
on the house.</i>

16
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,223
<i>She was killed when,
for no apparent reason...</i>

17
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:01,983
<i>...the horses bolted, crashing
her carriage against a big tree.</i>

18
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,231
<i>Mrs. Crain was carried...</i>

19
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:12,618
<i>...uh, lifeless is the word, I think...</i>

20
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,825
<i>...into the home
her husband had built for her.</i>

21
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,247
<i>Hugh Grain was left an embittered man...</i>

22
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,788
<i>...with a small daughter,
Abigail, to bring up.</i>

23
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,816
<i>Fortunately, for me, that is.-.</i>

24
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,069
<i>...Hugh Crain did not leave Hill House.</i>

25
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,195
<i>He married again.</i>

26
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,207
<i>The second Mrs. Crain's death
was even more interesting...</i>

27
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,538
<i>...than her predecessor's.</i>

28
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:19,768
<i>I've been unable to find out
how or why she fell...</i>

29
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,145
<i>...although I have my suspicions.</i>

30
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,856
<i>Hugh Crain left Abigail with</i> a <i>nurse</i>
<i>and went to England...</i>

31
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,616
<i>...where he died in a drowning accident.</i>

32
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:35,867
<i>Marvelous.</i>

33
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:40,281
<i>I mean, the way the history of Hill
House follows a classic pattern.</i>

34
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,582
<i>For some reason, Abigail always
kept that same nursery room...</i>

35
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,248
<i>...in Hill House where she grew up...</i>

36
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,542
<i>...and grew old.</i>

37
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,268
<i>In later years,
she became a bedridden invalid.</i>

38
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:13,530
<i>She took a girl from the village
to live with her as a paid companion.</i>

39
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,785
<i>It's with this young companion...</i>

40
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:22,994
<i>...the evil reputation of Hill House
really begins.</i>

41
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,294
<i>The story goes that the old
lady died calling for help...</i>

42
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,584
<i>...in the nursery upstairs...</i>

43
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,800
<i>...while the companion fooled around
with a farmhand on the veranda.</i>

44
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,774
<i>The companion inherited Hill House
and occupied it for many years.</i>

45
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,689
<i>The local people believe that,
one way or another...</i>

46
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,574
<i>...she had murdered her benefactor.</i>

47
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,908
<i>She lived a life of complete solitude
in the empty house...</i>

48
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,040
<i>...though some say
that the house was not empty...</i>

49
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:09,749
<i>...and never has been
since the night old Miss Abby died.</i>

50
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:14,963
<i>They say that whatever there was
and still is in the house...</i>

51
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,629
<i>...eventually drove the companion mad.</i>

52
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,305
<i>We do know she hanged herself.</i>

53
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,593
<i>After her death...</i>

54
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,185
<i>...the house passed legally into the hands
of a distant relative in Boston...</i>

55
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:34,774
<i>...an old lady, Mrs. Sannerson,
who I very much wanted to see.</i>

56
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,448
All my life I've been looking
for an honestly haunted house.

57
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:42,657
In the interests of psychic research, you must
let me have it for a few weeks during my leave.

58
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:47,871
No one who rented Hill House
ever stayed for more than a few days.

59
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:51,378
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.

60
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:55,458
I don't believe it. Dr. Markway
is a trained anthropologist...

61
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:58,002
...a respected member
of a university faculty.

62
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,591
We should welcome such a man
to investigate Hill House.

63
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:01,801
Perhaps.

64
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,887
As an old woman due shortly
to enter the next world...

65
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,472
...I'd like to know if there is one.

66
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:10,856
I'm sure his report will give Hill House
a clean bill of health.

67
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:14,689
How will you go about conducting
your investigations, Dr. Markway?

68
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:19,072
Well, I shall occupy the house with a group
of carefully selected assistants--

69
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,277
Assistants?

70
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,158
Well, my dear Mrs. Sannerson...

71
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,366
...I am a scientist
conducting an unusual experiment.

72
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,872
A haunted house. Everyone laughs.

73
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,125
So I must have specially
qualified help...

74
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,753
...to take notes and document any evidence
of the supernatural I may find.

75
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,129
Who are these assistants?

76
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,006
Well, I haven't made
my final choice yet...

77
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,339
...but they'll come from a list of names
I've been assembling over several years.

78
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:43,381
- We don't want any publicity seekers.
- No, of course not.

79
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,516
These people have only been selected
after painstaking research.

80
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:50,430
They've all been involved before,
one way or another, with the abnormal.

81
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,518
I don't like the sound of that.

82
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,935
- Are any of the people on your list women?
- Some.

83
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,604
- Are you a married man?
-Yes.

84
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,693
Then your wife will be accompanying you.

85
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,858
I'm afraid not. Heh.

86
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,369
My wife disapproves of my experiments
with the supernatural.

87
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,246
She wants no part of Hill House.

88
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,375
To make sure
that everything is as it should be...

89
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,911
...suppose your nephew goes along
with Dr. Markway?

90
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,124
Luke?

91
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,750
Our young Lochinvar
from out of the Midwest. Heh.

92
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,385
I haven't much confidence
in that branch of the family.

93
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,262
Oh, in this case, I think you can.

94
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,765
Luke expects to inherit Hill House...

95
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,472
...and he'll make sure
that his property is well taken care of.

96
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,851
His property?

97
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,937
Still, it might be rather good, at that.

98
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,103
Luke hopes one day to
live off Hill House.

99
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,772
But he never dreamed
to find himself living in it.

100
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,034
Well, Harper, give Dr. Markway his lease.

101
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,569
Thank you, Mrs. Sannerson.

102
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,364
A word of warning:
Don't play gin with Luke.

103
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,032
- Oh.
-He's a cardsharp.

104
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,826
Good. That indicates a strong instinct
for self-preservation.

105
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:59,373
Exactly what do you and your assistants
expect to find at Hill House?

106
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,590
Well, maybe only a few loose floorboards,
and maybe--

107
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,801
I only say maybe.

108
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,182
--The key to another world.

109
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,746
You've just got to let me have the car.

110
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,328
There's no other way of getting there,
and I'm expected.

111
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,835
- Calm down, Eleanor.
-I've even bought some new clothes.

112
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,121
Oh, please, Bud.

113
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,712
Carrie drives the car all the time,
and I never even take it out of the garage.

114
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:46,595
- Mother--
-Mother what?

115
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,839
Nothing.

116
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,888
Nothing.

117
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:58,189
Auntie Nell is blinking.
Auntie Nell is blinking.

118
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,021
Quiet, Dora.

119
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,312
Let's talk this whole thing over without
anybody getting emotional or nervous.

120
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,572
Why shouldn't I be nervous?

121
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,030
My first chance for a vacation in all my life,
and you won't let me take it.

122
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:13,038
There's a very good reason Mother was afraid
for you to go anywhere, and it still applies.

123
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,826
We're not gonna dig up
the family skeleton again, are we?

124
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,578
I think you should
have a vacation, Nell.

125
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:23,374
Nobody knows better than me what you went
through during your mother's illness.

126
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,544
Dirty laundry, the smell
of that sickroom...

127
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,508
- Talk about mean old ladies.
-Bud.

128
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,093
Let the dead rest in peace.

129
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,803
- Oh...
-It's half my car.

130
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,934
I helped pay for it,
and I mean to take it.

131
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,936
We don't know where you're going, do we?

132
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,644
You haven't seen fit to
tell us anything, have you?

133
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,524
No, you may not have the car.

134
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,311
You know, what beats me is why
you're playing this thing so cozy...

135
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,150
...like this was a
jailbreak or something.

136
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,816
In any case, Eleanor, I'm sure I'm doing
what Mother would have thought best.

137
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,032
Although I don't suppose poor Mother's
wishes mean very much to you.

138
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,079
Get out. Get out, both of you.

139
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:01,586
Now just a minute, young lady.
You happen to be in my living room.

140
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:05,419
I happen to be in my bedroom, and I
pay a good part of your rent for it.

141
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,756
Now get out before I show you
what my nerves can really do!

142
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,258
Come on, Carrie. Dora.

143
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,884
Besides, how do I know you'll bring
back my car in good condition?

144
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,848
Oh, come on.

145
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,035
- Yeah?
- I want my car.

146
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,248
I mean to take it.

147
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,004
- Which?
-The Fredericks' car.

148
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,799
- You ain't Mrs. Fredericks.
-it's half mine.

149
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,963
- Who are you?
-Her sister, Miss Lance.

150
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,510
Look, here's my driver's license...

151
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,974
...here's my library card...

152
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,562
...and here's a blood-donor card.

153
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,319
All the same address as my sister's.
I live with her.

154
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:12,858
- Front row, left of the far pillar.
-Thank you.

155
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,668
"Very happy that you'll be joining us
in Hill House.

156
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,053
Take U.S. 50 from Boston...

157
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:38,217
...and watch for the
turnoff onto Route 238."

158
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,808
<i>Route</i> 238.

159
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,474
<i>At last I am going someplace
where I'm expected...</i>

160
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,768
<i>...and where I'm being given shelter.</i>

161
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,437
<i>And I shall never have to come back.</i>

162
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,981
<i>I hope, I hope, I hope...</i>

163
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,617
<i>...this is what I've been
waiting for all my life.</i>

164
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,660
<i>I'm going. I'm really going.</i>

165
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,451
<i>I've finally taken a step.</i>

166
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,091
<i>By now they know the car is gone...</i>

167
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,632
<i>...but they don't know where.</i>

168
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,802
<i>They would never have
suspected it of me.</i>

169
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,347
<i>I would never have
suspected it of myself.</i>

170
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,857
<i>I'm a new person.</i>

171
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,575
<i>Someday, someday...</i>

172
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:49,087
<i>...someday I'll have an apartment
of my own...</i>

173
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:54,714
<i>...in a house with a pair of stone lions
guarding the gate.</i>

174
00:13:55,877 --> 00:14:00,098
<i>I might just stop anywhere
and never leave again.</i>

175
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,724
<i>Or I might drive on and on...</i>

176
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:05,228
<i>...until the wheels of the car
are worn to nothing...</i>

177
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,139
<i>...and I've come to
the end of the world.</i>

178
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,690
<i>I wonder if all homeless
people feel that way.</i>

179
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,273
<i>I wonder what Dr. Markway is like.</i>

180
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,575
<i>I wonder who else will be there.</i>

181
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,029
<i>I wonder what Hill House is like.</i>

182
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,757
Well...

183
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,091
Well.

184
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,773
- What do you want?
-I want to come in, please.

185
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,034
- Please unlock the gates.
-Who says?

186
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,786
Well, I'm supposed to come in. I'm expected.

187
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:07,074
- Who by?
-Dr. Markway.

188
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,288
- You'd better come back later.
-Oh, please.

189
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,952
I'm one of Dr. Markway's guests.

190
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:14,043
He's expecting me in the house.
Please listen to me.

191
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,923
Well, he can't rightly
be expecting you...

192
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,427
...seeing as you're the only one
who's come so far.

193
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,595
You mean that there's
no one in the house?

194
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,303
No one you'd want to see.

195
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,475
- What did you say your name was?
-Eleanor Lance.

196
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,685
And I am expected in Hill House.

197
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:36,354
- Unlock those gates at once.
-All right, all right.

198
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,990
Suppose you know what you're asking for,
coming here.

199
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,368
Suppose they told you back in the city.

200
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,965
You seem to be the one who's afraid.

201
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,305
You'll be sorry I ever opened the gate.

202
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,221
Out of the way, please.
You've held me up long enough.

203
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,061
- Are you Dudley, the caretaker?
-Yeah, I'm Dudley, the caretaker.

204
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,941
- I shall report you.
-Huh.

205
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,148
Think they can find anyone else
to stay around here?

206
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,190
Think we can't have things
just about the way we want, me and the wife...

207
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,483
...as long as we stay around here,
see to the house...

208
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,950
...for all you city people
think you know everything?

209
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,862
<i>It's staring at me.</i>

210
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,828
<i>Vile. Vile.</i>

211
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,541
<i>Get away from here. Get away at once.</i>

212
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,708
<i>It's my chance. I'm being
given a last chance.</i>

213
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,876
<i>I could turn my car around
and go away from here...</i>

214
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,295
<i>...and no one would blame me.</i>

215
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,180
<i>Anyone has a right to run away.</i>

216
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,684
<i>But you are running away, Eleanor...</i>

217
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,561
<i>...and there's nowhere else to go.</i>

218
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,105
<i>It's waiting for me.</i>

219
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,605
<i>Evil, patient...</i>

220
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,069
<i>...waiting.</i>

221
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,759
Mrs. Dudley?

222
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:52,091
I'm Eleanor Lance. I'm expected.

223
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,039
Um, can you take me to my room?

224
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,684
I gather I'm the first one here, Mrs. Dudley.

225
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,685
You did say you were Mrs. Dudley?
I met your hue--

226
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,995
<i>Talk about being scared of your own shadow.</i>

227
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,576
<i>Pull yourself together.</i>

228
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,915
Here.

229
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,591
This is your room.

230
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,135
How nice.

231
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,971
I can't keep the rooms the way I'd like...

232
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,887
...but there's no one else they could get
that would help me.

233
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,977
How very nice.

234
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,064
I set dinner
on the dining room sideboard at 6.

235
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,853
I clear up in the morning.

236
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,239
I have breakfast for you at 9.
I don't wait on people.

237
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:35,485
I don't stay after I set out the dinner.

238
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,528
Not after it begins to get dark.

239
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,907
I leave before the dark comes.

240
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,120
Your husband?

241
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,377
- We live over in town, miles away.
-Yes.

242
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,583
So there won't be anyone around
if you need help.

243
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:50,796
- I understand.
-We couldn't hear you in the night.

244
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,670
- Do you have any idea when Dr. Mark--?
-No one could.

245
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,222
No one lives any nearer than town.

246
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,976
- No one will come any nearer than that.
-I know.

247
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,433
In the night...

248
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,018
...in the dark.

249
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:35,591
<i>I'm like a small creature
swallowed whole by a monster...</i>

250
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:39,098
<i>...and the monster
feels my tiny movements inside.</i>

251
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,267
<i>Now, Eleanor Lance, you just stop it.</i>

252
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,261
I set dinner on the--

253
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,429
Thank heavens somebody's here.

254
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,941
Oh. My name's Eleanor Lance.
I'm so glad you're here.

255
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,319
I'm Theodora. Just Theodora.

256
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,150
What about this crazy house?

257
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,280
I'm right next door.
We have a connecting bath.

258
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,316
This one used to be the embalming room,
I bet.

259
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,826
It was terrible being here alone.

260
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,329
- I set dinner on the sideboard at 6--
-Where's Markway?

261
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,160
I thought he'd be here before anyone else.

262
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,451
- Serve yourselves. I clear up in the morning.
-Have you known Dr. Markway long?

263
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,743
I have breakfast ready at 9.

264
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,754
- I've never met him.
-I don't stay after 6, after it begins to gets dark.

265
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:57,419
Our only contact is our correspondence
about the, uh, quote, "experiment," unquote.

266
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:58,928
I leave before the dark comes.

267
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,090
So there won't be anyone around
if you need help.

268
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,346
No one can hear you if you scream in the night.

269
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,557
Isn't that so, Mrs. Dudley?

270
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,564
No one lives any nearer than town.

271
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,067
No one will come any nearer than that...

272
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,227
...in the night...

273
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,646
...in the dark.

274
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,245
- You're frightened, Nell.
- Oh, no more.

275
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,203
Just when I thought I was all alone.

276
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,413
But how did you know
my nickname is Nell?

277
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:33,420
Well, that is the affectionate term
for Eleanor, isn't it?

278
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,503
Yes. Yes, I suppose it is.

279
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,463
What a nice way of putting it.

280
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:41,300
The affectionate term for Theodora is Theo.

281
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,089
Theo.

282
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,098
We're going to be great friends, Theo.

283
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,764
Like sisters?

284
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,642
Listen, there's no need
to hang around our rooms.

285
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,431
- Let's go exploring.
-Oh, I'd like to.

286
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:56,444
Why don't you put on one of your new things?
Something that'll stand out.

287
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,697
I think it's a good idea around here
to always remain strictly visible.

288
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,859
Ha, ha. Be ready in a jiffy.

289
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,277
How did you know I brought new clothes?

290
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,993
You wear your thoughts on your sleeve.

291
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,283
Anyway, that's better than my heart.

292
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:27,633
<i>How did I get into this? Why am I here?</i>

293
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,643
<i>What nightmares are waiting?</i>

294
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:30,849
Damn it.

295
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,685
I still say one of these doors
should lead to the main hall.

296
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,315
Any lights near you, Nell?

297
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,315
Nell.

298
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,651
It helps if you make a game of it.

299
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:45,409
- Pretend this is hide-and-seek.
-But we're still lost.

300
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,452
Yes.

301
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:51,828
That passageway.
We haven't tried that one yet.

302
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,668
What's the matter?

303
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,834
There's something with us.

304
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,174
I don't see anything.

305
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,882
- Can't you feel it?
-No.

306
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,555
I feel a chill.

307
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:10,014
-It's moving.
-it's just the air rushing past our ears.

308
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,052
No.

309
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,017
Then who?

310
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,024
What?

311
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,105
The house.

312
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,361
It's alive.

313
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,614
<i>She didn't hear that.</i>

314
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,750
<i>Nobody heard it but me.</i>

315
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,256
It wants you, Nell.

316
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,550
The house is calling you.

317
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:55,855
<i>I've waited such a long time.
Is this what I came so far to find?</i>

318
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,603
Don't let me go! Theo, stay with me!

319
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,657
You wouldn't believe this,
but five minutes ago I left this door open...

320
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,193
...so you could find your way.

321
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,202
It closed by itself.

322
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,118
Welcome to Hill House.
I'm Dr. Markway.

323
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:18,457
Oh, thank goodness. Thank goodness.
I thought you might be a ghost.

324
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,872
- How do you know I'm not?
-Don't be ghoulish.

325
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:24,713
Now, now, you mustn't confuse
ghoulish and ghostly.

326
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,503
The word "ghoulish"
is used to describe a feeling of horror...

327
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,546
...often accompanied by intense cold.

328
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,091
It has nothing to do with ghosts.
Ghosts are a visible thing.

329
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,978
- Enough of that. Get us out of here fast.
-What's the matter?

330
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,980
Well, let's just say we're scared of the dark.

331
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,518
I, too, go in mortal terror of the dark.

332
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,022
- I'm Theodora.
-Well, then you must be Eleanor.

333
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,815
I'm unsure at the moment.

334
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:51,201
- If it turns out you're not, I'll be disappointed.
-Oh. All right.

335
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,456
It's Theo who's wearing velvet,
so I must be Eleanor in tweed.

336
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,661
Good.

337
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:59,577
Follow me and I'll lead you
through the uncharted waste of Hill House.

338
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,791
Dinner's waiting.

339
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,802
- Do you like it?
-Oh, lovely. What do you call this?

340
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,634
The Purple Parlor.

341
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,720
We're gonna use this as the operating room.

342
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,886
I mean the center of operations.

343
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,555
-It's not very cheerful.
-Oh, I don't know.

344
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,974
There's nothing more cozy
than an old gargoyle...

345
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,893
...except maybe a whipping post or two.

346
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:27,154
This house does have its little oddities.

347
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,610
The man who built it was a misfit...

348
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,775
...who hated people
and their conventional ideas.

349
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:35,412
He built his house to suit his mind.

350
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:39,792
For instance,
all the doors are hung slightly off-center.

351
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,749
Probably explains why
they keep swinging shut by themselves.

352
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,208
Watch.

353
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,173
Now watch this.

354
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,097
Yeah, well, what did I tell you?

355
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:59,763
Anyway, all the angles are slightly off.
There isn't a square corner in the place.

356
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,772
No wonder it's impossible
to find your way around.

357
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,650
Add up all these wrong angles...

358
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,608
...and you get one big distortion
in the house as a whole.

359
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,864
Clever, Eleanor. You catch on fast.

360
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,867
I'm hungry-

361
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,903
- Let's go.
-Mm, sorry.

362
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,821
In the psychic world, we're apt to forget...

363
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:20,867
...that food is still the main concern
of poor old Homo <i>sapiens.</i>

364
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:25,712
Ah. You see? Closed by itself.

365
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:30,042
To the right, ladies.

366
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,472
Now, which door?

367
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,016
- That one.
- Wrong.

368
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,102
I've studied a map, it's this one.

369
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:50,271
- This proves it. One of you is a witch.
-A broom closet.

370
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,190
If you can't find your way around,
how will we ever?

371
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:56,952
All these doors.
it makes me think of the lady and the tiger.

372
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,989
Well, let's see if there's a tiger
behind this one.

373
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,203
- Ah.
-on.

374
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,589
Well, that's funny.

375
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,216
- No tiger?
- Listen.

376
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,391
What's wrong? Too much Vermouth?

377
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,188
Nothing that serious.

378
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:30,649
And please, please,
no cracks about my passion for spirits.

379
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,405
If you two are the ghostly inhabitants
of Hill House...

380
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,440
...I must confess I'm glad I came.

381
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,736
Eleanor, Theo, it has taken 60 million years...

382
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,997
...to develop the carnivorous biped
you see before you.

383
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,284
- Luke Sannerson.
-Let's see what kind of martinis it makes.

384
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,579
They should be pretty good.
I majored in them in college.

385
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:52,466
Are we to expect any more
carnivorous bipeds, Dr. Markway?

386
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,127
Originally, there were six committed
to the experiment...

387
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,638
...but one by one the others dropped out.

388
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,016
I suppose they were frightened
by the various unsavory stories...

389
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,051
...about the house.

390
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,887
You're the only ones left.

391
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,274
- What stories?
-You didn't investigate before you came here?

392
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:10,900
No.

393
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,190
So much the better.

394
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,902
You should be innocent and receptive.

395
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:21,161
- So let's drink to our success, huh?
-Success?

396
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,699
And just how do you reckon success
in a junket like this, doc?

397
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:27,334
I'd like to drink to, uh...

398
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,041
To just us, good companions.

399
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,625
Excellent.

400
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,834
To my new companion.

401
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,971
Except... Except I don't drink.

402
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,924
Well...

403
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,514
- Well, I think I'll have some more salmon.
-Palissy.

404
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,398
- Yeah? How much is it worth?
-Plenty.

405
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,481
Haven't seen Palissy outside of a museum.

406
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,817
I'll take a pair of Késtle skis for them
any day of the week.

407
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,574
I wonder how much I'll be able to get
for this New England fossil.

408
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:03,579
Don't ever let Mrs. Dudley hear you saying that.
At the moment, she's giving us the best.

409
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:08,243
Mm. I'm a simple fellow myself,
easily satisfied by the best of everything.

410
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,536
Including, I hope,
some startling events to come.

411
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,376
Exactly what do you expect to happen,
Dr. Markway?

412
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,508
- John.
-Yes, what is the matter with Hill House?

413
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,260
What's going to happen? Why are we here?

414
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:23,390
Well, like so many other people
through the ages...

415
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,346
...I've been intrigued by the supernatural...

416
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:28,683
...or rather,
the possibility of the supernatural.

417
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,189
I'm here in hopes of proving its existence.

418
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:34,693
You're here to keep track of what happens
and take notes for an authenticated record.

419
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,650
- Okay. But why us?
-Well, it's no accident.

420
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:41,363
You're what's left of a select company
chosen with great care.

421
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,573
I combed the records of psychic societies...

422
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:47,080
...the back numbers of newspapers,
reports of parapsychologists...

423
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:51,710
...in the hope of finding people who've been
touched in some way by the supernatural.

424
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:55,418
It's my belief that the very presence
of people like yourselves in this house...

425
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,709
...will help to stimulate the strange forces
at work here.

426
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,128
Charming thought, to be used as live bait.

427
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,093
I'm here because I'm a wolf
in ghost's clothing.

428
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:08,348
Well, I'm not really running
a psychic beauty contest.

429
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,762
You're here, Theo...

430
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,681
...because of your remarkable powers
of extrasensory perception.

431
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,768
Oh, ESP, huh? Don't believe in it.

432
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,652
Oh, Theo's a champ.

433
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:21,361
Her name shines in the annals
of Duke University's Psychic Lab...

434
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:26,825
...where she identified 19 out of 20 cards
held up out of sight and hearing.

435
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,874
But I've never had anything to do
with the supernatural.

436
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:34,502
Yes, you have, Eleanor.
Your poltergeist experience.

437
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,334
What's a poltergeist?

438
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:40,342
- A playful ghost, isn't that right, Nell?
-I wouldn't know.

439
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,670
According to the records
of the International Psychic Society...

440
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:47,717
...showers of stones fell on your house
for three days when you were 10 years old.

441
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:48,930
That's ridiculous.

442
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:53,768
It was witnessed by your family,
the neighbors, sightseers and the police.

443
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,230
In fact, it's the only case
ever officially recorded by the police.

444
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,520
It never happened.

445
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,484
Perhaps not, if you say so.

446
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,321
I only mention it because that's the reason
why I wanted you in Hill House.

447
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:06,906
Hey, look, doc, level with us, huh?

448
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,742
I mean, you're a college prof,
a man with a PhD.

449
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:13,159
You can't really believe there's such a thing
as a haunted house.

450
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:16,795
Anyway, I wish you'd stop referring
to this desirable property as haunted-.

451
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,580
There's that word "haunted" again.

452
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:22,297
Makes me expect
to find a disembodied hand in the sauce.

453
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:25,463
Nobody knows even
why some houses are called haunted.

454
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:28,223
What would you call this place?
Fun-o-rama?

455
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:33,475
No. Diseased, sick, crazy if you like.

456
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:37,107
"A deranged house"
isn't a bad way of putting it.

457
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,860
Your aunt thinks
that maybe Hill House was born bad.

458
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,114
Such houses are described
in the Bible as leprous...

459
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,741
...or before that,
in Homer's phrase for the underworld:

460
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,368
A house of Hades.

461
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,325
Aw, come off it, doc.

462
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:53,491
Really, the local mayor
makes more sense to me.

463
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:56,285
He claims the disturbances are caused
by subterranean waters...

464
00:33:56,451 --> 00:34:00,831
...or electric currents, atmospheric pressure,
sunspots, earth tremors, etcetera.

465
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:04,922
Sure, people always wanna put an easy label
on things even if it's meaningless.

466
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,554
"The trouble with Hill House is sunspots."

467
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,261
Well, there's an explanation
you don't have to think twice about.

468
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,972
And it has a scientific ring.

469
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,307
That was the neighbors.
They threw the rocks.

470
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,770
Mother says they were always against us
because she wouldn't mix with them.

471
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,058
Mother says...

472
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,067
Oh, dear.

473
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,950
That's all right, Eleanor.

474
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:32,704
- Go on. What does your mother say?
-Nothing.

475
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:36,162
I must be more tired than I thought.

476
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,543
My mother died two months ago.

477
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,420
You weren't sorry when it happened...

478
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,090
...were you?

479
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,672
No. She wasn't very happy.

480
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,671
Then I won't say I'm sorry now.

481
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,886
Eleanor, if I'd known,
I'd never have asked you to come here.

482
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,302
But I'm grateful you did. I had to get away.

483
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:59,063
- Well, perhaps you should--
- Oh, please, let's talk about something else.

484
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,441
Oh, dear.

485
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:07,773
Hey, doc, see that? Now, what about that?
Does salt work against the supernatural?

486
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,991
The Montusi bushmen thought so,
but they're extinct.

487
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,200
You see, you haven't a ghost of a chance.

488
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,385
<i>I have a place in this room.</i>

489
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,966
<i>These people are my friends.</i>

490
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:35,635
<i>I'm one of them. I belong.</i>

491
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:38,891
Gin.

492
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,397
Aah, it's the fifth time!

493
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,728
- Five times in a row.
-Twelve dollars, please.

494
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,144
- You're lucky it isn't stained.
-Oh, no, that's all right.

495
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,484
But the upholstery on the couch.
I have some cleaning fluid upstairs.

496
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:49,864
Pay up, Luke. Cash on the line.

497
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,196
Over my dead body.
You knew every card I had in my hand.

498
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,111
- Come on.
-There's a name for that, you know.

499
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,120
If you mean cheating, I don't have to.

500
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,202
Okay, Miss ESP,
so go dream yourself up 12 bucks.

501
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:00,709
Oh, pay up, you welsher.
I won fair and I want my money.

502
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,088
- What was it?
- Oh. I had a feeling.

503
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,470
- I'm sure it was just my imagination.
- A feeling you were being watched?

504
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,427
Yes. Yes, I did.

505
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,434
The house. It watches.
it watches every move we make.

506
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,844
That's your imagination.

507
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,433
Don't be so cocksure
of everything, Luke.

508
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:25,476
A closed mind is the worst defense
against the supernatural.

509
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:29,567
You seem to think you're too civilized to need
to protect yourself against evil spirits.

510
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:33,859
But even prehistoric man had a dozen
practical methods of warding them off.

511
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,073
Some of your theories strike me
as prehistoric.

512
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:38,284
Besides, they downgrade property values.

513
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,450
Look, I know the supernatural is something
that isn't supposed to happen.

514
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,163
But it does happen.

515
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:47,547
Ghosts make the papers
along with celebrities every day of the week.

516
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,754
If it happens to you...

517
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,544
...you're liable
to have that shut door in your mind...

518
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,429
...ripped right off its hinges.

519
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,557
Now, look, doc, we're buddies, okay?
But don't try to convert me.

520
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,718
I'm trying to prepare you.

521
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,480
I think there's something going on
in this house, or I wouldn't be here.

522
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,232
What?

523
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:12,155
Don't ask me to give a name
to something which hasn't got a name.

524
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,071
I don't know.

525
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:21,289
Well, tomorrow we'll see all the place.
Now let's go to bed.

526
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:23,041
Unless anyone wants to clear out now...

527
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,293
...and not have anything more to do
with Hill House.

528
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:28,205
Not me. I hope to have plenty
to do with it someday, money-wise.

529
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,373
We couldn't leave now
even if we wanted to.

530
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,213
You mean I'm holding you prisoner?

531
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:36,846
- I mean Dudley keeps the gates locked.
-We could always break out.

532
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,929
I have a key to the gate any time you want it.

533
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,186
- I wouldn't dream of leaving.
-Thank you.

534
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,017
Adventurers all.

535
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,232
But you mustn't expect every night
to be Halloween.

536
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,860
Psychic phenomena
are subject to certain laws.

537
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,817
And just what are these laws?

538
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,607
You won't know until you break them.

539
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,242
By the way, at the end of each day...

540
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,869
...I'm gonna ask you to fill out
these forms I've mimeographed.

541
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,405
Very scientific, aren't we?

542
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:04,290
Well, the really scientific phase
won't start for a while yet.

543
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,577
First of all, we have to get orientated.

544
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:09,087
Hey, what's this?
Looks like "psy-kookiness."

545
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,588
Nothing like that wrong with me.

546
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:13,296
Psychokinesis is just the technical form...

547
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,677
...for what you'd call objects moving
by themselves.

548
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,087
Actually, they don't...

549
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:22,430
...but are moved by a force from somewhere,
which we call psychokinesis.

550
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:25,641
Oh. I see.

551
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,023
Oh, about this ghost
I can expect in my room tonight...

552
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:31,230
...tell me, is it male or female?

553
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:35,025
Well, good night, ladies, doc.

554
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:39,986
Oh, I just thought of something.
Nobody locked the front door.

555
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,370
Won't make any difference.

556
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:44,789
Oh, I see.

557
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:49,537
- Well, good night, Dr. Markway.
-John.

558
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:53,673
Good night, Theo.
Get a good rest, Eleanor. Sleep well.

559
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:57,837
I'll turn the lights off below,
in case you wonder who did it.

560
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,844
If you feel in the least bit nervous,
just run right into my room, then.

561
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,849
Thanks. Good night.

562
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,223
I'll come in for a second.

563
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:09,811
You've been thinking of changing your hair,
and I know just the style for you.

564
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:13,773
Why, yes, I was. But I'm awfully tired.

565
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:17,940
- Thanks anyhow.
-Okay. We have a date for breakfast.

566
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,200
Good night, Theo.

567
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,345
<i>Funny, every/thing's so ugly
and yet so comfortable.</i>

568
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,397
<i>Like drowning, I guess.</i>

569
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:59,314
<i>Now I can think about them. I'm all alone.</i>

570
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,743
<i>Alone.</i>

571
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:17,044
<i>He won't know I locked it.</i>

572
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:23,388
<i>Against what, Eleanor? Against what?</i>

573
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,164
All right, Mother, all right.

574
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,250
Just a minute. I'm coming.

575
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,889
- Nell!
- What? What, Theo?

576
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,554
- Nell, in here!
- Oh.

577
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,688
I'm here. What is it?

578
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,860
- What is it?
-I thought it was you pounding.

579
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:26,401
It was. I mean, I did.

580
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,286
But now it's down
near the other end of the hall.

581
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,744
<i>It's not at all like Mother knocking on the wall.</i>

582
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:40,837
<i>It's only a noise,
and the room is terribly cold.</i>

583
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,422
<i>Terribly, terribly cold.</i>

584
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,297
It must be Luke and Dr. Markway.

585
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,386
Why should they be knocking on the walls?

586
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:52,553
Well, something is.
Anyway, it's only a noise.

587
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,972
Earth tremors?

588
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:17,370
Maybe it'll go down
on the other side of the hall.

589
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,445
"No!

590
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:57,584
Go away! Go away! Go away!

591
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,376
Now I've done it.

592
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:06,884
<i>It was looking for the room
with someone inside.</i>

593
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:16,352
Oh. You big baby.

594
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:19,355
Whatever it is, it's just a noise.

595
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,892
- I'm cold.
-So am I.

596
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,732
- Where's Luke? Where's Markway?
-I don't know.

597
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:28,023
- Warmer now?
-No.

598
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:31,784
In a minute, I'll go out in the hall and call them.
Are you all right?

599
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,279
Oh, God, Nell!

600
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:40,376
It's against the top of the door!

601
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,221
<i>It's found us.</i>

602
00:43:56,384 --> 00:44:01,015
<i>Now I know why people scream,
because I think I'm going to.</i>

603
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,771
-ls the door locked?
-Huh?

604
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,651
No.

605
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,277
You can't get in!

606
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:21,974
It's over.

607
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,352
- How do you know?
-Can't you feel it?

608
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:28,984
Aren't you warm again?
That terrible cold has gone.

609
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,986
Why, yes.

610
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:34,866
Intense cold is one of the symptoms of shock.
My mother--

611
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:38,779
Intense shock
is one of the symptoms I've got.

612
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,503
Where have you two been?

613
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:49,960
What's the matter?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

614
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,499
Did anything happen?

615
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:08,058
No. Nothing in particular.

616
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,904
Just something knocked on the door
with a cannonball...

617
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,280
...then tried to get in and eat us.

618
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,817
I'm with Nell.

619
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,988
Miss ESP and Bridey Murphy,
some combination.

620
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,622
- There isn't a scratch on the wood.
-Or anywhere else.

621
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,121
How nice it didn't mar the woodwork.

622
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,418
Where were you, Dr. Markway?

623
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:33,833
Chasing a dog.

624
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,469
At least, we assumed it was a dog.

625
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,924
We followed it outside.

626
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:42,513
You mean...? You mean it was inside?

627
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:45,098
I thought I heard something
run past my room.

628
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,730
I woke Luke, and we went looking for it
all over the house...

629
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,390
...and finally out in the garden.

630
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:52,777
But let's face it, girls,
we didn't get very far from the house.

631
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:56,360
Then you must have heard
that ungodly noise.

632
00:46:56,522 --> 00:47:00,072
No, there wasn't a sound from the house.

633
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,408
At least, nothing audible to us.

634
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:10,119
- We'd better take precautions.
- Against what?

635
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:13,836
Well, when Luke and I are decoyed outside...

636
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,217
...and you two are bottled up inside...

637
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:20,221
...wouldn't you say that something,
somehow, is trying to separate us?

638
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,749
Good morning, Dr. Markway.

639
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:52,503
- Morning, and please call me John.
-John.

640
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:57,341
- This curious life seems to agree with you.
-Oh. Thank you.

641
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,719
- Tea or coffee?
-Tea, please.

642
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,925
How do you manage to look so pretty
after last night?

643
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:03,840
Well, that was last night.

644
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,474
There may have been a little noise.

645
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:09,095
One has to expect that in these old houses.

646
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:13,141
I give up. I was sure you'd be packed
and on your way this morning.

647
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,354
Not likely.

648
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:17,316
This is my first vacation in years,
and I'm going to enjoy it.

649
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:19,572
Hmm, that's the point.
You need a real vacation.

650
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:23,325
- This isn't the place for one.
-I mean to stay, period.

651
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:25,532
Unless, of course, you want to get rid of me.

652
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,992
No, no, you mustn't think that.

653
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,499
Till last night,
you werejust a name on my list.

654
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:32,535
I scarcely know Eleanor Lance.

655
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:36,001
- Oh. She's horrible.
-No, no, you mustn't make fun of me.

656
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,791
You're sweet and pleasant,
and everyone likes you very much.

657
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:41,802
- I wanna know more about you.
-Oh.

658
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:46,808
I dislike lobster,
crack my knuckles when I'm nervous...

659
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:50,266
...save buttons, and sleep on my left side.

660
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:52,271
Hmm? Why on the left side?

661
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:55,855
I read someplace
it wears the heart out quicker.

662
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,152
Well, that's a depressing thought.

663
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:03,149
For the past 11 years,
I've been walled up alive on a desert island.

664
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,865
Oh, I thought you might be hiding
some dark romantic secret in your past.

665
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,155
Romantic?

666
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:13,201
I've spent all my adult life
taking care of my invalid mother...

667
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,869
...until she died.

668
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,413
No, it wasn't romantic.

669
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:21,380
Well, now that you're free at last, you shouldn't
be wasting your time in Hill House.

670
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:23,920
- It's a mistake.
-But it isn't, don't you see?

671
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,508
The only thing that kept me going...

672
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,766
...was that someday
I knew something would happen.

673
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:33,020
Something truly extraordinary,
like Hill House.

674
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:35,932
Hmm. It's extraordinary.

675
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,685
What will you do when you get back?
Do you have a job?

676
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:42,230
No, no job, nothing.
I don't know what I'm going to do.

677
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,240
You wouldn't send me back, would you?

678
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:48,494
Well, that depends on what happens.

679
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:52,494
We may all have to go back.
But I won't give up easily.

680
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:56,331
How did you get so interested
in the supernatural?

681
00:49:56,494 --> 00:50:00,920
I didn't want to become
what my father called a practical man.

682
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,800
I come from one of those
respectable English families...

683
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:07,213
...that dragged all the Victorian virtues
into the 20th century.

684
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,302
In a Gladstone bag, of course.

685
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:11,968
Everything had to be practical
and conventional.

686
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,477
So naturally, my first reaction...

687
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:16,435
...was to choose something useless
and unconventional, like ghosts.

688
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:18,520
But you're an anthropologist now.

689
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:22,186
Mm. When I refused to read law at Oxford
as my father had...

690
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,230
...there was a terrific row.

691
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:27,024
I took off for America,
without my Gladstone bag...

692
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:29,193
...and worked my way through college.

693
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,362
I decided on anthropology
because it seemed to me...

694
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,577
...to be a short step
from the study of dead souls...

695
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,913
...to the study of dead men
and dead civilizations.

696
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:38,919
I'm not very practical, either.

697
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:41,797
Hmm. But it didn't occur to me
till I was hooked...

698
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:45,130
...that my combined knowledge
of anthropology and psychic phenomena...

699
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,795
...had led me on to something very practical.

700
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:51,512
You see, if ghosts,
which are pure spirit, come from man...

701
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:54,177
...then perhaps it's possible someday
to have individuals...

702
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:58,769
...whose spiritual caliber far surpasses
anything humanity has yet known.

703
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,147
Human nature could certainly stand
some improvements.

704
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,732
However, my idea remains pure theory...

705
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:08,445
...until somebody proves definitely
the supernatural exists.

706
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,661
Anyway, that's enough about me.
Now tell me about last night.

707
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:16,453
Thank you.
Well, I've been trying to remember.

708
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,459
I can remember knowing I was frightened...

709
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:23,589
...but I can't remember
actually being frightened or how I felt.

710
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,374
I think it's because it was so unreal.

711
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,919
Still could be subterranean waters,
you know.

712
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:31,806
I hope not.
That wouldn't be nearly so exciting.

713
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:35,302
Not good, this feeling of excitement.

714
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:38,095
It's the first sign
you've fallen under the spell of the house.

715
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:41,724
Maybe it isn't just the house.

716
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,393
Then what else?

717
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,406
Let's blame it on sunspots.

718
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:52,402
Well, it wasn't sunspots last night.

719
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:56,122
If anyone gets hurt,
it's going to be your fault, Markway.

720
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,327
Mm-hm.

721
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:01,244
No ghost in all the long history of ghosts
ever hurt anyone physically.

722
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,629
You see?
We weren't in any actual danger at all.

723
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,915
-Isn't that right, John?
-No, not entirely.

724
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:08,334
Fear alone can do the damage to the victim.

725
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,470
Prehistoric man, for instance,
could die of fright during an eclipse.

726
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:14,473
<i>- Poor sap.
-You mean poor Homo sapiens.</i>

727
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:19,012
Modern man can react
with the same unreasoning terror...

728
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:20,521
...to a supernatural event...

729
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:23,307
...especially if he doesn't believe
that the supernatural exists.

730
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:26,728
I've always been more afraid
of being left alone or left out...

731
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:29,773
...than of things that go bump in the night.

732
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:31,653
What are you afraid of, Theo?

733
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:35,361
Of knowing what I really want.

734
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:40,162
- Good morning, fellow Earthlings.
- Luke, what are you afraid of?

735
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:42,668
What I just saw in the hall.

736
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:46,456
-Is there something?
-You mean you haven't seen it?

737
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,796
Well, the show's just getting good. Come on.

738
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,882
Right here.

739
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:02,226
-It's writing?
-Writing.

740
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,025
Chalk.

741
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,322
Or something like chalk.

742
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,454
- Can you read it?
-No.

743
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,164
"Help.

744
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,622
Eleanor...

745
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:31,008
...come home."

746
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,543
What?

747
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:37,089
"Eleanor."
Oh, no.

748
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:40,135
Wipe it off, please. It's crazy.

749
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:42,553
"Crazy" is the word for it, all right.

750
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,769
- Get something and wipe it off, Luke.
-But it's crazy. Why?

751
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,184
Why all the fuss?
it spelled her name right, didn't it?

752
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,944
- It spelled out my name.
- Take it easy.

753
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:54,027
It's my name.
it belongs to me, and something is using it.

754
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,237
- Listen to me--
-Writing it, calling me with my name!

755
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,993
- Just because your name--
-That's it!

756
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:01,072
It knows my name, doesn't it?

757
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,491
- It knows my name!
- Simmer down, Nell.

758
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,160
It could have said any of us.
It knows all our names.

759
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:09,500
Did you write it? Please tell me.
I won't be angry or anything.

760
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,882
I just want to know so that...

761
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,168
Maybe it was only for a joke
to frighten me.

762
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,712
You know none of us wrote it, baby.

763
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,719
- She's lying. I could swear she did it.
-Easy, Eleanor, easy.

764
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,008
I clear breakfast at 10:00.

765
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:23,348
- Why should I wanna write your name?
-I set lunch at 1.

766
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,478
I didn't wait to have breakfast with you.

767
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,685
- That's the way I agreed to.
-You're way out, baby.

768
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,441
You don't know Theo as I'm beginning to.

769
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,648
- I clear up at 10.
- Mrs. Dudley, please!

770
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:35,030
- Nobody blames you for being upset.
-it's 10:00.

771
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:36,907
Why me? Why should I be the one chosen?

772
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,534
Maybe something in the house
finds you a kindred spirit.

773
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:43,197
Maybe it thinks you have more understanding
and sympathy than the rest of us.

774
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,956
Hmm. Maybe you wrote it yourself.

775
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,914
Oh, sure, I'm just the kind
to want to see my name...

776
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,623
...scribbled all over this foul house.

777
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:52,131
Well, it's one way to attract attention, isn't it?

778
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,758
You think I like the idea
I'm the center of attention?

779
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:58,137
Why are you all done up
in that new hairstyle?

780
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,223
You...

781
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,975
- You suggested I change my hair.
- That's enough, Eleanor.

782
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,306
How dare you? How dare you?

783
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:06,516
Can't you see, Eleanor...

784
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:09,602
...Theo's just trying to get a rise out of you
so you won't be frightened?

785
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:10,891
Mm-hm.

786
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,275
Oh.

787
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:15,150
I'm sorry.

788
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,280
Take Eleanor to her room, Theo.

789
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,658
We'll postpone the tour of the house
till this afternoon.

790
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:21,444
Okay, but don't forget.

791
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,112
I don't want to spend another night...

792
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,952
...wondering what's over my head
or underneath me.

793
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,794
You wouldn't leave me behind, would you?

794
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:33,251
No one will leave you behind.

795
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,681
Holy cow. Mount Rushmore.

796
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:50,599
-It's not there. I don't believe it's there.
-How?

797
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,311
I thought you'd get a kick out of it.

798
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:55,648
It's supposed to be St. Francis
curing the lepers.

799
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:57,984
- My.
-I'd say it's a family portrait.

800
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,523
A composite.

801
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:04,412
The tall, draped, masculine type,
that's old Hugh Crain...

802
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:08,370
...pointing out all of the great treasures
in this creepy house he built.

803
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:11,661
Now, the dame on the end down there
and this one must be his two wives.

804
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:13,750
His daughter, Abigail.

805
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:17,128
- Now, the dog...
- The dog you were chasing last night.

806
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:20,044
Yeah, very good.

807
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:23,131
Now, that one,
she's got to be the companion, huh?

808
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:25,675
The one who's supposed
to have murdered Abigail or something.

809
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:29,846
No, no, that was much later.
When Abigail was an old lady.

810
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:33,516
You know, I wonder how this statue got here.
it wasn't on the original inventory.

811
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:35,650
Maybe I'll break it up
and sell it for tombstones.

812
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,482
The companion reminds me of you, Nell.

813
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,442
- Oh, no.
Mm-hm.

814
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:40,902
Yeah, she does, at that.

815
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:44,367
A natural beauty, I'd call her.

816
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:48,205
<i>What does he think of me, really?</i>

817
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:50,912
<i>Am I being a fool?</i>

818
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:54,248
<i>Don't let me know too surely
what he thinks of me.</i>

819
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,630
You know,
this could be a family portrait of us.

820
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,962
- Don't be ridiculous.
-You're the companion.

821
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,878
I'm Abigail, grown up.

822
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:05,218
And Markway could be old Hugh.

823
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,099
- Where do I fit in?
-The dog.

824
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:11,224
Tell me, uh,
when are you gonna show rne your ESP?

825
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:14,139
- Keep your hands to yourself.
-What's going on?

826
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:18,064
Oh. More than meets the eye.

827
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:23,112
You know, this wouldn't be such a bad room
without the statue.

828
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,903
Oh, ideal for the zombies' annual ball.

829
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,997
Why don't you dance with Hugh, Eleanor?
I believe he has his eye on you.

830
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,908
- That's not funny.
- Don't be so chicken.

831
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:35,498
- Leave Eleanor alone.
-I'll bet she doesn't know how to dance.

832
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:37,538
I do too.

833
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:44,632
Hugh Crain, will you dance with me?

834
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:47,093
I believe he's going to accept.

835
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,608
- He moved.
-Of course.

836
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:05,775
Haven't you noticed how nothing
in this house moves until you look away...

837
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:09,787
...and then you just catch something
out of the corner of your eye?

838
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:11,822
- Ouch!
- Oh!

839
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:14,412
She stepped on my toe.

840
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:18,579
Well, let's go out this way
before somebody gets hurt.

841
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:22,420
Come over here.

842
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:25,085
I want to show you something
really unique.

843
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:37,473
A library complete with ivory tower.

844
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:40,392
Oh. I can't go in there.

845
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,108
- Eleanor?
- My mother...

846
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,442
Yes?

847
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,652
That smell...

848
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:52,037
-it's just stale air, Eleanor.
-No, no, that other smell. Awful.

849
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,702
Smells sweet to me, honey.

850
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:57,914
At 25 cents a book,
I should do all right with this room, huh?

851
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:01,880
I don't think I'll do much reading
while I'm here.

852
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:05,043
- Not if the books smell like the library.
-I didn't notice it.

853
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,006
- Oh.
-No, that's good, Eleanor.

854
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:08,716
It's just what we're after.

855
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,598
Try and remember your reaction
and describe it exactly...

856
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:13,225
...when you write your notes tonight.

857
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,635
That's what I'm here for.

858
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,805
Only, do you mind
if I skip the library for now?

859
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:21,601
No, no. Do just what you want.
We'll only be a minute.

860
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:26,438
- You're sure you're all right, huh?
-Yes.

861
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,488
Now, I want to show you something
really interesting.

862
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,407
You remember that companion,
the one Abigail had...

863
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:38,700
...when she was an old lady?

864
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:41,370
Well, you see that little balcony...

865
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:45,291
...clear up at the top there,
right up there in the shadows?

866
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,755
That's where the companion hanged herself.

867
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:50,592
- Would've been easier to jump.
- Without a parachute?

868
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:53,132
They say she tied the rope
to the railing and then--

869
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:56,643
- Thanks, we get it.
-Hey, I've just had a great idea.

870
00:59:56,802 --> 01:00:00,432
You know what I think I'll do with this room?
After I inherit the house, of course.

871
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,224
I'll turn it into a nightclub.

872
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,394
Tear out these bookshelves
and put a band in there.

873
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,608
And, oh, now comes the best part.

874
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:10,365
A whole line of beautiful chorus girls
dancing down these stairs.

875
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:11,616
Can't you see it?

876
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,998
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

877
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,659
- Quick thinking.
-instinct.

878
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:23,249
My strong instinct for self-preservation.

879
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:26,756
And, you know, it's telling me right now
loud and clear to get the hell out of here.

880
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:40,312
<i>Vile. Hideous.</i>

881
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:54,325
<i>I wonder what it would be like
looking down from there.</i>

882
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,987
<i>That's where she did it.</i>

883
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:59,248
<i>From that window.</i>

884
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:02,285
<i>Climbing out through the bars...</i>

885
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:05,124
<i>...hanging on for an instant...</i>

886
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:07,706
<i>...hanging on...</i>

887
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:13,841
Eleanor, you'll fall!

888
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:16,344
Didn't you hear me calling?

889
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:21,061
This house,
you have to watch it every minute.

890
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:24,348
Eleanor. Eleanor.

891
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:28,728
I didn't realize you were so nervous.
I really think I ought to send you home.

892
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:32,114
- Oh, no, please, I can't go home.
-It's no reflection on you.

893
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:34,115
An atmosphere like this
might break anyone down.

894
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:36,618
But I'm not breaking down.

895
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:39,950
I did hear noises last night.
Something was trying to get into the room.

896
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:49,416
You realize, don't you, that if even one,
one, event is proved to be a hallucination...

897
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:52,130
...then this whole experiment
will be questioned?

898
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:55,671
Oh. I'm not crazy, you know.

899
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:59,512
After all, Theo was there, too.
Is it my fault it just didn't make sense?

900
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,641
Well, we'll let it go for now.

901
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,399
- Maybe I'm just being selfish.
-Selfish?

902
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,814
Keeping you here
for the sake of the experiment.

903
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:17,860
Oh. Of course.
For the sake of the experiment.

904
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:20,779
You do seem to be the main attraction...

905
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,281
...for whatever's in the house.

906
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:27,794
- But I'll send you back the minute--
-Oh, no, please. I'm all right. Really, I am.

907
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:30,501
Eleanor.

908
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:33,508
Well, don't you two look cozy?

909
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:38,093
Oh. Uh, she was halfway off the veranda
when I caught her.

910
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:41,759
I was leaning back
to see the top of the tower.

911
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:45,099
- I got dizzy.
-Dizzy like a fox, huh?

912
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:52,069
Poor Nell. You look like death.
Let's go inside.

913
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,823
- Theo.
- Hmm?

914
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:58,984
I think you'd better move in with Eleanor.

915
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,787
- You're the doctor.
-Oh, but that's my room, my very own room.

916
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:07,164
Well, I wouldn't want to run the risk
of either of you spending another night alone.

917
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:10,078
-Oh--
-Don't get all hung up, Nell.

918
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:14,375
We'll have fun. Like sisters.

919
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,800
- It tickles.
- Of course.

920
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:26,435
Your toes are tickled pink.

921
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,392
I knew my shade would suit you perfectly.

922
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,567
Have another drink. It will keep the chill out.

923
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:36,401
Just a teensy one.
To keep the chill out. Ha-ha-ha.

924
01:03:36,563 --> 01:03:38,782
- I don't really like whiskey.
-This is brandy.

925
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,613
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

926
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:44,325
By the time I'm through with you, Nell,
you'll be a different person.

927
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:48,829
- Ooh. It's wicked.
-Ha, ha.

928
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,585
I mean, on my foot.

929
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:54,089
You've got foolishness
and wickedness mixed up.

930
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,090
Maybe.

931
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:59,549
Haven't had much chance
to learn the difference.

932
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:00,883
Know something?

933
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:02,764
Even when I'd play solitaire in my room...

934
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,924
...she'd bang on the wall
and make me feel guilty...

935
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:07,844
...for leaving her alone just that little bit.

936
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:10,139
- She'd always--
-Your mother?

937
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:16,315
My mother, mother, mother. Ha, ha.

938
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,947
Story of my dull life.

939
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,734
What's your apartment like?

940
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:24,744
Oh, it's an old place
we furnished ourselves...

941
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:27,122
...from a lot of stuff we picked up
in the junk shops.

942
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,453
We both love fixing over old things.

943
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:30,913
Like me.

944
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,872
You married?

945
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:38,046
No.

946
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:41,427
Oh, I'm sorry.

947
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:45,223
I'm stupid and wicked and untrustworthy...

948
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:46,850
...and not good for anything at all.

949
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:51,271
Oh, I don't think so.
Maybe just a little bit tight at the moment.

950
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,227
Tell me something about where you live.

951
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,068
Hmm.

952
01:04:57,769 --> 01:05:01,319
I haven't had it long enough
to believe it's my own.

953
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:05,611
It's a little apartment.
Smaller than yours, I'm sure.

954
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:09,281
I live alone. I'm still furnishing it.

955
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:13,827
Buying one thing at a time
to make sure I get everything absolutely right.

956
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:20,718
Took me two weeks to find
the little stone lions I keep on the mantel.

957
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:23,590
Brush their teeth every night.

958
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:27,595
I've got a hunch I better get you back
to your apartment as fast as I can.

959
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,179
- Oh, don't say that.
-I only mean--

960
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:30,844
Why do you all pick on me?

961
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:35,140
Am I the public dump or something
for everybody's fear?

962
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:42,864
I don't want to leave Hill House
ever, ever, ever.

963
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:48,112
I've been waiting all my life
for something like this to happen.

964
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:51,702
Hey, everybody, come here.
I've found something.

965
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:00,123
What's wrong with you, doc?

966
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:04,295
Stand there. Go on, stand there.
You too, girls. Stand there.

967
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:10,433
A cold spot. A genuine cold spot.

968
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:13,095
I guarantee it won't register
on any thermometer.

969
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:16,435
Oh, bunk. It's just a draft, that's all.

970
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:19,192
- Coming from somewhere.
- A draft? In Hill House?

971
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:21,736
Not unless you can make
one of the doors stay open.

972
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:26,116
No, I found it. The heart of Hill House.

973
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:28,743
You mean where we're standing?

974
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:30,950
Behind these doors.

975
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:33,285
- What's in there?
-The nursery.

976
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:36,201
Abigail Grain grew up and died there.

977
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:41,131
- Just the place to chill our beer, huh?
-No, no, don't go in there.

978
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:45,385
We'll keep the lid on the pressure cooker
a while longer, then.

979
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:46,715
Now, don't give me that, doc.

980
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:49,222
Whew. It's like the doorway to a tomb.

981
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:52,388
Bless you.

982
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,807
Now, that's enough, girls.

983
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:57,473
You'd better run along to bed
before you catch cold.

984
01:06:57,639 --> 01:07:02,110
- Yes, teacher. Bless you.
-Come on.

985
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:17,910
No, no, no. There's got to be a draft.

986
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:21,246
The floor's solid.

987
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:24,165
Look, doc, don't give me
any of that supernatural jazz.

988
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:27,211
This is something I can feel.

989
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,136
And see.

990
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:32,094
Maybe there's a pipeline
to the North Pole, huh?

991
01:07:32,257 --> 01:07:36,182
Why won't you accept it for what it is,
a supernatural phenomenon?

992
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:38,813
You knock on wood, don't you?

993
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:41,441
Yeah. What's that got to do with it?

994
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,193
It shows that even you, despite yourself...

995
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:49,324
...feel that there are forces beyond nature
able to help or hurt us.

996
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:50,574
Now, wait a minute.

997
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,781
Are you trying to tell me
belief in a superstition...

998
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:55,663
...is the same thing
as believing in the supernatural?

999
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:57,916
It's food for thought.

1000
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:04,123
Frozen food for thought.

1001
01:08:10,128 --> 01:08:11,380
You know what I think?

1002
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:14,265
Markway had us all so edgy,
we're getting the cold sweats.

1003
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:16,927
The temperature doesn't have to drop
to make you feel like that.

1004
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,470
That's right.

1005
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:21,185
Music gives me goose bumps.

1006
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:23,520
Still, there was that awful smell in the library.

1007
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:24,730
Oh, here we go again.

1008
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:27,361
You know very well
what you thought you smelled in the library.

1009
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,739
The sickroom smell.

1010
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:33,109
Let's discuss me some other time.

1011
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:35,153
I'm tired.

1012
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,789
- Turn out the light.
-No, I'd like it on. Have you seen this?

1013
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:41,668
I told you, I just want to go to sleep.
Good night.

1014
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:47,044
Well, why be mad at me?
I don't think you killed your mother.

1015
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,546
Leave me alone.

1016
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:55,966
- Okay.
-Go to sleep.

1017
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,635
Good night, Nellie, my Nell.

1018
01:09:57,402 --> 01:10:00,906
Are you awake?
Don't say a word, Theo. Not a word.

1019
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:03,791
Don't let it know you're in my room.

1020
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:28,308
Hold my hand, Theo.

1021
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:32,812
And for God's sake, don't scream.

1022
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:02,471
Is it over? Do you think it's over?

1023
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:05,182
Theo. You're breaking my hand.

1024
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:28,751
<i>This is monstrous. This is cruel.</i>

1025
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:30,207
<i>It is hurting</i> a <i>Child...</i>

1026
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:34,249
<i>...and I will not let anyone,
anything, hurt a child.</i>

1027
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:37,134
<i>I won't endure this. It thinks to scare me.</i>

1028
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,637
<i>Well, it has, and poor Theo too.</i>

1029
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:44,222
<i>Honestly, it feels like
she's breaking my hand.</i>

1030
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:54,231
<i>I will take a lot
from this filthy house for his sake...</i>

1031
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,487
<i>...but I will not go along with hurting a child.</i>

1032
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:58,569
<i>No, I will not.</i>

1033
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:05,285
<i>I will get my mouth to open right now,
and I will yell, I will yell, I will yell.</i>

1034
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:07,995
Stop it!

1035
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:15,506
What? What, Nell? What?

1036
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:23,010
Oh, God.

1037
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:26,972
Oh, God.

1038
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:31,306
Whose hand was I holding?

1039
01:12:58,624 --> 01:12:59,967
Oh, Eleanor.

1040
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:02,345
- Too bad. You just missed it.
-What?

1041
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:04,847
The Hill House concerto for harp.

1042
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:08,010
Oh? Were you playing the harp?

1043
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:09,677
It was playing itself.

1044
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:13,474
Oh. Naturally. How do you explain it?

1045
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,687
Subterranean waters? Earth tremors?

1046
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:19,946
No, as a matter of fact,
I don't think it is anything supernatural.

1047
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:21,902
The self-starting music.

1048
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:24,066
More likely it's in the realm
of the preternatural.

1049
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,280
Preternatural?

1050
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:27,946
Something we don't have
any natural explanation for right now...

1051
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:30,206
...but probably will have someday.

1052
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:35,336
The preternatural of one generation
becomes the natural of the next.

1053
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:36,620
You know, not so long ago...

1054
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:39,757
...scientists laughed at the idea
of magnetic attraction.

1055
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:44,092
They couldn't explain it,
so they refused to admit it existed.

1056
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:49,225
Life is still full of the preternatural.
My mother-- Mm.

1057
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:51,556
Go on. Say it.
You've been trying to since you got here.

1058
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:55,269
I don't know what I was going to say.
I'm still so terrified from last night.

1059
01:13:55,431 --> 01:14:00,107
- You shouldn't be. It's silly to be frightened.
-Silly? You haven't been through it.

1060
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,897
This horrible, unknown thing.

1061
01:14:03,064 --> 01:14:05,613
Unknown. That's the key word. Unknown.

1062
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:07,903
When we become involved
in a supernatural event...

1063
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:11,039
...we're scared out of our wits
just because it's unknown.

1064
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:13,074
The night cry of a child.

1065
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:16,790
A face on the wall, knockings, bangings.
What's there to be afraid of?

1066
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,000
You weren't threatened.

1067
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:20,164
It was harmless,
like a joke that doesn't come off.

1068
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:22,584
- But the child--
-There was no child. Just a voice.

1069
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,047
Oh, worse.

1070
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:27,297
Look, let me put it this way.

1071
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:30,300
When people believed the Earth was flat...

1072
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,060
...the idea of a round world scared them silly.

1073
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:35,847
Then they found out
how the round world works.

1074
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:38,482
It's the same with the world
of the supernatural.

1075
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:40,769
Until we know how it works...

1076
01:14:40,935 --> 01:14:45,111
...we'll continue to carry around
this unnecessary burden of fear.

1077
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:51,571
Supposing it is in my imagination...

1078
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:55,833
...the knocking, the voices, everything.

1079
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:59,791
Every cursed bit of the haunting.

1080
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:04,008
Suppose the haunting is all in my mind.

1081
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,215
Well, you can't say that,
because there are three other people here.

1082
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:08,721
We all resist the idea...

1083
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:12,804
...that what ran through the garden
that first night was a ghost...

1084
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:16,562
...what banged on the door was a ghost,
what held your hand was a ghost.

1085
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:19,933
But there's certainly something
going on in Hill House.

1086
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:23,103
We're getting close, Eleanor, very close,
to finding out what it is.

1087
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:26,314
I could say all three of you
are in my imagination.

1088
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,823
- None of this is real.
-Sure.

1089
01:15:27,982 --> 01:15:30,030
That's the easiest way
to dismiss the supernatural...

1090
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,490
...by pleading insanity
or accusing others of it.

1091
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:35,573
Maybe I am insane.

1092
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:38,080
My mother...

1093
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:42,588
The night my mother died...

1094
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:45,295
...she knocked on the wall.

1095
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,885
And I didn't come.

1096
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:53,342
Eleven years of looking in on her
after every small noise.

1097
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:55,259
That night...

1098
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:58,430
...my back hurt and my hands.

1099
01:15:58,596 --> 01:16:01,440
It wasn't fair.
We could've afforded a laundress.

1100
01:16:01,599 --> 01:16:04,944
I ought to have brought her the medicine.
I always did before.

1101
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:06,945
But this time...

1102
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:10,442
...she called me...

1103
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:13,031
...and I never answered.

1104
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:18,203
- Is that how a normal person acts?
-Yes.

1105
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:23,337
You were tired and disgusted.
Eleven years tired and disgusted.

1106
01:16:23,496 --> 01:16:25,248
You're human.

1107
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:28,338
Stop trying to be either a saint or a martyr.

1108
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:31,254
You probably like thinking it was your fault.

1109
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:35,053
My sister says I wanted Mother to die.

1110
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:38,932
I've wondered ever since
if I didn't wake up in the night...

1111
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:41,314
...and hear her...

1112
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:43,725
...just go back to sleep.

1113
01:16:43,891 --> 01:16:45,893
It would have been easy.

1114
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:50,110
- I've wondered about it.
-No, you're not capable of that.

1115
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:53,029
You're a fine person, Eleanor.

1116
01:16:53,192 --> 01:16:55,741
Sensitive and honest and thoroughly good.

1117
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:02,209
- Do you really think so, John?
-I do indeed.

1118
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:07,381
Oh. Goose bumps.

1119
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:12,337
There isn't by any chance a cold spot
in this room too, is there?

1120
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:14,756
No, there isn't.

1121
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:19,844
Eleanor...

1122
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:34,200
<i>Journeys end in lovers meeting.</i>

1123
01:17:35,109 --> 01:17:38,033
<i>All I want is to be cherished.</i>

1124
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:41,825
<i>And here we are
listening to that ridiculous harp.</i>

1125
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:47,205
"Lust. Daughter, preserve thyself.

1126
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:52,885
Hold apart from this world,
that its lust corrupt thee not.

1127
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:57,056
Could you but hear for a moment
the agony...

1128
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:59,637
...the screaming--"

1129
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,973
Oh, now, get this, congregation.

1130
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:04,685
"--The dreadful crying out of the lustful...

1131
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:08,602
...damned for eternity in everlasting flame."

1132
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:11,145
- What have you got there?
- I found it at the library.

1133
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:13,064
He made it himself.

1134
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:18,532
<i>Look. "Memories for Abigail Lester Crain:
A Legacy for her Education and Enlightenment.</i>

1135
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,742
From her devoted father,
Hugh Desmond Lester Crain...

1136
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:23,408
...Hill House, 21st October, 1873."

1137
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:28,538
- But that's today.
-No, tomorrow and 9O years later.

1138
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,251
Some nursery book, huh?

1139
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:34,843
“Honor the authors of thy being, daughter.

1140
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:38,176
Thy father and thy mother."

1141
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:42,347
Just the thing to give a child at bedtime.
No family should be without one.

1142
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:46,685
I can see him now spitting out the words
so they take root in her little mind.

1143
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:52,061
Hugh Crain, you were a dirty man,
and you made a dirty house.

1144
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:54,481
And if you can hear me,
I'm telling you to your face...

1145
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:57,821
...I hope you spend eternity
in that foul, rotten book...

1146
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,862
...and never stop burning for a minute.

1147
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:08,623
- Don't be a bore, Nell. Sit down and we'll--
-Oh, leave me alone.

1148
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:11,130
Oh, you are a bore.

1149
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:12,961
I've got it. I'll tear out the pictures...

1150
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:16,502
...and send them as Christmas cards
to my New England relatives, huh? Ha, ha.

1151
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:19,593
I think it's funny. "Dear Uncle Ned:
Merry Christmas. May your soul rot--"

1152
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:23,350
Close up that book, Luke.
It's enough to set anyone's nerves on edge.

1153
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:26,513
Oh, it's not the book
that's making our Nell nervous.

1154
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:29,603
She's worried about her apartment.

1155
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:32,230
I didn't know.
ls there anything I can do to help?

1156
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:33,770
She thinks she's being funny.

1157
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:36,359
Tell me, Dr. Markway,
are you fond of stone lions...

1158
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:38,365
...the kind you keep on the mantel?

1159
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:39,696
Shut up, Theo.

1160
01:19:39,858 --> 01:19:42,828
Do you long for a tiny home,
something smaller than Hill House?

1161
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:45,035
There's room for two, isn't there, Nell?

1162
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:49,998
You're a monster, Theo.
You're the monster of Hill House.

1163
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:55,920
- You'd better go with her.
-Wouldn't you rather?

1164
01:19:56,083 --> 01:20:00,088
I said, go with her.
She shouldn't be left in that room alone.

1165
01:20:06,844 --> 01:20:08,892
Here you are. Okay, Isolde.

1166
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:10,977
- Tristan wants you inside.
-Leave me alone.

1167
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:12,813
Stop trying to be the center of attention.

1168
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:14,727
- Come inside.
-You revolt me.

1169
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,526
Well. Can't you take a joke?

1170
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:20,487
I didn't know you were
serious about Markway.

1171
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,947
- Of course you did.
-Okay.

1172
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:25,078
But he shouldn't be allowed
to get away with it.

1173
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,989
Get away with what?

1174
01:20:27,156 --> 01:20:30,911
- You're making a fool of yourself over him.
-Suppose I'm not, though.

1175
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:33,955
You'd mind terribly if you turned out
to be wrong for once, wouldn't you?

1176
01:20:34,121 --> 01:20:39,378
- Oh, you poor stupid innocent.
-I'd rather be innocent than like you.

1177
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:40,886
Meaning what?

1178
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:43,764
Now who's being stupid and innocent?

1179
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:47,597
- You know perfectly well what I mean.
-Is this another of your crazy hallucinations?

1180
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,888
- I'm not crazy.
-Crazy as a loon.

1181
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:52,978
You expect me to believe you're sane
and the rest of the world is mad?

1182
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:57,691
Why not?
The world is full of inconsistencies.

1183
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:59,321
Unnatural things.

1184
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:03,326
"Nature's mistakes," they're called.
You, for instance.

1185
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:21,002
- Grace.
-A reporter's been telephoning all day.

1186
01:21:21,168 --> 01:21:22,215
He's on your track.

1187
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:24,551
- He's heard about you renting this place.
-Who told him?

1188
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,715
The Dudleys, I bet.
They must have blabbed in town.

1189
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,634
Come back with me now, John, please.

1190
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:31,805
If they find out why you're here,
the papers will have a field day with you.

1191
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:33,768
Who are you?

1192
01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:36,150
Grace Markway.

1193
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:38,731
Didn't John tell you he's married?

1194
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,647
- I tried to warn you.
- Well, welcome to our party.

1195
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:43,907
Well, who are you?

1196
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:46,945
We're, uh, researchers in the field
of psychic phenomena.

1197
01:21:47,111 --> 01:21:49,455
Grace, please go.
You couldn't have arrived at a worse time.

1198
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:51,741
Oh, stop this insanity, John,
and come back with me.

1199
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,079
I can't. Not now.

1200
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:56,212
I'm convinced we're on the verge
of a breakthrough.

1201
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,419
Here you are, driver. That'll be all.

1202
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:02,881
<i>But I had to come. I had to.</i>

1203
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:05,466
<i>I've waited such a long time.</i>

1204
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:07,802
<i>I've earned my happiness.</i>

1205
01:22:09,967 --> 01:22:12,720
I was afraid this would be your attitude.

1206
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:16,311
Well, I'm not leaving here until you've got
sense enough to leave with me.

1207
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:18,851
I hope no one minds if I join the ghost hunt.

1208
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:23,072
All right, I'll put your things in my room.

1209
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:26,029
I'll be very disappointed
if I don't see a ghost, John.

1210
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:28,193
Hadn't you better put me
in the ghastly dungeon...

1211
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,362
...or the mysterious secret chamber?

1212
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:33,328
There are no dungeons,
no secret chambers in Hill House.

1213
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:35,834
In fact, nothing romantic at all.

1214
01:22:35,993 --> 01:22:38,542
It's a deadly serious place.

1215
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:41,833
- Not even a treasure buried in the cellar?
-There's the nursery.

1216
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:46,630
- Eleanor.
-Thank you, my dear. The nursery it is.

1217
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:59,358
Grace, you must listen to me.
Certain things have happened here.

1218
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:02,520
You may not believe in the supernatural,
but these are physical facts.

1219
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:04,063
Mrs. Markway.

1220
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:08,700
Mrs. Markway, please,
don't sleep in the nursery.

1221
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:10,702
I didn't realize what I was saying.

1222
01:23:11,612 --> 01:23:13,535
You insult my intelligence.

1223
01:23:13,697 --> 01:23:17,497
You don't think I'd believe anything
you ghost hunters might tell me.

1224
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:20,754
Well, even so,
you shouldn't sleep in that room.

1225
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:23,166
It hasn't been opened
since we've been here.

1226
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:27,712
I agree with you about the spook bit,
Mrs. M., but it's true, the air might be bad.

1227
01:23:27,878 --> 01:23:30,097
Oh, poisonous.

1228
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:32,299
I've just remembered.
No problem.

1229
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:36,221
I don't have a key to the nursery,
and the Dudleys have gone for the night.

1230
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:38,935
Incidentally,
how'd you get through the gate?

1231
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:42,146
Very supernatural. With a key.

1232
01:23:42,309 --> 01:23:44,687
Your Mrs. Dudley is quite human,
I assure you...

1233
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:48,198
...and not at all averse to a $5 bill.

1234
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:51,490
Hey, look.

1235
01:24:01,912 --> 01:24:06,167
From your expressions,
I gather that <i>is</i> the dreaded nursery.

1236
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,469
And as for the bad air,
it's quite the opposite.

1237
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:12,006
There seems to be a draft.

1238
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:14,596
Hey, wait a minute, doc.

1239
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:18,436
I mean, this is ridiculous.
Nobody opened these doors.

1240
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:21,974
That's right, Luke.
You're beginning to see the light.

1241
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:24,768
I haven't seen a damn thing.

1242
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:28,067
I just don't like the way it looks.

1243
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:35,238
Now I know who your fiend of Hill House is.
The interior decorator.

1244
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:38,203
Evidently, Mrs. Dudley
doesn't get in here very often.

1245
01:24:38,365 --> 01:24:40,333
Looks the same
as the rest of the house to me.

1246
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:44,167
No, it's no use, Grace.
The air in here is stale.

1247
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:46,548
Well, I can take care of that.

1248
01:24:46,707 --> 01:24:49,756
Only one way to argue with a woman, doc.
Don't.

1249
01:24:50,544 --> 01:24:53,218
- Good night.
-Good night.

1250
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:55,303
My mother...

1251
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:03,686
Grace, this room is the cold,
rotten heart of the house.

1252
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:05,601
Since you're so foolish, I'll stay with you.

1253
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,861
But you're not to be in this room
alone tonight.

1254
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:11,570
John, I can't go on watching you
waste your life on all this nonsense.

1255
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:15,862
If there is such a thing as a haunted house,
this is my chance to find out.

1256
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:17,200
All right, all right.

1257
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:21,325
Oh, John, my bag.

1258
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:24,415
Oh. At least leave the door open, huh?

1259
01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:28,299
Don't worry.
I've brought a special ghost trap with me.

1260
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:38,263
<i>What if he does have a wife?
I still have a place in this house.</i>

1261
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:42,146
<i>I belong. I want to stay here.</i>

1262
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:45,524
<i>It's the only time
anything's ever happened to me.</i>

1263
01:25:45,682 --> 01:25:49,027
<i>He can't make me leave,
not if Hill House means me to stay.</i>

1264
01:25:49,186 --> 01:25:50,278
Stop it, Eleanor.

1265
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:52,064
<i>Go away, Eleanor. Go away.</i>

1266
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:56,326
<i>We don't want you anymore. You can't stay.</i>

1267
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:58,988
<i>But I can. I can.</i>

1268
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:01,248
<i>He doesn't make the rules around here.</i>

1269
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:03,033
--get a blanket.

1270
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:06,079
Nell, I'm talking to you.

1271
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:08,713
- I'm sorry.
-What's the matter? Didn't you hear Markway?

1272
01:26:10,248 --> 01:26:11,670
He doesn't want us to stay here.

1273
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:14,256
He wants us to spend the night
downstairs in the parlor.

1274
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:17,923
Luke and he will take turns
watching on this floor.

1275
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:21,643
Oh, Nell, for Pete's sake, snap out of it.

1276
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:03,529
- Why aren't you upstairs?
-I needed a drink.

1277
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:30,222
- Grace.
-Wait a minute.

1278
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,649
It's nowhere near the nursery.
It's down here.

1279
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:53,166
It seems to me
we've been on this kick before.

1280
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:55,797
Next vacation
I must really go somewhere else.

1281
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:15,688
<i>It knows my name.
This time it knows my name.</i>

1282
01:29:16,518 --> 01:29:18,270
- I'll have to go out there.
-No!

1283
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:21,823
No! It hasn't hurt me.
Why should it hurt her?

1284
01:29:21,982 --> 01:29:24,155
She might try to do something about it.

1285
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:30,832
Is it over, Theo? Is it?

1286
01:29:31,658 --> 01:29:34,502
No, I'm so cold.

1287
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:36,584
It's going to start everything all over again.

1288
01:29:44,838 --> 01:29:48,138
it can't get in. it can't get in. Don't let it get in.

1289
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:13,867
Oh, God, it knows I'm here.

1290
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:41,482
DOC?

1291
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:43,446
I'll let you have the house cheap.

1292
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:26,611
<i>It will go on and on
and come back again until it finds me.</i>

1293
01:31:26,773 --> 01:31:31,119
<i>On and on and on until it finds me.</i>

1294
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:43,464
It's at the nursery.

1295
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:46,050
- You must be crazy.
- I'm going!

1296
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:47,381
Not with that out there.

1297
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:50,172
- We have to. She's there.
- Don't be crazy.

1298
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:52,841
- No, you can't.
- I gotta find out if Grace is all right.

1299
01:31:53,008 --> 01:31:55,227
I don't know what that is.
I don't wanna find out--

1300
01:31:55,385 --> 01:31:58,559
I've gotta get out of here.
I've got to find out if Grace is all right.

1301
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:00,190
- No, don't.
- Cut it out.

1302
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:01,895
I'll come.

1303
01:32:02,058 --> 01:32:03,935
<i>I'll come.</i>

1304
01:32:04,102 --> 01:32:07,356
<i>Whatever it wants of me it can have.</i>

1305
01:33:14,172 --> 01:33:17,016
<i>The house is coming down around me.</i>

1306
01:33:17,175 --> 01:33:19,473
<i>The house is destroying itself.</i>

1307
01:33:38,113 --> 01:33:39,535
It's in the nursery.

1308
01:34:04,848 --> 01:34:06,976
Mrs. Markway?

1309
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:12,606
Please. Please.

1310
01:34:12,772 --> 01:34:14,900
Mrs. Markway?

1311
01:34:15,817 --> 01:34:17,569
Grace, are you--?

1312
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:20,079
Where is she?

1313
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:25,623
- Eleanor, where is she? What did you see?
-Nothing. Nothing.

1314
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:27,708
She wasn't here.

1315
01:34:28,454 --> 01:34:29,751
- What happened?
-She's gone.

1316
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:32,417
- Where? How?
-Good God.

1317
01:34:32,584 --> 01:34:34,382
Markway, if this is your idea of a joke...

1318
01:34:34,544 --> 01:34:37,593
...if this is what living in a haunted house
has done to your sense of humor--

1319
01:34:37,755 --> 01:34:39,473
Start with this room, then the whole house.

1320
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:42,226
- Even if we have to tear the place apart.
-You can't do that.

1321
01:34:42,385 --> 01:34:45,138
If we don't find her,
the police will be around quick enough...

1322
01:34:45,305 --> 01:34:47,524
<i>I'm coming apart a little at a time.</i>

1323
01:34:49,267 --> 01:34:51,395
<i>A little at a time.</i>

1324
01:34:52,478 --> 01:34:54,981
<i>Now I know where I'm going.</i>

1325
01:34:55,148 --> 01:35:00,279
<i>I'm disappearing inch by inch
into this house.</i>

1326
01:35:06,117 --> 01:35:09,997
We killed her. You and I, Hugh Crain.

1327
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:13,049
You and I.

1328
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,752
You and I.

1329
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:46,912
She must be around this house somewhere.

1330
01:35:47,075 --> 01:35:51,797
- Doc. Doc. Maybe this is a bad joke, huh?
-Grace isn't the kind of girl who makes jokes.

1331
01:35:51,955 --> 01:35:55,459
You find her. She's your wife.
I'm taking Nell and I'm clearing out of here.

1332
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:57,548
Eleanor. Where is Eleanor?

1333
01:36:11,474 --> 01:36:13,943
<i>I want to stay here.</i>

1334
01:36:14,686 --> 01:36:17,485
<i>I want to stay here always.</i>

1335
01:36:20,024 --> 01:36:23,824
<i>I will not be frightened or alone anymore.</i>

1336
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:28,125
Eleanor! Eleanor!

1337
01:36:29,284 --> 01:36:31,036
Eleanor?

1338
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:32,829
Has anyone checked outside?

1339
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:35,165
- Eleanor!
- Nell!

1340
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:37,004
Please, Nell, where are you?

1341
01:36:46,134 --> 01:36:49,434
<i>Here I am. Here I am, inside.</i>

1342
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:54,814
<i>It's not cold at all, and the smell is gone.</i>

1343
01:37:22,712 --> 01:37:25,886
<i>I've broken the spell of Hill House.</i>

1344
01:37:26,049 --> 01:37:29,019
<i>I'm home. I'm home.</i>

1345
01:37:29,177 --> 01:37:32,477
<i>I'm home. I'm home.</i>

1346
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:38,653
<i>No stone lions for me. I am home.</i>

1347
01:39:12,363 --> 01:39:13,956
Eleanor!

1348
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:16,416
<i>I will not look back...</i>

1349
01:39:16,576 --> 01:39:19,079
<i>...because then they will know
what I am thinking.</i>

1350
01:39:19,579 --> 01:39:22,879
Eleanor, turn around and come down.

1351
01:39:29,714 --> 01:39:31,432
Now, be very, very careful.

1352
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:35,599
Now, come down.

1353
01:39:40,892 --> 01:39:44,237
<i>All that is gone and left behind.</i>

1354
01:39:44,395 --> 01:39:47,148
Eleanor, for God's sake!

1355
01:39:55,781 --> 01:39:56,907
Wait a minute, doc.

1356
01:39:57,074 --> 01:40:00,294
- This thing's gonna collapse--
-It can't possibly hold the both of you.

1357
01:40:12,632 --> 01:40:14,259
Just turn around, Eleanor.

1358
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:17,728
Keep hold of the rail and start down slowly.

1359
01:40:49,752 --> 01:40:51,504
Stand still. Don't move.

1360
01:40:53,923 --> 01:40:55,925
Stand perfectly still!

1361
01:40:56,092 --> 01:40:59,096
Nell, do what they say, please!

1362
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:38,559
I'm coming on the platform.

1363
01:42:25,222 --> 01:42:27,020
Now, come along.

1364
01:42:50,414 --> 01:42:52,667
Now, are you sure, Eleanor?

1365
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:54,927
It was Mrs. Markway.

1366
01:42:55,086 --> 01:42:58,590
Just before I fainted, I looked up,
and there she was above the trapdoor.

1367
01:42:58,756 --> 01:43:00,224
What's more, she's still around.

1368
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:04,224
I don't know who
or what you really saw, Eleanor.

1369
01:43:04,387 --> 01:43:07,140
But whatever it was,
we can't risk letting it happen again.

1370
01:43:07,306 --> 01:43:10,025
- That's why you're leaving right now.
- But I can't leave now.

1371
01:43:10,184 --> 01:43:13,438
- I brought her car around. Is she ready?
- She's all packed. Take her suitcase.

1372
01:43:13,604 --> 01:43:16,528
Oh, no, please, Luke, let me stay.

1373
01:43:16,691 --> 01:43:18,318
I'll help Mrs. Dudley.

1374
01:43:18,484 --> 01:43:20,703
All it would cost you is just my keep.

1375
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:23,660
Sorry, honey, but you're not the type I keep.

1376
01:43:23,823 --> 01:43:27,373
- I can't leave, I tell you.
-Well, I can't take any more chances.

1377
01:43:27,535 --> 01:43:30,505
I realize now what a terrible thing
I was asking of you all.

1378
01:43:30,663 --> 01:43:32,506
Now, you're leaving as quickly as you can.

1379
01:43:32,665 --> 01:43:34,588
Then we'll find Grace
and we'll go to the police.

1380
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:35,842
It isn't fair.

1381
01:43:36,001 --> 01:43:38,675
I'm the one who's supposed to stay here.
She's taken my place.

1382
01:43:38,838 --> 01:43:41,057
Now, don't you worry.
Luke will see you get there safely.

1383
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:43,889
- Get where? Get where?
-Why, home, of course.

1384
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:46,770
Back to your own little apartment,
where all your things are.

1385
01:43:47,263 --> 01:43:49,231
I haven't any home.

1386
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:51,188
I made it up.

1387
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:54,149
No apartment, no things...

1388
01:43:54,311 --> 01:43:56,234
Everything in all the world
that belongs to me...

1389
01:43:56,397 --> 01:43:59,526
...is in that suitcase and a carton in my car.

1390
01:44:00,192 --> 01:44:03,696
So you see,
there's no place you can send me.

1391
01:44:03,863 --> 01:44:05,331
I have to stay here.

1392
01:44:05,489 --> 01:44:07,491
You must have lived somewhere
before you came here.

1393
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:11,128
- You had an address where I wrote you.
-My sister's.

1394
01:44:11,287 --> 01:44:13,756
I sleep on a couch in the living room.

1395
01:44:13,914 --> 01:44:16,588
I'd be much happier here.
I can't go back to my sister's.

1396
01:44:16,751 --> 01:44:19,595
Yes, you can, and immediately.

1397
01:44:20,296 --> 01:44:24,221
This is a mistake. Don't you understand?
The house wants me.

1398
01:44:24,383 --> 01:44:26,761
Mrs. Markway can't satisfy it.
No one else can.

1399
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:28,770
Forget all about this house
as soon as you can.

1400
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:33,309
No, please. I'm fine now. I'm not afraid.

1401
01:44:34,477 --> 01:44:36,730
I was happy here.

1402
01:44:36,896 --> 01:44:38,648
I don't think Mrs. Markway will be.

1403
01:44:38,814 --> 01:44:40,282
Put the bag in the car, Luke.

1404
01:44:40,441 --> 01:44:42,068
Nell is right. Grace is around somewhere.

1405
01:44:42,234 --> 01:44:44,862
- You see?
-Please, Eleanor, there's no time to waste.

1406
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:46,246
Please let me stay.

1407
01:44:46,405 --> 01:44:48,499
I'm the only one
who can call Mrs. Markway back.

1408
01:44:48,657 --> 01:44:51,661
I was wrong.
I should have sent you home the first night.

1409
01:44:54,705 --> 01:44:56,958
This is the only time
anything's ever happened to me.

1410
01:45:03,506 --> 01:45:04,883
I'm the one it really wants.

1411
01:45:07,384 --> 01:45:09,478
Can't you feel it?

1412
01:45:10,054 --> 01:45:11,556
It's alive.

1413
01:45:11,764 --> 01:45:13,858
Watching...

1414
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:15,772
...waiting.

1415
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:22,074
Waiting for me.

1416
01:45:26,737 --> 01:45:28,080
I won't go away.

1417
01:45:28,614 --> 01:45:30,742
You will go away. Right now.

1418
01:45:34,787 --> 01:45:36,585
- Oh, no, come on.
-I'll drive. It's my car.

1419
01:45:37,665 --> 01:45:38,757
At least, half mine.

1420
01:45:39,792 --> 01:45:42,796
All right, let her. I can't stand here arguing.

1421
01:45:42,962 --> 01:45:45,511
Thank you for rescuing me in the library.

1422
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:50,061
That was wrong of me, I know,
but I'm all right now, honestly.

1423
01:45:50,219 --> 01:45:52,187
I'm sorry.

1424
01:45:52,346 --> 01:45:54,144
I'm terribly sorry, really.

1425
01:45:57,768 --> 01:45:59,145
Goodbye.

1426
01:45:59,311 --> 01:46:01,279
Let's get moving, huh?

1427
01:46:04,942 --> 01:46:06,694
Theo!

1428
01:46:08,654 --> 01:46:10,827
I thought you weren't gonna say goodbye.

1429
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:13,709
Oh, Nellie, my Nell, be happy.
Please be happy.

1430
01:46:14,493 --> 01:46:16,211
Everything's going to be all right.

1431
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:19,465
I'm sure Grace is here and we'll find her,
so don't worry.

1432
01:46:19,623 --> 01:46:21,842
She has my place. It isn't fair.

1433
01:46:22,042 --> 01:46:24,420
Goodbye, Eleanor.

1434
01:46:27,756 --> 01:46:29,599
I'll write you.

1435
01:46:29,758 --> 01:46:31,977
Now, drive carefully, huh?

1436
01:46:32,136 --> 01:46:34,059
Goodbye.

1437
01:46:34,221 --> 01:46:36,189
Goodbye.

1438
01:46:39,894 --> 01:46:43,068
Who do I thank for a lovely time?

1439
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:49,324
Oh, hold it.
Markway!

1440
01:46:51,947 --> 01:46:53,790
- The key.
-Key?

1441
01:46:53,949 --> 01:46:55,576
To the gate.

1442
01:46:55,743 --> 01:46:57,336
Oh, yes, of course.

1443
01:46:57,536 --> 01:47:01,791
<i>What fools they are.
The house tricks them so easily.</i>

1444
01:47:01,957 --> 01:47:05,757
<i>Just by telling me to go away,
they can't make me leave.</i>

1445
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:07,968
<i>They can't shut me out.</i>

1446
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:10,633
<i>Not if Hill House means me to stay.</i>

1447
01:47:10,799 --> 01:47:12,676
- Nell!
-Eleanor!

1448
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:14,390
Wait!

1449
01:47:14,553 --> 01:47:16,396
Wait!

1450
01:47:16,555 --> 01:47:18,307
Eleanor!

1451
01:47:24,647 --> 01:47:26,445
So now I'm going.

1452
01:47:27,024 --> 01:47:31,871
<i>But I won't go. Hill House belongs to me.</i>

1453
01:47:33,864 --> 01:47:36,287
<i>I knew it. I knew it.</i>

1454
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:38,953
<i>Hill House doesn't want me to go.</i>

1455
01:47:45,084 --> 01:47:48,304
Stop it. Please. What are you doing?

1456
01:47:48,462 --> 01:47:49,884
Let go.

1457
01:47:51,715 --> 01:47:53,433
What are you doing?

1458
01:47:55,386 --> 01:47:59,141
<i>Why don't they stop me?
Can't they see what is happening?</i>

1459
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:02,860
<i>But it's happening to you, Eleanor.</i>

1460
01:48:03,018 --> 01:48:04,645
<i>Yes.</i>

1461
01:48:04,812 --> 01:48:07,361
<i>Something at last is really...</i>

1462
01:48:07,523 --> 01:48:11,994
<i>...really, really happening to me.</i>

1463
01:48:44,935 --> 01:48:46,778
She's dead.

1464
01:48:58,490 --> 01:49:00,083
Grace!

1465
01:49:00,242 --> 01:49:03,837
I didn't want any of this to happen.
You must believe me, John.

1466
01:49:03,996 --> 01:49:06,215
Well, what were you doing?
What happened?

1467
01:49:06,373 --> 01:49:08,626
That terrible house.

1468
01:49:08,792 --> 01:49:12,672
I woke up and I was frightened,
so I tried to find your room, but I got lost.

1469
01:49:12,838 --> 01:49:14,932
Almost as though
the house was doing it on purpose.

1470
01:49:16,216 --> 01:49:17,684
And I ended up in the attic.

1471
01:49:17,843 --> 01:49:20,687
I was only trying to find a way out
when I opened the trapdoor.

1472
01:49:20,846 --> 01:49:22,848
I wasn't trying to frighten her.

1473
01:49:23,015 --> 01:49:26,940
- Didn't you see me?
-No, but Eleanor did.

1474
01:49:27,102 --> 01:49:29,104
The shock of seeing you almost killed her.

1475
01:49:29,271 --> 01:49:31,069
She did kill her.

1476
01:49:31,607 --> 01:49:34,201
Seeing her is what made Eleanor
lose control of the car.

1477
01:49:34,359 --> 01:49:37,909
Oh, no, no.
She only saw me the very last instant.

1478
01:49:38,072 --> 01:49:40,746
The same time I saw her.

1479
01:49:40,908 --> 01:49:43,286
I don't even know how I got out here.

1480
01:49:43,827 --> 01:49:46,205
It wasn't your fault.

1481
01:49:46,371 --> 01:49:48,840
Eleanor did it to herself.

1482
01:49:48,999 --> 01:49:53,004
It looked to me, anyway,
like she deliberately aimed the car at this tree.

1483
01:49:54,630 --> 01:49:59,852
Where the first Mrs. Crain
was also killed in an accident.

1484
01:50:00,385 --> 01:50:02,353
Here's the mark.

1485
01:50:04,515 --> 01:50:07,485
There was something in the car with her,
I'm sure of it.

1486
01:50:07,643 --> 01:50:10,442
Call it what you like,
but Hill House is haunted.

1487
01:50:11,563 --> 01:50:14,362
It didn't want her to leave,
and her poor bedeviled mind...

1488
01:50:14,525 --> 01:50:17,119
...wasn't strong enough to fight it.

1489
01:50:18,278 --> 01:50:22,124
- Poor Eleanor.
-Maybe not poor Eleanor.

1490
01:50:22,533 --> 01:50:26,413
It was what she wanted, to stay here.

1491
01:50:26,578 --> 01:50:29,047
She had no place else to go.

1492
01:50:30,332 --> 01:50:33,211
The house belongs to her now too.

1493
01:50:33,377 --> 01:50:35,345
Maybe she's happier.

1494
01:50:35,504 --> 01:50:37,006
You wait here, Grace.

1495
01:50:37,172 --> 01:50:39,675
I'll go and get your things
and call the police.

1496
01:50:39,842 --> 01:50:42,641
No, no. No one must go in that house again.
Whatever is there might--

1497
01:50:42,803 --> 01:50:44,646
I'll be all right.

1498
01:50:45,139 --> 01:50:47,608
The house has what it wants...

1499
01:50:48,350 --> 01:50:50,148
...for a while.

1500
01:50:57,151 --> 01:51:02,248
It ought to be burned down
and the ground sowed with salt.

1501
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:12,421
<i>Hill House has stood for 90 years
and might stand for 90 more.</i>

1502
01:51:12,583 --> 01:51:17,384
<i>Within, walls continue upright, bricks meet...</i>

1503
01:51:17,546 --> 01:51:21,972
<i>...floors are firm,
and doors are sensibly shut.</i>

1504
01:51:22,134 --> 01:51:26,480
<i>Silence lies steadily against the wood
and stone of Hill House.</i>

1505
01:51:26,638 --> 01:51:31,360
<i>And we who walk here walk alone.</i>
