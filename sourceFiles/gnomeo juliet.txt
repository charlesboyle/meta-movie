1
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:53,294
Shh! Shh!

2
00:00:59,443 --> 00:01:04,403
The story you are about to see
has been told before. A lot.

3
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:08,680
And now we are going to tell it again.
But different.

4
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,849
It's about two star-crossed lovers
kept apart by a big feud.

5
00:01:12,923 --> 00:01:16,757
No one knows how this feud started,
but it's all quite entertaining.

6
00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:22,961
Unfortunately, before we begin,
there is a rather long, boring prologue,

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,763
which I will read to you now.

8
00:01:27,138 --> 00:01:30,733
"Two households, both alike in dignity,"

9
00:01:30,808 --> 00:01:32,571
In fair Verona...

10
00:01:34,145 --> 00:01:36,045
Where we lay our scene,

11
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,776
From ancient grudge
break to new mutiny,

12
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:42,580
Where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

13
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:48,583
"From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes..."

14
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:11,674
Ah, Miss Montague,
out you come to ruin my day.

15
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:15,674
My, that's a hideous cardigan,
Mr. Capulet. It suits you.

16
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,084
Wizened old hag.

17
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:19,419
You crumbly old codger.

18
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:39,971
Oh, great.

19
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,119
No, this way!

20
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,387
Whoa!

21
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:04,500
I got one! I got one!

22
00:03:08,505 --> 00:03:09,938
I got one! I got one!

23
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,544
Winston! Throw us the ball!

24
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,408
Huh?

25
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:20,111
Huh?

26
00:03:30,394 --> 00:03:31,793
Tybalt!

27
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:39,035
Oh, those Blues are at it again.

28
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:45,667
Top of the morning,
Lord Redbrick!

29
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:46,971
Lady Bluebury.

30
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:51,243
Your tulips are looking a little limp
this year, aren't they?

31
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:54,148
Oh! I don't like
what you're incinerating.

32
00:03:54,184 --> 00:03:57,585
The proper word is "insinuating."

33
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:59,179
Illiterate.

34
00:03:59,223 --> 00:04:02,556
I am not illiterate!
My parents were married!

35
00:04:12,102 --> 00:04:15,503
Benny! Come on. Let's go give those Reds
another lesson on how it's done.

36
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,234
Yeah.

37
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:19,003
Shroom, all clear?

38
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,708
Gnomeo! Gnomeo!

39
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:26,011
- Gnomeo! It's your mum!
- Huh? Oh, no!

40
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,143
Just get this out into the alley!
I'll catch up with you.

41
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,584
- OK, OK.
- Gnomeo...

42
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:35,614
Mum! Have you ever seen our beautiful,
beautiful garden from this angle?

43
00:04:35,826 --> 00:04:39,694
Oh, yes. Especially the wisteria.

44
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:44,065
That tree was your father's
pride and joy.

45
00:04:44,134 --> 00:04:46,602
May he rest in pieces.

46
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,401
Oh, how you remind me of him.

47
00:04:50,474 --> 00:04:52,237
Oh. Which is why I wanted to say...

48
00:04:52,276 --> 00:04:54,369
- I know. I know. My chores.
- Gnomeo...

49
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:57,073
Edging, trimming, planting, pruning.
Consider it all done.

50
00:04:57,147 --> 00:04:59,240
- I wanted to say...
- Done, done. It's done like I did it.

51
00:04:59,283 --> 00:05:00,978
- Gnomeo!
- Done.

52
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:05,579
All I wanted to say was "good luck."

53
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,255
Thanks, Mum.

54
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,990
Go out there and show them we Blues

55
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,895
are better than any Red!

56
00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:17,093
Red. I hate the word.

57
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,232
Wow!

58
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:25,537
A Cupid's Arrow orchid!

59
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,234
Oh! Juliet!

60
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:29,939
Huh? Oh! Whoa!

61
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:32,677
Oh.

62
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:39,581
Hiya, Dad!
You won't believe what I found!

63
00:05:39,623 --> 00:05:40,988
Do you want to get smashed?

64
00:05:41,058 --> 00:05:44,960
Aflower that will put that Blue garden
to shame, just across the alley.

65
00:05:44,995 --> 00:05:47,828
This feud business
is none of your concern.

66
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:50,230
And as leader of this garden,
it's up to me to...

67
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,031
Uh, I am a Red, after all.

68
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:57,267
Oh, you're just as impulsivated
as your mother was. Bless her to bits.

69
00:05:57,307 --> 00:05:59,537
Now, back where you belong.

70
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,340
I can't just stay tucked away
on this pedestal all my life.

71
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:05,905
Don't you see?
When will you realize you're delicate?

72
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,782
I'm not delicate!

73
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:11,447
She's definitely not delicate.

74
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:15,256
Stubborn girl.

75
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:17,617
Right.

76
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:23,190
Delicate? Hmm!
I'll show him who's delicate.

77
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:27,862
Gnomeo! Gnomeo!

78
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:31,169
Tybalt, go!
Tybalt, go! Tybalt, go!

79
00:06:31,241 --> 00:06:33,971
Gnomeo! Gnomeo! Gnomeo!

80
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:37,037
Tybalt, go! Tybalt, go! Tybalt, go!

81
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:38,604
Gnomeo!

82
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:42,813
OK, boys, y'all know the rules,
and I don't need to repeat them.

83
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:46,311
But I'm gonna, because I wanna.
And here they are:

84
00:06:46,356 --> 00:06:49,655
No biting, no scratching,
no kicking, no burping,

85
00:06:49,693 --> 00:06:51,752
no slurping, no cussing, no squalling,

86
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:54,730
no rassling, no heeing, no hawing,

87
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:58,529
and more than anything, no cheating!

88
00:06:58,602 --> 00:07:01,036
No cheating? Hey, that's not fair!

89
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:05,030
- Gnomeo! Gnomeo! Gnomeo!
- On your marks! Get set!

90
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:07,543
- Sucker!
- Go, go, go!

91
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,592
Huh?

92
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:52,686
Aah!

93
00:07:53,423 --> 00:07:54,890
Whoa!

94
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:08,170
No!

95
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,968
Gnomeo! Gnomeo! Gnomeo!

96
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,271
Tybalt, go! Tybalt, go!

97
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,933
You're the greatest, boss.
The greatest by far.

98
00:08:43,974 --> 00:08:46,442
The greatest! The greatest by far!

99
00:08:46,476 --> 00:08:51,004
Oh! Please, please, my friends.
Tell me something I don't already know.

100
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:53,606
A cheat! A cheat! That's what you are!

101
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,982
A cheat! A cheat! That's what you are!

102
00:08:57,154 --> 00:08:59,554
Well, Benny, I didn't think
it was possible,

103
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,616
but your mouth is getting
even bigger than your hat!

104
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:06,829
Tybalt! You just crossed the line!

105
00:09:06,863 --> 00:09:08,888
Yeah! The finish line!

106
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:14,365
Adios, loser!

107
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:17,669
Hey! Come on out and fight
like a gnome!

108
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:21,807
- Flower boy won't come out!
- What's he gonna do?

109
00:09:21,845 --> 00:09:24,837
- You better do something!
- He can't get away with that!

110
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:28,476
Show him! Show him! Come on!

111
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:33,113
Well, if he won't come out,
I guess we'll just have to go in.

112
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,058
The Red garden?
No one's ever been in there!

113
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:39,493
Then I'd say
it's about time someone did.

114
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,395
And payback is going to be fun.

115
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,216
Shroom, let's go kick some grass.

116
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:10,221
This mission into Red garden territory

117
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,591
is going to require maximum stealth.

118
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:16,258
Well, you won't get much
stealthier than this.

119
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:18,962
Hello!

120
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,953
I got one.

121
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:41,050
I got one.

122
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:46,456
Swim away. Be free.

123
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,895
Oh! Thank you.

124
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,270
I got one.

125
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:20,962
All this for some daffy flower.

126
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:24,763
Yes. It's the only way I'll ever
be taken seriously around here.

127
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:26,826
And I'm gonna need you to cover,
Nanette.

128
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:29,701
If my dad asks, just tell him
I'm washing my hair.

129
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,297
"I'm washing my hair."

130
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:33,832
I don't have hair!
He'll know it's a lie!

131
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,710
- No, my hair!
- Got it! I'm washing your hair!

132
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,579
OK, OK, whatever you say. I'll be quick.

133
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:47,614
Out! Out!

134
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:49,284
Damn, Spot!
Over here, boy!

135
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,118
Wow! That was quick!

136
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:55,654
I'm too easy to see.
I'm gonna need some kind of disguise.

137
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:59,100
Ooh! A new outfit! I'm on it.

138
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:06,667
Here. That is cute.

139
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,175
Give us a turn.

140
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:13,742
Nice junk in the trunk.
Now, go get your flower.

141
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:17,344
Uh... Maybe a tad less fluorescent pink?

142
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:18,877
How much less?

143
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:20,081
Try black.

144
00:12:25,362 --> 00:12:28,160
Huh?

145
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:38,004
Trust me. Nobody is going
to pay you any attention in that.

146
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,406
Then it's perfect.

147
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:46,675
Ooh!

148
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,250
I'm going in.

149
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:06,025
Take care! I'll tell your dad
you're doing your hair!

150
00:13:08,672 --> 00:13:12,039
Let's play a game.
I'm thinking of a movie.

151
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:16,569
It's one word,
and it starts with, um, "Spider."

152
00:13:16,646 --> 00:13:18,079
Is it <i>Spider-Man?</i>

153
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:20,048
Oh, you're good. OK.

154
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:40,926
This is great! I love going commando!

155
00:13:41,004 --> 00:13:43,768
Shh! Now, just keep quiet.

156
00:13:58,054 --> 00:13:59,487
Shh!

157
00:14:12,836 --> 00:14:17,933
OK, I have another one. Two words.
The first word is "Spider-Man."

158
00:14:17,974 --> 00:14:19,441
<i>Spider-Man 2?</i>

159
00:14:19,476 --> 00:14:21,808
OK, who's cheating?

160
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:34,281
Benny, give me the paint. Benny?

161
00:14:34,324 --> 00:14:36,656
No.

162
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:45,958
- Benny! Benny!
- Oh!

163
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,046
- Huh?
- Huh?

164
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:01,141
- Tybalt!
- Get them, you idiots!

165
00:15:01,184 --> 00:15:02,651
Come on, let's go!

166
00:15:02,686 --> 00:15:04,051
Run for it! Now!

167
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,984
- Where did he go?!
- He's in the begonias!

168
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:16,726
- Well, do I look like a begonia?
- No, more like a pansy.

169
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,994
Find him!

170
00:15:18,034 --> 00:15:20,468
- Not here.
- Not here either.

171
00:15:22,872 --> 00:15:25,204
Nothing but daisies here.

172
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:27,507
Come on!

173
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,708
Hold on.

174
00:15:35,785 --> 00:15:37,514
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

175
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:41,888
- Hey, Benny. See you on the other side!
- Gnomeo! No!

176
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:52,196
Huh?

177
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:10,312
Hmm?

178
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,080
Huh?

179
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:22,327
I wish I could stay, but gotta fly.

180
00:16:34,844 --> 00:16:36,141
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

181
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,784
Huh.

182
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,366
# <i>Feet are feelin' light</i>

183
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,274
# <i>Head on out to see the sights</i>

184
00:17:15,552 --> 00:17:20,717
# <i>Ain't life a many splendored thing?</i>

185
00:17:24,094 --> 00:17:29,122
<i>Ducking up and down</i>
<i>All these crazy sights and sounds</i>

186
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:33,829
# <i>Bounce around</i>
<i>like puppets on a string</i>

187
00:17:35,438 --> 00:17:41,343
# <i>Never gonna find</i>
<i>Anything to change my mind</i>

188
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:45,074
# <i>Famous last lines of a fool</i>

189
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:52,214
# <i>Just when you think</i>
<i>You're a chain with just one link</i>

190
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:57,157
# <i>Something comes</i>
<i>to tip you off of your stool</i>

191
00:17:57,694 --> 00:18:00,891
- # <i>Hello, hello</i>
- # <i>Hello, hello</i>

192
00:18:00,964 --> 00:18:03,956
# <i>My, my, my, what have we here?</i>

193
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:07,835
# <i>What a surprise</i>
<i>What a surprise</i>

194
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:10,840
- # <i>Hello, hello</i>
- # <i>Hello, hello</i>

195
00:18:10,874 --> 00:18:14,002
# <i>I'm not alone</i>
<i>It's good to know</i>

196
00:18:14,043 --> 00:18:18,844
# <i>Someone's out there to say hello</i>

197
00:18:18,882 --> 00:18:22,045
# <i>Hello</i>

198
00:18:22,085 --> 00:18:23,712
Um...

199
00:18:23,753 --> 00:18:26,017
You're probably wondering what I'm doing
on the roof of your greenhouse.

200
00:18:26,055 --> 00:18:29,252
It's just I...
Well, I thought no one lived here.

201
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:32,658
They... don't. I mean, I don't.
This isn't my garden.

202
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:35,858
Oh, well, that's good because
I just came to get that orchid.

203
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:38,732
- Oh. This?
- Yes.

204
00:18:39,903 --> 00:18:42,463
I don't know, I think I'm going
to have to keep ahold of this one.

205
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:46,407
What? But I saw it first,
so why don't you just hand it over.

206
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:49,900
Well, I grabbed it first.
Possession is nine-tenths of the law.

207
00:18:49,979 --> 00:18:52,379
But if you want it, come and get it.

208
00:18:52,415 --> 00:18:54,747
All right. Thanks.

209
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:56,684
Nice greenhouse, eh?

210
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,517
- Oh, yeah, you should see it from here.
- And miss this view?

211
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,385
- Who's your gnomey?
- "Who's your gnomey?"

212
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,920
Whoa!

213
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:12,367
Who's your gnomey now?

214
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:16,731
- # <i>Hello, hello</i>
- # <i>Hello, hello</i>

215
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:20,173
- Hey!
- # <i>My, my, my, what have we here?</i>

216
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:21,574
Whoa!

217
00:19:21,611 --> 00:19:24,705
# <i>What a surprise</i>
<i>What a surprise</i>

218
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,511
- # <i>Hello, hello</i>
- # <i>Hello, hello</i>

219
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:30,712
# <i>I'm not alone</i>
<i>It's good to know</i>

220
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:36,055
- # <i>Someone's out there to say hello</i>
- # <i>Hello</i>

221
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,993
- # <i>Hello</i>
- # <i>Hello</i>

222
00:19:39,062 --> 00:19:41,530
# <i>Hello</i>

223
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,862
# <i>Hello</i>

224
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:47,127
# <i>Hello, hello</i>

225
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,866
# <i>Hello</i>

226
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,636
# <i>Hello, hello</i> #.

227
00:20:10,326 --> 00:20:13,318
Oh, no. He's a Blue. Not a Blue.

228
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,874
Juliet. You're not allowed
off your pedestal.

229
00:20:34,951 --> 00:20:36,919
What are you doing
out in the alley?

230
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:40,683
I'm, um... Well, I could ask you
the same question, Tybalt.

231
00:20:40,757 --> 00:20:44,318
We're looking for a blue gnome.
Yeah, he's an ugly little fellow.

232
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,023
- Got a scratch, right here.
- And his name's Gnomeo.

233
00:20:48,097 --> 00:20:50,190
You haven't seen him, have you?

234
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:52,030
Uh... Ooh. Um...

235
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:55,196
Uh... He sounds awful.

236
00:20:55,238 --> 00:20:58,867
No, I... I, um, certainly haven't seen
him. I haven't seen him at all.

237
00:20:58,908 --> 00:21:02,344
Well, lucky you.
Come on. Let's get inside.

238
00:21:08,151 --> 00:21:10,346
Juliet.

239
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:23,365
A Red.

240
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:27,862
Why, of all things,
did she have to be a Red?

241
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:37,174
So, where is the oh-so-important,
life-changing orchid?

242
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,842
Um... Um...

243
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,874
What... What orchid?

244
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:52,294
What?

245
00:21:52,362 --> 00:21:53,989
Hmm?

246
00:21:55,264 --> 00:21:58,631
Shut up! You met a boy!

247
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:02,762
What? No. Well, maybe, sort of. Um...

248
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:05,672
Yes. Yes, I did.

249
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:09,075
I need details! And go slowly!

250
00:22:09,112 --> 00:22:11,137
- Is he totally gorgeous?
- Totally.

251
00:22:11,214 --> 00:22:13,409
Does he have a nice rotund belly?

252
00:22:13,449 --> 00:22:14,916
Well, let's call it sturdy.

253
00:22:14,951 --> 00:22:16,748
And his, uh...

254
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:19,453
His hat is, um...

255
00:22:19,522 --> 00:22:21,615
- Big and pointy?
- And...

256
00:22:21,657 --> 00:22:23,955
You know,
I suppose in a certain light,

257
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:27,759
you might say it looks sort of... blue.

258
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,466
Blue.

259
00:22:34,303 --> 00:22:37,295
Ah! This is one of your little jokes!

260
00:22:39,742 --> 00:22:41,767
No, I don't get it.

261
00:22:41,811 --> 00:22:44,143
Oh! Flipping, flaming Nora!

262
00:22:44,213 --> 00:22:46,340
She's smooching the face off a Blue!

263
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,350
Shh! Please shush, Nanette. Just zip it.

264
00:22:48,418 --> 00:22:50,181
Zip.

265
00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:55,719
Oh! Juliet! This is fantastic!

266
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:58,386
- Is it?
- It's doomed.

267
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:01,055
- What?
- A Red and a Blue.

268
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,394
It just can't be.

269
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:07,960
So it's a doomed love,
and that's the best kind.

270
00:23:08,004 --> 00:23:09,733
You'll never see him again.

271
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,535
And then one day when you die,
you'll be all...

272
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:16,943
"Oh, my true love. I only saw him once."

273
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:26,817
I'll only see... What do you mean...

274
00:23:26,856 --> 00:23:30,314
What are you chatting about "once,"
I'll only see him once?

275
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:33,157
How romantically tragic.

276
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:37,660
Your love is doomed. Your love is dead.

277
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,191
Your love is doomed. Your love is dead.

278
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:41,566
It's doomed. Dead.

279
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:45,300
- I'll only see him once?
- Doomed!

280
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:58,311
I've never seen
Lord Redbrick so riled up.

281
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:01,721
We have to find Gnomeo. Let's split up.

282
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:07,125
I wish I could quit you.

283
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,527
Hmm!

284
00:24:08,564 --> 00:24:10,464
Oh, well, let's go fishing.

285
00:24:15,505 --> 00:24:17,905
All right, boy.

286
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:23,676
Go find Gnomeo.

287
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:35,415
Doomed. Dead.
Doomed. Dead. Doomed. Dead.

288
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,491
O Gnomeo, Gnomeo,

289
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:50,505
are we really doomed, Gnomeo,
to never see each other again?

290
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,700
Why must you wear a blue hat?

291
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:57,372
Why couldn't it be red like my father,
or... or green like a leprechaun?

292
00:24:57,413 --> 00:25:02,783
Or purple like, um... like, uh...
like some weird guy?

293
00:25:02,818 --> 00:25:05,446
I mean, what's in a gnome? Because
you're blue, my father sees red,

294
00:25:05,488 --> 00:25:07,956
and because I'm red, I'm feeling blue.

295
00:25:08,024 --> 00:25:11,255
Oh. At any rate, that shouldn't be
the thing to keep us apart, should it?

296
00:25:11,294 --> 00:25:14,593
No! No, it shouldn't!
I couldn't have said it better myself!

297
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,396
Oh, my giddy aunt. Did you just hear
all of that? What are you doing here?

298
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:22,268
I don't know. Um... I came here to...

299
00:25:22,305 --> 00:25:24,500
Well, I don't know,
I just wanted to see you again.

300
00:25:24,574 --> 00:25:26,201
Are you crazy?

301
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:29,142
If Dad finds you,
he'll bury you under the patio!

302
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:31,976
Find me. You kidding?
"Stealth" is my middle name.

303
00:25:37,653 --> 00:25:41,646
No! Quick! Turn it off!

304
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:43,749
I'm trying!

305
00:25:46,729 --> 00:25:50,221
- Do something!
- The button's stuck! Come on.

306
00:25:52,835 --> 00:25:55,633
Aah! Juliet!

307
00:25:55,671 --> 00:25:57,571
It won't turn off!

308
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,165
- There's something behind you!
- Shroom!

309
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:01,699
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

310
00:26:01,777 --> 00:26:03,540
Juliet, what's with the...?

311
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,972
Ooh! You look like a fun-gi.

312
00:26:08,017 --> 00:26:10,918
- Excuse me, a little help here.
- My dad's coming.

313
00:26:12,121 --> 00:26:13,713
So, you must be Gnomeo.

314
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:17,384
Lovely to meet you... in the 30 seconds
before you're discovered and killed.

315
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,155
- Quick, hide.
- Juliet,

316
00:26:19,195 --> 00:26:23,256
I've told you before,
no music in the grotto after 10:00.

317
00:26:25,034 --> 00:26:27,798
- What's going on here?
- Um...

318
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,395
It was a... um...

319
00:26:29,472 --> 00:26:34,171
I saw a squirrel,
and he... he dropped his nuts.

320
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,270
Yes, nuts, the size of... boulders!

321
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,541
Yes, all right. Thank you, Nanette.

322
00:26:39,582 --> 00:26:43,040
Well, OK, but no mucking about,
especially not tonight.

323
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,145
We've been attacked, by a Blue!

324
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:50,488
And if I ever get my hands on a Blue,
he'll be sleeping with the fishes!

325
00:26:52,395 --> 00:26:54,955
Now, I'm not a man
who is wounded up easily!

326
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:57,226
Lord Redbrick,
I've been having problems with my...

327
00:26:57,266 --> 00:26:59,700
Your what?

328
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:01,828
I guess this isn't
the best time to talk.

329
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:03,361
- It's not ideal.
- But I...

330
00:27:03,406 --> 00:27:06,933
Just go. Please go.
...just came here to say I...

331
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:08,840
- What? You what?
- I'm...

332
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:11,108
- Oh, sorry.
- Juliet, is there something wrong

333
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,546
- with the pond?
- The pond? No. What, this pond?

334
00:27:13,582 --> 00:27:16,107
No, it's fine. I mean,
it's just as pondy as ever.

335
00:27:16,185 --> 00:27:18,380
Oh, my gosh!
What is that thing over there?

336
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:20,787
- What? What was it?
- The... thing, over there...

337
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:23,290
- What did it look like?
- Oh, it looked like a really...

338
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,385
OK, bye-bye then. Off you go.
Thanks for popping by.

339
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:28,624
Good night, sweet prince,
and flights of angels...

340
00:27:28,698 --> 00:27:31,394
Or pigeons or sparrows or whatever.

341
00:27:31,434 --> 00:27:34,528
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

342
00:27:42,645 --> 00:27:44,135
Ah.

343
00:27:44,213 --> 00:27:46,408
Nanette, where's Gnomeo? Is he gone?

344
00:27:46,449 --> 00:27:48,815
- Yeah. Gone forever.
- What?!

345
00:27:51,987 --> 00:27:53,887
Whoa!

346
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:57,825
I think you'll find this does,
actually, belong to you.

347
00:27:59,995 --> 00:28:02,463
Thank you.

348
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,574
- I can't go.
- I know how you feel.

349
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,944
No, really, I'm stuck.

350
00:28:23,552 --> 00:28:27,454
So, uh... can I see you again tomorrow?

351
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,516
- Yes, but not here.
- Back in the old Lawrence place, then?

352
00:28:30,593 --> 00:28:32,117
- Noon?
- Not soon enough.

353
00:28:32,161 --> 00:28:34,527
- I can do 11:45.
- Done.

354
00:28:34,597 --> 00:28:38,863
That frog was right.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

355
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,969
Whoa.

356
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:48,169
Thanks, Nanette.

357
00:28:48,244 --> 00:28:51,008
You know he's going to ditch you
when he finds out how much you weigh.

358
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:55,015
Shroom, do you see this face?

359
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:59,146
It's a happy gnome face.
Now, come here. Come on!

360
00:29:23,712 --> 00:29:26,442
Outrage! Infamy!

361
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:29,109
The gardening gloves are off then,
are they?

362
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:31,176
You!
Wrecking my mower!

363
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,451
Dear lady, you are insane
in the brain!

364
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,515
I never thought
even you'd stoop to such levels!

365
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:41,758
Oh, and by the way,
kindly stop stealing my underwear.

366
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:45,767
In your dreams,
you daft old cabbage!

367
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:49,703
Oh. How could she do this
to Tybalt's wishing well?

368
00:29:49,738 --> 00:29:54,539
Oh, my sweet little flower boy.
Why would anyone ever pick on you?

369
00:29:54,577 --> 00:29:56,272
Oh! Who thinks I should order

370
00:29:56,345 --> 00:30:01,339
the best new lawn mower money can buy?

371
00:30:02,251 --> 00:30:03,741
Oh...

372
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:12,227
Why would anyone do this to Tybalt?

373
00:30:12,328 --> 00:30:14,421
Because nobody likes him.

374
00:30:14,463 --> 00:30:17,489
So, what are we going to do?

375
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,796
Find their weak spots.

376
00:30:21,937 --> 00:30:23,427
Then what are we going to do?

377
00:30:24,206 --> 00:30:26,174
Damage.

378
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:30,269
Lots and lots of damage.

379
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:52,867
Right.
Mess with me, will you, Capulet?

380
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:56,200
I'll show you, you old sack of compost.

381
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:59,867
This is not over. Not by a long shot.

382
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:06,344
Ah. Right. What do we got here?

383
00:31:06,415 --> 00:31:08,315
She's on the Worldy Widey Web.

384
00:31:08,384 --> 00:31:11,820
- Uh, no. No, no, don't think so.
- That one! Pick that one!

385
00:31:11,854 --> 00:31:15,017
- Ooh! That one! Yes, I like that one.
- No, don't think so.

386
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:18,321
- No, no... That one!
- Oh! What's this?

387
00:31:18,394 --> 00:31:20,885
<i>Are you losing the war in your garden?</i>

388
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:24,330
<i>Well, brother, maybe it's time</i>
<i>for a secret weapon.</i>

389
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,368
<i>Terrafirminator!</i>

390
00:31:26,435 --> 00:31:29,461
<i>It's the most ruthless, 500-horsepower,</i>

391
00:31:29,505 --> 00:31:33,805
<i>grass-dominating piece of hardware</i>
<i>the world has ever seen!</i>

392
00:31:33,842 --> 00:31:36,333
<i>Terrafirminator!</i>

393
00:31:36,412 --> 00:31:41,816
<i>It's unnecessarily powerful!</i>
<i>Now with 75 percent more power!</i>

394
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,340
- <i>It clears!</i>
- <i>Clears!</i>

395
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:44,977
- <i>It digs!</i>
- <i>Digs!</i>

396
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,885
- <i>It mows!</i>
- <i>Mows!</i>

397
00:31:46,956 --> 00:31:49,720
<i>Your lawn will be afraid to grow!</i>

398
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:52,056
<i>Terrafirminator!</i>

399
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:55,494
<i>It's a weapon of grass destruction!</i>

400
00:31:55,531 --> 00:31:56,998
<i>Terrafirminator will not</i>
<i>inhibit grass from growing.</i>

401
00:31:57,032 --> 00:31:58,659
<i>Not recommended for residential use,</i>
<i>brother.</i>

402
00:31:58,701 --> 00:32:01,568
That one!

403
00:32:01,637 --> 00:32:03,332
Oh, my.

404
00:32:03,372 --> 00:32:06,000
Pick... that one!
Please, please, pick that one!

405
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:08,066
- Oh, dear.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

406
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,506
That's a bit in your face.

407
00:32:11,547 --> 00:32:14,141
This is more my speed.

408
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:15,241
<i>Meow.</i>

409
00:32:15,317 --> 00:32:19,219
Oh! Not the Kitten Clipper! Oh, no.

410
00:32:28,998 --> 00:32:30,363
Definitely not.

411
00:32:51,487 --> 00:32:52,647
Huh?

412
00:32:59,762 --> 00:33:01,195
Ow!

413
00:34:02,891 --> 00:34:05,359
- Juliet? There you are.
- Hi, Dad.

414
00:34:05,427 --> 00:34:08,919
I've been ruminating
about our little discussion yesterday.

415
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:12,866
- But I was just...
- What you need is compan-man-ship.

416
00:34:12,935 --> 00:34:15,495
Someone to look after you.
Who'll keep you safe.

417
00:34:15,571 --> 00:34:17,368
- What?
- You know Paris, don't you?

418
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:18,701
Yes. Yes, of course. Why?

419
00:34:18,774 --> 00:34:21,675
- He's come to pay you a visitation.
- Dad!

420
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:25,646
All right, all right. No one would ever
say I don't know when I'm not wanted.

421
00:34:25,681 --> 00:34:27,512
- Toodles!
- Got something for you.

422
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,710
Here it is. Gypsophila. Lovely.

423
00:34:29,785 --> 00:34:31,548
What does it mean?
It means "lover of chalk."

424
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,487
Although, ironically, it grows better
in a clay soil. It's weird.

425
00:34:34,523 --> 00:34:36,616
You think you got it down,
and then, bam, you do some reading,

426
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,023
it turns out it likes clay soil,

427
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,654
even though you thought it was
a lover of chalk. Weird.

428
00:34:40,696 --> 00:34:43,028
Right. Well, it's been
terribly nice speaking with you.

429
00:34:43,065 --> 00:34:46,159
Where are you going? Stop! No!
Obviously, do whatever you want.

430
00:34:46,268 --> 00:34:49,362
But my point was, surely, it's a bit
rude to leave me on a first date.

431
00:34:49,404 --> 00:34:50,837
- "First date"?
- Yeah.

432
00:34:50,939 --> 00:34:52,907
- I thought, what does a boyfriend...
- "Boyfriend"?

433
00:34:52,975 --> 00:34:54,772
Get his girlfriend?
"Girlfriend"?

434
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,437
Ooh! This is good!

435
00:34:57,546 --> 00:34:59,411
A small token of my affection.

436
00:34:59,982 --> 00:35:01,745
Oh. Wow.

437
00:35:01,817 --> 00:35:04,718
Juliet, do you realize what this is?

438
00:35:04,753 --> 00:35:08,120
It is my own hybrid
of foxglove and buttercup...

439
00:35:08,223 --> 00:35:11,784
A love triangle!
...which I call "foxbutt."

440
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:16,388
And you! I never knew you were
such a devil!

441
00:35:16,431 --> 00:35:18,865
No, I mean, you know,
I've got my dark side, sure.

442
00:35:19,668 --> 00:35:21,260
Hey there, Juliet.

443
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:24,703
What a name. It's a great name.
Goes with your... eyes.

444
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,573
You're looking really cool.
You're looking good.

445
00:35:27,643 --> 00:35:29,941
Did it hurt when you fell down
from heaven?

446
00:35:30,012 --> 00:35:34,142
That's a killer, man.
Yeah, no. You're looking cool. Yeah.

447
00:35:34,249 --> 00:35:37,776
- How's it going with you, baby?
- Oh, I'm fine, baby. How are you?

448
00:35:37,853 --> 00:35:40,481
Uh... uh...
Never better.

449
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:42,581
Huh?

450
00:35:45,761 --> 00:35:47,160
Do you think anyone heard that?

451
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:48,594
There's nobody here.

452
00:35:48,664 --> 00:35:52,293
- Then why are you whispering?
- Why are you whispering?

453
00:35:53,468 --> 00:35:55,493
Oh! Look at that!

454
00:35:57,139 --> 00:35:59,164
Guess we're done
with the whispering thing then.

455
00:36:01,043 --> 00:36:04,911
It's a 1950s MacAllister Ranger.

456
00:36:04,947 --> 00:36:07,780
- Let's start her up!
- Yeah! OK.

457
00:36:07,816 --> 00:36:09,841
Check out the power on this beauty.

458
00:36:14,823 --> 00:36:17,417
She's empty. Bingo.

459
00:36:20,696 --> 00:36:22,857
- Hey, try this.
- Thanks.

460
00:36:51,827 --> 00:36:54,227
- Is that you?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's me.

461
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:56,093
It's me, too!

462
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:03,761
- What was that?
- I have no idea.

463
00:37:05,073 --> 00:37:08,167
OK, whatever you are, come out slowly!

464
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,179
I have a loaded st... uh, weapon!

465
00:37:11,213 --> 00:37:13,773
And... And I'm not afraid to use it!

466
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,980
- Do you think I scared him?
- Oh, definitely.

467
00:37:17,085 --> 00:37:19,110
I know I'm scared.

468
00:37:19,888 --> 00:37:22,550
Look at that baby, huh? Watch me now!

469
00:37:26,862 --> 00:37:31,925
By the way, thanks for finding my leg,
and setting me free. I love you!

470
00:37:32,034 --> 00:37:35,993
Do you know what it's like
to be trapped for 20 years?

471
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:40,165
All alone by yourself,
no one for to talk at?

472
00:37:45,814 --> 00:37:47,213
"How's the other leg?"

473
00:37:47,249 --> 00:37:50,082
"I don't know, Featherstone, remember?
I don't have it."

474
00:37:50,152 --> 00:37:53,212
You see, I'm not exactly
terrific company, am I?

475
00:37:53,255 --> 00:37:55,280
Sorry, but we didn't think
anybody lived here.

476
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,620
Yeah, we shouldn't be here.
We'll be going.

477
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,719
- What if he follows us?
- Then our parents find out.

478
00:38:00,796 --> 00:38:04,254
Oh, no. Nanette was right. We're doomed!

479
00:38:05,901 --> 00:38:11,032
You cannot ever pull the wools
over these beady eyes. Ho-ho!

480
00:38:11,073 --> 00:38:13,769
I think that you two are on a date.

481
00:38:13,842 --> 00:38:15,503
- Date? No! No.
- Date? No! No.

482
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:18,238
- Not dating. Fighting.
- Fighting to the death.

483
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,043
- Mortal enemies here.
- Yeah, don't you see it?

484
00:38:20,082 --> 00:38:22,516
- He's a Blue!
- And she's a Red!

485
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:24,849
And I'm pink! Who cares?!

486
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,945
Anyway, I got to ask.

487
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:30,583
Why are you bringing her
to a dumpy place like this?

488
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,525
I know! I know!

489
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:35,325
I be right back!

490
00:38:39,634 --> 00:38:42,102
Juliet, wait.

491
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:45,196
Oh, here it comes.
I'm too delicate, right?

492
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,641
No, no. I was going to say,
don't hold back. Let her rip.

493
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,803
- Oh! Really?
- Yeah.

494
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:54,943
Go!

495
00:38:57,452 --> 00:38:59,511
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

496
00:39:00,322 --> 00:39:02,586
Whoo!

497
00:39:07,963 --> 00:39:09,692
Wow!

498
00:39:12,734 --> 00:39:14,463
Ta-da!

499
00:39:14,536 --> 00:39:19,473
Look at that! It's a definite
improvement. Fantastic penmanship, too.

500
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:22,908
But, you know, we still gotta do
something about these weeds.

501
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:26,175
They're not weeds.
Those dandelions are wishes.

502
00:39:26,248 --> 00:39:29,274
I don't know. Aweed by
any other name is still a weed.

503
00:39:29,317 --> 00:39:31,615
Go on. Make a wish and then blow on it.

504
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:39,925
It's kind of hard with a beak, huh?

505
00:39:41,997 --> 00:39:45,592
Kind of tires you out, huh?
I go to sit down now.

506
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:52,834
I've got a confession to make.
I've never actually driven a mower.

507
00:39:52,908 --> 00:39:54,341
No, you're a natural.

508
00:39:54,376 --> 00:39:58,813
Well, my dad,
he's a little overprotective.

509
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:07,978
You know this is crazy, right?

510
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,021
Yeah.

511
00:40:10,058 --> 00:40:12,424
I just never imagined
that I could fall for a Red.

512
00:40:12,594 --> 00:40:15,529
And me a Blue. No way.

513
00:40:15,597 --> 00:40:19,055
My whole life, my mum raised me
to hate you guys, you Reds.

514
00:40:19,134 --> 00:40:21,364
So, this could never work.

515
00:40:22,938 --> 00:40:24,098
Could it?

516
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:28,040
Well, a Red and a Blue,
it just can't be.

517
00:40:28,076 --> 00:40:30,237
Can it?

518
00:40:30,312 --> 00:40:33,770
Look!
It's kind of like snowing, but it's not.

519
00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:38,585
Oh, baby, you know, I getting into this
now. See, the trick is to go like...

520
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:40,780
Then you get them all with one.
You don't have to...

521
00:40:42,157 --> 00:40:47,720
Ah! I wish that we could all come back
and do this tomorrow.

522
00:40:47,762 --> 00:40:50,890
And, uh... I promise,

523
00:40:50,966 --> 00:40:53,400
your secret is safe with me.

524
00:40:54,503 --> 00:40:56,334
Well, should we?

525
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,669
I can do 11:45.

526
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:00,265
Not soon enough.

527
00:41:20,795 --> 00:41:23,263
Hey, Shroom. What's up, button head?

528
00:41:23,331 --> 00:41:26,562
Careful there. You're going to chip
something. What's eating you?

529
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,570
How? How?

530
00:41:36,111 --> 00:41:37,976
- Mum!
- Gnomeo!

531
00:41:38,046 --> 00:41:42,039
How could this have happened?
Where were you?

532
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,414
I was...

533
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,410
I was nowhere.

534
00:41:48,223 --> 00:41:50,316
Don't worry, Mum.
I'll make it up to you.

535
00:41:50,392 --> 00:41:53,589
How?! Redbrick and his hoodlums
have destroyed

536
00:41:53,628 --> 00:41:57,120
the most beautiful thing
we Blues have.

537
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,834
Your father planted her.

538
00:42:00,902 --> 00:42:03,928
We raised her from a seedling.

539
00:42:11,246 --> 00:42:15,307
Those blasted Reds! Come on, Gnomeo!
We'll make them pay!

540
00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:20,217
Every last one of them!

541
00:42:27,762 --> 00:42:30,094
Every last one?

542
00:42:44,946 --> 00:42:46,811
My dad can really pick them.

543
00:42:46,848 --> 00:42:48,440
Can't he just?

544
00:42:48,516 --> 00:42:51,974
- Oh! This is painful.
- Oh! Sweet torture.

545
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:16,542
- Ooh, shiny, shiny.
- Nanette?

546
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:28,583
Gnomeo.

547
00:43:39,134 --> 00:43:40,499
OK.

548
00:43:59,954 --> 00:44:01,979
Huh?

549
00:44:13,101 --> 00:44:15,934
Juliet, no, wait!
I... I...

550
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:23,640
A Blue! A Blue!

551
00:44:23,712 --> 00:44:25,942
- Abort, abort the mission!
- What, what happened?

552
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,811
Uh... The nozzle jammed. Let's go.

553
00:44:35,924 --> 00:44:38,119
Gnomeo?

554
00:44:44,332 --> 00:44:45,663
Hmm...

555
00:44:50,538 --> 00:44:54,941
Such a big hat
for such a small gnome.

556
00:44:54,976 --> 00:44:58,139
So, you boys fancy a little bit of fun?

557
00:44:58,213 --> 00:45:00,681
Let's take this baby out into the alley.

558
00:45:00,749 --> 00:45:02,114
Then what are we going to do?

559
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:06,109
We're going to have a smashing time.

560
00:45:08,556 --> 00:45:11,184
Aw, come on, Juliet.
It's not as bad as all that.

561
00:45:11,259 --> 00:45:12,920
Is that your big move on a second date?

562
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:15,828
You wine them, dine them,
and then spray them with weedkiller?

563
00:45:15,897 --> 00:45:17,694
You've got to admit, it is original.

564
00:45:17,766 --> 00:45:20,132
Hola!
My fellow funsters are back already.

565
00:45:20,235 --> 00:45:24,365
Juliet, be reasonable! I didn't have
a choice after "Incident Wisteria."

566
00:45:24,439 --> 00:45:26,839
How do you think that looks?
Just a toilet, in the middle of a yard,

567
00:45:26,908 --> 00:45:29,342
with nothing growing out of it.

568
00:45:29,377 --> 00:45:32,175
- You Blues are so infuriating!
- Wait a minute. Us Blues?

569
00:45:32,247 --> 00:45:34,943
- So, what you guys want to do?
- Featherstone, we're busy!

570
00:45:35,049 --> 00:45:37,313
Come on, guys! Let us have some fun!

571
00:45:37,352 --> 00:45:40,321
Let me tell you something
about you Reds.

572
00:45:40,355 --> 00:45:41,515
Us Reds?

573
00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:45,821
Can't we all just laugh about this?
I know your little mushroom dude can.

574
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,191
- Featherstone!
- Featherstone!

575
00:45:47,262 --> 00:45:48,889
- We're in the middle of something!
- You wouldn't understand.

576
00:45:48,963 --> 00:45:50,828
- Do you mind?
- Just leave us alone!

577
00:45:53,067 --> 00:45:56,093
Right. I'm sorry.

578
00:45:57,539 --> 00:46:01,703
You know, sometime
I get a little overexcited.

579
00:46:01,743 --> 00:46:06,976
Especially having such
great new friends. Like you, and...

580
00:46:07,081 --> 00:46:10,642
But I know I can be a bit... much.

581
00:46:14,422 --> 00:46:16,253
Wait, Featherstone. Hey...

582
00:46:16,324 --> 00:46:18,690
Come back,
Featherstone. I'm sorry.

583
00:46:59,467 --> 00:47:04,734
I may not be
a smart bird, but I know what love is.

584
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:10,370
# <i>You hear it everyday</i>

585
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:13,710
# <i>Once upon a time, they say</i>

586
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:17,942
# <i>Once upon a time in this place</i>

587
00:47:18,019 --> 00:47:21,455
# <i>I looked and saw on your face</i>

588
00:47:21,489 --> 00:47:24,322
# <i>A smile that spoke to me</i>

589
00:47:24,392 --> 00:47:27,850
# <i>In oh so many ways</i>

590
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:31,194
# <i>And love built a garden</i>

591
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:34,963
# <i>Grew it from the ground up</i>

592
00:47:35,036 --> 00:47:38,005
# <i>Each one of us knowing</i>

593
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:41,667
# <i>Every inch of it was us</i>

594
00:47:41,743 --> 00:47:44,837
# <i>We pulled it all together</i>

595
00:47:44,913 --> 00:47:48,212
# <i>Hoping and believing</i>

596
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:51,309
# <i>That love built this garden</i>

597
00:47:51,386 --> 00:47:56,688
# <i>For the two of us to dream in</i>

598
00:48:03,197 --> 00:48:06,166
# <i>We'd get a little rain</i>

599
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,431
# <i>Then the sun came out again</i>

600
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:13,205
# <i>But a frost, it's hard to fight</i>

601
00:48:13,274 --> 00:48:16,243
# <i>Once it takes hold, flowers die</i>

602
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:19,576
# <i>There's only so much you can do</i>

603
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:23,048
# <i>To keep some things alive</i>

604
00:48:23,117 --> 00:48:26,177
# <i>And love built a garden</i>

605
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:29,986
# <i>Grew it from the ground up</i>

606
00:48:30,024 --> 00:48:33,118
# <i>Each one of us knowing</i>

607
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:35,994
# <i>Every inch of it was us</i>

608
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:40,323
# <i>We pulled it all together</i>

609
00:48:40,368 --> 00:48:43,701
# <i>Hoping and believing</i>

610
00:48:43,771 --> 00:48:46,672
# <i>That love built this garden</i>

611
00:48:46,774 --> 00:48:50,471
# <i>For the two of us to dream in</i> #.

612
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:09,096
You know, other people's hate

613
00:49:09,163 --> 00:49:13,259
destroyed my love, and...

614
00:49:13,334 --> 00:49:16,064
I couldn't do nothing about it.

615
00:49:19,273 --> 00:49:22,242
But you... you can.

616
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:36,047
You know, I think that
crazy pink plastic bird might be right.

617
00:49:36,157 --> 00:49:38,625
What if we never went back?

618
00:49:38,693 --> 00:49:41,924
Never go back? But what about my dad?

619
00:49:41,963 --> 00:49:44,124
And Nanette? And the Red garden?

620
00:49:44,198 --> 00:49:47,099
You see, the truth is,
over there, we're enemies.

621
00:49:47,168 --> 00:49:50,228
But here? Here, we're a matching pair.

622
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:57,276
Juliet, will you stay here
and build a garden with me?

623
00:49:57,311 --> 00:49:59,245
I'd love to.

624
00:50:30,645 --> 00:50:32,636
Gnomeo!

625
00:50:34,015 --> 00:50:35,676
What are you doing?!

626
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:40,712
Benny! Listen, mate, I can explain.

627
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:42,153
Benny! Benny, wait!

628
00:50:48,696 --> 00:50:53,861
Well, well, well.
If it isn't little Big Hat Benny!

629
00:50:54,669 --> 00:50:57,934
Mess with our garden, will you?

630
00:51:04,378 --> 00:51:05,970
Benny!

631
00:51:06,848 --> 00:51:08,475
No!

632
00:51:13,588 --> 00:51:15,715
Ooh! That felt good.

633
00:51:16,524 --> 00:51:18,754
Oh, no. Oh, no!

634
00:51:20,628 --> 00:51:21,890
Tybalt!

635
00:51:27,068 --> 00:51:28,433
A hat for a hat!

636
00:51:31,506 --> 00:51:32,996
Gnomeo, no!

637
00:51:45,753 --> 00:51:48,984
You wouldn't attack
an unarmed gnome, would you?

638
00:51:50,224 --> 00:51:51,691
Sucker!

639
00:51:53,094 --> 00:51:54,322
Pity!

640
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:58,059
Tybalt! The wall!

641
00:51:58,099 --> 00:52:02,229
You don't think I'm going to fall
for that old trick, do you? What wall?

642
00:52:07,842 --> 00:52:09,605
Oh. That wall.

643
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:12,141
No.

644
00:52:14,448 --> 00:52:16,348
- What was that?
- What's happened?

645
00:52:20,788 --> 00:52:22,221
Tybalt?

646
00:52:22,256 --> 00:52:25,817
Tybalt. Tybalt?

647
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:32,161
Tybalt can't be with us anymore.

648
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:42,171
Ooh.

649
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:44,074
Smash him back!

650
00:52:44,612 --> 00:52:45,840
No!

651
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:48,177
What is the meaning
of all this constipation?

652
00:52:48,249 --> 00:52:50,274
Gnomeo smashed Tybalt!

653
00:52:50,351 --> 00:52:52,581
- No! He didn't do it!
- Juliet!

654
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:53,985
- Gnomeo!
- Mum!

655
00:52:54,055 --> 00:52:56,250
A gnome for a gnome!

656
00:52:57,625 --> 00:52:59,684
- Catch!
- What?

657
00:53:05,967 --> 00:53:07,798
Smash him back!

658
00:53:08,302 --> 00:53:10,634
Run, Gnomeo! Run!

659
00:53:13,307 --> 00:53:14,672
Stop! Stop that!

660
00:53:24,919 --> 00:53:26,511
Revenge!

661
00:53:27,755 --> 00:53:29,222
Oh?

662
00:53:46,073 --> 00:53:48,200
Oh...

663
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:05,590
- What are you doing?
- No! I love him!

664
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,128
- What?
- Doomed.

665
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:09,789
Oh! Someone do something.

666
00:54:17,972 --> 00:54:19,599
Gnomeo!

667
00:54:20,775 --> 00:54:22,265
Are you mad?

668
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:24,538
There's been enough
smashing for one day!

669
00:54:24,578 --> 00:54:28,810
Now get her on her pedestal
and keep her there!

670
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:30,544
He's gone.

671
00:54:30,584 --> 00:54:33,280
Oh, no... gone.

672
00:54:36,524 --> 00:54:39,891
Oh, Gnomeo. No...

673
00:54:39,927 --> 00:54:42,760
No, not Gnomeo.

674
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:44,388
Let's get you home, now.

675
00:54:44,465 --> 00:54:47,628
Oh! My poor, poor boy.

676
00:55:12,493 --> 00:55:14,518
Hmm?

677
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,928
Stay. Stay!

678
00:55:17,965 --> 00:55:19,057
Good boy!

679
00:55:21,435 --> 00:55:23,903
Shroom! Shroom!

680
00:56:10,217 --> 00:56:12,583
Huh?

681
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:22,126
No!

682
00:56:34,842 --> 00:56:37,174
Hey, what's this? A gnome?

683
00:56:37,244 --> 00:56:39,212
Yeah, mate.
It looks like your sister.

684
00:56:42,049 --> 00:56:43,880
Whoa! Don't drop it!

685
00:56:45,619 --> 00:56:47,314
Come on, pass it!

686
00:57:06,841 --> 00:57:09,435
You left me no choice, Juliet.

687
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:13,310
I've lost your mother.
I am not going to lose you.

688
00:58:33,794 --> 00:58:36,160
Psst! Psst! Bunnies! Fall in.

689
00:58:36,964 --> 00:58:41,264
All right. We've got to avenge Gnomeo.
Here's what we're going to do. Now...

690
00:58:43,904 --> 00:58:45,599
No, not now, Shroom!

691
00:58:47,508 --> 00:58:48,873
Right. Got it!

692
00:59:04,325 --> 00:59:07,351
OK. OK! Little mushroom dude,
I'm coming.

693
00:59:07,428 --> 00:59:09,419
What? What are you trying to say?

694
00:59:10,998 --> 00:59:13,762
So, Little Timmy has fallen
down the well?

695
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:15,428
No? Little John?

696
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:17,835
Little Mustafa? Little Richard? What?!

697
00:59:21,442 --> 00:59:24,434
Oh. Ateapot fell down the well.

698
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,440
What?

699
00:59:28,549 --> 00:59:30,380
Gnomeo.

700
00:59:30,451 --> 00:59:33,249
You saying Gnomeo fell down the well?

701
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,847
No, little mushroom, he was smashed.

702
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:38,790
I saw it myself.

703
00:59:40,995 --> 00:59:44,226
What? You want I still should
follow you some more. OK, fine.

704
00:59:44,298 --> 00:59:49,326
I going with you. I go. But what this
has to do with Gnomeo, I don't know.

705
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:52,237
And where is this well
everyone is falling into?

706
01:00:02,883 --> 01:00:05,215
Psst!

707
01:00:12,126 --> 01:00:13,593
Hmm?

708
01:00:17,865 --> 01:00:19,730
Ready?

709
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:28,204
Ew.

710
01:00:28,242 --> 01:00:30,608
Hmm?

711
01:00:32,413 --> 01:00:34,278
Yuck!

712
01:00:37,818 --> 01:00:38,944
Hmm?

713
01:00:44,358 --> 01:00:46,519
Ooh! Hello.

714
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:59,372
Whoa!

715
01:01:14,521 --> 01:01:16,148
Hmm?

716
01:01:54,561 --> 01:01:55,789
<i>Meow.</i>

717
01:02:00,134 --> 01:02:02,500
<i>Terrafirminator!</i>

718
01:02:02,569 --> 01:02:05,629
- <i>Are you losing the war in your garden?</i>
- Never!

719
01:02:05,672 --> 01:02:08,163
<i>Well, brother,</i>
<i>maybe it's time for a secret weapon!</i>

720
01:02:08,242 --> 01:02:11,734
- Bring it on.
- <i>Terrafirminator!</i>

721
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:13,939
This one's for Gnomeo!

722
01:02:14,782 --> 01:02:16,545
<i>Meow!</i>

723
01:02:56,990 --> 01:02:59,117
Huh?

724
01:02:59,927 --> 01:03:01,451
Yeah!

725
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:04,361
Huh?

726
01:03:08,902 --> 01:03:10,369
Come on!

727
01:03:13,574 --> 01:03:15,599
Oh! Ruddy purse.

728
01:03:24,251 --> 01:03:25,616
Call me.

729
01:03:28,322 --> 01:03:32,884
So Juliet and me, we decided
that we'd carry on in spite of the feud.

730
01:03:32,926 --> 01:03:36,020
It was great, but then my best mate
Benny found out,

731
01:03:36,063 --> 01:03:38,793
and then Tybalt,
who's a right piece of work by the way,

732
01:03:38,866 --> 01:03:40,959
crashed a trowel through Benny's hat.

733
01:03:41,034 --> 01:03:45,801
I was so livid that I attacked Tybalt
and he ended up getting smashed,

734
01:03:45,873 --> 01:03:49,502
which wasn't my fault,
and I was chased out.

735
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:55,045
Exiled. Stuck up here on your head,
far away from Juliet.

736
01:03:56,683 --> 01:03:58,116
Extraordinary.

737
01:03:58,151 --> 01:04:02,781
Your story, it does
put me in mind of another.

738
01:04:02,823 --> 01:04:03,983
It does?

739
01:04:04,057 --> 01:04:07,322
Oh! Indeed! Yes, there are
remarkable similarities.

740
01:04:07,394 --> 01:04:09,055
What happens?
Do they get back together then?

741
01:04:09,096 --> 01:04:13,465
Get back together?
Um... No, not exactly.

742
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,263
What exactly do you mean?

743
01:04:15,302 --> 01:04:18,965
Well now, it really is quite good.

744
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:21,132
She feigns her death.

745
01:04:21,174 --> 01:04:25,133
He finds her, thinks her dead,
takes his own life.

746
01:04:25,178 --> 01:04:28,841
She wakes, finds him dead,
takes her life, both dead.

747
01:04:28,916 --> 01:04:33,683
<i>Exeunt omnes,</i> the end, curtain!
Standing ovation!

748
01:04:33,754 --> 01:04:37,485
Bravo! Bravo! Author! Author!

749
01:04:38,725 --> 01:04:39,885
Hmm.

750
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,520
What did you say?!
They both die?!

751
01:04:42,596 --> 01:04:44,427
What kind of an ending is that?

752
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:46,364
My dear boy, this is a tragedy.

753
01:04:46,433 --> 01:04:48,526
Yeah, you're telling me, mate.
It's rubbish!

754
01:04:48,602 --> 01:04:51,002
- "Rubbish"?
- Gotta be a better ending than that!

755
01:04:51,071 --> 01:04:54,336
I suppose that he could've
made it back in time

756
01:04:54,408 --> 01:04:58,845
to avert disaster,
but I like the whole death part better.

757
01:04:59,346 --> 01:05:00,711
Oh, dear.

758
01:05:07,621 --> 01:05:08,918
Whoo-hoo!

759
01:05:08,989 --> 01:05:10,684
Featherstone!

760
01:05:11,558 --> 01:05:12,855
One word!

761
01:05:14,094 --> 01:05:15,561
Plastic.

762
01:05:15,629 --> 01:05:17,460
How did you find me? Shroom!

763
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:21,331
He sniffed you out.
And he doesn't have a nose. I checked.

764
01:05:21,368 --> 01:05:23,700
Yeah, I knew I could count on you,
you little button head!

765
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:26,170
What is it, boy?

766
01:05:26,206 --> 01:05:29,004
He hasn't stopped, yakety-yakety-yak!

767
01:05:29,042 --> 01:05:31,033
He's been going on and on and on
since the alley.

768
01:05:31,111 --> 01:05:34,569
Chocolates in stranger, chocolates
in stranger, chocolates in stranger...

769
01:05:34,648 --> 01:05:36,479
Juliet's in danger?!

770
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:40,282
No, that's not it. Juliet's in danger!

771
01:05:40,354 --> 01:05:41,514
Told you so.

772
01:05:41,555 --> 01:05:45,218
Come on, boys. I've got to get
back to Juliet and save her!

773
01:05:45,258 --> 01:05:49,217
That's what he said,
but she was dead before he got home!

774
01:05:49,262 --> 01:05:51,059
We'll see about that!

775
01:05:53,934 --> 01:05:55,765
Whoa!

776
01:06:15,689 --> 01:06:16,849
Ta-da!

777
01:06:20,494 --> 01:06:21,927
Benny.

778
01:06:21,962 --> 01:06:25,659
What do you think, Lady B?
This baby is fully equipped.

779
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:26,926
Equipped for what?

780
01:06:26,967 --> 01:06:30,801
It has settings for edging,
trimming, mulching,

781
01:06:30,871 --> 01:06:32,566
and revenge!

782
01:06:35,509 --> 01:06:38,876
Do it, Benny. Do anything it takes!

783
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:42,473
Make them rue
the day they destroyed my son!

784
01:06:44,651 --> 01:06:47,950
Unleash the dogs of war!

785
01:06:56,663 --> 01:07:01,623
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

786
01:07:01,668 --> 01:07:04,466
<i>five, four, three,</i>

787
01:07:04,538 --> 01:07:07,006
<i>two, one!</i>

788
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,376
No! No!

789
01:07:26,927 --> 01:07:28,019
Oh!

790
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:32,295
Yes!

791
01:07:37,571 --> 01:07:39,163
Oh, no!

792
01:07:40,707 --> 01:07:42,675
Oh, blimey!

793
01:07:49,316 --> 01:07:51,216
Oh, no!

794
01:07:55,489 --> 01:07:57,150
Attack!

795
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:59,090
Counterattack!

796
01:08:00,494 --> 01:08:02,052
Counter-counterattack!

797
01:08:07,934 --> 01:08:10,402
- Fire!
- Incoming!

798
01:08:17,878 --> 01:08:19,539
Hey! I got one!

799
01:08:19,613 --> 01:08:21,103
Thank you!

800
01:08:25,819 --> 01:08:27,218
Move it!

801
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:28,984
No!

802
01:08:34,227 --> 01:08:36,252
No! Paris!

803
01:08:42,068 --> 01:08:45,560
Gentlemen, I suggest
we put our heads together. Charge!

804
01:08:50,677 --> 01:08:54,010
- Oh, no, no, no!
- Yee-haw!

805
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:59,215
- Hang on!
- Whoa!

806
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:05,157
Whoa!

807
01:09:06,126 --> 01:09:07,821
Thanks!

808
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:16,459
Juliet!

809
01:09:17,771 --> 01:09:19,432
You're alive!

810
01:09:19,472 --> 01:09:22,305
- Come with me.
- OK.

811
01:09:22,776 --> 01:09:23,902
Oh, no.

812
01:09:27,714 --> 01:09:29,079
No, no!

813
01:09:39,893 --> 01:09:41,918
<i>Would you like</i>
<i>a complete destruction now?</i>

814
01:09:41,962 --> 01:09:43,327
<i>Destruction in progress.</i>

815
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:58,073
Get him! Come on! Come on!

816
01:10:01,581 --> 01:10:03,276
Come on, come on, come on!

817
01:10:25,272 --> 01:10:26,864
Juliet!

818
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:29,033
My son! It can't be.

819
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:33,536
<i>Target locked.</i>

820
01:10:34,514 --> 01:10:37,540
She's going to blow!
Get back! Get back!

821
01:10:48,762 --> 01:10:49,922
It's no use.

822
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:51,657
Go.

823
01:10:53,566 --> 01:10:56,729
- Go.
- I'm not going anywhere.

824
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,477
Told you so.

825
01:11:42,549 --> 01:11:44,278
Huh?

826
01:12:03,837 --> 01:12:05,202
No.

827
01:12:31,331 --> 01:12:32,821
Huh?

828
01:12:36,336 --> 01:12:38,327
It's OK! I'm OK!

829
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:41,903
Oh, good.

830
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:48,012
I'm sorry about your son.

831
01:12:48,815 --> 01:12:51,306
I'm sorry about your daughter.

832
01:12:51,351 --> 01:12:54,912
I was just trying to keep her safe.

833
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:59,653
And now, the whole thing is my fault.

834
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:03,327
Our fault.

835
01:13:23,583 --> 01:13:25,847
This feud...

836
01:13:25,919 --> 01:13:27,546
Is over.

837
01:13:38,465 --> 01:13:39,625
Move!

838
01:14:22,842 --> 01:14:24,776
I don't know about you, but...

839
01:14:24,844 --> 01:14:27,369
I think this ending is much better.

840
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:40,423
- Good afternoon, witch.
- Nitwit!

841
01:16:56,929 --> 01:16:58,829
Thank you!
