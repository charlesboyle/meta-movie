1
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,910
<i>This is Detective Jack Mosley.
Shield number 227.</i>

2
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,290
<i>I guess this will be
my last will and testament.</i>

3
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,520
<i>This is for Diane.</i>

4
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,560
<i>When this day is over, they're gonna come
and talk to you about this...</i>

5
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,930
<i>...and they're gonna... They're gonna
tell you what happened, Diane.</i>

6
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,200
<i>But what they tell you
is not really what happened here.</i>

7
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,340
<i>So I hope that you get this.</i>

8
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,140
<i>I was trying to do a good thing.</i>

9
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,930
Police! Get down! Everybody, down!

10
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,230
Down! Get down!

11
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,400
Go, go, go! Come on!

12
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,740
- Clear.
- Police. Get down.

13
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,280
Seal it off.

14
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,280
Agent 10-10, we're all secure.

15
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,810
All right, we're out of here.

16
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,480
It's clear.

17
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,820
You smell that?

18
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,200
Couple hours. We gotta move now.
Would you turn that thing off?

19
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,630
All right, who's downstairs
we don't need?

20
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,450
It's all yours. Good luck.

21
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,450
I hate to do this, Jack, but I need you
to sit on this until uniforms get here.

22
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,960
- All right.
- Just hang until you're relieved.

23
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,620
All right.

24
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,130
Don't touch anything.

25
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,970
Any word on the suspects?

26
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,380
- What do you want me to tell you?
- What did you tell them?

27
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,640
I saw someone out there.

28
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,750
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

29
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,890
- Anything for me?
- Breath mints.

30
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,970
Sergeant Cannova called.
Wants you to write up this wire request.

31
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,570
Said to make sure
you get the right dates on them.

32
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,330
The particulars are on your desk,
and he needs it by tonight.

33
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,370
All right.

34
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,980
All right, well, we can have an officer
come by about 8 a.m. tomorrow.

35
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,890
You gave her two?

36
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,500
Well, you know, we do what we can.

37
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,140
Hey, Jack, I forgot to tell you,
the lieutenant's looking for you.

38
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,280
He wants you to find him right away.

39
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,910
Yeah, yeah.

40
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,780
Well, listen.
All right, well, I'll call you.

41
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,520
Hey, Mosley.

42
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,320
- Mosley.
- Yeah.

43
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,430
Grace tell you to find me?

44
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,570
- Yeah, just a minute ago.
- All right, need a favor.

45
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,360
Get this guy from lockup
and run him to Center Street.

46
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,270
The DA needs him ASAP. He's gotta be
in front of a grand jury before 10.

47
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,040
I signed out.

48
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,940
You signed the sheet?

49
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,650
Well, not technically, no.
But I mean, I'm signed out.

50
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,410
Then consider yourself on overtime.

51
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,890
Captain Gruber called.
We need this thing done.

52
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,220
Don't you got some mutt
that takes care of this?

53
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:08,120
I got Keenan, but he's still on the Verrazano.
He's behind some overturned truck.

54
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,400
I'm tired. I mean, look, normally,
you know me, I don't say no.

55
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,560
I know you been
working all night, Jack...

56
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,330
...but who's the detective
and who's the lieutenant here?

57
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,770
I mean, Jack, I got nobody else.

58
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,880
It's a nothing thing.

59
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,500
One hundred and eighteen minutes
to get a little hemorrhoid 16 blocks.

60
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,550
I'll let you come in
to work late tomorrow.

61
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,410
Yeah, yeah.

62
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,080
Edward Bunker.

63
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,750
Yeah, that's me, officer.
Eddie Bunker, right here.

64
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,080
Down here, the last cell.

65
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,920
- Come back in an hour.
- What do you mean, come back?

66
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,220
He's supposed to wear a suit
when he leaves.

67
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,700
- And?
- It's not here yet.

68
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,270
Just get him out here, all right?

69
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,160
They said he'd wear a suit.

70
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,240
No, yeah, I'm supposed to get a suit.
It's a three-piece suit. It's gray.

71
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,810
It's got... Wait. Yeah.

72
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,970
It's a three-button, it's gray,
it's got cuffs on the pants.

73
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,980
They brought the catalogue down.
I picked it out of the catalogue.

74
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,120
I'm not supposed
to leave without it. Wait.

75
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,380
I'm not supposed to leave
without that suit.

76
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,220
- You tell it to him.
- No, that's why you brought my shoelaces.

77
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,190
- Come on, come on.
- I'm not supposed to.

78
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,330
- Yo, yo, you take the old lady, right?
- Yeah, you sure?

79
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,830
The old lady goes into the car,
otherwise she dies.

80
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,230
- You think so?
- Yeah, man.

81
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,170
That's what... I don't know. You gotta
figure out the answer for yourself.

82
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,000
Everybody just calm down.
Officer, I'm going to court.

83
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,800
- I'm supposed to have a suit.
- Hey.

84
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,170
Shut up. Here's your property.

85
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,610
- It's not a good sign.
- Hands behind your back.

86
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,940
- Hold on, I'm trying...
- Hands behind your back.

87
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,350
I don't even have my...
All my prop... Wait one minute.

88
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,480
It's not right.
They promised me the suit.

89
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,780
I picked it out of the catalogue...
Wait, my book.

90
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,050
I can't leave without my book.
My book is very important to me.

91
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,260
Why are we rushing like this?
It's not a good sign.

92
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,460
- Hey.
- What's the damn answer?

93
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,000
- Hey!
- Shut up.

94
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,640
- I hate police.
- Half a tank.

95
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,440
You could have had
a little more patience.

96
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,980
This suit don't mean nothing to you.
You probably got a bunch of suits.

97
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,850
But it's a whole different thing to me.

98
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,160
These cars don't ever change, huh?

99
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,390
Traditional cruisers.

100
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,540
And the same retarded hump
in the middle.

101
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,010
Smell the same way,
like Lysol and vomit.

102
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,310
I hope nobody vomited back here.
They probably did.

103
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,720
Hey, man, let me ask you something.

104
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,230
I'm trying to figure this out.

105
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,430
You driving along
in your hurricane, right?

106
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,970
There's three people at the bus stop.

107
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,160
Yeah, one is an old lady.
She's sick, she about to die.

108
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,930
The second one is your best friend.

109
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,240
He saved your life, right?

110
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,780
And the third is the girl of your dreams.

111
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,940
Right, but check it out...

112
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,410
...you only got space in the car
for one person.

113
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,620
Right? Who you take?

114
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,990
It's a riddle that's supposed to tell
what type of person you are...

115
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,750
...like where you at in your life.

116
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,490
It's a hypothetical question, man, damn.

117
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,000
It's just a hypothetical...

118
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,800
Well, good. Fine, good.
I guess that's my answer.

119
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,740
Why don't you get
on the loudspeaker?

120
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,790
Put the Hawaii Five - 0 light on
or something.

121
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,080
Use your police power.
Put on a little siren.

122
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,060
Make room, make a hole.

123
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,090
Isn't that the saying,
"Make a hole, make a hole"?

124
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,390
Go on, make a hole.

125
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:47,240
Signs. Everywhere, signs, signs, signs.
All over, man.

126
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,900
I used to not even see
nothing like that, man.

127
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,520
And then I start seeing them.
And I start looking for them.

128
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,110
And everything just start falling in place.

129
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,350
I'm gonna be all right,
where I'm supposed to be.

130
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:06,550
I ain't got my suit,
but once they get my testimony...

131
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,090
...they drop my charges, I'm free.

132
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,700
It's making sense to me.

133
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,030
I believe in that.

134
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,860
Being in the right place.

135
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,870
Being where you supposed to be.
You believe in that?

136
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,030
I believe life's too long
and guys like you make it even longer.

137
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,350
Life's too long?

138
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,380
Damn.

139
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,480
That's some cold shit, man. I ain't never
heard nobody say no shit like that.

140
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,790
Usually you hear about people
trying to make their life longer, you know?

141
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,520
Trying to stay alive a little longer.
You sound a little...

142
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,990
...depressed or something, you all right?

143
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,460
You stopping?

144
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,230
This ain't the courthouse, man.
What you doing?

145
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,470
Yo.

146
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,040
Yo, why you stopping?

147
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,550
You gonna rush me out to court,
and now you stopping? What are you...?

148
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,880
Hey. Hey, man.

149
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,850
Hey, man. Listen, man, I got an important
appointment after my court date, man.

150
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,790
That shit ain't funny, man.
Come on, man. It's not a game, man.

151
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,520
Yo.

152
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,390
Some bullshit, man.

153
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,360
Hey. Hey!

154
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,100
No, man. It ain't Miller Time, man.

155
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,340
<i>The weather will be clear early morning,
but the rest of the day...</i>

156
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,410
Sam. Hey, Angela.

157
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,990
<i>So we are looking at a hot, humid day.</i>

158
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,420
<i>Looks like temperature
might reach 100 degrees...</i>

159
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,490
<i>...so don't forget
to pack your sunscreen.</i>

160
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,350
Add a pack of these, will you?

161
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:49,050
I know this dude smelled funny.
I got the wrong dude, man.

162
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,200
- 17,50.
- What?

163
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,670
Hey, don't open it. Come over here.

164
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,540
What time is it, man?

165
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,470
It's 8:11.

166
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,940
That's a good sign. That's a good sign.

167
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,910
I'm on my way. I'm gonna get there.

168
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,180
- Want change?
- No, you keep the change.

169
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,850
Keep the change.
All right, you have a good day.

170
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,320
- I don't want the peanuts.
- Bye.

171
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,920
No, man. Can't do nothing for you,
understand?

172
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,660
Hey, you better give me that change.
I'm gonna need that.

173
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,390
You see my situation right here?

174
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,930
No, no, no! No, no, no!

175
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,240
Hey!

176
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,150
How am I supposed to get out?

177
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,140
- Come on.
- Help me. Help me.

178
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:03,000
- My book. Why did you stop?
- Go, left, go. Left.

179
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,030
Move. Move. Move.

180
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,860
Wait. Freeze!

181
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,300
In here. Come on.

182
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,540
Shit.

183
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,670
Hey!

184
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,910
Just get out of here, now!
Go on. Go!

185
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,080
Come on, let's go.
That way, let's go. Go, go.

186
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,720
Ready? Here.

187
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,960
Let's go. Go.

188
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:48,400
- Dominic, get people out of here, right now.
- Jesus, Jackie. What's going on?

189
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,870
- Everybody. You too.
- All right, okay.

190
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,680
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on, come on.

191
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,350
Hey, yo.

192
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,490
Come on, keep going. Come on.
Come on, move it.

193
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:10,160
Yeah, this is Detective Jack Mosley,
shield number 227.

194
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:13,600
I am 10-13, at... Hold on a minute.

195
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,760
- Dominic, what's the address here?
- 133 Mulberry.

196
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,840
133 Mulberry.

197
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,600
Mulberry Street.

198
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,680
All right.

199
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,120
Is they coming?

200
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,730
I don't know why you stopped, man.

201
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,030
I don't know why
you would do that, man.

202
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,000
They said you were nobody.

203
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,900
- I ain't nobody.
- Shut up.

204
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,050
You a wino. You need to stop drinking,
that's what you need stop doin'.

205
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,380
Shut up.

206
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,860
Jack?

207
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,730
- Frank.
- Hey.

208
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,760
You all right?

209
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,490
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

210
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,470
We were on Mott when the call went out.
Heard it was you.

211
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,740
Got here as soon as we could.

212
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,880
Oh, hi.

213
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,580
- Hey.
- You all right?

214
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,220
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- You having fun?

215
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,350
- No.
- No? Oh, well.

216
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,690
Gotta have fun.

217
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,400
- What's up, Jack?
- Hey, man. Hi.

218
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,700
You did a really great, great job, man.

219
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,070
You got yourself a bad guy.

220
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,600
Been a while, huh? Yeah.

221
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:09,940
We got the second shooter
half a block from here, so it's done.

222
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,590
- Sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

223
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,210
I'm just getting my wind. I was running.

224
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,760
Why don't you let us take it from here.

225
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,230
Oh, yeah.

226
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,960
We'll get the kid where he belongs,
and you don't have to worry about a thing.

227
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,360
- We'll get you home.
- Yes, please.

228
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,100
Please, please, officer.
That's a very good idea...

229
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,210
...because, honestly, I don't think
this dude is doing too good.

230
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,610
I told him not to stop.

231
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,270
I asked him not to stop.
He just had to stop.

232
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,140
That's when everything happened.
Dude came to the window.

233
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,810
I have a very important
appointment aft...

234
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,420
Jack.

235
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,790
Hey, Shue.

236
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,490
Come on. Here.

237
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,190
Why don't you take this. Come on.

238
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,960
We'll get you out of here.
Got a car waiting. All right?

239
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,570
Get some sleep.

240
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,570
Jack?

241
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:46,010
The kid was gonna testify against Jerry.

242
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,180
He saw Jerry doing some business.

243
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:55,220
Now, we both know that Jerry has never
been a standup guy like you and me.

244
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,220
He'll roll over, they indict him.
We can't have that.

245
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,990
No. It's gonna hurt a lot of us.

246
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,370
Come on.

247
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:23,880
See, this whole thing caught us...
It caught us completely unaware.

248
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,950
It was supposed to be
Teach's nephew driving him.

249
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,650
But he got stuck out there in traffic,
who knows where...

250
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,820
...so then your lieutenant, he pegged you.

251
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:43,060
You know, just the wrong time
and the wrong place for you today.

252
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:49,840
All right. Now, you know that I would never
put you in a position like this, right?

253
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,040
You know that, huh?

254
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,240
And I never figured
you'd cap one of those guys.

255
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,980
- That's what I get for hiring drug addicts.
- Grab the gun.

256
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,050
Grab the gun. There you go.

257
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,550
Come on. Frank?

258
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,790
- Here we go.
- All right, here we go. Jack.

259
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,270
Squeeze the trigger.

260
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:22,200
All right. Let go of the gun.
Let go of the gun.

261
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,750
I figure it like this.

262
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,780
You... You pop the guys
trying to spring the kid.

263
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,720
The kid, well, he gets your gun.

264
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,520
And he takes you hostage.

265
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,130
So we came in and saved the day.

266
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,590
He died, you lived.

267
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,060
Now, this could be a good thing
for you, Jack.

268
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,640
Get you back where you belong.

269
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,440
- Are you still with?
- Stand up.

270
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,020
- You still with what's-her-name?
- Come on, stand up.

271
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:10,480
- What are you waiting for?
- What's her name?

272
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,770
Caroline.

273
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,640
It's Caroline.

274
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,840
This changes everything, Jack.

275
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,680
Over here.

276
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,250
Come on, Frank.

277
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,800
Kid, get up. Come on.

278
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,740
Shit. Man, shit.

279
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,810
All right, Jack, it's 8:25.

280
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,720
- You stay there.
- Listen to me, the jury's tenure ends at 10.

281
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,590
All right? The kid gets there
one minute past, all this...

282
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,630
...it doesn't matter.

283
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,570
And all you gotta do
is look the other way.

284
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,670
All right? We still got options here.

285
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,140
Okay?

286
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,540
We just want the kid.

287
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,210
Jack, Jack, Jack,
just let me help you.

288
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,910
All right?

289
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,710
Back up.

290
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,980
Jack, once you go out that door...

291
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,120
...I can't help you.

292
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:55,420
Please just back up, Frank.
Just back up.

293
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,110
He shot a cop.

294
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,980
What the hell did you see?
What did you see?

295
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,920
That cop back there.

296
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,720
I seen him around my way...

297
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,920
...holding a gun in this
little Puerto Rican kid's mouth.

298
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,890
Come on. Let's go.

299
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,160
He said he'd kill his mother
if he testified.

300
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,260
What you doing that for?
We need that.

301
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,740
The shell in that gun was over 20 years old.
Lucky it went off at all.

302
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,970
- They didn't tell you Shue was a cop?
- No, they didn't tell me he was a cop.

303
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,240
They showed me a picture, that was it.
They didn't say nothin'.

304
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:48,470
Well, congratulations, because you're about
to testify against one of New York's worst.

305
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,620
- What?
- Fellas, look, the clock's ticking.

306
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,910
He's gotta be at the courthouse by 10.
We know where he's going.

307
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,450
Mulvey, you're coming with me.

308
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,080
- Know where you're going?
- Take the north side.

309
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,890
- You got it, let's go.
- Come on.

310
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,960
- Captain.
- Where are we, Frank?

311
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,930
Well, we're putting descriptions out
over precinct channels.

312
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,940
No names, or that one's a cop.
It'll help to have some eyes.

313
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:16,000
- How long can you sit on this?
- He shot a cop.

314
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,470
You're the precinct captain, Dan.
How long?

315
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,710
I don't know.
Hour, maybe a little more.

316
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,940
- Who's on this with you?
- My guys.

317
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,320
Ortiz and Maldonado from the 66.
Touhey and Kaller from the 111.

318
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,520
A couple others
you don't wanna know about.

319
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,160
The guy was your partner for 20 years.

320
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,660
What the hell happened in there?

321
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,100
- Is he drunk?
- I don't know.

322
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,730
I don't know. We woke him up.

323
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:49,540
Hopefully he'll do what he always does,
and we can go back to work.

324
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,580
If he doesn't?

325
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:58,580
We gotta quash this thing
before he gets his legs back.

326
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,380
These are his streets.

327
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,360
This could get ugly for all of us
if that kid talks.

328
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,860
- He can't talk.
- He won't talk.

329
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,830
Look, I appreciate
what you did for me back there...

330
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,660
...but I'm starting to think
you're not the dude for this.

331
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,470
I mean, you're out of breath,
you're hung-over.

332
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,900
Your leg is gonna give out on you
any second, man.

333
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,380
I got someplace I need to be at 12,
you understand?

334
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,450
I need to be finished at court by 10...

335
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,010
...or I'm not gonna get
where I'm supposed to get.

336
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,050
- You understand what I'm saying?
- All right, I understand.

337
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,660
- You're not listening to what I'm saying.
- Wait, come here. Come here.

338
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,850
Come on.

339
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,300
Hung-over.

340
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,260
A bad leg.

341
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,230
No gun.

342
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,600
- Bobby?
- Yeah?

343
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,610
<i>- You thinking what I'm thinking?</i>
- I'm already there.

344
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,100
Oh, God.

345
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,770
Come on, let's go.

346
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,640
Listen, just stay put right here.
I'll be right back.

347
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,150
Come on, man, don't take long.
We gotta go.

348
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,250
Hurry up.

349
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,200
- Hey, man, where your bathroom?
- What?

350
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,230
Your bathroom. Where your bathroom at?

351
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,590
Down at the end of the hall.

352
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,430
Yeah.

353
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,560
That's what you look like
when you smile, huh?

354
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,670
You was probably drinking then too.

355
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,480
There's the lady.

356
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,280
Redhead. She cute. That ain't bad.

357
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,720
Hey, man. Come on, don't be stopping
to get high or nothing like that.

358
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,760
Man, we gotta go.

359
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,860
Make sure you lift the seat up
before you go.

360
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,030
It's up already.

361
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:34,030
Maybe you left it like that, huh?

362
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,440
I'm coming.

363
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,830
Hey, Jack.

364
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,470
Jack Mosley.

365
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,640
Why did you do that?

366
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,700
Do what?

367
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,150
Shoot that cop.

368
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,440
Cops...

369
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,280
...they don't shoot other cops.

370
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,620
Especially over nobody like me.

371
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:12,330
It's a long way to go for a stranger,
you know.

372
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,600
Thank you.

373
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,610
I never had nobody...

374
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,610
Hell, man, you know.

375
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,380
I don't rock with the police,
you know what I'm saying?

376
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,090
- Finger off the trigger.
- They never been my friend.

377
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,980
- Then here you come.
- On the ground.

378
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,060
It's kind of bugging me out, you know.

379
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,890
You on some vigilante business.

380
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,530
Let's go.

381
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,330
- Jack...
- Put your arms around the pole.

382
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,090
I don't know what to think anymore.

383
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:45,570
- Here. Cuff yourself.
- What are you doing, Jack?

384
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,730
Yeah, it's a little strange.

385
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,380
You know? By any definition, this here.

386
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,310
All right, kid. Good.

387
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,040
Okay.

388
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,910
Okay, okay, okay.

389
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,020
Okay.

390
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,550
Okay.

391
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:07,320
You should have done
what you always do, Jack.

392
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:12,030
- Where's your phone?
- It's on the left-hand side.

393
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,900
They know I'm here.
If I don't answer it...

394
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,510
- Jack?
- Let's go, kid. Come on.

395
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:39,020
- Bob.
<i>- Bob's a little tied up right now, Frank.</i>

396
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,320
<i>All right, I'm impressed, Jack.</i>

397
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,620
Did you shoot him too?

398
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,270
Send someone to check on Bobby.

399
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,170
<i>Jack, you're not up to this.</i>

400
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,240
<i>All right? It's gonna end bad for you.</i>

401
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,510
You lost the kid, didn't you?

402
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,350
<i>He bailed on you.
Well, you know what?</i>

403
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,680
<i>That is the best thing
that could have happened.</i>

404
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,190
<i>So why don't you go home.</i>

405
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,590
Forget about what happened.

406
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,280
We'll take it from here.
Are you looking for him?

407
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,190
<i>And you can't find him.</i>

408
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,460
<i>We're gonna find him, all right?</i>

409
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,230
<i>We're gonna find him.</i>

410
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,130
All right, Jack, now you can hang up.

411
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,870
Where are you, kid?

412
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,870
All right. Now, let's see
which way he went.

413
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,640
Did he go up? Did he go down?

414
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,250
In or out, Jackie.
Which way did he go?

415
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,990
Let's see if he went down.

416
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,250
- Excuse me, sir, do you mind swiping?
- Get a job, man.

417
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,160
Ma'am, would you mind swiping me in?

418
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:51,320
Ma'am? Ma'am, would you mind
swiping me in, please, ma'am?

419
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,560
I have a very important
appointment I have to...

420
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,270
Excuse me, ma'am, would you mind...?
Somebody mind swiping me in?

421
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,670
I'm trying to get
to an important appointment.

422
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,510
Somebody help me. Somebody help me.

423
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,880
Somebody help me.

424
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,820
Hey.

425
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,190
Come here.

426
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,960
- Come on. Go.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

427
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,560
Eddie!

428
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,180
- Oh, no.
- What are you doing?

429
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,180
- Why are you running?
- What do you want?

430
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,610
It's too much, man.
I'm doing the rest on my own.

431
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,110
I'm doing what I said.
I'm getting out of here.

432
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,480
- If I can find you, they can find you!
- I'm doing what I said.

433
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,680
Eddie, listen to me. Listen to me.
Listen to me!

434
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,720
- I'm your only friend down here.
- No, you're not my friend.

435
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:56,130
- I can do this...
- Friend? You don't even know me!

436
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,660
And get me where?
You gonna get me shot.

437
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:02,560
Ever since I've been with you, people been
trying to shoot me. People you know!

438
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,000
Look, man, I got someplace I need to be.
I got something I need to do.

439
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,870
Unless you gonna shoot me or arrest me,
I'm going, Jack.

440
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,170
- I can't let you leave.
- Thank you, Jack Mosley. I'm going.

441
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,810
- You can't leave.
- Yes, I can. Thank you, Jack Mosley.

442
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,710
Stop. Don't do that. Stop.

443
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,280
Ladies and gentlemen...!
You're not going. Come here.

444
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,420
Eddie!

445
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,860
Okay, okay.
Okay, we gotta go.

446
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,520
- Move! Move!
- Get out of the way!

447
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,160
Move! Move!

448
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,130
- Here, come on.
- What are you doing?

449
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,940
Taxi! Hey!

450
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,980
Taxi!

451
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,580
It's Kaller. He just missed them
at the Canal Street station.

452
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,860
Where, where, where?

453
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,180
Shit. Where the hell is he?

454
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,560
Goddamn it.

455
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,930
We're gonna find you.

456
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,690
Yeah, this is Detective Nugent.
I need a triangulation...

457
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:11,900
<i>...on Detective Torres' cell phone.
Area code 917-935...</i>

458
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:20,210
That cop back at the apartment,
he said you should do what you always do.

459
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,040
What did he...?
What did he mean by that?

460
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,020
You're not doing
what you always do, huh?

461
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,990
Jack Mosley, I get it. I see the signs.

462
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,490
I'm where I'm supposed to be.
I was wrong. You're the right guy.

463
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,860
I could have got another guy,
did something different, but I got you.

464
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,800
I appreciate it. You're the right guy.

465
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:40,960
- Okay?
- Okay.

466
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,630
<i>- This is Comtech, over.</i>
- Yeah, go, this is Nugent.

467
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,900
GPS indicates they're on Bowery.

468
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,100
<i>Repeat, Bowery,
moving south towards Pell.</i>

469
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,770
<i>Speed indicates they're on foot.</i>

470
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,040
Are you hearing this, boys?
He's in Chinatown.

471
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,210
Let's move in.

472
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,620
- What's the deal with that book?
- It's my business plans.

473
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,560
I'm moving to Seattle.
My sister's already living out there.

474
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:12,860
I'm gonna open up a bakery.
But it's only, like, a specialty bakery.

475
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,940
Birthday cakes for little kids.
There's a lot of money in that.

476
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,940
I'm gonna send you
a big birthday cake on your birthday...

477
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,570
- I hate birthday cakes.
- You hate birthday cakes?

478
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,540
First thing that doesn't go your way...

479
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:26,480
...you're gonna be slipping into
Carol's Clip and Curl...

480
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,640
...and stealing all her hair-care products.

481
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,340
Because you're a thief.
And that's what you are, Eddie.

482
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,960
- You're always gonna be a thief.
- People can change, Jack.

483
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,110
- Days change, seasons change. Not people.
- Yes, you do...

484
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:41,490
- People don't change, Eddie.
- Yes, you do. I'll get you that cake.

485
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,320
You know what it's gonna say on top?

486
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,400
"Jack Mosley, ha-ha-ha, eat this."
Make you eat your words, lick your fingers too.

487
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,230
Subject's moving west on Pell.

488
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:56,000
Subject now moving south on Doyers.
Still moving south on Doyers.

489
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,740
Bobby, you take Doyer, we got Pell.
And, Kaller, you close up Bowery.

490
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,310
<i>- Copy that.</i>
- Let's squeeze him.

491
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,420
<i>- Copy that, on my way.</i>
- Why don't you pull up. Pull up.

492
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,350
- Sorry.
- Who is that? You can't go in here.

493
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,930
Oh, sorry.

494
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,580
Look, man, I gotta be down there.
All right, you understand?

495
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:18,860
I gotta be down there that way, and
there's streets and shit in between there.

496
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,620
You got some sort of plan?
Some sort of police plan or something?

497
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,600
I see your limp acting up.
You ought to get that checked out.

498
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:29,400
I have a buddy of mine
walking around with a limp just like that.

499
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,830
He don't wanna go
to the doctor, though, right?

500
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,600
Finally he go,
they say it's a fracture, right?

501
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,610
And now it's infected.
They gotta cut it off at the knee.

502
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,570
Wasn't so bad, though.
He had no more pain.

503
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,580
He ended up moving to Jersey,
working for the PATH...

504
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,150
...being a motorman.
Got a pension and shit now.

505
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,880
I guess everything happens for a reason,
you know what I mean?

506
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,460
You're a sunny little shit,
I'll give you that much.

507
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,600
Get in here! Get in that door!

508
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,100
Jack!

509
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:09,470
- Pull me in! Help me in!
- Come on, come on, come on.

510
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,740
Lock the door.

511
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,180
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Hold up.

512
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,520
Come on.

513
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,210
- You all right?
- Yeah.

514
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,600
Jack, what are we doing?
Where are we going?

515
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,150
- Come on.
- Where we going, Jack?

516
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,040
Out of the way.

517
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,650
Over here.

518
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:30,650
Jack? How we even know that Center Street
Courthouse is in this direction, Jack?

519
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,450
Jack? We gotta know...

520
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,330
Down! Head down!

521
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,650
Go!

522
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,660
Come on!

523
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,620
Kaller!

524
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:01,050
Push it.

525
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,980
You all right, Jack?

526
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,350
I was aiming for the kid,
if that makes you feel better.

527
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,460
Well, you missed!

528
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:50,560
That kid is gonna get you killed.

529
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,800
He worth that?

530
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:02,210
Well, I got all day.

531
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,710
How about you, you got all day?

532
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:12,220
- Jack, you still there?
- Yeah.

533
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,930
Still here.

534
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,400
Well, this is awkward.

535
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,860
When I started this day...

536
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,340
...I never figured on trading
9 mils with my friend.

537
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:36,310
I think we stopped being friends
right around 8:25, in that bar.

538
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,640
No.

539
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:44,420
No, that's not gonna erase
20 years together.

540
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,020
We're still friends.

541
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,530
Look...

542
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,870
...a lot I'd take back, but I can't.

543
00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:00,840
Well, so you move forward.
Next day, next case.

544
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:04,100
- Lines were crossed.
- What lines?

545
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:09,510
- You hear me? Lines were crossed, Frank.
- What lines? There are no lines!

546
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:12,410
There's getting it done
and not getting it done, period!

547
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,680
You put the bad guys away
no matter what it takes.

548
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,380
Now, you're gonna ruin the lives...

549
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,050
...of six cops.

550
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:24,830
Good cops.

551
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,800
Good men.

552
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:34,900
Are you ready to sacrifice
their lives for that kid?

553
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,880
Hey, Frank.

554
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,040
- Frank.
- Yeah?

555
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:43,550
This is not about me
ruining anybody's life.

556
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,980
Okay? This is about you.

557
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,820
You hear me?

558
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,420
Yeah.

559
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,420
You look at that kid's jacket?

560
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,590
I did.

561
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,170
- Armed robbery, assault, beats old women...
- I never had no armed robbery!

562
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,460
Beats old women over the heads,
steals their Social Security checks.

563
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,630
- One time, I used...
- Shut up. Shut up.

564
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,670
Oh, no, don't tell him to shut up.

565
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:15,040
No, Jack, listen to him.
No, that kid, he's sharp.

566
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,480
Yeah, he's playing you.

567
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,750
He's sharper than you are.

568
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:23,580
He's telling you stories, right?

569
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,590
He wants to be a good citizen.

570
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:29,160
Go to church.

571
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,790
Buy his mother a house.

572
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:35,830
But he has spent
more than half his life in prison.

573
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:43,100
Two hours ago, he was sitting in a cell
for weapons possession.

574
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,080
- He's always gonna do what he has done.
- I wasn't...

575
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,680
He is a career criminal.
That's who you're protecting.

576
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:55,020
- You all right?
- Yeah. Frank's got him on the other side.

577
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,020
He's got my gun too.

578
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,480
Now, if you can't see
how wrong this is...

579
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:02,650
...I promise you
I will speak from my heart...

580
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,170
...when I give the eulogy at your funeral.

581
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,030
So...

582
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:11,970
...do you believe the kid?

583
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,180
Or do you believe your ex-partner?

584
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,640
Frank, we're right
on the other side of the door.

585
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,580
Because...

586
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,080
...if you believe the kid...

587
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:34,920
...you got a choice to make.

588
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:45,270
Do you go through your ex-partner?

589
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:49,000
Or do you choose door number two...

590
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:54,750
...and go back to where you came,
with your gimpy leg and your shot-up hand?

591
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:07,390
You're not gonna get very far.
And what if your ex-partner is right, Jack?

592
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:11,290
What if he is right, and you're wasting
your whole miserable life?

593
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:32,710
- It's Frank.
- You all right?

594
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:35,550
Yeah. They're in the elevator.
Seal the building.

595
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,120
Come on, Bobby.
Come on, get on that.

596
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,290
Everybody out! Police!

597
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:45,660
Everybody out! Police!
Move, move! Police!

598
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:49,800
- Frank, where are you?
- Bobby, I'm coming up!

599
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:54,100
All right. Come on, come on.
Upstairs. Seal the stairwell.

600
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,610
- All right.
- Find the back stairs. Check the roof.

601
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,340
- Come on, Mal! This way.
- Got you.

602
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:00,880
- Maldonado, seal it up.
- Got you.

603
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,960
Hello? Hello? Hello?

604
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,500
- No, nothing.
- No answer. He's not there. Come on.

605
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:38,020
I never open door.

606
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:41,420
Please. Please, help.

607
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,120
Come on.

608
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,400
Jack, Jack, Jack. Thank you.

609
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,970
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

610
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:00,600
- You saw that, right? You heard him, right?
- Yeah. He never opens the door.

611
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:12,950
Thank you very much, sir. Thank you.

612
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,850
- Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
- Thank you.

613
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:19,190
- You heard him, right, Jack?
- Not now, Eddie.

614
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,520
- Keep your voice down.
- He said he never opens the door.

615
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,190
You know what that mean, right?

616
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,730
Not right now.
There's the signs everywhere.

617
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,840
- Yeah, ADA MacDonald, please.
<i>- May I tell her who's calling?</i>

618
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:36,440
Yeah, tell her it's the guy
that's got her witness.

619
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:46,980
You're driving a car
during a hurricane.

620
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,680
Like...

621
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,880
A hurricane.

622
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:54,120
And there's three people at a bus stop.

623
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,760
- A old woman.
- Yeah.

624
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:59,920
A friend, like my friend here.

625
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:03,300
Him. He save your life, your friend.

626
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,570
It's Detective Mosley for you.

627
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:07,900
- Mosley?
- Yeah?

628
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,870
Where are you?
Where's my witness?

629
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,810
I'm about seven blocks from you.

630
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:14,310
But there's about a ton of cops
between me and you.

631
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,210
And they all want this kid dead.

632
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,880
Not to mention that
you got a leak in your office.

633
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:22,150
- Somebody's talking to these cops.
- Shit.

634
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,990
What did you think was gonna happen
when you pinched Shue?

635
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,630
You thought they'd just lay down
and go away quietly?

636
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,390
We thought if we went to the grand jury,
Shue would fold.

637
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:31,790
He bent but didn't break.

638
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:35,460
<i>We were gonna throw it away until
we ran into Edward Bunker last night.</i>

639
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:40,100
Jury's tenure ends at 10. Without that kid,
they'll vote no bill and it all goes away.

640
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:42,500
<i>He's an eyewitness.
He makes this work.</i>

641
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,410
Where are you? I'll send my squad.
Richard, pen.

642
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:04,930
What room?

643
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:14,540
- So, what, are they coming?
- Yeah, they're coming.

644
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:20,140
Good. Because I gotta be somewhere, man.
I got something to do.

645
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:23,550
I gotta be someplace by noon.
I gotta go get something.

646
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,650
It's real important.

647
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:27,380
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

648
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:30,660
Ortiz, I'm coming in the building.

649
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:33,890
Frank?

650
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,130
- Touhey and Kaller are taken care of.
- Good. Find Bobby. He's on the back stairs.

651
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:44,030
Eddie, come here, put this on.
Here, come on, put that on.

652
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:47,660
But it's a big, hot, wool shirt.
It's hot. It's summer.

653
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,470
- You're dressed like a criminal.
- Oh, you want me to...?

654
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:53,710
You want me to change my...?
I get it. But why can't I put that on?

655
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,470
- What about this?
- What about that?

656
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:58,920
- What's wrong with this? It's just a pattern.
- He don't even wear that.

657
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,420
Just put the... Here.

658
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,350
Never mind. What about this?

659
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,690
Is this all right? Mass-transit blue?

660
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,670
When I was locked up,
they had me work in the kitchen.

661
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:16,270
So one day a little dude
walk up to me and say:

662
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,410
"Hey, you think
you could bake me a cake?"

663
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,340
I said, "Yeah, I'll bake you a cake."

664
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,570
I ain't tell him I ain't never
baked a cake, you know.

665
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,270
But I ain't got shit else to do.

666
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:29,380
So, you know, I read the instructions...

667
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:32,310
...I bake him a cake, you know,
for his daughter's birthday.

668
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,220
She'd come up there to visit him.

669
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:38,380
You know, it say,
"Happy Birthday, Angel," right?

670
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:41,720
He go crazy.
He can't get enough, you know.

671
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:45,420
He said, "Eddie, you done hooked me up.
Man, you the man."

672
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,090
And I started doing that.
It was good. I had a skill.

673
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:50,430
People look at me different.
They would start...

674
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:52,700
- You missed a button.
- Did I?

675
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:54,970
Your buttons are all crooked.

676
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,510
- Come on. Come on, man.
- All right.

677
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:00,010
Nugent.

678
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,610
You're a prince.

679
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:10,450
<i>- The word is 5E, boys, 5E.</i>
- Got it.

680
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,990
Then I start doing my research,
doing my due diligence.

681
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,260
I found out, you know, it's good money
in birthday cakes for kids, you know.

682
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:25,870
That type of thing, like Tweety Bird
or Bugs Bunny or something like that.

683
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,100
Or Yu-Gi-Oh!
You ever heard of Yu-Gi-Oh!?

684
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:33,170
- Yu-Gi-Oh!
- Yu-Gi-Oh! Kids love that, man.

685
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,080
You don't know Yu-Gi-Oh!?
You gotta get out more. Yu-Gi-Oh! is hot.

686
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,480
Know what I'm saying?

687
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:51,160
I'm gonna make money, Jack.
Open up my bakery.

688
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:55,330
You gonna eat your words about me, Jack.
How do I look? Do I look all right?

689
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,800
- All right.
- Freeze! Police!

690
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:01,310
- Police! Police!
- Shut up!

691
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,000
- Oh, my God!
- Shut up!

692
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,470
Frank, they gave us
the wrong apartment.

693
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:12,180
Put it down.

694
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,520
Put it down.

695
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,010
Can't get lucky all the time.

696
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,270
You can be smart every day, though.

697
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:30,170
- All right, give me the gun.
- Hold on.

698
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:32,220
What are you doing?

699
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,720
This place is crawling with cops, Eddie.

700
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:42,660
Hey, look at me.

701
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:47,530
Eddie, what are you doing?

702
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,300
How does it feel?

703
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,140
How does it feel?

704
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,630
You're a baker, right?

705
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:01,810
Eddie, listen to him.

706
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,110
Pull that trigger,
you go to jail for life.

707
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:06,490
<i>Frank, we're on our way down.</i>

708
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:10,220
<i>Frank, do you read me?</i>

709
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:16,090
- You can't stop me, you understand?
- Time to go.

710
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:19,200
- Time to go.
- You can't stop me.

711
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,600
You gave him a loaded weapon?

712
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:29,510
- Frank.
- Bobby, get these things off me.

713
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,270
- Did he take your gun?
- They went south. Get out of here.

714
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:36,750
Ortiz! Ortiz, give me a piece.
Give me a piece! Get over here.

715
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:43,550
Make a hole, make a hole.
Come on, make a hole.

716
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,330
Speak to me.
Come on, somebody, speak to me.

717
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,110
Turn.

718
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,120
- Excuse me!
- Open up!

719
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,490
- Excuse me!
- Open up!

720
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:20,350
Keep moving. Go.
Go, go, go.

721
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:23,960
Oh, shit.

722
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:29,270
On the bus! Let's go.

723
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:36,510
- Just keep driving.
- What are you doing?

724
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:40,140
- I'm a cop. Lock the back door.
- He's got a gun!

725
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:44,350
No stops.
Tell them to hang on to something, Eddie!

726
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:48,610
Hang on! Don't worry, this man,
he's a police officer.

727
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:50,810
- Everything is gonna be fine.
- Hang on!

728
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:52,820
Everybody just hang on. Don't worry!

729
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,430
Right, right, right! Go right!

730
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,670
- What are you doing?
- Stop this thing!

731
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,480
Get down!

732
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:54,190
Get away from the bus!
Away from the bus!

733
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,690
Stay down! Stay down!

734
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,330
Heads down!

735
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,800
- Where the hell are you?
- Construction site at Baxter.

736
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,200
He has hostages.

737
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,940
Let me go.

738
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,280
Listen!

739
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:31,680
Everybody, stand up.
They're not gonna shoot you.

740
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:34,260
Stand up in front of the windows.

741
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:36,860
They won't shoot you.
You, stay down. Stay down.

742
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,630
Fill in the blanks. Fill in the spots.

743
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:46,930
Scoot over, scoot over! That's it.

744
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:50,040
- All right, get Gruber down here.
- Okay.

745
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,210
Hey!

746
00:57:58,190 --> 00:57:59,740
All right, seal off that end.

747
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,900
- It's a busload.
- Jesus, this shit just gets deeper.

748
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:17,730
- Bobby?
- Gruber's on his way.

749
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:21,260
All right. We gotta get
our stories straight, all right?

750
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,070
We're getting our stories straight?

751
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,750
Yeah, suit up.

752
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,960
Thought we could handle this quickly
and quietly, commissioner.

753
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:47,760
A guy shoots a cop,
takes a grand-jury witness hostage...

754
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:49,600
...and we're supposed to make nice?

755
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:53,930
Commissioner, look, sir, this is...
Watch your back, sir.

756
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:55,970
This is my fault, all right?

757
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:59,480
I used to work with Mosley,
so I asked the captain to let me handle it.

758
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:03,140
I felt that I could bring him in.
I just didn't realize how far gone he was.

759
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:06,880
- Stay on Tac 2, boys.
- Wait for command, here we go.

760
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:10,060
That's it, cover them up.

761
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:16,160
Good, okay. Great job. Thank you.

762
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:26,270
- Commissioner, sir. Captain.
- Hi, Mike.

763
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,410
- What do we got?
- Cop. Twenty plus, flipped.

764
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:32,100
- Suicidal?
- Been to the farm twice the last four years.

765
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,250
- Twice?
- Twice. Nothing like this, though.

766
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:37,440
- What do you know, detective?
- Like the captain said, he flipped.

767
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:41,020
After he nailed Shue, he started
spouting crap about making headlines.

768
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:43,420
There's no way
that you're getting this guy out.

769
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,990
<i>Please fall back behind the barricades.
On the sidewalk.</i>

770
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,190
Smart cop.

771
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:54,500
Okay. You're all gonna be okay.
We're gonna get you out of here.

772
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:57,540
- Please, just move to the back of the bus.
- Jack?

773
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:00,110
Just move to the back of the bus,
please, right now.

774
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:03,180
It's okay. You're gonna get off the bus.
I am a police officer.

775
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:07,040
Jack, it's Mike Sheehan from HNT.

776
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:11,120
We worked that barricade deal
on the concourse a few years ago.

777
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:15,550
I'm gonna put this thing down, okay?

778
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,030
- I'm sorry.
- Jack!

779
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,790
I'm sorry that I got you
in this situation.

780
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:26,900
You know the drill, no weapons.

781
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,770
Listen, you're on the job.

782
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,400
- Just keep your head down.
- You know the deal.

783
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:35,100
I'm just gonna step in here,
nice and easy...

784
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:39,370
...and hand you this phone
so we can talk, okay?

785
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:44,950
Make sure we got no injuries in there.
Jack, just open the door, okay?

786
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:48,310
- I need to...
- Just throw it, Mike!

787
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:49,820
- Okay, you got it.
- Throw it!

788
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:54,220
Here you go. Jack...

789
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,790
<i>Jack, can you hear me?</i>

790
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,440
How many people you got in there, Jack?

791
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,870
Count how many people are here.

792
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:11,800
Everybody put your hands up, please.

793
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:16,410
<i>N.Y.P.D., we got a situation here.
We need you people back on the sidewalk.</i>

794
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:20,490
<i>- Stay behind the barricade.</i>
- Twenty-six, 28. Okay, thank you.

795
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:23,280
That's everybody?
Please, don't cry, don't cry.

796
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:28,720
Everything's gonna be all right, just relax.
Stay calm, okay? Thank you.

797
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,960
- What is it?
- Thirty-one. Thirty-one.

798
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:38,300
Okay, we have about
40 people on the bus.

799
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:40,830
Okay, that's good.

800
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:44,140
You know, it's important
that we're clear with each other, Jack.

801
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:47,670
<i>ESU and HNT are in place.</i>

802
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,350
The block is sealed, Jack.
It's a frozen zone.

803
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:58,390
<i>So let's work this out
so everybody can go home, all right?</i>

804
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:02,220
<i>That's all we wanna do.
Just end it, nice and easy.</i>

805
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,860
Jack?

806
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:07,900
<i>Jack? This is as far as you go, buddy.</i>

807
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,220
<i>Keep talk...</i>

808
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:30,990
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah.

809
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:33,790
- Hi, how are you?
- Good.

810
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,830
How are you?

811
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:41,200
My name's Eddie. Hi, how you doing?
Everybody's okay?

812
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:46,740
What's your name?

813
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:49,580
- Christina.
- Christina.

814
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:54,610
That's a pretty name.
How old are you, Christina?

815
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:58,720
- Seven.
- Seven years old.

816
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:04,390
And my strawberry recipe...
I know I got one. Let me see.

817
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:08,130
Where's my strawberry recipe? Let's see.

818
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:12,420
Angel-food-cake recipe right here.

819
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:16,900
Here we go, strawberry fan.

820
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,730
See right here on the top?

821
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,870
I can put a fan on the top.

822
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:26,410
You know, like a Chinese fan?

823
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:28,910
I could do that.

824
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:31,710
When's your birthday?

825
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:35,950
- September 22nd.
- Oh, so that's soon.

826
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:40,890
Gonna be 8 years old, huh?
That's gonna be a good day for you.

827
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:42,750
When's your birthday?

828
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,560
Today, actually.

829
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:50,340
- Yeah.
- Happy birthday to you.

830
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:58,130
And, yeah, every day
is somebody's birthday, you know.

831
01:03:58,310 --> 01:04:01,480
That's gonna be the motto for my shop:

832
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:03,710
"Every day's a birthday," you know.

833
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:07,820
I didn't know my birthday
was gonna turn out like this, but...

834
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:12,790
Yeah, I'm glad to be, you know,
here, alive, you know.

835
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,100
- Right here, Jack.
<i>- Yeah, Sheehan.</i>

836
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:18,930
Commissioner, sir.

837
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,900
<i>- Sheehan?</i>
- Right here.

838
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:23,590
<i>All right. This is what I want.</i>

839
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:27,000
I want you to get me
Assistant District Attorney MacDonald...

840
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:30,970
...a court stenographer
and somebody from TV.

841
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:32,940
<i>Somebody that I would recognize.</i>

842
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:35,780
<i>I want them to come on the bus
and record sworn testimony.</i>

843
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:40,180
<i>When I get what I want,</i>
I'll let everybody out. Safely.

844
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:45,190
- That's a tall order. It'll take some time...
- Just do it. I'm not in the mood, okay?

845
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,660
<i>Get these people here in 15 minutes...</i>

846
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:50,350
<i>...or I'm gonna shoot
these passengers one at a time...</i>

847
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:53,000
<i>- ... and throw them out the door.</i>
- Jack, be cool, okay?

848
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:56,140
Let's not do anything rash.
This thing can end without bloodshed.

849
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,270
- Okay? We can work this...
<i>- Fifteen minutes.</i>

850
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,130
Jack? Jack?

851
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:06,110
He's gone.

852
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:09,570
All right, everybody on your feet.

853
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:14,020
- Jack, what are you doing?
- Gotta get these people off this bus.

854
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:17,450
But you just made your call.
You called the DA. They said they'd come.

855
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:19,920
- Everybody's coming.
- Nobody's coming, okay?

856
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:21,650
What do you mean,
nobody's coming?

857
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:25,060
They're gonna breach this bus
in less than five minutes.

858
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:28,360
- They're gonna kill me, kill you...
- Jack, what about testifying?

859
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:30,830
We're right here. We can go.
We can end this.

860
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,440
- We can testify.
- Nobody's testifying.

861
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,530
It's all over, Eddie.

862
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:38,910
We lose, kid.

863
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,690
- Hey, Ray.
- Frank.

864
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:55,450
You?

865
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:58,430
You guys going in?

866
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,030
The commissioner hasn't given us
the green light yet.

867
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:07,200
Well, I don't need to remind you
that he shot two of us.

868
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,180
Enough said.

869
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:14,550
We got maybe 40 civilians on that bus.
Get them out.

870
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,810
I don't want anybody hurt,
including our guys.

871
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:20,080
Nobody's gonna get hurt, commissioner.
These guys know what to do.

872
01:06:27,290 --> 01:06:29,820
<i>- We have movement.
- Let's move in.</i>

873
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,830
<i>- Hold your fire. Repeat, hold your fire.
- Move in to the bus. Let's go.</i>

874
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,600
Hey. What...?

875
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:40,560
Bob.

876
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,640
When you get outside...

877
01:06:44,810 --> 01:06:46,680
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

878
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:49,510
They'll take you to a holding area.
It'll be hectic.

879
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,590
- But everybody's out there...
- Listen to me, listen to me.

880
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:55,310
Once you get outside that perimeter,
you just get lost.

881
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:58,480
- What if they...?
- Keep moving. You just keep moving.

882
01:06:58,660 --> 01:06:59,990
Come here. You look great.

883
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,920
Hey, gray suit.

884
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,590
Got you a gray suit.

885
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:07,960
All right? Hands in the air, folks.
Don't look back.

886
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:18,980
Hands in the air, you'll be all right.
You'll be all right.

887
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:32,720
Next. Sorry.

888
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,370
Come on, come on, let's go!

889
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:46,370
- What is he doing?
- How should I know?

890
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:48,630
- I'll let you know when I know.
- Don't you...

891
01:07:48,810 --> 01:07:51,180
I'll let you know when I know.
Out of my face!

892
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,650
Kaller, give me a hand with them!

893
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,160
Bobby? Right there. Right here.

894
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:13,390
- That's him. That's him.
- Hey, man!

895
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,630
- It's not him.
- Let him go.

896
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,860
- The dude, he changed. It's not me.
- What?

897
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,700
- He's in a suit, a gray suit.
- Suit, gray suit.

898
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:45,290
- We count 31.
- That leaves eight people on the bus.

899
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:47,130
No, I was the last one off the bus.

900
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:50,200
The only person left on that bus
is the guy with the gun.

901
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:53,100
- Then go, do it!
- Let's go, let's go.

902
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:56,510
- Get your people out there. Let's go.
- Come on, let's go.

903
01:08:57,310 --> 01:09:00,440
Mosley is still on the bus.
That kid is here somewhere. We checked...

904
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:02,410
Bobby, I don't care what you checked.

905
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:05,140
Check it again, now. Go.
You guys, that way.

906
01:09:18,970 --> 01:09:23,930
This is Detective Jack Mosley.
Shield number 227.

907
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:37,510
I guess this will be
my last will and testament.

908
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:32,570
Don't shoot!

909
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:34,340
Hold your fire!

910
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:36,310
Do not shoot! Do not shoot!

911
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,670
<i>- Who is that?</i>
- Hold your fire!

912
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,540
- Hold your fire!
<i>- Is it that wit from the 32?</i>

913
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:45,410
Get on your goddamn radio.
Find out who that is.

914
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:47,350
Guns down, hold your fire!

915
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:50,120
Don't shoot!

916
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:52,230
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

917
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:55,590
Don't shoot!

918
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,530
Don't shoot!

919
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,400
- Do not move! Step away from the bus!
- Don't shoot, hold your fire!

920
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:06,560
- Do not shoot!
- Get away from the bus!

921
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:07,870
Hold your fire.

922
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,740
Jack. Jack, it's me. Jack Mosley!

923
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:15,280
It's me, Eddie, Jack.

924
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,520
Chuck Berry.

925
01:11:19,850 --> 01:11:21,340
Chuck Berry.

926
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:25,350
Chuck Berry,
he got locked up for armed robbery.

927
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:27,790
He changed. He changed.

928
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:33,060
Barry White, he stole 300 tires.

929
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:38,370
Can you picture big Barry White
stealing 300 tires? He changed.

930
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:40,910
You said... You said people don't change.

931
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,880
- People change.
- Eddie.

932
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:46,980
- What?
- You're killing me.

933
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:50,980
Team three, breach the bus.
Repeat, team three, breach the bus.

934
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:53,620
<i>Entrance team moving in.</i>

935
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:09,230
Get out of the way!

936
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:12,670
Head down!
Cover your ears and your eyes!

937
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:19,470
- Hold fire.
- Go, go!

938
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:21,940
- Go, go, go!
- Hold your fire!

939
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,140
This is a nightmare.

940
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:41,370
Hold fire!

941
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,700
- Let's go! Move, move, move!
- Stay down!

942
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:16,340
- Move up! Move up!
- Come here.

943
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,230
<i>Team two, status?</i>

944
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:22,500
Go ahead! Take it! Go!

945
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:55,370
The bus is empty.

946
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:57,240
They went through the bus doors!

947
01:13:57,410 --> 01:14:01,040
They're in the goddamn building!
Seal it off!

948
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,580
<i>- All clear. The bus is empty.
- They've entered the building.</i>

949
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,510
Seal the building, start a search.

950
01:14:08,690 --> 01:14:11,160
Remember, heads up.
He just shot two cops. Be careful.

951
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:15,390
Jack, I gotta tell you something.

952
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:17,960
Hey, man. Jack, listen to me, man.

953
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:20,190
Jack, I wanna tell you something.

954
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:24,060
Hold on, hold on, wait.
I gotta tell you something. It's important.

955
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:27,070
Shit. Get up, go.

956
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,180
Oh, shit.

957
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:34,750
Hey, sir. I'm a cop, all right?
I'm on the job.

958
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,940
Look, I need that phone for a minute.

959
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,710
Look what you did to my suit, man.

960
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:41,880
I told you, you was gonna get me shot.

961
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:44,320
It's me. I need your help.

962
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:48,860
All this started because my friend
Maurice came by my house.

963
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:54,090
Two days ago,
Maurice came by my house.

964
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:55,670
He all excited.

965
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,430
He got a shoebox.

966
01:14:58,610 --> 01:14:59,900
He had a gun.

967
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:02,630
He talking about,
"Hold this for me for a little while."

968
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:06,580
I'm like, "I'm on parole."
He like, "Me too."

969
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:10,680
Next day, somebody shot him.

970
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:14,510
Thirty-two thousand dollars
in that shoebox.

971
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:19,350
- That's a sign, huh?
- Yeah.

972
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:21,760
It's a very big sign.

973
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:24,450
Easy, easy, easy.

974
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:32,770
You know how much it gonna take me
to open the bakery?

975
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:37,700
Thirty-one thousand dollars.

976
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:42,610
Jack, I got so nervous
I ran out the house.

977
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:47,310
I went to Port Authority
and I put the money in a locker.

978
01:15:51,390 --> 01:15:52,650
I get back to my house...

979
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:55,160
...my parole officer's there...

980
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:56,960
...in my house.

981
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:59,960
He got Maurice's gun in his hand.

982
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:03,400
He looking at me like, "That's it, Eddie."

983
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:05,640
And he's talking about 15 years, man.

984
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:08,180
I got so sick.

985
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:11,900
Then the DA came to my cell...

986
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:16,410
...and he showed me
the picture of that cop.

987
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,750
Then I met you.

988
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:25,190
Jack, they clean them lockers out
every 24 hours.

989
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:28,650
I had a little schedule going, man.

990
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:32,430
Court at 10:00...

991
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:35,730
...Port Authority at 12.

992
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:37,890
Hey. Hey, look at me. Wake up.

993
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:40,670
You ain't gonna die on me, are you?

994
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,510
I don't know, I never died before.

995
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,980
It's not gonna happen today.

996
01:16:58,060 --> 01:16:59,550
Hey. Thank you for coming.

997
01:16:59,730 --> 01:17:04,560
- What's going on?
- Look. Shot here. I think it went in and out.

998
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:06,760
Yeah, let's get him in.

999
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,440
I know you.

1000
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,470
- Come on.
- I was at your house.

1001
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,730
- You were at my apartment?
- Had to get my gun.

1002
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:16,770
Bigmouth.

1003
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:20,710
It was very nice, very clean.

1004
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:24,250
The police grilled me
for an hour at the hospital.

1005
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:25,650
What'd you say to them?

1006
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:28,220
That you're a self-medicating,
depressed individual.

1007
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:30,550
And you don't care
about anything or anyone.

1008
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:35,220
Oh, she's honest, straightforward.
That's sexy. I like that.

1009
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:46,330
What'd you do this time, Jack?

1010
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:49,270
He saved my life a couple times.

1011
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:55,450
Hey, he's a good dude.
You gotta give him another chance.

1012
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:58,550
I don't know what he did,
but you gotta give him another chance.

1013
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:01,150
He gotta have somebody to talk to.

1014
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,850
I'm not gonna be around.

1015
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:09,350
- Eddie, this is my sister, Diane.
- What?

1016
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,090
She's your sister?

1017
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:14,500
Oh, man.

1018
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:18,370
I just started having a little hope for you.
Your family don't even like you.

1019
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:21,200
I got a sister too.

1020
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,010
But she live in Seattle.

1021
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:27,610
I was supposed to go out there
and start my bakery.

1022
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:30,310
I was supposed to go out there today
to see her.

1023
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,480
See her on the bus.

1024
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:34,450
I can stop the bleeding...

1025
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:37,110
...but he's gotta get stitched up,
get to a hospital.

1026
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:39,720
We gotta be at the courthouse
in less than 20 minutes.

1027
01:18:40,230 --> 01:18:42,390
You're gonna have to do it.

1028
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:48,630
You're gonna be fine, Eddie.
It's not as bad as it looks.

1029
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:52,670
What happened to your hand?

1030
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:56,400
I gotta ask you one more favor.

1031
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:00,840
Just a little favor.

1032
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:10,020
Hey, is today really your birthday?

1033
01:19:10,190 --> 01:19:11,850
No.

1034
01:19:12,030 --> 01:19:16,620
No, I just said that because the little girl,
she was so scared.

1035
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:19,530
She was cute, man.

1036
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:22,370
When's your birthday?

1037
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:27,740
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

1038
01:19:29,710 --> 01:19:32,410
No, for real, I don't know.

1039
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:36,520
I'm not... I came up in foster care.
Had a lot of birthdays.

1040
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:41,520
But didn't you say...? You got a sister, right?
That you're going to see?

1041
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:44,680
Yeah, I just found out about her
a couple months ago.

1042
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:46,920
- Never met your sister?
- No.

1043
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:51,330
That's why I'm going out to Seattle
to meet her.

1044
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:53,730
I'm looking forward.

1045
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:56,700
Maybe she turns out
to look like Angelina Jolie.

1046
01:19:56,870 --> 01:20:00,140
Shit, if she do,
I hope she ain't my sister.

1047
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:06,810
Hey, man, what you want
on your cake, man?

1048
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:09,140
You never told me.
I gotta send you one, man.

1049
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:13,150
- I don't want no cake, Eddie.
- Damn it, Jack, come on, man...

1050
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,910
I can't think of anything
that has happened in my life...

1051
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:19,150
...that I would want written on a cake.
- Nothin'?

1052
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,230
I'm not a good guy, Eddie.

1053
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,560
I'm not a good guy.

1054
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:36,240
Yeah, me neither.

1055
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:52,090
- Diane.
- Frank.

1056
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:54,060
Give me the keys.

1057
01:20:54,230 --> 01:20:57,060
- Stay in the car.
- Little out of your sector, aren't you?

1058
01:20:57,230 --> 01:20:58,860
Saving lives knows no bounds.

1059
01:20:59,030 --> 01:21:01,520
- You should know that, Frank.
- You look good.

1060
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:03,930
You look a little desperate.
Doesn't suit you.

1061
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,570
Open the door.

1062
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:07,970
Open the door. Open the door.

1063
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:11,880
Sorry, Jack, this is as close
as I can get you.

1064
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:20,610
Like I said, you're looking good.

1065
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:26,850
Thanks, kid.

1066
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,330
All right, come on, let's go.

1067
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,960
No, hey, hold on. Hold on a minute.

1068
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:33,530
Why is that? Hold on for what?

1069
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:35,600
This is as far as you go too.

1070
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:37,900
- Come on, man. I don't...
- Listen to me, Eddie.

1071
01:21:38,070 --> 01:21:40,510
- What?
- Listen.

1072
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:44,610
Those guys you were gonna
testify against...

1073
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:46,840
...those cops?
- Yeah?

1074
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,710
I was one of them.

1075
01:21:58,190 --> 01:22:00,590
You were gonna testify against me too.

1076
01:22:03,230 --> 01:22:05,320
I did what they did.

1077
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,970
We did some bad things.

1078
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:12,330
I did another bad thing when I used you.

1079
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:17,770
I was gonna let you do
what I should have done.

1080
01:22:17,950 --> 01:22:20,970
What I should have had the courage
to do six years ago.

1081
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:27,790
I'm sorry.

1082
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:37,160
You know, if you didn't
come to get me today...

1083
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,630
...I'd be dead right now.

1084
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,600
- Right.
- So...

1085
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:46,670
I was supposed to meet you.

1086
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:49,500
That was the sign.

1087
01:22:49,910 --> 01:22:52,140
You saved my life, kid.

1088
01:22:57,050 --> 01:22:59,580
Take care of yourself, kid.

1089
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:02,720
Thank you.

1090
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:06,420
Make cakes, Eddie the baker.

1091
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:17,930
Oh, yeah. You give the car keys
to your best friend.

1092
01:23:18,110 --> 01:23:20,800
You let him take the old lady
to the hospital.

1093
01:23:20,970 --> 01:23:25,840
You stay at the bus stop with the girl
because she's the girl of your dreams, right?

1094
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:28,410
So everything's gonna be okay.

1095
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,280
- Right?
- Yeah.

1096
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:34,780
Have fun in Seattle. Say hi to your sister.

1097
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,550
Yeah.

1098
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:42,280
Yeah.

1099
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,400
Get him to the Port Authority.
Make sure he gets on that bus.

1100
01:23:46,570 --> 01:23:47,790
- Carl, thanks.
- No problem.

1101
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:49,370
All right.

1102
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:03,600
Hell of a morning, huh?

1103
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:14,950
Where's the wit?

1104
01:25:17,290 --> 01:25:18,620
You're looking at him.

1105
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,560
I let the kid go, Frank.

1106
01:25:25,930 --> 01:25:29,890
- You're not gonna get to him now.
- Bullshit.

1107
01:25:31,610 --> 01:25:32,870
Wouldn't do that.

1108
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:44,240
So...

1109
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:48,080
...what do you think
you're gonna tell them?

1110
01:25:49,390 --> 01:25:51,480
Are you gonna tell them everything?

1111
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:54,320
Are you gonna tell them about you too?

1112
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:58,060
You think that's gonna
make you feel better?

1113
01:25:58,470 --> 01:26:00,200
Nothing's gonna make me feel better.

1114
01:26:00,370 --> 01:26:02,100
Then why?

1115
01:26:03,370 --> 01:26:05,400
Look, Jack, you and me...

1116
01:26:05,570 --> 01:26:10,570
...we did our business in a certain way.

1117
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:16,310
You never complained
when we cleared the tough cases.

1118
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:20,250
It didn't bother you
doing any of that until...

1119
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:24,350
Listen to me, all right? You listen.

1120
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:27,430
Okay, Jack? Really listen.

1121
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,500
Whatever you think
that you are gonna do up there...

1122
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,200
...it is never gonna happen.

1123
01:26:34,170 --> 01:26:36,730
You are not gonna make it.

1124
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:40,810
Is that what you're thinking, Frank?

1125
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:45,510
You're gonna shoot me down here?
Nobody knows?

1126
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:49,780
Like the Ling family, huh?

1127
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:51,180
Like they never knew.

1128
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:53,950
He was a stupid old man
who wouldn't keep his mouth shut.

1129
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:56,650
All right, so I stuck a gun
in some guy's mouth.

1130
01:26:56,820 --> 01:27:00,160
- He had a heart attack, he died. So what?
- So what?

1131
01:27:00,330 --> 01:27:03,530
Look, if it hadn't happened
the way that it did, if he hadn't died...

1132
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:06,860
...you would've been patting me
on the back, saying, "Good job."

1133
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:09,760
Collateral damage,
it is a fact of life in this business.

1134
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:13,500
He took his last breaths while you were
wiping the fingerprints off the room.

1135
01:27:13,670 --> 01:27:16,610
- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was an innocent man.

1136
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:20,140
- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was somebody's husband.

1137
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:23,080
- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was somebody's father.

1138
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:26,050
He was gonna take down our case!
What were we supposed to do?

1139
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:29,550
- He wanted to tell the truth.
- Fuck the truth!

1140
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,830
Right.

1141
01:28:00,890 --> 01:28:03,580
I'm not gonna need this anymore.

1142
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:50,190
<i>Bobby? He's on his way up.</i>

1143
01:28:51,050 --> 01:28:52,040
Take him out.

1144
01:29:25,490 --> 01:29:28,290
Mosley's in the building!
Get the ADA. Freeze!

1145
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:30,390
- Hands in the air!
- Don't shoot.

1146
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,720
- Don't move! Down on your knees.
- I'm not armed.

1147
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,630
- Down on your knees! Now!
- Don't shoot, I'm not armed.

1148
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:39,430
Lower your weapon. Just call
ADA MacDonald, please, on the radio.

1149
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,930
- Hands up.
- Get ADA MacDonald here right now!

1150
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:44,400
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot me.
- Get your hands up!

1151
01:29:44,570 --> 01:29:46,340
Just get ADA MacDonald for me.

1152
01:29:46,510 --> 01:29:49,310
- Jack, come on!
- I won't argue with you. Get down.

1153
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:51,280
Mosley! Mosley!

1154
01:29:51,450 --> 01:29:52,710
Hands up!

1155
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,150
Where's my witness?
Where's Edward Bunker?

1156
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:57,620
He didn't make it.

1157
01:29:58,450 --> 01:29:59,980
I'm gonna take his place.

1158
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:08,530
- Please lower your weapons.
- Hold your fire and stand down.

1159
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:10,320
Back off.

1160
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:14,630
I have information...

1161
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,030
...regarding your ongoing
witness-tampering investigation.

1162
01:30:18,910 --> 01:30:21,670
Dates, cases that include extortion...

1163
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:25,270
...manslaughter and possible homicide...

1164
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,950
...involving members
of the 14th Precinct.

1165
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:33,510
These charges include
Captain Dan Gruber...

1166
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:36,020
...detectives Jerry Shue...

1167
01:30:36,730 --> 01:30:38,690
...Edward Maldonado...

1168
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:41,690
...Bob Torres...

1169
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:43,760
...Jim Mulvey...

1170
01:30:45,070 --> 01:30:46,730
...myself...

1171
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,530
...and Detective Frank Nugent.

1172
01:30:53,510 --> 01:30:56,240
What's this about, Mosley?
What do you want?

1173
01:30:57,010 --> 01:30:59,040
I want Edward Bunker's record expunged.

1174
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:02,480
- Done. What else?
- Nothing else.

1175
01:31:02,650 --> 01:31:04,410
You can substantiate all this, Mosley?

1176
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:07,490
Yeah.

1177
01:31:08,490 --> 01:31:09,580
Gun!

1178
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:18,360
Hold your fire. I fired that shot.

1179
01:31:24,170 --> 01:31:27,840
<i>You're gonna shoot me down here?
Nobody knows?</i>

1180
01:31:29,950 --> 01:31:31,570
<i>Like the Ling family, huh?</i>

1181
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:34,740
<i>Like they never knew.</i>

1182
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:37,510
<i>He was a stupid old man
who wouldn't keep his mouth shut.</i>

1183
01:31:37,690 --> 01:31:40,120
<i>All right, so I stuck a gun
in some guy's mouth.</i>

1184
01:31:40,290 --> 01:31:43,320
<i>- He had a heart attack, he died. So what?
- So what?</i>

1185
01:31:43,490 --> 01:31:45,590
<i>- So what?
- So how about he was innocent?</i>

1186
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:48,200
<i>- Innocent?
- How about he didn't deserve to die?</i>

1187
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:51,860
<i>Look, if it hadn't happened
the way that it did, if he hadn't died...</i>

1188
01:31:52,030 --> 01:31:54,970
<i>...you would've been patting me
on the back, saying, "Good job."</i>

1189
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:57,940
<i>Collateral damage,
it is a fact of life in this business.</i>

1190
01:31:58,110 --> 01:32:01,670
<i>He took his last breaths while you were
wiping the fingerprints off the room.</i>

1191
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:04,510
<i>- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was an innocent man.</i>

1192
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:07,910
<i>- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was somebody's husband.</i>

1193
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,850
<i>- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was somebody's father.</i>

1194
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:13,820
<i>He was gonna take down our case!
What were we supposed to do?</i>

1195
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:16,980
<i>- He wanted to tell the truth.
- Fuck the truth!</i>

1196
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:22,860
Let's get you to the jury.

1197
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:38,970
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks.

1198
01:32:39,150 --> 01:32:40,410
Okay.

1199
01:32:57,330 --> 01:32:59,700
- Hey, happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Jack.

1200
01:32:59,870 --> 01:33:01,960
Welcome back, Jack.

1201
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:04,660
- Are you kidding me?
- Two years in the pen is enough.

1202
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:06,770
Thanks for that memory. Thank you.

1203
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:08,770
- Happy birthday, Jack.
- Happy birthday.

1204
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:11,310
- Happy birthday. Blow them out.
- Welcome home.

1205
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:14,040
I hate birthdays, you know that, right?

1206
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:18,650
- Sorry, sorry.
- Happy birthday.

1207
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:30,430
This came with it.

1208
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:44,000
<i>Dear Jack Mosley,</i>

1209
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:48,780
<i>I hope you're doing well and everything
worked out like it was supposed to.</i>

1210
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:50,980
<i>I'm doing great.</i>

1211
01:33:51,150 --> 01:33:53,140
<i>Seattle is different, and I like it a lot.</i>

1212
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:57,690
<i>I'm not sure I ever smelled fresh air
before I got here. It's a trip.</i>

1213
01:33:57,860 --> 01:34:01,320
<i>Sometimes I can't believe it.
It's the best feeling I've had in my life.</i>

1214
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,900
<i>I'm busting my ass,
but I'm happy, though.</i>

1215
01:34:07,370 --> 01:34:09,860
<i>The bakery is now open. Three cheers.</i>

1216
01:34:11,670 --> 01:34:14,370
<i>I put my name first
because I'm doing all the hard work.</i>

1217
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:16,600
<i>These ovens are hot, man.</i>

1218
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:19,150
<i>Hope you like the cake.
What did I tell you?</i>

1219
01:34:19,310 --> 01:34:23,650
- That's Eddie.
<i>- If you're ever in town, you got a friend.</i>

1220
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:26,850
<i>Thank you for doing the right thing,
Jack Mosley. God bless you.</i>

1221
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:31,090
<i>Keep in touch. Peace.</i>

1222
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:33,490
- That's great.
- Go on, take one more. Look.

1223
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:38,070
You know how this guy...?
I was talking, take one more.

1224
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:41,930
<i>Happy birthday, Jack.</i>
