1
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,911
[MAN] Who's your old man, kid?
Huh? Who's your old man?

2
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,458
Who's your old man today, kid?

3
00:02:02,484 --> 00:02:05,357
Huh? Who's your old man?
[LAUGHS]

4
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,129
Who's your old man today, kid?
Huh?

5
00:02:13,339 --> 00:02:15,425
OK, champ.

6
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:20,154
We're just having a
little fun, that's all.

7
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,206
The kid's not laughing.

8
00:02:27,144 --> 00:02:30,639
You've got to quit
fighting old-timers.

9
00:02:30,665 --> 00:02:32,674
You almost killed him.

10
00:02:34,316 --> 00:02:36,402
How about taking me on?

11
00:02:36,485 --> 00:02:38,654
- For an ice-cream cone.
- Chocolate?

12
00:02:38,738 --> 00:02:41,240
- Anything you say.
- Oh, boy!

13
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:49,914
- You OK now, Dempsey?
- My name ain't Dempsey.

14
00:02:49,998 --> 00:02:52,250
What is it? Tunney? Sharkey?
Chocolate.

15
00:02:52,334 --> 00:02:55,336
- Jack Shumann.
- Shumann...

16
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:58,088
- Roger Shumann your old man?
- He's my father.

17
00:02:58,172 --> 00:03:01,008
Oh. Great flier. Real war ace.

18
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:04,761
- Shot down 14 German planes.
- 16.

19
00:03:04,844 --> 00:03:07,305
- Books say 14.
- They didn't count right.

20
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,682
- They missed two.
- All right.

21
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:12,060
I'll take your word for it.

22
00:03:13,686 --> 00:03:15,520
- How old are you?
- Nine.

23
00:03:15,604 --> 00:03:19,191
Nine, huh? Pretty big fella.
Bet you can ride a two-wheeler.

24
00:03:19,274 --> 00:03:22,235
- Two-wheeler? What's that?
- A bicycle.

25
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,155
- Can't you ride a bike yet?
- I can fly a plane.

26
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,451
That's really something.

27
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:32,115
What was that fight all about?

28
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:34,563
Didn't that grease monkey
know your old man?

29
00:03:34,622 --> 00:03:37,499
I mean your father.
Didn't he know he was Roger Shumann?

30
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:42,587
He thinks I don't know who my father is,
Roger or Jiggs.

31
00:03:44,464 --> 00:03:48,133
- Well, who's Jiggs?
- One of us.

32
00:03:48,217 --> 00:03:50,678
My father's mechanic.

33
00:04:11,863 --> 00:04:15,325
Who's that with Jack?
I hope it's not a truant officer.

34
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:18,536
No. They don't buy ice-cream cones.

35
00:04:20,663 --> 00:04:22,665
Well, look at Jiggs.

36
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:27,503
What's with you?
Gonna get in the Mardi Gras parade?

37
00:04:27,586 --> 00:04:30,588
- Can't a fella dress up?
- Sure he can.

38
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:33,591
For somebody he wants to impress.

39
00:04:35,135 --> 00:04:40,180
- You like 'em, LaVerne?
- Ooh. Brand-new. You're a dream.

40
00:04:41,807 --> 00:04:44,518
- Where'd you get 'em?
- Oh, I bought 'em downtown.

41
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:46,687
How much?

42
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,481
I saw 'em in a store window.
I... I couldn't walk away from 'em.

43
00:04:50,565 --> 00:04:53,609
- Did you rent us a room?
- [LAVERNE] We can sleep in the hangar.

44
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,988
- Have you got a nickel left for a bus ride?
- Yeah. I got $2.50 left.

45
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:58,823
Go get our money back.

46
00:04:58,906 --> 00:05:04,036
I-I-I can't, Rog. I already wrote
my name inside the boots. With ink.

47
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:08,165
Haven't you heard about the Depression?
Haven't we had enough of two-bit prizes?

48
00:05:08,248 --> 00:05:10,375
- I wasn't thinking.
- You've got to think!

49
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:13,377
It's not like it was in France,
just us and the war.

50
00:05:13,461 --> 00:05:15,518
Gotta think of
LaVerne and Jack now.

51
00:05:15,544 --> 00:05:17,990
It's over with, Roger.
Let's forget it.

52
00:05:18,049 --> 00:05:20,806
I-I saw these boots and
I had to have 'em.

53
00:05:20,832 --> 00:05:23,203
I wanted to dress
up clean for once.

54
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:26,598
Look like I was hotshot pilot, like...

55
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:30,769
like I was Roger Shumann.

56
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:33,771
Jack. Who's your friend?

57
00:05:33,854 --> 00:05:37,274
Burke Devlin. I'm with
the New Orleans Times-Picayune.

58
00:05:37,358 --> 00:05:40,194
I'm Roger Shumann.
This is my wife LaVerne.

59
00:05:40,277 --> 00:05:43,154
Jiggs, my mechanic.
Greatest grease monkey around.

60
00:05:43,237 --> 00:05:46,324
- Without him, I wouldn't fly a kite.
- Uh...

61
00:05:46,407 --> 00:05:49,452
I hope it was OK
for me to buy Jack some ice cream.

62
00:05:49,535 --> 00:05:52,330
Sure. Thanks.

63
00:05:52,413 --> 00:05:56,500
- [ROGER] How'd you meet up with the kid?
- Well, I...

64
00:05:56,583 --> 00:06:00,879
Just bumped into one another.
Got to talking, walking around.

65
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:04,590
- Anything for a story, huh?
- Yeah, just about.

66
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:09,387
Say, is there an all-night movie house
here in town?

67
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,223
No, I don't think so.

68
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:15,976
But I could fix you up
with a place to bed down for the night.

69
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:19,688
We've slept in the best hotels
and in the worst hangars, so...

70
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:22,691
- don't go feeling sorry for us.
- I have no feeling.

71
00:06:22,774 --> 00:06:26,944
Except for a story.
Maybe I'll get one out of you.

72
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,656
Make yourself at home.

73
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:36,119
Here's the key to my apartment.

74
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,544
- Hiya, Burke.
- Hello, Matt.

75
00:06:45,627 --> 00:06:49,089
How'd you tear yourself away
from LaVerne Shumann?

76
00:06:49,172 --> 00:06:51,758
- Got yourself a good pilot?
- Yeah. Crackerjack.

77
00:06:51,842 --> 00:06:54,303
This is Frank Burnham.
Burke Devlin.

78
00:06:54,386 --> 00:06:56,762
Best newspaperman in town.

79
00:06:58,973 --> 00:07:02,643
- Who's flying this one?
- White job's out. Engine's on the fritz.

80
00:07:02,727 --> 00:07:06,063
It's just as well, because I'm gonna take
all the prizes anyway.

81
00:07:06,146 --> 00:07:09,733
That's exactly what he did last week
in Oklahoma City.

82
00:07:09,816 --> 00:07:11,276
Pretty classy ships, huh?

83
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:16,989
- Yeah, not bad... for flying billboards.
- Flying billboards?

84
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:19,283
That's a hot one, ain't it?

85
00:07:19,366 --> 00:07:23,912
Hey, Burke. Look, you play ball with me,
I'll match your pay cheque.

86
00:07:23,996 --> 00:07:26,206
Something's wrong
with my typewriter.

87
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,293
Can't seem to spell out
"Diamond Blade Tractors".

88
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:32,879
[FRANK] Wow.

89
00:07:35,632 --> 00:07:38,759
- Real trim, huh?
- Shut up.

90
00:07:38,842 --> 00:07:41,762
Boy, that turned-up nose
is sure getting you down.

91
00:07:41,845 --> 00:07:44,222
Ride the plane, kid, not me.

92
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:09,912
The air show? Keep it down.
We're tight on space.

93
00:08:09,995 --> 00:08:13,374
- I'll write it, you cut it.
- I could chuck it in the waste basket.

94
00:08:13,457 --> 00:08:17,753
- You got something against war heroes?
- What war? The war between the states?

95
00:08:17,836 --> 00:08:19,463
There have been other wars.

96
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:22,632
Your war hero's
probably just a greasy, drunken Gypsy.

97
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:28,638
What do you think that air show is?
A cheap, crummy carnival of death.

98
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:35,936
Did you expect me to
spike it with cream?

99
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:38,814
No time to give you
a temperance lecture now.

100
00:08:38,897 --> 00:08:41,816
I could tell you
of winged knights jousting with death,

101
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:46,779
if I felt you could smell a story
the way you smell whisky.

102
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:57,288
- The redhead was asking about you.
- What'd you tell her?

103
00:08:57,372 --> 00:09:01,042
I told her we'd look in on her tonight
if she got a fourth for bridge.

104
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:05,004
I can't make it tonight -
and no arguments.

105
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:09,550
Well, I'll have to round up a poker game.
Is it OK if we use your flat?

106
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:10,926
No.

107
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,762
- You entertaining a maiden aunt?
- No, just some Gypsies.

108
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,973
Gypsies?

109
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,561
[BAND PLAYS LIVELY MARCH]

110
00:10:34,418 --> 00:10:36,252
- Hello.
- Hello.

111
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:39,965
- What are you reading?
- One of your books.

112
00:10:40,048 --> 00:10:41,716
Hm?

113
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,762
My Antonia by Willa Cather.

114
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,722
Nostalgia in Nebraska.

115
00:10:48,806 --> 00:10:51,392
Lost farms and faded loves.

116
00:10:51,475 --> 00:10:54,895
Brings back memories of home,
who I was.

117
00:10:56,397 --> 00:11:01,442
And how I was,
when I first started reading it...

118
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:04,737
- 12 years ago.
- Never finished it?

119
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:08,657
No, I never did.

120
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,827
I left it behind when I left home.

121
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,454
Oh. Did you run away?

122
00:11:15,914 --> 00:11:19,750
I never thought of it that way.
I had a good home.

123
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:22,712
Well, then what took you away?

124
00:11:22,795 --> 00:11:25,298
A Liberty Bond poster.

125
00:11:27,174 --> 00:11:29,718
Tacked on the front wall of our barn.

126
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:32,554
When and... where was that?

127
00:11:33,596 --> 00:11:37,684
1918... back in lowa.

128
00:11:39,018 --> 00:11:42,438
- What was on the poster?
- A painting.

129
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:46,483
A portrait of a pilot
sitting in a warplane...

130
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:49,069
Captain Roger Shumann.

131
00:11:54,324 --> 00:11:57,493
With the look of eagles in his eyes.

132
00:11:57,577 --> 00:12:00,162
You know something?
Something shameful?

133
00:12:00,245 --> 00:12:03,957
In all these years,
I've never touched another book.

134
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,918
Oh, I'd hardly take you for a bookworm.

135
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:11,589
I didn't realise till tonight
how much I missed reading.

136
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:16,510
- And where did you meet Roger?
- At an air show in my home town.

137
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:20,890
- August 17, 1920.
- And how old were you?

138
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:24,809
- 16.
- And it was love at first sight?

139
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:28,855
For me it was.

140
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:31,316
Not for Roger?

141
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:34,652
Roger, he autographed
my programme for me,

142
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:37,237
and gave me a long look.

143
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:41,533
Same kind of look I'd been used to
getting from drugstore cowboys.

144
00:12:41,617 --> 00:12:46,913
- You went away with him that night?
- He flew off alone, to Omaha.

145
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:49,874
- But you met up with him again.
- In Omaha.

146
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,501
- You followed him.
- Yes.

147
00:12:53,543 --> 00:12:57,923
With Jiggs.
I followed Jiggs to the bus station.

148
00:12:58,006 --> 00:13:01,051
When he got on the bus,
I got in the seat next to him.

149
00:13:01,134 --> 00:13:03,427
How did Jiggs take to you?

150
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,390
Like a drugstore cowboy?

151
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:11,978
No. He was smitten.

152
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,816
So smitten he was ready to splurge
on the best hotel in town.

153
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:22,487
- What did Roger say to all this?
- When Roger found me with Jiggs,

154
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,989
he swore like a sailor.

155
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:28,492
He made Jiggs feel like two cents,
me even less.

156
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:32,246
How did you change Roger's mind?
Tell him about the Liberty Bond poster?

157
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:36,749
No. I had and I still
have a romantic notion

158
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,752
that a man must tell a woman first
about his love.

159
00:13:39,836 --> 00:13:41,504
Yes. And?

160
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:48,927
I lied to Roger. I told him
I wanted to be a parachute jumper,

161
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:53,181
and if he didn't take me with him,
I'd... I'd get somebody else.

162
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,892
- And that did it?
- Yes, that and...

163
00:13:56,976 --> 00:13:59,270
a look in my eyes.

164
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:04,442
Or maybe it was the shape of my legs.

165
00:14:13,074 --> 00:14:16,202
Better let you get some sleep.

166
00:14:16,286 --> 00:14:20,122
- Why don't you take the couch?
- Where'll you go?

167
00:14:20,205 --> 00:14:22,333
I'll take the chair.

168
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,878
Thank you, very much.

169
00:14:27,128 --> 00:14:30,673
You're just like Jack.
He can sleep anywhere.

170
00:14:30,757 --> 00:14:35,303
- Bus seats, benches, anywhere.
- Does that include beds?

171
00:14:35,386 --> 00:14:40,390
No, he doesn't like beds.
They remind him of... sickness.

172
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,864
- By the way...
- Yes?

173
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:01,326
When were you and Roger married?

174
00:15:04,746 --> 00:15:07,916
It was the summer of 1923.

175
00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:10,292
July 17.

176
00:15:11,752 --> 00:15:14,797
We were in Portland, Oregon.

177
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,677
It was the night before a big show.
We were working late on our plane.

178
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:26,891
Then we went to the airport café...
for some coffee.

179
00:15:27,934 --> 00:15:29,602
What 's the matter, LaVerne?

180
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:32,896
That delayed jump this afternoon
give you the heebie-jeebies?

181
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,148
- I'm quitting.
- Hm?

182
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,569
Hey, Rog.
LaVerne says she's quitting.

183
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:45,574
What is it? You fed up? Scared?
Or are you homesick?

184
00:15:46,617 --> 00:15:49,870
No. It's just a fact of life.

185
00:15:50,912 --> 00:15:53,582
I'm in a family way.

186
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,926
If you don't marry her, I will.

187
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:09,179
- Didn't you hear me?
- I heard you.

188
00:16:09,263 --> 00:16:11,348
[JIGGS] Well...

189
00:16:11,432 --> 00:16:13,975
What do you say?

190
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:18,896
Are you just gonna sit there?
Listen, I'm talking to you.

191
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,357
Yes or no?

192
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:24,943
Quit playing the dummy.
You gonna marry LaVerne or not?

193
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:28,363
LaVerne, why don't you say something?

194
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:34,535
Eight.

195
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,704
You throw them.

196
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:43,460
Why, you dirty, no-good louse.
Step outside, I'll kick your teeth in.

197
00:16:43,543 --> 00:16:46,046
Roll the dice.

198
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:48,214
Roll the dice!

199
00:16:55,346 --> 00:16:57,431
OK, I lose.

200
00:16:57,514 --> 00:17:01,060
- I marry LaVerne.
- She gets the winner.

201
00:17:17,074 --> 00:17:19,159
We left the café.

202
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:24,915
We went to our hotel,
changed into our Sunday clothes.

203
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:31,879
And then we went looking
for a justice of the peace.

204
00:17:31,963 --> 00:17:36,925
About three in the morning,
I became Mrs Roger Shumann.

205
00:17:37,968 --> 00:17:41,012
Did you feel any shame at all?

206
00:17:43,515 --> 00:17:45,684
Yes, I felt shame.

207
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:49,103
Long before the dice game.

208
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,402
If Roger hadn't talked up,

209
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,613
would you have married Jiggs?

210
00:18:00,697 --> 00:18:02,782
No.

211
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:06,077
No.

212
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:10,998
I'd have gone off somewhere, alone.

213
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:19,422
You see... I had no reason
to marry anyone but Roger.

214
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:44,445
- What time is it?
- About two o'clock.

215
00:18:45,487 --> 00:18:47,948
Just woke out of a nightmare.

216
00:18:48,032 --> 00:18:53,036
I was going down in flames,
shot down by Baron Richthofen.

217
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,996
[LAUGHS]

218
00:18:56,581 --> 00:18:59,083
You know, I'm hungry.

219
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:02,878
- Must be strong salami.
- The stronger the better.

220
00:19:02,961 --> 00:19:06,131
Compliments of a restaurateur
with a long memory.

221
00:19:06,214 --> 00:19:09,551
- Claude Mollet.
- The power of the press, huh?

222
00:19:09,635 --> 00:19:11,802
No. Just a Frenchman,

223
00:19:11,886 --> 00:19:15,723
who never forgot that you flew for
France in the Lafayette Escadrille.

224
00:19:15,806 --> 00:19:19,060
- Vive la France.
- And that's not all.

225
00:19:19,143 --> 00:19:22,270
He's throwing a party for
all you barnstormers Mardi Gras night.

226
00:19:22,354 --> 00:19:25,565
The party's in your honour.
Everything's on the house.

227
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:30,153
That's the way it used to be in France.
Every night was Saturday night.

228
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:33,447
Every dawn was Monday morning.

229
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,450
Only the fellas who were honoured
at the parties

230
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:39,245
are those that never came back.

231
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:46,793
It's French Burgundy.

232
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,924
You can have your bed back.

233
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,345
Half of it, anyway.

234
00:20:08,771 --> 00:20:11,065
[BAND PLAYS LIVELY MARCH]

235
00:20:37,213 --> 00:20:40,341
Hey, why don't you ask me
how much I dropped last night?

236
00:20:40,425 --> 00:20:42,051
- Where'd you play?
- Willie's.

237
00:20:42,135 --> 00:20:45,846
I was filling those inside straights
when his missus blew the whistle.

238
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:48,515
On the level, what'd you do last night?

239
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:52,311
Nothing much. Just sat up half the night
discussing literature and life

240
00:20:52,394 --> 00:20:59,233
- with a beautiful, half-naked blonde.
- You'd better change bootleggers.

241
00:20:59,317 --> 00:21:02,069
Well, here I am, early,
bright and sober.

242
00:21:02,153 --> 00:21:05,947
Good. I'll put a gold star
after your next by-line.

243
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,533
My cup runneth over.

244
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:11,411
No double entendre intended.

245
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:16,457
- I'm covering the air show.
- According to my assignment book,

246
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,836
Senator Griffin, who's keen to run against
Hoover, is at the St Charles Hotel...

247
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,838
You're boring me.

248
00:21:22,922 --> 00:21:25,507
...and I've assigned
the distinguished Burke Devlin...

249
00:21:25,591 --> 00:21:27,884
The devil you have.

250
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:31,638
- Read it and weep.
- I'm covering the air show.

251
00:21:31,721 --> 00:21:35,391
For what newspaper?
The Hobo News?

252
00:21:35,475 --> 00:21:36,392
Be reasonable.

253
00:21:36,418 --> 00:21:40,087
This could be the best human-interest
yarn I ever latched on to.

254
00:21:40,145 --> 00:21:43,607
Senator Griffin is a more important story
than even the Mardi Gras.

255
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,236
Would it be if four visitors from a strange,
faraway planet were to land in the city?

256
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,531
Those flying Gypsies aren't
from another planet.

257
00:21:51,557 --> 00:21:52,932
They're from hunger.

258
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:57,203
What are you, city editor
or the humour editor?

259
00:21:57,286 --> 00:22:00,455
Something tells me
I won't be your city editor much longer.

260
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:04,876
Those flying Gypsies look like you
and me, but they're not human beings.

261
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,462
They couldn't turn those pylons
like they do,

262
00:22:07,546 --> 00:22:09,713
wouldn't dare,
if they had human brains.

263
00:22:09,797 --> 00:22:11,882
Burn them, and they don't even holler.

264
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:15,636
Scratch one,
it's not even blood they bleed.

265
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:20,223
They're a strange race of people,
without any blood in their veins at all.

266
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:24,018
- Just crankcase oil.
- Not crankcase oil.

267
00:22:24,102 --> 00:22:25,812
Alcohol.

268
00:22:25,895 --> 00:22:31,024
- Three o'clock, St Charles Hotel.
- Why, you lousy reformed drunk!

269
00:22:31,108 --> 00:22:35,445
You know what you've got in your veins?
Embalming fluid, that's what!

270
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:37,614
Embalming fluid!

271
00:22:37,698 --> 00:22:39,783
[LAUGHTER]

272
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:45,454
- Burke drunk again?
- No. Just fired up.

273
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:48,249
Correction. He's fired.

274
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:06,348
[ANNOUNCER] Ladies and gentlemen,
our special added attraction -

275
00:23:06,432 --> 00:23:09,768
a spectacular delayed parachute jump,

276
00:23:09,852 --> 00:23:15,106
featuring that beautiful distaff
daredevil, LaVerne Shumann

277
00:23:32,705 --> 00:23:34,999
And there she goes

278
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:54,683
How about that, folks?
How was that for thrills?

279
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:59,104
LaVerne Shumann executing
her daring, death-defying freefall.

280
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,308
She released her first chute,

281
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:04,550
fell in space and opened
her second chute.

282
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,361
Now she's releasing the straps

283
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:09,364
and is going to hang on to the crossbar
with her bare hands,

284
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:12,450
the first time a woman
has ever descended this way.

285
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:16,036
And can she hold on?
There's a terrific pull there.

286
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,233
Watch her, folks.

287
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:21,650
Watch her for thrills, the thrills
of excitement we promised you.

288
00:24:26,295 --> 00:24:28,172
Looks like she's going to make it.

289
00:24:28,256 --> 00:24:33,094
Yes, sir, the daring and lovely
LaVerne Shumann is going to make it.

290
00:24:37,138 --> 00:24:39,849
Give the lady a big hand, folks.

291
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:42,143
It was a tremendous feat.

292
00:24:42,227 --> 00:24:46,647
Give the lovely LaVerne Shumann
a great big hand

293
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,906
- Where's Jack?
- He went after some soda pop.

294
00:24:58,408 --> 00:25:00,743
That was quite a jump.

295
00:25:00,827 --> 00:25:05,790
The boys didn't think so. They were
hoping the wind would tear my dress off.

296
00:25:05,874 --> 00:25:09,835
- All for a lousy 20 bucks.
- It's like falling out of bed.

297
00:25:09,918 --> 00:25:12,713
Well... What if you black out?

298
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:16,407
You missed the point of our act.

299
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:19,452
I'm just the girl assistant
with the exposed legs.

300
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,929
Roger, he's the big magician.

301
00:25:22,013 --> 00:25:26,058
A little tape,
and he turns himself into a bird.

302
00:25:26,142 --> 00:25:31,938
A crazy bird, chasing after prizes
as big as... birdseed.

303
00:25:32,022 --> 00:25:34,399
You in the newspaper business
for the money?

304
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:37,152
Business?
We lovingly call it a game.

Pilots to the starting line.

[ANNOUNCER] Ladies and gentlemen,
the major event of today's programme,

307
00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:00,005
the skill dash, featuring the most
renowned speed fliers of the world today,

308
00:26:00,088 --> 00:26:04,426
including Frank Burnham
and Captain Roger Shumann.

309
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:07,012
Acting as starter
is the boss of Delta Field,

310
00:26:07,095 --> 00:26:10,306
and the sponsor of the air show,
Colonel TJ Fineman,

311
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:15,019
up and around for the first time
since his recent air crash.

312
00:26:15,102 --> 00:26:20,649
The planes are in position now,
all set for the racehorse start.

313
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,111
And there they go, down the field

314
00:26:33,911 --> 00:26:37,206
Rounding the pylon it's the favourite,
Frank Burnham, in the lead.

315
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:41,126
In second place it's Roger Shumann
in his Lafayette Escadrille biplane.

316
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,003
Trailing in third place is Speed Murphy.

317
00:26:44,087 --> 00:26:46,881
As they turn the lake pylon
and head for the field pylon,

318
00:26:46,965 --> 00:26:52,302
it's still Burnham in the lead,
Shumann second, and Murphy third.

319
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:01,311
Round the first pylon again,
Burnham sets the pace,

320
00:27:01,395 --> 00:27:04,647
Shumann's second, and Murphy third.

321
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:15,824
Around the lake pylon it's still Burnham
ahead, with Shumann closing in

322
00:27:23,373 --> 00:27:25,916
- Can Roger catch him?
- He will.

323
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,794
Even if he has to kiss the pylons.

324
00:27:30,921 --> 00:27:33,382
Here they go around the field pylon,
wing to wing.

325
00:27:33,465 --> 00:27:35,884
Looks like they're playing tag
with the pylon

326
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:40,013
- And it's Burnham with a slim lead.
- Go on, Rog! Go get him!

327
00:27:51,773 --> 00:27:55,484
It's Shumann passing Burnham
with a sensational death-defying turn

328
00:27:55,568 --> 00:27:59,572
And now Burnham must catch Shumann
as they both turn the lake pylon.

329
00:27:59,655 --> 00:28:03,201
Look at them go
It's still Shumann in the lead.

330
00:28:21,717 --> 00:28:25,095
Shumann's plane
just brushed the field pylon

331

01:15:00,165 --> 01:15:05,254
- You mean "proposition", don't you?
- Don't make a dirty word out of it.

836
01:15:05,337 --> 01:15:09,591
- Then don't make me feel naked.
- I'm sorry.

837
01:15:09,674 --> 01:15:12,551
I don't want you to
get the wrong idea.

838
01:15:12,577 --> 01:15:14,662
No sad speeches, please.

839
01:15:14,721 --> 01:15:17,348
I want to help you.

840
01:15:17,432 --> 01:15:20,434
Just give it to me in plain English.

841
01:15:23,103 --> 01:15:25,689
I'm offering you a job,

842
01:15:25,772 --> 01:15:30,026
doing your parachute stunt
for Diamond Blade.

843
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:34,739
You've got to think
of where your next meal's coming from.

844
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:38,701
- And what else do I think about?
- Kissing Jiggs goodbye.

845
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:43,079
- And?
- Letting me take care of your boy.

846
01:15:47,542 --> 01:15:50,128
- How?
- I'll put him in school.

847
01:15:52,922 --> 01:15:56,050
- A good military academy.
- Am I interrupting something?

848
01:15:56,133 --> 01:15:57,176
Yes, you are.

849
01:15:57,259 --> 01:15:58,667
Would you like that poster?

850
01:15:58,693 --> 01:16:01,038
I think I could get
Claude to part with it.

851
01:16:01,096 --> 01:16:05,808
- Don't ask him. I don't want it.
- Why? Cos it's faded?

852
01:16:05,892 --> 01:16:11,522
Look, Mr Devlin, I'm sick at heart
for ever letting my hair down with you.

853
01:16:11,606 --> 01:16:14,524
For ever saying
I wanted to walk out on Roger.

854
01:16:14,608 --> 01:16:18,487
For letting you sweet-talk me
and kiss me.

855
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:21,198
All right, so my vision was blurred.

856
01:16:21,281 --> 01:16:23,407
What do you want me to do now,
eat my words?

857
01:16:23,491 --> 01:16:25,952
No, just the cake.
Then we can get out of here.

858
01:16:26,035 --> 01:16:29,830
Who's "we"?
Who do you think you are?

859
01:16:29,914 --> 01:16:33,750
Get away from me!
Go peddle your papers!

860
01:16:42,175 --> 01:16:45,219
Farewell to you, my Antonia.

861
01:16:48,097 --> 01:16:50,182
LaVerne.

862
01:16:52,476 --> 01:16:56,563
- Where are you going?
- None of your business.

863
01:16:56,646 --> 01:17:01,734
- Where are you going?!
- Like I said, none of your business!

864
01:17:03,027 --> 01:17:04,820
[LAUGHS]

865
01:17:04,903 --> 01:17:07,406
You lose your punch, Jiggs?

866
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,285
Lose your LaVerne?

867
01:17:18,416 --> 01:17:20,501
Pardon.

868
01:17:22,795 --> 01:17:26,182
Would Madame Shumann like
to have that poster?

869
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:28,658
I could take it
out of the frame.

870
01:17:28,717 --> 01:17:32,178
[LAUGHS] Pardon me for laughing, Claude.

871
01:17:32,262 --> 01:17:36,307
But, you see, Madame Shumann's
burying the past...

872
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:40,853
with one of Matt Ord's
Diamond Blade bulldozers.

873
01:17:59,786 --> 01:18:03,040
Why did she have to go with that slob?

874
01:18:03,123 --> 01:18:06,126
I don't know. And I don't care.

875
01:18:06,210 --> 01:18:08,502
Well, I care. I...

876
01:18:10,838 --> 01:18:14,884
- I care.
- Then get on your white charger and...

877
01:18:17,845 --> 01:18:20,931
do something about it.

878
01:18:21,014 --> 01:18:23,308
What could I ever do but...

879
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,729
Iove her?

880
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:32,399
Hey, Burke? Burke!

881
01:18:33,651 --> 01:18:35,945
Where are you going?

882
01:18:39,155 --> 01:18:41,658
Where's everybody going?

883
01:18:42,283 --> 01:18:43,535
Rog.

884
01:18:44,577 --> 01:18:46,663
Rog.

885
01:18:47,956 --> 01:18:50,249
Where are you, Rog?

886
01:18:51,959 --> 01:18:54,461
Where in the hell are you?

887
01:19:08,849 --> 01:19:10,600
[LAUGHTER]

888
01:19:16,022 --> 01:19:18,525
- Well!
- Kind sir.

889
01:19:19,568 --> 01:19:25,781
Allow me to present myself.
The name, sir, is Richard Harding Davis.

890
01:19:25,865 --> 01:19:28,784
What brings you here, Mr Davis?

891
01:19:28,868 --> 01:19:31,120
Good question, sir.

892
01:19:31,203 --> 01:19:35,164
Very good.
Shows your reportorial training.

893
01:19:38,877 --> 01:19:41,754
What manner of men are these?

894
01:19:41,838 --> 01:19:44,715
Are these your so-called
gentlemen of the press,

895
01:19:44,798 --> 01:19:48,343
or are they your lavatory attendants?

896
01:19:48,427 --> 01:19:50,804
In answer to your question, sir,

897
01:19:50,888 --> 01:19:54,807
I've come to Louisiana
without a banjo on my knee.

898
01:19:54,891 --> 01:19:58,060
I've come here in
search of a story of...

899
01:20:00,646 --> 01:20:03,982
Gave it a big enough play, didn't I?

900
01:20:05,025 --> 01:20:08,987
This is a story of stories,
and what have you done with it?

901
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:10,614
Is this what you call news?

902
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:13,099
Well, do you want to
know what I call it?

903
01:20:13,158 --> 01:20:15,201
I call it the dead facts.

904
01:20:15,284 --> 01:20:19,955
The dead facts, strung together
by a deaf, dumb, blind editor!

905
01:20:20,039 --> 01:20:22,499
Me, Burke Devlin, I've got the story!

906
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:25,043
- Preserved in alcohol, no doubt.
- No.

907
01:20:25,126 --> 01:20:29,130
I've got it in my aching heart,
and you wanna know how I got it?

908
01:20:29,214 --> 01:20:34,426
By crawling through dirt and filth
and muck and smut!

909
01:20:34,509 --> 01:20:37,930
By finding truth and beauty
where you'd never expect to find it.

910
01:20:38,013 --> 01:20:40,682
Do you know who's lying dead
at the bottom of a lake?

911
01:20:40,766 --> 01:20:42,768
The son of an Ohio country doctor,

912
01:20:42,851 --> 01:20:45,728
a child who refused
to follow in his father's footsteps

913
01:20:45,811 --> 01:20:48,814
because he was also
a child of the 20th century.

914
01:20:48,898 --> 01:20:51,526
He was a boy who stole under
the tent of a faraway war

915
01:20:51,609 --> 01:20:54,362
because he had outgrown
the motorbikes and motor cars,

916
01:20:54,445 --> 01:20:58,990
and because he had a hunger
for the flying machine.

917
01:20:59,074 --> 01:21:02,661
He knew no flags
and no enemy but one - death.

918
01:21:02,744 --> 01:21:05,455
When the war ended
he found himself a reluctant hero.

919
01:21:05,539 --> 01:21:07,915
He hadn't asked
for the confetti and flags...

920
01:21:07,998 --> 01:21:10,417
- [PHONE RINGS]
...and he ran from them.

921
01:21:10,501 --> 01:21:12,711
The hell with that. You listen to this.

922
01:21:12,795 --> 01:21:17,465
He was lost until he found those pylons,
those three bony fingers of death

923
01:21:17,549 --> 01:21:20,510
sticking out of the earth,
waiting to bring him down.

924
01:21:20,593 --> 01:21:23,304
And he chased those pylons
from coast to coast,

925
01:21:23,388 --> 01:21:25,640
Canada in the summer,
Mexico in the winter,

926
01:21:25,723 --> 01:21:29,476
the four of them living out of
one suitcase and one can opener.

927
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,145
And it wasn't money he was after
any more than glory,

928
01:21:32,229 --> 01:21:35,190
because the glory only lasted
until the next race.

929
01:21:35,274 --> 01:21:38,442
He was a man
conquered by the flying machine.

930
01:21:38,526 --> 01:21:42,154
And that isn't all.
He forsook all earthbound vanities -

931
01:21:42,238 --> 01:21:45,157
home, family and love. Why?

932
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:50,203
Because deep down he knew
that a man without blood in his veins

933
01:21:50,287 --> 01:21:53,790
has go to fall down, sooner or later.

934
01:21:54,833 --> 01:21:57,544
And Roger Shumann fell down.

935
01:21:58,961 --> 01:22:03,257
The night before he fell into the lake,
he fell so far and so hard

936
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:06,135
for the sake of the flying machine,

937
01:22:06,218 --> 01:22:10,221
that the crankcase oil
burst from his veins

938
01:22:10,305 --> 01:22:13,516
and a heart heavy with shame

939
01:22:14,559 --> 01:22:17,061
pumped blood back into them.

940
01:22:19,272 --> 01:22:24,693
Turning the last pylon, he was something
he thought he'd never be again -

941
01:22:24,776 --> 01:22:27,029
a human being.

942
01:22:27,112 --> 01:22:31,324
And he died only because he was thinking
of the human beings he might kill

943
01:22:31,407 --> 01:22:34,327
if he tried to land on the field.

944
01:22:34,410 --> 01:22:40,540
For among them was a woman and a boy
whose love he had finally accepted,

945
01:22:40,624 --> 01:22:47,130
a wife and son... for whom he was
gonna forsake his flying machine that...

946
01:22:47,214 --> 01:22:50,175
in the end forsook him.

947
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:54,428
He died the death of a hero,

948
01:22:54,512 --> 01:22:57,014
and he deserves our tears.

949
01:22:58,015 --> 01:23:01,434
So throw the dirt gently into his grave.

950
01:23:03,102 --> 01:23:05,396
Take off your hat.

951
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:08,066
Bow your head...

952
01:23:09,108 --> 01:23:11,611
and read kindly his epitaph.

953
01:23:15,364 --> 01:23:17,866
"Here lies Roger Shumann...

954
01:23:19,368 --> 01:23:23,079
brother of the unknown ancient man,

955
01:23:23,162 --> 01:23:28,167
who first climbed onto a horse
and spanned the horizons."

01:23:34,422 --> 01:23:36,925
I'm sorry. Real sorry.

Tomorrow?

960
01:23:46,684 --> 01:23:49,728
I'll probably be drunk.

961
01:23:49,812 --> 01:23:53,315
Make it the day after tomorrow.

962
01:23:53,399 --> 01:23:56,526
What happens now? With the girl?

963
01:23:57,569 --> 01:24:01,739
She covers herself with dirt.
Matt Ord's dirt.

964
01:24:04,117 --> 01:24:07,953
I think you're in love
with more than a story.

965
01:24:10,956 --> 01:24:13,041
Yeah.

What do you want now?

968
01:24:37,479 --> 01:24:39,273
This'll do for a start.

969
01:24:42,651 --> 01:24:44,904
And how are you?

970
01:24:45,946 --> 01:24:48,448
I said, what do you want now?

971
01:24:48,531 --> 01:24:52,785
A mere 100 bucks.
Or has our bet slipped your mind?

972
01:25:12,762 --> 01:25:17,517
- Good night.
- Man, where's your Dixie hospitality?

973
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,602
I haven't finished my drink yet.

974
01:25:22,187 --> 01:25:26,691
And besides, I feel obliged to pass along
a couple of great publicity stunts

975
01:25:26,775 --> 01:25:29,902
that have been distilling
in my remarkable brain.

976
01:25:29,985 --> 01:25:32,238
- Some other time.
- It won't keep.

977
01:25:32,321 --> 01:25:35,324
It's too hot, too sensational.

978
01:25:35,407 --> 01:25:37,701

"Diamond Blade Two" on the other.

- Where?

01:26:25,202 --> 01:26:27,413

01:26:27,496 --> 01:26:30,749
I hate airports. Too many airplanes.

- Planes, trains and buses to lowa.

- What's in lowa?
- Black loam, yellow harvests,

and barns plastered
with faded Liberty Bond posters.

someplace else.

01:27:28,092 --> 01:27:31,095
- Are you doing it for Jack?
- I'm doing it for myself.

1005
01:27:31,179 --> 01:27:34,140
- You're lying.
- All right! I am doing it for Jack!

1006
01:27:34,224 --> 01:27:37,017
I'll be putting the boy
through school.

1007
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:39,895
Jack'll grow to hate you for it.

1008
01:27:39,978 --> 01:27:43,941
And he'll hate himself.
Don't do this to him.

1009
01:27:44,024 --> 01:27:47,693
He's taken enough of the whispers
the smirks, the dirty laughs,

1010
01:27:47,777 --> 01:27:51,739
and the grease monkeys taunting him
with "Who's your old man today?"

1011
01:27:51,823 --> 01:27:54,325
- Oh, no!
- I saw it happen.

1012
01:27:55,992 --> 01:27:58,370
He never said a word.

1013
01:27:58,453 --> 01:28:01,998
- Not a word.
- Do you expect him to?

1014
01:28:03,416 --> 01:28:07,127
You won't be able to bury your dreams
at the bottom of the lake.

1015
01:28:07,211 --> 01:28:13,467
You'll have to go on asking yourself
"What's your dream, LaVerne?"

1016
01:28:13,551 --> 01:28:16,053
"What's your dream today?"

1017
01:28:48,248 --> 01:28:50,333
[DOOR CLOSES]

1018
01:29:01,010 --> 01:29:03,512
Goodbye, Mr Devlin.

1019
01:29:03,596 --> 01:29:05,681
Goodbye, Jack.

1020
01:29:09,017 --> 01:29:11,603
Goodbye. And thanks.

1021
01:29:12,812 --> 01:29:16,858
- Will I ever see you again?
- I don't know.

1022
01:29:24,448 --> 01:29:27,367
I want it returned, personally.
