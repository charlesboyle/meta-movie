¶

2
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:28,135
( sirens blaring )

3
00:00:41,349 --> 00:00:43,316
( Indistinct chattering )

4
00:00:43,718 --> 00:00:45,452
( Sobbing )

5
00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:54,461
( Woman speaking
indistinctly over p.A. )

6
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:56,930
We have an 18-year-old male

7
00:00:56,932 --> 00:01:00,433
with gunshot wounds
to the leg and shoulder.

8
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,569
One, two, three.

9
00:01:09,744 --> 00:01:11,945
Yep. He's on something.

10
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:15,749
Jason. I need to talk to Jason.

11
00:01:16,217 --> 00:01:19,786
Soon. Just not now.

12
00:01:21,822 --> 00:01:23,790
Get her into pre-op.

13
00:01:27,895 --> 00:01:29,896
How did you get in?

14
00:01:29,898 --> 00:01:31,598
I...I heard the gunshots,

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,634
and I rushed to the back door.

16
00:01:35,536 --> 00:01:37,537
( Sniffling )

17
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:39,940
What'd you do to Jason?

18
00:01:39,942 --> 00:01:41,408
Huh?

19
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,809
Can I see a doctor?

20
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,678
Baby, the police are outside.

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,480
And if you're up to it,
they want to talk to you.

22
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,949
I'll take care of Ashley,
Mr. Lane.

23
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:50,684
Thank you, brother.

24
00:02:00,861 --> 00:02:02,896
( Machine beeps )

25
00:02:03,664 --> 00:02:05,398
So...

26
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,467
How did you end up

27
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,737
at your brother's girlfriend's
house last night?

28
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,239
We were working on...

29
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:13,740
Christmas costumes for my play.

30
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:17,244
Where'd you get the money
we found in your possession?

31
00:02:17,246 --> 00:02:19,346
We were raising that money

32
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,580
at the garage sale yesterday.

33
00:02:20,582 --> 00:02:25,552
See, this past fall,
things had gotten pretty bad...

34
00:02:25,554 --> 00:02:27,754
At school,

35
00:02:27,756 --> 00:02:29,589
at home.

36
00:02:29,724 --> 00:02:31,925
Man: This year's production,

37
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:34,661
<i>holiday cheer,</i> has been penned

38
00:02:34,663 --> 00:02:36,930
by yours truly.

39
00:02:36,932 --> 00:02:39,866
( Scattered applause )

40
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:41,835
All right,
so when I call your name,

41
00:02:41,837 --> 00:02:44,704
just come up to the stage
and state the part

42
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,773
you'll be reading.

43
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:49,909
Uh, Monica tishauer.

44
00:02:56,317 --> 00:02:58,918
( Clears throat )
I'll be reading for Betty,

45
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,053
the garbage girl.

46
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:04,891
Just look at what
I found in my garbage truck.

47
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,327
I'll have the best-decorated

48
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:09,663
house in town.

49
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:12,999
( Snickering )

50
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:14,968
This is garbage.

51
00:03:15,303 --> 00:03:18,505
( Sighs ) Man: Ashley Lane?

52
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,642
Ashley Lane?

53
00:03:23,644 --> 00:03:26,746
People, time is of the essence.

54
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,784
Last call for Ashley Lane.

55
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:35,722
Right.

56
00:03:36,324 --> 00:03:38,725
Karen snow?

57
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:48,435
( Sighs )

58
00:03:54,809 --> 00:03:56,743
( Sighs )

59
00:03:57,878 --> 00:03:59,045
Idiot.

60
00:03:59,047 --> 00:03:59,879
How will you know

61
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:01,081
if you will ever do anything

62
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,717
if you can never do anything?

63
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:06,386
( Sighs )

64
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:08,655
( Gasps )

65
00:04:09,657 --> 00:04:11,758
How'd it go?

66
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,959
It went.

67
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,863
I decided that
I didn't have time. So...

68
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:18,064
Should at least try.

69
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:19,899
Yeah? You didn't.

70
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:21,601
It's gonna be stupid anyway.

71
00:04:21,603 --> 00:04:23,470
( Affecting accent )
Oh, but Ms. Lane,

72
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,772
you'd be missing out
on such a wonderful

73
00:04:25,774 --> 00:04:27,674
high school experience.

74
00:04:27,676 --> 00:04:30,577
Nicki, drop dead.

75
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:32,879
( Sighs )

76
00:04:35,516 --> 00:04:36,649
¶ Listen closely

77
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:41,121
¶ or you'll never
hear me whisper ¶

78
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:42,956
¶ all the pretty things.

79
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:47,460
¶ I'm scared to say out loud ¶

80
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:48,828
¶ in my mind I know

81
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,499
¶ all I can do is kiss you
( Dog barking )

82
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:59,105
¶ But I'm caught between the
curtain and the crowd ¶

83
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,875
forgot to pick up Jason. Ah.

84
00:05:01,877 --> 00:05:04,444
He's been waiting a half an hour.
( Sighs )

85
00:05:04,446 --> 00:05:08,681
Well, he's 17.
He'll get over it.

86
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:12,752
Would it bother you so much
if it was Ashley I forgot?

87
00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:14,421
Forget about it. I'm going.

88
00:05:14,423 --> 00:05:15,555
I'm going.

89
00:05:15,557 --> 00:05:17,690
Thank you, bill.

90
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:19,826
( Sighs )

91
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:24,998
How about let's just have an
early dinner tonight, huh, baby?

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,065
Uh, tonight's no good.

93
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:29,836
I already made plans
with Phyllis and Claire.

94
00:05:29,838 --> 00:05:31,638
Maybe next time.

95
00:05:32,907 --> 00:05:35,208
Okey-dokey.

96
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:53,560
I know...

97
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,696
( Music playing indistinctly )

98
00:05:57,031 --> 00:05:58,064
Drive you home?

99
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,000
No, it's okay, Mr. Lane.
I gotta meet someone.

100
00:06:01,002 --> 00:06:04,204
But, uh, catch y'all later.

101
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,180
( Sniffing )

102
00:06:14,182 --> 00:06:15,715
Fasten your seatbelt.

103
00:06:15,717 --> 00:06:19,652
It wasn't me. It was Nicki.
Mm-hmm.

104
00:06:20,955 --> 00:06:23,723
( Seatbelt clicks )

105
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:25,158
( Music stops )

106
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:28,027
( Sighs )

107
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:30,129
I think your mother...

108
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:32,699
you mean your wife? ( Sighs )

109
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:36,736
You've got to stop
hanging out with Nicole.

110
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,610
When we get home,

111
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,646
I want you to put those
clothes in the laundry.

112
00:06:46,648 --> 00:06:48,815
They smell like smoke.

113
00:06:50,184 --> 00:06:52,519
I saw that.

114
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,971
( Jason coughing ) Geez!

115
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,306
Who reeks in here?

116
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,943
This must be you,
ashtray Lane, right?

117
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:18,845
( No audible dialogue )

118
00:07:18,847 --> 00:07:21,648
So Jason, how was practice?

119
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,917
( Sighs ) Brutal.

120
00:07:24,084 --> 00:07:25,718
Captain hit the hurdle full-on.

121
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,554
He's probably
out for the season.

122
00:07:27,556 --> 00:07:31,591
But hopefully I get my shot
at being captain now.

123
00:07:31,593 --> 00:07:33,259
Really?

124
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:35,261
It could happen. Right?

125
00:07:35,263 --> 00:07:37,864
I mean, who else
would coach pick, anyway?

126
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:41,968
Someone with better grades.

127
00:07:42,937 --> 00:07:46,606
¶ Father, lay your hand
upon my head ¶

128
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:51,611
¶ I said it's
only consolation ¶

129
00:07:54,214 --> 00:07:57,216
¶ although we
have the same disease ¶

130
00:07:57,218 --> 00:08:02,689
¶ I'm afraid we may
need different medication ¶

131
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:04,090
where's mom?

132
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:06,059
At some committee thing.

133
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:06,726
Right.

134
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:08,294
Yo. Think fast, brainless.

135
00:08:08,296 --> 00:08:09,762
( Laughs ) ( Groans )

136
00:08:09,764 --> 00:08:12,365
¶ Sit down

137
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,366
¶ and...

138
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,635
Hey, where you going?

139
00:08:15,637 --> 00:08:16,069
Uh...

140
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:19,772
Just gonna go meet up
and study with angel tonight.

141
00:08:19,774 --> 00:08:20,907
Look, uh...

142
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:22,909
If I don't get off probation
this semester,

143
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:23,843
then I can't run track.

144
00:08:23,845 --> 00:08:27,680
And we both know how disappointed
that would make mom, right?

145
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:29,282
( Whispers ) Yeah. Sorry.

146
00:08:29,284 --> 00:08:31,384
Where're your books?

147
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,920
¶ So relax

148
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:37,390
¶ sit down

149
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,258
¶ and talk to...

150
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,929
I'm gonna go get some chicken.

151
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:46,132
Anybody...

152
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:48,134
Wanna come?

153
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:50,737
Nicki, big surprise...

154
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,838
Sharon is out. ( Sighs )

155
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,207
And all I have to do
is homework and laundry.

156
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:55,708
Dad's picking up dinner.

157
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,710
So you're alone?

158
00:08:57,712 --> 00:08:59,178
Cain's club time.

159
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,279
Uh, I don't...

160
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:02,749
( scoffs ) He's gonna be back.

161
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:03,316
So?

162
00:09:03,318 --> 00:09:05,385
Just leave him a note.

163
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:08,921
Okay, meet me in 15.

164
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:14,827
( Exhales deeply )

165
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:17,864
( Motorcycle engine idling )

166
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:39,352
Hey, there.

167
00:09:39,354 --> 00:09:40,386
Hey.

168
00:09:40,388 --> 00:09:41,888
What's your name?

169
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,223
They all go off and leave you?

170
00:09:44,225 --> 00:09:45,058
Willy, huh?

171
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,993
( Making clicking noises )

172
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:51,130
Thank you very much.

173
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,900
We just met.

174
00:09:57,871 --> 00:09:59,872
Wanna come out and play?

175
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:01,240
Huh?

176
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:02,975
Come on.

177
00:10:11,885 --> 00:10:13,119
( Whistling )

178
00:10:13,121 --> 00:10:13,853
Billy.

179
00:10:13,855 --> 00:10:16,122
( Whistling ) Come on.

180
00:10:23,263 --> 00:10:25,498
( Sniffs ) You...

181
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,900
You really stink.

182
00:10:27,902 --> 00:10:30,236
We have to work on that.

183
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:35,942
( Groans )

184
00:10:36,376 --> 00:10:37,777
( Groans )

185
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:39,445
Nice.

186
00:10:40,414 --> 00:10:42,248
( Grunts )

187
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,184
I've got to go.

188
00:10:45,753 --> 00:10:47,854
But I'll be back.

189
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:51,157
See you later.

190
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:52,792
( Dance music playing )

191
00:10:52,794 --> 00:10:54,927
So this beats
doing laundry, huh?

192
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:57,130
I mean, just a little?

193
00:10:57,264 --> 00:11:00,233
I can't find my cigarettes.

194
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:05,104
You and your dad
not so Disney these days.

195
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:06,172
Sharon and me...

196
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:09,809
Like a total train wreck.

197
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,078
( Clatters )

198
00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:15,915
You got a light?

199
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:19,786
Man: Have we met before?

200
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:23,823
Trust me...
If we had, you'd remember.

201
00:11:23,825 --> 00:11:25,191
Dance?

202
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:54,453
Boy: Hey, Jason!

203
00:11:54,455 --> 00:11:57,023
( Laughing and chattering )

204
00:12:10,337 --> 00:12:11,470
First-timers.

205
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:13,906
Hey. Keep it down.

206
00:12:13,908 --> 00:12:14,874
( Chuckling )

207
00:12:14,876 --> 00:12:17,210
( Lilting voice ) I got money.

208
00:12:17,212 --> 00:12:18,244
( Chuckles ) Um...

209
00:12:18,246 --> 00:12:20,446
I was just going
down to angel's.

210
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,148
You could drop me off there.

211
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,084
( Singsong voice ) I am...

212
00:12:25,086 --> 00:12:27,320
Superman.

213
00:12:27,322 --> 00:12:28,988
I can do anything.

214
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,923
Man, you... you blew me away

215
00:12:30,925 --> 00:12:32,325
at practice today.

216
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:33,459
You think maybe, uh...

217
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,995
You could teach me
to do distance?

218
00:12:35,997 --> 00:12:36,629
( Laughing )

219
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:40,433
I'm not a miracle worker, baby.

220
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:41,367
( Sighs )

221
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:42,635
Just superman.

222
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,303
Go ahead, jazz.

223
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,938
I'll advance you...

224
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,340
Again.

225
00:12:49,343 --> 00:12:51,577
Hey, hey, hey. ( Laughs )

226
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:53,880
That's... that's mine.

227
00:12:53,882 --> 00:12:56,115
Rich boy's good for it.

228
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,552
Nobody gets deep into me.

229
00:13:11,098 --> 00:13:12,932
( Grunts )

230
00:13:12,934 --> 00:13:15,401
( Sighs ) I still owe you?

231
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:19,505
You jocks aren't very good
with numbers, are you?

232
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,406
$120.

233
00:13:20,408 --> 00:13:23,042
What?! I-I just
gave you a hundred.

234
00:13:23,044 --> 00:13:25,411
You haven't give me Jack.

235
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:29,048
Your parties are never
gonna be on me.

236
00:13:29,283 --> 00:13:31,117
I'll get it to you, g.

237
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:32,919
Tomorrow, jazz.

238
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:34,553
And forget about angel.

239
00:13:34,555 --> 00:13:37,189
She doesn't own you.

240
00:13:50,604 --> 00:13:52,204
( Grunts )

241
00:13:54,675 --> 00:13:56,542
Hello?

242
00:14:02,683 --> 00:14:05,351
( Slurring speech )
Wait a minute.

243
00:14:05,353 --> 00:14:07,687
( Laughs )

244
00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:09,055
This isn't...

245
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,991
this isn't the washroom.

246
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,696
( Groans )

247
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,734
Hello?

248
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:27,573
You know, this isn't exactly the best
neighborhood to be passing out in.

249
00:14:28,642 --> 00:14:30,343
Where's your date?

250
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:35,014
( Slurring speech )
I'm not allowed to date.

251
00:14:35,016 --> 00:14:39,185
I am a princess. ( Chuckling )

252
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,420
Shh.

253
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,322
Shh.

254
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:46,359
( Laughing )

255
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:48,260
Oh...

256
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,762
( Whimpers )

257
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,775
All right, let's get you home.

258
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,544
( Laughing )

259
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:12,284
( Laughing ) ( Grunts )

260
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:18,691
What... Great... Hair.

261
00:15:18,693 --> 00:15:20,793
( Laughing )

262
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,368
( Sighs )

263
00:15:33,173 --> 00:15:34,707
Whoo.

264
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:38,044
Yay.

265
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,519
( Sighs )

266
00:15:46,521 --> 00:15:50,823
Well, princess,
where do you live?

267
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:53,626
At home.

268
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,366
( Slurring speech )
Would you like to kiss me?

269
00:16:00,368 --> 00:16:03,836
Definitely not. ( Grunts )

270
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,105
Why not?

271
00:16:06,107 --> 00:16:07,573
Am I ugly?

272
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:08,741
( Gasps ) No.

273
00:16:08,743 --> 00:16:11,410
Your breath stinks.

274
00:16:11,412 --> 00:16:13,312
I like you, too.

275
00:16:13,314 --> 00:16:15,247
Look, I've got to be at work
early tomorrow,

276
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:19,118
and if you want a ride home,
just tell me where you live.

277
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,821
Otherwise, out of the van.

278
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:27,660
( Singsong voice ) 5...3...3...

279
00:16:27,662 --> 00:16:31,130
Parkwood drive.

280
00:16:32,432 --> 00:16:34,300
You know...

281
00:16:34,302 --> 00:16:37,103
You're not very nice.

282
00:16:37,105 --> 00:16:38,737
I am <i>not</i>

283
00:16:38,739 --> 00:16:42,174
going to dance with you.

284
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:45,377
Hey, baby.

285
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,378
Sharon: Hey.

286
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,746
How was dinner?

287
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:50,683
Didn't go too well.

288
00:16:53,553 --> 00:16:54,353
I missed you.

289
00:16:54,355 --> 00:16:55,788
Did you have a good time?

290
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,489
( Sighs )

291
00:16:56,491 --> 00:16:58,591
We were trying to motivate
the denby company

292
00:16:58,593 --> 00:17:01,861
to conform to green standards.
Mm-hmm.

293
00:17:01,863 --> 00:17:04,497
I have been working,

294
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:06,332
and I am tired.

295
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:07,666
I'm green.

296
00:17:07,668 --> 00:17:09,502
Did you feed that dog?

297
00:17:09,504 --> 00:17:11,270
Ah...

298
00:17:11,272 --> 00:17:12,471
I told Jason to do it.

299
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:14,540
The dog is not Jason's
little brother.

300
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:16,509
And it's not gonna make up
for the fact

301
00:17:16,511 --> 00:17:19,678
that we don't
have a child together.

302
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:22,848
Wow.

303
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,518
( Sighs )

304
00:17:30,757 --> 00:17:32,558
( Sighs )

305
00:17:33,693 --> 00:17:35,361
What are you doing?

306
00:17:35,363 --> 00:17:36,562
( Laughing )

307
00:17:36,564 --> 00:17:37,463
( Breathing heavily )

308
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:40,499
Bill: I thought you were
in your room not feeling well.

309
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:41,267
I am not.

310
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,668
Sharon: Where have you been?

311
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,702
And what are you wearing?!

312
00:17:43,704 --> 00:17:46,305
( Slurring speech )
That's too many questions.

313
00:17:46,307 --> 00:17:49,542
I only do one at a time, okay?

314
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:51,510
It is not okay.

315
00:17:51,512 --> 00:17:53,379
Are you drunk?

316
00:17:53,381 --> 00:17:53,946
You been drinking?

317
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,247
Oh, give it a rest, Sharon.

318
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:56,615
I seem to remember you
getting hammered

319
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,584
a time or two
when you were younger.

320
00:17:58,586 --> 00:18:00,886
Bill: Come here, baby.

321
00:18:00,888 --> 00:18:01,754
Okay, daddy.

322
00:18:01,756 --> 00:18:03,189
Put your hand around daddy.

323
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:04,557
Oh... Real neat.

324
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,225
I love you. I know.

325
00:18:06,227 --> 00:18:09,862
( Groans ) Can I have
some cookies and milk?

326
00:18:12,432 --> 00:18:15,935
You know you're
better than this.

327
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:20,573
I wish I had a real mom.

328
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,743
<i>( Thunder crashing )</i>

329
00:18:27,714 --> 00:18:31,483
( Indistinct chattering
over police radio )

330
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:42,628
You remind me so much
of Amanda.

331
00:18:43,263 --> 00:18:45,998
My little princess.

332
00:18:49,502 --> 00:18:51,370
Sharon hates me.

333
00:18:51,372 --> 00:18:54,306
Oh, no she doesn't.

334
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:56,976
She does not hate you.

335
00:18:56,978 --> 00:18:58,344
She just gets disappointed

336
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,747
when you do things
like tonight.

337
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,784
I'm disappointed, too.

338
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,288
( Whispers )
But I still love you.

339
00:19:14,394 --> 00:19:17,363
Good night, princess.

340
00:19:18,498 --> 00:19:22,668
Why do you
disappoint Sharon, daddy?

341
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:29,842
( Breathes deeply )

342
00:20:10,684 --> 00:20:13,052
( Sighs )

343
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:14,653
Whoa. ( Coughs )

344
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:17,856
Who beat you up last night?
( Sighs )

345
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:21,527
( Sighs ) You look like trash.

346
00:20:23,463 --> 00:20:24,330
No response?

347
00:20:24,332 --> 00:20:27,599
Okay. Cool. ( Sniffles )

348
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:31,737
Oh, yeah. Here you go.

349
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:33,639
Want some breakfast?

350
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,607
You can have as much
as you want.

351
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,509
I made enough for everybody.

352
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:40,546
( Retching ) What?

353
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,415
( Retching continues )

354
00:20:46,553 --> 00:20:47,953
Okay.

355
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,521
More for me.

356
00:20:49,523 --> 00:20:51,457
( Sniffles )

357
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,126
( Sniffles )

358
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,768
I actually feel better.

359
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,802
I bet you do.

360
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,038
( Chuckles )
Just wanna die now.

361
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,007
Well, here's a little
trick I learned.

362
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:10,409
( Sniffles )

363
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:11,110
( Coughs )

364
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:12,111
Peppermint schnapps.

365
00:21:12,113 --> 00:21:14,079
( Sighs ) Drink some of this.

366
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:16,782
You'll feel better. Come on.

367
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:19,651
( Sniffles )

368
00:21:21,654 --> 00:21:23,722
Ooh. Oh, that's good.

( Breathing deeply )

371
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:30,629
I owe you.

372
00:21:30,631 --> 00:21:32,731
Ah, actually,

373
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:35,401
funny that you say that.

374
00:21:35,403 --> 00:21:36,068
I, uh...

375
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,470
Could use some money right now.

376
00:21:38,472 --> 00:21:40,005
Hmm. Hmm.

377
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:43,575
You and everybody else.

378
00:21:46,045 --> 00:21:47,079
Y... what?

379
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:48,814
What am I supposed
to do with $5?

380
00:21:48,816 --> 00:21:52,117
I can't... Sharon: Good morning.

381
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:52,718
Jay,

382
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,919
haven't seen you in a while.

383
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:55,554
What's been keeping <i>you</i> busy?

384
00:21:55,556 --> 00:21:57,656
That was your fault
last night, mom.

385
00:21:57,658 --> 00:21:59,057
What are you talking about?

386
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:01,527
While you were at your
meeting thing,

387
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:04,129
I was hittin' the books.

388
00:22:05,165 --> 00:22:06,865
All right, um,

389
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,800
I happen to be free tonight

390
00:22:07,802 --> 00:22:09,668
if you wanna go grab dinner
or something,

391
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,769
just the two of us. You're on.

392
00:22:10,771 --> 00:22:13,705
I'll pick you up after practice.
All right.

393
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,840
Bye, baby.

394
00:22:14,842 --> 00:22:17,042
( Whispers ) Feel better.

395
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,090
Sharon.

396
00:22:33,526 --> 00:22:35,761
About last night...

397
00:22:35,763 --> 00:22:36,962
I'm sorry.

398
00:22:36,964 --> 00:22:37,796
I guess I just...

399
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:40,766
Makin' a play
for your father's attention?

400
00:22:40,768 --> 00:22:42,568
Again?

401
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:43,902
I'm just trying to...

402
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,871
well I'm trying to keep peace

403
00:22:45,873 --> 00:22:46,939
for your father's sake.

404
00:22:46,941 --> 00:22:49,074
Can't you at least do that?

405
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,944
Keep peace? Mm-hmm.

406
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:54,079
Yeah.

407
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,881
Yeah, I can... I can do that.

408
00:22:55,883 --> 00:22:58,617
Good. ( Phone ringing )

409
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:04,723
( Sighs )

410
00:23:14,901 --> 00:23:16,902
"Good morning, dad."

411
00:23:16,904 --> 00:23:18,136
Hello, kids.

412
00:23:18,138 --> 00:23:20,005
( Clears throat )

413
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:21,673
( Sighs )

414
00:23:21,841 --> 00:23:23,976
"I'll make you coffee, dad."

415
00:23:23,978 --> 00:23:25,878
Thank you, honey.

416
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,251
"I'll do the dishes, dad."

417
00:23:32,253 --> 00:23:34,586
Thank you, Jason.

418
00:23:36,756 --> 00:23:39,258
( Groans )

419
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,995
Make it strong, bill.

420
00:23:42,997 --> 00:23:45,230
Make it strong.

421
00:23:45,232 --> 00:23:46,999
( Mutters )

422
00:23:59,546 --> 00:24:01,813
What is that?

423
00:24:02,081 --> 00:24:04,049
Here you go. Thank you, baby.

424
00:24:04,051 --> 00:24:05,083
You're welcome.

425
00:24:05,085 --> 00:24:06,051
Sharon? Yeah.

426
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:09,021
Could we agree
to cut down on some things?

427
00:24:09,023 --> 00:24:10,222
I'm not spending
anything extra.

428
00:24:10,224 --> 00:24:13,592
No, but your lunches and your
dinners with your friends

429
00:24:13,594 --> 00:24:14,159
really add up.

430
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,261
Maybe if you did something
with a future.?

431
00:24:16,263 --> 00:24:18,797
Lane publishing
was daddy's baby.

432
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,232
But not ours.

433
00:24:20,234 --> 00:24:23,302
Your lobbying job
pays practically nothing.

434
00:24:23,304 --> 00:24:26,171
Well, at least I'm
contributing to society.

435
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:30,676
I'd like you to contribute
more to our finances.

436
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:33,812
This house is worth
less than half

437
00:24:33,814 --> 00:24:34,680
of what we paid for it.

438
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,348
Were are serious
underwater, baby.

439
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,251
You're not thinking
of selling it, are you?

440
00:24:39,253 --> 00:24:39,952
We can't.

441
00:24:39,954 --> 00:24:43,021
We don't have enough equity
to pay off the mortgage.

442
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,289
( Doorbell rings )

443
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,157
I'll get it.

444
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:46,959
I was on my way out, anyway.

445
00:24:46,961 --> 00:24:49,027
Have a nice day.

446
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:51,863
Hi, there. I noticed you might

447
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,733
need some maintenance
work done.

448
00:24:55,301 --> 00:24:57,336
Bill!

449
00:25:02,175 --> 00:25:02,808
Hi.

450
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,344
Uh, what can I do for you?

451
00:25:05,346 --> 00:25:06,345
I hope I can help you.

452
00:25:06,347 --> 00:25:08,847
I just finished several jobs
for you neighbors.

453
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:11,316
Uh, the Alexanders, proudfoots,

454
00:25:11,318 --> 00:25:12,117
and Mr. Wilson.

455
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:15,621
They can all tell you
about my work. Mmm.

456
00:25:15,623 --> 00:25:17,222
Thanks, but I really...

457
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,091
if I may. Uh...

458
00:25:19,093 --> 00:25:20,359
Some areas...

459
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:21,793
( sighs )

460
00:25:21,795 --> 00:25:24,796
Need serious repair.

461
00:25:26,265 --> 00:25:27,065
I know. Believe me.

462
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,700
Uh, look, thanks, but I can't...

463
00:25:28,702 --> 00:25:31,003
I can't really "afford" any...

464
00:25:31,005 --> 00:25:31,837
Extra help right now.

465
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:34,339
I'm a good worker
and I'm open to barter.

466
00:25:34,341 --> 00:25:38,210
Uh... What do you
have in trade?

467
00:25:57,997 --> 00:25:59,765
( Squeaks )

468
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,266
( Sighs )

469
00:26:03,202 --> 00:26:03,902
Nicki,

470
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,404
how did I get home last night?

471
00:26:05,406 --> 00:26:07,105
Nicki: <i>I don't know, but...</i>

472
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,008
<i>I got home in a '65 mustang.</i>

473
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,076
<i>Are you home now?</i>

474
00:26:11,078 --> 00:26:12,878
( Sighs ) And hung over.

475
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,213
<i>( Chuckling ) You lush.</i>

476
00:26:15,215 --> 00:26:19,117
<i>Meet me at "hooker
on a stump."</i> Okay.

477
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,024
( Gasps ) Whoa.

478
00:26:26,026 --> 00:26:27,225
Nice shoes.

479
00:26:27,227 --> 00:26:29,995
School let out early today?

480
00:26:29,997 --> 00:26:31,730
And you are?

481
00:26:31,732 --> 00:26:32,130
Mac.

482
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:35,367
Dad hired me
to work on the house.

483
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:36,968
Brilliant.

484
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,303
I'm just on my way

485
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,306
to audition
for a Christmas play.

486
00:26:41,941 --> 00:26:45,110
When you see my dad,
will you tell him that?

487
00:26:45,112 --> 00:26:47,345
And that I'll be a little late.

488
00:26:47,347 --> 00:26:48,847
Okay?

489
00:26:58,091 --> 00:26:59,725
( Squeaking )

490
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:06,031
( Child shouting indistinctly )

491
00:27:09,135 --> 00:27:11,169
Ashley: Hey. Oh.

492
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,337
Hey.

493
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,073
Do you wanna go
to a house party tonight?

494
00:27:15,075 --> 00:27:17,109
Sharon's too burned.

495
00:27:17,111 --> 00:27:17,943
I have to be back home

496
00:27:17,945 --> 00:27:20,178
before she and Jason
get back from dinner.

497
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,080
Just come for a little while.

498
00:27:22,082 --> 00:27:23,048
But you're, uh,

499
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,049
gonna have to wear something

500
00:27:24,051 --> 00:27:26,351
a <i>little</i> better than that.

501
00:27:27,153 --> 00:27:28,120
No money.

502
00:27:28,122 --> 00:27:29,154
( Scoffs )

503
00:27:29,156 --> 00:27:31,022
You know... come here.

504
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:34,893
You don't have to always
pay for everything.

505
00:27:36,462 --> 00:27:37,796
Nicki,

506
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:38,830
you shoplift?

507
00:27:38,832 --> 00:27:39,364
( Snickers )

508
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,000
Where do you think
I get all my stuff?

509
00:27:42,002 --> 00:27:43,935
<i>( Doorbell rings )</i>

510
00:27:43,937 --> 00:27:45,337
( Knocking )

511
00:27:46,205 --> 00:27:47,506
Hello, Angelina.

512
00:27:47,508 --> 00:27:48,940
( Exhales sharply )

513
00:27:48,942 --> 00:27:49,941
Hi, Mr. I.

514
00:27:49,943 --> 00:27:53,311
Um, I made this shirt
for Jason.

515
00:27:53,313 --> 00:27:54,246
I hand-embroidered it.

516
00:27:54,248 --> 00:27:56,815
You don't think it's
too feminine, do you?

517
00:27:56,817 --> 00:27:59,551
No. It reminds me
of what I used to wear.

518
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:02,120
Jason's having dinner
with his mother.

519
00:28:02,122 --> 00:28:02,954
Really? Yeah.

520
00:28:02,956 --> 00:28:06,057
You don't have to lie
if he's with another girl.

521
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,193
Oh. Come in.

522
00:28:08,195 --> 00:28:08,927
So,

523
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:10,228
what makes you think

524
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,131
he wouldn't be having dinner
with his mother?

525
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:14,466
I never see him anymore.

526
00:28:14,468 --> 00:28:16,134
Saw him last night.

527
00:28:16,136 --> 00:28:18,103
Or doesn't studying
count anymore?

528
00:28:18,105 --> 00:28:22,474
No, I haven't seen Jason
in two weeks.

529
00:28:23,142 --> 00:28:26,511
New friends are such scumbags.

530
00:28:27,847 --> 00:28:29,848
What new friends
you talking about?

531
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,483
Did Jason make this?

532
00:28:31,485 --> 00:28:32,317
Yes, he did.

533
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:35,420
That was his Christmas present
to me last year.

534
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:39,157
He made me a beautiful
jewelry box.

535
00:28:41,027 --> 00:28:44,129
You know we plan to have
our own business someday?

536
00:28:44,131 --> 00:28:46,865
Me doing the whole
clothes-design thing,

537
00:28:46,867 --> 00:28:49,334
and Jason doing his woodwork.
( Chuckles )

538
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:49,901
Nice.

539
00:28:49,903 --> 00:28:53,038
So maybe he's been
spending more time at the shop.

540
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,206
Nice try.

541
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:57,209
But they haven't seen him
in over a month.

542
00:28:57,211 --> 00:29:01,279
He even left a rocker
he was working on half-finished.

543
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,316
I don't know what
to tell you, baby.

544
00:29:04,318 --> 00:29:06,451
Well, just give him this.

545
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,485
I'll have a talk with him.

546
00:29:07,487 --> 00:29:12,057
No. I'm the one that needs
to have a talk with im.

547
00:29:13,459 --> 00:29:15,193
You're really okay, Mr. I.

548
00:29:15,195 --> 00:29:17,028
( Chuckles ) Thank you.

549
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,530
Sometimes I wonder.

550
00:29:18,532 --> 00:29:20,098
( Laughs )

551
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,634
Okay, well, I'm gonna go.

552
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:27,072
Have a good day, baby. Thanks.

553
00:29:27,074 --> 00:29:30,308
So, what's been
keeping my track star

554
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,543
away from home so much?

555
00:29:31,545 --> 00:29:34,145
It's not a girl, is it?

556
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,046
No, uh-uh.

557
00:29:35,048 --> 00:29:36,114
( Sniffles )
As a matter of fact,

558
00:29:36,116 --> 00:29:39,217
I stood up angel last night
so I could study.

559
00:29:39,219 --> 00:29:41,486
You're still seeing her?

560
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,420
( Sighs )

561
00:29:42,422 --> 00:29:45,023
Does her mother
still work at Wal-Mart?

562
00:29:45,025 --> 00:29:46,157
Whoa! Mom, for real?

563
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,359
Come on... her mom's cool,
all right?

564
00:29:47,361 --> 00:29:50,562
I mean, besides, I might need
to get a job there, myself.

565
00:29:50,564 --> 00:29:51,396
You get an allowance.

566
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:54,199
Yeah, but dad's cutting back
till I get my grades up.

567
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:56,234
I need money <i>now.</i>

568
00:29:56,236 --> 00:29:57,335
For what?

569
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,671
Something wrong?

570
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:00,405
Nuh-uh.

571
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:02,507
My cross-trainers
just gettin' old.

572
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,509
( Both chuckling ) I forgot.

573
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:09,648
At your age, things get old five
minutes ago, right? Mmm? ( Chuckles )

574
00:30:10,182 --> 00:30:12,217
How much you need, baby?

575
00:30:12,219 --> 00:30:14,486
350.

576
00:30:15,254 --> 00:30:17,322
For cross-trainers?

577
00:30:17,324 --> 00:30:18,023
Well, I mean,

578
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,958
the whole team's gettin'
these leather jackets, right?

579
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,693
( Stammering ) I guess I could
settle for a nylon jacket,

580
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:25,363
but I know you don't want your boy
rocking no nylon jacket at school.

581
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,531
( Chuckles )
I only got 150, Jay.

582
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,999
No, that's cool. That's cool.

583
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:29,034
That's enough for the shoes.

584
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,303
But we can go shopping together
for that jacket, right?

585
00:30:31,305 --> 00:30:33,438
I mean, you...
you can charge it, right?

586
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,041
( Chuckles ) Right.

587
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,275
( Both chuckling )

588
00:30:37,277 --> 00:30:39,244
You're the best, mom.

589
00:30:39,246 --> 00:30:41,046
( Paper tearing )

590
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:42,580
I love you, too, baby.

591
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:46,284
So, baby, I <i>know</i> I haven't
been to the track meets lately,

592
00:30:46,286 --> 00:30:49,421
and I'm sorry, but you know I've been
working hard with this committee.

593
00:30:49,423 --> 00:30:50,455
You know? Go green. Yeah.

594
00:30:50,457 --> 00:30:53,158
But I really wanna
talk to you about that angel.

595
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,060
What? I don't like her.

596
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:56,227
Huh? ( Stammering )

597
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,062
I just don't.

598
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:59,564
I-I just feel like she's...
In the way of your future.

599
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,701
She's needy. She didn't
even do anything to you.

600
00:31:02,703 --> 00:31:04,135
She's needy. Just saying.
( Chuckles )

601
00:31:04,137 --> 00:31:07,005
Okay, okay.
You need to try something new.

602
00:31:07,007 --> 00:31:09,107
New like what? What's new?

603
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:10,175
Keep it movin'.Com.

604
00:31:10,177 --> 00:31:12,310
What is that?
Did you just make that up?

605
00:31:12,312 --> 00:31:13,712
Well, maybe. ( Chuckles )

606
00:31:13,714 --> 00:31:17,582
Okay. Might be a site with
some new Booty on it.

607
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,384
Mom! ( Laughing )

608
00:31:19,386 --> 00:31:20,685
Ahh. ( Jason chuckling )

609
00:31:20,687 --> 00:31:22,620
The jacket looks nice on you.
Right?

610
00:31:22,622 --> 00:31:26,091
Thank you. Thank you to my mom.
( Chuckles )

611
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,762
Why are you
sitting in the dark?

612
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,297
Where were you last night?

613
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:34,099
Uh... I-I was studying

614
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:34,766
like I told you.

615
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,634
You haven seen Angelina
in weeks.

616
00:31:36,636 --> 00:31:39,070
I just figured that
studying with angel would...

617
00:31:39,072 --> 00:31:42,207
Um, just distract me
a little bit.

618
00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:43,475
He already told me.

619
00:31:43,477 --> 00:31:45,443
Just where have you been going?

620
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,112
Bill... I asked you a question.

621
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:50,215
The library. What... a guy
tries to do the right thing,

622
00:31:50,217 --> 00:31:51,383
and I get jumped for it?

623
00:31:51,385 --> 00:31:53,585
Are you trying
to do the right thing?

624
00:31:53,587 --> 00:31:54,586
Yes... ( Stammering )

625
00:31:54,588 --> 00:31:56,788
Your father's finished
with his questions.

626
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,791
Go on upstairs and study, baby.

627
00:32:04,296 --> 00:32:04,729
Well,

628
00:32:04,731 --> 00:32:07,499
you've managed to ruin
a perfectly lovely evening.

629
00:32:07,501 --> 00:32:11,403
Bill: <i>Just trying to make him
live up to his responsibilities.</i>

630
00:32:11,405 --> 00:32:13,705
<i>He only comes home</i>
<i>long enough to eat</i>

631
00:32:13,707 --> 00:32:15,073
and to ask for more money.

632
00:32:15,075 --> 00:32:17,509
Sharon: Like your daughter's
home more?

633
00:32:17,511 --> 00:32:18,576
My son's an athlete,

634
00:32:18,578 --> 00:32:21,646
and one day he's
going to be important.

635
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,482
He's important now, Sharon.

636
00:32:24,617 --> 00:32:26,317
Has it ever occurred to you
that Jason

637
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,619
doesn't even
wanna be an athlete?

638
00:32:27,621 --> 00:32:29,821
Then why is he trying so hard
to make captain?

639
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,623
He's not. If you'd come to any

640
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:33,391
of his track meets, you'd know.

641
00:32:33,393 --> 00:32:34,692
He... he'll never be captain.

642
00:32:34,694 --> 00:32:36,061
Your daughter's the loser.

643
00:32:36,063 --> 00:32:38,430
And she dresses
like trailer trash.

644
00:32:38,432 --> 00:32:39,330
( Sobbing )

645
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,399
Bill: <i>If Ashley's mother</i>
<i>was home once in a while...</i>

646
00:32:41,401 --> 00:32:45,637
oh, please. I'm up in this
dump more than I care to be.

647
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:46,738
Charming.

648
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,672
If a... maybe,

649
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,808
<i>maybe if we</i>
<i>got this place together...</i>

650
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,210
Let's get you back.

651
00:32:52,212 --> 00:32:54,279
( Sighs )

652
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,085
No life, huh?

653
00:33:00,786 --> 00:33:02,654
This is gross.

654
00:33:03,456 --> 00:33:06,524
It may not look like
much now, but, uh,

655
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,860
wait till I get the drapes up.

656
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,329
This place is a hole.

657
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:17,202
It just... Needs a little love.

658
00:33:18,304 --> 00:33:19,804
( Sighs )

659
00:33:20,573 --> 00:33:21,539
Yeah.

660
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,642
Well, don't we all?

661
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,278
Why don't you put this on?

662
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,681
It's...

663
00:33:29,683 --> 00:33:31,883
Warmer.

664
00:33:32,818 --> 00:33:33,518
( Sighs )

665
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,752
( Sniffles ) ( Sighing )

666
00:33:34,754 --> 00:33:38,189
And why don't you
take care of Willy?

667
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:44,596
Bill: What, did you guys
buy out the entire store?

668
00:33:44,598 --> 00:33:46,865
Sneaking in again?

669
00:33:46,867 --> 00:33:49,200
I just fed Willy.

670
00:33:49,202 --> 00:33:51,669
Thank you, baby.

671
00:33:53,572 --> 00:33:54,739
What was she wearing?

672
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:58,543
( Chuckles ) Looked like it
was from a thrift store.

673
00:33:59,178 --> 00:34:00,845
( Sighs )

674
00:34:35,314 --> 00:34:38,416
( Sniffing )

675
00:34:44,623 --> 00:34:45,623
Jason, I need to talk to you!

676
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,825
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather talk to my father?

677
00:34:47,827 --> 00:34:49,294
I came to see <i>you.</i>
You weren't home.

678
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,362
Why'd you tell him we haven't
been studying together?

679
00:34:51,364 --> 00:34:53,631
I didn't know you told him we were.
Look, I...

680
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,967
I just can't have any more
hassles right now.

681
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:58,303
Don't shut me out.

682
00:34:58,837 --> 00:35:00,338
Mmm.

683
00:35:05,578 --> 00:35:06,945
Let's go somewhere.

684
00:35:06,947 --> 00:35:07,779
Is your mom home?

685
00:35:07,781 --> 00:35:09,681
She leaves for work
in about an hour.

686
00:35:09,683 --> 00:35:11,382
I don't think
I can wait that long.

687
00:35:11,384 --> 00:35:14,752
Promise me you'll come over
this time.

688
00:35:14,754 --> 00:35:16,421
I love you.

689
00:35:16,423 --> 00:35:18,423
Promise.

690
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,927
Believe it.

691
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:26,931
( Sniffling )

692
00:35:31,704 --> 00:35:34,706
That is one hot
little piece of ass.

693
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:37,408
You shut up about her.
You hear me?

694
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,577
( Grunting )

695
00:35:40,379 --> 00:35:44,015
That's not how you talk to me.

696
00:35:45,484 --> 00:35:48,253
( Breathing heavily )

697
00:35:50,923 --> 00:35:52,790
Thanks.

698
00:35:53,826 --> 00:35:56,427
You, too, Willy.

699
00:35:56,962 --> 00:35:58,863
You're welcome.

700
00:36:02,835 --> 00:36:05,803
You'll make a terrific
virgin Mary.

701
00:36:05,805 --> 00:36:06,671
Shut up.

702
00:36:06,673 --> 00:36:08,806
( Stammering )
Who said I was a virgin?

703
00:36:08,808 --> 00:36:10,942
I was talking about the play.

704
00:36:10,944 --> 00:36:14,812
And being a virgin is bad
because... Why?

705
00:36:14,814 --> 00:36:16,848
'Cause nobody else is.

706
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,651
There may be one or two.

707
00:36:19,785 --> 00:36:22,453
And what play are you
talking about?

708
00:36:22,455 --> 00:36:25,290
Hello? The Christmas play.

709
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:26,958
Mary, baby Jesus,

710
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,992
wise men.

711
00:36:27,994 --> 00:36:29,294
You auditioned for it.

712
00:36:29,296 --> 00:36:31,462
( Laughs ) Remember?

713
00:36:31,597 --> 00:36:33,998
No one does that kind
of play anymore.

714
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,368
It's not politically correct.
( Chuckles )

715
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,504
Oh.

716
00:36:42,941 --> 00:36:46,544
I ran across this
when I was cleaning.

717
00:36:49,481 --> 00:36:50,481
Wait.

718
00:36:50,483 --> 00:36:53,318
Sharon was in the band
with my mom and dad?

719
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,688
Evidently. She was pregnant
and depressed.

720
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,890
Her boyfriend left her.

721
00:36:58,892 --> 00:37:00,925
She didn't want the baby.

722
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,461
The plan was for your mother
to watch after both kids

723
00:37:03,463 --> 00:37:05,563
while Sharon filled in
with the band.

724
00:37:05,565 --> 00:37:06,698
How do you know all this?

725
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,099
Your father asked me
to look over things

726
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:12,403
so I wouldn't throw out
anything important.

727
00:37:12,671 --> 00:37:14,906
This seemed important.

728
00:37:14,908 --> 00:37:17,642
And... Kinda personal.

729
00:37:17,644 --> 00:37:19,510
So I stopped reading.

730
00:37:19,512 --> 00:37:20,912
Thanks.

731
00:37:21,613 --> 00:37:24,615
Would you be willing
to do me a favor?

732
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,983
That depends.

733
00:37:25,985 --> 00:37:27,652
There's a bunch of kids
down at the shelter

734
00:37:27,654 --> 00:37:31,989
who don't know it's not politically
correct to have a Christmas play.

735
00:37:31,991 --> 00:37:33,825
They'd really like to have one,

736
00:37:33,827 --> 00:37:36,361
and I could really
use a good acting coach.

737
00:37:36,363 --> 00:37:39,697
I can't act. ( Grunts )

738
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:42,367
Huh.

739
00:37:45,037 --> 00:37:45,636
I...

740
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,940
what makes you think that's mine?
( Chuckles )

741
00:37:48,942 --> 00:37:50,641
You see?

742
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:54,479
You can give
quite a performance.

743
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:57,448
So, I have no choice.

744
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,116
No.

745
00:37:58,118 --> 00:37:59,784
But I think you'll like it.

746
00:37:59,786 --> 00:38:04,088
It's three days a week,
and a half-day Saturdays.

747
00:38:08,961 --> 00:38:09,794
( Sniffling )

748
00:38:09,796 --> 00:38:12,864
Come back to bed and hold me.

749
00:38:17,403 --> 00:38:19,704
You could at least
help me with the bed.

750
00:38:19,706 --> 00:38:21,672
You helped mess it up.

751
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,786
( Sighs )

752
00:38:53,672 --> 00:38:55,640
Don't be mad, angel.

753
00:38:55,642 --> 00:38:58,042
Do you still love me, Jason?

754
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:58,976
( Sighs )

755
00:38:58,978 --> 00:39:02,880
You're the only girl I dated
since the 7th grade.

756
00:39:03,682 --> 00:39:05,550
You never say it.

757
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:06,818
Uh...

758
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:08,653
you've been my lady

759
00:39:08,655 --> 00:39:10,087
since I first saw you
at the Halloween party

760
00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:13,591
rolling around on the floor
in that stupid pumpkin costume.

761
00:39:13,593 --> 00:39:15,026
( Chuckles )

762
00:39:18,063 --> 00:39:19,664
( Sighs )

763
00:39:20,766 --> 00:39:23,100
I'm pregnant.

764
00:39:24,736 --> 00:39:26,571
You're kidding, right?

765
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:27,638
No.

766
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,041
I did the test.

767
00:39:30,043 --> 00:39:32,710
Three times.

768
00:39:35,881 --> 00:39:37,782
What are you going to do?

769
00:39:37,784 --> 00:39:40,585
We could get married in Kentucky
on account of I'm pregnant.

770
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,553
Kentucky?
Are you out of your gourd?

771
00:39:42,555 --> 00:39:44,222
We can't keep it.

772
00:39:44,224 --> 00:39:46,657
What do you mean?

773
00:39:47,693 --> 00:39:49,560
Give me a break.

774
00:39:49,562 --> 00:39:51,028
What do you want me to do?

775
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,130
What we always talked about.

776
00:39:53,132 --> 00:39:55,967
You should've
been more careful.

777
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:57,969
"Careful" works both ways.

778
00:39:57,971 --> 00:39:59,804
What... what about all your talk

779
00:39:59,806 --> 00:40:00,972
about us being together
forever?

780
00:40:00,974 --> 00:40:02,940
I didn't mean like this week!

781
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,976
And besides, we have no money.

782
00:40:04,978 --> 00:40:07,612
You can make good money
as a carpenter.

783
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:08,980
You're great at it.

784
00:40:08,982 --> 00:40:11,215
Angel, baby...

785
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:14,519
This... Just isn't a good time

786
00:40:14,521 --> 00:40:15,286
to get married.

787
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:18,256
You can see that, can't you?

788
00:40:20,592 --> 00:40:22,159
( Sighs )

789
00:40:25,998 --> 00:40:26,797
All right,

790
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,133
I'll get the money for the abortion.
( Sighs )

791
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:32,970
Geez, all anybody ever
wants out of me is money.

792
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,906
That is not true!

793
00:40:34,908 --> 00:40:37,275
I love you, Jason.

794
00:40:37,277 --> 00:40:38,643
( Sighs )

795
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:42,179
This is our child. How can you
even think of destroying it?

796
00:40:42,181 --> 00:40:43,247
Well, you better think of it.

797
00:40:43,249 --> 00:40:45,983
'Cause I'm not
gonna be trapped by you

798
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:46,784
or anyone else.

799
00:40:46,786 --> 00:40:50,021
Don't say a word about this
to anyone.

800
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:52,723
Jason!

801
00:41:04,736 --> 00:41:08,039
Now, not everybody
will have a speaking part.

802
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:11,642
But everyone will
have a very important role.

803
00:41:11,644 --> 00:41:13,811
You all have special talents.

804
00:41:13,813 --> 00:41:16,814
Kevin doesn't. He's lame.

805
00:41:16,816 --> 00:41:19,283
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.

806
00:41:19,885 --> 00:41:22,720
Kids, I'd like you all
to meet Ms. Lane.

807
00:41:22,722 --> 00:41:25,590
Children: Hi, Ms. Lane.

808
00:41:26,325 --> 00:41:28,826
Are you Lois Lane,
superman's wife?

809
00:41:28,828 --> 00:41:32,029
No, duck-brain.
Superman's wife is old.

810
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,231
All right. Kids,
I'll be right back.

811
00:41:34,233 --> 00:41:37,234
Everyone just
behave yourselves.

812
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:41,706
You're not scared of a few
second-graders?

813
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,374
No.

814
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,310
It's the sixth-graders
that I'm worried about.

815
00:41:46,312 --> 00:41:48,713
Look, if you're
having second thoughts,

816
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:50,181
this is the time to decide.

817
00:41:50,183 --> 00:41:52,617
Uh... you're the one
who asked me to do this.

818
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,752
And I think you'll
be great at it.

819
00:41:54,754 --> 00:41:55,653
But that doesn't mean

820
00:41:55,655 --> 00:41:58,322
you can quit if you go down
and change your mind later.

821
00:41:58,324 --> 00:42:00,157
Give me your word.

822
00:42:06,331 --> 00:42:09,200
Yeah. You have my word.

823
00:42:09,202 --> 00:42:10,067
Good.

824
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,002
The second chapter of Luke

825
00:42:11,004 --> 00:42:13,404
is the theme for the script
we're gonna need.

826
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:16,841
Wait, you want me
to help write the script?

827
00:42:16,843 --> 00:42:17,675
No.

828
00:42:17,677 --> 00:42:19,944
I want you to write it.

829
00:42:20,178 --> 00:42:23,814
Oh, and by the way,
we need 17 speaking parts.

830
00:42:23,816 --> 00:42:25,650
( Whispering ) Seventeen?

831
00:42:25,652 --> 00:42:28,252
Everyone that wants
to work on scenery,

832
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:31,122
come this way.

833
00:42:32,024 --> 00:42:33,791
( Cheering )

834
00:42:33,793 --> 00:42:36,093
Go, Jason! Whoo!

835
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,695
Oh, no.

836
00:42:38,397 --> 00:42:41,098
( Cheering )

837
00:42:44,102 --> 00:42:46,937
( Indistinct cheering )

838
00:42:53,412 --> 00:42:55,980
Oh, buddy.

839
00:42:59,685 --> 00:43:02,119
( Sniffing )

840
00:43:03,388 --> 00:43:06,323
( Shouting in distance )

841
00:43:06,325 --> 00:43:08,759
( Shouting continues )

842
00:43:16,234 --> 00:43:19,003
( Shouting )

843
00:43:20,405 --> 00:43:22,840
I warned you about that
superstar stuff, Lane!

844
00:43:22,842 --> 00:43:25,409
But coach, if Hank had just been
there for me when I reached back,

845
00:43:25,411 --> 00:43:27,445
none of this would've happened.
Bullshit!

846
00:43:27,447 --> 00:43:28,913
You started too soon.

847
00:43:28,915 --> 00:43:32,316
And when Hank was closing in
on you, you sped up,

848
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,084
crossed lanes,

849
00:43:33,086 --> 00:43:34,852
disqualified the whole team.

850
00:43:34,854 --> 00:43:38,456
This sport isn't all about you.

851
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:39,490
Get it

852
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:41,192
I can change, coach.

853
00:43:41,194 --> 00:43:42,159
I can.

854
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,328
Show me.

855
00:44:01,346 --> 00:44:03,481
( Sighs )

856
00:44:17,763 --> 00:44:19,430
( Sighs )

857
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:23,768
( Coughs )

858
00:44:43,455 --> 00:44:44,421
( Sighs )

859
00:44:44,423 --> 00:44:47,158
( Dance music playing )

860
00:45:05,143 --> 00:45:06,877
( Sighs )

861
00:45:07,813 --> 00:45:09,513
That was too close for me.

862
00:45:09,515 --> 00:45:12,883
I don't know why you
made such a big deal out of it.

863
00:45:12,885 --> 00:45:15,486
Just sunglasses.

864
00:45:15,488 --> 00:45:17,521
We were stealing.

865
00:45:17,523 --> 00:45:20,191
That's not okay.

866
00:45:22,127 --> 00:45:22,827
( Sighs )

867
00:45:22,829 --> 00:45:26,597
There's gotta be a better way
to enjoy life.

868
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,366
Oh, there is.

869
00:45:29,368 --> 00:45:31,468
He's comin' right this way.

870
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:34,405
Hi, I'm Ken.

871
00:45:34,407 --> 00:45:36,373
And you are?

872
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:37,575
Barbie.

873
00:45:37,577 --> 00:45:39,109
I'm Barbie.

874
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,111
You like to dance?

875
00:45:41,246 --> 00:45:44,481
Only if you buy me
a pink house.

876
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:47,885
Some friends
are having a party later.

877
00:45:47,887 --> 00:45:49,386
Wanna come?

878
00:45:49,388 --> 00:45:51,622
( Music fades )

879
00:45:53,158 --> 00:45:55,559
Cheers, darling.

880
00:46:01,867 --> 00:46:04,235
( Music continues )
Tell Nicole I had to leave.

881
00:46:04,237 --> 00:46:08,138
Nicole? I thought her name
was Barbie.

882
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,940
Hey, Jay.

883
00:46:10,075 --> 00:46:13,010
You just gonna walk in
and not speak?

884
00:46:13,545 --> 00:46:15,212
Hey.

885
00:46:16,381 --> 00:46:18,115
How was the meet?

886
00:46:18,117 --> 00:46:19,350
You were supposed to come.

887
00:46:19,352 --> 00:46:21,385
I know baby, but...

888
00:46:21,387 --> 00:46:23,020
The protest got started late.

889
00:46:23,022 --> 00:46:24,955
Somebody forgot
to bring their permit.

890
00:46:24,957 --> 00:46:26,557
You know... spare me, mom.

891
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,258
I'm sorry.

892
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,326
I'm gonna go hang out
with some of the guys.

893
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,061
I'm already running late. So...

894
00:46:31,063 --> 00:46:32,930
( Snaps fingers )
Oh, by the way.

895
00:46:32,932 --> 00:46:34,398
I, uh... I need some money.

896
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,368
I just gave you some. What happened
to the money that I gave you?

897
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:41,105
You know I'm a growing boy.
I gotta eat, right?

898
00:46:41,107 --> 00:46:41,605
Uh, well,

899
00:46:41,607 --> 00:46:44,441
you are eatin' me
out of house and home.

900
00:46:44,443 --> 00:46:46,343
Here's a 20.

901
00:46:46,544 --> 00:46:48,078
Where's your jacket at?

902
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,546
It's cold outside.

903
00:46:49,548 --> 00:46:50,281
Uh, I, uh...

904
00:46:50,283 --> 00:46:53,417
Left it in my locker earlier.
( Sniffles )

905
00:46:53,419 --> 00:46:55,920
Can I get a hug?

906
00:46:56,488 --> 00:46:58,155
( Chuckles )

907
00:46:59,457 --> 00:47:00,925
Mmm.

908
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:06,497
Be careful, Jay.

909
00:47:09,234 --> 00:47:10,434
Um, Sharon?

910
00:47:10,436 --> 00:47:12,369
Yes? Have you seen Mac?

911
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:15,472
We're supposed to work
on a project together.

912
00:47:15,474 --> 00:47:17,308
No, I haven't.

913
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:18,943
But you're home early.

914
00:47:18,945 --> 00:47:21,612
You look good. I'm impressed.

915
00:47:21,614 --> 00:47:22,413
Thanks.

916
00:47:22,415 --> 00:47:26,016
Your father and I are gonna go
to a go green benefit tonight.

917
00:47:26,018 --> 00:47:28,085
You'll be okay by yourself?

918
00:47:28,087 --> 00:47:31,221
Yeah. Have a good time.

919
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,490
I like those shoes.

920
00:47:36,294 --> 00:47:37,561
Hmm.

921
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,703
( Door squeaks )

922
00:47:52,677 --> 00:47:54,278
( Knocking )

923
00:48:00,018 --> 00:48:00,617
Wow.

924
00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:02,286
Look at this place.

925
00:48:02,288 --> 00:48:04,321
How's the play coming?

926
00:48:04,323 --> 00:48:07,391
Do you own a dress coat?

927
00:48:07,393 --> 00:48:08,392
Yes.

928
00:48:08,394 --> 00:48:10,728
Why do you ask?

929
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:11,628
I couldn't find Luke.

930
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:15,065
There's a table of contents
in the front of the book.

931
00:48:15,067 --> 00:48:19,136
Or you could just Google it.

932
00:48:21,473 --> 00:48:23,240
( Sighs )

933
00:48:25,076 --> 00:48:26,643
( Grunts )

934
00:48:34,185 --> 00:48:35,786
Don't you look handsome?

935
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:36,553
So do you, honey.

936
00:48:36,555 --> 00:48:38,489
I love that dress. Thank you.

937
00:48:38,491 --> 00:48:39,256
( Clears throat )

938
00:48:39,258 --> 00:48:42,626
Can you believe that Ashley
and I had a conversation today?

939
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,428
You did? Oh, yeah.

940
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:45,262
About what?

941
00:48:45,264 --> 00:48:46,330
Well, she's working on, uh,

942
00:48:46,332 --> 00:48:49,700
some new project,
and I encouraged her.

943
00:48:49,702 --> 00:48:52,302
Oh, baby. Mm-hmm.

944
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,038
Thank you. Ooh ooh.

945
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,540
( Giggling )
Uh... watch out, now.

946
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:57,574
( Laughs )

947
00:48:57,576 --> 00:49:00,210
Actually I should
be thanking you.

948
00:49:00,212 --> 00:49:00,811
For what?

949
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:02,346
Well, for the garden,

950
00:49:02,348 --> 00:49:04,748
the bushes, the new flowers.

951
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:05,416
Mm-hmm.

952
00:49:05,418 --> 00:49:09,686
I can actually park the car
in the garage again.

953
00:49:09,688 --> 00:49:10,554
Who knew?

954
00:49:10,556 --> 00:49:13,290
You're the best. Mwah.

955
00:49:13,292 --> 00:49:14,124
Mm-hmm.

956
00:49:14,126 --> 00:49:15,392
Oh, do you have a 20?

957
00:49:15,394 --> 00:49:17,361
Here you go.

958
00:49:19,664 --> 00:49:21,465
Bill, you only have a 20.

959
00:49:21,467 --> 00:49:23,667
Nah, I've got a 20 and a 50.

960
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:24,435
Mmm, no. Look.

961
00:49:24,437 --> 00:49:26,370
Only a 20.
Don't worry about it.

962
00:49:26,372 --> 00:49:28,305
I-I'll go to the bank
tomorrow, okay?

963
00:49:28,307 --> 00:49:29,740
Grab an arm. Fo' sho'.

964
00:49:29,742 --> 00:49:33,110
Here we go. ( Chuckles )

965
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:37,214
( Train horn blowing )

966
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,354
( Grunts )

967
00:49:45,156 --> 00:49:47,591
I just need some stuff.

968
00:49:47,593 --> 00:49:49,359
And?

969
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,627
I, uh...

970
00:49:50,629 --> 00:49:53,197
I brought... I brought money.

971
00:50:05,477 --> 00:50:07,811
What's wrong?

972
00:50:09,114 --> 00:50:10,481
Huh?

973
00:50:11,483 --> 00:50:14,151
Wait! Please, please, I'm sick.

974
00:50:14,153 --> 00:50:16,253
( Grunting )

975
00:50:21,459 --> 00:50:22,459
( Gasping )

976
00:50:22,461 --> 00:50:23,794
( Coughing )

977
00:50:23,796 --> 00:50:27,798
Please, please, please, guys.

978
00:50:29,467 --> 00:50:31,401
( Jason coughing )

979
00:50:32,337 --> 00:50:32,803
Please.

980
00:50:32,805 --> 00:50:35,839
I'll do whatever you want!

981
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:37,674
I'm begging you, geo.

982
00:50:37,676 --> 00:50:38,675
Please.

983
00:50:38,677 --> 00:50:39,343
Please!

984
00:50:39,345 --> 00:50:42,513
Then you're working with roach.

985
00:50:43,882 --> 00:50:44,848
Ashley, you okay?

986
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:46,717
Where'd you go the other night?

987
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:48,285
I gotta write a play.

988
00:50:48,287 --> 00:50:51,221
Did you just say,
"write a play"?

989
00:50:51,223 --> 00:50:51,922
I gotta go.

990
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:55,425
It's just not as much fun
without you.

991
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:57,261
Then go home for a change.

992
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:59,563
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

993
00:50:59,898 --> 00:51:02,366
( Softly ) Okay.

994
00:51:08,406 --> 00:51:10,641
¶

995
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:06,663
( no audible dialogue )

996
00:52:10,969 --> 00:52:13,971
I've never read that before.

997
00:52:13,973 --> 00:52:15,239
That's good.

998
00:52:15,241 --> 00:52:17,774
You'll write
with a fresh perspective.

999
00:52:17,776 --> 00:52:18,742
( Toy squeaks )

1000
00:52:18,744 --> 00:52:20,310
( Sighs ) I still don't know

1001
00:52:20,312 --> 00:52:23,547
how I'm gonna
get 17 parts out of it.

1002
00:52:23,948 --> 00:52:26,516
Put yourself
in their positions.

1003
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,485
What would you think?

1004
00:52:29,921 --> 00:52:32,856
Yeah, but 17 parts?

1005
00:52:32,991 --> 00:52:35,292
When was the last time
you saw a bunch of people

1006
00:52:35,294 --> 00:52:37,761
get together and <i>not</i>
have a lot to say?

1007
00:52:37,763 --> 00:52:40,864
( Toy squeaks )
All the time at my house.

1008
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,599
( Chuckles )

1009
00:52:43,501 --> 00:52:44,901
Bring it back.

1010
00:52:45,536 --> 00:52:47,271
Come here.

1011
00:52:47,939 --> 00:52:49,273
Good boy.

1012
00:52:49,275 --> 00:52:51,708
( Sighs ) Good boy.

1013
00:52:56,748 --> 00:52:58,782
Nick. What happened?

1014
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:01,985
Did Ken do this?

1015
00:53:02,687 --> 00:53:04,788
I just went home

1016
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:06,690
like you said.

1017
00:53:07,725 --> 00:53:09,593
My old man was drunk again.

1018
00:53:09,595 --> 00:53:11,895
I should've known better.

1019
00:53:14,465 --> 00:53:16,933
It's not your fault.

1020
00:53:18,569 --> 00:53:20,470
( Sniffles ) You're safe now.

1021
00:53:20,472 --> 00:53:23,607
( Crying ) Let's get
you to a hospital.

1022
00:53:23,609 --> 00:53:25,475
No.

1023
00:53:26,544 --> 00:53:28,779
Don't be afraid.

1024
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,548
Let me help you.

1025
00:53:34,018 --> 00:53:37,587
I'll... Get a first aid kit.

1026
00:53:40,692 --> 00:53:42,893
Let's get you inside.

1027
00:53:44,462 --> 00:53:46,596
Trust me.

1028
00:53:51,402 --> 00:53:52,436
( Sighs )

1029
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:53,770
( Sniffles )

1030
00:53:58,409 --> 00:54:00,477
Okay, all right.

1031
00:54:04,015 --> 00:54:05,549
( Sighs )

1032
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:11,054
( Grunts ) ( Whimpers )

1033
00:54:11,056 --> 00:54:12,856
All right.

1034
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:18,962
( Sighs )

1035
00:54:20,765 --> 00:54:22,466
( Groans )

1036
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,702
( Sighs )

1037
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:27,938
( Sighs )

1038
00:54:31,676 --> 00:54:33,477
( Sighs )

1039
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:38,148
Why does he hate me?

1040
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,117
He hates himself.

1041
00:54:41,085 --> 00:54:43,420
Why does he do this to me?

1042
00:54:43,422 --> 00:54:45,956
He doesn't know love.

1043
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:47,557
That makes him dangerous.

1044
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:49,126
No shit.

1045
00:54:49,128 --> 00:54:51,728
He's a monster.

1046
00:54:53,564 --> 00:54:55,899
How do I make him stop?

1047
00:54:55,901 --> 00:54:57,067
You can't.

1048
00:54:57,069 --> 00:54:59,669
So I just let him
keep beating me?

1049
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:02,706
I definitely
don't recommend that.

1050
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:04,608
Then what?

1051
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:06,510
Do you want things to change?

1052
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:09,146
That's an insane question.

1053
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,782
Then you need to report this
to the police.

1054
00:55:11,784 --> 00:55:13,517
What he did was criminal.

1055
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:14,785
He'll kill me.

1056
00:55:14,787 --> 00:55:17,521
Look, I know you're scared.

1057
00:55:17,655 --> 00:55:19,623
It's a difficult decision.

1058
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:21,024
I understand.

1059
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:24,561
But it's one
you've got to make.

1060
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,864
He won't stop.

1061
00:55:30,568 --> 00:55:32,969
Ever consider leaving home?

1062
00:55:32,971 --> 00:55:35,939
Only every day.

1063
00:55:35,941 --> 00:55:36,740
I'm 17.

1064
00:55:36,742 --> 00:55:38,208
I don't got a place to go.

1065
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:42,179
I don't want to end up
sleeping on the streets.

1066
00:55:43,614 --> 00:55:46,183
You can stay with me.

1067
00:55:47,952 --> 00:55:51,154
It's the first place he'd look.

1068
00:55:53,958 --> 00:55:56,626
This is the number
for a friend of mine.

1069
00:55:56,628 --> 00:55:59,996
Her father had a lot
in common with yours.

1070
00:55:59,998 --> 00:56:02,032
She can give you
a place to stay

1071
00:56:02,034 --> 00:56:05,035
right now, if you want it.

1072
00:56:11,843 --> 00:56:13,977
Yeah, okay.

1073
00:56:13,979 --> 00:56:15,145
Okay.

1074
00:56:15,147 --> 00:56:16,179
Good.

1075
00:56:16,181 --> 00:56:20,884
And if you're up for riding a bike,
I'll take you there tonight.

1076
00:56:21,486 --> 00:56:23,253
( Whimpers ) Sorry.

1077
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:26,556
It's gonna burn a little.

1078
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,228
Thank God you're home.

1079
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:34,564
Where else would I be?

1080
00:56:35,533 --> 00:56:36,566
<i>( Voicemail beeps )</i>

1081
00:56:36,568 --> 00:56:38,201
It's me, Nick.

1082
00:56:38,203 --> 00:56:39,269
Where are you?

1083
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:43,907
I've left tons
of messages and texts.

1084
00:56:43,909 --> 00:56:45,809
Call me.

1085
00:56:46,744 --> 00:56:49,513
Why won't you just tell me
where you took Nicki?

1086
00:56:49,515 --> 00:56:52,115
I promise I won't tell anybody.

1087
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,518
I gave her my word.

1088
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,051
She's okay.

1089
00:56:55,053 --> 00:56:57,854
She'll be in touch
when she's ready.

1090
00:56:57,856 --> 00:57:01,191
Okay, guys.
Um, there are 17 parts

1091
00:57:01,193 --> 00:57:02,692
and we need some singers.

1092
00:57:02,694 --> 00:57:04,895
So, who can sing?

1093
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:12,235
Oh, Mr. blackman?

1094
00:57:12,237 --> 00:57:14,871
I'm working on a play
down at the shelter,

1095
00:57:14,873 --> 00:57:17,207
and we need to find costumes
and props...

1096
00:57:17,209 --> 00:57:21,278
young lady, our department
is grossly underfunded

1097
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,245
and understaffed.

1098
00:57:22,247 --> 00:57:23,880
We need those things ourselves.

1099
00:57:23,882 --> 00:57:26,616
I wasn't asking for things.

1100
00:57:26,618 --> 00:57:27,617
Just advice.

1101
00:57:27,619 --> 00:57:30,987
Well, I'm sorry
I can't help you.

1102
00:57:31,622 --> 00:57:32,989
Mr. Evans,

1103
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,190
you've been told before

1104
00:57:34,192 --> 00:57:37,093
we cannot have that
horrible smell in here.

1105
00:57:37,095 --> 00:57:38,595
They're sanding
down in the shop.

1106
00:57:38,597 --> 00:57:41,898
And if you don't want your backdrop
covered in sawdust, I can't do it there.

1107
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,167
Yeah, well, you can't
do it here, either.

1108
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,169
There's nowhere else.

1109
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,271
Maybe you'd rather I quit.

1110
00:57:48,273 --> 00:57:48,939
Fine,

1111
00:57:48,941 --> 00:57:51,608
as long as you
return the paint and supplies

1112
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:55,612
you were advanced
for your personal use.

1113
00:57:55,614 --> 00:57:56,780
Good-bye.

1114
00:57:56,782 --> 00:57:58,582
( Sighs )

1115
00:58:01,752 --> 00:58:03,320
Do I know you?

1116
00:58:03,322 --> 00:58:05,155
You look familiar.

1117
00:58:05,157 --> 00:58:06,256
You don't.

1118
00:58:06,258 --> 00:58:07,991
Are you always this friendly?

1119
00:58:07,993 --> 00:58:09,793
Only when I've just been fired.

1120
00:58:09,795 --> 00:58:11,728
Oh, let me give you a hand.

1121
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:12,829
I'm Ashley.

1122
00:58:12,831 --> 00:58:14,631
Jonathan.

1123
00:58:17,001 --> 00:58:19,769
Oh. ( Chuckles )

1124
00:58:27,078 --> 00:58:28,912
Thanks.

1125
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:42,359
Jonathan: I know it's a mess,
but can I give you a lift?

1126
00:58:42,361 --> 00:58:43,827
Are you kidding?

1127
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:45,862
It's a real car!

1128
00:58:45,864 --> 00:58:46,763
Is it yours?

1129
00:58:46,765 --> 00:58:47,964
Actually, it's a van.

1130
00:58:47,966 --> 00:58:49,833
It's not completely
paid for yet,

1131
00:58:49,835 --> 00:58:51,968
but it's more or less mine.

1132
00:58:52,336 --> 00:58:54,804
( Van doors shut )

1133
00:58:56,974 --> 00:59:00,010
I'll get that for you. Oh.

1134
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:02,112
Thank you.

1135
00:59:10,388 --> 00:59:12,255
( Clicks tongue )

1136
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:17,193
You're, um...

1137
00:59:17,195 --> 00:59:18,962
Different.

1138
00:59:18,964 --> 00:59:22,699
I'll... Take that
as a compliment.

1139
00:59:23,668 --> 00:59:27,303
So, you do, like, what?

1140
00:59:27,305 --> 00:59:28,738
Stage painting?

1141
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:30,140
Um, well, you know,

1142
00:59:30,142 --> 00:59:31,908
blackman needed
some cheap labor,

1143
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:35,412
and I needed some supplies
and a space to work.

1144
00:59:35,746 --> 00:59:38,948
Course, now I
don't have either.

1145
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:41,351
I have an idea.

1146
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:43,753
I'll alert the media.

1147
00:59:43,755 --> 00:59:45,221
( Chuckles )

1148
00:59:45,223 --> 00:59:47,323
( Engine starts )

1149
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:48,925
Your line.

1150
00:59:48,927 --> 00:59:49,459
Hey. Hey.

1151
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:52,896
Uh, guys, do you mind helping me
out a little bit? Yeah, yeah.

1152
00:59:52,898 --> 00:59:54,297
Thank you.

1153
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,399
( Indistinct chattering )
Uh, Mac,

1154
00:59:56,401 --> 00:59:57,233
this is Jonathan.

1155
00:59:57,235 --> 01:00:00,403
Jonathan, this is the guy that
I was telling you about. Hey.

1156
01:00:00,405 --> 01:00:01,838
Don't tell me.

1157
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,007
Ashley offered you
a place to work

1158
01:00:04,009 --> 01:00:08,178
if you do a simple
backdrop for our play.

1159
01:00:08,913 --> 01:00:10,080
Yeah.

1160
01:00:10,082 --> 01:00:13,016
Uh, so are you in charge here?

1161
01:00:13,018 --> 01:00:14,384
Allegedly.

1162
01:00:14,386 --> 01:00:15,418
I'm just a volunteer.

1163
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,487
Uh, what do you need?

1164
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,923
( Sighs )
An area that's off-limits

1165
01:00:19,925 --> 01:00:21,825
would be <i>really</i> helpful.

1166
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:23,226
Yeah. This way.

1167
01:00:23,228 --> 01:00:24,260
Okay, good job, everybody.

1168
01:00:24,262 --> 01:00:26,996
I'll be right back.
Memorize your lines.

1169
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,966
Ms. Lane, Kevin took my script
to the bathroom

1170
01:00:29,968 --> 01:00:33,470
and flushed it,
but it wouldn't go down.

1171
01:00:33,472 --> 01:00:36,005
We'll see about that.

1172
01:00:36,807 --> 01:00:37,240
Jonathan?

1173
01:00:37,242 --> 01:00:39,943
Would you mind going
to the little boys' room

1174
01:00:39,945 --> 01:00:44,948
and retrieving Darlene's
script back, please?

1175
01:00:48,385 --> 01:00:50,453
( Chuckles )

1176
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:53,957
Hey, um,

1177
01:00:53,959 --> 01:00:55,825
m-maybe after we're
finished today,

1178
01:00:55,827 --> 01:00:57,160
I could give you a ride home?

1179
01:00:57,162 --> 01:00:59,963
Unless you have,
like, other plans

1180
01:00:59,965 --> 01:01:01,131
or something.

1181
01:01:01,133 --> 01:01:02,065
No!

1182
01:01:02,067 --> 01:01:04,134
I mean, yes.

1183
01:01:04,136 --> 01:01:06,202
I never have plans.

1184
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:09,005
I-I mean I don't
have plans today.

1185
01:01:09,007 --> 01:01:12,108
I... that is...
Plans to rehearse,

1186
01:01:12,343 --> 01:01:14,477
but nothing after that.

1187
01:01:15,212 --> 01:01:15,979
( Sighs )

1188
01:01:15,981 --> 01:01:17,380
I'd love a ride.

1189
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:19,549
Okay.

1190
01:01:20,518 --> 01:01:23,052
( Mouthing silently )

1191
01:01:24,121 --> 01:01:25,321
Has Jason left already?

1192
01:01:25,323 --> 01:01:27,490
I couldn't wake him.
He's still upstairs.

1193
01:01:27,492 --> 01:01:29,492
Don't talk with your
mouth full.

1194
01:01:29,494 --> 01:01:30,927
Have you seen my
diamond earrings?

1195
01:01:30,929 --> 01:01:33,897
You didn't borrow them
or anything, did you?

1196
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,565
No, I haven't.

1197
01:01:36,367 --> 01:01:39,169
You've been looking nice
recently.

1198
01:01:39,171 --> 01:01:40,336
Well, I have been...

1199
01:01:40,338 --> 01:01:43,106
I've been talking
to this guy, and...

1200
01:01:43,108 --> 01:01:44,207
ahh.

1201
01:01:44,209 --> 01:01:47,277
Yeah, he's... oh, just a sec.

1202
01:01:47,279 --> 01:01:48,178
Hello?

1203
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:50,079
Are you serious?

1204
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:50,513
What?!

1205
01:01:50,515 --> 01:01:52,248
I needed those boards,
like, yesterday.

1206
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:56,386
How else are we gonna motivate
these people to go green?

1207
01:01:56,388 --> 01:01:58,855
Yes! Motivation, okay?

1208
01:01:58,857 --> 01:02:00,323
What a concept.

1209
01:02:00,991 --> 01:02:02,125
( Squeals )

1210
01:02:02,127 --> 01:02:04,127
Where have you been, girl?

1211
01:02:04,129 --> 01:02:06,362
You haven't answered
any of my calls.

1212
01:02:06,364 --> 01:02:07,197
I've been worried.

1213
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:10,967
I'm not living at home
anymore, so I just...

1214
01:02:10,969 --> 01:02:12,235
Left my phone there.

1215
01:02:12,237 --> 01:02:13,436
Where are you staying?

1216
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:14,504
Are you all right?

1217
01:02:14,506 --> 01:02:16,105
You look fabulous.

1218
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,307
Thanks.

1219
01:02:17,309 --> 01:02:19,275
You do, too. Uh...

1220
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:21,511
Do you wanna
do something tonight?

1221
01:02:21,513 --> 01:02:24,948
I have to figure out how
to costume 17 kids

1222
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,015
with no money.

1223
01:02:26,017 --> 01:02:27,250
Wanna help?

1224
01:02:27,252 --> 01:02:29,452
No, I don't think so.

1225
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:30,353
Really gotten carried away

1226
01:02:30,355 --> 01:02:32,322
with this whole
volunteering thing, huh?

1227
01:02:32,324 --> 01:02:34,157
Yeah, the kids love doing it.

1228
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:35,158
It'll be fun.

1229
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,927
Besides, we need to talk.

1230
01:02:37,929 --> 01:02:39,329
Not really.

1231
01:02:39,331 --> 01:02:42,198
Just... at least not yet.

1232
01:02:42,466 --> 01:02:45,435
See you around, though.

1233
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:48,071
Okay.

1234
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:54,344
I've... Really missed you.

1235
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,649
Yeah, me too.

1236
01:03:06,223 --> 01:03:08,892
Hit the showers, men.

1237
01:03:08,894 --> 01:03:10,293
Hank.

1238
01:03:10,295 --> 01:03:11,227
Yeah, coach?

1239
01:03:11,229 --> 01:03:13,329
What's up with Lane?
Where is he?

1240
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:15,899
I... you'll have to ask him,
coach.

1241
01:03:15,901 --> 01:03:18,234
I'm asking you.

1242
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:21,337
( Knocking )

1243
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:24,140
Hi, princess.

1244
01:03:24,142 --> 01:03:25,241
Hey.

1245
01:03:25,243 --> 01:03:26,509
What's up?

1246
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,211
So, you know that junk

1247
01:03:28,213 --> 01:03:31,381
that Mac has been
cleaning out of the garage?

1248
01:03:31,383 --> 01:03:33,082
Can I have it?

1249
01:03:33,084 --> 01:03:34,684
Why do you want it?

1250
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:35,518
To sell.

1251
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,386
You know that mack and I

1252
01:03:36,388 --> 01:03:38,388
have been working on this
Christmas play.

1253
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:39,956
Mac is too old for you.

1254
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:43,226
Dad. Give me some credit.

1255
01:03:43,228 --> 01:03:43,693
Ew.

1256
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:44,994
( Chuckling ) Okay.

1257
01:03:44,996 --> 01:03:48,698
Ah, whatever you can make
off the stuff in the garage

1258
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,633
is yours to keep.

1259
01:03:53,504 --> 01:03:56,005
Something else?

1260
01:03:56,607 --> 01:03:57,307
Well, I...

1261
01:03:57,309 --> 01:04:01,077
Found this poster of your band
in the garage.

1262
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:03,112
You guys used to rock.

1263
01:04:03,114 --> 01:04:03,713
You were hot.

1264
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:06,215
( Chuckling ) Ashley.

1265
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:09,285
How would you like to perform again?
I wouldn't.

1266
01:04:09,287 --> 01:04:10,086
Dad, please?

1267
01:04:10,088 --> 01:04:12,722
( Scoffs ) Our play would
be so huge with music.

1268
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:15,591
It's just so... <i>Almost</i> now.

1269
01:04:15,593 --> 01:04:18,962
This production
needs to be big.

1270
01:04:18,964 --> 01:04:20,563
Bill: You want me to sing?

1271
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:23,199
And play keyboard.

1272
01:04:28,038 --> 01:04:29,706
Hmm.

1273
01:04:30,641 --> 01:04:34,477
Well, Sharon and I
used to do duets.

1274
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,347
That's the deal.

1275
01:04:37,349 --> 01:04:39,749
Me and your mom,

1276
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:41,551
'kay?

1277
01:04:42,286 --> 01:04:44,087
Wow.

1278
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:47,256
Well, I...
I guess that could work.

1279
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:49,258
Okay, well, I gotta go.

1280
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,627
I have a date.

1281
01:04:52,329 --> 01:04:54,297
I'd like to meet him.

1282
01:04:54,299 --> 01:04:56,432
This date.

1283
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,201
So I, uh,

1284
01:04:58,203 --> 01:05:00,169
used to sneak
into people's back yards

1285
01:05:00,171 --> 01:05:03,272
and steal charcoal
from the barbeques

1286
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:07,510
so I could draw my murals
on buildings and sidewalks.

1287
01:05:08,178 --> 01:05:10,179
I was just a kid.

1288
01:05:10,181 --> 01:05:10,580
Wow.

1289
01:05:10,582 --> 01:05:14,183
Your neighbors
must've loved you.

1290
01:05:15,486 --> 01:05:16,753
We were never
around long enough

1291
01:05:16,755 --> 01:05:20,490
for anyone to notice
one way or the other.

1292
01:05:24,528 --> 01:05:26,629
( Chuckles )

1293
01:05:31,735 --> 01:05:33,036
But you didn't quit.

1294
01:05:33,038 --> 01:05:36,239
Jonathan: There was one person
who said I had potential.

1295
01:05:36,241 --> 01:05:37,707
It was the cop that caught me.

1296
01:05:37,709 --> 01:05:41,778
Made me whitewash the entire side
of the building I'd just finished.

1297
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:42,712
( Groans ) That sucks.

1298
01:05:42,714 --> 01:05:48,451
Turns out the owner had rented it out
to a billboard company for big bucks.

1299
01:05:48,619 --> 01:05:50,119
That cop got me my first job.

1300
01:05:50,121 --> 01:05:53,289
Priming building sides
for advertising.

1301
01:05:53,291 --> 01:05:55,625
I've had way worse
jobs, though.

1302
01:05:55,627 --> 01:05:56,626
A way to make money.

1303
01:05:56,628 --> 01:05:59,462
What made you keep at it?

1304
01:05:59,464 --> 01:06:00,763
( Sighs )

1305
01:06:00,765 --> 01:06:04,067
Would've been pretty hard
to stop me.

1306
01:06:05,135 --> 01:06:06,335
Until recently,

1307
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:09,305
I only lived
and breathed painting.

1308
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,241
( Grunts )

1309
01:06:12,643 --> 01:06:14,577
( Knocking on door )

1310
01:06:21,452 --> 01:06:22,285
Hey.

1311
01:06:22,287 --> 01:06:24,087
Jason's not here.

1312
01:06:24,089 --> 01:06:27,290
It's nice to see you, too.

1313
01:06:27,292 --> 01:06:29,125
Can I come in?

1314
01:06:29,127 --> 01:06:30,827
Yeah, sure.

1315
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:37,567
I need to have 17 costumes
made for my Christmas play.

1316
01:06:37,569 --> 01:06:39,669
How much are you paying?

1317
01:06:39,671 --> 01:06:42,405
Well, actually... Nothing.

1318
01:06:42,407 --> 01:06:44,307
But it's for a good cause.

1319
01:06:44,309 --> 01:06:45,108
Well, please?

1320
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:46,576
We're practically family.

1321
01:06:46,578 --> 01:06:48,444
( Chuckles ) I barely know you.

1322
01:06:48,446 --> 01:06:51,714
And your mother won't even
stay in the same room with me.

1323
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:53,583
Eh... <i>step-mother,</i>
and consider yourself lucky.

1324
01:06:53,585 --> 01:06:56,185
Five minutes with her
and you're late for the door.

1325
01:06:56,187 --> 01:06:58,588
Whatever. I still need
to earn some cash now.

1326
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:01,824
Um, we're having a garage
sale next week.

1327
01:07:01,826 --> 01:07:05,161
Whatever we make,
over our expenses,

1328
01:07:05,163 --> 01:07:05,895
is yours.

1329
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:07,697
Please say you'll help.

1330
01:07:07,699 --> 01:07:08,831
I'm desperate.

1331
01:07:08,833 --> 01:07:10,433
Okay, I'll tell you what.

1332
01:07:10,435 --> 01:07:12,135
If you'll help me
with these alterations,

1333
01:07:12,137 --> 01:07:15,304
that'll give me some time
to help you make costumes.

1334
01:07:15,306 --> 01:07:16,439
I can't sew.

1335
01:07:16,441 --> 01:07:17,673
I'll teach you.

1336
01:07:17,675 --> 01:07:18,875
Otherwise, no deal.

1337
01:07:18,877 --> 01:07:21,310
But I don't have time
for anything else.

1338
01:07:21,312 --> 01:07:22,378
( Chuckles )
Welcome to my world.

1339
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:27,717
Well, if you really think old
"brainless" can help. ( Sighs )

1340
01:07:31,688 --> 01:07:33,189
Wow.

1341
01:07:37,194 --> 01:07:38,761
What do you think?

1342
01:07:39,596 --> 01:07:40,730
It's great.

1343
01:07:40,732 --> 01:07:42,265
So you wanna try it?

1344
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:44,467
Um, sure.

1345
01:07:44,668 --> 01:07:46,435
( Softly ) I don't...

1346
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:47,537
Know what I'm doing.

1347
01:07:47,539 --> 01:07:49,739
( Chuckles ) Just try it.

1348
01:07:49,741 --> 01:07:51,641
Okay. Stick it in.

1349
01:07:51,643 --> 01:07:52,441
Mm-hmm.

1350
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:53,709
Does it matter what this...

1351
01:07:53,711 --> 01:07:54,677
mm-mmm. Is this...

1352
01:07:54,679 --> 01:07:57,613
we're worried
about the longer one.

1353
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:59,382
¶ Lift me up

1354
01:07:59,384 --> 01:07:59,782
oop.

1355
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:00,950
Yeah, just... I don't know.

1356
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:02,285
Okay. I don't know.

1357
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:05,421
You almost had it. Look...
¶ from the shallows.

1358
01:08:05,889 --> 01:08:09,559
¶ I am stumblin' a... ¶

1359
01:08:09,561 --> 01:08:12,595
¶ lonely grave

1360
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:16,799
¶ lift me up

1361
01:08:17,734 --> 01:08:21,304
¶ from your shallows.

1362
01:08:21,872 --> 01:08:25,408
¶ I am destined to...

1363
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:29,212
¶ Live ashamed

1364
01:08:30,781 --> 01:08:31,847
got more clothes.

1365
01:08:31,849 --> 01:08:32,982
Got some clothes for ya.

1366
01:08:32,984 --> 01:08:33,950
Oh. Okay, wait.

1367
01:08:33,952 --> 01:08:35,818
Wait. Before you put them down.

1368
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,587
Right there.

1369
01:08:37,888 --> 01:08:39,488
Yeah. Just dump 'em.

1370
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:40,856
( Sighs )

1371
01:08:47,698 --> 01:08:49,899
It's a little big.

1372
01:08:52,302 --> 01:08:53,736
( Mutters )

1373
01:09:01,478 --> 01:09:05,815
¶ Oh, I been sold out
( Retching )

1374
01:09:06,817 --> 01:09:09,785
¶ By my best friend.

1375
01:09:10,654 --> 01:09:13,789
¶ I've been knocked down ¶

1376
01:09:13,791 --> 01:09:16,759
¶ and thrown away

1377
01:09:16,761 --> 01:09:17,593
( retching )

1378
01:09:17,595 --> 01:09:21,864
¶ Oh oh I've been sold out ¶

1379
01:09:22,699 --> 01:09:25,635
¶ and mistreated.

1380
01:09:25,902 --> 01:09:29,505
¶ I've ignited ¶

1381
01:09:29,507 --> 01:09:32,041
¶ a dying flame

1382
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:34,310
that looks good.

1383
01:09:34,312 --> 01:09:36,312
Ready? Okay.

1384
01:09:37,748 --> 01:09:40,016
You're my mannequin.

1385
01:09:40,917 --> 01:09:42,918
Okay. Fits really well...

1386
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,854
obviously
for a smaller person...

1387
01:09:44,856 --> 01:09:46,922
have a good day. You, too.

1388
01:09:46,924 --> 01:09:48,658
Peace out.

1389
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:49,759
Okay.

1390
01:09:49,761 --> 01:09:50,660
You know what?

1391
01:09:50,662 --> 01:09:51,627
( Indistinct chattering )

1392
01:09:51,629 --> 01:09:54,563
Have a good day.
Thank you very much.

1393
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:56,899
Let it go for seven bucks.

1394
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,701
What do you say?

1395
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:01,470
Ashley: Nicki!

1396
01:10:01,472 --> 01:10:02,038
Hey.

1397
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,839
You changed your mind.

1398
01:10:03,841 --> 01:10:05,941
Uh, we could really
use your help.

1399
01:10:05,943 --> 01:10:07,376
Yeah.
( Bill conversing indistinctly )

1400
01:10:07,378 --> 01:10:11,714
I'm just here to see what's
been keeping you so busy.

1401
01:10:12,582 --> 01:10:15,418
Or should I say "who"?

1402
01:10:15,952 --> 01:10:18,387
I'm so over
spending time at bars,

1403
01:10:18,389 --> 01:10:19,789
and I'm glad you are, too.

1404
01:10:19,791 --> 01:10:20,756
This is much more fun.

1405
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:22,325
Yeah, spare me the pep talk.

1406
01:10:22,327 --> 01:10:23,893
I know you.

1407
01:10:26,797 --> 01:10:28,898
Peace offering.

1408
01:10:35,505 --> 01:10:36,806
( Gagging )

1409
01:10:36,808 --> 01:10:37,973
( Whispers ) That's vodka.

1410
01:10:37,975 --> 01:10:40,810
Yeah, I know. It's your fave.
I don't do that anymore.

1411
01:10:40,812 --> 01:10:44,580
Look, neither you or my dad have
ever gone too long without a drink.

1412
01:10:44,582 --> 01:10:47,783
I never knew that you
thought I was like your dad.

1413
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:50,953
I'm sorry. I don't.

1414
01:10:51,355 --> 01:10:53,456
Look, it's been a bad week.

1415
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:54,123
W-what's going on?

1416
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:56,525
You've obviously
been too busy to care.

1417
01:10:56,527 --> 01:10:57,993
I care. You're my best friend!

1418
01:10:57,995 --> 01:11:00,830
But Nicki, I'm finally
doing something that I like.

1419
01:11:00,832 --> 01:11:02,431
( Stammers ) Do it with me.

1420
01:11:02,433 --> 01:11:03,966
I don't belong here.

1421
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:05,067
I don't belong anywhere.

1422
01:11:05,069 --> 01:11:07,570
That's not true.
I... I want you to meet someone.

1423
01:11:07,572 --> 01:11:10,773
You never used to argue
with me before.

1424
01:11:10,775 --> 01:11:12,575
Look, go back to your friends.

1425
01:11:12,577 --> 01:11:13,576
Like your biker buddy said,

1426
01:11:13,578 --> 01:11:16,078
I got a lot of heavy decisions
to make right now.

1427
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,980
I'll see you later.

1428
01:11:19,549 --> 01:11:20,883
( Sighs )

1429
01:11:20,885 --> 01:11:23,986
( Indistinct chattering )

1430
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,488
( Sighs )

1431
01:11:25,756 --> 01:11:29,058
You've met Ashley's
friend before?

1432
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:30,559
Maybe.

1433
01:11:30,861 --> 01:11:33,996
Look, it was over
three years ago.

1434
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:35,831
Ashley know about that?

1435
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:39,135
It's nobody else's
business but mine.

1436
01:11:39,137 --> 01:11:40,002
Bill!

1437
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:42,138
Can I have a word with you?

1438
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:43,639
All right.

1439
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:47,176
( No audible dialogue )

1440
01:11:52,149 --> 01:11:54,016
( Sighs )

1441
01:11:55,085 --> 01:11:56,185
All right.

1442
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:57,520
You okay. Come on.

1443
01:11:57,522 --> 01:11:59,555
It's okay.

1444
01:12:03,994 --> 01:12:05,628
( Grunts )

1445
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:07,797
It's all right.

1446
01:12:07,799 --> 01:12:08,798
It's all right.

1447
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:09,698
She'll be all right.

1448
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,734
She just shouldn't lift
anything with her condition.

1449
01:12:11,736 --> 01:12:15,604
Jason will never speak to me
if he thinks I've told anyone.

1450
01:12:15,606 --> 01:12:19,575
This isn't the sort of thing
you can hide for very long.

1451
01:12:19,577 --> 01:12:20,209
What, you're...

1452
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:22,578
you're having Jason's baby?

1453
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:23,212
What's you plans?

1454
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:26,515
I'll go to school
until Christmas break,

1455
01:12:26,517 --> 01:12:27,950
and then...

1456
01:12:27,952 --> 01:12:29,018
I don't know.

1457
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:33,856
It's not the most complete
set of plans I've ever heard.

1458
01:12:33,858 --> 01:12:35,191
It needs work.

1459
01:12:35,193 --> 01:12:36,225
What does Jason propose to do?

1460
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:40,463
I don't know. Okay, I know
Jason can be a real...

1461
01:12:40,465 --> 01:12:41,564
Weiner at times,

1462
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:44,533
but deep down,
he really does care.

1463
01:12:44,801 --> 01:12:48,003
I don't think he
wants either of us.

1464
01:12:48,005 --> 01:12:49,605
He's changed so much.

1465
01:12:49,607 --> 01:12:52,708
Man: Hey, could I
get some help over here?

1466
01:12:55,212 --> 01:12:57,746
How long are those people
gonna be in our yard?

1467
01:12:57,748 --> 01:12:59,548
Looks like a garage sale.

1468
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:00,916
( Bill chuckling )

1469
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:04,687
Oh, Sharon.
Baby, it is a garage sale.

1470
01:13:04,689 --> 01:13:06,789
Well it makes us look poor.

1471
01:13:06,791 --> 01:13:08,691
What is this all about?

1472
01:13:08,693 --> 01:13:10,192
( Sighs )
Seeing you selling off

1473
01:13:10,194 --> 01:13:12,161
all of Amanda's old things.

1474
01:13:12,163 --> 01:13:14,063
It's just... I...

1475
01:13:14,264 --> 01:13:17,967
I didn't think you'd
mind if we sold them.

1476
01:13:19,169 --> 01:13:22,571
( Sighs ) Oh, baby.

1477
01:13:23,807 --> 01:13:25,841
So nice to see you
and Ashley getting along

1478
01:13:25,843 --> 01:13:28,577
since she's been doing the play.
( Chuckles )

1479
01:13:28,579 --> 01:13:32,748
You must be very proud that she's
doing something creative, huh?

1480
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:33,516
I am.

1481
01:13:33,518 --> 01:13:36,185
She's certainly
home a lot more.

1482
01:13:36,187 --> 01:13:36,952
Mm-hmm.

1483
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:39,922
I just wish Jason were.

1484
01:13:40,257 --> 01:13:41,090
And I wish I knew

1485
01:13:41,092 --> 01:13:43,592
why our things
keep disappearing.

1486
01:13:43,594 --> 01:13:46,095
My jewelry,
money from our wallets.

1487
01:13:46,097 --> 01:13:48,564
And now my mother's silver.

1488
01:13:48,566 --> 01:13:49,765
Yeah.

1489
01:13:49,767 --> 01:13:51,300
Oh, baby.

1490
01:13:51,302 --> 01:13:53,536
( Groans )

1491
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:57,940
Has it ever occurred to you
that it might be Jason?

1492
01:13:57,942 --> 01:14:01,911
He's lost a lot of weight.
He does not look good.

1493
01:14:03,179 --> 01:14:04,046
Bill, I'm tired.

1494
01:14:04,048 --> 01:14:06,549
Could you just get rid
of those people soon?

1495
01:14:06,551 --> 01:14:08,918
You betcha. Thanks.

1496
01:14:12,022 --> 01:14:13,222
Hey, Mac. Hey.

1497
01:14:13,224 --> 01:14:14,223
Let's wrap this up, huh?

1498
01:14:14,225 --> 01:14:17,026
You got it.
Been a long day, huh?

1499
01:14:17,028 --> 01:14:17,726
Yes, sir.

1500
01:14:17,728 --> 01:14:20,996
We did really well... so, we
have a few more things to sell.

1501
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:22,765
( Sighs )

1502
01:14:22,767 --> 01:14:23,966
Show some mercy!

1503
01:14:23,968 --> 01:14:24,867
I'm beat.

1504
01:14:24,869 --> 01:14:26,602
We've made 247

1505
01:14:26,604 --> 01:14:27,169
and 63 cents.

1506
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:30,172
That means we have enough
to buy the rest of the supplies

1507
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:32,207
and pay me something.

1508
01:14:32,776 --> 01:14:34,009
Maybe a little left over

1509
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:36,879
for some paint and canvas?

1510
01:14:36,881 --> 01:14:38,914
Ashley: You're just in it
for the paint.

1511
01:14:38,916 --> 01:14:39,915
Yeah... and just for that,

1512
01:14:39,917 --> 01:14:43,652
I am not letting you take me
to pizza tonight. ( Chuckles )

1513
01:14:43,654 --> 01:14:47,222
Um, actually,
can I take a rain check?

1514
01:14:47,224 --> 01:14:50,125
Something sorta came up.

1515
01:14:50,127 --> 01:14:51,894
What?

1516
01:14:52,062 --> 01:14:54,363
Just some personal stuff.

1517
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:55,631
Okay. ( Scoffs )

1518
01:14:55,633 --> 01:14:57,766
Don't let me interfere, then.

1519
01:14:57,768 --> 01:14:59,201
Don't be that way.

1520
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:00,603
Here, just take the keys

1521
01:15:00,605 --> 01:15:01,971
and get all the rest
of this... to shelter,

1522
01:15:01,973 --> 01:15:05,674
and I'll come by
and pick it up later, okay?

1523
01:15:08,745 --> 01:15:10,346
See you later.

1524
01:15:10,348 --> 01:15:11,814
Bye.

1525
01:15:13,984 --> 01:15:14,817
You know what?

1526
01:15:14,819 --> 01:15:16,752
Let's just do the shelter thing
another day.

1527
01:15:16,754 --> 01:15:18,654
You take the truck,
get some rest,

1528
01:15:18,656 --> 01:15:20,823
go home, and...
I'll call you later.

1529
01:15:20,825 --> 01:15:24,026
Uh... Ashley! Tell me you
are not going to follow him.

1530
01:15:24,028 --> 01:15:27,096
Don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.

1531
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:39,808
I heard coach let you go.

1532
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:41,243
Sorry, buddy.

1533
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:44,113
Yeah, well you
could've covered for me.

1534
01:15:44,115 --> 01:15:45,381
I've been sick.

1535
01:15:45,383 --> 01:15:46,382
I tried to cover.

1536
01:15:46,384 --> 01:15:47,349
He didn't buy it.

1537
01:15:47,351 --> 01:15:50,386
Everybody knows you
got a problem.

1538
01:15:50,388 --> 01:15:52,688
( Grunting )

1539
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:54,657
Hey. You're my friend!

1540
01:15:54,659 --> 01:15:56,759
But you're whacked out, man.

1541
01:15:56,761 --> 01:15:58,093
You need help.

1542
01:15:58,095 --> 01:16:00,129
Screw you.

1543
01:16:04,034 --> 01:16:05,768
( Bell dinging )

1544
01:16:09,706 --> 01:16:10,706
Hey.

1545
01:16:10,708 --> 01:16:12,675
Hi.

1546
01:16:13,243 --> 01:16:13,976
Nice shirt.

1547
01:16:13,978 --> 01:16:17,312
Had these made for everyone
in the play.

1548
01:16:17,881 --> 01:16:18,814
Long time, no see.

1549
01:16:18,816 --> 01:16:20,749
I didn't think you'd
even remember me.

1550
01:16:20,751 --> 01:16:23,686
I mean, it's been
over three years.

1551
01:16:23,688 --> 01:16:25,387
And that was a pretty
wild night.

1552
01:16:25,389 --> 01:16:28,323
And now you're
dating my best friend.

1553
01:16:28,325 --> 01:16:29,324
( Chuckles )

1554
01:16:29,326 --> 01:16:30,859
Small world.

1555
01:16:30,861 --> 01:16:32,695
Yeah. Thing is,

1556
01:16:32,697 --> 01:16:35,397
I didn't even know you two
knew each other.

1557
01:16:35,399 --> 01:16:37,933
Is that a problem for you?

1558
01:16:38,068 --> 01:16:41,336
Well, I mean, Ashley's just
been so busy with the play,

1559
01:16:41,338 --> 01:16:45,340
and she's just beginning
to have confidence in herself,

1560
01:16:45,342 --> 01:16:47,476
and... And you?

1561
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:48,777
And me?

1562
01:16:48,779 --> 01:16:49,945
And, well...

1563
01:16:49,947 --> 01:16:52,047
That subject just
hasn't come up yet.

1564
01:16:52,049 --> 01:16:55,117
You know me.
I'm not gonna say anything.

1565
01:16:55,119 --> 01:16:55,818
But...

1566
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:59,088
She's bound to find out
sooner or later.

1567
01:16:59,090 --> 01:17:01,123
Later would be better.

1568
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:03,959
I'd just rather
tell her myself.

1569
01:17:03,961 --> 01:17:06,295
So this a real thing?

1570
01:17:06,297 --> 01:17:07,896
( Chuckles )

1571
01:17:08,364 --> 01:17:12,101
Looks like you've been taking
pretty good care of yourself.

1572
01:17:12,103 --> 01:17:14,136
Had to.

1573
01:17:14,138 --> 01:17:15,838
Yeah.

1574
01:17:16,339 --> 01:17:19,007
You had to do it alone.

1575
01:17:19,776 --> 01:17:23,912
I just couldn't handle
any relationships at the time.

1576
01:17:23,914 --> 01:17:26,749
But... I'm here for you now.

1577
01:17:27,417 --> 01:17:31,820
Don't make any promises
you can't keep.

1578
01:17:34,424 --> 01:17:37,092
This is where I'm staying.

1579
01:17:40,096 --> 01:17:41,430
Nobody knows but Mac.

1580
01:17:41,432 --> 01:17:44,032
You're pretty great, Nicole.

1581
01:17:46,169 --> 01:17:47,136
What's the matter, Nick?

1582
01:17:47,138 --> 01:17:49,938
Ken and the bar boys
not enough action for you?

1583
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:51,340
You have to steal my boyfriend?

1584
01:17:51,342 --> 01:17:53,275
( Chuckling )
This is too funny.

1585
01:17:53,277 --> 01:17:55,444
I know what this
must look like,

1586
01:17:55,446 --> 01:17:56,812
but it's...

1587
01:17:56,814 --> 01:17:58,413
( laughing )

1588
01:17:58,415 --> 01:18:00,149
I'm laughing.

1589
01:18:00,151 --> 01:18:01,316
Jonathan: Wha...

1590
01:18:01,318 --> 01:18:02,217
( grunts )

1591
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:03,485
Have a little faith in me.

1592
01:18:03,487 --> 01:18:06,789
I do. Very little.

1593
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:09,224
Wanna reconsider that promise?

1594
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,960
¶ If I knew now

1595
01:18:11,962 --> 01:18:14,797
¶ what I knew then

1596
01:18:14,799 --> 01:18:19,101
¶ if I hadn't forgotten ¶

1597
01:18:19,103 --> 01:18:20,936
¶ what we meant

1598
01:18:20,938 --> 01:18:24,039
¶ if I held on

1599
01:18:24,041 --> 01:18:27,109
¶ though the hard times

1600
01:18:27,111 --> 01:18:30,813
¶ if I'd done what I needed ¶

1601
01:18:30,815 --> 01:18:33,482
¶ to make things right.

1602
01:18:33,484 --> 01:18:36,118
¶ I'd know love ¶

1603
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,554
¶ before I lost it

1604
01:18:38,556 --> 01:18:41,456
¶ if I hadn't forgotten ¶

1605
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:44,293
what are you doing in my room?

1606
01:18:44,295 --> 01:18:47,095
"Sharon's had it so tough.

1607
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:51,967
I'm going to take care
of Jason until she's ready."

1608
01:18:55,505 --> 01:19:00,542
Your mother never really
loved the band like I did.

1609
01:19:02,946 --> 01:19:05,848
But she loved me and bill.

1610
01:19:05,982 --> 01:19:09,585
We thought we were
doing what she wanted.

1611
01:19:09,587 --> 01:19:12,254
What are you talking about?

1612
01:19:15,491 --> 01:19:18,260
You're a lot like her.

1613
01:19:18,995 --> 01:19:22,431
You're both so pretty.

1614
01:19:23,099 --> 01:19:25,267
Are you okay?

1615
01:19:25,501 --> 01:19:29,104
I watched you
sell Amanda's things.

1616
01:19:29,239 --> 01:19:32,140
Have you been stealing my things
and selling them, too?

1617
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:34,509
Honestly, Sharon, I haven't.

1618
01:19:34,511 --> 01:19:36,879
No... why would I?

1619
01:19:38,915 --> 01:19:39,615
( Sighs )

1620
01:19:39,617 --> 01:19:41,884
I don't know how
to be a good mother.

1621
01:19:41,886 --> 01:19:43,585
You're starting
to freak me out.

1622
01:19:43,587 --> 01:19:47,990
Why doesn't my son like me?

1623
01:19:48,191 --> 01:19:50,225
I'm gonna go get daddy.

1624
01:19:50,227 --> 01:19:52,327
I've pushed bill away.

1625
01:19:53,196 --> 01:19:56,064
Is he gonna leave me, too?

1626
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:00,168
( Sighs ) Why don't you just...

1627
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,904
Give me the diary?

1628
01:20:01,906 --> 01:20:02,905
No!

1629
01:20:02,907 --> 01:20:04,106
No, no.

1630
01:20:04,108 --> 01:20:06,008
Sharon!

1631
01:20:07,243 --> 01:20:09,978
What is going on?

1632
01:20:11,347 --> 01:20:12,948
( Sighs )

1633
01:20:13,349 --> 01:20:15,984
Hey, sorry to come by so late.

1634
01:20:15,986 --> 01:20:17,119
Your mom's not home, right?

1635
01:20:17,121 --> 01:20:19,421
No, night shift again.
What's wrong?

1636
01:20:19,423 --> 01:20:21,189
Everything. Just take this...

1637
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:22,958
most of it's yours, anyway.

1638
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,127
Okay, well, come in.

1639
01:20:28,264 --> 01:20:30,165
Well, where's Jonathan?

1640
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:32,334
With my ex-best friend.

1641
01:20:32,336 --> 01:20:35,470
And Sharon's freaking out
about something.

1642
01:20:35,472 --> 01:20:37,306
I don't know.

1643
01:20:37,674 --> 01:20:39,942
Will you help me with this?

1644
01:20:39,944 --> 01:20:41,443
Yeah.

1645
01:20:42,478 --> 01:20:43,211
( Sighs )

1646
01:20:43,213 --> 01:20:46,381
Men are pond scum. ( Chuckles )

1647
01:20:47,116 --> 01:20:49,084
But... What are you gonna do?

1648
01:20:49,086 --> 01:20:52,454
( Sighs )
Honestly, I have no idea.

1649
01:20:52,456 --> 01:20:54,122
But I've talked to God
about it,

1650
01:20:54,124 --> 01:20:57,159
and I know that
he's forgiven me,

1651
01:20:57,161 --> 01:20:58,193
which is definitely

1652
01:20:58,195 --> 01:21:01,563
more than I can
say for my mom at the moment.

1653
01:21:02,031 --> 01:21:04,166
So you talk to God directly?

1654
01:21:04,168 --> 01:21:05,968
Of course. Don't you?

1655
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:08,470
Oh, yeah, all the time.

1656
01:21:09,305 --> 01:21:10,105
( Sighs )

1657
01:21:10,107 --> 01:21:13,542
All I know is Jason
needs to get off the drugs.

1658
01:21:13,544 --> 01:21:15,577
Himself.

1659
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:18,146
He has to decide.

1660
01:21:18,148 --> 01:21:19,281
Have you decided

1661
01:21:19,283 --> 01:21:22,217
if you're gonna
keep the baby, or...

1662
01:21:22,219 --> 01:21:23,418
Go to school?

1663
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:23,986
Both.

1664
01:21:23,988 --> 01:21:28,156
You can't be anything
if you haven't finished school.

1665
01:21:28,291 --> 01:21:30,625
W-what are you gonna
do when the baby comes?

1666
01:21:30,627 --> 01:21:33,195
Well my mom won't kick me out,

1667
01:21:33,197 --> 01:21:34,129
and since she works nights,

1668
01:21:34,131 --> 01:21:36,498
she'll be able to watch
the baby during the day.

1669
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:39,768
I'm gonna try to work
for a store doing alterations

1670
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:41,103
so I can be with her at night.

1671
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:42,671
I see you've
decided it's a girl.

1672
01:21:42,673 --> 01:21:44,706
( Chuckles )
Have you named her yet?

1673
01:21:44,708 --> 01:21:46,508
Shut up. ( Chuckles )

1674
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:47,542
( Knocking on door )

1675
01:21:47,544 --> 01:21:50,345
I'm popular tonight. ( Sighs )

1676
01:21:53,116 --> 01:21:55,083
You must be the angel.

1677
01:21:55,085 --> 01:21:56,218
I'm a friend of jazz.

1678
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:59,688
I know who you are,
and you're not welcome here.

1679
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:02,057
Who are you?! Leave her alone!

1680
01:22:02,059 --> 01:22:05,527
( Phone ringing )

1681
01:22:08,564 --> 01:22:11,033
Angelina's mom
has already called the cops.

1682
01:22:11,035 --> 01:22:13,635
Your brother's an idiot.

1683
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:15,203
Geo: I'm not.

1684
01:22:15,205 --> 01:22:16,238
Whore's mom works nights.

1685
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:19,307
That's when he gets
his free piece of ass.

1686
01:22:19,309 --> 01:22:20,675
Ain't that right?

1687
01:22:20,677 --> 01:22:22,711
( Breathing heavily )

1688
01:22:30,453 --> 01:22:31,553
Jazz...

1689
01:22:31,555 --> 01:22:34,222
Is a very disappointing boy.

1690
01:22:35,758 --> 01:22:39,795
But... You already knew that,
didn't you?

1691
01:22:40,396 --> 01:22:42,431
Jason's too good for you.

1692
01:22:45,535 --> 01:22:47,402
( Gasping )

1693
01:22:47,404 --> 01:22:48,804
( Grunts )

1694
01:22:52,141 --> 01:22:54,276
Let her go, geo.

1695
01:22:54,278 --> 01:22:55,077
( Whimpering )

1696
01:22:55,079 --> 01:22:57,312
Everybody's here.

1697
01:22:57,314 --> 01:22:58,213
Nice.

1698
01:22:58,215 --> 01:22:59,815
I said, "let her go"!

1699
01:23:00,416 --> 01:23:02,284
( Whimpering )

1700
01:23:02,286 --> 01:23:04,386
( Groaning )

1701
01:23:14,764 --> 01:23:16,731
The money, jazz!

1702
01:23:17,266 --> 01:23:19,267
I don't have it.

1703
01:23:19,269 --> 01:23:20,802
Search him.

1704
01:23:23,706 --> 01:23:25,340
( Grunting )

1705
01:23:25,675 --> 01:23:27,776
I don't have it!

1706
01:23:31,747 --> 01:23:33,548
Girl: What?!

1707
01:23:39,522 --> 01:23:41,223
( Choking ) Nothin'.

1708
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:43,792
Then this is our lucky night.

1709
01:23:45,528 --> 01:23:47,395
( Angelina gasps )

1710
01:23:47,397 --> 01:23:49,664
( Whimpering )

1711
01:23:49,666 --> 01:23:51,600
( Clothing rips )

1712
01:23:54,504 --> 01:23:55,804
Bitch!

1713
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:02,811
( Grunts )

1714
01:24:04,147 --> 01:24:05,647
( Yells )

1715
01:24:07,316 --> 01:24:08,917
( Gun cocks )

1716
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:12,687
We're gonna try this again.

1717
01:24:12,689 --> 01:24:15,423
This time
I want a better answer.

1718
01:24:15,691 --> 01:24:18,326
The money is where?

1719
01:24:19,195 --> 01:24:20,795
( Grunting )

1720
01:24:20,797 --> 01:24:22,497
It's outside.

1721
01:24:23,166 --> 01:24:25,200
Under the doormat.

1722
01:24:25,202 --> 01:24:26,701
( Yelps )

1723
01:24:29,172 --> 01:24:31,706
I-I brought it...

1724
01:24:31,708 --> 01:24:33,441
For the baby.

1725
01:24:35,611 --> 01:24:36,278
Money.

1726
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,647
You give that back! ( Groans )

1727
01:24:42,285 --> 01:24:43,585
Money.

1728
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:55,664
Geo: Easy.

1729
01:24:55,666 --> 01:24:57,432
You're okay.

1730
01:25:00,236 --> 01:25:01,803
( Groans )

1731
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:03,538
( Yells )

1732
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:05,340
Just chill.

1733
01:25:05,342 --> 01:25:07,242
( Gasping )

1734
01:25:20,323 --> 01:25:21,957
( Groans )

1735
01:25:24,393 --> 01:25:27,596
( Sobbing )

1736
01:25:29,365 --> 01:25:31,399
( Cries )

1737
01:25:32,668 --> 01:25:34,469
Ah! ( Sobbing )

1738
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,908
The lord is my Shepherd.

1739
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:41,643
I shall not want.

1740
01:25:41,645 --> 01:25:45,447
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

1741
01:25:46,315 --> 01:25:47,349
Oh...

1742
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:50,652
He leadeth me
beside still waters.

1743
01:25:50,654 --> 01:25:51,453
He restores my soul.

1744
01:25:51,455 --> 01:25:53,388
Shut up with that religious shit.
Yea, though I walk

1745
01:25:53,390 --> 01:25:55,323
though the valley of the shadow of death...
Geo: Get the money.

1746
01:25:55,325 --> 01:25:58,994
I will fear no evil, for you are...
( Sobbing ) Where's the money?

1747
01:25:58,996 --> 01:26:00,395
( Gasps )

1748
01:26:00,397 --> 01:26:01,329
No.

1749
01:26:01,331 --> 01:26:01,831
( Yells )

1750
01:26:01,832 --> 01:26:04,366
Angelina:
Thy rod and thy staff,

1751
01:26:04,368 --> 01:26:06,801
they comfort me. ( Sobbing )

1752
01:26:07,737 --> 01:26:09,304
O lord, please!

1753
01:26:09,306 --> 01:26:10,839
( Cries ) ( Grunts )

1754
01:26:10,841 --> 01:26:14,009
( Geo screaming )

1755
01:26:14,011 --> 01:26:14,943
( Angelina praying )

1756
01:26:14,945 --> 01:26:17,512
Angelina: Though the valley
of the shadow of death.

1757
01:26:17,514 --> 01:26:20,682
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

1758
01:26:20,684 --> 01:26:23,652
You prepareth a table
in the presence of my enemies.

1759
01:26:23,654 --> 01:26:24,319
Stop!!!

1760
01:26:24,321 --> 01:26:26,354
He anointeth my head with oil.

1761
01:26:26,356 --> 01:26:28,523
Get geo. Let's get out of here.

1762
01:26:28,525 --> 01:26:29,357
Surely goodness and...

1763
01:26:29,359 --> 01:26:32,494
and mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life.

1764
01:26:32,496 --> 01:26:33,795
Take it easy.

1765
01:26:33,797 --> 01:26:35,463
You don't wanna hurt anybody.

1766
01:26:35,465 --> 01:26:36,998
( Siren blaring )

1767
01:26:45,441 --> 01:26:47,609
That everything?

1768
01:26:48,644 --> 01:26:50,045
Pretty much.

1769
01:26:50,047 --> 01:26:51,846
Okay.

1770
01:26:51,848 --> 01:26:53,315
Then, um,

1771
01:26:53,317 --> 01:26:54,516
we're done with you for now.

1772
01:26:54,518 --> 01:26:58,019
In the morning, I'll need you
to come down, and, uh,

1773
01:26:58,021 --> 01:26:59,788
identify the accused.

1774
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:00,455
Officer,

1775
01:27:00,457 --> 01:27:02,824
do you think we could
have our costume money back?

1776
01:27:02,826 --> 01:27:04,492
The play is only
a few days away.

1777
01:27:04,494 --> 01:27:06,695
Mmm, right now,
it's still evidence

1778
01:27:06,697 --> 01:27:08,596
confiscated at the scene
of the crime.

1779
01:27:08,598 --> 01:27:10,632
I have to have that money.

1780
01:27:10,634 --> 01:27:12,100
Those kids are counting on me.

1781
01:27:12,102 --> 01:27:12,967
I-I gave them my word.

1782
01:27:12,969 --> 01:27:17,105
I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.

1783
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:23,645
So what made you come tonight?

1784
01:27:23,979 --> 01:27:24,780
I needed to see you.

1785
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:28,817
But when you weren't home, I
figured you were at Angelina's.

1786
01:27:28,819 --> 01:27:31,453
After your date with Nicole?

1787
01:27:31,455 --> 01:27:32,354
It wasn't a date.

1788
01:27:32,356 --> 01:27:35,990
I mean, I wish you would
just listen to me so I could...

1789
01:27:38,361 --> 01:27:40,095
( Jason screaming )

1790
01:27:40,097 --> 01:27:40,795
Let me go!

1791
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:44,032
Give him the sedative now.
Let me go! Let me go!

1792
01:27:44,034 --> 01:27:46,801
Jason: <i>Let me go!</i>

1793
01:27:47,703 --> 01:27:49,637
Is Jason gonna be all right?

1794
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:52,073
The gunshot wounds
were superficial.

1795
01:27:52,075 --> 01:27:53,375
He had so many drugs
in his system

1796
01:27:53,377 --> 01:27:56,811
that he's actually doing better
now with the transfusions

1797
01:27:56,813 --> 01:27:57,879
we've given him.

1798
01:27:57,881 --> 01:27:58,913
Can you help him?

1799
01:27:58,915 --> 01:28:00,548
I mean, with the addiction?

1800
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:03,051
We can monitor and assist
with withdrawal now.

1801
01:28:03,053 --> 01:28:05,987
But ultimately,
whether he stays clean,

1802
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:07,689
it's up to him. Right.

1803
01:28:07,691 --> 01:28:09,557
H-how soon can he come home?

1804
01:28:09,559 --> 01:28:10,658
He could go to jail.

1805
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:11,960
But I am recommending

1806
01:28:11,962 --> 01:28:14,963
that he sign himself
into a rehab center.

1807
01:28:14,965 --> 01:28:16,097
Oh, thank you so much.

1808
01:28:16,099 --> 01:28:17,699
No, Jason... Jason... oh.

1809
01:28:17,701 --> 01:28:18,933
Is not going to jail.

1810
01:28:18,935 --> 01:28:20,168
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1811
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:22,704
That's <i>our</i> son
lying back there.

1812
01:28:22,706 --> 01:28:27,175
And that's <i>our</i> daughter
that almost got shot.

1813
01:28:28,544 --> 01:28:29,477
God!

1814
01:28:29,479 --> 01:28:31,846
Oh, my God. Oh, baby.

1815
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:34,749
Oh, God. ( Sobbing )

1816
01:28:35,718 --> 01:28:37,819
Sharon.

1817
01:28:37,821 --> 01:28:40,121
( Sobbing )

1818
01:28:40,489 --> 01:28:44,025
I haven't always
done what's right in the past.

1819
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:45,827
I know that. But...

1820
01:28:45,829 --> 01:28:46,461
bill!

1821
01:28:46,463 --> 01:28:49,164
Our whole world
is falling apart.

1822
01:28:49,166 --> 01:28:49,931
Let me finish.

1823
01:28:49,933 --> 01:28:53,134
What I want to tell you, baby...

1824
01:28:54,136 --> 01:28:55,737
( sighs )

1825
01:28:55,739 --> 01:28:57,839
( Crying )

1826
01:28:57,841 --> 01:28:59,908
Nothing in our lives

1827
01:28:59,910 --> 01:29:02,043
has worked out
the way we wanted.

1828
01:29:02,045 --> 01:29:05,046
But believe it or not,
baby, I love you,

1829
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:07,215
( whispers ) And I want
our family to work.

1830
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:10,919
It's up to us
to work things out.

1831
01:29:11,687 --> 01:29:13,788
Look at me.

1832
01:29:16,492 --> 01:29:18,026
( Sighs )

1833
01:29:19,495 --> 01:29:21,996
( Sobbing ) Oh, oh, come here.

1834
01:29:21,998 --> 01:29:23,131
Come here, baby.

1835
01:29:23,133 --> 01:29:26,000
( Sobbing ) My girl.

1836
01:29:26,002 --> 01:29:28,002
Who's my girl?

1837
01:29:28,004 --> 01:29:28,636
I am.

1838
01:29:28,638 --> 01:29:32,707
I really enjoyed practicing
with you the other day.

1839
01:29:32,709 --> 01:29:33,842
( Chuckles )

1840
01:29:33,844 --> 01:29:34,909
Me too.

1841
01:29:34,911 --> 01:29:37,512
More than you know.

1842
01:29:40,149 --> 01:29:41,950
( Sighs )

1843
01:29:42,151 --> 01:29:43,551
( Whispers ) I love you.

1844
01:29:43,553 --> 01:29:44,953
I love you, too.

1845
01:29:44,955 --> 01:29:46,254
( Gasps )

1846
01:29:46,256 --> 01:29:47,589
I'm caught.

1847
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:48,723
I'm caught. Stand still.

1848
01:29:48,725 --> 01:29:50,592
Stand still.
You're making it worse.

1849
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:51,726
Stand still.
Get it loose, bill!

1850
01:29:51,728 --> 01:29:53,628
Baby, you're gonna make it...
get it loose!

1851
01:29:53,630 --> 01:29:56,764
Why'd you come
get me anyway, huh?

1852
01:29:56,766 --> 01:30:01,603
Friends don't let friends
drive drunk.

1853
01:30:06,141 --> 01:30:09,611
Sharon: You can be a real
pain in the butt sometimes.

1854
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:11,980
But I love you, girl.
( Groans )

1855
01:30:11,982 --> 01:30:14,983
I love you... ( Mutters )
Okay, Sharon...

1856
01:30:14,985 --> 01:30:17,719
oh, oh, it's caught!
( Yelling )

1857
01:30:17,721 --> 01:30:18,219
Wait, Sharon...

1858
01:30:18,221 --> 01:30:21,022
Sharon: Amanda, look out!
( Horn honking )

1859
01:30:21,024 --> 01:30:23,024
( Screaming )

1860
01:30:23,026 --> 01:30:24,592
Calm down.

1861
01:30:24,594 --> 01:30:25,894
I'm here.

1862
01:30:25,896 --> 01:30:27,128
( Sobbing ) Oh, baby.

1863
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:28,663
What is the matter?

1864
01:30:28,665 --> 01:30:30,598
( Sobbing )

1865
01:30:31,166 --> 01:30:32,834
( Whispers )
What is the matter?

1866
01:30:32,836 --> 01:30:36,004
I was just trying to hug her.

1867
01:30:36,006 --> 01:30:37,138
( Sniffles )

1868
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,741
All my fault.

1869
01:30:40,976 --> 01:30:44,212
It was all my fault. No.

1870
01:30:49,552 --> 01:30:51,853
It was an accident.

1871
01:30:53,289 --> 01:30:54,856
I forgive you.

1872
01:30:54,858 --> 01:30:58,993
You've got to forgive yourself.
( Whimpers )

1873
01:30:59,695 --> 01:31:00,628
Okay?

1874
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:02,931
I can't.

1875
01:31:02,933 --> 01:31:04,899
I loved her so much.

1876
01:31:04,901 --> 01:31:06,234
Oh, baby.

1877
01:31:06,236 --> 01:31:08,736
We both did.

1878
01:31:09,305 --> 01:31:12,273
But that was another life.

1879
01:31:13,175 --> 01:31:16,578
You're not leaving? Now?

1880
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:18,212
What about me?

1881
01:31:19,214 --> 01:31:21,082
You're off to a good start.

1882
01:31:21,084 --> 01:31:22,650
I lost the money for the play,

1883
01:31:22,652 --> 01:31:25,587
my best friend and my boyfriend
are cheating on me,

1884
01:31:25,589 --> 01:31:27,789
and Angelina and Jason
are in the hospital.

1885
01:31:27,791 --> 01:31:30,825
( Chuckles )
And now you're leaving.

1886
01:31:39,335 --> 01:31:41,235
See you at the shelter.

1887
01:31:41,237 --> 01:31:43,004
Won't be the same.

1888
01:31:43,006 --> 01:31:43,805
Nothing ever is.

1889
01:31:43,807 --> 01:31:47,809
But you've got 17 kids
counting on you.

1890
01:31:48,677 --> 01:31:49,177
( Sighs )

1891
01:31:49,179 --> 01:31:51,312
I'm gonna go
see Angelina right now.

1892
01:31:51,314 --> 01:31:54,349
I'll catch up with you later.

1893
01:31:54,351 --> 01:31:55,617
Mac?

1894
01:31:55,619 --> 01:31:58,086
Will you check on Jason for me?

1895
01:31:58,088 --> 01:32:01,055
Um, make sure that he's okay?

1896
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:02,023
If he needs anything.

1897
01:32:02,025 --> 01:32:04,125
I'll do better than that.

1898
01:32:04,127 --> 01:32:05,827
( Chuckles )

1899
01:32:26,081 --> 01:32:29,150
You think visiting hours
apply to chairs?

1900
01:32:29,152 --> 01:32:30,284
Where'd you get that?

1901
01:32:30,286 --> 01:32:33,721
From your friends
down at the shop.

1902
01:32:34,923 --> 01:32:35,990
It's a piece of trash.

1903
01:32:35,992 --> 01:32:39,060
No. Like you,
it's a real piece of work.

1904
01:32:39,062 --> 01:32:41,996
And, like you,
it's just not finished yet.

1905
01:32:41,998 --> 01:32:46,834
Although, it looks considerably
better than you at the moment.

1906
01:32:46,969 --> 01:32:49,270
You think they'll
let me work on it?

1907
01:32:49,272 --> 01:32:50,838
At the rehab center?

1908
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:51,739
Sure. They're...

1909
01:32:51,741 --> 01:32:55,176
Bound to need better chairs
down there.

1910
01:32:55,178 --> 01:32:56,210
So what's next?

1911
01:32:56,212 --> 01:32:58,079
None of your business.

1912
01:32:58,081 --> 01:32:59,447
Who are you, anyway?

1913
01:32:59,449 --> 01:33:02,183
A friend of Angelina's.

1914
01:33:02,851 --> 01:33:03,718
How is she?

1915
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:05,319
Nobody tells me anything
around here.

1916
01:33:05,321 --> 01:33:07,255
They treat me like a criminal.

1917
01:33:07,257 --> 01:33:08,690
( Chuckles )

1918
01:33:08,692 --> 01:33:10,124
What's so funny?

1919
01:33:10,126 --> 01:33:11,826
You <i>are</i> a criminal.

1920
01:33:11,828 --> 01:33:13,161
I did it for angel.

1921
01:33:13,163 --> 01:33:15,730
So she could keep the baby.

1922
01:33:15,732 --> 01:33:18,032
They didn't tell you?

1923
01:33:20,269 --> 01:33:22,870
She lost the baby.

1924
01:33:23,205 --> 01:33:25,973
She said you didn't want it.

1925
01:33:30,279 --> 01:33:33,181
Look, uh...

1926
01:33:33,183 --> 01:33:35,483
Thanks for the rocker.

1927
01:33:35,485 --> 01:33:36,217
( Sighs )

1928
01:33:36,219 --> 01:33:39,487
Just, please...
just leave me alone.

1929
01:33:39,489 --> 01:33:41,089
This is between angel and me.

1930
01:33:41,091 --> 01:33:42,724
We'll work it out.

1931
01:33:42,726 --> 01:33:44,392
Maybe.

1932
01:33:45,027 --> 01:33:46,227
Maybe not.

1933
01:33:46,229 --> 01:33:49,097
She hasn't
regained consciousness yet.

1934
01:33:49,099 --> 01:33:53,201
The doctors don't
expect her to make it.

1935
01:33:56,071 --> 01:33:57,004
( Sighs )

1936
01:33:57,006 --> 01:33:58,406
Please! Wait, wait, wait.

1937
01:33:58,408 --> 01:33:59,307
Wait.

1938
01:33:59,309 --> 01:34:01,209
Just please...

1939
01:34:01,211 --> 01:34:02,310
Just help me.

1940
01:34:02,312 --> 01:34:03,344
Help you do what?

1941
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:04,812
Just gotta see angel.

1942
01:34:04,814 --> 01:34:06,848
And please just
talk to somebody.

1943
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:07,882
If you're really her friend,

1944
01:34:07,884 --> 01:34:09,217
you know she'll want me
to be there.

1945
01:34:09,219 --> 01:34:11,786
She's all alone.
Just please let me see her.

1946
01:34:11,788 --> 01:34:15,022
She doesn't
need your guilt right now.

1947
01:34:15,024 --> 01:34:16,824
She needs your love,

1948
01:34:16,826 --> 01:34:19,127
your faith,

1949
01:34:19,129 --> 01:34:21,295
and your prayers.

1950
01:34:21,297 --> 01:34:22,830
Look...

1951
01:34:22,832 --> 01:34:27,502
I know that I am not
worth her little finger...

1952
01:34:27,836 --> 01:34:32,106
But she's the only person
that I really loved.

1953
01:34:32,975 --> 01:34:34,308
( Gasps )

1954
01:34:34,310 --> 01:34:36,944
She always wanted me
to say that to her,

1955
01:34:36,946 --> 01:34:38,446
but I never did.

1956
01:34:38,448 --> 01:34:41,015
I'll see what I can do.

1957
01:34:44,319 --> 01:34:49,090
You know you can make a difference
if you're willing to change.

1958
01:34:49,092 --> 01:34:53,494
The greatest man in the universe
was a simple carpenter.

1959
01:34:54,196 --> 01:34:56,230
And his life...

1960
01:34:56,232 --> 01:34:59,100
Changed this planet.

1961
01:35:04,173 --> 01:35:05,540
( Sighs )

1962
01:35:10,512 --> 01:35:12,380
( Door shuts )

1963
01:35:13,015 --> 01:35:15,483
Another volunteer.

1964
01:35:17,486 --> 01:35:18,386
( Sighs )

1965
01:35:18,388 --> 01:35:20,454
Hi, I'm Nicki.

1966
01:35:20,456 --> 01:35:22,056
Watch the sticky fingers.

1967
01:35:22,058 --> 01:35:24,192
I got a heavy date tonight.

1968
01:35:24,393 --> 01:35:27,295
What is this <i>sack</i>
you are wearing?

1969
01:35:27,297 --> 01:35:29,397
I'm Mary, the virgin.

1970
01:35:29,399 --> 01:35:31,299
And this is my costume.

1971
01:35:31,301 --> 01:35:32,099
Well, no wonder.

1972
01:35:32,101 --> 01:35:34,569
You're never gonna
get a guy looking like that.

1973
01:35:34,571 --> 01:35:38,840
Hey, makeovers are what I do.

1974
01:35:39,408 --> 01:35:41,075
Come on.

1975
01:35:43,579 --> 01:35:45,146
( Sighs )

1976
01:35:45,380 --> 01:35:48,916
I'd prefer you
didn't bring her here.

1977
01:35:49,384 --> 01:35:54,155
Has anyone ever told you how
extremely irritating you can be?

1978
01:35:55,090 --> 01:35:56,891
( Sighs ) It wasn't a date!

1979
01:35:56,893 --> 01:36:00,061
In two weeks, Nicole
is going to have to testify

1980
01:36:00,063 --> 01:36:03,130
against her own father
in court.

1981
01:36:03,365 --> 01:36:06,234
What does that
have to do with you?

1982
01:36:11,974 --> 01:36:14,175
My mom left us
when I was a kid.

1983
01:36:14,177 --> 01:36:15,443
My dad turned into a lush.

1984
01:36:15,445 --> 01:36:18,646
I used to go by the bars after
school to help work off his bill.

1985
01:36:18,648 --> 01:36:22,016
Nicole used to come by
and pick up her old man.

1986
01:36:22,018 --> 01:36:26,153
He was usually passed out
in a corner somewhere.

1987
01:36:26,155 --> 01:36:29,156
It was kind of
a regular routine.

1988
01:36:29,524 --> 01:36:32,026
We never really talked much.

1989
01:36:32,594 --> 01:36:33,461
Well,

1990
01:36:33,463 --> 01:36:37,331
one day, my old man
started a fight.

1991
01:36:37,566 --> 01:36:40,434
I tried stopping him
and ended up getting hammered

1992
01:36:40,436 --> 01:36:43,571
between him and Nicole's dad.

1993
01:36:44,273 --> 01:36:45,439
Bartender called the police,

1994
01:36:45,441 --> 01:36:47,608
and all of us
were hauled off to jail.

1995
01:36:47,610 --> 01:36:50,611
Nicole and I
were given a choice.

1996
01:36:51,079 --> 01:36:52,346
Could go back home,

1997
01:36:52,348 --> 01:36:53,481
or we could press charges

1998
01:36:53,483 --> 01:36:56,484
and have to live as a ward
of the state.

1999
01:36:56,486 --> 01:36:59,487
Nicole was younger,
so she went back home.

2000
01:36:59,489 --> 01:37:01,122
I left and... ( Chuckles )

2001
01:37:01,124 --> 01:37:02,456
I never looked back

2002
01:37:02,458 --> 01:37:03,658
when I was old enough,

2003
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:05,393
I left the state home,

2004
01:37:05,395 --> 01:37:08,562
and I've been
supporting myself ever since.

2005
01:37:08,564 --> 01:37:10,665
Her dad turned
into a mean drunk.

2006
01:37:10,667 --> 01:37:13,067
She's been living
on his unemployment,

2007
01:37:13,069 --> 01:37:14,201
getting meals from guys,

2008
01:37:14,203 --> 01:37:16,103
shoplifting, whatever.

2009
01:37:16,105 --> 01:37:17,705
Well if it was that bad
for Nicole,

2010
01:37:17,707 --> 01:37:20,207
then why did she
take me to bars?

2011
01:37:20,209 --> 01:37:21,342
It's what she knows.

2012
01:37:21,344 --> 01:37:24,378
It was way better than staying
at home with her old man.

2013
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:26,113
Can you help her?

2014
01:37:26,115 --> 01:37:28,316
Be easier if...

2015
01:37:28,318 --> 01:37:31,319
She had a few friends around.

2016
01:37:33,322 --> 01:37:35,323
( Sighs )

2017
01:37:35,325 --> 01:37:37,525
I will be.

2018
01:37:37,527 --> 01:37:39,727
Sorry.

2019
01:37:39,729 --> 01:37:40,561
( Footsteps )

2020
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:45,166
Look, am I gonna have to fix
all these costumes by myself?

2021
01:37:45,168 --> 01:37:46,133
I mean, look at them.

2022
01:37:46,135 --> 01:37:48,736
Without me, you would
have <i>no</i> fashion sense.

2023
01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:50,237
Zip. Nada.

2024
01:37:50,239 --> 01:37:51,505
I mean, really?

2025
01:37:51,507 --> 01:37:53,107
Come on... oh... okay.

2026
01:37:53,109 --> 01:37:54,475
I get it.

2027
01:37:54,609 --> 01:37:55,977
Do you think you could help

2028
01:37:55,979 --> 01:37:57,345
with makeup, too?

2029
01:37:57,347 --> 01:37:57,745
Duh.

2030
01:37:57,747 --> 01:38:00,314
And can we get, like,
little halos or something?

2031
01:38:00,316 --> 01:38:04,585
I mean, you can't really
be an angel without them.

2032
01:38:05,087 --> 01:38:06,020
Don't see why not.

2033
01:38:06,022 --> 01:38:07,154
Just give me tin foil

2034
01:38:07,156 --> 01:38:09,623
and <i>lots</i> of glitter.

2035
01:38:13,996 --> 01:38:15,730
( Grunting )

2036
01:38:24,673 --> 01:38:26,040
I'll be right outside.

2037
01:38:26,042 --> 01:38:28,242
( Ventilator pumping )

2038
01:38:42,324 --> 01:38:43,357
( Gasping )

2039
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:47,194
I'm so sorry, angel.

2040
01:38:50,332 --> 01:38:52,166
( Sniffles )

2041
01:38:52,168 --> 01:38:55,669
I know... I know
I screwed up big-time.

2042
01:38:55,671 --> 01:38:57,705
Yeah.

2043
01:38:57,707 --> 01:38:59,273
Yeah.

2044
01:38:59,775 --> 01:39:01,409
( Sighs )

2045
01:39:01,743 --> 01:39:04,311
( Sobbing )
You never did anything

2046
01:39:04,313 --> 01:39:06,280
in your entire life
to deserve this.

2047
01:39:06,282 --> 01:39:09,683
I-I love you so much, baby.

2048
01:39:15,457 --> 01:39:17,258
( Sobs ) I'd give anything...

2049
01:39:17,260 --> 01:39:20,094
anything to have things
back the way they were.

2050
01:39:20,096 --> 01:39:21,629
I would.

2051
01:39:21,631 --> 01:39:23,631
( Sniffles )

2052
01:39:30,439 --> 01:39:33,641
( Gasps ) Angel's God...

2053
01:39:35,243 --> 01:39:37,078
( Sniffles )

2054
01:39:39,514 --> 01:39:41,382
I need to talk to you.

2055
01:39:41,384 --> 01:39:44,318
I need to talk to you.

2056
01:39:47,489 --> 01:39:48,489
( Sniffles )

2057
01:39:48,491 --> 01:39:49,390
She would...

2058
01:39:49,392 --> 01:39:51,092
she would always talk to you

2059
01:39:51,094 --> 01:39:52,693
like you were her friend.

2060
01:39:54,362 --> 01:39:57,131
She told me that
she prayed for me.

2061
01:39:57,133 --> 01:39:57,531
It...

2062
01:39:57,533 --> 01:40:01,702
it must've worked
because I'm still here, right?

2063
01:40:04,673 --> 01:40:07,575
( Sobs )
I never prayed for her.

2064
01:40:07,577 --> 01:40:09,477
Never.

2065
01:40:09,479 --> 01:40:11,679
And I know that's wrong...

2066
01:40:11,681 --> 01:40:14,748
On account that
she's in real trouble now,

2067
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:16,183
and it's all my fault.

2068
01:40:16,185 --> 01:40:18,385
( Sobs ) She told me that...

2069
01:40:18,387 --> 01:40:20,254
that Jesus...

2070
01:40:20,256 --> 01:40:21,856
( Sniffles )

2071
01:40:23,792 --> 01:40:27,461
Jesus went to hell for me...

2072
01:40:28,563 --> 01:40:29,730
To pay for what I did.

2073
01:40:29,732 --> 01:40:32,733
( Voice breaking ) To pay for...

2074
01:40:34,469 --> 01:40:37,238
to pay for what I did.

2075
01:40:39,708 --> 01:40:44,178
He must've been
tough as shit, because...

2076
01:40:45,413 --> 01:40:48,682
I can't handle
this hell I'm in.

2077
01:40:50,452 --> 01:40:54,255
I understand that, uh...

2078
01:40:54,422 --> 01:40:57,892
That you rose yourself
from the dead.

2079
01:40:57,894 --> 01:40:58,792
I get it.

2080
01:40:58,794 --> 01:41:00,194
I believe it. I do.

2081
01:41:00,196 --> 01:41:01,228
I believe it.

2082
01:41:01,230 --> 01:41:02,763
Believe it.

2083
01:41:07,769 --> 01:41:08,702
So it's not like...

2084
01:41:08,704 --> 01:41:14,475
it's not like it's a big deal for you
to get her out of this coma, right?

2085
01:41:16,178 --> 01:41:17,845
Right?

2086
01:41:24,553 --> 01:41:26,387
( Sniffles )

2087
01:41:30,859 --> 01:41:32,193
I know...

2088
01:41:32,195 --> 01:41:34,728
I know that I fucked up.

2089
01:41:37,365 --> 01:41:38,566
She told me

2090
01:41:38,568 --> 01:41:41,702
that you forgive everybody.

2091
01:41:43,205 --> 01:41:45,573
Even shits like me.

2092
01:41:54,349 --> 01:41:58,219
If you can...
if you can do anything,

2093
01:41:58,221 --> 01:42:00,321
anything with my life...

2094
01:42:02,224 --> 01:42:04,458
You can have it.

2095
01:42:04,859 --> 01:42:06,994
Just, please,

2096
01:42:06,996 --> 01:42:09,430
please,

2097
01:42:09,432 --> 01:42:11,532
don't let angel die.

2098
01:42:11,534 --> 01:42:14,401
Don't let her die on me.

2099
01:42:18,573 --> 01:42:22,843
( Sobbing ) She's my best friend.
I'm so sorry.

2100
01:42:23,411 --> 01:42:24,712
I love you, baby.

2101
01:42:24,714 --> 01:42:26,780
I love you.

2102
01:42:53,975 --> 01:42:56,343
Thank you. All right.
That's for the animals.

2103
01:42:56,345 --> 01:42:57,611
Slow down.
You're going too fast.

2104
01:42:57,613 --> 01:43:00,714
Can I please have all my angels
on the steps over here?

2105
01:43:00,716 --> 01:43:02,549
I forgot what I'm
supposed to say.

2106
01:43:02,551 --> 01:43:04,585
Just remember
why you need the room,

2107
01:43:04,587 --> 01:43:06,620
and you'll say the right thing.

2108
01:43:06,622 --> 01:43:07,454
Hey, Nicole,

2109
01:43:07,456 --> 01:43:09,556
where's that glittery
star you made?

2110
01:43:09,558 --> 01:43:10,791
I mean, I've got a rig

2111
01:43:10,793 --> 01:43:12,760
and a slot, but no star.

2112
01:43:12,762 --> 01:43:15,529
Shepherds, pay attention.

2113
01:43:15,531 --> 01:43:16,964
When watching
over your flock at night,

2114
01:43:16,966 --> 01:43:19,633
do not... repeat, do not
step on the electrical cords.

2115
01:43:19,635 --> 01:43:23,003
Okay, here we go. And a five, six,
seven, eight. ( Plays chord )

2116
01:43:23,005 --> 01:43:27,941
Girl: Hey, you didn't say, "and
a one, and a two, and a three."

2117
01:43:27,943 --> 01:43:29,810
All right, I'll give you
a one and a two.

2118
01:43:29,812 --> 01:43:33,414
Kevin, stop
picking your nose, buddy.

2119
01:43:33,416 --> 01:43:35,549
( Piano playing )

2120
01:43:35,551 --> 01:43:36,950
Who's there?

2121
01:43:36,952 --> 01:43:37,851
What do you want?

2122
01:43:37,853 --> 01:43:41,755
Fear not. You're extremely
flavored of the lord.

2123
01:43:41,757 --> 01:43:42,956
What's that mean?

2124
01:43:42,958 --> 01:43:45,893
God loves you,
and he picked <i>you</i>

2125
01:43:45,895 --> 01:43:47,461
to be the mother of his kid.

2126
01:43:47,463 --> 01:43:48,796
You know, the son of God.

2127
01:43:48,798 --> 01:43:51,065
Uh-uh! I'm a virgin.

2128
01:43:51,067 --> 01:43:53,367
Uh-huh. So what do I do?

2129
01:43:53,369 --> 01:43:56,637
Nothing. God will
take care of everything,

2130
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:59,373
including talking to Joseph
about it.

2131
01:43:59,375 --> 01:44:02,443
Okay. If you say so.

2132
01:44:03,912 --> 01:44:05,446
Hey, Joe, wake up.

2133
01:44:05,448 --> 01:44:07,915
Mary's with child. Say what?

2134
01:44:07,917 --> 01:44:08,849
She's pregnant.

2135
01:44:08,851 --> 01:44:10,751
I didn't <i>do</i> anything.

2136
01:44:10,753 --> 01:44:11,852
We know, we know.

2137
01:44:11,854 --> 01:44:12,953
She really is a virgin.

2138
01:44:12,955 --> 01:44:14,855
What do you want <i>meto do?</i>

2139
01:44:14,857 --> 01:44:16,390
First, marry her.

2140
01:44:16,392 --> 01:44:17,491
But don't touch her.

2141
01:44:17,493 --> 01:44:20,961
Then, name the baby Jesus.

2142
01:44:20,963 --> 01:44:21,729
Anything else?

2143
01:44:21,731 --> 01:44:23,030
Yeah, take good care of them.

2144
01:44:23,032 --> 01:44:25,799
I'll be bringing
more instructions later.

2145
01:44:25,801 --> 01:44:31,739
Kevin: <i>Caesar was disgusted and
sent everyone home to be taxed.</i>

2146
01:44:31,741 --> 01:44:33,407
My wife's having a baby.

2147
01:44:33,409 --> 01:44:34,608
Let me it. Child: <i>No!</i>

2148
01:44:34,610 --> 01:44:38,379
You're supposed to say,
"there's no room at the inn!"

2149
01:44:38,381 --> 01:44:39,947
<i>I said "no," didn't I?</i>

2150
01:44:39,949 --> 01:44:40,814
What do we do?

2151
01:44:40,816 --> 01:44:44,885
<i>You can sleep in the barn if you want.
</i> Thanks.

2152
01:44:46,621 --> 01:44:49,123
( Piano playing )

2153
01:44:51,526 --> 01:44:53,427
The star stopped.

2154
01:44:53,429 --> 01:44:55,763
Look! There's the castle
over there.

2155
01:44:55,765 --> 01:45:00,467
Well, the lights are on.
So they must still be up.

2156
01:45:04,072 --> 01:45:06,673
Boy: Hi, we're very wise men.

2157
01:45:06,675 --> 01:45:09,009
<i>And</i> wise woman. I'm horrid.

2158
01:45:09,011 --> 01:45:12,713
We've been following his star
for a very long time.

2159
01:45:12,715 --> 01:45:14,181
Then you must be hungry.

2160
01:45:14,183 --> 01:45:15,416
Come enjoy some twinkies

2161
01:45:15,418 --> 01:45:19,119
while I check it out
with my wise guys.

2162
01:45:20,555 --> 01:45:22,656
( Audience laughing )

2163
01:45:23,525 --> 01:45:26,493
My boys say <i>if</i> it's true,

2164
01:45:26,495 --> 01:45:29,062
he's supposed to be born
in Bethlehem.

2165
01:45:29,064 --> 01:45:30,431
Boy: Where's that?

2166
01:45:30,433 --> 01:45:31,198
Not too far from here.

2167
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:33,066
I'll show you on my g.P.S.

You owe me now.

2171

So when you find out

01:45:40,543 --> 01:45:42,810
Do <i>you</i> want
to worship him, too?

They're okay.

But I'm bored.

2180
01:46:08,237 --> 01:46:10,737
Nothing <i>ever</i> happens
in Bethlehem.

2181
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:14,975
When I'm old enough,
I'm going to Jerusalem,

You shall find a babe
wrapped in swaddling clothes,

2199
01:47:07,229 --> 01:47:08,562
lying in a manger.

2200
01:47:08,564 --> 01:47:10,898
What are swaddling clothes?

2201
01:47:10,900 --> 01:47:12,699
Kevin: Pampers, dummy.

2202
01:47:12,701 --> 01:47:14,768
Let's check it out.

2203
01:47:14,770 --> 01:47:17,204
What about our sheep?

2204
01:47:17,206 --> 01:47:19,072
Bring 'em with.

And on earth, peace.

2208
01:47:24,613 --> 01:47:26,747
Goodwill to all men.
