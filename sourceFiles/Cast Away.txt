01:52:17,392 --> 01:52:20,692
<i>She's... sort of lost.</i>

690
01:52:23,367 --> 01:52:25,437
Maybe you could just
give her a little more time.

691
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:33,350
Anyway, uh,

692
01:52:33,544 --> 01:52:35,364
I'm sorry that...

693
01:53:05,484 --> 01:53:07,304
[Inaudible]

694
01:53:32,909 --> 01:53:34,729
Okay, people, let's go.

695
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:37,050
Party's over. Let's go home.
Let's go home.

696
01:53:37,247 --> 01:53:39,667
<i>[Maynard] You're definitely
gonna have to go down to the DMV.</i>

697
01:53:39,886 --> 01:53:42,306
Okay, Maynard, let's go.
Chuck's had a big day.

698
01:53:42,524 --> 01:53:44,404
- I have to brief this man
on his meetings tomorrow...
- I know.

699
01:53:44,588 --> 01:53:46,408
With the accountants
and the attorneys, all right?

700
01:53:46,591 --> 01:53:48,961
I will see you
bright and early in the morning.

701
01:53:49,156 --> 01:53:53,256
- Hey, Chuck, welcome home. We love you.
- Becca, I need to speak to you.

702
01:53:53,567 --> 01:53:56,977
You know, Chuck, we gotta catch up
on some of that fishin', now.

703
01:53:57,269 --> 01:53:59,089
Take care.

704
01:54:01,805 --> 01:54:04,145
- Good night.
- Good night.

705
01:54:07,384 --> 01:54:09,684
You got everything
you need? Okay.

706
01:54:09,886 --> 01:54:11,706
Well, if you need anything,
just sign for it,

707
01:54:11,888 --> 01:54:14,018
and I'll see you
in the morning.

708
01:54:14,224 --> 01:54:16,874
Get some sleep, okay?
We got another big day tomorrow.

709
01:54:17,092 --> 01:54:19,422
It takes a lot of paperwork
to bring back a man.

710
01:54:21,190 --> 01:54:24,330
<i>- Bring you back to life, man.
- [Becca] Bye, Chuck.</i>

711
01:54:24,568 --> 01:54:26,668
- Take care, now.
- Tomorrow.

712
01:54:26,904 --> 01:54:28,974
Tomorrow we're gonna
bring you back to life.

713
01:56:13,987 --> 01:56:15,807
How long are you
gonna be, man?

714
01:56:18,554 --> 01:56:21,044
Well...

715
01:56:21,255 --> 01:56:24,195
- how long will that buy me?
- About ten minutes.

716
01:56:48,586 --> 01:56:50,476
I'm awake.

717
01:56:50,693 --> 01:56:52,633
I saw your taxi drive up.

718
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:57,080
Get in here
out of the rain.

719
01:57:04,270 --> 01:57:06,380
I saw you
down at the hub today,

720
01:57:06,574 --> 01:57:08,744
so I know you were down there.

721
01:57:27,263 --> 01:57:29,053
Let me get you a towel.

722
01:57:41,111 --> 01:57:42,931
They're sleeping.

723
01:57:46,815 --> 01:57:48,885
If you come in,
I'll make you some coffee.

724
01:58:02,498 --> 01:58:04,318
It's a nice house.

725
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:06,320
Yeah, we got
a nice mortgage too.

726
01:58:14,208 --> 01:58:16,768
What's your daughter's name?

727
01:58:16,982 --> 01:58:19,402
<i>Katie.</i>

728
01:58:19,620 --> 01:58:21,440
Katie.

729
01:58:24,928 --> 01:58:27,828
<i>- She's a beautiful little girl.
- She's a handful.</i>

730
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:44,100
Just let me get
one thing straight here.

731
01:58:54,188 --> 01:58:57,258
We have a pro football team now,
but they're in Nashville?

732
01:58:59,830 --> 01:59:02,730
[Sighs, Chuckles]

733
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:07,890
Um, yeah. Oh, my God. Okay.
They used to be in Houston.

734
01:59:08,203 --> 01:59:12,133
<i>First they were the Oilers,
and now they're the Titans.</i>

735
01:59:12,406 --> 01:59:14,926
The Houston Oilers
are the Tennessee Titans?

736
01:59:15,148 --> 01:59:16,968
Yeah.

737
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:18,970
But that's not all.

738
01:59:19,152 --> 01:59:22,002
They went to the Super Bowl
last year.

739
01:59:22,218 --> 01:59:24,678
<i>- And I missed that.
- You would've died. It was so exciting.</i>

740
01:59:24,888 --> 01:59:28,238
They almost won by one yard.
One lousy yard right at the end.

741
01:59:30,863 --> 01:59:33,993
I got whole milk,
2% and nonfat.

742
01:59:34,231 --> 01:59:36,371
<i>I don't have any half-and-half,
and that's what you like.</i>

743
01:59:37,766 --> 01:59:39,596
That'll do fine.

744
01:59:52,751 --> 01:59:54,861
What happened to you
becoming a professor?

745
01:59:56,995 --> 02:00:00,605
You're not
Dr. Kelly Frears-Lovett?

746
02:00:04,002 --> 02:00:06,332
When you, um...

747
02:00:06,536 --> 02:00:09,256
When your plane went down,

748
02:00:09,466 --> 02:00:11,576
everything just sort of
got put on hold.

749
02:00:14,576 --> 02:00:16,876
I think about
taking it up again, though.

750
02:00:29,196 --> 02:00:31,016
I came out here
to give you this.

751
02:00:32,825 --> 02:00:34,655
Oh, my God.

752
02:00:36,871 --> 02:00:38,691
I'm sorry it doesn't work.

753
02:00:40,406 --> 02:00:43,026
And I, uh,
I kept the picture.

754
02:00:44,441 --> 02:00:46,331
It was all faded anyway.

755
02:00:47,841 --> 02:00:50,461
I want you to have it.
I gave it to you.

756
02:00:50,677 --> 02:00:53,587
That's a family heirloom,
and it should stay in your family.

757
02:01:03,826 --> 02:01:06,446
<i>That's everything I have
from when you went down to now.</i>

758
02:01:08,832 --> 02:01:11,202
They said they never figured out
what caused the crash.

759
02:01:11,439 --> 02:01:14,819
Probably some mislabeled
hazardous material caught fire.

760
02:01:19,384 --> 02:01:21,584
So here's where
that ship found you.

761
02:01:22,982 --> 02:01:26,012
You drifted about 500 miles.

762
02:01:26,256 --> 02:01:28,356
This is where
your island was,

763
02:01:28,561 --> 02:01:31,721
about 600 miles
south of the Cook Islands.

764
02:01:33,524 --> 02:01:35,604
And these are
the search grids.

765
02:01:35,798 --> 02:01:38,548
Ships went back and forth
for weeks looking for you.

766
02:01:47,779 --> 02:01:49,719
I never should've
gotten on that plane.

767
02:01:52,211 --> 02:01:54,581
I never should've
gotten out of the car.

768
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:00,340
I wanna show you something.

769
02:02:02,555 --> 02:02:04,385
Come here.

770
02:02:14,172 --> 02:02:15,962
This is...
This is our car.

771
02:02:18,479 --> 02:02:20,299
You kept our car.

772
02:02:22,618 --> 02:02:25,718
All right, now,
this is weird.

773
02:02:34,329 --> 02:02:36,369
It's a good car.

774
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:38,770
Had a lot of memories
in this car.

775
02:02:38,969 --> 02:02:41,449
Two very nice memories.

776
02:02:41,670 --> 02:02:43,610
Oh, that trip
down to the Gulf, yeah.

777
02:02:46,310 --> 02:02:48,130
So, can I drive it?

778
02:02:48,344 --> 02:02:50,164
It's your car.

779
02:02:57,989 --> 02:03:00,989
That's good, 'cause my...
my taxi's gone.

780
02:03:07,228 --> 02:03:09,468
Um...

781
02:03:09,668 --> 02:03:11,488
Let me get some stuff
out of the back.

782
02:03:34,121 --> 02:03:36,391
You think you're gonna
have more kids?

783
02:03:36,593 --> 02:03:38,413
I don't know.

784
02:03:38,595 --> 02:03:41,315
It's kind of confusing
right now.

785
02:03:41,536 --> 02:03:44,116
Well, you should.

786
02:03:44,341 --> 02:03:46,191
I mean, really,
you should.

787
02:03:48,741 --> 02:03:50,561
I would.

788
02:03:52,808 --> 02:03:54,638
So, what now?

789
02:03:57,813 --> 02:03:59,643
I don't know.

790
02:04:02,256 --> 02:04:04,076
I really don't know.

791
02:04:12,600 --> 02:04:14,420
[Starts Engine]

792
02:04:16,875 --> 02:04:18,695
You said
you'd be right back.

793
02:04:24,008 --> 02:04:25,838
I'm so sorry.

794
02:04:27,918 --> 02:04:29,738
Me too.

795
02:05:38,764 --> 02:05:40,584
Chuck!

796
02:05:44,562 --> 02:05:47,152
Chuck!

797
02:05:47,367 --> 02:05:49,157
Chuck!

798
02:06:06,554 --> 02:06:08,374
I always knew you were alive.

799
02:06:08,598 --> 02:06:11,078
I knew it.

800
02:06:11,330 --> 02:06:13,340
But everybody said
I had to stop saying that...

801
02:06:13,562 --> 02:06:15,452
that I had to let you go.

802
02:06:16,972 --> 02:06:19,752
I love you.

803
02:06:19,975 --> 02:06:21,725
You're the love of my life.

804
02:06:24,375 --> 02:06:26,195
I love you too, Kelly.

805
02:06:27,910 --> 02:06:29,740
More than you'll ever know.

806
02:07:30,852 --> 02:07:32,672
Chuck?

807
02:07:39,653 --> 02:07:42,343
You have to go home.

808
02:08:30,812 --> 02:08:32,752
We both had done
the math, and...

809
02:08:35,254 --> 02:08:37,524
Kelly added it all up.

810
02:08:39,321 --> 02:08:41,141
She knew she had
to let me go.

811
02:08:41,323 --> 02:08:45,483
I added it up,
knew that I'd...

812
02:08:45,765 --> 02:08:47,585
I'd lost her.

813
02:08:49,571 --> 02:08:51,671
'Cause I was never gonna
get off that island.

814
02:08:54,837 --> 02:08:57,297
I was gonna die there,

815
02:08:57,538 --> 02:08:59,368
totally alone.

816
02:09:05,849 --> 02:09:08,599
I mean, I was gonna get sick or
I was gonna get injured or something.

817
02:09:12,857 --> 02:09:14,677
The only choice I had,

818
02:09:17,466 --> 02:09:19,636
the only thing
I could control...

819
02:09:21,835 --> 02:09:25,155
was when and how...

820
02:09:25,401 --> 02:09:27,231
and where
that was gonna happen.

821
02:09:27,403 --> 02:09:31,683
So... I made a rope.

822
02:09:34,984 --> 02:09:37,734
And I went up to the summit
to hang myself.

823
02:09:41,460 --> 02:09:43,430
But I had to test it,
you know?

824
02:09:43,629 --> 02:09:46,409
Of course.
You know me.

825
02:09:48,499 --> 02:09:50,319
And the weight of the log...

826
02:09:50,501 --> 02:09:53,631
snapped the limb
of the tree.

827
02:09:53,869 --> 02:09:55,729
So l-l...

828
02:09:55,902 --> 02:09:58,392
I couldn't even kill myself
the way I wanted to.

829
02:09:58,614 --> 02:10:01,394
I had power over nothing.

830
02:10:10,053 --> 02:10:13,433
And that's when this feeling
came over me like a warm blanket.

831
02:10:17,634 --> 02:10:19,574
I knew...

832
02:10:19,761 --> 02:10:21,941
somehow...

833
02:10:22,139 --> 02:10:24,339
that I had to stay alive.

834
02:10:26,070 --> 02:10:27,890
Somehow.

835
02:10:29,073 --> 02:10:31,243
I had to keep breathing,

836
02:10:33,943 --> 02:10:35,893
even though there was
no reason to hope.

837
02:10:38,187 --> 02:10:41,667
And all my logic said that
I would never see this place again.

838
02:10:46,727 --> 02:10:49,377
So that's what I did.

839
02:10:49,595 --> 02:10:52,015
I stayed alive.

840
02:10:52,233 --> 02:10:54,053
I kept breathing.

841
02:10:56,404 --> 02:10:58,544
And then one day
that logic was proven all wrong,

842
02:10:58,740 --> 02:11:00,560
because the tide...

843
02:11:02,775 --> 02:11:05,165
came in,
gave me a sail.

844
02:11:10,023 --> 02:11:11,843
And now, here I am.

845
02:11:15,289 --> 02:11:18,109
I'm back...

846
02:11:18,323 --> 02:11:20,713
in Memphis, talking to you.

847
02:11:22,932 --> 02:11:25,322
I have ice in my glass.

848
02:11:32,140 --> 02:11:34,410
And I've lost her
all over again.

849
02:11:42,390 --> 02:11:44,690
I'm so sad that
I don't have Kelly.

850
02:11:49,961 --> 02:11:53,191
But I'm so grateful that
she was with me on that island.

851
02:12:00,503 --> 02:12:02,513
And I know
what I have to do now.

852
02:12:05,551 --> 02:12:07,491
I gotta keep breathing.

853
02:12:10,253 --> 02:12:12,613
Because tomorrow,
the sun will rise.

854
02:12:13,987 --> 02:12:16,377
Who knows what the tide
could bring?

855
02:12:30,442 --> 02:12:33,852
<i>[Elvis Presley]
I gave a letter to the postman  </i>

856
02:12:34,112 --> 02:12:35,932
<i> He put it in his sack  </i>

857
02:12:37,845 --> 02:12:40,845
<i> Bright and early
next morning  </i>

858
02:12:41,088 --> 02:12:43,608
<i> He brought my letter back  </i>

859
02:12:43,820 --> 02:12:45,640
<i> She wrote upon it  </i>

860
02:12:45,823 --> 02:12:47,643
<i> Return to sender  </i>

861
02:12:49,055 --> 02:12:51,005
<i> Address unknown  </i>

862
02:12:53,330 --> 02:12:55,150
