1
00:01:08,886 --> 00:01:10,888
Hello. Hello.

2
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:24,989
I wonder what's holding them up.

3
00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:27,992
Don't worry about that, Father.
We'll be going soon.

4
00:01:30,199 --> 00:01:33,502
John, did you feed them hounds?
Yes, Grandpa, yes.

5
00:01:33,577 --> 00:01:36,672
All right.
Now tighten her up, Son.

6
00:01:36,747 --> 00:01:39,125
She'll take us
where we're going.

7
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:42,215
Yes, but where
are we going?

8
00:01:42,294 --> 00:01:45,013
Now, Ma, they're thrashin' that
matter out over there now.

9
00:01:45,088 --> 00:01:47,511
Pa, they made you the leader.

10
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:49,013
Why don't you say
where to go?

11
00:01:49,092 --> 00:01:51,436
I'm only leader of
the Missourians, Daughter.

12
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:54,857
There are families here from every
state in the Union, I reckon.

13
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:56,058
Can't be waitin' on
'em forever, Dad.

14
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:57,233
No, Son.

15
00:01:57,309 --> 00:01:59,687
They're holding a powwow
over there now.

16
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,694
I'll just step over and see
what they got to say.

17
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:10,453
Well, bless our wild heart.
If it ain't Breck Coleman.

18
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:12,416
How are you, Zeke?

19
00:02:12,491 --> 00:02:15,540
Where at you been hidin' yourself
for the last year, boy?

20
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:18,543
Been down Santa Fe way, Zeke.
Just drifted in.

21
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:20,169
And here's Windy Bill.
Looks like you've

22
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:21,751
wintered through
in good shape.

23
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:25,963
Well, Coleman, most times I
winter through in fair shape.

24
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:30,768
This year, when the first grass
showed, I'd only put on 60 pounds.

25
00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:35,439
Say, Bascom, he maybe could

26
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:37,858
tell us of a likely
stretch of country.

27
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:42,439
Breck, could you sight us to a second
Missouri anywheres out yonder?

28
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:47,243
Sure. But it's a long,
tough pull from here.

29
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:50,241
2,500 mile the way
you'd have to go.

30
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,453
No, it's too far off.

31
00:02:53,532 --> 00:02:55,955
No place is too far
if it's what we want.

32
00:02:56,034 --> 00:02:57,661
This is a land
beyond Oregon.

33
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,418
There ain't no land
beyond Oregon, mister.

34
00:03:00,497 --> 00:03:03,296
West of Oregon comes the ocean,
way it's been told to me.

35
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,298
This stretch is
north of Oregon.

36
00:03:05,377 --> 00:03:07,596
How many people
settled on it now?

37
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:09,048
It's Indian country.

38
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:13,136
Except for the trappers, never a
white man has left his track there.

39
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:15,391
Only one trading post
in that whole country.

40
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,517
Who owns it?

41
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:17,940
A Missouri trapper owns it.

42
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:19,813
Hey, mister, will you tell me this...

43
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:21,643
Hey, hey, there.

44
00:03:21,727 --> 00:03:23,855
Since you all
elected me the he-coon

45
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,031
of this outfit,
let me do the talking.

46
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:29,360
It's everything a Missourian's
heart could crave.

47
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:33,698
There's two snow-capped mountain
ranges with peaks lost in the sky.

48
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:37,786
And between them ranges, men,
is a great valley.

49
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:39,916
Lakes and streams everywhere.

50
00:03:39,995 --> 00:03:42,248
Fish, you ask, and game?

51
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:43,958
There's salmon
swarmin' up them rivers

52
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,634
thicker than blackbirds
in a cane patch.

53
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:48,804
Friend, will you undertake
to lead us to that valley?

54
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,849
I'd like nothin'
better, men...

55
00:03:51,923 --> 00:03:54,301
But our trails fork here.

56
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:55,636
I've got
business that calls me

57
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,596
back down
the road Santa Fe way.

58
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:59,056
What business do
you follow, friend?

59
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,140
I'm a trapper.

60
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:01,975
Well, surely there's
fur aplenty

61
00:04:02,059 --> 00:04:03,811
out in that land
beyond Oregon.

62
00:04:03,894 --> 00:04:05,817
Plenty.

63
00:04:05,896 --> 00:04:08,775
But I gotta kill me
a pair of skunks,

64
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:10,780
back apiece on
the road to Santa Fe.

65
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:14,989
Hey, wait, wait. Friend, how
do you find that valley?

66
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:17,325
Wellmore here is
sending a bull train clear

67
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:20,160
through to old Tom Williams's
trading post.

68
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:22,496
First time
it's ever been tried.

69
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:27,210
String along behind them and, if they
make it through, you'll find your valley.

70
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:30,216
And tell that great white
mountain hello for me.

71
00:04:30,295 --> 00:04:31,672
Good-bye, Zeke.

72
00:04:31,755 --> 00:04:34,133
Well, thanks, boy.

73
00:04:34,216 --> 00:04:35,763
Hey!

74
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:39,479
Hey, maybe he fed us a fairy tale.

75
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:03,002
Now don't be a pig,
you know.

76
00:05:03,078 --> 00:05:05,251
Howdy, Mrs. Riggs.

77
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,456
Land's sakes!

78
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,841
Well, you sure look fine,
Mother Riggs.

79
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,843
It's a long time
since I've seen you.

80
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:17,509
You know, you always was
a great hand to wander.

81
00:05:17,592 --> 00:05:19,845
Yeah, I ramble around.

82
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:21,305
And how are
the little twins?

83
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,641
Little? My lands!

84
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:26,227
Them girls has grown
since you seen 'em last.

85
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:27,310
No!
Mm-hmm.

86
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:28,566
They in the house?

87
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:31,774
Mildred is. Elise went down
to watch the boat come in.

88
00:05:31,857 --> 00:05:33,905
I reckon I'll saunter in
and surprise Mildred.

89
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:36,078
Oh, you sure will
surprise them.

90
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,754
Well, Breck, I sure am
glad to see you.

91
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:54,804
Well, you certainly
have doubled in size

92
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,848
since last I set
eyes on you, Mildred.

93
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,925
You just must see Elise.

94
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:01,558
I'll surely see
her before I leave.

95
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:04,348
<i>There's the
Peensie Bell whistling now.</i>

96
00:06:06,475 --> 00:06:07,727
Ooh, look at the crowd.

97
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:08,856
Oh, look.

98
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:22,783
Okay. I guess it is
important to have everything ready.

99
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:23,958
I have everything ready.

100
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:27,004
Well, Miss Cameron, we be
landin' in a few minutes.

101
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:28,375
Got all your
outfit together?

102
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:29,707
Most everything's ready,
Captain Hollister.

103
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,261
Listen, why don't you give up
this plan and turn back?

104
00:06:34,336 --> 00:06:37,135
Why, there's no place
to turn back to.

105
00:06:37,214 --> 00:06:40,639
Why, there isn't a home in all the South
that wouldn't welcome the daughter

106
00:06:40,717 --> 00:06:41,809
of Colonel Cameron.

107
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:45,105
True. But we can hardly
become perpetual visitors.

108
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,308
It's a tough
proposition, girl,

109
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,189
this pioneer life in
a savage wilderness.

110
00:06:50,268 --> 00:06:52,362
We realize that,
Captain Hollister,

111
00:06:52,437 --> 00:06:54,690
but we must keep
the family together.

112
00:06:54,773 --> 00:06:57,071
Honey Girl wants to stay with
her sister Ruth, doesn't she?

113
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,322
Yes, I do.

114
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:01,496
And our brother Dave's
almost a man grown.

115
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:05,576
Ruth is right, Captain. The Cameron
tribe must stick together.

116
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,006
Say, you're
just the fella I want to see.

117
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:18,885
I want to play some more
of that shell game.

118
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:21,926
Have you got
any more money?

119
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,261
Oh, sure I got some money.

120
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,138
Where'd you get that?

121
00:07:27,222 --> 00:07:28,314
From my mother-in-law.

122
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,065
She lend it to me,
but she don't know it.

123
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:34,817
Here, I'll meet you below deck.
Get along.

124
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:36,990
Don't forget.
I wait there for you.

125
00:07:46,324 --> 00:07:49,043
Are you still determined
to be a sturdy pioneer?

126
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:51,713
Quite determined,
Mr. Thorpe.

127
00:07:51,788 --> 00:07:55,759
I've told you about
my plantation in Louisiana.

128
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:57,882
It must be wonderful.

129
00:07:57,961 --> 00:08:01,340
Miss Cameron, those lands
and servants are yours,

130
00:08:01,423 --> 00:08:03,471
if you'll take me with them.

131
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,646
Why, I do thank you. But as I've
said before, it's quite impossible.

132
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,769
Good-bye, Mr. Thorpe.

133
00:08:15,186 --> 00:08:17,029
Now, if I win,
I'm going to keep it.

134
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:20,200
But if I lose, I give
my mother-in-law half.

135
00:08:22,277 --> 00:08:23,699
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Here we are again.

136
00:08:23,778 --> 00:08:24,950
Hello, Thorpe.

137
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,829
Well, Gussie, you want to see the
elusive little ball under the shells.

138
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,582
There you are. Now it's bound
to be under one of them.

139
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,039
There's one, there's two,
and there's three.

140
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:37,422
Now we'll shuffle them just a
little bit, just to confuse you.

141
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,468
And take your choice.

142
00:08:39,544 --> 00:08:42,263
Now wait, I show you.
Here, I bet you two dollars.

143
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:44,967
Two dollars. Covered.

144
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,597
I always do that
for good luck.

145
00:08:48,553 --> 00:08:50,851
Now wait. I show you.
Now watch.

146
00:08:54,726 --> 00:08:57,354
Ah, you see, Gussie, the
hand is faster than the eye.

147
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,859
Better luck next time.

148
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:09,450
Oh, here. Who wants to buy
my mother-in-law's stocking?

149
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:12,752
Gus!

150
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:16,377
Oh, there you are. What do you
mean by spending my money?

151
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:20,131
But, Mama, I'm going
to give you half.

152
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,462
Give me my money.

153
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:22,716
Give it to her.

154
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,391
Hurry UP-

155
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:28,643
Give me the rest of it.

156
00:09:28,718 --> 00:09:29,890
Why, madam,
that's my own money.

157
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,062
That's my money.

158
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,606
No, no, Mama.
That's his money.

159
00:09:35,016 --> 00:09:37,769
Captain, I demand that
that man give me my money.

160
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:39,854
Hand it over.

161
00:09:42,941 --> 00:09:45,911
See, Mama? Didn't I
tell you we would win?

162
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:50,332
Why, you big loafer! Get out of here!
Spending my life's earnings!

163
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:52,956
Now, Thorpe,
you get off of my boat.

164
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:55,457
If you set foot on it again,
I'll put you in irons

165
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:58,131
and land you at St. Charles
on my way back.

166
00:10:06,131 --> 00:10:08,350
Davey, I think I better
go find Mrs. Riggs,

167
00:10:08,425 --> 00:10:10,848
that lady Captain Hollister
told us about.

168
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:12,019
Come on, Honey Girl.

169
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,189
No. I want to stay here with
Davey and watch them unload.

170
00:10:14,264 --> 00:10:15,481
Well, you take good
care of her, Davey.

171
00:10:15,557 --> 00:10:16,524
I will.

172
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:18,693
I'll be right back,
Honey Girl.

173
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,235
It's a nice place, ain't it, Mama?

174
00:10:22,313 --> 00:10:25,567
It's terrible!
Look at the mud!

175
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,278
Well, listen, Mama, I gonna
go see if I can buy a horse.

176
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,284
Come on. Come on.
I carry you over there.

177
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,583
I don't want you to get your feet wet.
That's it. Here we go.

178
00:10:38,496 --> 00:10:40,965
Now you stay there.
I bring Abbie over.

179
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,011
Come on, Abbie. I don't want you
to get your shoes all muddy.

180
00:10:44,085 --> 00:10:45,211
That's it.
Come on. Here we go.

181
00:10:46,421 --> 00:10:49,766
Oh, stop laughing,
will you, Abbie?

182
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:53,061
That's it. Now you wait here.
I bring Mama.

183
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:55,935
Come on, Mama.
I take you over, Mama.

184
00:10:56,014 --> 00:10:57,937
Come on, Mama.

185
00:10:58,016 --> 00:10:59,313
Come on, Mama. It's...

186
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,941
Here! What are
you trying to do?

187
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,317
But, Mama,
I want to carry you across

188
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,069
so you won't
get your feet wet.

189
00:11:05,148 --> 00:11:08,197
You? I'll cross
my own mud.

190
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:11,576
All right then, Mama, but let me help you.
That's it, Mama. Come on now.

191
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:14,498
Okay, step on that board, Mama.
That's it, Mama.

192
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,167
Ohh!

193
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,290
Say, I come right back.

194
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:19,962
Ohh! Oh, Gus!

195
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:26,261
Uh, Mrs. Riggs?

196
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:28,179
Yes, miss. That's me.

197
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:32,134
Well, I'm Miss Cameron. Captain
Hollister told me to see you.

198
00:11:32,217 --> 00:11:33,264
Friend of
Captain Hollister?

199
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:34,344
Yes, lam.

200
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,270
Come right on in.
Oh, thank you.

201
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:38,474
Now don't tear your pretty
dress on them logs.

202
00:11:41,518 --> 00:11:43,941
Oh, it's nice and cool
in here out of the sun.

203
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:57,534
Now you sit down,
make yourself easy,

204
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,085
and I'll brew
you a cup of tea.

205
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,539
Oh, that's awfully nice of
you, Mrs. Riggs. Thank you.

206
00:12:21,724 --> 00:12:23,818
No! Wha...

207
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:25,854
Why, what do
you mean by...

208
00:12:25,937 --> 00:12:26,938
Oh, I thought...

209
00:12:27,021 --> 00:12:28,523
Oh! Oh!

210
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,693
It was thisaway, ma'am, I
thought you were someone else.

211
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:35,201
Wait! It was thisaway. I
thought you were Elise, ma'am.

212
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,327
Elise?

213
00:12:36,406 --> 00:12:38,158
Yes. Just thought
I'd surprise her sort of.

214
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:39,993
Did you indeed?

215
00:12:40,702 --> 00:12:42,704
Let me tell ya.

216
00:12:44,122 --> 00:12:46,045
If you'll light someplace,
I'll tell ya.

217
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:47,171
Oh!

218
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,849
Oh.

219
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:56,426
What is it?
You're as pale as a ghost.

220
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,386
Oh, it's nothing,
Mr. Thorpe. Really. I...

221
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,434
But there must be something wrong.
Oh, nothing.

222
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,515
Just an
unpleasant occurrence.

223
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:03,942
I'm gonna
explain that play.

224
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,314
There's nothing to explain.

225
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:06,690
But I'm gonna
tell you anyhow.

226
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:09,192
It seems to me you're forcing
yourself on this lady.

227
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:10,364
Is that how
it seems to you?

228
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,862
How else can I take it?

229
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,035
It's nothing to me
how you take it.

230
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,363
But it matters a heap to me,
ma'am, how you understand.

231
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:19,040
Perhaps not. But if it
concerns Miss Cameron,

232
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:20,287
I'll demand an explanation.

233
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,710
You will?
Then speak your piece.

234
00:13:22,785 --> 00:13:27,165
Mr. Thorpe, will... Will you
please take me to my brother?

235
00:13:27,248 --> 00:13:30,843
With pleasure. I'll be
looking for you shortly.

236
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:33,923
Well, I won't be
hard to locate.

237
00:13:43,348 --> 00:13:44,816
Hello, Honey Girl.

238
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,188
Hello.

239
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:48,019
Thank you so much,
Mr. Thorpe.

240
00:13:48,102 --> 00:13:50,025
It's a great pleasure.

241
00:13:50,104 --> 00:13:54,200
Just think. This wagon will be
your home for the next six months.

242
00:13:54,275 --> 00:13:58,280
And after that,
a cabin in the wilderness.

243
00:13:58,363 --> 00:14:00,741
My mind is made up,
Mr. Thorpe.

244
00:14:00,823 --> 00:14:03,417
We're going
with the settlers.

245
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:05,166
You know my brother David.

246
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:06,246
Yes.

247
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:07,672
Hello, Dave.

248
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:09,124
How do you do?

249
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,751
Howdy, DOV!

250
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:13,802
Hello, Zeke.
Howdy, Bill.

251
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:17,382
Hey, Jack, I been tellin' you
about this here boy Coleman.

252
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:20,639
He can heave a knife
into a mark so big every time.

253
00:14:20,718 --> 00:14:22,595
I'll bet you
a buffalo hide he can't

254
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,556
heave it into
that post back of ya.

255
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,985
Call the bet! Now here.
Show him, boy.

256
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:42,282
Bless our wild heart!

257
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:44,993
Oh, I've seen him do it
a hundred times, eh, Bill?

258
00:14:45,076 --> 00:14:48,080
That's another buffalo hide
you owe me, Jack.

259
00:14:48,162 --> 00:14:50,836
You remember, Bill, that time
up, uh, on the Snake River...

260
00:14:50,915 --> 00:14:52,337
Oh, I sure do.

261
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:56,843
Say, boy, I want to know
about old Ben Griswell.

262
00:14:56,921 --> 00:14:59,299
I hear the
Indians downed him.

263
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:01,384
Only it wasn't
Injuns downed him.

264
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,969
No?

265
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:04,269
Renegade whites done it.

266
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:05,517
How come?

267
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:07,227
He'd been wolf in'
all winter.

268
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:08,433
Yeah?

269
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:11,269
Must've had $2,000, $3,000
worth of wolf pelts.

270
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:12,478
Oh, easy that.

271
00:15:12,562 --> 00:15:16,157
He was hacked up
and stuck full of arrows.

272
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:19,156
Looked like Injun work,
all right.

273
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:21,454
The wolf pelts was gone.

274
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,658
If ever I find
them hellhounds,

275
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:27,290
I'll sure make 'em
hunt their holes.

276
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,085
Come on.

277
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:47,519
Lopez, who's that young buck over
there with no hair on his face?

278
00:15:47,597 --> 00:15:51,397
That's, uh, Breck Coleman.
He very quick with his knife.

279
00:15:51,476 --> 00:15:53,399
Oh, where's he come from?

280
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:56,698
He come from the plains,
the mountains.

281
00:15:56,773 --> 00:15:58,696
He live with the Indians.

282
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:01,870
He can throw a knife
through the heart in 20 feet.

283
00:16:01,944 --> 00:16:05,198
He's the best shot
in all this country.

284
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:07,204
He knows everything.

285
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:10,127
He'll know too much
for his own good someday.

286
00:16:17,794 --> 00:16:20,798
Yes. All right.

287
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,805
If old Ben had lived, he'd be going
on about 72 now, wouldn't he?

288
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:53,338
Injuns never done this.

289
00:16:55,123 --> 00:16:57,217
It was renegade whites.

290
00:17:06,968 --> 00:17:09,141
And they've left their mark.

291
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,288
Oh, I'd say I do.

292
00:17:29,157 --> 00:17:32,878
Say, Zeke, who was that
he-grizzly that just went by?

293
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:35,205
Why, that's Red Flack. He's
bullwhackin' for Wellmore.

294
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,632
He's gonna whack Wellmore's
train clear through to Oregon.

295
00:17:37,707 --> 00:17:41,337
You reckon you'll ever find
out who downed old Ben?

296
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:45,890
It's just possible that a certain
low-down coyote left his sign there.

297
00:17:51,846 --> 00:17:53,189
Well, hello, Coleman.

298
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:54,607
Howdy, Wellmore.

299
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:58,732
I've changed my mind. I'll scout
for that bull train after all.

300
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,779
Well, that's a ray
of sunshine.

301
00:18:00,855 --> 00:18:03,278
Shake hands afore you
change your mind again.

302
00:18:03,357 --> 00:18:04,825
Got a good wagon boss
for the trip?

303
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:06,278
Red Flack.

304
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:09,072
A burly ruffian,
but he can maul

305
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,624
the toughest traitor on
the plains into a pulp

306
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:13,701
without even
working up a sweat.

307
00:18:13,784 --> 00:18:14,831
He can do that, eh?

308
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,333
Flack? Ha!

309
00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:18,756
Why, he likes to do it.
But he can run

310
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,129
a bull train.
Here he comes now.

311
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:23,507
Well, Wellmore,
all ready to start?

312
00:18:23,586 --> 00:18:26,055
Likely you two
have met before.

313
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:29,554
Nah.

314
00:18:29,634 --> 00:18:31,728
I reckon not.

315
00:18:31,802 --> 00:18:34,521
Coleman's gonna scout for the train.

316
00:18:34,597 --> 00:18:36,816
You understand, Flack,

317
00:18:36,891 --> 00:18:40,361
that he's to have final say in all
matters dealing with the Indians.

318
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:46,193
Yes? Well, who's got the final say
about bossin' this bull train?

319
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:48,869
He understands that
you're the wagon boss.

320
00:18:48,945 --> 00:18:50,947
Yeah. Another thing,
another thing...

321
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,408
Am I supposed to
be wet nurse to them

322
00:18:53,491 --> 00:18:56,745
woodenhead pilgrims
a-crossin' the plains?

323
00:18:56,827 --> 00:18:58,921
The more that goes along,
the better it is

324
00:18:58,996 --> 00:19:01,044
for them and you
in case Indians jump ya.

325
00:19:01,123 --> 00:19:04,502
Well, all right.
All right!

326
00:19:05,253 --> 00:19:09,303
Make it clear to him
that I'm wagon boss.

327
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,884
Oh, he understands
that, Flack.

328
00:19:15,263 --> 00:19:17,891
He seems to be
a right pleasant cuss.

329
00:19:17,974 --> 00:19:21,569
He's a ruffian,
but he's a real wagon boss.

330
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:23,646
Likely he is.

331
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:29,152
Must've done a big trade
in wolf pelts this year.

332
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:32,409
Yes, we had a big trade
with the wolfers.

333
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,913
Flack sell you
any of these?

334
00:19:35,992 --> 00:19:41,419
Flack? No. He didn't do any
wolfing last winter, I guess.

335
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:44,376
What outfit did you buy
the biggest bunch from?

336
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:47,587
Fella name of Lopez
come in about a month ago

337
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,344
with close on to
5,000 dollars' worth.

338
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:55,179
Lopez,eh?
I guess I don't know him.

339
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:58,481
I signed him up as a
bullwhacker on the train.

340
00:19:58,556 --> 00:20:00,604
You did, eh?

341
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:02,856
I'll see you next year.

342
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,562
Bring your scalp
along back whole.

343
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:05,988
All right. Good-bye.

344
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:07,356
Is that so?

345
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,441
It certainly is.

346
00:20:08,524 --> 00:20:10,777
I don't know whether they're
gonna get through or not...

347
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,079
Windy, I'm gonna scout
for that bull train.

348
00:20:13,154 --> 00:20:15,907
Good.

349
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,958
Oh, Mr. Cameron,
this is Mr. Coleman.

350
00:20:18,034 --> 00:20:19,957
Howdy, Mr. Coleman.
How do you do, sir?

351
00:20:20,036 --> 00:20:22,459
Uh, he can tell you more about
that country where you're going,

352
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:24,961
and what kind of an outfit you
need than any man around here.

353
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,634
Thanks.

354
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:30,179
Windy, throw my bags in with
yours and Zeke's, will ya?

355
00:20:30,254 --> 00:20:31,676
All right, I'll do.

356
00:20:31,756 --> 00:20:33,133
Tell Zeke I'm going along.

357
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:34,216
All right, boy.

358
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,723
Mr. Coleman, would you mind
looking over my outfit?

359
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:40,181
Certainly not. Uh, we'll go
have a peek at it. Where is it?

360
00:20:40,264 --> 00:20:42,562
Right over there, sir.

361
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:46,691
Honey Girl, it's time for
your history lesson, dear.

362
00:20:46,771 --> 00:20:50,241
Now, uh, how many stars
in the flag?

363
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:51,818
Twenty-six.

364
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:53,824
How many stripes?

365
00:20:53,903 --> 00:20:55,746
Thirty.

366
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,950
Now, you know better than that.
There's 13.

367
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:01,707
And what do they stand for?

368
00:21:01,786 --> 00:21:04,665
The 13 original colonies.
Now remember that.

369
00:21:04,747 --> 00:21:06,090
Now, who discovered
the Columbia River?

370
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:07,792
Here's our outfit.

371
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:10,386
Mr. Coleman, this is my sister Ruth.
Robert Gray.

372
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:14,345
Honey Girl, it isn't safe to
be sitting in a rocking chair,

373
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:16,972
when there are
certain persons present.

374
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:20,225
I think you'll find
we have everything.

375
00:21:20,304 --> 00:21:21,681
Plenty of guns?

376
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:25,064
A rifle and a fowling piece.

377
00:21:25,142 --> 00:21:26,439
How about ammunition?

378
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,771
Plenty.

379
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:34,318
One thing...
I don't see any barrel.

380
00:21:34,402 --> 00:21:35,403
A barrel?

381
00:21:35,486 --> 00:21:37,238
Yeah, you'll need
a water barrel.

382
00:21:37,321 --> 00:21:39,039
There'll be long
stretches without water.

383
00:21:39,115 --> 00:21:41,709
I knew we'd forget something.
I'll go get one.

384
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:44,253
All right.

385
00:21:44,328 --> 00:21:47,707
What I was aiming to tell you was this.
When I came in...

386
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,043
The folks right next
there had an extra one.

387
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:52,345
Oh, quick work, son.

388
00:21:56,257 --> 00:21:59,261
Say, it wouldn't be a bad
idea to take two barrels.

389
00:21:59,343 --> 00:22:01,141
Suppose you go
rustle another one.

390
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,972
I'll do that.

391
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,563
When I came romping into
the Riggses' cabin, ma'am...

392
00:22:06,642 --> 00:22:08,736
How's this one?

393
00:22:08,811 --> 00:22:10,905
Oh! Well, that's fine.

394
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,075
Looks like barrels
grow on trees around here.

395
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:24,369
Mr. Cameron, you better tell your
sister to change that pretty dress.

396
00:22:24,452 --> 00:22:26,375
She won't get
very far in that.

397
00:22:26,454 --> 00:22:27,546
Yes, sir.

398
00:22:27,621 --> 00:22:29,623
Put on some
traveling clothes.

399
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:31,175
Let's have
a peek around here.

400
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,672
We have a trailer,

401
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:34,971
in case we needed...

402
00:22:35,045 --> 00:22:38,015
I like him better
than Mr. Thorpe.

403
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,843
Honey Girl, we'll finish
your history lesson.

404
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:42,765
Ah, I know how that is.

405
00:22:42,845 --> 00:22:44,222
Well, you won't...

406
00:22:44,305 --> 00:22:46,228
Thorpe!

407
00:22:46,307 --> 00:22:50,858
<i>Thorpe, you get back on the Peensie
Bell and make yourself scarce.</i>

408
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,530
If you're here when
the boat pulls out,

409
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:57,452
the boys will certainly lead
your pony out from under you.

410
00:22:57,526 --> 00:23:00,951
Why, I had no
intention of staying.

411
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,124
<i>I'll be on the Peensie Bell
when she leaves.</i>

412
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:05,247
You see that you are.

413
00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:14,298
My goodness. I don't know what
I'm going to do with you.

414
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:18,381
Well, I try again. Come on.
Here. Up you go. Up.

415
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:21,138
Oh, you stubborn jackass. I
give you a "yab" in the "yaw."

416
00:23:21,217 --> 00:23:22,844
I bet you "yump." Come on.

417
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:23,974
Up.

418
00:23:24,053 --> 00:23:27,353
Hello there, Gus. What do you
call that thing you got there?

419
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:29,183
Oh, his name is Jack.

420
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:31,815
Jack? Oh, yes.
But that's only half of it.

421
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:34,488
Well, see,
he's only a half a horse.

422
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:37,157
Well...What's the matter?
Can't you get him up?

423
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:39,861
I don't know. I pull and I
pull, but he won't come up.

424
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,868
Wait. Wait. I got an idea.

425
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:47,792
Say, what did you
say to him then?

426
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:50,959
Heh! I told him a joke
about my mother-in-law.

427
00:23:52,122 --> 00:23:53,248
Gus!

428
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:54,424
Wait. Shh. Here she comes.

429
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,878
Gus, what have
you got there?

430
00:23:56,961 --> 00:23:59,134
This is my new horse.
I just bought him.

431
00:23:59,213 --> 00:24:01,136
You bought him?
Sure.

432
00:24:01,215 --> 00:24:03,013
Say, ya...

433
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:09,940
That wasn't me, Mama.
No, it was the mule.

434
00:24:13,602 --> 00:24:15,229
That rum's
for you and me, eh?

435
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:16,438
<i>Ah, gracias.</i>

436
00:24:21,944 --> 00:24:23,946
Ahh.

437
00:24:26,115 --> 00:24:30,996
Well, if it ain't Bill Thorpe, eh?

438
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:36,255
I always thought you was
hung and planted years back.

439
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,051
No, my time ain't
arrived yet, Flack.

440
00:24:38,127 --> 00:24:39,174
Yeah.

441
00:24:39,253 --> 00:24:41,381
Though it looks as though
it might be drawing close.

442
00:24:41,463 --> 00:24:43,431
Ah, how come?

443
00:24:43,507 --> 00:24:45,509
Well, I've been
promised a hanging bee

444
00:24:45,593 --> 00:24:47,516
<i>if I don't get out
on the Peensie Bell.</i>

445
00:24:47,595 --> 00:24:51,395
And the captain promised me a necktie
party if I set foot on the boat.

446
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,601
It's a case
of nowhere to go.

447
00:24:53,684 --> 00:24:57,188
Yeah. It appears to me you do
your shooting by daylight,

448
00:24:57,271 --> 00:25:02,152
with too many people looking on, eh?

449
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:06,580
Well, long as you can't go
and you can't stay,

450
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:10,285
just what do you figure
to do about it, eh?

451
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:12,335
Well, I've always been
able to wiggle out.

452
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:16,461
Yeah. Appears to me as if you
was born to be drowned, eh?

453
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:25,049
Come on, Zeke.
Get rid of that moonshine,

454
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:26,600
and let's get out
in the sunshine.

455
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:28,097
All right, big boy.

456
00:25:28,177 --> 00:25:30,100
Hold your head up.
Don't leave me.

457
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:33,149
Yeah, so long, folks.
See you next year.

458
00:25:33,223 --> 00:25:35,317
Yeah.

459
00:25:41,023 --> 00:25:45,950
Are you just as handy
with a gun as you was?

460
00:25:47,488 --> 00:25:49,741
I can drive
a nail at 30 paces.

461
00:25:49,823 --> 00:25:50,995
Yeah.

462
00:25:51,075 --> 00:25:54,750
Well, as long
as you can't go,

463
00:25:54,828 --> 00:25:59,299
and you can't stay...

464
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:04,256
Wouldn't be a bad idea if you
was to go along with me.

465
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,382
Well, that sounds reasonable.
Yeah.

466
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:08,388
Where do you happen
to be headed for?

467
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:11,346
Well, anyways,
it's out there,

468
00:26:11,428 --> 00:26:14,728
where there ain't no noose
awaitin' for you, eh?

469
00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:18,815
Hello, Breck.

470
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:21,522
Well, Windy, I trapped
him with his jug down at Joe's.

471
00:26:21,605 --> 00:26:23,653
Hey, Windy, here's the last

472
00:26:23,732 --> 00:26:27,032
you'll see of civilization
for a long time.

473
00:26:27,111 --> 00:26:28,237
That's worth tryin'.

474
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,243
Hey! Back up here,
will ya? Back up.

475
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,326
I gotta finish
that with Windy.

476
00:26:36,245 --> 00:26:39,590
Hey, that's what you get
for not drinkin' with me.

477
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:40,712
I'll drink at your
next wedding.

478
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:41,838
Yeah!

479
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:43,840
Windy, uh...

480
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,513
Do some of them musical things,
will you, with your mouth?

481
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:48,556
Ah, that's old stuff.

482
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,847
Dab, no. Something new.

483
00:26:50,926 --> 00:26:51,973
Oh, well.

484
00:26:52,052 --> 00:26:53,019
A coyote.

485
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,476
That's no coyote.

486
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,688
There's the stuff! Hey!

487
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:01,896
Hey, did you
ever kill a dead Indian?

488
00:27:01,979 --> 00:27:03,276
No, I never killed
a dead one.

489
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:06,108
Before they
was dead, did ya?

490
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:09,070
No. You see, the Injuns
are my friends.

491
00:27:09,153 --> 00:27:11,952
They taught me all I know
about the woods.

492
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:15,251
They taught me how to follow a
trail by watching the leaves.

493
00:27:15,325 --> 00:27:16,702
And how to cut
your mark on a tree

494
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:19,208
so you won't get lost
in the forest.

495
00:27:19,288 --> 00:27:21,382
And they taught me how
to burry in in the snow,

496
00:27:21,457 --> 00:27:23,630
so you won't freeze
to death in the storms.

497
00:27:24,126 --> 00:27:26,925
And they taught me how to make
a fire without even a flint.

498
00:27:27,004 --> 00:27:28,927
How could you do that?

499
00:27:29,006 --> 00:27:31,634
And they taught me how to make
the best bow and arrows too.

500
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:34,391
Did they teach you
how to make papooses?

501
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:37,269
No, that's
one of their own secrets.

502
00:27:38,307 --> 00:27:40,935
Well, boys, I guess
we better get going.

503
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,029
O God, our Father,

504
00:27:52,112 --> 00:27:55,491
as you sit on high and look
down on us poor mortals,

505
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:57,497
forgive our frailties.

506
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:59,670
I am about to
lead these people

507
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:02,464
into a wild and
dangerous country.

508
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:07,215
Give me strength and wisdom,
0 God, to lead them through.

509
00:28:10,506 --> 00:28:11,723
Where's my steps?

510
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:14,097
Mama, I got everything
packed up in the wagon.

511
00:28:14,176 --> 00:28:16,178
But how can I get
into the wagon, you idiot?

512
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,980
Well, look, I show you. Look,
Mama, put your feets up on there.

513
00:28:19,056 --> 00:28:22,026
That's it. Now wait. I lift. That's...
Up you go, Mama. That's it.

514
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:25,105
Now one more foot up. Now up, Mama.
Up, Mama. That's it. Up.

515
00:28:25,187 --> 00:28:28,066
Wait, Mama. You're sitting
on my head, Mama.

516
00:28:28,148 --> 00:28:30,071
Please... There you go.

517
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,744
Get in. Get in, folks.
We're goin'.

518
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,164
Mount up. We're goin' now.
Get in there.

519
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,378
We're on our way.

520
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:50,429
Pull out!

521
00:28:52,714 --> 00:28:53,715
Give us a song!

522
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:54,800
All right.

523
00:28:54,883 --> 00:28:55,884
We're off, boys.

524
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,470
<i>Sam's got a wooden
leg below the knee</i>

525
00:28:57,553 --> 00:29:00,022
<i>Sam's got a wooden leg
below the knee</i>

526
00:29:03,517 --> 00:29:05,565
Whoa, mule!

527
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:10,528
Never mind! I
walk there, Useless. Come on.

528
00:29:15,445 --> 00:29:17,948
You want these sacks,
don't ya?

529
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,832
Trade cattle.

530
00:29:52,441 --> 00:29:55,240
Hyah! Hyah!

531
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:16,549
About time we were movin' on.

532
00:30:16,632 --> 00:30:18,100
Yeah.

533
00:30:21,303 --> 00:30:23,305
Willy!

534
00:30:24,973 --> 00:30:29,103
Come on, Willy. Forward!

535
00:30:53,627 --> 00:30:55,049
Ah, giddyap!

536
00:30:56,588 --> 00:31:00,718
Ah, giddyap!
Ah, giddyap!

537
00:31:06,556 --> 00:31:09,730
Hyah! Hyah! Move out!

538
00:31:13,063 --> 00:31:14,690
Yeah! Yee!

539
00:31:44,928 --> 00:31:49,229
You make me so tired!
Get over there!

540
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:50,480
I'm tired of this!

541
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,277
Fi!

542
00:31:52,352 --> 00:31:54,354
Get up here!

543
00:31:56,023 --> 00:31:57,946
Get along here!

544
00:31:58,025 --> 00:32:02,155
Get in there!
Get on! Go on!

545
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,661
Howdy, Dave.

546
00:32:09,745 --> 00:32:10,871
Hello, Coleman.

547
00:32:10,954 --> 00:32:13,503
Oh, Miss Cameron...

548
00:32:13,582 --> 00:32:17,337
Glad to see you took my advice
about saving that pretty dress.

549
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:22,383
You look so nice in it,
it'd be a shame to spoil it.

550
00:32:36,772 --> 00:32:39,321
Looking for
anyone in particular?

551
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:42,448
Honey Girl,
a gentleman never comes

552
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:45,280
to a lady's home
when he isn't wanted.

553
00:32:45,364 --> 00:32:49,619
Out here, this wagon's
our only home.

554
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,295
Pony, that means us.

555
00:32:54,414 --> 00:32:56,257
Come on, Useless.
What's the matter?

556
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:58,176
Come here, Useless.

557
00:32:58,251 --> 00:33:00,299
Hey, there.

558
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:01,881
Whoa! Wait. Wait.

559
00:33:03,507 --> 00:33:05,054
Whoa.

560
00:33:05,133 --> 00:33:07,477
Get in...
Get in there.

561
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:11,102
Get in there!
Giddyap!

562
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:12,273
Whoa.

563
00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:15,853
Come on. Get in there!

564
00:33:15,936 --> 00:33:19,816
Come on, Useless.
This way.

565
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:21,821
Git!

566
00:33:24,653 --> 00:33:27,076
Whoa.
Wait a minute, Useless.

567
00:33:30,784 --> 00:33:33,833
Come on, Useless.
Come on, Useless. Come on.

568
00:33:36,164 --> 00:33:39,043
What do you think
of this fella Thorpe?

569
00:33:39,126 --> 00:33:44,428
Ah, I've seen that there
squawker somewheres afore.

570
00:33:44,506 --> 00:33:46,804
Can't recollect just where.

571
00:33:46,883 --> 00:33:51,434
He, uh, shoots a kind of a nasty
look at you once in a while, boy.

572
00:33:51,513 --> 00:33:53,231
We had a run-in
the first day.

573
00:33:53,306 --> 00:33:54,933
Yeah?

574
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:56,017
You know,
he ain't no settler.

575
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:57,273
Nah.

576
00:33:57,352 --> 00:33:58,604
And he ain't no bullwhacker.

577
00:33:58,687 --> 00:33:59,813
Uh-uh.

578
00:33:59,896 --> 00:34:01,819
Wonder what
he come along for.

579
00:34:01,898 --> 00:34:06,779
Aha! He come along, uh, 'cause
of that, uh, Cameron girl.

580
00:34:06,862 --> 00:34:09,160
I'm still mystified,
Mr. Thorpe,

581
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:13,119
why you came here instead of
returning to your plantation.

582
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:15,420
I've told you why I came.

583
00:34:15,495 --> 00:34:18,214
I induced Captain Hollister,
an old friend of mine,

584
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,635
to put back to shore,
and I followed you.

585
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,633
Yes, I know that's
what you told me.

586
00:34:23,712 --> 00:34:25,464
But I'm afraid
you're a flatterer.

587
00:34:25,547 --> 00:34:28,642
Oh! On my honor, no.

588
00:34:28,717 --> 00:34:31,596
You got a chew of tobacco?

589
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:38,944
Hey, Lopez! Tobacco's gonna
be mighty scarce later on.

590
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:45,864
Boy, I'm goin' back to old Windy
Bill and get a slug of "come on."

591
00:34:47,736 --> 00:34:49,409
Your name's Lopez, eh?

592
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:51,582
Uh, Lopez, that's me.

593
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,624
You and Flack good friends,
he tells me.

594
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,455
Ah, Flack and me
been friends 12, 15 years.

595
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,003
You were out wolfing
together last winter, eh?

596
00:35:01,082 --> 00:35:04,882
No, no, no. Wolfing, she not
good business. No money.

597
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:06,133
Then you didn't get many?

598
00:35:06,213 --> 00:35:08,557
No, not much.

599
00:35:08,632 --> 00:35:10,509
Funny. Wellmore said
you sold him

600
00:35:10,592 --> 00:35:12,845
more furs than any other
half dozen outfits.

601
00:35:12,928 --> 00:35:16,933
No. He must have been talking
about someone else. Not me.

602
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:20,019
Well, no matter.
See you often.

603
00:35:22,896 --> 00:35:25,524
Ah, you rascal.

604
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:26,608
Flack.

605
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:33,206
Got a good bunch
of bullwhackers, Flack.

606
00:35:35,492 --> 00:35:38,086
That, uh, Lopez
strikes me as a good hand.

607
00:35:38,161 --> 00:35:42,132
Ah, you bet.
Lopez can pound them along.

608
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:44,460
You and him old friends, eh?

609
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:47,547
Who? Lopez and me?

610
00:35:47,629 --> 00:35:52,385
Nah. I never see'd him
till he signed on this trip.

611
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:56,347
My mistake.

612
00:35:58,056 --> 00:36:00,058
Ah, Lopez.

613
00:36:00,141 --> 00:36:01,438
I don't like
this man Coleman.

614
00:36:01,518 --> 00:36:02,644
Yeah?

615
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:07,946
If he asks after me, you
tell him you never see'd me,

616
00:36:08,024 --> 00:36:10,152
till you signed on this trip.

617
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:11,282
You're too late.

618
00:36:11,361 --> 00:36:12,408
Why?

619
00:36:12,487 --> 00:36:16,082
He just speak to me, and I
tell him we was old friends.

620
00:36:16,157 --> 00:36:18,080
What?

621
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:21,959
What do you use under your
hat instead of brains?

622
00:36:22,038 --> 00:36:25,838
You need no brains
if you got this.

623
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:29,217
Ahh.
Now you're talking sense.

624
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,858
Come on, you.
Come on. Giddyap.

625
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:51,368
<i>Pick your partner
and a-promenade back.</i>

626
00:36:55,196 --> 00:36:58,040
<i>First couple out to the right
and follow the ca...</i>

627
00:37:08,877 --> 00:37:11,255
Prepare to promenade back.

628
00:37:14,716 --> 00:37:17,219
First couple out to the right
and follow the call.

629
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:33,944
Now right in circles.

630
00:37:41,451 --> 00:37:44,751
Take your partner
and a-promenade back.

631
00:37:47,582 --> 00:37:49,835
First couple out to the right
and follow the call.

632
00:37:49,918 --> 00:37:53,047
Maybe she won't, uh,
talk with him,

633
00:37:53,129 --> 00:37:56,224
but she'll dance
with him, eh?

634
00:37:57,425 --> 00:37:58,972
It's a lovely dance.

635
00:37:59,052 --> 00:38:00,554
On with the next
and follow the call.

636
00:38:00,637 --> 00:38:03,015
And a lovely night.

637
00:38:03,098 --> 00:38:05,226
And a lovely girl.

638
00:38:05,308 --> 00:38:09,609
Now's your chance. Go in and
snag her away from him.

639
00:38:17,237 --> 00:38:18,534
I claim the favor.

640
00:38:18,613 --> 00:38:20,957
With pleasure, Mr. Thorpe.

641
00:38:27,497 --> 00:38:28,544
Well, Zeke.

642
00:38:28,623 --> 00:38:29,670
Hello, boy.

643
00:38:29,749 --> 00:38:32,628
Thorpe just stole my partner and
left me dancing with myself.

644
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:34,054
Yeah?

645
00:38:34,295 --> 00:38:37,424
Say, boy, it just come to me
a minute ago,

646
00:38:37,507 --> 00:38:39,225
where I seen that
there Thorpe before.

647
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,301
Where?

648
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:44,356
Camped on the Cimarron with
Flack and Lopez. They're old friends.

649
00:38:44,431 --> 00:38:46,183
Are you sure of that?
Dead certain.

650
00:38:46,266 --> 00:38:49,361
So keep your eye
peeled on him, son.

651
00:38:49,436 --> 00:38:53,532
Oh, I'm tired. I think
I'll go to my wagon.

652
00:38:53,606 --> 00:38:56,701
Why, certainly.
Let me take you there.

653
00:39:02,323 --> 00:39:04,576
And to think this
same moon is shining

654
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:07,378
on my old plantation
in Louisiana.

655
00:39:20,008 --> 00:39:23,387
All it needs is a lovely
woman to preside there.

656
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,268
Someday you'll find her.

657
00:39:25,346 --> 00:39:27,064
I have found her, Ruth.

658
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,734
Oh, please, Mr. Thorpe.
Look, I've told you before

659
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:32,608
that there can be
no happiness without love.

660
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:34,610
But love will come.

661
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,213
Ruth... I'm really
tired, Mr. Thorpe.

662
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:57,717
Do you mind if I go to bed?
Good night.

663
00:39:57,796 --> 00:39:59,389
Good night.

664
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:25,289
We're getting into
dangerous country, Flack...

665
00:40:25,365 --> 00:40:28,665
So I'll be riding to the Pawnee
villages to pick up some Injun scouts.

666
00:40:28,743 --> 00:40:33,499
Yes? Well, you're likely to
lose your scalp out there.

667
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:37,336
I'll bet you a couple of wolf
pelts I bring it back with me.

668
00:40:40,421 --> 00:40:43,095
How long'll you
be gone, Coleman?

669
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,222
Three or four days,
a week maybe.

670
00:40:45,301 --> 00:40:47,303
Oh, back so soon?

671
00:40:47,387 --> 00:40:49,685
I thought maybe you wouldn't
be coming back at all.

672
00:40:49,764 --> 00:40:52,108
And just why did
you think that?

673
00:40:54,143 --> 00:40:59,866
Well, after I sort of took the
dark-eyed beauty away from you,

674
00:40:59,941 --> 00:41:02,319
I thought you
might be decamping.

675
00:41:05,488 --> 00:41:10,369
Listen, Thorpe. I never quit a
job in the middle of the road.

676
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:12,795
Oh, quite so.
Quite so.

677
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:15,294
But after the girl quit you
in the middle of the road...

678
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:17,626
Say that again, Mr. Thorpe!

679
00:41:21,129 --> 00:41:23,757
I know who you are now,

680
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,684
and I know why you quit
the Cimarron country too.

681
00:41:28,344 --> 00:41:31,518
Oh, well. No necessity to
have quarrels among friends.

682
00:41:31,598 --> 00:41:36,274
Friends?
You threw too wide a loop.

683
00:41:36,352 --> 00:41:40,482
Remember this,
the three of you...

684
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:42,988
I'm not your friend.

685
00:41:50,533 --> 00:41:55,414
Yeah. Well, you let him
scare you stiff.

686
00:41:55,496 --> 00:41:57,419
Not at all.

687
00:41:57,498 --> 00:41:59,876
Only an idiot, you know,
presses a quarrel,

688
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:02,633
when the other man has a knife
pressed against his middle.

689
00:42:02,712 --> 00:42:05,090
Yeah. Good excuse.

690
00:42:05,173 --> 00:42:07,892
Wolf pelts, eh?

691
00:42:07,967 --> 00:42:08,968
What does that mean?

692
00:42:09,052 --> 00:42:10,224
Don't mean nothin'.

693
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,647
It doesn't to me,
but it does to you.

694
00:42:12,722 --> 00:42:14,770
Yeah? Where'd you get
that notion?

695
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:16,146
When he mentioned
wolf pelts, you looked

696
00:42:16,225 --> 00:42:18,319
as though he'd rammed
a knife in you.

697
00:42:18,394 --> 00:42:21,364
Not exactly
what I'd call a poker face.

698
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:24,659
Yeah?
Well, what of it?

699
00:42:24,734 --> 00:42:27,157
Oh, nothing.

700
00:42:27,236 --> 00:42:31,787
Only I'm beginning to understand
why you don't like Coleman.

701
00:42:35,703 --> 00:42:37,626
Bye, Windy.

702
00:42:37,705 --> 00:42:40,959
And, Zeke, I'll be seeing you in the
happy hunting grounds if not before.

703
00:42:41,042 --> 00:42:42,168
Good luck, boy.

704
00:42:42,251 --> 00:42:43,377
Bye.

705
00:42:44,879 --> 00:42:48,554
Well, Miss Ruth, I got
some good news for you.

706
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:49,850
What?

707
00:42:49,926 --> 00:42:53,476
I'm gonna be away for a while.
I'm going scoutin'.

708
00:42:53,554 --> 00:42:56,558
Well, isn't that dangerous
in the open country?

709
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:59,360
Lord, no. I love it...

710
00:42:59,435 --> 00:43:04,032
Especially now that it's spring
and everything's so happy.

711
00:43:04,107 --> 00:43:08,328
Why, there's trees
out there, big, tall pines...

712
00:43:08,403 --> 00:43:10,576
Just a-reachin'
and a-reachin'...

713
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:13,204
As if they wanted to climb right
through the gates of heaven.

714
00:43:13,908 --> 00:43:19,165
And there's brooks, too, with
the water smiling all day long.

715
00:43:19,247 --> 00:43:22,501
But the part I like best
is the night...

716
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:25,837
Lying out there beneath
a blanket of stars,

717
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,424
with that old moon
smiling down on you.

718
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:33,182
And every time you look up,
there she is,

719
00:43:33,261 --> 00:43:37,858
sort of guarding over you, like
a mother minding her young.

720
00:43:39,642 --> 00:43:44,819
Sometimes it's so beautiful that
I just lie there, listening.

721
00:43:44,897 --> 00:43:49,653
Birds singing,
brooks laughing,

722
00:43:49,736 --> 00:43:53,206
and the wind sort of
crooning through the forest.

723
00:43:53,281 --> 00:43:56,581
Like some great organ.

724
00:43:56,659 --> 00:43:58,878
Oh, I've always loved it.

725
00:44:01,122 --> 00:44:03,716
But I reckon I'm gonna be
lonely this time.

726
00:44:05,793 --> 00:44:10,469
You know, you can get sort of used
to having somebody not like you.

727
00:44:12,133 --> 00:44:17,014
And when they're not around,
you miss them not liking you.

728
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:21,560
That's why I reckon
I'm gonna be lonesome.

729
00:44:22,602 --> 00:44:25,401
But I'll be thinking of you.

730
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,482
Good-bye.

731
00:44:31,152 --> 00:44:34,247
And you just take care
you don't lose your scalp!

732
00:44:34,322 --> 00:44:36,245
Zeke, is he leaving
the train?

733
00:44:36,324 --> 00:44:38,418
Yes, miss. He's riding out
to Pawnee villages.

734
00:44:38,493 --> 00:44:39,836
Well, how far are they?

735
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:42,209
Oh, nigh on a hundred mile.

736
00:44:42,622 --> 00:44:43,965
Well, isn't that dangerous?

737
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,715
Well, he's likely to lose his
scalp afore he gets there.

738
00:44:47,794 --> 00:44:49,967
But once in the villages,
he's safe.

739
00:44:50,046 --> 00:44:52,299
So don't you
worry about him, miss.

740
00:44:52,381 --> 00:44:54,884
What... Why should
I worry about him?

741
00:44:54,967 --> 00:44:57,311
I don't know, miss.
I don't know.

742
00:44:57,595 --> 00:44:59,939
But seemed like as
if maybe you was.

743
00:45:00,014 --> 00:45:01,891
Oh, not at all.
He means nothing to me.

744
00:45:01,974 --> 00:45:05,854
No. No, in course not.
Good night.

745
00:45:06,562 --> 00:45:08,360
Good night, Zeke.

746
00:45:20,868 --> 00:45:23,621
Hey! You got back
here at last, eh?

747
00:45:23,704 --> 00:45:27,129
Yeah. There's plenty of
buffalo sign out here,

748
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:29,427
so I'll be riding out
to pick up fresh meat.

749
00:45:29,502 --> 00:45:31,675
Ah, well, who's keeping you?

750
00:45:31,754 --> 00:45:33,802
I'll see you at
the river crossing.

751
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:44,230
Lopez! Lopez! Thorpe!
Pull up here. Come here.

752
00:45:46,769 --> 00:45:50,649
You two have been waiting
for your chance. Here it is.

753
00:45:50,731 --> 00:45:52,483
Go out on a buffalo hunt.

754
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:54,285
Me? Nah.

755
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,330
I kill hundreds of buffalo.
Why should I go?

756
00:45:57,405 --> 00:45:59,658
Ah! Get them cobwebs
out of your brain!

757
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:03,085
He means, Lopez,
we might find better game.

758
00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:17,225
Watch him till
he leaves the Pawnees,

759
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,769
and then give it
to him in the back.

760
00:46:19,844 --> 00:46:21,846
Go on.

761
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:58,406
Hey, you pilgrims!
Come here! Come here!

762
00:47:58,693 --> 00:48:00,366
Bascom?
Yes!

763
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:01,946
Bascom!
Yes.

764
00:48:02,029 --> 00:48:05,909
I'll shove the horses and
the cattle right on through.

765
00:48:05,992 --> 00:48:08,620
Leave only the wheelers
hooked to the wagons.

766
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:10,797
Once you take to the water...

767
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:15,672
Well, it's every man and critter
for hisself, eh?

768
00:48:15,751 --> 00:48:17,469
Get out of here!
Get out of here! Go on!

769
00:48:17,545 --> 00:48:18,717
Mr. Flack.

770
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:22,300
Mr. Flack, how can I get
my mule Useless across?

771
00:48:22,383 --> 00:48:26,058
Well, uh, get your
mother-in-law to ride him, eh?

772
00:48:26,137 --> 00:48:27,980
Mr. Bascom.
Yes?

773
00:48:28,055 --> 00:48:29,853
Mr. Bascom, you know,
I don't like that fella.

774
00:48:29,932 --> 00:48:30,979
No?

775
00:48:31,058 --> 00:48:33,527
He's the kind who will pat you
on your back to your face,

776
00:48:33,602 --> 00:48:35,275
and then laughs in your face
behind your back.

777
00:48:35,354 --> 00:48:36,321
Yeah.

778
00:48:36,397 --> 00:48:37,614
And another thing.
Yes?

779
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:41,411
If he had a mother-in-law like
mine, he would never laugh.

780
00:48:48,743 --> 00:48:51,337
The hunt was a great success.

781
00:48:51,412 --> 00:48:52,629
We bagged our buffalo.

782
00:48:52,705 --> 00:48:54,503
Hey.

783
00:48:54,582 --> 00:48:57,506
Did you get your meat, eh?

784
00:48:59,795 --> 00:49:02,674
Ah, good. Good!

785
00:49:02,757 --> 00:49:05,055
Well, we'd better
shove on off then.

786
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:32,164
Boots off.

787
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:39,334
I see you took a bath.

788
00:51:39,413 --> 00:51:42,337
Uh, yeah, yeah.

789
00:51:42,416 --> 00:51:45,260
Is there... ls there
a slug of whiskey?

790
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:49,682
No, I left my jug... I hid
it in the Camerons' wagon.

791
00:51:49,757 --> 00:51:51,680
By the way,
where is my little beauty?

792
00:51:51,759 --> 00:51:55,138
Well, she's, uh...
She's somewheres around.

793
00:51:55,221 --> 00:51:58,646
Well, now that you've
got her all to yourself,

794
00:51:58,724 --> 00:52:00,647
what do you aim
to do with her?

795
00:52:00,726 --> 00:52:03,900
I think I'll take her back
and settle on my plantation.

796
00:52:03,979 --> 00:52:08,530
Your... Your plantation, eh?

797
00:52:09,109 --> 00:52:14,741
Lopez, he's hollered so much about
that there plantation of his,

798
00:52:14,823 --> 00:52:17,702
he believes it hisself, eh?

799
00:52:17,785 --> 00:52:20,834
<i>What? The Señor Thorpe,
he have no plantation?</i>

800
00:52:20,913 --> 00:52:22,915
Plantation! Ha!

801
00:52:23,207 --> 00:52:27,132
All you got in the world
is a dirty deck of cards

802
00:52:27,586 --> 00:52:29,213
and a crooked one at that.

803
00:52:29,296 --> 00:52:30,548
Zeke.
Yeah?

804
00:52:30,631 --> 00:52:32,429
Coleman's been gone two days.

805
00:52:32,508 --> 00:52:35,011
Yeah. I've been kinda
worried about that myself.

806
00:52:44,645 --> 00:52:48,525
Eagle Tail says last time he seen
him, he was headed for the train.

807
00:52:48,607 --> 00:52:51,736
Well, another thing, the
Camerons haven't crossed yet.

808
00:52:51,819 --> 00:52:53,913
No. I better
saunter on down there

809
00:52:53,988 --> 00:52:55,240
and see what's
holdin' 'em, huh?

810
00:52:55,322 --> 00:52:57,416
Yes. We'd better
help 'em across.

811
00:52:57,491 --> 00:52:59,164
Yeah. Go on.

812
00:53:03,872 --> 00:53:05,966
Well, I think we can...

813
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:08,294
We were just wondering
what had become of you.

814
00:53:08,377 --> 00:53:09,845
Where's your horse?

815
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,345
He stepped in a prairie-dog
hole and broke his neck.

816
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:14,676
Come near
breakin' mine too.

817
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:15,975
Are you hurt?

818
00:53:16,051 --> 00:53:19,100
No. I was knocked out
for a spell.

819
00:53:19,179 --> 00:53:22,479
Here, I'll put these in your
wagon and help you across.

820
00:53:22,558 --> 00:53:25,186
Flack said we could
only use the wheelers.

821
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:27,863
Flack said? What does
he know about water?

822
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:30,361
He never took
a bath in his life.

823
00:53:37,489 --> 00:53:39,833
Shortie!

824
00:53:42,745 --> 00:53:45,419
There's the Cameron wagon.

825
00:53:51,337 --> 00:53:53,305
I'll go greet
the little filly.

826
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,303
Greet, eh?

827
00:53:55,382 --> 00:54:00,058
Well, Lopez and me
will go greet a jug.

828
00:54:01,764 --> 00:54:04,734
Whoa!

829
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:07,436
You take 'em from here on in, Dave.
It's shallow water.

830
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:09,271
All right, Breck. I'll go
back and get my saddle.

831
00:54:09,355 --> 00:54:11,357
All right.

832
00:54:13,901 --> 00:54:16,279
Giddyap!
Come on, Shortie!

833
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:19,823
Come on!

834
00:54:21,617 --> 00:54:25,463
Come on, Shortie!
Come on! Get up there!

835
00:54:25,537 --> 00:54:27,335
Whoa! Whoa!

836
00:54:28,415 --> 00:54:30,338
I was just coming over to help you.

837
00:54:30,417 --> 00:54:32,511
Thank you.
We had the best of help.

838
00:54:32,586 --> 00:54:34,588
Help? Who?

839
00:54:39,259 --> 00:54:41,682
What's the matter, Lopez?
Seein' a few ghosts?

840
00:54:41,762 --> 00:54:43,685
Me? No, no.

841
00:54:49,436 --> 00:54:51,359
Drive on into
the corral, Dave.

842
00:54:51,438 --> 00:54:52,530
All right.

843
00:54:52,606 --> 00:54:55,485
Giddyap! Come on there!
Get up there!

844
00:54:55,567 --> 00:54:57,569
Pull on up!

845
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:03,914
I'll be seeing you three later
about matters and things.

846
00:55:16,547 --> 00:55:17,844
Why, hello, boy.

847
00:55:17,923 --> 00:55:19,175
Howdy, Zeke.

848
00:55:19,258 --> 00:55:20,475
Why, what happened?

849
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:22,269
Pony stepped in a dog hole.

850
00:55:22,344 --> 00:55:25,894
Yeah? I suppose a prairie dog shot
that hole through your saddle

851
00:55:25,973 --> 00:55:28,271
and into your horse, eh?

852
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,352
Natchie!

853
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,039
Who was gone
from camp, Zeke?

854
00:55:43,115 --> 00:55:45,743
Thorpe and Lopez
come in during the night,

855
00:55:45,826 --> 00:55:49,296
and early morning, sent a
wagon out for the meat.

856
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:57,468
Well, a nice
mess you made of things.

857
00:55:57,546 --> 00:55:59,548
Not at all!

858
00:56:00,591 --> 00:56:04,095
Two hundred yards running is
considerable of a handicap.

859
00:56:04,178 --> 00:56:07,182
Besides,
other days are coming.

860
00:56:07,264 --> 00:56:09,642
Well, don't you
fool yourself.

861
00:56:09,725 --> 00:56:11,853
Here he is, here
he is, here he is.

862
00:56:13,687 --> 00:56:16,190
Flack, the Injuns
been sending up

863
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:17,775
smoke signals
for several days.

864
00:56:17,858 --> 00:56:19,952
Yes, well, I seen 'em.

865
00:56:20,027 --> 00:56:22,951
I'll skirmish around with the
Pawnees for a few miles.

866
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:25,704
Well, go on. There ain't
no one keeping you!

867
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:28,878
No, but you'd better keep
Thorpe and Lopez here.

868
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:30,875
Why?

869
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:34,709
I got a feeling that if either
one of 'em leaves camp,

870
00:56:35,709 --> 00:56:37,632
they'll never come back.

871
00:56:37,711 --> 00:56:39,634
What do you mean by that?

872
00:56:39,713 --> 00:56:41,465
Just the way it sounded.

873
00:56:41,548 --> 00:56:43,801
Hey, look there.
Look there, eh?

874
00:56:47,221 --> 00:56:48,393
Injuns?

875
00:56:54,061 --> 00:56:57,907
Lopez, fire
a long shot at 'em.

876
00:56:57,981 --> 00:56:59,733
No fire!

877
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:05,330
They're Cheyennes.
They want to palaver.

878
00:57:05,405 --> 00:57:08,079
Ah, they look to me
as if they're out for harm.

879
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:10,707
They will be if
we take a shot at 'em.

880
00:57:10,786 --> 00:57:13,790
That'll mean war. I'll go
out and palaver with them.

881
00:57:13,872 --> 00:57:17,877
Go on. Go on. Maybe
so you no come back, huh?

882
00:57:20,045 --> 00:57:21,797
Look how queerly
his horse is acting.

883
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,598
Yeah. He's riding zigzag.

884
00:57:23,674 --> 00:57:26,848
That's Indian sign
that he wants to palaver.

885
00:57:30,806 --> 00:57:34,151
There's the chief riding out
to meet him now for a powwow.

886
00:58:05,507 --> 00:58:08,056
Zeke! Bascom!

887
00:58:17,853 --> 00:58:19,855
How.

888
00:58:21,648 --> 00:58:24,197
This is Black Elk,
an old friend of mine.

889
00:58:24,276 --> 00:58:27,075
Do they mean peace or war?

890
00:58:27,154 --> 00:58:29,703
Peace, if as long as we march
straight through the Cheyenne country

891
00:58:29,781 --> 00:58:31,829
without stopping to settle.

892
00:59:01,772 --> 00:59:03,945
Now that we're gonna be friends,

893
00:59:04,024 --> 00:59:06,743
they'll probably bring their
families over here to beg.

894
00:59:06,818 --> 00:59:09,617
So feed 'em well and treat 'em
right, and we'll have no trouble.

895
00:59:09,696 --> 00:59:10,788
All right.

896
00:59:10,864 --> 00:59:12,332
All right. Fine.

897
00:59:13,825 --> 00:59:14,872
No more
trouble now.

898
00:59:31,176 --> 00:59:34,931
Yes. Yes. Yes.

899
00:59:35,013 --> 00:59:37,015
Zeke, what's he
saying about me?

900
00:59:37,099 --> 00:59:40,353
He says that Coleman wants you
for his squaw.

901
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:43,313
Yes.

902
00:59:44,564 --> 00:59:48,410
Yes. And he says Flack
or Thorpe will get you.

903
00:59:48,485 --> 00:59:50,408
Flack or Thorpe? Why?
Yeah.

904
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:51,830
Well, Flack's got
a lot of horses.

905
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:15,183
Miss Ruth,
you shouldn't be riding out

906
01:00:15,262 --> 01:00:17,185
here alone like this
away from the train.

907
01:00:17,264 --> 01:00:18,811
Why not?

908
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:22,360
Because this is dangerous country
and anything might happen.

909
01:00:22,769 --> 01:00:24,567
You wouldn't care.

910
01:00:24,646 --> 01:00:26,398
Care? Me?

911
01:00:26,481 --> 01:00:28,404
Why should you care?

912
01:00:28,483 --> 01:00:31,077
Listen, girl,
if anything happened to you,

913
01:00:31,153 --> 01:00:33,155
it'd be like throwing
my heart to the wol...

914
01:00:33,238 --> 01:00:35,787
Oh, what...

915
01:00:35,866 --> 01:00:39,996
Don't worry. It's Black Elk
and some of his braves.

916
01:00:43,623 --> 01:00:46,092
Coleman squaw.
Coleman squaw.

917
01:00:46,168 --> 01:00:48,717
Well, he's saying
that I'm your squaw.

918
01:00:48,795 --> 01:00:50,718
Seems like that's
what he's driving at.

919
01:00:50,797 --> 01:00:53,300
Well, you tell him that you
don't want me for your squaw.

920
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:55,727
I've never told
Black Elk a lie yet.

921
01:00:55,802 --> 01:00:57,770
He knows my
tongue is straight.

922
01:00:57,846 --> 01:00:59,769
Well, what do you mean?

923
01:00:59,848 --> 01:01:02,897
Well, it wouldn't be true if I
told him I didn't want you.

924
01:01:02,976 --> 01:01:05,070
It happens I do.

925
01:01:05,145 --> 01:01:06,738
And you've
no better taste than

926
01:01:06,813 --> 01:01:09,407
to tell me that
before all these savages?

927
01:01:09,483 --> 01:01:12,487
I'd tell you that
in front of the whole world.

928
01:01:12,569 --> 01:01:15,413
This silly joke
has gone far enough.

929
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:49,944
Hey! Well,
there's one down anyway.

930
01:01:50,023 --> 01:01:52,776
Well, there's some more out there.
Let's go get 'em.

931
01:01:52,859 --> 01:01:54,827
All right, here we go.

932
01:01:58,031 --> 01:02:00,033
Here she goes!

933
01:02:00,117 --> 01:02:01,744
That's it.
That's it.

934
01:02:01,827 --> 01:02:03,374
Another one.

935
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:06,957
Get over there. Hey.

936
01:02:23,431 --> 01:02:25,433
Hey, there. Go on.

937
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:33,404
Yeah. Hope we land
in no trouble up ahead.

938
01:03:08,977 --> 01:03:10,524
Help those...
Help them take this stuff,

939
01:03:10,604 --> 01:03:12,777
the ones that are
going down.

940
01:03:23,992 --> 01:03:25,414
All right.
Hold tight.

941
01:03:25,493 --> 01:03:27,461
All right.

942
01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:31,383
Ah, you should be fine.

943
01:03:31,458 --> 01:03:33,460
Hang on, boy.

944
01:03:38,757 --> 01:03:41,260
You take Honey Girl
from here on down, Dave.

945
01:03:41,343 --> 01:03:42,560
It's a little easier going.

946
01:03:42,636 --> 01:03:44,604
Hold on.
All right, Breck.

947
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:45,680
Careful of her, Davey.

948
01:03:45,764 --> 01:03:47,937
Now, Miss Ruth,
you cling on to me.

949
01:03:48,016 --> 01:03:49,359
Put your arms around
my neck, Honey Girl.

950
01:03:49,434 --> 01:03:53,280
A little tighter.

951
01:03:55,774 --> 01:03:57,776
Just a little tighter.

952
01:04:17,087 --> 01:04:19,966
Let him down.
Come on, men.

953
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,849
Hurry up

954
01:04:25,929 --> 01:04:28,102
Hang on.
Let's take some in pairs.

955
01:04:43,405 --> 01:04:45,874
Are you all right, Honey Girl?

956
01:04:47,033 --> 01:04:49,456
It was a pretty bad place,
wasn't it, Breck?

957
01:04:49,536 --> 01:04:52,881
Yeah, but I sort of
liked it.

958
01:04:52,956 --> 01:04:55,175
Davey, let's see if our wagon's down yet.
Come on, Honey Girl.

959
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,252
Thank you, Breck.

960
01:04:59,254 --> 01:05:03,100
Well, well, well, well!

961
01:05:03,174 --> 01:05:05,051
So I've seen
that gal with her arms

962
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:07,979
around your neck at last.

963
01:05:08,054 --> 01:05:11,433
Yeah, but she sure unwrapped them
when she got on safe footin'.

964
01:05:11,516 --> 01:05:13,439
Yeah.

965
01:05:13,518 --> 01:05:16,146
You know, she don't care
nothin' about me, Zeke.

966
01:05:16,229 --> 01:05:20,655
Well, you can never tell how a
woman feels by the way she acts.

967
01:05:20,734 --> 01:05:24,705
They's all riddles, all of 'em,
and you just gotta guess 'em.

968
01:05:24,779 --> 01:05:27,658
And no matter which way
you guess, you're wrong.

969
01:05:30,243 --> 01:05:32,245
Looks like as if the way
they're puttin'

970
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:33,876
some of them outfits
over there,

971
01:05:33,955 --> 01:05:35,957
they're a-gonna lose 'em.

972
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:38,169
Hold it!

973
01:05:39,919 --> 01:05:42,547
Ha-ha! What did I tell you?

974
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:45,258
Let's get out of here afore
they get a bead on us.

975
01:05:47,844 --> 01:05:50,097
Hold it!

976
01:05:55,268 --> 01:05:57,191
Zeke, did you hear
that terrible crash?

977
01:05:57,270 --> 01:05:59,193
Hear it? I seen it.

978
01:05:59,272 --> 01:06:01,366
You did?
That was your wagon!

979
01:06:01,441 --> 01:06:03,159
Oh. Was my
mother-in-law in it?

980
01:06:03,234 --> 01:06:04,406
No, she wasn't.

981
01:06:04,486 --> 01:06:05,783
Oh, that's too bad.

982
01:06:05,862 --> 01:06:07,079
What'd you say?

983
01:06:07,155 --> 01:06:09,374
I said, "I am glad."

984
01:06:09,449 --> 01:06:11,872
Lucky for you that I wasn't,
you loafing hound.

985
01:06:11,951 --> 01:06:13,248
What you mean?

986
01:06:13,328 --> 01:06:16,377
Because I was with your wife,
Sarah, and she gave birth to twins.

987
01:06:16,456 --> 01:06:17,673
Twins? Are they both mine?

988
01:06:17,749 --> 01:06:18,716
Both.

989
01:06:18,792 --> 01:06:20,544
Oh, Mama,
are they boys or girls?

990
01:06:20,627 --> 01:06:21,674
One of each!

991
01:06:21,753 --> 01:06:24,882
Oh, Zeke, I am a papa.
 Mama, I am a papa.

992
01:06:24,964 --> 01:06:26,887
Papa, lam a mama.
Yeah.

993
01:06:26,966 --> 01:06:28,468
I got two for one.

994
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:30,349
Yeah. Let's drink
to the happy event.

995
01:06:30,428 --> 01:06:33,056
Wait a minute. There was two events.
I have two drinks.

996
01:06:33,139 --> 01:06:36,393
Here, give me that jug. I'll
take a pull at that myself.

997
01:06:45,693 --> 01:06:48,037
Three more.

998
01:06:48,113 --> 01:06:51,538
Hyah! Giddyap!

999
01:07:15,723 --> 01:07:17,851
Whoa!

1000
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:28,077
Well, who'd have guessed it?

1001
01:07:28,153 --> 01:07:29,621
If it ain't Breck Coleman.

1002
01:07:29,696 --> 01:07:30,743
Howdy, Jim.

1003
01:07:30,822 --> 01:07:32,369
Where'd you
blow in from, boy?

1004
01:07:32,449 --> 01:07:33,951
All the way from
the big river.

1005
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:37,082
Flack.

1006
01:07:37,162 --> 01:07:39,085
How long are we
gonna camp here?

1007
01:07:39,164 --> 01:07:42,964
Well, just as long as it
takes to fix up the outfit.

1008
01:07:43,042 --> 01:07:46,216
Bascom, you tell them
pilgrims of yours,

1009
01:07:46,296 --> 01:07:49,971
there's 500 miles
of desert ahead of us

1010
01:07:50,049 --> 01:07:52,643
and them that don't like
what's comin' to them,

1011
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:56,189
now's the time for
'em to turn back.

1012
01:08:18,786 --> 01:08:22,131
Yes, sir, that pork
is nearly done right now.

1013
01:08:40,099 --> 01:08:42,898
Shank me off a snack!

1014
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:46,023
Get out of there.

1015
01:08:46,105 --> 01:08:47,823
Fine piece of beef.

1016
01:08:47,899 --> 01:08:50,823
Ah!

1017
01:08:53,154 --> 01:08:55,327
Fetch it on over here.

1018
01:08:58,535 --> 01:09:02,290
I hate to see you
at menial tasks.

1019
01:09:02,372 --> 01:09:06,878
If we were only back at my
old plantation in Louisiana,

1020
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,759
you'd have a dozen servants
to wait on you.

1021
01:09:12,966 --> 01:09:15,060
Let's turn back.

1022
01:09:15,134 --> 01:09:19,139
Turn back, Mr. Thorpe?
Why... Oh. Why, I...

1023
01:09:19,639 --> 01:09:21,812
Oh, Honey Girl, didn't I tell
you to stay away from the fire?

1024
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:24,064
Yes. And you told me not to
be sitting in a rocking chair

1025
01:09:24,143 --> 01:09:26,316
when Breck Coleman
was around.

1026
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:27,526
Hello, Coleman.

1027
01:09:27,605 --> 01:09:28,982
Howdy, Dave.

1028
01:09:31,609 --> 01:09:34,658
You shot these turkeys. Won't
you stay and help us eat them?

1029
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:38,742
No. Uh, I just had supper
with the Bascoms.

1030
01:09:38,825 --> 01:09:40,748
Sorry, Breck.

1031
01:09:40,827 --> 01:09:43,330
Think I'll go
hunt up old Zeke.

1032
01:09:47,584 --> 01:09:50,303
How many's that
for you, Windy?

1033
01:09:50,378 --> 01:09:52,722
Number 84.

1034
01:09:52,797 --> 01:09:54,720
Well, here comes 85.

1035
01:09:54,799 --> 01:09:56,426
Hello, Zeke. Windy.

1036
01:09:56,509 --> 01:09:58,056
Hello, boy.

1037
01:09:58,136 --> 01:10:00,389
I smell turkey a-cookin'.

1038
01:10:00,471 --> 01:10:03,771
That's all I got was a smell.

1039
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:06,603
Deal me a hand
of them flapjacks.

1040
01:10:06,686 --> 01:10:08,688
That's the way
it's done, Gussie.

1041
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:11,991
My old arm's giving out. Now you try it.
I'll get a pail of water.

1042
01:10:12,066 --> 01:10:14,034
That's easy.
I can do that.

1043
01:10:15,528 --> 01:10:18,532
See, I've saw Zeke do that
till he broke his arm.

1044
01:10:18,615 --> 01:10:22,165
Yes. And you know, someday my
mother-in-law's gonna talk so much,

1045
01:10:22,243 --> 01:10:23,916
she's going to break
her "yaw."

1046
01:10:25,455 --> 01:10:29,551
Say, boy, I wouldn't let my
mother-in-law boss me around like that.

1047
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:32,880
Stand up to her like a man.
Face her down, boy.

1048
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:36,808
Huh. If it was me, I'd tell
her what was on my chest.

1049
01:10:36,883 --> 01:10:39,477
You got nothing
on your chest but wind!

1050
01:10:41,721 --> 01:10:43,644
You old polecat.

1051
01:10:46,017 --> 01:10:48,065
I've just been
talking with some trappers

1052
01:10:48,144 --> 01:10:50,146
who've come out
of the Southwest.

1053
01:10:50,229 --> 01:10:54,575
They say the country they
call California is wonderful.

1054
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:56,653
Yes, so I've heard.

1055
01:10:58,154 --> 01:11:00,623
Why won't you come with me
to a land like that?

1056
01:11:00,698 --> 01:11:02,621
Are you going there?

1057
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,577
If you'll come with me.

1058
01:11:04,661 --> 01:11:07,084
Well, what about
your plantation in Louisiana?

1059
01:11:08,665 --> 01:11:11,589
Oh. Well...

1060
01:11:11,668 --> 01:11:14,137
If we like
California better,

1061
01:11:14,212 --> 01:11:17,842
we could sell my holdings and
buy vast lands out there.

1062
01:11:20,885 --> 01:11:23,308
Well, it's...
It's a compliment

1063
01:11:23,388 --> 01:11:26,392
to offer me all that,
but it can't be.

1064
01:11:26,474 --> 01:11:28,727
I must join Davey.

1065
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:34,490
Oh, Dave.
Dave, come over here.

1066
01:11:34,565 --> 01:11:38,695
Black Elk here says that you and
your sister were so good to him,

1067
01:11:38,778 --> 01:11:42,453
when he come in to visit that he
wants to give you all them ponies.

1068
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:44,708
Well, that's kind
of him, Zeke,

1069
01:11:44,784 --> 01:11:46,536
but we couldn't
take their horses.

1070
01:11:46,619 --> 01:11:49,748
Oh, of course you could.
They got hundreds of ponies.

1071
01:11:55,461 --> 01:11:57,884
He wants you to show him
where to put 'em.

1072
01:11:57,964 --> 01:12:01,138
You go and throw them ponies
in with your herd.

1073
01:12:03,344 --> 01:12:05,517
Why, Zeke, you lyin' old coot.

1074
01:12:05,596 --> 01:12:09,692
That Injun's buying Cameron's
sister for Coleman's squaw.

1075
01:12:12,478 --> 01:12:16,073
Well... Well...
Well, why not?

1076
01:12:16,149 --> 01:12:19,278
So Coleman's
buying himself a squaw, eh?

1077
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,113
Zeke, you old
whiskered Cupid, you!

1078
01:12:28,119 --> 01:12:30,747
I loathe
the very sight of you!

1079
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:32,047
What have I done now?

1080
01:12:32,123 --> 01:12:33,921
You've made me
the joke of the plains.

1081
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,047
Me?

1082
01:12:35,126 --> 01:12:38,676
Who else tried to buy me
like an Indian squaw?

1083
01:12:38,755 --> 01:12:40,883
You put me to shame
before them all.

1084
01:12:40,965 --> 01:12:43,093
Why, girl,
you're imagining things.

1085
01:12:43,176 --> 01:12:45,349
Oh... Ohh! Ohh!

1086
01:12:49,849 --> 01:12:53,444
Zeke always told me
women were damned funny.

1087
01:12:53,519 --> 01:12:56,272
Mr. Thorpe,
I've changed my mind.

1088
01:12:56,355 --> 01:12:59,199
I'll go with you to California
if you'll go at once.

1089
01:12:59,275 --> 01:13:03,075
At once?
Why, yes, yes.

1090
01:13:03,154 --> 01:13:06,704
Uh, I'll make
preparations immediately.

1091
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:10,328
This is a fine
state of affairs.

1092
01:13:10,411 --> 01:13:13,085
This man Thorpe isn't
all he claims to be.

1093
01:13:13,164 --> 01:13:16,668
My mind is made up, Davey, and
we're going to California.

1094
01:13:18,211 --> 01:13:20,430
Where's Flack?

1095
01:13:28,346 --> 01:13:29,689
Hey!

1096
01:13:34,602 --> 01:13:36,525
I just came in to
tell you good-bye.

1097
01:13:36,604 --> 01:13:40,404
Uh, good-bye?
Where are you going?

1098
01:13:40,483 --> 01:13:43,077
I'm going to take my outfit
and leave you here.

1099
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:48,283
Uh, your outfit? All you got
is one horse and two guns.

1100
01:13:48,366 --> 01:13:51,370
No, the Cameron
outfit's mine now.

1101
01:13:51,452 --> 01:13:53,204
Oh, it is, eh?

1102
01:13:53,871 --> 01:13:56,124
Yes, we're going
to California,

1103
01:13:56,207 --> 01:13:58,676
so I'll bid you
a fond farewell.

1104
01:13:58,751 --> 01:13:59,798
No, you ain't!

1105
01:14:00,336 --> 01:14:02,054
No?
Nah!

1106
01:14:02,129 --> 01:14:06,430
Why do you suppose
I grubstaked you for, eh?

1107
01:14:06,509 --> 01:14:09,388
So far, you've
been a fizzle.

1108
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:11,973
One try, one miss.

1109
01:14:12,056 --> 01:14:13,524
Oh, he's no longer
in my way.

1110
01:14:13,599 --> 01:14:15,021
Well, he's in mine.

1111
01:14:15,101 --> 01:14:16,853
Well, tear him
down yourself.

1112
01:14:16,936 --> 01:14:20,440
Oh, I'd like to
kick him into pulp.

1113
01:14:20,523 --> 01:14:23,367
Oh, I'd like to
break him in two like a...

1114
01:14:23,442 --> 01:14:24,864
Well, why not?

1115
01:14:26,362 --> 01:14:32,085
I don't mind fists or feet,
or even a gun.

1116
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:35,914
It's the way
he throws that knife.

1117
01:14:35,997 --> 01:14:37,374
But why should I risk it?

1118
01:14:37,456 --> 01:14:41,302
Because you're a dead shot.

1119
01:14:41,794 --> 01:14:45,014
You're a-going to stick.

1120
01:14:45,089 --> 01:14:49,435
You're a-going to prove
how good you are,

1121
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:50,727
before you leave the fort.

1122
01:14:50,803 --> 01:14:52,020
And if I don't?

1123
01:14:52,096 --> 01:14:54,098
Well, if you don't...

1124
01:14:54,557 --> 01:14:56,901
I'll tell that little filly

1125
01:14:56,976 --> 01:15:01,573
there's a wide-open noose
waitin' for you

1126
01:15:01,647 --> 01:15:04,196
in every river town.

1127
01:15:04,275 --> 01:15:10,248
Thorpe, you do your
job before you leave the fort.

1128
01:15:30,009 --> 01:15:32,137
Howdy, Henry.

1129
01:15:32,219 --> 01:15:33,937
How's things, Coleman?
Just fine.

1130
01:15:34,013 --> 01:15:36,766
Say,
Black Elk was telling me

1131
01:15:36,849 --> 01:15:37,975
that all the Injuns
in the West

1132
01:15:38,059 --> 01:15:40,983
was gathering to keep you
all from passin' through.

1133
01:15:41,062 --> 01:15:43,531
So they tell me.

1134
01:15:43,606 --> 01:15:45,984
Black Elk and the Cheyennes
are going west

1135
01:15:46,067 --> 01:15:48,695
to hold a powwow
with the Shoshones.

1136
01:15:48,778 --> 01:15:50,951
Yeah, Black Elk tells me
that it's almost certain

1137
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:53,533
that the Cheyennes
will declare war later.

1138
01:15:53,616 --> 01:15:54,663
Likely.

1139
01:15:54,742 --> 01:15:57,291
Old Pete Rubideaux was asking
about you a while ago.

1140
01:15:57,370 --> 01:15:58,792
Pete? Where is he?

1141
01:15:58,871 --> 01:16:01,624
Camped at the spring yonder
with his new squaw.

1142
01:16:01,707 --> 01:16:03,300
I think I'll ramble
down and see him.

1143
01:16:03,376 --> 01:16:04,548
Sure.

1144
01:16:04,627 --> 01:16:07,176
Say, Henry, will you put a
new cap nipple on this gun?

1145
01:16:07,254 --> 01:16:09,222
Sure will, boy.

1146
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:11,847
And a new trigger
spring in the pistol.

1147
01:16:11,926 --> 01:16:12,973
All right.

1148
01:16:13,052 --> 01:16:14,804
I'll leave 'em with you
while I go see Pete.

1149
01:16:14,887 --> 01:16:17,106
Be ready
when you come back.

1150
01:16:45,584 --> 01:16:48,588
We are about to unite
this loving and devoted couple

1151
01:16:48,671 --> 01:16:51,550
in the holy bonds
of wedlock.

1152
01:16:52,091 --> 01:16:54,560
Hank Ginnis, do you
take this woman

1153
01:16:54,635 --> 01:16:56,308
to be your
lawful wedded wife?

1154
01:16:56,387 --> 01:16:57,764
I do.

1155
01:16:57,847 --> 01:17:01,021
Abigail Vance,
do you take this man

1156
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:03,603
to be your
lawful wedded husband?

1157
01:17:06,689 --> 01:17:08,942
She does!

1158
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:19,352
Hey, Flack.

1159
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:20,429
Yeah?

1160
01:18:20,513 --> 01:18:24,563
You recollect how Coleman done
told you that if Lopez here,

1161
01:18:24,642 --> 01:18:27,771
or Thorpe done strayed off
into the brush,

1162
01:18:27,853 --> 01:18:29,446
they weren't likely as how
never come back?

1163
01:18:29,522 --> 01:18:30,569
Sure!

1164
01:18:30,648 --> 01:18:33,697
He made some kind of a bluff.
What of it?

1165
01:18:33,776 --> 01:18:35,778
Well, uh,
Thorpe strayed out

1166
01:18:35,861 --> 01:18:38,364
and he ain't
a-never comin' back.

1167
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:39,448
Hey?

1168
01:18:39,532 --> 01:18:40,875
No.

1169
01:18:42,118 --> 01:18:45,463
He's done gone back
to his old plantation.

1170
01:18:45,538 --> 01:18:47,461
Yeah.

1171
01:18:51,377 --> 01:18:54,472
Well, you won't go to
California with Thorpe now.

1172
01:18:54,547 --> 01:18:55,719
Why not?

1173
01:18:55,798 --> 01:18:57,800
He and Coleman
just met in the brush,

1174
01:18:57,883 --> 01:19:00,477
and Coleman shot him.

1175
01:19:00,553 --> 01:19:01,725
Are you sure?

1176
01:19:01,804 --> 01:19:03,522
I heard the shot.

1177
01:19:03,597 --> 01:19:05,770
And I saw Coleman
standing there over him.

1178
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:07,852
It suits me too.

1179
01:19:09,436 --> 01:19:11,689
So he'll even do murder.

1180
01:19:11,772 --> 01:19:15,322
And so I pronounce you
man and wife.

1181
01:19:15,401 --> 01:19:17,995
And may peace
and happiness be yours.

1182
01:19:23,242 --> 01:19:25,836
There's been a murder!
There's been a murder!

1183
01:19:25,911 --> 01:19:29,461
A murder? Where?
Where, girl? Who?

1184
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:32,259
Coleman met Mr. Thorpe
in the brush and shot him!

1185
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:35,508
That's a serious accusation, my girl.
Are you sure?

1186
01:19:35,588 --> 01:19:36,680
My brother saw it.

1187
01:19:36,755 --> 01:19:40,350
Men, we can't have cold-blooded
murderers among us.

1188
01:19:40,426 --> 01:19:42,679
There's the man
that shot Bill Thorpe

1189
01:19:42,761 --> 01:19:44,934
down like a dog.
Lopez, go and get a rope.

1190
01:19:45,014 --> 01:19:46,015
Get a rope.

1191
01:19:46,098 --> 01:19:47,099
Yeah, get the rope!

1192
01:19:47,183 --> 01:19:50,312
And just who accuses me
of killing Thorpe?

1193
01:19:50,769 --> 01:19:54,069
It, uh...
It was Miss Cameron.

1194
01:19:55,608 --> 01:19:57,656
Huh.

1195
01:19:57,735 --> 01:20:00,454
You, eh?

1196
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:03,078
So you'd like
to see me hang.

1197
01:20:08,204 --> 01:20:10,753
Listen to me, you.

1198
01:20:10,831 --> 01:20:13,209
This boy, Coleman, here just
couldn't have killed Thorpe.

1199
01:20:13,292 --> 01:20:14,384
Why not?

1200
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:16,212
'Cause he didn't
have no guns on him.

1201
01:20:16,295 --> 01:20:18,047
He left his'n with
Dutch Henry to be fixed.

1202
01:20:18,130 --> 01:20:20,428
Coleman and Thorpe were at
odds with the Cameron girl.

1203
01:20:20,507 --> 01:20:22,851
If it wasn't Coleman,
who was it who shot Thorpe?

1204
01:20:22,927 --> 01:20:26,022
Since you're aimin' to know,
I'll tell you who done it.

1205
01:20:26,096 --> 01:20:28,849
Who?
I shot that skunk myself!

1206
01:20:28,933 --> 01:20:30,901
Coleman's a friend
of his, men.

1207
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:32,978
He's lying to save his neck.

1208
01:20:33,062 --> 01:20:35,360
What could Zeke have
against a man like Thorpe?

1209
01:20:35,439 --> 01:20:36,440
You want to know that too?

1210
01:20:36,523 --> 01:20:37,695
Yes, I want
to know that too!

1211
01:20:37,775 --> 01:20:38,901
Well, I'm a-tellin' ya.

1212
01:20:39,526 --> 01:20:41,699
I was camped out
pretty close to you,

1213
01:20:41,779 --> 01:20:45,249
and I heared that powwow
you had with Thorpe.

1214
01:20:45,324 --> 01:20:46,576
Yeah? What are
you driving at?

1215
01:20:46,659 --> 01:20:47,911
Just this.

1216
01:20:47,993 --> 01:20:50,587
When a man begins to do a lot
of talkin' about hangin',

1217
01:20:50,663 --> 01:20:52,711
he'd better make
pretty sure as to who's

1218
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:54,792
gonna decorate
the end of the rope.

1219
01:20:54,875 --> 01:20:55,876
Get my meaning?

1220
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:58,804
Well, Thorpe ain't nothin' to me.
It's no affair of mine.

1221
01:20:58,879 --> 01:21:00,506
That's just what
I was a-thinkin'.

1222
01:21:00,589 --> 01:21:01,681
Huh.

1223
01:21:01,757 --> 01:21:03,885
And Coleman ain't gonna
do no scouting,

1224
01:21:03,968 --> 01:21:06,596
while I'm boss of this train.

1225
01:21:06,679 --> 01:21:09,899
I'm leaving him behind.

1226
01:21:14,019 --> 01:21:15,362
Coleman would never...

1227
01:21:15,896 --> 01:21:20,242
Ah, now, we're taking on
a new scout.

1228
01:21:20,317 --> 01:21:22,615
Guess again, Flack.

1229
01:21:22,695 --> 01:21:25,244
I started with this outfit, and
I'll be with it at the finish.

1230
01:21:25,322 --> 01:21:26,289
Who says so?

1231
01:21:26,365 --> 01:21:27,617
I'm just telling ya.

1232
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:29,668
I got two reasons.

1233
01:21:29,743 --> 01:21:33,919
One is I told Wellmore
I'd scout the train through.

1234
01:21:33,998 --> 01:21:36,797
The other is a little personal
business I aim to transact

1235
01:21:36,875 --> 01:21:38,843
at the end of the trail.

1236
01:21:38,919 --> 01:21:41,923
See if you can figure out
what that is, Flack.

1237
01:21:45,926 --> 01:21:49,467
Coleman, the settlers
are willing to push on.

1238
01:21:49,493 --> 01:21:52,933
We'll follow you.
What's this talk about Injuns?

1239
01:21:53,017 --> 01:21:54,985
It's true.
The Injuns are gathering

1240
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:56,937
to the westward to stop us
from going through.

1241
01:21:57,021 --> 01:21:59,490
Injuns have never yet
prevented our breed of men

1242
01:21:59,565 --> 01:22:01,533
from travelin'
into the settin' sun.

1243
01:22:01,608 --> 01:22:03,360
Go on. Lead the way.

1244
01:22:03,444 --> 01:22:06,869
Well, get your outfits together.
We're going.

1245
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:11,369
Never mind what you see
or what you hear.

1246
01:22:11,452 --> 01:22:15,332
Red Flack is still
boss of the train.

1247
01:22:15,414 --> 01:22:16,666
Get her going!

1248
01:22:16,749 --> 01:22:19,423
Go on.
Let's pull out and follow!

1249
01:22:28,844 --> 01:22:30,846
Giddyap!

1250
01:23:02,503 --> 01:23:04,505
Hup!

1251
01:23:05,631 --> 01:23:07,554
Ho!

1252
01:23:18,602 --> 01:23:20,900
Fall in!

1253
01:23:20,979 --> 01:23:22,071
Nag, giddyap!

1254
01:23:22,147 --> 01:23:23,273
Get in!

1255
01:23:53,846 --> 01:23:56,224
It's no use, men.

1256
01:23:56,306 --> 01:23:58,058
She's all dried up.

1257
01:23:58,142 --> 01:24:02,443
Hey, them settlers
is dyin' off like rats.

1258
01:24:02,521 --> 01:24:06,276
We're for moving on.
Come on, Lopez.

1259
01:24:06,358 --> 01:24:10,704
Boy, they're scattered
back all across the desert.

1260
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:14,204
We gotta gather 'em up
and shove 'em along.

1261
01:24:45,898 --> 01:24:48,651
Old Charlie died, Coleman.

1262
01:24:48,734 --> 01:24:51,453
We raised him from a colt.

1263
01:24:51,528 --> 01:24:53,701
Tough, boy.

1264
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:56,124
But we gotta
battle it through.

1265
01:24:59,953 --> 01:25:02,547
Hyah!

1266
01:25:04,041 --> 01:25:06,169
Giddyap!

1267
01:25:06,251 --> 01:25:09,972
Giddyap, Toby!
Giddyap, Toby! Giddyap!

1268
01:25:10,047 --> 01:25:11,173
Giddyap there!
Giddyap, Toby!

1269
01:25:11,256 --> 01:25:12,883
Come on!

1270
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:15,844
Come on!

1271
01:25:18,096 --> 01:25:20,098
Work 'em on through!

1272
01:27:50,165 --> 01:27:52,042
Whoa!

1273
01:27:53,168 --> 01:27:55,170
What's all this?

1274
01:27:56,171 --> 01:27:58,014
Injun signs!

1275
01:27:58,090 --> 01:28:00,343
Pull up! Pull up!

1276
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:04,262
Pull up!

1277
01:28:35,127 --> 01:28:37,129
Pull up there!

1278
01:28:53,562 --> 01:28:56,156
Pull over!

1279
01:29:02,904 --> 01:29:04,906
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

1280
01:29:27,929 --> 01:29:29,055
Here's your gun, boy!

1281
01:29:29,139 --> 01:29:30,732
All right.

1282
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:36,529
Get up there.

1283
01:29:41,067 --> 01:29:44,321
Come on! Come on!
Get in here! Hurry up!

1284
01:29:44,404 --> 01:29:46,702
Don't panic!

1285
01:30:00,504 --> 01:30:01,972
Looks like
Crows and Cheyennes, Zeke.

1286
01:30:02,047 --> 01:30:03,219
Yeah.

1287
01:30:10,514 --> 01:30:13,438
Now let's throw it into 'em!

1288
01:31:03,692 --> 01:31:06,036
Stop shootin', everybody!

1289
01:31:06,111 --> 01:31:09,081
Stop shootin'!
They're ridin' off.

1290
01:31:09,281 --> 01:31:13,127
When they wheel back on us,
reload it up and give it to 'em!

1291
01:32:33,865 --> 01:32:35,867
Yes, sir!

1292
01:32:35,951 --> 01:32:38,921
There they go, boy.
There they go.

1293
01:32:38,995 --> 01:32:43,125
Ha! I guess we was just
a little too much for 'em.

1294
01:33:12,946 --> 01:33:16,325
Father, our good
friends have perished here

1295
01:33:16,408 --> 01:33:18,786
at the hands of the savages.

1296
01:33:18,868 --> 01:33:23,044
Open your arms to them
and care for our loved ones

1297
01:33:23,123 --> 01:33:25,592
until we meet again
on the other shore.

1298
01:33:25,667 --> 01:33:27,590
Amen.

1299
01:33:31,798 --> 01:33:34,802
Well, Zeke...

1300
01:33:34,884 --> 01:33:37,683
Ol' Windy's gone
on another trail.

1301
01:33:40,890 --> 01:33:44,440
Windy, you and me was...

1302
01:33:45,895 --> 01:33:49,616
Well, you and me was, uh...

1303
01:33:53,403 --> 01:33:55,531
Oh, my baby!

1304
01:33:55,613 --> 01:33:58,867
My baby! Oh, no!

1305
01:33:58,950 --> 01:34:00,952
My baby!

1306
01:34:04,497 --> 01:34:07,546
Well, Zeke, I'm gonna
trail the Injuns

1307
01:34:07,625 --> 01:34:10,048
and make sure they go
back to their villages.

1308
01:34:10,128 --> 01:34:11,254
So you scout
the train ahead,

1309
01:34:11,337 --> 01:34:13,214
and I'll pick it up
in a week or so.

1310
01:34:13,298 --> 01:34:15,300
Bye, Zeke.

1311
01:34:16,426 --> 01:34:18,428
Bye, boy.

1312
01:35:03,598 --> 01:35:04,770
Giddyap, there!

1313
01:35:04,849 --> 01:35:07,147
Giddyap, there!
Giddyap!

1314
01:35:07,227 --> 01:35:09,525
Get over there!
Giddyap, there!

1315
01:35:09,604 --> 01:35:11,606
Come on, boys.

1316
01:35:17,904 --> 01:35:20,373
Get a hold of that wheel!

1317
01:35:21,491 --> 01:35:22,788
Tough time!

1318
01:35:22,867 --> 01:35:24,119
Lopez! Lopez,
get 'em in line!

1319
01:35:24,202 --> 01:35:25,294
<i>Hey, sí!</i>

1320
01:35:25,370 --> 01:35:26,622
Put the whip to them!

1321
01:35:32,961 --> 01:35:34,884
Hey!

1322
01:35:34,963 --> 01:35:36,135
Pull the trailers!

1323
01:35:36,214 --> 01:35:37,466
Giddyap there!

1324
01:35:37,549 --> 01:35:38,926
Get on Up!

1325
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,225
Work 'em over!

1326
01:35:41,886 --> 01:35:43,888
Go on!

1327
01:35:47,392 --> 01:35:49,394
Get outta there!

1328
01:35:49,477 --> 01:35:51,650
Come on, Bob!

1329
01:35:51,729 --> 01:35:53,322
Get 'em movin' to the right!

1330
01:35:53,398 --> 01:35:55,366
Get over there!

1331
01:35:55,441 --> 01:35:59,036
Hey! Get over there!
Giddyap, boy!

1332
01:35:59,571 --> 01:36:03,166
Come on. Come on.
Giddyap. Giddyap.

1333
01:36:04,075 --> 01:36:06,077
There we go!

1334
01:36:06,327 --> 01:36:09,547
I wonder how long
we'll be bogged down here.

1335
01:36:09,622 --> 01:36:12,501
I don't know. I heard there
was three wagons already turned back.

1336
01:36:12,584 --> 01:36:15,178
Ma, let's turn back
to Missouri!

1337
01:36:15,253 --> 01:36:18,928
Me? Turn back because
of a little mud?

1338
01:36:19,007 --> 01:36:22,511
Say, Uncle, when did
Bascom women ever turn back?

1339
01:36:22,594 --> 01:36:26,315
Grandma, don't you and Ma
know that Pa is only jokin'?

1340
01:36:26,389 --> 01:36:29,814
Ha! All right now.
Be powerful on it now.

1341
01:36:29,893 --> 01:36:32,692
Hyah! Hyah!

1342
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:38,364
Go on there, Fanny!
Go on, Meg!

1343
01:36:38,443 --> 01:36:41,697
Go on there, Jennie!
Jennie, go on! Go on, go on!

1344
01:36:41,779 --> 01:36:43,781
Oh, we're stuck.

1345
01:36:43,865 --> 01:36:46,869
Gus, you idiot!
You see what you've done?

1346
01:36:46,951 --> 01:36:49,579
You've got my wagon
up to the hub in mud!

1347
01:36:49,662 --> 01:36:53,212
What are you kickin' about?
I am sitting on my mule.

1348
01:36:53,291 --> 01:36:54,383
Oh!

1349
01:36:54,459 --> 01:36:55,426
But don't worry, Mama.

1350
01:36:55,501 --> 01:36:58,880
I think it's gonna clear up.
There will be no more rain.

1351
01:36:58,963 --> 01:37:01,216
Get up! Get up!
Throw that idiot...

1352
01:37:01,299 --> 01:37:03,222
Throw that idiot a rope
and help him out of there.

1353
01:37:11,935 --> 01:37:13,937
Keep in line!

1354
01:37:18,316 --> 01:37:20,910
Get up here!

1355
01:37:20,985 --> 01:37:23,488
Take the settlers
to the right!

1356
01:37:24,781 --> 01:37:26,783
Get over here!

1357
01:37:31,496 --> 01:37:32,622
Get up in there!

1358
01:37:35,667 --> 01:37:38,216
Come over here and hold on.

1359
01:37:38,294 --> 01:37:43,551
Giddyap there!

1360
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:05,822
Keep it in line!

1361
01:38:16,374 --> 01:38:18,126
Get over there!
Get over there!

1362
01:38:21,212 --> 01:38:23,214
Come on, boy!

1363
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:34,609
Giddyap there!

1364
01:38:40,523 --> 01:38:42,525
Keep it going!

1365
01:39:08,926 --> 01:39:11,725
Come on there!

1366
01:39:17,185 --> 01:39:19,187
Keep it going!

1367
01:39:50,009 --> 01:39:52,888
Here, Abbie.
Here's the water.

1368
01:39:52,970 --> 01:39:54,563
Mama,
I got good news for you.

1369
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:56,516
Ah, you're always
bad news to me.

1370
01:39:56,599 --> 01:39:58,067
Get on your long
underwear quick.

1371
01:39:58,893 --> 01:39:59,894
Why?

1372
01:39:59,977 --> 01:40:04,528
Well, you're going in the snow
up to your... Up to your... Your...

1373
01:40:04,607 --> 01:40:08,328
Way up, Mama. And hand
me out my bear overcoat.

1374
01:40:09,654 --> 01:40:10,871
Well, Useless...

1375
01:40:10,947 --> 01:40:14,668
You're going someplace
you won't want to sit down.

1376
01:40:14,992 --> 01:40:17,836
It's so cold,
it'll freeze your hooves off.

1377
01:40:17,912 --> 01:40:19,505
You wait and see.

1378
01:40:19,831 --> 01:40:22,380
Think I'll go say howdy
to the Camerons.

1379
01:40:27,505 --> 01:40:28,722
This is my best overcoat.

1380
01:40:28,798 --> 01:40:31,051
Well, I'd hate to
see your worst one.

1381
01:40:31,467 --> 01:40:32,468
Hello, Gus.

1382
01:40:32,552 --> 01:40:33,599
Oh, hello there, Breck.

1383
01:40:33,678 --> 01:40:35,601
I'm certainly glad
to see you back again.

1384
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:37,682
What are you wearing
the heavy overcoat for?

1385
01:40:37,765 --> 01:40:39,392
I'm getting all
ready for that snow.

1386
01:40:39,517 --> 01:40:41,190
No, we won't be
there for days.

1387
01:40:41,269 --> 01:40:44,148
Well, anyway, I'm going
to keep warm by the camp.

1388
01:40:44,230 --> 01:40:46,073
Where's the Cameron outfit?

1389
01:40:46,149 --> 01:40:47,901
Oh, we left them
four or five days back.

1390
01:40:47,984 --> 01:40:49,782
Left 'em?

1391
01:40:49,861 --> 01:40:51,613
Yes. All their horses give
out. They couldn't go on.

1392
01:40:51,696 --> 01:40:54,950
Fifteen, 20 wagons. They
all went back to the fort.

1393
01:40:55,032 --> 01:40:56,955
I hated to tell ya, son.

1394
01:40:57,034 --> 01:40:58,957
Zeke, why did you
let the Camerons go?

1395
01:40:59,078 --> 01:41:01,001
Ah, not my doin', son.

1396
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:03,503
Flack knows
I savvy Injun sign,

1397
01:41:03,583 --> 01:41:05,176
so he sends me
on ahead to scout.

1398
01:41:05,251 --> 01:41:07,595
And when I come back,
they'd all dropped out.

1399
01:41:07,670 --> 01:41:10,344
If Injuns chance on those wagons,
they'll kill the lot of 'em.

1400
01:41:10,423 --> 01:41:12,642
I'm afeard so, Breck boy.

1401
01:41:12,717 --> 01:41:14,435
The Way's clear ahead, Zeke.
You scout 'em.

1402
01:41:14,510 --> 01:41:15,602
Yeah.

1403
01:41:15,678 --> 01:41:16,804
I'm going back
for the Camerons.

1404
01:41:16,888 --> 01:41:17,935
Good luck, son!

1405
01:41:18,014 --> 01:41:19,061
Giddyap, Jennie!

1406
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:20,141
Well, Useless...

1407
01:41:20,224 --> 01:41:21,567
Giddyap, Jennie!

1408
01:41:21,642 --> 01:41:22,939
I don't know who smells
the worse, you or me.

1409
01:41:23,019 --> 01:41:23,986
Go ahead there!

1410
01:41:24,061 --> 01:41:25,187
Come on. Here we go again.

1411
01:41:25,271 --> 01:41:27,273
Pull, Fanny!

1412
01:41:57,094 --> 01:41:59,142
Hello! Hello!

1413
01:41:59,222 --> 01:42:01,224
Huh!

1414
01:42:05,937 --> 01:42:08,611
I felt someway
that you'd come.

1415
01:42:09,398 --> 01:42:11,947
I'd have been here
a heap sooner if I could've.

1416
01:42:12,777 --> 01:42:14,700
Say, Dave, you'd
better out off that trailer

1417
01:42:14,779 --> 01:42:16,031
and throw everything
into one wagon.

1418
01:42:16,113 --> 01:42:17,114
All right.

1419
01:42:17,281 --> 01:42:18,533
I'll hitch up Ol' Rhody

1420
01:42:18,616 --> 01:42:21,119
and we'll see if we can
get out of here.

1421
01:42:22,620 --> 01:42:24,372
After you left,

1422
01:42:24,455 --> 01:42:27,208
old Zeke told me the truth
about some matters.

1423
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:29,301
Thorpe and Flack and all.

1424
01:42:30,044 --> 01:42:31,637
He did, eh?

1425
01:42:31,712 --> 01:42:33,806
Sorry I was so stupid.

1426
01:42:34,382 --> 01:42:38,387
Oh, don't worry, Miss Ruth.
Things did look sort of queer.

1427
01:42:38,469 --> 01:42:40,597
I should have known better.

1428
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:44,480
Well, we all get off on the
wrong trail once in a while.

1429
01:42:46,936 --> 01:42:49,359
We'll make it
through all right.

1430
01:42:49,438 --> 01:42:52,066
Well, that's fixed.
Can I do something, Breck?

1431
01:42:52,149 --> 01:42:54,402
No, I guess not.

1432
01:42:54,485 --> 01:42:57,785
We oughta overtake those
settlers in a week or so.

1433
01:42:57,905 --> 01:43:00,624
Here you are, Ruthie.
Take it.

1434
01:43:10,334 --> 01:43:11,756
We're goin' again, Davey.

1435
01:43:11,836 --> 01:43:13,133
Heave-ho.

1436
01:43:16,799 --> 01:43:20,303
Pull 'er there. Come on.
Come on there, Shortie.

1437
01:43:44,785 --> 01:43:47,755
What did I tell you, huh?
You wouldn't listen to me.

1438
01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:50,800
You wouldn't listen to me!
We're lost!

1439
01:43:50,875 --> 01:43:54,596
There ain't a man here that
knows the pass over them hills!

1440
01:43:54,670 --> 01:43:56,047
We're for turning back!

1441
01:43:57,590 --> 01:43:59,592
Wait! Wait!

1442
01:43:59,675 --> 01:44:03,305
Follow me and I'll lead you to that
valley that Coleman told us about.

1443
01:44:03,387 --> 01:44:08,143
Coleman, huh? He's the
only one that knows the way out,

1444
01:44:08,225 --> 01:44:10,694
and he's deserted us!

1445
01:44:10,770 --> 01:44:11,817
Sure, he quit!

1446
01:44:11,896 --> 01:44:15,241
If he was here, I'd shoot
him down in his tracks.

1447
01:44:16,233 --> 01:44:19,237
Well, Flack, just when
you gonna start this shootin'?

1448
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:23,075
You're just in time, Coleman.
Did you find the Camerons?

1449
01:44:23,157 --> 01:44:25,205
They're over yonder.
What's the trouble here?

1450
01:44:25,284 --> 01:44:28,083
They're all against me.
They're turning back.

1451
01:44:28,162 --> 01:44:30,415
No, you're not!

1452
01:44:30,498 --> 01:44:32,717
We can't turn back.

1453
01:44:32,792 --> 01:44:35,386
We're blazing a trail
that started in England.

1454
01:44:35,461 --> 01:44:36,963
Not even storms
of the sea could

1455
01:44:37,046 --> 01:44:39,174
turn back those
first settlers.

1456
01:44:39,256 --> 01:44:41,429
And they carried
it on further.

1457
01:44:41,509 --> 01:44:44,353
They blazed it on through
the wilderness of Kentucky.

1458
01:44:44,428 --> 01:44:48,399
Famine, hunger, not even
massacres could stop them.

1459
01:44:48,474 --> 01:44:50,727
And now we've picked up
the trail again,

1460
01:44:50,810 --> 01:44:53,438
and nothing can stop us!

1461
01:44:53,521 --> 01:44:57,196
Not even the snows of winter nor the
peaks of the highest mountains.

1462
01:44:57,274 --> 01:45:00,949
We're building a nation!
So we've got to suffer.

1463
01:45:01,737 --> 01:45:05,537
No great trail was ever
blazed without hardship.

1464
01:45:05,616 --> 01:45:08,870
And you've gotta fight!
That's life.

1465
01:45:08,953 --> 01:45:11,706
And when you stop fightin',
that's death.

1466
01:45:11,789 --> 01:45:13,883
What are you gonna do,
lie down and die?

1467
01:45:14,208 --> 01:45:15,300
No!

1468
01:45:15,418 --> 01:45:16,510
No!

1469
01:45:16,585 --> 01:45:19,179
Not in a thousand years.
You're going on with me!

1470
01:45:19,255 --> 01:45:22,225
The word is said,
and we'll follow you.

1471
01:45:22,299 --> 01:45:23,551
Be ready to start at sunup!

1472
01:45:32,476 --> 01:45:35,400
Well... Well,
he's turned up again.

1473
01:45:38,149 --> 01:45:40,493
Yeah, well, he'll down
the both of us.

1474
01:45:40,568 --> 01:45:42,946
You've got to
get him tonight.

1475
01:45:43,028 --> 01:45:44,996
But they can hear
a shot at night.

1476
01:45:45,072 --> 01:45:46,745
Well, they can't
hear a knife.

1477
01:45:46,824 --> 01:45:48,201
They all know
this knife of mine.

1478
01:45:49,452 --> 01:45:54,128
Well, here's a knife
they don't know.

1479
01:45:54,206 --> 01:45:55,753
No, no, no, no.
I afraid of that knife.

1480
01:45:57,501 --> 01:45:58,502
I know where you got it.

1481
01:45:58,586 --> 01:46:00,179
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

1482
01:46:00,796 --> 01:46:02,844
It will get us
in trouble sure.

1483
01:46:03,007 --> 01:46:05,055
How?

1484
01:46:05,134 --> 01:46:06,932
Because a dead man's
knife is bad medicine!

1485
01:46:08,554 --> 01:46:10,556
Here, just stop that drivel.
No.

1486
01:46:10,639 --> 01:46:14,564
Take the knife and
wait for tonight.

1487
01:46:19,398 --> 01:46:20,741
There he goes.

1488
01:46:24,820 --> 01:46:28,825
Wait until he's bedded down,
and then...

1489
01:46:37,541 --> 01:46:39,919
Give me a drink.

1490
01:46:40,002 --> 01:46:43,757
God bless my sister Ruth
and my brother Dave,

1491
01:46:43,839 --> 01:46:46,843
and make me a good girl,
and take care of us.

1492
01:46:48,803 --> 01:46:51,807
Aren't you going to ask God to
take care of Breck Coleman?

1493
01:46:51,889 --> 01:46:55,814
Oh, Zeke says that Breck Coleman
can take care of himself.

1494
01:47:15,246 --> 01:47:18,921
You overplayed
your hand that time, Lopez!

1495
01:47:33,138 --> 01:47:36,187
Zeke, this is
old Ben Griswell's knife.

1496
01:47:37,893 --> 01:47:39,486
Well, where'd you
find it, boy?

1497
01:47:39,562 --> 01:47:42,611
Lopez just left it
sticking in my bedroll.

1498
01:47:42,731 --> 01:47:45,701
Their having it makes it certain
that Flack and Lopez did it.

1499
01:47:45,776 --> 01:47:47,528
No question about it, boy.

1500
01:47:47,611 --> 01:47:48,828
What did they do, Coleman?

1501
01:47:48,904 --> 01:47:50,156
Killed my best friend.

1502
01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:52,116
I been on their
trail ever since.

1503
01:47:52,199 --> 01:47:53,997
That's a serious charge.

1504
01:47:54,076 --> 01:47:57,797
If you're sure, we'll call a settlers'
meeting in the morning to try 'em.

1505
01:47:57,872 --> 01:48:00,045
You can call a settlers'
meeting to bury 'em.

1506
01:48:00,124 --> 01:48:01,125
What do you mean?

1507
01:48:01,208 --> 01:48:03,586
That I kill my own rats!

1508
01:48:18,309 --> 01:48:21,563
They've jumped camp,
Zeke, and I'm off on their trail.

1509
01:48:21,645 --> 01:48:23,647
Breck, you can't leave us here!

1510
01:48:23,731 --> 01:48:25,574
You got to see us through.

1511
01:48:25,691 --> 01:48:27,534
He's right, boy.

1512
01:48:27,610 --> 01:48:30,454
Maybe so, the way
you all look at it.

1513
01:48:30,529 --> 01:48:33,328
But those two men
killed a man in cold blood,

1514
01:48:33,407 --> 01:48:36,377
and they've got to pay.

1515
01:48:36,452 --> 01:48:39,080
It's not that I've got
hatred in my heart,

1516
01:48:39,163 --> 01:48:41,416
but that I'm the law
out here, that's all.

1517
01:48:41,498 --> 01:48:43,842
And the law is justice.

1518
01:48:46,211 --> 01:48:50,591
Well, Zeke, I'll see 'em
to the end of the trail.

1519
01:48:50,674 --> 01:48:53,052
But then I'm picking up
a new trail here.

1520
01:49:13,364 --> 01:49:16,243
Get over! Get over!

1521
01:49:16,325 --> 01:49:17,417
Get over here!

1522
01:49:17,493 --> 01:49:18,494
Hah! Get over! Hah!

1523
01:49:18,577 --> 01:49:19,624
Get over!

1524
01:49:19,703 --> 01:49:20,750
Whoa, hah! Whoa, hah!

1525
01:49:20,829 --> 01:49:22,126
Whoa, hah!

1526
01:49:22,206 --> 01:49:23,833
Get over! Pull!

1527
01:49:30,547 --> 01:49:34,177
Yonder stands
the great white mountain.

1528
01:49:34,259 --> 01:49:37,103
And down below lies the
valley I've told you about.

1529
01:49:37,179 --> 01:49:40,900
Coleman, you have
fulfilled our hopes.

1530
01:49:41,892 --> 01:49:45,396
Neighbors!
Friends!

1531
01:49:45,479 --> 01:49:48,904
It is fitting that we give
thanks to the Almighty.

1532
01:49:52,027 --> 01:49:57,124
Our Father, we thank thee for
leading us to this land of promise,

1533
01:49:57,199 --> 01:49:59,122
for guiding our
footsteps safely

1534
01:49:59,201 --> 01:50:01,579
through the dangers
of our pilgrimage.

1535
01:50:02,079 --> 01:50:04,173
In this valley of
our dreams, we'll build

1536
01:50:04,248 --> 01:50:06,467
our homes and
serve thee, O Father.

1537
01:50:07,084 --> 01:50:10,634
And our children's children
shall praise thy name.

1538
01:50:10,713 --> 01:50:12,715
Amen.

1539
01:50:16,593 --> 01:50:20,723
The way is clear ahead.
All gentle slopes.

1540
01:50:20,806 --> 01:50:23,480
So drive down, my friends,
and settle it.

1541
01:50:23,559 --> 01:50:25,436
Lead the way.

1542
01:50:25,519 --> 01:50:27,567
Zeke will lead the way down.

1543
01:50:27,896 --> 01:50:29,523
Our trails fork here.

1544
01:50:29,606 --> 01:50:31,279
You mean you are
leaving us?

1545
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:36,538
There's a trail I've followed
for over 3,000 miles now,

1546
01:50:36,613 --> 01:50:40,368
and I'm headin' back to pick it up
again and follow it to the end.

1547
01:50:40,951 --> 01:50:43,204
Coleman,
you're the breed of man

1548
01:50:43,287 --> 01:50:46,006
that would follow
a trail to the end.

1549
01:50:46,081 --> 01:50:48,049
Thanks, Bascom.

1550
01:50:48,125 --> 01:50:50,298
Friends, we'll go on.

1551
01:50:50,544 --> 01:50:54,515
Boy, there's two of 'em.
Bad ones.

1552
01:50:54,590 --> 01:50:57,218
Now, I'm going with you.

1553
01:50:57,301 --> 01:50:59,645
No, Zeke.

1554
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:02,940
You stay here and look after
Ruth and her outfit.

1555
01:51:08,645 --> 01:51:11,819
Breck, you're not leaving.

1556
01:51:11,899 --> 01:51:14,152
Yes, Miss Ruth.
I'm pullin' out.

1557
01:51:14,234 --> 01:51:17,408
They say you're going to
hunt down Flack and Lopez.

1558
01:51:17,488 --> 01:51:18,785
That's what I aim to do.

1559
01:51:18,864 --> 01:51:20,741
But you can't do
this awful thing...

1560
01:51:20,824 --> 01:51:23,498
Take two lives!

1561
01:51:23,577 --> 01:51:26,251
It's frontier justice.

1562
01:51:26,330 --> 01:51:29,083
Don't go, Breck.
Don't go!

1563
01:51:29,166 --> 01:51:32,090
It's a job
I've got to finish.

1564
01:51:32,169 --> 01:51:34,547
But don't you see?

1565
01:51:34,630 --> 01:51:38,430
It doesn't matter about them.
I'm afraid for you.

1566
01:51:38,509 --> 01:51:40,511
They'll kill you!

1567
01:51:43,722 --> 01:51:47,226
You're everything
in the world to me, Breck.

1568
01:51:47,309 --> 01:51:50,688
I can't let you go!
I can't!

1569
01:51:52,773 --> 01:51:55,117
The thing has to be done.

1570
01:51:57,319 --> 01:51:59,242
Someday...

1571
01:52:00,239 --> 01:52:02,333
Somewhere...

1572
01:52:02,407 --> 01:52:05,081
Our trails will cross again.

1573
01:52:11,625 --> 01:52:14,504
Now, now.
Come, come, miss.

1574
01:52:14,586 --> 01:52:17,635
You mustn't be
a-carryin' on thataway.

1575
01:52:17,714 --> 01:52:21,139
He's gone.
He'll never come back.

1576
01:52:21,218 --> 01:52:24,893
Now, now, you just mustn't
do this, miss.

1577
01:52:24,972 --> 01:52:27,976
You'll have me a-blubberin'
here pretty soon.

1578
01:52:28,058 --> 01:52:31,562
I'm a-tellin' ya that everything
is going to be all right.

1579
01:52:31,645 --> 01:52:33,989
When spring comes
in that valley,

1580
01:52:34,064 --> 01:52:36,237
he'll be tracking back again.

1581
01:52:36,316 --> 01:52:40,162
I know that boy.
I know him.

1582
01:52:40,237 --> 01:52:44,162
Now, come, come.
Come on, Ruth.

1583
01:52:44,241 --> 01:52:45,538
Come on.

1584
01:53:10,726 --> 01:53:13,275
My legs are
froze to the knees.

1585
01:53:14,104 --> 01:53:15,356
I can't get up.

1586
01:53:15,439 --> 01:53:18,909
Yes, looks as if
you're done for, Lopez.

1587
01:53:18,984 --> 01:53:21,362
But, Flack, don't go away
and leave me, Flack.

1588
01:53:21,445 --> 01:53:24,870
What? Do you think
I'm staying here?

1589
01:53:24,948 --> 01:53:26,700
Well, then leave me a blanket!
I'm frozen.

1590
01:53:26,783 --> 01:53:28,501
Ah, won't do you no good.

1591
01:53:28,577 --> 01:53:31,171
You'll be froze to
death in an hour.

1592
01:53:31,246 --> 01:53:32,293
Flack!

1593
01:53:32,372 --> 01:53:33,373
It may help me.
Now get away.

1594
01:53:33,457 --> 01:53:34,629
Flack! Flack!

1595
01:53:35,918 --> 01:53:39,639
Flack, don't let me
die alone!

1596
01:53:39,713 --> 01:53:41,715
Stay with me! Flack!

1597
01:53:46,678 --> 01:53:50,023
Flack!

1598
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:17,542
Well, Lopez.

1599
01:54:17,626 --> 01:54:20,425
It won't be long
before you have company.

1600
01:55:08,218 --> 01:55:10,312
Flack!

1601
01:55:50,427 --> 01:55:52,350
Yeah, Milt.

1602
01:55:52,429 --> 01:55:55,774
I got a hankerin' to trail
on down into Mexico.

1603
01:55:55,849 --> 01:55:57,351
Old Bill Gillie
done told me

1604
01:55:57,434 --> 01:56:01,484
that them there black-eyed
gals is just full of fire.

1605
01:56:01,563 --> 01:56:02,689
Zeke?
Yeah?

1606
01:56:02,773 --> 01:56:04,320
Zeke, you're not
really leaving us?

1607
01:56:04,733 --> 01:56:08,783
Yeah, gal, I'm a-pullin' out. You
is all nice and settled now.

1608
01:56:08,862 --> 01:56:10,114
And this here
valley is gettin'

1609
01:56:10,197 --> 01:56:12,746
altogether too
civilized for me.

1610
01:56:12,824 --> 01:56:14,542
Whenever I get more
than three or four families

1611
01:56:14,618 --> 01:56:15,870
within a hundred mile
of me,

1612
01:56:15,952 --> 01:56:18,580
I begin to feel
kind of crowded.

1613
01:56:18,663 --> 01:56:21,257
That's not why
you're going, Zeke.

1614
01:56:21,333 --> 01:56:24,678
No? Why else, gal?

1615
01:56:24,753 --> 01:56:29,179
Breck has never come back. You're
going out to look for him.

1616
01:56:29,257 --> 01:56:31,555
Now, wherever that boy
Breck Coleman is at,

1617
01:56:31,635 --> 01:56:33,808
he's a-lookin'
out for hisself.

1618
01:56:33,887 --> 01:56:36,060
Now don't you
fret about him.

1619
01:56:43,605 --> 01:56:46,233
Did you give
away all your little puppies?

1620
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:55,413
Why are you
looking at that dress?

1621
01:56:57,411 --> 01:57:00,130
This is
the anniversary of the...

1622
01:57:00,205 --> 01:57:03,709
The day that the wagon
train left from Missouri.

1623
01:57:05,335 --> 01:57:07,963
Last time I had this on,

1624
01:57:08,046 --> 01:57:10,640
I was sitting in
the Riggses' cabin.

1625
01:57:10,715 --> 01:57:12,934
In a rocking chair?

1626
01:57:13,009 --> 01:57:15,011
Yes, Honey Girl.

1627
01:57:16,555 --> 01:57:18,557
In a rocking chair.

1628
01:57:28,775 --> 01:57:30,277
Zeke, I reckon
that's a panther.

1629
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:33,113
Yeah!
It's a two-legged panther.

1630
01:57:33,196 --> 01:57:36,951
The only kind whatever gimme
that Comanche yell as a signal.

1631
01:57:37,033 --> 01:57:40,628
We might just as well
start to unpack.

1632
01:57:40,704 --> 01:57:42,251
What, ain't you going?

1633
01:57:42,330 --> 01:57:43,798
No use of going now.

1634
01:57:43,874 --> 01:57:47,344
He's only a bit up in the timber
there, and he's a-headed this way.

1635
01:57:47,419 --> 01:57:49,797
Zeke, won't you stay over
for the anniversary?

1636
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:50,927
Yes, gal, I'll stay.

1637
01:57:51,006 --> 01:57:52,007
Aw!

1638
01:57:52,090 --> 01:57:54,889
And I just recollected, I got
a little present for you.

1639
01:57:54,968 --> 01:57:56,220
Oh, Zeke, what is it?

1640
01:57:56,303 --> 01:57:59,603
Well, a young fella named Breck
Coleman left it with me,

1641
01:57:59,681 --> 01:58:03,902
and he told me to give it to
you in case he didn't show up.

1642
01:58:03,977 --> 01:58:04,978
Where is it, Zeke?

1643
01:58:05,061 --> 01:58:08,986
I hid it in the holler of the big
tree at the bend of the trail.

1644
01:58:09,065 --> 01:58:11,318
You'll find it there.

1645
01:58:11,401 --> 01:58:13,574
Thanks, Zeke.
I'll go get it.

1646
02:01:40,752 --> 02:01:41,753
English - US - SDH
