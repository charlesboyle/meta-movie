00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:18,000
JFK

1
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,459
"To sin by silence when we should protest
makes cowards out of men."

2
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:25,355
- Ella Wheeler Wilcox

3
00:00:53,316 --> 00:00:56,672
JFK

4
00:00:57,902 --> 00:00:59,381
January, 1961.

5
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:03,581
President Dwight D. Eisenhower's
Farewell Address to the Nation.

6
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:08,994
This conjunction of an immense military
establishment and arms industry is new...

7
00:01:09,744 --> 00:01:11,655
...in the American experience.

8
00:01:11,828 --> 00:01:13,386
The total influence...

9
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:16,097
...economic, political, even spiritual...

10
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,192
...is felt in every city, every Statehouse,
every government office.

11
00:01:22,252 --> 00:01:24,561
We must guard against the acquisition...

12
00:01:24,754 --> 00:01:28,383
...of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought...

13
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:31,270
...by the military-industrial complex.

14
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,393
We must never let the weight
of this combination...

15
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,347
...endanger our liberties
or democratic processes.

16
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,408
November, 1960.

17
00:01:40,973 --> 00:01:43,692
Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy
of Massachusetts...

18
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:47,373
...wins one of the narrowest election
victories in American history...

19
00:01:47,602 --> 00:01:51,959
...over Vice President Richard Nixon
by a little more than 100,000 votes.

20
00:01:52,815 --> 00:01:56,603
Alongside his beautiful
and elegant wife, Jacqueline Bouvier...

21
00:01:56,942 --> 00:02:00,457
...Kennedy is the symbol
of the new freedom of the 1960s...

22
00:02:00,778 --> 00:02:03,929
...signifying change and upheaval
to the American public.

23
00:02:04,155 --> 00:02:05,827
"All men are created equal."

24
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,107
Every degree of mind and spirit
that I possess will be devoted...

25
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:11,643
...to the cause of freedom
around the world.

26
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:14,023
Today, the proudest boast is:

27
00:02:14,454 --> 00:02:16,251
"Ich bin ein Berliner!"

28
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:21,961
He inherits a secret war against the
Communist Castro dictatorship in Cuba...

29
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:25,371
...a war run by the CIA
and angry Cuban exiles.

30
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:28,313
Castro is a successful revolutionary...

31
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:31,782
...frightening to American business
interests in Latin America.

32
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:35,318
This war culminates in the disastrous
Bay of Pigs invasion...

33
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:37,387
...in April, 1961...

34
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,282
...when Kennedy refuses to provide
air cover for the exiled Cuban brigade.

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,837
Kennedy takes public responsibility
for the failure.

36
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:48,820
He privately claims the CIA lied to him...

37
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,251
...and tried to manipulate him into ordering
an American invasion of Cuba.

38
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:57,146
In October, 1962...

39
00:02:57,692 --> 00:03:00,331
...the world comes to the brink
of nuclear war...

40
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:02,358
...when Kennedy quarantines Cuba...

41
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:06,487
...after announcing the presence
of offensive Soviet nuclear missiles...

42
00:03:06,865 --> 00:03:08,856
...90 miles off American shores.

43
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:12,070
Soviet ships with more missiles
sail towards Cuba...

44
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,688
...but at the last moment they turn back.

45
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,065
The world breathes with relief.

46
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:21,251
In Washington, rumors abound
that JFK has cut a secret deal...

47
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,494
...with Russian Premier Khrushchev...

48
00:03:23,668 --> 00:03:27,900
...not to invade Cuba in return
for a Russian withdrawal of missiles.

49
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:31,731
Suspicions abound that Kennedy
is soft on communism.

50
00:03:33,216 --> 00:03:36,811
Kennedy also finds himself embroiled
in Laos and Vietnam.

51
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,414
We've got our difficulties there.

52
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:42,474
Unless a greater effort is made
by the government...

53
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:46,276
...to win popular support,
I don't think the war can be won there.

54
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,275
It's their war. They're the ones
who have to win it or lose it.

55
00:03:50,686 --> 00:03:52,244
Early that fateful summer...

56
00:03:52,396 --> 00:03:55,786
...Kennedy speaks of his new vision
at the American University.

57
00:03:56,064 --> 00:03:57,577
What kind of peace do I mean?

58
00:03:57,733 --> 00:03:59,644
What kind of peace do we seek?

59
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:01,417
Not a Pax Americana...

60
00:04:01,861 --> 00:04:05,171
...enforced on the world
by American weapons of war.

61
00:04:05,738 --> 00:04:09,413
We must re-examine our own attitudes
towards the Soviet Union.

62
00:04:10,074 --> 00:04:11,951
Our most basic, common link...

63
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:14,490
...is that we all inhabit...

64
00:04:14,744 --> 00:04:16,257
...this small planet.

65
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:18,501
We all breathe the same air.

66
00:04:18,914 --> 00:04:21,269
We all cherish our children's futures.

67
00:04:21,707 --> 00:04:23,538
And we are all mortal.

68
00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:35,676
You fucking assholes!

69
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,239
Don't leave me here!

70
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,749
They've gone to Dallas.

71
00:04:45,557 --> 00:04:46,512
Friday.

72
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:51,182
They're going to kill...

73
00:04:51,728 --> 00:04:53,002
...Kennedy.

74
00:04:54,897 --> 00:04:56,376
Call somebody.

75
00:04:57,815 --> 00:04:58,930
Stop them.

76
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,046
These are serious fucking guys.

77
00:05:11,283 --> 00:05:14,480
She's been high on something
since they brought her in.

78
00:05:14,785 --> 00:05:15,900
Help!

79
00:05:16,703 --> 00:05:17,772
Please!

80
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:29,914
DALLAS - NOVEMBER 22, 1963

81
00:06:17,703 --> 00:06:18,772
WANTED FOR TREASON

82
00:07:10,989 --> 00:07:12,058
CBS NEWS BULLETIN

83
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,560
Here is a bulletin from CBS News.

84
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:18,093
In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired...

85
00:07:18,286 --> 00:07:21,278
...at President Kennedy's motorcade
in downtown Dallas.

86
00:07:21,497 --> 00:07:23,806
The first reports say
that President Kennedy...

87
00:07:23,998 --> 00:07:26,592
...has been seriously wounded
by the shooting.

88
00:07:34,797 --> 00:07:37,516
New Orleans

89
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:40,325
OFFICE OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY

90
00:07:49,891 --> 00:07:51,040
What's wrong?

91
00:07:53,018 --> 00:07:54,736
The President's been shot.

92
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,181
In Dallas. Five minutes ago.

93
00:07:57,688 --> 00:07:58,882
Oh, no!

94
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:02,851
How bad?

95
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,792
No word. They think it's in the head.

96
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,171
Napoleon's has a TV set.

97
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:21,513
Three bullets were found. Gov. Connally
also appeared to have been hit.

98
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:26,516
The President was rushed to Parkland
Memorial Hospital, four miles away.

99
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:31,087
We are told the bullet entered the base
of the throat and came out the back...

100
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:33,531
...but there is no confirmation.

101
00:08:33,837 --> 00:08:37,955
Blood transfusions are being given.
A priest has administered the last rites.

102
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:42,689
There's still a chance.

103
00:08:44,595 --> 00:08:45,914
Pull through, Jack.

104
00:08:46,054 --> 00:08:47,123
From Dallas...

105
00:08:47,264 --> 00:08:49,334
...the flash, apparently official:

106
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:51,395
President Kennedy died...

107
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:54,406
...at 1:00 p.m. Central Standard Time...

108
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,505
...2:00 Eastern Standard Time...

109
00:08:58,229 --> 00:09:00,140
...some 38 minutes ago.

110
00:09:05,775 --> 00:09:08,289
Vice President Johnson
has left the hospital.

111
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:12,259
Presumably he will take
the oath of office shortly...

112
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,216
...and become the 36th President
of the United States.

113
00:09:17,742 --> 00:09:21,894
He did so much for this country,
for colored people. Why?

114
00:09:26,415 --> 00:09:29,134
Good-bye, you sorry bastard! Die!

115
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:31,389
Shut the fuck up!

116
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:35,433
I'm ashamed to be an American today.

117
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:38,633
The President of the United States is dead.

118
00:09:39,758 --> 00:09:44,195
I just talked to Father Oscar Hubert
of the Holy Trinity Catholic Church.

119
00:09:44,803 --> 00:09:46,236
He told me...

120
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:50,592
...President Kennedy has been given
the last rites.

121
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:52,762
Shortly after 12:30...

122
00:09:54,934 --> 00:09:57,164
...near the park in downtown Dallas...

123
00:09:57,352 --> 00:09:58,910
...the shots rang out.

124
00:09:59,604 --> 00:10:01,435
The President is dead.

125
00:10:02,856 --> 00:10:05,051
The bullets came up over our heads...

126
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:08,285
...from that fence up on the knoll.

127
00:10:08,777 --> 00:10:10,927
I seen his face when it hit.

128
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:16,082
His ear blew off and he turned real white.

129
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:21,726
He flopped over on his stomach...

130
00:10:24,412 --> 00:10:26,323
...with his foot sticking out.

131
00:10:28,832 --> 00:10:32,507
None of us thought it could happen
in America or any place else.

132
00:10:32,877 --> 00:10:36,028
All this blubbering over
that no-count son of a bitch!

133
00:10:36,463 --> 00:10:39,819
They're bawling like they knew the man.
Makes me want to puke.

134
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:43,438
For God's sake, the President was shot.

135
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,435
A bullshit President!

136
00:10:45,843 --> 00:10:49,040
Nobody's crying for the thousands
of Cubans...

137
00:10:49,721 --> 00:10:53,111
...that bastard condemned to death
and torture at Bay of Pigs.

138
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:56,219
Goddamn peace treaties!

139
00:10:56,435 --> 00:10:58,346
I heard shots from over there.

140
00:10:58,936 --> 00:11:02,326
- I heard shots from over there.
- How many?

141
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:06,112
That's what happens
when you let the niggers vote.

142
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:10,153
They get together with the Jews
and the Catholics...

143
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:12,883
...and elect an Irish bleeding heart.

144
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,634
Chief, maybe you had too much to drink.

145
00:11:15,823 --> 00:11:17,097
Bullshit!

146
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:19,451
Here's to the New Frontier.

147
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:22,570
Camelot in smithereens.

148
00:11:23,953 --> 00:11:25,591
I'll drink to that.

149
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,191
Dallas police have just announced...

150
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:38,291
...they have a suspect in the killing
of Dallas policeman J.D. Tippit...

151
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,275
...who was shot at 1: 15 in Oak Cliff,
a Dallas suburb.

152
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:46,795
Police say there could be a tie-in
to the President's murder.

153
00:11:47,052 --> 00:11:50,203
The suspect,
identified as a Lee Harvey Oswald...

154
00:11:51,013 --> 00:11:53,652
...was arrested by more
than a dozen policemen...

155
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:57,398
...after a short scuffle at a movie theater
in Oak Cliff.

156
00:11:58,894 --> 00:12:00,725
Officer Tippit was killed...

157
00:12:01,937 --> 00:12:04,405
...by a revolver which was found
on Oswald.

158
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:07,915
Shoot the bastard!

159
00:12:08,108 --> 00:12:10,383
Give him a medal for shooting Kennedy!

160
00:12:13,612 --> 00:12:15,728
I don't know what I am charged with...

161
00:12:16,363 --> 00:12:18,354
...but I emphatically deny these charges.

162
00:12:20,742 --> 00:12:23,131
The kid must've gone nuts, right?

163
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,898
I said, Oswald must've flipped.

164
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,277
Right?

165
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:32,729
Just did this crazy thing
before anybody could stop him.

166
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:35,686
I'm going. I've got to get home, Chief.

167
00:12:36,003 --> 00:12:38,039
What are you talking about?

168
00:12:38,796 --> 00:12:40,468
Who'd have ever thought...

169
00:12:41,131 --> 00:12:45,204
...that goofy Oswald kid would pull
a stunt like an assassination?

170
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:49,922
Goes to show you can never know
about some people. Am I right, Jack?

171
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:51,862
Am I right, Jack?

172
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,932
Well, bless my soul.

173
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:58,094
All these years,
I thought you were on my team.

174
00:12:58,893 --> 00:13:00,485
Are you kidding?

175
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,908
I couldn't be more serious, Jack.

176
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,995
Your little red eyes have me wondering
about your loyalty.

177
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:18,369
Look at that, Martin.

178
00:13:21,825 --> 00:13:23,895
Who's been going through my files?

179
00:13:24,327 --> 00:13:27,399
You've been looking through my files,
you little weasel!

180
00:13:28,288 --> 00:13:31,086
You're starting to get paranoid. Really!

181
00:13:32,457 --> 00:13:34,368
You went through all my files!

182
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,194
You're a goddamn spy!

183
00:13:36,335 --> 00:13:38,803
Why would I want to look
through your files?

184
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,968
I've seen enough here this summer
to write a book.

185
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:44,292
I always lock my files!

186
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,711
You're the only one here today.

187
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,656
What do you mean, you bastard?

188
00:13:50,303 --> 00:13:52,339
You're going to write a book?

189
00:13:52,513 --> 00:13:54,265
You know what I mean.

190
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,529
I've seen a lot of strange things here.

191
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:00,492
Strange people.

192
00:14:09,024 --> 00:14:11,299
You didn't see a goddamn thing!

193
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,050
Not a goddamn thing!

194
00:14:13,527 --> 00:14:15,757
The full name is Lee Harvey Oswald.

195
00:14:17,613 --> 00:14:21,003
- Did you shoot the President?
- I didn't shoot anybody.

196
00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:25,362
They have taken me in
because I have lived in the Soviet Union.

197
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:28,299
I'm just a patsy!

198
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:31,149
He sure looks like a creep.

199
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:35,873
I protested at that time I was not allowed
legal representation...

200
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,418
...during that very short and sweet hearing.

201
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,729
I really don't know...

202
00:14:42,964 --> 00:14:44,682
...what this situation is about.

203
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,877
Nobody has told me anything
except that I am accused...

204
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:50,269
...of murdering a policeman.

205
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,019
I know nothing more than that.

206
00:14:52,178 --> 00:14:55,727
I do request someone to come forward...

207
00:14:56,348 --> 00:14:58,418
...to give me legal assistance.

208
00:14:58,683 --> 00:15:01,675
Were you ever in the Free Cuba movement
or whatever it's called?

209
00:15:01,893 --> 00:15:04,168
It's the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

210
00:15:04,895 --> 00:15:07,284
Why were you in Russia?
What happened to your eye?

211
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,278
He seems pretty cool
for a man under pressure.

212
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:12,166
A policeman hit me.

213
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:13,711
He gives me the willies.

214
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,818
Come on, sugarplums,
it's past your bedtimes.

215
00:15:17,821 --> 00:15:21,336
Mattie, honey, get a hold of yourself.

216
00:15:25,076 --> 00:15:26,429
A fine man.

217
00:15:28,203 --> 00:15:30,080
After a stint in the Marines...

218
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:34,398
...he became fascinated by communism.
He is said to be a dedicated Marxist...

219
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,110
...and a fanatical supporter of Fidel Castro
and ultra left-wing causes.

220
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:42,426
He spent last summer in New Orleans
and was arrested...

221
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:45,189
...in a brawl with anti-Castro Cuban exiles.

222
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:51,561
Lou? Sorry to disturb you this late.

223
00:15:52,428 --> 00:15:56,262
Matter of routine. Get on
this Oswald connection in New Orleans.

224
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:01,212
Check out his record. Find any friends
or associates from last summer.

225
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:05,165
Let's meet with the investigators
day after tomorrow.

226
00:16:06,104 --> 00:16:07,253
On Sunday?

227
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:08,910
Sunday. 11:00.

228
00:16:10,107 --> 00:16:11,256
Thanks, Lou.

229
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:14,038
I would say that he is the killer...

230
00:16:14,777 --> 00:16:17,894
...beyond a reasonable doubt
and to a moral certainty.

231
00:16:18,654 --> 00:16:22,010
I thought a motorcycle had backfired.
I looked to my left.

232
00:16:22,407 --> 00:16:24,398
A second shot hit him in the face.

233
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:29,365
The rifle, a cheap World War II,
Italian-made Mannlicher-Carcano...

234
00:16:29,662 --> 00:16:32,051
...was ordered from
a Chicago mailing house...

235
00:16:32,247 --> 00:16:35,284
...and shipped to Oswald's alias, A. Hidell...

236
00:16:35,832 --> 00:16:38,551
...at a post office box in March of 1963.

237
00:16:38,835 --> 00:16:42,271
This same rifle was used
to assassinate the President.

238
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,345
That ties it up.

239
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,683
Another nut. Jesus Christ,
anybody can get a rifle in Texas!

240
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:53,399
As far as Oswald's associates,
one name keeps popping up: David Ferrie.

241
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:56,889
Oswald was seen with him
several times last summer.

242
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:00,426
I know David. Strange character.

243
00:17:00,641 --> 00:17:04,190
He's been in trouble before. He was
a hot-shot pilot for Eastern Airlines.

244
00:17:04,435 --> 00:17:07,154
Got canned after an alleged
homosexual incident.

245
00:17:07,396 --> 00:17:11,230
These photos were found yesterday
among Oswald's possessions...

246
00:17:11,523 --> 00:17:15,402
...in the garage where Marina Oswald
and her children are living.

247
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:19,405
Somebody mentioned Ferrie
on that Texas trip. Find that out.

248
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:21,789
He no shoot anyone.

249
00:17:22,614 --> 00:17:24,570
He good man. Good husband.

250
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:29,200
So it seems David Ferrie drove off
on Friday afternoon for Texas.

251
00:17:29,702 --> 00:17:33,012
A source said he might have been
a getaway pilot for Oswald.

252
00:17:34,622 --> 00:17:36,055
Hold your horses.

253
00:17:36,207 --> 00:17:37,799
What kind of source?

254
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,116
The anonymous kind, Chief.

255
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,135
I remember Ferrie speaking
at a meeting of some veterans' group...

256
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:47,295
...ranting against Castro. Extreme stuff.

257
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:52,340
They're bringing him out.
Numa, turn it up.

258
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,784
Here he comes!

259
00:18:00,598 --> 00:18:02,589
Anything to say in your defense?

260
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,544
Oswald!

261
00:18:06,645 --> 00:18:07,839
He shot him!

262
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,583
He shot him on TV!

263
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:16,545
There's a man with a gun!

264
00:18:18,653 --> 00:18:21,042
Seventy cops there.
What were they doing?

265
00:18:22,947 --> 00:18:27,225
No trial now. Somebody just saved
the Dallas DA a pile of work.

266
00:18:33,454 --> 00:18:36,014
Let's get David Ferrie in here anyway.

267
00:18:36,581 --> 00:18:38,651
It's wrong. This is crazy!

268
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:57,552
Yesterday, in the midst of sorrow,
the business of government went on.

269
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:02,377
The President met with Henry Cabot Lodge,
our Ambassador to Vietnam...

270
00:19:03,224 --> 00:19:04,782
...and members of his Cabinet.

271
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:06,925
The major subject was Vietnam...

272
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,029
...a crisis that does not pause
for bereavement.

273
00:19:10,271 --> 00:19:11,590
From this meeting...

274
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,769
...came affirmations that
the US would continue aiding...

275
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:20,303
...the new government of Vietnam in
its war against the Communist insurgents.

276
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:28,807
David Ferrie.

277
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:31,650
Come on in.

278
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,223
Thanks for coming.

279
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,522
Remember me? We met
on Carondelet Street after your election.

280
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:42,086
I remember.
You make quite an impression.

281
00:19:42,543 --> 00:19:45,137
I've heard you're a first-rate pilot.

282
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:49,563
Legend has it you can get in
and out of the smallest field.

283
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:54,249
I'm a pilot myself. Flew grasshoppers
for the field artillery in the war.

284
00:19:55,385 --> 00:19:57,057
Make yourself comfortable.

285
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:00,571
Mind if I smoke?

286
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:02,413
How could I?

287
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,750
As you know, President Kennedy
was assassinated on Friday.

288
00:20:06,976 --> 00:20:10,127
A man named Lee Harvey Oswald
was arrested as a suspect...

289
00:20:10,562 --> 00:20:13,474
...then murdered yesterday
by a man named Jack Ruby.

290
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:17,272
We've had reports that Oswald
spent the summer here...

291
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:19,520
...and that you knew Oswald.

292
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,312
I've never met anyone named Oswald.
Anyone who told you that has to be crazy.

293
00:20:24,572 --> 00:20:28,008
He served in your Civil Air Patrol unit
when he was a teenager.

294
00:20:28,907 --> 00:20:30,943
If he did, I don't remember him.

295
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,548
Lots of boys in and out.

296
00:20:33,827 --> 00:20:37,456
Surely you've seen this. Perhaps
you knew him under another name?

297
00:20:40,332 --> 00:20:42,402
I never saw him before in my life.

298
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:46,679
Then we must have gotten
mistaken information.

299
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:49,203
Thanks for straightening it out.

300
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,331
There's one other matter.

301
00:20:55,551 --> 00:20:59,783
We heard you went to Texas
shortly after the assassination on Friday.

302
00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:02,427
True. I drove to Houston.

303
00:21:02,806 --> 00:21:04,956
What was so appealing about Houston?

304
00:21:05,391 --> 00:21:08,827
I hadn't been ice-skating lately.
Some young friends and I...

305
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,024
...decided to go skating.

306
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,662
Why the urge to ice-skate in Texas...

307
00:21:13,896 --> 00:21:17,093
...during one of the worst thunderstorms
in recent memory?

308
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:21,781
Spur-of-the-moment thing.

309
00:21:21,986 --> 00:21:23,624
Storm wasn't that bad.

310
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,213
Where did you drive?

311
00:21:27,364 --> 00:21:28,479
We went to Houston.

312
00:21:29,491 --> 00:21:32,005
Saturday we drove to Galveston,
and stayed there.

313
00:21:32,576 --> 00:21:33,929
And Sunday?

314
00:21:34,953 --> 00:21:37,228
In the morning, we went goose hunting.

315
00:21:37,913 --> 00:21:39,187
Did you bag any?

316
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:41,631
The boys got a couple.

317
00:21:41,874 --> 00:21:43,751
Boys said they didn't get any.

318
00:21:47,336 --> 00:21:48,530
They're right.

319
00:21:48,837 --> 00:21:52,386
There were thousands
of geese everywhere.

320
00:21:53,716 --> 00:21:56,435
But you couldn't approach them.
They're wise.

321
00:21:58,052 --> 00:22:00,612
Your friends said you had no weapons.

322
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:04,466
Isn't it difficult to hunt geese
without a shotgun?

323
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:11,849
I remember now. I'm sorry.

324
00:22:12,603 --> 00:22:13,797
I got confused.

325
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:18,097
We got near the geese, then realized
we had forgotten our shotguns.

326
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,628
Stupid, right?

327
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:24,158
So, of course, we didn't get any geese.

328
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:27,234
Thank you for your time.

329
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,606
Sorry this must end inconveniently...

330
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:34,093
...but I must detain you for questioning
by the FBI.

331
00:22:34,993 --> 00:22:36,187
Why? What's wrong?

332
00:22:36,328 --> 00:22:38,205
Your story is not believable.

333
00:22:40,163 --> 00:22:41,357
Really?

334
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,024
What part?

335
00:23:05,889 --> 00:23:09,086
This afternoon the FBI released
David W. Ferrie...

336
00:23:09,851 --> 00:23:11,125
...of New Orleans.

337
00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:14,227
After extensive questioning
and a background check...

338
00:23:14,437 --> 00:23:18,874
...the Bureau found no evidence
that Mr. Ferrie knew Lee Harvey Oswald...

339
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:23,183
...or had any connection
with the assassination.

340
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,159
The agent in charge would like
to make clear...

341
00:23:27,737 --> 00:23:30,205
...that Ferrie was brought in
for questioning...

342
00:23:30,407 --> 00:23:33,126
...by the District Attorney
of Orleans Parish.

343
00:23:34,075 --> 00:23:36,191
I thought we were on the same side.

344
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,082
Why are they saying that?

345
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:40,559
Pretty fast, the way they let him go.

346
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:43,609
They must know something we don't.

347
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:46,828
So let's get on with our lives.

348
00:23:47,543 --> 00:23:49,613
We have many homegrown crimes
to prosecute.

349
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,353
The President has announced...

350
00:23:51,504 --> 00:23:54,894
...the creation of a commission
to probe the events in Dallas.

351
00:23:56,424 --> 00:23:59,575
It will be headed
by Chief Justice Earl Warren...

352
00:24:00,552 --> 00:24:04,864
...and is expected to head off
several Congressional and Texas inquiries.

353
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,388
On the panel are Allen Dulles,
ex-chief of the CIA...

354
00:24:08,891 --> 00:24:12,247
...Representative Gerald Ford,
banker John McCloy...

355
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:16,678
Three Years Later

356
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:21,174
Fucking out of control.
All these hippies running around on drugs.

357
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:24,989
You can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.

358
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:30,343
I saw a girl the other day. Pregnant.
You could see her whole belly.

359
00:24:31,031 --> 00:24:34,228
You know what she had painted on it?
"Love Child."

360
00:24:37,827 --> 00:24:40,136
Johnson Seeks $9 Billion
In Extra Viet War Funds

361
00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:41,887
It's a mess down there, Jim.

362
00:24:42,331 --> 00:24:45,368
We've bitten off more Vietnam
than we can chew.

363
00:24:45,707 --> 00:24:49,177
It figures with that polecat Lyndon
in the White House.

364
00:24:51,086 --> 00:24:54,999
I sometimes think things have gone
downhill since Kennedy died.

365
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:57,891
Don't get me started on that.

366
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:01,803
Those Warren Commission fellows
were picking gnat shit out of pepper.

367
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:06,178
Nobody's going to tell me that kid
shot like he did from that bookstore.

368
00:25:09,057 --> 00:25:12,174
But the FBI test-fired the rifle
to see if it could be done.

369
00:25:12,392 --> 00:25:15,190
Three experts and not one
of them could do it.

370
00:25:15,812 --> 00:25:19,771
They say that Oswald got off three shots
with world-class precision...

371
00:25:20,356 --> 00:25:23,666
...from a manual bolt-action rifle
in less than six seconds.

372
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:27,385
According to his Marine buddies,
he got Maggie's drawers.

373
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:30,091
That means he wasn't any good.

374
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:33,131
Average man would be lucky
to shoot twice.

375
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,632
And the first would be the best.

376
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:38,244
Here the third shot's perfect.

377
00:25:38,577 --> 00:25:41,455
And they got that bullet zigzagging
all over the place...

378
00:25:41,663 --> 00:25:43,779
...hitting Kennedy and Connally
seven times.

379
00:25:45,373 --> 00:25:48,206
One pristine bullet? That dog don't hunt.

380
00:25:51,294 --> 00:25:54,331
Something's always bothered me
about that from day one.

381
00:25:55,714 --> 00:25:57,944
Think other men were involved?

382
00:25:59,008 --> 00:26:03,320
If I was investigating the case, I'd round up
100 of the world's best riflemen...

383
00:26:03,969 --> 00:26:06,483
...and find out which ones were
in Dallas that day.

384
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:10,035
You been duck hunting.
Oswald's an old-fashioned decoy.

385
00:26:10,391 --> 00:26:13,542
What did he say? "I'm just a patsy!"
Believe it.

386
00:26:25,692 --> 00:26:27,728
Dinner's just about ready.

387
00:26:29,362 --> 00:26:32,672
Got a surprise for you tonight.
Tried something new.

388
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:40,806
- What?
- Dinner.

389
00:26:42,412 --> 00:26:44,607
Smells good. Do you know Oswald...

390
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:47,861
...was interrogated for 12 hours
after the assassination...

391
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:51,837
...with no lawyer present,
and nobody recorded a word of it.

392
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:57,159
I can't believe it. An experienced
police captain and a crowd of FBI agents...

393
00:26:57,423 --> 00:27:01,621
...had to know that with no record,
what Oswald said is inadmissible in court.

394
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,070
Let's talk at the table. It's getting cold.

395
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,142
What are you doing here?

396
00:27:07,554 --> 00:27:09,670
Daddy said it's okay if I'm quiet.

397
00:27:10,223 --> 00:27:11,338
Sure it is.

398
00:27:11,557 --> 00:27:14,594
If I handled a minor felon that way,
it'd be all over the papers.

399
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:16,879
This is the alleged murderer
of the President.

400
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:26,614
Again and again
credible testimony's ignored.

401
00:27:27,276 --> 00:27:31,747
Leads are not followed up,
conclusions are selective, no index.

402
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:35,578
It's the sloppiest investigation
I've ever seen.

403
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:39,979
Dozens of witnesses heard the shots...

404
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:42,837
...coming from the grassy knoll
in front of Kennedy...

405
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:45,346
...not the Book Depository behind him.

406
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:50,120
But it's broken down and spread around.
You read it, but the point is lost.

407
00:27:50,917 --> 00:27:52,475
I never believed it.

408
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:55,683
I'll do the dishes. You take Eb up.

409
00:27:57,213 --> 00:27:59,329
Elizabeth, your bedtime too!

410
00:27:59,882 --> 00:28:03,636
That was three years ago.
We've tried to put it out of our minds.

411
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:05,844
You keep digging it up.

412
00:28:06,512 --> 00:28:08,309
You're the DA of New Orleans.

413
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:11,621
Isn't the Kennedy assassination
a bit out of your domain?

414
00:28:12,682 --> 00:28:14,638
All those important people studied it.

415
00:28:14,808 --> 00:28:18,767
I can't believe a man as intelligent
as Earl Warren read those volumes.

416
00:28:20,771 --> 00:28:22,204
Maybe you're right.

417
00:28:22,688 --> 00:28:26,806
You got an hour to solve the case
while I get the kids in bed.

418
00:28:27,858 --> 00:28:31,373
Then you're mine. Mr. Kennedy
will have to wait until morning.

419
00:28:36,656 --> 00:28:38,851
Look, Dad. Look what I drew.

420
00:28:39,241 --> 00:28:41,152
That's something. What is it?

421
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,082
It's a rhino in a cage.

422
00:28:43,703 --> 00:28:46,501
- Can I stay up another hour?
- I don't think so, Son.

423
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:48,900
Pickle and Snapper, my two...

424
00:28:50,124 --> 00:28:51,352
...dancing partners.

425
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,411
Good night, doodlebugs.

426
00:28:54,294 --> 00:28:56,012
One hour, you hear?

427
00:28:56,796 --> 00:28:58,866
Some Saturday-night date you are.

428
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:03,730
Mama warned me this would happen
if I married such a serious man as you.

429
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,979
When I come up, I'll show you
how Saturday night got invented.

430
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,802
I sealed off the area and held off the trains
till they could be examined.

431
00:29:37,323 --> 00:29:40,554
There were some transients taken on
at least one train.

432
00:29:42,535 --> 00:29:47,529
Mr. Bowers, you already talked to us
about this matter. Is that correct?

433
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,990
Yes.

434
00:29:49,415 --> 00:29:51,565
Is there anything else you told us...

435
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,901
...that I haven't asked you about,
that you can think of?

436
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,929
Nothing that I can recall.

437
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,518
Witness is excused.

438
00:30:02,381 --> 00:30:03,734
A long freight was in there...

439
00:30:03,883 --> 00:30:06,761
...and we pulled some people off
and took them to the station.

440
00:30:10,804 --> 00:30:12,317
Do you mean some transients?

441
00:30:12,764 --> 00:30:14,083
Tramps and hobos.

442
00:30:14,223 --> 00:30:15,736
Were they questioned?

443
00:30:16,058 --> 00:30:18,333
They were questioned at the station.

444
00:30:19,476 --> 00:30:20,829
Ask the question.

445
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,287
Let's go back to that Amos Euins matter.

446
00:30:25,939 --> 00:30:29,488
Traffic had been cut off
into the area since 10:00.

447
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:33,090
But three cars came in during this time...

448
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,118
...from around noon till the time
of the shooting.

449
00:30:37,739 --> 00:30:40,173
They circled the parking lot and left.

450
00:30:40,824 --> 00:30:42,815
Like they was checking the area.

451
00:30:44,035 --> 00:30:45,627
One of the drivers...

452
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:48,550
...was holding something up to his mouth.

453
00:30:50,414 --> 00:30:56,011
The last car came in about seven
to ten minutes before the shooting.

454
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,043
It was a white Chevrolet four-door Impala.

455
00:31:01,172 --> 00:31:02,810
Muddy up to the windows.

456
00:31:04,674 --> 00:31:07,586
Towards the underpass, I saw two men...

457
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:10,524
...standing behind a picket fence...

458
00:31:11,095 --> 00:31:15,213
...looking up towards Main and Houston,
as the caravan came down.

459
00:31:17,516 --> 00:31:19,427
One of them was middle-aged...

460
00:31:19,643 --> 00:31:20,871
...heavyset.

461
00:31:21,685 --> 00:31:23,403
The other man was younger.

462
00:31:24,271 --> 00:31:27,263
Two other men were on the east end
of the parking lot.

463
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,442
They both had uniforms.

464
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,061
At the time of the shooting...

465
00:31:32,735 --> 00:31:35,329
...there seemed to be some commotion.

466
00:31:37,446 --> 00:31:39,721
I'm just unable to describe...

467
00:31:41,408 --> 00:31:44,241
...a flash of light or smoke or something...

468
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:48,402
...which caused me to feel that something
out of the ordinary...

469
00:31:48,621 --> 00:31:50,532
...had occurred on the embankment.

470
00:31:50,914 --> 00:31:51,903
Goddamn.

471
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,340
No!

472
00:32:15,681 --> 00:32:17,990
- You all right?
- Honey, it's incredible.

473
00:32:19,184 --> 00:32:20,014
What?

474
00:32:20,976 --> 00:32:22,295
The whole thing.

475
00:32:23,186 --> 00:32:25,142
A Lt. Colonel testifies that...

476
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:29,074
...Oswald had a Russian language exam
as part of his Marine training...

477
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:32,546
...only a few months before he defects
to the Soviet Union.

478
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:34,580
A Russian exam.

479
00:32:35,027 --> 00:32:39,464
It's 4:30 in the morning!
I have five kids who'll wake up in an hour.

480
00:32:39,739 --> 00:32:44,096
In all my years in the military, I never knew
a single man who had a Russian test.

481
00:32:45,368 --> 00:32:47,279
Oswald was a radar operator.

482
00:32:47,786 --> 00:32:51,017
He'd have about as much use for Russian
as a cat has for pajamas.

483
00:32:51,247 --> 00:32:53,761
These books have gotten to your mind!

484
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,418
- Stop reading.
- He makes it sound like nothing.

485
00:32:57,835 --> 00:32:59,712
Oswald did badly on his test.

486
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:03,242
He got only two more Russian words right
than wrong.

487
00:33:03,797 --> 00:33:07,187
That's like me saying,
Touchdown is not very intelligent...

488
00:33:07,424 --> 00:33:10,780
...because I beat him three games
out of five when we played chess.

489
00:33:11,594 --> 00:33:15,269
Are you going to stay up all night,
every night? For what?

490
00:33:16,014 --> 00:33:19,165
To be the only man who's read
all 26 volumes of the Warren Report?

491
00:33:19,391 --> 00:33:21,427
Do I have to spell it out for you?

492
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:24,963
Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.

493
00:33:26,229 --> 00:33:29,539
He was in military intelligence,
that's why he was trained in Russian.

494
00:33:29,773 --> 00:33:31,843
It was no accident he was in Russia.

495
00:33:32,024 --> 00:33:35,494
- Go back to sleep.
- I've been sleeping for three years!

496
00:33:53,706 --> 00:33:56,266
'Morning boys. Ready for a walking tour?

497
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,890
7:30 Sunday morning?
Not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing.

498
00:34:00,502 --> 00:34:02,538
Old stains, but just as telling.

499
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:12,264
531 Lafayette Street.

500
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:15,244
Remember whose office this was in '63?

501
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:18,474
Sure. Guy Banister.

502
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,973
Ex-FBI man. Died a couple of years ago.

503
00:34:24,643 --> 00:34:28,716
He headed the Chicago office. When he
retired he became a private eye here.

504
00:34:29,397 --> 00:34:32,787
I used to have lunch with him.
John Birch Society, Minutemen.

505
00:34:33,483 --> 00:34:35,439
To the right of Attila the Hun.

506
00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:39,246
Recruited students to infiltrate
radical organizations on campus.

507
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:43,244
Headed the Anti-Communist League
of the Caribbean.

508
00:34:43,865 --> 00:34:45,537
All out of this office.

509
00:34:48,994 --> 00:34:50,871
I want to show you something.

510
00:34:59,251 --> 00:35:00,730
Take a look here.

511
00:35:01,377 --> 00:35:02,969
544 Camp Street.

512
00:35:04,212 --> 00:35:06,009
531 Lafayette Street.

513
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:08,348
Same building, right?

514
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:12,712
Different addresses, different entrances,
both going to the same place...

515
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:15,016
...to the office upstairs.

516
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:17,192
Guess who used it?

517
00:35:19,722 --> 00:35:21,121
Lee Harvey Oswald.

518
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:24,314
How do we know that?

519
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,562
This address was stamped on...

520
00:35:26,727 --> 00:35:31,198
...pro-Castro leaflets he handed out
in the summer of '63 on Canal Street.

521
00:35:31,857 --> 00:35:34,769
The same leaflets they found
in his garage in Dallas.

522
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:41,603
After the arrest, 544 Camp St.
Never appeared on the pamphlets again.

523
00:35:43,238 --> 00:35:46,196
He was arrested for fighting
with anti-Castro Cubans.

524
00:35:47,617 --> 00:35:49,414
But he'd contacted them already...

525
00:35:49,576 --> 00:35:53,012
...as an ex-Marine trying
to join their anti-Castro crusade.

526
00:35:53,996 --> 00:35:57,989
When they heard he was now pro-Castro,
they paid him a visit.

527
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:01,472
What's this Fidel shit? You lied to me!

528
00:36:02,878 --> 00:36:04,391
Liar! Son of a bitch!

529
00:36:05,003 --> 00:36:07,437
Do not take this Communist propaganda!

530
00:36:08,548 --> 00:36:10,186
If you want to hit me, hit me.

531
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:11,774
You pinko shit!

532
00:36:12,133 --> 00:36:13,532
Go back to Moscow!

533
00:36:14,093 --> 00:36:15,651
There was no real fight.

534
00:36:15,803 --> 00:36:19,557
The arresting Lieutenant later said
he felt it was a staged incident.

535
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:22,573
In jail, Oswald has a private session...

536
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:25,360
...with Special Agent John Quigley
of the FBI.

537
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,993
Oswald is released.

538
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,984
And Quigley destroys his notes
from the interview.

539
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,908
The arrest gets Oswald a lot of publicity.

540
00:36:34,691 --> 00:36:36,841
And he appears on a local TV debate.

541
00:36:37,651 --> 00:36:39,369
You are a Communist, are you not?

542
00:36:39,527 --> 00:36:44,317
No, Mr. Bringuier. I am not a Communist.
I'm a Marxist-Leninist.

543
00:36:44,614 --> 00:36:48,607
Communist, Marxist-Leninist,
what's the difference?

544
00:36:49,784 --> 00:36:54,539
What if I told you Oswald was trained
in the Russian language in the Marines?

545
00:36:55,163 --> 00:36:57,393
I'd say he got intelligence training.

546
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,573
You were a Marine. Who'd run it?

547
00:36:59,749 --> 00:37:01,626
Office of Naval Intelligence.

548
00:37:02,251 --> 00:37:03,923
Look across the street.

549
00:37:04,878 --> 00:37:05,993
Post Office.

550
00:37:06,587 --> 00:37:10,102
Upstairs, in 1963,
that was the Office of Naval Intelligence.

551
00:37:11,215 --> 00:37:14,332
By coincidence, Banister,
before he was FBI, was ONI.

552
00:37:15,051 --> 00:37:16,564
What's their saying?

553
00:37:16,803 --> 00:37:18,521
"Once ONI, always ONI."

554
00:37:18,929 --> 00:37:21,284
He likes working near his old pals.

555
00:37:24,933 --> 00:37:26,525
We are standing in the heart...

556
00:37:26,684 --> 00:37:30,154
...of the US government's intelligence
community in New Orleans.

557
00:37:30,645 --> 00:37:31,839
That's the FBI.

558
00:37:32,188 --> 00:37:33,223
That's the CIA.

559
00:37:33,689 --> 00:37:35,281
That's the Secret Service.

560
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,509
That's the ONI.

561
00:37:36,649 --> 00:37:38,958
Isn't this a strange place...

562
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:41,619
...for a Communist
to spend his spare time?

563
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,668
What are you driving at?

564
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,990
We're going back into the case.

565
00:37:52,994 --> 00:37:54,507
The murder of the President.

566
00:37:54,662 --> 00:37:56,892
Lord, wake me. I must be dreaming.

567
00:37:57,414 --> 00:37:59,450
You're awake. I'm deadly serious.

568
00:37:59,999 --> 00:38:03,230
Let's track down your anonymous source
from three years ago.

569
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:06,531
How'd you find out David Ferrie drove
to Texas that day?

570
00:38:06,837 --> 00:38:10,273
I can't remember last night,
let alone three years ago, Boss.

571
00:38:15,175 --> 00:38:17,131
You're not being cross-examined.

572
00:38:17,302 --> 00:38:21,454
I need clarification about the night
Guy Banister beat you over the head.

573
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,250
Don't tell me you don't remember.

574
00:38:24,557 --> 00:38:29,073
You called our office from your hospital
bed. You were hopping mad about it.

575
00:38:30,436 --> 00:38:31,835
Here's my problem.

576
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:35,634
You told me you and Guy were
good friends for a long time.

577
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:38,491
- Over ten years.
- And he never hit you before?

578
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:40,045
Never touched me.

579
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,805
Yet, on November 22, 1963...

580
00:38:42,986 --> 00:38:45,261
...the day of the President's murder...

581
00:38:45,446 --> 00:38:47,277
...the police report says...

582
00:38:48,115 --> 00:38:50,993
...he pistol-whipped you
with a.357 Magnum.

583
00:38:51,909 --> 00:38:54,946
It also says you argued
about the phone bill. Look!

584
00:38:56,453 --> 00:39:00,446
Is an argument over a phone bill
a believable explanation to you?

585
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:05,142
There's more to it.

586
00:39:06,753 --> 00:39:07,947
How much more?

587
00:39:08,712 --> 00:39:10,065
I shouldn't talk about it.

588
00:39:10,213 --> 00:39:13,330
I'd ask Guy. We were friendly.
Heart attack?

589
00:39:14,174 --> 00:39:15,926
You buy what you read in the papers.

590
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:19,209
- You have other information?
- I didn't say that!

591
00:39:19,428 --> 00:39:24,548
All I know is he died suddenly.
Just before the Warren Report came out.

592
00:39:26,724 --> 00:39:28,442
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?

593
00:39:36,439 --> 00:39:38,031
You were the only one here!

594
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,828
The only one here!

595
00:39:44,695 --> 00:39:46,765
You didn't see a goddamn thing!

596
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:51,323
Hell, Guy's dead, so it don't matter
no more. It was all about those...

597
00:39:52,575 --> 00:39:55,726
...people that was hanging
around the office that summer.

598
00:39:57,078 --> 00:39:59,034
I was never part of the operation.

599
00:39:59,205 --> 00:40:02,914
I just handled their private-eye work
as it came in for Guy.

600
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,809
Not much did, but that's why I was there.

601
00:40:07,877 --> 00:40:09,276
It was a nuthouse.

602
00:40:10,505 --> 00:40:14,578
Cubans coming, going. And Christ,
they all looked the same to me.

603
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,894
You going to play with this rifle or pack it?

604
00:40:19,218 --> 00:40:20,571
Dave Ferrie.

605
00:40:20,803 --> 00:40:24,000
- You know about him?
- We know Dave. Was he there?

606
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:26,774
He practically lived there.

607
00:40:28,766 --> 00:40:30,518
The whole thing was...

608
00:40:31,351 --> 00:40:33,262
...all cloak-and-dagger stuff.

609
00:40:33,478 --> 00:40:35,628
They called it "Operation Mongoose."

610
00:40:37,523 --> 00:40:41,516
The idea was to train these Cuban exiles
for another invasion of Cuba.

611
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:45,078
Banister's office was part
of the supply line...

612
00:40:45,278 --> 00:40:47,712
...from Dallas through New Orleans
to Miami.

613
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:49,815
We stockpiled arms, explosives.

614
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,478
In view of the intelligence community
in Lafayette Square?

615
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:57,899
Yes. Everybody knew everybody.
They were all part of the network.

616
00:40:58,412 --> 00:41:00,164
All worked for the CIA.

617
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,915
Pilots and black operators
and civilians and the military.

618
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:08,658
Everybody was running guns then.

619
00:41:09,669 --> 00:41:12,627
Ft. Jefferson, Bayou Bluff,
Morgan City, you name it.

620
00:41:13,047 --> 00:41:15,925
McAllen, Texas? Big gun-run operation.

621
00:41:20,385 --> 00:41:22,694
Where does Banister fit in?

622
00:41:22,929 --> 00:41:25,602
He was running his camp
north of Lake Pontchartrain.

623
00:41:25,805 --> 00:41:27,557
Ferrie did a lot of the training.

624
00:41:27,723 --> 00:41:32,114
They had a shooting range
and tropical territory, like in Cuba.

625
00:41:32,935 --> 00:41:35,165
Some Americans were trained there too.

626
00:41:35,353 --> 00:41:37,184
Nazi types. Mercenaries.

627
00:41:38,355 --> 00:41:41,313
That Ferrie, though,
Jesus, he was the craziest.

628
00:41:42,858 --> 00:41:47,773
Late summer the party was over.
Kennedy didn't want another Bay of Pigs.

629
00:41:49,446 --> 00:41:51,596
He told the FBI, "Shut up the camp.

630
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:54,424
"Confiscate the napalm, C-4 and all."

631
00:41:55,118 --> 00:41:58,155
The G-men were just going
through the motions.

632
00:41:59,203 --> 00:42:02,115
Their hearts were still
with their old FBI buddy Banister.

633
00:42:04,874 --> 00:42:06,068
Oswald?

634
00:42:10,836 --> 00:42:12,474
He was there too.

635
00:42:13,713 --> 00:42:15,749
Sometimes meeting with Banister.

636
00:42:19,134 --> 00:42:20,567
With the door shut.

637
00:42:23,261 --> 00:42:27,049
Shootin' the bull with Ferrie, whatever.
But he was there, all right.

638
00:42:27,389 --> 00:42:29,061
Anything more specific, Jack?

639
00:42:29,682 --> 00:42:30,910
It's important.

640
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:37,192
One time, the secretary got upset.

641
00:42:37,396 --> 00:42:40,627
I can't believe it, Mr. Banister,
Oswald is down on Canal Street...

642
00:42:40,857 --> 00:42:43,849
...handing out Communist leaflets
supporting Castro.

643
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,288
It's okay, Delphine, he's with us.

644
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:55,632
Was anyone else involved at...

645
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:57,262
...Banister's level?

646
00:42:58,243 --> 00:42:59,995
One guy. I don't know who.

647
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,758
Big. White hair.

648
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,986
I saw him in the office once.
He looked out of place.

649
00:43:07,541 --> 00:43:09,372
You know, a society guy.

650
00:43:10,085 --> 00:43:12,838
Can't remember his name,
but Oswald was with him.

651
00:43:14,755 --> 00:43:18,430
He had something to do with money,
because Banister never kissed ass...

652
00:43:18,674 --> 00:43:20,471
...but he kissed his.

653
00:43:28,056 --> 00:43:29,205
Clay something.

654
00:43:29,348 --> 00:43:31,179
That was his name. Clay...

655
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:32,623
- Bertrand?
- Yeah.

656
00:43:32,767 --> 00:43:34,962
- Clay Bertrand?
- I don't know.

657
00:43:35,644 --> 00:43:37,475
- Maybe not.
- No, that's right.

658
00:43:37,646 --> 00:43:38,681
I must go.

659
00:43:39,313 --> 00:43:42,225
He was in the Warren Report.
He got Oswald a lawyer.

660
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:44,544
Was Kennedy discussed?

661
00:43:44,692 --> 00:43:45,886
I don't know.

662
00:43:46,776 --> 00:43:48,448
- The assassination?
- No.

663
00:43:48,653 --> 00:43:50,928
- Not with me. I've got to go.
- Hold on.

664
00:43:51,238 --> 00:43:53,672
- That's all I'll say.
- What's the problem?

665
00:43:58,034 --> 00:44:00,025
Do I have to spell it out for you?

666
00:44:00,202 --> 00:44:02,670
Nobody knows what
we're talking about here.

667
00:44:04,455 --> 00:44:05,968
You are so naive.

668
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:20,464
- When'd you do business with Bertrand?
- Pipe the bimbo in red.

669
00:44:22,592 --> 00:44:25,425
- Lawdy.
- She's not as cute as you.

670
00:44:26,845 --> 00:44:30,724
- You should try a legitimate business.
- Why are you dancing on my head?

671
00:44:31,015 --> 00:44:34,166
- We've been friends since law school.
- Because you're conning me.

672
00:44:34,392 --> 00:44:36,701
- I read your testimony.
- Grain of salt.

673
00:44:37,103 --> 00:44:40,732
You said Clay Bertrand called you
the day after the assassination...

674
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,097
...and asked you to be Oswald's lawyer.
- Right.

675
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,072
That's pretty important.

676
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:52,047
You told the FBI he's 6' 2".
Then you tell the Commission he's 5' 8".

677
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:54,964
How the hell does a man shrink like that?

678
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:59,802
They put the heat on me, like you. I gave
them whatever popped in my cabeza.

679
00:45:00,535 --> 00:45:02,491
Truth is, I never met the dude.

680
00:45:03,913 --> 00:45:06,302
- One likes friends that have friends.
- Indeed.

681
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:09,535
I don't know what that cat looks like
or where he's at.

682
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:12,430
All I know is sometimes
he sends me some cases.

683
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:16,347
One day he calls, talks to me
about repping Oswald in Dallas.

684
00:45:16,754 --> 00:45:19,109
- You ever speak to Oswald in Dallas?
- No.

685
00:45:19,298 --> 00:45:22,768
I told that Bertrand cat right off
this ain't my scene.

686
00:45:23,092 --> 00:45:27,449
- I'm a hack. He needs a hot dog.
- Then how did you get in the Commission?

687
00:45:28,346 --> 00:45:30,382
Like I told the Washington boys...

688
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:34,518
...Bertrand asked me that summer to help
the kid upgrade his Marine discharge.

689
00:45:34,767 --> 00:45:38,840
Mr. Bertrand said
he would take care of any of...

690
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:39,819
Fine.

691
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:43,816
- To whom am I speaking?
- Clay Bertrand. I'll pay what they owe.

692
00:45:44,148 --> 00:45:48,426
There was no conspiracy. If there was,
why didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute?

693
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:50,578
He was his brother.

694
00:45:51,403 --> 00:45:53,871
How'd so many people keep such a secret?

695
00:45:54,738 --> 00:45:58,333
- It was Oswald. He hated...
- We're having a communication problem.

696
00:45:58,575 --> 00:46:03,126
I know you know who Clay Bertrand is.
Stop eating that crabmeat and listen.

697
00:46:03,536 --> 00:46:07,893
I'm aware of our friendship,
but I'll call you before the grand jury.

698
00:46:08,748 --> 00:46:12,502
You lie to them as you lied to me,
I'll charge you with perjury.

699
00:46:12,918 --> 00:46:15,386
I took nine judges on here in New Orleans.

700
00:46:15,586 --> 00:46:18,384
I beat them all.
Am I communicating with you?

701
00:46:20,548 --> 00:46:21,981
Off the record?

702
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:26,325
In that case, let me sum it up for you.

703
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:33,490
If I answer that question you keep asking...

704
00:46:34,516 --> 00:46:37,269
...if I give you the name
of the big enchilada...

705
00:46:38,602 --> 00:46:40,797
...then it's bon voyage, Deano.

706
00:46:41,271 --> 00:46:43,341
Like a bullet in my head, you dig?

707
00:46:43,647 --> 00:46:47,276
You're a mouse fighting a gorilla.
JFK's dead as that crabmeat.

708
00:46:47,942 --> 00:46:50,502
The government's still breathing.

709
00:46:51,069 --> 00:46:54,106
Either you give the grand jury
Clay Bertrand's real identity...

710
00:46:54,321 --> 00:46:56,994
...or your fat behind's
going to the slammer.

711
00:46:57,448 --> 00:47:00,645
You're as crazy as your mama.
It's in the genes.

712
00:47:01,284 --> 00:47:03,514
Do you know what you're getting into?

713
00:47:04,202 --> 00:47:08,320
The government will jump all over
your head and go cock-a-doodle-doo.

714
00:47:09,206 --> 00:47:10,719
Good day to you, sir.

715
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:19,122
District Attorney Garrison
to see Prisoner 5388.

716
00:47:19,713 --> 00:47:21,305
Ward block 237B.

717
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,256
We don't need gates with that swamp.

718
00:47:38,476 --> 00:47:41,274
Many of them gone in there,
none of them came out.

719
00:47:55,863 --> 00:47:58,935
You got visitors here.
Don't give them trouble.

720
00:47:59,782 --> 00:48:02,535
- How you doing, Mr. Broussard?
- Let's go, Willie.

721
00:48:14,751 --> 00:48:17,026
Thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.

722
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:19,466
I got nothing but time.

723
00:48:20,338 --> 00:48:22,533
Minutes, hours, days. Years of it.

724
00:48:23,089 --> 00:48:27,241
Time stands still here,
like a snake sunning itself.

725
00:48:27,969 --> 00:48:29,163
Clay Bertrand?

726
00:48:32,972 --> 00:48:35,088
I met him sometime in...

727
00:48:35,557 --> 00:48:38,276
...June of '62. The Masquerade Bar.

728
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:41,603
Dave Ferrie took me there
expressly to meet him.

729
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:43,589
Sexual purposes?

730
00:48:45,105 --> 00:48:46,299
Did he pay you?

731
00:48:46,689 --> 00:48:50,045
$20 each time. Ain't no secret.
That's what I'm in here for.

732
00:48:50,275 --> 00:48:51,788
Anything unusual about him...

733
00:48:51,943 --> 00:48:54,173
...you'd be able to describe in court?

734
00:48:54,361 --> 00:48:57,512
He had something wrong with his leg,
a limp.

735
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,578
Don't get me wrong.
He's not one of those limp wrists.

736
00:49:00,782 --> 00:49:03,694
He's a butch John. Meet him on the street,
you'd never snap.

737
00:49:03,951 --> 00:49:08,388
You could play poker with him,
go fishing, you'd never snap.

738
00:49:08,996 --> 00:49:11,351
One night we were at David Ferrie's...

739
00:49:11,706 --> 00:49:14,425
...sometime late in the summer of '63.

740
00:49:16,251 --> 00:49:18,845
There was about nine to ten people there.

741
00:49:19,086 --> 00:49:23,364
Cuban. Friends who'd done stuff
in the bush with him. Place was a mess.

742
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,637
Dave's mind was a mess.
He had caged mice...

743
00:49:27,216 --> 00:49:29,605
...'cause he's working on a cancer cure.

744
00:49:31,011 --> 00:49:33,889
Dave's smart, though.
Speaks five languages.

745
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:38,787
Knows philosophy, medicine,
military history, politics.

746
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:43,389
He wanted to be a priest.
They defrocked him 'cause he was queer.

747
00:49:43,853 --> 00:49:46,003
That's where you first met Oswald?

748
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:49,119
Strange guy. Dave introduced him as...

749
00:49:49,315 --> 00:49:50,543
Leon Oswald.

750
00:49:50,941 --> 00:49:52,215
How you doing?

751
00:49:53,234 --> 00:49:55,190
What the fuck is he doing here?

752
00:49:55,361 --> 00:49:56,999
Fuck you, motherfucker.

753
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:02,037
Leon's in a bad mood. Don't get excited.

754
00:50:02,782 --> 00:50:05,342
You said Leon was actually
Lee Harvey Oswald?

755
00:50:05,577 --> 00:50:08,171
Yeah. I have no reason to lie to you.

756
00:50:08,703 --> 00:50:10,182
I'm already in jail.

757
00:50:10,788 --> 00:50:11,425
Go on.

758
00:50:11,872 --> 00:50:15,182
Finally they left
and I was alone with Dave...

759
00:50:15,542 --> 00:50:16,975
...and this Leon...

760
00:50:17,167 --> 00:50:19,635
...two of the Cubans,
and this guy Bertrand.

761
00:50:21,003 --> 00:50:23,039
Dave pulled out some clippings.

762
00:50:23,213 --> 00:50:26,285
He'd been obsessed with Castro
and Kennedy for months.

763
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:31,228
Little ass-wipe closed down the camps!
Took our C-4!

764
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:35,389
Took 10,000 rounds!
3,000 pounds of gunpowder!

765
00:50:35,638 --> 00:50:36,957
All our weapons!

766
00:50:38,682 --> 00:50:41,321
You want to free Cuba?
Whack out the fucking beard!

767
00:50:41,518 --> 00:50:44,510
Kennedy won't let us.
Our hands are empty. How can we?

768
00:50:44,853 --> 00:50:47,686
Problem is getting to him.
Informers on every block.

769
00:50:47,896 --> 00:50:49,648
They got new stuff!

770
00:50:49,856 --> 00:50:54,327
I could show you dozens of poisons!
Put it in his food, he'd die in three days.

771
00:50:54,776 --> 00:50:55,811
No trace!

772
00:50:55,944 --> 00:50:59,778
Put something in his beard,
make it fall out. He'd look ridiculous...

773
00:51:01,156 --> 00:51:05,672
Fucking Kennedy is doing all kinds of deals
with that bastard Khrushchev.

774
00:51:06,451 --> 00:51:07,804
Licking his ass.

775
00:51:09,244 --> 00:51:13,795
An inspired act of God should happen here
and put a Texan in the White House!

776
00:51:15,832 --> 00:51:18,790
The Cubans left. Dave was drunk.

777
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:22,000
He started in on Kennedy again.

778
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:25,496
I will kill! In the White House!
Stab him in the heart!

779
00:51:26,256 --> 00:51:28,133
Somebody must get rid of him!

780
00:51:29,592 --> 00:51:31,787
You won't get that son of a bitch!

781
00:51:32,052 --> 00:51:35,328
It won't be long.
That fucker will get what he deserves.

782
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:38,830
It could be blamed on Castro,
the country will want to invade Cuba.

783
00:51:39,057 --> 00:51:41,332
We just need to get him in the open.

784
00:51:41,558 --> 00:51:44,789
Always some harebrained scheme.

785
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,183
Let's have some more champagne,
shall we?

786
00:51:51,398 --> 00:51:53,832
What about the Secret Service? The cops?

787
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,836
If it's planned right, no problem.
They got close to De Gaulle.

788
00:51:58,236 --> 00:52:00,147
Eisenhower always rode in open top.

789
00:52:00,321 --> 00:52:03,279
We need three mechanics
in three different locations.

790
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:06,174
An office building, a high-powered rifle.

791
00:52:06,658 --> 00:52:10,173
Triangulation of crossfire, that's the key.
That's the key.

792
00:52:10,953 --> 00:52:13,831
A diversionary shot
gets the Secret Service looking one way.

793
00:52:14,038 --> 00:52:15,710
Boom! Get the kill shot.

794
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:18,782
One man has to be sacrificed.

795
00:52:20,043 --> 00:52:22,193
In the commotion, the job gets done.

796
00:52:22,419 --> 00:52:24,296
The others leave the country.

797
00:52:24,921 --> 00:52:29,199
Let's drop this subject.
It's one thing to banter with these kids...

798
00:52:29,508 --> 00:52:33,183
...but this sort of thing could be
so easily misunderstood.

799
00:52:34,469 --> 00:52:37,586
I didn't think much about it then.
It's just bullshit.

800
00:52:37,804 --> 00:52:40,477
People like to act more important
than they are.

801
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:42,680
Especially in the homosexual underworld.

802
00:52:44,351 --> 00:52:45,989
But when they got him...

803
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:47,952
...I got scared.

804
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:49,623
Real scared.

805
00:52:50,189 --> 00:52:51,508
That's when I got popped.

806
00:52:51,647 --> 00:52:54,764
The things you said will be attacked
by many people.

807
00:52:55,317 --> 00:52:59,754
Bring them on. Bring their college degrees
in here, I got nothing to hide.

808
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:01,981
No one can buy me.

809
00:53:02,155 --> 00:53:05,465
- I don't even need this parole.
- What parole?

810
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:10,461
You liberal, you don't know shit
'cause you never been fucked in the ass.

811
00:53:10,952 --> 00:53:14,661
This ain't about justice!
No, this is about order!

812
00:53:15,205 --> 00:53:17,435
Who rules? Fascism is coming back.

813
00:53:17,665 --> 00:53:21,453
Nobody wants to buy you.
No one's promising you parole.

814
00:53:23,545 --> 00:53:27,857
What I need to know
is why are you telling us this.

815
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:30,701
'Cause that motherfucker Kennedy...

816
00:53:30,883 --> 00:53:33,602
...stole that motherfucking election,
that's why.

817
00:53:33,885 --> 00:53:37,514
Nixon was going to be a great President
until Kennedy wrecked this country.

818
00:53:37,763 --> 00:53:41,802
Niggers wanting rights!
Why do you think we have all this crime.

819
00:53:42,308 --> 00:53:44,868
He promised those motherfuckers
too much!

820
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:48,017
Revolution's coming, bullshit!
Fascism's coming back!

821
00:53:48,353 --> 00:53:52,904
The day that Communist son of a bitch
died was a great day!

822
00:53:53,189 --> 00:53:55,100
A great day for this country.

823
00:53:55,483 --> 00:53:58,919
I hate to think they blame it
on silly, fucking Oswald.

824
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,560
Didn't know shit, anyway.

825
00:54:01,904 --> 00:54:05,180
People got to know.
People got to know why he was killed.

826
00:54:06,074 --> 00:54:08,588
Because he was a Communist.

827
00:54:09,492 --> 00:54:13,770
You go ahead, put me on the stand,
I'll tell the same goddamned story!

828
00:54:14,204 --> 00:54:15,796
Don't matter to me!

829
00:54:17,414 --> 00:54:19,484
All right, Willie. Thanks.

830
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:22,024
We'll be in touch.

831
00:54:22,209 --> 00:54:23,403
All right.

832
00:54:28,797 --> 00:54:31,152
You know, you're not a bad-looking man.

833
00:54:31,882 --> 00:54:33,110
Not bad at all.

834
00:54:33,717 --> 00:54:36,675
I get out of here, I'll come see you.
We can have fun!

835
00:54:37,345 --> 00:54:39,540
Their testimony won't hold up in court.

836
00:54:39,722 --> 00:54:42,680
Their reputations are lower
than crocodile piss.

837
00:54:43,307 --> 00:54:44,786
That bothers you?

838
00:54:46,475 --> 00:54:50,514
If a woman's a prostitute,
must she also have bad eyesight?

839
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:54,941
Find Clay Bertrand.
Start by checking around the Quarter.

840
00:54:55,148 --> 00:54:57,901
The six of us,
with almost no budget and in secret...

841
00:54:58,108 --> 00:55:00,668
...will solve a case
the Warren Commission couldn't?

842
00:55:00,861 --> 00:55:04,570
- I didn't pick you for your legal skill.
- Thanks, Boss.

843
00:55:04,905 --> 00:55:08,693
You're a fighter.
I like a man who's not afraid of bad odds.

844
00:55:09,241 --> 00:55:11,880
Mr. Garrison, how are you?
Remember me?

845
00:55:12,285 --> 00:55:13,513
You vote for me?

846
00:55:13,661 --> 00:55:16,937
I did. We sang together
at the Royal Orleans, remember?

847
00:55:17,288 --> 00:55:18,437
We sang:

848
00:55:18,623 --> 00:55:21,535
"You're the cream in my coffee"

849
00:55:24,043 --> 00:55:25,920
Haven't seen you much lately.

850
00:55:26,128 --> 00:55:30,121
Been too busy. Elected men can't have
as much fun as they used to.

851
00:55:30,422 --> 00:55:33,619
It's always nice to see you.
Pleasure to serve you always.

852
00:55:35,634 --> 00:55:37,864
How are you? Nice to see you.

853
00:55:39,012 --> 00:55:40,525
Welcome back, Lou.

854
00:55:42,264 --> 00:55:45,574
- Think I could get a martini?
- They're waiting for you, sir.

855
00:55:47,059 --> 00:55:49,050
Keep that table open for us.

856
00:55:52,104 --> 00:55:53,856
Anything on the hoboes?

857
00:55:54,355 --> 00:55:57,506
Dallas Times Herald photographer
got great shots.

858
00:55:58,358 --> 00:55:59,871
Never published.

859
00:56:02,069 --> 00:56:04,537
Can't say that comes as a surprise.

860
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:09,959
They took them to the sheriff's
and let them go. No record of questioning.

861
00:56:11,033 --> 00:56:14,105
Do they look like the hoboes
you remember?

862
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,872
These two look young.

863
00:56:17,163 --> 00:56:21,236
Not a frayed collar or cuff,
fresh haircuts and shaves...

864
00:56:21,498 --> 00:56:25,013
...clean hands, new shoe leather.
- Who the hell are they then?

865
00:56:28,712 --> 00:56:29,827
Sit down.

866
00:56:32,423 --> 00:56:34,983
This could be it. Let's look for them.

867
00:56:35,842 --> 00:56:40,472
What about the railroad man, Lee Bowers,
who saw the men at the picket fence?

868
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:43,647
Graveyard. Dead. August this year.

869
00:56:44,306 --> 00:56:47,821
Single-car accident on an empty road
in Midlothian, Texas.

870
00:56:48,226 --> 00:56:51,263
The doctor said he was in a strange shock
when he died.

871
00:56:51,936 --> 00:56:53,847
We need to find more witnesses.

872
00:56:54,104 --> 00:56:56,413
There was Rose Cheramie, a whore.

873
00:56:56,773 --> 00:56:59,571
She said she was a dope runner
for Jack Ruby.

874
00:57:00,234 --> 00:57:03,544
And that Ruby knew Oswald for years.

875
00:57:04,444 --> 00:57:07,083
- Can we talk to her?
- She's dead too.

876
00:57:07,781 --> 00:57:09,055
Hit and run.

877
00:57:14,202 --> 00:57:16,477
Why don't we go to the horse's mouth?

878
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:21,630
Jack Ruby's been in a Dallas jail cell
for three years. Maybe he'll crack.

879
00:57:21,915 --> 00:57:25,908
Can't. If I go to him our investigation
will hit the front pages.

880
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:30,294
It'll blow up in our face.
Susie, what did you find on Oswald?

881
00:57:30,838 --> 00:57:33,557
Negative on his tax records. Classified.

882
00:57:34,215 --> 00:57:36,775
First time a DA can't get a tax record.

883
00:57:37,509 --> 00:57:42,060
I asked for the CIA files on Oswald
that were part of the Warren Report.

884
00:57:43,638 --> 00:57:47,711
About 1,200 documents.
Can't get one of them.

885
00:57:48,016 --> 00:57:51,326
All classified as secret on the grounds
of national security.

886
00:57:51,852 --> 00:57:55,925
Gave me his grammar school records.
It's a study of his pubic hairs.

887
00:57:56,688 --> 00:57:58,280
Lonely kid, no father.

888
00:57:58,815 --> 00:58:00,771
Joins the Marines at 17.

889
00:58:01,317 --> 00:58:03,956
Learns Russian. Acts overtly Marxist.

890
00:58:04,944 --> 00:58:08,254
But he's stationed
at a top-secret air base in Japan...

891
00:58:08,488 --> 00:58:11,286
...where U-2 spy flights
over Russia originate.

892
00:58:12,033 --> 00:58:13,512
He's discharged...

893
00:58:13,784 --> 00:58:17,174
...supposedly because his mother's sick.
Stays home three days.

894
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:22,087
Then, with a $1,500 ticket from
a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow.

895
00:58:22,706 --> 00:58:24,378
Mr. Oswald, do you understand...

896
00:58:24,541 --> 00:58:27,533
...the action you are about to take?
- Yes, I do, sir.

897
00:58:30,962 --> 00:58:33,157
I wish to renounce my citizenship...

898
00:58:33,964 --> 00:58:36,353
...and become a Soviet citizen.

899
00:58:37,383 --> 00:58:40,978
I'll give them all the information
I have on the Marines.

900
00:58:41,677 --> 00:58:44,635
He disappears for six weeks,
presumably with the KGB.

901
00:58:45,514 --> 00:58:48,074
He's taken to a radio factory in Minsk...

902
00:58:48,265 --> 00:58:51,462
...where he lives as high on the hog
as he ever has.

903
00:58:51,767 --> 00:58:55,362
He's given 5,000 rubles,
a roomy apartment with a balcony.

904
00:58:56,855 --> 00:58:58,732
Has affairs with local girls.

905
00:58:58,982 --> 00:59:00,893
Makes sense. He's a spokesman.

906
00:59:02,275 --> 00:59:05,745
But he never does any propaganda
for the Russians.

907
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:08,503
He meets Marina.

908
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:12,022
Her uncle is a colonel
in Soviet intelligence.

909
00:59:13,908 --> 00:59:16,103
She thinks he's Russian by his speech.

910
00:59:16,285 --> 00:59:19,118
Six weeks later they marry,
have a daughter.

911
00:59:19,578 --> 00:59:23,571
Only explanation for the royal treatment
is he gave them radar secrets.

912
00:59:23,915 --> 00:59:25,314
Or fake secrets.

913
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:27,494
Six months after he's in Russia...

914
00:59:27,668 --> 00:59:30,978
...Francis Gary Powers' U-2 spy flight
goes down...

915
00:59:31,378 --> 00:59:33,846
...in Russia. That plane was untouchable.

916
00:59:34,255 --> 00:59:35,813
Powers hinted that Oswald...

917
00:59:35,965 --> 00:59:38,843
...could've given the Russians
enough data to hit it.

918
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:43,407
As a result, the peace summit between
Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.

919
00:59:43,678 --> 00:59:47,717
Perhaps our military didn't want
the conference to happen?

920
00:59:49,182 --> 00:59:51,412
Maybe Oswald was part of that!

921
00:59:51,642 --> 00:59:55,954
- Stick to what you can prove in court.
- You want facts?

922
00:59:56,771 --> 01:00:00,207
Don't get sidetracked.
How'd he get back to the States?

923
01:00:01,316 --> 01:00:03,671
Does he have any problems
with Uncle Sam?

924
01:00:03,859 --> 01:00:07,454
No. The State Department issues him
a new passport in 48 hours...

925
01:00:07,694 --> 01:00:09,605
...and loans him travel money.

926
01:00:10,321 --> 01:00:15,156
He's never investigated or charged
for revealing classified information...

927
01:00:15,659 --> 01:00:18,253
...or, as far as we know,
debriefed by the CIA.

928
01:00:18,452 --> 01:00:22,331
Bastard should've been prosecuted
as a traitor when he got off the boat.

929
01:00:23,747 --> 01:00:25,578
Did Marina have problems getting out?

930
01:00:25,749 --> 01:00:29,901
None, though it's almost impossible
to get Russian sweethearts out.

931
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:35,393
This is a man who defected once already.
It's crazy. Ordinary people...

932
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:39,036
...get blacklisted
for having leftist affiliations.

933
01:00:39,258 --> 01:00:40,452
Doesn't add up.

934
01:00:40,592 --> 01:00:43,868
Next thing, he's living in Dallas-Fort Worth,
October '62...

935
01:00:44,386 --> 01:00:47,264
...working six months
at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall...

936
01:00:47,513 --> 01:00:50,823
...a photographic firm that makes maps
for the US Army.

937
01:00:52,225 --> 01:00:55,501
Oswald becomes chummy
with the Dallas White Russian community.

938
01:00:55,728 --> 01:00:57,400
All rabid anti-Communists.

939
01:00:58,021 --> 01:00:58,931
It's odd.

940
01:00:59,063 --> 01:01:04,262
His closest friend is an oilman,
named George DeMohrenschildt.

941
01:01:04,566 --> 01:01:09,799
He is 35 years older than Oswald,
who is only 23 and supposedly broke.

942
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:15,659
He is a part of the Dallas Petroleum Club,
speaks five languages...

943
01:01:15,949 --> 01:01:18,747
...and was a French Vichy intelligence
during the war...

944
01:01:18,951 --> 01:01:22,102
...also rumored to be a Nazi sympathizer.

945
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:28,183
DeMohrenschildt draws a picture
of Oswald as an intellectual...

946
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:32,489
...well read, speaks excellent Russian,
a man who adored JFK.

947
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:39,292
I think he's made some mistakes
regarding Cuba.

948
01:01:40,132 --> 01:01:44,171
I think he's doing a pretty good job.
If he succeeds, in my opinion...

949
01:01:44,427 --> 01:01:47,658
...I think he'd make a great President
and a handsome one, too.

950
01:01:48,055 --> 01:01:50,615
That's scenery, Susie.
Now, don't get sidetracked.

951
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:54,482
This is the same man that nailed Oswald
to the Warren Commission...

952
01:01:54,725 --> 01:01:57,637
...as a potentially violent man
and linked him to the rifle.

953
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:01,251
Well, in that sense
Castro is an experimenter.

954
01:02:03,398 --> 01:02:05,628
It could go any way with that country.

955
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:09,131
- It could go the way of the communism...
- What you got there?

956
01:02:10,528 --> 01:02:12,405
Do you have rifles in there?

957
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:19,120
Tell me what I'm shooting at,
rabbits or Fascists?

958
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:22,810
- I hunt.
- You hunt?

959
01:02:23,662 --> 01:02:26,381
We don't know he's CIA.
Let's circle him very probable.

960
01:02:26,581 --> 01:02:28,253
Call him Oswald's handler.

961
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:32,947
The Oswalds are introduced
to Janet and Bill Williams.

962
01:02:35,295 --> 01:02:39,652
It's through Janet Williams,
in October '63, that Lee gets the job...

963
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:43,241
...at the warehouse on Elm Street
at the Book Depository.

964
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:48,894
So he can now exercise his intellect,
stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.

965
01:02:50,889 --> 01:02:54,086
Marina fights with Lee about many things.

966
01:02:56,601 --> 01:02:58,831
His secrecy, their lack of money.

967
01:02:59,854 --> 01:03:02,732
She says that Lee is not sexually adequate.

968
01:03:05,607 --> 01:03:07,677
Lee hits her on several occasions.

969
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:10,217
At the age of 24...

970
01:03:10,361 --> 01:03:13,637
...he rents a room in Dallas
under the alias of O.H. Lee.

971
01:03:14,155 --> 01:03:16,988
Do you want to watch TV?
Are you all right?

972
01:03:18,116 --> 01:03:19,788
No, thank you. I'm fine.

973
01:03:20,993 --> 01:03:24,702
All I know about the Williams is
their tax returns are classified.

974
01:03:25,037 --> 01:03:28,393
Bill Williams has links to the CIA
through his family...

975
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:31,350
...and does classified work
for Bell Helicopter.

976
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:35,899
Bill's convenient separation from Janet
allows Marina to move into her house...

977
01:03:36,295 --> 01:03:39,093
...where she suddenly becomes
Marina's best friend.

978
01:03:39,297 --> 01:03:42,175
There Marina and Lee
have a second daughter.

979
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:46,064
I have to go away. Just for a short while.

980
01:03:47,178 --> 01:03:49,089
What's wrong with this family?

981
01:03:49,429 --> 01:03:50,623
I love Lee...

982
01:03:51,055 --> 01:03:53,091
...and I sorry him.

983
01:03:53,765 --> 01:03:54,914
Sorry for him?

984
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:56,657
Yes.

985
01:03:56,768 --> 01:03:59,601
When he's arrested,
Marina buries him with the public.

986
01:03:59,811 --> 01:04:02,962
She describes him as a psychotic
and violent man.

987
01:04:03,605 --> 01:04:05,163
I have too much facts...

988
01:04:05,315 --> 01:04:09,103
...and facts tell me that Lee shot Kennedy.

989
01:04:09,651 --> 01:04:12,848
After being locked away
by the feds for two months...

990
01:04:13,111 --> 01:04:15,147
...and afraid she'd be deported...

991
01:04:15,571 --> 01:04:18,563
...she was probably suffering
from nervous exhaustion.

992
01:04:19,116 --> 01:04:21,027
They taught her how to answer.

993
01:04:21,242 --> 01:04:24,120
When they think she's ready,
they buy her dresses...

994
01:04:24,328 --> 01:04:26,683
...polish her appearance and wheel her out.

995
01:04:26,871 --> 01:04:30,341
- I'd like to thank the Warren Commission.
- Oswald was no angel.

996
01:04:31,874 --> 01:04:33,193
But who was he?

997
01:04:33,542 --> 01:04:35,772
I'm lost. What are we saying?

998
01:04:37,003 --> 01:04:40,439
That when Oswald went to Russia,
he was not a real defector.

999
01:04:41,506 --> 01:04:45,977
He was an intelligence agent for our
government and remained one till he died.

1000
01:04:47,427 --> 01:04:49,816
So, because Oswald pulled the trigger...

1001
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:53,345
...the intelligence community
murdered the President?

1002
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:56,995
I'll go you one better. Maybe Oswald...

1003
01:04:57,183 --> 01:04:58,901
...didn't pull the trigger.

1004
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:02,575
Nitrate tests indicate he hadn't fired
a rifle on November 22.

1005
01:05:02,812 --> 01:05:06,327
And they didn't bother to see
if the rifle'd been fired that day.

1006
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:10,341
- His palm print was on it.
- It went to the FBI.

1007
01:05:11,151 --> 01:05:13,142
FBI didn't find a goddamn thing.

1008
01:05:13,611 --> 01:05:18,048
It comes back a week later and a Dallas
policeman suddenly finds a palm print?

1009
01:05:18,906 --> 01:05:22,785
It could've been taken at the morgue.
There's no chain of evidence.

1010
01:05:23,035 --> 01:05:27,313
I can't figure out why he orders
a traceable weapon...

1011
01:05:27,579 --> 01:05:30,889
...to a P.O. Box, when he can go
into any store in Texas...

1012
01:05:31,748 --> 01:05:35,058
...give a phony name and walk out
with an untraceable rifle.

1013
01:05:35,376 --> 01:05:36,650
To frame him, obviously!

1014
01:05:36,794 --> 01:05:38,910
A lot of smoke, but some fire.

1015
01:05:39,171 --> 01:05:41,082
We're talking about our government!

1016
01:05:41,255 --> 01:05:43,405
We're talking about a crime.

1017
01:05:44,257 --> 01:05:47,294
You must think on a different level,
like the CIA does.

1018
01:05:48,051 --> 01:05:50,121
We're through the looking glass.

1019
01:05:51,221 --> 01:05:52,449
White is black.

1020
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:54,863
And black is white.

1021
01:05:55,974 --> 01:05:58,488
Maybe Oswald is just what he said he was.

1022
01:05:59,434 --> 01:06:00,469
A patsy.

1023
01:06:06,522 --> 01:06:08,558
Unbelievable. You were here?

1024
01:06:08,774 --> 01:06:10,924
Yes, this is where I was sitting.

1025
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:14,843
Shots came from near the wooden fence
over there...

1026
01:06:16,404 --> 01:06:17,917
...near the overpass.

1027
01:06:18,322 --> 01:06:21,951
I saw a man run from the fence
toward those railroad cars.

1028
01:06:22,742 --> 01:06:24,812
I made it clear to the Warren people.

1029
01:06:24,993 --> 01:06:27,905
One of the shots came
from behind that picket fence.

1030
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:32,613
I heard the report and saw smoke,
six or eight feet above the ground.

1031
01:06:33,082 --> 01:06:34,834
Out from under those trees.

1032
01:06:35,083 --> 01:06:38,280
All four of us railroad men...

1033
01:06:38,503 --> 01:06:40,141
...seen the same thing.

1034
01:06:40,837 --> 01:06:42,793
The smoke came from behind the hedge.

1035
01:06:42,963 --> 01:06:47,002
I was standing next to Mary Moorman,
who took the photo when he was killed.

1036
01:06:49,968 --> 01:06:52,243
I stepped down to the curb and yelled:

1037
01:06:52,637 --> 01:06:54,946
"Mr. President, look over here!"

1038
01:06:57,098 --> 01:06:58,577
Then shots rang out.

1039
01:07:00,768 --> 01:07:05,637
Mary dropped to the ground, yelling,
"They're shooting! Get down!"

1040
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:08,895
I just stood there watching.

1041
01:07:09,816 --> 01:07:11,454
The driver had stopped.

1042
01:07:12,442 --> 01:07:14,273
I don't know what was wrong with him.

1043
01:07:16,987 --> 01:07:18,898
Out of the corner of my eye...

1044
01:07:19,822 --> 01:07:21,813
...I saw a flash of light in the bushes.

1045
01:07:22,616 --> 01:07:24,095
And that last shot...

1046
01:07:25,451 --> 01:07:26,964
...just ripped his head off.

1047
01:07:28,369 --> 01:07:32,157
I looked up and saw smoke coming
from over there, on the knoll.

1048
01:07:32,456 --> 01:07:34,731
We came around to look for tracks.

1049
01:07:35,499 --> 01:07:38,377
It rained that morning
and we found a bunch.

1050
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:40,359
Cigarette butts.

1051
01:07:40,503 --> 01:07:42,812
Someone had stood about... here.

1052
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:50,733
That's a good spot.

1053
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:52,999
For the head shot.

1054
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:56,727
Everything was just frozen.

1055
01:07:57,765 --> 01:08:01,724
Like people weren't breathing.
Like you were looking at a picture.

1056
01:08:04,978 --> 01:08:06,411
Except for one man.

1057
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:11,632
I saw this one man running
from the corner of the Book Depository...

1058
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,253
...to the parking lot.

1059
01:08:13,525 --> 01:08:15,277
It was about 11:00 a.m.

1060
01:08:15,777 --> 01:08:19,247
I was driving on Elm Street
toward the underpass in a rented car.

1061
01:08:19,988 --> 01:08:21,467
A light-blue Valiant.

1062
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:25,437
I'll never forget that day.
There was a lot of traffic...

1063
01:08:25,659 --> 01:08:28,378
...and I stopped
alongside a green pickup truck.

1064
01:08:28,911 --> 01:08:32,824
It was very noticeable
because it had one wheel up on the curb.

1065
01:08:33,414 --> 01:08:35,166
When I saw the gun, I thought...

1066
01:08:37,626 --> 01:08:39,856
..."The Secret Service is not very secret."

1067
01:08:40,044 --> 01:08:42,717
The next morning, I went to the FBI office.

1068
01:08:42,921 --> 01:08:44,957
They showed me some pictures.

1069
01:08:45,256 --> 01:08:48,931
And I picked out three pictures
that looked like the truck's driver.

1070
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:51,366
That's the man.

1071
01:08:51,634 --> 01:08:54,023
You mean you identified Jack Ruby
on Saturday?

1072
01:08:54,387 --> 01:08:55,297
That's right.

1073
01:08:55,429 --> 01:08:57,021
The day before he shot Oswald?

1074
01:08:57,347 --> 01:09:00,623
That's right. When I saw him on TV,
I was shocked.

1075
01:09:01,057 --> 01:09:04,288
I said to my family,
"That's the man I saw in the truck."

1076
01:09:05,936 --> 01:09:08,575
You weren't so sure in your statement
to the Commission.

1077
01:09:09,189 --> 01:09:12,067
What about these others?
You said one might be him?

1078
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:16,395
They look a bit like him,
but I'm sure this is the man.

1079
01:09:16,777 --> 01:09:19,166
It was him I chased up the grassy knoll.

1080
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:24,227
I thought maybe our guys had shot back
and got one of them.

1081
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:27,122
I got to the parking lot.

1082
01:09:27,993 --> 01:09:31,065
All I saw were the railroad workers
and Dallas' finest.

1083
01:09:32,913 --> 01:09:36,986
- Secret Service. Come with us.
- No! Find the shooter!

1084
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:39,183
I want your pictures.

1085
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:40,482
Son of a bitch!

1086
01:09:40,626 --> 01:09:42,537
He put a hurt on me, but good.

1087
01:09:43,003 --> 01:09:47,394
They must've seen everything because
they knew what we had done all day.

1088
01:09:48,298 --> 01:09:51,176
I wasn't hard to find,
wearing that red raincoat.

1089
01:09:51,384 --> 01:09:54,217
- How many shots did you hear?
- Four to six.

1090
01:09:55,511 --> 01:09:56,626
Impossible!

1091
01:09:57,763 --> 01:09:59,242
You heard echoes!

1092
01:10:01,641 --> 01:10:05,111
We have three bullets and three shots
that came from the Book Depository.

1093
01:10:05,351 --> 01:10:07,626
- That's all we'll say.
- No, sir.

1094
01:10:08,271 --> 01:10:12,947
I saw a man shooting from behind
that fence. What are you going to do?

1095
01:10:13,566 --> 01:10:16,524
- You go out there and get him!
- That's taken care of!

1096
01:10:16,818 --> 01:10:20,208
You only heard three shots,
and don't discuss this with anyone.

1097
01:10:21,154 --> 01:10:22,428
No one. Understand?

1098
01:10:22,697 --> 01:10:26,212
Which is strange 'cause it's less
than 20 minutes after the assassination.

1099
01:10:26,449 --> 01:10:27,802
Get her out of here.

1100
01:10:27,951 --> 01:10:30,306
I knew something was crooked
as a dog's hind leg.

1101
01:10:31,786 --> 01:10:34,903
When I read my testimony
in the Warren Report...

1102
01:10:35,455 --> 01:10:37,571
...it was a total fabrication.

1103
01:10:37,957 --> 01:10:41,836
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison.
They've altered my statements.

1104
01:10:43,127 --> 01:10:44,606
This one says:

1105
01:10:44,962 --> 01:10:49,353
"Mercer couldn't identify any photograph
as being the man she observed...

1106
01:10:49,632 --> 01:10:52,783
"...slouched over the wheel
of the green truck." Not true.

1107
01:10:53,009 --> 01:10:55,523
I recognized him and I told them so.

1108
01:10:56,637 --> 01:10:57,911
Take your time.

1109
01:10:58,138 --> 01:10:58,934
I'm sure.

1110
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:00,886
And the sheriff's report...

1111
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:02,823
This is really strange.

1112
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:05,261
See that notarized signature?

1113
01:11:06,518 --> 01:11:07,917
That's not mine.

1114
01:11:08,145 --> 01:11:11,103
There wasn't any notary present
during my questioning.

1115
01:11:13,398 --> 01:11:15,514
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man...

1116
01:11:17,693 --> 01:11:19,763
...it's difficult to accept this.

1117
01:11:20,445 --> 01:11:23,323
Beverly, tell Mr. Garrison
about the Carousel Club.

1118
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:33,531
I used to go there to see Jack
and my friend, Jatta, who danced there.

1119
01:11:34,454 --> 01:11:36,729
It was a real swinging spot in town.

1120
01:11:36,914 --> 01:11:38,142
Everybody came.

1121
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:41,897
Businessmen, politicians from Austin,
LBJ's friends...

1122
01:11:42,543 --> 01:11:44,613
Dallas was a slowpokin' town then.

1123
01:11:44,878 --> 01:11:48,348
You chewed toothpicks, played dominoes,
spit, dated policemen.

1124
01:11:48,881 --> 01:11:52,157
But Jack was exciting.
There were always cops there.

1125
01:11:52,383 --> 01:11:56,058
Jack liked them around, even though
he threw out the drunks himself.

1126
01:11:56,886 --> 01:11:58,524
He had a violent temper.

1127
01:11:59,846 --> 01:12:02,679
Everyone in those days
knew Jack was in the mob.

1128
01:12:03,891 --> 01:12:06,359
Cops back then, they were bad.

1129
01:12:06,976 --> 01:12:09,854
They'd shake you down
for the money in your pocket.

1130
01:12:12,188 --> 01:12:13,462
What about Lee?

1131
01:12:14,898 --> 01:12:16,172
One time I came in.

1132
01:12:16,315 --> 01:12:20,547
Jack introduced me to two guys.
He says, "This is my friend, Lee..."

1133
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:25,300
I don't remember the other guy's name.

1134
01:12:25,489 --> 01:12:29,243
He was a weird-looking guy.
He had these eyebrows.

1135
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:31,827
And he looked like a buzzard.

1136
01:12:34,453 --> 01:12:36,728
Lee didn't make much of an impression.

1137
01:12:37,955 --> 01:12:39,911
He wasn't very handsome.

1138
01:12:40,207 --> 01:12:43,597
He didn't look like he had any money,
and he was in a bad mood.

1139
01:12:44,001 --> 01:12:45,957
So, I didn't pay him much mind.

1140
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:51,035
I may not remember a name,
but I always remember a face.

1141
01:12:52,924 --> 01:12:55,199
Later, when I saw him on television...

1142
01:12:56,718 --> 01:12:58,868
...I screamed, "My God, that's him!

1143
01:12:59,596 --> 01:13:01,234
"That's Jack's friend!"

1144
01:13:02,931 --> 01:13:04,649
Will you testify, Beverly?

1145
01:13:06,934 --> 01:13:09,971
- I don't think so.
- I thought we had an agreement.

1146
01:13:13,897 --> 01:13:17,810
- I don't want to be another statistic.
- We could call you in.

1147
01:13:18,441 --> 01:13:21,877
If they can kill the President
of the United States...

1148
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:27,165
...you think they'll think twice
about a two-bit showgirl like me?

1149
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:35,719
I understand the pressure you're under.

1150
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,292
Don't think that I don't.

1151
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:40,934
We both do.

1152
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:52,034
Mr. Chief Justice, do you understand
that I can't tell the truth in Dallas?

1153
01:13:53,549 --> 01:13:56,780
There are people here who do not want me
to tell the truth.

1154
01:13:57,093 --> 01:13:59,243
Who don't want me to have a retrial.

1155
01:13:59,887 --> 01:14:01,878
Why don't you just tell us now?

1156
01:14:02,513 --> 01:14:04,105
My life is in danger!

1157
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:06,941
If you request that I go to Washington...

1158
01:14:07,141 --> 01:14:10,178
That is, if you want to hear
further testimony from me.

1159
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,039
Can you take me with you?

1160
01:14:12,186 --> 01:14:13,938
No. It can't be done.

1161
01:14:14,563 --> 01:14:16,554
There would be no safe place for you.

1162
01:14:16,731 --> 01:14:19,199
We're not law-enforcement officers.

1163
01:14:20,233 --> 01:14:23,225
There's a great deal at stake in this matter.

1164
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:26,322
If I'm eliminated...

1165
01:14:26,738 --> 01:14:31,050
...there won't be any way of knowing
any bit of truth pertaining to my situation.

1166
01:14:32,909 --> 01:14:36,663
Consequently, a whole new form
of government will take over.

1167
01:14:38,871 --> 01:14:41,749
And I won't live to see you
some other time.

1168
01:14:42,499 --> 01:14:44,171
I want to tell the truth.

1169
01:14:44,334 --> 01:14:45,449
And then...

1170
01:14:45,667 --> 01:14:47,259
...leave this world.

1171
01:14:49,587 --> 01:14:52,943
The Zapruder film establishes
three shots in 5.6 seconds.

1172
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:57,824
I'm Oswald.

1173
01:14:58,969 --> 01:15:00,197
Time me.

1174
01:15:01,345 --> 01:15:02,380
Go.

1175
01:15:07,891 --> 01:15:08,641
Time?

1176
01:15:08,892 --> 01:15:10,484
Between six and seven seconds.

1177
01:15:10,643 --> 01:15:11,996
Without really aiming.

1178
01:15:12,144 --> 01:15:15,739
The second and third shots came
almost right on top of each other.

1179
01:15:16,605 --> 01:15:18,641
It takes a minimum of...

1180
01:15:18,857 --> 01:15:21,246
...2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.

1181
01:15:21,859 --> 01:15:24,214
The other problem is, there was a tree...

1182
01:15:24,402 --> 01:15:28,361
...blocking the first two shots
when fired in the Zapruder film.

1183
01:15:29,197 --> 01:15:32,712
Didn't Hoover say something
about leaves falling in November?

1184
01:15:33,367 --> 01:15:35,358
It was Texas live oak, Chief.

1185
01:15:36,035 --> 01:15:38,310
It sheds its leaves in early March.

1186
01:15:38,996 --> 01:15:42,272
Take this Carcano,
world's worst shoulder weapon...

1187
01:15:42,623 --> 01:15:46,901
...and try to hit a moving target
at 88 yards through heavy foliage.

1188
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:48,820
No way.

1189
01:15:51,921 --> 01:15:54,071
FBI tried two sets of tests.

1190
01:15:54,298 --> 01:15:57,335
Not one sharpshooter could match
Oswald's performance.

1191
01:15:57,841 --> 01:15:59,069
Not one.

1192
01:15:59,259 --> 01:16:01,648
Oswald was at best a medium shot.

1193
01:16:02,303 --> 01:16:04,373
The scope was defective on it too.

1194
01:16:04,971 --> 01:16:07,531
This is the whole essence
of the case to me.

1195
01:16:08,141 --> 01:16:10,530
The guy couldn't do the shooting.

1196
01:16:11,101 --> 01:16:12,375
Nobody could.

1197
01:16:12,769 --> 01:16:15,283
They sold this lemon
to the American public.

1198
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:20,188
The Zapruder film was the proof
they didn't count on.

1199
01:16:21,232 --> 01:16:22,870
We must get hold of it.

1200
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:27,152
It means we'll have to subpoena Time-Life.

1201
01:16:28,654 --> 01:16:30,326
Let me ask you something.

1202
01:16:30,697 --> 01:16:32,972
Why not just shoot Kennedy on Houston?

1203
01:16:33,449 --> 01:16:34,962
Plenty of time.

1204
01:16:36,368 --> 01:16:39,246
- He's out in the open.
- I keep asking myself the same thing.

1205
01:16:39,454 --> 01:16:41,763
- Frontal shot.
- Even if you miss him once...

1206
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,230
...if he accelerates, you get a second shot.

1207
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:46,371
The only reason to get him on Elm...

1208
01:16:47,125 --> 01:16:49,958
...is you got him in a triangulated crossfire.

1209
01:16:51,045 --> 01:16:53,639
You put a team there down at the fence.

1210
01:16:53,963 --> 01:16:56,477
Frontal shot. Flat, low trajectory.

1211
01:16:57,173 --> 01:17:00,449
Put a third team down in this building...

1212
01:17:00,676 --> 01:17:01,904
...on a low floor.

1213
01:17:02,052 --> 01:17:05,124
When Kennedy gets in the kill zone,
it's a turkey shoot.

1214
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:09,459
How many men?

1215
01:17:11,183 --> 01:17:14,892
One shooter. One spotter on a radio.
Maybe three teams.

1216
01:17:17,521 --> 01:17:20,638
These are professional riflemen.
Serious people.

1217
01:17:21,983 --> 01:17:23,098
Hunters.

1218
01:17:24,984 --> 01:17:26,212
Patient.

1219
01:17:28,236 --> 01:17:30,386
It takes skill to kill with a rifle.

1220
01:17:33,616 --> 01:17:38,087
That's why no chief executive's
been executed with one in 200 years.

1221
01:17:41,954 --> 01:17:42,943
Three...

1222
01:17:43,956 --> 01:17:44,991
...two...

1223
01:17:46,541 --> 01:17:47,496
...one.

1224
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:59,251
Main Street's over there.

1225
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:02,769
Original parade route on the way
to the Trade Mart...

1226
01:18:03,719 --> 01:18:05,038
...is too far, right?

1227
01:18:05,179 --> 01:18:06,248
Too far.

1228
01:18:06,387 --> 01:18:10,175
Impossible shot,
so they change the parade route.

1229
01:18:10,599 --> 01:18:13,477
Bring him down here.
Moving at a normal 25 mph.

1230
01:18:13,684 --> 01:18:16,835
They knew the motorcade would have
to slow down to about 10 mph...

1231
01:18:17,062 --> 01:18:20,054
...to make that turn there.
And that's where they got him.

1232
01:18:27,652 --> 01:18:30,086
Who do you think changed
the parade route?

1233
01:18:30,278 --> 01:18:33,156
Beats me. Secret Service,
city officials, Dallas Police.

1234
01:18:34,115 --> 01:18:36,026
You know who was the mayor at the time?

1235
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,315
Roy Cabell.

1236
01:18:37,743 --> 01:18:39,779
- Guess who his brother is?
- Who?

1237
01:18:40,745 --> 01:18:42,383
General Charles Cabell.

1238
01:18:42,996 --> 01:18:44,714
Deputy director of the CIA.

1239
01:18:44,873 --> 01:18:47,910
Kennedy fired him in '61
because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco.

1240
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:52,203
Moved back to the Pentagon
and called Kennedy a traitor.

1241
01:18:52,628 --> 01:18:54,346
When he came to New Orleans...

1242
01:18:54,504 --> 01:18:58,383
...to address the Foreign Policy
Association, know who introduced him?

1243
01:18:59,257 --> 01:19:00,770
Our friend, Clay Shaw.

1244
01:19:00,924 --> 01:19:02,642
Didn't the Warren Commission call him?

1245
01:19:02,801 --> 01:19:05,031
His boss was the one
on the Warren Commission...

1246
01:19:05,219 --> 01:19:07,369
...who handled the leads
in the intelligence community.

1247
01:19:07,554 --> 01:19:10,307
- Allen Dulles?
- Head of the CIA since '53.

1248
01:19:11,599 --> 01:19:13,351
Kennedy fired them both.

1249
01:19:14,559 --> 01:19:17,027
Cabell was his Deputy for nine years.

1250
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:21,277
Talk about the fox investigating
the chicken coop.

1251
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:25,454
Now, we'll have to subpoena them both.

1252
01:19:37,867 --> 01:19:40,256
Clay Bertrand? Sure, I know him.

1253
01:19:40,535 --> 01:19:42,014
Comes to the Quarter.

1254
01:19:42,245 --> 01:19:45,999
Who is he? I've been to all the bars.
Nobody wants to talk.

1255
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:49,371
Why should they talk to you?

1256
01:19:50,667 --> 01:19:54,296
I told your uncle, I never met a lawman
who wasn't a punk.

1257
01:19:58,548 --> 01:20:01,506
A big-shot businessman.
I seen him on the TV news...

1258
01:20:01,716 --> 01:20:03,707
...with all the other big shots.

1259
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:06,137
The guy's a fag, you know?

1260
01:20:06,678 --> 01:20:08,191
Goes by another name.

1261
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:09,873
What name?

1262
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:11,753
Shaw.

1263
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,209
Clay Shaw.

1264
01:20:13,599 --> 01:20:15,351
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?

1265
01:20:16,226 --> 01:20:18,660
Guy who ran the International Trade Mart?

1266
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:22,467
What's the mystery?
Everybody down here knows him.

1267
01:20:23,773 --> 01:20:26,128
Then why does he call himself Bertrand?

1268
01:20:26,316 --> 01:20:28,876
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?

1269
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,875
Will you give us a little help
on that grand jury thing?

1270
01:20:33,946 --> 01:20:35,538
I hope so. We could use it.

1271
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:37,783
Your hunch was right, Boss.

1272
01:20:38,032 --> 01:20:39,943
But it's even spookier than we thought.

1273
01:20:40,117 --> 01:20:44,633
Starting in September '63 on,
two months before the assassination...

1274
01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:48,116
...there are sightings of Oswald
all over Dallas.

1275
01:20:48,331 --> 01:20:52,802
Buying ammunition,
getting a telescopic sight fixed.

1276
01:20:53,669 --> 01:20:54,863
Going to rifle ranges.

1277
01:20:55,002 --> 01:20:58,915
Early November,
at a downtown Dallas Lincoln dealership...

1278
01:20:59,172 --> 01:21:02,528
...he tells the salesman:
- Let's take it over for a test drive.

1279
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:06,591
Despite the fact he has no license,
and doesn't know how to drive...

1280
01:21:07,052 --> 01:21:10,169
...he hits the curves like A.J. Foyt
at the Indy 500.

1281
01:21:10,472 --> 01:21:13,589
Beauregard later told his boss
that he drove like a madman.

1282
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:17,519
$300 down now, Mr. Oswald,
you can drive out of here.

1283
01:21:17,768 --> 01:21:19,759
What? For this heap?

1284
01:21:20,812 --> 01:21:24,691
No honest working man can afford to buy
a car in this goddamn country anymore.

1285
01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:27,090
Maybe I'll go to Russia and buy one.

1286
01:21:27,316 --> 01:21:30,991
Really dumb dialogue like he's trying
to draw attention to himself.

1287
01:21:32,611 --> 01:21:38,004
Salesman remembers him as about 5' 7",
but his draft card says he's actually 5' 11 ".

1288
01:21:38,783 --> 01:21:42,458
Other witnesses see him on several
separate days at different firing ranges.

1289
01:21:43,118 --> 01:21:45,029
One time, November 9...

1290
01:21:45,245 --> 01:21:48,521
...he decides to practice
on the next guy's target.

1291
01:21:48,748 --> 01:21:52,502
I didn't pay for a target
just to have you shoot at it!

1292
01:21:53,834 --> 01:21:55,984
I'm sorry, buddy.

1293
01:21:56,961 --> 01:22:00,237
I thought I was shooting
at that son of a bitch Kennedy.

1294
01:22:00,672 --> 01:22:03,664
As subtle as a cockroach
crawling across a white rug.

1295
01:22:03,924 --> 01:22:06,279
Then he shows up at Sylvia Odio's...

1296
01:22:06,759 --> 01:22:10,229
...a Cuban lady in Dallas
in the anti-Castro underground.

1297
01:22:10,512 --> 01:22:13,390
The two Cubans introduce him
as Leon Oswald.

1298
01:22:15,974 --> 01:22:17,930
Something about the man bothers her.

1299
01:22:18,101 --> 01:22:20,820
48 hours later, one of the Cubans calls her.

1300
01:22:21,604 --> 01:22:23,754
What did you think of me
and Oswald last night?

1301
01:22:23,938 --> 01:22:25,337
I don't care about Oswald.

1302
01:22:25,481 --> 01:22:28,837
You know what he said to us?
"Cubans don't have guts, 'cause Kennedy...

1303
01:22:29,067 --> 01:22:32,139
"...should have been killed
after the Bay of Pigs by a Cuban."

1304
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:35,750
It's like he's giving her information
she doesn't even ask for.

1305
01:22:35,988 --> 01:22:38,138
She's scared and doesn't see him again...

1306
01:22:38,448 --> 01:22:41,201
...till she sees Oswald's picture
in the paper.

1307
01:22:41,575 --> 01:22:43,725
But the Warren Commission
says that Sylvia...

1308
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:47,505
...has bad eyesight because
they have Oswald in Mexico...

1309
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,389
...trying to get back into Cuba.

1310
01:22:50,957 --> 01:22:53,994
The CIA has a camera
outside the Cuban Embassy.

1311
01:22:54,375 --> 01:22:56,047
And they say that this...

1312
01:22:57,128 --> 01:22:59,039
...is Oswald in Mexico.

1313
01:23:00,713 --> 01:23:03,625
If this is Oswald,
it must be our third Oswald.

1314
01:23:04,299 --> 01:23:08,292
The Warren Commission made great efforts
to make him a Communist.

1315
01:23:08,802 --> 01:23:13,398
I think the point of the Mexican episode
was to lay the blame on Fidel Castro.

1316
01:23:15,098 --> 01:23:17,453
If Oswald, or someone purporting
to be Oswald...

1317
01:23:17,641 --> 01:23:21,316
...had gotten into Cuba, come back,
and then killed the President...

1318
01:23:22,603 --> 01:23:25,515
...the American public would've supported
a Cuban invasion.

1319
01:23:25,731 --> 01:23:28,564
I even have doubts about this photo, Boss.

1320
01:23:29,233 --> 01:23:32,111
This convicted Oswald in the public's mind.

1321
01:23:32,484 --> 01:23:35,920
But Oswald told Capt. Fritz
that the photo was a fake.

1322
01:23:36,279 --> 01:23:37,632
This is not me!

1323
01:23:37,989 --> 01:23:41,459
- That came from Janet Williams' garage.
- I never saw this picture.

1324
01:23:41,699 --> 01:23:46,250
It's my face but it's superimposed.
The rest is not me.

1325
01:23:46,536 --> 01:23:49,608
I know photographic work.
That picture was made by someone else!

1326
01:23:50,247 --> 01:23:52,317
I took this picture to two experts.

1327
01:23:53,082 --> 01:23:55,391
Look at how the shadows on the nose...

1328
01:23:55,792 --> 01:23:58,147
...fall in a straight line, like it's high noon.

1329
01:23:58,335 --> 01:24:01,850
But the shadow on the ground is more
like late afternoon or early morning.

1330
01:24:02,088 --> 01:24:03,521
It's not the same time.

1331
01:24:03,672 --> 01:24:05,947
And see the crop marks across the chin?

1332
01:24:06,217 --> 01:24:08,856
This head is pasted onto another body.

1333
01:24:09,302 --> 01:24:11,736
Implicating him with the rifle and the gun.

1334
01:24:11,928 --> 01:24:15,000
Who the hell are you?
Alex Hidell or Lee Oswald?

1335
01:24:18,808 --> 01:24:20,685
You're the policeman, you work it out.

1336
01:24:20,851 --> 01:24:23,411
Now it gets positively spooky.

1337
01:24:23,811 --> 01:24:28,202
In January 1961, in New Orleans,
at the Bolton Ford dealership...

1338
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:31,449
...when the Oswald we know is in Russia...

1339
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:35,464
...there is a man using the name of Oswald
to buy trucks...

1340
01:24:35,736 --> 01:24:37,613
...for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.

1341
01:24:37,779 --> 01:24:39,610
Salesman never sees him again.

1342
01:24:39,781 --> 01:24:44,093
But who's on the Articles Of Incorporation
of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?

1343
01:24:45,284 --> 01:24:46,478
Guy Banister.

1344
01:24:47,244 --> 01:24:50,793
Banister has someone using
the name Oswald to buy the trucks.

1345
01:24:51,872 --> 01:24:55,262
Hoover at the FBI has a memo
dated June of 1960...

1346
01:24:56,125 --> 01:24:59,595
...that someone may be using
Oswald's passport and identity.

1347
01:25:00,003 --> 01:25:02,437
They created Oswald from day one.

1348
01:25:02,879 --> 01:25:06,633
Like a dummy corporation in the Bahamas.
Just move him around a board.

1349
01:25:07,341 --> 01:25:08,933
Anybody want to quit?

1350
01:25:11,511 --> 01:25:13,945
Dumb question. Put your hands down.

1351
01:25:15,764 --> 01:25:17,402
I found Clay Bertrand.

1352
01:25:18,599 --> 01:25:20,635
Grab your socks and hose and pull.

1353
01:25:21,184 --> 01:25:22,936
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw.

1354
01:25:23,977 --> 01:25:27,049
- Director of the Trade Mart?
- Former director.

1355
01:25:27,397 --> 01:25:28,512
Incredible.

1356
01:25:28,897 --> 01:25:30,967
Can you get some sworn statements?

1357
01:25:31,315 --> 01:25:33,783
That'll be tough. Nobody's talking.

1358
01:25:34,735 --> 01:25:36,965
Let's have him in for a chat.

1359
01:25:37,487 --> 01:25:39,398
I hate to get him dragged into this.

1360
01:25:39,572 --> 01:25:42,882
He's done so much for the city,
restoring the Quarter.

1361
01:25:43,365 --> 01:25:47,119
Remember, we saw him at a fund-raiser.
Seems like such a nice man.

1362
01:25:47,618 --> 01:25:51,088
It'll be off the record.
I'll bring him in on a Sunday.

1363
01:25:53,122 --> 01:25:55,431
A quiet little chat between gentlemen.

1364
01:26:12,218 --> 01:26:13,890
In heavy fighting in Vietnam today...

1365
01:26:14,053 --> 01:26:17,170
...seven more American soldiers died
and 23 wounded.

1366
01:26:17,431 --> 01:26:20,264
The body count for this week
now stands at 67 Americans...

1367
01:26:20,474 --> 01:26:23,193
...and 626 enemy soldiers killed in action.

1368
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:27,973
President Johnson said he regretted
there's no end in sight to the war...

1369
01:26:28,688 --> 01:26:31,202
...where 500,000 US troops
are now fighting.

1370
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:32,919
We face more cost...

1371
01:26:33,733 --> 01:26:34,927
...more loss...

1372
01:26:35,651 --> 01:26:37,004
...and more agony.

1373
01:26:37,277 --> 01:26:39,711
Come hunt for Easter eggs.

1374
01:26:39,904 --> 01:26:44,056
That's the kids' job. You know I don't like
these tribal rituals, anyway.

1375
01:26:45,032 --> 01:26:47,387
I'm talking to Clay Shaw this morning.

1376
01:26:47,617 --> 01:26:49,926
We're going to Antoine's with the kids!

1377
01:26:50,202 --> 01:26:52,272
I told you I was talking to Shaw.

1378
01:26:52,496 --> 01:26:54,851
In the middle of Easter Sunday?

1379
01:26:55,248 --> 01:26:58,285
When I scheduled it,
I didn't know it was a holiday.

1380
01:26:58,625 --> 01:27:00,263
Look at the calendar!

1381
01:27:00,502 --> 01:27:02,732
You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.

1382
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:04,933
Clay Shaw is important.

1383
01:27:05,088 --> 01:27:07,283
- And we're not.
- I didn't say that.

1384
01:27:08,715 --> 01:27:10,307
I didn't say that.

1385
01:27:11,258 --> 01:27:14,250
You're missing most of your life
and you don't know it.

1386
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:16,426
The kids are missing out, too.

1387
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:21,378
- You're not the only one making sacrifices.
- I'll be there by 2:00, I promise.

1388
01:27:22,475 --> 01:27:24,113
Just start without me.

1389
01:27:33,691 --> 01:27:36,251
Mr. Garrison, what can I do for you
on Easter Sunday?

1390
01:27:36,443 --> 01:27:38,593
I'm sorry to interrupt this holiday.

1391
01:27:39,028 --> 01:27:43,180
But this conversation is best kept out
of the everyday bustle of this office.

1392
01:27:43,698 --> 01:27:45,097
I don't understand.

1393
01:27:45,241 --> 01:27:48,995
In an investigation we're conducting,
your name keeps coming up.

1394
01:27:49,701 --> 01:27:50,690
Can't imagine where.

1395
01:27:51,369 --> 01:27:54,361
We've talked to a number of men
who claim to know you.

1396
01:27:55,206 --> 01:27:56,924
Do you know a David Logan?

1397
01:27:57,124 --> 01:27:59,035
No. Never heard of him.

1398
01:28:00,042 --> 01:28:01,077
Perry Russo?

1399
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:02,164
No.

1400
01:28:03,294 --> 01:28:04,807
Willie O'Keefe?

1401
01:28:06,296 --> 01:28:08,366
I don't know anyone by that name.

1402
01:28:09,049 --> 01:28:12,724
Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you
at the Masquerade Bar in the Quarter.

1403
01:28:13,802 --> 01:28:17,511
Then you had him over for dinner
at your apartment on Dauphine Street.

1404
01:28:17,762 --> 01:28:20,481
- Do you recall that?
- I don't know this man.

1405
01:28:21,807 --> 01:28:23,240
Be still my heart.

1406
01:28:23,683 --> 01:28:26,038
Obviously, I wouldn't have him over.

1407
01:28:26,227 --> 01:28:27,785
Hope you like squab.

1408
01:28:29,812 --> 01:28:30,961
Champagne?

1409
01:28:31,563 --> 01:28:35,841
Perhaps a few more details about
the evening will refresh your memory.

1410
01:28:42,154 --> 01:28:46,193
Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served
by a uniformed waiter, a colored man.

1411
01:28:47,533 --> 01:28:51,526
You sat at one end and he at the other,
which he found unusual...

1412
01:28:52,411 --> 01:28:54,481
...because the table was so long.

1413
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:56,270
How was your mousse?

1414
01:28:56,413 --> 01:28:58,643
Bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?

1415
01:28:58,832 --> 01:29:00,060
Not at all.

1416
01:29:00,833 --> 01:29:02,425
But I do have...

1417
01:29:02,585 --> 01:29:04,894
...a lovely Chippendale dining table.

1418
01:29:05,253 --> 01:29:08,723
I often have a friend sit at one end
while I sit at the other.

1419
01:29:09,048 --> 01:29:12,165
It's precisely the point
of a long dining table.

1420
01:29:12,966 --> 01:29:15,605
The splendor of the meal
adds to its enjoyment.

1421
01:29:16,094 --> 01:29:18,005
I imagine a uniformed waiter helps.

1422
01:29:18,179 --> 01:29:20,568
It adds elegance, for which I confess...

1423
01:29:20,931 --> 01:29:22,649
...a weakness now and then.

1424
01:29:23,224 --> 01:29:24,657
I call him Smedley.

1425
01:29:25,726 --> 01:29:29,878
His real name's Frankie Jenkins,
but it would be so uncouth during dinner...

1426
01:29:30,812 --> 01:29:32,928
...to turn toward the kitchen and holler...

1427
01:29:33,106 --> 01:29:34,539
..."Frankie!"

1428
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:41,487
Where is all this leading to?

1429
01:29:41,945 --> 01:29:43,822
After dinner, you paid him to have sex.

1430
01:29:47,615 --> 01:29:49,606
That is absolute nonsense.

1431
01:29:50,450 --> 01:29:54,443
The Quarter is filled
with vivid imaginations, dear Mr. Garrison.

1432
01:29:54,870 --> 01:29:57,703
Grimy young hoodlums who will say
and do anything!

1433
01:29:58,330 --> 01:29:59,888
Mr. O'Keefe told us...

1434
01:30:00,332 --> 01:30:03,483
...David Ferrie came to the house
with another young man.

1435
01:30:05,711 --> 01:30:07,429
- Who?
- David Ferrie.

1436
01:30:08,797 --> 01:30:10,389
I don't know that name.

1437
01:30:10,923 --> 01:30:14,438
Never having met Mr. O'Keefe,
I couldn't have met Mr. Ferrie.

1438
01:30:28,185 --> 01:30:29,584
You're mine, Mary.

1439
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:33,478
The four of you partied early
into the morning hours.

1440
01:30:33,730 --> 01:30:35,209
Look at this picture.

1441
01:30:36,231 --> 01:30:38,984
I've never met anyone
of such bizarre appearance.

1442
01:30:47,948 --> 01:30:51,577
Only way you get this,
you do exactly what I say. I'm the man.

1443
01:30:53,827 --> 01:30:55,943
You know the name Clay Bertrand?

1444
01:30:56,246 --> 01:30:57,474
Clay Bertrand.

1445
01:30:58,747 --> 01:31:02,023
A man with a similar name worked
at the Chamber of Commerce.

1446
01:31:02,249 --> 01:31:04,888
- That the man you had in mind?
- No, it was not.

1447
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:08,038
Can you identify this man?

1448
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:12,299
Naturally. You claim Mr. Oswald
also had dinner with me?

1449
01:31:12,757 --> 01:31:15,271
Have you ever met Lee Harvey Oswald?

1450
01:31:16,009 --> 01:31:19,524
You have me consorting
with a sordid cast of characters.

1451
01:31:19,803 --> 01:31:22,237
- Please answer the question.
- 'Course not.

1452
01:31:22,805 --> 01:31:24,557
The assassination was such a pity.

1453
01:31:24,723 --> 01:31:28,238
In fact I admired Kennedy.
Man of true panache.

1454
01:31:28,559 --> 01:31:30,311
Wife of impeccable taste.

1455
01:31:30,935 --> 01:31:34,007
Let's order without your daddy.
He won't mind.

1456
01:31:34,522 --> 01:31:36,194
I want a Shirley Temple!

1457
01:31:36,481 --> 01:31:38,551
Kids, put your water guns away.

1458
01:31:39,233 --> 01:31:40,746
When's Daddy coming?

1459
01:31:41,818 --> 01:31:43,251
He's coming soon.

1460
01:31:43,611 --> 01:31:46,808
He's sorry he's late,
but he promised he'd be here.

1461
01:31:47,113 --> 01:31:49,502
Daddy never keeps his promises.

1462
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:56,470
This Italian newspaper article says...

1463
01:31:57,245 --> 01:32:00,715
...you were a board member
of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy.

1464
01:32:01,165 --> 01:32:05,124
This company was created by the CIA
for the transfer of funds in Italy...

1465
01:32:05,376 --> 01:32:08,015
...for illegal political-espionage activities.

1466
01:32:08,378 --> 01:32:12,132
Says that this company was expelled
from Italy for those activities.

1467
01:32:12,506 --> 01:32:16,704
I'm well aware of that asinine article.
I'm thinking of suing that rag.

1468
01:32:16,967 --> 01:32:20,721
It also says this company is linked
to the Schlumberger Tool Company...

1469
01:32:20,969 --> 01:32:24,644
...in Louisiana, which provided arms
to David Ferrie and his Cubans.

1470
01:32:24,972 --> 01:32:26,325
You're reaching.

1471
01:32:26,474 --> 01:32:27,429
Am I?

1472
01:32:27,557 --> 01:32:30,993
I'm an international businessman.
The Trade Mart I founded...

1473
01:32:31,269 --> 01:32:35,228
...is America's commercial pipeline
to Latin America. I trade everywhere.

1474
01:32:36,189 --> 01:32:39,465
Like all businessmen,
I am accused of all things.

1475
01:32:40,024 --> 01:32:44,063
I go about my business, make money,
help society the best I can...

1476
01:32:44,319 --> 01:32:46,913
...and try to promote free trade
in this world.

1477
01:32:48,489 --> 01:32:51,447
Have you ever been a contract agent
for the CIA?

1478
01:32:56,327 --> 01:32:57,646
And if I were...

1479
01:32:58,579 --> 01:33:01,810
...do you believe I would be here today...

1480
01:33:03,082 --> 01:33:05,073
...talking to somebody like you?

1481
01:33:10,837 --> 01:33:13,351
- People like you don't have to.
- May I go?

1482
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:16,102
People like you walk
between the raindrops.

1483
01:33:17,591 --> 01:33:18,865
May I go?

1484
01:33:21,011 --> 01:33:21,841
Yes.

1485
01:33:30,350 --> 01:33:35,060
Regardless of what you may think of me,
I am a patriot first and foremost.

1486
01:33:35,354 --> 01:33:37,663
I've spent half my life in the military...

1487
01:33:37,856 --> 01:33:39,608
...defending my country.

1488
01:33:39,773 --> 01:33:43,812
You're the first person I've met who
considers it patriotic to kill the President.

1489
01:33:44,068 --> 01:33:45,865
You are way out of line.

1490
01:33:46,486 --> 01:33:49,683
It's getting late.
That's all the questions we have.

1491
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:52,799
Thank you for your honesty
and for coming in.

1492
01:33:52,991 --> 01:33:54,743
I enjoyed meeting with you.

1493
01:33:55,951 --> 01:33:58,784
And you, Miss Cox.
It's been most pleasant.

1494
01:34:04,415 --> 01:34:08,567
I extend to you and your families
my best wishes for a happy Easter.

1495
01:34:18,049 --> 01:34:20,609
"One may smile, and smile
and be a villain."

1496
01:34:22,052 --> 01:34:24,122
Goddamn it! We've got one of them.

1497
01:34:24,429 --> 01:34:25,305
See that?

1498
01:34:42,650 --> 01:34:43,924
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

1499
01:34:48,737 --> 01:34:49,886
Tough day.

1500
01:34:50,030 --> 01:34:51,543
Where you been?

1501
01:34:52,573 --> 01:34:54,006
My sympathies.

1502
01:34:54,158 --> 01:34:57,355
I'm sorry, the meeting
took much longer than expected.

1503
01:34:57,868 --> 01:34:59,301
Just a second.

1504
01:34:59,453 --> 01:35:02,126
We waited for hours, Jim!

1505
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:05,628
You could've telephoned.

1506
01:35:05,791 --> 01:35:10,182
I can only say I'm sorry.
I just don't have rabbits on my mind.

1507
01:35:11,378 --> 01:35:12,891
You know what I think?

1508
01:35:13,046 --> 01:35:16,038
You care more about John Kennedy
than your own family.

1509
01:35:16,673 --> 01:35:20,427
All day the kids asked, "Where's Daddy?"
What should I tell them?

1510
01:35:21,509 --> 01:35:22,828
I don't know!

1511
01:35:23,177 --> 01:35:26,055
The truth! I'm doing my job
to make sure they grow up...

1512
01:35:26,262 --> 01:35:30,255
...in a country where justice won't be
a vanished idea in history books...

1513
01:35:30,557 --> 01:35:32,627
...like dinosaurs or Atlantis.

1514
01:35:32,850 --> 01:35:35,683
It doesn't replace a husband
or a father on Easter Sunday.

1515
01:35:35,894 --> 01:35:37,646
It's going to get worse!

1516
01:35:43,649 --> 01:35:45,765
I beat you again, you must give me a raise.

1517
01:35:45,942 --> 01:35:47,978
Who can you brag to?

1518
01:35:50,445 --> 01:35:53,642
Who killed President Kennedy?
Was there a conspiracy here?

1519
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:56,299
I don't know what you're talking about.

1520
01:35:57,284 --> 01:35:59,718
Clear the door! Watch out! Move!

1521
01:36:02,579 --> 01:36:04,729
Congratulations. You're Page One.

1522
01:36:04,997 --> 01:36:10,151
Ain't nice, it says, we've spent over $8,000
on unexplained investigative expenses...

1523
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:12,098
...since November, 1966.

1524
01:36:12,378 --> 01:36:13,447
Goddamn!

1525
01:36:13,795 --> 01:36:17,788
They went to the public records, got
vouchers we requested for withdrawals.

1526
01:36:18,215 --> 01:36:19,887
Shaw got them on our tail.

1527
01:36:20,133 --> 01:36:23,091
It could have been Ferrie,
Martin, Andrews, any of them.

1528
01:36:23,301 --> 01:36:26,930
Or they talked to Ruby 'cause of
they're on our asses for a measly $8,000.

1529
01:36:27,179 --> 01:36:29,249
They're hunting the news,
it's their business.

1530
01:36:29,431 --> 01:36:32,025
You'd think they'd understand
what were doing.

1531
01:36:32,391 --> 01:36:35,064
Getting angry doesn't accomplish
a damn thing.

1532
01:36:37,519 --> 01:36:38,713
Son of a bitch.

1533
01:36:39,479 --> 01:36:41,595
This changes everything now.

1534
01:36:42,189 --> 01:36:43,508
What do you mean?

1535
01:36:46,026 --> 01:36:49,496
Either we pull out now
or we go through heavy flak together.

1536
01:36:52,488 --> 01:36:56,242
Bear in mind, this may affect
the rest of your careers, your lives.

1537
01:36:57,700 --> 01:36:59,850
Any one who wants to pull out now...

1538
01:37:00,202 --> 01:37:05,196
...I assure you there will be no ill feelings
and I will reassign you to regular duties.

1539
01:37:09,082 --> 01:37:11,232
There it is then, thank you.

1540
01:37:11,834 --> 01:37:13,665
It means a great deal to me.

1541
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:20,270
I'm giving this office $6,000
from my National Guard savings account.

1542
01:37:21,467 --> 01:37:22,866
So we can continue.

1543
01:37:23,675 --> 01:37:26,826
I'll make speeches where I can
and make additional money.

1544
01:37:27,470 --> 01:37:30,348
What shall I tell them?
Their piling up outside the door.

1545
01:37:30,555 --> 01:37:33,228
They want a statement.
The phones are going crazy.

1546
01:37:33,433 --> 01:37:36,266
I won't confirm, deny nor discuss, Sharon.

1547
01:37:38,018 --> 01:37:39,895
Goodbye, ladies and gentlemen.

1548
01:37:42,022 --> 01:37:44,741
I'm going home
to get a decent day's work done.

1549
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:48,649
Mr. Garrison's own silence on the subject
has raised some interesting questions.

1550
01:37:48,901 --> 01:37:52,450
With taxpayer money,
has he uncovered valuable new evidence?

1551
01:37:52,988 --> 01:37:57,584
Or is he merely saving the information
to gain exposure at a national level?

1552
01:37:57,991 --> 01:38:00,789
Mr. Garrison should have
some explanation.

1553
01:38:01,076 --> 01:38:03,431
Did your office plant that garbage
in the paper?

1554
01:38:03,620 --> 01:38:05,531
- Who is this?
- You know damn well.

1555
01:38:05,704 --> 01:38:07,615
- Dave?
- You got it. Listen.

1556
01:38:07,956 --> 01:38:09,947
You're the only straight-shooter there.

1557
01:38:10,124 --> 01:38:12,001
I want an answer! Did you plant it?

1558
01:38:12,167 --> 01:38:15,603
Do you think we're nuts?
It's been a zoo since that broke.

1559
01:38:15,919 --> 01:38:18,228
Reporters everywhere.
Do you think we want that?

1560
01:38:18,421 --> 01:38:21,060
Somebody planted that fucking story!

1561
01:38:21,257 --> 01:38:24,806
I'm one of fucking Garrison's suspects.
I can't go home!

1562
01:38:25,092 --> 01:38:28,050
The maggots are everywhere!
Do you know what you've done to me?

1563
01:38:28,262 --> 01:38:29,536
Calm down.

1564
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:30,873
From here on...

1565
01:38:31,139 --> 01:38:32,936
...l'm a fucking dead man!

1566
01:38:33,265 --> 01:38:35,859
You weren't even mentioned in the story.

1567
01:38:36,725 --> 01:38:39,797
Meet me in the lobby
of the Fontainebleau in 20 minutes.

1568
01:38:40,478 --> 01:38:44,790
I guarantee the boss will protect you.
He likes you. He likes your mind.

1569
01:38:49,777 --> 01:38:52,052
I just don't know who to trust anymore.

1570
01:38:52,237 --> 01:38:56,389
I suppose I could use a pot of hot coffee
and a few packs of Luckys.

1571
01:38:58,032 --> 01:38:59,226
Anything new?

1572
01:38:59,658 --> 01:39:01,376
Who are you scared of?

1573
01:39:01,618 --> 01:39:04,132
Everybody. The Agency, mob, Cubans.

1574
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:06,894
Follow the Cubans.

1575
01:39:07,038 --> 01:39:09,871
Check them out. Here, in Miami. Dallas.

1576
01:39:11,416 --> 01:39:13,611
Check out Eladio del Valle.

1577
01:39:13,835 --> 01:39:17,032
He was my paymaster
when I flew missions into Cuba.

1578
01:39:17,461 --> 01:39:21,056
You're on the right track.
Don't write this down!

1579
01:39:21,506 --> 01:39:23,736
I ain't cooperating with no one!

1580
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:27,053
There's a death warrant for me!
Don't you get it?

1581
01:39:27,593 --> 01:39:29,390
Damn! Wait a minute!

1582
01:39:29,553 --> 01:39:32,306
You ain't bugged, are you?
Son of a bitch, Lou!

1583
01:39:32,806 --> 01:39:33,875
Are you?

1584
01:39:34,265 --> 01:39:35,903
I play square. No bugs.

1585
01:39:36,349 --> 01:39:39,785
I'd love you to go on the record,
but I'm in no hurry.

1586
01:39:40,352 --> 01:39:42,388
I haven't slept since that article.

1587
01:39:42,562 --> 01:39:46,396
- Why'd you get me involved?
- Did we involve you? Or did Shaw?

1588
01:39:47,107 --> 01:39:49,940
Cocksucking faggot.
He got me by the balls.

1589
01:39:50,317 --> 01:39:53,229
- What do you mean?
- Photographs, compromising stuff.

1590
01:39:53,778 --> 01:39:54,927
He'll use them, too.

1591
01:39:55,071 --> 01:39:56,663
Agency plays for keeps.

1592
01:39:56,989 --> 01:40:00,538
Oswald was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.
I taught him everything.

1593
01:40:01,367 --> 01:40:04,723
He was a wannabe. No one liked him.
Thought he was a snitch.

1594
01:40:05,077 --> 01:40:06,476
But I treated him good.

1595
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:09,453
He wanted his kid to grow up
with a chance.

1596
01:40:10,206 --> 01:40:12,117
What's this? What's going on?

1597
01:40:14,375 --> 01:40:15,649
Don't let him in.

1598
01:40:15,793 --> 01:40:17,545
No one's coming in here.

1599
01:40:21,130 --> 01:40:22,358
Black. Give it to me.

1600
01:40:22,506 --> 01:40:24,974
Black. My neck is killing me.

1601
01:40:25,925 --> 01:40:29,679
I've had cancer for years.
Been working with mice to find a cure.

1602
01:40:30,261 --> 01:40:31,933
Did you work for the CIA?

1603
01:40:32,930 --> 01:40:36,161
You sound like it's a remote experience
in ancient history.

1604
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:38,392
You don't leave the Agency.

1605
01:40:39,601 --> 01:40:42,559
- Once you're in, they got you for life.
- And Shaw?

1606
01:40:43,187 --> 01:40:45,781
Shaw's an untouchable. Highest clearance.

1607
01:40:46,188 --> 01:40:48,782
Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans, all Agency.

1608
01:40:50,316 --> 01:40:51,192
Ruby?

1609
01:40:55,361 --> 01:40:58,114
Jack was a pimp.
A bagman for the Dallas mob.

1610
01:40:58,614 --> 01:41:01,082
Ran guns to Castro
when he was on our side.

1611
01:41:01,408 --> 01:41:03,968
Castro was almost with us
till we tried to whack him.

1612
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:06,070
Everybody keeps flipping sides.

1613
01:41:06,244 --> 01:41:07,757
It's fun and games.

1614
01:41:08,079 --> 01:41:11,310
- How do the mob figure in this?
- They're Agency too.

1615
01:41:11,706 --> 01:41:16,700
The CIA and the Mafia worked together
for years trying to whack out the beard.

1616
01:41:17,377 --> 01:41:19,607
There's more to this than you could dream!

1617
01:41:19,795 --> 01:41:22,912
Check out something called
"Operation Mongoose."

1618
01:41:23,464 --> 01:41:26,536
Government, Pentagon stuff.
They're in charge.

1619
01:41:27,175 --> 01:41:29,769
But who pulls whose chain? Who knows?

1620
01:41:30,677 --> 01:41:33,635
"Oh, what a deadly web we weave
when we practice to deceive."

1621
01:41:33,847 --> 01:41:35,360
Who killed the President?

1622
01:41:35,514 --> 01:41:38,108
Why don't you fucking stop it? Shit!

1623
01:41:39,517 --> 01:41:42,077
This is too big for you, you know that?

1624
01:41:42,269 --> 01:41:46,581
Who did the President? Fuck!
It's a mystery.

1625
01:41:47,147 --> 01:41:49,741
It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle
inside an enigma!

1626
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:52,818
The shooters don't even know!
Don't you get it?

1627
01:41:53,068 --> 01:41:55,821
Fuck, man! I can't keep talking like this!

1628
01:41:56,237 --> 01:41:58,114
They'll fucking kill me!

1629
01:41:58,363 --> 01:42:00,001
I'll fucking die!

1630
01:42:04,367 --> 01:42:05,720
Son of a bitch!

1631
01:42:05,868 --> 01:42:07,347
It's all right.

1632
01:42:09,287 --> 01:42:11,039
I don't know what happened.

1633
01:42:11,872 --> 01:42:12,987
Fuck!

1634
01:42:19,711 --> 01:42:21,861
All I wanted in the world...

1635
01:42:24,214 --> 01:42:26,284
...was to be a Catholic priest.

1636
01:42:27,549 --> 01:42:29,141
Live in a monastery.

1637
01:42:29,384 --> 01:42:30,703
Pray. Serve God.

1638
01:42:32,428 --> 01:42:33,543
I had...

1639
01:42:36,014 --> 01:42:38,403
...one terrible fucking weakness.

1640
01:42:39,266 --> 01:42:40,984
And they defrocked me!

1641
01:42:45,270 --> 01:42:47,625
Then I started to lose everything.

1642
01:42:49,648 --> 01:42:51,161
You'll be okay, Dave.

1643
01:42:51,524 --> 01:42:54,482
Just talk to us on the record.
We'll protect you.

1644
01:43:00,905 --> 01:43:02,623
They'll get to you too.

1645
01:43:04,116 --> 01:43:05,595
They'll destroy you.

1646
01:43:07,577 --> 01:43:09,056
They're untouchable.

1647
01:43:12,747 --> 01:43:15,784
I'm so fucking exhausted,
I can't see straight.

1648
01:43:31,041 --> 01:43:32,838
Early for Mardi Gras, isn't it?

1649
01:43:33,001 --> 01:43:35,561
Paris Match,
the largest magazine in France.

1650
01:43:36,544 --> 01:43:38,535
Literaturnaya Gazeta from Moscow.

1651
01:43:38,713 --> 01:43:40,669
Victoria Taylor, Private Eye.

1652
01:43:41,714 --> 01:43:44,626
You know who shot the President?
Mr. Garrison is too busy...

1653
01:43:44,842 --> 01:43:47,310
They're putting the heat on David Ferrie.

1654
01:43:48,136 --> 01:43:50,445
If we wait, he won't hold on.

1655
01:43:52,514 --> 01:43:56,427
He keeps changing his story.
We can't call him to a grand jury.

1656
01:43:57,684 --> 01:44:01,802
He'll keep deteriorating.
We'll get more out of him when he cracks.

1657
01:44:03,062 --> 01:44:06,691
If we call him in now he might freeze up,
we'll lose our best shot.

1658
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:10,955
He can't go down any further.
We must protect him full time.

1659
01:44:12,152 --> 01:44:14,712
I know what you're going through
with Ferrie.

1660
01:44:15,154 --> 01:44:19,227
We'll talk tomorrow.
I have to catch a plane to Washington.

1661
01:44:21,242 --> 01:44:24,518
A lead says he's closely connected
to these events...

1662
01:44:24,994 --> 01:44:26,473
...but he won't come here.

1663
01:44:26,620 --> 01:44:29,612
I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster,
Eladio del Valle.

1664
01:44:30,165 --> 01:44:32,804
I need more men. I got to get him in.

1665
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,197
I can't pull the teams to watch Ferrie.
I promised him!

1666
01:44:36,502 --> 01:44:38,140
This is our case!

1667
01:44:41,547 --> 01:44:43,378
I got something to show you.

1668
01:44:43,798 --> 01:44:46,266
I think you'll find it interesting.

1669
01:44:49,136 --> 01:44:50,888
This was found in your office.

1670
01:44:51,053 --> 01:44:54,728
The conference room is bugged, maybe
the phones. We have to debug the place.

1671
01:44:54,973 --> 01:44:57,851
Bugging the DA's office.
This is outrageous!

1672
01:44:59,518 --> 01:45:01,986
Believe what you want,
but we must be more careful.

1673
01:45:02,186 --> 01:45:04,177
All these new volunteers!

1674
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:09,075
You handle it, okay?
I don't have time for this nonsense.

1675
01:45:11,651 --> 01:45:14,768
Well, we obviously got
the bastards worried now.

1676
01:45:17,822 --> 01:45:19,813
I'm coming to Washington!

1677
01:45:25,410 --> 01:45:27,128
Dave Ferrie's dead.

1678
01:45:27,829 --> 01:45:30,389
Found his body in his apartment
two hours ago.

1679
01:45:55,806 --> 01:45:57,125
What's it look like?

1680
01:45:57,265 --> 01:46:01,736
I don't see any violence. Heart attack,
maybe an aneurysm. Natural causes.

1681
01:46:02,018 --> 01:46:04,737
This is addressed to no one
and no signature.

1682
01:46:05,145 --> 01:46:07,898
"To leave this life is
for me a sweet prospect.

1683
01:46:08,315 --> 01:46:10,590
"I find nothing in it that is desirable...

1684
01:46:10,775 --> 01:46:13,892
"...and, on the other hand,
everything that is loathsome."

1685
01:46:14,110 --> 01:46:15,748
It goes on and on.

1686
01:46:16,111 --> 01:46:20,263
"Daily we are propagandized more
and more by the rising crime wave."

1687
01:46:21,031 --> 01:46:23,420
Seems pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.

1688
01:46:44,547 --> 01:46:45,536
Proloid.

1689
01:46:48,175 --> 01:46:50,928
I took it once for a low thyroid condition.

1690
01:46:51,761 --> 01:46:53,592
It raises the metabolism.

1691
01:46:55,179 --> 01:46:58,569
Ferrie strike you as the kind of person
with a low metabolism?

1692
01:46:58,807 --> 01:47:01,958
Hardly, I'd say the opposite.
Maybe hypertension.

1693
01:47:02,810 --> 01:47:07,440
Ferrie was the only one to express
any kind of remorse about the whole thing.

1694
01:47:09,231 --> 01:47:10,949
I think it got him killed.

1695
01:47:13,025 --> 01:47:14,663
More bad news from Miami.

1696
01:47:14,943 --> 01:47:17,582
Ferrie's friend, Eladio del Valle,
was found...

1697
01:47:18,654 --> 01:47:21,043
...hacked to death with a machete
in his car.

1698
01:47:21,239 --> 01:47:25,994
He was tortured, shot point-blank
in the heart, his skull split open with an ax.

1699
01:47:26,368 --> 01:47:28,086
Ain't that the devil's piss!

1700
01:47:28,244 --> 01:47:31,316
Found another note. Same thing.
No name. No signature.

1701
01:47:31,788 --> 01:47:36,020
"When you receive this, I'll be quite dead,
so no answer is possible.

1702
01:47:36,666 --> 01:47:41,182
- "I offered you love, I got kicked."
- Must've pressed to come up with that.

1703
01:47:43,630 --> 01:47:48,067
What if a man with hypertension
were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?

1704
01:47:48,716 --> 01:47:53,153
He'd die quickly. A heart storm
or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.

1705
01:47:54,053 --> 01:47:56,931
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid
in his system?

1706
01:47:57,222 --> 01:47:58,940
Not with a routine autopsy.

1707
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:02,457
But there may be a high level of iodine
in the spinal fluid.

1708
01:48:02,684 --> 01:48:05,562
But it's difficult to know.
What're you thinking?

1709
01:48:07,771 --> 01:48:11,081
It doesn't make sense.
Would a man afraid of dying...

1710
01:48:11,649 --> 01:48:14,288
...kill himself in a way that leaves no trace?

1711
01:48:15,568 --> 01:48:17,957
And leave two unsigned suicide notes?

1712
01:48:18,695 --> 01:48:21,289
If it's a suicide, I've seen weirder.

1713
01:48:22,281 --> 01:48:25,239
The fact is, he's gone. And so is our case.

1714
01:48:25,532 --> 01:48:27,011
Unless we go for Shaw now.

1715
01:48:27,159 --> 01:48:30,310
With whose testimony?
O'Keefe, a male prostitute?

1716
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:33,998
Jack Martin, a drunk?
Vernon Bundy, a dope fiend?

1717
01:48:34,247 --> 01:48:37,956
Shaw's got respect. Newspaper editors,
American Bar Association.

1718
01:48:38,208 --> 01:48:41,644
- I agree. We don't have the goods.
- We wait, Shaw will get whacked!

1719
01:48:41,877 --> 01:48:44,675
How many corpses do you need
to figure out what's going on?

1720
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:47,394
Watch your mouth! Ferrie did this himself.

1721
01:48:48,548 --> 01:48:49,947
Where're you going?

1722
01:48:50,092 --> 01:48:51,366
I don't know.

1723
01:48:51,634 --> 01:48:53,272
I just don't know.

1724
01:48:58,597 --> 01:49:01,031
Frank, you're wasting your time here.

1725
01:49:01,223 --> 01:49:03,498
Big Jim gave strict orders. No FBI.

1726
01:49:03,893 --> 01:49:05,485
It's you I want to talk to.

1727
01:49:05,643 --> 01:49:08,157
Boss'd fry me in hog fat
if he knew I talked to you.

1728
01:49:08,353 --> 01:49:10,662
Boss's got a problem. Real serious.

1729
01:49:11,106 --> 01:49:14,257
- We know what's going on at your office.
- I guess you do.

1730
01:49:14,525 --> 01:49:18,313
You got nothing. I'm a friend.
You're riding on the Titanic.

1731
01:49:18,736 --> 01:49:21,375
Time to jump off
before you get destroyed, too.

1732
01:49:21,946 --> 01:49:22,901
Enough!

1733
01:49:23,031 --> 01:49:26,023
We're talking about your career.
You're young.

1734
01:49:27,075 --> 01:49:28,827
You're working the Castro thing.

1735
01:49:28,993 --> 01:49:30,426
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

1736
01:49:30,577 --> 01:49:33,887
We know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.
Castro did.

1737
01:49:34,621 --> 01:49:36,612
If it comes out, there'll be a war.

1738
01:49:36,789 --> 01:49:41,021
Millions of people will die.
That's more important than Jim Garrison.

1739
01:49:41,459 --> 01:49:44,451
Look at me when I talk to you!
You're too selfish!

1740
01:49:44,879 --> 01:49:46,107
Shut up!

1741
01:49:46,755 --> 01:49:50,794
If you got a brain in your thick skull,
listen to me. Listen real hard.

1742
01:49:52,134 --> 01:49:53,362
Get in the car.

1743
01:50:15,358 --> 01:50:16,552
Garrison?

1744
01:50:17,818 --> 01:50:18,648
Yes.

1745
01:50:19,902 --> 01:50:21,176
Glad you came.

1746
01:50:21,653 --> 01:50:23,484
Sorry about the precautions.

1747
01:50:23,655 --> 01:50:26,044
I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...?

1748
01:50:27,325 --> 01:50:30,920
I could give you a false name,
but I won't. Call me "X."

1749
01:50:32,620 --> 01:50:36,898
I've already been warned by the Agency,
so, if this is another threat...

1750
01:50:37,665 --> 01:50:39,895
I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison.

1751
01:50:40,875 --> 01:50:44,504
If you've come this far,
what I have to say interests you.

1752
01:50:44,836 --> 01:50:47,873
I won't name names or tell you who
or what I represent.

1753
01:50:48,798 --> 01:50:50,516
Except to say you're close.

1754
01:50:51,924 --> 01:50:53,516
Closer than you think.

1755
01:50:57,303 --> 01:51:00,295
Everything I'll say is classified top secret.

1756
01:51:00,931 --> 01:51:03,729
I was a soldier, Mr. Garrison. Two wars.

1757
01:51:04,933 --> 01:51:08,687
A secret Pentagon guy,
supplying the hardware:

1758
01:51:08,936 --> 01:51:10,688
Planes, bullets, rifles...

1759
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:13,413
...for what we call "Black Operations."

1760
01:51:13,939 --> 01:51:16,328
Black Ops. Assassinations. Coups d'tat...

1761
01:51:16,524 --> 01:51:19,243
...rigging elections,
propaganda, psych warfare.

1762
01:51:20,486 --> 01:51:23,922
In World War II, I was in Romania,
Greece, Yugoslavia.

1763
01:51:24,447 --> 01:51:28,520
I helped evacuate part of Nazi intelligence
at the end of the war.

1764
01:51:29,117 --> 01:51:31,711
And we used those guys
against the Communists.

1765
01:51:32,202 --> 01:51:34,432
In Italy, '48, we stole the elections.

1766
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:36,929
France '49, we broke the strikes.

1767
01:51:37,414 --> 01:51:40,292
Overthrew Quirino in the Philippines,
Arbenz in Guatemala...

1768
01:51:40,499 --> 01:51:43,297
...Mossadegh in Iran.
We were in Vietnam in '54...

1769
01:51:44,085 --> 01:51:46,201
...Indonesia, '58, Tibet, '59.

1770
01:51:46,878 --> 01:51:50,109
Got the Dalai Lama out. We were good.

1771
01:51:51,382 --> 01:51:52,656
Very good.

1772
01:51:53,675 --> 01:51:56,269
Then we got into the Cuban thing.
Not so good.

1773
01:51:56,552 --> 01:51:59,703
Set up an invasion to take place
in October, '62.

1774
01:52:00,513 --> 01:52:03,710
Khrushchev sent missiles to resist.
Kennedy didn't invade.

1775
01:52:04,432 --> 01:52:06,866
We just had our dicks in the wind.

1776
01:52:07,058 --> 01:52:09,492
A lot of pissed-off people, Mr. Garrison.

1777
01:52:10,228 --> 01:52:11,343
Understand?

1778
01:52:11,937 --> 01:52:13,575
I'll come to that later.

1779
01:52:14,063 --> 01:52:15,860
So, 1963...

1780
01:52:17,024 --> 01:52:19,492
I spent much of September of '63...

1781
01:52:20,068 --> 01:52:22,901
...working on the Kennedy plan
to get all US personnel...

1782
01:52:23,111 --> 01:52:25,705
...out of Vietnam by the end of 1965.

1783
01:52:26,406 --> 01:52:30,001
One of the strongest plans issued
by the Kennedy White House...

1784
01:52:31,076 --> 01:52:33,226
...National Security Memo 263...

1785
01:52:33,619 --> 01:52:35,735
...ordered home the first 1,000 troops.

1786
01:52:36,704 --> 01:52:40,902
But in November, a week after the murder
of Vietnamese President Diem...

1787
01:52:41,166 --> 01:52:43,726
...and two weeks before
Kennedy's assassination...

1788
01:52:43,917 --> 01:52:46,192
...a strange thing happened to me.

1789
01:52:48,754 --> 01:52:50,392
Is Dave in there?

1790
01:52:55,467 --> 01:52:57,378
You wanted to see me, General?

1791
01:52:57,844 --> 01:52:59,038
I do, indeed.

1792
01:52:59,511 --> 01:53:01,467
You're going to the South Pole.

1793
01:53:02,222 --> 01:53:03,177
I am?

1794
01:53:04,014 --> 01:53:05,686
Dr. Mooney's got the details.

1795
01:53:05,849 --> 01:53:08,488
Check with him. Have a nice vacation.

1796
01:53:09,268 --> 01:53:12,101
I was sent by my superior,
we'll call him "Y"...

1797
01:53:12,645 --> 01:53:15,239
...I was sent by General Y
to the South Pole...

1798
01:53:16,064 --> 01:53:19,579
...as military escort for a group
of international VIPs.

1799
01:53:20,233 --> 01:53:22,906
I was on my way back, in New Zealand...

1800
01:53:23,861 --> 01:53:25,738
...when the President was killed.

1801
01:53:27,863 --> 01:53:31,139
Oswald was charged at 7:00 p.m.,
Dallas time...

1802
01:53:31,783 --> 01:53:35,901
...with Tippit's murder. That's 2:00 p.m.
The next day in New Zealand.

1803
01:53:36,911 --> 01:53:39,709
But already their papers
had the entire history...

1804
01:53:39,913 --> 01:53:42,473
...of this unknown, 24-year-old Oswald.

1805
01:53:42,999 --> 01:53:46,116
Studio picture, detailed biography,
Russian information...

1806
01:53:46,335 --> 01:53:49,247
...and were sure that he killed
the President alone...

1807
01:53:49,461 --> 01:53:53,579
...although it took them four more hours
to charge him with that crime in Dallas.

1808
01:53:56,174 --> 01:53:57,766
It felt to me as if...

1809
01:53:59,093 --> 01:54:01,209
...a cover story was being put out.

1810
01:54:01,512 --> 01:54:03,343
Like we would in a Black Op.

1811
01:54:05,223 --> 01:54:06,702
After I came back...

1812
01:54:06,974 --> 01:54:10,364
...I asked myself, why was I,
the chief of Special Ops...

1813
01:54:10,684 --> 01:54:13,403
...sent to the South Pole to do a job...

1814
01:54:13,979 --> 01:54:15,810
...many others could have done?

1815
01:54:15,980 --> 01:54:18,050
I wondered if it could've been because...

1816
01:54:18,232 --> 01:54:20,666
...a routine duty,
if I'd been in Washington...

1817
01:54:20,859 --> 01:54:23,532
...would've been to order
additional security in Texas.

1818
01:54:23,735 --> 01:54:27,125
I checked it out and found that someone...

1819
01:54:27,362 --> 01:54:31,913
...told the 112th Military Intelligence Group
at Fort Sam Houston...

1820
01:54:32,324 --> 01:54:36,078
...to stand down that day,
over the protests of Colonel Reich.

1821
01:54:37,245 --> 01:54:38,917
I believe it's a mistake.

1822
01:54:39,204 --> 01:54:44,119
It's standard procedure, especially
in a known hostile city like Dallas...

1823
01:54:44,458 --> 01:54:46,494
...to supplement the Secret Service.

1824
01:54:46,667 --> 01:54:49,818
Even if we hadn't let him ride
with the bubble-top off...

1825
01:54:50,462 --> 01:54:54,250
...we would've put 100 to 200 agents
on the sidewalk without question.

1826
01:54:55,007 --> 01:54:59,159
A month before, in Dallas, UN Ambassador
Adlai Stevenson was spit on and hit.

1827
01:54:59,510 --> 01:55:02,308
There had been attempts
on De Gaulle's life in France.

1828
01:55:02,511 --> 01:55:05,184
We'd have arrived days ahead,
studied the route...

1829
01:55:05,388 --> 01:55:06,787
...checked all buildings.

1830
01:55:06,931 --> 01:55:09,809
Never would've allowed open windows
overlooking Dealey.

1831
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:12,136
Our own snipers
would've covered the area.

1832
01:55:12,351 --> 01:55:14,819
If a window went up,
they'd have been on the radio!

1833
01:55:15,020 --> 01:55:18,251
We'd be watching the crowd:
Packages, rolled-up newspapers, coats.

1834
01:55:18,481 --> 01:55:20,711
Never would've let a man
open an umbrella.

1835
01:55:20,983 --> 01:55:23,736
Never would've let the car slow down
to ten miles an hour.

1836
01:55:23,943 --> 01:55:26,582
Or take that unusual curve
at Houston and Elm.

1837
01:55:27,321 --> 01:55:30,472
You'd have felt an Army presence
in the streets that day.

1838
01:55:30,864 --> 01:55:35,255
But none of this happened. It violated
our most basic protection codes.

1839
01:55:35,868 --> 01:55:39,497
And it is the best indication
of a massive plot in Dallas.

1840
01:55:40,996 --> 01:55:42,907
Who could have best done this?

1841
01:55:43,164 --> 01:55:48,238
Black Ops. People in my business.
My superior might call Col. Reich and say:

1842
01:55:48,584 --> 01:55:52,418
"We have another unit coming for security.
You'll stand down."

1843
01:55:53,463 --> 01:55:56,500
That day, some Army intelligence people
were in Dallas.

1844
01:55:56,965 --> 01:55:58,557
I don't know who or why.

1845
01:55:59,092 --> 01:56:00,844
But they weren't protecting clients.

1846
01:56:01,010 --> 01:56:04,161
And Oswald. Army Intell had
a Lee Harvey Oswald on file.

1847
01:56:05,930 --> 01:56:07,966
Those files have been destroyed.

1848
01:56:08,390 --> 01:56:12,702
Many strange things were happening.
Oswald had nothing to do with them.

1849
01:56:14,853 --> 01:56:17,162
The entire Cabinet was in the Far East.

1850
01:56:17,355 --> 01:56:20,392
A third of a combat division
was returning from Germany...

1851
01:56:20,607 --> 01:56:24,236
...in the air above the United States,
at the time of the shooting.

1852
01:56:24,568 --> 01:56:29,517
At 12:34 p.m., the Washington
telephone system went out for an hour.

1853
01:56:30,155 --> 01:56:32,111
On the plane back to Washington...

1854
01:56:32,281 --> 01:56:34,511
...word was radioed
from the Situations Room...

1855
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:39,012
...to Johnson that there was one assassin.
Sound like coincidences to you?

1856
01:56:40,870 --> 01:56:42,303
Not for one moment.

1857
01:56:42,955 --> 01:56:45,230
The Cabinet was out of the way.

1858
01:56:46,291 --> 01:56:48,327
Troops for riot control were in the air.

1859
01:56:48,501 --> 01:56:51,857
Telephones were out to stop
the wrong stories from spreading.

1860
01:56:52,711 --> 01:56:54,190
Nothing was left to chance.

1861
01:56:54,671 --> 01:56:57,344
He could not be allowed to escape alive.

1862
01:57:00,592 --> 01:57:02,867
Things were never the same after that.

1863
01:57:04,428 --> 01:57:07,147
Vietnam started for real.
There was an air of...

1864
01:57:08,472 --> 01:57:10,702
...make-believe in the Pentagon and CIA.

1865
01:57:10,891 --> 01:57:14,884
Those of us in Secret Ops knew
the Warren Commission was fiction.

1866
01:57:15,727 --> 01:57:17,445
But there was something...

1867
01:57:17,812 --> 01:57:18,961
...deeper.

1868
01:57:19,355 --> 01:57:20,265
Uglier.

1869
01:57:20,522 --> 01:57:23,673
I knew Allen Dulles well.
I often briefed him in his house.

1870
01:57:23,900 --> 01:57:28,928
But why was he appointed to investigate
Kennedy's death? The man who fired him.

1871
01:57:29,779 --> 01:57:32,816
Dulles, by the way,
was General Y's benefactor.

1872
01:57:35,115 --> 01:57:36,753
I got out in '64.

1873
01:57:37,659 --> 01:57:39,297
Resigned my commission.

1874
01:57:41,037 --> 01:57:44,507
I never realized Kennedy was so dangerous
to the establishment.

1875
01:57:45,748 --> 01:57:47,147
Is that why?

1876
01:57:47,708 --> 01:57:50,268
That's the real question, isn't it? Why?

1877
01:57:50,835 --> 01:57:54,111
The how and the who is just scenery
for the public.

1878
01:57:55,088 --> 01:57:57,807
Oswald, Ruby, Cuba, the Mafia...

1879
01:57:58,548 --> 01:58:00,425
...keeps them guessing, like a game.

1880
01:58:00,591 --> 01:58:03,663
Prevents them from asking
the most important question: Why?

1881
01:58:03,885 --> 01:58:06,558
Why was Kennedy killed? Who benefited?

1882
01:58:07,096 --> 01:58:10,168
Who has the power to cover it up? Who?

1883
01:58:13,892 --> 01:58:15,166
In 1961...

1884
01:58:16,811 --> 01:58:20,247
...right after the Bay of Pigs,
very few people know this...

1885
01:58:20,813 --> 01:58:25,284
...I participated in drawing up
National Security Action Memos 55, 56, 57.

1886
01:58:25,901 --> 01:58:28,620
These are documents classified top secret.

1887
01:58:29,236 --> 01:58:32,911
In them, Kennedy told Gen. Lemnitzer,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs...

1888
01:58:33,155 --> 01:58:37,068
...that from here on, the Joint Chiefs
would be wholly responsible...

1889
01:58:37,408 --> 01:58:40,286
...for all covert paramilitary action
in peacetime.

1890
01:58:40,994 --> 01:58:42,985
This ended the reign of the CIA.

1891
01:58:43,579 --> 01:58:46,935
Splintered it into 1,000 pieces,
as JFK promised he would.

1892
01:58:47,332 --> 01:58:49,482
And now he was ordering the military...

1893
01:58:49,667 --> 01:58:51,897
...to help him do it. Unprecedented!

1894
01:58:52,085 --> 01:58:56,476
I can't tell you the shock waves this sent
along the corridors of power.

1895
01:58:56,922 --> 01:58:58,913
This and the firing of Allen Dulles...

1896
01:58:59,089 --> 01:59:01,398
...Richard Bissell and Gen. Charles Cabell.

1897
01:59:01,592 --> 01:59:04,789
All were sacred cows in Intell
since World War II.

1898
01:59:05,385 --> 01:59:07,455
They got some very upset people.

1899
01:59:08,595 --> 01:59:11,473
Kennedy's directives weren't implemented
because of...

1900
01:59:11,682 --> 01:59:13,752
...bureaucratic resistance.

1901
01:59:14,683 --> 01:59:16,560
But one of the results was...

1902
01:59:16,977 --> 01:59:20,367
...the Cuban operation was turned over
to my department...

1903
01:59:21,188 --> 01:59:23,179
...as Operation Mongoose.

1904
01:59:23,731 --> 01:59:25,881
Mongoose was pure Black Ops.

1905
01:59:26,358 --> 01:59:29,316
It was secretly based at Miami University...

1906
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:32,579
...which has the largest
domestic CIA station...

1907
01:59:33,029 --> 01:59:35,941
...budgeted annually for hundreds
of millions of dollars.

1908
01:59:36,156 --> 01:59:38,624
Three hundred agents, 7,000 select Cubans.

1909
01:59:39,575 --> 01:59:42,135
Fifty fake business fronts
to launder money.

1910
01:59:42,453 --> 01:59:44,921
They waged a non-stop war against Castro.

1911
01:59:45,329 --> 01:59:47,638
Industrial sabotage, crop burning, etc.

1912
01:59:48,206 --> 01:59:50,242
All under the control of General Y.

1913
01:59:51,125 --> 01:59:53,719
He took the rules of covert warfare
he'd used abroad...

1914
01:59:53,919 --> 01:59:55,716
...and brought them to this country.

1915
01:59:55,878 --> 01:59:58,517
Now he had the people,
the equipment, the bases...

1916
01:59:58,714 --> 02:00:00,272
...and the motivation.

1917
02:00:00,548 --> 02:00:04,700
Don't underestimate the budget cuts
that Kennedy called for in March of 1963.

1918
02:00:05,301 --> 02:00:07,940
Nearly 52 military installations
in 25 states.

1919
02:00:08,387 --> 02:00:10,059
Twenty-one overseas bases.

1920
02:00:10,722 --> 02:00:12,041
Big money.

1921
02:00:12,347 --> 02:00:15,419
You know how many helicopters
have been lost in Vietnam?

1922
02:00:16,517 --> 02:00:18,269
Nearly 3,000 so far.

1923
02:00:19,311 --> 02:00:22,348
Who makes them?
Bell Helicopter. Who owns Bell?

1924
02:00:22,730 --> 02:00:26,325
Bell was nearly bankrupt when First
National Bank of Boston asked the CIA...

1925
02:00:26,565 --> 02:00:30,478
...to use the helicopter in Indochina.
How about the F-111 fighter?

1926
02:00:31,152 --> 02:00:34,189
General Dynamics of Fort Worth, Texas.
Who owns that?

1927
02:00:34,405 --> 02:00:38,921
Find out the defense budget since
the war began. $75 going on $100 billion.

1928
02:00:39,450 --> 02:00:42,328
Nearly $200 billion will be spent
before it's over.

1929
02:00:42,827 --> 02:00:44,738
In 1949, it was $10 billion.

1930
02:00:45,078 --> 02:00:46,750
No war... no money.

1931
02:00:47,913 --> 02:00:51,383
The organizing principle
of any society, Mr. Garrison...

1932
02:00:51,625 --> 02:00:53,058
...is for war.

1933
02:00:53,459 --> 02:00:57,293
The authority of the state over its people
resides in its war powers.

1934
02:00:57,920 --> 02:01:00,798
Kennedy wanted to end the Cold War
in his second term.

1935
02:01:01,006 --> 02:01:04,316
He wanted to call off the moon race
and cooperate with the Soviets.

1936
02:01:04,550 --> 02:01:07,018
He signed a treaty to ban nuclear testing.

1937
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:09,694
He refused to invade Cuba in 1962.

1938
02:01:10,096 --> 02:01:12,405
He set out to withdraw from Vietnam.

1939
02:01:13,973 --> 02:01:17,602
But all that ended
on the 22nd of November, 1963.

1940
02:01:18,726 --> 02:01:22,958
Since 1961, they knew Kennedy
was not going to war in Southeast Asia.

1941
02:01:23,479 --> 02:01:25,913
Like Caesar, he is surrounded by enemies.

1942
02:01:26,106 --> 02:01:30,418
Something's underway, but it has no face.
Yet, everybody in the loop knows.

1943
02:01:30,776 --> 02:01:32,528
Forget about combat troops.

1944
02:01:32,694 --> 02:01:36,209
He told McNamara he would pull out
the goddamn advisors!

1945
02:01:37,739 --> 02:01:41,652
He fucked us in Laos and now
he will fuck us in Vietnam!

1946
02:01:42,284 --> 02:01:45,242
He can't afford to implement it
before the election.

1947
02:01:45,536 --> 02:01:47,766
I hear the NSC meeting
was a real barn burner.

1948
02:01:47,954 --> 02:01:52,425
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
Heads will roll. Hear about Lemnitzer?

1949
02:01:52,958 --> 02:01:53,788
What?

1950
02:01:53,917 --> 02:01:55,987
Kennedy rubbed Lem's nose in shit.

1951
02:01:56,294 --> 02:01:59,013
Said if we didn't go into Cuba,
which was so close...

1952
02:01:59,212 --> 02:02:01,851
...why go into Vietnam
which is so far away?

1953
02:02:02,255 --> 02:02:03,734
There he goes again.

1954
02:02:03,882 --> 02:02:05,952
Got his hand on the chicken switch.

1955
02:02:06,258 --> 02:02:09,534
Lem said that the Chiefs still think
we should go into Cuba.

1956
02:02:09,761 --> 02:02:10,876
Money's at stake.

1957
02:02:11,012 --> 02:02:13,003
Big money. $100 billion.

1958
02:02:14,431 --> 02:02:17,184
Kennedy bred voting districts
for defense dollars.

1959
02:02:17,391 --> 02:02:21,543
He gave TFX fighter contracts only
to those counties that will matter in '64.

1960
02:02:22,061 --> 02:02:24,700
The people in the loop fight back.
Their way.

1961
02:02:25,313 --> 02:02:27,668
We have to control the intelligence
from Saigon.

1962
02:02:27,856 --> 02:02:31,371
We just don't let McNamara
stick his nose in this thing!

1963
02:02:32,026 --> 02:02:35,780
Every time he goes over to Saigon
for a fact-finding mission...

1964
02:02:36,154 --> 02:02:39,032
...he comes back
and scares the shit out of Kennedy!

1965
02:02:39,406 --> 02:02:40,919
Now I want Max Taylor
on him night and day...

1966
02:02:41,741 --> 02:02:43,572
...like a fly on shit.

1967
02:02:44,368 --> 02:02:48,441
You control McNamara,
you control Kennedy.

1968
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:50,262
I think it started like that.

1969
02:02:50,414 --> 02:02:51,767
In the wind.

1970
02:02:51,998 --> 02:02:55,308
Defense contractors, oil bankers.
Just conversation.

1971
02:02:56,084 --> 02:02:59,554
A call is made. Maybe to someone
like my superior officer General Y.

1972
02:03:01,296 --> 02:03:03,605
We're going. We need your help.

1973
02:03:04,089 --> 02:03:05,124
When?

1974
02:03:05,716 --> 02:03:08,230
In the fall. Probably in the South.

1975
02:03:08,717 --> 02:03:11,470
- We want you to come up with a plan.
- I can do that.

1976
02:03:11,679 --> 02:03:13,237
Everything is cellularized.

1977
02:03:13,387 --> 02:03:16,823
No one said, "He must die." No vote.
Nothing's on paper.

1978
02:03:17,515 --> 02:03:19,153
There's no one to blame.

1979
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:21,750
It's as old as the crucifixion.

1980
02:03:22,185 --> 02:03:24,016
Or the military firing squad.

1981
02:03:24,395 --> 02:03:27,228
Five bullets, one blank. No one's guilty.

1982
02:03:27,939 --> 02:03:29,975
Everybody in the power structure...

1983
02:03:30,149 --> 02:03:31,946
...has a plausible deniability.

1984
02:03:32,109 --> 02:03:35,579
No compromising connections
except at the most secret point.

1985
02:03:37,154 --> 02:03:38,906
But it must succeed.

1986
02:03:39,072 --> 02:03:41,666
No matter how many die
or how much it costs...

1987
02:03:41,865 --> 02:03:44,538
...the perpetrators must be
on the winning side...

1988
02:03:44,742 --> 02:03:48,417
...and never subject to prosecution
for anything by anyone.

1989
02:03:49,078 --> 02:03:50,909
That is a coup d'tat.

1990
02:03:55,125 --> 02:03:57,878
Kennedy announces
the Texas trip in September.

1991
02:03:58,085 --> 02:04:01,157
At that moment,
second Oswalds pop up all over Dallas...

1992
02:04:01,754 --> 02:04:04,507
...where they have the mayor
and the cops in their pocket.

1993
02:04:04,714 --> 02:04:06,784
General Y flies in the assassins.

1994
02:04:07,008 --> 02:04:10,523
Maybe from the special camp
we keep near Athens, Greece.

1995
02:04:10,843 --> 02:04:11,719
Pros.

1996
02:04:12,011 --> 02:04:15,367
Maybe be locals, Cubans, Mafia hire.
Separate teams.

1997
02:04:15,889 --> 02:04:17,607
Does it matter who shot...

1998
02:04:18,307 --> 02:04:19,899
...from what rooftop?

1999
02:04:21,309 --> 02:04:22,901
Part of the scenery.

2000
02:04:23,561 --> 02:04:25,950
I keep thinking about that Tuesday...

2001
02:04:26,312 --> 02:04:27,745
...the 26th of November.

2002
02:04:27,897 --> 02:04:29,649
The day after they buried Kennedy.

2003
02:04:29,814 --> 02:04:33,489
Gentlemen, I am not going
to let Vietnam go like China did.

2004
02:04:34,442 --> 02:04:35,795
I'm committed...

2005
02:04:35,986 --> 02:04:40,298
...not to take our soldiers out of there
till they know we mean business in Asia.

2006
02:04:40,947 --> 02:04:44,144
Lyndon Johnson signs
National Security Memo 273...

2007
02:04:44,450 --> 02:04:46,964
...which reverses
Kennedy's withdrawal policy...

2008
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:49,833
...and approves covert action
against North Vietnam...

2009
02:04:50,037 --> 02:04:52,073
...provoking the Gulf of Tonkin incident.

2010
02:04:52,247 --> 02:04:55,364
Just get me elected,
I'll give you the damn war.

2011
02:04:57,292 --> 02:04:58,771
In that document...

2012
02:05:00,085 --> 02:05:01,677
...lay the Vietnam War.

2013
02:05:07,173 --> 02:05:10,802
I can't believe they killed him
because he wanted to change things.

2014
02:05:12,177 --> 02:05:15,453
- In our time, in our country!
- They've done it throughout history.

2015
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:18,956
Kings are killed. Politics is power,
nothing more!

2016
02:05:20,099 --> 02:05:23,216
Don't take my word for it.
Do your own thinking.

2017
02:05:26,020 --> 02:05:27,533
The size of this is...

2018
02:05:28,438 --> 02:05:29,712
...beyond me.

2019
02:05:30,314 --> 02:05:31,542
Testify.

2020
02:05:31,690 --> 02:05:33,123
- Me?
- Testify.

2021
02:05:34,776 --> 02:05:36,289
No chance in hell.

2022
02:05:37,111 --> 02:05:40,899
No, I'd be arrested and gagged.
Maybe sent to an institution.

2023
02:05:41,614 --> 02:05:42,967
Maybe worse. You too.

2024
02:05:43,781 --> 02:05:47,774
I can give you the background.
You find the foreground, the little things.

2025
02:05:48,034 --> 02:05:51,549
Dig, you're the only one to bring a trial
in Kennedy's murder.

2026
02:05:51,954 --> 02:05:54,184
That's important. It's historic.

2027
02:05:54,956 --> 02:05:56,389
I haven't yet.

2028
02:05:57,207 --> 02:05:59,357
I don't have much of a case.

2029
02:06:00,543 --> 02:06:02,534
You don't have a choice anymore.

2030
02:06:02,878 --> 02:06:06,393
You're a significant threat
to the national security structure.

2031
02:06:06,964 --> 02:06:09,842
They'd have killed you already,
but there's light on you.

2032
02:06:10,049 --> 02:06:12,119
So they'll destroy your credibility.

2033
02:06:12,301 --> 02:06:14,371
They already have in many circles.

2034
02:06:14,802 --> 02:06:15,996
Be honest.

2035
02:06:16,387 --> 02:06:20,460
Your only chance is to come up
with a case. Something. Anything.

2036
02:06:21,182 --> 02:06:23,616
Make arrests. Stir the shitstorm.

2037
02:06:24,477 --> 02:06:26,069
Hope to start...

2038
02:06:26,477 --> 02:06:29,037
...a chain reaction
of people coming forward.

2039
02:06:29,230 --> 02:06:31,141
Then the government will crack.

2040
02:06:31,314 --> 02:06:34,431
Fundamentally, people are suckers
for the truth.

2041
02:06:34,733 --> 02:06:36,963
And the truth is on your side, bubba.

2042
02:06:44,323 --> 02:06:45,836
I just hope you get a break.

2043
02:06:56,623 --> 02:06:58,978
JOHN FITZGERALD KENNED Y - 1917-1963

2044
02:07:31,314 --> 02:07:32,349
Mr. Shaw?

2045
02:07:33,189 --> 02:07:35,464
You are under arrest for conspiracy...

2046
02:07:35,859 --> 02:07:40,011
...and entering into agreement with others
for the purpose of murdering...

2047
02:07:40,361 --> 02:07:42,033
...President John F. Kennedy.

2048
02:07:42,196 --> 02:07:44,630
We have a warrant to search the premises.

2049
02:07:45,197 --> 02:07:47,074
It's my duty to inform you...

2050
02:07:47,783 --> 02:07:50,251
...you have the right to remain silent.

2051
02:07:50,535 --> 02:07:51,650
Name?

2052
02:07:52,119 --> 02:07:53,711
Clay La Verne Shaw.

2053
02:07:56,205 --> 02:07:57,240
Address?

2054
02:07:57,456 --> 02:07:59,890
1313 Dauphine Street, New Orleans.

2055
02:08:01,709 --> 02:08:03,506
Ever use any aliases?

2056
02:08:03,877 --> 02:08:05,356
Clay Bertrand.

2057
02:08:11,716 --> 02:08:15,789
Mr. Clark, are you aware of the charges
filed by District Attorney Garrison?

2058
02:08:16,052 --> 02:08:19,044
Yes, Mr. Shaw was included
in our investigation.

2059
02:08:19,680 --> 02:08:21,955
No connection was found at all.

2060
02:08:22,681 --> 02:08:26,071
If the FBI did investigate him,
why is his name not mentioned...

2061
02:08:26,309 --> 02:08:28,982
...in the entire 26 volumes
of the Warren Report...

2062
02:08:29,186 --> 02:08:31,416
...even if it is to clear his name?

2063
02:08:32,063 --> 02:08:35,658
I doubt this Attorney General
would qualify for my staff.

2064
02:08:36,024 --> 02:08:39,539
Mr. Garrison has presented
absolutely nothing publicly...

2065
02:08:40,319 --> 02:08:42,628
...which would contradict our findings.

2066
02:08:43,488 --> 02:08:46,525
I know of no fact which would refute...

2067
02:08:47,324 --> 02:08:49,394
...the Commission's conclusion...

2068
02:08:49,659 --> 02:08:52,332
...that Lee Oswald was the lone killer.

2069
02:08:54,954 --> 02:08:58,424
I congratulate Mr. Shaw.
Most defendants must wait for trial...

2070
02:08:58,664 --> 02:09:02,213
...before they produce sacred cows
like a Chief Justice...

2071
02:09:02,751 --> 02:09:04,150
...as a character witness...

2072
02:09:04,294 --> 02:09:07,491
...who is not under oath
and therefore free from perjury.

2073
02:09:08,004 --> 02:09:10,074
Even if it's partly true...

2074
02:09:10,506 --> 02:09:14,340
...you realize you're damaging
the credibility of the country?

2075
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:19,009
Is a government worth preserving
when it lies to the people?

2076
02:09:20,304 --> 02:09:22,181
It's become a dangerous country...

2077
02:09:22,347 --> 02:09:25,817
...when you cannot trust anyone.
When you cannot tell the truth.

2078
02:09:27,350 --> 02:09:30,422
I say let justice be done,
though the heavens fall!

2079
02:09:35,481 --> 02:09:36,675
SPECIAL REPORT

2080
02:09:36,815 --> 02:09:39,773
The JFK Conspiracy:
The Case of Jim Garrison.

2081
02:09:40,693 --> 02:09:44,288
- Honey, this is about you.
- After an investigation in New Orleans...

2082
02:09:44,529 --> 02:09:46,167
...reporters have learned...

2083
02:09:46,322 --> 02:09:49,394
...that District Attorney Jim Garrison
and his staff...

2084
02:09:49,699 --> 02:09:53,248
...have intimidated,
bribed and even drugged witnesses...

2085
02:09:53,493 --> 02:09:58,169
...to attempt to prove a conspiracy
involving businessman Clay Shaw...

2086
02:09:58,998 --> 02:10:01,148
...in the murder of John F. Kennedy.

2087
02:10:01,833 --> 02:10:05,508
John Chancler was a cellmate
of Willie O'Keefe's at Angola.

2088
02:10:06,377 --> 02:10:09,687
He said he'd be cut loose
if he copped to the DA's office.

2089
02:10:10,004 --> 02:10:11,835
I sent him up for burglary.

2090
02:10:13,216 --> 02:10:15,605
And there's his old buddy Miguel Torres.

2091
02:10:16,009 --> 02:10:17,488
We sent him up too.

2092
02:10:17,718 --> 02:10:21,677
They wanted me to say Shaw
was Bertrand. They'd get me a pardon.

2093
02:10:22,179 --> 02:10:25,057
Janet Williams comments
on Willie O'Keefe's...

2094
02:10:25,390 --> 02:10:27,779
...descriptions of having met Oswald.

2095
02:10:28,059 --> 02:10:29,617
Was he a homosexual?

2096
02:10:29,852 --> 02:10:32,002
Not the Lee I knew. Absolutely not.

2097
02:10:32,687 --> 02:10:36,077
Mr. O'Keefe must have seen someone
he thought was Lee Oswald.

2098
02:10:36,397 --> 02:10:39,912
I didn't talk to nobody.
I was on drugs at the hospital.

2099
02:10:40,692 --> 02:10:44,287
I told the FBI that call was a figment
of my imagination.

2100
02:10:44,695 --> 02:10:46,765
I think he's quite ill, mentally.

2101
02:10:47,030 --> 02:10:50,579
With one half of his mind,
he is able to fabricate evidence...

2102
02:10:51,742 --> 02:10:55,894
...then he convinces the other half
that the fabrication is the truth.

2103
02:10:56,495 --> 02:11:00,613
Don't worry. There's only 20
or 30 million people watching this tonight.

2104
02:11:03,041 --> 02:11:05,874
My reputation's all right
with the people watching Laugh In.

2105
02:11:06,085 --> 02:11:08,883
Has he ignored the Mafia connections
to this conspiracy...

2106
02:11:09,087 --> 02:11:12,045
...because he's indebted to the mob?

2107
02:11:12,714 --> 02:11:16,024
The more one looks at Jim Garrison,
the more one finds...

2108
02:11:16,341 --> 02:11:21,096
...he has destroyed reputations, spread fear
and suspicion, and worst of all...

2109
02:11:21,636 --> 02:11:24,548
...exploited this nation's sorrow and doubt.

2110
02:11:24,931 --> 02:11:26,762
Jim Garrison has said:

2111
02:11:27,766 --> 02:11:30,803
"Let justice be done,
though the heavens fall."

2112
02:11:31,393 --> 02:11:33,623
He seeks the truth. So do we.

2113
02:11:45,945 --> 02:11:49,540
Dr. Martin Luther King's beautiful dream
expressed so dramatically...

2114
02:11:49,781 --> 02:11:52,341
...during the 1963 march on Washington...

2115
02:11:52,533 --> 02:11:55,889
...was shattered tonight in Memphis,
Tennessee by an assassin's bullet.

2116
02:11:56,119 --> 02:11:59,191
Police think the single shot came
from across the street.

2117
02:11:59,412 --> 02:12:03,690
They found a Browning automatic rifle,
fitted with a marksman's scope.

2118
02:12:05,125 --> 02:12:06,524
I'll get it.

2119
02:12:09,252 --> 02:12:11,925
Hello, is this Jim Garrison's daughter?

2120
02:12:12,922 --> 02:12:14,753
Virginia or Elizabeth?

2121
02:12:16,257 --> 02:12:18,532
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl.

2122
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:22,793
Your daddy's entered you
in a beauty contest. Like to be in one?

2123
02:12:23,971 --> 02:12:25,199
I don't know.

2124
02:12:25,347 --> 02:12:27,577
My God! What have they done?

2125
02:12:28,891 --> 02:12:30,370
It's lynching time.

2126
02:12:33,269 --> 02:12:34,702
That sounds fun.

2127
02:12:35,478 --> 02:12:37,548
You get out of school at 3:00?

2128
02:12:37,813 --> 02:12:39,326
Who are you talking to?

2129
02:12:39,481 --> 02:12:41,233
That's all I need to know.

2130
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:44,233
Mommy, I'm going to be
in a beauty contest.

2131
02:12:44,610 --> 02:12:46,646
Who is this? Who is this?

2132
02:12:49,196 --> 02:12:51,790
Did you enter Virginia in a beauty contest?

2133
02:12:52,156 --> 02:12:54,795
A man called and asked her height,
her weight...

2134
02:12:54,993 --> 02:12:57,951
Some crackpot.
Martin Luther King was killed.

2135
02:12:58,286 --> 02:12:59,844
Her life's been threatened!

2136
02:12:59,996 --> 02:13:02,988
A crank making calls.
Happens a dozen times a day at the office.

2137
02:13:03,206 --> 02:13:05,674
Our home! A kidnapper, a murderer!

2138
02:13:06,249 --> 02:13:07,921
Only cowards make crank calls.

2139
02:13:08,293 --> 02:13:09,772
Nothing will happen.

2140
02:13:10,002 --> 02:13:14,314
You don't know what goes on here
anymore! You're busy making speeches!

2141
02:13:14,839 --> 02:13:17,512
Getting every crazed Klansman after us!

2142
02:13:17,841 --> 02:13:22,073
I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!
I can't stand it anymore!

2143
02:13:22,344 --> 02:13:25,097
- The government wants us scared.
- You and your government!

2144
02:13:25,304 --> 02:13:28,853
They want everybody too scared
to speak out. They count on it.

2145
02:13:29,182 --> 02:13:32,060
- There's nothing to fear!
- Don't you have feelings?

2146
02:13:34,019 --> 02:13:35,691
Your own daughter!

2147
02:13:36,187 --> 02:13:38,223
What kind of a man are you?

2148
02:13:41,690 --> 02:13:45,524
I'll take them to my mother's.
You spend a week.

2149
02:13:45,985 --> 02:13:48,658
I'll change the locks, the phones.
I'll get a bodyguard.

2150
02:13:48,862 --> 02:13:50,773
Get a hold of yourself!

2151
02:13:51,197 --> 02:13:54,667
Before this Kennedy thing,
your children mattered most.

2152
02:13:55,200 --> 02:13:58,033
The other night you didn't
even notice Jasper.

2153
02:13:58,285 --> 02:14:00,355
He came to me bawling his eyes out.

2154
02:14:00,537 --> 02:14:03,335
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.

2155
02:14:03,830 --> 02:14:05,502
Is it such a chore?

2156
02:14:05,665 --> 02:14:09,453
Goddamn it! If I said I'll spend
more time with him, I will!

2157
02:14:10,168 --> 02:14:12,318
I cannot fight you and the whole world too!

2158
02:14:12,503 --> 02:14:15,176
I'm not fighting you!
I'm trying to reach you.

2159
02:14:15,713 --> 02:14:18,432
- You've changed.
- Of course I've changed!

2160
02:14:19,300 --> 02:14:20,858
My eyes have opened.

2161
02:14:21,384 --> 02:14:24,103
And what once looked normal
seems insane.

2162
02:14:24,303 --> 02:14:27,818
And now King. Don't you think
this has something to do with that?

2163
02:14:28,056 --> 02:14:29,125
Can't you see?

2164
02:14:29,264 --> 02:14:33,052
I don't want to see, goddamn it!
I'm tired. I've had enough!

2165
02:14:33,726 --> 02:14:37,560
You're ruining this man Shaw's life
because he's a homosexual.

2166
02:14:37,854 --> 02:14:39,333
That's not why!

2167
02:14:39,814 --> 02:14:42,851
Did you ever once stop
to consider his feelings?

2168
02:14:45,401 --> 02:14:46,959
You don't believe me?

2169
02:14:47,361 --> 02:14:49,955
- I don't know!
- You never believed me?

2170
02:14:51,238 --> 02:14:54,833
I just want to raise our children
and live a normal life.

2171
02:14:55,116 --> 02:14:56,868
I want my life back!

2172
02:14:58,034 --> 02:14:59,786
So do I, goddamn it!

2173
02:15:00,452 --> 02:15:02,408
I had a life too, you know!

2174
02:15:02,871 --> 02:15:06,500
You can't bury your head in the sand
like an ostrich, Liz!

2175
02:15:06,915 --> 02:15:11,193
It's not about our well-being, our two cars,
our TVs and your kitchen!

2176
02:15:13,378 --> 02:15:16,495
It's about our kids growing up
in a shithole of lies. I'm angry!

2177
02:15:16,714 --> 02:15:18,750
My life is fucked because of it.

2178
02:15:19,132 --> 02:15:22,169
If you could see it that way,
you'd see your life is fucked too.

2179
02:15:22,384 --> 02:15:24,056
You never talked to me this way.

2180
02:15:24,218 --> 02:15:26,254
If you don't want to support me, fine.

2181
02:15:26,428 --> 02:15:29,226
But don't make threats
about taking the children.

2182
02:15:29,430 --> 02:15:30,829
I'm leaving you!

2183
02:15:31,098 --> 02:15:33,532
- I'm taking the children!
- Go on! Get out!

2184
02:15:33,725 --> 02:15:35,158
- I am!
- Go hide!

2185
02:15:35,393 --> 02:15:37,543
Join the rest! They'll say I'm crazy.

2186
02:15:37,728 --> 02:15:40,196
Plenty of people will tell you I'm crazy.

2187
02:15:41,981 --> 02:15:45,212
You won't have any problems
filling out divorce papers.

2188
02:15:46,443 --> 02:15:48,832
But somebody's got to try, goddamn it!

2189
02:15:49,236 --> 02:15:50,510
Somebody!

2190
02:15:54,781 --> 02:15:56,772
Are we going away, Daddy?

2191
02:16:04,246 --> 02:16:05,884
I don't know, Jasper.

2192
02:16:06,789 --> 02:16:07,983
Because of Kennedy?

2193
02:16:08,916 --> 02:16:11,384
Will the same people kill us, Papa?

2194
02:16:14,253 --> 02:16:16,005
Nobody will kill us.

2195
02:16:16,754 --> 02:16:17,823
I'm scared.

2196
02:16:19,131 --> 02:16:21,929
I don't like it when you and Mommy fight.

2197
02:16:24,927 --> 02:16:26,838
I don't like it either, honey.

2198
02:16:27,970 --> 02:16:29,926
Why do we have to leave?

2199
02:16:30,806 --> 02:16:32,842
Don't you love us anymore?

2200
02:16:35,767 --> 02:16:37,564
Daddy loves you both.

2201
02:16:39,312 --> 02:16:42,543
There's nothing wrong
with feeling a little scared, Jasper.

2202
02:16:42,939 --> 02:16:45,976
Telling the truth can be
a scary thing sometimes.

2203
02:16:47,108 --> 02:16:49,986
It scared President Kennedy,
and he was a brave man.

2204
02:16:51,112 --> 02:16:53,672
But if you let yourself be too scared...

2205
02:16:53,988 --> 02:16:56,980
...then you let the bad guys
take over the country.

2206
02:16:58,700 --> 02:17:00,452
Then everybody gets scared.

2207
02:17:01,618 --> 02:17:03,290
Stay with Mom, Papa.

2208
02:17:03,453 --> 02:17:04,647
Please.

2209
02:17:12,376 --> 02:17:13,604
Here's another.

2210
02:17:13,835 --> 02:17:17,066
The US Attorney in Washington declines
to serve our subpoena...

2211
02:17:17,296 --> 02:17:21,494
...on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell,
CIA Director Richard Helms, any FBI agent.

2212
02:17:21,799 --> 02:17:24,359
What'd you expect from a pig but a grunt?

2213
02:17:24,676 --> 02:17:28,794
Now it'll be near impossible
to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA.

2214
02:17:29,137 --> 02:17:30,456
What's going on?

2215
02:17:30,680 --> 02:17:33,797
We've never been refused
an extradition request.

2216
02:17:34,182 --> 02:17:36,173
Let's get Julia Ann Mercer in here.

2217
02:17:36,351 --> 02:17:38,103
No, she could get hurt.

2218
02:17:38,602 --> 02:17:40,832
Look what's happening to other people.

2219
02:17:41,021 --> 02:17:43,012
She's the best witness we have.

2220
02:17:43,189 --> 02:17:46,147
I just don't want to do it. Now, what else?

2221
02:17:47,399 --> 02:17:50,709
You got your hate mail here.
And your fan mail here.

2222
02:17:52,069 --> 02:17:56,506
The bad news is that the IRS requested
an audit of your income from this office.

2223
02:17:57,657 --> 02:18:01,332
I expected that two months ago.
They're wasting their time.

2224
02:18:04,327 --> 02:18:08,320
The bad news is the National Guard
just asked me to resign after 18 years.

2225
02:18:09,707 --> 02:18:13,222
Maybe that's the good news.
Never was as good as combat.

2226
02:18:14,543 --> 02:18:15,532
But this is.

2227
02:18:17,003 --> 02:18:18,721
Any more on Oswald or Shaw?

2228
02:18:20,755 --> 02:18:23,747
They were seen together in Clinton
in early September.

2229
02:18:24,133 --> 02:18:27,762
The Civil Rights Movement
was running a voter's registration drive.

2230
02:18:28,345 --> 02:18:31,496
Rumor is, Shaw was working
on some arms deal...

2231
02:18:31,763 --> 02:18:34,231
...to discredit the Civil Rights Movement.

2232
02:18:34,640 --> 02:18:37,632
Nobody really knows
what they were doing there, but...

2233
02:18:37,851 --> 02:18:39,921
...hell, they stood out like cotton balls.

2234
02:18:40,102 --> 02:18:42,696
I got whites and coloreds
that saw them there.

2235
02:18:42,896 --> 02:18:46,206
Last time I checked,
it was not illegal to register to vote.

2236
02:18:47,274 --> 02:18:48,912
We still got the...

2237
02:18:49,316 --> 02:18:53,628
...the junkie, Vernon Bundy,
who saw him talking at the sea wall.

2238
02:18:54,446 --> 02:18:57,085
This is tough.
No one wants to talk about Shaw.

2239
02:18:57,531 --> 02:18:59,010
You keep saying that.

2240
02:18:59,366 --> 02:19:01,800
- I keep saying what?
- You're not digging deep enough.

2241
02:19:01,992 --> 02:19:04,790
You want to do my job!
You do my job, I'll do your job.

2242
02:19:04,994 --> 02:19:07,349
I think Clinton is a breakthrough now.

2243
02:19:09,122 --> 02:19:11,397
Shaw denies ever knowing Oswald, right?

2244
02:19:12,666 --> 02:19:14,304
That proves he's a liar.

2245
02:19:16,335 --> 02:19:18,053
- Keep on it, Bill.
- This is the interesting part.

2246
02:19:18,879 --> 02:19:20,995
Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks...

2247
02:19:21,172 --> 02:19:22,890
...before the assassination.

2248
02:19:23,049 --> 02:19:24,846
May I see Special Agent Hosty?

2249
02:19:25,007 --> 02:19:27,043
He's not in. Can someone else help you?

2250
02:19:27,217 --> 02:19:30,926
Special Agent Hosty made three visits
to Janet Williams' house...

2251
02:19:31,345 --> 02:19:33,939
...to keep an eye on Marina. He left a note.

2252
02:19:34,139 --> 02:19:36,937
Hosty told a newspaperman
it was a warning...

2253
02:19:37,392 --> 02:19:40,702
...to stop questioning Marina
when Oswald was not present.

2254
02:19:40,977 --> 02:19:45,414
She was not a citizen, so possibly
he was threatening to deport her to Russia.

2255
02:19:46,439 --> 02:19:48,589
But what the note really said,
no one knows.

2256
02:19:49,149 --> 02:19:51,663
Hosty tore it up
and flushed it down the toilet.

2257
02:19:51,860 --> 02:19:53,498
This is just speculation.

2258
02:19:53,860 --> 02:19:57,489
But what if the note described
the assassination attempt on JFK?

2259
02:20:03,993 --> 02:20:05,506
Come on, think!

2260
02:20:05,994 --> 02:20:08,224
That's the only reason to destroy it.

2261
02:20:08,663 --> 02:20:12,417
If it was a threat like Hosty said,
they would have kept it.

2262
02:20:13,041 --> 02:20:16,670
It makes their case against the angry,
lone nut that much stronger.

2263
02:20:17,376 --> 02:20:19,446
Remember the meeting
with Agent Quigley...

2264
02:20:19,628 --> 02:20:21,061
...the day he was arrested?

2265
02:20:21,213 --> 02:20:23,932
Quigley destroyed the notes
from the interview.

2266
02:20:24,340 --> 02:20:28,128
We can raise the possibility
that Oswald was not only an informant...

2267
02:20:28,968 --> 02:20:33,644
...but he may have been the original source
for the telex dated November 17...

2268
02:20:34,346 --> 02:20:38,259
...warning of Kennedy's assassination
in Dallas on November 22.

2269
02:20:40,851 --> 02:20:44,764
William Walter, the FBI night clerk,
gave me a copy.

2270
02:20:45,354 --> 02:20:47,993
It went all over the country.
Nothing was done.

2271
02:20:48,189 --> 02:20:51,818
The motorcade went ahead on schedule.
The Warren Report didn't mention it.

2272
02:20:52,067 --> 02:20:55,855
"A militant group may attempt
to assassinate President Kennedy...

2273
02:20:56,112 --> 02:20:58,068
"...on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas."

2274
02:20:58,572 --> 02:21:00,244
Shortly after the assassination...

2275
02:21:00,406 --> 02:21:04,319
...Walter says the telex was removed
from all the files...

2276
02:21:04,742 --> 02:21:07,302
...as an obvious embarrassment
to the Bureau.

2277
02:21:08,703 --> 02:21:11,012
I believe Oswald sent information
through Hosty.

2278
02:21:11,664 --> 02:21:15,134
I have a hunch Oswald
had infiltrated this group:

2279
02:21:15,542 --> 02:21:17,737
Cubans or right-wing extremists.

2280
02:21:18,502 --> 02:21:21,812
He was told to be
at the Book Depository that day...

2281
02:21:22,338 --> 02:21:25,136
...to either prevent the assassination
or take part in it.

2282
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:29,196
Either they told him
they'd close down the plotters...

2283
02:21:30,343 --> 02:21:31,742
...or simulate an attack...

2284
02:21:31,886 --> 02:21:34,161
...on Kennedy to whip up public opinion...

2285
02:21:34,346 --> 02:21:37,418
...so Kennedy would have to reverse
his policies on communism.

2286
02:21:38,348 --> 02:21:40,418
What they told him doesn't matter.

2287
02:21:41,058 --> 02:21:42,491
He was under orders.

2288
02:21:42,643 --> 02:21:44,395
He was a foot soldier.

2289
02:21:47,063 --> 02:21:49,782
You can't miss. He is a dead duck.

2290
02:21:51,066 --> 02:21:52,294
I don't buy it.

2291
02:21:52,733 --> 02:21:54,644
Why would the FBI cover it up?

2292
02:21:55,026 --> 02:21:58,621
A telex disappears from every FBI office
in this country?

2293
02:21:59,363 --> 02:22:00,842
There's a word, Bill.

2294
02:22:01,072 --> 02:22:02,983
- Orders.
- Or a cover-up.

2295
02:22:04,116 --> 02:22:07,028
Don't you have enough proof
of the FBI's complicity yet?

2296
02:22:07,243 --> 02:22:09,473
I respect this country's institutions!

2297
02:22:11,829 --> 02:22:15,060
How the hell can you keep
a conspiracy going...

2298
02:22:15,416 --> 02:22:19,967
...between the mob, CIA, FBI, Army
intelligence and who knows what else...

2299
02:22:20,377 --> 02:22:24,086
...when you can't keep a secret
in this room between 12 people?

2300
02:22:24,422 --> 02:22:26,378
I mean, we got leaks everywhere.

2301
02:22:26,548 --> 02:22:28,743
We are going to trial, y'all!

2302
02:22:29,425 --> 02:22:31,495
What the hell do we really got?

2303
02:22:31,760 --> 02:22:34,593
Oswald, Ruby, Banister,
and Ferrie are dead.

2304
02:22:35,429 --> 02:22:38,068
Maybe Shaw is an agent. I don't know.

2305
02:22:38,390 --> 02:22:39,948
But as a covert operator...

2306
02:22:40,099 --> 02:22:43,489
...he is wide open for blackmail
because of his homosexuality.

2307
02:22:43,727 --> 02:22:47,436
Shaw's our toehold.
I don't know or care exactly how he fits.

2308
02:22:48,105 --> 02:22:51,142
But he's lying through his teeth.
I won't let go of him.

2309
02:22:51,440 --> 02:22:54,079
That's why you're going to trial
against Clay Shaw?

2310
02:22:54,275 --> 02:22:55,754
You will lose!

2311
02:22:56,110 --> 02:22:58,783
We should investigate
our Mafia leads here.

2312
02:22:59,070 --> 02:23:02,142
I can buy that easier
than I can the government.

2313
02:23:03,448 --> 02:23:06,838
Ruby is all mob, knows Oswald,
sets him up.

2314
02:23:07,743 --> 02:23:11,577
Hoffa, Trafficante, Marcello,
they hire some guns and do Kennedy.

2315
02:23:12,079 --> 02:23:15,389
The government doesn't want
to open up a whole can of worms...

2316
02:23:15,623 --> 02:23:18,501
...because it used the mob
to try to get Castro.

2317
02:23:19,293 --> 02:23:22,603
Castro being assassinated
by the mob by us...

2318
02:23:22,961 --> 02:23:24,872
...sounds wild to John Q. Citizen.

2319
02:23:25,046 --> 02:23:27,401
So they close the book on JFK.

2320
02:23:29,091 --> 02:23:30,524
Makes perfect sense to me.

2321
02:23:30,676 --> 02:23:33,554
I don't doubt their involvement
at a low level.

2322
02:23:34,469 --> 02:23:36,744
Could the mob change the parade route?

2323
02:23:37,138 --> 02:23:39,811
Or eliminate the protection
for the President?

2324
02:23:40,224 --> 02:23:43,261
Could the mob send Oswald to Russia
and get him back?

2325
02:23:43,809 --> 02:23:48,200
Get the FBI, the CIA and the Dallas Police
to mess up the investigation?

2326
02:23:48,604 --> 02:23:51,801
Get the Warren Commission appointed
to cover it up?

2327
02:23:52,440 --> 02:23:56,513
Wreck the autopsy? Influence
the national media to go to sleep?

2328
02:23:57,027 --> 02:24:00,383
Since when has the mob used anything
but.38's for hits up close?

2329
02:24:02,322 --> 02:24:06,395
The mob wouldn't have the guts or
the power for something of this magnitude.

2330
02:24:06,783 --> 02:24:08,739
Assassins need payrolls...

2331
02:24:09,327 --> 02:24:11,318
...schedules, times, orders.

2332
02:24:12,328 --> 02:24:14,717
This was a military-style ambush.

2333
02:24:15,163 --> 02:24:18,519
A coup d'tat with Lyndon Johnson
waiting in the wings.

2334
02:24:18,958 --> 02:24:22,587
You're saying Lyndon Johnson
was involved? The President?

2335
02:24:23,295 --> 02:24:26,526
Johnson got $1 billion for his friends,
Brown and Root...

2336
02:24:26,838 --> 02:24:29,193
...to dredge Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam.

2337
02:24:29,465 --> 02:24:32,502
Boss, are you calling the President
a murderer?

2338
02:24:32,801 --> 02:24:36,191
If I'm so far from the truth,
why is the FBI bugging our offices?

2339
02:24:36,428 --> 02:24:39,101
Why are witnesses being bought off
and murdered?

2340
02:24:39,513 --> 02:24:42,983
Why are federal agencies blocking
our extraditions and subpoenas?

2341
02:24:43,308 --> 02:24:44,741
I don't know.

2342
02:24:45,143 --> 02:24:48,021
Maybe there's some rogue element
in the government.

2343
02:24:48,311 --> 02:24:50,381
With a full-blown cover-up?

2344
02:24:51,856 --> 02:24:53,767
You ever read Shakespeare?

2345
02:24:56,484 --> 02:24:57,599
I do.

2346
02:24:58,318 --> 02:24:59,797
Julius Caesar?

2347
02:25:00,653 --> 02:25:03,804
"Brutus and Cassius,
they too are honorable men."

2348
02:25:04,697 --> 02:25:06,289
Who killed Caesar?

2349
02:25:07,157 --> 02:25:09,068
Ten or twelve Senators.

2350
02:25:09,367 --> 02:25:11,403
All it takes is one Judas.

2351
02:25:12,202 --> 02:25:15,080
A few people on the inside. Pentagon, CIA.

2352
02:25:15,539 --> 02:25:17,211
This is Louisiana.

2353
02:25:17,874 --> 02:25:22,106
How do you know who your daddy is?
'Cause your mama told you so.

2354
02:25:23,210 --> 02:25:25,440
You are taking a crap in the wind.

2355
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:28,798
And I am not going along on this one.

2356
02:25:39,012 --> 02:25:41,731
I've had my doubts all along about Bill.

2357
02:25:42,390 --> 02:25:44,221
He's been fighting us.

2358
02:25:45,642 --> 02:25:46,961
We need him back.

2359
02:25:47,393 --> 02:25:49,588
He wasted a month trying to prove...

2360
02:25:49,853 --> 02:25:53,368
...that mob boys like Jack Ruby
are hooked up with Hunt Oil.

2361
02:25:53,690 --> 02:25:55,885
- I don't trust him.
- I will not hear this.

2362
02:25:56,066 --> 02:25:58,819
I value Bill as much as any person here.

2363
02:26:00,235 --> 02:26:04,069
It's time we made room
for someone else's ideas, including me.

2364
02:26:05,531 --> 02:26:08,409
Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is,
and I'm...

2365
02:26:09,075 --> 02:26:10,906
...just plain dumb about it.

2366
02:26:11,076 --> 02:26:13,715
I've seen him copying files here
late at night.

2367
02:26:13,911 --> 02:26:16,471
- I don't trust him.
- Did you two hear me?

2368
02:26:16,746 --> 02:26:18,976
I won't tolerate staff infighting.

2369
02:26:19,248 --> 02:26:22,445
I'm afraid I cannot work
with Bill Broussard anymore.

2370
02:26:23,876 --> 02:26:25,468
Is this an ultimatum?

2371
02:26:27,212 --> 02:26:28,850
Are you giving me an ultimatum?

2372
02:26:29,004 --> 02:26:31,120
If that's what you want to call it.

2373
02:26:33,424 --> 02:26:35,494
I never thought it'd come to this.

2374
02:26:39,220 --> 02:26:40,414
I guess I am.

2375
02:26:41,764 --> 02:26:46,155
I won't have any ultimatum put to me, Lou.
I'll accept your resignation.

2376
02:26:50,561 --> 02:26:52,040
You sure got it.

2377
02:26:57,441 --> 02:26:59,955
You are one stubborn son of a bitch.

2378
02:27:02,402 --> 02:27:04,233
You're making a big mistake.

2379
02:27:11,700 --> 02:27:14,294
Boss, aren't you being a little hard?

2380
02:27:15,662 --> 02:27:17,334
No, I don't think I am.

2381
02:27:18,997 --> 02:27:20,146
Anyone else?

2382
02:27:25,293 --> 02:27:27,966
Now, Jerry, here's Jim Garrison...

2383
02:27:28,628 --> 02:27:31,540
...the District Attorney
of New Orleans, Louisiana.

2384
02:27:38,051 --> 02:27:39,166
APPLAUSE

2385
02:27:46,349 --> 02:27:48,499
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison.

2386
02:27:49,434 --> 02:27:52,665
You're investigating the murder
of President Kennedy.

2387
02:27:53,354 --> 02:27:56,664
We have heard some strange things
coming out of your office.

2388
02:27:57,566 --> 02:28:01,115
First, we heard that Cuban exiles
killed the President.

2389
02:28:01,359 --> 02:28:02,758
Then the mob...

2390
02:28:03,027 --> 02:28:07,623
Your latest theory seems to be
that the CIA and the FBI...

2391
02:28:07,906 --> 02:28:09,180
...and the Pentagon...

2392
02:28:09,324 --> 02:28:14,273
...and the White House all combined
in an elaborate conspiracy to kill Kennedy.

2393
02:28:16,286 --> 02:28:18,436
Is there anyone
besides Lee Harvey Oswald...

2394
02:28:18,621 --> 02:28:21,693
...who you think didn't conspire
to kill the President?

2395
02:28:24,417 --> 02:28:26,294
Let's just say this, Jerry...

2396
02:28:27,085 --> 02:28:28,598
...l've stopped beating my wife.

2397
02:28:30,880 --> 02:28:34,031
Maybe you should ask Lyndon Johnson.
He has some answers.

2398
02:28:38,385 --> 02:28:41,457
There have been a number of reports
in reputable news media...

2399
02:28:41,678 --> 02:28:43,953
...Time, Newsweek, our own NBC...

2400
02:28:44,555 --> 02:28:48,343
...that you've gone beyond legal means
as a prosecutor...

2401
02:28:49,433 --> 02:28:52,311
...that you've intimidated,
even drugged witnesses...

2402
02:28:52,520 --> 02:28:55,512
...bribed them, and urged them
to commit perjury.

2403
02:28:56,063 --> 02:28:57,462
Do you have a response?

2404
02:28:57,606 --> 02:29:00,803
Your faith in the veracity
of the major media is touching.

2405
02:29:01,150 --> 02:29:04,028
It indicates that the age of innocence
is not yet over.

2406
02:29:04,236 --> 02:29:05,669
But ask yourself...

2407
02:29:05,820 --> 02:29:08,414
...if we had learned
on November 22, 1963...

2408
02:29:08,613 --> 02:29:11,889
...that the Russian Premier had been shot
from a Moscow building...

2409
02:29:12,116 --> 02:29:13,993
...by a lonely capitalist sympathizer...

2410
02:29:14,159 --> 02:29:18,277
...who, himself, was then liquidated
by a patriotic Muscovite within 48 hours...

2411
02:29:18,537 --> 02:29:20,255
...while surrounded by armed police.

2412
02:29:20,413 --> 02:29:22,768
I think it would be apparent to anyone...

2413
02:29:22,956 --> 02:29:27,074
...that a coup d'tat and a transfer
of power had just taken place.

2414
02:29:27,709 --> 02:29:31,418
And we would not ask questions
or attack Jim Garrison.

2415
02:29:31,796 --> 02:29:34,026
We would, in a free-thinking society...

2416
02:29:34,214 --> 02:29:38,207
...be asking why he was killed,
and what forces opposed him.

2417
02:29:39,051 --> 02:29:42,248
There are some people who might say
that you are paranoid.

2418
02:29:42,595 --> 02:29:45,712
I should show you some pictures
so you can understand...

2419
02:29:46,389 --> 02:29:48,107
...what I'm talking about.

2420
02:29:49,350 --> 02:29:50,863
These are arrests.

2421
02:29:51,267 --> 02:29:54,703
These arrests were photographed
minutes after the assassination.

2422
02:29:54,937 --> 02:29:57,132
They were never shown to the public.

2423
02:29:57,313 --> 02:29:59,508
I'm sorry,
these pictures can't be shown on TV.

2424
02:29:59,690 --> 02:30:02,124
- Sure they can.
- No, I'm sorry. They can't.

2425
02:30:02,650 --> 02:30:05,289
- The camera can pick these up.
- Jim, I'm sorry.

2426
02:30:05,652 --> 02:30:08,246
They can't. We have libel laws.

2427
02:30:08,613 --> 02:30:12,401
Those men you just saw were arrested
in Dallas minutes after the assassination.

2428
02:30:12,657 --> 02:30:14,329
They were never seen again.

2429
02:30:14,492 --> 02:30:17,450
No record of arrest,
no mug shots, no fingerprints.

2430
02:30:17,870 --> 02:30:19,064
Hold that thought.

2431
02:30:19,203 --> 02:30:21,876
We'll be back,
right after these commercials.

2432
02:30:33,171 --> 02:30:35,287
Bill, what the hell are you doing here?

2433
02:30:35,464 --> 02:30:39,457
I'm sorry about the other day.
I didn't mean to walk out on you like that.

2434
02:30:40,593 --> 02:30:43,153
You came all this way
to tell me the obvious?

2435
02:30:43,636 --> 02:30:44,785
No. Look...

2436
02:30:45,263 --> 02:30:49,097
...I just heard of an attempt to kill you
between here and New Orleans.

2437
02:30:49,974 --> 02:30:53,171
A mob guy was brought down by Shaw
from Canada.

2438
02:30:53,602 --> 02:30:56,594
This is serious.
You'll need a bodyguard tonight.

2439
02:30:57,396 --> 02:31:01,150
When you were in the Army,
did you ever find out what an order meant?

2440
02:31:01,524 --> 02:31:04,561
Do you remember my orders
about passing on rumors...

2441
02:31:04,776 --> 02:31:06,892
...about someone going to be killed?

2442
02:31:07,069 --> 02:31:09,708
- Yes, I do, but this is...
- No, there is no "but."

2443
02:31:09,904 --> 02:31:12,464
There is no "but" in a military situation!

2444
02:31:13,199 --> 02:31:16,191
I don't appreciate you dumping
this paranoid garbage on me...

2445
02:31:16,409 --> 02:31:18,718
...nor your inability
to follow a simple order...

2446
02:31:18,910 --> 02:31:23,108
...especially when it means I have to pay
for your flight back to New Orleans.

2447
02:31:24,080 --> 02:31:25,718
Let's get you a ticket.

2448
02:31:27,250 --> 02:31:29,844
Boss, I'm sorry.
I'm just looking out for you.

2449
02:31:30,794 --> 02:31:32,193
Get a receipt.

2450
02:32:19,577 --> 02:32:21,215
Come on, come on. He's out here.

2451
02:32:21,369 --> 02:32:24,441
Jim, where are you going?
It's me, Samuel.

2452
02:32:33,253 --> 02:32:37,166
- Hey, how long were you in that restroom?
- None of your goddamn business.

2453
02:33:26,539 --> 02:33:28,973
Jim, bad news, Bill's turned.

2454
02:33:29,208 --> 02:33:31,802
I think he's given everything we've got
to the feds.

2455
02:33:32,001 --> 02:33:35,152
We studied the memos
and there was nothing there. Nothing.

2456
02:33:35,378 --> 02:33:38,893
We went to confront him and the landlady
said the son of a bitch just left.

2457
02:33:39,131 --> 02:33:40,450
Left everything.

2458
02:33:41,049 --> 02:33:42,721
It's unbelievable. I'm sorry.

2459
02:33:42,884 --> 02:33:45,682
Mattie, could you get Mr. Garrison
a drink, please?

2460
02:33:46,053 --> 02:33:47,771
Something sure scared him.

2461
02:33:47,929 --> 02:33:50,762
Bill doesn't scare that easy.
Somebody got to his thinking.

2462
02:33:50,972 --> 02:33:53,964
- He was never that good a thinker.
- He sure fooled us.

2463
02:33:55,184 --> 02:33:58,460
No, no, leave it. Don't turn it down.
I want to see this.

2464
02:33:59,729 --> 02:34:02,038
You know what's happening, he's winning.

2465
02:34:04,440 --> 02:34:06,317
He'll never make it.

2466
02:34:07,150 --> 02:34:10,665
If he wins, they'll kill him.
He'll stop the war.

2467
02:34:12,570 --> 02:34:15,368
They'll kill him
before they let him be President.

2468
02:34:20,827 --> 02:34:23,216
With Broussard, they have everything...

2469
02:34:23,412 --> 02:34:25,972
...all our witnesses,
our strategies for the trial.

2470
02:34:26,163 --> 02:34:27,835
We got to double check his work.

2471
02:34:27,998 --> 02:34:30,751
There could be false leads.
We can't go to trial!

2472
02:34:31,042 --> 02:34:32,361
We don't have a prayer!

2473
02:34:32,500 --> 02:34:35,492
- I don't think so, Al.
- I have to agree with Al, Boss.

2474
02:34:36,212 --> 02:34:38,567
This is not one we'll come out on.

2475
02:34:38,755 --> 02:34:41,952
You remember the Hemingway story,
The Old Man and the Sea?

2476
02:34:42,966 --> 02:34:45,924
The old fisherman manages
to catch this great fish...

2477
02:34:46,593 --> 02:34:50,427
...a fish so huge, that he has to tie it
to the boat to get it back in.

2478
02:34:50,930 --> 02:34:52,648
By the time it reached shore...

2479
02:34:52,806 --> 02:34:55,843
...the fish had long since been picked apart
by sharks.

2480
02:34:59,603 --> 02:35:01,321
Nothing was left, but the skeleton.

2481
02:35:01,479 --> 02:35:05,267
- And that's what will happen to us.
- Then what did we do this for?

2482
02:35:05,523 --> 02:35:07,115
It's a means to an end.

2483
02:35:07,691 --> 02:35:09,568
This war has two fronts.

2484
02:35:11,069 --> 02:35:15,108
In a court of law,
we hope to get Clay Shaw for conspiracy.

2485
02:35:15,447 --> 02:35:19,201
In the court of public opinion,
it could take another 25, 30 years...

2486
02:35:19,574 --> 02:35:21,451
...for the truth to come out.

2487
02:35:23,619 --> 02:35:26,087
At least we'll strike the first blow.

2488
02:35:27,789 --> 02:35:29,268
What if you're wrong?

2489
02:35:33,417 --> 02:35:35,931
I never thought for a second I was.

2490
02:35:39,714 --> 02:35:41,750
Will you come to the trial?

2491
02:35:43,382 --> 02:35:44,132
I don't think so.

2492
02:35:46,385 --> 02:35:51,664
With 53% of the precincts reporting,
Sen. Kennedy has a 48% to 41% lead...

2493
02:35:51,972 --> 02:35:53,485
...over Sen. McCarthy.

2494
02:35:53,682 --> 02:35:56,150
CBS News projects Sen. Robert Kennedy...

2495
02:35:56,350 --> 02:35:58,705
...the winner of the California primary.

2496
02:35:59,018 --> 02:36:03,057
Within the United States over the period
of the last three years...

2497
02:36:03,396 --> 02:36:07,594
...the division, the violence,
the disenchantment with our society...

2498
02:36:07,858 --> 02:36:10,088
...the divisions between blacks
and whites...

2499
02:36:10,276 --> 02:36:13,393
...the poor and the affluent,
between age groups...

2500
02:36:13,653 --> 02:36:16,087
...or Vietnam, we can work together.

2501
02:36:16,363 --> 02:36:20,072
We are a great country, an unselfish,
compassionate country.

2502
02:36:20,324 --> 02:36:22,963
That's my basis for running.

2503
02:36:26,954 --> 02:36:30,503
Thank you all.
It's on to Chicago and let's win there.

2504
02:36:43,591 --> 02:36:45,502
Senator Kennedy has been shot!

2505
02:37:28,412 --> 02:37:30,004
They killed him, honey.

2506
02:37:32,665 --> 02:37:33,939
He won...

2507
02:37:34,333 --> 02:37:36,563
...and they killed Robert Kennedy.

2508
02:37:38,670 --> 02:37:40,103
They shot him down.

2509
02:37:42,422 --> 02:37:43,775
Oh, my God!

2510
02:37:46,591 --> 02:37:47,944
Both of them?

2511
02:37:48,843 --> 02:37:50,322
Both brothers?

2512
02:37:55,764 --> 02:37:57,197
You were right.

2513
02:37:59,266 --> 02:38:01,018
It hasn't ended yet.

2514
02:38:08,773 --> 02:38:10,445
For the first time...

2515
02:38:12,192 --> 02:38:14,103
...I feel really scared.

2516
02:38:27,036 --> 02:38:29,266
I wish I could've loved you more.

2517
02:38:32,331 --> 02:38:36,609
Sometimes I feel like
I didn't ever love you...

2518
02:38:37,709 --> 02:38:39,620
...or the children enough.

2519
02:38:41,712 --> 02:38:42,986
I'm sorry.

2520
02:39:26,743 --> 02:39:28,017
Please rise.

2521
02:39:30,746 --> 02:39:35,262
The Criminal District Court for Orleans
Parish, Section H, is now in session.

2522
02:39:35,958 --> 02:39:39,792
Honorable Judge Edward A. Haggerty, Jr.
Presiding. Be seated.

2523
02:39:45,381 --> 02:39:46,734
That's Clay Bertrand.

2524
02:39:46,882 --> 02:39:48,759
That's who I saw at Ferrie's.

2525
02:39:48,966 --> 02:39:50,718
That's who you say you saw.

2526
02:39:51,969 --> 02:39:53,561
A confessed homosexual.

2527
02:39:54,804 --> 02:39:57,079
Convicted of pandering and soliciting.

2528
02:39:57,972 --> 02:40:00,202
A man who has lied about everything...

2529
02:40:00,807 --> 02:40:03,275
...and now wants to be taken at his word.

2530
02:40:03,476 --> 02:40:05,990
That man, right there. Yes, sir.

2531
02:40:06,395 --> 02:40:08,625
He was at the Pontchartrain wall...

2532
02:40:09,397 --> 02:40:11,706
...with the man who shot the President.

2533
02:40:12,690 --> 02:40:15,124
I remember him because of his limp.

2534
02:40:15,401 --> 02:40:18,199
A heroin addict injecting himself
at the wall.

2535
02:40:18,737 --> 02:40:20,932
Barely conscious of his surroundings.

2536
02:40:21,113 --> 02:40:23,866
- Is that the man?
- That was the man, right there.

2537
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:26,310
He dropped Oswald off on the voter's line.

2538
02:40:26,784 --> 02:40:30,174
I remember 'cause they were the only
white strangers around that day.

2539
02:40:30,411 --> 02:40:33,881
That big black Cadillac of his
made me think they might be FBI.

2540
02:40:34,247 --> 02:40:37,205
Welcome to Clinton.
If you need any help, let us know.

2541
02:40:37,416 --> 02:40:41,170
He said he was a representative
of Warren International Trade Mart.

2542
02:40:41,878 --> 02:40:44,438
More than five years ago,
for two minutes...?

2543
02:40:45,255 --> 02:40:47,405
It's fair to say you could be mistaken.

2544
02:40:47,590 --> 02:40:49,626
Just a figment of my imagination.

2545
02:40:49,966 --> 02:40:52,685
The cat's stewing you, I told him.

2546
02:40:52,926 --> 02:40:55,679
You got the right ta-ta,
but the wrong ho-ho.

2547
02:40:56,096 --> 02:40:59,691
Bertrand is not Shaw, scout's honor.
And you can tell him I said so.

2548
02:40:59,931 --> 02:41:01,000
Objection, Your Honor!

2549
02:41:01,141 --> 02:41:04,451
Andrews has been convicted of perjury
on this matter.

2550
02:41:04,684 --> 02:41:07,118
Exception taken. That case is on appeal.

2551
02:41:08,271 --> 02:41:09,499
Mr. Goldberg...

2552
02:41:09,979 --> 02:41:12,652
...you claim you met Ferrie and Shaw
on a vacation trip...

2553
02:41:12,857 --> 02:41:15,007
...from your accounting business
in New York.

2554
02:41:15,192 --> 02:41:16,466
You had drinks...

2555
02:41:16,609 --> 02:41:18,839
...and while drunk,
discussed killing Kennedy.

2556
02:41:19,027 --> 02:41:20,983
- Is that not so?
- Yes, I did.

2557
02:41:21,237 --> 02:41:25,594
Is it also true that you fingerprinted
your daughter when she went to college?

2558
02:41:26,199 --> 02:41:27,314
Yes, sir, I did.

2559
02:41:27,450 --> 02:41:31,204
Is it also true that you fingerprinted her
when she returned?

2560
02:41:31,619 --> 02:41:32,688
Yes, I did.

2561
02:41:33,120 --> 02:41:34,109
Why?

2562
02:41:34,539 --> 02:41:37,656
I wanted to make sure
she was the same girl I sent away.

2563
02:41:41,001 --> 02:41:42,912
He was one of Broussard's witnesses.

2564
02:41:43,085 --> 02:41:45,679
He was totally sane
when we took his affidavit.

2565
02:41:45,879 --> 02:41:49,997
Your Honor, we call Police Officer
Aloysius Habighorst to the stand.

2566
02:41:50,716 --> 02:41:53,105
I must ask the jury to leave the court.

2567
02:41:53,385 --> 02:41:55,660
Gentlemen, will you please rise
and follow me.

2568
02:41:55,845 --> 02:41:58,723
- Name?
- Clay La Verne Shaw.

2569
02:41:58,972 --> 02:42:01,008
Defendant didn't have his lawyer present.

2570
02:42:01,181 --> 02:42:04,173
It's standard booking procedure
to ask an alias!

2571
02:42:04,392 --> 02:42:05,791
I call them as I see them!

2572
02:42:05,935 --> 02:42:07,129
Any aliases?

2573
02:42:07,310 --> 02:42:08,504
Clay Bertrand.

2574
02:42:10,688 --> 02:42:14,317
It's not constitutionally required
that a lawyer be present!

2575
02:42:15,233 --> 02:42:18,111
- I'm ruling that inadmissible!
- That's our case!

2576
02:42:18,401 --> 02:42:20,551
Then you didn't have a case.

2577
02:42:21,195 --> 02:42:23,993
I wouldn't believe anything
Habighorst said anyway.

2578
02:42:24,198 --> 02:42:26,154
I can't believe you're saying this!

2579
02:42:26,323 --> 02:42:28,473
I am saying it. Bring in the jury.

2580
02:42:32,661 --> 02:42:34,731
- Oswald?
- No, I did not.

2581
02:42:36,122 --> 02:42:39,239
- Ever call Dean Andrews?
- No, I did not.

2582
02:42:40,750 --> 02:42:43,025
Have you ever met David Ferrie?

2583
02:42:44,294 --> 02:42:47,809
Wouldn't even know what he looked like
if I hadn't seen pictures.

2584
02:42:49,214 --> 02:42:51,444
Did you ever use the alias, Clay Bertrand?

2585
02:42:51,632 --> 02:42:53,702
No, I did not.

2586
02:42:55,052 --> 02:42:56,804
Thank you, Mr. Shaw.

2587
02:43:00,055 --> 02:43:03,206
A very great actor has just given us
a great performance.

2588
02:43:03,682 --> 02:43:06,037
But we are nowhere closer to the truth.

2589
02:43:06,684 --> 02:43:10,563
My office is charging Clay Shaw
with outright perjury...

2590
02:43:10,854 --> 02:43:15,052
...on 15 answers he's given today,
not one word being true.

2591
02:43:15,357 --> 02:43:17,791
You're out of order! Now, sit down!

2592
02:43:18,192 --> 02:43:19,989
That's the man right there.

2593
02:43:27,032 --> 02:43:30,069
To prove there was a conspiracy
involving Clay Shaw...

2594
02:43:30,701 --> 02:43:34,853
...we must prove there was more than
one man involved in the assassination.

2595
02:43:35,663 --> 02:43:36,732
To do that...

2596
02:43:36,871 --> 02:43:40,341
...we must look at the Zapruder film
which my office subpoenaed.

2597
02:43:41,208 --> 02:43:43,517
The American public has not seen...

2598
02:43:45,544 --> 02:43:50,823
...has not seen the film. It's been locked
in a vault the last five years...

2599
02:43:51,465 --> 02:43:53,899
...in the Time-Life Building in New York.

2600
02:43:55,009 --> 02:43:56,761
There's a reason for that.

2601
02:43:58,053 --> 02:43:58,963
Watch.

2602
02:44:49,338 --> 02:44:51,568
"The picture speaks 1,000 words."

2603
02:44:53,382 --> 02:44:56,419
The Warren Commission thought they had
an open-and-shut case.

2604
02:44:56,635 --> 02:44:58,466
Three bullets, one assassin.

2605
02:44:59,595 --> 02:45:02,871
Two unpredictable things happened
that day to make it impossible.

2606
02:45:03,097 --> 02:45:08,410
One, the film shot by Abraham Zapruder
while standing near the grassy knoll.

2607
02:45:09,268 --> 02:45:13,341
Two, the third wounded man,
James Teague, nicked by a fragment...

2608
02:45:13,729 --> 02:45:16,243
...while standing near the triple underpass.

2609
02:45:16,439 --> 02:45:19,909
The time frame, 5.6 seconds,
established by the Zapruder film...

2610
02:45:20,359 --> 02:45:22,748
...left no possibility of a fourth shot.

2611
02:45:23,278 --> 02:45:27,237
So the shot of fragment that left
a superficial wound on Teague's cheek...

2612
02:45:27,697 --> 02:45:31,895
...came from one of the three bullets
fired from the Depository's sixth floor.

2613
02:45:32,826 --> 02:45:34,703
That leaves just two bullets.

2614
02:45:35,244 --> 02:45:38,520
We know one was the fatal head shot
that killed Kennedy.

2615
02:45:40,539 --> 02:45:42,291
So a single bullet remains.

2616
02:45:42,624 --> 02:45:47,140
A single bullet must account for the seven
wounds in Kennedy and Connally.

2617
02:45:48,169 --> 02:45:51,206
Rather than admit to a conspiracy
or investigate further...

2618
02:45:51,422 --> 02:45:53,777
...the Warren Commission
endorsed the theory...

2619
02:45:53,965 --> 02:45:57,162
...put forth by an ambitious attorney,
Arlen Spector.

2620
02:45:57,384 --> 02:46:00,694
One of the grossest lies ever forced
on the American people.

2621
02:46:02,387 --> 02:46:04,776
It's known as the "magic bullet" theory.

2622
02:46:05,640 --> 02:46:07,073
The magic bullet...

2623
02:46:07,307 --> 02:46:11,539
...enters the President's back,
headed downward at a 17-degree angle.

2624
02:46:12,269 --> 02:46:16,820
It then moves upwards to leave Kennedy's
body from the front of his neck...

2625
02:46:17,481 --> 02:46:18,960
...wound #2...

2626
02:46:19,482 --> 02:46:21,473
...where it waits 1.6 seconds...

2627
02:46:22,276 --> 02:46:25,951
...presumably in midair,
where it turns right, then left...

2628
02:46:26,779 --> 02:46:28,610
...right, then left...

2629
02:46:29,113 --> 02:46:32,389
...and continues
into Connally's right armpit.

2630
02:46:32,825 --> 02:46:34,099
Wound #3.

2631
02:46:34,826 --> 02:46:39,661
The bullet then heads down at an angle
of 27 degrees, shattering his rib...

2632
02:46:40,330 --> 02:46:44,005
...and exiting from the right side
of his chest. Wound #4.

2633
02:46:44,833 --> 02:46:49,304
The bullet turns right, reentering
Connally's body at his right wrist.

2634
02:46:50,295 --> 02:46:51,569
Wound #5.

2635
02:46:52,296 --> 02:46:54,127
Shattering the radius bone...

2636
02:46:54,298 --> 02:46:57,051
...the bullet exits Connally's wrist,
wound #6...

2637
02:46:57,675 --> 02:47:02,066
...makes a dramatic U-turn,
then buries itself in Connally's left thigh.

2638
02:47:02,595 --> 02:47:05,428
Wound #7, from which it later falls out...

2639
02:47:06,139 --> 02:47:08,778
...and is found
in almost pristine condition...

2640
02:47:09,308 --> 02:47:12,266
...on a stretcher in a corridor
of Parkland Hospital.

2641
02:47:14,895 --> 02:47:16,123
Some bullet.

2642
02:47:18,022 --> 02:47:21,094
Any combat vet can tell you,
never in the history of gunfire...

2643
02:47:21,316 --> 02:47:23,830
...has there been a bullet this ridiculous.

2644
02:47:24,860 --> 02:47:29,490
The government says it can prove it
with some fancy physics in a nuclear lab.

2645
02:47:30,197 --> 02:47:31,630
Of course they can.

2646
02:47:31,782 --> 02:47:35,013
Theoretical physics can prove
an elephant can hang from a cliff...

2647
02:47:35,242 --> 02:47:37,312
...with his tail tied to a daisy.

2648
02:47:38,202 --> 02:47:40,477
But use your eyes, your common sense.

2649
02:47:41,205 --> 02:47:45,323
The Army wound ballistics experts
fired some comparison bullets.

2650
02:47:46,042 --> 02:47:48,510
Not one of them looked anything like this.

2651
02:47:50,169 --> 02:47:52,160
Take a look at CE-856.

2652
02:47:53,296 --> 02:47:54,854
An identical bullet...

2653
02:47:55,090 --> 02:47:57,809
...fired through the wrist
of a human cadaver...

2654
02:47:58,550 --> 02:48:01,508
...just one of the bones smashed
by the magic bullet.

2655
02:48:02,636 --> 02:48:04,274
Seven wounds, gentlemen.

2656
02:48:04,596 --> 02:48:05,870
Tough skin...

2657
02:48:06,388 --> 02:48:07,901
...dense bones.

2658
02:48:09,140 --> 02:48:11,210
This single-bullet explanation...

2659
02:48:11,517 --> 02:48:15,305
...is the foundation of the Warren
Commission's claim of one assassin.

2660
02:48:16,061 --> 02:48:17,380
And once you conclude...

2661
02:48:17,521 --> 02:48:20,558
...the magic bullet couldn't create
all seven wounds...

2662
02:48:20,856 --> 02:48:24,644
...you must conclude there was
a fourth shot and a second rifleman.

2663
02:48:26,402 --> 02:48:28,632
And if there was a second rifleman...

2664
02:48:29,154 --> 02:48:32,351
...then by definition there had
to be a conspiracy...

2665
02:48:32,906 --> 02:48:36,023
...which we believe
involves the accused, Clay Shaw.

2666
02:48:36,951 --> 02:48:41,866
Fifty-one witnesses thought
they heard shots from the grassy knoll...

2667
02:48:42,413 --> 02:48:45,371
...which is to the right,
in front of the President.

2668
02:48:46,582 --> 02:48:48,220
Key witnesses that day?

2669
02:48:49,042 --> 02:48:51,192
Charles Brehm, a combat vet.

2670
02:48:51,919 --> 02:48:54,353
Right behind, Jean Hill and Mary Moorman.

2671
02:48:55,130 --> 02:48:57,690
S.M. Holland, Richard Dodd,
James Simmons...

2672
02:48:58,090 --> 02:49:00,604
...standing on the overpass. J.C. Price...

2673
02:49:00,800 --> 02:49:02,472
...overlooking the plaza.

2674
02:49:03,427 --> 02:49:06,066
William Newman, father of two children.

2675
02:49:06,346 --> 02:49:08,780
He hit the deck on the north side of Elm.

2676
02:49:10,140 --> 02:49:11,732
Abraham Zapruder.

2677
02:49:28,528 --> 02:49:31,486
Each of these key witnesses
has no doubt whatsoever...

2678
02:49:31,780 --> 02:49:34,817
...one or more shots came
from behind the picket fence.

2679
02:49:35,825 --> 02:49:38,976
Twenty-six trained medical personnel
at Parkland Hospital...

2680
02:49:39,201 --> 02:49:42,796
...saw the back of the President's head
blasted out!

2681
02:49:45,248 --> 02:49:46,727
Doctor Peters.

2682
02:49:47,333 --> 02:49:51,884
There was a large 7 cm opening
at the right occipital parietal area.

2683
02:49:52,211 --> 02:49:55,009
A considerable portion
of the brain was missing.

2684
02:49:56,672 --> 02:50:01,302
A fifth or possibly a quarter of the back
of the head had been blasted out...

2685
02:50:01,676 --> 02:50:03,792
...along with the underlying brain tissue.

2686
02:50:03,969 --> 02:50:06,437
When's the proper time
to declare one dead?

2687
02:50:07,012 --> 02:50:10,925
There was also a large fragment of skull
attached to a flap of the scalp.

2688
02:50:11,390 --> 02:50:15,224
The exit hole in the rear of his head
measured about 120 mm...

2689
02:50:15,519 --> 02:50:17,111
...or five inches, across.

2690
02:50:17,269 --> 02:50:21,057
Not one of the civilian doctors
who examined the President...

2691
02:50:21,647 --> 02:50:24,957
...regarded his throat wound as anything
but an entry wound.

2692
02:50:25,817 --> 02:50:29,253
But then the body was illegally moved
to Washington for the autopsy.

2693
02:50:29,486 --> 02:50:31,636
Because when a coup d'tat has occurred...

2694
02:50:31,820 --> 02:50:36,052
...there's a big difference between
an autopsy performed by civilian doctors...

2695
02:50:36,324 --> 02:50:39,714
...and one that is performed
by military doctors under orders.

2696
02:50:40,994 --> 02:50:45,829
The departure of Air Force One, Friday
afternoon was not so much a takeoff...

2697
02:50:46,122 --> 02:50:49,194
...as it was a getaway,
with the newly sworn in President.

2698
02:50:49,416 --> 02:50:50,485
Objection!

2699
02:50:50,625 --> 02:50:51,535
Sustained.

2700
02:50:51,668 --> 02:50:56,059
On the plane, the White House Situation
Room announced Oswald's guilt...

2701
02:50:56,338 --> 02:50:59,967
...to all passengers before any kind
of investigation had begun.

2702
02:51:00,382 --> 02:51:03,215
The "angry lone nut" solution
is beginning to take shape.

2703
02:51:03,426 --> 02:51:05,860
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Sustained.

2704
02:51:07,762 --> 02:51:09,639
Please bottle the acid.

2705
02:51:11,848 --> 02:51:16,524
The three Bethesda doctors picked by
the military left something to be desired.

2706
02:51:16,851 --> 02:51:20,321
None of them had experience
with combat-gunfire wounds.

2707
02:51:20,896 --> 02:51:25,208
Through their autopsy, we've been able
to justify eight wounds from two bullets.

2708
02:51:25,524 --> 02:51:27,799
Three to Kennedy, five to Connally.

2709
02:51:27,984 --> 02:51:30,214
One of them being the "magic bullet."

2710
02:51:30,486 --> 02:51:31,885
- FBI?
- Here.

2711
02:51:32,029 --> 02:51:35,658
Col. Finck, are you saying someone
told you not to dissect the neck?

2712
02:51:35,906 --> 02:51:39,057
I was told the family wanted
the examination of the head.

2713
02:51:39,951 --> 02:51:41,145
Oh, Christ.

2714
02:51:41,369 --> 02:51:43,041
Looks like half his brain is gone.

2715
02:51:43,202 --> 02:51:45,432
- Weigh it.
- 653 grams.

2716
02:51:45,621 --> 02:51:48,613
As a pathologist, it was your obligation
to explore...

2717
02:51:48,832 --> 02:51:50,629
...all possible causes of death.

2718
02:51:50,792 --> 02:51:52,305
I had the cause of death.

2719
02:51:52,459 --> 02:51:55,735
Your Honor, please direct the witness
to answer my question.

2720
02:51:56,837 --> 02:51:59,988
Why did Col. Finck not dissect
the tract of the bullet wound?

2721
02:52:00,214 --> 02:52:02,125
I heard Dr. Humes stating...

2722
02:52:02,466 --> 02:52:04,457
That's enough. That's enough.

2723
02:52:04,675 --> 02:52:06,028
It's duly noted.

2724
02:52:06,552 --> 02:52:08,144
Let's check the back.

2725
02:52:15,892 --> 02:52:18,167
I can feel the end of the wound
with my finger.

2726
02:52:18,352 --> 02:52:20,183
That won't be necessary.

2727
02:52:23,063 --> 02:52:24,542
Watch the ear!

2728
02:52:25,982 --> 02:52:28,212
Shot in the back. Cheap crime.

2729
02:52:28,608 --> 02:52:29,563
He said:

2730
02:52:29,860 --> 02:52:31,498
Who's in charge here?

2731
02:52:31,945 --> 02:52:32,980
I am.

2732
02:52:34,321 --> 02:52:35,720
I don't remember his name.

2733
02:52:36,448 --> 02:52:38,006
It was quite crowded.

2734
02:52:38,491 --> 02:52:42,086
And when you are called to look
at the wounds of the dead President...

2735
02:52:42,326 --> 02:52:45,284
...you don't ask people for their names
and who they are.

2736
02:52:45,496 --> 02:52:49,489
But you were a qualified pathologist.
Was the Army General?

2737
02:52:50,206 --> 02:52:51,002
No.

2738
02:52:51,916 --> 02:52:53,235
But you took his orders.

2739
02:52:53,959 --> 02:52:54,789
Yes.

2740
02:52:55,002 --> 02:52:57,311
- So he was directing the autopsy.
- No.

2741
02:52:57,671 --> 02:52:59,662
There were others.

2742
02:53:00,589 --> 02:53:02,068
There were admirals.

2743
02:53:04,383 --> 02:53:07,216
When you're a Lieutenant Colonel,
you follow orders.

2744
02:53:07,427 --> 02:53:11,818
It is not our business to discuss this
with anyone outside this room.

2745
02:53:12,097 --> 02:53:14,975
As I recall, Admiral Kenney,
Navy Surgeon General...

2746
02:53:15,432 --> 02:53:18,549
...specifically told us
not to discuss the case.

2747
02:53:21,520 --> 02:53:24,478
A lot of people were deciding
what was private...

2748
02:53:25,105 --> 02:53:27,573
...none of the American people's business.

2749
02:53:27,774 --> 02:53:29,765
The chief pathologist, Commander Humes...

2750
02:53:29,942 --> 02:53:33,332
...by his own admission,
voluntarily burned his autopsy notes.

2751
02:53:33,820 --> 02:53:36,493
President Johnson orders
the blood-soaked limousine...

2752
02:53:36,697 --> 02:53:40,133
...filled with bullet holes and clues
to be washed and rebuilt.

2753
02:53:40,616 --> 02:53:43,335
He sends Connally's bloody suit
to the cleaners.

2754
02:53:44,619 --> 02:53:48,407
The Justice Department denied this office
access to the autopsy photos.

2755
02:53:49,705 --> 02:53:53,903
When we finally get a court order
to examine Kennedy's brain...

2756
02:53:54,500 --> 02:53:57,810
...in the hopes of finding
from which direction the bullet came...

2757
02:53:58,045 --> 02:53:59,319
...we're told...

2758
02:54:00,213 --> 02:54:04,047
...by your government that
the President's brain has disappeared.

2759
02:54:07,635 --> 02:54:11,105
That's not all that's disappeared.
With it, the concept of justice.

2760
02:54:11,346 --> 02:54:15,703
Objection. Mr. Garrison is insulting
the federal government...

2761
02:54:16,558 --> 02:54:18,116
Overruled!

2762
02:54:25,229 --> 02:54:27,299
So, what really happened that day?

2763
02:54:27,982 --> 02:54:30,496
Let's just for a moment speculate,
shall we?

2764
02:54:31,067 --> 02:54:33,786
We have the epileptic seizure...

2765
02:54:33,986 --> 02:54:37,820
...distracting the police and allowing
the shooters to get into place.

2766
02:54:38,989 --> 02:54:42,902
The epileptic later vanished,
never checking into the hospital.

2767
02:54:44,326 --> 02:54:47,284
The A-team goes to the sixth floor
of the Depository.

2768
02:54:47,579 --> 02:54:50,616
They were refurbishing the floors
of the Depository that week...

2769
02:54:50,830 --> 02:54:53,344
...allowing unknown workmen
in the building.

2770
02:54:54,167 --> 02:54:57,523
They move quickly into position,
minutes before the shooting.

2771
02:54:58,210 --> 02:55:02,601
The second spotter, talking by radio to
the other teams, has the best overall view.

2772
02:55:03,422 --> 02:55:04,616
The God spot.

2773
02:55:05,049 --> 02:55:09,645
B-team, one rifleman and one spotter
with access to the building...

2774
02:55:10,093 --> 02:55:12,891
...moves into a low floor
of the Dal-Tex building.

2775
02:55:14,013 --> 02:55:18,564
The third team, C-team, moves in
behind the fence above the grassy knoll...

2776
02:55:19,100 --> 02:55:23,491
...where the shooter and the spotter
are first seen by the late Lee Bowers.

2777
02:55:24,437 --> 02:55:26,348
They have the best position.

2778
02:55:27,022 --> 02:55:30,014
Kennedy is close and on a flat,
low trajectory.

2779
02:55:30,691 --> 02:55:32,602
Part of this team is a coordinator...

2780
02:55:32,776 --> 02:55:36,928
...who flashed security credentials
at people, chasing them from the area.

2781
02:55:38,196 --> 02:55:41,791
Probably two to three more men
are in the crowd.

2782
02:55:42,283 --> 02:55:45,753
Ten to twelve men.
Three teams. Three shooters.

2783
02:55:46,452 --> 02:55:50,923
The triangulation of fire Clay Shaw and
David Ferrie discussed two months before.

2784
02:55:52,164 --> 02:55:53,802
They blocked the plaza.

2785
02:55:54,291 --> 02:55:56,009
They know every inch.

2786
02:55:58,001 --> 02:56:01,596
They've calibrated their sights.
Practiced on moving targets.

2787
02:56:02,879 --> 02:56:04,073
They're ready.

2788
02:56:04,964 --> 02:56:08,115
Kennedy's motorcade makes a turn
from Main onto Houston.

2789
02:56:09,217 --> 02:56:11,208
It's going to be a turkey shoot.

2790
02:56:12,970 --> 02:56:14,961
They don't shoot him on Houston...

2791
02:56:15,138 --> 02:56:18,369
...the easiest shot for a single shooter
in the Depository.

2792
02:56:18,890 --> 02:56:22,485
They wait till he gets to the killing zone
between three rifles.

2793
02:56:23,894 --> 02:56:26,852
Kennedy makes the turn
from Houston onto Elm.

2794
02:56:27,813 --> 02:56:31,044
Slowing down to some 11 miles an hour.

2795
02:56:31,900 --> 02:56:35,575
The shooters across Dealey Plaza tighten,
taking their aim.

2796
02:56:37,528 --> 02:56:41,123
Waiting for the radio to say,
"Green! Green!"

2797
02:56:41,656 --> 02:56:43,931
Or, "Abort! Abort!"

2798
02:56:50,328 --> 02:56:52,000
The first shot rings out.

2799
02:56:52,997 --> 02:56:56,034
Sounding like a backfire,
it misses the car completely.

2800
02:56:56,625 --> 02:56:59,583
Frame 161, Kennedy stops waving
as he hears something.

2801
02:57:00,253 --> 02:57:02,813
Connally's head turns slightly to the right.

2802
02:57:03,213 --> 02:57:06,967
Frame 193, the second shot hits Kennedy
in the throat from the front.

2803
02:57:07,924 --> 02:57:11,121
Frame 225, Kennedy emerges
from behind the road sign.

2804
02:57:11,593 --> 02:57:14,869
He's been hit, raising his hands
to his throat.

2805
02:57:15,679 --> 02:57:17,829
The third shot, frame 232...

2806
02:57:18,139 --> 02:57:21,529
...hits Kennedy in the back,
pulling him downward and forward.

2807
02:57:22,017 --> 02:57:25,054
Connally, you will notice,
shows no sign of being hit.

2808
02:57:25,436 --> 02:57:29,349
He is holding his Stetson, which is
impossible if his wrist is shattered.

2809
02:57:29,606 --> 02:57:31,358
Connally is turning now.

2810
02:57:31,524 --> 02:57:33,879
Frame 238. The fourth shot.

2811
02:57:34,109 --> 02:57:37,260
It misses Kennedy and takes Connally
in the back.

2812
02:57:37,694 --> 02:57:40,492
This is the shot that proves
there were two rifles.

2813
02:57:40,696 --> 02:57:44,052
Connally yells, "My God!
They're going to kill us all!"

2814
02:57:44,449 --> 02:57:47,680
Around this time,
another shot misses the car completely...

2815
02:57:47,952 --> 02:57:50,420
...striking James Teague by the underpass.

2816
02:57:51,454 --> 02:57:52,648
The car brakes.

2817
02:57:52,955 --> 02:57:54,627
The sixth and fatal shot.

2818
02:57:54,872 --> 02:57:58,182
Frame 313, takes Kennedy in the head
from the front.

2819
02:57:59,835 --> 02:58:01,427
This is the key shot.

2820
02:58:02,127 --> 02:58:05,005
The President going back and to his left...

2821
02:58:05,338 --> 02:58:07,408
...shot from the front and right.

2822
02:58:08,465 --> 02:58:11,741
Totally inconsistent with the shot
from the Depository.

2823
02:58:12,051 --> 02:58:12,961
Again.

2824
02:58:16,930 --> 02:58:18,761
Back, and to the left.

2825
02:58:20,265 --> 02:58:22,017
Back, and to the left.

2826
02:58:23,475 --> 02:58:25,193
Back, and to the left.

2827
02:58:27,645 --> 02:58:29,397
So what happens then?

2828
02:58:31,898 --> 02:58:33,092
Pandemonium.

2829
02:58:36,068 --> 02:58:37,899
Let's go! We got him!

2830
02:58:43,489 --> 02:58:48,085
The shooters quickly disassemble their
various weapons, except the Oswald rifle.

2831
02:58:59,417 --> 02:59:02,693
Patrolman Smith rushes to the parking lot
behind the fence.

2832
02:59:03,502 --> 02:59:04,855
He smells gunpowder.

2833
02:59:05,004 --> 02:59:08,599
He produced credentials showing him
to be Secret Service.

2834
02:59:09,840 --> 02:59:12,400
Let's see your ID.
See anyone else up here?

2835
02:59:13,677 --> 02:59:15,952
I accepted that and let him go.

2836
02:59:17,012 --> 02:59:19,924
I regretted it. He looked like a mechanic.

2837
02:59:20,848 --> 02:59:24,841
He had on a sports shirt and pants,
but he had dirty fingernails.

2838
02:59:26,852 --> 02:59:29,650
Afterward, it didn't ring true.
But at the time...

2839
02:59:29,854 --> 02:59:31,810
...we were so pressed for time.

2840
02:59:32,773 --> 02:59:35,651
All Secret Servicemen
in Dallas are accounted for.

2841
02:59:36,567 --> 02:59:39,684
None were on foot in Dealey Plaza
before or after the shooting...

2842
02:59:39,903 --> 02:59:43,612
...till the Dallas Secret Service chief
returned at 12:55.

2843
02:59:44,530 --> 02:59:48,205
The Dallas police took at least 12 people
into custody.

2844
02:59:49,368 --> 02:59:50,926
No record of their arrest.

2845
02:59:51,077 --> 02:59:54,592
Men acting like hoboes
were pulled off trains...

2846
02:59:54,955 --> 02:59:57,344
...marched through Dealey Plaza,
photographed.

2847
02:59:57,540 --> 02:59:59,690
Yet there's no record of their arrest.

2848
02:59:59,874 --> 03:00:03,469
Men identifying themselves
as Secret Service agents were everywhere.

2849
03:00:04,544 --> 03:00:06,500
But who was impersonating them?

2850
03:00:06,879 --> 03:00:08,392
Where was Oswald?

2851
03:00:09,131 --> 03:00:13,204
Around 12: 15, leaving the building
to see the motorcade...

2852
03:00:13,467 --> 03:00:16,425
...Carolyn Arnold sees Oswald
in the second-floor snack room...

2853
03:00:16,636 --> 03:00:18,786
...where he said he went for a Coke.

2854
03:00:19,554 --> 03:00:22,671
He was in a booth on the right side
of the room.

2855
03:00:23,307 --> 03:00:26,822
He was by himself as usual,
appeared to be having lunch.

2856
03:00:27,309 --> 03:00:30,187
I didn't speak to him,
but I recognized him clearly.

2857
03:00:30,646 --> 03:00:35,117
At the same time, Bonnie Ray Williams is
supposedly eating lunch in the sixth floor.

2858
03:00:35,816 --> 03:00:38,569
He's there until 12: 15, maybe 12:20.

2859
03:00:39,443 --> 03:00:40,956
He sees nobody.

2860
03:00:41,652 --> 03:00:45,930
Arnold Rowlands, on the street, looks up,
sees two men in the sixth-floor windows...

2861
03:00:46,197 --> 03:00:49,553
...presumably after Williams
finished his lunch and left.

2862
03:00:50,325 --> 03:00:54,079
John Powell, a prisoner on the sixth floor
of the county jail, sees them.

2863
03:00:54,328 --> 03:00:55,727
Many of us saw them.

2864
03:00:55,870 --> 03:00:59,658
Everyone was hollering and yelling.
We thought they was security guys.

2865
03:01:00,499 --> 03:01:04,936
If Oswald was the assassin, he was
nonchalant about moving into position.

2866
03:01:05,753 --> 03:01:09,189
Later, he told police he was
in the second-floor snack room.

2867
03:01:09,630 --> 03:01:12,667
Probably told to wait there
by his handler for a call.

2868
03:01:14,425 --> 03:01:16,416
But the phone call never came.

2869
03:01:17,093 --> 03:01:19,653
Maximum 90 seconds
after Kennedy is shot...

2870
03:01:19,846 --> 03:01:23,634
...Patrolman Marrion Baker sees Oswald
in that second-floor lunchroom.

2871
03:01:25,266 --> 03:01:26,858
Is this man an employee?

2872
03:01:27,018 --> 03:01:29,691
Yes. The President's been shot.

2873
03:01:29,894 --> 03:01:31,850
The Commission would have us believe...

2874
03:01:32,021 --> 03:01:35,411
...that after firing three bolt-action shots
in 5.6 seconds...

2875
03:01:36,023 --> 03:01:40,335
...Oswald then leaves three cartridges
neatly side-by-side in the firing nest...

2876
03:01:40,693 --> 03:01:45,084
...wipes fingerprints off the rifle,
stashes it on the other side of the loft...

2877
03:01:46,281 --> 03:01:48,511
...sprints down five flights of stairs...

2878
03:01:48,699 --> 03:01:52,055
...past Victoria Adams and Sandra Styles
who never see him...

2879
03:01:52,951 --> 03:01:57,263
...then shows up, cool and calm, on the
second floor in front of Patrolman Baker.

2880
03:01:58,956 --> 03:02:02,028
All this within a maximum of 90 seconds
of the shooting.

2881
03:02:02,875 --> 03:02:04,831
Is this man an employee?

2882
03:02:05,001 --> 03:02:06,992
Yes. The President's been shot.

2883
03:02:07,211 --> 03:02:08,690
Is he out of breath?

2884
03:02:09,212 --> 03:02:11,680
According to Baker, absolutely not.

2885
03:02:12,131 --> 03:02:16,886
Assuming he is the sole assassin,
Oswald is free to leave the building.

2886
03:02:17,718 --> 03:02:21,950
The longer he delays, the more chance
the building will be sealed by police.

2887
03:02:22,972 --> 03:02:26,203
Is he guilty? Does he walk
out the nearest staircase?

2888
03:02:28,475 --> 03:02:30,113
He buys a Coke...

2889
03:02:30,435 --> 03:02:34,508
...and at a slow pace, spotted by Mrs. Reid
on the second floor...

2890
03:02:35,063 --> 03:02:37,497
...he strolls out
the more distant front exit...

2891
03:02:37,690 --> 03:02:39,282
...where cops have gathered.

2892
03:02:39,441 --> 03:02:42,399
Odd, since three shots were fired
from there...

2893
03:02:42,610 --> 03:02:45,488
...nobody seals the Depository
for ten more minutes.

2894
03:02:45,988 --> 03:02:48,786
Oswald slips out,
as do several other employees.

2895
03:02:49,240 --> 03:02:53,153
When he realized something had gone
wrong and Kennedy had been killed...

2896
03:02:53,826 --> 03:02:57,614
...he knew there was a problem.
Maybe even that he was the patsy.

2897
03:02:58,246 --> 03:03:02,285
An intuition, maybe. The President killed
in spite of his warning.

2898
03:03:02,541 --> 03:03:04,418
The phone call that never came.

2899
03:03:04,584 --> 03:03:07,781
Perhaps fear now came to Oswald
for the very first time.

2900
03:03:09,504 --> 03:03:12,655
Oswald returns to his rooming house
around 1:00 p. M...

2901
03:03:12,881 --> 03:03:15,190
...a half hour after the assassination.

2902
03:03:15,508 --> 03:03:17,146
A man shot the President!

2903
03:03:17,301 --> 03:03:20,179
He puts on his jacket,
grabs his.38 revolver...

2904
03:03:20,428 --> 03:03:22,259
...and leaves at 1:04.

2905
03:03:22,929 --> 03:03:25,921
Earlene Roberts, the housekeeper,
heard two beeps on a car horn.

2906
03:03:26,140 --> 03:03:29,530
Two uniformed cops pulled up
while Oswald was in his room.

2907
03:03:29,767 --> 03:03:31,280
Like it was a signal.

2908
03:03:32,436 --> 03:03:36,714
Officer Tippit is shot between 1: 10
and 1: 15, a mile away.

2909
03:03:37,022 --> 03:03:39,536
And though no one saw him walking...

2910
03:03:39,857 --> 03:03:42,576
...the government says
Oswald covered that distance.

2911
03:03:42,777 --> 03:03:45,211
Giving the government the benefit
of the doubt...

2912
03:03:45,403 --> 03:03:48,395
...Oswald would've had to jog a mile
in six to eleven minutes...

2913
03:03:48,614 --> 03:03:51,287
...then commit the murder,
reverse his direction...

2914
03:03:51,490 --> 03:03:54,402
...and walk three-fifths of a mile
to the Texas Theater...

2915
03:03:54,618 --> 03:03:57,086
...and arrive sometime before 1:30.

2916
03:04:02,623 --> 03:04:04,261
It's also a useful conclusion.

2917
03:04:04,416 --> 03:04:06,850
After all, why would Oswald
kill Officer Tippit...

2918
03:04:07,043 --> 03:04:10,080
...unless he just shot the President
and feared arrest?

2919
03:04:10,795 --> 03:04:12,547
Domingo Benevides...

2920
03:04:14,215 --> 03:04:16,365
...the closest witness to the shooting...

2921
03:04:16,550 --> 03:04:20,623
...refused to identify Oswald as the killer
and was never taken to a lineup.

2922
03:04:21,261 --> 03:04:22,376
Acquilla Clemons...

2923
03:04:22,511 --> 03:04:26,220
...saw the killer and another man
go off in separate directions.

2924
03:04:26,723 --> 03:04:30,238
Mrs. Clemons was never taken to a lineup
or to the Warren Commission.

2925
03:04:31,018 --> 03:04:34,897
At the scene, Officer Poe marks
his initials on the shells...

2926
03:04:35,187 --> 03:04:37,303
...to record the chain of evidence.

2927
03:04:37,772 --> 03:04:40,570
Those initials are not
on the three cartridge cases...

2928
03:04:40,774 --> 03:04:43,163
...which the Warren Commission show him.

2929
03:04:43,609 --> 03:04:47,397
As early as 12:44, only 14 minutes
after the assassination...

2930
03:04:48,112 --> 03:04:52,105
...the police put out a description
matching Oswald's size and build.

2931
03:04:52,949 --> 03:04:57,625
Oswald is next seen by a shoe salesman,
Johnny Brewer, on Jefferson Avenue.

2932
03:04:58,577 --> 03:05:03,014
Oswald is scared. He begins to realize
the full implications of this thing.

2933
03:05:03,289 --> 03:05:06,918
He goes to the Texas Theater,
possibly a prearranged meeting point.

2934
03:05:07,375 --> 03:05:11,891
Though he has $14 in his pocket,
he doesn't buy the $0.75 ticket.

2935
03:05:12,420 --> 03:05:14,615
Brewer has the cashier call the police.

2936
03:05:14,797 --> 03:05:16,867
In response to that call...

2937
03:05:17,382 --> 03:05:21,534
...at least 30 officers in patrol cars descend
on the movie theater.

2938
03:05:22,052 --> 03:05:25,249
This is the most remarkable example
of police intuition...

2939
03:05:25,555 --> 03:05:27,625
...since the Reichstag fire.

2940
03:05:28,473 --> 03:05:29,701
I don't buy it!

2941
03:05:29,891 --> 03:05:33,884
They knew. Someone knew
Oswald would be there.

2942
03:05:34,645 --> 03:05:36,954
Brewer leads the cops into the theater...

2943
03:05:37,146 --> 03:05:39,182
...and from the stage, points Oswald out.

2944
03:05:39,356 --> 03:05:40,391
There he is.

2945
03:05:52,823 --> 03:05:55,098
Sir, can I get you to stand up?

2946
03:06:01,079 --> 03:06:05,436
I am not resisting arrest!
I am not resisting arrest!

2947
03:06:05,749 --> 03:06:07,228
They have their man.

2948
03:06:08,292 --> 03:06:11,045
It's already been decided in Washington.

2949
03:06:11,961 --> 03:06:14,395
When he is brought from the theater...

2950
03:06:14,796 --> 03:06:17,071
...a crowd is waiting to scream at him.

2951
03:06:17,424 --> 03:06:20,814
Lee Oswald must have felt like Joseph K.
In Kafka's The Trial.

2952
03:06:21,092 --> 03:06:23,322
He's never given reasons for his arrest.

2953
03:06:23,511 --> 03:06:26,548
He doesn't know the unseen forces
ranging against him.

2954
03:06:27,180 --> 03:06:30,775
At police headquarters, he was booked
for murdering Tippit.

2955
03:06:31,099 --> 03:06:32,851
No legal counsel was provided.

2956
03:06:33,017 --> 03:06:35,087
No record made of the questioning.

2957
03:06:35,352 --> 03:06:37,946
When the sun rises the next morning...

2958
03:06:38,187 --> 03:06:40,701
...he is booked for murdering the President.

2959
03:06:40,897 --> 03:06:44,685
The whole country, fueled by the media,
assumes he is guilty.

2960
03:06:45,442 --> 03:06:47,637
Under the guise of a patriotic club owner...

2961
03:06:47,819 --> 03:06:51,095
...out to spare Jackie Kennedy
from testifying at a trial...

2962
03:06:51,947 --> 03:06:54,336
...Jack Ruby is let into a garage...

2963
03:06:54,532 --> 03:06:57,330
...by one of his inside men
on the police force.

2964
03:06:58,326 --> 03:07:02,001
Oswald is brought out
like a sacrificial lamb...

2965
03:07:02,287 --> 03:07:05,324
...and nicely disposed of as an enemy
of the people.

2966
03:07:24,094 --> 03:07:25,971
Who grieves for Lee Harvey Oswald...

2967
03:07:26,971 --> 03:07:29,724
...buried in a cheap grave
under the name Oswald?

2968
03:07:30,931 --> 03:07:31,886
Nobody.

2969
03:07:39,646 --> 03:07:44,197
False statements and press leaks
about Oswald circulate the globe.

2970
03:07:45,567 --> 03:07:48,684
The official legend is created
and the media takes it from there.

2971
03:07:50,362 --> 03:07:54,150
The glitter of official lies
and the epic splendor of JFK's funeral...

2972
03:07:54,406 --> 03:07:57,603
...confuse the eye
and confound the understanding.

2973
03:07:59,034 --> 03:08:00,433
Hitler said:

2974
03:08:01,077 --> 03:08:04,194
"The bigger the lie,
the more people will believe it."

2975
03:08:05,705 --> 03:08:09,095
Lee Harvey Oswald, a crazed,
lonely man who wanted attention...

2976
03:08:09,332 --> 03:08:13,689
...and got it by killing a President
was only the first in a long line of patsies.

2977
03:08:14,587 --> 03:08:17,420
In later years, Bobby Kennedy,
Martin Luther King...

2978
03:08:17,630 --> 03:08:20,190
...men whose commitment
to change and peace...

2979
03:08:20,382 --> 03:08:23,818
...made them dangerous to men
committed to war, would follow...

2980
03:08:24,510 --> 03:08:27,308
...also killed by such lonely, crazed men.

2981
03:08:28,345 --> 03:08:32,463
Men who remove all guilt by making
murder a meaningless act of a loner.

2982
03:08:33,975 --> 03:08:38,127
We've all become Hamlets in our country,
children of a slain father-leader...

2983
03:08:38,436 --> 03:08:40,904
...whose killers still possess the throne.

2984
03:08:41,230 --> 03:08:44,779
The ghost of John F. Kennedy confronts us
with the secret murder...

2985
03:08:45,023 --> 03:08:47,173
...at the heart of the American Dream.

2986
03:08:47,358 --> 03:08:51,636
He forces on us the appalling questions:
Of what is our Constitution made?

2987
03:08:52,654 --> 03:08:54,849
What are our lives worth?

2988
03:08:55,031 --> 03:08:56,942
What is the future of a democracy...

2989
03:08:57,116 --> 03:09:01,234
...where a President can be assassinated
under suspicious circumstances...

2990
03:09:01,493 --> 03:09:04,644
...while the machinery of legal action
scarcely trembles?

2991
03:09:05,913 --> 03:09:09,269
How many more political murders
disguised as heart attacks...

2992
03:09:09,666 --> 03:09:12,100
...suicides, cancers, drug overdoses?

2993
03:09:12,292 --> 03:09:14,852
How many plane and car crashes
will occur...

2994
03:09:15,127 --> 03:09:17,687
...before they are exposed
for what they are?

2995
03:09:19,464 --> 03:09:22,376
"Treason doth never prosper,"
wrote an English poet.

2996
03:09:23,175 --> 03:09:24,654
"What's the reason?

2997
03:09:25,426 --> 03:09:28,065
"For if it prosper,
none dare call it treason."

2998
03:09:28,804 --> 03:09:31,762
The American public has yet
to see the Zapruder film.

2999
03:09:32,431 --> 03:09:33,466
Why?

3000
03:09:34,015 --> 03:09:38,054
The American public has yet to see
the real X-rays and autopsy photographs.

3001
03:09:38,310 --> 03:09:39,186
Why?

3002
03:09:40,270 --> 03:09:43,342
Hundreds of documents could help prove
this conspiracy.

3003
03:09:43,564 --> 03:09:46,636
Why are they being withheld
or burned by the government?

3004
03:09:47,775 --> 03:09:52,212
When my office or you, the people, asked
those questions, demanded evidence...

3005
03:09:52,487 --> 03:09:56,241
...the answer from on high
has always been: National security.

3006
03:09:57,490 --> 03:10:01,529
What kind of national security do we have
when we're robbed of our leaders?

3007
03:10:02,201 --> 03:10:04,556
What national security
permits the removal...

3008
03:10:04,745 --> 03:10:07,134
...of fundamental power from the people...

3009
03:10:07,330 --> 03:10:11,084
...and validates the ascendancy
of an invisible government in the US?

3010
03:10:12,583 --> 03:10:14,494
That kind of national security is...

3011
03:10:14,668 --> 03:10:18,058
...when it smells like it, feels like it,
and looks like it...

3012
03:10:18,838 --> 03:10:20,556
...you call it what it is:

3013
03:10:21,006 --> 03:10:22,234
Fascism!

3014
03:10:24,466 --> 03:10:29,301
I submit to you that what took place
on November 22, 1963...

3015
03:10:29,636 --> 03:10:31,194
...was a coup d'tat.

3016
03:10:32,013 --> 03:10:34,163
Its most direct and tragic result...

3017
03:10:34,515 --> 03:10:38,349
...was the reversal of Kennedy's decision
to withdraw from Vietnam.

3018
03:10:39,852 --> 03:10:42,320
The war is the biggest business
in America...

3019
03:10:42,521 --> 03:10:44,591
...worth $80 billion a year.

3020
03:10:45,814 --> 03:10:48,487
President Kennedy was murdered
by a conspiracy...

3021
03:10:48,691 --> 03:10:51,489
...planned at the highest levels
of our government...

3022
03:10:51,694 --> 03:10:55,130
...carried out by fanatical
and disciplined cold warriors...

3023
03:10:55,446 --> 03:10:58,802
...in the Pentagon and CIA's
covert-operation apparatus.

3024
03:10:59,032 --> 03:11:01,546
Among them, Clay Shaw, here before you.

3025
03:11:02,492 --> 03:11:05,564
It was a public execution,
and it was covered up by...

3026
03:11:05,787 --> 03:11:08,665
...like-minded people in the Dallas Police...

3027
03:11:08,914 --> 03:11:12,031
...the Secret Service, the FBI,
and the White House...

3028
03:11:12,249 --> 03:11:15,958
...up to and including J. Edgar Hoover,
and Lyndon Johnson...

3029
03:11:16,585 --> 03:11:18,894
...who were accomplices after the fact.

3030
03:11:19,587 --> 03:11:23,421
The assassination reduced the President
to a transient official.

3031
03:11:24,299 --> 03:11:29,373
His job is to speak as often as possible
of the nation's desire for peace...

3032
03:11:30,136 --> 03:11:32,775
...while he acts as a business agent
in the Congress...

3033
03:11:32,971 --> 03:11:34,927
...for the military and their contractors.

3034
03:11:37,391 --> 03:11:39,427
Some people say I'm crazy.

3035
03:11:41,018 --> 03:11:43,851
Southern caricature seeking higher office.

3036
03:11:46,148 --> 03:11:49,026
There's a simple way to determine
if I am paranoid.

3037
03:11:49,358 --> 03:11:52,191
Ask the two men who profited most
from the assassination...

3038
03:11:52,401 --> 03:11:56,155
...former President Johnson
and your new President, Nixon...

3039
03:11:56,488 --> 03:12:01,004
...to release the 51 CIA documents
pertaining to Lee Oswald and Jack Ruby.

3040
03:12:02,116 --> 03:12:03,754
Or the secret CIA memo...

3041
03:12:03,951 --> 03:12:08,183
...on Oswald's activities in Russia that
was destroyed while being photocopied.

3042
03:12:08,537 --> 03:12:10,255
These documents are yours.

3043
03:12:10,997 --> 03:12:13,272
The people's property. You pay for it.

3044
03:12:14,166 --> 03:12:16,316
But as the government sees you
as children...

3045
03:12:16,501 --> 03:12:19,573
...who might be too disturbed
to face this reality...

3046
03:12:20,379 --> 03:12:23,018
...or because you might lynch
those involved...

3047
03:12:24,089 --> 03:12:27,126
...you cannot see these documents
for another 75 years.

3048
03:12:28,301 --> 03:12:29,893
I'm in my 40s...

3049
03:12:31,177 --> 03:12:33,896
...so I'll have "shuffled off
this mortal coil" by then.

3050
03:12:34,097 --> 03:12:38,409
But I'm telling my eight-year-old son
to keep himself physically fit...

3051
03:12:39,475 --> 03:12:43,229
...so that one glorious September morning,
in 2038...

3052
03:12:43,520 --> 03:12:48,469
...he can go to the National Archives
and learn what the CIA and FBI knew.

3053
03:12:50,065 --> 03:12:51,896
They may push it back then.

3054
03:12:52,067 --> 03:12:56,822
It may become a generational affair.
Questions passed from parent to child.

3055
03:12:57,446 --> 03:13:01,200
But someday, somewhere,
someone may find out the damn truth.

3056
03:13:02,450 --> 03:13:03,519
We better.

3057
03:13:04,701 --> 03:13:08,376
Or we might just as well build ourselves
another government...

3058
03:13:08,828 --> 03:13:12,980
...like the Declaration of Independence
says to, when the old one don't work.

3059
03:13:13,373 --> 03:13:15,011
Just a bit farther out West.

3060
03:13:16,918 --> 03:13:18,795
An American naturalist wrote:

3061
03:13:19,211 --> 03:13:22,283
"A patriot must always be ready
to defend his country...

3062
03:13:22,671 --> 03:13:24,502
"...against its government."

3063
03:13:26,216 --> 03:13:28,332
I'd hate to be in your shoes today.

3064
03:13:29,092 --> 03:13:33,131
You have a lot to think about. You've seen
evidence the public hasn't seen.

3065
03:13:34,929 --> 03:13:37,238
Going back to when we were children...

3066
03:13:38,057 --> 03:13:42,608
...I think most of us in this courtroom
thought justice came automatically.

3067
03:13:44,019 --> 03:13:45,975
That virtue was its own reward.

3068
03:13:46,146 --> 03:13:48,057
That good triumphs over evil.

3069
03:13:49,314 --> 03:13:52,033
But as we get older
we know this isn't true.

3070
03:13:53,109 --> 03:13:57,102
Individual human beings have to create
justice, and this is not easy...

3071
03:13:58,737 --> 03:14:01,695
...because the truth often poses a threat
to power...

3072
03:14:02,240 --> 03:14:05,710
...and one often has to fight power
at great risk to themselves.

3073
03:14:06,075 --> 03:14:07,906
People like S.M. Holland...

3074
03:14:08,577 --> 03:14:09,896
...Lee Bowers...

3075
03:14:10,454 --> 03:14:12,092
...Jean Hill, Willie O'Keefe...

3076
03:14:12,247 --> 03:14:15,398
...have all taken that risk
and they've all come forward.

3077
03:14:15,707 --> 03:14:18,585
I have here some $8,000 in these letters...

3078
03:14:19,668 --> 03:14:21,818
...sent from all over the country.

3079
03:14:22,295 --> 03:14:24,855
Quarters, dimes, dollars from housewives...

3080
03:14:25,631 --> 03:14:28,350
...plumbers, car salesmen,
teachers, invalids.

3081
03:14:29,675 --> 03:14:32,747
These are people who cannot afford
to send money but do.

3082
03:14:34,011 --> 03:14:35,763
People who drive cabs...

3083
03:14:36,388 --> 03:14:37,946
...who nurse in hospitals...

3084
03:14:38,098 --> 03:14:40,612
...who see their kids go to Vietnam.

3085
03:14:41,891 --> 03:14:42,926
Why?

3086
03:14:44,518 --> 03:14:45,951
Because they care.

3087
03:14:46,936 --> 03:14:49,086
Because they want to know the truth.

3088
03:14:49,731 --> 03:14:51,767
Because they want their country back.

3089
03:14:51,941 --> 03:14:54,011
Because it still belongs to us...

3090
03:14:54,442 --> 03:14:58,355
...as long as the people have the guts
to fight for what they believe in.

3091
03:15:00,863 --> 03:15:05,015
The truth is the most important value
we have, because if it doesn't endure...

3092
03:15:05,949 --> 03:15:07,780
...if the government murders truth...

3093
03:15:07,951 --> 03:15:10,146
...if we cannot respect these people...

3094
03:15:10,328 --> 03:15:15,163
...then this is not the country I was born in,
or the country I want to die in.

3095
03:15:17,249 --> 03:15:18,477
Tennyson wrote:

3096
03:15:18,625 --> 03:15:20,695
"Authority forgets a dying king."

3097
03:15:22,544 --> 03:15:25,058
This was never more true
than for John F. Kennedy...

3098
03:15:25,255 --> 03:15:28,725
...whose murder was probably one
of the most terrible moments...

3099

...in the history of our country.

3100
03:15:33,844 --> 03:15:37,678
We, the people, the jury system sitting
in judgment on Clay Shaw...

3101
03:15:39,682 --> 03:15:41,320
...represent the hope...

3102
03:15:41,474 --> 03:15:43,863
...of humanity against government power.

3103
03:15:45,310 --> 03:15:47,062
In discharging your duty...

3104
03:15:47,853 --> 03:15:50,970
...to bring a first conviction
in this house of cards...

3105

...against Clay Shaw...

3106
03:15:53,775 --> 03:15:58,212
"...ask not what your country can do for
you but what you can do for your country."

3107
03:15:58,986 --> 03:16:00,419
Do not forget...

3108
03:16:01,155 --> 03:16:02,873
...your dying king.

3109
03:16:04,490 --> 03:16:06,003
Show this world...

3110
03:16:06,533 --> 03:16:11,163
...this is still a government "of the people,
for the people and by the people."

3111
03:16:13,996 --> 03:16:15,873
Nothing as long as you live...

3112
03:16:16,039 --> 03:16:17,995
...will ever be more important.

3113
03:16:21,251 --> 03:16:22,570
It's up to you.

3114
03:16:45,809 --> 03:16:47,879
Has the jury reached a verdict?

3115
03:16:48,520 --> 03:16:49,714
We have, Your Honor.

3116
03:16:49,854 --> 03:16:52,163
Please hand the verdict to the clerk.

3117
03:17:01,862 --> 03:17:04,137
Will the defendant please rise?

3118
03:17:08,367 --> 03:17:10,517
The clerk will now read the verdict.

3119
03:17:11,369 --> 03:17:15,044
"New Orleans, Louisiana. March 1, 1969.

3120
03:17:16,038 --> 03:17:20,668
"We, the jury, find the defendant,
Clay Shaw, not guilty."

3121
03:17:42,515 --> 03:17:44,187
We believe there was a conspiracy.

3122
03:17:44,349 --> 03:17:47,227
Whether Shaw was a part of it
is another kettle of fish.

3123
03:17:47,435 --> 03:17:48,834
There's Jim!

3124
03:17:51,438 --> 03:17:56,193
Do you agree that this is a full vindication
of the Warren Commission?

3125
03:17:58,151 --> 03:18:01,143
It only proves you cannot run
an investigation...

3126
03:18:01,528 --> 03:18:05,965
...questioning the intelligence operations
of the US government.

3127
03:18:06,239 --> 03:18:09,470
People claim you're unfit to hold office...

3128
03:18:09,909 --> 03:18:12,139
...that you've ruined
Clay Shaw's reputation.

3129
03:18:12,327 --> 03:18:13,726
Are you going to resign?

3130
03:18:13,869 --> 03:18:17,339
Hell, no! I'm going to run again,
and I'm going to win!

3131
03:18:17,956 --> 03:18:19,787
Who will you persecute next?

3132
03:18:19,957 --> 03:18:22,915
If it takes me 30 years to nail every one
of the assassins...

3133
03:18:23,126 --> 03:18:25,481
...then I will continue for 30 years!

3134
03:18:26,628 --> 03:18:29,426
I owe that to Jack Kennedy
and the country.

3135
03:18:29,630 --> 03:18:31,860
There's Clay! There's Clay Shaw!

3136
03:18:32,507 --> 03:18:35,897
- How does it feel to be acquitted?
- It's been exhausting.

3137
03:18:36,135 --> 03:18:37,250
What'll you do now?

3138
03:18:37,385 --> 03:18:39,057
I'm going home and cook some touffe.

3139
03:18:39,220 --> 03:18:40,539
Were you confident about the outcome?

3140
03:18:43,890 --> 03:18:47,280
- Do you think Garrison will be back?
- I'm sure he will.
