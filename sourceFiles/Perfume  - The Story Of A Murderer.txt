00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
English subs for a YIFY brrip
Perfume.The.Story.Of.A.Murderer.2006.720p.x264.YIFY

2
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,106
Quick.

3
00:01:31,356 --> 00:01:33,149
We can't hold them back much longer.

4
00:01:36,528 --> 00:01:37,153
Hurry.

5
00:01:40,991 --> 00:01:42,033
- Come on!
- Get up!

6
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,001
Quick!

7
00:01:56,756 --> 00:01:57,382
Faster!

8
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:12,397
Open the doors. Come on, quickly!

9
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,260
Just read them the sentence.

10
00:02:46,306 --> 00:02:50,185
The sentence of the court
is that in two days hence

11
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:54,522
the perfumer journeyman
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille

12
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:57,942
shall be bound to a wooden cross

13
00:02:58,401 --> 00:03:00,570
with his face raised toward heaven.

14
00:03:03,156 --> 00:03:05,075
And whilst still alive

15
00:03:05,617 --> 00:03:08,870
be dealt twelve blows
with an iron rod

16
00:03:11,498 --> 00:03:14,501
breaking the joints of his arms,

17
00:03:15,585 --> 00:03:17,128
his shoulders,

18
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:19,172
his hips,

19
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:20,799
his legs.

20
00:03:23,134 --> 00:03:27,263
He shall then be raised up
to hang until dead

21
00:03:27,972 --> 00:03:30,642
and all customary acts of mercy

22
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:33,478
are expressly forbidden
the executioner.

23
00:03:43,196 --> 00:03:45,365
<i>In 18th-century France,</i>

24
00:03:45,657 --> 00:03:47,492
<i>there lived a man who was
one of the most gifted</i>

25
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:50,662
<i>and notorious personages
of his time.</i>

26
00:03:52,038 --> 00:03:54,624
<i>His name was
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille,</i>

27
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:58,253
<i>and if his name has been
forgotten today, it is</i>

28
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,841
<i>for the reason that his ambition
was restricted to a domain</i>

29
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:05,510
<i>that leaves no trace in history:</i>

30
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:13,393
<i>To the fleeting realm of scent.</i>

31
00:04:27,782 --> 00:04:29,451
<i>In the period of which we speak,</i>

32
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:32,162
<i>there reigned
in the cities a stench</i>

33
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:35,081
<i>barely conceivable to us
modern men and women.</i>

34
00:04:36,499 --> 00:04:39,294
<i>Naturally, the stench
was foulest in Paris,</i>

35
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:42,047
<i>for Paris was
the largest city in Europe.</i>

36
00:04:42,964 --> 00:04:46,634
<i>And nowhere in Paris was that
stench more profoundly repugnant</i>

37
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:48,845
<i>than in the city's fish market.</i>

38
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:53,224
Here we are.
I'll get another box.

39
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:58,772
<i>It was here, then, on the most
putrid spot in the whole kingdom,</i>

40
00:04:59,022 --> 00:05:00,857
<i>that Jean-Baptiste Grenouille</i>

41
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:03,777
<i>was born
on the 17th of July, 1738.</i>

42
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:31,054
<i>It was his mother's fifth birth.</i>

43
00:05:31,221 --> 00:05:33,807
<i>She'd delivered them all here
under her fishstand,</i>

44
00:05:33,973 --> 00:05:37,018
<i>and all had been stillbirths,
or semi-stillbirths,</i>

45
00:05:37,185 --> 00:05:38,228
You all right?

46
00:05:39,104 --> 00:05:43,274
<i>And the whole mess was shoveled
with the fishguts into the river.</i>

47
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:46,111
<i>It would be
much the same today</i>

48
00:05:47,487 --> 00:05:48,613
<i>but then,</i>

49
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:51,992
<i>Jean-Baptiste chose differently.</i>

50
00:06:25,942 --> 00:06:26,985
What's that noise?

51
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:30,238
- It's a baby.
- What's going on here?

52
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:36,286
It's a newborn.

53
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,121
Where's its mother?

54
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:40,915
She was just here.

55
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:46,004
She tried to kill it.
Her own child.

56
00:06:46,796 --> 00:06:48,715
She tried to kill her baby!

57
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:51,885
There! There she is!

58
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:53,762
Stop! Stop where you are!

59
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:54,888
Murderer!

60
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,975
<i>Thus, the first sound
to escape Grenouille's lips</i>

61
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:01,394
<i>sent his mother to the gallows</i>

62
00:07:05,065 --> 00:07:07,651
<i>and Jean-Baptiste,
by official order,</i>

63
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:10,779
<i>to the orphanage
of Madame Gaillard.</i>

64
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:16,326
How many today?

65
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:18,662
Four. Well, three and a half.

66
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,086
As usual, more dead than alive.

67
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:28,004
Just take the money and sign.

68
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:37,889
Make room.

69
00:07:39,474 --> 00:07:41,309
- Where?
- Move!

70
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:45,063
Go on, now.

71
00:07:56,282 --> 00:07:57,158
Is it dead?

72
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:26,771
That's not staying in my bed.

73
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:29,941
- Let's throw it out, then.
- What if it screams?

74
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:32,319
Let's just kill it.

75
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:53,214
Harder! Push!

76
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:56,509
What are you doing?

77
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:10,023
<i>For Mme Gaillard, Grenouille was a
source of income, like any other.</i>

78
00:09:10,857 --> 00:09:12,067
<i>The children, however,
sensed at once</i>

79
00:09:12,817 --> 00:09:16,321
<i>that there was something
different about him.</i>

80
00:09:33,254 --> 00:09:37,425
<i>By the age of five, Jean-Baptiste
still could not talk.</i>

81
00:09:38,927 --> 00:09:43,098
<i>But he was born with a talent that
made him unique among mankind.</i>

82
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:48,872
<i>It was not that the other
children hated him,</i>

83
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,959
<i>they felt unnerved by him.</i>

84
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:01,343
<i>Increasingly he became aware that
his phenomenal sense of smell</i>

85
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:05,096
<i>was a gift that had been
given to him, and him alone.</i>

86
00:11:14,314 --> 00:11:17,400
<i>When Jean-Baptiste
did finally learn to speak</i>

87
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:20,904
<i>he soon found that everyday
language proved inadequate</i>

88
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:25,075
<i>for all the olfactory experiences
accumulating within himself.</i>

89
00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:30,830
Wood.

90
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:38,338
Warm wood.

91
00:11:40,006 --> 00:11:40,799
Grass.

92
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:43,968
Wet grass.

93
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:45,553
Stones.

94
00:11:46,513 --> 00:11:47,722
Warm stones.

95
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,476
Water.

96
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:55,230
Cold water.

97
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,321
Frog.

98
00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:07,033
Wet stones.

99
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:11,496
Big, wet frog stones.

100
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:14,290
Something.

101
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,836
Something.

102
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:19,713
Something.

103
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,011
<i>By 13, Mme Gaillard no longer
had room for Jean-Baptiste</i>

104
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:28,555
<i>and therefore
decided to sell him.</i>

105
00:12:28,722 --> 00:12:29,347
Come on.

106
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:34,060
Ten francs.

107
00:12:36,312 --> 00:12:39,482
<i>From his first breath of the odor
enveloping this man...</i>

108
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:41,860
<i>Seven, and not one sou more.</i>

109
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:44,904
<i>... Grenouille knew that
his life in Grimal's tannery</i>

110
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:48,199
<i>would be worth precisely as much
as the work he could accomplish.</i>

111
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:54,372
<i>Unfortunately for Madame Gaillard,</i>

112
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:00,378
<i>the bargain was short-lived.</i>

113
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:10,430
<i>Life expectancy in the tannery
was a mere five years</i>

114
00:13:11,306 --> 00:13:14,976
<i>but Jean-Baptiste proved to be
as tough as a resilient bacterium.</i>

115
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,354
<i>He adjusted to his new fate</i>

116
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,774
<i>and became a paragon
of docility and diligence.</i>

117
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,903
<i>Slaved 15, 16 hours a day,
summer and winter.</i>

118
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:30,533
<i>Gradually he became aware
of a world beyond the tannery,</i>

119
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,081
<i>where a Utopia of unexplored
smells lay in store for him.</i>

120
00:14:01,064 --> 00:14:01,690
Grenouille!

121
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:09,280
Come with us. I'm taking you
to town for delivery.

122
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:13,076
<i>Jean-Baptiste Grenouille
had triumphed.</i>

123
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,577
<i>He was alive</i>

124
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:18,748
<i>and at last he was
in his element.</i>

125
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,331
<i>He was not choosy.</i>

126
00:15:00,957 --> 00:15:05,128
<i>He did not differentiate between
what are good smells from bad,</i>

127
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,590
<i>at least not yet.</i>

128
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,720
<i>He was very greedy.</i>

129
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:19,100
<i>The goal was to possess everything
the world had to offer in odors.</i>

130
00:15:21,102 --> 00:15:25,106
<i>His only condition being,
that they were new ones.</i>

131
00:15:28,068 --> 00:15:31,571
<i>Thousands upon thousands of odors
formed an invisible gruel</i>

132
00:15:31,738 --> 00:15:35,867
<i>which he dissected into its
most remote parts and pieces.</i>

133
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,010
Grenouille!

134
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,015
Come on!

135
00:16:03,853 --> 00:16:04,521
Get your ass over here!

136
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:11,027
He needs two dozen skins
by next week. Can you do that?

137
00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:14,531
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, come with me.

138
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,431
What is it called?

139
00:17:21,765 --> 00:17:24,851
"Amor and Psyche", madame.
My latest creation.

140
00:17:25,852 --> 00:17:27,312
May I try it?

141
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:29,814
If you'll allow me, mademoiselle.

142
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,574
Sheer heaven!

143
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,456
Monsieur Pelissier,
you are truly an artiste.

144
00:19:23,386 --> 00:19:26,139
Please, take them.
I've got far too many.

145
00:20:15,689 --> 00:20:16,690
What do you want?

146
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:27,075
Want to buy some?

147
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:42,382
Two for a sou.

148
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:58,967
Next time you run off like that,
I'll kill you!

149
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:05,765
<i>That night, he could not sleep.</i>

150
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:11,730
<i>The intoxicating power of the
girl's scent made it clear to him</i>

151
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:16,067
<i>why he'd come to his own life
so tenaciously, so savagely.</i>

152
00:27:17,694 --> 00:27:21,865
<i>The purpose of his miserable
existence had a higher destiny.</i>

153
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,202
<i>He would learn
how to preserve scent</i>

154
00:27:26,828 --> 00:27:30,623
<i>so that never again would he
lose such sublime beauty.</i>

155
00:27:55,398 --> 00:27:58,860
<i>There were about a dozen
perfumers in Paris in those days.</i>

156
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:04,282
<i>One of them, the once-celebrated
Italian perfumer, Giuseppe Baldini,</i>

157
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:07,994
<i>had set up shop in the center of
the bridge called Pont au Change</i>

158
00:28:08,161 --> 00:28:11,247
<i>on his arrival in Paris
over thirty years ago.</i>

159
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:16,086
<i>To be sure, at one time in
his youth, Baldini had created</i>

160
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:20,382
<i>several truly great perfumes,
to which he owed his fortune.</i>

161
00:28:22,092 --> 00:28:24,552
<i>But now Baldini was</i>

162
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:26,846
<i>out of touch, out of fashion,</i>

163
00:28:27,013 --> 00:28:30,767
<i>and spent his days waiting for
customers that no longer came.</i>

164
00:28:32,686 --> 00:28:34,688
- Chénier! There you are!
- Monsieur Baldini.

165
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:35,939
Put on your wig.

166
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:38,316
Put on your wig!

167
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,695
You going out?

168
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:44,531
I wish to retire to my study
for a few hours

169
00:28:44,698 --> 00:28:47,200
and do not want to be disturbed
under any circumstances.

170
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:48,994
Will you be creating a new
perfume, Monsieur Baldini?

171
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,163
Correct. For Count Verhamont.

172
00:28:52,872 --> 00:28:56,543
He has asked for something like...
I think he said it was called

173
00:28:57,377 --> 00:29:01,548
Amor and Psyche from that swindler
in the Rue Saint André des Arts.

174
00:29:02,132 --> 00:29:02,757
Pelissier?

175
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,260
Pelissier, that's him.

176
00:29:07,137 --> 00:29:08,638
Amor and Psyche!

177
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,311
Do you know it?

178
00:29:14,477 --> 00:29:17,397
Oh, yes. You can smell it
everywhere these days, monsieur.

179
00:29:18,732 --> 00:29:19,983
On every street corner.

180
00:29:21,484 --> 00:29:24,612
In fact, I just
purchased you a sample.

181
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,074
In case you wanted to test it.

182
00:29:31,453 --> 00:29:34,289
What on earth makes you think I'd
be interested in testing it?

183
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,918
You're right.
It's nothing special.

184
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:42,297
Actually
it's a very common scent.

185
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:45,675
I believe the head chord
contains lime oil.

186
00:29:47,802 --> 00:29:51,097
Really? And the heart chord?

187
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:53,892
Orange blossom, I believe.

188
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:57,479
And civet in the base chord,

189
00:29:57,646 --> 00:29:59,189
but, you know,
I cannot say for sure.

190
00:29:59,356 --> 00:30:02,233
Well, I couldn't care less
what that bungler Pelissier

191
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,694
- slops into his perfumes.
- Naturally not, monsieur.

192
00:30:05,528 --> 00:30:08,573
And I am thinking of creating
something for Count Verhamont

193
00:30:09,449 --> 00:30:11,910
that will cause
a veritable sensation.

194
00:30:13,203 --> 00:30:14,954
I'm sure it will,
Monsieur Baldini.

195
00:30:16,164 --> 00:30:19,751
Take charge of the shop, Chénier,
and don't let anyone come near me.

196
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:23,046
Inspiration requires
peace and tranquility.

197
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,090
Is there anything else you need?

198
00:31:08,383 --> 00:31:10,010
Inspiration, perhaps.

199
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,845
Ah, my Giuseppe.

200
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,975
You are still
the great perfumer Baldini.

201
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:13,782
Wonderful.

202
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,663
He did it again.

203
00:32:27,462 --> 00:32:28,797
Lime oil.

204
00:32:32,425 --> 00:32:33,760
Orange blossom,

205
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:35,345
to be sure.

206
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,935
And a hint of cloves, perhaps.

207
00:32:44,187 --> 00:32:44,938
No.

208
00:32:47,107 --> 00:32:48,149
Or could be cinnamon?

209
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:51,528
It's gone.

210
00:32:55,782 --> 00:32:56,408
Cinnamon.

211
00:32:57,951 --> 00:32:58,827
It's not cinnamon.

212
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:03,873
Cloves.

213
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:05,125
No.

214
00:33:06,334 --> 00:33:07,210
Musk?

215
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:08,044
No.

216
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,253
Who's there?

217
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:52,380
I'm from Grimal's tannery.

218
00:33:55,925 --> 00:33:57,552
I've got the goatskins
you ordered.

219
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:04,809
Follow me.

220
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:12,025
This way.

221
00:34:46,935 --> 00:34:47,602
There.

222
00:34:48,478 --> 00:34:49,270
Lay them there.

223
00:34:59,114 --> 00:35:01,449
Tell your master
that the skins are fine.

224
00:35:01,616 --> 00:35:03,827
I'll come by in the next
few days and pay for them.

225
00:35:05,161 --> 00:35:05,954
Yes, Monsieur.

226
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:15,005
You want to make this leather
smell good, don't you?

227
00:35:16,923 --> 00:35:18,675
Why, of course and so it shall.

228
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:21,428
With Amor & Psyche
by Pelissier?

229
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:30,228
Whatever gave you the absurd idea
I would use someone else's perfume?

230
00:35:31,313 --> 00:35:32,605
It's all over you.

231
00:35:33,189 --> 00:35:35,317
It's on your forehead,
your nose, your hands...

232
00:35:35,483 --> 00:35:37,569
It's bad, Amor & Psyche
is, Master.

233
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:39,279
There's too much rosemary in it.

234
00:35:39,446 --> 00:35:40,613
And too much of...

235
00:35:42,324 --> 00:35:44,117
that and that.

236
00:35:47,454 --> 00:35:50,540
Bergamot and Patchouli?

237
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,416
Pat...?

238
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:53,501
Patchouli.

239
00:35:53,835 --> 00:35:54,711
Patchouli.

240
00:36:00,467 --> 00:36:01,092
What else?

241
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:05,889
That and that.

242
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:09,267
That and that.

243
00:36:19,486 --> 00:36:20,695
Orange blossom,

244
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,156
lime...

245
00:36:24,741 --> 00:36:25,992
- Rosemary.
- Musk.

246
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,122
And cloves?

247
00:36:31,581 --> 00:36:32,290
And this.

248
00:36:41,758 --> 00:36:44,094
- Storax?
- That's in it too.

249
00:36:44,344 --> 00:36:47,305
- Storax.
- Storax.

250
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:57,190
You have, it appears,
a fine nose, young man.

251
00:36:57,357 --> 00:36:59,651
My nose knows all the smells
in the world.

252
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:02,654
It's the best nose in Paris,
only I don't know the names.

253
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:04,280
I need to learn the names,
learn them all...

254
00:37:04,447 --> 00:37:05,573
No, no, no!

255
00:37:05,782 --> 00:37:07,492
You dont interrupt me
when I'm speaking.

256
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,619
You are both impertinent
and insolent.

257
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:12,956
Even I don't know every scent.

258
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:18,795
I've, of course, known for some time
the ingredients of Amor & Psyche.

259
00:37:18,962 --> 00:37:23,008
But all it needs to find that out is
a passably fine nose, nothing else.

260
00:37:25,051 --> 00:37:28,054
But it needs the craft
of a true perfumer

261
00:37:29,097 --> 00:37:30,890
to detect the exact formula,

262
00:37:31,641 --> 00:37:33,476
which notes, which chords,

263
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:35,979
and in what precise measurements.

264
00:37:37,731 --> 00:37:40,775
Could you tell me the exact
formula of Amor & Psyche?

265
00:37:43,653 --> 00:37:44,863
Best-nose-in-Paris!

266
00:37:50,618 --> 00:37:51,328
Speak up!

267
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:54,289
You see, you can't. Can you?

268
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:56,082
And I'll tell you why.

269
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:00,003
Because talent means
next to nothing,

270
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:05,050
while experience acquired

271
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,678
in humility and hard work
means everything.

272
00:38:13,516 --> 00:38:15,644
I don't know what a formula is,

273
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,647
but I can make Amor & Psyche
for you now.

274
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:23,610
And you think ljust let you
slop around in my laboratory

275
00:38:23,777 --> 00:38:25,904
with essential oils
that are worth a fortune?

276
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:26,863
You?

277
00:38:28,031 --> 00:38:28,657
Yes.

278
00:38:29,157 --> 00:38:30,367
Now pay attention!

279
00:38:33,995 --> 00:38:35,538
What is your name, anyway?

280
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:39,250
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.

281
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:44,130
Very well,
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille,

282
00:38:46,633 --> 00:38:49,678
you shall have the opportunity now
to prove your assertion.

283
00:38:50,011 --> 00:38:52,847
Your grandiose failure will also
be an opportunity for you

284
00:38:53,223 --> 00:38:54,891
to learn the virtue of humility.

285
00:38:55,058 --> 00:38:58,019
- How much do you want me to make?
- How much of what...?

286
00:38:58,395 --> 00:38:59,980
How much Amor & Psyche do you want?

287
00:39:02,899 --> 00:39:04,275
Shall I fill this flask?

288
00:39:04,693 --> 00:39:06,444
No! You shall not!

289
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:17,330
You may fill this one.

290
00:39:17,664 --> 00:39:18,623
Yes, Master.

291
00:39:22,252 --> 00:39:23,670
But, Master Baldini...

292
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:27,215
You must let me do it in my own way.

293
00:39:27,882 --> 00:39:28,883
As you please.

294
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:35,598
No!

295
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:40,437
Don't drop it. That's pure alcohol.
You want to blow up the building?

296
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,025
You have to measure it first!

297
00:40:33,782 --> 00:40:35,617
Stop, stop it!

298
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:37,327
That's enough!

299
00:40:37,827 --> 00:40:38,953
You know nothing!

300
00:40:39,663 --> 00:40:42,207
Essential oils are always
to be mixed first,

301
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:44,250
then the alcohol added

302
00:40:44,459 --> 00:40:47,462
and never ever is perfume
to be shaken like that!

303
00:40:47,962 --> 00:40:50,882
I must have been insane to listen
to your asinine gibberish!

304
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:54,386
It's all done.

305
00:41:40,974 --> 00:41:42,267
This is Amor & Psyche!

306
00:41:44,019 --> 00:41:45,979
But it's not
a good perfume, Master.

307
00:41:47,856 --> 00:41:51,067
If you let me again, Master,
I'll make it more better.

308
00:43:06,476 --> 00:43:08,478
Now it's a really good perfume.

309
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:17,696
Don't you want
to smell it, Master?

310
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:19,864
I'm not in the mood
to test it now.

311
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:22,409
I have other things
on my mind. Go now.

312
00:43:24,744 --> 00:43:26,538
- But, Master...
- Go! Now!

313
00:43:42,262 --> 00:43:44,389
Can I come to work
for you, master? Can I?

314
00:43:47,309 --> 00:43:48,601
Let me think about it.

315
00:43:48,768 --> 00:43:49,394
Master!

316
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:54,524
I have to learn
how to keep smell!

317
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:56,609
What?

318
00:43:58,194 --> 00:43:59,529
Can you teach me that?

319
00:44:00,947 --> 00:44:02,741
I shall have to think
about it. Now, go.

320
00:44:49,704 --> 00:44:50,580
I love you.

321
00:44:57,712 --> 00:44:59,839
I'll give you 50 francs for him.

322
00:45:07,597 --> 00:45:08,431
Grenouille!

323
00:45:09,474 --> 00:45:11,768
<i>Grimal's transaction</i>

324
00:45:11,935 --> 00:45:14,354
<i>had a profound effect
on all three parties.</i>

325
00:45:18,024 --> 00:45:20,694
<i>Not least upon
Monsieur Grimal himself.</i>

326
00:45:23,905 --> 00:45:27,367
<i>As for Giuseppe Baldini,
the acquisition of Grenouille</i>

327
00:45:27,534 --> 00:45:30,829
<i>miraculously transformed
his dwindling business</i>

328
00:45:30,996 --> 00:45:33,665
<i>even surpassing its former glory.</i>

329
00:45:42,007 --> 00:45:43,800
<i>While at last, for Jean-Baptiste,</i>

330
00:45:43,967 --> 00:45:46,553
<i>the mysterious secrets
of the perfumer's craft</i>

331
00:45:47,137 --> 00:45:48,763
<i>began to unfold.</i>

332
00:45:55,061 --> 00:45:57,731
Now, pay careful attention
to what I tell you.

333
00:45:57,897 --> 00:46:01,067
Just like a musical chord,
a perfume chord contains

334
00:46:01,234 --> 00:46:02,402
four essences

335
00:46:02,569 --> 00:46:06,406
or notes, carefully selected
for their harmonic affinity.

336
00:46:06,698 --> 00:46:09,534
Each perfume contains three chords:

337
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:11,703
The head, the heart and the base,

338
00:46:12,287 --> 00:46:14,581
necessitating twelve notes in all.

339
00:46:15,498 --> 00:46:17,500
The head chord contains

340
00:46:17,667 --> 00:46:20,211
the first impression,
lasting a few minutes

341
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:22,422
before giving way
to the heart chord,

342
00:46:22,589 --> 00:46:26,009
the theme of the perfume,
lasting several hours.

343
00:46:26,176 --> 00:46:28,511
Finally, the base chord,

344
00:46:29,304 --> 00:46:32,599
the trail of the perfume,
lasting several days.

345
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:40,357
Mind you, the ancient Egyptians
believed that one can only create

346
00:46:40,523 --> 00:46:44,444
a truly original perfume
by adding an extra note,

347
00:46:44,986 --> 00:46:48,573
one final essence
that will ring out

348
00:46:49,491 --> 00:46:51,368
and dominate the others.

349
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,249
Legend has it that an amphora
was once found in a pharaoh's tomb

350
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:02,504
and when it was opened
a perfume was released.

351
00:47:02,671 --> 00:47:05,632
After all those thousands of years,

352
00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:09,803
a perfume of such subtle
beauty and yet such power,

353
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:12,514
that for one single moment

354
00:47:12,681 --> 00:47:16,851
every person on earth believed
they were in paradise.

355
00:47:19,145 --> 00:47:21,606
Twelve essences could be identified,

356
00:47:22,816 --> 00:47:24,109
but the 13th,

357
00:47:25,318 --> 00:47:26,444
the vital one,

358
00:47:28,488 --> 00:47:30,365
could never be determined.

359
00:47:32,325 --> 00:47:33,118
Why not?

360
00:47:35,662 --> 00:47:37,789
Why not?
What do you mean, why not?

361
00:47:39,332 --> 00:47:41,918
Because it's a legend, numbskull!

362
00:47:43,169 --> 00:47:44,462
What's a legend?

363
00:47:47,048 --> 00:47:47,882
Never mind.

364
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,176
Jean-Baptiste.

365
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,636
Jean-Baptiste?

366
00:48:38,892 --> 00:48:40,018
What's the matter?

367
00:48:40,602 --> 00:48:41,269
Master,

368
00:48:42,187 --> 00:48:44,481
I have to learn
how to capture scent.

369
00:48:47,442 --> 00:48:48,652
What are you talking about?

370
00:48:49,194 --> 00:48:51,905
I have to learn
how to capture scent

371
00:48:52,072 --> 00:48:53,490
and reprise it forever.

372
00:48:54,157 --> 00:48:55,367
You mean, preserve.

373
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,077
You have to teach me that.

374
00:48:57,827 --> 00:48:59,245
All right.
Calm down, my boy.

375
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:00,747
Calm down.

376
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:02,999
We have work to do.

377
00:49:05,251 --> 00:49:07,587
"The soul of beings is their scent."

378
00:49:08,963 --> 00:49:10,340
You said that, master.

379
00:49:12,008 --> 00:49:12,717
Did I?

380
00:49:13,593 --> 00:49:15,679
I will make you
as many perfumes as you want

381
00:49:15,887 --> 00:49:17,472
but you have to teach me

382
00:49:17,847 --> 00:49:19,975
how to capture
the smell of all things.

383
00:49:21,768 --> 00:49:22,686
Can you do that?

384
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,523
Well, naturally.

385
00:49:26,856 --> 00:49:28,775
Then teach me
everything you know

386
00:49:32,404 --> 00:49:34,781
and I'll make you the best
perfume in the whole world.

387
00:49:53,049 --> 00:49:54,968
Imagine, Jean-Baptiste,

388
00:49:55,135 --> 00:49:58,179
ten thousand roses to produce

389
00:49:58,346 --> 00:50:01,391
one single ounce of essential oil.

390
00:50:04,894 --> 00:50:08,648
Now, keep the air flowing or the
bottom petals will begin to stew

391
00:50:09,858 --> 00:50:13,403
while I set up the alembic.
And take care not to damage them.

392
00:50:13,695 --> 00:50:16,823
We have to let them go to their
deaths with their scent intact.

393
00:50:36,051 --> 00:50:36,801
Perfect.

394
00:50:37,927 --> 00:50:39,512
Now, help me
with the Moor's head.

395
00:50:52,859 --> 00:50:54,402
Temperature is vital.

396
00:50:54,569 --> 00:50:58,281
When the quicksilver is here,
the heat is precisely correct

397
00:50:58,448 --> 00:51:01,076
and the oil will gradually rise.

398
00:51:03,703 --> 00:51:07,832
Note this mechanism is a remarkable
invention of my own devising.

399
00:51:08,667 --> 00:51:11,503
You will observe how cold water

400
00:51:12,128 --> 00:51:14,756
is pumped through here

401
00:51:17,133 --> 00:51:20,428
allowing the essence
to condense here

402
00:51:20,595 --> 00:51:24,683
until it finally appears

403
00:51:26,726 --> 00:51:27,519
here.

404
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:32,107
Of course,
out on the hillside above Grasse

405
00:51:32,273 --> 00:51:34,985
we had only to bellow
pure, fresh air.

406
00:51:36,444 --> 00:51:39,531
Ah, Grasse. What a town.

407
00:51:41,491 --> 00:51:43,201
The Rome of scents.

408
00:51:44,536 --> 00:51:46,955
The Promised Land of perfume.

409
00:51:48,665 --> 00:51:52,836
No man can rightly
call himself a perfumer

410
00:51:53,378 --> 00:51:57,549
unless he has proved his worth
in that hallowed place.

411
00:52:00,302 --> 00:52:02,804
Not to worry.
Happens all the time.

412
00:52:04,806 --> 00:52:05,557
To Grasse.

413
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:24,868
Master.

414
00:52:26,578 --> 00:52:27,203
Look.

415
00:52:33,168 --> 00:52:35,128
The very soul of the rose.

416
00:53:29,724 --> 00:53:30,475
Jean-Baptiste.

417
00:53:34,312 --> 00:53:35,063
What's wrong?

418
00:53:37,107 --> 00:53:38,108
Jean-Baptiste.

419
00:53:41,528 --> 00:53:42,612
What have you done?

420
00:53:43,363 --> 00:53:45,323
- You lied.
- What?

421
00:53:46,366 --> 00:53:47,283
You lied to me.

422
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:51,413
How dare you talk to me like that.

423
00:53:52,831 --> 00:53:55,583
You said I could capture
the scent of anything.

424
00:53:56,459 --> 00:53:57,627
And so you can.

425
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:03,216
What do you smell?

426
00:54:04,509 --> 00:54:05,635
What do you smell?

427
00:54:11,182 --> 00:54:11,891
Nothing.

428
00:54:15,478 --> 00:54:17,355
What were you expecting to smell?

429
00:54:17,689 --> 00:54:18,523
Glass.

430
00:54:19,774 --> 00:54:21,359
But glass doesn't smell.

431
00:54:21,776 --> 00:54:23,570
Course it does.
What's this?

432
00:54:29,075 --> 00:54:30,452
I don't smell a thing.

433
00:54:31,661 --> 00:54:33,538
It should smell like copper!

434
00:54:33,788 --> 00:54:34,539
Enough!

435
00:54:37,834 --> 00:54:41,212
You were trying to distill
the smell of copper?

436
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:44,841
Iron? Glass? Copper?

437
00:54:49,262 --> 00:54:50,722
What else did you try?

438
00:54:54,684 --> 00:54:55,644
No!

439
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:00,065
Have you gone completely insane?

440
00:55:00,982 --> 00:55:02,942
You told me I had to experiment.

441
00:55:03,777 --> 00:55:05,904
Experiment? Experiment?

442
00:55:06,613 --> 00:55:08,531
But not with the cat.

443
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:13,620
What kind of a human being are you?

444
00:55:14,537 --> 00:55:15,997
Don't you know anything?

445
00:55:16,581 --> 00:55:18,667
You can no more distill
the scent of a cat

446
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:20,794
than you can distill
the scent of you or me.

447
00:55:32,055 --> 00:55:32,847
I can't?

448
00:55:33,264 --> 00:55:34,391
Of course not!

449
00:55:42,315 --> 00:55:43,858
<i>He is in stadio ultimo.</i>

450
00:55:44,025 --> 00:55:45,360
- What?
- He's dying.

451
00:55:45,694 --> 00:55:47,237
Is there nothing you can do?

452
00:55:47,696 --> 00:55:50,907
- I fear not.
- No! He cannot die.

453
00:55:51,408 --> 00:55:53,368
Well, my fee is 50 francs.

454
00:55:53,535 --> 00:55:54,661
50 francs?

455
00:55:54,828 --> 00:55:57,789
You charlatan!
You can't even name the disease!

456
00:56:01,835 --> 00:56:03,712
No! Jean-Baptiste!

457
00:56:06,256 --> 00:56:07,674
You cannot do this to me.

458
00:56:08,717 --> 00:56:12,887
Not now. Not yet.

459
00:56:24,733 --> 00:56:25,567
Is there

460
00:56:30,822 --> 00:56:32,032
any other way

461
00:56:34,284 --> 00:56:37,078
to preserve smell
besides distill it?

462
00:56:37,537 --> 00:56:38,747
Jean-Baptiste?

463
00:56:44,294 --> 00:56:45,462
Is there, master?

464
00:56:47,047 --> 00:56:50,050
Well, yes, I believe there is.

465
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,761
What is it?

466
00:56:55,597 --> 00:56:59,267
It is known as the mysterious
art of enfleurage.

467
00:57:02,228 --> 00:57:03,188
Can you teach me?

468
00:57:07,108 --> 00:57:09,903
Not even I am intimate
with its secrets.

469
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:15,325
But could I learn it in Grasse?

470
00:57:16,576 --> 00:57:19,245
- Well...
- Could I?

471
00:57:25,669 --> 00:57:27,462
Where else but in Grasse?

472
00:57:35,136 --> 00:57:37,555
<i>Within a week Grenouille
was well again,</i>

473
00:57:37,722 --> 00:57:41,893
<i>but to travel to Grasse to find
ajob he needed journey papers.</i>

474
00:57:43,478 --> 00:57:45,230
<i>Baldini agreed to provide them</i>

475
00:57:45,605 --> 00:57:47,482
<i>on condition that
Grenouille left him</i>

476
00:57:47,649 --> 00:57:51,111
<i>not less than one hundred
formulas for new perfumes.</i>

477
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:56,074
<i>Grenouille did not mind. He
could have given him a thousand.</i>

478
00:58:02,372 --> 00:58:06,334
<i>The morning of Grenouille's
departure, Baldini was pleased.</i>

479
00:58:06,626 --> 00:58:10,505
<i>At last, he felt rewarded for
his many years of hard work.</i>

480
00:58:11,298 --> 00:58:14,134
<i>He could not remember
a happier day.</i>

481
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:17,971
<i>Deeply satisfied,
he went back to sleep</i>

482
00:58:18,138 --> 00:58:20,890
<i>and awoke no more in this life.</i>

483
00:58:40,577 --> 00:58:44,748
<i>With every step he took from
the city, the happier he felt.</i>

484
00:58:45,832 --> 00:58:50,003
<i>The air above him grew
clearer, purer, cleaner,</i>

485
00:58:50,754 --> 00:58:53,798
<i>and at last he was able
to breathe freely.</i>

486
00:58:57,552 --> 00:58:59,929
<i>There were two ways
to reach Grasse.</i>

487
00:59:00,847 --> 00:59:04,059
<i>The first followed the winding
roads through the villages</i>

488
00:59:04,225 --> 00:59:08,355
<i>while the second lead across
the mountains, down into Provence.</i>

489
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:12,525
<i>The choice was quite easy.</i>

490
00:59:16,905 --> 00:59:19,157
<i>Thus his nose led him
ever higher,</i>

491
00:59:19,366 --> 00:59:21,660
<i>ever further from mankind,</i>

492
00:59:22,577 --> 00:59:26,748
<i>more towards the magnetic pole of
the greatest possible solitude.</i>

493
01:00:06,538 --> 01:00:10,291
<i>Grenouille needed a moment to
believe that he had actually found</i>

494
01:00:10,458 --> 01:00:14,045
<i>a spot on earth where scent
was almost absent.</i>

495
01:00:19,426 --> 01:00:23,596
<i>Spread all around lay nothing but
the tranquil scent of dead stone.</i>

496
01:00:27,309 --> 01:00:29,769
<i>There was something sacred
about this place.</i>

497
01:00:34,149 --> 01:00:36,943
<i>No longer distracted
by anything external,</i>

498
01:00:37,485 --> 01:00:41,323
<i>he was finally able to bask
in his own existence</i>

499
01:00:43,867 --> 01:00:45,660
<i>and found it splendid.</i>

500
01:00:54,502 --> 01:00:58,256
<i>After a while, he almost forgot
his plans and obsessions</i>

501
01:01:00,342 --> 01:01:03,470
<i>and, indeed, might have done
so altogether.</i>

502
01:01:18,693 --> 01:01:19,444
Hello?

503
01:01:24,115 --> 01:01:24,866
Hello?

504
01:01:28,203 --> 01:01:28,953
Hello?

505
01:01:47,472 --> 01:01:50,266
<i>There were a thousand
smells in his clothes.</i>

506
01:01:50,433 --> 01:01:53,228
<i>The smell of sand,
stone, moss.</i>

507
01:01:53,395 --> 01:01:56,606
<i>Even the smell of the sausage
he'd eaten weeks ago.</i>

508
01:01:56,773 --> 01:01:58,942
<i>Only one smell was not there.</i>

509
01:02:02,195 --> 01:02:03,321
<i>His own.</i>

510
01:02:40,775 --> 01:02:44,946
<i>For the first time, Grenouille
realized he had no smell.</i>

511
01:02:47,532 --> 01:02:51,536
<i>He realized that all his life
he had been a nobody to everyone.</i>

512
01:02:52,579 --> 01:02:56,166
<i>What he now felt was the fear
of his own oblivion.</i>

513
01:02:57,375 --> 01:03:00,712
<i>It was as though
he did not exist.</i>

514
01:03:06,551 --> 01:03:10,680
<i>By the first light of next morning,
Grenouille had a new plan.</i>

515
01:03:11,306 --> 01:03:13,475
<i>He must continue
his journey to Grasse.</i>

516
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,979
<i>There he would teach the world
not only that he existed,</i>

517
01:03:18,146 --> 01:03:19,898
<i>that he was someone,</i>

518
01:03:20,273 --> 01:03:22,275
<i>but that he was exceptional.</i>

519
01:03:26,696 --> 01:03:28,073
<i>And with this decision</i>

520
01:03:29,032 --> 01:03:32,702
<i>it seemed that the gods had
at last begun to smile on him.</i>

521
01:04:55,201 --> 01:04:56,244
Go in.

522
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:01,346
Laura?

523
01:08:09,938 --> 01:08:10,563
Laura?

524
01:08:11,898 --> 01:08:12,774
Coming, Papa.

525
01:08:50,478 --> 01:08:52,397
Haven't seen you here before.

526
01:08:54,357 --> 01:08:55,817
It's my first season.

527
01:08:57,444 --> 01:08:59,237
Picking together
is always more fun.

528
01:09:01,156 --> 01:09:02,866
They say you pick
everything you find.

529
01:09:47,702 --> 01:09:48,328
Idiot!

530
01:09:48,995 --> 01:09:51,289
How many times have I told you
not to cram the blossoms in

531
01:09:51,498 --> 01:09:54,876
like you're stuffing a chicken?

532
01:09:55,126 --> 01:09:56,878
Watch how Grenouille does it.

533
01:09:59,047 --> 01:10:01,216
Look how skillfully
he handles them.

534
01:10:01,716 --> 01:10:05,428
The whole art of enfleurage is
to allow the flowers to die slowly.

535
01:10:05,595 --> 01:10:07,722
In their sleep, as it were.

536
01:10:07,889 --> 01:10:12,018
Handle them as you would a lady.
Wouldn't you agree with me, Druot?

537
01:10:12,936 --> 01:10:14,104
If you say so, Madame.

538
01:10:17,399 --> 01:10:19,651
You. Check the jonquil blossoms.

539
01:10:23,697 --> 01:10:24,781
They need more time.

540
01:10:27,909 --> 01:10:29,160
Do what I say!

541
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:14,706
Stop it!

542
01:11:16,124 --> 01:11:16,958
I'm not in the mood.

543
01:11:17,667 --> 01:11:18,543
Are you sure?

544
01:11:20,003 --> 01:11:21,379
Of course I'm sure.

545
01:11:28,303 --> 01:11:29,512
I said...

546
01:11:32,515 --> 01:11:33,475
...no!

547
01:11:45,195 --> 01:11:46,279
Suit yourself

548
01:11:50,116 --> 01:11:50,784
Lucien?

549
01:11:55,038 --> 01:11:56,331
Fetch me back the ladder.

550
01:11:56,581 --> 01:11:57,666
Fetch it yourself.

551
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:10,595
Lucien?

552
01:12:14,557 --> 01:12:15,392
Lucien!

553
01:12:26,903 --> 01:12:27,529
Lucien?

554
01:12:31,324 --> 01:12:31,950
Lucien?

555
01:12:51,511 --> 01:12:52,137
Lucien?

556
01:13:50,445 --> 01:13:54,324
Tuberoses for Madame Arnulfi.
She here?

557
01:13:58,286 --> 01:13:58,995
She's busy.

558
01:14:07,087 --> 01:14:08,880
Seems such a waste to boil them.

559
01:14:10,757 --> 01:14:12,300
Or whatever you do with them.

560
01:14:17,973 --> 01:14:19,474
So what do you do with them?

561
01:14:21,059 --> 01:14:22,936
Warm them in animal fat.

562
01:14:23,395 --> 01:14:26,982
- What for?
- The fat soaks up their scent.

563
01:14:27,774 --> 01:14:28,650
Then what?

564
01:14:31,361 --> 01:14:33,571
Then I cool it to a pomade

565
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:39,035
and then I filter it before...

566
01:14:43,748 --> 01:14:44,666
Before what?

567
01:14:46,001 --> 01:14:48,920
Before I add in alcohol and
other essences to make a perfume.

568
01:14:49,087 --> 01:14:50,005
Don't touch anything.

569
01:14:56,261 --> 01:14:57,137
What's in there?

570
01:14:58,680 --> 01:14:59,514
Nothing. Just flowers.

571
01:15:01,016 --> 01:15:02,267
- Can I look?
- No.

572
01:15:02,851 --> 01:15:04,102
Not now. I've got work to do.

573
01:15:04,394 --> 01:15:05,312
You must go now.

574
01:15:05,478 --> 01:15:07,814
- Come on. Let me look.
- Don't touch.

575
01:15:07,981 --> 01:15:09,149
Ah, my tuberoses.

576
01:15:11,026 --> 01:15:12,319
Morning, Madame.

577
01:15:12,861 --> 01:15:13,570
Morning.

578
01:15:17,282 --> 01:15:19,117
Why have you covered the tank?

579
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:22,078
It's an experiment, Madame.

580
01:15:25,373 --> 01:15:27,584
To protect the blossoms
from daylight.

581
01:15:28,209 --> 01:15:29,878
To preserve the scent better.

582
01:15:31,212 --> 01:15:32,964
Well, if you say so.

583
01:15:34,883 --> 01:15:38,053
Come with me. I'll settle
your master's account.

584
01:15:40,764 --> 01:15:43,183
To preserve
their scent better, you say?

585
01:15:57,489 --> 01:15:58,782
I don't smell much.

586
01:16:05,413 --> 01:16:08,917
No. Then my experiment
was a failure.

587
01:16:12,796 --> 01:16:15,840
Make sure it's your time
you're wasting, not ours.

588
01:16:28,728 --> 01:16:30,021
How much must I pay

589
01:16:32,816 --> 01:16:34,025
to be with you?

590
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,528
Depends what you want.

591
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:51,459
What's that stuff?

592
01:16:55,755 --> 01:16:57,215
I'm creating a perfume.

593
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,137
Lie down, please.

594
01:17:22,157 --> 01:17:23,283
It feels horrible.

595
01:17:24,909 --> 01:17:28,288
It's only animal fat.
To soak up your scent.

596
01:17:29,247 --> 01:17:31,041
Creating a perfume, eh?

597
01:17:31,708 --> 01:17:35,003
Admit it. You're getting
some sort of bang out of this.

598
01:17:36,004 --> 01:17:36,921
Aren't you?

599
01:17:38,173 --> 01:17:39,382
I enjoy my work.

600
01:17:41,509 --> 01:17:42,844
Hold your arm still.

601
01:17:51,394 --> 01:17:52,854
Don't think
you're gonna tie me up.

602
01:17:54,397 --> 01:17:55,982
Hold out your arm, please.

603
01:18:04,115 --> 01:18:05,825
I've come across some
strange men in my time...

604
01:18:06,076 --> 01:18:08,828
Just relax.

605
01:18:16,836 --> 01:18:18,797
Holy Mother, what's that?!

606
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:23,927
Just for scraping off the fat.

607
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:27,347
- Are you mad?
- Relax. You'll ruin everything.

608
01:18:28,765 --> 01:18:32,394
If you're frightened, you stink.
Then your perfume will be spoiled.

609
01:18:32,644 --> 01:18:34,187
I've had enough.

610
01:18:35,271 --> 01:18:37,774
Here, take your money.

611
01:18:38,817 --> 01:18:42,195
Basting me up in all this goo.
You think I am a Christmas goose?

612
01:18:42,487 --> 01:18:43,697
Get out of here!

613
01:22:10,487 --> 01:22:13,823
Quickly, blow them out
before the roses melt!

614
01:22:14,032 --> 01:22:16,326
- Roses can't melt, Papa!
- These ones can.

615
01:22:31,549 --> 01:22:35,720
Now I'd like to propose a toast
to our guest of honour,

616
01:22:35,971 --> 01:22:38,306
his Excellency,
the Marquis de Montesquieu.

617
01:22:39,015 --> 01:22:41,685
May our trade
continue to flourish!

618
01:22:47,107 --> 01:22:48,108
I thank you all

619
01:22:48,733 --> 01:22:51,486
and would ask of you
the honour to be the first

620
01:22:51,653 --> 01:22:54,072
to offer my congratulations
to your beautiful daughter

621
01:22:54,406 --> 01:22:57,242
and present her with a small
token of my affection.

622
01:23:04,749 --> 01:23:05,583
It's beautiful.

623
01:23:23,518 --> 01:23:25,103
I'm overwhelmed, your Grace.

624
01:23:25,603 --> 01:23:26,479
"Your Grace"?

625
01:23:27,814 --> 01:23:31,109
I had hoped that we would be
on more familiar terms by now.

626
01:23:34,487 --> 01:23:36,197
Let's have a game
of hide-and-seek!

627
01:23:36,364 --> 01:23:38,950
Oh yes! But everyone must play!

628
01:23:41,202 --> 01:23:43,288
Let the men catch the women.

629
01:23:50,462 --> 01:23:51,963
Albine! Wait!

630
01:25:21,553 --> 01:25:23,847
Put me down. Please?

631
01:25:28,935 --> 01:25:30,562
Now there's no escape.

632
01:26:01,217 --> 01:26:03,053
Game's over, everybody.

633
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:06,222
Laura?

634
01:26:08,308 --> 01:26:09,643
Time to go in now.

635
01:26:34,376 --> 01:26:35,210
Laura?

636
01:26:53,937 --> 01:26:56,439
Albine? Françoise?

637
01:27:02,195 --> 01:27:04,114
Laura, have you seen the twins?

638
01:27:05,031 --> 01:27:06,741
No, not since the game started.

639
01:27:09,619 --> 01:27:11,746
Albine? Françoise?

640
01:27:22,799 --> 01:27:24,926
Albine? Françoise?

641
01:27:25,093 --> 01:27:25,719
Jacques?

642
01:27:27,512 --> 01:27:28,555
Take this way.

643
01:27:29,347 --> 01:27:30,765
You two with me.

644
01:27:30,932 --> 01:27:34,519
Your Excellency? Through here.

645
01:27:39,733 --> 01:27:41,568
Albine! Françoise!

646
01:28:53,056 --> 01:28:56,184
I told that cretin ten times
to get these ready!

647
01:28:56,518 --> 01:28:58,228
Don't keep picking on the boy.

648
01:28:59,521 --> 01:29:01,523
I'll kill him, the useless
little sewer rat!

649
01:29:02,524 --> 01:29:03,316
Grenouille!

650
01:29:04,985 --> 01:29:06,319
What are you doing?

651
01:29:06,486 --> 01:29:08,571
Why aren't the enfleurage
frames...

652
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:16,329
Yes, master?

653
01:29:16,997 --> 01:29:21,084
I mean, would you be good enough
to prepare the enfleurage frames?

654
01:29:25,171 --> 01:29:26,715
Certainly, master.

655
01:29:42,647 --> 01:29:44,024
Acurfew?

656
01:29:44,482 --> 01:29:45,900
Are you mad?

657
01:29:46,067 --> 01:29:49,112
Jasmine can only be picked
before dawn. We all know that.

658
01:29:49,279 --> 01:29:52,073
This could mean
the ruin of our trade.

659
01:29:52,365 --> 01:29:53,033
Yours.

660
01:29:54,075 --> 01:29:55,660
And yours and yours.

661
01:29:57,162 --> 01:29:59,289
Supposing it's your daughter
next time.

662
01:30:01,333 --> 01:30:05,003
Of course a curfew is necessary,
but we also have to catch this man

663
01:30:05,170 --> 01:30:09,341
and to do that is to understand
how he thinks, what he wants.

664
01:30:09,507 --> 01:30:13,136
I should have thought that
was obvious. Use your imagination.

665
01:30:13,345 --> 01:30:16,014
And if I were to tell you
that all except the prostitute

666
01:30:16,181 --> 01:30:18,558
went to their graves
with their chastity intact?

667
01:30:19,517 --> 01:30:20,644
How would you know?

668
01:30:20,894 --> 01:30:24,689
The coroner had each girl examined.
They were all found to be virgins.

669
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:29,194
Supposing there isn't a next time?

670
01:30:29,778 --> 01:30:33,448
If we introduce a curfew we
may all go bankrupt for nothing.

671
01:30:35,909 --> 01:30:37,869
So we wait until he's killed,
what? Six?

672
01:30:38,787 --> 01:30:40,288
Seven? Eight?

673
01:31:06,064 --> 01:31:08,566
Curfew!
Go back to your homes!

674
01:31:23,581 --> 01:31:24,708
Gentlemen!

675
01:31:25,125 --> 01:31:25,917
Gentlemen!

676
01:31:27,043 --> 01:31:31,006
We have to face the fact that our
police are helpless in this matter.

677
01:31:31,339 --> 01:31:34,009
I suggest that we ask
for support from Paris.

678
01:31:34,301 --> 01:31:36,094
Paris won't be smarter than we are.

679
01:31:36,594 --> 01:31:38,013
We must arrest every Gypsy
in Provence. And every beggar.

680
01:31:38,471 --> 01:31:40,223
And every man without
a wife and family!

681
01:31:40,473 --> 01:31:41,308
Listen.

682
01:31:44,019 --> 01:31:48,106
We have to put ourselves
inside the mind of this man.

683
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:52,819
Each of his victims
had an especial beauty.

684
01:31:53,069 --> 01:31:57,157
We know he doesn't want
their virginity, so it seems to me

685
01:31:57,324 --> 01:32:00,035
that it's their beauty itself
that he wants.

686
01:32:00,285 --> 01:32:02,954
It's almost as if he's trying
to gather something.

687
01:32:03,330 --> 01:32:06,750
As if his ambitions
are those of a collector.

688
01:32:07,667 --> 01:32:09,544
A collector? Of what?

689
01:32:10,795 --> 01:32:11,588
Their hair?

690
01:32:18,803 --> 01:32:22,974
Whatever it is,
I fear he won't stop killing

691
01:32:23,266 --> 01:32:26,144
until his collection is complete.

692
01:32:51,711 --> 01:32:52,420
Monsieur.

693
01:32:55,632 --> 01:32:59,594
This man is a demon.

694
01:32:59,844 --> 01:33:02,889
A phantom who cannot be fought
by human means.

695
01:33:03,056 --> 01:33:07,102
Now, I insist that we call upon
our bishop to excommunicate him!

696
01:33:08,478 --> 01:33:10,146
What good would that do?

697
01:33:10,563 --> 01:33:13,817
Have you no faith in the power
of our Holy Mother Church?

698
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:17,153
This is not a matter of faith.

699
01:33:17,445 --> 01:33:18,905
There's a murderer out there

700
01:33:19,114 --> 01:33:22,575
and we must catch him
by using our God-given wits!

701
01:33:23,368 --> 01:33:26,246
I say until
we submit to Mother Church

702
01:33:27,122 --> 01:33:29,082
these killings will not cease.

703
01:33:46,016 --> 01:33:50,186
Citizens of Grasse, we hereby
declare that this murderer,

704
01:33:51,229 --> 01:33:53,481
this demon in our midst,

705
01:33:54,065 --> 01:33:58,153
has incurred the sentence
of excommunication.

706
01:34:00,030 --> 01:34:03,033
Not only has this depraved monster

707
01:34:03,450 --> 01:34:05,952
robbed us of our daughters,

708
01:34:06,328 --> 01:34:09,039
the young and fair blossom
of this city,

709
01:34:09,372 --> 01:34:11,207
and by his wanton acts

710
01:34:11,791 --> 01:34:15,253
has brought our trade,
our livelihood,

711
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:18,131
our very existence,

712
01:34:18,506 --> 01:34:21,426
to the brink of eternal darkness.

713
01:34:23,637 --> 01:34:24,888
We therefore declare

714
01:34:25,722 --> 01:34:27,724
that this vile viper,

715
01:34:27,891 --> 01:34:31,311
this ignominious carbuncle,

716
01:34:31,478 --> 01:34:34,606
this execrable evil in our midst,

717
01:34:34,773 --> 01:34:38,943
shall henceforth be solemnly
banned from our holy presence,

718
01:34:40,362 --> 01:34:44,491
rejected from the communion
of Holy Mother Church

719
01:34:45,116 --> 01:34:47,452
as a disciple of Satan,

720
01:34:48,787 --> 01:34:50,997
slayer of souls.

721
01:34:51,164 --> 01:34:51,873
Stand clear!

722
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:56,169
An infected limb,
an outsider of the faith

723
01:34:57,545 --> 01:35:01,091
a necromancer,
a diabolist, a sorcerer

724
01:35:01,716 --> 01:35:04,010
and a damned heretic.

725
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:08,974
Oh, God, in Thy most
merciful spirit,

726
01:35:10,225 --> 01:35:13,144
bring down thunderbolts
upon his head

727
01:35:13,979 --> 01:35:17,691
and may the Devil
make soup of his bones.

728
01:35:18,024 --> 01:35:19,192
Amen.

729
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:22,570
My Lord! It's a miracle!

730
01:35:23,697 --> 01:35:25,573
He's been caught!
He's been caught!

731
01:35:27,617 --> 01:35:30,453
My Lord, the fiend has been caught.

732
01:35:31,246 --> 01:35:32,956
In the city of Grenoble.

733
01:35:33,123 --> 01:35:34,624
He's confessed to everything.

734
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:37,252
He's confessed to everything!

735
01:35:39,462 --> 01:35:40,588
Hallelujah!

736
01:35:40,755 --> 01:35:43,091
Hallelujah!

737
01:35:44,050 --> 01:35:45,510
Praise be to God!

738
01:35:46,011 --> 01:35:47,679
And we thank Him

739
01:35:47,846 --> 01:35:51,349
for listening to our prayers
and answering them.

740
01:35:52,225 --> 01:35:55,061
Amen.

741
01:35:55,687 --> 01:35:57,856
Amen.

742
01:36:13,997 --> 01:36:15,707
Just read the report.

743
01:36:15,874 --> 01:36:17,834
This cannot possibly
be the same man.

744
01:36:21,087 --> 01:36:25,258
He confessed to everything.
Including the murders in Grasse.

745
01:36:25,425 --> 01:36:27,719
Yes. Under torture.

746
01:36:29,304 --> 01:36:30,138
Look. Here.

747
01:36:31,431 --> 01:36:34,100
He admits to strangling
his victims,

748
01:36:34,267 --> 01:36:36,978
pulling out their hair
and ravaging them.

749
01:36:37,145 --> 01:36:40,273
The Grasse girls were killed by
a blow to the back of their heads

750
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:43,610
their hair was carefully cropped,
and not one of them was violated.

751
01:36:43,777 --> 01:36:44,402
Antoine,

752
01:36:46,154 --> 01:36:48,573
we're all happy it's over.

753
01:36:49,532 --> 01:36:50,325
Let it go.

754
01:37:38,331 --> 01:37:41,209
- Papa, what's the matter?
- We're going home. Now!

755
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:42,794
But why? I'm enjoying myself.

756
01:37:42,961 --> 01:37:46,089
- Don't argue with me, Laura.
- Stop it! I'm going...

757
01:37:53,847 --> 01:37:54,472
Laura!

758
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:57,058
Laura!

759
01:38:00,603 --> 01:38:01,938
Out of my way!

760
01:38:02,647 --> 01:38:03,273
Laura!

761
01:39:00,455 --> 01:39:01,331
Laura!

762
01:39:02,624 --> 01:39:03,375
Papa!

763
01:39:09,798 --> 01:39:11,007
I'm so sorry.

764
01:39:24,938 --> 01:39:27,732
I know you must think me
a very foolish man,

765
01:39:29,067 --> 01:39:31,027
but try to understand

766
01:39:32,112 --> 01:39:33,613
you're all I have left.

767
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:35,657
You don't need to explain, Papa.

768
01:39:35,824 --> 01:39:38,618
- If anything were to happen to you...
- I know.

769
01:39:39,411 --> 01:39:42,455
But you must stop worrying
about me all the time.

770
01:40:03,226 --> 01:40:04,811
Sweet dreams, my love.

771
01:40:08,982 --> 01:40:10,567
Sweet dreams, Papa.

772
01:41:10,669 --> 01:41:11,753
Laura!

773
01:41:22,555 --> 01:41:24,849
Papa, what's the matter?

774
01:41:29,729 --> 01:41:30,939
Did you open the window?

775
01:41:33,274 --> 01:41:33,900
No.

776
01:41:34,609 --> 01:41:35,443
Why?

777
01:41:38,822 --> 01:41:42,909
Have this letter dispatched to the
Marquis de Montesquieu immediately.

778
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,419
Stay on the road north
into the mountains.

779
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:54,230
Did Monsieur Richis leave?

780
01:42:54,397 --> 01:42:55,023
He did.

781
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:56,232
Which way?

782
01:42:57,692 --> 01:42:58,526
North.

783
01:43:05,533 --> 01:43:07,202
You sure it wasn't south?

784
01:43:07,369 --> 01:43:10,914
I saw them with my own eyes.
Why do you want to know?

785
01:43:12,666 --> 01:43:15,251
I said north. North!

786
01:43:17,671 --> 01:43:18,546
Grenouille!

787
01:43:21,132 --> 01:43:22,008
Grenouille!

788
01:43:25,095 --> 01:43:25,971
Grenouille!

789
01:43:36,731 --> 01:43:37,649
Grenouille!

790
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:55,375
Good God!

791
01:44:52,307 --> 01:44:53,725
Good afternoon, Monsieur.

792
01:44:54,434 --> 01:44:57,103
Good afternoon. Do you have
anyone else staying here?

793
01:44:57,729 --> 01:44:58,480
No, Monsieur.

794
01:44:59,064 --> 01:45:01,483
Then I would like to take
all your rooms for the night.

795
01:45:01,650 --> 01:45:03,818
It will be our pleasure, Monsieur.

796
01:45:05,278 --> 01:45:08,865
And tomorrow, at first light, we wish
to be ferried to the lle de Lérin.

797
01:45:09,616 --> 01:45:13,078
- It's deserted, just a few monks.
- I'm aware of that.

798
01:45:14,037 --> 01:45:14,746
Very well, Monsieur.

799
01:45:19,876 --> 01:45:21,503
Our finest room, Mademoiselle.

800
01:45:24,714 --> 01:45:26,383
With a superb view of the sea.

801
01:45:27,384 --> 01:45:28,176
One moment.

802
01:45:34,933 --> 01:45:35,558
Very well.

803
01:45:37,060 --> 01:45:39,688
Do you have a room next to this one?

804
01:45:39,854 --> 01:45:43,942
- Yes, but the view is different.
- I have no interest in the view.

805
01:46:37,537 --> 01:46:41,082
Papa, will you please tell me
now what is happening?

806
01:46:42,042 --> 01:46:44,210
You haven't said a word all day.

807
01:46:44,794 --> 01:46:46,630
Why all this secrecy?

808
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,636
Last night I dreamt you were dead,

809
01:46:54,179 --> 01:46:56,389
murdered like all the other girls.

810
01:47:05,982 --> 01:47:09,194
The truth is, I'm convinced that
the killer is still here somewhere.

811
01:47:11,029 --> 01:47:13,323
All of his victims
were young and beautiful,

812
01:47:13,490 --> 01:47:15,367
and who is there more beautiful
than you, Laura?

813
01:47:17,494 --> 01:47:19,204
Whatever his insane scheme,

814
01:47:19,454 --> 01:47:22,290
it will surely be incomplete
without you.

815
01:47:31,174 --> 01:47:34,302
I wrote to the Marquis accepting
his proposal of marriage

816
01:47:34,511 --> 01:47:37,389
and requesting that it take place
as soon as possible.

817
01:47:38,932 --> 01:47:42,060
Until then you will stay
in the safety of the monastery.

818
01:47:43,770 --> 01:47:46,773
And all this because
you had a bad dream?

819
01:47:47,148 --> 01:47:50,360
- I've made my decision.
- But I don't know if I love him!

820
01:47:50,777 --> 01:47:53,029
I'm afraid the circumstances
leave us no choice.

821
01:47:53,196 --> 01:47:55,282
- Papa!
- It's all arranged, Laura.

822
01:53:45,632 --> 01:53:48,051
On your feet.
Hands in the air!

823
01:54:34,306 --> 01:54:36,808
Why did you kill my daughter?

824
01:54:40,937 --> 01:54:41,688
Why?

825
01:54:45,567 --> 01:54:46,568
I needed her.

826
01:55:13,345 --> 01:55:15,764
Why did you kill my daughter?

827
01:55:20,060 --> 01:55:21,019
I just...

828
01:55:24,481 --> 01:55:25,607
needed her.

829
01:55:33,865 --> 01:55:34,908
Very well.

830
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:39,496
But remember this.

831
01:55:46,002 --> 01:55:47,545
I will be looking at you

832
01:55:50,590 --> 01:55:52,342
when you are laid on the cross

833
01:55:52,509 --> 01:55:56,471
and the twelve blows
are crashing down on your limbs.

834
01:55:59,224 --> 01:56:02,852
And when the crowd has finally tired

835
01:56:03,019 --> 01:56:05,772
of your screams and wandered home,

836
01:56:06,022 --> 01:56:09,609
I will climb up through your blood

837
01:56:12,237 --> 01:56:14,030
and sit beside you.

838
01:56:16,157 --> 01:56:19,077
I will look deep into your eyes

839
01:56:21,204 --> 01:56:23,373
and drop by drop

840
01:56:26,001 --> 01:56:29,754
I will trickle my disgust into them

841
01:56:31,756 --> 01:56:34,592
like burning acid,

842
01:56:36,428 --> 01:56:37,721
until

843
01:56:41,391 --> 01:56:42,684
finally

844
01:56:46,730 --> 01:56:48,023
you perish.

845
01:58:48,727 --> 01:58:50,687
Unchain the prisoner.

846
01:59:01,823 --> 01:59:03,241
That's enough.

847
01:59:04,826 --> 01:59:06,703
Let him be brought to the scaffold.

848
01:59:11,916 --> 01:59:12,834
What's that?

849
02:00:27,075 --> 02:00:28,451
He's over there.

850
02:02:19,020 --> 02:02:21,648
This man is innocent!

851
02:02:27,070 --> 02:02:28,571
He is innocent!

852
02:03:52,739 --> 02:03:53,365
An angel!

853
02:03:54,699 --> 02:03:55,700
This is no man!

854
02:03:56,576 --> 02:03:58,161
This is an angel!

855
02:10:00,065 --> 02:10:01,066
Grenouille!

856
02:10:07,364 --> 02:10:09,449
You can't fool me!

857
02:10:58,498 --> 02:10:59,416
Forgive me,

858
02:11:06,715 --> 02:11:07,799
my son.

859
02:12:11,154 --> 02:12:15,158
<i>The people of Grasse
awoke to a terrible hangover.</i>

860
02:12:16,660 --> 02:12:20,080
<i>For many of them,
the experience was so ghastly,</i>

861
02:12:20,246 --> 02:12:23,875
<i>so completely inexplicable and
incompatible with their morals</i>

862
02:12:24,668 --> 02:12:27,671
<i>that they literally erased it
from their memories.</i>

863
02:12:28,797 --> 02:12:31,716
<i>The town council was
in session by the afternoon</i>

864
02:12:31,883 --> 02:12:34,177
<i>and an order was passed
to the police lieutenant</i>

865
02:12:34,344 --> 02:12:37,973
<i>to immediately begin fresh
investigations into the murders.</i>

866
02:12:39,474 --> 02:12:42,352
<i>The following day,
Dominique Druot was arrested.</i>

867
02:12:42,519 --> 02:12:46,690
<i>It was in his back yard that they
found the hair of the victims.</i>

868
02:12:48,024 --> 02:12:51,611
<i>After fourteen hours of torture,
Druot confessed to everything.</i>

869
02:12:54,531 --> 02:12:56,950
<i>With that, the case was closed.</i>

870
02:13:01,204 --> 02:13:05,166
<i>By then, Grenouille was already
half way back to Paris.</i>

871
02:13:09,254 --> 02:13:13,425
<i>He had enough perfume left to
enslave the world if he so chose.</i>

872
02:13:14,301 --> 02:13:17,512
<i>He could walk to Versailles
and have the King kiss his feet.</i>

873
02:13:17,971 --> 02:13:22,142
<i>He could write the Pope a letter,
reveal himself as the new Messiah.</i>

874
02:13:23,268 --> 02:13:25,770
<i>He could do all this
and more if he wanted to.</i>

875
02:13:26,938 --> 02:13:29,816
<i>He possessed a power stronger
than the power of money,</i>

876
02:13:29,983 --> 02:13:31,776
<i>or terror, or death.</i>

877
02:13:32,444 --> 02:13:36,448
<i>The invincible power to command
the love of mankind.</i>

878
02:13:43,079 --> 02:13:46,166
<i>There was only one thing
the perfume could not do:</i>

879
02:13:46,416 --> 02:13:49,169
<i>It could not turn him
into a person</i>

880
02:13:49,336 --> 02:13:51,546
<i>who could love and be loved
like everyone else.</i>

881
02:13:52,922 --> 02:13:55,383
<i>So, to hell with it, he thought.</i>

882
02:13:55,550 --> 02:13:57,135
<i>To hell with the world,</i>

883
02:13:57,427 --> 02:13:58,762
<i>with the perfume,</i>

884
02:13:59,137 --> 02:14:00,472
<i>with himself.</i>

885
02:14:03,266 --> 02:14:06,436
<i>On the 25th of June, 1766,</i>

886
02:14:06,811 --> 02:14:08,480
<i>around 11 o'clock at night,</i>

887
02:14:09,105 --> 02:14:12,400
<i>Grenouille entered the city
through the Port d'Orleans</i>

888
02:14:12,567 --> 02:14:14,402
<i>and like a sleep-walker,</i>

889
02:14:14,903 --> 02:14:19,074
<i>his olfactory memories drew him
back to where he was born.</i>

890
02:15:41,865 --> 02:15:43,408
An angel!
