- What you're describing

is a sauna, not a mosquito net.

Not a mosquito net,
but it holds off the bugs.

so I can breathe through at night time.

cannot lock onto you.

That's right, Spook, inside Laos.

80
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,100
Now, one more thing.

81
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,000
They've been using your radios
to lure our rescue teams into ambush.

82
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,000
Now, don't get me wrong.
You go down, you use that radio.

But if they're hot on your trail,
you scrap it.

that they can use against you.

on the other side die for his instead?

But why are you in this war against us?

00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,800
I never wanted to go to war.
I never wanted to go to...

176
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:09,100
I saw enough as a child.
I only wanted to fly.

260
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,700

- Gene.
- But listen.

- Okay, Eugene.
- Eugene DeBruin from

267

- Eugene, Oregon.
- Okay.

you see this man here?

thinks is worth complaining about?

You know what that is?

280

Yeah. He's, in fact,
one of the only truly nice guys here.

This is Nook the Rook right here.
He's also very much not a nice guy.

- What is his problem?
- It's all right. Just keep going.

294
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,000
His problem is he's Crazy Horse.
That's what we call him.

295

And he is a bastard. Keep going.
And I just cannot stand him.

There is no goddamn conference.

through your skull?

00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,400
No, no, no, there was a honcho
on the outside,

311
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,700
he said I would not be here too long.

312

to get them to sign.

No, I did not sign. No.

314

Anyway, nice having met you.

315
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,000
What do you mean, met?

316
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,600
Well, my friends,
you can rot in here if you like,

317
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,800
but I'm gonna scram this very night.

318
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,300
This hut, it ain't no prison.

319
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,300
Scram. I like that. I like that.

320
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,400
Listen, listen, my friend,
you cannot escape.

321
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,900
If you try to escape,
you'll screw up our release.

322
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,500
Look, I don't give a shit about our release
or whatever you think is gonna happen.

323
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:16,900
But without water, you won't survive
more than two days out there.

324
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,800
And without water,
your tracks will be visible for even more.

325
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,900
The jungle is the prison. Don't you get it?

326
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,800
Hey, when does the rainy season start?

327
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,800
Five months, maybe six.

328
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,800
I can't wait that long.

329
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:42,100
Hey, listen, let's say you do survive
the jungle and lack of water,

330
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,100
whatever you find, snakes and animals
and shit are out there,

331
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,100
you won't make it out of camp.

332
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,900
There's six guards posted during the day.

333
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,400
Yeah.

334
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,900
That is during the day.

335
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,600
I'm going at night.

336
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,200
Why, what happens at night?

337
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,400
No.

338
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
No.

339
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,900
No.

340
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,800
I'm shitting my intestines out.

341
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,900
Again.

342
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,100
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

343
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,400
You just shit right on my hand again, man.

344
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:39,500
- Sorry.
- That makes it 2,207 times and counting.

345
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,300
Leave the guy alone, okay?

346
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,600
There ain't no alone, brother.

347
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,200
Does anybody have a nail?

348
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,100
What are you gonna do with a nail?

349
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,000
You're gonna stab all the lousy guards
to death with a nail?

350
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,500
What kind of plane you fly off of?

351
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,200
- Procet has got a shard of glass, man.
- No, that's no good.

352
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,500
I have porcupine needle.

353
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,900
No.

354
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,300
I've got a hammer and a socket wrench
stuffed up my ass.

355
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,200
There's no nails.

356
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,500
This whole prison's made
of bamboo and rattan.

357
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,800
Damn it.

358
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,900
I know where there's a nail.

359
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,700
Okay.

360
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,800
I'm gonna make my move.

361
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,800
So all of you scatter in
all directions, okay? Go.

362
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

363
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:47,000
What makes you think you're not crazy
for thinking that'll work, man?

364
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,500
Eugene's right.
It'll attract too much attention.

365
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,900
Oh, for God's sake, that's what I want.

366
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,300
Please.

367
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,400
You trust me? Please.

Duane, head to the outhouse.

369
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,200
Y.C., go to the top right. Okay?

370
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,000
Gene, please come on. No, no, no.

371
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:10,500
Gene, Phisit, Procet,
head towards the gate.

372
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,500
Move as fast as you can.

373
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,800
Get their attention, that's what I need.
Go, go, go, go. Go, go.

00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,400
Hey, Jumbo, Jumbo. Hey, no, no, no.

375
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:38,000
Can I borrow some of the toothpaste?
Let me get some of that. That's good.

376
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,400
I felt so like having a good smile,
you know?

377
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,700
Like you have. You got a good smile, too.

378
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,900
Okay.

379
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,700
Y.C., when I hit it, you make a noise.

380
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,600
Cough or something.

Let's see.

389
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,100
Oh, God. Oh, God, that was an easy one.

390
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:28,100
You see, I apprenticed as a tool
and die maker in Germany.

391
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:35,700
There was no aviation at the time
and I wanted to learn something useful

392
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,600
that would help me repair planes.

393
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:42,500
And, boy, are those years coming in handy
in unexpected ways now.

394
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,000
There's only one brand
that I cannot handle,

395
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,500
that is Smith and Wesson.

396
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,100
(EXCLAIMS)

397
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:56,600
I think with practice, I can open these up
in maybe two, three seconds flat.

398
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:06,000
But listen, everybody keep one cuff
on a wrist at all times,

399
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:11,000
so that if the guards come checking,
we can put them on again quickly.

400
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,400
No, they don't check us at night.
They think we can't get out of these.

401
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,400
They think it's impossible.

402
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,600
Show me how you did that.

403
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,700
It's so simple. Okay.

404
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,600
All you do, insert the nail.

405
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,300
There's a cuff and a spring.
They both have teeth.

406
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,800
You push down on the spring,
disengage the teeth like that.

407
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,100
You see? This is what happens inside.

408
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,300
- And the cuffs release.
- GENE: Wow.

409
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,700
Hands free.

410
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,400
DIETER: Get away.

411
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,900
Get away.

412

No, no, no, no, no. Let him.
He's our friend, Malay.

413
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,900
Let him do it. It's the best way
to heal sores around here.

that cuff thing, that's good, real good.

417
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,000
Yeah. Thanks.

Hey, Duane,

419
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,500
do you know where we are?
I mean, you have any idea?

420
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,700
No. But my guess
is that this here's still Laos.

421
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,300
And the guards, they're...

422
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,500
- Laotian.
- ... Laotian?

423
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,300
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but the camp is Vietcong,

424
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,000
there's no question.

425

Look, I know what you're thinking,

426

but jungles on these mountains
is a nightmare.

427
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,500
Besides, you'd end up in Vietnam.

428
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,300
- No, but if we can get to Thailand...
- Yeah.

429
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,000
If we can make it to the Mekong River...

430
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,100
Yeah, the Big Muddy.
If you could, you would, right?

431
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,700
Yeah. We can.

432
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,400
- Hey, why not? We can.
- Yeah.

433
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,000
Just stop talking about it. Okay?

434
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,100

what he's pissed about.

Why would the guards spend all this time

cutting bamboo and wood
to build a watchtower

to be here for a while?

00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,400
- Exactly.
- Two years.

521
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,600
- Exactly. Why would they do that if they...
- Listen. Listen to me.

522
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,700
- ... didn't plan to hold us a long time?
- Listen. Here's what it all comes down to.

- are gonna want to check that.
- Crazy. This is...

Why are you hiding it now?

00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,800

Now, have you noticed

611
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,300
that the guards when they are called
to the kitchen hut for chow time,

612
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,400
they always leave
their rifles behind, always?

613
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:40,600
So we have a few minutes
before they return for their rifles.

614
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,600
We go out through the hut,
we grab their guns,

615
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:44,900
- we surprise them.
- No.

616
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,900
- And we surprise... We surprise them...
- Crazy.

617
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,600
...and we surround them, okay?

618
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:53,700
Then we take the guards as prisoners.

619
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,600
We take over the camp.

Come on. Get something.
Get this bag.

868
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,500
- There's no shoes.
- Get this bag.

869
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Get as much as you can.

870
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,300
God damn you, Gene!

871
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,100

876
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:58,200
Y. C., what the hell happened?
Why didn't you show up at the kitchen?

877
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:01,100
Gene? Gene, where the hell were you?

878
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:04,000
Gene, where the hell have you been?

879
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:06,800
Did you hear the shooting? Did you?

880
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,000
I couldn't get a shot.

881
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:13,600
Oh, you couldn't get a shot at them.
You weren't there to get a shot at them.

882
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:16,400
Look at these.
What nice shoes you have.

883
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:19,200
Where are our shoes?
Where are our shoes?

884
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,200
Phisit.

885
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:26,000
You're telling me that he took
three pairs of shoes?

886
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:29,300
He took his, he took Duane's
and he took mine?

887
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,700
- That's right.
- DIETER: Yeah.

888
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:31,800
- Yeah.
- DIETER: That's right.

889
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:34,300
So, you were busy getting your machetes

890
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,000
and your nice shoes
while we were being shot at.

891
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:40,600
Okay. Where was this rifle?
Where did you find this rifle?

892
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,700

You just found it lying around?

896
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,500
We found it.

897
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,000
Okay, listen, that's it.

898

902
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:09,100

- 'Cause I was just thinking,

903
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:14,000
maybe you'll go back
and get one yourself.

904
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,000

Yeah, I bet you're happy.

Is that where you're going?

920
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:08,700
See you, Duane. Duane, love you, brother.
You go that way, I'll go this way.

921
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,900

922
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,500

928
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:55,500

932
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:32,600
You see over there?

933
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,100
See?

934
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:39,200
Down there must be a river.

935
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:41,500
It must lead to the Big Muddy.

936
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,400
And then we'll be out of here.

937
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,200

can float all the way down to it.

938

No one will see us.

939
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,400

Is that a waterfall?

No.

Which one of your feet is worse off?

953
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,600
That's a trick question, right?

954
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:25,000
We can trade off with this thing.

955
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:30,200
DIETER: There's no way
that we shoot it out with the Vietcong

956
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:32,100
if we run into them, so...

957
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:36,800
And we can't use these for hunting
because of the noise.

958
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:41,600
You wanna ditch them?

959
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,300
Yeah.

We'll travel by night.

I help you along.

When we reach the Big Muddy,
we'll make it across,

984
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:53,400
and I'm sure we're gonna run right
into an American officers' club.

985
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:56,100
And we're gonna go
straight into the kitchen,

986

and we're gonna order a burger
and French fries
