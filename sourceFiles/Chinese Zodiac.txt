1
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,983
Hey, you cannot pass!

2
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,412
Hi. I want to pee-pee.

3
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,909
She's gorgeous!

4
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,081
Please.

5
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,037
Come. This way. Here.

6
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,118
Thank you.

7
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,581
What's going on?

8
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:21,665
I don't get this.

9
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,749
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

10
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,676
What's happening?

11
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,790
There's a breach. Be alert!

12
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:03,874
What is it?

13
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,466
We're being attacked! Hurry!

14
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,543
Get ready!

15
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,628
What's going on?

16
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:18,639
Stop him!

17
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,770
- Stop him!
- Stop, or we will shoot!

18
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,021
Get him!

19
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,815
Get him!

20
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:28,899
This way!

21
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,910
He's under the truck! Get him!

22
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,204
He's here!

23
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,289
He's here!

24
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,517
Get him!

25
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,594
Shoot!

26
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,024
Hurry!

27
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,602
<i>There's a breach!
Don't let him get away!</i>

28
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,687
Where are the keys?

29
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,490
I can't see him. He's faster than a car!

30
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,875
I can see our cars, but nothing else.

31
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,497
Where is he? You haven't caught him?
What are you busy with'?

32
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,915
What is this?

33
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,632
Kill him!

34
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,602
What's that?

35
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,453
He's there!

37
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,401
Oh, my poor backside!

39
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,558
Shoot!

40
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,580
JC, Okay?

41
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,416
Go!

42
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,668
<i>Take</i> her <i>up!</i>

43
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,630
Hello?

44
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,674
Hey, JC, it's Jonathan.

45
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,010
<i>Did you find the Roses?</i>

46
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,515
I'm on holiday!

47
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,518
I have a new assignment. You interested?

48
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:29,769
What's the pay?

49
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,734
Twelve bronze heads from
the Old Summer Palace. You know them?

50
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,061
Chinese zodiac?

51
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,828
Going twice.

52
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,247
Sold!

53
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,714
Congratulations, Mr Morgan.

54
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,087
MP is now the proud owner
of the world's four rarest stamps.

55
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,794
You're wrong. Not four.

57
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,554
Now there is only one in the world.

58
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,645
Hey, check it out!
MP is all over the news today.

59
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,018
The boss. He's back.

60
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,600
It's the only one of its kind left.

61
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,732
Its value goes triple overnight.

62
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,779
- Father's idea.
- Genius!

63
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,404
You want a priceless antique?
I'll make it for you.

64
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,484
Next!

65
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,286
The fifth bronze head did exceptionally well.
It was a surprise to us.

66
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,120
Recent buyers, this auction season,
were all businessmen,

67
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,122
who just love their country.

68
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,546
That's because they'll do anything
for their own relics, won't they?

69
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,624
Their patriotism equals our profit.

70
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,792
Genius!

71
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,377
These bronzes,

72
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,883
each one higher than the last.

73
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:48,310
<i>Yes, sir. In 2000, the Ox head
sold for more than 7 million.</i>

74
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,637
Next item...

75
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,064
<i>Same year,
the Monkey head goes for over 8 million.</i>

76
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,563
<i>Tiger, over 15 million...</i>

77
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,736
<i>And 6 for the Pig.</i>

78
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,235
How am I getting my hands
on those bad boys?

79
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,653
What about JC?

80
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,993
He hasn't even found the <i>Roses</i> painting yet.

81
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,321
<i>Roses?</i> Don't <i>worry</i> about <i>the Roses.</i>

82
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,959
You tell JC
if he can get me all the remaining heads,

83
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,910
there's a massive bonus in it for him.

84
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,749
As long as the money is right,
JC will get you anything.

85
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,836
Well, then, you tell him it's €1 million each.

86
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,842
And if he gets us the dragon <i>as</i> well,
I'll add another zero.

87
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:25,922
Genius!

88
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,886
Professor Guan?
Martin's from National Geographic.

89
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,221
This is Professor Guan.

90
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,972
- Hi, Professor.
- How do you do?

91
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,729
<i>National Geographic</i> is <i>very well-respected.</i>

92
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,278
Our work needs
plenty of support from friends.

93
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:45,405
Especially from credible and respected
media sources such as yours.

94
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,077
I'm writing about
the 12 bronze heads right now.

95
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,030
You are the expert.

96
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,615
We want to learn from you.

97
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,541
The Pyramids of Egypt,

98
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,084
the Parthenon in Greece,

99
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,750
and Cambodia's Angkor Wat,

100
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,957
are just like China's Old Summer Palace.

101
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,752
<i>The building of the Old Summer Palace
began in 1709.</i>

102
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,258
<i>It took over 150 years.</i>

103
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,765
<i>They say its magnificence stunned the world.</i>

104
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,760
<i>Envoys called it "The Garden of Gardens".</i>

105
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,309
<i>Haiyan Hall was its largest Western mansion.</i>

106
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,145
<i>This is where
the 12 Chinese zodiac statues stood,</i>

107
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,061
<i>each majestically spouting water at noon.</i>

108
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,571
<i>In July, 1860,</i>

109
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,944
<i>foreign armies breached Fort Dagu,</i>

110
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,322
<i>and shattered the Empire's feeble defences.</i>

111
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,370
<i>On October 6th,</i>

112
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,415
<i>the invaders stormed
the Old Summer Palace.</i>

113
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,836
<i>Many imperial treasures,
including the 12 bronze zodiac statues,</i>

114
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,255
<i>were ruthlessly pillaged, or burned.</i>

115
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,003
<i>The fire lasted three nights and days.</i>

116
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:48,256
<i>This 150 year old architectural masterpiece
was razed to the ground.</i>

117
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,931
Everybody!

118
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,350
One, two, three!

119
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,766
These students come from all over.

120
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,896
They've been working here for years.

121
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,195
Repatriating relics to their own countries.

122
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,322
We need everyone to work hard.

123
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,909
It takes centuries to create a miracle.

124
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,830
<i>But a bomb or fire
can destroy it in an instant.</i>

125
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,824
After much detailed research,

126
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:20,082
we came up with almost
exact replicas of the statues.

127
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:24,253
And you are the first reporter to see them.

128
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,756
- No pictures!
- Oh.

129
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,382
Sorry.

130
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,798
Five have been auctioned. And the rest?

131
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,304
There are many rumours
of their whereabouts.

132
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:39,689
One of my students in Paris
is an expert on ancient antiquities.

133
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,318
She recently examined
two of the auctioned heads.

134
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:44,894
Which two?

135
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,155
Rabbit head and the Rat head.

136
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,276
How can I contact her?

137
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,990
I'll contact her for you now.

138
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,117
Thanks.

139
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,992
- Can I touch?
- Of course.

140
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,076
Thank you.

141
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,383
Oh. Don't worry about doing that.

142
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,836
But I should.

143
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,971
It's here!

144
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,563
The Rat head is finished. Is it very valuable?

145
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,391
Depends on what you think is valuable.

146
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,977
<i>For '£19, you can have them both.</i>

147
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,937
This is your document.

148
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,021
Welcome to Paris!

149
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,488
Thank you.

150
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,127
We are here for peace.

151
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,336
Peace! Peace in your heart!

152
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,420
Peace!

153
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,926
Everybody! Okay?

154
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,803
We will voice our concerns peacefully.

155
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,892
Guan's student lives here?

156
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,220
GPS says so.

157
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,347
Wait here.

158
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,146
Ooh! Paris!

159
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,653
Are you Shangguan Ma-ding?

160
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,230
Ah! Yes.

161
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,781
But my research says

162
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,109
that Shangguan Ma-ding
passed away several years ago.

163
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,911
Ah, my cousin. I'm Martin Shangguan.

164
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,204
Oh, really?

165
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,282
Follow me.

166
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,205
Everyone. Everyone.

167
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,209
<i>This is Martin,
he's here from National Geographic.</i>

168
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,921
He's here to do a feature
on the bronze heads that we examined.

169
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,303
We need all the help we can get
from mainstream media,

170
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,550
<i>like National Geographic.</i>

171
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,222
I'll do my best.

172
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,093
A common goal
among us young people who work here

173
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,390
is to retrieve lost relics
from various countries.

174
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,476
Of course, that includes the 12 bronze heads.

175
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:27,940
Oh.

176
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,901
So these must be the two bronze heads
that are here in France?

177
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,230
Yes. They belong to Count Marceau now.

178
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,487
I authenticated them,
and Professor Guan verified the data.

179
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:37,533
They are authentic.

180
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,281
Wow, he lives in that chéteau?

181
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,782
Sorry.

182
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:41,829
Job habit.

183
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,952
Guys, guys! Here.

184
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,287
What's going on?

185
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,667
What's wrong, guys?

186
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,337
- I was walking with Wu Qing...
- We were keeping surveillance on the cargo.

187
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,379
No batteries. Stupid!

188
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:51,923
Yeah, it's suspected
of being stolen antiques.

189
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,171
Suddenly, out of nowhere,
all these guys started beating us up!

190
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,174
That was too risky!
I've told you we only protest in peace.

191
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,676
- And you, you should have stopped him.
- No, listen...

192
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,099
No, no, no, guys. Listen to me.

193
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,895
I'd like to remind all of you
about the principles of our organisation.

194
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,264
<i>Producer of
the National Geographic channel.</i>

195
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,432
- Reporter?
- Yes.

196
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,516
- Chinese?
- Yes.

197
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,193
You must help us expose MP's crime.

198
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,269
Make them look bad!

199
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,364
- I took photos. Take a look, here.
- Sit down!

200
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,611
Be careful.

201
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,947
I'm sorry this happened on your first visit.

202
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,120
Anyway, we got
nothing else for you. Goodbye.

203
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,035
- Uh, can I have a word?
- Of course.

204
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,959
Come. Come over here.

205
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,374
What's the matter?

206
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:34,879
These people, and big companies,
you and your students must be...

207
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,255
Very good. Nothing. Bye-bye.

208
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,461
What was that about?

209
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,263
- He'll crack the code.
- Okay.

210
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:41,965
By then, I may be here.

211
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,474
You will be my escape.

212
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,478
The ground is flat,
and there's only one lower area.

213
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,975
So pick me up there.

214
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,444
Follow me.

215
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,427
Monsieur Pierre, during
our phone conversation,

216
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,225
<i>you said you wanted more information
about our bronze heads.</i>

217
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,060
<i>We've brought you this portfolio.</i>

218
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,434
I'm sure you'll find everything inside of it.

219
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,266
I'm begging you to pick up the phone,
I'm begging you.

220
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,771
- Are you certain about their authenticity?
- Yes, of course.

221
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,402
Indeed, there are many replicas
on the market now.

222
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,779
And even experienced collectors
have been fooled.

223
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,657
But if you have any doubts,
you're free to get them tested.

224
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,953
Okay, let me keep this book.

225
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,157
<i>- And I will contact you soon.</i>
- Call <i>me</i> back.

226
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:55,164
Count Marceau has used his hands
to flip through the album.

227
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,591
I believe he's going to
the secret room right now.

228
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,923
<i>Their surveillance systems
are installed outside.</i>

229
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,720
<i>Maybe they're afraid of damaging the relics.</i>

230
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,381
<i>Our research was correct.</i>

231
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,632
<i>The owner is obsessed with tidiness.</i>

232
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,389
<i>He's mysophobic just like you.</i>

233
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,061
<i>So now, we wait.</i>

234
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,183
Let's wait.

235
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,810
Mmm. They're all seeing their boss off.

236
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,061
I see.

237
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,940
Tell me when you're ready!

238
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,068
We're ready!

239
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:33,834
Five seconds.

240
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,911
I see them.

241
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,376
Hurry up.
Looks like they're coming back to you.

242
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,762
Found it. The bookshelf.

244
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,915
Hmm. Same old trick.

245
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:01,630
Oh, no.

246
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:02,958
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

247
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,714
Three sets of 46-letter combinations.

248
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,216
Even with eight computers,
it'll take two days.

251
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,285
Weird!

252
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,158
What has the boss been up to?

253
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,369
Hmm?

254
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:44,041
<i>JC". Why would a person so tidy
misplace his books?</i>

255
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,544
"14 "

256
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,557
<i>should be put</i>

257
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,555
<i>over there.</i>

258
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,554
<i>Three...</i>

259
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:04,151
<i>Ah! That's how he remembers the password.</i>

260
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,410
I know how to open it.

261
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:31,588
<i>A, 4, HI, V, 1966,</i>

262
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:35,592
<i>A, 1982, XI...</i>

263
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,934
Voilà! Genius me!

264
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,533
You found them yet?

265
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,321
No rush.

266
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,123
Rat head.

267
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,510
Rabbit head.

268
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:13,964
They look like our replicas?

269
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,515
To me, they look the same.

270
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,935
Is there anything else worth taking?

271
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,276
All junk!

272
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,736
You know what I see?

273
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:33,816
- What?
- What?

274
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,535
Pharaoh's sceptre, Czarina's staff.

275
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,736
Golden Eagle Box,

276
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,284
Star of Arabia!

277
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,370
Those are all lost national relics!

278
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,001
And now, they belong to us.

279
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,333
Yeah!

280
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,646
Guess what else I found?

281
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,106
- What?
- What?

282
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,856
A painting we dreamt of stealing.

283
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,272
<i>Did</i> you <i>say the Roses?</i>

284
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,647
You got it!

285
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,415
Been looking for you, and here you are.

286
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,663
<i>Lucky son of a gun.</i>

287
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:32,088
Just look at this photo.

288
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,835
Who are you?

289
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,716
Who are you?

290
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,677
What are you doing?

291
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:39,848
Guards!

292
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,467
Hey! Stop!

293
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,099
Hey, guys!

294
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,389
He's upstairs! Go get him!

295
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:47,686
They saw me!

296
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,065
What's going on?

298
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,154
Inside chased by dogs!

299
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,530
Need directions!

300
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,871
There he is!

301
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,181
Look! He's on the roof!

302
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,387
Go get him!

303
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,687
Go that way.

304
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,915
Bet you can't do that!

305
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,462
More dogs!

306
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:09,723
Outside the castle. Southeast. Which way?

307
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,652
There's a maze ahead of you. Don't go in!

308
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,656
I think I'm already in it.

309
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,865
Can you fly out?

310
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:21,988
No room for a take-off.

311
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,365
I got to try, anyway-

312
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,709
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,
that's the way I got to go!

313
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,163
Come on, there's no time for rhymes.

314
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,838
Just find me an exit!

315
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,010
<i>We can't see you
until you're airborne!</i>

316
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,909
Why are they stopping?

317
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,947
Are they short-sighted?

318
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:21,881
Look, he's airborne!

319
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:27,633
He's down again.

320
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,888
It's too short!

323
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:36,896
Dead end!

326
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,908
- What are you doing?
- I'm acting like a dog!

329
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,013
Bite me?

330
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,265
Lie down!

331
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,024
Good!

332
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,609
Be good.

333
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,270
Stay put!

334
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:22,692
Good dog.

335
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,072
Go!

336
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,944
You spoke English to a French dog?

337
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,742
Surprised he could understand.

339
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:49,549
Thanks I'll call you later.

340
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:50,598
Okay-

341
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,176
Guards.

342
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,260
Go check it out right now!

343
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,143
Finally, lam out!

344
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,236
Simon will handle the rest. You call him.

345
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,690
He doesn't like talking to me.
You better call him.

346
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,082
Martin?

347
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,459
Martin!

348
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,757
What are you doing?

349
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:28,883
Don't know you!

350
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,514
Was that you in the chéteau just now?

351
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,804
Coco, it wasn't me.

352
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,348
Someone else? Impossible!

353
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,805
- It was you!
- Hey, hey! Watch out!

354
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,404
- It was you!
- Hey, let go! Don't grab me! Let go!

355
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,319
How could you steal?

356
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,775
What you're talking about?

357
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,485
We've been had! They knew each other!

358
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,569
Shit!

359
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:53,700
GO, go:

360
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,998
Let go of me! Keep your eyes on the road!

361
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,041
- Are you still denying it?
- Fine, fine, it was me!

362
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,289
Why did you do that?

363
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,211
It's hard to explain right now.

365
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,211
Watch out!

367
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,019
- Are you okay?
- Meet you at the boat!

368
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,735
<i>Simon. Your 6 o'clock,
9 o'clock above!</i>

369
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:53,005
Perfect!

370
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,262
- Where is the other?
- Coco's got it.

371
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,224
You're no reporter. Who are you really?

372
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,693
I have two identities.

373
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:09,568
I am president of a non-profit.

374
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:13,196
International Foundation
of Relics, Medals and Paintings.

375
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,243
What's that? I've never heard of that before.

376
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,367
You know every organisation in the world?

377
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,864
What about the head?

378
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,583
- Give it back to the Chinese government.
- Okay!

379
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,963
Be careful, guys. Let's go!

380
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,383
It's here! Let's go!

381
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,210
Go, go! Let's go!

382
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,887
Hello.

383
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,017
Oh, no. Not this.

384
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,777
Hello, is this the police?

385
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,414
This is the one I authenticated.

386
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,256
- What's going on?
- Stay here!

387
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,888
My power cable!

389
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,316
Police! Don't move!

390
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,776
Police! Police! Don't move!

392
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:40,404
I swear that they are accomplices!

393
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,613
It's not true!

394
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,581
The Marceau family's reputation
is impeccable...

395
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,751
Had an impeccable reputation.

396
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:49,959
We've watched these tapes,
and we saw nothing.

397
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,461
There are customs documents,

398
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:55,511
and a witness
who saw nothing at the chéteau.

399
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,638
She was estranged
after her uncle rejected a loan request.

400
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:01,843
No, I was three when I last visited him.
Do you really think I'd remember?

401
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,393
- I swear to God that...
- Shut up!

402
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,977
We will keep the statue for two weeks.

403
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,684
If no one claims it, you can have it back.

404
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:14,776
If they bother you again, let us know.

405
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:16,573
- Now, you're free to go.
- Thank you.

406
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,366
- But that's not true!
- Shut up!

407
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:19,534
I swear they stole the heads!

408
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,862
You've other things to worry about!

409
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,372
Hey, how did it go?

410
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:24,915
Yeah, it went well.

411
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,084
- Hello!
- And now that we have... Oh.

412
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,372
I still want to thank
this honest and beautiful citizen of France.

413
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,628
You're welcome. All I did was tell the truth.

414
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:34,921
My name is Catherine.

415
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,386
You seem very interested
in those bronze heads.

416
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,931
I have something at my house
you might be interested in.

417
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,341
Well, think about it.

418
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,183
Drive on, Bruno.

419
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,932
- Chéteau Sichel.
- Bye!

420
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,021
I've always wanted to see it!

421
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,729
Welcome! I'm sorry.

422
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,855
There are some routine
security measures here.

423
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,153
The bank has taken possession
of everything.

424
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,818
Nothing of value is permitted to be taken out.

425
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,946
It's okay. Beautiful castle.

426
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,402
Please, follow me.

427
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,117
Let's go.

428
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:13,213
Because our family went bankrupt
in a financial crisis.

429
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,007
Well, still nice to be able to live here.

430
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,175
Thank you.

431
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,629
Your ancestors may have been

432
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,340
the last people to see
these beautiful creatures.

433
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:25,642
Yes, I know what you mean.

434
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:29,646
Things are only treasured by people
after they have disappeared.

435
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,182
Yeah, you are right!

436
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,191
Rooster?

437
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,489
It's the reason I invited you here.

438
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:40,649
Is that real?

439
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,867
It's been here since I was born.

440
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,071
This is stolen property, right?

441
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:47,535
What did she say?

442
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,542
Uh, she said, "Beautiful staircase."

443
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,248
Oh, thank you.

444
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,459
Let's go.

445
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,754
This is my great-great grandfather.

446
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,176
Her grandfather.

447
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,171
Years ago, he came back from overseas.

448
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,968
Later, his son, my grandma's father,
put together an expedition

449
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,600
<i>and went to sea 'm search of the ship,
Indestructible.</i>

450
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,065
But he never returned.
He just disappeared mysteriously.

451
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,690
I've heard you have the animals' heads.

452
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:21,024
Maybe you would have clues
about my great grandfather?

453
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,110
This is stolen property, right?

454
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,321
The value of what they've stolen
is over a billion dollars!

455
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:30,791
If you'd installed an infrared security system,
things would have been much better.

456
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:31,913
So it's my fault, then?

457
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:33,460
No, no, no...

458
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:34,536
I'll make you a promise.

459
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,873
If you don't recover that painting,
I will have you killed!

461
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,641
Oh, it's a rocking horse I had
when I was a child.

462
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:53,848
Oh. And my great-great grandfather had these
painted after his return from overseas.

463
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:58,235
It's the view he saw
after his ship was damaged.

464
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,438
Why don't you have a look around?
I'll go get some tea.

465
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,522
Thank you.

466
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:07,240
Go, go, go!

467
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,659
Okay. How can we steal it?

468
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,662
It's best if we stay two days, steal it and go.

469
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,168
Can't. We'll need a replica.

470
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:16,669
But we need data.

471
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,167
Professor Guan has that.

472
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,293
Ask Coco.

473
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,132
Don't use the word "steal" with her,
or she won't help us.

474
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,929
What do you want to do?

475
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:27,927
Look, guys!

476
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:31,101
It's Castiglione's Emperor Qianlong's
<i>Autumn Hunt!</i>

477
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,803
Is it valuable?
All antiquities are valuable.

478
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:34,559
So my grandpa's chamber
pot is priceless?

479
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,140
So this painting does exist.

480
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,770
Wasn't it destroyed already?

481
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:43,321
In 1860,
my great-great grandfather sailed to China

482
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,775
on the ship called Indestructible,
and won a great victory.

483
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:49,411
This was one of the spoils of war
he brought back.

484
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:51,613
What are you doing?

485
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,539
I'm taking it back to China!

486
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,626
This is my home.
You can't just take anything you want!

487
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,290
Just like over 100 years ago.

488
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,131
It's not like your ancestor
asked anyone before taking this painting.

489
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:03,792
Coco.

490
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,919
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!

491
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:08,797
Coco.

492
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,387
These things happened so long ago.

493
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,435
Back then, if a woman wore too little clothes,

494
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,726
someone might throw a stone at you.

495
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:18,307
No, her.

496
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:20,688
Sorry.

497
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,231
Sorry for what?

498
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,607
Don't be a bleeding heart.

499
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,405
She should be the one apologising.

500
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:26,648
What did she say?

501
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,651
Did she say something?

502
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,869
I don't need you to translate.

503
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:32,912
Did you all forget?

504
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:39,082
They came to our country a century ago,
burnt, raped, murdered and pillaged.

505
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,629
It's you who should apologise.

506
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:46,552
Over a century ago, your ancestors came
to our country to rape, pillage and murder.

507
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:50,965
Even 100 years later,
these memories still hurt the Chinese.

508
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:55,518
It's true.

509
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,769
I studied history. Whatever the excuses...

510
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:01,559
I studied history.

511
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,523
Whatever the excuses used,

512
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,488
these things did indeed happen.

513
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,782
Sorry.

514
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,320
But at the end of the day,
all of these now belong to the bank.

515
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:14,495
This is worthless to me.

516
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:15,572
I would give it to you.

517
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,575
Yeah, Coco, let's have some tea first.

518
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,752
I'm going outside, I need some air.

519
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,874
Coco...

520
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,332
- What is it?
- Look at this.

522
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,421
Sorry, sorry. I forgot something.

523
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,596
- Catherine!
- Yes?

524
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,095
- Your one great grandfather's ship?
- Yes?

525
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,973
Did it sink, or was it grounded?

526
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,516
Who knows?

527
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:42,232
You know what?
We're getting very interested

528
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,855
about finding your
one great grandfather back.

529
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,070
If we stay another couple of days,

530
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,444
get an investigation, more information,
we might be able to help.

531
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,866
Thank you! Thank you so much!
It's wonderful.

532
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,158
We have plenty of rooms here.

533
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,737
<i>You can stay as long as you</i> wish.
<i>I'm going</i> to <i>make the preparations.</i>

534
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,413
But not alive.

535
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,656
It's okay.

536
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,076
Coco.

537
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,250
Thank you. I'll call you later.

538
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,413
Thanks again.

539
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:06,544
Thank you.

540
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,921
Let's stay longer and steal the Rooster head.
Come on.

541
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,047
No stealing.

542
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,003
We're guests here. We mustn't do that.

543
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,384
Who <i>says</i> we can't?

544
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,970
They stole it from us first.

545
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,893
If we take it, we're retrieving it, not stealing.

546
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,303
A good point!

547
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:23,516
We need to make a replica, see?
But we don't have the data.

548
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,519
Professor Guan has it! I'll ask him.

549
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,774
- Good!
- Quick!

550
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,798
- Here!
- Data?

551
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,468
Hello.

552
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:58,800
Thank you.

553
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,054
I have to go pee-pee.

554
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:05,140
- This way, Madame.
- Thank you!

556
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,707
Hi!

557
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,585
- Have some cake!
- Have a balloon!

558
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,786
Bye!

559
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:34,882
Genius!

560
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,623
What are these fools doing here,
huh? Lunch picnic?

562
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,915
They're now our lunch.

563
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:31,734
Mom and dad, can we go on vacation?

564
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:36,940
Look!

565
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,567
This is what we picked up from before.

566
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,044
What do you think?

567
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,013
Eh! Ho!

568
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,728
No wonder it's not on the map.

569
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,768
Bingo!

570
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,941
He was here when he drew this painting.

571
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,643
You guys are amazing!

572
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,069
No, technology is.

573
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,737
So then what should we do next?

574
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:17,985
We'll camp down there.

575
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,158
I won't talk to your voice-mail.

576
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,659
Martin, the news said
those three heads were auctioned.

577
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,580
Huh? Impossible!

578
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:28,158
What do you mean? I'll show you.

579
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,617
No signal.

580
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,085
They must be fakes!

581
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,504
We're keeping the real ones safe. All right?

582
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,253
So you're saying that fakes
could fetch a fortune?

583
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:37,709
What about the real ones?

584
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:38,918
They're priceless!

585
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,137
- But now...
- Now, let me advise you.

586
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,429
Don't change with the lights on.

587
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,132
- Why not?
- See that?

588
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,343
- So I...
- We don't look.

589
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:48,644
Honest!

590
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,764
Seriously, we didn't see anything.

591
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,815
Don't turn on the satellite receiver.

592
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,606
Here.

593
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,194
What's with you two?

594
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,317
Still a standoff.

595
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,115
If it weren't for my little girl,
I'd left him long ago.

596
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,575
Hey, what about you?

597
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,697
Not answering.

598
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:06,746
Her birthday was three days ago.
We still can celebrate.

599
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,073
Why is she so mad?

600
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,162
You know how hard I'd been trying?

601
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:13,086
And you? You sure you won't reconsider?

602
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,506
With her temper? It's intolerable.
It's whoever leaves first.

603
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:21,169
I don't get who came up with
Valentine's Day and all those holidays.

604
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,046
Does it matter
whose idea they were?

605
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,173
What's most important is that
you were there when she needs you.

606
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,554
If I'm home every day, who'll earn money?

607
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,261
You men just don't understand women!

609
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,267
There!

610
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,145
It's Coco.

611
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,318
- I told them to stay put.
- JC!

612
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,485
Catherine!

613
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,982
- Coming! We're coming!
- Help us!

614
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,112
Hold on!

615
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,613
- Don't move!
- Help us!

616
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:45,739
I told you to stay put!

617
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,787
Hold on!

618
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,370
JC!

620
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,056
JC?

621
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,262
<i>We got trouble!</i>

622
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:09,975
What happened? What's wrong?

623
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,143
They fell down a hole!

624
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,309
Didn't I tell you to stay put!

625
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,145
It's her fault!

626
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,727
Say something I understand in English!

627
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,186
Purple

628
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,567
panties!

631
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,584
Purple is my favourite colour!

632
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,167
You came dressed for a picnic.

633
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,920
Girls, we haven't landed yet!

634
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:42,083
JC?

635
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,505
Where's your hand?

636
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,005
Under your purple.

637
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,556
- Let go!
- You sure?

638
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,632
Yeah, I'm sure!

639
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:50,971
Okay-

642
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,622
Madam, you're on the ground.

643
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:14,824
JC!

644
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:15,999
We're okay!

645
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,960
But Coco's missing!

646
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,417
JC's fine. Coco's missing.

647
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:23,212
Send the coordinates.

648
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,637
- This way.
- Yeah.

649
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,812
Coco!

650
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,235
Coco!

651
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:45,734
I'm over here.

652
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:46,860
I found Coco!

653
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,450
Tell Captain to get the medicine box.

654
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,697
Okay, got it!

655
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:53,154
You all right?

656
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,247
- My foot!
- Which foot?

658
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,497
Don't move!

660
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,965
- What? What's wrong?
- Nothing, nothing.

661
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,133
Your foot!

662
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,384
Shh!

663
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,007
Uh, nothing, nothing.

664
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,179
Snake!

665
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,980
- Where?
- Okay.

666
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:21,228
My foot.

667
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,230
It just dislocated.

668
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,280
Simon.

669
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:29,862
Look at these trees!

670
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,239
Cut down by loggers.

671
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,366
I see cannons and cannonballs!

672
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:41,411
This ship looks like it's from that era!

673
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,127
Did we just stumble
upon the Indestructible?

674
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:46,798
I think so.

675
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,756
What have you got there?

676
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,758
Check out this chain.

677
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,215
What's it doing here?

679
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,223
it goes all the way into that tree!

680
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,685
<i>The Indestructible!</i>

681
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:02,811
You've found it!

682
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,437
No, we fell on it.

684
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:06,899
No way!

685
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,275
No, it's for real!

687
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:15,866
Ah, it's okay. It's just a tarantula.

688
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:23,790
- JC!
"Huh?

689
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,042
I found my great grandfather!

690
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:27,798
What?

691
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:29,834
You can tell from the bones?

692
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,591
No, no. This ring.
It's my family's crest. I found it here.

693
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:36,091
There are two! Which one?

694
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:37,304
Instinct!

695
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,597
- Quick.
- This one!

696
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,353
- Good!
- Are you sure?

697
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:43,022
Sure. That's what you said.

698
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,974
I'll stuff your great grandfather
in my backpack.

699
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,559
His arm.
Oops. Sorry!

702
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,716
JC!

703
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,634
We found it!

704
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:19,183
Who could've imagined?
And in a place like this!

705
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,426
How did you find it?

706
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,768
Amazing!

707
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,518
We stumbled on it. And broke her foot.

708
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,725
Bonnie, I have the medical kit!

709
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:31,563
Go around! There's a known path!
Just follow the marks we left!

710
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:33,485
Okay, on my Way!

711
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,109
<i>- This is the Indestructible?
- Yeah.</i>

712
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:37,656
How did it end up here?

713
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:40,409
- Typhoon?
- Are typhoons that powerful?

714
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:41,951
- Tsunami?
- Possibly.

715
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:45,251
On our way here,
we come across graves and a few skeletons.

716
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,913
The ones outside must belong
to the ship's crew.

717
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:52,467
But judging from the decomposition
of those inside,

718
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,380
they're different from the others.

719
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,382
Some of them were stabbed as well.

720
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:59,307
They must have fought before they died.

721
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,434
Probably men who came
with her great grandfather.

722
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,103
They didn't die from natural causes.

723
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:07,265
I think they killed each other.

724
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:09,438
They killed each other?

725
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:13,488
So his son came back to look
for the spoils of war his father left behind?

726
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,147
Is that right?

727
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,241
- Correct?
- Right.

728
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,488
We need to take a leak!

729
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:19,739
- Right.
- Right.

730
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:21,570
Where are you going?

731
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,247
Bathroom!
All of you?

732
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,448
- Yeah !
- Pee-pee.

733
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:28,620
Hey, it goes downhill.

734
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:33,042
And the path is lined with logs.
No wonder they cut so many trees.

735
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,752
Hey! Don't do that! Hey, there's more.

736
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:37,633
Hey, look up there!

737
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:39,464
That's a huge anchor!

738
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,724
Weird. Why's it hung up there?

739
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,349
It's a clever lever device.

740
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:51,059
As the anchor descends,
the chain rod will ascend,

741
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:54,237
and it sends the trunk downhill
via the pulley.

742
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:58,112
No wonder I couldn't find
a single pulley on the ship.

743
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:02,411
This is how we benefit
from our ancestors' wisdom!

744
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:03,988
You don't seem excited.

745
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:08,000
I'm thinking about
how to take this trunk back with us.

746
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,916
If it's really filled with...

747
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,087
It's not an "if".

748
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,839
Money! Money! Money!

749
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,716
JC, the medical kit.

750
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:21,555
And your friend is here.

751
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,428
Hey. JC!

752
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,101
I'm very happy to see you again.

753
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:29,939
My friend, it's a big surprise.

754
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,274
Pierre?

755
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:37,571
Catherine.

756
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:39,615
Address me as "miss".
You're ridiculous!

757
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,691
Shut up!

758
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:42,573
You're not in our castle an more.
<i>Y</i>

759
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:43,652
Okay-

760
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,951
I knew you were working together.

761
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,954
Give me the painting
and all the things you stole.

762
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,456
You think I would bring
everything to this island?

763
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:53,003
Ready!

764
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:54,205
Pierre!

765
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,126
You Okay?

766
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:01,880
Idiots!
I told you not to load the guns!

767
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:02,963
Don't move!

768
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:04,674
Or I'll blow your heads off!

769
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:06,225
We've been watching you.

770
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,426
- They pirates?
- Yup!

771
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,511
Must be.

772
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:12,474
If you don't do what I say, I'll kill you all!

773
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,274
If we work together, we can beat them.

774
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,359
We've been here for a long time.

775
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:27,451
Only now do we know this place.

776
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,033
Welcome to our island, friends!

777
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:33,666
We're reasonable men.
All we want is your money.

778
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,210
Squat! Hurry up! Understand?

779
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:40,669
Don't do anything stupid,
and no one gets hurt!

780
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:46,140
The ransom is $500,000 each.

781
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:48,718
Do what you need to do.

782
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:50,223
Bravo!

783
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,100
Or we can feed you to the sharks!

784
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,601
Bravo!

785
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:56,480
I don't mind
keeping the women, though.

786
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,482
Bravo!

787
00:48:58,686 --> 00:48:59,812
Let me tell you something.

788
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,939
We are not with them.

789
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:05,071
And my boss would be very happy
to get you any money you want.

790
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:06,277
He's very rich.

791
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,704
Those guys want to fight you,
but I said, "No"!

792
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,204
Take them away! Go!

793
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,868
Thank you!

794
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,291
So, fellas, what are you doing on my island?

795
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,456
We do not understand English.

796
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:19,586
It's my hat!

797
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:21,542
Hey!

798
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,794
Tell me, what are you doing here?

799
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:24,879
Don't understand.

800
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,714
- Mandarin?
- Mmm.

801
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,101
Boss asked what you were doing here.

802
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,064
Barbecue.

803
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:36,808
What did you say?

804
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,776
This is a metal detector.

805
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:41,487
Barbecue? With this?

806
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:42,984
What are you doing with this?

807
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,732
Mini microwave.

808
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,569
Do you think I'm stupid?

809
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,821
This is a metal detector.

810
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,156
What are you looking for?

811
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:55,080
Okay. You don't want to tell me?

812
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:57,370
I'll find out.

813
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:58,500
Take the girls.

814
00:49:58,579 --> 00:49:59,671
Hands off!

816
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,462
Lie down!

818
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:22,194
What the...

819
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,316
I didn't pull the trigger!

820
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:24,605
One o'clock!

821
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,282
Boss! Are you okay?

822
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,247
Don't move!

824
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:47,921
I forgot to tell you. No bullets.

825
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,385
- Don't let him get a gun!
- Right!

826
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:11,860
Captain!

827
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:13,070
Hurry!
This way!

828
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:15,535
Twelve o'clock!

830
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:28,878
- What should we do now, boss?
- Let's get out of here!

831
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,845
Mother of Mercy, I'm scared!

832
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:49,690
Snake head?

833
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:15,799
Heads up!

835
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:25,855
My foot!

836
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,445
Ow! My foot!

837
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,279
That's my great grandfather! No!

838
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,284
No, no, no!

839
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:38,664
No! My great grandfather! No, no, no!

840
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:50,717
Sorry!

841
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:51,794
It's okay.

842
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,925
My great grandfather! Thank you.

843
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:55,673
Girls, let's go!

844
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,599
My foot! My shoe!

845
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,104
- Come on!
- Okay.

846
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:09,820
Hurry! Go!

847
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,364
- Don't worry.
- What are you doing?

848
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,611
-it's okay. It's safe.
- What are you doing?

849
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:15,992
- Jump. Here.
- Come on!

850
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:18,742
It's safe.
Here, don't be frightened.

851
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,872
My foot...

852
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,200
I got you. Go!

853
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,283
- You first.
- Okay.

854
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,664
- Gol
-Wait! My shoe'

855
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:25,790
It's okay.

856
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,206
Here.

857
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:30,833
Come on!

858
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,461
- It hurts!
- JC! Get the head!

859
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:35,929
Catch the head!

860
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,757
- Take them and go!
- What about you?

861
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,217
- Meet you at the trunk!
- Right!

862
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:41,977
There's something in my shoe.

864
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,687
Take it!

866
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:56,741
Catch!

867
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:58,910
Any more?

868
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:00,654
Don't move!

869
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,497
This gun has bullets.

870
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,288
Quick!

871
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,037
Help me!

872
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:10,873
- Oh, come on!
- Count to three!

873
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,467
- One, two...
- Hey!

875
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,258
No! No!

876
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:23,309
- Just one?
- I have only one life!

877
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,073
Are they all dead?

878
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:46,204
Run!

880
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,005
Don't move! Hands up!

881
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,379
I'm done being reasonable!

882
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,549
Barbecue this, smart guy!

883
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:34,540
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Don't move! Don't move!

885
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:50,021
- You okay?
- What do you care?

886
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,559
'Go, 90, go!
- This Way!

888
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:58,655
- Got her. Let's go!
- Go, go, go! Are you all right?

889
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,073
Take this!

890
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,610
JC. This?

891
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:04,741
Oh!

892
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:07,073
Come on!

893
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:10,243
Catch this!

894
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,621
We are so lucky!

895
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:20,298
My foot! It really hurts!

896
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:21,921
A bone!

897
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:27,134
Coco! You okay?

898
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,181
- Gold!
- How'd you know there's gold?

899
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,472
- It fell out.
- You know that there's gold in the trunk?

900
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,182
I didn't say it was from the trunk.

901
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,391
- Let me see.
-It's from my shoe.

902
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,977
- Is there gold inside the trunk?
- No, no.

903
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:40,648
- Pack it up!
- It's changed!

904
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:42,483
- The Snake head?
- JC!

905
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,324
The Dragon head must be back in there!

906
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,488
- You go!
- You go!

907
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,496
- Never mind!
- How do we get out of here?

908
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:53,373
- One way!
-One way!

909
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,330
Wait!

910
00:56:57,706 --> 00:57:00,050
- Watch my hand.
- I got it, no problem!

911
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,593
"Got it", my ass. My turn!

912
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:04,255
Watch my hand.

913
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,007
Captain, Captain! Go southeast!

914
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,593
The road ends here!

915
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:12,013
This way!

916
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:15,895
Get ready!

917
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,271
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

918
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,360
It's stuck!

919
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:30,573
What's going on?
No time to explain!

921
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:40,708
You've got nowhere to go!

922
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,714
Come. Don't shoot! Come on!

924
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,963
- Scarf! Scarf! Quick!
- Right.

925
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:47,093
Hurry!

926
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,724
- Put it on them.
- Here.

927
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,801
Put it on!

928
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:51,851
- Simon!
- Yeah?

929
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:53,554
- Here.
- Put it on!

930
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,890
Have some honey!

931
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,227
<i>I</i> told you!

932
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,031
Fire in the hole!

933
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:11,822
- Can you do it?
- You do it!

934
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,748
- You do it!
- What? No!

935
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,920
The bees are coming!

936
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,598
Smoke bombs! Hurry!

937
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:45,564
It's moving. Go!

938
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:12,883
Stop! You stupid!

939
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,185
It doesn't matter! Let them go!

940
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:21,646
We still have five.

942
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,818
The bees are not so friendly.

943
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,650
- One of you guys I'll kill.
- No! No! No!

944
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,659
- Call your boss!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

945
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:56,760
- Everybody okay?
"Okay!

946
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,015
Money!

948
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:20,033
- Everybody okay?
"Okay!

949
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:21,585
Anybody hurt?

950
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:24,626
- Yeah, okay!
- You lost your great grandfather.

951
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,832
It's okay. It's okay. He loved the sea.

952
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,553
- Hey! Here!
- Here!

953
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:45,184
Hey. guys! Here!

954
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:51,441
Inside this trunk,
there are 2,900 pieces of gold.

955
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:54,026
Multiply that by the density of the gold,
and that means that...

956
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:56,328
There are 8 tons?
So much!

957
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:57,404
A ton each.

958
01:00:57,571 --> 01:01:00,450
- What's the result'?
- Eight tons! Maybe more!

959
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:02,751
Let's celebrate! Let's go outside!

960
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,379
One word for this journey, romantic!

961
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,004
Thrilling!

962
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,423
Rewarding!

963
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,587
Intriguing!

964
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:11,964
Satisfying!

967
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:43,576
<i>Leave your message after the tone.</i>

968
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:46,002
I know you're next to the phone.

969
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:49,631
Stop sulking
and pick up the phone and yell at me.

970
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:51,958
Fine then!

971
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,919
Can't you two
ever have a proper conversation?

972
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:58,223
We start off nice and calm every time,
but we always end up having a fight.

973
01:01:58,298 --> 01:01:59,845
- Morning!
- Morning!

974
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:01,893
- Thank you for last night!
- Sure. So, do you guys...

975
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:03,766
- Hey, your medicine.
- Thank you.

976
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,022
Do you guys have something
you want to tell me?

977
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:08,650
- Like what?
- Good morning, everybody!

978
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,276
What are you trying to say?

979
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:13,905
You always meant to look for that gold.
You even brought metal detectors.

980
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:17,367
Gold or bronze, we need metal detectors.

981
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:18,819
Still lying!

982
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:22,281
You wanted to find this gold, didn't you?

983
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:26,376
How could you go through my stuff?

984
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,078
Stop being a jerk.

985
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:30,380
After he threw up,
I helped you back to your room and saw it.

986
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:31,961
Hey, check it out! Dolphins.

987
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:34,467
Ah! Whales, too!

988
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,303
Crocodiles!

989
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:38,005
- There's no crocodiles in the sea.
- There are?

990
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:40,257
They can swim over.

991
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,224
You work well together.

992
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:46,141
Since you know, fire away.

993
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:48,894
You're not even Shangguan Martin,
Martin Shangguan.

994
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:50,267
Yeah.

995
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,606
You weren't looking
for Catherine's great grandfather.

996
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:54,063
You came for the gold and the bronze heads!

997
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,027
You could say that.

998
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:59,367
Whenever you recover a bronze head,
you end up auctioning it.

999
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,328
- True.
- What do you plan to do with these two?

1000
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:04,872
They will be picked up at the port.

1001
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,792
I thought you were doing this
for the Chinese people.

1002
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:08,914
But you're just a mercenary!

1003
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:13,166
There are antiques everywhere.
Why can't we profit a little from them?

1004
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:14,249
You feel no shame?

1005
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:15,967
What about national dignity?

1006
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:18,886
These battered heads
have nothing to do with dignity.

1007
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:21,222
They represent centuries
of our cultural heritage!

1008
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,475
Centuries are nothing!
China is thousands of years old.

1009
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:27,103
What we could achieve then,
we can do better now.

1010
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:30,352
- What's going on?
- Boy-girl problem. Come on.

1011
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:34,444
I'll get someone to make you a dozen,
from every dynasty.

1012
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:35,520
Scoundrel!

1013
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:37,360
What, me?

1014
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:40,735
From your first day with Professor Guan
and then meeting me, you've been using us!

1015
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:44,405
Young lady,
don't pretend you're holier than me.

1016
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:45,864
We didn't ask you to come.

1017
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:48,575
If a fish doesn't open its mouth,
it can't take a bite.

1018
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:49,705
It's, "Take the bait"!

1020
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:55,211
Being a cheat is nothing to be proud of.

1021
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:57,167
Your victims trusted you.

1022
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,093
Come on!
We did this long before we met you.

1023
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,594
Doesn't matter what you do.

1024
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,672
But if you wrong your family
and your countrymen,

1025
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:05,009
your children and grandchildren
will live in shame!

1026
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,343
Stop the boat!

1028
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:10,271
What's wrong?

1029
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:11,765
The gold!

1030
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,201
- What's wrong?
- Nothing! Just stay in the boat.

1031
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:42,386
What happened?

1032
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:43,634
It was fine just now.

1033
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:47,309
The gold was heavy, and it had
been soaking for too long. it sunk.

1034
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:49,136
Didn't you calculate?

1035
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:52,063
You're the one who didn't do it right!
You only tied the rope to one end!

1036
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:53,811
- No, it's not. It's all your fault!
- Me?

1037
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:56,021
- Shut up! Hey!
- You're the one who messed it up!

1038
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:58,195
It's no one's fault. Talk on the boat!

1039
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,147
We can return and salvage it.

1040
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,445
- Yeah.
-"Right", my <i>ass!</i>

1041
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:05,118
It all belongs
to the pirates around here, now.

1042
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:07,662
Consider it a fee. We're sharing it.

1043
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:11,332
The seas here have pirates
from seven nations. How do we share it?

1044
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:12,826
Enough! Knock it off!

1045
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,496
If it's any consolation to you,
I still have one.

1046
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:18,044
Whoever needs money, can have it.

1047
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:25,510
You are luckier than her great grandfather.
At least you won't go home empty-handed.

1048
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,006
True.

1049
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:30,052
Someone did try to take the gold back
to their country once,

1050
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:32,354
but no matter what,
it will never leave the Earth.

1051
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:34,514
Pirates from seven nations now guard it.

1052
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:36,436
More safe put in the bank.

1053
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,192
We'll leave it all here undisturbed.

1054
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:50,781
Mark the coordinates. Hurry!

1055
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:01,875
Professor Guan.

1056
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,303
Professor Guan, your help is needed
on the theft of the bronze heads.

1057
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:08,006
Carry on, and follow my instructions.

1058
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:13,478
<i>REPORTER". Today, the sale of a bronze
Ram's head and a bronze Snake's head</i>

1059
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,897
<i>has set a new record
at an art auction in London.</i>

1060
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:18,941
<i>The last one, the Dragon,
is expected to sell for even more.</i>

1061
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:22,563
<i>The sale of the bronze heads
has provoked much controversy.</i>

1062
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:27,777
<i>Calls for repatriation of relics
are intensifying.</i>

1063
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:30,654
<i>We don't want our patriotic
sentiment to be hijacked.</i>

1064
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:34,032
<i>Thanks to these young people
who try hard in expressing their views.</i>

1065
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:35,784
Yes!

1066
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:38,503
<i>The golden mask of a pharaoh's concubine</i>

1067
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:42,173
<i>and the sacred smiling Buddha
were passed in an auction today,</i>

1068
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:45,593
<i>affected by the increasing
international uproar.</i>

1070
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:50,256
Police.

1071
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:52,384
Do you know these people?

1072
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:59,641
<i>In breaking news,
MP Corporation has announced</i>

1073
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:02,694
<i>it has won the right
to auction off the bronze Dragon head.</i>

1074
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:05,272
<i>The piece will go to market
as soon as possible.</i>

1075
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:09,363
From now on, forever and ever,
I will never bother you again.

1076
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:11,281
We found it! We found it!

1077
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:13,280
You found what?

1078
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:19,252
The Dragon head.
MP will put it up for auction next week.

1079
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:24,007
Yeah, and they've had it all along.
That bonus, we could've never gotten it.

1080
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:28,136
- So we've been conned.
- Yeah, we behaved like amateurs.

1081
01:07:28,503 --> 01:07:30,176
And Jonathan lied to us.

1082
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:32,974
He's been working with MP.
I think they beat up those students, too.

1083
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,560
...profit has just released
its new sales catalogue, causing concern...

1084
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:43,518
ENOUGH OF THE SELLING
OF NATIONAL TREASURES

1085
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:48,778
In time for the Chinese Year of the Dragon,
I present the bronze Dragon head.

1086
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:51,360
Starting price, €6O million.

1087
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,907
National Heritage not for sale!

1088
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:56,786
Cultural relics from many countries
were pillaged and ended up abroad.

1089
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:59,083
They include
the renowned bronze Dragon head,

1090
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,581
one of the 12 zodiac bronze heads.

1091
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:04,172
Ladies and gentlemen, are there any bids?

1092
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:06,298
€10.

1094
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:11,796
<i>Pass!</i>

1095
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,013
REPORTERS:
Any comment on the unsold Dragon head?

1096
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:17,434
Will the Dragon head be re-auctioned again?

1097
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,514
Do you think not selling this piece
will affect the reputation of MP Corporation?

1098
01:08:26,978 --> 01:08:28,070
Get different angles!

1099
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:30,694
Michelle, send this to Coco, quick!

1100
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,406
Hey, take a few more with this.

1102
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:42,832
What interview? I do not give interviews.

1103
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:44,712
<i>- Hello?
- Boss,</i>

1104
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:46,543
we caught three students. What now?

1105
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:49,129
- They took photos.
- Just lock them up for now.

1106
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:52,845
- There's really no other solution?
- Why let it drag on?

1107
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:56,591
- Thought about it all morning.
- Thanks!

1108
01:08:56,758 --> 01:09:00,388
- Joni, Tommy, Jeffrey, Shirley...
- Would you please give this letter to her?

1109
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:04,106
Take it easy with women. Be cool, like me.

1110
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:07,523
Hello! Ah? Ah?

1111
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:10,605
Yes, yes! I know, I know it's you.

1112
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:14,488
- Finally returning his calls!
- No, no, no, not busy.

1113
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:17,116
Those two idiots were leaving. Yeah.

1114
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:21,325
Whatever you want. You pick.

1115
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:27,080
Chinese, Italian, French.

1116
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:29,590
Yeah. Whatever you want.

1117
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:31,713
Right.

1118
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:33,044
Okay-

1119
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:34,928
I agree.

1120
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:36,923
Good choice!

1121
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,178
So true.

1122
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:41,682
Great. Yeah, I'll wait for you.
Till the end of time.

1123
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:43,183
Yes. Yes. Bye-bye!

1125
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:49,773
Yes! Yes!

1126
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:53,940
I got her wrapped around my finger.

1127
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:58,954
Like they say,
"As a man sows, so shall he reap".

1128
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:02,074
-"God helps those who help themselves".
- Coco's here.

1129
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:04,705
- Who?
- Coco, outside. Wants you.

1130
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:07,871
What does she want?

1131
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:12,463
For me?

1132
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:20,887
Are those students okay?

1133
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:22,802
Three more are missing now.

1134
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:24,349
What?

1135
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:28,274
<i>COCO". My brother, Lily and Michelle.</i>

1136
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:30,522
Before my father passed away,

1137
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:34,731
he asked me to always look after him.

1138
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:38,325
He's my only family now.

1139
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,825
He is our family's future.

1140
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:47,536
We're all passionate about each making
our own contributions to our countries.

1141
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:52,089
But now, two of us are lying in hospital beds,
and three of us are missing.

1142
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,751
And we don't even know
if they are alive or dead.

1143
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:55,835
I beg you.

1144
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:57,962
Did you call the police?

1145
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:00,966
I've tried everything.

1146
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:03,642
There's nothing else to do.
You're my last resort.

1147
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:07,055
Of course if I can help you, I will.

1148
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,231
But these people...

1149
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:11,985
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

1150
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:18,483
And because Professor Guan
gave me the data,

1151
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:20,989
he's been detained by the police.

1152
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,713
Why are you crying?

1153
01:11:55,061 --> 01:12:02,070
Mom and Dad, do you really have to do this?

1154
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:08,541
Coco said her brother disappeared

1155
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:11,165
while spying on the MP
after the Dragon head auction.

1156
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:12,712
MP must have something to do with this.

1157
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:15,373
There are trees, nothing else.
Where's the proof'?

1158
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:17,458
Find it! Aren't you a compassionate person?

1159
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:19,590
I feel more for you. Is this what you want?

1160
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:23,389
- We can't even tolerate each other.
- What, tolerate each other?

1161
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:25,432
Do you stink?
Does he embarrass you in public?

1162
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:27,226
Don't just give up until you've really tried.

1163
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:31,022
Stop patronising me and go and save them,
or it will be too late!

1164
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:33,816
Promising to help them is easy. But how?

1165
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:36,610
You're the one who said
you mustn't give up until you've tried!

1166
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:38,654
- Hey, JC!
- Hey! Jonathan!

1167
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:39,772
<i>What's up?</i>

1168
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:42,530
You won't believe it.
I just found the <i>Roses</i> painting.

1169
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:44,531
<i>Great, I'll come right over!</i>

1170
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:45,987
See, that's the way!

1171
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,367
Speak!

1172
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:49,574
I didn't lie about MP's address.
Why would I lie about it?

1173
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:50,909
I believe you.

1174
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:55,418
But you knew that MP had the Dragon head.
And we'll never get the bonus, would we?

1175
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:58,424
How would I know'?
We're old partners. Why would I lie to you?

1176
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:02,129
- You never lied to me?
- No way! Why would I lie to you?

1177
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:04,051
What are you doing?

1178
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:07,885
This is the world's most powerful acid.
I made it just for you.

1179
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,311
And don't move!
Have you lied to me?

1180
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:14,140
Yes. I lied to you from day one.
From day one!

1181
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:21,363
I told the truth, so why'd you do that?

1182
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:26,160
Fruity salts.

1183
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:27,577
Genius!

1184
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:31,749
Did you find Simon and David?
Probably on a date.

1185
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:37,919
You came all the way out here to see me,
or is this visit just to cut out the middleman?

1186
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:41,752
They are blood-suckers.
Jonathan lied about the Dragon head.

1187
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:46,469
Can't really blame him.
We've had the Dragon head for ages.

1188
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,094
Even I forgot about it.

1189
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,141
Never mind.

1190
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:52,516
In our business, we all cheat each other.
I'm used to it.

1191
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,306
Where's the <i>Roses?</i>

1192
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:07,030
We wouldn't have brought it here
if it was a fake.

1193
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:08,361
I still have to examine it.

1194
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:11,038
- But it can't leave our sight.
- Fine.

1195
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,162
Just go ahead.

1196
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:18,959
Check this out for me.

1197
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:22,967
I can't clone one so quickly.

1198
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:27,054
Verify this, please.

1199
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,472
Wait here.

1200
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,474
Can we look around, too?

1201
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:31,968
Be my guest.

1202
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:34,600
Who'd have thought they could hide
a huge lab under a vineyard?

1203
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:36,681
Actually, it's a hub for counterfeiting.

1204
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:39,608
They make billions every year.
They control everything.

1205
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:42,316
Hey! What are those guys doing there?

1206
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:46,741
They're sandblasting a porcelain vase,
which will then be chemically treated.

1207
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:50,286
After that,
it will end up looking like an old antique.

1208
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:53,660
Chinese Xuan paper is layered
and can be separated.

1209
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:56,993
This is an original.
Peel it apart, get two originals.

1210
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:59,329
- Can't you make five or six?
- They'd be too thin.

1211
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:02,165
- What about that?
- That one's silk, no layers.

1212
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:05,297
So they slice it up into eight parts for sale.

1213
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:07,382
I'm impressed they thought of it.

1214
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:12,008
See? The pieces of old relics
can be perfectly restored.

1215
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:13,889
They just combine the parts with replicas.

1216
01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:16,433
So it's partly real, partly fake?

1217
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:21,313
After exposure to X-ray, a brand new vase
can gain 1,000 years of history.

1218
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:24,983
They're very resourceful.
How much on the market is real?

1219
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:26,735
90% are fakes now.

1220
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:28,691
I pity those rich people.

1221
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,276
Hey. This way.

1222
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:33,700
Wow. What is this?

1223
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:37,033
This is a special furnace
to emulate carbon emissions.

1224
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:39,539
Designed to fool antique experts.

1225
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:41,750
But is not perfect yet.

1226
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:45,584
So the fuel and the catalyst
still have to be added by hand.

1227
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:49,011
I can't believe they'd try this.

1228
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:51,635
Well, it looks very crude. Is it dangerous?

1229
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:55,472
Anything involving deception
is dangerous.

1230
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,145
Hey! Nice to see you, JC!

1231
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:05,270
Did you lose your tongue?

1232
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:08,697
- I don't want to see you.
- Come on, man.

1233
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:11,492
- Who's this guy?
- This is JC.

1234
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:13,657
A big name in the business.

1235
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:15,742
Reputations can be deceiving.

1236
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:18,282
Competitor?

1237
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:21,164
We are not the same.
We will never do what he does.

1238
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:22,790
Hey, don't be so cocksure, all right?

1239
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:25,423
Whatever you do, I can do better.

1240
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:34,011
Vulture, you stole a Buddha
from a Southeast Asian temple.

1241
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,934
That's right. And those people still think

1242
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:39,603
that it was the work
of a neighbouring country.

1243
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:43,266
It sparked a border war,
killing thousands of people.

1244
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:44,851
People die.

1245
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:46,143
That's their business.

1246
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:49,196
You're the scumbag of our business.

1247
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:53,450
You know, the last person who called me that
is no longer breathing.

1248
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:54,743
Oh, yeah?

1249
01:16:56,695 --> 01:17:01,371
S-C-U-M-B-A-G.

1250
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:03,752
Scumbag.

1251
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:07,252
I can kick your ass
without leaving this couch.

1252
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:13,261
Show me.

1253
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:34,362
You lose!

1254
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:36,235
Still touching.

1255
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:47,139
Hey!

1258
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:55,148
Touching.

1259
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:58,533
Stop!

1260
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,781
You can all go now. Have a good vacation.

1261
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:03,864
Good night!

1262
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:11,497
What are you guys doing?

1263
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:13,708
Just checking the furniture.

1264
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,344
Cheap imitation.

1265
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:20,886
Hey, boys, take it outside. Not here. Okay?

1266
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:23,509
-It's real.
- The <i>Roses!</i>

1267
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:25,432
Eleven o'clock.

1268
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:28,185
Leave them here when you're done.
We'll clear them later, okay?

1269
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:32,522
You'll be paid tomorrow. As usual.

1270
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:35,028
Your price is very high.
I think we should wait for Dad.

1271
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:37,736
I can give you a discount.

1272
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:39,195
But I want three people.

1273
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:40,742
What?

1274
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:44,038
The students you have up there.

1275
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:48,125
I don't quite understand.

1276
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:50,123
Let me show you.

1277
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:55,465
That confirms I'm right.

1278
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:59,219
Fine, then. Prove it if you can.

1279
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:01,971
Hey.

1280
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:06,681
I will then.

1281
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,142
Stop him!

1282
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:12,771
I said stop!

1283
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:13,851
Don't move!

1284
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,697
Don't let him get away!

1285
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:20,573
Stop!

1286
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:24,862
Stop him!

1287
01:20:44,715 --> 01:20:46,217
There he is, let's go!

1288
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:49,307
Go down! He's getting away!

1289
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:15,162
Open the door! Hurry!

1290
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:42,656
JC, so, now, what have you proved?

1292
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:55,536
Ooh!

1294
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:02,293
Stop him! Don't let him run away!

1295
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:19,519
I've been looking for a punching bag all day.

1296
01:22:19,977 --> 01:22:21,194
You hit the jackpot.

1297
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:30,496
- Vulture, do something.
- No, no, no. It's girl-on-girl time.

1298
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:31,697
Oh, yeah!

1299
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:33,369
Show me what you got!

1300
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:16,743
He's over there! Get him!

1301
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:20,079
Is he still going?

1302
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:35,219
Hmm!

1303
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:51,735
Vulture, take him out!

1304
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:54,280
Five against one, man.

1305
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:57,207
Only cowards with no guts fight like that.

1306
01:23:57,282 --> 01:23:59,330
Now, that is a fair game.

1307
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:55,693
So ugly!

1308
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:04,493
What are you waiting for? Get him, go!

1310
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:12,668
It's gonna blow!

1311
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:15,216
"Run!
- Go!

1312
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:16,672
Get out of there, it's gonna blow!

1313
01:26:17,506 --> 01:26:18,507
Run! Quick!

1314
01:26:52,499 --> 01:26:54,627
Wu, you okay?

1315
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:57,379
Martin?

1316
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:05,686
Michael!

1317
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:08,019
Dad!

1318
01:27:13,019 --> 01:27:15,238
- Bonnie!
- Here. I'm fine.

1319
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:19,197
Lawrence.

1320
01:27:19,776 --> 01:27:22,529
JC, finally we meet.

1321
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:25,328
Daddy!

1322
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:27,622
- JC did it!
- Shut up!

1323
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,161
You idiot.

1324
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:30,587
I'm going to kill you!

1325
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:32,752
What did I teach you?

1326
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:35,209
We don't kidnap people!
We make fake things!

1327
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:38,546
Boss, I think we need to leave
as soon as possible.

1328
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:42,011
- Is that real?
- It is real.

1329
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:45,268
- You got it tested?
- Yes, I've tested it.

1330
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:50,015
JCS.

1331
01:27:51,141 --> 01:27:52,859
I wish we could've met
under different circumstances.

1332
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:55,028
I wish you'd make real things.

1333
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,488
Well, you certainly took care of that.

1334
01:27:57,564 --> 01:28:00,033
And for your trouble,
I'm going to keep this free of charge.

1335
01:28:00,567 --> 01:28:05,164
Now, I certainly hope you'll escort
these nice young people home safely,

1336
01:28:05,363 --> 01:28:07,206
and then you and I
can resume our relationship.

1337
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:08,329
Is that a deal?

1338
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:13,588
Oh!

1339
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:17,668
Sorry about the Dragon.
I guess it just disappeared. No extra zero.

1340
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:19,378
Enjoy your Roses.

1341
01:28:21,338 --> 01:28:24,763
- Dad, you're letting him off too easy.
-lnterpol's onto this place.

1342
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:26,969
We have to destroy it anyway.
He just saved us the trouble.

1343
01:28:27,511 --> 01:28:29,639
- I have a job for you.
- Yes, sir.

1344
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:34,443
The antique market has tanked because
of these whiny hippies and all their protests.

1345
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:37,738
I want to teach the world a lesson,
starting with the Dragon head.

1346
01:28:37,813 --> 01:28:41,033
- How?
- Time for the Dragon to fly.

1347
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,577
Vulture!

1348
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:47,201
What a pity-

1349
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:53,166
<i>Auction houses have come under pressure
after protests broke out around the world</i>

1350
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:55,168
<i>calling for the return of national treasures.</i>

1351
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:58,629
<i>Let's begin our private auction
for the precious Dragon Head.</i>

1352
01:29:01,086 --> 01:29:02,588
All right. Thank you so much!

1353
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:04,218
Hey! Good news, good news!

1354
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:07,050
Chinese businesses worldwide
donated 50 million.

1355
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:08,134
Well, it's useless.

1356
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:11,518
The Chinese government won't accept
any relics that are acquired at an auction.

1357
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:13,815
Well, tell them we'll buy it first
and keep it in trust for them.

1358
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:15,813
We can't.
Whoever buys it becomes the enemy.

1359
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:19,901
<i>The second and last time it will
be up for auction, with no starting price.</i>

1360
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:22,653
<i>Do I have any opening bids?</i>

1361
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:25,615
<i>With the international press
waiting for answers,</i>

1362
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:29,198
<i>MP Corporation has threatened
to dump the Dragon head into a volcano</i>

1363
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:32,000
<i>if no bids are received before noon today.</i>

1364
01:29:32,075 --> 01:29:36,251
You can see the volcano behind me.
The Dragon head might be consumed by it.

1365
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:39,670
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
our mid-day deadline is fast approaching,</i>

1366
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:42,302
<i>and I have yet to receive an opening bid.</i>

1367
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:43,632
<i>If the auction is aborted,</i>

1368
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:47,091
<i>MP will dump the bronze Dragon head
into the active volcano in front of us.</i>

1369
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:49,763
Will the Dragon Head
be Thrown into the Volcano?

1370
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:53,055
<i>At this stage,
I haven't received any opening bids.</i>

1371
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:55,099
<i>Fair warning.</i>

1372
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:57,984
<i>Fair warning.</i>

1373
01:29:58,393 --> 01:29:59,815
<i>Last chance.</i>

1374
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:03,111
<i>This item is unsold!</i>

1375
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:09,659
Boss! The Dragon head's
been taken off the auction block.

1376
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:13,325
Dump it!

1377
01:30:16,161 --> 01:30:18,459
All right, guys! Let's do this!

1378
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:28,882
It's really happened.
They've started the mission.

1379
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:30,929
<i>Looking at the three skydivers,</i>

1380
01:30:31,009 --> 01:30:33,307
<i>we can clearly see
one of them is holding the Dragon head.</i>

1381
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:35,514
They're dumping it!
They're dumping it! Look!

1383
01:30:37,724 --> 01:30:38,725
<i>NEWS ANCHOR". For the whole process,</i>

1384
01:30:38,808 --> 01:30:43,735
<i>the MP Corporation has named this mission
"Let the Dragon Fly".</i>

1385
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,827
What is this? A fourth diver has appeared.

1386
01:30:57,619 --> 01:30:59,747
Over there! Look over there!

1387
01:32:56,029 --> 01:32:57,030
Wake up!

1388
01:32:58,656 --> 01:33:00,374
Wake up! Wake up!

1389
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:10,385
Hey! Save her!

1390
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:11,928
Thank you!

1391
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:29,312
He dropped the Dragon's head.
It's falling towards the volcano!

1393
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:05,899
All that's left to do is open their parachutes!
Oh, no, they're still freefalling!

1395
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:18,365
You are a condor without wings.

1396
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:24,208
Don't even think you can beat me.

1397
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,248
No! You're crazy!

1398
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:34,261
Young skydiver is falling.
He does not have parachute.

1399
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:36,884
What will he do with Dragon head?

1401
01:36:31,869 --> 01:36:33,246
It's yours!

1402
01:36:35,373 --> 01:36:38,047
You're really something else, brother.

1403
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:13,919
<i>In our special report,
MP Corporation chief,</i>

1404
01:37:13,995 --> 01:37:16,999
<i>Lawrence Morgan, and his son, Michael,
were arrested</i>

1405
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:20,631
<i>after a priceless stolen painting, the Roses'

1406
01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:21,677
Yes!

1407
01:37:21,753 --> 01:37:23,300
<i>And here's a special story.</i>

1408
01:37:23,379 --> 01:37:26,428
<i>Today, four foreign consuls
each received unmarked packages</i>

1409
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:28,851
<i>containing long lost national treasures.</i>

1410
01:37:28,926 --> 01:37:31,554
<i>They include
an Egyptian pharaoh's golden sceptre</i>

1411
01:37:31,637 --> 01:37:33,935
<i>and Czarina Catherine of Russia's staff.</i>

1412
01:37:34,015 --> 01:37:37,394
<i>And an lncan jewellery box
decorated with a golden eagle.</i>

1413
01:37:37,643 --> 01:37:39,270
<i>And don't forget the Star of Arabia.</i>

1414
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:42,861
<i>Now nobody knows
who this mystery sender is.</i>

1415
01:37:43,149 --> 01:37:44,401
<i>Quite amazing, isn't it?</i>

1416
01:37:44,901 --> 01:37:47,199
<i>In similar news, Japan has just announced</i>

1417
01:37:47,278 --> 01:37:50,908
<i>that it will return five ancient Korean books
to South Korea.</i>

1418
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:52,037
<i>Next up. .</i> .

1419
01:37:52,116 --> 01:37:53,083
Yeah!

1420
01:37:53,159 --> 01:37:55,082
Hey! My name is Anna.

1421
01:37:55,161 --> 01:37:57,630
On behalf of the
Association of Cultural Preservation,

1422
01:37:57,705 --> 01:37:59,799
I give you this <i>as</i> a token of our appreciation.

1423
01:38:00,333 --> 01:38:01,835
Thank you very much.

1424
01:38:01,918 --> 01:38:04,387
No need.
He's sold more than he's given back.

1425
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:07,302
Look, Professor Guan's been freed.

1426
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:11,303
- Mr Liao, your wife has just given birth!
-I'm coming!

1427
01:38:11,761 --> 01:38:13,559
- I got to go!
- Just go. Go. See you.

1428
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:14,935
- I'll go see.
- JC.

1429
01:38:16,015 --> 01:38:17,062
You're the man!

1430
01:38:18,059 --> 01:38:20,653
<i>You asked me out,
and you're still not here!</i>

1431
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:22,822
This voicemail's really loud. Listen. See ya.

1432
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:26,322
<i>I've eaten every cuisine and I had dessert!
Don't call me any more!</i>

1433
01:38:26,609 --> 01:38:28,828

- Goodbye!

1434
01:38:29,112 --> 01:38:30,409
- Catherine!
- Catherine.

1435
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:32,991
- I have something for you.
- See you.

1436
01:38:33,366 --> 01:38:34,663
<i>Emperor Qianlong's Autumn Hunt?</i>

1437
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:36,790
I learned from you. I stole it!

1438
01:38:36,869 --> 01:38:38,667
Bankers won't know
how to appreciate it anyway.

1439
01:38:38,746 --> 01:38:39,747
You...

1440
01:38:39,831 --> 01:38:42,835
Since we parted, I've been learning Chinese.

1441
01:38:45,128 --> 01:38:46,721
- A present from my sister.
- Thank you.

1442
01:38:50,007 --> 01:38:51,224
"Purple!
"Purple!

1443
01:38:52,218 --> 01:38:53,265
HOW is JC?

1444
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:54,345
He's awake. You can go and see him.

1445
01:38:54,429 --> 01:38:55,772
I'll go to see him now.

1446
01:38:55,847 --> 01:38:56,973
Okay-

1447
01:38:57,598 --> 01:38:59,191
<i>Emperor Qianlong's Autumn Hunt!
Let's see it!</i>

1448
01:39:01,853 --> 01:39:03,150
Go and try to settle it.

1449
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:06,190
Mama!

1450
01:39:11,446 --> 01:39:13,665
Only the efforts
of two half-decent people

1451
01:39:13,739 --> 01:39:16,242
can give her a decent environment
to grow up in.

1452
01:39:16,325 --> 01:39:17,497
<i>30"'!</i>

1453
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:23,253
If you're willing, we can start this over.

1454
01:39:28,546 --> 01:39:31,516
Hey! It's a girl! Come and see! Come and see!

1455
01:39:32,258 --> 01:39:34,306
Congratulations! What's her name?

1456
01:39:34,385 --> 01:39:36,638
- Pax. It's Latin for "peace".
- Pax?

1457
01:39:36,721 --> 01:39:38,394
JC gave me four names, and I...

1458
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:40,983
- Sister?
- Sister?

1459
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:45,188
- Who's she?
- She's the woman from the voice-mail.

1460
01:39:45,271 --> 01:39:47,569
- Let's see.
- I'll be right back.

1461
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:54,364
Come here. Come here. Here.

1462
01:39:54,739 --> 01:39:55,740
Who is she?

1463
01:39:56,115 --> 01:39:58,163
He's going to be fine.
In fact, he is healing quickly.

1464
01:39:58,242 --> 01:40:00,836
Well, you should be able to check him out of
here within a week or two.

1465
01:40:00,912 --> 01:40:02,038
Thank you.

1466
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:08,757
- I was just thinking...
-it's okay.

1467
01:40:09,212 --> 01:40:13,012
That was an old message.
Now that I know what you've been up to...

1468
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:14,262
Get up!

1470
01:40:20,973 --> 01:40:22,190
Action!

1473
01:40:51,963 --> 01:40:52,964
I burned my hand.

1474
01:40:55,758 --> 01:40:57,886
Get the dogs!
Control them!

1476
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:03,808
Trainer! Trainer!

1477
01:41:35,673 --> 01:41:39,303
Jackie! Don't stand too close
to the edge! It's dangerous!

1478
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:45,854
I just saw the volcano explode next to me.

1479
01:41:47,226 --> 01:41:49,775
Don't worry. Volcanoes are scared of me.

1481
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:20,643
You really slapped me!

1482
01:42:30,519 --> 01:42:32,146
NG, stupid!

1483
01:43:01,634 --> 01:43:02,635
Was it okay?

1484
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:05,354
We were not the same.
We are...

1485
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:07,272
"We are not the same.

1486
01:43:07,473 --> 01:43:09,817
"We will never do what he does."

1487
01:43:10,309 --> 01:43:11,526
Stay clear.

1488
01:43:11,602 --> 01:43:12,945
Chubby, let's have some smoke!

1489
01:43:13,729 --> 01:43:14,981
Three, two...

1490
01:43:25,116 --> 01:43:26,789
Even machines understand me.

1491
01:43:29,453 --> 01:43:31,126
Everybody, hold!

1492
01:45:42,503 --> 01:45:47,179
<i>Every time I do a dangerous
action scene, I get really, really scared.</i>

1493
01:45:47,258 --> 01:45:48,976
<i>A lot goes through my mind,</i>

1494
01:45:49,051 --> 01:45:54,023
<i>like, "Maybe this is my last scene",
or "Maybe this is my last shot in my life."</i>

1495
01:48:07,147 --> 01:48:11,573
<i>One day, I can proudly tell
my grandchildren that this was me,</i>

1496
01:48:11,652 --> 01:48:13,120
<i>this was Jackie Chan.</i>

1497
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:15,455
<i>I am so proud of myself.</i>

1498
01:48:16,031 --> 01:48:17,624
<i>I want to take this time</i>

1499
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:22,251
<i>to thank my fans from all of the world,
for your continuous support,</i>

1500
01:48:23,038 --> 01:48:24,836
<i>positive or negative,</i>

1501
01:48:25,332 --> 01:48:29,337
<i>I've learnt a lot from your feedback.
It makes me who I am today.</i>

1502
01:48:29,712 --> 01:48:33,842
<i>I would love to keep making movies
that the whole world will enjoy.</i>

1504
01:48:35,801 --> 01:48:37,428
<i>I am Jackie Chan.</i>

1505
01:48:38,095 --> 01:48:39,438
<i>Thank you.</i>
