1
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,122
<i>...want it that way</i>

2
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,920
Don't look at me when
you sing that part.

3
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,202
Feel it!
Ugh.

4
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,931
<i>That way</i>

5
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,331
Man,
that was pretty fun.

6
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,766
What happened, man?

7
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,810
It's not a solo group. I
needed you up there with me.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,048
That's why none of those
kids had solo careers.

9
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,531
I meant us.

10
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,175
What are you talking about?

11
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,611
Remember when we
first moved here...

12
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,649
and we said if we didn't make
it by the time we were 30...

13
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,046
we would move back to Ohio?

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,804
Remember that?
Yeah.

15
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,724
We're 30 as shit right now.

16
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,803
And tomorrow you're gonna
sell your game, J.

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,964
That's a guarantee, dude.

18
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,329
And also, they're running
my commercial again.

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,135
Why would you want
them to run that?

20
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,241
What do you mean?
It's great exposure.

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,415
Is it?

22
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,495
I have.

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,055
I have.
I have.

24
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,082
Genital herpes.

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,885
Dude, I got $11,000
from that commercial.

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,650
I've been living
off that for 2 years.

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,528
Oh, just go talk to her,
you pussy.

28
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,084
You want me to open for you?
I do not.

29
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,571
I'll be happy to open for you.

30
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,728
The last girl you had sex
with was 55 years old.

31
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,609
Don't bring Jane
into this, dude.

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,884
What was I supposed to say?

33
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,845
"Hi, I'm a 30-year-old assistant
at a video game company."

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,530
"Wanna meet my roommate?"

35
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,689
L.A. doesn't work
like that, dude.

36
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,605
Fucking piece of shit!

37
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,415
Come on, do not do this
to me right now, Bro.

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,895
Piece of shit!

39
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,250
What the...!
I hear you, dude!

40
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,535
One second!

41
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,961
I don't need the lights in my face.
I hear you!

42
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,963
Should I reverse into him?
Absolutely not.

43
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,526
Just go!
What?

44
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,927
Oh, no, you gotta be kidding me.

45
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,920
Oh, dude, it's bad.
That's real damage.

46
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,964
Hey, dude!

47
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,855
Don't touch car.

48
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,609
You hit my car.
Are you kidding me?

49
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,046
Ryan, chill.
I'll get proof.

50
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,615
What the fuck?

51
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,449
You need to watch
who you take picture of.

52
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,680
Don't touch my friend, man!

53
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,769
What? I said get
away from my friend.

54
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,561
Ryan.

55
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,690
I need your
insurance information.

56
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,080
Hey! Whoa, whoa!

57
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,646
Hey, get their plates, man!

58
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,603
They don't have plates!
Damn it.

59
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,760
Hey, nobody move. You
guys are all witnesses.

60
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,935
What's up, guys?

61
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,485
How's everybody doing?

62
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,801
Everybody's good?

63
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,889
Cool. Cool. Um...

64
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,810
This...

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,287
is a character-driven
action game.

66
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,209
But don't think of it as a game.

67
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,204
Think of it as
a real life experience.

68
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,203
You are a cop,
put in real life...

69
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,970
Okay, stop. Stop.

70
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,326
Shut that shit off.

71
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,131
Okay.

72
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,848
Spare me the corny gimmicks.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,684
What's the game about?

74
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,726
Um, it's called "Patrolman."

75
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,041
Patrol-Man. Huh.

76
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,160
I like that. What kind of
superpowers does he have?

77
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,731
Check out this girl's pussy.

78
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,885
Oh, no, it's a cop, so he doesn't
have any superpowers or anything.

79
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,690
What does he have?

80
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,571
Is he a vampire,
or anything original?

81
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,484
You know
what's original?

82
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,935
Firefighters.

83
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,455
Yes.
Firefighters? Okay.

84
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,735
Who wants to be a cop?

85
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,615
I wanna shoot at cops.
I don't wanna be one.

86
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,801
Good point.

87
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,095
If I can just show
you guys the game.

88
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,175
Cops are actually really cool.

89
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,361
No, they're not.
Shut up.

90
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,045
You know what's really cool?

91
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,201
Zombies.

92
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,364
I want you to start working on
"Firefighters versus Zombies."

93
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,885
That's genius.
Boom!

94
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,361
What if it was a war between
firefighters and zombies?

95
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,726
Post-apocalyptic.

96
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,606
Set it in New York City and destroy Manhattan.
Hey. You writing this down?

97
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,770
<i>All right,
we can win this!</i>

98
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,402
Razor-15! 1-4-5! Hut!

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,082
1 Mississippi, 2
Mississippi, 3 Mississippi...

100
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,521
I'm open!

101
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,480
5 Mississippi, 6 Mississippi,
7 Mississippi...

102
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,045
Come on, I'm wide open!

103
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,055
<i>Rock you like a hurricane</i>

104
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,605
<i>Are you ready, baby?</i>

105
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,410
<i>Here I am</i>

106
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,444
<i>Rock you like a hurricane</i>

107
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,081
Eat shit, Joey.

108
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,965
<i>Rock you like a hurricane</i>

109
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,164
<i>Here I am</i>

110
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,930
Whoa, ho-ho!

111
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,247
Yes!

112
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,601
This is good.
Everybody, huddle up!

113
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,047
Tommy, you gotta
block a little bit.

114
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,770
Use your heart.
You block like a bitch.

115
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,921
You're a ball hog!

116
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,081
Man up!

117
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,930
Joey, did you see that shit?

118
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,491
Dude, that shit was tight.
Right?

119
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,721
Shut up, Joey.

120
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,135
Hey, don't tell him to shut up.

121
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,969
Come on.
We're out of here.

122
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,441
Where are you guys going?

123
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,931
Home!

124
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,855
What the fuck, Ron?

125
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,450
It is a tie game!

126
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,126
You will not go pro
with that attitude, Ron!

127
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,481
You didn't go pro!

128
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,927
I got injured, man!
What's your excuse?

129
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,923
What do you do all day, anyway?

130
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,809
What do you do all day?
Hang out with Ron?

131
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,961
Shut up!

132
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,281
Why don't you shut up, Ron?

133
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,935
Who is that guy?

134
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,015
Some loser.

135
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,281
He shows up every day and
he thinks he's our coach.

136
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,006
Ron's getting in my
fucking head, dude.

137
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,490
Hello?

138
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,921
Ow!

139
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,651
Why would you do that?

140
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,325
Why'd you hit me in the face?

141
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,766
You don't jump out on brothers.

142
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,200
We don't like that,
you know that!

143
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,768
I was just trying to show you
the costume for tonight.

144
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,160
God!

145
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,645
So how did we do today?

146
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,647
They... bought it.

147
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,683
Green light.
Yeah!

148
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,281
Oh, I'm so happy for you!
I knew it! Yeah!

149
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,966
And that's why we're going
to the party tonight in style.

150
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,326
Do you really wanna do that?

151
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,005
It's gonna be like
a college reunion.

152
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,800
Yes!

153
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,530
I don't know, man.

154
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,160
I mean, they're throwing a costume
party in the middle of June.

155
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,685
That's what the e-vite said.

156
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,841
I don't know.
It doesn't make sense.

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,240
I'll tell you what makes sense.

158
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,491
Us kicking ass and taking names.
We're ghosts.

159
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,080
You look ridiculous.

160
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,690
Then how about those?

161
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,691
My cop stuff?

162
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,171
No.
Why not?

163
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,855
No.
Then how about this, you fucking downer...

164
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,882
Cops or ghosts?
Your choice.

165
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,041
We look ridiculous.

166
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,362
What are you talking about?
We look badass.

167
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,490
I feel like Danny Glover before
he got too old for this shit.

168
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,523
These vests are really heavy.

169
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,484
Because they're
real bulletproof vests.

170
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,886
They are?
Yeah.

171
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,530
So all this is real?
Everything.

172
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,886
What about the guns?
Are the guns real?

173
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,246
Yeah, but they don't fire.

174
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,205
What is the point of that?

175
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,403
The police are here.

176
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,881
You idiot.

177
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,081
Why am I an idiot?

178
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,369
Because this is not a costume
party, it's a masquerade party.

179
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,090
That's the same thing.

180
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,288
Not the same thing.
Not the same thing.

181
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,695
Okay, relax.

182
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,335
Not the same thing.
Where are you going?

183
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,600
Hey, man! Congrats!

184
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,529
Oh, it's Justin!
Hey!

185
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,735
Ryan said you were a big time
video game designer now.

186
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,046
Oh.

187
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,645
I wouldn't say big time...

188
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,449
but I
definitely work on games.

189
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,246
Come on! He said you just got
done selling some huge game!

190
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,284
What's it called? I'm gonna
tweet that shit out.

191
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,081
Um...

192
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,923
Patrolman versus Zombies...

193
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,650
Patrol-Man
versus Zombies, okay.

194
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,040
Versus Firefighters.

195
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,960
Patrol-Man versus Zombies
versus Firefighters.

196
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,129
Good seeing you.

197
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,015
<i>What a game this has been.</i>

198
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,646
<i>It's been back and
forth the entire game.</i>

199
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,770
<i>Heck of a performance
from this guy...</i>

200
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,241
<i>Senior Quarterback,
Ryan O'Malley...</i>

201
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,131
Hey, who's that handsome guy?

202
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,966
<i>O'Malley takes the snap,
avoids the blitz.</i>

203
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,851
<i>Nobody's open. O'Malley
is gonna take it himself.</i>

204
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,287
<i>He cuts across the field,
leaving Chandler in the dust.</i>

205
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,131
<i>He's at the twenty.
Two men to beat. Ten.</i>

206
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,124
<i>Five. Touchdown!</i>

207
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,130
<i>He made it! What a run!</i>

208
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,448
<i>O'Malley did it. He made it!</i>

209
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,975
<i>What a run!</i>

210
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,810
<i>Ryan O'Malley has just delivered
one of the greatest...</i>

211
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,485
But I knew I could
beat the outside.

212
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,575
<i>This has been a stellar
performance by O'Malley...</i>

213
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,329
<i>the young player
who we're hoping</i>

214
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,209
<i>to see a lot of in the future...</i>

215
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,521
O'Malley!

216
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,286
Oh, yeah!

217
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,161
Oh! Everybody's here!
Great to see you guys!

218
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,810
I was just watching the play.

219
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,006
What happened? We all thought
you would have gone pro.

220
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,323
Yeah, definitely.
You know, with the injury...

221
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,965
Didn't I see you in a
herpes commercial, though?

222
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,248
Yeah, you did!
I killed that, right?

223
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,495
So you're an actor now?

224
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,046
No, they found me
in a mall, dude.

225
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,242
No, I've been
mentoring some kids...

226
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,050
teach some football, the
ins and outs of the game.

227
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,415
How to play it right.

228
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,647
You know, just to give back
to the community.

229
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,325
But what's your job?

230
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,855
Yeah, there's odds and ends.

231
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,245
I told you I did
that commercial.

232
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,209
No, I mean, what's your career?

233
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,848
I mean, what do you...

234
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,882
Hey, he's O'Malley, right?
That's his job.

235
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,724
Yeah, man.
Right?

236
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,723
You're out of here? Oh, you
guys are going with him?

237
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,211
Oh, you're all going.

238
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,204
What happened to that guy?

239
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,050
Ryan.

240
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,565
Wait up.

241
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,721
I didn't sell my game today.

242
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,930
I know, Justin.

243
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,562
L.A.'s not
for me, dude.

244
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,888
I'm moving back to Ohio.

245
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,085
Are you all right?

246
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,289
Me too, man.

247
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,445
Me too.

248
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,169
<i>This magic moment</i>

249
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,615
<i>So different and so new</i>

250
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,246
<i>Was like any other</i>

251
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,851
<i>Until I met you</i>

252
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,815
<i>And then it happened</i>

253
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,127
Officer!

254
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,285
Officer!

255
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,295
Scavenger hunt! We all
have to kiss a cop!

256
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,561
<i>Everything I want I have</i>

257
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,809
<i>Whenever I hold you tight</i>

258
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,120
<i>This magic moment</i>

259
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,935
That was different.

260
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,291
Yeah.

261
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,331
Freeze!

262
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,650
You guys over there, freeze!

263
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,968
Everybody freeze.

264
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,806
What the fuck?

265
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,803
Carry on.
Everybody be safe.

266
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,321
Carry on.

267
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,565
I got my eyes on you, Jack.

268
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,721
Carry on.

269
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,285
Goodness.

270
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,368
Justin, you've got to try it.

271
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,295
Police! Freeze!

272
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,375
Oh!

273
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,775
My bad, dude.

274
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,961
Stupid pigs.

275
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,525
Stay in school.

276
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,565
Yep, they think we're real.

277
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,848
So, let's be cops.

278
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,495
Well-well-well.
What do we have here?

279
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,210
What you got in your hand there?

280
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,050
Oh, a joint.

281
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,930
Officers, this is...

282
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,488
That's some
really good weed, man.

283
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,764
Is this for real?

284
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,881
Go.

285
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,451
Do not exhale, man. Just keep it in.
Be cool.

286
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,563
Be cool, Justin, we're good.

287
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,248
Even the cops think
we're cops, Justin.

288
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,081
Yeah!

289
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,287
Hey, look who it is.

290
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,200
Look, dude.

291
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,415
I knew we'd see
these dicks again.

292
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,735
Hey, pull over.

293
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,895
Are you serious?
I'm serious.

294
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,285
They're at Georgie's.
Pull over.

295
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,004
This is not right.
I make my payments.

296
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,731
I don't talk. We have
been here 32 years.

297
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,406
This is my whole life.
This is my family.

298
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,050
Georgie, be smart.

299
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,409
When Mossi admires your
business, you make him partner.

300
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,005
But I never asked for a partner.

301
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,362
He no your ask permission.

302
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,410
You realize we're
not real cops, right?

303
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,607
Just watch my 6.

304
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,285
Your 6?
My backup.

305
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,695
Don't use the lingo.

306
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,655
Oh, fuck you. I'm using the lingo.
The lingo's half the fun.

307
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,855
Whoo!

308
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,961
We're here.

309
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,607
We got reports of a 418.

310
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,095
What? Why don't you tell
them what a 418 is?

311
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,963
I don't know.
Tell them.

312
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,164
And I gotta say,
you look suspicious, buddy.

313
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,483
Hands where I can see them.
All of you.

314
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,324
Hands where I can see them!

315
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,010
What's going on
over there? Come on.

316
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,926
Get my 6.
Don't say that.

317
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,527
What the...?

318
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,161
Hey, you two,
get up here. Now.

319
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,211
Do I know you?
You do now.

320
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,328
Everybody outside. Now.

321
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,806
Now!

322
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,240
Outside!

323
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,041
All right, turn around.
Hands against the car.

324
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,520
Now. Hands against the car.

325
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,806
Dude.

326
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,455
Take my photo.

327
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,050
For what?
For Facebook.

328
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,366
Thank you.

329
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,811
All right, turn around, guys.

330
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,530
Chop chop, guys.
Turn around.

331
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,168
This vehicle was involved in a
hit-and-run the other night.

332
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,327
And the car you hit
was very expensive.

333
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,204
The car was worth anywhere
between $15,000 and $27,000.

334
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,175
27...

335
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,495
$27,000.

336
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,655
Partner...
My bad.

337
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,684
Give them a sobriety test.
I'm gonna 402 the vehicle.

338
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,166
What's a 402?

339
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,249
Search and seizure.

340
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,729
Hey, guys.

341
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,845
How's your night going?

342
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,210
402.

343
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,929
Hands on your head, please.

344
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,205
Do a couple of spins for me.

345
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,886
That's good.

346
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,166
Okay.

347
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,204
You can't drive around...

348
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,928
with bourbon in your...

349
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,081
What else?

350
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,890
Pelvic thrusts. Hands still
up there, pelvic thrusts.

351
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,085
Yeah, like that.

352
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,844
What? What? What?

353
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,561
Ho-ho!

354
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,561
Yeah!

355
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,081
Now...

356
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,250
bust it wide open.

357
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,055
You gotta see what's
going on back there.

358
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,570
What's going on back there?

359
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,649
Pop that.
Earn that money.

360
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,922
Dance like you just found
out you're pregnant.

361
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,771
That's laundry for a week.
Thank you, gentlemen.

362
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,411
Yeah!

363
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,285
When did you guys stop dancing?

364
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,411
And that goes there.

365
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,080
Well, I hope we all
learned a lesson here.

366
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,335
Now who are you?

367
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,691
Who are we?

368
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,330
Why don't you tell
these men who we are?

369
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,403
We're the law, bitch.

370
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,971
Yeah!
That was cool, man.

371
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,770
It felt so good.
Yeah!

372
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,446
You heard him.
We're the law, bitch.

373
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,446
We're the new
sheriffs in town. Okay?

374
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,530
Now get in your car and get out.

375
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,646
Now.

376
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,970
Yeah! All right!

377
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,970
This is what we needed, buddy.

378
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,525
How far are we planning
on taking this, dude?

379
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,415
Why do you ruin everything
by thinking about it?

380
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,441
Just enjoy the night.

381
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,806
Hey, um...

382
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,169
I'm sorry. I had no idea
that you were a cop.

383
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,321
Oh.

384
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,164
No, I'm not really a cop.

385
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,375
What do you mean?

386
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,935
We're more than cops.

387
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,201
Yeah, we help all
the intense units.

388
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,805
SWAT, FBI.

389
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,162
The other day,
we were on a 5150...

390
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,529
and this guy comes off with
a sawed-off shotgun, right?

391
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,960
Bang, bang, bang!

392
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,161
Dude, what are you...

393
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,163
I look behind me
and J-Rock...

394
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,364
puts one in the chest
and two in the balls.

395
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,971
One in each ball.

396
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,246
Wow, really?

397
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,935
No, I don't shoot testicles.

398
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,883
Do not let that
humble face fool you.

399
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,964
And we all at the force talk about it.
We think he needs a serious...

400
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,083
back massage.

401
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,001
Okay.

402
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,055
Uh, I'm Josie.

403
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,335
Oh, nice to meet you.

404
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,010
Nice to meet you, too...

405
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,961
Chang.

406
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,295
Oh...

407
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,687
Chang. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

408
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,175
Chang, yeah.

409
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,601
That's my name.
It's a family name.

410
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,370
Chang you very much.

411
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,004
That was racist.
I'm sorry.

412
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,400
You're funny.

413
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,601
I'm sure I will see you
around, Officer Chang.

414
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,044
Oh, my lord!

415
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,841
Ooh!

416
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,448
She likes you, Justin.

417
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,125
You do not mess with the law!

418
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,210
You don't mess with the law!
Yeah, yeah!

419
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,051
Yeah!

420
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,800
We have problem.

421
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,887
Cops stopped us from
getting Georgie to sign.

422
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,810
What kind of cops?

423
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,809
Hic-cops?

424
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,606
Yeah.

425
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,921
Did they buy you a donut?

426
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,291
Now find me those cops.

427
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,204
<i>Police
hand signals are crucial</i>

428
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,129
<i>in life-threatening
situations.</i>

429
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,681
<i>The most important
hand signal is Code 4.</i>

430
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,644
<i>Code 4 means,
"All clear."</i>

431
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,171
<i>"We're all good here."</i>

432
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,482
Code 4. All clear.

433
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,489
<i>What is Code 387?</i>
Grand Theft.

434
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,324
<i>What is Code 287?</i>
Kidnapping.

435
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,775
Watch your surroundings.

436
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,404
Control the situation.

437
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,687
<i>Remember the
3 essential steps of self-defense.</i>

438
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,880
Absolutely. It's all the
technique I told you about.

439
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,775
Okay?
Let's Way, Joey.

440
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,161
Try to kill me.

441
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,655
You're the bad guy. You're the
crackhead, I'm the cop. Go.

442
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,001
Come at me.
Come at me.

443
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,120
You stabbed me, you son-of-a-bitch!
Sorry.

444
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,880
Whoo!

445
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,050
All right!
What you got going, my dude?

446
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,295
<i>Whatever we want!
We're cops!</i>

447
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,851
Oh, shit.

448
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,560
Oh, shit, dude.
I'm getting pulled over.

449
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,727
<i>Play it cool, Chang.</i>

450
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,531
Play it cool? I can't play it cool.
I'm black!

451
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,443
<i>Turn off the
engine and step out of the car.</i>

452
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,127
Okay. I'm getting out.

453
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,370
<i>Hands on top of your head.</i>

454
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,204
Okay.

455
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,888
Are you
wearing an LAPD uniform?

456
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,610
Officer, I can explain...
Turn around!

457
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,450
Spread your legs.

458
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,575
Don't fight it!

459
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,045
Officer,
what are you doing?

460
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,810
Whoo!
Officer!

461
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,450
I'm gonna ride you!

462
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,895
Oh, my gosh!

463
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,126
What is wrong with you?

464
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,489
You should have
seen your face, man!

465
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,122
Wow. Where did
you get this?

466
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,415
eBay, dude.

467
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,408
eBay?
Yeah, there's tons of them.

468
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,090
Isn't this so illegal?

469
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,401
No.

470
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,604
Well, I mean, yeah.

471
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,165
Putting the lights on
kind of is.

472
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,563
<i>I had to do that myself.</i>

473
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,091
What about the LAPD shit.

474
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,241
Got it online.

475
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,164
Then I went to Kinko's.
Kinko's?

476
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,965
<i>Plastered it on myself.</i>

477
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,441
This is crazy, dude.

478
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,003
Some next level shit
is what it is, Justin.

479
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,969
Some next level shit.

480
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,643
<i>Load it up and crack a trick</i>

481
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,246
<i>I'm above the law, bitch</i>

482
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,650
Isn't that the guy who took
a shit on our doorstep?

483
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,131
He's a cop.

484
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,923
<i>Everybody get down</i>

485
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,135
Officers,
is there a problem?

486
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,685
Do you want to go
to jail tonight?

487
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,161
Um...

488
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,369
There you guys are!

489
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,015
What are you
talking about?

490
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,486
Somewhere fun.

491
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,210
All right!

492
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,326
Oh, yeah!

493
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,486
Damn!

494
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,889
Oh, no, no, no. We're real cops.
These are our guns and...

495
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,690
We paid $500 for your asses.

496
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,400
Now get up there
and shake those dicks!

497
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,886
That's right!

498
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,170
I'm getting fucked tonight.

499
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,410
Take it off.

500
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,085
Come to mama.

501
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,731
Oh, yeah!

502
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,531
Get your dollar
bills ready, girls.

503
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,841
Make it flash!

504
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,690
No touching!

505
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,561
Stop, guys!

506
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,405
Can I just dance?

507
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,730
Ew.
What?

508
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,255
Oh, gosh.

509
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,282
You get what you pay for.

510
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,686
Ugh.

511
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,762
All right, let's do it again.
Roll up the windows.

512
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,600
Here we go! Here we go!

513
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,411
You look really different
without your uniform.

514
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,929
Is that a compliment
or an insult?

515
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,895
All right, young lady.

516
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,455
I'm the cop here,
so I'll be asking

517
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,403
the remainder of
the questions, ma'am.

518
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,090
Oh, okay.
First off...

519
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,963
How on earth do you
not have a boyfriend?

520
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,522
Honestly, Justin, I have
the worst taste in men.

521
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,803
Thank you.
No, I mean...

522
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,415
I'm a psycho magnet.
I don't know.

523
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,735
Give me an example.

524
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,966
Okay.

525
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,135
Right now, there's this guy who keeps
coming in to my work and bothering me.

526
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,448
And normally, I would just
tell him to get lost...

527
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,168
but he's like real deal scary.

528
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,215
Next time this guy
shows up at your work

529
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,004
you tell him I want his number.

530
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,163
Seriously,
he seems like my type.

531
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,850
Whoa, is that real?

532
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,690
Yeah, it happens sometimes.

533
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,205
I like it.

534
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,011
I like you.

535
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,000
Listen, I gotta
tell you something.

536
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,415
What?

537
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,249
And it's gonna sound crazy.

538
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,489
<i>Officer Chang,
this is the LAPD...</i>

539
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,042
<i>I'm gonna need you to stop creeping
out that girl and get back to work.</i>

540
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,443
All right!

541
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,641
I have to tell her.

542
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,006
She's too good of a girl, man.

543
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,686
And now she's sitting over here
thinking I'm Denzel in <i>Training Day.</i>

544
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,205
More like Ethan Hawke.

545
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,851
What's that?
What are those?

546
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,001
Oh, this?

547
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,207
You sew those on?

548
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,495
I got promoted to sergeant.

549
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,010
You promoted yourself?

550
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,207
I feel like I deserved it.

551
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,691
I don't want you getting
too weird with this.

552
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,205
I'm not getting
too weird, Chang!

553
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,406
Stop calling me Chang.

554
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,329
Look at your nametag.

555
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,095
I would love to
meet the 6-foot-1

556
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,770
Chinese guy that
can fit this outfit.

557
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,763
<i>All units, all
units, we have a 2735 in progress...</i>

558
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,135
Stop, I wanna hear this.

559
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,335
<i>A 2735 in progress...</i>

560
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,567
Domestic disturbance.
Sweet. Let's hit that shit.

561
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,881
No. What are you doing?

562
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,405
Yes.
No!

563
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,925
Yes, let's get in the shit.

564
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,531
No!

565
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,055
Don't!

566
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,047
We're getting in the shit!
We're not getting in the shit!

567
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,255
We're getting in the shit! No!

568
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,415
I'm a sergeant!

569
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,895
Oh, I'm gonna kill you, Justin.

570
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,410
I'm gonna kill you.

571
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,375
<i>Reported
suspects are 3 females,</i>

572
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,050
<i>early 20's,
possibly intoxicated.</i>

573
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,282
Oh, that's how it's sweet.

574
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,368
Light them cherries up! Whoo!

575
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,640
What if the real cops come?

576
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,535
Are you kidding? It'll
take at least an hour.

577
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,335
It's a domestic
disturbance call.

578
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,575
How do you know that?

579
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,602
Would you shut up and
let me do my job here?

580
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,967
Wait, wait, wait.
What?

581
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,415
What's the plan?

582
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,966
The plan is we
control the situation.

583
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,122
That's what the YouTube video said.
YouTube?

584
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,970
Police! Open up!

585
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,451
I'm gonna wait in the car, Bro.
Chang!

586
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,443
Get your ass back here right now.
You're my partner...

587
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,284
Thank God you're here!

588
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,130
Oh, yeah, thank God we are here.

589
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,248
Absolutely. What seems
to be the problem, ma'am?

590
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,244
It's my sorority sisters.
Please hurry and come in.

591
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,451
Sorority sisters.

592
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,165
Oh, I thought you said you were
gonna wait in the car, Chang.

593
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,966
I'm not.

594
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,920
I thought you said you were
gonna wait in the car.

595
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,650
Stand down.
You stand down!

596
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,375
I'm the sergeant, Chang.
I'm going first.

597
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,606
What the hell?

598
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,205
You need to get out.

599
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,810
Well, I'm out.

600
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,122
Chang. Chang!

601
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,362
We gotta control the situation.

602
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,602
Are you kidding me?

603
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,970
Hey, hey!
You need to stop!

604
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,009
I'm controlling the situation!

605
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,525
You need to give me the phone!
You're gonna get your ass whooped!

606
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,727
Help!

607
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,924
I will control
the situation... Ow!

608
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,890
Chang, help!

609
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,695
All right!

610
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,846
Don't touch me!

611
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,001
Calm down, sir!

612
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,321
Excuse me?

613
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,209
That's a ma'am!
Oh.

614
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,561
Oh.

615
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,963
You guys seem like
two classy ladies.

616
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,485
Let's handle this like adults.
Yes.

617
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,971
What is your name?
Precious.

618
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,335
She ain't that precious.
What is your real name?

619
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,495
Precious.

620
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,646
Yeah, but when you were
born, what did your...

621
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,643
Not your gang name
or your stripper name.

622
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,961
Precious.

623
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,561
Ma'am, for the last time,
what is your name?

624
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,015
It's Precious.

625
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,691
Precious, okay, that's cool.
That's a very pretty name.

626
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,043
So Precious, great name, why don't
you tell us what's going on here?

627
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,010
I'll tell you what's going on! She's
trying to get with my man behind my back!

628
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,209
I ain't trying shit!
Her man be texting me!

629
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,362
Hell no!
You're a lying-ass bitch!

630
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,887
You call me a bitch again,
bitch, and see what happens!

631
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,246
Just don't call her
a bitch again, okay?

632
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,606
Here's what we're gonna do.
Give me your phone.

633
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,841
What you doing?
Stop!

634
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,201
I'm gonna go home.

635
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,049
Stop it, we're cops.
Act like it.

636
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,403
I will be reading the part of
D'Andre, the man in question.

637
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,048
JaQuandae!
JaQuandae.

638
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,655
You read JaQuanda.

639
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,886
I'm not gonna do that.

640
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,565
"What are you doing?"

641
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,935
Why do you get to read the boy?

642
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,086
Justin!!

643
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,046
"What are you doing?"

644
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,695
"Eating soup."

645
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,449
"Trying to lose some
weight and stuff."

646
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,726
And I did.

647
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,611
"Girl, you ain't gotta lose shit."
JaQUANDAE: Thank you.

648
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,086
"'Cause you fine
as wine."

649
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,290
"Look, D'Andre, Don't be
texting me again, okay?"

650
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,521
You see?

651
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,722
"Unless you wanna get
them nuts up in my guts."

652
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,087
Oh, that's sex!
That's sex!

653
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,645
You can win this, J!

654
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,211
What are you crazy?

655
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,928
Oh!

656
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,442
I'm sorry!
Oh no, you didn't!

657
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,451
Oh, ho-ho! I felt it!

658
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,405
I felt the squish!

659
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,608
You hit my girl!
Why would you do that?

660
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,123
J, control
the situation!

661
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,607
No!

662
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,566
That's what you get!

663
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,088
Don't even say it.

664
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,083
That's what you get.

665
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,695
Does this hurt?

666
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,041
Ouch. Yeah.

667
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,215
Ooh.
Still hurts.

668
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,686
How many bad guys were there?
Um...

669
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,764
Two, but the little girl,
she could really fight.

670
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,086
She?
What?

671
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,495
You said she.

672
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,415
No, I didn't. Why would I say she?
I fight guys.

673
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,566
Whoa! Whoa.

674
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,205
Okay, now that scares the
shit out of me, for real.

675
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,885
Thank you.
Wow.

676
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,849
It's cool that you're a make-up artist.
That's awesome.

677
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,570
Yeah, trying to be.

678
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,007
What do you mean?
I don't know.

679
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,243
I'm not a make-up artist.
I'm a waitress.

680
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,169
When do I face
reality and just...

681
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,810
You can't give up on a dream.

682
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,610
Look at all this
work you've done.

683
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,570
That's the last
thing you wanna do.

684
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,120
Or else you're gonna regret
it for the rest of your life.

685
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,001
Yeah, I guess so.

686
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,206
It's pretty insightful
for a badass cop.

687
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,930
Okay, Josie, wait.

688
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,121
Um...

689
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,280
I gotta tell you something.

690
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,006
This...

691
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,249
This is not me.
It's not.

692
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,888
Josie. Please.

693
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,295
Okay, Josie...

694
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,655
I need to tell you something.
I'm not a cop, okay?

695
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,855
I am a cop.

696
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,770
Holy fuck, I'm a cop!
I'm a motherfucking cop!

697
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,921
Wow.

698
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,203
Wow.
Wait, what?

699
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,935
No, whoa, what I meant
to say is...

700
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,611
I'm not a good cop.
For you, I'm not.

701
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,921
Yeah, put those away.

702
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,525
It's hard to concentrate.

703
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,883
Oh, my
God, I'm so hot.

704
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,602
Oh, my gosh.
Why didn't you tell me?

705
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,001
Oh, no, no, no. I'm all me.
I like ladies.

706
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,764
I'm a lady's man, baby.

707
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,644
You really need to stop talking.

708
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,089
I'm so proud
of you, Chang.

709
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,810
We just kissed, dude.

710
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,689
But the next time I see her,
I'm telling her the truth.

711
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,524
But tonight we're going big.

712
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,735
Yeah, man!

713
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,841
<i>Because we're cops</i>

714
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,161
<i>Cops
Cops</i>

715
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,255
<i>Trying to earn a living</i>

716
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,282
Hey, hey,
hey, shut up, actually.

717
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,520
Oh, shit!
We're fine. Relax.

718
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,801
Oh, shit!

719
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,684
Pull over! Fuck!

720
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,095
Oh, damn it.

721
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,281
Shit, we're gonna go to jail.

722
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,124
I don't wanna go to jail.
I don't wanna braid hair.

723
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,089
They hide cell phones in their butts.
Shut up!

724
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,242
We're not going to jail. Just relax.
This will be interesting.

725
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,935
Here's what we're gonna do. On
the count of 3, I'm gonna bolt.

726
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,166
What?

727
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,089
Let's see if they can catch us.
What are you talking about?

728
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,969
Let me handle this. Don't say a word.
Don't do anything stupid.

729
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,930
You don't do anything stupid.
Don't do anything, Ryan.

730
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,081
Honestly, shut up.

731
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,766
Code 4, we're all clear.
Move on.

732
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,360
You don't have any plates
on your vehicle.

733
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,015
We're not sure
what to make of that.

734
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,451
We were on a 288.

735
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,651
While we were inside,
somebody stole our plates.

736
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,485
Is that right?
Mmm-hmm.

737
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,007
That's right.
So I said, Code four.

738
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,535
Move on.

739
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,881
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry, Sergeant.

740
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,241
I didn't see the stripes.

741
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,641
We've been getting a lot of
calls about stolen cop cars.

742
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,281
I'm Officer Segars,
this is Officer Jackson.

743
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,442
Sorry, Sergeant, we should
have called it in first.

744
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,483
Well, goddamn it, guys!

745
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,921
Don't let it happen again, all right?
That's amateur hour.

746
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,280
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

747
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,655
Look, I don't mean to scold you.

748
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,335
I was young and
hungry once, too.

749
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,203
I get it.
I'm Officer O'Malley.

750
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,284
This is my best friend
and partner, Officer Chang.

751
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,130
Best friend, huh, and partner?

752
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,967
Oh, I wish I could say the same.

753
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,168
Listen, I'm kind of
embarrassed about this.

754
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,567
Is there any way I can make it up to you?
We're about to get off.

755
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,848
How about we take you guys out
and buy you a couple of drinks?

756
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,769
Oh...
To a cool cop bar?

757
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,691
Yeah, it's the coolest.

758
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,763
If you're buying, we're drinking.
I don't have any money on me.

759
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,321
Well, yeah, the first round.

760
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,684
I'm sorry. Unfortunately,
we're a little tired.

761
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,683
We had a long day, so we're...

762
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,695
I don't know if you
guys got the memo...

763
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,563
but Chang here is
a bit of a whang.

764
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,963
Hey, let me tell you something.
Jackson here is no peach either.

765
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,929
Non-stop donut farts.

766
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,727
Never a dull moment,
am I right, Sarge?

767
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,962
6-Adam-7. We got a Code
30 at Ace Hardware.

768
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,531
Dude, no!

769
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,886
We're Code 6. Let's go.

770
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,485
No, no, no.
What are you doing?

771
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,449
We're getting their six.
No, we're not!

772
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,281
Wanna take the lead
on this, Sarge?

773
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,442
Me? No, you guys
go ahead.

774
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,446
I'm gonna evaluate you guys,
individually and as a team.

775
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,329
Go. We got eyes on you.

776
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,535
Holy shit.

777
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,601
LAPD!

778
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,806
Los Angeles Police Department!

779
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,766
Shh, shh.

780
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,284
Let's go.
No, no, no.

781
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,563
Don't you crawl.
I'm crawling.

782
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,921
Ow.

783
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,255
What?

784
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,850
What did you do?
I don't know.

785
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,090
Two here.
Okay, great.

786
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,651
Copy that.
What is he saying?

787
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,175
They're going in
from the west perimeter

788
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,531
and we're going to
the east perimeter.

789
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,762
No, we're not going to any perimeter.
Copy that.

790
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,441
Dude, Ryan!

791
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,001
No, no, no!

792
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,495
Your gun's fake.
Let's go.

793
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,885
Shut the fuck up.

794
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,295
Your gun's not real.

795
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,295
Don't touch a shooter's arm!

796
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,760
Come on, pig motherfuckers!

797
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,049
Don't call us pigs!
Where did you get that?

798
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,640
You wanna get weird,
let's get weird.

799
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,285
Oh, my God!

800
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,965
Hold on!
Hold it!

801
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,565
Hold it.
Hold it.

802
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,886
Just take off, all right?
We're not gonna chase you.

803
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,041
Stay right here.
We are gonna chase you.

804
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,531
Do not listen to him.

805
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,846
He's an idiot.
He's an idiot.

806
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,445
You can go.
We are police officers.

807
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,324
I promise you
we won't chase you.

808
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,895
I promise we will chase you,

809
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,968
and I promise I'll
catch you, you rat.

810
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,175
Don't look at him.
I swear to you...

811
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,202
I pinky swear,
we will not chase you.

812
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,522
I pinky swear.
Just touch it.

813
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,487
He almost did it!

814
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,366
Oh, my God.
Okay.

815
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,325
Let me just get this straight.

816
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,721
Did you just
pinky-swear with a perp?

817
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,801
Yeah.

818
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,490
That's the most embarrassing
thing I've ever lived through!

819
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,921
What are you talking about?
Did you see how strong he was?

820
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,800
He looked like Pacquiao
and Fabio had a baby!

821
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,170
Take him, Sarge, take him!

822
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,045
Go ahead. This one's all you.
Nope.

823
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,326
Go ahead.
Nope.

824
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,725
You got it, Sarge!
Watch and learn.

825
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,175
<i>I came in like a wrecking ball</i>

826
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,531
Oh, shit!

827
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,407
<i>I never hit so hard at love</i>

828
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,615
<i>All I wanted was
to break your walls</i>

829
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,455
Oh, my God!

830
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,245
<i>All you ever did was wreck me</i>

831
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,855
Oh, my God!

832
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,405
<i>Yeah, you, you wreck me</i>

833
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,681
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold, hold, hold.

834
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,295
Let me up!
Let me up!

835
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,606
Come here.
There you go!

836
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,205
Way to go, Chang!

837
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,405
Where is the other guy?

838
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,766
What?

839
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,247
What other guy? What
are you talking about?

840
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,481
The other perp.

841
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,935
I think it was just that guy.

842
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,962
You pinky swear about that?

843
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,250
There were 2.
Yeah, 2.

844
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,930
Let's find them
then, guys! Come on!

845
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,684
You take the front, we'll
take the back, all right?

846
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,001
- Yep, absolutely.
- All right.

847
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,400
All right!

848
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,367
Chang. Do not
Tom Cruise run.

849
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,925
Yeah!

850
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,847
Whoo! That is living, man!

851
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,008
I still taste that guy's
sweat in my mouth.

852
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,891
Congratulations. That is
the taste of victory, man.

853
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,485
It's your first collar, dude.

854
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,563
Dude, that was way too close.

855
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,804
Seriously.
What's the worst that could happen?

856
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,575
"Simply wearing
a police badge is

857
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,935
punishable by 1 year
minimum in a federal..."

858
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,175
What the fuck?

859
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,440
"The use of official
police equipment...

860
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,881
is punishable by up to 2 years
in a federal penitentiary."

861
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,002
"Driving a vehicle with red or
blue lights is punishable...

862
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,886
by up to 3 years imprisonment
and $200,000 fine."

863
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,802
What about a whole
damn police car?

864
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,764
<i>Everybody get down</i>

865
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,561
Which one of you little pricks
asked me what I do all day?

866
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,975
I'm a cop.

867
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,764
Joey, hop in.

868
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,160
Out of my way.

869
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,966
Take a lap, little boys.

870
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,521
He's a cop, Ron!

871
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,682
He ain't shit!

872
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,444
I love it, man.

873
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,001
Look, you had a great shift.
You keep it up...

874
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,491
and I'll give you
that badge I promised you.

875
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,290
What the hell
have you been doing?

876
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,169
Jesus, you scared
the shit out of me.

877
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,415
And who is this?

878
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,249
It's Joey.
He's our intern.

879
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,895
Ryan, are you insane?

880
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,135
No.

881
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,730
We could go to jail for
years for this shit.

882
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,245
And now you have
a little kid involved?

883
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,686
Who's this bitch?

884
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,520
I will slap that little
afro off your head.

885
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,649
You're good. Dude,
this is it, all right?

886
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,325
Take the uniform off.
We're throwing them away.

887
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,045
We are done. Seriously.

888
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,202
You wanna retire?

889
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,845
Shit.

890
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,286
This is Chang.
You're good.

891
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,204
<i>I need you to come down here
right away. I'm at Georgie's.</i>

892
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,566
Wait. What's wrong, Josie?

893
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,444
Please come down as
soon as you can. Hurry.

894
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,489
Yeah, but just
tell... Hello?

895
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,927
Damn it.
Did you hear that?

896
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,486
Looks like we're coming out
of retirement, homeboy.

897
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,363
We gotta go around back
to surprise them.

898
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,815
All right,
here's what we're gonna do.

899
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,410
I'm gonna bum-rush in, I'm
gonna say my killer line...

900
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,015
then you come in and
repeat everything I said.

901
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,175
No.

902
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,168
Ready, and...

903
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,330
Yippee-ki-yay, bitches!
Everyone down!

904
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,922
Yippee-ki-yay, bitches...
Everyone...

905
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,648
So you're the new
sheriffs in town.

906
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,848
Acting all hard
when I'm not here.

907
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,935
Well, I'm here now.

908
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,961
Huh.

909
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,007
Are you the new boyfriend?

910
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,527
Can I talk to you
for a second, please?

911
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,970
All right, boyfriend.

912
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,451
All right.

913
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,204
My buddy's gonna handle this.

914
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,455
Okay?

915
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,324
That's real steel. You
don't mess with the Chang.

916
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,330
Listen, you gotta
leave her alone now.

917
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,495
I'm not even talking to you
like a police officer.

918
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,330
This is just me talking to
you like a regular guy.

919
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,844
So this is you without a badge?

920
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,775
Yeah. It's just
man-to-man.

921
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,764
Okay, let's backtrack a little bit.
So I'm a cop now...

922
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,362
You did it again. Yep.

923
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,368
You think you can
fuck with my business?

924
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,369
Are you threatening me?

925
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,931
I'm a cop, asshole.

926
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,605
You ain't shit.

927
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,207
What? You wanna jump?

928
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,125
Come on, bitch, let's go.

929
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,600
Let's do it.

930
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,445
Come on, let's go.

931
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,325
Jump.

932
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,047
You're not worth the paperwork.

933
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,244
I'm the law here.

934
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,726
Back off...

935
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,924
of everything.

936
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,163
Next time you come
to a call like this...

937
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,935
who knows?

938
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,889
Bullets fly.

939
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,725
Cops get hit all the time.

940
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,246
All right, so we're
just gonna come clean

941
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,407
and tell these guys everything.

942
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,961
Everything except for the fact that
we've been pretending to be cops.

943
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,406
What? No.

944
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,735
It's called
taking responsibility.

945
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,975
This shit has gone way too far.

946
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,126
It sounds stupid, man.

947
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,611
It's not stupid.
It is stupid.

948
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,330
It's smart. By
principle, it's stupid.

949
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,403
Justin, you could still stop right now.
Shut up.

950
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,128
Hi. Listen I don't know
where to begin...

951
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,691
I should probably do the
talking here... Shh.

952
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,042
I guess we want to
file a police report.

953
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,884
Mmm-hmm.
What kind of report?

954
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,415
Uh, he and I have been pretending to
be cops for the past couple of weeks.

955
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,601
Excuse me?

956
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,085
It sounds crazy.
Mmm-hmm.

957
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,730
Yeah. It started out
just as fun...

958
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,968
but now we're in a lot of
trouble and we need help.

959
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,121
From real cops.

960
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,924
Hold on a second there, Angie.

961
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,889
Don't believe
a word these guys say.

962
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,451
Oh, fuck.

963
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,163
These guys are a couple
of real jokers!

964
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,800
Let me guess.

965
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,207
You guys came down here to help
me fill out all that paperwork...

966
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,255
you ditched us with
the other night, am I right?

967
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,415
That's right, yeah.
No.

968
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,566
Good to see you guys again.
Come on back.

969
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,935
We're gonna go back.

970
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,255
This guy is a rascal.

971
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,850
No, I'm being serious.
We're really not cops.

972
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,246
That's not funny.

973
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,775
George Segars, he said
don't worry about it.

974
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,165
Help me. Please!

975
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,367
See you, Angie.

976
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,095
We're not cops.
It's not funny.

977
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,531
His name's
Mossi Kasic.

978
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,841
He's top of the shitlist.

979
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,047
I'm surprised you guys
haven't heard of him.

980
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,090
I deal with guys like this
on a daily basis, Segars.

981
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,561
I hear you, Sarge
but this guy is different.

982
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,291
He runs a crew,
preys on local shop owners...

983
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,646
and immigrants like himself.

984
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,606
He muscles in...

985
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,280
takes Co-ownership
of the businesses...

986
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,960
and then uses it for money
laundering and whatnot.

987
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,886
He's an animal.

988
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,206
<i>Hey, beautiful.</i>

989
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,841
<i>You can't reason
with him, can't talk to him.</i>

990
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,327
He loves to fight.
He lives for it.

991
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,369
He's got this crazy temper.

992
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,760
He can snap, just like that.

993
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,285
It's all right.

994
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,160
He's taken down
some big scores.

995
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,761
Everytime we raid his place, though...
nothing.

996
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,410
We can't find
anything on the inside.

997
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,841
I gotta say,
I want this guy bad.

998
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,651
It's good to hear.
I want him bad, too.

999
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,925
I think about it every night.
Me, too.

1000
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,605
I just lay awake,
staring at the ceiling...

1001
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,842
just thinking about
different ways to nail him.

1002
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,570
I'm obsessed with
nailing this dude.

1003
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,530
I wanna put him up on the wall,
you know, and just...

1004
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,967
"What's my name?"
That's right.

1005
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,804
Anyways, that's probably
never gonna happen.

1006
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,202
What's going on, guys?

1007
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,488
Nothing. We were just
talking about Mossi.

1008
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,215
Nobody in the community's
gonna testify against him...

1009
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,880
and without hard evidence,
we got nothing.

1010
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,730
So why don't we do surveillance?

1011
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,935
Believe me, I'd love to do that, but
it's a little bit above my pay grade.

1012
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,255
Right.

1013
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,645
However...

1014
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,967
between you and me, Sarge...
Everything is.

1015
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,202
This station has
a shitload of equipment.

1016
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,335
I'm talking about wiretaps,
pinhole cameras,

1017
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,203
anything you want,
I can get for you.

1018
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,535
I want all of it.

1019
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,815
All right.

1020
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,001
Let's do it. Yeah!

1021
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,040
Hey, Sarge, <i>Brothers in
Blue,</i> should we sing it?

1022
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,003
Sing what?
It's the academy song. Come on.

1023
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,804
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Fire it up.

1024
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,567
<i>Brothers in blue</i>

1025
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,410
That's good. This guy
never stops, does he?

1026
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,721
There's a police song?

1027
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,615
I gotta learn that.
You're a fucking idiot.

1028
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,335
We were supposed
to turn ourselves in

1029
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,488
and now your
checking out equipment?

1030
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,685
Dude, you heard the cop.
It's up to us to get this guy.

1031
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,171
He is the devil's nephew.

1032
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,606
We're not going near that guy!

1033
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,611
So let me get this straight.

1034
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,410
You finally meet
a girl that you like...

1035
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,285
and she likes you, and then
some douchebag comes around...

1036
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,370
and says that you
can't be with her...

1037
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,568
and your first
thought is to run away?

1038
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,410
Yes. He said
he would kill me.

1039
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,295
I'm not gonna let
you run away, man.

1040
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,855
You know what?

1041
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,927
What?

1042
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,655
You wanna know
what people say about you?

1043
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,808
I know what they say.

1044
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,730
But I haven't felt like
this in a long time.

1045
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,724
I'm good at this.

1046
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,447
I need you, man.
I need you to...

1047
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,323
I need you to
believe in me, man.

1048
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,930
Please.

1049
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,325
I'm in.

1050
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,495
Were you about to cry?

1051
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,681
Yeah, I don't
wanna talk about it.

1052
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,535
I got misty, my heart
started pumping fast.

1053
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,880
So how are we
gonna find this guy?

1054
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,531
This is it.

1055
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,842
God, I'm getting good
at this detective stuff.

1056
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,843
Is that why you're
wearing that suit?

1057
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,525
Oh, yeah, I got promoted.

1058
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,251
You promoted yourself again?

1059
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,611
Yeah. I'm a detective.

1060
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,720
What do you think
they're doing in there?

1061
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,161
I don't know, man. Something
shady, that's for sure.

1062
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,129
Let's see if we can get
inside and open those doors.

1063
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,495
Let's see if we don't do that.

1064
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,601
Listen, Chang...

1065
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,121
you've gotta stop
being such a pussy, okay?

1066
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,441
Yeah, no shit.

1067
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,815
Dude...

1068
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,080
I will whoop your little ass.

1069
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,486
You will not touch his ass.
I will hit him.

1070
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,970
Don't you fucking hit me.

1071
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,921
Don't!

1072
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,495
Oh, perfect.

1073
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,120
If I wasn't involved in a case
right now, I would light you up.

1074
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,325
That right there, that apartment,
that's our vantage point.

1075
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,244
But somebody lives in there.

1076
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,360
Justin, then they
better have good food...

1077
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:01,650
because they're about to be
involved in their first stakeout!

1078
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,415
No.

1079
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,848
Police business,
open up now.

1080
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,961
Hi.

1081
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,931
Hi.

1082
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,840
You are a fox, aren't you?

1083
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,325
Detective?

1084
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,925
Absolutely, that's my title.

1085
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,167
Dude.

1086
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,122
Uh, ma'am, we're gonna need to come inside
and talk to you for a minute, please.

1087
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,964
- Oh.
- All right.

1088
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,641
Oh, yeah.

1089
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,484
It smells like
a fish farted in here.

1090
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,090
Look at that bald one.
He looks super racist.

1091
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,208
Like he snores
the "N" word at night.

1092
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,560
I've seen every cop show ever.

1093
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,001
I'm so excited we're going
to be doing this together.

1094
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,446
Yeah.

1095
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,615
Just so we're clear, there's
no "we" in this situation.

1096
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,775
Don't be a dick.

1097
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,165
I can still be a part of
the team though, right?

1098
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,481
Absolutely.
No.

1099
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,855
Also, I'm not on ecstasy.

1100
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,095
No way.

1101
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,441
I've had some very
dramatic relationships.

1102
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,690
My therapist says I need
to meet a more stable guy.

1103
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,731
I love a man in uniform.

1104
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,530
You do?

1105
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,091
Sure.
I don't like this.

1106
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,920
I did a three-way once
with two paramedics.

1107
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,686
Ma'am, I'm going to need
you to go to your room.

1108
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,122
All right.
Alone.

1109
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,203
You do not know
what vibage is, pal.

1110
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,845
Why would you do that?

1111
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,287
I think she's an interesting lady and
she's got a lot to offer this team.

1112
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,761
We are doing surveillance.
We don't have time.

1113
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,161
Ow.

1114
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,208
All right,
we got action, people.

1115
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,328
Oh, good work, Joe.

1116
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,641
Who is that?

1117
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,484
I think he's the boss.

1118
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,801
Take photos of his henchmen.

1119
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,011
You got good ones?

1120
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,171
How fun is this?

1121
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,202
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I need some help.

1122
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,210
It's my bubble bath.

1123
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,170
It's not wet enough.

1124
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,855
No.

1125
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,360
Yes. That's our
civic duty.

1126
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,727
No, it's not. Focus.

1127
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,405
We would love to help you,
ma'am, but we can't...

1128
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,680
because we're on a case and
we take our job seriously.

1129
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,410
That is so hot.

1130
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,607
You're so hot.

1131
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,369
<i>Listen to me very carefully.</i>

1132
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,170
<i>I need you to lay low.</i>

1133
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,321
<i>Very low.</i>

1134
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,050
<i>For now.</i>

1135
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,083
The Dominicans are
going to make the delivery.

1136
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,887
And you're not going to do
shit with it until I say so.

1137
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,965
Understood?

1138
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,610
<i>You gonna keep
everything underground.</i>

1139
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,762
Underground?
What is he talking about?

1140
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,691
Deliver what?

1141
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,126
I don't know.

1142
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,171
What's this?

1143
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,080
This is the shipment.
This is our evidence.

1144
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,606
How do you know that?

1145
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,809
Because it's a cargo van,
and these are all bad guys.

1146
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,928
These guys are
terrible-looking people.

1147
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,250
Open it.

1148
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,203
Oh...
Shit.

1149
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,535
So?

1150
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,450
They tell me their badge
numbers don't match up.

1151
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,571
Which tells me one thing.
They're not LAPD.

1152
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,286
Oh, we're dead.

1153
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,121
So, what are they?

1154
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,001
Feds, ATF, maybe a special unit.

1155
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,841
What?

1156
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,328
Yeah, we're black ops, dude.

1157
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,251
So, you're going to be invisible
until I can figure it out.

1158
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,400
Just to be clear...

1159
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,045
if that little
guy wasn't here...

1160
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:47,046
some serious weird shit
would be going on right now.

1161
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,690
What kind of weird shit?

1162
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,135
You are an
acrobatic angel, aren't you?

1163
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,215
Ah.

1164
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,287
Joey, turn around.

1165
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,935
Oh!

1166
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,928
Okay.
There she goes.

1167
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,290
Boom, we got them.

1168
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,771
Now what's in those crates?

1169
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,241
I'm seeing it the same time you're
seeing it. How would I know that?

1170
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,641
I need to narrate it, because that's
what you do in these situations.

1171
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,643
You see something and one of
the guys says it out loud.

1172
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,724
And the other guy, you, is
supposed to go, "Yeah."

1173
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,287
Oh, shit, dude. We gotta
know what's inside those crates.

1174
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,090
So, what do we do now?

1175
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,361
Joey, watch the fort.

1176
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,567
Where are you going?

1177
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,051
Wait a minute, actually.

1178
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,535
Oh...

1179
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,163
That is so hot.

1180
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,441
There he is.

1181
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,570
This is a terrible idea.
Is it?

1182
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,815
Dude, are you kidding?

1183
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,841
No.

1184
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,175
He's a gang member.

1185
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,281
Exactly.

1186
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,601
Relax, I'm just
gonna go talk to him.

1187
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,444
I will not relax.
You're an idiot.

1188
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,924
I got this.

1189
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:04,921
Hello.

1190
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,521
You have the right to remain silent...

1191
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,761
Here we go.

1192
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,121
Justin, help me now!

1193
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,011
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

1194
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,969
You have the right
to an attorney.

1195
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,320
If you can't afford an attorney,
one will be appointed...

1196
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,204
He's biting my neck!
He's biting my neck!

1197
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,361
Ow!

1198
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,455
Can I talk
to you for a second?

1199
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,481
Sure.

1200
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,401
What the fuck!

1201
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,409
We've gotta find out
what's in those crates.

1202
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,760
Are you kidding me?
I'm not...

1203
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,161
No!

1204
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,961
Get in!

1205
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,405
Get in the car!

1206
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,001
Okay.

1207
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,605
So we're kidnapping people now?

1208
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,162
No, Justin, it's called
an interrogation.

1209
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,615
Where are we going
to interrogate him?

1210
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,162
He's just a friend.
He's just a friend.

1211
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,765
We gotta get the information out
of him about what's in those crates.

1212
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,524
He doesn't even
speak English, dude.

1213
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,721
Then we torture him.

1214
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,161
You're the mysterious one.
You have to be bad cop.

1215
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,367
So now I'm torturing him?

1216
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,244
Hey, who said anything
about torture, Your Honor?

1217
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,408
You just did 3 seconds ago.
Shut up, dude.

1218
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,164
This is
a serious moment.

1219
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,089
Make him talk.

1220
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,366
You can do it.
All right.

1221
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,615
You can do it!
Yeah, born ready!

1222
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:37,735
Listen to me,
you little dick-snatch...

1223
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,681
What was that?

1224
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,484
He spit in my face.
He's not afraid of me.

1225
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,883
You know what, then
make him afraid of you.

1226
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,283
<i>Reservoir Dogs,</i> dude.
Cut the ear.

1227
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,044
Be realistic for once.

1228
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,884
Lift up that side.
I'm trying.

1229
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,123
What's in those crates?
What's in those crates?

1230
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,566
This is not how you waterboard.

1231
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,961
Yes it is!
Have you seen <i>Zero Dark Thirty?</i>

1232
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,451
No, but I know
how to waterboard, though.

1233
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:10,801
Stop drinking it!

1234
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,805
What the hell, man?

1235
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,201
It's sad what you're trying to do.
It's embarrassing.

1236
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,089
All right.
I hate Mossi.

1237
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,766
Everybody does. I'll tell you
anything you want to know.

1238
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,041
Just stop this shit!

1239
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,531
Why didn't you say that before?

1240
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,045
And that you spoke English.

1241
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,170
You didn't ask. You guys
pulled me out of my truck.

1242
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,455
You drag me across
the fucking ground.

1243
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,527
That's on me.

1244
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,175
You throw me in
the back of a cop car.

1245
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,440
Point the guns in my face!

1246
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,888
Look, maybe we got off
on the wrong foot here.

1247
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,001
Yeah, maybe.

1248
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,207
You want a beer?

1249
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,124
Yeah, beer sounds good.

1250
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,327
What's your name?

1251
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,646
My name is Pupa.

1252
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,975
If we untie you, do you promise

1253
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,331
not to freak out and kill us?

1254
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,405
I promise not to freak out.

1255
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,170
Ah, man!

1256
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,005
For real, I don't know
what's in those crates.

1257
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,124
But Mossi paid some heavy
cash for whatever's in there.

1258
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,770
But how do we find out?

1259
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,566
Mossi's having one of his parties tonight.
I hear shit gets crazy.

1260
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,769
At least 3 people die,
everytime he has a party.

1261
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,849
What?
Those crates will be there...

1262
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,889
but if you wait until tomorrow
that shit's going to be gone.

1263
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,042
So we gotta do it tonight.
You gotta do it tonight.

1264
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,328
Shit, this game is gangster!

1265
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,970
Really? Gangster?

1266
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,646
It is, man, I tell you.
Where can I buy this thing?

1267
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,882
You see, Pupa,
it's kind of complicated.

1268
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,247
There's a lot that goes into
making games these days.

1269
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,441
Oh, Justin.

1270
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,131
A lot of politics. I'm
talking to a lot of people.

1271
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,607
It sounds like you bitched
out, is what it sounds like.

1272
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,888
You gotta go in there
and fight for your shit.

1273
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,326
Don't you believe in yourself?

1274
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,561
You gotta go in
there and tell them...

1275
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,485
"This is my game. We're
going to do it my way."

1276
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,041
"Put the game out there now,
for people to buy it."

1277
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,964
I gotta say, we have to
get into that party.

1278
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,963
We gotta get in
that party tonight.

1279
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,615
I don't understand
what you're saying.

1280
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,325
When you start getting excited,
your English escapes you...

1281
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,448
and you get really
native in your tongue.

1282
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,250
How do we get into that party?

1283
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,495
When I'm speaking English but it still
sounds like...

1284
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,885
Like that, I don't
what you're saying.

1285
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,280
You didn't get
any of that?

1286
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,015
<i>Qué?</i>

1287
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,166
You didn't get any...

1288
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,645
<i>Qué?</i>
Holy shit.

1289
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,121
What?
What?

1290
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,083
This is gonna sound
a little bit weird...

1291
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,208
But you two could
pass as brothers.

1292
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,970
Ew! No,
this guy's gross!

1293
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,081
No offense.

1294
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,851
No offense?
You just said, "Ew."

1295
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,164
The last person who said,
"Ew" to me, was my mother.

1296
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,415
Hmm.

1297
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,602
You guys know
where she is right now?

1298
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,728
Heaven?
You got it.

1299
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,001
Heaven.

1300
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,246
Hopefully from natural causes?

1301
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:39,689
If me getting angry and doing something
foolish is natural causes...

1302
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,001
then yes.

1303
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,615
You look handsome.
Thank you.

1304
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,041
A great-looking guy.
Now I'm here to play war.

1305
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,601
Hey, Chang.
How do I make you...

1306
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,527
look like him?

1307
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,401
Shit.

1308
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,681
How much time we got?

1309
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,127
Uh...
Shut up.

1310
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,927
I need a water, three bowls and a lemon
peel. Come on, people, let's go!

1311
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,127
That's my girl.

1312
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,726
She said she'd done a three-way
with a couple of paramedics.

1313
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,081
Mmm-hmm I think this
the marrying type.

1314
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,321
Sounds like it to me.

1315
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,642
All right.
Are you ready?

1316
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,165
We're ready.

1317
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,495
Oh, ho-ho.

1318
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,443
That's handsome.
Well...

1319
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,922
I look like someone hit me
in the face with Lil Wayne.

1320
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,721
Lil Wayne!

1321
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,650
He made a joke about Lil Wayne!

1322
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,331
Oh, shit! That's funny.

1323
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,682
Hey, Josie, I gotta say
you're one heck of an artist.

1324
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,602
- Thank you.
- You're fine, too, girl.

1325
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,921
Yeah, she's pretty.

1326
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,003
Josie, Josie,
look at me. Look at me.

1327
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,162
Don't do intense right now.
Okay.

1328
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,004
You're crazy fine,
that's all I'm saying.

1329
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,361
That's a compliment,
now let it go.

1330
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,641
Just gonna
say one more thing.

1331
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,450
I wouldn't, though,
is what I'm saying.

1332
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,204
I promise it's going to be okay.

1333
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,840
I mean, I would like
to take off your dress...

1334
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,255
and put my penis inside of you.

1335
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,487
I'd really like to
get all up in that shit.

1336
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,449
No, like in her vagina, though.

1337
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,250
I know, but you can't say that.
Appreciate it.

1338
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,615
I wouldn't put it in your butt.

1339
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,800
- I gotta go.
- And a good day to you, <i>madame.</i>

1340
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,720
Do you think I could put "Undercover sting
operation for the LAPD" on my resume?

1341
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,881
Absolutely.

1342
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,603
Did you see when I said
<i>"madame?"</i> That's French.

1343
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:13,761
That was sweet.

1344
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,446
Here you go, buddy.

1345
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,011
What if I start sweating, dude?

1346
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,655
These tattoos are
gonna run down my face.

1347
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:19,681
Then don't sweat.

1348
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,444
What do you mean, "Don't
sweat?" I'm not doing this.

1349
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,125
Why you got to be such a bitch?

1350
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,249
Pupa, don't call me a bitch.

1351
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,200
You made such a cool game. If you
make it, then you got to play it.

1352
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,646
I've been saying
that this whole time.

1353
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,889
You made such a cool game,  now you gotta play it.

1354
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,655
What are you doing
with your accent?

1355
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,250
What are you
doing with your voice?

1356
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,575
I was agreeing with you.

1357
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,726
But you have an accent.

1358
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,809
I know you are agreeing with me,
but you're saying it like I was.

1359
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:45,885
What I'm saying is, you made a
great game and I believe in you.

1360
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,361
So, now, you just gotta
play it.

1361
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,851
All right, dude.
Feel free to rob him.

1362
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,083
Oh, boy. He can't hear you. I'm just
going to ignore him from now on.

1363
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,335
How is this on me?

1364
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,249
This is insane.

1365
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,920
Listen, Justin,
no matter what happens...

1366
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,525
no matter what
anyone says to you,

1367
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,085
all you gotta say to them is...

1368
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,526
What does that mean?

1369
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,241
It means, "Suck my balls
and cock, you cocksucker."

1370
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,243
Yeah, just say that.
Okay.

1371
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,762
Good luck, homes. You're gonna need it.

1372
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:19,207
Look, I'm telling you,
we look a lot alike.

1373
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,328
But Mossi is probably gonna
recognize that you're not me...

1374
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,965
and then he gonna
cut your face off!

1375
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,770
All right. Is that...?

1376
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,160
What are you talking about?

1377
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,244
Whoo! I'm sorry.
It's not funny.

1378
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,050
Wait a second.
What?

1379
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,455
One extra
touch for you.

1380
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,641
Pretty good, right here.

1381
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,604
Oh God, no.

1382
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:37,921
Just trust him.
Put it in.

1383
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,362
You put this in your mouth.
Ow. Ryan!

1384
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,567
You'll need it.
You need it, man.

1385
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,335
Here they come.

1386
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,362
Ow. Ow. Aah!

1387
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,010
I'm going to die here.

1388
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:06,015
It smells like prison
and bad parenting.

1389
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,042
Oh! Oh!

1390
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,409
<i>Relax! You'll be in and out.</i>

1391
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,803
All we gotta do is find out what's
in those crates and you'll be done.

1392
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,689
We'll get footage of it,
and you're out.

1393
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,810
That's easy for you to say.
They are all staring at me.

1394
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,203
Then stare back at them.
You are a <i>cholo vato</i> killer!

1395
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,050
<i>Own that shit!</i>

1396
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,248
I suck balls and cock.

1397
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,564
Ah.

1398
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,046
<i>Coño.</i>

1399
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,921
That's what I thought. Ah,
dude, I think it's working!

1400
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,055
Hell yeah, Chang!
You tell them!

1401
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,400
<i>Nice! Okay, we're in!</i>

1402
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:58,966
<i>Dude, those chicks are hot.</i>

1403
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,929
Shut up, dude.
I'm freaking out.

1404
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:04,562
<i>Just relax. Be like everybody
else or you'll stand out.</i>

1405
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:07,641
<i>Good.</i>

1406
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,891
<i>Dude! What are you doing?</i>

1407
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,371
I'm doing my white girl dance.

1408
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:15,806
<i>Stop doing that shit!</i>

1409
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,329
There's got to be some sort
of back room or storage area.

1410
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,729
You've got some
balls coming in here.

1411
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,446
Come with me.

1412
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,045
Mossi's gonna
wanna speak to you.

1413
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,528
Been looking for you.
Okay.

1414
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,450
Shit, what do I do?

1415
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,443
<i>I don't know,
but don't be nervous.</i>

1416
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,120
<i>But don't fuck it up, either.</i>

1417
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,365
The fuck are you doing here?

1418
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,323
I best not be finding out
you lost one of my crates.

1419
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,761
<i>Make him say
what's in those crates!</i>

1420
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,441
Um...

1421
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,806
What exactly are we referring
to in those crates, Bro?

1422
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,207
Hit this shit.

1423
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:01,524
Nah, Bro. I'm already
super piped-out.

1424
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,331
I was like, this pipe,
that pipe, every pipe.

1425
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,006
You know what I'm saying?
You feel me? <i>Coño.</i>

1426
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,049
I didn't ask.

1427
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,368
<i>Just do it, dude.
He's testing you.</i>

1428
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,570
You just got cranked up, fool.

1429
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:38,203
Ryan, what did I just smoke?
What does "cranked up" mean?

1430
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,249
You just smoked
crystal meth, dude.

1431
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,443
Crystal meth?
<i>It's not going to affect you.</i>

1432
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,800
It's not going to affect me?
What are you talking about?

1433
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:48,444
<i>Right there! They have a basement!
You gotta go down there.</i>

1434
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,331
No way, dude. Frigging
twitching right now.

1435
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,575
<i>Do not puss out now!</i>

1436
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,647
I'm pussing out.

1437
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:54,841
Listen to me.

1438
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,843
You gotta go down there
and see what that was.

1439
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,295
You listen to me, all right?

1440
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,288
I'm having a heart
attack right here!

1441
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,886
<i>All right,
just open up that window.</i>

1442
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,015
Okay. Okay.

1443
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,485
Why'd you hit me in the face for?
It's me!

1444
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,000
Move! I've got an
awesome entrance.

1445
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,930
Fuck, yeah!

1446
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,081
That wasn't cool.

1447
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,920
What the fuck are you wearing?
Here's where we're at.

1448
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,535
I did some intel, and that's
their safehouse down there.

1449
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,215
As the leader in our situation,

1450
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,844
I'm gonna check that out first.

1451
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,407
You're gonna hang out in the
hallway and stand guard, okay?

1452
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,688
What? No, dude,
I'm on crystal meth!

1453
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,928
I know, it's awesome.
I'm very jealous of that.

1454
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,481
How fun is it? I've done it 11 times.
Eleven?

1455
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,291
And I smoked crack once.

1456
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,726
Let's go!
No, please.

1457
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,281
Don't leave me alone here.
Please, I'm itching.

1458
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,055
I've got this post-nasal
drip thing going.

1459
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,890
Don't do that!
You're gonna make me...

1460
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,526
Don't... Hey!
Think about something else.

1461
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,170
Think about apple pie.

1462
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:50,975
I've got to take my teeth out.

1463
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,001
I gotta take the hat off.

1464
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,165
I gotta take this thing off my ear.
Wig off.

1465
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:02,766
Okay, come on.

1466
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,927
What the hell are you doing?

1467
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,486
Oh, shit.
I can't stop twitching.

1468
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,330
Okay, just don't think about it.
It's a mind thing.

1469
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,481
Okay.

1470
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,405
Come on, J.

1471
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,690
I'm so scared.
Hold my hand.

1472
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,445
I'm not holding your hand.

1473
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,122
Dude, I think I'm
addicted to crystal meth.

1474
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,281
You just smoked it once.

1475
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,490
Oh, my God. I would suck
dick for this high.

1476
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,641
You've got to be kidding.

1477
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,255
I wouldn't, but what if I do?

1478
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,691
I don't want to suck dick.

1479
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,880
Because I know I'm
gonna get good at it.

1480
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,289
Oh!

1481
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,641
Shit!

1482
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,481
Look at all these lights!

1483
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:53,768
Not the lights. We're excited
about the guns, right?

1484
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,008
Right. Right.

1485
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,003
Holy shit.
Justin, it's the crates.

1486
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,321
Check it out.
Jackpot, dude.

1487
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,209
Jack-motherfucking-pot.

1488
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,445
See these tags?
Yeah, man.

1489
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:04,641
You know what these are?

1490
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,728
These were confiscated
by the police.

1491
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,927
Yeah.

1492
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,209
They were supposed to destroy this shit.
He stole all this.

1493
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,930
I feel real good right now.

1494
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,162
I want to build a porch.
We should build a porch!

1495
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,885
Right now! That'd be great.
Right.

1496
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,281
I don't even know if I'm good
at woodwork or anything...

1497
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,091
but I feel like I can do that.

1498
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,362
Mmm.
Dude, look at me.

1499
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,855
Hey! Hey!

1500
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,041
Hey, hey.

1501
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,295
You wanna go crazy, dude?

1502
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,321
No.

1503
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:30,646
Neither do I.

1504
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,530
Thank you. That makes
me feel like a leader.

1505
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,091
Holy shit.
You know what this is?

1506
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,681
Clothes.

1507
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,525
This is actual SWAT gear, man.

1508
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,809
Let's be real. We're never
gonna build a porch.

1509
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,450
We're just lying
to ourselves, man.

1510
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,523
I just want to die, dude.

1511
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,371
What the hell is going
on with you, man?

1512
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:50,769
Something's going on inside my heart.
It hurts.

1513
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,729
Let's go, meth head, now.
I'm sorry.

1514
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,281
Now!
I'm sorry, man.

1515
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,775
I feel so sad!

1516
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,926
Stop.

1517
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:04,881
Whoa.

1518
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,887
Look at how far this one goes.

1519
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,524
What are you doing?

1520
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,570
This is so white trash, I don't
even know what I'm saying.

1521
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,290
What is that sound?

1522
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,682
Our heroes rise from
the depths of Hades!

1523
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,161
Stop, dude. You're
getting so scary.

1524
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:30,086
Hey, man, where
are you going? Wait up.

1525
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,850
I got it. Mossi looks like
the original General Zod.

1526
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,126
Hey!
Aah!

1527
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,695
Hey.

1528
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,370
You and me, right now.

1529
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,329
Wait!
I'll rip your head off!

1530
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,807
Timeout, okay?

1531
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,366
Seriously, guys!

1532
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,121
Uh-huh.

1533
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,287
Who's next?

1534
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,965
Fuck.

1535
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,415
Check it out.
It's a jackpot.

1536
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:51,487
What?

1537
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,329
Look, with the guns...

1538
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:56,769
with the SWAT, and Mossi's boss,
I got all his guys pinned.

1539
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:00,083
I've got enough evidence to
put this guy away for years.

1540
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,242
That's great, man.
Remember that long tunnel?

1541
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:03,441
See where it leads?

1542
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,125
It leads to Georgie's.

1543
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,495
Oh.

1544
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,761
That's why he
wants Georgie's so bad.

1545
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:11,048
It's not about money laundering.
It's about having control...

1546
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,810
of both ends of the tunnel.

1547
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,564
Do you see?
Why?

1548
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,085
That's the right question.

1549
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:20,165
Do you remember Segars said that
every time that they raid Mossi...

1550
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,890
they come up with nothing.

1551
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,887
He's using the tunnel as an escape
route to get rid of all the stuff.

1552
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,805
I cracked the case, man.

1553
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:31,682
I'm getting so good
at this that it's scary.

1554
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,080
Where are you going with that?

1555
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,610
To the police station,
to turn it in.

1556
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,967
No, you're not.
We're mailing it in...

1557
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,849
anonymously like we said.

1558
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,684
Justin, come on.
This is my collar.

1559
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,285
No one can know this was us.

1560
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:44,606
What is wrong with you?

1561
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,091
I worked hard on this.

1562
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,655
Why are you
getting so pissed off?

1563
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,125
Because I almost died in there!

1564
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,765
All right.
Look at my face!

1565
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,771
I smoked crystal meth!

1566
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,564
That's not funny!
All right.

1567
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,975
And for what? So you could
have some self-worth for once?

1568
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,128
Where is this coming from, man?

1569
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,807
I didn't do this for my
self-worth or whatever!

1570
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,731
I did it to get a guy like
Mossi off the streets...

1571
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,055
and we're going to!

1572
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,844
Unlike you, who runs away...

1573
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,048
anytime anything
in your life gets tough!

1574
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,323
And maybe that's why
you're still nowhere.

1575
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,962
Oh, I'm still nowhere? Me?

1576
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,121
Yeah, you.

1577
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,282
You've been moping
around for 8 years!

1578
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:22,723
Complaining about, "Oh, life screwed me.
That's why I didn't go pro."

1579
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,610
Life did screw me.
That's why I didn't go pro.

1580
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,366
You jumped off
a roof at a pool party.

1581
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:28,931
That's how you injured yourself.

1582
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,286
Be careful of where
you're going right now.

1583
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,568
Life didn't screw you.
You screwed yourself.

1584
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,490
Take some
responsibility for once.

1585
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,335
Why don't you act
like a man for once,

1586
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,920
because you might
like the way it feels.

1587
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,771
You know what?
Everyone was right about you.

1588
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,281
About what?

1589
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,683
You're a loser.

1590
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,285
Be a man.

1591
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,848
All right, okay.
I'll show you what a man does.

1592
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,882
I'll show you what a man does!

1593
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,281
You got Mossi?

1594
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,441
I got him.

1595
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,081
Wow.

1596
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,850
In this envelope, I got
enough hard evidence...

1597
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,809
to put away Mossi Kasic
for a lot of years.

1598
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,650
Holy cow!

1599
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,167
You and Chang make
a great team, you know?

1600
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:24,321
Yeah.

1601
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:28,055
I gotta get this in the right
hands right away. Can you help?

1602
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,650
Detective Brolin.
You've heard of him.

1603
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,571
He's in charge of the Organized Crime
Division. He's gonna love this.

1604
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,255
Might as well go
straight to the top.

1605
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,645
Straight to the top.

1606
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:42,966
Let's do this.

1607
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,441
Mmm.
What's up, baby girl?

1608
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:49,169
Carl, park in my spot one more time
and I'm gonna punch you in the dick.

1609
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,482
Larry! Fuck you!

1610
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,682
Okay. Okay.

1611
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,125
Okay!

1612
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,521
All right!

1613
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,683
There he is.

1614
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,730
Detective Brolin.

1615
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,289
I would like you to meet
Sergeant O'Malley.

1616
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,210
O'Malley, this is
Detective Brolin.

1617
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:15,921
Pleasure.

1618
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,441
Yeah.

1619
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,361
Have a seat.

1620
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:25,091
Sergeant O'Malley says he's
got some hard evidence...

1621
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,241
on Mossi Kasic.

1622
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,682
Enough to take him
and his whole crew down.

1623
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,604
There's some things
in here I didn't put...

1624
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,800
It's okay.

1625
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,401
It's okay. I wanna take
a look at it anyway.

1626
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,175
Sergeant O'Malley has been
doing some surveillance...

1627
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,726
of Mossi and his crew
for quite awhile now.

1628
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,050
I think he's got some
good stuff in there, sir.

1629
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,964
He seems pretty
excited about it.

1630
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,205
Give us a minute alone.

1631
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,407
Yes, sir.

1632
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,846
Not you.

1633
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,845
Relax.

1634
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,486
Who are you?

1635
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,689
I asked a question.
Who are you?

1636
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,003
Before you do anything, I
already made copies of that.

1637
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,889
Do you have a family?

1638
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:19,651
Are your parents still alive?

1639
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,610
Yeah, my parents
are alive... No.

1640
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,483
I am running a routine
undercover investigation...

1641
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,688
to bring down Mossi Kasic...

1642
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,690
and you're interfering.

1643
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,046
That's not true.

1644
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:45,481
Oh, it's not true?
No.

1645
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,681
Well, whoever you are...

1646
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,967
I suggest you run,
very far away...

1647
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,168
and grow eyes in
the back of your head...

1648
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,442
because you're never gonna
know when it's coming.

1649
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,729
Do you know who I am?

1650
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,720
I'm the guy who's gonna...

1651
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,564
Take me down.

1652
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,090
You've been
watching too many movies.

1653
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:12,481
Yeah.

1654
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,969
But I'm still
gonna take you down.

1655
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,448
So I guess we'll see.

1656
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:20,441
I guess we'll see.

1657
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,280
Hey, O'Malley,
where are you going?

1658
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,602
I forgot something
in my car, Segars.

1659
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,001
Wow.

1660
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,680
This sucks shit.
This isn't cool.

1661
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,805
When I came up
with it, it was cool.

1662
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,365
Where are their superpowers?

1663
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,167
We can give the
firefighters superpowers.

1664
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:54,367
It's just...

1665
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,240
It's just what?

1666
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:59,091
It's just your
idea sucks shit, Todd.

1667
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:03,364
What was that? I said
your idea sucks shit.

1668
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:07,443
Justin, where are you? Call
me as soon as you get this.

1669
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:10,120
You know that mobster, the guy
we thought was Mossi's boss?

1670
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,281
He's a cop.

1671
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,243
And he's got all
of our evidence...

1672
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,044
which means Mossi
knows everything.

1673
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,281
Holy shit, dude!

1674
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,244
We're dead! Dead! Dead!

1675
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,455
Okay, no.

1676
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:20,891
Everything is gonna be fine.

1677
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,724
Nothing can trace back to us.

1678
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,375
His name is
Ryan O'Malley,

1679
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,006
and he currently
lives with this guy...

1680
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,565
Justin Miller.

1681
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:31,800
Okay, print everything out
and bring it to my office.

1682
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,368
Hold on a second.

1683
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,805
I found the problem.

1684
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,411
They're not even real cops.

1685
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,961
What do you mean
they're not real cops?

1686
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,326
<i>Just what I said!</i>

1687
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,960
We gotta take care
of this right away.

1688
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:49,927
Get it done!

1689
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:53,290
I want the word on the street, underground!
Anyone who gets them!

1690
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,442
You're not even supposed to be
in here, let alone talking.

1691
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,921
A bunch of
shirtless firefighters...

1692
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,646
spraying zombies
with their hoses?

1693
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:09,920
What kind of game you
trying to make, Bro?

1694
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,535
I'm gonna give you one second
to get the fuck out of here.

1695
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:16,575
You like that?

1696
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:17,726
This guy is crazy.

1697
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,524
Yeah, <i>ese.</i>

1698
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,408
Now, a few weeks ago...

1699
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:26,882
I pitched you a game
and you didn't listen.

1700
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,883
That really hurt my feelings.

1701
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,282
You were there.
So were you.

1702
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:34,095
Now, I'm going to
pitch my game again

1703
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:36,168
and you're going
to hear me out...

1704
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:40,086
or I'm going to beat the shit
out of everyone in this room.

1705
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,090
And I've fought women before.

1706
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:44,811
I didn't win...

1707
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,247
but I'm down to redeem myself.

1708
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:51,363
<i>What if we made
a game so visceral...</i>

1709
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,126
<i>that it made you feel like you
were in real life danger?</i>

1710
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:57,284
To feel like it's
about to go down?

1711
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,407
<i>Don't think of it as a game.</i>

1712
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,295
<i>Think of it as
a real life experience.</i>

1713
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:10,647
<i>You are a cop.</i>

1714
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:16,335
<i>My game is about
getting into situations</i>

1715
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,328
<i>you wouldn't be in
in your normal life.</i>

1716
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:21,566
Situations that are dangerous.

1717
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:22,960
Real.

1718
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,441
Where it felt like you
could actually get killed.

1719
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,241
Aah!

1720
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,411
Real violence isn't
like in the movies.

1721
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,165
There he is!

1722
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,050
Gunfire is terrifying.

1723
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,204
<i>Bullets are sick.</i>

1724
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,488
They blast and rip
through everything.

1725
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,848
But isn't that what
people want, right?

1726
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:37,840
To really feel what it's
like to be in the shit?

1727
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:49,527
That's what I'm
talking about, people.

1728
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:50,895
Excuse me.

1729
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:54,527
Justin, there is a police officer
in the lobby to see you.

1730
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,843
No, no. You can tell
Ryan to wait, please.

1731
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:03,762
Justin! Do not go home!
I'm coming to your work!

1732
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,325
We are in a lot of trouble...

1733
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:07,530
No, no, no.

1734
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,166
No, no, no!

1735
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,404
I can assure you that I will
make this thing more real...

1736
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,449
than anything you have
ever seen in your life.

1737
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:19,361
How are you gonna show us
this realistic violence, huh?

1738
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:21,771
Freeze!

1739
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,331
Nobody move!

1740
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,521
You!

1741
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,246
That's a presentation!

1742
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:53,720
Let's make this game!

1743
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,006
Aah!

1744
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,362
What the fuck have
you guys been doing, huh?

1745
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,880
Dude, where
the hell are you?

1746
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:04,367
<i>Are you having fun?</i>

1747
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:07,731
<i>Justin Miller.</i>

1748
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:11,043
<i>You wanna be a cop? Average
police response time...</i>

1749
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,201
<i>12 minutes.</i>

1750
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,921
<i>Average time it takes for a
man to bleed out, 7 minutes.</i>

1751
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,243
<i>You do the math.</i>
Ryan.

1752
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:19,415
Ryan!

1753
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,647
<i>Don't come, Justin!
Run! Run!</i>

1754
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,080
Ryan!

1755
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,321
Fuck!

1756
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:30,535
Officer Segars.

1757
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,483
Segars, it's Justin.
Who?

1758
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:34,210
It's Chang. I'm Chang.

1759
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,601
Chang? What the hell,
you piece of shit!

1760
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,975
I'm hearing all kinds of crazy things!
<i>I know, I know.</i>

1761
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,764
And what you heard is true.
We're not cops.

1762
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:44,049
It's true?
<i>But everything I'm about to tell you right now is real.</i>

1763
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,975
Mossi has got Ryan,
and he is gonna kill him.

1764
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,810
He's got him in an underground
tunnel beneath Tirana, Mossi's club.

1765
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,815
What underground tunnels
are you talking about?

1766
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:51,855
<i>It's their safehouse.</i>

1767
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,920
And there are cops involved.
They tried to shoot me.

1768
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:57,011
Hey, you better watch
what you're saying, Chang.

1769
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,521
Just come to Tirana, and
you'll see it for yourself.

1770
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:00,886
<i>Please!</i>

1771
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,724
Where are you right now?

1772
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:18,491
How are you doing, partner?

1773
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:20,521
Long time no see.

1774
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,241
Mmm.

1775
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,249
You have the vest on.

1776
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,731
That's not gonna help.

1777
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:30,248
You're gonna die today.
And so is your friend.

1778
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:33,485
So the best thing you can do
is just tell me everything.

1779
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,009
Who did you give
the evidence to?

1780
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,121
How many copies do you have?

1781
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,163
Your choice.

1782
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,609
You go quick and painless...

1783
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:47,240
or you're gonna endure
something that is...

1784
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:49,961
unspeakable.

1785
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:06,727
Hey.

1786
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:08,331
What are you doing down there?

1787
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,610
Josie, you gotta go, okay?

1788
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:13,081
Take Georgie and Lydia and
get out of here right now.

1789
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:15,769
What are you talking about?
Don't come...

1790
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:18,130
I'm not a cop, okay?

1791
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,455
Why do you keep Saying that?

1792
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:20,527
It's complicated.

1793
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:23,040
But what's most important
is that you leave right now.

1794
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,080
Then, if you're not a cop,
who the hell are you?

1795
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,522
No one you want to know.

1796
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:29,651
Now go.

1797
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,244
Sorry to bother you gentlemen.
I need to come in...

1798
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,890
and take a look around.

1799
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,764
Just don't hurt him.
This was my idea.

1800
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:10,160
Just let him be.

1801
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,367
I'm the only one...

1802
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,851
Hey.

1803
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,364
One of your pigs is upstairs.

1804
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,602
I thought you had
control of your cops.

1805
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:26,681
Uh...

1806
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:34,810
No, no, no, Mossi, listen.

1807
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,200
Mossi, listen to me.

1808
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,735
You think he's
gonna protect you?

1809
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,128
You think a guy like that is gonna
protect you? Think about this.

1810
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,524
I've got evidence
to put him away for years.

1811
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,015
You don't think he's gonna
cover his tracks with you?

1812
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,088
Huh? Think, Mossi!

1813
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,810
What is your backup plan?

1814
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:56,960
No, no.

1815
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,207
No. No, please.

1816
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:04,091
No, no, no, please.

1817
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,249
No, no, no!

1818
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:11,886
No!

1819
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:14,129
Shit!

1820
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:17,931
That's my backup plan.

1821
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:26,805
Ryan! Ryan!

1822
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:50,920
Where do these doors go?

1823
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:55,815
This is gonna be so much
easier if you just hold still.

1824
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,615
Hold still!

1825
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,486
Open. Open. Open.

1826
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:05,721
No!

1827
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,450
I'll shoot him!
I'll shoot him!

1828
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,161
I swear to God...

1829
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:13,321
Oh...

1830
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:15,771
I had your 6, dude.

1831
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,200
Drop your weapons!
Get down!

1832
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:29,883
What are you doing?
Saving your life!

1833
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:32,240
But don't get on top of me like this!
I don't like this!

1834
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,571
6-Adam-7. Shots fired.
Request all available units...

1835
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:39,722
Justin, get off!
What the hell was that?

1836
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:42,247
Help get these
off me, quick.

1837
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:43,930
Holy shit.

1838
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:46,531
You all right?
Yeah, are you okay?

1839
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:47,681
Yeah.

1840
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,723
Thank you for
saving us... Just shut up!

1841
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:50,961
We didn't mean
to screw you over.

1842
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:52,491
It was never our intention
to pull you into this.

1843
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:53,687
I don't care.

1844
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:56,361
Get upstairs and get outside!

1845
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,807
And take that thing off.
That's a uniform.

1846
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,765
You gotta earn it. You
understand that, "Sarge?"

1847
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:04,123
Now get the fuck out of here.

1848
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,764
6-Adam-7.
I need backup, now.

1849
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,729
What are you doing?

1850
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:21,044
I can't do this.

1851
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:23,682
He's outmanned, he's
outgunned, and it's my fault.

1852
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,411
You were right. I gotta take
responsibility for once.

1853
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:27,561
That's not what I meant.

1854
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:28,801
Wait!

1855
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,121
What, man?

1856
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:35,250
No more running away, right?

1857
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,089
Yeah.

1858
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:58,046
What the fuck?

1859
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,680
My bad.
Let's not use these.

1860
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,488
What are you doing?
Get the hell out of here!

1861
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:36,135
Go! Now!

1862
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,889
Here's what we gotta do. We gotta
pull the fire away from him.

1863
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,451
He's stuck, okay?
All right.

1864
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:48,762
On the count of three, we
gotta shoot like crazy, okay?

1865
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:49,921
Okay?
Okay.

1866
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,481
3,2,1.

1867
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,402
Segars!
They killed Segars, man!

1868
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:16,288
All right, we gotta find a door.
Look back here. Let's go.

1869
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:18,329
We gotta get
the fuck out of here.

1870
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:19,811
Shit, man.

1871
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:22,363
What are we gonna do?

1872
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:01,010
Being in the shit
isn't the shit.

1873
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:02,375
No, it's not the shit.

1874
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,486
Look, man,
I'm sorry about everything.

1875
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:19,802
Everything I said.
I didn't mean...

1876
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:23,282
Justin, we're brothers.

1877
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,446
Yeah. Yeah.

1878
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:29,361
Yeah, we're brothers...

1879
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:35,169
Get up, get up!

1880
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:37,371
Are you okay?

1881
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:40,415
Did I just get shot? No, it's just
the spray. You're okay. We gotta go.

1882
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:41,441
I just got shot!

1883
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,215
Like I haven't been shot before.
Come on!

1884
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:44,241
What?
Let's go.

1885
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,327
Before we die,
I just want to tell you...

1886
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,966
If you tell me you love me, I'm
gonna punch you in your face.

1887
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:55,175
But we're about to die!

1888
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,645
But you were about to say
that you loved me!

1889
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:59,087
Yeah.
Say something better.

1890
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:00,921
Fuck you.

1891
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,690
That's better.

1892
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:10,565
Ryan?

1893
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:14,326
Ryan? Ryan?

1894
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:38,527
Shit.

1895
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,564
Chang!

1896
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:47,801
Oh!

1897
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,490
Fuck, Chang!

1898
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:16,561
Are you okay?

1899
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,370
Beside the fact that you
shot me, I'm great, Chang.

1900
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:19,521
I'm sorry.

1901
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,887
Segars, those two with you?

1902
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,009
Yeah, we're good.

1903
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:34,406
Code 4.

1904
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,164
All teams, 10-12.

1905
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:54,124
<i>Really too late to call so</i>

1906
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:56,568
<i>We waited for</i>

1907
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:05,210
<i>Morning to wake you
That's all we got</i>

1908
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:15,727
<i>To know me as hardly golden</i>

1909
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:22,447
<i>Is to know me all wrong</i>

1910
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:24,650
<i>They were</i>

1911
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:31,255
<i>At every occasion I'll be</i>

1912
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:34,329
<i>Ready for a funeral</i>

1913
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,250
<i>At every occasion...</i>

1914
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:42,805
<i>Life can
get confusing...</i>

1915
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:46,525
<i>and you lose sight of the
person you wanted to be.</i>

1916
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:55,044
<i>The Los Angeles Police
Department is proud to announce...</i>

1917
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:58,283
<i>Mossi Kasic is no longer
a threat to this city.</i>

1918
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:01,125
<i>Fortunately, I did not have
to make this arrest alone.</i>

1919
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:04,966
<i>This was truly a team effort.</i>

1920
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:07,886
<i>All right, man.</i>

1921
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:10,486
I'm passing this
gauntlet on to you...

1922
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:13,135
so don't let these streets get
all messed up again, all right?

1923
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:15,128
I got this shit, Bro.

1924
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:19,208
<i>Sometimes, you have
to go through hell and back.</i>

1925
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:20,731
Or, we just blow shit up!

1926
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,724
<i>To see that the problems you
thought were so big in your life...</i>

1927
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:25,651
<i>weren't so big after all.</i>

1928
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:28,565
Or not. We could just do
what you want to do.

1929
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:29,721
Right.

1930
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:32,320
The 2 cops have to work together to
get out. I think it could be great.

1931
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:33,925
Are you writing this down?

1932
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:35,485
Give me that.
Write that down.

1933
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:37,400
<i>And that courage
you always wanted...</i>

1934
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:40,445
<i>you always had it. You just
needed to get in the game.</i>

1935
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:42,455
Hi.

1936
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,970
Sorry, we don't
serve liars here.

1937
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:45,880
Can I get you a cup of
bullshit for the road?

1938
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:51,170
Josie, I didn't come
here to win you back.

1939
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:54,725
Or go back to whatever
we were before.

1940
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:59,327
I just came here to tell
you that I am truly sorry.

1941
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:03,605
And this is what I should
have done from the get-go.

1942
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:07,088
Hi, I'm Justin.
Justin Miller.

1943
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:11,684
I'm a 30-year-old video game
designer and I have a roommate.

1944
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:15,005
Nice to meet you.

1945
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:23,001
I'm sorry.

1946
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:26,164
I'm Josie. It's nice
to meet you, too.

1947
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,724
<i>Officer Nicholas Thomas.</i>

1948
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:40,690
<i>Officer Ryan O'Malley.</i>

1949
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:55,322
<i>And with hard work...</i>

1950
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:57,847
<i>and a little help
from a friend...</i>

1951
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:00,447
you can become that guy you
have always wanted to be.

1952
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:05,289
Thank you.

1953
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:07,085
Yeah!

1954
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:35,000
Aren't you a little
out of your jurisdiction?

1955
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:37,970
I'm off-duty, civilian.
And get in.

1956
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:45,607
Easy, dude!

1957
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,086
What's Pupa doing here?

1958
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:53,005
He's my informant. Now that
I need ears on the street.

1959
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:55,447
I'm the ears and the eyes
on the street for him to know.

1960
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:57,375
<i>All units be advised.</i>

1961
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:59,641
<i>Possible 2-11 Sierra
in progress.</i>

1962
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:01,006
Awesome, a 2-11 Sierra.

1963
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:02,844
Okay, drop me off right here.

1964
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:05,766
Oh, why are you
being such a bitch?

1965
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,524
Pupa, stop calling me a bitch!

1966
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:09,170
Dispatch, we are in route.

1967
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:10,935
No, we are not in route.

1968
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,015
Yes, we are.

1969
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:13,120
No, we are not.
Yes, we are.

1970
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:14,321
Don't touch that!

1971
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,609
We're gonna arrest you!

1972
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:21,095
That is a Code 3, Chang!
We are back!

1973
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:22,121
Whoo!

1974
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:33,721
<i>Pizza boy, freeze!</i>

1975
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:35,928
<i>Put the pizzas down, now.</i>

1976
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:37,247
<i>Put the pizzas down!</i>

1977
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:39,050
<i>Put them down!</i>

1978
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:40,281
And the sodas!
<i>And the sodas, too!</i>

1979
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:41,481
<i>Yeah!</i>

1980
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:57,209
You need to test
drive it for what?

1981
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:58,601
For emissions, sir.

1982
01:38:58,760 --> 01:38:59,921
Now step outside.

1983
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:01,724
Hey, Chang, hop in.
This one's you, bud.

1984
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:03,086
Yeah!
Yeah!

1985
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:05,245
I love that car!

1986
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:09,175
How long is he gonna be?

1987
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,720
I don't know. A couple
of hours, I bet.

1988
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,606
Officers, thank you so much.

1989
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:16,167
No, thank you so much.

1990
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:20,607
<i>What is...?</i>

1991
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:29,087
Oh, shit!
Not again, man!

1992
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:37,202
Oh, shit, the cops!

1993
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,681
Go!
