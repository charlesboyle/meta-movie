1
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,127
Marcus Flavius Aquila.

2
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,546
Fourth Cohort of Gauls,
Second Legion.

3
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,714
Come to relieve the command.

4
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:38,467
Lutorius Drusillus Salinator,
acting senior officer.

5
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,845
Where's the garrison commander?

6
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,638
He left this morning, sir.

7
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,141
Couldn't wait to get away.

8
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:02,158
Duty roster and the
keys to the pay chest.

9
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,744
No paymaster?

10
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:05,912
We're too small a garrison.

11
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,955
Unfortunately, that job falls to you.

12
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,417
As you probably noticed,

13
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,794
we've had a little trouble with the latrines,

14
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,588
but we have someone working on it.

15
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,923
Unsuccessfully.

16
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,090
So far.

17
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,594
This your first command, sir?

18
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,803
It is.

19
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,681
What made you choose Britain?

20
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,685
You have family connections,
I believe.

21
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,855
No.

22
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,774
I've noticed the fort.

23
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,442
It's in a poor state of repair.

24
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,946
We'll need to do something about that.

25
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,658
Yes, sir.

26
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,503
Move, soldiers!
Move, move, move!

27
00:04:56,964 --> 00:05:01,217
Get in line, soldier!
You, fall in!

28
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,315
Our new commander,
Marcus Flavius Aquila.

29
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,923
Where's our newly...
minted commander?

30
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,259
Probably unpacking his rule book.

31
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:03,738
You mark my words.
Marcus Aquila is tainted.

32
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,032
Well, you know who his father was.

33
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,908
The man who lost
The Eagle of The Ninth.

34
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,785
Not to mention 5,000 men.

35
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,704
That was a little absentminded.

36
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,337
I heard he asked to be sent here.

37
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,714
To this shithole?

38
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,798
Yeah.

39
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,259
I'm telling you. I've marched
with the Eagles 23 years.

40
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,803
I know a bad omen when I see one.

41
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,889
The boy's a bad omen.

42
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,933
Mithras, lord of light,

43
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,854
please help me,
father of our fathers.

44
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,151
Help me lead my men well.

45
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,990
Do not let me dishonor my legion.

46
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,957
Please help me regain
my family's honor.

47
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,906
Dig it deep, boys!

48
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,869
Your lives depend
on these defenses!

49
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,413
Move those poles over there.

50
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,672
You must be accurate
with your striking!

51
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,550
Power, speed and accuracy!

52
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,276
Just been told the grain delivery
hasn't arrived.

53
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,736
I want you to send out
a patrol to investigate.

54
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:10,573
I wouldn't worry, sir.
One day late, it's nothing here.

55
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,408
Well, it is to me.

56
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:14,952
Send out the patrol.

57
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,453
Believe me, sir,
too dangerous.

58
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,456
We've had reports of a
Druid roaming the villages.

59
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,542
Right now, I would
not send out a patrol.

60
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,588
The men, they need to eat, too.

61
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,468
Patrol, forward march!

62
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,429
Left, right, left.

63
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,651
Wake Lutorius.
Yes, sir.

64
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,290
Did you hear that?
Sir?

65
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,009
I hope the patrol's all right.

66
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,851
Seems I may have
got you up for nothing.

67
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,061
What did you hear?

68
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,981
It's cattle, most likely.

69
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,027
There. That.

70
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:13,862
Did you hear it?

71
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,159
Damn the dark.

72
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,539
Should I call the men to arms?

73
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,624
If it's only cattle,
they won't thank you.

74
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,546
Better angry than dead.

75
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,383
Call them out.
But in silence.

76
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,720
Yes, sir.

77
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:41,890
Soldier, wake up.

78
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,485
Bloody helmets.

79
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,367
Come on, come on.
Move, move, move.

80
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,734
Hold the line!

81
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:22,449
Legion, hold your positions!
Hold your positions!

82
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,494
Bring me a torch!

83
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,040
Hold steady!

84
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,011
Hold your line!

85
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,017
Centurion,
hold the cohort!

86
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,154
It's coming out!

87
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,516
Sir.
Well done, sir.

88
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,101
Well done, sir.
Sir.

89
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,495
Light of the sun
be with you, brother.

90
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,293
Many more of us would
be lying there, sir.

91
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,467
Is there any sign of the patrol?

92
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:00,649
Sir!

93
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,498
I'm not leaving them to die.

94
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,042
Muster 50 of the reserves
and hold them at the gate.

95
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,295
Sir, let me lead them.

96
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,840
It was my decision
to send out the patrol.

97
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,133
It's my responsibility
to bring them back.

98
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,300
Muster the men.

99
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,689
Move it! Move it!

100
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,067
Prepare for battle.

101
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,338
Mithras,
lord of light,

102
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,884
father of our fathers, let me
not bring misfortune to my legion.

103
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,136
Mithras, lord of light,
father of our fathers,

104
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,681
accept whatever sacrifice that I may
not bring misfortune to my legion.

105
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:27,606
On my command,
we form testudo!

106
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:35,697
Ready! Open the gates!

107
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,409
Legion,
double time, march!

108
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:06,561
Testudo, form!

109
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,835
Move forward!
Move forward!

110
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,588
Move forward! Advance!

111
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:50,605
Defensive circle, forward!

112
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,524
Hold the circle!

113
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,239
Hold the circle!

114
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,118
Hold the circle!
Tighten the circle!

115
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,954
Hold the circle!

116
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,418
Here, cut the others free.

117
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,471
Hold the circle! Hold!

118
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,981
Close the circle!

119
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,715
Fall back!

120
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,843
Fall back! Run!

121
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,345
Charge!

122
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,226
Run! Run!

123
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,476
Father, where are you, Father?

124
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,430
Father?

125
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:34,269
Rest now.

126
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:35,770
Lie still.

127
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,439
Still.

128
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,401
Where am I?

129
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,280
You're still in Britain. Calleva.

130
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,115
Calleva?

131
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,993
Your fort surgeon had you transferred here.

132
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,788
200 leagues in a mule cart.

133
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,292
With your wound,
it's a wonder you didn't die.

134
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:03,339
I'm your uncle on
your father's side, Aquila.

135
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,427
No, these are not the
best circumstances

136
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,720
under which to meet,

137
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,930
but assume you're gonna live,

138
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,016
so we'll have plenty of time
to make your acquaintance.

139
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,644
Now, please lie still.

140
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,897
The patient must rest.

141
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,444
I hope the medicine he's gonna
give you does you some good.

142
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,739
It smells repellent.
Like one of his farts.

143
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,157
My men.

144
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,910
What happened to my men?

145
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,078
Your men were saved.

146
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,122
Thanks to your effort.

147
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,174
Rest now.

148
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,529
Marcus?

149
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,114
Marcus?

150
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,034
You have a visitor.

151
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,745
Lutorius.
Sir.

152
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,251
The men have been asking after you.

153
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,127
And how are they?

154
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:25,296
Anxious to know how
their commander fares.

155
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,262
You have some news for my nephew?

156
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,555
Yes. Sorry.

157
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,807
We have received word from Rome.

158
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,060
For holding the fort
under extreme duress,

159
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,770
the Fourth Cohort of Gauls

160
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,772
has been awarded the gilded laurel.

161
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:46,985
From today, their standard
will carry its first wreath.

162
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,740
Tell the men I could
not be more proud.

163
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,576
That's not all, sir.

164
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:59,664
They've awarded you a military armilla

165
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,541
for conspicuous gallantry.

166
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,588
And an honorable discharge

167
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,591
because of your wounds.

168
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:20,643
The citation reads,
"Honor and faithfulness. "

169
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,273
Honor and faithfulness.

170
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:29,736
May I be the first
to offer my congratulations?

171
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,953
It was good of you to come so far.

172
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,501
Sir.

173
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,798
Thank you, Lutorius.

174
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:07,857
Stephanos.

175
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:09,942
Leave him.

176
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:13,154
There's no medicine for that.

177
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,582
Run!

178
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,348
Ease him down.

179
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,017
Careful.

180
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,312
Gently.

181
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,069
Fun.

182
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:38,030
Go, little guy, go!

183
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,912
What was my father like?

184
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:48,082
Your father?

185
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,047
Your father was a perfect Roman,

186
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:56,883
and everything that that implies.

187
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:02,346
The man who lost The Eagle
was the perfect Roman?

188
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:05,391
How The Eagle was lost,
no one knows.

189
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:08,019
But if your father died defending it,

190
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,812
he died honorably.

191
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,190
That's what we tell ourselves.

192
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,150
But what if he didn't?
What?

193
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,861
What if he was a coward and ran?

194
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,959
And now a fight to the death!

195
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:01,322
It's a slave.

196
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,867
A gladiator and a slave's
never a fair contest. Never!

197
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,415
Come on.

198
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,293
Come on. Fight.

199
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,755
Fight!

200
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,516
There's bravery.

201
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,519
He's going to give himself his death.

202
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,530
Come on, fight.

203
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,705
Look at that.
Look at that.

204
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,167
Go! Come on,
come on, go!

205
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,004
Fight!

206
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:02,592
Fight.

207
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,261
Fight him!

208
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:06,971
Fight, slave.

209
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,890
Get up and fight.

210
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,895
Get up. Fight.

211
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:15,646
Come on.

212
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,665
Kill him!
Kill him!

213
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,219
Kill! Kill! Kill!

214
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,063
Kill him!

215
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:06,072
Life. Life!

216
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,158
Life!

217
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,160
Come on, let him live.

218
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,621
Come on, get your thumbs up!
Come on, you fools!

219
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:17,708
Life! All of you, life!
Let him live.

220
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,835
Get your thumbs up!
Get your thumbs up!

221
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:21,754
Life!

222
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,631
Come on, you fools!
Get your thumbs up!

223
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,593
Life!

224
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,606
Come on! Let him live!

225
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,576
Now, that I was not expecting.

226
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,748
Why did you save him?

227
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:23,399
Stephanos!

228
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,241
I decided Stephanos is too old
to serve two masters.

229
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,661
I bought you your
own body slave.

230
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:37,329
I don't need
my own slave.

231
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:38,789
Marcus.

232
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,167
I should have been consulted.

233
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,420
Yeah, well, you weren't.

234
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,839
Slave!

235
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,351
His name's Esca.

236
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:05,858
I've no use for you.

237
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,485
I had no wish to be bought.

238
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:08,736
You should have run.

239
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,989
My uncle wouldn't have stopped you.

240
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:13,365
You saved my life.

241
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:16,285
I have a debt of honor to you now.

242
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,661
Against your wish.

243
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,831
No man should ever beg for his life.

244
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,041
You didn't.

245
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:26,212
I did, on your behalf.
And I meant nothing by it.

246
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,927
I am a son of the Brigantes,

247
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,763
who never broke his word.

248
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,183
My father's dagger is my bond.

249
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,980
I hate everything you stand for.

250
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,440
Everything you are.

251
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,027
But you saved me.

252
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,781
And for that,
I must serve you.

253
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,331
Who searched this wound?

254
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,667
The surgeon at the fort.

255
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,794
Was he drunk?
I've never seen such a mess.

256
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,463
You must have been in constant pain.

257
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,715
Sent him 200 leagues in a mule cart.

258
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,050
Nearly killed him.

259
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:16,804
I'm gonna have to re-open it.
There's still metal in there.

260
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:21,642
Well, if it's got to be done,
let him do it, right?

261
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,395
It'll be over before you know it.

262
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:27,148
I have the best knives in the business.

263
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,824
Some wine.

264
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:53,257
Ready?
Ready.

265
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,306
You can go.

266
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,560
No! I'm gonna need the slave
to hold you down.

267
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,563
Can't
my uncle do it?

268
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,565
Me? No.

269
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:13,527
No, I've grown to hate the sight of blood.

270
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,614
Especially the blood of
someone I'm quite fond of.

271
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,825
Be strong.

272
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,748
Quickly now.
Hold him down.

273
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,169
Put your weight on him, slave!

274
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,880
Harder!

275
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,925
Take a deep breath.

276
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,219
When I say,
"Now," let it out.

277
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,639
Now!

278
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,281
Did I shame myself?

279
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,458
Thank you.

280
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:01,719
There he is.

281
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,557
Spear!

282
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:07,808
Now!

283
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:10,519
Cut him off! Cut him off!

284
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,641
As I remember it,
he seemed pretty fond of you.

285
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,520
Marcus.

286
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,609
May I present my nephew,
Marcus Flavius Aquila.

287
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,195
Claudius Marcellus,
my old friend,

288
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,031
and the esteemed Legate
of the Sixth Legion.

289
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,241
Your uncle's an old sparring partner.

290
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:12,373
Tribune Servius Placidus.
An indispensable member of my staff.

291
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:13,540
Pleasure.

292
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,753
Supper's ready.
Boiled eggs and fish.

293
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,340
Don't all rush at once.

294
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,262
If it was my choice,
I'd be a soldier all my life.

295
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,724
However, my father will
insist I go into politics.

296
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:34,645
Have we met before?
Your name sounds familiar.

297
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,355
I doubt it.

298
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,148
The Tribune's Club, in Rome?

299
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,236
No, I was only a Cohort Centurion.

300
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,238
Ah, right,
I remember now.

301
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,031
Flavius Aquila.

302
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:48,075
Your father marched with
the Eagles, too, did he not?

303
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,578
He commanded the
First Cohort of the Ninth.

304
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:55,040
Of course. The Ninth.

305
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:56,959
Every Roman
remembers the Ninth.

306
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,588
Talking of the Ninth,

307
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,007
there's been rumor
recently along the wall.

308
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,634
Rumors. Rumors!

309
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,054
Britain's full of nothing but rumors.

310
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,765
They say The Eagle's been seen

311
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:16,895
receiving divine honors in some
tribal temple in the far north.

312
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:20,149
An Eagle in the hands of the
Painted People. A potent weapon.

313
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,026
One has to wonder how
any Roman could let it go.

314
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:28,240
If this were to be true,
surely we should act.

315
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,534
Well, what would Rome say?

316
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,872
Eagle lost, honor lost.
Honor lost, all lost.

317
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,791
Rome would love to get The Eagle back,

318
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,501
but politics being politics,

319
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,963
no senator's gonna risk thousands
of lives on a tainted legion.

320
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,300
My hands are tied.

321
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:48,844
Not if
you sent one man.

322
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,472
North of the wall?

323
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,726
No Roman could survive up there.

324
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,436
Has anyone ever tried?

325
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,522
No, and that's the point, militarily.

326
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,233
To try would be to fail.
How do you know?

327
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:06,320
One man can hide where an army can't.

328
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,363
No one would even know he was there.

329
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,616
It's too risky.
Quite right.

330
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,660
The loss of the Ninth
was humiliating enough

331
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,496
without adding another pointless death.

332
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:20,667
Marcus.

333
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,053
Marcus.

334
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:35,432
You can't let the likes
of him do this to you.

335
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:39,978
He has no notion of how you
and I have lived our lives.

336
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,107
Ever since I can remember,

337
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:51,198
all I've ever wanted to be
was a soldier, like my father.

338
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:52,366
I know.

339
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:54,952
I can still see him now,

340
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,578
riding away for the last time.

341
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:59,248
I can still feel how proud I was.

342
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,087
My father,

343
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,298
Centurion of the First Cohort
of the Ninth Legion.

344
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:11,718
Can you imagine anything more magnificent

345
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,680
than to be a soldier and to serve Rome

346
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,348
with courage and faithfulness?

347
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,559
But you did, son.
For what?

348
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:20,686
For what?

349
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:24,898
An honorable discharge?

350
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,191
That is fate.

351
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,569
That's in the hands of the gods.

352
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,072
When I made Centurion,

353
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,952
they asked me where
I wanted to be posted.

354
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:39,079
I knew the answer before
they had even asked it.

355
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:41,623
Britain.
Britain.

356
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,959
This is where my father lost The Eagle.

357
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,003
This is where I was
gonna win so much glory

358
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:48,922
that no Roman would ever dare
bring up his name again.

359
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,508
What do I do now?
What do I do?

360
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:54,511
I sit and I listen to some
silk-ass politician's son

361
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:56,763
piss on our family's name!

362
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,894
I will not sit in some villa
for the rest of my days,

363
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,479
rotting and remembering.

364
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,693
If I can't win back my family's honor

365
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,194
by being a soldier,

366
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,324
then I'll do it by
finding the lost Eagle.

367
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:17,576
You can't.

368
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:21,371
No Roman can survive
north of the wall alone.

369
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,374
You can't.
Then I'll take Esca.

370
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,377
I can use his knowledge.
He speaks the language.

371
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:29,004
Esca?
Why not?

372
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:32,758
Because he's a Briton.

373
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:36,303
He may not be from
north of the wall,

374
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:38,180
but he's a Briton.

375
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,643
And he will slit your throat
the minute you're alone.

376
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,770
He wouldn't do that.
How do you know?

377
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:45,937
He gave me his word!

378
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:47,814
His word?

379
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,192
He's a slave!

380
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:55,238
He says what he says and he does
what he does because he has to.

381
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,326
Once you're beyond the territories...

382
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:01,953
If I'm wrong,

383
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:04,623
then I'll die.

384
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,168
And that's how it should be.

385
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:27,581
Where are you headed?

386
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:29,791
North.

387
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:37,549
Didn't they tell you this
is the end of the world?

388
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,302
Just open the gate, soldier.

389
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,895
See you in the afterlife, Roman.

390
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,167
Who did this?

391
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,587
Rogue warriors.

392
00:46:23,573 --> 00:46:24,823
You know, sometimes,

393
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:30,078
I dream that I'll find
my father alive up here.

394
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,790
That he survived in some hidden place.

395
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,377
Is that why you're here?

396
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,380
To find your father?

397
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,715
No.

398
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:44,759
We're here to find The Eagle.

399
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,763
How can a piece of metal
mean so much to you?

400
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,560
The Eagle is not a piece of metal.

401
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:55,812
The Eagle is Rome.

402
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,357
It's a symbol of our honor.

403
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,819
Every victory.
Every achievement.

404
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,993
Wherever The Eagle is,
we can say that Rome did that.

405
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:19,586
You wouldn't understand.

406
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,422
How could you?

407
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,096
My father was Cunoval,

408
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,892
bearer of the Blue War Shield
of the Brigantes.

409
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,603
Lord of 500 spears.

410
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,942
Seven years ago,
you took our lands

411
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:44,819
and we rose against you.

412
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,491
My father and two brothers died.

413
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,371
My mother, also.

414
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:58,792
My father killed her before
the legionaries broke through.

415
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:04,130
He knew what they would do to her.

416
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:10,470
She knelt in front of him
and he slit her throat.

417
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:16,977
Rome also did that.

418
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:47,841
The Highlands.

419
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:51,094
Which way?

420
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,345
It's up to you.

421
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:57,517
Five thousand men can
disappear in a single glen.

422
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:01,938
There are thousands of glens.

423
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:06,443
We could search for months
and still find nothing.

424
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,420
North.

425
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:31,551
Whoever we meet,
let me do the talking.

426
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:35,305
If they find out you're a Roman,
they'll kill you.

427
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,223
And me.

428
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:49,379
Don't look.

429
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:53,007
There's three rogue warriors
behind you across the river.

430
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,220
How many behind me?

431
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:05,979
I don't see anyone.

432
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:09,482
They're there.

433
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:16,072
Are you ready?

434
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,163
Next time,
don't hesitate.

435
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:27,954
Stay back.

436
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,396
He remembers seeing
the legion march north,

437
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,981
but they never came back this way.

438
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:57,608
He must know more than that.

439
00:53:57,693 --> 00:53:58,901
He says not.

440
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,571
Ask him again.
No.

441
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:46,491
What are you doing?
Stay back!

442
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:47,700
Enough!

443
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:52,121
Enough. No more games. No more lies.

444
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:54,040
Ask him where the legion went.

445
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:57,377
Ask him!

446
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:35,915
Come on.

447
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:06,612
Kill him!

448
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,073
Kill him.

449
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,160
Do it now!
Chin-strap scar.

450
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,454
Only a Roman helmet does that.

451
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,500
He's a legionary.

452
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:43,065
What's your name?

453
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:48,654
I'm called Guern.

454
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:54,952
My name is Lucius Caius Metellus.

455
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:58,080
First Cohort of the Ninth Legion.

456
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:16,098
How have you survived up here for so long?

457
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,685
My tribe is called the Selgovae.

458
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:22,313
They took me in,
made me one of their own.

459
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:27,068
I have a woman,
two sons.

460
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,654
My life is here now.

461
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,035
I don't trust him.

462
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:38,788
He's a deserter.

463
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,039
We don't know that.

464
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:42,375
He's still a Roman.

465
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:45,795
He was a Roman when he ran.

466
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:02,478
I don't know what your father's orders were,

467
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,607
but all I know

468
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,237
is that we had it coming.

469
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:15,074
Why did they have to come north?

470
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,577
There's nothing here worth taking.

471
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,583
Couldn't they have been satisfied
with what they had?

472
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,921
They always have to punish

473
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:31,632
and push on looking
for more conquests,

474
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:34,802
more territories,
more wars.

475
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,139
Just tell me what happened.

476
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:47,398
When the order came
for the Ninth to march north,

477
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:48,566
it was autumn.

478
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,194
The worst weather they'd had in years.

479
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,906
For weeks we marched.

480
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:58,242
No sign of them.

481
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:02,788
Suddenly they just
appeared out of the mist.

482
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,546
We could hear them, picking the men off
at the back, one by one.

483
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,510
Finally, we just stopped
trying to find open ground

484
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:17,970
and we turned and faced them.

485
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,480
Those last few days of the legion,

486
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,484
I've never been so frightened.

487
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:35,196
We fought back-to-back.

488
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:39,367
No sleep. Pissing where we stood.

489
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,247
They came at us like animals.

490
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,052
This is the killing ground.

491
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,143
All the northern tribes were here.

492
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:09,355
But the worst

493
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:12,858
were the Painted Warriors
of the Seal People.

494
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,947
They hacked the feet off the dead

495
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:20,699
so their souls couldn't
walk into the afterlife.

496
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:34,380
They used those stones as altars
to kill the officers.

497
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,388
They ripped their hearts out
while they were still alive.

498
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,769
We could hear them being sacrificed.

499
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:03,033
My father?

500
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:05,744
What happened to him?

501
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:09,915
The last time I saw your father,

502
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,460
he was surrounded by the warriors
of the Seal People.

503
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:20,259
Did he die fighting?

504
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,635
I don't know.

505
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,057
I ran before the end.

506
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:29,560
A lot of us did.

507
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:31,937
You coward.

508
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:33,564
No.

509
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:36,400
You weren't here.

510
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:40,488
You don't know what it was like.

511
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,451
Who has The Eagle?

512
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,704
They say the Seal People have it.

513
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:51,123
How do I find them?

514
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,792
He knows.

515
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:57,546
He's Brigantes.

516
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,466
They fought here.

517
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:16,232
You always knew that place existed,
didn't you?

518
01:02:17,025 --> 01:02:18,943
We've wasted weeks searching,

519
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:20,653
and all this time you
could have told me.

520
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,279
Your tribe was there.

521
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:24,573
And they butchered my father's men like dogs!

522
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,158
Your father came to kill!

523
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:29,328
He came to punish us

524
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,996
'cause we would not
bow to the name of Rome!

525
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,916
Yes, I'd heard of this place.

526
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:37,878
To me and to all my people,
it is the place of heroes.

527
01:02:37,963 --> 01:02:39,964
How dare you?
You're still my slave!

528
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:41,423
And you'd be dead in a ditch without me!

529
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:42,967
I saved your miserable life!

530
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:38,165
No! What's happening?

531
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:41,126
No! Esca?

532
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,963
Esca? Esca!

533
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:46,799
Esca!

534
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:45,727
Marcus
Flavius Aquila.

535
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:48,605
Marcus Flavius Aquila.

536
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:56,363
Marcus Flavius Aquila.

537
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:14,339
Esca,
what's happening?

538
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:17,426
You're my slave.

539
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:06,488
Kneel!

540
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:14,037
Get on your knees!

541
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:16,706
Do it!

542
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,462
When I get the chance,

543
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:08,091
I will kill you.

544
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:28,416
Marcus.

545
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:30,377
Marcus!

546
01:16:32,546 --> 01:16:33,630
It's time.

547
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:36,633
We have to do this now.

548
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:40,053
It's our only chance.
While they sleep.

549
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:45,517
I thought I'd lost you.

550
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:49,687
Quickly.

551
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:41,966
There's no time now.
Let's go.

552
01:18:48,015 --> 01:18:49,140
We have to go now.

553
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:45,863
Where'd you get my father's ring?

554
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:07,302
What did he say?

555
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:09,929
We have to go.

556
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:29,115
Esca?

557
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:07,403
Esca.

558
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:11,449
If he wakes them, we're dead.
And you know it.

559
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:13,159
He has no reason to protect us.

560
01:21:13,243 --> 01:21:14,327
Do you trust me?

561
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:18,331
He won't betray us.

562
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:25,398
Come on!
Come on, boy.

563
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:48,421
How many days to the wall?

564
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:50,965
If we ride hard, four,
maybe five.

565
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:53,718
They'll never catch us on foot.

566
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:55,970
Have you seen them run?

567
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:25,833
You're wounded.
Why didn't you say?

568
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:27,502
It's nothing.

569
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:29,170
It's your bad leg.
Sit down.

570
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:31,464
We don't have time.
Just sit down.

571
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:43,935
In the cave, the chief,

572
01:23:44,978 --> 01:23:46,020
what did he say?

573
01:23:47,898 --> 01:23:50,024
Come on, there's no time right now.

574
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:12,880
They're coming.

575
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:17,093
Half a day behind.
The wind always lies.

576
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:09,061
No fires. It's too risky.

577
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:19,530
I'm not eating that.

578
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,408
I'm not a savage.

579
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:25,536
Then die a Roman.

580
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:29,790
You've lost a lot of blood.

581
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:33,711
You need to keep your strength up.

582
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:37,840
Eat.

583
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:24,553
It's time to go.

584
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,599
They can take shortcuts
that the horses can't.

585
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:39,777
Come on.
Keep going. Come on!

586
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:43,572
Come on!

587
01:26:46,576 --> 01:26:47,576
No!

588
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:31,639
We need to stick to the river.

589
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:33,224
They'll double back soon enough.

590
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:50,759
Rest.

591
01:29:50,844 --> 01:29:51,886
We can't.

592
01:29:52,596 --> 01:29:53,596
You need to rest!

593
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:57,182
Marcus.

594
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:01,979
You need to rest.

595
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:10,487
Come on.

596
01:30:27,756 --> 01:30:29,006
I can't go on.

597
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:31,675
Yes, you can.
You just need to rest.

598
01:30:34,512 --> 01:30:36,055
Take The Eagle.

599
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:38,223
If you find horses,
come back.

600
01:30:40,727 --> 01:30:43,687
If not,
just keep south.

601
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:46,440
Make sure this gets back to Rome.

602
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:47,858
I'm not leaving you here.

603
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:51,737
Do not dishonor me.
Take it.

604
01:30:52,113 --> 01:30:53,656
I came this far with you.

605
01:30:54,866 --> 01:30:56,200
I won't leave you now.

606
01:30:58,244 --> 01:30:59,370
Esca,

607
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:01,455
I order you.

608
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:03,415
Take it.

609
01:31:06,211 --> 01:31:10,214
I swore an oath of honor
never to abandon you.

610
01:31:13,385 --> 01:31:14,802
If you want me to leave,

611
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:17,888
set me free.

612
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:21,767
Give me my freedom.

613
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:40,160
You're free.

614
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:46,834
You're free, my friend.

615
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:55,801
Take it.

616
01:31:55,885 --> 01:31:57,011
No.

617
01:32:04,019 --> 01:32:05,352
I will return.

618
01:35:52,664 --> 01:35:54,790
Legion, halt!

619
01:35:57,835 --> 01:35:59,419
Your father's legionaries.

620
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:01,922
You were wrong.

621
01:36:03,174 --> 01:36:04,549
The dead can live.

622
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:10,347
My shame would not allow me
to tell you this before,

623
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:13,600
but I watched your father die.

624
01:36:15,812 --> 01:36:19,356
Whatever anyone tells you,
he was not a coward.

625
01:36:20,858 --> 01:36:23,652
He stood his ground to the very end.

626
01:36:26,364 --> 01:36:27,489
I saw it.

627
01:36:28,866 --> 01:36:32,077
The last Roman to hold
The Eagle was your father.

628
01:36:35,373 --> 01:36:36,540
The order, sir.

629
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:41,878
You've honored my father's memory enough.

630
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:45,299
You don't have to do this.
No.

631
01:36:46,134 --> 01:36:47,968
When I ran from your father

632
01:36:51,723 --> 01:36:53,390
I ran from myself.

633
01:37:00,398 --> 01:37:01,440
Give the order, sir.

634
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:13,452
Prepare to defend The Eagle!

635
01:37:50,448 --> 01:37:51,448
Esca!

636
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:40,789
Out swords!

637
01:42:19,258 --> 01:42:23,261
Let us remember the men who fought
and died in the name of honor.

638
01:42:24,638 --> 01:42:27,098
Romans and Britons.

639
01:42:29,393 --> 01:42:30,852
My father and yours.

640
01:42:45,576 --> 01:42:46,826
Fathers,

641
01:42:49,038 --> 01:42:50,080
brothers,

642
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:53,249
sons,

643
01:42:56,587 --> 01:42:58,671
may peace and honor follow you.

644
01:42:59,673 --> 01:43:01,800
May you know no more strife.

645
01:43:03,594 --> 01:43:06,471
May your souls take flight and soar

646
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:10,433
with The Eagle of The Ninth.

647
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:43,776
For my father.

648
01:44:52,786 --> 01:44:54,370
My dear boy.

649
01:44:58,584 --> 01:45:01,336
I congratulate you.
Rome congratulates you.

650
01:45:02,171 --> 01:45:04,631
And your family's good name is restored.

651
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:09,719
The Senate will want to re-form the Ninth.

652
01:45:11,430 --> 01:45:14,516
Perhaps they can reward
you with its command.

653
01:45:17,102 --> 01:45:18,645
However did you do it?

654
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:20,980
With only a slave to help you.

655
01:45:21,065 --> 01:45:22,273
He's not a slave!

656
01:45:24,693 --> 01:45:27,403
And he knows more about honor
and freedom than you ever will.

657
01:45:39,416 --> 01:45:40,542
So what now?

658
01:45:42,962 --> 01:45:44,254
You decide.

659
01:45:56,463 --> 01:46:00,685
