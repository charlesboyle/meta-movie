1
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,239
Thank... Thank you.

2
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,639
Thanks very much.

3
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,359
And I know that
there's a lot of people

4
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,679
on the list to play tonight,
but I was wondering

5
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,639
if I could just add one more.

6
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,279
She's a friend of mine who,

7
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,559
like me, is a long way from home.

8
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,759
And if it's OK with you, I was
wondering if you'd like her

9
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,599
to come up here and
play one of her songs.

10
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,999
Is that OK? Yeah?

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,926
Gretta, would you
come up here, please?

12
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,968
Uh, just give me a moment.

13
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,479
I think it would be a good idea if you'd
come up and sing one of your songs.

14
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,239
It would be a really
fucking bad idea.

15
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,559
Oh, Gretta, come on,
this is New York.

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,839
- No.
- You want to hear it, right?

17
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,319
Yeah?

18
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,679
- Yeah?
- Yes!

19
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,039
Sing it!

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,719
You're gonna be amazing.

21
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,639
Um, hi.

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,199
Uh, so this is a new song,
so it might be kind of rough.

23
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,639
Um... It's for anyone who's
ever been alone in the city.

24
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,005
Thanks.

25
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,041
See?

26
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,080
Get up!

27
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,919
It's 7:00am. Good morning,
New York, and welcome to

28
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,599
the second hour of Potsy
and Andy in the Morning!

29
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,879
Hey, Potsy, did you, uh...
did you read about the dog?

30
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,559
- The Korean restaurant thing?
- Oh, I certainly did.

31
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,961
Did you hear about that, Katie?

32
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,679
Fresh prospects, let's hear it.
What do you got for me?

33
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,119
No, no! Who's next on
this delightful journey?

34
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,079
No, no, no, no, man. No!

35
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,599
No, you can't... No, you can't!

36
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,959
It's shit. It's shit!

37
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,719
Get fucking out of my car.

38
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,879
Give me anything, a song,
a hook, anything I can work with.

39
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,039
I'm not asking for much.

40
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,439
That's something. That's good.

41
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,959
Until you started to sing.

42
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,167
Fuck.

43
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,925
Shit.

44
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,199
Where's Mom?

45
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,359
Where's my daughter?

46
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,966
What do you mean?

47
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,170
Your mom has a deadline.
She asked me to watch you today.

48
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,966
Let's go.

49
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,719
So where do you want to go,
the Museum of Natural History?

50
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,759
You want to go to the park
and get ice cream or what?

51
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,731
Why would I want to do that?
I'm not ten.

52
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,766
What's that smell?

53
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,599
Oh, that's gasoline. I was filling
up the car with gasoline,

54
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,279
and then I spilled a
little on my pant leg.

55
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,170
That isn't alcohol.

56
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,079
I think I got a meeting here.

57
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,839
You want to wait here
or you want to come?

58
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,999
You think you have a meeting?
Do you or not?

59
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,004
Let's see.

60
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,199
See? This is fun, right?

61
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,759
When we came into this neighborhood
in '92, there was nobody here.

62
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,439
It was like a war zone.
Hookers, crack...

63
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,889
- Now it's totally gentrified.
- I know, Dad.

64
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,439
I've had the tour.

65
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,759
OK, we're gonna go
up here. Just be quiet.

66
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,919
There's more of a dynamic of...

67
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,359
I think it's a great way to
generate revenue for the company.

68
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,479
- Hi, um...
- Hey.

69
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,079
Was there bad traffic?

70
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,719
Uh, no, traffic was actually
pretty good. I was just passing by.

71
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,959
OK, well, we were just... we were...

72
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,159
closing up about this
audio commentary piece.

73
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,399
Yeah, shit idea.
It was a shit idea then.

74
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,759
Still a shit idea.
It didn't age well.

75
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,079
Oh yeah, we...
we appreciate your candor.

76
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,759
We had... We had a different
view of it here, though.

77
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,359
I mean, musicians, for the most part,
are pretty much monosyllabic teenagers

78
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,239
who really don't have that much to
say, and that's the good ones, right?

79
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,319
So what are we doing here?
The music industry is fine.

80
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,839
It's always gonna be fine.
We always have been fine.

81
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,799
Maybe the kids are right.
Maybe music should be free anyway.

82
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,359
That's an alarming thing to hear
the head of a record company say.

83
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,604
- What? The truth?
- Well, um...

84
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,959
- Hm. Thanks so much, Karen.
- Yeah, let me know.

85
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,879
Uh, let's... let's talk more.
I really appreciate you...

86
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,359
- Yeah, of course.
- ...coming by.

87
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,239
- Thanks, guys.
- Great meeting.

88
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,679
- Good to see you, Dan.
- I'm glad we got that figured out.

89
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,239
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

90
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,599
Bands doing audio commentary
on their own music

91
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,919
is so fucking lame,
Saul, and you know it.

92
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,399
Ten years ago, man,
you would've shit on that idea.

93
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,359
It's something. It's an idea.

94
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,599
It's something that helps keep
the lights on. It's something.

95
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,479
We need vision, not gimmicks.

96
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,079
- That's us.
- I've been following you, Mr. Mulligan.

97
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,879
Down a track on every long shot

98
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,999
you've been bringing in here
for the last five years,

99
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,042
and which one of them
has come in? Which one?

100
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,719
Dan. Dan!

101
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,044
See you later, brother Saul.

102
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,729
Dan!

103
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,479
We need to talk, man.

104
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,519
Come back here. Don't you
walk away from me, man.

105
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,599
You can't do this shit, man.
You can't pull this shit, dude.

106
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,839
You can't pull this shit!

107
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,239
You want to do... Don't do this here.

108
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,959
I'm gonna do it right fucking here.

109
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,959
- Let's do it, then.
- All right, let's do it!

110
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,199
- Because they know, they know.
- They know what?

111
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,119
These people know that they
are sitting behind those desks

112
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,319
because I started an
independent record label

113
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,679
above that bar, Saul.

114
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,759
And we changed the way that
things were gonna be done, man.

115
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,999
- Nurture and foster.
- Things change, times change.

116
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,641
People got to change with them, Dan.

117
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,279
It's not working. You got to go.

118
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,839
I don't have time for this shit, man.

119
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,759
I got my own shit
going on, all right?

120
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,439
I'm getting... I'm taking my
client list. I'm out of here, man.

121
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,119
I am fucking out of here.

122
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,879
What are you talking about?
They signed to us.

123
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,079
Don't bother her. Don't bother her.

124
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,439
It's not Jerry Maguire.

125
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,161
Dad, let's go.

126
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,959
I'm taking my art, then.
That's it, I'm taking the art.

127
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,359
It's my art. I paid for it.

128
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,119
I bought it. I picked it out.

129
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,929
- I got it.
- Get away from me. Get away.

130
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,799
- I got it, I got it.
- No, you don't. Let go.

131
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,239
Stop it! Leave it there.

132
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,959
I'm coming back for that.
That's mine.

133
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,119
All of that's mine. Come on, baby.

134
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,362
You want another one?

135
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,479
Um, I do, but I won't.

136
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,360
I mustn't. I can't.

137
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,399
How could he fire me when I
set the whole fucking thing up?

138
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,399
Did you?

139
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,759
Don't you know anything
about your father?

140
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,879
Yeah. I do.

141
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,719
- I know what Mom says.
- What does Mom say?

142
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,090
She says you're a pathetic loser.

143
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,439
She says that affectionately.

144
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,479
What about you? What do you think?

145
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,319
I don't really know you.

146
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,404
So...

147
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,679
You know, two years is a long
time in the life of a teenager.

148
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,880
- Where'd you learn to talk like that?
- My psychiatrist.

149
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,919
Psychiatrist. You have
a psychiatrist now?

150
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,599
I do. Mom thought it would be a
good idea. I was acting strange.

151
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,919
There's nothing strange
about you, all right?

152
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,519
You're 15 years old. You don't
need a fucking psychiatrist.

153
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,719
Believe me, I know.
I know you better than anybody.

154
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,799
Yeah, you sure do, Dad.

155
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,611
How old did you say I was?

156
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,759
Did I say you were 15?
I meant you were 14.

157
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,810
Did I say 15?

158
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,479
You got money to pay for these beers?

159
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,879
I don't... I... I'm a kid.
I don't have any money on me.

160
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,799
- What happened to your pocket money?
- I spent that on condoms.

161
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,239
I... What?

162
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,961
No, no, no, no, no.
Too much information.

163
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,205
- You ready?
- For what?

164
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,279
Ah!

165
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,719
That was fun, right? Don't smile.

166
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,519
- It was fun, Dad.
- Yeah. You had a good time.

167
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,651
We haven't ran like that since
you were little. That was good.

168
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,479
- This your daddy?
- Hey.

169
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,279
- I'm glad you're here.
- Look away.

170
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,286
I was just going to the car...

171
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,959
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

172
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,919
I'm sorry. My bad.

173
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,084
Have a great day.

174
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,970
I could've taken that guy,
just didn't want to make a scene.

175
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,399
Do me a favor, all right? Don't tell
your mom I lost my job today.

176
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,479
Listen to me...

177
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,079
Thanks for a really normal day, Dad.

178
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,130
What?

179
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,079
Shit.

180
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,839
Hello, everyone.

181
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,163
- Hi.
- Hi.

182
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,127
- How's work?
- Uh, fine.

183
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,970
You look hungry.

184
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,919
Her teachers are
really worried about her.

185
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,759
No girls like her at school.
She is distant, and basically,

186
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,839
the only people who want
to hang out with her

187
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,759
are older boys who want to fuck her.

188
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,839
Oh, really? And you find
that a big surprise

189
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,879
seeing how you let... you let
her walk out of the house

190
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,719
looking like... I... like...
Jodie Foster from Taxi Driver?

191
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,439
She dresses the way she wants to,

192
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,559
and besides, any daughter
who dresses like that

193
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,479
- only wants one thing.
- A pimp?

194
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,999
- No, Dan, think about it.
- A daddy.

195
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,639
That is fucking bullshit.

196
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,839
She needs some guidance,
for fuck's sake.

197
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,759
Well, guide her! Guide her!

198
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,239
You waltz in here
like a fucking clown,

199
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,479
you tell me how to raise my kid,

200
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,999
the kid that you pick up
once a month and decide

201
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,759
you have a fucking conscience about.
You know what?

202
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,879
Thirty seconds after you're gone,

203
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,204
we'll have totally forgotten
you were ever here.

204
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,610
Thank you.

205
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,726
Shit.

206
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,526
Fuck.

207
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,839
I thought there was no hope.

208
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,839
I thought there were no answers,

209
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,079
and then I found God.

210
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,399
God may not always be on our time,

211
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,879
but he's on time.

212
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,204
Whenever you're alone... Sir?

213
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,079
Go.

214
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,199
Have a talk with God.

215
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,044
Right, man. OK.

216
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,999
I'm gonna have a little
talk with God, all right.

217
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,559
Thank you. Thank you.

218
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,406
What if he doesn't answer?

219
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,079
Attention, due to a
signal malfunction

220
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,559
at Jay Street,
the next uptown train...

221
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,959
- Fuck.
- ...will arrive in 20 minutes.

222
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,759
Hey. Give me a bourbon. Hurry up.

223
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,130
- What kind of bourbon you want?
- Well, I don't care.

224
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,119
...and I was wondering

225
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,999
if it might be OK if she came
up here and sang a song.

226
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,799
Is that OK? Yeah?

227
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,601
Gretta, would you
come up here, please?

228
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,199
Hi.

229
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,002
So, this is a new song, so it
might be kind of rough. Um...

230
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,079
It's for anyone who's ever
been alone in the city.

231
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,165
Thanks.

232
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,239
- I'm in.
- What?

233
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,359
I want to make records with you.

234
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,839
I want to... I want to produce you.

235
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,359
I want to sign you.
We're meant to work together.

236
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,439
Sorry, didn't you see what
just happened up there?

237
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,879
Yeah, what? Are you
feeling sorry for yourself?

238
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,959
No, I like my music. Who cares
if they don't get it, right?

239
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,399
You just need to work on
your performance a bit.

240
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,759
I'm not a performer, I write
songs from time to time.

241
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,399
Are all the songs as
good as that one?

242
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,319
Are you really an A&R man?
You look more like a homeless man.

243
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,399
I've been celebrating all weekend,
I signed a band and we got carried away.

244
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,879
That's some song you got there.
I promise you it could be a big hit.

245
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,359
Plus, you're beautiful.

246
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,399
Sorry, what's beauty
got to do with anything?

247
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,519
- Jesus, you're tricky, aren't you?
- No, I actually just think

248
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,479
that music is about ears, not eyes.

249
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,319
And I'm not Judy Garland
just off a Greyhound bus

250
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,803
looking for stardom,
but really, thank you.

251
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,971
- OK, bye.
- Bye.

252
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,039
OK, here's the truth.

253
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,199
I couldn't have signed you
if I wanted to, all right?

254
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,759
OK.

255
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,359
I didn't come from a signing tonight.
I haven't signed anybody in seven years.

256
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,479
My label's completely
lost all faith in me.

257
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,319
So why did you give me your card?

258
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,399
Force of habit. If I look homeless,
it's because I practically am.

259
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,319
I left my home about
a year or so ago.

260
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,079
I'm sleeping on a shitty mattress
in some shitty apartment,

261
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,119
and I wasn't celebrating tonight.

262
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,639
I was drinking my ass off
standing on a subway platform

263
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,999
ready to kill myself,
and then I heard your song.

264
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,119
- Want to get a beer?
- Sure.

265
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,090
OK, come on.

266
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,919
"Dan Mulligan. Born 1966.

267
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,919
Headed A&R department at
Island Records for two years.

268
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,839
Left to cofound indie
label Distressed Records

269
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,759
with Harvard classmate Saul Byron."
So you own Distressed Records?

270
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,559
I sold all my interests due
to emotional difficulties.

271
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:30,279
- What emotional difficulties?
- I was too emotional. Read on.

272
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,959
"Very active on the hip-hop scene
in New York in the early '90s,

273
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,759
the pair were responsible
for discovering

274
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,359
numerous breakthrough artists.
Won two Grammys as producer.

275
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,519
Lives in New York
with wife, music journalist,

276
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,002
Miriam Hart, and their daughter."

277
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,279
- What happened to the Grammys?
- I pawned them.

278
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,239
You pawned them?
How much did you get for them?

279
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,559
125 for the both of them,
which got me nice and wasted

280
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,759
- one weekend a couple months ago.
- Were you drunk when you heard my song?

281
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,319
Absolutely, that's when
the magic happens.

282
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,999
- What magic?
- I hear things.

283
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,959
- You hear things?
- Arrangements.

284
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,759
You need to be drunk
for that sort of thing.

285
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,559
You must've been drunk tonight,
because nobody else heard anything.

286
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,759
No, your song's good. It's you.

287
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,199
Standing up there like a tomboy.
I don't mean to be offensive,

288
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,719
but don't you think that
look's a little passé?

289
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,519
- Really?
- Seriously.

290
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,999
We get you a look and a killer video,

291
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,319
and you'll go straight to the top.

292
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,679
I'm thinking Norah Jones,
singer-songwriter thing at a piano.

293
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,639
Or the... or The Cardigans,
back in the day, when they...

294
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,959
when they first came to America?
Maybe even Deborah Harry.

295
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,159
A male band behind you.
What? You find that amusing?

296
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,079
No, I'm sorry, something
went down the wrong way.

297
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,759
Sorry? No, you were saying?
Me with a cardigan on? Norah Jones?

298
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,479
Babe, who the fuck
do you think you are?

299
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,359
You're gonna stand up on a
stage with a beat-up guitar

300
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,279
and you think you're
Carole fucking King?

301
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,519
No, I just think that an A&R man

302
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,159
telling an artist how they should dress
or come across is total bullshit.

303
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,239
People don't want that.
They want authenticity.

304
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,719
OK, babe. Authenticity.

305
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:11,160
Give me the name of one artist that
you think passes your authenticity test.

306
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,599
- Dylan.
- Dylan!

307
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,159
That is the most cultivated artist
you could've thought of.

308
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,639
His hair, his sunglasses.
He changes his look every decade.

309
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,399
Randy Newman.

310
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,079
I fucking love Randy Newman.
OK? You got me on that.

311
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,479
Listen to me.

312
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,479
I am not saying that you can't be

313
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,559
a real bona fide motherfucker
in this business,

314
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,919
but you got to do whatever it takes
and get people in to see your shows,

315
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,244
where the music can
start to do its real work.

316
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,479
Oh, my God. What are
we even talking about?

317
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,799
You can't sign me, and I
don't want to be signed.

318
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,199
That's right! What's not to like?

319
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,799
Come on, let's get out of here.

320
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,041
Ah, shit. You're gonna have
to get these beers, though.

321
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,799
OK, so, uh...

322
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,799
- It was really nice to meet you.
- Oh. Where are you going?

323
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,159
To sleep. I have a plane
to catch tomorrow.

324
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,759
Where?

325
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,079
- Home.
- Why?

326
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,279
Because I'm sick of this city,
and I want to go back to Uni.

327
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,879
Oh, come on. Come on, no one
comes to New York and just leaves

328
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,568
without something terrible happening.
What? What happened to you?

329
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,999
Hey.

330
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,769
Come on, you can... you can share
with me. I'm no stranger to misery.

331
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,519
Listen, just come to my label

332
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,479
and let me play your
demo to my partner.

333
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,879
If it doesn't work out, I will
personally pay to change your ticket.

334
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,239
What's one more day in New York,
for crying out loud?

335
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,719
You're just probably gonna go
home and mope around anyway.

336
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,679
All right, look, I'm gonna
go home and think about it,

337
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,210
and I'll call you either
way tomorrow. OK?

338
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,879
- Good answer.
- Yeah.

339
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,239
- It was very nice to meet you.
- Yes, pleasure.

340
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,239
Pleasure's mine. Hey, you...
you got my number, right?

341
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,880
Yeah.

342
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,599
- Hi! Dave?
- Yes.

343
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,839
Hi. I'm Jill. I work in
hospitality at the label.

344
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,119
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

345
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,759
- Hello. I'm Gretta.
- Nice to meet you.

346
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,039
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

347
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,879
Right this way. Thank you, Marco.

348
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,919
I think you're really
gonna like the apartment.

349
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,599
- It's very high-end.
- Sorry, ladies.

350
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,959
Hey, I... I'm sorry. Are you, um...
You're Dave Kohl.

351
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,319
- Yes. Yeah.
- Yeah, I told you guys.

352
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,279
We just, um... we saw your film the
other day. I so love your songs in it.

353
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,719
Thank you very, very much.
This is Gretta, my girlfriend.

354
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,639
- She writes songs, too.
- Oh, cool.

355
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,919
Oh, would you mind taking a photograph.
That'd be so awesome.

356
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,129
Just that button right there. Yeah.

357
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,279
- Yeah, it's a good one.
- Thank you!

358
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,479
- All right, thank you.
- Thank you so much, you guys.

359
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,159
You're gonna have
to get used to that.

360
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,159
This movie is selling
out all over town.

361
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,359
- It's crazy.
- Unbelievable.

362
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,761
Oh, no, it's real.

363
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,999
All right, here we are.
We hope you like.

364
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,399
So, uh, your fridge in
here is stocked with food.

365
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,759
There are two sets of keys
on the table in there.

366
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,759
This is your driver's number and my cell
phone number. I'll leave that here.

367
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,279
You're due at the label
later this afternoon

368
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,279
to meet everyone and say hi,

369
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,959
then we'll take a tour
around the studio.

370
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,359
So, probably want to catch up
on your sleep before then.

371
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,519
So I'll leave you to it, OK?

372
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,241
- Pleased to meet you, Gretta.
- Nice to meet you, too. Thanks.

373
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,079
This place is a shit hole.

374
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,249
Biggest fridge I've ever seen.

375
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,279
Oh my God! Come here.

376
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,439
Hey, can...

377
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,079
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

378
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,439
Should I have come over in,
like, a week or two

379
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,679
and let you settle in first
and get used to everything?

380
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,679
- No.
- Are you sure?

381
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,607
Yeah. I don't know if I could do
this without you. It's kind of scary.

382
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,807
- Am I a wimp for saying that?
- Eh...

383
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,519
Hey! There he is. Big Dave.

384
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,639
What's up, kid?
How you doing, brother?

385
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,319
- Good to see you. Gretta?
- Nice to meet you.

386
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,479
Come on in, guys.

387
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,919
- Put Dave at the head of the table.
- All right, I like it.

388
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,839
- You guys, you meet everyone?
- Hi, everybody.

389
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,439
My assistant, Mim,
the beautiful Mim. This is, uh...

390
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,279
- ...Mildred from marketing.
- Hi.

391
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,439
Billy there is social media.

392
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,999
The rest of the gang
you'll meet, spend time with.

393
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,919
So, uh, Gretta, you're gonna play guitar
on a track or two, I hope, right?

394
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,879
Oh, yeah, sure.
I mean, if Dave wants.

395
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,679
Yeah, Gretta and I have been writing
together for a couple years now,

396
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,079
even before the film came along.

397
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,879
So I would love for us to
try a couple of her songs.

398
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,559
Did you... did you write
on the film with him?

399
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,719
- No. No, no, no. No, I...
- No?

400
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,119
I mean, that's the sound we're
after is from the movie, right?

401
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,279
- Of course.
- Oui?

402
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,919
- Yes, yes.
- Si? Capice?

403
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,159
Yes, I just, you know... Gretta's
very much a part of the inspiration

404
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,479
behind everything, you know,
so I just thought...

405
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,159
She's not just my girlfriend.
We're partners almost.

406
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,959
- I just wanted to include her.
- Um, just to be completely clear,

407
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,479
I'm... I'm just tagging
along on this.

408
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,799
I'm really happy to be here
and more than happy

409
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,399
to accompany Dave
on a couple of tracks.

410
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,119
How sweet is this girl? I love that.

411
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,602
Whew.

412
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,170
How great are these guys?
I love them.

413
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,126
Rolling Stone.

414
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,039
Yeah, thank you so much.

415
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,319
All right, it was great
talking to you. Thanks.

416
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,479
What's that?

417
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,399
- That's matcha tea.
- Matcha tea?

418
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,839
Yeah. It's got, like,
four million antioxidants in it.

419
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,959
- Oh my God, it tastes like piss.
- I like it.

420
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,999
Samurais used to drink it
before they went into battle.

421
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,919
You're not a samurai;
you're a songwriter.

422
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,319
- Well, I'm kind of like a samurai.
- Are you?

423
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,839
- OK, bring it back to the start.
- Let me give these to the guys.

424
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,719
Oh, hey. We got to go to
LA for a week on Monday.

425
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,879
- We're going to LA?
- Uh, no, sorry.

426
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,159
It's just with some label guys.
They have an office there.

427
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,039
They want me to meet
this video director guy.

428
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,919
But in the meantime, I'd really
like you to listen to this. So yes?

429
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,679
Yes, I'm sorry. I'll, uh...
deliver coffee.

430
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,286
OK.

431
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,959
- Hey, guys, can we do this again?
- You got it, Dave. Take two.

432
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,959
And rolling.

433
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,685
Thank you.

434
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,719
Oh my God!

435
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,159
- Hello!
- Look at you!

436
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,279
Oh my God!

437
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,439
He has the studio for three months,
and then we go on tour,

438
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,199
- so I think we're staying for six?
- This is unbelievable.

439
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,239
You're total rock stars.

440
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,959
Which studio is he working with?

441
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,679
- Electric Lady.
- Oh, fuck off.

442
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,199
- I know.
- Oh my...

443
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,599
- Cool, isn't it?
- Are you serious?

444
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,359
- So, uh, this is me.
- Aw, it's lovely.

445
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,519
It's like that old joke. You put the key
in the door, you break a window.

446
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,279
My God, look at all this stuff.

447
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,319
Yeah, a lot of the studios,
uh, are upgrading.

448
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,679
So they're practically giving stuff away.
I can record an album here soon.

449
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,605
Well, that'd be cool.

450
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,359
Look at you. You've got CDs.

451
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,999
Yeah, I just phased out all
my cassettes. Have a sit down.

452
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,719
- It's very retro of you.
- I have whiskey or water.

453
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,119
- Whiskey, please.
- Of course you will.

454
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,439
Look what you've got.

455
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,479
People are going crazy for that here.

456
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,319
When I play a show, and the people
know I went to college in Bristol,

457
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,239
the first thing they ask is
if I know your boyfriend.

458
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,119
Tell me about it. I'm becoming
"Dave Kohl's girlfriend" back home.

459
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,679
I'm like, "Hello, we used to
be a team. What happened?"

460
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,639
Ah, you know what they say,
get your songs in a movie.

461
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,599
So this is me. This is where I've
been for God knows how long.

462
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,199
- I love it. Yeah.
- Do you?

463
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,159
Did you see the bed? I made that bed.

464
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,039
That's impressive.
How do you get up there?

465
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,439
I vault. I vault.

466
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,719
You vault? With a pole?

467
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,799
No, no pole. It's just, it's one...

468
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,279
I do it in one straight,
like, one straight luge.

469
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,959
Unless I'm drunk, in which...
in which case I...

470
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,279
it's often a dismount.

471
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,719
- God.
- It's the back I like.

472
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,839
It's like he's holding a guitar,

473
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,519
but he wants you to
think it's his penis.

474
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,079
He's saying, "Look,
it's a guitar, but it's not.

475
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,084
This is the actual size of my penis."

476
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,839
Why, no?

477
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,039
I am gonna shoot this
because you have to play that

478
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,199
the way you just played it.

479
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,399
OK, you play the guitar, 'cause I
can't do that when that thing's on.

480
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,439
I will. OK, where's...

481
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,119
- It's in G.
- I know G.

482
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,559
- I don't like that.
- I can play G.

483
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,239
It doesn't matter,
you have to get over this.

484
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,239
- This is an exercise.
- Yes. Ready?

485
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,006
Slower.

486
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,201
Done.

487
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,199
- What do you think?
- What do I think?

488
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,199
I think...

489
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,839
I think I'm angry. I think I...

490
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,599
I think I'm mad at you
'cause it's so good

491
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,999
that I hate you a little bit.

492
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,559
So incredibly good.

493
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,159
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

494
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,119
- Really?
- Yeah, what's it called?

495
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,479
I don't know. Um, "Lost Stars"?

496
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,359
- You like it?
- I... I don't like it.

497
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,959
I think it's... I love it,

498
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,319
and I think it's
incredible, and is it...

499
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,239
Is it about... It's about me? It's not
about your other boyfriend, right?

500
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,559
I don't know if it's about you,
but it's definitely for you.

501
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,399
- I'll take it.
- It's your Christmas present

502
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,639
'cause I can't afford to buy you
another one. Happy Christmas!

503
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,119
This is the only present I want.

504
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,279
- Yeah? Happy Christmas.
- Thank you very much.

505
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,399
- I love you.
- I love you.

506
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,849
Aah! Turn it off, turn it off,
turn it off, turn it off.

507
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,206
Hi.

508
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,007
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

509
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,199
- What... what did you do?
- Uh, nothing, really.

510
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,239
I just kind of hung around here.

511
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,399
I went to some botanical gardens.

512
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,079
- Oh, really?
- It was very lovely.

513
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,919
- Nice.
- Yeah, it was good.

514
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,159
I wrote a new song.

515
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,559
- Did you?
- Yeah.

516
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,079
I was inspired in LA.

517
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,679
- Want to hear it?
- Wow, yeah.

518
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,119
- Would you be interested in that?
- I'd be very interested in that.

519
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,522
- I've got it right here.
- How exciting.

520
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,686
Fuck!

521
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,845
What the fuck is wrong with you?

522
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,529
You're like a fucking mind reader.

523
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,725
Who is it for?

524
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,399
Mim.

525
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,119
Mim from the label, Mim?

526
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,519
Mim...

527
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,559
Mim, who we met...

528
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,962
one month ago? Mim, Mim?

529
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,881
Yeah.

530
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,529
Was she in LA with you?

531
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,849
Yeah. Yeah.

532
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,043
I don't know what to say.

533
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,641
It just happened. I...

534
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,999
Maybe it'll go away.
Maybe it'll fade.

535
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,687
I just... I have to see it through.

536
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,119
Do you want to put your
head this end or this end?

537
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,648
Obviously...

538
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,285
Do you want a tea?

539
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,161
I don't remember if
you take sugar or...

540
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,759
I'm gonna wing it. I'll wing it.

541
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,919
Please, won't you come
out with me tonight?

542
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,199
I'm gonna play some songs
down at this open mic night.

543
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,959
- Why don't you come with me?
- 'Cause I hate your fucking songs.

544
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,199
All right, I think we both know
that that isn't true, so...

545
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,919
Sorry, I didn't... No.
I... I love your songs.

546
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,479
I'm just... I...

547
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,479
I'm being fucking horrendous right now,
which is exactly why I need to, um...

548
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,839
I need to go home.

549
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,799
That's exactly why you
need to come with me.

550
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,759
Come on. I insist.

551
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,839
- Uh...
- Pick that up and come with me.

552
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,319
You're coming.
I'm not leaving you here.

553
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,724
I'll come back, I'll find your fucking
head in the oven. Come with me.

554
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,959
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
I have a friend here tonight.

555
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,519
And if it's OK with you,
I was wondering

556
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,119
if you'd like her to come up
here and play one of her songs.

557
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,559
- Yeah!
- Is... is that OK?

558
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,884
Yeah? Gretta, would you
come up here, please?

559
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,759
- Hello?
- Hey.

560
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,639
Were you serious last
night about signing me?

561
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,201
Who is this?

562
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,361
Really?

563
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,483
I'm joking. Yeah, I was serious.

564
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,479
I have all my suits here.

565
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,879
Would you get me a nice suit
and make me look nice, princess?

566
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,159
- Wait, you can't just...
- I heard a song last night,

567
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,279
and I'm telling you,
it's exactly what that

568
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,719
- shit-ass label needs.
- I'm glad.

569
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,239
You can't just barge in here.
You can't come in like this.

570
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,119
- Why?
- Uh, because that's our arrangement.

571
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,039
- You got somebody here?
- That's not the point.

572
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,319
We have an arrangement.

573
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,999
- Hello!
- Stop it, will you?

574
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,679
- Stray man! Any stray man!
- It's not funny.

575
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,559
Don't worry about me, it's just
the husband taking a shower.

576
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,839
- You can continue fucking my wife!
- Hey.

577
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,079
- That's not funny.
- Hey, I'm sorry.

578
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,439
If I did, you'd be
the first I'd tell.

579
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,199
- OK?
- Oh, so you're not.

580
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,679
- I'll get you a shirt and a...
- No razor!

581
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,084
Stop it. All right?

582
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,079
You want to come in?
You want sexy time?

583
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,164
No.

584
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,959
OK, ready?

585
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,559
So where are we going, Mr. A&R Man?

586
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,919
We're going to my partner to play
him your music. Got your demo?

587
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,839
No.

588
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,959
- You don't have a demo?
- No.

589
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,919
Do you have MySpace
or Facebook or anything?

590
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,479
MySpace? No, I...
No, I don't. I just...

591
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,959
I... You know, I told you,
I write songs from time to time.

592
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,079
- What do you write them for?
- What do you mean, "what for"?

593
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,119
For my pleasure and for my cat.

594
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,239
Oh really? Does he like them?

595
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,799
She. Yes, she seems to.

596
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,559
- How do you know?
- Because she purrs.

597
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,199
Maybe she's booing.

598
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,639
No, she purrs at Leonard Cohen,
too, and she has very good taste.

599
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,639
- Maybe she's fucking with you.
- Can we stop talking about cats now?

600
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,559
- OK.
- OK.

601
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,359
Fuck it. Let's do this
the old-fashioned way.

602
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,239
Thank you, Gretta. Thanks very much.
Thanks for coming in.

603
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,199
I'm just gonna take a moment
to talk with Dan for a minute.

604
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,045
Thank you.

605
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,599
I'm not into it,
it's a little undercooked for me.

606
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,159
She seems to have kind of
an attitude problem and...

607
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,279
What are you looking for, man?

608
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,919
What, you want some...
some little teenage pop star

609
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,879
whose mom's been raising her
since two years old for stardom?

610
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,719
- I mean...
- No, that's not what I'm looking for,

611
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,759
but if you know someone
like that, I mean...

612
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,599
Just give me the money to make
the demo. I'll take her into the studio.

613
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,039
Get a hot-shit producer. Get a couple
session musicians, dial the thing out.

614
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,479
Then you can hear what I'm hearing,
and then you can tell me to fuck myself.

615
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,559
People send us their demos.
It's not the other way around.

616
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,359
We don't... we don't make demos.

617
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,639
We're prospectors, man,
we're investors.

618
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,199
We're digging for gold.

619
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,730
Make a tape, and we'll
get back to you.

620
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,644
That's the best I can
do right now, bro.

621
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,719
So I've been thinking.

622
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,964
Why do we even need
to rent a fucking studio?

623
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:03,919
Because... you need a desk,
a live room and soundproofing.

624
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,599
Laptop, Pro Tools,
a couple dynamic mics,

625
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,079
- and the city is our fucking live room.
- You mean record outside?

626
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,479
- That's right.
- Like where?

627
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,919
Everywhere.

628
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,086
Fuck him. We don't need a demo.
Let's... let's record an album.

629
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,239
Every song we do in
a different location.

630
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,039
All over New York City.
And we do it through the summer,

631
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,359
and it becomes this tribute
to this beautiful,

632
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,599
goddamn crazy, fractured
mess of a city, New York.

633
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,679
OK, like, under the bridge
on the Lower East Side.

634
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,199
Top of the Empire State Building.

635
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,679
Rowing boats in the
lake in Central Park.

636
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,599
Chinatown. Cathedral
of Saint John the Divine.

637
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,559
OK, in the subway, in fucking
Harlem, everywhere, OK?

638
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,759
OK, so what happens
if it starts raining?

639
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,679
Whatever happens, we record it.

640
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,519
- If we get arrested?
- Keep rolling. It'll be beautiful.

641
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,490
You like it?

642
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,319
What do you think? It's good.

643
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,159
- It's good. Come on.
- Will you produce it?

644
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,359
- Me?
- Yeah.

645
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,039
No, I haven't produced
in a long time.

646
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,239
We'll get somebody
young to produce it.

647
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,519
- No, but I want you to do it.
- Why?

648
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,729
Because I do.

649
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,639
I'll give you strings,
but we definitely need piano.

650
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,079
Fill in the guitars underneath.

651
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,039
- Got it. I love it. Done.
- Done.

652
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,489
The world's first Jag
mobile recording studio...

653
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,411
is done.

654
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,319
- It's bloody genius, it is.
- Where do you want to go?

655
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:27,039
We need musicians. Terminally,
miserably bored musicians.

656
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,399
And after that, I think, then you
bring in the violin and cello.

657
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,079
First cello, then violin.

658
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,439
When we get into that guitar thing,

659
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,599
I want it to just become a
whole different kind of song.

660
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,199
This is Malcolm.
Malcolm is a child prodigy.

661
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,079
He's been playing violin
since he was five years old.

662
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,239
I technically started
when I was four.

663
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,479
Four.

664
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,039
- Wow.
- And this is his older sister, Rachel.

665
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,039
She's at the Manhattan School
of Music on a full scholarship.

666
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,839
- Top-of-her-class cellist.
- That's amazing.

667
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:06,359
So here's the deal. I can't
afford to pay you up front,

668
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,959
so I want to offer you a...
a legitimate back-end deal.

669
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,599
Sound good?

670
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,999
Yeah, as long as it's
not fucking Vivaldi.

671
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,359
It's not fucking Vivaldi.

672
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,959
It's great. No, no, no.
I'm not... It's great.

673
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,599
We definitely need piano.
Like, fill in the guitar underneath.

674
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,526
- Major seventh...
- Got it. I love it.

675
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,766
Steve, beautiful.

676
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,279
- Zach, what's going on?
- I quit.

677
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,439
- Good luck, girls.
- Bye!

678
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,719
Keep in touch, yeah?

679
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,159
When we get into that guitar thing,

680
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,639
I want it to just become a
whole different kind of song.

681
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,479
I want it to be punk meets...

682
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,167
pop. And have some fun.

683
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,983
Ah, he's home.

684
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,479
Dano, what's up, man?

685
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,719
Troublegum, my brother.
My troubles are over.

686
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,519
- What say you give me some love?
- This is it, gangsta paradise.

687
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,919
- Right?
- I'm glad to see you.

688
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,239
Thanks to you, thanks to you.

689
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,799
Come give me a hug.
I don't know you, but...

690
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,439
That's Gretta.
Great singer and songwriter.

691
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,039
- Let's get another one.
- Another one?

692
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,359
Where have you been?
It's been two or three years.

693
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,319
- I don't appreciate this shit.
- Been on the down low a little bit.

694
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,359
- Doing this, doing that.
- Waiting for the next move.

695
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,161
Anticipating the next groove.

696
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,159
I know you got a lot of
shit to prove. Right?

697
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,759
Been on the underground,
looking for that new sound.

698
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,039
We ain't fucking around.

699
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,839
Yeah, 'cause if it ain't
right, then it's wrong.

700
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,439
And the road is long,

701
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,970
and you're only as strong
as your next move.

702
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,799
- You feel that?
- Good, man.

703
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,359
- That's pretty much it.
- Damn, that was like some...

704
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,079
paranormal activity type
shit moving through me.

705
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,759
- You know me.
- I'm just so happy to see you.

706
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,039
So nice.

707
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,399
Fat Jimmy, did you get that down?

708
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,079
- Yeah, I got it.
- 'Cause that was exceptionally good.

709
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,679
Hold my hand, baby, come on.
Now, how can I help you, brother?

710
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,039
An outdoor album?

711
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,599
- That's right.
- That's fucking crazy.

712
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,879
I wish I could've thought of that.
What do you want me to do?

713
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,079
I need musicians. I need a
bass player and a drummer.

714
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,768
- I got plenty of musicians.
- The problem is we can't pay them.

715
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,359
Fuck it, I'll pay them.

716
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,239
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

717
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,719
For him, of course.

718
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,039
- Now, come on...
- No.

719
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,079
- Get your sexy self in the pool.
- Come on.

720
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,959
No. Don't you touch me.
I will kill you. I will.

721
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,399
She's English.
She's a little uptight.

722
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,529
Yeah...

723
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,599
- Good luck on the album, Gretta.
- Thank you.

724
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,279
Everything you see around
here, this crib, these cars,

725
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,599
they're all because of him,
and I don't ever forget that.

726
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,679
- I get it.
- No, no, no, no, no.

727
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,479
You can't know.

728
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,239
A guy like that falls on his
lip for a couple of years,

729
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,239
people lose sight of who he is,
and they don't treat him

730
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,479
with the respect he deserves.

731
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,399
Hey, don't listen to anything
he's saying. It's bullshit.

732
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,759
- Come on.
- Yeah.

733
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,279
- Thanks.
- All right.

734
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,479
- Bye.
- Bye.

735
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,479
- Anything you need, OK?
- I love you, man. Thank you.

736
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,041
I like her.

737
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,479
Are you serious?
Are you listening to this? Really?

738
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,919
We're gonna use it!
It's gonna be genius.

739
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,039
- You're a genius.
- You're not listening to this.

740
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,439
You don't hear what I hear.

741
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,319
You're gonna make this
amazing, beautiful.

742
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,768
- I love it.
- Got it?

743
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,199
Those kids are gonna
be all over this track.

744
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,170
- Come here.
- Just so you know.

745
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,521
Take that.

746
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,607
Little children,
yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

747
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,999
Let me see this for a second.

748
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,679
Listen, I'm shooting
a song down here,

749
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,359
I need you to be quiet
for five minutes.

750
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,999
- No, thanks.
- I'll... I'll pay you.

751
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,359
- How much?
- A buck each.

752
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:27,079
- You're funny. Five dollars.
- Five bucks for all of you guys.

753
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,479
OK, hey, OK, two bucks,
two bucks each.

754
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,799
- No.
- No way.

755
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,239
All right, all right,
all right, five bucks each.

756
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,719
We're gonna do this for five bucks

757
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,279
and five lollipops,
one for each of us.

758
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,439
Throw in a box of
cigarettes and a lighter.

759
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,279
I'll give you one cigarette
for each of you to smoke

760
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,519
and you share it, and a
pack of matches, all right?

761
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,839
- Yes.
- All right. Can you sing?

762
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,919
Yes! Yes, that was it.

763
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,890
Yes, it's gonna work!

764
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,879
Oh my God, is that the Empire State?

765
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,599
Yeah, right here.

766
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,239
- Yeah?
- Set up here.

767
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,639
- Get that.
- It's really good.

768
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,319
- Yeah, it's great.
- The Wind's good, right?

769
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,239
It's not too loud.
It's good, it's good,

770
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,599
I think it's good.

771
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,319
And we can look into people's
windows, which is always fun.

772
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,999
You want to come
with me to get Violet?

773
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,359
- Is that OK?
- Yeah, come on.

774
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,279
- Cool.
- My brother, there you go.

775
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,879
Thank you very much.

776
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,007
There she is. That's her.

777
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,199
This is Gretta. She's the songwriter
I was telling you about.

778
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,807
- Hello. How you doing?
- My daughter, Violet.

779
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,239
So who was the cute guy?
The one in the blue shirt.

780
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,479
- Greg. You noticed him?
- Sure. I mean, who wouldn't?

781
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,759
- He's gorgeous.
- He's totally out of our league.

782
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,359
He's out of your league?

783
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,161
Well, I mean, he didn't
look out of your league.

784
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,931
Ignore him.

785
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,039
How do you get someone to notice you're
ignoring them if they're ignoring you?

786
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,439
He's not ignoring you.
You're beautiful.

787
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,439
He knows that you're there.
He's just hedging his bets.

788
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,559
But...

789
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,159
I mean, you have to be really sure
that you actually like him, you know.

790
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,999
That's it's not just that he's the
guy at school to be seen with.

791
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,439
No, I do really like him.

792
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,081
Well, then you have to find a
way to get him to ask you out.

793
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,759
Yes, but how?

794
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,687
Well, for starters, stop dressing
like you're totally easy.

795
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,799
I thought this was sort of sexy,
it's American Apparel.

796
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,679
No, it is sort of sexy.
It's very, very sexy,

797
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,926
but it doesn't leave much to
the imagination, you know?

798
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,405
I guess.

799
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,291
You want to go shopping?

800
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,279
I do.

801
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,439
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

802
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:32,322
OK, good. We're going shopping.

803
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:42,999
Here you go.

804
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,319
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

805
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,759
Good luck on the rest of your album.

806
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,359
- It sounds cool.
- Thank you.

807
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,879
- You have your key?
- Yep. I got it.

808
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,879
Hey, you should come
and sing on a track.

809
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,719
I can't sing. I can
play a bit of guitar,

810
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,559
- if that's...
- We're doing one on Thursday.

811
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,359
It's gonna be simple.
You should come play.

812
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,799
Can I, Dad?

813
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,039
I need to... I need
to contemplate that.

814
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,599
What are you doing?

815
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,604
- That ain't cool.
- What? What?

816
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,639
I don't know if she can play guitar
well enough to play on a track.

817
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,079
I don't want to embarrass her.
What if she can't play?

818
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,562
Look, it's going to be easy.
Let her do it.

819
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,599
Yeah?

820
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,199
Hey, babe? Hey.

821
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:41,719
- Um, where's Violet?
- Well, she's... Violet?

822
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,239
Listen, I was wondering, uh,

823
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,999
you think it would be cool if
she came and played guitar

824
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,519
on one of these songs that
I'm recording on Thursday?

825
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,959
She's terrible at guitar.

826
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,559
- Well, she's not bad.
- She's terrible.

827
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,919
I think she'll be OK.

828
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:00,119
- Well, she's...
- Yeah. 5:00, will you bring her?

829
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,639
I mean, that's up to you.

830
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:04,119
- Yeah. I'll text you the address.
- I mean, I'll bring her.

831
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,249
Why don't you come, too?

832
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:09,079
Mm-mm.

833
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,239
- Come on.
- No way.

834
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,999
Come on. Just come. It'll be fun.

835
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,039
- I want you to come.
- I'll think about it. OK.

836
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,759
I'll come, maybe.

837
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,199
- Thank you.
- All right.

838
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,759
- Bye.
- Thank you.

839
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,239
Bye.

840
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:41,730
You know, it was nice to
see you with Violet today.

841
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,207
- It must be hard not seeing her more.
- Yeah, it's...

842
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,079
So why don't you?

843
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:54,359
I mean, she obviously really
needs her father around.

844
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,559
What, are you the fucking
social services now?

845
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,088
No, no, I mean, I'm just saying.

846
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,959
It must have been fairly
tense for you to leave,

847
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,479
especially seeing as how much
she obviously wants you around.

848
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,763
I... I'm gonna split.
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

849
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,966
Fuck, man. Fuck that shit.

850
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,199
Dan.

851
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,039
Hey, look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

852
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:38,719
What? What do you want from me?
What game are you playing?

853
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,599
What does that mean?

854
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,359
Look, I just...

855
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,479
- What?
- I saw how sweet she was today,

856
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,519
and I just felt sorry for
you being away from that.

857
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:49,199
That is such a crock of shit.
You were back there judging me.

858
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,119
You think that I left
that relationship

859
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,719
because I'm some sort
of selfish, depressed prick,

860
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,439
- which I am, by the way.
- No. I don't think

861
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,159
you're a selfish, depressed prick.
I think you've let your troubles

862
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:01,359
- get in the way of your entire life.
- Oh, babe, babe.

863
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,199
You're really showing
your age right now.

864
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,079
You have no idea what
happens between two people

865
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,999
after 18 years of
marriage, all right?

866
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,159
And because you're willing to
hang around for some asshole

867
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,479
after he totally betrayed you,
that's your business.

868
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,679
I'm sorry, you're right.

869
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,719
I put a lot of time and effort
into that relationship,

870
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,319
and no, I'm not just walking away
because of a bump in the road!

871
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:23,559
"Bump in the road"?
I left that relationship

872
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,719
because I was having a
fucking nervous breakdown,

873
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,839
and she was out there
fucking some other guy,

874
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,919
planning how she was gonna
start a new life with him

875
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,399
when I was here taking
care of my kid.

876
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,239
You have no fucking clue
what you're talking about.

877
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,483
You know nothing!

878
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,919
She goes to Europe to work
on a junket, and, um...

879
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,879
she ends up meeting and
falling in love with a singer.

880
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,759
Bang, boom. Thunder, lightning.

881
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:03,599
Fireworks. The whole bit.

882
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,959
And...

883
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,839
the arrangement was that
they were gonna come back

884
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,359
and tell their partners
that they'd fallen in love

885
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,879
and they were gonna spend
the rest of their lives together.

886
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,919
And so, I go to the
airport to pick her up,

887
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,759
and she just comes out with it,
first off. Whole story.

888
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,959
And next day,
her bags are all packed,

889
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,279
and we're telling Violet
what's gonna happen.

890
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,639
So what did happen?

891
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,879
He choked. He got on the airplane,

892
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,239
went back to his life,
turned his phone off,

893
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:34,759
and she never heard from him again.
I move into another bedroom.

894
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,239
She's waiting around for a
phone call that never comes,

895
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,529
and I turn into a...

896
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,927
I lose my shit a little bit.

897
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,719
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

898
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:54,319
Maybe people in the music industry
just don't make good life partners.

899
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:58,611
- Or fathers.
- Yeah, it certainly looks that way.

900
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,799
I didn't mean about the fathers bit.
You make a very good father.

901
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,799
- Yeah, right.
- Maybe just not a good partner.

902
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,279
What is that?

903
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,439
- This?
- Yeah.

904
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,879
- That's a splitter.
- Oh.

905
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,559
It's for, uh, two headphones
going into one input.

906
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,879
- Yeah.
- It's actually...

907
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,279
- ...from my first date with Miriam.
- It is?

908
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,599
What do you mean?

909
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:30,119
We walked all over the city
listening to her CD player.

910
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,439
Um...

911
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,879
I don't think we said more than two
words to each other the whole night.

912
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,919
That was New Year's Eve, and we
were married two months later.

913
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,759
Wow. That's lovely.

914
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,650
What kind of music you
got on your phone?

915
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,959
I'm not giving you access to
my music library. I'm really not.

916
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,359
There's a lot of embarrassing,
very guilty pleasures in there.

917
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:54,039
Mine, too. You can tell a lot about
a person by what's on their playlist.

918
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,679
I know you can.
That's what's worrying me.

919
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,719
- So are we gonna do this?
- OK.

920
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,759
OK, let's do it.

921
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,039
This is a really good choice!

922
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,119
Oh, yeah.

923
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,319
- Genius.
- Genius.

924
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,199
- Perfect, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

925
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,079
- Great.
- Yeah.

926
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,289
Yeah.

927
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,199
- Oh, no, I forgot...!
- What?

928
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,639
OK, OK, we got to dance!

929
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:08,799
- What?
- We got to dance!

930
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:09,999
All right, all right.

931
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,599
- Yeah, we got to...
- Where?

932
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,359
We got to dance.

933
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:16,206
- This way, I know, I know, I know.
- This way.

934
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:20,039
OK, so, I'm quite frightened,
'cause you might find this cheesy,

935
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:23,479
but it is one of my favorite songs
from one of my favorite films,

936
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,882
so are you ready?

937
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,405
It's good, right?

938
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,039
That's what I love about music.

939
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,359
- What?
- One of the most banal scenes

940
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,239
is suddenly invested with so
much meaning, you know?

941
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,759
All these banalities,

942
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,679
they're suddenly turned into these...

943
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:16,559
these beautiful, effervescent pearls.

944
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,319
From music.

945
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:34,284
I've got to say, as I've gotten
older, these pearls are just...

946
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:38,279
becoming increasingly
more and more rare to me.

947
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,887
More string than pearls?

948
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,959
Yeah. You've got to travel
over a lot more string

949
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,930
to get to the pearls.

950
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,519
This moment is a pearl, Gretta.

951
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,039
It sort of is, isn't it?

952
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,841
All this has been a pearl.

953
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,691
Hey, guys!

954
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,003
- Hi.
- Hello, Steve.

955
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:30,879
Come on and check it out.
Your boyfriend just won a Music Gong.

956
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,759
- No way.
- You won't believe it.

957
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,559
Done something to his face.

958
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,839
Wow, thank you so much.

959
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,119
I'm a bit taken aback by this.
This is incredible.

960
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,959
Uh, it just proves that a guy
from nowhere can actually make it

961
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,919
if he follows his dreams.

962
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,439
I've been practicing this
speech into a shampoo bottle

963
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:54,639
in the shower my entire life. Yeah...

964
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:59,559
- Uh, gosh, thank you.
- Nice beard, you fucking loser.

965
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,799
What dreams? We never
had those dreams.

966
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,279
- I don't remember those dreams.
- How do you know?

967
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,399
Because I know him.

968
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,879
Maybe they were private dreams.

969
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,359
Maybe he just never
told you about them.

970
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,359
Who was I living with
for the last five years?

971
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,359
Baby, you've been living
with a rock star.

972
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,719
Only he didn't know it.

973
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,959
It didn't matter,
but now that he does,

974
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,199
I've got to tell you,
these people get married to it.

975
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,719
They fall in love with the music,
they fall in love with the lights,

976
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:27,759
they fall in love with the road,
the chicks, all that shit.

977
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,959
And no matter how hard he tries,

978
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:33,170
he's never gonna be able
to make a woman happy.

979
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:37,644
All right. See you in the morning.

980
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,879
He just looks a dick!

981
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,719
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know.

982
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,799
Why would anyone?
I'll tell you why he'd do it.

983
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,999
He wants to look like the guy who
doesn't realize... "I've grown a beard.

984
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,279
I was so busy lost inside
myself writing music,

985
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:53,639
I didn't realize I'd grown a
beard the size of my neck."

986
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,771
I'm gonna sound quite cheesy over it.

987
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,959
I loved him like a fool.

988
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:03,119
I don't think that's cheesy. I think
that sounds like a phenomenal song.

989
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,079
- Does it?
- Yeah, it sounds like a song.

990
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,199
I think it sounds like a song
you should write right now.

991
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,599
- Right now?
- Write it down.

992
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,519
- Write it down, write it down.
- OK, OK.

993
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,719
You're in the zone.

994
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,439
- Say, "I'm in the zone."
- I'm in the zone.

995
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,199
Don't say it like a
posh English girl,

996
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,879
- say it like someone in New York.
- Fuck off!

997
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,399
Say, "I'm in the fucking zone."

998
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,359
- I'm in the fucking zone.
- I'm in the fucking zone.

999
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,039
I'm gonna write a song,
I don't give a shit.

1000
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,199
I'm gonna write a song.

1001
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,799
- Actually shut up.
- All right, I'm shushing...

1002
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,319
OK, dialing.

1003
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,479
- All right, here we go.
- Speaker.

1004
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,719
Hey, this is Dave Kohl.

1005
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,999
Uh, I am probably busy doing something
awesome, so leave me a message

1006
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,079
and I probably won't be able
to get back to you at all, ever.

1007
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:11,809
One more?

1008
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,481
Hey.

1009
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:29,559
Everybody, this is, uh...
this is Miriam.

1010
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:30,719
This is Gretta.

1011
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,959
- This is my daughter, Violet.
- Nice to meet you.

1012
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,361
Come on, babe.

1013
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,319
Miriam, thank you. Thank you.

1014
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,639
It's not too high, is it?

1015
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,879
That's not too high
for a bass. Exactly.

1016
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,519
No one should play bass
unless it's this high.

1017
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,119
You want me to set your
amp or are you good? OK.

1018
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:50,319
No, no, no, no, no! Hold up,
hold up, hold up, hold up...

1019
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,639
Rachel, at the top, or...
yeah, at the top,

1020
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,199
come in a little bit more gradually.

1021
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,479
- Fat Jimmy, come on, man.
- What's up?

1022
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,679
- All right, man, all right.
- Police ain't gonna get you up here.

1023
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,399
Let's hear that bass, my brother.

1024
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,239
- I got you, baby, I got you.
- Come on, man.

1025
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,959
I'm sorry, wait a minute.
Um, do you play bass?

1026
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,479
You were out of tune. You were flat.

1027
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,999
'Cause I read on the Internet
that you used to play bass.

1028
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,639
So, um, I think seeing
as we've got Violet

1029
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,199
doing some guitar on this,
this should be a family affair.

1030
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,719
I'm a producer 'cause I
don't play bass, baby.

1031
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:19,479
Yes, you are... You got to do it.

1032
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,039
You got to do it...

1033
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,039
All right, all right.

1034
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,479
Come in whenever you want,
you know? You can wait.

1035
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,039
Just, you know, keep it simple.

1036
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,919
- OK.
- You're gonna be great.

1037
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,159
- I don't even know if I'm gonna play.
- Whatever.

1038
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,439
If you feel like it, do it, OK?

1039
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,799
You know, it's totally cool.

1040
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,199
You know, but don't feel like
you have to overdo it

1041
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,919
or prove anything.
These guys are serious musicians.

1042
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,479
Guys, can we...
Sorry. Can we take five?

1043
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:46,202
All right, let's take five.
Five, not ten.

1044
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,839
Hey. I'm back in New York for a gig.

1045
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:55,359
I got your singing message.
I have to see you.

1046
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,525
Uh, call me. Please call me.

1047
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:32,199
- Turn down that motherfucking music!
- Give us three more minutes!

1048
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:36,286
- I'm calling the cops!
- You're not calling the cops!

1049
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:21,399
Oh my God! Oh, Violet!

1050
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:31,919
And now the police!
Come on, let's go.

1051
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,919
- Hello.
- Congratulations.

1052
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:51,519
Thank you. We should
have a toast right now.

1053
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,924
- To your album?
- To our album.

1054
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:02,199
- Really?
- All right. Don't get too excited.

1055
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,967
- I'm just trying it out.
- OK.

1056
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,968
Should we toast with that?

1057
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,559
Goddamn, how do people drink that?

1058
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,599
We're gonna play a game, OK?

1059
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:28,799
We're gonna play a song that
is impossible to not dance to.

1060
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,359
I defy you not to dance to this song.

1061
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,531
This is good. This is good!

1062
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:49,279
You know you want to.
You know you want to!

1063
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:53,685
You know you want to. So where is it?

1064
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:57,719
You know you want to. You do, you do.

1065
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:00,359
There it is! There it is!

1066
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,131
I'll see you.

1067
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,599
I'm gonna give them a ride home.

1068
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,839
- Cool.
- Good night.

1069
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,241
Good night.

1070
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:53,079
- Bye.
- Thank you for everything.

1071
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:54,679
No, thank you for everything.

1072
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:57,879
- See you.
- Bye!

1073
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:00,159
- Good night, Gretta.
- Good night, Gretta.

1074
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:03,189
It's gonna be awesome.

1075
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,079
So, how was touring?

1076
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:48,639
Touring was amazing,
grueling, punishing,

1077
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:51,327
- inspiring.
- Did you find yourself?

1078
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:53,039
I don't know.

1079
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,799
You certainly found a beard,
anyway. Look at that thing.

1080
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,079
Yeah. It's... it's intense.

1081
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,050
- It's big.
- Yeah.

1082
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,919
Did Mim go with you? On tour?

1083
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,679
You want to go straight
into this, then?

1084
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,039
- Yeah?
- Are you...

1085
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:12,919
are you the happiest couple ever?
Or did you... break up after a month

1086
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:14,759
and she came back to
New York on a bus?

1087
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:19,927
It was a train... actually.

1088
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,039
I'm sorry. I'm being a bitch.

1089
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:25,489
No. You're entitled.

1090
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:31,599
So... what have you been up to?

1091
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:39,559
God...

1092
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:42,519
It's... amazing, Gretta.

1093
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:44,119
- Really?
- Totally.

1094
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:47,808
Ambient sound, and... the city.

1095
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,439
That's it? No overdubs? Nothing?

1096
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:52,119
No, no, no, it's just
the way you hear it.

1097
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:54,679
- God, it's so great.
- Yeah.

1098
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:57,559
- They're really offering you a deal?
- No... well, I don't know.

1099
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:02,648
He has to play it to his
partner first. So we'll see.

1100
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,839
I cannot believe what he's
done with your songs.

1101
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,279
I know. He's amazing.

1102
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:10,999
- You should get him to do your record.
- No, it's too late.

1103
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,959
We just finished mastering
the record in LA.

1104
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,879
I recorded in various
studios on the road.

1105
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:20,119
- Wow. So, what's it called?
- "On the Road."

1106
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:25,288
Kind of like Kerouac.

1107
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,399
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

1108
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,609
That's actually a
terrible album name.

1109
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,319
No, I...

1110
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:36,719
- I mean, it worked for him.
- No. It's bad.

1111
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:39,479
- It's...
- I know that you know it's bad, too.

1112
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,599
No, I'm...

1113
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:45,159
- you know...
- Anyway, would you like to go hear it?

1114
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:47,679
- I would love to hear it.
- OK.

1115
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:18,644
All right... what do you think?

1116
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:22,239
I think I need to listen to it again.

1117
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:25,639
No. No, I want... I want
your immediate reaction.

1118
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:28,042
- My immediate reaction?
- Mm-hmm.

1119
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,199
OK, um...

1120
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:34,679
I... I think that you've lost
the songs in the production.

1121
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:37,319
You know? I mean, OK,
take "Lost Stars."

1122
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:40,639
I wrote it as a... as a ballad,
and... I don't know,

1123
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:42,959
- it sounds like a piece of stadium pop.
- Ooh.

1124
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,399
Yeah, but I wanted
to turn it into a hit.

1125
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:48,039
- Why?
- "Why?" What kind of question is that?

1126
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:50,159
You're the writer.
You get sole writing credit on it.

1127
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:52,599
- This is huge for you.
- Yeah, but, I mean,

1128
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:56,759
you weren't supposed to lose the
song in it, you know? I mean, it's...

1129
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:59,639
it's delicate. I really... I just...

1130
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:01,239
I think you should get it remixed.

1131
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:03,479
Ah, but everyone loves it
when we do it. It's amazing.

1132
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:05,079
You have to come see it live.

1133
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,519
The reaction to it, the energy
in the room just changes.

1134
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,559
Why are you so worried about
what other people think?

1135
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,399
It's... it's our song.

1136
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:13,519
It is, but, you know,
isn't that what music is about?

1137
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:16,599
- It's about sharing it with people.
- No, not that song, Dave.

1138
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:19,919
OK, well, good, then who
do we get to remix this?

1139
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,799
Mim. Maybe you should
get Mim to remix it.

1140
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:24,959
Really? OK, so this is obviously
not anything about the album.

1141
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,407
You think?

1142
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:31,759
Don't. Don't become this, like,

1143
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:33,759
music biz couple, you know?

1144
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,919
Arguing about our, um... our albums.

1145
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:42,959
The funny thing about this is that I'd
throw that fucking record into the ocean

1146
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:45,319
if we could just continue
this conversation right now.

1147
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,719
This is what I want
to talk about. OK?

1148
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:50,919
And if I could somehow say
something or do anything

1149
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:53,559
that would undo what
I did to us, then...

1150
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:56,406
just tell me what it is. Help me.

1151
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,440
Would you?

1152
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,648
Would you throw it in the ocean?

1153
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:06,082
Would you... would you want me to?

1154
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,159
No.

1155
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:15,767
No, I just, you know, I think...

1156
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:21,719
I think everything's changed.

1157
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:25,479
And I'm... I'm just finding
it a bit hard to adjust.

1158
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:28,119
I know. It makes sense.

1159
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:30,199
But we're just gonna
have to find a way to...

1160
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,967
get through this,
get through this together.

1161
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,519
When did you, like,
when did you realize that?

1162
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:38,999
When you sang to me on my voice-mail.

1163
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,639
I realized that nobody on
Earth in their right mind

1164
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:46,159
would ever do anything remotely
like that, and... that killed me.

1165
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:48,919
That crushed me. You...

1166
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:50,959
completely won me over.

1167
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:54,199
I wasn't trying to win you over,
I was trying to tell you to fuck off.

1168
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:56,489
And I had. And...

1169
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:00,691
and now, you know, you've...
you've come back and...

1170
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:04,999
and you've opened the whole thing up
again, and I think, actually, I think...

1171
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,759
I think I'm gonna have to go.
Um, take that.

1172
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:10,239
I'm gonna go,
'cause it's all a bit much.

1173
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:12,559
I hear you. Just...

1174
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:16,199
take your time.
I'm not going anywhere.

1175
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:18,959
- You're gonna stay on the bench?
- Yes, I'm gonna live on this bench.

1176
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,283
Uh-huh.

1177
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,239
Come to the Gramercy.

1178
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,439
On Saturday. Please.

1179
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:30,679
Just hear the song.
I want you to see...

1180
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:34,163
how everyone's just falling in
love with what you created.

1181
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,209
Please don't play it like that.

1182
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,879
OK.

1183
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:57,801
Well, look at you. A vision of
pure class. There's my daughter.

1184
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,879
- No way.
- There it is.

1185
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,039
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

1186
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,079
- There you are.
- Yeah.

1187
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,079
You look great.
Look how cool you are.

1188
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,759
Can I keep this? Show all my friends?

1189
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,719
Hell, yeah.
That's what it's for, babe.

1190
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:14,919
- Look at you. Hilarious.
- Why is that hilarious?

1191
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:17,719
I just had no idea you
were that talented.

1192
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,359
I mean, I just didn't know.

1193
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,519
You're, like...
you're a real guitar player.

1194
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:23,879
You got... you got
some talent. Seriously.

1195
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:26,199
What, do you want me to
start a band now, and...?

1196
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:28,039
Yeah. Let's start a band.

1197
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,279
- "Let's start a band"?
- Yeah. Why not?

1198
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:32,079
I'll record you. I'll produce you.

1199
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:33,599
I like this idea.

1200
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,279
- Do you?
- Yeah.

1201
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,999
You all... motivated now?

1202
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,919
It's a family business.
It's like the Jackson Five.

1203
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:44,279
- There you go.
- The Mulligan Three.

1204
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:46,159
- You coming in?
- No. I'm gonna go...

1205
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:48,319
I'm gonna go play that for Saul,
see if we can get a deal.

1206
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:51,041
Good luck. Let me know how it goes.

1207
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,607
I love you.

1208
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,925
I know you do.

1209
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:04,001
Hey.

1210
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:09,201
Come on. Yeah. So pretty.

1211
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,690
Bye.

1212
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:24,799
Thanks for coming in, guys.

1213
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:27,119
This is fantastic.
You got a great record.

1214
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:30,919
And... I missed it on the first listen,
but I don't want to miss it again.

1215
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:33,879
We're very glad
that you like it. So...

1216
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:37,319
Well, I reached out to some
of my studio connects in LA,

1217
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:39,079
and I was thinking we
can get the first track

1218
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:41,599
placed in a... in a film,
the right film.

1219
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,399
There's also pilot season right now.

1220
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,479
Yeah, we're not interested
in any of that stuff.

1221
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:50,479
OK, so then... what are you
interested in? What are we doing here?

1222
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:53,531
Well, I think Dan needs his job back.

1223
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:57,323
Yeah, sure. What?
Take my office. I don't care.

1224
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:00,199
OK, all right, so how, I mean...

1225
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:02,119
I guess I want to know...
how does this work?

1226
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:05,639
We put the album out,
we sell it for...?

1227
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:08,679
Let's say an album
costs ten dollars a unit.

1228
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:10,799
The artist gets a dollar.

1229
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,599
Same in publishing...
it's a buck for a book.

1230
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,919
I think I'm just thinking
for this specifically...

1231
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,199
to get my head around it...

1232
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:19,559
Um, I mean, the album,
it doesn't have any overhead,

1233
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,799
- because... we did it.
- Yeah.

1234
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,799
And then distribution, I mean,
it's not gonna go in stores,

1235
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:28,519
it's gonna go online, and publicity
would be, what, word of mouth?

1236
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:31,279
So I think what I'm wondering is...

1237
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:33,519
why do you get nine out
of ten of my dollars?

1238
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,879
Gretta, you're a very
smart young woman,

1239
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,799
and, uh, you're a determined artist,

1240
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,919
and you have a... you have
a wonderful project here.

1241
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,799
And with the right team behind
you to push you and guide you

1242
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:49,039
in the right direction and maybe hire
a producer to remix a couple tracks,

1243
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:52,359
you could have a hit record
and a very long career,

1244
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:56,879
but, you know, ultimately,
that's... that's up to you.

1245
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,439
Ah, you had them. You wound him up.

1246
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:02,479
I know. It's amazing when you're
not actually that interested,

1247
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:03,679
you always win the hand.

1248
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:07,599
Yeah, that's never really
worked out that well for me.

1249
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,679
- I mean, I found it worked very well.
- Yeah.

1250
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:11,559
You're gonna get a deal.

1251
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:13,439
That asshole is gonna
give you a deal, babe.

1252
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:15,839
You might have to compromise
a little bit, but...

1253
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,999
- Never.
- Of course.

1254
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,959
Hey, we should do a bunch of these.

1255
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:22,399
- What do you mean?
- Could do, like, the, uh...

1256
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,239
"The European Series."

1257
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:27,319
- I like that.
- "Paris Tapes." "Prague Sessions."

1258
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:29,279
"The Berlin... Recordings."

1259
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:30,999
- Yes.
- Go all over Europe by rail.

1260
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,039
We could take the whole gang.
You know?

1261
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:36,523
Rachel, Malcolm, Steve.

1262
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:40,401
- So...
- So...

1263
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:46,044
Look, I guess I'll
see you in a while.

1264
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:48,401
Thank you.

1265
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:30,526
Thank you so much.

1266
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:33,919
Oh, man.

1267
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:35,959
Thank you.

1268
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:38,239
- Guitar change. All right.
- All right!

1269
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:42,239
Uh, so this next song
was actually given to me

1270
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:45,199
by an amazing songwriter and
an even more amazing woman.

1271
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:49,399
Uh, yeah. So it's a very special song...
we're gonna do her arrangement of it.

1272
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:53,079
So... If she's here,
I'm not sure that she is...

1273
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:55,759
uh, I'd love her to come up
and join us on this one.

1274
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,999
There's a guitar right there, so...
you know, if you're here, please...

1275
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,559
please join us. It's a really
special song to me, so...

1276
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:04,399
See your vision of this song through.

1277
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,639
- Hey.
- Hey.

1278
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:54,931
- Where are you going?
- Uh... home.

1279
01:41:56,960 --> 01:42:00,119
- What's on your mind?
- OK, um...

1280
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:03,205
I don't want your label
to release my album.

1281
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:04,919
Fine.

1282
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:07,079
- Fine? Really?
- Well...

1283
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:09,239
No, because I thought
that you'd be really upset.

1284
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:10,719
No. It's your album.

1285
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:13,839
So, what do you want
to do with it, then?

1286
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:14,999
- There it is.
- Yeah.

1287
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,759
That's the whole album for a dollar.

1288
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:18,679
A buck for a book. The whole thing.

1289
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:21,119
Now, once this goes out, that's it.

1290
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:22,599
- They're gone.
- Yeah.

1291
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,479
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- Yeah.

1292
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:27,079
- How about two bucks?
- You're such a capitalist.

1293
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:30,679
No, a buck is fair, and then, you know,
we'll split it evenly between everyone

1294
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:32,799
and Malcolm and Rachel...
everyone. Come on.

1295
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:38,159
Once I press this, that's it.
I'm going to war with my whole business.

1296
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:39,891
Mm...

1297
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:49,799
That's so exciting.

1298
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:52,079
- OK...
- What are you doing?

1299
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:54,005
Calling reinforcements.

1300
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:57,559
- Whoa.
- What?

1301
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:00,559
Check it out. I got Troublegum
to tweet out the album.

1302
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:02,559
How many followers does he have?

1303
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:04,839
Apparently the entire world.

1304
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:07,519
Just about every living
human being follows him.

1305
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:11,359
Mr. Mulligan.

1306
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,239
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1307
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:16,291
News for you on the Interwebs.

1308
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:19,759
- Shit.
- You didn't know nothing about this?

1309
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,399
- No. How many did she sell?
- No?

1310
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:23,879
10,000. Today.

1311
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:26,959
- Troublegum tweeted about it.
- Man, if Troublegum helped her out,

1312
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,719
it's because he liked her, all right?

1313
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:30,999
They're artists. They're great...

1314
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,239
- You didn't know nothing about this?
- Nothing. It's kind of funny, though.

1315
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:36,839
- Is it really?
- It's pretty funny, man.

1316
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:38,919
Boo-boo, you know
how to pick 'em, boy.

1317
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:40,239
It's kind of good. It's good.

1318
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:41,679
- It is. It's kind of epic.
- Yeah.

1319
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:43,525
Clean out your locker.

1320
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:45,931
See you later.
