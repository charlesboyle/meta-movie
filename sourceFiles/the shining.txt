00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,778
Hi. I've got an appointment
with Mr. Ullman.

2
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,864
My name is Jack Torrance.

3
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:19,659
His office is the first door
on the left.

4
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:21,035
Thank you.

5
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:39,223
Mr. Ullman?

6
00:03:39,515 --> 00:03:40,726
I'm Jack Torrance.

7
00:03:40,976 --> 00:03:42,936
Come on in, Jack.

8
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,524
-Very nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

9
00:03:46,774 --> 00:03:48,319
This is my secretary, Susie.

10
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:51,196
-Susie, how do you do?
-Any trouble finding us?

11
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:54,199
No problem at all.
I made the trip in 3 1/2 hours.

12
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:56,369
That's very good time.

13
00:03:56,745 --> 00:03:58,288
Sit down a minute, Jack.

14
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,290
Just make yourself at home.

15
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,708
Like some coffee?

16
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,462
lf you're having some,
I wouldn't mind. Thanks.

17
00:04:04,713 --> 00:04:05,589
-Susie.
-Sure.

18
00:04:05,881 --> 00:04:07,548
And ask Bill Watson to join us.

19
00:04:07,798 --> 00:04:09,300
Yes, I will.

20
00:04:20,104 --> 00:04:21,272
Mom?

21
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:23,274
Yeah?

22
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,279
Do you really want to go and live
in that hotel for the winter?

23
00:04:27,947 --> 00:04:29,240
Sure I do.

24
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:31,409
lt'll be lots of fun.

25
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:35,414
Yeah. I guess so.

26
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:39,794
Anyway, there's hardly anybody
to play with around here.

27
00:04:40,586 --> 00:04:44,132
I know. lt always takes
a little time to make new friends.

28
00:04:45,677 --> 00:04:47,971
Yeah, I guess so.

29
00:04:48,763 --> 00:04:49,722
What about Tony?

30
00:04:50,015 --> 00:04:52,267
He's looking forward
to the hotel, I bet.

31
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:55,312
No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.

32
00:04:55,688 --> 00:04:58,024
Now, come on, Tony.
Don't be silly.

33
00:04:58,525 --> 00:05:00,443
I don't want to go there.

34
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:02,988
How come you don't want to go?

35
00:05:03,238 --> 00:05:05,156
I just don't.

36
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:07,786
Let's just wait and see.

37
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:10,755
We're all going to have
a real good time.

38
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,599
Bill, I'd like you
to meet Jack Torrance.

39
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,233
How do you do, Bill?

40
00:05:16,435 --> 00:05:18,403
-Nice to meet you.
-Pleasure to meet you.

41
00:05:18,604 --> 00:05:20,538
Grab a chair, Bill. Join in.

42
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:24,870
Jack is going to take care of
the Overlook for us this winter.

43
00:05:25,111 --> 00:05:28,080
I'd like you to take him around
soon as we're through.

44
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:29,215
Fine.

45
00:05:29,852 --> 00:05:31,752
Jack is a schoolteacher.

46
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,988
Formerly a schoolteacher.

47
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:35,884
What line of work are you in now?

48
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:37,684
I'm a writer.

49
00:05:37,927 --> 00:05:41,556
Teaching's been more or less
a way of making ends meet.

50
00:05:41,764 --> 00:05:43,732
This ought to be
quite a change for you.

51
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:46,465
I'm looking for a change.

52
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:50,266
Our people in Denver recommended
Jack very highly, and for once...

53
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,067
...I agree with them.

54
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:54,509
Let's see, where were we?

55
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:57,307
I was about to explain...

56
00:05:57,549 --> 00:06:01,714
...that our season here runs from
May 15th to October 30th.

57
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:05,379
Then we close down completely
until the following May.

58
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:08,390
Do you mind if I ask
why you do that?

59
00:06:08,596 --> 00:06:12,054
It seems to me that the skiing
up here would be fantastic.

60
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:14,861
It would be. The problem is
the enormous cost...

61
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:17,630
...it would be to keep
the road to Sidewinder open.

62
00:06:18,274 --> 00:06:20,003
It's a 25-mile stretch of road.

63
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:22,575
It gets 20 feet of snow
during the winter.

64
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:26,010
There's just no way to make it
economically feasible...

65
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:28,150
...to keep it clear.

66
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:30,718
When the place was built in 1907...

67
00:06:30,922 --> 00:06:33,483
...there was very little interest
in winter sports.

68
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:38,561
This site was chosen for its
seclusion and scenic beauty.

69
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:41,323
It's certainly got
plenty of that.

70
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,728
That's right.

71
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:45,762
Did they give you
any idea in Denver. . .

72
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:47,639
. . .about what the job entails?

73
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:49,976
Only in a very general way.

74
00:06:52,187 --> 00:06:54,857
The winters can be
fantastically cruel.

75
00:06:55,107 --> 00:06:58,444
The basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage. . .

76
00:06:58,736 --> 00:07:00,654
. . .and depreciation
which can occur.

77
00:07:00,905 --> 00:07:03,325
This consists mainly
of running the boiler. . .

78
00:07:03,575 --> 00:07:07,496
. . .heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis. . .

79
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:10,375
. . .repairing damage as it occurs. . .

80
00:07:10,668 --> 00:07:13,462
. . .and doing repairs so the
elements can't get a foothold.

81
00:07:14,546 --> 00:07:16,799
That sounds fine to me.

82
00:07:17,174 --> 00:07:20,095
Physically, it's not
a very demanding job.

83
00:07:20,303 --> 00:07:23,431
The only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter. . .

84
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:26,310
. . .is a tremendous sense
of isolation.

85
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:32,066
That just happens to be
exactly what I'm looking for.

86
00:07:32,442 --> 00:07:35,571
I'm outlining a new
writing project.

87
00:07:35,947 --> 00:07:39,242
Five months of peace
is just what I want.

88
00:07:40,034 --> 00:07:41,787
That's very good, Jack.

89
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,206
Because, for some people. . .

90
00:07:45,415 --> 00:07:47,166
. . .solitude. . .

91
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:48,960
. . .and isolation. . .

92
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,090
. . .can, of itself, become a problem.

93
00:07:52,924 --> 00:07:54,592
Not for me.

94
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:58,264
How about your wife and son?
Do you think they'll take to it?

95
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:01,183
They'll love it.

96
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:02,685
Great.

97
00:08:05,605 --> 00:08:08,775
Before I turn you over to Bill. . .

98
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:12,446
. . .there's one other thing I think
we should talk about.

99
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,158
Not to sound melodramatic. . .

100
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:16,910
. . .but it's been known to
give a few people. . .

101
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:19,329
. . .second thoughts about the job.

102
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:21,666
I'm intrigued.

103
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,210
I don't suppose they
said anything in Denver. . .

104
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:28,382
. . .about the tragedy we had up here
during the winter of 1970.

105
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,968
I don't believe they did.

106
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,265
My predecessor in this job. . .

107
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,270
. . .hired a man named Charles Grady
as the winter caretaker.

108
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,940
He came up with his wife and
2 little girls of about 8 and 10.

109
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:46,195
He had a good employment record,
good references.

110
00:08:46,445 --> 00:08:48,655
And from what I've been told,
he seemed. . .

111
00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:51,533
. . .like a completely
normal individual.

112
00:08:51,827 --> 00:08:54,121
But at some point
during the winter. . .

113
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:58,000
. . .he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown.

114
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,545
He ran amuck. . .

115
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:06,134
. . .and killed his family
with an ax.

116
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,058
Stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing, and then. . .

117
00:09:12,893 --> 00:09:16,564
. . .he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth.

118
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,609
The police thought. . .

119
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:23,864
. . .that it was what the old-timers
used to call cabin fever.

120
00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:27,118
A kind of claustrophobic reaction
which can occur. . .

121
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:31,498
. . .when people are shut in together
over long periods of time.

122
00:09:36,586 --> 00:09:37,921
That is. . .

123
00:09:38,171 --> 00:09:39,674
. . .quite a story.

124
00:09:41,008 --> 00:09:42,468
Yeah, it is.

125
00:09:43,553 --> 00:09:46,932
lt's still hard for me to believe
it actually happened here.

126
00:09:47,224 --> 00:09:48,892
But it did.

127
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:54,691
I think you can appreciate
why I wanted to tell you about it.

128
00:09:55,276 --> 00:09:57,737
I certainly can.

129
00:09:58,237 --> 00:10:00,823
I also understand
why your people in Denver. . .

130
00:10:01,073 --> 00:10:03,285
. . .left it for you to tell me.

131
00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:07,164
Obviously, some people
can be put off. . .

132
00:10:07,414 --> 00:10:11,461
. . .from staying in a place where
something like that happened.

133
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:16,549
You can rest assured that's not
going to happen with me.

134
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,430
And as far as my wife
is concerned. . .

135
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,517
. . .I'm sure she'll be absolutely
fascinated when I tell her.

136
00:10:24,768 --> 00:10:27,521
She's a confirmed ghost story. . .

137
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:30,149
. . .and horror film addict.

138
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:39,743
Tony, do you think
Dad'll get the job?

139
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:43,373
He already did.

140
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,502
He's going to phone Wendy up
in a few minutes to tell her.

141
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,898
-Hi, babe.
-Hi, hon. How's it going?

142
00:11:05,148 --> 00:11:08,652
Great. I'm at the hotel and
I still have a lot to do.

143
00:11:08,944 --> 00:11:11,989
I don't think I can get home
before 9 or 10.

144
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,699
Sounds like you got the job.

145
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:16,620
Right. lt's a beautiful place.

146
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,956
You and Danny are going to love it.

147
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,377
Tony, why don't you want to go
to the hotel?

148
00:11:23,627 --> 00:11:25,337
I don't know.

149
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,968
You do too know.
Now come on, tell me.

150
00:11:30,552 --> 00:11:32,637
I don't want to.

151
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:34,597
Please.

152
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:36,935
No.

153
00:11:37,227 --> 00:11:39,354
Now, Tony, tell me.

154
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,646
Now, hold your eyes still
so I can see.

155
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,355
That's good. Now the other one.

156
00:12:19,762 --> 00:12:21,229
Good boy.

157
00:12:28,572 --> 00:12:29,938
Now, Danny...

158
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:32,433
...when you were brushing
your teeth...

159
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:35,636
...do you remember if you
smelled anything funny...

160
00:12:35,848 --> 00:12:40,616
...or saw any bright, flashing
lights or anything at all strange?

161
00:12:43,457 --> 00:12:44,617
No.

162
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:48,184
Do you remember when you were
brushing your teeth?

163
00:12:48,763 --> 00:12:50,060
Yes.

164
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:54,829
What's the next thing you remember
after you were brushing your teeth?

165
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:01,671
My mom was saying, "Wake up.
Wake up, Danny, wake up."

166
00:13:05,883 --> 00:13:08,113
Can you remember
what you were doing...

167
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:11,255
...just before you started
brushing your teeth?

168
00:13:13,758 --> 00:13:15,521
Talking to Tony.

169
00:13:16,193 --> 00:13:18,560
Is Tony one of your animals?

170
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:22,367
No. He's a little boy
that lives in my mouth.

171
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:25,069
Tony's his imaginary friend.

172
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:31,409
If you were to open your mouth now,
could I see Tony?

173
00:13:34,082 --> 00:13:35,310
Why not?

174
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:38,415
Because he hides.

175
00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:40,817
Where does he go?

176
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:43,722
To my stomach.

177
00:13:45,762 --> 00:13:48,664
Does Tony ever tell you
to do things?

178
00:13:52,737 --> 00:13:55,399
I don't want to talk
about Tony anymore.

179
00:13:58,044 --> 00:13:59,477
That's fine.

180
00:14:00,246 --> 00:14:02,043
All right, Danny.

181
00:14:02,849 --> 00:14:05,648
I'm going to ask you
to do me a favor...

182
00:14:05,853 --> 00:14:09,220
...and stay quietly in bed
for the rest of the day. Okay?

183
00:14:09,423 --> 00:14:10,549
Do I have to?

184
00:14:10,758 --> 00:14:13,023
Yes. I'd like you to.

185
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,992
We're going in the other room
for a few minutes and talk.

186
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:18,325
I'll come back and check on you.

187
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:29,245
-Shall we go into the living room?
-Yes.

188
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:34,817
-Please.
-Thank you.

189
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:43,062
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

190
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:47,291
I'm quite sure there's nothing
physically wrong with Danny.

191
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,168
He seems absolutely fine now.

192
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:56,366
But you should've seen him.

193
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:58,070
I know.

194
00:14:58,281 --> 00:14:59,976
Kids can scare you to death.

195
00:15:00,184 --> 00:15:03,050
But believe me, these episodes
are not at all uncommon.

196
00:15:03,253 --> 00:15:05,814
And they look much worse
than they are.

197
00:15:06,357 --> 00:15:09,019
But what was the matter with him?

198
00:15:09,226 --> 00:15:13,322
Most of the time, these episodes
with kids are never explained.

199
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:18,401
They're brought on by emotional
factors and rarely occur again.

200
00:15:19,204 --> 00:15:22,174
They're more akin
to autohypnosis...

201
00:15:22,376 --> 00:15:25,345
...a kind of self-induced trance.

202
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:27,537
If it reoccurs, which I doubt...

203
00:15:28,415 --> 00:15:31,510
...we can always think about
having some tests done.

204
00:15:34,122 --> 00:15:36,386
I'm sure you're right.

205
00:15:38,027 --> 00:15:40,723
Have you been in Boulder long?

206
00:15:41,531 --> 00:15:42,828
Only about three months.

207
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:46,401
We're from Vermont. My husband
was teaching school there.

208
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:52,206
Did the appearance
of Danny's imaginary friend....

209
00:15:52,644 --> 00:15:53,474
Tony.

210
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,638
Did Tony's first appearance happen
to coincide with your arrival here?

211
00:16:00,754 --> 00:16:02,085
Let's see....

212
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,350
I guess Danny started
talking to Tony...

213
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:08,256
...about the time we put him
in nursery school.

214
00:16:08,663 --> 00:16:10,961
Did he adjust well to school?

215
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:15,102
He didn't like it too much
at first.

216
00:16:15,303 --> 00:16:18,603
Then he had an injury, so we kept
him out for a while and....

217
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:23,912
I guess that's about when I first
noticed he was talking to Tony.

218
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,316
What sort of injury did he have?

219
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:30,147
He dislocated his shoulder.

220
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,887
How did he manage to do that?

221
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,389
It was just one of
those things, you know.

222
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,590
Purely an accident.

223
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,368
My husband had been drinking...

224
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:48,907
...and he came home
about three hours late.

225
00:16:49,211 --> 00:16:53,772
So he wasn't exactly
in the greatest mood that night.

226
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:59,283
And Danny had scattered some of his
school papers all over the room...

227
00:16:59,488 --> 00:17:03,789
...and my husband grabbed his arm
to pull him away from them.

228
00:17:03,994 --> 00:17:07,054
It's just the sort of thing you do
100 times with a child...

229
00:17:07,264 --> 00:17:09,289
...you know, in a park
or in the street.

230
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:13,030
But on this particular occasion...

231
00:17:13,238 --> 00:17:15,866
...my husband just used
too much strength...

232
00:17:16,074 --> 00:17:18,669
...and he injured Danny's arm.

233
00:17:21,714 --> 00:17:26,243
Anyway, something good did come out
of it all because he said...

234
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:29,047
..."Wendy, I'm never going to
touch another drop.

235
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,191
And if I do, you can leave me."

236
00:17:31,392 --> 00:17:32,723
And he didn't.

237
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:37,422
He hasn't had any
alcohol in 5 months.

238
00:18:04,476 --> 00:18:08,648
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.

239
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,489
Dad?

240
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:20,035
I'm hungry.

241
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,583
You should've eaten your breakfast.

242
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:28,296
We'll get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel.

243
00:18:28,547 --> 00:18:30,174
Okay, Mom.

244
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:35,762
Wasn't it around here that
the Donner party got snowbound?

245
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:41,018
I think that was farther west,
in the Sierras.

246
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:44,898
What was the Donner party?

247
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:51,071
They were a party of settlers
in covered wagon times.

248
00:18:51,322 --> 00:18:54,534
They got snowbound one winter
in the mountains.

249
00:18:54,743 --> 00:18:58,997
They had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive.

250
00:19:00,082 --> 00:19:03,002
You mean they ate each other up?

251
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:06,297
They had to, in order to survive.

252
00:19:06,548 --> 00:19:07,759
Jack.

253
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:09,052
Don't worry, Mom.

254
00:19:09,302 --> 00:19:13,515
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.

255
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:16,435
See, it's okay.

256
00:19:16,644 --> 00:19:19,063
He saw it on the television.

257
00:19:49,808 --> 00:19:51,601
-What time does the plane leave?
-8:30.

258
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:54,564
That gives us plenty of time
to go over everything.

259
00:19:54,814 --> 00:19:56,732
-Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
-Bye.

260
00:19:56,983 --> 00:20:00,069
Good morning. I hope you
haven't been waiting too long.

261
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:02,906
No problem. We had time
to grab a bite to eat.

262
00:20:03,157 --> 00:20:05,993
Good. Glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen.

263
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:07,912
ls your family
having a look around?

264
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:11,500
No, my son's
discovered the games room.

265
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,795
-Has your luggage been brought in?
-Right there.

266
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:17,298
ln view of all we have
to cover today. . .

267
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,178
. . .I suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started.

268
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,181
Have the Torrances' things
brought to their apartment.

269
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,143
I'd better collect my family first.

270
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,613
This is our Colorado Lounge.

271
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:40,240
lt's beautiful.

272
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:42,494
My God!

273
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:45,246
This place is fantastic,
isn't it, hon?

274
00:20:45,497 --> 00:20:46,831
lt sure is.

275
00:20:46,853 --> 00:20:49,652
I've never seen anything
like this before.

276
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:53,261
Are all these
lndian designs authentic?

277
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:54,894
I believe they're based...

278
00:20:55,096 --> 00:20:58,294
...mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

279
00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:00,469
They're really gorgeous.

280
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,694
As a matter of fact...

281
00:21:01,904 --> 00:21:04,999
...this is probably the most
gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.

282
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:08,378
This old place has had
an illustrious past.

283
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:11,673
In its heyday, it was a stopping
place for the jet setters...

284
00:21:11,883 --> 00:21:14,853
...even before anybody knew
what a jet set was.

285
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:18,114
We had four presidents
who stayed here.

286
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,652
Lots of movie stars.

287
00:21:19,858 --> 00:21:21,417
Royalty?

288
00:21:21,795 --> 00:21:23,194
All the best people.

289
00:22:16,985 --> 00:22:19,570
This is the staff wing
of the hotel.

290
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:23,867
None of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter.

291
00:22:24,117 --> 00:22:26,995
-Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
-Goodbye, girls.

292
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,164
And here are your quarters.

293
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:32,210
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

294
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,005
And a small bedroom for your son.

295
00:22:38,551 --> 00:22:40,595
Perfect for a child.

296
00:22:47,127 --> 00:22:50,585
Well, then. Place is
very nicely self-contained.

297
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,357
Easy to keep.

298
00:22:55,137 --> 00:22:56,195
Cozy.

299
00:22:56,405 --> 00:22:58,669
Yes, very cozy for a family.

300
00:22:58,908 --> 00:23:00,569
If you feel like spreading out...

301
00:23:00,776 --> 00:23:03,439
...you have the rest of the hotel
to move around in.

302
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:07,573
Well, it's very...

303
00:23:08,118 --> 00:23:09,416
...homey.

304
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,588
This is our famous hedge maze.

305
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:19,094
It's quite an attraction here.
The walls are 13 feet high...

306
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:21,597
...and the hedge is as old
as the hotel itself.

307
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:24,429
A lot of fun, but I wouldn't
want to go in there...

308
00:23:24,638 --> 00:23:27,630
...unless I had an hour
to spare to find my way out.

309
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:31,136
When was the Overlook built?

310
00:23:32,147 --> 00:23:34,378
Construction started in 1907.

311
00:23:34,584 --> 00:23:36,552
It was finished in 1909.

312
00:23:36,752 --> 00:23:39,414
The site's supposed to be
on an lndian burial ground.

313
00:23:39,622 --> 00:23:41,250
They actually had to repel...

314
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:44,359
...a few lndian attacks as they
were building it.

315
00:23:44,962 --> 00:23:46,862
That's our Snowcat.

316
00:23:47,564 --> 00:23:49,590
Can you both drive a car?

317
00:23:50,135 --> 00:23:53,696
That's fine. Basically the Snowcat
operates very much like a car.

318
00:23:53,906 --> 00:23:56,467
It won't take you long
to get the hang of it.

319
00:23:57,677 --> 00:24:01,044
As a matter of fact, we brought
a decorator in from Chicago...

320
00:24:01,248 --> 00:24:04,377
...just last year to refurbish
this part of the hotel.

321
00:24:04,585 --> 00:24:06,552
He sure did a beautiful job.

322
00:24:06,753 --> 00:24:09,085
Pink and gold
are my favorite colors.

323
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,257
This is our Gold Ballroom.

324
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:15,091
I'll say!

325
00:24:15,297 --> 00:24:19,063
We can accommodate up to
300 people here very comfortably.

326
00:24:19,602 --> 00:24:22,469
Boy, we could really have
a good party in this room.

327
00:24:22,672 --> 00:24:26,472
I'm afraid you won't do too well
here unless you brought supplies.

328
00:24:26,676 --> 00:24:29,737
We remove the booze from
the premises when we shut down.

329
00:24:29,947 --> 00:24:33,007
That reduces the insurance
we normally have to carry.

330
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:34,185
We don't drink.

331
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:35,820
Then you're in luck.

332
00:24:36,022 --> 00:24:40,254
Dick, come on over and say hello
to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.

333
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:42,587
This is Dick Hallorann,
our head chef.

334
00:24:42,796 --> 00:24:45,526
Mr. Hallorann, I'm Jack.
This is my wife, Winifred.

335
00:24:45,732 --> 00:24:46,926
Glad to meet you.

336
00:24:47,134 --> 00:24:50,001
The Torrances will take care
of the Overlook this winter.

337
00:24:50,204 --> 00:24:53,936
That's just great. How do you
folks like our hotel so far?

338
00:24:54,143 --> 00:24:56,008
It's just wonderful.

339
00:24:56,212 --> 00:24:57,736
Hi, Danny!

340
00:24:58,648 --> 00:25:01,344
I found him outside
looking for you.

341
00:25:02,552 --> 00:25:05,419
Did you get tired
of bombing the universe?

342
00:25:06,824 --> 00:25:08,314
Come on over here.

343
00:25:08,526 --> 00:25:09,686
Thank you, Susie.

344
00:25:09,894 --> 00:25:13,888
I think it'd be good if you could
show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen...

345
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,965
...while I continue on with Jack.

346
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:18,603
It would be a pleasure.
Right this way.

347
00:25:18,805 --> 00:25:20,363
Great. See you later, hon.

348
00:25:20,573 --> 00:25:21,939
Bye, darling.

349
00:25:24,311 --> 00:25:27,644
Mrs. Torrance, your husband
introduced you as Winifred.

350
00:25:27,848 --> 00:25:30,374
Now, are you a "Winnie",
or a "Freddie"?

351
00:25:30,585 --> 00:25:31,847
I'm a Wendy.

352
00:25:32,053 --> 00:25:35,250
Wendy. That's nice.
That's the prettiest.

353
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:37,085
This is the kitchen, huh?

354
00:25:37,294 --> 00:25:38,886
This is it.

355
00:25:39,096 --> 00:25:42,031
How do you like it, Danny?
ls it big enough for you?

356
00:25:42,866 --> 00:25:45,062
It's the biggest place I ever seen.

357
00:25:45,303 --> 00:25:47,635
This whole place
is such an enormous maze.

358
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:51,400
I'll have to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs every time I come in.

359
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,176
Don't let it get you down.

360
00:25:54,381 --> 00:25:56,871
It's big, but it ain't
nothing but a kitchen.

361
00:25:57,082 --> 00:25:59,277
A lot of this stuff
you'll never have to touch.

362
00:25:59,485 --> 00:26:01,716
I wouldn't know
what to do with it if I did.

363
00:26:01,921 --> 00:26:05,049
One thing for sure, you don't
have to worry about food.

364
00:26:05,258 --> 00:26:09,923
You folks could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice.

365
00:26:10,131 --> 00:26:13,225
Right here is
our walk-in freezer.

366
00:26:14,368 --> 00:26:17,429
This is where we keep
all of our meat.

367
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,631
You got 15 rib roasts...

368
00:26:19,842 --> 00:26:21,969
...30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.

369
00:26:22,178 --> 00:26:25,239
We got 12 turkeys,
about 40 chickens...

370
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:28,543
...50 sirloin steaks,
two dozen of pork roast...

371
00:26:28,752 --> 00:26:31,722
...and 20 legs of lamb.
Do you like lamb, Doc?

372
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:35,323
You don't?
What's your favorite food, then?

373
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:37,393
French fries and ketchup.

374
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,122
I think we can
manage that too, Doc.

375
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:42,063
Come along, now.
Watch your step.

376
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,368
How'd you know we call him Doc?

377
00:26:50,578 --> 00:26:54,605
-Beg your pardon?
-Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice.

378
00:26:54,816 --> 00:26:56,216
I did?

379
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,148
We call him Doc sometimes,
like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.

380
00:27:00,357 --> 00:27:01,619
But how did you know?

381
00:27:01,825 --> 00:27:04,351
I guess I probably
heard you call him that.

382
00:27:04,562 --> 00:27:06,826
It's possible.
But I honestly don't remember...

383
00:27:07,031 --> 00:27:09,226
...calling him that
since we've been with you.

384
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:11,629
Anyway, he looks
like a Doc, doesn't he?

385
00:27:13,071 --> 00:27:14,504
What's up, Doc?

386
00:27:16,342 --> 00:27:18,538
Now, this is the storeroom.

387
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,111
In here is where we keep...

388
00:27:22,316 --> 00:27:25,114
...all the dried goods
and the canned goods.

389
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:27,754
We got canned fruits
and vegetables...

390
00:27:27,956 --> 00:27:31,756
...canned fish and meats,
hot and cold cereals.

391
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,158
Post Toasties, Corn Flakes,
Sugar Puffs...

392
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:39,391
...Rice Krispies, oatmeal,
Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.

393
00:27:39,636 --> 00:27:42,071
You got a dozen jugs
of black molasses.

394
00:27:42,273 --> 00:27:45,469
We got 60 boxes of dried milk...

395
00:27:53,117 --> 00:27:55,585
How'd you like some ice cream, Doc?

396
00:27:57,991 --> 00:27:59,982
Sociables, finger rolls...

397
00:28:00,193 --> 00:28:01,717
...and 7 kinds of what have you.

398
00:28:01,928 --> 00:28:05,456
Now, we've got dried peaches,
dried apricots...

399
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:08,760
...dried raisins and dried prunes.

400
00:28:08,969 --> 00:28:13,270
You know, you got to keep regular
if you want to be happy.

401
00:28:16,178 --> 00:28:17,805
-How're you getting on?
-Fine.

402
00:28:18,014 --> 00:28:21,576
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We're on our way to the basement.

403
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,719
I promise we won't
keep her very long.

404
00:28:23,921 --> 00:28:27,118
No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just
getting to the ice cream.

405
00:28:27,324 --> 00:28:29,190
You like ice cream, Doc?

406
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:31,028
I thought you did.

407
00:28:31,229 --> 00:28:34,289
You folks mind if I give Danny
some ice cream while we wait?

408
00:28:34,499 --> 00:28:36,330
-Not at all.
-We don't mind.

409
00:28:36,535 --> 00:28:38,730
-Good.
-Sound good to you, Doc?

410
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:40,998
Okay, you behave yourself.

411
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,876
What kind of ice cream
do you like?

412
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,978
Chocolate.

413
00:28:47,181 --> 00:28:50,150
Chocolate it shall be.
Come on, son.

414
00:28:54,723 --> 00:28:56,714
It's amazing, all this
activity today.

415
00:28:56,925 --> 00:28:59,723
The guests and some staff
left yesterday, but the...

416
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,363
...last day's always hectic.

417
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:04,625
Everybody wants to be on their way
as early as possible.

418
00:29:04,835 --> 00:29:08,863
By 5:00 tonight, you'll never
know anybody was ever here.

419
00:29:09,074 --> 00:29:11,133
Just like a ghost ship, huh?

420
00:29:16,816 --> 00:29:19,785
Do you know how I knew
your name was Doc?

421
00:29:26,361 --> 00:29:28,761
You know what I'm
talking about, don't you?

422
00:29:35,737 --> 00:29:39,230
I can remember when I was
a little boy...

423
00:29:39,643 --> 00:29:42,168
...my grandmother and I
could hold conversations...

424
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:46,213
...entirely without ever
opening our mouths.

425
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,583
She called it "shining."

426
00:29:51,088 --> 00:29:53,818
And for a long time I thought
it was just the two of us...

427
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,654
...that had "the shine" to us.

428
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,254
Just like you probably thought
you was the only one.

429
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:02,800
But there are other folks...

430
00:30:03,003 --> 00:30:06,734
...though mostly they don't
know it, or don't believe it.

431
00:30:11,413 --> 00:30:13,847
How long have you
been able to do it?

432
00:30:19,055 --> 00:30:21,455
Why don't you want
to talk about it?

433
00:30:26,698 --> 00:30:28,757
I'm not supposed to.

434
00:30:30,335 --> 00:30:32,860
Who says you ain't supposed to?

435
00:30:36,308 --> 00:30:37,707
Tony.

436
00:30:39,678 --> 00:30:41,340
Who's Tony?

437
00:30:43,818 --> 00:30:47,219
Tony's the little boy
that lives in my mouth.

438
00:30:49,157 --> 00:30:51,182
Is Tony the one
that...

439
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:52,951
...tells you things?

440
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,866
How does he tell you things?

441
00:31:01,705 --> 00:31:06,006
It's like I go to sleep,
and he shows me things.

442
00:31:06,211 --> 00:31:10,307
But when I wake up,
I can't remember everything.

443
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:15,848
Does your mom and dad
know about Tony?

444
00:31:19,158 --> 00:31:21,719
Do they know he tells you things?

445
00:31:22,596 --> 00:31:25,531
Tony told me never to tell them.

446
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:31,036
Has Tony ever told you
anything about this place?

447
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:33,799
About the Overlook Hotel?

448
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,637
I don't know.

449
00:31:39,548 --> 00:31:42,346
Now think real hard, Doc.

450
00:31:42,552 --> 00:31:43,577
Think.

451
00:31:46,691 --> 00:31:49,421
Maybe he showed me something.

452
00:31:50,361 --> 00:31:52,990
Try to think of what it was.

453
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:59,301
Mr. Hallorann, are you scared
of this place?

454
00:32:02,408 --> 00:32:04,638
Scared of nothing here.

455
00:32:05,112 --> 00:32:06,602
It's just that...

456
00:32:07,348 --> 00:32:10,181
...you know, some places
are like people.

457
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:12,714
Some shine...

458
00:32:12,921 --> 00:32:14,320
...and some don't.

459
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,685
I guess you could say
the Overlook Hotel...

460
00:32:17,893 --> 00:32:21,192
...has something about it
that's like shining.

461
00:32:24,235 --> 00:32:26,635
Is there something bad here?

462
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:40,685
You know, Doc,
when something happens...

463
00:32:40,887 --> 00:32:44,516
...it can leave a trace
of itself behind.

464
00:32:45,292 --> 00:32:46,851
Say, like...

465
00:32:47,062 --> 00:32:50,122
...if someone burns toast.

466
00:32:52,234 --> 00:32:56,899
Maybe things that happen
leave other kind of traces behind.

467
00:32:58,074 --> 00:33:01,511
Not things that anyone
can notice.

468
00:33:01,712 --> 00:33:06,513
But things that people
who shine can see.

469
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:10,919
Just like they can see things
that haven't happened yet...

470
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:17,356
...sometimes they can see things
that happened a long time ago.

471
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:21,765
I think a lot of things
happened right here...

472
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:25,665
...in this particular hotel
over the years.

473
00:33:26,207 --> 00:33:28,607
And not all of them
was good.

474
00:33:31,913 --> 00:33:34,542
What about room 237?

475
00:33:37,886 --> 00:33:40,081
Room 237?

476
00:33:41,391 --> 00:33:44,485
You're scared of room 237,
ain't you?

477
00:33:46,263 --> 00:33:47,730
No, I ain't.

478
00:33:49,234 --> 00:33:53,068
Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237?

479
00:33:54,406 --> 00:33:55,771
Nothing.

480
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:59,440
There ain't nothing in room 237.

481
00:33:59,645 --> 00:34:02,876
But you ain't got no business
going in there anyway.

482
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,210
So stay out.

483
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:07,910
You understand? Stay out!

484
00:35:47,304 --> 00:35:49,033
Good morning, hon.

485
00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:52,805
Your breakfast is ready.

486
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:55,206
What time is it?

487
00:35:55,414 --> 00:35:57,279
It's about 11:30.

488
00:35:59,185 --> 00:36:00,778
Jesus.

489
00:36:01,722 --> 00:36:04,156
I guess we've been
staying up too late.

490
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:05,891
I know it.

491
00:36:07,194 --> 00:36:10,062
I made them just the way
you like them, sunny-side up.

492
00:36:10,366 --> 00:36:11,924
Nice.

493
00:36:14,203 --> 00:36:16,000
It's really pretty outside.

494
00:36:16,205 --> 00:36:19,437
How about taking me for a walk
after you finish your breakfast?

495
00:36:20,043 --> 00:36:24,378
I suppose I ought to try
to do some writing first.

496
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,477
Any ideas yet?

497
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,147
Lots of ideas.

498
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,879
No good ones.

499
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:34,826
Something will come.

500
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:39,264
It's just a matter of settling into
the habit of writing every day.

501
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:42,529
That's all it is.

502
00:36:44,638 --> 00:36:46,936
It's really nice up here,
isn't it?

503
00:36:47,341 --> 00:36:48,775
I love it.

504
00:36:49,277 --> 00:36:50,868
I really do.

505
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,806
I've never been this happy
or comfortable anywhere.

506
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:58,783
It's amazing how fast you get
used to such a big place.

507
00:36:58,988 --> 00:37:01,889
I tell you, when we first
came up here...

508
00:37:02,091 --> 00:37:04,151
...I thought it was kind of scary.

509
00:37:04,594 --> 00:37:07,154
I fell in love with it right away.

510
00:37:07,831 --> 00:37:10,629
When I came up here
for my interview...

511
00:37:11,003 --> 00:37:14,837
...it was as though
I'd been here before.

512
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,668
I mean, we all have moments
of deja vu...

513
00:37:17,876 --> 00:37:20,072
...but this was ridiculous.

514
00:37:20,814 --> 00:37:22,679
It was almost as though I knew...

515
00:37:22,882 --> 00:37:26,614
...what was going to be
around every corner.

516
00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:02,956
The loser has to keep
America clean. How's that?

517
00:38:03,163 --> 00:38:05,724
-All right.
-And you're going to lose.

518
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:09,061
And I'm going to get you.
You'd better run fast!

519
00:38:14,077 --> 00:38:15,203
Look out!

520
00:38:15,411 --> 00:38:17,276
I'm coming in close.

521
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,971
Loser has to keep America clean.

522
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:21,844
Keep America clean.

523
00:38:22,853 --> 00:38:24,320
Danny, you win.

524
00:38:24,655 --> 00:38:26,987
Let's take the rest
of this walking.

525
00:38:29,528 --> 00:38:30,927
Give me your hand.

526
00:38:33,566 --> 00:38:35,363
Isn't it beautiful?

527
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,487
Dead end.

528
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,583
We made it.

529
00:39:54,093 --> 00:39:55,322
Isn't it beautiful?

530
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,852
It's so pretty.

531
00:40:23,427 --> 00:40:26,397
I didn't think it was
going to be this big. Did you?

532
00:40:37,677 --> 00:40:40,077
Rutherford was serving
a life sentence...

533
00:40:40,279 --> 00:40:42,043
...for a 1968 shooting.

534
00:40:42,249 --> 00:40:46,117
And the search continues
for that missing Aspen woman.

535
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,688
24-year-old Susan Robertson
has been missing 10 days.

536
00:40:49,891 --> 00:40:52,621
She disappeared on a hunting
trip with her husband.

537
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:55,625
They may have to
call off the search...

538
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:58,357
...if a predicted snowstorm
moves in tomorrow.

539
00:40:58,568 --> 00:41:00,433
It's so beautiful
in Denver today...

540
00:41:00,637 --> 00:41:02,764
...it's hard to believe
a snowstorm could be close.

541
00:41:02,972 --> 00:41:05,203
I want to go outside
and lie in the sun...

542
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:09,539
...yet to our north, to our west,
it is snowing and cold.

543
00:41:09,747 --> 00:41:10,941
And it's moving...

544
00:41:11,148 --> 00:41:14,312
...right here towards Colorado
as we talk. It's incredible.

545
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,393
Hi, hon.

546
00:43:47,999 --> 00:43:49,399
How's it going?

547
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:53,130
Fine.

548
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,799
Get a lot written today?

549
00:44:03,851 --> 00:44:06,411
The weather forecast
said it's going to snow tonight.

550
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:13,958
What do you want me
to do about it?

551
00:44:16,097 --> 00:44:18,258
Come on, hon.

552
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,626
Don't be so grouchy.

553
00:44:21,038 --> 00:44:22,369
I'm not...

554
00:44:22,739 --> 00:44:23,933
...being grouchy.

555
00:44:24,141 --> 00:44:26,939
I just want to finish my work.

556
00:44:30,448 --> 00:44:32,848
Okay. I understand.

557
00:44:33,084 --> 00:44:35,679
I'll come back later
with a couple of sandwiches.

558
00:44:35,888 --> 00:44:38,356
Maybe you'll let me
read something then.

559
00:44:41,561 --> 00:44:42,653
Wendy...

560
00:44:42,862 --> 00:44:45,457
...let me explain something to you.

561
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:50,235
When you come in and interrupt,
you're breaking my concentration.

562
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:51,872
You're distracting me...

563
00:44:52,074 --> 00:44:55,510
...and it will then take me time
to get back to where I was.

564
00:44:55,711 --> 00:44:57,144
Understand?

565
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:01,777
Fine.

566
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:04,682
We're going to make a new rule:

567
00:45:04,888 --> 00:45:06,321
Whenever I'm in here...

568
00:45:06,524 --> 00:45:08,788
...and you hear me typing...

569
00:45:10,595 --> 00:45:13,530
...or whatever the fuck
you hear me doing in here...

570
00:45:13,732 --> 00:45:16,031
...when I'm in here,
that means I am working.

571
00:45:16,235 --> 00:45:18,465
That means don't come in.

572
00:45:18,671 --> 00:45:20,935
Now, do you think
you can handle that?

573
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:26,706
Fine.

574
00:45:27,749 --> 00:45:31,049
Why don't you start right now
and get the fuck out of here?

575
00:46:06,994 --> 00:46:08,359
All right, you!

576
00:46:09,798 --> 00:46:11,595
I know you've got more.

577
00:46:13,702 --> 00:46:14,760
Missed!

578
00:46:20,342 --> 00:46:21,172
Don't have!

579
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:23,139
No fair anymore.

580
00:47:31,826 --> 00:47:33,123
I knew it.

581
00:48:03,395 --> 00:48:06,888
This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1.

582
00:48:09,403 --> 00:48:13,100
KDK 12 to KDK 1.

583
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:16,436
This is KDK 1.
We're receiving you. Over.

584
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:19,939
Hi, this is Wendy Torrance
at the Overlook Hotel.

585
00:48:20,515 --> 00:48:23,314
Hi, how are you folks
getting on up there? Over.

586
00:48:23,586 --> 00:48:24,917
We're just fine.

587
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,588
But our telephones
aren't doing too well.

588
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:30,818
Are the lines down,
by any chance? Over.

589
00:48:31,462 --> 00:48:35,262
Yes, quite a few of them are down
due to the storm. Over.

590
00:48:35,566 --> 00:48:38,764
Any chance of them
being repaired soon? Over.

591
00:48:38,971 --> 00:48:40,131
Well, I wouldn't like to say.

592
00:48:40,339 --> 00:48:43,775
Most winters they stay that way
until spring. Over.

593
00:48:44,276 --> 00:48:47,678
Boy, this storm is really something,
isn't it? Over.

594
00:48:48,148 --> 00:48:51,049
Yes. It's one of the worst we've
had for years.

595
00:48:51,619 --> 00:48:54,817
Is there anything else we can
do for you, Mrs. Torrance?

596
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:57,451
I suppose not. Over.

597
00:48:58,059 --> 00:49:01,359
If you folks have any problems
up there, just give us a call.

598
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:02,861
And, Mrs. Torrance?

599
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:07,263
It might be a good idea if you
leave your radio on all the time.

600
00:49:08,106 --> 00:49:09,596
Okay. We'll do that.

601
00:49:09,807 --> 00:49:11,866
It was real nice talking to you.

602
00:49:12,076 --> 00:49:14,704
Bye. Over and out.

603
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,815
Hello, Danny.

604
00:49:57,095 --> 00:49:59,529
Come and play with us.

605
00:50:04,403 --> 00:50:07,167
Come and play with us, Danny.

606
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:10,875
Forever...

607
00:50:12,647 --> 00:50:14,410
...and ever...

608
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:17,375
...and ever.

609
00:50:48,855 --> 00:50:50,483
Tony...

610
00:50:51,493 --> 00:50:53,518
...I'm scared.

611
00:50:59,001 --> 00:51:02,562
Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.

612
00:51:04,173 --> 00:51:08,076
It's just like
pictures in a book, Danny.

613
00:51:08,278 --> 00:51:10,439
It isn't real.

614
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:22,940
Please let me give you
some money.

615
00:51:23,144 --> 00:51:25,169
I wouldn't think of it.

616
00:51:25,413 --> 00:51:26,675
Well, how can I repay you?

617
00:51:27,649 --> 00:51:29,550
It's okay. Really.

618
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:32,280
Well, I'm going to have
some coffee.

619
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,013
Would you like some?

620
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:36,818
Sure.

621
00:51:37,028 --> 00:51:38,893
Great. Sit down.

622
00:51:48,807 --> 00:51:51,435
Marvelous doughnuts.
Help yourself.

623
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,514
Coffee will be ready
in a few minutes.

624
00:51:59,286 --> 00:52:02,620
Can I go up to my room
and get my fire engine?

625
00:52:04,059 --> 00:52:06,789
Not right now.
Daddy's asleep.

626
00:52:07,764 --> 00:52:09,925
I won't make any noise.

627
00:52:11,335 --> 00:52:13,235
Now come on, Doc.

628
00:52:13,437 --> 00:52:15,132
He only went to bed
a few hours ago.

629
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,137
Can't you wait till later?

630
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:20,470
I won't make a sound.
I promise I'll tiptoe.

631
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:24,979
All right.

632
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:27,584
But really don't make a sound.

633
00:52:27,787 --> 00:52:29,277
I won't, Mom.

634
00:52:30,089 --> 00:52:31,819
Make sure you
come right back...

635
00:52:32,026 --> 00:52:34,017
...because I'm going to
make lunch soon.

636
00:52:36,164 --> 00:52:37,654
Okay, Mom.

637
00:53:26,922 --> 00:53:30,085
Can I go to my room
and get my fire engine?

638
00:53:33,831 --> 00:53:36,026
Come here for a minute first.

639
00:54:13,043 --> 00:54:14,840
How's it going, Doc?

640
00:54:19,417 --> 00:54:21,215
Having a good time?

641
00:54:23,289 --> 00:54:24,756
Yes, Dad.

642
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:28,889
Good.

643
00:54:31,097 --> 00:54:33,258
I want you to
have a good time.

644
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:35,595
I am, Dad.

645
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:47,846
Do you feel bad?

646
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,089
I'm just a little bit tired.

647
00:54:57,662 --> 00:55:00,222
Then why don't you
go to sleep?

648
00:55:03,802 --> 00:55:05,360
I can't.

649
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:09,137
I got too much to do.

650
00:55:18,453 --> 00:55:20,717
Do you like this hotel?

651
00:55:26,729 --> 00:55:28,128
I do.

652
00:55:29,098 --> 00:55:30,430
I love it.

653
00:55:32,636 --> 00:55:33,967
Don't you?

654
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,830
I guess so.

655
00:55:40,479 --> 00:55:41,673
Good.

656
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,216
I want you to like it here.

657
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:54,592
I wish we could stay here
forever...

658
00:55:54,795 --> 00:55:56,592
...and ever...

659
00:55:57,265 --> 00:55:58,596
...and ever.

660
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,064
What?

661
00:56:06,342 --> 00:56:09,437
You would never hurt Mommy or me,
would you?

662
00:56:14,918 --> 00:56:16,408
What do you mean?

663
00:56:21,527 --> 00:56:24,121
Did your mother ever
say that to you?

664
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,595
That I would hurt you?

665
00:56:27,367 --> 00:56:28,732
No, Dad.

666
00:56:30,904 --> 00:56:32,463
You sure?

667
00:56:33,007 --> 00:56:34,565
Yes, Dad.

668
00:56:39,381 --> 00:56:41,407
I love you, Danny.

669
00:56:42,618 --> 00:56:45,212
I love you
more than anything else...

670
00:56:45,421 --> 00:56:47,981
...in the whole world...

671
00:56:48,759 --> 00:56:51,818
...and I would never do anything
to hurt you...

672
00:56:52,128 --> 00:56:53,356
...never.

673
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:56,290
You know that, don't you?

674
00:56:56,767 --> 00:56:58,325
Yes, Dad.

675
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:00,362
Good.

676
00:58:28,308 --> 00:58:30,072
Mom, are you in there?

677
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:50,394
What happened?

678
00:59:50,604 --> 00:59:51,832
Honey...

679
00:59:52,706 --> 00:59:54,105
...what's wrong?

680
01:00:02,284 --> 01:00:03,684
I had the most...

681
01:00:03,887 --> 01:00:06,481
...terrible nightmare I ever had.

682
01:00:08,425 --> 01:00:11,361
-It was the most horrible dream.
-It's okay, it's okay now.

683
01:00:12,563 --> 01:00:13,928
Really.

684
01:00:18,202 --> 01:00:19,795
I dreamed that l...

685
01:00:20,005 --> 01:00:22,439
...that I killed
you and Danny.

686
01:00:25,178 --> 01:00:27,408
But I didn't just kill you.

687
01:00:28,715 --> 01:00:31,479
I cut you up
into little pieces.

688
01:00:34,154 --> 01:00:35,678
My God.

689
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:38,950
I must be losing my mind.

690
01:00:41,228 --> 01:00:43,857
Everything's going to be
all right.

691
01:00:45,968 --> 01:00:48,664
Come on. Let's get up
off the floor.

692
01:00:56,513 --> 01:00:58,812
There. Now sit up.

693
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:00,747
It's okay.

694
01:01:01,853 --> 01:01:03,286
It's okay.

695
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,554
Danny!

696
01:01:08,862 --> 01:01:10,796
Everything's okay!

697
01:01:10,997 --> 01:01:14,161
Just go play in your room
for a while.

698
01:01:14,502 --> 01:01:16,561
Your dad's just got
a headache.

699
01:01:17,872 --> 01:01:20,899
Danny, mind what I say.
Go play in your room.

700
01:01:22,878 --> 01:01:25,813
Honey, let me just go
get him out of here.

701
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,539
I'll be right back.

702
01:01:29,453 --> 01:01:31,512
Why don't you mind me?

703
01:01:38,129 --> 01:01:39,960
Oh, my God.

704
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:43,566
What happened to your neck?

705
01:01:45,505 --> 01:01:47,632
What happened to your neck?

706
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:18,575
You did this to him...

707
01:02:19,009 --> 01:02:20,442
...didn't you?!

708
01:02:22,279 --> 01:02:24,339
You son of a bitch!

709
01:02:24,549 --> 01:02:26,414
You did this to him!

710
01:02:26,619 --> 01:02:28,052
Didn't you?!

711
01:02:29,388 --> 01:02:31,050
How could you?!

712
01:02:31,291 --> 01:02:33,020
How could you?!

713
01:04:02,898 --> 01:04:05,992
God! I'd give anything
for a drink.

714
01:04:08,638 --> 01:04:11,539
I'd give my goddamn soul...

715
01:04:11,741 --> 01:04:14,233
...for just a glass of beer.

716
01:04:29,229 --> 01:04:30,719
Hi, Lloyd.

717
01:04:34,268 --> 01:04:36,669
A little slow tonight,
isn't it?

718
01:04:41,542 --> 01:04:43,807
Yes it is, Mr. Torrance.

719
01:04:45,881 --> 01:04:47,348
What will it be?

720
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:51,989
I'm awfully glad
you asked me that, Lloyd...

721
01:04:52,189 --> 01:04:55,522
...because I just happen to have
two twenties...

722
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:58,627
...and two tens
right here in my wallet.

723
01:04:58,829 --> 01:05:02,095
I was afraid they were
going to be there until next April.

724
01:05:02,801 --> 01:05:04,632
So here's what:

725
01:05:04,937 --> 01:05:07,236
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...

726
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,238
...a little glass and some ice.

727
01:05:10,444 --> 01:05:12,469
You can do that,
can't you, Lloyd?

728
01:05:12,913 --> 01:05:15,280
You're not too busy, are you?

729
01:05:15,850 --> 01:05:18,341
No, sir.
I'm not busy at all.

730
01:05:18,853 --> 01:05:20,411
Good man.

731
01:05:20,722 --> 01:05:21,814
You set them up...

732
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:24,958
...and I'll knock them back,
one by one.

733
01:05:26,095 --> 01:05:29,030
White man's burden,
Lloyd, my man.

734
01:05:29,231 --> 01:05:31,393
White man's burden.

735
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:38,602
Say, Lloyd...

736
01:05:38,811 --> 01:05:41,575
...it seems I'm temporarily light.

737
01:05:41,914 --> 01:05:44,348
How's my credit
in this joint, anyway?

738
01:05:44,616 --> 01:05:46,983
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.

739
01:05:47,687 --> 01:05:49,314
That's swell.

740
01:05:49,522 --> 01:05:51,217
I like you, Lloyd.

741
01:05:51,425 --> 01:05:53,086
I always liked you.

742
01:05:53,294 --> 01:05:55,626
You were always the best of them.

743
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:58,196
Best goddamned bartender...

744
01:05:58,399 --> 01:06:01,334
...from Timbuktu
to Portland, Maine.

745
01:06:01,536 --> 01:06:03,766
Or Portland, Oregon,
for that matter.

746
01:06:04,039 --> 01:06:05,836
Thank you for saying so.

747
01:06:08,143 --> 01:06:12,672
Here's to 5 miserable months
on the wagon...

748
01:06:12,883 --> 01:06:16,944
...and all the irreparable harm
that it's caused me.

749
01:06:35,176 --> 01:06:37,644
How are things going,
Mr. Torrance?

750
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:41,575
Things could be better.

751
01:06:43,085 --> 01:06:45,849
Things could be
a whole lot better.

752
01:06:46,722 --> 01:06:49,055
I hope it's nothing serious.

753
01:06:52,063 --> 01:06:54,054
Nothing serious.

754
01:06:55,699 --> 01:06:58,260
Just a little problem with...

755
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:01,598
...the old sperm bank
upstairs.

756
01:07:01,807 --> 01:07:04,174
Nothing I can't handle,
though.

757
01:07:04,377 --> 01:07:06,072
Thanks.

758
01:07:06,546 --> 01:07:07,535
Women.

759
01:07:07,747 --> 01:07:09,271
Can't live with them...

760
01:07:09,482 --> 01:07:11,313
...can't live without them.

761
01:07:14,522 --> 01:07:16,080
Words of wisdom, Lloyd.

762
01:07:16,291 --> 01:07:17,758
Words of...

763
01:07:17,959 --> 01:07:19,484
...wisdom.

764
01:07:31,007 --> 01:07:34,238
I never laid a hand on him,
goddamn it.

765
01:07:34,445 --> 01:07:36,073
I didn't.

766
01:07:38,117 --> 01:07:42,713
I wouldn't touch one hair
on his goddamn little head.

767
01:07:43,322 --> 01:07:46,450
I love the little
son of a bitch.

768
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:50,894
I'd do anything for him.

769
01:07:51,097 --> 01:07:53,895
Any fucking thing for him.

770
01:07:57,972 --> 01:08:00,533
But that bitch!

771
01:08:01,543 --> 01:08:03,238
As long as I live...

772
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:06,914
...she'll never let me forget
what happened.

773
01:08:16,528 --> 01:08:19,361
I did hurt him once, okay?

774
01:08:19,731 --> 01:08:21,791
It was an accident.

775
01:08:22,101 --> 01:08:24,695
Completely unintentional.

776
01:08:25,971 --> 01:08:28,201
It could have happened
to anybody.

777
01:08:29,943 --> 01:08:33,401
And it was three goddamn
years ago!

778
01:08:33,613 --> 01:08:36,446
The little fucker had thrown all my
papers all over the floor.

779
01:08:36,651 --> 01:08:39,120
All I tried to do was pull him up.

780
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:46,590
A momentary loss of
muscular coordination.

781
01:08:46,896 --> 01:08:48,124
I mean...

782
01:08:48,665 --> 01:08:52,192
...a few extra foot-pounds
of energy...

783
01:08:52,402 --> 01:08:55,236
...per second, per second.

784
01:09:11,358 --> 01:09:13,258
Thank God you're here.

785
01:09:16,498 --> 01:09:18,693
There's someone else
in the hotel with us.

786
01:09:18,901 --> 01:09:21,426
There's a crazy woman
in one of the rooms.

787
01:09:21,637 --> 01:09:24,198
She tried to strangle Danny.

788
01:09:26,743 --> 01:09:29,143
Are you out of your fucking mind?

789
01:09:31,081 --> 01:09:33,106
It's the truth! Really.

790
01:09:33,316 --> 01:09:35,307
I swear it.
Danny told me.

791
01:09:35,653 --> 01:09:37,518
He went up into
one of the bedrooms.

792
01:09:37,722 --> 01:09:41,181
The door was open, and he saw this
crazy woman in the bathtub.

793
01:09:41,393 --> 01:09:43,725
She tried to strangle him!

794
01:09:47,432 --> 01:09:49,196
Which room was it?

795
01:09:56,845 --> 01:09:58,972
From Channel 10 in Miami...

796
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:01,546
...this is Newswatch
with Glen Rinker...

797
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:05,949
...Ann Bishop, and
the award-winning Newswatch team.

798
01:10:06,289 --> 01:10:08,723
Good evening. I'm Glen Rinker,
Newswatch Ten.

799
01:10:08,924 --> 01:10:12,053
As Miami continues to swelter
in a record winter heat wave...

800
01:10:12,262 --> 01:10:14,389
...bringing temperatures
to the 90s...

801
01:10:14,598 --> 01:10:17,726
...Central and Mountain states
are buried in snow.

802
01:10:17,935 --> 01:10:21,929
In Colorado, 10 inches of snow
fell injust a few hours tonight.

803
01:10:22,141 --> 01:10:24,371
Travel in the Rockies
is almost impossible.

804
01:10:24,576 --> 01:10:27,546
Airports are shut down, stranding
thousands of passengers.

805
01:10:27,747 --> 01:10:29,647
Highways are blocked
by snowdrifts.

806
01:10:29,849 --> 01:10:31,612
Railroad tracks are frozen.

807
01:10:31,818 --> 01:10:33,843
Officials in Colorado
tell Newswatch...

808
01:10:34,054 --> 01:10:37,616
...at least 3 have been killed
by exposure to freezing winds.

809
01:10:37,826 --> 01:10:40,124
The governor of Colorado
is expected...

810
01:10:40,329 --> 01:10:42,058
...to declare
a weather emergency.

811
01:10:42,265 --> 01:10:44,096
The National Guard
might be called out...

812
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:45,494
...to clear streets and roads.

813
01:10:45,702 --> 01:10:47,932
Weather forecasters
predict more snow...

814
01:10:48,137 --> 01:10:50,129
...and heavy winds
tonight and tomorrow...

815
01:10:50,341 --> 01:10:52,969
...with temperatures dropping
well below zero.

816
01:10:53,177 --> 01:10:56,169
Back here in Florida,
we've got the opposite problem.

817
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:58,611
The heat and humidity
are supposed to climb.

818
01:10:58,818 --> 01:11:00,786
Local beaches
should bejammed.

819
01:11:00,986 --> 01:11:03,011
Our weather expert,
Walter Cronice...

820
01:11:03,222 --> 01:11:06,488
...will have the local forecast
later on Newswatch.

821
01:16:38,179 --> 01:16:42,810
We're sorry. Your call cannot
be completed as dialed.

822
01:16:43,152 --> 01:16:46,280
If you need assistance,
please call the operator.

823
01:17:03,541 --> 01:17:05,373
Yes, it's me.

824
01:17:05,577 --> 01:17:07,010
Thank God.

825
01:17:11,684 --> 01:17:13,448
Did you find anything?

826
01:17:13,654 --> 01:17:16,384
No. Nothing at all.

827
01:17:16,991 --> 01:17:20,155
I didn't see one goddamn thing.

828
01:17:22,898 --> 01:17:26,390
You went into the room Danny said?
To 237?

829
01:17:26,602 --> 01:17:28,161
Yes, I did.

830
01:17:28,639 --> 01:17:30,436
And you didn't see anything at all?

831
01:17:30,641 --> 01:17:32,632
Absolutely nothing.

832
01:17:32,843 --> 01:17:34,105
How is he?

833
01:17:34,311 --> 01:17:36,109
He's still asleep.

834
01:17:36,514 --> 01:17:37,640
Good.

835
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:46,549
I'm sure he'll be himself again
in the morning.

836
01:17:51,032 --> 01:17:53,523
Are you sure it was the right room?

837
01:17:53,734 --> 01:17:56,897
I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake.

838
01:17:57,104 --> 01:17:59,471
He must have gone in that room.

839
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:02,337
The door was open,
the lights were on.

840
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:07,313
I just don't understand it.

841
01:18:11,655 --> 01:18:14,682
What about those bruises
on his neck?

842
01:18:16,862 --> 01:18:19,194
Somebody did that to him.

843
01:18:27,473 --> 01:18:28,906
I think...

844
01:18:30,578 --> 01:18:33,138
...he did it to himself.

845
01:18:39,153 --> 01:18:40,381
No.

846
01:18:41,055 --> 01:18:43,080
That's not possible.

847
01:18:48,398 --> 01:18:52,061
Once you rule out his version
of what happened...

848
01:18:52,302 --> 01:18:54,897
...there is no other explanation.

849
01:18:55,373 --> 01:18:56,704
Is there?

850
01:18:59,076 --> 01:19:01,978
It wouldn't be that different
from the episode...

851
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:05,547
...that he had before
we came up here.

852
01:19:05,751 --> 01:19:06,979
Would it?

853
01:19:14,895 --> 01:19:17,888
Whatever the explanation is...

854
01:19:21,336 --> 01:19:22,735
...I think we...

855
01:19:22,938 --> 01:19:25,669
...have to get Danny out of here.

856
01:19:30,447 --> 01:19:32,279
Get him out of here?

857
01:19:36,454 --> 01:19:38,183
You mean...

858
01:19:39,223 --> 01:19:41,192
...just leave the hotel?

859
01:19:50,171 --> 01:19:51,638
It is so...

860
01:19:51,839 --> 01:19:54,273
...typical of you to create
a problem like this...

861
01:19:54,475 --> 01:19:57,001
...when I finally have a chance
to accomplish something!

862
01:19:57,212 --> 01:19:59,772
When I'm really into my work!

863
01:19:59,982 --> 01:20:03,942
I could really write my own ticket
if I went back now, couldn't I?

864
01:20:04,153 --> 01:20:07,884
Shoveling out driveways,
work in a car wash.

865
01:20:08,091 --> 01:20:10,184
Any of that appeal to you?

866
01:20:11,396 --> 01:20:14,092
I have let you fuck up my life
so far...

867
01:20:14,299 --> 01:20:17,928
...but I am not going to let you
fuck this up.

868
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:38,159
Good evening. Forest Service.

869
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:40,163
My name is Dick Hallorann.

870
01:21:40,365 --> 01:21:42,799
I'm the head chef at
the Overlook Hotel.

871
01:21:43,001 --> 01:21:45,129
Good evening.
What can I do for you?

872
01:21:45,338 --> 01:21:48,899
I've been trying to make
an urgent phone call up there...

873
01:21:49,109 --> 01:21:52,408
...but the operator said
that the phone lines are down.

874
01:21:52,614 --> 01:21:56,209
A lot of lines around here
are down due to the storm.

875
01:21:56,418 --> 01:21:59,080
I hate to put you through
any trouble...

876
01:21:59,287 --> 01:22:02,519
...but there's a family up there
all by themselves with a young kid.

877
01:22:02,725 --> 01:22:04,386
And with this storm
and everything...

878
01:22:04,594 --> 01:22:07,495
...I'd appreciate it if you'd give
them a call on your radio...

879
01:22:07,697 --> 01:22:09,689
...just to see if
everything's okay.

880
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:11,497
I'll be glad to do that.

881
01:22:11,702 --> 01:22:14,500
Why don't you call me back
in about 20 minutes?

882
01:22:14,706 --> 01:22:16,731
Thank you very much.
I'll do that.

883
01:22:16,941 --> 01:22:18,374
All right, sir.

884
01:22:38,699 --> 01:22:40,668
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

885
01:22:40,869 --> 01:22:42,336
Good evening.

886
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:08,366
Hi, Lloyd.

887
01:23:08,568 --> 01:23:10,433
Been away, but now I'm back.

888
01:23:10,704 --> 01:23:12,433
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

889
01:23:13,106 --> 01:23:14,095
It's good to see you.

890
01:23:14,308 --> 01:23:16,970
It's good to be back, Lloyd.

891
01:23:17,612 --> 01:23:19,342
What'll it be, sir?

892
01:23:20,149 --> 01:23:22,413
Hair of the dog that bit me.

893
01:23:23,819 --> 01:23:25,480
Bourbon on the rocks.

894
01:23:26,323 --> 01:23:27,722
That'll do her.

895
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:43,505
No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.

896
01:23:44,944 --> 01:23:46,912
No charge?

897
01:23:47,547 --> 01:23:49,539
Your money's no good here.

898
01:23:55,189 --> 01:23:56,918
Orders from the house.

899
01:24:00,129 --> 01:24:02,620
Orders from the house.

900
01:24:05,868 --> 01:24:07,859
Drink up, Mr. Torrance.

901
01:24:10,072 --> 01:24:14,601
I'm the kind of man likes to know
who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.

902
01:24:16,914 --> 01:24:19,849
It's not a matter that concerns you,
Mr. Torrance.

903
01:24:20,051 --> 01:24:21,986
At least, not at this point.

904
01:24:26,792 --> 01:24:29,193
Anything you say, Lloyd.

905
01:24:29,629 --> 01:24:31,620
Anything you say.

906
01:24:44,614 --> 01:24:47,082
Oh, dear! I'm so sorry, sir.

907
01:24:48,184 --> 01:24:49,651
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

908
01:24:49,852 --> 01:24:52,413
I've made an awful mess
of your jacket, sir.

909
01:24:53,657 --> 01:24:57,286
That's all right.
I've got plenty of jackets.

910
01:24:57,495 --> 01:25:00,294
I'm afraid it's advocaat, sir.
It tends to stain.

911
01:25:00,499 --> 01:25:01,625
Advocaat, is it?

912
01:25:01,834 --> 01:25:03,995
Yes, sir.
I think the best thing...

913
01:25:04,203 --> 01:25:06,398
...is to come along
to the gentlemen's room...

914
01:25:06,605 --> 01:25:09,131
...and we'll get
some water to it, sir.

915
01:25:09,976 --> 01:25:13,275
Looks like you might have got a
spot of it on yourself...

916
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:14,469
...Jeevesy old boy.

917
01:25:14,681 --> 01:25:17,845
That doesn't matter, sir.
You're the important one.

918
01:25:18,153 --> 01:25:20,553
Awfully nice of you to say.

919
01:25:20,989 --> 01:25:23,857
Of course, I intended to change
my jacket this evening...

920
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:26,324
...before the fish and
goose soiree.

921
01:25:26,529 --> 01:25:28,554
Very wise, sir. Very wise.

922
01:25:28,765 --> 01:25:30,096
Here. I'll just...

923
01:25:30,901 --> 01:25:33,165
...hold this for you there,
Jeevesy.

924
01:25:33,371 --> 01:25:35,168
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

925
01:25:36,207 --> 01:25:39,837
Let's see if we can improve this
with a little water, sir.

926
01:25:40,046 --> 01:25:41,308
All right. I'll just...

927
01:25:41,514 --> 01:25:45,712
...set my bourbon and advocaat
down right there.

928
01:25:46,285 --> 01:25:47,719
Won't keep you a moment.

929
01:25:47,921 --> 01:25:49,320
Fine.

930
01:25:52,393 --> 01:25:54,053
What do they call you,
Jeevesy?

931
01:25:54,261 --> 01:25:56,821
Grady, sir. Delbert Grady.

932
01:26:01,603 --> 01:26:02,434
Grady?

933
01:26:02,638 --> 01:26:03,969
Yes, sir.

934
01:26:05,141 --> 01:26:06,472
Delbert Grady.

935
01:26:06,675 --> 01:26:08,199
That's right, sir.

936
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,354
Mr. Grady...

937
01:26:19,124 --> 01:26:21,217
...haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

938
01:26:21,427 --> 01:26:24,123
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

939
01:26:31,171 --> 01:26:33,002
It's coming off now, sir.

940
01:26:37,945 --> 01:26:39,503
Mr. Grady...

941
01:26:41,017 --> 01:26:43,485
...weren't you once
the caretaker here?

942
01:26:43,686 --> 01:26:46,484
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

943
01:26:49,526 --> 01:26:52,859
You a married man, are you,
Mr. Grady?

944
01:26:53,063 --> 01:26:53,893
Yes, sir.

945
01:26:54,097 --> 01:26:57,363
I have a wife and
two daughters, sir.

946
01:26:58,403 --> 01:26:59,927
And...

947
01:27:01,607 --> 01:27:02,869
...where are they now?

948
01:27:03,075 --> 01:27:07,137
They're somewhere around.
I'm not quite sure at the moment.

949
01:27:17,825 --> 01:27:20,226
You were the caretaker here.

950
01:27:21,698 --> 01:27:23,689
I recognize you.

951
01:27:25,068 --> 01:27:28,129
I saw your picture
in the newspapers.

952
01:27:28,572 --> 01:27:30,335
You...

953
01:27:30,808 --> 01:27:34,335
...chopped your wife and daughter
up into little bits.

954
01:27:34,845 --> 01:27:36,245
And...

955
01:27:36,882 --> 01:27:38,816
...then you blew your brains out.

956
01:27:48,728 --> 01:27:50,491
That's strange, sir.

957
01:27:51,498 --> 01:27:54,228
I don't have any recollection
of that at all.

958
01:27:57,905 --> 01:27:59,771
Mr. Grady...

959
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:03,541
...you were the caretaker here.

960
01:28:11,354 --> 01:28:14,118
I'm sorry to differ with you, sir.

961
01:28:15,993 --> 01:28:17,722
But you...

962
01:28:18,462 --> 01:28:20,293
...are the caretaker.

963
01:28:22,569 --> 01:28:25,470
You've always been the caretaker.

964
01:28:28,374 --> 01:28:30,206
I should know, sir.

965
01:28:31,645 --> 01:28:34,239
I've always been here.

966
01:28:52,469 --> 01:28:54,665
Did you know, Mr. Torrance...

967
01:28:54,906 --> 01:28:56,669
...that your son...

968
01:28:57,075 --> 01:28:59,771
...is attempting to bring
an outside party...

969
01:28:59,978 --> 01:29:02,174
...into this situation?

970
01:29:04,751 --> 01:29:06,446
Did you know that?

971
01:29:12,693 --> 01:29:14,786
He is, Mr. Torrance.

972
01:29:17,132 --> 01:29:18,292
Who?

973
01:29:20,535 --> 01:29:22,162
A nigger.

974
01:29:26,243 --> 01:29:27,642
A nigger?

975
01:29:30,381 --> 01:29:31,813
A nigger...

976
01:29:32,015 --> 01:29:33,108
...cook.

977
01:29:39,623 --> 01:29:40,886
How?

978
01:29:43,161 --> 01:29:44,924
Your son...

979
01:29:45,364 --> 01:29:48,163
...has a very great talent.

980
01:29:49,136 --> 01:29:52,628
I don't think you are aware
how great it is.

981
01:29:53,373 --> 01:29:56,605
But he is attempting to use
that very talent...

982
01:29:56,811 --> 01:29:58,779
...against your will.

983
01:30:07,323 --> 01:30:08,585
Well...

984
01:30:11,361 --> 01:30:14,422
...he is a very willful boy.

985
01:30:16,834 --> 01:30:19,235
Indeed he is, Mr. Torrance.

986
01:30:19,438 --> 01:30:22,339
A very willful boy.

987
01:30:22,541 --> 01:30:23,872
A rather...

988
01:30:24,076 --> 01:30:25,600
...naughty boy...

989
01:30:25,812 --> 01:30:29,010
...if I may be so bold, sir.

990
01:30:36,257 --> 01:30:38,020
It's his mother.

991
01:30:40,161 --> 01:30:41,628
She...

992
01:30:41,830 --> 01:30:43,822
...interferes.

993
01:30:46,937 --> 01:30:50,031
Perhaps they need a good...

994
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,833
...talking-to.

995
01:30:52,276 --> 01:30:53,106
If...

996
01:30:53,311 --> 01:30:56,075
...you don't mind my saying so.

997
01:30:56,881 --> 01:30:58,509
Perhaps...

998
01:30:59,051 --> 01:31:00,746
...a bit more.

999
01:31:03,956 --> 01:31:05,184
My girls, sir...

1000
01:31:05,390 --> 01:31:09,191
...they didn't care for
the Overlook at first.

1001
01:31:09,864 --> 01:31:13,767
One of them actually stole
a pack of matches...

1002
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:16,631
...and tried to burn it down.

1003
01:31:17,706 --> 01:31:19,367
But I...

1004
01:31:19,574 --> 01:31:21,541
...corrected them, sir.

1005
01:31:22,878 --> 01:31:27,008
And when my wife tried to prevent me
from doing my duty...

1006
01:31:27,216 --> 01:31:28,478
...I...

1007
01:31:29,486 --> 01:31:31,579
...corrected her.

1008
01:31:45,838 --> 01:31:47,772
We have the Snowcat.

1009
01:31:51,178 --> 01:31:52,942
If the weather breaks...

1010
01:31:53,147 --> 01:31:54,910
...we might just be able...

1011
01:31:55,116 --> 01:31:56,981
...to get down the mountain.

1012
01:31:59,854 --> 01:32:02,824
I could call
the forest rangers first...

1013
01:32:03,025 --> 01:32:04,322
...and...

1014
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:06,525
...tell them that we're coming...

1015
01:32:06,896 --> 01:32:08,056
....so that...

1016
01:32:08,264 --> 01:32:12,361
...they could start searching
for us in case we didn't make it.

1017
01:32:16,141 --> 01:32:18,302
And if Jack won't come with us...

1018
01:32:20,779 --> 01:32:24,511
...I'll just have to tell him that
we're going by ourselves.

1019
01:32:24,717 --> 01:32:26,685
That's all there is to it.

1020
01:32:28,055 --> 01:32:29,545
Redrum.

1021
01:32:30,524 --> 01:32:32,186
Redrum.

1022
01:32:43,439 --> 01:32:44,599
What's the matter, hon?

1023
01:32:44,807 --> 01:32:45,705
Redrum!

1024
01:32:45,908 --> 01:32:47,968
Are you having a bad dream?

1025
01:32:53,918 --> 01:32:55,147
Hon?

1026
01:33:00,959 --> 01:33:04,862
Danny's not here, Mrs. Torrance.

1027
01:33:09,869 --> 01:33:11,394
Come on, hon.

1028
01:33:12,373 --> 01:33:13,806
Wake up.

1029
01:33:14,742 --> 01:33:17,006
You just had a bad dream.

1030
01:33:18,412 --> 01:33:20,540
Everything's okay.

1031
01:33:24,619 --> 01:33:28,488
Danny can't wake up, Mrs. Torrance.

1032
01:33:37,969 --> 01:33:39,766
Wake up!

1033
01:33:40,939 --> 01:33:42,271
Come on.

1034
01:33:42,474 --> 01:33:43,998
Right now.

1035
01:33:44,476 --> 01:33:45,841
Wake up!

1036
01:33:49,884 --> 01:33:53,911
Danny's gone away, Mrs. Torrance.

1037
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:06,900
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

1038
01:34:07,103 --> 01:34:10,038
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1039
01:34:10,341 --> 01:34:12,104
Are you receiving me?

1040
01:34:15,313 --> 01:34:18,771
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

1041
01:34:19,117 --> 01:34:21,916
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1042
01:34:22,121 --> 01:34:23,782
Do you read me?

1043
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:31,187
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

1044
01:34:31,399 --> 01:34:33,959
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1045
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:35,931
Are you receiving me?

1046
01:35:12,379 --> 01:35:14,244
Good evening. Forest service.

1047
01:35:14,448 --> 01:35:16,679
This is Dick Hallorann again.

1048
01:35:16,885 --> 01:35:19,979
I called a while ago about
the folks at the Overlook Hotel.

1049
01:35:21,222 --> 01:35:25,023
We tried to contact them several
times but they didn't answer.

1050
01:35:25,227 --> 01:35:28,822
Maybe they got their radio
turned off or they can't hear it.

1051
01:35:29,031 --> 01:35:31,933
If you'd like, I'd be glad
to try again later on.

1052
01:35:32,437 --> 01:35:34,564
That's very nice of you.

1053
01:35:34,772 --> 01:35:36,535
I'll call you back later.

1054
01:35:36,741 --> 01:35:37,765
Bye.

1055
01:36:24,864 --> 01:36:27,891
Pardon me, miss.
What time will we get to Denver?

1056
01:36:28,101 --> 01:36:30,262
We're due to arrive at 8:20, sir.

1057
01:36:30,470 --> 01:36:32,062
Thank you very much.

1058
01:37:35,981 --> 01:37:36,913
Durkin's Garage.

1059
01:37:37,115 --> 01:37:38,241
Can I speak to Larry?

1060
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:39,417
Speaking.

1061
01:37:39,718 --> 01:37:42,209
Hi, Larry. This is Dick.
Dick Hallorann.

1062
01:37:42,487 --> 01:37:44,149
Dick! How you doing?

1063
01:37:44,357 --> 01:37:45,722
How's the weather down there?

1064
01:37:45,925 --> 01:37:49,088
I'm not in Florida.
I'm calling from Stapleton Airport.

1065
01:37:49,462 --> 01:37:51,054
What are you doing there?

1066
01:37:51,498 --> 01:37:54,934
I just got in from Miami.
I got to get to the Overlook today.

1067
01:37:55,136 --> 01:37:56,763
What's the weather like there?

1068
01:37:57,405 --> 01:38:00,273
The snowplows are keeping things
moving in town...

1069
01:38:00,476 --> 01:38:02,410
...but the mountain roads
are blocked.

1070
01:38:02,945 --> 01:38:05,641
Then I'm going to need a Snowcat
to get up there.

1071
01:38:05,848 --> 01:38:07,680
Can you fix me up with one?

1072
01:38:07,884 --> 01:38:09,977
What's the big deal
about getting there today...

1073
01:38:10,187 --> 01:38:11,745
...especially in this weather?

1074
01:38:12,623 --> 01:38:16,082
Larry, just between you and me,
we got a very serious problem...

1075
01:38:16,295 --> 01:38:18,525
...with the people taking care
of the place.

1076
01:38:18,731 --> 01:38:22,600
They turned out to be
completely unreliable assholes.

1077
01:38:22,802 --> 01:38:24,599
Ullman phoned me last night.

1078
01:38:24,804 --> 01:38:28,171
And I'm supposed to find out
if they have to be replaced.

1079
01:38:29,643 --> 01:38:31,669
How long will it take you
to get here?

1080
01:38:32,013 --> 01:38:33,674
About five hours.

1081
01:38:33,881 --> 01:38:36,111
I'm going to rent a car
here at the airport.

1082
01:38:36,617 --> 01:38:38,347
Okay, I'll take care of it.

1083
01:38:38,553 --> 01:38:41,386
Thanks, Larry.
I really appreciate that.

1084
01:38:41,590 --> 01:38:44,150
That's all right. Drive carefully.

1085
01:38:49,899 --> 01:38:53,164
You're with Hal and Charlie
on Radio 63, KHOW, Denver.

1086
01:38:53,369 --> 01:38:55,930
And we have a bad day out there.

1087
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:59,507
Heavy snow throughout
the Denver metro area.

1088
01:38:59,711 --> 01:39:01,201
Many mountain passes...

1089
01:39:01,413 --> 01:39:04,281
... Wolf Creek and Red Mountain
passes are closed...

1090
01:39:04,483 --> 01:39:07,782
...and the chain law is in effect
at the Eisenhower Tunnel.

1091
01:39:07,987 --> 01:39:09,649
We hear from the news department...

1092
01:39:09,856 --> 01:39:13,053
...only a few flights are
landing at Stapleton Airport...

1093
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:14,852
...and with storms like this...

1094
01:39:15,062 --> 01:39:19,193
...I guess the entire airport will
be closed within the hour.

1095
01:39:19,368 --> 01:39:22,235
The storm will continue through
the day and the Weather Service...

1096
01:39:22,438 --> 01:39:24,907
...has declared a stockman's
and traveler's advisory...

1097
01:39:25,108 --> 01:39:27,906
...for all areas outlying
the Denver metro region.

1098
01:39:28,111 --> 01:39:29,476
Get the cows in the barn.

1099
01:39:50,971 --> 01:39:52,029
Hon?

1100
01:39:57,011 --> 01:39:59,445
Listen to me
for a minute, will you?

1101
01:40:03,252 --> 01:40:06,950
I'm just going to go and
talk to Daddy for a few minutes...

1102
01:40:07,157 --> 01:40:09,182
...and I'll be right back.

1103
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:12,686
I want you to just stay here...

1104
01:40:12,897 --> 01:40:15,388
...and watch your cartoons, okay?

1105
01:40:18,504 --> 01:40:19,972
Okay, hon?

1106
01:40:23,276 --> 01:40:26,142
Yes, Mrs. Torrance.

1107
01:40:34,921 --> 01:40:36,116
All right.

1108
01:40:38,192 --> 01:40:41,093
I'll be back
in just about five minutes.

1109
01:40:41,897 --> 01:40:44,230
I'm going to lock the door
behind me.

1110
01:44:10,607 --> 01:44:12,302
How do you like it?

1111
01:44:18,916 --> 01:44:20,440
How do you like it?

1112
01:44:30,397 --> 01:44:33,059
What are you doing down here?

1113
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:39,771
I just...

1114
01:44:40,241 --> 01:44:41,265
...wanted...

1115
01:44:41,710 --> 01:44:43,439
...to talk to you.

1116
01:44:45,816 --> 01:44:47,078
Okay.

1117
01:44:47,684 --> 01:44:49,151
Let's talk.

1118
01:44:58,963 --> 01:45:00,955
What do you want to talk about?

1119
01:45:08,876 --> 01:45:12,039
I can't really remember.

1120
01:45:12,847 --> 01:45:14,974
You can't remember.

1121
01:45:15,784 --> 01:45:17,115
No...

1122
01:45:17,486 --> 01:45:18,885
...I can't.

1123
01:45:24,193 --> 01:45:27,458
Maybe it was about Danny?

1124
01:45:29,833 --> 01:45:32,530
Maybe it was about him.

1125
01:45:36,174 --> 01:45:39,474
I think we should discuss Danny.

1126
01:45:42,281 --> 01:45:44,078
I think...

1127
01:45:44,483 --> 01:45:48,250
...we should discuss
what should be done with him.

1128
01:45:52,959 --> 01:45:55,554
What should be done with him?

1129
01:46:00,535 --> 01:46:02,332
I don't know.

1130
01:46:02,838 --> 01:46:04,829
I don't think that's true.

1131
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,634
I think you have some
very definite ideas...

1132
01:46:07,844 --> 01:46:09,539
...about what should be done
with Danny.

1133
01:46:09,746 --> 01:46:12,341
And I'd like to know
what they are.

1134
01:46:14,251 --> 01:46:16,048
Well, l...

1135
01:46:16,353 --> 01:46:20,757
...I think maybe he should be taken
to a doctor.

1136
01:46:20,959 --> 01:46:24,258
You think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

1137
01:46:26,499 --> 01:46:29,832
When do you think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

1138
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:31,835
As soon as possible?

1139
01:46:32,439 --> 01:46:34,772
"As soon as possible?"

1140
01:46:37,445 --> 01:46:38,878
Please.

1141
01:46:40,281 --> 01:46:43,547
You believe his health
might be at stake.

1142
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,644
Yes.

1143
01:46:47,991 --> 01:46:50,620
And you are concerned about him.

1144
01:46:53,197 --> 01:46:55,427
And are you concerned about me?

1145
01:46:56,267 --> 01:46:57,428
Of course I am.

1146
01:46:57,636 --> 01:46:59,866
Of course you are!

1147
01:47:00,072 --> 01:47:03,200
Have you ever thought about
my responsibilities?

1148
01:47:03,408 --> 01:47:04,899
What are you talking about?

1149
01:47:05,111 --> 01:47:07,944
Have you ever had
a single moment's...

1150
01:47:08,148 --> 01:47:10,207
...thought about
my responsibilities?

1151
01:47:10,417 --> 01:47:12,682
Have you ever thought
for a single moment...

1152
01:47:12,888 --> 01:47:15,686
...about my responsibilities
to my employers?!

1153
01:47:15,957 --> 01:47:17,788
Has is ever occurred to you...

1154
01:47:17,993 --> 01:47:21,486
...that I have agreed to look after
the hotel until May 1st?

1155
01:47:21,731 --> 01:47:23,756
Does it matter to you at all...

1156
01:47:23,966 --> 01:47:27,060
...that the owners have placed
their complete confidence in me...

1157
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:30,399
...and that I have signed
a letter of agreement...

1158
01:47:30,608 --> 01:47:33,202
...in which I've accepted
that responsibility?

1159
01:47:33,678 --> 01:47:35,703
Do you have the slightest idea...

1160
01:47:35,914 --> 01:47:39,146
...what a moral and ethical
principal is? Do you?!

1161
01:47:39,518 --> 01:47:42,611
Has it ever occurred to you what
would happen to my future...

1162
01:47:42,820 --> 01:47:45,221
...if I fail to live up to
my responsibilities?

1163
01:47:45,424 --> 01:47:47,722
Has it ever occurred to you?
Has it?!

1164
01:47:47,927 --> 01:47:49,451
Stay away from me!

1165
01:47:50,330 --> 01:47:51,388
Why?

1166
01:47:51,699 --> 01:47:54,668
I just want to go back to my room.

1167
01:47:54,869 --> 01:47:56,131
Why?

1168
01:47:56,771 --> 01:47:57,635
Well...

1169
01:47:58,773 --> 01:48:00,799
...I'm very confused.

1170
01:48:01,944 --> 01:48:05,607
And I just need a chance
to think things over.

1171
01:48:06,648 --> 01:48:10,585
You've had your whole fucking life
to think things over!

1172
01:48:10,788 --> 01:48:13,552
What good's a few minutes more
going to do you now?

1173
01:48:14,525 --> 01:48:16,016
Stay away from me!

1174
01:48:16,361 --> 01:48:17,658
Please!

1175
01:48:18,430 --> 01:48:19,488
Don't hurt me.

1176
01:48:19,698 --> 01:48:21,029
I'm not going to hurt you.

1177
01:48:21,232 --> 01:48:22,426
Stay away from me!

1178
01:48:22,634 --> 01:48:23,499
Stay away!

1179
01:48:23,703 --> 01:48:24,692
Darling.

1180
01:48:24,904 --> 01:48:26,462
Light of my life.

1181
01:48:26,906 --> 01:48:28,237
I'm not going to hurt you.

1182
01:48:28,441 --> 01:48:30,432
You didn't let me finish
my sentence.

1183
01:48:30,645 --> 01:48:32,840
I said,
"I'm not going to hurt you."

1184
01:48:33,047 --> 01:48:35,811
I'm just going to bash
your brains in.

1185
01:48:36,084 --> 01:48:39,054
I'm going to bash them
right the fuck in.

1186
01:48:40,122 --> 01:48:41,680
Stay away from me!

1187
01:48:42,191 --> 01:48:43,215
Stay away from me!

1188
01:48:43,425 --> 01:48:45,825
I'm not going to hurt you.

1189
01:48:46,095 --> 01:48:47,620
Stay away from me!

1190
01:48:47,864 --> 01:48:48,922
Stay away!

1191
01:48:49,799 --> 01:48:51,027
Please!

1192
01:48:52,069 --> 01:48:53,832
Stop swinging the bat.

1193
01:48:54,039 --> 01:48:55,301
Stay away from me.

1194
01:48:56,074 --> 01:48:57,371
Put that bat down, Wendy.

1195
01:48:57,576 --> 01:48:59,066
Stop it!

1196
01:49:00,545 --> 01:49:01,671
Give me the bat.

1197
01:49:01,881 --> 01:49:03,007
Please!

1198
01:49:03,249 --> 01:49:05,444
-Stay away!
-Give me the bat.

1199
01:49:05,651 --> 01:49:06,709
Stop it!

1200
01:49:06,953 --> 01:49:08,386
Give me the bat.

1201
01:49:08,721 --> 01:49:10,349
-Stay away from me.
-Stop swinging the bat.

1202
01:49:10,557 --> 01:49:11,922
Please stop!

1203
01:49:12,127 --> 01:49:13,321
Give me the bat.

1204
01:49:13,528 --> 01:49:14,756
Stay away from me.

1205
01:49:15,030 --> 01:49:17,397
-Stop it!
-Give me the bat.

1206
01:49:18,801 --> 01:49:19,825
Goddamn--!

1207
01:50:35,123 --> 01:50:36,819
What are you doing?

1208
01:50:39,628 --> 01:50:41,095
Wait a minute.

1209
01:50:42,498 --> 01:50:44,490
What are you doing?

1210
01:50:47,337 --> 01:50:48,565
What are you doing?

1211
01:51:02,455 --> 01:51:03,945
Wait a minute!

1212
01:51:06,325 --> 01:51:07,918
What are you doing?

1213
01:51:08,162 --> 01:51:09,891
Open the door!

1214
01:51:11,198 --> 01:51:12,222
Goddamn it!

1215
01:51:12,432 --> 01:51:15,994
Let me out of here!
Open the goddamn door!

1216
01:51:19,707 --> 01:51:20,935
Wendy, listen.

1217
01:51:21,376 --> 01:51:24,312
Let me out and I'll forget
the whole goddamn thing.

1218
01:51:24,513 --> 01:51:26,981
It'll be just like
nothing ever happened.

1219
01:51:41,667 --> 01:51:43,032
Baby.

1220
01:51:44,236 --> 01:51:47,536
I think you hurt my head
real bad.

1221
01:51:49,142 --> 01:51:50,803
I'm dizzy.

1222
01:51:51,811 --> 01:51:54,007
I need a doctor.

1223
01:52:00,889 --> 01:52:02,084
Honey.

1224
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:07,092
Don't leave me in here.

1225
01:52:15,707 --> 01:52:17,608
I'm going to go now.

1226
01:52:20,679 --> 01:52:22,510
I'm going to try...

1227
01:52:22,715 --> 01:52:25,708
...to get Danny down
the Sidewinder...

1228
01:52:26,419 --> 01:52:28,785
...in the Snowcat today.

1229
01:52:31,024 --> 01:52:32,856
I'll bring back a doctor.

1230
01:52:38,233 --> 01:52:40,099
I'm going to go now.

1231
01:52:47,543 --> 01:52:51,344
You've got a big surprise
coming to you.

1232
01:52:52,816 --> 01:52:55,410
You're not going anywhere.

1233
01:52:57,089 --> 01:53:01,219
Go check out the Snowcat and the
radio, and you'll see what I mean.

1234
01:53:05,832 --> 01:53:07,527
Go check it out.

1235
01:53:09,669 --> 01:53:11,865
Go check it out!

1236
01:53:15,242 --> 01:53:17,176
Go check it out.

1237
01:55:05,037 --> 01:55:07,437
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.

1238
01:55:08,175 --> 01:55:10,143
Delbert Grady.

1239
01:55:11,711 --> 01:55:13,303
Grady?

1240
01:55:33,671 --> 01:55:35,502
Hello, Grady.

1241
01:55:40,179 --> 01:55:41,976
Mr. Torrance...

1242
01:55:43,916 --> 01:55:47,648
...I see you can hardly
have taken care of the...

1243
01:55:48,388 --> 01:55:50,879
...business we discussed.

1244
01:55:57,599 --> 01:56:00,534
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady.

1245
01:56:01,403 --> 01:56:05,465
I'll deal with that situation
as soon as I get out of here.

1246
01:56:06,343 --> 01:56:09,073
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance?

1247
01:56:09,579 --> 01:56:11,411
I wonder.

1248
01:56:12,583 --> 01:56:14,676
I have my doubts.

1249
01:56:15,887 --> 01:56:20,120
I, and others, have come
to believe...

1250
01:56:20,325 --> 01:56:23,317
...that your heart is not in this.

1251
01:56:23,963 --> 01:56:26,489
That you haven't the belly for it.

1252
01:56:32,673 --> 01:56:36,974
Just give me one more chance
to prove it, Mr. Grady.

1253
01:56:37,812 --> 01:56:39,746
That's all I ask.

1254
01:56:41,284 --> 01:56:45,551
Your wife appears to be stronger
than we imagined, Mr. Torrance.

1255
01:56:45,756 --> 01:56:47,222
Somewhat more...

1256
01:56:47,423 --> 01:56:49,391
...resourceful.

1257
01:56:49,660 --> 01:56:52,424
She seems to have got
the better of you.

1258
01:56:55,666 --> 01:56:58,329
For the moment, Mr. Grady.

1259
01:56:59,070 --> 01:57:01,231
Only for the moment.

1260
01:57:03,142 --> 01:57:07,307
I fear you will have to deal
with this matter...

1261
01:57:07,581 --> 01:57:11,244
...in the harshest possible way,
Mr. Torrance.

1262
01:57:11,818 --> 01:57:13,377
I fear...

1263
01:57:13,654 --> 01:57:16,214
...that is the only thing to do.

1264
01:57:19,694 --> 01:57:21,788
There's nothing
I look forward to...

1265
01:57:21,997 --> 01:57:25,899
...with greater pleasure,
Mr. Grady.

1266
01:57:27,303 --> 01:57:30,034
You give your word on that,
do you, Mr. Torrance?

1267
01:57:31,508 --> 01:57:33,533
I give you my word.

1268
01:58:45,661 --> 01:58:48,222
Redrum.

1269
01:58:49,166 --> 01:58:51,726
Redrum.

1270
02:00:59,718 --> 02:01:01,276
Danny, stop it!

1271
02:01:58,086 --> 02:01:59,553
I'm home.

1272
02:02:36,898 --> 02:02:39,765
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1273
02:03:05,331 --> 02:03:07,196
I can't get out.

1274
02:03:08,001 --> 02:03:09,127
Run!

1275
02:03:09,969 --> 02:03:11,402
Run and hide!

1276
02:03:11,940 --> 02:03:13,066
Run!

1277
02:03:13,274 --> 02:03:14,502
Quick!

1278
02:03:16,211 --> 02:03:20,740
Little pigs, little pigs,
let me come in.

1279
02:03:26,489 --> 02:03:29,891
Not by the hair
on your chinny-chin-chin?

1280
02:03:31,429 --> 02:03:33,488
Then I'll huff...

1281
02:03:33,698 --> 02:03:35,599
...and I'll puff...

1282
02:03:35,801 --> 02:03:37,860
...and I'll blow your house in!

1283
02:03:52,788 --> 02:03:54,153
Please!

1284
02:03:54,890 --> 02:03:56,653
Don't!

1285
02:03:57,325 --> 02:03:58,850
Don't!

1286
02:04:17,449 --> 02:04:18,677
Stop it!

1287
02:04:22,922 --> 02:04:24,480
Here's Johnny!

1288
02:07:06,446 --> 02:07:07,674
Hello?

1289
02:07:13,121 --> 02:07:14,884
Anybody here?

1290
02:07:36,983 --> 02:07:38,541
Hello?

1291
02:07:50,863 --> 02:07:52,695
Anybody here?

1292
02:08:22,668 --> 02:08:24,603
Anybody here?

1293
02:09:05,619 --> 02:09:07,314
Danny-boy!

1294
02:11:48,175 --> 02:11:50,109
I'm coming!

1295
02:11:52,613 --> 02:11:54,548
I'm coming, Dan!

1296
02:12:55,353 --> 02:12:57,754
Great party, isn't it?

1297
02:13:15,409 --> 02:13:17,639
I'm coming!!

1298
02:13:20,215 --> 02:13:22,513
You can't get away!

1299
02:13:26,389 --> 02:13:28,881
I'm right behind you!

1300
02:17:27,269 --> 02:17:29,295
-Mommy!
-Danny, come here!

1301
02:17:30,508 --> 02:17:32,237
Mommy.

1302
02:17:40,586 --> 02:17:41,985
Where...?
