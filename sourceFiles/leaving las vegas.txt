1
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:49,278
- To a wonderful film. You were great.
- Thank you.

2
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,513
- What a romantic you are.
- To the agency and my little protégé.

3
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:54,521
Bless you.
Thank you, daddy.

4
00:00:57,358 --> 00:01:00,122
Eight years at Berlitz,
that's what you learn?

5
00:01:00,195 --> 00:01:02,026
He learned chin the first month
and then chin-chin.

6
00:01:02,097 --> 00:01:03,962
Am I right?

7
00:01:04,032 --> 00:01:05,465
I can't be clever.

8
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,626
It was really beautiful,
what you guys did.

9
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:11,638
It was beautiful,
and you guys are great.

10
00:01:11,706 --> 00:01:13,071
I love the food here.

11
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:17,635
The nicest thing about the film
is that we get to handle guns.

12
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,679
- I had never done that.
- Peter.

13
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,180
- Very rare.
- What?

14
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:23,649
- How are you?
- Wow. Ben, how are you?

15
00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:25,652
Outstanding, sir.

16
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:31,254
Excuse me.
Ben Sanderson, Marc Nussbaum.

17
00:01:31,326 --> 00:01:33,590
- Of course.
- How are you?

18
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:35,424
- Sheila.
- Ladies.

19
00:01:35,497 --> 00:01:38,091
- Hi, Ben.
- Nice to meet you.

20
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:43,866
I'm a big fan of your writing.
I thought Bay of Pigs was great.

21
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:48,398
Actually, I didn't write it,
I just got the credit. I was fired.

22
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,947
Didn't I talk to you a couple
of years ago when you both worked...

23
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:56,448
- at MGM with Laddie?
- That's right, by God.

24
00:01:56,518 --> 00:01:59,453
So are you still at ICM?

25
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:03,617
- I'm at TriStar.
- You're at TriStar.

26
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:07,457
- You'll have to say hello to Mike.
- I will.

27
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:11,989
He's not there anymore,
but I'll hunt him down.

28
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:14,967
- Can I talk to you, please?
- Sure.

29
00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:16,799
- Please?
- Be right back.

30
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:20,432
Hold the fort, kiddo.
I have my own office this way.

31
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:23,033
- What is the matter with him?
- He's sick.

32
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:25,442
I can't help you anymore.
Do you understand?

33
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:30,246
This is the last time. I promise.
I just need some cash tonight.

34
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,311
- How are you?
- I lost my credit cards.

35
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:37,256
The money will be on your desk
first thing in the morning.

36
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:41,261
How's the new one coming along?
I hear you got Dickie Gere.

37
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:45,095
- That is great, man.
- I got everybody in the movie.

38
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,101
Look, you're sick.

39
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,603
This is all I have in cash.

40
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:54,267
Please, don't drink it in here.

41
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:58,410
- Man.
- That's fine, Peter.

42
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,947
I'll messenger it over to you
in the morning.

43
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:03,950
I don't want it.

44
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:08,284
I think it would be the best thing
if you don't contact me again.

45
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:21,058
- What's your name?
- Terri.

46
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:24,070
- Terri, I am going to buy you a drink.
- I'm okay. Thanks.

47
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:30,272
Bud, please. Buy the lady a drink
and another one for you.

48
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,710
I'm Benjamin. Ben.

49
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,079
Benny Goodman, that's me.
I think you're sexy. That's right.

50
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,586
Look at those eyes.
Sexy like a kitty cat.

51
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:41,747
You turn me on

52
00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:45,918
You're not too tall
You're not too short

53
00:03:45,994 --> 00:03:47,757
You're not too round

54
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:51,458
You're like a cat
The cat in the hat

55
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,932
Look at those eyes.
Honest to God.

56
00:03:54,002 --> 00:03:56,596
You're luminescent, baby.
What?

57
00:03:56,671 --> 00:04:00,437
- You've been drinking all day.
- Of course.

58
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,101
Speaking of drinks,
here is yours.

59
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:04,644
- Thanks.
- Down that hatch.

60
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:07,146
And here is mine.
Cheers. Come on.

61
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:10,616
There we go.
Let's do it to it.

62
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:18,951
I just thought
of an amazing concept.

63
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:21,154
What do you say
we finish these...

64
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:24,289
and we go back
to my apartment on the beach!

65
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:26,697
I'll throw a movie in the VCR...

66
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:29,635
and mix you up
a gooey blender drink.

67
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:31,035
Sound good? Sound sexy?

68
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:47,352
Bud, give me another.

69
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:55,426
I really wish you'd come home with me.
You're so cute.

70
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:58,294
I'm really good in bed too.
Believe me.

71
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:03,433
And you smell great...

72
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:06,439
and you look great
and your hair's great.

73
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:14,712
Look, I've got to wake up early
in the morning.

74
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:18,274
I have to go. Thank you.

75
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:27,054
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.

76
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:32,527
Maybe I shouldn't breathe so much.

77
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:43,367
That's it, pal.
We're closing up now.

78
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:45,446
I'm gonna finish this.

79
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:19,129
Hey, Mr. Erection,
you want a date?

80
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:23,435
The room is 20.
You pay for it.

81
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:27,243
But only because I think...

82
00:07:27,315 --> 00:07:32,582
that the concept of surrender...

83
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:37,249
fits with the big picture right now.

84
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:44,056
Hey, get outta the street!

85
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:54,906
I don't remember
if I started drinking...

86
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:57,739
because my wife left me or...

87
00:07:57,845 --> 00:08:02,077
my wife left me
'cause I started drinking.

88
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,083
Fuck it anyway!

89
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,077
Next, please.

90
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:13,252
One moment, sir.

91
00:09:17,158 --> 00:09:19,683
Sign the back
of the check, please.

92
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:26,255
- Can't you just cash it as it is?
- Is there a problem?

93
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:40,238
I'm a little shaky right now.

94
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,884
I had brain surgery.

95
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:49,048
I'll go get some lunch,
and then I'll come back...

96
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:51,614
and take care of it then.

97
00:09:56,998 --> 00:09:59,728
Next I'll have a gin and tonic.

98
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:04,770
Do you know what time it is?

99
00:10:06,507 --> 00:10:09,271
You should be drinking coffee.

100
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,106
You're a young guy.

101
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:18,413
It's none of my business...

102
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:22,752
but if you could see
what I see...

103
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,257
you wouldn't be doing this
to yourself.

104
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:35,235
I understand
what you're saying.

105
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,066
I appreciate your concern.

106
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:42,535
It's not my intention
to make you uncomfortable.

107
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:49,048
Please, serve me today,
and I'll never come in here again.

108
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:51,209
If I do, you can 86 me.

109
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:53,219
Stop fucking with me!

110
00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:56,722
I can 86 you anytime I want to.

111
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,275
I don't give a fuck what you do.

112
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,368
That one's on the house, son.

113
00:11:18,446 --> 00:11:20,277
Were you in Los Angeles
for the earthquake?

114
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,611
- It was pretty scary.
- Did you have a lot of damage?

115
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:26,244
- Just a little bit.
- Are you desirable?

116
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,016
Are you irresistible?

117
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,355
Maybe if you drank bourbon with me,
it would help.

118
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:36,954
If you kissed me, and I could taste
the sting in your mouth, it would help.

119
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:38,725
If you drank bourbon with me naked...

120
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:42,701
if you smelled of bourbon
as you fucked me, it would help.

121
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,864
It would increase
my esteem for you...

122
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,673
if you poured bourbon on your naked body
and said to me, "Drink this."

123
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:55,842
If you spread your legs and you had
bourbon dripping from your breasts...

124
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:59,682
and your pussy and said,
"Drink here"...

125
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:02,881
then I could
fall in love with you.

126
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:06,393
Because then I would have a purpose:
to clean you up.

127
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,794
And that would prove...

128
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:13,264
that I'm worth something.

129
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:18,931
I'd lick you clean so that you could
go away and fuck someone else.

130
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:20,940
Our business is
to make our customers happy.

131
00:12:22,777 --> 00:12:24,972
Next, please.

132
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,313
I am back.

133
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:32,148
I've got my check,
and, baby, I'm ready to sign.

134
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:37,017
There.

135
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:41,419
Steady as a fucking rock.
Excuse my French.

136
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:45,522
Want to have dinner with me?

137
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:50,528
But what's the back end like?

138
00:12:50,638 --> 00:12:53,937
By the time we're through
with P and A...

139
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:56,875
the "above the line"
is gonna take it to about 15.

140
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,913
With something like this,
what would Disney think?

141
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,381
Messages.

142
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,714
What did Diller say?

143
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,548
Listen, I'm very busy.
Just kidding.

144
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,217
Can I call you back on this?

145
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:14,727
Ciao for now.

146
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:17,263
Could somebody fix the phones
around here?

147
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:19,663
- Good morning.
- Mr. Simpson's looking for you.

148
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:21,633
He wants you to go in
as soon as you get...

149
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:29,871
- Are you all right?
- Outstanding.

150
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:35,678
But I have to go
to a very important meeting.

151
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:38,183
Could make a couple million
for the company.

152
00:13:44,592 --> 00:13:46,025
What?

153
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:51,897
You should go in there now.

154
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:01,908
- Hi, Bill.
- Take a seat.

155
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:14,583
We're gonna let you go.

156
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:39,707
This is too generous, Bill.

157
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:48,146
We really liked having you around,
but you know how it is.

158
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,849
I'm sorry.

159
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:57,552
What are you gonna do now?

160
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,062
I thought...

161
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:10,076
I thought
I'd move out to Las Vegas.

162
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,538
My name is Yuri Botsov.

163
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,699
Where you from, Yuri?

164
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:45,267
You sure don't sound like you come
from around these parts.

165
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:47,871
That is very true.

166
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,314
Very good observation.
I am from Latvia.

167
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:53,982
Very tough place.

168
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:57,512
I hear this,
but I am not a tough man.

169
00:15:57,591 --> 00:16:01,994
I am a humble man who is here to learn
from my friends in the New World.

170
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:28,482
This must be Yuri's friend.

171
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:32,286
Sera is my gift to you all.

172
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,821
You will find her a very willing girl
for each of you...

173
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,988
just as we arranged.

174
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:42,230
So, I have business to attend.
Please, enjoy.

175
00:16:42,265 --> 00:16:44,727
So, I have business to attend.
Please, enjoy.

176
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:57,483
Do you wanna watch?

177
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:53,639
Are you scared?

178
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,814
It's all right.

179
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,485
It's okay.

180
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:20,826
I bring out the best
in the men who fuck me.

181
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:23,495
It's not easy,
but I'm very good.

182
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:27,097
It's amazing. I haven't worked
for a really long time...

183
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:29,768
and I can just turn on a dime.

184
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:32,038
I can just become
who they want me to be.

185
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,774
I walk into that room,
I know right away...

186
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:37,077
this is their fantasy,
and I become it.

187
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:41,450
I'm that service.
I perform it, and I perform it well.

188
00:18:41,522 --> 00:18:42,955
I'm an equation mostly.

189
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:48,290
Thirty minutes of my body
costs $300.

190
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:50,626
That's just to get into the room.

191
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:54,133
It's about $500 after that.
We negotiate.

192
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:56,931
But it's a performance.

193
00:18:57,004 --> 00:18:59,529
It's definitely a performance.

194
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:03,303
I am very pleased with how
you've moved up in the world.

195
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:07,074
It is, after all,
a glamorous world I showed you.

196
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:14,480
Why did you leave me
in Los Angeles?

197
00:19:17,057 --> 00:19:18,991
Because you are sly.

198
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:23,161
You knew there was more money
here in Las Vegas.

199
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:30,161
You don't need to fear me, Sera...

200
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:32,501
because we belong together.

201
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,004
Don't we?

202
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:50,820
- Are you lonely?
- I am lonely, Yuri.

203
00:19:50,891 --> 00:19:52,654
So am I.

204
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:23,306
Janek, we called you last night!

205
00:22:23,377 --> 00:22:25,607
There was no one home.

206
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:31,447
We're 30 miles
outside of Las Vegas.

207
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:36,455
Someone saw him there yesterday.

208
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,352
No, this is the end of it!

209
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:47,924
Yuri knew what he was doing.

210
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:18,461
That was a red light.

211
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:20,466
I walk, you stop.

212
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,665
Are you sorry?

213
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,705
Good.

214
00:23:47,227 --> 00:23:50,719
Three towels in each room
and a complimentary bar of soap.

215
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:55,757
If you run out of soap,
you can buy an extra bar.

216
00:23:55,836 --> 00:23:58,396
Feel free to use our pool,
but use it at your own risk.

217
00:23:58,472 --> 00:24:01,600
- There are three towels in your room.
- Do you have vacancies?

218
00:24:02,676 --> 00:24:05,110
We do.
I'll be with you in a minute.

219
00:24:05,178 --> 00:24:09,114
Linens are provided for you.
Rooms are $29 a night.

220
00:24:09,182 --> 00:24:13,243
You pay at the beginning of each week.
Maid service is optional.

221
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:23,123
Maid service is optional.
It costs $3.50 a day.

222
00:24:23,196 --> 00:24:26,290
Feel free to use the pool,
but use it at your own risk.

223
00:24:26,366 --> 00:24:28,459
We don't have a lifeguard.

224
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:33,472
No kids, no pets and no guests
after 11:00 at night.

225
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,474
You've been provided
with three towels.

226
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:39,478
We expect when you check out
there will still be three towels.

227
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:41,377
There's a complimentary
bar of soap.

228
00:24:42,716 --> 00:24:46,208
I walked into the room,
and he was lying on the bed.

229
00:24:46,286 --> 00:24:49,551
He had his arms
behind his head...

230
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:53,059
and there was
just hair everywhere.

231
00:24:53,126 --> 00:24:55,924
He was really, really fat.

232
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,328
He had a large erection.

233
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:03,028
I remember he was so proud
of his large erection.

234
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:11,207
I asked him where my money was,
and he pointed to the dresser.

235
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:14,042
And then I asked him
what he wanted...

236
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:19,518
and he said,
"Lie down, I'm on top."

237
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:25,024
He started pounding me
really hard.

238
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:30,195
I had to bite my tongue
to keep from crying.

239
00:25:31,765 --> 00:25:35,861
He did that for awhile,
and then I started to get up.

240
00:25:35,936 --> 00:25:40,703
He pushed me back down,
and he held my hair.

241
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:46,245
He was pulling it,
and he stuck his penis in my mouth.

242
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:51,808
I tried to get up again,
and he said...

243
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:56,879
"Stay there, baby,
I'm gonna come on your face."

244
00:25:56,957 --> 00:26:00,484
So he did.

245
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,496
Then he rubbed his semen
all over my face and in my hair.

246
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:12,764
Then he kicked me off the bed
and told me to leave.

247
00:26:44,571 --> 00:26:47,597
- Are you working?
- What do you mean? I'm walking.

248
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:50,676
Just wait one second.

249
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,044
Great ass!

250
00:26:56,583 --> 00:27:00,110
- Want some?
- Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?

251
00:27:03,523 --> 00:27:05,457
That's pretty funny.

252
00:27:05,525 --> 00:27:09,120
I wonder if you'll take $250
to fuck me?

253
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:14,467
That is, if you'll come
to my room for one hour...

254
00:27:14,534 --> 00:27:16,798
I will give you $500.

255
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:22,140
- You're pretty drunk.
- Not really.

256
00:27:22,242 --> 00:27:24,767
My room's not far.
It's The Whole Year Inn.

257
00:27:24,878 --> 00:27:28,905
You could drive with me if you want
or we could walk.

258
00:27:30,183 --> 00:27:31,616
Or I could give you cab fare.

259
00:27:31,685 --> 00:27:33,277
- In the car.
- Whatever you want.

260
00:27:33,353 --> 00:27:35,787
Why don't you give me the money
in the car?

261
00:27:44,297 --> 00:27:45,958
I'm Ben.

262
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:48,296
I'm Sera.

263
00:27:58,244 --> 00:28:01,236
Sarah with an "H"?

264
00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:05,914
With an "E." S-e-r-a.

265
00:28:10,824 --> 00:28:12,758
You wanna start the engine?

266
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,978
What this room needs
is more booze.

267
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:37,941
- Can I use the bathroom?
- Of course.

268
00:28:39,352 --> 00:28:42,219
Want a drink?
I'm having one.

269
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:45,951
Sure. I'll have a shot of tequila,
if you can spare it.

270
00:29:12,152 --> 00:29:13,710
Your drink's here.

271
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:25,597
For 500 bucks, you can do
pretty much whatever you want.

272
00:29:25,665 --> 00:29:29,465
- You can fuck my ass.
- Oh, my God.

273
00:29:29,536 --> 00:29:35,338
You can come on my face.
Whatever you want to do.

274
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:40,140
Just keep it out of my hair.
I just washed it.

275
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:06,197
Just because my feet
were too big in the morning

276
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:10,675
Just because I can't remember
your mother's name

277
00:30:10,743 --> 00:30:17,114
Just because I put the octopus
in the bed

278
00:30:17,217 --> 00:30:22,052
Just because, because
because, because Bill Cosby

279
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:27,916
You wanna fuck now?

280
00:30:30,697 --> 00:30:35,100
Maybe something to drink first.
More tequila?

281
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:37,559
Whatever.

282
00:31:14,407 --> 00:31:18,207
What's the story?
Are you too drunk to come?

283
00:31:20,146 --> 00:31:23,274
I don't care about any of that.

284
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:33,117
There's time left.
You can have more money.

285
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:36,127
You can drink all you want.

286
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:39,289
Just stay.
That's what I want.

287
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:44,393
I want you to talk or listen.

288
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,960
Just stay.

289
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:08,256
So, Ben with an "N"...

290
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:10,489
what brings you to Las Vegas?

291
00:32:10,563 --> 00:32:12,087
Business convention?

292
00:32:20,006 --> 00:32:25,467
I came here
to drink myself to death.

293
00:32:25,578 --> 00:32:29,031
Cashed in all my money...

294
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:32,450
[Skipped item nr. 294]

295
00:32:32,485 --> 00:32:34,578
gonna sell the car tomorrow.

296
00:32:37,857 --> 00:32:41,258
How long is it gonna take
for you to...

297
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,761
drink yourself to death?

298
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:52,527
I think about four weeks.

299
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:55,106
I don't know for sure,
but I think.

300
00:32:55,208 --> 00:33:00,976
I got enough
for about 250, $300 a day.

301
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:02,947
That should do it.

302
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:07,282
What am I? A luxury?

303
00:33:10,223 --> 00:33:13,989
You're a luxury,
and your meter just ran out.

304
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,221
That's a nice watch.

305
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:18,786
You do like it?

306
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:24,903
You can talk
a little bit more.

307
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:27,268
I don't have to be anywhere.

308
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,107
Talk.

309
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:33,770
In Los Angeles...

310
00:33:35,715 --> 00:33:38,775
I kept running out of booze
and the store would be closed...

311
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:41,979
because I forget
to look at my watch.

312
00:33:45,258 --> 00:33:49,092
I used to live in Los Angeles.

313
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:55,865
But I don't anymore.

314
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:01,133
I think the tough times
are finally behind me.

315
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:08,436
There'll always
be bad things, but...

316
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:10,812
my life is good.

317
00:34:12,018 --> 00:34:14,316
It is as I want it to be.

318
00:34:17,824 --> 00:34:20,122
It's good.

319
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:27,526
It's good being here with you.

320
00:34:45,017 --> 00:34:46,575
Shit.

321
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:08,469
Hey, Bill.
How are you?

322
00:35:24,624 --> 00:35:26,558
Is this a full night's work?

323
00:35:28,928 --> 00:35:31,055
I'm really sorry.

324
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,327
It was such a slow night,
and I couldn't score.

325
00:35:40,006 --> 00:35:41,769
What do you think?

326
00:35:41,841 --> 00:35:44,810
You're just a 16-year-old girl
on Hollywood Boulevard?

327
00:35:44,877 --> 00:35:47,778
Is that what you think?
Is that what you play?

328
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:02,919
Here.

329
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,667
Go ahead.

330
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:33,215
I could kill you, Sera.

331
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:39,223
You work tonight,
and you bring me the money.

332
00:36:39,332 --> 00:36:41,425
It doesn't matter how late.

333
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:44,935
I will.

334
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:51,935
He cut me a couple of times.

335
00:36:52,011 --> 00:36:56,573
He'd always say,
"Never on the face."

336
00:36:59,151 --> 00:37:01,449
So, he cut me right here.

337
00:37:03,856 --> 00:37:06,757
He cried...

338
00:37:06,826 --> 00:37:12,025
and I felt sorry for him.

339
00:37:12,131 --> 00:37:14,361
In his mind,
I'd done something bad...

340
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:18,028
but in my mind
I hadn't done anything bad.

341
00:37:18,137 --> 00:37:20,230
He's kind of paranoid.

342
00:37:31,217 --> 00:37:33,685
This ring is a ruby.
It's my lucky ring.

343
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:36,381
This watch is real gold.
It's not plated.

344
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:38,821
It's the real thing.
Feel how heavy it is.

345
00:37:38,891 --> 00:37:43,851
- These rings, $3,000.
- One thousand.

346
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,921
One thousand?
Look what you're getting.

347
00:37:47,033 --> 00:37:50,161
It's a ruby. It's my lucky ring.
It's a beautiful thing.

348
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:53,432
I can put that in.
Two thousand dollars.

349
00:37:53,506 --> 00:37:58,443
- I can't give you more than a thousand.
- But I just added the ring.

350
00:37:58,511 --> 00:38:00,672
- Synthetic ruby.
- Look...

351
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:02,976
What can I do for you?

352
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,981
Five hundred.

353
00:38:15,728 --> 00:38:20,995
Five hundred dollars
for a 1993 Rolex Daytona watch.

354
00:38:23,102 --> 00:38:24,535
I'll do it.

355
00:38:29,075 --> 00:38:32,909
- How are you doin'?
- I'm doing fine, thank you.

356
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:38,542
Are you here for the convention?

357
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:40,642
I didn't think I was that obvious.

358
00:38:42,455 --> 00:38:47,324
- It was just a wild guess.
- My name's Paul, honey.

359
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:52,889
- Vodka Seven.
- And for the lady?

360
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:55,466
- Are you ready for another one?
- Sure.

361
00:38:55,568 --> 00:38:57,729
- I'll have a margarita.
- Good choice.

362
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,569
Are you alone?

363
00:39:03,743 --> 00:39:06,371
Or are you using me
to make someone jealous?

364
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:09,380
Alone. I'm here alone.

365
00:39:10,616 --> 00:39:12,481
Thank you.

366
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:15,653
Cheers.

367
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,684
Where are you staying?

368
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,024
Right here at the hotel.
Why?

369
00:39:24,463 --> 00:39:27,023
I thought
you might be looking for a date.

370
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:30,569
"A date"?
What are you, a hooker?

371
00:39:30,636 --> 00:39:33,127
What exactly do you mean
by a date?

372
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:35,400
I got a wife waiting
for me at home.

373
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:39,410
- I just came over to talk.
- I'm sorry. I guess I misunderstood.

374
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:42,208
- I guess you did.
- Just keep your voice down.

375
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:44,545
I won't bother you again.

376
00:39:45,618 --> 00:39:48,280
Here, have another one on me.

377
00:39:48,354 --> 00:39:49,878
Christ.

378
00:39:53,626 --> 00:39:56,390
Maybe you should give it a miss
for tonight.

379
00:40:05,337 --> 00:40:08,534
I don't know, it's just...

380
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:12,600
I really like this guy.
I've never felt anything...

381
00:40:12,678 --> 00:40:15,558
for anyone I've ever been with,
as a trick.

382
00:40:15,593 --> 00:40:18,439
for anyone I've ever been with,
as a trick.

383
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:21,486
It's weird.
I feel kind of confused about it.

384
00:40:21,554 --> 00:40:23,988
We were with each other
only one night...

385
00:40:24,056 --> 00:40:26,251
but I felt like
the relationship...

386
00:40:26,325 --> 00:40:30,591
I felt like there was
a relationship being formed.

387
00:40:30,663 --> 00:40:32,631
I was kind of scared.

388
00:40:35,835 --> 00:40:38,099
I don't think
I should see him again.

389
00:40:39,338 --> 00:40:41,169
But I look for him.

390
00:40:43,142 --> 00:40:47,169
I went out last night.
I was looking for him.

391
00:41:04,864 --> 00:41:06,991
Where's your car?

392
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:09,626
I sold it this morning.

393
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,338
I'm gonna take cabs from now on.

394
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:20,338
What's it tonight?
Another 500 to watch you sleep?

395
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:29,943
- What's up?
- I was looking for you tonight.

396
00:41:30,022 --> 00:41:33,924
I don't know
if you have a boyfriend...

397
00:41:33,993 --> 00:41:36,757
or a girlfriend...

398
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:40,765
but, if you have
some free time...

399
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:45,429
I thought maybe
we could get some dinner.

400
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,874
Are you serious?

401
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:54,343
I think you know I'm serious.

402
00:41:56,682 --> 00:42:01,949
I'll pay you if you like,
but I just want to see you.

403
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:16,563
I can't have dinner with you.

404
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,899
We could get prime rib.

405
00:42:25,678 --> 00:42:28,738
They've got it on sale for $2.99.

406
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:35,253
I love that dress.

407
00:43:23,302 --> 00:43:26,396
I had a really good night.

408
00:43:28,674 --> 00:43:32,110
I think things
are finally picking up.

409
00:43:32,177 --> 00:43:35,146
We made so much money.
Look.

410
00:43:35,247 --> 00:43:36,908
Come here.

411
00:43:58,003 --> 00:44:01,939
Now listen.
Do you hear?

412
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:06,435
They're talking about me.

413
00:44:23,162 --> 00:44:25,562
Are you all right?

414
00:44:34,473 --> 00:44:35,872
Get out.

415
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:48,979
Do not come back here.
I'll not see you again.

416
00:45:56,989 --> 00:45:59,583
Do you still wanna have dinner?

417
00:46:37,296 --> 00:46:40,390
I think I put too much salt on it.

418
00:46:42,301 --> 00:46:45,065
- It's not good.
- It's good.

419
00:46:52,845 --> 00:46:58,249
- Why are you a drunk?
- Why am I a drunk?

420
00:46:58,317 --> 00:47:00,842
Is that really
what you want to ask me?

421
00:47:06,658 --> 00:47:11,254
Then this is our first date
or our last.

422
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:13,764
Until now,
I wasn't sure it was either.

423
00:47:17,469 --> 00:47:19,767
First.

424
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:21,772
It's our first.

425
00:47:23,275 --> 00:47:25,743
I just wanna know.

426
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:28,438
Why are you killing yourself?

427
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:31,880
Interesting choice of words.

428
00:47:33,952 --> 00:47:39,049
I don't remember.
I just know that I want to.

429
00:47:39,124 --> 00:47:41,592
Is your drinking a way
to kill yourself?

430
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,523
- Or killing myself is a way to drink.
- Very clever.

431
00:47:43,558 --> 00:47:45,386
- Or killing myself is a way to drink.
- Very clever.

432
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:50,600
Shoot.

433
00:47:52,638 --> 00:47:54,572
Can I have another one?

434
00:48:16,762 --> 00:48:20,220
What are you thinking?
Are you angry?

435
00:48:46,525 --> 00:48:48,356
Good night.

436
00:48:51,964 --> 00:48:56,230
- I had the most wonderful...
- Why don't you stay at my place tonight?

437
00:48:58,303 --> 00:49:01,295
Look, you're pretty drunk.

438
00:49:01,373 --> 00:49:07,243
- I like you. I trust you.
- Wow. That's astonishing, Sera.

439
00:49:07,312 --> 00:49:09,780
I hate to think of you
in that cheesy motel.

440
00:49:09,848 --> 00:49:13,614
I'll move to a real smart hotel tomorrow
if it makes you feel better.

441
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:20,057
Let's talk about tomorrow.
Do you want to do something?

442
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:24,060
We'll talk about it tonight
at my place.

443
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:29,298
I'm not much good in the sack.

444
00:49:30,936 --> 00:49:33,370
It's not about sex.

445
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:35,872
I'll make you up a bed
on the sofa.

446
00:49:35,941 --> 00:49:39,502
We'll talk till late.
We'll sleep till late.

447
00:49:39,578 --> 00:49:42,479
As you know,
I am my own boss.

448
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:48,075
Do it, Ben.

449
00:49:54,593 --> 00:49:56,220
I'll do it.

450
00:50:16,948 --> 00:50:19,542
This is the home of an angel.

451
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:24,550
- Are you okay?
- Of course.

452
00:50:26,992 --> 00:50:30,086
You look extremely beautiful.

453
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,195
I do?

454
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,749
It's really weird because...

455
00:50:53,852 --> 00:50:55,581
you know...

456
00:50:55,687 --> 00:50:58,417
it's just like
this thing's happening...

457
00:50:58,523 --> 00:51:00,457
really quickly.

458
00:51:02,194 --> 00:51:04,754
I just don't know
what's going on.

459
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:08,630
Just the second I met him,
and the way I said my name.

460
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:13,069
I just said, "Hi, my name's Sera,"
and that's not what I do.

461
00:51:13,138 --> 00:51:15,732
And it's just...

462
00:51:15,807 --> 00:51:18,401
It's all happening really quickly.

463
00:51:18,477 --> 00:51:22,379
I just felt like
we've been together for a long time.

464
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:25,541
It just felt so easy...

465
00:51:25,617 --> 00:51:28,882
and I felt like...

466
00:51:28,987 --> 00:51:31,421
I felt like I was me.

467
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:33,924
I didn't feel like I was...

468
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,923
trying to be somebody else.

469
00:52:01,853 --> 00:52:04,515
When is your rent coming up
at the motel?

470
00:52:04,623 --> 00:52:06,557
What do you mean?

471
00:52:08,627 --> 00:52:14,224
I think you should go
and bring all your stuff over here.

472
00:52:21,406 --> 00:52:25,342
- Sera, you are crazy.
- So?

473
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:28,777
Don't you think you'll get
a little bored living with a drunk?

474
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:36,382
- That's what I want.
- You haven't seen the worst of it.

475
00:52:36,488 --> 00:52:39,855
These last few days,
I've been very controlled.

476
00:52:39,925 --> 00:52:44,021
I knock things over
and throw up all the time.

477
00:52:47,432 --> 00:52:51,368
Right now I feel really good.

478
00:52:54,406 --> 00:52:59,469
You're like an antidote that mixes
with the liquor and keeps me in balance.

479
00:52:59,544 --> 00:53:02,775
But that won't last forever.

480
00:53:09,788 --> 00:53:12,086
All right,
you go back to your motel.

481
00:53:12,157 --> 00:53:15,991
I'll go back to my glamorous life
of being alone.

482
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:23,558
The only thing I have to come home to
is a bottle of mouthwash...

483
00:53:23,635 --> 00:53:26,103
to take the taste
of come out of my mouth.

484
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:32,733
I'm tired of being alone.
That's what I'm tired of.

485
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:57,834
Don't you like me, Ben?

486
00:54:01,673 --> 00:54:04,642
What you don't understand is...
No. See? No.

487
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:06,404
What?

488
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:15,375
You can never, never...

489
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:17,887
ask me to stop drinking.

490
00:54:19,457 --> 00:54:22,187
Do you understand?

491
00:54:24,462 --> 00:54:26,726
I do.

492
00:54:26,544 --> 00:54:28,273
I really do.

493
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,733
I'm nuts about you.

494
00:55:29,707 --> 00:55:31,265
We didn't know...

495
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:33,843
- whether to call the police.
- He has been here about half an hour.

496
00:55:33,945 --> 00:55:38,211
- I know that...
- Mickey had seen you two together.

497
00:55:38,282 --> 00:55:41,547
I wasn't opening the door.
I don't know who, I don't know where...

498
00:55:41,619 --> 00:55:44,884
I don't know what,
I don't know whatever these days.

499
00:55:44,956 --> 00:55:50,519
He's my friend. I'm sorry.
He must have had too much to drink.

500
00:55:50,595 --> 00:55:55,362
That's why I had him patch the key code.
Because he's not gonna do it.

501
00:55:55,433 --> 00:55:57,196
I'll help him inside.
Thank you so much.

502
00:55:57,268 --> 00:55:59,361
- I'm so sorry to bother you.
- No trouble.

503
00:55:59,437 --> 00:56:02,873
You just give me a call
if you need any help.

504
00:56:02,974 --> 00:56:05,636
Ben, can you wake up?

505
00:56:10,982 --> 00:56:15,180
We gotta go inside,
but I have some presents for you.

506
00:56:15,253 --> 00:56:16,743
Up we go.

507
00:56:19,157 --> 00:56:21,352
- Here we go.
- This is Mrs. Van Houten.

508
00:56:21,425 --> 00:56:23,017
This is Ben.

509
00:56:23,094 --> 00:56:24,652
Outstanding, sir.

510
00:56:24,729 --> 00:56:27,493
All right.
Here we go.

511
00:56:27,565 --> 00:56:29,328
- You're okay?
- I'm fine.

512
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,164
- Good.
- I'm so sorry to bother you.

513
00:56:32,236 --> 00:56:35,171
- Thank you for being so nice.
- Sure.

514
00:56:35,273 --> 00:56:38,208
- All right.
- Bye-bye.

515
00:56:40,778 --> 00:56:44,077
Sorry.
I was miles away.

516
00:56:45,783 --> 00:56:47,216
The gifts.

517
00:56:50,288 --> 00:56:52,222
I love that name.

518
00:56:55,927 --> 00:56:59,863
Before we proceed onwards,
there's something I have to say.

519
00:57:04,268 --> 00:57:08,864
I've come this far.
Here I am, in your house.

520
00:57:10,141 --> 00:57:14,601
- Let me pay this month's rent.
- Why?

521
00:57:15,713 --> 00:57:17,203
Because...

522
00:57:18,316 --> 00:57:21,444
Because it's better for me
that way.

523
00:57:28,426 --> 00:57:33,090
I'll tell you right now...

524
00:57:33,164 --> 00:57:35,325
I'm in love with you.

525
00:57:40,905 --> 00:57:44,534
But, be that as it may,
I am not here...

526
00:57:44,642 --> 00:57:49,409
to force my twisted soul
into your life.

527
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,880
I know that.

528
00:57:51,949 --> 00:57:54,713
We both know I'm a drunk.

529
00:57:56,821 --> 00:57:58,880
And I know you're a hooker.

530
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:02,851
I hope you understand
that I'm a person...

531
00:58:02,927 --> 00:58:05,521
who is totally
at ease with this...

532
00:58:05,596 --> 00:58:09,828
which is not to say that
I'm indifferent or I don't care.

533
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,027
I do.

534
00:58:12,103 --> 00:58:16,164
It simply means I trust
and accept your judgment.

535
00:58:18,109 --> 00:58:21,340
I was really worried
about how that would be...

536
00:58:21,412 --> 00:58:24,176
but now I'm not.

537
00:58:29,353 --> 00:58:31,685
But you should know that included
with the rent around here...

538
00:58:31,756 --> 00:58:33,883
is a complimentary blow job.

539
00:58:37,728 --> 00:58:40,094
I suppose sooner or later
we ought to fuck.

540
00:58:42,566 --> 00:58:44,500
Whatever that means.

541
00:58:47,171 --> 00:58:50,265
- Open your presents.
- Presents!

542
00:58:53,944 --> 00:58:55,377
All right.

543
00:58:57,081 --> 00:58:59,049
Open this one first.

544
00:59:08,326 --> 00:59:10,351
Very nice.

545
00:59:12,496 --> 00:59:15,363
This should go very nicely
with my suit...

546
00:59:15,433 --> 00:59:17,628
which, by the way,
is the only item of clothing...

547
00:59:17,702 --> 00:59:21,138
I brought over
from the motel with me.

548
00:59:21,205 --> 00:59:23,867
Right.
The suitcase was clinking.

549
00:59:23,974 --> 00:59:25,839
What did you do
with your clothes?

550
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:29,903
I threw them out,
which was perhaps immoral...

551
00:59:30,014 --> 00:59:32,847
but I wanted to come to you clean,
so to speak.

552
00:59:32,917 --> 00:59:36,011
Thought we'd go shopping
for a pair of jeans...

553
00:59:36,087 --> 00:59:41,286
and 45 pairs of underwear,
and just throw one out each day.

554
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:44,157
That's nice talk, Ben.
Keep drinking.

555
00:59:44,228 --> 00:59:49,825
Between the 101-proof breath
and the occasional drool...

556
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:52,664
some interesting words
fall from your mouth.

557
01:00:20,698 --> 01:00:23,792
It looks like
I'm with the right girl.

558
01:00:26,704 --> 01:00:29,605
I'm very impressed
you would buy this for me.

559
01:00:34,512 --> 01:00:37,174
I'm gonna fill it right now.

560
01:00:38,749 --> 01:00:40,683
Do you want
to go gambling tonight?

561
01:00:40,751 --> 01:00:45,518
I was thinking we could go
and just play for a few hours.

562
01:00:46,757 --> 01:00:49,487
I hadn't planned to gamble...

563
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,824
but if you could keep
the bulk of my money...

564
01:00:51,896 --> 01:00:57,163
I could safely blow
a couple hundred bucks.

565
01:00:57,234 --> 01:00:59,725
Giving you money
makes me want to come.

566
01:01:05,609 --> 01:01:07,042
Then come.

567
01:01:49,086 --> 01:01:50,519
I'm sorry.

568
01:01:52,756 --> 01:01:54,621
I love you.

569
01:02:11,275 --> 01:02:15,041
- You got a 13.
- Hit me.

570
01:02:15,112 --> 01:02:18,809
- Wait. She's got a seven.
- I don't know. You tell me.

571
01:02:18,883 --> 01:02:23,343
- Hit.
- I'm busted. That's all right.

572
01:02:47,244 --> 01:02:50,805
You got it.
You can do it.

573
01:02:50,915 --> 01:02:54,351
Wait a minute!
Really? Oh, man!

574
01:02:54,418 --> 01:02:55,851
- What?
- He's okay.

575
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,354
Do you want anything?

576
01:02:58,422 --> 01:03:03,485
Yeah, maybe a Bloody Mary.
Can you make that?

577
01:03:03,561 --> 01:03:05,324
What?

578
01:03:08,899 --> 01:03:11,663
Fuck you! Fuck!
You fucker!

579
01:03:16,907 --> 01:03:20,775
That boy is...
You can't judge me!

580
01:03:20,878 --> 01:03:24,439
You! I am his father!

581
01:03:24,548 --> 01:03:25,981
Get up!

582
01:03:28,886 --> 01:03:30,649
Let's go, guys.

583
01:05:18,729 --> 01:05:20,822
How are you?

584
01:05:20,898 --> 01:05:22,331
Very well.

585
01:05:25,402 --> 01:05:28,667
I never expected
to have to ask this again...

586
01:05:28,739 --> 01:05:31,003
but how did our evening go?

587
01:05:34,611 --> 01:05:37,546
I remember getting
to the casino.

588
01:05:39,283 --> 01:05:44,380
And I remember kissing you.
That was really nice.

589
01:05:45,789 --> 01:05:47,882
And then playing blackjack...

590
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:50,017
and then security came.

591
01:05:50,094 --> 01:05:54,724
But after that, everything's a blank.
What happened?

592
01:05:54,798 --> 01:05:58,029
They wanted to carry you out
and dump you onto the street...

593
01:05:58,102 --> 01:06:02,061
but I talked them
into letting me walk you out.

594
01:06:02,139 --> 01:06:05,472
That's impressive.

595
01:06:05,542 --> 01:06:07,476
How did you do that?

596
01:06:10,414 --> 01:06:12,848
I told them
that you were an alcoholic...

597
01:06:14,952 --> 01:06:17,011
and that I would take you home...

598
01:06:18,522 --> 01:06:21,923
and that we would never
go in there ever again.

599
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:28,964
"We"?

600
01:06:40,811 --> 01:06:43,109
That's amazing.

601
01:06:43,213 --> 01:06:45,238
What are you?

602
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:51,151
Some sort of angel visiting me
from one of my drunk fantasies?

603
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:55,788
How can you be so good?

604
01:06:59,329 --> 01:07:01,797
I don't know
what you're saying.

605
01:07:06,136 --> 01:07:09,196
I'm just using you.

606
01:07:09,273 --> 01:07:11,639
I need you.

607
01:07:15,179 --> 01:07:19,138
Can we not talk about it anymore?
Not a word.

608
01:07:23,053 --> 01:07:24,520
You go back to sleep...

609
01:07:24,621 --> 01:07:28,682
and I'll go out
and get us some breakfast.

610
01:07:28,759 --> 01:07:32,251
- Will you be careful?
- Don't worry.

611
01:07:48,779 --> 01:07:51,373
Ben, I'm working tonight.

612
01:07:55,118 --> 01:07:56,710
I know.

613
01:08:13,437 --> 01:08:17,373
I fuckin' talk all the time
because you never fuckin' listen to me!

614
01:08:17,441 --> 01:08:20,933
- So fuck you!
- Shut the fuck up.

615
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:27,844
I'd like a beer
and a double Kamikaze, please.

616
01:08:29,553 --> 01:08:33,353
We mustn't kick the bar.
We lean into the bar.

617
01:08:33,423 --> 01:08:35,687
Just lean into the railing.

618
01:08:36,927 --> 01:08:40,363
It's not vino veritaz.
It's en vino veritaz.

619
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:42,489
Who the fuck are you talking to?

620
01:08:42,566 --> 01:08:47,333
Little brown-nosed gnomes
with a slingshot.

621
01:08:52,075 --> 01:08:56,842
- To be in drunk.
- Lean into the bar?

622
01:08:56,947 --> 01:08:59,245
You lean into the bar.

623
01:09:00,784 --> 01:09:04,311
My boyfriend over there
is really boring the shit out of me...

624
01:09:04,388 --> 01:09:06,788
and I was wondering
if you would buy me a drink?

625
01:09:06,857 --> 01:09:09,417
Do you mind
if I buy her a drink?

626
01:09:09,493 --> 01:09:14,692
- I don't care what you do with her.
- I'll have a rum and Coke, please.

627
01:09:14,765 --> 01:09:17,131
Barman, a rum and Coke.

628
01:09:21,204 --> 01:09:24,332
Can I stay with you for awhile?

629
01:09:24,408 --> 01:09:28,310
You mean move in with me?
Isn't this a bit sudden?

630
01:09:28,412 --> 01:09:31,848
I don't have a lot of things.

631
01:09:31,915 --> 01:09:35,851
I don't think my wife
would dig it very much.

632
01:09:35,919 --> 01:09:41,585
Then maybe we should just go
to a motel and fuck all day.

633
01:09:41,658 --> 01:09:44,752
I could suck you like this.

634
01:09:44,828 --> 01:09:47,422
I'm sure fucking you
would be wonderful...

635
01:09:47,497 --> 01:09:52,434
but it's almost impossible for me
to imagine being with someone else.

636
01:09:52,502 --> 01:09:56,336
Now listen, asshole,
I'm not just gonna sit here...

637
01:09:56,406 --> 01:09:58,670
and watch her suck on your ear!

638
01:09:58,742 --> 01:10:01,176
Shut the fuck up!

639
01:10:07,784 --> 01:10:09,718
I am sorry...

640
01:10:09,786 --> 01:10:13,586
but she and I have decided to spend
a few hours together...

641
01:10:13,724 --> 01:10:15,783
in a motel.

642
01:10:15,892 --> 01:10:18,258
And after that, caviar.

643
01:10:22,199 --> 01:10:23,962
Baby, wait up!

644
01:10:31,541 --> 01:10:34,476
You're quite a fighter.

645
01:10:34,544 --> 01:10:36,637
Here.

646
01:10:36,713 --> 01:10:40,809
Listen,
this may sound silly...

647
01:10:40,884 --> 01:10:42,818
but I have to ask you
to leave.

648
01:10:42,886 --> 01:10:46,219
It's what we do around here
when there's a fight.

649
01:10:46,289 --> 01:10:48,314
The men's room
is around the back.

650
01:10:56,233 --> 01:10:58,326
Sexy.

651
01:11:02,739 --> 01:11:04,172
I'm back.

652
01:11:07,411 --> 01:11:09,675
Oh, my God.

653
01:11:09,746 --> 01:11:12,306
- Did I scare you?
- What happened?

654
01:11:14,251 --> 01:11:16,845
Fuck, Ben.
Did you get in a fight?

655
01:11:18,255 --> 01:11:20,280
I thought you said
you didn't fight.

656
01:11:21,558 --> 01:11:23,958
How do you feel?

657
01:11:24,027 --> 01:11:28,123
Like the kling-klang king
of the rim-ram room.

658
01:11:28,198 --> 01:11:30,132
Did you stop at a bar?

659
01:11:31,468 --> 01:11:33,959
Did you say something stupid
to somebody stupid?

660
01:11:34,037 --> 01:11:35,971
Absolutely not.

661
01:11:37,541 --> 01:11:41,671
I was defending the honor
of some poor wayward maiden.

662
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,814
I bet you were.

663
01:11:50,053 --> 01:11:54,012
Why don't you go take a shower
and put on your other shirt?

664
01:11:54,091 --> 01:11:57,822
Then we'll go shopping
and buy you some new clothes.

665
01:11:57,894 --> 01:12:00,328
I think this shirt is unlucky.

666
01:12:02,065 --> 01:12:03,828
Not at all.

667
01:12:04,901 --> 01:12:06,835
Your blood tastes good.

668
01:12:10,073 --> 01:12:12,132
We got eggs.

669
01:12:12,209 --> 01:12:15,838
I always had a fantasy
of being a flamenco dancer.

670
01:12:18,081 --> 01:12:19,605
I think you look great.

671
01:12:19,683 --> 01:12:21,617
We'll just get you a bow tie...

672
01:12:21,685 --> 01:12:24,779
and then you can be one
of those blackjack dealers.

673
01:12:24,855 --> 01:12:27,619
- All right?
- They wear it because they have to.

674
01:12:27,724 --> 01:12:30,420
I'll wear it
because I want to...

675
01:12:30,527 --> 01:12:32,791
which will make me
look different.

676
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:38,460
Let's get a drink!

677
01:12:40,036 --> 01:12:41,469
- What is that?
- What?

678
01:12:41,538 --> 01:12:46,168
Holy cow.
It came out of your ear!

679
01:12:47,911 --> 01:12:49,845
I didn't have time
to write you a card...

680
01:12:49,913 --> 01:12:52,313
with you breathing down
my neck all day...

681
01:12:52,382 --> 01:12:54,509
so you'll just have
to wing it, baby.

682
01:12:55,919 --> 01:12:57,352
Open it.

683
01:13:08,431 --> 01:13:11,491
They're your color.

684
01:13:11,568 --> 01:13:14,264
I think you should wear
one of them at a time.

685
01:13:14,337 --> 01:13:17,670
One of these
and one of your other ones.

686
01:13:17,741 --> 01:13:21,108
I was gonna buy you just one...

687
01:13:21,178 --> 01:13:23,305
but I didn't think it would fly.

688
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:25,974
Nurse!
As a gift, I mean.

689
01:13:32,022 --> 01:13:34,388
I'll wear them tonight.

690
01:13:36,026 --> 01:13:37,584
One of them.

691
01:13:43,867 --> 01:13:45,960
Tonight.

692
01:13:46,036 --> 01:13:47,799
Put it on.

693
01:13:54,344 --> 01:13:57,177
I can't get it.

694
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:59,181
I'll help you.

695
01:14:03,887 --> 01:14:08,517
You'll be able to feel it,
sharp and hot under your ear...

696
01:14:08,625 --> 01:14:12,026
as one of the brothers
is putting your head facedown...

697
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:15,531
into one
of the penthouse pillows.

698
01:14:52,569 --> 01:14:54,002
Wait!

699
01:14:58,642 --> 01:15:01,338
Maybe you should wait.

700
01:15:04,114 --> 01:15:07,811
- Why?
- You can tell.

701
01:15:07,884 --> 01:15:09,818
She really wants you to.

702
01:15:30,307 --> 01:15:32,298
Maybe I should
follow you around...

703
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:37,210
and ask one of your tricks
what it's like to sleep with you.

704
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,214
They wouldn't know.

705
01:15:42,752 --> 01:15:45,016
Maybe you should ask me
sometime.

706
01:15:45,088 --> 01:15:47,352
Be happy to show you.

707
01:15:50,427 --> 01:15:53,624
I'm gonna be home around 3:00.

708
01:15:53,697 --> 01:15:57,064
If you're back, we could
watch some TV or something.

709
01:16:00,103 --> 01:16:04,369
What I'm saying is that I hope
you're back when I get home.

710
01:16:07,744 --> 01:16:09,905
Be careful.

711
01:16:11,781 --> 01:16:14,909
You be careful too.

712
01:16:14,984 --> 01:16:17,452
I'm gonna miss you.

713
01:16:24,661 --> 01:16:28,097
I know this really cool place
in the desert.

714
01:16:28,164 --> 01:16:30,098
We could go away
for a couple days.

715
01:16:33,903 --> 01:16:35,432
I'd like that.

716
01:16:35,467 --> 01:16:36,962
I'd like that.

717
01:16:51,087 --> 01:16:54,523
I make comic faces and...

718
01:16:54,591 --> 01:16:58,118
stand on my head and grin at you
between my legs and...

719
01:17:00,497 --> 01:17:02,522
I know loads of jokes.

720
01:17:05,802 --> 01:17:07,667
Wouldn't stand a chance,
would I?

721
01:17:16,446 --> 01:17:20,678
You did tell me
I ought to find myself a girl.

722
01:17:22,318 --> 01:17:24,513
I like it here with you.

723
01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:29,790
Let's stay for awhile.

724
01:18:07,764 --> 01:18:11,200
- Need a mix master.
- What?

725
01:18:11,267 --> 01:18:15,533
Just sort of take everything
and blend it all together.

726
01:20:02,245 --> 01:20:04,179
Take this off.

727
01:20:47,223 --> 01:20:49,282
- Let's go inside.
- All right.

728
01:21:02,905 --> 01:21:04,998
I want my drinky.

729
01:21:12,415 --> 01:21:15,680
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

730
01:21:22,325 --> 01:21:25,260
You're bleeding.
Wait. Hold it.

731
01:21:25,361 --> 01:21:29,798
- There's glass in here.
- I'm like a prickly pear!

732
01:21:31,367 --> 01:21:34,131
- I'm a prickly pear!
- Go inside.

733
01:21:34,203 --> 01:21:38,970
- I wanna clean up the glass.
- Go inside. I'll take care of it.

734
01:21:39,042 --> 01:21:40,805
Are you sure?

735
01:21:41,878 --> 01:21:43,470
All right.

736
01:21:56,659 --> 01:22:00,117
- Everybody okay?
- We're fine.

737
01:22:00,229 --> 01:22:02,459
I'm so sorry.
We'll pay for the table...

738
01:22:02,565 --> 01:22:06,501
- and I'll clean this up.
- Don't worry.

739
01:22:08,071 --> 01:22:10,335
You seem prepared for accidents.

740
01:22:10,406 --> 01:22:12,567
We get a lot of screw-ups here.

741
01:22:13,976 --> 01:22:18,504
You two take your loud talk
and your liquor to your room.

742
01:22:18,581 --> 01:22:20,276
You check out
first thing tomorrow.

743
01:22:20,349 --> 01:22:22,943
I don't want to see
either of you here ever again.

744
01:22:23,019 --> 01:22:25,112
Don't you worry
about paying for anything.

745
01:22:25,188 --> 01:22:28,351
And don't you worry about cutting
your little hands on the glass.

746
01:22:28,424 --> 01:22:31,120
Let's just leave it at that.

747
01:22:31,227 --> 01:22:33,957
See you in the morning.

748
01:24:01,717 --> 01:24:03,651
I'm in here, Ben.

749
01:24:10,993 --> 01:24:13,461
I bought some plain rice.

750
01:24:13,563 --> 01:24:17,055
You probably don't want
to hear it right now, but...

751
01:24:17,166 --> 01:24:19,430
I think it's something
that you could eat.

752
01:24:20,536 --> 01:24:23,096
If you get hungry,
will you let me know?

753
01:25:22,198 --> 01:25:24,792
I think I'm ready for rice.

754
01:25:40,917 --> 01:25:43,181
I want you to see a doctor.

755
01:25:55,965 --> 01:25:58,866
I'm not gonna see a doctor.

756
01:26:03,439 --> 01:26:06,704
Maybe it's time
I moved to a hotel.

757
01:26:08,611 --> 01:26:10,374
And do what?

758
01:26:11,447 --> 01:26:13,938
Rot away in a room?

759
01:26:18,955 --> 01:26:21,788
We're not gonna talk about that.

760
01:26:21,857 --> 01:26:23,791
Fuck you.

761
01:26:26,195 --> 01:26:28,129
You're staying here.

762
01:26:30,132 --> 01:26:33,829
You're not going to any motel.

763
01:26:33,903 --> 01:26:37,339
It's just one thing
you can do for me.

764
01:26:39,141 --> 01:26:41,609
That's all I ask.

765
01:26:41,677 --> 01:26:43,736
I've given you
gallons of free will.

766
01:26:43,813 --> 01:26:46,338
You can do this one thing for me!

767
01:26:57,727 --> 01:26:59,820
I have to go to work now.

768
01:27:37,233 --> 01:27:40,168
Snake eyes!

769
01:27:44,073 --> 01:27:45,734
Five!

770
01:28:16,405 --> 01:28:17,997
Boxcars!

771
01:28:34,123 --> 01:28:35,147
Five!

772
01:28:36,725 --> 01:28:39,751
- Are you in for the convention?
- What?

773
01:29:22,538 --> 01:29:24,972
You're making me really hot.

774
01:30:23,866 --> 01:30:28,667
Perhaps I could crash on the couch
for a few hours and then leave.

775
01:30:28,737 --> 01:30:30,295
Get out.

776
01:31:21,257 --> 01:31:24,749
I was wondering
how much it would cost?

777
01:31:24,827 --> 01:31:26,795
Sorry, guys.
I don't know what you mean.

778
01:31:26,862 --> 01:31:30,298
- Anyway, I only date one guy at a time.
- Wait. We got money.

779
01:31:30,366 --> 01:31:32,800
Show her the fucking money.

780
01:31:32,868 --> 01:31:35,962
- How much are you willing to spend?
- How much do you want?

781
01:31:36,038 --> 01:31:38,472
Two hundred for an hour?

782
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:41,168
- Don't your friends talk?
- Sure.

783
01:31:50,653 --> 01:31:53,121
- Get this on camera.
- Smile.

784
01:31:58,627 --> 01:32:00,754
- How you doin'?
- I'm fine.

785
01:32:00,863 --> 01:32:04,060
- Do you want something to drink?
- I'm fine. Where's the money?

786
01:32:04,166 --> 01:32:05,599
Money.

787
01:32:08,404 --> 01:32:10,167
Twenty, forty, sixty,
eighty, a hundred.

788
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:13,265
- Get it on camera, dude.
- Two hundred dollars.

789
01:32:16,312 --> 01:32:19,645
- All right, who's first?
- Hold on a second.

790
01:32:19,715 --> 01:32:22,650
Miser! You've gotta get him
on camera when he comes out.

791
01:32:22,718 --> 01:32:25,448
- Come on.
- Look, you two go downstairs.

792
01:32:25,521 --> 01:32:27,455
I'll be half an hour
and then...

793
01:32:27,523 --> 01:32:29,855
The only thing is,
we really wanna get him on tape.

794
01:32:29,925 --> 01:32:32,086
This is his first time.
Come on, Miser!

795
01:32:32,194 --> 01:32:34,662
We just wanna see him.

796
01:32:46,075 --> 01:32:50,808
- Ask her the question, man.
- Ask her. Come on, ask her.

797
01:32:52,281 --> 01:32:56,149
- I wanna fuck you up the butt.
- Nobody's doing any of that.

798
01:32:56,218 --> 01:32:59,483
You're all going straight,
one at a time, and then I'm outta here.

799
01:32:59,555 --> 01:33:00,988
- You hear me?
- Ask again.

800
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:04,457
- How much to fuck you up the butt?
- He said it again!

801
01:33:04,526 --> 01:33:07,984
- I wanna fuck you up the butt.
- Fuck one of your friends in the butt.

802
01:33:09,198 --> 01:33:13,134
- I'm outta here.
- Wait. What did she say?

803
01:33:13,235 --> 01:33:15,328
- Get out of my fuckin' way.
- What did you say? Hold on.

804
01:33:15,404 --> 01:33:18,771
- Get the fuck out of my way!
- Don't fuckin' push me!

805
01:33:19,875 --> 01:33:22,673
What the fuck is your problem?

806
01:33:24,646 --> 01:33:28,082
Look, I'm really sorry, guys.
Let's just calm down.

807
01:33:28,150 --> 01:33:30,710
I'm sorry.
Just calm down.

808
01:33:34,323 --> 01:33:38,089
- Fuck, Miser.
- Shit.

809
01:33:40,229 --> 01:33:41,696
- Shit.
- Fuck.

810
01:34:30,946 --> 01:34:32,379
Where you headed?

811
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:34,916
421 Vista.

812
01:34:37,453 --> 01:34:41,446
I couldn't help but notice
you had a little trouble sittin' down.

813
01:34:41,523 --> 01:34:44,583
You get a back door delivery
you weren't expectin'?

814
01:34:47,996 --> 01:34:51,261
You gonna be able
to pay for this?

815
01:34:51,333 --> 01:34:55,269
I asked you a question.
You got money?

816
01:34:56,505 --> 01:35:00,100
- I'll let you out here, sister.
- I have money.

817
01:35:00,175 --> 01:35:04,441
All right.
Don't take it out on me.

818
01:35:04,546 --> 01:35:07,310
I'm just covering my ass.

819
01:35:07,382 --> 01:35:09,976
Somethin' maybe you should have
thought about doing.

820
01:35:26,034 --> 01:35:28,127
Get her, Miser.

821
01:35:28,203 --> 01:35:29,636
Here, I got her.

822
01:35:35,644 --> 01:35:37,236
Fuckin' bite me.

823
01:36:00,536 --> 01:36:03,198
- Who is it?
- Mrs. Van Houten.

824
01:36:12,114 --> 01:36:16,210
I am sorry, but we have to ask you
to be out by the end of the week.

825
01:37:44,072 --> 01:37:46,973
I'm sorry, ma'am.
He hasn't checked back in.

826
01:38:08,930 --> 01:38:12,559
What is your problem?
You're on strike?

827
01:38:29,885 --> 01:38:31,318
Out.

828
01:38:32,721 --> 01:38:35,019
What's the problem?

829
01:38:35,090 --> 01:38:38,787
We don't want you in here.
That's the problem.

830
01:38:38,860 --> 01:38:40,794
Come on. Let's go.

831
01:38:40,862 --> 01:38:44,798
Let go of my arm.
If you want me outta here...

832
01:38:44,866 --> 01:38:48,302
- I don't wanna be outta here.
- You're going out.

833
01:38:51,707 --> 01:38:54,801
Next time it won't be
so fuckin' easy.

834
01:39:28,009 --> 01:39:32,708
It ain't none of my business,
but what in the hell happened to you?

835
01:39:32,814 --> 01:39:37,478
I had an argument.

836
01:39:37,552 --> 01:39:39,782
Must have been
a hell of an argument.

837
01:39:39,855 --> 01:39:42,153
If I was you, I'd leave him.

838
01:39:42,224 --> 01:39:44,124
A pretty,
young lady like you...

839
01:39:45,393 --> 01:39:49,056
You can get any man you want.
Don't you know that?

840
01:40:23,165 --> 01:40:25,599
Where the fuck are you?

841
01:40:30,839 --> 01:40:33,273
Give me the address.

842
01:41:17,285 --> 01:41:19,378
It's so dark in here.

843
01:41:38,139 --> 01:41:40,972
You're so sick...

844
01:41:41,042 --> 01:41:42,737
so pale.

845
01:41:44,813 --> 01:41:46,747
My love.

846
01:41:47,983 --> 01:41:49,917
You're my love.

847
01:41:54,322 --> 01:41:56,722
Do you want help?

848
01:42:02,330 --> 01:42:05,265
Do you want my help?

849
01:42:09,337 --> 01:42:11,771
I want to see you.

850
01:42:14,843 --> 01:42:17,437
You're my angel.

851
01:42:18,947 --> 01:42:20,881
I'm right here.

852
01:42:29,257 --> 01:42:31,191
What happened?

853
01:42:34,796 --> 01:42:39,233
Something went wrong,
but I'm okay.

854
01:42:42,804 --> 01:42:45,898
I'm sorry I put us asunder.

855
01:42:45,974 --> 01:42:47,407
It's okay.

856
01:43:27,115 --> 01:43:29,049
Let me do it.

857
01:43:34,289 --> 01:43:38,191
There. There you go.

858
01:43:47,135 --> 01:43:50,400
See how hard
you make me, angel?

859
01:44:29,110 --> 01:44:31,101
You know I love you.

860
01:44:37,952 --> 01:44:39,442
I know.

861
01:45:16,624 --> 01:45:18,558
I love you.

862
01:46:18,052 --> 01:46:21,419
I think the thing is...

863
01:46:21,489 --> 01:46:25,391
we both realized that
we didn't have that much time...

864
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:28,395
and...

865
01:46:28,496 --> 01:46:33,559
I accepted him for who he was.

866
01:46:35,236 --> 01:46:38,399
I didn't expect him to change.

867
01:46:38,473 --> 01:46:43,137
I think he felt that for me too.

868
01:46:46,014 --> 01:46:48,141
I liked his drama.

869
01:46:51,352 --> 01:46:53,286
And he needed me.

870
01:46:56,758 --> 01:46:58,692
I loved him.
