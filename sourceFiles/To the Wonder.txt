1
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,340
My sweet love.

2
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:38,013
At last.

3
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,910
My hope.

4
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,881
How I loved you.

5
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:53,274
How long have you been here?

6
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,777
- A couple of months.
- Oh.

7
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:58,904
How do you like it so far?

8
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:00,739
I like it.

9
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,077
- And do you have any children?
- I have a daughter.

10
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,205
She's ten.

11
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,000
I bet it's hard being a single mum.

12
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,294
I know my daughter's a little younger,

13
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:15,921
but it would be fun for them
to get together maybe.

14
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:19,091
It's kind of a hard age to move away.

15
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:04,775
- What's going on here?
- We're doing a little remedial work.

16
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,277
Remedial work?

17
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:10,072
We're looking to make sure
there's no toxins.

18
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,366
I got stuff on my house.

19
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,493
Kids acting strange.

20
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:21,458
Sometimes we see tar
coming out of the cracks in the patio.

21
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:26,213
The neighbours here,
they had their house in escrow.

22
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:28,382
They pulled out.

23
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:32,135
- The buyers pulled out.
- Yeah.

24
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,473
That's too bad.

25
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:40,477
The reports from the lab came in.

26
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:44,064
It showed the presence of lead
and cadmium in the surface soil

27
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,984
and in the dust in the school-yards.

28
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:30,253
I've had it blonde

29
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:32,881
and brown and pink and red.

30
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:37,719
Me, I could never dye my hair,
unless my mum says I can.

31
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:41,765
My mum doesn't care.
My mum's pretty cool.

32
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,748
Of course.

33
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:45,514
There is a love

34
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:51,186
that's like a stream that goes dry
when rain no longer feeds it.

35
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,272
But there is a love

36
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:57,901
that is like a spring
coming up from the earth.

37
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:01,196
The first is human love,
the second is divine love

38
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,740
and has its source above.

39
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:10,539
The husband is to love his wife
as Christ loved the church,

40
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:12,791
and give his life for her.

41
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:18,672
He does not <i>find</i> her lovely,
he <i>makes</i> her lovely.

42
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,759
But there is a grace
that comes in such a marriage.

43
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,720
I got married when I was 17.

44
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:29,683
I had a child.

45
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:35,480
But my husband
started running after other women.

46
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:39,484
He left us and went
to the Canary Islands.

47
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:44,781
Other priests have told me
that in the eyes of the church

48
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:47,868
I'm still married to that man.

49
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,748
They said I couldn't have
the sacraments.

50
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:01,548
I want to be a wife.

51
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:22,903
I don't even know
why I was with him in the first place.

52
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:27,032
And then it sunk in.

53
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:34,289
I didn't really want to tell my dad,
because I knew he would start yelling,

54
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:36,583
yelling very loudly, and...

55
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,378
I'd never give her up.

56
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,714
Ever.

57
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,652
You see that red band
in the sky right there?

58
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:40,280
And you see that blue down below it?

59
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:43,324
That's the earth's shadow
on the atmosphere.

60
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:47,996
Look. You see
what I'm talking about?

61
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:50,790
Stop for a second.
You see?

62
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:19,235
Tatiana...

63
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:59,836
Father,
I'm going to pray for you.

64
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:01,796
Thank you very much.

65
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:05,007
So you will receive the gift of joy.

66
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,136
Me?

67
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,014
Because you're so unhappy.

68
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,899
Do you get lonely all the time,
or most of the time

69
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:23,818
when there ain't nobody around?

70
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:30,116
So, what you got to say about it?

71
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:33,161
You gotta have a little more excitement.

72
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:36,372
Just like when me and you are around,
and there ain't nobody around.

73
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:39,000
Hey! The power hits you, brother.

74
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:42,128
It always hits me. You can just say,
hey, power, and it hits me.

75
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:43,629
Hits me before I can get it out.

76
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:50,720
See, the devil don't know what I'm saying.
And you won't know, and I won't know.

77
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:55,224
I can feel the warmth of the light, brother.

78
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:59,187
That's spiritual.
I'm feeling more than just natural light.

79
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:01,189
Feeling the spiritual light, see?

80
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:05,359
I can almost touch that light,
coming right from the sky.

81
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:15,495
The parish has grown a lot,

82
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:20,500
and we really need more room
for the community to get together.

83
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:24,795
We have plays, we have dinners,
we have parties.

84
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:29,258
We have CCD in the parish hall.

85
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,152
If I would have known it was there...

86
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:52,907
Thank you.

87
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:03,292
Everything that's happening...

88
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:51,966
Man is in revolt against God.

89
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:55,928
The prophet Hosea saw
in the breakdown of his marriage

90
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:58,764
the spiritual infidelity of his people.

91
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:03,019
In that broken marriage,
we see the pattern of our world.

92
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:06,480
We wish to live
inside the safety of the laws.

93
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:09,025
We fear to choose.

94
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,194
Jesus insists on choice.

95
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,282
The one thing he condemns utterly
is avoiding the choice.

96
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:20,077
To choose is to commit yourself,

97
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:24,707
and to commit yourself
is to run the risk of failure,

98
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:27,835
the risk of sin, the risk of betrayal,

99
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,921
but Jesus can deal with all of those.

100
00:35:31,047 --> 00:35:33,633
Forgiveness he never denies us.

101
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:37,845
The man who makes a mistake
can repent.

102
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:40,681
But the man who hesitates,

103
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:43,100
who does nothing,

104
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:47,813
who buries his talent
in the earth with him,

105
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:50,107
he can do nothing.

106
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:16,647
These guys who live around here,
they're perfectly happy

107
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:19,942
until somebody comes around
asking questions,

108
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:23,237
and it makes everybody nervous,
because...

109
00:39:25,823 --> 00:39:28,784
Ain't this is our property?
Can't we do what we want with it?

110
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:31,704
I tell my husband to get us out of here,
but where we gonna go?

111
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:41,964
They got all these big time lawyers,
and we can't get no help.

112
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:46,260
Even the dog is acting funny.

113
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,920
We've been on this house
for a long time.

114
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,467
You're out at the ranch up there?

115
00:41:52,428 --> 00:41:53,929
I've been there for some time.

116
00:41:57,016 --> 00:42:00,352
I have to look at
some of these creeks and rivers.

117
00:42:03,814 --> 00:42:06,358
You talk to my sister, right?

118
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:23,042
I'm going over
to the tall grass prairie now.

119
00:42:39,183 --> 00:42:42,436
The ranch is going into receivership.

120
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:44,897
It's going bankrupt.

121
00:42:49,193 --> 00:42:54,782
And he claimed he didn't want
to have kids while he was in school.

122
00:42:54,907 --> 00:42:56,533
She hadn't changed.

123
00:42:56,658 --> 00:43:00,496
So many student loans,
gambling debts,

124
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:03,791
and this ranch that's falling apart.

125
00:43:06,043 --> 00:43:08,378
I caught you on the right day.

126
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:12,841
Kind.

127
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:03,702
I had a child.

128
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,873
A little girl.

129
00:45:16,632 --> 00:45:18,425
She died.

130
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:23,222
My father...

131
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:25,724
he said to read Romans.

132
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,315
All things work together for good.

133
00:45:36,777 --> 00:45:38,654
He believed that.

134
00:45:41,448 --> 00:45:43,533
Will you pray with me?

135
00:45:55,504 --> 00:45:57,547
I had no faith.

136
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:04,513
You knew.

137
00:46:08,517 --> 00:46:10,519
Were you afraid?

138
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:21,280
My mother says
I'm chasing moonbeams.

139
00:46:21,405 --> 00:46:24,032
- Is that what she said?
- Mm-hmm.

140
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:32,666
I told her I'd rather have a moonbeam
than the life I had before.

141
00:46:57,399 --> 00:46:59,443
Do you want this?

142
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:07,826
Do you know what you want?

143
00:47:13,749 --> 00:47:18,170
I can't afford to make mistakes
with men any more.

144
00:47:27,012 --> 00:47:29,639
I want you to come more often.

145
00:47:30,891 --> 00:47:32,809
Can you?

146
00:47:36,897 --> 00:47:39,316
I've been waiting for you.

147
00:47:41,485 --> 00:47:43,070
I felt wild.

148
00:47:43,195 --> 00:47:45,405
- What?
- I don't know. What are you laughing at?

149
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,032
You.

150
00:47:47,157 --> 00:47:49,868
- Me?
- You make me laugh.

151
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,205
You make me happy.

152
00:48:00,212 --> 00:48:02,255
You took me.

153
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:13,725
No.

154
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:27,823
Girl.

155
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,954
Little girl.

156
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,877
Fool.

157
00:49:32,471 --> 00:49:34,431
Here I am.

158
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:47,611
Yes.

159
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:29,147
Tell her.

160
00:54:19,549 --> 00:54:21,718
I trust you.

161
00:54:37,734 --> 00:54:40,278
I want to be your wife.

162
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:53,124
I love you.

163
00:56:08,825 --> 00:56:10,827
Walk away.

164
00:56:19,794 --> 00:56:21,880
I thought I knew you.

165
00:56:27,552 --> 00:56:30,305
Now I don't think you ever were.

166
00:56:43,443 --> 00:56:45,403
What we had was nothing.

167
00:56:50,283 --> 00:56:52,744
You made it into nothing.

168
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,625
Pleasure.

169
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:04,672
Lust.

170
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,252
Ma'am, if you'll come over here.

171
00:57:43,378 --> 00:57:45,922
Sir, if you'll be on this side, please.

172
00:57:46,047 --> 00:57:48,049
Y'all have rings for each other?
OK.

173
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:51,552
To love, honour and cherish you.

174
00:57:54,055 --> 00:57:56,599
Be faithful only to you.

175
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,686
As long as we both shall live.

176
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:04,232
And I do promise
before these witnesses...

177
00:58:04,357 --> 00:58:06,651
And I do promise
before these witnesses...

178
00:58:06,776 --> 00:58:09,195
To love,
honour, and cherish you.

179
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,739
To love, honour
and cherish you.

180
00:58:11,864 --> 00:58:13,825
Be faithful only to you.

181
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:16,536
Be faithful only to you.

182
00:58:16,661 --> 00:58:18,496
As long as we both shall live.

183
00:58:19,372 --> 00:58:21,582
As long as we both shall live.

184
01:02:59,402 --> 01:03:00,861
Awaken the love.

185
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:05,992
The divine presence...

186
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:10,913
...which sleeps in each man,
each woman.

187
01:03:13,124 --> 01:03:15,459
You say,

188
01:03:15,584 --> 01:03:20,298
Christ said this, Christ said that.
What do you say?

189
01:03:22,133 --> 01:03:24,760
And what you say,

190
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:27,179
does it come from God within?

191
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:33,352
Answer that which is of God,

192
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:35,479
in every woman, every man.

193
01:03:38,024 --> 01:03:42,695
Know each other in that love
that never changes.

194
01:04:09,055 --> 01:04:11,724
I'd like to show you
here on the monitor...

195
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:17,938
This is the area of your uterus
and the IUD that you have in place there.

196
01:04:18,606 --> 01:04:22,985
We feel like one of the less risky
procedures that we can do

197
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:25,654
is to remove this device,

198
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:28,783
and see if those symptoms
don't resolve.

199
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,996
I think something that you
and your husband need to consider

200
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:36,832
is with the absence of the IUD,

201
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:40,753
is this a time that you might want
to think about children?

202
01:04:40,878 --> 01:04:43,672
Or is there another means
for contraception?

203
01:04:43,798 --> 01:04:47,426
So, I don't need to have
a hysterectomy?

204
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:49,720
That's the good news.

205
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:54,475
Thank you.

206
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:13,285
So,
would you like to have children?

207
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:17,498
Someday.

208
01:05:59,123 --> 01:06:03,127
God gave us marriage
as a holy mystery,

209
01:06:03,252 --> 01:06:06,255
in which a man and woman
are joined together

210
01:06:07,214 --> 01:06:09,300
and become one.

211
01:06:10,468 --> 01:06:13,053
And with affection and tenderness

212
01:06:13,179 --> 01:06:16,390
freely give themselves to each other.

213
01:06:17,475 --> 01:06:19,143
This ring I give you...

214
01:06:19,268 --> 01:06:22,938
Is a sign of our constant faith.

215
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:25,024
...is a sign
of our constant faith.

216
01:06:25,149 --> 01:06:27,443
And abiding love.

217
01:06:27,568 --> 01:06:29,570
And abiding love.

218
01:07:18,244 --> 01:07:19,995
Go.

219
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:20,003
We pray thy blessings
upon them,

220
01:12:20,128 --> 01:12:22,130
and upon this food
which we are about to eat.

221
01:12:29,221 --> 01:12:30,806
Would you like one?

222
01:15:00,122 --> 01:15:01,581
Come on.

223
01:15:01,707 --> 01:15:03,583
Come on, baby.

224
01:17:53,003 --> 01:17:55,297
Things have gotten worse.

225
01:18:36,087 --> 01:18:38,632
I don't understand it.
I don't know what happened. I was drunk.

226
01:18:38,757 --> 01:18:43,511
If I had done this, I'm not saying I did,
I might've, I could've.

227
01:18:46,097 --> 01:18:49,267
I'm asking for forgiveness, Father.

228
01:18:49,392 --> 01:18:51,770
I can't... I can't help...

229
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:56,691
I can't help myself. If you need me
to kneel down, I'll kneel down.

230
01:18:58,735 --> 01:19:00,237
I want to be free.

231
01:19:06,326 --> 01:19:10,580
That sun is just right in my eyes.

232
01:19:12,457 --> 01:19:16,503
I can fight, I will fight.
I can fight with my feet and hands.

233
01:19:16,628 --> 01:19:19,631
They think they're really
about something, but they ain't.

234
01:20:00,672 --> 01:20:03,717
You gonna open that bible
and preach to me now?

235
01:20:53,224 --> 01:20:56,603
Lover boy! Where are you?

236
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:15,997
Love is not only a feeling.

237
01:21:17,082 --> 01:21:19,834
Love is a duty.
You <i>shall</i> love.

238
01:21:21,586 --> 01:21:22,796
Love is a command.

239
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:27,467
And you say,
I can't command my emotions.

240
01:21:27,592 --> 01:21:29,803
They come and go like clouds.

241
01:21:30,804 --> 01:21:33,807
To that, Christ says: You shall love.

242
01:21:34,557 --> 01:21:36,976
Whether you like it or not.

243
01:21:38,395 --> 01:21:40,897
You fear your love has died.

244
01:21:44,901 --> 01:21:49,030
It perhaps is waiting to be transformed
into something higher.

245
01:23:51,611 --> 01:23:53,530
He's killing me!

246
01:23:59,786 --> 01:24:01,204
I'm sorry.

247
01:24:29,232 --> 01:24:31,401
You want me to die? Here!

248
01:24:36,364 --> 01:24:38,491
Why don't you have them?

249
01:25:12,942 --> 01:25:14,611
I'm frightened.

250
01:25:21,743 --> 01:25:22,744
OK.

251
01:26:00,573 --> 01:26:02,617
Give me your blessing, Father.

252
01:26:07,664 --> 01:26:09,791
I've hurt people.

253
01:26:16,422 --> 01:26:18,883
I know what I am.

254
01:26:25,473 --> 01:26:28,059
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

255
01:26:29,268 --> 01:26:31,145
The blood of Christ.

256
01:27:52,643 --> 01:27:54,645
I thought you went away.

257
01:33:04,455 --> 01:33:06,332
Forgive me.

258
01:33:34,527 --> 01:33:37,988
Please.

259
01:35:22,343 --> 01:35:25,804
Don't take up with anybody
during the first six months.

260
01:35:27,556 --> 01:35:29,725
Don't stop talking to people.

261
01:35:29,850 --> 01:35:33,812
That's the first mistake that I see
people make in my practice.

262
01:35:33,938 --> 01:35:37,524
Sometimes you eat the bear,
and sometimes the bear eats you.

263
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:40,194
You can't feel sorry for yourself.

264
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:43,489
Like I explained earlier,

265
01:35:43,614 --> 01:35:47,076
once we get her served
that'll start the process.

266
01:35:47,201 --> 01:35:50,412
Because there's no children involved,
this could be a fairly rapid process,

267
01:35:50,537 --> 01:35:51,914
if that's what you want.

268
01:35:53,249 --> 01:35:56,043
I don't want you to lose hope...

269
01:36:20,276 --> 01:36:21,944
It's very hard to be the...

270
01:36:23,153 --> 01:36:26,282
the one who loves less,
the one who's stronger.

271
01:36:28,742 --> 01:36:31,328
You have to struggle with yourself.

272
01:36:32,496 --> 01:36:38,294
You have to struggle
with your own... strength.

273
01:36:55,477 --> 01:36:57,187
Why?

274
01:37:15,622 --> 01:37:17,499
I saw you.

275
01:37:23,672 --> 01:37:25,632
Again.

276
01:37:34,350 --> 01:37:37,144
They are sending me away.
I won't be here for long.

277
01:37:37,269 --> 01:37:39,188
They're sending me
to western Kansas.

278
01:37:39,313 --> 01:37:42,316
Western Kansas? What are you
gonna do in western Kansas?

279
01:37:43,359 --> 01:37:46,403
A lot of people around here
are going to be missing you.

280
01:37:48,364 --> 01:37:52,159
I think we need people like you
here in Bartlesville.

281
01:37:52,284 --> 01:37:55,329
To preach the gospel.
That's why we have churches.

282
01:38:37,955 --> 01:38:40,958
I feel a lot of burning, you know.

283
01:38:41,083 --> 01:38:43,210
I have a spot here.

284
01:38:57,224 --> 01:39:02,062
I pray, but sometimes I don't hear him.
I don't think he hears me.
