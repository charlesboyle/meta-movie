1
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,183
Ladies and gentlemen...

2
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,352
...we are beginning our descent
into Berlin Tegel...

3
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,689
...where local time is 8:30 a.m. and the
temperature is a cool minus four degrees.

4
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:48,982
Morning.

5
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,276
Did you sleep?

6
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,404
No. I'll sleep at the hotel.

7
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,865
You'll do great.

8
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,202
You always do.

9
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,135
What's the purpose of your visit?

10
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:20,139
We're here for a biotechnology summit.
I'm giving a presentation.

11
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,397
Mr. and Mrs. Harris, welcome to Berlin.

12
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,274
Danke schön.

13
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,443
Next, please.

14
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,029
"I'm giving a presentation"?

15
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,574
Well, she asked.

16
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,830
- Oof. Welcome to Berlin.
- Taxi.

17
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,665
Taxi.

18
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,521
Martin, get in the car. Let him do that.

19
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,610
Oh, ya-ya.

20
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,898
What do you think he's saying?

21
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,900
No idea.

22
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,825
Look. Isabel Kronenberger is showing
here on Saturday.

23
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,160
Oh, yeah.

24
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,871
Remember when we saw her
in Chicago?

25
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,831
Yes.

26
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:17,464
Why don't I meet you there on Saturday
after my lunch with Professor Bressler?

27
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,341
Yeah.

28
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,176
If you promise.

29
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,886
I promise.

30
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,048
- Welcome to the Hotel Adlon Kempinski.
- Thank you.

31
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,551
You check in, honey.
I'll take care of this.

32
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,177
Have you stayed with us before?

33
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,555
-First time in Berlin.
-First time in Berlin.

34
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,644
If there's anything eIse l can do for you....

35
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,062
How much do I owe you?

36
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,355
Thirty-seven, sir.

37
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,775
Welcome to the Adlon Kempinski Berlin.
How may l help you, madam?

38
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:22,070
-Dr. and Mrs. Harris, the Eisenhower suite.
-Of course.

39
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,073
- Wait, wait.
- Everything okay, sir?

40
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:28,076
-Is this everything from the taxi?
-Yes, sir.

41
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:34,374
I'm afraid, Mrs. Harris, but the Eisenhower
suite may not be available right now.

42
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,917
What do you mean "not available"?

43
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,711
There have been changes,
security reasons.

44
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,756
But we confirmed two weeks ago.

45
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,799
Would you allow me
to answer the phone?

46
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,968
I'll go to the airport. l'll be back, okay?

47
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,959
Oh, please.

48
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,379
Excuse me, driver?
Is there another route?

49
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,646
Oh, come on.

50
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,288
-Look out!
-No!

51
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,541
Hello? Hello?

52
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,877
Can you hear me?

53
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,980
Dr. Farge?

54
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,527
Dr. Farge. Dr. Farge.

55
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,709
I don't speak German.

56
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,794
Are you English?

57
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,213
American.

58
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,718
You have been in an accident.

59
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,553
Accident?

60
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,141
Can you tell me your name?

61
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,394
Your name.

62
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:50,065
Martin. Martin Harris.

63
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,193
Dr. Martin Harris.

64
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,029
Where's my wife, Liz?

65
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,034
-Is she hurt? Is she hurt? Where is she?
-Calm down.

66
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,371
It's all right, Dr. Harris.
You were the only passenger.

67
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,082
The taxi you were in went into the river.

68
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,918
Your heart stopped for several minutes.

69
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:14,547
It's Thursday, November 24th.
You have been in a coma for four days.

70
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:19,761
Thanksgiving.
But my wife, she's in Berlin with me.

71
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,930
Where is she? Why isn't she here?

72
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,517
We couldn't find any identification
with you, Dr. Harris.

73
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,727
No, no, no.

74
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,562
- Please, calm down.
- Aah.

75
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:33,358
Where can we reach your wife?
Does she have a cell phone?

76
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,944
Of course she has a cell phone. It's....

77
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,907
Uh....

78
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,285
I can't remember.

79
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:48,289
Can you tell me what you do remember,
Martin?

80
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,127
Bits and pieces. Arriving at the airport.

81
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,672
Getting in a taxi with Liz...

82
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,842
...but l don't know how l got here.

83
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,137
There are no rules with severe trauma
of this kind.

84
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,264
Memories get lost or fractured.

85
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,599
Most of them return,
aIthough it's unlikely...

86
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:10,103
...you will ever fully recall the events
around your accident.

87
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,064
In the meantime, let us see
if anyone has filed a report...

88
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,983
...looking for a Martin Harris, okay?

89
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,610
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Okay.

90
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,329
From London
with Kevin Spencer and Diana Bailey.

91
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,498
Good evening.
Welcome to the BNI World News.

92
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,250
Here are today's top stories.

93
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,460
The Prime Mini--

94
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,421
Clothes. For you.

95
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,842
Has anybody been
looking for me? My wife?

96
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:42,927
Meine Frau?

97
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,337
Come here, you.

98
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,345
It's beautiful. Just beautiful.

99
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,180
I'm glad you like it.

100
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,229
She gave it to me as a gift.

101
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,440
In Paris. On our honeymoon.

102
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,861
Prince Shada arrived in Berlin today for
this year's biotechnology global summit.

103
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,405
The personal attendance
of the flamboyant prince...

104
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:29,117
...has fueled speculation that the summit,
now in its 10th year...

105
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,620
...will witness the announcement
of a major scientific breakthrough.

106
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,081
With the world's leading researchers
convening...

107
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,667
...at the luxurious Hotel Adlon
in Central Berlin...

108
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,961
-Hotel Adlon.
-...the field of biotechnology...

109
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,797
...steps into the forefront
of the media spotlight.

110
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,716
I'm here for the summit.

111
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,967
Nurse.

112
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,303
You have to realize the risk.

113
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,972
Doctor, I've been gone for four days.

114
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,309
My wife is out there in a city
she doesn't know. She'll be terrified.

115
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,644
I need to find her.

116
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,648
Sign this.

117
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,985
It releases you from my care.

118
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,279
And here's my card.

119
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:11,576
Any nausea, dizziness, difficuIty with
speech, you contact me immediately.

120
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,369
-Do you understand?
-Thank you.

121
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,720
Welcome to the Hotel Adlon Kempinski.
How may l help you?

122
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,515
Yes, hi. I'm a guest of the hotel.
I lost my room key. I need a new one.

123
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,101
-What room are you staying in?
-The Eisenhower suite.

124
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,438
-And may l have your name?
-Martin Harris. Dr. Martin Harris.

125
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,651
And may l please see some lD,
Mr. Harris?

126
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:48,529
There's been a situation.
I've lost my passport.

127
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,949
I'm going to need some lD, sir.

128
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,243
If you get someone to escort me
to my room, I can prove it.

129
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,162
Just give me a moment.

130
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,021
-Excuse me. Do you have an invitation?
-No.

131
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:26,025
I mean, yes. My name is Dr. Martin Harris.
I'm on the list.

132
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,361
-Let me check.
-l saw my wife go inside.

133
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,904
I'm trying to find her.

134
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,073
Herr Strauss?

135
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,202
-Dr. Martin Harris?
-Yes.

136
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:41,416
Yes. There you are. I'm Herr Strauss,
head of the Hotel Security.

137
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,336
Do you have any identification?
Passport, driver's license?

138
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,422
No, I don't, but--

139
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,925
-You would know him, he's over there.
-Professor Bressler!

140
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,052
- Professor Bressler!
- Sir, please.

141
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,887
He knows me.
He can confirm who I am.

142
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:59,684
-If you will be patient, sir, no problem.
-I'm being very patient.

143
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:05,356
Thank God. There she is. That's my wife,
over there by the buffet table.

144
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:13,114
I have been missing for four days and she
has no idea what happened to me...

145
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,867
...so l need you to take me to her
right now.

146
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,208
-Okay.
-Thank you.

147
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,629
-The lady in the dark dress.
-Okay.

148
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,717
Excuse me, madam.

149
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,345
Your husband is here.

150
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,975
Liz. Oh, Jesus.

151
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,645
Excuse me. Do I know you?

152
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,110
But, Liz-- What's wrong?

153
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,904
I'm sorry.

154
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:57,450
I was in an accident. I was in a coma.
They didn't know who l was.

155
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,288
I said I'm sorry.

156
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,667
Oh, you must have me confused
with someone eIse.

157
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,337
Liz.

158
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,840
It's me, Martin.

159
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,467
Your husband.

160
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,223
This is a misunderstanding.
I don't know this man.

161
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,600
-Okay.
-Martin.

162
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,020
This is my husband.

163
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,314
You are Dr. Martin Harris?

164
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,607
Last time l looked.

165
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,110
Yep, still me.

166
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,157
What's going on here?
Is this some kind of a joke?

167
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,451
Joke about what?

168
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,246
Because it's not very funny.

169
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,665
-Do you know this man?
-No.

170
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:51,295
Who the hell are you?

171
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,590
I'm her husband.

172
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,468
Okay. Okay.

173
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:01,055
Would you mind just getting him
away from us, please?

174
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,974
- Liz. Liz, stop this.
- Hey.

175
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,893
-Gentlemen, please, please, please.
-Get your hands off me.

176
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,520
- Back off.
- What's going on?

177
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,771
-Tell me.
-Back off!

178
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,274
- What's this all about?
- Why don't you take a walk?

179
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,859
Gentlemen, please.

180
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,861
-Don't touch me.
-Come on, come on!

181
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,446
If you don't leave now,
we have to call the police.

182
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,867
Call the police! Call the goddamn army!
That's a good idea!

183
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,286
What's happening?
You're embarrassing me. Please.

184
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,912
-Get him out of here.
-Liz!

185
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,082
-l must apologize. Have a nice evening.
-l was hurt!

186
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,918
- Liz! Why are you doing this to me?
- You okay?

187
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,378
Can you believe this?

188
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,838
Right there.

189
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,591
That's Liz. And l am....

190
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,764
I must've been outside.
I can't remember.

191
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,602
Well, as you can see, you are not there.

192
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:51,189
lmmigration confirms the arrival
of a Dr. and Mrs. Harris...

193
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,609
-...on November the 20th at 7:40 a.m.
-Yes.

194
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,070
At 8:50, she checked into their suite
at the hotel...

195
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,782
...followed by Dr. Harris
at 3 in the afternoon.

196
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,118
-What?
-Danke.

197
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,997
Wait. He's-- He's not Martin Harris.

198
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,958
I am Dr. Martin Harris.

199
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,295
The man upstairs is pretending
to be me.

200
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,714
And this impostor,
did he aIso steal your wife?

201
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,342
He must be forcing her or something.

202
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,136
Well, why? Help me. Why?

203
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,223
For God's sake,
just do an lnternet search.

204
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,184
There are over 400 Martin Harrises
in the United States, sir.

205
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,144
We already checked.

206
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:34,190
Rod. Rodney Cole,
a colleague at Langemore in the States.

207
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,776
A dear friend.
He can verify who l am.

208
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,778
Please, call him. It's 001 ...

209
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,326
...508-146-2595.

210
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,665
This is Dr. Cole. I'm having an....

211
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,208
Sorry, answering machine.

212
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,501
Please, leave a message.

213
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:57,004
Professor Bressler. Talk to him.
He's the reason I'm in Berlin.

214
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,674
He invited me over to the summit
to discuss my thesis.

215
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,592
-You know Professor Bressler?
-Yes.

216
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,721
Well, we haven't actually met,
but we've been speaking on the phone...

217
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,431
...e-mailing, dozens of times.

218
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,145
- Why don't you arrest him?
- For what?

219
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,773
Entering the country legally?

220
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:20,403
Presenting all the correct documentation
and sharing a hotel suite with his wife?

221
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,905
Excuse me. With your wife.

222
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,617
She is my wife.

223
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,454
Herr Strauss? l found a Dr. Martin Harris
at Langemore University.

224
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,041
Yes. Thank you.
That's what I've been trying....

225
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,213
Okay.

226
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,300
Wait, please, wait.

227
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:46,012
You're going to arrest me?
I demand to speak to my embassy.

228
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:49,557
Unfortunately, it's your Thanksgiving.
The embassy's closed until Monday.

229
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,735
Herr Strauss,
can l have a quiet word, please?

230
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,321
Okay.

231
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,992
Listen...

232
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,621
...you're probably right. I--

233
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,623
The accident.

234
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,542
I, uh--

235
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,212
I haven't been remembering things
very well. I'm confused.

236
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:24,216
This is my doctor
at the hospital here in Berlin.

237
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:29,263
He warned me that this sort of thing,
this was gonna happen.

238
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:33,267
I need to go back there now.

239
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,103
I'm so embarrassed.

240
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:43,569
So now you are saying
that you are not Dr. Martin Harris?

241
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,367
I don't know.

242
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:20,523
Wait, stop. Stop. I've changed my mind.

243
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,639
-Need passport.
-Please.

244
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,142
Please?

245
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,729
Police. Very bad.

246
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,322
This is Dr. Cole.

247
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,909
I'm having an out-of-office experience
right now. Please1 leave a message.

248
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,828
Rodney, it's me, Martin.

249
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:01,373
Listen, I'm in Berlin
for the summit, but....

250
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,001
It's Liz. She's--

251
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,254
I-- l don't know what she's doing...

252
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,465
...and there's another man involved.

253
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,718
It-- She-- She....

254
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,223
I'm in trouble, Rod. We--

255
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:19,975
Shit.

256
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,660
He says he doesn't caye
if she saved your life.

257
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:12,833
The bitch cost him 20,000 Euros.

258
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,172
The insurance won't cover the cab
as she had no license.

259
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:25,137
He says illegal immigrants
are destroying German society.

260
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,850
So I'm guessing he doesn't know
where she is.

261
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,977
No one knows where she is.

262
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,275
Well, thank him for his time.

263
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,820
Excuse me.

264
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,072
Hey, American.
I'm sorry we couldn't help you.

265
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,949
You know where she is, l can tell.

266
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,453
Look, l just wanna thank her.
She saved my life.

267
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,790
I thought maybe l could give her
some money. I just wanna thank her.

268
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,001
Please.

269
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,684
You remember me?

270
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,145
-l was in your taxi.
-l don't drive taxi.

271
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,731
I was in your taxi.

272
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,191
We crashed.

273
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,485
I need to know,
where did you pick me up?

274
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,196
-Where was I going?
-How did you find me?

275
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,405
Your friend, Biko.

276
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,786
Just leave me alone.

277
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,498
Please, help me.

278
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,000
Just leave me alone.

279
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,003
Thank you for saving me.

280
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,017
Excuse me.

281
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:58,105
I need to find Professor Bressler's lab.
I have an appointment at 1 2:30. I'm late.

282
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,775
-Your name, please?
-Dr. Martin Harris.

283
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,780
Wait here, please.

284
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,282
The professor knows who l am.

285
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,909
We scheduled this appointment
weeks ago.

286
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,602
Drake, the English botanist...

287
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,146
...who wondered how it manages
to reproduce...

288
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,733
...as it doesn't appear to attract
any insects.

289
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:46,820
Yes. One wonders how plants are
developing firm, unlike m--

290
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,785
-Bressler.
-This lab is restricted. Who are you?

291
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:58,081
This man is not Martin Harris.
I am Dr. Martin Harris.

292
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:03,462
So, what is this?
There are two Martin Harrises, huh?

293
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,005
No, let me explain.

294
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,300
This man showed up at my hotel last night
claiming to be me.

295
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:11,428
-The police were called.
-l called the police, son of a bitch!

296
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,347
He checked himself out of a hospital.

297
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,098
-He was in an accident.
-Professor.

298
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:18,769
Ja. Danke.

299
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,521
We talked, you and I, on the phone.

300
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,149
We discussed
aIternative forms of propagation.

301
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:28,820
I told you about my father,
a schooIteacher, his passion for science.

302
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,864
We talked about your children...

303
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:34,326
...about how much time you've spent
with them since you lost your wife.

304
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,870
Two girls, right?

305
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,998
You told me their names. And I....

306
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,833
I just can't....

307
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,002
I know them. l know them.

308
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,797
- Laurel.
- Laurel, Lily, twins.

309
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,715
Ten years old.

310
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:52,970
About the same age I was when l told
my father I wanted to be a botanist.

311
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:56,056
Do you remember, Professor?
We talked about that on the phone...

312
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,392
...how l'd never seen my father
this happy.

313
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,643
No, that wasn't you.

314
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,063
Don't you remember? We spoke
about how brave our wives were--

315
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,398
To marry scientists.

316
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:07,234
-l told you about our--
-Our honeymoon in Paris.

317
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,821
My wife and l. And how she wanted to visit
all the museums.

318
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,074
- All l wanted to do was go to the--
- L'Ecole Polytechnique.

319
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:18,662
But she insisted. And that's how
I first saw Leonardo's Vitruvian man.

320
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,706
Wow.

321
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,628
This is not happening.

322
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,088
STUDENT:

323
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,339
Moment, Moment.

324
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:34,094
I don't know who this man is,
but he has taken everything from me.

325
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,930
You have to arrest him.

326
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,765
Go on, arrest him.

327
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,603
I don't believe l need to do this.

328
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,512
No.

329
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,661
My friend, he...

330
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,498
...looks....

331
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,126
No, he finds people.

332
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,467
Martin.

333
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:59,304
The mistake was mine.
I should never have let you leave.

334
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,140
-What's happening to me, doctor?
-Confusion...

335
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:05,727
...memory loss,
complete or partial loss of identity.

336
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,647
These are common stages in recovery.

337
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,524
A person can awaken from a coma...

338
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:14,653
...convinced of a reality
that was previously only fantasy.

339
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,863
We are going to sedate you now...

340
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:21,034
...do another MRI,
try to find out what's going on, okay?

341
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:25,413
If I'm not Martin Harris,
why do l know so much about him?

342
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:31,503
Perhaps he was someone
you read about...

343
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,171
...or met once in passing.

344
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:38,218
Do you know what it feels like
to become insane, doctor?

345
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:43,890
It's like a war
between being told who you are...

346
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,726
...and knowing who you are.

347
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,480
Which do you think wins?

348
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:02,219
Hello, Martin. This won't take very long.

349
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,595
GRETCHEN:

350
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:46,888
SMITH:

351
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,974
GRETCHEN:

352
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,907
It's okay. I'm feeling much, much better.

353
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:19,118
And now with us,
Rebecca for the weather.

354
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:30,046
Hello?

355
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:37,554
So it's going to be
a cold night here in Central Berlin...

356
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,514
...with an overnight low
of three degrees...

357
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,892
...and a high probability of more snow
throughout tomorrow.

358
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,311
And now to the West1
to the Ruhy Valley.

359
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,506
-Herr Jörgen?
-Yeah?

360
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:21,681
You met her?

361
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,183
She looked after me in the hospital.

362
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,561
She was kind to me too.

363
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,856
I'm sorry. She's dead.

364
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:35,528
Come. Come in.

365
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,780
Thank you.

366
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:50,668
Drink?

367
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,712
No, thanks.

368
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:59,052
I was a former member of the Stasi...

369
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:02,221
...the Ministry for State Security.

370
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:06,517
-East German secret police, huh?
-Yes.

371
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,519
Proudly.

372
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,280
Excuse me.

373
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,992
I cannot drink any longer,
but I like to forget that.

374
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,412
We Germans are experts at forgetting.
We forgot we were Nazis.

375
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:30,917
Now we have forgotten 40 years
of Communism, all gone.

376
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:34,879
But it's not just history that's forgotten,
it's people too.

377
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:41,219
Please tell me more about
Nurse Gretchen Herfort.

378
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,767
Quite a story.

379
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:51,104
For a moment,
they had me convinced l was crazy.

380
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,940
But when they came to take me,
when they...

381
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,778
...killed your friend, l knew.

382
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,782
I'm not sure how l can be of service.

383
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:07,370
I need you to help me prove I'm me.

384
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,290
May I?

385
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,334
Please.

386
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,878
It's a gift from my father.

387
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,215
I always have it with me.

388
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,312
These mean anything to you?

389
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,898
No. It's my wife's writing.

390
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,900
So they mean something to her.

391
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:45,575
That's my schedule for this week.
I wrote it from memory.

392
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,494
Your wife's involvement in this.

393
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:53,166
There must have been something in
the past, a new friend, an acquaintance?

394
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,625
No, no, no.

395
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,335
Unexplained absence?

396
00:45:56,503 --> 00:46:00,131
No, no. There was nothing.
I would've known.

397
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,425
Men always like to think.

398
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,470
It's not Liz. l know her.

399
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,430
Yet she does not know you.

400
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,933
Look, whoever's been doing this,
they've been planning it for some time.

401
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:15,855
They have passports, credit cards,
family photos, for God's sakes.

402
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,399
I mean, this takes preparation,
doesn't it?

403
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:22,820
They have detailed knowledge of my
research, my relationship with Professor--

404
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:26,240
As well as the fact that you were going
to have a random accident...

405
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:30,703
...that would allow a stranger
to seamlessly take your place?

406
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,956
These people may be good,
but they are not God.

407
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,626
A little confirmation would be nice.

408
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,712
Somewhere there's proof.
They can't have thought of everything.

409
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,217
The question is,
why would they want to take your place?

410
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,761
What could they gain from being you?

411
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:50,556
What does your wife gain
by denying you exist?

412
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,852
Do you believe me?

413
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,647
In the Stasi, we had a basic principle:

414
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:01,901
Ask enough questions and a man who
is lying will eventually change his story...

415
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:05,446
...but a man who telIs the truth
cannot change his...

416
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,657
...however unlikely his story sounds.

417
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,660
-Do you believe me?
-l believe...

418
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,579
...you are telling the truth, Dr. Harris.

419
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,624
I'll start by calling your colleague
at Langemore.

420
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:20,169
As you say, it's Thanksgiving,
and there's the time difference...

421
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:23,422
...so it may take time to make contact.

422
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,300
Then there is the question of....

423
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,886
Oh, of money. Of course.

424
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:33,057
Unfortunately, yes. Money.

425
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:38,479
Of course. Here.
Here's everything l have.

426
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:42,191
I'll pay you in full as soon as l can.

427
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,531
-For expenses.
-Sure.

428
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,450
I'll need 24 hours.
Call me tomorrow afternoon.

429
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:55,746
And go find your taxi driver.
See if she'll talk to me.

430
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:59,584
She was there at the beginning of all this.
Perhaps she knows something.

431
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,377
I've already tried.

432
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,797
There may be detaiIs we've overlooked.

433
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:09,969
That's what l was really known for,
detaiIs.

434
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,351
Gina?

435
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,321
I know why you ran away
from the accident.

436
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,489
You're an illegal.

437
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,951
If the police had picked you up,
they would have deported you.

438
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:38,497
Look, l want you to have this.

439
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:42,293
-What if l don't want it?
-It's worth at least 5000 Euro.

440
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:44,837
Feel the weight of it.
Go on. It's the real thing.

441
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,718
"E.H. to M.H."?

442
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:56,182
Elizabeth Harris, my wife, to me, Martin.
Special gift.

443
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,896
Okay, Martin Harris.
What do you want?

444
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:04,023
There's someone
I need you to speak to.

445
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:07,443
-I'm not talking to the police.
-He's not the police. I promise you.

446
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,196
I just need you to tell him
what happened.

447
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,990
Anything,
everything you can remember.

448
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,869
And l need a place to crash tonight.

449
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,959
Please?

450
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:33,844
Sentiment,
it's always the first thing to go.

451
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,473
OFFICER :

452
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,231
Brandt.

453
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,485
Jörgen?

454
00:49:57,035 --> 00:50:00,413
I picked you up from the Adlon Hotel.
You wanted to go to the airport.

455
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,748
You were in a hurry.

456
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,500
That's it?

457
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:08,462
But l'd just arrived.
Doesn't make sense.

458
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:12,591
She didn't recognize you?
How long have you been married?

459
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,385
-Five years.
-Five years?

460
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,054
I know it sounds crazy, but it's true.

461
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,389
This is it.

462
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,099
Sorry, no elevator.

463
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,520
I know, not the Adlon Hotel.

464
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:41,704
The walIs are made of cardboard,
but it's home.

465
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:45,708
I have to work tonight.
You can sleep in there.

466
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,626
I have extra mattress.

467
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,087
It's quaint.

468
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,944
Would you mind if l took a shower?

469
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:58,155
You could try. I'm not sure you will fit.

470
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:04,370
The light is broken. You need to leave
the door open if you want to see anything.

471
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,638
-I'm sorry. I just-- I'm sorry.
-l give you a place to stay.

472
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,391
-That does not give you the right to--
-You're right.

473
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:28,394
They're good, the drawings.

474
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:43,742
You want to know?

475
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:50,374
This is me.

476
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:53,419
Two thousand
two hundred fifty-eight Euros...

477
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,588
...and counting.

478
00:52:56,298 --> 00:53:01,260
I get to 4000, l can buy papers
so l can get the hell out of here.

479
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:04,638
Sell the watch.
You'll get more than you need.

480
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,515
I plan to.

481
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:26,911
Ohh.

482
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:28,954
How do you sleep?

483
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,499
Eh. He never goes for very long.

484
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,753
This guy, Jörgen.

485
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:39,048
He's absolutely no danger to you.

486
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,510
Okay.

487
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,650
Hello.

488
00:53:58,818 --> 00:53:59,985
You got company.

489
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,320
Do you have the keys?

490
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,031
Bring it back to my place,
leave the keys on the TV...

491
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,492
...and don't forget to reset the meter.

492
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,203
-You're the best.
-l know. Come.

493
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,334
Yes, l sleep with every American
you send my way.

494
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,127
No need to explain.

495
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,524
Biko! You're going to be late.

496
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,565
Shh.

497
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,447
Jones?

498
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:01,166
Biko? Biko?

499
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,889
Who are you?

500
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,641
Who the hell are you?

501
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,025
Biko's keys.

502
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:11,236
Give them to me.
Come on, you can't stay here.

503
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,584
This one!

504
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,933
Are you all right?

505
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,604
That guy,
he killed a nurse in the hospital.

506
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,232
-What?
-He killed a nurse.

507
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:54,446
Shit!

508
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,062
-Left, go left!
-Hang on!

509
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,021
-Where is he?
-l can't see him.

510
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:23,243
-Where is--? Where's the wiper switch?
-It's on the left!

511
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,537
Shit!

512
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:44,222
Come on! Go!

513
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,681
-Get off the tracks!
-I'm trying to!

514
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:41,113
Jesus!

515
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:07,139
Come on, come on! Go!

516
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:13,937
- Come on!
- Run!

517
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:28,910
In here.

518
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,913
Out of the way. Out of the way.

519
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,585
-We are being followed.
-Vladimir.

520
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:15,499
How does it feel

521
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:19,211
To treat me like you do?

522
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:23,548
When you've laid youy hands upon me

523
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:26,927
And you've told me who you aye

524
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,597
I thought l was mistaken

525
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,979
How do l feel?

526
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,900
Tell me now how do I feel?

527
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,447
Gina.

528
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:52,702
You have to know l have never laid eyes
on those men.

529
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,373
Why the hell did you
have to get into my taxi?

530
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,500
I wish I hadn't. Believe me.

531
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:06,299
And Biko. His family is in Africa.

532
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:09,928
The money will just stop coming.
They will never know why.

533
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:16,101
Men like that, back there.

534
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,270
I have seen those kind of men before.

535
01:04:19,438 --> 01:04:21,731
They killed my family in Bosnia.

536
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:25,026
My mother, my father, my brothers,
slaughtered!

537
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:26,862
We have to disappear.

538
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:31,867
-Gina, they're after me, not you.
-Don't be stupid. They're after both of us!

539
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,870
If they killed Biko,
they'll kill me just as easily.

540
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,358
Are you ready?

541
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,028
Don't ask.

542
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,413
Thank you.

543
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:06,795
I'm sorry I brought more trouble
into your life.

544
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:11,341
I will try and make up for it. I promise.

545
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:17,722
I know.

546
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:21,643
I've figured something out.

547
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,566
It's a simple code.

548
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:31,152
The first number refers to a page
in the book...

549
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:35,156
...the second to a line on that page,
the third to words on that line.

550
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:36,533
What are the words?

551
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,535
The Latin names of two plant species:

552
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:41,997
Calochortus albus
and Umbellularia Californica.

553
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:46,376
Fairy Lantern and California Bay,
both common, flowering plants.

554
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:48,461
What does it mean?

555
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,505
That I don't know.

556
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:53,717
Not part of your work,
or Professor Bressler's?

557
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:55,010
No.

558
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:58,430
Tell me, Martin, how close
are Professor Bressler and Prince Shada?

559
01:06:58,597 --> 01:07:02,100
Very close. The prince is sponsoring
the summit. They're both progressives.

560
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:04,602
Bressler wants to end world hunger.

561
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:07,439
He's researching new forms
of crop cuItivation...

562
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:10,025
...offering open access to his data.

563
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:11,860
The prince funds his work.

564
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:15,572
He knows the world will need food
long after his oil resources are depleted.

565
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:18,116
Those agricuItural patents
will be worth a fortune.

566
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,577
But the prince's progressiveness
has cost him.

567
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:23,621
Extremists in his own country
hate him...

568
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:29,127
...and yet he perseveres his course,
despite muItiple attempts on his life.

569
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:32,756
There's a cocktail party before Bressler's
speech tonight, is that correct?

570
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:34,340
Yes.

571
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,428
For some, that might be a very good
reason to want to be you.

572
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:41,306
Martin Harris with just a few guests...

573
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:44,976
...in a confined space
with Prince Shada.

574
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:56,780
Jörgen may be right,
but he might not be able to prove it.

575
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:58,364
I need to find Liz.

576
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:00,575
Oh, Martin, that is not a good idea.

577
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:03,536
The people who have her
have been sticking to my schedule.

578
01:08:03,704 --> 01:08:05,371
I know where she'll be today.

579
01:08:05,539 --> 01:08:09,375
Someone will be watching her.
What if he's there?

580
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:14,380
He won't be. He's me, remember?
He'll be meeting with Bressler.

581
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:00,218
-Yeah?
-They just sat down.

582
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:02,971
Let me know when they leave. Thanks.

583
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,555
Okay.

584
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:57,108
Please leave a message after the tone.

585
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:44,632
Liz.

586
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:47,385
What are you doing here?

587
01:11:47,928 --> 01:11:48,970
Liz. What's happening?

588
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,347
Are you crazy?
You have to leave me alone.

589
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:54,225
Why? You have to tell me why.
Are they making you do this?

590
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:57,812
-Are they threatening you?
-How did you find me? Did you follow me?

591
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,480
When we arrived, you saw the ad.

592
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:02,734
You mentioned when we first saw
her show, in Chicago, together.

593
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:04,736
Don't you remember?

594
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:24,714
-l can't get out.
-Come with me right now.

595
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:27,050
No. They'll kill us both.

596
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:30,928
I never should have left you.
I never should have gotten into that taxi.

597
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:32,889
You don't understand, do you?

598
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:37,435
Your briefcase.
It got left behind at the airport.

599
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,062
That's why you were going back.

600
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:41,356
You need to find it.

601
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:42,899
Wait for me there.

602
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:44,108
Liz, Liz, wait.

603
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:00,958
I love you.

604
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,597
-What did she say?
-Not here.

605
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:17,475
Where have you been? Hm?

606
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:30,113
I have to go to the airport right away.

607
01:14:00,018 --> 01:14:01,018
Ja?

608
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:02,812
- Is this Ernst Jörgen?
- Yes, it is.

609
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:06,691
My name is Rodney Cole.
I received a phone message from you.

610
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:10,319
And l received two from Martin as well.
What's the problem?

611
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:16,033
Oh, dear. Oh, that's unbelievable.
The poor man.

612
01:14:16,201 --> 01:14:19,162
Well, listen, here's the good news.
I've just arrived in Berlin.

613
01:14:19,329 --> 01:14:23,708
Yes, I've been teaching in Leipzig,
at the Hochschule fÃ¼r Technik.

614
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:26,502
I'm sorry, please excuse my German.

615
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:29,422
Well, l came up for the last day
to hear Bressler's speech.

616
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:31,340
I could come right over.

617
01:14:31,508 --> 01:14:33,134
No, no, no, it's fine.

618
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:37,597
It's no problem at all. It's not far.
I know exactly where you aye.

619
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:40,975
I look forward to meeting you, Mr. Cole.

620
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:44,020
Well, then1 l'll see you soon. Bye.

621
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,403
Rodney Cole?

622
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:55,990
Leipzig?

623
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:23,643
Herr Jörgen?

624
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:25,228
Dr. Cole.

625
01:15:25,812 --> 01:15:27,522
How do you do?

626
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:29,899
Thank you.

627
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:39,242
Drink?

628
01:15:39,409 --> 01:15:42,954
I have a bottle labeled brandy,
which is more than likely hair lacquer...

629
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:47,166
...or some vodka my neighbor gave me
after it made her husband go blind.

630
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:48,876
No, thank you.

631
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:51,546
Maybe some coffee?
I'm making some for myself.

632
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:53,965
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

633
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,153
You were in the military.

634
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:20,700
In the Stasi in East Germany.

635
01:16:20,867 --> 01:16:23,661
Well, my grandson's gonna be
very excited to hear that.

636
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:26,163
He loves all this Cold War stuff.

637
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:28,332
Oh, look at that.

638
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,251
What kind of car is that?

639
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:33,129
That's a Volga GAZ-24.

640
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:36,841
Suspension of a donkey cart
and smelled like a tannery.

641
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:40,928
Vanished as quickly as the Wall.

642
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:56,277
Oh. This business with Martin
is a hell of a thing. How did he find you?

643
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,654
Quite by chance, as it happens.

644
01:16:58,822 --> 01:17:02,950
I would say he was damn lucky.
How can l help?

645
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:07,121
Come with us to the authorities.
Help them confirm his identity.

646
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:11,042
The authorities?
Oh, Jesus. Is it that bad?

647
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:16,255
I mean, a man comes to you with a story.
Why did you take his case?

648
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:19,342
Eh. Curiosity.

649
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:22,553
Is that all?

650
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:28,559
There's not much in this world left
to interest an old spy like me.

651
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:31,228
A few questions l still think over.

652
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:34,982
One in particular
from when I worked for the AufklÃ¤rung...

653
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:38,235
...our Foreign Intelligence wing.

654
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:44,116
They used to talk about
a European-based assassination unit...

655
01:17:44,284 --> 01:17:47,328
...called Section 15.

656
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:49,705
Freelance, deniable.

657
01:17:49,873 --> 01:17:52,083
They'd work for whoever would pay.

658
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,877
Public sector, private sector.

659
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:57,755
Second-to-none
in their planning and efficiency.

660
01:17:58,215 --> 01:18:01,092
What's more, they never failed.

661
01:18:01,259 --> 01:18:03,636
And l am told
they are still in existence...

662
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:07,640
...but that's only rumor, of course.

663
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:12,728
You had time after l called you.

664
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:14,689
Why didn't you run?

665
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:18,734
Where should l run from Section 15,
Mr. Cole?

666
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:20,611
I can hardly walk.

667
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:27,618
Before we could get Chesterfields,
I smoked 60 machorkas a day.

668
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:32,957
FiIthy Soviet things.
Killed more Russians than Stalin.

669
01:18:34,167 --> 01:18:38,212
My doctors assure me
I'll soon be joining their list of casuaIties.

670
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:39,964
I want to know how he found you.

671
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:43,968
I want every name,
every source you contacted on his behaIf.

672
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:47,054
And then what?

673
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:50,474
We shake hands and you go away?

674
01:19:22,966 --> 01:19:24,842
Cyanide.

675
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:30,556
You never think you'll have the courage
to use it.

676
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:33,225
But you do.

677
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:35,853
The best of us do.

678
01:19:45,655 --> 01:19:49,825
What if he remembers everything?

679
01:19:49,993 --> 01:19:52,203
What then?

680
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:17,353
Wait, wait. Please.

681
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:26,487
The combination for the lock is....

682
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:34,411
Two eight zero...

683
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,750
Two eight zero six three five.

684
01:21:33,471 --> 01:21:35,472
Who am l?

685
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,266
May I?

686
01:21:55,827 --> 01:21:59,288
You shouldn't stay here.
It's not safe for you.

687
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:00,748
Liz told me to wait here.

688
01:22:04,836 --> 01:22:06,003
Where are you going?

689
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:12,134
You've got your life back.
I'm happy for you.

690
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:13,928
Now I need to get on with mine.

691
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:15,804
Gina.

692
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,197
Thank you.

693
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:35,115
It's more than l need.

694
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:38,994
It's less than you deserve.
For everything you've been through.

695
01:22:39,162 --> 01:22:40,454
Go on, take it.

696
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:47,628
What if she told them
where you were going?

697
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,088
Liz? She wouldn't.

698
01:22:49,255 --> 01:22:50,297
How do you know?

699
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:53,884
Gina, she's my wife.

700
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:58,389
Yes, she is.

701
01:23:02,185 --> 01:23:03,560
It's too heavy for me.

702
01:23:40,765 --> 01:23:44,101
Martin.

703
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:46,562
Oh, my God, look at you.
How are you doing?

704
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:48,188
Rodney? What are you doing here?

705
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:51,025
Well, you called me.
Don't you remember?

706
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:54,486
You left a message on my machine.
I got on the first plane l could.

707
01:23:54,654 --> 01:23:58,282
-What have you gotten yourself into?
-I'm sorry to drag you into this, but--

708
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:01,618
Don't be. We've been friends
for 15 years.

709
01:24:01,786 --> 01:24:04,371
I know you'd do the same for me.

710
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:23,307
Let me take that for you, huh?

711
01:25:57,569 --> 01:25:59,319
I've never had this happen before.

712
01:25:59,487 --> 01:26:02,322
You really think you are Martin Harris,
don't you?

713
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:05,826
What the hell, Rod?

714
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:08,745
You're my oldest friend.

715
01:26:08,913 --> 01:26:13,333
You know who l am. It's me.
It's not this other guy. He's not--

716
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:16,253
Martin Harris? No, course he's not.

717
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:17,754
But, then, neither are you.

718
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:22,634
-What?
-There is no Martin Harris.

719
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,013
He doesn't exist.

720
01:26:26,514 --> 01:26:27,723
You invented him.

721
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:29,892
He's your legend.

722
01:26:30,059 --> 01:26:34,062
You just made him up as a cover
to get into the conference.

723
01:26:36,065 --> 01:26:40,277
-You're not making sense. Liz--
-Liz.

724
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:43,739
Liz is not your wife.

725
01:26:47,118 --> 01:26:48,785
You were a professional team.

726
01:26:48,953 --> 01:26:51,538
No. No, no. This is insane. She--

727
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:54,875
Your memories are not real.

728
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:58,086
Martin Harris is a fabrication.

729
01:26:58,254 --> 01:27:02,758
You just invented a life,
and then you filled in the gaps.

730
01:27:08,806 --> 01:27:10,891
She's right. You're really gone on this.

731
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:14,394
She had to go in with a backup.
How do you think she feels?

732
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:19,942
They're gonna write
a textbook on you someday.

733
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:22,903
And thank you for retrieving the briefcase
from the airport.

734
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:26,907
Leaving it there was untidy.

735
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:30,869
It was a loose end
that didn't fit in with our plans...

736
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:33,747
...and Jörgen figured us out.

737
01:27:35,833 --> 01:27:38,335
By the way, he's dead.

738
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:42,005
And he died very well.

739
01:27:42,882 --> 01:27:46,969
And I'm afraid that isn't something
I'm gonna be able to say about you.

740
01:27:47,845 --> 01:27:49,680
I'm sorry.

741
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:54,601
I'm really, really sorry.

742
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:01,525
Rodney!

743
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:05,028
Why are you doing this?

744
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:21,128
One year of preparation.

745
01:28:21,754 --> 01:28:24,256
We did everything we could
to make you come back.

746
01:28:24,424 --> 01:28:27,968
Do you know how much time
you've wasted? It's Thanksgiving.

747
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:30,679
I could've been home with my family,
having dinner...

748
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:33,890
...instead of cleaning up your mess
because you bumped your head...

749
01:28:34,058 --> 01:28:36,059
...and started to believe your cover.

750
01:28:36,227 --> 01:28:37,728
Tell me...

751
01:28:38,896 --> 01:28:40,314
...who am I?

752
01:28:43,192 --> 01:28:47,529
You were a trained assassin,
and you were my best boy.

753
01:28:48,906 --> 01:28:54,411
And now you're just gonna be
another nameless dead junkie.

754
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:48,632
Gina, stay down!

755
01:30:18,162 --> 01:30:20,580
Gina. Gina.

756
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:58,618
No. No.

757
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:31,568
"Martin Harris...

758
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:37,115
...married to Elizabeth Terman,
July 1 8, 2006, Martha's Vineyard.

759
01:31:38,284 --> 01:31:41,745
Father died, September 9, 1 987,
of a heart attack."

760
01:31:41,913 --> 01:31:46,082
I made it up. I made it up
to kill a man I've never met.

761
01:31:56,093 --> 01:31:59,095
Look, August 27th, the entry stamp.

762
01:31:59,263 --> 01:32:01,765
You were in Berlin three months ago.

763
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:09,314
- Are you ready?
- Almost.

764
01:32:22,453 --> 01:32:23,870
Ready.

765
01:32:26,874 --> 01:32:30,293
Who are these people?
They can become anyone.

766
01:32:30,461 --> 01:32:31,628
They....

767
01:32:33,005 --> 01:32:34,756
We are killers.

768
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:38,927
Prince Shada
is gonna be assassinated tonight.

769
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:41,763
There's a bomb in his suite.
I put it there.

770
01:32:43,307 --> 01:32:45,475
You should've let me drown.

771
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:52,649
What matters is what you do now,
Martin.

772
01:33:08,207 --> 01:33:11,543
Prince Shada,
are you going to stay in Berlin?

773
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,963
Will you be funding
research at the university?

774
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:18,758
Are you interested
in GM crops, Prince Shada?

775
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:21,803
How long have you been
working with Professor Bressler?

776
01:33:46,037 --> 01:33:48,663
GUARD:

777
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:03,970
We're so honored you could attend.

778
01:34:04,138 --> 01:34:06,056
The honor is all mine.

779
01:34:12,688 --> 01:34:14,564
Would you like a drink?
In some circles...

780
01:34:14,732 --> 01:34:18,652
...my husband is more well-known
for his martinis than his research.

781
01:34:27,244 --> 01:34:30,580
- Do you have an invitation, sir?
- l don't know if I'm supposed to have...

782
01:34:30,748 --> 01:34:32,999
-...an invitation.
-Leo, please, come in.

783
01:34:33,167 --> 01:34:35,710
I don't think you need
an invitation to your reception.

784
01:34:35,878 --> 01:34:37,420
Good to see you.

785
01:34:37,588 --> 01:34:40,507
So good to see you.
Have you met our host?

786
01:34:40,716 --> 01:34:42,926
-Not yet.
-Hello.

787
01:34:43,094 --> 01:34:45,261
Now I can see why
somebody would pretend to be him.

788
01:34:47,973 --> 01:34:49,432
This way.

789
01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:01,027
Oh, let me take that.

790
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:05,281
-l'd rather hold on to this, if you don't mind.
-Oh, you can trust me, Professor.

791
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:07,784
Separation anxiety.

792
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:11,996
-Just leave it there, if you could.
-Of course.

793
01:35:12,164 --> 01:35:13,206
Thank you.

794
01:35:16,293 --> 01:35:17,419
Danke.

795
01:35:25,136 --> 01:35:27,095
Come, say hello to my friends.

796
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:29,347
Danke schön.

797
01:35:32,518 --> 01:35:34,769
Oh, excuse me.

798
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:20,398
It's you.

799
01:36:22,943 --> 01:36:24,694
I am not so sure about that.

800
01:36:25,529 --> 01:36:27,697
Many of my relatives would not agree.

801
01:36:29,241 --> 01:36:30,909
This way.

802
01:36:36,123 --> 01:36:37,207
Get your hands off her!

803
01:36:40,294 --> 01:36:41,586
Okay, I'm coming.

804
01:37:18,415 --> 01:37:22,085
There's a bomb in the Eisenhower suite.
I put it there three months ago!

805
01:37:22,253 --> 01:37:24,420
Now you are saying you are
Dr. Martin Harris?

806
01:37:24,588 --> 01:37:25,713
You're not listening!

807
01:37:25,881 --> 01:37:28,591
Take me to the room.
I'll show you exactly where it is.

808
01:37:28,759 --> 01:37:31,594
Up to the room, in the middle of a party
with Prince Shada...

809
01:37:31,762 --> 01:37:35,890
...and the world's leading scientific minds?
Of course, why didn't you say so before?

810
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:50,280
I'm not lying! Pull up the reception
recordings from August 27th of this year.

811
01:37:50,447 --> 01:37:52,365
Do it now, or many people will die!

812
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:06,129
-Excuse me, I'm going to grab my bag.
-Sure.

813
01:38:13,345 --> 01:38:18,057
Here. Why don't you just wear it?
Like some nerdy accessory?

814
01:38:18,225 --> 01:38:19,684
Oh.

815
01:38:21,145 --> 01:38:22,729
Thank you.

816
01:38:32,114 --> 01:38:35,408
- That's got all your secrets in it, right?
- If you'd like to say so....

817
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:38,244
Would you excuse me?
I have to go check on something.

818
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:44,667
Stop. Stop. That's it.

819
01:38:45,002 --> 01:38:48,004
Do you see? Look! Do you see?

820
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:06,022
Attention1 attention...

821
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:09,692
...could all guests leave the hotel
by the front entrance?

822
01:39:14,615 --> 01:39:17,450
- Shit.
- Attention, attention...

823
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:21,371
...could all guests leave the hotel
by the front entrance?

824
01:39:21,538 --> 01:39:22,872
Find the target. Finish it.

825
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,875
We got what we came for.
I'm going to take care of the bomb.

826
01:39:26,627 --> 01:39:28,836
-Forget about it.
-They have my image on file...

827
01:39:29,004 --> 01:39:30,630
-...from when we planted it.
-So?

828
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:34,092
I don't want my face connected
to an explosion we no longer need.

829
01:39:34,259 --> 01:39:35,510
Go!

830
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:47,021
Lily, Laurel.

831
01:39:47,648 --> 01:39:51,985
Bressler's girls. Lily, Laurel.
Flowering plants.

832
01:39:52,152 --> 01:39:55,071
Calochortus albus
and Umbellularia Californica.

833
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:56,864
The code, from the book.

834
01:39:57,032 --> 01:39:58,074
They're his passwords.

835
01:40:02,287 --> 01:40:04,956
Bressler's supposedly working
on a new strain of corn.

836
01:40:05,124 --> 01:40:08,084
One that can grow in any climate.
It's revolutionary.

837
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:10,420
If they access his research
and kill him...

838
01:40:10,587 --> 01:40:12,964
...it could be worth billions
in the wrong hands.

839
01:40:16,176 --> 01:40:17,885
Laurel! Laurel!

840
01:40:19,054 --> 01:40:21,723
-Papa!
-Laurel!

841
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:24,767
That bomb goes off, it'll look as if
Shada was killed by extremists.

842
01:40:24,935 --> 01:40:27,437
The prince was never the target.
It's Bressler.

843
01:40:28,272 --> 01:40:32,108
Listen, listen! You have to tell Strauss,
they're after Bressler!

844
01:40:32,276 --> 01:40:33,776
Do you understand?

845
01:40:37,573 --> 01:40:38,614
Go! Go!

846
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:43,077
Out of the way! Move! Move!

847
01:40:46,123 --> 01:40:48,041
- Laurel! Laurel!
- Papa!

848
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:52,045
Laurel! Laurel!

849
01:41:08,145 --> 01:41:09,812
Oh, Laurel.

850
01:41:11,148 --> 01:41:13,024
Papa!

851
01:41:14,985 --> 01:41:16,986
She was wandering around,
looking for you.

852
01:41:17,154 --> 01:41:18,446
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

853
01:41:18,614 --> 01:41:20,656
-We have to leave.
-Yes, yes.

854
01:42:06,203 --> 01:42:08,788
Christ, you really don't
remember anything, do you?

855
01:42:50,706 --> 01:42:52,039
This'll be at the party...

856
01:42:52,207 --> 01:42:54,584
...where we'll access Bressler's computer
and steal his files.

857
01:42:54,751 --> 01:42:56,752
The client wants this clean.

858
01:42:56,920 --> 01:43:00,047
He wants the material from Bressler's
computer and Bressler dead.

859
01:43:00,215 --> 01:43:01,841
No one can ever know what happened.

860
01:43:02,009 --> 01:43:05,094
When the bomb goes off,
it'll appear that Shada was the target...

861
01:43:05,262 --> 01:43:07,430
...and that Bressler
