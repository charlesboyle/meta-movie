1
00:00:23,502 --> 00:00:26,385
<i>In the year 1855,</i>

2
00:00:26,386 --> 00:00:30,467
<i>England and France were at
war with Russia in the Crimea.</i>

3
00:00:30,468 --> 00:00:33,721
<i>The English troops
were paid in gold.</i>

4
00:00:34,305 --> 00:00:39,935
<i>Once a month £25,000 in gold
was loaded into strongboxes...</i>

5
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:43,730
<i>inside the London bank of
Huddleston and Bradford...</i>

6
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:48,110
<i>and taken by trusted armed
guards to the railway station.</i>

7
00:00:48,402 --> 00:00:52,532
<i>The convoy followed no
fixed route or timetable.</i>

8
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:58,412
<i>At the station the gold was loaded into
the luggage van of the Folkestone train...</i>

9
00:00:58,413 --> 00:01:02,375
<i>for shipment to the coast
and from there to the Crimea.</i>

10
00:01:02,376 --> 00:01:06,796
<i>The strongboxes were placed in
two specially built Chubb safes...</i>

11
00:01:06,797 --> 00:01:10,759
<i>constructed of three-quarter-
inch tempered steel.</i>

12
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,555
<i>Each safe weighed 550 pounds.</i>

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,351
<i>Each safe was fitted with two
locks requiring two keys,...</i>

14
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,563
<i>or four keys altogether.</i>

15
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,610
<i>For security, each key was
individually protected.</i>

16
00:01:28,611 --> 00:01:34,408
<i>Two keys were entrusted to the railway
dispatcher, who kept them in his office.</i>

17
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,037
<i>A third was in the custody
of Mr Edgar Trent,...</i>

18
00:01:38,038 --> 00:01:41,332
<i>president of the
Huddleston and Bradford.</i>

19
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:44,752
<i>And the fourth key was
given to Mr Henry Fowler,...</i>

20
00:01:44,753 --> 00:01:47,963
<i>manager of the Huddleston
and Bradford Bank.</i>

21
00:01:47,964 --> 00:01:51,259
<i>The presence of so much
gold in one place...</i>

22
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:55,263
<i>naturally aroused the interests of
the English criminal elements,...</i>

23
00:01:55,264 --> 00:02:02,479
<i>but in 1855 there had never been a
robbery from a moving railway train.</i>

24
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,426
Is he dead?

25
00:04:31,427 --> 00:04:34,012
Mm.

26
00:04:41,896 --> 00:04:46,524
Robbery? I'd hardly call it that...
one poor fellow working alone.

27
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:48,777
He had no chance of success.

28
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:51,947
Indeed, speaking on
behalf of the bank,...

29
00:04:51,948 --> 00:04:58,120
I must inform you the matter was trivial
and hardly worthy of our consideration.

30
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:01,040
I think I may say that without
fear of contradiction.

31
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,917
The villain expired?

32
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:06,462
Quite. The guard threw him
from the train at full speed.

33
00:05:06,463 --> 00:05:08,756
He died instantly. Poor devil.

34
00:05:08,757 --> 00:05:12,469
- He's not been identified?
- I shouldn't think so.

35
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:17,265
The manner of his passing was such
that his features were... disarrayed.

36
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:20,060
He was obviously after
the Crimean gold.

37
00:05:20,061 --> 00:05:23,146
- Apparently. Speaking...
- This damnable war...

38
00:05:23,147 --> 00:05:26,399
- will be the undoing of the nation.
- He's off again.

39
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,154
Unrest in the north, and now this
ill-considered war with the Tsar.

40
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:33,824
What do you expect when one
man in seven has the vote?

41
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:36,785
We have shopkeepers voting now!

42
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:40,289
And women next. If
they get their way.

43
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:43,667
Women voting! Really!

44
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:47,838
- This robbery had interesting...
- They haven't the capacity for logic.

45
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:52,594
- Too emotional. Quite absurd.
- It's not their logical capacity I enjoy!

46
00:05:52,595 --> 00:05:57,724
- Even a good woman's too much trouble.
- Come, Arthur, they do have their uses.

47
00:05:57,725 --> 00:06:01,186
Edward's got the proper
view by not marrying at all.

48
00:06:01,187 --> 00:06:02,812
Someone will catch him.

49
00:06:02,813 --> 00:06:06,483
- I know one or two with their eye on him.
- No one will catch Edward.

50
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:10,488
God knows what a man may catch
in London if he's not married!

51
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:14,992
This thief on the train, Henry. Was
there a risk of him stealing the gold?

52
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:19,371
- None. Quite impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

53
00:06:19,372 --> 00:06:26,378
Utterly impossible. Two Chubb safes,
four keys separately guarded. Impossible.

54
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:30,258
- Still, I suppose it could be done.
- I can't imagine how.

55
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:34,804
A thief would have to get all four keys.
Two are locked away in the station.

56
00:06:34,805 --> 00:06:39,976
One is in the hands of our president,
Mr Edgar Trent, who is utterly reliable.

57
00:06:39,977 --> 00:06:43,980
I don't know where Mr Trent keeps
his key but I know of the fourth,...

58
00:06:43,981 --> 00:06:48,193
for I am myself entrusted
with guarding it.

59
00:06:48,194 --> 00:06:52,489
Damn it, Henry, when are you going to
tell us where you've hidden your key?

60
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,619
I keep it about my neck.
I wear it at all times.

61
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,370
Even when bathing?

62
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:01,874
Even while bathing. It
never leaves my person.

63
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,460
- Clever.
- Most ingenious.

64
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:08,756
So you see, to get all four
keys... quite impossible.

65
00:07:08,757 --> 00:07:13,970
The Crimean gold and all the bank's
other transactions are entirely safe.

66
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:16,097
Thank God for that.

67
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:19,518
You may count on it,
Edward. Count on it.

68
00:07:20,436 --> 00:07:25,982
- Who do those men think you are?
- Edward Pierce. A sharp businessman.

69
00:07:25,983 --> 00:07:30,237
A sharp businessman?
That covers a multitude of sins.

70
00:07:30,238 --> 00:07:32,824
It does among that group.

71
00:07:33,742 --> 00:07:36,327
And what's your business?

72
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:42,041
It's not really clear. I've made a great
deal of money in coal, in the north.

73
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:46,086
- Have you?
- Oh, yes, I have. I'm quite well-off.

74
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:47,421
Are you?

75
00:07:47,422 --> 00:07:52,802
I think so. I've... made
something of myself.

76
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:55,389
Do they believe all that?

77
00:07:56,974 --> 00:08:02,020
Among sharp businessmen one
doesn't ask too many questions.

78
00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:05,982
Do they know of your
interest in the theatre?

79
00:08:05,983 --> 00:08:08,693
An unmarried gentleman
must amuse himself.

80
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:13,157
- Must he?
- Oh, yes, he must.

81
00:08:14,492 --> 00:08:17,078
Did they mention the train?

82
00:08:17,203 --> 00:08:19,621
Mm-hm.

83
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:22,583
What did they say?

84
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:26,003
They all agreed that
it was impossible.

85
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:29,047
Simply impossible.

86
00:08:29,048 --> 00:08:31,635
You like that?

87
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:48,902
- I can tell it excites you.
- Mm-hm.

88
00:10:23,376 --> 00:10:26,087
Oh! Are you all right?

89
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,565
Nice pull.

90
00:10:49,987 --> 00:10:52,990
Not bad, if I do say so
myself. You look well.

91
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:55,117
Yes. How was the touch?

92
00:10:55,118 --> 00:10:57,202
You saw it, didn't you?

93
00:10:57,203 --> 00:11:00,289
Or was I so fast you
couldn't see it?

94
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,084
I saw.

95
00:11:04,085 --> 00:11:07,296
- Did you wire her?
- No, just my hands.

96
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:10,049
Hummingbirds.

97
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:17,849
- Thinking of a job, then?
- I may have one or two little things.

98
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:25,231
Those one or two little things...
Could they be crib jobs?

99
00:11:25,232 --> 00:11:26,524
They could.

100
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:29,527
- Bit dicey, are they?
- Very dicey.

101
00:11:29,528 --> 00:11:32,240
- Is it dipping or keys?
- Keys.

102
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:35,701
- Wax or a straightaway haul?
- Wax.

103
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:39,246
You didn't do the Berkeley
Hills job, did you?

104
00:11:39,247 --> 00:11:41,874
Berkeley Hills? Shit job.

105
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:46,336
A shit job? Well, they're clean
with 2,000 guineas gone.

106
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:49,757
No. I was thinking
of something bigger.

107
00:11:52,386 --> 00:11:56,097
- This wax. On the fly?
- Mm-hm.

108
00:11:56,098 --> 00:11:57,640
Then I'm your man.

109
00:11:57,641 --> 00:12:01,352
- The fastest screwsman you'll ever see.
- So I heard.

110
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:05,690
- What's it to be, then?
- First we must case a square-rigged gent.

111
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:09,026
Good night.

112
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:11,280
Mr Edgar Trent,...

113
00:12:11,281 --> 00:12:14,950
president of the Huddleston
and Bradford Bank,...

114
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:17,619
follows an inflexible routine,...

115
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,500
departing the bank at the end
of each day promptly at 7 pm.

116
00:12:39,184 --> 00:12:43,604
Mr Trent resides at number
seven Belgrave Square.

117
00:12:43,605 --> 00:12:48,568
It's a mansion of 23 rooms,
not including servants' quarters.

118
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:52,739
His second wife, Emily,
is 30 years his junior...

119
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:59,830
and with her unmarried stepdaughter
she runs the household very strictly.

120
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:05,794
There are ten servants employed.

121
00:13:05,795 --> 00:13:11,342
Coachman, butler, gardener,
doorman, cook and two maids.

122
00:13:11,343 --> 00:13:14,846
All the servants are content
and can't be bribed.

123
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:19,684
- Dogs?
- Two. Terriers. Walks 'em twice a day.

124
00:13:19,685 --> 00:13:23,021
Seven in the morning
and 8.15 at night.

125
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:25,690
- Children?
- Five.

126
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:29,902
Three at home. The youngest
is a boy who sleepwalks.

127
00:13:29,903 --> 00:13:32,615
Which creates a commotion.

128
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:48,880
No point in cracking a 23-room house
until we find out where the key is.

129
00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:53,011
The person who knows where
that key is is Mr Trent.

130
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:56,890
Really?

131
00:13:59,226 --> 00:14:04,481
He must have a weakness.
Gambling, drink... Women?

132
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,525
Well, hello!

133
00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:16,035
No, no, no.

134
00:14:17,245 --> 00:14:19,538
No!

135
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:27,755
No respectable gentleman
is that respectable.

136
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:04,210
- He's a ratting gent.
- Indeed he is.

137
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:18,308
Thank you, gentlemen, please!
Mind your back there, sir!

138
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:20,560
Thank you! Excuse me, sir!

139
00:15:20,561 --> 00:15:24,022
Nothing but the finest, gentlemen.

140
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:29,527
Every one country-born and bred,
not a water ditch among 'em.

141
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:33,949
Who wants to try a rat? Come on,
gents. Who wants to try a rat?

142
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,077
15 of your best for my fancy.

143
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:42,500
Weigh the fancy of Mr T.
A very sporting gentleman.

144
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,504
Let Mr T's fancy dog
through. There you are.

145
00:15:48,172 --> 00:15:53,511
- 14 pounds.
- 14 pounds is Mr T's fancy dog.

146
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,806
And he's called for
a try at 15 rats.

147
00:15:57,266 --> 00:16:00,310
- Shall it be three minutes, Mr T?
- Yes.

148
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:05,482
Three minutes it is. You
may wager as you feel fit.

149
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:09,277
Get him his 15, Tom.

150
00:16:11,281 --> 00:16:14,784
You win some, you lose some.

151
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:32,165
- Are you ready?
- Ready!

152
00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:36,961
And... go!

153
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:22,321
Time, gentlemen. Three minutes!

154
00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:26,950
Get the dog out. Get the dog out.
Thank you, gentlemen.

155
00:17:26,951 --> 00:17:29,035
Pay your debts. Who's next?

156
00:17:29,036 --> 00:17:32,331
Come on! Any man fancy his fancy?

157
00:17:32,332 --> 00:17:36,252
A sporting chap. You win one
or two, you lose one or two.

158
00:17:36,503 --> 00:17:42,842
Who's going to be next to try the finest
country-bred rats that money can buy?

159
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,477
May I join you?

160
00:17:51,644 --> 00:17:54,354
If you like.

161
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:10,538
Lover wasn't at his best. He lacked
bustle. But he came up well enough.

162
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:13,958
- My Lover will fight again.
- Indeed.

163
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:17,086
And I shall wager upon
him again when he does.

164
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:20,798
- Did you lose much?
- Ten guineas. A trifle.

165
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:23,676
Ten guineas!

166
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:27,597
Well, I'm pleased you
take it so lightly.

167
00:18:28,014 --> 00:18:31,977
I admire a man who may
keep a fancy and sport him.

168
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:36,690
I should do so myself were I not
so often abroad on business.

169
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:41,028
Whenever I'm gone, my wife
looks after the animals.

170
00:18:41,404 --> 00:18:46,450
I fear I've been too devoted to
business these past few years.

171
00:18:47,284 --> 00:18:49,870
I've never married.

172
00:18:50,872 --> 00:18:54,834
- Of course, I should like to.
- Of course.

173
00:18:56,378 --> 00:19:00,381
It's so hard to
meet a suitable girl.

174
00:19:10,434 --> 00:19:16,356
- What are you constructing?
- A water wheel. Delightful.

175
00:19:16,357 --> 00:19:22,112
Especially with the rusted curve of the
water wheel itself. Don't you agree?

176
00:19:22,113 --> 00:19:26,199
We are building the rusted
wheel at considerable expense.

177
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,997
It is constructed of previously rusted
metal. The craftsmen are ingenious.

178
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:37,795
But we must wait for the weeds to grow
before it takes on the proper appearance.

179
00:19:37,796 --> 00:19:40,589
Oh, I'm sure it'll
be a handsome ruin.

180
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,591
Where is Elizabeth?

181
00:19:42,592 --> 00:19:45,553
I have passed many
pleasant hours here...

182
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:50,601
watching the workmen fit each
piece into its precise slot.

183
00:19:51,018 --> 00:19:53,604
Such skill.

184
00:19:54,063 --> 00:19:55,939
They screw it together?

185
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,735
No, bolt it, actually, with
long bolts. Fitted tightly.

186
00:20:00,736 --> 00:20:05,324
Yes. Long bolts, fitted tightly.

187
00:20:05,866 --> 00:20:11,872
I've just returned from America,
a country of many prominent erections.

188
00:20:11,873 --> 00:20:15,125
It is exciting to see
things come together.

189
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:18,546
So long as the quality
does not suffer.

190
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:22,216
Tight-fitting joints.
That's the secret.

191
00:20:22,884 --> 00:20:26,345
It is so rare these days.

192
00:20:27,514 --> 00:20:31,351
It depends on the skill of
the workman, of course.

193
00:20:31,352 --> 00:20:34,479
And he must have the proper tools.

194
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,274
Ah, my darling daughter!

195
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:42,737
Now may I present Mr Edward
Pierce? My daughter Elizabeth.

196
00:20:42,738 --> 00:20:46,866
Miss Trent, you've taken
me completely by surprise.

197
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:49,536
I cannot tell if that's
to my advantage.

198
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:52,164
I can assure you it is, wholly.

199
00:20:52,165 --> 00:20:56,836
- Would you try one of these, Mr Pierce?
- With gratitude.

200
00:20:57,337 --> 00:20:58,379
Er...

201
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,715
We are just discussing
the ruins, Elizabeth.

202
00:21:01,716 --> 00:21:06,679
- It's coming along so nicely.
- That dreadful ruin. I can't bear it.

203
00:21:07,514 --> 00:21:10,015
They've taken away so many flowers.

204
00:21:10,016 --> 00:21:11,601
You're fond of flowers?

205
00:21:11,602 --> 00:21:13,603
- More tea, Mr Pierce?
- Ah, yes.

206
00:21:13,604 --> 00:21:17,941
Yes, I supervise the planting of
all the flowers in the garden.

207
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:19,859
What there is left of it.

208
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,695
I'm especially fond
of the primroses.

209
00:21:22,696 --> 00:21:24,114
Ah, yes!

210
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:26,908
Perhaps you'd like to see them?

211
00:21:27,034 --> 00:21:28,868
I'd be delighted!

212
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:31,456
Will you excuse us?

213
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:35,125
It's quite rare for a man to
take an interest in flowers.

214
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:38,880
The best of them are just
over here. Let me show you.

215
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,882
I don't know that he's
suitable for her.

216
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:45,761
- Oh, he seems nice enough.
- He has far too much to say.

217
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:50,015
We also have many daffodils.
They've just come up.

218
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:55,438
It gives me such pleasure to see beautiful
things spring forth. Don't you agree?

219
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,108
Yes, I do agree. But tell me...

220
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,577
He has his charm.

221
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,956
You don't care who
she marries, do you?

222
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:16,127
Is she really plain?

223
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,921
That she is.

224
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:23,468
- And you find her tedious?
- Unbearably tedious.

225
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:28,306
- How does she wear her hair?
- On her head.

226
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:31,518
Really, I never noticed.

227
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:35,522
You're in a hurry.

228
00:22:35,523 --> 00:22:37,774
I am a relentless suitor.

229
00:22:37,775 --> 00:22:41,737
Besides, she still hasn't
told me what I need to know.

230
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,323
Where did you learn to ride?

231
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:49,494
- A lady never asks such a question.
- I'm serious.

232
00:22:49,495 --> 00:22:51,497
France.

233
00:22:51,498 --> 00:22:53,791
On an estate in France.

234
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:56,210
Not in America?

235
00:22:56,211 --> 00:23:00,006
No, I've never been to America.

236
00:23:01,966 --> 00:23:04,552
When were you in France?

237
00:23:04,803 --> 00:23:07,597
It's been some time now.

238
00:23:09,057 --> 00:23:12,060
Do you ever tell anyone the truth?

239
00:23:12,061 --> 00:23:14,646
The truth?

240
00:23:15,022 --> 00:23:17,608
The truth?

241
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:20,944
No.

242
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:10,162
I worry about him so.

243
00:24:10,497 --> 00:24:14,500
- He was fearfully nervous this morning.
- Really?

244
00:24:14,501 --> 00:24:18,587
Father's always nervous when
he sends the gold to Crimea.

245
00:24:18,588 --> 00:24:20,964
He's a different man on those days.

246
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:23,759
He bears a heavy responsibility.

247
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,512
He acts so strangely!

248
00:24:28,264 --> 00:24:34,312
He's entirely opposed to the consumption
of any alcohol before nightfall.

249
00:24:34,313 --> 00:24:40,944
- Very sensible.
- I suspect he breaks his own regulation.

250
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:45,406
For each morning of the shipments
he goes alone to the wine cellars.

251
00:24:45,407 --> 00:24:50,704
With no servants to hold the
lanterns. He insists on going alone.

252
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:53,332
Perhaps he's just
checking the contents.

253
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:58,838
No, he relies upon my stepmother
to stock and care for the cellar.

254
00:24:58,963 --> 00:25:03,801
- Every man has his eccentricities.
- I suppose.

255
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:07,262
What are your eccentricities,
dear Edward?

256
00:25:07,263 --> 00:25:09,849
Mine? I have none at all.

257
00:25:10,016 --> 00:25:12,602
Well, one.

258
00:25:12,937 --> 00:25:17,607
I am excessively preoccupied
with a certain lovely young lady.

259
00:25:17,608 --> 00:25:19,609
Sir!

260
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,779
You're a bold rogue
to be so forward.

261
00:25:23,864 --> 00:25:29,411
I might even begin to suspect you
of some motive in your advances.

262
00:25:29,787 --> 00:25:32,248
Never, my darling.

263
00:25:32,457 --> 00:25:34,666
Oh, dear Edward.

264
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:37,253
I'm so happy.

265
00:25:37,712 --> 00:25:40,298
And I am happy too.

266
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:45,344
He keeps the key in
the bloody wine cellar.

267
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:40,777
Good evening, madam.
May I be of service?

268
00:26:40,778 --> 00:26:45,782
- Is this the household of Mr Jeffers?
- No, madam. Mr Jeffers' house...

269
00:27:29,536 --> 00:27:32,123
Thank you, my good man.

270
00:28:29,015 --> 00:28:32,686
- Shh!
- It's only the wind.

271
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:56,377
Where do you think it could be?

272
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,508
Shut up!

273
00:29:03,343 --> 00:29:05,928
Sorry.

274
00:29:13,228 --> 00:29:15,647
Shh!

275
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:43,050
John, would you check
the cellar, please?

276
00:29:43,051 --> 00:29:45,636
Yes, madam.

277
00:29:59,276 --> 00:30:00,943
John?

278
00:30:00,944 --> 00:30:04,739
- John? Where's John?
- I'm down here, sir.

279
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,702
- What are you doing down there?
- Madam felt she heard a noise...

280
00:30:09,703 --> 00:30:12,581
Madam always feels
she's heard a noise.

281
00:30:12,582 --> 00:30:16,168
Come along now. I need
you to find my best pipe.

282
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:20,506
- It's misplaced again.
- Certainly, sir.

283
00:30:20,923 --> 00:30:23,675
That was a close one.

284
00:30:23,676 --> 00:30:26,928
Didn't do my heart any
good, I'll say that.

285
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:29,431
Mind the light!

286
00:30:29,432 --> 00:30:31,267
Here.

287
00:30:31,268 --> 00:30:36,606
That's not the bloody key. See the rust?
Nobody's touched that betty in years.

288
00:30:36,607 --> 00:30:40,860
It's odd, though. I've never seen the
likes of that before, small as it is.

289
00:30:40,861 --> 00:30:45,615
Very delicate. It could be a lady's
twirl for some feminine trifle.

290
00:30:45,616 --> 00:30:48,201
Watch the light!

291
00:30:48,952 --> 00:30:54,250
It's not my fault you're having
trouble. It's your bloody idea, isn't it?

292
00:30:55,084 --> 00:30:57,919
- Here.
- That's a key for a Chubb safe.

293
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,798
Let's see how fast you can wax.

294
00:31:01,215 --> 00:31:03,508
Mind the light.

295
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:06,095
Bastard.

296
00:31:18,901 --> 00:31:20,776
Beautiful, isn't it?

297
00:31:20,777 --> 00:31:23,363
Brilliant.

298
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,826
What does this clause mean?

299
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:11,788
Never mind that. What about
that one over there?

300
00:32:11,789 --> 00:32:13,498
In pink?

301
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:17,419
Wouldn't mind making a deposit
in that one, I dare say.

302
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:21,089
If she didn't provoke
a hasty withdrawal.

303
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,550
Not on my account, I fancy.

304
00:32:23,551 --> 00:32:29,681
Besides, she is Sir John Basington's
minx and accustomed to hasty withdrawals!

305
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:33,395
Quite without principle,
don't you think?

306
00:32:36,023 --> 00:32:38,608
But here now... I say!

307
00:32:43,155 --> 00:32:45,323
Monsieur, avez... Excuse-moi.

308
00:32:45,324 --> 00:32:47,658
Have you got my deposit account?

309
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:53,040
That's what I call a proper woman.
Which is to say, not proper at all!

310
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:56,543
She gives good value,
long term or short.

311
00:32:56,544 --> 00:32:57,878
Eh?

312
00:32:57,879 --> 00:32:59,713
- You know her?
- Mm.

313
00:32:59,714 --> 00:33:04,051
Where have you been keeping
her, Edward, you rogue?

314
00:33:04,552 --> 00:33:09,723
She's a vision. Not at all
bad for a foreign woman.

315
00:33:11,351 --> 00:33:13,769
I don't think she's your type.

316
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:17,106
She's precisely my type.
Will you make an introduction?

317
00:33:17,107 --> 00:33:19,692
- Fowler.
- Trent.

318
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,780
Will you make an introduction?

319
00:33:24,489 --> 00:33:28,034
Not here, of course.
What are you doing tonight?

320
00:33:28,035 --> 00:33:31,330
Well, I had arranged to
go to the theatre...

321
00:33:31,331 --> 00:33:35,292
Come, come, my dear fellow.
Are we not friends?

322
00:33:38,296 --> 00:33:40,839
More than that, Henry.

323
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,425
Much more.

324
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:58,942
- That's the plan, is it?
- Yes, that's the plan.

325
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:02,904
That's all you have to say?

326
00:34:03,071 --> 00:34:05,448
It's the job, innit?

327
00:34:05,449 --> 00:34:09,952
I suppose you expect me to dab
it up with that fat, repulsive...

328
00:34:09,953 --> 00:34:13,540
I suppose you expect me
to go through with it!

329
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:16,126
It's up to you, innit?

330
00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:19,004
Bloody hell!

331
00:34:46,533 --> 00:34:49,118
Shall we go, darling?

332
00:35:10,267 --> 00:35:12,018
Very nice.

333
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:15,271
- She's here, is she?
- Oh, yeah, she's here.

334
00:35:15,272 --> 00:35:17,106
Evening, gentlemen.

335
00:35:17,107 --> 00:35:20,943
How can I be of service to you?

336
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:25,031
My friend would like to
see Madame Lucienne.

337
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,951
Madame Lucienne?

338
00:35:28,952 --> 00:35:31,079
Madame Lucienne.

339
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,958
She holds a very rigid standard.

340
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:38,044
- Well, that's all right, isn't it?
- Yes.

341
00:35:38,045 --> 00:35:40,631
Come this way.

342
00:35:53,729 --> 00:35:59,650
You go up the stairs, sir... and
through the first door on your right.

343
00:35:59,651 --> 00:36:02,236
Madame Lucienne will
be with you presently.

344
00:36:02,237 --> 00:36:04,822
- Very gay here.
- Yes.

345
00:36:33,854 --> 00:36:37,064
- Monsieur...?
- Er... Jones.

346
00:36:37,065 --> 00:36:38,691
Jones.

347
00:36:38,692 --> 00:36:42,487
I am very pleased to
make your acquaintance.

348
00:36:43,029 --> 00:36:44,822
I as well.

349
00:36:44,823 --> 00:36:46,282
You are nervous?

350
00:36:46,283 --> 00:36:50,370
No, I just thought we might
become... better acquainted.

351
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:54,166
Oh, mon chéri, you are nervous.
There is no need to be.

352
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:59,338
I will take care of
every little thing.

353
00:36:59,922 --> 00:37:03,675
And every big thing.

354
00:37:09,056 --> 00:37:11,267
Oh...

355
00:37:11,268 --> 00:37:14,938
Such a strong man!

356
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:19,692
Well, yes, I did a bit of sport.
When I was younger, of course.

357
00:37:19,693 --> 00:37:22,320
Oh, but you are still young.

358
00:37:22,863 --> 00:37:24,989
And very strong.

359
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:28,742
- You want this off as well?
- It is best, no?

360
00:37:28,743 --> 00:37:32,790
The touch of flesh to flesh.

361
00:37:32,999 --> 00:37:35,584
The warmth of the body.

362
00:37:36,127 --> 00:37:39,671
- This is the French way, is it?
- Oui, mon cher.

363
00:37:40,256 --> 00:37:43,341
- What is this?
- A key. But I'm afraid...

364
00:37:43,342 --> 00:37:47,470
Oh, there must be nothing...
nothing between us.

365
00:37:47,471 --> 00:37:50,057
Oh, yes.

366
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,774
Now if you will sit on the lit.

367
00:37:58,775 --> 00:38:03,029
- The what?
- The lit... the bed, the bed, the bed.

368
00:38:06,908 --> 00:38:11,330
Oh, it is so exciting!

369
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,875
You... How do you say...

370
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,212
You inflame me.

371
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:23,217
But, madame, do you not
remove your own clothing?

372
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,928
Oh, my own... Why, yes, of course.

373
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,431
In just a moment.

374
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,937
- Just a moment.
- Do make haste, madam.

375
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:37,523
Yes, yes, I will.

376
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,706
Oh, my God, the police!

377
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:55,084
Quel mess!

378
00:39:09,682 --> 00:39:12,059
Come on, Henry, for God's sake!

379
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,646
I'm coming!

380
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:18,440
- Police, where are they?
- Downstairs.

381
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:20,693
- But I could be ruined!
- Quite!

382
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:23,279
I know the back way.

383
00:40:19,755 --> 00:40:22,882
You couldn't have picked
something more difficult.

384
00:40:22,883 --> 00:40:25,468
- You said you're the bloody best.
- And I am.

385
00:40:25,469 --> 00:40:30,934
But that's the devil's own crib. I've
watched it three days. Look there.

386
00:40:31,143 --> 00:40:35,563
You have to get past those crushers,
then up those stairs in plain sight.

387
00:40:35,564 --> 00:40:38,232
Then into that crib.
Anybody can see you.

388
00:40:38,233 --> 00:40:42,028
Bloody silly. Invitation
to prison, that place is.

389
00:40:42,404 --> 00:40:44,446
What's your pogue up there?

390
00:40:44,447 --> 00:40:47,784
Two Chubb keys in
that green cupboard.

391
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,790
What might they be, them keys?

392
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:57,920
Two keys that I happen to want.

393
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,383
We're partners, aren't we?

394
00:41:03,384 --> 00:41:07,387
If you're trying to say that you
don't trust me completely...

395
00:41:07,388 --> 00:41:09,973
I don't trust you at all.

396
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,476
Good.

397
00:41:12,477 --> 00:41:17,189
We've been gulling banksmen,
now we're in a railway station.

398
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:20,443
What's in a station?
Trains is in a...

399
00:41:21,069 --> 00:41:24,071
Mother of God! You're
after the Crimean g...

400
00:41:24,072 --> 00:41:27,449
Trying to rob a moving
train... it can't be done.

401
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:28,993
Why not?

402
00:41:28,994 --> 00:41:31,663
- It hasn't been done, has it?
- No.

403
00:41:31,664 --> 00:41:34,457
Crimean gold. Mother of God!

404
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:39,170
That's £25,000, isn't it? A big
shipment, isn't it? 25,000 quid.

405
00:41:39,171 --> 00:41:41,464
- Mother of God!
- Are you ready to go in?

406
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:43,341
Am I... Yes.

407
00:41:43,342 --> 00:41:45,760
Where's the chavy?

408
00:41:45,761 --> 00:41:48,347
There.

409
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:52,101
He's your son.

410
00:41:52,102 --> 00:41:54,144
I don't have no son.

411
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:56,105
Louisa says he's your son.

412
00:41:56,106 --> 00:41:58,107
Hmph! Louisa!

413
00:41:58,108 --> 00:42:00,484
She wouldn't know. Is that him?

414
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:04,697
He's not my son. He's
too ugly to be my son!

415
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:08,242
So what's the sweetener?

416
00:42:08,243 --> 00:42:10,829
A guinea.

417
00:42:10,955 --> 00:42:14,291
Well, if he is my son,
he'll be worth it.

418
00:42:21,632 --> 00:42:24,968
- Are we ready?
- Mm!

419
00:42:38,942 --> 00:42:43,779
- Oh, Geoffrey! I've been robbed!
- Stop thief! Stop that boy!

420
00:42:44,489 --> 00:42:47,074
Somebody stop him!

421
00:42:47,909 --> 00:42:50,494
Police! Stop that boy!

422
00:42:50,996 --> 00:42:53,582
Police! Stop that boy!

423
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:56,960
Stop thief! Stop that boy!

424
00:42:56,961 --> 00:42:59,546
I've got him!

425
00:43:09,223 --> 00:43:13,102
- Stop that boy. He's a thief.
- What's going on?

426
00:43:14,104 --> 00:43:16,689
Oh, I'm sorry.

427
00:43:17,816 --> 00:43:20,234
Take that!

428
00:43:26,908 --> 00:43:29,493
Are you all right?

429
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,835
Under! After him.

430
00:43:38,921 --> 00:43:40,922
Get off!

431
00:43:41,632 --> 00:43:45,302
Oh, my dear chap. Awfully
sorry. Are you all right?

432
00:43:51,685 --> 00:43:53,645
Gotcha!

433
00:44:03,655 --> 00:44:07,741
Well done. And thank
you, gentlemen.

434
00:44:07,742 --> 00:44:11,079
Damn thieves. They're everywhere.

435
00:44:19,547 --> 00:44:23,299
- Did you wax them?
- Not a prayer. Not a bloody prayer.

436
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,677
Never crack that crib.

437
00:44:25,678 --> 00:44:29,264
- Not in daylight.
- I said it was impossible.

438
00:44:29,265 --> 00:44:32,143
- What about night?
- Night!

439
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:37,106
I've marked this crib
for three nights.

440
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:41,527
There's a jack at the top
of the stairs all night long.

441
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:52,873
He talks to the constable making his
rounds... but he doesn't leave his post.

442
00:44:56,669 --> 00:45:00,797
Then at two o'clock he
takes his tightener.

443
00:45:23,113 --> 00:45:28,117
And right at 2.30 he goes off to
relieve himself from his bottle of beer.

444
00:45:28,118 --> 00:45:30,704
And that's when I time him.

445
00:45:32,706 --> 00:45:37,044
I time him from when he goes
off to when he comes back.

446
00:45:49,348 --> 00:45:54,520
And it's been the same... three nights
running. A very regular bloke, is this jack.

447
00:46:05,824 --> 00:46:08,409
75 seconds.

448
00:46:08,701 --> 00:46:10,745
It's a coopered ken.

449
00:46:10,746 --> 00:46:16,376
You say you're the fastest screwsman
in the country. Well, here's a challenge.

450
00:46:16,377 --> 00:46:22,174
Challenge? 75 seconds for two keys?
It's nigh impossible.

451
00:46:22,508 --> 00:46:26,302
What if a snakesman comes over the
roof and cracks it from the inside?

452
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:30,599
What snakesman's to break that drum?
Nobody good enough is out.

453
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,351
The best is Clean
Willy and he's in.

454
00:46:32,352 --> 00:46:34,728
- Where's he in?
- Newgate Prison.

455
00:46:34,729 --> 00:46:37,440
And there's no escaping that.

456
00:46:42,111 --> 00:46:44,905
Only Willy can climb that.

457
00:46:45,365 --> 00:46:47,742
Shame he's in Newgate.

458
00:47:39,004 --> 00:47:42,507
No, guv, don't cut me. I'm goin'.

459
00:47:54,062 --> 00:47:57,481
Hello, dearie. Comin'
in for a good time?

460
00:47:57,482 --> 00:48:00,067
You won't be sorry.

461
00:48:26,386 --> 00:48:28,972
What's it to be, guv?

462
00:48:29,264 --> 00:48:31,266
Bit of a tickle for you?

463
00:48:31,267 --> 00:48:34,394
You dab it up with Clean
Willy the snakesman, right?

464
00:48:34,395 --> 00:48:36,980
I did. He's in Newgate now.

465
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:38,607
You visit?

466
00:48:38,608 --> 00:48:40,609
I do now and again.

467
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:43,820
I visits as his sister, see?

468
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:47,407
There's another of those if
you can downy him a message.

469
00:48:47,408 --> 00:48:49,701
What's it to be?

470
00:48:49,702 --> 00:48:54,707
- Tell Willy to break at the next topping.
- There's no breaks from Newgate!

471
00:48:54,708 --> 00:48:58,461
Tell him he breaks at the next
topping or he's not Clean Willy.

472
00:48:58,462 --> 00:49:02,256
Tell him to go to the house
where he first met John Simms.

473
00:49:02,257 --> 00:49:04,634
John Simms.

474
00:49:07,971 --> 00:49:10,557
Are you John Simms?

475
00:49:35,918 --> 00:49:39,962
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

476
00:49:39,963 --> 00:49:44,175
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

477
00:49:44,218 --> 00:49:48,346
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

478
00:49:49,181 --> 00:49:51,767
Fine day for a hanging.

479
00:49:52,268 --> 00:49:55,646
Do you really think he'll make it?

480
00:49:56,147 --> 00:49:58,732
- Did you bring the trimmings?
- It's all here.

481
00:49:58,733 --> 00:50:00,817
- Medicine?
- Everything.

482
00:50:00,818 --> 00:50:03,153
- Do you want some cold chicken?
- No.

483
00:50:03,154 --> 00:50:07,366
Willy's the best snakesman there is...
but he can't get out of there.

484
00:50:07,575 --> 00:50:10,912
Dearly beloved, wonder
not if the world hate you.

485
00:50:10,913 --> 00:50:15,666
We know that we have passed from death
to life because we love the brethren.

486
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:18,544
He that loveth not
abideth in death.

487
00:50:18,545 --> 00:50:21,380
Whosoever hateth his
brother is a murderer.

488
00:50:21,381 --> 00:50:26,427
And you know that no murderer hath
eternal life abiding in himself.

489
00:50:26,428 --> 00:50:30,265
In this we have known
the charity of God.

490
00:51:06,595 --> 00:51:09,180
And in God's house...

491
00:51:14,854 --> 00:51:19,816
Goodness and mercy all my
life shall surely follow me...

492
00:51:19,817 --> 00:51:23,070
and in God's house forevermore...

493
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:27,908
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

494
00:51:32,164 --> 00:51:35,041
They say Willy can
climb a wall of glass.

495
00:51:35,042 --> 00:51:38,295
If anyone can do it,
Clean Willy can.

496
00:52:32,852 --> 00:52:37,356
Oh, my! I think I'm going to die.

497
00:52:45,364 --> 00:52:47,950
Where is he?

498
00:54:17,336 --> 00:54:20,588
Good heavens! He's
in a right bad state.

499
00:54:20,589 --> 00:54:22,632
Here, come over here.

500
00:54:22,633 --> 00:54:25,468
Sit down.

501
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:34,770
Cabinet open...

502
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,564
- Cabinet shut.
- Cabinet shut.

503
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:39,816
Door.

504
00:54:39,817 --> 00:54:42,403
Steps.

505
00:54:44,697 --> 00:54:46,364
Done!

506
00:54:46,365 --> 00:54:48,074
Time?

507
00:54:48,075 --> 00:54:50,076
81.

508
00:54:50,077 --> 00:54:53,164
Well... better than last time.

509
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:54,498
Two seconds better.

510
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:57,168
But you still haven't
broken the 75 seconds.

511
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:59,587
Well, it is better.

512
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:02,173
But not good enough.

513
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:05,676
We'll try again later.

514
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:08,263
Where are you going?

515
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,807
But you're so tired.

516
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:13,394
I'm not tired.

517
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:26,531
Go!

518
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:29,118
Steps.

519
00:55:30,203 --> 00:55:31,579
Door.

520
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:34,624
- Cabinet open.
- Fastest bloody screwsman!

521
00:55:34,625 --> 00:55:36,959
Shut up. Time?

522
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,793
31.

523
00:55:37,794 --> 00:55:40,046
Cabinet shut.

524
00:55:40,047 --> 00:55:42,048
Door.

525
00:55:42,049 --> 00:55:44,634
Steps.

526
00:55:45,594 --> 00:55:47,762
Time?

527
00:55:47,763 --> 00:55:50,348
74.

528
00:55:52,935 --> 00:55:54,895
74?

529
00:55:54,896 --> 00:55:57,147
74.

530
00:56:01,903 --> 00:56:04,488
I always knew I could do it.

531
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,329
Psst!

532
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:34,916
Psst!

533
00:59:44,092 --> 00:59:46,010
Shit!

534
00:59:55,938 --> 00:59:58,148
Jed? Jed?

535
00:59:58,149 --> 01:00:00,066
- Yes.
- All right?

536
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:02,110
Oh, I'm well enough.

537
01:00:02,111 --> 01:00:04,195
You been at the fight?

538
01:00:04,196 --> 01:00:09,534
Hmph! Fancy Dan and Stunning
Bill. Wasn't my fight, was it?

539
01:00:09,535 --> 01:00:12,121
Put a sovereign on Bill.

540
01:00:14,374 --> 01:00:18,127
Well, he won! I've a
quid to show for it.

541
01:00:29,889 --> 01:00:33,352
I'll take another walk round.
See you later.

542
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,305
75 seconds, remember?

543
01:01:20,359 --> 01:01:22,527
Now!

544
01:01:34,749 --> 01:01:36,375
13...

545
01:01:36,376 --> 01:01:38,586
14...

546
01:01:38,587 --> 01:01:40,588
15...

547
01:01:40,589 --> 01:01:42,756
16...

548
01:01:42,757 --> 01:01:44,842
17...

549
01:01:44,843 --> 01:01:46,719
18...

550
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,344
19...

551
01:01:47,345 --> 01:01:50,097
- Where are the bloody keys?
- 20.

552
01:01:50,098 --> 01:01:52,392
21...

553
01:01:52,393 --> 01:01:54,352
No Chubb keys.

554
01:01:54,353 --> 01:01:56,312
23...

555
01:01:56,313 --> 01:01:58,356
24...

556
01:01:58,357 --> 01:02:00,233
- 25...
- Damn it!

557
01:02:00,234 --> 01:02:02,277
26...

558
01:02:02,278 --> 01:02:03,987
27...

559
01:02:03,988 --> 01:02:05,613
28...

560
01:02:05,614 --> 01:02:07,574
29...

561
01:02:07,575 --> 01:02:09,033
30.

562
01:02:09,034 --> 01:02:11,120
31...

563
01:02:11,204 --> 01:02:13,289
32...

564
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:15,166
33...

565
01:02:15,375 --> 01:02:17,335
34...

566
01:02:17,586 --> 01:02:19,545
35...

567
01:02:19,713 --> 01:02:21,672
36...

568
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,841
37...

569
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:25,927
38...

570
01:02:26,094 --> 01:02:28,095
39...

571
01:02:28,596 --> 01:02:30,348
40.

572
01:02:30,349 --> 01:02:32,308
41...

573
01:02:32,309 --> 01:02:34,394
42...

574
01:02:34,729 --> 01:02:36,646
43...

575
01:02:36,647 --> 01:02:38,773
44...

576
01:02:38,774 --> 01:02:40,901
45...

577
01:02:41,068 --> 01:02:43,070
46...

578
01:02:43,237 --> 01:02:45,238
47...

579
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:47,198
48...

580
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:49,159
49...

581
01:02:49,326 --> 01:02:51,036
50.

582
01:02:51,037 --> 01:02:53,205
51...

583
01:02:53,206 --> 01:02:55,208
52...

584
01:02:55,375 --> 01:02:57,251
53...

585
01:02:57,252 --> 01:02:59,169
54...

586
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:01,255
55...

587
01:03:01,381 --> 01:03:03,340
56...

588
01:03:03,341 --> 01:03:05,051
57...

589
01:03:05,301 --> 01:03:07,220
58...

590
01:03:07,345 --> 01:03:09,180
59...

591
01:03:09,431 --> 01:03:11,391
60!

592
01:03:11,392 --> 01:03:13,393
61...

593
01:03:13,394 --> 01:03:15,437
62...

594
01:03:15,438 --> 01:03:17,272
63...

595
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,107
64...

596
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:21,026
65...

597
01:03:21,235 --> 01:03:23,194
66...

598
01:03:23,195 --> 01:03:25,154
67...

599
01:03:25,155 --> 01:03:27,031
68...

600
01:03:27,032 --> 01:03:29,033
69...

601
01:03:29,034 --> 01:03:30,494
70.

602
01:03:30,495 --> 01:03:32,079
71...

603
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,956
72...

604
01:03:33,957 --> 01:03:35,833
73...

605
01:03:35,834 --> 01:03:37,751
74...

606
01:03:37,752 --> 01:03:40,171
75!

607
01:03:53,853 --> 01:03:56,480
I remember when we first met.

608
01:03:56,856 --> 01:04:01,026
I gave the most awful performance
in Way of The World.

609
01:04:01,402 --> 01:04:06,739
I went to my dressing room and there were
the beautiful flowers you'd sent me.

610
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:09,326
And then you walked in.

611
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:10,953
- Flowers?
- Mm.

612
01:04:10,954 --> 01:04:13,956
Dozens of them.
They were wonderful.

613
01:04:13,957 --> 01:04:17,251
I didn't send any. Must
have been someone else.

614
01:04:17,252 --> 01:04:19,962
I walked in and you thanked me.

615
01:04:20,296 --> 01:04:22,506
You're teasing me.

616
01:04:22,507 --> 01:04:25,760
Bloody waste of good
money, flowers.

617
01:04:27,345 --> 01:04:29,931
- You didn't?
- No.

618
01:04:35,062 --> 01:04:37,647
Really?

619
01:04:41,402 --> 01:04:43,987
Really?

620
01:04:44,238 --> 01:04:47,866
I had them at a good price.
I robbed a grave.

621
01:04:51,663 --> 01:04:54,665
All you ever think about is money.

622
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:58,586
All anyone ever thinks
about is money.

623
01:05:22,611 --> 01:05:24,445
Don't turn.

624
01:05:24,446 --> 01:05:26,572
- Mr Simms, is it?
- That's right.

625
01:05:26,573 --> 01:05:29,909
- You came alone?
- Yes, as you instructed.

626
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:33,288
- Everything the same on the railway line?
- All the same.

627
01:05:33,289 --> 01:05:34,832
Then it'll be tomorrow.

628
01:05:34,833 --> 01:05:39,002
- What'll be tomorrow?
- Never you mind. Here's 100 quid for you.

629
01:05:39,003 --> 01:05:41,588
Look the other way
and shut your mouth.

630
01:05:41,589 --> 01:05:44,258
- Right?
- Right, sir.

631
01:05:44,259 --> 01:05:47,345
Now, off you go and
don't look back.

632
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:01,401
Get a bowl of water in there.

633
01:06:02,695 --> 01:06:04,988
Put it in the corner, over there.

634
01:06:04,989 --> 01:06:07,281
As far away from me as you can.

635
01:06:07,282 --> 01:06:11,037
- He's pretty heavy, ain't he?
- Pretty hungry too.

636
01:06:14,249 --> 01:06:17,084
Sorry, sir. No one's
allowed to ride in the van.

637
01:06:17,085 --> 01:06:21,005
I've got to accompany the
animal. It's very valuable.

638
01:06:24,467 --> 01:06:27,177
He gets upset if I'm not with him.

639
01:06:27,178 --> 01:06:29,764
Yeah, very well.

640
01:06:41,068 --> 01:06:43,653
Doesn't care for travel.

641
01:06:49,952 --> 01:06:53,080
- You mean it's to be you?
- Aye.

642
01:06:55,959 --> 01:07:00,337
Where'd you make them impressions?
They keep all them keys separate.

643
01:07:00,338 --> 01:07:02,923
- Do they?
- Aye, they do.

644
01:07:03,007 --> 01:07:05,593
How'd you pull 'em?

645
01:07:06,761 --> 01:07:09,346
With incredible skill.

646
01:07:34,666 --> 01:07:39,336
The next gold shipment is in
a week. This time we take it.

647
01:07:39,337 --> 01:07:43,048
Agar will replace the gold
with these lead bars...

648
01:07:43,049 --> 01:07:45,884
and throw the bags from
the train at Romney,...

649
01:07:45,885 --> 01:07:50,223
where Barlow will collect them
and then drive to Folkestone.

650
01:07:50,224 --> 01:07:51,766
Where will we be?

651
01:07:51,767 --> 01:07:56,187
In a first-class compartment
enjoying the journey.

652
01:07:56,188 --> 01:07:58,356
What happens afterward?

653
01:07:58,357 --> 01:08:00,858
We divide the gold as agreed.

654
01:08:00,859 --> 01:08:03,277
After that.

655
01:08:03,278 --> 01:08:07,157
- After that?
- Yes, after that!

656
01:08:12,247 --> 01:08:14,832
You and I will go to Paris.

657
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:29,638
You have it all worked out. We ride
on the train and they do the work.

658
01:08:29,639 --> 01:08:33,309
They have to earn their
share, don't they?

659
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:35,896
It's all very smooth.

660
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:39,691
Unless something goes wrong.

661
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:42,026
What could go wrong?

662
01:08:42,027 --> 01:08:44,404
My dear Mr Simms.

663
01:08:44,405 --> 01:08:47,032
As your humble servant,...

664
01:08:47,449 --> 01:08:51,329
I would be greatly
obliged and indebted...

665
01:08:51,955 --> 01:08:57,168
if you could contrive to meet with
me at the Palace, Sydenham...

666
01:08:57,460 --> 01:09:00,046
for the purpose...

667
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:03,716
For the purpose...

668
01:09:04,133 --> 01:09:07,928
For the purpose of discussing
some matters of...

669
01:09:07,929 --> 01:09:10,013
mutual interest.

670
01:09:10,014 --> 01:09:12,600
Most respectfully,...

671
01:09:12,601 --> 01:09:15,312
William Williams, Esquire.

672
01:09:16,021 --> 01:09:18,607
That should do it.

673
01:09:19,983 --> 01:09:22,569
Well now, Willy...

674
01:09:22,653 --> 01:09:25,113
What's this fellow Simms up to, eh?

675
01:09:25,114 --> 01:09:27,448
Please, sir, I can't tell you.

676
01:09:27,449 --> 01:09:31,662
Should have thought of that before
we caught you with this purse.

677
01:09:31,663 --> 01:09:34,248
I don't want to go
back to prison, sir.

678
01:09:34,249 --> 01:09:36,834
Well, then. Better tell us.

679
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:39,545
I don't know, sir. I told you.

680
01:09:39,796 --> 01:09:43,924
All's I know is that he's a cracksman
planning a flash pull, he is.

681
01:09:43,925 --> 01:09:46,510
The letter will put you on to him.

682
01:09:51,767 --> 01:09:53,935
We'll see.

683
01:09:53,936 --> 01:09:56,521
They'll kill me, they will.

684
01:09:56,980 --> 01:10:00,609
Then see you aren't
running off again, eh?

685
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:06,614
We'll have a look at this
mysterious Mr Simms.

686
01:10:49,368 --> 01:10:51,829
Don't turn round, Willy.

687
01:10:57,085 --> 01:11:01,088
- Now, what is it?
- I'm needing a bit, Mr Simms.

688
01:11:02,006 --> 01:11:06,218
- You've been paid.
- I'm needing more.

689
01:11:06,886 --> 01:11:10,973
- You been working, Willy?
- No!

690
01:11:10,974 --> 01:11:14,394
- Did the crushers pick you up?
- I swear it, no!

691
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:23,027
- Willy, if you've turned nose on me...
- I swear it's no flam.

692
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:27,657
A finny or two's what I need
and that'll be an end to it.

693
01:11:29,117 --> 01:11:31,912
There's a finny in your pocket.

694
01:11:32,956 --> 01:11:34,998
You're sweating.

695
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:38,835
If you've turned nose on
me, I'll see you in lavender.

696
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:41,255
Not me, sir. I swear!

697
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:49,638
Three crushers.

698
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:11,954
Edward! Edward Pierce!

699
01:12:12,664 --> 01:12:16,500
Edward, we were wondering
what had become of you.

700
01:12:16,501 --> 01:12:19,086
I got married.

701
01:12:19,295 --> 01:12:21,881
Must dash.

702
01:12:25,051 --> 01:12:29,721
- Do you think he's in trouble?
- Wouldn't surprise me.

703
01:12:29,722 --> 01:12:34,477
Very rough man. Not
a good sort at all.

704
01:16:03,487 --> 01:16:07,364
- So, the snakesman is dead.
- I'm afraid so, sir.

705
01:16:07,365 --> 01:16:11,620
- And this fellow Simms has vanished?
- Yes, sir.

706
01:16:11,621 --> 01:16:14,456
And we don't know who
he is or what he intends?

707
01:16:14,457 --> 01:16:17,709
- We are entirely without clues.
- No, not entirely.

708
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:23,548
We know Simms arranged for Clean Willy
to break from Newgate some months ago.

709
01:16:23,549 --> 01:16:27,218
- So it's a long-standing plan.
- A plan we don't know.

710
01:16:27,219 --> 01:16:31,223
Quite. But we do know Simms is a
safecracker. He must be after safes.

711
01:16:31,224 --> 01:16:36,228
And Willy broke into the dispatcher's
office of the South Eastern Railway Line.

712
01:16:36,229 --> 01:16:38,647
Hmm.

713
01:16:38,648 --> 01:16:43,903
And it occurred to me, could this Simms
be planning to steal the Crimean gold?

714
01:16:43,904 --> 01:16:46,698
Steal from a moving railway train?

715
01:16:47,282 --> 01:16:49,533
Who could imagine such a thing?

716
01:16:49,534 --> 01:16:51,912
The next gold shipment is tomorrow.

717
01:16:51,913 --> 01:16:55,832
I've alerted the railway line
to take extra precautions.

718
01:16:55,833 --> 01:16:59,169
- What's this?
- Precautions, sir.

719
01:16:59,170 --> 01:17:03,590
I will ride the train to Folkestone
tonight. I shall be there tomorrow...

720
01:17:03,591 --> 01:17:06,843
in case there's any tomfoolery
when the gold arrives.

721
01:17:06,844 --> 01:17:10,639
- Very enterprising of you.
- Thank you, sir.

722
01:17:10,641 --> 01:17:14,393
We've made new security
arrangements throughout.

723
01:17:14,394 --> 01:17:15,978
New lock.

724
01:17:15,979 --> 01:17:21,567
New guard, just in case they do have
the audacity to try for the Crimean gold.

725
01:17:21,568 --> 01:17:23,861
Excellent foresight, Mr Sharp.

726
01:17:23,862 --> 01:17:27,448
I must commend you on your
attention in this matter.

727
01:17:27,449 --> 01:17:31,328
We certainly wouldn't
want to lose that gold.

728
01:17:46,844 --> 01:17:51,307
It's all changed. Everything.
Everything's changed.

729
01:17:51,308 --> 01:17:55,686
No one's allowed to ride in the luggage
van save Burgess himself as guard.

730
01:17:55,687 --> 01:17:58,522
And they've got a new
jack on the platform...

731
01:17:58,523 --> 01:18:01,609
who opens all parcels large
enough for a man to hide in.

732
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:07,198
And if that ain't bad enough, they've gone
and fitted a lock on the luggage van door.

733
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:13,455
They're locking it at the station and not
opening it until it gets to Folkestone.

734
01:18:13,456 --> 01:18:17,584
A precautionary measure.
All on account of the gold.

735
01:18:18,044 --> 01:18:21,296
Bloody outside lock! It can't
be worked from within.

736
01:18:21,297 --> 01:18:24,549
Even if I was to be able
to get inside the van...

737
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:28,511
I'd be locked inside there
until it gets into Folkestone.

738
01:18:28,512 --> 01:18:34,143
And who do you think's behind all this?
Only the crushers theirselves, that's who.

739
01:18:34,227 --> 01:18:36,479
Two plainclothes
jacks were there...

740
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:40,983
saying as how a Mr Simms was
planning to rob the Crimean gold.

741
01:18:40,984 --> 01:18:45,654
They don't have a high opinion of your
intelligence. But they credit your nerve.

742
01:18:45,655 --> 01:18:50,911
And they've put crushers on every
station on the line and at Folkestone.

743
01:18:50,912 --> 01:18:53,664
So. Here we are.

744
01:18:55,875 --> 01:19:00,545
Burgess is no use. I can't get into the van
because of that jack opening everything.

745
01:19:00,546 --> 01:19:06,092
Even if I could, I couldn't get the gold
out as the door's locked from the outside.

746
01:19:06,093 --> 01:19:09,054
So what's it to have
four keys, I ask you?

747
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:13,225
Four keys or 40 keys... it don't
make no bloody difference!

748
01:19:13,226 --> 01:19:17,313
It's a waste, the whole thing!
And nothing to be done about it.

749
01:19:17,314 --> 01:19:21,275
All on account of they found you
out, Mr Edward bloody Simms Pierce!

750
01:19:21,276 --> 01:19:26,364
That was something you didn't think of.
What have you got to say about that?

751
01:19:31,579 --> 01:19:34,164
Find me a dead cat.

752
01:20:05,864 --> 01:20:08,240
Now then, missy, now then.

753
01:20:08,241 --> 01:20:11,119
Oh, please, sir, can you help me?

754
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:14,039
The man is a
heartless beast, he is.

755
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:17,292
- What man?
- That guard upon the line, sir.

756
01:20:17,293 --> 01:20:21,213
He will not let me set my
dear brother on the train.

757
01:20:22,006 --> 01:20:24,758
He says it must be...

758
01:20:24,759 --> 01:20:26,384
opened!

759
01:20:26,385 --> 01:20:29,637
Why... the cruel rogue.

760
01:20:29,638 --> 01:20:32,558
We'll have your
brother on the train.

761
01:20:34,936 --> 01:20:36,562
There's, um...

762
01:20:36,563 --> 01:20:39,148
no need to open it.

763
01:20:43,236 --> 01:20:47,031
I, um... I see you have
a Bateson's belfry here.

764
01:20:47,032 --> 01:20:49,199
Oh, yes, sir.

765
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:55,666
Me brother, he was terrible afraid of
being buried alive, so here's the safety.

766
01:20:56,667 --> 01:21:01,755
Very thoughtful, I'm sure. Just
you dry your eyes. All will be well.

767
01:21:02,506 --> 01:21:04,883
Thank you, sir.

768
01:21:04,884 --> 01:21:08,220
I'll just... get this
business finished.

769
01:21:12,642 --> 01:21:16,604
- How could you be so cruel?
- I only told her the new rules.

770
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:20,817
- All containers to be opened.
- Yes, I know.

771
01:21:21,067 --> 01:21:26,030
Do you smell it? I think in this
case we can make an exception.

772
01:21:26,031 --> 01:21:27,323
Whatever you say.

773
01:21:27,324 --> 01:21:29,199
- Nephew!
- Uncle.

774
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,785
Nephew,...

775
01:21:30,786 --> 01:21:35,665
mind your duties. Open every parcel
and make no exception. No exception.

776
01:21:35,666 --> 01:21:37,627
Yes, Uncle.

777
01:21:38,878 --> 01:21:42,714
- What's that ungodly stink?
- The, er...

778
01:21:45,801 --> 01:21:50,013
- Scheduled for the morning train?
- Yes, Uncle.

779
01:21:51,933 --> 01:21:55,478
- See that you open it.
- But, er... Uncle...

780
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:59,565
No stomach for it, eh?

781
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:02,777
Dear God, you're a delicate one.

782
01:22:03,194 --> 01:22:05,404
All right, I'll do it myself.

783
01:22:05,405 --> 01:22:07,990
For opened it must be.

784
01:22:10,453 --> 01:22:12,328
Oh! Oh!

785
01:22:12,329 --> 01:22:16,082
My dear brother! Oh,
Richard. Richard, he lives!

786
01:22:16,083 --> 01:22:18,460
He lives! Oh, he's alive!

787
01:22:18,461 --> 01:22:22,255
Oh, make haste. He's alive!
Oh, praise God, he's alive!

788
01:22:22,256 --> 01:22:23,965
Oh, he's alive!

789
01:22:23,966 --> 01:22:26,384
Hurry! Hurry! Lest we are too late.

790
01:22:26,385 --> 01:22:28,803
I knew it was not cholera!

791
01:22:28,804 --> 01:22:30,347
Cholera?

792
01:22:30,348 --> 01:22:33,893
He was a quack to say it.
I knew it! Hurry. Hurry.

793
01:22:33,894 --> 01:22:39,190
- Five days I've waited to hear that bell.
- You say cholera? Five days?

794
01:22:39,733 --> 01:22:42,318
Richard! Richard!

795
01:22:42,610 --> 01:22:45,196
Ohh!

796
01:22:45,905 --> 01:22:48,491
Oh, no!

797
01:23:00,629 --> 01:23:01,588
Oh...

798
01:23:01,589 --> 01:23:05,342
How can it be? I heard the bell.

799
01:23:05,718 --> 01:23:08,178
Did you not?

800
01:23:08,179 --> 01:23:10,765
I heard it plain.

801
01:23:10,974 --> 01:23:12,766
The bell rang.

802
01:23:12,767 --> 01:23:16,896
No, missy. A gust of wind
or a tremor on the ground.

803
01:23:17,606 --> 01:23:19,273
I'm sorry.

804
01:23:19,274 --> 01:23:21,483
But I heard it.

805
01:23:21,484 --> 01:23:24,486
Load this on. Sharp now!

806
01:23:24,487 --> 01:23:26,739
Come along.

807
01:23:26,948 --> 01:23:29,534
Steady. Steady now.

808
01:23:29,743 --> 01:23:32,329
Stand aside there.

809
01:23:32,538 --> 01:23:34,664
Careful.

810
01:23:34,665 --> 01:23:36,958
That's right.

811
01:23:36,959 --> 01:23:40,920
Over here. A little to
your right. Set it down.

812
01:23:40,921 --> 01:23:46,175
- There's more colour to you now.
- Yes, I feel much better now, thank you.

813
01:23:46,176 --> 01:23:48,177
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye, miss.

814
01:23:48,178 --> 01:23:53,059
- All right for you. I'll be in here with it.
- Rather you than me, mate!

815
01:23:55,729 --> 01:23:58,314
Oh, the stench!

816
01:24:49,909 --> 01:24:53,079
- Can you do it?
- I think so.

817
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,165
It's a long way back there.

818
01:24:55,166 --> 01:24:59,669
Five carriages, 30 feet each,
that's 150 feet altogether.

819
01:24:59,670 --> 01:25:01,170
I'll manage.

820
01:25:01,171 --> 01:25:05,383
- You're not going to get killed, are you?
- Oh, I'd rather not.

821
01:25:05,676 --> 01:25:07,010
Edward!

822
01:25:07,011 --> 01:25:11,181
- Edward Pierce, my dear fellow!
- Damn. Henry Fowler!

823
01:25:11,182 --> 01:25:13,726
He cannot travel in
our compartment.

824
01:25:13,727 --> 01:25:16,061
Henry, what a surprise!

825
01:25:16,062 --> 01:25:19,440
- Fancy seeing you! Are you on this train?
- Yes.

826
01:25:19,441 --> 01:25:21,734
As a matter of fact, so am I.

827
01:25:23,611 --> 01:25:28,908
Oh, forgive me. Miss Bridget
Lawson, Mr Henry Fowler.

828
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:33,037
Miss Lawson is accompanying
her deceased brother but...

829
01:25:33,038 --> 01:25:37,542
due to the new regulations she's
not permitted in the guard's van.

830
01:25:37,543 --> 01:25:41,046
Therefore she is
seeking a compartment.

831
01:25:42,339 --> 01:25:44,716
Well, mine is available.

832
01:25:46,468 --> 01:25:49,513
Henry, you're so kind.

833
01:25:51,266 --> 01:25:53,726
You won't join us, will you?

834
01:25:54,144 --> 01:25:58,272
As a matter of fact, I've...
made other arrangements.

835
01:26:00,066 --> 01:26:02,651
Oh, I see!

836
01:26:02,652 --> 01:26:06,280
- You're quite sure?
- Oh, yes.

837
01:26:06,281 --> 01:26:08,866
You carry on, Henry.

838
01:26:13,747 --> 01:26:15,373
Miss Lawson!

839
01:26:15,374 --> 01:26:18,668
- You're in capable hands.
- You're too kind.

840
01:26:18,669 --> 01:26:21,671
Not at all.

841
01:27:15,562 --> 01:27:18,522
Open up! Open up!

842
01:27:18,523 --> 01:27:21,108
Open up, damn you!

843
01:27:22,402 --> 01:27:24,194
Are you alive, then?

844
01:27:24,195 --> 01:27:26,697
Of course I am, you damnable flat.

845
01:27:26,698 --> 01:27:30,911
- Good God, he's alive!
- Open it! Hurry up. I must be quick!

846
01:27:33,914 --> 01:27:36,207
Lift up!

847
01:27:36,208 --> 01:27:38,794
Oh, mother of God!

848
01:27:39,128 --> 01:27:41,713
Oh, the smell!

849
01:27:42,548 --> 01:27:45,133
The things I must do!

850
01:27:48,971 --> 01:27:52,808
Do you have, er...
many gentlemen friends?

851
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:58,438
Oh, why sure enough. Gents are
ever so friendly to me, they are.

852
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:01,775
- Me mum said I was a heartbreaker.
- I'm certain you are.

853
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:07,781
Me mum was a heartbreaker herself.
Had many a caller, she did.

854
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:10,200
Many a caller.

855
01:28:10,201 --> 01:28:13,246
And always with some little token.

856
01:28:13,247 --> 01:28:16,708
Me mum says a man loves
you, he shows you proper.

857
01:28:16,709 --> 01:28:20,253
- With some little token.
- Quite so.

858
01:28:21,255 --> 01:28:25,759
If you will permit me, I should be
delighted to give you a "token" myself.

859
01:28:27,636 --> 01:28:31,640
- Cor, you're a bold gent!
- I'm most serious, I assure you.

860
01:28:31,641 --> 01:28:35,018
- What, here on the train?
- Why not?

861
01:28:35,019 --> 01:28:38,772
Have you not heard of the
50-mile-an-hour club?

862
01:28:38,773 --> 01:28:42,651
I'm told it's beneficial
to the circulation.

863
01:28:56,959 --> 01:29:00,128
- But the van's locked from outside.
- It's taken care of.

864
01:29:00,129 --> 01:29:02,839
- How?
- You'll see soon enough.

865
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:07,009
My friend will come over the top of the
train between Redhill and Ashford.

866
01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:10,263
That's the fastest part of the run!

867
01:29:10,264 --> 01:29:12,850
I suppose it is.

868
01:29:12,934 --> 01:29:17,188
What about all them bridges?
Your friend, mate, he's mad.

869
01:34:59,586 --> 01:35:02,380
- What's going on?
- Take the rope.

870
01:35:06,009 --> 01:35:08,386
- Is he up there now?
- He is.

871
01:35:08,387 --> 01:35:10,680
He's lucky to be alive.

872
01:35:10,681 --> 01:35:14,602
- Hold on.
- All right.

873
01:35:22,068 --> 01:35:24,653
Now let it go easy.

874
01:35:24,695 --> 01:35:27,281
Go on.

875
01:36:01,859 --> 01:36:04,653
I can't get over the feeling...

876
01:36:05,112 --> 01:36:07,197
You look very familiar.

877
01:36:07,198 --> 01:36:11,619
- Are you sure we've never met?
- Oh, no, sir.

878
01:36:13,664 --> 01:36:15,873
What does your mum do?

879
01:36:15,874 --> 01:36:18,668
Me mum? Er...

880
01:36:18,669 --> 01:36:21,254
She's a seamstress.

881
01:36:22,172 --> 01:36:24,757
An honourable trade.

882
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:30,722
Me mum's made dresses for Lady
Eversham herself, I'll have you know.

883
01:36:32,892 --> 01:36:35,853
I'm acquainted with Lady Eversham.

884
01:36:36,646 --> 01:36:38,981
Oh.

885
01:37:14,268 --> 01:37:16,353
- All done?
- Done.

886
01:37:16,354 --> 01:37:20,149
Good. We've got less than a minute.

887
01:37:29,492 --> 01:37:32,161
Bloody hell, you look a sight!

888
01:37:32,162 --> 01:37:34,205
I look a sight?

889
01:37:34,206 --> 01:37:37,292
No, but you're all covered in soot.

890
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,962
It's the smoke.

891
01:37:41,963 --> 01:37:45,633
- I haven't brought a change of clothing.
- That's brilliant.

892
01:37:45,634 --> 01:37:50,388
What are you going to wear
coming off Folkestone station?

893
01:37:52,350 --> 01:37:53,725
Oh, no!

894
01:37:53,726 --> 01:37:56,102
Oh, no!

895
01:37:56,103 --> 01:38:02,025
Bloody hell! You paint me green, make
me lie in a coffin with a dead cat...

896
01:38:02,026 --> 01:38:04,486
and now you strip
me bollock-naked. No!

897
01:38:04,487 --> 01:38:06,488
- Shut up.
- Bloody hell!

898
01:38:06,489 --> 01:38:08,740
Let's go!

899
01:38:27,427 --> 01:38:31,765
He'll take the river road
and meet us in Folkestone.

900
01:38:40,691 --> 01:38:46,405
Take hold of the rope. We'll be
through Ashford soon. Pull it.

901
01:38:49,992 --> 01:38:52,579
We'll pass Ashford soon.

902
01:41:05,634 --> 01:41:08,219
Best lock me up.

903
01:41:08,428 --> 01:41:12,808
- Sweet dreams.
- Not bloody likely.

904
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:35,748
Me mum told me the best gents were the
ones to watch. Full of tricks, they are.

905
01:41:35,957 --> 01:41:43,214
I knew of one caller, wanted me to come
to a room he had, full of whips and such.

906
01:41:43,423 --> 01:41:45,257
- Whips?
- Mm!

907
01:41:45,258 --> 01:41:47,426
Can you imagine!

908
01:41:47,427 --> 01:41:49,261
Mmm.

909
01:41:49,262 --> 01:41:53,934
- Well, me mum, she told me...
- My dear, my dear, my dearest!

910
01:41:54,393 --> 01:41:55,643
Oh!

911
01:41:55,644 --> 01:41:58,230
What a man you are!

912
01:41:59,482 --> 01:42:01,399
What do you take me for?

913
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:03,860
Aagh!

914
01:42:05,821 --> 01:42:08,407
Ohh!

915
01:43:04,215 --> 01:43:07,260
Impossible woman!

916
01:43:26,572 --> 01:43:27,488
Ha!

917
01:43:27,489 --> 01:43:31,160
Robbery indeed! The very idea!

918
01:44:53,163 --> 01:44:55,748
Arrest that man!

919
01:45:25,487 --> 01:45:29,365
The court thanks you for providing
us with so clear an explanation...

920
01:45:29,366 --> 01:45:32,036
of your manner in
committing the crime.

921
01:45:32,037 --> 01:45:35,831
I'm glad to be of help. The
police seemed to be confused.

922
01:45:35,832 --> 01:45:39,626
Do spare us your impoverished
witticisms, Mr Pierce.

923
01:45:39,627 --> 01:45:43,005
Your presence here attests
to their efficiency.

924
01:45:43,006 --> 01:45:45,966
You know, you are a
very unusual man.

925
01:45:45,967 --> 01:45:49,095
Mr Pierce, I put it
to you directly.

926
01:45:49,304 --> 01:45:53,224
Did you never feel at any time
some sense of impropriety,...

927
01:45:53,225 --> 01:45:55,894
some recognition of misconduct,...

928
01:45:55,895 --> 01:46:01,774
some comprehension of unlawful
behaviour, some moral misgivings...

929
01:46:01,775 --> 01:46:06,154
in the performance of these
various and sundry criminal acts?

930
01:46:06,155 --> 01:46:10,617
- I don't understand the question.
- Evidently not.

931
01:46:10,702 --> 01:46:14,663
Sir, it is a recognised
truth of jurisprudence...

932
01:46:14,664 --> 01:46:17,416
that laws are created by men...

933
01:46:17,417 --> 01:46:21,462
and that civilised men, in a tradition
of more than two millennia,...

934
01:46:21,463 --> 01:46:26,758
agree to abide by these laws for
the common good of all society.

935
01:46:26,759 --> 01:46:28,760
For it is only by
the rule of law...

936
01:46:28,761 --> 01:46:35,560
that any civilisation holds itself above
the promiscuous squalor of barbarism.

937
01:46:35,561 --> 01:46:39,105
Now, on the matter
of motive, we ask you:

938
01:46:39,106 --> 01:46:43,450
why did you conceive,
plan and execute...

939
01:46:43,451 --> 01:46:47,347
this dastardly and
scandalous crime?

940
01:46:52,454 --> 01:46:55,039
I wanted the money.

941
01:47:05,216 --> 01:47:07,802
He'll get 20 years for that.

942
01:47:55,311 --> 01:47:58,104
What the hell are you waiting for?
