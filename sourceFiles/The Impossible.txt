<i>On December 26th, 2004, the deadliest tsunami
on record hit the South East Coast of Asia.</i>

00:01:04,093 --> 00:01:09,665
<i>The lives of countless families all
over the world changed forever.</i>

3
00:01:12,286 --> 00:01:20,246
<i>This is the true story of
one of those families.</i>

4
00:02:11,927 --> 00:02:13,269
Oh, God!

5
00:02:13,727 --> 00:02:14,782
Did you....

6
00:02:15,724 --> 00:02:20,164
- ...Did you set the alarm before we left?
- Yes, the last thing I did!

7
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:27,757
No, I was the last one to leave.

8
00:02:28,012 --> 00:02:30,122
I was the last one to leave
and I'm sure I didn't set it.

9
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:33,049
No darling, I was the last one out...

10
00:02:33,257 --> 00:02:35,060
and I did, I promise.

11
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,217
- Are you sure?
- Yep!

12
00:02:37,704 --> 00:02:38,855
Okay!

13
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:44,669
No, no, I was the last one
'cause I went back in.

14
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:46,377
And that means the alarm is not set.

15
00:02:46,794 --> 00:02:47,655
Cause I didn't set it.

16
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:51,623
Well, I guess that means that we be coming
home to a large bunch of hippies...

17
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:53,129
...sleeping in our bed.

18
00:02:53,187 --> 00:02:54,707
Well, just like your old college days.

19
00:02:58,982 --> 00:03:00,757
It's just turbulence, Maria.

20
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,480
<i>Please Turn Off Electronic Devices.</i>

21
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,524

<i>The local time is 1:30 in the afternoon...</i>

23
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:11,714
What are you doing? It's time to sit down,
we are about to land, darling.

24
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,490
Lucas won't talk to me.

25
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:15,330
<i>Please fasten your seatbelts...</i>

26
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:16,998
<i>...and return your seat to
the upright position.</i>

27
00:03:17,065 --> 00:03:18,311
Take my seat.

28
00:03:19,762 --> 00:03:23,790
- What did I do? I didn't do anything.
- You're all right, just sit down and stop worrying.

29
00:03:24,557 --> 00:03:25,669
Buckle up!

30
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:30,884
Sit down please, madam!

31
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:32,726
Lucas.

32
00:03:36,246 --> 00:03:37,684
- Lucas.
- What?!

33
00:03:37,746 --> 00:03:41,151
You know you could try being a bit nicer to
your brother, he's just scared.

34
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,126
- So what else is new, everything scares him?
- Buckle!

35
00:03:47,635 --> 00:03:50,080
I wonder who he takes off, though.

<i>KHAOLAK, THAILAND CHRISTMAS EVE</i>

37
00:04:14,908 --> 00:04:17,172
Take your stuff, don't forget any bags.

38
00:04:19,804 --> 00:04:21,434
Have you been to Kalka before?

39
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:23,046
No, it's our first time.

40
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:25,495
This is the best holiday season ever.

41
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,716
The Holidays starts to full,
but this area, it's really quiet.

42
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:29,950
Great for families.

43
00:04:30,314 --> 00:04:33,361
The archaistic arch is brand new,
which just opened a week ago.

44
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:34,850
- You'll love it here.
- All right.

45
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:39,355
I'm sorry, but we made a booking
on the third floor, the sea view room.

46
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:41,739
I know. We are sorry,
that was a mistake.

47
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:42,845
But we feel...

48
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,094
you might like this better.

49
00:04:47,577 --> 00:04:49,207
- Where do you come from?
- Japan.

50
00:04:49,475 --> 00:04:50,914
You don't look Japanese.

51
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:54,921
No, well, I work for a big company there,
and we moved around a lot, you know.

52
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:56,609
And you, you don't work?

53
00:04:56,669 --> 00:04:58,538
I'm a doctor.

54
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:02,323
Not practicing right now.
Just taking care of the kids.

55
00:05:02,465 --> 00:05:05,216
I see, you got promoted.

56
00:05:08,955 --> 00:05:10,778
Well, that's nice, isn't it?

57
00:05:10,874 --> 00:05:12,082
- Mom!
- Yes.

58
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:15,614
- Can I have one of these, please?
- Lucas, if you are thirsty, would you just...

59
00:05:15,908 --> 00:05:19,494
- Use your bottled water.
- Exactly.

60
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:22,330
- Boys, come and see this.
- Come on.

61
00:05:22,443 --> 00:05:23,518
Look.

62
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:27,848
- I will hand it,
- Oh!

63
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:29,376
Isn't it great?

64
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:33,132
- Dad, can we go swimming there?
- Yeah, we could go swimming, yeah.

Go!
Go!

70
00:06:29,778 --> 00:06:30,833
Wow!

71
00:06:47,461 --> 00:06:49,091
Now my name is coming up.

72
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,653
- Is it?
- Is it? It is going up.

73
00:06:52,855 --> 00:06:55,732
It's going a different way than the others.

74
00:06:56,952 --> 00:06:58,294
Yeah!
Yeah!

75
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:02,163
- It's catching up.
- Yeah, it's catching up.

76
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:04,357
Look at that!
It's going up directly.

77
00:08:12,878 --> 00:08:13,981
Good morning.

78
00:08:15,174 --> 00:08:16,805
Good morning.

79
00:08:17,073 --> 00:08:18,223
Ahh!
Here up!

80
00:08:18,782 --> 00:08:20,498
- Wake up!
- What are you doing?

81
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,963
Please help!

82
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:26,253
- It's Christmas morning.
- Help! Need some help, please!

83
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:29,113
I go to my gift place in this way.

84
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:31,087
- Oh, I need to go outside!
- No, no, no.

85
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,187
- Here I go!
- Wait, wait, wait! One at a time!

86
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:39,298
Oh!

87
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:40,693
Oh, a telescope.

88
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:44,297
A set complete and over stars
in that you can stick on the ceiling.

89
00:08:44,445 --> 00:08:46,029
- The whole moves away.
- I arrange it on top.

90
00:08:46,145 --> 00:08:48,734
- Oh, look!
- Oh, pool scarf!

91
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:50,475
I love it!

92
00:08:51,609 --> 00:08:54,322
Thank you darling.
I mean Santa Claus.

93
00:08:54,438 --> 00:08:57,219
What about you man?
A ball!

94
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,660
Oh, yeah!

95
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:09,527
Goal!

96
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,959
I can't get sleep.

97
00:10:13,661 --> 00:10:18,341
- Tomorrow I get lost!
- Yeah. Sure.

98
00:10:21,252 --> 00:10:24,503
Can we go outside and watch the stars?

99
00:10:26,248 --> 00:10:27,945
We'll get tomorrow.

100
00:10:32,054 --> 00:10:34,825
Just close your eyes and
think of something nice.

101
00:10:56,918 --> 00:10:59,987
Mom, would you go play ball with me?

102
00:11:00,165 --> 00:11:02,371
In a minute, darling, play with Lucas.

103
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:15,564
- I can't believe you, the post list!
- What?

104
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,862
I hide that thing and I forget
where I put it.

105
00:11:17,998 --> 00:11:22,218
I am on it just to check in to see if there
is a message filled later on in Japan.

106
00:11:22,444 --> 00:11:24,016
Liar.

107
00:11:29,686 --> 00:11:31,985
There should be about text
saying that O'Neil should...

108
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,403
have been given us two years of extension
on this contract.

109
00:11:34,683 --> 00:11:37,176
Which means the two of us are
doing the same job.

110
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:40,980
- That can only really mean one thing.
- They can't fire you.

111
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,232
That would be too expensive.
Don't worry!

112
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:48,247
Well, I do worry. Because we can't
afford to lose this job, can we?

113
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:57,143
I can go back to work.

114
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,820
- Maybe it's time.
- In Japan?

115
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,245
No.

116
00:12:03,553 --> 00:12:04,944
Oh, you want to go home?

117
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,541
It's not the worst idea, is it?

118
00:12:13,443 --> 00:12:17,596
Well, you should think about it. But I'm
going to play with the boys now, so...

119
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,655
Here, Dad!

120
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:31,210
It can't be over ward.

121
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,804
Awful, in our pool.

122
00:12:41,657 --> 00:12:43,057
Catch it!

123
00:12:56,352 --> 00:12:57,647
Oh, no!

124
00:12:57,802 --> 00:12:59,672
Go get it, Lucas!
Come on!

125
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:52,184
Give me the wallet!

126
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:55,325
- Lucas!
- Dad!

127
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,238
Lucas!

128
00:14:56,885 --> 00:14:59,638
God!

129
00:15:03,728 --> 00:15:06,653
God!

130
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,820
Mom!

131
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:37,570
Help!

132
00:15:40,443 --> 00:15:43,320
- Lucas!
- Mom!

133
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,083
Lucas!

134
00:15:50,832 --> 00:15:55,493
- Lucas!
- Mom, help me!

135
00:16:01,323 --> 00:16:02,953
Get me out of danger!

136
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:08,923
Help!

137
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:14,785
Mom! Help!

138
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:16,765
Mom!

139
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:19,324
Lucas, stay there.

140
00:16:19,705 --> 00:16:21,239
- Stop!
- Lucas!

141
00:16:22,104 --> 00:16:24,405
Mama, help!

142
00:16:27,897 --> 00:16:29,911
Mama, take a look.

143
00:16:30,294 --> 00:16:31,732
Lucas!

144
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,978
Look at that post!

145
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:38,455
Mama, were you all right?

146
00:16:40,384 --> 00:16:41,679
Lucas!

147
00:16:42,282 --> 00:16:43,260
Wait!

148
00:16:44,981 --> 00:16:46,611
Mom!

149
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:51,734
Help!

150
00:16:52,773 --> 00:16:53,971
Somebody to help!

151
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:56,467
- Get my hand!
- No! No!

152
00:17:10,306 --> 00:17:12,656
Come on!
Come on!

153
00:17:13,252 --> 00:17:14,691
- Help!
- Lucas!

154
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,205
No!

155
00:17:22,346 --> 00:17:23,449
Come on!

156
00:17:24,431 --> 00:17:26,982
Lucas!
Lucas!

157
00:17:34,332 --> 00:17:35,675
Lucas!

158
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:38,823
Help!
No! No!

159
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,337
Help!

160
00:17:42,384 --> 00:17:46,738
- Lucas!
- Help! Ah... hh!

161
00:18:19,689 --> 00:18:21,319
Lucas!

162
00:18:24,832 --> 00:18:26,702
Come on, Lucas!

163
00:18:55,054 --> 00:18:57,365
Mom!

164
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:05,326
Mom! Dad!

165
00:19:11,738 --> 00:19:13,080
Help!

166
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:18,786
Mom, Mom.

167
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,509
Mom! Mom! Mom!

168
00:19:28,322 --> 00:19:30,000
Mom!

169
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:33,907
Mom!

170
00:19:35,116 --> 00:19:37,322
Stop, Mom! Stop!

171
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,700
Please.

172
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,652
Never do that to me again, Mom.

173
00:19:44,106 --> 00:19:50,158
- Mom! Never do that to me again, Mom.
- I'm here.

174
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,785
Perhaps you can be over there.

175
00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:05,782
- Come on! Come up that tree, that tree over there.
- Yes, yes.

176
00:20:06,045 --> 00:20:08,903
That is perfect. That is perfect.

177
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:16,191
Oh, look, please! Please, don't!
Don't move!

178
00:20:19,062 --> 00:20:21,537
Stay very still.

179
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:28,723
I was a brave kid mom,...
but I was scared.

180
00:20:45,747 --> 00:20:47,349
I'm scared, too.

181
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:55,904
Where is everybody?

182
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,534
I don't know, dear!
I don't know.

183
00:21:59,175 --> 00:22:01,169
Mom.

184
00:22:05,609 --> 00:22:07,412
What?

185
00:22:07,597 --> 00:22:09,439
You're bleeding, Mom.

186
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,848
Oh, my God!
Oh!

187
00:22:36,878 --> 00:22:38,249
It's okay.

188
00:22:38,587 --> 00:22:41,320
- I can't see you like this.
- It's okay.

189
00:22:41,535 --> 00:22:43,511
I'm...
Is it?

190
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:49,194
You go first.

191
00:23:28,988 --> 00:23:31,290
The tree there, the big one.

192
00:23:31,586 --> 00:23:34,626
You think we can climb it?

193
00:24:05,452 --> 00:24:07,131
Okay, let's go.

194
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,135
<i>Dad!</i>

195
00:24:24,534 --> 00:24:26,020
<i>Dad!</i>

196
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:29,415
Wait!
Did you hear that?

197
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,431
- Mom, there's nothing we can do.
- Wait!

198
00:24:32,626 --> 00:24:34,638
We are almost there.
We have to get the safety.

199
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,969
No, we have to help that poor-

200
00:24:36,022 --> 00:24:39,044
Mom, if another wave catches us
down here, we will die.

201
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,849
We have to climb
that tree right now.

202
00:24:42,178 --> 00:24:43,664
Come on.

203
00:24:44,146 --> 00:24:48,327
- Where are you?
- Mom, look at you, we need help!

204
00:24:48,811 --> 00:24:50,729
We cannot risk it.

205
00:24:52,607 --> 00:24:55,148
We can't risk it mom. Come on.

206
00:24:55,904 --> 00:24:57,141
Listen.

207
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,560
What if that boy was Simon or Thomas?

208
00:25:02,728 --> 00:25:04,848
What if they needed help?

209
00:25:05,145 --> 00:25:08,645
- You want someone to help them, wouldn't you?
- Simon and Thomas are dead!

210
00:25:27,174 --> 00:25:30,003
Even it's the last thing we do.

211
00:25:34,965 --> 00:25:37,459
Where are you?

212
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,815
<i>Dad!</i>

213
00:25:48,253 --> 00:25:50,813
Look there, Mama, I see.

214
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:03,854
Are you okay?

215
00:26:07,954 --> 00:26:09,690
Okay, okay.

216
00:26:14,028 --> 00:26:15,744
What's your name?

217
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:19,832
I'm Lucas, what's your name?

218
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:22,052
- Daniel.
- Okay, Daniel.

219
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:24,500
To be up here, we gonna get you out, okay?

220
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,283
Lift him.

221
00:26:27,355 --> 00:26:30,041
It's all right. It's all right.

222
00:26:31,511 --> 00:26:33,026
Are you okay?

223
00:27:08,275 --> 00:27:09,464
OK!

224
00:27:10,373 --> 00:27:11,821
Are you okay?

225
00:27:13,121 --> 00:27:17,648
It’s okay, honey!
Come on!

226
00:27:18,366 --> 00:27:21,051
Just stay here, I'll be back.

227
00:27:27,956 --> 00:27:32,204
- Mom, I'm coming down, give me a second.
- No, I can do it.

228
00:27:32,393 --> 00:27:35,308
- Mom, I'm coming down.
- I can do it, Lucas!

229
00:27:35,868 --> 00:27:38,362
Just stay there, please.

230
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,640
Mom. Mom.

231
00:29:32,197 --> 00:29:34,105
Thank you.
Thank!

232
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,712
Did you hear that?

233
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,210
Mama, look. They are coming for us.

234
00:33:16,518 --> 00:33:19,779
Hey, over here!

235
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,415
Hey!

236
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,376
Climb down, Lucas.

237
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:28,870
Oh, look!

238
00:33:32,002 --> 00:33:34,102
Oh, no!

239
00:33:51,445 --> 00:33:54,052
No, no, no!

240
00:33:54,161 --> 00:33:56,079
Wait!

241
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,893
- Lucas?
- Mom, I'm here.

242
00:35:56,161 --> 00:35:57,120
Thanks!

243
00:36:02,258 --> 00:36:06,909
Thank you. Thank you.

244
00:36:10,798 --> 00:36:12,985
Thank you so much.

245
00:36:13,446 --> 00:36:14,788
Oh!

246
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:20,295
My boy!

247
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:24,000
I cannot see them, my boys.

248
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,288
My boys.

249
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,051
Lucas!

250
00:36:48,311 --> 00:36:49,558
Lucas!

251
00:37:03,198 --> 00:37:05,210
Do not let them take me
anywhere without you.

252
00:37:05,295 --> 00:37:08,787
Don't worry Mom.
I will not leave you alone. I promise.

253
00:37:13,787 --> 00:37:15,292
All right!

254
00:37:17,534 --> 00:37:20,017
Where is Daniel? What about Daniel?

255
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:20,514
Daniel?

256
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:22,430
Lucas, where is Daniel?

257
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:25,429
I don't know.

258
00:39:37,848 --> 00:39:38,903
Thanks!

259
00:39:40,747 --> 00:39:42,137
Thank you!

260
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:01,342
- It's very cold in here.
- It's not cold, Mom.

261
00:40:06,749 --> 00:40:08,178
Mom.

262
00:40:10,216 --> 00:40:11,751
Mom, what's wrong?

263
00:40:12,585 --> 00:40:15,606
I need some antibiotics.
Look in the cupboard.

264
00:40:20,547 --> 00:40:22,810
I can't read the labels.
They're all in Thai.

265
00:40:22,905 --> 00:40:26,261
It got to be labeled.
Oh, look at the side.

266
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:28,131
- OK!
- Let me look, Lucas.

267
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:33,238
Oh, thank God!

268
00:40:33,293 --> 00:40:34,118
Oh, thanks!

269
00:40:35,692 --> 00:40:37,102
See that, boy?

270
00:40:37,889 --> 00:40:40,823
I'm all he's got in the world.
Do you understand?

271
00:40:41,586 --> 00:40:45,144
I'm a doctor, too.
I'm bleeding. You've got to stop it.

272
00:40:46,082 --> 00:40:48,949
Please, I need some antibiotics.
Please help.

273
00:41:14,654 --> 00:41:19,008
- Are you okay?
- I lost my husband and two children.

274
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:23,997
If something happens to me...

275
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:58,026
What color is it?

276
00:41:58,512 --> 00:42:01,178
- What?
- My leg.

277
00:42:02,707 --> 00:42:07,147
- Still red?
- Yes, it's still red.

278
00:42:08,702 --> 00:42:11,273
- What does that mean?
- It's good.

279
00:42:11,689 --> 00:42:14,278
As long as it doesn't turn black.

280
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:20,921
You need to eat something.

281
00:42:21,888 --> 00:42:24,036
Eat it.

282
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:34,826
- Don't bossy!
- I wonder who I take after.

283
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:48,202
Hello!

284
00:42:49,862 --> 00:42:52,116
What's your name?

285
00:42:55,755 --> 00:43:01,346
My name is Maria, and this is my son, Lucas.
What's your name?

286
00:43:09,143 --> 00:43:11,723
Hey, give her some tangerine.

287
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,057
She must be starving!

288
00:43:25,027 --> 00:43:26,475
Be careful!

289
00:43:30,022 --> 00:43:33,177
Turn your head to the side, please.
You'll choke if you don't.

290
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:36,541
Please, please!
She needs help.

291
00:43:36,716 --> 00:43:40,456
Turn her head!
Help her, Lucas, help her!

292
00:43:48,056 --> 00:43:49,455
Mom, are you okay?

293
00:43:49,514 --> 00:43:52,189
Mom, Mom are you okay?

294
00:43:52,302 --> 00:43:53,817
What are you doing?

295
00:43:54,797 --> 00:43:56,217
Mom, are you okay?

296
00:43:59,694 --> 00:44:02,283
Mom, stop it, stop it!
That's enough!

297
00:44:02,591 --> 00:44:05,017
Mom, stop it! Mom!

298
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:09,362
Mom, stop it!

299
00:44:50,344 --> 00:44:54,314
Francisca!
Francisca!

300
00:45:11,624 --> 00:45:18,462
Lucas, look at this place.
They're so busy in here.

301
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:22,063
You got to go and do something.

302
00:45:22,913 --> 00:45:26,078
Go and help people.
You're good at it.

303
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:32,251
- What do you want me to do?
- Just something. Anything.

304
00:45:34,701 --> 00:45:35,756
Will you be alright?

305
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:41,147
Come on, Lucas!
I'm not going anywhere.

306
00:45:43,193 --> 00:45:45,600
- I promise.
- Okay.

307
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:19,369
It's your family?

308
00:46:19,429 --> 00:46:21,347
Adolph, Joseph, Walton.

309
00:46:21,756 --> 00:46:24,681
- You're looking for your family?
- Have you seen them, Benstrom?

310
00:46:24,852 --> 00:46:28,064
Okay, calm down!
I will help you. Okay?

311
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,276
I... I just... looking... Joseph.

312
00:46:32,545 --> 00:46:35,278
I'll try to help you. Okay.

Okay.

Are you Benstrom?

315
00:46:41,435 --> 00:46:43,171
Are you Benstrom?

316
00:46:44,783 --> 00:46:48,044
Excuse, I need to access
to Morten Benstrom?

317
00:46:48,231 --> 00:46:49,669
Morten Benstrom?

318
00:46:49,829 --> 00:46:52,208
Excuse me!
Excuse me!

319
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:55,330
I'm looking for my... my son.

320
00:46:55,422 --> 00:46:58,126
- Your son?
- Peter Barry.

321
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,476
- Yes. He'll be wondering where I am.
- OK!

322
00:47:03,217 --> 00:47:05,087
Peter Barry?

323
00:47:06,311 --> 00:47:07,462
Morten Benstrom?

324
00:47:07,941 --> 00:47:12,371
Morten Benstrom?
Peter Barry? Joseph?...

00:47:17,152 --> 00:47:18,591
Sorry, what's her name again?

Yes, your papa is here.

- I'll bring him here. Okay?
- Yes.

341
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:27,370
No, no, no, you need to stay here.

342
00:48:27,684 --> 00:48:30,034
I will bring your papa here. Okay?

343
00:48:30,232 --> 00:48:32,723
No! No, you have to stay here,
you have to stay here,

344
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:35,418
because it's a very long way, and you
you have to rest. Okay?

345
00:48:35,725 --> 00:48:36,780
Okay?

346

Okay.

Where is my mom?

Mom?

350
00:50:30,165 --> 00:50:31,411
Mom?

351
00:50:33,111 --> 00:50:35,230
Mom!

352
00:50:37,498 --> 00:50:40,182
No, no, what are you doing?

353
00:50:40,295 --> 00:50:43,201
This is my mom's bed! Get off!

354
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,055
- Get off!
- OK, come on!

355
00:50:48,397 --> 00:50:52,761
- It's okay! Take it easy, boy!

00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:02,818
Look! You have to come with me.
I will help you.

357
00:51:03,013 --> 00:51:04,231
Okay?

358
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:07,874
Okay.

359
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:50,610
What's your name?

360
00:51:54,233 --> 00:51:58,069
- What's your name?
- Lucas Bennett.

361
00:52:00,328 --> 00:52:03,042
Where were you staying?

362
00:52:03,824 --> 00:52:05,070
Staying in... uh...

363
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:10,617
In, the Orchid beach resort in Khaolak.

364
00:52:10,847 --> 00:52:12,947
Was somebody else traveling with you?

365
00:52:15,722 --> 00:52:16,757
Lucas?

366
00:52:18,709 --> 00:52:21,299
My dad, and my two little brothers.

367
00:52:24,405 --> 00:52:27,080
Do you know what happened to them?

368
00:52:31,197 --> 00:52:35,129
- Is there somebody we could call?
- Uh... uh...

369
00:52:36,742 --> 00:52:38,275
My granddad.

370
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,635
What's his name?

371
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:44,383
Bryan, but...
But I don't remember his number.

372
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,703
Lucas?

373
00:54:57,055 --> 00:54:58,599
Lucas?

374
00:55:09,344 --> 00:55:11,186
<i>Maria?</i>

375
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,335
<i>Maria?</i>

376
00:55:15,667 --> 00:55:17,489
Lucas?

377
00:55:20,932 --> 00:55:22,342
Lucas?

378
00:55:22,731 --> 00:55:24,841
Maria!

379
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:30,188
Lucas!

380
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:35,969
Maria!

381
00:57:05,181 --> 00:57:07,521
Hey man! You all right?

382
00:57:08,128 --> 00:57:10,813
It seems till I hear me.

383
00:57:11,725 --> 00:57:13,161
I'll be up in a second.

384
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:16,052
Don't even bother, they are sending
trucks to the mountains.

385
00:57:16,321 --> 00:57:19,082
- Just staying on time, alright? They'll be here soon.
- Yes, I know.

386
00:57:20,217 --> 00:57:23,728
- Can you tell them I'm back?
- Yeah, sure. Hold on.

387
00:57:29,407 --> 00:57:32,503
<i>Hey boys, your dad is back!</i>

388
00:57:32,634 --> 00:57:35,443
<i>- Dad! Dad!
- Dad!</i>

389
00:57:35,562 --> 00:57:37,787
- Dad!
- Dad!

390
00:57:38,298 --> 00:57:38,776
Hey!

391
00:57:38,797 --> 00:57:41,339
Out the hallway
a helicopter just flew by.

392
00:57:41,496 --> 00:57:43,528
- Did they?
- Yeah!

393
00:57:43,613 --> 00:57:45,234
Mom and Lucas...

394
00:57:46,991 --> 00:57:48,957
Why don't you come
down here a minute, Thomas?

395
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,144
What about me?

396
00:57:50,188 --> 00:57:53,017
You stay and see if you can see
any more helicopters. Is that's okay?

397
00:57:53,235 --> 00:57:55,172
- Okay.
- Good boy!

398
00:57:57,879 --> 00:57:59,778
You're almost stepped right.

399
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:02,063
You got it?

400
00:58:02,654 --> 00:58:03,614
Oh!

401
00:58:04,972 --> 00:58:06,037
Oh!

402
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:09,251
Oh, my God!

403
00:58:11,567 --> 00:58:13,850
I can't find them.

404
00:58:14,763 --> 00:58:16,988
Did you see a lot of dead people?

405
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:21,777
While I'm a very serious commenter.

406
00:58:22,357 --> 00:58:26,135
- Not mom and Lucas, right?
- No, I didn't see them.

407
00:58:28,231 --> 00:58:31,990
I bumped my feet on the
reef, that was really hot.

408
00:58:32,196 --> 00:58:34,258
- Everyone was leaving.
- Sure.

409
00:58:34,346 --> 00:58:35,650
Can we leave yet?

410
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:41,776
I need you to them...

411
00:58:42,037 --> 00:58:44,281
I need you to do me a favor, Thomas.

412
00:58:44,734 --> 00:58:48,944
It's time everyone going to the mountains,
seek to a shelter where it should be safe,

413
00:58:53,827 --> 00:58:55,263
but I can't go with you.

414
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:57,291
You can't leave us alone again, Dad.

415
00:58:57,422 --> 00:58:59,436
I have to keep looking for them, you see?

416
00:58:59,571 --> 00:59:01,585
- You have to look after Simon.
- No!

417
00:59:01,678 --> 00:59:04,592
No, stay with us,
I can't look...

418
00:59:04,715 --> 00:59:07,400
I've never looked after someone before.

419
00:59:07,562 --> 00:59:10,037
- I'm scared.
- I know, I know.

420
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:12,780
I'm scared too.

421
00:59:14,305 --> 00:59:18,668
But you know, you know, the most
scary bit for me...

422
00:59:20,501 --> 00:59:22,803
- When the water hit.
- No.

423
00:59:23,047 --> 00:59:26,836
After that, when I
came up, I was on my own.

424
00:59:27,044 --> 00:59:29,192
That was the scariest part.

425
00:59:29,392 --> 00:59:32,883
And then I saw the two of
you climbing to the tree in there.

426
00:59:33,238 --> 00:59:37,035
I didn't feel so scared anymore,
because I knew I wasn't on my own. You see?

427
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:42,044
What if Mommy and Lucas
are on their own right now...

428
00:59:42,928 --> 00:59:44,319
Imagine how scared they'll be.

429
00:59:44,379 --> 00:59:50,362
- We'll look for those in camps-
- No! Thomas, you have to look after Simon.

430
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,403
And I'm going to keep looking for them.

431
00:59:54,746 --> 00:59:56,194
Okay?

432
00:59:58,363 --> 00:59:59,945
Okay?

433
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,970
Do you understand?

434
01:00:30,781 --> 01:00:32,076
Hello.

435
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,198
Yeah, I hear you.

436
01:00:34,877 --> 01:00:36,891
I'll be looking for him.

437
01:00:37,575 --> 01:00:39,224
Are you alright? Have you lost someone?

438
01:00:39,314 --> 01:00:41,404
We're fine.
We just want to get out of here.

439
01:00:44,868 --> 01:00:47,311
Excuse me. I've been trying
to place a call back home.

440
01:00:47,415 --> 01:00:49,696
I wonder if I could use
your phone? It will be very quick.

441
01:00:49,963 --> 01:00:52,071
Look around you man, everybody's
needing something right now.

442
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,904
But our battery is almost dead,
and we need the phone.

443
01:01:11,392 --> 01:01:13,023
I'll see you in the morning. Okay?

444
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:16,535
- You're not you coming?
- No, I'm not coming.

445
01:01:17,166 --> 01:01:19,141
Thomas will take care of you, all right?

446
01:01:20,004 --> 01:01:25,689
Listen to me, you can behave yourselves, okay?
And you need to stay with this group.

447
01:01:25,927 --> 01:01:28,921
And I'm going to be with you just
as soon as I can. Okay?

448
01:01:29,973 --> 01:01:32,141
You gonna behave yourselves. Okay?

449
01:01:33,871 --> 01:01:35,089
I love you.

450
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:41,935
- Will you have my boys for me, please?
- Just come with us.

451
01:01:42,062 --> 01:01:44,277
You know it's useless.

452
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:47,003
I can't stop looking.

453
01:01:51,352 --> 01:01:54,430
I love you.
I'll see you tomorrow, I promise.

454
01:01:55,161 --> 01:01:56,254
I love you.

455
01:02:16,029 --> 01:02:18,456
<i>Maria</i>

456
01:02:20,726 --> 01:02:22,864
<i>Lucas!</i>

457
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:33,994
<i>Maria!</i>

458
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:49,538
Lucas!

459
01:02:56,390 --> 01:02:58,165
Oh, no!
No!

460
01:03:14,372 --> 01:03:16,607
Hey man, are you okay?

461
01:03:19,568 --> 01:03:21,851
Get in the car. We will drive
you somewhere safer.

462
01:03:27,759 --> 01:03:31,404
My wife didn't want to come
to Thailand for Christmas holidays.

463
01:03:33,706 --> 01:03:35,096
Because of my leg.

464
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:43,228
I insisted, my little girl, Ginna.

465
01:03:45,642 --> 01:03:47,464
She's just two.

466
01:03:47,941 --> 01:03:50,146
The noise woke me up.

467
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:52,109
I was alone in the room.

468
01:03:54,084 --> 01:03:57,776
I went out to the terrace and saw the
sea coming in land.

469
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:04,414
It took me five seconds to reach the
stairs, but the water was already there.

470
01:04:04,824 --> 01:04:07,845
It was not more than five seconds.

471
01:04:08,072 --> 01:04:14,823
On the bed, I found a note from my
wife saying they were at the beach.

472
01:04:20,588 --> 01:04:23,628
- You're at the Orchid, right?
- Yeah.

473
01:04:28,001 --> 01:04:31,358
My whole family was around the
swimming-pool when the water hit.

474
01:04:33,696 --> 01:04:37,849
I found my middle son first, Thomas, he
was on top of this really tall tree.

475
01:04:39,191 --> 01:04:42,883
It took me forever to convince him to come
down, because he was so scared, you know.

476
01:04:43,686 --> 01:04:48,942
And I found my little one, Simon,
he was holding on top of a palm tree.

477
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:51,356
He's only five.

478
01:04:55,075 --> 01:04:56,811
I sent them to the mountains.

479
01:04:59,222 --> 01:05:03,778
You know, so that I can keep looking
for my wife and my oldest son.

480
01:05:08,033 --> 01:05:10,364
Toughest choice I ever made.

481
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:13,916
- Have you called home yet?
- I can't find a phone.

482
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:24,658
I'm saving my battery,
just in case, my family calls.

483
01:05:25,545 --> 01:05:27,051
Please.

484
01:05:27,943 --> 01:05:31,088
Thank you!
I will be very quick, I promise.

485
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:43,663
<i>- Yes?
- Bryan?</i>

486
01:05:43,728 --> 01:05:46,891
<i>Yes Henry, thank God!
How are you doing?</i>

487
01:05:47,025 --> 01:05:50,526
<i>- Did you hear from anyone yet?
- No Henry, you're the first call.</i>

488
01:05:50,721 --> 01:05:54,461
<i>Is everyone all right?...
Henry?</i>

489
01:05:54,667 --> 01:05:56,250
Maria and Lucas are not here.

490
01:05:56,615 --> 01:05:58,342
<i>What do you mean, not there?</i>

491
01:05:59,512 --> 01:06:01,987
The wave came and swept everyone away.

492
01:06:02,909 --> 01:06:07,992
I found Thomas and Simon,
but not Maria and Lucas!...

493
01:06:10,502 --> 01:06:13,283
I don't know what to do or
where to look for them!

494
01:06:13,898 --> 01:06:16,679
<i>Henry. You have to calm down!</i>

495
01:06:17,046 --> 01:06:21,841
<i>Henry? Henry?
- I have to go. Many people need this phone, okay?</i>

496
01:06:22,292 --> 01:06:24,728
<i>- I will call you later.
- Henry?</i>

497
01:06:40,672 --> 01:06:43,242
Sorry, sorry.

498
01:06:44,769 --> 01:06:45,834
Thank you.

499
01:06:59,405 --> 01:07:03,222
- What do you want me to do?
- You can't leave it like that.

500
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:07,423
- Go on, come on.
- Go on!

501
01:07:09,846 --> 01:07:12,685
Come on man, come on!

502
01:07:15,877 --> 01:07:17,546
Keep call him back.

503
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:26,680
<i>- Yes, Henry?
- Bryan, it's me again. Look...</i>

504
01:07:26,828 --> 01:07:29,609
I promise you I won't stop
looking until I find them. OK?

505
01:07:29,825 --> 01:07:30,254
<i>- Okay!</i>

506
01:07:30,273 --> 01:07:33,103
I don't know what to do,
because it's nighttime now, but I'll....

507
01:07:33,271 --> 01:07:36,578
I'll look in all hospitals, and I'll
look in all shelters find everything OK.

508
01:07:36,717 --> 01:07:38,778
And I'll... I will find
them, I promise you that.

509
01:07:38,864 --> 01:07:40,495
<i>- I'll call you when I do.
- Okay.</i>

510
01:07:40,564 --> 01:07:42,798
<i>- OK!
- OK!</i>

511
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:47,094
Thank you.

512
01:07:51,604 --> 01:07:53,397
Can I go with you?

513
01:08:08,987 --> 01:08:13,878
- I'm scared.
- Close of your eyes, and think of something nice.

514
01:08:24,671 --> 01:08:26,618
May I sit with you?

515
01:08:43,654 --> 01:08:45,169
How old are you?

516
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:50,948
Almost seventy-four.
And you?

517
01:08:51,146 --> 01:08:53,160
Seven and a half.

518
01:08:54,343 --> 01:08:57,882
You can't drop me.

519
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:01,499
- Is he alright?
- Yeah, he'll be alright.

520
01:09:02,015 --> 01:09:04,787
With a blanket on him, he's alright.

521
01:09:10,428 --> 01:09:12,682
You like looking at stars, don't you?

522
01:09:13,223 --> 01:09:17,031
I do, stars like Alaska constellations.

523
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:20,472
Here, the sky is different.

524
01:09:22,715 --> 01:09:28,796
Some of those stars have been
burned out for a long, long time.

525
01:09:30,008 --> 01:09:31,533
Did you know that?

526
01:09:33,205 --> 01:09:34,951
They're dead, aren't they?

527
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:43,715
They're dead, but once
they were so bright...

528
01:09:43,904 --> 01:09:47,616
That their light is still
travelling through space.

529
01:09:47,781 --> 01:09:50,418
And we can still see them.

530
01:09:51,188 --> 01:09:54,266
How can you know which one
is dead and which is not?

531
01:09:54,436 --> 01:09:57,006
No, you can't.
Impossible!

532
01:10:02,277 --> 01:10:04,962
It's a beautiful mystery, isn't it?

533
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:34,027
Lucas Bennett, can you come with me?

534
01:10:42,209 --> 01:10:43,907
Sit here.

535
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,338
Your name is Lucas Bennett, is that right?

536
01:11:04,616 --> 01:11:07,397
- Yeah.
- And your mother's name is Maria Bennett?

537
01:11:07,514 --> 01:11:09,786
Is that correct?

538
01:11:10,511 --> 01:11:15,594
We got you to look at those things,
please, and see if you recognize any of them?

539
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:18,360
Have a good look!

540
01:11:21,301 --> 01:11:23,363
Take your time.

541
01:11:39,483 --> 01:11:43,875
- Does anything look familiar?
- I don't know.

542
01:11:44,478 --> 01:11:46,943
You don't know?

543
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:53,997
Aye!

544
01:11:55,268 --> 01:11:58,672
- You recognize anything?
- I don't think so.

545
01:11:58,863 --> 01:12:01,270
You don't think so?

546
01:12:04,758 --> 01:12:06,283
Lucas?

547
01:12:10,124 --> 01:12:12,195
Could you please come with us?

548
01:12:28,835 --> 01:12:30,427
Mom.

549
01:12:37,066 --> 01:12:40,797
- Where have you been you?
- Where the hell have I been?

550
01:12:42,022 --> 01:12:46,721
Where the hell were you?
You promised me you weren't going anywhere.

551
01:12:52,062 --> 01:12:53,386
I thought you were dead, Mom.

552
01:12:56,559 --> 01:13:00,635
- Sorry.
- I thought you were dead.

553
01:13:08,376 --> 01:13:10,342
We're so sorry.

554
01:13:13,541 --> 01:13:16,476
Someone must have changed
her record during surgery.

555
01:13:17,077 --> 01:13:18,526
How is she?

556
01:13:20,935 --> 01:13:27,121
She had surgery on her
chest, but she lost a lot of blood.

557
01:13:27,428 --> 01:13:30,689
She was too weak
to have her leg operated on.

558
01:13:31,075 --> 01:13:34,239
She has to go back to
surgery when she recovers.

559
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:37,436
But she'll be okay, right?

560
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,157
Nothing. What next?

561
01:14:49,347 --> 01:14:50,728
Consider...

562
01:14:50,997 --> 01:14:54,171
We should try to get a ride
to Kathu Apal Hospital.

563
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:19,988
- Where are my kids?
- They took them away.

564
01:15:20,567 --> 01:15:22,581
- They didn't let me go with them. I'm Sorry.
- Where?

565
01:15:22,666 --> 01:15:24,075
I don't know.

566
01:15:44,135 --> 01:15:47,520
- I need to pee.
- You have to wait, Simon.

567
01:17:21,171 --> 01:17:23,913
Mom... Mom. Wake up.

568
01:17:24,848 --> 01:17:27,399
Mom, guess who I just saw outside.

569
01:17:27,944 --> 01:17:30,974
My leg. How is my leg?

570
01:17:44,579 --> 01:17:46,401
Still red.

571
01:18:07,036 --> 01:18:11,112
Please, my mom.
Her wound's looking real bad.

572
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:15,123
We're doing the best we can.

573
01:18:15,598 --> 01:18:19,242
We are taking your mom to
surgery right away.

574
01:18:38,555 --> 01:18:41,528
No, no, five minutes.
Give me five minutes, please. Please!

575
01:18:42,672 --> 01:18:43,486
OK!

576
01:18:43,522 --> 01:18:45,738
I don't want you to slow down.

577
01:18:46,767 --> 01:18:50,987
These are the names of my little girl Ginna
and Kathie, my wife. She's an American.

578
01:18:51,363 --> 01:18:53,233
- Would you check the list for me?
- Of course.

579
01:18:53,362 --> 01:18:59,404
Please, they told us her daughter could be in Surat Thani.
We already been to this hospital.

580
01:18:59,657 --> 01:19:03,780
We have checked all
hospitals. But this one, please.

581
01:19:04,001 --> 01:19:06,254
Five minutes, please!
Just only five minutes!

582
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:07,212
OK!

583
01:19:07,248 --> 01:19:10,403
I won't be long. I'll be right back.

584
01:19:25,730 --> 01:19:29,854
Lucas... Lucas...

585
01:19:32,124 --> 01:19:35,097
Is there anything left in the can?

586
01:19:40,815 --> 01:19:44,594
Alright, I'll get you something.

587
01:22:01,079 --> 01:22:02,422
Dad?

588
01:22:04,078 --> 01:22:05,420
Dad!

589
01:22:07,274 --> 01:22:08,712
Dad!

590
01:22:10,371 --> 01:22:11,521
Dad!

591
01:22:17,164 --> 01:22:18,363
Dad!

592
01:22:48,264 --> 01:22:50,345
- I need to pee.
- Can you hold it?

593
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:52,920
No.

594
01:22:55,426 --> 01:22:57,661
Simon, what are you doing?

595
01:23:06,418 --> 01:23:09,698
Hurry up, they're going to leave us here.
What are you doing?

596
01:23:33,738 --> 01:23:37,527
- No luck.
- Sorry.

597
01:23:41,252 --> 01:23:44,139
Sorry, and thanks for waiting.

598
01:23:45,218 --> 01:23:46,800
Thanks! We go now.

599
01:24:29,336 --> 01:24:31,628
Dad!

600
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:34,301
It's Lucas!

601
01:24:34,830 --> 01:24:42,830
- Lucas! Lucas!
- Lucas! Lucas!

602
01:24:44,771 --> 01:24:46,852
- Lucas!
- Lucas!

603
01:24:46,949 --> 01:24:51,869
- Simon! Thomas!
- Lucas! Lucas!

604
01:25:28,977 --> 01:25:30,550
Are you okay?

605
01:25:41,197 --> 01:25:42,386
Lucas!

606
01:25:44,861 --> 01:25:46,492
- Dad!
- Lucas!

607
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:48,871
Dad!
Dad!

608
01:25:50,358 --> 01:25:51,605
Lucas!

609
01:25:54,313 --> 01:25:56,461
- Dad!
- Lucas!

610
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,039
- Dad!
- Lucas!

611
01:26:00,048 --> 01:26:03,117
Dad! Dad!

612
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:20,910
Let's go, no need to wait.

613
01:26:36,212 --> 01:26:38,073
- Mom is here.
- What?

614
01:26:39,209 --> 01:26:42,854
She's very weak.
She said some weird stuff sometimes.

615
01:26:43,305 --> 01:26:46,086
The nurse is going to try operate
on her as soon as they can.

616
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:54,440
Mom, look who's here.

617
01:27:02,337 --> 01:27:06,825
Hey! Hey, my darling!

618
01:27:15,775 --> 01:27:16,926
Mom.

619
01:27:19,869 --> 01:27:22,986
- Is everyone okay?
- We are all okay.

620
01:27:31,359 --> 01:27:35,301
- I'm gonna die.
- No, no.

621
01:27:41,448 --> 01:27:43,223
Is it okay to take this off?

622
01:27:44,246 --> 01:27:46,451
It is in my cost.

623
01:27:59,331 --> 01:28:05,680
- You came back?
- Yes.

624
01:28:09,322 --> 01:28:11,460
I can rest now.

625
01:28:17,913 --> 01:28:22,689
Maria, what?
What, what darling?

626
01:28:23,408 --> 01:28:26,765
- I'm dying.
- No. No.

627
01:28:27,705 --> 01:28:32,787
- You're going to be fine.
- Take care of my babies.

628
01:28:32,998 --> 01:28:35,971
Hey, that's not why I came here for.

629
01:28:36,995 --> 01:28:39,594
You're gonna be fine as
they're going to take good care of you, OK?

630
01:28:39,743 --> 01:28:42,256
I promise you we are going to be fine.

631
01:28:42,989 --> 01:28:47,161
- Henry. I'm scared.
- We're gonna be fine.

632
01:28:47,884 --> 01:28:49,130
Henry!

633
01:28:49,482 --> 01:28:51,486
I promise we're going to be okay.

634
01:28:52,751 --> 01:28:56,434
We're taking her for surgery.
We need to take her now.

635
01:28:56,976 --> 01:28:58,328
Okay.

636
01:29:03,069 --> 01:29:06,704
I love you.
You're gonna be okay.

637
01:29:07,625 --> 01:29:11,193
I love you so much.
I love you.

638
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:14,986
You have to go now.

639
01:29:15,658 --> 01:29:17,816
You know I love you.

640
01:29:18,354 --> 01:29:21,059
I'm sorry, I have to leave your hand...

641
01:30:09,905 --> 01:30:11,439
Lucas,

642
01:30:12,501 --> 01:30:14,649
thanks for taking care of mom.

643
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:18,538
We took care of each other.

644
01:30:19,096 --> 01:30:20,726
Yeah.

645
01:30:25,190 --> 01:30:28,758
- Dad?
- Yeah.

646
01:30:28,987 --> 01:30:31,184
There is something I didn't tell Mom,

647
01:30:31,534 --> 01:30:34,986
and I really need her to know.

648
01:31:01,055 --> 01:31:03,126
I have a family too.

649
01:31:06,850 --> 01:31:09,612
I've been saving my strength...

650
01:31:10,007 --> 01:31:14,572
Because I want to see them...
one more time.

651
01:32:05,990 --> 01:32:07,640
<i>No, no.</i>

652
01:32:08,089 --> 01:32:09,959
Oh, do you have to?

653
01:32:10,987 --> 01:32:15,687
- We don't want you to feel any pain.
- I'm afraid to be asleep.

654
01:32:16,373 --> 01:32:18,252
You're in good hands.

655
01:32:19,779 --> 01:32:22,464
Close your eyes and
think of something nice.

656
01:32:24,874 --> 01:32:27,051
Think of something nice.

657
01:35:53,870 --> 01:35:56,412
Mom is okay, Lucas.

658
01:35:58,506 --> 01:36:00,069
We're going home.

659
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:18,529
Mr. Bennett, I'm one of the customer holds
for the travel insurance.

660
01:36:18,645 --> 01:36:21,725
We have sent to take care of your family.
There is nothing to worry about now.

661
01:36:22,444 --> 01:36:24,456
In a few hours, we will be
at Singapore General Hospital.

662
01:36:24,541 --> 01:36:27,582
Where your wife will receive
the best treatment in your living.

663
01:36:28,236 --> 01:36:31,583
These people will take you into a plane.
I'll see you over there.

664
01:36:31,764 --> 01:36:33,413
Have a safe flight.

665
01:37:16,690 --> 01:37:18,454
Where are we going?

666
01:37:20,086 --> 01:37:24,757
They take us to Singapore.
We'll be safe there, OK?

667
01:37:28,579 --> 01:37:31,840
Oh, please take your seat!
We will be taking off shortly.

668
01:37:32,076 --> 01:37:33,073
Okay.

669
01:37:53,553 --> 01:37:56,334
- Can I just...
- Yeah, okay. One minute.

670
01:38:11,337 --> 01:38:13,198
How are you?

671
01:38:14,935 --> 01:38:17,390
Here, with you.

672
01:38:22,028 --> 01:38:26,679
Mom, guess what?

673
01:38:29,321 --> 01:38:31,412
I saw Daniel again...

674
01:38:34,116 --> 01:38:36,006
He was so happy.

675
01:38:39,510 --> 01:38:41,323
He was in somebody's arms.

676
01:38:44,504 --> 01:38:46,125
I bet it was his dad, Mom.

677
01:38:54,295 --> 01:38:56,491
I'm so proud of you.

678
01:39:01,409 --> 01:39:04,277
I love you so much.

679
01:39:12,469 --> 01:39:15,547
Thank you. Thank you.

680
01:39:17,474 --> 01:39:20,322
I feel sorry, but you have to
have back your seat now.

681
01:39:29,661 --> 01:39:32,135
Fasten seat belts, please.

682
01:39:33,257 --> 01:39:39,136
- I don't want to.
- No? You have to fasten your seatbelt in the plane.

683
01:40:14,917 --> 01:40:18,303
<i>We are at the beach.</i>

684
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,513
It's all right.
