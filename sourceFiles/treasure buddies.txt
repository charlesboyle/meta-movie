1
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,928
[indistinct chattering]

2
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,395
[monkey chittering]

3
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,610
This will add nicely to Babi's treasure.

4
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,863
[straining] Ah!

5
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:15,908
[chittering]

6
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,161
[laughing]

7
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,294
- As-salaam alaikum, Uncle Babi.
- Nephew Babu.

8
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,838
My new apprentice, you have arrived.

9
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:33,092
Welcome to Uncle Babi's humble palace.

10
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,011
Babu is most excited
to learn art of adventure.

11
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:40,474
Good to hear. Babi is most excited
to teach art of adventure.

12
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,309
Babi always wanted a sidekick.

13
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,812
[squeaking]

14
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,940
Wow! Uncle Babi,
look at all your treasures.

15
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,109
Babi like shiny objects.

16
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,365
I want to be great adventurer

17
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,659
and treasure hunterjust like you.

18
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,161
No more organ grinder
school for Babu.

19
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,413
I will teach you everything I know.

20
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:07,042
What is the greatest treasure
you ever found, Uncle Babi?

21
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,418
Ohh!

22
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:12,714
That is a very special story
that Babi has not told anyone.

23
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:16,885
Tell Babu! Tell Babu, please!

24
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,472
OK. It all happened
when Babi met the Buddies.

25
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,974
You know the Buddies?!

26
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,393
Uncle Babi not only friends
with the Buddies,

27
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,271
but Babi once saved their lives.

28
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,857
Is this another one
of your tall tales, Uncle Babi?

29
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,859
My mom says you
exaggerate sometimes.

30
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:35,904
No, cheeky monkey.
This is truest of true story.

31
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,657
It all started 40 years ago,

32
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,535
when a brave adventurer
named Thomas Howard

33
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:45,205
came to Egypt with his best
friend and partner, Digger,

34
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,082
looking for the Bronze of Bastet.

35
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,960
We've done it, Digger.
Good boy.

36
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:53,088
[Babu] What is a Bronze of Bastet,
Uncle Babi?

37
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,008
[Babi] It is the first clue
leading to a great treasure:

38
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,927
the lost collar of Cleocatra.

39
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,512
[rumbling]

40
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,899
The other half is missing.

41
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,109
- [rocks rumbling]
- [barks]

42
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,654
The chest was booby-trapped.

43
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,325
Run, boy! Run, boy, run!

44
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,457
[panting]

45
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,629
[Digger barking]

46
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,382
Leave it, Digger.
It's too dangerous. Let's go!

47
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,061
Ah! [grunts]

48
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,611
Good boy.

49
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,905
Phew!
That was close call.

50
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,449
Babu happy Digger escaped from tomb.

51
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,869
So did they ever find the other half?
And where are the Buddies?

52
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:11,416
Be patient, Babu.
Great adventurer has much patience.

53
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,503
Now hurry up and listen,
so Uncle Babi can continue story.

54
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,464
Many years went by
and Thomas retired.

55
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,092
He moved to a small town
called Fernfield,

56
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,551
where he opened a museum,

57
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,346
had a family and
a grandson named Pete.

58
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,432
And so Digger and I made it out

59
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,435
just as the tomb collapsed.

60
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,523
[Babi] And Digger had grandpuppies, too,
who were heroic, just like him.

61
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,818
The Buddies:
Buddha, Budderball, Mudbud,

62
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,195
B-Dawg and their little sis, Rosebud.

63
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,281
But don't let
the pink bow fool you,

64
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,908
she is feistier
than all the boys combined.

65
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:49,913
And we brought this half of the
Bronze of Bastet back to Fernfield.

66
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,082
This way, please.

67
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,835
OK, let's move to the next room.

68
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,753
[quiet, indistinct chattering]

69
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,214
Whoa, Digger was the coolest dude ever.

70
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,968
Perhaps Digger's spirit lives in you.
You both love dirt.

71
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,387
Yo, Digger was old-school cool.

72
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,724
- I'm the new fly dog.
- I met your great grandpappy

73
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,143
when I was knee-high to a grasshopper.

74
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,813
I heard grasshoppers and bugs
are a delicacy in some countries.

75
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,692
Can you imagine ever being so
hungry you have to eat bugs?

76
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,527
Yeah, right, Budderball.

77
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,363
You'd eat anything...
other than vegetables.

78
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:27,367
As the legend goes,
Cleopatra was given a necklace,

79
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:31,413
which contained the powerful
jewel of the Cat's Eye.

80
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,416
But, somehow, it became lost.

81
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,586
But you almost found it,
didn't you, Grandpa?

82
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,130
I certainly tried, Peter.

83
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:46,094
Well... that wraps up my last tour.

84
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,848
Thank you.
Thank you all for being here.

85
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,558
Have a wonderful day.

86
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,186
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

87
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,521
Wow, Grandpa, that was great.

88
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,566
Ah, if you like it, Peter,
that's enough for me.

89
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:03,153
Why does the museum have to close?
Such a bummer.

90
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,323
Yes, Pete, it is a... bummer.

91
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,991
And we haven't had the funding

92
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,786
to acquire a new exhibit
in quite some time.

93
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,125
It's really too bad you and Digger
never found the other half,

94
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,628
and the lost necklace of Cleocatra.

95
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,090
I just hope a young archeologist
like you finds it,

96
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,634
and not some greedy grave robber.

97
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,263
How did dogs become man's
best friends if cats were first?

98
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:34,810
The Cat's Eye necklace was
believed to have magical powers.

99
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:38,939
Legend has it Cleocatra
had plotted to steal it.

100
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,817
They say she wanted
to change the order,

101
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:47,280
making cats rulers over all
Earth's creatures, including man.

102
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:52,244
But, somehow, she was foiled
by the legendary pup, Buddasi.

103
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,831
Cleocatra's necklace
was never seen again.

104
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,625
All we know is the order was changed

105
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:03,130
and dogs became man's best friend,
and cats were banished.

106
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,258
I guess that's why it's in
our DNA to chase cats, dudes.

107
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,593
When I see one,
I just can't help it.

108
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,932
[moans] Did you see that?
The cat's eyes moved.

109
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,060
Huh. Must be one of those
optical delusions.

110
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,729
Oh, don't worry, B-Dawg. [chuckles]

111
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,274
Those cats are just statues.

112
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,657
[sniffing]

113
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,493
Come on, cat, I'm gettin'
all up in your grill.

114
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,954
What are you gonna do about it?

115
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,706
Yeah, that's what I thought.

116
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,418
You ain't nothing but
a skinny, bald, scaredy-cat.

117
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,588
- [hissing]
- [gasps] Ahh!

118
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,718
Now, just wait a minute, Peter.

119
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,850
Here's some stuff you might like.
Tools of the trade.

120
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:01,938
- Anything you want is yours.
- Even your compass?

121
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,982
Better a young explorer
like you have it.

122
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,612
[chuckles] Oh. And here's
something for Mudbud.

123
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,366
- It's Digger's favorite bandanna.
- Cool!

124
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,912
[groans] Yes.

125
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,788
[cooing]

126
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:25,545
He's the spitting image
of his great grandpappy.

127
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,592
Wait. Why was Grandpa Thomas
giving away all his things?

128
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,469
Was he giving up being adventurer?

129
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,306
Yes, but Grandpa Thomas
about to learn important lesson.

130
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,142
Great adventurer never gives up.

131
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,522
What are we going to do with this now?

132
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,775
Well, I'm not sure what
we should do with it, Peter.

133
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,361
- [man clears throat]
- Oh, my, I apologize.

134
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,863
I didn't see you there,
Mister...?

135
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,282
Wellington.
Dr. Philip Wellington.

136
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,161
Of course.
Dr. Wellington, what an honor.

137
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,289
May I... as you say in America,

138
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,333
cut right to the chase, professor?

139
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:10,340
I have something that
I think might... interest you.

140
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,765
- It can't be. May I?
- Hmm.

141
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,395
[soft, eerie echoing]

142
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,690
Unbelievable.
How did you find this?

143
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,859
Well, let's just say
it took a very long time

144
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,320
and... considerable effort.

145
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,241
Why didn't I hear of this discovery?

146
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:41,663
Well, the Egyptian government and I
thought it best to keep it on the QT

147
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,457
- until we discover...
- Cleocatra's tomb!

148
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,711
Precisely. I have a plane
waiting on standby.

149
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,880
Well, I can'tjust
pick up and go to Egypt.

150
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:56,052
Thomas, the only missing piece
of the puzzle is you.

151
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,890
But I promised my grandson
a camping trip for spring break.

152
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,476
Well, bring the lad along.

153
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:07,230
Surely, a trip to Egypt
is more exciting.

154
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:11,610
Yeah!
Mudbud can come too, right?

155
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,696
[stammers] That?
No, no, no. No dogs.

156
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,905
- Yes...
- [playful growling]

157
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:20,243
I'm afraid my dear, sweet cat,
Ubasti, is allergic to them,

158
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,663
so your Mud dog
will have to stay here.

159
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,374
So what do you say, Thomas?
Do we have an arrangement?

160
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,168
[stammering]

161
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,837
- I don't know.
- Oh, my dear man.

162
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,174
You don't want to be an old relic,
like the things in this quaint,

163
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,760
little museum,
when you could show the world

164
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,305
what a great archeologist
Thomas Howard really is.

165
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,725
Finding Cleocatra's necklace

166
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:47,979
is one of the greatest
archeological finds in history.

167
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,065
You've worked for this your whole life.

168
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,567
And you know well
that opportunities like this

169
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,487
only come round once in a lifetime.

170
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,869
You're right.
Let's find that tomb!

171
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:06,915
The town of Bastati,
that is where we must go.

172
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,795
- You ready to go, Peter?
- Oh, I'm ready.

173
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,005
This is gonna be epic!

174
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,800
Take care of my baby, Dad.
Remember he's only ten.

175
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,927
- [Mudbud barking]
- And call me when you land.

176
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,762
And then every day, twice.

177
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,099
- Don't you worry, sweetheart.
- Well, we mustn't dawdle.

178
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,393
Wheels up in precisely 26 minutes.

179
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,395
Chop-chop. Let's go.

180
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,942
- [whimpering]
- Hey, Mudbud. Bye...

181
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,278
Ohh. Yes.

182
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,197
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, sweetie.

183
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,283
- Bye, Dad.
- Be good.

184
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,287
- Have a good time.
- Let's go, Peter.

185
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,376
I'll bring you back some Egyptian mud.

186
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,961
He won't be bringing you back

187
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,797
- anything, Dirtbud.
- Huh?

188
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,842
When we find the Cat's Eye jewel,
it'll be mine,

189
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:02,804
and cats will finally rule,
with me as their queen.

190
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,140
Not if the Buddies
have anything to say about it.

191
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:09,310
Bye-bye, fleabag. [cackling]

192
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:13,773
- [growling, barking]
- Ohh. Poor Mudbud's devastated.

193
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,025
[Mudbud continues barking]

194
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,652
Ohh.

195
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,000
That cat dudette
cannot get away with this.

196
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,335
Don't worry, Pete,
I'm coming to save you.

197
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,880
[howls]

198
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:57,192
- [indistinct chattering]
- We heard your emergency howl.

199
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,361
Is everything OK? Or was someone
just trying to give you a bath?

200
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,655
Pete and Grandpa Thomas
are in trouble!

201
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,699
You know that collar
Sniffer told us about?

202
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,910
The one that could be
the end of all dogkind?

203
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,537
- Yeah?
- Well, that creepy cat said

204
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:13,041
she was going to get the collar
and use it to rule humans and dogs.

205
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,710
Yo, ain't no one
gonna rule the B-Dawg.

206
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,421
Nohow, no way.
That's fo' shizzle.

207
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,174
What are we waiting for?
Let's get on that plane.

208
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,512
- Follow me.
- Team Buddies to the rescue.

209
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,348
- [chattering continues]
- [Buddies panting]

210
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,517

[hammering]

212
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,200
[man] Back it up a little bit.

213
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,662
- Yo, what's the plan now?
- We hitch a ride to Egypt

214
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,581
and kick some serious kitty butt, dudes.

215
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,046
So Buddies set off for Egypt,

216
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,716
a land of amazing adventure
and shiny treasure,

217
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:07,178
but most importantly, me,
Babi the Great.

218
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,120
[man] As-salaam alaikum, Mr. Wellington.
Very happy to see you.

219
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,956
Seti, skip the formalities
and unload the plane.

220
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,125
Meet us in Bastati
and gather supplies.

221
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,461
[both speaking foreign language]

222
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,298
That means "good morning."

223
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:47,093
I'm Thomas Howard,
and this is my grandson, Peter.

224
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,972
Hello. Hello, Peter.
My name is Seti.

225
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,141
This is my cousin, Tarik.

226
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,900
[both grunting]

227
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,695
What, you crazy?
This is explosives.

228
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,406
Put that down.
What is wrong with you?

229
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:09,991
Mmm.

230
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,042
Hey, you guys,
we must've landed in Egypt.

231
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,085
It's raining falafel sauce!

232
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,141
[indistinct chattering]

233
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,356
[boy speaks foreign language]

234
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,490
[woman shouting]

235
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,665
[both speak foreign language]

236
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,166
Come on, Peter.

237
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,212
Wow!

238
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,966
Egypt... I've missed this place.

239
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,802
- Come on.
- You think we can explore the bazaar?

240
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,888
[Seti chattering indistinctly]

241
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,351
Dudes, I think
we're on the road again.

242
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,520
When do you meet the Buddies,
Uncle Babi?

243
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,772
Soon, soon. Be patient.

244
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,362
At first, Babi met
Pete and Grandpa Thomas.

245
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,328
[chittering]

246
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,168
- This place is so cool.
- [chuckles]

247
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,421
Mudbud would've loved this.

248
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,464
Let me show you something, Peter.

249
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,258
[speaks foreign language]

250
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:58,099
- [Peter] What are they?
- Dried seeds. Great for snacking.

251
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,281
[Babi] Pete give Babi
his favorite compass in trade.

252
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,747
[Babu] Uncle Babi, what did you
trade Pete for compass?

253
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:25,376
[Babi] Did Babi say "trade"?
I mean borrow... permanently.

254
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,715
- [meows]
- No, no, Ubasti, come back.

255
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,134
No, no, no. Don't go
into that awful market.

256
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,721
OK, let's go.
Slightly used camel,

257
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,599
low mileage,
owned by little old lady.

258
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,976
Do I hear 500 pounds?

259
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:46,731
Five hundred? Sold! OK.
Let's have the money. OK.

260
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:51,611
And now, Babu, Babi about to
meet bad man and hairless cat.

261
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,700
- Kitty?
- [man speaks foreign language]

262
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,161

263

- How very nice of you.
- [man continues in foreign language]

264
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,707
What is this?

265
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,462
- [man] Pure Egyptian...
- [gasps]

266
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,924
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

267
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,803
There's nothing I detest more
than a petty, primate thief.

268
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,349
[squeaks] Babi not steal.
I was just admiring shiny object.

269
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,268
Beat it! [hisses]

270
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,189

- Ubasti, there you are.

[both singing in foreign language]

273
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,532
Ooh.

274
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:43,621
Guys, I think this is cheese!
I'm starving.

275
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,082
Yuck, that cheese smells funny.

276
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,708
This is stinky cheese.

277
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,429
I guess stinky cheese
is an acquired taste.

278
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,223
I'd better acquire some more.

279
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:12,483
- As-salaam alaikum.

Oh. Oh!

282

You don't speak English.

283

[uncomfortably speaking
foreign language]

285
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,209
You said that I am a cucumber.

- Hey, you do speak English.
- Yes, my father taught me.

287

My name is Farah.
You are American.

Yeah. I'm here with my Grandpa.
He's a great archeologist.

289
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,061
We're going to discover
Cleocatra's tomb.

290
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,230
Cleopatra's tomb.

291
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,983
No, not Cleopatra.

It was very nice to meet you, Peter.
As-salaam alaikum.

[groaning]
Guys, I'm not feeling too good.

297

Budderball, don't panic, but...

298
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:32,021
I don't think that was cheese
you ate. It was explosives!

299
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,982
Oh, no. I'm gonna explode!

300

306
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,832
Hey... get the crowbar.
I'll get this one.

It's Dirtbud and his team
of dim-witted wonder dogs.

317
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,111
How did they get here?

318

OK, we've got a lot of ground
to cover. Let's split into groups.

B-Dawg, you go with Buddha,
so we can keep you out of trouble.

Budderball, you stick with
Mudbud, and I'll go by myself.

I know how you boys
hate shopping anyways.

326

Aww...

342
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,160
Oh, sweet mama, kebabs!

343
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,412
We're on a mission here, Budderball.

344
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,956
But I search much better
on a full stomach.

345
00:22:56,124 --> 00:23:00,461
Besides, the best way to know a new
culture is to sample its cuisine.

346
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,547
[whining]

347
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,136
OK, one kebab for you. Eat it.

348
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:13,015
- [Babi laughs]
- Hey, come back here!

349
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,934
Stop that thief!

350
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,685
Yo, dawg, did you hear that?

351
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,396
It sounds like Budderball's in trouble.

352
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,815
It came from over there.
Come on, B-Dawg.

353
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,733
[Babu] Uncle Babi, wait a second.

354
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,404
That's how you met the Buddies?
You stole Budderball's kebab?

355
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:31,409
You snooze, you lose. And Babi,
winner-winner kebab dinner.

356
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,744
Anyways, Babi helping Budderball out.

357
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,996
Chicken bone choking hazard for dogs.

358
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,124
Stop! [panting]

359
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,501
Somebody stop that kebab-a-robber!

360
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,461
[groans] Boys.

361
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,137
[soft chittering]

362
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,639
Got you cornered, you chicken thief.

363
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,267
Budderball, stop monkeying around.

364
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,645
I'm not monkeying around,
he's monkeying around.

365
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,566
Please, don't hurt Babi.
Babi am but a humble monkey.

366
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,444
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

367
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,572
- This monkey is a no-good crook.
- Here.

368
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,158
[laughs]

369
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,120
See, now I give you something in trade.

370
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,623
- I'm not much of a hat dog.
- Ooh. Looks good on you.

371
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:24,462
- OK, we'll call it even-steven.
- I am Babi, not Steven.

372
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:28,257
I'm Budderball and these
are my brothers, Mudbud, Buddha,

373
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,051
and B-Dawg, and our little sis, Rosebud.

374
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,262
It is pleasure to meet you all.

375
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:37,183
- What brings you to Egypt?
- Actually, we're looking for my people.

376
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,018
My boy, Peter, and his grandpa.

377
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,646
They were last seen with a bad man
and a creepy cat with no fur.

378
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:47,276
Oh! I think I saw that cat today.
Babi does not like cats.

379
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,527
You've seen her?

380
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,114
Hey, that's Pete's compass, dude!

381
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:55,075
Babi see it fall
out of boy's pocket.

382
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,328
Finders keeper, losers weeper.

383
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,121
So you've seen Pete, too?

384
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,457
That compass is
very important to him.

385
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,252
Babi could give you compass...
perhaps in trade?

386
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,631
Babi likes shiny objects.

387
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,800
My bling?
You've gots to be trippin'.

388
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:15,054
Babi will give you compass
and help you with everything.

389
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,722
Promise to get you to boy.

390
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,726
"B" for Babi look very nice
on Babi's hairy chest.

391
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,103
Sorry, dawg, you can't have it.

392
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,940
B-Dawg, he knows where
Pete and Grandpa Thomas are.

393
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,734
We need his help.
Give him anything he wants.

394
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,861
[man initiating
Muslim call to prayer]

395
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,659
- What's that, dudes?
- It's the Muslim call to prayer.

396
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:40,120
It is getting late.
Market not safe at night.

397
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,874
Babi know place where you can sleep.
I will show you boy in the morning.

398
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,335
Follow me, friends.

399
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,629
This is so not happening.

400
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,131
I'm practically naked without my bling.

401
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,634
[chittering]

402
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,349
This way, Buddies.

403
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,187
[whistling]

404
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,149
Yo, what's that, dawg?

405
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:13,904
It appears to be a sarcophagus, B-Dawg.
Where they put mummies in ancient Egypt.

406
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,240
[stammers] Mummies?!

407
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:20,411
- Relax, they don't really come to life.
- I knew that, dawg.

408
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,788
[continues whistling]

409
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,374
Quick, hide. Someone is coming.

410
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:32,506
[grunting]

411
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:38,512
OK... OK, now tomorrow you must sell,

412
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,808
or... [slicing sound]
OK? OK. Bye-bye.

413
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:50,691
- [door closes]
- [whimpering]

414
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,866
Hey, what's wrong, little camel?

415
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,785
That mean human
stole me from my mother,

416
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,787
and he's trying to sell me.

417
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,874
You were taken from your mother?
That's awful.

418
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:11,337
I must find her. My tribe
is on their way into the desert.

419
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:15,466
If I don't catch up with them soon,
I might never see her again.

420
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,135
- Tribe?
- It is my family.

421
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:21,555
I belong with the Bedouin tribe.
We are travelers.

422
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:25,684
I get it. Kinda like my posse.
The name's B-Dawg.

423
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:29,146
- My name is Cammy.
- I'm Rosebud and these are my brothers.

424
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,439
Maybe we can help.

425
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:33,776
- [lid creaking]
- Mummy! Ahh!

426
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,778
[laughing]

427
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:38,280
- Babi!
- Is coast clear?

428
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,449
Babi, this is Cammy.

429
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,995
As-salaam alaikum, little camel.

430
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,877
Dudes, I hate to be a bummer,
but the door is locked.

431
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,212
We're stuck in here.

432
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,464
Babi going to solve
everyone's troubles.

433
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:59,259
You all sleep now.
Babi will go see what he can find out.

434
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,689
[snoring]

435
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,944
[Thomas] "It will lead you
to the water's path."

436
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,779
[Wellington]
Perhaps someone misinformed you.

437
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,948
We're in the desert, there's no water.

438
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,283
- We're here.
- [Thomas] Ah!

439
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:28,080
"From the eye of the needle,
take direction from Thoth."

440
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,332
What do you think it means, Grandpa?

441
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,918
Thoth, the moon god,
take direction from the moon.

442
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:36,088
- The moon.
- "From the eye of the needle,

443
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:39,800
take direction from the moon.

444
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:44,012
On the 12th day,
the moon will light the way."

445
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,307
- There's a full moon tonight.
- That looks like a needle,

446
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:50,310
and there's a half-moon
carved in the top.

447
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,982
The obelisk! Peter, let's go!

448
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,738
Ahh.

449
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,160
[panting]

450
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:12,124
- Oh, my. Dr. Wellington.
- Yes, yes, of course.

451
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,586
[pieces clanking]

452
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,469

[gears clanking]

454
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,649
Incredible.

455
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,041
- What now?
- Well, now...

456
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,919
...we need to calibrate
the position of the beam

457
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,004
and coordinate it on the map.

458
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,928
Ah, given the height
of the tower...

459
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,764
...60 feet,

460
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:14,353
the light should be going
south by southeast, 86 miles.

461
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:18,440
And leading us... to this oasis.

462
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:22,820
Ah! They're heading to the oasis.
I must tell the Buddies.

463
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,869
[man snoring]

464
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,081

00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,674
[man shouts]

468
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,138
[grunting]

469
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,063
- Buddies!
- What's up?

470
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,940
Your people are leaving in the morning.

471
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,943
They're on their way to oasis,
deep in desert.

472
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:06,071
Oasis? I've been there
with my tribe before.

473
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,365
That could be where they're headed, too.

474
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,908
I can show you the way.

475
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,869
And we can help you find your tribe.

476
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,204
Babi will hitch ride and slow them down.

477
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,968
Ohh.

478
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:31,263
- What are you thinking?
- How rad this is.

479
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,725
- Mudbud would've loved it.
- [chuckles heartily]

480
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:38,812
Knowing Mudbud, he's probably
off on an adventure of his own.

481
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,025
You know, for some reason,
Mudbud doesn't feel that far away.

482
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,663
[indistinct chattering]

483
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,546
Ahh! Bad man's truck.

486
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,556
Got it.

487
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,852
Upsy-daisy.

488
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,271
[laughs]

489
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,693
Chop-chop, my good man.
We're seven minutes behind schedule.

[man whistling]

491
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:34,618
I know that whistle.
The man is coming to take me away.

492
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,662
Not ifwe have anything to do with it.

493
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,414
I've an idea, Cammy.
You up for it?

494
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:42,042
Anything to get back to my mom.

495
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,672

Oh! [groans]

00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,069
My beautiful camel! Oh!

500
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,157
[woman] Oh!

501
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:20,080
[Babi] Now, the Buddies and
their newfound camel friend escape,

502
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,957
and follow Babi into the desert.

503
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,417
[Babu] Where were you, Uncle Babi?

504
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,169

- [shouts in foreign language]
- Who are they, Grandpa?

507
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,135
They're Bedouins, Pete.

508
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:36,013
They're a nomadic people of the desert.

509
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,396
[Seti speaks foreign language]

510
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:49,109
Hey, you, move your disgusting
beasts. I'm in a hurry.

511
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,986
You should be very careful.

512
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,780
This area is known
for bandits and thieves.

513
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,825
- [shouting indistinctly]
- Safe travels.

514
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,131
[laughs, chitters]

515
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,677
[Buddies panting]

516
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,685
Come on, guys. We just
have to make it to the oasis.

517
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:27,439
I'm running on fumes.
Cammy, aren't you hungry?

518
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,400
We camels were born
to survive in the heat,

519
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,111
and go a long time
without food and water.

520
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:36,656
We can regurgitate the food
in our stomach and re-chew it,

521
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,950
so we can go longer
without a meal.

522
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:42,871
- Eww. TMI, Cammy.
- Good idea.

523
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,164
[retches]

524
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:52,089
- Budderball... gross.
- Mmm. I love leftovers.

525
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,344
[Tarik coughing]

526
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,141
What happened? What you do?

527
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:06,144
I told you, check out the truck
before we left.

528
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,396
- But I did.
- You did? Oh.

529
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,649
I swear, your brain
is the size of a monkey's.

530
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,026
- [blows raspberry]
- [truck door opens, closes]

531
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,569
[Wellington] For heaven's sakes,
what's wrong with it?

532
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,864
- Is broken.
- [laughing]

533
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,492
I don't suppose you know
anything about motorized vehicles?

534
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,577
Well, as a matter of fact, I do.

535
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:29,126
Well, let's see what the problem is.
Oh, my goodness.

536
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,088
Hose came loose. [laughs]

537
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,633
Just put some coolant in it.

538
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,388
[Buddies panting]

539
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,396
[Thomas] Look,
there's the oasis just up ahead.

540
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,150
[Peter] How did all this grow
in the middle of the desert?

541
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,652
[Thomas] Even though
we're in the driest of places,

542
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,323
centuries ago, in Cleopatra's time,
there was a river here.

543
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,451
And that river is still
running deep underground.

544
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,830
We'll set up camp,
look for the next clue at daybreak.

545
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,206
All right.

546
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,584
[Buddies panting]

547
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:16,882
- Are we close, Cammy?
- I... I am not sure, Rosebud.

548
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,758
I think so.

549
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:22,888
Aw, snap. We're doomed. Doomed!

550
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:26,725
- Think positively, B-Dawg.
- I am positive.

551
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:30,020
Positively sure we're lost
in the middle of the desert.

552
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,607
Do not worry, Buddies,
my tribe has been here.

553
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,443
There's some camel poop
on the ground right there.

554
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,740
[sniffing, groans]

555
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,575
That's camel poop all right.

556
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:46,870
We're gonna need a bulldozer
to clean up that mess,

557
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,040
'cause a pooper scooper
definitely's not doing it.

558
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,084
It's getting too dark
to follow their trail.

559
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,420
The dudette is correctomundo.

560
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,423
We'll rest here for the night,
and get our groove back tomorrow.

561
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:05,555
So, young Peter, what story
would you like to hear this time?

562
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,350
Can you tell me the story
about the Cat's Eye necklace?

563
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,684
All right.

564
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:13,647
The cat goddess, Bastet,
gave a special necklace

565
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:18,235
with a Cat's Eye jewel to Cleopatra,
the ruler of Egypt.

566
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,363
Cleopatra's favorite feline,
Cleocatra,

567
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:25,825
was furious that Bastet
gave the necklace to a human.

568
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,453
She decided to steal the necklace.

569
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:32,499
But a vigilant puppy, Buddasi,
saw Cleocatra.

570
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,963
- [gasps]
- [meows]

571
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,050
[Thomas] And Cleopatra was so mad

572
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,011
over being betrayed
by her trusted cat,

573
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:49,099
that she used the necklace
to make dogs man's best friend.

574
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,977
And cats were banished from the palace.

575
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,770
[thundering]

576
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,652
- [thundering]
- Grandpa, is it gonna rain?

577
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:05,615
No, no. That's just dry lightning
from an electrical storm.

578
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,201
Happens all the time
out here in the desert.

579
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,746
Ah, looks far enough away.

580
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:14,541
I'm sure we're perfectly safe.

581
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:20,046
Time to hit the rack, though.
We have an early day tomorrow.

582
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,299
You get a good sleep.

583
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,759
I'm gonna go stretch
these old legs of mine.

584
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:28,179
Grandpa, thank you for
bringing me on this adventure.

585
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:32,809
[chuckles]
It's my pleasure, Peter.

586
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,937
I couldn't ask for a better partner.

587
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,278
Mudbud, are you OK?

588
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,614
Yeah, I'm just sorry
I got us into this.

589
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,450
I'm really worried about Pete.

590
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:51,244
Fate set us on this path, Mudbud.

591
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,288
Every journey has a deeper reason.

592
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,750
Good night, Buddies,
you're the best of friends.

593
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,626
Sweet dreams, everybody.

594
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,683
Wake up, Buddies. It's morning.

595
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,770
Let's rock and roll. Who knows
how far ahead of us they are.

596
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,493
Hey, Grandpa,
I'm gonna go explore.

597
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:36,623
- Have you seen my compass?
- No. No, I haven't, Peter.

598
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,917
Well, you go ahead.
I'll join you in a minute.

599
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,586
[yawns]

600
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,549
- Ah!
- [gasps] You got me.

601
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,969
- Hello, Farah.
- Hello, Peter.

602
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,931
- When did you get here?
- Late last night.

603
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,850
Sometimes we travel at night
when it is cooler.

604
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,519
Where are you going?

605
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,188
Our tribe is making
its way through the desert.

606
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,148
It is our way, nothing more.

607
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,692
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to be nosy.

608
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,695
My daughter says you are here
with your grandfather.

609
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,448
- This man you are traveling with...
- [shouting]

610
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,617
...does your grandfather know him well?

611
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,411
He just met him a few days ago.

612
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,329
You would do well not to trust him.

613
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:21,418
Be safe. The desert can be
a very unforgiving place.

614
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,880
- [Peter] See you later, Farah.
- Bye.

615
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,465
[Thomas] Ah, Peter.

616
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,719
- I see you've made a friend.
- That man said not to trust...

617
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:35,098
All right, chaps,
no time for chattering.

618
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,977
- Time to find the next clue.
- [Thomas] Well...

619
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:45,442
- This well was built centuries ago.
- Mmm.

620
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,902
This was the widest
part of the river.

621
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:52,323
And the Egyptians would
have built an access

622
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,200
to the river running down below.

623
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,910
[grunting]

624
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:59,122
- Are you OK, Grandpa?
- Yes!

625
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,834
Ohh!

626
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:05,962
Jackpot!

627
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,507
What? What have you found?

628
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,843
- It's the Cat's Eye symbol.
- [chortling]

629
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,012
[Thomas laughing]
This must be the entrance.

630
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,139
[grunting]

631
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,105
[Thomas] Careful now. Careful.

632
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,902
Here we go.
All right. I got this.

633
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,821
- [men grunting]
- Easy does it.

634
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,573
Slow, slow.

635
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,451
Hold it.

636
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,203
Ooh!

637
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,087
Careful.

638
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,757
Whoa!

639
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,717
Uh-huh...

640
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:56,721
[Thomas] Look how much
light is coming in here. Ah!

641
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,934
The sun must be directly
over the opening of the well.

642
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:05,563
- Oh.
- [soft, eerie echoing]

643
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,081
Oh. Peter.

644
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,584
Go clean off that part
of the wall over there.

645
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:30,004
And, Seti, clean that other spot.

646
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,301
[Wellington]
Hurry along, hurry along.

647
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,477
Well, what does it mean?

648
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:48,898
That one stands for royalty
in this part of Egypt.

649
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,484
And the other is called a menet.

650
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:55,071
It's the source
of great power for the gods.

651
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,197
Tarik, the map!

652
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,740
[muttering]

653
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,661
Thank you.

654
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,414
- [Wellington] Yes, I know, Ubasti.
- Ahh...

655
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,209
I think we have it.

656
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:13,214
I know where Cleocatra's tomb lies.

657
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,182
I don't know how much
farther I can go.

658
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:27,270
- We need water.
- We can't stop, dudes.

659
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,896
[all panting]

660
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,191
[chittering]

661
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,943
[Babi] This way, Babu.

662
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,492
Babi had brilliant plan
to slow down bad man.

663
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,161
What did you do, Uncle Babi?

664
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,205
Hold your camels, Babu.
You will see.

665
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,375
[chittering] Ahh!

666
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,930
- [laughs]
- [air hissing]

667
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:10,271
Yes, Ubasti,
we're getting very, very close.

668
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:15,026
What's that petty primate doing here?

669
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,986
Up to no good.

670
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,030
[Babi] Butjust when Babi
was almost complete,

671
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:22,116
hairless cat caught
Babi monkey-handed.

672
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:23,618
No, no, no, no.
Oh... Uh...

673
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:26,120
- [Babu] Oh, no!
- Never fear, Babu.

674
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:31,918
Babi scared cat with big muscles.

675
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,631
- [cat growls]
- Ah! Scary cat!

676
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,966
What do you think you're doing?

677
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:41,719
[chuckles] Nothing.

678
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,764
I've traveled far
to find Cleocatra's tomb,

679
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,100
and no one is going to stop me.

680
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,268
- [hissing]
- [screeches]

681
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,315
Ubasti. Kitty.

682
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:57,694
There you are, my little darling.

683
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,862
[indistinct chattering]

684
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:20,591
Hey! What's that?

685
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,930
What is it, Budderball?

686
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:30,518
Can't you see it? Food!
Hot dogs! Pizza!

687
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,980
And lemonade!
They've even got ice cream!

688
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,940
Oh, sweet mama!

689
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,989
[chortling]

690
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,996
Dudes, I think Budderball
has lost his marbles.

691
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,415
Budderball is seeing the mirage.

692
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,543
The heat makes your brain
do funny things sometimes.

693
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,253
Come on, guys, dig in!

694
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,589
Budderball, you gotta snap out of it!

695
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,718
[chortling continues]

696
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,428
[gagging]

697
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,139
Now that's what I call a sand-wich!

698
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,974
Where'd the buffet go?!

699
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:16,272
Look! What's that?!
It looks like trees!

700
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,067
Trees? You've gotta be
hallucin-a-trippin', dawg.

701
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,319
[shudders]

702
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,364
I can still see them, it's real!

703
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:28,159
And where there's trees,
there must be water.

704
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:32,038
- It's the oasis!
- We're saved, dudes!

705
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,681
[all panting]

706
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,104
Yo, dawgs, check it out.

707
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,250
I've never been so happy
to take a bath in my whole life!

708
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,961
- Surf's up, dudes!
- [Rosebud] Yippee!

709
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,420
All right!

710
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,802
There's no way I'm going in there
without my floaties, dawgs.

711
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,972
[Wellington] What now?

712
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,890
[Seti] Mr. Wellington,
I think we have a flat tire.

713
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,433
[Wellington grumbles]

714
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,604
My tribe and your tribe are not here.

715
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,606
They must've traveled on already.

716
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,901
What the...? What was that?

717
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:47,238
Relax, B-Dawg.
It was probably just the wind.

718
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:48,781
Ouch!

719
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:52,577
Then that wind has sick
paw-eye coordination.

720
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:54,537
[grunts]

721
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,998
Hey, they're falling
from that tree up there.

722
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:59,083
Those are dates, Rosebud.

723
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,298
[Buddies grunting]

724
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:09,468
- [Buddies] Babi?
- [blows raspberry, laughs]

725
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:16,851
Babi, we're so glad we found you!

726
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:20,897
Buddies and my camel friend,
I am so glad you have made it.

727
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,066
Babi, what happened
to Pete and Grandpa Thomas?

728
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,737
Babi was following boy
and men and cat.

729
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:32,533
Cat very scary. She find Babi,
so Babi run and hide in oasis.

730
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,995
- Are they OK?
- Very much so, friend Mudbud.

731
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,497
They are on their way
to Cleocatra's tomb.

732
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:42,501
That's great, dawg. Too bad
we have no idea where it is.

733
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,170
Babi has idea.

734
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,548
Babi see Bedouin tribe following,
they can help.

735
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:51,093
My mom! Come on, Buddies,
we'll go to the camp.

736
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,220
What about the others?
We can't let them

737
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:56,515
- get to the tomb before us.
- Babi has dealt with that.

738
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,898
Ifwe hurry, we can reach
the Bedouin tribe before nightfall.

739
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,363
This is outrageous!
How did this happen?

740
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,615
[both stammer]

741
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:16,494
This is... This is all
your fault, nitwits! Idiots!

742
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:19,622
Well, I guess we're going to
be stuck here for the night.

743
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,542
So we may as well make ourselves useful,
Pete, and unload the truck.

744
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:34,720
So, Babi, dawg, how 'bout
you give me back my bling?

745
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,598
Deal is deal, friend.
All trades are final.

746
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:40,559
I can't wait until
you meet my family, Buddies.

747
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,604
They will be very grateful
for all you have done.

748
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,523
[indistinct chattering]

749
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:51,112
That's it!
Many thanks to you, Buddies.

750
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:54,198
And you too, Babi. I'm home!

751
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:02,623
- Cammy!
- Mom!

752
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:07,211
- [sheep bleating]
- Oh! I can't believe it's you.

753
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,924
Cammy!

754
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:15,511
[kisses]

755
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:21,559
My dear Cammy, I thought
I would never see you again.

756
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,811
The bad man tried to sell me,

757
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:27,648
but my new friends, Babi and
the Buddies, helped me escape.

758
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:31,152
Oh, thank you so much
for bringing my baby back to me.

759
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,154
How could I ever repay you?

760
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:36,365
We could do lunch sometime,
soon preferably.

761
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:39,577
We welcomed the opportunity
to create good karma.

762
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:40,953
Namaste.

763
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:45,207
Yo, B-Dawg's the name,
and these dawgs are my tribe.

764
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,210
My name is Mala,
and my tribe would be thrilled

765
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,379
to have you as our honored guests.

766
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,176
[up-tempo music plays]

767
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:07,354
Yo, these dawgs got it going on.

768
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:16,280
Hmm. That looks like
an interesting game.

769
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:20,785
Here you go, Buddies,
dinner is served.

770
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,411
My three favorite words.

771
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:25,915
Pinch me, I wanna make sure
this isn't a mirage.

772
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,086
Cammy, no offense,

773
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,963
but my dinner looks
an awful lot like bugs.

774
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:37,259
- Dude, your dinner is bugs.
- Those are scarab beetles.

775
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,595
They are a delicacy of the Bedouins.

776
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:43,891
Do you have anything less delicate,
like pizza or maybe some hamburgers?

777
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,393
Whoa! Budderball turning down food?

778
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,479
Thatjust blew my mind.

779
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:51,941
They are quite good, Budderball.
I promise.

780
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,485
OK, here goes nothing.

781
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,153
Over the teeth, past the gums,

782
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:58,280
look out stomach,
here the bugs come.

783
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,162
Budderball like scarabs?

784
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:08,624
Crunchy, but not bad.
Tastes like chicken.

785
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,013
Ahh.

786
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:25,975
That archeologist
is getting far too nosy.

787
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:30,980
Typical American.
Can't mind his Ps and Qs.

788
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,899
But tomorrow, we'll be rid
of the wretched man

789
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:37,862
and his annoying grandson,
and the treasure will be mine.

790
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,531
Ours.

791
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:41,907
[both chuckle]

792
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:43,325
Thank you. Thank you.

793
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,827
[clattering]

794
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,162
- Hmm?
- Huh?

795
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,454
Oh, no.

796
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,541
[panting]

797
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,669
Grandpa!
Grandpa, wake up!

798
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:57,798
I heard Mr. Wellington
say he's gonna get rid of us

799
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,593
- and keep the treasure for himself!
- What?!

800
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,637
Peter, really?

801
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:10,102
Oh, no. I should've known
he was just a grave robber.

802
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:13,480
- What are we gonna do?
- Well, first off,

803
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:17,693
we need to be very careful.
Philip could be dangerous.

804
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,697
- [gasps]
- Could he, now?

805
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,324
I'm done helping you, Philip.

806
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,534
Oh, I think not, Professor Howard.

807
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,119
For the sake of your
precious grandson,

808
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,955
you'll do exactly
what I want you to do.

[indistinct chattering]

810
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,135
What are they doing?

811
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:47,056
They are sending balloon up in
sky to look for bad man and cat.

812
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:50,351
Babi believe this is the way
we find your people.

813
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,645
Travel by air is much, much faster.

814
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,772
Let me get this straight,
monkey dude,

815
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,774
you want us to fly up
in that balloon?

816
00:53:56,942 --> 00:54:00,069
Babi, do you know
how to fly that thing?

817
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,364
Babi is good pilot. The best.

818
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:10,037
Wind is going in the right direction.

819
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:14,917
[grunts]

820
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,170
Quick, Buddies, come!

821
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,348
[chittering]

822
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,309
[laughs]

823
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:41,193
Buddies, I can never
thank you enough.

824
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:45,155
[Mala] Bye, Buddies! Be safe!

825
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:48,325
Bye, Cammy. Bye, Mala!
I hope we see you again.

826
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:50,286
Good luck, Buddies!

[blows raspberry]

830
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,774
Look! It's the bad dude's Jeep.

831
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,027
We would've never found them on foot.

832
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:26,447
They must've gone in the truck.
Follow the tire tracks.

833
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:29,491
Babi does not control wind.
Allah does.

834
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:41,837
- [grunts]
- I think this is it, Peter.

835
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,971
So... Hmm? Where is it?

836
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:55,184
[exclaims]
I'm sure it's here somewhere.

837
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:59,313
- I can feel the energy.
- The energy?

838
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,732
[shudders mockingly]

839
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:06,487
You worthless twit.
You've led us nowhere!

840
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:09,114
Grandpa, look! A balloon!

841
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:13,869
Oh... [chuckles]
Oh, don't be silly, Peter.

842
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,289
There are no baboons in the desert.

843
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:20,667
I think maybe you've
been out in the sun too long.

844
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,169
You should drink some water.

845
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,636
Dudes, there they are!
Let's land this puppy!

846
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:33,180
- Land?
- Babi, please tell me

847
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,681
you know how to land this thing.

848
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:37,935
This part Babi is
not so familiar with.

849
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:41,230
Oh, great. We're just gonna
float away forever.

850
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,441
Don't worry, B-Dawg,
panic is a wasted emotion.

851
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:47,486
Babi know what make
balloon go down. Hold on.

852
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:54,076
[grunting]

853
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,499
[air hissing]

854
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,294
- Oh, no.
- [Buddies groaning]

855
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:05,546
[nervous laughter]

856
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:08,132
Forget about what I said before.
Time to panic.

857
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,591
[Buddies shouting]

858
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:13,470
- [Rosebud] Oh, no!
- Hold on, Buddies.

859
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:15,597
Going in for crash landing.

860
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,809
[all shouting, grunting]

861
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:26,191
- [chitters]
- [grunts]

862
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,195
- [groans]
- Oh.

863
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:33,866
- Babi is dizzy.
- You can say that again, dawg.

864
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,869
- Oh. Babi is dizzy.
- [groans]

865
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,001
[wind gusting]

866
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:47,671
It feels like there's
a sandstorm coming on.

867
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,549
No, nonsense.
Just a little breeze.

868
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:54,261
You two. Go to the top of that
dune and have a look around.

869
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,099
[shouting]

870
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,686
[gasps] It is a sandstorm.

871
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:05,189
- [wind howling]
- Huh?

872
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,036
[screaming]

873
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,537
Run for the truck, Peter!

874
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,753
Quickly, Buddies, we can
take shelter in that cave.

875
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,305
[frightened chittering]

876
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:41,058
[Seti] Be safe, Mr. Wellington!
Run, Mr. Wellington!

877
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:43,268
[storm groans]

878
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,688
[stammering]

879
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,374
This is most fortunate, my friends.

880
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,126
We shall be safe here
until the storm passes.

881
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:25,102
[shouts] Dawgs!
This is really freaking me out.

882
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:29,439
I believe this is
some sort of secret entrance

883
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:32,317
used by those who built
Cleocatra's tomb.

884
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:36,029
But this secret entrance
is protected by a large serpent.

885
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:37,990
Serpent? What's that?

886
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:40,993
It is a snake.
Babi no like snakes.

887
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,997
Ah! For once can't
something be easy-peasy?

888
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:49,418
Why can't it be protected by a
bunny rabbit or something vegetarian?

889
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,379
[hissing]

890
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:57,593
Uh, dudes, long, creepy,
slimy thing at 12 o'clock.

891
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,971
Hold it, hold it! Uncle B,
there's a snake coming?

892
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,889
Is this the part
where you save the Buddies?

893
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:07,102
Yes, big and slimy snake, but no fear.

894
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,979
No challenge too great for Babi.

895
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:11,023
Babi about to outwit snake.

896
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,400
I promise.

897
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:14,776
I am afraid where you go,

898
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:18,530
I cannot follow, Buddies.
[chittering]

899
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,452
Wait a second, wait a second.
You ran away?

900
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:28,040
Uh... Yes, Babi ran to see
if he could find help.

901
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:30,208
Babi is wise.

902
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:38,467
Uh... Buddha, what are you doin', dawg?

903
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,887
- Calm yourself, B-Dawg.
- [hissing]

904
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:49,603
I am Slither, the serpent
protector of Cleocatra's tomb.

905
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:53,023
We were hoping to secure your
permission to enter the tomb.

906
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,941
I was put here
to protect the tomb

907
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:58,654
from all those who would
seek its riches without wisdom.

908
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:02,616
Only the descendants
of Buddasi may pass.

909
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:05,452
You must look me in the eyes.

910
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:09,539
If I can hypnotize you,
then your intentions are not pure,

911
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:12,459
and you will become my supper.

912
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:15,712
That's the worst dinner invite
I've ever heard.

913
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,964
And if I win and hypnotize you?

914
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,926
Then you are descendants of Buddasi,

915
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:25,222
guardian of man,
and I will let you pass.

916
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,849
B-Dawg, remember the snake
at the bazaar?

917
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:30,352
- Uh-huh.
- Lay down some beats.

918
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,437
I think I gotcha, dawg.

919
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:35,065
I accept your challenge.

920
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,566
[stammers]

921
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:39,945
[beatboxing]

922
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:43,990
Shanti. Shanti.

923
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:46,118
Shanti.

924
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:49,830
- [music continues]
- [Buddha] Shanti. Shanti.

925
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:57,504
Shanti. Shanti.

926
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,132
- Shanti...
- [B-Dawg stops music]

927
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,467
He's gone.

928
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,137
Buddha, you won.

929
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:08,056
- Way to go, dude.
- All right, Buddha!

930
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:15,147
You are the descendants of Buddasi!

931
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:18,525
I have been waiting
so long for you.

932
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:23,739
You and your friends may pass,
but beware ofwhat's ahead,

933
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:27,659
for there are more tests
along this path.

934
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:34,624
[hissing]

935
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:49,264
If you need Slither again,
I will be here... waiting.

936
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:52,684
Good luck, Buddies.

937
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,645
You heard the serpent dude.
Let's be careful.

938
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:57,606
You never know
what's around the next corner.

939
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:00,817
[stammers] In that case,
ladies first.

940
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:11,703
[grunts]

941
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:24,216
Grandpa, look!

942
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:34,100
- Oh, my.
- [exhales softly]

943
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,813
It's Cleocatra's tomb.

944
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:41,399
We're rich, my dear. We're rich.

945
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:48,406
Only in my dreams
have I imagined this moment.

946
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,455
Hey, Tarik.

947
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:58,917
Tarik, we're alive! Tarik!
[laughing]

948
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:02,587
This is a single stone slab.

949
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:05,006
It must weigh thousands of pounds.

950
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:07,592
There's no way we can open it
without heavy equipment.

951
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,094
Even then it'll take months.

952
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:13,348
No, it won't. Why do you think
I brought the explosives?

953
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,642
For a fireworks display?

954
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,228
[Thomas] But the tomb
is thousands of years old.

955
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:21,523
- We can'tjust use dynamite on it.
- Watch me.

956
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,693
Tarik! Seti! Get the explosives.

957
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:34,327
Oh, no! Quicksand!

958
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,376
How will we get across?

959
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,836
No problem-o, dudes,

960
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,297
I'm an expert
in all things dirt-related.

961
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:46,965
Just roll with it.

962
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:50,302
[grunting]

963
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,054
[laughing]

964
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,352
Huh?

965
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:02,564
[rumbling]

966
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,902
You can make your way
across now, dudes and dudette.

967
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:22,500
The discovery of Cleocatra's
tomb is priceless.

968
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:25,045
- It belongs to the Egyptian people.
- Oh, please.

969
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:27,797
I'm every bit the archeologist
you are, Professor Howard.

970
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:30,717
I simply do it for profit,
not for silly accolades.

971
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:34,179
No, Mr. Wellington, what you do
is illegal and immoral.

972
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:38,058
Grandpa! There's a slot in the door.

973
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:40,977
No, Pete!
Get away from there!

974
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:52,113
Huh?

975
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:57,827
- The disk. Philip.
- Yes, yes.

976
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:00,914
[soft, eerie echoing]

977
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:07,712
[gears clanking]

978
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,716
[inhales deeply]

979
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:15,428
There, you see?
I've gotten you here.

980
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:18,014
Come along, Peter.

981
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:27,899
That's weird.
The oil torches are lit.

982
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:29,317
Someone else is here.

983
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:33,780
It can only be those filthy mutts.
They've beaten me to it.

984
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:37,283
The opening of the door must've
triggered the lighting of the torches.

985
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:39,577
What is it, Ubasti? No, no, no.

986
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:41,746
Ubasti, come back here.
Ubasti.

987
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:43,123
[meowing]

988
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,750
Ubasti. Whoo-hoo, Ubasti.

989
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:47,919
Ubasti?

990
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:56,553
[gasps]

991
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:03,351
I sure wish... that ancient
Egyptians... invented elevators.

992
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,650
Yo, what's the holdup?

993
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:13,737
There's something strange
about this hallway.

994
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:17,282
You guys are worrying too much.

995
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,534
This room looks
pretty normal to me.

996
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,578
Remember what Slither said.

997
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:24,456
Ah, that snake's been
trapped here too long.

998
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:26,458
He's loony, yo. [screams]

999
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,838
And then, B-Dawg
fell into the pit of snakes.

1000
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:34,049
- Oh, no!
- Don't worry.

1001
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:38,470
At the last second, Babi grabbed
B-Dawg's tail and save him.

1002
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:39,888
B-Dawg! [grunts]

1003
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:45,810
I thought you ran out of the
tomb when the scary snake came.

1004
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:47,937
You worry too much about details.

1005
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:52,442
Anyway, like I said,
Budderball grabbed B-Dawg's tail.

1006
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,235
[shouting]

1007
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:55,820
- [hissing]
- [Budderball grunting]

1008
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:58,448
Hang on, Budderball's
got you by the tail.

1009
01:07:58,616 --> 01:07:59,616
[exclaims]

1010
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:03,912
- Hurry!
- [struggling]

1011
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:12,670
Ahh. You know what?
I'm gonna bounce.

1012
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:15,548
What do you say I meet you
dawgs back in Fernfield?

1013
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:19,761
Hmm.

1014
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:25,350
Hmm. It's ancient writing
called hieroglyphics.

1015
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:28,436
I saw Bedouins playing this,
but much smaller.

1016
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:32,524
You have to get to the other side,
but can only move on specific squares.

1017
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:35,360
All right, boys,
let a girl show you the way.

1018
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,029
[grunting]

1019
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:50,250
Come on, boys, jump only
on the squares that I did.

1020
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:54,712
[grunting]

1021
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,052
[all grunting]

1022
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:06,808
[exclaims]

1023
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:21,614
Dudes, I don't get it.
It's just a big, empty room.

1024
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,662
Not a good sign.

1025
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:34,711
[gasps]

1026
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:36,671
Mmm.

1027
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,047
[chewing sounds]

1028
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:44,137
- Bugs. I love bugs.
- That's disgusting.

1029
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:48,433
Hmm. A little slimy when they're
uncooked, but still not bad.

1030
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:55,982
Dawg, I don't think they
appreciate you eating their cousin.

1031
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:03,698
Hey, it's another one of those buttons.

1032
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:06,117
[Buddies shouting]

1033
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:21,925
- [door rumbling]
- [Buddies panting]

1034
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,763
Dudes, this looks like Cleocatra's tomb.

1035
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:33,811
It's the lost collar of Cleocatra.

1036
01:10:38,525 --> 01:10:41,611
Oh, no. It's a quicksand trap.

1037
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:44,280
Tarik, we need a bridge.
Lie down.

1038
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:46,658
[stammering protest]

1039
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:48,701
Well, all right.
Seti, you lie down.

1040
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:50,495
Yes, you do it, Seti!

1041
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:51,955
- [shouts]
- Tarik!

1042
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:54,958
- I'm very sorry!
- Well done, well done. Yes, very brave.

1043
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:57,585
Very brave. [humming]

1044
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:00,004
[Tarik groaning]

1045
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:02,632
Are you ready? All right.

1046
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,010
There you go. I got you.
Move it, move it. Careful.

1047
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:09,222
- Careful, Peter. Come on, Peter.
- I'm so sorry.

1048
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,599
- [grunts]
- [Thomas] Tarik.

1049
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,476
- [Tarik sobbing]
- Very safe. Here we go.

1050
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:15,812
It's OK. Very strong.

1051
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:21,067
I am coming. [panicked grunting]

1052
01:11:25,155 --> 01:11:27,365
Right, well, carry on.

1053
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,494
- What do you think it means, Grandpa?
- [rumbling]

1054
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:33,663
It's raising him up!

1055
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:37,875
[Seti laughing] Tarik!
Tarik, you're safe!

1056
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:42,046
Tarik, you're safe!

1057
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:44,966
What should we do?

1058
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,552
We've gotta take the
collar for safekeeping,

1059
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,054
so Ubasti doesn't get her paws on it.

1060
01:11:50,222 --> 01:11:53,850
Notjust for us,
but for all mankind and dogkind.

1061
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:57,603
That bling is super fly, yo.
I'll get it.

1062
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:10,325
B-Dawg, why are you wearing the collar?

1063
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:13,494
Relax, sis.
I gave that monkey my bling,

1064
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:16,247
so I'm just borrowing this
until we get home.

1065
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:21,878
Ubasti?

1066
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:25,840
Now, if you would kindly hand over
what is rightfully mine.

1067
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:28,176
Seems to me you're outnumbered
five-to-one.

1068
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,803
Hmm. Well, we'll see about that.

1069
01:12:30,971 --> 01:12:32,638
[faint meowing]

1070
01:12:32,806 --> 01:12:37,226
Guys, is itjust me,
or are those statues moving?

1071
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:42,982
I believe the numbers just got
more in my favor, Blubberball.

1072
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:45,610
- Uh-oh.
- I'd like to remain optimistic, but

1073
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:48,529
- they definitely don't seem friendly.
- [hissing]

1074
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:49,989
Run, dudes, run!

1075
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:52,784
[Buddies panting]

1076
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:59,082
[cats hissing, yowling]

1077
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:00,458
[whimpering]

1078
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,126
Seti.

1079
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:04,837
- Oh.
- [hissing]

1080
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:10,301
Wow, it's like Senet,
the ancient Egyptian board game.

1081
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,388
Well, right, off you go.

1082
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:15,723
- [screams]
- [all shouting]

1083
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:17,183
Wait, no. No.

1084
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,811
- No!
- Don't look, Peter.

1085
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:24,649
Well, Tarik, you're next. Off you go!

1086
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:28,778
[shouting in foreign language]

1087
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:32,490
I think we've lost them.

1088
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:38,746
Yo, dawgs, I feel kinda weird.

1089
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:41,082
- Meow!
- Did you just meow?

1090
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:44,335
Oh, no you didn't
call me a scaredy-cat.

1091
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:46,754
Them be fighting words. Meow.

1092
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:49,173
I'm pretty sure you just meowed, dude.

1093
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:51,259
There's no way I just meowed.

1094
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:54,637
I believe it's imperative that
we remove the collar from B-Dawg.

1095
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:56,556
It appears to be
turning him into a cat.

1096
01:13:56,723 --> 01:14:00,351
Meow... No!
You cannot take my bling.

1097
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:04,647
- Meow!
- B-Dawg, no! Come back here!

1098
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:07,108
[hissing, growling]

1099
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:08,609
Let's divide and conquer.

1100
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:18,953
- I can do it, Grandpa.
- Wait, Peter. Listen to me.

1101
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,705
Do it.

1102
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,334
Only jump on the squares
I tell you, all right?

1103
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:26,544
Uh-huh.

1104
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:28,254
Start here.

1105
01:14:29,673 --> 01:14:31,507
Now, plow.

1106
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:34,302
Lion.

1107
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:36,262
Man.

1108
01:14:38,515 --> 01:14:39,849
Trees.

1109
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,894
And life.

1110
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,605
Come on, Grandpa.

1111
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:47,440
After you.

1112
01:14:59,953 --> 01:15:02,580
[grunting]

1113
01:15:07,419 --> 01:15:09,128
[both growling]

1114
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:11,672
[hissing]

1115
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,091
Come play in the kitty litter, dudettes.

1116
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:20,014
[both meowing]

1117
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:30,691
[panting]

1118
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,911
[hissing, yowling]

1119
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:45,373
That'll teach them to underestimate
a blond with a pink bow.

1120
01:15:54,466 --> 01:15:56,676
[both growling]

1121
01:15:56,843 --> 01:15:59,095
Wait. I just need a little lunch break.

1122
01:16:00,472 --> 01:16:02,390
Hey, bugs, bon appétit!

1123
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:12,525
Ahh!

1124
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:14,235
[growling softly]

1125
01:16:16,196 --> 01:16:19,657
- [faint howling]
- Whoa! The service must be terrible.

1126
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:31,085
[both growling, hissing]

1127
01:16:32,546 --> 01:16:35,506
I believe meditation
can help with your anger issues.

1128
01:16:43,974 --> 01:16:46,642
You will become my supper.

1129
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:50,062
- [hissing]
- [both growling]

1130
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,274
[cats yowl]

1131
01:17:03,493 --> 01:17:06,871
- It's amazing!
- I don't believe it.

1132
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:12,168
There's... There's nothing here.

1133
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:14,170
Someone beat us to it.

1134
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:18,674
- [panting]
- [squeaking]

1135
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:22,970
A mouse?
I love chasing mice! Meow!

1136
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:34,482
[sniffing]

1137
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,280
[screams]
It's my worst nightmare.

1138
01:17:41,448 --> 01:17:45,076
I'm turning into a cat.
Get this collar off me!

1139
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:54,669
- Are you OK, B-Dawg?
- I... I think so.

1140
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:57,672
[stammers, gagging]

1141
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:04,595
Eww, gross, hairball.

1142
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:07,139
I almost crossed over to the dark side.

1143
01:18:10,727 --> 01:18:12,395
[Ubasti cackles]

1144
01:18:12,562 --> 01:18:15,648
- It's finally mine.
- The collar!

1145
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,781
This is, perhaps, the greatest

1146
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:27,451
historical discovery
since King Tut's tomb!

1147
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:29,954
You were right, Grandpa.

1148
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:41,048
The necklace.

1149
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:43,259
You found it, Ubasti.

1150
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:47,096
Ooh, bring it to me,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Yes.

1151
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:49,473
- [howls]
- Ow!

1152
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:52,935
- [growling softly]
- Ubasti!

1153
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:55,187
[cackling]

1154
01:18:55,355 --> 01:19:00,401
Finally, the moment I've
been waiting for my whole life!

1155
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:03,154
Now is the time for cats to rule.

1156
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:04,321
Huh?

1157
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:07,324
First, dogs will be banished.

1158
01:19:07,492 --> 01:19:09,452
- [barks]
- [Ubasti cackles]

1159
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:17,126
Your best friends here will be
nothing more than my slaves.

[cackling]

1161
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,966
It's happening!

1162
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:34,477
- [both gasp]
- Ubasti?

1163
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:39,648
Mudbud?

1164
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:42,777
How did you get here?

1165
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:51,035
My goodness!

1166
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:56,999
It's mine.
Get out of my way!

1167
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:58,709
I'm rich!

1168
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:03,881
Philip, I can't let you steal
these invaluable artifacts.

1169
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:06,926
You can't?
I can take anything I like.

1170
01:20:07,093 --> 01:20:09,303
- Who's going to stop me?
- Me!

1171
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,680
[laughs]

1172
01:20:11,848 --> 01:20:14,725
Oh, professor,
it might interest you to know

1173
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:16,852
that I was fencing champion at Oxford.

1174
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:20,564
- So be it!
- [both grunting]

1175
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:22,066
[chuckles]

1176
01:20:28,406 --> 01:20:29,615
- [gasps]
- Ole!

1177
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:31,408
[laughs] En garde.

- [grunting]
- [gasps]

1179
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:34,161
And he joust.

1180
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:36,831
- And he parry.
- Ooh.

1181
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:39,959
And Babi helped swordfight bad man.

1182
01:20:40,126 --> 01:20:43,754
But how could you swordfight if you
weren't there, Uncle Babi? Remember?

1183
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:45,840
Do you want me to
tell this story or not?

1184
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:49,051
Now, the ending is coming soon.
Hold on to your banana.

1185
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:50,970
[both grunting]

1186
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:02,314
Is that all you've got, old man?

1187
01:21:02,482 --> 01:21:04,316
Nope. This is.

1188
01:21:04,484 --> 01:21:05,651
[clanging echoing]

1189
01:21:08,071 --> 01:21:10,281
I... I...

- [exhales]
- [Buddies panting]

1191
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:18,539
- Grandpa!
- [laughing] Peter!

1192
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:22,418
- Thank you so much.
- What happened?

1193
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:25,546
[Thomas] It says here there was
a curse put on the gem

1194
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:28,632
to prevent any cat
from misusing it again.

1195
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:33,429
If a cat was greedy for power,
it would get everlasting life,

1196
01:21:33,597 --> 01:21:36,140
- but in the form of a statue.
- [Wellington laughing]

1197
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:37,349
Philip!

1198
01:21:37,517 --> 01:21:39,018
[Peter] Let's get him, Grandpa!

1199
01:21:39,185 --> 01:21:41,937
Come back here, Philip!
Get him!

1200
01:21:42,772 --> 01:21:43,772
[Peter] He's getting away!

1201
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:48,777
But where's Uncle Babi this whole time?

1202
01:21:48,945 --> 01:21:51,030
Good question, my nephew.

1203
01:21:51,197 --> 01:21:55,326
It is now time for Uncle Babi
to save the day!

1204
01:21:55,493 --> 01:22:00,539
Babi, the hero of all heroes, the
great adventurer, the world famous...

1205
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:02,041
[Babu] OK, OK, I got it.

1206
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:06,170
Now tell Babu the ending.
I am on the edge of my hammock.

1207
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:17,348
[panting]

1208
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:24,563
[gasps]

1209
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:27,399
[indistinct chattering]

1210
01:22:27,567 --> 01:22:28,901
Let's get him, Cammy.

1211
01:22:32,322 --> 01:22:33,530
[laughing]

1212
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:37,284
- Bad man. Bad man.
- [grunting] Ow!

1213
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:40,204
- Very, very, very bad man! Bad!
- Ow! Ow!

1214
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:43,290
[grunting]

1215
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:46,251
- Bad, bad man!
- Get this monkey off my back!

1216
01:22:46,419 --> 01:22:48,921
[shouts, grunts]

1217
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:51,215
Nobody messes with my friends.

1218
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:53,509
[sputtering]

1219
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:56,720
I can't see.

1220
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:07,314
We know all about you, grave robber,
raider of sacred places.

1221
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:11,902
- Amir Sabak, Egyptian Secret Service.
- Oh.

1222
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:14,321
You are under arrest,
Mr. Wellington.

1223
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:16,198
[stammers]

1224
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,995
[up-tempo music plays]

1225
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:30,671
[indistinct chattering]

1226
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:42,099
Thank you for your
great discovery, Mr. Howard.

1227
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:44,101
The Egyptian government
is most grateful,

1228
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:47,187
and is willing to compensate you
for your efforts, of course.

1229
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:51,191
- You are a national hero.
- Finding the treasure

1230
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:53,986
is all the compensation
an archeologist needs.

1231
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:55,696
And if I'm a hero,

1232
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:59,908
then my young archeologist
partner is one, too.

1233
01:24:00,076 --> 01:24:02,036
Without him, I wouldn't
be standing here right now.

1234
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:06,707
Thanks, Grandpa, but the Buddies
deserve a lot of the credit.

1235
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,459
We'd like to thank you two dudes.

1236
01:24:08,626 --> 01:24:10,252
We couldn't have done it without you.

1237
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:13,172
Yeah, dawgs, you two are da bomb.

1238
01:24:13,339 --> 01:24:17,134
- It was Babi's pleasure.
- And mine, too.

1239
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:18,886
Maybe we'll see you both again.

1240
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,929
Next time there is
a treasure to be found,

1241
01:24:21,097 --> 01:24:22,890
Babi will be happy to help.

1242
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,810
[Wellington] In the name of
Her Majesty, the Queen, untie me!

1243
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:28,937
Take me to the British Embassy.

1244
01:24:29,105 --> 01:24:30,522
We must go now and take this

1245
01:24:30,690 --> 01:24:32,775
dirty grave robber to the jail,
where he belongs.

1246
01:24:32,942 --> 01:24:34,943
Thank you, again.

1247
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:37,988
If there is anything I can do for you,
please, let me know.

1248
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:41,992
Amir, I do actually have a request.

1249
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:53,837
First off, I'd like to thank
the Egyptian government

1250
01:24:54,005 --> 01:24:58,467
for allowing the debut
of this great archeological find

1251
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:03,472
to happen here in our hometown
of Fernfield, saving our museum.

1252
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:06,183
And I must extend my gratitude

1253
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:10,646
to six very important
little archeologists.

1254
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:13,482
First, my grandson, Peter.

1255
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:16,860
And then, of course, the Buddies!

1256
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:20,072
And now, without further ado...

1257
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:24,701
...the lost Cat's Eye necklace
of Cleocatra.

1258
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:26,537
[audience applauds]

1259
01:25:28,748 --> 01:25:29,998
Wow.

1260
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:33,544
If only your great grandpappy,
Digger, could see you.

1261
01:25:33,711 --> 01:25:38,799
Chips off the old block,
five doggone explorer pups.

1262
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:44,304
- He'd be very proud.
- That's a cool necklace.

1263
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:47,933
Yes, it is beautiful, isn't it, Pete?

1264
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:51,812
And I'm glad we found it
so the world can enjoy it, too.

1265
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:55,065
But I learned a very
important lesson on this trip,

1266
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:59,403
more valuable than
even gold orjewels.

1267
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:04,408
I have the greatest treasure
in the world right here.

1268
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:15,127
[Thomas] I hope it will be safe, Amir.

1269
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:17,921
We wouldn't want that necklace
falling into the wrong hands.

1270
01:26:18,089 --> 01:26:19,256
Worry not, my friend.

1271
01:26:22,468 --> 01:26:25,179
- [lock clicking]
- [electric buzzing]

1272
01:26:28,641 --> 01:26:31,185
No man will be able to get through that.

1273
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:46,450
[creaking]

1274
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:48,744
[chittering]

1275
01:26:51,414 --> 01:26:53,749
[Babi continues chittering]

1276
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:56,793
And that is the story
of the greatest treasure

1277
01:26:56,961 --> 01:26:59,421
- Babi ever discovered.
- [squeaks]

1278
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:05,344
- [chittering]
- Wait. Where is Babu going?

1279
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:07,971
That was amazing story, Uncle Babi.

1280
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:11,475
- But...
- Babi no like "but."

1281
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:13,644
Babu knows Uncle Babi exaggerates.

1282
01:27:13,811 --> 01:27:15,437
Scare off cat with big muscles,

1283
01:27:15,605 --> 01:27:18,732
save Budderball from snake pit,
swordfight with humans?

1284
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:23,362
All tall tales. Babu not even sure
Babi is real treasure hunter.

1285
01:27:23,529 --> 01:27:24,947
Babu going back to Cairo

1286
01:27:25,114 --> 01:27:27,741
to see if Babu can get back
into organ grinder school.

1287
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:29,534
OK, fine, Babu.

1288
01:27:29,702 --> 01:27:33,497
'Tis true, Babi tend to exaggerate,
just a little bit.

1289
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:36,124
But this adventure story is true.

1290
01:27:36,292 --> 01:27:38,752
Babi really meet the treasure Buddies.

1291
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,755
Sorry, Babi,
you cry monkey too many times.

1292
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:43,924
Maybe this will change your mind?

1293
01:27:45,551 --> 01:27:47,135
[chitters, grunts]

1294
01:27:49,138 --> 01:27:50,847
[laughing]

1295
01:27:52,141 --> 01:27:54,184
The lost collar of Cleocatra!

1296
01:28:56,914 --> 01:28:59,750
Oh, no you didn't
call me a scaredy-cat.

1297
01:28:59,917 --> 01:29:01,418
Them be fighting words.

1298
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:05,088
That'll teach them to underestimate
a blond with a pink bow.

1299
01:29:05,256 --> 01:29:06,757
No problem-o, dudes.

1300
01:29:06,924 --> 01:29:09,468
I'm an expert in
all things dirt-related.

1301
01:29:09,635 --> 01:29:11,928
Fate set us on this path, Mudbud.

1302
01:29:12,096 --> 01:29:14,056
Every journey has a deeper reason.

1303
01:29:14,223 --> 01:29:15,932
Over the teeth, past the gums,

1304
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:18,560
look out stomach,
here the bugs come.

1305
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:20,395
I met your great grandpappy

1306
01:29:20,563 --> 01:29:22,773
when I was knee-high
to a grasshopper.

1307
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:27,444
I am Slither, the serpent
protector of Cleocatra's tomb.

1308
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:31,573
There's nothing I detest more
than a petty primate thief.

1309
01:29:32,241 --> 01:29:35,118
It is a snake.
Babi no like snakes.

1310
01:29:35,286 --> 01:29:37,662
Is this another one
of your tall tales, Uncle Babi?

1311
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:40,082
My mom says
you exaggerate sometimes.

1312
01:29:40,249 --> 01:29:42,292
Budderball is seeing the mirage.

1313
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:45,462
The heat makes your brain
do funny things sometimes.

1314
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:48,423
My name is Mala,
and my tribe would be thrilled

1315
01:29:48,591 --> 01:29:50,300
to have you
as our honored guests.

1316
01:29:50,968 --> 01:29:52,803
