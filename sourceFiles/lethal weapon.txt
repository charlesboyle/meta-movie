1
00:04:41,717 --> 00:04:43,552
Surprise!

2
00:04:44,136 --> 00:04:46,764
Happy Birthday, Daddy!

3
00:04:56,232 --> 00:04:57,818
Make a wish!

4
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:00,154
I wish...
I'm not going to tell you.

5
00:05:00,404 --> 00:05:02,281
Come on, blow them out!

6
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,913
Give me some sugar, girl.

7
00:05:09,413 --> 00:05:12,375
One more candle and the smoke alarm
would've gone off.

8
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:18,256
The big 5- 0.

9
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,637
You know, your beard's getting gray.
Kind of makes you look old.

10
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:25,722
It's all right. I still love you.

11
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:28,475
Bye, Pa.

12
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,970
Good morning!

13
00:07:19,513 --> 00:07:22,182
- Where's Rianne?
- She's upstairs.

14
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,310
Good morning.

15
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,562
- That's my bacon!
- It's mine now.

16
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:29,940
Don't you close doors around here?

17
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:31,858
Baby, what's this on my tie?

18
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,946
That is an ugly spot.

19
00:07:35,196 --> 00:07:37,407
Thanks. Sharp as a tack.

20
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:40,035
I'm thinking of going on Jeopardy.

21
00:07:40,703 --> 00:07:43,122
Just don't take any questions
about cooking.

22
00:07:47,543 --> 00:07:49,378
Don't step in the egg!

23
00:07:50,587 --> 00:07:54,049
What am I thinking? I should have
checked the floor for egg!

24
00:07:55,884 --> 00:07:59,430
Do you know a man named Michael Hunsaker?

25
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:04,394
Jesus! Michael Hunsaker!

26
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:06,689
- What did he want?
- Your office called.

27
00:08:07,023 --> 00:08:09,150
He's tried to reach you for three days.

28
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,235
I haven't talked to him in...

29
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:14,363
...twelve years!

30
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:16,532
Wait a minute.

31
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:18,743
That would make me...

32
00:08:19,744 --> 00:08:21,078
...fifty!

33
00:08:21,747 --> 00:08:23,248
That means that you're...

34
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,834
We're not gonna discuss it.

35
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:27,753
Forget the eggs.

36
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:33,759
How come I never heard
of Michael Hunsaker?

37
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:35,719
Just never talked about him.

38
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:37,430
Vietnam buddy?

39
00:08:37,764 --> 00:08:39,766
Eat your own cake. Vietnam buddy.

40
00:08:41,642 --> 00:08:43,437
Nick and the kids left without me.

41
00:08:43,687 --> 00:08:47,107
He left without you? Come on,
I never get enough of my baby.

42
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:51,028
This is my New Year's Eve dress.
Do you like it? Isn't it cool?

43
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:52,655
It's beautiful.

44
00:08:54,573 --> 00:08:56,408
Have a good birthday.

45
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,628
Goddamn heartbreaker!

46
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,811
Happy birthday, Rog!

47
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,823
We got a hooker.

48
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:36,660
No, it's Dixie. Would you please
tell these bozos to lay off?

49
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,203
You bozos, lay off.

50
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:41,165
Had a jumper here last night.
She saw it happen.

51
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:43,334
Get her statement, send her home.

52
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:46,255
Thanks. I'm beat.
You know how it is.

53
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:48,716
All dressed up, no one to blow.

54
00:09:49,675 --> 00:09:52,511
You're hilarious!
I can't believe you damn cops!

55
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:55,431
The jumper's name is Amanda Hunsaker.

56
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,850
Age 22.

57
00:09:58,142 --> 00:10:02,104
Prostitute. One arrest,
no convictions. Born in Tennessee.

58
00:10:02,354 --> 00:10:04,023
- Parents...
- What was the name?

59
00:10:05,357 --> 00:10:06,901
The parents.

60
00:10:07,986 --> 00:10:09,529
Michael and Claire.

61
00:10:10,739 --> 00:10:12,033
You know them?

62
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:16,078
Right. Find out who bought it,
who's paying the bills.

63
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:18,914
- That will take some looking into.
- So look!

64
00:10:45,985 --> 00:10:47,362
Hello, honey.

65
00:10:48,572 --> 00:10:51,075
Give me the number for Michael Hunsaker.

66
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,994
The man we talked about?
Your Vietnam buddy?

67
00:10:54,244 --> 00:10:57,414
- You just mentioned him this morning.
- What's wrong?

68
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,917
His daughter just dove out a window.

69
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,048
I got it.

70
00:11:25,444 --> 00:11:27,363
Good, huh? Tasty? Smooth?

71
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,286
- Yeah, that's good.
- You better fucking believe it.

72
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:35,622
Let's do it. How much?

73
00:11:35,872 --> 00:11:37,582
How much for how much?

74
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,501
For all of it.

75
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:42,838
You want it all? He wants it all.

76
00:11:43,046 --> 00:11:45,967
- All right!
- Maybe a nice tree to put it under.

77
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,219
You want a tree?

78
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:49,971
I'll tell you what.

79
00:11:50,304 --> 00:11:53,142
I'll give you the best tree
on the lot for nothing.

80
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:55,811
But the shit's gonna cost you...

81
00:11:56,645 --> 00:11:57,813
...a hundred.

82
00:11:58,105 --> 00:11:58,981
That much?

83
00:11:59,273 --> 00:12:01,025
That's a fair price.

84
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:04,653
You only live once.

85
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:06,822
Get this together here.

86
00:12:08,282 --> 00:12:09,950
20, 40...

87
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,368
...50, 70....

88
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:14,748
- What the fuck?
- Hey, man!

89
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:17,460
Shut up, I'm losing count.

90
00:12:17,877 --> 00:12:20,338
93, 94, 95, 96....

91
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:22,131
Forget it, dumbshit!

92
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:24,467
One hundred thousand!

93
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:27,178
One hundred thousand dollars!

94
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,181
A hundred thousand?

95
00:12:30,514 --> 00:12:34,895
I can't afford that. Not on my salary.
But look, I got a better idea.

96
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:39,691
Let me say I take the whole stash
off your hands for free...

97
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:43,862
...and you assholes go to jail.
What do you say?

98
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:49,869
I could read you your rights, but you
already know what your rights are.

99
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:55,125
This badge ain't real.

100
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:56,669
You ain't real.

101
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:59,338
You sure are a crazy son of a bitch.

102
00:13:01,757 --> 00:13:02,758
I'm crazy?

103
00:13:03,842 --> 00:13:05,886
You think I am crazy?

104
00:13:06,095 --> 00:13:07,721
I'll show you...

105
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:14,269
That's a real badge, I'm a real cop
and this is a real gun.

106
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,606
Okay, pal.

107
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:18,608
Noses in the dirt, assholes!

108
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:32,248
Where's your buddy?

109
00:13:36,378 --> 00:13:37,295
What do you got?

110
00:13:37,587 --> 00:13:40,882
Three down and one loose.
He's got a red shirt.

111
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:42,551
Okay, let's go.

112
00:13:44,594 --> 00:13:47,431
Freeze! Give me the gun! Up, up!

113
00:13:48,432 --> 00:13:50,100
How's it feel, sucker?

114
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:51,644
Shoot him!

115
00:13:51,936 --> 00:13:52,854
Drop it!

116
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:54,772
Shoot him! Shoot him!

117
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:57,568
- Shut the fuck up!
- Shoot this prick!

118
00:13:58,777 --> 00:14:01,280
Shoot him! Somebody shoot this prick!

119
00:14:01,613 --> 00:14:02,948
Shoot me.

120
00:14:03,282 --> 00:14:05,534
Shut up! Put them down!

121
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:08,954
- I warn you! I'm going to shoot you!
- Shoot him!

122
00:14:09,204 --> 00:14:10,998
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

123
00:14:11,248 --> 00:14:13,375
Shoot me! Shoot him!

124
00:14:20,925 --> 00:14:22,302
Get him out of there.

125
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:25,306
It ain't worth it.

126
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:35,524
Hey, wait up already!

127
00:17:04,018 --> 00:17:05,688
Merry Christmas!

128
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:35,761
I miss you...

129
00:17:38,431 --> 00:17:40,099
...Victoria Lynn.

130
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:56,074
That's silly, isn't it?

131
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,666
I'll see you later.

132
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,420
I'll see you much later.

133
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:16,221
Once more with feeling on three.

134
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:21,226
Damn it, Cooley. Do it on three,
or go on the street.

135
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:28,525
Silent night

136
00:18:29,444 --> 00:18:32,072
Are you telling me
Riggs is playing a game?

137
00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:35,743
Sure. He wants the cash.
But he'll come around.

138
00:18:36,077 --> 00:18:38,329
That's a very dangerous
attitude to take.

139
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:43,250
Remember, his wife of 11 years
was just killed in a car accident.

140
00:18:43,626 --> 00:18:47,421
- He pulls his gun when he shouldn't.
- I know all about him.

141
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:48,881
He's a tough bastard.

142
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,344
He's on the edge. I'm telling you,
he may be psychotic.

143
00:18:52,552 --> 00:18:54,513
That's a bunch of psych bullshit.

144
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:57,599
You're making a mistake
by keeping him in the field.

145
00:18:57,933 --> 00:18:59,601
The man is suicidal.

146
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:02,646
You're sure of that diagnosis?
You have no doubts?

147
00:19:02,938 --> 00:19:04,606
There are no absolutes in life.

148
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:07,443
End of discussion.
We're going to wait.

149
00:19:07,777 --> 00:19:10,405
If he offs himself,
then we'll know I was wrong.

150
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:13,951
You're making a mistake,
because if you're wrong...

151
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,793
Asshole!

152
00:19:23,335 --> 00:19:25,963
Roger, you're way behind the times.

153
00:19:26,213 --> 00:19:30,134
The guys in the 80s aren't tough.
They're sensitive people.

154
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:33,513
They show emotions around women,
shit like that.

155
00:19:35,265 --> 00:19:36,808
I think I'm an 80s man.

156
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:38,561
How do you figure?

157
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,229
Last night...

158
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,648
...I cried in bed. How's that?

159
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:47,361
Were you with a woman?

160
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,282
I was alone. Why do you think
I was crying? Merry Christmas.

161
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:53,660
Sounds like an 80s man to me.

162
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:56,830
- News on the Hunsaker case.
- That was quick.

163
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,500
So was the autopsy.
They're not calling it a suicide.

164
00:20:01,126 --> 00:20:05,047
Surprise, surprise. The coroner
found evidence she used barbiturates.

165
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:07,257
Brilliant detective work.

166
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:09,177
There were pills all over.

167
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:11,804
Right. That's not the surprise.

168
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:14,600
The surprise is the pills were doctored.

169
00:20:15,184 --> 00:20:17,686
The capsules were loaded with drain cleaner.

170
00:20:17,895 --> 00:20:19,104
She'd have died anyway.

171
00:20:19,313 --> 00:20:20,314
This case stinks.

172
00:20:20,564 --> 00:20:24,318
You know, you looked younger with the beard.

173
00:20:24,943 --> 00:20:26,320
Thanks, captain.

174
00:20:28,155 --> 00:20:29,239
You shaved the beard.

175
00:20:29,698 --> 00:20:30,949
Some detective.

176
00:20:31,492 --> 00:20:32,785
Two more things.

177
00:20:33,702 --> 00:20:36,164
The condition of the sheets indicates...

178
00:20:36,498 --> 00:20:39,501
...someone else was in bed with Amanda.
That's "A"

179
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,669
What's "B"?

180
00:20:41,003 --> 00:20:44,215
"B" is, you're breaking in
a new partner on this.

181
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:45,508
Partner again?

182
00:20:45,758 --> 00:20:49,220
Some cat on loan from Dope.
Real burnout, on the edge.

183
00:20:49,553 --> 00:20:50,596
Perfect.

184
00:20:53,224 --> 00:20:54,183
Gun!

185
00:21:01,108 --> 00:21:02,818
Rog, meet your new partner.

186
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:09,282
I'm too old for this shit.

187
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:16,040
There are those who say you're a good cop.

188
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,668
I try.

189
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:22,381
I heard about the little stunt yesterday.
Pretty heroic.

190
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:26,301
I pulled your file.

191
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:30,389
Said you worked in the Phoenix
project in Vietnam. That right?

192
00:21:30,597 --> 00:21:33,559
Assassination stuff.
It's over, you know.

193
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,352
What is?

194
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,062
The war.

195
00:21:37,313 --> 00:21:38,898
Yes, I know.

196
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:40,900
Just thought I'd remind you.

197
00:21:43,028 --> 00:21:45,364
That's some serious shit you carry.

198
00:21:46,824 --> 00:21:48,492
Be my guest.

199
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,084
9mm Beretta. Takes 15 in the mag,
one up the pipe...

200
00:21:57,418 --> 00:22:01,006
...wide ejection port, no feed jams.

201
00:22:01,423 --> 00:22:02,507
What have you got?

202
00:22:02,758 --> 00:22:03,884
Four- inch Smith.

203
00:22:05,427 --> 00:22:06,511
Six- shooter?

204
00:22:08,096 --> 00:22:09,681
A lot of old- timers carry those.

205
00:22:14,062 --> 00:22:16,689
File also said you're heavy
into martial arts.

206
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:20,319
Tai chi and all that killer stuff.

207
00:22:20,652 --> 00:22:23,947
I suppose we have to register you
as a lethal weapon.

208
00:22:24,782 --> 00:22:28,660
Let's just cut the shit.
We both know why I was transferred.

209
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:33,207
Everybody thinks I'm suicidal,
so nobody wants to work with me.

210
00:22:33,457 --> 00:22:35,918
Some think I'm faking
to draw psycho pension...

211
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:40,131
...so nobody wants to work with me.
Basically, I'm fucked.

212
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,383
Guess what?

213
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,259
I don't want to work with you.

214
00:22:43,468 --> 00:22:44,344
Then don't.

215
00:22:44,636 --> 00:22:48,724
Ain't got no choice.
Looks like we both got fucked.

216
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:49,892
Terrific.

217
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:55,856
God hates me, is what it is.

218
00:22:56,982 --> 00:22:59,193
Hate Him back. It works for me.

219
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:19,757
- Good afternoon, Mr. Mendez.
- How you doing?

220
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:21,259
Did you pat him down?

221
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:24,179
- We went through this already.
- Go through it again.

222
00:23:24,513 --> 00:23:25,681
Who are you?

223
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:29,017
That's hardly important,
but you may call me Mr. Joshua.

224
00:23:29,268 --> 00:23:30,310
Let's go.

225
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,855
Great, swell. Mr. Joshua, huh?

226
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:39,528
General, Mr. Mendez is here.

227
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:47,036
You call this music? I can get
a better band for half the price.

228
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:51,041
I don't want to hear any of this shit.
Let's get it right.

229
00:23:53,294 --> 00:23:55,379
Mr. Mendez, how are you?

230
00:23:55,796 --> 00:23:56,922
I'm fine.

231
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:00,051
Where did you get him?
Psychos "R" Us?

232
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:01,635
I don't think you're funny.

233
00:24:01,886 --> 00:24:04,598
I don't think this whole
goddamn setup is funny.

234
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,559
You're using mercenaries.
Tell me I'm wrong!

235
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:09,144
You're not wrong.

236
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:11,855
And you expect me to trust these bozos?

237
00:24:12,105 --> 00:24:14,399
My people are loyal to me.

238
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:16,234
Bullshit.

239
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,736
Do you smoke?

240
00:24:17,986 --> 00:24:19,989
What does that have to do with it?

241
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:21,115
Do you smoke?!

242
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:24,660
Give me your lighter.

243
00:24:25,204 --> 00:24:26,914
- My lighter?
- Your lighter!

244
00:24:27,414 --> 00:24:28,665
Okay. Right here.

245
00:24:29,374 --> 00:24:30,459
Here. Take it.

246
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:33,420
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?

247
00:24:33,754 --> 00:24:35,005
Shut your mouth!

248
00:24:35,297 --> 00:24:36,632
Shut up!

249
00:24:37,091 --> 00:24:38,425
And don't move.

250
00:24:42,596 --> 00:24:45,140
Mr. Joshua, your left arm, please.

251
00:24:53,943 --> 00:24:58,114
Hey, you guys are fucking gone.
You know what I am saying?

252
00:24:58,447 --> 00:25:00,449
Jesus Christ, man!

253
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,787
You guys are fucking crazy, man. Come on!

254
00:25:09,543 --> 00:25:11,670
Have Endo look at that, Mr. Joshua.

255
00:25:13,755 --> 00:25:15,006
Yes, sir.

256
00:25:16,508 --> 00:25:18,635
You wish to do business with us, yes?

257
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:20,053
Jesus Christ!

258
00:25:20,303 --> 00:25:22,682
You wish to make a purchase, yes?

259
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:26,185
Yes, yes! Jesus Christ, yes.

260
00:25:28,564 --> 00:25:32,025
You guys are out there like
fucking Pluto, man. You're gone!

261
00:25:32,317 --> 00:25:36,447
The heroin will be here Friday night.
We'll make delivery at that time.

262
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:38,866
Have the money ready, and no tricks.

263
00:25:39,158 --> 00:25:42,453
If you try anything,
you'll have to talk to Mr. Joshua.

264
00:25:43,662 --> 00:25:45,998
Right. Joshua. I got you.

265
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:48,500
Merry Christmas.

266
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:51,671
Yeah, right. You too, pal.

267
00:26:03,434 --> 00:26:04,685
Mike...

268
00:26:05,853 --> 00:26:10,650
...the autopsy report showed
that Amanda was poisoned.

269
00:26:11,568 --> 00:26:13,945
Even if she hadn't jumped,
she'd still be dead.

270
00:26:15,697 --> 00:26:18,366
She was murdered.

271
00:26:22,788 --> 00:26:24,206
Jesus!

272
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:31,590
I can't take this.
I just can't take this.

273
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,721
Why did you try
to get in touch with me?

274
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,560
I heard that you were...

275
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,731
Somebody told me you were
working out here.

276
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,070
I thought you could get her out.

277
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:54,030
Get her out of what?

278
00:26:56,951 --> 00:27:01,580
Get her out of the stuff she was into.
She was making...

279
00:27:02,164 --> 00:27:03,582
...videotapes.

280
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:06,752
Pornographic...

281
00:27:08,087 --> 00:27:10,047
...videotapes.

282
00:27:10,423 --> 00:27:14,469
I thought maybe you could just
get her out. Help her.

283
00:27:28,276 --> 00:27:29,610
Easy, Mike.

284
00:27:36,577 --> 00:27:38,328
You owe me, Roger.

285
00:27:39,496 --> 00:27:40,497
Remember?

286
00:27:47,921 --> 00:27:49,173
I remember.

287
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:53,302
I want you to find whoever's
responsible for this...

288
00:27:54,471 --> 00:27:56,806
...however many of them there are.

289
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:03,355
I know you can do it.
Just find them and kill them.

290
00:28:03,689 --> 00:28:05,107
I'm a police officer.

291
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:08,319
I don't give a shit
that you're a police officer!

292
00:28:08,736 --> 00:28:10,780
Kill them! Just kill them!

293
00:28:11,697 --> 00:28:13,491
Wait. Wait, Rog.

294
00:28:13,699 --> 00:28:16,161
Come on. You find them and you kill them.

295
00:28:16,453 --> 00:28:19,539
You can do that. You owe me.

296
00:28:23,585 --> 00:28:24,920
I owe you.

297
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:28,715
Gotta go, man.

298
00:28:36,266 --> 00:28:38,977
What did he mean when he said you owed him?

299
00:28:39,228 --> 00:28:41,563
We served together in 1965.

300
00:28:41,939 --> 00:28:45,651
Ia Drang Valley. Saved my life.
Took a bayonet in the lungs.

301
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:48,570
- That was nice of him.
- I thought so.

302
00:28:48,904 --> 00:28:51,907
- Want me to drive?
- You're supposed to be suicidal.

303
00:28:52,282 --> 00:28:54,910
Anybody who drives
in this town is suicidal.

304
00:28:55,244 --> 00:28:59,249
All units, possible jumper
at Santa Monica and Orlando.

305
00:28:59,624 --> 00:29:01,960
7- A- 21, handle code two.

306
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:06,715
- All units, come in, please.
- Gotcha!

307
00:29:07,174 --> 00:29:09,593
- What's the number of the car?
- 3- William- 56.

308
00:29:09,844 --> 00:29:13,806
3- William- 56 en route.
I love this job! It's so exciting!

309
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:16,725
Copy.
Police psychologist on the way.

310
00:29:18,311 --> 00:29:20,772
Hey, boss, can we put the sirens on?

311
00:29:35,455 --> 00:29:37,165
Guys, I'm glad you're here.

312
00:29:37,415 --> 00:29:39,835
- Where's the psychologist?
- Stuck in traffic.

313
00:29:40,085 --> 00:29:40,961
Who's this guy?

314
00:29:41,336 --> 00:29:45,632
Name's McCleary. He was at an
office party and just went outside.

315
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:48,802
- You think he'll go?
- Seems serious enough. Who knows?

316
00:29:49,928 --> 00:29:51,930
- I can handle this.
- Are you qualified?

317
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:54,308
- I've done it before.
- You're elected.

318
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:58,228
- No guns, just bring him down.
- Roger.

319
00:29:58,812 --> 00:30:00,148
10- 4.

320
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:18,959
- Who are you?
- Riggs, homicide.

321
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,046
He's over there on the ledge.

322
00:30:32,432 --> 00:30:33,850
Merry Christmas.

323
00:30:34,726 --> 00:30:36,854
Leave me alone!

324
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:38,231
What are you doing?

325
00:30:38,648 --> 00:30:40,066
None of your damn business!

326
00:30:40,817 --> 00:30:42,444
Fair enough.

327
00:30:43,028 --> 00:30:45,781
I'm just going to come out there, okay?

328
00:30:45,989 --> 00:30:48,534
Don't!
You touch me, I'm gonna jump!

329
00:30:50,202 --> 00:30:52,246
Take it easy, for chrissake!

330
00:30:52,538 --> 00:30:54,832
I don't like this any better than you do.

331
00:30:55,624 --> 00:30:57,418
I can't stand heights.

332
00:30:57,668 --> 00:30:58,919
This makes me dizzy.

333
00:30:59,128 --> 00:31:01,588
Just give me a chance to talk to you.

334
00:31:04,342 --> 00:31:06,469
I'm gonna stand on the ledge with you.

335
00:31:06,845 --> 00:31:09,265
Don't go. Not out on the ledge.

336
00:31:10,224 --> 00:31:13,561
You're not the first guy
to think of this, you know.

337
00:31:13,894 --> 00:31:16,730
A lot of people got problems
during this season.

338
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,234
- You know shit!
- No, you're wrong, pal.

339
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:22,903
You know nothing! Don't touch me!

340
00:31:23,237 --> 00:31:24,781
I didn't do anything wrong!

341
00:31:25,073 --> 00:31:27,993
I know that. It's not like
you're murdering anyone.

342
00:31:28,243 --> 00:31:30,120
- That's right!
- That's right.

343
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,123
The only one I hurt is me! Me!

344
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:35,959
That's right. I know
you're hurting. I get it.

345
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:38,754
Don't come near me!

346
00:31:39,045 --> 00:31:41,424
Give me a break.
My boss is watching me.

347
00:31:41,674 --> 00:31:44,385
I got to make it look
like I'm trying to save you.

348
00:31:45,387 --> 00:31:46,221
Come on.

349
00:31:47,848 --> 00:31:51,268
I'm just gonna stand here
and talk to you. That's all.

350
00:31:51,935 --> 00:31:54,396
You won't try nothing?

351
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,899
I'm square with you.
I won't try a thing.

352
00:31:57,357 --> 00:32:01,236
You think I want to fall off?
I promise, I'll just talk to you.

353
00:32:02,696 --> 00:32:03,947
All right.

354
00:32:04,364 --> 00:32:07,911
Here, you want a cigarette?
Come on, let's smoke, okay?

355
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,413
Go on, take it.

356
00:32:10,706 --> 00:32:13,042
Take our time and both die of cancer.

357
00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:30,644
See this key?

358
00:32:31,228 --> 00:32:32,395
Bye- bye!

359
00:32:32,979 --> 00:32:34,022
You're crazy!

360
00:32:34,272 --> 00:32:38,235
You can jump, but you'd take me
with you, making you a murderer.

361
00:32:38,485 --> 00:32:40,654
- You bastard!
- You'd be killing a cop.

362
00:32:40,904 --> 00:32:42,448
Yeah, a psycho nut cop!

363
00:32:42,698 --> 00:32:44,826
I'm still a cop.
You coming in?

364
00:32:45,076 --> 00:32:47,704
- I'm jumping!
- Do you really wanna jump?

365
00:32:47,913 --> 00:32:51,291
Do you wanna?
That's fine with me. Come on!

366
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:53,252
Let's do it, asshole.

367
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,087
I want to do it.

368
00:33:07,975 --> 00:33:09,269
Shit!

369
00:33:16,735 --> 00:33:18,320
You want to go up again?

370
00:33:18,571 --> 00:33:20,281
Come on, it was great.

371
00:33:22,616 --> 00:33:24,952
Help me! Help me loose!

372
00:33:25,494 --> 00:33:27,121
He's trying to kill me!

373
00:33:27,496 --> 00:33:30,834
Did you see that?
He's out of his mind! He's crazy!

374
00:33:31,126 --> 00:33:33,295
I want my cuffs back.

375
00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:36,631
- Don't you touch me!
- What the fuck did you just do?

376
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:40,135
I controlled the jump!
You wanted him down? He's down!

377
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,511
Come here!

378
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,513
Come here with me!

379
00:33:54,777 --> 00:33:56,570
Get in here!

380
00:34:00,365 --> 00:34:04,328
Okay, no bullshit!
You want to kill yourself?

381
00:34:04,578 --> 00:34:06,747
Shut up! Yes or no?
You want to die?

382
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:09,208
I got the job done!

383
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:11,377
Just answer the question!

384
00:34:11,586 --> 00:34:13,505
What do you want to hear, man?

385
00:34:13,713 --> 00:34:16,342
That sometimes I think about
eating a bullet?

386
00:34:17,676 --> 00:34:18,886
Well, I do!

387
00:34:19,178 --> 00:34:22,348
I got a special one for the occasion,
with a hollow point.

388
00:34:22,723 --> 00:34:26,060
Make sure it blows
the back of my goddamn head out!

389
00:34:26,477 --> 00:34:29,563
Every day I wake up and think
of a reason not to do it.

390
00:34:29,814 --> 00:34:32,024
Every single day.

391
00:34:32,734 --> 00:34:36,029
And you know why I don't?
This is gonna make you laugh.

392
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:39,366
The job. Doing the job.
That's the reason.

393
00:34:39,908 --> 00:34:43,286
- You want to die!
- I don't. I'm not afraid of it.

394
00:34:43,787 --> 00:34:47,624
Here, take my gun. Don't nibble
on the barrel, pull the trigger.

395
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:50,253
Be my guest!
Go ahead, if you're serious!

396
00:34:50,628 --> 00:34:52,338
You shouldn't tempt me.

397
00:34:53,173 --> 00:34:57,094
In your mouth. Bullet may go
through your ear and not kill you.

398
00:34:57,344 --> 00:34:59,346
Under the chin's just as good!

399
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,410
You're not trying to draw a psycho pension.

400
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,122
You really are crazy.

401
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:31,714
I'm hungry. I'm gonna go
and get something to eat.

402
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:47,647
I don 't know. He's hurting. There's
something eating away at this guy.

403
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:52,278
I think he's on the edge.
I think Riggs has a death wish.

404
00:35:52,779 --> 00:35:56,450
Terrific. So you're saying I should worry?

405
00:35:57,785 --> 00:35:59,453
I think you should worry.

406
00:35:59,661 --> 00:36:01,997
When he goes,
you don't want to be near him.

407
00:36:02,206 --> 00:36:05,083
Thank you, doctor.
You've been very helpful.

408
00:36:05,501 --> 00:36:06,919
You're welcome.

409
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:14,218
I'm too old for this shit.

410
00:36:16,971 --> 00:36:18,139
You hungry?

411
00:36:18,431 --> 00:36:20,141
No! I'm not hungry.

412
00:36:20,683 --> 00:36:23,145
- Want me to drive?
- No! I'll drive!

413
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:24,563
Get in that side!

414
00:36:24,814 --> 00:36:26,107
You drive.

415
00:36:33,197 --> 00:36:37,786
You get a bad personal call? What
is it? Did the stock market crash?

416
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:40,705
Don't worry. Here, have a French fry.

417
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:51,341
Fifty years old. What a birthday.
Fifty years old!

418
00:36:51,675 --> 00:36:56,389
Been on the force 20 years, not
a scratch on me. Got a wife, kids...

419
00:36:56,848 --> 00:37:01,728
...house, boat. I can kiss it all
goodbye because of your death wish.

420
00:37:01,937 --> 00:37:02,980
My life is over.

421
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:04,857
Would you just shut up here!

422
00:37:05,065 --> 00:37:08,026
Why are you talking to me anyway?
I'm a dead man!

423
00:37:09,736 --> 00:37:13,449
I was driving before you were
an itch in your daddy's pants.

424
00:37:18,078 --> 00:37:19,789
- I didn't know that.
- Know what?

425
00:37:19,998 --> 00:37:22,125
That it was your birthday today.

426
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:24,879
It was yesterday.

427
00:37:25,379 --> 00:37:28,257
Well, happy birthday for yesterday.

428
00:37:31,427 --> 00:37:33,554
Sincerely. Happy birthday, man.

429
00:37:33,762 --> 00:37:34,889
Thanks.

430
00:37:37,558 --> 00:37:41,396
Maybe we'll stay alive long enough
for me to buy you a present.

431
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,400
Don't thank me now.

432
00:37:45,734 --> 00:37:49,738
It's the least I can do after
all the kindness you've shown me.

433
00:38:02,336 --> 00:38:04,963
Are you gonna tell me where we're going?

434
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,174
Are we together on this?

435
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,679
Beverly Hills. We got an address
on Amanda Hunsaker's meal ticket.

436
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:15,349
Remember, he's not a suspect yet.

437
00:38:15,682 --> 00:38:18,101
So we question him, not damage him.

438
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,854
I won't hurt. You do all the talking.

439
00:38:21,104 --> 00:38:22,524
Let me do all the talking.

440
00:38:22,774 --> 00:38:24,734
Experience counts here.

441
00:38:27,445 --> 00:38:30,449
- You're not going to smoke in the car.
- Well, I am.

442
00:38:32,034 --> 00:38:33,786
What? Does this bother you?

443
00:38:34,161 --> 00:38:35,037
It bothers me.

444
00:38:35,287 --> 00:38:36,872
- Does it?
- Yeah.

445
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,126
I'll open a window.

446
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:45,423
That's not the point. I have to watch
out for my lungs, take care of myself.

447
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:48,385
4241 coming up.

448
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:50,011
Bingo.

449
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:55,225
- Do we have a warrant?
- We don't need one with the gate club.

450
00:38:55,684 --> 00:38:57,727
Didn't take them long, huh?

451
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:04,570
Hey, guys, go on in!
Make yourselves at home!

452
00:39:04,945 --> 00:39:06,238
Merry Christmas!

453
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,076
Don't need a warrant with an invitation.

454
00:39:12,828 --> 00:39:16,290
I saw this place on
"Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless. "

455
00:39:26,176 --> 00:39:27,594
Get the door.

456
00:39:39,523 --> 00:39:41,525
Nice and easy.

457
00:39:44,361 --> 00:39:47,657
- Looks like the Garden of Eden.
- Look at this!

458
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,452
Paradise.

459
00:39:53,705 --> 00:39:55,415
Isn't that sweet?

460
00:39:55,624 --> 00:39:58,001
I'm thinking probable cause.

461
00:40:10,516 --> 00:40:12,142
Get the girls!

462
00:40:13,435 --> 00:40:14,895
Okay, asshole!

463
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,231
Move! Come on! Get out!

464
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,274
Fast! Move!

465
00:40:20,567 --> 00:40:23,320
Get your hands on that tree
and face each other!

466
00:40:23,737 --> 00:40:25,197
Hands in front of you!

467
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:28,535
- My leg...
- Don't move it, or I'll break your arm.

468
00:40:29,744 --> 00:40:30,620
Got them!

469
00:40:33,874 --> 00:40:35,417
Show me your hands!

470
00:40:35,793 --> 00:40:37,253
Right now!

471
00:40:37,878 --> 00:40:39,713
Put your hands out there!

472
00:40:44,635 --> 00:40:45,928
See how easy that was?

473
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:49,683
Boom! Still alive.
Now we question him. You know why?

474
00:40:50,016 --> 00:40:53,311
Because I didn't shoot him
or jump off a building with him.

475
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,980
The building guy lived.

476
00:40:55,188 --> 00:40:56,857
The point being, no killing.

477
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:59,276
- No killing, right.
- Right.

478
00:40:59,484 --> 00:41:01,528
Piece of cake. Now I'm happy.

479
00:41:01,778 --> 00:41:04,447
Read him his rights.
I'll stand here being happy.

480
00:41:06,993 --> 00:41:08,077
He's got a gun!

481
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:54,503
You ever met anybody you didn't kill?

482
00:41:57,672 --> 00:42:00,008
Well, I haven't killed you yet.

483
00:42:02,385 --> 00:42:04,012
Don't do me no favors.

484
00:42:04,387 --> 00:42:05,931
Don't you worry.

485
00:42:17,903 --> 00:42:21,615
The coroner gave the body a ride downtown.

486
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,702
I guess we can get out of here.

487
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:33,210
I'm sorry about that shit
I said out there.

488
00:42:35,213 --> 00:42:37,882
You saved my life. Thank you.

489
00:42:44,223 --> 00:42:45,683
I bet that hurt to say.

490
00:42:48,227 --> 00:42:49,478
You'll never know.

491
00:42:51,564 --> 00:42:53,023
Let's get a bite to eat.

492
00:42:53,274 --> 00:42:54,609
Get my shoes on.

493
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:08,331
- Mom, Rog is coming.
- Okay, Carrie.

494
00:43:17,468 --> 00:43:21,513
Here's my welcoming committee!
Where's my daughter? Which one...?

495
00:43:21,722 --> 00:43:25,100
- Come on, Daddy.
- This one's my daughter!

496
00:43:25,976 --> 00:43:28,270
Home, both of you. Dinnertime.

497
00:43:28,937 --> 00:43:30,272
How are you doing?

498
00:43:30,606 --> 00:43:32,149
I am doing all right.

499
00:43:32,441 --> 00:43:34,151
Is that a crook?

500
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:37,155
No, this is my new partner, Martin.

501
00:43:41,034 --> 00:43:43,287
I'm glad you're home at a sensible hour.

502
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,290
Well, I try to be a sensible dad.

503
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,292
Come on in, Martin.

504
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,128
Yeah, close the door.

505
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:55,674
Hello, Nick. Get your legs
off the arm of the couch.

506
00:43:57,427 --> 00:44:01,348
How you doing? Is Mommy
in the kitchen? Let's sneak up on her.

507
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:09,523
Hello, baby!
I want you to meet...

508
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:12,609
I'd like you to meet Daddy's new partner.

509
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:14,445
- Martin Riggs.
- How are you?

510
00:44:14,695 --> 00:44:17,657
- This is my wife, Trish.
- Pleased to meet you.

511
00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:20,077
Martin's going to join us for dinner.

512
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:22,996
- Roast okay with you?
- What's for dinner?

513
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:25,999
We'll see what's for dinner.

514
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:29,670
This is a brown, sticky...

515
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,547
It's roast.

516
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,258
How about a brown, roast- like substance?

517
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:37,344
- Roger, you're being an asshole.
- I try not to be.

518
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:39,430
- Want a drink?
- What do you got?

519
00:44:39,639 --> 00:44:41,724
We have Canadian Mist...

520
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:46,147
- You like Canadian Mist?
- Honey, it's in the back.

521
00:44:48,357 --> 00:44:51,694
How come we didn't have fish?
I thought we had fish tonight.

522
00:44:52,027 --> 00:44:53,612
Don't worry about the fish.

523
00:44:53,863 --> 00:44:55,865
Getting defensive...
Ever go fishing?

524
00:44:56,157 --> 00:44:59,118
Not since I was a kid.
I used to go spearfishing.

525
00:45:01,037 --> 00:45:02,414
All I caught was a cold.

526
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:06,501
I got that boat out there.

527
00:45:06,835 --> 00:45:08,837
Rianne, get the dessert.

528
00:45:09,212 --> 00:45:12,424
Rianne! Your mother said get the dessert.

529
00:45:12,632 --> 00:45:14,968
- Get the dessert. Get to it!
- Shut up.

530
00:45:16,053 --> 00:45:20,558
Catalina Island. Nothing exciting,
but I catch my allotment.

531
00:45:20,933 --> 00:45:25,314
You can catch a few things out there.
I caught my wife out there.

532
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:28,484
Nice fishing out there.

533
00:45:28,775 --> 00:45:30,235
Mr. Riggs, care for a tart?

534
00:45:30,777 --> 00:45:32,446
Thank you, yes. Call me Martin.

535
00:45:34,281 --> 00:45:35,949
Mr. Riggs.

536
00:45:36,283 --> 00:45:37,576
Sit down.

537
00:45:38,827 --> 00:45:41,538
Rianne, it's not the first time
we've had company.

538
00:45:47,253 --> 00:45:51,091
My name is Carrie,
I'm no fairy
My sister's cherry

539
00:45:51,425 --> 00:45:53,761
She's in love with a guy named Martin...

540
00:45:55,137 --> 00:45:56,138
Nicholas!

541
00:45:56,347 --> 00:45:58,933
Come on. It was really good!

542
00:45:59,308 --> 00:46:01,602
Yeah, Dad! Why don't you try it?

543
00:46:02,144 --> 00:46:03,063
It was good.

544
00:46:05,649 --> 00:46:07,192
Yeah, there you go.

545
00:46:07,442 --> 00:46:09,903
I'm gonna find a partner
My name is Roger

546
00:46:10,278 --> 00:46:13,865
And I need to be modger
And a secret hodger

547
00:46:14,658 --> 00:46:16,076
You need some help.

548
00:46:16,368 --> 00:46:17,786
I am awful!

549
00:46:31,969 --> 00:46:35,681
Hey, sarge! Thanks for
taking out the garbage.

550
00:46:36,306 --> 00:46:39,142
But, honey, I'm entertaining our guest.

551
00:46:42,771 --> 00:46:44,148
What do you think?

552
00:46:44,857 --> 00:46:47,610
It's nice. You know
anything about boats?

553
00:46:47,861 --> 00:46:50,531
- I know what they cost.
- Can you sail this?

554
00:46:51,073 --> 00:46:53,784
What's wrong with you?
It's not a sailboat.

555
00:46:54,535 --> 00:46:55,828
That's what I thought.

556
00:46:56,162 --> 00:47:01,000
There's no trick. That's the front,
that's the back, water all around.

557
00:47:01,292 --> 00:47:03,961
Why you gotta make things
so complicated?

558
00:47:08,008 --> 00:47:11,803
I don't. Things get complicated
all by themselves.

559
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,472
You mean
Amanda Hunsaker's murder, huh?

560
00:47:14,764 --> 00:47:16,725
Did I mention that? I didn't.

561
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:19,853
Didn't have to.
I can read your mind.

562
00:47:21,731 --> 00:47:23,858
What's the matter with you?

563
00:47:24,525 --> 00:47:26,777
- Why is there a problem?
- There's no problem.

564
00:47:26,987 --> 00:47:29,198
You got one dead girl
and one dead guy.

565
00:47:29,448 --> 00:47:33,869
The guy kills the girl. We kill him
because he wants us to be dead guys.

566
00:47:34,286 --> 00:47:35,996
That's easy for you to say.

567
00:47:37,372 --> 00:47:39,291
A sugar daddy is dealing drugs.

568
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:43,045
She said, did or saw something
she wasn't supposed to.

569
00:47:43,253 --> 00:47:46,548
He pitches her off the balcony
into the sweet by- and- by.

570
00:47:47,633 --> 00:47:49,928
That's why he came at us
with a shotgun today.

571
00:47:50,136 --> 00:47:54,225
I'm sorry. It's just a little too neat.
I can't swallow it.

572
00:47:54,558 --> 00:47:58,521
Of course it's neat.
What's wrong with neat? I like neat.

573
00:47:59,897 --> 00:48:02,274
By neat, you mean simple.

574
00:48:04,902 --> 00:48:06,570
- You okay?
- Watch out!

575
00:48:07,238 --> 00:48:08,740
What button did you push?

576
00:48:09,908 --> 00:48:11,618
Where's my manual?

577
00:48:13,078 --> 00:48:15,372
Is this what you're looking for, captain?

578
00:48:15,622 --> 00:48:16,915
You asshole!

579
00:48:17,749 --> 00:48:21,586
Didn't mean to interrupt one of those
intellectual conversations...

580
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,715
Mark asked me to a club tomorrow night.

581
00:48:25,007 --> 00:48:28,094
- You're grounded. You know that.
- Please, Daddy?

582
00:48:28,302 --> 00:48:29,428
Which one is Mark?

583
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,057
- The blond one.
- With pits in his face?

584
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:33,976
Those are dimples.

585
00:48:34,184 --> 00:48:38,188
Pits. When he smiles, I can see
through his head. The answer is no.

586
00:48:38,772 --> 00:48:39,982
Have a heart, Rog.

587
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:43,735
Hey, buddy. She smoked pot
in the house. She's grounded.

588
00:48:43,944 --> 00:48:47,698
Why can I have a beer
and I can't smoke a joint?

589
00:48:47,906 --> 00:48:49,199
It's not coke, you know.

590
00:48:49,408 --> 00:48:53,288
I'll tell you why.
Because now, at this moment...

591
00:48:53,621 --> 00:48:56,792
...beer is legal, grass ain't.
Right or wrong?

592
00:48:57,209 --> 00:48:58,043
It's wrong.

593
00:48:58,419 --> 00:48:59,253
Right.

594
00:49:05,384 --> 00:49:08,220
They sit there drinking six- packs
and I get grounded.

595
00:49:09,763 --> 00:49:11,432
I'm gonna go home.

596
00:49:12,142 --> 00:49:14,561
Did we resolve anything here tonight?

597
00:49:14,769 --> 00:49:16,688
Yeah, we resolved plenty.

598
00:49:17,856 --> 00:49:20,275
We know your wife takes out the garbage...

599
00:49:20,609 --> 00:49:23,278
...your daughter smokes grass
and it's illegal...

600
00:49:24,654 --> 00:49:27,491
...and you don't know a lot about boats.

601
00:49:31,871 --> 00:49:34,291
You got a hell of a nice family there.

602
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:35,626
Thank you.

603
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,504
I enjoyed the meal. Thanks a lot.

604
00:49:38,712 --> 00:49:42,007
Bullshit. But thanks anyway.

605
00:49:48,305 --> 00:49:50,140
You don't trust me at all, do you?

606
00:49:51,558 --> 00:49:56,356
I tell you what. You make it through
tomorrow without killing anybody...

607
00:49:56,564 --> 00:50:00,528
...especially me or yourself,
then I'll start trusting you.

608
00:50:02,821 --> 00:50:04,198
Fair enough.

609
00:50:09,328 --> 00:50:10,788
I do it real good, you know.

610
00:50:11,455 --> 00:50:12,331
Do what?

611
00:50:15,669 --> 00:50:19,881
When I was 19, I did a guy
in Laos from 1000 yards out.

612
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,551
A rifle shot in high wind.

613
00:50:25,011 --> 00:50:26,513
Maybe eight...

614
00:50:27,055 --> 00:50:30,226
...or even ten guys in the world
could have made that shot.

615
00:50:34,772 --> 00:50:37,359
It's the only thing I was ever good at.

616
00:50:39,945 --> 00:50:41,071
See you tomorrow.

617
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:44,658
Yeah, see you.

618
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:53,625
You really like my wife's cooking?

619
00:51:00,216 --> 00:51:01,217
No.

620
00:51:02,386 --> 00:51:03,637
See you tomorrow.

621
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,082
Get out of there, Burbank.

622
00:51:50,729 --> 00:51:52,648
This is cute.

623
00:51:56,443 --> 00:51:59,113
What have we got here?
"Police evidence. "

624
00:53:37,093 --> 00:53:39,722
Morning, Roger.
Here, have some coffee.

625
00:53:40,264 --> 00:53:45,062
I've been doing a lot of thinking
about the night Amanda Hunsaker died.

626
00:53:45,395 --> 00:53:47,231
- How did you get in?
- Trish let me in.

627
00:53:47,481 --> 00:53:49,441
- What time is it?
- Daytime.

628
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,569
The night Amanda Hunsaker died, she...

629
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:56,073
What was the name of that hooker
who witnessed the jump?

630
00:53:56,281 --> 00:53:59,785
Come on, we got to get up
and catch bad guys today.

631
00:54:00,077 --> 00:54:01,578
I'll get a shower.

632
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:04,624
What was the name of that hooker?

633
00:54:04,832 --> 00:54:08,211
- Century City isn't her usual turf.
- Her name is Dixie!

634
00:54:08,419 --> 00:54:12,258
Give me that cup.
And get out of here!

635
00:54:16,595 --> 00:54:19,640
Someone was in bed with Amanda
the night she died.

636
00:54:19,932 --> 00:54:22,101
Until now, we assumed it was a man.

637
00:54:22,434 --> 00:54:24,103
Suppose it was Dixie.

638
00:54:24,353 --> 00:54:28,567
Disgusting, but okay. Let's say Dixie
put the drain cleaner in her pills.

639
00:54:28,775 --> 00:54:30,277
Say someone paid her.

640
00:54:30,485 --> 00:54:35,365
She thinks, "Amanda swallows a couple
downers and she's dead". Then Dixie...

641
00:54:35,824 --> 00:54:36,658
If it was her.

642
00:54:37,075 --> 00:54:42,206
If it was her. She's got plenty of time
to spritz the place up and get out.

643
00:54:42,415 --> 00:54:44,458
But Amanda jumps out the window.

644
00:54:44,792 --> 00:54:46,670
Or Dixie pushes her.

645
00:54:46,879 --> 00:54:49,840
She has to make a quick exit
because the body's public.

646
00:54:50,048 --> 00:54:51,592
So she hauls ass downstairs.

647
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,802
People are saying, "What happened?"

648
00:54:54,052 --> 00:54:56,430
Somebody spots her,
and she says, "Shit!"

649
00:54:56,805 --> 00:54:58,932
That's right, she says, "Shit!"

650
00:54:59,182 --> 00:55:02,186
The point being that now
she has to cover her ass.

651
00:55:04,146 --> 00:55:08,818
So she grabs a flatfoot and says,
"Officer, I saw the whole thing".

652
00:55:10,153 --> 00:55:11,487
Right.

653
00:55:15,326 --> 00:55:16,952
That's pretty fucking thin.

654
00:55:17,161 --> 00:55:18,412
That's very thin.

655
00:55:18,746 --> 00:55:20,414
Thin's my middle name.

656
00:55:20,664 --> 00:55:23,083
Your wife's cooking, I'm not surprised.

657
00:55:24,501 --> 00:55:26,086
- What?
- Nothing.

658
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:29,174
Those remarks won't get you
invited to Christmas dinner.

659
00:55:30,258 --> 00:55:32,969
My luck's changing for the better every day.

660
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,682
All right, baby, come to Roger.

661
00:55:40,018 --> 00:55:41,519
Center mass.

662
00:55:47,693 --> 00:55:49,571
Read them and weep.

663
00:55:52,866 --> 00:55:55,077
Do you sleep with that thing?

664
00:55:55,577 --> 00:55:57,120
I would if I slept.

665
00:55:57,454 --> 00:56:00,624
Step back. Let me show
what an old man can do.

666
00:56:01,542 --> 00:56:03,752
Just warming up,
just warming up.

667
00:56:11,386 --> 00:56:12,971
Watch carefully.

668
00:56:26,569 --> 00:56:30,072
Hey! Look at that, will you?
Not bad for an old man.

669
00:56:30,573 --> 00:56:32,742
Step aside, old man.

670
00:57:28,928 --> 00:57:30,721
Have a nice day.

671
00:57:36,436 --> 00:57:37,854
Shit!

672
00:57:41,441 --> 00:57:44,110
Uh- oh! The policemen are here!

673
00:57:44,778 --> 00:57:48,114
Yeah, you're right.
Hello, policemen!

674
00:57:53,287 --> 00:57:55,207
- How you doing?
- Fine.

675
00:57:55,415 --> 00:57:58,085
Are you going to bust Dixie?

676
00:57:58,335 --> 00:58:01,129
We're just going over there
for a cup of coffee.

677
00:58:01,338 --> 00:58:03,507
We're going over here to have breakfast.

678
00:58:03,757 --> 00:58:06,009
You're gonna bust Dixie!

679
00:58:06,218 --> 00:58:08,720
You're gonna bust Dixie!

680
00:58:14,101 --> 00:58:17,272
- Like I said, thin.
- Probably nothing.

681
00:58:30,244 --> 00:58:32,663
Did you see that? Wasn't that great?

682
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:37,836
What are you, a fag?

683
00:58:38,044 --> 00:58:39,754
Your coat's on fire!

684
00:58:44,134 --> 00:58:47,470
- Probably nothing.
- Thin. Very thin.

685
00:58:49,681 --> 00:58:52,475
You guys okay?
Got all your fingers and toes?

686
00:58:52,727 --> 00:58:54,854
Three William 56.

687
00:58:55,146 --> 00:58:58,066
We got a fire and explosion
at 111th and Larch.

688
00:58:58,358 --> 00:59:01,236
Request ambulance and fire department.

689
00:59:01,695 --> 00:59:04,031
Do it again! Do it again!

690
00:59:04,364 --> 00:59:07,242
- Give me a break, guys.
- Enough, enough!

691
00:59:07,534 --> 00:59:09,786
Do you think Dixie was home?

692
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,217
What you got?

693
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:24,803
Part of the device.

694
00:59:25,095 --> 00:59:27,556
This is artwork.
This is goddamn artwork.

695
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:32,895
This is real pro stuff. I haven't seen
anything like this since the war.

696
00:59:34,355 --> 00:59:37,733
The CIA used to hire mercs.
They used the exact same setup.

697
00:59:37,983 --> 00:59:40,904
Mercury switches, gaflooey!
That's heavy shit.

698
00:59:42,489 --> 00:59:45,450
We got something.
The detective wants to see you.

699
00:59:55,628 --> 00:59:56,712
Okay, here it is.

700
00:59:56,963 --> 00:59:58,714
Some kids playing this morning...

701
00:59:58,923 --> 01:00:01,051
...one saw a guy checking the meter.

702
01:00:01,301 --> 01:00:03,428
- Where?
- Here at Dixie's.

703
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:08,016
He was playing under the porch.
Says he saw the guy pretty good.

704
01:00:08,267 --> 01:00:11,728
- It could be a break.
- Those kids are six years old.

705
01:00:11,937 --> 01:00:14,439
- You call the gas company?
- Sure did.

706
01:00:14,773 --> 01:00:18,402
No one's supposed to check
that meter for at least a month.

707
01:00:19,778 --> 01:00:22,824
- Let me handle this.
- Be my guest.

708
01:00:23,032 --> 01:00:25,493
He's the little fellow that saw the guy.

709
01:00:26,494 --> 01:00:29,498
My name is Detective Murtaugh.
What's yours?

710
01:00:29,707 --> 01:00:33,043
- Don't tell him your name.
- He'll put you in jail.

711
01:00:33,294 --> 01:00:34,545
You won't see your mom.

712
01:00:34,837 --> 01:00:38,674
It's all right. I won't put you in jail.
What's your name?

713
01:00:38,883 --> 01:00:42,011
- Don't tell him, Alfred.
- Alfred!

714
01:00:42,469 --> 01:00:45,807
This is Alfred! Hey, meet Alfred.
This is Alfred.

715
01:00:46,057 --> 01:00:48,685
Alfred, hi! How old are you?

716
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,228
Six.

717
01:00:50,604 --> 01:00:54,232
Six years old. I bet you like Go- Bots.

718
01:00:54,441 --> 01:00:55,859
Is that a real gun?

719
01:00:56,318 --> 01:00:58,279
Yeah, this is a real gun.

720
01:00:58,738 --> 01:00:59,906
Do you kill people?

721
01:01:00,197 --> 01:01:04,494
No. If some guy is hurting someone,
I try to shoot him in the leg...

722
01:01:04,745 --> 01:01:06,121
...just to stop him.

723
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,874
Mama says policemen shoot black people.

724
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:11,043
- Is it true?
- Yeah, is it true?

725
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:13,045
Is that true?

726
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,925
Maybe we ought to get the kids some...

727
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:19,509
Ice cream.

728
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:21,011
You like ice cream?

729
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:30,147
No, not you, Alfred.

730
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,696
The man you saw,
did you get a good look at him?

731
01:01:37,947 --> 01:01:40,241
- I saw him.
- Great!

732
01:01:40,908 --> 01:01:45,162
Picture him in your head.
Close your eyes.

733
01:01:45,747 --> 01:01:47,999
Think what he looks like.

734
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:49,459
Got it?

735
01:01:49,918 --> 01:01:51,378
Can you draw him?

736
01:01:52,879 --> 01:01:55,882
Give me some drawing paper and crayons.

737
01:01:56,341 --> 01:01:58,635
- This is good.
- Can it, man.

738
01:01:58,885 --> 01:02:01,222
We're gonna put out an APB on Big Bird.

739
01:02:01,597 --> 01:02:04,392
"All units. Large yellow bird, silly voice."

740
01:02:04,767 --> 01:02:07,604
You're hilarious, Martin. It's enough.

741
01:02:07,813 --> 01:02:09,565
Tell me what he looks like.

742
01:02:10,774 --> 01:02:11,858
Was he black?

743
01:02:13,068 --> 01:02:14,111
Was he white?

744
01:02:17,114 --> 01:02:17,948
Was he tall?

745
01:02:19,324 --> 01:02:20,867
Tall like me?

746
01:02:21,076 --> 01:02:23,161
What color was his hair? Brown?

747
01:02:24,413 --> 01:02:25,872
Black?

748
01:02:26,415 --> 01:02:27,875
Blond?

749
01:02:28,084 --> 01:02:29,586
His hair was blond.

750
01:02:30,712 --> 01:02:34,133
What did he have on?
Did he have jeans on?

751
01:02:34,341 --> 01:02:35,593
It was paint.

752
01:02:35,843 --> 01:02:37,094
Pained?

753
01:02:37,761 --> 01:02:38,762
I don't know.

754
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:42,224
Painted?

755
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:45,436
Painted. A tattoo?

756
01:02:47,062 --> 01:02:50,358
Like Popeye?
A tattoo like Popeye? No?

757
01:02:51,443 --> 01:02:52,611
It was that.

758
01:02:55,113 --> 01:02:56,573
Like that?

759
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,742
Exactly like that?

760
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:02,704
I saw it good. This is it.

761
01:03:02,913 --> 01:03:04,290
I remember.

762
01:03:04,749 --> 01:03:06,042
Are you sure?

763
01:03:06,584 --> 01:03:07,877
It had a knife, even.

764
01:03:19,431 --> 01:03:22,434
Roger, that's a Special Forces tattoo.

765
01:03:23,268 --> 01:03:24,436
Really?

766
01:03:26,146 --> 01:03:29,608
A Special Forces tattoo, mercury switches...

767
01:03:33,613 --> 01:03:36,200
What the hell have we gotten into here?

768
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:42,456
Wonder if there's an opening
in the fire department?

769
01:03:52,676 --> 01:03:53,843
Want to tell me about it?

770
01:03:54,344 --> 01:03:56,721
- About what?
- Don't bullshit me.

771
01:03:56,972 --> 01:04:00,392
Your daughter wasn't killed
for something she was into.

772
01:04:00,642 --> 01:04:02,852
She was killed for something you're into.

773
01:04:04,604 --> 01:04:05,814
Stop me if I'm wrong.

774
01:04:07,149 --> 01:04:09,193
I don't know what you mean.

775
01:04:10,361 --> 01:04:13,323
Keep your hands away from your pocket, okay?

776
01:04:13,949 --> 01:04:14,783
Easy, man.

777
01:04:14,992 --> 01:04:15,826
Fuck easy.

778
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:22,291
You called me the other day
to blow the whistle, right?

779
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,585
Blow the whistle on what?

780
01:04:24,793 --> 01:04:28,088
You were going to tell all,
so they killed your daughter.

781
01:04:28,338 --> 01:04:31,008
Tell me if I'm wrong.
Talk to me!

782
01:04:31,341 --> 01:04:33,511
They killed your daughter.

783
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:36,889
They paid off a hooker to poison
your little girl.

784
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:39,184
Chrissake!
I've got another daughter.

785
01:04:39,435 --> 01:04:42,730
- She'll be protected.
- You don't know these people.

786
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:45,024
Acquaint me with them.

787
01:04:48,569 --> 01:04:50,279
It goes back to the war.

788
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:57,746
I worked with a group called
"Air America." CIA front.

789
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:02,667
They secretly ran
the entire war out of Laos.

790
01:05:03,376 --> 01:05:07,547
I was with a special unit called
"Shadow Company." Trained killers.

791
01:05:07,881 --> 01:05:11,385
When Charlie brought in heroin
to finance the VC government...

792
01:05:11,636 --> 01:05:14,430
...Shadow Company burned
the whole thing down.

793
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:16,725
We killed everybody.

794
01:05:21,772 --> 01:05:23,523
We also formed a plan.

795
01:05:23,941 --> 01:05:25,067
Keep talking.

796
01:05:31,281 --> 01:05:34,660
A few years ago, Shadow Company
got together again.

797
01:05:35,077 --> 01:05:36,746
The war was over.

798
01:05:37,747 --> 01:05:40,375
But we still had our sources in Asia.

799
01:05:41,627 --> 01:05:43,671
We've been bringing it in ever since.

800
01:05:44,046 --> 01:05:45,339
Bringing in what?

801
01:05:46,423 --> 01:05:47,800
Heroin.

802
01:05:48,259 --> 01:05:50,511
Two major shipments a year.

803
01:05:53,931 --> 01:05:56,308
It's all run by ex- CIA.

804
01:05:57,102 --> 01:05:59,104
Soldiers, mercs.

805
01:05:59,938 --> 01:06:02,023
You son of a bitch!

806
01:06:02,232 --> 01:06:06,152
If you had cold feet, why did
they kill Amanda? Why not you?

807
01:06:06,361 --> 01:06:08,780
- They can't. They need me.
- Why?

808
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:14,078
My company is a perfect front. Makes
everything look great on tax reports.

809
01:06:17,791 --> 01:06:20,127
This is big business, Roger.

810
01:06:24,965 --> 01:06:26,508
Not anymore.

811
01:06:27,634 --> 01:06:29,636
I'm gonna burn it down.

812
01:06:29,845 --> 01:06:31,680
You can't. It's too big.

813
01:06:32,264 --> 01:06:35,267
These people are trained,
expert killers.

814
01:06:35,767 --> 01:06:39,897
Tell me about your next shipment:
Where it's coming in, how many...

815
01:06:40,106 --> 01:06:42,817
I can't tell you that, Roger.
I can't.

816
01:06:43,484 --> 01:06:48,115
I have another daughter. You can't
protect her. I'm in this too deep.

817
01:07:07,385 --> 01:07:11,014
Heroin.
You got off easy, you son of a bitch!

818
01:07:31,703 --> 01:07:32,871
You through?

819
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:35,040
I haven't even started.

820
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:39,878
Gen. McAllister, this is Delta One.
We're coming in. Over.

821
01:07:40,587 --> 01:07:43,007
- So your mission is accomplished?
- Yes, sir.

822
01:07:43,258 --> 01:07:45,426
Mr. Hunsaker is dead, sir.

823
01:07:45,718 --> 01:07:48,597
I'm afraid, however,
that another problem exists.

824
01:07:48,847 --> 01:07:50,432
What is it? Explain.

825
01:07:50,683 --> 01:07:52,685
Hunsaker spoke to the police.

826
01:07:52,977 --> 01:07:56,272
- Are they dead?
- No, I missed the opportunity.

827
01:07:56,522 --> 01:08:00,401
Very disappointing. So the police
may know the whole operation?

828
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:02,279
That is correct, sir.

829
01:08:02,904 --> 01:08:05,282
Joshua, it's time we turned up the heat.

830
01:08:05,532 --> 01:08:06,950
Come on home.

831
01:08:25,262 --> 01:08:28,181
What's a nice Irish girl
like you doing out here?

832
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:31,476
I'm looking for a guy,
had this girl in his stable.

833
01:08:31,685 --> 01:08:34,771
- Never seen her.
- She's in your line of work. You sure?

834
01:08:35,063 --> 01:08:37,566
- Sure. Why?
- I'm a police officer.

835
01:08:37,774 --> 01:08:40,444
Don't worry, I won't drag your
ass to jail...

836
01:09:07,974 --> 01:09:09,351
You wore your vest!

837
01:09:10,435 --> 01:09:12,771
That was smart, kid. Come on.

838
01:09:14,981 --> 01:09:17,317
Hold on! I'm on your side.

839
01:09:19,986 --> 01:09:22,406
Son of a bitch, that hurts!

840
01:09:23,074 --> 01:09:25,534
I'm pissed, Roger! Now I'm pissed.

841
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:28,789
Look at your face!

842
01:09:29,122 --> 01:09:31,250
Two inches higher,
he'd have hit your head.

843
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:34,044
Two inches lower,
I'd be a falsetto for life.

844
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:36,171
I bet you'd sound nice too.

845
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:39,925
- Where's my gun?
- Here.

846
01:09:43,011 --> 01:09:44,721
Oh, shit! Roger!

847
01:09:45,555 --> 01:09:47,600
The guy who shot me...

848
01:09:48,268 --> 01:09:51,771
The same albino jackrabbit
son of a bitch that did Hunsaker.

849
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:52,815
You sure?

850
01:09:53,232 --> 01:09:55,818
I'm sure, man.
I never forget an asshole.

851
01:09:56,068 --> 01:09:57,736
I got an idea.

852
01:09:58,487 --> 01:10:02,116
We fly first class to Detroit
and lay low for a couple weeks.

853
01:10:02,324 --> 01:10:04,702
Come on, be serious.
What do we do?

854
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:06,036
What else?

855
01:10:06,287 --> 01:10:08,957
We bury the fuckers.
And you know what else?

856
01:10:09,165 --> 01:10:13,295
We do this right, we get famous.
Do shaving ads. Girls. Money.

857
01:10:14,087 --> 01:10:16,756
With our luck, we'll do
Forest Lawn commercials.

858
01:10:16,965 --> 01:10:19,259
Bullshit! We got the edge.

859
01:10:20,343 --> 01:10:23,973
Roger, they think I'm dead.
I'm a corpse.

860
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:31,648
Brilliant.

861
01:10:33,692 --> 01:10:35,444
Brilliant shit!

862
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:40,115
We got a body for you.

863
01:10:40,365 --> 01:10:43,910
He was at Hunsaker's place.
I saw him, he saw me.

864
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:46,121
Get someone else to do it, okay?

865
01:10:46,455 --> 01:10:50,585
Captain says give it to you.
About two blocks from your house.

866
01:10:51,085 --> 01:10:54,797
Yeah, sure. He's probably blond
with big dimples.

867
01:10:55,132 --> 01:10:57,468
How did you know that, sarge?

868
01:10:59,345 --> 01:11:00,262
Get in here!

869
01:11:01,764 --> 01:11:02,806
Trouble.

870
01:11:06,143 --> 01:11:10,022
They just gave a description
of the kid my daughter's dating.

871
01:11:37,511 --> 01:11:39,680
Let's be dark and quiet.

872
01:12:21,016 --> 01:12:23,226
The bastards got my daughter.

873
01:12:34,698 --> 01:12:35,657
What is it?

874
01:12:36,408 --> 01:12:37,242
Nothing.

875
01:12:37,451 --> 01:12:38,994
- What is it?!
- Nothing!

876
01:12:39,244 --> 01:12:41,997
Get back in your room.
Back in your room!

877
01:12:59,307 --> 01:13:01,268
You have a beautiful daughter.

878
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:04,939
I'd stick by the phone to find out
where to meet us.

879
01:13:10,945 --> 01:13:12,696
They got my kid.

880
01:13:14,448 --> 01:13:16,534
Bastards took my baby.

881
01:13:40,018 --> 01:13:42,646
Sgt. McCaskey, pick up line three.

882
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,232
Homicide, McCaskey speaking.

883
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,775
This is KCOP news.

884
01:13:46,984 --> 01:13:51,363
We heard an officer was shot tonight.
Can you give us more information?

885
01:13:51,613 --> 01:13:55,367
Sgt. Martin Riggs was shot and killed.
Who is this?

886
01:13:55,575 --> 01:13:57,536
We'll send somebody right over.

887
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:04,586
Bingo! Riggs is out of the picture.

888
01:14:05,004 --> 01:14:06,755
I want Murtaugh taken alive.

889
01:14:07,298 --> 01:14:08,757
He may not talk.

890
01:14:10,009 --> 01:14:11,927
We have his little girl.
He'll talk.

891
01:14:28,028 --> 01:14:30,864
You know they're gonna kill her, don't you?

892
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:38,581
And if you want her back,
you'll have to take her away from them.

893
01:14:38,914 --> 01:14:40,208
I know.

894
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:49,551
We do this my way.
You shoot and you shoot to kill.

895
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:54,514
Get as many as you can.
All you got to do is just not miss.

896
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:56,266
I won't miss.

897
01:14:58,268 --> 01:15:01,189
We're going to get bloody on this one.

898
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,071
Are you really crazy?

899
01:15:09,823 --> 01:15:12,117
Or are you as good as you say you are?

900
01:15:14,244 --> 01:15:16,121
You're gonna have to trust me.

901
01:15:20,125 --> 01:15:21,460
Here we go.

902
01:15:28,176 --> 01:15:32,430
We don 't want your daughter.
We want to know what Hunsaker told you.

903
01:15:32,639 --> 01:15:36,685
Dry lake. Victorville.
Sunrise tomorrow. Be there.

904
01:18:41,551 --> 01:18:42,886
Murtaugh!

905
01:18:43,511 --> 01:18:44,929
Yes, that's right.

906
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:47,141
Show me my daughter!

907
01:18:47,475 --> 01:18:50,311
Let me see her, then I'll come quietly.

908
01:18:57,277 --> 01:18:58,945
He wants to see the girl.

909
01:18:59,154 --> 01:19:00,405
Get out.

910
01:19:05,911 --> 01:19:07,162
Daddy!

911
01:19:07,663 --> 01:19:09,998
Okay, baby! I'm here.

912
01:19:10,499 --> 01:19:12,418
Okay, it's all right.

913
01:19:12,669 --> 01:19:13,628
Simple exchange.

914
01:19:14,671 --> 01:19:18,258
You come with us,
the girl takes a walk.

915
01:19:18,509 --> 01:19:19,969
Let her go now.

916
01:19:22,221 --> 01:19:25,808
As I say, take your hands
out of your pockets.

917
01:19:26,016 --> 01:19:27,685
Sure thing, pal.

918
01:19:31,522 --> 01:19:32,523
It's alive.

919
01:19:35,026 --> 01:19:37,654
Let her go now, or we all die.

920
01:19:38,488 --> 01:19:39,572
Take him!

921
01:19:39,906 --> 01:19:41,157
He has a grenade!

922
01:19:41,408 --> 01:19:44,369
He's bluffing!
He wouldn't risk killing his daughter.

923
01:19:45,161 --> 01:19:46,705
If she's gonna die...

924
01:19:46,955 --> 01:19:50,376
. . .she's gonna die with me.
My way, not yours.

925
01:19:55,549 --> 01:19:59,928
Come on, Roger, get out of the way.
Move to your left. Come on!

926
01:20:00,178 --> 01:20:01,638
Put the pin back in.

927
01:20:02,139 --> 01:20:05,976
Officer Murtaugh, don't be foolish.
Look at the hardware.

928
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:07,936
Move to your left.

929
01:20:13,608 --> 01:20:17,113
Look at the firepower.
You're grounded. Riggs is gone.

930
01:20:17,488 --> 01:20:19,657
Put the pin back in the grenade.

931
01:20:19,866 --> 01:20:21,452
If you come closer...

932
01:20:21,952 --> 01:20:23,245
...then we all die.

933
01:20:24,788 --> 01:20:26,457
I don't think so.

934
01:20:34,465 --> 01:20:36,259
Come on, honey.

935
01:20:38,345 --> 01:20:39,346
Just a smoker.

936
01:20:39,596 --> 01:20:40,430
Bingo.

937
01:20:45,977 --> 01:20:46,853
Where is he?

938
01:20:47,062 --> 01:20:47,896
It's Riggs.

939
01:20:50,315 --> 01:20:52,652
Rianne, get in the car!

940
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,030
Get in the fucking car!

941
01:21:14,007 --> 01:21:15,509
Go, Rianne, go!

942
01:21:15,842 --> 01:21:18,596
Come on, cottontail, stick your head up.

943
01:21:20,056 --> 01:21:22,558
That's it, you son of a bitch.
Good night.

944
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:28,941
Don't try it, son.
You're not that fast.

945
01:21:30,943 --> 01:21:32,778
Hello, Joshua. Hello, Joshua.

946
01:21:32,987 --> 01:21:34,738
- Yes, sir.
- I got Riggs.

947
01:21:35,531 --> 01:21:38,242
He's got Riggs. Go get the girl!

948
01:22:13,655 --> 01:22:15,657
Throw your weapon down!

949
01:22:15,907 --> 01:22:18,243
Put your hands behind your head!

950
01:22:22,332 --> 01:22:26,003
You're Gen. Peter McAllister,
commander of Shadow Company.

951
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:29,089
I see we've heard of each other.

952
01:22:29,298 --> 01:22:32,843
Yep. It'll almost be a shame
when I nail you.

953
01:22:33,761 --> 01:22:38,098
I ran into some of those Shadow Company
pussies in Saigon in '69.

954
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:39,683
You did, did you?

955
01:23:26,818 --> 01:23:28,653
Leave me alone!

956
01:23:55,390 --> 01:23:57,684
Save your strength.
You'll need it.

957
01:23:58,101 --> 01:23:59,060
Who's the Chin?

958
01:24:00,271 --> 01:24:02,857
Endo, meet Mr. Martin Riggs.

959
01:24:03,983 --> 01:24:06,945
Endo has forgotten more
about dispensing pain...

960
01:24:07,154 --> 01:24:08,405
...than we'll ever know.

961
01:24:10,282 --> 01:24:12,034
See, we have a problem.

962
01:24:12,242 --> 01:24:14,036
Since we have Murtaugh...

963
01:24:14,578 --> 01:24:15,871
...we don't need you.

964
01:24:16,204 --> 01:24:19,583
- I believe in being thorough.
- I've heard that about you.

965
01:24:21,793 --> 01:24:24,463
Our problem, and yours too...

966
01:24:25,213 --> 01:24:28,217
...is we have a shipment
of merchandise to deliver.

967
01:24:28,426 --> 01:24:30,303
Why don't you just call it heroin?

968
01:24:31,972 --> 01:24:34,350
It's rather large, this shipment.

969
01:24:35,309 --> 01:24:37,227
It would be unfortunate...

970
01:24:37,436 --> 01:24:40,189
...if we showed up
to deliver our heroin...

971
01:24:40,856 --> 01:24:42,608
...and were surrounded by 50 cops.

972
01:24:42,816 --> 01:24:44,026
That would be too bad.

973
01:24:44,276 --> 01:24:45,819
Yes, it would be.

974
01:24:46,779 --> 01:24:49,699
So we have to find out all the cops know.

975
01:24:49,908 --> 01:24:52,869
We don't know shit.
You did Hunsaker before he could say...

976
01:24:55,246 --> 01:24:58,792
I wish I could believe you.
Unfortunately, I don't.

977
01:25:03,923 --> 01:25:06,801
Now, if you tell me everything you know...

978
01:25:07,051 --> 01:25:09,346
...I promise you I'll kill you quick.

979
01:25:11,515 --> 01:25:13,266
I told you everything I know.

980
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:21,984
What is that thing?

981
01:25:23,902 --> 01:25:25,278
I'll tell you.

982
01:25:26,238 --> 01:25:28,281
It's electric shock treatment.

983
01:25:30,284 --> 01:25:33,371
We're in for a long night,
because I don't know shit.

984
01:25:35,708 --> 01:25:37,084
We'll see.

985
01:25:45,843 --> 01:25:46,760
Hit him again!

986
01:25:56,896 --> 01:25:57,731
Again!

987
01:26:03,153 --> 01:26:04,696
Tell me about the shipment!

988
01:26:07,116 --> 01:26:09,660
I'm gonna fucking kill both of you!

989
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:12,289
Very funny.
What about the shipment?

990
01:26:17,961 --> 01:26:20,047
The shipment, Mr. Murtaugh.

991
01:26:20,505 --> 01:26:22,341
Go spit!

992
01:26:23,675 --> 01:26:24,593
Salt.

993
01:26:40,110 --> 01:26:43,947
Go spit, you son of a bitch.
Fuck you!

994
01:26:44,782 --> 01:26:46,408
This is getting nowhere.

995
01:26:46,617 --> 01:26:47,785
Mr. Large.

996
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:56,378
He knows shit. We're safe.

997
01:26:56,586 --> 01:26:59,464
He'd have told us.
Nobody can take that.

998
01:27:00,173 --> 01:27:01,508
Fine.

999
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:03,134
Badass soldier, huh?

1000
01:27:17,776 --> 01:27:18,944
Get her up.

1001
01:27:24,074 --> 01:27:26,743
Untie me and I'll kill all of you bastards!

1002
01:27:26,952 --> 01:27:28,704
Tell me what you know.

1003
01:27:28,912 --> 01:27:31,623
Fuck you, bastard!
I'll kill you!

1004
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:40,884
Sorry, pal.
Say good night.

1005
01:28:02,741 --> 01:28:05,994
That's a real good- looking young woman...

1006
01:28:06,202 --> 01:28:08,580
...you got there, Mr. Murtaugh.

1007
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:12,710
I've told you everything.

1008
01:28:12,918 --> 01:28:14,420
We'll soon know, won't we?

1009
01:28:14,628 --> 01:28:16,213
I'm warning you.

1010
01:28:16,673 --> 01:28:17,507
Don't.

1011
01:28:17,966 --> 01:28:20,177
Spare me, son. It's over.

1012
01:28:20,677 --> 01:28:23,138
There's no more heroes left in the world.

1013
01:28:28,602 --> 01:28:29,853
Kill that son of a bitch!

1014
01:28:41,324 --> 01:28:42,993
That asshole's getting away!

1015
01:28:43,243 --> 01:28:45,245
Who's fucking next?

1016
01:28:45,704 --> 01:28:47,247
McAllister!

1017
01:28:47,498 --> 01:28:48,666
Who's next?

1018
01:28:51,752 --> 01:28:53,337
Pretty thin, huh?

1019
01:28:53,587 --> 01:28:55,047
Anorexic.

1020
01:29:02,555 --> 01:29:04,849
- Let's do what the shepherd did.
- What?

1021
01:29:05,058 --> 01:29:06,851
Get the flock out of here.

1022
01:29:18,781 --> 01:29:20,158
Is it him?

1023
01:29:20,492 --> 01:29:22,619
No. It's not Joshua.

1024
01:30:39,534 --> 01:30:41,370
Halt! Stop! Stop!

1025
01:30:41,578 --> 01:30:44,332
Get out of the fucking car!
Come on, now!

1026
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,252
Police officers!

1027
01:31:04,813 --> 01:31:09,734
I'm a police officer. Give me
some backup and take care of the girl.

1028
01:31:39,808 --> 01:31:41,685
He's going for the freeway!

1029
01:31:41,893 --> 01:31:42,728
You okay?

1030
01:31:47,233 --> 01:31:51,237
Cut over the 3rd Street bridge!
You'll get ahead of him.

1031
01:31:54,366 --> 01:31:56,201
General McAllister...

1032
01:31:57,870 --> 01:31:59,913
...time for you to die.

1033
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:49,509
Hold it!

1034
01:33:12,242 --> 01:33:13,993
Get back in your car!

1035
01:33:36,101 --> 01:33:38,228
Mind if I test drive your Audi?

1036
01:33:41,857 --> 01:33:44,067
Stop the son of a bitch!

1037
01:33:49,156 --> 01:33:50,073
Shit!

1038
01:33:52,201 --> 01:33:53,536
He got my car!

1039
01:33:56,372 --> 01:33:58,459
- Get back!
- Hey, man, I'm cool.

1040
01:34:09,595 --> 01:34:11,221
Let's get out of here!

1041
01:34:15,185 --> 01:34:16,186
Open the door!

1042
01:34:26,279 --> 01:34:28,574
Kill that cop son of a bitch!

1043
01:34:30,993 --> 01:34:33,412
No way you live. No way.

1044
01:35:59,505 --> 01:36:01,674
- Gangway!
- Hold it now.

1045
01:36:01,924 --> 01:36:04,053
- Police officer.
- Go ahead.

1046
01:36:09,516 --> 01:36:12,311
Well, shit!
What now, kid?

1047
01:36:12,936 --> 01:36:15,564
First thing, we get you to hospital.

1048
01:36:16,106 --> 01:36:17,775
Come on. Let's go.

1049
01:36:18,651 --> 01:36:21,446
Don't breathe this stuff.
You'll see pink elephants.

1050
01:36:21,696 --> 01:36:23,656
The slippery son of a bitch got away!

1051
01:36:23,907 --> 01:36:26,576
- What do you mean he got away?
- Hey, fire me.

1052
01:36:29,746 --> 01:36:30,914
Where you going?

1053
01:36:31,247 --> 01:36:33,124
Sarge, I'm commandeering your car.

1054
01:36:33,375 --> 01:36:34,668
What's the matter?

1055
01:36:34,877 --> 01:36:37,463
My home!
The bastard knows where I live.

1056
01:36:37,671 --> 01:36:39,549
I'll drive, Cochise.

1057
01:36:40,592 --> 01:36:43,261
- I got to look at him!
- He's all right.

1058
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:49,393
3- W- 30 en route to
Sgt. Murtaugh's residence.

1059
01:36:49,643 --> 01:36:51,937
Requesting additional units.

1060
01:37:25,724 --> 01:37:27,559
Excuse me, sir.
May we help you?

1061
01:37:28,059 --> 01:37:29,060
No, thank you.

1062
01:37:56,423 --> 01:37:58,300
Good morning, sir.

1063
01:37:59,509 --> 01:38:01,678
Tell me, what day is it?

1064
01:38:03,056 --> 01:38:04,724
Goddamn Christmas!

1065
01:38:06,267 --> 01:38:08,729
I'll give you a home to come back to.

1066
01:38:26,831 --> 01:38:29,042
Crazy son of a bitch!

1067
01:38:48,605 --> 01:38:50,232
Give me that. Drop it.

1068
01:38:59,950 --> 01:39:01,451
Looking for the general?

1069
01:39:02,911 --> 01:39:06,749
He's barbecuing his nuts
on Hollywood Boulevard.

1070
01:39:14,508 --> 01:39:16,343
What do you say, Jack?

1071
01:39:17,344 --> 01:39:19,096
Like a shot at the title?

1072
01:39:20,097 --> 01:39:21,765
Don't mind if I do.

1073
01:39:38,450 --> 01:39:42,872
Okay, men! I'm Sgt. Murtaugh.
My responsibility here!

1074
01:39:43,664 --> 01:39:45,332
Watch commander is en route.

1075
01:39:45,583 --> 01:39:49,045
Until then, Sgt. Murtaugh
is in charge on site.

1076
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:55,302
Just keep the citizens clear.

1077
01:40:07,272 --> 01:40:09,025
Keep everyone back!

1078
01:40:17,284 --> 01:40:20,245
It's Sgt. Riggs' arrest.
I take full responsibility!

1079
01:40:20,454 --> 01:40:22,831
The son of a bitch killed two of our men!

1080
01:40:28,754 --> 01:40:30,256
Get him, kid!
He's yours!

1081
01:40:45,188 --> 01:40:46,941
Come on, Riggs! Come on!

1082
01:40:55,492 --> 01:40:58,203
You wanna quit now?
You wanna quit?

1083
01:41:07,754 --> 01:41:09,756
Give me your nightstick!

1084
01:41:19,768 --> 01:41:20,811
Come on!

1085
01:41:21,645 --> 01:41:23,063
Show me what you got!

1086
01:41:29,987 --> 01:41:31,488
Eat this, sucker!

1087
01:41:57,184 --> 01:41:58,268
Let them take him!

1088
01:41:59,269 --> 01:42:00,771
Let me take him!

1089
01:42:02,939 --> 01:42:04,524
No! Back off!

1090
01:42:43,316 --> 01:42:44,692
Break his fucking neck!

1091
01:42:52,910 --> 01:42:53,744
It's not worth it.

1092
01:42:59,876 --> 01:43:01,211
You lose.

1093
01:43:09,845 --> 01:43:12,013
Get that shit off my lawn!

1094
01:43:17,145 --> 01:43:18,521
How you doing, kid?

1095
01:43:44,132 --> 01:43:45,467
I got you.

1096
01:43:45,925 --> 01:43:47,385
I got you, partner.

1097
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:26,428
Merry Christmas, Victoria Lynn.

1098
01:44:28,180 --> 01:44:29,473
I love you.

1099
01:44:54,624 --> 01:44:55,792
How are you?

1100
01:44:56,459 --> 01:44:58,796
I'm going to be all right. You?

1101
01:44:59,171 --> 01:45:00,464
I'm good.

1102
01:45:03,635 --> 01:45:05,512
Give this to your dad, okay?

1103
01:45:05,846 --> 01:45:09,015
It's a present for him.
Tell him I won't need it anymore.

1104
01:45:09,808 --> 01:45:12,853
- It's a bullet.
- Yeah, it's a bullet.

1105
01:45:13,645 --> 01:45:15,188
He'll understand.

1106
01:45:16,898 --> 01:45:18,984
You want to come in?
We're building.

1107
01:45:20,944 --> 01:45:22,905
No, I gotta go.

1108
01:45:25,241 --> 01:45:27,326
You have a nice Christmas, though.

1109
01:45:27,869 --> 01:45:29,163
Okay. You too.

1110
01:45:30,247 --> 01:45:31,165
Okay. Bye.

1111
01:45:31,498 --> 01:45:32,666
Bye.

1112
01:45:47,682 --> 01:45:49,768
After all we've been through...

1113
01:45:49,976 --> 01:45:54,189
...if you think I'm gonna eat
the world's worst turkey by myself...

1114
01:45:54,439 --> 01:45:55,565
...you're crazy.

1115
01:45:56,691 --> 01:45:59,570
- I'll tell you a little secret.
- What?

1116
01:45:59,779 --> 01:46:01,113
I'm not crazy.

1117
01:46:03,741 --> 01:46:04,659
I know.

1118
01:46:05,577 --> 01:46:06,703
Oh, good. Let's eat.

1119
01:46:08,288 --> 01:46:09,831
Hey, you know something?

1120
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:12,000
I think your daughter likes me.

1121
01:46:12,250 --> 01:46:14,628
- If you touch her, I'll kill you.
- You'll try.

1122
01:46:14,878 --> 01:46:18,131
- You mind if I bring a friend?
- Of course, bring a friend.

1123
01:46:26,557 --> 01:46:28,768
I don't think the cat will like this.

1124
01:46:29,018 --> 01:46:31,063
I'll put five on the mutt.

1125
01:46:39,988 --> 01:46:42,199
I'm too old for this.
