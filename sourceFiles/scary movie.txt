Hi, Mom. (SHRIEKS)

174
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,924
I got to call you back.

175
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,963
No baby, no baby, no baby, no baby.

177
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,645
(FEMALE VOICE) You're pregnant...
No!

178
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,725
...with anticipation over
the outcome of this iPregnancy test,

179
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,804
which has determined that you are...

180
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,371
You got to be kidding me.

181
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,241
Oh, no.

182
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,925
Not pregnant.

183
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,009
You dodged a bullet, you lucky slut.

184
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,084
(SIGHS) Thank you, God. Sweet!

185
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,403
Great news:
They found my brother's kids.

186
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,846
Oh, crap.

187
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,571
(MAN) We're very fortunate
the older one, Kathy, has retained

188
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,205
most of her vocabulary.

189
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,488
The baby hasn't actually said a word.

190
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,968
Why not?
Because he's a baby.

191
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,567
They've been alone here
over three long months.

192
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,362
I need to warn both of you
that this is not going to be easy.

193
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,602
I'm ready for it.

194
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,286
Hello.
No, no. Wrong window.

195
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,920
Here's where the children are.

197
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,648
What is she doing?
(MAN) In order to survive

198
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,282
their extreme isolation, the girls
created an imaginary guardian,

199
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,650
a parent figure to feed them,
sing to them. They call her Mama.

200
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,446
But these may help you break through.

201
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,329
And the Ritalin may help, as well.

202
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,767
The proper dosage
for someone their age is...

203
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,206
Wish me luck.

(CHILD PANTING)

205
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,250
Hey, Lily.

206
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,970
Oh, how cute.

207
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,643
OK.
Kathy.

208
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,726
It's OK, Kathy. Remember these?

209
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,565
You used to wear them
to help you see better.

210
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,650
No, no, no!

211
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,844
Maybe we should get her
some contacts... the soft kind.

212
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,011
Daddy?

213
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,366
No, sweetheart. Not Daddy.

214
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,164
I'm your Uncle Dan. Remember?

215
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,765
And this is Jody.

216
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,888
Jo...

217
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,884
Jody.
No pause between "Jo" and "dy."

218
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,008
Jo...

219
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,601
Dan, we're at an impasse.
I see constant conflict.

220
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,808
It's fine. They'll warm up to you.

221
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,371
(CHILD GROWLING)
Oh!

222
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,000
Hey, hey, hey, little lady,
that's not how...

223
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,810
You little mother...!

224
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,047
Well, everything checks out.
They seem like good kids, Doc.

225
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,486
Just validate our parking.
We'll take them home.

226
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,927
Folks, I wish it were that easy.
You don't validate?

227
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,321
I'm saying the kids
are not yours to take.

228
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,448
Well, you can't win them all.
Let's skedaddle.

229
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,611
That's not fair. They're my brother
Charlie's kids. We deserve them.

230
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,128
Do you? Your wife plays in a punk rock
band, staying out all night long,

231
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,965
high on drugs, sleeping with
a different man every night.

232
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,885
I don't think the courts
are gonna look upon that too favorably.

233
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,371
But...
I was just messing with you.

234
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,760
The kids are yours.
They are?

235
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,365
Did you hear that, honey? They're ours!

236
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,127
On one condition. This house is owned
by the Institute for Case Studies.

237
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,328
Every room is fully wired with cameras.

238
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,086
If you move into the house,
you get the kids.

239
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,130
Can't we just sell the house and put
the kids in a high-end orphanage?

240
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,487
Jody, do you really think
you're out out to be a mom?

241
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,641
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

242
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,046
Of course she is.
Dan!

243
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,124
Now, no more rock band,
no more silly wig.

244
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,362
It's not silly. It's all a part of me.

245
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,363
And no more tattoos.
What are you doing?

246
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,166
What I had to.
We're a perfect suburban couple.

247
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,087
(NARRATOR) And so Dan and Jody headed to
their new house with their new children.

248
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,562
But, like a slutty sorority girl
returning from spring break,

249
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,282
they were also bringing home
a hidden evil.

250
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,171
(JODY) All right, kids,
here's our new house.

251
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,924
And here's Uncle Dan.

252
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,283
Hi. Don't forget about mommy!

253
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,240
Dan, I'm not their mommy.
They can call me Aunt Jody.

254
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,641
Or Jodes, J-Mom, Mrs. Sanders.
(PANTING)

255
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,444
Or, if they really want
to call me... Garage!

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,370

257
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,124

for the very first time.

00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,921
This is where we're going to protect you
and make sure nothing bad...

259
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,650
Oh, my God, Aidan!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

260
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,643
Maybe we should put him in the carrier.

261
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,010
There, see, that's better.
Come on, Aidan. What, what, what?

262
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,447
Relax, it's OK.
Oh, my gosh.

263
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,443
Dan, I lost the baby!
What?

264
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,410
Oh, my gosh, Aidan!
Aidan, where are you?!

265
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,686

(DAN) Where did you go?

00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,084
Oh, there he is, OK. (SIGHING)

267
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,129

Oh, Aidan, it's OK.

in a baby voice.

on these reality wives...
