1
00:00:31,613 --> 00:00:33,240
<i>People ask a question.</i>

2
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,114
<i>What's a RocknRolla?</i>

3
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:42,982
<i>And I tell them it's not about drums,
drugs and hospital drips.</i>

4
00:00:43,158 --> 00:00:44,648
<i>Oh, no.</i>

5
00:00:44,826 --> 00:00:47,488
<i>There's more there than that, my friend.</i>

6
00:00:47,863 --> 00:00:50,331
<i>We all like a bit of the good life.</i>

7
00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:51,966
<i>Some, the money.</i>

8
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:53,965
<i>Some, the drugs.</i>

9
00:00:54,136 --> 00:00:58,869
<i>Others the sex game,
the glamour or the fame.</i>

10
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:03,444
<i>But a RocknRolla, oh, he's different.</i>

11
00:01:03,612 --> 00:01:05,011
<i>Why?</i>

12
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,618
<i>Because a real RocknRolla
wants the fucking lot.</i>

13
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:50,089
<i>My name's Archy,
formerly known as Archibald.</i>

14
00:01:50,258 --> 00:01:52,522
<i>I work for a man called Lenny Cole.</i>

15
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:56,755
<i>And Lenny Cole has the keys
to the back door of this booming city.</i>

16
00:01:56,932 --> 00:01:59,492
<i>Let me give you an example
of how Lenny works his magic.</i>

17
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:03,931
<i>Two years ago,
this property cost 1 million pounds.</i>

18
00:02:04,106 --> 00:02:06,336
Today, it costs 5 million.

19
00:02:06,508 --> 00:02:07,600
How did this happen?

20
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:10,677
Attractive tax opportunities
for foreign investment...

21
00:02:10,846 --> 00:02:14,009
...restrictive building consent
and massive hedge-fund bonuses.

22
00:02:14,182 --> 00:02:15,206
London, my good man...

23
00:02:15,383 --> 00:02:18,511
...is fast becoming the financial
and cultural capital of the world.

24
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:20,484
<i>London is on the rise.</i>

25
00:02:20,655 --> 00:02:24,091
<i>Property value has gone one way: up.</i>

26
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:28,127
<i>And this has left the natives struggling
to keep a foothold in the property ladder.</i>

27
00:02:28,296 --> 00:02:30,059
I can't teach you how to skin a cat...

28
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:33,224
...but I can tell you a lot
about the money in bricks and mortar.

29
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:35,767
Like he said, it's going one way.

30
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:37,427
You need to see a lawyer.

31
00:02:38,874 --> 00:02:40,273
We do need to see a lawyer.

32
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:42,933
Well, it looks like a great deal.

33
00:02:43,578 --> 00:02:44,704
These are the plans.

34
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,906
It'll cost 10,
and it'll be worth 20 with planning.

35
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,347
But, first, you gotta give
the Councillor a drink.

36
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,317
<i>Same deal as before.
I'll tell them they've got the planning.</i>

37
00:02:53,488 --> 00:02:55,285
<i>Thank you, Councillor.</i>

38
00:02:56,158 --> 00:02:57,420
You'll get the planning.

39
00:02:57,592 --> 00:03:01,392
Take care of the Councillor,
and it'll move like shit through a goose.

40
00:03:02,564 --> 00:03:03,588
We need help.

41
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:04,823
Lenny Cole.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,365
Dog number one.

43
00:03:06,535 --> 00:03:08,901
Bet he moves fast
and likes bricks and mortar.

44
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,903
I do move fast,
and I love bricks and mortar.

45
00:03:12,073 --> 00:03:13,540
Property's always a safe bet...

46
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,836
...but you gotta know what you're doing,
this ain't soft money.

47
00:03:17,012 --> 00:03:19,412
<i>Because of these boys'
criminal records...</i>

48
00:03:19,581 --> 00:03:21,776
<i>...the bank won't lend them
the money they need.</i>

49
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,474
<i>Enter Mr. Lenny Cole...</i>

50
00:03:23,652 --> 00:03:26,951
<i>...London's money-loaning
and fast-moving property magician.</i>

51
00:03:27,122 --> 00:03:28,919
Don ' t let me down, boys.

52
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,580
Come on, give me your hand.

53
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:33,319
<i>And this is where he waves
his black magic wand.</i>

54
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:36,020
Can't talk now,
but there's been a problem.

55
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:37,631
I can't get you the planning.

56
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,998
Sorry, boys, can't get the planning.

57
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:43,729
<i>Oh, isn't that an unpleasant surprise.</i>

58
00:03:43,905 --> 00:03:45,702
<i>Because they don't wanna owe Lenny.</i>

59
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:47,273
He can't get the planning.

60
00:03:47,442 --> 00:03:48,932
<i>That's right, sweetheart.</i>

61
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,168
Can't get the planning?

62
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:51,812
<i>You've been fucked.</i>

63
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,380
What do you mean
you can't get the fucking planning?

64
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:56,073
You owe me.

65
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:59,982
Right, I get the building,
you lose your share...

66
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:02,623
...and I'm still out of pocket
two large ones.

67
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,520
Find it.

68
00:04:04,893 --> 00:04:07,828
<i>They know they'll have to pay Lenny
before the month is out.</i>

69
00:04:07,996 --> 00:04:12,626
<i>Because Mr. Cole has ways of making life
very, very uncomfortable.</i>

70
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:14,029
We better find it.

71
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:17,000
<i>What they don't know
is that Lenny controls the councilors...</i>

72
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:18,571
<i>...the judges and the lawyers.</i>

73
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,868
<i>No planning permission will be given
until Lenny wants it.</i>

74
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:24,773
<i>And now that he owns the building,
he wants the permission.</i>

75
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:26,811
Hello, Councillor?

76
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:28,873
Yeah.

77
00:04:29,384 --> 00:04:33,218
Yeah, I hear you got that car
you wanted.

78
00:04:33,688 --> 00:04:34,882
You're very generous, Len.

79
00:04:35,056 --> 00:04:37,490
Right, now, sort that planning out,
will you?

80
00:04:37,993 --> 00:04:40,518
- Sorted, Lenny.
- Good.

81
00:04:44,966 --> 00:04:47,264
What's wrong with you, Archy?

82
00:04:47,435 --> 00:04:49,903
Was that not a bit strong, Len?

83
00:04:50,438 --> 00:04:53,498
They come from the same place as you.
You're gonna clean them out.

84
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:55,165
The same place as me?

85
00:04:55,343 --> 00:04:57,675
Do I look like a fucking immigrant?

86
00:04:57,846 --> 00:04:59,507
No one gave me a leg up.

87
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:03,640
They need a little bit of fear,
otherwise, they'll come up against me.

88
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,549
They need a little lesson, don't they?

89
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:10,179
<i>And that is an example
of how Lenny works.</i>

90
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:20,663
<i>Now, today is Lenny's big day.</i>

91
00:05:20,835 --> 00:05:21,927
<i>He's hit the big time...</i>

92
00:05:22,103 --> 00:05:25,971
<i>...because a new Russian billionaire
desires Lenny's property contacts.</i>

93
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:29,008
<i>He wants planning permission
where the law won't allow.</i>

94
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:30,576
Lenny Cole is here.

95
00:05:30,745 --> 00:05:32,440
<i>Lenny will come through...</i>

96
00:05:32,614 --> 00:05:35,742
<i>...but he will rape that Russian
for every ruble he can get.</i>

97
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:37,179
Nice to see you, Uri.

98
00:05:37,352 --> 00:05:40,048
Good. Come and take a seat.

99
00:05:40,588 --> 00:05:44,183
Excuse me if I am hasty,
but I have a busy day.

100
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:46,327
- Oh, that's all right.
- Sit.

101
00:05:48,263 --> 00:05:52,131
I can see we are very much alike,
you and I, Lenny.

102
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,734
We like to get things done.

103
00:05:55,704 --> 00:05:57,137
What's it going to cost me?

104
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:02,269
First, let me make it clear exactly
how we can help you benefit from this deal.

105
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:04,639
Without me,
you'd be waiting five to 10 years...

106
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:07,714
...before you got permission
to erect your arena.

107
00:06:07,882 --> 00:06:10,146
Secondly, with British law
as it so stands...

108
00:06:10,318 --> 00:06:12,513
Lenny, how much?

109
00:06:16,257 --> 00:06:17,690
Seven million euros.

110
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:27,495
I expect the guarantee that I have consent
within six months and no red tape.

111
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:28,966
Oh, you got it.

112
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:30,297
Consider it done.

113
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:33,802
- Drink?
- Yeah.

114
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:40,644
That's a nice painting, Uri.

115
00:06:41,282 --> 00:06:43,113
It's got depth, you know.

116
00:06:43,284 --> 00:06:45,752
That picture has brought me nothing
but luck, Lenny.

117
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,944
It's my lucky picture.

118
00:06:47,122 --> 00:06:48,749
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

119
00:06:49,157 --> 00:06:50,283
You like?

120
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,050
Yeah.

121
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:54,495
Take it for a while.

122
00:06:54,662 --> 00:06:55,959
Maybe it will give you luck.

123
00:06:56,131 --> 00:06:58,964
Oh, no, Uri, I... You know, I couldn't.

124
00:06:59,134 --> 00:07:01,568
We are partners now, I insist.

125
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:04,136
I will get it sent around to your house.

126
00:07:04,305 --> 00:07:07,672
You can give it back to me
when our deal's finalized.

127
00:07:07,842 --> 00:07:08,968
Hm?

128
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:12,711
Well, I thought you lot drank vodka.

129
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:15,179
Whiskey is the new vodka.

130
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,908
You're not joining me?

131
00:07:17,085 --> 00:07:18,882
I don't drink.

132
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:24,651
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

133
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:36,094
- You all right, Len?
- Yeah.

134
00:07:36,271 --> 00:07:38,569
Because you're looking a bit pink.

135
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:42,536
Get us some water
and a wet wipe live-o, will you, Turbo?

136
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,109
Right away, Len.

137
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:47,271
He tried to poison me, the dirty Cossack.

138
00:07:47,615 --> 00:07:50,311
Look, stop messing about,
just give me the bottle.

139
00:07:50,485 --> 00:07:52,077
Sorry, Len.

140
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:53,743
How is the billionaires club?

141
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:57,781
Well, I tell you what, this Communism
didn't slow him down, did it?

142
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:00,052
I'll tell you what, Arch.

143
00:08:00,562 --> 00:08:02,860
We've hit the big time here.

144
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:06,927
Well, what's wrong?
Where's the famous Archy smile?

145
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:10,662
You gotta watch yourself with this lot.
I mean, times are changing.

146
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:13,672
- They ain't no respecters of the old school.
- Oh, bollocks.

147
00:08:13,842 --> 00:08:17,608
There's no school like the old school,
and I'm the fucking headmaster.

148
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:19,508
That's why he come to me.

149
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:21,171
Got it?

150
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,880
Yeah, got it.

151
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:30,057
You think you should have lent him
your lucky picture?

152
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:32,591
It makes the peasant feel royal.

153
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,854
Don't spoil it,
we need him at the moment.

154
00:08:36,197 --> 00:08:37,528
I want that consent.

155
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:40,099
Call the accountant
and get her to clear the money.

156
00:08:40,268 --> 00:08:43,999
<i>If Uri's gonna turn over seven large ones
to grease Lenny's contacts...</i>

157
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:45,662
<i>...he's gonna need it in cash.</i>

158
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,968
<i>And for that,
he needs his personal accountant.</i>

159
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:53,877
<i>Meet the very gifted
and the financially creative Stella.</i>

160
00:08:54,048 --> 00:08:55,345
You know why you get deals?

161
00:08:55,517 --> 00:08:58,850
Because those sad, fat, old men like it
when you swear at them.

162
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,488
They shake like cocktails
and sweat like Semtex...

163
00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:03,749
...when you raise that posh, little voice.

164
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:07,591
You, my love, are a rare commodity.

165
00:09:08,596 --> 00:09:10,962
Now, come on, give your Bertie a smile.

166
00:09:11,132 --> 00:09:13,532
I don't feel like smiling.

167
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:17,034
I'm a 30-year-old accountant
married to a homosexual lawyer.

168
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:20,740
I'm a beard without kids, Bertie.

169
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:24,140
For a marriage of convenience,
this can be quite inconvenient.

170
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:29,914
<i>Stella, we need to talk.</i>

171
00:09:30,084 --> 00:09:31,847
Yes, she's right here.

172
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,385
It's Omovich.

173
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:34,817
You sure he isn't gay?

174
00:09:34,989 --> 00:09:36,889
<i>But what the Russian doesn't know...</i>

175
00:09:37,058 --> 00:09:40,391
<i>...is that his accountant
has got bored of the safe life...</i>

176
00:09:40,562 --> 00:09:45,124
<i>...and is looking for excitement
in all the wrong places.</i>

177
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,565
<i>Welcome to the Speeler.</i>

178
00:09:48,736 --> 00:09:52,194
<i>This hot little house of crime is home
to a particularly nefarious group...</i>

179
00:09:52,373 --> 00:09:55,399
<i>...of individuals known locally
as the Wild Bunch.</i>

180
00:09:55,577 --> 00:09:58,137
There's no way you're gonna get a five,
understand, Bob?

181
00:09:58,313 --> 00:10:01,180
- They've got nothing on you, son.
- What are you talking about?

182
00:10:01,349 --> 00:10:03,977
Fred, they've got a grass.
They've got an informer.

183
00:10:04,352 --> 00:10:08,049
Got a rat with a roach smoking a canary.
Got more information than the Internet.

184
00:10:08,222 --> 00:10:10,588
- All right, ladies.
- Cookie, how you doing, son?

185
00:10:10,758 --> 00:10:11,850
Cookie, do you want in?

186
00:10:12,026 --> 00:10:15,427
I did promise the twins
I'd take them fishing, but fuck it.

187
00:10:15,597 --> 00:10:19,693
- Throw us in for a quick spin.
- Hey, Mumbles, can I have a word?

188
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:21,568
No.

189
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,931
Mumbles, I'll make it worth your while.

190
00:10:26,107 --> 00:10:27,131
Coming, dear.

191
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:30,903
<i>But in the world of crime,
there's always coincidence.</i>

192
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:33,639
<i>And the very men she needs
to fuel her thrills...</i>

193
00:10:33,815 --> 00:10:36,716
<i>...are the very men
that owe Lenny two large ones.</i>

194
00:10:36,884 --> 00:10:38,647
What's happening?

195
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,220
You know that lady, the posh pup?

196
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:43,380
The one that likes a bit of the rough life?

197
00:10:43,558 --> 00:10:47,153
The little dangerous accountant.
You haven't heard from her in a little while.

198
00:10:47,328 --> 00:10:49,353
- I know.
- Well?

199
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,794
Well, she's offered us
a bit of work, right?

200
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:54,594
But, I mean, like, proper work.

201
00:10:56,137 --> 00:11:01,541
Now, normally, I would just turn her down,
but considering our current situation...

202
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:02,733
Let's have a meet.

203
00:11:17,492 --> 00:11:21,724
I've got one just like that at home,
but with a little boy fishing.

204
00:11:22,163 --> 00:11:25,030
Is that what they call humor
where you come from?

205
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,965
Is that what they call art
where you come from?

206
00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:33,403
You are quite the entertainer,
Mr. One Two.

207
00:11:33,574 --> 00:11:35,769
And you're also late.

208
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,940
Please, don't be late.

209
00:11:46,354 --> 00:11:48,754
I've got some work,
thought you might be interested.

210
00:11:48,923 --> 00:11:50,652
Go on.

211
00:11:50,992 --> 00:11:55,156
There are two accountants taking out
7 million euros from a bank I know.

212
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:57,627
And it won't be protected.

213
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:00,063
Twenty percent for me, as normal.

214
00:12:00,234 --> 00:12:02,225
The details are in here.

215
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:04,868
Anything else?

216
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,063
Yeah.

217
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,142
I don't want this coming back to me,
so you could give them a black eye.

218
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:12,040
It might help.

219
00:12:12,647 --> 00:12:15,673
Just a black eye, nothing more.

220
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:19,512
Very well, Mrs. Baxter.

221
00:12:19,687 --> 00:12:21,655
A black eye it is, then.

222
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:28,453
Nice shoes, by the way.

223
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:30,153
Thank you.

224
00:12:30,331 --> 00:12:34,495
You'll be able to afford a pair of your own
in a couple of days.

225
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:44,968
"Troubled rock star, Johnny Quid,
is missing, presumed dead yesterday...

226
00:12:45,146 --> 00:12:48,172
...when he fell from the side of a yacht
thought to be owned...

227
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:51,750
...by a prominent high-street
fashion magnate."

228
00:12:53,755 --> 00:12:55,222
Sorry, I don't know what to say.

229
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:59,723
Yeah, well, I bet he took a few people
with him in his hot little crack pipe.

230
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:07,224
We will never mention this again,
all right, Arch?

231
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:13,603
Look, tell the Councillor
to stop fucking about...

232
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:16,903
...with his little bat and balls
and send him inside.

233
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:23,076
Oh, that is sensational, Councillor.

234
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:25,815
Did you have lessons as a boy?

235
00:13:26,187 --> 00:13:28,018
Fancy a cool down?

236
00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:30,316
Bit of a chat with Lenny?

237
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:35,220
- You know Jackie?
- No.

238
00:13:35,396 --> 00:13:37,887
No, Archy, please, don't say anything.

239
00:13:38,065 --> 00:13:41,796
Don't you worry about her.
She's a very good friend of mine.

240
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:43,603
And a member.

241
00:13:43,771 --> 00:13:44,795
Oi, Jackie.

242
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:48,334
You fancy a runaround
with the Councillor?

243
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:50,602
Only if he's wicked.

244
00:13:53,648 --> 00:13:55,878
What does she mean by that?

245
00:13:56,818 --> 00:13:59,446
What would you like her to mean by that,
Councillor?

246
00:14:02,623 --> 00:14:04,090
Come on.

247
00:14:04,725 --> 00:14:07,159
There we are, plans and papers.

248
00:14:07,328 --> 00:14:10,855
<i>When you're in bed with Len,
he likes to sweeten a cash deal.</i>

249
00:14:11,032 --> 00:14:13,296
Would you like a cigar?

250
00:14:14,068 --> 00:14:15,126
I don't mind if I do.

251
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:21,242
<i>He wants you sitting in the front row
with a new car sitting in your driveway.</i>

252
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:25,038
<i>Len's skill lies in his ability
to know where your back needs scratching.</i>

253
00:14:25,213 --> 00:14:27,340
That's a nice lighter.

254
00:14:28,115 --> 00:14:31,642
Eight grand they wanted for it,
the greedy toads.

255
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:33,377
And I paid it.

256
00:14:33,554 --> 00:14:34,953
You know why?

257
00:14:35,122 --> 00:14:36,885
Tell me, Lenny.

258
00:14:37,491 --> 00:14:39,925
It's all about the details.

259
00:14:41,262 --> 00:14:44,459
Is our little deal in there too?

260
00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:46,096
<i>Look at Lenny.</i>

261
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:49,100
<i>Fucking playing with himself,
he's so proud.</i>

262
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,602
<i>He only paid a hundred pounds
for that lighter...</i>

263
00:14:51,772 --> 00:14:54,570
<i>...he's making the Councillor sweat
like he stole it himself.</i>

264
00:14:54,742 --> 00:14:56,539
I wouldn't forget about that.

265
00:14:56,978 --> 00:14:58,275
The important things first.

266
00:14:58,446 --> 00:15:02,348
<i>You got to hand it to Len,
because he ain't half a naughty bastard.</i>

267
00:15:02,516 --> 00:15:04,245
I'll leave that with you.

268
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:07,854
<i>Now, the Councillor just needs a few hours
with a right rotten tart...</i>

269
00:15:08,022 --> 00:15:09,887
Can't stay here chewing the fat all day.

270
00:15:10,057 --> 00:15:11,752
Man's got a living to make.

271
00:15:11,926 --> 00:15:13,518
I'll phone you in tomorrow.

272
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:16,458
<i>...and he'll be in there like swimwear.</i>

273
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:18,392
Take care of him, Jackie.

274
00:15:18,566 --> 00:15:21,399
Lenny, you forgot your lighter.

275
00:15:21,869 --> 00:15:22,961
No, it can't be mine.

276
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:26,467
It's got your name on it.

277
00:15:28,776 --> 00:15:29,800
All right.

278
00:15:29,977 --> 00:15:32,468
<i>Nothing's gonna stop Lenny
from his big Russian deal.</i>

279
00:15:33,814 --> 00:15:36,248
Yeah, I knew he'd like the lighter.

280
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:38,214
It was a nice touch, wasn't it?

281
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:41,844
Yeah, she's a good girl, Jackie.
You give her another drink.

282
00:15:42,623 --> 00:15:43,920
Yeah, you're right.

283
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:46,855
He wouldn't give me
his favorite painting, would he...

284
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:49,292
...if he didn't mean business?

285
00:15:49,463 --> 00:15:54,833
Yeah, I've took it off the easel,
and I've put it on the wall.

286
00:15:55,002 --> 00:15:56,663
Yeah, it looks mag...

287
00:15:56,837 --> 00:15:58,327
Archy, I've been... Fuck.

288
00:15:58,506 --> 00:15:59,598
Oh, fuck.

289
00:15:59,774 --> 00:16:01,332
Archy?

290
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:03,943
Archy, I've been robbed.

291
00:16:04,111 --> 00:16:05,544
<i>What?</i>

292
00:16:05,947 --> 00:16:07,505
<i>Hello?</i>

293
00:16:08,082 --> 00:16:10,141
I said, I've been robbed.

294
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:12,752
Yeah... I don't know when.

295
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,944
It's the painting.

296
00:16:14,989 --> 00:16:18,288
Yeah, it's the one that Uri gave me.

297
00:16:18,592 --> 00:16:21,288
All right, loaned, for fuck's sake.

298
00:16:23,898 --> 00:16:26,696
Archy, this is not good.

299
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:29,097
That's his favorite painting.

300
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,103
His lucky painting.

301
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,339
Yeah, all right.

302
00:16:34,508 --> 00:16:37,909
Come around here and bring the troops.

303
00:16:38,346 --> 00:16:39,335
Yeah.

304
00:16:39,513 --> 00:16:42,141
<i>Oh, fuck it, this isn't what I want to hear.</i>

305
00:16:42,316 --> 00:16:45,376
<i>When Lenny's wheels come off,
he's no good to anyone.</i>

306
00:16:45,553 --> 00:16:47,544
<i>Now, he's gonna stick it
straight on my lap.</i>

307
00:16:47,722 --> 00:16:51,590
<i>And Archy is gonna have to go to work.</i>

308
00:16:54,061 --> 00:16:55,119
Where was it, Len?

309
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:03,265
Well, let's just take a wild stab in
the dark, shall we, Bandy?

310
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:07,634
Archy, slap him, send him to school
because I can't take no more of this.

311
00:17:07,808 --> 00:17:09,070
Now, you sort this out.

312
00:17:09,243 --> 00:17:14,647
Get that painting back, bring me a body,
because I'm going to back to bed.

313
00:17:19,854 --> 00:17:24,086
Bandy, you ever ask a stupid question
like that again, you see Danny there?

314
00:17:24,258 --> 00:17:25,282
He's gonna slap you.

315
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:28,627
I'm sorry, Arch.
I was just trying to use initiative.

316
00:17:28,796 --> 00:17:30,559
Danny, slap him.

317
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:36,462
With the right, Danny, properly.

318
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:41,841
No, no, no, come on, do it properly
with the back of the right hand.

319
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:45,172
- What is this, a tennis match, Arch?
- Slap him.

320
00:17:47,782 --> 00:17:50,649
Oh, for fuck...

321
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:54,985
Like this.

322
00:17:55,656 --> 00:17:58,181
Now, if you can master a slap like that...

323
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:01,123
...there's no need for your clients
to hold back.

324
00:18:01,295 --> 00:18:04,890
They will open up
like a fountain full of words.

325
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:07,991
No need for strong violence, no, no.

326
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:11,036
They're transported
back to their childhood.

327
00:18:11,472 --> 00:18:12,871
Putty in your hands.

328
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,769
Ask Bandy.

329
00:18:15,076 --> 00:18:17,169
Look, thinks he's back at school.

330
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:19,843
But he never went to school, Arch.

331
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:24,012
You want a slap as well, Daniel, eh?

332
00:18:24,552 --> 00:18:28,648
Now, if the slap don't work,
you cut them or you pay them...

333
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:31,485
...but keep your receipts
because this ain't the Mafia.

334
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:34,287
Now, get out there, look for the painting.

335
00:18:47,808 --> 00:18:49,207
- Hello.
- Hi.

336
00:18:49,376 --> 00:18:50,400
Bye.

337
00:18:50,578 --> 00:18:53,513
If you just put the bags in the car,
close the door, walk away.

338
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:56,874
Ahem. Now, now, boys, do as you're told.

339
00:18:57,051 --> 00:19:00,509
Put the bags in the car,
walk away and keep smiling.

340
00:19:01,122 --> 00:19:04,057
Sorry, is this a robbery?

341
00:19:04,492 --> 00:19:06,892
Yes, it is a robbery. Now, fuck off.

342
00:19:07,294 --> 00:19:08,454
Thank you.

343
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:15,797
- Very good, Mr. One Two.
- Thank you very much, Mr. Mumbles.

344
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,838
Yeah, give me the keys.

345
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:29,312
Thanks.

346
00:19:30,184 --> 00:19:32,152
Yeah, very funny.

347
00:19:45,132 --> 00:19:46,121
Oi.

348
00:19:47,735 --> 00:19:49,134
Where's reverse?

349
00:19:49,303 --> 00:19:51,863
You have to lift up the knob
under the...

350
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:54,507
- Gear stick.
- Ah.

351
00:19:55,643 --> 00:19:57,736
Oh, yeah. Now, fuck off.

352
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:21,327
I know an electrician
that could copy one of those for you.

353
00:20:23,804 --> 00:20:25,795
Might take him
a couple of minutes, mind.

354
00:20:26,607 --> 00:20:28,871
Welcome to the nouveau riche,
Mr. One Two.

355
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:31,369
Here's one for you too, Mrs. Baxter.

356
00:20:31,545 --> 00:20:33,775
<i>Mm, trés chic.</i>

357
00:20:38,085 --> 00:20:41,577
It's a little bit heavier
than it looks on a calculator, isn't it?

358
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,151
I see you didn't think
much of the black eye.

359
00:20:45,326 --> 00:20:46,918
I would like to have obliged.

360
00:20:47,094 --> 00:20:50,791
But from a professional point of view,
just didn't seem natural.

361
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:54,867
- Mm.
- Until the next time?

362
00:20:57,071 --> 00:20:58,698
Maybe.

363
00:21:10,384 --> 00:21:13,911
The development has been underway
for four years...

364
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:17,615
...and will be completed
within another two.

365
00:21:18,626 --> 00:21:20,355
The area covers 12 acres...

366
00:21:20,527 --> 00:21:23,553
...and it will become one
of London's premier residences.

367
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:28,665
Excuse me, gentlemen.

368
00:21:32,506 --> 00:21:34,133
What is it?

369
00:21:56,897 --> 00:21:58,922
Victor, Victor.

370
00:22:11,545 --> 00:22:13,638
<i>- Yo, Archy.
- One Two.</i>

371
00:22:13,814 --> 00:22:15,441
Hey, I got Lenny's bit of scratch.

372
00:22:15,616 --> 00:22:16,708
What, you got all of it?

373
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:20,615
Yes, it's burning a hole in the floor,
so come get it before it melts my boots.

374
00:22:20,788 --> 00:22:22,119
I'll come down to Speeler.

375
00:22:23,457 --> 00:22:24,719
Hold on.

376
00:22:24,892 --> 00:22:27,588
Gotta go, got another call. Len?

377
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:30,457
Archy, the Russian didn't come through
with the money.

378
00:22:30,631 --> 00:22:32,826
<i>Don't worry about that,
the Councillor can wait.</i>

379
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,331
<i>I got some good news for you.</i>

380
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:37,299
<i>One Two and Co. have
come through with the scratch.</i>

381
00:22:37,638 --> 00:22:39,868
- What, all of it?
- So they say.

382
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,564
<i>Where'd they get that from, then?</i>

383
00:22:41,742 --> 00:22:43,835
No idea.
Ask no questions, you'd hear no lies.

384
00:22:44,011 --> 00:22:46,275
Listen, all I gotta do now
is find your painting.

385
00:22:46,447 --> 00:22:47,846
Yeah, well, make sure you do find it.

386
00:22:49,183 --> 00:22:51,208
Oh, look, I've gotta go.
There's another call.

387
00:22:51,385 --> 00:22:52,374
Hello?

388
00:22:52,553 --> 00:22:55,021
I have all my people waiting, Lenny.
You can't let me down.

389
00:22:55,189 --> 00:22:58,022
It's a delay.
That's all, Councillor, just a delay.

390
00:22:59,093 --> 00:23:00,651
Well, get back to me soon.

391
00:23:00,828 --> 00:23:02,557
Yeah, of course.

392
00:23:04,198 --> 00:23:05,495
Wanker.

393
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:10,134
I shook your hand, I've nicked your
rings. You didn't know that, did you?

394
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:12,902
Yes, that's right.

395
00:23:15,576 --> 00:23:18,340
- I can't. Tell you what I'll do, I give
you 50. - Gary.

396
00:23:19,413 --> 00:23:20,437
See you.

397
00:23:20,614 --> 00:23:21,740
- Hello, Archy.
- Hello.

398
00:23:21,915 --> 00:23:23,507
Come over here.

399
00:23:24,718 --> 00:23:26,481
Hello, Arch.
What brings you down here?

400
00:23:26,653 --> 00:23:27,847
What do you want, tickets?

401
00:23:28,021 --> 00:23:29,648
I want the Tank.

402
00:23:29,823 --> 00:23:33,281
Right. Well, you won't see him
on the cobbles, not this time of night.

403
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:38,056
He don't like the cold, see?
He's at the end of that street there.

404
00:23:38,232 --> 00:23:40,666
<i>Tank runs
the biggest ticket-tout organization...</i>

405
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:42,165
<i>...in the West End of London.</i>

406
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:45,794
<i>He knows more about what moves
on the streets than the rats themselves.</i>

407
00:23:45,973 --> 00:23:50,205
<i>Tank is a fortified world
of disgusting information.</i>

408
00:23:50,377 --> 00:23:52,971
- A word.
- Hello, Arch, what are you doing here?

409
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,011
I need a word.

410
00:23:55,182 --> 00:23:57,150
Don't stand out there
on the cobbles.

411
00:23:57,317 --> 00:23:58,341
Step into my world.

412
00:24:04,992 --> 00:24:07,790
<i>Well, perhaps the birds and the...</i>

413
00:24:07,961 --> 00:24:09,861
Great movie this, Arch.

414
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,930
They've had it redone.

415
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,268
Glorious picture.

416
00:24:15,702 --> 00:24:18,933
And the sound, well, it's exquisite.

417
00:24:20,007 --> 00:24:22,498
Could you turn it down a bit
so we could have a word?

418
00:24:22,676 --> 00:24:24,109
Oh, where are my manners?

419
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:26,109
Sorry, Arch.
What do you want, tickets?

420
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,010
Don't want tickets.
I'm looking for a painting.

421
00:24:29,183 --> 00:24:31,617
A classic painting,
been nicked out of Lenny's house.

422
00:24:31,785 --> 00:24:35,482
You got more feet on the street than
coppers on the beat, so I want you to help.

423
00:24:35,656 --> 00:24:39,422
I'll tell you what,
I'll leave you a little livener.

424
00:24:39,593 --> 00:24:42,221
Here's a couple of large
to get some tongues wagging.

425
00:24:44,998 --> 00:24:47,228
<i>- Yeah.
- Master, are you Fred?</i>

426
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:48,629
It is Fred.

427
00:24:48,802 --> 00:24:51,066
<i>For years,
there's been a well-hidden informer...</i>

428
00:24:51,238 --> 00:24:53,900
<i>...that's sent us all down
at one point or another.</i>

429
00:24:54,074 --> 00:24:57,874
<i>And now Bob is looking
at a five-stretch due to this grass.</i>

430
00:24:59,112 --> 00:25:02,775
So, tell me, Handsome,
your mom can't be very happy.

431
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,747
Not with you getting a five-stretch.

432
00:25:04,918 --> 00:25:07,386
Please, Fred, please, not again, yeah?

433
00:25:08,455 --> 00:25:10,889
I'm sorry, Bob.
You know I don't mean to offend.

434
00:25:11,058 --> 00:25:13,356
<i>But what makes the situation worse...</i>

435
00:25:13,527 --> 00:25:18,897
<i>...is everybody knows this dirty fucking rat
is still lurking somewhere among us.</i>

436
00:25:19,066 --> 00:25:21,091
Evening, gentlemen.

437
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:24,294
Oh, lovely hat, Fred, lovely.

438
00:25:24,471 --> 00:25:26,837
Who gives a fuck what you think?

439
00:25:27,007 --> 00:25:28,941
Okay, gentlemen, let's go.

440
00:25:29,977 --> 00:25:34,073
First, my colleague Paul
will be modeling the gray wolf.

441
00:25:34,882 --> 00:25:37,646
I must apologize
for my assistant's handicaps.

442
00:25:37,818 --> 00:25:41,686
He has unusually long arms
and an alarmingly small neck.

443
00:25:41,855 --> 00:25:44,119
I agree it doesn't seem
the right time of year...

444
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:47,920
...to be acquiring a coat
with such thermal efficiency.

445
00:25:48,095 --> 00:25:49,722
It is the middle of fucking summer.

446
00:25:49,897 --> 00:25:52,627
However,
Christmas is always around the corner.

447
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,460
Where did you get these junkies, eh?

448
00:25:54,635 --> 00:25:56,227
What's this, a fucking double act?

449
00:25:56,403 --> 00:25:59,463
Get on with it,
give us the price and then leave.

450
00:25:59,806 --> 00:26:03,037
All in good time, gentlemen,
all in good time.

451
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,042
Next up,
we have a very much sought-after affair...

452
00:26:06,213 --> 00:26:09,944
...seen in very, very glossy magazines.

453
00:26:10,484 --> 00:26:15,114
<i>Junkies, as any junkie will tell you,
are not to be trusted.</i>

454
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:18,816
<i>They take what doesn't belong to them,
not because they're thinking...</i>

455
00:26:18,992 --> 00:26:20,459
<i>...but because they're junkies.</i>

456
00:26:20,627 --> 00:26:22,652
What? It's only fire.

457
00:26:22,829 --> 00:26:25,161
<i>Selling stolen fur coats
in the middle of summer...</i>

458
00:26:25,332 --> 00:26:27,892
<i>...would not seem peculiar
to the average junkie mind.</i>

459
00:26:29,403 --> 00:26:32,372
The famous but rare black bear.

460
00:26:33,707 --> 00:26:36,540
Found in the dark mountains
of Siberian Calcutta.

461
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,803
Get an eyeful of that stripe,
gentlemen, eh?

462
00:26:38,979 --> 00:26:42,278
Oh, have a look,
it's a 6-foot skunk, isn't it?

463
00:26:43,684 --> 00:26:48,018
And all of this could be yours
for the staggeringly low...

464
00:26:48,221 --> 00:26:49,688
<i>- Yeah, hello.
- It's Archy.</i>

465
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:51,551
<i>- Hello, Arch, come up.
- Open up.</i>

466
00:26:51,725 --> 00:26:54,751
Come up, son.
Right, you two, out of here, live-o.

467
00:26:54,928 --> 00:26:56,691
Come on, back door, fuck off.

468
00:26:56,863 --> 00:26:59,263
<i>The Wild Bunch have had to put
extra money on top...</i>

469
00:26:59,433 --> 00:27:00,957
<i>...to ignite Lenny's contacts.</i>

470
00:27:01,134 --> 00:27:03,728
<i>And maybe, just maybe,
Lenny's magic wand...</i>

471
00:27:03,904 --> 00:27:08,102
<i>...can make Bob's legal paperwork
mysteriously disappear.</i>

472
00:27:08,275 --> 00:27:09,799
You all right, Fred?

473
00:27:09,977 --> 00:27:11,205
Arch.

474
00:27:11,378 --> 00:27:12,538
Mumbles.

475
00:27:12,713 --> 00:27:14,237
Arch.

476
00:27:14,581 --> 00:27:16,879
- Bob.
- Yeah, Archy.

477
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,278
One Two.

478
00:27:18,452 --> 00:27:19,942
Arch.

479
00:27:20,387 --> 00:27:22,355
I see you brought
your biggest gorilla with you.

480
00:27:24,057 --> 00:27:26,025
That's very unkind.

481
00:27:26,893 --> 00:27:28,918
You wanna be careful, One Two.

482
00:27:29,096 --> 00:27:31,929
You don't wanna catch another cold,
do you?

483
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:36,329
Speeler's a bit quiet today, Fred.

484
00:27:36,503 --> 00:27:37,527
Everything all right?

485
00:27:37,704 --> 00:27:39,695
It's good as gold, thanks, good as gold.

486
00:27:39,873 --> 00:27:41,306
Good.

487
00:27:44,044 --> 00:27:46,205
So come on, where is it?

488
00:27:46,813 --> 00:27:48,940
What, can't you smell it?

489
00:27:49,783 --> 00:27:50,943
No, I can't.

490
00:27:58,492 --> 00:28:00,119
Look at that, we could make a team.

491
00:28:00,293 --> 00:28:02,523
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Arch?

492
00:28:03,063 --> 00:28:05,531
Oh, by the way, this is for you.

493
00:28:05,699 --> 00:28:08,395
You buy yourself a new pair
of football boots or something.

494
00:28:08,568 --> 00:28:10,058
Really?

495
00:28:10,237 --> 00:28:13,035
You ain't half a funny bastard, ain't you?

496
00:28:14,107 --> 00:28:15,836
Good night, ladies.

497
00:28:18,945 --> 00:28:22,608
They say there are only two days
you enjoy a boat.

498
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:26,109
The day you buy it
and the day you sell it.

499
00:28:26,887 --> 00:28:29,151
According to my figures,
that sounds about right.

500
00:28:29,322 --> 00:28:30,755
What are you gonna do?

501
00:28:30,924 --> 00:28:32,687
Beauty is a cruel mistress.

502
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:34,588
I must remember that line.

503
00:28:34,761 --> 00:28:36,251
Be my guest.

504
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,955
- Can I pour you a glass?
- No.

505
00:28:39,132 --> 00:28:40,258
Thank you.

506
00:28:41,501 --> 00:28:42,525
You know, I like you.

507
00:28:44,237 --> 00:28:45,670
I like the way you are.

508
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,707
Always thinking about business,
very professional.

509
00:28:50,777 --> 00:28:53,439
Well, that's what you pay me to be,
isn't it?

510
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,277
Tell me about your husband.

511
00:28:57,684 --> 00:28:58,981
My husband is a lawyer.

512
00:28:59,152 --> 00:29:01,143
I hear he's very good at what he does.

513
00:29:01,855 --> 00:29:03,823
Maybe we can have some work for him.

514
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,222
Tell me, what do you do for fun?

515
00:29:12,966 --> 00:29:14,456
Have I offended you in some way?

516
00:29:15,635 --> 00:29:18,035
As you said, I'm a professional,
you're my employer.

517
00:29:18,205 --> 00:29:21,402
So as long as it stays that way,
why would I be offended?

518
00:29:23,276 --> 00:29:26,677
You see, Victor?
This is what I am talking about.

519
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,207
This is what I like about this country.

520
00:29:29,382 --> 00:29:30,576
They understand hierarchy.

521
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:34,243
You do your job, I do mine,
and everyone gets along.

522
00:29:34,821 --> 00:29:36,880
Now, back to business.

523
00:29:37,691 --> 00:29:39,215
We have had security problems.

524
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,691
And to cut a long story short...

525
00:29:42,362 --> 00:29:45,889
...I need another 7 million euros
lost in the books.

526
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,334
Mr. Omovich, I'm the best at what I do.

527
00:29:50,504 --> 00:29:52,335
I could certainly cover
some of that money...

528
00:29:52,506 --> 00:29:53,530
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

529
00:29:53,707 --> 00:29:56,335
...but even I can't hide 7 million
from the tax man.

530
00:29:57,944 --> 00:29:59,639
But if you are so good...

531
00:29:59,813 --> 00:30:01,542
You devil.

532
00:30:01,715 --> 00:30:02,875
Let me think about it.

533
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:06,214
There are some options
I've tried to leave open.

534
00:30:08,388 --> 00:30:09,980
Thank you.

535
00:30:26,873 --> 00:30:30,866
- Come on, Bobby boy, cheer up.
- What have I got to cheer up about?

536
00:30:31,044 --> 00:30:33,171
I'll be locked up in an 8-by-10
tomorrow night.

537
00:30:33,346 --> 00:30:37,715
Bob, that's tomorrow night, okay?
So tonight is takeoff time.

538
00:30:38,318 --> 00:30:41,481
And we have got a party
planned for you, my man.

539
00:30:41,655 --> 00:30:44,556
We got a couple of grams of hurry up
and four Jack the Rippers.

540
00:30:44,724 --> 00:30:46,419
We've got the Harris twins.

541
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,887
Probably the most expensive escort girls
ever to have escorted.

542
00:30:51,064 --> 00:30:52,827
Got the night off from the Russians...

543
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:56,435
...and they have been greased down
just for the Bobski.

544
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,656
Okay, well, I see that cheered you up.

545
00:31:02,657 --> 00:31:04,772
It's not that I'm not
grateful, it's just...

546
00:31:07,547 --> 00:31:08,571
What? It's just what?

547
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:10,741
You wouldn't understand.

548
00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:12,942
Come on, Bobby boy, that's not fair.

549
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,950
I'd understand anything
coming from you.

550
00:31:17,858 --> 00:31:19,325
Would you?

551
00:31:20,293 --> 00:31:21,954
Bob, you're my best mate.

552
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,163
You see, I don't want the strippers,
One Two.

553
00:31:30,136 --> 00:31:31,603
Okay.

554
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:34,102
I want you.

555
00:31:45,585 --> 00:31:47,644
Dirty bastard.

556
00:31:53,226 --> 00:31:54,488
You dirty bastard.

557
00:31:57,364 --> 00:31:59,491
Bob, I know all your girlfriends,
all of them.

558
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:02,226
I told you, you wouldn't understand.

559
00:32:02,402 --> 00:32:04,962
What, I wouldn't understand
that you're a fucking homo?

560
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:07,297
You're Handsome Bob.

561
00:32:07,474 --> 00:32:10,875
You're Handsome Bob,
the fucking lady-killer, that's who you are.

562
00:32:11,044 --> 00:32:12,568
Do you hear me, Bob?

563
00:32:12,746 --> 00:32:15,977
I mean, I've had showers with you, man.
You've seen my fucking cock.

564
00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:17,912
I should have just kept my mouth shut.

565
00:32:18,084 --> 00:32:20,143
Right, you should have kept
your mouth shut.

566
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,584
We should've just gone
and done the strippers...

567
00:32:22,756 --> 00:32:24,383
...like Handsome Bob would've done.

568
00:32:24,557 --> 00:32:26,889
You should drown the cat
instead of letting it out.

569
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,052
No, no, not you. Not fag Bob.

570
00:32:47,614 --> 00:32:50,913
I am so sorry.

571
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,244
Well, I'm sorry.

572
00:32:55,422 --> 00:32:56,980
No, I'm sorry.

573
00:32:57,157 --> 00:32:59,216
- No, I'm sorry.
- No, no, I'm sorry.

574
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:02,088
No, I'm fucking sorry, Bob, all right?

575
00:33:02,262 --> 00:33:04,492
I went over the top a bit.

576
00:33:04,664 --> 00:33:07,292
And it was a bit
of a fucking surprise, Bob.

577
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:09,731
It was a bit of a broadside.

578
00:33:09,903 --> 00:33:11,564
It's fine. It's fine.

579
00:33:14,841 --> 00:33:17,332
Five years, you know.

580
00:33:18,011 --> 00:33:20,639
I don't know if I can handle it.

581
00:33:25,518 --> 00:33:28,749
I don't know what I was thinking, Bob.

582
00:33:29,189 --> 00:33:33,285
I mean, there's nothing wrong
with being a poof or being a gay...

583
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,328
...or whatever it is you call it,
I don't know.

584
00:33:37,998 --> 00:33:41,729
I mean, there's gonna be plenty
of your lot in there.

585
00:33:42,035 --> 00:33:44,003
You'll probably love it.

586
00:33:46,172 --> 00:33:48,163
Oh, God.

587
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,845
What...?

588
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:57,845
What exactly is it that you...?

589
00:33:58,785 --> 00:34:02,721
That you wanna do to me, then, Bob?

590
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:07,156
Tank, come in.

591
00:34:09,062 --> 00:34:10,086
You want a drink?

592
00:34:10,263 --> 00:34:13,858
No, thanks, Archy.
Not till the sun's past the yard hour.

593
00:34:19,472 --> 00:34:23,101
Ooh. Nice office Lenny's got here, isn't it?

594
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:27,102
Like that,
Scandinavian pine posing as English oak.

595
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,180
Nice touch, that.

596
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:31,146
Ooh.

597
00:34:31,518 --> 00:34:33,645
- Whistler.
- Come again?

598
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:37,347
Nineteenth century,
Beaufort Hunt, master of hounds.

599
00:34:37,724 --> 00:34:38,748
Is that right?

600
00:34:38,925 --> 00:34:42,417
You know a man's cultured
when he's got a Whistler on the wall.

601
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,122
Go on.

602
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,437
Now, you know why they call me Tank,
don't you, Archy?

603
00:34:55,608 --> 00:34:57,838
It's because you're a dirty,
big black bastard.

604
00:34:58,011 --> 00:35:00,673
Think tank, Arch.

605
00:35:00,847 --> 00:35:02,712
Nothing gets past the old think tank.

606
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:04,607
Nothing.

607
00:35:05,585 --> 00:35:09,419
So I thought I'd fire a few questions
into the right direction.

608
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:13,491
Thought I'd come see you because it looks
like I got news about your painting.

609
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,560
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

610
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:19,355
Right, let me tell you how this works.

611
00:35:19,532 --> 00:35:22,695
You're going in the drink,
and I'm gonna have a cup of tea.

612
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:26,327
Beneath your feet
is the famous river Thames.

613
00:35:27,273 --> 00:35:29,741
I just hope for your sakes
you can hold your breath...

614
00:35:29,909 --> 00:35:32,070
...for as long as it takes
my kettle to boil.

615
00:35:32,245 --> 00:35:35,840
After that, I'm gonna ask you a question,
just one question.

616
00:35:36,015 --> 00:35:37,710
You're gonna give me a name.

617
00:35:37,884 --> 00:35:39,215
And if it's the right name...

618
00:35:39,385 --> 00:35:42,445
...I'm gonna send you home warm and dry
in a fresh set of clothes.

619
00:35:42,622 --> 00:35:47,116
If it's the wrong name,
you'll be fed to the crayfish.

620
00:35:47,293 --> 00:35:49,955
They're American, these crayfish.

621
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,222
Big, hungry bastards.

622
00:35:51,397 --> 00:35:54,389
And like most things American,
they've eaten the natives...

623
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:57,468
...but they've still got room for more.

624
00:35:57,637 --> 00:35:58,797
Show him one, Charlie.

625
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:04,343
All right, see you, enjoy.

626
00:36:06,045 --> 00:36:09,344
No, no, no. They got money.

627
00:36:09,516 --> 00:36:11,541
They stole the fucking money.

628
00:36:11,718 --> 00:36:14,380
I swear, I wouldn't fucking lie to you,
please.

629
00:36:14,554 --> 00:36:16,249
No, no, no.

630
00:36:16,422 --> 00:36:17,514
Oh, stop, stop.

631
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,681
No, don't.

632
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:23,295
The American crayfish
was introduced in the '20s.

633
00:36:23,463 --> 00:36:25,795
A guest, if you like.

634
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:30,160
And like most guests having a good time,
they didn't wanna leave.

635
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,803
Next 50 years...

636
00:36:31,971 --> 00:36:36,203
...they consumed all the local crayfish,
wiped them out.

637
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:42,106
And then, they started eating each other.

638
00:36:44,284 --> 00:36:47,048
That's the thing about greed, Arch.

639
00:36:47,387 --> 00:36:49,412
It's blind.

640
00:36:51,524 --> 00:36:53,822
And it doesn't know when to stop.

641
00:36:55,261 --> 00:36:57,320
That's why I'm here.

642
00:36:59,032 --> 00:37:00,863
To keep order.

643
00:37:01,868 --> 00:37:04,029
Danny, hose him down.

644
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:27,990
Right, who's got that painting?
One name.

645
00:37:28,494 --> 00:37:29,984
Johnny.

646
00:37:30,663 --> 00:37:31,687
Johnny Quid.

647
00:37:33,366 --> 00:37:36,631
The singer from the group,
the Quid Lickers.

648
00:37:36,803 --> 00:37:39,101
This hasn't worked, has it?

649
00:37:39,672 --> 00:37:42,573
- How can a dead man sell you a painting?
- No, he's not dead.

650
00:37:42,742 --> 00:37:46,405
He's not dead, he just tried selling us
that painting and he changed his mind.

651
00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:49,514
- He's got, like, an obsession with it.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

652
00:37:49,682 --> 00:37:51,650
Archy, put him back in
before I shoot him.

653
00:37:51,818 --> 00:37:54,446
No, please, I know who he is.
We went to school together.

654
00:37:54,621 --> 00:37:55,645
I wouldn't lie to you.

655
00:37:55,822 --> 00:37:58,017
I don't lie.
I've never lied in my life.

656
00:37:58,191 --> 00:38:00,489
Now, please just let me go.
I don't wanna get...

657
00:38:05,164 --> 00:38:06,927
Len, can I have a word?

658
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,261
I really wouldn't lie to you.

659
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,902
- Your boy ain't dead, is he?
- Don't you dare call him my boy.

660
00:38:19,078 --> 00:38:23,412
Oh, you know what I mean.
Your ex's boy, your stepson.

661
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,277
He had a set of keys to the house,
didn't he?

662
00:38:26,452 --> 00:38:29,012
He just won't fucking die,
that cockroach.

663
00:38:29,188 --> 00:38:32,521
That junkie's seen more funerals
than a fucking undertaker, he's poison.

664
00:38:32,692 --> 00:38:36,719
I tell you, the next world war
will have his name written all over it.

665
00:38:38,965 --> 00:38:40,990
Look, you go see...

666
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:45,160
...if you can find them two flash idiots
that used to be his manager.

667
00:38:45,338 --> 00:38:47,169
What are they called?

668
00:38:47,774 --> 00:38:49,105
Greek and Minnie?

669
00:38:49,275 --> 00:38:51,607
- Roman and Mickey.
- Yeah, whatever.

670
00:38:51,778 --> 00:38:55,805
Because if anybody can find
that smoking crack pipe, they can.

671
00:38:56,082 --> 00:38:59,210
No, you're not listening to what I'm saying.
That's exactly what I do.

672
00:38:59,385 --> 00:39:02,218
The dry ice, Mickey.
I need the fucking dry ice.

673
00:39:02,388 --> 00:39:04,151
My show just doesn't work without it.

674
00:39:04,324 --> 00:39:05,586
Hold on a second.

675
00:39:05,758 --> 00:39:08,454
If you would've asked me yesterday
for dry ice...

676
00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:11,188
...I would've got the driest ice
the world could find...

677
00:39:11,364 --> 00:39:12,763
...but you didn't ask me.

678
00:39:12,932 --> 00:39:15,924
You asked me for two cases
of Johnnie Walker Black Label...

679
00:39:16,102 --> 00:39:19,128
...and four ladies of the pole,
and I got them for you, didn't I?

680
00:39:19,305 --> 00:39:20,670
Yes.

681
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,603
Yes, you did, I do confess.

682
00:39:22,775 --> 00:39:28,736
But, Mickey, you are the manager,
I'm the rocker.

683
00:39:28,915 --> 00:39:32,407
You got on the hat.
Why don't you just pull something out of it?

684
00:39:32,585 --> 00:39:34,951
My hat is deep and full of magic.

685
00:39:35,121 --> 00:39:38,955
I got rabbits, handkerchiefs
and ladies of the pole drinking Black Label.

686
00:39:39,325 --> 00:39:41,486
I got smoke machines,
bubble machines...

687
00:39:41,661 --> 00:39:46,257
...I even got love marines,
and still the hat goes deeper.

688
00:39:46,866 --> 00:39:48,094
All right?

689
00:39:48,468 --> 00:39:50,936
But there ain't no motherfucking dry ice.

690
00:39:51,104 --> 00:39:52,731
Okay.

691
00:39:53,072 --> 00:39:54,869
You made your point.

692
00:39:55,508 --> 00:39:59,604
But tomorrow,
might be quite nice to have some dry ice.

693
00:40:02,215 --> 00:40:04,183
- You read this?
- What?

694
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:07,717
"Singer extraordinaire, Johnny Quid
fell off a boat," they said.

695
00:40:07,887 --> 00:40:10,617
" Missing, assumed dead," they say.

696
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,155
Our Johnny?

697
00:40:12,325 --> 00:40:16,284
How many rock stars by the name Johnny
Quid do you think there are in the universe?

698
00:40:16,462 --> 00:40:18,794
Only thing he fell off is his junkie spoon.

699
00:40:18,965 --> 00:40:21,456
He's no deader
than them shoes you got on.

700
00:40:21,634 --> 00:40:24,694
He'll be gearing himself up,
happy as a clam in a fisherman's net.

701
00:40:24,871 --> 00:40:26,270
June, how dead is Johnny?

702
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:28,964
If he's dead,
that's the third time this year.

703
00:40:30,243 --> 00:40:32,006
Rockers like that never die.

704
00:40:34,614 --> 00:40:37,344
They just wither and give me pain.

705
00:41:02,108 --> 00:41:04,804
Now, listen to me, boy. Listen.

706
00:41:04,977 --> 00:41:07,844
I never did like you,
neither did your real dad.

707
00:41:08,014 --> 00:41:09,038
You're a reject.

708
00:41:09,215 --> 00:41:12,912
A wrong and a fucking fairy in the mirror
that I inherited from your mom.

709
00:41:13,085 --> 00:41:15,849
But she ain't with us no more,
so it's just you and me.

710
00:41:16,022 --> 00:41:18,354
Now, next week,
you're going back to school.

711
00:41:18,524 --> 00:41:21,982
The most expensive fucking school
in this country, I might add.

712
00:41:22,161 --> 00:41:24,026
And then you'll be gone
for a whole term.

713
00:41:24,197 --> 00:41:29,658
In the meantime, show some gratitude
and keep the fucking music down.

714
00:42:18,985 --> 00:42:20,953
Go on, John.

715
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,781
Jog it on.

716
00:42:24,423 --> 00:42:26,323
I can't, Pete.

717
00:42:26,792 --> 00:42:28,453
The painting's got me.

718
00:42:28,628 --> 00:42:30,789
That's what art does to you, Pete.
It gets you.

719
00:42:30,963 --> 00:42:33,727
You'd get a good few notes for that.

720
00:42:34,967 --> 00:42:38,198
- You wouldn't understand.
- Why not?

721
00:42:38,371 --> 00:42:41,272
Because you are street scum, Pete.

722
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,466
You're in need of a good education.
That's what you need.

723
00:42:44,644 --> 00:42:46,976
But your dad
didn't give a shit about you, did he?

724
00:42:47,146 --> 00:42:49,011
And that's why you're on the gear.

725
00:42:49,181 --> 00:42:51,877
The gear is your surrogate father.

726
00:42:52,051 --> 00:42:55,509
Leave off, John.
What, is this shrink time?

727
00:42:56,956 --> 00:42:59,754
Come on, Pedro.

728
00:43:00,693 --> 00:43:04,823
I'm your sponsor, doctor.

729
00:43:04,997 --> 00:43:08,455
I'll be your dad if you feel
a bit of regression coming on.

730
00:43:09,068 --> 00:43:12,367
But first, we need a drink in our hands.

731
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:19,171
<i>My dad used to make me watch Bonanza
every Sunday after church.</i>

732
00:43:19,612 --> 00:43:21,637
Well, that's got
to have done some damage.

733
00:43:21,814 --> 00:43:25,045
- All those guns, nuns and cowboys.
- You think?

734
00:43:25,217 --> 00:43:26,650
It wasn't all bad.

735
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:28,582
He sometimes made me laugh too.

736
00:43:28,754 --> 00:43:30,881
Well, now we're onto something.

737
00:43:31,057 --> 00:43:32,752
Did he ever interfere with you?

738
00:43:33,259 --> 00:43:35,921
You know, touch you inappropriate-like.

739
00:43:36,495 --> 00:43:38,326
He tickled me, if that's what you mean.

740
00:43:38,497 --> 00:43:41,694
In psychological circles,
there's a technical term for that scenario.

741
00:43:42,101 --> 00:43:43,591
There is?

742
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:46,033
Monsteroustickalotis.

743
00:43:46,205 --> 00:43:47,729
You what?

744
00:43:48,174 --> 00:43:49,766
Your dad was a tickling monster.

745
00:43:51,577 --> 00:43:53,169
Oi, that's my drink.

746
00:43:53,946 --> 00:43:55,573
Fuck you, sing-along.

747
00:43:55,748 --> 00:43:57,773
You're no help,
and stop calling me Pedro.

748
00:43:58,184 --> 00:43:59,412
Oi.

749
00:44:01,654 --> 00:44:02,678
Come on then, boy.

750
00:44:02,855 --> 00:44:06,416
I'll have you and your girlfriends.
I'll do the lot of youse.

751
00:44:08,094 --> 00:44:10,790
Do I not look like a pothouse?
Six foot down the bar.

752
00:44:10,963 --> 00:44:14,626
Go on, jog on, walk on,
goodbye, bon voyage, fuck off.

753
00:44:20,373 --> 00:44:22,273
- Was I good or what, Pete?
- Yeah.

754
00:44:22,441 --> 00:44:24,102
It's all in the eyes.

755
00:44:24,276 --> 00:44:26,471
Junkies, I shit them.

756
00:44:39,759 --> 00:44:41,590
Roman, Mickey.

757
00:44:41,761 --> 00:44:46,494
I tried to stop them,
but they couldn't be stopped.

758
00:44:46,666 --> 00:44:49,760
- I think they just wanted...
- Just wanted to have a chat.

759
00:44:49,935 --> 00:44:51,869
I'm sorry, Mickey.

760
00:44:52,204 --> 00:44:54,604
Yeah, don't worry about it, June.

761
00:44:54,774 --> 00:44:56,765
Why don't you go have another lunch?

762
00:44:57,176 --> 00:44:59,576
Come over here, babe.
We can have it together.

763
00:45:00,613 --> 00:45:02,979
Yeah, sorry to intrude.

764
00:45:03,449 --> 00:45:05,349
They call this a litchi, don't they?

765
00:45:05,518 --> 00:45:06,815
Litchi.

766
00:45:06,986 --> 00:45:08,851
Litchi, litchi.

767
00:45:15,828 --> 00:45:17,159
Mm.

768
00:45:17,329 --> 00:45:19,923
It's tasty and exotic.

769
00:45:20,366 --> 00:45:21,458
A bit like your June.

770
00:45:23,202 --> 00:45:24,692
Thanks.

771
00:45:28,407 --> 00:45:29,669
Can we help you?

772
00:45:29,842 --> 00:45:32,106
Yeah. You got an act
called the Quid Lickers.

773
00:45:32,278 --> 00:45:34,246
We did, yeah.

774
00:45:39,351 --> 00:45:42,843
And there's a singer called Johnny Quid.

775
00:45:43,022 --> 00:45:44,649
There was.

776
00:45:44,824 --> 00:45:47,850
Well, I'd like to see Mr. Quid.

777
00:45:48,027 --> 00:45:50,757
I'd like to see him too,
but that's gonna be tricky.

778
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:52,261
According to the papers...

779
00:45:52,431 --> 00:45:55,059
...the only songs Mr. Quid's
gonna be singing are hymns.

780
00:45:55,234 --> 00:45:57,031
And I shed a tear.

781
00:45:57,203 --> 00:46:02,436
I shed a tear for all those bone tops
that read the papers and believe that shit.

782
00:46:02,908 --> 00:46:05,274
But did you see his body?

783
00:46:05,444 --> 00:46:07,435
Did you see him smacked up
and cracked up...

784
00:46:07,613 --> 00:46:10,309
...with his tongue on his chin
and his cock in his hand...

785
00:46:10,483 --> 00:46:13,111
...swinging from the rafters
like a real RocknRolla?

786
00:46:13,285 --> 00:46:14,912
No, you didn't, did you?

787
00:46:15,087 --> 00:46:17,681
And nobody else
fucking did either, did they?

788
00:46:17,857 --> 00:46:19,916
Because he ain't dead.

789
00:46:20,092 --> 00:46:23,687
He's alive, alive-o somewhere,
selling cockles and mussels...

790
00:46:23,863 --> 00:46:26,889
...and a very important painting
that doesn't belong to him.

791
00:46:28,033 --> 00:46:30,558
I'm sorry,
what does this have to do with us?

792
00:46:31,103 --> 00:46:35,437
You have 12 licenses
within a jurisdiction which I control.

793
00:46:35,608 --> 00:46:37,872
So if you wanna play on,
do what I tell you.

794
00:46:41,347 --> 00:46:43,315
I can tell what you're thinking now.

795
00:46:43,482 --> 00:46:45,177
Well, there's not much you can't do.

796
00:46:45,351 --> 00:46:47,717
Slow down, Tinkerbell.

797
00:46:49,789 --> 00:46:52,917
<i>You'll never sing the same
If your teeth ain't your own</i>

798
00:46:56,462 --> 00:46:59,727
Wait, so you guys
are gonna take care of him?

799
00:46:59,899 --> 00:47:02,231
What do you think we are, gangsters?

800
00:47:02,935 --> 00:47:04,266
That's not my style.

801
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:08,206
So do us all a favor
before you catch a cold.

802
00:47:14,413 --> 00:47:15,812
There he is.

803
00:47:16,282 --> 00:47:18,113
You were missed in court this morning.

804
00:47:18,284 --> 00:47:19,751
Not very compassionate, is it?

805
00:47:19,919 --> 00:47:22,080
Not turning up to your amigo's funeral.

806
00:47:22,454 --> 00:47:25,981
Yeah, everyone else was there,
except you.

807
00:47:26,425 --> 00:47:28,518
And I got the feeling
that the only person...

808
00:47:28,694 --> 00:47:31,925
...that Handsome
really wanted to see there was you.

809
00:47:34,466 --> 00:47:36,593
All right, well,
what are you saying, Fred?

810
00:47:36,769 --> 00:47:39,636
What the fuck are you getting at?
Come on, out with it.

811
00:47:39,805 --> 00:47:41,830
Whoa, leave it.

812
00:47:42,374 --> 00:47:44,638
We all know how much you loved Bob.

813
00:47:45,911 --> 00:47:48,573
What exactly do you mean, loved Bob?

814
00:47:49,215 --> 00:47:50,705
Guess who.

815
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,541
Prosecution lost the paperwork.
I'm offski.

816
00:47:53,719 --> 00:47:54,913
Case is closed.

817
00:47:59,992 --> 00:48:01,789
Five years.

818
00:48:07,867 --> 00:48:10,199
You're supposed to be in fucking...

819
00:48:10,369 --> 00:48:12,633
One Two, phone for you.

820
00:48:17,543 --> 00:48:20,444
Someone lose a bit of paperwork,
did they, One Two?

821
00:48:20,613 --> 00:48:22,945
- Very clever.
- Yeah, well, next time, you remember.

822
00:48:23,115 --> 00:48:26,278
That's exactly why you pay Lenny,
understood?

823
00:48:26,452 --> 00:48:28,613
<i>- All right.
- Good.</i>

824
00:48:33,225 --> 00:48:34,658
How did you get this number?

825
00:48:34,827 --> 00:48:36,692
Oh, I can get any number.

826
00:48:36,862 --> 00:48:38,386
I work with numbers, don't I?

827
00:48:39,031 --> 00:48:42,125
One point for initiative,
and two to tell me what's on your mind.

828
00:48:43,235 --> 00:48:46,227
My old man's having a party tonight,
and he needs some smarties.

829
00:48:46,405 --> 00:48:48,839
It's a liberty,
but I thought you might know someone.

830
00:48:49,008 --> 00:48:51,704
<i>- Sorry, not my thing.
- And I've got a bit of work for you.</i>

831
00:48:52,344 --> 00:48:55,575
<i>You can bring your friends.
Lots of interesting people there.</i>

832
00:48:55,748 --> 00:48:58,911
<i>- Rich and famous, great and the good.
- All right.</i>

833
00:48:59,652 --> 00:49:01,643
<i>Let me see what I can do.</i>

834
00:49:30,983 --> 00:49:32,575
Okay?

835
00:49:45,998 --> 00:49:49,365
Yeah, a nice drop of whiskey.
That, I must say.

836
00:49:49,535 --> 00:49:51,560
I suppose you're wondering
why you are here.

837
00:49:51,737 --> 00:49:55,298
Well, I assume you just wanted to check
that everything was kosher my end.

838
00:49:55,474 --> 00:49:58,341
I was surprised
when you didn't come through...

839
00:49:58,510 --> 00:49:59,772
...at the appropriate time.

840
00:49:59,945 --> 00:50:02,743
But then,
I reckon you must have your reasons.

841
00:50:02,915 --> 00:50:03,939
I understand that.

842
00:50:04,116 --> 00:50:06,983
And I wouldn't like things
to go wrong either...

843
00:50:07,152 --> 00:50:10,178
...which brings me conveniently
to my next point.

844
00:50:10,622 --> 00:50:13,147
Ever since the painting,
you know, my lucky painting...

845
00:50:13,325 --> 00:50:19,389
...hasn't been hanging on my wall,
things have not been so lucky.

846
00:50:19,565 --> 00:50:23,023
I know this is a rude request because
we have not concluded our business...

847
00:50:23,202 --> 00:50:26,797
...but I feel as though I need it.

848
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:28,536
Yeah.

849
00:50:34,513 --> 00:50:37,311
Fucking hell.
He's given you that bar tan again.

850
00:50:37,483 --> 00:50:40,577
- You wanna lay off that vodka.
- Shut up, Arch.

851
00:50:40,753 --> 00:50:43,278
- Everything all right?
- No, it fucking ain't all right.

852
00:50:43,455 --> 00:50:46,049
He wants his painting back.
His lucky painting.

853
00:50:46,225 --> 00:50:47,692
Painting?

854
00:50:48,327 --> 00:50:50,989
- That is a bit of a problem.
- You should've seen his eyes.

855
00:50:51,163 --> 00:50:54,291
I swear, they changed color.
They went fucking red.

856
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,235
They don't care
whose soil they're on, this lot.

857
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:01,232
They could buy up half of London
without breaking a sweat.

858
00:51:01,407 --> 00:51:02,431
You're small-time.

859
00:51:02,608 --> 00:51:04,508
They click their fingers,
we'd be ether.

860
00:51:04,676 --> 00:51:08,476
You speak to me like that again,
I'll cut your fucking tongue out.

861
00:51:08,647 --> 00:51:11,309
I run this town. You got that?

862
00:51:11,483 --> 00:51:13,007
Me.

863
00:51:14,153 --> 00:51:17,350
Anyone who thinks he's rude enough,
let him raise a finger...

864
00:51:17,523 --> 00:51:21,357
...because I'll tear his fucking arm off.

865
00:51:22,394 --> 00:51:25,386
Do you understand that, Archy, do you?

866
00:51:25,764 --> 00:51:27,732
Yeah, yeah, I understand that.

867
00:51:30,202 --> 00:51:32,363
How about that?

868
00:51:32,538 --> 00:51:35,336
Johnny Quid's daddy. Mm.

869
00:51:36,308 --> 00:51:38,776
How did that go under the radar?

870
00:51:39,445 --> 00:51:40,605
Why doesn't anybody know?

871
00:51:40,779 --> 00:51:43,373
Would you want anyone to know
if that was your dad?

872
00:51:43,549 --> 00:51:46,382
Would we have signed him
if we would've known?

873
00:51:46,752 --> 00:51:48,413
I know what.

874
00:51:48,587 --> 00:51:52,353
We better give
that man something, anything.

875
00:51:52,524 --> 00:51:56,255
A bed that's been slept in,
a bone for his dog, some token of effort.

876
00:51:56,428 --> 00:52:00,330
If you want to find Johnny,
you have to see Cookie.

877
00:52:06,505 --> 00:52:07,995
Who are you?

878
00:52:08,974 --> 00:52:10,965
My name's Cookie.

879
00:52:11,477 --> 00:52:12,603
You must be with Stella.

880
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:14,342
No, we're the SWAT team.

881
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,713
Well, you better get swatting.

882
00:52:21,453 --> 00:52:22,943
This is gonna be a scream.

883
00:52:23,122 --> 00:52:24,453
Tallyho.

884
00:52:24,623 --> 00:52:26,887
- Fred, get them in.
- Come here.

885
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:30,153
- Why me?
- Because you look like one of them.

886
00:52:30,596 --> 00:52:33,394
Take that chewing gum off your feet
before you start dancing.

887
00:52:33,565 --> 00:52:34,964
Follow me, boys.

888
00:52:41,006 --> 00:52:43,497
So who the man?

889
00:52:43,675 --> 00:52:46,371
- Cookie, I think that's your cue.
- Who's got the gear?

890
00:52:46,545 --> 00:52:48,274
Think I'll have a little dance first.

891
00:52:48,447 --> 00:52:51,541
- Fred, you fancy it?
- Yeah, go on.

892
00:52:53,886 --> 00:52:55,911
Look at the girls.

893
00:52:59,391 --> 00:53:02,258
Excuse me, darling.
What the fuck are you doing here, Bob?

894
00:53:02,694 --> 00:53:05,561
Well, all the boys were coming,
and I didn't have any plans.

895
00:53:05,731 --> 00:53:07,460
I thought I was gonna be locked up.

896
00:53:07,633 --> 00:53:09,430
So I thought I'd come and celebrate.

897
00:53:09,835 --> 00:53:12,963
- Do you fucking mind?
- Of course I fucking mind, Bob.

898
00:53:13,372 --> 00:53:15,772
What happened last night, okay,
between you and I...

899
00:53:15,941 --> 00:53:17,966
...that's our little secret, all right?

900
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:21,504
It happened because you're
supposed to be going to prison today.

901
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,979
If you tell anybody
about what happened last night, anybody...

902
00:53:27,152 --> 00:53:29,950
- Oh, good evening, gentlemen.
- Hi.

903
00:53:30,122 --> 00:53:31,919
- Fuck...
- Help yourselves to drinks.

904
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:33,523
Okay, definitely, yeah.

905
00:53:36,695 --> 00:53:37,992
- Go that way.
- She's nice.

906
00:53:38,163 --> 00:53:39,596
Go that way.

907
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,036
Then I'm like, "Bertie, take a Quaalude,"
you know what I mean?

908
00:53:46,972 --> 00:53:48,439
All right.

909
00:53:50,542 --> 00:53:52,100
Drink?

910
00:53:52,277 --> 00:53:54,472
- Dance?
- You're a dancer?

911
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,109
Am I a dancer?

912
00:53:57,282 --> 00:53:59,512
Shall we set the record straight?

913
00:53:59,685 --> 00:54:03,781
See, my dad was a dancer,
and his dad before him.

914
00:54:03,956 --> 00:54:08,256
So finally, it percolated
through the old DNA.

915
00:54:11,763 --> 00:54:13,492
You're not joining me?

916
00:54:14,499 --> 00:54:15,898
Sure.

917
00:54:16,068 --> 00:54:17,968
I like to dance.

918
00:54:34,953 --> 00:54:36,045
No.

919
00:54:36,221 --> 00:54:38,917
I'm Bertie. It's my party.

920
00:54:39,091 --> 00:54:40,718
So you're part of the Wild Bunch?

921
00:54:40,892 --> 00:54:43,258
Stella says you're dangerous.

922
00:54:45,163 --> 00:54:46,187
I am dangerous.

923
00:55:03,515 --> 00:55:06,575
Is your friend part of the Wild Bunch?

924
00:55:06,752 --> 00:55:07,776
No.

925
00:55:08,453 --> 00:55:09,715
He is the Wild Bunch.

926
00:55:24,102 --> 00:55:26,400
- I know all about your type.
- Oh, yeah?

927
00:55:26,571 --> 00:55:29,039
- How's that, then?
- I'm a criminal lawyer.

928
00:55:29,207 --> 00:55:32,699
And I know a secret
about your part of town.

929
00:55:32,878 --> 00:55:34,573
What's that, then, Bertie?

930
00:55:34,746 --> 00:55:37,442
You have an informer
in your neck of the woods.

931
00:55:38,817 --> 00:55:40,546
What's his name?

932
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:42,949
You have to pay for secrets.

933
00:55:43,121 --> 00:55:45,988
Now, now, that's not very nice, is it?

934
00:55:47,492 --> 00:55:48,959
What's your price?

935
00:55:49,127 --> 00:55:53,826
And remember, I am dangerous.

936
00:55:53,999 --> 00:55:57,059
I want to meet the Wild Bunch.

937
00:56:01,273 --> 00:56:03,605
See that man sitting on the sofa?

938
00:56:03,775 --> 00:56:05,834
- Oh, the queen who's screwing me out.
- Yeah.

939
00:56:06,011 --> 00:56:08,138
- It's a bit hard to miss him.
- Do me a favor.

940
00:56:08,313 --> 00:56:11,407
- Go and chat him up, will you?
- Fuck off, who do you think I am?

941
00:56:11,583 --> 00:56:14,916
No, no, he's a bigtime lawyer
who reckons he knows about an informer...

942
00:56:15,087 --> 00:56:16,315
...in our part of town.

943
00:56:16,488 --> 00:56:18,149
Now, you were facing a five-stretch.

944
00:56:18,323 --> 00:56:20,723
And I figured
you might be interested, ain't it?

945
00:56:22,461 --> 00:56:24,122
Mm-hm.

946
00:56:28,433 --> 00:56:29,457
- Hey.
- How you doing?

947
00:56:29,634 --> 00:56:30,658
All right.

948
00:56:30,836 --> 00:56:33,168
- So we got another job on again.
- Yeah?

949
00:56:33,338 --> 00:56:34,464
Same one as before.

950
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:37,972
Cor, it's all going down in here.
It's the den of iniquity, I tell you.

951
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:39,804
I hear you have a secret.

952
00:56:39,978 --> 00:56:42,173
And by the looks of you,
you have more than one.

953
00:56:42,347 --> 00:56:44,315
I don't want to talk about work.

954
00:56:44,483 --> 00:56:49,352
If you tell me who this informer is,
then we can talk about anything you want.

955
00:56:49,955 --> 00:56:52,389
I gotta get myself a breath of fresh air.
Catch you...

956
00:56:52,557 --> 00:56:54,991
Oi, One Two, I owe you one.

957
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,119
This lot are doing more bugle
than a brass section.

958
00:56:59,498 --> 00:57:02,126
- I'm happy for you, Cookie.
- Yeah.

959
00:57:07,973 --> 00:57:11,841
If he's an informer,
you'll have his depositions, poems.

960
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:16,174
My, my, not just a pretty face.

961
00:57:16,915 --> 00:57:18,906
How'd you know
about those sort of things?

962
00:57:19,418 --> 00:57:20,715
Give me your mobile.

963
00:57:21,253 --> 00:57:22,481
- What?
- You heard me.

964
00:57:22,654 --> 00:57:24,178
Do as you're told.

965
00:57:27,959 --> 00:57:29,358
Ooh.

966
00:57:30,362 --> 00:57:31,886
That's nice.

967
00:57:33,765 --> 00:57:39,294
Here, we'll go for a drink next week,
and I'll tell you all about it.

968
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:44,472
All I need is some paperwork.

969
00:57:49,181 --> 00:57:51,240
Wait up, sing-along.

970
00:57:53,118 --> 00:57:54,847
Where's the rush?

971
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,180
All right.

972
00:57:56,555 --> 00:57:58,785
- What's wrong?
- Get that Archy on the phone.

973
00:57:58,957 --> 00:58:00,891
- I think we got a problem.
- What?

974
00:58:01,059 --> 00:58:03,323
How much is it gonna cost
if we shut down tonight?

975
00:58:03,495 --> 00:58:05,554
- Eleven thousand, three hundred...
- All right.

976
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:07,561
Go out there
and see what's going down.

977
00:58:18,009 --> 00:58:21,069
You, what do you think
you're doing?

978
00:58:21,246 --> 00:58:23,146
What do you think?
We're trying to get in.

979
00:58:23,315 --> 00:58:24,748
Go home, wasters.

980
00:58:24,916 --> 00:58:28,613
- It costs money to get in here.
- Yes, I'm aware of that, my good man.

981
00:58:28,787 --> 00:58:30,220
Mr. Archy.

982
00:58:30,922 --> 00:58:33,322
No, you can't shut us down.
We got an act on.

983
00:58:33,492 --> 00:58:36,586
<i>- And I'm interested?
- We got a band on-stage right now.</i>

984
00:58:36,761 --> 00:58:37,989
- Find him.
- I understand.

985
00:58:38,163 --> 00:58:41,462
Listen, but I have to keep the club open.
You hear that shit?

986
00:58:41,633 --> 00:58:42,861
Run along, junkies.

987
00:58:43,034 --> 00:58:45,628
Oi, lookie but no touchy.

988
00:58:46,304 --> 00:58:47,771
Get off of him, you slag.

989
00:58:47,939 --> 00:58:50,601
He is absolute class.

990
00:58:55,013 --> 00:58:58,176
I gotta keep the club open.
We got 400 people in here.

991
00:59:04,089 --> 00:59:06,057
Leave it, John. I'm happy.

992
00:59:06,224 --> 00:59:09,193
I'm all right down here, mate.
Let's call it a night, eh?

993
00:59:09,361 --> 00:59:12,489
- I'll fucking show him happy.
- Oh, no.

994
00:59:24,876 --> 00:59:26,173
Fancy some more talent, boy?

995
00:59:27,078 --> 00:59:29,740
I'd like to make a complaint.
What's your name?

996
00:59:29,915 --> 00:59:33,612
Jog on, boy,
before I grind your bones to make my bread.

997
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,527
Night, night.

998
01:00:26,972 --> 01:00:28,496
- Fucking mutt.
- Look at this, man.

999
01:00:28,673 --> 01:00:31,540
- It's a damn revolution going on outside.
- No shit.

1000
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:35,339
If we wanna keep our license
and the lights on, we gotta go find Cookie.

1001
01:00:41,853 --> 01:00:44,845
We'll put rock salt in the shells,
stick them in the revolver.

1002
01:00:45,023 --> 01:00:48,356
If they get large, we'll bang a couple
into them, should slow them down.

1003
01:00:48,526 --> 01:00:50,187
And they won't know the difference.

1004
01:00:50,362 --> 01:00:53,263
And then Bob's our driver, and...

1005
01:00:53,431 --> 01:00:56,059
- I don't wanna use Bob.
- What?

1006
01:00:56,234 --> 01:00:58,202
- I don't want to use Bob.
- He's our driver.

1007
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:00,668
The Wild Bunch is not complete
without the driver.

1008
01:01:00,839 --> 01:01:02,204
No.

1009
01:01:02,807 --> 01:01:04,707
What's happened
between you and Bob, then?

1010
01:01:08,613 --> 01:01:13,448
Mumbles, there is something about Bob
that I don't think you know.

1011
01:01:13,618 --> 01:01:15,950
What's that, then? That he's a poof?

1012
01:01:16,988 --> 01:01:20,424
- How the fuck did you know that?
- Come on, everyone knows he's a flamer.

1013
01:01:20,592 --> 01:01:24,221
You're the only one that doesn't.
No. He likes the boys.

1014
01:01:24,396 --> 01:01:26,296
It's sausage and beans
all day long, mate.

1015
01:01:26,464 --> 01:01:28,295
What the fuck are you talking about?

1016
01:01:29,634 --> 01:01:32,933
- Did he make a pass at you?
- Yes, he fucking did.

1017
01:01:33,104 --> 01:01:34,696
So, what's the problem?

1018
01:01:34,873 --> 01:01:37,569
It was supposed to be his last night.
You took care of him.

1019
01:01:37,742 --> 01:01:40,836
That's what friends do for one another.
Well done.

1020
01:01:41,346 --> 01:01:43,109
And I won't tell the chaps.

1021
01:01:45,483 --> 01:01:48,179
What the fuck do you mean?
You won't tell the chaps what?

1022
01:01:49,354 --> 01:01:51,345
So, what did you do? Did you suck his...?

1023
01:01:51,523 --> 01:01:53,491
Hey, hey, that's enough, all right?

1024
01:01:54,659 --> 01:01:57,560
What the fuck is going on here?

1025
01:01:57,896 --> 01:01:59,261
What? Did you suck his...?

1026
01:01:59,431 --> 01:02:01,592
- You must have touched him.
- No.

1027
01:02:01,766 --> 01:02:03,290
Hold on.

1028
01:02:05,503 --> 01:02:07,835
I'm not gay, all right, Mumbles?

1029
01:02:10,442 --> 01:02:12,842
He just asked
if I wanted a dance, that's all.

1030
01:02:16,181 --> 01:02:17,443
Was it a slow dance?

1031
01:02:26,257 --> 01:02:28,122
What has he done to me?

1032
01:02:28,293 --> 01:02:31,626
Mr. One Two, I think there is something
you should know about our Bob.

1033
01:02:32,664 --> 01:02:35,428
Who do you think looked after your mom
before she died...

1034
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,160
...when you was doing a two-stretch?

1035
01:02:38,336 --> 01:02:40,736
Because it wasn't me,
and I'm your best fucking pal.

1036
01:02:40,905 --> 01:02:42,338
No, it was Bob.

1037
01:02:42,507 --> 01:02:47,069
Bob was around there six times a week
making sure she was looked after.

1038
01:02:47,245 --> 01:02:51,841
You tore your mom's heart out when you
went away. Bob did his best to put it back.

1039
01:02:55,086 --> 01:02:57,281
I tell you something, Mr. One Two.

1040
01:02:57,455 --> 01:03:01,619
If I could be half the human that Bob is
at the price of being a poof...

1041
01:03:01,793 --> 01:03:03,522
...I'd think about it.

1042
01:03:05,163 --> 01:03:08,360
Not for too long,
but I'd have to pause, you know?

1043
01:03:11,836 --> 01:03:14,737
And the kid looks up and goes,
"Well, what do you fucking think? "

1044
01:03:16,708 --> 01:03:19,734
That joke was a lot funnier
when I told it to you last week.

1045
01:03:20,111 --> 01:03:21,772
Can I have a word with you, Cookie?

1046
01:03:21,946 --> 01:03:23,379
Treacles, would you mind?

1047
01:03:23,548 --> 01:03:25,709
On your toes. Five minutes.

1048
01:03:31,122 --> 01:03:32,646
Hey.

1049
01:03:33,191 --> 01:03:35,785
We need to know where Johnny Quid is.

1050
01:03:37,996 --> 01:03:40,624
You should probably be the first
to know, but isn't he...?

1051
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:44,792
I know. Come on, you know
and I know that nothing killed Johnny.

1052
01:03:45,236 --> 01:03:48,603
Come on, Cookie, you've been fucking
his life up for the past five years.

1053
01:03:48,773 --> 01:03:51,241
Come on, show our boy a little love.

1054
01:03:54,245 --> 01:03:57,373
You ever bought a ticket
to the junkies' boneyard, Roman?

1055
01:03:58,049 --> 01:04:02,748
It's an unpleasant place
called curl up and die.

1056
01:04:03,388 --> 01:04:05,015
Might sound like a hair salon...

1057
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:08,159
...but it don't fucking look like one,
I can tell you.

1058
01:04:08,693 --> 01:04:15,064
It's a terrible sight,
and a horrible sound listening to a man...

1059
01:04:16,067 --> 01:04:19,730
...sucking his soul
through the hole in the pipe.

1060
01:04:20,405 --> 01:04:22,930
And even worse
when he tries to tear it back.

1061
01:04:23,341 --> 01:04:25,468
I've been there, and I've done that.

1062
01:04:25,643 --> 01:04:28,476
He has been here, and he has done that.

1063
01:04:28,646 --> 01:04:32,776
And then I nailed that demon
in a smoke-proof coffin.

1064
01:04:32,951 --> 01:04:35,044
And I did it all with Johnny.

1065
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,283
I love that man.

1066
01:04:37,455 --> 01:04:39,582
He's what you call class.

1067
01:04:39,757 --> 01:04:42,089
If you had any brains, Roman,
you'd love him too.

1068
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:47,129
You know, his music sales have gone up
a thousand percent in two weeks.

1069
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:52,463
You see, Johnny, the crackhead knows...

1070
01:04:52,637 --> 01:04:56,630
...that a rocker
is worth more dead than alive.

1071
01:04:57,242 --> 01:04:59,210
Silly world, isn't it?

1072
01:05:01,145 --> 01:05:04,740
Mr. Quid does not get his gear from me.

1073
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:08,113
He has to travel far and wide.

1074
01:05:08,286 --> 01:05:09,583
But do leave me your number.

1075
01:05:09,754 --> 01:05:14,054
And if the dead feels like calling...

1076
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:16,686
...you'll be the first to know.

1077
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:14,942
I'll have the painting for you
in a couple of days.

1078
01:07:15,112 --> 01:07:18,639
I had it locked up with some other goods.
You know, I was keeping it safe.

1079
01:07:18,816 --> 01:07:21,785
And then Archy goes and loses the key.

1080
01:07:21,953 --> 01:07:23,545
Don't you, Arch?

1081
01:07:25,223 --> 01:07:28,454
So I'm not trying to be funny,
but I've got this payment tonight...

1082
01:07:28,626 --> 01:07:32,790
...and if there's any chance
of having the money...

1083
01:07:38,936 --> 01:07:41,063
Where the fuck has he gone, then?

1084
01:07:41,806 --> 01:07:45,333
I don't know. But I don't think
he was too impressed with that story, Len.

1085
01:07:46,978 --> 01:07:49,674
Something wrong with these immigrants.
I don't trust them.

1086
01:07:49,847 --> 01:07:51,781
I think we're being set up.

1087
01:07:51,949 --> 01:07:54,816
I don't know how,
but something is wrong.

1088
01:07:55,152 --> 01:07:56,813
I can smell it with my sniffer.

1089
01:08:00,358 --> 01:08:02,485
He doesn't have the balls or the brains.

1090
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:05,527
He's a crook.
Small-time, backhanding crook.

1091
01:08:12,069 --> 01:08:14,128
I think he's trying
to make fool out of you.

1092
01:08:14,305 --> 01:08:16,170
Adjourn the meeting.

1093
01:08:32,657 --> 01:08:35,057
Oh, my God, you're a mess.

1094
01:08:35,993 --> 01:08:37,620
There you go.

1095
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:42,631
Are you all right?

1096
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,735
That is a rhetorical question, I hope.

1097
01:08:48,139 --> 01:08:53,406
I'll have a water, please,
with a big, long straw.

1098
01:08:53,844 --> 01:08:55,368
Thank you.

1099
01:09:01,686 --> 01:09:04,951
So you don't wanna know
what happened?

1100
01:09:25,776 --> 01:09:27,767
Put it, put it. Cut it.

1101
01:09:30,481 --> 01:09:32,244
I know what happened.

1102
01:09:41,392 --> 01:09:43,883
- Don't go in there.
- Mumbles.

1103
01:09:45,229 --> 01:09:46,253
Mace him.

1104
01:09:46,764 --> 01:09:48,095
Hollandaise?

1105
01:09:48,265 --> 01:09:49,960
I see you ordered already.

1106
01:09:50,134 --> 01:09:51,601
You were late.

1107
01:09:52,169 --> 01:09:53,568
The bastard's gonna hit me.

1108
01:09:54,472 --> 01:09:56,337
- Mace him, Mumbles.
- What?

1109
01:09:56,507 --> 01:09:57,940
- Not me, you idiot.
- What?

1110
01:09:58,109 --> 01:09:59,633
- I can't move my...
- What?

1111
01:10:11,021 --> 01:10:13,046
This way, this way, this way.

1112
01:10:18,696 --> 01:10:20,687
Shouldn't you have taken precautions?

1113
01:10:27,138 --> 01:10:28,799
Precautions?

1114
01:10:36,447 --> 01:10:38,381
- Did you see that?
- What happened?

1115
01:10:38,549 --> 01:10:39,948
God.

1116
01:10:40,851 --> 01:10:42,944
Well, it's your job, isn't it?

1117
01:10:56,934 --> 01:10:59,266
What are these guys made of?

1118
01:11:01,205 --> 01:11:02,502
I didn't realize.

1119
01:11:02,673 --> 01:11:04,538
Realize?

1120
01:11:04,708 --> 01:11:06,471
You didn't realize that they had guns?

1121
01:11:08,179 --> 01:11:10,841
Big, long, dangerous machine guns.

1122
01:11:11,715 --> 01:11:13,876
With war criminals
attached to the trigger.

1123
01:11:16,954 --> 01:11:17,978
Please, stay down.

1124
01:11:20,991 --> 01:11:22,652
Just fuck off.

1125
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,105
Get out of the fucking way now.

1126
01:11:51,455 --> 01:11:52,854
You know what, darling?

1127
01:11:53,023 --> 01:11:57,392
I'm just gonna leave this laundry bag here
under the table for you, okay?

1128
01:12:01,632 --> 01:12:03,327
Fucking hell.

1129
01:12:07,438 --> 01:12:09,099
Shit.

1130
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,302
Hold up.

1131
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:14,902
Oh, my...

1132
01:12:21,385 --> 01:12:22,750
Oh, fucking hell.

1133
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:30,959
Abandon ship.

1134
01:12:31,729 --> 01:12:32,821
Run for your lives.

1135
01:13:32,122 --> 01:13:34,613
Come on. Come on.

1136
01:13:37,161 --> 01:13:39,629
Come back with my bike,
you dirty bastard.

1137
01:15:28,272 --> 01:15:29,830
Goodbye, sweetheart.

1138
01:15:30,007 --> 01:15:31,804
You're way too dangerous for me.

1139
01:15:37,047 --> 01:15:39,675
- Did I overdo it with the limp?
- No, the limp was good.

1140
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:41,715
She's a wild one.

1141
01:15:41,885 --> 01:15:44,149
She likes you, boy-o.

1142
01:15:44,521 --> 01:15:46,250
Rather her than you, Bob.

1143
01:16:00,604 --> 01:16:02,504
I don't care if he is fucking busy, Archy.

1144
01:16:02,673 --> 01:16:05,107
If we call, he answers. That's the deal.

1145
01:16:05,275 --> 01:16:06,435
Oh, there he is.

1146
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:08,942
Oi, Councillor.

1147
01:16:09,379 --> 01:16:10,903
Councillor.

1148
01:16:11,081 --> 01:16:12,139
I'll see you at lunch.

1149
01:16:12,316 --> 01:16:14,682
Something wrong with your telephone?

1150
01:16:14,852 --> 01:16:16,877
Oh, I'm sorry. Shouldn't I be here?

1151
01:16:17,054 --> 01:16:20,717
I go wherever I fucking like
because this is my town, not yours...

1152
01:16:20,891 --> 01:16:25,658
...no matter what you and your pen-pushing
immigrant boy scouts might think.

1153
01:16:26,597 --> 01:16:28,588
So, what's going on?

1154
01:16:28,766 --> 01:16:30,427
Step in here.

1155
01:16:32,536 --> 01:16:33,833
I can't do it.

1156
01:16:34,004 --> 01:16:37,496
You've left it too long. You want
something the city has a ruling against.

1157
01:16:37,674 --> 01:16:39,505
They wouldn't give permission to build.

1158
01:16:39,676 --> 01:16:41,371
Don't give me that shit.

1159
01:16:41,545 --> 01:16:43,672
I look out my window,
I see 20 buildings...

1160
01:16:43,847 --> 01:16:45,576
...this city said they'd never build.

1161
01:16:45,749 --> 01:16:49,344
How did that happen? The termites
got together for a building party, did they?

1162
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:52,780
No, sunshine.
It was backhanders putting them up.

1163
01:16:52,956 --> 01:16:54,218
Backhanders like mine.

1164
01:16:54,925 --> 01:16:58,019
Lenny's good for the money,
Councillor. He always has been.

1165
01:16:58,195 --> 01:17:00,823
- So don't go getting cold feet.
- I can't do it this time.

1166
01:17:00,998 --> 01:17:03,057
It's not fucking Zaire, Lenny.

1167
01:17:03,233 --> 01:17:04,495
Get off my bollocks, Lenny.

1168
01:17:04,668 --> 01:17:08,729
Don't you ever swear at me,
you yellow puddle of immigrant piss...

1169
01:17:08,906 --> 01:17:10,999
...or I'll drown you in it.

1170
01:17:11,575 --> 01:17:13,406
You feel that, do you, Councillor?

1171
01:17:13,877 --> 01:17:16,607
You don't think there's a paper trail
for all those gifts?

1172
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:21,342
The cars, the holidays,
the tennis courts, the swimming pools.

1173
01:17:21,518 --> 01:17:23,543
I own these bollocks.

1174
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:28,384
And right now, they're more fragile
than a pair of quail's eggs.

1175
01:17:28,559 --> 01:17:30,026
Now, get it done.

1176
01:17:45,008 --> 01:17:46,703
Pedro?

1177
01:17:48,345 --> 01:17:50,108
Come back here.

1178
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:56,151
Where do you think you're going
with that painting?

1179
01:17:56,887 --> 01:18:00,550
You never said it was your dad's,
or whatever you wanna call him.

1180
01:18:00,724 --> 01:18:02,191
You've gotta give it back, John.

1181
01:18:02,359 --> 01:18:05,385
People are looking for it, bad people.

1182
01:18:05,996 --> 01:18:08,829
The streets are alive
with the sound of pain.

1183
01:18:08,999 --> 01:18:12,992
You may have a point, Pete,
but I can't give it up.

1184
01:18:13,170 --> 01:18:15,104
- You know why?
- No. Why?

1185
01:18:16,206 --> 01:18:17,798
Meet me in the pub in two minutes.

1186
01:18:18,642 --> 01:18:20,633
I'll have that painting
in a couple of days.

1187
01:18:20,811 --> 01:18:22,938
- You can trust me on that.
-Good.

1188
01:18:23,313 --> 01:18:25,873
That's nice. I love a clear fairway.

1189
01:18:26,049 --> 01:18:27,778
That's a bit of me. That is...

1190
01:18:27,951 --> 01:18:30,146
So you like it out here, Lenny, don't you?

1191
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,584
Oh, yeah.
You can't beat the great outdoors, Uri.

1192
01:18:32,756 --> 01:18:34,724
But I don't understand it.

1193
01:18:34,892 --> 01:18:36,189
There's no one here.

1194
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:39,454
That's because I have had the course
cleared for us.

1195
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:41,825
We are not going to be disturbed.

1196
01:18:45,469 --> 01:18:49,462
Victor, please, come to join us.

1197
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,714
You see that pack of Virginia killing sticks
on the end of the piano?

1198
01:19:02,786 --> 01:19:03,946
Yes.

1199
01:19:04,121 --> 01:19:08,114
All you need to know about life
is retained within those four walls.

1200
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,790
<i>What are we going to do, Lenny?</i>

1201
01:19:13,463 --> 01:19:16,864
Every time I am about
to make my payment...

1202
01:19:19,002 --> 01:19:20,970
...something dishonest happens.

1203
01:19:22,906 --> 01:19:24,874
You wouldn't know anything, would you?

1204
01:19:25,042 --> 01:19:27,272
You will notice that
one of your personalities

1205
01:19:27,273 --> 01:19:29,502
is seduced by the illusions of grandeur.

1206
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:33,116
A gold packet of king size
with a regal insignia.

1207
01:19:33,283 --> 01:19:36,446
An attractive implication
toward glamour and wealth.

1208
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:41,114
A subtle suggestion that cigarettes
are indeed your royal and loyal friends.

1209
01:19:41,291 --> 01:19:43,225
<i>And that, Pete, is a lie.</i>

1210
01:19:43,393 --> 01:19:45,987
Excuse me?
Are you trying to say something?

1211
01:19:46,463 --> 01:19:48,260
I'm not trying.

1212
01:19:48,932 --> 01:19:50,991
I am saying something.

1213
01:19:54,771 --> 01:19:59,037
Your other personality is trying to draw your
attention to the flip side of the discussion.

1214
01:19:59,209 --> 01:20:02,007
Written in boring, bold,
black and white, is the statement...

1215
01:20:02,179 --> 01:20:07,139
...that these neat little soldiers of death,
are, in fact, trying to kill you.

1216
01:20:07,317 --> 01:20:10,184
And that, Pete, is the truth.

1217
01:20:11,154 --> 01:20:14,783
I think you forget who you're talking to,
you insolent bastard.

1218
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:19,761
I think you forget where you are,
you fucking immigrant.

1219
01:20:21,431 --> 01:20:27,233
Oh, beauty is a beguiling call to death and
I'm addicted to the sweet pitch of its siren.

1220
01:20:27,404 --> 01:20:30,567
This is my land. It's my fucking show.

1221
01:20:30,741 --> 01:20:32,231
I run this town.

1222
01:20:32,409 --> 01:20:33,933
Ah! Fuck!

1223
01:20:34,111 --> 01:20:36,443
Ah! God! Ah!

1224
01:20:47,024 --> 01:20:50,289
<i>That that starts sweet ends bitter.</i>

1225
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:53,054
And that which starts bitter ends sweet.

1226
01:20:54,097 --> 01:20:56,065
I have to go now, Lenny.

1227
01:20:56,233 --> 01:20:59,669
I am having lunch
with the Councillor, your councilor.

1228
01:21:00,137 --> 01:21:02,469
<i>This, as you know, is the ninth hole.</i>

1229
01:21:03,006 --> 01:21:05,998
And it's a long crawl back to your car.

1230
01:21:06,777 --> 01:21:12,738
You should make it by sunrise,
just in time to bring me my lucky picture.

1231
01:21:13,183 --> 01:21:15,310
<i>I want it back.</i>

1232
01:21:15,485 --> 01:21:17,316
Do you hear me?

1233
01:21:18,288 --> 01:21:21,849
- Yes, yes, oh, God.
-Times change.

1234
01:21:22,726 --> 01:21:24,318
Goodbye, Lenny.

1235
01:21:26,997 --> 01:21:31,434
That is why you and I love the drugs...

1236
01:21:31,601 --> 01:21:36,265
...and that is also why
I cannot give that painting back.

1237
01:21:43,814 --> 01:21:47,113
Now, please, pass me a light.

1238
01:21:49,086 --> 01:21:52,954
Oh, you are something special,
Mr. Johnny Quid.

1239
01:21:57,561 --> 01:21:59,552
Fucking junkies. You're fucking useless.

1240
01:21:59,729 --> 01:22:01,287
I don't want your sort in here.

1241
01:22:01,465 --> 01:22:02,898
Get up out of here. Fuck off.

1242
01:22:03,066 --> 01:22:05,034
- Go piss off out the door.
- Get off.

1243
01:22:05,202 --> 01:22:07,227
- Go on, fuck off.
- I'll buy this place.

1244
01:22:07,838 --> 01:22:09,533
Fuck off, you junkie.

1245
01:22:09,706 --> 01:22:12,504
- You won't be able to catch me, fat boy.
- Stay out and fuck off.

1246
01:22:13,009 --> 01:22:13,998
Ooh.

1247
01:22:16,079 --> 01:22:17,671
Is that you, Bertie?

1248
01:22:17,848 --> 01:22:19,816
<i>What's happening about that drink?</i>

1249
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:22,315
What's happening about that paperwork?

1250
01:22:22,953 --> 01:22:26,514
Well, I'm busy tonight,
but Monday looks good.

1251
01:22:26,857 --> 01:22:29,325
I'll leave the papers
at my reception under your name.

1252
01:22:29,493 --> 01:22:30,858
<i>Text you the address.</i>

1253
01:22:31,027 --> 01:22:35,964
Well, I'll pop around in a jiffy,
and I'll see you on Monday.

1254
01:22:41,071 --> 01:22:43,335
You are scary good at that.

1255
01:22:43,507 --> 01:22:46,965
- Do you miss it?
- Shut up, Bob, or I'll slap you.

1256
01:22:47,144 --> 01:22:50,341
All right, let's go pick up the paperwork
from your boyfriend.

1257
01:22:50,514 --> 01:22:52,846
And drop me off on the way, huh?

1258
01:22:53,583 --> 01:22:56,245
I'm going back to bed.

1259
01:22:56,686 --> 01:22:58,313
Can I come?

1260
01:23:04,027 --> 01:23:06,757
- Moron, what do you think you're doing?
- What, John?

1261
01:23:06,930 --> 01:23:09,125
Letting creatures in my yard
without my consent.

1262
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:14,928
John, they're good stuff.
Scotch and Cockney.

1263
01:23:15,338 --> 01:23:17,568
Like the drink and the sparrow.

1264
01:23:17,741 --> 01:23:21,233
I am Malcolm, and this is my friend
and colleague Paul.

1265
01:23:22,279 --> 01:23:25,271
You know, like the Christian saint.

1266
01:23:25,916 --> 01:23:30,546
Paul doesn't say much.
He's too busy thinking deep thoughts.

1267
01:23:31,888 --> 01:23:34,789
Come on, John. We know you.

1268
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:36,721
We're big fans.

1269
01:23:36,893 --> 01:23:41,762
You're what they call a real RocknRolla.

1270
01:23:42,933 --> 01:23:47,165
Out, on your way.
Bon voyage and fuck off.

1271
01:23:51,208 --> 01:23:54,473
What is this, a sit-down?
A fucking demo?

1272
01:23:55,545 --> 01:23:58,480
This is a demonstration,
a demonstration of peace.

1273
01:23:59,015 --> 01:24:01,813
Where the fuck did you find
these two junkies?

1274
01:24:01,985 --> 01:24:05,819
Conference, kazi, now.

1275
01:24:12,696 --> 01:24:15,256
That's the last time
I'm having you take the piss, Pete.

1276
01:24:15,432 --> 01:24:18,094
Next time, you're on your own.

1277
01:24:18,268 --> 01:24:19,633
I'm sorry.

1278
01:24:19,803 --> 01:24:22,795
I just thought that you might've liked
a bit of company.

1279
01:24:22,973 --> 01:24:25,271
I'm dead, Pete. What does that tell you?

1280
01:24:25,442 --> 01:24:29,139
It tells you that dead people
don't like company.

1281
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:32,941
- Now, jog them on.
- All right, I'll tell them to leave.

1282
01:24:33,116 --> 01:24:36,950
Yes, you fucking well will.
Smelly junkies.

1283
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,951
Meeting adjourned.

1284
01:24:42,659 --> 01:24:44,684
You've scared them off, sing-along.

1285
01:24:44,861 --> 01:24:47,659
But with a welcome like that,
it's not all that shocking.

1286
01:24:47,831 --> 01:24:50,299
Lucky you're not following them, Pete.

1287
01:24:53,903 --> 01:24:55,530
Pete, where's the painting?

1288
01:24:59,309 --> 01:25:00,640
Good shot. Good shot.

1289
01:25:01,645 --> 01:25:02,907
It's the werewolf brothers.

1290
01:25:03,079 --> 01:25:05,343
What you got for us today, boys?
Anything good?

1291
01:25:06,016 --> 01:25:08,746
Paul, please exhibit to the audience
the fine artifact.

1292
01:25:15,191 --> 01:25:17,955
Gentlemen, we are entering the realm...

1293
01:25:18,128 --> 01:25:22,030
...of the ancient art form
of paint on canvas.

1294
01:25:22,198 --> 01:25:23,324
I'll have it. How much?

1295
01:25:24,634 --> 01:25:27,569
One moment, sir. There's a pitch
which comes with this painting.

1296
01:25:27,737 --> 01:25:30,331
I don't want the pitch. I said I'll have it.

1297
01:25:31,441 --> 01:25:34,171
It's a very rare
and expensive painting, sir.

1298
01:25:34,344 --> 01:25:36,039
Is it?

1299
01:25:37,147 --> 01:25:39,138
There you go, boys.
Have a week in the snow.

1300
01:25:40,050 --> 01:25:43,076
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
It's been a pleasure.

1301
01:25:43,253 --> 01:25:45,278
Come on, me man. Hey.

1302
01:25:49,793 --> 01:25:52,227
Tank, what is it? I'm in a bit of a rush.

1303
01:25:52,395 --> 01:25:54,158
<i>- You owe me, Arch.
- Oh, yeah?</i>

1304
01:25:54,331 --> 01:25:58,062
First, I found your painting. Now I found
out who's been taking Lenny's money.

1305
01:25:58,234 --> 01:25:59,258
<i>Mr. Darcy.</i>

1306
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:02,538
Well, don't fuck about. Who is it?

1307
01:26:18,021 --> 01:26:21,582
"Let myself in. Thought your lady
might like the painting.

1308
01:26:23,259 --> 01:26:24,556
Love, Cookie."

1309
01:26:28,865 --> 01:26:31,231
- Hello?
- It's me.

1310
01:26:31,735 --> 01:26:34,602
- Who's me?
- Me.

1311
01:26:35,105 --> 01:26:36,333
<i>Ah.</i>

1312
01:26:36,806 --> 01:26:38,433
Well, what do you want?

1313
01:26:39,175 --> 01:26:40,574
You.

1314
01:26:41,411 --> 01:26:42,639
<i>Oh.</i>

1315
01:26:43,513 --> 01:26:45,378
Well, you better come in, then.

1316
01:27:10,173 --> 01:27:12,368
<i>- Yup?
- We found out about our informer.</i>

1317
01:27:12,542 --> 01:27:14,373
<i>I've got it in my hand right now.</i>

1318
01:27:14,544 --> 01:27:18,708
The informer, the one who's responsible
for all the time we've been seeing.

1319
01:27:18,882 --> 01:27:22,682
- All of them, including mine.
- Well, who is it, then?

1320
01:27:25,622 --> 01:27:27,817
Who the fuck is Sidney Shaw?

1321
01:27:28,558 --> 01:27:31,527
No, Sidney Shaw
is a pseudonym, you idiot.

1322
01:27:31,995 --> 01:27:33,860
<i>They never use their real name.</i>

1323
01:27:34,030 --> 01:27:37,124
Look, get around here
and let me have a look, okay?

1324
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:38,665
<i>All right.</i>

1325
01:27:42,071 --> 01:27:44,471
Where did he learn
a word like pseudonym?

1326
01:27:47,076 --> 01:27:48,976
Look at you, huh? Good as new.

1327
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:52,911
I have to go now.

1328
01:27:53,616 --> 01:27:57,848
So you fancy sharing some dancing lessons
with me later on in the week?

1329
01:27:58,021 --> 01:28:00,114
A bit of the old salsa?

1330
01:28:02,091 --> 01:28:04,184
I'll take you up on that.

1331
01:28:05,094 --> 01:28:07,790
- Oh, I have something for you.
- Uh-huh.

1332
01:28:07,964 --> 01:28:11,627
Thought you might like it because
I know how much you like paintings and all.

1333
01:28:17,774 --> 01:28:19,469
So you like it?

1334
01:28:20,944 --> 01:28:24,175
You've got very good taste,
Mr. One Two.

1335
01:28:27,083 --> 01:28:28,448
Oh...

1336
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:33,617
- What's happened, Len?
- Well, they broke my leg in four places.

1337
01:28:33,790 --> 01:28:35,621
Didn't you hear?

1338
01:28:36,493 --> 01:28:39,394
That bastard's made me limp
for the rest of my days.

1339
01:28:40,029 --> 01:28:41,963
What do you want me to do?

1340
01:28:43,233 --> 01:28:47,033
Well, I need that painting, Arch.

1341
01:28:47,203 --> 01:28:50,934
- I need it real bad.
- I'll get that for you, don't you worry.

1342
01:28:51,107 --> 01:28:53,871
- I think I can do better than that.
- What?

1343
01:28:54,043 --> 01:28:57,376
Someone has been at the Russian's money.
Couple of silly gunslingers.

1344
01:28:57,547 --> 01:29:00,846
- Well, who?
- You know them.

1345
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:04,449
- You don't like them either.
- I'm not playing fucking games here, Arch.

1346
01:29:04,621 --> 01:29:06,088
Who is it?

1347
01:29:07,824 --> 01:29:09,382
Mumbles, Bob and One Two.

1348
01:30:15,325 --> 01:30:20,456
- So why did you call, Johnny?
- Sorry, Johnny's not here.

1349
01:30:20,630 --> 01:30:22,621
But the pipe is.

1350
01:30:22,799 --> 01:30:26,200
And the pipe says
Johnny heard you were in trouble, boys.

1351
01:30:26,369 --> 01:30:29,600
Whoever we're talking to, will you
please relay the message to Johnny?

1352
01:30:29,772 --> 01:30:34,903
Tell him that his dad, his jack-in-the-box-
surprise, gangster daddy, paid us a visit.

1353
01:30:35,345 --> 01:30:36,835
Shut down a few of our venues.

1354
01:30:37,013 --> 01:30:41,643
Intends to shut down a few more
unless Mr. Quid puts in an appearance.

1355
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:47,886
Why are you talking to the pipe, Roman?
You're madder than I am.

1356
01:30:48,891 --> 01:30:51,519
Come back, Johnny. Come back home.

1357
01:30:53,529 --> 01:30:56,726
Now, Johnny will come quietly...

1358
01:30:56,899 --> 01:31:01,563
...but you may have a couple of problems
with the pipe.

1359
01:31:02,538 --> 01:31:04,062
Buy us both a cup of tea.

1360
01:31:04,674 --> 01:31:07,700
No need for any noise,
we'll let Pete sleep on.

1361
01:32:29,992 --> 01:32:31,721
Is this a bad time, One Two?

1362
01:32:37,233 --> 01:32:39,633
I mean, we can always
come back a bit later.

1363
01:32:45,675 --> 01:32:49,076
You wanna take the stairs
or the elevator, Mr. Cole?

1364
01:32:49,245 --> 01:32:51,509
Bandy, come here.

1365
01:32:57,153 --> 01:33:00,054
- You been drinking?
- No, Mr. Cole.

1366
01:33:01,891 --> 01:33:05,827
Think before you drink,
before you drive me mad.

1367
01:33:09,532 --> 01:33:11,397
<i>- Hello, Len, it's me.
- Archy.</i>

1368
01:33:11,567 --> 01:33:14,161
I've got the boys
wrapping up One Two in a carpet now.

1369
01:33:14,337 --> 01:33:15,429
<i>Get over here.</i>

1370
01:33:15,605 --> 01:33:17,664
<i>- Yeah, I'll be around in a little bit.
- Good.</i>

1371
01:33:21,577 --> 01:33:23,135
Hold on.

1372
01:33:27,650 --> 01:33:30,483
- Who's there?
- One Two, it's us.

1373
01:33:30,653 --> 01:33:32,280
Come up.

1374
01:33:34,257 --> 01:33:36,748
And it looks like
I'll be bringing the others and all.

1375
01:33:36,926 --> 01:33:39,451
Not too bright this lot, are they?
Hold on.

1376
01:33:39,629 --> 01:33:43,622
Look, I gotta go, got another call.
Fucking hell, it's all go on this job.

1377
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:47,099
- Hello?
- Archy, we got your boy.

1378
01:33:47,270 --> 01:33:49,033
What's left of him.

1379
01:33:49,205 --> 01:33:51,969
You might wanna hose him down.
He smells like a rotten goat.

1380
01:33:54,844 --> 01:33:56,368
Uri.

1381
01:34:12,662 --> 01:34:14,596
<i>Da, Uri, I'm sorry.</i>

1382
01:34:14,764 --> 01:34:17,858
- But I still don't like it.
- I don't care what you like, Victor.

1383
01:34:18,034 --> 01:34:20,366
I'm in charge. Now, wait here.

1384
01:34:20,536 --> 01:34:23,699
Your last girl cost us 20 million.
One before, even more.

1385
01:34:23,873 --> 01:34:26,398
God knows how much
this one will cost us.

1386
01:34:26,576 --> 01:34:28,476
Victor, you're so cheap.

1387
01:34:34,383 --> 01:34:36,146
Can I come in?

1388
01:34:37,186 --> 01:34:41,555
Sorry to surprise you,
but I have something for you.

1389
01:34:43,392 --> 01:34:44,825
A token of my appreciation.

1390
01:34:46,429 --> 01:34:47,657
What's this for?

1391
01:34:48,097 --> 01:34:52,534
Please do not be insulted
but you have come to mean a lot to me...

1392
01:34:52,702 --> 01:34:55,865
...and I value much more
than just your service.

1393
01:34:56,038 --> 01:34:58,506
This is simply just a reflection
of my appreciation.

1394
01:35:00,409 --> 01:35:03,435
I would like to ask you
something personal.

1395
01:35:10,253 --> 01:35:11,777
Would you marry me?

1396
01:35:15,258 --> 01:35:17,317
Well, I think I might need
a couple of days.

1397
01:35:20,263 --> 01:35:22,060
Just to think about it.

1398
01:35:22,565 --> 01:35:24,157
Well, sure. Of course.

1399
01:35:26,269 --> 01:35:27,861
Sorry.

1400
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:32,230
Not now, Victor, I'm busy.

1401
01:35:35,945 --> 01:35:38,038
A very nice painting.

1402
01:35:39,415 --> 01:35:41,212
How long have you had it?

1403
01:35:41,817 --> 01:35:44,308
Years. Do you like it?

1404
01:35:46,856 --> 01:35:51,156
Beauty's a cruel mistress, is it not?

1405
01:35:54,964 --> 01:35:58,525
Victor, please come to join us.

1406
01:36:06,342 --> 01:36:08,936
Hello, Arch.

1407
01:36:09,211 --> 01:36:11,839
Shrouded and tied, just like the old days.

1408
01:36:12,014 --> 01:36:14,312
What is it today? The rack?

1409
01:36:14,483 --> 01:36:18,442
The garrote? Or is it the old
drowning-in-crayfish trick?

1410
01:36:18,621 --> 01:36:21,215
You're still full of hot air, Johnny.

1411
01:36:22,892 --> 01:36:24,917
You're looking a bit down.

1412
01:36:25,094 --> 01:36:27,995
Has that old clown
been working you long hours?

1413
01:36:28,164 --> 01:36:31,531
You always were loyal.
There's no dog like a loyal dog.

1414
01:36:31,968 --> 01:36:34,835
- Watch your mouth, John.
- Look at him, boys.

1415
01:36:35,838 --> 01:36:37,829
Scary, ain't he?

1416
01:36:38,007 --> 01:36:40,498
Well, that's what four years inside
does to a man.

1417
01:36:40,676 --> 01:36:42,735
It eats away at his soul...

1418
01:36:42,912 --> 01:36:47,281
...and when it's all gone,
it makes a man quite scary.

1419
01:36:48,451 --> 01:36:53,445
You ever wonder how you got in there?
What grass informed on you?

1420
01:37:04,266 --> 01:37:06,131
Hello, Archy.

1421
01:37:06,936 --> 01:37:09,166
Hey, Johnny boy. Look at you.

1422
01:37:09,338 --> 01:37:12,535
Look at this, Dave.
Don't you look the part.

1423
01:37:12,708 --> 01:37:16,439
Show us your guns, Uncle Arch.
I told the boys all about it.

1424
01:37:16,612 --> 01:37:19,547
Don't be cheeky. Get in the car.

1425
01:37:21,817 --> 01:37:23,011
Give us your money.

1426
01:37:23,185 --> 01:37:25,779
Give us that, in the car.

1427
01:37:34,964 --> 01:37:36,454
Be good boys...

1428
01:37:37,333 --> 01:37:40,131
...because you never know
who's watching.

1429
01:37:47,009 --> 01:37:49,910
So who we got in there, then?
Anyone I know?

1430
01:37:51,180 --> 01:37:52,442
Anyone famous?

1431
01:37:58,554 --> 01:38:00,647
Handsome Bob.

1432
01:38:02,091 --> 01:38:05,026
Mumbles, One Two.

1433
01:38:06,595 --> 01:38:10,361
I bet you could operate
a nice gas shower.

1434
01:38:10,533 --> 01:38:13,229
I could see you
with a couple of S's on your collar.

1435
01:38:13,402 --> 01:38:18,305
- Stiff goose in your step.
- Shut it, or you will get hurt.

1436
01:38:18,841 --> 01:38:21,833
That, Roman and Mickey,
is the famous Archy slap.

1437
01:38:23,712 --> 01:38:25,577
You shut it.

1438
01:38:25,748 --> 01:38:29,775
Or I'll do you myself,
you poisonous little toad.

1439
01:38:30,152 --> 01:38:34,088
Don't hurt me, Arch. I'm only little.

1440
01:38:34,990 --> 01:38:36,787
Get out.

1441
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:40,827
- Roll them out.
- Daddy.

1442
01:38:42,031 --> 01:38:44,431
Nice wheels.

1443
01:38:46,302 --> 01:38:48,031
Sorry about the painting.

1444
01:38:48,204 --> 01:38:51,298
I needed the cash
for a bit of the old dusty show biz.

1445
01:38:51,907 --> 01:38:52,931
So it's gone now.

1446
01:38:53,109 --> 01:38:55,907
Lost to the world
of degenerate, stoned no-hopers.

1447
01:38:56,078 --> 01:38:58,569
Never to be seen again
by the eye of a clean soul.

1448
01:39:01,016 --> 01:39:05,419
What are you, boy, if you are not poison?

1449
01:39:08,824 --> 01:39:12,055
Your dad couldn't even bear
to look at you.

1450
01:39:12,495 --> 01:39:15,430
So no wonder he fucked off
and left me to pick up the pieces.

1451
01:39:16,265 --> 01:39:18,631
But that wasn't enough for you.

1452
01:39:18,801 --> 01:39:21,861
You had to push your mom
into a bottle of pills...

1453
01:39:22,037 --> 01:39:23,902
...and a house full of nutters.

1454
01:39:24,073 --> 01:39:29,136
And all she got there
was a hot bath and a cold razor.

1455
01:39:29,712 --> 01:39:31,236
Why?

1456
01:39:32,715 --> 01:39:36,082
Because you're poison, John, that's why.

1457
01:39:38,554 --> 01:39:40,021
What can I say?

1458
01:39:40,189 --> 01:39:43,352
I'm a junkie, crackhead, no-gooder.

1459
01:39:43,526 --> 01:39:46,324
You should never have wasted
your money on that school.

1460
01:39:46,495 --> 01:39:47,792
Archy, get him out of here.

1461
01:39:49,331 --> 01:39:51,162
I've had enough of him.

1462
01:39:51,333 --> 01:39:54,097
I don't trust myself. Use someone else.

1463
01:39:55,938 --> 01:39:59,032
It's a gathering. I love a gathering.

1464
01:39:59,208 --> 01:40:02,871
Look. It's Mumbles, One Two.

1465
01:40:03,512 --> 01:40:07,744
Handsome Bob, all the old faces today.

1466
01:40:07,917 --> 01:40:10,977
And it was all going so well.

1467
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:13,210
Except for Archy.

1468
01:40:14,890 --> 01:40:16,118
Had to ruin the day.

1469
01:40:18,994 --> 01:40:21,087
I was gonna tell him
a story about you, Daddy.

1470
01:40:22,464 --> 01:40:25,399
I thought I'd tell him the story
about how you grassed him up.

1471
01:40:25,568 --> 01:40:27,661
Whoa, fuck!

1472
01:40:27,836 --> 01:40:32,296
Fucking hell, Len. Calm down.

1473
01:40:32,575 --> 01:40:33,735
Now, give us that.

1474
01:40:34,677 --> 01:40:37,145
That wasn't one of your best shots,
was it now, Daddy?

1475
01:40:37,913 --> 01:40:40,404
If you wanted to shut me up,
it should've been higher.

1476
01:40:40,583 --> 01:40:42,915
- Danny, come here.
- You're only 6 feet away.

1477
01:40:43,085 --> 01:40:44,347
Come here.

1478
01:40:46,388 --> 01:40:49,653
You get rid of him, Danny,
you understand?

1479
01:40:49,825 --> 01:40:52,020
Get rid of him.

1480
01:40:56,599 --> 01:41:00,160
You don't know
how much trouble you've caused...

1481
01:41:00,336 --> 01:41:04,864
...but please understand
that I will kill you very slowly...

1482
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:07,838
...if you don't tell me where my...

1483
01:41:08,010 --> 01:41:09,534
Hey, Archy.

1484
01:41:11,113 --> 01:41:12,512
The address is in my jacket.

1485
01:41:12,681 --> 01:41:15,115
I wouldn't mess you around, Archy,
it's in my jacket.

1486
01:41:23,792 --> 01:41:25,555
What does it say?

1487
01:41:35,037 --> 01:41:37,335
You want to know what it says, Len?

1488
01:41:39,942 --> 01:41:45,209
Funny thing about the law,
it can be quite flexible.

1489
01:41:45,981 --> 01:41:48,211
Because every time an informer...

1490
01:41:48,384 --> 01:41:52,184
...finds himself in front of a judge,
a secret letter...

1491
01:41:52,354 --> 01:41:56,347
...stands witness
as to the cooperation and efficiency...

1492
01:41:56,525 --> 01:41:57,890
<i>...of that informer.</i>

1493
01:41:58,060 --> 01:42:01,496
And if that informer
provides adequate information...

1494
01:42:01,664 --> 01:42:06,363
...then that dog of dogs
is magically released.

1495
01:42:06,535 --> 01:42:09,163
A sort of get-out-of-jail-free card.

1496
01:42:09,338 --> 01:42:11,067
And it comes with a very good alibi.

1497
01:42:11,974 --> 01:42:14,807
Now, you give us the names
of the people you want put down...

1498
01:42:14,977 --> 01:42:16,877
...and we'll get them the long sentences.

1499
01:42:17,046 --> 01:42:19,913
You can appear to reduce those terms
through your contacts.

1500
01:42:20,082 --> 01:42:24,212
We'll make you look like a fucking
guardian angel to the underworld.

1501
01:42:25,187 --> 01:42:26,211
Trusted throughout.

1502
01:42:26,388 --> 01:42:29,255
The only evidence
that will ever remain of this deal...

1503
01:42:29,425 --> 01:42:31,393
...comes in the form
of a very exclusive...

1504
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:34,393
...and hard-to-come-by legal document
called a secret dept.

1505
01:42:34,563 --> 01:42:38,431
As in deposition or handlers sheet.

1506
01:42:39,535 --> 01:42:41,799
Of course, the informer
always uses a false name.

1507
01:42:41,970 --> 01:42:43,403
What name do you like?

1508
01:42:43,572 --> 01:42:44,869
- Johnny?
- Tommy?

1509
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:47,531
You can have
Elvis fucking Presley if you fancy.

1510
01:42:47,710 --> 01:42:50,577
But I've seen this name
many times over the last 20 years.

1511
01:42:51,213 --> 01:42:52,407
<i>And I always wondered...</i>

1512
01:42:52,581 --> 01:42:55,573
Who is this Sidney Shaw, Len?

1513
01:42:56,485 --> 01:42:57,747
Nothing to do with you.

1514
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:00,445
- What name do you like the sound of?
- I like Sidney.

1515
01:43:00,989 --> 01:43:02,320
I like the sound of that.

1516
01:43:02,491 --> 01:43:05,483
Sidney Shaw. Sounds a bit like an actor.

1517
01:43:05,661 --> 01:43:08,095
You're free to go, Mr. Sidney Shaw.

1518
01:43:08,263 --> 01:43:10,060
No, they're setting me up, Archy.

1519
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:15,836
You are a very dirty bastard, Sidney.

1520
01:43:16,905 --> 01:43:19,135
You are a very dirty bastard indeed.

1521
01:43:20,876 --> 01:43:23,106
Cut that lot free,
get them out of here now.

1522
01:43:23,379 --> 01:43:25,643
No need to worry just yet, fellas.

1523
01:43:25,814 --> 01:43:28,783
Nothing's gonna happen
while we're standing in the lift.

1524
01:43:29,184 --> 01:43:31,778
They'd have to carry
the corpses over to the cars...

1525
01:43:31,954 --> 01:43:34,184
...and that's too much like hard work.

1526
01:43:34,690 --> 01:43:38,626
<i>In about two minutes from now,
when we're all walking along happily...</i>

1527
01:43:38,794 --> 01:43:42,491
...Danny boy over there is gonna turn
and pop me two in the head.

1528
01:43:45,434 --> 01:43:47,834
Then one in the throat just to be sure.

1529
01:43:49,438 --> 01:43:51,702
You shouldn't have
brought me here, fellas.

1530
01:43:51,874 --> 01:43:53,705
<i>You're just gonna end up as witnesses.</i>

1531
01:43:55,644 --> 01:43:57,942
Once they've "dealt" with us...

1532
01:43:59,148 --> 01:44:02,049
...they're gonna put our corpses
in the boot of a stolen car...

1533
01:44:02,217 --> 01:44:05,209
<i>...and pour 6 gallons of petrol on top.</i>

1534
01:44:05,387 --> 01:44:08,322
I can let your imagination fill in the rest.

1535
01:44:10,692 --> 01:44:13,160
But see now, Danny boy is rattled.

1536
01:44:14,496 --> 01:44:16,054
Because he knows that you know.

1537
01:44:16,231 --> 01:44:20,361
So he's gonna fire.

1538
01:44:39,121 --> 01:44:42,147
Mickey, pass me the gun.

1539
01:44:42,324 --> 01:44:45,157
Quickly. Quickly, Mickey.

1540
01:44:45,327 --> 01:44:48,592
Don't worry, he can't defend himself,
he's got no head.

1541
01:45:00,876 --> 01:45:02,537
May I please have some help, fellas?

1542
01:45:07,983 --> 01:45:09,382
Put your fucking hands up.

1543
01:45:19,461 --> 01:45:22,089
I think we should get out of here,
don't you, John?

1544
01:45:31,039 --> 01:45:32,973
Make the deal, come on.

1545
01:45:33,141 --> 01:45:36,668
Turn them in. It's not like
the first time you done it, is it?

1546
01:45:39,748 --> 01:45:42,376
Michael Finny, 10 years.

1547
01:45:43,685 --> 01:45:45,084
- Fred the Head.
- Fred the Head.

1548
01:45:45,254 --> 01:45:47,814
<i>Give him a five,
for a bank job he's about to pull.</i>

1549
01:45:47,990 --> 01:45:50,481
Here's the time and here's the place.

1550
01:45:50,659 --> 01:45:52,627
Frazier Nash, 15 years.

1551
01:45:52,794 --> 01:45:55,786
<i>One Two, just a two-stretch
to calm the flash fucker down.</i>

1552
01:45:56,665 --> 01:46:00,294
Cousin Ronnie got six years
because of you, you bastard.

1553
01:46:00,469 --> 01:46:02,994
<i>Mumbles thinks he's a clever boy,
so give him a three.</i>

1554
01:46:03,739 --> 01:46:06,105
Byron Dexter, eight years.

1555
01:46:06,275 --> 01:46:08,766
The Jew twins, 14 years.

1556
01:46:10,312 --> 01:46:13,645
The Jew twins, 14 years.

1557
01:46:13,815 --> 01:46:19,344
Archy, he's as loyal as a dog,
but he's getting a bit greedy. Four years.

1558
01:46:19,955 --> 01:46:21,149
<i>Four years for Archy.</i>

1559
01:46:22,424 --> 01:46:27,088
And of course me, Archy,
four long fucking years.

1560
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:42,499
<i>There is no spring without a winter.</i>

1561
01:46:42,778 --> 01:46:45,372
<i>No life without death.</i>

1562
01:46:45,714 --> 01:46:47,978
<i>And the demise of Lenny
has blown a new season...</i>

1563
01:46:48,150 --> 01:46:50,812
<i>...into the lungs of young Johnny.</i>

1564
01:46:53,121 --> 01:46:57,057
<i>Goodbye, Mr. Sidney Shaw.</i>

1565
01:46:59,861 --> 01:47:03,729
Well, it looks like that clinic
sorted you right out, Johnny boy.

1566
01:47:07,402 --> 01:47:08,528
You feeling better?

1567
01:47:09,705 --> 01:47:12,799
Well, I was. Until I saw youse twos.

1568
01:47:13,642 --> 01:47:17,339
I'm clean now. Straight, I gave it all up.

1569
01:47:17,512 --> 01:47:18,911
All but these little bastards.

1570
01:47:20,949 --> 01:47:22,382
Come on, give us a cuddle.

1571
01:47:24,286 --> 01:47:26,049
Welcome home.

1572
01:47:27,456 --> 01:47:30,755
- Give us your money, Arch.
- No, I can do better than that.

1573
01:47:30,926 --> 01:47:34,327
Turbo, show him
his welcome-home present.

1574
01:47:34,496 --> 01:47:36,896
What, you got me another coffin?

1575
01:47:39,501 --> 01:47:41,731
Goodbye, cruel world.

1576
01:47:44,506 --> 01:47:48,374
Now, I know how much you like the art, I
thought that would look good on your wall.

1577
01:47:48,777 --> 01:47:51,678
Someone's been telling you stories, Arch.

1578
01:47:52,014 --> 01:47:53,845
Now, that must've been expensive.

1579
01:47:54,716 --> 01:47:58,550
As it happens, it did cost
a very wealthy Russian an arm and a leg.

1580
01:48:00,956 --> 01:48:03,049
I see your music's back in the charts.

1581
01:48:03,225 --> 01:48:05,125
Well, that was when I was a RocknRolla.

1582
01:48:05,293 --> 01:48:06,851
Why, what you gonna be now, John?

1583
01:48:08,163 --> 01:48:10,131
You wanna watch out...

1584
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:13,732
...because I'm gonna be
just like you, uncle.

1585
01:48:13,902 --> 01:48:18,396
Now I'm gonna be a real RocknRolla.
