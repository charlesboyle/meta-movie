1
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:30,642
(singing)Well, I left New York 1949.

2
00:00:30,683 --> 00:00:34,725
(To)go across the country (wi)thout a dad-blame dime.

3
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,100
Montana in the cold, cold fall.

4
00:00:38,142 --> 00:00:42,142
Found my father in the gambling hall.

5
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:46,267
Father, Father where have you been?

6
00:00:47,517 --> 00:00:50,642
Been out here in the world since I was 10.

7
00:00:51,975 --> 00:00:56,433
Dear son, he said don't worry about me.

8
00:00:56,475 --> 00:00:59,517
I'm about to die of pleurisy.

9
00:01:02,267 --> 00:01:08,767
Cross the Mississippi, cross the Tennessee Cross the Niagara, home I'll never be.

10
00:01:08,808 --> 00:01:16,433
Home in Ol'Medora, home in Ol' Truckee Apalachicola, home I'll never be.

11
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:22,267
For better or worse, through thick and thin.

12
00:01:22,308 --> 00:01:26,433
Like being married to the little woman.

13
00:01:28,475 --> 00:01:32,392
God loved me just like I loved him.

14
00:01:34,475 --> 00:01:37,100
Wants you to do just the same for him.

15
00:01:39,907 --> 00:01:42,225
Well, the worms eat away but don't worry, watch thewind.

16
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:45,933
The worms eat away but don't worry watch the wind.

17
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:50,725
So I left Montana in an ol'freight train.

18
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:55,350
The night my father died in the cold, cold rain.

19
00:01:55,391 --> 00:02:03,016
Rode up to Opelousas, rode to Wounded Knee, Rode to Ogallala, home I'll never be.

20
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:11,308
Rode to Oklahoma, rode to El Cajon Rode to Tehachapi, rode to San Antone.

21
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:21,808
Home I'll never be Home I'll never be Home I'll never be.

22
00:02:34,225 --> 00:02:35,683
ON THE ROAD

23
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:47,225
Got room for one more?

24
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:48,516
Yeah, sure, hop in.

25
00:02:48,558 --> 00:02:49,641
There's room for everybody.

26
00:02:49,641 --> 00:02:52,516
Alright.

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,350
Thanks, brother !

28
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:58,558
Whooooee !

29
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,933
Here we go !

30
00:02:59,975 --> 00:03:01,391
Hang on, brother, hang on.

31
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:05,933
Where you guys from?

32
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:07,308
North Dakota.

33
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,683
We're headed for the harvest.

34
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:11,058
Thanks.

35
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,058
What about you?

36
00:03:22,683 --> 00:03:23,558
Montana.

37
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,891
So, you going someplace, or you just going?

38
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,058
I guess I'm just going.

39
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,058
You got any money?

40
00:03:35,183 --> 00:03:38,016
I got enough for a pint of whiskey till we reach Denver.

41
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,433
You reckon if we put them things in the ground, something will grow up?

42
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,141
(laughs)If I get hungry enough, I plan to eat them raw !

43
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,100
(laughs)I'll share them with you !

44
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,725
Aww.

45
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:15,141
(singing) Oh I got a pretty little girl.

46
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:18,266
She's sweet sixteen.

47
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:22,433
She's the prettiest little thing.

48
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:24,558
You ever seen.

49
00:04:28,683 --> 00:04:30,141
I got a pretty little girl.

50
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:33,391
She's sweet sixteen.

51
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:37,933
She's the prettiest little thing.

52
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:39,808
You ever seen.

53
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:54,391
(All join)Oh I got a pretty little girl. She's sweet sixteen. She's the prettiest little thing I ever seen.

54
00:05:12,724 --> 00:05:14,641
Five months earlier.

55
00:05:16,058 --> 00:05:18,099
Leo Paradise loved many things.

56
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:22,433
Though part of him never left his native Quebec, when.

57
00:05:22,474 --> 00:05:27,558
he moved to this country with his dear wife Gabrielle, heloved it with all his heart.

58
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:35,516
Now, he joins his departed son Gerard in a better place.

59
00:05:35,558 --> 00:05:36,558
Are you all right?

60
00:05:37,974 --> 00:05:38,762
In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

61
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:40,191
I'm all right.

62
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:40,724
I'm good.

63
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:11,933
I first met Dean not long after my father died.

64
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:17,003
I'd just gotten over a serious illness that I won't bother to talk about

65
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:20,434
except that it really had something to do with my father's death,

66
00:06:20,435 --> 00:06:22,346
and my awful feeling that everything was dead.

67
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:40,099
"Let's go for a drink", says my buddy Sal.

68
00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:43,849
But I show up and guess what — no Sal Paradise.

69
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:48,516
A boring, brooding mute has been inserted in his place.

70
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:49,683
Oh really, Carlo.

71
00:06:49,724 --> 00:06:51,308
Well, what's there to talk about exactly?

72
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:53,266
The book I'm not writing?

73
00:06:53,308 --> 00:06:54,599
The inspiration I don't feel?

74
00:06:54,641 --> 00:06:57,058
Even the beer's flat.

75
00:06:57,099 --> 00:06:58,683
I mean, look around, man.

76
00:06:58,683 --> 00:06:59,933
Everything's stultified.

77
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:01,891
True, but these are temporary worries.

78
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:04,308
Life is long and wondrous and strange.

79
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:06,349
Look at me, Sal.

80
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:07,433
I'm full of inspiration.

81
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:10,974
My mind is a veritable echo chamber of epiphanies.

82
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:15,141
Dig it "The air is dark.

83
00:07:15,183 --> 00:07:18,474
The night is sad...

84
00:07:19,391 --> 00:07:20,891
I'll get you another beer !

85
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:22,849
Bravo, very nice, Carlo !

86
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:23,349
Chad.

87
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:25,558
I've been looking all over town for you hoodlums.

88
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,266
How you doing, man?

89
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:27,224
Listen, remember that thing?

90
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:29,849
Jailbird friend of mine from Denver?

91
00:07:29,891 --> 00:07:31,141
The one that stole 500 cars?

92
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:33,058
The one I've been raving about?

93
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:36,183
He didn't think we really believed that, did he?

94
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:38,636
First reports of Dean came to me through Chad King,

95
00:07:38,637 --> 00:07:41,003
who'd shown me and Carlo a few letters from him,

96
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:43,332
writtenfrom a Colorado reform school.

97
00:07:43,516 --> 00:07:45,224
Come on man, let's go !

98
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:46,724
The great Dean awaits !

99
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:51,849
Dean had arrived in New York.

100
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:55,974
He'd just married a 16- year-old chick named Marylou.

101
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:56,766
New York, 1947.

102
00:07:58,516 --> 00:07:59,266
Come on, gentlemen.

103
00:07:59,308 --> 00:07:59,683
One more.

104
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:23,724
Well, now, look who's at my doorstep, old Chad King !

105
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:26,766
How's it going, cowboy?

106
00:08:26,808 --> 00:08:27,391
I'm Sal.

107
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:28,141
Sal.

108
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:29,933
Strong grip.

109
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:31,891
Yes, yes, yes !

110
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:33,933
Sal and Carlo, the writer pals.

111
00:08:33,974 --> 00:08:36,391
I've heard all about you gone cats.

112
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,849
We're going to orient you into the Nietzschean ways of the big bad city.

113
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:41,641
And smoke your weed, of course.

114
00:08:41,641 --> 00:08:43,057
Well, yes, we got plenty of that !

115
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:46,391
Marylou, why don't you get on the ball and make us some coffee?

116
00:08:46,432 --> 00:08:49,391
My writer friends are here Come on in.

117
00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:50,141
Hey hey !

118
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:51,932
Take your shoes off.

119
00:08:52,016 --> 00:08:52,932
Yeah?

120
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:53,682
No, I'm just kidding.

121
00:08:57,391 --> 00:09:02,286
(singing) Cry to hear folks chatter

122
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:08,955
And I know you cheat

123
00:09:10,227 --> 00:09:13,563
Right or wrong don't matter

124
00:09:14,948 --> 00:09:15,511
When you're with me, sweet...

125
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:16,891
Yes...

126
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,349
You'll never get this one.

127
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:19,897
(singing)Yipra (and continues)

128
00:09:25,373 --> 00:09:26,186
That's not a song.

129
00:09:31,224 --> 00:09:31,932
Yipra (etc.

130
00:09:33,932 --> 00:09:34,682
Slim Gaillard

131
00:09:35,432 --> 00:09:36,932
Yes, yes, yes !

132
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:37,724
Slim it is.

133
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:38,349
Dean.

134
00:09:38,391 --> 00:09:41,182
Some of us need the occasional doughnut to survive

135
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:42,307
Ah, "the occasional doughnut".

136
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,224
I just love this gal !

137
00:09:45,182 --> 00:09:45,891
Yipra !

138
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,307
And wake up, Chad King.

139
00:09:57,807 --> 00:09:58,766
Thanks.

140
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:03,141
It's nice to have someone paying attention.

141
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:16,224
I mean, it's really nice having someone pay attention !

142
00:10:17,974 --> 00:10:19,974
You know, I never met a girl before who could roll tea.

143
00:10:19,974 --> 00:10:21,099
Oh yeah?

144
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:22,516
Yipra...

145
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:30,391
My friend !

146
00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:33,016
(Book title) Swann's Way

147
00:10:53,974 --> 00:11:00,724
The day before my father died, he took hold of my hand and he looked at it.

148
00:11:00,766 --> 00:11:06,891
And he said, "You got no calluses, Sal.

149
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:11,016
That's because you don't do any real fucking work, boy !

150
00:11:11,057 --> 00:11:12,349
"Oh, yeah?

151
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:17,099
Yeah.

152
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:24,141
My old man's still lost.

153
00:11:24,182 --> 00:11:27,766
Just wandering the hobo streets of Denver like...

154
00:11:27,807 --> 00:11:30,266
like shit.

155
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,349
To the old men

156
00:11:42,932 --> 00:11:43,724
Yeah.

157
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:51,766
To the good, old, dead, demented men we love.

158
00:11:51,807 --> 00:11:54,182
And to the West.

159
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:30,974
There you go

160
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:53,682
It wasn't only because I was a writer and needed new experiences that I wanted to know Dean more.

161
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:57,890
But because somehow he reminded me of some long lost brother.

162
00:12:57,932 --> 00:13:05,307
In the West, he'd spent a third of his time in the pool hall, a third in jail, and a third in the public library.

163
00:13:13,807 --> 00:13:19,807
All my New York friends were giving their tired, bookish political or psychoanalytical reasons for being in the negative.

164
00:13:19,849 --> 00:13:21,807
But Dean just raced in society.

165
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:25,432
I began to learn from him as much as he probably learned from me.

166
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,057
Oh yeah

167
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:50,682
Here's a cat who can really bend his girl, man !

168
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,432
Do you even know what we witnessed right there, Sal?

169
00:14:43,474 --> 00:14:45,390
That tenor-man has it.

170
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:54,932
You see, he starts with the first chorus, then lines up his ideas, rises through his fate, and then suddenly, somewhere in the middle of the chorus, he gets it.

171
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:57,599
Everybody looks up and knows.

172
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,099
Time stops.

173
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:04,753
He has to blow across bridges and come back with such infinite feeling for the tune of the moment,

174
00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:07,840
that everyone knows that it's not the tune that counts, but it.

175
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:14,140
"It-man", can I buy you that drink?

176
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:17,265
Make that three.

177
00:15:18,557 --> 00:15:19,599
I'll buy you one.

178
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,307
Alright.

179
00:15:21,307 --> 00:15:24,599
Thanks What's your name, man?

180
00:15:27,682 --> 00:15:29,224
(laughs)They want to know my name !

181
00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:50,848
There's some boys from work.

182
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,390
Hi, boys from work.

183
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:54,473
Howdy.

184
00:15:54,515 --> 00:15:57,723
So, where was I?...

185
00:15:57,765 --> 00:15:59,932
So there's this whore house.

186
00:15:59,973 --> 00:16:02,432
There's this monkey at the door.

187
00:16:02,473 --> 00:16:04,307
So you...

188
00:16:04,307 --> 00:16:09,432
you place your bet in the cage, you know, and the monkey rolls the cage around, and the dice roll out...

189
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:14,265
And if you win, you get the girl for free.

190
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:20,848
But if you loose to that monkey, you gonna get your backside "bitched" !

191
00:16:22,223 --> 00:16:23,140
By the monkey !

192
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,807
Now that's an evolution.

193
00:16:24,807 --> 00:16:26,265
"Sodom andGorilla".

194
00:16:26,307 --> 00:16:28,640
I ain't telling no lie !

195
00:16:30,848 --> 00:16:31,557
That's cool.

196
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:37,848
So what is it like being with a white woman?

197
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,432
I always wondered.

198
00:16:42,057 --> 00:16:43,140
I'd say it's like...

199
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:46,723
You never been with a white woman before?

200
00:16:46,723 --> 00:16:49,932
(No...) Been with a white man.

201
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,140
Ozone Park, Queens.

202
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,223
Come in, man.

203
00:16:57,265 --> 00:16:58,348
Memere !

204
00:16:58,598 --> 00:17:00,098
C'est l'bon gars que j'tai parle.

205
00:17:01,098 --> 00:17:02,432
Le chum a Chad, de Denver.

206
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:03,765
Howdy'do, Ma !

207
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:04,598
Hello.

208
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,557
You look just like her.

209
00:17:07,598 --> 00:17:08,557
Come on, man.

210
00:17:08,598 --> 00:17:10,473
Where's Marylou?

211
00:17:10,473 --> 00:17:11,307
Oh, man.

212
00:17:11,307 --> 00:17:14,432
We get into a big ruckus, so she calls the cops on me.

213
00:17:14,473 --> 00:17:17,515
Then she whores a few bucks together and heads back to Denver.

214
00:17:17,557 --> 00:17:18,515
Whoa, really?

215
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:19,348
Yeah.

216
00:17:20,598 --> 00:17:22,473
You know, I'm planning on heading back, too.

217
00:17:22,515 --> 00:17:23,848
When?

218
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,098
You know, soon.

219
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,432
Anyways, before I go, I absolutely have to learn how to write from you.

220
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:31,432
Well, I'm honored, man, but I...

221
00:17:31,473 --> 00:17:32,098
Show me how !

222
00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:33,140
Alright?

223
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,265
I want to learn.

224
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:35,348
Teach me.

225
00:17:48,223 --> 00:17:49,057
Alright, then.

226
00:17:49,098 --> 00:17:51,265
Alright, let's see.

227
00:18:00,515 --> 00:18:02,807
"The cowboy thinks I'm some kind of genius.

228
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,223
He's leaning over my shoulder right now.

229
00:18:08,557 --> 00:18:10,765
We gotta forget the Western stuff.

230
00:18:10,765 --> 00:18:13,515
Turn ourselves into the Eastern jazz.

231
00:18:13,515 --> 00:18:14,557
What about.

232
00:18:14,557 --> 00:18:14,932
Hey.

233
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:27,765
I was walking down 125th street and suddenly I stopped.

234
00:18:29,515 --> 00:18:30,765
I looked at everything in amazement.

235
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:34,956
It was like I'd just woken up from a dream that had lasted my whole life,

236
00:18:34,957 --> 00:18:39,084
and I realized that God isn't somewhere out there in Heaven, he's right here.

237
00:18:39,182 --> 00:18:40,182
Yes.

238
00:18:40,223 --> 00:18:41,265
In the dirt.

239
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:42,723
He's an ape like us.

240
00:18:42,765 --> 00:18:44,098
Buh.

241
00:18:51,557 --> 00:18:55,848
And I shambled after as usual, as I have done my whole life, after the people that interested me.

242
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,390
'Cause the only people that interest me are the mad ones.

243
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:12,723
The ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones that never yawn and say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn, like Roman candles across the night.

244
00:19:24,556 --> 00:19:27,431
BUS TRAFFIC ANNOUNCEMENT
... service from Albany and Poughkeepsie...

245
00:19:27,473 --> 00:19:31,640
is now arriving at door number 3...

246
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:30,848
Come on.

247
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:31,765
Yes, Ma'am.

248
00:19:33,265 --> 00:19:34,598
Where did you get the suit?

249
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:36,473
11 dollars on 3rd av'.

250
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:38,265
Come on, guys, concentrate.

251
00:19:47,265 --> 00:19:47,848
Let's see.

252
00:19:52,765 --> 00:19:53,806
For you.

253
00:19:56,473 --> 00:19:57,931
And I'll keep this one.

254
00:19:57,973 --> 00:20:03,181
Sal, Sal, Sal

255
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:04,140
I'll miss you guys.

256
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,348
To the West-orooni !

257
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,598
To the West-orooni.

258
00:20:14,973 --> 00:20:16,015
Don't forget to write, Carlo.

259
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:17,348
Don't do anything I wouldn't do !

260
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:21,973
I will.

261
00:21:23,431 --> 00:21:24,890
Alas, alas, Sal.

262
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,681
It's not me, I'm drunk.

263
00:21:26,723 --> 00:21:33,348
But my soul talking direct soul language, so to speak, to my deepest blood brother and holy goof—that's you.

264
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:39,431
And to be formal and analytical about it, let me objectify the characteristics I miss the most of you.

265
00:21:39,473 --> 00:21:41,640
Number 1 your conversation.

266
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:45,556
Number 2 your brotherly smile, man.

267
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:51,556
But I shall go on, so to close and get the gist Denver waits for you.

268
00:21:51,598 --> 00:21:57,515
Carlo in his damp grotto and clowned misery —to use a paradox of expression— waits for you, so get on it !

269
00:21:57,556 --> 00:22:00,848
Be quick and hurry to me, no delay.

270
00:22:00,848 --> 00:22:01,931
Long dash.

271
00:22:03,348 --> 00:22:04,848
Bring Paradise to Denver.

272
00:22:07,515 --> 00:22:08,765
Bring Paradise to Denver.

273
00:22:08,848 --> 00:22:11,390
And I love you as ever.

274
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:12,681
Dean.

275
00:22:14,098 --> 00:22:14,848
Drunk.

276
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:45,473
With the coming of Dean Moriarty, began the part of my life you could call "My life on the Road".

277
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:51,973
Before that, I'd often dreamed of going West —always vaguely planning but never cutting out.

278
00:22:56,181 --> 00:22:58,598
I was a young writer, trying to take off.

279
00:23:31,598 --> 00:23:33,848
43 W80 C degrees in Clarion...

280
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,889
Dawson County, Nebraska.

281
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:56,931
Now what species are you?

282
00:23:58,014 --> 00:23:58,806
Traveler.

283
00:24:00,348 --> 00:24:01,389
I appreciate the lift.

284
00:24:03,431 --> 00:24:04,639
... It might be your last !

285
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:06,806
I'm freighting dynamite.

286
00:24:14,306 --> 00:24:15,431
You looking for that toe?

287
00:24:15,431 --> 00:24:18,264
They amputated it this morning.

288
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:23,098
You can't smoke, but you can drink in this car.

289
00:24:23,139 --> 00:24:25,431
Alright Thanks.

290
00:24:28,098 --> 00:24:29,931
"Follow me, I'm right behind you.

291
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,056
" Did it hurt?

292
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:37,598
I don't recommend it !

293
00:24:54,264 --> 00:24:55,889
voice of (low) Shoot I gotta take me a piss.

294
00:24:55,931 --> 00:25:00,348
A truck with a flat board at the back with about six or seven boys sprawled out on it.

295
00:25:00,389 --> 00:25:01,973
Piss call.

296
00:25:02,014 --> 00:25:04,848
Woo-ee !

297
00:25:04,931 --> 00:25:05,681
Here we go !

298
00:25:05,681 --> 00:25:07,431
-yelled the kid in the baseball cap.

299
00:25:07,431 --> 00:25:10,473
We been riding this son of a bitch since Des Moines !

300
00:25:10,514 --> 00:25:12,264
These guys never stop!

301
00:25:12,306 --> 00:25:19,306
Every now and then you have to yell for piss call, otherwise you have to piss off the air and hang on brother, hang on!

302
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:27,681
Denver, Colorado

303
00:25:30,223 --> 00:25:30,931
Thanks a lot, guys

304
00:25:38,014 --> 00:25:40,223
N IN THE STREET (low) I know, it's.

305
00:25:56,431 --> 00:25:58,181
I hope you're not paying rent on this place !

306
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:01,431
(laughs)Oh, my angel-headed Sal is here at last !

307
00:26:02,514 --> 00:26:03,598
Good to see you.

308
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:04,431
You, too.

309
00:26:04,473 --> 00:26:06,806
So, what are you doing?

310
00:26:06,848 --> 00:26:07,431
I mean.

311
00:26:09,056 --> 00:26:10,264
What exactly are you doing?

312
00:26:10,306 --> 00:26:14,431
I am vacuuming at May Company by day.

313
00:26:14,431 --> 00:26:15,389
Uhmm...

314
00:26:15,389 --> 00:26:16,222
Impressive.

315
00:26:16,222 --> 00:26:16,889
... I know.

316
00:26:16,931 --> 00:26:20,639
And chasing our beloved, feral, mad dog by night.

317
00:26:20,681 --> 00:26:22,014
And where is Dean?

318
00:26:22,056 --> 00:26:22,431
What's the schedule?

319
00:26:22,431 --> 00:26:25,014
So, I got off work a half hour ago.

320
00:26:25,097 --> 00:26:27,889
At that time, Dean is screwing Marylou at the hotel.

321
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:31,681
At one sharp, he goes from Marylou to Camille, the new girl.

322
00:26:31,681 --> 00:26:37,139
Of course, neither knows what's going on, but he screws her once, giving me time to arrive at 130.

323
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:41,264
Then we go out for our unfinished business until 6 in the morning.

324
00:26:41,306 --> 00:26:43,472
"Unfinished business"?

325
00:26:44,472 --> 00:26:49,847
Dean and I are trying to communicate with absolute honesty and completeness everything in our minds.

326
00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:51,556
We do it on Benzedrine.

327
00:26:51,597 --> 00:26:54,776
And then at 6, he goes back to Marylou and spends the rest of the day

328
00:26:54,777 --> 00:26:57,151
running around trying to sort out the necessary papers for the divorce.

329
00:26:57,306 --> 00:27:00,889
All that he wants to do is go back to San Francisco and marry Camille.

330
00:27:00,889 --> 00:27:02,514
It's sick !

331
00:27:02,597 --> 00:27:04,722
And I bet she's incredibly ugly.

332
00:27:05,764 --> 00:27:07,847
Like Helen of Troy with a fucking brain.

333
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:12,389
What are you doing?

334
00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:14,306
(whispers)Camille really hates me right now.

335
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:20,056
Why, Sal !

336
00:27:22,222 --> 00:27:23,306
(laughs)Yes, you've arrived !

337
00:27:23,347 --> 00:27:26,431
You finally got on that old road, didn't you?

338
00:27:26,472 --> 00:27:27,264
I did.

339
00:27:30,556 --> 00:27:33,639
Look here, Camille, it's my good buddy Sal from New York.

340
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:38,556
Sorry for not getting up, Sal, but I wasn't expecting company at this hour.

341
00:27:38,597 --> 00:27:39,514
I'm sorry.

342
00:27:39,556 --> 00:27:40,347
I should leave.

343
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:46,347
It's Sal's first time in Denver and I think it's absolutely necessary for me to take him out and fix him up with a girl.

344
00:27:46,347 --> 00:27:47,306
Right now?

345
00:27:47,347 --> 00:27:51,431
I should be back no later than 314 for our hour of reverie, darling.

346
00:27:51,472 --> 00:27:53,597
Works all day, runs around all night.

347
00:27:53,681 --> 00:27:55,347
He never eats, he never sleeps...

348
00:27:55,347 --> 00:27:56,264
Ain't she something?

349
00:27:56,264 --> 00:27:57,389
The man thinks he's Superman.

350
00:27:57,431 --> 00:27:58,347
Yeah.

351
00:27:58,389 --> 00:28:00,806
As I said, not 3 but 314.

352
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:05,431
Now are we straight in the most wonderful and deepest depths of our soul, dear darling?

353
00:28:08,347 --> 00:28:09,722
Is he offering me a choice?

354
00:28:09,764 --> 00:28:12,014
I don't think he's offering you a choice, no.

355
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:16,764
Hee-hee !

356
00:28:16,806 --> 00:28:18,472
Yes.

357
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:26,014
You look like a smart guy.

358
00:28:27,097 --> 00:28:29,847
I bet you're wondering what he sees in me, huh?

359
00:28:31,847 --> 00:28:33,056
Respectability?

360
00:28:34,431 --> 00:28:35,389
Very good.

361
00:28:35,431 --> 00:28:36,806
I'm impressed.

362
00:28:38,597 --> 00:28:40,097
Let's go to work, babies.

363
00:28:40,139 --> 00:28:43,764
So now that you're sleeping with half of Denver, are there any girls left for me?

364
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:45,597
Well now listen here, Sal.

365
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:49,056
I know a girl named Rita and Rita cannot wait to meet you.

366
00:28:49,056 --> 00:28:50,722
We'll go there at once !

367
00:28:50,722 --> 00:28:51,889
I thought we were going to talk.

368
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:53,389
Yes, yes, after.

369
00:28:53,389 --> 00:28:56,181
If you want to know my true nature, at this moment?

370
00:28:56,222 --> 00:28:59,389
I'm one of those people who goes around showing his cock to juvenile delinquents.

371
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:02,639
(Sal laughs)Oh, these Denver doldrums...

372
00:29:02,681 --> 00:29:05,681
Isn't he the finest, smartest fellow in the world?

373
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:21,514
You know that old guy?

374
00:29:23,056 --> 00:29:24,347
I thought it was my pops.

375
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,556
Carlo, wait up !

376
00:29:31,806 --> 00:29:32,681
Voila.

377
00:29:41,805 --> 00:29:42,472
Darling.

378
00:29:43,472 --> 00:29:45,805
Bless me father, for I will sin.

379
00:29:52,097 --> 00:29:53,514
Yum, yum, yum

380
00:29:59,555 --> 00:30:00,805
It's nice to have you boys.

381
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:07,222
What's so funny, my boy?

382
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,514
I'm checking my pulse.

383
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:13,805
Round two-sie, here we go !

384
00:30:17,972 --> 00:30:18,930
It happens.

385
00:30:19,805 --> 00:30:20,722
My hands...

386
00:30:23,764 --> 00:30:24,472
Mine does.

387
00:30:44,930 --> 00:31:13,222
I was filled with guilt.

388
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:16,097
I thought he said she was my girl.

389
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,222
Nothing for you or me, Sal.

390
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,597
Everything and everyone for that faithless bitch !

391
00:31:26,305 --> 00:31:27,805
Guess who I hear !

392
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:32,514
Carlo, come on.

393
00:31:32,555 --> 00:31:33,139
No.

394
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:33,597
Come on.

395
00:31:33,597 --> 00:31:33,805
No.

396
00:31:33,847 --> 00:31:34,430
Come on.

397
00:31:34,514 --> 00:31:34,930
No.

398
00:31:34,972 --> 00:31:35,430
Come on.

399
00:31:35,514 --> 00:31:36,847
No no no no no

400
00:31:36,847 --> 00:31:38,972
Sal No No.

401
00:31:39,014 --> 00:31:39,889
Sal Argh .

402
00:31:43,055 --> 00:31:44,972
Rebop Sal, come on.

403
00:31:45,014 --> 00:31:47,722
Yeah-oh...

404
00:31:48,514 --> 00:31:49,639
No clothes party.

405
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:04,555
You enjoying?

406
00:32:04,597 --> 00:32:08,222
Yeah, but now I'm finishing up my degree here in Denver.

407
00:32:08,264 --> 00:32:11,472
Dean told me you do, uh, set design...

408
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:13,055
Set design, yeah.

409
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,180
That's interesting.

410
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:18,055
The one I enjoyed most designing was, uh, "Desire Under the Elms".

411
00:32:18,097 --> 00:32:19,264
It's a great play.

412
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:20,139
Yeah.

413
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,597
Eugene O'Neill.

414
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:24,264
Yeah, I know it's Eugene O'Neill, Carlo.

415
00:32:24,305 --> 00:32:25,180
Thank you.

416
00:32:25,222 --> 00:32:29,055
There's like a rusty nail scratching across my goddam spinal cord.

417
00:32:30,097 --> 00:32:32,139
Dean, "I've got the world on a string"?

418
00:32:32,305 --> 00:32:33,514
Yes, you do.

419
00:33:01,764 --> 00:33:02,347
Come on !

420
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:06,805
Don't tell me you New York intellectuals don't dance

421
00:33:07,597 --> 00:33:13,972
(Ella Fitzgerald) I've got the world on a string, sitting on a rainbow.

422
00:33:14,013 --> 00:33:16,305
Got the string...

423
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:29,097
around my finger... Oh, what a world, what a life, I'm in love...

424
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:36,722
You didn't say you had a nice voice.

425
00:33:36,763 --> 00:33:38,555
I don't have a nice voice.

426
00:33:38,597 --> 00:33:39,555
Yeah.

427
00:33:39,597 --> 00:33:41,097
Yeah, you do.

428
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,472
Thanks.

429
00:33:45,555 --> 00:33:47,305
Are you staying in Denver very long?

430
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,222
I got the feeling I won't be staying very long.

431
00:33:55,263 --> 00:33:57,388
Yeah.

432
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,138
"Not enough hours in the day.

433
00:34:01,055 --> 00:34:02,013
"Right.

434
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:06,888
then.

435
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:09,597
singing along.

436
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,472
What a world, what a life, I'm in love...

437
00:34:20,805 --> 00:34:24,676
(reading)"Assuming for yourself the sorrow of my body

438
00:34:24,677 --> 00:34:28,091
Thus, when you solace me in my desire

439
00:34:28,092 --> 00:34:32,466
I held your body, and lay beside it sleeping

440
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:35,387
Feeling the pain of your own inward fire"

441
00:34:36,388 --> 00:34:38,680
"Weeping myself to hear your silent weeping" .

442
00:34:44,972 --> 00:34:45,972
Has Dean read this?

443
00:34:47,847 --> 00:34:52,972
I've gotten so crazy over Dean that all his stupid friends call me "Carlo in Wonderland".

444
00:34:53,013 --> 00:34:54,805
Clever, huh?

445
00:34:54,847 --> 00:34:55,888
Ah, yes...

446
00:34:55,930 --> 00:35:02,180
They don't understand this is the first time actual sex has been...

447
00:35:02,222 --> 00:35:05,347
part of my relationship with a man.

448
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:08,680
This is how you love.

449
00:35:12,722 --> 00:35:14,680
I'm not in fucking wonderland.

450
00:35:14,722 --> 00:35:16,180
I know it's not a man he wants.

451
00:35:16,222 --> 00:35:19,347
I even told him we can take sexuality out of it, just...

452
00:35:23,097 --> 00:35:24,138
"Be with me, man.

453
00:35:26,805 --> 00:35:27,763
Hold me.

454
00:35:30,055 --> 00:35:31,097
Just call me."

455
00:35:31,138 --> 00:35:37,222
And he always promises, "Yes, Carlo, yes, man - I'll call you.

456
00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:38,263
I'll call you."

457
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:40,263
Who the fuck am I kidding?

458
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:44,638
I can't even call what I feel "a heartache", it's too banal.

459
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,763
"Melancholy" is too languorous.

460
00:35:46,805 --> 00:35:51,430
"Grief" is closest.

461
00:35:54,972 --> 00:35:55,805
I'm 21.

462
00:35:55,805 --> 00:35:59,097
By the time I'm 23 I'm going to write one great poem.

463
00:35:59,097 --> 00:36:01,347
Then it's all over for me.

464
00:36:06,847 --> 00:36:09,347
Sal, I'm leaving.

465
00:36:12,222 --> 00:36:12,972
I'm going to Africa.

466
00:36:13,013 --> 00:36:14,972
A la Rimbaud, non?

467
00:36:15,013 --> 00:36:17,263
I might jump ship at Dakar.

468
00:36:17,263 --> 00:36:19,222
I'm gonna smoke opium.

469
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:25,305
And I will pick up dark, mysterious men.

470
00:36:25,347 --> 00:36:27,680
And they will love me.

471
00:36:39,805 --> 00:36:41,263
I really wish I could drink whiskey like a man.

472
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:48,055
I know those guys are like, "Hey, do a shot !"

473
00:37:00,555 --> 00:37:06,971
Home in Missoula, Home in Truckee, Home in Opelousas, Ain't no home for me.

474
00:37:07,013 --> 00:37:14,933
Home in Ol'Medora, Home in Wounded Knee, Home in Ogallala, Home I'll never be.

475
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:45,013
Excuse me, miss.

476
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:47,513
I can't seem to find an empty seat anywhere.

477
00:37:47,555 --> 00:37:49,846
May I?

478
00:37:50,846 --> 00:37:52,180
If you wish.

479
00:38:04,388 --> 00:38:04,971
I'm Sal.

480
00:38:07,305 --> 00:38:07,805
Terry.

481
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,013
Selma, California.

482
00:39:24,471 --> 00:39:25,596
No tienes hambre?

483
00:39:27,513 --> 00:39:28,805
Que pasa Papa?

484
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,055
You want to love me now?

485
00:40:37,013 --> 00:40:38,596
Cesar 1,20.

486
00:40:42,263 --> 00:40:44,804
Matilde 1,10.

487
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,054
Terry 1,15.

488
00:40:54,471 --> 00:40:55,346
Terry.

489
00:40:56,304 --> 00:40:58,263
Sal 1,05.

490
00:40:59,221 --> 00:41:00,179
Sal.

491
00:41:03,804 --> 00:41:05,846
Maria 1,15.

492
00:41:05,888 --> 00:41:07,888
You growing roots?

493
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,638
Jasmine 1,10.

494
00:41:23,263 --> 00:41:27,054
The harvest is ending, and it's getting much colder in the nights.

495
00:41:27,096 --> 00:41:30,596
Terry and I bitterly decided we'd have to leave.

496
00:41:32,138 --> 00:41:37,513
She was supposed to come to New York in a month with her brother, but we both knew she wouldn't make it.

497
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:43,054
I can feel the pull of my own life calling me back.

498
00:41:44,554 --> 00:41:45,596
I still have a book to write.

499
00:41:57,346 --> 00:41:59,346
(very low)We screw one more time, then you leave...

500
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:09,763
See you in New York, Terry !

501
00:43:19,721 --> 00:43:20,596
Wait.

502
00:43:28,846 --> 00:43:29,513
Thanks.

503
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:35,679
You know what they did to me in that prison?

504
00:43:35,721 --> 00:43:38,554
Solitary confinement, and a Bible.

505
00:43:38,596 --> 00:43:41,137
I used it to sit on the stone floor.

506
00:43:41,179 --> 00:43:44,647
But when they seen that I did that, they took away that Bible,

507
00:43:44,648 --> 00:43:48,998
and they brought back a little pocket size one, like so big, and I couldn't sit on it.

508
00:43:49,804 --> 00:43:52,721
You know why I been in prison my whole life?

509
00:43:52,721 --> 00:43:58,387
When I was 13 years old, I was in a movie with a boy, and he makes a crack about my mother.

510
00:43:58,429 --> 00:44:00,637
You know, that dirty word.

511
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:04,096
So I take out my jackknife and I cut up his throat.

512
00:44:04,137 --> 00:44:06,929
I would have killed him if they hadn't drug me off.

513
00:44:06,929 --> 00:44:12,887
The judge says "Henry, you know what you were doing when you attacked your friend?

514
00:44:12,929 --> 00:44:15,804
" I say, "Yes sir, YourHonor, I want to kill that son-of-a-bitch.

515
00:44:18,096 --> 00:44:18,804
" And I still do.

516
00:44:34,221 --> 00:44:35,137
Bah !

517
00:44:35,179 --> 00:44:37,179
J'suis revenu rien qu'd'un morceau, memere !

518
00:44:37,221 --> 00:44:38,762
Penses-tu qu'fa m'fait quelqu'chose ?

519
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,262
Vieille sorciere !

520
00:44:55,221 --> 00:44:57,096
It was over a year before I saw Dean again.

521
00:45:00,971 --> 00:45:05,846
I stayed home most of the time, struggling with a half- finished manuscript on my desk.

522
00:45:08,304 --> 00:45:09,929
Bored with all of it.

523
00:45:13,721 --> 00:45:19,560
RECORD SONG I used to love you But it's all over All over now.

524
00:45:21,929 --> 00:45:22,971
Sal's sister's house, North Carolina, December 1948.

525
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:27,179
Ma, on behalf of Nin and I, I just wanted to say that.

526
00:45:27,221 --> 00:45:32,846
"ton gateau est fantastique !"

527
00:45:32,887 --> 00:45:35,512
Thank you Hey, eh, eh.

528
00:45:35,554 --> 00:45:42,179
Listen to this General Douglas MacArthur bans kissing on the streets of Tokyo.

529
00:45:42,221 --> 00:45:45,179
Who does that puritanical old fart think he is?

530
00:45:45,221 --> 00:45:46,804
Sal.

531
00:45:56,512 --> 00:46:00,221
Ho, ho, ho Oh hello, merry, merry…

532
00:46:01,012 --> 00:46:02,929
Dean, I'll be goddamned !

533
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:03,679
You're early...

534
00:46:03,721 --> 00:46:04,471
Yeah, well...

535
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,012
Shit Who's in the car?

536
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:09,262
Oh, it's Marylou and my good pal Ed Dunkel.

537
00:46:09,262 --> 00:46:12,471
Anyways we need a place to clean up immediately.

538
00:46:12,471 --> 00:46:13,596
Man, we're dog tired.

539
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:14,471
Sure.

540
00:46:14,512 --> 00:46:15,637
How did you get here so fast?

541
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:16,929
That Hudson goes !

542
00:46:16,971 --> 00:46:18,096
Yeah?

543
00:46:18,137 --> 00:46:19,471
Where did you get it?

544
00:46:19,471 --> 00:46:21,471
I bought it out of my savings.

545
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:25,762
I was working as a breakman on the Southern Pacificmaking 400 bucks a month.

546
00:46:25,804 --> 00:46:26,929
And guess what?

547
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:29,679
I'm a father now !

548
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:31,429
What?

549
00:46:31,471 --> 00:46:32,971
You and Marylou?

550
00:46:32,971 --> 00:46:34,179
No, not Marylou.

551
00:46:34,179 --> 00:46:35,012
Camille !

552
00:46:35,054 --> 00:46:38,429
I annuled Marylou, hitched up with Camille, and now we have a sweet little Amy.

553
00:46:38,471 --> 00:46:40,971
And a nice little pad in 'Frisco.

554
00:46:41,012 --> 00:46:45,554
But as God as my witness, Marylou is the only honey- cunt I'll ever adore.

555
00:46:45,596 --> 00:46:48,387
That makes perfect sense.

556
00:46:52,012 --> 00:46:52,679
Dunkee !

557
00:46:54,137 --> 00:46:55,096
Dig this, Sal.

558
00:46:55,137 --> 00:46:58,262
Crazy Cat gets married and dumps his wife off in Tucson !

559
00:46:58,304 --> 00:47:00,221
Come in, come in.

560
00:47:02,846 --> 00:47:04,137
Holy shit.

561
00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:05,846
We really appreciate this, man.

562
00:47:05,846 --> 00:47:07,929
There's no heater in that California car.

563
00:47:07,971 --> 00:47:10,595
We haven't eaten in 30 hours.

564
00:47:10,637 --> 00:47:12,179
Or slept in a bed since...

565
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,137
Denver?

566
00:47:13,179 --> 00:47:14,512
We don't have a penny, one.

567
00:47:14,512 --> 00:47:16,304
Good times on the Dean Express, huh?

568
00:47:17,387 --> 00:47:19,512
Well, there's lots of food inside for everybody.

569
00:47:19,554 --> 00:47:20,512
Oh great, thanks.

570
00:47:22,054 --> 00:47:23,179
Look at all them books.

571
00:47:26,012 --> 00:47:26,595
Hi.

572
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:27,179
Hey.

573
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:30,054
How are you Marylou?

574
00:47:30,095 --> 00:47:31,429
I'm fine.

575
00:47:33,179 --> 00:47:35,595
But I gotta tell you how nice it is to see a sane face.

576
00:47:35,637 --> 00:47:40,179
Well, uh, sane is a very relative term around here, kid.

577
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:43,512
Don't call me that anymore, because that bastard aged me.

578
00:47:43,554 --> 00:47:45,720
Isn't that a great game to grab ass !

579
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:49,554
If you want food, it's on the left.

580
00:47:56,012 --> 00:47:56,804
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

581
00:47:59,054 --> 00:48:04,864
Ma, to repay your gregarious hospitalities and all the trimmings on this fine day of holiday giving,

582
00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:09,256
I will drive you and Sal up to old mad New York so you won't have to pay for a train.

583
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:13,054
How about that, Ma?

584
00:48:17,179 --> 00:48:18,179
Ok...

585
00:48:22,595 --> 00:48:23,304
S.
sorry.

586
00:48:36,429 --> 00:48:38,637
You don't know that feeling, man.

587
00:48:42,887 --> 00:48:44,304
I stole a .

588
00:48:44,345 --> 00:48:50,220
38 and I sat in the car, gun on my temple for 14 hours, Sal, trying to pull the trigger and I couldn't do.

589
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,095
And I'm sweating.

590
00:48:54,137 --> 00:48:56,262
And I'm nauseous.

591
00:48:56,304 --> 00:48:58,720
And Camille finds me this way, and I beg her to do it.

592
00:48:58,762 --> 00:49:00,470
To kill me.

593
00:49:01,887 --> 00:49:03,179
And she couldn't, man.

594
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,512
I don't know what's wrong with me.

595
00:49:09,554 --> 00:49:14,345
I do all these dumb things and I think in all these distorted ways, you know, I'm burning up.

596
00:49:20,429 --> 00:49:23,595
I'm scared I'm gonna lose all the wisdom I ever learned, Sal.

597
00:49:27,929 --> 00:49:35,345
You know, I see a girl and I just, ... you know, I just tremble all over and I get lost !

598
00:49:35,387 --> 00:49:38,054
Like a couple weeks ago.

599
00:49:38,095 --> 00:49:40,095
I meet this black boy, right?

600
00:49:40,137 --> 00:49:46,304
He's 25 and he's staying with his sugar mama, and we're digging some great music and we're getting high.

601
00:49:46,345 --> 00:49:48,554
And then I meet the greatest gone gal, Suzie, right.

602
00:49:48,595 --> 00:49:49,804
Oh, Suzie !

603
00:49:49,845 --> 00:49:52,262
And I swear she's a virgin.

604
00:49:52,304 --> 00:49:56,868
So I take her back to the black boy's place and 3 hours later she's getting a little drunk,

605
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:58,782
and the greatest show in the world starts, you know.

606
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:00,762
And she does this dance for us.

607
00:50:00,804 --> 00:50:05,641
She takes off her panties, she leaves on her dress, and she stands on her head and she does the splits,

608
00:50:05,642 --> 00:50:08,049
you know, and she's screaming the whole time "I want your cock !"

609
00:50:08,512 --> 00:50:10,179
right, "I need your cock !"

610
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:13,215
And she goes over next to the bed and she spreads the black boy's knees open

611
00:50:13,216 --> 00:50:17,382
and pulls out his big black beauty and starts chugging on that, going on that thing, really going at it.

612
00:50:17,887 --> 00:50:22,679
Spreads the black girl's knees open and starts going down on her big black hairy muff, you know.

613
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,095
Getson the bed and does a whole other miraculous splits, you know.

614
00:50:26,137 --> 00:50:28,429
Comes over to me, swallows me up.

615
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:30,804
Grabs the black boy's ears, pulls him down on her.

616
00:50:30,845 --> 00:50:34,554
Black girl grabs me and its a goddam four-way orgy, Sal.

617
00:50:34,595 --> 00:50:36,887
Goes on for four fucking hours.

618
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:44,053
God And I missed this?

619
00:50:46,137 --> 00:50:47,053
Yeah.

620
00:50:53,595 --> 00:50:54,470
Yeah.

621
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,053
It's good to have family, isn't it?

622
00:51:41,553 --> 00:51:42,762
Goddammit !

623
00:51:42,762 --> 00:51:46,276
You see, one day that little kid's gonna throw a rock through a guy's fucking windshield

624
00:51:46,277 --> 00:51:48,995
and he's going to crash and die all on account of that little piss-pants?

625
00:51:49,928 --> 00:51:50,678
See what I mean?

626
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,345
God exists without qualms.

627
00:52:05,012 --> 00:52:05,970
South Hill, Virginia.

628
00:52:08,928 --> 00:52:11,553
<i>Coming up next Mike Sullivan covers the weather for your......</i>

629
00:52:17,387 --> 00:52:18,928
<i>going to be up for some low...</i>

630
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:25,512
Stop.

631
00:52:34,512 --> 00:52:35,387
Que c'est qu'il fait ?

632
00:52:36,637 --> 00:52:37,303
Hein ?

633
00:52:37,345 --> 00:52:39,012
Comme dit le President Truman .

634
00:52:39,095 --> 00:52:41,637
"We have to cut down on the cost of living."

635
00:52:52,137 --> 00:52:53,678
Whooooaooo !

636
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:58,220
Man, oh, man, we must absolutely findsome time for kicks in New York !

637
00:52:59,928 --> 00:53:01,387
Carlo's back from Africa.

638
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:04,637
We all get to see Carlo first thing in the morning, darlings.

639
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:21,678
Lady, you shouldn't let your son drive that fast in these conditions.

640
00:53:23,095 --> 00:53:25,178
You're in my state, you slow down.

641
00:53:29,803 --> 00:53:31,262
I'll pay you back every cent, Ma.

642
00:53:31,303 --> 00:53:34,470
Oh, you're fucked now, Dean.

643
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:47,137
But all I'm saying in the sincerities of my soul is that I miss you, darling, and I'll be right back in those arms.

644
00:53:47,178 --> 00:53:49,512
(over the phone) Look, I got your postcard from Denver.

645
00:53:49,553 --> 00:53:50,928
Do you think I'm an idiot?

646
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:52,303
I know Denver means Marylou.

647
00:53:52,345 --> 00:53:53,678
Marylou who?

648
00:53:55,887 --> 00:53:57,012
Come on, Sweet Cakes.

649
00:53:57,053 --> 00:53:58,803
You know there are certainties our minds can grasp.

650
00:53:58,845 --> 00:54:00,345
(over the phone) Oh shut up!

651
00:54:00,387 --> 00:54:01,595
I never want you back!

652
00:54:01,637 --> 00:54:02,762
Don't you dare come back here!

653
00:54:02,803 --> 00:54:03,845
Ever!

654
00:54:23,428 --> 00:54:30,095
This is the new and complete Dean, grown to his own definition of maturity.

655
00:54:30,136 --> 00:54:34,261
I say to myself, "My God, he's changed!

656
00:54:34,261 --> 00:54:37,845
" Fury spits out of his eyes when he tells of things he hates.

657
00:54:37,886 --> 00:54:41,470
Great glows of joy replace this when suddenly he gets happy.

658
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:44,553
Every muscle lives to twitch and go.

659
00:54:46,261 --> 00:54:46,845
Sal

660
00:54:51,553 --> 00:54:52,220
Yeah?

661
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,428
Phone for you.

662
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:54,178
Thanks.

663
00:54:56,595 --> 00:54:57,220
Hello?

664
00:54:57,261 --> 00:54:59,011
(over the phone)Sal Paradise?

665
00:54:59,053 --> 00:55:01,011
Bull calling you from New Orleans.

666
00:55:01,011 --> 00:55:02,011
Bull Lee?

667
00:55:02,053 --> 00:55:02,845
How the hell are you?

668
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:07,511
Well, we have ourselves a situation that needs immediate rectifying.

669
00:55:07,511 --> 00:55:11,053
I've got a girl down here just showed up on my doorstep.

670
00:55:11,053 --> 00:55:18,345
This Galatea Dunkel is looking for some clown named Ed Dunkel, and I don't know who the hell these people are.

671
00:55:18,428 --> 00:55:21,678
Uh, Galatea and Ed are friends of Dean's from Denver.

672
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,595
Oh, shit Dean ...

673
00:55:26,053 --> 00:55:28,511
Well, she wants to talk to you.

674
00:55:28,553 --> 00:55:30,636
Make it fast, would you?

675
00:55:30,678 --> 00:55:33,595
The telephone cartels don't do this for free.

676
00:55:37,553 --> 00:55:39,011
Hello, its Galatea.

677
00:55:39,011 --> 00:55:40,470
Is Ed there?

678
00:55:40,511 --> 00:55:43,511
Uh, Ed's fine, but he's sleeping.

679
00:55:43,511 --> 00:55:46,720
Well, would you please tell him to come and get me.

680
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:51,511
Mr. Lee and his wife don't seem all that happy to have me around.

681
00:55:51,553 --> 00:55:55,553
And I should kill Ed for what he did to me, dumping me here like this !

682
00:55:55,595 --> 00:55:59,261
And he's simply got to come and get me as soon as he can !

683
00:55:59,303 --> 00:56:04,053
He's got to help me, these people are mad They're mad!

684
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:06,053
Well, we'll be there right after New Years.

685
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:16,095
Thank you.

686
00:56:16,136 --> 00:56:17,553
Mmm hmm.

687
00:56:20,595 --> 00:56:21,428
(singing) Dynamite!

688
00:56:26,303 --> 00:56:27,095
Look at that !

689
00:56:27,095 --> 00:56:28,303
Oh my !

690
00:56:53,261 --> 00:56:54,470
I'm telling you, she's cross-eyed.

691
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:55,553
She's not looking at you, it's me.

692
00:56:55,595 --> 00:57:01,970
I was twenty days at sea in the doldrums, uh, when I decided to kill myself.

693
00:57:02,011 --> 00:57:06,220
And I realized that shit, I haven't written a fucking suicide note !

694
00:57:06,261 --> 00:57:09,513
I'm going over, you know, searching my mind for the right words,

695
00:57:09,514 --> 00:57:13,651
and then I saw all of the crew coming out onto the deck,

696
00:57:13,652 --> 00:57:15,337
and I couldn't jump anymore.

697
00:57:15,761 --> 00:57:20,178
But, in that moment, I resolved to follow my heart.

698
00:57:20,178 --> 00:57:21,845
To live.

699
00:57:21,886 --> 00:57:22,803
Yeah.

700
00:57:22,845 --> 00:57:24,970
To experience the wisdom of life,

701
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:25,511
Yes.

702
00:57:25,553 --> 00:57:30,928
mad with ecstasy and vengeance and truth.

703
00:57:30,928 --> 00:57:35,303
I'm glad I did, because otherwise I would have missed out on this amazing pot.

704
00:57:37,011 --> 00:57:37,761
So !

705
00:57:37,803 --> 00:57:43,636
On that, on that note, everybody move their feet like you feel something, like you're alive !

706
00:57:44,553 --> 00:57:45,469
Like we're alive !

707
00:57:45,511 --> 00:57:52,844
And on that, I want us to raise our glasses, being alive, (Yeah ) to living, and to life.

708
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:56,428
and others To life(All cheer)

709
00:57:57,386 --> 00:57:58,969
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

710
00:57:59,011 --> 00:58:01,886
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

711
00:58:03,636 --> 00:58:05,136
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

712
00:58:06,886 --> 00:58:08,428
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

713
00:58:16,469 --> 00:58:17,928
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

714
00:58:22,761 --> 00:58:24,303
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

715
00:58:24,344 --> 00:58:27,344
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

716
00:58:31,678 --> 00:58:34,053
Where do you find such absolutely wonderful people?

717
00:58:34,053 --> 00:58:35,886
I've never seen anyone like that.

718
00:58:47,678 --> 00:58:49,094
She's the real mad one !

719
00:59:19,303 --> 00:59:20,261
with Seven !

720
00:59:20,303 --> 00:59:21,011
Six !

721
00:59:21,053 --> 00:59:21,969
Five !

722
00:59:22,011 --> 00:59:22,761
Four !

723
00:59:22,803 --> 00:59:23,511
Three !

724
00:59:23,553 --> 00:59:24,261
Two !

725
00:59:24,303 --> 00:59:25,136
One !

726
00:59:25,511 --> 00:59:27,219
Happy New Year(cheers)

727
00:59:28,803 --> 00:59:30,844
1949 !

728
00:59:30,886 --> 00:59:32,636
Happy New Year !

729
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:34,469
Love you as ever, Sal.

730
00:59:34,511 --> 00:59:35,386
Whatever man.

731
00:59:35,386 --> 00:59:36,011
Love you.

732
00:59:36,011 --> 00:59:36,428
Love you.

733
00:59:36,428 --> 00:59:37,553
What have you got?

734
00:59:52,428 --> 00:59:53,303
Hell of a night !

735
00:59:53,344 --> 00:59:55,011
Happy New Year ...

736
00:59:58,053 --> 00:59:58,678
I love you...

737
01:00:02,261 --> 01:00:05,386
Sal, I have something to ask of you, very important.

738
01:00:05,428 --> 01:00:06,344
Uh-uh.

739
01:00:06,386 --> 01:00:08,011
I wonder how you'll take it.

740
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:10,928
We're buddies, aren't we?

741
01:00:13,886 --> 01:00:14,594
Yeah?...

742
01:00:16,344 --> 01:00:17,428
Carlo's apartment, Harlem.

743
01:00:25,886 --> 01:00:27,761
Sal said yes, my darling.

744
01:00:30,428 --> 01:00:31,678
Sal, that's great.

745
01:00:35,011 --> 01:00:36,719
Well, hop in, the water's fine.

746
01:00:44,219 --> 01:00:44,803
What?

747
01:01:28,261 --> 01:01:30,136
Fuck, I can't do this !

748
01:01:30,177 --> 01:01:30,969
Come on, man.

749
01:01:31,011 --> 01:01:32,094
You promised.

750
01:01:32,136 --> 01:01:34,052
Do you really want to do this, Marylou?

751
01:01:35,844 --> 01:01:37,344
She thinks it's swell.

752
01:01:51,552 --> 01:01:52,344
What?

753
01:01:52,386 --> 01:01:55,552
Now, come on now, we have to just all goddam relax !

754
01:01:57,261 --> 01:01:57,802
Dean.

755
01:01:57,844 --> 01:02:00,511
Can you go wait in the kitchen?

756
01:02:00,552 --> 01:02:03,177
Like now, please?

757
01:02:14,552 --> 01:02:16,802
Honey, he just wants to see what it would be like.

758
01:02:18,677 --> 01:02:21,969
I told him that I wouldn't do that with any guy (whispers) but you.

759
01:02:30,886 --> 01:02:32,719
Well, you can still change your mind.

760
01:03:03,761 --> 01:03:04,677
(Sound of Marylou and Dean having sex)Very good.

761
01:03:19,969 --> 01:03:21,427
(off) Gee.

762
01:03:21,469 --> 01:03:22,052
Write that down.

763
01:03:22,094 --> 01:03:23,177
I got it.

764
01:03:27,344 --> 01:03:30,344
So Ed, why did you abandon Galatea in Tucson?

765
01:03:30,386 --> 01:03:31,844
She's your wife.

766
01:03:33,802 --> 01:03:36,511
What are you doing wandering around the country like this?

767
01:03:36,552 --> 01:03:41,594
Dean, why did you leave Camille and pick up Marylou?

768
01:03:41,636 --> 01:03:43,719
What are your womanly intentions?

769
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:49,052
And, what is this mad obsession you have with him?

770
01:03:51,802 --> 01:03:54,177
(laughs)What is this mad obsession you have with him?

771
01:03:56,302 --> 01:03:57,219
Touche !

772
01:03:59,386 --> 01:04:01,344
Days of wrath are coming my friends.

773
01:04:03,302 --> 01:04:04,594
This high you're on is a mirage.

774
01:04:04,636 --> 01:04:10,344
You're all going to go flying off to the West Coast and come crashing down to earth.

775
01:04:11,469 --> 01:04:12,552
Like this, Carlo?

776
01:04:14,969 --> 01:04:16,052
Yeah, Dean.

777
01:04:18,052 --> 01:04:19,302
Exactly like that.

778
01:04:19,344 --> 01:04:21,177
Alrighty, who's hungry?

779
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:40,302
We were leaving confusion and nonsense behind, and performing our one noble function of the time move.

780
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:45,260
New Orleans and ol'Bull Lee.

781
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:46,469
Then West.

782
01:04:46,469 --> 01:04:50,344
It would take all night to talk about ol' Bull Lee.

783
01:04:51,677 --> 01:04:53,594
Let's just say now he was a teacher.

784
01:04:53,635 --> 01:04:57,302
And he had every right to teach, 'cuz he spent all his time learning.

785
01:05:16,427 --> 01:05:17,219
Now listen darling.

786
01:05:19,427 --> 01:05:23,552
You know that I'm capable of everything at the same time, and I have unlimited energy.

787
01:05:25,135 --> 01:05:29,552
So now when we get back to San Francisco we must absolutely go on living together.

788
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:33,802
I know just the place for you to live.

789
01:05:33,802 --> 01:05:38,760
I'll be home every night and be at Camille's by the morning.

790
01:05:38,802 --> 01:05:41,844
We've done it before, see, she'll never know.

791
01:05:52,552 --> 01:05:57,177
<i>Communism subjects the individual to arrest without lawful cause.</i>

792
01:05:57,177 --> 01:06:02,594
<i>It decrees what information he shall receive, what art he shall produce.</i>

793
01:06:02,635 --> 01:06:05,344
<i>Democracy is based on the conviction that man has the moral...</i>

794
01:06:06,969 --> 01:06:07,719
Shit.

795
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:08,802
Ed, slow down.

796
01:06:09,969 --> 01:06:10,802
Underpants.

797
01:06:25,302 --> 01:06:29,427
Do you guys think you can rush through here as fast as you want 'cuz you're from California?

798
01:06:30,469 --> 01:06:32,927
Don't worry officer, we're heading back to California.

799
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,552
I need everybody to step out of that car, please.

800
01:06:44,594 --> 01:06:45,552
How old are you, young lady?

801
01:06:45,552 --> 01:06:47,594
I'm eighteen.

802
01:06:47,635 --> 01:06:49,885
Who's that guy you're with?

803
01:06:49,927 --> 01:06:51,385
My husband.

804
01:06:51,385 --> 01:06:55,385
I've got the certificate right in the back if you want to see it.

805
01:06:57,844 --> 01:07:00,302
Who you all in such a hurry to see out there in California?

806
01:07:02,052 --> 01:07:03,010
My wife.

807
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:06,552
Your wife?

808
01:07:06,594 --> 01:07:09,844
This one here just said she's your wife.

809
01:07:09,927 --> 01:07:12,302
She's my ex-wife.

810
01:07:12,344 --> 01:07:15,885
What the hell you doing with your ex-wife?

811
01:07:15,927 --> 01:07:17,260
You're going out to see your wife !

812
01:07:17,302 --> 01:07:18,135
That's not important.

813
01:07:18,177 --> 01:07:18,677
Hey boy !

814
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:21,802
You gonna waltz in here and tell me what's important?

815
01:07:34,344 --> 01:07:37,135
It's gonna be 25 dollars for speeding.

816
01:07:37,177 --> 01:07:38,094
Or what?

817
01:07:38,094 --> 01:07:43,344
Or I can run you in right now and slap a special California-boy charge on your ass.

818
01:07:43,344 --> 01:07:44,135
Yeah?

819
01:07:44,177 --> 01:07:44,969
What charge?

820
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:46,510
Don't you worry about it, wise guy.

821
01:07:58,844 --> 01:08:00,552
That guy's got it so goddam easy !

822
01:08:00,594 --> 01:08:02,510
They'll out and shoot you if you complain, too.

823
01:08:02,552 --> 01:08:04,344
I wish I had a fucking gun !

824
01:08:05,844 --> 01:08:07,718
Dunkel, you are not driving anymore.

825
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,468
Marylou, spread those knees and lets smoke some weed.

826
01:08:36,843 --> 01:08:37,677
It was my father's.

827
01:08:41,052 --> 01:08:41,885
It works.

828
01:08:51,718 --> 01:08:52,635
Thanks a lot.

829
01:09:02,802 --> 01:09:03,885
Flomaton, Alabama

830
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:07,677
<i>Don't know...</i>

831
01:09:07,718 --> 01:09:09,372
<i>When it comes to buying a gift or it comes to buy a present, </i>

832
01:09:09,373 --> 01:09:11,865
<i>I never have to wonder, I never have to thunder.</i>

833
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:15,625
<i>If it's a wedding present, if it's an engagement present, if its a shower,</i>

834
01:09:15,626 --> 01:09:19,391
<i> it it's a husband who wants to buy his wife something, I know exactly what to say...</i>

835
01:09:20,135 --> 01:09:21,218
<i>I go to...</i>

836
01:09:22,302 --> 01:09:24,427
Like President Truman says.

837
01:09:24,427 --> 01:09:27,135
"You have to cut down on the cost of living."

838
01:09:27,135 --> 01:09:29,427
Yes, yes we do.

839
01:09:48,968 --> 01:09:51,635
I'm telling you it's true Sal, I started at 9.

840
01:09:52,718 --> 01:09:54,135
With a girl named Millie Mayfair !

841
01:09:54,177 --> 01:09:57,260
That's when my old man was barbering a bit still.

842
01:09:57,302 --> 01:10:02,760
Oh honey Marylou, if only I'd known you then, how sweet you must have been at 9 !

843
01:10:04,177 --> 01:10:05,843
Hey, here's another one for you Sal.

844
01:10:05,927 --> 01:10:09,010
One time I jumped a freight from New Mexico clear to LA.

845
01:10:09,093 --> 01:10:09,968
And I was 11.

846
01:10:09,968 --> 01:10:15,427
I lost my father along the side, and we were staying in a hobo jungle and I hadn't seen him for months.

847
01:10:15,468 --> 01:10:20,454
So, by the time I get to LA I'm so starved for milk that I get a job right in the dairy

848
01:10:20,455 --> 01:10:23,989
and straight off drink 2 quarts of heavy cream and just puke

849
01:10:27,385 --> 01:10:29,093
Poor, tragic Dean

850
01:11:02,427 --> 01:11:05,593
So Dunkel, I suppose you're happy to get back to your wife.

851
01:11:22,677 --> 01:11:23,510
Algiers, Louisiana

852
01:11:38,885 --> 01:11:39,676
Bull?

853
01:11:42,843 --> 01:11:43,510
Jane?

854
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:47,760
Hello?

855
01:12:06,885 --> 01:12:07,468
Bull?

856
01:12:16,301 --> 01:12:16,968
Bull?

857
01:12:22,718 --> 01:12:23,260
Bull?

858
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:33,343
That sounds like the angel Sal Paradise.

859
01:12:35,176 --> 01:12:35,968
How are you?

860
01:12:40,635 --> 01:12:41,385
Fair.

861
01:12:51,468 --> 01:12:52,135
Hi Jane !

862
01:12:54,093 --> 01:12:55,760
We finally brought Ed Dunkel with us.

863
01:12:58,260 --> 01:12:59,343
Is Galatea home?

864
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:02,468
Excuse me.

865
01:13:04,593 --> 01:13:05,635
Lizards.

866
01:13:25,843 --> 01:13:26,510
Ed?

867
01:13:28,801 --> 01:13:29,801
Hi, Galatea

868
01:13:31,676 --> 01:13:33,343
Get out of my sight !

869
01:13:34,093 --> 01:13:35,051
You're an animal !

870
01:13:35,093 --> 01:13:37,885
I guess I'll go help the missus sweep the tree.

871
01:13:37,926 --> 01:13:39,801
Ass !

872
01:13:42,218 --> 01:13:43,301
You're Sal, right?

873
01:13:43,343 --> 01:13:45,468
It depends.

874
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:47,301
Do you know what these bastards did to me?

875
01:13:47,343 --> 01:13:51,426
Dean leaves his wife and baby penniless because he wants to visit you.

876
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:54,760
And Ed, being a sheep wants to tag along.

877
01:13:54,801 --> 01:13:56,385
Only they have no money !

878
01:13:56,426 --> 01:14:00,551
So Ed asks me for the money, and I say, "I'm not giving you any unless we're married."

879
01:14:00,593 --> 01:14:03,926
And Dean says, "Hey, Ed, stupid ass.

880
01:14:03,968 --> 01:14:05,176
Marry the broad !

881
01:14:05,218 --> 01:14:06,385
"No, I do love you too, honey...

882
01:14:06,385 --> 01:14:06,885
Shut up !

883
01:14:07,218 --> 01:14:08,801
So he marries me for gas fare !

884
01:14:08,843 --> 01:14:11,847
And we get in the car, and Dean drives like Satan,

885
01:14:11,848 --> 01:14:14,198
smoking marijuana the whole way,

886
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:16,526
and they won't even let me stop to use the ladies room.

887
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:22,218
And when I say something about it, they dump me in Tucson. In Tucson!

888
01:14:24,093 --> 01:14:25,176
Come on, Galatea.

889
01:14:25,218 --> 01:14:26,510
I mean.

890
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:28,926
Dean will be dead some day and then what can you say to him?

891
01:14:28,926 --> 01:14:30,301
The sooner he's dead, the better.

892
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:35,885
Where were you going?

893
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:38,301
Can't I watch you guys screw?

894
01:14:40,718 --> 01:14:42,301
Honey, I'm sorry.

895
01:14:42,301 --> 01:14:43,968
A week, a couple of weeks.

896
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:44,510
I just thought...

897
01:14:44,551 --> 01:14:45,385
You just thought what?

898
01:14:45,426 --> 01:14:47,718
You could just leave me here in this house with strangers?

899
01:15:05,218 --> 01:15:08,219
"Old woman, old woman, old woman, quoth I, "

900
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:10,659
"Oh whither, oh whither, oh whither so high "

901
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:14,624
"To brush the cobwebs off the sky"

902
01:15:15,539 --> 01:15:17,152
"Shall I go with thee?"

903
01:15:19,593 --> 01:15:20,884
I would go with her.

904
01:15:20,884 --> 01:15:25,336
We could go together, and we could brush the cobwebs from the sky.

905
01:15:25,926 --> 01:15:28,176
"By and by, by and by."

906
01:15:28,218 --> 01:15:31,009
What the hell has he ever done to anyone?

907
01:15:31,009 --> 01:15:33,926
Well, he drove my mother halfway across the country.

908
01:15:33,968 --> 01:15:34,968
Did he?

909
01:15:35,009 --> 01:15:35,801
Yeah.

910
01:15:37,051 --> 01:15:37,968
Nah...

911
01:15:39,384 --> 01:15:42,968
Dean does not feel responsibility towards others.

912
01:15:43,009 --> 01:15:44,843
He does not know the concept.

913
01:15:46,161 --> 01:15:51,009
Then again, he feels others have some mysterious obligation to support him.

914
01:15:51,884 --> 01:15:53,134
No, I'm OK, Bull.

915
01:15:54,051 --> 01:15:56,551
I find it unspeakably distasteful.

916
01:15:56,593 --> 01:15:59,801
But Dean gives everyone a damn good time just being himself

917
01:15:59,801 --> 01:16:01,759
He gives illusions.

918
01:16:01,801 --> 01:16:02,759
Tricks.

919
01:16:02,801 --> 01:16:07,301
Maybe that's because you're not seeing what's really holy about Dean.

920
01:16:07,343 --> 01:16:10,009
So he's a holy man now !

921
01:16:10,051 --> 01:16:12,843
A religious figure in your eyes !

922
01:16:12,884 --> 01:16:14,468
Argh, Paradise ...

923
01:16:14,468 --> 01:16:17,301
Aren't you a pretty little bird?...

924
01:16:17,343 --> 01:16:20,093
What I see in him is compulsive psychosis.

925
01:16:20,134 --> 01:16:24,676
Dashed with a jigger of psychopathic irresponsibility and violence.

926
01:16:31,468 --> 01:16:35,801
Well, young man, I do believe the cocktail hour is upon us.

927
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:42,926
Now this nation is dead in its soul and we do nothing.

928
01:16:42,968 --> 01:16:46,551
All we do is wait, for the end to come.

929
01:16:48,176 --> 01:16:48,676
See?

930
01:16:48,718 --> 01:16:49,301
She knows.

931
01:16:49,343 --> 01:16:51,676
The female always knows.

932
01:16:51,718 --> 01:16:55,259
And the end of the world will start here, too.

933
01:16:55,343 --> 01:16:57,051
In Texas.

934
01:16:57,843 --> 01:16:58,718
Louisiana.

935
01:17:00,426 --> 01:17:02,968
Louisiana and Texas.

936
01:17:04,968 --> 01:17:07,093
This is an outstanding martini.

937
01:17:07,134 --> 01:17:09,176
Yes.

938
01:17:09,176 --> 01:17:11,093
May I?

939
01:17:11,134 --> 01:17:12,551
Please.

940
01:17:12,551 --> 01:17:13,301
MmmMmm.

941
01:17:18,718 --> 01:17:20,676
That is an outstanding martini.

942
01:17:26,509 --> 01:17:31,968
You know that a bat, when they suck the blood out of things squirrels, and...

943
01:17:32,009 --> 01:17:33,343
Dad, draw a face.

944
01:17:33,384 --> 01:17:34,926
Dad draw a face.

945
01:17:34,968 --> 01:17:42,843
They got teeth, long teeth, that's what they stick in the squirrels and then they suck the blood out of them.

946
01:17:42,884 --> 01:17:45,009
What's their names?

947
01:17:45,009 --> 01:17:50,259
I think, uh, Lorraine is a good name for a bat.

948
01:17:50,301 --> 01:17:52,009
That's Lorraine

949
01:17:52,009 --> 01:17:57,134
I need some wings on it like that, ain't that right, you little beast?

950
01:17:57,176 --> 01:17:58,435
Here the toes.

951
01:17:59,491 --> 01:18:01,964
I'm gonna sell it for a lot of money.

952
01:18:01,965 --> 01:18:02,965
Money...

953
01:18:35,926 --> 01:18:38,467
Translation is indeed treason.

954
01:18:38,509 --> 01:18:39,967
I got him.

955
01:18:40,009 --> 01:18:41,842
In English you got him saying "fingers rummaging...

956
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:42,717
person...

957
01:18:42,759 --> 01:18:43,717
in his pockets".

958
01:18:43,759 --> 01:18:46,134
Celine did not write that.

959
01:18:46,176 --> 01:18:50,509
He wrote, "Hands in assholes and pockets."

960
01:18:50,509 --> 01:18:51,634
Uh.

961
01:18:54,717 --> 01:19:01,342
Well, um, if you could push it away from here.

962
01:19:01,384 --> 01:19:03,759
Away, um, the crumbs.

963
01:19:03,801 --> 01:19:07,217
So, how's it been with Ed?

964
01:19:07,259 --> 01:19:10,051
I don't know how to do it.

965
01:19:11,301 --> 01:19:13,009
How to make him happy.

966
01:19:15,092 --> 01:19:17,676
Oh, it's simple really, honey, all you have to do is...

967
01:19:24,509 --> 01:19:25,342
Okay, I'm.

968
01:19:25,342 --> 01:19:28,801
Here is you, here's him, right here.

969
01:19:28,842 --> 01:19:30,509
palm of your hand.

970
01:19:30,551 --> 01:19:34,426
I mean, with mouth, but he'll be in the palm of your hand.

971
01:19:34,467 --> 01:19:36,342
Boys always love that.

972
01:19:36,342 --> 01:19:38,551
You'll love it too, I promise.

973
01:19:42,009 --> 01:19:42,926
Merci

974
01:19:44,926 --> 01:19:53,217
Now, something can and should be done to eliminate the black seed of noxious effluviants gestating in our unsuspecting gut.

975
01:19:53,259 --> 01:19:57,092
I give you the orgone accumulator !

976
01:19:57,092 --> 01:20:01,926
Captures the vibratory atmospheric atoms of the life principal.

977
01:20:01,967 --> 01:20:05,967
Folks get cancer 'cuz they run out of orgone.

978
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:07,301
Come on !

979
01:20:07,342 --> 01:20:08,926
You gotta try it with me.

980
01:20:08,967 --> 01:20:11,384
It'll put some juice in your bones, I'm telling you.

981
01:20:11,426 --> 01:20:17,092
I always rush up and take off 90 miles to the nearest whore house !

982
01:20:19,384 --> 01:20:23,592
All right, oh hey, look at that, see how big he got?

983
01:20:23,676 --> 01:20:27,676
See that, not an inch of cancer !

984
01:20:31,509 --> 01:20:32,426
Let's crank her up.

985
01:20:34,759 --> 01:20:37,009
And don't let the cocksuckers get you down

986
01:20:37,009 --> 01:20:38,717
Looks like a fucking closet

987
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:49,009
The purity of the road.

988
01:20:51,051 --> 01:20:57,676
The white line in the middle of the highway unrolled, and hugged our left front tire as if glued to our groove.

989
01:20:57,717 --> 01:21:00,092
Dunkel, Dunkle, who's gonna shepherd you now?

990
01:21:00,134 --> 01:21:02,467
Here are a couple bucks for you.

991
01:21:02,467 --> 01:21:04,259
You know you don't have to do that, Bull.

992
01:21:04,301 --> 01:21:06,009
It's alright, it's only money.

993
01:21:06,051 --> 01:21:07,259
Thanks.

994
01:21:07,301 --> 01:21:08,467
Don't forget to write !

995
01:21:08,509 --> 01:21:09,551
I won't.

996
01:21:09,592 --> 01:21:10,676
Bye, brother.

997
01:21:12,342 --> 01:21:14,342
Dean, you keep her out of the ditch !

998
01:21:24,217 --> 01:21:25,759
And zoom went the car!

999
01:21:25,801 --> 01:21:27,717
And we were off again - for California.

1000
01:21:56,926 --> 01:21:58,676
Hey, listen to this one, Sal.

1001
01:22:00,176 --> 01:22:02,676
"'Not caring for their lives' is it?

1002
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:05,408
Why, what in the world is there that we should care

1003
01:22:05,409 --> 01:22:10,399
for if it is not our lives, the only gift the Lord never offers us a second time."

1004
01:22:16,217 --> 01:22:17,634
What do you think about that one, Sal?

1005
01:22:18,675 --> 01:22:19,550
Welcome.

1006
01:22:19,967 --> 01:22:20,509
I'll be right with you.

1007
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:20,925
Thanks.

1008
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:44,050
Willcox, Arizona

1009
01:23:08,467 --> 01:23:10,259
Can't you wait 'til we're in Frisco?

1010
01:23:13,634 --> 01:23:14,634
I don't care.

1011
01:23:14,634 --> 01:23:16,800
Dean's gonna leave me anyway.

1012
01:23:19,884 --> 01:23:21,217
When are you going to go back to Denver?

1013
01:23:24,009 --> 01:23:24,759
I don't know.

1014
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,842
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1015
01:23:26,884 --> 01:23:29,009
I could go back to my fiance.

1016
01:23:31,425 --> 01:23:32,342
Fiance?

1017
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:34,800
He's a sailor.

1018
01:23:34,842 --> 01:23:37,134
He's been away awhile.

1019
01:23:37,175 --> 01:23:38,009
He's.

1020
01:23:38,050 --> 01:23:38,634
he's nice.

1021
01:23:38,675 --> 01:23:40,009
That's good.

1022
01:23:44,425 --> 01:23:46,592
I wish Dean wasn't so crazy now.

1023
01:23:46,634 --> 01:23:48,592
You could be wishing that the rest of your life !

1024
01:23:51,384 --> 01:23:52,550
I just want a house.

1025
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:53,967
A baby.

1026
01:23:56,009 --> 01:23:57,384
You know, something normal.

1027
01:23:57,425 --> 01:23:59,092
I really do want that.

1028
01:24:09,967 --> 01:24:13,925
I just had a great idea, you guys are gonna love it.

1029
01:24:13,967 --> 01:24:17,134
Is everybody absolutely comfortable?

1030
01:24:29,384 --> 01:24:30,384
You alright Sal?

1031
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:32,717
(Yeah.

1032
01:24:58,717 --> 01:25:03,850
"For it always happened when I woke like this and my mind struggled in an unsuccessful attempt

1033
01:25:03,851 --> 01:25:10,618
to discover where I was, everything would be moving around me through the darkness, things, places, years.

1034
01:25:11,175 --> 01:25:14,842
My body still too heavy with sleep to move."

1035
01:25:36,258 --> 01:25:37,592
How much money you got, kid?

1036
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:38,758
Nothing.

1037
01:25:38,758 --> 01:25:41,258
But I got an aunt in Tulare, California.

1038
01:25:41,342 --> 01:25:45,008
She owns a grocery store and as soon as we get there, I'll have money for you all.

1039
01:25:45,008 --> 01:25:52,425
Yes, yes, we all got aunts, well let's go jump in back, let's see the aunts and uncles and grocery stores all away across the road to get our kicks.

1040
01:25:54,758 --> 01:25:55,383
I'm Alfred.

1041
01:25:55,383 --> 01:25:56,092
Sal.

1042
01:25:56,092 --> 01:25:56,800
Hi.

1043
01:25:56,842 --> 01:25:57,467
Marylou.

1044
01:25:57,508 --> 01:25:58,133
Hi.

1045
01:25:58,175 --> 01:25:58,592
Alfred.

1046
01:26:02,467 --> 01:26:08,758
Hot damn, I left Bakersfield in a travel bureau car, left my guitar in the trunk of another one.

1047
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,050
It never showed up.

1048
01:26:11,258 --> 01:26:12,842
Guitars and cowboy duds.

1049
01:26:12,883 --> 01:26:14,300
How much you got?

1050
01:26:14,342 --> 01:26:15,800
How much you want?

1051
01:26:30,008 --> 01:26:34,258
I knew a man, he forgave his wife for shooting him and got her out of jail.

1052
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:38,133
Only, she shoots him a second time !

1053
01:26:41,133 --> 01:26:42,217
That's a good one

1054
01:26:42,883 --> 01:26:44,967
Hold on to your girdles

1055
01:26:48,592 --> 01:26:50,133
Baby !

1056
01:27:00,258 --> 01:27:02,633
Yes, yes, yes

1057
01:27:33,592 --> 01:27:39,194
(singing) Had my finger on the trigger so long

1058
01:27:40,114 --> 01:27:44,289
Seems like I'd shoot again by now

1059
01:27:45,333 --> 01:27:51,053
So hard when you can't stand the sound

1060
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:59,187
I gathered your remains, cleaned up the stains

1061
01:27:59,188 --> 01:28:03,977
I took care for we once were friends

1062
01:28:05,321 --> 01:28:10,864
But it's hard when you're burning in a hell

1063
01:28:13,178 --> 01:28:20,017
And it's hard enough to be in love

1064
01:28:21,177 --> 01:28:28,947
And it's hard, ain't it hard, to love what you kill

1065
01:28:46,467 --> 01:28:47,425
San Francisco, California

1066
01:29:24,227 --> 01:29:24,703
(low) Alright.

1067
01:29:29,336 --> 01:29:30,055
Go, hurry !

1068
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:34,725
Really, you better make it to Camille's in time for dinner so she can feed your lazy ass !

1069
01:29:40,475 --> 01:29:42,016
Do you see what a bastard he is?

1070
01:30:11,141 --> 01:30:12,558
By the end of the week, darling.

1071
01:30:16,683 --> 01:30:17,391
Thank you.

1072
01:30:17,433 --> 01:30:19,308
Thank you.

1073
01:32:32,016 --> 01:32:33,308
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop !

1074
01:32:53,391 --> 01:32:57,641
Darling Sal, I'm going back to Denver, to my fiance the sailor.

1075
01:32:57,683 --> 01:32:59,933
No more road for me.

1076
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:03,099
Thanks for an amazing night, my sweet lover.

1077
01:33:03,141 --> 01:33:06,849
Why don'tyou kick Dean in the ass if you ever see him again.

1078
01:33:06,891 --> 01:33:08,599
I love you.

1079
01:33:08,641 --> 01:33:10,474
P.S.

1080
01:33:10,891 --> 01:33:12,058
Good luck with your book.

1081
01:34:54,308 --> 01:34:55,558
What the hell you looking at?

1082
01:35:04,641 --> 01:35:07,058
Campbell, California

1083
01:35:47,338 --> 01:35:47,878
Yoshi.

1084
01:35:51,343 --> 01:35:52,204
Brada.

1085
01:35:56,224 --> 01:35:56,933
Rodriguez.

1086
01:35:59,972 --> 01:36:00,721
Luigi.

1087
01:37:08,614 --> 01:37:12,141
Sal.. Shit, no. Oh oh oh

1088
01:37:14,891 --> 01:37:16,057
How the hell are you, man?

1089
01:37:16,099 --> 01:37:18,057
Better than you, my boy.

1090
01:37:18,057 --> 01:37:19,557
Have you eaten these last few months?

1091
01:37:19,599 --> 01:37:21,474
Not as much as you, fat ass !

1092
01:37:26,714 --> 01:37:28,349
Family man, huh?

1093
01:37:28,391 --> 01:37:29,307
Yeah.

1094
01:37:31,516 --> 01:37:32,349
How's Camille?

1095
01:37:32,391 --> 01:37:34,141
She's good, she's just resting.

1096
01:37:35,516 --> 01:37:36,307
Where's the Hudson?

1097
01:37:36,349 --> 01:37:38,016
Yeah.

1098
01:37:38,057 --> 01:37:41,724
Man, it's so beat I had to leave it on Market Street for the vultures.

1099
01:37:41,766 --> 01:37:42,766
Oh, shit.

1100
01:37:47,599 --> 01:37:48,307
And Marylou?

1101
01:37:48,349 --> 01:37:51,432
That dumb little box married one of her sailors.

1102
01:37:53,516 --> 01:37:56,905
And he's threatened to kill me if he finds me, so I'm gonna have to defend myself

1103
01:37:56,906 --> 01:37:59,282
and kill him and go to San Quentin for life.

1104
01:37:59,724 --> 01:38:01,307
That would be the end of me.

1105
01:38:01,349 --> 01:38:03,016
Oh, come on

1106
01:38:07,849 --> 01:38:08,766
How's your ma?

1107
01:38:08,807 --> 01:38:11,516
Still waiting for that 15 bucks you owe her !

1108
01:38:14,224 --> 01:38:16,057
Yeah, one day...

1109
01:38:16,099 --> 01:38:18,391
Guess what.

1110
01:38:18,391 --> 01:38:20,724
I'm gonna be a father again.

1111
01:38:20,766 --> 01:38:22,099
Really?

1112
01:38:22,141 --> 01:38:22,766
Yeah.

1113
01:38:22,807 --> 01:38:28,349
Sweet little Amy, she can stand alone for 30 seconds, she's 22 pounds and 29 inches long.

1114
01:38:28,391 --> 01:38:32,347
And I found out that she's 31 one fourth percent English,

1115
01:38:32,348 --> 01:38:34,579
27 and a half percent German,

1116
01:38:34,580 --> 01:38:37,979
27 percent Irish, 8 and three fourths percent Dutch,

1117
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:41,211
7 percent Scotch and one hundred percent wonderful.

1118
01:38:41,807 --> 01:38:43,349
Yes.

1119
01:38:59,057 --> 01:39:00,057
Hush.

1120
01:39:06,349 --> 01:39:07,891
Ahh, heebie jeebies !

1121
01:39:07,932 --> 01:39:10,557
We gotta find ourselves some kicks.

1122
01:39:19,599 --> 01:39:20,807
Sal's here.

1123
01:39:20,849 --> 01:39:22,224
I heard.

1124
01:39:24,391 --> 01:39:26,682
He wants to take me out to hear some music.

1125
01:39:26,724 --> 01:39:28,016
You wish to come?

1126
01:39:29,391 --> 01:39:31,682
Who's gonna stay here and take care of Amy?

1127
01:39:31,724 --> 01:39:33,932
Alright then, I'll just go.

1128
01:39:45,349 --> 01:39:49,807
Dean, don't make yourself feel better by asking me along

1129
01:39:50,515 --> 01:39:51,932
I'll be back in a little bit.

1130
01:40:08,057 --> 01:40:08,599
Sal !

1131
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:10,974
By Marylou's cunt, it can't be !

1132
01:40:11,474 --> 01:40:12,099
What?

1133
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:17,339
That's 1.10 a ticket and a dime each for the jackets.

1134
01:40:17,765 --> 01:40:19,557
Can I hear a vouchii?

1135
01:40:19,599 --> 01:40:20,682
Vouchii !

1136
01:40:20,724 --> 01:40:22,974
Can I hear a sharooni mo' mo' mo' mo' mo'?

1137
01:40:23,015 --> 01:40:25,265
Sharooni mo' mo'mo'mo'!

1138
01:40:25,307 --> 01:40:26,474
You left out one mo' !

1139
01:40:26,474 --> 01:40:27,349
Let me hear that last mo' !

1140
01:40:27,349 --> 01:40:27,890
Mo' !

1141
01:40:27,890 --> 01:40:28,724
Mo'!

1142
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:32,515
No way

1143
01:40:33,265 --> 01:40:34,099
Yip-rok!

1144
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:35,349
Hereesi!

1145
01:41:06,807 --> 01:41:10,099
Look at that, Slim knows time, Sal !

1146
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:10,932
He knows time !

1147
01:41:44,432 --> 01:41:45,140
Thank you !

1148
01:41:45,182 --> 01:41:50,474
But most important my sure-ooni mo' loves you !

1149
01:41:53,390 --> 01:41:54,140
Goodness !

1150
01:41:54,182 --> 01:41:55,974
Oh my goodness !

1151
01:41:56,015 --> 01:41:57,870
You are the bee's knees.

1152
01:41:57,871 --> 01:42:00,934
Wanna take you home and wake up with fleas.

1153
01:42:00,935 --> 01:42:04,627
Please, say hello to my future ex-wife!

1154
01:42:27,890 --> 01:42:28,599
Hey, Camille !

1155
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:31,140
Congratulations on the baby.

1156
01:42:31,224 --> 01:42:32,224
If you.

1157
01:42:32,307 --> 01:42:33,557
Sal, excuse me.

1158
01:42:33,599 --> 01:42:35,307
Dean, I need to talk to you.

1159
01:42:40,557 --> 01:42:41,807
I want you to get out.

1160
01:42:43,099 --> 01:42:43,849
Just go.

1161
01:42:43,849 --> 01:42:44,557
Just get out.

1162
01:42:44,599 --> 01:42:45,432
Now, honey...

1163
01:42:45,474 --> 01:42:45,890
No.

1164
01:42:45,932 --> 01:42:49,349
You said you were going to take care of us and you were done fooling around.

1165
01:42:52,765 --> 01:42:54,474
I know that look on your face, Dean.

1166
01:42:55,307 --> 01:42:56,265
You're bored.

1167
01:42:56,307 --> 01:43:00,515
You're sick of me, and you're sick of work, and the baby.

1168
01:43:00,557 --> 01:43:01,265
I wanna.

1169
01:43:01,307 --> 01:43:05,473
I just want you to take your friend and get out of my house.

1170
01:43:15,307 --> 01:43:17,182
Do you realize how much I've given up for you?

1171
01:43:40,932 --> 01:43:44,057
I never want you back.

1172
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:45,848
I never want to see you again !

1173
01:43:55,932 --> 01:43:57,515
I'll see you very soon, I promise.

1174
01:43:59,682 --> 01:44:01,307
Don't you dare lie to her, too.

1175
01:44:01,348 --> 01:44:02,473
You're a liar.

1176
01:44:02,473 --> 01:44:04,057
You're a liar.

1177
01:44:06,473 --> 01:44:09,473
Liar... Liar...

1178
01:45:24,182 --> 01:45:28,723
I realized as we racked our brains for where to go and what to do, that it was up to me.

1179
01:45:32,515 --> 01:45:36,640
I counted my money and showed it to Dean and said, "Come to New York (with me)."

1180
01:45:36,682 --> 01:45:38,848
"Let's go to Denver first," he said.

1181
01:45:38,890 --> 01:45:42,390
"This time we must absolutely find my father, Sal!"

1182
01:45:47,057 --> 01:45:48,390
Your signature here...

1183
01:45:48,598 --> 01:45:51,557
We're taking the semi-pristine Chrysler to Kansas.

1184
01:45:51,765 --> 01:45:54,890
Along with yourselves, there's a nice young married couple.

1185
01:45:54,932 --> 01:45:57,890
We share the gas expenses equally among the five of us.

1186
01:45:59,807 --> 01:46:01,473
Are we all copacetic on that score gentlemen?

1187
01:46:04,598 --> 01:46:05,557
Yeah.

1188
01:46:59,431 --> 01:47:00,223
Ola

1189
01:47:03,890 --> 01:47:09,306
I'm very glad you have accepted my invitation to a few drinks after that perilous journey.

1190
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:10,890
Ah, no problem, amigo.

1191
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:17,348
Thank you.

1192
01:47:23,431 --> 01:47:24,473
Hmm, whiskey

1193
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:36,223
I like young men like you.

1194
01:47:38,765 --> 01:47:41,723
You probably don't believe it, but, uh.

1195
01:47:44,015 --> 01:47:48,056
the truth is, I really don't like girls.

1196
01:47:48,098 --> 01:47:49,765
I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.

1197
01:47:49,806 --> 01:47:51,765
Excuse me.

1198
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:10,140
To tell you the straight deal, I sometimes had to survive the streets of Denver by working far into the night.

1199
01:48:12,098 --> 01:48:13,598
Yes, I can appreciate, uh...

1200
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:16,056
"Never leave a customer unsatisfied."

1201
01:48:16,098 --> 01:48:18,598
I had that tattooed on my ass.

1202
01:48:24,931 --> 01:48:28,473
Perhaps there will be some money involved...

1203
01:48:30,390 --> 01:48:31,765
Oh, yeah?

1204
01:49:01,098 --> 01:49:01,681
Ah.

1205
01:49:01,723 --> 01:49:03,306
Ah.

1206
01:49:03,348 --> 01:49:04,348
Jesus !

1207
01:49:20,473 --> 01:49:22,973
Denver, Colorado

1208
01:49:40,890 --> 01:49:41,681
You see?

1209
01:49:41,723 --> 01:49:44,348
You give them what they secretly want and they just panic.

1210
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:54,973
And here you go.

1211
01:49:55,015 --> 01:49:56,056
Club, extra mayo.

1212
01:49:56,098 --> 01:49:57,806
Enjoy.

1213
01:50:02,348 --> 01:50:04,389
Look, I did it for us, man.

1214
01:50:04,431 --> 01:50:05,639
I got twenty bucks off the old fag.

1215
01:50:35,723 --> 01:50:38,764
My old man, a little guy, Moriarty.

1216
01:50:38,806 --> 01:50:40,639
Known in these parts as "the Barber".

1217
01:50:40,681 --> 01:50:42,348
"Moriarty"?

1218
01:50:42,389 --> 01:50:43,723
No.

1219
01:50:43,764 --> 01:50:45,139
Never heard of him.

1220
01:50:56,723 --> 01:50:57,764
Sorry, son.

1221
01:50:57,806 --> 01:50:59,639
I ain't seen your old man in.

1222
01:50:59,639 --> 01:51:01,223
I don't know how many years.

1223
01:51:44,139 --> 01:51:45,223
New York, 1950

1224
01:51:54,223 --> 01:51:56,181
How long have we known each other?

1225
01:51:56,223 --> 01:51:57,639
5 years?

1226
01:51:57,681 --> 01:51:58,764
5 pretty good years.

1227
01:51:58,806 --> 01:51:59,889
Who are we now?

1228
01:51:59,973 --> 01:52:01,681
Who are we, yes?

1229
01:52:01,723 --> 01:52:02,598
Who are we now?

1230
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:04,014
ah, a simple question.

1231
01:52:04,056 --> 01:52:05,639
Are you gonna tell us, Carlo?

1232
01:52:07,723 --> 01:52:08,764
I know I'm 23.

1233
01:52:11,139 --> 01:52:16,056
I know that I rely on my friends and my family for money...

1234
01:52:16,098 --> 01:52:17,264
Ah, ah.

1235
01:52:17,306 --> 01:52:18,764
Join that club, please !

1236
01:52:18,806 --> 01:52:20,389
I know I will.

1237
01:52:20,389 --> 01:52:22,056
I know there's no gold at the end of the rainbow.

1238
01:52:23,598 --> 01:52:26,306
There's just shit and piss.

1239
01:52:26,348 --> 01:52:29,723
But to know that, that makes me free.

1240
01:53:13,139 --> 01:53:15,473
<i>You come in contact with social controls.</i>

1241
01:53:17,139 --> 01:53:21,139
<i>With custom, with moral code, and with law.</i>

1242
01:53:21,223 --> 01:53:25,723
<i>The town or city in which you live has laws which control you.</i>

1243
01:53:25,764 --> 01:53:29,847
<i>There are state laws, and the federal government in your name...</i>

1244
01:53:45,597 --> 01:53:47,056
Mexico, huh?

1245
01:53:49,514 --> 01:53:51,722
Damn Sal, that's big

1246
01:53:53,139 --> 01:53:54,431
You know, I've been thinking.

1247
01:53:55,806 --> 01:53:56,931
I've never been south.

1248
01:53:59,139 --> 01:54:01,931
Damn, Sal, I wish you weren't going.

1249
01:54:01,972 --> 01:54:05,472
It'll be my first timein ol' New York without my good boy.

1250
01:54:10,139 --> 01:54:11,097
Shit, Sal.

1251
01:54:11,139 --> 01:54:13,472
We haven't talked straight in a long time.

1252
01:54:16,181 --> 01:54:17,181
Yeah, I know.

1253
01:54:17,222 --> 01:54:18,681
Yeah.

1254
01:54:18,722 --> 01:54:20,097
You see, man.

1255
01:54:21,306 --> 01:54:24,306
The older you get, those troubles just keep piling on.

1256
01:54:31,931 --> 01:54:32,889
Look at this.

1257
01:54:37,181 --> 01:54:38,222
That's Joanie.

1258
01:54:39,556 --> 01:54:41,347
Look at that smile, too.

1259
01:54:41,389 --> 01:54:43,306
Ain't she gonna break some hearts

1260
01:54:43,306 --> 01:54:44,556
Yeah.

1261
01:54:46,722 --> 01:54:47,764
She's beautiful.

1262
01:54:54,181 --> 01:54:55,889
Did I tell you Marylou's pregnant?

1263
01:54:59,181 --> 01:55:01,764
Well if it speaks French-Canadian, it's a complete coincidence

1264
01:55:07,181 --> 01:55:08,639
(laughs) Shit

1265
01:55:15,847 --> 01:55:16,764
I'll leave you to it.

1266
01:55:19,889 --> 01:55:20,972
Thanks for the visit.

1267
01:55:22,347 --> 01:55:23,181
I'll write you.

1268
01:55:23,222 --> 01:55:24,931
I know you will.

1269
01:55:30,639 --> 01:55:31,514
Take care buddy.

1270
01:55:31,556 --> 01:55:32,347
Go get 'em !

1271
01:55:41,097 --> 01:55:41,806
Hey, Sal !

1272
01:55:43,264 --> 01:55:45,931
Now you know I habla la espanol, don't you?

1273
01:56:10,847 --> 01:56:12,222
La Estrella, Mexico

1274
01:56:20,097 --> 01:56:20,639
Gracias

1275
01:56:21,181 --> 01:56:22,389
Sir, sir !

1276
01:56:22,472 --> 01:56:23,389
Do you like it?

1277
01:56:23,431 --> 01:56:24,472
60 pesos.

1278
01:56:25,681 --> 01:56:26,472
No, gracias.

1279
01:56:28,056 --> 01:56:28,639
Hey kid !

1280
01:56:28,722 --> 01:56:30,889
You got any marijuana?

1281
01:56:30,931 --> 01:56:32,222
Marijuana?

1282
01:56:32,264 --> 01:56:32,889
Si.

1283
01:56:32,931 --> 01:56:33,847
Si si si.

1284
01:56:50,972 --> 01:56:54,056
Those are my brothers, my sister and my grandmother too.

1285
01:56:57,181 --> 01:56:58,306
Well, shit.

1286
01:57:21,597 --> 01:57:24,055
Your 'ma could learn a few lessons from this kid's grandma.

1287
01:57:26,097 --> 01:57:27,055
A man of word !

1288
01:57:31,305 --> 01:57:32,014
Victor.

1289
01:57:33,097 --> 01:57:36,514
This is the biggest bomber of tea I have ever smoked

1290
01:57:40,347 --> 01:57:41,430
What's his name?

1291
01:57:42,764 --> 01:57:43,555
Thomas.

1292
01:57:46,347 --> 01:57:47,305
Thomas.

1293
01:57:47,347 --> 01:57:48,139
Thomas.

1294
01:57:52,805 --> 01:57:53,555
(In car)Thomas?...

1295
01:58:08,097 --> 01:58:09,430
"El Paraiso" !

1296
01:58:26,514 --> 01:58:27,055
Hola (or CLUB OWNER?

1297
01:58:27,097 --> 01:58:28,805
) Hola, welcome to paradise !

1298
01:58:28,847 --> 01:58:31,305
CLUB OWNER Do you like girls?

1299
01:59:42,305 --> 01:59:49,514
Mucho, mucho loveMexico City is the holy place for more !

1300
01:59:51,305 --> 01:59:51,889
You're the best.

1301
01:59:51,930 --> 01:59:52,389
Gracias.

1302
01:59:52,430 --> 01:59:52,972
Thank you.

1303
01:59:57,930 --> 01:59:59,180
Look at this traffic, Sal !

1304
01:59:59,180 --> 02:00:00,597
Everybody just goes !

1305
02:00:04,014 --> 02:00:05,222
Dig those faces.

1306
02:00:05,264 --> 02:00:06,805
I want to be one of them !

1307
02:00:12,597 --> 02:00:13,430
Now we gotta eat this.

1308
02:00:21,139 --> 02:00:21,764
.How much?

1309
02:00:21,805 --> 02:00:26,639
We've got so much, we're rich !

1310
02:00:35,972 --> 02:00:37,305
They look just like us.

1311
02:00:37,347 --> 02:00:38,388
See, they're brothers !

1312
02:00:44,305 --> 02:00:47,097
My brother, I can smell the marijuana !

1313
02:00:48,472 --> 02:00:49,263
Yes !

1314
02:01:16,055 --> 02:01:21,513
Voyager, c'est bien utile, ga fait travailler l'imagination.

1315
02:01:21,555 --> 02:01:24,805
Tout le reste n'est que deceptions et fatigues.

1316
02:01:24,805 --> 02:01:27,347
Prends soin de ta mere.

1317
02:01:27,347 --> 02:01:31,930
To the good, old, dead, demented men we love.

1318
02:01:31,930 --> 02:01:33,430
Voila sa force.

1319
02:01:33,430 --> 02:01:35,347
Il va de la vie a la mort.

1320
02:01:35,347 --> 02:01:36,097
To the West.

1321
02:01:36,097 --> 02:01:38,180
To the West.

1322
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:39,347
"You got no calluses, Sal."

1323
02:01:40,805 --> 02:01:42,847
C'est un moment...

1324
02:01:46,222 --> 02:01:47,472
Notre voyage a nous est entierement imaginaire.

1325
02:01:47,513 --> 02:01:49,263
"(indistinct dialogue, baby crying) C'est oublie!

1326
02:01:49,305 --> 02:01:50,347
I've never been able to kill myself.

1327
02:01:50,388 --> 02:01:52,888
I am at your immediate disposal.

1328
02:01:52,888 --> 02:01:54,388
Immediate disposal.

1329
02:01:54,430 --> 02:01:58,013
Because you've crushed all the poetry you had in you.

1330
02:01:58,055 --> 02:02:04,013
Take a close look at yourself and the degree of rottenness you've come to.

1331
02:02:05,263 --> 02:02:07,055
You can't deny the blood guilt.

1332
02:02:07,097 --> 02:02:08,347
You 're white.

1333
02:02:08,388 --> 02:02:09,722
White!

1334
02:02:09,763 --> 02:02:11,680
White

1335
02:02:26,638 --> 02:02:28,305
Poor Sal got sick.

1336
02:02:28,347 --> 02:02:29,680
Poor Sal got sick.

1337
02:02:32,138 --> 02:02:33,680
Dysentery, man.

1338
02:02:36,972 --> 02:02:39,472
Now listen if you can hear in your sickness, my boy.

1339
02:02:39,555 --> 02:02:43,805
I got my divorce with Camille down here, and I gotta get back if the car can hold up.

1340
02:02:45,805 --> 02:02:46,805
Not that again.

1341
02:02:49,180 --> 02:02:50,930
All that again, good buddy.

1342
02:02:50,972 --> 02:02:52,138
I've got to get back to my life.

1343
02:02:53,305 --> 02:02:54,722
Wish I didn't have to go.

1344
02:03:08,722 --> 02:03:10,347
Yes, yes, yes.

1345
02:03:10,388 --> 02:03:12,388
I gotta go now, ol' fever Sal.

1346
02:03:17,638 --> 02:03:18,555
Goodbye.

1347
02:04:07,180 --> 02:04:08,055
Ozone Park, 1951

1348
02:04:17,221 --> 02:04:17,763
Humm.

1349
02:04:17,805 --> 02:04:19,013
Pour toi.

1350
02:04:21,971 --> 02:04:22,721
Merci.

1351
02:04:33,471 --> 02:04:36,268
(Book title) Denver Doldrums- For S.P. and D.M.

1352
02:04:36,268 --> 02:04:39,114
the secret heroes of these poems - Poems by Carlo Marx

1353
02:04:46,763 --> 02:04:53,286
I would rather go mad, gone down the track to Mexico, heroin dripping in my veins,

1354
02:04:53,287 --> 02:05:01,790
eyes and ears full of marijuana, eating the god Peyote on the floor of a mudhut on the border...

1355
02:05:02,388 --> 02:05:07,783
rather jar my body down the road, crying by a diner in the Western sun;

1356
02:05:07,784 --> 02:05:19,022
rather crawl on my naked belly over tincans in Cincinnati; rather drag a rotten railroad tieto a Golgotha in the Rockies;

1357
02:05:19,023 --> 02:05:25,061
rather crowned with thorns in Galveston; nailed hand and foot in Los Angeles;

1358
02:05:25,062 --> 02:05:30,036
raised up to die in Denver; pierced in the side in Chicago;

1359
02:05:30,037 --> 02:05:37,061
perished and tombed in New Orleans; and resurrected somewhere on Garret Mountain.

1360
02:05:46,930 --> 02:05:48,138
December, 1951

1361
02:05:56,471 --> 02:05:57,346
(at a distance, to a woman) Hey.

1362
02:06:09,888 --> 02:06:10,513
Sal?

1363
02:06:13,346 --> 02:06:14,513
Is that you, man?

1364
02:06:17,596 --> 02:06:18,721
(to his friends, very low) Hang on a minute.

1365
02:06:34,180 --> 02:06:35,430
What are you doing in New York, man?

1366
02:06:38,430 --> 02:06:39,763
Dear Sal...

1367
02:06:42,471 --> 02:06:44,680
I came on the railroad pass.

1368
02:06:44,721 --> 02:06:46,513
Old hard bench coaches.

1369
02:06:47,763 --> 02:06:49,471
Crossing railroads.

1370
02:06:49,555 --> 02:06:56,305
Long, long awful trip, five days and nights, just to see you, Sal.

1371
02:06:58,846 --> 02:06:59,596
Are you alright?

1372
02:07:01,971 --> 02:07:02,888
How's Camille?

1373
02:07:02,930 --> 02:07:04,846
How are the babies?

1374
02:07:21,888 --> 02:07:25,305
(then reading)"Dear Dean, Its the end of the first half of the century.

1375
02:07:25,346 --> 02:07:29,429
Welcome with love and kisses to spend the other half with us.

1376
02:07:32,388 --> 02:07:33,554
We all wait for you.

1377
02:07:33,554 --> 02:07:36,471
Camille, Amy and little Joanie."

1378
02:07:36,513 --> 02:07:38,763
That's great

1379
02:07:38,763 --> 02:07:39,346
Yeah.

1380
02:07:49,638 --> 02:07:55,888
We still haven't talked of Mexico, and us leaving, and the fever of last year.

1381
02:07:55,929 --> 02:07:56,638
But we don't...

1382
02:07:56,679 --> 02:07:58,138
Hey Sal, we gotta go, man !

1383
02:07:58,929 --> 02:08:01,179
We don't have to talk about that right now.

1384
02:08:01,221 --> 02:08:01,804
No.

1385
02:08:02,929 --> 02:08:03,596
Hey.

1386
02:08:03,638 --> 02:08:05,638
Hey Sal, for Christ's sake.

1387
02:08:05,679 --> 02:08:07,888
Duke Ellington ain't gonna wait

1388
02:08:08,304 --> 02:08:09,554
Yeah, just give me a minute, Remi !

1389
02:08:09,596 --> 02:08:11,721
They're all waiting.

1390
02:08:13,096 --> 02:08:13,763
Do you think.

1391
02:08:13,804 --> 02:08:16,471
you can give me a ride to East 14th?

1392
02:08:16,471 --> 02:08:20,804
I want to spend as much time with my boy as possible, you know.

1393
02:08:22,804 --> 02:08:25,888
Man, I wish we didn't have tickets to this concert.

1394
02:08:29,679 --> 02:08:30,221
Yeah.

1395
02:08:48,679 --> 02:08:49,763
Bye, Dean.

1396
02:08:59,263 --> 02:08:59,971
Hey, Sal !

1397
02:09:04,596 --> 02:09:05,679
I love you as ever.

1398
02:10:23,596 --> 02:10:30,971
I first met Dean not long after my father died...

1399
02:10:33,721 --> 02:10:35,429
(singing) Oh I got a pretty little girl...

1400
02:10:35,429 --> 02:10:38,888
Dean, I'll be goddamned!

1401
02:10:38,888 --> 02:10:40,054
You're early...

1402
02:10:40,054 --> 02:10:40,471
Yeah, well...

1403
02:10:40,471 --> 02:10:42,721
around my finger...

1404
02:10:42,721 --> 02:10:44,429
I was in reform school all the time.

1405
02:10:45,263 --> 02:10:48,054
I was like a young punk asserting myself......

1406
02:10:53,846 --> 02:10:57,013
and she stands on her head and she does the splits......

1407
02:10:57,054 --> 02:10:58,887
"I need your cock!

1408
02:10:58,929 --> 02:11:03,387
"The only people that interest me are the mad ones...

1409
02:11:03,387 --> 02:11:05,471
Mad to live, mad to talk...

1410
02:11:09,512 --> 02:11:11,512
<i>... the West coast and come crashing down to earth...</i>

1411
02:11:11,554 --> 02:11:14,804
And the sound of the wild...

1412
02:11:14,846 --> 02:11:15,971
Bless me, Father, for I will sin

1413
02:11:16,012 --> 02:11:16,971
Man, I just love women!

1414
02:11:17,012 --> 02:11:18,137
I just want a house...

1415
02:11:18,179 --> 02:11:19,054
Ah, shit, Dean!

1416
02:11:19,054 --> 02:11:19,387
a baby.

1417
02:11:19,429 --> 02:11:19,971
Sal.

1418
02:11:20,012 --> 02:11:21,637
I've come to ask you to teach me how to write.

1419
02:11:21,679 --> 02:11:28,783
(singing)And it's hard, ain't it hard, to love what you kill

1420
02:11:28,783 --> 02:11:29,598
That Hudson goes!

1421
02:11:39,426 --> 02:11:40,141
Hey, Sal !

1422
02:11:45,879 --> 02:11:49,313
I love you as ever.

1423
02:12:02,462 --> 02:12:10,087
So in America, when the sun goes down and I sit on the old, broken-down river pier, watching the long long skies over New Jersey,

1424
02:12:10,087 --> 02:12:15,546
and sense all that raw land that rolls in one unbelievable huge bulge over to the West coast,

1425
02:12:15,587 --> 02:12:22,546
and all of that road going, and all the people dreaming in the immensity of it,

1426
02:12:22,546 --> 02:12:27,796
and in Iowa I know by now that the evening star must be drooping and shedding her sparkler dims on the prairie,

1427
02:12:27,796 --> 02:12:32,246
which is just before the coming of complete night that blesses the Earth,

1428
02:12:32,247 --> 02:12:36,872
darkens all rivers, cups the peaks and folds the final shore in,

1429
02:12:36,907 --> 02:12:40,270
and nobody, nobody knows what is going to happen to anybody,

1430
02:12:40,271 --> 02:12:43,707
besides the forlorn rags of growing old,

1431
02:12:44,712 --> 02:12:49,785
I think of Dean Moriarty, I even think of old Dean Moriarty, the father we never found,

1432
02:12:50,831 --> 02:12:55,157
I think of Dean Moriarty, I think of Dean Moriarty.

1433
02:13:15,296 --> 02:13:16,046
Can you hear me now?

1434
02:13:18,921 --> 02:13:19,921
But anyway...

1435
02:13:21,820 --> 02:13:25,254
Tonight also, I wrote a song, called "On the Road".

1436
02:13:26,385 --> 02:13:29,421
I'm just rather reading what I wrote all night.

1437
02:13:29,462 --> 02:13:32,337
There are better things coming than what I wrote all night.

1438
02:13:32,379 --> 02:13:37,587
Straight from the mind to the voice, with no hand intervening.

1439
02:13:37,629 --> 02:13:45,254
(singing) I left New York, 1949To go across the country without a dad-blame dime.

1440
02:13:45,254 --> 02:13:56,462
Montana in the cold, cold fall Found my father in the gambling hallFather, Father where have you been?

1441
02:13:56,504 --> 02:14:00,087
You've been in the world since I was a teen.

1442
02:14:03,212 --> 02:14:10,171
Dear son, he said, don't worry about me I'm about to die of pleurisy

1443
02:14:13,796 --> 02:14:19,587
Cross the Mississippi, cross the Tennessee Cross the Niagara,

1444
02:14:19,629 --> 02:14:21,337
home I'll never be.

1445
02:14:21,379 --> 02:14:29,004
Home in Ol'Medora, home in Ol' Truckee Apalachicola, home I'll never be.

1446
02:14:29,045 --> 02:14:36,254
For better or worse, through thick and thinLike being married to the little woman.

1447
02:14:36,295 --> 02:14:44,545
God loved me just like I loved himI want you do the same just for him.

1448
02:14:44,587 --> 02:14:48,795
The worms eat away but don't worry, watch the wind.

1449
02:14:48,837 --> 02:14:51,712
The worms eat away but don't worry watch the wind.

1450
02:14:54,064 --> 02:14:57,533
So I left Montana on an ol'freight train

1451
02:14:57,534 --> 02:15:01,097
The night my father died in the cold, cold rain.

1452
02:15:01,132 --> 02:15:08,980
Rode up to Opelousas, rode to Wounded Knee, Rode to Ogallala, home I'll never be.

1453
02:15:09,015 --> 02:15:11,114
Home I'll never be.

1454
02:19:11,115 --> 02:20:12,115
