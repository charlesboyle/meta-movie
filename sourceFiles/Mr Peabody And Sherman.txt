1
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,226
Our story begins high
over New York City...

2
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,978
in the luxurious
penthouse apartment...

3
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,758
of perhaps the most unlikely
genius the world has ever known.

4
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,318
Oh. Sorry. You caught
me doing my yoga.

5
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,556
You were expecting
downward dog, perhaps?

6
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,160
My name is Mr. Peabody. And since we're
going to be spending some time together...

7
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,371
I'd like to tell you a
little bit about myself.

8
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:23,950
You see, ever since I was a pup...
it was clear that I was different.

9
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,128
I tried to fit in...

10
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,254
No, thank you.

11
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,282
But never could.

12
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,050
As I grew, I saw more and
more of my littermates...

13
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,125
being chosen by their new families.

14
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,754
But for some reason, I never was.

15
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,758
Come on, boy! Fetch the stick!

16
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,063
But why? Won't you
just throw it again?

17
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,524
It's an exercise in futility.

18
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,193
I don't want this one,
Mommy. He's sarcastic.

19
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,362
Wait, wait! Come back!
Throw the stick.

20
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,240
I'll stay, I'll heel,
I'll even shake hands.

21
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,950
Bark, bark?

22
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,287
So, without a family of my own...

23
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,040
I dedicated myself to
the pursuit of knowledge...

24
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,459
culture, and athletics.

25
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,254
I received my degree at Harvard.

26
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,173
Vale-dog-torian, of course.

27
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,299
Yay!

28
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,385
And then, I devoted myself
to helping mankind.

29
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,221
I pioneered new techniques
in alternative energy.

30
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,600
Yay!

31
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,470
Resolved geopolitical
conflicts around the globe.

32
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,565
And in my spare time...

33
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,234
I invented the fist bump,
planking, tearaway pants...

34
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,402
Auto-Tune...

35
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,695
the backside ollie...

36
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:35,863
and Zumba.

37
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,811
Now go

38
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,396
Stop

39
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,940
Drop

40
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,937
Pause

41
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,999
But what I'm most proud of
is my son, Sherman.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,168
Hi, Mr. Peabody.

43
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,005
Oh! Have you told
them about the WABAC?

44
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,257
I was just getting to that.

45
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,761
When I adopted Sherman, I vowed
to be the best father I could be.

46
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,138
To prepare him for all
the wonders of the world,

47
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,932
present and past.

48
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:07,679
And so, Sherman inspired the
greatest invention of my life...

49
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,677
a time machine.

50
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:20,366
Of course, time travel
can be a bit unpredictable.

51
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,202
There are bound to be
a few mishaps along the way.

52
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,704
Let's just say,
the Leaning Tower of Pisa

53
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,706
wasn't always leaning.

54
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:27,957
But there's nothing like learning

55
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,166
the lessons of history firsthand.

56
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,292
Right, Sherman?

57
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,336
Where are we going
today, Mr. Peabody?

58
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,963
Not "where," Sherman.

59
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,207
"When."

60
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,981
Whoa! This is the biggest
house I've ever seen!

61
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:55,025
It's the Palace of Versailles,
home of Marie Antoinette.

62
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,653
You know, she was mostly
famous for one thing.

63
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,029
Cake!

64
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,491
I love cake so much.

65
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,373
Marie Antoinette sure
likes cake, Mr. Peabody.

66
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,666
- Oh!
- Indeed she does.

67
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,668
Marie was a woman with a
prodigious appetite...

68
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,837
for all things
covered with frosting.

69
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:18,174
But her expensive tastes made her
the target of much criticism.

70
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,009
- Why?
- Because, Sherman...

71
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,677
during Marie's reign,
the common people

72
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,580
of France were exceedingly poor.

73
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,347
You've got any bread?

74
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,592
No! I'm exceedingly poor.

75
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,352
Now, can we have some cake?

76
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,520
Mais, oui.

77
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,190
Oh, yeah, sorry.

78
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,858
"May we" have some cake?

79
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,431
Mais, oui!

80
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,195
Maybe she can't hear me
through the hair.

81
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,489
Sherman, what the queen means is...

82
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,894
Ah! Let them eat cake!

83
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,873
When the queen heard the poor of
Paris could not even buy bread...

84
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,292
she said, "Let them eat cake."

85
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,251
No!

86
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,586
I heard it myself.

87
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:56,921
- It's a scandal!
- It's an outrage!

88
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,130
Down with the queen!

89
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,532
Down with the monarchy!

90
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,758
Wait!

91
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,786
What kind of cake?

92
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,478
Smashing party, Your Majesty.

93
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,147
But now, I'm afraid
Sherman and I must be...

94
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,566
Sherman? Sherman?

95
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,685
Sherman!

96
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,311
Sherman?

97
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,144
Sherman! Here, Sherman.

98
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,745
Hey, Mr. Peabody.

99
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,622
What are you doing in here?

100
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,998
Trying these other cakes.

101
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:37,745
There's one in here with whipped
cream and strawberries that's...

102
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,129
pretty fantastic!

103
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,422
Sherman...

104
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,424
don't you remember
why I told you to stay

105
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,426
close to me during
the French Revolution?

106
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,303
Because after
the French Revolution...

107
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,097
- it was gonna rain?
- Close.

108
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,599
I said, "After the
French Revolution comes...

109
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,810
the Reign of Terror!"

110
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,193
Round up the aristocrats.

111
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,711
The queen and her
aristocratic cronies...

112
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,630
must pay the price
for their gluttony.

113
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,717
We will slaughter them
like the dogs they are.

114
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,041
Starting with this one!

115
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,538
Mr. Peabody!

116
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,472
What should I do?

117
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,475
Nothing, Sherman.
Just stay right there.

118
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,810
But, Mr. Peabody!

119
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,812
Everything is going
to be fine, Sherman.

120
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,887
Just stay right there.

121
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,107
Off with his head!

122
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,192
Mr. Peabody!

123
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,002
A cantaloupe?

124
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,921
The lowest of the fruits.

125
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,747
Who dares to insult me
with this melon?

126
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,294
Get that dog!

127
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,017
Mr. Peabody, how did you escape?

128
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,226
It's simple, Sherman.

129
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,103
I noticed the distance
between the sewer lids...

130
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,521
reasoned that there must be one

131
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,898
directly under
the guillotine platform...

132
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,524
noted the loose board
under the basket...

133
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,692
computed the angle at
which the setting sun

134
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,944
would bounce off your glasses...

135
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,904
momentarily blinding
the executioner...

136
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,906
and chose that moment to swipe
the executioner's melon...

137
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:32,076
giving me the added weight to tip
the boards, facilitating my exit.

138
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,410
That's amazing!

139
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,578
It's not amazing.

140
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,039
It was just a matter
of keeping my head.

141
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,192
"Keeping your head."

142
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,626
I don't get it.

143
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,045
There he is! After them!

144
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,119
Come, Sherman, quick!

145
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,761
Oh, this water tastes terrible.

146
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,721
Interestingly, that's not water.

147
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,010
Ha-ha!

148
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,553
I've got you now.

149
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,983
Indeed you have,
Monsieur Robespierre.

150
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,860
And what a master
of the chase you are.

151
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,070
Oh, you noticed?

152
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,196
Of course.

153
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,739
Doubling back on me like that.

154
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,991
That was genius.

155
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,158
Thank you.

156
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,244
I just hope you don't take
my little confederate, here.

157
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,912
I depend on him so completely.

158
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,163
Get over here, you.

159
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,915
Drats! You're devilishly clever.

160
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,459
I know. And much quicker
than you as well.

161
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,128
But are you quick enough for this?

162
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,754
Ha-ha! See? Quick!

163
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,840
Quick, yes, but not too smart.

164
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,539
Oh! Another cantaloupe!

165
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,994
Your sword!

166
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,054
All right, Sherman,
looks like it's time

167
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,973
for a little pop quiz
in the art of fencing.

168
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,266
Go!

169
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,810
Attack! Parry! Thrust! Repeat!

170
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,520
- No.
- Remise!

171
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,896
Good boy!

172
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,034
Oh!

173
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,495
Huh?

174
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,955
Ha-ha! You missed!

175
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,123
I never miss.

176
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,613
Hop on!

177
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,214
Whoa!

178
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,467
Whoa! Whoa!

179
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,747
Yeah! Whoa!

180
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,057
Yeah!

181
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,558
Do you smell that, Sherman?

182
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,060
It wasn't me, Mr. Peabody.

183
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,144
I know it wasn't you.

184
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,979
It's the methane gas
in the sewer system.

185
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,149
And given the fact that it ignites
at 306 degrees Fahrenheit...

186
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,317
we're about to use it...

187
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,061
to blast out of here!

188
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,396
Hang on!

189
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,562
Whoo!

190
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,071
Wow!

191
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,914
- Nice landing, eh, Sherman?
- Oof!

192
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,222
So, what did you
learn today, Sherman?

193
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,557
That French Revolution was crazy.

194
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,725
How so?

195
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,103
All those guys getting
their heads chopped off...

196
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,855
and nobody standing up
and saying it wasn't right.

197
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,525
And think, Marie Antoinette could
have avoided the whole revolution...

198
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,151
if she'd simply issued an edict

199
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,861
to distribute
bread amongst the poor.

200
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,696
But then, she couldn't
have had her dessert.

201
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,198
Why not, Mr. Peabody?

202
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,200
Because, Sherman, you can't have

203
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,661
your cake and edict, too.

204
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,539
I don't get it.

205
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,093
Where are we gonna go
tomorrow, Mr. Peabody?

206
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,263
Ancient Rome? The Wild West? 1492?

207
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,891
No, Sherman, tomorrow we won't
be going to any of those places.

208
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,101
Oh. Why not?

209
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,394
Because tomorrow's adventure...

210
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,397
is one that you're going to
be taking all on your own.

211
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,940
What do you mean, Mr. Peabody?

212
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,108
Don't you remember?

213
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,484
It's your first day of school.

214
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,013
- Oh. Can I drive?
- Of course not.

215
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,084
Remember, Sherman,
"I" before "e," except after "c."

216
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,919
I know, Mr. Peabody!

217
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,005
And don't forget about
the commutative principle.

218
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,673
Two plus three
equals three plus two.

219
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,508
I know, Mr. Peabody!

220
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,676
And if you have to
go to the bathroom...

221
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,137
just raise your hand proudly
and say, "I have to go."

222
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,972
I will, Mr. Peabody.

223
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,850
And remember, the No. 2 pencil
is standard for most uses...

224
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,269
but there are times when
a No. 1 comes in handy.

225
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,854
I left a little pencil chart
in your backpack...

226
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,607
which you can consult if it
ever becomes a judgment call.

227
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:35,057
I think I'll be okay!

228
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,530
Okay, bye, Mr. Peabody.

229
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,656
Wait.

230
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,991
- See you after school.
- Sherman!

231
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:44,119
I gotta go. I gotta
sign up for the clubs.

232
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,996
No one is more in
favor of participation

233
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,956
in fraternal organizations than I.

234
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,577
But before you go,
I want you to have this.

235
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,337
Thanks. What is it?

236
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,411
A dog whistle.

237
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,471
It doesn't work, Mr. Peabody.

238
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,849
It works fine, Sherman.

239
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,753
It's just a frequency
only dogs can hear.

240
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,145
Oh, cool.

241
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,856
Let that little keepsake
be a reminder to you...

242
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,150
that no matter what
challenges you face,

243
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,402
no matter how far
away I might seem...

244
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,056
Bye, Mr. Peabody!

245
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,478
I'm with you.

246
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,661
George Washington.

247
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,673
Who can tell me who he is?

248
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,633
Oh, me! I can! I can!

249
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,885
Uh... Sherman.

250
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,846
The first president of the
United States of America.

251
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,181
Good job.

252
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,226
And when President Washington
was a little boy...

253
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:52,229
what kind of tree did he cut down?

254
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,522
Ooh! Ooh, me! Me! Me!

255
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,565
- Penny?
- A cherry tree.

256
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,775
Apocryphal.

257
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,026
What kind of tree is that?

258
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,445
It's not a tree. It's a word.
"Apocryphal."

259
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,281
It means that story is not true.

260
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,032
- Really?
- Yeah.

261
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,118
George Washington never
cut down a cherry tree...

262
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,869
and he never said he couldn't lie.

263
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,872
People made those stories up to
teach kids a lesson about lying...

264
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:11,915
but they're not true.

265
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,250
He did cross the Delaware River,

266
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,211
Christmas night, 1776, though.

267
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,630
My dad took me there this summer.
We crossed it, too.

268
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,033
I fell in.

269
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:26,331
Looks like someone really knows
their history, huh, Penny?

270
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,895
It's really great meeting you guys.

271
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,981
Maybe you can come over
to my house sometime.

272
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,942
I could bring my new model.
It's a hydrogen atom.

273
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,736
You've only got one, huh?

274
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,612
Guess we'll have to split it.

275
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,182
Good one!

276
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,648
Check it, guys.

277
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,664
What do you got there, Sherman?

278
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,124
Kibbles or bits?

279
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,418
Actually, I've got baby carrots,

280
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,992
organic apple juice,
and a tuna sandwich.

281
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,341
It's super-high in omega-3s.

282
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,093
So, you eat human food, huh?

283
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,762
Yeah. Why wouldn't I?

284
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,013
Because you're a dog.

285
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,264
No, I'm not.

286
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,601
Sure you are. Your dad is a
dog, so you're a dog, too.

287
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:15,103
I think you're confused. It's
an adoptive relationship.

288
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,772
- Zip it, Carl.
- Okay.

289
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,346
Here, I'll show you. Fetch!

290
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,612
Go on, doggy. Go get your lunch.

291
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:24,696
Go on.

292
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,781
Go get it.

293
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,618
Ugh. The humiliation.

294
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,454
Sherman, go get your food.

295
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,414
Make like a good little doggy.

296
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,283
Ruff-ruff!

297
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,840
- What's this?
- It's mine!

298
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,425
Give it back!

299
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,874
What is it? A whistle?

300
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,889
Ugh! Stupid thing
doesn't even work.

301
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,557
It's a dog whistle, Penny.

302
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,143
It operates at a frequency
that only dogs can hear.

303
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,895
- Back up, Carl.
- Okay.

304
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,356
Penny, that whistle
is my private property.

305
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,483
- Give it back!
- Jump, doggy, jump.

306
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,818
I am not a dog.

307
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:03,985
Come on, Sherman!

308
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,822
Just admit it.
You're a dog. Say it.

309
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,031
Let me go!

310
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,659
Not until you beg like a dog.

311
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,577
Come on, Sherman. Beg!

312
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,330
Fight, fight, fight!

313
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,836
Mr. Peabody, thank you for coming
in on such short notice...

314
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,171
to discuss
the problem with Sherman.

315
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,173
Oh, it's not a problem
at all, Principal Purdy.

316
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,508
I fully expected this.

317
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,676
- You did?
- Yes.

318
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,137
And, as with all things
Sherman-related, I prepared for it.

319
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,596
Here's a curriculum
that takes Sherman's

320
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,140
advanced preparation
into account...

321
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,891
but won't require you to have
him skip one or more grades.

322
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:35,976
Mr. Peabody...

323
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,520
Here are some pre-algebra worksheets,
an advanced reading list...

324
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,397
and a link to a website I created

325
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,315
so he can start
studying Mandarin Chinese.

326
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,025
It is, after all,
the language of the future.

327
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,110
Mr. Peabody!

328
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,279
I'm not saying he shouldn't study
French, too, Principal Purdy.

329
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,530
I'm saying have him do both.

330
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:49,698
Mr. Peabody!

331
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,491
What? Not enough? Swahili?

332
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,521
Sherman got into a fight today.

333
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,447
Oh, dear.

334
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,374
Pictures were taken...

335
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,948
for insurance purposes.

336
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,037
He bit her.

337
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:16,057
I must say, it doesn't look
good for you, Mr. Peabody.

338
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,311
After all, you are a dog.

339
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,313
Who, may I ask, are you?

340
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,983
I am Ms. Grunion from the Bureau
of Child Safety and Protection.

341
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:29,139
We're required by law to contact
them whenever there's an...

342
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,140
incident.

343
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,075
Sherman has never done
anything like this before.

344
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,744
I'm sure he must have had a reason.

345
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,704
Well, the girl was being
a bit of a bully...

346
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,080
Quiet, Purdy!

347
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,500
It's normal for children to tease.

348
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,169
It's not normal for them to bite.

349
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,005
Clearly, it's because of
how he's being raised.

350
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,799
In my opinion, a dog can never be

351
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,677
a suitable parent to a little boy.

352
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,095
I must point out, Ms. Grunion...

353
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,931
that I won
the right to adopt Sherman

354
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,265
in a court of law.

355
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,419
And the court can
take it away from you.

356
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,773
I'll be coming to your home tomorrow
evening to conduct an investigation.

357
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:08,568
If I discover that you are,
in anyway, an unfit parent...

358
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,690
I will see to it Sherman is
removed from your custody.

359
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,480
Permanently.

360
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:23,322
I hope I've made myself clear.

361
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,118
Crystal.

362
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,592
I'm sorry I bit her, Mr. Peabody.

363
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,135
I won't do it again.

364
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,762
You're darn tooting
you won't do it again.

365
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,807
This kind of wanton violence
is totally unacceptable.

366
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:42,462
And rather uncharacteristic, given
how you feel about Mr. Gandhi.

367
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,013
What on earth provoked it?

368
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,350
She called me a dog.

369
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,858
Well, all right then.

370
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,655
Thank you for telling me.

371
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,577
Try and get some sleep.

372
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,209
I love you, Mr. Peabody.

373
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:18,547
I have a deep regard
for you as well, Sherman.

374
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,987
Close your eyes

375
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,905
Have no fear

376
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:56,301
The master's gone He's on the run

377
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,046
And your daddy's here

378
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:05,549
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

379
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,647
Say a little prayer

380
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,877
Every day, in every way

381
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:34,077
It's getting better and better

382
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:41,463
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

383
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:50,176
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

384
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,270
A hard road to hoe

385
00:19:56,487 --> 00:20:00,312
Yes, it's a long way to go

386
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,485
But in the meantime

387
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,695
Take my hand

388
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:20,711
Life is what happens to you while
you're busy making other plans

389
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:28,886
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

390
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:37,394
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

391
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:40,739
Mr. Peabody...

392
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,949
you are a Nobel
Prize-winning scientist.

393
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,659
An advisor to heads of state.

394
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,578
A captain of industry.

395
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,247
Why would you want to adopt a boy?

396
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,915
Because, Your Honor...

397
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:56,671
when I found Sherman, it reminded
me of how I started out in life.

398
00:20:56,672 --> 00:21:00,675
And now, I want to give him
the one thing I always wanted.

399
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,093
A home.

400
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,846
And you're sure you're capable
of meeting all the challenges...

401
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,848
of raising a human boy?

402
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:10,423
With all due respect,
how hard could it be?

403
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,354
Very well, then.

404
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,523
If a boy can adopt a dog...

405
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:19,599
I see no reason
why a dog cannot adopt a boy.

406
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,033
Da-da!

407
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,659
No, Sherman, not "Da-da."

408
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,037
You shall call me "Mr. Peabody."

409
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,790
Or, in less formal moments,
simply "Peabody."

410
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,709
That's right.

411
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,612
"Mr. Pea-baba."

412
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:41,993
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

413
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,963
What's cooking, Mr. Peabody?

414
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,256
Oh, nothing much.

415
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:24,592
Just a little Dungeness crab with
a passion-fruit basil concassé.

416
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,719
Some truffled quails
in a juniper-berry reduction.

417
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,721
And Baked Alaska.

418
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,432
Wow! Is today some
kind of special occasion?

419
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,517
You could say.

420
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,935
It's not my birthday.

421
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,395
No, it isn't.

422
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:36,604
It's not your birthday.

423
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,939
Right again.

424
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,108
It's not Father's Day. Is it?

425
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,853
Nope. It's not Father's Day.

426
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,071
Ls the president
coming to dinner again?

427
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,240
- No.
- Oh.

428
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:48,741
So, who's coming to dinner?

429
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,286
Let's just say, if the
evening is a success...

430
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:54,361
we can put this whole
"biting" business behind us.

431
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,882
The Petersons! Welcome.

432
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,133
So, he's literally a dog.

433
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,384
Paul!

434
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,552
No, that's all right.

435
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,346
Although, I prefer "literate dog."

436
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,639
That's funny.

437
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,057
Isn't that funny, Paul?

438
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:16,591
He's not a big laugher.

439
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,105
We're so delighted you could
make it on such short notice.

440
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,883
Aren't we, Sherman?

441
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,318
Aren't we, Sherman?

442
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,821
Yeah, we're interested in what's
going on, that's for sure.

443
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,823
Say hello to Penny, Sherman.

444
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,575
Hi, Penny.

445
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,118
Hello, Sherman.

446
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,828
Now, why don't you go show Penny

447
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,580
your mineral collection, Sherman?

448
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,206
I'm sure she'll find
those new geodes

449
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,234
of yours fascinating.

450
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,328
Come on.

451
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:46,174
I am so glad you
accepted my invitation.

452
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:49,677
Now, the kids can resolve their
differences before Ms. Grunion arrives.

453
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,096
You're barking up the wrong
tree, mister. In fact...

454
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,515
if it weren't for Patty, I would
have pressed charges already.

455
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,975
And I have to tell you, Peabody...

456
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,560
where my daughter is concerned,

457
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,187
nothing is more important than...

458
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,057
Hello. Sure, I'll take a survey.

459
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,367
Everything going swimmingly?

460
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:13,868
Ugh.

461
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,454
Why didn't you tell me
she was coming over here?

462
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,706
Because I didn't want you to worry.

463
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,042
Okay, because I didn't want to
listen to your bellyaching.

464
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,670
Thank you for your honesty.

465
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:24,712
You're welcome.

466
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,548
I don't know what you think we're
supposed to do in here anyway.

467
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,133
She hates me.

468
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,344
Share your interests.
Tell a witty anecdote.

469
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,553
Mr. Peabody...

470
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,138
I hate her.

471
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,182
Sherman,
every great relationship...

472
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,684
starts from a place of conflict,

473
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,462
and evolves into something richer.

474
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,556
Bonne chance.

475
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,054
Make it work.

476
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,310
But don't tell her about the WABAC.

477
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:54,151
Don't even think about it.

478
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,145
Ah.

479
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,091
Peabody, that was amazing!

480
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,093
Paul, wasn't that amazing?

481
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,469
I'm more into rock-'n'-roll.

482
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:20,852
I meant flamenco.

483
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,136
Bagpipes?

484
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:31,434
Uh, didgeridoo.

485
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,908
Sitar.

486
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,243
Steel drums.

487
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,453
Trombone.

488
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:39,912
Xylophone.

489
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,080
DJembe?

490
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,290
Calliope.

491
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,916
Oboe. Piccolo.

492
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,543
Tuba. Dobro.

493
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,878
Slide whistle. Yodeling.

494
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,087
Hurdy-gurdy. Ocarina.

495
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,464
Harmonium. Musical saw.

496
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,466
You know what?
This has been great...

497
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,718
but a complete waste of time.

498
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,471
Now, let's get Penny and go home!

499
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:57,638
Are you all right, Paul?

500
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,433
I'm... fine.

501
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:02,060
This happens whenever he's tense.

502
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,144
Paul, if I might...

503
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,437
Stay away from me, Peabody!

504
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,981
Just get back! I need traction.

505
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,151
You can trust me, Paul.
I'm a licensed chiropractor.

506
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:11,652
Ow! Huh.

507
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:22,148
Ooh...

508
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,650
Ah...

509
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,167
Peabody...

510
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,543
I feel great.

511
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,505
I... I really feel great!

512
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:33,159
Peabody, you're a miracle worker.

513
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,135
Ha-ha! Look at me!

514
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,083
I'm dancing!

515
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,015
You know, Penny...

516
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,643
Sigmund Freud says
if you don't like a person...

517
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:47,480
it's because they remind you of something
you don't like about yourself.

518
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,440
What do you know
about Sigmund Freud?

519
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,691
More than you think.

520
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,319
Sure. Just like you
know all that stuff...

521
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,031
about George Washington not really
cutting down the cherry tree.

522
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,366
Ugh. What a crock.

523
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,534
But it's true!

524
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,327
- How do you know?
- I just know!

525
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,870
- Did you read it in a book?
- No!

526
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,163
- See it in a movie?
- No!

527
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,289
Did your brainiac dad tell you?

528
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,457
No!

529
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,667
So, how do you know, Sherman?

530
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,043
How do you know?

531
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,294
He told me.

532
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,420
Who told you?

533
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,368
George Washington.

534
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,538
George Washington?

535
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,205
Yeah.

536
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,793
Ugh! Liar.

537
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,135
But don't tell her about the WABAC.

538
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,646
He calls it the "WABAC."

539
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,565
So, where have you gone in it?

540
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,192
Not "where," Penny, "when."

541
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,862
Okay, smart guy, when?

542
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:40,700
Oh, 1965,1776, 1620...

543
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:44,579
1492, 1215, 4.

544
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,706
- Can it go back to an hour ago?
- Why?

545
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:49,208
Because I could take it home,
pretend to be sick...

546
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,169
and not come to
this lame dinner party.

547
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,380
Ha-ha. Mr. Peabody says you
should never use the WABAC...

548
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,591
to travel to
a time when you existed.

549
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:57,717
How come?

550
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:58,759
There would be two of you.

551
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,761
Oh, yeah.

552
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,914
I guess the world's
not ready for that.

553
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,090
Wow.

554
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,898
Um, well, now that we've seen
it, maybe we should go back.

555
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:15,109
Are you kidding?
Where should we go first?

556
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,946
Mr. Peabody says I'm not allowed
to drive it till I'm older.

557
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,365
Do you do everything
Mr. Peabody says?

558
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,617
Yeah.

559
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,577
You know what that
makes you, Sherman.

560
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,579
An obedient son?

561
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,788
Nope.

562
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,486
A dog.

563
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:44,547
- Ooh!
- Nice control.

564
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,000
- Look at him go!
- Take it, Patty!

565
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:49,268
- Heads up, Paul!
- Whoa!

566
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,646
Here you go. Zing!

567
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,969
Oh, yeah.

568
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,154
- Oh!
- Hey, look at that.

569
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,148
This is fun!

570
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,030
This is a little homespun
concoction I like to call...

571
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,665
"Einstein on the Beach."

572
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,318
Yummy.

573
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,670
To the kids.

574
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,869
To the kids!

575
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,091
Mr. Peabody.

576
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,425
Sherman?

577
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,677
Can I talk to you a second?

578
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:23,928
Of course.

579
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,706
Excuse me.

580
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,602
I've really hit it off
with Penny's parents.

581
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,814
I think we can file this night
under "Unqualified Success."

582
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,692
Uh, I would hold off
filing it just yet.

583
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,194
What do you mean? Where's Penny?

584
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,280
Uh... Ancient Egypt.

585
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,657
You used the WABAC?

586
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,286
What's happening, big guy?
We're running low.

587
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:53,165
I'll be right there, Paul.

588
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,417
How could you do such a thing?

589
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:55,626
She called me a liar...

590
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,836
for saying George Washington

591
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,796
never cut down a cherry tree.

592
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,215
So, you took her
to see George Washington?

593
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,384
Yeah. She was into it.

594
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,052
Hey, Pea-buddy.

595
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,178
Hey.

596
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,221
Where's Penny?

597
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,848
- Playing hide-and-seek.
- Pooping.

598
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:11,092
- Pooping.
- Playing hide and seek.

599
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,550
- Well, which is it?
- Uh...

600
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,355
Hey, what's going on here?

601
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,190
Yeah. What's going on here?

602
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,650
- What have you done with Penny?
- Penny?

603
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,319
Penny? Penny!

604
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,487
- Oh, my gosh!
- Where's our daughter?

605
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,157
It's hard to say, Paul.

606
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:31,245
She could be here, or here,
or here, or here...

607
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,863
or here.

608
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,833
That will hold them.

609
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,251
I learned that trick from a swami

610
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,669
at the Begawan Giri in Ubud, Bali.

611
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,413
Let's go!

612
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:57,104
Ancient Egypt.
Land of the Pharaohs.

613
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,107
A beacon of progress
on the horizon of humanity...

614
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,944
but a cruel and barbarous
civilization just the same.

615
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,349
I just hope Penny isn't
suffering too badly.

616
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,378
I got it.

617
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,754
What are you doing here?

618
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:24,032
We have come to take you home.

619
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,592
Ugh! What's the Egyptian word
for "tattletale"?

620
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,763
But that's beside the point. Get
your clothes on, we're going home.

621
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,973
Who died and made you Pharaoh?

622
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,297
Now, bring on the mani-pedi.

623
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,270
See, Mr. Peabody? Impossible!

624
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,147
Indeed, but watch what happens...

625
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:43,802
when an immovable object
meets an irresistible force.

626
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,985
Penny...

627
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,279
come here, right now. Penny, come!

628
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,156
I'm not Penny anymore.

629
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:53,828
Now, I'm Princess Hatsheput,
precious flower of the Nile.

630
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,037
"Precious," perhaps,
but if you think

631
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,330
"we're going to leave you here...

632
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,666
you are most
definitely in "de-Nile."

633
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,502
I don't get it.

634
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:02,670
Now, come along.

635
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,368
Unhand her!

636
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,800
What's the matter, my sweet
little desert blossom?

637
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:10,177
Are these barbarians bothering you?

638
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,930
As a matter of fact, they are.

639
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,515
Bow, barbarians.

640
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,684
As you wish, Your Highness.

641
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,686
Who's that, Mr. Peabody?

642
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,272
That, Sherman, is
the living image ofAmun...

643
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:24,525
son of Akhenaten, lord of the 18th
Dynasty of the New Kingdom...

644
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:25,818
King Tutankhamun.

645
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,695
Otherwise known as "King Tut."

646
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:28,863
My boyfriend.

647
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,699
- King Tut is your boyfriend?
- Mmm-hmm.

648
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,201
Would you like me to have them
skinned, covered with honey...

649
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,900
and laid in a pit of fire ants?

650
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,789
You would do that for me?

651
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,042
Anything, my desert flower.
Consider it a wedding gift.

652
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,587
What? You can't marry this guy!

653
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:45,713
Why not?

654
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:48,674
Well, for one, his name
rhymes with "butt."

655
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,802
I don't care. I'm gonna have a
big, fat, Egyptian wedding.

656
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,221
Spoiler alert, King Tut dies young.

657
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,223
Are you sure you've
thought this through?

658
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,726
Oh, trust me, I've thought it through.
I'm getting everything.

659
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,853
The royal astronomers
have decreed...

660
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:03,856
the wedding must take
place tomorrow at dawn.

661
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:04,982
Who is he?

662
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,358
- He is Ay.
- He is you?

663
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,570
I am Ay. The Grand Vizier.

664
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,655
- Yeah, that's his name.
- Oh.

665
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,867
Oh, Grand Vizier, would you mind
telling the precious princess, here...

666
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,578
precisely what it means
to marry the young Pharaoh.

667
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:18,746
Gladly.

668
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:22,082
It means she will be bound
to him in eternity...

669
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,834
through the sacred ceremonies

670
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,087
of disembowelment
and mummification...

671
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,423
as described in the holy texts.

672
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,925
Um, hold up a second.

673
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,760
Can you walk me
through that, somebody?

674
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:36,013
What he means, Penny, is that
when I die they'll kill you, too.

675
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,849
And then they'll rip out your organs,
stuff them in canopic jars...

676
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,559
and then mummify whatever is left.

677
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,769
Okay, I'm seeing this now.

678
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,688
Thank you. I'm going to go with them.

679
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,900
There's no turning back now.

680
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,068
To the palace!

681
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:51,312
Let the wedding preparations begin!

682
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,697
Mr. Peabody! Sherman!

683
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,865
Do something!

684
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,033
Don't worry, Penny!

685
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,606
We'll save you!

686
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,699
Hey, wait! You can't just...

687
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,574
leave us here.

688
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:07,962
Mr. Peabody?

689
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,171
Yes, Sherman?

690
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,464
Can I hold your hand?

691
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,341
Of course you can.

692
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:14,969
Boy, your hand
is cold, Mr. Peabody.

693
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,872
- Sherman?
- Yeah?

694
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,374
That's not my hand.

695
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:27,147
That's disarming.

696
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:30,150
Now, to find a way out of here.

697
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,318
Yuck!

698
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,820
Look around, Sherman.

699
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,155
These tombs are lined
with hieroglyphics...

700
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,408
designed to assist
the pharaohs' souls

701
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,702
in their journey to the afterlife.

702
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:43,232
And they may assist us as well.

703
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,500
Oh, this depicts the god Anubis

704
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,752
sailing the boat of Ra
to the underworld.

705
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:52,381
It appears the boats of Ra
are the key to our escape.

706
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,675
We must find them in time
to stop the wedding.

707
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:57,386
Well, if you ask me, we should
let her marry that guy.

708
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:58,721
They deserve each other.

709
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,055
What's that, Sherman?

710
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,682
Tut? Give me a break.

711
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:05,060
Bald, wears a skirt, and makeup.

712
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,771
If I didn't know any better, Sherman,
I would say you were jealous.

713
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,732
Jealous? Of what?

714
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,692
Tut's affection
for Penny, of course.

715
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,360
You think I like Penny?

716
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,737
Mmm-hmm.

717
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,030
Give me a break!

718
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:20,868
It's not like I want to hold
her hand, or go to the park...

719
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:24,113
or watch her while
she's brushing her hair.

720
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,417
Or anything.

721
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:29,944
Hmm.

722
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,705
A-ha!

723
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,871
Quickly, Sherman.

724
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:42,306
Ah, ah, ah! Careful, Sherman.

725
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,016
It's a booby trap.

726
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,352
What's so funny?

727
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:48,130
You said "booby."

728
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,717
One wrong step and we're done for.

729
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,319
"The boat...

730
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,223
"of Ra sails straight...

731
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,406
"to day.

732
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:03,118
"Take the wrong boat...

733
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,578
man will pay."

734
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,121
All right, Sherman,
now it's your turn.

735
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,749
Do the puzzle exactly as I did.

736
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,875
Huh?

737
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,903
Think it through,
one step at a time.

738
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,966
The boat of Ra sails straight...

739
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,368
play.

740
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,178
Uh, I mean, "pay."

741
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,671
Oh, my.

742
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,384
Uh-Oh.

743
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,093
Run!

744
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,861
The boats of Ra!

745
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,947
One boat is the way out,
the other will send us...

746
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,699
plunging into darkness
and certain death.

747
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,200
What?

748
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,368
Sherman, get in the boat.

749
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:47,454
As soon as I move these blocks together,
it's going to move very fast.

750
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,664
Which boat, Mr. Peabody?

751
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:49,873
What?

752
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,626
Which boat is the "not-certain-
death-plunge" boat?

753
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,199
That one!

754
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,726
We did it, Sherman!

755
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:09,893
Sherman?

756
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,729
Mr. Peabody!

757
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,188
What are you doing over there?

758
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,808
I thought you pointed to this one!

759
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,062
Ahhh!

760
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,051
Sherman? Sherman?

761
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,920
Are you all right?

762
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,248
I'm good.

763
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,695
The sun god, Ra...

764
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:06,366
commands us to begin
the sacred ceremony!

765
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:20,214
Bring forth the blade
for the blood oath.

766
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:29,375
Where blade meets flesh
in this sacred rite...

767
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,060
we pay tribute...

768
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,634
to the sun god, Ra!

769
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,356
Wait!

770
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:40,067
Anubis!

771
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,401
The god of death!

772
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,737
The wedding must not continue.

773
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,781
Why, Anubis, why?

774
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:48,617
Plagues. Plagues!

775
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,953
If this marriage pact is sealed...

776
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:54,957
I will shower down upon the
land uncountable plagues.

777
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,625
Oy, again with the plagues!

778
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,794
Why did I ever move to Egypt?

779
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:02,089
But, Anubis, the sun
god, Ra, has decreed...

780
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,133
that this girl is to be
the boy-king's wife.

781
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,760
That's so funny.

782
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:10,138
I was talking to the sun god,
Ra, just the other day...

783
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,850
and he told me he changed his mind.

784
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:13,934
Really?

785
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:18,021
Old "Flip-Flop Ra," we call
him here in the underworld.

786
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:21,596
But it's too late. We've
already paid for the catering.

787
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:26,280
Too bad! You're going
to lose your deposit.

788
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:32,286
More smoke, Sherman. This
canine subterfuge is working.

789
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:33,620
Deliver the girl...

790
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,665
to the gates of the city,
and leave her there...

791
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,960
where the gods
will retrieve her forthwith.

792
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:44,131
Only in this manner may the plagues
upon this land be avoided.

793
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,534
The girl must go!

794
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:48,719
Ow!

795
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,637
Anubis has spoken!

796
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,973
Take this girl to the gates!

797
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,308
Ow.

798
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,190
Anubis, you sound unwell.

799
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,860
Well, I have been feeling
a little under the weather...

800
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,889
but I'm feeling much better now.

801
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,814
Thank you.

802
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,482
Phew! Huh?

803
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,544
Penny, Sherman, quickly.

804
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,712
Come on, Penny.

805
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:25,285
Sherman!

806
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,467
Ah!

807
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,220
Runaway bride!

808
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,168
Stop them, you fools!

809
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,210
Ah!

810
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:56,271
Penny, Sherman, climb aboard.

811
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,906
Whoo-hoo!

812
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,616
They're getting away!

813
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,284
Ah!

814
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,091
Whoa!

815
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,016
I got it.

816
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,611
Whoo-hoo! We made it.

817
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,613
- Where do we go next, Mr. Peabody?
- Home.

818
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,407
We've got to get back
to the dinner party...

819
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,450
before Penny's parents
realize she's missing.

820
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,953
We don't have to
mention the whole...

821
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,913
uh, King Tut wedding thing, right?

822
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,248
Certainly not.

823
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,083
Anyway, as far as I'm concerned,

824
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,960
they get married too
young in Ancient Egypt.

825
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:48,240
Or, perhaps,
I'm just some old "Giza."

826
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,008
Huh?

827
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,540
Warning.

828
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,929
WABAC power supply insufficient.

829
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,515
Charge now. Warning.

830
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,267
Uh, what's the matter, Mr. Peabody?

831
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:03,145
All this zipping about the cosmos
has drained our power supply.

832
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,564
We're going to have to
make an unscheduled stop.

833
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:06,773
As luck would have it...

834
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,268
we have just enough power to
make it to the Renaissance.

835
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:25,625
I can't even tell my left
brain from my right anymore!

836
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,794
How many times I got to
tell you, Mona Lisa?

837
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,837
Mona Lisa?

838
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:31,131
I can't paint the picture...

839
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:33,216
until you smile!

840
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,970
Leonardo, tell me one thing
I have to smile about.

841
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,889
The sunshine, the pasta.

842
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:42,893
All the things that make Italy such
a popular tourist destination!

843
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:45,854
But I have not seen any
of them, Leonardo!

844
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:49,555
Because I'm sitting here
all day on my abbondanza!

845
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,819
I don't think that means
"chair" in Italian.

846
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,156
Ah, Peabody, my old friend.

847
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,742
What a welcome interruption!

848
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:02,496
Believe you me, this
woman is making me nuts.

849
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,247
So, how you been?

850
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,208
Good to see you. What do you want?

851
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:08,126
We're in a desperate
hurry to get home,

852
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,045
but the WABAC needs a jump start...

853
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:12,464
and we thought, who better than

854
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:14,841
Leonardo da Vinci to
help us on our way?

855
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,385
Peabody, I would love to help you,

856
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:19,930
but you come at a very bad time.

857
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:23,183
I don't know what I'm going
to do with this crazy woman.

858
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,727
You see what I mean?

859
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,937
What seems to be the problem?

860
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,438
"What is the problem?"

861
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,191
I am halfway done with the
painting, she won't even smile.

862
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:34,471
Fine. I smile.

863
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:39,032
No! That's a fake smile!

864
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,534
Everybody knows that!

865
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,953
Why don't you make it a real smile?

866
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,579
Why don't you say something funny?

867
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,206
I paint the paintings.

868
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:48,208
I make the machines.

869
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:51,128
I don't tell the jokes!

870
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,880
Perhaps, I can be
of assistance. You see...

871
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,091
humor is not immune
to the laws of science.

872
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,009
Using algorithms,
we can extrapolate

873
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,928
what is universally
considered "funny"...

874
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:02,180
thus producing a formula that is

875
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,629
scientifically
certain to cause laughter.

876
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,636
Case in point, the pratfall.

877
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,686
Is everyone amused?

878
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,572
Hmm.

879
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,323
The data was so clear. Ooh!

880
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,783
Don't worry, Mr. Peabody.

881
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,201
- I got it!
- Sherman... Ahh!

882
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,775
Oh!

883
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,260
Hold that smile!

884
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,663
Hold it right there!
No move! No move!

885
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:53,190
Well, Leo, if my
calculations are correct...

886
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,984
this machine of ours should generate
enough centrifugal force...

887
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:57,360
to send us home.

888
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,946
I got one last piece
I gotta pound in place.

889
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:03,283
Sherman, why don't you fetch
the hammer for Mr. Da Vinci?

890
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:05,527
Okay, Mr. Peabody.

891
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,999
Mr. Peabody!

892
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,292
Well done, Sherman.

893
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:13,460
But, Mr. Peabody!

894
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,204
Very helpful.

895
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,882
Sherman!

896
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,880
Yes, Mr. Peabody?

897
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:34,806
The hammer.

898
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,191
Da Vinci.

899
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:39,015
Oh. Okay, Mr. Peabody.

900
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,060
Oh!

901
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,074
- Here you go, Mr. Da Vinci.
- Ahh!

902
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,325
Do you need any help?

903
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:47,327
No, no. That's quite all right.

904
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,230
Thank you.

905
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,981
Psst! Sherman.

906
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,738
- Huh?
- Let's go. Let's go explore.

907
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,169
Uh, well, I'm supposed to be having

908
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,380
father-son time with Mr. Peabody.

909
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,215
Wouldn't you rather
have fun with me?

910
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:01,591
Uh...

911
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,717
Okay.

912
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:03,927
Sherman...

913
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,178
where are you going?

914
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,429
Exploring.

915
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,722
But we need your help.

916
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,392
No, we don't!
I mean, we can manage.

917
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:11,919
Somehow.

918
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,561
He's a boy, Peabody.

919
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:16,356
Let him have his fun. Let him go.

920
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:18,430
Thanks, Mr. Peabody!

921
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,905
He's growing up, Peabody.

922
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:27,200
Like a baby bird leaving the nest.

923
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,945
Isn't it wonderful?

924
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,117
It's like a museum.

925
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,450
It's like a toy store.

926
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,960
Wow.

927
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,727
Check this out.

928
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:56,396
It's the world's
biggest model airplane.

929
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:59,232
It's not a model, Penny.
It's a prototype.

930
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,360
And we should probably
just leave that alone.

931
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,403
Okay.

932
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:05,655
But wouldn't it be cool
if we could fly it?

933
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,824
I don't think
Mr. Peabody would like that.

934
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,076
Well, Mr. Peabody isn't here.

935
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,786
Just tell me how it works.

936
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,246
Please?

937
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,581
For learning.

938
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,700
Oh. Okay.

939
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:20,420
The thrust comes from this kind
of crossbow doohickey here.

940
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:24,591
Then it shoots along the track
until the wind catches the wings.

941
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,509
- But how does it go?
- Huh?

942
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,094
How do you take off?

943
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,589
Oh, you just pull down that lever.

944
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:32,849
This one?

945
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,059
Oh, boy.

946
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,007
Ah!

947
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:41,471
Wow! Whoo-hoo!

948
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,444
This is crazy!

949
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:46,863
No, it's not Sherman. It's fun!

950
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,323
We're gonna die!

951
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:51,242
Oh, stop being such a party
pooper and enjoy it!

952
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:57,791
Ah...

953
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,794
Nothing is as beautiful
as an elegant equation...

954
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:03,630
translated into
perfect engineering.

955
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,799
Why can't children be so simple?

956
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,968
Because children
are not machines, Peabody.

957
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:12,347
Believe me, I tried to build one.

958
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:14,876
Oh! It was creepy.

959
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,686
Here, Sherman! You fly it!

960
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,146
But I don't want to fly!

961
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:22,148
Sure you do. It'll be fun!

962
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,901
No, seriously, Penny,
I don't want to!

963
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,820
I'm letting go. One...

964
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:27,987
Don't let go!

965
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,072
Two...

966
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:30,824
- No!
- Three!

967
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:35,400
Penny, fly the plane!

968
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:36,746
No, Sherman!

969
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,997
You're going to have to save us!

970
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,445
But I can't do it!

971
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,585
I'm serious, Penny.
I don't know how to fly!

972
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,504
You can do it! I know you can!

973
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:45,713
Come on, Sherman.

974
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,115
Fly!

975
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:55,140
Ah!

976
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:01,847
Phew!

977
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,034
See? You got this, Sherman.

978
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:18,154
You're right. I have got this.

979
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,607
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

980
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,964
Da Vinci's at it again!

981
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,716
You ever see that child he made?

982
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,217
So creepy.

983
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,165
Papa. Mama.

984
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,839
Papa. Mama.

985
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,000
All done up here, Leonardo.

986
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,336
And I am all done down here.

987
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,254
It is beautiful, isn't it?

988
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:12,592
Every piece in its place doing
precisely what it's supposed to do.

989
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,177
Look, Peabody!

990
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:16,262
It's my flying mach...

991
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,847
MY flying machine?

992
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:18,932
Sherman.

993
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,099
Sherman?

994
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,519
Sherman, what are
you doing up there?

995
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,103
I'm flying!

996
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:26,814
But, Sherman,
you don't know how to fly!

997
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:27,941
I don't?

998
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:29,108
No!

999
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,616
Turn!

1000
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:37,700
Turn, Sherman!

1001
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,229
Lean!

1002
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,533
Oh, no!

1003
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,967
Sherman?

1004
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,344
Sherman! Are you okay?

1005
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:59,419
That was pretty fantastic!

1006
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,759
Oh! I can't believe it!

1007
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,937
My flying machine! It's work!

1008
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:10,316
Sherman! You are the
first flying man!

1009
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,360
Oh, you should be
very proud, Peabody.

1010
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:14,195
Very. Very proud!

1011
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,724
"Proud" doesn't
begin to describe it.

1012
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:21,061
Leonardo, will you please
fire up the mechanism?

1013
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:43,099
Papa. Mama.

1014
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,298
Mona!

1015
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,604
Papa. Mama.

1016
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:49,006
The kid!

1017
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,884
I'm sorry I broke
the plane, Mr. Peabody.

1018
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,595
Well, you should be.
You could have been killed.

1019
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:22,096
What are you talking about?

1020
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,932
Sherman flew a plane.
He was amazing!

1021
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:28,519
Sherman destroyed a priceless
historical artifact.

1022
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,855
Whatever. You should be happy.

1023
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,566
It turns out Sherman is not a
complete and total loser, after all.

1024
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:34,859
Yeah, Mr. Peabody.

1025
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,934
It turns out I'm not a complete
and total loser, after all.

1026
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,406
Ms. Peterson...

1027
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,076
stop turning my son
into a hooligan.

1028
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:44,535
It's not my fault he's a hooligan.

1029
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:47,205
Yeah, it's not her
fault I'm a hooligan.

1030
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:48,748
Well, it's certainly not my fault!

1031
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:50,291
I've spent the last seven years

1032
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,876
teaching Sherman good judgment.

1033
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,002
If you're such a great parent...

1034
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,997
why is Ms. Grunion trying to
take Sherman away from you?

1035
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:00,301
Is that true?

1036
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,553
Is someone gonna
take me away from you?

1037
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:05,056
No, Sherman,
I'll never let that happen.

1038
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:06,808
You just need to trust me.

1039
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:09,553
Oh, dear, a black hole!

1040
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,401
What's happening?

1041
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:17,819
If I can't pull us out of here...

1042
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:21,190
we're going to be smashed to
smithereens on the event horizon.

1043
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,988
There's not enough power to
resist the gravitational pull!

1044
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:31,749
I've got to divert everything
to the reverse thrusters.

1045
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,917
Why didn't you tell me?

1046
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,001
Tell you what?

1047
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,628
Why didn't you tell me Ms. Grunion

1048
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,380
was trying to take
me away from you?

1049
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:39,298
It's not your job to
worry about these things.

1050
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,008
You just didn't
think I could handle it.

1051
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,261
We'll discuss it later.
Now, sit down.

1052
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:45,304
I don't want to discuss it later!

1053
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,806
Sherman, sit!

1054
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:48,891
You can't talk to me like that.

1055
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,309
I'm not a dog.

1056
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,686
What did you say?

1057
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:54,510
I said, I'm not a dog!

1058
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,941
You're right, Sherman, you're not.

1059
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,640
You're just a very bad boy!

1060
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,779
T-minus 10...

1061
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,823
Nine, eight...

1062
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:04,991
Seven...

1063
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:06,033
Six...

1064
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,326
Five...

1065
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,525
Four, three...

1066
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:10,830
Two...

1067
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:12,153
One.

1068
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,880
Sherman?

1069
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,340
Penny?

1070
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:31,501
Sherman, are you okay?

1071
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:36,306
Sherman?

1072
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:45,156
He's gone.

1073
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:47,434
Where are we, anyway?

1074
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,111
Oh, no.

1075
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,573
We're on the brink of one of history's
most ferocious conflicts...

1076
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:10,674
Delivery.

1077
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,525
How are we doing, heroes of Greece?

1078
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:21,943
Feeling good?

1079
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,861
Feeling strong?

1080
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,697
Okay, let's get warmed up!

1081
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,533
We don't want to pull
something out there.

1082
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:30,535
Remember what happened to Achilles.

1083
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:32,904
That whole thing with his heel.

1084
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,791
Looking good, Diomedes.

1085
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:38,793
Menelaus, my man!

1086
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:40,169
My man.

1087
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,588
Are you ready to get on
the field, Shermanus?

1088
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,924
Sure thing, Mr. Agamemnon.

1089
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,260
That's cute.

1090
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,838
Shh.

1091
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:55,753
Odysseus, what news do you bring?

1092
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,812
Someone left this for us.

1093
00:55:57,813 --> 00:55:59,230
A present. Nice.

1094
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,884
It looks just like our horse.

1095
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,766
Should I bring it inside?

1096
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,480
It would be rude not to.

1097
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,695
I did not see that coming!

1098
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:18,332
Ugh! Jeez Louise,
what is that smell?

1099
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,293
Oh!

1100
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,461
Ooh. That is the smell of victory.

1101
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,922
Yeah! Victory!

1102
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:27,842
Greetings, men of
Athens, Sparta and Thebes.

1103
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:29,260
Peabody, here.

1104
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:31,012
I've come for Sherman.

1105
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:33,014
- Do you know this guy?
- I thought I did...

1106
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:34,640
but now I'm not so sure.

1107
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,934
Then he must be a spy. Kill him!

1108
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,258
No! No!

1109
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,981
He's my dad.

1110
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:43,399
- Your dad?
- Huh?

1111
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,848
It's an adoptive relationship.

1112
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:47,737
Aw!

1113
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,865
Thank you for taking such good
care of my son, Agamemnon...

1114
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:53,409
but it's time for him to come home.

1115
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,245
Sorry, Mr. Peabody,
I've joined the Greek army.

1116
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,705
Shermanus is one of us now.

1117
00:56:57,706 --> 00:56:58,998
- He's a brother.
- I'm his brother.

1118
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,082
He's my son.

1119
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,500
- He took an oath.
- I took an oath.

1120
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:02,618
He's seven!

1121
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,629
And a half!

1122
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:08,174
All sons must prove
themselves to their fathers.

1123
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,133
Today...

1124
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:13,596
Shermanus will prove himself
on the field of battle.

1125
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:14,597
But he's only a child.

1126
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:17,808
Your dad may not think you're ready
to become a man, Shermanus...

1127
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,018
but we do.

1128
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,061
Yeah!

1129
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:21,187
Yeah, Mr. Peabody.

1130
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,147
Now, I'll show you
what I can handle.

1131
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,650
FYI, a lot of heroes
have father issues.

1132
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:27,234
My old man is a minotaur.

1133
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:30,529
Half man, half bull, all judgment.

1134
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,823
Ajax, here, strongest
guy in the world...

1135
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:36,535
but his father never accepted
that his real dream was to sing.

1136
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:38,454
I wanted to be in the Greek chorus.

1137
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,665
Uh, yeah, and don't even get
me started about Oedipus.

1138
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:42,625
Let's just say that you do not want

1139
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:44,627
to be at his house
over the holidays.

1140
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,245
It's awkward.

1141
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,297
Sherman, I'm concerned you
haven't thought this through.

1142
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,842
This is war. Do you realize
what's about to happen?

1143
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,469
I'll tell you what's gonna happen.

1144
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,846
We're gonna destroy their houses!

1145
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,348
Pull down their temples!

1146
00:57:57,349 --> 00:58:00,726
And make the streets
of the city run red...

1147
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,728
with Trojan blood!

1148
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,221
Yeah!

1149
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:08,852
Blood! Blood! Blood!

1150
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,453
Zeus on three! One!

1151
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:22,289
Sherman, I absolutely forbid you
to fight in the Trojan War.

1152
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:25,251
It's not fair! All my friends
are fighting in the Trojan War.

1153
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:27,003
- Two!
- Sherman, it's dangerous.

1154
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,212
I'm wearing a helmet.

1155
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,714
- Three!
- You're not going!

1156
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:30,881
Oh, yes, I am.

1157
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:33,000
Zeus!

1158
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:35,428
Zeus! Zeus!

1159
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:41,502
Eat my bronze, you Trojan dogs!

1160
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:45,673
Eat my bronze, you Trojan dog!

1161
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,183
Ahh!

1162
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:00,570
Well, that's cutting it close.

1163
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:05,150
This is why I ask you
to obey me, Sherman.

1164
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:10,406
Because I'm your father, and
it's my job to keep you safe.

1165
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:14,668
But are you sure Ms. Grunion
won't take me away?

1166
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:18,288
Not as long as I'm around.

1167
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,400
Mr. Peabody!

1168
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,303
Help me!

1169
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:35,138
Penny!

1170
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,246
Smell my victory!

1171
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,873
Smell it!

1172
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:48,652
Hey! That's my ride!

1173
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:56,175
Mr. Peabody...

1174
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:57,828
hurry!

1175
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:01,714
I'll take that.

1176
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,188
You did it, Sherman!

1177
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,439
Mr. Peabody helped.

1178
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,108
Now, let's get to
the WABAC, go home,

1179
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:55,860
un-hypnotize Penny's parents...

1180
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:57,236
finish that dinner party,
eat my Baked Alaska...

1181
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:58,612
charm the pants off Ms. Grunion...

1182
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:01,115
and make sure none of this ever
happens in the first place.

1183
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:03,075
Sounds good.

1184
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,410
I'm in.

1185
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:05,983
Ah!

1186
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,277
Sherman!

1187
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:11,659
- Penny!
- Sherman, no!

1188
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,500
Whoa!

1189
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,967
Mr. Peabody...

1190
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,674
Mr. Peabody?

1191
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,385
Mr. Peabody!

1192
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:41,060
Mr. Peabody!

1193
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,062
Dad!

1194
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:58,456
Oh, Mr. Peabody! What should
I do? What should I do?

1195
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:04,162
There's nothing
you can do, Sherman.

1196
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,250
I just want to go home.

1197
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,587
Home.

1198
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,215
That's it.

1199
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:17,358
I got an idea.

1200
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,306
Come on!

1201
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:21,946
Where are we gonna go?

1202
01:02:21,947 --> 01:02:23,280
We're going home.

1203
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,366
There's only one person
who can help us...

1204
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:27,076
and that's Mr. Peabody.

1205
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:29,828
What are you talking about?
How is that even possible?

1206
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,247
We've got a time machine, Penny!

1207
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:33,165
I can set it so that we'll get home

1208
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,376
when Mr. Peabody is still there.

1209
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:36,752
But I thought you're not supposed

1210
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,128
to go back to a time
when you existed.

1211
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:40,031
What choice do we have?

1212
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:44,927
Error. You are attempting to
travel to an era in which you exist.

1213
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:46,921
This could alter
the fabric of space-time.

1214
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:51,433
Error. Error.

1215
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,336
Hang on!

1216
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,679
This is fun!

1217
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:08,856
This is a little homespun
concoction I like to call...

1218
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,203
"Einstein on the Beach."

1219
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,947
Yummy.

1220
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:16,125
To the kids.

1221
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:18,324
To the kids!

1222
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:20,504
Mr. Peabody.

1223
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:22,089
Sherman? Penny?

1224
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,590
Can we talk to you a second?

1225
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:24,550
Of course.

1226
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:26,248
Excuse me.

1227
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,597
I've really hit it off
with your parents.

1228
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:33,934
I think we can file this night
under "Unqualified Success."

1229
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:36,520
I'd hold off filing it just yet.

1230
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,479
What do you mean?

1231
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,982
Why are you two dressed
like ancient Greeks?

1232
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:41,650
- You used the WABAC!
- I did.

1233
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,444
I know, it's terrible!

1234
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:44,486
But why?

1235
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,697
Penny and I got into an argument
about George Washington.

1236
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:48,115
So, I made him show me the WABAC.

1237
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:49,408
And I lost her in ancient Egypt.

1238
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:50,784
And I got engaged to King Tut.

1239
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:52,619
- So, I came back and got you.
- Then we ran out of gas.

1240
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,413
- In Florence.
- Went into a black hole.

1241
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:56,165
And then you died in ancient Troy.

1242
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,584
Died? I have a hard
time believing that.

1243
01:03:58,585 --> 01:03:59,585
It's true!

1244
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:02,212
But now you're here, and
everything's gonna be okay.

1245
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,381
I told you never to come back
to a time when you existed...

1246
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,924
because there would be two of you!

1247
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:08,635
Yeah, but the other one
of me is in ancient Egypt.

1248
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:13,390
Ahh!

1249
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,558
Who are you?

1250
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,393
He's you, but
from another timeline.

1251
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:19,646
But I thought you said never to come
back to a time when you existed.

1252
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:21,720
- Exactly!
- I know.

1253
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:25,736
But what was I supposed to do?
Mr. Peabody died in ancient Troy.

1254
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:26,653
Died?

1255
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:28,364
I have a hard time believing that.

1256
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:29,490
Thank you.

1257
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:31,075
What are we going to do?

1258
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:33,410
Well, for starters, both
Shermans can't stay here.

1259
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:34,912
Why? We could get bunk beds.

1260
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:36,121
I was thinking the same thing.

1261
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,831
That's so weird.
It's like we're twins!

1262
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,233
I was thinking that, too!

1263
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,417
Ow!

1264
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:43,462
You see? We can't have two
Shermans in the same timeline.

1265
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:47,049
It puts too much strain
on the space-time continuum.

1266
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:48,967
What to do? The Petersons

1267
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,511
can't know any of this.

1268
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:52,334
Hey, Pea-buddy.

1269
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:53,764
Hey.

1270
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:54,932
How's it going?

1271
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:57,927
Patty and I are
working up an appetite.

1272
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:00,270
Mmm. The smells coming from
your kitchen are yummy!

1273
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:02,799
Especially that Baked Alaska.

1274
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:04,525
So, what's going on here?

1275
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:06,269
Yeah, what's with the getups?

1276
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,903
Toga party!

1277
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,738
Toga party?

1278
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:13,283
Yes, it is a toga party!

1279
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:14,701
Well, what about dinner?

1280
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:15,828
I'm starving.

1281
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:17,162
Why don't we head into
the dining room...

1282
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,248
and tuck into those quails
you've been yakking about?

1283
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:20,332
- No!
- Why not?

1284
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:24,461
Because it's so fun right here!

1285
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:27,490
Whoo-hoo!

1286
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:35,222
Ms. Grunion!

1287
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:37,099
How delightful.

1288
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,934
We were having such a good time...

1289
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,352
- I almost forgot you were coming.
- Oh!

1290
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:42,146
Well, why don't you join the party?

1291
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:45,899
I'm not here for a party. I'm
here for the investigation.

1292
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:49,319
Good. Why don't you start
investigating over here?

1293
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,448
Or here, or here, or here...

1294
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:54,442
Stop waving your hands around!

1295
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:57,953
Sherman?

1296
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,872
Wait! Is that...?

1297
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,582
Sherman!

1298
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:04,877
Dos Shermanos? What's
going on here, Peabody?

1299
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:07,337
Oh...

1300
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:08,589
Um...

1301
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:09,923
Nobody move!

1302
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:13,469
Sherman, I've got to get you out
of here before you touch yourself.

1303
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:17,473
Mr. Peabody! You didn't die!

1304
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,099
Of course I didn't die.

1305
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,392
Thank you.

1306
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,436
Hey. How did you get back?

1307
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:24,229
Well, after a few
failed experiments...

1308
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:26,607
I hit upon a combination of
bones, stone and yak fat...

1309
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:28,775
and constructed
a rudimentary WABAC.

1310
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:29,902
You know what they say...

1311
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:33,280
"if at first you don't
succeed, Troy, Troy again."

1312
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:36,116
This is no time for puns!
Even good ones.

1313
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,826
Penny, Sherman, quickly!

1314
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,786
You're not going anywhere.

1315
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:42,206
I've seen quite enough
to remove the boy...

1316
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:44,791
both boys, from this home.

1317
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,836
No, don't, Ms. Grunion, please!

1318
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:51,366
This is all my fault. I started it.

1319
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:54,084
I'm so sorry, Sherman.

1320
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:57,721
You have nothing
to apologize for, Penny.

1321
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:59,515
A dog should never
have been allowed

1322
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:01,350
to adopt a boy in the first place.

1323
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:02,643
Now, come along.

1324
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,512
Ms. Grunion, be careful!

1325
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:06,480
Ah! Oh!

1326
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:07,723
What's happening?

1327
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,655
Mr. Peabody, help!

1328
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,228
- Sherman!
- Sherman!

1329
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:21,855
Oh!

1330
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:31,869
Hey! Where did the other two go?

1331
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:36,427
Our cosmic doubles combined in
order to reconcile a paradox...

1332
01:07:36,428 --> 01:07:39,421
in the space-time continuum.

1333
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:41,332
Okay, that makes sense.

1334
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:43,517
I don't know what
just happened here...

1335
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:46,395
but I know it was wrong!

1336
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:48,514
- This boy is coming with me!
- Mr. Peabody!

1337
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:49,940
- No, Ms. Grunion!
- Ow! Let me go!

1338
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:51,058
Get back here!

1339
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,761
Ow! Ow! You're hurting me!

1340
01:07:56,364 --> 01:07:58,186
Oh! Oh!

1341
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:03,905
He bit me!

1342
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:07,149
He bit me!

1343
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,043
Yes, hello, police.

1344
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:12,129
I'd like to report an assault.

1345
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,297
A bite.

1346
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:15,549
Mr. Peabody, what are we gonna do?

1347
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:17,134
Get here as soon as possible.

1348
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:18,331
Run!

1349
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:21,122
He's kidnapping the children! Oh!

1350
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:25,684
I can't believe you
bit her, Mr. Peabody!

1351
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:27,603
I know, Sherman, it was wrong.

1352
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:28,478
"Wrong"?

1353
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,552
It was awesome!

1354
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:34,139
And now, to return to our proper
timeline and erase this mess.

1355
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:41,559
There he is! He's got my daughter
in that giant space apple!

1356
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:50,617
My face is numb.

1357
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:53,920
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yes!

1358
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:56,703
What's wrong?

1359
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,622
Time travel failed.

1360
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:03,876
Oh, dear.

1361
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,183
What is it, Mr. Peabody?

1362
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:07,309
Our cosmic doubles colliding...

1363
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:09,337
ripped a hole
in the space-time continuum.

1364
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:11,563
That's why we didn't
get to the past.

1365
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:16,777
Hey, Peabody!

1366
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:19,146
Looks like the past
is coming to us.

1367
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:23,230
Oof! I will get you, dog!

1368
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:25,077
And your little boy, too!

1369
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:28,747
Penny!

1370
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:30,149
My bride!

1371
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:34,908
What?

1372
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:39,959
Oh, dear.

1373
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:49,961
Follow that orb!

1374
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:04,684
Incoming!

1375
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:09,955
What sort of creature are you?

1376
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:13,200
The name is Grunion!

1377
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:17,121
I'm in love!

1378
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:22,080
I just need to find a wormhole.

1379
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:30,976
Hey, Einstein, it's a red light.

1380
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:33,254
Hey, I'm walking, here!

1381
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:35,564
Cake!

1382
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:37,512
Mmm!

1383
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:42,976
There they go. Don't lose them.

1384
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:50,370
I'm trying to find
another wormhole...

1385
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:51,413
but they all lead
back to the present!

1386
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:53,066
Time travel failed.

1387
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:55,234
Time travel failed.

1388
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:01,882
Whoo!

1389
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:04,134
There he is. After them!

1390
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:07,209
Penny, my queen,
I know you're in there.

1391
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:10,253
We're coming, Shermanus!

1392
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:15,020
Time travel failed.

1393
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,062
Mr. Peabody!

1394
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,589
Look out!

1395
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,097
Whoa!

1396
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,074
Shermanus, hold on.

1397
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:30,202
We shall release you from this egg.

1398
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:36,082
Drop the saber and step away
from the futuristic orb.

1399
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:38,335
I take orders from no man!

1400
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:48,459
Don't tase me, bro.

1401
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:51,003
Come out, Peabody, with
your paws in the air.

1402
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,143
Mr. Peabody, you're under arrest...

1403
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:57,437
for kidnapping, reckless
endangerment...

1404
01:11:57,438 --> 01:12:00,899
And a multiplicity of
major traffic violations.

1405
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:01,942
You don't understand.

1406
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:04,402
There's a rip
in the space-time continuum!

1407
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,530
If you arrest me,
I won't be able to fix...

1408
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:08,698
Blah, blah, blah. For too long...

1409
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:11,743
you've bamboozled the world
with your fancy jargon...

1410
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:13,078
and that little red tie of yours...

1411
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,579
and look what's come of it.

1412
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,664
Take him away!

1413
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:16,706
Wait.

1414
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:18,875
Mr. Peabody!

1415
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:20,277
Sherman!

1416
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,964
What's gonna happen to Mr. Peabody?

1417
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:27,092
Don't you know what
happens to dogs that bite?

1418
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:28,760
Let me go.

1419
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,178
You don't know what you're doing.

1420
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,305
Please, before it's too late.

1421
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:34,174
Wait!

1422
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:35,934
Give him another chance.

1423
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:39,980
He's through with chances. Now,
he has to pay for his mistakes.

1424
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:41,815
But I'm the one who
made all the mistakes.

1425
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:44,734
I'm the one who used the
WABAC without permission.

1426
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:48,014
The only mistake
Mr. Peabody ever made...

1427
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:50,353
was me.

1428
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:52,935
Sherman.

1429
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:55,453
You're absolutely right, Sherman.

1430
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:59,984
What kind of a father could
this dog ever be to a boy?

1431
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:04,337
Maybe you're right, Ms. Grunion.

1432
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:06,715
But there's one thing
you haven't considered.

1433
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,208
What's that?

1434
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:11,745
I'm a dog, too!

1435
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:16,141
If being a dog means
you're like Mr. Peabody...

1436
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:18,101
who never turns his back on you...

1437
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:21,146
and who's always there to
pick you up when you fall...

1438
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:25,442
and loves you no matter how
many times you mess up...

1439
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:27,903
if that's what it
means to be a dog...

1440
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:31,524
then, yeah, I'm a dog, too!

1441
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:35,311
I'm a dog, too.

1442
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:38,079
I'm a dog, too.

1443
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,041
I'm a dog, too!

1444
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:42,667
I'm a dog as well!

1445
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,085
A poodle dog!

1446
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:46,171
I am a dog, too.

1447
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:47,839
Ditto on that dog thing!

1448
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,746
I'm a dog, too.

1449
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:54,179
I am a dog as well.

1450
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,430
I'm a dog, too.

1451
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,957
I'm a dog, too.

1452
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:07,927
I'm a dog, too.

1453
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:17,187
I'm Spartacus!

1454
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:21,331
All right, fine, you're all dogs,
but you can't change the law.

1455
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:23,609
I know someone who can.

1456
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,287
George Washington.

1457
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:31,633
We hold these truths
to be self-evident...

1458
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:37,597
that all men, and some
dogs, are created equal.

1459
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:42,519
I hereby award Mr. Peabody
a presidential pardon.

1460
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,770
Me, too.

1461
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:45,271
I've done worse.

1462
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:55,479
Huh?

1463
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:01,196
Uh, Mr. Peabody, look!

1464
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:08,241
Ahh!

1465
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:10,914
Ooh!

1466
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:15,427
It's getting closer!

1467
01:15:15,428 --> 01:15:17,095
What are we going to do?

1468
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:19,431
This is the greatest collection
of geniuses ever assembled!

1469
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:22,711
Surely we can come up with another
way of getting to the past.

1470
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:24,269
I can build a catapult.

1471
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,895
We go very fast.

1472
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:29,149
But, remember, as you approach
the speed of light...

1473
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:31,443
gravity will get too strong.

1474
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:34,946
Oh, indeed. "For every action, there
is an equal and opposite reaction."

1475
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:38,783
How about we just punch
that big hole in the face?

1476
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:49,419
I have an idea.

1477
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:52,547
Hey, everybody, I have an idea!

1478
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,074
Yes, what is it, Sherman?

1479
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:57,161
Why not go to the future?

1480
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:58,428
The future?

1481
01:15:58,429 --> 01:16:03,209
I've never been there before, so
it's probably not as messed up.

1482
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:05,226
Sherman, that's it!

1483
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:07,145
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

1484
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:08,521
Not usually.

1485
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:11,220
It's exactly what
you all just said...

1486
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:13,635
except the total opposite!

1487
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,530
If we set the WABAC for the
future, and go very, very fast...

1488
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:19,908
we'll create our own
gravitational field...

1489
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,868
that's equal and opposite...

1490
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:25,569
to the rip in
the space-time continuum!

1491
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,249
Oh, my...

1492
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:29,793
I don't get it.

1493
01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:33,789
We're gonna fly up there and
punch that big hole in the face!

1494
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:34,994
Yes!

1495
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:39,874
Sherman, you're a genius.

1496
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,180
But, Peabody...

1497
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:45,058
how far into the future must you go?

1498
01:16:45,059 --> 01:16:46,976
Just a few seconds ought to do it,

1499
01:16:46,977 --> 01:16:48,895
and then we'll
slingshot right back.

1500
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:50,939
Are you sure this is going to work?

1501
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,808
Don't worry, Penny.

1502
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:55,060
Just remember, I'm a...

1503
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:57,847
genius!

1504
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:58,822
Sherman...

1505
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:00,824
I need to reprogram the WABAC.

1506
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:02,075
All right, Mr. Peabody.

1507
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:04,524
That means you have to drive.

1508
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:35,066
In order to make the leap
into the future...

1509
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:37,026
the WABAC will
have to go very fast.

1510
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:39,225
Faster than it's ever gone before!

1511
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:42,312
Are you ready, Sherman?

1512
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:43,730
I'm ready.

1513
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:50,065
Come on, Sherman, you can do it.

1514
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,260
Now, Mr. Peabody?

1515
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:04,413
Sherman, we need more speed.

1516
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:08,641
Now?

1517
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:10,518
Just a little more!

1518
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:14,397
Not yet, Sherman.

1519
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:15,674
Not yet.

1520
01:18:16,483 --> 01:18:17,679
Now!

1521
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:54,755
Whoa! Whoa!

1522
01:18:54,772 --> 01:18:56,481
Farewell!

1523
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:05,823
Ooh!

1524
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:08,243
You haven't seen the
last of me, Peabody.

1525
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:11,621
You'll make a mistake
eventually, and when you do...

1526
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:13,957
I'll be there!

1527
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:15,667
- The Grunion is mine!
- Ooh!

1528
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:39,842
Come on, Sherman. Come on!

1529
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:04,450
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

1530
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:31,075
If you want to watch television
before I get home...

1531
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:33,244
simply press "input" three times...

1532
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:34,620
and then use the remote
control as usual.

1533
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:35,788
Yes, Sherman.

1534
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:38,291
And if you're worried about making
friends at the PTA meeting...

1535
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:40,043
consider bringing
snacks for everyone.

1536
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:41,878
Bagels are always appreciated.

1537
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:43,622
Yes, Sherman.

1538
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:46,090
And remember, Mr. Peabody...

1539
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:49,415
I have robotics club
after school today.

1540
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,721
Sherman, wait.

1541
01:20:51,722 --> 01:20:53,874
Yes, Mr. Peabody?

1542
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,922
I...

1543
01:20:57,895 --> 01:21:00,548
I love you, Sherman.

1544
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:07,517
I have a deep regard for
you as well, Mr. Peabody.

1545
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:20,041
Hey, Mr. Peabody!

1546
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:21,292
Hey, Sherman!

1547
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:22,910
Wait up!

1548
01:21:25,422 --> 01:21:27,006
No doubt about it.

1549
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:29,910
Every dog should have a boy.

1550
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:52,941
Oh!

1551
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:57,912
Ooh!

1552
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,065
Ah!

1553
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:03,952
A-ha!

1554
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:21,060
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1555
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:23,680
You may kiss the Grunion.

1556
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:27,225
Come here, soldier.

1557
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:44,739
There's always time for living

1558
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:48,113
Can we just do it again?

1559
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:55,129
One more time like it
once was way back when

1560
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:59,379
You gave me something to believe in

1561
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:03,003
We were the best of friends

1562
01:23:03,896 --> 01:23:09,928
Well, I remember the
good times way back when

1563
01:23:16,366 --> 01:23:21,397
Memories will fade if you
wanted me to let you go

1564
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:28,085
I've got you on your way I feel
it for you, don't you know

1565
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:31,114
We're superheroes and villains

1566
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:34,417
When we used to pretend

1567
01:23:35,093 --> 01:23:41,591
We'd go wherever our minds
would take us way back when

1568
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:50,509
Memories will fade if you
wanted me to let you go

1569
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:57,854
I've got you on your way I feel
it for you, don't you know

1570
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:05,281
It's a promise that I made
Never be afraid

1571
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:12,872
I know we'll be okay This
luck we have, it cannot go

1572
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:15,993
'Cause you're on your own

1573
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:19,879
You're not alone

1574
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:26,838
I know I'll see you again Again

1575
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:31,133
And if all these things

1576
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:34,849
Come to an end

1577
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:40,396
We'll always have a way back when

1578
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:51,490
Memories will fade if you
wanted me to let you go

1579
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:59,085
I've got you on your way I feel
it for you, don't you know

1580
01:25:01,555 --> 01:25:05,960
It's a promise that I made
Never be afraid

1581
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:14,309
I know we'll be okay, this
luck we have, it cannot go
