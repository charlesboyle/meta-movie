00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,364
- (man) Easy!
- (woman) Excuse me!

5
00:02:40,756 --> 00:02:42,049
Good morning. Jackson Steinem.

6
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,469
- How you doing, Buddy?
- Great, Carolyn.

7
00:02:45,553 --> 00:02:48,055
Doing any better would be a sin.

8
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:52,518
Morning.

9
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:02,403
Morning, Dan. What's looking good today?

10
00:03:02,486 --> 00:03:06,157
lf l knew, l wouldn't be in this business.
Get out while you're young.

11
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,493
l came here one day, l sat down,
and look at me now.

12
00:03:09,577 --> 00:03:11,662
Look at you now.

13
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:15,708
Morning, Brian.

14
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:19,587
- Chuckie! How's the woman slayer?
- Looking for an 18-year-old wife.

15
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,673
- How you doing, pal?
- Well, if l had your looks, better.

16
00:03:22,757 --> 00:03:26,385
Takes years of genetics,
a Yale education and the right tailor.

17
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:28,971
Not that you learned anything, Chunk.

18
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:35,061
Marv, l got a feeling that we
are gonna make a killing today.

19
00:03:35,144 --> 00:03:36,812
Yeah? Where's your machine gun?

20
00:03:36,896 --> 00:03:38,898
You can't make a buck in this market.

21
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:42,985
The country's going to hell faster
than when Roosevelt was in charge!

22
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:46,239
Too much cheap money
sloshing around the world.

23
00:03:46,322 --> 00:03:50,284
Worst mistake we ever made was
letting Nixon get off the gold standard.

24
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:52,703
Putney Drug - you boys
might wanna look at it.

25
00:03:52,787 --> 00:03:57,250
- No. They'll take five years to come around.
- But they got a good new drug.

26
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:01,337
Stick to the fundamentals.
That's how lBM and Hilton were built.

27
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,423
Good things sometimes take time.

28
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:09,053
(PA) Look sharp, especially you rookies.
Nikkei lndex closed up 90 points last night.

29
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:11,764
We expect heavy Japanese buying
on the opening.

30
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:16,894
The firm has 200,000 steel for sale.
A million Big Blue. 350,000 pork and beans.

31
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:22,024
Get on the horn with your institutions.
These utilities are our top priority today.

32
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:26,404
- OK. Let's go to work.
- And they're off and running!

33
00:04:26,487 --> 00:04:28,573
(bell rings)

34
00:04:42,086 --> 00:04:47,967
We cleared up to 60,000 XGC at 48 1/2.
Yes, that's right. Right.

35
00:04:52,972 --> 00:04:55,892
- The marketjust doubled.
- Brenner!

36
00:04:56,225 --> 00:04:59,020
Research has put thrifts
on the recommended.

37
00:04:59,103 --> 00:05:01,814
What? Dump it for chrissake!

38
00:05:01,898 --> 00:05:06,527
30,000. Three-eight top.
l go along at 23. You got it.

39
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:09,697
Now you own it!
Conwest Air? Let me check it.

40
00:05:15,786 --> 00:05:17,997
Circle 29,000 Niagaras for Templeton.

41
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,086
Mr Harrison, are you aware that we are
in the biggest bull market of our generation?

42
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:28,049
No, sir, it's not what you think.
lf you take five minutes of your time...

43
00:05:28,549 --> 00:05:31,052
Dreyfus is looking for 50,000 Conair!

44
00:05:31,135 --> 00:05:33,679
September 50s? How about Decembers?

45
00:05:33,763 --> 00:05:36,432
Mr Zaros? Bud Fox, Jackson Steinem.

46
00:05:36,516 --> 00:05:37,975
Yes, sir, l am aware of that.

47
00:05:38,059 --> 00:05:42,355
But if l could have five minutes
to explain the opportunities emerging...

48
00:05:42,438 --> 00:05:44,440
..in the international debt market.

49
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:45,400
No, no...

50
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:47,318
Bud Fox, Jackson Steinem.

51
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:53,324
Yes, l am aware of this. But if l could just
explain the opportunities emerging...

52
00:05:53,407 --> 00:05:56,327
- ..in the international debt market...
- (line disconnects)

53
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,496
l'm sure that...

54
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,424
Yesterday concerns my future.
l need the info now, before the close.

55
00:06:10,508 --> 00:06:13,553
No, in ten minutes it's history.
At four l'm a dinosaur!

56
00:06:13,636 --> 00:06:19,016
Howard, l thought you were a gentleman.
Sure it's gone down. You got the tip. l didn't.

57
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,061
- Why would l tell you to sell it?
- Give it back!

58
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:24,856
To who? l can't give it back - you own it!

59
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:26,607
No, he's not here.

60
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:29,986
- (whispers) That's what you told us to say.
- Gimme that phone.

61
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:32,071
- Hello?
- Hello.

62
00:06:32,154 --> 00:06:35,741
- Who am l talking to?
- The sales manager. What's the problem?

63
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:40,413
What? Will you gimme a break? How was
l supposed to know you were in surgery?

64
00:06:40,538 --> 00:06:42,915
What am l - Marvin the Mindreader?!

65
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:47,962
Uh, no, sir. l'll discuss that with the
account executive, and l'll get back to you.

66
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:50,339
No, no, sir. You're welcome.

67
00:06:53,676 --> 00:06:57,305
l'm closing the account.
lf he doesn't pay tomorrow, you pay.

68
00:06:57,513 --> 00:06:59,849
Mr Lynch, l swear to you, he's lying.

69
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:02,268
We give you a rich man's account,...

70
00:07:02,351 --> 00:07:05,938
..and you tell me he's gonna DK you
for a lousy quarter point?

71
00:07:06,022 --> 00:07:10,401
You're being unfair, sir.
You know he's got a history for bullshit.

72
00:07:10,484 --> 00:07:13,029
Somebody's got to pay.

73
00:07:13,112 --> 00:07:15,406
Ain't gonna be me.

74
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:20,995
Buddy, Buddy.
A little trouble, huh, today, Buddy?

75
00:07:21,078 --> 00:07:25,791
Howard the jerk reneged on me. l gotta
cover his losses to the tune of seven grand.

76
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,335
Yeah! l'm holding!

77
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:30,922
l'm tapped out. American Express
got a hit man looking for me.

78
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:34,926
lt coulda been worse, right?
Coulda been my money.

79
00:07:36,594 --> 00:07:41,057
Here, here, rookie, let me help you out.
l got... a C-note.

80
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,395
- Thanks, Marv. l'll make it up to you.
- Yes, l am still here!

81
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:51,442
You know what my dream is?
To one day be on the other end of that phone.

82
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:54,779
Oh, you got it, baby.
Where the real cheesecake is.

83
00:07:55,947 --> 00:07:58,449
Hey, Bud, you forgetting something?

84
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:00,618
The Gekko phone call?

85
00:08:01,118 --> 00:08:05,915
When are you gonna realise it's the big game
hunters who bag elephants, not guys like us.

86
00:08:05,998 --> 00:08:08,251
- Gordon Gekko, please.
- Gekko's beautiful.

87
00:08:08,334 --> 00:08:12,171
30 seconds after the Challenger blew up,
he's selling NASA stock short.

88
00:08:12,255 --> 00:08:16,342
Yeah, but... 47 million he made
on the Melcore deal.

89
00:08:16,425 --> 00:08:19,345
23 on the lmperial deal before he was 40.

90
00:08:19,428 --> 00:08:24,559
The guy makes 20 times what Dave Winfield
makes in a year, and he talks to everybody.

91
00:08:24,642 --> 00:08:27,103
And he had an ethical bypass at birth.

92
00:08:27,186 --> 00:08:29,397
- Hello, Natalie. Guess who?
- Mr Fox.

93
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:35,945
Right. Every day l say to myself that today
could be the day. So will you marry me?

94
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:39,740
- l'll think about it.
- Then can you get me through to Mr Gekko?

95
00:08:39,824 --> 00:08:43,786
- He's very busy.
- Of course he is. Five minutes is all l ask.

96
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:49,542
Mr Fox, l'm sure you're a good broker,
but our traders deal with the brokers.

97
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,919
Mr Gekko deals with investment bankers.

98
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:56,299
- Tell him l called. There are big changes...
- Yes, l'll give him your message.

99
00:08:56,382 --> 00:09:02,013
Leo, l understand, but you have to realise
there'll be major subordinated debt involved.

100
00:09:16,694 --> 00:09:20,239
- Buddy, how ya doing?
- Great, Charlie. Any better would be a sin.

101
00:09:20,323 --> 00:09:25,328
Jesus Christ! Listen, l hear all you guys
on Wall Street are millionaires.

102
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:29,457
- When you gonna make us all rich?
- You need an account to win the lottery.

103
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,920
- Give me 50 grand. l'll get you a condo.
- Sure! We'll own the airline by then!

104
00:09:34,003 --> 00:09:38,549
Why don't he make himself rich,
so he can pay off his school loans?

105
00:09:38,758 --> 00:09:42,762
Nice to see you're in such a good mood, Dad.
Did Mom give you fish for dinner?

106
00:09:42,845 --> 00:09:46,349
You smoke too much. How often you
gotta go to the hospital to realise?

107
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:51,020
Leave me alone. lt's the only thing that
makes me feel good. There, Frank. All set.

108
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,774
Spaghetti!
Your mother still makes lousy spaghetti.

109
00:09:54,857 --> 00:09:59,320
- lt's pasta now. Spaghetti's out of date.
- So am l. You want a beer?

110
00:09:59,695 --> 00:10:02,532
Billie! Bring a Molson Lite for the kid!

111
00:10:03,741 --> 00:10:06,160
- Looking good, huh?
- He looks terrific.

112
00:10:06,244 --> 00:10:09,372
Carl, we'll be at the bar.

113
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:13,000
- l'll catch up with you.
- All right, Charlie.

114
00:10:14,877 --> 00:10:16,754
So...

115
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:21,509
You look like you've grown another inch,
but you don't look so hot, Buddy.

116
00:10:21,592 --> 00:10:25,596
- You're gonna get bags under your eyes.
- Yeah, l had a tough day.

117
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,684
- Some jerk DK'd me. l gotta cover his loss.
- Speak English.

118
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:33,271
DK: Didn't Know who l was
when the options he bought took a bath.

119
00:10:33,354 --> 00:10:36,899
- Bastard reneged on me!
- l told you not to get into that racket.

120
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:39,277
You coulda been a doctor or a lawyer.

121
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,241
lf you'd stayed at Bluestar, you coulda been a
supervisor now, instead of being a salesman.

122
00:10:45,324 --> 00:10:49,745
Dad, how many times l gotta tell you l am not
a salesman? l'm an account executive.

123
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:52,331
Soon l'm moving into investment banking.

124
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:55,626
You ask strangers for money -
you're a salesman.

125
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,005
Dad, it takes time.
You gotta build a client list.

126
00:10:59,088 --> 00:11:02,967
l can make more money in one year
as a broker than in five at this airline.

127
00:11:03,134 --> 00:11:05,136
Thank you, Billie.

128
00:11:05,219 --> 00:11:09,932
l don't get it, kid. You borrow money to go
to NYU. First year out, you make 35 grand.

129
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:13,936
You made 50 grand last year, and can't
pay off your loans. Where does it go?!

130
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,440
Dad, 50K does not get you
to first base in the Big Apple.

131
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:19,692
l got 40% in taxes, 15 grand for rent.

132
00:11:19,775 --> 00:11:24,530
l got school loans, car loans, food -
that's three bills a month. l need suits...

133
00:11:24,614 --> 00:11:29,118
Come back home and live rent-free
instead of that roach-infected place.

134
00:11:29,202 --> 00:11:32,872
$50,000! Jesus Christ!
The whole world's off its rocker!

135
00:11:32,955 --> 00:11:36,792
l made $47,000 last year. That's before taxes.

136
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:40,296
That's Queens, Dad! A 5% mortgage
and you rent the top room.

137
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:45,801
l gotta live in Manhattan to be a player.
There is no nobility in poverty any more, Dad.

138
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:48,596
One day you'll be proud of me. You'll see.

139
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:53,476
lt's yourself you gotta
be proud of, Huckleberry.

140
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,645
How much you need?

141
00:11:56,229 --> 00:11:59,941
Can you spare 300?
l'll pay you back next month, l promise.

142
00:12:00,024 --> 00:12:03,694
- l don't know if l got that much on me.
- Not in here. Please.

143
00:12:05,655 --> 00:12:08,991
lt adds up. 300 here, 200 there.
Your brother...

144
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:14,205
l always say money's something you need
in case you don't die tomorrow. Right, Carl?

145
00:12:14,288 --> 00:12:16,165
How you doing?

146
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:19,794
- How's work treating you?
- Damn mandatory drug test.

147
00:12:19,877 --> 00:12:24,757
They're driving us crazy. l got flagged for my
blood pressure pills. Can you believe that?

148
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,470
The good news is we had a meeting with
the controller about some union business.

149
00:12:29,554 --> 00:12:32,974
Remember the accident last year
and the investigation?

150
00:12:33,057 --> 00:12:38,729
The FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing
error in the door-latch mechanism. l knew it.

151
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:43,818
l kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance.
lt's the greedy manufacturers in Cincinnati.

152
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:47,321
- That's great.
- This gets us out from under suspension.

153
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:52,952
We can go for those new routes to Pittsburgh
and Boston. We'll compete with the big guys.

154
00:12:53,202 --> 00:12:58,040
To Bluestar. As your broker, all l can
advise is you hold on to that stock.

155
00:12:58,124 --> 00:13:00,626
What stock? Are you kiddin'?

156
00:13:01,502 --> 00:13:04,213
- Are you sure about this thing?
- What?

157
00:13:05,047 --> 00:13:07,884
- The FAA announcement.
- Sure l'm sure.

158
00:13:09,677 --> 00:13:14,682
Look at me. You got that
mischievous look in your eye, Buddy.

159
00:13:14,765 --> 00:13:17,894
You used to smile like that
when you were a kid sleeping.

160
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:20,771
lt's true. Just like that.

161
00:13:50,718 --> 00:13:53,262
(** computer plays "Happy Birthday")

162
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:03,523
Morning, Gordon.

163
00:14:12,156 --> 00:14:16,244
Delivery for Mr Gekko. lt's a personal item.
He needs you to sign for it.

164
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:17,995
Send him in.

165
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:36,472
Hello, Natalie. Recognise the voice? Here's
a hint - you're thinking about marrying me.

166
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:39,475
- Why are you here?
- You're lovelier than l pictured.

167
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:43,980
- Got a birthday present for Mr Gekko.
- You can't come barging in here.

168
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:48,901
- What makes you think it's his birthday?
- Well, it's in the bible, see?

169
00:14:48,985 --> 00:14:51,153
You better go buy him a gift.

170
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:56,868
Please, Natalie, let me give this to him.
Cuban cigars. His favourite and tough to get.

171
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:00,913
Please, Natalie?

172
00:15:03,124 --> 00:15:05,710
Stay here. l'll see what l can do.

173
00:15:24,562 --> 00:15:26,230
Wait outside.

174
00:15:28,482 --> 00:15:30,985
Yeah, l'll see you shortly, l hope.

175
00:15:43,664 --> 00:15:45,750
Five minutes.

176
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,759
Well, life all comes down to a few moments.

177
00:15:55,384 --> 00:15:57,470
This is one of 'em.

178
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:01,891
What the hell's going on?

179
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:06,646
l'm looking at 200,000 shares move, pal.
l wanna know if we're part of it.

180
00:16:06,729 --> 00:16:10,816
We'd better be, or l'm gonna come
and eat your lunch for you. Back in two.

181
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,279
Sorry, Jeff. Look, l loved it at 40.
lt's an insult at 50.

182
00:16:15,404 --> 00:16:19,033
Their analysts don't know
preferred stock from livestock.

183
00:16:19,116 --> 00:16:24,163
Wait till it heads south, then we raise the
sperm count on the deal. Get back at ya.

184
00:16:25,706 --> 00:16:30,920
This is the kid. Calls me 59 days in a row.
Wants to be a player.

185
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:34,048
Oughta be in the dictionary
under "persistence".

186
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:38,636
Listen, Jerry, l'm looking for negative control.
No more than 30, 35%.

187
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:44,308
Just enough to block anybody else's merger
plans, and find out if the books are cooked.

188
00:16:44,392 --> 00:16:48,062
lf it looks as good as on paper,
we're in the kill zone, pal.

189
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:52,149
Lunch? You kiddin'? Lunch is for wimps.
OK, Billy. l'll talk at ya.

190
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,614
How do you do, Mr Gekko? l'm Bud Fox.

191
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:01,951
So you say. Nice to meet you.
Hope you're intelligent.

192
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:06,664
- Where'd you get these?
- l got a connection at the airport.

193
00:17:06,747 --> 00:17:10,376
So what's on your mind, kemo sabe?
Why am l listening to you?

194
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:14,297
l gotta monitor my blood pressure,
so don't upset me.

195
00:17:14,422 --> 00:17:15,882
No. No, sir.

196
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:21,179
ln 45 seconds, the microprocessor computes
your systolic and diastolic pressure.

197
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:25,766
Got an LCD read-out, cost-effective...
Less than one visit to a doctor.

198
00:17:28,186 --> 00:17:34,025
l just wanna let you know l've read all about
you at NYU Business. l think you're a genius.

199
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:38,988
l've always dreamed of one thing and
that's to do business with a man like you.

200
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,365
- What firm you with?
- Jackson Steinem.

201
00:17:41,449 --> 00:17:44,243
They're going places.
Good junk-bond department.

202
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:47,246
You the financing on
that Jansen investment?

203
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,625
Yeah. l'm working on
some other interesting stuff.

204
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,294
Cosmetic company, by any chance?

205
00:17:53,377 --> 00:17:56,088
Are you twelfth man on the deal team?
Last to know?

206
00:17:56,714 --> 00:18:00,551
- l can't tell you that, Mr Gekko.
- So what you got for me, sport?

207
00:18:00,635 --> 00:18:03,346
Chart breakout on
Whitewood-Young lndustries.

208
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:08,142
Explosive earnings. A 30% discount from
book. Great cash flow. Couple of 5% holders.

209
00:18:08,226 --> 00:18:10,102
- lt's a dog.
- Strong management.

210
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:14,899
lt's a dog, pal. What else you got
besides connections at the airport?

211
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:18,110
(secretary) Mr Stevenson in San Francisco.

212
00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:23,991
- He respond?
- Lecturing on economics.

213
00:18:24,075 --> 00:18:26,160
- What?!
- No, he's in Chicago.

214
00:18:26,244 --> 00:18:31,082
Why the hell is Cromwell giving a lecture
tour when he's losing 60 million a quarter?!

215
00:18:31,165 --> 00:18:33,793
Guess he's giving lectures
in how to lose money.

216
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:39,090
lf this guy owned a funeral parlour,
no one would die! This turkey is braindead!

217
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:43,803
OK. All right, Christmas is over,
and business is business.

218
00:18:43,886 --> 00:18:46,889
You keep on buying. Dilute the son of a bitch!

219
00:18:46,973 --> 00:18:50,726
Ollie, l want every orifice
in his fuckin' body flowin' red!

220
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,020
He's flowin', Gordo. Piece of cake.

221
00:18:53,104 --> 00:18:55,523
This guy's the best trader on the street.

222
00:18:55,606 --> 00:19:00,528
Susan, get me the LBO analysis
on Teldar Paper. Bring it in here, please.

223
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:03,739
- (intercom) Mr Gekko, your wife.
- What else you got?

224
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:09,996
Terafly. Analysts don't like it. l do.
The break-up value is twice the market price.

225
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,165
This deal finances itself.
You sell off two divisions...

226
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:16,669
Not bad for a quant,
but that's a dog with different fleas.

227
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:20,172
Come on, pal.
Tell me something l don't know.

228
00:19:20,256 --> 00:19:22,508
lt's my birthday.

229
00:19:22,592 --> 00:19:24,677
Surprise me.

230
00:19:28,306 --> 00:19:30,391
- Bluestar.
- What?

231
00:19:31,225 --> 00:19:34,812
- Bluestar Airlines.
- Rings a bell somewhere. So what?

232
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:40,067
lt's a comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots.

233
00:19:40,151 --> 00:19:44,697
Flies to Florida, Canada,
uh, Northeast, the Caribbean.

234
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,576
- Great slots in major cities.
- l don't like airlines. Lousy unions.

235
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:51,787
Well, there was a crash last year.

236
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:54,749
They just got a favourable
ruling on a lawsuit.

237
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:57,668
Even the plaintiffs don't know about it.

238
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,671
Well, how do you know about it?

239
00:20:01,297 --> 00:20:03,216
l just know.

240
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,761
The decision should clear the way
for new planes and routes.

241
00:20:06,844 --> 00:20:10,848
There's only a small float. You should grab it.
Good for a five-point pop.

242
00:20:10,932 --> 00:20:13,559
250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Jansen.

243
00:20:13,643 --> 00:20:17,188
l can pull twice that at 18 1/2
from the California pensions.

244
00:20:17,271 --> 00:20:20,483
We got close to half a million
shares in the bag.

245
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:24,153
The Terminator!
Blow 'em away, Ollie!

246
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:28,449
We got the Beezer Brothers.
l'm working on the Silverberg boys.

247
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:33,120
Rip their fuckin' throats out!
Stuff 'em in your garbage compactor!

248
00:20:33,204 --> 00:20:35,289
lnteresting. Got a card?

249
00:20:35,915 --> 00:20:38,000
Home number's on the back.

250
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:41,921
Bud Fox, l look at a hundred
deals a day. l choose one.

251
00:20:42,004 --> 00:20:45,550
- l hope to hear from you, sir.
- Thanks for the cigars.

252
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:48,761
Let's go, guys. Looks like
we're going over 5% in Teldar.

253
00:20:48,845 --> 00:20:51,806
Start the lawyers on a tender offer and 13D.

254
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:54,767
We buy everything in sight,
but we don't pay over 22.

255
00:20:55,226 --> 00:20:58,896
They'll fight. They got Myers
and Thromberg doing their legal.

256
00:21:00,481 --> 00:21:02,984
- Thanks, Natalie.
- Have a nice day, Mr Fox.

257
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:08,030
Mr Gekko, your conference call is ready. Mr
Sugarman in Delaware, Mr Bernard in LA,...

258
00:21:08,114 --> 00:21:11,284
..Mr Jackson and Ms Rosco
in London. They're all on.

259
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:14,745
Please, l'm begging you.
l'm in a bind down here.

260
00:21:15,162 --> 00:21:20,293
We got all these damn new computers and
young men that are edging me out here.

261
00:21:21,836 --> 00:21:24,338
Hey, Bud! Did he see you?

262
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,966
Yeah, he saw right through me.

263
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:30,678
Cheer up. You shook Gekko's hand
and you still got all your fingers.

264
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:34,140
Besides, he's not the only
elephant in the jungle.

265
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:37,852
Holy cow! Did you get something
from him? Teldar Paper, huh?

266
00:21:37,935 --> 00:21:40,646
Nah. lt's a dog with fleas.

267
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:46,569
Fox, where have you been
for the last three hours, hm?

268
00:21:47,069 --> 00:21:50,656
lf l were you, and l thank
my personal God l am not,...

269
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,367
..l wouldn't be sitting around chinwagging.

270
00:21:53,451 --> 00:21:58,039
Plenty of six-figure names
in that zip-code pile to cold-call.

271
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:06,672
Buddy, l got tickets for the Knick game
tonight. Cruise some chicks afterwards.

272
00:22:06,756 --> 00:22:07,840
Whaddaya say?

273
00:22:07,924 --> 00:22:10,968
- No, l gotta read my charts.
- Forget charts, will ya?

274
00:22:11,052 --> 00:22:13,846
We're not fund managers.
Churn 'em and burn 'em!

275
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,390
l am offering you the Knicks and chicks.

276
00:22:16,474 --> 00:22:20,895
God help you before you turn
into poor Steeples over there.

277
00:22:22,396 --> 00:22:24,732
Preferably Lou Mannheim.

278
00:22:24,815 --> 00:22:30,696
Yeah, nice guy, but he's a loser. He lost all
his equity when the firm went belly-up in '71.

279
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,824
You wanna be in your sixties still pitching?

280
00:22:33,908 --> 00:22:38,412
Hey, Buddy, whatever happened to
that cute analyst at Thudder and Wicks?

281
00:22:38,496 --> 00:22:42,416
Cindy. Having sex with her
was like reading the Wall Street Journal.

282
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,794
- She had a heartbeat.
- You wanna bet?

283
00:22:45,086 --> 00:22:47,797
l gotta get to work. Zs today.

284
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,259
Call for you, Buddy! Pick up two!

285
00:22:54,136 --> 00:22:56,931
- Bud Fox.
- All right, Bud Fox.

286
00:22:57,014 --> 00:23:00,560
l want you to buy 20,000 shares of Bluestar...

287
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:05,565
..at fifteen and an eighth,
three-eighths tops.

288
00:23:06,357 --> 00:23:08,860
And don't screw it up, sport.

289
00:23:09,151 --> 00:23:14,407
- Think you can handle that?
- Yes, sir! Thank you. You won't regret this.

290
00:23:14,574 --> 00:23:17,702
Whoo! Marv, l just bagged the elephant!

291
00:23:20,037 --> 00:23:21,289
Gekko?

292
00:23:55,406 --> 00:23:58,492
- Hiya, sport.
- Nice to see you again, Mr Gekko.

293
00:23:58,576 --> 00:24:02,121
Try the steak tartare. lt's off the menu.
Louis'll make it for you.

294
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:07,251
- (Louis) Of course, sir. Anything to drink?
- Just an Evian, please.

295
00:24:07,335 --> 00:24:11,881
Hey, see this? Can you believe it?
lt's got a two-inch screen.

296
00:24:11,964 --> 00:24:14,342
l can hardly see it.

297
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:18,429
lt's for my kid - Rudy.
Three years old, he's an electronics freak.

298
00:24:18,513 --> 00:24:21,432
We're going into a new age, pal.

299
00:24:22,225 --> 00:24:24,310
So how's business today?

300
00:24:24,393 --> 00:24:29,065
Great. Bluestar was at 17 1/4
when l left the office. Up from 15.

301
00:24:29,148 --> 00:24:31,234
Might spin up to 18 by the bell.

302
00:24:31,317 --> 00:24:34,904
Teldar's shooting up.
Did you buy any for yourself?

303
00:24:34,987 --> 00:24:39,742
l bet you were on the phone
two minutes after you got out of my office.

304
00:24:39,951 --> 00:24:43,162
No, sir, that wouldn't have been legal.

305
00:24:43,246 --> 00:24:47,833
Sure. Relax, pal.
No one's gonna blow the whistle on you.

306
00:24:49,168 --> 00:24:53,089
ls that legal? Why don't you
put that in my account?

307
00:24:53,172 --> 00:24:56,717
- Hey, Gordon!
- Georgie! The cellular king! How you been?

308
00:24:56,801 --> 00:25:00,096
- Monique, nice to see you, my dear.
- Hello, Gordon.

309
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:04,016
- You look wonderful.
- You're looking very well yourself.

310
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,185
And Mr Davis...

311
00:25:07,103 --> 00:25:10,439
Can l get the check here, please?
For chrissakes!

312
00:25:10,523 --> 00:25:15,862
Cover that Bluestar buy. Put 200 thou on one
of those bow-wow stocks you mentioned.

313
00:25:15,945 --> 00:25:21,075
Pick the dog with the least fleas.
Use a stop-loss, so your downside's 100 thou.

314
00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:25,872
And buy a decent suit.
You can't come in here looking like this.

315
00:25:25,955 --> 00:25:28,165
Go to Morty Sills. Tell him l sent you.

316
00:25:28,249 --> 00:25:33,087
Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr Gekko. Thank you
for the chance. You will not regret this.

317
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,839
You're with a winner.

318
00:25:34,922 --> 00:25:36,841
Right... right...

319
00:25:37,842 --> 00:25:42,555
Put the rest of the money in a tax-free fund.
l wanna see how you do before l invest it.

320
00:25:42,638 --> 00:25:45,349
And save the cheap salesman talk.
lt's obvious.

321
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:48,060
- Excuse me, sir?
- You heard me.

322
00:25:48,644 --> 00:25:53,149
l don't like losses, sport.
Nothing ruins my day more than losses.

323
00:25:53,232 --> 00:25:56,527
Now you do good... you get perks.

324
00:25:57,195 --> 00:25:59,280
Lots and lots of perks.

325
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,326
- Louis, take care of my friend.
- Thank you, sir.

326
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:05,494
Have a good lunch, Buddy.

327
00:26:07,246 --> 00:26:09,332
Hi, Richard.

328
00:26:22,803 --> 00:26:24,889
(knock on door)

329
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,821
Hi, Bud.

330
00:26:40,905 --> 00:26:42,156
Hi.

331
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,451
l'm Lisa. A friend of Gordon's.

332
00:26:46,869 --> 00:26:50,623
Lisa? Gordon? Oh, oh, Mr Gekko. Sure.

333
00:26:51,916 --> 00:26:54,418
Uh, would you like to come in?

334
00:26:54,835 --> 00:26:56,629
Didn't he tell you?

335
00:26:56,712 --> 00:26:59,549
Oh, that's so like Gordon.

336
00:27:00,091 --> 00:27:03,970
Why don't you get dressed? We're going out.

337
00:27:04,554 --> 00:27:06,639
We are?

338
00:27:24,699 --> 00:27:27,076
So... where are we going?

339
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:29,245
Wherever you like.

340
00:27:29,871 --> 00:27:33,541
Lutéce. 21. The River Café.

341
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,794
Or maybe we could just...

342
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:40,173
..drive around for a while.

343
00:27:42,008 --> 00:27:44,510
Work up an appetite.

344
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,765
Want some?

345
00:27:54,729 --> 00:27:57,857
Gordon tells me that
you're a very talented broker.

346
00:27:59,692 --> 00:28:01,777
What do you like?

347
00:28:02,445 --> 00:28:04,780
Like? (clears throat) Well...

348
00:28:04,989 --> 00:28:08,784
l've got this guy who tells me
to buy Hewlett-Packard,...

349
00:28:08,868 --> 00:28:11,370
..but l've been burned on tips.

350
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:16,500
Uh... Hewlett.
Now, let's see. lt closed at 41 1/4.

351
00:28:17,001 --> 00:28:19,670
Up an eighth. Very attractive.

352
00:28:21,047 --> 00:28:23,549
About, uh... average yield.

353
00:28:24,258 --> 00:28:26,219
- Very attractive.
- Mmm...

354
00:28:26,302 --> 00:28:28,596
- Rising profits.
- Ooh!

355
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:30,723
Strong balance sheet.

356
00:28:30,806 --> 00:28:32,683
You're hot on this stock.

357
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:35,478
Uh... lt's ready to take off.

358
00:28:36,103 --> 00:28:38,814
l'd jump all over it if l were you.

359
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:44,237
- Good morning, Carolyn.
- Morning. You look happy.

360
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,366
- Any better and l'd be guilty.
- You were never innocent, sugar pie.

361
00:28:48,449 --> 00:28:51,160
How do you know? You wish!

362
00:30:07,486 --> 00:30:12,283
Goddamn! We sure went down
the toilet on that ugly bitch!

363
00:30:12,408 --> 00:30:18,331
Oh, Buddy! Mr Gekko's office is looking
for you. Be at the Wyatt Club courts at six.

364
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:32,386
Come on, sport. You gotta try harder.

365
00:30:33,304 --> 00:30:35,932
l need some exercise, for chrissakes.

366
00:30:37,517 --> 00:30:42,230
- l don't think l can go on, Mr Gekko.
- Push yourself. Finish out the game.

367
00:30:43,606 --> 00:30:45,942
lt's a very nice club, Mr Gekko.

368
00:30:46,025 --> 00:30:47,777
Yeah.

369
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,363
Not bad for a City College boy.

370
00:30:51,697 --> 00:30:56,619
Bought my way in. Now all these lvy League
schmucks are sucking my kneecaps.

371
00:30:57,995 --> 00:31:00,915
l just got on the board of the Bronx Zoo.

372
00:31:01,249 --> 00:31:03,543
lt cost me a mil.

373
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,296
That's the thing you gotta
remember about WASPs.

374
00:31:07,463 --> 00:31:10,591
They love animals,
but they can't stand people.

375
00:31:12,885 --> 00:31:15,054
Uh, Mr Gekko,...

376
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:18,140
..we took a little loss today.

377
00:31:18,766 --> 00:31:22,812
We got stopped out on Terafly.
About a hundred grand.

378
00:31:27,733 --> 00:31:32,697
Well, l guess your dad's not a union
representative of that company, huh?

379
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,366
How do you know about my father?

380
00:31:35,658 --> 00:31:39,787
The most valuable commodity
l know of is information.

381
00:31:40,413 --> 00:31:42,498
Wouldn't you agree?

382
00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:44,876
Yeah.

383
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:54,135
The public's out there
throwing darts at a board, sport.

384
00:31:55,845 --> 00:32:00,558
l don't throw darts at a board.
l bet on sure things.

385
00:32:01,767 --> 00:32:04,562
Read Sun Tzu, The Art of War.

386
00:32:04,645 --> 00:32:08,816
"Every battle is won before it's ever fought."

387
00:32:09,525 --> 00:32:11,652
Think about it.

388
00:32:11,736 --> 00:32:14,280
You're not as smart as l thought you were.

389
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:18,492
You ever wonder why fund managers
can't beat the S&P 500?

390
00:32:18,576 --> 00:32:21,913
Cos they're sheep.
And sheep get slaughtered.

391
00:32:23,831 --> 00:32:26,834
l've been in this business since '69.

392
00:32:26,918 --> 00:32:30,505
Most of these Harvard MBA types
don't add up to dogshit.

393
00:32:30,588 --> 00:32:35,176
You need guys that are poor,
smart and hungry. And no feelings.

394
00:32:35,426 --> 00:32:39,597
You win a few, you lose a few,
but you keep on fighting.

395
00:32:40,139 --> 00:32:44,894
And if you need a friend, get a dog.
lt's trench warfare out there, pal.

396
00:32:44,977 --> 00:32:47,063
- Hey, Georgie.
- Hey, Gordon.

397
00:32:47,146 --> 00:32:51,275
- How's Larchmont treating you?
- Fine. How's the Praxar deal going?

398
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:54,070
- You should know, pal.
- Asshole!

399
00:32:55,696 --> 00:32:57,782
And inside here, too.

400
00:32:59,283 --> 00:33:03,829
l got 20 other brokers analysing charts, pal.
l don't need another one.

401
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,124
See you around, Buddy.

402
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:12,630
l am notjust another broker, Mr Gekko.
lf you give me another chance, l'll prove it.

403
00:33:12,713 --> 00:33:16,634
l'll go the extra yard for you.
Just one more chance, Mr Gekko. Please!

404
00:33:16,717 --> 00:33:22,890
Want another chance? Then stop sending me
information, and start getting me some.

405
00:33:23,933 --> 00:33:26,644
Get dressed. l'll show you my charts.

406
00:33:30,481 --> 00:33:34,360
- You know the name?
- Larry Wildman, one of the first raiders.

407
00:33:34,443 --> 00:33:39,574
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits, thinks
he was born with a better pot to piss in.

408
00:33:39,657 --> 00:33:42,451
Bribed an old secretary of mine
to open her mouth.

409
00:33:42,535 --> 00:33:45,955
Stole RDL Pharmaceuticals
right from under me.

410
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:48,124
Wildman, the "White Knight".

411
00:33:48,207 --> 00:33:51,586
l remember that deal.
You were involved, Mr Gekko?

412
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:53,713
Payback time, sport.

413
00:33:53,796 --> 00:33:59,302
See that building? l bought that building
ten years ago. My first real-estate deal.

414
00:33:59,385 --> 00:34:03,556
Sold it two years later.
Made an $800,000 profit.

415
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,143
lt was better than sex.

416
00:34:07,226 --> 00:34:12,565
At the time l thought that was all the money
in the world. Now it's a day's pay.

417
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:16,819
Anyway, l had a mole in Wildman's operation.

418
00:34:16,903 --> 00:34:21,324
- He gave me half the picture, then got fired.
- l don't think l follow you.

419
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:25,703
Wildman's in town.
He just became an American citizen.

420
00:34:25,786 --> 00:34:28,331
Something big is going down, OK?

421
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:34,045
l wanna know where he goes, what he sees. l
want you, pal, to fill out the missing picture.

422
00:34:36,881 --> 00:34:40,635
Mr Gekko, it's not exactly what l do.
l could lose my licence.

423
00:34:40,718 --> 00:34:46,766
lf the SEC found out, l could go to jail.
That's inside information, isn't it?

424
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:51,229
Like when a father tells his son
about a court ruling on an airline?

425
00:34:51,312 --> 00:34:55,566
Or someone overhears l'm buying Teldar,
and decides he's gonna buy some?

426
00:34:55,650 --> 00:35:00,613
Or the chairman of the board of XYZ
decides it's time to blow out XYZ?

427
00:35:00,696 --> 00:35:02,782
ls that what you mean?

428
00:35:05,701 --> 00:35:10,456
Unless your father's on the board
of directors of another company,...

429
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:14,669
..you and l are gonna have a very
tough time doing business together.

430
00:35:14,752 --> 00:35:18,047
- What about hard work?
- What about it? You work hard?

431
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:22,385
Bet you stayed up analysing that stock
you gave me. Where'd it get you?

432
00:35:22,468 --> 00:35:27,557
My father worked like an elephant till
he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack.

433
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,767
Wake up, will ya, pal?

434
00:35:29,851 --> 00:35:33,145
lf you're not inside, you are outside, OK?

435
00:35:33,229 --> 00:35:36,858
l'm not talking about some
$400,000-a-year Wall Street stiff,...

436
00:35:36,941 --> 00:35:41,571
..flying first class and being comfortable.
l'm talking about liquid.

437
00:35:41,654 --> 00:35:44,574
Rich enough to have your own jet.

438
00:35:44,657 --> 00:35:47,577
Rich enough not to waste time.

439
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,580
Fifty, a hundred million dollars, Buddy.

440
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:53,624
A player,...

441
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:55,793
..or nothing.

442
00:35:57,336 --> 00:36:00,798
Now you had what it took
to get into my office.

443
00:36:00,882 --> 00:36:04,844
The real question is whether
you got what it takes to stay.

444
00:36:08,723 --> 00:36:10,183
Look at that.

445
00:36:10,266 --> 00:36:15,021
You're gonna tell me the difference
between this guy and that guy is luck?

446
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,066
Mohammed, pull over.

447
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,570
lf you don't mind, l'm gonna
drop you off here. l'm late.

448
00:36:22,653 --> 00:36:25,615
Buddy, it's been nice meeting you, OK?

449
00:36:41,047 --> 00:36:43,132
(Buddy taps on window)

450
00:36:48,304 --> 00:36:50,389
All right, Mr Gekko.

451
00:36:51,641 --> 00:36:53,726
You got me.

452
00:37:55,037 --> 00:37:56,914
Excuse me, please.

453
00:37:56,998 --> 00:37:58,666
Excuse me.

454
00:38:13,806 --> 00:38:16,058
l'm sorry, sir. Do you have a reservation?

455
00:38:16,142 --> 00:38:20,313
- Uh, table for one.
- Reservations only. We're booked for a week.

456
00:38:20,396 --> 00:38:22,106
All right. Don't touch.

457
00:38:49,717 --> 00:38:51,802
Everything ready, sir.

458
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:11,405
Excuse me! ls Mr Wildman
on board that plane?

459
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:15,535
Shit! My boss is gonna kill me!
l'm supposed to give him this.

460
00:39:15,618 --> 00:39:18,871
- You know where that plane is going?
- Erie, Pennsylvania.

461
00:39:18,955 --> 00:39:21,040
Thank you.

462
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:27,713
After spending the morning at Kahn
Seidelman in the junk-bond department,...

463
00:39:27,797 --> 00:39:32,969
..he had lunch at that restaurant, Le Circus,
with some well-dressed bean counters.

464
00:39:33,344 --> 00:39:37,723
He later stopped off at Morgan. l'd say
from all the smiling and palm-pressing...

465
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:40,601
..Larry got himself some
nice fat financing, GG.

466
00:39:40,685 --> 00:39:45,231
Bright, but not bright enough, Sherlock.
Roll the dice and play Monopoly.

467
00:39:45,314 --> 00:39:48,734
What box is Sir Larry gonna
land on in Erie, Pennsylvania?

468
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:54,156
Jesus Christ! He's buying Anacott Steel.

469
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:00,913
OK. When the market opens tomorrow,
l want you to buy 1500 July 50 calls.

470
00:40:01,706 --> 00:40:03,374
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

471
00:40:03,457 --> 00:40:08,379
And start buying 1,000-share blocks
and take it up to $50.

472
00:40:08,713 --> 00:40:12,800
When it reaches 50,
give out a little taste to your friends.

473
00:40:12,884 --> 00:40:18,055
Then l want you to call
the Wall Street Chronicle, extension 1605.

474
00:40:18,931 --> 00:40:23,394
You tell the man
"Blue Horseshoe loves Anacott Steel".

475
00:40:23,477 --> 00:40:25,980
- You got that?
- The Wall Street Chronicle.

476
00:40:26,063 --> 00:40:30,443
Congratulations, Buddy.
You scored. l'll talk at ya.

477
00:40:33,446 --> 00:40:36,699
Start buying Anacott Steel across the board.

478
00:40:36,782 --> 00:40:39,285
Use the offshore accounts.

479
00:40:40,077 --> 00:40:42,496
And keep it quiet.

480
00:40:49,837 --> 00:40:54,008
Frank, 10,000 ANC at 46. Let me know
how the options are opening, OK?

481
00:40:54,091 --> 00:40:55,760
Thank you.

482
00:40:59,555 --> 00:41:01,474
Jackson Steinem!

483
00:41:04,727 --> 00:41:08,147
- How is Anacott Steel?
- 5 3/4, 6. 2,000 up.

484
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:10,942
- Six at 10,000.
- l'll sell you 2,000.

485
00:41:11,025 --> 00:41:13,945
That's not what l said. l said 20,000 shares.

486
00:41:22,662 --> 00:41:25,164
(trader) Anacott trades at six.

487
00:41:25,915 --> 00:41:29,043
- 8,000 at a quarter?
- l'll take 8,000.

488
00:41:29,126 --> 00:41:31,420
Make it six to a half, 2,000 up.

489
00:41:32,505 --> 00:41:35,842
(Marvin) l know what time it is,
and this is what l'm saying.

490
00:41:35,925 --> 00:41:42,056
We have important financial news, Mr Erlich,
that just happens to concern your future.

491
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:47,979
- You could benefit... What's going on?
- Anacott Steel. Put your best customers in it.

492
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:53,693
Lou, l got a sure thing.

493
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,987
Anacott Steel.

494
00:41:56,070 --> 00:42:01,701
No such thing, except death and taxes. Not
a good company any more. No fundamentals.

495
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,745
What's goin' on, Bud?

496
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:08,875
You know something?

497
00:42:09,876 --> 00:42:13,004
Remember, there are no short cuts, son.

498
00:42:13,546 --> 00:42:16,883
Quick-buck artists come and go
with every bull market.

499
00:42:16,966 --> 00:42:19,927
The steady players make it
through the bear markets.

500
00:42:20,011 --> 00:42:22,054
You're a part of something here, Bud.

501
00:42:22,138 --> 00:42:26,934
The money you make for people creates
science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.

502
00:42:27,018 --> 00:42:31,647
You're right, but you gotta get to the
big time first, then you can do good things.

503
00:42:31,731 --> 00:42:36,861
- You can't get a little bit pregnant, son.
- Lou, trust me. lt's a winner. Buy it.

504
00:42:38,613 --> 00:42:42,325
We'll kamikaze over to Nell's,
chase some cotton underwear.

505
00:42:42,408 --> 00:42:46,704
l know this 18-year-old bimbette
that's gorgeous. Hold on.

506
00:42:46,787 --> 00:42:52,376
- Play tennis Saturday?
- Can't. Fly-fishing in Canada. Real big client.

507
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,296
- Take Anacott?
- Light snack, but good. Thanks, pal.

508
00:42:55,379 --> 00:42:58,257
You're sharking your way up.

509
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,552
No, no, my dear, you've got to diversify.

510
00:43:01,636 --> 00:43:04,555
l got a sure thing. Anacott Steel.

511
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:07,391
l've just heard the most lovely two words.

512
00:43:09,352 --> 00:43:11,771
Blue Horseshoe loves Anacott Steel.

513
00:43:11,854 --> 00:43:13,272
Anacott Steel.

514
00:43:27,537 --> 00:43:32,124
Looks like Anacott Steel's in play.
Check the ARBs.

515
00:43:34,126 --> 00:43:37,129
Looks like it's being accumulated.

516
00:43:37,213 --> 00:43:42,343
Lou? Anacott. l buy. Yeah.
Take it and bid it.

517
00:43:42,552 --> 00:43:45,179
Quarters won't matter.
Keep taking Anacott.

518
00:43:45,346 --> 00:43:48,015
This is special. Anacott. Paint the tape.

519
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:50,351
- Bet the ranch.
- Buy 100,000 shares.

520
00:43:50,434 --> 00:43:53,354
- Wildman is sniffing around.
- lt's on automatic pilot to the moon.

521
00:43:53,437 --> 00:43:56,607
- lf it hits 75, we'll clean 24 mil.
- (Gekko) Relax, pal.

522
00:43:56,983 --> 00:44:00,820
Don't get emotional about stock.
lt clouds the judgment.

523
00:44:00,903 --> 00:44:06,117
Which closed at 5 1/8, up 5 1/8 from
yesterday's close on heavy trading.

524
00:44:21,674 --> 00:44:23,384
Can l help you?

525
00:44:23,467 --> 00:44:26,596
Yes, l'm Bud Fox. l have some
papers for Mr Gekko to sign.

526
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:29,140
- Come in.
- Thank you.

527
00:44:31,392 --> 00:44:35,021
- l'm sorry about this, Mr Gekko.
- lt's all right. lt's OK.

528
00:44:36,272 --> 00:44:38,524
You wanna wait here?

529
00:44:38,608 --> 00:44:39,859
Problems?

530
00:44:39,942 --> 00:44:42,570
No problem.
This is Bud Fox. My wife, Kate.

531
00:44:42,653 --> 00:44:45,907
- Hello. You came out from the city?
- Yes, ma'am.

532
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:49,160
Ah, long drive. You want a drink?

533
00:44:49,243 --> 00:44:51,454
Yeah, you want a drink? Um... sure.

534
00:44:51,537 --> 00:44:54,373
- lf you'd rather not.
- No, come on. Have a drink.

535
00:44:54,457 --> 00:44:58,461
Get to meet all the people.
lt's a good idea.

536
00:44:58,544 --> 00:45:03,174
We got Sam Ruspoli, Carmen Winters,
Stone Livingston. This is Bud Fox.

537
00:45:03,925 --> 00:45:06,302
His illustrious wife, Muffie.

538
00:45:06,385 --> 00:45:10,973
Candice Rogers, Dick Brady.
Darien Taylor. All old friends.

539
00:45:11,057 --> 00:45:12,308
Hi.

540
00:45:16,896 --> 00:45:22,860
Great idea, Gordon. l know good help is hard
to find, but can it create a dry vodka martini?

541
00:45:22,985 --> 00:45:25,571
lt doesn't talk back or steal the silverware.

542
00:45:25,655 --> 00:45:29,242
And Dick here is gonna get me
an exemption, aren't you?

543
00:45:29,325 --> 00:45:35,081
l'm in St Kitts with this new
Kamali leopard-skin V-cut bikini,...

544
00:45:35,164 --> 00:45:39,877
..which is gonna turn back the clock on my
marriage five years. Know what l mean?

545
00:45:40,127 --> 00:45:43,840
Call for you, sir. Sir Lawrence Wildman.
He says it's important.

546
00:45:43,923 --> 00:45:45,591
Thank you, Nyung.

547
00:45:45,675 --> 00:45:50,012
Would you fix Mr Livingston another
martini? Stick around. This could be fun.

548
00:45:50,096 --> 00:45:55,101
lt's all because this Ukrainian bitch
botched the job on my wax on my bikini line.

549
00:45:55,184 --> 00:45:57,061
How ghastly! Sue her.

550
00:45:57,478 --> 00:46:00,565
- Larry, what a surprise!
- l want to see you, Gordon.

551
00:46:00,648 --> 00:46:03,109
Can it wait till tomorrow? l got people here.

552
00:46:03,192 --> 00:46:08,531
- No, this can't wait. lt's important.
- OK. lf you feel that way, come on over.

553
00:46:10,408 --> 00:46:13,619
Ah! There you are!
Can l steal him for a minute?

554
00:46:13,703 --> 00:46:16,289
- Of course.
- l want your opinion.

555
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,340
So what do you see in this?

556
00:46:31,262 --> 00:46:33,973
Purity. lnnocence.

557
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:38,936
A few thousand dollars
down the tubes, if you ask me.

558
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,897
Really?

559
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:44,317
You can kiss your career
as an art appraiser goodbye.

560
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,446
We paid over 400,000 for it at the
contemporary picture sale last June.

561
00:46:48,529 --> 00:46:51,782
Jesus, you could've had
a whole beach house for that!

562
00:46:51,866 --> 00:46:55,203
Sure you could. ln Wildwood, New Jersey.

563
00:46:56,787 --> 00:47:00,374
lf you sold this one, you could
have a nice penthouse on Fifth.

564
00:47:01,834 --> 00:47:04,545
You wouldn't have much
left over for decoration.

565
00:47:04,629 --> 00:47:06,839
lt's nice, if you're on mushrooms.

566
00:47:06,923 --> 00:47:11,719
l thought Gordon was a tough businessman.
He sure has taken a bath on that.

567
00:47:11,886 --> 00:47:17,725
A bath? l'd say Gordon is one of
the most astute collectors around.

568
00:47:17,892 --> 00:47:21,521
He has a great eye, and he only buys the best.

569
00:47:21,604 --> 00:47:26,943
Like this rug, for instance.
A Bokhara. lt's the finest of its kind.

570
00:47:27,026 --> 00:47:31,030
After he bought it, a dealer
representing the Saudi royal family...

571
00:47:31,113 --> 00:47:35,618
..offered him twice what he paid.
lt absolutely makes the room.

572
00:47:36,077 --> 00:47:40,373
See how this bit of celadon in the border
is picked up by these cushions?

573
00:47:40,456 --> 00:47:44,585
Although it's a sacrilege
having that Etruscan vase on the table.

574
00:47:44,669 --> 00:47:47,171
Some dope might use it as an ashtray.

575
00:47:48,047 --> 00:47:51,259
- l guess you're a decorator?
- You got it.

576
00:47:51,342 --> 00:47:54,053
A great spender of other people's money.

577
00:47:54,136 --> 00:47:57,640
lf you're that good, l'm sure you
can do wonders with my place.

578
00:47:57,723 --> 00:48:00,685
- Where would that be?
- Upper West Side.

579
00:48:00,768 --> 00:48:05,857
Really? Home of the exposed
brick wall and the houseplant?

580
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:11,529
lt's just a rental. l'll be moving to the East
Side soon. Some deals brewing with Gordon.

581
00:48:11,612 --> 00:48:14,657
But that's just conversation.
What about real things?

582
00:48:14,782 --> 00:48:20,246
Like dinner? The two of us... next Friday?
Café Santo Domingo.

583
00:48:20,955 --> 00:48:23,499
What if l have a previous engagement?

584
00:48:23,666 --> 00:48:25,751
You break it.

585
00:48:25,835 --> 00:48:30,047
There you go again, Darien.
Talking with strange men.

586
00:48:30,131 --> 00:48:34,594
Hello. Sam, do you know Bud Fox?
Sam is in banking.

587
00:48:34,677 --> 00:48:38,222
- Works for Gordon.
- Nice meeting you.

588
00:48:38,306 --> 00:48:41,851
- Are you staying for dinner?
- No, l have work to do.

589
00:48:41,934 --> 00:48:44,020
- (doorbell)
- Ah. The bell.

590
00:48:46,898 --> 00:48:48,566
Excuse me.

591
00:48:49,692 --> 00:48:52,820
Call me next week. l'll give you an estimate.

592
00:48:56,699 --> 00:49:00,369
- Larry, how have you been?
- Fine. Travelling, actually.

593
00:49:00,453 --> 00:49:02,747
- Can l get you a drink?
- No, thank you.

594
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:06,250
Larry! Excuse me. Sir Larry.

595
00:49:07,376 --> 00:49:10,713
How are ya? Goddamn, you look great!

596
00:49:10,796 --> 00:49:14,008
- Gordon.
- So you wanna talk.

597
00:49:14,091 --> 00:49:18,095
- l'll be heading back now, Mr Gekko.
- Stick around.

598
00:49:18,179 --> 00:49:21,098
This is one of my gang. Bud Fox.

599
00:49:22,934 --> 00:49:25,019
Shall we go upstairs?

600
00:49:25,102 --> 00:49:26,562
Yeah.

601
00:49:37,198 --> 00:49:39,742
The rarest pistol in the world, Larry.

602
00:49:39,825 --> 00:49:42,203
A .45 Luger.

603
00:49:42,286 --> 00:49:45,248
Only six of 'em were ever manufactured.

604
00:49:46,582 --> 00:49:48,668
Congratulations.

605
00:49:49,627 --> 00:49:52,630
Rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.

606
00:49:52,713 --> 00:49:58,302
My interest is the same as yours. Money.
Thought it'd be a good investment for my kid.

607
00:49:58,386 --> 00:50:03,349
No, this time l'm in for the long term. lt's
not a liquidation. l'm gonna turn it around.

608
00:50:03,432 --> 00:50:06,561
You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate.

609
00:50:07,186 --> 00:50:11,691
With the dollars you're costing me to
buy back stock, l could modernise the plant.

610
00:50:11,774 --> 00:50:14,694
l'm not the only one who pays here, Gordon.

611
00:50:14,777 --> 00:50:19,115
We're talking about lives and jobs.
Four generations of steelworkers...

612
00:50:19,198 --> 00:50:25,496
Correct me if l'm wrong, but when you got
CNX Electronics, you laid off 6,000 workers.

613
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:29,125
Jemson Fruit, 4,000.
That airline you bought, um...

614
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:33,212
l could break you, mate.
ln two pieces over my knees.

615
00:50:33,713 --> 00:50:35,798
You know it. l know it.

616
00:50:35,882 --> 00:50:38,634
l could buy you six times over.

617
00:50:38,718 --> 00:50:41,429
l could dump the stockjust to burn your arse!

618
00:50:42,513 --> 00:50:46,642
But l happen to want the company,
and l want your block of shares.

619
00:50:47,476 --> 00:50:50,938
l'm announcing
a tender offer at 65 tomorrow.

620
00:50:51,397 --> 00:50:53,900
l'm expecting your commitment.

621
00:50:55,443 --> 00:51:00,406
Showdowns bore me, Larry. Nobody wins.
You can have the company.

622
00:51:00,489 --> 00:51:05,786
ln fact, it'll be fun watching you and your
giant ego trying to make a horse race of it.

623
00:51:06,579 --> 00:51:09,624
Buddy, what's a fair price for that stock?

624
00:51:09,707 --> 00:51:12,960
The break-up value is higher. lt's worth 80.

625
00:51:13,044 --> 00:51:18,090
Well, we don't want to be greedy.
So what do you say to 72?

626
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:23,846
You're a two-bit pirate and greenmailer.
Nothing more,...

627
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:26,182
..Gekko.

628
00:51:27,558 --> 00:51:32,438
Not only would you sell your mother
to make a deal, you'd send her COD.

629
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:36,526
My mail is the same colour as yours is, pal.

630
00:51:36,609 --> 00:51:40,488
Or at least it was until the Queen
started calling you "Sir".

631
00:51:41,822 --> 00:51:44,325
Excuse me before l lose my temper.

632
00:51:44,408 --> 00:51:46,077
71?

633
00:51:53,417 --> 00:51:56,504
Considering you brought my mother into it,...

634
00:51:56,587 --> 00:51:58,256
..71.50.

635
00:52:02,844 --> 00:52:04,929
Done.

636
00:52:05,012 --> 00:52:08,641
You'll hear from my lawyers
tomorrow, 8am. Good night.

637
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:18,860
He's right, l had to sell.
The key to the game is capital reserves.

638
00:52:18,943 --> 00:52:23,739
lf you don't have enough, you can't piss
in the tall weeds with the big dogs.

639
00:52:23,823 --> 00:52:27,034
"All warfare is based on deception." Sun Tzu.

640
00:52:27,535 --> 00:52:30,746
"lf your enemy is superior, evade him."

641
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:33,249
"lf angry, irritate him."

642
00:52:33,332 --> 00:52:38,754
"lf equally matched, fight.
And if not, split. Re-evaluate."

643
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:41,382
He's learning, huh? Buddy's learning!

644
00:52:43,176 --> 00:52:44,385
(phone ringing)

645
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:56,564
- Yeah?
- (Gekko) Money never sleeps, pal.

646
00:52:56,856 --> 00:53:00,401
Just made 800,000 in Hong Kong gold.
lt's been wired to you.

647
00:53:01,068 --> 00:53:05,907
Play with it. You done good,
but you gotta keep doing good.

648
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:09,243
l showed you how the game works.
Now school's out.

649
00:53:09,827 --> 00:53:12,455
Mr Gekko, l'm there for you 110%.

650
00:53:12,538 --> 00:53:17,168
No, no, no, no. You don't understand.
l wanna be surprised.

651
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:23,716
Astonish me, pal. New info.
l don't care where or how you get it.

652
00:53:24,217 --> 00:53:26,302
Just get it.

653
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:31,516
My wife tells me you made a move on Darien.

654
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,685
Here's some inside info for you.

655
00:53:34,769 --> 00:53:38,147
That GQ type she's going out with
got big bucks,...

656
00:53:38,231 --> 00:53:40,858
..but he's putting her feet to sleep.

657
00:53:40,942 --> 00:53:43,653
Exit visas are imminent.

658
00:53:43,736 --> 00:53:46,864
l don't want you losing your place in line.

659
00:53:48,616 --> 00:53:50,701
Ah, Jesus!

660
00:53:50,993 --> 00:53:53,287
l wish you could see this.

661
00:53:53,996 --> 00:53:56,499
The light's coming up.

662
00:54:00,044 --> 00:54:04,173
l've never seen a painting that
captures the beauty of the ocean...

663
00:54:04,257 --> 00:54:06,551
..at a moment like this.

664
00:54:08,261 --> 00:54:10,972
l'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox.

665
00:54:11,806 --> 00:54:16,018
Yeah. Rich enough
that you can afford a girl like Darien.

666
00:54:16,227 --> 00:54:18,729
This is your wake-up call, pal.

667
00:54:19,897 --> 00:54:21,983
Go to work.

668
00:54:37,415 --> 00:54:39,917
- Fox!
- Mr Barnes.

669
00:54:41,502 --> 00:54:45,923
Buddy D, is this déjâ vu?
What's it been? A year, year and a half?

670
00:54:46,007 --> 00:54:48,676
So, l hear you're moving up in the world.

671
00:54:48,759 --> 00:54:52,972
A senior associate. Not bad. Not bad.
How's Margie?

672
00:54:53,055 --> 00:54:56,475
l can't complain.
l got a house in Oyster Bay, you know.

673
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,811
Market treating you good?

674
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:03,858
- Still seeing that sexy French chick?
- No. No. She asked the wrong question.

675
00:55:03,941 --> 00:55:07,028
- What was that?
- "What are you thinking?"

676
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:14,577
The hours are hell, but the cash
is starting to tumble in.

677
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:19,457
l know this guy who has an ironclad way
of making money. l can't lose or get hurt.

678
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:24,295
Can't get hurt. So does this guy
have a tip for an honest lawyer?

679
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:28,299
Maybe. Check out Teldar Paper,...

680
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:30,635
..but don't quote me.

681
00:55:31,636 --> 00:55:37,433
And you? l hear you're handling the Fairchild
Foods merger, and it may not go through.

682
00:55:37,517 --> 00:55:41,187
Any surprises l haven't read about
in the Wall Street Journal?

683
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:44,982
Come on, that's illegal.
You wouldn't wanna get me disbarred.

684
00:55:45,066 --> 00:55:49,445
Who's listening?
Just one college buddy talking to another.

685
00:55:50,404 --> 00:55:54,200
- Yeah, right.
- Oh, relax, Roger.

686
00:55:54,283 --> 00:55:56,577
Everybody's doing it now.

687
00:55:57,078 --> 00:56:00,832
But, if you don't know,
then... you don't know.

688
00:56:06,504 --> 00:56:08,798
And if l did...

689
00:56:08,881 --> 00:56:11,092
..what's in it for moi?

690
00:56:12,593 --> 00:56:15,346
More money than you ever dreamed of.

691
00:56:16,264 --> 00:56:18,349
Nobody gets hurt.

692
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:22,061
You think about it.

693
00:56:23,521 --> 00:56:28,860
- Let's grab a beer. What do you say?
- Uh... too much to do. But l'll walk you out.

694
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,947
The file's on the desk, Marie.

695
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:36,784
Get inside my uncle's door
and the secrets of the world are yours.

696
00:56:36,868 --> 00:56:38,661
Lifeblood of companies...

697
00:56:38,744 --> 00:56:42,582
Of course, you gotta go
to law school first, but...

698
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:02,518
Mr Panos, l've been charting
the growth of office space.

699
00:57:02,602 --> 00:57:05,438
You're in the right business
at the right time.

700
00:57:05,521 --> 00:57:07,648
Thank you for tell me what l already know.

701
00:57:07,732 --> 00:57:11,652
Look, l'm very impressed with your work,
and l could use a tax break.

702
00:57:11,736 --> 00:57:15,656
Let me ask, what would you say to
some working capital and a partner?

703
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,617
Why do l need a partner?

704
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:22,163
Look, you need more vans. 42 employees
can't cover the buildings you got,...

705
00:57:22,246 --> 00:57:24,874
..not to mention the clients
we'd have together.

706
00:57:24,957 --> 00:57:29,629
l am an expert at identifying undervalued
assets such as this business.

707
00:58:18,553 --> 00:58:21,556
The good news, Gordon,
is Rorker Electronics.

708
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:24,809
That's right. l see it happening
in the next two months.

709
00:58:25,017 --> 00:58:27,645
Come on, their quarterlies are for shit.

710
00:58:28,229 --> 00:58:30,439
l got a little gift for you.

711
00:58:31,524 --> 00:58:35,194
Gordon will be very pleased.
What else have you got?

712
00:58:39,991 --> 00:58:41,868
You know Marty Weidman?

713
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:45,705
He netted 650G off of that merger.
26 years old, the guy's Rambo.

714
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,915
- He's an asshole!
- He is Rambo!

715
00:58:47,999 --> 00:58:51,002
He's got a Porsche Turbo
Cabriolet, about 75 thou.

716
00:58:51,085 --> 00:58:55,882
l think if l can make a bundle of cash
before l'm 30 and get out of this racket,...

717
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:59,218
..l'll be able to ride
my motorcycle across China.

718
00:59:00,052 --> 00:59:04,015
l'd like to do for furniture what
Laura Ashley did for interior fabrics.

719
00:59:04,098 --> 00:59:07,393
Produce a line of high-quality
antiques at a low price.

720
00:59:07,476 --> 00:59:09,645
Sounds great. l'll take you public.

721
00:59:09,729 --> 00:59:11,606
You will?

722
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:38,007
Can l help you?

723
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,802
Oh. Excuse me. ls this Bill Bates' office?

724
00:59:41,886 --> 00:59:43,179
No.

725
00:59:43,262 --> 00:59:45,223
l'm sorry.

726
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:57,777
Hiya, Dad.

727
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:01,447
- What brings you out here?
- Client's got a private jet at Butler.

728
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:04,158
- Hey, Buddy. How ya doing?
- Mr Wall Street!

729
01:00:04,242 --> 01:00:06,369
The bozos that keep us in the air!

730
01:00:06,452 --> 01:00:08,996
- Give us a hand.
- Do an honest day's work.

731
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:12,416
All right. Change the oil,
fill the tyres and park it out back.

732
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,627
This kid wanna buy the plane?

733
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:18,589
- You always light up when you see me.
- Don't start, all right?

734
01:00:18,673 --> 01:00:20,341
All right.

735
01:00:20,424 --> 01:00:22,677
So who peed in your Cheerios?

736
01:00:23,177 --> 01:00:25,596
Goddamn fare wars are killing us!

737
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,933
Management's gonna lay off
five of my men this week.

738
01:00:29,016 --> 01:00:30,893
l'm sorry about that.

739
01:00:30,977 --> 01:00:34,981
- So how much you need?
- l don't need anything. l'm doing great.

740
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:38,317
New client, new ball game.
Things are starting to happen.

741
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:41,195
Sure. Lots of guys at the track talk like that.

742
01:00:41,279 --> 01:00:46,117
How do you know you'll have any dough
next month? Jesus Christ, what is this?

743
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,077
lt's a dividend.

744
01:00:48,161 --> 01:00:51,122
l've borrowed at least five grand
over the years.

745
01:00:51,205 --> 01:00:54,667
Oh, stop it.
Put this towards your school loan.

746
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:59,589
Forget the loans. Look, Dad, things
are good and it's gonna stay that way.

747
01:00:59,672 --> 01:01:02,550
- Buy yourself a new suit.
- What do l need a suit for?

748
01:01:02,633 --> 01:01:05,928
l don't hobnob with the jet set.
l just fix their planes.

749
01:01:06,012 --> 01:01:11,225
Then get a decent bowling jacket, so you
don't look like the Roto-Rooter man.

750
01:01:11,309 --> 01:01:13,728
Come on, what's money for? Enjoy yourself.

751
01:01:13,811 --> 01:01:16,981
Money is a pain in the ass,
if you ask me. But thanks, kid.

752
01:01:17,064 --> 01:01:19,734
- How about dinner?
- Sure. Any night this week.

753
01:01:19,817 --> 01:01:22,153
OK. No, l'm sorry. This week's booked.

754
01:01:22,236 --> 01:01:26,574
- l'll check with my girl. l'll get back to you.
- You do that, Huckleberry.

755
01:01:26,657 --> 01:01:29,368
l gotta run. You stop smoking, you hear?

756
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:31,329
l'll talk at ya.

757
01:01:34,332 --> 01:01:36,000
Whoo! Oh!

758
01:01:39,921 --> 01:01:42,006
(Darien shrieks)

759
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:50,181
(man) lt's in both our interests to put
a safe distance between you and us.

760
01:01:50,264 --> 01:01:52,683
- You understand that, Mr Fox?
- Sure.

761
01:01:53,518 --> 01:01:57,480
This gives you limited power of attorney
for Mr Gekko's account.

762
01:01:57,563 --> 01:02:01,442
Every ticket you buy must be
marked "power of attorney".

763
01:02:01,526 --> 01:02:03,778
That means that you call the shots.

764
01:02:03,861 --> 01:02:08,491
Mr Gekko has no official knowledge
of what stocks you're buying. All right?

765
01:02:08,574 --> 01:02:11,285
Just sign it at the end, twice.

766
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:15,623
l never knew how poor l was
until l started making money.

767
01:02:15,706 --> 01:02:18,626
Your transactions will be
monitored by StockWatch.

768
01:02:19,126 --> 01:02:22,463
lf any trouble does arise,
you are on your own out there.

769
01:02:22,547 --> 01:02:24,841
The trail stops with you, understand?

770
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:28,928
Spread the buy orders over
different accounts, you won't get burnt.

771
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:31,681
l have friends that won't
mind making easy money.

772
01:02:31,764 --> 01:02:37,728
- (child shrieks)
- Rudy Gazoodi! How's my cutie?! Viens ici!

773
01:02:37,812 --> 01:02:41,983
(man) We need more votes for the
showdown, but don't wanna go public...

774
01:02:42,066 --> 01:02:45,319
- Bonjour, Monsieur Buddy.
- Bonjour, Monsieur Buddy.

775
01:02:45,403 --> 01:02:48,739
Oh! He speaks French already.

776
01:02:48,823 --> 01:02:51,492
Kid had the highest score in his lQ test.

777
01:02:51,576 --> 01:02:55,329
lt is so difficult to get into
a good nursery school now.

778
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:01,127
They even go to your home
to make sure you're acceptable.

779
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:03,880
That's it for you with the grown-ups.

780
01:03:03,963 --> 01:03:07,300
- Nicole, would you take him for a nap now?
- Viens, mon petit.

781
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:10,803
Give him a bath and put that
cute little black suit on him.

782
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:14,015
This is a contact at one of our offshore banks.

783
01:03:14,807 --> 01:03:17,768
On settlement day you'll open
an account for Mr Gekko...

784
01:03:17,852 --> 01:03:20,438
..under the name Geneva Roth Holding Corp.

785
01:03:20,521 --> 01:03:25,526
Then you'll wire-transfer the money
to this account in the Cayman lslands.

786
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:28,196
You're gonna make a lot of money, pal.

787
01:03:28,988 --> 01:03:32,074
The stakes are going up. No mistakes.

788
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:35,495
Piece of cake, Gordon.

789
01:03:50,843 --> 01:03:53,221
lf l could have anything,...

790
01:03:53,304 --> 01:03:55,806
..this would almost do.

791
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:58,309
Almost.

792
01:03:59,477 --> 01:04:02,146
How'd your conference go with Gordon?

793
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:07,193
lt went fine. We reached an agreement,
and decided to split up the world between us.

794
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:08,611
(Darien laughs)

795
01:04:08,694 --> 01:04:12,406
You have modest wants.
l like that in a man.

796
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:15,952
- What do you want?
- Let's see.

797
01:04:16,035 --> 01:04:20,414
A Turner. A perfect canary diamond.

798
01:04:20,498 --> 01:04:22,375
World peace.

799
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:24,335
The best of everything.

800
01:04:24,418 --> 01:04:26,254
Well, why stop at that?

801
01:04:26,337 --> 01:04:28,005
l don't.

802
01:04:43,604 --> 01:04:48,276
My client wants to buy a large block
of Teldar. He needs to spread it around.

803
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:51,821
l'll park some money in your account.
lf it hits, you get a big cut.

804
01:04:51,904 --> 01:04:55,783
l'm telling you, this is the easiest
money you've ever made.

805
01:04:56,284 --> 01:04:58,327
All right, Bud.

806
01:04:58,411 --> 01:05:00,496
Let's do it.

807
01:05:00,872 --> 01:05:02,957
We go way back, Harry.

808
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:07,378
You know, l-l-l've put a lot of money
into this firm over the years.

809
01:05:07,461 --> 01:05:10,923
- l brought in a lot of business.
- You've taken enough out, too.

810
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:16,345
- You should have something put aside.
- With the divorces l haven't had a chance.

811
01:05:16,429 --> 01:05:20,933
- The bridges are burned.
- When you fire me l'm finished. On the street.

812
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:24,353
- How do you think l feel about this?
- How do you think l feel?

813
01:05:24,437 --> 01:05:27,315
l've got responsibilities. l've got two kids...

814
01:05:27,398 --> 01:05:29,483
What's going on?

815
01:05:29,567 --> 01:05:33,321
Lynch is giving him the boot.
Not pulling his quota.

816
01:05:34,822 --> 01:05:37,325
We're all one trade away from humility.

817
01:05:37,408 --> 01:05:42,038
New report on GM and a conference call
in defence stock in my office, 7 am tomorrow.

818
01:05:42,121 --> 01:05:44,790
No RSVP required. Just be there.

819
01:05:45,416 --> 01:05:49,587
Now, on a more inspiring note,
the new office record...

820
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:54,675
..for a single month's gross commission
from the wealthy individual accounts...

821
01:05:54,759 --> 01:05:58,721
..goes to Bud Fox.
Shows cold calling does work, fellas.

822
01:05:58,846 --> 01:06:01,724
Way to go, Bud. Superjob. Come on up here.

823
01:06:01,807 --> 01:06:06,562
Bud, congrats. You just made my life
twice as hard around here.

824
01:06:10,691 --> 01:06:16,447
You're on a roll, kid. Enjoy it
while it lasts, cos it never does.

825
01:06:16,531 --> 01:06:19,242
Just kicking ass and taking names, Lou.

826
01:06:33,881 --> 01:06:36,384
Come along with me, Bud.

827
01:06:41,472 --> 01:06:43,558
This is yours now, Bud.

828
01:06:43,641 --> 01:06:46,185
Credenza. Tree. Windows.

829
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:50,523
And, significantly more attractive,
your private secretary Janet.

830
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:53,317
- Nice to meet you, Mr Fox.
- Hello, Janet.

831
01:06:54,485 --> 01:06:58,364
Well, l don't really know what to say.
Thank you, Mr Lynch.

832
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:00,116
No, l thank you, Bud.

833
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:04,328
The minute l laid my eyes on you
l knew that you had what it takes.

834
01:07:04,537 --> 01:07:07,456
Now you can focus on the big-ticket retail.

835
01:07:08,207 --> 01:07:11,335
Oh, this is very nice. This is very nice.

836
01:07:11,669 --> 01:07:14,755
So what is it? Mr Cocksucker now?

837
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:20,469
Everybody hates the Upper East Side.
They wanna live on the West Side.

838
01:07:20,553 --> 01:07:25,016
But when it's resale time
the East Side moves all the time.

839
01:07:25,099 --> 01:07:28,644
What have you got on the West Side?
Sean and Madonna?! Trust me.

840
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:33,733
Massage, sauna, Jacuzzi... tanning salon.

841
01:07:35,276 --> 01:07:37,904
Best schools in the city.

842
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:42,700
A cute young boy like you gotta think
of a future lady friend in your life...

843
01:07:42,783 --> 01:07:45,369
..when you've finished wolfing around.

844
01:07:45,453 --> 01:07:47,538
Course, l'm taken.

845
01:07:47,622 --> 01:07:49,707
Oak strip floors.

846
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:52,001
My husband can get you a 10% mortgage.

847
01:07:52,084 --> 01:07:56,005
l would do it myself, except
l'm into four other deals right now.

848
01:07:56,547 --> 01:08:02,011
So, l got a four o'clock and a five. One's an
all-cash type. Monique something or other.

849
01:08:02,762 --> 01:08:07,600
Look, maybe you'd like to see something
cheaper that l got on First Avenue?

850
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:11,229
Honey, the meter's running. Anybody home?

851
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:15,483
All right. Offer 950.

852
01:08:18,653 --> 01:08:21,113
l got something over on Sutton Place.

853
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:24,909
lt's a million and a half,
but now we're talking duplex.

854
01:08:24,992 --> 01:08:26,536
No.

855
01:08:26,744 --> 01:08:29,455
This is it. This is home.

856
01:08:30,957 --> 01:08:34,544
(** "This Must Be the Place"
by Talking Heads)

857
01:08:58,776 --> 01:09:01,362
That's enough gold over there.

858
01:09:22,633 --> 01:09:24,719
Like it?

859
01:09:26,387 --> 01:09:31,976
l'm having House & Garden come up next
week to photograph it before it gets lived in.

860
01:09:32,059 --> 01:09:33,060
Do you mind?

861
01:09:34,437 --> 01:09:37,356
Hey! Jerry! Come at me. Whaddaya got?

862
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,984
No, no. 37 1/2.

863
01:09:40,067 --> 01:09:44,989
Convert the bonds and check the price
in Tokyo at eight o'clock your time. Right.

864
01:10:07,762 --> 01:10:10,056
l'm spilling everything.

865
01:10:13,768 --> 01:10:16,270
(** aria from "Rigoletto"playing on stereo)

866
01:10:29,367 --> 01:10:31,994
(Bud tries to sing along in mock ltalian)

867
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:43,422
lsn't it perfect?

868
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:46,175
lt's too perfect.

869
01:10:46,509 --> 01:10:48,511
Let's not even eat.

870
01:10:48,594 --> 01:10:51,389
Let's just watch it... think about it.

871
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:41,147
Who am l?

872
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,326
Bud, come to bed.

873
01:11:58,456 --> 01:12:00,291
One million six. Seven.

874
01:12:00,374 --> 01:12:04,670
On my left now.
Against you, 1,800,000.

875
01:12:04,754 --> 01:12:08,549
1,900,000. New bidder this side.
$2m here now.

876
01:12:08,633 --> 01:12:12,386
Not yours. At $2,100,000. $2,100,000.

877
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:15,848
Fair warning, then.
Selling for $2,100,000. All done.

878
01:12:15,932 --> 01:12:18,392
For you, sir. $2,100,000.

879
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:21,938
Whaddaya say we get a suite at the Carlyle?

880
01:12:22,021 --> 01:12:25,900
Champagne, caviar...?
Celebrate just like old times?

881
01:12:25,983 --> 01:12:28,861
Come on, Gordon. Those days are over.

882
01:12:28,945 --> 01:12:31,906
Well, you can't blame me for trying.

883
01:12:31,989 --> 01:12:35,326
You're as beautiful as
that painting l just bought.

884
01:12:36,202 --> 01:12:41,165
Sunshine, what's wrong?
l think you got a bad case of puppy love.

885
01:12:41,249 --> 01:12:43,668
l think l'm falling for Bud.

886
01:12:44,168 --> 01:12:47,880
Don't fall too far. He hasn't been
around the block yet. You have.

887
01:12:49,173 --> 01:12:53,219
- Told him about us?
- No! Are you crazy?

888
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:57,515
- l don't want him to ever know, understand?
- Mum is the word.

889
01:12:59,684 --> 01:13:01,853
You and l are the same, Darien.

890
01:13:01,936 --> 01:13:06,566
We are smart enough not to buy
into the oldest myth running - love.

891
01:13:07,191 --> 01:13:11,696
Fiction created by people to keep
them from jumping out of windows.

892
01:13:11,779 --> 01:13:16,659
You know, sometimes l miss you, Gordon.
You're really twisted.

893
01:13:19,245 --> 01:13:21,330
For chrissake, Jack, it's easy!

894
01:13:21,414 --> 01:13:25,585
On settlement day you endorse a cheque
to Blue Horseshoe Trading Company.

895
01:13:25,668 --> 01:13:27,753
Then l'll send you your cut.

896
01:13:28,588 --> 01:13:32,341
What? No, that's the bottom line.
Nobody gets hurt.

897
01:13:32,925 --> 01:13:35,011
What the fuck is wrong with you?

898
01:13:35,094 --> 01:13:39,557
lt's so bad, even the liars are complaining.
But not you. You're making big money.

899
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,893
- What's the bottom line?
- Hey, look!

900
01:13:41,976 --> 01:13:46,063
l am sick and tired of playing
wet nurse to you!

901
01:13:46,147 --> 01:13:51,152
- Will you do your own homework, Marv!
- What an asshole, man!

902
01:13:51,736 --> 01:13:53,821
That's a shame.

903
01:13:56,616 --> 01:14:01,787
Yeah, Frank. Work 500,000 shares Teldar
with a limit of 26. New account.

904
01:14:01,871 --> 01:14:03,956
Don't fuck it up.

905
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:07,793
- How's Teldar doing?
- Back again?

906
01:14:07,877 --> 01:14:11,797
- l've got a real appetite.
- Bring it five to a half. 2,000 up.

907
01:14:11,881 --> 01:14:16,010
- l gotta buy stock. What's offered at a half?
- What are we looking at?

908
01:14:16,093 --> 01:14:18,554
- Make me an offer on 80.
- 80,000 at a half.

909
01:14:18,638 --> 01:14:20,306
l'll take it.

910
01:14:46,165 --> 01:14:50,127
Your company, ladies and gentlemen,
is under siege from Gordon Gekko.

911
01:14:50,211 --> 01:14:55,508
Teldar Paper is now leveraged to the hilt,
like some piss-poor South American country!

912
01:14:55,758 --> 01:15:01,389
l strongly recommend you to see through
Mr Gekko's shameless intention here...

913
01:15:01,472 --> 01:15:06,227
..to strip this company,
and severely penalise the stockholders.

914
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:09,438
l strongly recommend you
to reject his tender...

915
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:14,861
..by voting for management's
restructuring of the stock.

916
01:15:23,786 --> 01:15:27,707
Well, l appreciate the opportunity
you're giving me, Mr Cromwell,...

917
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:31,919
..as the single largest shareholder
in Teldar Paper, to speak.

918
01:15:32,003 --> 01:15:33,880
(laughter)

919
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:40,219
We are not here to indulge in fantasy,
but in political and economic reality.

920
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:46,767
America... America
has become a second-rate power.

921
01:15:48,186 --> 01:15:53,691
lts trade deficit and its fiscal deficit
are at nightmare proportions.

922
01:15:54,942 --> 01:15:59,322
ln the days of the free market, when
our country was a top industrial power,...

923
01:15:59,489 --> 01:16:02,825
..there was accountability to the stockholder.

924
01:16:03,409 --> 01:16:08,998
The Carnegies, the Mellons, the men
that built this great empire, made sure of it...

925
01:16:09,081 --> 01:16:11,709
..because it was their money at stake.

926
01:16:11,918 --> 01:16:15,963
Today, management
has no stake in the company!

927
01:16:17,298 --> 01:16:22,470
All together, these men sitting up here
own less than 3% of the company.

928
01:16:22,553 --> 01:16:26,474
And where does Mr Cromwell
put his $1,000,000 salary?

929
01:16:26,557 --> 01:16:30,311
Not in Teldar stock. He owns less than 1%.

930
01:16:30,394 --> 01:16:34,482
You own the company.
That's right, you, the stockholder.

931
01:16:34,565 --> 01:16:38,945
And you are all being royally
screwed over by these bureaucrats,...

932
01:16:39,028 --> 01:16:45,034
..with their steak lunches, their fishing trips,
their corporate jets and golden parachutes.

933
01:16:45,117 --> 01:16:47,662
This is an outrage! You're out of line, Gekko!

934
01:16:47,745 --> 01:16:53,668
Teldar Paper, Mr Cromwell,
has 33 different vice presidents,...

935
01:16:54,001 --> 01:16:58,172
..each earning over $200,000 a year.

936
01:16:59,632 --> 01:17:05,054
Now, l have spent the last two months
analysing what all these guys do.

937
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:08,432
- And l still can't figure it out.
- (laughter)

938
01:17:08,516 --> 01:17:14,480
One thing l do know is that
our paper company lost $110m last year.

939
01:17:14,564 --> 01:17:20,319
And l'll bet half of that was spent in all the
paperwork between all these vice presidents!

940
01:17:22,405 --> 01:17:25,950
The new law of evolution
in corporate America...

941
01:17:26,033 --> 01:17:29,996
..seems to be... survival of the unfittest.

942
01:17:31,247 --> 01:17:35,459
Well, in my book you either do it right,
or you get eliminated.

943
01:17:37,837 --> 01:17:43,134
ln the last seven deals that l have been
involved with there were 2.5m stockholders...

944
01:17:43,217 --> 01:17:47,722
..who have made a pre-tax profit
of $12 billion.

945
01:17:47,805 --> 01:17:48,890
(applause)

946
01:17:48,973 --> 01:17:50,183
Thank you.

947
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:55,563
l am not a destroyer of companies.

948
01:17:55,646 --> 01:17:58,149
l am a liberator of them!

949
01:18:00,693 --> 01:18:06,824
The point is, ladies and gentlemen,
that greed, for lack of a better word,...

950
01:18:06,908 --> 01:18:08,784
..is good.

951
01:18:08,868 --> 01:18:12,121
Greed is right. Greed works.

952
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:19,837
Greed clarifies, cuts through and captures
the essence of the evolutionary spirit.

953
01:18:19,921 --> 01:18:27,011
Greed, in all of its forms - greed for life,
for money, for love, knowledge -

954
01:18:27,094 --> 01:18:29,889
..has marked the upward surge of mankind.

955
01:18:29,972 --> 01:18:36,604
And greed, you mark my words,
will not only save Teldar Paper,...

956
01:18:36,687 --> 01:18:40,817
..but that other malfunctioning
corporation called the USA.

957
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:43,194
Thank you very much.

958
01:18:50,618 --> 01:18:53,329
** Fly me to the moon

959
01:18:53,412 --> 01:18:58,167
** Let me play among the stars

960
01:18:58,709 --> 01:19:00,962
Buy me 20 June eurodollar CDs,...

961
01:19:01,045 --> 01:19:06,050
..20 March gold and sell 10 September
Deutschmarks. Right. Talk at ya, babe.

962
01:19:07,468 --> 01:19:13,057
Ah, Buddy, Buddy, l hate to tell you this,
but you are a genius!

963
01:19:13,558 --> 01:19:15,893
Darien! Lightning has struck.

964
01:19:15,977 --> 01:19:19,522
The light bulb has been invented.
Bluestar Airlines.

965
01:19:19,605 --> 01:19:22,775
Edison, da Vinci, Einstein.
They're all watching me.

966
01:19:22,859 --> 01:19:25,027
Ever hear of the 60-hour work week?

967
01:19:25,111 --> 01:19:29,282
You've gotta go to work soon. l'm getting
psychotic from a lack of REM sleep.

968
01:19:29,365 --> 01:19:31,742
l'm not gonna broker the rest of my life.

969
01:19:31,826 --> 01:19:37,039
l am gonna be a giant, an entrepreneur
in the ltalian 16th-century sense of the word.

970
01:19:37,123 --> 01:19:41,043
A mover, a shaker.
l'm shooting for the stars, Darien.

971
01:19:41,127 --> 01:19:43,713
You're coming along for the ride.

972
01:19:46,007 --> 01:19:49,093
Bluestar is an unpolished gem, Gordon.

973
01:19:49,343 --> 01:19:53,472
A half-assed management being decimated
by a price war they cannot win.

974
01:19:53,556 --> 01:19:56,767
But the gates at La Guardia alone
can bail us out.

975
01:19:56,851 --> 01:20:01,063
lf it's worth a dime, it's worth 10 bucks
a share. They're ripe to fall!

976
01:20:01,147 --> 01:20:03,065
Mixed emotions, Buddy.

977
01:20:03,149 --> 01:20:08,154
Like Larry Wildman going off
a cliff... in my new Maserati!

978
01:20:09,739 --> 01:20:13,284
Guys like me have had their asses hung
in a sling with the airlines!

979
01:20:13,367 --> 01:20:18,122
- Fuel could go up. Unions are killers.
- Yeah, but aren't you forgetting one thing?

980
01:20:18,206 --> 01:20:23,419
Capital reserves. This company has
75 million cash in an overfunded pension.

981
01:20:23,503 --> 01:20:25,755
That buys us a lot of credibility.

982
01:20:25,838 --> 01:20:29,217
And the beauty is, you already
own close to 2% of this sucker.

983
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:34,180
The insurance people are balking on the
logging trucks. What do you want to do?

984
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:38,100
Tell those assholes
we'll self-insure if they don't write it.

985
01:20:38,184 --> 01:20:42,480
l can't believe we can fire half
the management and nothing changes!

986
01:20:42,563 --> 01:20:44,440
(deep sigh)

987
01:20:45,316 --> 01:20:49,946
Gordon, what l want,
and l've never asked you for anything,...

988
01:20:50,029 --> 01:20:52,740
..is to be your copilot on this one.

989
01:20:53,366 --> 01:20:58,454
l wanna take this airline, turn it around and
make it work. lt's gonna make us a fortune.

990
01:21:01,123 --> 01:21:06,546
l got a stockbroker who wants an airline. lt'll
take two years to turn Teldar Paper around.

991
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:10,925
What do l need a dink airline for? l'm up
to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake!

992
01:21:11,175 --> 01:21:15,429
l've worked at Bluestar. l know my way
around. l have friends there, inside.

993
01:21:16,055 --> 01:21:18,140
What do you mean?

994
01:21:18,224 --> 01:21:22,770
The three unions.
lt's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget.

995
01:21:22,854 --> 01:21:27,984
The hourly cost of a flight crew is 850
an hour. That's the real hidden value, GG.

996
01:21:28,067 --> 01:21:32,446
lf you can negotiate that out,
get a crew down to 350, 400 an hour,...

997
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:35,700
..this airline'll be the hottest thing
since Texas Air.

998
01:21:35,825 --> 01:21:40,621
- What makes you think you can?
- l can talk to these people. They trust me.

999
01:21:40,705 --> 01:21:43,624
My father can be a big help in getting cuts.

1000
01:21:50,131 --> 01:21:54,468
All right. Susan, get Buckingham
on the phone. Tell him to look into it.

1001
01:21:55,178 --> 01:21:57,805
So the falcon's heard the falconer, huh?

1002
01:22:13,154 --> 01:22:15,031
- Hi, Dad.
- Sorry l'm late.

1003
01:22:15,114 --> 01:22:17,700
That's OK. Overdressed as usual.

1004
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:23,789
Come on in. Everybody's here.
l couldn't start the show without you.

1005
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:27,418
Well, l'll be a lousy Republican!

1006
01:22:27,502 --> 01:22:31,714
l decorate for Democrats, too.
Lots of them. l'm Darien Taylor.

1007
01:22:31,797 --> 01:22:34,759
- Bud's told me all about you.
- Don't believe a word.

1008
01:22:34,842 --> 01:22:37,303
l never beat him or locked him in a closet.

1009
01:22:37,386 --> 01:22:40,014
- l forgot about the closet.
- He turned out OK.

1010
01:22:40,097 --> 01:22:43,100
Bud's a born liar, otherwise he's a good kid.

1011
01:22:43,184 --> 01:22:47,021
l hope you come here more often,
under less formal circumstances.

1012
01:22:47,104 --> 01:22:48,648
Thank you.

1013
01:22:48,731 --> 01:22:51,734
- Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore.
- Sure. How are ya?

1014
01:22:51,818 --> 01:22:55,363
Pilots' union.
Toni Carpenter, flight attendants'.

1015
01:22:55,446 --> 01:22:57,532
l'd like you to meet Mr Gekko.

1016
01:22:57,615 --> 01:22:59,826
Mr Fox, pleasure to meet you.

1017
01:23:00,076 --> 01:23:02,119
His attorney, Mr Salt.

1018
01:23:02,203 --> 01:23:05,665
l'd be proud to have a son like Buddy.
Got a hell of a career in front of him.

1019
01:23:05,748 --> 01:23:10,628
l'm glad you think so. l thought this was
informal. What's your attorney doing here?

1020
01:23:10,711 --> 01:23:14,215
Harold, you don't mind walking
around the block, do you?

1021
01:23:14,298 --> 01:23:16,884
- Of course.
- l'll take that.

1022
01:23:16,968 --> 01:23:18,678
No offence.

1023
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:20,847
None taken.

1024
01:23:25,643 --> 01:23:28,437
That's OK, Gordon. Bud does it all the time.

1025
01:23:30,106 --> 01:23:35,778
(Gekko) Look, l got no illusions about
winning a popularity contest with any of you.

1026
01:23:36,445 --> 01:23:38,364
l got roasted the other night.

1027
01:23:38,447 --> 01:23:43,661
A friend asked "Why are we honouring this
man? Did we run out of human beings?"

1028
01:23:44,412 --> 01:23:48,541
lt's not always the most popular guy
who gets the job done.

1029
01:23:51,752 --> 01:23:55,423
You've got losses of $20-30 million,
dividends cut to zero,...

1030
01:23:55,506 --> 01:23:58,467
..and you're being squeezed
to death by the majors.

1031
01:23:58,551 --> 01:24:04,515
The management may not be the worst scum,
but they put you on this kamikaze course,...

1032
01:24:04,599 --> 01:24:09,145
..and pretty soon everybody
is gonna be scrambling for parachutes.

1033
01:24:09,228 --> 01:24:11,772
Only there's not enough to go around.

1034
01:24:11,856 --> 01:24:14,775
Management has them. You don't.

1035
01:24:16,736 --> 01:24:20,323
lf they throw Bluestar to Chapter 11,
which l think they will,...

1036
01:24:20,406 --> 01:24:26,037
..they'll use the bankruptcy laws to break
your unions, and throw you off the property.

1037
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:31,125
Oh, come on! With all due respect, what's
to prevent you from doing the same thing?

1038
01:24:31,209 --> 01:24:33,503
Cos l got a way around all this,...

1039
01:24:33,586 --> 01:24:38,090
..where we can all make money
and make the airline profitable.

1040
01:24:38,466 --> 01:24:41,177
So what do you say we cut to the chase?

1041
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:49,143
l'm asking for a modest 20% across-the-board
wage cut, and seven more hours a month.

1042
01:24:50,436 --> 01:24:52,772
What kind of time frame?

1043
01:24:52,855 --> 01:24:56,234
A year. lf we're still losing money,
the reduction stands.

1044
01:24:56,317 --> 01:25:01,197
lf we're in the black, l'll return part of the
givebacks, pay goes back to current levels,...

1045
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:07,245
..and we initiate an employee
profit-sharing programme with stock.

1046
01:25:07,328 --> 01:25:11,040
- You'll own part of the airline.
- Will you put it in writing?

1047
01:25:11,123 --> 01:25:14,502
l'll have a letter of agreement
drafted up in two days.

1048
01:25:14,585 --> 01:25:18,840
What's your marketing strategy?
How will you return us to profitability?

1049
01:25:18,923 --> 01:25:22,301
Why don't l give Buddy an opportunity
to answer that? Buddy?

1050
01:25:22,385 --> 01:25:24,512
Thank you, Gordon.

1051
01:25:24,595 --> 01:25:28,266
First, l want you all to know
that my door will always be open,...

1052
01:25:28,349 --> 01:25:32,478
..because l know from my dad
it's you guys that keep Bluestar flying.

1053
01:25:32,562 --> 01:25:36,399
What l've come up with here
is a basic three-point plan.

1054
01:25:36,482 --> 01:25:41,070
One: we modernise. Our computer
software is dogshit. We update it.

1055
01:25:41,154 --> 01:25:43,948
We squeeze every dollar
out of each mile flown.

1056
01:25:44,031 --> 01:25:47,785
Don't sell a seat to a guy for 79 bucks
when he's willing to pay 379.

1057
01:25:47,869 --> 01:25:54,125
Effective inventory management
will increase our load factor by 5-20%.

1058
01:25:54,208 --> 01:25:58,462
That translates to approximately
$50-200 million in revenues.

1059
01:25:58,754 --> 01:26:02,008
The point being,
we can beat the majors at a price war.

1060
01:26:02,091 --> 01:26:06,387
Two: advertising. More, and aggressive.
We attack the majors.

1061
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:10,933
Three: expansion. We expand our hubs
to Atlanta, North Carolina and St Louis.

1062
01:26:11,017 --> 01:26:14,061
And we reorganise all
of our feeder schedules.

1063
01:26:14,145 --> 01:26:17,982
We gotta think big, guys.
We're going after the majors.

1064
01:26:19,901 --> 01:26:23,446
Well, cards on the table, guys.
What do you say?

1065
01:26:23,529 --> 01:26:28,075
Well, if you mean what you say,
l think we're probably in the ballpark.

1066
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:31,496
- l guess l can take it to my people.
- Good.

1067
01:26:31,579 --> 01:26:35,291
You've sketched broad strokes.
l'd like to see the fine print.

1068
01:26:35,374 --> 01:26:37,502
But l like what l hear so far.

1069
01:26:37,585 --> 01:26:39,879
(Carl laughs)

1070
01:26:42,423 --> 01:26:48,304
l guess if a man lives long enough he gets
to see everything, and l do mean everything.

1071
01:26:48,387 --> 01:26:52,058
What else you got
in your bag of tricks, Mr Gekko?

1072
01:26:53,267 --> 01:26:59,357
Frankly, Carl, l can't see giving much more,
but, if you have any suggestions, l'll listen.

1073
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:02,527
"There came into Egypt
a Pharaoh who did not know."

1074
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:06,531
- l beg your pardon. ls that a proverb?
- No, a prophecy.

1075
01:27:06,614 --> 01:27:09,700
The rich have been doing it
to the poor since time began.

1076
01:27:09,784 --> 01:27:13,913
The only difference is
the Egyptians didn't allow unions.

1077
01:27:13,996 --> 01:27:16,457
l know what this guy's all about - greed.

1078
01:27:16,541 --> 01:27:21,504
He don't care about Bluestar or the unions.
He's in for the buck. He don't take prisoners.

1079
01:27:21,879 --> 01:27:23,214
Wait a minute, Dad.

1080
01:27:23,297 --> 01:27:27,301
Sure. What's worth doing
is worth doing for money.

1081
01:27:27,385 --> 01:27:32,390
lt's a bad bargain if nobody gains.
And if we do this deal, everybody gains.

1082
01:27:32,473 --> 01:27:37,186
Course, my son worked as a baggage handler
and freight loader for three summers.

1083
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:40,565
With those qualifications,
he can run an airline!

1084
01:27:40,815 --> 01:27:43,359
Fine. Stay with the present management...

1085
01:27:43,442 --> 01:27:47,113
..dedicated to running you and
your airline into the ground.

1086
01:27:47,405 --> 01:27:52,910
That "scum" built the company up with one
plane and made something out of nothing.

1087
01:27:52,994 --> 01:27:58,833
lf that's a scum, l'll take it over a rat any
day. You know where l stand. Good night, all.

1088
01:28:05,089 --> 01:28:07,175
Excuse me.

1089
01:28:10,219 --> 01:28:15,433
Congratulations, Dad! You did a greatjob
embarrassing me, not to mention yourself!

1090
01:28:15,725 --> 01:28:19,479
Save the "workers unite" speech.
l heard it too much growing up!

1091
01:28:19,562 --> 01:28:22,815
- Oh, yeah?
- You'll get axed. No two ways about it.

1092
01:28:22,899 --> 01:28:26,486
You and the whole shitty airline
are going down the tubes!

1093
01:28:26,569 --> 01:28:30,072
And if it isn't Gekko,
it's gonna be some other killer!

1094
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:40,625
He's using you, kid. He's got your prick
in his pocket, but you're too blind to see it.

1095
01:28:40,708 --> 01:28:43,252
No. l see ajealous old machinist...

1096
01:28:43,336 --> 01:28:47,215
..who can't stand the fact that his son's
more successful than he is!

1097
01:28:47,298 --> 01:28:52,887
What you see is a guy who never measured
a man's success by the size of his wallet!

1098
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:58,518
That's because you never had the guts to go
out into the world and stake your own claim!

1099
01:29:07,276 --> 01:29:12,281
Boy, if that's the way you feel,
l must've done a really lousy job as a father.

1100
01:29:16,994 --> 01:29:19,288
As far as being axed, l'm still around,...

1101
01:29:19,372 --> 01:29:22,959
..and l have a responsibility
to the union membership l represent.

1102
01:29:23,042 --> 01:29:27,129
Your responsibility is to present the facts,
not opinions, to your men.

1103
01:29:27,213 --> 01:29:30,424
You'll destroy their lives.
Let them decide for themselves.

1104
01:29:30,508 --> 01:29:34,887
My men will want to know what's
going on, and l won't lie to them!

1105
01:29:34,971 --> 01:29:37,807
Oh, yeah, your men! Your fuckin' men!

1106
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:41,185
All my life your men have
been able to count on you!

1107
01:29:41,269 --> 01:29:43,938
Why have you never been there for me?!

1108
01:29:44,772 --> 01:29:46,649
What if you're wrong?

1109
01:29:46,732 --> 01:29:52,613
What if one day the sun didn't rise in the
east, and for once your compass was off?

1110
01:29:52,697 --> 01:29:56,284
Would you be willing to wreck
your men's future? My future?

1111
01:29:56,367 --> 01:30:01,747
Dad, think for a change. Be practical.
l'm asking you. l'm fuckin' begging you!

1112
01:30:02,999 --> 01:30:06,419
l don't go to sleep with no whore
and l don't wake up with no whore.

1113
01:30:06,502 --> 01:30:10,339
That's how l live with myself.
l don't know how you do it.

1114
01:30:10,423 --> 01:30:15,469
l hope l'm wrong about this guy...
but l'll let the men decide for themselves.

1115
01:30:15,553 --> 01:30:17,847
That much l promise you.

1116
01:30:43,915 --> 01:30:48,127
You should look at this, Chief.
A guy at Jackson Steinem...

1117
01:30:48,211 --> 01:30:52,924
..buying large chunks of Teldar Paper
for an offshore account.

1118
01:30:53,049 --> 01:30:54,926
(knock at door)

1119
01:30:57,929 --> 01:31:00,097
So, what's the problema?

1120
01:31:00,181 --> 01:31:03,309
- Do you know what the fuck the problem is?
- What?

1121
01:31:03,976 --> 01:31:06,521
- You don't know?
- l don't know.

1122
01:31:06,604 --> 01:31:10,441
l get a strange call from the SEC.
They asked to see my records.

1123
01:31:10,525 --> 01:31:14,278
- This is heavy, Bud.
- Hey, hey, hey, relax! Relax, Roger.

1124
01:31:15,488 --> 01:31:18,616
You're 82M in the account numbers
and l'm the invisible man.

1125
01:31:18,699 --> 01:31:20,993
Well, that's good for you, Bud.

1126
01:31:21,077 --> 01:31:25,790
They're always looking for red flags.
Gekko's always getting checked by 'em.

1127
01:31:25,873 --> 01:31:28,584
They never come up with anything, Rog.

1128
01:31:30,461 --> 01:31:33,881
Hey... we're invulnerable on this one.

1129
01:31:34,757 --> 01:31:37,510
l just wanna slow down, Bud.

1130
01:31:37,593 --> 01:31:39,095
All right?

1131
01:31:39,178 --> 01:31:44,308
No more lunches, no calls, all right?
We suspend our business, all right?

1132
01:31:44,392 --> 01:31:47,103
Whatever you want, Rog. lt's cool.

1133
01:31:47,436 --> 01:31:50,940
Excuse me. Hey, Rog, can you come
back in? Bring the cost report.

1134
01:31:51,023 --> 01:31:53,109
We're starting again.

1135
01:31:55,194 --> 01:31:59,323
Gekko's asked us into the Bluestar deal.
We're reviewing timetables.

1136
01:31:59,407 --> 01:32:03,202
- You wanna come?
- He didn't tell me about that.

1137
01:32:03,286 --> 01:32:08,916
You're only the president of the company.
What the hell do you know anyway, right?

1138
01:32:18,885 --> 01:32:21,721
Guys, new chief of Bluestar - Bud Fox.

1139
01:32:21,804 --> 01:32:23,681
- Hi.
- Hello, Bud.

1140
01:32:23,764 --> 01:32:26,726
Guys, what's the problem? lt's time to kill.

1141
01:32:27,602 --> 01:32:32,356
Gekko's got 12% of the stock and climbing.
Plus he's got the unions in his back pocket.

1142
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:37,069
Everybody knows the stock's in play.
By next week the street will own Bluestar.

1143
01:32:37,153 --> 01:32:39,238
ls the bank financing in place?

1144
01:32:39,447 --> 01:32:44,160
Or are we gonna sit around and have
more of these ridiculous meetings?

1145
01:32:44,243 --> 01:32:49,499
Our firm committed weeks ago 25%
of the total long-term debt structure.

1146
01:32:49,665 --> 01:32:53,377
Unless you guys sign
this piece of paper right now,...

1147
01:32:53,461 --> 01:32:56,839
..l'm gonna pull and go to
another bank for the 75.

1148
01:32:57,465 --> 01:33:03,721
Look, we've got 30 banks ready to participate
in a four-year revolving credit line.

1149
01:33:03,846 --> 01:33:10,770
We must have your assurance you will pay
back most of the loan in the first 12 months.

1150
01:33:11,312 --> 01:33:16,776
The only way we can see this happening
is liquidating the hangars and the planes.

1151
01:33:16,859 --> 01:33:20,738
Can you people guarantee
the liquidation of Bluestar?

1152
01:33:20,822 --> 01:33:22,949
Guarantee? No sweat!

1153
01:33:23,032 --> 01:33:26,911
We got the Bleezburgs lined up
to build condos where the hangars are.

1154
01:33:26,994 --> 01:33:30,957
We lay the airplanes off to the Mexicans,
who are dumb enough to buy 'em!

1155
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:35,211
And l got the Texas boys drooling
at my kneecaps for the routes and slots.

1156
01:33:35,294 --> 01:33:37,839
What's your problem? lt's done!

1157
01:33:37,922 --> 01:33:41,717
Here's the price tags
on the 737s, gates, hangars, routes.

1158
01:33:41,801 --> 01:33:45,012
We got it nailed right down
to the typewriters.

1159
01:33:45,096 --> 01:33:48,140
The beauty of this deal
is the overfunded pension.

1160
01:33:48,224 --> 01:33:51,602
Gekko makes $75m there.

1161
01:33:51,978 --> 01:33:56,399
50 million buys him the minimum
annuities for 6,000 employees,...

1162
01:33:56,482 --> 01:34:03,698
..and he walks away with the rest.
l figure he'll make... He'll clear $60-70m.

1163
01:34:03,781 --> 01:34:06,284
Not bad for a month's work.

1164
01:34:07,535 --> 01:34:10,246
Your boy really did his homework, Fox.

1165
01:34:10,329 --> 01:34:15,626
And you'll have the shortest executive
career since that Pope that got poisoned.

1166
01:34:15,710 --> 01:34:20,006
Now he'll really start believing
he's Gekko the Great.

1167
01:34:21,382 --> 01:34:24,385
- He'd like to change that appointment.
- Hold this.

1168
01:34:24,468 --> 01:34:26,846
Bud, you can't go in! He's in a meeting!

1169
01:34:26,929 --> 01:34:30,474
Alex has come up with
an ingenious way for us to...

1170
01:34:32,101 --> 01:34:34,812
l didn't know we had a meeting today, sport.

1171
01:34:34,896 --> 01:34:38,065
l didn't, either.
l think we should talk, Gordon.

1172
01:34:39,275 --> 01:34:44,322
- Would you excuse us for a second?
- Won't you come this way, gentlemen?

1173
01:34:44,405 --> 01:34:46,491
Thank you, Alex.

1174
01:34:48,618 --> 01:34:50,119
What do you want?

1175
01:34:50,203 --> 01:34:53,372
l just found out about
the garage sale at Bluestar.

1176
01:34:53,456 --> 01:34:57,335
Why?!

1177
01:34:57,418 --> 01:35:01,130
Last night l was reading Rudy
Winnie-the-Pooh and the Honey Pot.

1178
01:35:01,214 --> 01:35:07,053
You know what happened? He stuck his nose
in the pot once too often, and he got stuck.

1179
01:35:07,762 --> 01:35:10,181
Maybe you oughta read him Pinocchio.

1180
01:35:10,264 --> 01:35:14,685
l thought you were gonna turn
Bluestar around, not upside down!

1181
01:35:14,769 --> 01:35:19,023
- You fuckin' used me!
- You're walking around blind without a cane.

1182
01:35:19,106 --> 01:35:21,901
A fool and his money are lucky to even meet.

1183
01:35:21,984 --> 01:35:26,864
- Why do you need to wreck this company?
- Because it's wreckable, all right?!

1184
01:35:26,948 --> 01:35:29,826
l took another look. l changed my mind.

1185
01:35:29,909 --> 01:35:32,870
lf they lose theirjobs,
they got nowhere to go!

1186
01:35:32,954 --> 01:35:36,666
My father has worked there for 24 years!
l gave him my word!

1187
01:35:36,749 --> 01:35:39,252
lt's all about bucks, kid.

1188
01:35:39,794 --> 01:35:42,296
The rest is conversation.

1189
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:44,674
Buddy, you'll still be president.

1190
01:35:44,757 --> 01:35:48,052
When the time comes,
you'll parachute out a rich man.

1191
01:35:48,135 --> 01:35:52,181
With the money you'll make,
your dad's never got to work again.

1192
01:35:53,015 --> 01:35:56,394
So tell me, Gordon,
when does it all end, huh?

1193
01:35:56,477 --> 01:35:59,897
How many yachts can you water-ski behind?
How much is enough?

1194
01:35:59,981 --> 01:36:03,526
lt's not a question of enough, pal.
lt's a zero-sum game.

1195
01:36:03,609 --> 01:36:06,487
Somebody wins, somebody loses.

1196
01:36:06,571 --> 01:36:10,533
Money itself isn't lost or made,
it's simply transferred...

1197
01:36:10,616 --> 01:36:14,162
..from one perception to another, like magic.

1198
01:36:15,121 --> 01:36:19,041
This painting here.
l bought it ten years ago for $60,000.

1199
01:36:19,125 --> 01:36:23,629
l could sell it today for six hundred.
The illusion has become real.

1200
01:36:23,713 --> 01:36:27,967
And the more real it becomes,
the more desperate they want it.

1201
01:36:29,010 --> 01:36:31,512
Capitalism at its finest.

1202
01:36:32,013 --> 01:36:34,515
How much is enough, Gordon?

1203
01:36:37,018 --> 01:36:43,399
The richest 1% of this country owns half
our country's wealth. Five trillion dollars.

1204
01:36:43,483 --> 01:36:47,487
One third comes from hard work,
two thirds from inheritance,...

1205
01:36:47,570 --> 01:36:51,240
..interest on interest accumulating
to widows and idiot sons,...

1206
01:36:51,324 --> 01:36:54,869
..and what l do:
stock and real-estate speculation.

1207
01:36:55,536 --> 01:36:57,205
lt's bullshit.

1208
01:36:57,288 --> 01:37:01,584
You got 90% of the American public
with little or no net worth.

1209
01:37:01,667 --> 01:37:03,753
l create nothing.

1210
01:37:04,712 --> 01:37:06,797
l own.

1211
01:37:07,507 --> 01:37:09,425
We make the rules, pal.

1212
01:37:09,509 --> 01:37:14,347
The news, war, peace, famine, upheaval,
the price of a paperclip.

1213
01:37:14,430 --> 01:37:19,477
We pick that rabbit out of the hat while
everybody wonders how the hell we did it.

1214
01:37:20,436 --> 01:37:25,316
You're not naive enough to think we're
living in a democracy, are you, Buddy?

1215
01:37:25,399 --> 01:37:29,278
lt's the free market, and you're part of it.

1216
01:37:30,363 --> 01:37:33,324
Yeah. You got that killer instinct.

1217
01:37:35,409 --> 01:37:38,329
Stick around, pal.
l still got a lot to teach you.

1218
01:37:38,412 --> 01:37:40,248
Obviously.

1219
01:37:40,331 --> 01:37:43,459
Oh, Buddy, come on.
l was gonna tell you about it.

1220
01:37:43,543 --> 01:37:47,046
Calm down, all right?
We'll have dinner tonight. Bring Darien.

1221
01:37:47,129 --> 01:37:48,965
No, l can't make it tonight.

1222
01:37:49,048 --> 01:37:51,300
Hey, Buddy.

1223
01:37:51,384 --> 01:37:53,886
Are you with me?

1224
01:37:54,595 --> 01:37:57,515
l need to know if you're with me.

1225
01:37:58,850 --> 01:38:01,144
l'm with you, Gordon.

1226
01:38:05,064 --> 01:38:08,192
- Natalie, l'll be right there.
- Yes, Mr Gekko.

1227
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:18,661
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Ollie.

1228
01:38:18,744 --> 01:38:22,248
Tell them l want ziplocked mouths
on the Bluestar deal,...

1229
01:38:22,331 --> 01:38:25,918
..or l'll come down there
and rip out their fuckin' throats.

1230
01:39:08,669 --> 01:39:10,546
Bud?

1231
01:39:12,798 --> 01:39:14,884
What's going on?

1232
01:39:19,764 --> 01:39:24,560
l've been played like a grand piano
by the master, Gekko the Great.

1233
01:39:25,895 --> 01:39:28,397
Today was the big crash,...

1234
01:39:29,065 --> 01:39:31,609
..the liquidation sale.

1235
01:39:31,692 --> 01:39:36,572
He's gonna carve Bluestar
into little pieces and sell it all off.

1236
01:39:36,656 --> 01:39:38,866
Bastard!

1237
01:39:38,950 --> 01:39:41,035
l'm sorry.

1238
01:39:41,494 --> 01:39:44,497
l was afraid something
like this could happen.

1239
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:48,125
l handed it to him on a silver platter.
l told my father...

1240
01:39:48,209 --> 01:39:51,462
Bud! Bud, it's not your fault.

1241
01:39:51,546 --> 01:39:53,923
And it's not your decision.

1242
01:39:54,006 --> 01:39:56,968
l'm not gonna let it happen.

1243
01:39:57,051 --> 01:39:59,971
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you.

1244
01:40:01,305 --> 01:40:06,936
lf Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar, someone else
will. Who's to say they won't do the same?

1245
01:40:07,562 --> 01:40:10,523
At least l won't be pulling the trigger.

1246
01:40:12,066 --> 01:40:17,655
Why are you doing this?
You've worked hard to get where you are.

1247
01:40:17,738 --> 01:40:21,409
We're so close.
You don't wanna throw it all away.

1248
01:40:22,076 --> 01:40:25,413
Look, l can stay with the firm,
and you're doing fine.

1249
01:40:25,496 --> 01:40:28,416
We can survive without Gordon Gekko.

1250
01:40:36,257 --> 01:40:39,260
l'm not looking to just survive.

1251
01:40:39,343 --> 01:40:42,221
l've been doing that all my life.

1252
01:40:42,305 --> 01:40:45,266
Cut this self-pity crap, Bud!

1253
01:40:45,349 --> 01:40:48,311
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

1254
01:40:49,562 --> 01:40:55,401
lt means if you make an enemy of Gordon
Gekko, l can't be there to stand by you.

1255
01:40:56,736 --> 01:40:59,739
Oh, yeah? Do you really mean that?

1256
01:41:00,948 --> 01:41:04,160
What did he promise you?
To take you public?

1257
01:41:05,453 --> 01:41:11,167
Without his money and seal of approval
l'm not such a hot investment any more.

1258
01:41:11,250 --> 01:41:15,963
- You're just the best money can buy, Darien.
- You're not exactly pure, Bud.

1259
01:41:16,464 --> 01:41:20,510
You went after Gekko and me with
the same vengeance. Look in the mirror.

1260
01:41:20,593 --> 01:41:23,930
l'm looking, and l sure don't like what l see.

1261
01:41:25,932 --> 01:41:29,852
Fair enough. But it's not that simple, Bud.

1262
01:41:31,270 --> 01:41:34,857
When l was down and had nothing,
it was Gordon who helped me.

1263
01:41:34,941 --> 01:41:40,905
He got me all my clients - you among them -
and he can take them away from me like that.

1264
01:41:41,948 --> 01:41:45,368
You may find out that when
you've had money and lost it,...

1265
01:41:45,451 --> 01:41:48,913
- ..it's worse than never having had it at all.
- Oh, yeah?

1266
01:41:48,996 --> 01:41:51,082
That is bullshit!

1267
01:41:53,376 --> 01:41:55,461
Hey! Hey!

1268
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:59,507
You step out that door
and l am changing the locks!

1269
01:42:02,927 --> 01:42:07,723
You may not believe this, Bud,
but l really do care for you.

1270
01:42:08,808 --> 01:42:11,727
We would've made a good team.

1271
01:42:11,811 --> 01:42:14,105
l'm sorry.

1272
01:42:14,647 --> 01:42:17,024
Get the fuck outta here!

1273
01:42:31,873 --> 01:42:35,793
The market is dead right now.
Even the rich are bitching.

1274
01:42:35,877 --> 01:42:40,173
The only thing moving is the termites
and cockroaches, and my commission...

1275
01:42:40,256 --> 01:42:44,302
Look, save the rap, all right?
Just sell the fucker, fast!

1276
01:42:52,226 --> 01:42:54,729
There he is.
Where you been the last two days?

1277
01:42:54,812 --> 01:42:59,984
- Janet, get my father on the phone and...
- Your mom's been calling. Your father's...

1278
01:43:00,067 --> 01:43:03,237
- What happened?
- He had a heart attack, but he's OK.

1279
01:43:03,321 --> 01:43:06,324
- He's at St John's.
- Oh, Christ!

1280
01:43:12,747 --> 01:43:14,832
Mom? How is he?

1281
01:43:15,541 --> 01:43:18,169
He was complaining
about chest pains at work.

1282
01:43:18,252 --> 01:43:21,964
The next thing l know he's collapsed.
You gotta talk to him.

1283
01:43:22,048 --> 01:43:25,760
Don't worry, he's a tough old nut.
He's got another 20 years.

1284
01:43:25,843 --> 01:43:28,804
- He's gonna be fine, Buddy.
- ls he conscious?

1285
01:43:45,947 --> 01:43:48,032
Hiya, Dad.

1286
01:43:48,783 --> 01:43:51,994
You're looking younger every day.

1287
01:43:53,204 --> 01:43:56,541
Didn't l tell you never
to lift a 747 by yourself?

1288
01:44:00,419 --> 01:44:02,505
You even got me smoking now.

1289
01:44:06,217 --> 01:44:08,970
lt's your second heart attack, Dad.

1290
01:44:10,054 --> 01:44:12,932
You're pushing your luck.
l hope you know that.

1291
01:44:14,433 --> 01:44:16,727
l guess l never told you,...

1292
01:44:17,270 --> 01:44:19,564
..but l love you, Dad.

1293
01:44:23,151 --> 01:44:25,444
l love you so much!

1294
01:44:28,072 --> 01:44:31,200
l'm sorry... about the things l said.

1295
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:36,956
You're the only honest man l know.

1296
01:44:37,039 --> 01:44:39,125
The best.

1297
01:44:40,877 --> 01:44:43,337
l got a plan, Dad. l can save the airline.

1298
01:44:43,462 --> 01:44:48,134
l know you got no reason to believe me,
but you have to trust me, OK?

1299
01:44:48,926 --> 01:44:51,596
l need to speak to the union members.

1300
01:44:53,014 --> 01:44:54,891
Can l speak for you?

1301
01:44:56,517 --> 01:44:59,020
Your words, not mine.

1302
01:45:02,023 --> 01:45:04,108
OK.

1303
01:45:12,408 --> 01:45:14,494
l gotta go.

1304
01:45:15,244 --> 01:45:17,747
l'm proud of you.

1305
01:45:26,881 --> 01:45:29,383
The stock's at 19 1/4, and it's going up.

1306
01:45:29,467 --> 01:45:33,012
Gekko figures, by breaking up Bluestar,
it's 30 bucks a share.

1307
01:45:33,095 --> 01:45:36,557
He'll buy up to 24 and still
think he's making money.

1308
01:45:36,641 --> 01:45:38,726
How do you know it'll go up?

1309
01:45:39,393 --> 01:45:43,606
You don't wanna know, Duncan.
Let's just say l have some friends.

1310
01:45:43,689 --> 01:45:46,734
OK. What happens now?

1311
01:45:46,818 --> 01:45:49,695
When it hits 23, you go
to Gekko and lower the boom.

1312
01:45:49,779 --> 01:45:53,533
When he learns he has no union
concessions, he'll jump ship.

1313
01:45:53,616 --> 01:45:58,704
Yeah, but who'll buy then, and what's
to prevent some other shark devouring us?

1314
01:46:01,874 --> 01:46:04,377
We have an appointment to see Mr Wildman.

1315
01:46:05,044 --> 01:46:08,130
Sir Lawrence, or can l call you Larry?

1316
01:46:08,673 --> 01:46:13,261
What would you say to owning Bluestar
Airlines, with union concessions,...

1317
01:46:13,344 --> 01:46:15,179
..at $18 a share,...

1318
01:46:15,263 --> 01:46:19,851
..and, in the process, hanging
Gordon Gekko out in the wind to twist?

1319
01:46:19,934 --> 01:46:23,062
l might be very interested. Why you, mate?

1320
01:46:23,646 --> 01:46:27,733
What's a bloke like you
doing mixed up with Gekko?

1321
01:46:27,817 --> 01:46:32,989
Let's just say that me and Mr Gekko
have a serious conflict of interest.

1322
01:46:33,823 --> 01:46:36,659
But we all wanna see this airline work.

1323
01:46:36,742 --> 01:46:39,370
These figures show that it can.

1324
01:46:40,913 --> 01:46:44,417
You're prepared to take
these large salary cuts?

1325
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:48,880
We are, but we want a contract
agreement that's ironclad.

1326
01:46:48,963 --> 01:46:52,049
So if you buy it, you can't break it up.

1327
01:46:54,927 --> 01:46:57,013
l'm still listening.

1328
01:47:01,809 --> 01:47:03,060
Hi.

1329
01:47:03,144 --> 01:47:06,856
Oh, hi. Say, why don't you
get the hell out of my office?

1330
01:47:07,064 --> 01:47:10,193
l know l've been a schmuck lately.
l want to apologise.

1331
01:47:10,443 --> 01:47:14,906
You've been a real schmuck lately.
So go thou and sin no more.

1332
01:47:14,989 --> 01:47:17,074
l wanna make it up to you.

1333
01:47:18,951 --> 01:47:22,038
Bluestar. Put all your clients in it.

1334
01:47:27,668 --> 01:47:29,795
OK, Buddy-Buddy.

1335
01:47:29,879 --> 01:47:33,049
We are back in business on Bluestar.

1336
01:47:37,094 --> 01:47:41,474
Bluestar, Mr Mannheim.
Put all your clients in it. lt's gonna move.

1337
01:47:41,557 --> 01:47:45,978
l don't know where you get
your information, son, but l don't like it.

1338
01:47:46,771 --> 01:47:51,818
The main thing about money, Bud...
it makes you do things you don't wanna do.

1339
01:47:56,030 --> 01:48:02,245
Marty, a favour. 200,000 shares Bluestar at
19 1/2. Can you position it in an equity fund?

1340
01:48:02,328 --> 01:48:05,414
- The Chronicle is on seven.
- Hold, Marty.

1341
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:10,878
Listen, Blue Horseshoe
loves Bluestar Airlines. Got it?

1342
01:48:10,962 --> 01:48:13,589
- Got it.
- Right. Marty, you still there?

1343
01:48:14,173 --> 01:48:17,093
Bluestar's in play. Let's check it out.

1344
01:48:20,263 --> 01:48:22,348
(traders shouting)

1345
01:48:25,852 --> 01:48:29,522
- 19 1/4, 3 1/2. 5,000.
- 3 1/2 at 10,000.

1346
01:48:31,899 --> 01:48:34,235
l do love it so.

1347
01:48:35,736 --> 01:48:38,739
Gordon, l see it at 215 1/2.
l don't know what to make of it.

1348
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:44,078
The word is out, pal!
Your union buddies are talking.

1349
01:48:44,162 --> 01:48:47,373
You get me in at a 45-degree angle.
All the way in.

1350
01:48:47,456 --> 01:48:51,878
You slash and burn, you buy everything
in sight up to 22, then call me.

1351
01:48:53,171 --> 01:48:58,467
When l get hold of whoever leaked this, l'll
tear his eyes out and suck his fuckin' skull!

1352
01:49:07,477 --> 01:49:09,479
- Stock's going to Pluto.
- Start unloading.

1353
01:49:09,562 --> 01:49:12,398
- What? Sell?
- Dump it! Now! Dump it all!

1354
01:49:12,482 --> 01:49:15,067
- Where's Lou?
- Right over there.

1355
01:49:16,027 --> 01:49:18,571
Ken? Marvin. Jackson Steinem.

1356
01:49:18,654 --> 01:49:22,033
Dump this baby. Take the money and run.
We're getting out.

1357
01:49:22,825 --> 01:49:24,494
lt's gotta be a big hitter.

1358
01:49:24,744 --> 01:49:28,080
There's some people from Bluestar
demanding to see you.

1359
01:49:28,164 --> 01:49:31,459
- What the hell do they want?
- l'd be happy to tell you.

1360
01:49:31,542 --> 01:49:36,547
We know what you're up to, Gekko,
and you can go straight to hell!

1361
01:49:36,631 --> 01:49:38,966
No way you're gonna break up our airline.

1362
01:49:39,050 --> 01:49:43,763
- lf that's my plan, it's the first l've heard
of it. - Would you put that in writing?

1363
01:49:43,846 --> 01:49:47,642
We have an agreement,
which l expect you to honour.

1364
01:49:47,725 --> 01:49:52,855
- Then you better have a pilot's licence.
- Don't worry, the engines won't fall out.

1365
01:49:52,939 --> 01:49:56,734
But those reservations can get screwed up
if we don't pay attention.

1366
01:49:56,818 --> 01:50:00,196
Baggage for St Petersburg
could wind up in Pittsburgh.

1367
01:50:00,279 --> 01:50:03,241
Look, somebody else
wants to buy your airline.

1368
01:50:03,324 --> 01:50:07,703
You wanna be gobbled up
by Attila the Hun, you be my guest!

1369
01:50:07,787 --> 01:50:09,872
We'll take our chances.

1370
01:50:10,289 --> 01:50:12,792
Nice to see you, Gekko!

1371
01:50:16,629 --> 01:50:20,633
Fox says Bluestarjust hit 23.
What do you want him to do?

1372
01:50:22,718 --> 01:50:24,804
Sell it all.

1373
01:50:25,930 --> 01:50:30,101
- What the hell. So we only make 10 million.
- Sell it. Yes, all of it.

1374
01:50:31,853 --> 01:50:33,938
10,000 at 7 1/2!

1375
01:50:34,021 --> 01:50:35,606
At 7 1/2, sold!

1376
01:50:36,566 --> 01:50:39,235
Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, for chrissake!

1377
01:50:39,318 --> 01:50:41,028
Goddamn connection!

1378
01:50:41,112 --> 01:50:45,116
Bob, we're in big trouble on BST.
You gotta get out now.

1379
01:50:45,741 --> 01:50:46,868
Another 30,000. Out!

1380
01:50:46,951 --> 01:50:50,621
Gekko's selling. There's not many takers.
The stock is plummeting.

1381
01:50:51,038 --> 01:50:54,792
l guess l'll have to carry him
a few rounds before he drops.

1382
01:50:56,544 --> 01:51:03,217
Don't make a big deal of it. Buy it lightly
on the way down. When it hits 18, buy it all.

1383
01:51:03,467 --> 01:51:05,136
Piece of cake, Larry.

1384
01:51:05,219 --> 01:51:07,305
(traders shouting)

1385
01:51:10,057 --> 01:51:12,143
8,000 at 18.

1386
01:51:13,644 --> 01:51:15,730
What is offered at 18?

1387
01:51:16,689 --> 01:51:19,275
300,000... 300,000 at 18!

1388
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:21,068
18 for 500,000!

1389
01:51:21,152 --> 01:51:23,154
(traders) Sold!

1390
01:51:25,239 --> 01:51:27,366
- l'll sell you 50!
- l'll take it!

1391
01:51:34,540 --> 01:51:38,252
- There's gotta be a way outta this.
- Sure. Why don't you dial 911?

1392
01:51:38,336 --> 01:51:40,421
Fox is on four.

1393
01:51:40,505 --> 01:51:46,511
Where the hell are you? l am losing millions.
You sure as hell better get me out of this,...

1394
01:51:46,594 --> 01:51:50,765
..or the only job you'll have
on this street is sweeping it!

1395
01:51:51,682 --> 01:51:55,978
You once told me, don't get emotional
about stock, Gordon. Don't.

1396
01:51:56,062 --> 01:52:01,192
The bid is 16 1/2 and going down.
As your broker, l advise you to take it.

1397
01:52:01,317 --> 01:52:06,030
Yeah? Well, you take it! Right in the ass,
you fuckin' scumbag cocksucker!

1398
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:11,452
lt's two minutes to close, Gordon.
What do you wanna do? Decide.

1399
01:52:16,290 --> 01:52:18,376
Dump it.

1400
01:52:24,090 --> 01:52:28,094
The big Wall Street story today
was Bluestar Airlines.

1401
01:52:28,594 --> 01:52:33,558
Fuelled by takeover rumours, the stock
soared to an all-time high of 24 1/8.

1402
01:52:33,641 --> 01:52:37,770
When rumours later surfaced
that the takeover was unfounded,...

1403
01:52:37,854 --> 01:52:44,735
..buyers ran for cover and the stock
plummeted to 16 1/2 before closing at 17.

1404
01:52:45,153 --> 01:52:49,365
Then, amidst all the scuttlebutt,
another rumble shook the street.

1405
01:52:49,448 --> 01:52:55,079
Raider Sir Lawrence Wildman has stepped in
and bought a substantial block of Bluestar,...

1406
01:52:55,163 --> 01:52:59,500
..and will announce a deal tomorrow
that includes the support of the unions.

1407
01:52:59,584 --> 01:53:02,879
We talked with a leading
stock market analyst,...

1408
01:53:02,962 --> 01:53:06,174
..in order to understand the ramifications...

1409
01:53:06,257 --> 01:53:07,508
Son of a bitch!

1410
01:53:18,644 --> 01:53:21,689
Smile, Carolyn. There's justice in the world.

1411
01:53:36,287 --> 01:53:38,372
Good morning, folks.

1412
01:53:51,093 --> 01:53:53,179
Did somebody die?

1413
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:56,724
Yeah.

1414
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:04,357
Morning, Chuckie. Morning, Lou.

1415
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:06,108
Bud...

1416
01:54:08,194 --> 01:54:10,279
Bud, l like you.

1417
01:54:11,197 --> 01:54:13,282
Just remember something.

1418
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:21,582
Man looks in the abyss.

1419
01:54:21,666 --> 01:54:24,168
There's nothing staring back at him.

1420
01:54:24,252 --> 01:54:27,505
At that moment, man finds his character.

1421
01:54:27,588 --> 01:54:31,050
And that is what keeps him out of the abyss.

1422
01:54:33,177 --> 01:54:35,263
l think l understand.

1423
01:54:46,357 --> 01:54:48,943
Janet, get my father, will you?

1424
01:54:51,612 --> 01:54:54,323
He just came in. l'll call you back.

1425
01:54:59,162 --> 01:55:01,497
l guess you're not here to open an lRA.

1426
01:55:01,581 --> 01:55:07,461
Henry Patterson, Postal lnspection Service.
Mr Ebenhopper, US Attorney's office.

1427
01:55:07,545 --> 01:55:10,923
Evan Morrissey, Securities and
Exchange Enforcement office.

1428
01:55:11,007 --> 01:55:14,385
You're under arrest for conspiracy
to commit securities fraud,...

1429
01:55:14,469 --> 01:55:17,972
..and for violating
the lnsider Traders Sanction Act.

1430
01:55:18,055 --> 01:55:21,559
The minute l laid eyes on you,
l knew you were no good.

1431
01:55:21,642 --> 01:55:25,396
You have the right to remain silent
and refuse to answer questions.

1432
01:55:25,480 --> 01:55:28,024
Anything you do say
may be used against you.

1433
01:55:28,107 --> 01:55:30,693
You have the right to consult an attorney...

1434
01:55:30,776 --> 01:55:34,530
..and to have an attorney present
during any questioning.

1435
01:56:02,934 --> 01:56:05,019
So long, Carolyn.

1436
01:56:17,907 --> 01:56:19,450
Hiya, Buddy.

1437
01:56:19,534 --> 01:56:21,244
Gordon.

1438
01:56:21,327 --> 01:56:23,913
Sandbagged me on Bluestar, huh?

1439
01:56:24,872 --> 01:56:30,253
l guess you think you taught the teacher
a lesson, that the tail can wag the dog, huh?

1440
01:56:33,589 --> 01:56:35,633
Well, let me clue you in, pal.

1441
01:56:35,716 --> 01:56:39,345
The ice is melting right underneath your feet.

1442
01:56:42,598 --> 01:56:47,019
You think you could have gotten this far
this fast with anybody else?

1443
01:56:47,103 --> 01:56:49,105
And dickin' someone like Darien?

1444
01:56:49,188 --> 01:56:55,278
No. You'd be cold-calling widows and
dentists to buy fuckin' dogshit stock!

1445
01:56:55,361 --> 01:56:57,155
l took you in!

1446
01:56:57,446 --> 01:56:59,323
A nobody!

1447
01:56:59,949 --> 01:57:01,909
l opened doors for you.

1448
01:57:01,993 --> 01:57:06,747
l showed you how the system works,
the value of information, how to get it!

1449
01:57:06,831 --> 01:57:09,917
Fulham Oil, Brant Resources, Geodynamics!

1450
01:57:10,001 --> 01:57:12,712
And this is how you fuckin'
pay me back, you cockroach!

1451
01:57:15,256 --> 01:57:17,341
l gave you Darien!

1452
01:57:17,675 --> 01:57:21,345
l gave you your manhood!
l gave you everything!

1453
01:57:33,524 --> 01:57:36,360
You coulda been one of
the great ones, Buddy.

1454
01:57:37,945 --> 01:57:41,199
l look at you... and l see myself.

1455
01:57:43,117 --> 01:57:45,203
Why?

1456
01:57:46,579 --> 01:57:48,664
l don't know.

1457
01:57:50,333 --> 01:57:52,585
l guess l realised that...

1458
01:57:52,877 --> 01:57:55,171
..l'm just Bud Fox.

1459
01:57:57,089 --> 01:58:00,009
As much as l wanted to be Gordon Gekko...

1460
01:58:00,635 --> 01:58:03,054
..l'll always be Bud Fox.

1461
01:58:49,350 --> 01:58:53,437
(tape) l showed you how the system works,
the value of information, how to get it!

1462
01:58:53,521 --> 01:58:55,606
Fulham Oil, Brant Resources...

1463
01:58:59,026 --> 01:59:01,529
You did the right thing, Bud.

1464
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:11,330
(Carl) You told the truth
and gave the money back.

1465
01:59:11,497 --> 01:59:15,418
All things considered in this
cockamamie world, you're shooting par.

1466
01:59:15,501 --> 01:59:19,046
You helped save the airline,
and they'll remember you for it.

1467
01:59:19,130 --> 01:59:23,468
That's right. Think about the job
at Bluestar that Wildman offered you.

1468
01:59:23,551 --> 01:59:26,012
Dad, l'm going to jail and you know it.

1469
01:59:26,262 --> 01:59:29,807
Yeah, well... maybe that's the price, son.

1470
01:59:29,932 --> 01:59:32,018
lt's gonna be hard on you,...

1471
01:59:32,101 --> 01:59:37,148
..but maybe in a kind of screwed-up way it's
the best thing that coulda happened to you.

1472
01:59:37,231 --> 01:59:40,985
Stop going for the easy buck
and produce something with your life.

1473
01:59:41,068 --> 01:59:45,198
Create, instead of living off
the buying and selling of others.

1474
01:59:50,661 --> 01:59:53,122
We'll park the car and catch up with you.

1475
01:59:53,206 --> 01:59:54,874
All right.

1476
02:00:52,276 --> 02:00:57,467
Sync for
"Wall.Street.1987.BluRay.720P.DTS.x264-CHD"
