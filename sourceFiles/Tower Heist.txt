00:00:50,416 --> 00:01:00,416
Tower Heist

1
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,460
Good morning, New York.

2
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:29,088
Today we are talking about cheese
until the sun comes up.

3
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,466
Specifically, bouchon cheese.

4
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,261
I like to pair this with a nice '77 sauvignon blanc.

5
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,806
It's perfect for an intimate meal
or for a large gathering.

6
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,322
You will never go wrong with semi-soft cheeses.

7
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,948
Let us go to Scott in Crown Heights.

8
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,533
He has been wondering about Brie.

9
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,660
NASDAQ dropped its noisy effort

10
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,871
to take over the New York Stock Exchange.

11
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,706
It slunk away saying it became clear

12
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,792
regulators wouldn't approve a merger

13
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,628
of the US's two dominant stock exchanges.

14
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,756
I think we have Barbara in the Bronx.

15
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,133
She's got a question about cheddar.

16
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:15,885
Go ahead, Barbara.

17
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,889
You can have my rook, but I will take

18
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:21,891
that.

19
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,851
Boom.

20
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,729
It seems investors may be in for an equally wild ride.

21
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,820
Get that bike around back. Come on, empty the truck.

22
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,367
Hey, it's the man in the suit. Hey.

23
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,910
What are you doing walking on my side of the street?

24
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:41,994
Very funny.

25
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,746
Punk-ass bitches walk on the other side of the street.

26
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:44,914
Same jokes as yesterday.

27
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,916
Walk by me again and I'm going to whoop your ass.

28
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:28,291
Good morning, Mr. Shaw. You are
looking lean and mean today.

29
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,042
This is why I love you, Lester.

30
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,711
You're the best liar in New York.

31
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,212
Morning, Mr. Shaw. Hiya.

32
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,630
Everything is set for your dinner party.

33
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,592
I'm sending up some bouchon paired
with a '77 sauvignon blanc.

34
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,801
Very nice.

35
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,469
If you don't mind my saying, are you sure you want

36
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,889
Secretary Lowe and Janet Ramsey
at the party together?

37
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,348
They were mentioned again on Page Six.

38
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,184
Jesus! I totally forgot they were screwing.

39
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,936
Yeah. Nice save, Josh.

40
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,229
What the hell would I do without you?

41
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,939
You would have to read the Post yourself.

42
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,649
No, I'm serious.

43
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,735
I am kicking the tires on a couple deals.

44
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,320
I might buy a hotel in Saint Bart's.

45
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,738
I'm looking for a GM.

46
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,323
I'm going to try and steal you away.

47
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,158
If I could bring Lester, we might have a deal.

48
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,160
Okay, deal.

49
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,621
All right. Have a good one.

50
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,164
Josh, one more thing.

51
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,290
What is that, sir?

52
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,875
Checkmate.

53
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,215
You got a security report for me?

54
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,761
Not much, Mr. K. A car alarm, two
homeless and a really loud dog.

55
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,387
Good morning, Josh. Hey, Rose.

56
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:24,639
How was your weekend?

57
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,891
Good. I was here. We steam-cleaned the garage,

58
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,643
had some killer take-out from Punjab Palace.

59
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,394
You are a wild man. That's me.

60
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,771
Mr. K.

61
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,105
Hey, Odessa.

62
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,608
My work visa's about to expire.
You must find me a husband.

63
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,361
Okay. Can I have my bagel first?

64
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,447
I need a man before these pricks
throw me out of the country.

65
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,200
All right, and what about Manuel? He's a catch.

66
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,203
I tried. He couldn't handle me.

67
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,582
Okay. Rose, don't write that down.

68
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:52,917
Morning. Morning, Kwan.

69
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:56,045
We have birthdays in 3714 and 4399.

70
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,965
The Jameson twins like the cupcakes from Magnolia,

71
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,468
Mr. Causwell likes the hot fudge sundae at Sardi's.

72
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,637
And Mrs. Hightower landed three days early

73
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,138
from Cairo, be here in an hour.

74
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,264
Does Mr. Hightower know?

75
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,225
Josh, a word, right now.

76
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,060
Yes, sir, Mr. Simon.

77
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,356
Where's Charlie? I got an empty concierge desk.

78
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,066
I think he's checking on Mrs. Cronan.

79
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,902
Now that's bullshit! Mrs. Cronan is at physical therapy.

80
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,779
He has got three minutes.

81
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,366
...can only be convicted if the
prosecution proves all the...

82
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,534
Miss lovenko.

83
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,703
Holy shit! What?

84
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,079
We do this thing, you and I,

85
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,622
where you pretend not to study for the bar exam

86
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:32,790
and I pretend not to notice.

87
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,167
I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about, sir.

88
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,711
See, we're doing it. Doing what?

89
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,421
Right now, we're doing the thing,
where you pretend not...

90
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,505
No.

91
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,632
I know the exam is coming up this
week, so study in my office

92
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:43,342
during your lunch break, okay? Because I never use it.

93
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,803
Okay, but I'm not studying, so
it would not make much sense.

94
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,139
Wait. Shh! Hear that?

95
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,391
Someone is buzzing.

96
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,977
Hey, shush!

97
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,103
Everybody, shush!

98
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,397
Who's buzzing?

99
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,649
I hear it. It's faint,

100
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,985
it's muffled, but I hear it. Fess up!

101
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,194
Who's buzzing? Come on!

102
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,446
Who the hell is buzzing?

103
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,032
It's me, my bad. I had it on vibrate.

104
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,367
Josh, this is Enrique Dev'Reaux.

105
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:09,785
He's our new elevator operator.

106
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,870
I didn't hire you.

107
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,039
He's a quarter Cherokee, you know we need an Indian.

108
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,540
So give him a shot.

109
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,293
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Kovaks.

110
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,503
I've spent the last three years working at the BK,

111
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,005
and I'm ready for the big leagues.

112
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,090
BK? What is that? A building downtown?

113
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,217
No, it's a Burger King in Times Square.

114
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,095
All right. Walk with me, Mr. Dev'Reaux.

115
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,182
The average apartment at The
Tower costs $5.6 million.

116
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,601
It's the most expensive real estate in North America.

117
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,103
We have the best views, the most
advanced security system,

118
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:39,857
keyless entry, 24-hour video vibration detection.

119
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,442
But you know what these people are really buying?

120
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:43,819
White neighbors?

121
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,321
Us. The staff.

122
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,199
They pay for our full and undivided
attention seven days a week.

123
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,201
So there's no cell phones, iPhones,

124
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,911
BlackBerries, texting, tweeting...

125
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,121
They had a rule at the BK, no sex in the storage room.

126
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,539
Same as your phone rule, right?

127
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,126
No, not the same, because your dick

128
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,669
has to come with you to work, Mr. Dev'Reaux,

129
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,713
but your phone can stay at home.

130
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:05,091
So don't hide it in your pocket or tuck it into your sock,

131
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,926
don't tape it under your balls or stick it up your ass,

132
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,928
because, eventually, I will find it.

133
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,014
They never checked my balls at the BK.

134
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:16,685
Sir, you can call me "Enrique" or "Lil' Disco"
or "The Puerto Rican Mohican,"

135
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,895
that's my hip-hop name.

136
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,109
Morning, Judge Ramos. How did you do?

137
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,069
I ran the Reservoir, 15 flat.

138
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,153
Nice.

139
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,571
Where's Charlie? I need my cigars.

140
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,532
I think he took Mrs. Cronan to physical therapy.

141
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,741
I'll bring them up the second he gets here.

142
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:31,867
Thank you.

143
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:32,993
- Hey, Lester. - Good morning, Lester.

144
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,078
Hi, Lester.

145
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,872
What's invisible and smells like worms?

146
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,457
Bird farts.

147
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,084
We've heard that one before.

148
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,460
Have a great day at school.

149
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,087
Morning, Mr. Hightower.

150
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,296
Ma'am.

151
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,259
Sir, that package you ordered from
Cairo arrived three days early.

152
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,593
Hmm. Yeah.

153
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,428
It's on its way from the airport right now.

154
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:52,596
Josh, can you have the chauffeur

155
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:53,848
pick us up at the back, please?

156
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,516
Already done. Thank you.

157
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,268
Darling, let's go.

158
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,982
That guy's daughter looks like a prostitute.

159
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,692
We're all about discretion here, Mr. Dev'Reaux.

160
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,361
Right, right. How do you guys split up the tips?

161
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,238
We don't. We never take tips at The Tower.

162
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,573
No, I don't really want to talk about it right now.

163
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,241
Charlie. - Sasha!

164
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,702
Your brother's coming, I'm at work
and I can't talk right now.

165
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,663
You're 20 minutes late! Where
are Judge Ramos' cigars?

166
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,789
Right here.

167
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,000
Josh, I'm freaking out.

168
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,626
Can I help you?

169
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:23,752
Go.

170
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:24,837
What?

171
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,173
We just went to the OB/GYN, the
baby is in the third trimester,

172
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,675
its head is six inches wide, your
sister has a tiny vagina.

173
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,386
Everyone tells me to stop worrying.
I said, "Stop worrying?"

174
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,013
In labor its head is going to get crushed

175
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,806
or it's going to blow out your sister's vagina.

176
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,099
Don't say the "V" word in the lobby.

177
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,184
I called your Uncle Marty.

178
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,312
He said all the women in your family
have teeny tiny vaginas.

179
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,606
I've been covering your ass all week.

180
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,857
Simon is breathing down my neck.

181
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,901
What are you doing? I'm worried.

182
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,320
Did you hear what I was saying?
Simon is going to fire you.

183
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,448
Simon is not going to fire me
today. I got the red flowers.

184
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,532
Red flowers?

185
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:54,658
Yeah, it's Chinese New Year.

186
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,076
Mrs. Jin will be down here any second.

187
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,996
It's crucial the first thing she
hears be something positive.

188
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,206
Her entire year depends on it.

189
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,249
Mrs. Jin.

190
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,636
Happy New Year.

191
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,809
Did you see that smile?

192
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,396
Wanted to see me?

193
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,606
Yeah.

194
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,401
Fitzhugh is refusing to leave.

195
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,237
We've never had a forced eviction at The Tower.

196
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,572
If they drag Mr. Fitzhugh and his family into the street,

197
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:34,740
it's bad for all of us.

198
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,158
Why don't you talk to him?

199
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,451
This is your responsibility, Josh.

200
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,286
The bank comes in the morning. Get him out.

201
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,714
Mr. Fitzhugh, it's Josh Kovaks, sir.

202
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,182
Good morning, Josh. Are you alone?

203
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,267
Yeah.

204
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,486
Hey, did you see what the market did today?

205
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,282
Went up 106 points. Ask me why it did that?

206
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,366
Why?

207
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,660
I don't know, but I used to know.

208
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,412
That's why they hired me at Merrill Lynch.

209
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,624
Mr. Fitzhugh, you know this apartment
is now owned by the bank.

210
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,251
They'd like you to vacate immediately.

211
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,128
We told the kids that we were turning the apartment

212
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,879
into a park. Going green.

213
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,798
That's how we explained all the furniture

214
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,259
being sold and the tents in the living room.

215
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,846
Luckily, my children aren't very
bright, so they bought it.

216
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,890
But they have smart friends and
those friends are catching on.

217
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,310
Sir, the bank will be here tomorrow morning.

218
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,688
I went to Yale 20 years ago, and now I'm a squatter.

219
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,401
Can't wait for their reunion. "Hello,
nice to see you. I squat."

220
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,486
What about family?

221
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:58,324
No, I invested all their money.
They won't return my calls.

222
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,618
I'd sleep in my car, but they repossessed
it three months ago.

223
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,245
So, you see, I have to stay here,

224
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,789
because we have nowhere else to go.

225
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,542
It's illegal for you to be here.
You're committing a crime.

226
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,002
I understand that.

227
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,426
But we might be doing some elevator
maintenance tomorrow.

228
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,306
I'm thinking that the elevators will be shut down

229
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:27,478
and those people from the bank will just
have to come back another time.

230
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,942
Because, it's like you go down one.

231
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,448
Hey, Mr. Kovaks.

232
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,201
Mr. Shaw, I see you met Mr. Dev'Reaux.

233
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:45,245
This guy owns his own island with
jet skis. How cool is that?

234
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,914
He's our probationary elevator operator.

235
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,832
He's still very early in the interview process.

236
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,335
Why don't we finish the job interview right now, Josh?

237
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,129
Suppose I ask you to pick me up a cheeseburger,

238
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,506
Enrique, what would you say?

239
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,007
How do you like it cooked?

240
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,593
The thing is, I like a certain kind of Brie on my burger,

241
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,221
and they only sell it at Danny's
Cheese Shop downtown.

242
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,847
I'm on my way.

243
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,475
And the beef has to be grass-fed.

244
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,602
The best butcher shop in New York
is on Bleecker Street, sir.

245
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,230
Josh, hire him.

246
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,025
Yes, that was my gut, sir.

247
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,151
And, Enrique, one other thing.

248
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,404
I like to get my own burgers whenever possible.

249
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,697
I may have my own private island in Belize,

250
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,700
but deep down I'm just an Astoria boy like Josh here.

251
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,035
We come from the same neighborhood.

252
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,287
That's right, PS 104. Go Lions!

253
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,750
My first real job was shoveling horseshit
at Aqueduct Racetrack.

254
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,544
Don't you ever let me forget it.

255
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:34,878
I won't, sir.

256
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,342
All right, go downstairs and get a nametag from Rose.

257
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,344
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

258
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,810
Why don't we hit it tonight, Josh? Raise some hell.

259
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,979
We have to be back here in nine hours.

260
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:55,065
Remember that time you danced
on that bar in Times Square?

261
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,442
I almost fainted.

262
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,902
That's a drunken dream you had six years ago.

263
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,156
You were shaking your ass up there like Tina Turner.

264
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,450
Running half naked on Broadway

265
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,661
telling tourists you were Mustafa from The Lion King.

266
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,163
That's ridiculous. It never happened.

267
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,584
I was waiting to tell you. This is going
to be my last year at The Tower.

268
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:14,668
What?

269
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,920
In a few months, I'm headed to San Diego

270
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,672
to spend a little time with Lorraine.

271
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,884
I might even cruise around the world
with all the other old farts.

272
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,802
Wow.

273
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,556
That's great. That's really great. I'm going to miss you.

274
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,558
I'll be thinking about you, Josh.

275
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,976
Here's your bus.

276
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,312
Be thinking about how you danced on that bar.

277
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,314
Yeah! I got it all up here.

278
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,982
I don't know where you got that.

279
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,151
Circle of life, Josh. Circle of life!

280
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,619
Not many of you kill your own Thanksgiving turkey,

281
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,287
but you might want to consider it.

282
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,831
Shit, Rita, get your ass back in here!

283
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:53,999
I ain't going to be chasing you all around.

284
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,167
Goodbye, Slide!

285
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,919
Hey, hey, Rita, come on now, it's 5:30 in the morning.

286
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,504
Not little shit like this. Come on now.

287
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,130
I told you, I don't even know nobody named Maria.

288
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,882
Yeah, well, she sure as shit knows you, Slide!

289
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:02,966
It was a wrong number.

290
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,135
Then why did she ask for you, stupid? Why?

291
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,929
It was a wrong number! I just...

292
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,515
I don't know what you are saying, bitch!

293
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,775
Lester, it's 9: 15. Why is Mr. Shaw's car still here?

294
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,859
Maybe he's sick.

295
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,198
That black sedan has been parked there for two days.

296
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,866
Why no boot or ticket?

297
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,243
I called the cops twice.

298
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,544
Do you remember that morning robbery

299
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,963
at the International last year?

300
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,591
I want you to slowly lock the door and clear the lobby.

301
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,760
Stay calm.

302
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,433
Lock it down. Code Black on all doors and elevators.

303
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,269
Repeat, Code Black.

304
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:56,812
What's Code Black?

305
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,398
Are you serious? We talked about
it at the meeting last month.

306
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,941
Let me see the outside of the building.

307
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,067
I think we're about to be robbed.

308
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,152
There were four guys out there with guns.

309
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,487
Where did they go?

310
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,155
Let me see the garage.

311
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,325
Why is Stillman here? Laundry pick-up was yesterday.

312
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,244
Mr. Shaw asked us to call him.

313
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,162
Someone spilled wine on his tablecloth.

314
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,206
He's bringing it down right now.

315
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,667
Wait a second. Those are not the Stillman brothers.

316
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,338
Oh, my God, they're taking Shaw.

317
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,923
This isn't a robbery, it's a kidnapping.

318
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,633
It's a kidnapping! Call 911!

319
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:27,718
Yes, sir.

320
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:28,844
Code Black, Manuel! Code Black!

321
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,928
What's Code Black?

322
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,307
Hey! Whoa! Whoa!

323
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,892
Hey! Stop!

324
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,148
Shoot at the tires!

325
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,608
I only have my Taser!

326
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
Hey, stop!

327
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,967
Watch out!

328
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:14,473
Move in! Move in! Move in!

329
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,308
Don't move.

330
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,894
Get your hands in the air!

331
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,523
FBI, show me your hands.

332
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,651
- Let's go. - Okay, all right.

333
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,069
Put them behind your back!

334
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,153
Take it easy.

335
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,739
No, get off him! He's the victim!

336
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,783
That's Arthur Shaw! He lives in The Tower.

337
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,243
He was bringing his laundry
down. They kidnapped him.

338
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,455
This was not a kidnapping, it was an attempt to flee.

339
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:39,748
What?

340
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,085
Arrest him and get him out of here.

341
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,463
Josh, do me a favor, turn off the
heater and cover the pool.

342
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,048
I hate to waste money.

343
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,014
Wall Street kingpin Arthur Shaw,

344
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,725
number 138 on the Forbes 400 last year,

345
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,145
was arrested today in Manhattan
while trying to flee the city.

346
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,314
Sources have confirmed that he'll be charged

347
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,358
with several counts of securities fraud

348
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,820
and an immediate asset freeze of Mr.
Shaw's holdings has been ordered.

349
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,155
Shaw's lawyers have called the arrest

350
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,324
"another example of the Wall Street witch-hunt,"

351
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:16,618
but sources at the SEC believe the fraud

352
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,413
in this case could be of epic proportions.

353
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,127
In this country you're innocent until proven guilty,

354
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,505
so no matter what you hear about
Mr. Shaw being a liar and a cheat,

355
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,258
or his entire business being some
sort of elaborate scam,

356
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:32,843
we simply don't know the truth yet.

357
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,761
I've got shoes to polish, Mr. K.

358
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,388
What does this got to do with us?

359
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,225
For the last six years, Mr. Shaw
was on the board of The Tower.

360
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,644
So we have to find a new board member?

361
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,104
No.

362
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,315
Several years ago at one of the meetings,

363
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,151
he was asked to do a favor for us.

364
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,111
He was asked to manage all of your pensions.

365
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,195
Pensions?

366
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,488
And he did.

367
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,532
He took us on even though it was a small account.

368
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,992
He agreed to handle it.

369
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:58,994
Who asked him to do that?

370
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,331
I did, Rose. I asked him.

371
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,211
Mr. K, what's left in the pension?

372
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,173
Kwan, all this just happened, so
there's no way of knowing,

373
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,758
and by the way, this could be a mistake.

374
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,177
How much, Josh? Tell us.

375
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,514
Right now, they're saying that anyone who

376
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,516
invested with Mr. Shaw has been defrauded,

377
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,519
and that more than likely, it's all gone.

378
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,271
There is no pension.

379
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,898
Wait, wait. Wait a minute. I'm sorry.

380
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,399
How did this happen?

381
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,984
The guy is the best in New York

382
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,903
and he promised he could triple our portfolio.

383
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,029
So they're going to get our money?

384
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,739
The guy had billions of dollars, right?

385
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:36,907
Of course, it's just a matter of time.

386
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:41,620
So we have to stay patient and be positive,
because it has to be there.

387
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,663
I heard on the news when they arrested Shaw

388
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,707
that he only had $600 in his checking account.

389
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,003
Look, some of you may need
some time to process this.

390
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,129
If anyone wants to go home,

391
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,757
I will call in a temp crew for the rest of the day.

392
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,051
I'm sure that this will all be cleared up tomorrow.

393
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,761
Can I ask you something, Mr. K?

394
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,845
Yeah.

395
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,597
Did he get your money, too?

396
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,058
Yeah, Odessa.

397
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,560
For the record,

398
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,563
I never asked anyone to triple my portfolio.

399
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,403
Just an hour ago,

400
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:19,491
a federal judge released Arthur
Shaw on $10 million bail,

401
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:23,537
on condition he remain under house
arrest at his penthouse apartment

402
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,705
on Central Park West.

403
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,998
Mr. Shaw, I need a statement from you.

404
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,041
You need to back off.

405
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,377
Can I get a comment please, Mr. Shaw?

406
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,712
You need to back off. Excuse me.

407
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:36,216
Here! Over here! Come on, Shaw! Right here! Shaw!

408
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,426
Shaw, can we get a picture?

409
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,137
Over here, Mr. Shaw!

410
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,061
We're taking Shaw and his attorney
up to the penthouse.

411
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,021
I need Mr. Shaw's personal security code.

412
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,898
24719.

413
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:56,486
That was my street address on Steinway
Boulevard in Astoria when I was a kid.

414
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,993
My client would like access to the gym on 43.

415
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,246
Even serial killers get 15 minutes of exercise a day.

416
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,290
He has my permission to jump out the window.

417
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,668
The rules of Mr. Shaw's house arrest are simple.

418
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,921
Kovaks, no visitors without prior
permission from the FBI.

419
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,716
All incoming and outgoing mail
gets vetted by my office.

420
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,509
All food deliveries, packages,

421
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:22,387
cleaning, repairs, all that has to be
cleared by the agent on duty.

422
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,598
You tell your staff that this penthouse is now

423
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:27,100
a maximum security prison and
it will be guarded as such.

424
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,644
The FBI is in control of the elevator and this floor.

425
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,981
What the hell is this?

426
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,778
Agent Denham, that is a 1963 Ferrari 250 GT Lusso,

427
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:42,282
owned and raced by the coolest cat
who ever lived, Steve McQueen.

428
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,284
This was his baby,

429
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,744
and now it's my baby.

430
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,956
You got Steve McQueen's car
parked in your living room?

431
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,250
And here I thought you were an asshole.

432
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,127
I paid a million for it 10 years ago.

433
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,129
I wouldn't sell it for 10 times that.

434
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,590
We're 65 stories up. How do we get it out of here?

435
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,133
You don't.

436
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,344
This car was taken apart piece by piece

437
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,887
and reassembled inside this room.

438
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:06,097
This car will eventually be sold at auction

439
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,724
with the rest of your belongings.

440
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:11,061
Only if I'm guilty, Agent Denham, which I'm not.

441
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:17,025
If you leave this apartment for
any reason without my say so,

442
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,902
and you'll be remanded into federal custody

443
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,196
and forfeit $10 million bail.

444
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,698
You have yourself a nice day, Mr. Shaw.

445
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,326
Kovaks, will you come with me?

446
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,827
Josh, do me a favor, will you?

447
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,746
Yes, sir, Mr. Shaw.

448
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,290
Make sure you handle all my food deliveries.

449
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,959
You're smart enough to know I'm innocent.

450
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,753
I don't want the help to spit in my coffee.

451
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,005
They wouldn't do that, sir.

452
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,924
Yeah, but you get it, right?

453
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,051
Do it as a favor to me.

454
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,305
Sorry, we don't accept tips at The Tower.

455
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,809
Right, I'm sorry. Sometimes I forget the rules.

456
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,567
Why did you let him get away with that?

457
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,154
When he made that crack about
the help spitting in his coffee.

458
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,824
You wanted to hurt him. Hell, I wanted to hurt him.

459
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,994
Sometimes residents say things they
don't mean. It doesn't faze me.

460
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,745
Either that or you got no balls.

461
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,871
What?

462
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,790
I'm out of line. I'm sorry.

463
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,333
I have balls, all right.

464
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,043
I'm sure you got big balls. Whatever.

465
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,462
I don't have to defend my balls to you.

466
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,340
I'm just saying the guy stole from everyone
who works in your building

467
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:23,842
and it looked like you gave him a free pass.

468
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,802
Maybe next time I'll rip out his larynx,

469
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,805
but today I chose to do my job
as manager of this building.

470
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,182
Okay, my mistake, Kovaks.

471
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,727
Just that most guys from your block in Astoria

472
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:34,894
can't control themselves.

473
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,313
And most girls from Forest Hills
don't end up in the FBI.

474
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,690
That's where you're from, right?

475
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,033
Here.

476
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:51,619
This is where most white-collar
crimes are solved, the garbage.

477
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,872
When do you think you will be getting the money back?

478
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,124
I'm not really allowed to discuss the case with you.

479
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,126
But you're allowed to clothesline me?

480
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,878
I was apprehending a fugitive.

481
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,172
He's only a fugitive if he's guilty, right?

482
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:03,339
Oh!

483
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,716
Aren't you the loyal friend?

484
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,509
I never said we were friends.

485
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,137
You play chess together,

486
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,139
you're the one who asked him to invest the pension.

487
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,517
I get his mail, I open his car door,

488
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,644
I buy his cheese. We're not friends.

489
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,354
Let me ask you something, Kovaks.

490
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,607
If he's innocent, where's the money?

491
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:21,775
How should I know?

492
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,695
The same way you knew I was from Forest Hills.

493
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,030
You pay attention.

494
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,036
I just want to know what I'm supposed to tell my staff.

495
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,289
Is that too much to ask?

496
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,209
Tell them he's guilty.

497
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:42,545
Get on the car!

498
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,963
Hey! Hey, hey!

499
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:45,965
Come on, put your hands behind your back!

500
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,425
Come on, man, what's this about?

501
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,469
This is bullshit! Shit! That's police brutality, yo!

502
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,054
Come on now.

503
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,555
Man in the suit, you seeing this shit?

504
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,099
You're my witness. Take a cell phone picture.

505
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,642
Take a picture, man.

506
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,393
No, my cell phone doesn't have a camera.

507
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,896
If you see Rita, tell her I said to call her brother.

508
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,648
Rita? Yeah, her brother's a bail bondsman.

509
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:02,816
Tell her I said to use that money

510
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,526
I gave her to get her teeth fixed.

511
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,486
Come on now, what you got
to be pushing me like that?

512
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:17,205
Ladies and gentlemen, the next Brooklyn bound

513
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,125
local train is now arriving.

514
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,919
Please step away from the platform edge,

515
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:27,382
especially when trains are entering
and leaving the station.

516
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,486
Hello.

517
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,823
Dr. Carr, dial 118, please.

518
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,536
Hey, what happened?

519
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,788
Lester tried to step in front of a subway train tonight.

520
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,666
An off-duty traffic cop was there

521
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,334
and pulled him back at the last second.

522
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,211
They have him on a 48-hour hold.

523
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:06,337
Where is he?

524
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,979
If you wanted a sick day, all you had to do was ask.

525
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,149
Seriously, I need you back at work.

526
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,776
I'm going to tell the doctor somebody pushed you.

527
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,528
It was a misunderstanding, okay?

528
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,616
I gave it to him, Josh. All my money.

529
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,743
I asked him to invest it for me.

530
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:38,995
Shaw? Yeah.

531
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:43,249
A couple of months ago, I gave him
everything I had, my life savings.

532
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:44,834
Six years working the back door

533
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:46,961
at the Waldorf, nine at the Carlyle,

534
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,631
three at the Pierre, 11 with you at The Tower.

535
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,884
That's 29 years of opening doors.

536
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:56,387
$73,000 and change, and I gave him every penny.

537
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,099
In a few months I won't have money for rent.

538
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,602
I can't retire now.

539
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:07,357
All those years of opening doors, year after year.

540
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,987
Truth is, people can open their own doors.

541
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,950
Not the way you do it.

542
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,205
Lester, he's going to pay you back every penny.

543
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,374
I promise.

544
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,628
Josh, please calm down.

545
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:29,712
Hold the elevator.

546
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,339
You can't go up there.

547
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,091
You're acting like a vigilante. Move your hand.

548
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,425
I won't move my hand. Move your hand!

549
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,885
Relax. You're not using your head.

550
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,303
Hey, Charlie. Hey, Josh.

551
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:38,429
Hey.

552
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,640
So, they're evicting me this morning.

553
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,725
My wife already took the kids, wants a divorce.

554
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,477
So, if you need me, I'll be living in this box.

555
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,938
Can I ask you a question? You're a Wall Street guy.

556
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,773
When did Shaw realize that it was over for him?

557
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,651
Ten months, maybe a year.

558
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,987
I heard he was interviewing lawyers over the summer.

559
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,364
So if he took someone's money a few months ago?

560
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,033
Probably needed the cash to keep up appearances.

561
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:02,620
Throw his famous Labor Day party at the beach.

562
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:05,123
At a certain point, it isn't about securities fraud,

563
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,207
it's about catering.

564
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,922
Drop Mr. Fitzhugh on 59.

565
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,215
I'm going to the penthouse.

566
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:16,384
Wow! This is going to be good.

567
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:21,264
Don't get up. Whoa! Where do you think you're going?

568
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,974
We're just going to get the trash.

569
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,934
And the breakfast order.

570
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,269
Go ahead.

571
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,189
Takes a village.

572
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,489
Good morning, Josh, Charlie,
Enrique. How are you doing?

573
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,742
How was your Labor Day party this year, Mr. Shaw?

574
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,369
Must have been something, huh?
What did you serve? Crab legs?

575
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:44,912
Surf and turf?

576
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:48,207
I've always tried to extend you a certain courtesy,

577
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,792
but this tone you're using...

578
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,919
What tone? Who gives a shit about my tone?

579
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,255
What are you, some kind of tone master?

580
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,883
Josh, come on. I'm going to ask you one time, okay?

581
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,760
So you better think really hard.

582
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,428
Why did you take Lester's money?

583
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:09,437
He came to me, he asked me to
invest and I did. It was a favor.

584
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:13,107
Mm-hmm. $73,000? A favor? Everything he had.

585
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,901
Did Lester ask you to come up here?

586
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:16,235
Mr. Shaw,

587
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,946
a few hours ago, Lester stepped
in front of a subway train.

588
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,115
Oh, Jesus.

589
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,953
Here we go. What are you doing?

590
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,540
Josh, you need to listen to me. The FBI is lying to you.

591
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,666
Josh, put down the club.

592
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,461
Christ's sake, don't do anything you can't undo.

593
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:38,091
Investing money is a gamble. It doesn't always pay off.

594
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,051
Mr. Shaw, do you care?

595
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,469
Josh, come on. No, really.

596
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,930
Do you feel any responsibility
for what happened to Lester?

597
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,223
Of course I feel badly.

598
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,850
I had no idea he was going to lose everything.

599
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:50,311
Lester has been a part of my life for over a decade.

600
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:55,233
Then why haven't you asked me
whether he's alive or dead?

601
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,071
Josh, this car is irreplaceable!

602
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,823
Not like doormen!

603
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,325
They make new ones of those all the time.

604
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,829
Must be 50 new doormen coming
off the line in Michigan right now!

605
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:09,705
God damn it! Stop it!

606
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,582
Want some Brie with your burger? Here you go.

607
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,126
Josh, don't! Shh!

608
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,961
Want me to come work for you, huh?

609
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,462
Want to steal me away to Saint Bart's?

610
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,048
Come on, let's go! I'm ready to rock!

611
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,384
Mr. Kovaks, let me have a swing at that shit!

612
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,011
No! Nobody touches this car but me.

613
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:27,348
You think Steve McQueen is the
coolest cat that ever lived?

614
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:30,518
Guess what? Today, Steve McQueen is my little bitch.

615
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:35,565
Ooh!

616
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,358
Ah!

617
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,026
Oh!

618
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,446
Whoops.

619
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,202
Don't worry, I'll have the help come clean that up.

620
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,371
Let's go.

621
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,541
Josh, aren't you forgetting something?

622
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,210
My breakfast order.

623
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,925
Do you understand the shit-storm

624
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,260
that can be brought down on this building?

625
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:07,180
Shaw's lawyer will shove harassment,
destruction of property

626
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,640
and civil rights charges right down our throats!

627
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,184
Now, I don't care what Shaw did

628
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,977
or how much money he's accused of stealing.

629
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,396
And you know damn well I got murdered
by that son of a bitch!

630
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,815
But a line has been crossed, and a gang of vigilantes

631
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,525
will not be tolerated at The Tower.

632
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,735
You're all fired.

633
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,362
Hey, wait, hold on. Mr. Simon, they
had nothing to do with this.

634
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:24,572
They just followed me up there.

635
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,656
I don't give a shit!

636
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,575
Mr. Simon, wait a minute, my wife
is eight months pregnant.

637
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,827
You should have thought of that before
you walked in that apartment.

638
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:31,037
We went up there for Lester!

639
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,872
Lester's job is waiting for him when he gets out.

640
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:36,042
Meanwhile, the rest of you, I want
you out of the building right now.

641
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:59,899
Um, the carpet cleaners are coming
tomorrow, they start on 44. Okay?

642
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,442
Bye, Joshie.

643
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,028
Good luck with the bar.

644
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,781
I don't know what you're talking about.

645
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:15,581
All right. Let's go, everyone. Back to work, okay?

646
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,631
Hey, Charlie, wait!

647
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,383
Wait. I'll call Sasha, all right.

648
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,467
I'll tell her you tried to stop me.

649
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,719
Please, don't do me any favors.

650
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,221
And, Josh, don't pretend to care now,

651
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,931
I know you always wanted to fire me.

652
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,392
That's because you stink at this job.

653
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:37,019
So I stink? I stink? Yeah.

654
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:39,522
The guy who made Mrs. Jin smile
on Chinese New Year?

655
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:41,482
Mrs. Jin is Korean.

656
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:42,900
She's what?

657
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:44,068
That's why she was smiling.

658
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,653
She's not Chinese, she's Korean.

659
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:47,446
And you believed her?

660
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,282
Yeah, she's Korean.

661
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,493
All right, Josh, maybe she's Korean.

662
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,328
Why are you whispering? She is Korean.

663
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,831
What's important is that she appreciated
the gesture I made,

664
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,958
and that's more than I can say for some people.

665
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,836
Thanks for getting me fired.

666
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,072
Hey.

667
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,532
Hey. Thank you for coming down.

668
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:34,201
Yeah, no problem. You got something for me?

669
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:37,455
Yeah. I probably shouldn't even be doing this,

670
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,206
because it violates everything I believe in,

671
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,626
but I have to get my employees' money back, so...

672
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,295
This is Shaw's travel schedule for the last 10 years.

673
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,922
It's his guest registry. Names of judges, politicians,

674
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,924
women, tail number of his plane,

675
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,718
hull identification number of his yacht,

676
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,553
names of his race horses in West Virginia...

677
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:53,888
Gill's Pride and Sunny Day.

678
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,307
Yeah, we have all that, Kovaks.

679
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,560
And eventually they're gonna
sell his planes and his yachts,

680
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:02,521
and his horses, and the bank is going to take it all.

681
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,231
You guys were his smallest account.

682
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:06,942
I'm sorry.

683
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,612
It's okay.

684
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,115
Thought I'd give it a shot.

685
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:16,911
Kovaks,

686
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:19,580
you wanna get drunk?

687
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:23,959
Thanks.

688
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,504
I've got to be honest with you, Kovaks.

689
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:30,299
The last time I drank this much at
a bar I made out with a fireman.

690
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:32,551
Really? How long ago was that?

691
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,261
Tuesday.

692
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,640
You know, you surprise me.

693
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:42,144
I saw the security tape of you beating
the shit out of Shaw's car.

694
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,729
That was badass.

695
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,483
Yeah, well, badass is my middle name.

696
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,860
Nope. Your middle name is Marvin.

697
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,405
I know that from your file. Marvin.

698
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,449
All right.

699
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,494
That's my dead grandfather you're laughing at.

700
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,287
What else is in my file?

701
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:01,706
Oh.

702
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,417
I know the year your parents got divorced.

703
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,377
Your SAT scores.

704
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,045
You don't know my SAT scores.

705
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,964
540, math. 480, verbal.

706
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,300
I retook those. Your scores went down.

707
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,432
I have to tell you something,

708
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,892
and I really shouldn't be telling you this,

709
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,895
because it violates everything I believe in.

710
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,397
Mmm-hmm.

711
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,983
We still haven't found Shaw's safety net.

712
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:33,779
All these guys, they keep some cash
close by in case they have to run.

713
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:36,407
Shaw clears out all of his accounts three months ago,

714
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,534
20 million and change.

715
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,786
But when we bust him, the money isn't on him.

716
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,163
Wait.

717
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,248
$20 million?

718
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,460
There's a chance we'll get lucky and find it.

719
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,672
And if we get lucky, maybe you can get lucky.

720
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,177
I'm not lucky.

721
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,429
You just have to be patient.

722
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,891
I don't really have time to be patient.

723
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:03,934
Well, if you're tired of waiting around,

724
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,187
you can always try the old-school approach.

725
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,354
What's that?

726
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:12,276
Grab some pitchforks and a couple
of guys and storm the castle.

727
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,528
They'd never see you coming.

728
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,655
I have to pee.

729
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,742
Ooh! I'm gonna... I have to go.

730
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,118
Whoa, whoa. You can't drive.

731
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:22,453
I'm gonna get a crab.

732
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,537
Crab?

733
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:27,124
Listen, you violated three federal laws

734
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:28,834
when you beat up Shaw's Ferrari.

735
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:30,836
So what?

736
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,839
So a lot of guys down at the bureau
want to buy you a drink,

737
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:35,382
and so do I.

738
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,680
Bye.

739
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:43,474
Goodbye.

740
00:35:58,657 --> 00:35:59,990
Manuel.

741
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,620
Sorry, Mr. K, I can't let you into the building.

742
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,872
No, no, I just have to grab some
stuff out of my office, okay?

743
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:08,040
I promise I won't attack anyone.

744
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,124
I can't do it.

745
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:14,463
Or should I tell Mr. Simon about
you and the cougar in 2813?

746
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,342
Two minutes. Okay.

747
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:01,719
Hi, welcome to Shake Shack. What can I get you?

748
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,178
Hey, Mr. Kovaks.

749
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:06,181
Welcome to Shake Shack. What's
shaking? We shake all day.

750
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:07,683
You like working here?

751
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,144
I cry at night.

752
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,980
You said you know electrical engineering?

753
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:17,234
I'm on the phone with the police.

754
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:19,737
They have a cruiser in the area. Go away!

755
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:23,198
It's me, Mr. Fitzhugh. Can you open the door, please?

756
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,288
Hey. Hey.

757
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,415
Why are you staying in this motel?

758
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,500
I'm thinking of becoming a male prostitute.

759
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,419
I think I might have a better idea.

760
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,105
Sasha told me you took a job.

761
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,900
Oh, yeah. I'm using all the skills
you taught me as a concierge.

762
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,235
Thank you very much. Hey, no spitting, blue shirt.

763
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,321
Suck it, douche bag!

764
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,739
It's not a bad job. Only problem is

765
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,783
I need 40 hours to get on the insurance,

766
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:08,035
it's hard to get shifts, but if I
don't get on the insurance,

767
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,411
it's probably gonna end up costing us

768
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:11,455
around $20,000 to have the baby.

769
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,083
So we'll probably have to sell it.

770
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,085
I need your help.

771
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:21,048
So you're saying you wanna rob
$20 million from Arthur Shaw.

772
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,258
Which you think he's hidden in a secret wall safe

773
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:24,885
inside his penthouse apartment.

774
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,512
An apartment which he's not allowed to leave

775
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,931
and is guarded by three FBI agents, 24 hours a day.

776
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,015
Two.

777
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,266
And you wanna do all of this in a building

778
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,601
with the most advanced security

779
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:34,019
and surveillance system in the world.

780
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:36,647
A building which we've all been barred
from ever entering again?

781
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,566
Yes. How do you guys feel about that?

782
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:42,486
Well, I've really enjoyed myself.

783
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,779
Thanks for the crackers.

784
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,906
Mr. Fitzhugh, I know the money is in that safe.

785
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,658
How do you know?

786
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,285
Because in 2003, Shaw remodeled.

787
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,664
He spent like 10 million to blow out
the kitchen, move the living room.

788
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,165
He even brought in some guy from China

789
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,583
to do a whole feng shui thing.

790
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,835
But he left one wall standing,

791
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,378
dead center in the middle of the apartment.

792
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,754
That's where he put the safe.

793
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,047
Maybe it's a load-bearing wall.

794
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:03,799
No. No, it isn't.

795
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,092
We have the same wall in my place.

796
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,844
We took it down when we first moved in.

797
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,013
The FBI can't find the money,
because he hid it in the wall.

798
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,264
I know it!

799
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,103
So you guys in or out?

800
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:17,438
Mr. Fitzhugh?

801
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,274
Come back to me.

802
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:23,027
Mr. Dev'Reaux?

803
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,821
You know how many weeks I'd have to
work at the BK to make 20 million?

804
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,157
18,600.

805
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,245
Charlie, come on.

806
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,706
Look at us. We're basically waiters.

807
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,751
That's what we do. We bring people
stuff. We don't take things.

808
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,419
You and I know the movements of every person.

809
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,087
We know the schedules, deliveries and codes

810
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:43,213
for every door and window.

811
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,716
We've been casing the place for over
a decade, we just didn't know it.

812
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,384
We didn't know it, because we weren't doing it.

813
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:48,927
But we were. No.

814
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:50,804
Okay, where do the Lippmans keep their passports?

815
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,723
In the freezer. Mmm-hmm.

816
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,808
How many in vitro fertilizations did Miss Hansen have

817
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,560
before she gave birth to Jonah?

818
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,103
Six. See? We know everything!

819
00:39:58,188 --> 00:39:59,980
What's the pass code for Mr. Shaw's elevator?

820
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,025
I just press the PH button.

821
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,403
Come on, man. I need you.

822
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:08,572
Yeah, you need me, because you've got these idiots.

823
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,865
You think we're getting our money back?

824
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,658
You think Lester is getting his money?

825
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,410
I talked to the FBI. It's gone!

826
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:15,871
So all this is about getting it back for Lester?

827
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:19,958
Yes! And Rose and Miss lovenko
and Manuel and you, you jerk!

828
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,212
Come on! Let's storm the castle together.

829
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,214
Oh, like when they went after Frankenstein?

830
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,673
No, it's a different kind of storming.

831
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,675
It's a storming where the peasants
take everything back.

832
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,135
From like the feudal lords and...

833
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,428
I'm in.

834
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:35,057
Holy shit! I'm in.

835
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:40,521
Well, now we're undefeatable, aren't we?

836
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:43,857
Josh, we're not criminals. We don't know how to steal.

837
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,193
It's okay, I know someone who does.

838
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,488
Crack four!

839
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,871
You must have been saying your prayers, Slide.

840
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,039
You made bail.

841
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:04,962
Slide.

842
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,634
Thought you might need a ride.

843
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,396
I haven't driven my Nova for a few months.

844
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:26,191
Did you know that in Spanish "No
va" means "It doesn't go"?

845
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,987
That's why they didn't sell many in Latin America.

846
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:34,992
I didn't realize Rikers was on an actual island.

847
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,995
I thought it was more of a... I don't know, like a...

848
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,831
You know, like the way Puget
Sound is actually an inlet.

849
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,332
But they...

850
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,794
You hungry? Can I buy you some lunch?

851
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:48,672
Slide, what are you doing?

852
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:49,756
Tell me why you bailed me out!

853
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,009
Take your foot off the gas!

854
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,427
Answer the goddamn question first!

855
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,595
Slide!

856
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:58,265
Red light!

857
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:06,440
All right, what's going on?

858
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,566
You wearing a wire or something?

859
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,775
Some kind of police undercover shit?

860
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,152
No, I'm not a cop!

861
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,112
Then you brought me out here for
some kind of freak shit, huh?

862
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:14,198
You want to stimulate my nut
sack. Is that what it is, punk?

863
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,574
No! Jesus!

864
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,993
Then what the hell we doing out here,
man? I don't even know your name.

865
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,995
I'm Josh Kovaks.

866
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,372
Man in the suit. We talk almost every morning.

867
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:23,957
How come you bailed me out, man?

868
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:27,586
I need help with something, and
I thought given our relationship

869
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,795
you might be willing to help.

870
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,714
Relationship? I ain't got no relationship with your ass!

871
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,798
Our history!

872
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,383
What history? I see you walking
by every now and then.

873
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:34,635
I say, "Hey, what's up, little biatch?"

874
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,053
Just another passer-by going by.

875
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,137
Just another nigger walking by.

876
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:39,389
You don't remember 1971? Mrs. Saltzburg?

877
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,142
We used to get dropped off at her apartment
every morning for day care.

878
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:44,603
In 1971 I'm six! How am I supposed
to remember some shit?

879
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,605
Come on, Darnell, Mrs. Saltzburg!

880
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,690
Heavy-set German woman, short goatee.

881
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:50,817
Man, you call me Darnell one more
time, I will beat you to death.

882
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,736
You don't remember Inch High, Private Eye?

883
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,446
Davey and Goliath? Remember Witchiepoo?

884
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,281
H.R. Pufnstuf. You got freaked out by her?

885
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:57,407
Remember that kid came over

886
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,993
and he stole my inhaler and I couldn't breathe?

887
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,704
I do remember you!

888
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:05,082
You the little seizure boy that was
having them seizures all the time!

889
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,250
No, I never had any seizures!

890
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,668
They were minor spasms of the throat.

891
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,378
And I remember you would start
foaming up at the mouth

892
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:11,213
and your eyes would go crooked. It was very scary!

893
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,506
There was no foaming. That was you!

894
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,341
A lot of people have asthma when they're kids.

895
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,260
It's not a big deal. I outgrew it. No. Seizure Boy.

896
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,470
You'd be on the floor rolling all around.
You was having seizures!

897
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,056
Asthma doesn't cause seizures, all right?

898
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,975
Oh, really? Then how come nobody
wanted to play with your ass?

899
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,101
Nobody wanted to have naptime with you,

900
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:25,435
nobody wanted to do coloring with you or nothing.

901
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,478
Because of your little seizures

902
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,021
and didn't nobody want to catch that shit!

903
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,523
I'm gonna ask you one more time, punk.

904
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,024
Why did you bail me out?

905
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,986
Because I have a job and I thought
that given your skill set

906
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,445
maybe you could help us out.

907
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,072
What kind of skill set is that?

908
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,034
Taking things that don't necessarily belong to you.

909
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:48,250
Oh, little Seizure Boy want to
try to rob somebody, huh?

910
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:50,877
What you trying to steal?

911
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,463
$20 million.

912
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,217
Let's go get something to eat.

913
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:08,353
Hey, guys, this is my friend Slide.

914
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,814
You kidding, right?

915
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,317
These ain't the guys you wanna try to do this job with.

916
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:16,445
Yes, this is Charlie and Dev'Reaux and Mr. Fitzhugh.

917
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:17,654
This is a joke, right?

918
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:18,905
This guy is the big time criminal?

919
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:19,990
Hey, what you say?

920
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,451
All right, guys, take it easy. He's totally qualified.

921
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:23,994
He's been arrested a bunch of times,

922
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,079
he pays no income taxes, he's
got two Doberman pinschers.

923
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:27,289
So let's show him some respect.

924
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,458
So now we're like The Doberman Gang?

925
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,584
Like the what?

926
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:33,503
It was a movie. They trained Dobermans
to knock off a bank.

927
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:36,048
Is that the one where Gregory Peck
was attacked by those dogs?

928
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:38,508
No, that's Boys from Brazil with the cloned Hitlers.

929
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,552
Oh, shit. You guys ever seen Boys Don't Cry?

930
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,721
When Hilary Swank plays that dude.

931
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,097
That scared the shit out of me.

932
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:46,933
Wait, Slide. Sit down and talk with us for a second.

933
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,643
These guys ain't got what it take.

934
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:49,895
I can look in their eyes and see it.

935
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:52,064
First sign of trouble, they're gonna
be shitting in their pants.

936
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:53,607
They will not. You don't know them.

937
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:55,108
You want me to prove it?

938
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,194
All right, listen up,

939
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,821
y'all got 15 minutes to go out there
and steal me something.

940
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:00,947
What do you mean?

941
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:03,158
You heard what I said. In this mall,
right now, each one of y'all

942
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,660
go out there and individually steal
$50 worth of merchandise,

943
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:08,413
come back and put it on the table. Then we'll talk.

944
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,584
Okay, 50 bucks, no problem. Come on.

945
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:13,794
Can I go with you, Josh?

946
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,462
No, you ain't going with Josh, you go by yourself.

947
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,546
Everybody going by theirself.

948
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:17,714
Anybody can't handle this, is out.

949
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:18,924
Okay. Guys, we can do this.

950
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,717
It's just shoplifting. You got 15 minutes, let's go.

951
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:22,719
And put your wallets on the table.
I don't want nobody cheating.

952
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:25,222
I don't want y'all to go buy the
shit and say you stole it.

953
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,474
All right, come on, let's go.

954
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:38,485
This is a part of our Sexy Little Things collection.

955
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:42,906
Oh, yeah, that's great. Love that. Yeah.

956
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,450
Would you like me to ring that up for you?

957
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:49,204
No, I think I'll just live with it a little first.

958
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:05,720
These are very pretty Bella earrings.

959
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,681
They're from our Timeless Collection.

960
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,891
Do you have any studs?

961
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,601
Yes, several.

962
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,061
Right here.

963
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,355
Do you have any hoops?

964
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:18,859
Sir, all of our earrings are on this display.

965
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:22,487
Do you have a catalog?

966
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:23,572
Uh...

967
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:26,533
I might have one in the back, let me check.

968
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:36,293
How do those feel?

969
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:39,463
They feel a little tight. Do you
have them in a half size up?

970
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,715
Yeah, let me check the back.

971
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,106
Hey, them two pairs of drawers don't cost no $50.

972
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:44,236
$12 scented candle.

973
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:48,406
Okay, we'll get to work tomorrow.

974
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,200
Wait a minute. We all just proved ourselves.

975
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,785
How do we know you can really pull this off?

976
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,079
You each stole $50 worth of shit,

977
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:56,122
I stole $264 in cash.

978
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,792
Rule number one, never give your wallet to a thief.

979
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:00,877
Later, bitches.

980
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,260
What are we doing up here, man?
My balls are snow cones.

981
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:09,469
Can I get my jacket?

982
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:11,388
Everybody shut up, right now.

983
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,978
In a robbery, things can change quickly.

984
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,939
It can go from hot to cold, just like that.

985
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:24,025
You have to be ready to adapt to the situation.

986
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,236
You have to be able to think on your feet.

987
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,155
I was on a job a few days ago where
my homie got shot in the face.

988
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:30,490
He's kidding, right?

989
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:31,866
Get shot in the head, it's over.

990
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:34,202
If you get shot in your head, it's over.
If you get shot in your face,

991
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:36,371
the bullet will go in your cheek,
then come out the other side.

992
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:37,789
Then what you gonna do, sissy?

993
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,624
Die. I'm gonna die.

994
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:41,626
I saw a television show once

995
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:44,170
about a guy who got shot in the head with a nail gun.

996
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:45,880
He couldn't even remember how to chew anymore.

997
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:47,382
He had to put everything in a blender.

998
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:49,092
Yo, he couldn't figure out how to chew,

999
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,510
but he could operate a Cuisinart?

1000
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:51,970
I don't think he operated it himself.

1001
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,972
All right, could we just focus, please? It's 16 degrees!

1002
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,515
That's right! Let's focus!

1003
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,933
Now, earlier today I taught you all

1004
00:48:57,018 --> 00:48:58,602
how to pick a lock with a bobby pin.

1005
00:48:58,686 --> 00:48:59,811
I want y'all to practice on this door.

1006
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:02,397
I've got bobby pins for all of
y'all. Here's your bobby pin.

1007
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,982
This is your bobby pin.

1008
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,900
Here's your bobby pin.

1009
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:08,820
This is your punk-ass bobby pin. Take it!

1010
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:12,365
You unlock the door, you won't freeze to death.

1011
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:16,536
I'm gonna be inside having sex with Rita.

1012
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:20,540
Who's Rita?

1013
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:23,585
To get in the building, we have to
avoid seven exterior cameras

1014
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:27,088
and six doormen who work at two
entrance points in rotating shifts.

1015
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:29,549
Once inside, we'll be faced with four security officers,

1016
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:32,052
who monitor a bank of 12 internal cameras,

1017
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,762
as well as two floating security guards,

1018
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,347
who vary the patrol route each day.

1019
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:36,473
If we make it through all of that,

1020
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:37,682
we still have to get through this gauntlet

1021
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:39,392
of employees to get to the elevators.

1022
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:40,477
Questions?

1023
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:42,479
Yeah. Who's that girl in the red dress?

1024
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:44,147
She got the kind of titties I like to play with.

1025
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,399
That's Mary-Ann from sales. She's a lesbian.

1026
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:47,692
Okay, that's irrelevant.

1027
00:49:47,777 --> 00:49:48,985
Mary-Ann is a lesbian?

1028
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:50,862
She was married when she sold me my unit.

1029
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,031
She makes lesbian sex with Lynn
Rutherford from accounting.

1030
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,325
Okay... Lynn is a lesbian?

1031
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,534
Wait, I'm lost.

1032
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,828
How many lesbians total do we have to avoid?

1033
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:00,497
None. We're not avoiding lesbians.

1034
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:03,917
I don't avoid lesbians at all. I seek lesbians out.

1035
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:05,627
Lesbians got the nicest titties.

1036
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:07,379
Straight women, they have guys

1037
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:09,714
pulling and yanking on them and sweating on them.

1038
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:12,217
Lesbians get touched delicately by other lesbians.

1039
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:13,593
It's nice.

1040
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:15,220
Did anybody take in what I just said?

1041
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:17,138
Well, it seems like there's a gauntlet of lesbians.

1042
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:18,556
No. The...

1043
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,308
All right, I'm just gonna keep going.

1044
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:28,983
1:27, NYPD makes third pass in front of the building.

1045
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,318
The parking enforcement officer

1046
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:32,112
only works the west side of the street.

1047
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:33,780
She got a fat ass, too.

1048
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,198
All right, baby, I'll call you after lunch.

1049
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,533
I'm in a restaurant with Josh

1050
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:38,910
and a couple of other guys across from The Tower.

1051
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:40,912
Yeah. I love you.

1052
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,042
What are you doing? It's supposed to be a secret.

1053
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:49,045
I can't tell my wife I'm having a lunch?

1054
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:51,756
We're not having lunch. We're casing
the front of the building.

1055
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:53,341
Now they can trace our steps back to us.

1056
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:54,968
I didn't tell her what restaurant we were at.

1057
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,720
You said, "The restaurant across from The Tower."

1058
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,763
I didn't say which restaurant across from The Tower.

1059
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:01,933
Geez, a hamburger's $24. We can't
afford to eat here anyway.

1060
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,561
Hey, we can order whatever we like, because

1061
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:06,730
Lunch is on me.

1062
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,944
This is the main electrical room.

1063
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,405
You can override the elevators from
here or shut them down completely.

1064
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,949
Mr. Dev'Reaux, who took some courses
at DeVry Technical Institute,

1065
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,284
is gonna be our point man on this.

1066
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:21,077
Online. What?

1067
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:24,080
I went there to go get my master's in electronics,

1068
00:51:24,165 --> 00:51:26,916
but somebody said, "You got to go to college first."

1069
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,210
I was, like, "Yeah, it wasn't in the brochure."

1070
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,756
Okay, but you understand what...

1071
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,843
Absolutely. I weld stuff and I'm,
like, you flip it on and off.

1072
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,178
It's all about power.

1073
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:43,933
Hey, man, how is this supposed to be
right if you made it out of Legos?

1074
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,852
Well, the dimensions are completely accurate.

1075
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,229
Yeah, who's this little nigglet? Webster?

1076
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:50,648
Man, you might as well use Lincoln Logs or Tinkertoys.

1077
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:51,941
I got your ski caps.

1078
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:53,193
What?

1079
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:55,862
No, no, no. Ski masks. Masks.

1080
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,031
Yeah, but the guy said that these
were the warmest ever made.

1081
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,449
With pompoms? You serious?

1082
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,577
You're such an idiot. I need a mask.
It has to cover your face.

1083
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,330
Josh, let's say we get the money

1084
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:06,831
and make it outside, then what?

1085
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,417
Slide is the only one with no connection to The Tower.

1086
00:52:09,502 --> 00:52:11,294
So he's agreed to hold the money for a week.

1087
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,421
Are you crazy? You're gonna give this guy $20 million?

1088
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:14,464
He's a crook!

1089
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,966
What you say? Say it again. I didn't hear shit.

1090
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:18,593
Speak into the microphone! - Hey! Hey!

1091
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,844
Why don't you say it again, punk?

1092
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:21,429
Come on, Slide, no guns.

1093
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,264
You running things now, huh?

1094
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,766
Man in the suit got it all figured out?

1095
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,518
No, man in the suit doesn't have it all figured out,

1096
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:27,977
but man with the gun needs to understand

1097
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:29,938
what man in the suit is trying
to accomplish here, all right?

1098
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:31,022
Why you talking like that?

1099
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,233
You were talking like that! Why can't I talk like that?

1100
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:35,360
What you think, this is a joke, Josh?
We gonna just walk in there

1101
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:37,278
and roll this dude for $20 million without a fight?

1102
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,156
Look, no guns. End of story, all right?

1103
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:41,908
What if we run into some shit in there we don't expect?

1104
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,493
Trust me, there won't be any surprises.

1105
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:52,377
It's the FBI lady and two cops.

1106
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:54,379
Shit! We haven't done anything yet.

1107
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:56,673
We're plotters. We've plotted. That's a crime, right?

1108
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:57,799
Is that a crime?

1109
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:58,883
Everybody, just relax.

1110
00:52:58,968 --> 00:53:00,343
You relax! I'm out on bail.

1111
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,178
I'm gonna go in the closet. I'm coming with you.

1112
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:03,972
Guys, it's okay, I think she's here for me.

1113
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:05,139
Go find your own spot.

1114
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:12,397
Hey, Agent Denham, what a surprise.
What's with the police?

1115
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,440
Josh, Arthur Shaw is gonna walk.

1116
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:16,401
What?

1117
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,736
The judge is gonna dismiss the
case next week at his hearing.

1118
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,154
They're acting like he's untouchable.

1119
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,740
That's it? He just gets away with it?

1120
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:23,825
That's not it.

1121
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,035
He's threatening to press charges against you.

1122
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,079
He wants you to answer for the Ferrari.

1123
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,455
So they're here to arrest me?

1124
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,125
He says he'll drop the whole thing if you apologize.

1125
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,459
A sincere apology,

1126
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,545
that's what Shaw wants.

1127
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:36,796
And if I don't do it?

1128
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,591
Then these gentlemen will read you your rights.

1129
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:02,071
You know what's considered the greatest
move in the history of chess, Josh?

1130
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,907
A man named Frank James Marshall

1131
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:06,576
was losing to a man named Levitsky in 1912,

1132
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,578
world championship in Helsinki.

1133
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:13,917
And it looked like Marshall had no chance
until he moved 23 queen G-3.

1134
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,419
He deliberately sacrificed his queen

1135
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,630
and the move was so shocking and surprising

1136
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:20,798
that Levitsky never got over it.

1137
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:23,426
He lost the game two moves later.

1138
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:28,056
And the move became known in the annals
of chess as the "Marshall swindle."

1139
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:34,479
I'm a very good chess player, but I'm no swindler.

1140
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:38,983
What you did to my Ferrari was
the move of a small man.

1141
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:42,987
But now it's my move, and I'm not
sure how I want to play this.

1142
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:47,033
All I'd like to say, Mr. Shaw,

1143
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,285
is someday I'm gonna find a way to make things right.

1144
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:51,120
I don't care what I have to do,

1145
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:52,497
I will find a way to pay you back

1146
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:53,915
for everything that has been done.

1147
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:58,086
Good, because I know how difficult it must be for you

1148
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:00,630
to lose a service job like this at your age.

1149
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:05,134
And one day when all this is ancient
history, I hope you can come back,

1150
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:06,970
maybe not as a building manager at first,

1151
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:09,889
but somewhere where you can
start over, earn our trust.

1152
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:11,391
A doorman, for instance.

1153
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:16,396
Now go home and practice your chess game.

1154
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,732
I'll study the "Marshall swindle," sir.

1155
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:22,944
Anybody can sacrifice their queen, Josh.

1156
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,531
The real trick is getting away with it.

1157
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:34,664
Thanks for the ride.

1158
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,541
Any time. Oh, God, wait a minute,

1159
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,918
before you go, this is for you.

1160
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,337
It's a present.

1161
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:43,673
It's the footage of you beating
the shit out of Shaw's car.

1162
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,259
I took it from the security camera in his apartment.

1163
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:49,095
You committed larceny for me?

1164
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,181
Let's just say, I misplaced three minutes of footage.

1165
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,309
Thank you. I'm touched.

1166
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:57,687
You're welcome. Okay.

1167
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,780
Are you working on Saturday night?

1168
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:09,365
I'm always working.

1169
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:10,700
Call in sick.

1170
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,620
You're asking an FBI agent to lie?

1171
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:17,290
I'm asking an FBI agent to dinner.

1172
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,169
I'll see you Saturday night.

1173
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:22,503
Good.

1174
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:30,303
What the hell is that in your hand?

1175
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:32,764
It's a present.

1176
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:33,973
She gave you a present?

1177
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:35,349
I don't know about the other guys,

1178
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:37,560
but I don't want you seeing the federal agent anymore.

1179
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,062
I'm not seeing her until Saturday night.

1180
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:40,521
Oh, my God! He's dating her.

1181
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:43,441
Relax, my social life and my criminal
life are totally separate.

1182
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:44,776
They're not separate if you're dating

1183
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,819
the FBI agent who busted Arthur Shaw!

1184
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,821
Shouldn't we be avoiding law enforcement?

1185
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,656
I never saw an episode of Matlock

1186
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:52,492
where the criminal banged Matlock!

1187
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,786
Well, it don't matter. Is this the safe?

1188
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:56,412
Yeah.

1189
00:56:56,497 --> 00:56:58,498
Then we have a really serious problem.

1190
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,878
You saying you can't open it?

1191
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:06,047
No, I'm saying I never worked
on a safe like this before.

1192
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,381
I usually break into strongboxes.

1193
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:09,342
You never said it was a real safe made out of steel.

1194
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:10,927
We're going after $20 million.

1195
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,011
What did you think it would be? Wood?

1196
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:13,971
What kind of thief can't open a safe?

1197
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:15,681
Well, generally I rob balconies.

1198
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,600
Balconies? Like a cat burglar?

1199
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,477
That way I never get charged
with breaking and entering.

1200
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,145
And I never steal nothing over $1,000,

1201
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:23,189
because in New York that shit is a felony.

1202
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,108
What do you get? Like potted plants?

1203
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:27,276
No, bitch! I don't be stealing no potted plants!

1204
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,112
I steal mostly satellite dishes.

1205
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:31,405
I got a friend of mine who be
hooking up illegal DirecTV.

1206
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:33,324
Hey, can your friend hook me up?

1207
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,951
No! This is a bunch of horseshit.

1208
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:36,327
Your thief isn't even a thief.

1209
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,496
Hang on a sec. You can figure this out, right?

1210
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,248
No, I can't figure this out.

1211
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:42,458
I'm serious. You have to find a actual safe-cracker.

1212
00:57:42,543 --> 00:57:43,793
Where am I gonna find a safe-cracker?

1213
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,920
I don't know. You have to start
thinking outside the box.

1214
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:49,924
Shit, you got to find somebody with
some safe-cracking history. Think!

1215
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:54,554
So, Odessa, I think we should address
the elephant in the room.

1216
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,973
What the hell you just call me?

1217
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:59,642
No, no. I'm talking about the anger you have for me.

1218
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,018
How you blame me for losing the pension,

1219
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:03,020
which is the last thing I ever wanted to happen.

1220
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,815
I know you're a good man, Mr. K,

1221
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,441
even though you ruined my life.

1222
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:09,193
Which is why I invited you here.

1223
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,028
When I hired you, I made a note that

1224
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:12,655
you worked for your father in Kingston.

1225
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:13,906
He was a locksmith.

1226
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:15,658
Yes, the best in Jamaica.

1227
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:16,742
Uh-huh.

1228
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,870
Did he teach you how to open locks

1229
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:20,580
and doors and things like that?

1230
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,999
There ain't no lock I can't get by, Mr. K.

1231
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:28,504
I was just wondering, do you think
you could open this thing?

1232
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:32,008
That safe has a six-number wheel
pack with a double-action fence.

1233
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:34,051
Very tricky spindle.

1234
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,970
Probably take me 15 minutes to open.

1235
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,473
Fifteen minutes? Could you show us?

1236
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:42,602
What's in it for me?

1237
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,523
2:42, Lester at his post.

1238
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,112
Couple of NYPD officers at the falafel cart.

1239
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:57,825
Wait a second.

1240
00:58:58,285 --> 00:58:59,785
That's Charlie.

1241
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:03,456
What's Charlie doing here?

1242
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:06,751
Yeah, why is Charlie going into The Tower?

1243
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,593
What did you do?

1244
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:19,889
I went to talk to Mr. Simon. He called
me, said he had a job for me.

1245
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,808
He wants me to be the building manager.

1246
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:25,144
He asked you to be the building manager?

1247
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:28,231
Yeah, he offered me your job, so I took it.

1248
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,775
That's ridiculous! You're not qualified.

1249
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:34,278
But it's not ridiculous for you to rob $20 million?

1250
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:36,405
I can't believe how irresponsible you're being!

1251
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,532
You really think that you're gonna just stroll in there

1252
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:40,576
like Robin Hood and his band of merry doormen

1253
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:42,787
and outsmart the guys with ear pieces and guns?

1254
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:44,872
Why is that so hard for you to believe, huh?

1255
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:46,874
Why can't you just be my skinny Friar Tuck?

1256
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,793
Come on! Who's Friar Tuck?

1257
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:51,128
Friar Tuck is the guy who helps Robin Hood!

1258
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:53,297
I can't do this, Josh.

1259
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:56,634
You put one foot inside The Tower,
I'm gonna call in a Code Blue.

1260
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,219
It's black. It's Code Black!

1261
00:59:58,345 --> 00:59:59,929
You call it black, I call it blue.

1262
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:03,683
Maybe I made up new codes, because
I'm in charge of The Tower now.

1263
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:07,228
I'm warning you, Josh, come
near, it's a Code Blue-Black.

1264
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:15,528
First thing you do, you have to find the entry point.

1265
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,990
You have to use your fingers when
you find the entry point.

1266
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,868
It's all in the touch.

1267
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,579
You married?

1268
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:28,499
Say what? You married?

1269
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,378
No, I ain't married.

1270
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,714
What's up?

1271
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:37,133
Just taking a poll.

1272
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:38,342
Taking a poll?

1273
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:40,219
I'll take your poll.

1274
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,309
Why did you call me here?

1275
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:47,810
I got a call two hours ago

1276
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,520
from Judge Hollingsworth's clerk.

1277
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,981
They're moving Arthur's court date up to Thanksgiving.

1278
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,065
Thanksgiving?

1279
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,234
The judge wants to avoid a media circus on this,

1280
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:57,320
let him walk as quietly as possible.

1281
01:00:57,988 --> 01:00:59,280
It's an act of contrition.

1282
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:00,948
By the way, Agent Denham,

1283
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:04,243
I'll be pressing charges against
Josh and all his accomplices

1284
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:06,037
the moment I step out of court.

1285
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:09,332
Come on, he did what you asked, he apologized.

1286
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:12,710
It's time everyone paid for their mistakes.

1287
01:01:13,754 --> 01:01:14,795
I agree.

1288
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:21,302
Hello.

1289
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:22,970
There's something that you need to know.

1290
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:27,391
They moved Shaw's court date up to
Thursday, and he's coming for you.

1291
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:28,893
You'll be in jail by the weekend.

1292
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:31,228
That really messes up our plans, doesn't it?

1293
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,816
Josh, you need to get yourself a lawyer.

1294
01:01:36,485 --> 01:01:37,818
Take care.

1295
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:43,449
Great news, it worked.

1296
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,118
We're good for Thanksgiving.

1297
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,547
My sister will be taking the Q train

1298
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:00,007
to my uncle's house in Brighton.

1299
01:02:00,092 --> 01:02:01,425
She cooks for him every year.

1300
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,052
How am I gonna know what she looks like?

1301
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,470
Here.

1302
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:05,971
Got it. Okay.

1303
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:16,232
"I know some of you believe I'm the reason

1304
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:19,693
"Paul McCartney didn't buy an apartment here in 2008.

1305
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:21,070
"Maybe I did get a little confused

1306
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,322
"about the meaning of the word 'wanker.'

1307
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:26,325
"Maybe you heard about the Mrs. Jin incident.

1308
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,620
"I know that I'm not Josh Kovaks.

1309
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,415
"But today I am your leader.

1310
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:35,376
"And today is Thanksgiving, the toughest
day of the year for The Tower.

1311
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,712
"Forty-three parties, close to 500 guests, 30 caterers,

1312
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:41,215
"all of Garage 2 blocked until 4:00.

1313
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:44,260
"Today, you might say, is our Super Bowl.

1314
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:48,055
"Today, you might say, we will not lose."

1315
01:02:51,143 --> 01:02:52,143
Booyah.

1316
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:14,832
The start of Macy's Thanksgiving Day
parade is just moments away.

1317
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,334
Three million people will line the streets of this city.

1318
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:19,336
Fifty million more will watch from homes

1319
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:21,839
all across the country and around the globe.

1320
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:24,800
When the parade begins, all eyes turn to the sky

1321
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:28,137
as the largest balloons in the
world soar above this city.

1322
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:31,223
It's a sight that brings out the child in all of us.

1323
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:53,954
Hey, Josh, here's your sister's phone.

1324
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:54,997
Great.

1325
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,457
She's really hot, by the way.

1326
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:10,930
Watch your head, Mr. Shaw.

1327
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,308
Where's Slide?

1328
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:15,684
He's supposed to be here.

1329
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:25,027
They're on the move.

1330
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:28,113
Wait a sec.

1331
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,659
Oh, God. - What?

1332
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,410
What is it? It's Slide.

1333
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:34,620
Is he coming up here?

1334
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,539
Shit! - What is he doing?

1335
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:37,623
He's wearing my suit.

1336
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:39,458
He stole my suit.

1337
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:42,086
He's heading for The Tower.

1338
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,587
Well, that's not the plan.

1339
01:04:43,672 --> 01:04:45,798
How do you forget a plan? Didn't he write it down?

1340
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:46,882
He didn't forget it.

1341
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:48,384
All that time he spent with Odessa,

1342
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:49,802
he thinks he can open the safe.

1343
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:50,970
I don't understand.

1344
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:52,388
He's going for the money.

1345
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:53,973
Didn't I tell you he would screw us?

1346
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:55,808
What are we gonna do?

1347
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,227
We stick to the plan.

1348
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,145
We go on Snoopy.

1349
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:06,735
Holy shit! You guys are not gonna believe this.

1350
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:09,029
That girl that moved into 4811?

1351
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:10,906
She's in French Playboy this month.

1352
01:05:10,991 --> 01:05:14,326
And in French Playboy, they're even more naked.

1353
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:17,663
Mrs. Goshen is looking for a Turkish loose tea,

1354
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,999
an orange pekoe or mint melody.

1355
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:22,751
Well, just send her an assortment, Rose.

1356
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:25,588
"I'm at Lenox Hospital, my water broke."

1357
01:05:27,716 --> 01:05:29,300
It's happening. Rose, cover for me.

1358
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:30,926
I'm having a baby. I'm having a baby!

1359
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:32,094
Excuse me. I'm having a baby.

1360
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,001
Guys, check it out. Snoopy.

1361
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,961
I like Snoopy.

1362
01:06:06,046 --> 01:06:07,713
Yeah, it's Snoopy.

1363
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:10,007
- Snoopy! - Snoopy!

1364
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:26,190
It's Huang's birthday! Everybody come and sing.

1365
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:28,734
Ron, Manuel, come and sing.

1366
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,362
Come on, everybody. Everybody
come on, come on now.

1367
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:32,863
Everybody come on now.

1368
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:40,663
So what happened to Mr. Larkin?

1369
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:42,164
We had to fire Mr. Larkin.

1370
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,041
He was involved with some illicit sexual behavior

1371
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,085
that we at Chase Manhattan just will not tolerate.

1372
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:48,295
If you wanna wear a black leather
hood and whip your own ass,

1373
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:50,339
work at Bank of America.

1374
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:54,134
So you'll be taking over his account, Mr. Davis?

1375
01:06:54,219 --> 01:06:56,136
Yes, I will. Working holidays?

1376
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:57,846
We've been very patient with you

1377
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,849
with regard to the Fitzhugh foreclosure,
but the bank is ready to sell.

1378
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:02,685
And we'd like to personally offer you a finder's fee

1379
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:04,353
if we can move the remodel along.

1380
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:05,938
A finder's fee? Mmm.

1381
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,357
We just started demolishing the apartment.

1382
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,566
The place is gonna look like new.

1383
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:11,694
It's going to be one of the finest units of the building.

1384
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:13,195
I'd love to see it. Can I see it?

1385
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,864
Here you go. There you go.

1386
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:33,006
Well, looks like the staff is having a little party.

1387
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,102
We were supposed to be in that elevator.

1388
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,437
Come on.

1389
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:51,692
We have to go up. Let's go.

1390
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,652
All the way to the top?

1391
01:07:55,155 --> 01:07:58,866
So, as you'll see, this entire
apartment is being redone.

1392
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,785
All new appliances.

1393
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:04,413
Floor-to-ceiling windows.

1394
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:05,914
Hardwood floors.

1395
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:07,583
Oh, hardwood floors. That's nice.

1396
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:09,084
Tell me, are you gonna do the closets over?

1397
01:08:09,169 --> 01:08:10,252
Yes, right this way.

1398
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:11,336
Oh, yes. This way.

1399
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:14,089
This is the master bedroom closet.

1400
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:15,758
It'll have new sliding racks.

1401
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:18,761
And what beautiful doors. Are these
doors made of mahogany?

1402
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:21,930
Mr. Davis?

1403
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:24,349
Excuse me, Mr. Davis. I'm locked in the closet.

1404
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:27,227
Hello?

1405
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:04,389
Sorry, no cleaning now.

1406
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,642
It's okay, I'll come back.

1407
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:07,893
Do you want some cake?

1408
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,645
We're celebrating a birthday downstairs.

1409
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:10,729
No, thank you.

1410
01:09:11,022 --> 01:09:12,773
It's amazing cake, are you sure?

1411
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,650
I'm allergic to chocolate.

1412
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:16,610
I break out in hives. I can't touch it.

1413
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:27,162
Bumbaclot!

1414
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,166
You should have tried the cake, man.

1415
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:53,272
Odessa, did he take the cake?

1416
01:09:53,982 --> 01:09:56,149
He's allergic to chocolate. I had to beat him.

1417
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:29,391
Oh, shit.

1418
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:30,726
The maid has gone rogue!

1419
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,811
Put him in the chair.

1420
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,656
Very spacious.

1421
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:06,178
Got it! Come on.

1422
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:37,709
Yeah.

1423
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:42,464
This is incredible. Yeah.

1424
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:45,717
I have to hand it to you, Mr. Kovaks, you were right.

1425
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:47,719
Move away from the safe.

1426
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:50,973
I ain't gonna say it again. Back up!

1427
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,308
Are you serious? What are you doing?

1428
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:54,559
Hey, Josh, I'm a thief.

1429
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:56,645
I keep telling you I'm a thief, but
you don't want to believe it.

1430
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,563
I know exactly what I am. You're
the one that's confused.

1431
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:01,149
Now back up before I pop a cap in your ass.

1432
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:02,234
No.

1433
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:04,152
No?

1434
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:05,278
Yeah, no.

1435
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:08,156
Look at my face.

1436
01:12:08,408 --> 01:12:09,449
You see how serious I am.

1437
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:10,826
I'm pretty serious, too.

1438
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:11,952
Are you ready to die, bitch?

1439
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:13,203
That's my suit.

1440
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:16,289
Yeah, I got on your suit and your drawers
and socks, too! So what?

1441
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:17,416
I want my suit back.

1442
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,794
I will blow your face clean off your face! Now, back up!

1443
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:23,171
You think I'm gonna let this shit get away?

1444
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:24,923
You don't have a choice.

1445
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:26,466
I brought my own gun.

1446
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:28,635
Now put your shit down, nice and slow.

1447
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:36,977
You mess with me, you're a dead man. Now drop it!

1448
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:38,145
Okay, all right, all right, all right.

1449
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:39,479
I'm putting it down right now.

1450
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:41,189
Take it easy.

1451
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:47,404
On the ground, you punk-ass bitch!

1452
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,698
Bitch, on the ground! We had a plan! Take it easy.

1453
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:51,867
We had a plan! Fitz, calm down.

1454
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:53,368
Come on now. Shit! Fitz, take it easy.

1455
01:12:53,453 --> 01:12:54,703
Be cool with the gun, man. Okay. All right.

1456
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:55,746
Relax.

1457
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,748
I'm relaxed, you relax!

1458
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:02,586
You sissy... You bitch!

1459
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:17,642
Ladies and gentlemen, America's queen of comedy,

1460
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:19,311
Joan Rivers.

1461
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:21,980
And here's Kanye West.

1462
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:24,816
Charlie, what are you doing back?

1463
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:26,985
Rose, please. I feel like my head's gonna fall off.

1464
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:29,738
I raced over to the hospital, she's
not there. I can't find her.

1465
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:31,114
I get into an argument with 15 doctors.

1466
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:33,075
I said, "Where's my wife?" They
said, "Your wife's not here."

1467
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:34,242
I called my Uncle Marty in Brighton.

1468
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:35,368
I say, "You got to get over here.

1469
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:36,661
"She's not here. Nobody can find her."

1470
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:37,788
He said, "What do you mean no one can find her?

1471
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:39,414
"She's in the television room, watching television."

1472
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:41,041
I said, "Are you kidding me? Put her on the telephone."

1473
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:42,084
He puts her on the telephone.

1474
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:43,877
I said, "What are you doing? Your water didn't break?"

1475
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:45,462
"No." "Your vagina's not dilated?" "No."

1476
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:46,630
I said, "Why did you send me a text message?"

1477
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:50,884
She says, "I didn't send you a text
message. I can't find my phone!"

1478
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:53,386
Have you seen Josh?

1479
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:58,058
Manuel, will you show me the penthouse hallway?

1480
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:03,021
These FBI guys are always falling asleep.

1481
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,649
Where is Mr. Simon?

1482
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:09,277
He was showing Mr. Fitzhugh's
old apartment to some guy.

1483
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:14,241
Manuel, do you think something strange is going on?

1484
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:17,786
They cut Miss Piggy from the parade.

1485
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:19,704
I think that's strange.

1486
01:14:27,839 --> 01:14:30,882
Well, it's been nice meeting you, Agent Denham.

1487
01:14:31,259 --> 01:14:34,928
You know, I'm still trying to decide
if I should go after your badge.

1488
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:37,722
Either way, no hard feelings on my part.

1489
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:41,685
Maybe we could have dinner sometime, my treat. Huh?

1490
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:53,989
Can I help you?

1491
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:55,907
We have a meeting with Judge Hollingsworth.

1492
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,409
Judge Hollingsworth is down in D.C.

1493
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,703
He goes down every year to spend
the holiday with his daughter.

1494
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:00,829
Are you sure?

1495
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:02,831
There's no one here today, ma'am. It's Thanksgiving.

1496
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:04,833
What the hell is going on?

1497
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:05,959
Back in the car.

1498
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:07,502
Wait, no. Wait a second. Back in the car.

1499
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:09,087
Wait a minute!

1500
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:15,093
Three, four, five,

1501
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:17,679
six, seven, eight.

1502
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:22,934
You open it, Mr. K.

1503
01:15:31,903 --> 01:15:32,861
Wow.

1504
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:34,154
Oh, my God.

1505
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:36,656
This can't be real.

1506
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:42,287
Empty! After all this shit, it's empty.

1507
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,164
Man, what kind of...

1508
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:46,166
Give me my gun back.

1509
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:48,001
This is over. Give me my gun...

1510
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:50,003
I might need it to get out of here.
I'm not giving it to you.

1511
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:52,047
Stop bullshitting and give me
the gun. No! I don't want to.

1512
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:53,673
Give me the goddamn gun! Fitz, give him the gun!

1513
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:55,800
Give him the gun! Guys. Guys!

1514
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:57,135
What the hell is wrong with you, man?

1515
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,386
You gonna kill somebody in here!

1516
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,555
Sorry. - What the hell, man?

1517
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,314
Give me that crowbar.

1518
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,776
What? Did you find something?

1519
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:20,242
What is that? Gold.

1520
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:22,327
- Real gold? - Holy shit.

1521
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:25,205
The hood is solid gold. Do you have
any idea what that's worth?

1522
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:29,000
It's not just the hood. It's the whole car.

1523
01:16:29,669 --> 01:16:31,211
This is where he hid the money.

1524
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:35,298
This car must weigh 2,000 pounds.

1525
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:38,093
Sixteen ounces to a pound, that's 32,000 ounces.

1526
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:41,471
The current price of gold is $1,872 per ounce.

1527
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:44,641
Josh, it's about 45 million.

1528
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:46,893
Jesus! $45 million?

1529
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:48,853
Give or take 10 million.

1530
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:51,273
Give me that crow bar. I am going
to break a chunk off this bitch.

1531
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:52,607
Are we going to chop it up?

1532
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:54,359
How we gonna do that?

1533
01:16:55,403 --> 01:16:56,444
Why don't we take the whole thing?

1534
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:57,570
What?

1535
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:59,864
What are we gonna do? Roll it out the front door?

1536
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:01,032
It's not gonna fit.

1537
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:03,076
It is too big. It won't go through the door.

1538
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,119
Man.

1539
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:06,288
And the doors in Fitzhugh's apartment are torn out.

1540
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:08,164
Too bad it is six floors down.

1541
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:09,666
Shit!

1542
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:13,461
How much you say it weighs?

1543
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:42,574
It has to be green, because green means go.

1544
01:17:48,748 --> 01:17:50,248
It's moving.

1545
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,424
This is crazy.

1546
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:08,933
Josh, this is really crazy.

1547
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:15,065
Okay, all right.

1548
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:16,441
- Got it? - Yeah.

1549
01:18:19,779 --> 01:18:21,112
All right.

1550
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,535
Hey, do you know of any reason

1551
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,871
somebody would want you out
of your penthouse right now?

1552
01:18:30,748 --> 01:18:31,998
No.

1553
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:36,378
Mr. Shaw, I think you're being robbed.

1554
01:18:44,595 --> 01:18:46,596
This is a bad idea. Really? Which part?

1555
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:47,680
The part where you screw us over

1556
01:18:47,765 --> 01:18:49,099
and try to take everything for yourself?

1557
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:50,809
Even when you were six you couldn't share.

1558
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:52,227
Maybe I just didn't want to share

1559
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:53,561
with your silly seizure-having ass.

1560
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:54,729
All right, you know what? That's it!

1561
01:18:54,814 --> 01:18:57,649
I don't want you talking to me
for the rest of the robbery.

1562
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,322
Okay, take it up.

1563
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:05,824
All right.

1564
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:30,181
All right, lower it.

1565
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,046
A little more. A little more.

1566
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:04,382
Okay, stop!

1567
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:07,469
Grab it, Fitz!

1568
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:11,347
You have to reach out and pull it in.

1569
01:20:12,475 --> 01:20:15,560
I really don't want to do that. I wanna go home now.

1570
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:17,896
Home to my old life.

1571
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:20,607
Do you have any idea how happy I used to be?

1572
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:23,318
My wife and I flew first class to Greece.

1573
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:25,904
We swam naked.

1574
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,407
We ate lamb.

1575
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:31,326
Stop acting like a bitch and pull that shit in!

1576
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,077
He's freaking out. We have to get down there.

1577
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:36,372
Shit.

1578
01:20:38,918 --> 01:20:40,001
What are you doing?

1579
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:41,794
That's it, we popped.

1580
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:42,921
We are not popped.

1581
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:44,005
What are you doing?

1582
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:45,673
I'm gonna shoot this guy in the foot when he comes in

1583
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:46,841
and you are gonna slam the door in his face.

1584
01:20:46,926 --> 01:20:47,967
No, that's a bad idea.

1585
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:49,844
You shoot the FBI agent in his
foot, he is gonna come in here

1586
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:52,180
and he is gonna shoot a nigger in his ass. It's over.

1587
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:53,306
All right, great. You give up then.

1588
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:54,390
I'm out of here. Hey!

1589
01:20:54,475 --> 01:20:56,768
I can do it. I'm no bitch.

1590
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:58,394
Yeah.

1591
01:21:03,943 --> 01:21:05,109
Okay...

1592
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:07,904
I can do it.

1593
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:10,698
It's kind of like sailing.

1594
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:22,293
Keep moving!

1595
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:23,711
Easy! Easy! Easy! Easy!

1596
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:26,130
I'm not going out there.

1597
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:43,439
I got it!

1598
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:46,568
Oh, no.

1599
01:21:53,701 --> 01:21:54,909
Yo, we got a dangler!

1600
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:56,661
Help me!

1601
01:21:57,663 --> 01:21:58,830
Fitzhugh is dangling!

1602
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:00,582
- Shit! - Fitz!

1603
01:22:04,503 --> 01:22:05,670
Help!

1604
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:07,714
I'm gonna fall!

1605
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:10,133
Josh, help me!

1606
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:13,761
I don't want to die.

1607
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:16,889
There's a rope.

1608
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:18,683
Grab the rope!

1609
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:22,061
I can't!

1610
01:22:22,146 --> 01:22:23,730
Listen to me. No!

1611
01:22:23,814 --> 01:22:26,399
Take your hand off the car and grab the rope!

1612
01:22:27,318 --> 01:22:29,193
It's your only chance!

1613
01:22:36,243 --> 01:22:38,286
Yeah! Reach out!

1614
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:45,126
It's too far!

1615
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:46,711
No, it's not!

1616
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:58,389
I got you. I got you.

1617
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:04,896
I got you. Come on.

1618
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,482
What are you doing, man?

1619
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:09,442
We're stealing the car.

1620
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:14,530
FBI, you got to let us through.

1621
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:17,241
Can't. The parade is coming right
at us for another half hour.

1622
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:19,744
You're gonna have to go around
the entire park. I'm sorry.

1623
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:27,919
Holy shit! Whoa!

1624
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:30,296
Josh.

1625
01:23:30,381 --> 01:23:33,299
Fitzhugh! What's happening? Are you okay?

1626
01:23:33,801 --> 01:23:36,177
Come in. Fitzhugh!

1627
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:37,261
Dev'Reaux.

1628
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:38,596
Charlie?

1629
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:41,683
Where are you? The roof!

1630
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:43,351
We need to swing the car over to the window.

1631
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:51,901
Dev'Reaux, I'm gonna try and reel the car in,

1632
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:54,028
but I'm gonna need your help.

1633
01:23:57,241 --> 01:23:58,783
I'm starting to get kind of queasy.

1634
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:01,119
Fitzhugh, get the rope. We're gonna hook it.

1635
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:06,290
I'm gonna call Ralph. What?

1636
01:24:06,834 --> 01:24:08,501
I'm getting ready to call Ralph. Who's Ralph?

1637
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:22,640
Pull!

1638
01:24:30,858 --> 01:24:31,899
Hi, guys.

1639
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:33,401
God damn it, Josh.

1640
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:35,653
You realize what you have done
to me? You have ruined my life.

1641
01:24:35,863 --> 01:24:37,572
Do you understand that I'm a part of this now?

1642
01:24:37,656 --> 01:24:39,365
And for what? So you could steal a car?

1643
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:41,451
Yeah, worth 45 million, made out of gold.

1644
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:43,161
Gold?

1645
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:44,662
It's worth 45 million?

1646
01:24:44,997 --> 01:24:46,247
Give or take 10 million.

1647
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,041
All right, come on. Let's push it into the elevator.

1648
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:50,710
I don't think it's gonna fit.

1649
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:53,004
No, it won't fit in the elevator.

1650
01:24:53,881 --> 01:24:55,506
But it doesn't have to.

1651
01:25:08,896 --> 01:25:11,981
I'm stopping the elevator right under you guys.

1652
01:25:15,194 --> 01:25:17,445
Okay. So what do we do when we get it downstairs?

1653
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:19,197
We'll think of something. Check the glove box.

1654
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:21,032
Keys have to be here somewhere.

1655
01:25:23,786 --> 01:25:27,038
I don't see any keys. Nothing.

1656
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:39,592
Holy shit!

1657
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,052
Josh.

1658
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:44,055
Can you take Lucy on a walk for me?

1659
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:49,018
My feet are swollen, and there's a goddamn parade.

1660
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:52,063
You know, now is not a great time, Mrs. Cronan.

1661
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:53,397
Charlie,

1662
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:57,401
give her one of those liver treats
that you keep on your desk.

1663
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,487
Yes, ma'am.

1664
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:01,072
Thank you.

1665
01:26:14,253 --> 01:26:16,170
Agent Claire Denham requesting backup

1666
01:26:16,255 --> 01:26:18,172
at The Tower on Central Park West.

1667
01:26:35,357 --> 01:26:36,566
Okay.

1668
01:27:01,174 --> 01:27:04,135
All right. On three. One, two, three.

1669
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:05,887
Come on.

1670
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:07,555
Easy, easy, easy!

1671
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:10,349
Okay, it's stable.

1672
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:12,143
That wasn't so bad.

1673
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:17,815
Whoa!

1674
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:21,819
What's happening? Why are we moving?

1675
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:24,113
It's security! They're overriding me!

1676
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:39,962
It's the lobby.

1677
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:42,548
Shh!

1678
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:09,951
Fitz. Take her! Take Lucy! Here.

1679
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:11,118
What? What?

1680
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:13,037
Okay. I got her.

1681
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:26,550
No, no. No!

1682
01:28:26,677 --> 01:28:28,219
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

1683
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:43,651
I think they're gone.

1684
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:45,069
We need to get out of here right now.

1685
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:47,196
Slide. Yeah.

1686
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,198
We got to use the truck. Where are the keys?

1687
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:50,658
Under the sun visor.

1688
01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:52,743
You leave the keys? In New York?

1689
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:54,161
It's a stolen car.

1690
01:28:54,413 --> 01:28:57,081
You brought a stolen car to a robbery?

1691
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:00,459
Lester, you still there?

1692
01:29:00,711 --> 01:29:03,129
Yeah, I'm here. I'm holding
four cabs at the north door.

1693
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:04,296
Slight change of plan.

1694
01:29:04,381 --> 01:29:07,425
There's a white truck parked on 60th
and Broadway, keys on the visor.

1695
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:08,676
You got to back it up to the elevator.

1696
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,760
I'm on my way.

1697
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:31,240
Mr. Shaw, tell me about this safe.

1698
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:32,491
It's empty.

1699
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:34,994
Doesn't matter if it's empty or full.

1700
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:36,537
A hidden safe was never mentioned

1701
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:38,456
in the inventory of your apartment.

1702
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:39,915
You neglected to inform us,

1703
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,043
which is a violation of your parole, therefore...

1704
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:44,045
Where is my car? Where is my goddamn car?

1705
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:48,299
I hereby remand you to federal custody
until your real court date.

1706
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:50,217
You just forfeited $10 million.

1707
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:52,261
You think I care about $10 million?

1708
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,555
You think I care if I spend a few nights in jail?

1709
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,474
We both know I'm going to be out by the weekend.

1710
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:58,601
But you let that car leave this building

1711
01:29:58,685 --> 01:30:00,978
and I promise you won't get off so easy.

1712
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:03,522
Take him away. Lock it down.

1713
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:06,484
This is Agent Huggins. Lock down the building.

1714
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:18,204
Show me the garage.

1715
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:20,122
Okay. Yes, ma'am.

1716
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:25,211
They got the car. Come on! Come on!

1717
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:42,937
There they are!

1718
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:44,438
Here we go, baby.

1719
01:30:50,529 --> 01:30:51,779
Move out of the way.

1720
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:54,990
Go. Go.

1721
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:04,875
Get out of the way!

1722
01:31:10,423 --> 01:31:12,842
Careful. Careful. Jesus Christ!

1723
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:21,350
Freeze! Do not move!

1724
01:31:23,562 --> 01:31:24,812
Open it.

1725
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:34,238
Son of a bitch! It's a diversion.

1726
01:31:39,703 --> 01:31:42,121
Lester, they are gonna get hurt.
There is no way out of this.

1727
01:31:42,789 --> 01:31:44,373
I don't know what you are talking about.

1728
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:47,668
All I did is steal a truck and try to commit suicide.

1729
01:32:00,265 --> 01:32:02,641
Mr. Fitzhugh? FBI. You're under arrest, sir.

1730
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:03,767
Oh.

1731
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:06,562
Please put your hands behind your back.

1732
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:10,733
Miss Montero, FBI, you're under arrest.

1733
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:15,196
Charlie Gibbs, FBI, you're under arrest.

1734
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:16,614
You have the right to remain silent.

1735
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:18,157
Anything you say, can and will be

1736
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:19,992
used against you in a court of law.

1737
01:32:20,076 --> 01:32:21,493
You have the right to an attorney.

1738
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:27,625
Mr. Dev'Reaux, FBI. Show me your
hands. You're under arrest.

1739
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:40,387
Show me your hands, Josh.

1740
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:45,100
It was smart.

1741
01:32:45,644 --> 01:32:49,438
Thanksgiving, the parade, changing the court date,

1742
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:53,067
using Lester as a diversion, lying to me.

1743
01:32:54,361 --> 01:32:57,112
We have reservations Saturday night
at six different restaurants.

1744
01:32:57,197 --> 01:33:00,115
I'll give you the names if you wanna check.

1745
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:02,952
That's okay, I trust you.

1746
01:33:28,895 --> 01:33:30,104
Where is my car?

1747
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:34,441
Do you mean the car made of gold?

1748
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:37,361
Gold melted down from the money you stole?

1749
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:38,529
I haven't seen it.

1750
01:33:38,989 --> 01:33:40,572
They'll find it.

1751
01:33:40,991 --> 01:33:44,118
And when they do, my friends on the
bench will take no pity on you.

1752
01:33:44,411 --> 01:33:46,704
They'll make sure you go away for a very long time.

1753
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:49,081
See, you people are working stiffs,

1754
01:33:49,416 --> 01:33:50,791
clock punchers.

1755
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:52,626
Easily replaced and erased.

1756
01:33:53,253 --> 01:33:55,296
And just know that while you are all sitting in jail,

1757
01:33:55,672 --> 01:33:57,131
I'll be right up there in the penthouse

1758
01:33:57,215 --> 01:33:59,341
of The Tower, doing what I do best.

1759
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:01,760
We may be going to jail for a few years,

1760
01:34:01,845 --> 01:34:05,222
but you, you're going for the rest of your life.

1761
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:06,890
How'd you figure that?

1762
01:34:07,225 --> 01:34:08,392
I found your ledger.

1763
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:10,311
You know, the one that you stuck

1764
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:12,438
in the owner's manual of your Ferrari.

1765
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:13,731
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1766
01:34:14,024 --> 01:34:15,774
I'm guessing you don't really care about the car.

1767
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:17,693
You could care less about 45 million,

1768
01:34:17,777 --> 01:34:20,321
but I bet you want that ledger back.

1769
01:34:20,947 --> 01:34:22,281
Am I right?

1770
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:23,532
What do you think you're doing?

1771
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:27,911
Sacrificing my queen.

1772
01:34:32,459 --> 01:34:34,752
Okay, you and I are gonna make a deal, Josh.

1773
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:38,380
A deal that will make you and
your friends very wealthy.

1774
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:41,759
Do you think that car has value? Multiply it by 10.

1775
01:34:42,385 --> 01:34:43,719
In cash.

1776
01:34:48,266 --> 01:34:50,100
Dev'Reaux, will you please remind Mr. Shaw?

1777
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:55,105
I'm very sorry, Mr. Shaw, but we
don't accept tips at The Tower.

1778
01:34:59,152 --> 01:35:00,486
Checkmate.

1779
01:35:08,411 --> 01:35:09,828
Hello!

1780
01:35:15,502 --> 01:35:18,170
We've got FBI agents and police all over the city.

1781
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:20,297
We know about your friend Slide from Astoria.

1782
01:35:20,673 --> 01:35:22,007
Your little trick with Lester may have

1783
01:35:22,092 --> 01:35:23,342
gotten the car out of the building,

1784
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:26,637
but it's just a matter of time before we find it.

1785
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:29,723
Who is this?

1786
01:35:29,808 --> 01:35:30,849
Director Mazin.

1787
01:35:31,101 --> 01:35:33,394
I am Mr. Kovaks' attorney, Miss lovenko.

1788
01:35:33,478 --> 01:35:35,729
I will be representing all the defendants in this case.

1789
01:35:37,649 --> 01:35:40,401
And you're licensed to practice
in the state of New York?

1790
01:35:40,902 --> 01:35:43,320
I passed the bar three days ago.

1791
01:35:47,867 --> 01:35:50,494
I'd like to request the immediate
release of all the defendants.

1792
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:53,122
On what grounds?

1793
01:35:57,377 --> 01:35:59,044
These are Mr. Shaw's hand-written notes

1794
01:35:59,129 --> 01:36:01,088
detailing his fraudulent business practices.

1795
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:03,090
There are names, dates, account numbers.

1796
01:36:03,174 --> 01:36:04,633
My guess is you'll find enough evidence in there

1797
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:06,009
to put him away for a very long time.

1798
01:36:06,094 --> 01:36:09,012
But this only happens if my clients walk.

1799
01:36:09,973 --> 01:36:11,682
You've been a lawyer for less than a week

1800
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:14,518
and you're trying to bribe the
United States government?

1801
01:36:15,478 --> 01:36:17,688
Sharks are born swimming, sir.

1802
01:36:24,988 --> 01:36:26,864
I'll let everyone walk but Kovaks.

1803
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:31,493
As a first-time offender, he'll probably
get two years for the car.

1804
01:36:32,245 --> 01:36:33,620
Best I can do.

1805
01:36:39,461 --> 01:36:41,295
Nobody else will be charged?

1806
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:46,300
New evidence in the Arthur Shaw trial

1807
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:49,470
has prompted a new plea from the accused swindler.

1808
01:36:49,554 --> 01:36:51,722
Sources are now confirming that Mr. Shaw

1809
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:54,141
will enter a guilty plea next week.

1810
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:00,898
Are we gonna do this or what? Mmm-hmm.

1811
01:37:15,246 --> 01:37:16,747
Hallelujah!

1812
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:27,174
Welcome to the penthouse, Mr. Shaw.

1813
01:37:28,134 --> 01:37:29,718
Look who's coming now.

1814
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:34,097
Wait until I get a hold of your wrinkled ass.

1815
01:37:34,182 --> 01:37:36,099
He looks good!

1816
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:47,528
Are you Rose Demato? Yes.

1817
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:49,071
Sign right here, please.

1818
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:52,366
All right, thanks.

1819
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:17,975
It's a gold wheel!

1824
01:38:30,259 --> 01:38:40,259
