1
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,446
<i>Wind's in the east,</i>

2
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,087
<i>mist coming in,</i>

3
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,046
<i>like something is brewing,</i>

4
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,446
<i>about to begin.</i>

5
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,202
<i>Can't put my finger</i>

6
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,568
<i>on what lies in store,</i>

7
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,602
<i>but I feel what's to happen</i>

8
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,645
<i>all happened before.</i>

9
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,727
- Mr. Russell.
- Mrs. Travers.

10
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,401
Like pink clouds on sticks.

11
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,159
Excuse me?

12
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,570
The cherry blossom. I was trying
to think of what it looks like.

13
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,765
The car should be here by now.

14
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,559
May I use the phone?

15
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,879
I canceled it.

16
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,081
You...

17
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,125
What?

18
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,719
Pamela?

19
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,919
"Mrs. Travers."

20
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,281
Mrs. Travers,

21
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,199
why would you cancel the car?

22
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,079
I shan't be going.

23
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,566
We've been through this.

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,399
I've changed my mind.

25
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,045
You made an agreement.

26
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,806
You understand?
A verbal agreement.

27
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,519
Why in the world are you speaking
to me as if I were a neonate?

28
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,599
- He's going to...
- What?

29
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,839
What is he going to do? Sue?

30
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,199
He's very welcome to
every penny I don't possess.

31
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,481
Look.

32
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,047
I've represented you
for a long time.

33
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,679
I like to think of you as a friend.

34
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,439
Yes, I like to think it.

35
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,041
Believe me,
I know it's not reciprocated.

36
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,279
I would never suggest anything
that would cause you anguish,

37
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,891
but there's no more money, Pamela.

38
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,239
"Mrs. Travers."

39
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,601
Simply no more.

40
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,719
Sales have dried up,
no more royalties.

41
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,127
You refuse to write
further books, so...

42
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,439
Do you understand? I...

43
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,959
I'm frightened you don't
understand what that means.

44
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,919
I know what he's going to do to her.
She'll be cavorting and twinkling,

45
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,719
and careening towards a happy
ending like a kamikaze!

46
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,439
We've been trying to do
this deal for 20 years.

47
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,919
He's agreed to both
your stipulations.

48
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,439
No animation, script approval.

49
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,719
Use her to pay my bills?

50
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,039
If I believed in a hell, I'd be
sitting in its waiting room.

51
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,159
Script approval!

52
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,399
He's never granted anything
like that before!

53
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,762
I don't know what else to do!

54
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,804
- Where's Polly?
- I fired her.

55
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,919
It's just as well.

56
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,964
It seems I can't afford
her anymore, anyway.

57
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,522
You don't know what
she means to me.

58
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,839
Polly?

59
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,246
Of course not Polly!

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,361
Sake!

61
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,568
Los Angeles.

62
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,841
You only have to
go and work there for two weeks.

63
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,201
Collaborate.

64
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,199
You haven't signed
over the rights yet.

65
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,359
Yet?

66
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,999
You must make this work,
Mrs. Travers.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,199
- Oh, I must, must I?
- You need the money!

68
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,679
- I don't want to see you go broke.
- Stop saying money!

69
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,199
It's a filthy, disgusting word!

70
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,279
I'm picking up the phone now,
Mrs. Travers.

71
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,721
I have final say.

72
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,321
You do.

73
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,004
I have final say.

74
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,559
And if I don't like what
they're doing to her...

75
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,842
Then you don't sign the papers.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,601
He can't make the film
unless you grant the rights.

77
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,767
It's an exploratory trip.

78
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,921
What do you say?

79
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,605
I want to keep my house.

80
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,039
Excuse me, ma'am.

81
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,527
Have you seen my daughter?

82
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,804
I was quite sure I left her
around here somewhere.

83
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,199
Her name is Helen.

84
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,368
No, uh... "Shirley."

85
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,126
Uh, no... Um...

86
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,919
Huh.

87
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,442
Good Lord, I've quite forgotten.

88
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,039
Could it be "Prunella"?

89
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,241
No.

90
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,599
"Pamela"?

91
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,881
No, no, no, no.

92
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,439
I'm sure I have a
special name for her.

93
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,719
"Ginty"!

94
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,119
Why, thank you, ma'am!

95
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,599
"Ginty" it is, of course. Yeah.

96
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,801
Now, have you seen her?

97
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,730
It's me.

98
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,447
Gosh, so it is.

99
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,844
Thank goodness for that.

100
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,643
Oh, I was positive I was going
to be beheaded for losing

101
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,039
Her Highness,

102
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,801
The Royal Princess
Ginty McFeatherfluffy!

103
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,959
Don't lose me.

104
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,161
Never.

105
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,000
I promise.

106
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,079
I'll never lose you.

107
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,559
You ready? Are you sure?

108
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,527
All right, the adventure's
about to begin. Come on.

109
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,319
Up!

110
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,010
There we go.

111
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,559
Can I help you?

112
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,239
I'm perfectly capable, thank you.

113
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,839
They've used all the space.
So greedy.

114
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,679
I'll take it, madam.
I can put it up in front.

115
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,679
I don't want it up in front.
I would like it here

116
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,599
in the corresponding holding
area for my assigned seat.

117
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,239
The flight's closing
in just a few moments, madam.

118
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,279
- I'll have to take it.
- Ah, ah, ah!

119
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,359
You can move mine instead.
It's the gray one.

120
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,971
Thank you.

121
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,006
Thank you.

122
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,639
Will the child be a nuisance?

123
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,205
It's an 11-hour flight.

124
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,319
I don't...

125
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,521
Jolly good.

126
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,928
I hope we crash.

127
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,199
Where's the carriage?

128
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,482
Carriage? Who needs a carriage?

129
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,799
But, darling, we have so many...

130
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,083
A leisurely stroll is a gift,
darling! It's a gift!

131
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,199
Now, Biddy, are you staying?

132
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,719
- Mmm-mmm.
- You're coming with us?

133
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,445
- Mmm-hmm.
- Excellent!

134
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,761
All right.

135
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,844
Thank you so much.

136
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,761
For everything.

137
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,719
- Thank you, miss.
- All right.

138
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,924
Hurry up, everyone.
We mustn't be late for the train.

139
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,039
All aboard! Everybody ready?

140
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,605
Yes.

141
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,239
See you soon, Katie Nanna.

142
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,839
Take care, love.

143
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,964
All right. Everybody ready?

144
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,919
Walking bus!

145
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,999
- Left, right, left, right...
- Miss!

146
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,247
- Miss!
- Oh.

147
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,044
Thank you.

148
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,999
Left!

149
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,399
Left, right, left.

150
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,399
And one, two, three.

151
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,519
New town, new job,
new bank, new life!

152
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,927
Come on, my little ducklings!

153
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,641
Right, left!

154
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,279
Come on! Come along! Come along!

155
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,768
Halt!

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,531
"Allora."

157
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,279
Ginty. Come on, my love.

158
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,490
Mmm...

159
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,159
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

160
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,091
<i>we are beginning our descent
into Los Angeles.</i>

161
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,411
Oh, he does, does he?

162
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,479
Travers? P.L. Travers?

163
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,399
- "Mrs."
- Okay.

164
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,159
Well, welcome, Mrs. P.L. Travers.

165
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,759
Welcome to the City of Angels.

166
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,479
Let me take those for you.

167
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,079
- I'm perfectly capable...
- Come.

168
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,611
Oh, never mind.

169
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,399
The sun came out
to say hello just to you.

170
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,284
Don't be preposterous.

171
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,439
It smells, like...

172
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,962
- Jasmine.
- Chlorine and sweat. Ugh!

173
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,766
It's dreadful.

174
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,201
Ugh!

175
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,279
Absurd.

176
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,599
Are you all right back there,
Mrs. P.L. Travers?

177
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,079
It's not "Mrs. P.L."

178
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,879
It's just "Mrs."

179
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,921
It's so hot.

180
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,129
Oh. No problemo!

181
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,479
No problemo.

182
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,160
We got a brand new
air conditioning system, Mrs.

183
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,799
Yeah.

184
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,159
Just about make you feel like

185
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,919
you're in good old
Eng-er-land again!

186
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,559
I tell you, the things they
can put in cars these days.

187
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,000
Gosh almight...

188
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,525
No problemo.

189
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,330
And here we are, ma'am.

190
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,919
Thank you.

191
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,201
Ma'am?

192
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,004
Would you like me
to unpack for you, ma'am?

193
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,279
Young man, if it is your ambition
to handle ladies' garments,

194
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,131
may I suggest you take
employment in a launderette.

195
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,801
Odd.

196
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,883
Odd, Odd.

197
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,203
Oh, dear.

198
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,722
For heaven's sake.

199
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,241
What on earth is...

200
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,001
How...

201
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,885
What on...

202
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,159
No, no, no. This will never do.

203
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,559
Absolutely no pears.

204
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,046
No pears.

205
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,569
A palace.

206
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,965
Complete with mighty steed.

207
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,964
And chickens.

208
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,919
Oh, my.

209
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,159
Oh, we'll make beautiful
memories here, my angel.

210
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,521
Come on.

211
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,959
- All right?
- Mmm.

212
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,889
Girls. Come on.

213
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,402
In this house,
you get to share a room!

214
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,441
Good riddance.

215
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,651
Now...

216
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,330
I'll take care of this.

217
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,124
How old do they think I am?

218
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,808
Five years old, or something.

219
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,079
Poor A.A. Milne.

220
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,566
Ghastly business.

221
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,570
Duck, dog, out.

222
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,560
Much better.

223
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And you can stay there until
you learn the art of subtlety.

224
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,559
Oh!

225
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,444
<i>Lassie!</i>

226
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,519
Ah!

227
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,599
There you are.

228
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,839
<i>Don't worry.</i>

229
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,199
<i>There's nothing wrong
with your television set.</i>

230
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,719
<i>This is a pixie bell.</i>

231
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,764
<i>The sound is much too high
for human ears.</i>

232
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,319
<i>Oh!</i>

233
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,284
<i>There you are, Tink.</i>

234
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,241
<i>Hey!</i>

235
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,486
<i>Hey! Get that stuff off of me!</i>

236
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,599
<i>You know, if you're familiar
with our story of Peter Pan,</i>

237
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,839
<i>you know a little sprinkling
of Tinker Bell's fairy dust</i>

238
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,327
<i>can make you fly. Huh.</i>

239
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,679
<i>Where are you going, Tink?</i>

240
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,919
<i>Haven't you forgotten something?</i>

241
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,167
Off!

242
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,768
That's how we deal with you.

243
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,159
Good morning, Mrs.

244
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,679
It's not "Mrs." It's...

245
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,166
Never mind.

246
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,808
We're just not going
to get it right, are we?

247
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,650
What's that?

248
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,279
Will it be the same
driver every day?

249
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,563
Yes, ma'am. I am all yours.

250
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,130
Hey, sun came out again.

251
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,199
You say it as if you're surprised.

252
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,719
As if the sun were particular
about for whom it appears.

253
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,599
It seems that you think
that I am responsible

254
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,959
for its miraculous
dawning every day.

255
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,764
For heaven's sake, it's California.

256
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,324
Certainly is.

257
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,879
I'd so much rather be
accountable for the rain.

258
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,206
Oh, that's sad.

259
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,799
Sad is entirely the wrong emotion.

260
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,279
I shan't bother explaining why.

261
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,839
It would just... Zip!

262
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,008
Huh. Okey-dokey.

263
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,171
The rain brings life.

264
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,171
So does the sun.

265
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,999
Be quiet.

266
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,690
Yes, ma'am.

267
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,047
I'll get that, sir.

268
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,324
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

269
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,565
Good morning, Pamela.

270
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,279
It is so discomfiting to
hear a perfect stranger

271
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,999
use my first name.

272
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,679
"Mrs. Travers," please.

273
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,359
I do apologize, Mrs. Travers.

274
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,359
I'm Don DaGradi, the scriptwriter.

275
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,519
Co-scriptwriter.

276
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,279
I shall certainly be having
my say, Mr. DiGradi.

277
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,084
"DaGradi."

278
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,359
Uh... Wonderful,
I welcome your input.

279
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,403
If, indeed,
we ever sign off on a script.

280
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,244
Right. Um...

281
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,679
This is the rest of your team.

282
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,799
This is Dick and Bob Sherman,
music and lyrics.

283
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,839
Boys, the one and only
Mrs. P.L. Travers.

284
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,202
The creator of our beloved Mary.

285
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,559
- Poppins.
- Who else?

286
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,240
"Mary Poppins."
Never, ever just "Mary."

287
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,719
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Hello.

288
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,519
I fear we shan't be
acquainted for very long.

289
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,559
Why is that?

290
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:02,559
Because these books simply do not lend
themselves to chirping and prancing.

291
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,839
No, it's certainly not a musical.

292
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,359
Now, where is Mr. Disney?

293
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,719
I should so much like to get
this started and finished

294
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,239
as briskly as is humanly possible.

295
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,799
Perhaps someone could point me
in his direction.

296
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,079
I'd be so grateful. Thank you.

297
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,079
We were hoping to give you
a little tour of the studio.

298
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,199
No, thank you.

299
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,528
Walt just wanted to
show the place off.

300
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,968
No one likes a show-off.

301
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,039
Mrs. Travers,
it's quite a long way.

302
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,810
Not a musical?

303
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,967
I am perfectly capable of walking.

304
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,561
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Dolly.

305
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,680
Could you let Mr. Disney know
I've arrived, please?

306
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,490
Absolutely. Please, have a seat.

307
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,171
Oh, no, there's no need.

308
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,725
He'll be just a moment,
Mrs. Travers.

309
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,645
Why don't we sit?

310
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,651
She's here.

311
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,119
Uh...

312
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,639
A word of advice,
Mrs. Travers, if I may.

313
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,282
You may. Whether I heed it or not
will be another matter entirely.

314
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,279
Wow.

315
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,959
Uh, it's just that

316
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,959
he can't stand being
called "Mr. Disney."

317
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,799
We're all on a first-name basis here.

318
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,007
Well, here you are at last.

319
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,965
Oh, my dear gal,

320
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,439
you can't imagine how excited
I am to finally meet you.

321
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,319
It's an honor, Mr. Disney.

322
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,919
Oh, "Walt." Now,
you gotta call me Walt.

323
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,959
Mr. Disney was my old man,
isn't that right, Don?

324
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,119
Absolutely, Walt.

325
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,599
Come here. Come here.

326
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,961
Tommie.

327
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,639
Say hello to the one and
only Pamela Travers.

328
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,002
It's so nice to meet you.

329
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,321
You know, I can't believe it.

330
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,799
P.L. Travers,
right here in my office.

331
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,401
After all these years,
almost 20 of them?

332
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,839
Mmm. Yes.

333
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,769
Twenty long years.

334
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,359
I wish you could have
seen me then, Pam.

335
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,319
Lean as a whippet, I was.

336
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,839
A racehorse.

337
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,359
Well, anyway.

338
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,879
Now, here you are, and look at you.

339
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,320
I could just eat you up.

340
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,322
Uh... That wouldn't be appropriate.

341
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,879
You know what... When Diane, here,

342
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,519
was about, uh, seven years old...

343
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,839
Oh, can I get you something
to drink? A coffee, or...

344
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,959
A pot of tea would be most welcome.

345
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,839
Anyway, she was about
seven years old

346
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,479
when I was walking past her room

347
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,999
and she was on her bed reading
to her sister, Sharon,

348
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,039
and those girls, they were just
giggling their little socks off.

349
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,319
- Tommie?
- Yes?

350
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,599
A hot tea for Pamela and me.

351
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,959
Right away, Walt.

352
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,571
Ah, you're a doll.

353
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,399
She is. She's a doll.

354
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:55,004
Anyways, I asked them, I said,
"Girls, what's so funny?"

355
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,879
And Diane said to me,

356
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,289
"Why, Daddy, Mary Poppins."

357
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,570
I didn't even know
what a Mary Poppins was.

358
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,879
But then she gave me
one of your books,

359
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,399
and, oh, by gosh, my imagination
caught on fire.

360
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,199
Absolutely on fire.

361
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,559
And those embers have burned
ever since, as you know.

362
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,999
I do. Yes.

363
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,159
Twenty years.

364
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,719
So you keep saying.

365
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,046
Pam,

366
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,199
a man cannot break a promise
he's made to his kids.

367
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,121
No matter how long it takes
for him to make it come true.

368
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,679
Now, you've kept me
dangling all this time.

369
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,484
But now, I gotcha.

370
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,679
"Gotcha," indeed.

371
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,599
Mr. Disney, if you have "dangled,"

372
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,279
it is at the end of a rope you
have fashioned for yourself.

373
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,239
I was perfectly clear
when you approached me 20 years ago

374
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,599
that she wasn't for sale.
And I was clear again

375
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,679
when you approached me
the following year

376
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,119
and clear again when you
approached me every annum

377
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,799
for the subsequent 18 years,

378
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,279
and quite honestly,
I feel corralled.

379
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,119
Oh, now, Pam, the last thing I want
to do is make you feel as though...

380
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,279
Would you mind? My name
is "Mrs. Travers." I do...

381
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,799
See, I promised them, Pam.
Now, that's a fact.

382
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,959
You got kids?

383
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,439
No. Well, not precisely.

384
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,439
I have never, and absolutely never,

385
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,959
gone back on a promise I made
to either one of my daughters.

386
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,639
Now, that's what being "Daddy"
is all about, right?

387
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,679
Is it?

388
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,319
See, our motion picture is not
just gonna make my kids happy.

389
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,959
It's gonna make
all kids happy. Adults, too.

390
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,119
Because my guys are
gonna do things with it

391
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,799
that are revolutionary, Pam.
Revolutionary!

392
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,639
Your Mary Poppins is gonna
literally fly off the pages

393
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,079
of your books.

394
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,239
Oh. Thank you, Tommie.

395
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,999
This magical woman who has
only lived inside your head,

396
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,239
well, you are gonna be able
to meet her, speak to her.

397
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,487
You're gonna hear her sing.

398
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,119
Now, the singing, I'm very
glad you've come to that.

399
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,322
Oh!
Milk in first, please.

400
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,165
Then the tea.

401
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,364
And a spoonful of sugar.

402
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,729
You don't intend for this
film to be a musical?

403
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,005
I absolutely do.

404
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,119
No.

405
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,845
- No?
- No.

406
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,164
Mr. Disney,
Mary Poppins does not sing.

407
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,319
Yes, she does.

408
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,119
- When?
- In your books.

409
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,527
No, those aren't songs.
They're recitations.

410
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,119
She's not a giddy woman.
She's doesn't jig about.

411
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,199
I mean, singing is frivolous.

412
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,839
It's wholly unnecessary in a
governess, an educatress.

413
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,879
No, it would simply ruin it.

414
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,731
I won't have her turned into
one of your silly cartoons.

415
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,879
Now, Pam...

416
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,251
I want you to know

417
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,879
that the last thing I would do,

418
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,399
the very last thing,

419
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,199
is tarnish a story
I have cherished.

420
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,679
Now, the pages of your books
are worn to tissue.

421
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,399
They are dog-eared and falling out,

422
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,679
because I have pored over them,
gripped and tormented.

423
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,962
Because I love her, Pam.

424
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,601
I love Mary Poppins.

425
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,444
And you, you have got
to share her with me.

426
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,970
And nothing happens
without your say-so.

427
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,199
Quite right.

428
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,439
It's all right here in
the rights agreement

429
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,879
that was approved by your agent.

430
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,079
Uh... Dermot?

431
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,281
"Diarmuid."

432
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,759
A live-action film. No animation.

433
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,644
Live-action. Here's a pen.

434
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,331
I'd like this on tape.

435
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,039
On tape?

436
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,119
Mmm. Your promise,

437
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,641
and all the conversations
we have here, on tape.

438
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,481
Uh-huh. There you are.

439
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,799
Mary Poppins and the Banks,
they are family to me.

440
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,759
I understand that. I do.

441
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,487
Well, then. Shall we begin?

442
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,169
Let's make something wonderful.

443
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,246
Well, let's see if
that's at all possible.

444
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,286
Whoa.

445
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,841
Damn.

446
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,370
Testing. One, two, three.

447
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,202
<i>Testing. One, two.</i>

448
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,319
What is all this jollification?

449
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,839
We've got a whole
script to get through.

450
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,371
It's gonna be a long day, Mrs. T.

451
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,759
Mrs. Travers.

452
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,359
You could save a starving country

453
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,959
with benefaction from
this room alone.

454
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,199
It's just, ugh, so vulgar.

455
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,199
Did you turn on the thing?

456
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,401
Uh...

457
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,525
Yes. Now, let us begin.

458
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,481
Mmm. So...

459
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,359
"Scene 1."

460
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,079
"Exterior, Cherry Tree Lane..."

461
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,248
"Ext"? What's "Ext"?

462
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,921
"Exterior."

463
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,563
It means
the scene takes place outside.

464
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,799
Oh, I see. It is an abbreviation.

465
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,279
I'm so sorry, Mr. DaGradi,

466
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,050
do you feel that you should be...

467
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,999
Oh. Please, be my guest,
Mrs. Travers.

468
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,039
I do think it's best.
I have the most practice.

469
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,959
Readings of my books, you know?

470
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,039
Absolutely.

471
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,599
Anyway. "Scene 1. Exterior.

472
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,199
"17 Cherry Tree Lane, London. Day."

473
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,719
Yes, that's good. That can stay.

474
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,879
That's just the scene heading.

475
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,519
Although, I do think we should say
"Number 17," instead of just "17."

476
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,679
It's proper, yes?

477
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,039
No one's gonna see it.

478
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,730
I will see it.

479
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,519
Write it down.
Write it down. Chop, chop.

480
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,919
Is that on the tape?
Have we got that?

481
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,399
Uh... Yes.

482
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,399
Very good. Onwards.

483
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,967
I'm sorry to interrupt.

484
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,319
- Is that a joke?
- Excuse me?

485
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,568
Do you think you are a comedienne?

486
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,079
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

487
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,719
Well, it's...

488
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,999
- Unbelievable.
- In the way.

489
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,999
Dolly, I think we're
all set with food.

490
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,406
Thank you.

491
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,559
"Scene 1. Exterior.

492
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:04,199
"Number 17, Cherry Tree
Lane, London. Day."

493
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,919
"Bert, a one-man..."

494
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,679
Oh, the rumor is
that this is to be your Mr. Van Dyke.

495
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,439
- Is that right?
- We do hope so.

496
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,319
Well, we'll see about that.
It's a horrid idea.

497
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,806
Dick is one of the greats.

498
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,481
Dick Van Dyke?

499
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,239
Yes.

500
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,684
Robert, my dear.

501
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,559
Olivier is one of the greats.

502
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,439
Burton, Guinness,
greats without question.

503
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,009
I can assure... I can assure you
that Dick Van Dyke is not.

504
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,126
Dick Van Dyke.

505
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,079
Uh... "Bert, a one-man band,
plays to a small gathering

506
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,959
"outside the gates to the park.

507
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,719
"Bert... Yes, Bert says..."

508
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,967
You can do Bert.

509
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,448
- Thank you. Um...
- Go on.

510
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,081
Guys, shall we

511
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,091
give it a whirl?

512
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,920
What's happening?

513
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,681
What are you doing?

514
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,319
"All right, ladies and gents,

515
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,599

516
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,119

"All right, here we go."

00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,848
<i>Room here for everyone

<i>The Constable's responstable</i>

521
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,679
<i>Now, how does that sound?</i>

522
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,962
No, no, no! No, no, no!

523
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,205
"Responstable"

524
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,846
is not a word.

525
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,361
We made it up.

526
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,406
Well, un-make it up.

527
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,722
"Responstable."

528
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,728
There's my girl.

529
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,918
Here's a good boy. Come on.

530
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:20,919
That's it, Albert,
give Ginty a smooch.

531
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,919
There you go. There you go.

532
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,441
Oh.

533
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,283
Poor old Albert.

534
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,679
He's your secret uncle, you know.

535
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,123
But a miserable, horrid witch
turned him into a nag.

536
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,450
Why did she do that?

537
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,121
She said she hated
the sound of his laugh.

538
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,039
Poor Uncle Albert.

539
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,239
Yeah.

540
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,805
How can we fix him?

541
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,131
We have to teach the witch
to be happy again.

542
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,439
How?

543
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,801
Well,

544
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,563
I'm not quite sure, darling.

545
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,160
Do you want to know
what it feels like to fly, Ginty?

546
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,799
Come on. Albert, you old nag.

547
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,081
Come here.

548
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,086
Up you come.

549
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,481
Three, two, one.

550
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,163
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.

551
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,645
Nobody walks.

552
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,361
A leisurely stroll is a gift.

553
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,050
Beautiful, ain't it?

554
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,328
If you like that sort of thing.

555
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,245
I do.

556
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,679
We do find it's helpful
to have a visual.

557
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,360
Plus, it's fun.

558
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,279
Oh, no, no.
No, no. Goodness me, no.

559
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,481
No?

560
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,601
The Banks' house
doesn't look like that. No, no.

561
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,239
Mmm-mmm.

562
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,920
My house is a terraced house

563
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,039
with a pink door, white-bricked,

564
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,279
with a crack in the gable.

565
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,165
Okay, we get it. The house
is not what you pictured.

566
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,079
The windows are lead-lined

567
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,679
and the flower boxes grow

568
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,559
pink nasturtiums to
go with the pink door.

569
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,079
Have we got that?

570
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,726
Oh, dear, it's all a big mistake.
It's all wrong.

571
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,119
It's all wrong?

572
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,759
Well, it's too grand!

573
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,359
The Banks are normal, everyday sort
of people, and this isn't normal.

574
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,686
This isn't "everyday."

575
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,285
They're not aristocrats.

576
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,446
Okay.

577
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,159
Oh.

578
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,759
Do I even have to say it?

579
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,799
I'm afraid so.

580
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,959
Why in the world have you made
Mrs. Banks a silly suffragette?

581
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,239
I wonder if Emmeline P.
would agree with that adjective.

582
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,159
Quite possibly, looking back.

583
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,839
It does seem strange

584
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,119
that Mrs. Banks allows her kids

585
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,519
to spend all of their time with the nanny,
when she doesn't have a job to speak of.

586
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,479
Are you calling
Mrs. Banks neglectful?

587
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,359
- Yep.
- No, of course not.

588
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,679
We just thought that giving her a
job would go some way to explain...

589
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,118
Being a mother is a job.

590
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:21,319
It's a very difficult job,

591
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,639
and one that not everyone is up to.

592
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,359
One that not everyone should have
taken on in the first place.

593
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,439
And I won't have her
called "Cynthia."

594
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,639
Absolutely not. it feels...
it feels unlucky.

595
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,047
It needs to be something warm.

596
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,523
Something a bit,
I don't know, sexy.

597
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,531
How about "Mavis"?

598
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,081
Uh...

599
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,679
- "Sybil"?
- Great.

600
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,999
- "Prudence"?
- "Gwendolyn"?

601
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,439
- Perfect.
- "Winifred."

602
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,879
"Winifred?" "Winifred."

603
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,366
I could go with "Winifred."

604
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,087
That's because it's very good.

605
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,519
This isn't Mr. Banks.
This isn't... This isn't him.

606
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,679
Uh, yes, that's Mr. Banks.

607
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,405
But he has a set of mustaches.

608
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,719
In the book, he has them.

609
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,239
I told the illustrator I did
not like the facial hair,

610
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,479
but she chose to ignore me.

611
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,479
Now this time around,
this is my film,

612
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,719
and I shall have my way.

613
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,079
Mrs. Travers, this is a
specific request from Walt.

614
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,281
Why?

615
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,639
- Well, I think he identifies...
- He didn't, he doesn't.

616
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,399
Mr. Banks is clean-shaven.

617
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,840
Does it matter?

618
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,927
Bob...

619
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,400
Does it matter?

620
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,767
Bob...

621
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,922
You can wait outside.

622
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,447
I shan't say it again, Robert.

623
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,359
What is wrong with his leg?

624
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,561
He got shot.

625
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,399
That's hardly surprising.

626
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,728
Can I expect any more drama
from anyone else?

627
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,330
Why do you do that?

628
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,450
For you, my dear.

629
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,325
Tell me, Gintamina,

630
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,808
which kind of kisses do you prefer?

631
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,639
Scratchy ones, or silky ones?

632
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,842
Silky ones.

633
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,165
Well, then, swish!

634
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,080
Swoosh!

635
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,320
A man must shave for to spare
his daughter's cheeks.

636
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,239
Swish.

637
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,680
Swoosh.

638
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,370
Swoosh.

639
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,479
<i>Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious</i>

640
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,011
Stop! Stop! Stop!

641
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,319
What on earth are
you talking about?

642
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,319
"Supercali..."? "Supercal..."?

643
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,159
Or whatever the infernal thing is.

644
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,679
It's something you say when
you don't know what to say.

645
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,689
Well, I always know what to say.

646
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,519
If you so much as step
one foot in here with that trolley,

647
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,199
I shall scream.

648
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,926
One cannot live on cake alone.

649
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,046
<i>Well, hit me with it.</i>

650
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,410
She has a lot of ideas.

651
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,199
Yeah? What kind of ideas?

652
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,005
The name "Cynthia" has been
changed to "Winifred."

653
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,891
Fine, fine, fine.

654
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,799
She won't approve Dick Van Dyke.

655
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,239
The sketches of the Banks house

656
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,519
make it look too opulent.

657
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,199
There must be no hint of romance

658
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,999
between Mary Poppins and Bert.

659
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,599
She wants to know why Mr. Banks
has been given a mustache.

660
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,801
Oh, I asked for that.

661
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,239
Yes, they told her that,
but she wants to know why.

662
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,363
Because I asked for it.

663
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,359
Right. Of course.

664
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,239
Uh, the tape measure
Mary Poppins uses

665
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,611
to record Jane and Michael's height
must be a roll tape, not a ruler.

666
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,559
She only wants
green vegetables and broth.

667
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,919
I don't know what that is,

668
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,079
but she wants it in the room
from now on.

669
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,399
And... Oh!

670
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,082
She doesn't want
the color red in the film.

671
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,719
At all.

672
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,241
I've simply gone off the color.

673
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,847
We can't make the picture
without the color red.

674
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,449
The film is set in London,
for Pete's sake.

675
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,119
And?

676
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,563
Well, there's buses and mailboxes

677
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,439
and guards' uniforms and things.

678
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,199
And heck, the English flag.

679
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,290
I understand your predicament,
Mr. Disney, I do.

680
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,165
Uh, it's just...

681
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,279
I don't know what it is.

682
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,079
I'm suddenly very anti-red.

683
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,123
I shan't be wearing it ever again.

684
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,119
Is this a test, Pamela?

685
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,119
Are you requiring proof as to how
much I want to make you happy,

686
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,607
so we can create
this beautiful thing together?

687
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,011
I took you at your word,
Mr. Disney.

688
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,319
And it seems my first
stipulation has been denied.

689
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,443
There will be many more.

690
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,279
So, perhaps we should
just call it quits

691
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,959
and I should hand you back these.

692
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,525
All right.

693
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,361
No red in the picture.

694
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,410
- Walt.
- Walt!

695
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,801
Wait.

696
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,010
He doesn't have the rights.

697
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,041
Quite.

698
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,406
Tommie?

699
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,204
Scotch Mist?

700
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,926
What do you think?

701
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,959
What do I think, what?

702
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,199
You're a woman.

703
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,687
Oh, that's a canny observation, Walt.

704
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,639
What am I missing here?

705
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,639
You think the female of the species
has some sort of psychic insight

706
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,039
when it comes to
others of her kind?

707
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,571
We don't.

708
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,762
You're gonna get an ulcer
with all that unriddling.

709
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,048
Give it up.

710
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,682
That woman.

711
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,439
Good afternoon, ma'am.
What can I fix you?

712
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,961
A pot of tea, if you please.

713
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,726
Sure thing.

714
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,966
Ma'am.

715
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,805
Tea is balm for the soul,
don't you agree?

716
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,359
Catch the chook!

717
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,766
Grab her!

718
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,279
Girls, will you please just stop?

719
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,849
It's okay, it's okay.
I know, I know.

720
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,046
In you go.

721
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,639
All right?

722
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,851
It's okay.

723
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,679
Ahoy, Goffs! Ahoy!

724
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,279
Father!

725
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,159
Whoa! That's better.

726
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,679
What a wonderful surprise.

727
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,211
Did you finish early?

728
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,359
No, I couldn't stop thinking
of my beautiful girls

729
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,479
on this beautiful day
in this beautiful place.

730
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,959
And I thought, "To hell with it."

731
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,519
But don't you have work to do?

732
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,119
"But, but, but."

733
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,679
Butts are for goats, my love.

734
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,246
I'll put in extra hours tomorrow.

735
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,199
A gift of a pear for milady.

736
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,841
Thank you.

737
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,799
Now, what are we playing?

738
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,639
The hen got out and we've
been trying to catch her.

739
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,921
Ah.

740
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,248
That's no hen.

741
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,767
That's Aunt Ellie, your
mother's horrendiferous sister!

742
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,319
That's a made-up word.

743
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,567
Yes, it is.

744
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,759
Hurry, catch her before
she flies away on the...

745
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,007
West wind!

746
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,566
West wind.

747
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,679
- Quick, get Aunt Ellie!
- Ellie!

748
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,881
Come on, Biddy!

749
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,086
That way.

750
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,759
Oh, she's a foul fowl!

751
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,962
Get Aunt Ellie!

752
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,566
Come on.

753
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,290
Grab her!

754
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,127
Hurry, Sergeant Ginty!
Fell the beast!

755
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,959
Darling, it's just that
I'm a little scared.

756
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,290
Meg, sweet,
I had a throat scratch.

757
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,571
But the bank is getting
you down again.

758
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,559
Perhaps my sister can help.

759
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,081
No. God, no.

760
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,001
I can endure. I will endure.

761
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,844
For the girls. Just, please...

762
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,479
Oh, God, not Ellie.

763
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,001
She's a foul fowl.

764
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,599
It's gotta be like a slogan.

765
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,131
Her prescription for life.

766
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,279
"An apple a day?'

767
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,359
"A stitch in time."

768
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,881
"Time and tide wait for no man."

769
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,001
Sugar.

770
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,799
"Sugar" Yeah?

771
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,159
Jeff had vaccination day
at school yesterday.

772
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,319
- Ouch.
- No ouch.

773
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,885
- No ouch?
- Sugar.

774
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,319
They put it in a cube.

775
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,799
Medicine in sugar?

776
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,809
"Cube" is an odd word.

777
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,881
"Spoonful."

778
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,882
You need sugar? We have sugar.

779
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,199
Well, morning!
May I walk with you?

780
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,999
I'm sure there aren't any laws
in your country against it.

781
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,439
<i>A robin feathering his nest</i>

782
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,927
<i>Has very little time to rest</i>

783
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,406
Go back to the chorus.

784
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,359
<i>For a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down</i>

785
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,891
<i>The medicine...</i>

786
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,888
It's not... It's missing...

787
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,561
Wait.

788
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,679
She always does the unexpected.

789
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,799
Mmm-hmm.

790
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,684
She goes up the banisters.

791
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,406
Go up!

792
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,199
<i>Just a spoonful of sugar</i>

793
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,839
<i>Helps the medicine go down</i>

794
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,519
That's it, that's it, that's it.

795
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,839
Man is in the forest.

796
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,199
I want you to play that for him.

797
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,449
Walt, hold on.
I want you to hear this.

798
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,439
- It's just the chorus.
- Tell us what you think.

799
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,879
He knows

800
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:54,559
<i>For a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down</i>

801
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,759
<i>The medicine go down
The medicine go down</i>

802
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,959
<i>Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down</i>

803
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,359
We'll... We'll work out
the rest of the lyrics.

804
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,559
You see how it goes up
on the word "down"?

805
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,759
On the word "down," it goes up.

806
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,799
It's ironic.

807
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,199
Oh, forget "ironic."
It's iconic.

808
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,399
I won't be able to stop
singing that for weeks.

809
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,919
Well, it seems enormously
patronizing to me.

810
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,439
Just the sort of annoying tune
you'd have playing

811
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,919
in your themed park, I daresay.

812
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,799
All giddy and carefree, encouraging
children to face the world unarmed.

813
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,919
All they need is a
spoon and some sugar

814
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,799
and a brain full of fluff and
they're equipped with life's tools.

815
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,001
Wonderful.

816
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,759
What's your point, Pam?

817
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,759
"Mrs. Travers," please.

818
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,639
My point is that, unlike yourself,

819
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,810
Mary Poppins is the very enemy
of whimsy and sentiment.

820
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,159
She's truthful.

821
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,279
She doesn't sugarcoat
the darkness in the world

822
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,799
that these children will eventually,
inevitably come to know.

823
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,279
She prepares them for it.
She deals in honesty.

824
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,799
One must clean one's room.

825
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,759
It won't magically do it by itself.

826
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,439
This entire script is flim-flam. Hmm?

827
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,479
Where is its heart?
Where is its reality?

828
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,002
Where is the gravitas?

829
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,369
No weight, Mr. Disney.

830
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,801
See?

831
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,719
"No whimsy or sentiment"
says the woman

832
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,319
who sent a flying nanny
with a talking umbrella

833
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,681
to save the children.

834
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,848
You think Mary Poppins has come
to save the children, Mr. Disney?

835
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,366
Oh, dear.

836
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,519
Mr. Belhatchett.

837
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,767
Good afternoon.

838
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,045
After you, my dear.

839
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,244
Allow me.

840
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,239
or if I'm five minutes late

841
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,519
opening his stupid bank!

842
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,639
Well, then, he'll take to me

843
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,879
with the business end
of his beautiful hatchet!

844
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,359
There! Whack!

845
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,881
"Take that for not dropping
your bairns on schedule!"

846
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,199
Whack! "Go on, then!
Take that! Take that!"

847
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,719
- Mr. Belhatchett...
- I want you gone.

848
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,090
Ginty.

849
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,091
Sweet thing,
what are you doing here?

850
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,239
You said today was ice cream day.

851
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,081
Ice cream day. Yes, I did.

852
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,885
Of course, of course.

853
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,290
What kind of a father am I?
Come here.

854
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,003
Are you fired again?

855
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,759
Yes.
It does seem that...

856
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,442
No, sweetheart. No.

857
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,251
He's not.

858
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,331
Darling, wait inside for a second.

859
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,079
Mr. Belhatchett...

860
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,090
If you can't straighten up
for your own sake,

861
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,279
do it for your daughter.

862
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,925
Irresponsible.

863
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,690
We share a Celtic soul, you and I.

864
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,689
This world,

865
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,881
it's just an illusion,
Ginty old girl.

866
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,919
As long as we hold
that thought dear,

867
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,724
they can't break us.

868
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,363
They can't make us
endure their reality.

869
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,807
Bleak and bloody as it is.

870
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,886
Money. Money, money.

871
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,640
Don't you buy into it, Ginty.

872
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,724
It'll bite you on the bottom.

873
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,251
I loathe this place, Mr. Russell.

874
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,479
It's bringing up these...

875
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,251
Well, it's so hot and stuffy.

876
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,282
I feel as if I'm being attacked.

877
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,719
There's these odd dreams,

878
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,239
as if my subconscious
were after me,

879
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,879
punishing me for
entertaining the idea

880
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,402
that I might hand her over.

881
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,604
I'm at war with myself,
Mr. Russell.

882
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,642
The script is ghastly.

883
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,403
Empty pap, just as I expected.

884
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,051
Yes. A few more days,
then I'll decide.

885
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,121
Oh.

886
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,804
Serves me right.

887
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:01,807
Money, money, money.
It bit me on the butt.

888
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:34,848
<i>Feed the birds,
tuppence a bag</i>

889
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:42,119
<i>Tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag</i>

890
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:48,407
<i>Feed the birds
That's what she cries</i>

891
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:54,799
<i>While overhead,
her birds fill the skies</i>

892
00:53:54,800 --> 00:54:01,359
<i>All around the cathedral
the saints and apostles</i>

893
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:06,168
<i>Look down as she sells her wares</i>

894
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:13,199
<i>Although you can't see it
You know they are smiling</i>

895
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:20,363
<i>Each time someone

896
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:27,569
<i>Though her words are simple and few</i>

897
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:34,764
<i>Listen, listen
She's calling to you</i>

898
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:41,930
<i>Feed the birds, tuppence a bag</i>

899
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,882
<i>Tuppence</i>

900
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,243
<i>Tuppence</i>

901
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,401
<i>Tuppence a bag</i>

902
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,409
That'll work.

903
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,805
But she's gonna say no, isn't she?

904
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,247
The woman is a conundrum.

905
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,771
<i>My world was calm</i>

906
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,599
<i>Well ordered, exemplary</i>

907
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,079
"Exemplary."

908
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:38,959
<i>Then came this person
with chaos in her wake</i>

909
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:47,079
<i>And now my life's ambitions go</i>

910
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:51,444
<i>With one fell blow</i>

911
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:58,485
<i>It's quite a bitter pill to take</i>

912
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,370
Inspired by someone we know?

913
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,649
You'd have to ask Bob.

914
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,559
She might surprise us all.

915
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,599
No, no, no, she won't.

916
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,199
You don't know that.

917
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,890
No, I do. I do know it.

918
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,602
I know it only too well.

919
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,959
I fought this battle from her side.

920
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,003
Pat Powers.

921
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:26,119
Oh, he wanted the mouse, and I didn't
have a bean in my pocket back then.

922
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,119
He was this big, terrifying
New York producer,

923
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,563
I was just a kid from Missouri
with a sketch of Mickey.

924
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,319
It would've killed
me to give him up.

925
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,966
Honest to God, would've killed me.

926
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,330
That mouse is family.

927
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,645
Go home.

928
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,888
This world,

929
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,330
<i>it's just an illusion, Ginty old girl.</i>

930
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:32,248
Ah, the Countess Mary Sparklestick.

931
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,359
Pray tell me, what are you
concentrating so hard on?

932
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,879
I'm laying eggs.

933
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,559
Really? Fabulous.

934
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,879
Today, I'm a hen.

935
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,481
Indeed.

936
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,405
I can see the feathers
sprouting as we speak.

937
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,559
Helen Goff, will you lay
the table for supper, please?

938
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,639
I'm not Helen.

939
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,570
She can't possibly lay the
table, she's busy laying eggs.

940
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,279
Helen, will you lay the table
for supper, please?

941
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,481
She's laying!

942
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,999
Sorry.

943
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,959
I should...

944
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,491
Ginty.

945
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,604
Don't you ever stop dreaming,
Ginty, my love.

946
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,639
You can be anyone you want to be.

947
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,759
Anyone.

948
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,281
I want to be just like you.

949
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,241
Don't.

950
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,691
Don't.

951
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,763

953
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,051
Mrs. Travers.

954
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,759
We were saying we'd like to
play you the song in the bank.

955
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,919
Would that be good?

956
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,121
Mmm.

957
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,881

He is, indeed.
On behalf of the bank.

973
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,559
Maybe he'll pin one on me
for the maypole.

974
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,125
He might.

975
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,005
Where is Father?

976
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,330
I think he's practicing
his speech somewhere.

977
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,919

978
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,959

Why is he speaking for the bank?

987
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,519
He is the manager, sir.

988
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,719

Shortly, it will, uh...

996
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,159
it will be my very pleasant duty

But, we, uh... But before I begin,

our very youngest citizens

1000
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,399
about the, uh... About the, uh,

1001
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,719

But right now,

1044
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,851
I need to relieve myself.

1045
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,084
Give us your shoulder,
Ginty, will you?

1046
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,086

make letters for you?

Do they make you drawings?

1064
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,319

01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,240
I don't suppose you can
give me any more for the pain?

1075
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,679
When will enough be enough,
Travers?

1076
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:39,927
Hmm?

1077
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:50,201
I brought you something,
Father.

1078
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,881
Be a darling, Ginty, my old pal.

1079
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:57,000
Come here.

1080
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,525
Come here. Come close.

1081
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,480
I'm sick.

1082
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,650
You'll help Father out,
won't you?

1083
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:12,171
In my washroom,

1084
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,959
there's a bottle of medicine
that Father needs.

1085
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,479
Mother took it away.

1086
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,879
Oh, God damn it!

1087
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,566
I wrote you a poem, Father.

1088
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:29,569
It won first place at school.

1089
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,126
Shall I read it to you, Father?

1090
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:01,047
It's hardly Yeats, is it?

1091
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,451
Mrs.?

1092
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,649
I, uh... I brought you a tea.

1093
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,770
It's blasphemy to drink tea
from a paper cup.

1094
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:30,759
Oh. Uh...

1095
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,086
Here.

1096
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,610
Is everything okay, Mrs.?

1097
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:42,043
Would you like me
to drive you home?

1098
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,681
All the way to England?
Yes, please.

1099
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,319
You, uh... You got family
back there, Mrs.?

1100
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,759
You're an impertinent man,
you know?

1101
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:54,119
You ask an awful lot of questions
that have absolutely no relevance

1102
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,279
to your being able
to carry out your duties.

1103
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,239
I know. Yeah, I do, do that, yes.

1104
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,727
And you have no barometer.

1105
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,919
Let's just say I haven't family

1106
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,519
who would notice whether
I were halfway across the world

1107
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,963
or sitting in my living room.

1108
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:18,479
Make a furrow. There.

1109
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,205
That's a good stick for digging.

1110
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,324
- A furrow?
- Yes.

1111
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,800
All right.

1112
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,485
I got a kid.

1113
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,004
Most people do.

1114
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,811
Jane.

1115
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:38,681
Yeah.

1116
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,045
What a terrific kid.

1117
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:45,399
Beautiful little girl.

1118
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:48,599
She's got a lot of problems,
though.

1119
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,087
She's handicapped, you know?

1120
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,524
She's in a wheelchair.

1121
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:00,730
See, and that's why I concern
myself with the weather so much.

1122
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:04,841
Sunny day, she can sit outside
in the garden.

1123
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:09,802
Rainy day, I gotta leave her
cooped up inside.

1124
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,328
I worry about the future,

1125
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,643
but you can't do that.

1126
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:21,366
Only today.

1127
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:23,881
Mmm.

1128
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,565
Yeah.

1129
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,486
Now, look.

1130
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,926
It's a bandstand.

1131
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,525
Ah!

1132
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,319
Ah! A river!

1133
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,284
- Lake.
- Lake.

1134
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,201
Hmm.

1135
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:43,563
Hey, hey, hey, I sure would
like to take her there.

1136
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,729
Wouldn't that be nice?

1137
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,726
Mother?

1138
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,041
I know you gave it to him.

1139
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,889
Take care of your sisters.

1140
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:14,921
What?

1141
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,609
I know you love your father more.

1142
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:25,450
But one day, you will understand.

1143
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:33,766
Hmm.

1144
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,051
Mother!

1145
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,201
Mother?

1146
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,450
Mother!

1147
01:13:58,720 --> 01:13:59,999
Mother!

1148
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,764
Come on, Albert.

1149
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,521
Mother!

1150
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,481
Please!

1151
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,361
Mother!

1152
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,001
Mother!

1153
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,041
Mother!

1154
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,488
It's time to go home.

1155
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,409
I'm sorry.

1156
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,079
Oh, my God.

1157
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,089
I'm sorry.

1158
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,566
Yes, that will be very good.

1159
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:48,928
Let's have that.

1160
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,839
I think we should
go with Frida Kahlo.

1161
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,968
Mrs. Travers. Yes?

1162
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,685
Pam. Walt.

1163
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,599
Mr. Disney.

1164
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,919
I'm calling to, uh...
Well, to check up on you.

1165
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,599
<i>I understand things
didn't go so well today.</i>

1166
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,679
<i>Something about Mr. Banks?</i>

1167
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:18,359
They went as well as they've gone on
every other day that I've been here.

1168
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:21,599
I don't recall any special phone calls
from you on any of those other evenings.

1169
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,847
<i>Pam,</i>

1170
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,719
what's this all about?

1171
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:26,921
I mean, really?

1172
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:30,486
I'm wondering what I have
to do to make you happy.

1173
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,119
Oh.

1174
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:35,369
<i>And you're wondering that,
too, aren't you?</i>

1175
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:39,719
You know, you've never
been to Disneyland,

1176
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,684
<i>and that's the happiest place on earth.</i>

1177
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,159
Tommie!
Cancel my morning tomorrow.

1178
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,679
I'm gonna take a ride
with my favorite author.

1179
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,599
No, no, no, please, Mr. Disney,

1180
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,839
I cannot begin to tell you how
uninterested, no, positively sickened I am

1181
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,319
at the thought of visiting
your dollar-printing machine.

1182
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,959
Well, for crying out loud,

1183
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,559
when does anybody
get to go to Disneyland

1184
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,359
with Walt Disney himself?

1185
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,359
Disappointments are to the soul

1186
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,562
what the thunderstorm
is to the air.

1187
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,210
Hello?

1188
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:13,439
He...

1189
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,244
He hung up. He hung up.

1190
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,329
Guys, we gotta fix this.

1191
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:40,201
Father, wind's from the east.

1192
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,125
The aunt.

1193
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,289
Oh, dear.

1194
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,931
Now...

1195
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:25,002
I've brought every newfangled
treatment available in Sydney.

1196
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,680
Close your mouth, Biddy.
We are not a codfish.

1197
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:39,801
Hmm.

1198
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:46,966
Now, I see a multitude of jobs
that need to be done.

1199
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:49,999
I've just been, um...
I've been so worried.

1200
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,089
Oh, stop your babbling nonsense.

1201
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:56,085
I'm here now,
and I shall fix everything.

1202
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,969
I thought I made it perfectly clear
that you two ought to start helping.

1203
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,121
Hmm?

1204
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,721
Spit-spot!

1205
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:09,879
Where are we?

1206
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,199
This isn't the way.

1207
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,687
Change of venue this morning,
apparently.

1208
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:15,441
Oh...

1209
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,285
Wow!

1210
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,291
There he is!

1211
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,439
Living and breathing.

1212
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,609
Oh, boy!

1213
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,450
Oh, I can get that.

1214
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:01,482
Mrs. Travers, welcome
to the Magic Kingdom.

1215
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:07,999
Is it all like this?

1216
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,247
Yep.

1217
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,679
Isn't it wonderful?

1218
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:11,719
Hey.

1219
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,888
Do you always get
everything you want, Walter?

1220
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:15,759
Pretty much.

1221
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,359
With the exception of the
rights to my books, of course.

1222
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,919
Well, the war ain't over yet, Pam.

1223
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,679
The war ain't over yet.

1224
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:23,719
I love you so much.

1225
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:25,279
Oh, ho!

1226
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:28,006
Sure, sure. Here you go.

1227
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,639
Here you go.

1228
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:31,759
Pre-signed?

1229
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:32,959
Hey, you should get hers, too.

1230
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,845
This woman is a bona fide genius.

1231
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,806
The tour starts this way, Pam.

1232
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,004
Hot dog.

1233
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:44,919
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1234
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:47,319
Move along, move along.
Up, up, up, up!

1235
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,284
That's good. That's good.

1236
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,279
Each section of the
park has a high point

1237
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,319
so you can get your bearings.

1238
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,999
In Adventureland, there's a tree.

1239
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,362
This is a fun fact,
this is a titbit.

1240
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,639
"Tidbit."

1241
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:07,999
It's got three million leaves,
four million flowers.

1242
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,567
- Gosh.
- They said only God could make a tree.

1243
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,768
Mr. Disney, sir,
would you mind signing this?

1244
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:18,359
No. Do you one better.
Here you go, have a great day.

1245
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,050
Oh. Thank you so much.

1246
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,209
- Mr. Disney!
- Hey.

1247
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:32,288
Where did she come from?

1248
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,359
Who?

1249
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,005
Oh, I think you know.

1250
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:39,529
She flew in through the
window one day.

1251
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:41,919
"Flew in through the window."

1252
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:45,408
It was just that easy,
was it, Mrs. Travers?

1253
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:49,159
Do you see those spires?

1254
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,399
Plated with 24-karat gold.

1255
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:52,479
Roy was against it,

1256
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,719
so I waited until he was
out of town to get it done.

1257
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:56,251
How clever.

1258
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,879
Now, I know
you don't want to be here,

1259
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:00,479
so, I'm just gonna
take you to one ride.

1260
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:03,039
My favorite amusement,
and then I'll set you free.

1261
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,279
Hello, Mr. Disney!

1262
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:07,239
Hello, folks, how are you?
Enjoy the day.

1263
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:08,399
Hey, kids.

1264
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,211
Ernie.

1265
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:12,999
- Welcome. Right this way.
- Thank you so much.

1266
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,399
Excuse me, please.

1267
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,999
Mrs. Travers, I would be honored if you
would take a ride on Jingles, here.

1268
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,964
This is Mrs. Disney's
favorite horse.

1269
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:24,405
No, thank you.
I'm happy to watch.

1270
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,319
Now, there's no
greater joy than that

1271
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,879
seen through the eyes of a child,

1272
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:30,319
and there's a little bit
of a child in all of us.

1273
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:33,649
Maybe in you, Mr. Disney,
but certainly not in me.

1274
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:35,766
Get on the horse, Pamela.

1275
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,919
Now, when we first met,

1276
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:47,566
you said to me, "They're family."

1277
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:49,199
I said what?

1278
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:52,370
Mary Poppins, the Banks.
They're family.

1279
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,479
The boys have come up with
an idea for your Mr. Banks.

1280
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:56,879
I think it's gonna make you happy.

1281
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,479
You didn't bring me all the
way out here to tell me that?

1282
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:00,639
Oh, no, no, no.

1283
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,127
I brought you all the way out
here for monetary gain.

1284
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:06,319
I had a wager with the boys.
Couldn't get you on a ride.

1285
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,439
I just won 20 bucks.

1286
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,447
I see you. I see you.

1287
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:05,848
Well begun is half done.

1288
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,730
There you go.

1289
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,964
Give it a whack, Biddy.
Nice and hard.

1290
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,285
Morning, Mrs. Travers.

1291
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,199
What horrors have you in store

1292
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,767
for my beautiful characters today?

1293
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,088
You sit here.

1294
01:24:58,360 --> 01:24:59,846
All right.

1295
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,244
What are you up to?

1296
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:08,599
We were thinking
about what you said,

1297
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,768
and you're right.

1298
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:15,563
Mr. Banks isn't cruel. He isn't.

1299
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:20,650
So, we have a new
end for the film.

1300
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:23,442
Oh, God, I hope you like it.

1301
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:42,879
Michael says,
"He mended it. It's wonderful."

1302
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,367
"However did you manage it?"

1303
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:46,639
He mended the kite?

1304
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:55,251
<i>With tuppence
for paper and strings</i>

1305
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:59,203
<i>You can have your own set of wings</i>

1306
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:03,199
<i>With your feet on the ground
You're a bird in flight</i>

1307
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,879
<i>With your fist holding tight</i>

1308
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:08,719
<i>To the string of your kite</i>

1309
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,999
<i>Oh, oh, oh!</i>

1310
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,599
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

1311
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:18,119
<i>Up to the highest height</i>

1312
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:21,559
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

1313
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:25,399
<i>And send it soaring</i>

1314
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:28,919
<i>Up through the atmosphere</i>

1315
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:32,679
<i>Up where the air is clear</i>

1316
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:37,879
<i>Oh, let's go fly a kite</i>

1317
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:41,639
Then, Mrs. Banks
runs through her house.

1318
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:44,719
She gets the suffragette ribbon,
and says...

1319
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:46,999
"A proper kite deserves
a proper tail,

1320
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,199
"don't you think?"

1321
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,839
<i>Oh, oh, oh!</i>

1322
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:54,319
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

1323
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:57,879
<i>Up to the highest height</i>

1324
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:01,319
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

1325
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:05,159
<i>And send it soaring</i>

1326
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:09,039
<i>Up through the atmosphere</i>

1327
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:12,439
<i>Up where the air is clear</i>

1328
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:17,680
<i>Oh, let's go fly a kite</i>

1329
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:22,959
<i>When you send it flying up there</i>

1330
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:26,519
<i>All at once
You're lighter than air</i>

1331
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:28,399
<i>You can dance on the breeze</i>

1332
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,359
<i>Over houses and trees</i>

1333
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:32,799
<i>With your fist holding tight</i>

1334
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,082
<i>To the string of your kite</i>

1335
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,330
Mr. Disney! Walt!

1336
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,639
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1337
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:43,759
It's just that she's dancing.

1338
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,044
Mrs. Travers.
She's dancing with Don.

1339
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,879
<i>Oh, oh, oh!</i>

1340
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:54,599
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

1341
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:58,039
<i>Up to the highest height</i>

1342
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:01,399
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

1343
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:05,199
<i>And send it soaring</i>

1344
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:08,839
<i>Up through the atmosphere</i>

1345
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:12,479
<i>Up where the air is clear</i>

1346
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:19,165
<i>Oh, let's go fly a kite</i>

1347
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:23,959
He... He fixes the kite.

1348
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:25,079
Oh, I love it.

1349
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:31,287
Although, the proper English would
be, "Let us go and fly a kite."

1350
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:34,604
<i>Let us go and fly a kite</i>

1351
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:37,488
I might be willing
to overlook that.

1352
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,565
All right.

1353
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:40,921
Very good.

1354
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,366
Look at you.

1355
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:58,811
I rewrote the poem, Father.

1356
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,603
The aunt gave me tuppence.

1357
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,531
Shall I buy you something, Father?

1358
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,450
Pears.

1359
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:30,165
Pears.

1360
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,250
Father.

1361
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:37,609
Tuppence for pears,
pears, pears, pears.

1362
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:40,731
Tuppence for pears,
pears, pears, pears.

1363
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:54,199
You're quite right, you know?
It is beautiful.

1364
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,731
Exquisite.

1365
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,051
It's always new.

1366
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:08,719
So, <i>Jolly Holiday</i> is in?

1367
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:09,839
Mmm. By all means.

1368
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:10,959
Wonderful.

1369
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:12,879
I do have a question
about it, actually.

1370
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:17,560
How in the world does Mr. Disney propose
to train all the penguins to dance?

1371
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:20,799
I've heard about his
implausibly-leaved trees.

1372
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,679
So, I presume he does have some
insane penguin-wrangling scheme.

1373
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:25,928
But it does seem a little
far-fetched, even for him.

1374
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:29,289
Can you train a penguin to dance?

1375
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:33,439
No, I don't think you can train...

1376
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:35,324
- They're animated.
- Dick...

1377
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,439
- They're what?
- Cartoons.

1378
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:40,846
Dick!

1379
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:46,681
What?

1380
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:53,844
Are we getting real penguins?

1381
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,882
Yes, 2:00, Tuesday.

1382
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,079
Good afternoon, Mrs. Travers.

1383
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:00,239
I'm here to see Mr. Disney.

1384
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:01,399
Oh, please, have a...

1385
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:02,679
Mrs. Travers, please!

1386
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:03,839
Disney!

1387
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,850
Mrs. Travers?

1388
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,446
Mrs. Travers!

1389
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:12,999
I'm terribly sorry, Walt.

1390
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,441
It's all right, Tommie.
Just close the door.

1391
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,839
I never let anyone see me smoking.

1392
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,399
I hate to encourage bad habits.

1393
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,839
Please, sit down.

1394
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:25,439
I shall not sit in the seat of a
trickster, a fraudster, a sneak!

1395
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:26,519
Pamela!

1396
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,484
"Mrs. Travers," please!

1397
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:31,724
Mrs. Travers,
what has you so upset now?

1398
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,879
Penguins.

1399
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:36,839
Penguins have very much
upset me, Mr. Disney.

1400
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:38,719
Animated dancing penguins.

1401
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:40,639
Now, you have...
You have seduced me

1402
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:42,039
with the music, Mr. Disney.
Yes, you have.

1403
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:44,239
Those Sherman boys have
quite turned my head.

1404
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:48,599
But I shall not be moved upon
the matter of cartoons, sir.

1405
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:51,167
Not one inch!

1406
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:53,119
It is a sequence.

1407
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,239
You promised me.

1408
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:57,919
You promised me that this film
would not be an animation!

1409
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,804
And it isn't.

1410
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,845
So, they're real penguins?

1411
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:06,641
No. No, they are animated.

1412
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:10,719
But the actors, you see, the
actors are very, very much real.

1413
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,729
Foolish old woman.

1414
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:16,846
Have a good day, Mr. Disney.

1415
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,206
Pamela.

1416
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,081
Pam!

1417
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:34,599
Oh, Dolly, would you be so kind as to ring
my driver, and ask him to collect me?

1418
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:35,801
Yes, ma'am.

1419
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:37,971
Thank you.

1420
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:52,769
Here we are, Mrs.

1421
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:54,850
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1422
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:07,886
It's been a real pleasure
driving you, Mrs.

1423
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:10,559
No one likes a fibber.

1424
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:11,761
Oh, no, no.

1425
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:14,927
I really have enjoyed it.

1426
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:19,439
I didn't know who
you were at first.

1427
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:20,846
And then, guess what.

1428
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:22,599
You found out?

1429
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:25,679
I was telling my daughter
all about my day,

1430
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:28,559
and how I'm driving this nice
writer lady, Mrs. Travers,

1431
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:31,570
for Mr. Disney, and, uh...

1432
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,361
And?

1433
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:36,731
And...

1434
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:41,839
And she made me go to her bedroom,

1435
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,327
and bring her this.

1436
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,204
I can't stop reading it,
you know.

1437
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:50,770
I'm very slow, mind you, so...

1438
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:53,249
Would you like me to sign it?

1439
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:54,679
Would you?

1440
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:56,245
I'd be honored.

1441
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,761
Uh...

1442
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:07,279
Let me see, now.

1443
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,960
"To Jane

1444
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,766
"and her dearest father..."

1445
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:17,759
I've just this instant realized

1446
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:19,246
I don't know your name.

1447
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:21,161
Ralph.

1448
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:24,207
Pamela.

1449
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:31,119
You're the only American
I've ever liked, Ralph.

1450
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,448
Oh... Well, may I ask why?

1451
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,039
No.

1452
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:38,244
Now, take this.

1453
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:42,720
"Albert Einstein,
Van Gogh, Roosevelt.

1454
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,639
"Frida Kahlo."

1455
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:46,171
- "Kahlo."
- Kahlo.

1456
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:48,319
What is this?

1457
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,090
They all had difficulties.

1458
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:54,560
Jane can do anything
that anyone else can do.

1459
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,524
Do you understand?

1460
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,121
Oh.

1461
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,648
I almost forgot, turn it around.

1462
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:07,361
"Walt Disney."

1463
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:10,599
Hyperactive behavior
and deficiencies in concentration.

1464
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:13,007
It explains everything.

1465
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,888
Thank you, Mrs.

1466
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:25,999
She acted like an angry
person a lot of the time.

1467
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,119
Mmm-hmm.

1468
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:29,319
So, she's come and gone, huh?

1469
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:32,159
Yeah, her flight
left 10 minutes ago.

1470
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:35,319
Beverly Hills Hotel,
private limousine.

1471
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:38,330
First-class plane ticket
back to England for...

1472
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,888
Wait. "Goff"?

1473
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,639
Who is... Who is Helen Goff?

1474
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:45,559
That's her. That's her real name.

1475
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:47,519
She acts so hoity-toity British,

1476
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,563
and she's really an Aussie.

1477
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:52,402
Then who is Travers?

1478
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,571
I've been talking to
the wrong person?

1479
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:19,926
He's gone.

1480
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:26,687
No, no, no. You mustn't.

1481
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:29,851
Let her go, Margaret.

1482
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:10,082
I dropped the pears.

1483
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:14,000
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1484
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:22,039
Helen, dear girl...

1485
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:25,210
You promised you
would fix everything.

1486
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:03,850
Hello, house.

1487
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:40,200
Oh, dear God!

1488
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:43,239
It was one heck of a
job getting a seat

1489
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:46,011
on the very next flight,
let me tell you.

1490
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,799
Mrs. Travers,

1491
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,561
I could sure use a nice
pot of English tea about now.

1492
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,205
Here we are.

1493
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:07,165
Allow me.

1494
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:10,519
Milk in first, remember?

1495
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,722
Yeah, I remember.

1496
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:16,839
And a spoonful of sugar?

1497
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:18,485
NO, I think I'll have whisky.

1498
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:20,521
Oh.

1499
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:23,480
Ooh.

1500
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,611
That's okay.

1501
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:30,320
Well, when in Rome...

1502
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:37,961
Thank you.

1503
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:40,839
You've come to change my mind,
haven't you?

1504
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:43,279
To beat me into submission.

1505
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:44,679
No. No.

1506
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:49,169
I've come because you misjudged me.

1507
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,359
How do I misjudge you?

1508
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:55,839
You look at me

1509
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:59,159
and you see some kind
of Hollywood King Midas.

1510
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:02,039
You think I've built an empire,
and I want your Mary Poppins

1511
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:04,919
as just another brick
in my kingdom.

1512
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:06,963
And don't you?

1513
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,839
Now, if that was all it was,

1514
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:12,119
would I have suckered up
to a cranky, stubborn dame

1515
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:14,399
like you for 20 years?

1516
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,841
No, I would have
saved myself an ulcer.

1517
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:19,130
No... You, uh...

1518
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:21,479
You expected me to disappoint you,

1519
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:23,205
and so you made sure I did.

1520
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:28,723
Well, I think life disappoints you,
Mrs. Travers.

1521
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:32,519
I think it's done that a lot, and I
think Mary Poppins is the only person

1522
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,165
in your life who hasn't.

1523
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:38,319
Mary Poppins isn't real.

1524
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:39,959
That's not true. No, no, no.

1525
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:42,959
She's as real as can
be to my daughters.

1526
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:45,288
And to thousands
of other kids. Adults, too.

1527
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:49,843
She's been there as a nighttime
comfort to a heck of a lot of people.

1528
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:53,519
Well, where is she
when I need her, hmm?

1529
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,039
I open the door to Mary Poppins,

1530
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:59,450
and who should be standing there,
but Walt Disney?

1531
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:03,849
Mrs. Travers, I'm sorry.

1532
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:08,159
I'd hoped this would have been
a magical experience,

1533
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:11,719
for you and for all of us,
but I've let you down.

1534
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:12,999
And, in doing so,

1535
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,211
I've broken a 20-year-old
promise I made to my daughters.

1536
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:20,519
I've been racking my brain,
trying to figure out why

1537
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:23,883
this has been so
hard for you and I.

1538
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,009
And, well...

1539
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:34,447
You see,
I have my own Mr. Banks.

1540
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,039
Mine had a mustache.

1541
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:42,404
So, it is not true that Disney
created man in his own image?

1542
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,799
No, no.

1543
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:47,279
But it is true that
you created yourself

1544
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:49,130
in someone else's, yes?

1545
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,679
Have you ever been
to Kansas City, Mrs. Travers?

1546
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:55,405
Do you know Missouri at all?

1547
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:57,639
I can't say I do.

1548
01:41:57,640 --> 01:41:59,879
Well, it's mighty cold
there in the winters.

1549
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:01,519
Bitter cold.

1550
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,559
And my dad, Elias Disney,

1551
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,759
he owned a newspaper
delivery route there.

1552
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:08,119
A thousand papers, twice daily.

1553
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:10,607
A morning and an evening edition.

1554
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:12,959
And Dad was a tough businessman.

1555
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:16,639
He was a "save a penny
any way you can" type of fella.

1556
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:19,759
So he wouldn't employ
delivery boys.

1557
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:24,090
No, no, no. He used me
and my big brother Roy.

1558
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:28,119
I was, uh...
I was eight back then.

1559
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:29,765
Just eight years old.

1560
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:34,002
And, like I said,
winters are harsh.

1561
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:36,759
And old Elias, well,
he didn't believe in new shoes,

1562
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:39,439
until the old ones
were worn through.

1563
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,959
Honestly, Mrs. Travers,

1564
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,559
the snowdrifts, sometimes they
were up over my head.

1565
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:46,570
And we'd push through that
snow like it was molasses.

1566
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,719
The cold and wet seeping through

1567
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:52,127
our clothes and our shoes.

1568
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:55,159
Skin peeling from our faces.

1569
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:58,879
Sometimes I'd find myself
sunk down in that snow,

1570
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,079
just waking up,

1571
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,567
because I must have passed out
or something, I don't know.

1572
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:05,439
And then it was time for school,

1573
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:07,079
and I was too cold or wet

1574
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:10,039
to figure out equations and things.

1575
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:11,999
And then it was right back
out in the snow again

1576
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,804
to get home just before dark.

1577
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:17,479
Mother would feed us dinner.

1578
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:19,599
And then it was time
to go right back out

1579
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,531
and do it again for
the evening edition.

1580
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:28,599
"You had best be quick there, Walt."
"You'd better get those newspapers up

1581
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:31,119
"on that porch
and under that storm door.

1582
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:33,039
"Poppa's gonna lose
his temper again

1583
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:36,403
"and show you the buckle
end of his belt, boy."

1584
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:43,999
I don't... I don't tell you this
to make you sad,

1585
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,279
Mrs. Travers.

1586
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:47,879
I don't. I love my life.
I think it's a miracle.

1587
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:51,959
And I loved my dad. He was a...
He was a wonderful man.

1588
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:54,559
But rare is the day

1589
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:58,239
when I don't think about
that eight-year-old boy

1590
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:01,599
delivering newspapers in the snow,

1591
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:05,691
and old Elias Disney
with that strap in his fist.

1592
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:07,845
And I am just so tired.

1593
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,531
Mrs. Travers,

1594
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:15,609
I'm tired of remembering
it that way.

1595
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:19,559
Aren't you tired, too,
Mrs. Travers?

1596
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:21,439
Now we all have our sad tales,

1597
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:25,439
but don't you want
to finish the story?

1598
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:26,919
Let it all go and have a life

1599
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:30,169
that isn't dictated by the past?

1600
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:37,879
It's not the children
she comes to save.

1601
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:39,445
It's their father.

1602
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,241
It's your father.

1603
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:47,851
Travers Goff.

1604
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:56,959
I don't know what you think
you know about me, Walter...

1605
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:00,919
You must have loved and admired
him a lot to take his name.

1606
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:01,999
I...

1607
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,959
It's him this is all about,
isn't it?

1608
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:05,889
All of it, everything.

1609
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:12,279
Forgiveness, Mrs. Travers.

1610
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:14,919
It's what I learned
from your books.

1611
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:16,839
I don't have to forgive my father.

1612
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:18,399
He was a wonderful man.

1613
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:20,284
No, no.

1614
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,409
You need to forgive Helen Goff.

1615
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:28,805
Life is a harsh sentence
to lay down for yourself.

1616
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:34,319
Give her to me.

1617
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:39,367
Mrs. Travers, trust me with
your precious Mary Poppins.

1618
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:42,722
I won't disappoint you.

1619
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:46,439
I swear, every time a person
walks into a movie house,

1620
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:49,119
from Leicester Square
to Kansas City,

1621
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:52,085
they will see George
Banks being saved.

1622
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:54,919
They will love him and his kids.

1623
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:57,885
They will weep for his cares.

1624
01:45:58,120 --> 01:46:01,767
They will wring their hands
when he loses his job.

1625
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:05,806
And when he flies that kite...

1626
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:09,563
Oh, Mrs. Travers,
they will rejoice.

1627
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:12,530
They will sing.

1628
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:17,519
In movie houses all over the world, in the
eyes and hearts of my kids and other kids,

1629
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:20,371
and mothers and fathers
for generations to come,

1630
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,568
George Banks will be honored.

1631
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:27,447
George Banks will be redeemed.

1632
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:31,207
George Banks and all he stands for
will be saved.

1633
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:36,370
Now, maybe not in life,
but in imagination.

1634
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,680
Because that's what
we storytellers do.

1635
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,359
We restore order with imagination.

1636
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:46,770
We instill hope again
and again and again.

1637
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:52,439
So, trust me, Mrs. Travers.

1638
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:54,449
Let me prove it to you.

1639
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:57,841
I give you my word.

1640
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:16,051
Enough.

1641
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:40,159
Just make those two changes

1642
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:42,601
and I'm sure everything
will be just fine. Just fine.

1643
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:44,639
Walt, could I get
your approval on that, please?

1644
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:45,799
What is it?

1645
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:47,639
Invitation list to the premiere.

1646
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:49,759
Yeah? Is this everyone?

1647
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:51,689
It's not everyone.

1648
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:57,279
Now, there will be a
premiere in London.

1649
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:59,721
That will be more
convenient for her.

1650
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:04,359
Tommie, this wasn't an easy decision
for me, but you know what she's like.

1651
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:06,879
We got press,
interviews, cameras.

1652
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:10,562
I need to protect the picture.

1653
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:12,804
Okay.

1654
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:19,045
Ah.

1655
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,042
I should say so, too.

1656
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:25,243
Mrs. Travers!

1657
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:32,399
Mrs. Travers!

1658
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:35,319
Will you stop screeching
like an alley cat!

1659
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:37,602
And answer the door!

1660
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:40,399
I'm very pleased to
hear that, Pamela.

1661
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,839
I should think you will
have a draft fairly soon.

1662
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:44,359
Polly, where's that tea?

1663
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:46,079
It's coming along marvelously.

1664
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:47,239
Ah, ah, ah.

1665
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:48,851
No peeking.

1666
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:52,599
Aren't you going to pour it for us?

1667
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:55,610
You're perfectly capable
of pouring it yourself.

1668
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:00,119
She's quite the worst
maid I've ever had.

1669
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:01,679
- So why do you keep her?
- I don't know.

1670
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:03,644
She reminds me of me.

1671
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:06,641
Do you have a title?

1672
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:08,962
<i>Mary Poppins in the Kitchen.</i>

1673
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:10,446
Wonderful.

1674
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:14,561
So, should we start talking
about the film rights?

1675
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:15,879
Never again.

1676
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:17,320
Okay.

1677
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:21,566
Now, tell me, have you got
your tiara for the premiere?

1678
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:23,519
Oh, I'm not going to that.

1679
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:24,919
Why not?

1680
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:27,726
Hollywood premieres aren't
for an old trout like me.

1681
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:32,007
Anyway, it's not convenient.

1682
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:34,482
He hasn't invited you, has he?

1683
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:41,247
Mary Poppins wouldn't
stand for that.

1684
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:47,719
Can I help you?

1685
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:49,251
I'm perfectly capable, thank you.

1686
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:51,450
As I recall.

1687
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:55,245
Sweet of you.

1688
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:01,568
- Walt... Um...
- Hello, Dolly!

1689
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:02,839
Walt...

1690
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:06,761
Tommie, we're gonna have
to move that meeting with GE.

1691
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:09,481
What?

1692
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:18,639
Mrs. Travers.

1693
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:19,919
Me again!

1694
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:22,359
How wonderful to see you.

1695
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:24,403
I'm here for my premiere.

1696
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:26,719
Great!

1697
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:28,399
I didn't receive my invitation,

1698
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:31,039
but I just assumed the
American postal service

1699
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:34,084
had fallen down upon the job,
as per usual.

1700
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:37,927
I will have a replacement
sent to your hotel right away.

1701
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,679
You're very kind, Mr. Disney.

1702
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:42,281
I knew you wouldn't
have forgotten me.

1703
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:45,206
Pamela.

1704
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:48,770
How could I forget you?

1705
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,719
- Good evening.
- Oh, hello.

1706
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:57,319
Could you please order me a cab?

1707
01:50:57,320 --> 01:50:58,567
Absolutely.

1708
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,121
Ralph?

1709
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:20,399
I had a feeling a certain
friend of mine

1710
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:22,204
might be needing me tonight.

1711
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,079
Oh.

1712
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:30,204
Hey!
Wow.

1713
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:33,449
You look like a million bucks.

1714
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:35,644
Thank you.

1715
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:38,279
Let's get you to that ball.
Huh? Come on.

1716
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:39,720
Thank you, Ralph. Thank you.

1717
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:16,842
Oh, no, no, no.
I got that, brother.

1718
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:28,969
This is your night.

1719
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:33,207
None of this would be
possible without you.

1720
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:17,124
<i>And snap!</i>

1721
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:19,204
<i>The job is a game.</i>

1722
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:22,079
<i>And every task you undertake</i>

1723
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:24,439
<i>Becomes a piece of cake</i>

1724
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:29,646
<i>A lark, a spree
It's very clear to see</i>

1725
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:51,919
<i>Step in time, step in time</i>

1726
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:53,319
<i>Step in time, step in time</i>

1727
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:54,799
<i>Never need a reason
Never need a rhyme</i>

1728
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:58,368
<i>Step in time
You step in time</i>

1729
01:54:58,440 --> 01:55:01,799
<i>Sometimes, a person we love,
through no fault of his own,</i>

1730
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:04,446
<i>can't see past the end of his nose.</i>

1731
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:06,319
<i>Past the end of his nose?</i>

1732
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:09,159
<i>Well, now,
there must be some mistake.</i>

1733
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:11,522
<i>Your dad is a fine gentleman,
and he loves you.</i>

1734
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:13,159
<i>I don't think so.</i>

1735
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:15,559
<i>You should have seen
the look on his face.</i>

1736
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:18,161
<i>He doesn't like us at all.</i>

1737
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:20,839
<i>Well, now, that don't
seem likely, does it?</i>

1738
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:22,451
<i>Let's sit down.</i>

1739
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:25,599
<i>You know, begging your pardon,</i>

1740
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:28,724
<i>but the one my heart
goes out to is your father.</i>

1741
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:32,999
<i>There he is in that cold,
heartless bank, day after day.</i>

1742
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,682
<i>Hemmed in by mounds
of cold, heartless money.</i>

1743
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:39,599
<i>I don't like to see
any living thing caged up.</i>

1744
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:41,519
<i>Father in a cage?</i>

1745
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:44,599
<i>They makes cages in
all sizes and shapes, you know.</i>

1746
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:47,159
<i>Bank-shaped some of them,
carpets and all.</i>

1747
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:49,886
<i>Mary Poppins,
you won't ever leave us, will you?</i>

1748
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:53,279
<i>Whatever would we
do without you?</i>

1749
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:56,245
<i>I shall stay
until the wind changes.</i>

1750
01:56:30,680 --> 01:56:34,239
It's all right.
It's all right, Mrs. Travers.

1751
01:56:34,240 --> 01:56:37,887
Mr. Banks is going
to be all right, I promise.

1752
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:39,685
No, no. It's just...

1753
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:43,410
I can't abide cartoons.

1754
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:48,806
Mmm.

1755
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:51,239
Oh, oh, oh!

1756
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:54,879
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

1757
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:58,439
<i>Up to the highest height</i>

1758
01:56:58,440 --> 01:57:01,759
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

1759
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:05,719
<i>And send it soaring</i>

1760
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:09,079
<i>Up through the atmosphere</i>

1761
01:57:09,080 --> 01:57:12,599
<i>Up where the air is clear</i>

1762
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:16,441
<i>Oh, let's go...</i>

1763
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:41,690
Don't leave me.

1764
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:45,330
Never.

1765
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:48,163
I promise.

1766
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:50,729
I will never leave you.

1767
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:04,328
<i>Wind's in the east,</i>

1768
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:06,848
<i>mist coming in,</i>

1769
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:09,607
<i>like something is brewing,</i>

1770
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:12,521
<i>about to begin.</i>

1771
01:58:13,080 --> 01:58:15,362
<i>Can't put my finger</i>

1772
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:18,167
<i>on what lies in store,</i>

1773
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:21,359
<i>but I feel what's to happen</i>

1774
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:25,485
<i>all happened before.</i>

1775
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:48,479
<i>Now, who's reading?
And go slowly.</i>

1776
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:49,999
<i>You start and I'll take over...</i>

1777
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,679
<i>"Autumn. In the early part</i>

1778
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:54,159
<i>"of the 20th century, 1910. London.</i>

1779
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:56,319
<i>"At Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane,</i>

1780
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:57,919
<i>"the Banks household is in an uproar."</i>

1781
02:00:57,920 --> 02:00:58,999
Hold if.

1782
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,239
<i>Now, I see that Cherry Tree Lane</i>

1783
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:06,048
<i>as not too townified
on one side of the park.</i>

1784
02:01:06,360 --> 02:01:09,679
<i>And we'll get you a photograph
of 50 Smith Street,</i>

1785
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:14,439
<i>in order to see that the house
is really quite like that.</i>

1786
02:01:14,440 --> 02:01:17,119
<i>But it has more of a garden
than my house had.</i>

1787
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:19,119
<i>But it might be useful and amusing</i>

1788
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:21,322
<i>to put it in as my house.
You see?</i>

1789
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:25,039
<i>"Upstairs in the nursery,</i>

1790
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:27,119
<i>"where Mary is measuring up
the children</i>

1791
02:01:27,120 --> 02:01:29,439
<i>"with a long row of tape measure,</i>

1792
02:01:29,440 --> 02:01:32,039
<i>"Mary reads off the tape that Jane is..."</i>

1793
02:01:32,040 --> 02:01:33,119
<i>First she says,</i>

1794
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:34,719
<i>"What kind of material
have we got to work with?"</i>

1795
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,719
<i>No, no.
That, we cannot have.</i>

1796
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:38,719
<i>That would be quite un-English.</i>

1797
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:41,039
<i>Mrs. Travers, basically,
what we want to do here</i>

1798
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:43,199
<i>is use pretty much
what you have in the book.</i>

1799
02:01:43,200 --> 02:01:44,399
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

1800
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:46,959
<i>Now, I want this tape measure
to be used,</i>

1801
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:49,399
<i>because it was a tape measure
that my mother had</i>

1802
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:51,239
<i>- when she was a little girl.
Mmm-hmm.</i>

1803
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:53,602
<i>And I think
it would be very nice.</i>

1804
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:55,639
<i>"At the end of the chorus..."</i>

1805
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:56,879
<i>Read me all that, now.</i>

1806
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:58,559
<i>- We were going to.
- Read it.</i>

1807
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:00,079
<i>No, no. You read it.</i>

1808
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:02,479
<i>Do you want to bear us?</i>

1809
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:04,039
No. Go on.

1810
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:05,239
<i>This is torture!</i>

1811
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:08,639
<i>Now, go on.
"At the end of the chorus..."</i>

1812
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:10,319
<i>There ought perhaps to have</i>

1813
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:12,319
<i>been people in this countryside.</i>

1814
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:14,399
<i>Do you see?
Are you making note of it?</i>

1815
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:16,839
<i>And they would be the Pearly people.</i>

1816
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:19,239
<i>They'd be arriving
and they'd come nearer</i>

1817
02:02:19,240 --> 02:02:21,359
<i>and they'd see, "Ah. Hmm."</i>

1818
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:24,919
<i>They know they are
not grand enough to eat at this table.</i>

1819
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:26,759
<i>- Have you got this on tape?
- Yes. Oh, yes.</i>

1820
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:28,599
<i>Because
I think it's important.</i>

1821
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:32,282
<i>I'm not going to do this film
unless I'm available for it.</i>

1822
02:02:32,440 --> 02:02:34,599
<i>There are these tapes also,
you know.</i>

1823
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:36,279
<i>No, it's not enough.</i>

1824
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:39,279
<i>We, uh... We have
to feel the impact of it.</i>

1825
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:40,399
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

1826
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:42,119
<i>Well, anyway, it brings
about whatever it is,</i>

1827
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:45,119
<i>Mr. Banks, um, is able.</i>

1828
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:48,759
<i>He has a tender, good heart.
Not a change of heart.</i>

1829
02:02:48,760 --> 02:02:51,119
<i>Because he's always been sweet,</i>

1830
02:02:51,120 --> 02:02:53,926
<i>but worried with the cares of life.</i>
