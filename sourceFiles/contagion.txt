00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,674
WHO OFFICIAL:
How are we defining "contained?"

167
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,844
LEOPOLD: They're using the same protocols
established for SARS.

168
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,764
They're quarantining the complex
and screening for symptoms.

169
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,600
ORANTES: Kowloon is the most densely
populated area in the world...

170
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,643
...and Hong Kong is a harbor.

171
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:51,936
It's going to spread.

172
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,689
LEOPOLD:
Hong Kong is sending us blood samples.

173
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,442
We're also looking at samples
from London.

174
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,404
Two clusters: One at a hotel,
the other at a health club.

175
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,532
Five dead, encephalitis.

176
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,787
And there's the man on the bus in Tokyo.

177
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:13,082
- Three dead in that cluster.
- Any of them travel to China or London?

178
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,335
We're checking.

179
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:21,049
PARAMEDIC:
Mr. Neal, I want you to stay with me here.

180
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:25,720
Can you hear me?
Have you had seizures before? Mr. Neal?

181
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,890
- I want you to open your eyes if you can.
MRS. NEAL: He's breathing, right?

182
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,435
[SOBBING] I couldn't wake him.
I got home, I couldn't wake him.

183
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,896
We both woke up sick this morning.

184
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,565
PARAMEDIC:
Watch your head.

185
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,651
[SAW BUZZING]

186
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,334
MEDICAL EXAMINER:
Hmm...

187
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:03,091
Well, the sulci are obliterated.
Let's look at the base.

188
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,264
Oh, my God.

189
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,058
You want me to take a sample, or?

190
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,769
I want you to move away from the table.

191
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,524
- Should I call someone, or?
- Call everyone.

192
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,411
CHEEVER: Well, these things happen
up there from time to time.

193
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,622
Meningitis in a college dorm
after a swim meet...

194
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,293
...or West Nile in some summer camp
near a lake.

195
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,547
I was reading that last summer they had
an outbreak of enterovirus encephalitis.

196
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,924
A hundred and three cases,
mainly children.

197
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,719
Well, it's probably too cold up there
for that right now.

198
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,847
As of last night,
there were five deaths and 32 cases.

199
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,016
There's a cluster
in an elementary school.

200
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,643
That's the kind of thing
you have to be prepared for.

201
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,395
It's gonna be all over the news.

202
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,440
What's your single overriding
communications objective?

203
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:04,152
We're isolating the sick and quarantining
those who we believe were exposed.

204
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,820
Okay, good.

205
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,781
As of this moment,
you and I are attached at the cell phone.

206
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,660
If you need resources, call me.
If you get into a political dogfight, call me.

207
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,830
If you find yourself wide awake,
staring at the walls at 3 a. M...

208
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,249
...wondering why you took the job,
call me.

209
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,668
DAVE: I sure hope you packed something
warmer than that.

210
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:24,380
We're looking at around zero
with the windchill.

211
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,592
Don't want you to catch cold.

212
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,931
Do you wanna go to the hotel first,
get situated?

213
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,683
MEARS:
I'd prefer to get started, if that's possible.

214
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,852
DAVE: Okay.
MEARS: How far is the office?

215
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,063
About a half-hour from here.

216
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,875
DOCTOR:
Your dad's in isolation.

217
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,420
You can go up to the window,
pick up the phone, and you can talk to him.

218
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,520
MITCH: Hey.
- Dad.

219
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,064
- Hey.
- Are you sick?

220
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,692
No, no, no. I'm... Uh...

221
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:29,445
This is all just, you know, a precaution.
They're, you know, just making sure.

222
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,240
But you were with them.
You could still get it.

223
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:36,536
No, I won't. Um,
they said this happens really, really fast.

224
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:40,248
And, uh, I'm fine.
There's nothing wrong with me.

225
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:44,127
There's nothing wrong with me.
We're okay. We're okay.

226
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,338
And Clark?

227
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,593
Yeah, you know, I, um...

228
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:59,183
I wasn't there.
I went, uh, in the ambulance with, uh, Beth.

229
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:03,062
And, uh, I just didn't... I...

230
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,190
I left him with, uh, Carrie Anne.

231
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,650
I should have been there.

232
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,611
- I could have helped.
- No, no, no. Honey, no, no.

233
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,780
It's good that you weren't there.
I'm happy.

234
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,034
If something had happened to you,
I mean, I'd...

235
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,288
Honey, you're here now, you know.
I'm happy about that.

236
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,498
I'm happy about that.

237
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,460
When are you coming home?

238
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,129
Soon. Very soon. They, you know...

239
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,466
- Why don't you go, uh, to your mom's?
- No.

240
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,886
- Just stay in Wisconsin.
- No. She doesn't need me.

241
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:39,348
She's got Dan. I live here.

242
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,520
You don't have anybody.
I'm not leaving you.

243
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:48,983
OFFICIAL 1: We have 47 cases
and eight deaths as of 5 this afternoon.

244
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,652
It's a weekend.
These numbers might be low.

245
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,864
People are staying home for a couple days,
see if they get better.

246
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,909
At this point, I think
we have to believe this is respiratory.

247
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,828
- Maybe fomites too.
- What's that, fomites?

248
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:04,207
Uh, it refers to transmission
from surfaces.

249
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,794
The average person touches their face
2- or 3000 times a day.

250
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:13,216
- Two- or 3000 times a day?
- Three to five times every waking minute.

251
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,344
In between, we're touching doorknobs...

252
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,222
...water fountains,
elevator buttons and each other.

253
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,808
Those things become fomites.

254
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:25,353
Is this something we wanna release
to the press? Respiratory and fomites?

255
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,190
- How's the public gonna react?
- Hard to say. A plastic shark in a movie...

256
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,860
...will keep people from getting
in the ocean, but a warning on cigarettes...

257
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:36,531
We need to walk the governor through this
before we freak everybody out.

258
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:40,910
I mean, heh, we can't even tell people
right now what they should be afraid of.

259
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,205
We tried that with swine flu.
All we did was get healthy people scared.

260
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,165
It's the biggest shopping weekend
of the year.

261
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,126
OFFICIAL 2:
We need to consider closing schools.

262
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,546
And who stays home with the kids?
People that work at stores.

263
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,965
Government workers.
People that work at hospitals.

264
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,677
When will we know what this is?
What causes it, what cures it?

265
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,138
Things that keep people calm.

266
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:04,976
What we need to determine is this:

267
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,895
For every person who gets sick...

268
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:11,649
...how many other people
are they likely to infect?

269
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,486
So for seasonal flu,
that's usually about one.

270
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,240
Smallpox, on the other hand,
it's over three.

271
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,867
Now, before we had a vaccine...

272
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:25,371
...polio spread at a rate
between four and six.

273
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,583
Now, we call that number...

274
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,960
...the R-nought.

275
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:35,965
R stands for the reproductive rate
of the virus.

276
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,426
Any ideas what that might be for this?

277
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,763
How fast it multiplies depends
on a variety of factors.

278
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,766
The incubation period,
how long a person is contagious.

279
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:49,187
Sometimes people can be contagious
without even having symptoms.

280
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,022
We need to know that too.

281
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,359
We need to know how big the population
of people susceptible to the virus might be.

282
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,613
So far that appears to be everyone
with hands, a mouth and a nose.

283
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,783
Once we know the R-nought, we'll be able
to get a handle on the scale of the epidemic.

284
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,786
So it's an epidemic now.
An epidemic of what?

285
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,747
We sent samples to the CDC.

286
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:13,294
In 72 hours, we'll know what it is,
if we're lucky.

287
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,296
Clearly, we're not lucky.

288

EISENBERG:
What do we got?

289
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:50,248
A young woman in Minnesota,
recently traveled to China.

290
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,541
Son also died.

291
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:57,338
As of this morning, 87 cases, 15 deaths.

- I worked.

You? Really?

Texas. Salmonella. Pretty limited.

- Mine was great, thanks.
- Oh.

296
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,699
It's pleomorphic,
but tends toward ovoid in shape.

297
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,785
I see structures on the surface
that look like glycoproteins...

298
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,371
...but there's nothing
morphologically pathognomonic.

299
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,541
We tested all her antibodies.
I didn't see much cross-reactivity.

300
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,086
Her body had no idea what to do with it.
It just kept amplifying.

301

HEXTALL:
Send it to Sussman in San Francisco.

302
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,382
If he doesn't know what it is,
nobody does.

303
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:46,178
It shows novel characteristics
and appears to be chimeric in origin.

304
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:52,310
Virus is 15 to 19 kilobases in length
and containing six to 10 genes.

305
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,186
Typical of a paramyxovirus.

306
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:58,983
It's Godzilla, King Kong
and Frankenstein all in one.

- Where'd it come from? Military?

You're not a doctor
and you're not a writer.

Yes, I am a writer. Yes, I am.

311
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:13,205
Blogging is not writing.
It's graffiti with punctuation.

312
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:17,084
I am a journalist, and there's
informed discussion on the blogosphere...

313
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,253
...that this is a biological weapon.

314
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:23,424
You wanna talk to me,
call my office and make an appointment.

315

FRENCH: Dr. Cheever?
- Yes.

316
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:32,266
- Do you have a moment?
- Sure.

317
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,770
We found him. Tell the unit
on the way to his house to come in.

318
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,189
Excuse me. Who are you?

319
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,442
My name is Dennis French
with the Department of Homeland Security.

320
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,444
And what's this all about?

321
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,947
Rear Admiral Haggerty's expecting us
in the emergency operations center.

322
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,283
We can discuss it there.

323
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,285
FRENCH:
This happened in Kowloon.

324
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:55,456
Today we've got workers at a casino
in Macao striking over conditions.

325
00:22:55,624 --> 00:23:00,127
Three have died in one bunkhouse.

The blue is virus, and the gold is human,
and the red is the viral attachment protein...

...and the green is its receptor
in the human cells.
