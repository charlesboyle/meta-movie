1
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,150
<i>Front door!</i>

2
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,570
I can't let it in unless I see it.

3
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,280
I know what the rules are.
I'm just asking if you can make an exception.

4
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,320
There are no exceptions.
That's why we have rules.

5
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,530
I know what a rule is. I'm just telling you...

6
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,870
You don't have an X-ray machine back there?

7
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,750
You don't have an X-ray machine?

8
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,000
No. I've got to see it.

9
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,440
<i>I bet you're not
going to miss that drive.</i>

10
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,900
Or the ambiance.

11
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,110
I would've gone a lot further.

12
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,540
You know, they gave
me a brochure on reintegrating.

13
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,790
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,830
A social worker came by.

15
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,130
What did he say?

16
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,340
Go slow.

17
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,300
We can go slow.

18
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,650
Hey.
Hey.

19
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,280
I just wanted to remind
you that I won't be coming in tomorrow.

20
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,110
That's right. It's the big day!

21
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,450
You must be thrilled...

22
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,620
Yeah.

23
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,120
...and excited and nervous and...

24
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,500
And I wanted to thank you,
just for everything.

25
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,170
You've been so understanding.

26
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,920
Oh, I'm sure there's
more to it than what's on the news, so...

27
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,840
I know, but to a lot
of people you say "insider trading,"

28
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,180
and it may as well be murder.
You just stop existing.

29
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,350
So, thank you for everything.

30
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,900
I wasn't sure what I should wear.

31
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,150
I tried to find something new to buy,

32
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,360
but I couldn't find anything that looked good.

33
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,610
Honey, you look beautiful.

34
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,450
And I can only
imagine how you're gonna look to him.

35
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,100
- Oh!
- Oh, Mama.

36
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,720
Oh.

37
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,060
Come on. Let's get
out of here before they change their mind.

38
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,170
I'm sorry.

39
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,140
<i>Babe, you remember
that hedge fund manager I met inside?</i>

40
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,430
Marshall Hellman?

41
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,440
The Stanford guy?
- Yeah.

42
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,270
Super smart. He was
in for some tax thing, but he'll be out soon.

43
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,950
He's got money in Dubai
and a lot of connections.

44
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,120
I can get us back to where we were, Em.

45
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,620
I promise. I can make that happen.

46
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,290
Okay, baby.

47
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,890
Thank you.

48
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,820
I don't understand
what you're saying! Just relax!

49
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,490
Hello.

50
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,040
I'm Dr. Banks.

51
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,330
This guy's on something, okay?
Listen, just relax!

52
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,040
- Officer.
- This guy's on something.

53
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,000
He came swinging at me.

54
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,170
Stand back and let me talk to him.

55
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,340
He was trying to hold up a taxi.

56
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,710
You understand? He came at me!

57
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,610
Augustin? Augustin.

58
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,570
He's fine.

59
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,930
What is it? What's going on?

60
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,770
He saw
his dead father driving the taxi.

61
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,520
What?

62
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,810
He saw the ghost of his father.
He was a cabbie.

63
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,770
So I was right. He's nuts.

64
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,770
No. It's grief.

65
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,610
Just grief painting pictures in his brain.

66
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,360
He sees ghosts.

67
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,120
He's Haitian. It's not unusual for Haitians

68
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,620
to see their loved ones shortly after they die.

69
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,710
Weird for me and you,
but it's perfectly normal for him.

70
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,290
Right, what do you have next?

71
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,630
MVA in bed eight,
with minor head trauma, in need of a consult.

72
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,840
Double shift today?

73
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,430
Better living through chemistry.

74
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,600
Miss Taylor.

75
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,440
- Yeah?
- I'm Dr. Banks.

76
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,570
Oh, they said I might have a concussion,

77
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,440
but I don't have to stay here for that, right?

78
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,450
Uh, we have to wait
for the CT scan results to know that.

79
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,950
I have a couple of questions for you.

80
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,740
How's your head?

81
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,660
It hurts.

82
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,950
How was it before you hit the wall?

83
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,660
What do you mean?

84
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,620
How have things been going with you?

85
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,590
Generally speaking.

86
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,470
Why are you here?

87
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,340
I'm a psychiatrist, Miss Taylor.

88
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,180
Normally,

89
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,770
when people hit things with their car,

90
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,310
there are skid marks on the pavement.

91
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,190
A brick wall's
a pretty good reason to use the brakes,

92
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,360
turn the wheel.

93
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,530
You didn't do that. You went straight in.

94
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,490
It says here the attendant told the police

95
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,870
you were pretty upset
before you got in the car.

96
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,080
Now, the insurance company
are gonna check the brakes,

97
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,120
but I prefer to just ask you.

98
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,040
Did you try to hurt yourself this morning?

99
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,350
Do you still want to try and hurt yourself?

100
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,270
Emily.

101
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,400
How do you feel
about staying here for a few days?

102
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,450
- Here?
- Mmm.

103
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,410
No, I can't stay here.

104
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,330
Martin just got home
and I have to be there for him.

105
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,910
Is that your husband, Martin?

106
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,540
Yes, and he just got out of prison.

107
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,380
I have to be there, and I have a job.
I have to go into work.

108
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,920
He doesn't make any money yet.

109
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,220
Are you married?

110
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,930
Yes.

111
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,260
Okay, what if you got out of jail

112
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,680
or you were away
for a long time and you come home

113
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,600
and your wife is in the mental hospital?

114
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:04,730
We waited for four years. I can't stay here.

115
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,610
I think you may have
tried to hurt yourself this morning, and...

116
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,530
It was a mistake. I lost it for a minute.

117
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,780
I promise, that's not going to happen again.

118
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,120
- Do you have an office?
- Mmm.

119
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,080
Well, I could come see you at your office.

120
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,370
I could come as often as you want.

121
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,120
I could come two or three times a week.

122
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,960
I was in therapy once before,

123
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,840
and I remember that
structure really helps with hopelessness.

124
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,970
I promise. I just really want to go home.

125
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,010
Okay. So we'll release her to you,

126
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,310
um, but I want to see her
in my office this week.

127
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,270
That's the deal we made.

128
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,770
I just had no idea this was still going on.

129
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,150
Oh, honey, I think
she must have been putting on a brave face.

130
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,690
She was afraid to tell you.
She was afraid to tell me.

131
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,820
I want to start her on this. It's called an SSRI.

132
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,240
It affects the neurotransmitter in the brain
called serotonin.

133
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,160
<i>What does that do exactly?</i>

134
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,160
<i>Basically, it helps stop the brain
from telling you you're sad.</i>

135
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:05,000
<i>In a few weeks, she should start to feel better.</i>

136
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,960
No, of course. Of course.

137
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:14,380
It was soft.
Absolutely, it was soft in that first...

138
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,640
But we are going to tighten it up.

139
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,100
Sure, that's what we do.

140
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:25,230
Yeah. I think it'll be interesting to regroup
after the Dallas groups.

141
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,560
Emily?

142
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,820
Are you okay?

143
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,580
Emily?

144
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,170
Aww!

145
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,390
What happened?

146
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,720
Oh!

147
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,730
These made me sick, too.

148
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,230
I had better luck with Celexa.

149
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,410
<i>I used to draw when I was a kid.
Mostly people, though.</i>

150
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,660
Teachers and kids from my class.

151
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,120
Boys that I liked.

152
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,040
Sometimes cats.

153
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,840
I used to try and get their faces perfect.

154
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,340
That's why I came to New York,
I wanted to get into graphic design.

155
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,050
I was taking classes when I met Martin.

156
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,560
How did that happen?

157
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:51,270
I was working at this, uh,
bar downtown to help pay for school,

158
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,320
and he kept coming in after work.

159
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,740
And he would just order
the most complicated drinks.

160
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,400
Things that I had no idea how to make.

161
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,700
One night, he climbed over the bar

162
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,450
and offered to teach me how to make them.

163
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,000
And he ended up staying until we closed.
Then he asked me out.

164
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,960
And you went.

165
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,340
I didn't know who he was or what he did.
He was just...

166
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,840
He was just this guy in a suit.

167
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,640
And watched me while I made drinks,

168
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,640
and that made me really nervous.

169
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,020
Then he stared at me like I was a painting.

170
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,360
He had this beautiful sailboat,
and he took me out on it.

171
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,530
Taught me how to ski.

172
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,530
He swept me off my feet.

173
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:49,040
Proposed to me in Maui that winter
and we were married by spring.

174
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,460
How old were you?

175
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,840
That was five years ago, so I was 23.

176
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,720
Time goes by so fast.

177
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,230
Is this ever going to go away?

178
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,020
You said you felt depressed before.

179
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,400
Did you see anyone about it last time?

180
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,320
Yeah. In Greenwich, Connecticut.
Victoria Siebert.

181
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,450
I had to stop seeing her
when they took our house away

182
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:28,240
and I had to move back to the city.

183
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,200
Do you mind if I contact Dr. Siebert
about your history?

184
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,910
No, of course not.

185
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,960
<i>I saw her four years ago.
Mmm.</i>

186
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,380
For a little over nine months.

187
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,130
She didn't just
have the rug pulled from under her,

188
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,380
she had the rug, the home, the husband.

189
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,630
Her entire life, gone.

190
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,770
Even her health insurance.
She moved into the city to find work

191
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,680
and I never heard from her again.

192
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,610
I'm glad she's seeing a man this time.
I think that will help.

193
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,690
Why is that?

194
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,400
Never felt seen by her father.

195
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,280
Then her husband ends up in jail
and she's abandoned again.

196
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,870
I'd be happy to see her have
a different kind of experience.

197
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,120
She says you tried her on medication.

198
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:19,040
Oh, yes. Wellbutrin. Prozac. Effexor.

199
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,630
- Really struggled.
- Mmm.

200
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,630
I remember she had problems
with sleep and nausea. Chills...

201
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,260
I'm putting her on Zoloft,
see if she can tolerate that.

202
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,640
Oh. Well, maybe she's a candidate
for one of these newer meds.

203
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,140
Sometimes the newest thing
gives them confidence.

204
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,400
They see the ads on TV, they believe.

205
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,610
I have a patient with some similar issues.

206
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,570
I put her on Ablixa.

207
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,610
Welcome, everyone!
Thank you for coming.

208
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,410
We'll be starting the presentations soon,

209
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,530
so if everyone can come in and take a seat.

210
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:56,000
You know, I may have
some samples here. Let me see.

211
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,580
No. I must have given them all away.

212
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,630
Here! Have an Ablixa pen.

213
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,760
Had it been available back then,

214
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,140
I would have prescribed it for Emily
after she miscarried.

215
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,350
- Miscarried?
- Hmm.

216
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,390
After he went to jail.

217
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,560
She, uh, hasn't mentioned that.

218
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,930
- No?
- No.

219
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,310
Has he been released yet?

220
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,980
- A week ago.
- Oh!

221
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,860
Well, maybe that will help turn things around.

222
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,940
Hmm.

223
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,030
Look, don't mention anything
to Carl or Kayla

224
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,780
about Hellman. It'll just make things easier.

225
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,620
I still think
Carl's the one who went to the Feds.

226
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,250
He probably gave us these tickets

227
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,170
because he feels shitty about everything.

228
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,340
I hope these things work.

229
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,130
Hey.

230
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,020
Look, if you don't feel up to this,
I can go by myself.

231
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,690
I understand
if you don't want to see those people.

232
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,980
<i>All right?</i>

233
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,360
<i>But I got to get back out there at some point.</i>

234
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,530
<i>If I just sit here by myself,
I'm just gonna feel worse.</i>

235
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,200
<i>I have to at least try.
Dr. Banks would want me to try.</i>

236
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,790
Carl?

237
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,800
Martin! Welcome back.

238
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,210
How are you, sir?
- Hi!

239
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,840
Emily, good to see you.
- Hi. Good to see you.

240
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,970
Kayla, you remember this beautiful lady here.

241
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,050
Hi.

242
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,180
Thank you so much for having us.

243
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,390
Oh, my, your dress is beautiful!
I love it. It's gorgeous.

244
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,480
Thank you.
We're so glad you guys could come.

245
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,560
It's our pleasure. Thanks again.

246
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,400
I'm going to go to the bar and get a drink.
Does anyone want anything?

247
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,900
Is that such a good idea?

248
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,410
Yeah, it's fine. I'll be right back.

249
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,740
She looks amazing!

250
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,700
She's doing well.

251
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,040
But going away is hard,
and so is coming back, for everyone.

252
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,540
Martin, I just want to say I wish I had done

253
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,090
a better job of reaching out. I really do.

254
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:12,510
No. That's fine. It's the culture. It's over now.

255
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,430
Good evening, ma'am.
Can I get you something?

256
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,850
Yes, a vodka seltzer, please.

257
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,950
There you go. Enjoy.

258
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,280
Thank you.

259
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,040
Em. So, Martin was just telling...

260
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,630
Honey, what's wrong?

261
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,050
I can't do this.

262
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:04,060
You know, I went through
a very bad time last year.

263
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,980
I found a lump.

264
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,900
I just fell apart. I was so depressed,

265
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,240
and, uh, my doctor prescribed
something called Effexor.

266
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,820
It really helped.

267
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,330
Can you get Martin for me?

268
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,120
Yeah.

269
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,370
Hey.

270
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,120
I'm sorry.

271
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:09,210
I'm sorry! I can't, I'm sorry.

272
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,340
It's okay, it's okay.

273
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,840
Come here.

274
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,120
Not so close, ma'am!

275
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,920
Thank you.

276
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,590
Oh, the advantages of having
a husband who can write prescriptions.

277
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,560
What are they called again?

278
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,520
- It's a beta blocker.
- Hmm.

279
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,400
Is it bad that I'm doing this?

280
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,820
Everyone takes them.

281
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,980
Lawyers, musicians.

282
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,320
People going to interviews for big jobs.

283
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,160
It doesn't make you anything you're not.

284
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,700
It just makes it easier
for you to be who you are.

285
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,830
It's between me and two other people.

286
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,540
A woman from Merrill and a guy from Citicorp.

287
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,500
But Hazlitt says I have the inside track.

288
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:21,590
Sorry, D. I've got to return this.
It's an emergency.

289
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,590
This girl is really struggling.

290
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,010
Dr. Banks, I really need to talk to you.

291
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,060
Emily.

292
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,020
Yeah. I just got your message.

293
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,100
I'm with my wife.

294
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:40,610
I went to your office, but you weren't there.
So I came here.

295
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,200
Could we just go talk?

296
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,410
If it's an emergency, I can admit you.

297
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,370
No. I just, um...

298
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,540
I was getting on the subway and...

299
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,710
And I was like when I was in the car.

300
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,550
I have to go to work. I just need five minutes.

301
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,930
You're going to go to work after?

302
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,930
- Okay, five minutes.
- Okay.

303
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,890
I'm sorry.

304
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,350
Call me after the interview.

305
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,320
<i>Emily, I know this is hard.</i>

306
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,080
<i>But the hopelessness
you're feeling is a symptom.</i>

307
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,080
<i>We have to leave that in the past.</i>

308
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,870
A psychologist once said,

309
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,580
"Depression is an inability
to construct a future. "

310
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:42,460
But you have a future. At home with Martin.

311
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,970
He's trying to start a new business.

312
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,680
With this guy Hellman that he met in jail.

313
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,970
How does that make you feel?

314
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,350
I don't know. I mean, he's trying.

315
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,110
He's really trying to make things better

316
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,110
and I'm just not helping at all.

317
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,280
I mean, I'm trying, too. I went...

318
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,620
I went shopping to try and make things
more exciting for him.

319
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,490
You are trying.

320
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,080
I can't take the Zoloft anymore.
I can't. I'm dizzy.

321
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,420
I can't sleep. I have no sex drive.

322
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,460
I understand that.

323
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,470
This woman I work with, Julia, she...

324
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,050
She said she's on this other,
new medication,

325
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,430
and it's really helping her.

326
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,310
I thought maybe I could try that.

327
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,480
Taylor!

328
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,400
Have you taken Ablixa before?

329
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,700
No.

330
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,490
Some of the side effects may include

331
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,660
<i>nausea, muscle weakness,
insomnia, change in appetite,</i>

332
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,620
<i>dry mouth, irritation.</i>

333
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,670
<i>Do you want to pay cash?</i>

334
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,790
<i>There were court seats
at Knicks games, fishing trips</i>

335
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,670
to Cape Cod. It was crazy.

336
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,720
One year,
Warner-Lambert took us to Hawaii.

337
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:11,680
I gave a talk for five minutes
and played 36 holes.

338
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,350
What did Pfizer have to pay
to make their whole thing go away?

339
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,470
Two billion?

340
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,850
Lilly paid over a billion
to settle the Zyprexa thing.

341
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,190
Do we have to talk about this?
You're ruining my lunch.

342
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,400
A certain rep, who will remain nameless,

343
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,230
gave me tickets to the World Series.

344
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,990
- Got my son an autographed ball!
- Hmm.

345
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,700
If only I'd known you liked baseball.

346
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,570
Where was I for all this?

347
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,200
Some British
boarding school, probably.

348
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,000
Well, it's not a violation of the pharma code
to buy you doctors lunch

349
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,000
as long as we talk about business
for at least five minutes.

350
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,420
Ready? Go!

351
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:46,380
We're starting a trial
for our new anti-anxiety drug, Delatrex.

352
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,090
We're looking for a couple of docs to consult.

353
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,390
It's probably going
to run for about a year. Any interest?

354
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:55,890
I'm out. I'm doing something
for the competition. Signed an NDA.

355
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,520
You should cancel her filet for that.

356
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,270
I'm teaching next semester
and feeling a little overextended.

357
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,400
How about you, Dr. Banks?
Too busy?

358
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,190
Not as busy as my partners.
What do you need?

359
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,190
<i>Getting warmer, but, no.</i>

360
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,570
Uh...

361
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,280
- Thirty thousand?
- Ah!

362
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,200
Fifty thousand.

363
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,580
- Really? Wow.
- Yes.

364
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,870
Really.

365
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,870
What do you have to do?

366
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,710
Go to a few meetings,
recruit some patients, track some data.

367
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,710
So you'll be even busier.

368
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,010
Yes.

369
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,260
But the flip side is

370
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,430
that if, for instance,

371
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:40,560
the buttons on this shirt

372
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,440
suddenly fell off,

373
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,560
I would be able to buy a new one.

374
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,480
Oh, I see.

375
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,440
Mom?

376
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,150
Mmm.

377
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:57,120
Yes, honey!
In here, sweetie. Just unpacking.

378
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,950
I was having a bad dream.

379
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,450
- Oh, love.
- Oh!

380
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,830
Honey, you're in luck.
Jon is very good with dreams.

381
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,500
- Yes, I am.
- So, he's gonna help you.

382
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,670
Back to bed, sweetie.

383
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,840
Do I have to dream when I sleep?

384
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,390
Yeah, I'm pretty much sure we all do.

385
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,510
They don't all have to be bad.

386
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,890
Albert Einstein, remember him?

387
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,100
Yeah.

388
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,310
He figured out relativity in a dream.

389
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,020
And Paul McCartney wrote entire songs.

390
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,280
And I dreamt of your mom
before I even met her.

391
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,160
So what are you going to dream about?

392
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:33,880
Whoever makes this drug
is going to be fucking rich.

393
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,780
Em!

394
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:05,830
Em! It's the middle of the night.
Turn down the music!

395
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,790
Em?

396
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,380
Are we expecting someone?

397
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,470
Em, can you hear me?

398
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,270
What are you doing?

399
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:32,060
<i>Can't she stop taking drugs?</i>

400
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,150
- Isn't there an alternative approach...
- No!

401
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,610
God, no. I can finally sleep.

402
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,150
I have some energy. We had sex.

403
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,820
It was like we were actually together.

404
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,120
Maybe something else
would do the same thing.

405
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,120
Absolutely. There are still other SSRIs, SNRIs.

406
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,330
No.

407
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,790
I've tried everything else.
You don't know, Martin.

408
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,960
You've never had this.
You don't know what it's like.

409
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,510
Okay? Every afternoon it's like...

410
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,430
It's like there's this poisonous fog bank

411
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:06,010
rolling in on my mind, and I'm paralyzed.

412
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:11,350
If I have to start over,
I think I should see a different doctor.

413
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,690
I'm sorry you feel that way.

414
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,900
I understand your frustration.

415
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,150
What do we do?

416
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,620
There are things we can do
to make this work.

417
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,700
<i>Other medications we add to the Ablixa,</i>

418
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,450
<i>one is designed to deal with sleepwalking</i>

419
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:32,330
<i>while the Ablixa helps you get a handle
on your depression.</i>

420
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,580
I'm going to Otisville today.

421
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,550
They finally approved me to see Hellman.

422
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,300
He's thinking we might want to
set up shop in Houston.

423
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,560
He's got a lot of connections down there.

424
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,520
I thought we were going
to move back to Greenwich.

425
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:56,980
I'm sure that we can
find great people in Houston, too.

426
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:03,070
I want to be totally clear that I am being paid
to participate in this study.

427
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,570
If you don't want to take part,
I totally understand.

428
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,410
There are other meds
besides Delatrex I can prescribe.

429
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,750
So, my medication is free.

430
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,540
I don't have to report it
to my insurance company or anything?

431
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:20,000
For as long as you choose to be a part
of the study, your meds are free.

432
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,920
Oh, that's great.

433
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,720
We'll start today.

434
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:43,900
<i>Emily, I don't understand.
It's almost 4:00.</i>

435
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,410
<i>What happened?</i>

436
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,330
I got on the train, and I just forgot to get off.

437
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,580
Martin is thinking about moving us,

438
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,920
and I'm just

439
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,010
really...

440
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,260
Go home, Emily.

441
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,100
But you have to know this can't happen again.

442
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,100
It's not working for me.

443
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,600
Hey.

444
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,110
Hey. Hey.

445
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,490
What's happening?

446
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,410
They gave it to the guy from Citicorp.

447
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,080
Oh, I'm sorry, D.

448
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,040
It's fucking hopeless.

449
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,650
Emily?

450
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,490
Hellman says you are going to love Houston.

451
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,530
What'd you get me?

452
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,500
Em?

453
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,000
Em?

454
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,010
God damn it. Em?

455
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,010
These fucking pills.

456
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,930
Em.

457
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,850
You sleeping again?

458
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,980
Stop!

459
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,570
Ahh!

460
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,460
Em, call somebody.

461
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,090
Help me.

462
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,010
Call somebody.

463
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,840
Help me.

464
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,990
Did he hit you?

465
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,410
Did he threaten you?

466
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,760
Was anyone else here?
Who else was coming for dinner?

467
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,800
What?

468
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,310
I was asleep and I...

469
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,230
I woke up and I saw him. He wasn't...

470
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,810
He wasn't moving.

471
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,650
And that's all... That's all I remember.

472
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,410
<i>Dr. Siebert.</i>

473
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,030
Hello, there. I'm sorry to bother you.
It's Jon Banks.

474
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:42,990
It's about Emily.

475
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,540
<i>Uh, there's been an incident.</i>

476
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,040
<i>No sign of forced entry,</i>

477
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,960
<i>nobody else on the building security camera.</i>

478
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,170
The prints on the knife are hers.

479
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,710
Where is her lawyer?

480
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:55,050
She doesn't have one.
Just kept talking about you.

481
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,720
No sign of struggle on either one of them.

482
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,090
She made the 911 call herself.

483
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,760
We had an appointment last night
that she didn't show up for.

484
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,520
When was the last time you saw her?

485
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,680
Four days ago.

486
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,440
And what was she like?

487
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:14,110
Any idea why the dinner table
was set for three, Dr. Banks?

488
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:18,280
She doesn't remember anything
about a guest. Kids?

489
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,660
No, she didn't have children.

490
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,950
She was taking these.

491
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,620
For depression, right? I've seen the ads.

492
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,410
She ever talk to you
about something like this?

493
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,620
I'd like to speak to her, if that's possible.

494
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,250
You can talk to her at Rikers.

495
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:34,750
It's possible, you see, that she was asleep.

496
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,470
What?

497
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,630
She walks in her sleep.

498
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,260
That's maybe why she doesn't
remember anything.

499
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,260
It's a side effect of this medication.

500
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:46,810
She's had other episodes.

501
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,480
She kills people in her sleep, too.

502
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,780
Stand up, please. And turn around.

503
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:02,320
<i>She ever tell you anything to</i>

504
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:05,620
make you believe she could be violent,
or that he was?

505
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,500
And before you answer that

506
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:11,920
or tell me about some kind of
patient-doctor confidentiality thing,

507
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,040
let's just think about the future here.

508
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,340
The future?

509
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,340
Well, this goes one of two ways, doesn't it?

510
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,850
See, either she's a murderer or

511
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:29,140
she's a victim of her medical treatment.

512
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:33,190
In which case,
you're the target of a big civil suit.

513
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:37,190
<i>Either way, someone gets punished.</i>

514
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,280
<i>Her or you.</i>

515
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,280
<i>The state's enjoyed working with you
in the past, Dr. Banks.</i>

516
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,830
<i>I'd like to see you
consulting with us on this one.</i>

517
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,040
This is different.

518
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,210
Is it?

519
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,550
I never want to see another pill again.

520
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,550
They want me to take something else.

521
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,520
Another pill to help me sleep.

522
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:16,520
I don't understand why this is happening.

523
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,240
Is there any way that

524
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,910
somebody else did it,

525
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,410
and made it look like me?

526
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:34,330
I don't think so.

527
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,800
That's not what the police are saying.

528
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,890
I killed the wrong person.

529
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,980
I don't know what else
I could have done.

530
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,440
She wanted to stay on it.

531
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,070
Jon. You can't follow them around

532
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,730
taking things out of their hands

533
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,900
they might use to hurt themselves.

534
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,240
We see them for an hour a day,
maybe a couple of times a week.

535
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,070
I think they're going to charge her.

536
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,490
With what?

537
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:13,620
You said she has no memory.
No criminal intent.

538
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,580
They can't do that.

539
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,630
<i>A man in Arizona.</i>

540
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,710
He killed his wife, threw her in the pool,

541
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,260
took off his bloody clothes,
put them in the trunk of his car.

542
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,760
Woke up the next morning, no memory of it.

543
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,140
Didn't even know she was dead until
they charged him with the crime.

544
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,100
Neighbors even saw him
throw the body into the pool.

545
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,640
He was acquitted last year.

546
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:38,650
A woman bludgeoned her husband
while on vacation in Sanibel Island.

547
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:42,150
They were both asleep at the time.
Another acquittal.

548
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:45,190
I have to tell you,
I have been approached by the state

549
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,780
to consult for them as well.

550
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,660
I assumed as much.

551
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:53,080
I am in a rather difficult spot here.
I hope you appreciate that.

552
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,580
I know you are, but if she goes away,

553
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,660
this does not look good for you.

554
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,960
It just makes the whole system look bad.

555
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:04,000
She ever talk about killing her husband?

556
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,970
No. If she had, I would have reported it.

557
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,010
You spoken to any of the family?

558
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,390
Martin's mother. She's the one who hired me.

559
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:16,230
We need your help.

560
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,570
You want to talk about it?

561
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,370
A patient of mine was arrested.

562
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:36,040
For something bad?

563
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:38,710
Yeah. Pretty bad.

564
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,590
Did the person do it?

565
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,630
Are they guilty?

566
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,180
In this case,

567
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,850
those are two very different things.

568
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:42,230
I was afraid you would
never want to see me again.

569
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:49,610
I hope you know that if I could
trade places with Martin, I would.

570
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:54,070
I would give anything if there were
someone who could make that deal.

571
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,790
I just don't understand
how it happened. How?

572
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:00,290
I don't know.

573
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,790
I don't know. It doesn't fit for me. It's like...

574
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:09,340
It's like it never happened.

575
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,880
But I don't understand it.

576
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:15,970
You watch the commercials on TV,
people are getting better!

577
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,930
I was getting better.
Dr. Banks was really helping me.

578
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,850
But, he just got out

579
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,560
and now he's gone.

580
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,900
I know.

581
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:33,200
Can I give you something?

582
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:35,610
What?

583
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,910
I want to make a statement.

584
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,840
People need to know what can happen.

585
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,760
For Martin's sake.

586
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:52,880
<i>"We go to doctors</i>

587
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:55,260
<i>"with our sadness</i>

588
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,180
<i>"and our faith in the hope
they will guide us toward health.</i>

589
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:02,600
<i>"But instead I have
gone down a path toward a misery</i>

590
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:05,140
<i>"I never could have imagined.</i>

591
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,310
<i>"And I have taken my loved ones with me.</i>

592
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:13,780
<i>"My only hope is that
no one else follows me to this place. "</i>

593
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,700
<i>And again, this is a note
from your daughter-in-law.</i>

594
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:18,820
<i>Yes.</i>

595
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:20,990
<i>Who may face murder charges.</i>

596
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,080
<i>Yes.</i>

597
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:24,660
<i>For what a drug made her do.</i>

598
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:29,540
<i>We invited a representative
from Sadler-Benelux, the makers of Ablixa,</i>

599
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,340
<i>to come here this morning</i>

600
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,050
<i>and discuss this very tragic story,
but they declined.</i>

601
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:37,260
<i>However, our Dr. Peter Joubert,
in fact, a Manhattan psychiatrist</i>

602
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:40,180
<i>who specializes in
anti-depression drugs like Ablixa,</i>

603
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,350
<i>is here to discuss</i>

604
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:43,100
<i>the dangers of these side effects.</i>

605
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:46,560
<i>Peter, if nothing else,
this seems a very troubling gray area.</i>

606
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,520
<i>Josh, it is. And that is why the FDA, in 2004,</i>

607
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,610
<i>asked that anti-depressants
come with a black box warning...</i>

608
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,030
Which one, zucchini or asparagus?

609
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:57,150
<i>...because their use was
associated with an increased risk</i>

610
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,530
<i>of suicidality in children and adolescents.</i>

611
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:02,580
- Zucchini or asparagus?
- I don't know. Both.

612
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:05,080
<i>That warning was expanded to
include young adults in their 20s.</i>

613
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,000
<i>Peter, where's the doctor
in all this?</i>

614
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,830
<i>What's his or her responsibility?</i>

615
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,380
<i>I'm sure people have a lot
of questions for him.</i>

616
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,170
What about the permission slip
for the field trip?

617
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,420
Do you have that?

618
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:19,220
Did you remember? Are you excited? What?

619
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:23,220
- There he is! Dr. Banks!
Did someone famous...

620
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:25,470
How long have you been seeing Emily Taylor?

621
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,560
Seeing who?

622
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,730
Did you know that your husband
was treating Emily Taylor?

623
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:29,940
Take him out of here.

624
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,060
What is happening?

625
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,270
Go that way!

626
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,360
What about this picture?

627
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,650
<i>Have you seen the front page
of the Post today?</i>

628
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:35,990
You have no comment about any of this?

629
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:37,900
No, not at the moment.

630
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:39,070
Do you have any comment at all about this?

631
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,070
I have no comment.
She's my patient. That's all I can say.

632
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,240
What's your relationship?

633
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:45,910
I saw some press people downstairs.

634
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,830
I think they had cameras.

635
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:51,420
Is that for you?

636
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:56,760
There's a back stairway,

637
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,760
if you'd be more comfortable leaving that way.

638
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,140
My wife never liked me coming here.

639
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:12,480
I'm worried she's going to see something.

640
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,610
It's going to be a "thing. "

641
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:19,610
Was she the one with the blonde hair?

642
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:24,530
I think I saw her in the elevator.
She seemed totally normal.

643
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,200
I'd really like to focus more
on what's going on with you.

644
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:29,960
What was she taking?
It's not what I'm taking, is it?

645
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,290
No. You're taking something else.

646
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,800
You'd... You'd tell me, right?

647
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,920
As part of the Office's
medical conduct review,

648
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,720
we'll need to have access
to your charts and records.

649
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,180
Current and past patients.

650
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,640
Absolutely. Whatever you need.

651
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,980
You went to school in the UK, at Durham.

652
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,070
Mmm.

653
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:59,940
What made you decide
to practice here in the States?

654
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:04,740
Where I come from,
if anyone goes to see a psychiatrist

655
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,490
or takes medication,
the assumption is they're sick.

656
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,910
Here, the assumption is they're getting better.

657
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,160
I see.

658
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:17,170
You first came in contact with
Miss Taylor after a suicide attempt.

659
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,050
She drove her car into a wall.

660
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:24,010
You decided not to hospitalize her?

661
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:29,350
She described her suicide attempt
as a mistake.

662
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,100
And expressed a desire to get better.

663
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:35,940
Her husband wanted her home as well.

664
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,190
In addition,
she had no history of violent behavior.

665
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:43,700
Driving a car into a wall isn't violent?

666
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:48,200
I didn't think she posed a risk to others.

667
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:51,200
I saw her regularly, here in my office,

668
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:53,960
and consulted with
her previous doctor as well.

669
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,620
- Dr. Siebert.
- Hmm.

670
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:58,040
I've spoken to her.

671
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:03,510
You also do work at the hospital,
a number of shifts.

672
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,050
Sometimes nights.

673
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:09,560
And you said you're doing
pharmaceutical consulting.

674
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:12,730
That's a pretty large workload.

675
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:16,150
My wife lost her job.

676
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,400
And we have a boy,
my stepson, in private school.

677
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,400
I bought a new place downtown, too.

678
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:32,450
So, longer hours,
higher volume of patients, more stress.

679
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:48,720
Anything else?

680
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:55,020
I'll need to ask your partners
some questions.

681
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,560
Of course.

682
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:03,190
<i>They can't come after you
for any of this, right?</i>

683
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:06,490
<i>No, that's not going to happen.</i>

684
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:08,660
They don't blame me.

685
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,950
I'm just an expert witness.

686
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:17,790
Like I was on that case
with the kid from Uganda

687
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:20,420
who couldn't stop stealing stuff.

688
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,840
They just need me to explain things
to the jury. That's all.

689
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,640
So after the trial, it's over.

690
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,470
Absolutely.

691
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:37,980
<i>She was sad. Very sad.</i>

692
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,400
Every day.

693
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,690
Did she say why?

694
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:46,650
No. It is just how she was.

695
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,110
<i>Some people slip.</i>

696
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,320
Some jump. We keep an eye out.

697
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:57,000
I remember her. Right on the edge.

698
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:00,000
She worried me.

699
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:02,670
<i>What makes us human?</i>

700
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,590
What differentiates us from, let's say, insects,

701
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:07,760
is that we have consciousness.

702
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:12,010
An awareness of what we're thinking
and what we're doing.

703
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:17,020
If, for example, I'm hungry,
I am consciously aware of that.

704
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:20,940
And so, I go to the fridge
and I make myself a sandwich.

705
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:24,190
So you intend to make a sandwich.

706
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:25,440
Yes.

707
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:31,320
So, what you are saying is that to have intent,

708
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,780
we must also have consciousness.

709
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:34,700
Objection, Your Honor.

710
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,620
The question calls for a legal conclusion,
not a medical one.

711
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:39,910
Overruled.

712
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:42,040
You may continue.

713
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,130
Consciousness provides a context,

714
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:48,130
or meaning, for our actions.

715
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:50,880
If that part of you doesn't exist, then,

716
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:53,970
basically, we are functioning
much like an insect,

717
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:57,310
where you just respond instinctively

718
00:52:57,390 --> 00:52:59,890
without a thought to what your actions mean.

719
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,730
And that part...

720
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:04,690
That part that provides meaning to action,

721
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,320
does that exist when we're asleep?

722
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,980
No.
- No.

723
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,660
So, without consciousness,
how do we prove intent?

724
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:14,740
I don't believe you can.

725
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,490
<i>I think she'll take it.</i>

726
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:21,330
But she does not walk out
of the hospital next week, or next month.

727
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,170
She goes away for a while.
That's part of the deal.

728
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:24,420
She'll have to agree to that.

729
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,420
You think that'll work?

730
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:30,760
I can get Dr. Banks to help explain it to her.

731
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,180
Here's what we're prepared to live with.

732
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,180
State agrees to an NGRI.

733
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:39,010
We make a side agreement about
how long she's institutionalized

734
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,430
before there's any sort of hearing
on her release.

735
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:44,770
So I'm not guilty, but I'm still going away?

736
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:47,770
NGRI means
Not Guilty for Reasons of Insanity.

737
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,690
You're not guilty of murder.

738
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:52,490
You'll be moved to the Wards Island
Forensic Psychiatry Center

739
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:53,610
for a period of time.

740
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,780
But I can't leave.

741
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,570
No, not for a while.

742
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,490
You'll be under observation.

743
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:01,620
I'm not crazy. You know I'm not crazy.

744
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:06,540
In my opinion, you are a victim
of circumstance and biology.

745
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:10,050
Isn't your opinion the one that counts?

746
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:12,260
No, I'm just one doctor.

747
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,050
It may help to have you examined
by another psychiatrist.

748
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,970
We should get Dr. Siebert.

749
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:19,140
She's known me for a lot longer,
and she could testify.

750
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:22,980
Dr. Siebert's records
have already been submitted to the D.A.

751
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:26,020
And you weren't in her care
at the time of the murder.

752
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:31,820
But if I'm just a victim
of circumstance and biology...

753
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:36,200
It was the Ablixa.
You told me I should stay

754
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,410
on the Ablixa.
I would never be here if it weren't for that.

755
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:43,500
Emily, if you take this plea,
as soon as a psychiatrist says you're ready,

756
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,120
we'll apply for your release.

757
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,170
What if I say no?

758
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,670
Then we keep going.

759
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:54,340
But they have a body,
they have your prints on the murder weapon,

760
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:55,760
and they have you at the crime scene.

761
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,590
We can't argue
that you didn't do any of that, so,

762
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,850
one day, it goes to the jury
and maybe they acquit,

763
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:03,350
you walk out of here on your own.

764
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:05,350
Or maybe it goes the other way.

765
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,400
Well, what do you think?

766
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,520
I will tell you what I know.

767
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:13,820
An NGRI defense
is only successful 1% of the time,

768
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,360
and they are giving you that today.

769
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,530
<i>You're fucking kidding me.</i>

770
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:21,030
Nobody here has ever had a bad result?
Nobody here has had

771
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,200
a client react to a side effect?

772
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:26,620
Your arrogance here is breathtaking.
You take no responsibility?

773
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:29,130
For her body's reaction to a medicine?

774
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:30,460
It only just came on the market!

775
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,920
She has come up in a number
of my sessions as well.

776
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,710
It's become a part of the environment here.

777
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,840
I have clients who are afraid
to take their medications.

778
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,050
We had the state board here.
It's on the nightly news.

779
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:42,970
Look, I spoke with her lawyer and the D.A.
We worked it out.

780
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:45,020
She's taking an NGRI.

781
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:47,600
She's going to hospital for observation.
It's behind us.

782
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:48,980
It's all gonna go away.

783
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:51,560
Bullshit, Jon! It is splashed all over you!

784
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:54,150
It's going to follow you around forever.

785
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:55,990
And us, too, if we're standing next to you.

786
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:58,990
What does that mean?
If she's not guilty, why am I?

787
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:00,700
Rational people may look at it like that,

788
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,950
but we don't see
a great many rational people here.

789
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,030
You can see what I'm saying?

790
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,080
We shouldn't even have to ask.
You should see what's happening.

791
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,250
But that seems hard for you!

792
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:22,180
Do you think I screwed up?

793
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:24,850
I don't know.

794
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:31,060
I noticed the Taylor woman
in the waiting room.

795
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,650
She was very attractive.

796
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:35,690
A wounded bird. Fragile.

797
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:39,450
Would you have treated her differently
if she was a man?

798
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:40,780
Gene.

799
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:44,120
That's not what happened.

800
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,620
Maybe it's time for you to slow down.

801
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,870
Your client load is down.
Get some cheaper space.

802
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,710
Focus on what's going on with you.

803
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:54,290
Unbelievable.

804
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,550
I received a letter, Jon.

805
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:59,130
I haven't shared it with anyone,

806
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,880
but I think it will likely surface.

807
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,640
What kind of letter?

808
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:09,640
It's about Alison Finn.

809
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,940
<i>It was during my residency.</i>

810
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,860
There was a walk-in clinic at the university.

811
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:19,320
I saw her maybe three times.

812
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,900
She saw other people there as well,

813
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:25,240
called the suicide line every other night.

814
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,410
She was a paranoid schizophrenic

815
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:30,660
and a drug addict. Very sick girl.

816
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,120
She knew where you lived.

817
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,210
She stalked me.

818
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:35,880
The letter says you took her to London.

819
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,670
Never.

820
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:39,840
Why are they writing this?

821
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,920
Their daughter committed suicide

822
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:44,930
and left a very graphic note, naming me.

823
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:48,680
It never happened. Look.

824
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:52,850
It's not unusual for there to be
emotional transference between

825
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,770
a patient and a therapist.

826
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:57,770
Had her perform oral sex in your car?

827
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:00,570
Never! It was a fantasy!

828
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:57,540
<i>Depression can
take away your energy.</i>

829
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:02,050
<i>It can steal away your time.</i>

830
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:51,930
<i>A number of years ago,</i>

831
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:53,760
<i>I had a patient who was having an affair.</i>

832
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:56,810
Came in here every week
like he was going to confession.

833
00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:59,900
Cried, repented. Didn't stop.

834
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,320
Then one day, he comes in and says it's over.

835
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:08,740
He's finally got a handle on his issues,
like some great epiphany.

836
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:12,870
It was about six or seven months later

837
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:17,790
his wife turns up and says he has a whole
other family in another state.

838
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:21,040
He'd been lying to her.

839
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:23,500
And he was lying to me.

840
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,340
The kids blamed me. The wife blamed me.
Even the patient blamed me.

841
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,430
At times, I blamed me.

842
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:39,190
The point is the cardiologist
can see it coming, the heart attack,

843
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:42,520
from the tests. It's in the blood.

844
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,940
But who can see the lies?

845
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:49,110
Or the past, or the sadness?

846
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:56,450
You didn't tell me you wrote the article.

847
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:01,290
We were consulting on a patient,
not comparing resumes.

848
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:04,000
It would have been a little self-involved

849
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,590
for me to mention it, don't you think?

850
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,880
It wasn't about me, it was about Emily.

851
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,470
Why didn't you tell me
about the sleepwalking?

852
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,140
Me tell you?

853
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,060
She told you about them.

854
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:18,560
And you kept her on the Ablixa.

855
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,810
It was a decision you made, Jon.

856
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:24,190
How did you know that?

857
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:25,230
Know what?

858
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:31,990
That she had more than one episode.
How would you know that?

859
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:36,580
Did she have them
when she was your patient?

860
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:39,160
I know because it's in the news.

861
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:41,500
That's how I know.

862
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:44,250
Everyone knows.

863
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,840
Everyone knows everything, Jon.

864
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,560
Like that? At that speed?

865
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,770
- No, faster than that.
- Oh, faster than that.

866
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:06,230
Yeah, and she was carrying the seat belt.

867
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:07,860
She was wearing the seat belt? Are you sure?

868
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:09,190
Yeah, I saw it!

869
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:16,870
<i>One moment, you're living high
on the hog, and the next moment,</i>

870
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:20,290
you're visiting your hubby in jail,
eating ramen?

871
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:22,460
Who wouldn't be depressed?

872
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:24,870
And then what happened...

873
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:28,380
Oh, God, it's just so tragic.

874
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:33,300
I've suffered from my own depression,
so I understand.

875
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:35,300
I'm sorry to hear that.

876
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:41,720
"Every afternoon, around 3:00,
like a poisonous fog bank rolling in

877
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,390
"on my mind, and I'm paralyzed. "

878
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,980
"A poisonous fog"?

879
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,360
- That's not me. It's William Styron. Yes.
- William Styron.

880
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,150
<i>- Darkness Visible.
- Darkness Visible.</i>

881
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:53,900
<i>There are times when
I feel I could have written it, but...</i>

882
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:56,660
<i>So is she</i>

883
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:58,570
doing any better?

884
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,410
I'm keeping an eye on her.

885
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:18,180
Excuse me. Are you Julia?

886
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:21,260
Julia? Are you Julia?

887
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:26,350
Sorry to disturb you. Are you Julia? No.

888
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,190
Julia? Are you Julia?

889
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:29,810
- No, I'm Joan.
- Julia.

890
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:32,020
- Is there a... Are you Julia?
- No, I'm Susan.

891
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:33,320
Is there something else?

892
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,200
I wanted to speak to her friend, Julia.

893
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:40,280
Julia? I don't think
we have a Julia that works here.

894
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:41,910
Really?

895
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:45,040
Hey.

896
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,620
Look at this.

897
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:52,340
She knew all about airbags and seat belts.
Fucking commercial runs

898
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,380
on a loop in the lobby where she works.

899
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,010
Where were you?
- What?

900
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:03,140
You forgot me at school.

901
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,640
I was here. I was doing this.

902
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:08,270
Honey, go to your room.
Start your homework. I'll be there in a minute.

903
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:09,850
I'm sorry.

904
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:14,570
What is all this? The Delatrex thing?

905
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:16,610
No, look, I went to her office.

906
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:19,610
There is no Julia at work who takes Ablixa.

907
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:22,620
What are you talking about?

908
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,870
Why did she make up Julia?

909
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,830
I don't know. Isn't she sick?

910
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,670
I thought sick people
sometimes make things up.

911
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:38,380
<i>So you're feeling better.</i>

912
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:42,180
<i>Yeah, much better.
I've been doing a lot of, um,</i>

913
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:46,270
running on the treadmill here to try
and get in shape and stimulate serotonin.

914
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:49,440
You're not feeling
like you're in a "poisonous fog"?

915
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:51,440
No.

916
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:53,610
No, not so much anymore.

917
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:57,820
That phrase really stuck with me.

918
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:00,360
How did you come by it?

919
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:04,990
I don't know, really. Um...

920
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:07,580
I guess it's just...

921
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:10,620
I guess that's how I felt back then.

922
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:13,420
You know, maybe I heard it
or read it somewhere.

923
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:19,050
Back on the boat with Martin,
we used to always see the fog rolling in.

924
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:22,970
I'm sure a lot of depressed people
have felt that way before.

925
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,470
The important thing is that I think
the fog is finally lifting.

926
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:32,730
And I really think I'm going to be ready
to get out of here soon.

927
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:40,440
I have to go, I'm sorry.
I have a meeting in the city.

928
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:46,490
Do you think maybe, uh,
next time you could stay a little longer?

929
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:50,160
It's just I don't have any other visitors

930
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:53,920
and this is really all I have to look forward to.

931
01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:57,840
What about your friend, Julia?

932
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,010
Julia?

933
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:04,010
Yes. From the ad agency.

934
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:08,680
Oh, Julia. No, I worked with Julia at the bar.

935
01:06:09,350 --> 01:06:13,190
I haven't heard from her
since everything happened.

936
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:16,520
I haven't heard from most people.

937
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:22,190
Are you okay?

938
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:30,540
I know what it's like to have your
entire life change out from under you.

939
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:37,040
The only difference is,
you didn't do anything wrong and Martin did.

940
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,670
<i>So, the reason I called.</i>

941
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:43,220
I mean, with all the attention in the paper
on the Taylor case,

942
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,340
and with the ethics probe and such,

943
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:48,050
I wanted to tell you that, um...

944
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:51,850
We need to ask you to step off the study.

945
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:53,560
I'm sure it's all blown out of proportion,

946
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,730
but we can't have you on the payroll now.

947
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:57,730
I could be anonymous.

948
01:06:58,230 --> 01:06:59,900
Still do the work.

949
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:02,570
I'm real sorry.

950
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:05,320
I feel horrible about this.

951
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:11,080
Maybe you can be part of another study
when this is over.

952
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:12,750
All right, then.

953
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:15,460
The funny thing is,
with Sadler-Benelux in the toilet,

954
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:17,080
we're up like 30%.

955
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,500
What?

956
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:23,050
The guys down on Wall Street are cashing in
because of what happened with Ablixa.

957
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:25,260
Worked out super well for us.

958
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:27,340
<i>You can bet on a stock to go down,</i>

959
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:29,800
<i>just like you can bet on it to go up.</i>

960
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:31,760
A few days before 9/11,

961
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:36,600
there was a huge surge
in the purchase of options of airline stock.

962
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:39,230
No one knows why. It's a complete mystery.

963
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:42,480
But United fell 40% after the planes crashed

964
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:44,400
and people made a lot of money.

965
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,650
And it isn't illegal.

966
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:48,240
Thinking something's
going to happen isn't illegal.

967
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,740
Breaking the law to make it happen
is a different story.

968
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:53,950
Jon, I know what insider trading is.
I used to work in finance.

969
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,250
Sure, you do, but, look. See!

970
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:00,380
Hey. See what happened at Sadler-Benelux

971
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:02,130
right after Martin Taylor died.

972
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:04,210
Down. Way down.

973
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:08,720
AziLyle, on the other hand... up. Way up.

974
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:11,930
She did it. She made it happen, do you see?

975
01:08:11,970 --> 01:08:13,470
Do you see? Ablixa was her idea!

976
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,560
But you prescribed it. You did that.

977
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:22,060
I got a job today.

978
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,150
- Huh?
- They offered me full time.

979
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,450
I left you a message this morning.

980
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:31,240
I didn't hear.
My phone was off 'cause I was at the hospital.

981
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,660
Hopefully with this and the consulting
money we can finally get back...

982
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:37,410
No, the Delatrex thing is over. It's gone.

983
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:40,080
They fired me.

984
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,420
What?

985
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:45,090
- When?
- Today.

986
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:49,430
That's why I have
to make this thing with Emily work.

987
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:52,340
I'm not letting another Alison Finn happen,

988
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:53,470
so I'm fucking fighting this time!

989
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:55,470
I don't want to hear about Emily or Alison.

990
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:57,020
But this is starting to make sense now!

991
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,020
No, it's not making sense!

992
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:03,520
It doesn't make sense that you're
sitting here doing this all day long!

993
01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:05,440
The case is over.

994
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,200
The photographers are gone,
your partners are gone,

995
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,780
the Delatrex thing is now gone.

996
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:16,370
You're the only one that's still here.

997
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:18,790
I just want to know what happened.

998
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:22,630
A woman you were treating
killed her husband.

999
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,800
That's what happened.

1000
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,220
<i>But I already told the truth.</i>

1001
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:36,180
That's what this test
will help to prove.

1002
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,810
How does it do that?

1003
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:40,730
It helps to show your true state of mind.

1004
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:44,810
Sodium amytal gives us a window
into someone's psyche.

1005
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:46,360
It lowers inhibitions.

1006
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:50,110
We make a video of the test
and we show it to the judge.

1007
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:54,570
It's just you know how I feel about drugs.

1008
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:57,580
Emily, this is the fastest way out of here.

1009
01:09:58,830 --> 01:10:00,750
What does it do to me?

1010
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:03,580
Initially, you'll feel light-headed.

1011
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:08,500
And then you will get a sense
of well-being. Calm.

1012
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:12,590
After a few minutes,
you'll probably get drowsy and fall asleep.

1013
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,390
What do you do while that's happening?

1014
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:15,930
I ask questions.

1015
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:19,680
You answer. You say whatever you feel
about what happened.

1016
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:22,730
What motivated you to come
and see me in the first place?

1017
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:25,190
My motivation was to
get over my depression

1018
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:26,940
and to have a life with my husband.

1019
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:28,940
Then that's what this will show.

1020
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:31,110
What if I say something else?

1021
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:34,610
What do you mean?

1022
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:39,450
I just mean, what if I say something
that makes my situation worse?

1023
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:45,460
You say anything you're not happy with,
I'll destroy the video.

1024
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,760
How old are you, Emily?

1025
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,300
Twenty-eight.

1026
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:56,760
Where are we?

1027
01:10:57,550 --> 01:11:02,220
Wards Island Psychiatric Forensic Center.

1028
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:06,730
What is the capital of New York?

1029
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,900
Albany.

1030
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:13,440
Do you know why you're here?

1031
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:17,240
Because my husband is dead.

1032
01:11:17,570 --> 01:11:19,240
How did he die?

1033
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:23,910
They said I stabbed him, but I can't remember.

1034
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:28,000
Did you want him dead?
Did you kill Martin on purpose?

1035
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,210
No.

1036
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:34,760
I wanted us to sail away together
on the boat, all three of us.

1037
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:37,590
The three of you?

1038
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:40,180
Madeleine.

1039
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,680
What happened to Madeleine?

1040
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:46,100
I lost her because I was sad

1041
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:50,020
and she didn't want to stay inside
a sad person anymore.

1042
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:56,610
He gave me so much
and then they took him away.

1043
01:11:56,950 --> 01:11:59,280
I wanted to give him a daughter.

1044
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:03,490
But you killed him.

1045
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,210
Were you angry with him? Did you hate him?

1046
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:11,090
No. I never would have hurt him.
I loved everything about him.

1047
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:13,380
The way he smelled,

1048
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,670
his hands. Everything about him, I loved.

1049
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:18,720
Did you do it for the money?

1050
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,300
Like he did?

1051
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:24,470
Emily.

1052
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:28,230
I loved everything about him.

1053
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:31,060
<i>Emily, can you hear me?</i>

1054
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:32,150
<i>I can't remember.</i>

1055
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:33,570
That's what she said in her statement.

1056
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:34,650
She doesn't remember.

1057
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:35,820
She's lying.

1058
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:37,650
What does her falling asleep prove?

1059
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:39,780
You have to destroy this.
You're torturing the poor woman.

1060
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:49,830
It's saline.

1061
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:53,250
I gave her saltwater.

1062
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:54,380
What?

1063
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:55,880
There was no drug.

1064
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:58,670
So, why did she pass out?

1065
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:02,800
You don't put in a performance like that
on saltwater.

1066
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:06,430
Call the hospital. Order a blood test.

1067
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:09,520
You won't find any amytal in her system.

1068
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:12,770
She's been lying this whole time.

1069
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:23,370
Destroy that.

1070
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:26,080
No. Call the hospital.

1071
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:28,200
- Order a blood test.
- Not a chance.

1072
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:30,710
- We have her. Arrest her.
- Dr. Banks...

1073
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:32,080
I want my life back!

1074
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,460
Destroy it before it destroys you.

1075
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:36,130
She knew the safety features of the car...

1076
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:38,340
You don't want to say that to me or to anyone.

1077
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:40,630
- Another thing. Sadler-Benelux is down.
- Stop talking, Dr. Banks.

1078
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:42,130
- Stop! It's too late!
- Millions of dollars were made!

1079
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:44,970
No! You could have worked with us! I asked.

1080
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:48,390
The verdict's in. It's too fucking late
for whatever that circus is

1081
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:49,480
that you just showed me.

1082
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,690
You see, we can't just start over.

1083
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:53,940
We have double jeopardy laws in this country.

1084
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:55,650
Check her bank account.

1085
01:13:55,730 --> 01:13:58,570
We did. We always do. Nothing.

1086
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:02,450
No insurance policy, no stock holdings,
no inheritance from Martin.

1087
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:03,490
She's not depressed.

1088
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:05,740
And you didn't catch it and someone died.

1089
01:14:07,490 --> 01:14:10,830
And I didn't catch it
and someone didn't go to jail.

1090
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:12,250
We failed.

1091
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:16,170
See, that's what your little stunt proves.
If it proves anything,

1092
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:18,250
it proves we got beat.

1093
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:21,010
And that you lied to a woman

1094
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:24,220
who's not guilty about what
you were putting in her arm.

1095
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:26,680
Now, I don't know how you feel about that,

1096
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,180
but I would rather it
stay between you and me.

1097
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:32,850
You were never here.

1098
01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:35,020
<i>Just come out there</i>

1099
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:38,190
and see her once. Please.

1100
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:40,070
She wasn't depressed.

1101
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,320
I actually can prove it.

1102
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,160
Why would I examine her now?

1103
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,700
Is that what you wanted
to see me about? Shit, Jon!

1104
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:49,660
I solved it finally, on my own.
Just come see her.

1105
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:51,540
You're stuck in some old place, Jon.

1106
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:53,210
I think you need someone
to help pull you out.

1107
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:56,170
I can refer someone good.
Are you still seeing her?

1108
01:14:56,210 --> 01:14:58,340
I'm consulting. I'm her expert on this case.

1109
01:14:58,380 --> 01:14:59,840
Well, that has to stop!

1110
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:03,050
You want to make it go away, you go out to
Wards Island and resign from the case.

1111
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:04,180
- Step off.
- I can't do that.

1112
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:06,390
Well, then it's not going to go away.

1113
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:09,010
- Okay, you won't come and see her with me?
- No.

1114
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:10,470
- Can I ask you something else?
- What?

1115
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,640
Some Adderall.
Just a short term, 20 milligrams.

1116
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:16,980
- That's why you called, isn't it?
- I'm struggling

1117
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:20,570
to hold focus here, Gene.
That's what it's for, to help people focus.

1118
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:21,730
You want to focus on something,

1119
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:23,570
focus on never seeing her again.

1120
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:30,200
<i>D, I've been thinking
about what you said.</i>

1121
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:33,620
Look, you're right. It's time to move on.

1122
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:36,120
I'm heading over to Wards Island right now.

1123
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:38,420
<i>I'm not gonna see her again.</i>

1124
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:00,940
You went to see Emily.

1125
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:02,650
Damn right, I did.

1126
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:05,150
You could have called me first.

1127
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:06,610
She called me.

1128
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:08,410
She was very upset.

1129
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:11,080
It was kind of a dramatic stunt
to pull on a woman

1130
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:14,250
who's already in a great deal
of emotional pain.

1131
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:17,460
I don't understand your thinking.

1132
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,630
I'm trying to determine her state of mind

1133
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:25,720
so I can chart the best course of treatment.

1134
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,170
"Treatment"?

1135
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,840
You gave an amytal interview to a woman

1136
01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:32,140
who's been declared not guilty.

1137
01:16:32,810 --> 01:16:34,470
I hope you learned something.

1138
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:35,850
Oh, I did.

1139
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,310
Quite a lot, actually.

1140
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:42,900
I think she requires more observation.

1141
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:44,650
And she'll need more medication as well.

1142
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:07,130
This is Dr. Siebert on Bridge Street.

1143
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:10,180
I'd like an envelope delivered to Manhattan.

1144
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:18,020
Hey.

1145
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:23,650
Where's the little guy?

1146
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:26,360
Fuck!

1147
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:28,530
I'm not going to go to the police,

1148
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,610
or whomever one goes to in this situation.

1149
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:32,820
I'm just going to go away.

1150
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:35,830
What? Wait! Hey, wait!

1151
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:37,040
Wait?

1152
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:40,410
Wait for this to happen again?

1153
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:43,380
Another Alison or Emily?

1154
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,380
Oh, wow. See?

1155
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:50,380
Okay, these prove everything.

1156
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:52,090
She took these.

1157
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:56,260
These were sent by a friend
of the husband's.

1158
01:17:56,350 --> 01:17:57,390
No, that's not true.

1159
01:17:57,470 --> 01:17:59,140
Stay away from us.

1160
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:01,640
Wait! Dierdre!

1161
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:06,020
Dierdre. Dierdre, wait a minute.

1162
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:08,230
- No, Jon.
- Wait a minute. Hello, love.

1163
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:24,330
<i>You have two unheard messages.</i>

1164
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:25,670
<i>First unheard message.</i>

1165
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:28,750
<i>Yes, Dr. Banks?
This is Jeffrey Childs</i>

1166
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,590
<i>from the Office of Medical Conduct Review.</i>

1167
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:35,720
<i>I have some questions about Alison Finn.
Can you call me at...</i>

1168
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:38,260
<i>Deleted.</i>

1169
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:41,930
<i>This is Dr. Siebert.</i>

1170
01:18:42,270 --> 01:18:44,850
<i>I'm sure you've received my latest notes</i>

1171
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:47,270
<i>concerning the Emily Taylor case by now.</i>

1172
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:49,900
<i>There is, I think you'll agree,</i>

1173
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:52,110
<i>a different course of treatment to pursue</i>

1174
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:55,700
<i>that is in everyone's best interest.</i>

1175
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:58,450
<i>Maybe we can meet for a coffee? Thanks.</i>

1176
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:01,500
<i>Saved. End of new messages.</i>

1177
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:04,620
<i>Check erased messages. Press 1-9.</i>

1178
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:08,630
<i>You could get
national coverage on this.</i>

1179
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,300
"Shrinks fucking patients

1180
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:14,550
"and manipulating them
into killing their spouses. "

1181
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:16,010
Hot stuff.

1182
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:20,220
I would say this would ruin your practice.

1183
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:22,060
But wait.

1184
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:24,310
You don't have a practice anymore

1185
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:28,690
or a wife or a kid, I'm betting.

1186
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:32,490
So what else can you lose?

1187
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:36,660
Martha can certainly use those
in a wrongful death suit.

1188
01:19:37,570 --> 01:19:39,410
State revoke your license, yet?

1189
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:44,000
I always tell my patients,

1190
01:19:44,330 --> 01:19:47,000
"You know what the best predictor
of future behavior is?

1191
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,420
"Past behavior. "

1192
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:52,170
Well, you don't have any more patients.

1193
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:56,010
The only problem with having
a crazy person for a partner

1194
01:19:56,050 --> 01:19:57,840
is they tend to stay crazy.

1195
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:00,050
You should know how difficult it is

1196
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:02,600
to cure a pretty girl with daddy issues.

1197
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:05,680
Nice try, Jon. I'm not buying it.

1198
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:08,350
Spend the fucking money now.

1199
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,690
Because they're coming to take it back.

1200
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:16,030
What are you talking about?

1201
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,860
You could go and ask her.

1202
01:20:19,370 --> 01:20:21,780
Only she asked me
to keep you from seeing her.

1203
01:20:23,370 --> 01:20:24,700
She told me everything.

1204
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:34,210
Everything? No, I'll tell you everything.

1205
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:36,720
You wouldn't be here
if you had nothing to lose.

1206
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:40,140
She already got a "not guilty" verdict.
You, on the other hand...

1207
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:42,970
Fuck you! You get her out of there
right now, you hear me?

1208
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:46,230
You do that and you won't hear
from either one of us again.

1209
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,310
Yeah, you can go back to chatting with

1210
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:50,480
rich white people about their problems.

1211
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:53,650
She's cured, as of right now, Jon.

1212
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,740
You're a fucking genius!

1213
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:04,330
<i>She's been very agitated lately.</i>

1214
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:07,250
I think it best we restrict her visitors.

1215
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:11,080
And no phone calls, either,
without notifying me first.

1216
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:13,670
She's been resisting
her medication as well.

1217
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:16,210
Very confrontational with the staff.

1218
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:18,090
She seems to be getting worse.

1219
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:19,930
Mmm. I was afraid of that.

1220
01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:25,600
That's a mouth guard.

1221
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:29,440
It stops her smashing her teeth,
biting her tongue off.

1222
01:21:29,690 --> 01:21:32,440
The current lasts for about five seconds.

1223
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,480
They'll have administered a paralytic agent,

1224
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:38,530
but they put a tourniquet
on the ankle, you see?

1225
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:41,110
To make sure she is having a seizure.

1226
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,200
Keep your eye on that foot.

1227
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:48,500
It's actually been shown
to be remarkably effective

1228
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:49,790
for treating severe depression.

1229
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:52,290
None of the side effects you get with pills.

1230
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:55,380
No idea what it might do to a normal person.

1231
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,420
I also wanted to give you another test.

1232
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:01,970
A personality inventory.
Just a series of true-or-false questions.

1233
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:03,800
<i>First saved voice message.</i>

1234
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:05,760
<i>This is Dr. Siebert.</i>

1235
01:22:05,810 --> 01:22:08,180
<i>I'm sure you've received my latest notes</i>

1236
01:22:08,270 --> 01:22:10,480
<i>concerning the Emily Taylor case by now.</i>

1237
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,810
Not a very subtle tool,

1238
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:13,560
but the results will be of interest to the board.

1239
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:15,610
<i>...a different course of treatment to pursue</i>

1240
01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:16,730
<i>that is in everyone's best interest.</i>

1241
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:18,980
They like hard data to look at.

1242
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:21,820
Wait. What is she saying?

1243
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:23,820
Who?

1244
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:31,330
I don't think you should be
my doctor anymore.

1245
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:33,500
I think you should resign my case.

1246
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:39,670
Victoria's paying me way too much for that.

1247
01:22:40,510 --> 01:22:43,180
Out of your share, I assume.

1248
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:47,430
The shock treatment was her idea.
It damages the memory.

1249
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:52,520
It's in our best interest
that you start forgetting.

1250
01:22:54,690 --> 01:22:56,940
Are you ready for your treatment, Ms. Taylor?

1251
01:23:01,530 --> 01:23:03,860
Oh, no, I scheduled it for tomorrow.

1252
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:15,790
I need to use the phone.

1253
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:17,880
You can be next.

1254
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:24,720
I need to call my lawyer now.

1255
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:28,050
Are you going to be long?

1256
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:29,720
You going to be long?
I need to use the phone.

1257
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:34,390
Are you going to be long?
Isn't there a time limit?

1258
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,560
I need to call someone.
My shrink is fucking with me.

1259
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:38,730
Can you get off now?

1260
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:41,480
I'm sorry, Mrs. Taylor. You've been restricted.

1261
01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:43,740
By who? By Dr. Banks?

1262
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:47,490
He's not my doctor anymore.
He attacked me. He's sick.

1263
01:23:47,910 --> 01:23:49,620
Miss Taylor, you need to step back.

1264
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:52,830
Get off the phone. Get off the phone!

1265
01:23:52,910 --> 01:23:55,750
Miss Taylor, you need to relax.

1266
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,590
Get me Dr. Siebert! This is bullshit!

1267
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:04,800
I shouldn't even be here! I'm not sick!
Get me Dr. Siebert! No! No!

1268
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,590
Relax! Relax!

1269
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:09,260
No, I don't want it! I don't want it!

1270
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:12,260
Yes. Dr. Siebert?

1271
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:14,270
Dr. Banks.

1272
01:24:15,770 --> 01:24:17,850
I've been thinking about
our last conversation.

1273
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:20,610
Yes.

1274
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,780
An idea occurred to me.

1275
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:25,530
Mmm-hmm.

1276
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:27,530
Maybe I am a genius.

1277
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,510
Hello there! Best we don't talk inside, right?

1278
01:24:45,630 --> 01:24:47,010
Talk about what?

1279
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:49,970
Uh, she wants to go
before the judge this week.

1280
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:51,970
And what is she going to say?

1281
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:53,970
Well, it depends.

1282
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:57,230
She could tell a long,
sordid story about her former shrink.

1283
01:24:57,890 --> 01:25:00,020
Suggest the SEC investigate. The whole story.

1284
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:02,310
That would make national coverage,
wouldn't it?

1285
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:05,900
- And what do you get out of it?
- Oh, I don't know.

1286
01:25:06,650 --> 01:25:10,820
Peace of mind. Like I said, it depends.

1287
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:18,410
No.

1288
01:25:19,830 --> 01:25:21,330
No, no.

1289
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:26,590
This will be the last time we speak. Okay?

1290
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:32,340
You get her released,
and we go back to being strangers.

1291
01:25:33,930 --> 01:25:37,270
Unless, of course,
you want to consult on other patients.

1292
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:44,020
No.

1293
01:26:40,910 --> 01:26:43,750
The staff told me
you were having a difficult time.

1294
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:49,760
So, I've added medication that will help.

1295
01:27:00,430 --> 01:27:03,350
If I tell you the truth,
do I have to take the pills?

1296
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:09,940
I won't be able to tell the truth
if I take any more pills.

1297
01:28:42,790 --> 01:28:44,700
<i>Imagine everything
you ever wanted</i>

1298
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:47,210
<i>shows up one day and calls itself your life.</i>

1299
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:51,790
<i>And then, just when you start to believe in it...</i>

1300
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,550
<i>Gone. And suddenly, it gets</i>

1301
01:28:55,590 --> 01:28:58,340
<i>very hard to imagine a future.</i>

1302
01:28:58,970 --> 01:29:01,140
<i>That's depression, right?</i>

1303
01:29:13,650 --> 01:29:15,900
<i>So I went to see Dr. Siebert.</i>

1304
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:19,110
<i>We talked about my childhood.</i>

1305
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:22,160
<i>About disappointment
and Mommy and Daddy.</i>

1306
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:24,910
<i>And I told her about Martin.</i>

1307
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:27,660
<i>And she told me
that her marriage with her husband</i>

1308
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:30,120
<i>had never been anything
but a meeting of minds.</i>

1309
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:33,920
<i>And minds start to wander after a while.</i>

1310
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:38,260
<i>He had traded her in
for a younger model, so she was</i>

1311
01:29:38,590 --> 01:29:41,760
<i>alone and lonely. It didn't take much.</i>

1312
01:29:43,930 --> 01:29:46,270
<i>I think she always liked girls,</i>

1313
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:48,930
<i>she just never found one
she liked as much as me.</i>

1314
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:54,270
<i>She taught me how to be depressed.</i>

1315
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:58,110
<i>What drugs had which side effects.</i>

1316
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:01,610
<i>What symptoms went with what diagnosis.</i>

1317
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:04,030
<i>And I taught her everything Martin</i>

1318
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:06,870
<i>ever told me about derivatives and deals.</i>

1319
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:10,620
<i>The trades were in her name.
So I forgave Martin.</i>

1320
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:13,170
<i>I went to visit on the weekends</i>

1321
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:15,630
<i>and told him that I would wait for him.</i>

1322
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,480
<i>What do you doctors call faking?</i>

1323
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:35,770
<i>"Malingering"?</i>

1324
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:38,650
<i>Such a funny word.</i>

1325
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:42,860
<i>Girls learn to fake things at a very early age.</i>

1326
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:46,410
<i>Probably around the same time
that boys are learning to lie.</i>

1327
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:55,670
<i>We needed everyone to see
how much I wanted it to work out with us.</i>

1328
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:57,750
<i>How much I loved my husband.</i>

1329
01:30:58,340 --> 01:31:01,010
<i>And how terribly depressed I was.</i>

1330
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:06,350
<i>When did you decide to kill him?</i>

1331
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:09,350
<i>It's not a decision you make just once.</i>

1332
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:12,310
<i>You make it over and over again,</i>

1333
01:31:12,350 --> 01:31:14,730
<i>every time you look at your life</i>

1334
01:31:14,810 --> 01:31:17,980
<i>and you see the position you're in
and who put you there.</i>

1335
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:19,860
<i>And it all leads back to him.</i>

1336
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:23,200
<i>Each and every fucking problem,
every disappointment.</i>

1337
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:25,910
<i>And you think to yourself,</i>

1338
01:31:25,990 --> 01:31:30,040
<i>"Maybe if he just goes away,
it'll all get better. "</i>

1339
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:48,680
<i>Everything would have worked out perfectly</i>

1340
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:51,220
<i>if you had just disappeared after the trial</i>

1341
01:31:51,890 --> 01:31:53,730
<i>like you were supposed to.</i>

1342
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:55,440
<i>Why me?</i>

1343
01:31:56,150 --> 01:31:58,310
Was it because of Alison Finn?

1344
01:31:59,570 --> 01:32:03,240
That was just a happy coincidence.

1345
01:32:03,650 --> 01:32:05,910
A convenient distraction.

1346
01:32:06,570 --> 01:32:07,570
It didn't have to be you.

1347
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:09,200
It could have been you or anyone else

1348
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,330
who walked into my room
with a prescription pad.

1349
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:15,460
We didn't go looking for you,
we just looked at the world.

1350
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:24,380
<i>I read somewhere that there's a difference</i>

1351
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:26,550
<i>between tears of joy and tears of rage.</i>

1352
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:28,010
<i>Is that true?</i>

1353
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:30,930
<i>It's in the chemistry,
but you can't tell by looking</i>

1354
01:32:30,970 --> 01:32:33,430
<i>they all just look like tears.</i>

1355
01:32:43,530 --> 01:32:47,200
Hello? Hello, I think I need help! I think my...

1356
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:51,200
My husband's bleeding and I think he's...
I think he's been stabbed

1357
01:32:51,450 --> 01:32:55,040
and he's dead. He's dead, I think he's dead.

1358
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:58,370
I think he's dead! You need to send someone!

1359
01:32:58,710 --> 01:33:00,040
Please!

1360
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:11,720
You never did take the Paxil, did you?

1361
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:14,220
No.

1362
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:15,810
Or the Zoloft.

1363
01:33:16,230 --> 01:33:17,390
No.

1364
01:33:17,730 --> 01:33:19,400
Only the Ablixa.

1365
01:33:20,190 --> 01:33:22,360
Didn't really do anything for me.

1366
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:28,490
So, when did she start paying you?

1367
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:39,420
She always knew you'd turn on her someday

1368
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:44,750
like you did with Martin.

1369
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:50,840
Past behavior is the best predictor
of future behavior.

1370
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:54,180
That's what she said about you.

1371
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:59,690
And how long do you two
plan on keeping me here?

1372
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:07,690
Why would we ever let you leave?

1373
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:11,110
Because

1374
01:34:12,620 --> 01:34:14,780
maybe there's a better deal.

1375
01:34:26,210 --> 01:34:29,720
<i>Over the course of her confinement,
I've come to the conclusion</i>

1376
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,510
<i>with a reasonable degree of medical certainty</i>

1377
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:36,640
<i>that Emily Taylor
is neither mentally ill or dangerous</i>

1378
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:41,060
at this time.
I believe with the proper treatment

1379
01:34:41,270 --> 01:34:45,440
she is not a threat to herself or others.

1380
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:48,030
In my opinion, she's ready to move onto

1381
01:34:48,070 --> 01:34:50,070
the next phase of rehabilitation

1382
01:34:50,150 --> 01:34:52,280
with ongoing supervision, as outlined

1383
01:34:52,910 --> 01:34:55,910
in the outpatient order of conditions.

1384
01:34:56,580 --> 01:35:01,080
The risk of relapse back into
a dangerous mental state is low.

1385
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:06,170
I've submitted to the court
the conditions under which I believe

1386
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:09,960
the order of confinement may be rescinded.

1387
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:13,760
And do you, Ms. Taylor, understand

1388
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:16,550
that if you violate the terms of your release,

1389
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:19,430
I will have to issue
a new order of confinement?

1390
01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:20,930
Yes, Your Honor.

1391
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:47,130
I text her like 20 times a day.

1392
01:35:47,670 --> 01:35:50,800
Zach, you're beginning
to see a pattern, right?

1393
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:55,470
Everyone leaves. It's not a pattern, it's a fact.

1394
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:58,680
And how does this connect
to you being adopted?

1395
01:35:58,970 --> 01:36:00,770
I think it started there.

1396
01:36:01,310 --> 01:36:03,060
And now I'm making it happen.

1397
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:05,940
You know, I get scared that people
will leave and then

1398
01:36:06,810 --> 01:36:11,440
I, uh,
end up making them leave.

1399
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:14,240
Excuse me, Dr. Siebert,
I think someone wants you.

1400
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:21,990
Uh, I'm sorry, Zach, this is an emergency.

1401
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:24,460
We're gonna have to pick this up next time.

1402
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:26,330
You didn't tell Banks anything, did you?

1403
01:36:26,370 --> 01:36:28,040
Of course not.

1404
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,670
How much did you have to pay him
to get me out?

1405
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,170
It doesn't matter. You're out. It's taken care of.

1406
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:37,760
You didn't leave me much choice.

1407
01:36:38,470 --> 01:36:40,970
What did you do with the rest of the money?

1408
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:42,850
Two accounts.

1409
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:45,850
Mine's in Dubai, yours is in Grand Cayman.

1410
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,360
God.

1411
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:54,940
Are you sure
you didn't tell him anything else?

1412
01:36:55,030 --> 01:36:56,360
Yes, I'm sure.

1413
01:36:56,450 --> 01:37:00,780
Because there are SEC violations.
Conspiracy to commit murder.

1414
01:37:01,030 --> 01:37:02,620
I'm exposed here.

1415
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:04,080
Yes, you are.

1416
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:05,750
And I'm vulnerable.

1417
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:11,540
Oh, God, I missed you.

1418
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:19,220
You taught me to be such a sad, sad girl.

1419
01:37:21,050 --> 01:37:23,220
Do I look sad now?

1420
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:29,690
Do you remember the first time?

1421
01:37:29,730 --> 01:37:30,860
Yeah.

1422
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:32,610
Do you remember how wet I made you?

1423
01:37:32,690 --> 01:37:33,690
Oh, yeah.

1424
01:37:33,730 --> 01:37:35,570
Do you want to do that again?

1425
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:37,650
Yeah.

1426
01:37:58,510 --> 01:38:00,340
What the fuck is that?

1427
01:38:00,590 --> 01:38:02,930
You didn't leave me much choice.

1428
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:06,770
Oh, my God.

1429
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:15,110
Dr. Siebert, you're under arrest.

1430
01:38:15,190 --> 01:38:16,730
You're being charged with conspiracy to

1431
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:19,110
commit murder and securities fraud.

1432
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:53,480
...within the next 10 minutes.
I think she's just arrived.

1433
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:55,020
Yeah, she's here.

1434
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:58,230
And thank you.

1435
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:06,660
Here I am. Cured at last.

1436
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:07,740
You're late.

1437
01:39:07,830 --> 01:39:09,250
How long do I have to stay?

1438
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:18,250
I'm going to put you on some medication.

1439
01:39:18,670 --> 01:39:20,170
What?

1440
01:39:20,970 --> 01:39:23,300
This is for Thorazine.

1441
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:26,260
It's a tranquilizer, been around for years.

1442
01:39:26,850 --> 01:39:28,310
You know the people shuffling around

1443
01:39:28,350 --> 01:39:30,980
like zombies
with vacant eyes in the prison ward?

1444
01:39:31,850 --> 01:39:33,020
They were on Thorazine.

1445
01:39:34,190 --> 01:39:36,520
So this is for Depakote.

1446
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:40,030
It'll settle your mood,

1447
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:41,690
but hair loss

1448
01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:43,860
is a side effect.

1449
01:39:47,370 --> 01:39:48,530
What is this?

1450
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:50,700
As part of our arrangement,
I'll also be sending you

1451
01:39:50,790 --> 01:39:52,330
to the Gramercy for urine tests

1452
01:39:52,370 --> 01:39:55,540
to make certain you take your meds.
And I'm seeing you again

1453
01:39:56,210 --> 01:39:58,630
tomorrow, all right? Try not to be late.

1454
01:39:58,710 --> 01:40:00,550
Angry people are frequently late.

1455
01:40:00,590 --> 01:40:01,880
This is bullshit!

1456
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:04,930
You sound angry.
Have you read the court order?

1457
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:07,470
You have to obey the terms of your release.

1458
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:09,390
Yeah, I'm here.

1459
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:13,390
Those terms mandate that if I believe
you are a danger in any way

1460
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:16,400
I need to send you
back to hospital immediately.

1461
01:40:16,730 --> 01:40:19,070
If I don't, I'm in violation of the law.

1462
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:22,690
I got Siebert for you.
I'm a cooperating witness.

1463
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:25,570
- "Very noncompliant... "
- The deal was I testify against her

1464
01:40:25,650 --> 01:40:27,490
- and I get out.
- "... with a history of violence. "

1465
01:40:27,570 --> 01:40:29,450
- This isn't out, this is fucked!
- "Dangerous. "

1466
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:32,200
I think this needs a new diagnosis.

1467
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:34,080
Based on what? What did I do?

1468
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:35,410
To the question,

1469
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:38,170
"There are objects and creatures
all around us only I can see,"

1470
01:40:38,250 --> 01:40:39,380
you answered, "True. "

1471
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:42,050
- You filled that out!
- Schizoaffective disorder.

1472
01:40:42,090 --> 01:40:43,760
I think I need to send you back.

1473
01:40:49,430 --> 01:40:50,930
Mrs. Taylor!

1474
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:56,600
Emily Taylor!

1475
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,270
Miss Taylor, stop!

1476
01:41:04,610 --> 01:41:06,450
Central, we have a 330-20.

1477
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:09,120
No, he's lying! He's lying!

1478
01:41:09,450 --> 01:41:12,660
I'm not sick, I'm not sick!
I promise I'm not sick!

1479
01:41:12,740 --> 01:41:15,830
He's the sick one!
He just wants the money!

1480
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:17,920
No, I'm not sick, I promise!

1481
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:19,960
Don't bring me back,
I don't want to go back!

1482
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:22,920
I don't want to go back!
I don't want to go back!

1483
01:42:38,370 --> 01:42:40,710
How are you doing today, Emily?

1484
01:42:43,670 --> 01:42:45,000
Better.
