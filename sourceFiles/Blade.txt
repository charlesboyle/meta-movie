1
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:04,424
Police found her in the street.
Looks like she was bitten.

2
00:01:04,883 --> 00:01:05,967
Some kind of an animal.

3
00:01:06,426 --> 00:01:07,927
Jesus!
Her water's broken!

4
00:01:08,386 --> 00:01:10,013
She's going into
uterine contractions!

5
00:01:10,472 --> 00:01:12,474
We'll have to do
a C-section!

6
00:02:10,657 --> 00:02:11,783
What you got down there,
little man?

7
00:02:12,242 --> 00:02:13,535
Oh, that's
my heat seeker.

8
00:02:13,993 --> 00:02:15,578
I'll bet this.

9
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:16,621
Aah!

10
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,248
Ha ha ha!

11
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:19,749
So, where are we going?

12
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,501
It's a surprise,
baby.

13
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,253
Yeah, I like surprises.

14
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:26,214
Yeah.

15
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:31,428
Whoo!
Oh, my God!

16
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:34,514
What the fuck
are we doing here?

17
00:02:36,474 --> 00:02:38,518
Whoo! Look at all that.

18
00:02:38,977 --> 00:02:41,271
Ha ha ha!

19
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,648
What the fuck is that?

20
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:50,071
Hey!

21
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:55,618
What did you just say?

22
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:35,533
Wow.

23
00:03:49,798 --> 00:03:51,841
Whoo! Hey, what's up?

24
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,385
Unh! Aan!

25
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:04,270
Whoo!

26
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:06,189
All right.

27
00:04:06,648 --> 00:04:08,400
Ha ha ha!

28
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:14,364
Yeah.

29
00:04:14,823 --> 00:04:16,241
Whoo!

30
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:30,463
Ha ha ha!

31
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:32,757
What's happening?

32
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:34,217
Unh!

33
00:04:39,597 --> 00:04:40,640
Whoa!

34
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:42,767
Aan.

35
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:49,190
Fuck.

36
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:02,370
Fuck. I need a drink.

37
00:05:27,145 --> 00:05:28,730
Ahh!

38
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,461
No! No!

39
00:05:54,923 --> 00:05:56,132
Aah!

40
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:58,968
What's wrong, baby?

41
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:01,930
Aah! Aah!

42
00:06:02,388 --> 00:06:04,182
No! No!

43
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:07,519
Aah! No!

44
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:10,605
Ha ha ha!

45
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:56,317
Is that him?

46
00:06:56,776 --> 00:06:58,194
Jesus, that's him.

47
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:01,448
It's Blade.
It's the daywalker.

48
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:24,679
Come on, daywalker!

49
00:07:34,773 --> 00:07:36,649
Aah!

50
00:07:44,783 --> 00:07:47,327
Hey! I'm gonna rip
your fucking head off!

51
00:07:47,786 --> 00:07:48,787
Unh!

52
00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:05,637
Aah!

53
00:08:32,414 --> 00:08:33,957
Aah!

54
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:44,426
That's him!
That's him! Get him!

55
00:08:44,884 --> 00:08:45,718
Fuck him up!

56
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:48,888
We're gonna jack you up.
Make him hurt bad.

57
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:51,558
Whoo!

58
00:08:54,644 --> 00:08:56,020
Yaah!

59
00:09:36,686 --> 00:09:40,815
Yaah!

60
00:09:54,788 --> 00:09:57,290
Quinn...

61
00:09:57,749 --> 00:10:00,877
I'm getting a little tired
of chopping you up.

62
00:10:05,507 --> 00:10:08,885
Thought I might try fire
for a change.

63
00:10:11,888 --> 00:10:13,807
Give my regards to Frost.

64
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,395
No! Please don't!

65
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:35,120
Put him out.

66
00:10:35,578 --> 00:10:37,580
Yes, sir.
Paramedics.

67
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,481
Got a charred cadaver here
for you. Still warm, too.

68
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,567
1, 2, 3.

69
00:11:10,572 --> 00:11:12,949
Oh, Jesus, that's rank.

70
00:11:13,408 --> 00:11:15,452
Paramedics said
he was still screaming

71
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,289
when they found him
stapled to a wall.

72
00:11:19,748 --> 00:11:21,624
That's very pretty.

73
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,722
Did you check
the chem count?

74
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:37,766
His sugar's
3times norm,

75
00:11:38,224 --> 00:11:39,601
phosphorus and uric acid
are off the charts.

76
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:43,188
You took this
off a D.O. A?

77
00:11:43,646 --> 00:11:45,482
Yeah.

78
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,692
But this doesn't
make any sense.

79
00:11:50,695 --> 00:11:52,197
The red blood cells
are biconvex,

80
00:11:52,655 --> 00:11:53,782
which is impossible.

81
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,494
Look at the polys.
They're binucleated.

82
00:12:00,538 --> 00:12:03,541
OK, Curtis, it's3.00
in the morning...

83
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,001
This is not a joke.

84
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,588
I've got the body sitting
in the morgue right now.

85
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:11,591
I thought you promised
to give me some distance.

86
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,719
I just want you to come down
and take a look.

87
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:24,521
OK. Show me the body.

88
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:27,190
And I don't want to hear
a word about us.

89
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:30,193
Done. We've had
that conversation.

90
00:12:34,072 --> 00:12:35,990
You haven't started on
the internal organs yet?

91
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:39,160
Just a blood sample
through the pericardium.

92
00:12:40,954 --> 00:12:44,040
The maxilla looks
a little deformed.

93
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:46,835
There's some odd muscle
structure around the canines.

94
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:48,253
I'm going
to start the "Y"

95
00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:50,130
and check
the tracheal mucosa.

96
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,096
Let me ask you
something.

97
00:12:58,555 --> 00:13:00,140
Honestly...

98
00:13:00,598 --> 00:13:01,933
you ever have second
thoughts about us?

99
00:13:05,603 --> 00:13:07,021
Sometimes.

100
00:13:09,107 --> 00:13:10,984
But then I remember how much
of an asshole you were.

101
00:13:11,443 --> 00:13:12,527
Want to cut me
some slack here?

102
00:13:12,986 --> 00:13:15,405
You asked for some time off,
I gave you some time off.

103
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:16,448
Look, Curtis...

104
00:13:16,906 --> 00:13:18,032
I'm trying.

105
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:19,492
It's over.

106
00:13:28,501 --> 00:13:31,504
Yaah!

107
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,595
Aah!

108
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:41,014
Call security!

109
00:13:55,487 --> 00:13:56,321
Aah!

110
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,114
Came back
to finish you off.

111
00:13:58,573 --> 00:14:00,617
Get out of my way,
you freak!

112
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,167
Freeze!

113
00:14:10,877 --> 00:14:14,047
Motherfucker, are you
out of your damn mind?!

114
00:14:14,506 --> 00:14:15,507
Aah!
Aah!

115
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:20,053
Yaah!

116
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:26,017
Aah!

117
00:15:06,683 --> 00:15:07,684
Hey, you! Freeze!

118
00:15:18,236 --> 00:15:19,154
Aah!

119
00:15:19,612 --> 00:15:20,196
Aah!

120
00:15:20,655 --> 00:15:22,490
Aah!

121
00:15:26,202 --> 00:15:26,828
Freeze!

122
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:29,164
Hold it right there!

123
00:15:37,756 --> 00:15:39,758
Aah! Aah!

124
00:15:44,554 --> 00:15:45,597
My shoulder.

125
00:15:46,723 --> 00:15:48,266
It's dislocated.

126
00:15:50,977 --> 00:15:52,729
Aah!

127
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:00,570
Uhh!

128
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:38,668
Whistler.

129
00:17:42,046 --> 00:17:43,840
Whistler.

130
00:17:49,888 --> 00:17:51,639
Bringing home
strays now?

131
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:55,393
She's been bitten.

132
00:17:59,898 --> 00:18:01,066
Should've
killed her, then.

133
00:18:01,524 --> 00:18:03,109
Yeah, I know.

134
00:18:05,612 --> 00:18:07,155
But I didn't.

135
00:18:13,995 --> 00:18:15,914
You watch her close.

136
00:18:16,372 --> 00:18:19,167
If she starts to turn,
You finish her off.

137
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:24,714
Or I will.

138
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:28,676
Uhh.

139
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,681
She's border line.

140
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:39,145
Another hour, she'd be
well into the change.

141
00:18:40,772 --> 00:18:42,023
Dr Karen Jenson,

142
00:18:42,482 --> 00:18:44,192
Listen close.

143
00:18:44,651 --> 00:18:46,569
I'm Going to inject you
with allium sativum...

144
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:48,488
garlic.

145
00:18:48,947 --> 00:18:50,824
This is going
to hurt... a lot.

146
00:18:51,282 --> 00:18:53,076
It was Quinn.

147
00:18:53,535 --> 00:18:55,495
Frost's little
errand boy?

148
00:18:55,954 --> 00:18:57,580
You get
a lead on him?

149
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:58,706
No.

150
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:01,751
Too bad.

151
00:19:03,378 --> 00:19:04,003
Uhh!

152
00:19:04,462 --> 00:19:05,505
Hold her.

153
00:19:16,474 --> 00:19:18,435
I give her fifty-fifty

154
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:22,439
if she makes it
through the night.

155
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:49,048
Blade...

156
00:19:49,507 --> 00:19:51,134
the daywalker...

157
00:19:51,593 --> 00:19:54,679
still pursuing
his ridiculous crusade.

158
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,559
How many died?

159
00:20:00,018 --> 00:20:02,062
We don't have
an exact count.

160
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,355
Apparently, he used
a lot of sliver.

161
00:20:04,814 --> 00:20:06,024
We're having
difficulty...

162
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:07,859
Send in Frost.

163
00:20:16,785 --> 00:20:17,786
Deacon Frost.

164
00:20:21,873 --> 00:20:24,250
You can come in now.

165
00:20:57,325 --> 00:20:59,285
These nightclubs of yours
are dangerous.

166
00:20:59,744 --> 00:21:01,246
Are they?

167
00:21:01,704 --> 00:21:04,124
They draw needless
attention to our kind.

168
00:21:04,582 --> 00:21:05,375
You know our policy.

169
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:07,585
Your policy,
not mine.

170
00:21:08,044 --> 00:21:09,712
Our livelihood...

171
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:15,051
depends on our ability
to blend in

172
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,470
and our discretion.

173
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:21,266
Maybe it's time we forgot
about discretion.

174
00:21:21,725 --> 00:21:23,143
We should be ruling
the humans,

175
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:24,310
not running around

176
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:26,146
making back-alley treaties
with them.

177
00:21:26,604 --> 00:21:28,648
For fuck's sake,
these people are our food,

178
00:21:29,107 --> 00:21:29,691
not our allies.

179
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,151
You're out of line, Frost.

180
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:32,986
Am I?

181
00:21:33,445 --> 00:21:34,904
Or maybe I'm just
The first to say out loud

182
00:21:35,363 --> 00:21:36,448
what we've
all been thinking.

183
00:21:36,906 --> 00:21:38,324
We have existed this way

184
00:21:38,783 --> 00:21:41,119
for thousands of years.

185
00:21:41,578 --> 00:21:42,162
Who are you

186
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,999
to challenge our ways?

187
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,626
You're not even
a pureblood.

188
00:21:52,088 --> 00:21:53,339
Like it matters.

189
00:21:54,674 --> 00:21:58,094
I was born a vampire,

190
00:21:58,553 --> 00:22:01,723
as was every other member
of this house,

191
00:22:02,182 --> 00:22:03,433
but you, Frost...

192
00:22:06,936 --> 00:22:09,481
you were merely turned.

193
00:22:11,775 --> 00:22:13,234
The world belongs to us,

194
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:15,653
not the humans.

195
00:22:16,112 --> 00:22:17,447
You know that.

196
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,537
Do we have any other
business to discuss?

197
00:22:24,996 --> 00:22:27,123
Well, uh...

198
00:22:27,582 --> 00:22:29,084
there's the matter of
our offshore accounts.

199
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:30,335
We're having
difficulty...

200
00:22:30,794 --> 00:22:31,586
And have you made
the transfer to the...

201
00:22:32,045 --> 00:22:33,046
Gitano...

202
00:22:33,505 --> 00:22:37,425
you may wake upone day
and find yourself extinct.

203
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:11,626
You're a week early.

204
00:23:12,085 --> 00:23:13,503
Yeah.

205
00:23:20,927 --> 00:23:23,471
Whistler says I'm building up
a resistance to the serum.

206
00:23:26,725 --> 00:23:29,310
Yeah, I figured
that might happen.

207
00:23:38,236 --> 00:23:40,947
You take care, all right?

208
00:25:24,843 --> 00:25:27,178
I must be getting
soft in my old age,

209
00:25:27,637 --> 00:25:30,598
letting you bring home
a stray like that.

210
00:25:31,057 --> 00:25:33,226
It was damn stupid of you.

211
00:25:33,685 --> 00:25:35,645
Might've lucked out,
though.

212
00:25:36,938 --> 00:25:39,399
I checked her background.

213
00:25:41,985 --> 00:25:45,071
It turns out
she's a haematologist.

214
00:25:46,156 --> 00:25:49,159
She might be useful to us.

215
00:25:49,617 --> 00:25:50,994
I doubt it.

216
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:54,080
I'm serious.

217
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:55,999
I took a look
at that notebook of hers.

218
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:58,585
She's onto something.

219
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:02,756
I had to increase
the dose.

220
00:26:04,382 --> 00:26:06,092
It's over
50 milligrams now.

221
00:26:06,551 --> 00:26:07,510
That's getting
dangerous.

222
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:09,053
Just do it,

223
00:26:09,512 --> 00:26:11,264
old man.

224
00:26:12,348 --> 00:26:14,184
Ahh.

225
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,612
Uhh...

226
00:27:11,616 --> 00:27:13,827
Wander off
the beaten path, Doctor?

227
00:27:15,829 --> 00:27:17,080
Who are you people?

228
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:18,665
My name's
Abraham Whistler.

229
00:27:20,417 --> 00:27:21,751
You've met Blade.

230
00:27:37,892 --> 00:27:39,394
So, am I
a prisoner here?

231
00:27:41,438 --> 00:27:43,022
Not at all.

232
00:27:43,481 --> 00:27:44,649
We just had to take
certain precautions

233
00:27:45,108 --> 00:27:47,110
before we let you go.

234
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:49,237
You got to understand,

235
00:27:49,696 --> 00:27:50,655
they're everywhere.

236
00:27:51,114 --> 00:27:52,907
Vampires...

237
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:54,784
the Hominus nocturna.

238
00:27:56,244 --> 00:27:57,412
We hunt them, you see...

239
00:27:57,871 --> 00:27:59,497
moving from one city
to the next

240
00:27:59,956 --> 00:28:01,166
tracking
their migrations.

241
00:28:01,624 --> 00:28:02,751
They're hard to kill.

242
00:28:03,209 --> 00:28:04,627
They tend to regenerate.

243
00:28:05,086 --> 00:28:06,171
And I'm supposed
to believe all this?

244
00:28:06,629 --> 00:28:09,674
Well, you already met
Mr Crispy at the hospital.

245
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:11,468
What do you think?

246
00:28:13,511 --> 00:28:15,054
So, what do you use, then?

247
00:28:15,513 --> 00:28:17,182
Stakes? Crosses?

248
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,142
Crosses don't do squat.

249
00:28:19,601 --> 00:28:22,228
Some of the legends
are true, though.

250
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:25,523
Vampires are severely
allergic to sliver.

251
00:28:25,982 --> 00:28:27,525
Feed them garlic,

252
00:28:27,984 --> 00:28:29,069
and they go into
anaphylactic shock.

253
00:28:29,527 --> 00:28:31,071
Then, of course,
there's always sunlight,

254
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:32,989
ultraviolet rays.

255
00:28:33,448 --> 00:28:36,117
I got this sucker
running.

256
00:28:36,576 --> 00:28:38,661
You want to give it
a try tonight?

257
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:45,752
It's still heavy.

258
00:28:47,378 --> 00:28:48,546
Well, you're so big.

259
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:52,258
If you want to live
to see another day,

260
00:28:52,717 --> 00:28:54,177
you'll be out of town
by nightfall.

261
00:28:54,636 --> 00:28:56,638
So where am I
supposed to go?

262
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:02,602
You've been exposed to them.

263
00:29:03,061 --> 00:29:06,398
One way or another, somebody's
Going to take you out.

264
00:29:10,902 --> 00:29:13,780
There's a war going on
out there.

265
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:16,699
Blade, myself,
a few others,

266
00:29:17,158 --> 00:29:18,076
we've tried to keep it
from spilling over

267
00:29:18,535 --> 00:29:19,160
onto the streets.

268
00:29:20,745 --> 00:29:21,746
Sometimes,
people like yourself

269
00:29:22,205 --> 00:29:24,624
get caught
in the crossfire.

270
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:27,127
I have blood samples.
I can go to the police.

271
00:29:27,585 --> 00:29:30,046
They own the police.

272
00:29:30,505 --> 00:29:31,923
You have to understand,
they're everywhere.

273
00:29:32,382 --> 00:29:34,259
Chances are you've
seen them yourself

274
00:29:34,717 --> 00:29:35,343
and didn't know it...

275
00:29:35,802 --> 00:29:37,595
on the subway
or in a bar.

276
00:29:39,764 --> 00:29:42,142
So that's it?

277
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,603
You guys just patch me up
and send me on my way?

278
00:29:49,774 --> 00:29:51,067
Here.

279
00:29:51,526 --> 00:29:52,861
Vampire mace...

280
00:29:54,446 --> 00:29:56,114
sliver nitrate,
essence of garlic.

281
00:29:56,573 --> 00:29:58,783
You keep your eyes open.

282
00:29:59,242 --> 00:30:01,119
Be careful.

283
00:30:05,331 --> 00:30:06,666
One other thing...

284
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:10,170
buy yourself a gun.

285
00:30:10,628 --> 00:30:14,215
If you start getting
sensitive to day light...

286
00:30:14,674 --> 00:30:16,426
if you find
you're thirsty

287
00:30:16,885 --> 00:30:19,679
regardless of how much
you had to drink,

288
00:30:20,138 --> 00:30:21,222
then I suggest
you take that gun

289
00:30:21,681 --> 00:30:24,267
and use it on yourself.

290
00:30:27,145 --> 00:30:29,481
Better that
than the alternative.

291
00:31:27,414 --> 00:31:29,165
You have been warned
before.

292
00:31:29,624 --> 00:31:30,667
These archives
are restricted

293
00:31:31,126 --> 00:31:34,129
to members
of the House of Erebus.

294
00:31:36,339 --> 00:31:37,924
You are wasting your time.

295
00:31:38,383 --> 00:31:40,009
It's a dead language.

296
00:31:40,468 --> 00:31:44,222
The ancient texts
can never be translated.

297
00:31:44,681 --> 00:31:47,517
You wouldn't even
Understand them.

298
00:31:49,728 --> 00:31:50,562
Damn it, Frost!

299
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,105
I'm talking to you!

300
00:31:53,481 --> 00:31:55,775
Shh.

301
00:31:56,234 --> 00:31:58,653
Keep your voice down,
Gitano.

302
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,906
We're in a library.

303
00:32:02,365 --> 00:32:03,366
You don’t need
to shout.

304
00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:07,746
What are you up to,
Frost?

305
00:32:18,256 --> 00:32:21,468
What are you
Going to do, hmm?

306
00:32:26,014 --> 00:32:27,015
What?

307
00:32:32,645 --> 00:32:34,105
You bore me.

308
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:04,385
Hey!

309
00:33:09,182 --> 00:33:11,643
Remember
what we told you.

310
00:33:12,102 --> 00:33:13,937
You keep your eyes open.

311
00:33:14,396 --> 00:33:15,021
They're everywhere.

312
00:33:17,232 --> 00:33:18,817
But it's daytime!

313
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,919
How you doing?

314
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,166
Hit here. Hey.

315
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:41,251
I'm sorry. Whoa, whoa!

316
00:35:41,709 --> 00:35:43,128
Whoa. Hold on,
Hold on, Hold on.

317
00:35:43,586 --> 00:35:44,170
Police officer.

318
00:35:44,629 --> 00:35:45,463
I'm sorry, OK?

319
00:35:45,922 --> 00:35:47,048
Police officer. I didn't
mean to scare you.

320
00:35:47,507 --> 00:35:48,133
The front door was open.

321
00:35:48,591 --> 00:35:49,259
What are you doing in here?

322
00:35:49,717 --> 00:35:52,554
I'm just here
on a routine check.

323
00:35:53,012 --> 00:35:54,180
Look, I'm...
I'm Officer Krieger,

324
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:55,640
42nd precinct.

325
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,643
You're Karen Jenson,
right?

326
00:35:59,102 --> 00:36:00,437
Yeah.

327
00:36:00,895 --> 00:36:02,147
Your co-workers
at the hospital

328
00:36:02,605 --> 00:36:05,734
said that you were
kidnapped last night.

329
00:36:06,192 --> 00:36:07,235
Are you OK?

330
00:36:07,694 --> 00:36:10,780
What happened to
the other doctor I was with?

331
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:13,324
Curtis Webb?

332
00:36:13,783 --> 00:36:15,285
Um, he died.

333
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:17,328
No, look,

334
00:36:17,787 --> 00:36:18,913
don't worry about that
right now, OK?

335
00:36:19,372 --> 00:36:20,957
Why?

336
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:24,627
Because you're dead,
too, you bitch.

337
00:36:25,086 --> 00:36:26,296
Aah!

338
00:36:28,006 --> 00:36:29,048
Bitch!
What is it?

339
00:36:32,635 --> 00:36:33,511
What is this, garlic?

340
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,181
Yeah. He said it would
work against vampires.

341
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:38,099
Vampires?

342
00:36:39,267 --> 00:36:41,478
Who said I was
a vampire, huh?

343
00:36:43,521 --> 00:36:44,814
Nobody.

344
00:36:49,778 --> 00:36:51,946
He's a familiar...

345
00:36:52,405 --> 00:36:54,074
a vampire wannabe.

346
00:36:54,532 --> 00:36:57,243
If he's loyal enough

347
00:36:57,702 --> 00:37:02,207
and he proves himself, maybe
his master will turn him.

348
00:37:02,665 --> 00:37:04,667
Wait a minute.
You used me as bait?

349
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:06,920
Get over it.

350
00:37:11,549 --> 00:37:12,592
Is all that necessary?

351
00:37:17,555 --> 00:37:19,432
That's a glyph...

352
00:37:19,891 --> 00:37:21,059
a vampire cattle brand.

353
00:37:21,518 --> 00:37:24,020
It means that Officer Krieger
is somebody's property.

354
00:37:24,479 --> 00:37:26,147
Another vampire tries
to bleed this little hooker,

355
00:37:26,606 --> 00:37:29,025
then they have to answer
to his owner.

356
00:37:30,902 --> 00:37:32,737
Deacon Frost.

357
00:37:33,196 --> 00:37:35,198
We've been tracking him
for a long time.

358
00:37:35,657 --> 00:37:37,033
All right.

359
00:37:37,492 --> 00:37:38,743
Officer Krieger,

360
00:37:39,202 --> 00:37:41,621
you Going to be a good
little bloodhound, huh?

361
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,540
Tell us what your master's
been up to.

362
00:37:43,998 --> 00:37:44,707
Oh, great,
now you're robbing him.

363
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:46,209
You going
to rob me, too?

364
00:37:46,668 --> 00:37:49,337
How do you think that we
Fund this organization, huh?

365
00:37:49,796 --> 00:37:53,299
We're not exactly
the March of Dimes.

366
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,678
It's fake.

367
00:37:59,472 --> 00:38:00,557
Well...

368
00:38:01,015 --> 00:38:03,685
looks like our friend here
has been blood running, huh?

369
00:38:04,144 --> 00:38:05,311
Hillbarn Clinic.

370
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:06,813
I know this place.
It's a blood bank.

371
00:38:07,272 --> 00:38:08,106
Owned by vampires,

372
00:38:08,565 --> 00:38:09,566
and there's one
in every city.

373
00:38:10,024 --> 00:38:11,151
And they always deliver.

374
00:38:11,609 --> 00:38:12,944
So, where were you
taking it?

375
00:38:13,403 --> 00:38:14,821
I don't know what
you're talking... aah!

376
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:15,864
Ooh!

377
00:38:16,322 --> 00:38:18,199
Look, take it easy.

378
00:38:18,658 --> 00:38:20,368
I'm only Going to ask you
one more time.

379
00:38:20,827 --> 00:38:23,079
Where were you taking it?

380
00:38:23,538 --> 00:38:24,789
Go fuck yourself.

381
00:38:25,248 --> 00:38:26,708
Fuck me?
No, you fuck this.

382
00:38:44,184 --> 00:38:45,935
You better wake up.

383
00:38:46,394 --> 00:38:49,189
The world you live in is
Just a sugar-coated topping.

384
00:38:49,647 --> 00:38:51,733
There is another world
beneath it...

385
00:38:52,192 --> 00:38:52,942
the real world.

386
00:38:53,401 --> 00:38:54,194
And if you want
to survive it,

387
00:38:54,652 --> 00:38:57,572
you better learn
to pull the trigger.

388
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,285
Wait a minute.

389
00:39:02,744 --> 00:39:03,328
I'm coming with you.

390
00:39:03,787 --> 00:39:04,788
You're useless.

391
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:10,752
I have to stick with you.

392
00:39:11,211 --> 00:39:13,088
It's the only way that
I'll stay alive long enough

393
00:39:13,546 --> 00:39:15,215
to find a cure for myself.

394
00:39:15,673 --> 00:39:17,592
There is no cure.

395
00:39:26,226 --> 00:39:28,895
He's not going
to come back.

396
00:39:30,146 --> 00:39:31,648
Nobody's that’s stupid.

397
00:39:32,107 --> 00:39:34,943
When you understand
the nature of a thing,

398
00:39:35,402 --> 00:39:37,112
you know what
it's capable of.

399
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:55,755
It's Krieger.

400
00:39:56,214 --> 00:39:57,090
I'm at 16-0-0-9.

401
00:39:57,549 --> 00:39:58,383
Yes?

402
00:39:58,842 --> 00:39:59,926
Get me through.

403
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,765
I got a delivery
in progress here,

404
00:40:06,224 --> 00:40:07,517
and I just had a run-in
with Blade.

405
00:40:13,982 --> 00:40:16,568
I got to clear out
that clinic on Hillbarn now!

406
00:40:37,297 --> 00:40:39,549
Looks like
we hit pay dirt.

407
00:40:40,008 --> 00:40:41,509
That's a vampire mark.

408
00:40:41,968 --> 00:40:42,761
It means that
there's a safe house

409
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:44,345
around here somewhere...

410
00:40:44,804 --> 00:40:47,348
a place they can go
with donors coming.

411
00:40:47,807 --> 00:40:49,642
See the valets
over there?

412
00:40:50,101 --> 00:40:51,269
They're vampires.

413
00:40:51,728 --> 00:40:53,813
So is the doorman

414
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,775
and the whore
on the corner.

415
00:40:57,233 --> 00:40:58,568
How can you tell?

416
00:40:59,027 --> 00:41:00,779
By the way they move...

417
00:41:01,237 --> 00:41:02,238
the way they smell.

418
00:41:02,697 --> 00:41:03,698
Psst.

419
00:41:06,743 --> 00:41:08,369
It's like a bad dream.

420
00:41:08,828 --> 00:41:10,830
There are worse things
out tonight than vampires.

421
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:12,123
Like what?

422
00:41:12,582 --> 00:41:13,958
Like me.

423
00:41:15,627 --> 00:41:17,420
OK, Vampire Anatomy 101.

424
00:41:17,879 --> 00:41:19,172
Crosses and holy water
don't do dick,

425
00:41:19,631 --> 00:41:21,174
so forget what you've seen
in the movies.

426
00:41:21,633 --> 00:41:23,510
You use a stake, sliver,
or sun light.

427
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,553
You know how to use
one of these?

428
00:41:26,012 --> 00:41:26,721
Nope...

429
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,556
but I'll damn sure
learn quick.

430
00:41:29,015 --> 00:41:30,183
The safety's off,
rounds already chambered...

431
00:41:30,642 --> 00:41:31,476
sliver hollow point
filled with garlic.

432
00:41:31,935 --> 00:41:33,144
You aim for the head
or the heart.

433
00:41:33,603 --> 00:41:35,146
Anything else is your ass.

434
00:41:37,649 --> 00:41:39,109
Do you have
an invitation?

435
00:42:09,931 --> 00:42:11,182
What you got?

436
00:42:28,366 --> 00:42:29,743
Kenji!

437
00:42:43,548 --> 00:42:44,758
Ohh!

438
00:42:45,216 --> 00:42:46,259
Where's the entrance?

439
00:42:46,718 --> 00:42:47,427
I can't tell you
that, man.

440
00:42:47,886 --> 00:42:49,345
Uhh!

441
00:42:51,848 --> 00:42:53,224
I'm Going to ask you
one more time.

442
00:42:53,683 --> 00:42:55,143
Where's the entrance?

443
00:42:55,602 --> 00:42:57,437
OK. OK.

444
00:42:58,521 --> 00:43:00,523
It's in the freezer.

445
00:43:09,783 --> 00:43:11,034
Come on, man!
I told you!

446
00:43:11,493 --> 00:43:13,495
It's in the fridge!

447
00:43:22,087 --> 00:43:22,712
OK.

448
00:43:23,171 --> 00:43:24,964
You give Frost
a message from me.

449
00:43:25,423 --> 00:43:27,634
You tell him it's
open season on suck heads.

450
00:44:10,427 --> 00:44:13,054
Some kind of archive.

451
00:44:16,933 --> 00:44:19,102
This must be where they keep
most of their records.

452
00:44:19,561 --> 00:44:21,312
Isn't this just
a little high-tech?

453
00:44:21,771 --> 00:44:23,815
They've got their claws
into everything...

454
00:44:24,274 --> 00:44:25,859
politics, finance,
real estate.

455
00:44:26,317 --> 00:44:29,320
They already own
half of downtown.

456
00:44:52,635 --> 00:44:54,220
Frost throws a good party.

457
00:44:54,679 --> 00:44:55,805
Yeah...

458
00:44:56,264 --> 00:44:57,891
but where is he?

459
00:45:11,988 --> 00:45:13,198
Come on, baby.

460
00:45:22,707 --> 00:45:25,335
Don't keep everyone
waiting.

461
00:45:44,521 --> 00:45:45,563
Deacon,

462
00:45:46,022 --> 00:45:48,733
there's someone here
to see you.

463
00:45:51,236 --> 00:45:53,988
I got to talk to you,
Frost.

464
00:45:54,447 --> 00:45:56,199
I'm sorry.
I had to come here.

465
00:45:56,658 --> 00:45:58,243
It's a mistake
Going to Pearl's.

466
00:45:58,701 --> 00:46:00,829
I know that.
Dumb fucking me.

467
00:46:01,287 --> 00:46:02,122
I know you're
disappointed.

468
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:03,164
Am I that
transparent?

469
00:46:03,623 --> 00:46:04,207
You want
to meet him?

470
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:05,250
Yeah.

471
00:46:05,708 --> 00:46:06,543
I can get you guys
in with him,

472
00:46:07,001 --> 00:46:08,253
because we're tight.
We're like brothers.

473
00:46:08,711 --> 00:46:09,754
Fuck.

474
00:46:10,213 --> 00:46:11,005
Aw, fuck. Frost.

475
00:46:11,464 --> 00:46:12,465
Hey.
Yeah.

476
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:15,009
Deac. Deac.

477
00:46:15,468 --> 00:46:17,262
I've been telling these
bitches all about you, man.

478
00:46:17,721 --> 00:46:18,513
They've been dying
to meet you.

479
00:46:18,972 --> 00:46:19,597
They are so psyched.

480
00:46:20,056 --> 00:46:21,141
Bad ass bitches.
They...

481
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:22,517
Hi.

482
00:46:22,976 --> 00:46:23,560
Deac?

483
00:46:24,018 --> 00:46:26,229
Frost, it's about Blade.

484
00:46:26,688 --> 00:46:27,647
Aw, he's busy, you know?

485
00:46:28,106 --> 00:46:29,482
Because, like, when
he's focused on business...

486
00:46:29,941 --> 00:46:32,402
Look, Frost,
this is important.

487
00:46:32,861 --> 00:46:34,446
Blade was waiting for me,

488
00:46:34,904 --> 00:46:36,906
using the girl as bait.

489
00:46:37,365 --> 00:46:38,783
And you were stupid
enough to take it.

490
00:46:39,242 --> 00:46:39,993
Shut up, bitch.

491
00:46:40,452 --> 00:46:41,494
I didn't know he was
Going to be there.

492
00:46:41,953 --> 00:46:42,954
It was a trap, see?

493
00:46:43,413 --> 00:46:44,289
But don't worry
About it.

494
00:46:44,748 --> 00:46:46,374
It's no problem. We can
still get the girl.

495
00:46:47,917 --> 00:46:49,169
Yeah!

496
00:46:56,009 --> 00:46:57,177
Whoo!

497
00:47:18,114 --> 00:47:19,157
Forget the girl.

498
00:47:19,616 --> 00:47:20,575
I want Blade.

499
00:47:21,034 --> 00:47:22,452
I know you do.

500
00:47:22,911 --> 00:47:23,495
You hear me, Quinn?

501
00:47:23,953 --> 00:47:25,872
I want him alive.

502
00:47:26,331 --> 00:47:27,332
What?

503
00:47:30,168 --> 00:47:31,044
Wait a minute, man.

504
00:47:31,503 --> 00:47:33,296
You want him alive?

505
00:47:36,299 --> 00:47:37,842
What's that smell?

506
00:47:40,804 --> 00:47:42,639
...image carefully, Frost.

507
00:47:43,098 --> 00:47:48,103
You will need 12 purebloods
to make the ritual work.

508
00:47:48,561 --> 00:47:50,105
Krieger, is that you?

509
00:47:50,563 --> 00:47:51,356
He... he's here!

510
00:47:51,815 --> 00:47:52,399
He's here!

511
00:47:52,857 --> 00:47:54,150
This must be Pearl,

512
00:47:54,609 --> 00:47:55,193
the record keeper.

513
00:47:57,487 --> 00:47:59,239
He's Going to kill me!

514
00:47:59,697 --> 00:48:01,741
You need me, Frost!
You need me!

515
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,451
Pearl, you're history.

516
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:05,995
Have the good grace to die
with some fuckin' dignity.

517
00:48:06,454 --> 00:48:07,789
Frost.

518
00:48:08,248 --> 00:48:09,791
Ruthless bloodsucker.

519
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:11,042
Congratulations, Blade.

520
00:48:11,501 --> 00:48:12,585
Frost.

521
00:48:13,044 --> 00:48:14,212
I hear you've
been lookin' for me.

522
00:48:14,671 --> 00:48:15,255
I'm flattered.

523
00:48:15,714 --> 00:48:17,132
It'll pass.

524
00:48:19,634 --> 00:48:20,218
Fuck.

525
00:48:23,138 --> 00:48:23,805
What is that?

526
00:48:24,264 --> 00:48:26,349
That, biscuit boy,
is a U.V. lamp.

527
00:48:26,808 --> 00:48:27,434
We're gonna play

528
00:48:27,892 --> 00:48:29,227
a little game
of 20 questions.

529
00:48:29,686 --> 00:48:30,979
Depending on
how you answer,

530
00:48:31,438 --> 00:48:33,940
you may walk out
of here with a tan.

531
00:48:34,399 --> 00:48:35,275
What's that?

532
00:48:35,734 --> 00:48:37,110
Oh, that?
Oh, it's nothing.

533
00:48:37,569 --> 00:48:39,112
It's routine research.
Heh heh.

534
00:48:39,571 --> 00:48:41,406
Actually,
it's a video game.

535
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:53,877
That must've hurt.

536
00:48:54,335 --> 00:48:55,920
It's a fragment,
a piece of the prophecy!

537
00:48:56,379 --> 00:48:57,213
What prophecy?

538
00:48:57,672 --> 00:48:59,132
Oh, I'm not really sure.

539
00:48:59,591 --> 00:49:01,301
There are so many out...

540
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,985
And there is nothing you
can do about it, daywalker!

541
00:49:19,444 --> 00:49:20,904
Is that so?

542
00:49:21,362 --> 00:49:24,032
Well, that's
what Frost says.

543
00:49:24,491 --> 00:49:25,742
Then you won't mind me

544
00:49:26,201 --> 00:49:28,620
borrowing this
for a while, will you?

545
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:30,622
If he moves, fry him.

546
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:34,542
What's in here?

547
00:49:35,001 --> 00:49:35,794
Nothing.
It's a... a storeroom.

548
00:49:36,252 --> 00:49:37,337
But you’re
wasting your time.

549
00:49:37,796 --> 00:49:39,422
There's nothing
of importance to anyone.

550
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:41,424
Then you won't mind
if I take a peek.

551
00:49:41,883 --> 00:49:42,967
No!

552
00:50:05,615 --> 00:50:06,950
He moved.

553
00:50:37,772 --> 00:50:39,983
What is this?

554
00:50:41,568 --> 00:50:42,485
These are the pages

555
00:50:42,944 --> 00:50:44,863
from The Book
of Erebus,

556
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:46,698
the Vampire Bible.

557
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:51,703
It contains everything...

558
00:50:52,162 --> 00:50:53,580
their entire history.

559
00:50:54,831 --> 00:50:58,376
La Magra must be
one of their legends.

560
00:51:01,046 --> 00:51:03,214
Why is Frost
so interested in La Magra?

561
00:51:03,673 --> 00:51:04,883
Shh!

562
00:51:42,128 --> 00:51:43,630
Give me your hand.

563
00:51:46,674 --> 00:51:49,427
Do you remember me?

564
00:52:07,612 --> 00:52:09,197
Give it to him!

565
00:52:25,046 --> 00:52:25,964
Hey! Hey!

566
00:52:26,423 --> 00:52:28,133
Nice one.

567
00:52:28,591 --> 00:52:29,175
Heh.

568
00:52:29,634 --> 00:52:30,343
Well, well, well.

569
00:52:30,802 --> 00:52:32,595
You took my arm, man.

570
00:52:33,054 --> 00:52:34,556
Remember?

571
00:52:35,014 --> 00:52:36,391
But it's cool.

572
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:38,893
I gota new one.

573
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,272
Think I'll ever
play piano again?

574
00:52:44,315 --> 00:52:45,942
You can slice him,
you can dice him,

575
00:52:46,401 --> 00:52:48,027
but the Quinn man
just keeps on comin'!

576
00:52:48,486 --> 00:52:49,195
Check it out.

577
00:52:49,654 --> 00:52:51,448
I've got his pig sticker.

578
00:52:51,906 --> 00:52:53,241
Ah ha ha ha...

579
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:54,409
Ohh! Aah!

580
00:52:54,868 --> 00:52:57,287
You're a fuckup, Crease!
Ha ha ha ha!

581
00:52:58,913 --> 00:52:59,664
You're a fuckup!

582
00:53:00,123 --> 00:53:01,291
"I got his pig sticker!"

583
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:02,500
Ohh.

584
00:53:02,959 --> 00:53:05,003
You're just
full of surprises,

585
00:53:05,462 --> 00:53:06,755
ain'tyou, chief?

586
00:53:15,013 --> 00:53:17,015
Stay with me, sweetness...

587
00:53:17,474 --> 00:53:20,393
'cause I'm not finished
with you yet.

588
00:53:22,645 --> 00:53:24,439
Ah, looky here.

589
00:53:26,483 --> 00:53:27,984
Sliver.

590
00:53:28,443 --> 00:53:29,652
Nice craftsmanship, huh?

591
00:53:30,111 --> 00:53:31,780
Probably costyou
a pretty penny.

592
00:53:32,238 --> 00:53:36,367
Now, this here is a man
who takes his job...

593
00:53:37,744 --> 00:53:40,747
just a little too seriously,
don't you think?

594
00:53:45,001 --> 00:53:47,253
Come to think of it, Blade,

595
00:53:47,712 --> 00:53:49,422
I owe you one.

596
00:53:53,927 --> 00:53:56,471
Actually, if you want
to get technical, Blade...

597
00:53:58,139 --> 00:53:59,516
I owe you two.

598
00:54:02,602 --> 00:54:04,687
Oh, what's so funny,
bright eyes?

599
00:54:07,941 --> 00:54:09,776
I'm expecting company.

600
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:27,210
Catch you fuckers
at a bad time?

601
00:54:27,669 --> 00:54:28,878
No! No guns!

602
00:54:31,005 --> 00:54:32,507
No! No! No!

603
00:54:39,264 --> 00:54:40,598
No! Fuckin' this way!

604
00:54:49,691 --> 00:54:50,859
Drop the guns!

605
00:54:51,317 --> 00:54:52,235
I need him!

606
00:54:52,694 --> 00:54:54,904
He wants Blade alive! Go!

607
00:54:59,409 --> 00:55:00,869
You've been
listening in the whole time?

608
00:55:01,327 --> 00:55:02,287
Keeping
radio contact.

609
00:55:02,746 --> 00:55:05,582
Think I'd let him run loose
without a chaperon?

610
00:55:13,673 --> 00:55:16,176
Christ!
I'm too old for this.

611
00:55:16,634 --> 00:55:18,803
Somebody get me
a god-damn wheelchair.

612
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:28,396
Whistler!

613
00:55:28,855 --> 00:55:30,482
He can take care
of himself.

614
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:31,941
Jump!

615
00:55:52,962 --> 00:55:55,048
Aah!

616
00:56:07,894 --> 00:56:09,270
Aah!

617
00:56:31,835 --> 00:56:34,713
Aah!

618
00:56:41,094 --> 00:56:42,887
Aah!

619
00:56:52,939 --> 00:56:54,691
What are you
gonna do?

620
00:56:55,775 --> 00:56:57,152
Oh, my God.

621
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:13,293
What's wrong?

622
00:57:15,754 --> 00:57:17,589
It's dislocated.

623
00:57:18,048 --> 00:57:19,340
Ah!

624
00:57:19,799 --> 00:57:21,301
Let me help you.

625
00:57:24,345 --> 00:57:25,889
Aah!

626
00:57:32,937 --> 00:57:33,855
Let me give you...

627
00:57:34,314 --> 00:57:36,066
No! Getaway.

628
00:57:51,748 --> 00:57:53,833
You're one of them,
aren't you?

629
00:57:56,711 --> 00:57:58,004
No.

630
00:57:58,463 --> 00:57:59,756
I'm something else.

631
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:09,974
I found him
when he was 13.

632
00:58:10,433 --> 00:58:11,976
He'd been livin'
on the streets,

633
00:58:12,435 --> 00:58:13,978
feedin' off
the homeless.

634
00:58:14,437 --> 00:58:16,940
His need for blood had
taken over at puberty.

635
00:58:17,399 --> 00:58:20,985
I took him
for a vampire at first.

636
00:58:21,444 --> 00:58:22,821
Almost killed him, too.

637
00:58:23,279 --> 00:58:25,907
Then I realized
what he was.

638
00:58:26,366 --> 00:58:29,077
Blade's mother was
attacked by a vampire

639
00:58:29,536 --> 00:58:30,954
while she was pregnant.

640
00:58:31,413 --> 00:58:33,915
She died, but he lived.

641
00:58:34,374 --> 00:58:35,125
Unfortunately,

642
00:58:35,583 --> 00:58:37,711
he'd undergone
certain genetic changes.

643
00:58:38,169 --> 00:58:41,673
He can withstand
garlic, sliver,

644
00:58:42,132 --> 00:58:43,258
even sunlight,

645
00:58:43,717 --> 00:58:45,301
and he's got
their strength.

646
00:58:46,386 --> 00:58:47,178
This time tomorrow,

647
00:58:47,637 --> 00:58:50,390
all those wounds of his
will be healed.

648
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:54,436
He still ages
like a human, though.

649
00:58:54,894 --> 00:58:57,021
See, vampires
age slower than us.

650
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:00,608
Unfortunately...

651
00:59:01,067 --> 00:59:02,986
he also inherited
their thirst.

652
00:59:04,487 --> 00:59:07,157
I thought the serum was
supposed to suppress that.

653
00:59:07,615 --> 00:59:09,868
Time's runnin' out.

654
00:59:11,411 --> 00:59:14,330
His body's
startin' to reject it.

655
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:18,877
So far, all my efforts
to find a cure have falled.

656
00:59:23,506 --> 00:59:25,300
Why do you hunt them?

657
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:29,596
I had a family once...

658
00:59:30,055 --> 00:59:32,307
wife and two daughters.

659
00:59:34,726 --> 00:59:37,062
Then a drifter came
callin' one evenin',

660
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,521
a vampire.

661
00:59:40,648 --> 00:59:42,025
He toyed with 'em first,

662
00:59:42,484 --> 00:59:44,903
tried to make me decide

663
00:59:45,361 --> 00:59:47,072
which order
they'd die in.

664
00:59:50,825 --> 00:59:53,787
We kill as many of 'em
as we can find,

665
00:59:54,245 --> 00:59:55,413
but it's gettin' worse.

666
00:59:55,872 --> 00:59:57,040
Because of Frost.

667
00:59:57,499 --> 00:59:58,124
There's somethin'
happenin'

668
00:59:58,583 --> 01:00:00,543
in the vampire ranks.

669
01:00:01,002 --> 01:00:02,003
It's somethin' big...

670
01:00:02,462 --> 01:00:03,838
and I'd stake my life

671
01:00:04,297 --> 01:00:07,842
that son of a bitch
is at the centre of it.

672
01:00:11,596 --> 01:00:12,597
Blade.

673
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:32,367
Whistler told me
what happened.

674
01:00:35,245 --> 01:00:38,832
He told me
what you are.

675
01:00:41,668 --> 01:00:43,420
You don't know me.

676
01:00:43,878 --> 01:00:45,797
You don't know
anything about me.

677
01:00:49,134 --> 01:00:51,177
I'm not human.

678
01:00:53,888 --> 01:00:55,140
You look human
to me...

679
01:00:55,598 --> 01:00:58,101
Humans don't
drink blood.

680
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,687
That was
a longtime ago.

681
01:01:01,146 --> 01:01:04,065
Maybe you should
let that go.

682
01:01:06,985 --> 01:01:08,486
I have spent
my whole life

683
01:01:08,945 --> 01:01:12,240
looking for that thing
that killed my mother.

684
01:01:12,699 --> 01:01:14,659
It made me what I am.

685
01:01:17,537 --> 01:01:21,124
And every time I take
one of those monsters out,

686
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:24,085
I geta little piece
of that life back,

687
01:01:24,544 --> 01:01:27,964
so don't you tell me
about forgetting.

688
01:01:31,134 --> 01:01:33,053
...my fault he took us
by surprise!

689
01:01:33,511 --> 01:01:35,305
Two of them against your
entire security force?

690
01:01:35,764 --> 01:01:37,766
Don't put that shit on me, OK,
'cause you were there, too!

691
01:01:38,224 --> 01:01:39,559
I'm sure Deacon
will appreciate...

692
01:01:40,018 --> 01:01:41,352
...stabbed in the balls
for it, all right?!

693
01:01:41,811 --> 01:01:42,645
Aah! You little skeez!

694
01:01:43,104 --> 01:01:44,397
Don't see the lifestyle
really suits you.

695
01:01:44,856 --> 01:01:46,649
I should put this stump through
that shit-eating grin of yours.

696
01:01:47,108 --> 01:01:48,318
Face it, angel.
You were sloppy.

697
01:01:48,777 --> 01:01:50,612
You got
what you deserved.

698
01:01:53,656 --> 01:01:55,992
Deac, let me
take this guy out, man.

699
01:01:56,451 --> 01:01:57,827
Look. Look what
he fuckin' did!

700
01:01:58,286 --> 01:01:59,204
He took my hand again!

701
01:01:59,662 --> 01:02:01,456
Listen to me.
I want him alive.

702
01:02:01,915 --> 01:02:03,458
What the fuck
are you talk...

703
01:02:03,917 --> 01:02:05,085
you want him alive?

704
01:02:05,543 --> 01:02:07,629
We've been tryin' to kill
this motherfucker for years.

705
01:02:08,088 --> 01:02:10,173
Are you out of
your fuckin' mind? Shh.

706
01:02:10,632 --> 01:02:14,260
Big guy, relax.

707
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:15,970
Be patient.

708
01:02:17,597 --> 01:02:19,724
Now, we gota lot
to do here.

709
01:02:20,183 --> 01:02:21,142
I need you, man.

710
01:02:21,601 --> 01:02:22,894
Heh.

711
01:02:23,353 --> 01:02:24,354
Heh.

712
01:02:25,563 --> 01:02:26,147
I need you.

713
01:02:26,606 --> 01:02:27,607
Yeah.

714
01:03:11,025 --> 01:03:12,569
Morning.

715
01:03:13,027 --> 01:03:14,571
How you feelin'?

716
01:03:23,997 --> 01:03:24,998
Look at that.

717
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:31,463
Whew. Gettin' a little
toasty out here, huh?

718
01:03:31,921 --> 01:03:32,505
Heh heh.

719
01:03:34,007 --> 01:03:35,133
When was the last time

720
01:03:35,592 --> 01:03:37,969
you stopped to appreciate
a good sunrise?

721
01:03:38,428 --> 01:03:40,346
Oh, that's right.
You were born a vampire,

722
01:03:40,805 --> 01:03:42,932
so you never had
the pleasure, have you?

723
01:03:43,391 --> 01:03:43,975
That's OK.

724
01:03:44,434 --> 01:03:45,101
It's all right.

725
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,686
Least we're here together.

726
01:03:47,145 --> 01:03:48,021
Share the moment,

727
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,191
which means a lot to me,
by the way, really.

728
01:03:51,649 --> 01:03:53,026
I mean that.

729
01:03:57,947 --> 01:03:59,908
I'm a fairly
sentimental type of guy.

730
01:04:00,366 --> 01:04:02,077
Bit of an innocent,
you might say.

731
01:04:05,455 --> 01:04:07,999
Do what you want,
Frost.

732
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:10,377
Doesn't make
any difference.

733
01:04:11,711 --> 01:04:14,672
You just don't
fuckin' get it.

734
01:04:15,965 --> 01:04:17,133
You're never
gonna be a pureblood.

735
01:04:17,592 --> 01:04:19,094
Hold him.

736
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:23,765
You will never rule us.

737
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:27,268
Aah!

738
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:32,148
Aah!

739
01:04:35,235 --> 01:04:36,027
Ow.

740
01:04:36,486 --> 01:04:38,113
Jesus Christ.

741
01:04:38,571 --> 01:04:39,364
Have a nice day.

742
01:04:39,823 --> 01:04:40,740
Sorry, you old dog.

743
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:43,868
You just gota little
too long in the tooth.

744
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:47,288
What, man?
That was funny.

745
01:04:47,747 --> 01:04:48,998
"Long, tooth."
Funny.

746
01:04:49,457 --> 01:04:51,793
Did I tell you
the one about...

747
01:04:54,129 --> 01:04:55,714
Aah!

748
01:05:21,531 --> 01:05:23,491
What have you done
with Dragonetti?

749
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:32,876
Let's get down to business,
shall we?

750
01:05:33,334 --> 01:05:36,463
I need 12 volunteers.
Tkk tkk.

751
01:05:42,469 --> 01:05:43,470
Whistler.

752
01:05:46,848 --> 01:05:48,016
What is this?

753
01:05:49,809 --> 01:05:52,020
Smells like a vampire
wiped his ass with it.

754
01:05:52,479 --> 01:05:53,730
I took it
from the archives.

755
01:05:54,189 --> 01:05:55,231
It's written in blood.

756
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:58,151
It's from
The Book of Erebus.

757
01:06:02,572 --> 01:06:04,991
I think it's what Frost
has been workin' on.

758
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:07,243
It's somethin'
about the Blood God,

759
01:06:07,702 --> 01:06:09,037
the spirits of the 12.

760
01:06:09,496 --> 01:06:10,121
I... I don't know.

761
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:11,873
I can't make out
the rest of it.

762
01:06:12,332 --> 01:06:13,541
Maybe this'll help.

763
01:06:14,626 --> 01:06:15,960
I'll figure out something.

764
01:06:17,629 --> 01:06:18,880
So what's all this?

765
01:06:19,339 --> 01:06:21,508
Took a trip to
the hospital last night,

766
01:06:21,966 --> 01:06:23,510
borrowed some equipment.

767
01:06:23,968 --> 01:06:26,596
For your
miracle cure?

768
01:06:28,515 --> 01:06:29,432
This is E.D.T.A.

769
01:06:29,891 --> 01:06:30,558
It's an anticoagulant.

770
01:06:31,017 --> 01:06:33,061
We use it
to treat blood clots.

771
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,481
Now look what happens
when I introduce it

772
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:39,359
onto a sample
of vampire blood.

773
01:06:40,568 --> 01:06:42,070
Take a step back.

774
01:06:42,529 --> 01:06:44,114
The reaction's
energetic.

775
01:06:53,581 --> 01:06:54,249
Some cure.

776
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:57,210
I didn't say E.D.T.A.
was a cure.

777
01:06:57,669 --> 01:06:59,212
But maybe
you could use it

778
01:06:59,671 --> 01:07:01,798
to explode
some vampire heads.

779
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:04,884
Wait a minute.

780
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:07,095
I need a sample
of your blood.

781
01:07:07,554 --> 01:07:08,304
Later.

782
01:07:08,763 --> 01:07:10,557
Gotta go downtown.

783
01:07:11,015 --> 01:07:11,850
Need some serum.

784
01:07:12,308 --> 01:07:13,226
Serum can wait.

785
01:07:13,685 --> 01:07:15,228
This is important.

786
01:07:37,375 --> 01:07:38,752
Is he sick?

787
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:40,211
Cancer.

788
01:07:42,464 --> 01:07:45,175
You have a lot of love
for him, don't you?

789
01:07:45,633 --> 01:07:47,594
We have
a good arrangement.

790
01:07:48,053 --> 01:07:50,597
He makes the weapons.
I use 'em.

791
01:07:54,642 --> 01:07:56,436
You know,
my mother used to say,

792
01:07:56,895 --> 01:07:59,147
"A cold heart
is a dead heart."

793
01:08:17,207 --> 01:08:18,708
You don't look so good.

794
01:08:19,793 --> 01:08:21,169
I'm just a little tired.

795
01:08:21,628 --> 01:08:22,796
You know we've been...

796
01:08:23,254 --> 01:08:24,589
workin' all night.

797
01:08:27,217 --> 01:08:29,677
I guess we didn't
catch it in time.

798
01:08:31,304 --> 01:08:32,389
You got another day,

799
01:08:32,847 --> 01:08:34,599
two at the most.

800
01:08:39,479 --> 01:08:41,356
For what it's worth,
I'm sorry.

801
01:08:41,815 --> 01:08:44,943
You make it sound
like I'm already dead.

802
01:09:03,044 --> 01:09:04,045
Blade.

803
01:09:29,487 --> 01:09:31,156
How you doin', chief?

804
01:09:32,574 --> 01:09:33,158
Easy.

805
01:09:35,201 --> 01:09:36,786
Wouldn't want
our little friend here

806
01:09:37,245 --> 01:09:40,206
to wind upon the back of
a milk carton, now would we?

807
01:09:41,624 --> 01:09:44,669
Ah, it's nice
to finally meet you, man.

808
01:09:45,128 --> 01:09:47,088
Had my eye on you
for years.

809
01:09:47,547 --> 01:09:48,673
I know all about you...

810
01:09:49,132 --> 01:09:51,676
your serum, Whistler...
everything.

811
01:09:52,135 --> 01:09:53,887
Sun block.

812
01:09:54,345 --> 01:09:56,014
Hey, it's a start, right?

813
01:09:56,473 --> 01:09:59,017
The goal, of course,
is to be like you,

814
01:09:59,476 --> 01:10:01,144
the daywalker.

815
01:10:01,603 --> 01:10:03,730
You got the best
of both worlds, don't you?

816
01:10:04,189 --> 01:10:06,441
All our strengths...

817
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:07,817
none of our weaknesses.

818
01:10:08,276 --> 01:10:10,945
Well, maybe I don't
see it that way.

819
01:10:11,404 --> 01:10:13,990
Oh, so it's back
to pretending we're human again?

820
01:10:14,449 --> 01:10:17,786
Come on. Spare me
the Uncle Tom routine, OK?

821
01:10:18,244 --> 01:10:20,997
You can't keep denying
what you are, man.

822
01:10:21,456 --> 01:10:22,582
Heh. You think the humans

823
01:10:23,041 --> 01:10:24,918
will ever accept
a half-breed like you?

824
01:10:25,377 --> 01:10:27,212
They can't.
They're afraid of you.

825
01:10:28,797 --> 01:10:30,048
And they should be.

826
01:10:30,507 --> 01:10:31,091
You're an animal.

827
01:10:31,549 --> 01:10:33,593
You're afuckin'
maniac.

828
01:10:36,513 --> 01:10:37,680
Look at 'em.

829
01:10:38,139 --> 01:10:40,016
They're cattle,

830
01:10:40,475 --> 01:10:42,018
pieces of meat.

831
01:10:42,477 --> 01:10:45,063
What difference does it make
how their world ends?

832
01:10:45,522 --> 01:10:46,106
Plague...

833
01:10:46,564 --> 01:10:47,607
war...

834
01:10:48,066 --> 01:10:49,234
famine.

835
01:10:49,692 --> 01:10:51,653
Morality doesn't even
enter into it.

836
01:10:52,112 --> 01:10:54,739
We're just a function
of natural selection, man,

837
01:10:55,198 --> 01:10:57,200
the new race.

838
01:10:58,785 --> 01:11:01,371
Looks like
your mascara's running.

839
01:11:08,545 --> 01:11:10,422
I'm offering you a truce.

840
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,090
I want you with us.

841
01:11:12,549 --> 01:11:14,509
What do you think,
I'm stupid?

842
01:11:23,143 --> 01:11:24,728
You're familiar
with the Blood God.

843
01:11:25,186 --> 01:11:27,480
Frost...

844
01:11:27,939 --> 01:11:30,150
you're nothing
to me...

845
01:11:30,608 --> 01:11:33,153
but another
dead vampire.

846
01:11:33,611 --> 01:11:35,155
You're an idiot.
You know that?

847
01:11:35,613 --> 01:11:38,324
I came down here
offering you an easy way out,

848
01:11:38,783 --> 01:11:41,703
and you spit it right back
in my fuckin' face.

849
01:11:42,162 --> 01:11:43,413
Careful.

850
01:11:47,834 --> 01:11:50,253
What do I care?

851
01:11:50,712 --> 01:11:52,630
They're nothing
but cattle...

852
01:11:53,089 --> 01:11:54,507
just like you said.

853
01:11:54,966 --> 01:11:57,552
If you wanna take
the hard road, be my guest, pal,

854
01:11:58,011 --> 01:12:00,513
but I promise you
by the time this is over,

855
01:12:00,972 --> 01:12:03,975
you're gonna wish they never
cut you from your mother's...

856
01:12:13,443 --> 01:12:14,778
aah!

857
01:12:38,843 --> 01:12:40,053
Go home.

858
01:12:43,473 --> 01:12:44,182
It was simple.

859
01:12:44,641 --> 01:12:46,601
Why do vampires
need to drink blood?

860
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:48,978
'Cause their own blood
can't sustain haemoglobin.

861
01:12:49,437 --> 01:12:50,814
Right. So it's
a genetic defect,

862
01:12:51,272 --> 01:12:52,023
just like
haemolytic anaemia.

863
01:12:52,482 --> 01:12:54,609
That means that
we have to treat it

864
01:12:55,068 --> 01:12:55,902
with gene therapy,

865
01:12:56,361 --> 01:12:58,321
rewrite the victim's DNA
with a retrovirus.

866
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:01,074
They've been using it
on sickle cell anaemia.

867
01:13:01,533 --> 01:13:02,659
Are you sure
that's safe?

868
01:13:03,118 --> 01:13:04,119
I have no idea,

869
01:13:04,577 --> 01:13:07,038
but I don't have
a choice, do I?

870
01:13:08,665 --> 01:13:10,542
You actually think
this could work?

871
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,460
On me...

872
01:13:12,919 --> 01:13:14,212
yes.

873
01:13:14,671 --> 01:13:16,840
On Blade,
I'm not so sure.

874
01:13:17,298 --> 01:13:18,508
See, he didn't
contract vampirism

875
01:13:18,967 --> 01:13:20,427
from a bite
like I did.

876
01:13:20,885 --> 01:13:22,053
He was born with it.

877
01:13:22,512 --> 01:13:24,180
It's... it's part
of his DNA.

878
01:13:24,639 --> 01:13:27,142
I'm sure I can cure
his thirst,

879
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,810
but it’s gonna
take time.

880
01:13:29,269 --> 01:13:31,229
Ah, we're out of time.

881
01:13:31,688 --> 01:13:34,023
You saw what was
on that disc.

882
01:13:38,737 --> 01:13:40,196
Damn.

883
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,408
Get out of here.

884
01:14:08,183 --> 01:14:10,435
I said get out of here!

885
01:14:16,107 --> 01:14:17,192
Nice place.

886
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:19,861
Took us a while
to find it!

887
01:14:27,118 --> 01:14:28,661
Bite me
and get it over with.

888
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,955
I ain't gonna bite you.

889
01:14:44,427 --> 01:14:45,428
Do your thing.

890
01:14:57,857 --> 01:14:59,025
Whistler.

891
01:15:59,502 --> 01:16:00,503
Ohh.

892
01:16:06,676 --> 01:16:09,095
Frost took her.

893
01:16:16,811 --> 01:16:18,271
Listen to me.

894
01:16:21,316 --> 01:16:22,484
The disc.

895
01:16:23,818 --> 01:16:25,028
He decoded it.

896
01:16:25,487 --> 01:16:28,281
Frost is trying to...

897
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:32,202
trigger a fuckin'
vampire apocalypse.

898
01:16:34,329 --> 01:16:36,331
There's some kind of...

899
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:39,918
Vampire God he's trying
to resurrect.

900
01:16:41,544 --> 01:16:43,088
La Magra.

901
01:16:46,466 --> 01:16:48,218
You're the key.

902
01:16:49,719 --> 01:16:51,429
He needs
your blood.

903
01:16:55,225 --> 01:16:57,352
The blood
of the daywalker.

904
01:16:59,979 --> 01:17:02,607
You're the chosen one.

905
01:17:06,194 --> 01:17:07,445
Listen to me, Blade.

906
01:17:08,988 --> 01:17:10,532
You can't
go after him.

907
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:12,283
Bullshit.

908
01:17:12,742 --> 01:17:14,577
If Frost gets
his hands on you,

909
01:17:15,036 --> 01:17:17,455
it's all over.

910
01:17:20,417 --> 01:17:23,086
There'll be armies
of the motherfuckers.

911
01:17:25,839 --> 01:17:26,840
Shit.

912
01:17:31,177 --> 01:17:33,179
You're gonna have
to finish me off.

913
01:17:33,638 --> 01:17:36,933
Don't want me
coming back.

914
01:17:38,893 --> 01:17:40,770
We can treat
the wounds.

915
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,857
It's too far gone.

916
01:17:44,315 --> 01:17:46,443
You know that.

917
01:17:49,779 --> 01:17:52,449
Give me your gun.

918
01:17:53,867 --> 01:17:55,452
No.

919
01:17:56,619 --> 01:17:59,289
Give me
the god-damn gun.

920
01:18:24,397 --> 01:18:25,356
Now walk away,

921
01:18:25,815 --> 01:18:28,109
you stupid
son of a bitch.

922
01:18:32,906 --> 01:18:35,241
Walk the fuck away.

923
01:18:56,262 --> 01:18:57,180
By the time you watch this,

924
01:18:57,639 --> 01:18:58,890
your friend Whistler
should be dead.

925
01:18:59,349 --> 01:19:00,809
If it makes any
difference to you,

926
01:19:01,267 --> 01:19:02,519
he put up
quite a fight.

927
01:19:02,977 --> 01:19:05,647
You can find us
at the Edgewood Towers.

928
01:20:43,953 --> 01:20:44,913
You seem a bit...

929
01:20:45,372 --> 01:20:46,039
tense.

930
01:20:46,498 --> 01:20:48,083
A bit pent-up maybe,

931
01:20:48,541 --> 01:20:50,043
like you need to
release something.

932
01:20:51,127 --> 01:20:51,795
You know?

933
01:20:52,253 --> 01:20:53,338
Blade not...

934
01:20:54,631 --> 01:20:56,883
givin' it to you
maybe.

935
01:20:57,967 --> 01:20:59,010
I don't know.
I just...

936
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:02,472
I see such
a beautiful woman.

937
01:21:04,182 --> 01:21:05,433
Great skin.

938
01:21:08,228 --> 01:21:09,938
I'd like to see you
happy, that's all.

939
01:21:10,397 --> 01:21:13,566
Is this the part where
you offer to turn me?

940
01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:17,237
Well, it's either that
or a body bag.

941
01:21:17,695 --> 01:21:18,905
Go ahead.

942
01:21:19,364 --> 01:21:20,532
Bite me.

943
01:21:20,990 --> 01:21:23,576
I'll just cure myself.

944
01:21:24,035 --> 01:21:24,994
I did it before,

945
01:21:25,453 --> 01:21:26,746
and I can do it again.

946
01:21:27,205 --> 01:21:28,581
There is no cure,
baby.

947
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,166
There is if you've
been bit,

948
01:21:30,625 --> 01:21:33,920
if you were once human.

949
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:40,343
How'd you get
that scar, Deacon?

950
01:21:40,802 --> 01:21:41,928
A born vampire

951
01:21:42,387 --> 01:21:44,723
would have the power
to regenerate from birth.

952
01:21:45,181 --> 01:21:47,976
You must've gotten scarred
before you were turned.

953
01:21:48,435 --> 01:21:49,394
Isn't that right?

954
01:21:49,853 --> 01:21:52,856
Vampires like you
aren't a species.

955
01:21:53,314 --> 01:21:56,025
You're just... infected,
a virus...

956
01:21:56,484 --> 01:21:58,111
a sexually transmitted
disease.

957
01:21:58,570 --> 01:21:59,612
I'll tell you
what we are, sister.

958
01:22:00,071 --> 01:22:02,240
We're the top of
the fuckin' food chain.

959
01:22:02,699 --> 01:22:04,367
The Blood God's coming.
And after tonight,

960
01:22:04,826 --> 01:22:06,369
you people
are fuckin' history.

961
01:22:07,954 --> 01:22:09,080
He's a hurricane,

962
01:22:09,539 --> 01:22:11,166
an act of God.

963
01:22:11,624 --> 01:22:12,959
Anyone caught
in his path

964
01:22:13,418 --> 01:22:14,586
will instantly
be turned.

965
01:22:16,504 --> 01:22:17,797
Everyone you've
ever known,

966
01:22:18,256 --> 01:22:21,009
everyone you've ever
fucking loved.

967
01:22:21,468 --> 01:22:23,053
It won't matter
who's pureblood

968
01:22:23,511 --> 01:22:24,721
and who's not.

969
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:27,807
How are you gonna cure
the whole fuckin' world?

970
01:22:29,559 --> 01:22:31,102
Hmm?

971
01:22:34,564 --> 01:22:36,524
And Blade's blood
is the key.

972
01:22:37,067 --> 01:22:38,735
We got an intruder.

973
01:23:07,806 --> 01:23:08,681
Deac, I don't think
you understand.

974
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:10,016
I mean, this dude
is fuckin' bad. What?

975
01:23:10,475 --> 01:23:12,143
He's, like, he had
20 guys around him...

976
01:23:12,602 --> 01:23:14,020
and he's got shit
he throws at you...

977
01:23:14,479 --> 01:23:15,647
Yeah, the swords.

978
01:23:16,106 --> 01:23:17,023
Throw it in the air,
catch it underneath.

979
01:23:17,482 --> 01:23:18,733
Yeah. Shut the fuck up!

980
01:23:19,192 --> 01:23:20,151
There's no
intruder where we are.

981
01:23:20,610 --> 01:23:22,028
Look, make it happen,
all right?

982
01:23:22,487 --> 01:23:23,696
It's one guy on foot.

983
01:23:28,451 --> 01:23:30,078
That's him!
Get him!

984
01:23:49,556 --> 01:23:51,099
Why am I hearing
gunfire? Huh?

985
01:23:51,558 --> 01:23:53,893
Did I tell anybody
to start shooting?

986
01:23:54,352 --> 01:23:55,353
I need him alive.

987
01:23:55,812 --> 01:23:56,896
No!

988
01:23:59,524 --> 01:24:01,484
Please!

989
01:24:01,943 --> 01:24:03,153
I just work for them!

990
01:24:05,488 --> 01:24:06,948
Jesus Christ.
Lock this place down.

991
01:24:07,407 --> 01:24:08,408
Yes, sir!

992
01:24:45,153 --> 01:24:47,322
Aah!

993
01:24:47,781 --> 01:24:49,949
Aieee!
Aah!

994
01:25:55,765 --> 01:25:57,434
Eric?

995
01:26:08,486 --> 01:26:10,155
But you died.

996
01:26:11,489 --> 01:26:13,533
I came back, Eric.

997
01:26:13,992 --> 01:26:15,285
That very same night...

998
01:26:17,078 --> 01:26:19,664
when Deacon welcomed me
into his arms.

999
01:26:27,589 --> 01:26:29,507
Uhh!

1000
01:26:36,681 --> 01:26:39,142
Jesus Christ. I thought
you'd be happy.

1001
01:26:39,601 --> 01:26:40,602
You're finally being
reunited with your mother,

1002
01:26:41,061 --> 01:26:42,395
and you act like this?

1003
01:26:44,105 --> 01:26:46,024
Blade, give it up.
It's over.

1004
01:26:46,483 --> 01:26:48,193
She belongs to me,
buddy.

1005
01:26:48,651 --> 01:26:49,652
Uh! Uhh!

1006
01:26:51,613 --> 01:26:52,739
Don't look so surprised.

1007
01:26:53,198 --> 01:26:54,657
You spent your whole life

1008
01:26:55,116 --> 01:26:57,494
looking for the vampire
who bit your mother.

1009
01:26:57,952 --> 01:26:59,871
Well, here I am.

1010
01:27:02,165 --> 01:27:03,083
Who would ever guess

1011
01:27:03,541 --> 01:27:05,627
you'd survive
your mother's death?

1012
01:27:06,086 --> 01:27:07,003
But you did.

1013
01:27:07,462 --> 01:27:08,671
And here we are...

1014
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:11,466
one big happy
fuckin' family.

1015
01:27:22,852 --> 01:27:24,604
I need my serum.

1016
01:27:27,315 --> 01:27:28,274
Maybe when we
get outta this,

1017
01:27:28,733 --> 01:27:30,527
I'll take that
miracle cure of yours.

1018
01:27:30,985 --> 01:27:32,529
There's one catch.

1019
01:27:36,491 --> 01:27:38,076
If it works,

1020
01:27:38,535 --> 01:27:39,452
you'll lose
your strength

1021
01:27:39,911 --> 01:27:43,873
and your ability
to regenerate.

1022
01:27:44,332 --> 01:27:46,334
You'll be
completely human.

1023
01:28:07,522 --> 01:28:08,565
Uhh!

1024
01:28:48,229 --> 01:28:50,607
Blade, Karen,

1025
01:28:51,066 --> 01:28:52,567
glad you could make it.

1026
01:28:53,026 --> 01:28:55,320
Hey, man. Thanks
for the shades.

1027
01:28:56,696 --> 01:28:58,740
Our ancestors
called this place

1028
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:01,409
the Temple
of Eternal Night.

1029
01:29:04,537 --> 01:29:06,039
Nice, isn't it?

1030
01:29:06,498 --> 01:29:09,000
Apparently, these geniuses
forgot it ever existed.

1031
01:29:09,459 --> 01:29:11,795
Fortunately for us...

1032
01:29:12,253 --> 01:29:13,254
I'm what you
might call a...

1033
01:29:13,713 --> 01:29:16,299
student of history.

1034
01:29:29,604 --> 01:29:31,689
Why are we here?

1035
01:29:33,149 --> 01:29:37,320
This temple was built
for one glorious moment...

1036
01:29:37,779 --> 01:29:41,074
this night,
for the Blood God.

1037
01:29:49,416 --> 01:29:50,625
Thanks.

1038
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:57,424
Let's see
this sword of yours.

1039
01:30:00,969 --> 01:30:02,095
Well.

1040
01:30:02,554 --> 01:30:03,263
Titanium, right?

1041
01:30:03,722 --> 01:30:05,724
Acid-etched?

1042
01:30:07,517 --> 01:30:10,270
I'll get used
to a weapon like this.

1043
01:30:15,859 --> 01:30:16,568
What?

1044
01:30:17,026 --> 01:30:19,487
You look surprised.

1045
01:30:19,946 --> 01:30:21,156
I told you, Blade,

1046
01:30:21,614 --> 01:30:23,742
I know everything
about you.

1047
01:30:24,826 --> 01:30:25,869
Hold out your arm,
Quinn.

1048
01:30:26,327 --> 01:30:27,078
Why, man?

1049
01:30:27,537 --> 01:30:28,204
These are... they're,
like, all better.

1050
01:30:28,663 --> 01:30:29,581
Hold out your arm.

1051
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:31,041
Now.

1052
01:30:35,003 --> 01:30:36,046
Deac, l...

1053
01:30:41,259 --> 01:30:42,260
Just kidding.

1054
01:30:44,554 --> 01:30:46,181
Ha ha ha ha!
He was fuckin'
with me.

1055
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:47,932
He was, like,
fuckin'...

1056
01:30:48,391 --> 01:30:48,975
Blade.

1057
01:30:49,434 --> 01:30:51,394
Blade.

1058
01:30:51,853 --> 01:30:52,520
He can't hear you,
honey.

1059
01:30:52,979 --> 01:30:54,522
The thirst has
got him now.

1060
01:31:01,321 --> 01:31:02,113
What do we have here?

1061
01:31:02,572 --> 01:31:04,949
The precious serum.

1062
01:31:05,408 --> 01:31:08,787
Mm. How long's it been
since you shot up?

1063
01:31:09,245 --> 01:31:11,623
12, 13 hours maybe?

1064
01:31:12,082 --> 01:31:14,000
I bet you're just
dying for a drink,

1065
01:31:14,459 --> 01:31:15,585
aren’t you?

1066
01:31:18,088 --> 01:31:19,297
What's it feel like?

1067
01:31:21,257 --> 01:31:22,801
Is your blood on fire?

1068
01:31:23,259 --> 01:31:25,303
Try some.

1069
01:31:25,762 --> 01:31:28,014
You might like it.

1070
01:31:28,473 --> 01:31:30,517
Thanks, but I prefer
the real thing.

1071
01:31:30,975 --> 01:31:32,894
In any event,

1072
01:31:33,353 --> 01:31:35,438
I don't think you'll be
needing these any more.

1073
01:31:42,821 --> 01:31:44,197
It's a shame, you know?

1074
01:31:45,490 --> 01:31:46,825
When I think of what
you've become,

1075
01:31:47,283 --> 01:31:49,536
what you should
have become.

1076
01:31:49,994 --> 01:31:51,579
I guess
I don't blame you.

1077
01:31:52,038 --> 01:31:53,373
I mean, with everything
that's happened,

1078
01:31:53,832 --> 01:31:54,874
it's the human
side of you

1079
01:31:55,333 --> 01:31:56,626
that's made you weak.

1080
01:31:57,085 --> 01:31:58,253
You should've listened
to your blood.

1081
01:31:58,712 --> 01:32:00,630
Say what you want,

1082
01:32:01,089 --> 01:32:03,883
but I promise you,
you'll be dead by dawn.

1083
01:32:04,342 --> 01:32:05,510
Ooh.

1084
01:32:08,179 --> 01:32:10,140
Get him outta here.

1085
01:32:14,519 --> 01:32:16,521
Get these fucks
downstairs. Now.

1086
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:18,398
Come on. Let's go.

1087
01:32:18,857 --> 01:32:20,608
Let's go.

1088
01:32:24,571 --> 01:32:25,488
Don't worry,
sweetheart.

1089
01:32:25,947 --> 01:32:26,698
We haven't
forgotten about you.

1090
01:32:27,157 --> 01:32:28,074
Oh, no, baby.

1091
01:32:28,533 --> 01:32:31,494
We got something real
special planned for you.

1092
01:32:32,746 --> 01:32:34,039
That surfer boy
had a nice ass.

1093
01:32:34,497 --> 01:32:35,415
I sucked him dry.

1094
01:32:35,874 --> 01:32:37,250
And you'd figure
he'd turn, man.

1095
01:32:37,709 --> 01:32:38,626
Yeah, but he didn't
turn, did he?

1096
01:32:39,085 --> 01:32:40,045
No. He turned into
some kinda zombie.

1097
01:32:40,503 --> 01:32:42,005
It happens
sometimes, cutie.

1098
01:32:43,923 --> 01:32:44,591
He was fuckin'
tripped out.

1099
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:46,009
Pathetic.

1100
01:32:46,468 --> 01:32:48,136
Yeah. These guys
are complete scum, man.

1101
01:32:48,595 --> 01:32:49,512
They'll eat anything...

1102
01:32:49,971 --> 01:32:53,641
animals, rodents, corpses,
and sometimes...

1103
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:56,019
They'll even
eat vampires.

1104
01:32:56,478 --> 01:32:57,645
That's a plus.

1105
01:32:58,104 --> 01:32:59,147
And bearing that
all in mind,

1106
01:32:59,606 --> 01:33:01,441
I'd like you to meet
an old friend of yours.

1107
01:33:03,234 --> 01:33:04,444
Uh!

1108
01:33:06,112 --> 01:33:07,113
Uh!

1109
01:33:07,572 --> 01:33:08,239
It's too bad.

1110
01:33:08,698 --> 01:33:11,076
I kinda liked her.

1111
01:33:11,534 --> 01:33:12,702
What a waste.

1112
01:33:34,432 --> 01:33:36,267
I don't know what's
happening to me.

1113
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,020
No pulse.

1114
01:33:39,479 --> 01:33:40,313
And, of course,

1115
01:33:40,772 --> 01:33:42,565
there's the question
of lividity.

1116
01:33:44,359 --> 01:33:45,568
Curtis?

1117
01:33:47,654 --> 01:33:48,988
Ahh.

1118
01:33:49,447 --> 01:33:51,449
Karen?

1119
01:33:52,617 --> 01:33:53,660
Karen.

1120
01:33:54,953 --> 01:33:57,122
I never thought
I would see you again.

1121
01:33:57,580 --> 01:33:59,082
Tell me, Karen,

1122
01:33:59,541 --> 01:34:01,584
do you ever have
second thoughts about us?

1123
01:34:19,811 --> 01:34:21,146
Karen!

1124
01:34:21,604 --> 01:34:23,565
Karen!

1125
01:34:24,023 --> 01:34:25,275
Karen!

1126
01:34:26,609 --> 01:34:28,611
Karen!

1127
01:34:29,070 --> 01:34:30,321
Karen.

1128
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:32,866
Karen!

1129
01:35:37,764 --> 01:35:39,349
Poor child.

1130
01:35:41,142 --> 01:35:42,685
You're so sick.

1131
01:35:44,104 --> 01:35:45,855
So thirsty.

1132
01:35:46,314 --> 01:35:48,483
Don't touch me.

1133
01:35:51,069 --> 01:35:53,571
Eric, look at me.

1134
01:35:54,030 --> 01:35:56,366
Vampires are
my people now.

1135
01:35:56,825 --> 01:35:59,119
I'm one of them.

1136
01:35:59,577 --> 01:36:00,912
Can't be.

1137
01:36:02,455 --> 01:36:04,165
Yes, it can.

1138
01:36:06,584 --> 01:36:09,045
Try to understand,
Eric.

1139
01:36:10,213 --> 01:36:13,425
Your mother died
a longtime ago.

1140
01:36:15,844 --> 01:36:17,262
I've hunted...

1141
01:36:18,930 --> 01:36:20,390
I've killed...

1142
01:36:22,767 --> 01:36:24,561
and I've enjoyed it.

1143
01:36:26,271 --> 01:36:27,439
Haven't you?

1144
01:36:29,190 --> 01:36:30,608
I know you have.

1145
01:36:32,902 --> 01:36:34,070
Sooner or later,

1146
01:36:34,529 --> 01:36:36,573
the thirst
always wins.

1147
01:37:21,117 --> 01:37:22,285
Come on.

1148
01:37:29,084 --> 01:37:30,251
Spread them out.

1149
01:37:31,461 --> 01:37:33,963
One on each glyph,
under the towers.

1150
01:37:34,422 --> 01:37:36,174
Make it perfect.

1151
01:38:14,254 --> 01:38:15,547
Yeah.

1152
01:38:16,756 --> 01:38:18,425
Bring the elevator up.

1153
01:38:57,881 --> 01:38:59,883
You stupid girl.

1154
01:39:00,341 --> 01:39:01,051
What do you think
is Going to happen?

1155
01:39:01,509 --> 01:39:02,093
La Magra?

1156
01:39:02,552 --> 01:39:03,595
The Blood God?

1157
01:39:04,054 --> 01:39:05,263
That's nothing more
than a fairy tale

1158
01:39:05,722 --> 01:39:07,390
for pretty
little vampires.

1159
01:39:07,849 --> 01:39:08,683
Then why are you
sweating, pureblood?

1160
01:39:09,142 --> 01:39:12,562
You're afraid we're
gonna steal your soul,

1161
01:39:13,021 --> 01:39:15,148
your pureblood spirit.

1162
01:39:15,607 --> 01:39:17,192
You should be.

1163
01:39:17,650 --> 01:39:18,902
Read the prophecy.

1164
01:39:19,361 --> 01:39:20,320
It's time you fucks

1165
01:39:20,779 --> 01:39:22,489
contributed something
to the cause.

1166
01:39:26,493 --> 01:39:27,702
Even if Frost is right,

1167
01:39:28,161 --> 01:39:30,830
you really think
he cares about you?

1168
01:39:31,289 --> 01:39:32,082
You're gonna die,

1169
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:33,792
just like
the rest of us.

1170
01:39:34,250 --> 01:39:35,251
Waah!

1171
01:39:59,317 --> 01:40:00,443
Blade.

1172
01:40:09,703 --> 01:40:13,039
Tonight, the age of man
comes to an end.

1173
01:40:13,498 --> 01:40:14,708
No more compromises.

1174
01:40:15,166 --> 01:40:17,419
We're gonna be gods.

1175
01:40:19,087 --> 01:40:19,879
Of course we are.

1176
01:40:20,338 --> 01:40:23,174
Yeah!

1177
01:40:23,633 --> 01:40:24,634
I'm gonna be naughty.

1178
01:40:25,093 --> 01:40:26,970
I'm gonna be a naughty
Vampire God.

1179
01:40:27,429 --> 01:40:28,430
Ha ha ha!

1180
01:40:35,562 --> 01:40:37,021
Gotta stop...

1181
01:40:38,648 --> 01:40:39,691
stop...

1182
01:40:40,150 --> 01:40:41,860
Save your strength.

1183
01:40:42,318 --> 01:40:43,319
Blue.

1184
01:40:44,654 --> 01:40:46,072
You're hypovolemic.

1185
01:40:46,531 --> 01:40:47,824
You're bleeding
to death.

1186
01:40:48,283 --> 01:40:49,868
Need...

1187
01:40:50,326 --> 01:40:51,161
serum.

1188
01:41:09,429 --> 01:41:10,430
Blade.

1189
01:41:12,265 --> 01:41:14,225
Blade.

1190
01:41:16,478 --> 01:41:17,562
Listen to me.

1191
01:41:19,230 --> 01:41:21,566
I want you to take
some of my blood.

1192
01:41:23,443 --> 01:41:24,819
No.

1193
01:41:27,155 --> 01:41:28,323
No.

1194
01:41:29,491 --> 01:41:31,826
Look, just do it.

1195
01:41:57,519 --> 01:41:58,603
Is everybody thirsty?

1196
01:41:59,062 --> 01:42:02,524
I hope you're all
very fucking thirsty.

1197
01:42:21,084 --> 01:42:23,211
Ohh...

1198
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:24,754
don’t stop.

1199
01:42:27,924 --> 01:42:29,008
Don’t stop.

1200
01:42:34,556 --> 01:42:35,557
Don’t stop.

1201
01:42:50,155 --> 01:42:51,573
Don’t stop.

1202
01:43:04,461 --> 01:43:06,504
Aah!

1203
01:43:43,708 --> 01:43:45,335
How was it?

1204
01:43:46,628 --> 01:43:47,754
Aah!

1205
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:55,929
Aah!

1206
01:43:56,388 --> 01:43:57,931
Aah!

1207
01:43:58,390 --> 01:44:01,142
Aah!

1208
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:08,817
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1209
01:44:11,486 --> 01:44:13,613
Uhh!

1210
01:44:21,079 --> 01:44:22,497
Aah!

1211
01:44:44,686 --> 01:44:46,312
Aah!

1212
01:44:50,567 --> 01:44:51,735
Aah!

1213
01:44:56,364 --> 01:44:57,741
Eric...

1214
01:44:58,825 --> 01:45:00,410
I'm your mother.

1215
01:45:02,662 --> 01:45:05,081
You wouldn't hurt
your mother...

1216
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:06,541
would you?

1217
01:45:09,335 --> 01:45:10,336
Come here.

1218
01:45:14,799 --> 01:45:16,968
I must release you.

1219
01:45:27,979 --> 01:45:28,980
Fuck!

1220
01:45:30,523 --> 01:45:32,609
Aah!

1221
01:45:47,624 --> 01:45:48,625
Aah!

1222
01:45:55,423 --> 01:45:56,424
Aah!

1223
01:46:26,246 --> 01:46:27,038
Uhh!

1224
01:46:27,497 --> 01:46:28,915
Unh!

1225
01:46:29,374 --> 01:46:30,375
Unh!

1226
01:46:34,003 --> 01:46:34,963
Deacon?

1227
01:46:35,422 --> 01:46:36,589
Not anymore.

1228
01:46:52,522 --> 01:46:54,190
Frost!

1229
01:46:54,649 --> 01:46:55,316
Kill him.

1230
01:46:55,775 --> 01:46:57,402
Wait! I owe you, man.

1231
01:46:57,861 --> 01:46:59,320
I got two new hands, Blade.

1232
01:46:59,779 --> 01:47:02,115
I don't know which one
to use to kill you with!

1233
01:47:02,574 --> 01:47:04,034
Aah!

1234
01:47:16,588 --> 01:47:18,757
Yaah!

1235
01:47:22,552 --> 01:47:24,387
Frost.

1236
01:47:26,431 --> 01:47:27,807
Yaah!

1237
01:47:41,404 --> 01:47:43,365
I got struck
by lightning

1238
01:47:44,908 --> 01:47:46,076
Aah!

1239
01:47:46,534 --> 01:47:47,994
Aah!

1240
01:48:10,350 --> 01:48:11,684
Aah!

1241
01:48:46,219 --> 01:48:48,430
I'm really Going to
enjoy this now. Haah!

1242
01:49:13,371 --> 01:49:14,914
Yaah!

1243
01:49:21,129 --> 01:49:22,964
Aah!

1244
01:49:36,978 --> 01:49:38,563
Hey, Blade.

1245
01:49:40,523 --> 01:49:42,484
Let's do this.

1246
01:50:25,568 --> 01:50:27,028
Aah!

1247
01:50:27,487 --> 01:50:29,447
Aah! Aah!

1248
01:50:36,121 --> 01:50:37,872
You're too late, Blade.

1249
01:50:57,434 --> 01:50:58,560
My turn.

1250
01:51:25,170 --> 01:51:25,962
Look at you.

1251
01:51:26,421 --> 01:51:27,672
You're a little bitch.

1252
01:51:29,549 --> 01:51:31,051
What, your serum?

1253
01:51:31,509 --> 01:51:33,011
It can't help you
now, stud.

1254
01:51:40,435 --> 01:51:41,478
Nice shot.

1255
01:52:02,540 --> 01:52:04,918
Aah!

1256
01:52:07,212 --> 01:52:08,922
Aah!

1257
01:52:09,381 --> 01:52:10,924
Aah! Aah!

1258
01:52:13,718 --> 01:52:14,469
Some motherfuckers

1259
01:52:14,928 --> 01:52:17,847
are always trying
to ice-skate uphill.

1260
01:52:24,020 --> 01:52:25,021
Uhh!

1261
01:52:34,572 --> 01:52:39,577
Aah!

1262
01:52:49,796 --> 01:52:51,339
Blade!

1263
01:52:59,514 --> 01:53:01,433
Let's get out of here.

1264
01:53:37,469 --> 01:53:39,012
I need to get back
to the lab

1265
01:53:39,471 --> 01:53:42,057
if I'm going to cure you.

1266
01:53:42,515 --> 01:53:44,059
It's not over.

1267
01:53:44,517 --> 01:53:45,977
You keep your cure.

1268
01:53:47,103 --> 01:53:48,563
There's still
a war going on,

1269
01:53:49,022 --> 01:53:51,024
and I have a job to do.

1270
01:53:51,483 --> 01:53:53,234
You want to help,

1271
01:53:53,693 --> 01:53:56,029
make me a better serum.

1272
01:54:50,375 --> 01:54:51,292
Uhh!
