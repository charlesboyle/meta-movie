1
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,265
Between the years
when the oceans drank Atlantis

2
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:53,688
and the rise of the sons of Aryas,
there was an age undreamed of

3
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,899
when shining kingdoms
lay spread across the world.

4
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,813
Then came the dark empire of Acheron,

5
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,491
where cruel Necromancers
sought secrets of resurrection.

6
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:11,038
They crafted a mask from the bones of kings

7
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:15,084
and awakened its wrath
with the pure blood of their daughters.

8
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:19,372
The mask summoned spirits
of unspeakable evil,

9
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:23,129
giving them power
no mortal men should possess.

10
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,719
Acheron enslaved the civilized world.

11
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:40,560
Only the Barbarian tribes
were left to rise up against them.

12
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,781
The mask was shattered and Acheron fell.

13
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,997
Each tribe kept a single shard

14
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,622
so that no man might attempt
to join them back together

15
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:02,081
and drive the world
once again into chaos and ruin.

16
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:08,379
Their pieces were scattered across the land
and remained hidden for ages.

17
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:16,187
But prophecy spoke of a man who would
some day try to reassemble the mask

18
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,480
and rule the world.

19
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:26,113
So came the dawn of Hyborian Age,
a time both bleak and brutal.

20
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,945
And so came a child.

21
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,611
Born of battle.

22
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,600
Fialla!

23
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:06,895
Fialla.

24
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,944
Do not speak, my love. Do not speak.

25
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,526
I must see my child before I die.

26
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,493
Name your son.

27
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,163
His name

28
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,328
is Conan.

29
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,736
Slow down, Conan!

30
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:36,424
When a Cimmerian feels thirst,
it is the thirst for blood.

31
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:43,643
When he feels cold,
it is the cold edge of steel.

32
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,106
But the courage
of the Cimmerian is tempered.

33
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,652
He neither fears death
nor rushes foolishly to meet it.

34
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,697
But to be a Cimmerian warrior,

35
00:05:55,772 --> 00:06:00,323
you must have both cunning and
balance, as well as speed and strength.

36
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,495
Conan.

37
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,713
I gave you chores, boy.

38
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,415
Finished, Father.

39
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,842
First to circle the hills
and return the egg unbroken

40
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,894
earns the right to fight with the warriors.

41
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,367
Well, by Crom, boy,
what are you waiting for?

42
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,549
We go back.

43
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,219
Conan!

44
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,369
Make way. Make way.

45
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,818
Come. Time to forge a blade.

46
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,718
This sword we make will be yours one day.

47
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:07,607
But before you wield it,
you must understand it.

48
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,942
The sword must bend or it will break.

49
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,360
It must be tempered.

50
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:28,540
What is most important
when forging a blade, fire or ice?

51
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:29,715
Fire.

52
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,341
Ice?

53
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,297
Are you certain?

54
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:52,064
Fire and ice together.

55
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,904
This is the mystery of steel.

56
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,879
You're still all fire, boy.

57
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:22,723
No. Slow down. Find your footing.

58
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,902
Enough!

59
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,502
You're not ready for this sword.

60
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,214
Fire!

61
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,725
Fire!

62
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,377
- Father!
- Conan!

63
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,856
Father!

64
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:37,978
Conan!

65
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,604
Die!

66
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,980
Father!

67
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,473
Barbarian.

68
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,352
There's no shame in kneeling before me.

69
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,034
Each of these brave warriors

70
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,949
has surrendered, left their lands,
sworn allegiance to me.

71
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:40,124
They do so because
they know one day I will be a god.

72
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,913
One day...

73
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:49,053
the other clans of Cimmeria will gather
for vengeance, and then god or no god,

74
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,389
you will fall.

75
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,097
You know why I'm here.

76
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,401
One piece is missing from the mask.

77
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,235
You know its power. Give it to me now...

78
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,744
or die and I'll find it for myself.

79
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,170
I prefer death.

80
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,425
Oh, my nose!

81
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,320
No!

82
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,298
This is your son.

83
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,887
I like him.

84
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,307
Come here, my daughter.

85
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:07,351
Father, I sense the bone shard is close.

86
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,186
Will you find it for me, Marique?

87
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,112
Barbarian, your son has courage.

88
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,367
But my daughter has talents as well.

89
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,123
Find it, Marique.

90
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,493
These Cimmerians, they do not pray.

91
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,370
This is their church.

92
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,713
This is what they worship.

93
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,292
It will be here!

94
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,917
The shard. She found the bone shard.

95
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,689
Your mother would be proud.

96
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,191
- Remo.
- Yeah?

97
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:42,495
Gather the men. Burn everything.

98
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,696
But, Zym!

99
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,781
Not the boy. Not yet.

100
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:50,078
Not yet. Look what he did to my face!

101
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,800
Now, how do I punish you, huh?

102
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,712
You fear not pain, nor death.

103
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,319
Father! No!

104
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,496
Father!

105
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,537
No!

106
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,334
Worse than death, eh, Cimmerian?

107
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,798
Watching your son die.

108
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,600
Because he loves you.

109
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,627
It is complete.

110
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,173
Marique, we're halfway there.

111
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:21,043
When we find the pureblood, your mother,

112
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,006
my beloved, will return.

113
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,062
The mask is complete!

114
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:54,327
Conan, you cannot save me.

115
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,752
Let go of the chain, boy.

116
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,597
- I'm not afraid to die!
- Nor I.

117
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,350
I love you, Son.

118
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,110
No! No!

119
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:40,524
Conan left Cimmeria
and wandered the edges of the world,

120
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,694
slaying, thieving, surviving,

121
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:50,577
storming the high walls of Venarium
and prowling the dark seas among pirates.

122
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:55,741
But the nameless man who slaughtered
his village and killed his father

123
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,329
remained in shadow.

124
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:18,513
These are common slavers, Conan.
Not the man you seek. Why attack?

125
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,643
No man should live in chains.

126
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,967
Fight!

127
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,793
Stay and fight,
you pink-bellied motherless goat-lovers!

128
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,826
Go. You're free.

129
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:08,001
Go. Your masters are dead.
You are no longer slaves.

130
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,675
But you've taken all our food,
all our weapons.

131
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,803
Where would you have us go?

132
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,937
Come on.

133
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,855
We sail to Messantia.

134
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,663
Come on.

135
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,289
Call it.

136
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:55,920
Come on, old man.

137
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,228
I win!

138
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,241
I still win.

139
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,880
When I first met him,
he was no bigger than you.

140
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:37,260
Just a scrawny little rat
picking pockets in Zamora.

141
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,880
Even so,

142
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:44,848
it was he who stole the Elephant's Heart

143
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,224
and slew the sorcerer Yara.

144
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,059
Come.

145
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:00,530
Hey, mama. Need more mead.

146
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,119
Who's next?

147
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:21,089
Guards! There. And check there.

148
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,589
Hey. Why are they looking for you?

149
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,794
No. No, no, no. No, wait.
You don't understand.

150
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:07,226
They'll be happy to take us both to prison
if you don't let go!

151
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,474
Maybe I wanna go to prison.

152
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,352
You take the one in the middle?

153
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:14,433
Me?

154
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,439
- You.
- I'll take him.

155
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,161
I am your prisoner.

156
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,880
You're calm for somebody
who's about to die.

157
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,302
Move!

158
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,414
Where's the captain?

159
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:16,583
The hill ape can speak.
The captain is currently occupied.

160
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:24,090
Don't worry. Everyone can get their chance.

161
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:40,735
Hey!

162
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,279
Stop him!

163
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,828
Come here!

164
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,042
Where is the captain of the guard?

165
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,425
His door's sealed from within.
He can only open it for me.

166
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,809
Guards! The door!

167
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,693
All right.

168
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,030
What?

169
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,160
Guards! Guards!

170
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:58,351
You remember me?

171
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,648
Who are you?

172
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,518
I'm the one who made you pretty.

173
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,192
You can't do this! Do you know who I am?

174
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,595
Where is the man who killed my father?

175
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,048
You seek Khalar Zym?

176
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,393
Zym. No.

177
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:44,602
My people were slain by a common bandit,
not a king.

178
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:48,814
He was a bandit then. He's a legend now.
A Shadow Lord.

179
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,568
A Shadow Lord, huh?

180
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,573
Speak. I will not kill you.

181
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,118
You know the Forbidden Forest?

182
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:05,081
Nothing there but dead bodies
and the animals who feed on them.

183
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,963
Even as we speak,
Khalar leads his legions through the mist.

184
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:11,378
More.

185
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:12,508
Not good enough.

186
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,474
Wait! The forest is large, I know.

187
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,723
But as he returns to his stronghold
at Khor Kalba,

188
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:22,727
he returns by way of the ravine at Shaipur.

189
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,353
That's a perfect place for an ambush.

190
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,810
What does Khalar want there?

191
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:31,319
He's with his witch daughter.
They're searching for a young girl.

192
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,570
A pureblood.

193
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,492
Are you leading me into a trap?

194
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,535
No. I wouldn't lie to you.

195
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,489
He's mad.

196
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:44,040
He's obsessed with Acheronian sorcery.
I hold no loyalty to him.

197
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:50,752
Well, Northerner,
I've upheld my part of the deal.

198
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:58,804
No!

199
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,009
Yes.

200
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,525
By Mitra, what are you doing?

201
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,071
Toasting to our deal.

202
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,914
Hey! Northerner!

203
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,996
Hey, hey, wait for me!

204
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,048
Oh, god!

205
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:33,001
Prisoners of Messantia!

206
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:37,051
The key to your freedom
sits in your captain's gut.

207
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,976
You gave me your word!
You swore you'd spare my life!

208
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,394
I said I would not kill you.

209
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,639
Free yourselves.

210
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,956
Northerner! My name is Ela-Shan.

211
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:06,376
Perhaps you've heard that there is no lock
I cannot break or vault I cannot enter.

212
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:11,251
If you are ever foolish enough
to pursue this man to Khor Kalba,

213
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:14,084
come see me in Argalon
so I can talk you out of it.

214
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,215
Ask anyone you meet there for Ela-Shan!

215
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,196
What do you see in my future,
Master Fassir?

216
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,490
It is unclear.

217
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,656
I see a journey.

218
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:47,792
A man crossing the sands.

219
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:50,913
A knight?

220
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,591
A warrior.

221
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,586
Your paths will merge.

222
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:04,218
He will take you home to your birthplace.

223
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,476
Is that all that you see, Master?

224
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:28,375
The pureblood is close.
I can taste her in the air.

225
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:05,287
There'll be rioting in Messantia for days,
thanks to you.

226
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,282
Khalar Zym.

227
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:10,408
What?

228
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,493
That's the name of the man
who killed my father.

229
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:14,375
Zym?

230
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,381
Do you know who that is?

231
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,633
I am told he's the angel of death.

232
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,921
I leave tonight to pursue him in Shaipur.

233
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:26,099
We can sail as far as the bay
near the Shaipur Outpost.

234
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,718
- You can wait for me there.
- Wait?

235
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,646
I'm not your serving maid.
I will go with you.

236
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:37,027
Not this time, Artus.
This is something I must do alone.

237
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,509
Go to the temple. Go! Go!

238
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,558
Protect the master. Go! Go!

239
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,134
Tamara, come with me.

240
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:41,355
Get into the carriage.

241
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:42,981
No, I want to stay here
and defend our home.

242
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,813
For the sake of your people,
you must leave this place

243
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,816
and go to the monks in Hyrkania.
It is your duty.

244
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:48,824
Do not hesitate and do not waver.

245
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,736
I don't want to leave you.

246
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,321
Do you trust me, Tamara?

247
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,203
Yes. With my life. Everything I have.

248
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,626
Then ask no more questions
and do as I say.

249
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,084
Go!

250
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:04,841
Let's go!

251
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,510
Let none escape!

252
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,080
Zym.

253
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,783
Who are you?

254
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:28,003
Where's Khalar?

255
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:31,468
Who is Khalar?

256
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,395
Hey!

257
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,298
Come here!

258
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,801
Come on.

259
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,396
Step aside, Northerner.

260
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,815
The woman is property of Khalar Zym.

261
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,521
She is my property now.

262
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,490
Well, you have no claim to her.

263
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,118
No. But I have a claim to you.

264
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,241
And what claim is that?

265
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,119
Death.

266
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,051
Who are you?

267
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,638
When you fight a Cimmerian, even a boy,

268
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,806
you best kill him.

269
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,984
I killed hundreds of Cimmerians.

270
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:35,733
Yes. An entire village.

271
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:42,076
But I did not burn in my father's forge.

272
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,120
Run from me and I will tear apart
the mountains to find you.

273
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,333
I will follow you to hell.

274
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,389
Woman! Come here.

275
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,551
I said, come here.

276
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:16,941
Which one of you is the pureblood?

277
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:25,112
Whoever reveals her, gets to live.

278
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,585
And you smell.

279
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:51,896
Are you the one I seek?

280
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,440
Could it be you?

281
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:13,709
None of them are pure.

282
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:33,179
You know who I've come for.

283
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:35,811
Why suffer for it?

284
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,812
None of the ancient bloodline remain.

285
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:44,991
Well, if this is true,
tell me why have you and these monks

286
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:48,365
chosen to hide here like vermin
for a thousand years?

287
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,788
We live here in peace.

288
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:55,084
We have no riches. We do not make war.

289
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,453
We value life.

290
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,372
You value life.

291
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,882
Do you forget what happened
in the forests of Ophir?

292
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:12,310
When all the nations of Hyboria
hunted a woman as if she were an animal?

293
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:19,101
When both I and my daughter were forced
to watch Maliva, my innocent wife,

294
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,902
be lashed to the wheel and set aflame?

295
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:35,116
No. What you value is death.

296
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:40,751
The monks here had no part in her death.

297
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:45,422
Where is the pureblood?

298
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,977
Not to fear, Father.

299
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:02,351
He will tell me his secrets.

300
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,778
They all tell me their secrets.

301
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:10,868
Your vain pursuit for
the secrets of Acheron

302
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:15,240
is a lust for power, not a love of life.

303
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:18,747
Your innocent wife

304
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:23,081
sought to enslave all of Hyboria
with her sorcery.

305
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:26,717
She deserved to burn.

306
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:32,514
You will never rule,

307
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:37,516
and Maliva will never rise again!

308
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:40,647
Die!

309
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,618
My lord!

310
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:59,701
Remo is searching for
the one that got away.

311
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:03,044
She is the pureblood.

312
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:07,800
Remo will capture her for me.

313
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:23,933
Come here!

314
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,572
Get off.

315
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,079
My master said I would meet you.

316
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,835
He said our paths would merge.

317
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,261
You're the one Khalar Zym seeks.

318
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,260
I know nothing about it.

319
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,103
Those were his men chasing you.

320
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,351
They attacked our monastery.

321
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:10,772
So, will you escort me to Hyrkania?

322
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:17,244
We will wait for Khalar.

323
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,617
We? There is no we.

324
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,787
I will go to Hyrkania
as my master instructed.

325
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:27,462
I said, we will wait.

326
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:30,462
I said, I will go to Hyrkania.

327
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:38,841
Why must I be tied up?

328
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,642
Keep quiet and do as you're told.

329
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,638
What are you going to do with him?

330
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:49,686
I will wait for him to awaken.

331
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:53,022
I wanna look him in the eyes
when I kill him.

332
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,072
Do you have a name?

333
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:01,618
My name is Tamara Amaliat Jorvi Karushan.

334
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,084
And yours is?

335
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:07,915
Conan.

336
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,329
Conan.

337
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:11,756
That's it?

338
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,671
How many names do I need?

339
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,553
Why would you save me only to tie me up?

340
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,902
Khalar's a hard man to find.

341
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:35,777
If I possess you, he must come to me.

342
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:39,485
Possess? I am not your property.

343
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:40,615
Go to sleep.

344
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,321
I take instruction from no man.

345
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,333
I am a monk of the Order of Shaipur.

346
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,849
My people have never been conquered
by anyone the likes of you

347
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:50,871
and I'm not about to...

348
00:54:51,747 --> 00:54:53,044
Open.

349
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,047
What?

350
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,011
Quiet.

351
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:16,948
Still no word from Remo and his scouts?

352
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:24,955
They're gone. Remo will bring her here.
He has never disappointed me.

353
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:31,336
The prize is near, Father.

354
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:36,171
Soon you will have not only the mask,
but the blood to fill it.

355
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:45,059
Marique, how your mother
yearned for the sorcery of Acheron.

356
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:51,478
Imagine the secrets she will bring
back from the realm of the dead.

357
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:59,320
And imagine how indomitable I will become
when she's once again by my side.

358
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:03,986
Father...

359
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:08,992
If the girl is lost, or the ritual fails...

360
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:12,210
It will not fail.

361
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,707
If it does...

362
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,212
It will not!

363
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,592
Your mother will return to me.

364
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:29,061
My powers are growing inside of me.

365
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:33,311
My mother's blood flows through me.

366
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:38,646
I can help you uncover
the secrets of Acheron,

367
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,359
just as she did.

368
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:43,443
I can have them all kneeling before you,

369
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,995
just as I kneel before you now.

370
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:55,330
My Marique, you are like your mother.

371
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:59,000
In so many ways.

372
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,594
But you are not her.

373
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,603
Here. Drink.

374
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:25,280
The truth this time.
Why does Khalar want you?

375
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:29,617
I am a simple monk.
I am of no value to a warlord.

376
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,118
She's lying!

377
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:39,211
It's her blood. Her blood is special.
She's last of the bloodline of Acheron.

378
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:40,962
Wait.

379
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,044
Don't kill him yet.

380
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:49,591
You are mistaken.

381
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,644
That bloodline ended a thousand years ago.

382
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,471
You lie, whore.

383
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:57,187
You can kill him now.

384
00:57:57,766 --> 00:57:59,143
No, please.

385
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,856
For her, I can get you a king's ransom.
It is true.

386
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:08,410
Khalar has been searching
for a pureblood descendant for 20 years.

387
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:10,655
Then we will wait for Khalar.

388
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,661
No. He will not come this way.

389
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,459
He will be in the
Shaipur Ravine waiting for me.

390
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:18,496
I can show you.

391
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,205
Yeah.

392
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:25,093
Come.

393
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:40,438
Come on!

394
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,542
You see? I speak the truth.

395
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:11,473
If you want, he will give your
weight in gold for this woman.

396
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:16,220
I will arrange everything.
I will deliver the message.

397
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:18,813
Yes, you will.

398
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,067
Remo returns.

399
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,281
What does it say?

400
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:24,706
"The Shaipur Outpost at midday."

401
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:27,132
"Come alone."

402
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:34,598
It's hers.

403
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,317
You're bold, Northerner.

404
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:34,609
I admire courage, even when it's foolish.

405
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:41,539
Your reward.

406
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,164
- I do not want your gold.
- No?

407
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:46,666
Then what?

408
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,623
I want your head.

409
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,125
Yes, of course you do.

410
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:56,679
Kill him.

411
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:59,262
Then bring me the pureblood.

412
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:15,815
Conan!

413
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:11,248
Come on!

414
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,478
Who are you?

415
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,606
You left me behind to watch my father die.

416
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:43,694
Cimmerian.

417
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:51,373
That was your chance, boy.
You won't get another.

418
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,254
Wouldn't your father be ashamed of you?

419
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,283
Yeah.

420
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,159
Come on!

421
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:32,682
Huh? Boy?

422
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:46,487
Run!

423
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,149
No!

424
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:01,624
By Mitra, jump!

425
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,212
I had him.

426
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:53,968
Artus, I had him.

427
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:55,928
The gods are cruel.

428
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:59,762
Blast the gods. This was not their doing.

429
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:04,565
It was I who failed.

430
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:08,353
Are the tales they tell true?

431
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:12,657
Does he have eyes red as fire
and a hide of golden scales?

432
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:14,234
He is just a man.

433
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:17,495
Then it is he who has failed.

434
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:23,919
In fact, you may be the only man in Hyboria
to fight Khalar Zym and live.

435
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,711
I need to go ashore and find him.

436
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:32,047
After I go,
you must take her some place safe.

437
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,797
She saved my life.

438
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,217
For that, she has my loyalty.

439
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,304
Then she has mine as well.

440
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,708
Charming man, your friend.

441
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:06,627
Most men are born to mother's milk.

442
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:09,752
His first taste was of his mother's blood.

443
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:11,629
He was battle born.

444
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:14,544
So all he can do is kill?

445
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:17,972
Oh, no. He has the heart of a king,

446
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:20,721
the loyalty of a bloodhound.

447
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:23,765
The Barbarians may be warriors,

448
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:27,850
but they do not sacrifice their children
or enslave their allies

449
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:30,731
like the priests and princes
of the civilized world.

450
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:33,571
As for his manners...

451
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:34,863
You look like a harlot.

452
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:39,160
Yes. And apparently I'm the only woman
you've ever met who isn't one.

453
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:46,159
Cimmerian women dress as warriors.

454
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:50,497
Give her the leather and the armor.

455
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:53,295
I think he likes you.

456
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:31,045
Wake up! Wake up!

457
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:46,306
All hands on deck!

458
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:03,361
No!

459
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:49,616
How many Cimmerians died
at the edge of that blade?

460
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:54,996
Catch!

461
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:11,436
Not bad.

462
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:22,754
Farewell, good friend.

463
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,712
May you find what you seek, Conan.

464
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:53,744
It would seem our friend has
forgotten his map of the shoreline.

465
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:55,495
You should take it to him.

466
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,918
And say goodbye.

467
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:05,255
We set sail at dawn.

468
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:07,428
Don't be late.

469
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:14,761
You should go back to the ship.

470
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:17,393
Do you ever wonder if our actions
serve some plan?

471
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:22,314
Some purpose spun by the gods?

472
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:27,440
Or are we all just doomed
to chaos and ruin?

473
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:30,993
I know not and I care not.

474
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:37,538
I live, I love, I slay, and I am content.

475
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:53,193
Goodbye.

476
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:40,034
Conan!

477
01:18:24,325 --> 01:18:26,828
The elusive one. Welcome.

478
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:31,963
You have made a mistake.
I am not the person you are looking for.

479
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:45,304
It is she.

480
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:49,771
The pureblood descendent
of the Necromancers of Acheron.

481
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:41,781
I'm looking for a thief.

482
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,704
Argalon is a city of thieves.

483
01:19:45,364 --> 01:19:47,662
I'm looking for a thief named Ela-Shan.

484
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:51,288
Who are you to ask, Barbarian?

485
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:55,841
Stand down, you fools!

486
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:06,219
Fast as Yezud, he will gut you like a fish.

487
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:12,399
I owe this man my life.

488
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:16,024
Well, Ela-Shan,
you will have your chance to repay it.

489
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:19,531
Come.

490
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:39,210
This is madness.

491
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:40,840
Breaking into Khalar Zym's fortress

492
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:43,513
is like reaching under a sleeping dragon
to steal her eggs.

493
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:45,216
Why go in?

494
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:48,143
There's a woman inside.

495
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:54,441
She must be really pretty.

496
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:15,789
My mother wore this gown
on her wedding day. It flatters you.

497
01:21:18,165 --> 01:21:19,792
I'm not your mother.

498
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:23,303
No? But you will be.

499
01:21:24,463 --> 01:21:27,717
Imagine that your body is a vessel.

500
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:30,053
And your soul is the water that fills it.

501
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:35,024
When your blood seeds the mask,
my father will empty you.

502
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:37,522
Then I welcome death.

503
01:21:37,601 --> 01:21:41,606
Your death shall herald
a new age of Acheron.

504
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:46,865
The spirits I raise
will melt flesh from the bones of kings.

505
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:48,946
And my wife will make me a god,

506
01:21:49,029 --> 01:21:52,909
and we will cast all rivals
into oceans of blood.

507
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:04,004
Please. I beg you one last time.
Do not do this. Let us turn back.

508
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:10,308
Come on.

509
01:22:24,148 --> 01:22:28,198
Did you know
I met your Barbarian when he was a boy?

510
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:31,121
That I took this sword from him?

511
01:22:32,322 --> 01:22:36,293
I'm told Cimmerian steel
is sharper and harder than any other,

512
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:41,340
that when it cuts,
the pain is close to pleasure.

513
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:46,053
I know that will please you.

514
01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:57,306
That was the last gate.

515
01:22:57,389 --> 01:23:00,313
I told you, you see?
I told you I can get you in.

516
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:49,987
You!

517
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:55,076
A feast for my sword.

518
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:57,783
No! A feast for the Dweller!

519
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:10,508
Hey!

520
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:20,013
- Watch out!
- No! No!

521
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:44,750
Conan!

522
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:45,877
Conan, watch out!

523
01:24:57,884 --> 01:25:00,137
No! Hey!

524
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:04,771
Conan!

525
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:26,455
Oh, Shit!

526
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:32,966
- Get me out of here!
- Use a key!

527
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:35,139
- I can't! I dropped them!
- Then pick the lock!

528
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:36,385
With what?

529
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:46,559
Hey! Help me!

530
01:25:48,769 --> 01:25:50,362
Careful! Be careful!

531
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:54,070
Drop!

532
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,048
Hey! Hey!

533
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:20,764
Hurry up! Hurry up!

534
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,599
Hey! Help me. Hey!

535
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:03,593
Get me out of here!

536
01:27:03,677 --> 01:27:05,270
I'm dying! I'm gonna die!

537
01:27:11,476 --> 01:27:13,103
You scream like a woman.

538
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:19,527
I think it's this way.
Hey, hey, wait for me.

539
01:27:37,169 --> 01:27:40,264
Yeah, I think he's headed to Skull Cave.

540
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:42,682
I see no more locks down there.

541
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,473
Your debt is paid.

542
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:49,681
Farewell, my friend.

543
01:27:52,142 --> 01:27:55,021
If you ever need me again,
you know where to find me!

544
01:29:00,126 --> 01:29:04,381
As a victorious Barbarian sword
once shattered the mask,

545
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:08,139
so shall a vanquished
Barbarian sword revive it.

546
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:13,245
Pureblood.

547
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:31,392
Behold

548
01:30:32,969 --> 01:30:34,346
and despair

549
01:30:36,056 --> 01:30:37,683
your new master.

550
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:50,195
Maliva!

551
01:30:51,154 --> 01:30:52,622
My queen!

552
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:55,951
Hear my call!

553
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:23,250
Barbarian.

554
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:25,331
I don't like you any more.

555
01:32:57,655 --> 01:32:58,998
Jump to the ledge!

556
01:33:02,702 --> 01:33:05,046
Get up! Hide!

557
01:33:17,467 --> 01:33:18,810
That was your chance, Khalar.

558
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:20,057
And you won't get another.

559
01:33:58,591 --> 01:34:00,309
I smell you.

560
01:34:23,366 --> 01:34:24,583
Conan!

561
01:34:42,969 --> 01:34:44,971
Barbarian!

562
01:34:45,054 --> 01:34:48,934
You're too late. She belongs to me!

563
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:46,582
Die!

564
01:35:57,710 --> 01:36:00,714
Get out! Tamara, run! Run!

565
01:36:26,197 --> 01:36:31,203
I'm going to kill you
with your own father's blade.

566
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:43,719
You are not worthy of my father's sword.

567
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:55,060
Come.

568
01:36:57,437 --> 01:36:59,189
Come on.

569
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:19,967
Get up.

570
01:37:57,789 --> 01:37:59,382
Go!

571
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:02,467
Run!

572
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:32,999
Barbarian! I'm coming for you!

573
01:38:36,953 --> 01:38:38,079
Tamara!

574
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:04,237
Maliva!

575
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:09,531
I summon you here.

576
01:39:16,993 --> 01:39:18,415
His witch possesses me.

577
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:20,292
I can't fight her.

578
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:21,588
No!

579
01:39:22,748 --> 01:39:24,216
Drop me, Conan, please!

580
01:39:25,001 --> 01:39:30,508
Once again, the little Cimmerian boy
is caught holding a chain.

581
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:31,933
Let me go!

582
01:39:34,886 --> 01:39:36,012
Let me go!

583
01:39:41,058 --> 01:39:42,150
Boy.

584
01:39:42,226 --> 01:39:44,979
There is no shame in kneeling before me.

585
01:39:46,355 --> 01:39:47,652
Conan, please!

586
01:39:47,732 --> 01:39:49,450
She will live forever.

587
01:39:49,525 --> 01:39:51,118
Drop the chain.

588
01:39:51,944 --> 01:39:53,537
Let go of the chain, Conan.

589
01:39:53,613 --> 01:39:56,583
And let another die in your place?

590
01:39:58,242 --> 01:39:59,835
Like your father?

591
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:02,462
Drop me!

592
01:40:02,538 --> 01:40:06,793
I warned him that one day

593
01:40:07,502 --> 01:40:09,971
I would become a god.

594
01:40:16,344 --> 01:40:20,599
And my father warned you, god or not...

595
01:40:23,142 --> 01:40:24,143
Let me go!

596
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:25,319
You will fall!

597
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:31,859
Maliva!

598
01:40:59,011 --> 01:41:00,888
Give me your hand.

599
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:12,760
Thank you for bringing me home.

600
01:42:13,294 --> 01:42:14,546
I know you have to leave.

601
01:42:14,629 --> 01:42:15,721
Live well, Tamara.

602
01:42:17,548 --> 01:42:19,346
Till we meet again.

603
01:43:38,838 --> 01:43:41,637
This sword we make will be yours one day.

604
01:43:42,633 --> 01:43:47,480
But before you wield it,
you must understand it.
