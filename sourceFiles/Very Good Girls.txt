1
00:01:08,837 --> 00:01:11,871
- I can't do it.
- No, you can. The question is will you?

2
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:16,008
This is no great illusion

3
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,313
When I'm with you
I'm looking for a ghost

4
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:24,417
Or invisible reasons

5
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:28,921
To fall out of love and run
screaming from our home

6
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,224
'Cause we live in a house of mirrors

7
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:34,494
We see our fears and
everything's our songs

8
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:37,329
Faces and second-hand clothes

9
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,499
But more and more we're suffering

10
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,834
Not nobody, not a thousand beers

11
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:45,505
Will keep us from
feeling so all alone

12
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:50,042
But you are what you love

13
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:54,113
And not what loves you back

14
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,816
That's why I'm here on your doorstep

15
00:01:56,817 --> 00:02:00,531
Pleading for you to take me back

16
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,867
Is that a good one?

17
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,207
What the hell was that?

18
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,476
Flock of these.

19
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,548
Very funny.

20
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:32,952
You are what you love

21
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:37,423
Look at that guy. Slut Speedo.

22
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,090
Cold water makes them shrivel up.

23
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:40,691
How would you know?

24
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,329
We're really going to do this?

25
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:49,040
You can wuss up but I'll
be 20 bucks richer.

26
00:02:53,335 --> 00:02:56,942
You're just gonna take it off right
here, with everyone looking?

27
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,613
That was the idea.

28
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:02,348
Yeah.

29
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,950
I can't do it.

30
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:06,604
Yeah, you can.
The question is will you?

31
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:20,632
Oh, no.

32
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,602
You think because your eyes are
closed no one can see you?

33
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,144
Screw you.

34
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,894
Get in.

35
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,563
I can't swim!

36
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,332
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

37
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:58,004
I don't like waves. I hate waves.

38
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,605
And you just remembered this?

39
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,643
Oh, no.

40
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,210
You're naked!

41
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:08,084
I know!

42
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,286
We just came over to tell you

43
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:17,022
you have the best ass on this beach.

44
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,026
What means this?

45
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,625
You French?

46
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:24,663
We are Romania. No English.

47
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,197
Nice.

48
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:27,599
- Wanna go for a walk?
- Mm-mm.

49
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,334
Mm-mm.

50
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,937
She can use her tongue,
though, right?

51
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:37,176
- Mm-mm.
- Where you going? Come on.

52
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:39,947
I'm doing it.
Look, mom.

53
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:43,449
You didn't want to stay and see what
your special prize was going to be?

54
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,483
You mean my really
special gang rape?

55
00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:47,152
Oh...

56
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:50,122
Hey, what's the matter with you?

57
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,558
How about "I'm sorry,"
"excuse me" or something?

58
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,060
You can use your tongue.
Can't you?

59
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,098
Sorry.

60
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,399
You're selling ice cream.

61
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,601
Yeah, amazing powers of observation.

62
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,637
Can I have one?

63
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,471
Which one?

64
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,574
What's good?

65
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:11,978
Uh, they're all shit.

66
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,948
Recycled industrial waste.

67
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:20,695
The red, white, and blue, please.

68
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,428
That camera yours?

69
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:32,231
No.

70
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,666
You don't have to be such a dick.

71
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,137
She's just trying to be nice.

72
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,171
Let's go.

73
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:42,048
Thank you.

74
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,027
Your mouth is so blue.

75
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,697
I think someone hurt him.

76
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,562
That makes it okay for
him to be an asshole?

77
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:12,205
Oh, come on.

78
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,673
You liked him, too.

79
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:18,077
Hey.

80
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,144
Lilly.

81
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,416
Jesus Christ.

82
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,584
Hey, what time is it?

83
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:30,488
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe, like, 6:00?

84
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:32,224
Shit.

85
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,125
I hope Norma's still
with a patient.

86
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:37,563
Good luck. I'm going to take
my award-winning ass home.

87
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,365
Okay.

88
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,139
Please don't do that.

89
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,528
Return my bike.

90
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:47,807
Lillian, where have you been?

91
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,575
I told you this morning,
brighten beach.

92
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,277
You took it all the way to Rockaway?

93
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,844
All the way to Rockaway.

94
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,313
Okay, if you knew you
were going to be this late,

95
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:58,384
- you could've had the courtesy to call.
- My phone died.

96
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,486
Joy would like to spend some
time with her family, too.

97
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:04,089
- Well, dad's still in the office.
- That is beside the point.

98
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,491
You need to eat something
besides noodles.

99
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,594
I don't like fish.
It's disgusting.

100
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,529
- It's your dinner.
- My disgusting dinner.

101
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,731
You know what?
That's enough.

102
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,265
- Joy?
- Yeah.

103
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:17,303
Why don't you go home to your family,
and the girls will clean up.

104
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,837
Lillian, please go tell your father

105
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,505
that we are going to be
late for the concert.

106
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,373
He can't still be with a patient.

107
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:24,110
You stay there and eat some protein.

108
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,577
And take your shoes off.

109
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:29,058
You're tracking sand
all over the house.

110
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,386
Did you tell him?

111
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,279
He was with someone.

112
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,475
What is wrong with you?

113
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:26,772
Edward, please go get changed.
We're going to be late.

114
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,339
It starts at 8:00.

115
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,563
Okay, I'm going.

116
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:52,132
Uh...

117
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:55,208
Sorry, I'm...

118
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:03,608
Edward, come on.
We're going to be late.

119
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,518
Coming.

120
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,724
Al Franken.

121
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,892
Al Franken is a God damn comic.

122
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,729
He's good, but what's the
name of that show he was on?

123
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,531
And she's the best civil
rights attorney in New York.

124
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:29,468
What is she going to do, go to
Wisconsin and work for some guy

125
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,969
who's on comedy central?

126
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,305
NBC. SNL is on NBC.

127
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,507
Jon Stewart's on comedy central.

128
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,310
Thank you so much for that critically
important piece of information.

129
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,747
Hey, get your ta-tas all
sun burnt at the beach?

130
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,715
Ta-tas. Really?
That's cute.

131
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,416
You told him?

132
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:48,020
No. You know you're
an asshole, right?

133
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:50,555
How about we change the subject?

134
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,757
Sure, we could talk
about politics again.

135
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,660
Well, we could talk about
your two favorite subjects...

136
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,362
television and body parts.

137
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:57,896
- Asshole.
- That's a body part.

138
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,531
He's 16.
What's your excuse?

139
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,267
Karl, come on.

140
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,435
So how's that
tour-guide thing going?

141
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:08,007
My boss is a perv, and I
have to wear a uniform.

142
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,008
Well you have a straight shot

143
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,610
into the masonic lodges
of the United States.

144
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:15,748
That's true political power.

145
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,983
So when do you head out for school?

146
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,584
Oh, that's right. Yale.

147
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:20,719
Whiffenpoofs.

148
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,921
An Ivy-covered thing...

149
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,656
Lay off her, dad.

150
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,026
Orientation is the first
week in September.

151
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,560
They're not telling you you have
to change your orientation.

152
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:30,896
I said stop it.

153
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:33,766
She doesn't come from a family where
you have to train for dinner.

154
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,434
What's the point of dinner then?

155
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,069
Okay, great, you guys
enjoy your meal.

156
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,042
Let's go.

157
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:47,313
You just walked in on your father
boning some random patient,

158
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,020
and you don't know
what you're upset for?

159
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:52,520
Does your mom know?

160
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,925
- Are you going to tell her?
- Are you crazy?

161
00:10:58,127 --> 00:10:59,391
Everybody okay out here?

162
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:03,036
Dad, go away.

163
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,405
Your parents screw around.

164
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,575
I think they just
talk about it a lot.

165
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,457
I can't believe that you
were talking about sex.

166
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:33,124
Well, apparently in my house you
don't really talk about it.

167
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,700
You just do it.

168
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,666
We're the last ones.

169
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,402
On earth?

170
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:46,104
At Erasmus, at St. Anne's.

171
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:49,076
That's basically the same thing.

172
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:54,681
We're going to fucking college,
and we're still virgins.

173
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:58,050
We've got to get over this hump.

174
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,618
You didn't say that.

175
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:05,555
Persons of the male
gender are required.

176
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,089
Out the windows to
your right and left

177
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,690
are the air ducts to
the Holland tunnel,

178
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:42,927
and if you smell roasting coffee,
that's because general foods

179
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:46,698
built their coffee processing
plant in Hoboken in 1846.

180
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,200
There are some people who say
you can still smell the coffee

181
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,602
from the other side of the river

182
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,004
even though the plant
closed in 1992.

183
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,641
You're probably ready for an
iced coffee right about now.

184
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,176
This is the end of our tour.
Gratuities are appreciated.

185
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,744
Please be careful
getting of the boat,

186
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,714
and enjoy the rest of your
visit to the big apple.

187
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,522
- Hey, girl.
- Hi.

188
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,930
Norma? Don't you ever
have to call home?

189
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:27,199
Only when I need bail money.

190
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,939
Shit, I forgot to tell you
what happened last night.

191
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,675
So I... God, I went out to
dinner with Danny and Kate.

192
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:41,713
This, like, obscure Italian
place in the village,

193
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:47,287
and the waiter turned out to be him.

194
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,789
Who's that?

195
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,227
Um, the ice-cream guy on the beach.

196
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:58,897
His name's David, David Avery.

197
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,032
You just ran into him?

198
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:04,838
Not exactly.

199
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,171
What do you mean?

200
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:10,041
He had a book of matches

201
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,810
from Grotta Azzurra next to his
camera at the beach that day.

202
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,646
I can't believe you dragged
your parents to a restaurant

203
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,281
because you saw a book of matches.

204
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,050
Okay, you don't have to
make me feel bad about it.

205
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:21,820
I'm not. I'm just...
it's like...

206
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:24,895
Didn't you have something
you wanted to tell me?

207
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,759
Uh, Fitzsimmons.

208
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,996
He came on to you again?

209
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:34,800
No, he... he just wants
me to give a tour

210
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,801
to a boat load of FBI agents.

211
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,972
Danny's going to love that.

212
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:42,837
I'm starving.
Do you want to split a burger?

213
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,920
Who said you could come in?

214
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,754
Mom's crying.

215
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,657
She's actually crying?

216
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,026
Where's dad?

217
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:02,828
I don't know.

218
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,599
- Where is she?
- In her room.

219
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:08,367
What happened?
Did they have a fight?

220
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:11,103
No, they were just standing there.

221
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:13,842
And mom went to her bedroom.

222
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,679
What are you going to do?

223
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,070
Nothing.
It's none of our business.

224
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:25,717
I'm scared.

225
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,352
What are you scared of?

226
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,656
I don't know.
I'm just scared.

227
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,224
Come on.
I'll paint your nails.

228
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,691
- Red?
- Yeah.

229
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,957
- Really?
- Sure.

230
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,958
I feel like walking

231
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:11,295
Do you feel like coming?

232
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,999
I feel like talking

233
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,584
'Cause it's been a long time

234
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:35,320
Now your hair is long

235
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:38,456
And you look so thin

236
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,259
You're always so pale

237
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,462
But something has changed

238
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:46,065
You're almost a man

239
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,471
Hungry?

240
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,109
- You made that?
- Maybe.

241
00:17:56,509 --> 00:18:00,145
No one buys ice creams on Tuesdays.

242
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,147
What are you doing?

243
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:05,751
- No one takes boat tours on Tuesdays.
- What?

244
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,218
Are you the one who says
how many rivets there are

245
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:10,491
- in the George Washington bridge?
- Yeah.

246
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:15,828
- What's your name?
- Lilly.

247
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,100
I'm David.

248
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,142
I'm going to grab a shirt.

249
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:31,577
You ever been to the cyclone?

250
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,648
Yeah.

251
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,152
You wanna go?

252
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:40,918
Got my bike.

253
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,414
Come back for it.

254
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,028
I don't think I should.

255
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:53,440
Sure. Suit yourself.

256
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,452
682 rugby.

257
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:19,558
It still hurts

258
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,226
It hurts

259
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:28,032
It still hurts

260
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,534
It hurts

261
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:33,207
It still hurts

262
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,209
La la la la

263
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:42,748
La la la la

264
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,916
That's all I got.

265
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,350
It's not very good.
It's kind of shitty...

266
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,190
Will you stop it?
I think it's great.

267
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,862
Why do you do that?
You're good.

268
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:58,463
I called him at the restaurant.

269
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:01,867
He wasn't there. He's never anywhere
when you want to reach him.

270
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,335
I know you think I'm an idiot.

271
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,200
You barely know the guy.

272
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,176
I know.

273
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,445
So how come Norma
hasn't called you yet?

274
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,045
She's M.I.A.

275
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:17,048
Hasn't left her room in a week,

276
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,085
but I better go check the battlefield
in case there are casualties.

277
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,323
Keep the faith.

278
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,357
Call me tomorrow.

279
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:26,858
Okay.

280
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,539
People have affairs.

281
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,174
This is the 21st century.

282
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,643
It's not the fucking
end of the world.

283
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:48,379
Lillian, I would appreciate it if
you wouldn't speak to me that way.

284
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,116
Mom, there is a whole family here.

285
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,652
He said he was sorry.
I heard him.

286
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:55,587
She's probably just
some random person.

287
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,222
He only did it to get
your attention.

288
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,956
This doesn't concern you.

289
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,659
It doesn't concern me? He's
my father. I want him to stay.

290
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,964
Well, we all know how
you feel about him.

291
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:09,367
I can't believe you just said that.

292
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:13,104
- You're a God damn shrink.
- You know what, Lillian?

293
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,473
If you can't find a way
to control yourself,

294
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,641
I'm going to have to ask
you to leave the room.

295
00:21:17,642 --> 00:21:19,979
Thank God, I can't control myself.

296
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,375
You live in a porno movie.

297
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:26,011
It's a photographer's studio.

298
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,215
Frank Mayo.
You heard of him?

299
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:33,847
Lets me sleep here in exchange for
kinda acting like a security guard.

300
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:38,199
- Weird place to sleep.
- Oh, I'm up there.

301
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:47,331
Want a beer?

302
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:52,137
Think they did, like, a lipstick
commercial here today, so...

303
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:53,538
He's got a dark room, too.

304
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,139
He doesn't use it anymore,

305
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,077
so kind of teaching myself to print.

306
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:01,847
All the good stuff was shot on film.

307
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,900
Where's your family?

308
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:09,820
Now? Eastern parkway.

309
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,424
I grew up on Staten island, though.

310
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:15,341
I moved there from
Tennessee when I was five.

311
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,796
Staten island?

312
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:19,297
Yeah.

313
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:21,465
People actually live there.

314
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,382
Moved out, though,
when I was in high school.

315
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,170
How come?

316
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:29,339
It was just safer for
everyone that way.

317
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,861
You think your mom's trouble.

318
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:23,704
These all yours?

319
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,835
Yeah.

320
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,257
You really want to do this.

321
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,638
I don't want to do anything
except get out of here.

322
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:40,811
Where you want to go?

323
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,580
Rome, Paris,

324
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:45,183
I don't know.

325
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:47,886
Why?

326
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:50,355
Smell it.

327
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:52,857
Breathe it.

328
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:55,452
Tired of seeing it in photographs.

329
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,290
Sylvia Plath.
Do you know this?

330
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,909
Would you read it to me?

331
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:45,944
"Daddy,

332
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:49,547
"you do not do, you do not do

333
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,283
"any more, black shoe

334
00:25:53,284 --> 00:25:56,320
"in which I have lived like a foot

335
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,454
"for thirty years

336
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,490
"poor and white

337
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,959
barely daring to breathe or achoo"

338
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,971
I think you better get home.

339
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:50,142
You told Gerry you were
going to see her on Friday.

340
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,580
So.

341
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,955
Are you?

342
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:38,022
It was weird.

343
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:40,657
We met at the restaurant,
and then we just walked around.

344
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:43,493
And it was pretty obvious
that I was down to hook up,

345
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:44,962
and he didn't even touch me.

346
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,664
Maybe I should've come on to him?

347
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,701
I mean, aren't guys supposed to like
it when you make the first move?

348
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:53,338
I even wore my purple
sweater that's so low cut

349
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,729
my tits practically hang out of it.

350
00:27:56,774 --> 00:27:59,042
Shit.

351
00:27:59,043 --> 00:28:01,449
Maybe that was too much.

352
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,683
- Oh, my God.
- What?

353
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,351
There he is.

354
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,920
I told him I was meeting
you here for open mic.

355
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,436
- What do I do?
- Nothing.

356
00:28:11,437 --> 00:28:12,990
What do you mean nothing?
The song is about him.

357
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,287
It's fine.

358
00:28:14,288 --> 00:28:16,394
Hey, you remember my
friend Lilly Berger?

359
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:18,028
David Avery.

360
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,899
I'm so happy you're here. All right, okay.
I'm going to...

361
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,569
I'm going to go set up.
I'm really nervous.

362
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,571
So don't laugh at me.

363
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,642
I'm going to trip.

364
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:35,512
If you wanna find yourself
by traveling out west

365
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:43,513
Or if you wanna find somebody
else that's better, go ahead

366
00:28:43,921 --> 00:28:47,661
Go ahead

367
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:53,531
If you wanna buy a band
new fancy automobile

368
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:55,733
Or if you wanna build a place

369
00:28:55,734 --> 00:29:02,005
Down in east Hampton, go ahead

370
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:04,575
Go ahead

371
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,843
Go ahead

372
00:29:06,844 --> 00:29:09,513
Be my guest

373
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:10,058
Go ahead

374
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:18,955
If you wanna have your
cake and eat it, too

375
00:29:18,956 --> 00:29:21,458
Or if you wanna have other people

376
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:22,960
Watch you while you eat it

377
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:26,232
Go ahead

378
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:31,404
Go ahead

379
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,739
If you wanna hold on

380
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,508
To the first girl that you meet

381
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,551
Or if you wanna settle down

382
00:29:39,552 --> 00:29:41,178
And plant roses at my feet

383
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,651
Go ahead

384
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:48,753
Go ahead

385
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:51,088
Go ahead

386
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,191
I wish you would

387
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:58,197
Just go ahead

388
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:01,866
- You're really good.
- Thanks.

389
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:03,067
This is a great jacket.

390
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:08,373
It's my dad's.

391
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:19,787
I gotta go.

392
00:30:23,187 --> 00:30:25,022
What was that?

393
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:30,727
I mean, count on me to
find someone certifiable.

394
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:33,030
I can't imagine your
dad in that jacket.

395
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:36,266
I actually just can't
imagine him without a tie.

396
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:39,971
Have you seen him?

397
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:43,206
He uses the office, but she
won't let him come upstairs.

398
00:30:43,207 --> 00:30:44,975
Well, maybe she's right, you know?

399
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:49,280
You should be able to trust the
people that mean something to you.

400
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:51,147
What?

401
00:30:51,148 --> 00:30:53,117
Nothing.

402
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:55,086
Well, do you wanna
get something to eat?

403
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:57,722
Think I'm gonna go home.

404
00:30:57,723 --> 00:30:59,689
Well, I can't sleep.

405
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,192
The guys who went on before me

406
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,993
said that there's a
producer in the audience

407
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:04,628
and that they're meeting
up with him at Wally's,

408
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:07,063
so I think I might just
go meet up with them.

409
00:31:07,064 --> 00:31:10,067
Okay, wish me luck.

410
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,903
Luck.

411
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:13,104
Ow.

412
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:15,573
Sorry.
That was hard.

413
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:59,583
Good job, Lil.
Sit down?

414
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,917
No, thanks.

415
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:02,753
Hot as shit in that uniform.

416
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,954
I'm fine.

417
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,991
Yeah?

418
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:08,693
All right.

419
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:10,794
That trip was worth two tours.

420
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:14,197
You want more like that?
Specials?

421
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:15,221
Hmm?

422
00:32:15,222 --> 00:32:16,801
Night cruises are triple time.

423
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:19,575
I take classes.

424
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,847
You're a real pistol.

425
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:33,621
Mm.

426
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:37,221
Won't bite ya.

427
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:39,189
I'm late.

428
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:42,230
- All right. Some other time then.
- Yeah.

429
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,166
You know what you should do.
You should call the ACLU.

430
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,402
She wasn't exactly molested.

431
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:56,107
Well, verbally she was molested.

432
00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:57,308
What?

433
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,676
That's disgusting.

434
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,212
It's gluten-free.

435
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:04,214
You know, I'd rather not have a
lecture about my intestines.

436
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,817
I would just like some normal bread.

437
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,629
Such a pain in the ass.

438
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:17,128
I mean, what is wrong with white?

439
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:19,195
Come to my house.
Everything's white.

440
00:33:19,196 --> 00:33:22,332
Anyway, this is kind of a big deal,
because you do have an obligation

441
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,702
to the women who are gonna
work for this guy in the future

442
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:26,936
to make it clear that what
he said was inappropriate.

443
00:33:26,937 --> 00:33:28,438
It's not okay.

444
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,907
It was more how he said
it than what he said.

445
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,711
No, I know exactly
what you're saying.

446
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:37,814
Can we please just have,
like, a little bit of privacy?

447
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,488
Little bit.

448
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:45,864
Just think about it, Lilly.

449
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:56,099
Were you scared?

450
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,604
Yeah.

451
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:04,308
But it must feel kinda good
to have a guy want your body.

452
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:07,522
Mm, no.

453
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:21,492
He makin' a house call?

454
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,461
What are you doing here?

455
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:25,729
I just came to watch your
parents scream at each other.

456
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,602
You just turn up
whenever you want to?

457
00:34:32,002 --> 00:34:33,870
Yeah.

458
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:36,841
Yeah, I'm out of here.

459
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:39,832
I just feel like I
don't understand you.

460
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:04,419
I believe you want me to tell
you things you already know.

461
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:25,169
Where can we go?

462
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:12,269
Wait.

463
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,104
Wait.

464
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,173
I've got something.
It's all right.

465
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,478
I'm scared.

466
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:26,185
You haven't done it before?

467
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:30,588
Do you want it to be me?

468
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:33,225
Yeah, but I'm really scared.

469
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:36,872
Okay.

470
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,513
He's got you where he wants you

471
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:06,316
And he'll have you when he wants to

472
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:10,486
But you'll want him too

473
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:16,326
Yeah you'll want him too

474
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:34,111
He's got you where he wants you

475
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:38,082
And he'll have you when he wants to

476
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:42,328
But you'll want him too

477
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:58,669
You're going to be
very late for work.

478
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,738
She didn't come home
until 2:00 last night.

479
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:03,207
How do you know?
You were sleeping.

480
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,575
She woke me.
She took a shower.

481
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,310
I was hot.

482
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:10,680
Would you like to tell me
where you were so late?

483
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,349
Gerry's.

484
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,350
I don't know how late
they let her stay out,

485
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:16,653
but in this house,
your curfew is midnight.

486
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,287
Is that understood?

487
00:39:18,288 --> 00:39:19,756
I'm going to college.
There is no curfew.

488
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:22,191
You're not there yet.

489
00:39:22,192 --> 00:39:25,285
Can I play at Jackie's
after my swimming lesson?

490
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:23,720
You're like a stalker.
What do you want?

491
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,122
I'm gonna be late.

492
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:28,225
Listen, Lil, this
thing that happened

493
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:32,595
between your mother and
I, it's not your problem.

494
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,664
- It's not?
- No.

495
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:36,466
You just walk away and
leave me to deal with her

496
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,602
and then say it's not my problem.

497
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,137
I'm sorry.

498
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:41,537
This is all bullshit.

499
00:40:41,538 --> 00:40:46,577
I'm supposed to be leaving for
college, not dealing with you guys.

500
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,178
Just have dinner with me.

501
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,814
Are you kidding?
No.

502
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:54,151
Okay. All righty.

503
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:57,888
Now, ladies and gentlemen, can we
have a little attention please?

504
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,756
Can we have your attention?

505
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:03,593
Uh, we're about to commence
the cooking ritual,

506
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:07,430
as they used to say in the
international workers of the world,

507
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:11,267
by any means necessary.

508
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:15,238
And so I think we need a sacrifice.

509
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,277
So is there a virgin here?

510
00:41:20,677 --> 00:41:21,879
Oh, my God.

511
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,347
You know, there are some people

512
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:26,483
who are virgins who don't want
to be perceived as virgins,

513
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,486
and there are some people who...

514
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,287
Time to cook the hamburgers.

515
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:33,758
Time to cook the hamburgers.
Yes. Yes. Okay.

516
00:41:33,759 --> 00:41:36,792
You actually like him, don't you?
We should just swap families.

517
00:41:36,793 --> 00:41:39,263
Any time.

518
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:40,897
No one laughs at my house.

519
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:45,769
No one shuts up here.

520
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,372
I talked to David yesterday.

521
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:49,472
You did?

522
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:51,307
I mean, if you can call it that.

523
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:53,544
He's not much of a talker.

524
00:41:53,545 --> 00:41:55,412
He called you?

525
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:58,381
No, I called him to
invite him to this,

526
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:02,218
but he said he couldn't come.

527
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,588
You think I shouldn't have called?

528
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:07,299
I don't know.

529
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,541
What are you doing?

530
00:42:57,542 --> 00:43:01,278
This is my room.

531
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:02,979
Excuse me.

532
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:06,816
The last time I checked, I still
paid the mortgage on this house.

533
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:08,484
So I don't get any privacy?

534
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:10,988
Your sisters are already up and out.

535
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:14,992
- Let's get going.
- Thank God for small things.

536
00:43:14,993 --> 00:43:19,796
I sure hope the inside of your
head doesn't look like this room.

537
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:22,640
Can you just leave that?

538
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,609
Come on.
Get going.

539
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:44,720
- Lilly.
- I'm in the shower!

540
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:46,356
Do you have my cream rinse in there?

541
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:47,890
- No!
- Are you sure?

542
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:51,294
I can't find it.

543
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,928
Yeah, it's not in here.

544
00:43:52,929 --> 00:43:55,432
Your father called.

545
00:43:55,433 --> 00:43:58,434
He wants you to let him know if
you're going to have dinner with him.

546
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:00,370
Okay!

547
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:02,673
I'm going downstairs.
I have a patient.

548
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:05,645
We have 15 minutes.

549
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:24,593
I'm lost in the light

550
00:44:24,594 --> 00:44:27,232
I pray for the night

551
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:33,836
Take me to take you too

552
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,772
After so many words

553
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:40,042
Still nothing's heard

554
00:44:40,043 --> 00:44:45,448
Don't know what we should do

555
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,917
So someone could see me now

556
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:51,326
Let them see you

557
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:58,961
Was my greatest thrill

558
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:02,099
When we just stood still

559
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:08,405
Let me hold your hand
till I had my fill

560
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:11,475
Even countin' sheep

561
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:14,544
Don't help me sleep

562
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:19,950
I just toss and turn
right there beside you

563
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:22,551
So if someone could help me now

564
00:45:22,552 --> 00:45:27,089
- They'd help you too
- How'd you find this?

565
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,825
My cousins used to live here.

566
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:31,894
They'd help you too

567
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:35,531
See you through

568
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:38,135
All the hard things

569
00:45:38,136 --> 00:45:41,437
We've all got to do

570
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:44,474
'Cause this life is long

571
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,977
And so you wouldn't be wrong

572
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:50,881
Bein' free with me

573
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:51,494
On my own

574
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,667
And I held my own

575
00:46:43,668 --> 00:46:46,535
Still I rattled your bones

576
00:46:46,536 --> 00:46:52,876
I said some awful things
and I take them back

577
00:46:52,877 --> 00:46:56,146
If we would try again

578
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:59,649
Just remember when

579
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,584
Before we were lovers

580
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:04,221
I swear we were friends

581
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:07,156
So if someone could see me now

582
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:13,830
Let them see you

583
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,932
Let them see you

584
00:47:16,933 --> 00:47:20,269
See you through

585
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:23,073
All the hard things

586
00:47:23,074 --> 00:47:26,242
We've all got to do

587
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:29,546
'Cause this life is long

588
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:33,249
So you wouldn't be wrong

589
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,086
Bein' free with me

590
00:47:36,087 --> 00:47:36,699
On my own

591
00:47:53,004 --> 00:47:55,643
Really like that one.

592
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:00,709
That one?

593
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:04,280
That one's my mom.

594
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:08,051
Sometimes I wish she would just die.

595
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:11,158
Your mom?
Why?

596
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:16,899
She makes you very miserable.

597
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:24,672
I'm afraid of dying.

598
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:39,718
I'm afraid of not doing
anything while I'm still here.

599
00:48:42,118 --> 00:48:45,205
I don't think there's
much chance of that.

600
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,491
What time is it?

601
00:49:21,891 --> 00:49:24,761
9:30.

602
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:31,571
I told my mom I'd call
if I wasn't back my ten.

603
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:37,643
Where's your phone?

604
00:49:39,043 --> 00:49:41,879
Aw, come on, don't go.

605
00:49:43,279 --> 00:49:45,814
It's in the kitchen.

606
00:49:45,815 --> 00:49:48,618
Well, mine's dead.

607
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:56,693
- Mom?
- Oh, thank God.

608
00:49:56,694 --> 00:49:58,093
- Where are you?
- At a friend's.

609
00:49:58,094 --> 00:50:00,468
Gerry's been trying to find you.

610
00:50:03,868 --> 00:50:06,368
Subway...

611
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:09,875
Emergency. Her father died...

612
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:13,109
When are you coming home?

613
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,384
Right now.

614
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:23,689
What is it?

615
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:28,158
- Hey...
- Don't.

616
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:30,459
I have to go.

617
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,430
What...
what's goin' on?

618
00:50:33,431 --> 00:50:35,765
- Gerry's father died.
- Whoa, whoa. Let me go...

619
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:38,734
No.

620
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:47,071
I'm so sorry.

621
00:51:48,471 --> 00:51:51,508
I'm so sorry.

622
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,845
I don't feel anything.

623
00:51:56,846 --> 00:51:58,414
You know, I know that...

624
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:02,760
that my life has changed forever,
and all I want to do is go to sleep.

625
00:52:04,695 --> 00:52:09,859
Because I'm the same, but I'll
never be the same, you know?

626
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:13,832
Like he'll never slap
me on the butt again.

627
00:52:15,092 --> 00:52:18,468
He'll never see me
graduate, and he won't...

628
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:19,868
see me get married,

629
00:52:19,869 --> 00:52:23,105
and he'll never know my kids.

630
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:33,832
I want my daddy.

631
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:51,200
How is she?

632
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:54,269
Okay.

633
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:55,905
How are you?

634
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:58,810
I'm fine.

635
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:03,446
You can't let this happen, mom.

636
00:53:03,447 --> 00:53:06,232
You've got to let him come back.

637
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:24,367
I was very sorry to hear
about Gerry's father.

638
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:26,203
Yeah.

639
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:29,338
I'll go to the funeral
with you, if you like.

640
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,571
There isn't gonna be a funeral.

641
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:34,109
Just a memorial service.

642
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,579
Then they'll scatter his ashes.

643
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,147
That's how they do it.

644
00:53:39,148 --> 00:53:40,950
Did mom talk to you
about coming back?

645
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:43,553
Yeah.

646
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:45,354
Are you?

647
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,890
I don't know.

648
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:52,196
You could just die, and
none of this would matter.

649
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:54,296
Just talk to her.
Explain it.

650
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,932
- Say you're sorry.
- I have.

651
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:58,401
She won't let you.

652
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:01,370
Try and understand it from her side.

653
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:03,472
- Is that what you're doing?
- Yeah.

654
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:06,341
That's exactly what I'm doing.

655
00:54:06,342 --> 00:54:09,312
Now...

656
00:54:09,313 --> 00:54:11,414
I love you, but I gotta go.

657
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:13,922
Okay?

658
00:54:30,701 --> 00:54:35,071
God, I can't go back in there and
look at all that food again.

659
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:39,279
It's like we're having a
party, and he's just late.

660
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:43,379
God, I gotta get out of here.

661
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:47,350
I want to go to work,
but Kate won't let me.

662
00:54:47,351 --> 00:54:49,218
You should take a few days.

663
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:51,321
It's really weird.

664
00:54:51,322 --> 00:54:54,589
All I can think about is David.

665
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:59,272
I keep imagining that he's
gonna walk through the door.

666
00:55:11,342 --> 00:55:13,709
Hello?

667
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:17,479
Oh, David?
Yes, hold on a second.

668
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,082
It's for you.

669
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:22,156
David Applebee or something.

670
00:55:25,556 --> 00:55:27,522
Tell him I'm not here.

671
00:55:27,523 --> 00:55:29,191
Why?
You are here.

672
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:32,930
Just tell him.

673
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,134
You're weird.

674
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:39,001
She's actually not here.

675
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:42,738
Can I take a message?

676
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:45,690
Okay.

677
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:03,292
Did you get my message?

678
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:06,062
- No.
- I talked to your sister.

679
00:56:06,063 --> 00:56:08,463
- She didn't tell me.
- She said she'd write it down.

680
00:56:08,464 --> 00:56:10,600
I've been trying to get ahold of
you for, like, three days now.

681
00:56:10,601 --> 00:56:13,068
- I was with Gerry.
- How is she?

682
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:14,771
Okay.

683
00:56:14,772 --> 00:56:16,772
I have a trip in 15 minutes.

684
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:18,274
All right.
I'll come back after work.

685
00:56:18,275 --> 00:56:20,176
No, I'm gonna see Gerry after work.

686
00:56:20,177 --> 00:56:21,510
Okay.
I'll come with you.

687
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:23,312
No.

688
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:25,481
You should go this afternoon
if you're not working.

689
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:29,218
There's a lot of people at night.

690
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,789
So, is that what you want?
For me to see her alone?

691
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:35,323
Yeah.

692
00:56:35,324 --> 00:56:39,060
All right. I'll let you
know how that goes.

693
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:12,461
Hey.

694
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:14,326
Sorry about your father.

695
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:22,305
Well, thank...
thanks for... for coming.

696
00:57:22,306 --> 00:57:25,173
Do you want anything to eat or...

697
00:57:25,174 --> 00:57:27,886
No, I'm f... fine.

698
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,753
Wanna get out of here?

699
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:40,395
Yeah. Yeah.

700
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,966
Everything tastes...
sort of smells in here.

701
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:53,535
It's for the blind.

702
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:56,171
He used to take me
when I was a kid.

703
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:58,477
I mean, my...
my dad.

704
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:04,780
He was always so quiet.

705
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:07,649
It's like now.

706
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:11,855
Even he was quiet here.

707
00:58:16,927 --> 00:58:19,928
Once I came by myself on my bike.

708
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:23,298
And it started to rain.
I was like, uh...

709
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:25,700
Seven-years-old,

710
00:58:25,701 --> 00:58:28,905
terrified, soaking wet.

711
00:58:28,906 --> 00:58:32,475
And I, um...

712
00:58:32,476 --> 00:58:36,013
I looked up and he was there.

713
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,414
I didn't tell anyone where
I was going, you know?

714
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:43,187
He just...

715
00:58:43,587 --> 00:58:47,589
He knew.

716
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:49,926
I'm sorry.
Could you please hold me?

717
00:58:49,927 --> 00:58:52,806
Could you hold me?

718
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:07,149
That was dad.

719
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:16,818
Would you make love to me?

720
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,787
And I'm asking you...

721
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:20,756
You don't need to feel
responsible or anything.

722
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:23,158
You know, I just, um...

723
00:59:25,596 --> 00:59:29,397
I just feel like you understand.

724
00:59:29,398 --> 00:59:32,239
Please.

725
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:38,218
Please.

726
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,535
All right, folks.
We all know Danny was

727
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:09,939
a man of, for the people.

728
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,707
He was also a sexy son of a bitch.

729
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:14,210
I can't listen to this.

730
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:17,680
And he loved his Kate.

731
01:00:17,681 --> 01:00:21,684
Anybody who spent five minutes
with him could see that.

732
01:00:21,685 --> 01:00:25,021
He came over yesterday.

733
01:00:25,022 --> 01:00:27,627
David?

734
01:00:30,027 --> 01:00:33,196
I did it, Lilly.

735
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,001
Okay, so you're thinking
about my father...

736
01:00:40,002 --> 01:00:42,705
that this is crazy.

737
01:00:42,706 --> 01:00:44,673
But it...

738
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:46,776
It just felt right.

739
01:00:46,777 --> 01:00:48,977
You know, I needed to do it.

740
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:55,318
I understand.

741
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:58,053
You know, underneath all that tough
guy stuff, he's really... he's...

742
01:00:58,054 --> 01:01:01,756
he's so gentle and...

743
01:01:01,757 --> 01:01:04,327
I'm glad it was him.
So...

744
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:05,827
I don't feel any
different, you know?

745
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,997
I mean, I... I'm not sore.
I didn't bleed.

746
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,800
My mom always said I, uh...

747
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:14,805
I lost it to a swing
when I was four. So...

748
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:19,841
Don't worry. I'm okay.

749
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:22,678
If

750
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:26,414
You want

751
01:01:26,415 --> 01:01:26,915
to fly

752
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:38,562
I love you.

753
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:42,738
Love you.

754
01:01:48,138 --> 01:01:48,886
Just let go

755
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:59,587
of your mind

756
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:07,423
Can I have the brown?

757
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:09,492
Jackie's sleeping over.

758
01:02:09,493 --> 01:02:11,760
Who said you could use that?

759
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:13,396
It's just an eraser.

760
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:15,197
It was on your dresser.
What's the big deal?

761
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:18,436
Stay out of my room and
away from my things!

762
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:31,352
Don't be sad

763
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:36,252
Be glad

764
01:02:41,757 --> 01:02:47,799
You'll find your way

765
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:54,370
You'll find your way

766
01:02:57,808 --> 01:03:01,209
And when

767
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:05,146
You reach

768
01:03:05,147 --> 01:03:05,759
Your love

769
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:13,823
David. Too busy to answer my phone.

770
01:03:13,824 --> 01:03:18,593
Or just relax

771
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:25,205
And drift away

772
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:34,814
And if you find

773
01:03:37,214 --> 01:03:39,080
Hey.

774
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:42,484
I'll take that drink.

775
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:45,125
Um...

776
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:53,198
you want, like, a... a drink?

777
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:57,867
Oh, shit. I haven't got any ice.

778
01:03:57,868 --> 01:04:00,444
- It's fine.
- Okay.

779
01:04:08,844 --> 01:04:12,352
Okay.

780
01:04:16,752 --> 01:04:19,892
Ooh, I need a haircut.

781
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:24,656
Oh.

782
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:56,826
Oh, boy.

783
01:05:20,984 --> 01:05:23,818
Okay.

784
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:26,689
I really like you.

785
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:30,158
You're smart.

786
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:31,794
I wanna give you a
chance to walk away.

787
01:05:31,795 --> 01:05:33,662
I don't want to hurt you.

788
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:36,234
I'm a big girl.

789
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:41,205
All right.
Let's have some fun.

790
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:44,272
Come on.
Come on.

791
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:19,274
Hey, you on the pill?

792
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:21,075
- You on the pill?
- No.

793
01:06:21,076 --> 01:06:22,678
- No?
- No.

794
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:26,247
Okay.

795
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:28,050
Stay right here.
I gotta get some protection.

796
01:06:28,051 --> 01:06:30,488
Okay?

797
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:51,205
Hey!

798
01:06:51,206 --> 01:06:54,709
Hey!
Where you goin'?

799
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,330
Where you goin'?

800
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,685
Come in.

801
01:07:35,085 --> 01:07:37,118
You okay?

802
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,488
Why'd you do it?

803
01:07:39,489 --> 01:07:41,823
Do what?

804
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:44,895
Gerry.

805
01:07:46,269 --> 01:07:48,796
Don't tell me what happened
didn't mean anything.

806
01:07:48,797 --> 01:07:51,166
Yeah, it meant something.

807
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,867
You asked me to go see her.

808
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:55,137
I didn't ask you to sleep with her.

809
01:07:55,138 --> 01:07:56,905
No. She did.

810
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:59,908
So you did.

811
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,209
Is that what you think happened?

812
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:04,585
I don't have to think it happened.
She told me it did.

813
01:08:08,985 --> 01:08:11,357
She said that?

814
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:16,447
I just fucked Fizsimmons.

815
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:40,449
Dad's back. He brought
his clothes and stuff.

816
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:42,818
He got you that?

817
01:08:42,819 --> 01:08:44,485
- You had one.
- We did not.

818
01:08:44,486 --> 01:08:46,288
Dad said they were too dangerous.

819
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:49,997
Apparently, guilt will
corrupt people's principles.

820
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:58,499
You're cooking?

821
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,235
Hi.

822
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:01,904
That's it? Hi?

823
01:09:01,905 --> 01:09:03,637
You're just back?
No one talks about it?

824
01:09:03,638 --> 01:09:07,074
You haven't given us a chance
to say anything yet, Lilly.

825
01:09:07,075 --> 01:09:09,311
Here's your chance.

826
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:12,146
Your father and I decided
that it would be better

827
01:09:12,147 --> 01:09:14,882
for everybody if he...
if he came back home.

828
01:09:14,883 --> 01:09:16,517
Why?

829
01:09:16,518 --> 01:09:18,153
What are we? The wallpaper?

830
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,888
We're just supposed to sit back and
watch while you move in and move out

831
01:09:20,889 --> 01:09:23,324
and move in and move out again
like it makes no difference to us?

832
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:26,494
- This is what you wanted.
- I don't understand what's different

833
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,329
I've been asking you to
come back for weeks.

834
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,868
And now, suddenly, you just do it.

835
01:09:33,268 --> 01:09:37,840
This time, I asked him.

836
01:09:45,882 --> 01:09:47,216
Are you crazy?

837
01:09:47,217 --> 01:09:49,956
Do you want him to leave again?

838
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:55,591
What am I gonna do when you leave?

839
01:09:55,592 --> 01:09:59,064
- Transfer.
- Yeah, right.

840
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:05,903
Well, these could be cute, right?

841
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:09,572
Mmm.

842
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:12,440
You didn't buy anything.

843
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:16,714
Saving all your money for
those designer drugs?

844
01:10:18,114 --> 01:10:21,346
And I can't believe you're
gonna be in fucking old haven.

845
01:10:21,347 --> 01:10:23,084
Like, what are you gonna do there?

846
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:26,788
It's so boring.

847
01:10:30,627 --> 01:10:34,462
Do you think I should call him?

848
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:36,364
No.

849
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:38,367
No, I don't think you
should call him.

850
01:10:38,368 --> 01:10:40,468
I'm so tired of hearing about him.

851
01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:42,069
You're making a fool of yourself.

852
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:43,971
Leave the guy alone.

853
01:10:43,972 --> 01:10:47,208
If he wants to see
you, he'll call you.

854
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:49,977
Okay.

855
01:10:49,978 --> 01:10:51,512
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go home.

856
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:54,970
Great.
No one's stopping you.

857
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:17,506
Lilly!
I gotta talk to you.

858
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:19,341
Lil!

859
01:11:19,342 --> 01:11:22,543
Lil, would you talk to me?
What the fuck?

860
01:11:22,544 --> 01:11:24,578
Lil!

861
01:11:24,579 --> 01:11:27,553
Lilly!

862
01:11:29,553 --> 01:11:31,319
You gotta straighten this out, Lil.

863
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,187
- Me?
- I didn't sleep with her!

864
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:35,190
- She told me!
- You fucking better ask her again.

865
01:11:35,191 --> 01:11:37,092
I don't have to.
She's not a liar, David.

866
01:11:37,093 --> 01:11:39,160
- I want you to tell Gerry.
- Tell Gerry what?

867
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:41,462
- How this all started!
- I don't know how it started.

868
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:43,597
I wasn't there.

869
01:11:43,598 --> 01:11:45,600
- I thought you cared about her.
- I do.

870
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:48,736
Then tell her why I came to the house
that day. Tell her how it happened!

871
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:51,281
We already know what happened.

872
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:15,364
I didn't call him.

873
01:12:15,365 --> 01:12:18,533
He called me.

874
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:21,403
We're hanging out on Sunday.

875
01:12:21,404 --> 01:12:22,738
What for?

876
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:25,239
What do you mean, "what for?"

877
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:29,110
He wants to take a walk in the
gardens, where we went before.

878
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:31,379
Okay.

879
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:35,321
Well, thanks for making
me act like a person.

880
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:42,796
I like yours better.

881
01:13:22,764 --> 01:13:24,231
Go away.

882
01:13:24,232 --> 01:13:27,777
It's me.

883
01:13:34,177 --> 01:13:36,917
He's leaving.

884
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:43,618
Where's he going?

885
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:45,287
Paris.

886
01:13:45,288 --> 01:13:48,489
Tomorrow at four.

887
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:52,394
That's it?
That's all he said?

888
01:13:52,395 --> 01:13:54,234
Isn't that enough?

889
01:13:59,634 --> 01:14:02,205
I think I should go say good-bye.

890
01:14:10,713 --> 01:14:13,286
David?

891
01:14:16,686 --> 01:14:18,552
Why didn't you tell me?

892
01:14:18,553 --> 01:14:22,224
You're really somethin' else.

893
01:14:22,225 --> 01:14:23,824
- Why now?
- I'm gonna go do my work.

894
01:14:23,825 --> 01:14:26,428
I can't deal with this anymore.

895
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:29,431
I really want you to stay.

896
01:14:29,432 --> 01:14:32,234
- Then tell Gerry the truth.
- I can't!

897
01:14:32,235 --> 01:14:35,369
Do you know how hurt she would be?
What kind of friend would I be then?

898
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:38,640
I don't know. What kind
of friend are you now?

899
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:41,314
I didn't sleep with Fitzsimmons.

900
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:49,120
I'm trying to tell you the truth.

901
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:53,288
You hurt me.

902
01:14:53,289 --> 01:14:55,858
So you had to hurt me back, right?

903
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:59,997
You know, you really
are fully of shit.

904
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:03,797
You keep this up, and there
won't be anyone left

905
01:15:03,798 --> 01:15:06,209
to play with, you understand?

906
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:16,023
I gotta go.

907
01:16:01,423 --> 01:16:03,225
What was that?

908
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:04,993
He just kissed you!

909
01:16:04,994 --> 01:16:06,860
I've been seeing him.

910
01:16:06,861 --> 01:16:09,663
Since when?

911
01:16:09,664 --> 01:16:11,833
All summer.

912
01:16:11,834 --> 01:16:15,003
Until your dad died.

913
01:16:15,004 --> 01:16:17,504
Wow.

914
01:16:17,505 --> 01:16:20,542
What happened when my dad died?

915
01:16:20,543 --> 01:16:24,245
I stopped seeing him.

916
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:26,987
He started seeing you.

917
01:16:31,387 --> 01:16:35,157
You told him to see me?

918
01:16:35,557 --> 01:16:38,260
Yeah, but I didn't ask
him to sleep with you.

919
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:39,860
Oh, my God.

920
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:41,562
You're such a conceited bitch!

921
01:16:41,563 --> 01:16:43,897
What the fuck is wrong with you?

922
01:16:43,898 --> 01:16:45,367
Oh, my God!

923
01:16:45,368 --> 01:16:47,702
I just wanted to make
you feel better.

924
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:49,537
You liked him so much.

925
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:51,373
So you decided to play God, right?

926
01:16:51,374 --> 01:16:53,408
To throw him at me like
some sort of booby prize?

927
01:16:53,409 --> 01:16:56,477
Because my father dropped
dead on a subway?

928
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:59,881
God, you're sick!

929
01:16:59,882 --> 01:17:01,783
I was just trying to
do something good!

930
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:05,287
Yeah, like, sure, you
actually believed that!

931
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:09,291
- I'm so sorry.
- So am I!

932
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:11,968
I'm so sorry.

933
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:27,901
What are you doin' in here?

934
01:18:27,902 --> 01:18:30,176
Nothing.

935
01:18:34,576 --> 01:18:38,086
I had sex with someone.

936
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:48,056
You tryin' to shock me?

937
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:50,395
I don't know.

938
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:58,833
You all right?

939
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:02,439
It was with someone
Gerry really liked.

940
01:19:04,839 --> 01:19:07,941
And she's upset?

941
01:19:07,942 --> 01:19:11,750
She'll never talk to me again.

942
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:16,083
Well...

943
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:19,221
People aren't perfect, kiddo.

944
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:22,891
They make mistakes.

945
01:19:22,892 --> 01:19:26,528
Sometimes, it's harder
to forgive yourself

946
01:19:26,529 --> 01:19:29,769
than to get somebody else to do it.

947
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:36,971
But...

948
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:39,380
People will surprise you.

949
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:49,486
Well, thank you for tellin' me.

950
01:19:50,886 --> 01:19:53,706
I didn't know I could.

951
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:20,911
I'm here to turn this in
and pick up my last check.

952
01:20:38,066 --> 01:20:41,569
There you go.

953
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:44,571
I didn't expect to, uh...

954
01:20:44,572 --> 01:20:46,845
Give a shit.

955
01:20:49,245 --> 01:20:51,630
Get out of here.

956
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:22,581
I guess I never really
thought this day would come.

957
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:28,353
It's your turn, babe.

958
01:21:30,753 --> 01:21:36,162
At least, I gave you some stellar
examples of how not to do it.

959
01:21:43,598 --> 01:21:46,832
Okay. Let's go.

960
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,567
I think this is for you.

961
01:23:24,967 --> 01:23:27,989
You were there, weren't
you, when he took that?

962
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:33,408
Yes.

963
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:36,310
I got it in the mail yesterday,
so I guess that was his...

964
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:39,350
his way of making sure
that you'd see it.

965
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:46,354
No.

966
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:49,798
It was his way of making sure
that we'd see each other.

967
01:24:01,437 --> 01:24:04,840
I'm so sorry, Ger.

968
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,941
What are you doin'?

969
01:24:07,942 --> 01:24:10,177
You don't know how sorry I am.

970
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:13,382
Okay, I bet.
You...

971
01:24:14,782 --> 01:24:16,050
What are you doin'?

972
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:18,485
This guy was smiling.
Happy.

973
01:24:18,486 --> 01:24:20,221
You need to put your clothes on.

974
01:24:20,222 --> 01:24:23,091
Because this is crazy.

975
01:24:23,092 --> 01:24:26,595
Yeah? You have to forgive me.

976
01:24:27,995 --> 01:24:30,933
I can't lose you.

977
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:34,504
Um, okay.
I, um...

978
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,771
I didn't do it.

979
01:24:37,772 --> 01:24:39,106
I didn't do what?

980
01:24:39,107 --> 01:24:41,309
I didn't sleep with him.

981
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:44,278
Um...

982
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:45,747
I asked...
I begged...

983
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:48,048
and uh, he kissed me on the head

984
01:24:48,049 --> 01:24:53,556
and told me that he was in
love with someone else.

985
01:24:54,956 --> 01:24:57,257
I'm really sorry.
I'm... I'm so sorry.

986
01:24:57,258 --> 01:24:59,494
I'm... I'm never gonna
lie to you again,

987
01:24:59,495 --> 01:25:01,462
I... I swear.

988
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:04,367
I was just...
I was really confused.

989
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,368
- Angry?
- Yeah.

990
01:25:07,369 --> 01:25:09,837
At Danny, you know, for just...

991
01:25:09,838 --> 01:25:12,107
fucking dying.

992
01:25:13,008 --> 01:25:14,775
Ooh. Love you.

993
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:16,177
Me too.

994
01:25:16,178 --> 01:25:19,747
I'm gonna visit you
a lot, a lot, a lot!

995
01:25:21,249 --> 01:25:23,450
- Uh-oh. Oh, my God!
- Uh-oh.

996
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:25,086
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, my God!

997
01:25:25,087 --> 01:25:27,288
What's goin' on here?

998
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:29,556
What's happening?

999
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:31,359
Lilly's naked.

1000
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:34,129
Shut up.

1001
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,909
If you want to find yourself

1002
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:24,278
By travelin' out west

1003
01:26:24,279 --> 01:26:27,315
Or if you wanna find somebody else

1004
01:26:27,316 --> 01:26:32,121
That's better go ahead

1005
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:36,594
Go ahead

1006
01:26:38,994 --> 01:26:43,297
If you wanna buy a brand
new fancy automobile

1007
01:26:43,298 --> 01:26:45,900
Or if you wanna build a place

1008
01:26:45,901 --> 01:26:48,101
Up in cold water canyon

1009
01:26:48,102 --> 01:26:50,575
Go ahead

1010
01:26:52,975 --> 01:26:55,946
Go ahead

1011
01:26:57,346 --> 01:26:59,913
Go ahead

1012
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:02,149
I wish you would

1013
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:05,022
Go ahead

1014
01:27:07,422 --> 01:27:12,059
If you wanna have your
cake and eat it too

1015
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,628
And if you wanna have other people

1016
01:27:14,629 --> 01:27:16,564
Watch you while you eat it

1017
01:27:16,565 --> 01:27:17,109
Go ahead

1018
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:24,773
Go ahead

1019
01:27:26,173 --> 01:27:28,476
Go ahead

1020
01:27:28,477 --> 01:27:31,011
Be my guest

1021
01:27:31,012 --> 01:27:35,018
Go ahead

1022
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:41,489
If you want

1023
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:46,427
Better things

1024
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:54,428
I want you to have them

1025
01:27:56,570 --> 01:27:57,070
If you

1026
01:28:01,008 --> 01:28:06,413
Want better things

1027
01:28:06,414 --> 01:28:11,118
Then I want you

1028
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:14,291
To have them

1029
01:28:15,691 --> 01:28:16,235
Go ahead

1030
01:28:20,395 --> 01:28:20,939
Go ahead

1031
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:27,202
Go ahead

1032
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:30,337
I wish you would

1033
01:28:30,338 --> 01:28:33,710
Go ahead

1034
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:37,244
Go ahead

1035
01:28:37,245 --> 01:28:40,347
I wish you would

1036
01:28:40,348 --> 01:28:40,892
Go ahead

1037
01:28:53,395 --> 01:28:55,296
La la la la

1038
01:28:55,297 --> 01:28:59,201
I fell asleep in my parents' room

1039
01:28:59,601 --> 01:29:03,270
I awoke to the cable news

1040
01:29:03,271 --> 01:29:07,377
There was a fire at Brooklyn school

1041
01:29:09,777 --> 01:29:13,681
I melted down like Fukushima

1042
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:15,416
Don't you wanna know

1043
01:29:15,417 --> 01:29:17,551
How I'm feelin'

1044
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:23,190
I just want to talk to you

1045
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:26,560
'Cause it burns

1046
01:29:26,561 --> 01:29:31,464
It still burns

1047
01:29:31,465 --> 01:29:33,667
It burns

1048
01:29:33,668 --> 01:29:38,739
It still burns

1049
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:40,775
It burns

1050
01:29:40,776 --> 01:29:43,715
It still hurts

1051
01:29:47,115 --> 01:29:49,083
La la la la

1052
01:29:49,084 --> 01:29:49,584
Ooh

1053
01:29:54,321 --> 01:29:56,589
La la la la

1054
01:29:56,590 --> 01:29:59,293
Hold up I'm comin'

1055
01:29:59,294 --> 01:30:03,797
In the glow of the rising sun

1056
01:30:03,798 --> 01:30:06,400
I found my calling

1057
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:08,569
In the lows and the feeling

1058
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:12,839
Of when you're gone

1059
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,809
It burns

1060
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:19,779
It still burns

1061
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:22,083
It burns

1062
01:30:22,084 --> 01:30:27,421
It still burns

1063
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,256
It burns

1064
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:32,996
It still hurts

1065
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:39,071
La la la la

1066
01:30:42,471 --> 01:30:44,437
La la la la
