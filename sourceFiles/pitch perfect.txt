1
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:52,385
Now, this is exactly the type of
performance you would expect to see

2
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,722
at the international Championship
of Collegiate A Cappella.

3
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:56,931
Am I right, Gail?

4
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,016
John, you're so right,
everything else seems wrong.

5
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,228
Boy, these Barden University
Treblemakers always thrill the judges.

6
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,856
And the ladies in the room
cannot get enough.

7
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,065
So true, John.

8
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,819
Nothing makes a woman feel more like a
girl than a man who sings like a boy.

9
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:40,975
Chloe, look at you. You're a mess.
You're unfocused. You're unreliable.

10
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:45,104
And your breath smells
like egg. Like, all the time.

11
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:49,442
I can't believe the Bellas are being passed
on to you two slut bags after we graduate.

12
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,444
Just don't eff up your solo.

13
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,653
I won't disappoint you.

14
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,697
My dad always says,
"if you're not here to win,"

15
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,157
"get the hell out of Kuwait."

16
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,701
Has your dad ever
told you to shut up?

17
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,915
I'm fine.

18
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,884
Ouch! Boy, that hurt.

19
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,511
Sexy man-splits.

20
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,596
His pain is our gain, Gail.

21
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:35,905
All right, good luck, guys!

22
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,326
Good luck out there!

23
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:44,789
Seriously, you girls are
awesome... ly horrible.

24
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:48,167
I hate you. Kill yourselves. Girl power!
Sisters before misters!

25
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:54,131
All right, ladies, it's
now or never. Hands in!

26
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,217
One, two...

27
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:01,931
Up now, the Barden Bellas!

28
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,267
Well, the Bellas
tonight are making history

29
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,937
as the first ever all-female group
to advance to the ICCA finals.

30
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,231
That's right, John. Now, why
do you think it's taken so long

31
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,526
for an all-lady group to break through
that a cappella glass ceiling?

32
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,779
Well, Gail, the women, typically,
cannot hit the low notes,

33
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,407
which really round out an
arrangement, thrill the judges,

34
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,367
and that can really hurt
them in competition.

35
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,245
Women are about as good at a cappella
as they are at being doctors.

36
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,752
One, two, three, four.

37
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,784
Is it me or did we just take a
left turn into Snoozeville?

38
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,787
Yeah, and we parked in a lot
where they do not validate.

39
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,715
No! Holy...

40
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,717
This is a surprise!

41
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,261
This has never happened! Now, this
is how you bring some excitement

42
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:25,598
to the international Championship
of Collegiate A Cappella.

43
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,100
She had a week's worth
of lunch and lost it.

44
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,936
Well, she didn't lose it.
We know exactly where it is.

45
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,479
It's all over the third row.
No, no...

46
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,930
I got it. Thanks.

47
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,857
Hi there! Welcome to Barden
University. What dorm?

48
00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,734
Baker Hall, I think.

49
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,361
Okay. So, what you're gonna do is
you're gonna go down this way,

50
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,447
you're gonna take a right and you
go through those double doors...

51
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,751
Your campus map.

52
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,670
And your official
BU rape whistle.

53
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,380
Don't blow it unless
it's actually happening.

54
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,292
Hey.

55
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,254
You must be Kimmy Jin.
I'm Beca.

56
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,841
No English?

57
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,344
Yes English?

58
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,348
Just tell me where
you're at with English.

59
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,523
There he is. I'm Benji.
You must be Jesse.

60
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,484
And you must be kidding. Wow!

61
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,363
Looking at it now, I can
see that it's a bit much.

62
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:28,739
I can take it down.

63
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,450
No, no way. I mean, it took a
second for my eyes to adjust,

64
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:32,576
but I can roll with this.

65
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,620
Look, just so you know,
I'm not a total nerd.

66
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:38,374
I also happen to be super
into close-up magic.

67
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,586
Dude, that's awesome!

68
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,630
How long was that
little guy in there?

69
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,756
Several days.

70
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,355
Hey, this is campus police.
Hide your wine coolers.

71
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,569
Just... it's your old
man making a funny.

72
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,654
Chris Rock, everybody.

73
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,906
Hey, you must be
Beca's roommate.

74
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,617
I'm Dr. Mitchell, Beca's dad.

75
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,078
I teach Comparative
Literature here.

76
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,002
So, when did you get here?
How did you get here?

77
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,297
Took a cab. Didn't wanna
inconvenience you and Sheila.

78
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,423
How is the stepmonster?

79
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:32,261
She is fine, thank you for asking. She's
actually in Vegas at a conference...

80
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,598
No, Dad, I don't actually care. L
just wanted to say "stepmonster."

81
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,352
So, have you guys been
out on the quad yet?

82
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,063
In the springtime, all the
students study on the grass.

83
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,481
I don't wanna study
on the grass, Dad.

84
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,984
I need to move to LA and get
a job at a record label

85
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,402
and start paying my dues.

86
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,196
Here we go again.
You know, Beca,

87
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,115
DJing is not a profession,
it's a hobby.

88
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,577
Unless you're Rick Dees
or someone awesome.

89
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,705
That's not... l...

90
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,875
I wanna produce music.
I wanna make music, Dad.

91
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,669
But you're going to get
a college education first.

92
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,631
For free, I might add.
End of story.

93
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,009
I'm going to
the Activities Fair.

94
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:16,805
Me, too. I'm going to the Activities Fair
with my super-good friend, Kimmy Jin.

95
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,820
Taking names, taking numbers.
Join our righteous frat.

96
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,990
If you ain't pledging Sigma
Beta, you ain't worth no crap.

97
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,827
That's a double negative.
That's a lot of negatives.

98
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:42,331
Follow me. There's only one group
on this campus worth joining.

99
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,210
As far as Barden goes, that's
what being a man's all about.

100
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,432
The Treblemakers.

101
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,560
The rock stars of a cappella,
the messiahs of Barden.

102
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:08,023
Well, you know, not including athletes,
frat guys, or actual cool people.

103
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,943
Organized nerd singing.
This is great.

104
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,779
Yeah, it makes so much
sense. How's your voice?

105
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,494
Nice.

106
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,874
I will stop at nothing to
take those ding-a-lings down.

107
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,670
Hey, Barb. You gonna audition
this year? We have openings.

108
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,463
Now that you've
puked your way to the bottom,

109
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,923
you might actually consider me?

110
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,634
I auditioned for you three
times and never got in

111
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,220
because you said
my boobs look like baloney.

112
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:43,309
The word's out. Bellas is the
laughing stock of a cappella.

113
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:47,604
Good luck auditioning
this year. Douche-b's.

114
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,275
My God. This is a travesty.

115
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,361
God, if we can't even recruit Baloney
Barb, then we can't get anybody.

116
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,905
Just take the dramatics down a notch, okay?
Hi, do you wanna...

117
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,657
Well, you're the one
who got us into this hot mess.

118
00:10:58,742 --> 00:10:59,700
We'll be fine.

119
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,493
I am confident
that we will find

120
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,371
eight super-hot girls
with bikini-ready bodies

121
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:07,416
who can harmonize
and have perfect pitch. Okay?

122
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,419
Hi, would you like to
be a member of...

123
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:15,341
Just keep flyering.
We have tradition to uphold.

124
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,509
How about we just
get good singers?

125
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,262
What? Good singers? What? Hi.

126
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,097
Can you sing? Yeah.

127
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,350
Can you read music? Yeah.

128
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,852
Can you match pitch? Try me.

129
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,533
Yeah.

130
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,047
That was a really good start.

131
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,801
I'm the best singer
in Tasmania. With teeth.

132
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,302
Love it. What's your name?

133
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,720
Fat Amy.

134
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,807
Um... You call
yourself Fat Amy?

135
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:08,060
Yeah, so twig bitches like you
don't do it behind my back.

136
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:15,484
I will see you in
auditions, Fat Amy.

137
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,364
I can sing but I'm also
good at modern dance,

138
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:24,118
olden dance, and
mermaid dancing,

139
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,078
which is a little different.

140
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,664
You usually start
on the ground.

141
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,249
Ooh.

142
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,334
It's a lot of floor work.
I see that.

143
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:47,224
Yeah, DJs. Deaf Jews.

144
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,186
Shalom!

145
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,106
That's not a real word
but keep trying.

146
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,983
You will get there.

147
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,777
Not a lot of Jewish people
where you're from?

148
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,906
No. I did do Fiddler on the
Roof, though, in high school.

149
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:06,702
It was, like, me and some Aboriginals.
It was really Jewish.

150
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,954
It was full-on Jew.

151
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:13,375
Hey, guys. All right,
I'll give you my number.

152
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,588
What about her?

153
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:22,092
I don't know. She looks a
little too alternative for us.

154
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,595
Hi, any interest in joining
our a cappella group?

155
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,056
Right, this is,
like, a thing now.

156
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,936
Totes. We sing covers of songs but
we do it without any instruments.

157
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,480
It's all from our mouths.

158
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:35,898
Yikes.

159
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:39,860
There's four groups on campus. The Bellas.
That's us. We're the tits.

160
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,320
The BU Harmonics.

161
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,572
They sing a lot of Madonna.

162
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,408
The High Notes.

163
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,870
They're not particularly
motivated.

164
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,455
And then there's...

165
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,254
So, are you interested?

166
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,632
Sorry, it just,
it's pretty lame.

167
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,510
A-ca-scuse me?

168
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:08,639
Synchronized lady dancing to a Mariah
Carey chart topper is not lame.

169
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,767
We sing all over the world and we
compete in national championships.

170
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:13,644
On purpose?

171
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,855
We played the Cobb Energy
Performing Arts Centre, you bitch!

172
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,527
What Aubrey means to say
is that we are a close-knit,

173
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,779
talented group of ladies
whose dream is

174
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,199
to return to the national finals
at Lincoln Center this year.

175
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,660
Help us turn our dreams
into a reality?

176
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:34,414
Sorry, I don't even sing, but it
was really nice to meet you guys.

177
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,129
What are we gonna do?

178
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,674
When you came in and you were
just strumming the guitar,

179
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,134
and it was, like, totally
off-key, I wanted to choke you!

180
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,970
Bumper.
I wanted to choke you out!

181
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,347
Okay, I'm gonna
go introduce myself.

182
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,391
Everybody be cool.
It's just a normal day.

183
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,896
Hi. Hi.

184
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,731
Benjamin Applebaum.

185
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,693
I saw you guys perform at a Mall
of America like three years ago.

186
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,445
Totally changed my life. I have not
stopped thinking about you since.

187
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:07,823
Thank you. Yeah.

188
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,826
And, Bumper, huge fan.

189
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,412
Your arrangement of Lovin'
Spoonful's Do You Believe in Magic

190
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:17,708
inspired me to become
a certified illusionist.

191
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,334
Wow.

192
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,588
The smell of your weird is
actually affecting my vocal cords,

193
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,716
so I'm gonna need you
to scoot. Skedaddle.

194
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,634
But why don't we just
exchange emails,

195
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,261
and then totally hang out
right now, together?

196
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,639
No. Hard pass. Hard pass.

197
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:38,228
What a nerd alert. Okay,
guys, now let's match pitch.

198
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,441
Too far. You think?

199
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,443
Yeah. Should I have
done another trick?

200
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,863
No, I think your trick was fine. I just
think the talking was a little weird.

201
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,698
Maybe you can try to
Facebook message him.

202
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,459
Hey, I'm Beca.

203
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,586
Over there. Thanks.

204
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,556
Ninety-five point seven, WBUJ,
music for the independent mind.

205
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,663
Hey. Hi.

206
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:38,872
Have you been
standing there long?

207
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,585
No. No, I just got here,
I wasn't just standing here.

208
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,255
Freshmen aren't allowed in the booth.
Sorry.

209
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,467
I'm Luke. Station manager.
You must be Becky the intern?

210
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,135
Lt's...

211
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,762
Hey, man, what's up? I'm Jesse.

212
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,931
I'm Luke. You're late.

213
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,559
Hey. I know you.

214
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:00,936
No, you don't. Yeah, I do.

215
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,521
He doesn't. Totally know her.

216
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:05,357
Okay, cool. Well, you guys can figure
it out while you're stacking CDs.

217
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,942
When you're done, there's more.

218
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:11,405
Now, you guys will be spending a lot
of down time together, so please, just

219
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,656
no sex on the desk.

220
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,366
I've been burned before.

221
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:20,872
I do know you. I sang to you. L
remember because you were in a taxi.

222
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,126
Wait, is your dad a taxi driver?
No.

223
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,049
This sucks. I wanted
to play music.

224
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:36,179
Not me. I'm here for one reason only.
I really love stacking CDs.

225
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:39,766
So, what's your deal?

226
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:42,936
You one of those girls
who's all dark and mysterious,

227
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,897
then she takes off her glasses and
that amazingly scary ear spike

228
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,734
and you realize that, you know,
she was beautiful the whole time.

229
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,777
I don't wear glasses.
Then you're halfway there.

230
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:38,492
Beca.

231
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:41,369
Beca, wake up.

232
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:46,124
Funny, this doesn't look like
your lntro to Philosophy class.

233
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:49,127
I'm posing an important
philosophical question.

234
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,880
If I don't actually go to that
class, will it still suck?

235
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,634
Look, honey.
College is... it's great.

236
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,386
You get to create memories
here, I see it every day.

237
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,305
You just have to
give it a chance.

238
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:04,059
You've been here, what, a month now?
Do you have any friends?

239
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,728
Kimmy Jin is my friend. No.

240
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:11,066
You gotta get out there, Bec.
You gotta try something.

241
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,609
I got a job at
the radio station.

242
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,902
Great, that place.

243
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:18,406
Yeah, it's dark and dirty and has like,
what, those three weirdos who work there?

244
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,991
Well, four now.

245
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:23,662
You gotta try something new,
Bec. Join one club on campus.

246
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,915
And if, at the end of a year,
you still don't wanna be here,

247
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:31,378
you still wanna go off to
LA and be P. Diddy,

248
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,798
well, then, you can
quit college.

249
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,259
And I will help you move to LA.

250
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,511
Seriously? Yes, seriously.

251
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,179
But I really need
to see it, Beca.

252
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:45,183
This is college. Join in.

253
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,056
You can sing! Dude!

254
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,517
How high does your belt go?
My what?

255
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,020
My God! You have to
audition for the Bellas.

256
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,814
I can't concentrate on anything you're
saying until you cover your junk.

257
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,399
Just consider it.

258
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,402
One time, we sang
backup for Prince.

259
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,155
His butt is so tiny that I can
hold it with, like, one hand.

260
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,657
Oops!

261
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,452
Seriously. I am nude.

262
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,828
You were singing
Titanium, right?

263
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:51,791
You know David Guetta? Have I
been living under a rock? Yeah.

264
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,960
That song is my jam.

265
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,587
My lady-jam.

266
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,047
That's nice.

267
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,674
It is. That song really builds.

268
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,261
Gross. Can you sing it for me?

269
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,055
Dude, no. Get out!

270
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:09,142
Not for that reason. I'm not
leaving here till you sing. So...

271
00:21:56,315 --> 00:22:01,569
Yeah. I'm pretty
confident about all this.

272
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,530
You should be.

273
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,579
Still need to shower.

274
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,499
You have a lovely voice.

275
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,418
Thanks.

276
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,259
Yeah. See you at auditions!

277
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,012
For your audition, each of you
will be singing sixteen bars

278
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,389
of Kelly Clarkson's
Since You've Been Gone.

279
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,851
If a group likes you, they
will contact you directly.

280
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:36,104
My tone-deaf sidekick Justin here
will be collecting your information.

281
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,523
If I could sing a lick,
in any human way possible,

282
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,817
I would, but I can't.

283
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,903
And I hate myself every day
because of it! I know.

284
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,907
But if you think this is
just some high school club,

285
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:51,911
where you can sing and dance your
way through any big social issue,

286
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,080
or confused sexuality,

287
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,291
you have come to
the wrong place.

288
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,335
There is none of that here.

289
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,879
That's high school.

290
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,798
This shit is real life!

291
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:08,386
Now, don't just bring it,
sing it. And let's do this.

292
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:17,979
Hey, Bellas, remember when you tried to
play in the big leagues and you choked?

293
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,231
That should really be
a lesson to everyone.

294
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:23,068
If you sing the same boring,
girly shit every year,

295
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,320
you will blow chunks.
All over the place.

296
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,072
Vomit everywhere.

297
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:28,656
My fellow a-ca-people.

298
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:33,745
We will not let egotistical,
big-headed, garbage dirtballs,

299
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,998
whoever you may be,
get in our way.

300
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,333
I promise you,

301
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,462
we will return to the lCCAs and
finish what we started last year.

302
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,841
And here's the first
one up. Good luck.

303
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,302
Whenever you're ready, dude.

304
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,681
Yeah, hi, my name
is Cynthia Rose.

305
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,851
Not a dude. It's not a dude.

306
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,671
There's no backup
dancers? Okay.

307
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:29,300
Hello. My name is Lilly Onakuramara.
I have gills like a fish.

308
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,594
I'm sorry. What was that?

309
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:37,016
Hello. My name is Lilly Onakuramara.
I was born with gills like a fish.

310
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,481
One, two, three, four.

311
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:02,417
Hi, everybody,
my name is Stacie.

312
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:06,087
My hobbies include cuticle
care and the E! Network.

313
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:25,398
It's high.

314
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:29,152
Jesus.

315
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:14,280
Thank you.

316
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:16,908
Performing live gives
me such a rush.

317
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,457
Crushed it.

318
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:29,963
Okay. That is everybody. I'm really
not that impressed this year, guys.

319
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,508
Wait, there's one more.

320
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,260
Hi.

321
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,303
Hello.

322
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:39,514
Um...

323
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,808
I didn't know we had
to prepare that song.

324
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:44,227
That's okay. Sing
anything you want.

325
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,523
May I?

326
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:47,582
Wow.

327
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:51,169
The sopranos. Jessica,
Mary Elise, Lilly.

328
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:55,214
The mezzos. Cynthia
Rose, Stacie, Kori.

329
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:59,969
And our altos. Fat Amy,
Denise, Ashley, and Beca.

330
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:07,935
We shall begin by drinking the blood
of the sisters that came before you.

331
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,230
Dude, no. Don't worry,
it's Boone's Farm.

332
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:16,361
Well, well, well,
look who's in treble.

333
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:20,239
Classic pun. I know.

334
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,036
No Benji?

335
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,997
Now, if you'll place your
scarves in your right hand.

336
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,959
L, sing your name...

337
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,294
I...

338
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:41,636
promise to fulfill the duties and
responsibilities of a Bella woman.

339
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:46,349
Promise to fulfill the duties and
responsibilities of a Bella woman.

340
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:50,895
And I solemnly promise to never have
sexual relations with a Treblemaker

341
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,023
or may my vocal cords
be ripped out by wolves.

342
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:59,529
And I solemnly promise to never have
sexual relations with a Treblemaker

343
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:03,574
or may my vocal cords
be ripped out by wolves.

344
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:06,494
You are all Bellas now.

345
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,666
We did it.

346
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,960
I want some more of this.

347
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:16,921
Did we?

348
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:24,595
Ladies, welcome
to a-ca-initiation night.

349
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,181
Prepare to soften the beach.

350
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,019
I don't know what
I'm doing here.

351
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:35,565
Just living the dream. I still can't
believe they let my sexy fat ass in.

352
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,733
Beca! Beca!

353
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,026
Wow.

354
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:41,779
Be-caw! Be-caw.

355
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:45,324
Do my eyes deceive me
or are you a Barden Bella?

356
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,577
No. You're one of those
a cappella girls,

357
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:50,997
I'm one of those a cappella boys,
and we're gonna have a-ca-children.

358
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,040
It's inevitable.
You're really drunk right now.

359
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,542
I don't think you're gonna
remember any of this.

360
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,878
No. I'm not drunk at
all, you're just blurry.

361
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,378
You okay? Yeah? Yeah.

362
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,422
You almost fell over? No, she didn't.
You know, I could...

363
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:00,965
Can you pass a sobriety
test right now? Yep.

364
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,592
Can you stand up straight?
See how I come right back?

365
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:05,136
And I come right back.
Right. Wow.

366
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,304
Can I get you a drink?

367
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,055
It sounds great.

368
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:09,390
I'm gonna get you a drink.
Go for it.

369
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,684
I think you need to
get on this level.

370
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,352
Please be careful.

371
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:14,812
Hi.

372
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:17,523
I am so glad that I met you.

373
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,943
I think that we're gonna
be really fast friends.

374
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,322
Yeah. Well, you saw me naked, so...
Yeah.

375
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:29,911
Yeah. Yeah, ladies. Gather around.
Ready for a show.

376
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,663
Come on, baby bubble, wait in line.
Yep. Yeah.

377
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,665
You want some of this.
I know you do.

378
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,543
Nice. Mmm-Bumper and Donald.

379
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,714
Getting it.

380
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,967
You know, so there's
like 10 of us. Mmm...

381
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:48,012
That means that one of us
is probably a lesbian.

382
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,598
You think? Which one
do you think it is?

383
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,892
My money's on Black Beauty.

384
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,685
So, when I drink
too much tonight,

385
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,064
can I count on you to hold
my hair back if I puke?

386
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:01,734
Don't tell her I said that.

387
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:05,446
All right. I'm gonna go get a drink.
This ginger needs her jiggle juice.

388
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,574
See you later.
Make good choices.

389
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:12,370
I thought of a new
name for this hairstyle.

390
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,830
It's called the Orthodox
Jew ponytail.

391
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:15,915
Yeah?

392
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,084
'Cause it's very reserved at the front...
l see that.

393
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,795
But party in the back.
I see these happening here.

394
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,724
Here's the real question.

395
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,059
Who would be easier
to sleep with?

396
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,852
Captain America or
a great white shark?

397
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,396
Great white shark. I wouldn't...
Hey.

398
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,730
What are you turd
burgers talking about?

399
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,108
Dressing for comfort?

400
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:46,862
You are probably the grossest
human being I've ever seen.

401
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:49,490
Well, you're no
panty-dropper yourself.

402
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:54,662
So I have a feeling
that we should kiss.

403
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:58,207
And is that feeling a good
feeling or an incorrect feeling?

404
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,835
Well, I sometimes have a
feeling I can do crystal meth,

405
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:03,963
but then I think,
"Better not." Yeah.

406
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,975
I don't know the words,
but I can...

407
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,643
Thank you.

408
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:20,605
This is awesome.

409
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,523
It's definitely something.

410
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,484
We are the kings of campus!

411
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:53,179
Man, the old Bellas was hot!

412
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:55,139
Yeah, they kept it tight.

413
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,726
Okay. Sopranos in the front
and altos in the back.

414
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:02,647
As you can see,
Kori is not here.

415
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,857
Last night she
was Treble-boned.

416
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,901
She has been disinvited
from the Bellas.

417
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,069
That oath was serious?

418
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,987
Dixie Chicks serious.

419
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,282
You can fool around with whoever
you want to, just not a Treble.

420
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,577
That's not gonna be
easy. He's a hunter.

421
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:18,496
You call it a dude?

422
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,165
Stacie, the Trebles
don't respect us,

423
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,875
and if we let them
penetrate us,

424
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:27,129
Not a good enough reason
to use the word "penetrate."

425
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:31,801
So, does anyone here
have anything to confess?

426
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,559
It was an accident. I...

427
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:41,936
Turn in your scarf and go.

428
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,702
Slut.

429
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,121
Take your chair.

430
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,468
Was that necessary?

431
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:17,304
This is war, Beca,

432
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,891
and it is my job to make sure that
my soldiers are prepped at go time

433
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:24,061
with three kick-ass songs sung
and choreographed to perfection.

434
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,355
And there are only four
months until regionals.

435
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,524
So, if you have a problem with
the way that I run the Bellas,

436
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,192
then you should just...

437
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,030
Don't stress, Aubrey. Relax.

438
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:37,158
We don't want a repeat of
what happened last year.

439
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,162
What happened last year?

440
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:42,747
What are you saying?

441
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,332
What happened last year?

442
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,212
And do you guys wanna
see a dead body?

443
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,766
Click on "Guy Pukes on Cat."

444
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,642
Enough! It happened. It's over.

445
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:08,272
We will practice every day for at
least two hours, seven days a week.

446
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,774
And I trust you will
add your own cardio.

447
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,444
Why cardio? Yeah, no, don't
put me down for cardio.

448
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,070
Okay, moving on.

449
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:18,240
This is a list of all of the songs
that we have ever performed.

450
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:21,952
And you will notice that we only
do songs made famous by women.

451
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,370
There's nothing from
this century on here.

452
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,581
Because we don't
stray from tradition.

453
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:32,838
Now, this is how we
will become champions.

454
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,566
Come on, girls! Let's go!

455
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,485
Go, go, go! Pick up your knees!

456
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,737
Faster, faster! One, two,
one, two, one, two!

457
00:35:56,822 --> 00:36:00,282
Knees up, knees up!
Go, go! Go! Let's get it.

458
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:04,286
Yes, Chloe. Nice. Amy!

459
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,414
What are you doing?

460
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,291
I'm doing horizontal running.

461
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:10,668
Horizontal running?

462
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,096
No.

463
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,474
No, no.

464
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,395
No.

465
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,006
I know... I can do it.

466
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,727
Five, six, seven, eight.

467
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:15,441
Okay, I'm calling it.

468
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,986
Thank God.
I asked to go to the bathroom three hours ago.

469
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:22,323
Nothing. I hear nothing.

470
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,577
Hey, Aubrey. Did we just learn the
same choreography from that video?

471
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,622
Okay. Don't forget to pick up
your performance schedules.

472
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:33,584
We have a gig next week.
That's right. Next week.

473
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,462
You guys, it's the Sigma Beta
Theta's Annual Fall Mixer.

474
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:39,006
Okay. Hands in, Bellas.

475
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,385
Hands in, a-ca-bitches! Okay.

476
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:46,096
Sing "" on three...

477
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:52,603
No, no, no. It's actually
on three, Fat Amy.

478
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:56,482
All right. On three.

479
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,108
One, two...

480
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,157
Okay, we will work on that
first thing next time.

481
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,368
Okay, guys. Thank you. Goodbye.

482
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,786
She has man hands.

483
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,496
Beca, a word?

484
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:12,373
What's up?

485
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,377
You know you'll have to take those ear
monstrosities out for the Fall Mixer.

486
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:17,920
You really don't
like me, do you?

487
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,464
I don't like your attitude.
You don't even know me.

488
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,383
I know you have
a toner for Jesse.

489
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,009
A what?

490
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,636
A toner.

491
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,639
A musical boner. I saw it at Hood Night.
It's distracting.

492
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:32,559
Yeah, that's not a thing and
you're not the boss of me. So...

493
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,311
You took an oath.

494
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,022
That oath cost you two
girls already today.

495
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:38,899
I'm pretty sure you need
me more than I need you.

496
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,571
I can see your toner
through those jeans.

497
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,991
That's my dick.

498
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:50,953
Everything okay?

499
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:54,081
We better have our
shit together for SBT.

500
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:58,002
I'm not worried. I think
we're gonna be a-ca-awesome.

501
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:24,236
This makes my beer taste bad.

502
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,702
I'm gonna stop this.

503
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,623
Whoa, whoa. Just stop. Stop.

504
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,670
I am so sorry, Howie. I know
we're not performance ready.

505
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:45,632
I wanted the hot Bellas,
not this barnyard explosion.

506
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:49,219
I'm not paying for this. Let's go.
Come on. God.

507
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,805
Well, I hope you all remember
the way you feel right now,

508
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,016
so you will never wanna
feel this way again.

509
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,686
Chloe, your voice didn't
sound Aguilerian at all.

510
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:00,731
Chloe, for serious,
what is wrong with you?

511
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,191
I have nodes.

512
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:05,736
What? My God.
I found out this morning.

513
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,613
What are nodes?

514
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,198
Vocal nodules.

515
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:12,326
The rubbing together of your vocal
cords at above-average rates

516
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,078
without proper lubrication.

517
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,330
They sit on your windpipe
and they crush your dreams.

518
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:19,333
Isn't that painful?
Why would you keep performing?

519
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,418
Because I love to sing.

520
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:24,088
Yeah, it's like when my lady doctor
told me not to have sex for six weeks,

521
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,380
and I did it anyway.

522
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:28,133
You should really
listen to your doctor.

523
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,303
The key is early diagnosis.

524
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,223
I am living with nodes.

525
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,600
But I am a survivor.

526
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:40,395
I just have to pull back.
Because I am limited.

527
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,565
Because I have nodes.

528
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,526
Chloe, this is horrible.

529
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,444
Well, at least it's not herpes.

530
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,532
Or do you have that as well?

531
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,618
Jesse? Yeah.

532
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,328
I'm starving, so could you...

533
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,746
You want me to get you lunch?

534
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:41,874
You should probably
lay off the burgers.

535
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,959
You're not gonna
be 22 forever, you know.

536
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,588
Yeah, I think I'm good.

537
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,756
He's good. You're good.

538
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,843
And the chess match continues.

539
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,516
Hey, this is my new mix,

540
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,602
so if there's anything
you wanted to play...

541
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,353
Yeah, okay, I'll
put it on the pile.

542
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,980
Okay.

543
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:12,070
What's up, weirdo?

544
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,697
Okay.

545
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,285
What's this? As much as I love

546
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,579
spending time with you stacking CDs...
And I do.

547
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,831
I love it, like,
more than life.

548
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,917
I figured we could do
some other fun things

549
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,877
that don't make us wanna
kill ourselves, right?

550
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,504
Yeah. So, brought some movies.

551
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:35,719
Jaws, E.T., The Breakfast
Club, Star Wars and Rocky.

552
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,597
Best scored and soundtracked
movies of all time.

553
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,975
That's what I wanna do when I grow up.
I wanna score movies.

554
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,936
Bring people to tears,
you know. Blow their minds.

555
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,647
I feel like only
music can do that.

556
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:48,065
Yeah.

557
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,691
You must really sweep
your girlfriend off her feet.

558
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,109
I don't have a girlfriend.

559
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,361
What? No.

560
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,738
You have juice
pouches and Rocky.

561
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,282
Okay, so what do you
wanna watch first?

562
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:58,492
Wanna do something else?

563
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,245
We could relive
my parents' divorce.

564
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,663
Or visit a gynecologist.

565
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,873
What, do you not like
movies or something?

566
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,542
Like, any movies? You don't...

567
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:11,129
What the hell is wrong with you?
How do you not like movies?

568
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:14,007
Not liking movies is like
not liking puppies.

569
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,551
They're fine. I just get bored
and never make it to the end.

570
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,929
The endings are the best part.

571
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,890
They're predictable.
Like, the guy gets the girl,

572
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:25,644
and that kid sees dead people and
Darth Vader is Luke's father.

573
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:29,439
Okay, right, so you just happened to guess
the biggest cinematic reveal in history?

574
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:32,109
"Vader" in German means father.

575
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,695
His name is literally
"Darth Father."

576
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:36,530
Huh.

577
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:38,365
So, you know German.

578
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,326
Well, now I know
why you don't like fun things.

579
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:43,495
You know, you need
a movie education.

580
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,914
You need a movie-cation.
And I'm gonna give it to you.

581
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,834
Yeah, in between Bella
rehearsals, which are always.

582
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:50,836
Are you guys getting
ready for the riff-off?

583
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,714
What the hell is a riff-off?

584
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,135
Hit it!

585
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,516
Welcome to the riff-off!

586
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:08,729
Who's ready to get vocal?

587
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:12,566
The winners get
the greatest prize of all.

588
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,650
I'm taking you down.

589
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:15,485
- The microphone used by Hoobastank...
- I don't care.

590
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,155
When they rocked out at the
Schnee Performing Arts Center.

591
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,742
Let's see our first category.

592
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,042

00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:51,938
I'll be yours till
the end of time.

598
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:55,525
'Cause you made me feel.

599
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:59,279
Yeah, you made me feel.

600
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:02,032
So shiny and new.

601
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:04,701
Like a virgin.

602
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:05,911
Okay, guys.

603
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:11,416
Touched for the very first time.

00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:26,139
Why don't you hit me
with your best shot.

608
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:30,227
Hit me with your best shot.

609
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,938
Fire away.

610
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:37,901
It must have been love.

611
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:42,823
But it's over now.

612
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:45,992
But it's over right now.

613
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:48,662
The negative side effects
of medical marijuana, folks.

614
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:49,871
You are...

615
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,540

And I guess it's just
the woman in you.

That brings out the man in me

637
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:10,035
I know I can't help myself.

638
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:13,538

Each and every day,
true player way

Okay.

658
00:48:17,687 --> 00:48:19,312

It's a tough blow, ladies.

673
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:08,361
The word you needed to match was
"it." And you sang, "it's."

674
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:11,072
You are... Cut off!

On the TV. On a regional
cable affiliate.

682
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:34,346
Before everybody
goes to bed tonight,

683
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:36,097
I need you to make a list
of everything you did wrong.

684
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:38,266
I'm gonna melt that
Cabbage Patch Kid.

685
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:40,977
Hey, guys, what we just
did was great, right?

686
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:43,188
Calm your pits, Beca.
We still lost.

687
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,149
Yeah, but it was spontaneous.
It was awesome.

688
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,192
We were actually
listening to...

689
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:48,652
Okay, everybody, hands in.

690
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:50,236
"" On my count.

691
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,322
On three or after three?
On three.

692
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,990
After three. One, two, three.

693
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:55,075
That's not how we do it.

694
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,243
Why can't we figure this out?

695
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,833
So, I just find songs that have
the same chord progressions

696
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,752
and create a track that
blends them together.

697
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,296
So, like, this is
the new bass line,

698
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:11,591
and this is matching
up downbeats.

699
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,428
I'm talking really loud.

700
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,764
That's me singing.

701
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:30,193
This is really good.

702
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,320
Now I'm the one yelling, right?

703
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,782
That is amazing, Beca.

704
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:37,826
Thanks.

705
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,037
So, I brought this over,

706
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:44,165
because I wanna watch you
watch the end of this movie.

707
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:47,043
And then I can die a hero.

708
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,007
Wait, actually...

709
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,594
You have a habit of making yourself
at home, did you know that?

710
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:57,804
Yeah.

711
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:06,980
Okay.

712
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,817
The Breakfast Club. 1985.

713
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,153
Greatest ending
to any movie ever.

714
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:16,531
This song launched
Simple Minds in the US.

715
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,117
Could have been a Billy ldol
song, but he turned it down.

716
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:20,535
Idiot.

717
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:25,039
Perfectly sums up the movie.
It's equally beautiful and sad.

718
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,418
That is fascinating.

719
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:29,669
Right?

720
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:33,131
Tell me, what does Judd
Nelson eat for breakfast?

721
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:36,843
Well, like all misunderstood
rebels, he feeds on hypocrisy.

722
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:37,969
Sure.

723
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:41,222
And black coffee to help
with his morning dumps.

724
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:43,600
You're an idiot.

725
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,769
It's true. I'm full
of fun facts.

726
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:47,937
You should let other people
tell you they're fun.

727
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:49,022
And an athlete.

728
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,441
And a basket case.

729
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,901
A princess.

730
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,527
And a criminal.

731
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,946
Does that answer
your question?

732
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,617
Sincerely yours,
the Breakfast Club.

733
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:07,040
You're missing the ending.

734
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,291
Sorry.

735
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:21,638
It's good. I'm sure
the beginning is...

736
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,017
The white girl is back.

737
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:31,731
And I'm out.

738
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:37,529
Always a pleasure, Kimmy Jin.

739
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,742
So... Excuse me. Excuse me.

740
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:00,426
I should have taken that
cardio tip more seriously.

741
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:01,678
How much have you done?

742
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:03,054
You just saw it.

743
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,265
Chloe, you gotta be
able to hit that last note.

744
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,058
I can't. It's impossible.

745
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,935
And it's because of
my, my nodes.

746
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,186
Her nodes. Her nodes.

747
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:13,106
Well, if you can't do it, then
someone else needs to solo.

748
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,733
I think Beca should
take my solo.

749
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:18,069
Yeah, Beca would be excellent.

750
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:21,865
But also, someone else
might be equally as excellent.

751
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,535
It's true.
And they might be shy

752
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,037
and not wanna come forward
and say they wanted a solo.

753
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:31,541
Well, Beca doesn't
want a solo, so...

754
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,042
I would be happy to do it

755
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:34,794
if I got to pick a new song
and do an arrangement.

756
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:36,713
Well, that's not how
we run things here.

757
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,799
Aubrey, maybe Beca has a point.
Maybe we could try something new.

758
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:40,967
A-ca-scuse me?

759
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:45,763
You can sing Turn the Beat Around and
that's the last I wanna hear of this.

760
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:49,517
That song is tired.
We're not gonna win with it.

761
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:51,185
If we pull samples
from different genres

762
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:52,603
and layer them together,
we could make some...

763
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:55,648
Okay, let me explain something to you
because you still don't seem to get it.

764
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:59,319
Our goal is to get back to the finals
and these songs will get us there.

765
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,948
So, excuse me if I don't take advice from
some alt-girl with her mad lib beats,

766
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:05,909
because she's never even
been in competition.

767
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:07,285
Have I made myself clear?

768
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,662
Crystal. I won't solo.

769
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:11,372
Fine.

770
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,708
Fat Amy? Yes, sir?

771
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,084
You'll solo.

772
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:19,631
Yes! Yes.

773
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,403
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

774
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:46,491
The 2012 southeastern regional
competition has officially begun.

775
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,701
Yes, I'm Gail Abernathy McCadd,

776
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:51,245
and to my right is fellow a
cappella alum John Smith

777
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,165
and we are live from
Carolina University.

778
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,501
It's a new season
for a cappella.

779
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:59,504
The regionals begin the
long road to Lincoln Center

780
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:02,465
where all of these youngsters
hope to one day win a trophy

781
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,550
by making music
with their mouths.

782
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:19,899
A cappella out of
sock puppets? Genius.

783
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:22,276
Yeah, look at the black
one with the white sock.

784
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:23,486
It's making a statement.

785
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,239
There's no craft there. Watching
them will make you worse.

786
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,907
At least they're different.

787
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:33,162
And the Sockappellas,
once again proving

788
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:36,958
that it doesn't get better for
everyone after high school.

789
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:50,930
Do we clap?

790
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:52,098
No, we don't. Never.

791
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,770
Hands in.

792
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,858
Remember, "" on three.

793
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:03,526
One, two...

794
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,902
Wait, you said we'd...

795
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,196
I'm sorry.

796
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:09,115
It's okay,
it's gonna be okay. Okay.

797
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,075
Let's give it up
for the Barden Bellas!

798
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,205
Wow.

799
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:22,628
This does not look like the fresh-faced
nubile Bellas that we have come to know.

800
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:26,174
Is it me or are those skirts
just not working anymore?

801
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:27,925
You're walking the line, John.

802
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:31,554
It's a nice surprise to see
the Bellas mixing it up.

803
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:35,016
It's refreshing, yet
displeasing to the eye.

804
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,941
One, two, three, four.

805
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,245
The Barden Bellas
bringing back

806
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:59,082
the same song they sang
at last year's finals.

807
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:02,251
And all eyes will be on
senior Aubrey Posen.

808
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:04,253
She could toss some
cookies at any moment.

809
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:30,446
And she makes it through, folks.
No cookie toss.

810
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:58,975
John, a change of pace could not come
soon enough here for the Barden Bellas.

811
00:57:59,268 --> 00:58:01,769
This is not a great way
to start their season.

812
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:07,150
Yeah, this number is like an
elephant dart to the public's face.

813
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:17,118
Yeah!

814
00:58:58,493 --> 00:58:59,493
Yes.

815
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:08,794
Yeah, Fat Amy.

816
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:10,421
Boo!

817
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:13,591
The Barden Bellas went deep into
the archive for that song, John.

818
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,927
I remember singing it
with my own a cappella group.

819
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:17,470
And what group was that, Gail?

820
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,763
The Minstrel Cycles, John.

821
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:21,098
Well, that's an
unfortunate name.

822
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:24,477
Thank you. Really incredible.

823
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:27,438
The Barden Bellas. Thank you.

824
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:32,443
That was great.

825
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,569
Amazing.

826
00:59:33,654 --> 00:59:36,572
You know, there must be something in the
water over there at Barden University,

827
00:59:36,657 --> 00:59:38,157
'cause this next group
is also from Barden.

828
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:43,037
Ladies and gentlemen, the
Barden University Treblemakers.

829
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:47,083
Here we go, the Barden Treblemakers. They're
on the trail for Lincoln Center, huh?

830
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,210
Absolutely, they
always are, Gail.

831
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:52,088
My favorite, and
everyone's favorite.

832
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:55,424
Now it says here in my notes that
their front man Bumper Allen

833
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:59,095
has recently released his
own line of sports sandals.

834
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:02,014
Shh!

835
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:31,460
Boy, the bad boys of a cappella
have just gotten badder.

836
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:32,670
Whoo! That's right, John.

837
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:35,798
I'm gonna have to excuse myself
to freshen up the downtown.

838
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,049
Can I help?

839
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:06,329
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

840
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:09,749
The results of tonight's
regional competition.

841
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:12,752
In third place,
the Sockappellas!

842
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:18,007
Yeah, lucky you.
In second place,

843
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:21,969
and advancing to this year's
semi-finals, the Barden Bellas.

844
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:23,512
Yeah.

845
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:25,765
Yes!

846
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:27,266
Awesome.

847
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:28,976
Nice. Nice.

848
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:30,186
Hey,

849
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:33,356
And the winner of tonight's
regional competition,

850
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,649
defending their crown,
ladies and gentlemen,

851
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:38,235
the Barden University
Treblemakers!

852
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,737
Way to go, Trebles.

853
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,617
Yes! Yes!

854
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,454
That's right!

855
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:29,078
I'm willing to sign breasts.
Yes! I'm willing to sign...

856
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:32,998
Look who it is. Old dudes.

857
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,834
Get a life.

858
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:36,710
Sonic boom.

859
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:38,421
Just 'cause we graduated
a few years ago,

860
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:41,382
doesn't mean we can't still get off
performing our oral magic, all right?

861
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:42,466
Oral magic?

862
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:44,468
Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy, buddy.

863
01:02:44,553 --> 01:02:45,995
Are you looking for what I
think you're looking for?

864
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,346
Yeah, a fight?
You looking for a fight?

865
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:49,140
Please, please. Please say
you're looking for a fight.

866
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:52,101
Please, please say
you're looking for a fight.

867
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,437
Yes! I will fight.

868
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:56,689
I would fight him,

869
01:02:56,773 --> 01:03:00,860
but I tore a quad within
the midst of the dance...

870
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:03,195
Hey, Gandhi. Hey, you, are
we doing this or what?

871
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,280
Hit me. What?

872
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:05,489
Let's get it on!

873
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:08,617
Mmm-mmm.

874
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:11,328
I've wrestled crocodiles
and dingoes simultaneously.

875
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:12,625
Come here! Why do you
want me to hit you?

876
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:13,747
I don't wanna do that.

877
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:16,125
I need to feel something.
Hit me as hard as you can.

878
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,919
Hit me hard. Take this. Take this.
I want you to hit me with it.

879
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:21,046
I'm just gonna...
I'm just gonna check on them.

880
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:24,341
The kraken has been unleashed.
Feel the Fat Amy force!

881
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:28,137
Hey.

882
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,890
My God. My gosh.

883
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:33,934
That's fantastic!

884
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:35,728
Amy, don't. Amy!
Feel the fat power.

885
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,189
Fat Amy! Kick me in the balls!

886
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:40,691
Amy!

887
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:43,652
Give me the sharp weapon,
I wanna put it up his butt!

888
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:45,571
Ooh! Cherry on top.

889
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:52,453
Which way are you running?

890
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,246
This way. This way. All right.

891
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:55,956
Beautiful.

892
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:57,416
Amy!

893
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:58,751
Vertical running.

894
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,503
I'm vertical running.

895
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:03,964
Hey, Hilary Swank from
Million Dollar Baby.

896
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:07,301
Hey, you know you just have to
say, "Hey, Million Dollar Baby."

897
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:10,137
You don't have to reference
the specific actress.

898
01:04:10,222 --> 01:04:12,389
Damn. Prison changed you.

899
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,683
Thanks for bailing me out.

900
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:15,768
Well, I didn't.

901
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:17,603
You called my dad?

902
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,772
I know, I know, but they were
putting you in handcuffs, Bec.

903
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:20,940
It looked pretty serious.

904
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:22,525
That doesn't mean
you call my dad.

905
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:24,735
Who else was I gonna call? Okay,
why are you yelling at me?

906
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:25,903
I'm the only one here.

907
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,905
I didn't ask you to be.

908
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:29,823
I was just trying to help you.

909
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:32,243
I don't need your help,
you're not my boyfriend.

910
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,161
Got it.

911
01:04:34,246 --> 01:04:36,080
Dad, it's not a big deal.
Yeah, it's a big deal.

912
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:37,706
I get a call in the
middle of the night

913
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:40,834
saying my daughter's been arrested
for destruction of property.

914
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:43,629
It was a misunderstanding and
I was protecting my friends.

915
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,298
I was putting myself
out there. Making memories.

916
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:49,885
If you think I'm paying for you to
go to LA after a stunt like this,

917
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:51,428
I'm not. Get in the car.

918
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,556
You're not even gonna hear
what I have to say about this?

919
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,391
No, not tonight. Just get in.

920
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:08,654
Hey!

921
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:11,407
What up, Shawshank?

922
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:12,783
Did you get yourself a bitch?

923
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,159
Did they spray you with a hose?

924
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:16,662
I did a turn at County.

925
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,206
You guys waited up for me?

926
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:20,666
Of course we waited up for you.

927
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:24,920
They've been here for hours.
It's a real inconvenience, Beca.

928
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:28,591
Beca, I'm glad you're here.

929
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,302
I'm calling an
emergency Bella meeting.

930
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:32,511
No.

931
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:34,555
First up... Yes.

932
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:37,266
Our score sheet revealed that the
Sockappellas almost beat us.

933
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,936
And Fat Amy, you need to do it
exactly how we rehearsed it, okay?

934
01:05:41,021 --> 01:05:42,021
No surprises.

935
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:44,315
We should be taking risks.
It's not enough to be good,

936
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:46,108
we need to put ourselves
out there, be different.

937
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:49,111
Beca's right. The Trebles never
sing the same song twice.

938
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:51,447
The audience love the
Trebles, they tolerate us.

939
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:54,617
We could change the
face of a cappella if we...

940
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:56,869
My God, that sounded so queerballs.
What's happening to me?

941
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:00,956
Let me show you this arrangement
I've been working on.

942
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:02,791
I didn't know
you were into this stuff.

943
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:03,917
Yeah.

944
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:09,089
Okay, I have the pitch pipe, and I say
that we focus on the set list as planned.

945
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:12,676
From now on, there will be
no more wasting time with work

946
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:16,305
or school or boyfriends
or partners.

947
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,474
Sorry, Cynthia Rose.

948
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:21,852
But Aubrey, this stuff
is pretty cool. I mean...

949
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:24,104
Okay. Rehearsal tomorrow,
8:00 a.m. sharp.

950
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:37,701
Hey!

951
01:06:39,371 --> 01:06:42,414
This is my track! You're
playing my song right now!

952
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:45,209
That is awesome! You like it?

953
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:48,128
You put it on the
radio! That is amazing!

954
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:50,172
It's a sick beat.

955
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:53,300
Yeah, I always thought
her beats were pretty sick.

956
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:56,387
Hey, Becky, listen, spring break, I
want you to take the night shift.

957
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:57,513
Play your music.

958
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:02,601
The DJ at the Garage does a brilliant
version of this, but yours? It's better.

959
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:04,186
Yeah, it is.

960
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:07,439
I'm gonna listen to her tonight. I think
you should... You should come with.

961
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:09,066
I have a thing.

962
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:11,193
Flight attendant training?

963
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:15,114
It's Barden Bellas. I have
the semi-finals tonight.

964
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:19,201
Really? I did not have you
pegged as an a cappella girl.

965
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,203
That's 'cause you don't
know Becky like I do.

966
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:22,705
See you tonight.

967
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:42,474
Okay, don't you
flat-butts worry, I got this.

968
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:44,309
I'm just gonna pump and dump.

969
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:46,520
I don't care what you say.

970
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:49,523
Sisqó live, best performance
ever, I've ever seen.

971
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,400
"Thong Song" isn't his only hit.
Yeah.

972
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:56,155
All right? That's serious.

973
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:57,364
Yo, Bump, is that Fat Amy?

974
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,075
Donald, slow down! Slow down!

975
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,910
Yeah! All right!

976
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:05,038
Hey, Amy? Sabotage!

977
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,546
I've been shot.

978
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:17,217
I've just been shot! Help me.

979
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:18,677
Fat Amy!

980
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:21,096
They shot Amy!

981
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:23,015
I've got you. I've got you.

982
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:28,270
No, no, no. I'm talking,
I'm talking... I'm sitting up.

983
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,189
- All right. Cool.
- There's no need for that.

984
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:32,065
No mouth to mouth.

985
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:35,694
Shit. Bumper threw
a big-ass burrito at me.

986
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:40,741
I'm gonna kill him, I swear. I'm
gonna finish him like a cheesecake.

987
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,726
You've got yourself
a little something there.

988
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:10,395
Just leave it.
It fuels my hate fire.

989
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:51,520
My God.

990
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:23,969
It's a... it's...

991
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,141
What the hell?

992
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:33,645
Um... it's pretty cool, actually. L
think we're just running out of gas.

993
01:10:34,022 --> 01:10:35,939
No, that can't be.
You just filled the tank.

994
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:37,816
Yeah, I did.

995
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:43,822
And, yet, maybe I didn't, because
I got hit by flying Mexican food.

996
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:50,787
And we're out.

997
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:52,956
A-ca-scuse me?

998
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:54,708
A-ca-believe it.

999
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:57,169
Man, what are we gonna do?

1000
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,337
Maybe we could call...

1001
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:01,632
No, don't even say it,
Chloe. How dare you?

1002
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:04,843
No, actually that is a really good idea.
I've got Bumper's number.

1003
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:07,262
Why do you have
Bumper's number?

1004
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:19,650
So, Bellas,

1005
01:11:20,068 --> 01:11:24,363
what boring, estrogen-filled set have
you prepared for us this evening?

1006
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,323
Excuse me?

1007
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:29,451
But you guys are gonna get
pitch-slapped so hard

1008
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,161
your man boobs are
gonna concave.

1009
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:36,249
Nine miles, guys.

1010
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:47,886
That's pretty good.

1011
01:11:49,389 --> 01:11:51,390
I set fires to feel joy.

1012
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:54,059
That's adorable.

1013
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:16,873
Five minutes, Bellas.

1014
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:18,834
Where did he come from? Shh!

1015
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:22,587
It's over. There's no way we can
beat the Footnotes and the Trebles.

1016
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:54,202
Whoo! That little
peanut can sing.

1017
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:57,581
He really can. It sounds to me, though,
Gail, like his boys haven't dropped yet,

1018
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:58,874
if you know what I mean.

1019
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:02,502
If you mean his testicles, then I do, John.
I do. I really do.

1020
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:03,962
A-ca-huddle, now.

1021
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:07,716
The top two teams go to the finals,
so we just have to beat one of them.

1022
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:12,471
And if we do it exactly how we rehearsed
it, we will get there, okay? Exactly.

1023
01:13:15,475 --> 01:13:16,558
Hands in.

1024
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:19,352
On three
or after three?

1025
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:21,146
Screw it. Let's just do it.

1026
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,815
Put your hands together
for the Barden Bellas!

1027
01:13:25,193 --> 01:13:27,027
Okay, the Bellas
are coming out.

1028
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:31,490
Another step in this
competition and...

1029
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:34,743
One, two, three, four...

1030
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:39,539
Here we go again.

1031
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:41,541
Looks like they're
sticking with what they know.

1032
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:30,924
A little tension on
the stage tonight.

1033
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:32,384
Claws are out.

1034
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:36,138
This is just friendly
collegiate fun.

1035
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:39,099
It's a tough competition, but we're
all here to have a good time.

1036
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:42,519
That's right, John. But a mistake can
haunt you for the rest of your life

1037
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:43,687
and affect your children.

1038
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:53,196
What the hell, Beca? Were
you trying to screw us up?

1039
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:54,531
Are you serious?

1040
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:56,783
Newsflash. This
isn't the Beca show.

1041
01:14:56,868 --> 01:14:59,327
Okay, I'm sorry
that I messed you up,

1042
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:02,289
but in case you hadn't noticed, everybody
pretty much dozed off during our set.

1043
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:05,000
It's not your job to decide
what we do and when we do it.

1044
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:09,254
Why don't you ask the rest of the group how
they felt about your little improvisation?

1045
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:13,383
Amy?

1046
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:19,181
It was cool. But it did take
us a little bit by surprise.

1047
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:21,057
Yeah, a lot by surprise.

1048
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:22,851
A little.

1049
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:26,021
I told you she wasn't a Bella.
Aubrey, don't.

1050
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:28,356
No, that's okay.
You don't have to pretend

1051
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:30,317
you're allowed to have a
say in the group, right?

1052
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:33,028
Your attitude sucks. You're
a grade-A pain in my ass,

1053
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:34,362
and I know you're
hooking up with Jesse.

1054
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:36,781
Whoa. Whoa. Aubrey, calm down.
We're not hooking up, I swear.

1055
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:40,702
Jesus Christ! That's perfect. Of
course you're here right now.

1056
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:44,080
I don't need your help,
okay? Can you back off?

1057
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:46,499
Trebles.
Time to bring the pain.

1058
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:50,629
If this is what
I get for trying...

1059
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:54,925
Beca? Beca, wait.

1060
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:01,348
Aubrey, it actually
went really well.

1061
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:02,724
Chloe, stop!

1062
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:04,559
Excuse me. My God. Okay.

1063
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:08,563
Beca? Beca, wait.

1064
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:24,955
And the Treblemakers
seal the deal tonight.

1065
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:28,625
Unfortunately, Barden's other
group, the Bellas, do not advance,

1066
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:33,505
and senior Aubrey Posen loses her chance to
redeem herself from last year's Pukegate.

1067
01:16:41,973 --> 01:16:43,723
Happy spring break.

1068
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:45,392
Thanks.

1069
01:18:11,062 --> 01:18:14,898
In the simplest terms, in
the most convenient definitions.

1070
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:19,027
But what we found out is that
each one of us is a brain.

1071
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:20,695
And an athlete.

1072
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,655
And a basket case.

1073
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:23,907
A princess.

1074
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:25,617
And a criminal.

1075
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,036
Does that answer
your question?

1076
01:18:28,788 --> 01:18:31,581
Sincerely yours,
the Breakfast Club.

1077
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:45,637
My God.

1078
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:48,807
Okay.

1079
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:02,570
We are from the Collegiate
A Cappella Association.

1080
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:06,324
It has come to our attention
that you are not in college.

1081
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:08,410
Ls this your mother?

1082
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:21,297
This is Aubrey Posen.

1083
01:19:24,844 --> 01:19:27,178
Yes, thank you, sir.

1084
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:31,474
I look forward to seeing
you again at Lincoln Center.

1085
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:34,978
Yes!

1086
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:50,076
Aubrey?

1087
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:03,756
I'm all in, bitches.

1088
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:21,524
Okay. The a-ca-gods have looked down on us
and they have given us a second chance.

1089
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:22,817
Shalom!

1090
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:23,985
I texted Beca.

1091
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:25,278
You did what?

1092
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:26,404
She makes us better.

1093
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:28,490
That's not an opinion
for you to have, Chloe.

1094
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:30,158
Why? Because it's not yours?

1095
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:31,826
You're not always
right, you know.

1096
01:20:31,911 --> 01:20:33,661
We will win without her.

1097
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:47,425
- Jesse, I know you're in there.
- I can smell popcorn.

1098
01:20:48,636 --> 01:20:50,595
Jesse, come on. Open up.

1099
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:02,732
Hey. I tried to call you. L
left you a bunch of messages.

1100
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:04,275
Yeah, I got them.

1101
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:06,653
I'm sorry that we fought.

1102
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:09,322
I was mad and I overreacted
and I'm just...

1103
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:10,615
Aubrey makes me crazy.

1104
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:11,908
Seriously?

1105
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:15,286
You think I'm mad
because you yelled at me?

1106
01:21:16,163 --> 01:21:17,247
No, I know...

1107
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:20,750
No, you don't. You think
you know, but you don't.

1108
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:26,005
You push away anyone who could
possibly care about you. Why is that?

1109
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:28,925
I don't know.

1110
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,971
Well, you better figure it out
because I'm done with...

1111
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:35,265
Whatever this is.

1112
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:36,808
Jesse... I'm done.

1113
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:55,493
Women.

1114
01:21:55,995 --> 01:21:57,078
Yeah.

1115
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:00,582
Okay, stop.

1116
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:02,333
What is happening to us?

1117
01:22:02,585 --> 01:22:05,420
Chloe, you sound like
you smoke three packs a day.

1118
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:07,964
Stacie, you are so
behind on choreography.

1119
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:11,759
And Jessica and Ashley, it is like
you haven't been here all year long.

1120
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:12,885
Aubrey, really?

1121
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:14,262
We've literally been
here the whole time.

1122
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:17,348
Aubrey, please,
just give us a break.

1123
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:19,601
It's kind of not the same
without everyone here.

1124
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:21,019
We need Beca.

1125
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:23,062
Maybe if Aubrey loosened
the reins a little bit.

1126
01:22:23,147 --> 01:22:24,355
Okay, shut it, Chloe!

1127
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:25,440
Whoa!

1128
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:28,192
I'm sorry. That was rude.

1129
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:31,571
Chloe, could you please get your head
out of your ass? It's not a hat.

1130
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,576
A-ca-awkward.

1131
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:38,620
Again.

1132
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:46,711
No one was more surprised than me,
but I really liked those girls.

1133
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:49,922
And you thought
quitting was the answer?

1134
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:52,050
Seriously? You can
say that to me?

1135
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:54,427
Come on, Bec, that's so unfair.

1136
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:58,306
Look, your mom and I,
we didn't work.

1137
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:01,476
But I tried so hard to make
things right between us.

1138
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:03,645
But you, you just shut me out.

1139
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:06,981
Yeah, well, I shut everybody
out. Don't take it personally.

1140
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:08,191
It's just easier.

1141
01:23:08,776 --> 01:23:10,735
It's also really lonely.

1142
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:18,409
What do I do?

1143
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:20,745
Well, that's up to you.

1144
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:26,334
Trebles, listen up!

1145
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:29,545
If this is about the Bellas getting
into the finals, we already know.

1146
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:31,297
I don't give a crap
about those dumb bitches.

1147
01:23:31,382 --> 01:23:34,342
Because I'm being brought up
to the musical big leagues.

1148
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:35,426
What are you talking about?

1149
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:39,263
John Mayer just asked me,
personally, through an assistant,

1150
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:42,141
to sing backup on his new CD.

1151
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:46,729
I leave for Los Angeles in a few
hours, so I gotta get going.

1152
01:23:46,814 --> 01:23:49,023
But Bumper, what about the lCCAs?
They're this weekend.

1153
01:23:49,108 --> 01:23:54,487
Sorry, buddies, but I won that shit
like 100 times, so I'm out of here.

1154
01:23:54,571 --> 01:23:57,365
Got a collarless leather jacket to buy.
Maybe some aviators.

1155
01:23:57,449 --> 01:23:59,075
I might get an earring,
I don't know.

1156
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:02,370
It's Los Angeles. This is exciting stuff.
My life rules!

1157
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:05,998
Bumper's a jerk. All
right, I said it. Yeah.

1158
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:08,126
Well, he's a jerk that we
need to replace. Yeah.

1159
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:09,877
Pronto dente.

1160
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:11,963
You know he writes
his own fan mail.

1161
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,929
Spot opened up, and
it's yours if you want it.

1162
01:24:20,013 --> 01:24:23,558
Just one condition. Promise
me you won't get all weird.

1163
01:24:23,642 --> 01:24:27,019
We're just a group of guys singing
a bunch of covers of songs, okay?

1164
01:24:27,104 --> 01:24:29,939
If you get weird, they will
definitely not let you stay.

1165
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:33,568
Deal. Although I don't know
what you mean by weird.

1166
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,279
Got it.

1167
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:39,615
I have been there for you for so many
years, and all you do is treat me like...

1168
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,493
All right, no, okay,
just shut up! Everyone!

1169
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:46,372
Come on, I joined this group so I could hang
out with a bunch of really cool chicks.

1170
01:24:46,457 --> 01:24:48,583
And also 'cause I was really
sick of all my boyfriends

1171
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:50,835
and I need to get
away from that.

1172
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:53,880
But this is some
serious horseshit.

1173
01:24:54,882 --> 01:24:57,675
What's that smell?
Stinks everywhere.

1174
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,303
I don't wanna be
like the old Bellas.

1175
01:25:00,387 --> 01:25:02,722
Yeah, I wanna be
how we are now.

1176
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:05,475
Me, too.

1177
01:25:05,559 --> 01:25:06,976
We should have
listened to Beca.

1178
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,770
So it's my fault?

1179
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:09,854
That's not what I'm saying.

1180
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:12,148
No, no, no, that's what
you're all thinking, isn't it?

1181
01:25:12,232 --> 01:25:16,152
That I'm the jerk. I am the
girl obsessed with winning.

1182
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:19,614
Aubrey, you're too controlling
and it's gonna ruin all of us.

1183
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:22,825
You know what, I can lose
control if I want to.

1184
01:25:22,910 --> 01:25:26,954
I can let go. This time I'm
not gonna choke it down.

1185
01:25:37,216 --> 01:25:40,218
Come on, bring it!
You can do better than that!

1186
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:41,594
That's all you got?

1187
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:44,096
Enough! Enough!

1188
01:25:47,935 --> 01:25:49,477
We could have been champions!

1189
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:53,648
Give me the pitch
pipe, you bitch!

1190
01:25:54,233 --> 01:25:55,691
Give it to me!

1191
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:59,779
Give it to me! Give it to me!

1192
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:00,905
Never!

1193
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:02,490
I'll protect you.
I'll protect you.

1194
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:03,908
Hands off the goodies!

1195
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:20,591
Move, you bitches!

1196
01:26:27,724 --> 01:26:28,808
Guys!

1197
01:26:29,852 --> 01:26:31,769
Guys, stop! What is going on?

1198
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:43,155
Nothing. Nothing.
This is a Bellas rehearsal.

1199
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,575
I know. I just

1200
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:49,120
wanted to say that I'm sorry.

1201
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:53,374
What I did was
a really dick move

1202
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:56,878
and I shouldn't have changed the
set without asking you guys.

1203
01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:58,462
And I definitely
shouldn't have left.

1204
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:02,383
I let you guys down
and I'm really sorry.

1205
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:06,387
And...

1206
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:11,434
Aubrey, if you would
have me, I want back in.

1207
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:36,792
Aubrey.

1208
01:27:46,845 --> 01:27:47,887
Wait.

1209
01:27:47,971 --> 01:27:49,764
Thank you. That would
have been embarrassing.

1210
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:54,477
Beca, I know that I've
been hard on you, okay?

1211
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:59,106
I know that I have been
hard on everyone here.

1212
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:03,069
But I am my father's daughter.

1213
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:09,784
And he always said, "if at
first you don't succeed",

1214
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:13,704
"pack your bags."

1215
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:19,293
Jesus. That's really crazy.

1216
01:28:20,921 --> 01:28:23,965
I get it. Mine gets on me, too.

1217
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:25,883
Not like that, but...

1218
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:29,553
I guess we don't really know
that much about each other.

1219
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:32,848
About most of you, really.

1220
01:28:33,392 --> 01:28:37,144
Well, I'll confess something
that none of you know about me.

1221
01:28:38,772 --> 01:28:40,189
I have a lot of sex.

1222
01:28:40,273 --> 01:28:41,565
Yeah, we know, Stacie.

1223
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:44,026
Only 'cause I just told you.

1224
01:28:44,111 --> 01:28:45,236
This is a good idea.

1225
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:48,447
That was a pretty bad example,
but this is a good idea.

1226
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:52,827
Why don't we all go
around the room,

1227
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:57,748
and we can all say something about
ourselves that nobody else knows.

1228
01:28:58,417 --> 01:29:00,543
Okay, I got something.

1229
01:29:00,919 --> 01:29:03,713
This is hard for me to
admit to you guys.

1230
01:29:03,922 --> 01:29:07,550
I think we all know where this
is going. Let's be honest.

1231
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:13,806
Well, for the last two
years, I've had a serious

1232
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:15,725
gambling problem.

1233
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:17,268
What? What?

1234
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:19,520
It started when I broke
up with my girlfriend.

1235
01:29:19,813 --> 01:29:21,605
Whoomp! There it is.

1236
01:29:25,402 --> 01:29:26,944
I still love you.

1237
01:29:31,992 --> 01:29:33,451
Anyone else?

1238
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:38,414
I ate my twin in the womb.

1239
01:29:40,292 --> 01:29:41,417
What?

1240
01:29:44,755 --> 01:29:45,796
Okay.

1241
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:48,883
Fat Amy?

1242
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:51,093
I'm an open book.

1243
01:29:51,178 --> 01:29:53,721
I mean, for God's sake,
you guys all call me Fat Amy.

1244
01:29:54,973 --> 01:29:59,935
See, I guess I'm just not really
living if I'm not being 100% honest.

1245
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:05,524
And my real name
is Fat Patricia.

1246
01:30:06,777 --> 01:30:08,069
What?

1247
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:13,199
Okay. I've never been
one of those girls

1248
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:17,828
who had a lot of friends
who were girls. And I do now.

1249
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:21,165
And that's pretty cool.

1250
01:30:24,169 --> 01:30:26,754
So, that's me.
Someone else please go.

1251
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:30,007
Okay.

1252
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:38,432
Over spring break, I made the
courageous decision to remove my nodes.

1253
01:30:40,018 --> 01:30:44,939
I know. The doctor said that
I can't sing above a G-sharp,

1254
01:30:45,899 --> 01:30:47,274
maybe ever.

1255
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:51,028
I thought the season was over.

1256
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:57,201
It's okay. It's okay.

1257
01:30:59,496 --> 01:31:02,540
Beca, what do we do?

1258
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:13,592
I'm sorry.

1259
01:31:14,386 --> 01:31:15,511
Maybe not here.

1260
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:19,431
All right. Let's
remix this business.

1261
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:25,020
Aubrey, would you
pick a song for us, please?

1262
01:31:25,105 --> 01:31:27,606
Bruno Mars,
Just The Way You Are.

1263
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:32,444
Okay. Chloe, are you
okay to take the lead?

1264
01:31:32,529 --> 01:31:33,571
Yeah.

1265
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:19,343
Hands in.

1266
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:25,432
One, two...

1267
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:28,435
What was that?

1268
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,187
I don't know, I've never
made that sound before.

1269
01:33:30,272 --> 01:33:33,107
Yo, but with your messed up vocal
cords, you could hit the bass notes.

1270
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:35,192
Do you know what that means?

1271
01:33:35,277 --> 01:33:36,485
Yes, Lilly?

1272
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:38,696
I think I have something
that can help us out.

1273
01:33:39,906 --> 01:33:42,032
Excuse me, bitch, you
don't need to shout.

1274
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,159
Okay, don't get mouthy.

1275
01:33:59,676 --> 01:34:00,968
Welcome to the finals

1276
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:04,930
of the 2012 international
Championship of Collegiate A Cappella.

1277
01:34:05,515 --> 01:34:09,101
Lincoln Center is proud to welcome back
all of these young hopefuls tonight

1278
01:34:09,185 --> 01:34:12,813
who are hoping to win a trophy by
making music with their mouths.

1279
01:34:20,613 --> 01:34:23,198
This is gonna be a big
night, and I tell you, Gail,

1280
01:34:23,325 --> 01:34:26,160
if you can just shut your eyes.
I'm doing it.

1281
01:34:26,244 --> 01:34:29,371
Shut your eyes and get rid
of all the a-ca-politics,

1282
01:34:29,581 --> 01:34:33,834
then you can remember that being at
Lincoln Center, in the Big Apple,

1283
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:38,589
and singing on this storied stage is
the dream of every a cappella singer.

1284
01:34:38,673 --> 01:34:40,382
You said it, John.

1285
01:34:56,107 --> 01:35:00,402
The University of Virginia
Hullabahoos, ladies and gentlemen.

1286
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:02,404
There they are.

1287
01:35:02,489 --> 01:35:04,281
One, two, three, swag!

1288
01:35:04,366 --> 01:35:08,786
Welcome back to the International
Championship of Collegiate A Cappella.

1289
01:35:09,412 --> 01:35:14,124
This next group, they need no
introduction, but I'll do it anyway!

1290
01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:17,878
Hey.

1291
01:35:17,962 --> 01:35:19,004
Good luck.

1292
01:35:19,756 --> 01:35:21,882
Thanks. You, too.

1293
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:24,718
The Barden University
Treblemakers!

1294
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:11,051
The Trebles closing
it strong like always.

1295
01:38:11,135 --> 01:38:14,930
Absolutely tight. It's gonna be
very hard to beat that tonight.

1296
01:38:15,014 --> 01:38:17,891
Every other group has their
work cut out for them, John.

1297
01:38:17,976 --> 01:38:22,062
I'm glad it's not us anymore, Gail.
Those days are over, thank goodness.

1298
01:38:22,146 --> 01:38:25,232
Especially since they
wouldn't have us back.

1299
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:28,735
All right. How about that?

1300
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:29,945
The Barden University
Treblemakers.

1301
01:38:30,029 --> 01:38:31,113
I love you, awesome nerds.

1302
01:38:31,573 --> 01:38:33,657
Yeah, you guys are the best.

1303
01:38:34,909 --> 01:38:38,996
Even though some of you are pretty thin,
I think that you all have fat hearts,

1304
01:38:39,998 --> 01:38:42,124
and that's what matters.

1305
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:44,501
Okay, let's just
smash this. Okay?

1306
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:49,506
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Barden Bellas!

1307
01:38:51,509 --> 01:38:54,511
My goodness gracious.
Will you look at this?

1308
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:58,557
Gone are those Bella uniforms and
this is a whole new look for them,

1309
01:38:58,641 --> 01:39:00,309
and it is hot, hot, hot.

1310
01:39:00,393 --> 01:39:02,894
John, these
girls could turn me.

1311
01:39:07,692 --> 01:39:10,027
We love you, Bellas!

1312
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:20,704
One, two, three, four.

1313
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:04,511
Way to go, Beca!

1314
01:43:22,113 --> 01:43:23,363
What a show!

1315
01:43:23,447 --> 01:43:27,576
I think we have just seen some a
cappella history being made, John.

1316
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:31,538
And from an all-female group, Gail.
I could never have called this one.

1317
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:34,249
Never. Well, you are
a misogynist at heart,

1318
01:43:34,333 --> 01:43:36,376
so there's no way you would
have bet on these girls to win.

1319
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:37,460
Absolutely.

1320
01:43:41,132 --> 01:43:43,133
Weren't they incredible? Wow!

1321
01:43:45,887 --> 01:43:50,140
Ladies and gentlemen, let's give
it up again for the Barden Bellas!

1322
01:43:52,435 --> 01:43:54,895
Told you. Endings
are the best part.

1323
01:43:54,979 --> 01:43:56,146
You're such a weirdo.

1324
01:44:09,827 --> 01:44:11,620
Listen up, a-ca-ballers.

1325
01:44:11,704 --> 01:44:16,207
I have been rejected by the Army, shoved
into a Dora the Explorer backpack,

1326
01:44:16,292 --> 01:44:19,753
and pushed into the girls' locker
room wearing nothing but suspenders.

1327
01:44:19,837 --> 01:44:22,756
But no matter.
I am in the world that I love.

1328
01:44:23,341 --> 01:44:25,133
And with the assistance
of my boy, Justin...

1329
01:44:25,217 --> 01:44:26,259
My liege.

1330
01:44:26,344 --> 01:44:27,552
I launch this year's auditions.

1331
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:30,847
Belly roll.

1332
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:36,728
The most recent ICCA national champion
winners get to pick the audition song.

1333
01:44:43,361 --> 01:44:46,112
All right, nerds.
Let's go with...

1334
01:46:19,957 --> 01:46:21,541
Because I have nodes.

1335
01:46:21,625 --> 01:46:25,962
Chloe, don't worry, it's just God
punishing you 'cause you're a ginger.
