You walked back?

368
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:16,060
Well, I caught a cargo
plane to Kuala Lumpur,

369
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,529
got on a boat to Pondicherry,

370
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,131
went up India to Nepal,

371
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:21,766
down to Karachi,

372
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:23,401
across the Middle East,

373
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:26,704
North Africa, spent a
little time in Morocco.

374
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,973
I actually lived in
France for quite a while

375
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:32,043
and wound up in New
York ten years later.

376
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,044
Wow.

377
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,745
So you came back an artist.

378
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,948
Yeah, well, I think it was more

379
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:38,616
I was looking for the one thing

380
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,718
that would piss my
father off the most.

381
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,554
Mm. I always envied that
bohemian lifestyle.

382
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,891
I wanted to tramp around
the world and, you know,

383
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,293
drink cheap wine, live in a loft.

384
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:50,761
Wake up and paint?

385
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:53,103
Yes, smoke Gauloises.

386
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:55,766

387
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:59,270
Ah. I... fell in love.

388
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:00,338

389
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:01,339

392
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:07,144
So what did you end up
doing with yourself?

393
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,046
Oh, this and that.

394
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,349
You know, 9 lives, 14 professions,

395
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:14,362
and I stage houses now.

396
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:16,387
You stage houses?

397
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:17,388
Yeah.

398
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:20,658
When people want to sell their house
but they moved out and it's empty,

399
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:22,159
I-I dress it.

400
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,864
I-I make it seem lived-in so people
can imagine themselves living there.

401
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,532
Oh.

402
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,579

403
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:36,974

404
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:37,975
Uh, yeah.

405
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,277
Okay.

00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,911

can stop now if you want.

Oh, please.

418
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,636
I'll see you, um, Thursday.

419
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,545
Great.

420
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,639

00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,216
um, how you're doing.

426

Anyway, um, we just
hadn't talked in a while,

427
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,389
and I wanted to tell
you I missed you,

Found this lovely gourmet shop around the

Roger, I invited you.

I had just lying around.

the complete set...

shellfish butter knives.

No.

you know, chucked it,

01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:02,710
I mean, sometimes it's nice
just being "in like," you know?

1279
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:05,179
Why didn't you and Mom
ever get together?

1280
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:07,148
(CHUCKLES) Oh.

1281
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:09,550
No, we're better off as friends.

1282
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:11,719
I give "great friend."

1283
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:12,887
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1284
01:23:12,888 --> 01:23:14,121
Mom, do you remember that time

1285
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:16,290
that we went up to, um, Big Bear,

1286
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:18,493
and Dad made a Venus
de Milo out of snow?

1288
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:22,597
I just remember you couldn't
keep your hands off her breasts.

1289
01:23:22,598 --> 01:23:24,332
They were shiny.

I could totally go for a white
Christmas again next year.

1292
01:23:27,803 --> 01:23:29,770
- Yeah?
- You want to?

1293
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:32,373
I would love that.

1294
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:41,751
Hey, is this that guy?

1295
01:23:42,818 --> 01:23:43,951
Who?

1296
01:23:43,952 --> 01:23:48,728
You know, the guy
that looks like Dad?

1297

01:23:52,461 --> 01:23:55,871
Invitation to an art gallery, or...

1301

Hi.

Um, how did you recognize me?

1310
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:47,782
Come with me.

1311
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:56,624
These are all new, just in
the last year... since you.

1312
01:24:56,625 --> 01:24:58,636
All of these?

1313
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:03,731
Anne, what... what happened?

1314
01:25:03,732 --> 01:25:07,468
Oh, well, he'd been sick
for a long time, you know.

1315
01:25:07,469 --> 01:25:09,878
He never told me.

1316
01:25:10,372 --> 01:25:12,849
He didn't want you to know.
