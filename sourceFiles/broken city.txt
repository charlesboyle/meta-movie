- What do we want?!
- Justice!

00:02:36,337 --> 00:02:37,929
- When do we want it?
- Now!

5
00:02:38,072 --> 00:02:39,633
- What do we want?!
- Justice!

00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:41,333

7
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:42,756

00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:44,278
- When do we want it?
- Now!

9
00:02:55,657 --> 00:02:57,682
<i>- Your Honour, it's murder,</i>

10
00:02:57,826 --> 00:02:59,691
even when the police do it.

11
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:03,696
Detective William James Taggart swore an oath
to protect and serve

12
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:05,459
the people of New York.

13
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:07,824
He shattered that oath.

14
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:11,266
The state will prove
that there is probable cause

15
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:14,204
to try him for the murder of Mikey Tavarez.

16
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:15,900
Thank you, Your Honour.

17
00:03:16,044 --> 00:03:18,137
- Mr. Davies.
- Your Honour,

18
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:20,873
it isn't murder
when the other guy is shooting at you.

19
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:24,678
It isn't murder when the other guy has a gun.

20
00:03:28,356 --> 00:03:30,483
Five three, one-twenty.

21
00:03:42,704 --> 00:03:44,934
- What are we drinking, Chief?
- Nothing for me, sir.

22
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:47,871
- Huh. Civilization going to pieces.

23
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,445
Ah...

24
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:57,574
Oh! You know, there are...
a lot of men in this town

25
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:00,882
who would find it hard to trust
a man as respectable as you.

26
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:02,954
I am not one of those men.

27
00:04:03,091 --> 00:04:06,754
Your boss, the police commissioner,
he's an asshole.

28
00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:09,329
- I came to discuss the Taggart case, sir.

29
00:04:09,898 --> 00:04:13,595
- What is there to discuss?
It won't even make it past preliminary.

30
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:15,430
- Well, maybe we should hope it does, sir.

31
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,835
Those 10,000 people on the courthouse steps
are gonna find it very hard to believe

32
00:04:18,973 --> 00:04:20,463
that this wasn't murder, plain and simple.

33
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:22,371
- How's this for plain and simple?

34
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,978
There's one less homicidal rapist
walking the streets.

35
00:04:25,113 --> 00:04:27,707
- Uh, Mikey Tavarez was found innocent
of those charges, sir.

36
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:29,214
- He walked on a technicality.

37
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,114
You and I both know
he raped and killed Yesenia Barea.

38
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:34,084
- The law says differently, sir.

39
00:04:34,923 --> 00:04:36,914
- You always this much fun, Chief?

40
00:04:37,926 --> 00:04:39,791
I think Billy Taggart is a hero.

41
00:04:39,928 --> 00:04:42,761
And I like getting my photograph taken
next to heroes.

42
00:04:43,364 --> 00:04:46,458
I also like winning Staten Island
without actually having to go there.

43
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:49,069
- A witness came forward this morning, sir.

44
00:04:49,938 --> 00:04:52,498
- We are two minutes away
from the judge's decision.

45
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,767
- He came forward with evidence.

46
00:04:55,777 --> 00:04:56,903
- Where is it?

47
00:04:57,045 --> 00:04:59,309
- It's been temporarily misplaced.

48
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:00,778
- The witness?

49
00:05:01,382 --> 00:05:02,576
- A kid.

50
00:05:06,788 --> 00:05:08,085
- Is he legal?

51
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,156
Is his mother legal?

52
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:12,919
We need to find out what he wants.

53
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:15,325
- Appears he wants justice, sir.

54
00:05:15,463 --> 00:05:17,761
- Well, nobody gets that.

55
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:20,066
What do you want, Chief?

56
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,604
- I want what's best for the city, sir.

57
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:29,205
<i>- It is the court's view...</i>

58
00:05:29,344 --> 00:05:31,835
that the state has failed...

59
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,709
...to present a clear case

60
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:38,683
for why the shooting should amount to murder
and not self-defence.

61
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:44,053
Therefore the defendant will not be held
to answer to these charges at trial.

62
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:46,683
He's free to go. Court adjourned.

63
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:53,861
- Detective.

64
00:05:54,002 --> 00:05:56,994
Sorry to interrupt.
Chief Fairbanks want to see you.

65
00:06:00,842 --> 00:06:02,469
- Here's our guy.

66
00:06:03,011 --> 00:06:04,706
How are you?
- Mr. Mayor.

67
00:06:04,846 --> 00:06:06,279
- Billy.
- Hey, Chief.

68
00:06:06,414 --> 00:06:07,881
- Sit down, Detective.

69
00:06:08,216 --> 00:06:10,207
- What's this about?

70
00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:12,080
- Sit down.
- Don't worry about the Chief.

71
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,053
We draw straws for "good cop, bad cop"
and he won.

72
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:17,157
- What, does he wanna interrogate me now?
- No.

73
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,021
No, no.
I just wanted to get in a room with you.

74
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:23,725
And I wanted to tell
you how proud I am of you.

75
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:25,662
You've done the city a great favour.

76
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,394
You, in my eyes: hero.

77
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:30,731
- Thank you.
- Here's the thing.

78
00:06:30,872 --> 00:06:33,102
Some uncomfortable evidence
has come to light.

79
00:06:33,241 --> 00:06:35,004
If it should come out...

80
00:06:35,676 --> 00:06:37,234
...we will be fucked.

81
00:06:37,378 --> 00:06:38,936
And it is a necessity

82
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,048
that we remain un-fucked.

83
00:06:41,883 --> 00:06:42,850
So...

84
00:06:42,984 --> 00:06:44,349
- You're done, Detective.

85
00:06:45,253 --> 00:06:47,585
- Yesenia Barea was 16 years old, Chief.

86
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:49,917
- Mikey Tavarez was exonerated.
- Yeah, and they got it wrong.

87
00:06:50,058 --> 00:06:53,255
- So you put it right.
- No, I'm not the bad guy, Chief.

88
00:06:53,394 --> 00:06:54,952
Mr. Mayor...
- You keep telling yourself that.

89
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:56,961
- You see, Billy,
there's some wars you fight,

90
00:06:57,098 --> 00:06:58,759
and some wars you walk away from.

91
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,869
- Mayor...
- This is not the fighting kind.

92
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:03,698
I have a long memory, son.

93
00:07:04,605 --> 00:07:06,505
If you ever change your number...

94
00:07:07,275 --> 00:07:09,903
...you make sure you let my office know.

95
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,715
<i>Mayor Nicholas Hostetler
is Wall Street's approved candidate.</i>

96
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:52,115
<i>At least that's the charge
coming from the Mayor's rival,</i>

97
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:55,313
<i>Councilman Jack Valliant,
who spoke to reporters earlier today.</i>

98
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:04,925
- Hey! What the fuck you doin'?!
- Hey, what...?! Ah!

99
00:09:08,396 --> 00:09:11,695
- Hey, what the fuck's going on out here?!
- I don't... Take it easy.

100
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:14,164
- What's going on?
- This guy tried to attack me.

101
00:09:16,204 --> 00:09:17,637
Motherfucker!

102
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:21,636
No, stop!

103
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:23,601
No! Please! No.

104
00:09:23,744 --> 00:09:25,712
- Fucker.

105
00:09:25,846 --> 00:09:27,404
Where's my camera?

106
00:09:28,216 --> 00:09:30,776
Sweetheart, look at me for a second, please?

107
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:32,351
Thank you.

108
00:09:34,222 --> 00:09:35,655
Sonofabitch.

109
00:09:40,061 --> 00:09:42,586
"Just like in the beginning,

110
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,857
when no one would admit
something was happening."

111
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:47,697
"Never... happened, never...

112
00:09:47,835 --> 00:09:49,234
happened."

113
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,737
Big part, too disturbing...

114
00:09:52,873 --> 00:09:54,238
Something...

115
00:09:56,077 --> 00:09:58,238
<i>Ay dios, Billy. Otra vez?</i>

116
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:02,114
- Alright, alright.

117
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,117
- When are you gonna stop doing this, Billy?
- Stop what?

118
00:10:05,253 --> 00:10:07,881
- Coming home
looking like a pack of bloody meat.

119
00:10:08,022 --> 00:10:10,456
- I thought you liked bloody meat.
- I'm a vegetarian.

120
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:13,116
- Yeah, well,
you gotta get your protein somehow, right?

121
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:14,990
- You're an asshole.

122
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:16,391
- Ow.

123
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,124
So did you pick up your dress
for the premiere?

124
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:21,701
- Tomorrow.
- Am I gonna like this dress?

125
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,965
- I think you'll approve.

126
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:25,504
- Will Ryan like this dress?

127
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,235
- I dunno. I'm not familiar with his tastes.
- Come on, I see the looks he gives you.

128
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:31,697
- How come you see these looks
and I don't see these looks?

129
00:10:31,812 --> 00:10:34,332
- Because you only see the best in people.
It's your fatal flaw.

130
00:10:34,382 --> 00:10:35,474
- And what's yours?

131
00:10:36,284 --> 00:10:38,809
- Not being able to see the best in people.

132
00:10:38,953 --> 00:10:40,352
- Not even me?

133
00:10:40,488 --> 00:10:42,479
- You're the exception, you know that.

134
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:45,152
- Well, I'm an actress.

135
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:47,784
Maybe I've got you fooled.

136
00:10:47,928 --> 00:10:49,520
- I'm a detective.

137
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:51,256
You couldn't if you tried.

138
00:10:58,806 --> 00:11:00,171
<i>It's down to the wire,</i>

139
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:02,572
<i>with New Yorkers
set to vote in just eight days.</i>

140
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,268
<i>Our latest poll

141
00:11:04,412 --> 00:11:07,142

142
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:09,681
<i>and look at what a potential
Valliant administration could...</i>

143
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:20,385
<i>No, Tom, no, not a few weeks.
Months.</i>

144

<i>Simon Cowell was still on American Idol</i>

145
00:11:23,698 --> 00:11:27,099
when we did this job for you.
Well, what do you mean, what do I want?

146
00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:29,634
What, am I speaking Latin here?
I want payment, Tom. Payment.

147
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,534
I want $5,500 dollars, is what...
Hello?

148
00:11:33,174 --> 00:11:34,300
Hello?

149
00:11:35,976 --> 00:11:37,534
Fucking crossdresser.

150
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:46,417
Hi. Gary Lyman's office, please?

151
00:11:46,554 --> 00:11:48,181
Yeah, I'll wait.

152
00:11:49,357 --> 00:11:52,053
- If that's your brother
calling collect again, Katy, I swear.

153
00:11:52,193 --> 00:11:54,718
<i>- It's called collections, Billy. Y'know,</i>

154
00:11:54,862 --> 00:11:56,782
because you don't like
to charge nobody up front.

155
00:11:56,797 --> 00:11:59,163
- How's it comin'?
- Uh, you know that theory of yours

156
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,234
about never being broke
if somebody owes you?

157
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:03,360
We're broke. Hee-hee.

158
00:12:03,804 --> 00:12:05,567
Yeah, no, I'm still holding.

159
00:12:06,574 --> 00:12:07,563
Yeah.

160
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:11,576
- What is this?

161
00:12:11,712 --> 00:12:14,579
- Some guy from Staten Island
said he's gonna find you and kill you.

162
00:12:14,715 --> 00:12:17,081
- Call him back.
Tell him he owes me a camera.

163
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:19,812
- Oh. Oh, he just stepped out?

164
00:12:21,021 --> 00:12:22,386
Oh, yeah, just now?

165
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:28,153
Okay, well... you tell him he's got
till the close of business today

166
00:12:28,295 --> 00:12:30,820
to call Katy from Billy Taggart's office.

167
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:34,500
Or else I'm gonna tell his wife
he's been screwing his assistant

168
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:36,603
for the past 11 months, how about that?!

169
00:12:37,238 --> 00:12:40,696
- Are you serious?
- Look, these people provoke me, Billy.

170
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:42,638
All day. You don't even know.

171
00:12:42,777 --> 00:12:46,269
- This is a professional workplace, Katy.
- Yeah. Once more with conviction.

172
00:12:46,414 --> 00:12:48,712
- How much have you cleared?
- Uh...

173
00:12:48,849 --> 00:12:51,113
like... $1,800?

174
00:12:51,252 --> 00:12:53,447
- Well, that's not bad.
How much is still outstanding?

175
00:12:53,587 --> 00:12:55,885
- Forty-two thousand.

176
00:12:57,057 --> 00:12:58,854
- Gimme the fuckin' numbers.
- Yeah.

177
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,058
- How about I fuckin' garnish your wages,
put a lien on your garage

178
00:13:02,196 --> 00:13:04,756
until I've gotten every cent
of the eight grand you owe me?

179
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:07,459
<i>Does that work for you?
- How about I pay you in instalments?</i>

180
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:10,601
- Yeah, three instalments of 2,650.
First payment this Friday. Talk to Katy.

181
00:13:10,638 --> 00:13:12,333
<i>Jimmy. Hey, buddy.
It's Billy.</i>

182
00:13:12,473 --> 00:13:15,306
<i>- What's up, Bill?
- Oh, just checkin' on you.</i>

183
00:13:15,443 --> 00:13:18,003
<i>Hoping I can get that payment, buddy.
- Aw, well, y'know,</i>

184
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:20,204
<i>things have been a little slow here, y'know.</i>

185
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:22,747
<i>I've been, uh...
really going through some rough times.</i>

186
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:26,785
<i>How many times did you catch him,
literally with his pants down,</i>

187
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:31,722
<i>and I'm supposed to pay for his infidelity?!
- Well, you're the one that hired me, Amber.</i>

188
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:35,454
<i>That's the way this works.
- I'm supposed to foot the goddamn bill?!</i>

189
00:13:35,596 --> 00:13:37,757
<i>How many times, Billy? Tell me that!</i>

190
00:13:37,898 --> 00:13:40,958
- Eight times, Amber,
for a total billing of $4,000. C'mon!

191
00:13:41,101 --> 00:13:43,763
<i>- Send him the invoice, then!</i>

192
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:46,839
<i>Listen, Billy,
I'm not paying you a fuckin' dime.</i>

193
00:13:46,974 --> 00:13:48,942
- I want my fuckin' money!

194
00:13:49,076 --> 00:13:51,374
<i>- Yeah, you'll get it. Neveruary.</i>

195
00:13:51,512 --> 00:13:53,036
- What kind of man are you, Dave?

196
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,910
Because I tell you, Dave,
a man that doesn't pay his debts

197
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:59,679
is the worst kind of man there is.
Is that the kind of man you are?

198
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,186
<i>- Okay, okay.
I can maybe get you half by Monday.</i>

199
00:14:02,323 --> 00:14:05,315
- Alright, half is fair, I can do half.
Talk to Katy.

200
00:14:05,926 --> 00:14:07,484
- Hey, Dave. Katy.

201
00:14:08,128 --> 00:14:10,255
So what time Monday, huh?

202
00:14:10,397 --> 00:14:13,457
- I'm going to get some air.
- Okay.

203
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:20,731
Billy?!

204
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:21,933
Billy!

205
00:14:22,843 --> 00:14:25,209
Phone!
- Take a message!

206
00:14:25,346 --> 00:14:26,813
- It's the mayor.

207
00:14:35,523 --> 00:14:37,218
- You seem nervous.

208
00:14:37,358 --> 00:14:40,350
- Yeah, it's probably the bomb
I got shoved up my asshole.

209
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,324
<i>Too soon?
- Councilman Valliant,</i>

210
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:49,459
any comment on the Bolton Village sale?
- I think this is a sad day for New York.

211
00:14:49,603 --> 00:14:52,629
I never thought I'd see a mayor of this city,
even this mayor,

212
00:14:52,773 --> 00:14:56,265
stoop so low as to steal the homes
of 30,000 hard-working New Yorkers.

213
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,208
And I guarantee you
that I will not let this sale stand

214
00:14:59,346 --> 00:15:00,904
when I'm elected mayor on Tuesday.

215
00:15:01,048 --> 00:15:03,689
<i>- Do you think the timing
of the mayor's announcement is political?</i>

216
00:15:03,784 --> 00:15:04,944
<i>- Absolutely. I know it's political.</i>

217
00:15:05,085 --> 00:15:07,451
<i>And that's not to say
that Nick Hostetler doesn't care,</i>

218
00:15:07,588 --> 00:15:09,789
<i>because evidently he cares very deeply
about two things:</i>

219
00:15:09,857 --> 00:15:12,690
<i>His own job and taking care of his buddies
on Wall Street.</i>

220
00:15:12,826 --> 00:15:15,852
<i>- Do you have a message to the people
of Bolton Village, Councilman?</i>

221
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:17,623
<i>- Yes, I do. Help is on the way.</i>

222
00:15:17,765 --> 00:15:20,165
<i>Come Tuesday,
you will have an ally in City Hall.</i>

223
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:22,929
<i>Vote your interests next week,
and we'll take this city back.</i>

224
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,594
- Can't even get his numbers right.

225
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:29,266
Bolton Village is home to 37,512.
And you know what this deal means for them?

226
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,641
- Valliant seems to think
it means inevitable eviction, Mayor.

227
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,407
- Valliant thinks.

228
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,518
What it means is better service,
more attentive landlords,

229
00:15:38,652 --> 00:15:41,644
somebody actually showing up
when the toilet is blocked

230
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:43,450
or the heat's on the fritz.

231
00:15:43,591 --> 00:15:46,389
It means paint on the walls
and it means the windows fixed.

232
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:48,654
- Valliant says Solstein Donagan's
gonna jack up their rents,

233
00:15:48,796 --> 00:15:50,593
replace 'em with yuppies.

234
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:54,529
- This is a great deal
for the people of Bolton Village,

235
00:15:54,668 --> 00:15:57,466
and it's a great deal
for the city of New York.

236
00:15:57,605 --> 00:16:02,633
- Do you think the announcement of this deal
will, uh, add to your poll numbers, sir?

237
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:04,641
- Well, you know, Mike,

238
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:08,680
<i>if the readers of the New York Post
want to reward competence,</i>

239
00:16:08,816 --> 00:16:11,478
who am I to argue with that?
Excuse me.

240
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:12,813
Yeah.

241
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:16,818
Well, obviously,
that was some attempt at humour.

242
00:16:17,825 --> 00:16:21,124
No, call off the brigade. Bring him up.
Thank you.

243
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:24,059
Alright, Mike, get outta here.

244
00:16:24,632 --> 00:16:27,123
Go and do the people's work.
- Good luck Tuesday, Mayor.

245
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:28,700
- Hey, hey, thank you.

246
00:16:28,836 --> 00:16:31,168
Look - ahem - here's one for the car.
One for the wife.

247
00:16:31,305 --> 00:16:33,933
And that one for the kid.
Put it on his school bag.

248
00:16:34,074 --> 00:16:35,701
- Thanks, Mayor.
- Alright.

249
00:16:35,843 --> 00:16:37,504
- Mr. Mayor.

250
00:16:37,645 --> 00:16:38,839
- Hey.

251
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,474
You know, Billy, we take threats
of terrorism very seriously around here.

252
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:48,350
- Right.
- Even from good Catholic boys like you.

253
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:53,722
I'm only kidding.
Look at you, lookin' all civilized.

254
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:55,522
- It's good to see you, Mayor.

255
00:16:55,663 --> 00:16:57,722
- See this golden boy on your way in?

256
00:16:57,865 --> 00:16:59,730
- Yeah, I caught a glimpse.

257
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:01,994
- Y'know, if I'm being honest,

258
00:17:02,136 --> 00:17:04,730
ah... I find it faintly insulting.

259
00:17:04,872 --> 00:17:08,501
- What's that, the fact that you're running
dead even with a nobody?

260
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,835
- Yeah.
You were always were more balls than tact.

261
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:17,508
- Hey, I don't know what came over me, Mayor.
I'm actually trying to reverse the trend.

262
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:20,313
- No, you shouldn't.
It's one of your strong suits.

263
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:23,982
Scotch?
- Uh, I'm on the wagon, thank you.

264
00:17:24,124 --> 00:17:25,557
- Really?

265
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:28,218
What about if I just, uh, pour one for you...

266
00:17:28,362 --> 00:17:31,126
and I'm gonna leave it between us
like a symbol, y'know?

267
00:17:31,265 --> 00:17:34,132
- You gonna be able to put this guy away,
you think?

268
00:17:35,536 --> 00:17:39,097
- I ever tell you about Johnny Ingrisano?
- I don't think you told me that one, Mayor.

269
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:42,208
- Every day, growing up in Queens,
this guy would pummel me at recess.

270
00:17:42,342 --> 00:17:43,536
Every day.

271
00:17:44,344 --> 00:17:46,539
What could I do? I was just a kid.

272
00:17:47,715 --> 00:17:51,082
A couple of years ago,
I heard Ingrisano got in some legal trouble.

273
00:17:51,218 --> 00:17:54,415
The kind of trouble another guy
could get himself out of easily.

274
00:17:54,555 --> 00:17:56,113
So I got involved.

275
00:17:56,256 --> 00:17:59,225
Now, he scratches his ass
without permission,

276
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,156
he spends a week in Rikers.

277
00:18:02,563 --> 00:18:05,555
Jack Valliant reminds me
a lot of Johnny Ingrisano.

278
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:08,796
You ever do any hunting?
- Naw.

279
00:18:08,936 --> 00:18:11,928
- You should try it.
You would be a natural.

280
00:18:12,172 --> 00:18:13,730
And you'd love the dogs.

281
00:18:14,174 --> 00:18:17,541
Y'know, women call men dogs.
They mean it to suggest

282
00:18:17,678 --> 00:18:20,613
we're... somehow untrustworthy or disloyal.

283
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:22,739
But a dog is anything but.

284
00:18:24,585 --> 00:18:26,246
And if men are dogs,

285
00:18:26,386 --> 00:18:28,752
what the goddamn hell
does that make women?

286
00:18:28,956 --> 00:18:31,254
You ever seen a bitch in heat, Billy?

287
00:18:31,391 --> 00:18:34,952
She'll grind herself across the grass
to try and get at that itch.

288
00:18:36,764 --> 00:18:40,200
And if she can find a way to sneak out
of the backyard, any dog'll do.

289
00:18:41,201 --> 00:18:43,601
- I'm not sure I'm following you, Mayor.

290
00:18:46,774 --> 00:18:50,403
- I need you to help me find the sonofabitch
who's fucking my wife.

291
00:18:52,312 --> 00:18:53,973
- You think she's having an affair?

292
00:18:54,114 --> 00:18:56,154
- I know she's having an affair.

293
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,275
<i>- Maybe you should call
the Post and confirm.</i>

294
00:18:58,418 --> 00:18:59,783
- She's smarter than that.

295
00:19:00,621 --> 00:19:01,986
So is he.

296
00:19:03,423 --> 00:19:04,981
He's like a goddamn phantom.

297
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,320
- Maybe he doesn't exist.

298
00:19:07,461 --> 00:19:09,224
- I still want the pictures.

299
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:11,492
I wanna know who he is,

300
00:19:11,632 --> 00:19:13,099
I wanna know where he's from,

301
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:15,724
I wanna know how big his dick is,
how long he lasts.

302
00:19:15,869 --> 00:19:17,928
Where do they fuck,
in hotels or at his place?

303
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:21,507
I wanna know if he makes her come,
or if she fakes it with him, too.

304
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:23,872
And I wanna know everything
by election day.

305
00:19:24,011 --> 00:19:26,673
- Why? What's it got to do with the election?

306
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:28,805
- New Yorkers, they've elected drunks,

307
00:19:28,949 --> 00:19:32,680
crooks, Italians, homos,
Jews and blacks to that seat,

308
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,152
but they will not elect is some guy

309
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:38,258
whose wife is fucking some other guy
behind his back.

310
00:19:38,826 --> 00:19:41,124
Now this... pussy, this Jack Valliant,

311
00:19:41,261 --> 00:19:43,593
he may be too much of a lightweight

312
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,699
to use this story
if it comes across his desk.

313
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:48,825
But his staff will not hesitate.

314
00:19:49,837 --> 00:19:52,397
- What if she doesn't see him
before next Tuesday?

315
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:55,838
- Then it's gonna be the easiest $50,000
you ever made.

316
00:19:56,677 --> 00:19:58,474
Half now, half later.

317
00:19:58,846 --> 00:20:01,679
- Half right now?
- Right this instant.

318
00:20:02,282 --> 00:20:05,183
What do you say?
- I say yes.

319
00:20:05,686 --> 00:20:08,678
- You get me what I need.
- I will, Mayor.

320
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:10,517
You consider it done.

321
00:20:12,693 --> 00:20:15,355
- You can get my wife's schedule
from Valerie on the way out.

322
00:20:15,495 --> 00:20:16,826
- Mm-hmm.

323
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:20,723
- Something wrong?

324
00:20:20,868 --> 00:20:23,564
- When you called, I didn't think
it'd be for something like this.

325
00:20:23,704 --> 00:20:24,830
- Yeah.

326
00:20:26,707 --> 00:20:28,072
Neither did I.

327
00:20:32,512 --> 00:20:34,070
Hey, Billy.

328
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:36,345
Welcome back.

329
00:20:37,517 --> 00:20:38,882
- Thanks, Mayor.

330
00:20:49,763 --> 00:20:52,596
<i>The local New York news time
is 7:52.</i>

331
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:54,724
<i>Public housing goes private...</i>

332
00:20:58,538 --> 00:21:00,529
- You got time for breakfast?

333
00:21:01,108 --> 00:21:03,201
- Baby, have you seen my keys?

334
00:21:03,343 --> 00:21:05,868
- On the table, by your hot-sauce collection.

335
00:21:08,749 --> 00:21:12,617
So it looks like we can do L.A. in style.
I landed a pretty big contract yesterday.

336
00:21:12,753 --> 00:21:14,812
I got some cushion now.
- Yeah? That sounds great.

337
00:21:14,955 --> 00:21:17,788
I'm gonna text you all the details
for the cast dinner tomorrow.

338
00:21:17,925 --> 00:21:20,587
Okay?
- No. No, no, no. I'm not going to that.

339
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:23,161
Those guys take that metrosexual shit
way too far.

340
00:21:23,297 --> 00:21:26,391
I don't give a fuck you wanna be
a thespian or a lesbian. That's fine.

341
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:29,798
But when a grown man starts whipping out
a compact and a powder-puff for dinner,

342
00:21:29,937 --> 00:21:32,428
that's no good.
- Can you pretend to be interested?

343
00:21:32,572 --> 00:21:34,164
Just one night, baby, please?

344
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:38,244
It's not every day that your girlfriend
stars in her first indie film.

345
00:21:38,378 --> 00:21:41,506
- If you ask me nicely.
- Can you, please?

346
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:42,774
- Yes.

347
00:21:45,152 --> 00:21:48,019
Maybe put a little powder on me,
so I don't feel so left out.

348
00:21:48,155 --> 00:21:49,645
- No.
- Okay.

349
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,588
But I feel uncomfortable around those people.

350
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:22,620
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the First Lady
of New York City, Cathleen Hostetler.</i>

351
00:22:28,161 --> 00:22:30,425
- We did it!

352
00:22:31,832 --> 00:22:34,960
Equality has finally come to New York.

353
00:22:37,004 --> 00:22:40,633
<i>Some said that now wasn't the right time
to wage this fight.</i>

354
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:44,700
<i>Well, I say there's never a wrong time
to fight for what is rightfully yours.</i>

355
00:22:49,383 --> 00:22:52,648
I say there is never a wrong time to stand up

356
00:22:52,786 --> 00:22:54,981
to the bullies.

357
00:22:55,122 --> 00:22:57,056
<i>Even if they’re powerful bullies.</i>

358
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,887
<i>Especially if they’re powerful bullies.</i>

359
00:23:01,028 --> 00:23:04,486
<i>That just makes the victory so much sweeter.</i>

360
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:06,030
<i>Yes, ma'am!</i>

361
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:09,230
<i>- And today we declare a victory.</i>

362
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:14,906
<i>Today we declare,
with our hearts full and our heads high:</i>

363
00:23:15,042 --> 00:23:17,408
<i>"This is my life</i>

364
00:23:17,544 --> 00:23:20,843
<i>and I will love whom I damn well choose."</i>

365
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:22,846
Thank you.

366
00:23:53,246 --> 00:23:55,714
- Come on, buddy, show me your face.

367
00:23:56,516 --> 00:23:58,279
Shit.

368
00:24:15,936 --> 00:24:17,233
Damn.

369
00:24:27,747 --> 00:24:31,114
<i>- You read the Times this morning?
- No, I did not.</i>

370
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:34,947
<i>I read the Post, like the rest of New York</i>

371
00:24:36,123 --> 00:24:37,750
- Interesting editorial.

372
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:41,618
- That rag is a glorified tabloid
for rich people.

373
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:43,558
- You're rich, aren't you, Nick?

374
00:24:44,131 --> 00:24:45,564
Filthy rich...

375
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:48,761
...if recent events are any indication.

376
00:24:50,337 --> 00:24:53,829
- Y'know, I heard your speech went down
like gangbusters last night.

377
00:24:53,974 --> 00:24:55,999
- Mm.
- Like the opening night of "Mamma Mia,"

378
00:24:56,143 --> 00:24:58,202
they say.
Queens doing back flips in the aisles.

379
00:24:58,345 --> 00:25:00,575
- Mm. Somebody you know attend?

380
00:25:02,782 --> 00:25:05,842
- You know who's really excited
about this new law?

381
00:25:05,986 --> 00:25:07,977
- Who?
- Artie.

382
00:25:09,156 --> 00:25:12,592
He says he's never written
so many prenups in his life.

383
00:25:13,593 --> 00:25:15,220
You remember Artie?

384
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:17,159
- I think of him every day.

385
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,604
- You didn't mention the election last night.

386
00:25:26,173 --> 00:25:28,004
- It was not the proper forum.

387
00:25:30,377 --> 00:25:31,605
- Darlin'...

388
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,478
...it's election season.

389
00:25:35,615 --> 00:25:37,378
Every forum's the proper forum.

390
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,385
Act accordingly.

391
00:25:44,624 --> 00:25:46,182
Bo!

392
00:25:47,394 --> 00:25:49,055
C'mere.

393
00:25:49,196 --> 00:25:51,187
<i>- Smile.</i>

394
00:25:52,632 --> 00:25:54,190
A little to the left.

395
00:26:00,207 --> 00:26:02,175
- This is what you do all day?

396
00:26:03,043 --> 00:26:05,273
Spy on beautiful women in swanky restaurants?

397
00:26:05,412 --> 00:26:08,643
- Yeah, if you consider the finer bodegas
of Bensonhurst swanky.

398
00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:12,709
- We should do this more often.
- Figured it was time you earned your keep.

399
00:26:12,852 --> 00:26:17,016
- Does that mean I get paid this month?
- Yep. Soon as I see that phone bill.

400
00:26:17,157 --> 00:26:18,954
- He's my brother. What do you want?

401
00:26:19,092 --> 00:26:20,582
- Send him a phone card.

402
00:26:20,727 --> 00:26:23,059
- Yeah, I should, right?

403
00:26:25,665 --> 00:26:27,360
- He doin' alright?

404
00:26:28,668 --> 00:26:32,661
- Y'know... Sing Sing ain't no place
for guys with good hearts.

405
00:26:37,444 --> 00:26:39,605
Why'd the mayor call you, Billy?

406
00:26:39,746 --> 00:26:41,304
- Ah, she's grabbing her things.

407
00:26:41,448 --> 00:26:43,780
- Shit. What do I do?
- Calm down. Look at me.

408
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:46,613
Smile. Thatta girl.
Stand up, get your coat.

409
00:26:46,753 --> 00:26:49,551
Just keep smiling and talking, okay?
- My heart is pounding, Billy.

410
00:26:49,689 --> 00:26:50,883
- Purse.

411
00:26:52,092 --> 00:26:54,117
C'mere. Beat her to the door.

412
00:26:54,261 --> 00:26:57,355
Then get across the street so you can cover
whichever direction she goes.

413
00:26:57,497 --> 00:26:59,226
Call me when you got her.
- Okay.

414
00:26:59,466 --> 00:27:02,663
<i>- Alright, you're my eyes. What do we have?
- Uptown on Madison,</i>

415
00:27:02,802 --> 00:27:05,202
towards 45th. She dumped the friend,
picked up her bodyguard.

416
00:27:05,272 --> 00:27:08,072
<i>- Alright, keep at her pace.
No more than two bodies between you, okay?</i>

417
00:27:08,108 --> 00:27:11,305
- She's on the phone. She just took a call.
- Blackberry?

418
00:27:11,444 --> 00:27:14,311
<i>- It's a flip phone.
- Alright, I need you to get in closer, okay?</i>

419
00:27:14,447 --> 00:27:17,075
<i>Get me a name, Katy.
A place, a time, something, anything.</i>

420
00:27:17,217 --> 00:27:19,845
- Okay.
- No, no, no, I...

421
00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:22,784
I understand.
So, uh, what time, darling?

422
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:26,357
I'll be there.
- It's him, Billy. She's arranging a meeting.

423
00:27:26,493 --> 00:27:28,154
<i>- Alright, I got her.</i>

424
00:27:28,295 --> 00:27:29,592
Yeah.

425
00:27:29,729 --> 00:27:31,424
I'll be there soon.

426
00:27:36,236 --> 00:27:38,500
Alright, go.
- Ma'am?

427
00:27:38,638 --> 00:27:42,301
Ma'am! Sorry, it's-i-i-it's yours.
I think you dropped this.

428
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,505
- Yes, thank you.
- Ah, you're welcome.

429
00:27:48,748 --> 00:27:50,943
Looks like she's going to the Roosevelt.
Should we follow her?

430
00:27:51,084 --> 00:27:53,204
- No, she's gonna figure out
we were here soon enough.

431
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,550
We need to find out
who this number belongs to.

432
00:27:55,689 --> 00:27:57,748
If he drives a Lexus, we got our guy.

433
00:27:58,158 --> 00:28:00,183
- Welcome back to the Roosevelt,
Mrs. Hostetler.

434
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:01,954
- Thank you, Kenny.

435
00:28:04,331 --> 00:28:06,561
<i>- I got him.
- You got him?</i>

436
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,601
- Oh, I got him. And it's good, Billy.

437
00:28:09,736 --> 00:28:11,533
- How good?
- Ugh... wondrous good.

438
00:28:11,671 --> 00:28:14,697
- Wondrous?
What, they teach you that at DeVry?

439
00:28:14,841 --> 00:28:16,468
- I go to Hunter, asshole.
- Oh!

440
00:28:16,609 --> 00:28:19,043
Pardon me!
- It's a sophisticated place, alright?

441
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:22,046
I got sophisticated friends.
We read books. We drink wine.

442
00:28:22,182 --> 00:28:24,047
- Really? Are you old enough to drink?

443
00:28:24,184 --> 00:28:27,210
- Be surprised what I'm old enough to do.
- Hey, easy, okay?

444
00:28:27,354 --> 00:28:30,346
- For example, I'm old enough to vote.

445
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:34,084
And it might come of some interest,
when casting my ballot,

446
00:28:34,227 --> 00:28:37,196
to know
that Jack Valliant's campaign manager,

447
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:41,664
a guy named Paul Andrews,
is fucking the mayor's wife.

448
00:28:41,801 --> 00:28:44,361
- Bullshit.
- And he drives a Lexus.

449
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:51,242
- This is good.

450
00:28:51,378 --> 00:28:53,175
- It's borderline orgasmic, Billy.

451
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,439
- Did you learn that at Hunter, too?

452
00:28:55,582 --> 00:28:57,243
- Wouldn't you like to know?

453
00:28:57,384 --> 00:28:59,875
- This is not gonna go over good
with the mayor.

454
00:29:00,587 --> 00:29:02,680
That is a cold bitch.

455
00:29:04,724 --> 00:29:06,919
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

456
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,461
<i>All luggage and parcels
must be attended at all times.</i>

457
00:29:10,597 --> 00:29:12,838
<i>Any items left unattended...
- Montauk. Round trip. Peak.</i>

458
00:29:12,866 --> 00:29:14,527
<i>-... will be removed by and subject</i>

459
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:17,465
<i>to search by the M.T.A. Police.
- Thank you.</i>

460
00:29:17,604 --> 00:29:19,401
<i>- Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

461
00:30:02,382 --> 00:30:03,508
- Whoa!

462
00:30:06,085 --> 00:30:09,316
How you lookin' against the kid?
- The numbers are holding steady.

463
00:30:09,456 --> 00:30:11,481
- Steady?
- Yeah.

464
00:30:11,624 --> 00:30:15,025
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Steady is a prelude to a shift. Okay?

465
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:17,152
- In what direction?

466
00:30:17,297 --> 00:30:18,821
- The incumbent, Sam.

467
00:30:18,965 --> 00:30:21,092
Always to the incumbent.

468
00:30:21,234 --> 00:30:23,134
- Really?

469
00:30:31,511 --> 00:30:32,671
- Ah!

470
00:30:34,247 --> 00:30:35,305
- Ah-hah!

471
00:30:35,982 --> 00:30:37,210
A little slow, Nick.
- Yeah?

472
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:40,012
You just watch your ass,
I'll take care of mine.

473
00:30:40,153 --> 00:30:43,850
- Yeah, I'm beginning to wonder if you can.
- It's like Griffith and Paret... in '62.

474
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,015
Emile Griffith and Benny Paret,
you remember that?

475
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,185
- Yeah.
- So the kid is Paret, I'm Griffith.

476
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:50,819
- You mean you're the fag?

477
00:30:52,131 --> 00:30:54,691
- I am Griffith minus the fag angle.

478
00:30:54,834 --> 00:30:58,133
I'm holdin' back.
I'm making him think he's got it won.

479
00:30:58,938 --> 00:31:01,566
And then comes the twelfth round, Sam.
You remember that?

480
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:02,697
- Yeah.

481
00:31:05,445 --> 00:31:06,810
- The kill shot.

482
00:31:06,946 --> 00:31:08,538
- Fuck you.

483
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:10,148
So, Nick...

484
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:14,711
...I've got a half a million sunk
in your campaign...

485
00:31:16,155 --> 00:31:18,385
...and a lot more riding on the result.

486
00:31:18,525 --> 00:31:19,822
So...

487
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:22,951
why don't you just tell me
how you're gonna win this thing.

488
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:37,234
- We have dirt dropping on the news desks
of every paper and every network...

489
00:31:37,377 --> 00:31:39,174
across this city tonight.

490
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,543
- Will it stick?
- No, it won't stick, it's all bullshit.

491
00:31:44,183 --> 00:31:45,616
But it will smudge.

492
00:31:45,752 --> 00:31:47,617
And that'll get the undecideds
thinking again,

493
00:31:47,754 --> 00:31:50,746
and Sunday night at the debate,
I will put him away.

494
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:53,617
- Well, you better, Nick.

495
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,625
You just better.

496
00:32:06,005 --> 00:32:07,768
- You know who you're voting for?

497
00:32:09,776 --> 00:32:14,475
- Nah, don't think I'll make it to the polls.
I usually try to vote for president, but...

498
00:32:14,614 --> 00:32:17,412
- President doesn't determine
the quality of life in Brooklyn, no?

499
00:32:18,017 --> 00:32:20,076
- How'd you know I was from Brooklyn?

500
00:32:20,219 --> 00:32:22,380
- You just told me you were from Brooklyn.

501
00:32:22,522 --> 00:32:25,286
I'm in the business
of picking up on these things.

502
00:32:25,425 --> 00:32:27,290
- What are you, a private eye?

503
00:32:27,427 --> 00:32:29,452
- No. Private eye?

504
00:32:29,596 --> 00:32:31,791
Private eyes still exist?

505
00:32:33,032 --> 00:32:34,465
- So what do you do, then?

506
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:36,125
- I'm in politics.

507
00:32:36,269 --> 00:32:38,737
- So who do you recommend?
- Oh, I recommend the new guy.

508
00:32:38,871 --> 00:32:42,568
- Ah, come on, he's too clean.
New York's this big, messy place.

509
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:46,008
- Well, does it have to be?
- No, I mean, it could be better, of course,

510
00:32:46,145 --> 00:32:48,613
but it's been pretty good
the last few years under Hostetler.

511
00:32:50,249 --> 00:32:53,047
- So what do you do, then?
- I work sanitation.

512
00:32:55,054 --> 00:32:57,818
- You clean up pretty well for a garbage man.

513
00:32:58,458 --> 00:33:00,426
- I'm just doing it to impress a lady.

514
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,289
- Ah, it's always a lady.

515
00:33:04,263 --> 00:33:05,821
Local 831?

516
00:33:06,633 --> 00:33:08,624
- Yeah, 15 years.
- Fifteen years.

517
00:33:10,837 --> 00:33:12,464
You own a home?

518
00:33:13,272 --> 00:33:15,103
- In New York?
- Exactly.

519
00:33:15,241 --> 00:33:19,041
So why is it that you, a union man -
and I take it a native New Yorker -

520
00:33:19,178 --> 00:33:22,079
why is it that you don't own
your own home in the city?

521
00:33:22,215 --> 00:33:25,343
Yet every Bernie and Gordon who get off
this fuckin' train with an MBA

522
00:33:25,485 --> 00:33:27,350
and low to no scruples, they own one.

523
00:33:27,487 --> 00:33:30,149
They own one in the city
and one on the island.

524
00:33:30,289 --> 00:33:31,654
So where is yours?

525
00:33:32,925 --> 00:33:34,483
I'm just saying.

526
00:33:38,097 --> 00:33:40,691
- So you own a house out here?
- No...

527
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:42,357
No.

528
00:33:42,502 --> 00:33:46,199
No, don't get me wrong, I like the water
and the sand and the grass, but no.

529
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:49,638
The only thing better than getting outta
that damn city is going back to it.

530
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:54,412
Nah, just about everything and anyone
I love is in that city.

531
00:33:54,547 --> 00:33:56,538
<i>The next and final stop
will be Montauk.</i>

532
00:33:56,683 --> 00:33:59,049
<i>All passengers must depart the train
at Montauk.</i>

533
00:33:59,185 --> 00:34:01,710
<i>Please be sure to gather all...
- Nice talking to you.</i>

534
00:34:01,854 --> 00:34:03,515

<i>Taggart Agency.</i>

540
00:35:14,961 --> 00:35:17,682
<i>- Were you on the other line?
- No, I'm trying to save your business.</i>

541
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:20,460
- Y'know, I don't get to say this too often,
but you were right.

542
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,828
<i>- Really?</i>

543
00:35:21,968 --> 00:35:25,233
- The mayor's wife
is fucking the campaign manager.

544
00:35:25,371 --> 00:35:26,633
<i>- Told you.
- Call the mayor,</i>

545
00:35:26,773 --> 00:35:28,536
<i>tell him I got some pictures.
- Okay.</i>

546
00:35:28,674 --> 00:35:31,074
<i>- And stay off the fuckin' phone.
- I wasn't a...</i>

547
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:36,642
- Ryan, I wouldn't even be in this movie
if it wasn't for you.

548
00:35:36,783 --> 00:35:39,581
So thank you. That was really sweet.
- Mm.

549
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:42,313
This guy right here,
we got a real civilian here.

550
00:35:42,455 --> 00:35:45,015
C'mon, William, tell us.
Wh-what do you do, uh...

551
00:35:45,158 --> 00:35:48,992
- I-I don't do anything important.
I take pictures. It's... very boring.

552
00:35:49,128 --> 00:35:51,653
- Oh, shit.
You're not paparazzi, are you?

553
00:35:51,798 --> 00:35:53,322
- No.

554
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:56,924
I actually, uh...
mostly stick to real people, so...

555
00:35:57,069 --> 00:35:59,833
- Billy is a private investigator.
He used to be a cop.

556
00:35:59,972 --> 00:36:02,213
- Get outta here. You serious?
- Is that how you two met?

557
00:36:02,308 --> 00:36:05,106
You promised not to write her a ticket
if she goes out with you.

558
00:36:05,244 --> 00:36:07,269
- Yeah, something like that.

559
00:36:07,413 --> 00:36:09,847
- Well, details, details, tell us everything.
- Come on, Billy, details.

560
00:36:09,982 --> 00:36:12,507
How'd a guy like you end up
with a girl like Natalie?

561
00:36:12,652 --> 00:36:15,018
- A guy like me?
- Ah, I can't imagine

562
00:36:15,154 --> 00:36:17,645
you were too big on the theatre.
- This is you guys' party.

563
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,991
Let's talk about your movie.
I'd rather hear about that.

564
00:36:20,092 --> 00:36:22,356
- No. No one leaves this table
without singing the blues, Billy.

565
00:36:22,495 --> 00:36:25,692
Natalie, you gotta pick up the slack here.
How did you meet this charming guy?

566
00:36:25,832 --> 00:36:29,734
- Billy was a friend of the family.
- Ah, so you guys lived

567
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:32,497
in the same neighbourhood, or...?
- He worked by where I lived.

568
00:36:32,638 --> 00:36:34,868
- So you fell in love
with the neighbourhood policeman?

569
00:36:35,675 --> 00:36:36,972
C'mon.

570
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:40,670
- We were just a bunch of broke Puerto Ricans
that nobody gave a damn about.

571
00:36:40,813 --> 00:36:42,542
And Billy was good to us.
- Barrow?

572
00:36:42,682 --> 00:36:44,343
Is that Puerto Rican?

573
00:36:44,483 --> 00:36:45,916
- It's actually Barea.

574
00:36:46,052 --> 00:36:47,644
- Nat... Natalie Barea.

575
00:36:47,787 --> 00:36:50,688
- Natalia.
- That actually has nice little ring to it.

576
00:36:50,823 --> 00:36:52,484
- Yeah.
- Okay, you changed it

577
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:54,855
so you could play more Anglo?
- No.

578
00:36:55,862 --> 00:36:57,727
I changed it because...

579
00:36:57,864 --> 00:36:59,957
I was tired of going into auditions

580
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:03,091
and the first question
out of the casting director's mouth

581
00:37:03,236 --> 00:37:05,704
was if I was related to Yesenia Barea.

582
00:37:06,873 --> 00:37:08,272
- Who's that?

583
00:37:08,407 --> 00:37:11,069
- My sister.
- Is she famous or somethin'?

584
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:13,906
- Yeah. Her face was in all the papers
about seven years ago.

585
00:37:14,046 --> 00:37:16,606
- Nat. Please, don't...
- Beautiful 16-year-old girl

586
00:37:16,749 --> 00:37:20,014
found raped and beaten to death
in an abandoned apartment in Bolton Village.

587
00:37:26,525 --> 00:37:28,288
Billy was good to us.

588
00:37:28,427 --> 00:37:30,054
It was a really hard time and...

589
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,093
...he made it better.

590
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:44,608
<i>- Well, sure, that's because you like
to accuse anyone who doesn't agree</i>

591
00:37:44,744 --> 00:37:47,440
with letting the rich off scot-free
of engaging in class warfare

592
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,981
when in reality you know full well
what real class warfare is:

593
00:37:51,117 --> 00:37:53,278
stealing the homes of working people
in Bolton Village,

594
00:37:53,286 --> 00:37:56,119
and handing them over at a cut rate
to an investment bank.

595
00:37:56,255 --> 00:37:58,314
That, sir, is real class warfare.

596
00:37:58,457 --> 00:38:00,516
- Well, maybe where you grew up
in Connecticut,

597
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,287
$3 billion is considered cut-rate,

598
00:38:02,428 --> 00:38:03,793
but here in New York City,

599
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:07,297
$3 billion is considered a lot of money
that can solve a lot of problems.

600
00:38:07,433 --> 00:38:10,473
- All due respect, you don't solve problems
by bending over for billionaires.

601
00:38:10,603 --> 00:38:13,037
- Oh, I may bend over for billionaires,
but, you know what?

602
00:38:13,172 --> 00:38:14,969
You come from a long line of 'em.

603
00:38:15,107 --> 00:38:19,066
And, by the way, how are the renovations
coming on that $4 million townhouse of yours

604
00:38:19,211 --> 00:38:21,941
over in Brooklyn Heights?
- You want my house, too? Take it.

605
00:38:22,081 --> 00:38:25,050
I'm upside-down on my mortgage
like the rest of this city.

606
00:38:25,184 --> 00:38:27,812
Because the system has been rigged
by men like you.

607
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,823
- Fuck, that's good.
- Yeah?

608
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:35,826
- I like that. You make that stick,
you pull undecideds off the fence.

609
00:38:35,962 --> 00:38:38,157
- Okay.

610
00:38:38,297 --> 00:38:40,162
Alright. We need that moment. Paul.

611
00:38:40,299 --> 00:38:43,291
You know that, uh, "Senator,
you are no Jack Kennedy." That moment.

612
00:38:43,436 --> 00:38:45,336
And it's got to be Bolton Village-related.

613
00:38:45,471 --> 00:38:47,591
- I'm telling you, it's good.
You stick to the issues,

614
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,835
people will see the difference
between the two of you.

615
00:38:49,976 --> 00:38:51,176
- It's not clean enough, Paul.

616
00:38:51,243 --> 00:38:54,770
It's gotta be clean-cut.
He's got this clear line of attack on me.

617
00:38:54,914 --> 00:38:57,508
I'm the rich Connecticut carpetbagger.
What the hell is he?

618
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,619
- He's out of a job come Tuesday
if you stick to the fuckin' issues.

619
00:39:00,753 --> 00:39:02,380
- You're missing the point!
He's a crook!

620
00:39:02,521 --> 00:39:04,614
I need to be able to hammer that home

621
00:39:04,757 --> 00:39:07,624
when he taunts me and pokes at me
about my family money,

622
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,389
Harvard and all the rest of it.
I need to be able to lay his fat ass flat!

623
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:14,021
You, sir, are a crook and a liar!
And if he tries

624
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:18,034
to challenge me to prove it,
I pull out that glorious piece of paper

625
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:20,297
you said you'd provide
and I start reading out loud.

626
00:39:20,439 --> 00:39:22,964
- Let's take 10.
Can I talk to you for a minute?

627
00:39:23,442 --> 00:39:25,842
Alright, so what's your problem, Jack?

628
00:39:26,012 --> 00:39:28,310
- The Daily News is my problem, Paul.

629
00:39:28,447 --> 00:39:31,041
<i>The Post, the Times, they're all the same.
Pick one.</i>

630
00:39:31,183 --> 00:39:33,708
We got Hostetler backing up
a dump-truckload of shit on me

631
00:39:33,853 --> 00:39:36,879
and our campaign's coming up with piss-all
by the way of pushback.

632
00:39:37,023 --> 00:39:40,424
I thought that's what Montauk was all about.
What happened to that source of yours?

633
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:42,459
- I'm working on it.
- So that's why you disappeared

634
00:39:42,595 --> 00:39:44,290
for nine hours yesterday?
- He kept us waiting.

635
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:47,422
Kept us on the hook. I told you.
- You came back stinking of booze.

636
00:39:47,566 --> 00:39:50,262
- I had a fucking cocktail, sweetheart.
- So where is our pushback, then?

637
00:39:50,403 --> 00:39:54,100
- Our pushback are truth and facts, Jack.
That's how we play.

638
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,401
- Where are our headlines?
That's all I wanna know.

639
00:39:56,542 --> 00:39:58,783
- I'll tell you something.
We don't need headlines, Jack.

640
00:39:58,911 --> 00:40:00,752
We don't need headlines,
because we're winning.

641
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,010
Even their internal polling
has us up by three.

642
00:40:03,149 --> 00:40:05,014
You're winning on your own fucking terms.

643
00:40:05,151 --> 00:40:07,085
But let me tell you something,

644
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:11,622
you go onto that debate stage
and you try to win that debate

645
00:40:11,757 --> 00:40:15,557
by going negative blow to negative blow,
he'll fuckin' destroy you.

646
00:40:15,694 --> 00:40:17,127
Understand that.

647
00:40:17,263 --> 00:40:19,595
- Glad you got so much faith in me, Paul.

648
00:40:19,732 --> 00:40:22,064
- I'm all faith, you smug sonofabitch.

649
00:40:22,902 --> 00:40:25,598
Why don't you try having some?
- Just do me a favour.

650
00:40:25,738 --> 00:40:27,205
Just do your job.

651
00:40:29,408 --> 00:40:31,376
Just get me that file.

652
00:40:32,912 --> 00:40:34,539
- Yes, sir.

653
00:40:47,193 --> 00:40:50,629
- Hey, Murdock.
Save some for the rest of us, will you?

654
00:40:50,763 --> 00:40:52,958
- Mm, Billy, God, holy shit.

655
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:55,727
What are you doing here?
- I was in the neighbourhood.

656
00:40:55,935 --> 00:40:57,402
- Yeah, me, too.

657
00:40:57,536 --> 00:41:00,562
- You club a herd of penguins for that getup?
- This number? What can I say?

658
00:41:00,706 --> 00:41:03,174
Private sector's been good to me.
- Oh, you a shamus?

659
00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:04,799
- Nah, security.

660
00:41:04,944 --> 00:41:06,605
See that kid over there?

661
00:41:06,745 --> 00:41:08,406
That's T odd Lancaster. That's my charge.

662
00:41:08,547 --> 00:41:10,811
Rich kid.
Pop tears down buildings for a living,

663
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:13,248
wants him to run the business one day.

664
00:41:13,385 --> 00:41:15,910
I'm making sure he stays
on the straight and narrow till then.

665
00:41:16,055 --> 00:41:17,989
- How you doin', Mr. Mayor?
- Tony, how are you?

666
00:41:18,124 --> 00:41:20,115
Harris, come and say hello.

667
00:41:22,128 --> 00:41:24,596
This is Harris Sargent,
SVP at Solstein Donagan.

668
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:27,198
Helped me push through
the Bolton Village deal.

669
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:30,530
Four billion dollars
we beat out of this poor bastard.

670
00:41:30,669 --> 00:41:33,331
- Hi, Mr. Sargent. Good to see you.
You remember my son, Todd?

671
00:41:33,472 --> 00:41:35,235
- Todd.
- If you do, you get a prize.

672
00:41:35,374 --> 00:41:37,604
- Todd, when are you gonna
do the world a favour

673
00:41:37,743 --> 00:41:41,440
and take the business from your old man?
- When I die and he grows a pair.

674
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,343
- Oh, shit.

675
00:41:44,183 --> 00:41:45,707
- Some fuckin' party here, huh?

676
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:48,684
- I'd rather be home watching the Knicks.
- Do what, lose?

677
00:41:48,821 --> 00:41:51,984
This is the best game in town, babe.
You got the commissioner over there.

678
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:56,693
It's the worst-kept secret on earth,
him and the mayor can't stand each other.

679
00:41:56,829 --> 00:42:00,526
But the commish don't miss a party.
It's like watching Italian opera, them two.

680
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:02,634
- What the hell do you know about opera?

681
00:42:02,768 --> 00:42:04,201
- Just 'cause I don't understand
the language,

682
00:42:04,336 --> 00:42:06,236
don't mean they ain't out
to fuck each other.

683
00:42:06,372 --> 00:42:08,636
Alright?
- Suite 5101, Mr. Taggart.

684
00:42:08,774 --> 00:42:10,674
I'm told it's urgent.

685
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:12,174
- Excuse me.

686
00:42:13,179 --> 00:42:15,374
- In the neighbourhood, my ass.

687
00:42:35,401 --> 00:42:37,835
- May I offer you a drink, Mr. Taggart?

688
00:42:39,038 --> 00:42:40,505
- I don't drink.

689
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:42,630
- But you used to. I can tell.

690
00:42:44,043 --> 00:42:45,067
- How?

691
00:42:45,211 --> 00:42:48,544
- By those three seconds you let pass
before turning down the drink.

692
00:42:49,048 --> 00:42:50,845
How long has it been?

693
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,641
- Seven years.
- Good for you.

694
00:42:55,054 --> 00:42:57,352
Finally hit rock bottom, huh?

695
00:42:57,489 --> 00:42:59,457
- I did it to keep a woman.

696
00:42:59,592 --> 00:43:01,287
- Then you do believe in love.

697
00:43:01,427 --> 00:43:04,362
- I believe in lovin' the one you're with.
- Hmm. What are you,

698
00:43:04,496 --> 00:43:06,555
stupid or Catholic?

699
00:43:07,666 --> 00:43:08,928
- Both.

700
00:43:09,068 --> 00:43:11,059
- To your health, Mr. Taggart.

701
00:43:17,243 --> 00:43:20,440
- Well... perhaps you could explain
what I'm doin' up here?

702
00:43:22,248 --> 00:43:24,546
- Being tailed is exhausting.

703
00:43:25,684 --> 00:43:29,552
If I might pry for a moment, how much
are you being paid for your efforts?

704
00:43:29,688 --> 00:43:32,748
- Which efforts are those?
- The work you're doing for the mayor.

705
00:43:35,094 --> 00:43:36,959
I'll give you $50,000

706
00:43:37,096 --> 00:43:39,087
to give it up.
- Well, that's very generous,

707
00:43:39,231 --> 00:43:41,825
but I got a contract with the mayor.
- Break it.

708
00:43:41,967 --> 00:43:44,333
- You don't break contract with the mayor.

709
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:47,337
- Don't I know it.
- Why don't you just leave him?

710
00:43:47,473 --> 00:43:49,964
- This is not what you think it is,
Mr. Taggart.

711
00:43:50,109 --> 00:43:52,839
- I take pictures, Mrs. Hostetler.
I don't get paid to think.

712
00:43:52,978 --> 00:43:56,175
- If the last seven years of your life
mean anything,

713
00:43:56,315 --> 00:44:00,251
if that woman you put down the bottle for
means anything... walk...

714
00:44:00,386 --> 00:44:01,785
away.

715
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,979
Because if you think
you're investigating adultery,

716
00:44:04,123 --> 00:44:07,820
Mr. Taggart, you don't know
Nicholas Hostetler very well.

717
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:21,831
- I see you've met Billy.

718
00:44:21,974 --> 00:44:23,498
- Yes, we met.

719
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:26,608
- Did he tell you
he's doing some work for me?

720
00:44:26,745 --> 00:44:30,010
- He mentioned it.
- Did he mention it was exclusive?

721
00:44:30,149 --> 00:44:31,673
- Yes, he did.

722
00:44:31,817 --> 00:44:34,149
- You used to know what exclusive meant,
dear.

723
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,284
In this case, it means I worked for it...

724
00:44:38,157 --> 00:44:40,455
...keep your grubby little paws off it.

725
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,393
- Poor Nicky.

726
00:44:43,529 --> 00:44:46,327
You never did learn how to share, did you?

727
00:44:46,965 --> 00:44:50,765
Well, don't worry...
I'll teach you before it's too late.

728
00:44:52,104 --> 00:44:53,537
- Careful, dear.

729
00:44:53,972 --> 00:44:55,337
- You, too, darling.

730
00:44:57,176 --> 00:44:59,167
Mr. Taggart, please take care.

731
00:45:04,183 --> 00:45:05,480
- I need a drink.

732
00:45:11,557 --> 00:45:13,354
What have you got for me?

733
00:45:14,193 --> 00:45:16,388
- Actually, Mayor,
I think I need a few more days.

734
00:45:16,528 --> 00:45:18,291
I'm pretty sure I got things nailed down,

735
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:20,489
I just wanna take another 48 hours
to confirm.

736
00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:27,931
- You have an envelope... of photographs
in your pocket.

737
00:45:28,073 --> 00:45:31,065
That I paid for. Right?

738
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:32,199
Right?

739
00:45:32,811 --> 00:45:34,676
Burning a hole in your bleeding heart?

740
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:54,759
Good work.

741
00:46:02,841 --> 00:46:04,536
Alright, Billy, we're done.

742
00:46:18,857 --> 00:46:21,485
- Hey, Ryan, you excited tonight?
- Ryan!

743
00:46:23,762 --> 00:46:25,923
- Whoa!

744
00:46:26,064 --> 00:46:28,294
Whoo!

745
00:46:49,455 --> 00:46:51,286
You go, Natalie!

746
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:56,257
Yeah, Natalie! Whoo-hoo!

747
00:46:58,897 --> 00:47:02,094
<i>- I love the line
between the sky and the water.</i>

748
00:47:02,668 --> 00:47:05,159
<i>You see how it gets darker
the farther it is away,</i>

749
00:47:05,304 --> 00:47:06,771
<i>and it's just a line</i>

750
00:47:06,905 --> 00:47:08,964
<i>separating sky from water.</i>

751
00:47:11,176 --> 00:47:14,043
<i>He's religious.
I get it, he's gotta have hope.</i>

752
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:16,010
<i>He's gotta have something to believe in.</i>

753
00:47:16,148 --> 00:47:19,276
<i>- Why do you have to bring him up?
What does it matter?</i>

754
00:47:19,418 --> 00:47:21,886
<i>Not everything in this life
is black and white.</i>

755
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,955
<i>Let's not talk about him anymore.</i>

756
00:47:25,924 --> 00:47:27,118
<i>- Let's go.</i>

757
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,307
<i>- Ah!</i>

758
00:47:55,954 --> 00:47:58,013
- Kiss of Life!
- Kiss of Life!

759
00:47:58,156 --> 00:48:00,522
Sundance, here we come!

760
00:48:02,694 --> 00:48:05,720
- Alright.
- Pretty trippy. Like it?

761
00:48:06,532 --> 00:48:09,092
- It's beautiful.
- Really?

762
00:48:12,738 --> 00:48:14,831
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

763
00:48:14,973 --> 00:48:17,965
- Can I get a double Jameson, please?
- Yeah, you got it.

764
00:48:44,069 --> 00:48:46,629
Again.

765
00:48:46,772 --> 00:48:49,935
- You want a water back for that?
- Just pour the fucking drink, please.

766
00:48:50,075 --> 00:48:52,202
Thank you.

767
00:48:52,344 --> 00:48:53,868
- Billy, what are you doing?

768
00:48:54,012 --> 00:48:55,445
- Hey, Nat, I just...

769
00:48:55,581 --> 00:48:58,448
I just didn't wanna be the only one
not celebrating.

770
00:48:58,584 --> 00:49:00,643
- Billy, don't do this.
- It's a party, right?

771
00:49:00,786 --> 00:49:05,780
And what a fucking movie that was, Nat.
I mean, my God, I never seen you that good.

772
00:49:06,224 --> 00:49:08,454
I mean, that was incredible.
You were so convincing.

773
00:49:08,594 --> 00:49:11,791
- Excuse me.
Can you take this drink back, please?

774
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:14,091
- Please, okay? I'm fine.
- Billy, don't!

775
00:49:14,232 --> 00:49:15,790
That's enough.
- What?

776
00:49:16,535 --> 00:49:19,299
What?
- You promised me, Billy.

777
00:49:19,438 --> 00:49:21,998
How can you hurt me like this?
- How can I hurt you?

778
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,180
You haven't once asked me how I'm feeling...
- This is not your night, Billy.

779
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:28,905
I've worked so hard for this.
It doesn't mean anything to you, does it?

780
00:49:29,047 --> 00:49:32,574
You know, why don't you go do a line, too?
Go back to being the old Billy,

781
00:49:32,718 --> 00:49:34,652
'cause everybody knows
what a great guy he was.

782
00:49:34,786 --> 00:49:37,687
I'm gonna go hang out with my friends.
- You mean Ryan?

783
00:49:37,823 --> 00:49:40,348
What, d'you fuck him?
- Don't do this.

784
00:49:40,492 --> 00:49:42,153
- Fine. I'll go ask him myself.
- Billy.

785
00:49:42,294 --> 00:49:43,921
Just go home. Please?

786
00:49:44,062 --> 00:49:45,942
- Tell me the truth
or I'll start breakin' shit.

787
00:49:46,064 --> 00:49:49,329
- There's nothing left for you to break.
- Tell me the truth.

788
00:49:49,468 --> 00:49:52,096
You told me it was gonna be artistic,
some simple love scene.

789
00:49:52,237 --> 00:49:54,262
- I can't do this anymore.
- You can't do this?

790
00:49:54,406 --> 00:49:56,169
What the fuck does that mean?!
- We're in pieces.

791
00:49:56,308 --> 00:49:58,509
We've always been in pieces.
- I'm taking you home. Now!

792
00:49:58,644 --> 00:50:01,078
- Are you not listening to me?
- No, I'm not listening, Nat!

793
00:50:01,213 --> 00:50:04,444
And you're not leaving me, not here,
not for this bunch of fuckin' assholes!

794
00:50:11,657 --> 00:50:14,182
- I can't.
- Nat. Please.

795
00:50:14,326 --> 00:50:16,294
Natalie.

796
00:50:17,496 --> 00:50:18,656
I'm sorry.

797
00:50:19,665 --> 00:50:21,963
- There's nothing left between us, Billy.

798
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,727
- Don't say that. I'm sorry.
- Nothing.

799
00:50:23,869 --> 00:50:27,532
We've had a dead girl holding us
together for seven years.

800
00:50:27,673 --> 00:50:29,732
It's just not enough anymore.

801
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:32,036
- How could you say that?

802
00:50:32,177 --> 00:50:35,408
Natalie, ple... I'm sorry.
- Nat, you alright?

803
00:50:35,547 --> 00:50:37,913
- Yeah.
- Billy, stop it! No!

804
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:40,041
Let him go.

805
00:50:40,185 --> 00:50:42,380
Billy, please, please.
- Fuckin' actor.

806
00:50:42,521 --> 00:50:44,352
Yeah, you fucked him.

807
00:50:58,236 --> 00:50:59,794
Aw, what the...

808
00:50:59,938 --> 00:51:01,803
What the fuck are you doing?

809
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,908
Wait a second. What the fuck?

810
00:51:16,722 --> 00:51:19,213
Y'know what?
I've wasted my fuckin' money!

811
00:51:19,357 --> 00:51:22,349
And I waste my fucking time!

812
00:51:48,186 --> 00:51:49,380
Natalie?

813
00:51:50,589 --> 00:51:52,580
Katy, I can't talk right now.

814
00:51:54,593 --> 00:51:55,582
What?

815
00:51:56,595 --> 00:51:58,961
Katy, don't fuck with me.
What are you saying?

816
00:52:01,767 --> 00:52:02,961
Shit.

817
00:52:08,406 --> 00:52:11,842
<i>Reports of multiple gunshots
in the vicinity of Jane and Washington.</i>

818
00:52:11,977 --> 00:52:15,743
<i>One victim reported.
Medical assistance is en route.</i>

819
00:52:16,448 --> 00:52:19,728
- Stand back. Right behind the line.
- Please, everybody, stay back.

820
00:52:19,785 --> 00:52:21,480
- Thank you.
- Hey, Tony!

821
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,281
- He's with me.
- Okay.

822
00:52:25,223 --> 00:52:27,088
- Thanks for doing this, Jansen.
- You got it.

823
00:52:27,225 --> 00:52:30,661
We get the first call just after one.
Report of gunshots.

824
00:52:30,796 --> 00:52:33,856
Six more calls inside a minute, all 2-11 s.

825
00:52:33,999 --> 00:52:36,661
First units arrive
around three minutes later,

826
00:52:36,802 --> 00:52:39,293
he's already good and dead by then.
- What's it look like?

827
00:52:39,437 --> 00:52:42,565
- Well, so far, so good on robbery.
He didn't have a wallet on him,

828
00:52:42,707 --> 00:52:45,175
but his apartment's right here,
so maybe he left it inside.

829
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:48,108
We're working on getting the landlord
down here to let us in.

830
00:52:48,246 --> 00:52:50,806
- Any cash when you found him?
- No keys, no cash.

831
00:52:50,949 --> 00:52:53,315
Like I said: so far, so good on robbery.

832
00:52:53,451 --> 00:52:56,818
So when's the last time, uh,
you seen one of these?

833
00:53:05,497 --> 00:53:07,021
- You're not really thinking robbery?

834
00:53:07,165 --> 00:53:08,689
- No, we're spinning robbery.

835
00:53:08,834 --> 00:53:11,234
Media's pushing robbery.
It's a counterfactual robbery.

836
00:53:11,369 --> 00:53:15,362
Now it's your turn, Taggart.
What the hell's this got to do with you?

837
00:53:15,507 --> 00:53:17,134
- That's funny, Billy.

838
00:53:17,275 --> 00:53:20,039
I was just about to ask you that
my damn self.

839
00:53:23,548 --> 00:53:25,311
Stay with me, Billy. This is what I got.

840
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:28,283
I got a former-NYPD-detective-
turned-private-eye

841
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,354
at a fundraiser for the mayor.

842
00:53:30,488 --> 00:53:31,921
His mother's life depended on it,

843
00:53:32,057 --> 00:53:34,890
he couldn't find the money
to afford a ticket to this thing.

844
00:53:35,026 --> 00:53:37,324
That's Thursday.
Then - this is the good part -

845
00:53:37,462 --> 00:53:42,661
24 hours later, at the murder scene
of the man running the campaign

846
00:53:42,801 --> 00:53:45,235
to unseat the mayor,
whoo, imagine,

847
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:47,031
that very same private eye.

848
00:53:47,172 --> 00:53:48,901
Explain that to me, Billy.

849
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,701
Is this Hostetler?

850
00:53:50,876 --> 00:53:54,004
Is this what you gave him last night?
You gave him Andrews?

851
00:53:54,145 --> 00:53:56,579
- I gave him pictures.
- You gave him pictures.

852
00:53:56,715 --> 00:53:58,615
Of who? Who were the pictures of?

853
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,342
- His wife.
- His wife and who?

854
00:54:00,485 --> 00:54:03,079
- Oh, I can't tell you that.

855
00:54:04,322 --> 00:54:06,381
- You better start telling me something.

856
00:54:06,524 --> 00:54:09,186
Explain to me what you're doing
at my crime scene.

857
00:54:09,327 --> 00:54:12,592
- I was in the neighbourhood.
- You were just in the neighbourhood.

858
00:54:14,165 --> 00:54:15,598
Paul Andrews is dead!

859
00:54:15,734 --> 00:54:18,862
What, you think you're gonna piss on him
and walk away?

860
00:54:19,004 --> 00:54:21,598
This is an execution.
This is a fucking assassination.

861
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:24,607
Did you finger Andrews?
This what you do now, Billy,

862
00:54:24,743 --> 00:54:26,438
you set up executions?
- Fuck you.

863
00:54:26,578 --> 00:54:28,102
- Fuck me?
- Fuck you.

864
00:54:28,246 --> 00:54:32,444
I took a job, Chief. I didn't ask questions.
I gave him pictures and I walked away.

865
00:54:32,584 --> 00:54:34,814
Oh, you think I gave him up to get murdered?

866
00:54:34,953 --> 00:54:38,514
- I think you're too damned smart to think
you were setting him up for anything else.

867
00:54:38,657 --> 00:54:40,284
- Fuck you! I did my job!
- No.

868
00:54:40,425 --> 00:54:42,893
You fuckin' knew.
- I did my job.

869
00:54:43,028 --> 00:54:45,121
- Commissioner.
- Get outta here.

870
00:54:45,263 --> 00:54:47,231
Let me tell you something, Billy.

871
00:54:47,365 --> 00:54:49,993
I'm taking Hostetler down.

872
00:54:50,135 --> 00:54:54,003
He sees election day,
it'll be from inside a cage like a monkey.

873
00:54:54,139 --> 00:54:56,130
Now, you either help me,

874
00:54:56,274 --> 00:54:59,141
or you'll be in there
with him sucking on bananas, too.

875
00:55:02,781 --> 00:55:04,146
What?

876
00:55:04,282 --> 00:55:06,773
- Commissioner, there's an issue.

877
00:55:07,385 --> 00:55:09,148
- Something up, Commissioner?

878
00:55:10,155 --> 00:55:12,385
- You're on the door, Detective.
Nobody gets in here.

879
00:55:12,524 --> 00:55:14,583
- All due respect...
- You're on the fucking door.

880
00:55:27,405 --> 00:55:28,929
Now, Jack...

881
00:55:29,975 --> 00:55:32,170
What happened tonight, Jack?

882
00:55:36,614 --> 00:55:39,048
Don't worry about him, he's with me.

883
00:55:42,988 --> 00:55:44,979
Everyone's with you.

884
00:55:45,991 --> 00:55:48,585
- I need you to look at me, Jack.

885
00:55:48,994 --> 00:55:51,053
Talk to me, okay?

886
00:55:51,196 --> 00:55:53,687
Put the whiskey down, Jack. Okay?

887
00:55:56,001 --> 00:55:57,628
Okay, Jack?

888
00:56:01,006 --> 00:56:02,633
Okay.

889
00:56:03,441 --> 00:56:06,808
You need to straighten up, Jack.
Lock the door.

890
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:14,208
It's gonna be okay, Jack.

891
00:56:24,729 --> 00:56:26,856
Just tell me exactly what happened.

892
00:56:30,869 --> 00:56:32,860
- Y'know, you're not a real cop.

893
00:56:33,671 --> 00:56:35,639
You're just a whore.

894
00:56:55,393 --> 00:56:57,953
- We're gonna go for a walk
and get some fresh air.

895
00:56:58,096 --> 00:57:00,724
It'll make you feel better, okay?
Don't worry about that guy.

896
00:57:00,865 --> 00:57:02,355
- I wanna help you, Jack.

897
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,560
But I have to know what happened;
we don't have a lot of time.

898
00:57:05,703 --> 00:57:07,637
I need you to talk to me, you understand?

899
00:57:07,772 --> 00:57:10,138
- I'm done talkin' to you.
Fuckin' whore. Fuck you!

900
00:57:10,275 --> 00:57:12,641
- You're talking,
but you're not making a lot of sense.

901
00:57:12,777 --> 00:57:14,074
Clear his mind, Billy.

902
00:57:14,212 --> 00:57:15,702
- No!!

903
00:57:31,963 --> 00:57:33,089
- Okay.

904
00:57:40,738 --> 00:57:42,296
- He went, um...

905
00:57:43,308 --> 00:57:45,173
...downstairs to meet...

906
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:47,107
Todd Lancaster...

907
00:57:48,546 --> 00:57:50,309
Called earlier and...

908
00:57:51,316 --> 00:57:54,183
...he told Paul he was ready to...

909
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:55,752
to talk.

910
00:57:57,956 --> 00:58:00,618
He said he was ashamed of himself

911
00:58:00,758 --> 00:58:02,191
for helping us.

912
00:58:02,327 --> 00:58:03,954
But he was, um...

913
00:58:04,762 --> 00:58:07,822
...he was more ashamed of his father and...

914
00:58:07,966 --> 00:58:10,332
he just wanted it to stop.

915
00:58:13,571 --> 00:58:16,131
I think Paul lost track of time...

916
00:58:16,574 --> 00:58:19,771
...'cause he looked at the clock
and he, um...

917
00:58:21,146 --> 00:58:23,137
...just ran downstairs.

918
00:58:24,582 --> 00:58:26,140
That was the...

919
00:58:27,152 --> 00:58:29,347
...the last time I saw him.

920
00:58:30,355 --> 00:58:33,017
- Did you hear any voices outside?

921
00:58:33,158 --> 00:58:35,149
An altercation, maybe?

922
00:58:35,793 --> 00:58:36,919
- No.

923
00:58:38,163 --> 00:58:39,994
Just the shots.

924
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:48,396
I knew I c-couldn't go out there,

925
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:51,236
I knew I... couldn't call the police,

926
00:58:51,376 --> 00:58:53,173
couldn't be seen here.

927
00:58:55,013 --> 00:58:57,208
I knew everything I couldn't do.

928
00:58:58,383 --> 00:59:01,181
Jack Valliant, candidate for mayor...

929
00:59:03,021 --> 00:59:04,613
...couldn't do.

930
00:59:05,323 --> 00:59:08,019
You know what this means, Jack?

931
00:59:09,827 --> 00:59:13,024
- Yeah, it means I let him lie out there.

932
00:59:16,634 --> 00:59:19,068
It means I let him die alone.

933
00:59:19,204 --> 00:59:21,195
- It means you can handle this.

934
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,198
Look at me, Jack.

935
00:59:25,009 --> 00:59:28,706
You are gonna be the next mayor
of New York City.

936
00:59:28,846 --> 00:59:30,837
You've gotta handle this.

937
00:59:31,883 --> 00:59:34,283
Now, you go get dressed,

938
00:59:34,419 --> 00:59:36,751
find yourself a hat and a coat with a collar,

939
00:59:36,888 --> 00:59:39,288
and we are gonna get you outta here
real quiet.

940
00:59:43,194 --> 00:59:44,218
Yeah.

941
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:46,322
Right.

942
00:59:48,433 --> 00:59:50,526
You've gotta get him outta here.

943
00:59:50,668 --> 00:59:52,226
I'm on my way.

944
00:59:52,437 --> 00:59:54,029
- How involved are you?

945
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,169
- It's complicated.

946
01:00:01,446 --> 01:00:05,177
You should give me a day
to gather my bearings. We'll talk.

947
01:00:33,278 --> 01:00:35,143
- What a fucking mess.

948
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,907
- A tragedy, sir.

949
01:00:38,916 --> 01:00:41,714
- The press are gonna want heads to roll
over this.

950
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,478
- I beg your pardon, sir?

951
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:47,720
- You know how it goes, Commissioner.

952
01:00:48,493 --> 01:00:51,724
You either give 'em an arrest,
or we give them a resignation.

953
01:00:52,297 --> 01:00:54,731
- Then we'll have to give 'em an arrest.

954
01:00:59,504 --> 01:01:01,734
<i>Tragedy in the West Village.</i>

955
01:01:01,873 --> 01:01:05,331
<i>Paul Andrews, campaign manager
for mayoral candidate Jack Valliant,</i>

956
01:01:05,476 --> 01:01:08,377
<i>was found shot to death overnight
outside his Jane St. apartment.</i>

957
01:01:08,513 --> 01:01:10,473
<i>Police questioned witnesses
well into the morning,</i>

958
01:01:10,481 --> 01:01:12,176
<i>but no suspects have been detained.</i>

959
01:01:12,317 --> 01:01:15,252
<i>Police Commissioner Carl Fairbanks,
a personal friend of Andrews,</i>

960
01:01:15,386 --> 01:01:18,321
<i>says the investigation will receive
the department's highest priority.</i>

961
01:01:18,456 --> 01:01:21,448
<i>We've got a report
from the 10th St. Station...</i>

962
01:01:26,764 --> 01:01:28,527
- He was a better man than me.

963
01:01:30,768 --> 01:01:32,531
He should've been mayor.

964
01:01:37,775 --> 01:01:39,402
- You and Andrews, you were, uh...

965
01:01:39,544 --> 01:01:40,772
together?

966
01:01:41,179 --> 01:01:44,774
- There's this quote I remember.
I don't know where I heard it.

967
01:01:45,983 --> 01:01:47,780
I just always remember it.

968
01:01:49,987 --> 01:01:52,182
Maybe something I read in undergrad.

969
01:01:56,361 --> 01:01:59,797
"And it's just not popular, or safe...

970
01:02:00,565 --> 01:02:02,795
...to say that I loved him."

971
01:02:28,025 --> 01:02:29,925
<i>- Mr. Mayor,</i>

972
01:02:30,061 --> 01:02:32,086
have you spoken to Councilman Valliant?
- I have.

973
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:34,721
I reached out to the councilman
this morning.

974
01:02:34,866 --> 01:02:37,426
I offered him
not only my deepest condolences,

975
01:02:37,568 --> 01:02:40,696
<i>but also my personal assurance
that we will do everything we can</i>

976
01:02:40,838 --> 01:02:43,272
<i>to bring the perpetrators of this crime
to justice.</i>

977
01:02:43,408 --> 01:02:45,740
<i>- Mr. Mayor, did you know Paul Andrews?</i>

978
01:02:45,877 --> 01:02:48,846
<i>- I only met, uh, Mr. Andrews a few times.</i>

979
01:02:49,614 --> 01:02:52,242
<i>He always struck me as a very genuine man,</i>

980
01:02:52,383 --> 01:02:54,283
<i>a very hardworking man.</i>

981
01:02:54,419 --> 01:02:57,252
<i>He loved this city, he loved the people.</i>

982
01:02:58,423 --> 01:03:01,290
<i>He and my wife actually were, uh...</i>

983
01:03:01,426 --> 01:03:03,121
good friends.

984
01:03:03,261 --> 01:03:04,785
So this definitely hits home.

985
01:03:04,929 --> 01:03:07,420
<i>Thank you all. Thank you all very much.</i>

986
01:03:07,565 --> 01:03:09,126
<i>-... what kind of man Paul Andrews was?</i>

987
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,758
<i>- Hang on a minute.
- Well, he was...</i>

988
01:03:10,902 --> 01:03:14,338
<i>the kind of man who loved
and... and fought with his whole heart.</i>

989
01:03:14,472 --> 01:03:16,633
<i>He was a dear friend to all of us,</i>

990
01:03:16,774 --> 01:03:19,004
<i>the driving force behind the success
of this campaign.</i>

991
01:03:19,143 --> 01:03:22,635
<i>He'll be dearly missed.
- This must be an extremely difficult time.</i>

992
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:24,941
<i>Have you considered
suspending your campaign?</i>

993
01:03:25,082 --> 01:03:26,515
<i>- No, absolutely not.</i>

994
01:03:26,651 --> 01:03:28,983
<i>The debate will continue
as scheduled tomorrow.</i>

995
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,281
<i>The, uh, election on Tuesday.</i>

996
01:03:31,956 --> 01:03:35,551
<i>We refuse to allow some thug
to prevent this city</i>

997
01:03:35,693 --> 01:03:38,287
<i>from exercising its democratic rights.
Thank you.</i>

998
01:03:40,097 --> 01:03:42,463
- Paul Andrews definitely wasn't fucking
the mayor's wife.

999
01:03:43,468 --> 01:03:45,800
We're looking for a guy
named Todd Lancaster.

1000
01:03:45,937 --> 01:03:48,497
Just find me what you can on him,
and... Bolton Village;

1001
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:50,539
dig up whatever you can on the sale.

1002
01:03:50,675 --> 01:03:52,404
- Okay. I'm on it.

1003
01:04:00,084 --> 01:04:01,483
Billy.

1004
01:04:03,488 --> 01:04:05,752
You know it's not your fault.

1005
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:16,130
- Gotta go.

1006
01:04:49,166 --> 01:04:51,726
Sir, he just walked
into Bolton Village.

1007
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:53,735
Yes, sir.

1008
01:04:54,071 --> 01:04:56,369
Daddy!

1009
01:05:05,383 --> 01:05:08,546
<i>Drop the gun, Mikey!
Drop the fucking gun!</i>

1010
01:05:10,187 --> 01:05:13,918
<i>I didn't fucking do nothin'!
Yo, chill, man, what the fuck, man?!</i>

1011
01:05:14,058 --> 01:05:16,754
<i>It's okay, Mikey,
we just wanna talk.</i>

01:06:05,042 --> 01:06:08,808
<i>Oh, Billy! Come in, come in. Hi!
- Hola.</i>

1017
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:11,480
- Where is Natalia?

1018
01:06:11,616 --> 01:06:13,811
- Actually I came alone, Mrs. Barea.

1019
01:06:14,251 --> 01:06:16,481
She's just been really busy lately
with the movie.

1020
01:06:16,621 --> 01:06:18,612
- Ah, yes, the movie.

1021
01:06:19,624 --> 01:06:23,458
<i>Natalia sa quita la ropa, como una puta.</i>

1022
01:06:24,261 --> 01:06:26,695
<i>Raul, mira quien es a qui.</i>

1023
01:06:26,831 --> 01:06:29,925
<i>- Como esta, Senor Barea?
- Hi, Billy.</i>

1024
01:06:30,067 --> 01:06:31,694
Good to see you.
- You, too.

1025
01:06:31,836 --> 01:06:33,497
- How are you, man?

1026
01:06:33,638 --> 01:06:35,936
<i>- Billy, quiere un café?
- Uh, mucho gusto. Gracias.</i>

1027
01:06:36,073 --> 01:06:37,802
- Okay.

1028
01:06:37,942 --> 01:06:40,274
- Good to see you.

1029
01:06:41,078 --> 01:06:42,340
- So...

1030
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,880
what brings you back
to the old neighbourhood, huh?

1031
01:06:45,016 --> 01:06:48,144
- Uh, that's a good question.
I'm not really sure.

1032
01:06:48,285 --> 01:06:50,344
- Nostalgia can be hard to explain.

1033
01:06:50,488 --> 01:06:52,080
- Yeah.

1034
01:06:52,657 --> 01:06:54,852
- Hey, is everything...

1035
01:06:54,992 --> 01:06:56,960
all right between you and my daughter?

1036
01:06:57,662 --> 01:07:00,096
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Good.

1037
01:07:02,867 --> 01:07:04,630
- Why'd you stay here, Raul?

1038
01:07:05,302 --> 01:07:08,499
Wh-wh-where would we go?

1039
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:10,559
- Anywhere. I never got it.
Natalie never got it.

1040
01:07:10,675 --> 01:07:12,336
How could you just stay here?

1041
01:07:12,476 --> 01:07:16,879
- Oh, I-I-I-I could never leave
my Yesenia behind.

1042
01:07:17,982 --> 01:07:21,247
- She's gone, Raul.
- No, Billy, no, no, no.

1043
01:07:21,385 --> 01:07:22,875
She is here.

1044
01:07:25,122 --> 01:07:28,683
Look, I know how much you gave up
that night.

1045
01:07:29,126 --> 01:07:32,323
But you... also gave us peace.

1046
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:37,527
And you...

1047
01:07:37,668 --> 01:07:39,761
gave Yesenia justice.

1048
01:07:39,904 --> 01:07:41,132
Huh?

1049
01:07:42,707 --> 01:07:45,540
And I can't begin to tell you how much...

1050
01:07:45,676 --> 01:07:48,543
that means to me, and to my... my wife.

1051
01:07:52,149 --> 01:07:53,582
<i>Gracias.</i>

1052
01:07:53,718 --> 01:07:55,151
- So, Billy...

1053
01:07:56,554 --> 01:07:58,545
...have you seen this movie?

1054
01:08:06,931 --> 01:08:08,364
- Raise your arms.

1055
01:08:09,567 --> 01:08:11,660
- Kevin. Give us a few moments.

1056
01:08:17,575 --> 01:08:20,669
- Thank you for meeting me, Mrs. Hostetler.
- What do you want, Mr. Taggart?

1057
01:08:21,178 --> 01:08:22,736
- I wanna know what's going on.

1058
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,179
- Oh, you want to know what's going on?
You couldn't care less the other night.

1059
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:29,743
Paul Andrews was my friend, Mr. Taggart.

1060
01:08:29,887 --> 01:08:32,048
Do you understand that?

1061
01:08:32,189 --> 01:08:34,749
My very dear friend.

1062
01:08:36,193 --> 01:08:39,128
And if you weren't such a cut-rate dick,

1063
01:08:39,263 --> 01:08:41,595
maybe he would still be alive today.

1064
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,192
But you are cut-rate.

1065
01:08:44,769 --> 01:08:47,966
You're cheap to hire
and you're cheaper to throw away.

1066
01:08:49,774 --> 01:08:53,642
I gave you the opportunity
to do the right thing and you refused.

1067
01:08:53,778 --> 01:08:57,509
- You're right. And I'm sorry
about your friend, Mrs. Hostetler.

1068
01:08:57,648 --> 01:08:59,445
But your husband set me up.

1069
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:01,778
And I'm gonna destroy him for it.

1070
01:09:01,919 --> 01:09:04,513
I need you to understand that
and I need you to know

1071
01:09:04,655 --> 01:09:07,249
that I'll do whatever it takes
to bring that sonofabitch down.

1072
01:09:07,391 --> 01:09:09,791
But first you have to tell me,
what's going on?

1073
01:09:10,427 --> 01:09:13,760
- You weren't hired to look for my lover,
Mr. Taggart.

1074
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:16,790
You were looking for my source.

1075
01:09:17,101 --> 01:09:19,001
I discovered some information

1076
01:09:19,136 --> 01:09:21,001
about the mayor a while back.

1077
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:25,231
If it was ever brought to light,
it would ruin him.

1078
01:09:25,442 --> 01:09:27,501
I offered him a deal:

1079
01:09:27,645 --> 01:09:30,512
I get a divorce, a reasonable settlement,

1080
01:09:30,648 --> 01:09:32,639
he gets my silence.

1081
01:09:32,783 --> 01:09:34,341
- He didn't take the deal.

1082
01:09:34,485 --> 01:09:37,010
- No. He hired you.

1083
01:09:38,455 --> 01:09:40,013
It was Paul.

1084
01:09:41,458 --> 01:09:43,653
Paul gave me the information.

1085
01:09:44,461 --> 01:09:46,190
He thought by sharing it with me,

1086
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:49,356
he would help me in my situation
and I could help him

1087
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:53,061
by looking into it from my side.
- Looking into what?

1088
01:09:53,204 --> 01:09:55,331
- The Bolton Village sale.

1089
01:09:55,472 --> 01:09:58,339
Four-billion dollars
is a helluva lot of money

1090
01:09:58,475 --> 01:10:01,740
for a few city blocks of housing projects,
Mr. Taggart, wouldn't you say?

1091
01:10:01,879 --> 01:10:05,007
- Yeah.
- It's worth twice that.

1092
01:10:05,282 --> 01:10:08,183
He's a dangerous man, Billy.
- No.

1093
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:10,810
He only knows people that kill people.

1094
01:10:22,299 --> 01:10:24,767
<i>What do you got, Katy?
- I got a hit on Todd Lancaster.</i>

1095
01:10:24,902 --> 01:10:27,928
<i>He works for his father Sam's
construction and demolition company</i>

1096
01:10:28,072 --> 01:10:30,768
<i>called the Rochway Group.
Sam...</i>

1097
01:10:30,908 --> 01:10:35,436
<i>is one of the mayor's biggest donors,
which is interesting, 'cause the son, Todd,</i>

1098
01:10:35,579 --> 01:10:39,174
<i>is like besties with Paul Andrews.
Or, uh, he was. Sorry.</i>

1099
01:10:39,316 --> 01:10:43,480
<i>Andrews was like an alumni mentor to Todd
at Columbia. He took him under his wing,</i>

1100
01:10:43,621 --> 01:10:47,523
<i>and now they serve on a bunch of boards
for all these, like, liberal organizations.</i>

1101
01:10:47,658 --> 01:10:49,785
<i>Anyway, I got a home address for Todd</i>

1102
01:10:49,927 --> 01:10:53,363
<i>out in Port Washington,
but the office is out by the Navy Yards,</i>

1103
01:10:53,497 --> 01:10:55,328
<i>so maybe you wanna try there first.</i>

1104
01:10:55,466 --> 01:10:57,400
<i>But, um, Billy, just be careful, alright?</i>

1105
01:10:57,534 --> 01:10:59,468
<i>Paul Andrews was just murdered and...</i>

1106
01:10:59,603 --> 01:11:02,902
<i>I'm sure it's gonna be
a shit storm out there.</i>

1107
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:05,159
- You're kidding me. You gotta be...

1108
01:12:31,462 --> 01:12:34,625
Get in here!

1109
01:12:42,206 --> 01:12:44,401
Hey, look at me.

1110
01:12:44,541 --> 01:12:47,135
You're a fucking idiot!
- Stop fuckin' hitting me!

1111
01:12:47,277 --> 01:12:49,643
- You're the reason this is happening!

1112
01:13:14,872 --> 01:13:17,306
- Shit!

1113
01:13:29,486 --> 01:13:30,885
Shit.

1114
01:13:38,362 --> 01:13:39,659
Ah!!

1115
01:13:40,697 --> 01:13:42,722
Ah!!

1116
01:13:44,268 --> 01:13:46,998
C'mon!

1117
01:13:54,711 --> 01:13:56,508
Ah, fuck.

1118
01:14:01,618 --> 01:14:03,552
- Ah!!
- Watch out!

1119
01:14:04,588 --> 01:14:05,919
- Ah!!

1120
01:14:31,115 --> 01:14:32,742
- Hope you got insurance.

1121
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:35,814
- Why? The other guy
didn't leave his information?

1122
01:14:35,953 --> 01:14:38,114
- Nah, but we'll get him.
- How you gonna manage that?

1123
01:14:39,323 --> 01:14:41,120
- Camera over there.

1124
01:14:42,626 --> 01:14:45,459
- How long it take you to get that footage?
- Depends.

1125
01:14:45,596 --> 01:14:47,325
You got a powerful uncle?

1126
01:14:47,965 --> 01:14:49,125
- I might.

1127
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:56,433
<i>- Thank you for calling the Roosevelt Hotel.</i>

1128
01:14:56,573 --> 01:14:58,837
<i>- What'd you say?
- The Roosevelt Hotel.</i>

1129
01:14:58,976 --> 01:15:01,843
- Yeah, I'm looking for a Carl Fairbanks.

1130
01:15:01,979 --> 01:15:04,846
<i>- I'm sorry, sir, but the Commissioner
hasn't set up his voice mail.</i>

1131
01:15:04,982 --> 01:15:07,314
<i>May I take a message?
- We done here?</i>

1132
01:15:07,451 --> 01:15:08,975
- Yeah, we good.

1133
01:15:22,599 --> 01:15:25,159
- Found a little trouble tonight, huh, Billy?

1134
01:15:25,369 --> 01:15:27,360
- Yeah, you could call it that.

1135
01:15:28,372 --> 01:15:30,169
Leave the bottle, Harry.

1136
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:35,669
- Ah, you come here often?

1137
01:15:35,812 --> 01:15:38,246
- You trying to get in my drawers, Billy?

1138
01:15:38,382 --> 01:15:39,610
Huh?

1139
01:15:40,017 --> 01:15:41,848
What's next?
You gonna ask me for my sign?

1140
01:15:41,985 --> 01:15:44,579
- I bet you're the one
with two fuckin' faces.

1141
01:15:44,721 --> 01:15:47,383
- What, Gemini?
Close, Billy, I'm the bull.

1142
01:15:48,192 --> 01:15:49,887
What about you?

1143
01:15:50,027 --> 01:15:51,187
- Cancer.

1144
01:15:51,828 --> 01:15:53,625
Roosevelt, huh?

1145
01:15:54,631 --> 01:15:57,930
Pretty choice address for a cop.
Even if he is commissioner.

1146
01:15:58,068 --> 01:16:00,730
- I made some sound investments.
- Oh, I bet you did.

1147
01:16:00,871 --> 01:16:04,602
Not to mention that place out on Montauk?
Must've set you back a few mill at least.

1148
01:16:04,741 --> 01:16:08,074
What are you, the new Russell Simmons now?
You doin' yoga and fucking white women?

1149
01:16:08,212 --> 01:16:09,941
- That's cute, Billy.

1150
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:11,707
- Tell me something, Commissioner.

1151
01:16:11,848 --> 01:16:14,817
The First Lady, she upstairs right now?

1152
01:16:15,419 --> 01:16:17,080
- Be careful, Billy.

1153
01:16:17,221 --> 01:16:20,054
I know that's why you were so concerned
about those pictures.

1154
01:16:20,424 --> 01:16:22,722
You were afraid you were in them.

1155
01:16:22,859 --> 01:16:25,293
That's why you took me upstairs,
and not Jansen.

1156
01:16:25,429 --> 01:16:27,397
- What do you want?
- I want Hostetler.

1157
01:16:27,531 --> 01:16:28,964
- Get in line.

1158
01:16:29,099 --> 01:16:31,090
- I almost had him tonight.

1159
01:16:31,235 --> 01:16:32,896
I had papers in my trunk,

1160
01:16:33,036 --> 01:16:35,061
a fuckin' boxful,
all with mockups and renderings

1161
01:16:35,205 --> 01:16:37,799
of some New York skyline
that doesn't exist right now,

1162
01:16:37,941 --> 01:16:40,205
but will as soon
as they tear down Bolton Village.

1163
01:16:40,344 --> 01:16:43,575
Until some goons blind-sided me.
- Yeah, we ID'ed him from his license plate.

1164
01:16:43,714 --> 01:16:45,272
- Who is he?

1165
01:16:45,415 --> 01:16:47,246
- Ex-homicide cop. Dick Murdock.

1166
01:16:47,384 --> 01:16:49,784
You know him?
- Yeah, he works for Sam Lancaster.

1167
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,754
- He might work for Sam Lancaster,
but he's on Hostetler's payroll.

1168
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:56,552
- Say again?
- All that paperwork you got in your trunk,

1169
01:16:56,693 --> 01:16:59,719
not to diminish your new beauty mark,
but it's fucking worthless.

1170
01:17:00,697 --> 01:17:02,927
Everyone knows Solstein Donagan's
gonna tear down Bolton Village

1171
01:17:03,066 --> 01:17:04,795
as soon as the political dust settles.

1172
01:17:04,935 --> 01:17:08,302
A few even know they already hired
the Rochway Group to do it.

1173
01:17:08,438 --> 01:17:11,430
- Really? So why is Paul Andrews dead
if it was such an open secret?

1174
01:17:11,575 --> 01:17:15,773
- Well, he was about to figure out the rest.
- What rest? What fuckin' rest?

1175
01:17:15,912 --> 01:17:20,042
Doesn't anybody in this town
speak in complete fuckin' sentences anymore?

1176
01:17:21,285 --> 01:17:26,348
- Todd Lancaster was meeting with Andrews
that night to bring him a contract.

1177
01:17:26,490 --> 01:17:28,788
Somebody didn't want that to happen.

1178
01:17:28,925 --> 01:17:33,794
Now, I myself almost secured the contract
from Todd, but now he's not talking.

1179
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:35,295
He's scared.

1180
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:39,929
- Well, the contract is proof of the deal
to tear down Bolton Village.

1181
01:17:40,737 --> 01:17:43,297
- That's part of it.

1182
01:17:46,343 --> 01:17:48,140
Only Todd Lancaster knows the other part.

1183
01:17:50,314 --> 01:17:51,542
Harry.

1184
01:17:51,682 --> 01:17:54,981
- Whatever he wants. On me.
- Good night, Commissioner.

1185
01:17:55,118 --> 01:17:56,745
Good night, Commissioner.

1186
01:18:04,528 --> 01:18:06,155
<i>Places, everyone.</i>

1187
01:18:06,296 --> 01:18:07,763
We're live in five.

1188
01:18:11,768 --> 01:18:13,360
- Good evening, New York.

1189
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:16,700
And welcome to third and final
New York City mayoral debate.

1190
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,502
At this time,
join me in welcoming our candidates:

1191
01:18:19,643 --> 01:18:22,168
Mayor Nicholas Hostetler
and Councilman Jack Valliant.

1192
01:18:32,189 --> 01:18:34,350
- Hey. How much?

1193
01:18:34,491 --> 01:18:36,686
- Manual windows?
- Yeah.

1194
01:18:36,827 --> 01:18:38,761
- That's how you got
those masculine forearms.

1195
01:18:38,895 --> 01:18:40,863
- Where'd you think I got 'em,
from stroking your ego?

1196
01:18:40,997 --> 01:18:43,693
Big booty: good.
Big forearms: no good.

1197
01:18:43,834 --> 01:18:46,735
C'mon, let me drive. What the fuck?

1198
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:49,430
- You're an asshole!
- I didn't do it on purpose! Let me drive.

1199
01:18:49,573 --> 01:18:52,440
- Oh, my God! You ruined my car
before you even started driving it.

1200
01:18:52,576 --> 01:18:54,009
- I apologize.
- Where are we goin' again?

1201
01:18:54,144 --> 01:18:56,669
- Don't worry about it. Get in.
- What do you think I'm doing?

1202
01:18:56,813 --> 01:19:00,078
- Whoa. Where'd you get these seat covers,
the Gaza Strip?

1203
01:19:00,217 --> 01:19:04,051
- In a Valliant administration,
we will be focusing on two key principals:

1204
01:19:04,187 --> 01:19:07,122
Shared responsibility and shared sacrifice.

1205
01:19:07,257 --> 01:19:11,318
<i>For those of you who are fortunate enough
to earn more than $200,000 a year,</i>

1206
01:19:11,461 --> 01:19:14,055
<i>we'll ask that you pay
a little more in taxes.</i>

1207
01:19:14,197 --> 01:19:18,099
<i>For those of you who don't,
well, we'll bring down the payroll tax.</i>

1208
01:19:18,235 --> 01:19:20,635
It's responsible and it moves us forward

1209
01:19:20,771 --> 01:19:22,572
towards a balanced budget
and a secure future.

1210
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,439
- Mayor.

1211
01:19:25,575 --> 01:19:27,839
- I think it is laughable that my opponent

1212
01:19:27,978 --> 01:19:29,969
can be up here
espousing fiscal responsibility

1213
01:19:30,113 --> 01:19:35,073
when it is a known fact he has never
met a tax he didn't want to raise.

1214
01:19:35,218 --> 01:19:36,981
- Ooh...
- This coming from the man

1215
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,486
whose policies landed us
in a billion-dollar deficit.

1216
01:19:39,623 --> 01:19:41,523
- No, this is coming from the mayor

1217
01:19:41,658 --> 01:19:43,626
who got us out of it.
- Yeah!

1218
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,251
- By selling New Yorkers' homes
out from underneath them.

1219
01:19:46,396 --> 01:19:48,261
By selling public housing

1220
01:19:48,398 --> 01:19:49,922
to a Wall Street equity firm.

1221
01:19:50,066 --> 01:19:53,307
I believe the residents of Bolton Village
would have much preferred a tax increase

1222
01:19:53,437 --> 01:19:55,462
to an eviction notice.

1223
01:19:55,605 --> 01:19:58,096
- I'm telling you this, Councilman:
no matter where a New Yorker lives,

1224
01:19:58,241 --> 01:20:01,142
<i>nobody wants a tax increase.</i>

1225
01:20:01,278 --> 01:20:02,609
- Nor do I.

1226
01:20:02,746 --> 01:20:06,443
And I believe it's time that you told
the truth about the Bolton Village deal.

1227
01:20:06,583 --> 01:20:09,950
- Here's the truth:
We have a $3 billion surplus.

1228
01:20:10,086 --> 01:20:14,079
Now, we can use that
to put our people back to work.

1229
01:20:14,224 --> 01:20:17,955
We can use that to bring tax relief to folks.

1230
01:20:18,094 --> 01:20:22,190
That's the truth.
- No, that's not even close to the truth.

1231
01:20:22,332 --> 01:20:24,823
You made a sweetheart deal
with Solstein Donagan to line

1232
01:20:24,968 --> 01:20:26,629
your own pockets.
To buy your way

1233
01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:30,706
out of a deficit that your broken policies
created in the first place.

1234
01:20:30,841 --> 01:20:32,331
<i>The truth of the matter is,</i>

1235
01:20:32,476 --> 01:20:36,435
<i>you continue to lie to the good people
of this city about their intentions.</i>

1236
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:40,346
<i>Solstein Donagan did not buy Bolton Village
to get into the landlord business.</i>

1237
01:20:40,484 --> 01:20:44,045
<i>Solstein Donagan bought Bolton Village
to get into the skyline business.</i>

1238
01:20:44,187 --> 01:20:46,485
Pure and simple.
- Peter, I believe we've gone

1239
01:20:46,623 --> 01:20:50,081
into the area of slander.
- Solstein Donagan, in their 50-year history,

1240
01:20:50,227 --> 01:20:52,821
has never bought a property
intended for residential use,

1241
01:20:52,963 --> 01:20:55,557
and I highly doubt they intend to start now.

1242
01:20:55,699 --> 01:20:58,998
- I don't how much clearer
I can make it for you.

1243
01:20:59,135 --> 01:21:01,000
<i>To the people of Bolton Village,</i>

1244
01:21:01,137 --> 01:21:04,004
<i>there's only one reason I got into this deal.</i>

1245
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:06,040
<i>Because I want better for you.</i>

1246
01:21:06,176 --> 01:21:07,575
There is a new day dawning

1247
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:10,680
<i>in Bolton Village.
And if Solstein Donagan,</i>

1248
01:21:10,814 --> 01:21:14,580
if they step out of line,
if they don't fulfill their promises,

1249
01:21:14,718 --> 01:21:18,210
<i>then I will smack them back into shape.</i>

1250
01:21:18,355 --> 01:21:20,255
<i>That is my oath.</i>

1251
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:22,381
- Well, unfortunately for you, Mayor,
we're all well aware

1252
01:21:22,526 --> 01:21:24,551
what that oath has been worth.
- The fact remains,

1253
01:21:24,694 --> 01:21:26,355
the debt is gone.

1254
01:21:26,496 --> 01:21:28,536
- There are other ways
to move us toward solvency...

1255
01:21:28,565 --> 01:21:30,362
- Name one.
- ... Besides larceny.

1256
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:31,899
I'll tell you

1257
01:21:32,035 --> 01:21:34,635
<i>what I would've done.
First, I would've done something my opponent</i>

1258
01:21:34,738 --> 01:21:37,104
<i>clearly feels is beneath him
and that is to seek</i>

1259
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:39,265
the counsel of my betters
on this crucial issue.

1260
01:21:39,409 --> 01:21:42,378
I would've convened a panel of respected
economists to help us solve this.

1261
01:21:42,512 --> 01:21:44,309
- Respected economists
to have an in-depth look...

1262
01:21:44,447 --> 01:21:46,472
We all know about that panel, Councilman.
- Legality and...

1263
01:21:46,616 --> 01:21:49,346
- That's the same panel
that put us into default in the '80s.

1264
01:21:49,486 --> 01:21:51,977
New Yorkers need more than a panel, son,
they want solutions.

1265
01:21:52,122 --> 01:21:54,852
- New Yorkers want...
- There is only one person up on this stage

1266
01:21:54,991 --> 01:21:56,618
in the business of providing solutions.

1267
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:58,523
The other one up here is in the business

1268
01:21:58,662 --> 01:22:00,943
of saying how dire the situation is...
- Is this a debate,

1269
01:22:01,031 --> 01:22:04,797
<i>or are we being treated
to a Nick Hostetler soliloquy?</i>

1270
01:22:04,935 --> 01:22:06,596
The issue is dire.

1271
01:22:06,736 --> 01:22:09,432
Because you and your cronies
have rigged the game.

1272
01:22:09,573 --> 01:22:13,907
And honest, hardworking New Yorkers
recognize that nothing will change.

1273
01:22:14,044 --> 01:22:17,741
Nothing will ever change
if we continue to elect men like this.

1274
01:22:17,881 --> 01:22:20,008
- Tell me things have not changed!

1275
01:22:20,584 --> 01:22:22,711
When I was elected mayor,

1276
01:22:22,852 --> 01:22:25,446
this was a broken city.
Broken.

1277
01:22:25,589 --> 01:22:28,456
Step by step, I've been getting it fixed.

1278
01:22:28,592 --> 01:22:32,084
Bolton Village
is just another one of those steps.

1279
01:22:32,228 --> 01:22:33,525
Tell me things haven't changed.

1280
01:22:33,663 --> 01:22:37,656
I just stood before you all
and told you we have a $3 billion surplus...

1281
01:22:37,801 --> 01:22:40,326
- Mayor...
- Tell me things haven't changed.

1282
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:42,438
No other mayor
in the history of this great city

1283
01:22:42,572 --> 01:22:45,336
has been able to stand in front of the people
and tell them that!

1284
01:22:45,475 --> 01:22:48,156
When you step out of your house,
in the morning, with your children,

1285
01:22:48,178 --> 01:22:50,908
you take 'em to the parks
of the five boroughs, d'you feel safe?

1286
01:22:51,047 --> 01:22:52,446
Yes, you do,

1287
01:22:52,582 --> 01:22:55,142
'cause I get your letters and I know you do.

1288
01:22:55,285 --> 01:22:57,810
That's us, working together,
getting it fixed.

1289
01:22:57,954 --> 01:22:59,751
Tell me things haven't changed.

1290
01:22:59,889 --> 01:23:02,119
- Yeah!
- That's right, Mayor!

1291
01:23:05,829 --> 01:23:09,458
- Councilman Valliant,
the original question still remains.

1292
01:23:09,599 --> 01:23:12,227
What would you have done
to reverse the debt?

1293
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:15,404
- Tha...
- Don't worry about it, Councilman!

1294
01:23:15,538 --> 01:23:17,506
Nicky fixed it.

1295
01:23:29,653 --> 01:23:31,712
- Two honks for trouble. Got it.

1296
01:23:31,855 --> 01:23:34,153
- Lean your seat back all the way, okay?
- Okay.

1297
01:23:34,290 --> 01:23:35,655
- I'll be right back.

1298
01:24:02,152 --> 01:24:03,551
You know who I am?
- No!

1299
01:24:03,687 --> 01:24:06,087
- 'Cause I know who you are, Todd.
I know what you are,

1300
01:24:06,222 --> 01:24:07,849
you piece of shit!
- What? Watch it! Ah!

1301
01:24:07,991 --> 01:24:09,720
- You set up Andrews to die!
- No. No.

1302
01:24:09,859 --> 01:24:11,579
- You set him up!
You arranged that meeting,

1303
01:24:11,695 --> 01:24:13,526
and you lured him out!
- No, I didn't.

1304
01:24:13,663 --> 01:24:16,393
- You let him walk into an ambush.
- No, I didn't kill him!

1305
01:24:16,533 --> 01:24:19,366
- You want to fuckin' play games with me?!
Shut your fuckin' mouth!

1306
01:24:19,502 --> 01:24:21,783
You're a fucking liar. You're a liar.
- I didn't kill him.

1307
01:24:21,838 --> 01:24:24,204
- Ah... Ah... Ah, no.
- You wanna lie to me?

1308
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:26,103
- I'm not lying.

1309
01:24:26,242 --> 01:24:28,107
He was my friend.
- What?!

1310
01:24:28,244 --> 01:24:30,371
- He was my friend!!
- Get up!

1311
01:24:30,513 --> 01:24:31,707
Now!

1312
01:24:33,183 --> 01:24:36,209
What are you saying?
Tell me what the fuck is going on!

1313
01:24:36,352 --> 01:24:37,751
- Please stop hitting me!

1314
01:24:37,887 --> 01:24:39,650
I didn't know!

1315
01:24:40,724 --> 01:24:42,919
I was just there to give him something!

1316
01:24:43,059 --> 01:24:45,960
I-I was down on the corner
and I was waiting for him,

1317
01:24:46,096 --> 01:24:47,927
and I saw him coming down the stairs

1318
01:24:48,064 --> 01:24:49,588
and I waved, okay?

1319
01:24:49,733 --> 01:24:53,169
I was gonna give him something
to help Valliant win!

1320
01:24:53,303 --> 01:24:56,136
To help Valliant bring down
that sonofabitch Hostetler!

1321
01:24:56,272 --> 01:24:59,070
- That doesn't make any sense, Todd.
Hostetler's your father's friend.

1322
01:24:59,209 --> 01:25:00,733
- Fuck my father!!

1323
01:25:02,112 --> 01:25:04,012
I had the contract in my hand.

1324
01:25:05,181 --> 01:25:08,275
And... Paul, he saw me waving

1325
01:25:08,418 --> 01:25:09,817
and he smiled.

1326
01:25:11,588 --> 01:25:15,922
Murdock, he must've followed me in his car.
And then he got out,

1327
01:25:16,059 --> 01:25:18,994
he shot him, man!
He shot him in the fucking head!

1328
01:25:19,129 --> 01:25:22,929
And then he showed up to work the next day
like nothing had happened.

1329
01:25:23,066 --> 01:25:26,763
- Todd, it's alright. Look at me. Look at me.
Calm down, okay?

1330
01:25:26,970 --> 01:25:29,029
Where's that contract?

1331
01:25:40,216 --> 01:25:41,547
- Take it.

1332
01:25:41,985 --> 01:25:43,782
I don't want it anymore.

1333
01:25:50,627 --> 01:25:53,289
- Are you sure you're ready
to do this to your father?

1334
01:25:53,429 --> 01:25:55,329
- Yeah.

1335
01:25:55,465 --> 01:25:56,989
- Shit.

1336
01:25:57,133 --> 01:25:58,725
Get upstairs. Go!

1337
01:26:33,670 --> 01:26:35,865
That was an accident.

1338
01:26:36,005 --> 01:26:39,532
It's Taggart, alright? Just calm down.
- Motherfucking fuck! Fuck!

1339
01:26:39,676 --> 01:26:42,144
- Ah!

1340
01:27:20,884 --> 01:27:22,317
You okay?

1341
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:24,513
- Yeah.

1342
01:27:25,889 --> 01:27:27,322
Are you okay?

1343
01:27:28,725 --> 01:27:30,522
- Yeah, I'm alright.

1344
01:28:07,931 --> 01:28:10,764
You got those reporters' email addresses?
- Yep.

1345
01:28:11,935 --> 01:28:13,732
Billy, you sure about this?

1346
01:28:14,771 --> 01:28:17,968
- If you don't hear from me in two hours,
you send that email okay?

1347
01:28:18,574 --> 01:28:19,563
- Okay.

1348
01:28:22,946 --> 01:28:25,039
- Thanks for being there, Katy.

1349
01:28:26,950 --> 01:28:28,144
- Every time.

1350
01:28:42,598 --> 01:28:46,261
<i>- Good evening. May I help you?
- Yeah, tell the mayor it's Billy Taggart.</i>

1351
01:28:46,402 --> 01:28:47,960
<i>- One moment, please.</i>

1352
01:29:11,828 --> 01:29:13,193
Mr. Mayor.

1353
01:29:14,430 --> 01:29:15,397
- Billy.

1354
01:29:15,531 --> 01:29:17,055
What a nice surprise.

1355
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:18,827
Thank you, Valerie.

1356
01:29:20,436 --> 01:29:22,802
VCR. I haven't used one in years.

1357
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:26,638
Take your coat?
- No, I'm good.

1358
01:29:27,844 --> 01:29:30,779
- I have to say, Billy,
you're looking a little worse for wear.

1359
01:29:31,447 --> 01:29:33,312
- I got into a bit of a thing.

1360
01:29:34,017 --> 01:29:36,008
- Well, I'm glad you made it out.

1361
01:29:37,453 --> 01:29:39,819
Drink?
- Yeah, make it a double.

1362
01:29:40,456 --> 01:29:42,014
- Atta boy, Billy.

1363
01:29:43,026 --> 01:29:44,220
Alright.

1364
01:29:47,463 --> 01:29:48,657
So...

1365
01:29:49,465 --> 01:29:51,456
...how did Fitzgerald say it?

1366
01:29:52,468 --> 01:29:57,030
"To the orgiastic future that year by year
recedes before us."

1367
01:29:57,673 --> 01:29:58,867
Cheers.

1368
01:30:02,745 --> 01:30:05,737
I don't even know what that means.
- Me neither.

1369
01:30:05,882 --> 01:30:08,874
- What can I do for you, Billy?

1370
01:30:10,486 --> 01:30:12,477
- I wanna know why you hired me.

1371
01:30:13,056 --> 01:30:15,490
- Stick with the adultery narrative.

1372
01:30:15,892 --> 01:30:17,052
It's sexier.

1373
01:30:17,193 --> 01:30:18,922
- Yeah, lies are always sexier.

1374
01:30:19,062 --> 01:30:21,553
Unfortunately, I've had enough this week
to last me a lifetime,

1375
01:30:21,697 --> 01:30:24,029
so why don't you just tell me
the fuckin' truth?

1376
01:30:26,269 --> 01:30:27,930
- The truth is...

1377
01:30:28,071 --> 01:30:29,868
I hired you...

1378
01:30:30,506 --> 01:30:32,064
...to investigate my wife.

1379
01:30:32,208 --> 01:30:33,971
- Investigate her for what?

1380
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:37,079
- For not minding her own business,
is for what.

1381
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,714
For having a big mouth, is for what.

1382
01:30:40,516 --> 01:30:42,916
For asking too many questions, is for what.

1383
01:30:43,052 --> 01:30:45,077
You better be careful
following her example, Billy.

1384
01:30:45,221 --> 01:30:48,088
I might have to hire someone
to investigate you.

1385
01:30:48,224 --> 01:30:50,454
- Who you gonna have do that?
Your boy Murdock?

1386
01:30:50,593 --> 01:30:53,084
I don't think he's available for the job.

1387
01:30:54,297 --> 01:30:57,698
- I hope he didn't suffer.
- No more than Andrews did.

1388
01:30:58,534 --> 01:31:01,765
- Damn shame what happened to that man.
- So tell me this, then, Mayor.

1389
01:31:01,904 --> 01:31:06,364
Did you really think I'd let you turn me
into an accessory to murder? For $50,000?

1390
01:31:06,509 --> 01:31:08,602
What, d'you think
I wouldn't ask any questions?

1391
01:31:08,744 --> 01:31:10,905
Or d'you think I wouldn't get any answers?

1392
01:31:11,547 --> 01:31:14,015
- What answers you got, Billy?
- Oh, I know Andrews

1393
01:31:14,150 --> 01:31:17,608
was about to link you to Bolton Village.
That's the reason you got rid of him.

1394
01:31:17,753 --> 01:31:20,813
- No, sir. Not me.
- Not you.

1395
01:31:20,957 --> 01:31:22,788
The man you hired. Murdock.

1396
01:31:22,925 --> 01:31:25,120
- Try getting that testimony.

1397
01:31:25,261 --> 01:31:27,593
- Yeah. You're good, Mayor.
I give you that.

1398
01:31:27,730 --> 01:31:29,823
You got it all worked out, huh?

1399
01:31:29,966 --> 01:31:32,161
The denial about Bolton Village.

1400
01:31:32,301 --> 01:31:35,293
The discount to Solstein Donagan.
The new big contract

1401
01:31:35,438 --> 01:31:39,101
to the Rochway Group.
Nobody can do a goddamn thing about it, huh?

1402
01:31:39,242 --> 01:31:42,370
'Cause anybody that could is either dead
or you bought 'em.

1403
01:31:42,512 --> 01:31:45,140
I'm fuckin' impressed, Mayor. You're good.

1404
01:31:45,281 --> 01:31:48,148
- Perhaps that's why the people
keep electing me, Billy.

1405
01:31:48,985 --> 01:31:51,545
Because I simply get the job done.

1406
01:31:51,687 --> 01:31:54,520
- So all this, it was all for the city?

1407
01:31:54,657 --> 01:31:56,989
- Everything I do is for this great city.

1408
01:31:57,126 --> 01:32:00,027
- The city doesn't own 50%
of Rochway Group, Mayor.

1409
01:32:00,163 --> 01:32:01,630
You do.

1410
01:32:02,365 --> 01:32:04,299
Look what I got.

1411
01:32:09,372 --> 01:32:11,499
- What you got in your hand?

1412
01:32:11,641 --> 01:32:13,268
- It's your fuckin' jugular, Mayor.

1413
01:32:16,145 --> 01:32:19,171
Fifty percent of $4 billion
is a lot of fucking money.

1414
01:32:20,383 --> 01:32:22,943
So here's how this works.
I got an email in my outbox

1415
01:32:23,085 --> 01:32:25,519
with a scanned copy
of that Rochway contract attached to it.

1416
01:32:25,655 --> 01:32:27,680
I click one button
and 100 different newsmen

1417
01:32:27,823 --> 01:32:29,916
are gonna read your name
alongside Sam Lancaster's

1418
01:32:30,059 --> 01:32:31,492
in black and white.

1419
01:32:31,627 --> 01:32:34,118
Don't worry Mayor,
I got the original nice and safe.

1420
01:32:34,263 --> 01:32:36,754
You resign, you step down,
I'll keep my mouth shut.

1421
01:32:36,899 --> 01:32:39,026
Those emails'll never see the light of day.

1422
01:32:39,168 --> 01:32:41,193
But that Bolton Village deal... is dead.

1423
01:32:41,337 --> 01:32:45,433
Now you wanna tear down
100 other projects as a civilian, so be it.

1424
01:32:45,575 --> 01:32:48,908
But Bolton Village is gonna stand
and you're gonna walk away.

1425
01:32:49,045 --> 01:32:51,411
That's the deal, Mayor.
I suggest you take it.

1426
01:32:51,547 --> 01:32:52,639
- Counteroffer.
- No need.

1427
01:32:52,782 --> 01:32:55,774
I got nothing left for you to threaten.

1428
01:32:55,918 --> 01:32:58,910
- I want the originals,
I want all the copies,

1429
01:32:59,055 --> 01:33:01,080
and I want your case file.

1430
01:33:01,224 --> 01:33:03,215
By... 9 a.m. tomorrow.

1431
01:33:03,359 --> 01:33:04,849
- You're done, motherfucker.

1432
01:33:05,428 --> 01:33:09,194
You are done.
- You ever spend a goddamned minute

1433
01:33:09,332 --> 01:33:11,892
thinking why I chose you, Taggart?

1434
01:33:12,034 --> 01:33:14,059
And I did choose you.

1435
01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:16,667
I chose you.

1436
01:33:18,074 --> 01:33:19,837
Because I own you.

1437
01:33:20,876 --> 01:33:24,243
Now, you'll gonna have to excuse
the quality of the videotape.

1438
01:33:25,248 --> 01:33:28,740
It was shot on one of those camcorders
they used to sell you hot,

1439
01:33:28,884 --> 01:33:30,442
40 bucks on 8th Avenue.

1440
01:33:31,887 --> 01:33:34,355
But I think you're about to see
the big picture.

1441
01:33:35,725 --> 01:33:36,987
<i>- Hey, yo!</i>

1442
01:33:37,126 --> 01:33:39,253
<i>First off, let me say welcome.</i>

1443
01:33:39,395 --> 01:33:42,091
<i>Welcome to Bolton Village.
- What the fuck is this?</i>

1444
01:33:42,231 --> 01:33:43,425
<i>- Ah, what's your name, fool?</i>

1445
01:33:43,566 --> 01:33:46,831
<i>- They call me Alex, but you can call me...
- What the fuck is this?!</i>

1446
01:33:46,969 --> 01:33:48,960
<i>- ... EI Guapo!
- EI Stupid.</i>

1447
01:33:49,105 --> 01:33:52,597
<i>Yo, we just coolin' out,
me and my man David on the camcorder.</i>

1448
01:33:52,742 --> 01:33:54,141
<i>- Hell, yes, the boy David.</i>

1449
01:33:54,277 --> 01:33:56,142
<i>Hello.</i>

1450
01:33:56,279 --> 01:33:58,941
<i>- No, no, wait. I got a pocketful of cash,</i>

1451
01:33:59,081 --> 01:34:03,848
<i>and we looking to have some fun tonight.
So we gonna hit up the usual spots,</i>

1452
01:34:03,986 --> 01:34:06,045
<i>maybe get into something unusual.
- Hell yeah.</i>

1453
01:34:06,188 --> 01:34:08,952
<i>Drop the gun, Mikey!
Drop the fucking gun!</i>

1454
01:34:08,991 --> 01:34:11,960
<i>- What the fuck?!
- Drop the fucking gun!</i>

1455
01:34:12,094 --> 01:34:14,775
<i>- Yo, chill, man! What the fuck?
- Mikey, we just wanna talk.</i>

1456
01:34:25,141 --> 01:34:27,905
<i>Drop the fucking gun.
- Man, what the fuck, man?</i>

1457
01:34:28,044 --> 01:34:30,239
<i>- It's okay, Mikey. We just wanna talk.</i>

1458
01:34:34,517 --> 01:34:37,247
<i>- Oh, shit, man!
C'mon, get the fuck outta here!</i>

1459
01:34:51,467 --> 01:34:54,163
<i>Oh, shit, man!
C'mon, get the fuck out of here!</i>

1460
01:34:58,774 --> 01:35:00,935
- How's your memory now, Billy?

1461
01:35:05,181 --> 01:35:07,775
Now, there's something
that your average citizen...

1462
01:35:10,386 --> 01:35:12,183
...just wouldn't understand.

1463
01:35:13,356 --> 01:35:14,789
But I do.

1464
01:35:16,359 --> 01:35:18,190
You see, we...

1465
01:35:18,327 --> 01:35:20,454
we take because we can.

1466
01:35:21,364 --> 01:35:22,797
We take...

1467
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:25,792
...because it feels good.

1468
01:35:27,336 --> 01:35:29,804
The only difference between you and I...

1469
01:35:30,573 --> 01:35:33,098
...is that you've gone and done it
on videotape.

1470
01:35:33,242 --> 01:35:35,540
Like I was saying, I want the original,

1471
01:35:35,678 --> 01:35:39,205
all the copies and the case file,
by the morning.

1472
01:35:39,815 --> 01:35:41,373
You can have this copy.

1473
01:35:41,817 --> 01:35:45,378
I transferred it to disk... seven years ago.

1474
01:35:56,031 --> 01:35:57,225
- Nat?

1475
01:37:09,472 --> 01:37:12,669
<i>- We take... because it feels good.</i>

1476
01:37:13,676 --> 01:37:16,304
<i>The only difference between you and I</i>

1477
01:37:16,445 --> 01:37:19,312
<i>is that you've gone and done it on videotape.</i>

1478
01:37:20,449 --> 01:37:23,009
<i>Like I was saying, I want the original,</i>

1479
01:37:23,152 --> 01:37:26,417
<i>all the copies and the case file,
by the morning.</i>

1480
01:37:27,122 --> 01:37:29,181
<i>You can have this copy.</i>

1481
01:37:29,325 --> 01:37:32,590
<i>I transferred it to disk... seven years ago.</i>

1482
01:37:36,131 --> 01:37:39,123
- He'll ruin you if you do this.
You know that, Billy.

1483
01:37:39,502 --> 01:37:40,935
- Use it.

1484
01:37:41,837 --> 01:37:43,638
- There's no statute of limitations
on murder.

1485
01:37:43,672 --> 01:37:46,664
If I go with this,
I gotta go with the whole thing.

1486
01:37:46,809 --> 01:37:49,175
Can't cut it down to protect you.
- Not asking you to.

1487
01:37:53,949 --> 01:37:55,416
- You sure?

1488
01:37:55,551 --> 01:37:57,712
- Time to square the debt.

1489
01:38:01,323 --> 01:38:04,759
He was very charming, indeed, yes.

1490
01:38:04,894 --> 01:38:06,885
- Ahem. Ladies and gentlemen,

1491
01:38:07,029 --> 01:38:10,590
unaccustomed as I am to public speaking,
I know you, Sam, you like a debate.

1492
01:38:10,733 --> 01:38:13,031
How did you enjoy that one?
- Masterful.

1493
01:38:13,168 --> 01:38:14,969
- Thank you very, very much.

1494
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:17,803
Uh, firstly,
I'd like to thank you all for coming.

1495
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:22,843
This is a room full of my wife and I's
very, very good friends, so thank you.

1496
01:38:22,978 --> 01:38:26,414
A man much smarter than me once said
that politics...

1497
01:38:26,549 --> 01:38:28,847
is the art of the possible.

1498
01:38:28,984 --> 01:38:32,977
Now, this afternoon,
Jack Valliant was ordering stationery.

1499
01:38:33,756 --> 01:38:36,850
Tonight, he's looking for the number
of the bus that hit him.

1500
01:38:36,992 --> 01:38:39,222
He fought a good fight,
but he was boxing shadows.

1501
01:38:39,361 --> 01:38:42,057
<i>He was like Roberto Duran out there.
"No mas, Nicky, no mas.</i>

1502
01:38:42,197 --> 01:38:44,893
Don't hit me no more."
- Mr. Mayor. He says it's urgent.

1503
01:38:45,034 --> 01:38:47,628
- Thank... I'll deal with this.
I... I apol... Don't go anywhere.

1504
01:38:47,770 --> 01:38:49,635
I have a lot of people to thank.

1505
01:38:49,772 --> 01:38:51,262
<i>Yes.
- It's me.</i>

1506
01:38:51,407 --> 01:38:54,137
- Billy.
I didn't think you'd call me so soon.

1507
01:38:54,276 --> 01:38:57,074
<i>- Look out your window now, Mayor.
It's your future.</i>

1508
01:38:57,212 --> 01:38:59,009
- I think your ride's here, Nick.

1509
01:39:05,588 --> 01:39:09,422
- Nicholas Hostetler, you're under arrest
for the murder of Paul Andrews.

1510
01:39:09,558 --> 01:39:11,082
What?

1511
01:39:11,226 --> 01:39:14,662
- You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used

1512
01:39:14,797 --> 01:39:17,595
against you in a court of law.
- Will be used against you, Carl.

1513
01:39:17,733 --> 01:39:19,257
- You have the right to an attorney.

1514
01:39:19,401 --> 01:39:21,892
If you cannot afford one,
one will be provided to you.

1515
01:39:22,037 --> 01:39:25,097
- Attorneys? They'll be pulling
your dental records once I'm done with you.

1516
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:26,639
- Do you understand these rights

1517
01:39:26,775 --> 01:39:29,107
as I have described them to you?
- I understand you're suicidal.

1518
01:39:29,244 --> 01:39:31,872
You may have forgotten
how you got your job; I have not.

1519
01:39:32,448 --> 01:39:36,714
Do you really think a jury of my peers
in New York City will convict me?

1520
01:39:37,052 --> 01:39:39,247
- I'm just the handcuffs guy.

1521
01:39:42,057 --> 01:39:45,049
- Don't wait up, dear.
- Have I ever?

1522
01:39:50,265 --> 01:39:52,233
- I guess we both misjudged Billy, Mayor.

1523
01:39:52,368 --> 01:39:54,700
Then again, you misjudged the lot of us.

1524
01:39:54,837 --> 01:39:56,737
You thought Billy would roll over,

1525
01:39:56,872 --> 01:39:59,500
you thought Andrews
was sleeping with your wife.

1526
01:39:59,642 --> 01:40:01,269
You thought I wasn't.

1527
01:40:02,645 --> 01:40:04,909
- Mr. Mayor!

1528
01:40:06,081 --> 01:40:08,641
Why did you do it?

1529
01:40:17,660 --> 01:40:19,855
What does this mean for the election?!

1530
01:40:33,509 --> 01:40:37,206
<i>- Councilman, New Yorkers have been put
through quite an ordeal these last few days,</i>

1531
01:40:37,346 --> 01:40:39,974
<i>beginning with the murder of Paul Andrews,
your campaign manager,</i>

1532
01:40:40,115 --> 01:40:42,015
<i>and culminating last night with the arrest</i>

1533
01:40:42,151 --> 01:40:43,778
<i>of Mayor Hostetler
in connection with that crime.</i>

1534
01:40:43,919 --> 01:40:45,853
<i>What do you have to say to New Yorkers</i>

1535
01:40:45,988 --> 01:40:49,515
<i>who quite frankly have lost faith
in their government?</i>

1536
01:40:49,692 --> 01:40:52,991
<i>- Well, days like these
can definitely shake your faith...</i>

1537
01:40:53,128 --> 01:40:56,188
- Rachel, you stayin' out of trouble?
- Hey... Trying.

1538
01:40:56,331 --> 01:40:57,696
- Yeah, I know it.

1539
01:41:00,536 --> 01:41:02,128
Whatever he's drinking.

1540
01:41:09,545 --> 01:41:11,536
Tomorrow's the big day, huh, Billy?

1541
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:14,945
<i>... believed that whenever
there's a sliver of a choice...</i>

1542
01:41:15,084 --> 01:41:17,348
- Looks like our guy's a lock.

1543
01:41:22,925 --> 01:41:24,654
To Jack Valliant.

1544
01:41:27,730 --> 01:41:29,459
<i>A good man.
- ... We need every ounce</i>

1545
01:41:29,598 --> 01:41:32,726
<i>that we can muster
to repair the damage that's been done.</i>

1546
01:41:43,746 --> 01:41:46,943
- I, uh... I got you... this.

1547
01:41:47,716 --> 01:41:51,516
- What is it?
- What does it look like? It's a phone card.

1548
01:41:55,958 --> 01:41:57,391
- Thank you.

1549
01:41:58,393 --> 01:41:59,951
- Every time, Billy.

1550
01:42:08,237 --> 01:42:10,967
- It's okay, Katy. I'll be home real soon.

1551
01:42:11,774 --> 01:42:13,435
- I'll be here.

1552
01:42:13,575 --> 01:42:14,974
- C'mon, Billy.

1553
01:42:15,778 --> 01:42:17,769
We'll take the long way.
