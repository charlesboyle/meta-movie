00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:14,800
</font> This is awesome.<font color="#808080"> </font> Oh, my God.

2
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,886
</font> Oh, my God. This is crazy.

3
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,327
</font> Oh, my God! So incredible.

4
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,841
Do you want to know a secret?
I took a Viagra.

5
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,921
What? This is awesome!

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,525
Why aren't I using
this every day?

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,683
What'd you do? Wait.
Stop, stop, stop.

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,886
Stop. What?

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,520
What's the matter?

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,840
"What's the matter?"

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,207
You just took a Viagra
to have sex with me.

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,123
I thought it would
make it better.

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,120
It was better.
It takes some of the pressure off.

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,045
Because you can't get
hard without a Viagra?

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,884
Is it because you
don't think I'm sexy?

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,450
I thought you'd think it was fun

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,125
for me to super-size
it for once.

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,764
That is the worst birthday present
you could ever give someone.

19
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,725
I was just trying to go
turbo for your birthday.

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,644
My hard-ons are still in analog.
This shit's digital.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,287
I don't want a turbo penis.

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,961
I like your medium-soft one.

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,683
Look, I can get it up.
Just not that far up.

24
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,043
Come on. You were liking it.
Forget it. Forget it.

25
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,485
Debbie, come on.

26
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,201
All right, you know what?
I'll be honest with you.

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,284
Lately, my penis hasn't been getting
as hard as it used to, all right?

28
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,930
And it's kind of freaked me out.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,721
I don't know whether or not it's because I'm
getting older or I'm losing testosterone.

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,050
No, it's what I told you.
Your artery to your heart is clogged

31
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,170
because you eat so much junk food,
and you have high cholesterol,

32
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,481
and that is directly related
to your penis vein.

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,524
My "penis vein"?
Where'd you get my penis vein?

34
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,728
There was a whole
Dr. Oz about it.

35
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,849
Cholesterol is not
clogging my penis vein.

36
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,322
Maybe I can't get
a hard-on fully

37
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,811
because, you know, I keep my
phone in my front pocket,

38
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,480
and it's radiating my balls.
I'll give you that. That makes sense.

39
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,251
Where'd you even get it from?

40
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,605
<i>A very safe and
reputable farmacia.</i>

41
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,684
Mexico? Mexico.

42
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,526
Look at this.
You want that to go to waste?

43
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,046
Looks like a plant
trying to reach the sun.

44
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,883
Okay, well...

45
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,326
I'll do it for 10 minutes,

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,802
but you have to figure out what
to do with the other four hours.

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,209
Stop it. Dad, stop.

48
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,841
<font color="#D900D9">I love you.

49
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,441
Time to get up.

50
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,607
Your breath smells weird.

51
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,761
Wake up.

52
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,764
I really need you to wake up.

53
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,721
Wake up. Come on.

54
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,090
Time to wake up. Okay.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,161
Whoo!

56
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,765
</font> Ready!

57
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,641
</font> Make a wish!

58
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,641
<i>Hello, Sayid.</i>

59
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,886
<i>Can I watch Lost?</i>

60
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,244
You can't handle Lost.

61
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,886
It's too violent, and
you won't understand.

62
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,009
If I don't understand it,
why can't I handle it?

63
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,081
Because you're eight.

64
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,607
<i>I can handle it.
I've seen a shark eat a guy on Shark Week.</i>

65
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,841
<i>Shark Week is fake.</i>

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,411
No, it's not.

67
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,404
All of it is reenactments.

68
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,521
I know, but they...

69
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,923
And that's scary.
You shouldn't be allowed to watch that.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,005
They show the reenactments,
but they actually happened.

71
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,730
It's gonna give you nightmares.

72
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,009
I can handle a nightmare.
You're a nightmare every day for me.

73
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,441
Hey.

74
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,051
Don't eat that cupcake.

75
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,121
What?

76
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,725
The one you just
put into the sink.

77
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,491
I saw you were hiding that.

78
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,840
This cupcake? You think I'm
going to eat this cupcake?

79
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,564
Yeah. I so don't want this cupcake.
Look.

80
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,489
You're still going to eat it.
I'm going to eat that cupcake?

81
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,925
Just put it in the trash.

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,480
What would you like to do?
Your choice.

83
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,529
Anything? Yeah, anything.

84
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,563
Just hang out with you guys.

85
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,042
Don't you want to get a
massage, or do something fun?

86
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,726
Forty's huge.

87
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,801
I'm turning 38.

88
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,770
Okay, 38. We will move on.

89
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,562
Isn't it weird that our
birthday is the same week,

90
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,563
and then we're going to have a
party, and it's just for me?

91
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,529
No, I don't think
it's weird at all.

92
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,808
Because you're turning
40 and I'm turning 38.

93
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,962
Come on, do you really want
to be one of those ladies

94
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,560
who's just so insecure
about their age?

95
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,080
And they lie, and then they gotta
remember, and it gets all...

96
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,403
You don't get it.
See, you don't understand how it works.

97
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,967
I don't want to shop
at old ladies' stores.

98
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,761
I don't want to go to J.
Jill and Chico's, and Ann Taylor Loft.

99
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,285
I'm not ready yet.

100
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,771
I need two more years.

101
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,525
That is so insane, it
kind of makes sense.

102
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,090
What'd you get me
for my birthday?

103
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,321
Wait a minute, I
thought you said that

104
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,323
we shouldn't get each
other gifts this year.

105
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,771
What do you mean?

106
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,600
You're supposed to get
me a surprise gift.

107
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,245
This is a big birthday.

108
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,290
I'm turning 40.

109
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,925
</font> Mom!

110
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,369
Mom, why can't I
get new clothes?

111
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,206
<font color="#D900D9"></font> What the fuck? Nothing fits me!

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,128
God damn it!

113
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,281
I'm going to go work out, I'll
be back in about an hour.

114
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,961
Hey, did your father call to
wish you a happy birthday?

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,729
No, but that's no surprise.

116
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,441
Come on. Coming.

117
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,443
You got to keep up with us, sweetheart.
Yeah, I'm in.

118
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,726
That's why your body
looks like your body

119
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,120
and her body looks
like her body.

120
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,766
Before, after. Before, after.

121
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,130
You guys just go on without me.
I'm just gonna...

122
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,770
I think I gotta...

123
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,161
Fuck.

124
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,130
Thanks for letting
me join this team.

125
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,247
It's not really a team.

126
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,890
It's just a bunch of guys
that get together and ride.

127
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,080
I know, I know.<font color="#808080"> </font> Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

128
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,807
Hey! Bike lane, asshole!

129
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,202
It's always the guy in
the fucking Infiniti.

130
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,845
Good. See, you're getting
tight here. Yeah.

131
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,924
This, we need to work on. Okay.

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,082
So, why on earth is Pete taking Viagra?
What's going on?

133
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,366
I don't know.

134
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,370
I think maybe he isn't attracted
to me anymore or something.

135
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,169
I don't know.
Well, that is ridiculous.

136
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,681
If you were my girlfriend,
I would not need a Viagra.

137
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,684
I would need an
anti-Viagra pill...

138
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,610
To try not to get a boner.

139
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,769
But everyone gives you a boner.

140
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,044
Don't sell yourself
short like that.

141
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,685
You give me a boner.

142
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,080
Barb doesn't give me a boner.

143
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,769
Maybe things are
just getting stale.

144
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,971
That's why if maybe I
work out really hard...

145
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,249
Maybe he'll be able
to get a boner again.

146
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,609
Why do you need
to have sex, Deb?

147
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,842
Sex is the number one
thing people fight about.

148
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,449
You stop having sex, there
will be no more fights.

149
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,760
I am living proof.

150
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,167
I have no sex,

151
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,204
and I am the happiest
I have ever been.

152
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,769
I knew it.
I knew you were not having sex.

153
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,251
I can see it on your face.

154
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,970
It's all...

155
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,570
Puckered and pained.

156
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,570
I'm enjoying our non-sex
period, that's all I'm saying.

157
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,801
Don't you miss it?

158
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,201
I wouldn't know, because I don't
have any feeling down there anymore.

159
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,566
I have nerve damage
from my C-section,

160
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,360
so everything's just kind of...</font>

161
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,965
She's numb down there.

162
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,162
I could sit down hard
on a fire hydrant,

163
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,165
and I wouldn't even know
that I was sitting.

164
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,643
I could get stung by a hornet down
there, and I would not feel it.

165
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,769
You could put anything in there,

166
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,600
and I would not know
what the object was.

167
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,649
I used to pee in a nice stream,

168
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,041
and now it just kind of
goes like a shower head.

169
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,884
That is the saddest
thing I've ever heard.

170
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,368
I think you need a family.
Don't you want a family?

171
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,406
No, I think I want
to Clooney it.

172
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,205
Clooney it? Yup.

173
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,406
He doesn't seem happy.

174
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,161
Yeah, he is.

175
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,810
No, he's lonely.

176
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,967
No, he's not.

177
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,884
See, I think he has sad eyes.

178
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,122
You sweet little thing, no.

179
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,409
He's doing sad, lonely
eyes to get the next lady.

180
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,642
Look, I can do it, too. Watch.

181
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,848
I bet George Clooney
is really lonely.

182
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,968
Just him and his pig.

183
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,849
You'd fuck him. I wouldn't.

184
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,046
So would you. I would.

185
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,360
I wouldn't feel it, but I would.

186
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,480
You'd fuck him with your numb vagina.
Yes, you would.

187
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,804
Ocean's Thirteen Inches,
that's what you'd find out. <font color="#D900D9"></font>

188
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,927
Do you think?

189
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,450
I mean, that was idiotic, though.
You have to understand that.

190
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,204
That's the one thing
you don't do,

191
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,442
is tell her that
you used Viagra.

192
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,329
I think that's even
on the warning label.

193
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,922
We're in one of
those phases where

194
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,448
everything that the
other person says

195
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,409
just annoys the shit
out of each other.

196
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,290
All the time. It's a blast.
Don't worry about it.

197
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,044
You just gotta ride that out.

198
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,811
This sounds terrible.

199
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,484
Okay, I like it.

200
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,840
But...

201
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,403
Do you ever wonder what
it would be like if, say,

202
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,083
you were separated
by something bigger.

203
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,685
Like death? Like her death?

204
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,243
I have given it a fair
amount of thought.

205
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,888
Not in a painful way, just
quietly slid into death.

206
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,166
Like a gas leak.

207
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,049
Absolutely.
It's gotta be peaceful.

208
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,009
I mean, this is the
mother of your children.

209
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,770
You want her to die...

210
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,166
No, I'd want it to
be a peaceful...

211
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,526
...gentle, you know.

212
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,491
Yeah, just like drift into a coma
from which she never awakens.

213
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,449
And then you move on.
Then you are a widower.

214
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,808
That's just it,
people love widowers.

215
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,682
They love widowers. It's like the
polar opposite of divorced guys.

216
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,761
It's the best.

217
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,569
It's like, "Oh,
that poor widower."

218
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,364
"If I could only
make him happy."

219
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,962
"Somehow, ease his pain."

220
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,042
"Cock-suck away his sadness."

221
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,326
Do you know that this song,
Pixies did this song,

222
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,404
<i>it's about a Salvador Dali short
film called Un Chien Andalusia.</i>

223
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,209
This music doesn't
make people happy.

224
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,523
<i>This song kicks off Doolittle, one of
the best albums of the last 30 years.</i>

225
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,090
Look how angry you get
while listening to it.

226
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,491
An important record.

227
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,131
It's my birthday.
You don't control the radio on my birthday.

228
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,801
I do.</font>

229
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,009
I control the radio
on my birthday.

230
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,244
Sadie's watching Lost.

231
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,130
Sadie, how many times have
you watched Lost this week?

232
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,721
I only watched 11. But I have eight
more, and then I'm done, so...

233
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,689
How many are there? 114.

234
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,727
Are you kidding me?

235
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,690
You can't watch over 100 episodes
of a show in five weeks.

236
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,046
It'll melt your brain.

237
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,769
It's not melting my brain,
it's blowing my mind.

238
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,564
</font>That's really bad, Sadie.

239
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,563
You're not allowed to do that.

240
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,451
My relationship with Lost
is not your business.

241
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,851
It's extremely personal.

242
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,880
Stop!

243
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,969
Stop it. Be nice to your sister.

244
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,361
You guys are going to
cherish each other one day.

245
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,962
Stop it! Stop!

246
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,964
</font> It's your birthday.
You don't need to go to the store.

247
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,203
No, just five minutes.
Desi and Jodi are fighting.

248
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,530
All right, five minutes, but
then I'm pulling you out.

249
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,486
Hi.

250
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,721
Hi.

251
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,643
How's Jodi treating you?

252
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,126
Jodi?

253
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,049
Oh, Jodi's my new BFF.

254
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,451
She's like a little kitty-cat.

255
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,205
Sometimes she comes and
rubs up against my leg.

256
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,209
And you're a ball of shit.

257
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,851
She loves me.

258
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,166
Huh.

259
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,163
Can you do inventory so that
we can do the sidewalk sale?

260
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,641
And you really need to pay
attention to the numbers

261
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,725
because we have $12,000
unaccounted for.

262
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,047
I think it's probably Desi.

263
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,240
She's been having a really hard
time using these simple computers.

264
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,566
It's because she's stupid.

265
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,330
I think she might be stealing.

266
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,523
She's not stealing.

267
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,764
She's our best employee.
She made nine grand last month.

268
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,330
How much did I make?

269
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,641
You brought in $2,200.

270
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,807
That's not bad.

271
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,129
Well, it's not that good.

272
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,091
I mean, I'm not comparing you,
but you're not as good.

273
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,729
All right. See you.

274
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,564
I don't think she's
wearing underwear.

275
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,567
What? It's all dark up there.

276
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,168
Why are you looking?

277
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,771
I didn't mean to look.

278
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,844
I just said, "Hey, whoa
." And there it was.

279
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,808
Maybe she's wearing
dark underwear.

280
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,882
Yeah, maybe she has underwear that has
a picture of a vagina painted on it.

281
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,241
Stop looking.

282
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,847
Some deep oranges and browns,
and maybe some dark greens.

283
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,524
That would really play
up your features.

284
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,524
I'll just take out my AmEx and you
pick what stuff you think's good.

285
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,367
Whoo!

286
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,649
Good job!

287
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,801
Whoo!

288
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,167
Where's Daddy?

289
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,844
I think he went to poop.

290
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,331
Pete!

291
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,807
</font> Q-A-T. Suck on that, bitch.

292
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,448
Hey. What are you doing?

293
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,290
Going to the bathroom.

294
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,008
We're all downstairs,
waiting for you.

295
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,851
You've been up here for
a really long time now.

296
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,841
I'm almost done.
I'll be down in a second.

297
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,402
Charlotte just did her first
flip on the trampoline

298
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,561
and she landed on her feet.

299
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,840
She was really proud of herself.

300
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,169
That's great! And you missed it.

301
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,609
She'll do it again.

302
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,280
It's the fourth time you've
gone to the bathroom today.

303
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,881
Give me a break.

304
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,607
Why is your instinct to escape?

305
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,364
It's not my instinct
to escape from you.

306
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,169
It is my instinct to
come into the bathroom

307
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,890
when I need to go
to the bathroom.

308
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,048
You want me to hook up cable
in here or something?

309
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,201
You need DirecTV?

310
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,486
Well, it's probably too
late for this dump,

311
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,369
but if you could do that for
the next one, I'd be psyched.

312
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,080
How come I don't smell anything?

313
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,925
It's because I shoved an Altoid
up my ass before I came in here.

314
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,206
Let me see, then.

315
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,845
What? Let me see.

316
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,126
No, I'm not going
to let you see.

317
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,247
You're not going to let me see,

318
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,321
because you're not
taking a poop.

319
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,169
I've been flushing as I go.

320
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,651
You're flushing as you go.

321
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,968
Who takes a half-hour
to go to the bathroom?

322
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,246
John Goodman.

323
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,561
Don't press "Enter." I'm not
sure I want to make that move!

324
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,400
<i></font> Thank you. Wow.</i>

325
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,724
<i>You know, when I first
started this label,</i>

326
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,770
<i>my dream was to work
with musicians and bands</i>

327
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,081
<i>whose music I just
admired so much.</i>

328
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,648
<i>The person that I thought, "My God,
wouldn't it be incredible to work with,"</i>

329
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,767
<i>was Graham Parker.</i>

330
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,445
<i>Tonight, we have him, solo</i>

331
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,683
<i>because we couldn't afford
to fly in The Rumour.</i>

332
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,325
<i>Graham Parker.</i>

333
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,005
</font> It's just not my kind of music.

334
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,411
</font> Really?
What is your kind of music?

335
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,801
I like happy music
that you can dance to.

336
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,086
Yeah, but when you
listen to a song

337
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,322
where somebody's singing
about something depressing,

338
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,971
don't you relate to it? No.

339
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,963
It makes you feel
the same as they...

340
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,930
It makes you feel you're a
part of the human race.

341
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,365
I don't feel like that.

342
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,566
I like Lady Gaga.

343
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,608
Oh, God, of course you do.

344
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,409
What? Shallow dance music.

345
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,166
It's not. It is fun.

346
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,244
And it's about release
and sex and power.

347
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,563
You don't have to like it.
It's really not for you, that's fine.

348
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,291
This is a job.
This is not a hobby.

349
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,170
Can't you love him,
just as a hobby

350
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,401
and sign a 15-year-old
hot girl so we can eat?

351
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,324
Graham Parker & The
Rumour had two albums

352
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,370
<i>in the Rolling Stone Top 500
Best Albums of All Time.</i>

353
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,441
Two of them.

354
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,089
If I can just sell 10,000 records
to his hardcore fanbase,

355
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,207
we're golden.

356
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,167
The last of Graham
Parker's fans just died.

357
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,722
I do know. Hardly.
That sort of music depresses people.

358
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,245
Hi, Charlotte.

359
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,130
Sadie. Sadie, what are
you listening to?

360
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,844
Okay. This is music that
makes people happy.

361
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,369
And this is what people buy.

362
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,086
What?

363
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,970
Right, girls?

364
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,050
Come on, Sadie.

365
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,449
Okay.</font>

366
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,091
Why did you take it off?

367
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,163
Now, something
that really rocks.

368
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,124
This is called good music.

369
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,045
From somebody's heart.

370
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,963
This is bumming me out.
This isn't fun.

371
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,011
Just listen to these words, okay?
Just listen to the words.

372
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,487
I don't understand the words.

373
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,200
This is lyrics. This is poetry.

374
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,046
This is what is going to
survive in a hundred years.

375
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,282
It just doesn't
make people happy.

376
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,484
Makes me happy.
I can dance to it.

377
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,043
But you're the only one
in the room who's happy.

378
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,650
Sometimes I wish just
one of you had a dick.

379
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,242
Well, we don't want one.

380
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,042
Is there something that you can
do to be helping me right now?

381
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,248
Yeah, I'm ready to help.
Just tell me what to do.

382
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,688
Can you go get a lunch
box or something?

383
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,921
For me or for them?

384
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,281
Charlotte! I've got a test!

385
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,004
I'm coming, I'm coming.

386
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,881
Charlotte, I'm
going to kill you!</font>

387
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,966
Hi, Debbie.

388
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,326
Hi. Any day now, huh?

389
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,209
Not really. Three months, still.

390
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,806
Hi. Hi.

391
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,281
Katie's dying for a play date.
Let's hook these two up.

392
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,601
That would be great.
Okay, I'll call you. Great.

393
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,801
Okay, great.

394
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,847
No.

395
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,160
No, what? No.

396
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,810
What? No.

397
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,921
She's sweet.

398
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,365
She's evil.

399
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,524
Hello. Hi. Hi.

400
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,968
Listen, Charlotte really
needs to get here on time

401
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,040
because she needs the extra
time to just settle in.

402
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,003
Oh. We are on time.

403
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,248
Being on time means being early.

404
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,881
Okay.

405
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,561
It's nice to see you in class.
We'd like to see more of you.

406
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,530
I come to...

407
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,401
Hi, Debbie.

408
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,527
Grandma Molly.

409
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,531
How are you?
I'm so happy about the science fair.

410
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,841
Thank you for coming.
It's going very well, I heard.

411
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,400
Yeah. I love you.
You look so beautiful!

412
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,605
Happy birthday.
I just learned that you're 40.

413
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,011
Are you 40?

414
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,761
Yeah.

415
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,766
I remember when I was
40, and then I blinked,

416
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,330
and there I was, going to be 90.

417
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,681
My God, where did it go?

418
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,924
One day, you're going to blink
and you're going to be 90.

419
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,288
And I won't be around to see it,
and that makes me very sad.

420
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,088
I'm telling you.
I'm warning you.

421
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,922
Don't blink. Don't blink.</font>

422
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,203
<i></font> <font color="#D900D9"></font> And then you missed

426
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,164
Oh, God. I can't tell Debbie.

427
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,401
<i>You've got to tell her, Pete.</i>

428
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,245
I mean, she knows it's bad, but
she has no idea just how bad.

429

<i>If you sell the house, it'll

430
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,481
No, Debbie's not really
into selling the house.

00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,131
<i>As your business manager and your
friend, I can't recommend that.</i>

432
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,042
<i>Hey, how funny would it be
if I bought your house?</i>

433
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,327
Okay. Bye.

434
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,845
<i>Hang in there.</i>

435
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,043
<i></font> From the retro
label, Unfiltered,</i>

436
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,284
<i>comes the first Graham Parker &
The Rumour record in 30 years.</i>

437
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,202
<i>When we play together, the
magic was just ridiculous.</i>

438
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,521
<i>And I think what we've
got is just so great.</i>

439
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,481
What are you doing?

440
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,171
I'm contextualizing him as one of
the great figures in rock history.

441
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,450
You can't show him
in his prime in '77,

442
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,205
and then jump straight
to him as he is now.

443
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,520
It's terrifying.

444
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,802
You have got to reverse it.
You have got to show him

445
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,090
as he is now, very briefly,
and then show him in 1977.

446
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,565
<i>You have got to
Benjamin Button it.</i>

447
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,451
I don't know what you're talking about.
All rock stars are older now.

448
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,126
Steven Tyler, David
Bowie, Mick Jagger...

449
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,361
Paul McCartney. Okay. Stop it.

450
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,683
Everybody that you are mentioning
looks like an old woman now.

451
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,367
You're just mentioning a
bunch of Jessica Tandys.

452
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,690
Keith Richards
gets away with it.

453
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,963
But that's because Keith Richards
looked 70 when he was 40.

454
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,646
And now that he's
70, he looks 69.

455
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,766
He's regenerating.

456
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,769
I like it, and I think
Graham Parker's sexy.

457
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,201
Well, would you fuck him?

458
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,890
Yes. You'd...

459
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,883
You'd fuck him and
you won't fuck me?

460
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,685
I mean, I kind of
fucked you once,

461
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,722
if you could have finished.
Oh. I finished.

462
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,724
Okay, enough of who fucked
who and who finished what.

463
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,080
I finished.

464
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,405
Look, it's a retro label.
That's our niche, that's our market.

465
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,324
It costs money to break new bands.
I can't do that.

466
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,721
Okay, and also, you're the guy
who turned down Arcade Fire.

467
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,325
Everybody turned
down Arcade Fire.

468
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,811
It's crazy.
There's so many of them.

469
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,251
We don't have the money
to market a new band.

470
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,325
We just need to make
Graham seem relevant.

471
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,921
Who's he talking to?

472
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,206
<i>The Jewish Journal.</i>

473
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,164
<i>The Jewish Journal?</i>

474
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,768
Apparently, old Jews are the only ones
who still buy hard copy of records.

475
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,809
Because they don't like
to download music.

476
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,320
Because they don't know
what "downloading" means.

477
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,250
Why is this album different
from any other album?

478
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,081
It isn't.

479
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,401
What is he wearing?

480
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,125
It's a hat with the
Oreo logo on it.

481
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,324
Why? I don't think
he's being ironic.

482
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,801
I think he just
really likes Oreos.

483
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,600
Look, Paul Westerberg
record did okay.

484
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,130
Frank Black record
did all right.

485
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,645
The Haircut One
Hundred, not so much.

486
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,166
We have to break this record.
Otherwise, we're not here next year.

487
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,084
He's coming, he's coming.
Oreo Man is coming.

488
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,286
Hey, guys, how are you?

489
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,361
Good, man.

490
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,169
Aren't cookies the best? Yeah.

491
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,086
<i>Jewish Journal guy
loves the record.</i>

492
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,207
Great!

493
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,647
Got a bit of a problem, though.
A touch of gout.

494
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,327
Gout?

495
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,966
My whole family,
they all had gout.

496
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,691
Jesus. That's very unfortunate.

497
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,923
My auntie Queenie, she
had a foot like this.

498
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,924
It's like a size of a small pig.
I've got a photo of it.

499
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,526
I'd love to see that
photo of that gout foot.

500
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,250
And a couple of bunions as well.

501
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,367
Fuck.

502
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,965
I've got to go to
the podiatrist,

503
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,644
and I hope he can shoot
me up with something.

504
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,166
Yeah, well, let's get
you to the podiatrist.

505
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,084
Bye, Graham.
See you later, Graham.

506
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,566
Good luck with your gout.

507
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,005
Rock and roll, baby.

508
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,366
The happiest period in people's
lives is from age 40 to 60.

509
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,603
So, this is it.
We're in it right now.

510
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,404
It's true. Says who?

511
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,165
Says a lot of people.
Most people say that. Oh!

512
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,280
We have everything we need right
now to be completely happy.

513
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,560
We're going to blink, and be 90.
What?

514
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,211
So, let's just
choose to be happy.

515
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,090
Yeah. Yeah.

516
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,400
Your eyes are kind
of glazing over.

517
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,084
No, I'm processing it all.

518
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,560
Some of these, I wrote for you.

519
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,609
So, we have to exercise every day.
Mmm.

520
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,489
Spend more time alone together.

521
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,682
And we have to go to the
therapist, every week.

522
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,211
It's a little pricey.

523
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,045
No stressing over tiny things.

524
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,961
Yeah, that's good.
You should do that. Mm-hmm.

525
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,963
We have to get more
involved in school.

526
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,244
Yeah. Have more
patience with the kids.

527
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,209
And we need to
work on our anger.

528
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,761
Yeah, I think it would be good if
you could take care of your anger.

529
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,126
No, I said both of us.

530
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,361
That's what I said. Our anger.

531
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,121
Okay, and no more smoking.

532
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,521
Yeah, you gotta cut that out.

533
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,321
I don't want to make this about a fight.
I want to just be positive.

534
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,041
Yeah. Sorry.

535
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,044
Okay, and then no more
holding onto resentments.

536
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,168
We have to just let that go.

537
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,890
So, you're saying that
if we're arguing,

538
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,690
and I apologize,
you'll let it go?

539
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,280
And not throw it back
in my face later?

540
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,404
Well, I don't do that,

541
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,166
but I will continue
not to do that.

542
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,566
And what did you write?

543
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,723
All of that. That's plenty.
That's a lot.

544
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,321
And you're going to eat better?

545
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,528
Oh, yeah.
I've been doing a decent job.

546
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,161
But I don't think
there's anything wrong

547
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,730
with having some fries
every now and again.

548
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,285
And then I'll smoke that day.

549
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,728
That's not the same thing.
It is the same thing.

550
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,927
I like fries.

551
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,243
And the other thing
is your dad's stuff,

552
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,642
the not letting him
guilt-trip you all the time

553
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,724
because that puts a lot of
pressure on you, and stress,

554
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,524
and then the whole
family feels it.</font>

555
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,807
And he is a grown man, and
he's not our responsibility.

556
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,363
And you're not giving him
money anymore, right?

557
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,450
No. No, I haven't been
giving him money.

558
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,160
I haven't done that for years.
I told you.

559
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,446
Can you please put that down?

560
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,524
A lot of people are RSVP-ing
to your birthday party.

561
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,364
You sure you don't want to just
do a joint birthday party?

562
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,441
No.

563
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,726
We always used to. No.

564
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,485
Did Jodi tell you she
thinks Desi's stealing?

565
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,360
Are you serious?

566
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,761
How much? $12,000.

567
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,806
Oh, God.

568
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,047
And Desi's taking it?

569
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,281
Well, I don't know.

570
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,686
That's what Jodi said.

571
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,730
We really need the
store to work.

572
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,485
It is.

573
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,609
Don't put that kind
of pressure on me.

574
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,443
No, no. It's not what I mean.
I'm just...

575
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,484
Are you nervous about money?

576
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,245
Are we okay?

577
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,049
Yeah. All right.

578
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,923
Maybe we just suck it up
because she's clearly

579
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,401
earning so much more than
any other employee we have.

580
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,682
Oh, yeah, for sure.
We can't fire her.

581
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,763
We're barely breaking
even with her.

582
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,080
That's why we have to keep her.

583
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,367
Look at this.
She's making out with somebody.

584
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,010
Is she screwing him?

585
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,044
</font> That might be like a dry hump.

586
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,282
</font> Look at the position
of her skirt.

587
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,769
That's too grainy
to know for sure.

588
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,489
Oh, my God. This is in the middle of the day.
Customers could be in there.

589
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,925
At least she's getting some.

590
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,209
What did you say?
"At least she's getting some"?

591
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,771
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Yes.

592
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,286
What are you talking about?
We had sex the other night.

593
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,725
You gotta give me a
little credit for that.

594
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,969
It's not about credit.
It's about...

595
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,963
We need to have more passion.

596
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,321
Like this.

597
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,166
That's not passionate.

598
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,924
It looks passionate to me.

599
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,201
What?

600
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,887
What is she doing? <font color="#D900D9"></font> Okay.

601
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,007
Oh, my God.

602
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,806
Oh, my God. Oh, my gosh.

603
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,521
Don't do that. What am I doing?

604
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,483
Don't fart in the bed.

605
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,284
I'm not. It's the springs.

606
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,084
This is why we never have sex.

607
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,202
That's disgusting, you're gross.

608
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,805
I don't know what
you're talking about.

609
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,490
<font color="#D900D9">You're so...

610
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,800
God!

611
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,721
<i><font color="#D900D9"></font> Sadie, Sadie, Sadie,
Sadie, Sadie</i>

612
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,525
Charlotte, I'm
doing my homework.

613
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,051
Okay, watch this. Watch this.

614
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,130
There's a haunted cow back here.

615
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,569
I'm pretty sure it
does not have milk.

616
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,160
Moo.

617
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,410
Moo!

618
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,322
See that? They took me away.

619
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,365
You're no fun.
You never want to play.

620
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,850
Charlotte, how many times
do I have to tell you?

621
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,968
<i><font color="#D900D9"></font> Sadie, Sadie, Sadie</i>

622
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,282
<i>Sadie is boring</i>

623
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,768
You're so mean since
your body got weird.

624
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,851
Close the door.

625
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,524
You're no fun.

626
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,002
If you can just move
just a little bit more.

627
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,605
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Oh, shit.

628
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,841
Ah!

629
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,526
Ow. Ow.

630
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,766
No, my boob is in there!

631
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,769
Did I tell you that my
son's going to Stanford?

632
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,049
No, that's great.
Great for us, and great for him.

633
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,201
Cough again. Great school.

634
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,361
Everything looks good.

635
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,442
Your face is close to my face.

636
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,689
Descending colon.

637
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,445
I'm about four
feet in right now.

638
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,647
That's what he said.</font>

639
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,289
Just try to breathe
through your nose.

640
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,128
That's your mouth.
Breathe through your nose.

641
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,731
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Are you all right?

642
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,209
Are you a grinder?
Do you grind your teeth?

643
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,203
I grind all night.

644
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,805
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Oh!

645
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,880
I think we need to
turn the gas down.

646
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,206
Turn it up!

647
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,760
No, we're going to turn it down.

648
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,290
Turn it up!

649
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,369
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Ooh!

650
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,001
Do you have to breathe
right on my neck?

651
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,246
Sorry.

652
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,490
What are you all
doing for Christmas?

653
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,840
Um, I don't know.

654
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,322
You have a tree and everything?
Mm-hmm.

655
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,687
Isn't that fun? In the spirit?

656
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,285
Sorry, I just had
one quick question.

657
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,846
On your form, you said
you were born in 1974,

658
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,049
but your paper, it said '72.
So I just need to know which it is.

659
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,326
It's 1974.

660
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,969
Oh, wait.
Because on your last form,

661
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,202
you said that you
were born in 1975.

662
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,091
Didn't you tell me you
were born in 1976?

663
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,208
No. <font color="#D900D9"></font> That's funny.

664
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,528
So, you want to go with 1974?

665
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,202
I'm not gonna "go with" 1974.
It is 1974. <font color="#D900D9"></font>

666
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,881
Okay.

667
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,606
Just remember to write
"1974" every time.

668
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,209
It's okay. It's 1976.

669
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,769
I lie about my age, okay?

670
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,083
Okay. Okay? Okay? Okay?

671
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,770
Okay. Okay.

672
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,561
You're tightening up.

673
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,051
Oh, my gosh.

674
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,684
I know how old you are
by counting the rings. <font color="#D900D9"></font>

675
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,250
A little gyno joke.

676
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,001
Oh, my God. Please.

677
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,451
What are you doing?

678
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,322
Getting ready to go for my ride.

679
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,526
You want a blowjob?

680
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,523
Yeah. Why?

681
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,086
I really want a
cigarette right now.</font>

682
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,730
Wow, happy to help.

683
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,248
Charlotte, where is my backpack?

684
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,090
</font> Hello?

685
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,926
Mom's busy!

686
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,650
Why are you locking the door?

687
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,571
Mom, what's going on in there?

688
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,210
Mom, I can't be late for school.
I have a test.

689
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,406
</font> Mommy can't talk right now!

690
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,881
</font> This isn't funny, Mom.
I need to go!

691
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,610
Mom, let me in! Please!

692
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,205
That's not gonna help!

693
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,328
</font> Put on your shoes.
We'll meet you in the car.

694
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,205
Ow. Sadie hurt me! I didn't!

695
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,725
So, hit her back!

696
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,881
She's faking.

697
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,764
I'm not!<font color="#808080"> </font> Go downstairs!

698
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,880
Please! Sadie gave me a...

699
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,689
Stop crying! Stop crying!

700
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,046
Stop it! God damn it!

701
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,722
</font> Quit killing each other!
Mom, please come out.

702
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,569
Shut up! Stop it!

703
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,768
Open the door!<font color="#808080"> </font> Go away!

704
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,963
Open it up! Please!

705
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,121
Forget it.

706
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,965
No, don't forget it, don't forget it.
Don't, don't...

707
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,088
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Oh, God.

708
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,648
Hey, boychik!

709
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,567
Hey!

710
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,451
It's the 11:00 from London.

711
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,491
Drop something
valuable, you shit!

712
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,891
<i>How you doing?
How are you, bubeleh?</i>

713
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,361
That's loud.
Every eight minutes, buddy.

714
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,442
You look pretty good.
Your hair is different.

715
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,011
Yeah, I'm growing it out.

716
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,726
I'd get it cut.

717
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,120
Daddy, you never play with me.

718
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,204
I do, but right now,
look who I'm talking to.

719
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,682
Hi. It's your brother!

720
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,724
Hi. You don't look
like my brother.

721
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,600
I told you, honey, that's
because of the egg donor.

722
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,081
Remember?
I came from a test tube!

723
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,202
How's business? It's not good.

724
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,164
Nobody wants curtains.

725
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,410
They think of it like a luxury.
It's not a luxury.

726
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,927
You need shade.
You need privacy.

727
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,041
Who wants to have other
people watch you fuck?

728
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,248
<font color="#D900D9">I know how you feel.

729
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,687
My business is going through
some growing pains right now.

730
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,807
Daddy! Daddy!

731
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,082
Don’t jump on Daddy.
Be careful, don’t jump on Daddy!

732
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,200
Remember, Daddy has
high blood what?

733
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,691
<font color="#D900D9"></font> High blood pressure.

734
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,564
That's right. My daddy's old.

735
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,563
Can you go outside without
me for a little bit?

736
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,127
Yeah.
Don't go near that little pool!

737
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,605
All right?
We're going to pee in the pool.

738
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,206
Do The Three Stooges routine
you were practicing.

739
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,484
I can't tell them apart.

740
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,291
I swear to God, I need tattoos.

741
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,444
Look, I wanted to
talk to you about

742
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,282
scaling back a little bit.

743
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,481
You know, Deb and I are...
We're thinking about selling the house.

744
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,330
I think that house is
more than you need.

745
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,926
I think it was too big of a
purchase when you made it.

746
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,968
Yeah. In the meantime, I'm going
to have to make some changes.

747
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,120
I'm going to have to cut back.

748
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,521
I understand. What do you mean?

749
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,370
With you. Oh.

750
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,527
I'm sorry. What?

751
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,642
I can't lend you any more money.

752
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,441
No, that's a bad idea.
That's not the way to cut back.

753
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,529
I have three children here.

754
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,842
What about Claire?
Can't she get a job?

755
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,803
Claire takes care
of your brothers!

756
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,206
What do you want her to do?

757
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,328
If she goes to work, then
I gotta hire somebody!

758
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,606
Well, you've got to
figure something out

759
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,569
because I can't do it.
I can't do it.

760
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,241
Okay, fine.
Why don't we kill them?

761
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,721
Come on, we'll kill two of them.

762
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,245
I'll keep the best one.

763
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,129
Really, it'll save us
both a lot of trouble.

764
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,725
Come on. Line up!

765
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,928
Line up for murder! Come on!

766
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,969
Who wants to be killed? I do!

767
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,408
Okay, we're eliminating one already.
We're cheaper. You're gone.

768
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,050
</font> Murder me. Okay. Boom. Dead!

769
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,770
I'm dead! You're dead!
You're dead!

770
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,769
Kill me, kill me!
All right, the kids are murdered.

771
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,080
That will save us some money.
Daddy is the best!

772
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,084
Why would you have
three kids, anyway?

773
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,003
I mean, you're 60 years old.
You have no money.

774
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,361
Because Claire wanted a baby.

775
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,888
If we didn't at least try,
she would have left me.

776
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,407
She was 45 years old.
Nobody thought it would take.

777
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,687
The doctor, when we're doing in
vitro, is winking at me like...

778
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,370
"Don't worry, don't worry."

779
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,760
We were very unlucky.

780
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,888
And now, we have these
three beautiful children.

781
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,050
Come on.
I gotta tell you something.

782
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,201
What?

783
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,530
Your mother wanted you aborted.

784
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,880
Oh. Jesus Christ.

785
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,928
No, no. It's the truth.

786
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,602
You know, it was the '70s.
We were 22 years old.

787
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,406
That's what everybody did.
You did some blow, had sex, had an abortion.

788
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,006
Really? Yes.

789
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,003
We were on the way to
the doctor's office.

790
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,765
I said, "Let's stop, have
a pizza, talk about it."

791
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,730
"If you still wanna do it
after lunch, it's okay."

792
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,922
The pizza saved your life.

793
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,402
But don't give me money,
because I'm not worth it.

794
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,371
So, how much do I owe
you for saving my life?

795
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,125
I don't have a number.
You just keep giving like you're giving.

796
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,167
Hey. Oh, hi, Pete.

797
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,321
Hey. Hey.

798
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,561
Why aren't you playing
with the kids?

799
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,404
We were playing all
day with them.

800
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,565
Pete is just talking to me
about his 40th birthday party.

801
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,170
Whatever I can do to help.

802
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,571
Okay. Did you feed them?

803
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,210
I fed half of one.

804
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,611
Half of...

805
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,688
Let's go, we'll feed them.
Mommy will feed them.

806
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,287
Who wants tuna with
a side of jet fuel?

807
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,605
Hi, I'm looking for my dad.
I mean, an older man.

808
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,126
So, how's Sony treating Pete?

809
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,330
He's not with Sony anymore.
He went out on his own.

810
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,765
Now he's able to
focus on the artists

811
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,644
that he's really
passionate about.

812
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,921
Hmm.

813
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,600
How's Sadie doing?

814
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,002
The last time I saw her, she was
throwing her Cheerios on the floor.

815
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,445
<font color="#D900D9"></font> What a mess.

816
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,806
Right.

817
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,485
She just got her period.

818
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,001
Well, I guess she's not
a little baby anymore.

819
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,969
It would be nice to see
more of each other.

820
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,920
Well, we can certainly arrange for that.
I'd love to see the girls.

821
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,765
That would be nice.
Mm-hmm. It would.

822
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,449
Do you have a day that is better...
A good day?

823
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,160
I would say the weekends,
but our weekends are hell.

824
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,244
Soccer competitions,
kids' exams.

825
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,561
Right, right.
I mean, we're both so busy.

826
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,247
I have young children,
you have young children.

827
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,961
I don't think we should judge
ourselves too harshly about that.

828
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,965
I know, I wasn't...
I didn't say anything.

829
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,170
No, I'm glad we're here.
I think this is a good start.

830
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,801
And then, we can spend more
time together, it'd be nice.

831
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,286
It'd be nice.

832
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,610
Do you want to see
pictures of the kids?

833
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,365
Oh. Yeah.

834
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,725
This is Kel, my son.

835
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,962
He's handsome. He's 13? Mm-hmm.

836
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,285
And that's Alexandra, my daughter.
She's a real perfectionist.

837
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,324
A lot like you.

838
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,689
That's the whole gang at Cabo.

839
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,249
Excuse me, dear, I gotta
go to the restroom.

840
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,364
Be right back. Okay.

841
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,690
Daddy and I are
making some changes

842
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,762
so that we can be
happier and healthier.

843
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,171
And we're starting with
this meal that I prepared.

844
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,522
I think it looks great.
Doesn't it look good?

845
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,800
What is that, grilled cheeses?

846
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,248
No, baked tofu. Oh.

847
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,005
It's actually really tasty.

848
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,321
And the lettuce is
so fresh and tasty

849
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,847
that you forget how good
lettuce tastes on its own,

850
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,410
without dressing.

851
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,649
No, dressing always gets in the way
of the natural taste of the lettuce.

852
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,848
And another thing we've decided

853
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,562
is to cut back on all of
the electronics we use.

854
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,451
Basically, what we're going to
do, is get rid of the Wi-Fi

855
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,369
and only use the computer...

856
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,522
What?
...from 8:00 to 8:30 at night.

857
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,000
How are we gonna go
on the computer?

858
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,407
We're gonna have a hard
line in the kitchen.

859
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,084
Yeah. We'll supervise that.

860
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,845
You can't do this.
You can't take away the Wi-Fi.

861
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,287
No Wi-Fi! A-ha-ha.

862
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,089
You don't spend enough
time with the family

863
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,051
when you're constantly on your
iPhone and your computer.

864
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,567
And, you know, you're only
here for five more years.

865
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,483
So, you won't see me
after five years?

866
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,961
No, but you won't
be living with us.

867
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,841
And you should get to
know your little sister.

868
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,809
</font> You've got the perfect
friend, right here.

869
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,769
I don't wanna be
friends with her now.

870
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,128
I'll be friends with her when
she's 20 and a normal person.

871
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,931
I don't wanna hang out with
her when I'm in my 20s.

872
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,365
You're on the computer
too much as it is.

873
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,250
You need to get outside more,
do some playing outside.

874
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,245
Yeah, you could build things.
You could build a fort outside.

875
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,607
What? Yeah, build a fort.

876
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,091
Play with your
friends and have...

877
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,891
Make a fort? Outside?

878
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,287
And do what?

879
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,169
Do what in the fort?

880
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,450
When I was a kid, we used to build
tree houses and play with sticks.

881
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,127
Nobody plays with sticks.

882
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,886
You and Charlotte can
have a lemonade stand.

883
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,201
Play kick the can.

884
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,725
Look for dead bodies.

885
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,365
It's fun. That's fun to do.

886
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,120
Get a tire and then just take a stick
and run down a street with it.

887
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,885
Nobody does that crap.
It's 2012.

888
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,490
You don't need technology.

889
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,210
No technology!

890
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,367
Charlotte, put that down.

891
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,650
I don't need to be monitored
all the time on the computer.

892
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,091
I don't do anything bad.

893
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,491
Nobody said you were bad.

894
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,130
I don't do things I'm
not supposed to.

895
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,884
I don't illegally
download music.

896
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,803
I don't look at porn like Wendy.

897
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,964
She is up to no good.
She's not allowed to come over here anymore.

898
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,041
What's porn?

899
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,167
No, she said "corn."

900
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,561
This isn't turning out
the way I wanted it to.

901
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,721
I'm not hungry.

902
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,009
No computer. Listen to your mom.

903
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,565
I need to use it
for my homework.

904
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,051
She's outplaying us.

905
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,201
I know. She's tough.

906
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,602
</font> This is the best
birthday present.

907
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,727
</font> It's good to get away.

908
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,404
We haven't been to Laguna
without the kids in years.

909
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,482
I know.
If we're happy, they're happy.

910
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,688
Yeah, I mean, I can't take it.

911
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,962
With the hormones,
and the crying.

912
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,849
Jesus. And "do my homework."

913
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,081
Them's lil' bitches.

914
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,687
Them's lil' bitches.
Bugging us for shit all the time.

915
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,001
And they never
appreciate anything.

916
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,004
No! God, no.
They're selfish assholes.

917
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,683
Aw, I feel bad. I love them.

918
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,807
I know.

919
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,491
</font> I miss them already.
Should we go home?

920
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,046
</font> Nah.

921
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,766
Why do we fight?

922
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,205
I don't know, it makes no sense.

923
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,520
It makes no sense.

924
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,410
When we get in a fight,

925
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,563
look at my eyes and let's
remember this moment, right now,

926
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,210
and know that we
never have to fight.

927
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,409
But you're such a
dick sometimes.

928
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,845
I know, I am a dick sometimes.

929
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,248
People think I'm so nice,
but I'm such a dick.

930
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,643
Thank you for admitting that.

931
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,486
And you get so mad at me, I
feel like you want to kill me.

932
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,284
I do want to kill you.

933
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,681
How would you do it?

934
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,842
I don't know. I'd poison you.

935
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,966
I'd poison your cupcakes that you
pretend not to eat every day.

936
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,850
And just put enough in to
just slowly weaken you.

937
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,921
I love it.

938
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I would enjoy our last few
months together. Me too.

939
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,601
Because you'd be
so weak and sweet.

940
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,523
And I could take care of you...

941
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,966
But while killing you.

942
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,083
See, you know what
I love about us?

943
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,605
You can still surprise me.

944
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,809
I figured, for sure, you'd knock me
out with one fell swoop of poison.

945
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,201
But you would extend it
over a series of months.

946
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,125
Have you ever thought
about killing me?

947
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,247
Oh, yeah. Really?

948
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,321
Sure.

949
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,721
How would you do it?
Wood chipper.

950
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,285
A wood chipper? Yeah.

951
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,441
A wood chipper.

952
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,646
Yeah.

953
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,801
Wow.

954
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,211
<i>I know. Did you see Fargo?</i>

955
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,327
Yeah.

956
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,041
Ugh.

957
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,124
That's a bad plan.
The cupcakes is a way better plan.

958
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,406
It is. You're right.

959
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,209
You know what?
I won't murder you.

960
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,566
Aw!

961
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,480
I love you.

962
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,041
I love you, too.

963
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,280
Do you know what I brought?
What?

964
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,886
A medical marijuana cookie.
Ben gave it to me last Christmas.

965
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,121
What?

966
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,207
Yeah. I brought it. You did?

967
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,327
Chocolate chip kooky.

968
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,401
Should we do it?

969
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,450
Let's eat the cookie and then we'll
order a bunch of cheeseburgers.

970
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,284
Let's order the entire
room service menu.

971
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,847
Just get all of it.
You deserve it, you really do.

972
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,530
Wouldn't you rather
have me around

973
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,683
for less years and I'm incredibly
happy, than longer and miserable?

974
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,680
Yes, and I just realized
that right now.

975
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,921
Go get the cookie.
I'm getting the cookie.

976
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,445
Go get the cookie.

977
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,766
Ow!

978
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,600
Should we watch porn
when we eat the cookie?

979
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,090
Yeah.
Should we get a block of porn?

980
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,447
I don't think we need
24 hours of porn.

981
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,081
But you know, two porns costs just
about as much as a 24-hour block.

982
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,771
I think that's too much porn.

983
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,482
We don't have to watch it all, but
for the value, it makes sense.

984
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,680
How much are we supposed to eat?

985
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,802
I don't know.
I think six or seven cookies, right?

986
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,600
Plus, it's old, it probably
has lost some of its...

987
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,364
Potency.

988
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,762
We should have sex more.

989
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,888
I mean, girls have it so easy.

990
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,362
You just show up with your sexual
organs and you're good to go.

991
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,680
All the pressure is on the guy.

992
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,761
It's true.

993
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,810
And I look at guys...
Like, I look at a guy like Prince,

994
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,211
and you know that guy fucks.

995
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,281
Yeah.

996
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,721
I know I don't fuck like Prince.
Uh-uh.

997
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,086
Prince can fuck. Uh-huh.

998
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,884
I fuck like David Schwimmer.

999
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,331
You do.

1000
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,326
<i>You know, I fuck like
Ross from Friends.</i>

1001
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,971
Mmm.

1002
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,080
Looks good.

1003
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,486
How does he do it?

1004
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,642
The floating spoon.

1005
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,008
Check it out.
It's my dick and balls.

1006
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,165
Oh, my God.
I don't eat my own dick.

1007
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,046
I ate my dick!

1008
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,729
Kelly, I think this
room has rodents.

1009
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,086
There! Just saw it.

1010
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,363
Have you seen my starfish?

1011
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,848
Where did I put my starfish?

1012
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,001
My God.

1013
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,891
I'm gonna deep
throat this éclair.

1014
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,480
I wanna make out
with you so bad.

1015
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,522
I felt like I was gonna choke!

1016
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,884
That was nice.

1017
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,202
Mom, Charlotte's crying

1018
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,884
because she's got an
ear infection again.

1019
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,930
</font> I didn't know what to do.

1020
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,920
We're home.

1021
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,844
Are you okay?</font>

1022
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,286
What's the matter?

1023
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,325
I wanna rip my ear off,
it hurts so much.

1024
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,923
I told you that pediatrician didn't
know what he was talking about.

1025
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,088
Come on, you can't blame
it on our doctor.

1026
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,761
Ear infections are
common in little kids.

1027
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,241
Not in kids over six years old.

1028
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,561
We're going to the
Eastern doctor.

1029
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:04,080
If she's in this much pain, then
we should call a real doctor.

1030
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,645
Are you kidding right now?

1031
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,882
I know. Okay. Yup.

1032
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,280
What we should do
is easy and simple.

1033
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,921
No more dairy, no more
wheat, no more sugar.

1034
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,368
Sugar, wheat and dairy.
Okay. Yeah.

1035
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,045
What the fuck is left?

1036
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,281
Sorry.

1037
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,848
Isn't everything sugar,
wheat, and dairy?

1038
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,889
She can have
vegetables and fruits.

1039
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,880
<font color="#D900D9">Oh, but she can eat fruits.

1040
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,291
Fruits. Yeah.

1041
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,680
Any kind of fruit?

1042
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,160
Mangos, pineapple.

1043
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,645
It isn't, there are safe fruits

1044
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,762
and then there are unsafe fruits?
No, no.

1045
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,206
What about French fries?

1046
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,970
Could we do something like that?
Are you okay?

1047
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,009
Would you like to come on the table?
I'm okay, I'm...

1048
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,486
Why don't you go on the table?

1049
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,721
</font> I don't wanna go on the table.

1050
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,040
No. It looks like you
need to get on the table.

1051
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,360
I don't wanna get on the table.

1052
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,650
Pete!

1053
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,291
</font> God damn it.

1054
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,201
What are you doing?

1055
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,330
I need you to look at something.
In my butt.

1056
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,201
Why?

1057
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,009
I think I got
something in there,

1058
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,964
and I'm not limber
enough to see.

1059
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,202
I need you to look
at it, all right?

1060
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,530
I think I might have an anal fissure, or
a hemorrhoid, or a worm or something.

1061
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,925
What are you doing
with your phone?

1062
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,040
I'm trying to take pictures of it so I
can compare it to something on Google.

1063
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:37,162
Can we just keep just a
small shred of mystery

1064
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,727
in our relationship, please?

1065
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,968
Look, I saw you have
two babies, okay?

1066
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,685
Seriously, I need you
to get up all in that.

1067
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,451
I do not want to
investigate your anus.

1068
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,610
Payback time.

1069
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,201
It's a hemorrhoid.

1070
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,360
Thank you.

1071
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,882
Now, erase that
from your memory.

1072
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,642
Where'd she get those clothes?
Those are expensive clothes.

1073
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,528
Think. Where do you think?

1074
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,201
I don't want this
to sound harsh,

1075
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,320
but everything that comes
out of her mouth is a lie.

1076
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,647
Everything that goes
into it is a dick.

1077
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,564
Everything that
goes in is dicks?

1078
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:28,961
A dick.

1079
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,241
Don't say that.

1080
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,643
I'm sorry. I'm just being
protective of the store.

1081
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,804
I'm going to go talk to her.

1082
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,726
Hey, Desi.

1083
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,041
Hi. Hi.

1084
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,169
Is that your new
Acura out front?

1085
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,681
Uh, yeah.

1086
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,921
It's so nice.

1087
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,126
Do you love it?

1088
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,369
I mean, it's not a fucking
Porsche, but it'll do for now.

1089
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,086
Huh.

1090
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,931
Hey, Desi, would
you mind wearing

1091
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,801
some of the clothes that
we have in the store?

1092
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,888
Yes. Yeah, I'm sorry.

1093
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,446
Will that be okay? Yeah.

1094
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,207
Perfect.

1095
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,691
Good?

1096
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,008
You know, I actually
made this one myself.

1097
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,366
Did you? Yeah.

1098
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,611
The tiger, I did it on a
piece of paper separately,

1099
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,564
and then I actually transferred
it to the T-shirt.

1100
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,801
Wow.

1101
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,004
So, you stenciled on the tiger?

1102
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,003
I drew it on a piece
of paper and then

1103
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,646
I transferred the
drawing to the T-shirt.

1104
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,129
You have an amazing body.

1105
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,406
Really?

1106
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,960
Yes. Are those real?

1107
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,404
My boobs? Yeah.

1108
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,968
Yeah. Do you wanna touch them?

1109
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,286
Really?

1110
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,686
Touch them.

1111
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,961
Okay.

1112
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,171
Wow.

1113
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,761
Huh.

1114
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,486
Jesus.

1115
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,244
I mean, they really are amazing.
That's firm, for real.

1116
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,401
They're like a memory mattress.

1117
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,203
It's, wow, like
Tempur-Pedic, you know?

1118
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,324
They look amazing.

1119
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,967
My kids just sucked the
meat right out of mine.

1120
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,446
No. Yeah.

1121
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,601
There's some meat in there.

1122
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,691
My boobs are just gone.
Since I had kids, my boobs are just gone.

1123
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,525
They didn't even say goodbye, you know?
They just left.

1124
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,282
<i>By the time I'm 40, these are gonna
go National Geographic on me.</i>

1125
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,480
I feel bad about
myself right now.

1126
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,566
<i></font> I think this is a really
good offer on the house.</i>

1127
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,284
We expected more.

1128
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,885
I know it's a bad market,

1129
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,042
but that's still way under
what we were looking for.

1130
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:38,727
<i>I know, but based on what the market's
like, it's like you're gaining money,</i>

1131
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,680
<i>because it's so much more
than what you deserve.</i>

1132
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,560
<i>But these people are from Iran</i>

1133
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,967
<i>and they don't really know that
they're offering too much.</i>

1134
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,725
<i>Is there any chance that
Debbie will go for it?</i>

1135
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,684
I doubt it.
I mean, I don't know.

1136
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,609
<i>There's a lot of
inventory out there.</i>

1137
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,563
<i>I mean, what is her problem?</i>

1138
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,485
She has unrealistic
expectations.

1139
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,324
I'm faster than you!

1140
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,930
We're Jewish!

1141
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:04,483
Hey! Did you miss me, Travis?

1142
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,763
It's Jack.

1143
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,526
Hey, Jack.

1144
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,086
</font> My daddy doesn't know my name!</font>

1145
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,440
</font> Okay, come on, let's go.

1146
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,569
Can I go show them my

1147
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,761
</font> Yeah, really quick.

1148
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,082
It's all right with me.
Elevator down!

1149
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,403
Okay.
Go play with your tiny uncles.

1150
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,360
</font> Let's play murder!
<font color="#808080"> </font> Yeah. Let's go.

1151
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,164
So, what are you doing?
Spring cleaning?

1152
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:29,928
I'm getting rid of everything in the
house that has gluten or sugar.

1153
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,765
Why? What's wrong with gluten?

1154
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,171
Gluten's really bad for you.

1155
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,886
I don't think so. It's wheat.

1156
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,201
Don't you watch Dr. Oz?

1157
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,646
As in, "The Wizard of"?

1158
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,289
Hey, Mom, we were wondering if we
can use the computer to iChat?

1159
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,682
Remember the rules?
8:00 to 8:30.

1160
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,445
Yeah, but I have a friend over.

1161
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,570
Hi, Wendy. Yeah, I know.

1162
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,961
Why don't you guys go play?
You could go build a fort!

1163
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,411
</font>Hey, remember the Alamo?

1164
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,010
Have you ever built
a fort, Wendy?

1165
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,281
Like, on Facebook?

1166
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,922
I will take this if you're
gonna throw it away,

1167
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,287
because at our house,
we're wheat-eaters.

1168
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,640
But don't you want to live long
enough to see your kids grow up?

1169
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,451
That's up to God, honey.

1170
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,688
No, but that's really
not good for the kids.

1171
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,928
Eh, the kids eat
grass, this is fine.

1172
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,891
Wendy's mom lets her go
on whenever she wants.

1173
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,610
Yeah, my mom's
pretty cool about it

1174
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,444
as long as I finish my homework.

1175
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:17,921
Yeah.

1176
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,884
Well, I guess I'm
not the cool one,

1177
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,440
but the rules are just
different in our house.

1178
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,922
Well, I get better
grades than Wendy.

1179
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,048
She does. She's so smart.

1180
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,891
Let me just grab
the candy worms.

1181
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,491
See, your rules are ridiculous.

1182
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:31,847
Don't sass me.

1183
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,170
I'm only sassing you because you're
throwing out all the food in our house

1184
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,890
and I'm freaking starving.

1185
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,081
You're being stupid.

1186
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,004
Wendy, could you go stand
in the other room, please?

1187
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,366
Yeah. Mom.

1188
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,646
Give me your iPhone, now.

1189
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,171
The nougat things are good.

1190
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,160
I have all my contacts in there.

1191
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,084
Okay, if you don't give
me your phone right now,

1192
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,600
then I'm gonna have to take away
your phone and your computer.

1193
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,768
Jesus Christ, I need my
computer to do homework.

1194
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,524
That's it.
No phone, no computer.

1195
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,727
This is B.S.

1196
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,565
This is a bunch of F-ing S.
You're acting like a B.

1197
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,644
Kids! Time to go!

1198
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,524
You go to your room, right now.

1199
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,046
You are not allowed to use

1200
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,803
iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch,
iTunes, Netflix,

1201
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,843
Pandora, or Spotify.

1202
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:14,130
She's a little pip,
just like her mommy.

1203
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:18,170
So, I might have a job tomorrow.

1204
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,406
At least, I'm gonna go
try to give an estimate.

1205
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,440
Do you mind taking the kids
for a couple of hours?

1206
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,201
Um...

1207
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,361
Okay.

1208
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,045
This is nice.

1209
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,362
You and I don't spend enough
time together, do we?

1210
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,451
We spend enough time together.

1211
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,721
We do?

1212
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,009
It's quality time.

1213
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,645
Then we do.

1214
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,565
I'll go with what you think.

1215
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,323
</font>What else did they say?

1216
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,244
All right, some kid
named Joseph...

1217
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,970
I know Joseph. You do?

1218
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,764
He's making a "hot-or-not" list.

1219
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,281
What?

1220
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,681
Sadie said, "That's so lame and
immature that you're doing that."

1221
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:58,651
And then Joseph says, "Yo, girl,
we're just having some fun."

1222
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,410
"So don't be a bitch, yo."

1223
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,884
That is not nice.

1224
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,089
So then Sadie said,
"Don't call me a bitch."

1225
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,650
And Joseph said, "I
didn't call you a bitch."

1226
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,330
"I said don't act like a bitch."

1227
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,482
"And by the way, you're
in the 'Not-Hot' column."

1228
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,048
Who made him the judge of "hot"?

1229
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,280
Do you realize what that
could do to her self-esteem?

1230
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,768
What a little fuckhead.
I'll kill him.

1231
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,161
Then Sadie said, "You're
in the jackass column."

1232
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,049
"I gotta go, I'm bored of you."

1233
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,086
That is cool.
That's taking the high road.

1234
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,645
And then, for some reason,

1235
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,803
there's an emoticon of a
panda doing push-ups.

1236
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,445
I wonder what that means.

1237
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,487
I don't think it means anything.
I think it's just adorable.

1238
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,166
Aww.

1239
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,606
Well, she's a good girl.

1240
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,451
She was polite and she
stood up for herself.

1241
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,250
That's pretty cool.</font>

1242
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,887
What?

1243
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,121
Shit. What?

1244
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,481
I thought she was coming in.

1245
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,284
Oh, my God, that
scared me to death.

1246
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,010
If she caught us,
she would kill us.

1247
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,451
She would. She would kill us.

1248
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,801
Huh.

1249
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,806
I gotta make a call.

1250
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,041
We sold how many?

1251
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,169
<i></font> 612 album downloads.</i>

1252
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,767
Wait a minute.
There are no zeroes after that?

1253
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:15,481
<i>There are zeroes, but all
of them are before 612.</i>

1254
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,886
<i>There are none after.</i>

1255
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,491
How is that even possible?

1256
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,006
<i>Well, out of 300
million Americans,</i>

1257
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:25,051
<i>612 people chose to
download the album.</i>

1258
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:28,243
<i>You could personally call
everyone who bought this record.</i>

1259
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,761
We're fucked, we're fucked.

1260
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,561
Here's the deal, I want you to
meet me tomorrow morning at 8:00.

1261
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,002
I want a list of at least 30 ideas
of what we can do to change this.

1262
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,411
We have to change this.

1263
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:41,251
I started a record label
because I couldn't get a job,

1264
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,687
so I have no other options.</font>

1265
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,126
What financial problems?

1266
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,925
Well, I mean, for one
thing, you were right.

1267
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,322
You are missing about
$10,000 from the store.

1268
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,960
And then, Pete's record
not selling well.

1269
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,405
Pete's record not selling...

1270
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,721
I thought we weren't supposed
to hear for three weeks.

1271
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,126
We heard. You heard?

1272
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,406
And they're bad.

1273
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,801
It's that and it's the money that
he's been lending his father.

1274
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,723
That's creating a strain.

1275
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,929
How much have we lent him?

1276
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,201
Eighty thousand.

1277
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,001
Did you say 8,000 or 80,000?

1278
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,721
80,000, over the past
couple of years.

1279
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,964
And then you missed
the mortgage payment.

1280
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,201
On the house?

1281
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,807
And you missed the
rental on the office.

1282
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,846
Does Pete know that?

1283
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,566
Yeah, we're on the
phone all the time.

1284
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,729
Look, I know you're going
through a hard time.

1285
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:51,407
And I want you guys to know
that we're here for you, okay?

1286
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,648
Anything you guys need,
that's why we're here.

1287
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,808
We're here for times like this.

1288
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,326
What are you gonna do?

1289
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,402
There's not much I can do.

1290
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,726
What are you doing?

1291
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,121
<i>I'm drawing the album cover
for Van Halen's Diver Down.</i>

1292
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,449
If you spent a little bit more
time focusing on Graham Parker

1293
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,851
instead of drawing album covers,

1294
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,605
I wouldn't be in
this predicament.

1295
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,444
I'm focused on Graham Parker.

1296
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,284
You're supposed to
help me with him.

1297
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,880
You're supposed to
call the companies.

1298
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,281
You're supposed to get
people to the show.

1299
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,044
I've done everything
I can, Pete.

1300
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,849
You had me pushing
around a corpse.

1301
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,328
It was like being in fucking
Weekend at Graham's.

1302
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,164
What should we do?
I'm out of ideas.

1303
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,044
You fly in The Rumour.

1304
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:42,324
I can't sell a reunion concert
without the band, it's ridiculous.

1305
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,643
With what? I can't afford it.

1306
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,291
You put this on yourself.
You wanted the responsibility.

1307
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,966
Take it on the fucking chin,
and stop acting like a bitch.

1308
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,565
What did you call me?

1309
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:52,766
Chin.

1310
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,641
Pete. Wait, Pete!

1311
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,485
Hey, I have an apartment.

1312
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,403
I have health insurance,
I have car payments.

1313
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,686
I have responsibilities.

1314
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,570
You have responsibilities?
Don't talk to me about responsibilities.

1315
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,007
I have a life. I have a family.

1316
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:10,244
I can't afford to sit in my apartment
getting high, jerking off,

1317
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,005
and then going to Tommy's Chili
Burgers at 3:00 in the morning.

1318
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,401
That's not even the order
that that happens in!

1319
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,162
I have everything to lose, here.
Everything.

1320
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:22,161
Yes, because you spent thousands
of dollars on shit we don't need.

1321
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,405
You really need to spend $30,000
on a fucking neon sign, dude?

1322
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:30,606
Which is inside, it's not even outside.
We know where we work.

1323
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,440
If you want to sign a band, you gotta
look like you're the real deal.

1324
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:36,883
Princess Labia, how much is it
to fucking fly The Rumour in?

1325
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,081
It's 12,000.

1326
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,531
$12,000!

1327
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,284
All right, you know what? Fine.

1328
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:44,204
Fly in The Rumour.
Put it on my AmEx.

1329
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,482
No, you said it was impossible.

1330
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,683
I don't think I
said "impossible."

1331
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,046
Yeah.

1332
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,884
I usually don't
say "impossible."

1333
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:56,691
I like to leave
some wiggle room.

1334
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:01,887
You said that my fibroid
was like a giant boulder,

1335
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:05,646
like the one from the
Indiana Jones movies

1336
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,610
blocking up my uterus. Uterus.

1337
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:11,841
And I need to stop using that
reference of Indiana Jones.

1338
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:16,568
I think that that's not appropriate when
talking about the reproductive system.

1339
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,086
It's okay.

1340
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,243
Anyway, somehow the Eastern
medicine has worked,

1341
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,131
and the fibroid has dissipated.

1342
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,084
That's great! Yes.

1343
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,361
Wow. Yes.

1344
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:31,489
Your fibroid shrunk and somehow

1345
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,643
it allowed you to get pregnant.

1346
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,161
What?

1347
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:43,166
You're gonna have
your third baby.

1348
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,964
Congratulations.

1349
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,961
No.

1350
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,206
Yes.

1351
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,925
Would you like some water?

1352
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,330
That's good news.

1353
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,771
Another baby.

1354
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,001
At 40.

1355
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,327
Debbie?

1356
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,090
I am thrilled.

1357
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,406
And Pete is gonna be so happy.

1358
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,603
So, you're okay?

1359
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,211
What a relief.

1360
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,410
Because I can finally
relax now, you know?

1361
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,604
It's been, like...

1362
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,645
It's okay.

1363
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,684
I'm so happy, though, you know?

1364
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,127
I really am, because, I mean...

1365
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:41,841
It's good.

1366
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:45,001
Great. Great.

1367
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,364
Hey. Hey.

1368
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,047
Why are you in a bathrobe?
It's the middle of the afternoon.

1369
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:43,442
I took a late shower.
Why are you busting my balls?

1370
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,722
I'm sorry about the record.

1371
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:49,327
You're going through financial shit.
This is what I live with.

1372
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,330
This is a horrible time in human history.
What is that?

1373
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,649
It's something that might
help both of our situations.

1374
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:59,162
This is a drawing
by John Lennon.

1375
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,728
I got it 10 years
ago for $5,000.

1376
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,160
I don't know how
much it's worth now.

1377
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,560
It could be five,
it could be 20.

1378
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,289
I don't want this.

1379
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,483
I don't even like it.
I'm not gonna hang it up.

1380
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,286
It's not for you to hang up.
It's for you to sell.

1381
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,521
That way, I can give it to
you and you make some money,

1382
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,085
and Debbie won't know that
I'm giving you anything.

1383
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,244
You're not giving me money.
You're giving me a project.

1384
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:22,051
I don't know how to sell this.
I'm not an art dealer.

1385
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,720
<font color="#D900D9"></font> I don't know. Sell it online.

1386
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,287
You know, do some research,
make some calls.

1387
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,927
Or is that too hard to do with
your high blood pressure?

1388
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,048
All right. Don't get snippy.

1389
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,804
Just because you write a great
song doesn't mean you can draw.

1390
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,606
It's incredible.
John Lennon drew it.

1391
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,326
I think it's a Ringo.

1392
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,968
Don't beat me up if
I get $300 for it.

1393
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,607
Don't take anything less
than $6,500 for that.

1394
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,842
It's very valuable.
It's important to me.

1395
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,524
I want you to sell it
so I can help you.

1396
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,960
Okay.

1397
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,242
All right.
I'll see you at my party.

1398
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,641
What should I bring?
You want wine or something?

1399
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,288
No, don't buy wine with my money
and give it to me at my party.

1400
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:00,487
That's mean.

1401
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,204
I love you. Bye. All right.

1402
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,609
How do I call eBay?

1403
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:09,567
I mean, he called me a bitch.
What am I supposed to say?

1404
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,088
But I think maybe that
might mean he likes me.

1405
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,607
I don't know. It's making me really...
It's really awkward.

1406
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,010
I think he might like you.

1407
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,131
She's so cute. She's so tall.

1408
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:26,606
I know.

1409
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:27,767
How did that happen?

1410
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,768
Do you ever wish we
had a bigger family?

1411
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,889
<font color="#D900D9"></font> No. Never for a second.

1412
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:37,966
Never.

1413
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,610
Never? Never.

1414
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,286
I love what we have.

1415
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,846
One? A breeze.

1416
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,571
Two? Brutal.

1417
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,287
Three? Put a bullet in my head.

1418
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,481
Ugh.

1419
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,169
You know, I think about that
gray-haired pregnant lady from school,

1420
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,163
and I just feel bad for her.

1421
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,322
And I feel bad for the kid.

1422
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,045
Can you imagine?

1423
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,288
All the other little kids,
"Where's your mommy?"

1424
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:04,285
"Oh, she's the one sitting in that
scooter, eating a soft cracker."

1425
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,167
Kids don't want to
have old parents.

1426
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:10,245
You know what? It would also be nice
for us to spend some time apart.

1427
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,450
Kind of rediscover who
we are, individually.

1428
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,251
It'd be so great to not see
you for a chunk of time,

1429
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,890
so that I could
really just miss you.

1430
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,684
Remember when we used
to miss each other?

1431
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,890
Hey! Hey, you.

1432
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,486
Yeah, what's up?

1433
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,040
Hey, I'm Sadie's mom.

1434
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:39,641
Sadie?

1435
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,643
Sadie, the one you chat
with on the Internet.

1436
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,001
No, man. That ain't me.

1437
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,844
Well, it was you.
I saw your picture.

1438
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,130
Did you make a hot list?
And not put Sadie on the hot list?

1439
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,686
She was not on my list, no.

1440
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,126
You know what I'm gonna do?

1441
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,480
I'm gonna make my own hot list.

1442
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,564
And you know what?
You're on the not-hot list.

1443
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,926
How does that feel?

1444
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:00,561
It doesn't bother me.
I'm comfortable with the way I am.

1445
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,887
Maybe you shouldn't be so
comfortable with yourself.

1446
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,565
You know why?

1447
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:07,087
You look like a
miniature Tom Petty.

1448
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,731
How's that feel?

1449
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,689
You think that haircut's cool?
It's not.

1450
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,566
It looks like you put your
Justin Bieber wig on backwards.

1451
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,724
Are you still comfortable
with yourself?

1452
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,883
Why are you wearing a tank top?
Huh?

1453
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:21,931
So you can show off your little bald
pits, you little hairless wonder?

1454
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,521
Cool tank top, man. Huh?

1455
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:29,520
So next time you think about
writing something nasty

1456
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,729
on my daughter's Facebook
page, just remember me.

1457
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:33,927
Remember me.

1458
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:38,287
I will come down here,
and I will fuck you up.

1459
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,601
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Okay, I'm sorry.

1460
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:41,609
Wait a minute. Hey, hey, hey!

1461
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,725
Wait. You're not...
Are you crying?

1462
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:44,927
Just let me go.

1463
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:46,366
Oh, my...

1464
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,170
I'm sorry. Okay.

1465
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:50,841
I'm sorry.

1466
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,202
I'm not in my right head.

1467
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:55,806
I understand.
My mom's going through menopause, too.

1468
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:56,967
It's a hard time.

1469
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,646
What'd you say?

1470
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,085
Are you going through menopause?

1471
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,361
I'm not going through menopause.

1472
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:05,649
I'm not gonna go through
menopause for like 20 years.

1473
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,889
I'm pregnant, you little bitch.

1474
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,206
God damn it!

1475
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,131
God damn it!

1476
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,080
I'm going out with Desi to find
out if she's stealing from us.

1477
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,640
I've got the Graham Parker concert.
Who's gonna watch the kids?

1478
01:10:21,471 --> 01:10:23,633
I don't know. Figure it out.

1479
01:10:29,471 --> 01:10:31,314
</font>I kind of just wanted to talk.

1480
01:10:31,391 --> 01:10:35,191
I thought maybe we could go to
a coffeehouse or something.

1481
01:10:35,351 --> 01:10:37,877
You want coffee?
This place has coffee.

1482
01:10:37,951 --> 01:10:39,874
They have all kinds of drinks.

1483
01:10:40,311 --> 01:10:41,312
Um...

1484
01:10:41,551 --> 01:10:43,838
But someplace quiet, maybe.

1485
01:10:44,151 --> 01:10:45,721
This place can be quiet.

1486
01:10:45,911 --> 01:10:48,118
There's a spot in the back.
It's pretty quiet.

1487
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:51,154
What sport do you guys play?

1488
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,597
We play hockey.

1489
01:10:53,031 --> 01:10:54,362
Oh, I like hockey.

1490
01:10:54,511 --> 01:10:55,637
Who do you guys play for?

1491
01:10:55,831 --> 01:10:57,481
We play for the
Philadelphia Flyers.

1492
01:10:57,551 --> 01:10:59,474
So, you guys are all
from Philadelphia?

1493
01:10:59,671 --> 01:11:01,002
</font> No.

1494
01:11:01,071 --> 01:11:02,436
Actually, none of us are.

1495
01:11:02,551 --> 01:11:04,201
Do you guys still have
all of your teeth?

1496
01:11:04,471 --> 01:11:08,840
Well, I got all my teeth
except these ones. <font color="#D900D9"></font>

1497
01:11:08,991 --> 01:11:10,197
Do you want to try them on?

1498
01:11:10,311 --> 01:11:11,597
Yeah, I'll do it. Go for it.

1499
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:16,957
Do I look sexy?

1500
01:11:17,031 --> 01:11:18,237
</font> Yeah!

1501
01:11:18,831 --> 01:11:20,071
Do you want to make out with me?

1502
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:22,876
Oh, yeah.

1503
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:28,392
Wow.

1504
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:30,479
They definitely look way better
on her than they do on you.

1505
01:11:30,591 --> 01:11:31,672
Here we go.

1506
01:11:33,511 --> 01:11:34,717
Thank you.

1507
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:37,761
So, should we go
to the quiet area?

1508
01:11:38,071 --> 01:11:39,436
No, no, no.

1509
01:11:40,391 --> 01:11:41,438
Where are you going?

1510
01:11:41,551 --> 01:11:43,952
We kind of have to have a little
business meeting tonight.

1511
01:11:44,111 --> 01:11:45,237
Business meeting?

1512
01:11:45,351 --> 01:11:47,080
Girls, you gotta celebrate because
we won tonight. Let's go.

1513
01:11:47,151 --> 01:11:48,835
I want to party with these winners.
Come on, Deb.

1514
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:50,672
Just come to the stage
and dance with us.

1515
01:11:51,191 --> 01:11:52,238
Yeah. Okay.

1516
01:11:52,551 --> 01:11:53,791
Yeah!

1517
01:11:54,231 --> 01:11:56,074
Okay, let's fucking dance!

1518
01:11:58,031 --> 01:11:59,271
Yeah!

1519
01:12:01,431 --> 01:12:04,560
<i></font> Don't be shy, feel free to come
down and fill up these empty seats.</i>

1520
01:12:05,191 --> 01:12:07,478
<i>Thank you so much for coming.
This is so exciting!</i>

1521
01:12:08,951 --> 01:12:11,955
<i>For the first time
in over 30 years,</i>

1522
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:15,039
<i>Graham Parker & The Rumour.</i>

1523
01:12:56,231 --> 01:12:58,632
Where are his fans?
I mean, where are they?

1524
01:12:58,991 --> 01:13:04,077
It's hard to watch a band when you
know all of them remember D-Day.

1525
01:13:10,591 --> 01:13:12,081
What was the press turnout like?

1526
01:13:13,711 --> 01:13:15,236
Oh. You're serious?

1527
01:13:15,671 --> 01:13:17,753
Nobody came. Nobody.

1528
01:13:17,991 --> 01:13:19,197
Nobody is here?

1529
01:13:19,431 --> 01:13:21,240
The guy from Green Day is here.

1530
01:13:21,351 --> 01:13:23,513
Yeah, Billie Joe, I emailed him.
He's a fan.

1531
01:13:23,951 --> 01:13:25,715
You gotta get a photo
of the two of them.

1532
01:13:25,791 --> 01:13:27,395
No, he says he doesn't
want to do any press.

1533
01:13:27,471 --> 01:13:28,882
He's just watching the show.

1534
01:13:28,951 --> 01:13:32,592
Oh, how punk-rock of him.
"I don't like photographs."

1535
01:13:33,831 --> 01:13:35,196
Grow up, Green Day!

1536
01:13:35,631 --> 01:13:37,201
Shut the fuck up, Tom Selleck!

1537
01:13:54,631 --> 01:13:56,315
It's so good you did this.

1538
01:13:59,751 --> 01:14:02,322
Pete, I wanted to let you know that I
got offered a job at Sony Records,

1539
01:14:02,391 --> 01:14:03,677
and I think I'm gonna take it.

1540
01:14:03,791 --> 01:14:05,236
I used to work for Sony.

1541
01:14:05,311 --> 01:14:06,801
No, I know. They love you there.

1542
01:14:06,911 --> 01:14:10,597
Who did you interview with?
John Cleary.

1543
01:14:11,511 --> 01:14:15,482
I hired John Cleary.
He hired me.

1544
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:16,712
What do you know?

1545
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:18,919
He only had lovely
things to say about you.

1546
01:14:18,991 --> 01:14:21,756
No, he's a dick, and
he's gonna fuck you too.

1547
01:14:21,831 --> 01:14:23,595
Not if I do a really good job.

1548
01:14:24,271 --> 01:14:27,559
Really? I signed Pearl Jam.

1549
01:15:18,271 --> 01:15:19,432
You don't have, like...

1550
01:15:19,511 --> 01:15:23,232
I wouldn't call them
classically good dance moves,

1551
01:15:24,071 --> 01:15:25,516
but you left it all out there.

1552
01:15:25,591 --> 01:15:26,831
You're a blast to dance with.

1553
01:15:27,391 --> 01:15:28,438
Thank you.

1554
01:15:28,551 --> 01:15:31,395
We're having a little shindig
at the hotel after this.

1555
01:15:31,471 --> 01:15:34,600
You should come by and
hang out at the hotel.

1556
01:15:36,551 --> 01:15:38,713
You want me to
come to the hotel?

1557
01:15:38,911 --> 01:15:40,959
Yes, I want you to come

1558
01:15:41,831 --> 01:15:43,242
by the hotel with me.

1559
01:15:44,751 --> 01:15:46,594
Well, what would we do there?

1560
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:50,915
Maybe we can find somewhere quiet and
have fun and kind of see where it goes.

1561
01:15:51,111 --> 01:15:55,912
Do it like adults
do sometimes and...

1562
01:15:56,431 --> 01:15:57,956
Like, sex?

1563
01:15:59,351 --> 01:16:01,797
I mean, if you want.

1564
01:16:02,071 --> 01:16:06,315
If that's on the docket, but
I'm not trying to force that.

1565
01:16:06,591 --> 01:16:08,593
So, you would do sex with me?

1566
01:16:08,871 --> 01:16:10,077
"Do sex"?

1567
01:16:10,351 --> 01:16:11,841
What are you, Borat?

1568
01:16:12,071 --> 01:16:13,277
Are you hitting on me?

1569
01:16:13,391 --> 01:16:14,916
Yes, yes, I'm hitting on you.

1570
01:16:15,151 --> 01:16:18,837
You're hot and cool and nice
and you have beautiful eyes.

1571
01:16:21,511 --> 01:16:22,797
I'm sorry.

1572
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:26,115
I'm married, I have two
kids and I'm pregnant.

1573
01:16:28,311 --> 01:16:31,793
That is what we call the hat-trick.
Wow.

1574
01:16:32,231 --> 01:16:33,562
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

1575
01:16:33,671 --> 01:16:37,437
I was just really enjoying
you being so nice to me.

1576
01:16:38,391 --> 01:16:41,793
I hope this doesn't come
off as super-cheesy,

1577
01:16:42,311 --> 01:16:46,077
but I think you're
a very rare find.

1578
01:16:46,471 --> 01:16:47,757
Thank you.

1579
01:16:47,911 --> 01:16:49,481
And I would totally
"do sex" with you.

1580
01:16:53,071 --> 01:16:54,755
</font> That was spectacular, guys.

1581
01:16:54,831 --> 01:16:56,913
Really well done. Amazing.

1582
01:16:56,991 --> 01:16:58,800
Thank you. Good, good.

1583
01:16:59,751 --> 01:17:00,752
Hey, Graham.

1584
01:17:01,071 --> 01:17:02,596
Pete. How are you, man?

1585
01:17:02,711 --> 01:17:05,078
Well, the first numbers came in.

1586
01:17:05,311 --> 01:17:06,801
Yeah, right, yeah.

1587
01:17:07,071 --> 01:17:08,357
Happy? How's it looking?

1588
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:11,273
About half of your last record.

1589
01:17:11,511 --> 01:17:13,912
Ah. So, you were
expecting it to sell?

1590
01:17:14,871 --> 01:17:17,920
They never sell anymore.
They used to sell, but now they don't.

1591
01:17:18,231 --> 01:17:20,916
I'm not a sexy 16-year-old girl.

1592
01:17:21,151 --> 01:17:23,279
But I wanted to sell it.
It's such a good record.

1593
01:17:23,351 --> 01:17:24,762
I feel like I let you down.

1594
01:17:25,031 --> 01:17:28,478
No, I'm gonna be fine, man.
My overheads are so low.

1595
01:17:28,871 --> 01:17:30,714
<i>I just got a song in Glee.</i>

1596
01:17:31,031 --> 01:17:34,035
The guy in the wheelchair is gonna
sing it to the Asian girl, I believe.

1597
01:17:34,111 --> 01:17:36,398
I don't know, I've never seen the
show, but that's what I'm told.

1598
01:17:36,511 --> 01:17:39,799
The secret is, make sure
you have a small nut.

1599
01:17:40,271 --> 01:17:41,796
That's the key to life.

1600
01:17:41,951 --> 01:17:43,840
Graham, I don't have
small nuts, all right?

1601
01:17:43,951 --> 01:17:45,953
I have big nuts and I
need to provide for them.

1602
01:17:46,031 --> 01:17:47,999
Graham! Hey, what's up?

1603
01:17:48,111 --> 01:17:49,192
Billie!

1604
01:17:49,271 --> 01:17:50,511
Graham, how are you doing, man?

1605
01:17:50,551 --> 01:17:52,076
Great fucking show, man.
Good to see you.

1606
01:17:52,151 --> 01:17:53,357
Thank you. Fuck.

1607
01:17:53,471 --> 01:17:55,041
Yeah, I'm inspired.

1608
01:17:55,111 --> 01:17:56,636
I want to write a
fucking song right now.

1609
01:17:56,711 --> 01:17:57,712
Inspired. Yeah.

1610
01:17:57,791 --> 01:17:58,872
That inspires me.

1611
01:17:58,951 --> 01:18:00,512
Let's go get a drink.
Let's get a drink.

1612
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:01,712
All right. You coming?

1613
01:18:01,791 --> 01:18:04,271
No, no, I'm fine. You guys go.

1614
01:18:04,911 --> 01:18:06,879
<i>Congratulations on Glee.</i>

1615
01:18:06,991 --> 01:18:08,675
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Oh! Yes, thank you.

1616
01:18:08,911 --> 01:18:10,322
All right. See you, Pete.

1617
01:18:10,551 --> 01:18:12,201
All right. So long, guys. Later.

1618
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:13,352
</font> Yeah, yeah.

1619
01:18:13,511 --> 01:18:15,354
<i>You got a song on Glee? Yeah.</i>

1620
01:18:15,471 --> 01:18:17,678
That's killer, man.
That's so much money.

1621
01:18:17,911 --> 01:18:20,152
It's great.
It's good for all of us.

1622
01:18:48,671 --> 01:18:50,992
</font> Why did you put that guy's
teeth in your mouth?

1623
01:18:52,231 --> 01:18:53,915
That's so gross.</font>

1624
01:18:54,511 --> 01:18:56,195
<font color="#D900D9"></font> I was drunk. He was dirty.

1625
01:18:56,431 --> 01:18:58,195
No, he was wearing a tie.

1626
01:18:58,871 --> 01:19:00,396
That's true. He wasn't dirty.

1627
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:04,193
When I kissed him, I felt his little
tiny teeth nubs with my tongue.

1628
01:19:04,351 --> 01:19:05,682
You did? Yeah.

1629
01:19:05,911 --> 01:19:07,322
It was like kissing a baby.

1630
01:19:07,471 --> 01:19:08,597
French-kissing a baby.

1631
01:19:12,951 --> 01:19:15,318
Can I ask you something stupid?
Uh-huh.

1632
01:19:15,671 --> 01:19:18,880
Do you know why we're
missing money at the store?

1633
01:19:19,031 --> 01:19:20,192
Are you guys missing money?

1634
01:19:20,391 --> 01:19:22,598
Yeah. Like, $12,000.

1635
01:19:23,231 --> 01:19:24,517
Do you think that I took it?

1636
01:19:26,671 --> 01:19:28,560
No. I mean... Well, no.

1637
01:19:28,671 --> 01:19:30,912
I did and I don't now.

1638
01:19:31,231 --> 01:19:32,312
It's not me.

1639
01:19:32,391 --> 01:19:37,192
Why do you live in such a nice
apartment and have such a fancy car?

1640
01:19:37,551 --> 01:19:40,395
Yes, you're right. Um... Look...

1641
01:19:42,831 --> 01:19:46,313
lam an escort.

1642
01:19:47,511 --> 01:19:50,242
I get paid to go out on dates.

1643
01:19:50,751 --> 01:19:51,912
You...

1644
01:19:52,071 --> 01:19:53,152
Oh.

1645
01:19:53,511 --> 01:19:55,912
But only three to
five times a year.

1646
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:57,397
Ten times, max.

1647
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:04,522
But it's not technically prostitution,
because I don't have to sleep with them.

1648
01:20:04,751 --> 01:20:05,877
Oh, well, that's good.

1649
01:20:05,951 --> 01:20:06,998
But I always do.

1650
01:20:07,231 --> 01:20:10,280
That's why I only do it
four to eight times a year.

1651
01:20:10,471 --> 01:20:11,632
Fifteen times, max.

1652
01:20:11,951 --> 01:20:13,032
Huh.

1653
01:20:13,471 --> 01:20:15,200
One year, I did it 20.

1654
01:20:15,471 --> 01:20:18,156
Well, as long as you
think it's safe.

1655
01:20:18,271 --> 01:20:19,397
It's safe.

1656
01:20:19,911 --> 01:20:22,437
I only do it 10 to
30 times a year.

1657
01:20:22,991 --> 01:20:24,834
So, who do you think
is stealing money?

1658
01:20:26,311 --> 01:20:27,551
It's fucking Jodi.

1659
01:20:27,791 --> 01:20:29,316
No. Yeah.

1660
01:20:29,831 --> 01:20:31,276
She's a pilled-out whore.

1661
01:20:32,471 --> 01:20:33,597
Huh.

1662
01:20:35,151 --> 01:20:37,597
Since you told me, I want
to tell you something.

1663
01:20:38,031 --> 01:20:39,476
You're pregnant.

1664
01:20:39,951 --> 01:20:41,112
How'd you know?

1665
01:20:43,631 --> 01:20:44,871
Wow.

1666
01:20:45,391 --> 01:20:46,552
Maybe you should tell Pete.

1667
01:20:46,751 --> 01:20:47,877
You didn't tell Pete yet?

1668
01:20:48,151 --> 01:20:49,118
I haven't told Pete.

1669
01:20:49,191 --> 01:20:50,477
Why? I don't know why.

1670
01:20:50,631 --> 01:20:52,474
I just want him to want me.

1671
01:20:52,551 --> 01:20:55,236
I don't want him to want
me because I'm pregnant.

1672
01:20:55,631 --> 01:20:57,315
Go home and fucking
suck his dick

1673
01:20:57,471 --> 01:20:59,155
and tell him then,
and he will love it.

1674
01:21:00,071 --> 01:21:01,641
You think? He'll be so excited.

1675
01:21:01,991 --> 01:21:04,153
Or even better yet...
Better yet,

1676
01:21:04,431 --> 01:21:07,719
you should tell him while you're
sucking his dick, like...

1677
01:21:07,831 --> 01:21:08,912
"I'm pregnant."

1678
01:21:15,671 --> 01:21:17,241
What are you doing?

1679
01:21:17,391 --> 01:21:19,234
Um, returning some emails.

1680
01:21:19,711 --> 01:21:21,600
What time do you
have to go to work?

1681
01:21:21,711 --> 01:21:23,520
Like, 10 minutes ago.

1682
01:21:24,231 --> 01:21:25,756
Do you wanna be late?

1683
01:21:26,071 --> 01:21:28,551
No, I can't be late, not today.

1684
01:21:39,831 --> 01:21:42,835
Do you see me standing
here in front of you,

1685
01:21:43,991 --> 01:21:45,152
half-naked?

1686
01:21:50,391 --> 01:21:51,438
Yeah.

1687
01:21:51,871 --> 01:21:53,600
And does that

1688
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:55,999
make you feel anything, or...

1689
01:21:56,751 --> 01:21:59,197
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Come on.
Are you trying to start a fight?

1690
01:21:59,391 --> 01:22:02,122
No, I'm not trying to
start a fight with you.

1691
01:22:02,191 --> 01:22:03,477
I'm trying to fuck you.

1692
01:22:03,831 --> 01:22:05,401
Oh, God, you know what?

1693
01:22:06,031 --> 01:22:07,601
Today, of all days,

1694
01:22:07,951 --> 01:22:10,033
is the day you need to cut
me a break, all right?

1695
01:22:10,311 --> 01:22:11,551
Whatever.

1696
01:22:11,991 --> 01:22:13,322
Oh, God.

1697
01:22:17,551 --> 01:22:18,712
What?

1698
01:22:20,031 --> 01:22:22,602
I didn't realize it
was intentional.

1699
01:22:23,191 --> 01:22:26,479
I didn't say anything because I
didn't want you to be embarrassed.

1700
01:22:26,551 --> 01:22:28,838
I thought I was being gallant.

1701
01:22:30,391 --> 01:22:32,598
All right, fine. I'm an asshole.

1702
01:22:33,111 --> 01:22:34,351
God.

1703
01:22:37,031 --> 01:22:38,237
You know what your problem is?

1704
01:22:38,311 --> 01:22:39,995
You're never, ever
in the moment.

1705
01:22:40,071 --> 01:22:43,553
You're never, ever present.
You're never in your body.

1706
01:22:43,751 --> 01:22:46,834
That's not true. I am in the moment.
You know how I know?

1707
01:22:46,911 --> 01:22:48,675
I want to get the fuck
out of the moment.

1708
01:22:49,031 --> 01:22:52,752
I swear, I can't win with you.
I just can't do it.

1709
01:22:52,951 --> 01:22:54,555
You can't just walk away.

1710
01:22:54,871 --> 01:22:56,077
Oh, God.

1711
01:22:56,391 --> 01:22:59,440
Hey! How's the record
company going, Pete?

1712
01:23:00,271 --> 01:23:01,875
What? Not great.

1713
01:23:01,991 --> 01:23:03,755
I'm still waiting for
numbers to come in.

1714
01:23:05,951 --> 01:23:07,601
What have you heard?

1715
01:23:07,791 --> 01:23:09,600
A couple numbers
have trickled in.

1716
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:11,401
It's lower than we expected.

1717
01:23:13,871 --> 01:23:16,954
Then why are you
giving Larry money?

1718
01:23:17,391 --> 01:23:18,472
What?

1719
01:23:18,751 --> 01:23:20,958
I know everything.
I talked to the accountant.

1720
01:23:21,911 --> 01:23:23,800
You know what?
I don't wanna get into some nasty fight

1721
01:23:23,951 --> 01:23:25,396
so can we please
talk to each other

1722
01:23:25,471 --> 01:23:27,121
the way the therapist told
us to talk to each other?

1723
01:23:27,311 --> 01:23:28,915
Fine. Fine.

1724
01:23:30,111 --> 01:23:34,514
It makes me feel sad
when you are dishonest.

1725
01:23:37,311 --> 01:23:40,554
I understand it makes you feel bad
when I am dishonest with you.

1726
01:23:40,631 --> 01:23:44,078
It hurts my feelings when
you treat me with contempt

1727
01:23:44,151 --> 01:23:46,597
and corner me, and try
and trick me into lying.

1728
01:23:46,711 --> 01:23:47,792
Okay.

1729
01:23:47,871 --> 01:23:51,398
It makes me sad when it's so
easy to trick you into lying,

1730
01:23:51,471 --> 01:23:53,473
because you're such
a lying shit-bag.

1731
01:23:53,791 --> 01:23:55,634
That's not...
You can't do that, you can't do that.

1732
01:23:55,791 --> 01:23:57,361
The therapist said you're
not allowed to judge me.

1733
01:23:57,671 --> 01:23:59,673
That's not a judgment,
that's just a fact.

1734
01:24:00,511 --> 01:24:01,876
Fair enough.

1735
01:24:02,071 --> 01:24:05,280
Sometimes I withhold
truth, that is true.

1736
01:24:05,911 --> 01:24:08,437
But it's only because
I'm scared to death

1737
01:24:08,631 --> 01:24:11,840
of your crazy-assed,
illogical overreactions.

1738
01:24:12,111 --> 01:24:13,351
Well...

1739
01:24:13,951 --> 01:24:16,431
It hurts me inside
and triggers me

1740
01:24:16,511 --> 01:24:18,479
when you're such a
dishonest shit,

1741
01:24:18,551 --> 01:24:21,202
that you're lending your father
money without telling me

1742
01:24:21,351 --> 01:24:23,513
while your record
company's going bankrupt

1743
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:26,595
and we're on the verge of
losing our fucking house!

1744
01:24:40,711 --> 01:24:41,911
What else are you lying about?

1745
01:24:43,151 --> 01:24:45,631
I've taken Viagra for two years.

1746
01:24:45,911 --> 01:24:48,198
I ate six muffins
downstairs a while ago

1747
01:24:48,311 --> 01:24:50,712
and my cholesterol level is 305.

1748
01:24:51,231 --> 01:24:53,233
My heart could explode
at any second.

1749
01:24:53,351 --> 01:24:55,080
These might be my
very last words.

1750
01:24:55,671 --> 01:24:58,914
Oh, and I gave Charlotte antibiotics
when you weren't looking.

1751
01:24:59,111 --> 01:25:02,558
That's why her ear got better.
So, go fuck your witch doctor.

1752
01:25:04,591 --> 01:25:07,720
What are we even doing?
What are we doing?

1753
01:25:09,031 --> 01:25:12,114
This is not making me happy.
You're not happy.

1754
01:25:12,391 --> 01:25:15,873
You don't like me.
I can feel that.

1755
01:25:16,391 --> 01:25:18,041
I'm not blind.

1756
01:25:18,751 --> 01:25:20,037
Jesus.

1757
01:25:20,591 --> 01:25:22,832
We're like business associates.

1758
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:25,080
We're like brother and sister.

1759
01:25:25,191 --> 01:25:26,477
There's no passion there.

1760
01:25:26,631 --> 01:25:28,520
We're not like brother and sister.
You know what we're like?

1761
01:25:28,591 --> 01:25:30,002
We're like Simon and Garfunkel

1762
01:25:30,071 --> 01:25:31,994
and, somehow, you turned
me into Garfunkel.

1763
01:25:32,111 --> 01:25:33,351
I don't even know
what that means.

1764
01:25:33,431 --> 01:25:34,478
Art Garfunkel.

1765
01:25:34,591 --> 01:25:38,277
What's wrong with Art Garfunkel?
He has a beautiful voice.

1766
01:25:38,431 --> 01:25:40,672
He's got an amazing voice!
He could put a harmony to anything!

1767
01:25:40,751 --> 01:25:43,231
But what I'm saying is that
you turned me into him.

1768
01:25:43,351 --> 01:25:44,876
What the hell are
you talking about?

1769
01:25:45,271 --> 01:25:46,557
Simon controls him!

1770
01:25:46,831 --> 01:25:50,438
That's because Simon
writes the fucking songs!

1771
01:25:51,111 --> 01:25:52,636
He's the better one!

1772
01:25:53,031 --> 01:25:54,601
You know what?
I see the way you look at our kids.

1773
01:25:54,711 --> 01:25:56,873
You have so much love and
compassion for them.

1774
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:59,113
You never look at me like that.
Ever.

1775
01:25:59,431 --> 01:26:01,354
Would we even still be together

1776
01:26:01,431 --> 01:26:03,672
if I didn't get
pregnant 14 years ago?

1777
01:26:04,031 --> 01:26:07,080
You know what?
I'm not gonna go down that road.

1778
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:09,236
Would we?

1779
01:26:23,911 --> 01:26:24,992
Okay.

1780
01:26:28,551 --> 01:26:31,236
You know what?
I don't want to have a party here.

1781
01:26:31,351 --> 01:26:32,512
You need to cancel it.

1782
01:26:32,631 --> 01:26:33,678
No, I'm not.

1783
01:26:33,831 --> 01:26:36,357
I already paid for the catering.
I've put down deposits.

1784
01:26:36,431 --> 01:26:39,116
And I sure as fuck am not gonna
call everybody back in two days

1785
01:26:39,191 --> 01:26:40,317
when you change your mind.

1786
01:26:47,071 --> 01:26:49,517
<i>Your girlfriend is not ugly.</i>

1787
01:26:50,991 --> 01:26:53,358
<i></font> Actually, Larry, she's not my girlfriend.
She's just a...</i>

1788
01:26:53,511 --> 01:26:56,720
<i>It's cool, buddy. You don't have
to explain your girlfriend to me.</i>

1789
01:26:57,471 --> 01:27:00,202
Can you please stop
licking your fingers?

1790
01:27:01,751 --> 01:27:04,721
Do you know how many
germs are on your hands?

1791
01:27:04,951 --> 01:27:07,158
And you're putting
them into your mouth.

1792
01:27:07,311 --> 01:27:08,995
That's gross. Stop.

1793
01:27:12,511 --> 01:27:13,592
Stop it!

1794
01:27:13,871 --> 01:27:15,282
I'm gonna kill you!

1795
01:27:15,351 --> 01:27:17,115
Hey! Sadie, enough, all right?

1796
01:27:17,191 --> 01:27:18,238
She isn't hurting anyone.

1797
01:27:18,311 --> 01:27:19,961
You want to say something,
just keep your mouth shut.

1798
01:27:20,071 --> 01:27:21,641
You have never been nice to her

1799
01:27:21,711 --> 01:27:23,281
and now she's getting
aggressive with you.

1800
01:27:23,351 --> 01:27:25,638
I told you this would happen.

1801
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:35,072
I'm sick of everybody fighting.

1802
01:28:14,911 --> 01:28:18,518
What do you think you're gonna
be like when you grow up?

1803
01:28:20,431 --> 01:28:22,320
I don't know. Um...

1804
01:28:24,231 --> 01:28:25,756
I don't know.

1805
01:28:26,271 --> 01:28:28,433
Do you think you want kids?

1806
01:28:28,551 --> 01:28:30,041
Mm-hmm. Just one.

1807
01:28:30,191 --> 01:28:31,397
Just one, why?

1808
01:28:31,591 --> 01:28:36,279
Because if I have two, then the other
will fight with the other one.

1809
01:28:37,111 --> 01:28:39,637
Does it make you sad
when you fight?

1810
01:28:40,231 --> 01:28:42,802
Mm-hmm.
I don't want anyone to fight.

1811
01:28:50,311 --> 01:28:51,312
I love you.

1812
01:29:20,951 --> 01:29:24,672
Why isn't anybody talking?
Why is it so quiet?

1813
01:29:27,751 --> 01:29:29,879
<i>It's the Sounds of Silence.</i>

1814
01:30:00,351 --> 01:30:01,955
Will you stop, Dad?

1815
01:30:05,831 --> 01:30:07,833
How many of those
are you gonna eat?

1816
01:30:08,031 --> 01:30:09,521
As many as I want.

1817
01:30:09,831 --> 01:30:11,276
I'm gonna tell Mom on you.

1818
01:30:11,391 --> 01:30:13,314
Try it.
See what you get for Christmas.

1819
01:30:13,671 --> 01:30:14,718
Nothing.

1820
01:30:16,271 --> 01:30:18,558
Snitches wind up in ditches.

1821
01:30:18,871 --> 01:30:20,396
Remember that.

1822
01:30:25,551 --> 01:30:26,712
Hey, Peter.

1823
01:30:26,871 --> 01:30:28,236
Hi. Hiya.

1824
01:30:32,551 --> 01:30:34,360
All right. See you.

1825
01:30:35,231 --> 01:30:36,437
Have a good one.

1826
01:30:37,031 --> 01:30:38,192
Peter.

1827
01:30:38,271 --> 01:30:39,352
Peter!

1828
01:30:41,351 --> 01:30:42,398
Hi.

1829
01:30:42,631 --> 01:30:43,632
Catherine.

1830
01:30:43,711 --> 01:30:44,792
I'm Joseph's mother.

1831
01:30:45,231 --> 01:30:47,233
Oh, right. No, I know.
Hi, Catherine.

1832
01:30:47,511 --> 01:30:49,718
Our kids have gone to school
together for eight years.

1833
01:30:50,391 --> 01:30:51,472
Sorry.

1834
01:30:51,751 --> 01:30:53,241
Hello, Joseph.

1835
01:30:54,591 --> 01:30:57,071
I hear our kids have
been chatting online.

1836
01:30:57,391 --> 01:31:00,122
Yeah? I heard that your wife
has been screaming at my son.

1837
01:31:00,191 --> 01:31:01,841
And I don't appreciate it.
Excuse me?

1838
01:31:02,071 --> 01:31:03,755
She screamed at my son.

1839
01:31:03,911 --> 01:31:06,915
Right? She threatened you.
She screamed at you. She cursed at him.

1840
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:09,321
He's 13 years old,
for God's sake.

1841
01:31:09,391 --> 01:31:10,995
What the hell is the
matter with her?

1842
01:31:11,071 --> 01:31:13,031
Okay, you better check her
meds and get 'em right.

1843
01:31:14,311 --> 01:31:17,599
Okay, you know what?
Why don't you back the fuck off?

1844
01:31:17,711 --> 01:31:20,442
Because that's my lovely, sweet
wife you're talking about.

1845
01:31:20,591 --> 01:31:22,320
Oh, I need to back off?
Yeah, you need to back off.

1846
01:31:22,431 --> 01:31:25,082
Because your kid is an animal.
He's a fucking animal.

1847
01:31:25,151 --> 01:31:26,312
Why don't you put
him on a leash?

1848
01:31:26,391 --> 01:31:28,314
Turn around, turn
around, turn around!

1849
01:31:28,551 --> 01:31:29,882
If he insults my daughter again,

1850
01:31:29,951 --> 01:31:31,362
I'm gonna hit him
with my fucking car.

1851
01:31:31,431 --> 01:31:32,478
Got it?

1852
01:31:32,631 --> 01:31:34,872
In fact, if you insult my wife
again, you know what I'm gonna do?

1853
01:31:34,951 --> 01:31:36,760
I'm gonna show up at your
house when you're sleeping

1854
01:31:36,831 --> 01:31:39,562
and I'll take your iPad
or your iPod or your iMac

1855
01:31:39,631 --> 01:31:41,281
and I'll shove them up
your fucking iCunt.

1856
01:31:41,551 --> 01:31:44,282
I got nothing to lose.
Your kid is the problem.

1857
01:31:44,471 --> 01:31:46,155
My kid is a fucking angel.
Turn around.

1858
01:31:46,591 --> 01:31:48,081
I don't have time for this shit.

1859
01:31:48,431 --> 01:31:51,480
So I'm keeping it together, but if
I wasn't at school right now...

1860
01:31:53,151 --> 01:31:55,199
Touch my... Touch me?

1861
01:31:55,631 --> 01:31:57,474
I didn't touch your...
You touched my upper breast.

1862
01:31:57,551 --> 01:31:59,713
I didn't. I didn't.
I got right below your shoulder.

1863
01:31:59,791 --> 01:32:02,556
You got right here. You actually...
He hit my nipple.

1864
01:32:02,631 --> 01:32:03,678
You what?

1865
01:32:03,751 --> 01:32:04,877
You're insane.

1866
01:32:04,951 --> 01:32:06,794
Why would you do that?
Did you just touch my mom's nipple?

1867
01:32:06,871 --> 01:32:09,317
He just touched my nipple.
Why would you do that to me?

1868
01:32:09,431 --> 01:32:10,557
I poked you on the shoulder.

1869
01:32:10,631 --> 01:32:11,996
I have very high nipples.

1870
01:32:12,231 --> 01:32:13,232
I touched your shirt.

1871
01:32:13,311 --> 01:32:14,711
What do you think
is under my shirt?

1872
01:32:14,791 --> 01:32:16,156
I just...
My breasts are under my shirt.

1873
01:32:16,191 --> 01:32:17,955
Your shoulder. Your shoulder.
He just touched my breast.

1874
01:32:18,151 --> 01:32:20,836
Well, that's a funny place to
put a shoulder, on my boob.

1875
01:32:20,991 --> 01:32:23,039
Hello?
There are children around.

1876
01:32:23,151 --> 01:32:26,075
This isn't over. This is not over.
You're gonna be sorry.

1877
01:32:26,151 --> 01:32:28,153
Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1878
01:32:28,631 --> 01:32:30,998
And why the fuck would
you believe Desi?

1879
01:32:31,231 --> 01:32:32,995
You just admitted it.

1880
01:32:33,511 --> 01:32:34,512
Did I?

1881
01:32:34,591 --> 01:32:39,199
You stole $12,000 from me, Jodi,
and I need you to pay me back.

1882
01:32:39,351 --> 01:32:41,592
Could you at least
give me a referral?

1883
01:32:41,671 --> 01:32:45,357
You babysat my kids while
you were on OxyContin.

1884
01:32:45,431 --> 01:32:46,512
Oxycodone.

1885
01:32:46,671 --> 01:32:47,877
Well, oxycodone.

1886
01:32:47,951 --> 01:32:49,077
Oxycotton.

1887
01:32:49,191 --> 01:32:50,238
OxyContin?

1888
01:32:50,351 --> 01:32:51,352
Oxykitten.

1889
01:32:51,431 --> 01:32:52,717
What's Oxykitten?

1890
01:32:53,111 --> 01:32:54,112
Meow.

1891
01:32:54,191 --> 01:32:58,162
Jodi, you put me in danger.
Me and my family.

1892
01:32:58,351 --> 01:33:00,194
It was a cry for help.

1893
01:33:00,551 --> 01:33:02,679
Help. Help.

1894
01:33:03,191 --> 01:33:04,795
Why don't you help me?

1895
01:33:05,191 --> 01:33:07,159
Why don't you help me?
Just help.

1896
01:33:07,431 --> 01:33:08,762
Just help.

1897
01:33:12,031 --> 01:33:13,396
You didn't help me.

1898
01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:15,196
Are you high right now?

1899
01:33:15,351 --> 01:33:17,274
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Help me.

1900
01:33:20,111 --> 01:33:22,637
Is that about me?
Is that the cops?

1901
01:33:23,111 --> 01:33:24,272
Is this a set-up?

1902
01:33:24,351 --> 01:33:25,591
I need to go.

1903
01:33:26,031 --> 01:33:27,317
Okay, see you later.

1904
01:33:28,591 --> 01:33:30,639
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Fuck you, Debbie.

1905
01:33:30,831 --> 01:33:32,356
Fuck you.

1906
01:33:33,231 --> 01:33:35,677
Could you see it in your
heart to lend me some money?

1907
01:33:35,791 --> 01:33:40,035
I would love to lend you money, but...
Thank you.

1908
01:33:40,151 --> 01:33:42,279
I mean, there's no way I could.
Why?

1909
01:33:42,831 --> 01:33:46,517
I just wouldn't wanna
jeopardize a relationship

1910
01:33:46,591 --> 01:33:50,391
with somebody that I care
about by giving them money.

1911
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:52,281
I mean, look how far we've come

1912
01:33:52,351 --> 01:33:56,356
that you could come to me for advice
and be able to ask me to borrow money.

1913
01:33:56,831 --> 01:34:00,119
Let me ask you a question.
Who do you like better Simon or Garfunkel?

1914
01:34:00,191 --> 01:34:02,592
Garfunkel. Really? Garfunkel?

1915
01:34:02,671 --> 01:34:04,594
Yeah, he's got the
voice of an angel.

1916
01:34:04,671 --> 01:34:08,881
He's got a great voice, but what about Simon?
He wrote the songs.

1917
01:34:08,951 --> 01:34:13,479
Who cares? Everybody writes songs.
How many singers are there?

1918
01:34:13,591 --> 01:34:17,437
Simon's a good singer, too.
Art Garfunkel is a choir all in one man.

1919
01:34:17,511 --> 01:34:20,242
<i>Have you ever hear Paul Simon
sing Bridge Over Troubled Water</i>

1920
01:34:20,311 --> 01:34:24,760
in concert by himself? It's a nightmare.
It's like nails on a chalkboard.

1921
01:34:25,591 --> 01:34:27,958
Is there a chance I'm just
wrong about everything?

1922
01:34:28,031 --> 01:34:30,682
Definitely. Of course.
Absolutely.

1923
01:34:31,871 --> 01:34:34,761
Joseph was very upset when
I spoke to him about this.

1924
01:34:35,551 --> 01:34:38,282
So I thought it was
important that we

1925
01:34:39,031 --> 01:34:40,715
join together and
work this through.

1926
01:34:40,791 --> 01:34:41,952
Absolutely.

1927
01:34:42,391 --> 01:34:44,837
We're gonna work through it,

1928
01:34:44,911 --> 01:34:48,472
but Debbie told my son that
he looked like Tom Petty,

1929
01:34:49,111 --> 01:34:50,158
in a negative way.

1930
01:34:50,551 --> 01:34:52,633
Who's Tom Petty?
You know who Tom Petty is.

1931
01:34:53,551 --> 01:34:57,033
And she said that if she had to
come back that she was going to...

1932
01:34:57,231 --> 01:35:00,997
"F" up his pussy-ass,
which is what she said.

1933
01:35:01,071 --> 01:35:02,197
Oh, my...

1934
01:35:02,591 --> 01:35:03,831
Are you serious?

1935
01:35:04,191 --> 01:35:07,274
I didn't. I would never.
To a child?

1936
01:35:08,031 --> 01:35:12,992
Your son has been defiling my daughter's
Facebook page now for months.

1937
01:35:13,551 --> 01:35:15,041
These people are liars.

1938
01:35:15,191 --> 01:35:16,920
He said that my
son was an animal

1939
01:35:16,991 --> 01:35:18,720
and that if I didn't
keep him on a leash,

1940
01:35:18,871 --> 01:35:20,600
that he would hit
him with his car.

1941
01:35:21,031 --> 01:35:22,317
Did you say that?

1942
01:35:22,391 --> 01:35:23,552
That's ridiculous.

1943
01:35:23,791 --> 01:35:25,236
Who talks like that? You do.

1944
01:35:25,391 --> 01:35:27,234
He didn't say that.
He said it to me.

1945
01:35:27,311 --> 01:35:31,202
No. What I said was that we need
to keep an extra eye on our kids

1946
01:35:31,271 --> 01:35:33,956
because with all the
technological advances,

1947
01:35:34,031 --> 01:35:36,113
they need to learn to
use them responsibly.

1948
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:39,553
No. What he said to me was...
He called me an iCunt.

1949
01:35:39,751 --> 01:35:41,037
</font> A what? Language, Catherine!
Language.

1950
01:35:41,111 --> 01:35:42,158
</font> I'm quoting!

1951
01:35:42,351 --> 01:35:43,637
How am I gonna relay

1952
01:35:43,711 --> 01:35:46,396
what these two nutballs said
to me, unless I say it?

1953
01:35:46,871 --> 01:35:48,521
Can you please not talk
like that, Catherine?

1954
01:35:48,591 --> 01:35:50,002
<i>Music Man is
rehearsing next door.</i>

1955
01:35:50,071 --> 01:35:52,119
<i>Sorry, fucking Music Man.</i>

1956
01:35:52,431 --> 01:35:55,674
Maybe if I looked more like
this fake bullshit couple.

1957
01:35:55,751 --> 01:35:57,355
Looks like they're in
a bank commercial.

1958
01:35:57,511 --> 01:35:58,672
That's what you look like.

1959
01:35:58,791 --> 01:36:01,032
Like you're a bullshit
bank commercial couple.

1960
01:36:01,271 --> 01:36:03,842
None of this talk is productive.

1961
01:36:03,911 --> 01:36:06,915
I would like to rear up
and jackknife my legs

1962
01:36:07,071 --> 01:36:09,915
and kick you both in the
fucking jaw with my foot bone.

1963
01:36:10,271 --> 01:36:12,160
You're just really scaring me.

1964
01:36:12,231 --> 01:36:14,074
This is what happens
when you corner a rat.

1965
01:36:14,271 --> 01:36:16,478
You corner me, I will
fucking chew through you.

1966
01:36:16,631 --> 01:36:17,962
I'll chew through you.

1967
01:36:18,111 --> 01:36:19,522
Catherine, you're
better than this.

1968
01:36:19,591 --> 01:36:22,197
Fuck you, Jill.
You're a horrible fucking woman.

1969
01:36:22,391 --> 01:36:24,439
This is why everybody
hates you, Jill.

1970
01:36:24,511 --> 01:36:28,960
This kind of shit. Ineffective.
Fucking bullshit hair.

1971
01:36:30,231 --> 01:36:32,359
And I'm glad your husband died.

1972
01:36:32,551 --> 01:36:35,475
Because you're a fucking asshole.
He probably killed himself.

1973
01:36:36,071 --> 01:36:38,597
Okay, Catherine, I think we
know what's happening now.

1974
01:36:39,111 --> 01:36:41,557
Now you know what
we're dealing with.

1975
01:37:24,751 --> 01:37:26,719
I'm not gonna eat that chicken.

1976
01:37:26,831 --> 01:37:28,037
Why not?

1977
01:37:28,871 --> 01:37:30,953
Because I feel like I'm
gonna be a vegetarian.

1978
01:37:31,151 --> 01:37:33,472
Can you become a vegetarian tomorrow?
Uh-uh.

1979
01:37:33,551 --> 01:37:36,077
<font color="#D900D9"></font> You guys have been
reading my texts?

1980
01:37:36,551 --> 01:37:38,394
No, we haven't. Yes, we have.

1981
01:37:38,471 --> 01:37:40,235
We're supposed to
keep an eye on you.

1982
01:37:40,351 --> 01:37:41,398
How did you find out?

1983
01:37:41,591 --> 01:37:44,595
Joseph told me that you flipped
out on him and his mom.

1984
01:37:44,791 --> 01:37:46,839
And you guys are
nuts, and I agree.

1985
01:37:47,111 --> 01:37:48,875
All right, you know what?
Don't be disrespectful.

1986
01:37:48,991 --> 01:37:50,641
You're the ones who
are disrespectful.

1987
01:37:50,711 --> 01:37:52,873
Reading my texts is
like reading my diary.

1988
01:37:52,951 --> 01:37:55,113
And you were really
sweet on your iChats.

1989
01:37:55,191 --> 01:37:56,192
We were really proud of you.

1990
01:37:56,271 --> 01:37:58,478
Yeah, we were going to give you
your computer and phone back.

1991
01:37:58,551 --> 01:37:59,598
Fuck you!

1992
01:38:00,191 --> 01:38:02,592
Okay, there's the first
official "fuck you."

1993
01:38:02,671 --> 01:38:05,515
Okay, that is not how we talk
to each other in this house.

1994
01:38:05,591 --> 01:38:08,879
You guys talk to each other
like that all the time.

1995
01:38:09,031 --> 01:38:12,672
And to Joseph and his mom.
You made Joseph cry.

1996
01:38:13,031 --> 01:38:16,558
Joseph has a crush on you.
You like a boy who cries.

1997
01:38:16,791 --> 01:38:18,077
Shut up, Charlotte.

1998
01:38:18,871 --> 01:38:23,001
You guys so desperately want me to be
so perfect and to make no mistakes.

1999
01:38:23,071 --> 01:38:24,914
Well, you two are
fucking insane.

2000
01:38:25,111 --> 01:38:26,158
Okay.

2001
01:38:26,231 --> 01:38:29,235
All you do is fight, or you don't
fight, which is even worse

2002
01:38:29,311 --> 01:38:31,351
because it looks like you
hate each other for weeks.

2003
01:38:31,671 --> 01:38:33,958
You obsess over every
little thing I do,

2004
01:38:34,191 --> 01:38:36,319
and you don't trust in
me or believe in me.

2005
01:38:36,391 --> 01:38:37,916
Well, I'm fucking sick of it.

2006
01:38:38,631 --> 01:38:41,601
Yeah, I said "fuck."
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

2007
01:38:41,911 --> 01:38:45,518
Ground me forever, I don't care.
I don't care about anything.

2008
01:38:47,111 --> 01:38:48,954
I hate everything.

2009
01:38:49,431 --> 01:38:52,992
Everyone's going crazy.
I don't care if I have no friends.

2010
01:38:53,831 --> 01:38:55,833
<i>Are you still upset about Lost?</i>

2011
01:38:55,911 --> 01:38:57,481
<i>Of course I'm upset about Lost!</i>

2012
01:38:57,551 --> 01:39:01,192
You guys took away my shit before I
could watch the last two episodes.

2013
01:39:01,711 --> 01:39:04,191
And I don't know what
the fuck happened!

2014
01:39:08,351 --> 01:39:10,274
She's becoming just like us.

2015
01:39:11,271 --> 01:39:15,356
I hope I never get my period
if this is what happens.

2016
01:39:28,351 --> 01:39:29,637
Where did you find this?

2017
01:39:30,431 --> 01:39:31,796
I stole it.

2018
01:39:37,511 --> 01:39:38,842
Thank you.

2019
01:39:40,391 --> 01:39:41,802
No big deal.

2020
01:39:45,311 --> 01:39:47,313
Our kids are fucking crazy.

2021
01:39:47,471 --> 01:39:48,996
And it's our fault.

2022
01:39:49,271 --> 01:39:52,081
Do you think there's anything we
can do to turn it around, or...

2023
01:39:52,431 --> 01:39:55,196
Sadie's 13.
She might be a lost cause.

2024
01:39:55,431 --> 01:39:57,433
Where did she learn
that kind of language?

2025
01:39:57,551 --> 01:39:58,916
We don't talk like that.

2026
01:39:58,991 --> 01:40:00,197
I have no fucking idea.

2027
01:40:00,831 --> 01:40:03,596
Do you think Sadie is
this crazy because of us

2028
01:40:03,671 --> 01:40:06,322
<i>or is it hormones and Lost?</i>

2029
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:08,162
J. J. Abrams.

2030
01:40:08,671 --> 01:40:10,833
He's ruining our daughter. Yeah.

2031
01:40:11,311 --> 01:40:12,881
That fucking geek.

2032
01:40:13,071 --> 01:40:15,836
I feel bad for us.
I feel bad for us.

2033
01:40:15,991 --> 01:40:19,359
All of a sudden, we're like
a magnet for negativity.

2034
01:40:19,791 --> 01:40:21,998
Why do people keep attacking us?

2035
01:40:22,471 --> 01:40:25,600
What did we do?
We're just doing our best.

2036
01:40:26,391 --> 01:40:27,631
Should we talk about our fight?

2037
01:40:28,191 --> 01:40:30,000
I think we're under
enough pressure.

2038
01:40:30,071 --> 01:40:32,915
Let's just let it go, this time.

2039
01:40:33,671 --> 01:40:34,752
Yeah.

2040
01:40:35,031 --> 01:40:36,362
We can give each other a break.

2041
01:40:36,471 --> 01:40:38,439
All right, great. Thank you.

2042
01:40:38,591 --> 01:40:41,117
And I'm sorry about my dad.
You're right.

2043
01:40:42,551 --> 01:40:46,522
I'm sorry that he's
just an endless mooch.

2044
01:40:47,591 --> 01:40:50,197
The truth is that
this isn't about us.

2045
01:40:50,551 --> 01:40:51,996
It's about our parents.

2046
01:40:52,191 --> 01:40:54,671
We're not even mad at each other.
We're mad at them.

2047
01:40:54,751 --> 01:40:56,515
Exactly. Exactly.

2048
01:40:56,791 --> 01:40:59,874
Let's just take away our
parents' power by loving them.

2049
01:41:00,791 --> 01:41:01,872
Can we do that?

2050
01:41:01,991 --> 01:41:03,561
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Yes.

2051
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:04,917
Thank God.

2052
01:41:05,631 --> 01:41:07,713
I kind of feel better
already, do you?

2053
01:41:08,071 --> 01:41:09,482
Do you? I do.

2054
01:41:09,631 --> 01:41:11,440
I love you. I love you, too.

2055
01:41:15,471 --> 01:41:18,236
<font color="#D900D9"></font> It's not us, it's them.

2056
01:41:18,671 --> 01:41:19,911
Totally.

2057
01:41:31,751 --> 01:41:33,515
What are you doing?
We have to get ready for the party.

2058
01:41:33,591 --> 01:41:36,322
<i>I just watched the
last episode of Lost.</i>

2059
01:41:38,031 --> 01:41:39,157
Okay.

2060
01:41:39,591 --> 01:41:42,481
You know what?
We don't have time for this right now.

2061
01:41:42,591 --> 01:41:43,991
We have a lot of
people coming over.

2062
01:41:44,111 --> 01:41:45,397
They're all dead.

2063
01:41:45,951 --> 01:41:46,952
What?

2064
01:41:47,431 --> 01:41:50,958
Jack, Kate, Sawyer...

2065
01:41:51,151 --> 01:41:54,280
I don't care about the show right now.
Jin, Sun...

2066
01:41:54,471 --> 01:41:57,042
Okay? I need you to just get
in the shower, get dressed.

2067
01:41:57,111 --> 01:41:58,317
Let's just put it on hold.
Walt, Juliet...

2068
01:41:58,631 --> 01:42:00,235
All those people.

2069
01:42:00,391 --> 01:42:01,722
<i>Don't think about Lost today.</i>

2070
01:42:01,791 --> 01:42:04,795
<i>Tomorrow, Lost, all day.
I can't wait to hear about it.</i>

2071
01:42:04,991 --> 01:42:08,279
Jack? No way, really?
Right now, shower.

2072
01:42:08,511 --> 01:42:10,957
<i>I don't make fun of
your stupid Mad Men.</i>

2073
01:42:11,311 --> 01:42:13,518
<i>First of all, I don't get
worked up over Mad Men.</i>

2074
01:42:13,711 --> 01:42:15,236
That's because Mad Men sucks.

2075
01:42:15,311 --> 01:42:17,234
What Don Draper has gone through

2076
01:42:17,311 --> 01:42:20,315
beats whatever Jack is running
from on some fucking island.

2077
01:42:20,391 --> 01:42:23,201
Bunch of people smoking in an office.
It's stupid.

2078
01:42:23,631 --> 01:42:25,998
It's about a lot more than that.
And you don't have any kind

2079
01:42:26,071 --> 01:42:28,597
of understanding about what
it was like in the '60s.

2080
01:42:28,671 --> 01:42:30,719
You do cry during Mad Men.

2081
01:42:30,831 --> 01:42:35,200
I don't cry over it.
I appreciate it. Right.

2082
01:42:35,271 --> 01:42:37,239
You're getting me off topic.

2083
01:42:37,391 --> 01:42:39,439
Just, please, get dressed.

2084
01:42:44,151 --> 01:42:45,960
Hello. Hi.

2085
01:42:46,031 --> 01:42:47,271
I'm glad you're here.

2086
01:42:47,431 --> 01:42:49,274
I need a buffer in
case it gets weird.

2087
01:42:49,391 --> 01:42:51,359
Oh, well, I'm ready to buff.

2088
01:42:51,831 --> 01:42:53,799
Grab these napkins.
Let's buff. Okay.

2089
01:42:57,311 --> 01:43:00,793
So, that's the girl
who works for you.

2090
01:43:00,951 --> 01:43:03,272
Yeah. That's her.
Works for Debbie.

2091
01:43:03,391 --> 01:43:04,802
She seems nice.

2092
01:43:05,031 --> 01:43:07,318
My wife would never let me
have a hot employee like that.

2093
01:43:07,471 --> 01:43:08,552
Yeah? No.

2094
01:43:08,671 --> 01:43:10,400
Every woman who works for us

2095
01:43:10,591 --> 01:43:13,913
looks like they've been in some
kind of horrible accident.

2096
01:43:14,711 --> 01:43:17,362
I'm taking control, and
now you're my slave.

2097
01:43:19,191 --> 01:43:21,842
Are you comfortable with
that around your husband?

2098
01:43:22,391 --> 01:43:25,315
Oh. Pete wouldn't know
what to do with that.

2099
01:43:25,711 --> 01:43:27,315
Do you think our wives are
looking at us right now?

2100
01:43:27,391 --> 01:43:28,802
Oh, definitely. Yeah.

2101
01:43:29,191 --> 01:43:31,239
They look like pedophiles.

2102
01:43:36,791 --> 01:43:39,112
Thank you. The girls are
so excited you're here.

2103
01:43:39,231 --> 01:43:40,278
They're all outside.

2104
01:43:40,351 --> 01:43:41,682
Hi. Hi.

2105
01:43:41,951 --> 01:43:43,840
Hey, how are you?
How are you, man?

2106
01:43:43,951 --> 01:43:45,112
Good to see you.

2107
01:43:45,191 --> 01:43:46,431
Happy birthday, Pete.

2108
01:43:46,511 --> 01:43:47,637
How wonderful to see you.

2109
01:43:47,711 --> 01:43:48,872
Thank you, Grandma Molly.

2110
01:43:48,991 --> 01:43:50,072
You're wonderful.

2111
01:43:50,231 --> 01:43:53,952
And look at my gorgeous,
gorgeous, gorgeous.

2112
01:43:54,191 --> 01:43:56,842
No, I get that.
I'm just wondering why I should do it.

2113
01:43:56,991 --> 01:43:57,992
Pete, Jason's here.

2114
01:43:58,071 --> 01:43:59,118
Peter, hi.

2115
01:43:59,431 --> 01:44:00,512
Hey, how's it going, Jason?

2116
01:44:00,591 --> 01:44:02,320
You look well. Thank you.

2117
01:44:02,631 --> 01:44:04,591
How do you like what I've
been doing to your girl?

2118
01:44:04,631 --> 01:44:06,315
How you like Debbie's
"after" body?

2119
01:44:06,631 --> 01:44:07,757
It's nice. Come on. Show him.

2120
01:44:08,431 --> 01:44:10,115
Look at this. It's beautiful.

2121
01:44:10,191 --> 01:44:13,161
Look at that "after" ass.
Now, it starts here.

2122
01:44:13,751 --> 01:44:15,799
But it used to start here.

2123
01:44:16,311 --> 01:44:18,075
And I brought it up.

2124
01:44:19,111 --> 01:44:20,601
You're welcome.

2125
01:44:20,751 --> 01:44:22,640
So, are you a trainer?

2126
01:44:23,231 --> 01:44:24,801
Yes. Oh.

2127
01:44:24,991 --> 01:44:28,393
But not just physical. Spiritual.
I'm sort of a guide.

2128
01:44:28,511 --> 01:44:32,675
Mm-hmm. You guys should talk.
I think you'll get along.

2129
01:44:34,271 --> 01:44:35,272
Come here, honey.
I gotta tell you something.

2130
01:44:35,351 --> 01:44:36,432
Yeah.

2131
01:44:45,751 --> 01:44:47,401
Who's that in the pool? Mine.

2132
01:44:50,951 --> 01:44:52,760
Hello. Hello, Debbie.

2133
01:44:52,831 --> 01:44:54,117
How are you? Good.

2134
01:44:54,631 --> 01:44:56,395
Remember my husband, Pete?

2135
01:44:56,551 --> 01:44:59,794
Oh, right. I didn't recognize
you with the long hair.

2136
01:44:59,871 --> 01:45:02,317
Oh, yeah. I've been growing it.

2137
01:45:02,471 --> 01:45:03,711
Happy birthday.

2138
01:45:03,791 --> 01:45:05,316
Thank you so much.

2139
01:45:05,391 --> 01:45:06,472
Very old Scotch.

2140
01:45:06,551 --> 01:45:08,280
Wow. You know...

2141
01:45:08,431 --> 01:45:09,671
I hope it hasn't expired.

2142
01:45:11,271 --> 01:45:13,319
No, Scotch doesn't expire.

2143
01:45:13,711 --> 01:45:15,520
It improves with age.

2144
01:45:17,271 --> 01:45:20,002
Yeah. No, I know.
Thank you so...

2145
01:45:20,111 --> 01:45:22,193
That's nice. Come on in. Sure.

2146
01:45:22,271 --> 01:45:23,318
Sorry.

2147
01:45:26,551 --> 01:45:29,395
So, what do you do
in Chino, Oliver?

2148
01:45:29,471 --> 01:45:30,472
I'm a surgeon.

2149
01:45:30,591 --> 01:45:32,002
Wow. What kind? That's great.

2150
01:45:32,871 --> 01:45:34,680
Mainly of the spine.

2151
01:45:34,991 --> 01:45:38,200
My specialty is
scoliosis surgery.

2152
01:45:38,511 --> 01:45:42,277
My mom used to talk to
me like I had scoliosis

2153
01:45:42,351 --> 01:45:44,957
because I'm a little hunchy,
but that's a different thing.

2154
01:45:45,191 --> 01:45:46,841
Well, you definitely
don't look right.

2155
01:45:46,991 --> 01:45:48,402
Hey! Hey!

2156
01:45:48,711 --> 01:45:50,201
</font> Sorry we're late.

2157
01:45:50,271 --> 01:45:52,194
I was in the lab,
cloning myself.

2158
01:45:52,511 --> 01:45:54,400
We're gonna have another
seven tomorrow.

2159
01:45:54,671 --> 01:45:57,754
We cut their hair differently, so
we can finally tell who they are.

2160
01:45:57,871 --> 01:45:59,680
You like the new
haircut, Travis?

2161
01:45:59,911 --> 01:46:01,242
I'm Jack, damn it!

2162
01:46:01,311 --> 01:46:02,915
Oh. Of course.

2163
01:46:03,031 --> 01:46:04,635
Larry, this is my father.

2164
01:46:05,191 --> 01:46:07,000
Really? How are you?

2165
01:46:08,311 --> 01:46:09,801
Oliver. Oliver?

2166
01:46:10,431 --> 01:46:12,274
"Can I have some more?"

2167
01:46:12,351 --> 01:46:15,036
"Please, Oliver?
I need a little more, sir."

2168
01:46:15,111 --> 01:46:18,399
I love that movie.
You must get that all the time.

2169
01:46:18,631 --> 01:46:20,679
</font> My nose itches right here.

2170
01:46:20,871 --> 01:46:23,522
I'm sorry, excuse me.
I'm Claire and I'm Larry's wife.

2171
01:46:23,591 --> 01:46:26,481
Very nice to see you, but
I'm gonna go get the kids.

2172
01:46:26,791 --> 01:46:29,397
We won't see her now
for the whole day.

2173
01:46:29,551 --> 01:46:31,872
I'd help, honey, but you know
I got the blood pressure,

2174
01:46:31,951 --> 01:46:33,077
and I don't want to.

2175
01:46:33,391 --> 01:46:34,392
Can I get you a drink, Dad?

2176
01:46:34,471 --> 01:46:35,961
Yeah, a little white wine.

2177
01:46:36,191 --> 01:46:37,272
White wine? Yeah.

2178
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:38,961
Heavy stuff. Yeah.

2179
01:46:39,911 --> 01:46:42,357
So, who knew that
Debbie had a dad?

2180
01:46:42,711 --> 01:46:44,600
Where have you
been for 15 years?

2181
01:46:44,671 --> 01:46:48,471
Never seen you at Hanukah or
Christmas or Ramadan, nothing.

2182
01:46:48,551 --> 01:46:50,838
How you get out of all that stuff?
Do you have a wife?

2183
01:46:50,911 --> 01:46:52,481
Yeah, my wife's at home.

2184
01:46:52,591 --> 01:46:53,797
Why didn't she come?

2185
01:46:53,871 --> 01:46:56,112
Uh, construction.
They're sanding our deck.

2186
01:46:56,271 --> 01:46:57,761
You let the woman sand the deck?

2187
01:46:58,071 --> 01:46:59,561
She supervises it. Yes.

2188
01:47:00,071 --> 01:47:01,118
Okay.

2189
01:47:01,231 --> 01:47:02,232
Hey, guys.

2190
01:47:02,351 --> 01:47:06,242
Hey! Look how big the kids are!

2191
01:47:06,591 --> 01:47:08,002
Sadie!

2192
01:47:09,071 --> 01:47:10,880
Hi, Larry. Hi, Sadie.

2193
01:47:11,431 --> 01:47:14,196
Mom. Who's Oliver?

2194
01:47:14,391 --> 01:47:15,438
What do you mean?

2195
01:47:15,911 --> 01:47:16,992
Is he your dad?

2196
01:47:17,111 --> 01:47:19,352
Is he my...
He's my biological father.

2197
01:47:20,751 --> 01:47:22,116
What does that mean?

2198
01:47:22,591 --> 01:47:25,720
It means that my mom, Grandma...

2199
01:47:25,911 --> 01:47:28,960
He and my mom had a
baby, and that was me.

2200
01:47:29,271 --> 01:47:30,955
Oh, so you're our grandpa?

2201
01:47:32,031 --> 01:47:33,681
Well, why don't you
ask your mother?

2202
01:47:33,791 --> 01:47:35,634
Yeah. I guess so.

2203
01:47:35,711 --> 01:47:37,873
Then that would make him
your grandfather then, yes.

2204
01:47:38,071 --> 01:47:39,277
Do you want him to be?

2205
01:47:39,351 --> 01:47:41,194
Yes, then we get
another grandpa.

2206
01:47:41,271 --> 01:47:42,511
Come on.

2207
01:47:42,591 --> 01:47:43,592
Well...

2208
01:47:43,991 --> 01:47:46,392
Another grandpa.
Trampoline time.

2209
01:47:48,431 --> 01:47:50,638
That was deeply uncomfortable.

2210
01:47:51,871 --> 01:47:55,512
At least that pretty girl was
here to divert our attention.

2211
01:48:12,711 --> 01:48:13,917
Oh, my gosh. Hi.

2212
01:48:14,111 --> 01:48:15,795
Me, oh, my.
I did not see you there.

2213
01:48:15,871 --> 01:48:17,361
Hi. I saw you there.

2214
01:48:17,511 --> 01:48:20,481
Did you guys come together?
Are you a couple?

2215
01:48:22,551 --> 01:48:24,792
No, we didn't come together.
No, absolutely not.

2216
01:48:25,271 --> 01:48:28,514
I'm sorry, I thought...
The moustache is a little...

2217
01:48:28,711 --> 01:48:30,793
Mmm. That's fair.
<font color="#808080"> </font> I just assumed.

2218
01:48:30,871 --> 01:48:32,953
This is a straight-man
moustache.

2219
01:48:33,191 --> 01:48:36,673
What is the difference between
a gay man's moustache

2220
01:48:37,071 --> 01:48:38,516
and a straight man's moustache?

2221
01:48:38,671 --> 01:48:40,036
The smell.

2222
01:48:43,191 --> 01:48:44,681
Uh, excuse me.

2223
01:48:50,951 --> 01:48:52,715
So, spinal surgery.

2224
01:48:52,791 --> 01:48:56,955
It just seems to me to be at
the top of the surgery chain.

2225
01:48:57,151 --> 01:49:00,200
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Well, we're not cardio,
we're not neuro,

2226
01:49:00,711 --> 01:49:04,318
but I like to think we're an
important part of the spectrum.

2227
01:49:04,551 --> 01:49:06,440
Do you operate every single day?
Most days.

2228
01:49:06,591 --> 01:49:07,717
Multiple times a day?

2229
01:49:08,031 --> 01:49:09,112
Three, four times.

2230
01:49:09,671 --> 01:49:12,720
So, what's the price range?
Like, if I wanted a...

2231
01:49:13,231 --> 01:49:14,960
I'd rather not say.

2232
01:49:15,391 --> 01:49:17,917
It's so big, you're
embarrassed to say.

2233
01:49:18,231 --> 01:49:19,721
I wouldn't say "embarrassed."

2234
01:49:19,871 --> 01:49:22,078
Are there hunchbacks today?
Of course.

2235
01:49:22,151 --> 01:49:23,232
I've never seen one.

2236
01:49:23,311 --> 01:49:25,518
Well, that's because there
are spinal surgeons.

2237
01:49:25,631 --> 01:49:26,632
That's because of you.

2238
01:49:26,711 --> 01:49:28,520
Each time I don't
see a hunchback,

2239
01:49:28,591 --> 01:49:30,081
you're getting that much richer.

2240
01:49:31,831 --> 01:49:33,071
You like The Beatles, don't you?

2241
01:49:34,351 --> 01:49:35,477
Who doesn't like The Beatles?
Nobody.

2242
01:49:35,551 --> 01:49:36,552
No, nobody.

2243
01:49:37,431 --> 01:49:40,275
</font> <font color="#D900D9">So funny. You're so funny.

2244
01:49:40,591 --> 01:49:42,036
What is your sun sign?

2245
01:49:42,511 --> 01:49:43,842
Libra. Oh, boy.

2246
01:49:43,911 --> 01:49:45,515
That's not good. No, sir.

2247
01:49:45,591 --> 01:49:47,351
That's not good.
Not for me, that's not good.

2248
01:49:47,391 --> 01:49:49,200
Sexually, we're
completely incompatible.

2249
01:49:49,311 --> 01:49:50,517
That's not true. Right?

2250
01:49:50,591 --> 01:49:51,592
That's such a shame.

2251
01:49:51,671 --> 01:49:53,560
Yeah, it's as bad as it gets.

2252
01:49:53,631 --> 01:49:55,281
You don't know. What is yours?

2253
01:49:55,871 --> 01:49:56,918
I'm a Cancer.

2254
01:49:58,511 --> 01:49:59,717
Really? Is that good?

2255
01:49:59,791 --> 01:50:00,952
Wow. What does it mean?

2256
01:50:01,071 --> 01:50:02,271
That's kind of strange. Well...

2257
01:50:02,431 --> 01:50:05,799
Taurus and Cancers are, sort
of, soul mates of the Zodiac.

2258
01:50:06,111 --> 01:50:08,113
We're, like, perfectly
compatible.

2259
01:50:08,191 --> 01:50:11,115
And I balance what you lack and
you make up for what I lack.

2260
01:50:11,191 --> 01:50:15,958
And a quiet Cancer almost
always has a huge penis.

2261
01:50:17,631 --> 01:50:20,316
You're making me embarrassed.
Thank you.

2262
01:50:20,951 --> 01:50:21,952
Thank you.

2263
01:50:22,271 --> 01:50:23,272
No. Fantastic.

2264
01:50:23,431 --> 01:50:25,274
Oh, I wanted to make a toast.

2265
01:50:25,831 --> 01:50:28,801
Thank you guys for coming.
Thank you so much.

2266
01:50:29,151 --> 01:50:30,801
Pete's turning 40.

2267
01:50:30,871 --> 01:50:31,918
Weird.

2268
01:50:32,071 --> 01:50:35,632
And we're ready to start this new
phase of our lives with open hearts.

2269
01:50:35,951 --> 01:50:39,751
Ready to just choose joy
and forgive everybody.

2270
01:50:40,591 --> 01:50:42,355
So, thank you all for coming.

2271
01:50:43,391 --> 01:50:45,155
Wait. Forgive who?

2272
01:50:45,791 --> 01:50:48,158
I think she just means
in a general sense.

2273
01:50:48,231 --> 01:50:50,962
You know, just put the
past behind us...

2274
01:50:51,351 --> 01:50:52,472
And live without resentment.

2275
01:50:52,631 --> 01:50:55,077
But, specifically, who
are you forgiving?

2276
01:50:55,191 --> 01:50:58,400
I just like to know the details
before I make a toast.

2277
01:50:58,671 --> 01:51:03,154
Right. You and my dad
and, you know, others.

2278
01:51:04,791 --> 01:51:05,838
I see.

2279
01:51:07,551 --> 01:51:10,122
Well, I know you have
some issues with me,

2280
01:51:10,191 --> 01:51:12,239
but I'm curious,
what's he in for?

2281
01:51:12,351 --> 01:51:14,592
Before today, nobody
even knew he existed.

2282
01:51:14,671 --> 01:51:17,072
Well, my parents divorced
when I was really young

2283
01:51:17,151 --> 01:51:19,995
and we don't spend much time together
and I'd like to work on that.

2284
01:51:20,151 --> 01:51:23,519
Just like we would
like to work on

2285
01:51:24,751 --> 01:51:27,675
how you have financial issues.

2286
01:51:27,831 --> 01:51:30,482
She's talking about all the
lending and the borrowing and...

2287
01:51:30,591 --> 01:51:32,514
I know what she meant.

2288
01:51:33,871 --> 01:51:37,842
You are a beautiful woman, but
you are not totally maxed out.

2289
01:51:38,111 --> 01:51:40,113
I would say, honestly,
you're a six.

2290
01:51:40,191 --> 01:51:42,034
</font> Oh. A six-and-a-half.

2291
01:51:42,791 --> 01:51:44,714
I could make you an 11. Really?

2292
01:51:44,791 --> 01:51:46,839
When I found Deb, she was a 7.

2293
01:51:47,111 --> 01:51:48,317
And now she's a 12.

2294
01:51:48,471 --> 01:51:50,200
I wanna be a 12.

2295
01:51:50,431 --> 01:51:52,160
You can't be lazy.
I don't wanna be lazy.

2296
01:51:52,271 --> 01:51:54,433
Look at me. You cannot be lazy.

2297
01:51:54,671 --> 01:51:55,752
I won't be lazy.

2298
01:51:56,071 --> 01:51:57,641
Do you know how she got her body?
How?

2299
01:51:57,711 --> 01:51:59,475
Bodies by Jason. Wow.

2300
01:51:59,551 --> 01:52:01,235
Say it. Bodies by Jason.

2301
01:52:01,551 --> 01:52:03,519
Say it again. Bodies by Jason.

2302
01:52:03,711 --> 01:52:05,315
And now just say, "Jason" Jason.

2303
01:52:05,551 --> 01:52:06,677
Again. Jason.

2304
01:52:06,751 --> 01:52:07,951
That sounds right, doesn't it?

2305
01:52:08,671 --> 01:52:09,718
Yeah.

2306
01:52:11,951 --> 01:52:14,477
What the fuck is
happening right now?

2307
01:52:15,351 --> 01:52:17,399
When was the last time you two
saw each other? I'm curious.

2308
01:52:17,511 --> 01:52:19,798
Actually, we had lunch
together last week. Uh-huh.

2309
01:52:19,991 --> 01:52:21,038
And before that?

2310
01:52:21,351 --> 01:52:22,762
It's been about seven years.

2311
01:52:22,991 --> 01:52:25,198
Seven years?
That's a joke, right?

2312
01:52:25,271 --> 01:52:26,397
That's like two Olympics.

2313
01:52:26,791 --> 01:52:27,872
But I'm the bad guy.

2314
01:52:28,071 --> 01:52:29,118
All right, Dad.

2315
01:52:29,191 --> 01:52:33,719
What Debbie doesn't understand is
it's not bad to help out a parent.

2316
01:52:33,791 --> 01:52:36,795
And it's certainly not bad for
a parent to help out a child.

2317
01:52:37,151 --> 01:52:38,960
I'm sure Oliver would agree.
Well...

2318
01:52:39,071 --> 01:52:40,232
Are you really doing
this right now?

2319
01:52:40,311 --> 01:52:42,359
Am I doing what?
I didn't start the toast.

2320
01:52:42,551 --> 01:52:44,599
Are you really about to
hit up my dad for money?

2321
01:52:44,791 --> 01:52:46,759
What?
He does four operations a day.

2322
01:52:46,871 --> 01:52:48,635
It's perfect. It helps everybody

2323
01:52:48,711 --> 01:52:51,476
and it relieves his guilt from
all the abandonment issues.

2324
01:52:51,591 --> 01:52:54,117
You can't buy forgiveness.
Right, Pete?

2325
01:52:54,711 --> 01:52:57,271
I don't think anyone is looking for handouts.
I mean, you know...

2326
01:52:58,071 --> 01:52:59,277
We'd pay him back.

2327
01:52:59,351 --> 01:53:02,639
If you two are in a bind, I'd
be more than happy to help.

2328
01:53:03,391 --> 01:53:06,793
No. It's not good to borrow
money from family members

2329
01:53:07,151 --> 01:53:10,394
because it causes resentment.
Remember?

2330
01:53:10,511 --> 01:53:11,672
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2331
01:53:12,471 --> 01:53:15,680
What do you want me to do? Okay.
Admit that my life is shit?

2332
01:53:15,911 --> 01:53:17,481
Is that what you want me to say?
You happy?

2333
01:53:17,551 --> 01:53:20,998
Aren't I allowed a little joy with
these children I never wanted to have?

2334
01:53:21,791 --> 01:53:24,761
You have never once stopped
asking us for money.

2335
01:53:24,951 --> 01:53:27,158
Family helps family.

2336
01:53:27,311 --> 01:53:28,961
It's true. Family helps family.

2337
01:53:29,951 --> 01:53:32,955
Look, I don't expect you
to fully understand.

2338
01:53:33,431 --> 01:53:35,433
Your dad left.
You're broken inside.

2339
01:53:35,511 --> 01:53:37,320
It's not your fault
you can't feel love.

2340
01:53:37,711 --> 01:53:39,713
There's something
that you can't...

2341
01:53:40,831 --> 01:53:42,071
This is coming out wrong.

2342
01:53:43,711 --> 01:53:46,476
You know what? I would rather
have my dad than your dad.

2343
01:53:47,191 --> 01:53:49,080
Because he doesn't
drive me crazy.

2344
01:53:49,151 --> 01:53:51,119
You know what's the best
quality my father has?

2345
01:53:51,311 --> 01:53:52,915
Is he asks for nothing.

2346
01:53:54,511 --> 01:53:56,832
I don't know what the fuck
he's thinking right now.

2347
01:53:57,191 --> 01:54:00,161
Look at that. Nothing. Nothing.

2348
01:54:00,431 --> 01:54:01,557
I don't even know him.

2349
01:54:01,631 --> 01:54:05,192
And I turned out perfectly
fine without his input, okay?

2350
01:54:05,791 --> 01:54:09,557
I just figured out
what your problem is.

2351
01:54:10,191 --> 01:54:11,556
You hate Jews.

2352
01:54:13,031 --> 01:54:15,113
Which is so odd because
your children are Jewish.

2353
01:54:15,191 --> 01:54:16,556
Don't play the Jew card, Larry.

2354
01:54:16,711 --> 01:54:19,112
I'm not playing any Jew card.
Seriously, it's used up.

2355
01:54:19,191 --> 01:54:22,274
You can't use up a Jew card.
That's the whole point of a Jew card.

2356
01:54:22,471 --> 01:54:24,872
That's right.
You can't use it up, it goes forever.

2357
01:54:25,031 --> 01:54:27,193
You know what? I have to go.

2358
01:54:27,471 --> 01:54:29,314
Yeah, great.
What a big surprise.

2359
01:54:29,431 --> 01:54:32,674
Bye, Oliver. See you later.
See you in another seven years.

2360
01:54:32,791 --> 01:54:35,191
Make sure and say goodbye to the
grandkids who you met today.

2361
01:54:35,311 --> 01:54:37,279
You know, nothing I do
is right because of you.

2362
01:54:37,751 --> 01:54:40,994
Nothing. No matter how hard I
try, I'm just the asshole here.

2363
01:54:41,071 --> 01:54:42,675
But you know what?
You know what I realized?

2364
01:54:42,751 --> 01:54:44,435
It's you. You're the asshole.

2365
01:54:45,711 --> 01:54:47,315
Good luck working that out.

2366
01:54:47,551 --> 01:54:50,031
Happy birthday, and
go fuck yourself.

2367
01:54:50,751 --> 01:54:53,322
Hey, see you when the
Cubs win the pennant.

2368
01:54:54,031 --> 01:54:57,114
I'm gonna go light the candles.
Just get it going, okay?

2369
01:54:58,111 --> 01:55:00,631
Maybe we should try the toast again.
You know, can you be quiet?

2370
01:55:01,231 --> 01:55:02,995
You just threw me under the bus.

2371
01:55:03,071 --> 01:55:04,960
No, I don't...
You threw me under the...

2372
01:55:05,111 --> 01:55:06,556
You threw me under the bus.

2373
01:55:06,911 --> 01:55:08,800
We agreed to let go and forgive,

2374
01:55:08,871 --> 01:55:11,397
but then you started ripping
into my dad like a crazy person.

2375
01:55:11,591 --> 01:55:13,434
I'm not ripping into your dad.

2376
01:55:13,551 --> 01:55:16,839
I'm just saying to him
what you say to me.

2377
01:55:16,911 --> 01:55:18,232
</font> Don't be such a ball-buster.

2378
01:55:18,311 --> 01:55:21,360
I am not a ball-buster.
You make me one.

2379
01:55:21,431 --> 01:55:24,435
I am a fun girl.
I am fun-loving.

2380
01:55:24,791 --> 01:55:28,193
I am a "Good-Time Sally
." I dance hip-hop.

2381
01:55:28,511 --> 01:55:31,435
I cannot believe I have
wasted my whole life

2382
01:55:31,551 --> 01:55:34,282
busting the balls of
people who have no balls.

2383
01:55:35,111 --> 01:55:37,796
I'm the only one here
who has any balls!

2384
01:56:20,391 --> 01:56:21,916
God damn it.

2385
01:56:25,191 --> 01:56:26,272
Mom?

2386
01:56:29,271 --> 01:56:31,035
Mom? What are you doing?

2387
01:56:31,111 --> 01:56:32,112
What?

2388
01:56:32,191 --> 01:56:34,512
You're smoking, and
in the front yard?

2389
01:56:34,631 --> 01:56:37,555
No! No, they're Barb's.

2390
01:56:39,911 --> 01:56:40,992
Mom!

2391
01:56:41,271 --> 01:56:43,160
Since when have you
been a smoker?

2392
01:56:43,311 --> 01:56:44,312
I'm not a smoker.

2393
01:56:44,431 --> 01:56:45,921
I thought you said smokers die.

2394
01:56:45,991 --> 01:56:48,073
I'm not smoking.
I wasn't smoking.

2395
01:56:48,151 --> 01:56:49,198
I saw you.

2396
01:56:49,311 --> 01:56:50,312
</font> No, I wasn't.

2397
01:56:50,391 --> 01:56:51,836
Mom, you're smoking?

2398
01:56:52,191 --> 01:56:54,797
Deb, you can't smoke, you're pregnant.
You've been doing so well.

2399
01:56:54,871 --> 01:56:56,032
You're pregnant?

2400
01:56:56,351 --> 01:56:58,922
No effing way.
I don't want another sister.

2401
01:56:59,031 --> 01:57:00,237
I don't want her as a sister.

2402
01:57:00,831 --> 01:57:03,118
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
It just slipped out.

2403
01:57:03,471 --> 01:57:04,757
Are you pregnant?
Since when are you pregnant?

2404
01:57:04,871 --> 01:57:07,602
Since when do you care?
You don't even want another baby.

2405
01:57:08,031 --> 01:57:09,442
You have no idea what I want.

2406
01:57:09,511 --> 01:57:10,842
I want an Asian baby.

2407
01:57:10,951 --> 01:57:12,362
We're not gonna
have an Asian baby.

2408
01:57:12,431 --> 01:57:13,432
</font> Yes, We are.

2409
01:57:13,511 --> 01:57:14,922
They're not Asian. Sadie.

2410
01:57:14,991 --> 01:57:16,834
We'll buy one.
Shut up, Charlotte.

2411
01:57:16,911 --> 01:57:18,356
You shut up. Shut up, Sadie!

2412
01:57:18,551 --> 01:57:20,041
Shut up, Charlotte! Shut up!

2413
01:57:20,231 --> 01:57:22,199
Okay, Sadie, shut up.
Shut up, Charlotte!

2414
01:57:22,311 --> 01:57:23,915
Shut up!
Okay, stop saying "shut up"!

2415
01:57:23,991 --> 01:57:25,751
You're pregnant?
Since when are you pregnant?

2416
01:57:26,071 --> 01:57:27,960
When did you find out?

2417
01:57:29,471 --> 01:57:32,839
Will you stop eating
cupcakes, please?

2418
01:57:33,351 --> 01:57:37,561
Stop eating cupcakes!
Stop eating cupcakes!

2419
01:57:41,271 --> 01:57:45,242
Hey, we just heard.
You're having a baby?

2420
01:57:45,351 --> 01:57:47,035
See, it can happen to anybody.

2421
01:57:47,111 --> 01:57:49,079
That is so wonderful.

2422
01:57:49,151 --> 01:57:52,155
Let me give you a hug.
Fantastic, congratulations.

2423
01:57:52,311 --> 01:57:54,071
</font> It's wonderful.
I'm so happy for you.

2424
01:57:57,831 --> 01:57:59,640
This is too adult for you.
Let's go outside.

2425
01:57:59,951 --> 01:58:01,282
Congratulations.

2426
01:58:03,591 --> 01:58:06,162
Well, I guess we're stuck together
then forever then, right?

2427
01:58:06,231 --> 01:58:07,232
Weren't we always?

2428
01:58:07,431 --> 01:58:08,671
You didn't even want a baby.

2429
01:58:08,751 --> 01:58:10,753
Of course I do.
I never said that.

2430
01:58:11,071 --> 01:58:13,073
I didn't want one
if I could choose.

2431
01:58:13,151 --> 01:58:15,597
I should put that on a Hallmark card.
That's beautiful.

2432
01:58:15,911 --> 01:58:16,958
Debbie...

2433
01:58:17,591 --> 01:58:19,480
Good luck with the
pregnancy, Debbie.

2434
01:58:19,551 --> 01:58:21,440
But please, take
care of yourself.

2435
01:58:21,511 --> 01:58:23,479
It's a much riskier
pregnancy after 40.

2436
01:58:23,871 --> 01:58:25,441
I'm not 40. Of course you are.

2437
01:58:25,711 --> 01:58:28,555
You were born on
December 5th, 1972.

2438
01:58:28,631 --> 01:58:31,077
I'm not 40. How do you know?

2439
01:58:31,151 --> 01:58:33,961
I was there. I'm the one who took
your mother to the hospital.

2440
01:58:34,071 --> 01:58:35,311
Well, that's not what she said.

2441
01:58:35,471 --> 01:58:37,951
Your mother was in labor
for only about 20 minutes.

2442
01:58:38,111 --> 01:58:40,842
You couldn't wait to meet me.
Can you imagine that?

2443
01:58:41,031 --> 01:58:42,442
I don't even know you.

2444
01:58:42,631 --> 01:58:46,716
You can't just come into
my house and reminisce.

2445
01:58:46,951 --> 01:58:50,000
Look, maybe we're just not meant
to be in each other's lives.

2446
01:58:50,351 --> 01:58:53,036
I'm not sure this was
such a great idea.

2447
01:58:56,271 --> 01:58:58,638
Wait a minute.
Hey, wait a minute!

2448
01:58:58,871 --> 01:59:01,636
You did leave and you
didn't come back.

2449
01:59:01,911 --> 01:59:05,472
My first life was ruined.
I did my best with my second.

2450
01:59:05,631 --> 01:59:08,077
So, I ruined your life?
I was eight.

2451
01:59:08,151 --> 01:59:10,074
People do better when I
stay out of their lives!

2452
01:59:10,151 --> 01:59:11,437
That's what my son tells me.

2453
01:59:11,751 --> 01:59:13,321
You think my life is so perfect?

2454
01:59:13,391 --> 01:59:15,917
I've got a 13-year-old
who's a pothead.

2455
01:59:15,991 --> 01:59:20,041
I've got a wife who's
keeping Zoloft alive.

2456
01:59:20,431 --> 01:59:21,796
You never said that before.

2457
01:59:21,951 --> 01:59:24,921
You don't think I wanna talk to you
about this, to share it with you?

2458
01:59:24,991 --> 01:59:26,914
It's just not our way.
We don't talk to each other.

2459
01:59:26,991 --> 01:59:30,154
We don't know each other.
And I thought that's the way you wanted it.

2460
01:59:30,831 --> 01:59:32,481
How do I get out of this?

2461
01:59:32,551 --> 01:59:36,442
How do I get you all to just
help me down off the cross?

2462
01:59:38,511 --> 01:59:39,956
You sound just like Sadie.

2463
01:59:40,151 --> 01:59:41,198
Who's Sadie?

2464
01:59:41,311 --> 01:59:43,712
No, your daughter. Your younger?

2465
01:59:43,831 --> 01:59:44,798
The big one.

2466
01:59:44,871 --> 01:59:48,353
Your older. I know, I know that.
A wonderful girl.

2467
01:59:49,151 --> 01:59:51,995
Hey, guys, some of
us need to leave.

2468
01:59:52,311 --> 01:59:55,042
Would this be a good
moment to sneak out?

2469
01:59:58,511 --> 02:00:00,240
Where is Dad going?

2470
02:00:10,271 --> 02:00:12,035
Best birthday ever!

2471
02:00:18,231 --> 02:00:19,960
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Oh, shit!

2472
02:00:20,031 --> 02:00:21,112
Bike lane, asshole!

2473
02:00:21,231 --> 02:00:24,394
Fuck you, you Twilight
pimply-ass motherfuckers!

2474
02:00:25,431 --> 02:00:27,354
Your dad's still here.

2475
02:00:27,711 --> 02:00:30,191
</font> I know. It's kind of weird.

2476
02:00:30,511 --> 02:00:32,240
Where the hell is Pete?

2477
02:00:33,311 --> 02:00:34,392
Um...

2478
02:00:35,071 --> 02:00:37,312
Is it okay if Joseph hangs
out here for a while?

2479
02:00:38,551 --> 02:00:39,791
Mm-hmm.

2480
02:00:40,991 --> 02:00:42,038
Hi, Joseph.

2481
02:00:42,431 --> 02:00:43,478
Hi.

2482
02:00:44,751 --> 02:00:45,872
Do you want a piece of cake?

2483
02:00:46,071 --> 02:00:48,802
Oh! Yeah, sure. Thank you.

2484
02:00:51,911 --> 02:00:53,072
All right, then.

2485
02:00:53,831 --> 02:00:55,117
They are so cute.

2486
02:00:55,191 --> 02:00:56,238
So cute.

2487
02:00:56,351 --> 02:00:57,762
He looks exactly like Tom Petty.

2488
02:01:04,271 --> 02:01:05,796
Go around.

2489
02:01:08,671 --> 02:01:11,242
Watch it, watch it!

2490
02:01:15,111 --> 02:01:17,432
Hey, Pete! Great party!

2491
02:01:19,631 --> 02:01:20,792
Yeah.

2492
02:01:21,991 --> 02:01:23,277
The best!

2493
02:01:23,991 --> 02:01:25,231
And then we shake it.

2494
02:01:25,271 --> 02:01:27,512
<font color="#D900D9"></font> And then a restaurant comes up.

2495
02:01:28,591 --> 02:01:31,674
Dad, excuse me.
I'm gonna go look for Pete right now.

2496
02:01:31,831 --> 02:01:34,562
Would you mind staying with the
girls for just a little bit?

2497
02:01:34,951 --> 02:01:36,112
Well, if you want me to.

2498
02:01:36,191 --> 02:01:37,795
If you don't mind.
You don't have to.

2499
02:01:37,991 --> 02:01:39,117
Sure.

2500
02:01:40,591 --> 02:01:43,117
<i>Can I let Sadie show me
the last episode of Lost?</i>

2501
02:01:43,311 --> 02:01:44,642
She asked me if I'd
seen it and I haven't.

2502
02:01:44,871 --> 02:01:46,032
Yeah, that would be nice.

2503
02:01:47,471 --> 02:01:49,280
Thank you. Thank you.

2504
02:01:49,951 --> 02:01:52,477
She said we could watch it.
Come on.

2505
02:01:54,151 --> 02:01:56,722
<i>I'm gonna let you watch Lost.
Come on.</i>

2506
02:01:58,871 --> 02:01:59,997
Is it scary?

2507
02:02:00,231 --> 02:02:02,518
I'll cover your eyes
if it gets too scary.

2508
02:02:34,391 --> 02:02:36,439
Are you mad at me?
Did I say something?

2509
02:02:36,511 --> 02:02:37,797
Shh. Larry, please.

2510
02:02:52,351 --> 02:02:54,001
Are you fucking kidding me?

2511
02:02:55,191 --> 02:02:57,319
Are you fucking kidding me?

2512
02:02:58,551 --> 02:03:00,121
You opened your door on me.

2513
02:03:00,271 --> 02:03:02,877
I didn't open my fucking door on you.
I opened my door!

2514
02:03:03,391 --> 02:03:05,553
Aw, fuck. I was right there!

2515
02:03:06,071 --> 02:03:08,073
You're supposed to look
before you open your door!

2516
02:03:08,191 --> 02:03:09,477
I was in a fucking bike path!

2517
02:03:09,551 --> 02:03:11,633
That's a blind spot.
There's no fucking bike path.

2518
02:03:11,711 --> 02:03:13,992
It's a residential section.
Get your head out of your ass.

2519
02:03:14,071 --> 02:03:15,072
Pay attention!

2520
02:03:15,151 --> 02:03:16,721
Open your goddamn eyes.
What are you doing, sleepwalking?

2521
02:03:17,071 --> 02:03:20,359
You're supposed to look to see
if a biker's coming through.

2522
02:03:20,431 --> 02:03:21,478
You're supposed to look!

2523
02:03:21,551 --> 02:03:23,918
It's not my job to look out for you.
You look out for yourself.

2524
02:03:23,991 --> 02:03:25,631
I don't look out for you.
I don't see you.

2525
02:03:25,751 --> 02:03:27,879
I don't know where the fuck
you are or what you're doing.

2526
02:03:27,991 --> 02:03:30,232
No one is ever
looking out for me!

2527
02:03:30,511 --> 02:03:32,752
I need your name
and your number.

2528
02:03:32,911 --> 02:03:33,912
Why?

2529
02:03:33,991 --> 02:03:35,038
Because you're gonna
pay for my door.

2530
02:03:35,231 --> 02:03:36,232
</font> Fuck you!

2531
02:03:36,351 --> 02:03:39,753
Why don't you pay for my bike
and my face, you fucking prick?

2532
02:03:46,271 --> 02:03:47,761
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Don't disrespect me.

2533
02:03:51,151 --> 02:03:52,437
</font> Are you sure that's him?

2534
02:03:53,111 --> 02:03:54,795
I don't think that's him.

2535
02:03:57,591 --> 02:03:59,434
I gotta write down
your license plate.

2536
02:04:04,351 --> 02:04:07,082
"Range Rover of Sunland."

2537
02:04:10,351 --> 02:04:12,479
What are you doing? Ow.

2538
02:04:19,391 --> 02:04:22,634
I guess the party didn't
turn out like you planned.

2539
02:04:23,831 --> 02:04:25,754
It wasn't a good party.

2540
02:04:26,951 --> 02:04:27,998
Hi. Hi.

2541
02:04:28,071 --> 02:04:29,721
I'll bring you in as soon
as his X-rays are finished.

2542
02:04:29,791 --> 02:04:31,395
Okay. Is he okay? Okay.

2543
02:04:31,631 --> 02:04:34,396
Yeah, he has a broken rib and
he's been crying a little bit.

2544
02:04:34,471 --> 02:04:36,155
But he'll be fine.

2545
02:04:38,191 --> 02:04:41,798
You know, Pete was
never a real fighter.

2546
02:04:43,671 --> 02:04:46,072
But that's why he married you.
That's why he loves you.

2547
02:04:46,151 --> 02:04:48,153
Because you're the fighter.

2548
02:04:49,191 --> 02:04:50,238
And you need that.

2549
02:04:50,311 --> 02:04:53,281
One person in a relationship
has got to punch.

2550
02:04:54,151 --> 02:04:55,437
Do you mean that in a good way?

2551
02:04:55,631 --> 02:04:58,680
Oh, it's a high compliment.

2552
02:05:01,071 --> 02:05:02,277
Thanks.

2553
02:05:03,791 --> 02:05:05,392
Listen, I know what
you're worried about.

2554
02:05:05,671 --> 02:05:07,912
You think he's gonna
turn into me,

2555
02:05:08,871 --> 02:05:10,361
but I don't think
it's gonna happen.

2556
02:05:10,591 --> 02:05:13,640
He's smarter and
probably a little cuter.

2557
02:05:14,831 --> 02:05:16,640
A little less Jew-y.

2558
02:05:17,111 --> 02:05:20,320
Although after 50,
that's all gonna change.

2559
02:05:20,471 --> 02:05:23,361
Be prepared to wake up
one day with a rabbi.

2560
02:05:24,311 --> 02:05:26,632
But the good news is, you know,

2561
02:05:27,911 --> 02:05:29,117
he'll love you forever.

2562
02:05:29,191 --> 02:05:30,920
That's in our DNA.

2563
02:05:31,351 --> 02:05:32,955
We stick around.

2564
02:05:34,511 --> 02:05:36,479
He worries about you, you know.

2565
02:05:36,551 --> 02:05:38,280
It puts a lot of
pressure on him.

2566
02:05:38,351 --> 02:05:41,036
I know, I just don't have anyone
else to talk to about it.

2567
02:05:41,111 --> 02:05:42,556
Why don't you talk to Claire?

2568
02:05:42,631 --> 02:05:44,713
If I open up to her,
she'll leave me.

2569
02:05:44,951 --> 02:05:46,112
No, she won't.

2570
02:05:46,191 --> 02:05:48,034
Mmm. Larry, she loves you.

2571
02:05:48,111 --> 02:05:51,479
I know, but there's a certain point
at which you just can't stay.

2572
02:05:55,871 --> 02:05:57,361
I guess it's hard
to forgive somebody

2573
02:05:57,431 --> 02:06:00,082
if they don't formally
apologize to you.

2574
02:06:04,391 --> 02:06:05,631
Are you apologizing?

2575
02:06:06,711 --> 02:06:08,918
I'm very close.

2576
02:06:10,591 --> 02:06:12,161
Yes, I'm sorry.

2577
02:06:18,271 --> 02:06:20,319
I'm glad everybody's okay.

2578
02:06:21,151 --> 02:06:22,277
Okay, thanks.

2579
02:06:22,351 --> 02:06:24,353
Oh, thank you.

2580
02:06:31,191 --> 02:06:32,716
All right, I'm off.

2581
02:06:32,791 --> 02:06:33,917
Okay.

2582
02:06:35,671 --> 02:06:36,911
This is awkward.

2583
02:06:37,791 --> 02:06:38,838
What?

2584
02:06:38,911 --> 02:06:40,913
I need $40 for a cab.

2585
02:06:41,911 --> 02:06:43,800
<font color="#D900D9"></font> That's funny.

2586
02:06:44,511 --> 02:06:45,592
No, I'm not kidding.

2587
02:06:46,231 --> 02:06:47,278
Oh, yeah.

2588
02:06:47,471 --> 02:06:49,235
You drove me, honey.
I wasn't prepared.

2589
02:06:49,471 --> 02:06:51,519
I know. I only have a hundred.

2590
02:06:51,591 --> 02:06:52,638
It's okay.

2591
02:06:53,631 --> 02:06:55,713
I'll bring you the change.

2592
02:06:56,431 --> 02:06:58,877
All right.
Give him a kiss for me.

2593
02:07:18,191 --> 02:07:20,239
<font color="#D900D9"></font> I don't get it.

2594
02:07:20,711 --> 02:07:22,076
See, it's not sad.

2595
02:07:22,191 --> 02:07:26,162
It's happy, because they helped
each other achieve their destiny.

2596
02:07:27,471 --> 02:07:31,032
Great. I'm gonna have some
freaky-ass nightmares.

2597
02:07:43,231 --> 02:07:44,995
Hi. Hi.

2598
02:07:54,911 --> 02:07:56,640
I really liked our
life so much better

2599
02:07:56,711 --> 02:07:59,237
before we tried to
change everything.

2600
02:07:59,911 --> 02:08:01,276
I'm sorry.

2601
02:08:01,671 --> 02:08:05,596
No, I'm sorry.
I don't want to keep anything from you.

2602
02:08:06,871 --> 02:08:08,555
I love you, you're my wife.

2603
02:08:09,151 --> 02:08:11,552
I just didn't want
to let you down.

2604
02:08:12,871 --> 02:08:14,396
Are you mad that I'm pregnant?

2605
02:08:14,631 --> 02:08:17,362
No. I'm not mad, I'm thrilled.

2606
02:08:17,831 --> 02:08:18,992
You don't feel trapped?

2607
02:08:19,871 --> 02:08:21,794
I sometimes feel
like I trapped you.

2608
02:08:21,871 --> 02:08:23,361
I don't feel trapped.

2609
02:08:23,711 --> 02:08:25,076
Really? No.

2610
02:08:25,271 --> 02:08:27,273
You should, because
I have trapped you.

2611
02:08:27,351 --> 02:08:28,352
You can't go anywhere.

2612
02:08:29,351 --> 02:08:31,957
I'm gonna get you pregnant every 10
years for the rest of your life.

2613
02:08:32,031 --> 02:08:34,193
You can never leave me. Ever.

2614
02:08:34,351 --> 02:08:36,035
I never feel trapped by you.

2615
02:08:36,111 --> 02:08:39,399
I'm so happy to be with you
and I love you so much.

2616
02:08:39,871 --> 02:08:42,795
You're my favorite person
in the whole world.

2617
02:08:43,311 --> 02:08:45,882
God damn it, why am
I crying like this?

2618
02:08:46,351 --> 02:08:47,841
Something is wrong with me.

2619
02:08:48,231 --> 02:08:49,437
You're pregnant.

2620
02:08:49,591 --> 02:08:50,877
Oh, yeah.

2621
02:08:51,231 --> 02:08:52,312
Shit.

2622
02:08:53,031 --> 02:08:56,114
I was just outside telling
your dad that I liked him.

2623
02:08:56,191 --> 02:08:58,000
What if he thinks
I like him now?

2624
02:08:58,071 --> 02:08:59,072
No, he won't think that.

2625
02:08:59,151 --> 02:09:01,313
I don't want him to think
I like him that much.

2626
02:09:01,391 --> 02:09:02,916
No, it will never happen.

2627
02:09:03,671 --> 02:09:07,596
Can you believe it?
This is the craziest thing ever.

2628
02:09:07,671 --> 02:09:09,958
What are we gonna do
with a third baby?

2629
02:09:10,191 --> 02:09:12,432
I have no idea.
How are we going to afford it?

2630
02:09:13,311 --> 02:09:14,517
We'll sell the house.

2631
02:09:14,951 --> 02:09:16,112
We don't have to.

2632
02:09:16,191 --> 02:09:18,034
We kind of do. We kind of do.

2633
02:09:18,231 --> 02:09:20,438
We'll make new memories
in a new house.

2634
02:09:21,431 --> 02:09:22,557
I love you.

2635
02:09:24,751 --> 02:09:27,277
Is there anything you want
to do for your birthday?

2636
02:09:27,351 --> 02:09:29,513
It's been the worst
birthday ever.

2637
02:09:30,591 --> 02:09:32,671
There is one thing, but I
don't think you'll like it.

2638
02:09:32,951 --> 02:09:34,237
What?

2639
02:09:34,351 --> 02:09:37,594
I wouldn't mind going to see some music.
Would you want to do that?

2640
02:09:37,911 --> 02:09:38,912
Yeah.

2641
02:09:38,991 --> 02:09:40,038
Really? Yeah.

2642
02:09:40,111 --> 02:09:42,318
I don't believe you, but
you're sweet for saying that.

2643
02:09:42,711 --> 02:09:44,395
How do we break you out of here?

2644
02:09:44,511 --> 02:09:47,242
I can just leave on my own volition.
It's not a mental institution.

2645
02:09:47,711 --> 02:09:49,361
Can you? Yes.

2646
02:09:49,431 --> 02:09:51,232
<i>It's not like One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest.</i>

2647
02:09:52,031 --> 02:09:53,362
Please don't put a
pillow over my face.

2648
02:09:56,111 --> 02:09:57,351
Let's get outta here, McMurphy.

2649
02:09:57,431 --> 02:09:58,432
You got it, Chief.

2650
02:09:58,631 --> 02:10:00,315
Will you carry me?

2651
02:10:01,271 --> 02:10:03,114
You've been carrying
me all this time.

2652
02:10:34,151 --> 02:10:35,312
Thanks.

2653
02:10:42,991 --> 02:10:44,641
I like this song.

2654
02:10:45,471 --> 02:10:46,677
Really?

2655
02:10:47,391 --> 02:10:48,472
Why?

2656
02:10:53,591 --> 02:10:55,116
Why don't you sign him?

2657
02:10:55,191 --> 02:10:58,912
Ryan Adams?
No, he wouldn't sign with me.

2658
02:10:59,271 --> 02:11:01,080
Why not? You're the best.

2659
02:11:01,671 --> 02:11:02,672
He is in between labels.

2660
02:11:05,311 --> 02:11:07,120
Let's go try and talk
to him after the show.

2661
02:11:59,191 --> 02:12:00,795
<i></font> Thank you.</i>

2662
02:12:34,111 --> 02:12:37,115
I'm sorry if I'm not all
fancy pants and wealthy

2663
02:12:37,231 --> 02:12:40,713
and showing it all off with
my Vidal Sassoon haircuts.

2664
02:12:41,271 --> 02:12:42,272
Sorry.

2665
02:12:42,591 --> 02:12:44,116
Quit slow-blinking at me.

2666
02:12:44,631 --> 02:12:45,962
I'm sorry. Okay...

2667
02:12:46,591 --> 02:12:49,595
I would like to rear up
and jackknife my legs

2668
02:12:49,671 --> 02:12:52,641
and kick you both in the
fucking jaw with my foot bone.

2669
02:12:54,911 --> 02:12:56,993
That's what I would
fucking love.

2670
02:12:57,111 --> 02:13:00,638
I wish my fucking foot would
go right through your skull.

2671
02:13:01,711 --> 02:13:04,078
This is what happens
when you corner a rat.

2672
02:13:04,151 --> 02:13:05,312
I will fucking kill you.

2673
02:13:05,631 --> 02:13:08,316
You corner me, I will
fucking chew through you.

2674
02:13:08,471 --> 02:13:09,677
I'll chew through you!

2675
02:13:09,911 --> 02:13:13,472
Slow-blinking eyes.
I will chew off your fucking eyelids.

2676
02:13:13,911 --> 02:13:15,481
You won't slow-blink
at me, will you?

2677
02:13:15,631 --> 02:13:17,315
Did you drink before
you came here?

2678
02:13:17,391 --> 02:13:19,519
No, but I'm gonna
start drinking.

2679
02:13:19,711 --> 02:13:23,079
I'm gonna slit somebody open like
a fish and drink their blood.

2680
02:13:23,151 --> 02:13:24,516
That's what I'm gonna drink

2681
02:13:24,711 --> 02:13:27,715
if we don't start getting
to the fucking point here.

2682
02:13:28,151 --> 02:13:30,392
Probably I'm gonna start
with Karen Carpenter's head.

2683
02:13:30,991 --> 02:13:34,598
I'm gonna rip her head off and
I'm gonna drink her blood.

2684
02:13:34,871 --> 02:13:36,871
And then I'm gonna come
back and light you on fire.

2685
02:13:38,231 --> 02:13:39,596
I'm gonna light you all on fire.

2686
02:13:39,671 --> 02:13:41,514
But I'm gonna start
with you, Jill.

2687
02:13:41,791 --> 02:13:43,031
I'm gonna fucking torch you.

2688
02:13:43,471 --> 02:13:46,714
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go buy a fucking pickup truck.

2689
02:13:46,791 --> 02:13:47,997
And a cord of rope.

2690
02:13:48,071 --> 02:13:50,233
And I'm gonna string it around
all three of your fucking necks

2691
02:13:50,311 --> 02:13:52,154
and then drive around
town, dragging you.

2692
02:13:52,271 --> 02:13:53,477
That's what I'm
gonna fucking do.

2693
02:13:53,551 --> 02:13:55,792
That's completely uncalled for.

2694
02:13:56,031 --> 02:13:58,637
Really, Jill?
Do you think it is?

2695
02:13:58,911 --> 02:14:02,074
Fuck off, Jill.
God, everybody fucking hates you.

2696
02:14:02,751 --> 02:14:03,752
God!

2697
02:14:03,831 --> 02:14:04,878
That isn't even nice.

2698
02:14:05,031 --> 02:14:08,080
Go suck a big
fucking dick, Jill.

2699
02:14:08,911 --> 02:14:10,322
</font> That's totally uncalled
for, Catherine.

02:14:10,391 --> 02:14:12,678
You're a fucking asshole.
Everybody hates you.

2701
02:14:12,791 --> 02:14:13,952
They hate your fucking bob.

2702
02:14:15,111 --> 02:14:17,273
And I'm glad your husband died.

2703
02:14:17,471 --> 02:14:20,680
Because you're a fucking asshole.
He probably killed himself.

2704
02:14:21,591 --> 02:14:23,593
I would. Kill myself.

2705
02:14:24,391 --> 02:14:26,598
God, I'd kill myself, Jill.

02:14:28,671 --> 02:14:30,639
