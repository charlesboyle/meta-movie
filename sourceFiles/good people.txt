1
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:46,578
Where is he?

2
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:33,358
He's a French dealer selling
a case of liquid heroin.

3
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:39,199
Ben, grab the drugs.
Bobby's at the money.

4
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,102
Me and Marshall will cover you
till you get back to the car.

5
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:43,737
Then we get the fuck out.

6
00:01:43,738 --> 00:01:46,139
So my plan, basically.

7
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,507
You came to me, remember?

8
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:30,515
That's him.

9
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:37,250
Bobby.

10
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,584
Sorry, mate.

11
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,936
Bobby.

12
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,606
Bobby.

13
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,243
Fuck.

14
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,283
Bobby.

15
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:13,086
- Jack.
- Bobby.

16
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:15,488
Bobby is gone, Jack.
We need to leave now.

17
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,256
Come on. Come on, now.

18
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,432
Hi.

19
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,636
Hi, sweetie pie.

20
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,573
How's my beautiful godson?

21
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:09,108
Yes.

22
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,244
Come here.

23
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:14,180
Hi, sweet pie.

24
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,349
I missed you.

25
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,851
You're late. Now I'm
going to be late.

26
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,753
Nice to see you, too.

27
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:24,023
Someone has been crying
his little head off all morning.

28
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:27,827
The bloody washing machine's broken.
I'm having to wash everything in the sink.

29
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:31,030
- Speaking of which...
- Don't push your luck, Mommy.

30
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:35,635
Godmothers babysit, we buy
presents, we don't do laundry.

31
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,904
Someone's very grumpy.

32
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,806
- You got your period?
- No.

33
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:42,875
It's sushi night, actually.

34
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,245
- You're not still doing that, are you?
- Yeah.

35
00:05:45,246 --> 00:05:47,247
You might as well wear
a T-shirt saying,

36
00:05:47,248 --> 00:05:51,184
- "Hi, I'm ovulating. Do you want to fuck?"
- What's the romance in that?

37
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:54,287
Darling, you do know,
if I had the money, I'd...

38
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,923
Well, actually, I'd first go
buy a new washing machine,

39
00:05:56,924 --> 00:06:00,159
but then after that I'd pay
for you to go private.

40
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,827
I'd IVF you a baby.

41
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:06,767
How's Tom?

42
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:10,335
He's just spending every
waking minute at the house.

43
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,840
You're so lucky to have him.

44
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:17,175
And you're so lucky to have him.

45
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,313
Tom. Tom.

46
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,883
You up there?

47
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,722
What you doing? Didn't you hear me?

48
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,227
Job I just finished
had a little extra.

49
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,594
Thought you could use them.

50
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,633
You all right, mate?

51
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:43,369
- I think we're going to lose the house.
- Oh, shit.

52
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,539
- I thought you were coming along.
- Yeah.

53
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,742
Not far enough.

54
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,578
Pumped all the money into it.

55
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:56,681
Half my budget went
into this fucking dry rot.

56
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:01,854
What does Anna say?

57
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:04,023
I haven't told her, yet.

58
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:08,328
She only knows half of what I spent
and she's already freaking out.

59
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:11,798
We're trying to start a family. Can't
even afford the rent on our apartment.

60
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:15,266
Just talk to her, mate.
She'll understand.

61
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:19,304
Come on.

62
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,977
If you're up for it, a friend of mine
needs some painting done next week.

63
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,413
Won't pay much, but...

64
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:30,617
Yeah. Thanks.

65
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:35,455
It's a good thing I have a
Master's degree. Come in handy.

66
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,455
See you, bud.

67
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,470
- Tom Wright?
- Yeah.

68
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,342
You're served.

69
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,714
We've got two weeks?

70
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,684
Thanks.

71
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,900
Ben.

72
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,701
Turn it down.

73
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,983
Hello?

74
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:44,757
Hi.

75
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,791
Hi.

76
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,832
It's, uh, sushi night?

77
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,634
You forgot.

78
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:57,003
No. No.

79
00:08:57,004 --> 00:09:00,606
- I never forget sushi night.
- It's fine.

80
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,176
Nice wine.

81
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:05,845
It was just a few quid extra.

82
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:09,547
- A very nice wine.
- And I thought it was worth it.

83
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,652
Of course it's worth it.

84
00:09:16,457 --> 00:09:18,858
Come here.

85
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,591
Sushi night.

86
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,564
How's Julian?

87
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:28,967
He's... loud and...

88
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,838
- Tonight...
- Yeah?

89
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,172
...someone's going to get pregnant.

90
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,604
Hey.

91
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,575
You okay?

92
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,148
We're going to lose the house.

93
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,489
No.

94
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:29,627
No. We're going to work it out.

95
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,599
Mike just got me a few
days on a good job.

96
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:40,004
- Maybe it's time we go back.
- No.

97
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:42,875
- No.
- Tom.

98
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,842
This was my idea.

99
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,082
I promised you a fresh start.

100
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:54,519
I promised you a place
to start a family.

101
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,755
That was then.

102
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,695
I'm not giving up.

103
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:06,498
So... you can shut up.

104
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,534
Tonight is sushi night.

105
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:11,804
I'm feeling lucky.

106
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,512
Ben.

107
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,960
Ben.

108
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:53,778
No answer.

109
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,950
Tom.

110
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:05,123
Ben?

111
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:10,561
I'm coming down.

112
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,571
Ben.

113
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,584
Ben?

114
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,718
Oh, Tom.

115
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,129
Oh, my God.

116
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,404
I can't believe he was
down here the whole time.

117
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:29,073
Yeah. Right below
where our bedroom is.

118
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,033
- Anna.
- What?

119
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:19,626
Oh, my God, Tom.

120
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:23,395
220,000 pounds.

121
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:26,098
What the hell was Ben
doing with this much cash?

122
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:30,134
What was he doing living in our
basement with all this cash?

123
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:34,774
Well, he was on disability,

124
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:38,644
and maybe he had a big
settlement after an accident?

125
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:43,114
I just don't know why it
wouldn't be in the bank.

126
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,741
So, what do we do?

127
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,880
Hm?

128
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,219
- We call the police.
- Yeah?

129
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,065
- Anna. Anna.
- What?

130
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,934
Wait.

131
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,934
Tom.

132
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,907
- Help me.
- We shouldn't have brought this up here.

133
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:43,442
I know. You want to help me?

134
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,309
- Tom.
- Help me now.

135
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:51,215
I got it. Answer the door.

136
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,757
- Mr. Wright?
- Yes.

137
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:03,027
I'm Detective Inspector John Halden.

138
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,467
So, Mr. Wright,
what-what is it you do?

139
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,837
- He's a landscape architect.
- Oh.

140
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:16,275
Yeah. I used to be, in Chicago.

141
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:19,545
I had a small business,
a little crew,

142
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,547
but it fell apart in the crash,

143
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:24,950
so we moved here for a fresh start.

144
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:29,288
We also had an unfortunate
miscarriage a few years ago, so...

145
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:34,160
- Oh, I'm so sorry. So sorry.
- It was a nice change for us.

146
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:37,396
So, now I-I do contracting work

147
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:40,099
odd jobs and manual labor.

148
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,534
- Why London?
- Tom's renovating a house.

149
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:45,704
My grandmother passed a few years ago

150
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:50,276
and we inherited the family house,
so I thought I'd fix it up.

151
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:53,613
Good for you.

152
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:57,549
So, Mrs. Wright, how are you,
um, how are you liking London?

153
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:03,322
Anna, please. I'm a school teacher
at Morningside Primary School.

154
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:06,025
My wife runs a clinic just
down the street from there.

155
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:09,895
Sterling House? That's a,
uh, women's shelter, right?

156
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:14,266
Yeah. They look after young women with
drug addiction, take them off the streets.

157
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:17,069
The government has withdrawn its
funding, but they're hanging in there.

158
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,306
My wife, Marie,
isn't one for giving up.

159
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,646
Anyhow...

160
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:30,314
So, thank you for the tea.

161
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,919
It was very good.

162
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:39,058
How long have you been
renting the room downstairs?

163
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,427
Uh, not long.

164
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:45,664
I mean, we just did it 'cause
we needed help with the rent.

165
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,666
- Three months, maybe.
- Yeah.

166
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:52,436
And he always paid by cash.
Did you find this odd?

167
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,874
No, not really, no.

168
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,710
Did he, um,

169
00:17:57,711 --> 00:18:00,678
did he have any visitors?

170
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:09,088
Uh, he really kept to himself.
I mean, he didn't have much.

171
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:14,160
- No. He watched a lot of television.
- Yeah, that's true. Very loud.

172
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:19,029
Did, um, did you find
anything unusual about him?

173
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,405
When you, um,

174
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:29,408
when you discovered
the body, did you...

175
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:32,076
Did you find anything else?

176
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,183
- Um...
- No.

177
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:40,753
The reason I ask is because
the initial police report

178
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:43,422
suggests that he died
of a drug overdose,

179
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:45,824
and the team downstairs are
just looking for evidence

180
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,993
that he may have kept drugs there.

181
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:52,129
No, we had... I mean, we had no idea.

182
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,636
Well, it's just, uh...
it's just routine.

183
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,070
For your own safety.

184
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:21,026
<i>...late 40's discovered in
the basement of a flat.</i>

185
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,529
<i>The cause of death is as yet unknown.</i>

186
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,865
<i>His identity is being withheld
until relatives are traced.</i>

187
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:30,401
<i>To the city now, and London's
markets are still not steady.</i>

188
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:39,211
There's a new lead

189
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:43,247
to-to the guys that
gave Julie the drugs.

190
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:46,685
I thought Martin took
you off that case.

191
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,719
Yeah.

192
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:53,657
Is it dangerous?

193
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:58,696
Really dangerous, then.

194
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:04,270
Still not going to bring
her back, John. So...

195
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:07,371
why take the risk?

196
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:13,077
It might save someone
else's daughter.

197
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,417
We'll call Halden in the morning.

198
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:06,630
Tom?

199
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:10,634
Tom?

200
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:37,494
What are you doing?

201
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,075
We spent our whole
lives being good, right?

202
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:54,913
And what has it gotten us? Nothing.

203
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:59,351
So, maybe this money is a gift to
help us get our lives back on track.

204
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:01,719
Tom.

205
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:06,190
We don't know where
this money comes from.

206
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:12,564
This could be really,
really bad money.

207
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,766
I know.

208
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,902
I know.

209
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:20,172
But what makes money bad?

210
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:23,842
Not the money.
The people make it bad.

211
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,178
What people do with it.

212
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,947
Now, I'm not saying
we do anything rash.

213
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:34,353
All I'm saying is we
just wait and see.

214
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:37,256
He's been dead a week.

215
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:40,392
The cops came,
they didn't find anything.

216
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:43,061
No one's come forward
looking for the money.

217
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:45,963
Okay? And if they do,

218
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,833
this will look like Ben hid it.

219
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:54,506
I say we just hide it...

220
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:57,775
and wait a week.

221
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,755
Two weeks.

222
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:15,359
All right.

223
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:22,232
End of the month. And then...

224
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:25,402
nobody comes,

225
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,506
we just find it again.

226
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,825
Halden, where are the background
checks on the Scott case?

227
00:23:49,296 --> 00:23:54,132
You wouldn't be wasting time on the
Witkowski case? I told you to drop it.

228
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:57,402
Nobody gives a shit if Jack
Witkowski killed his twat of a brother.

229
00:23:57,403 --> 00:24:01,440
Another deficient shitsack off the
street is fine with this department.

230
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:05,676
The Scott background checks,
on my desk by five.

231
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:24,930
And this has nothing
to do with Julie?

232
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:27,332
No, no, no, no. It's just...

233
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:30,601
It's just a hunch I
want to follow up on.

234
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:35,874
If I'm going to break every
law I'm here to uphold,

235
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,975
I'd rather it was for a good cause.

236
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,713
Okay.

237
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,751
It has everything to
do with my daughter.

238
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:55,727
Bank accounts, Inland Revenue,
utility bills, mortgage.

239
00:24:55,728 --> 00:25:00,831
From now on, if Thomas or Anna
Wright sneeze, you'll know about it.

240
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:05,570
But I warn you, there's
not much money to follow.

241
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:08,372
No, not at the moment.

242
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,209
Okay.

243
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,379
You'll keep me posted?

244
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,915
If Martin finds out, I'll be fired.

245
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,951
Martin's a smug little prick.

246
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:23,921
Superintendent Tosspot
can go fuck himself.

247
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:44,743
- Detective Halden?
- Yes.

248
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:47,412
Hi, this is Tom Wright from the...

249
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:50,315
- How are you?
- We were just wondering

250
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:54,886
if you heard anything about
the next of kin for Ben Tuttle.

251
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:58,055
No, no, no. We haven't
located any living relatives.

252
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:01,259
I just ask because, uh,

253
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,397
we wanted to know what do with
his things, his clothes and stuff.

254
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:07,664
No, no one's come forward, yet.

255
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:11,470
Okay.

256
00:26:11,471 --> 00:26:15,240
And, uh, do you know,
was it officially...

257
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:19,444
Yeah, overdose.
Looks like it was Liquid O.

258
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:22,180
- What's Liquid O?
- Heroin.

259
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:25,450
I see. Wow.

260
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:28,585
- Okay. Have a good day.
- Bye.

261
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:18,036
You met my little
brother, haven't you?

262
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:20,972
Always tried to let him win.

263
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,775
Any game.

264
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:28,512
Drove Mom crazy. Said Bobby
would never learn if we did that.

265
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:32,849
'Course she was right.

266
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:37,455
Jack and Bobby. How it came to this?

267
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,458
Mom was a fan.

268
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:43,927
She also had high expectations.

269
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:49,766
Where's Cousin Ben?

270
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:58,276
You know, when you recommend a guy,

271
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:01,580
you're tying his name to yours.

272
00:28:01,581 --> 00:28:04,915
Did you know he was going to fuck me?

273
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:09,219
If you tell me where I find him,

274
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:13,290
maybe I'll choose to
believe you on that.

275
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:20,530
Eddie, sir, could I please
trouble you for a pen?

276
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,684
You done the right thing.

277
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:46,024
But that doesn't mean I'm not
going to hold you accountable.

278
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:34,604
- Anna.
- Yeah.

279
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,874
I spent some of the money.

280
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,582
What?

281
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:47,085
The day we found Ben,

282
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:50,989
the landlord gave us
an eviction notice.

283
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,591
I was going to tell you, but you
were in such a good mood,

284
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:56,628
and it was sushi night.

285
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:59,464
And then we found the money, and...

286
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:02,866
I took just enough to keep
the roof over our heads.

287
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:08,640
Look, we're in this.

288
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:12,642
As soon as we put the money in the oven
and we didn't take it out, we were in this.

289
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:18,315
If we don't start paying off the
mortgage, we're going to lose the house.

290
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:24,589
How do we do this?

291
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,325
We spend just enough
to stop the bleeding.

292
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:32,530
We use cash where we can,
and we get Mike to write an invoice.

293
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:34,733
You want to bring Mike into this?

294
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:37,936
No, it's not like that.
We're not bringing him into it.

295
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:42,006
But when I do a job for him,
he usually pays me cash,

296
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,842
and then writes an invoice.

297
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:46,511
So, if anyone asks...

298
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,581
Right, there's a paper trail.

299
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:53,083
What if someone comes
looking for it, Tom?

300
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:58,722
Anna.

301
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:02,494
Nobody's come.

302
00:31:02,495 --> 00:31:04,729
Nobody's going to come.

303
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:09,400
And if they do, who's to
say Ben didn't spend it?

304
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:12,737
How much are we talking?

305
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:15,340
Just enough to stay above water.

306
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:18,042
The mortgage, credit cards.

307
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,977
Just so we're in the clear.

308
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:35,794
There's only one problem
that I can think of.

309
00:31:35,795 --> 00:31:40,598
- What?
- You are going to be really lonely

310
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:43,301
when the debt
collectors stop calling.

311
00:31:56,282 --> 00:32:00,917
Hi, this is Anna Wright. I'm calling
to inquire about an appointment.

312
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:07,891
Yeah, for an IVF
consultation, if possible.

313
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:16,032
Hello.

314
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:41,558
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

315
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:52,203
- Halden.
- It's Duncan.

316
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:54,706
- Yeah, what's up?
- Not much.

317
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:58,142
I'm calling 'cause we got a flag.

318
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,011
- The Americans?
- Yeah.

319
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:02,914
You were right.
A lot of activity today.

320
00:33:02,915 --> 00:33:05,650
Mr. Wright made five
separate payments.

321
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:08,653
I've got deposits to the current
account, mortgage and credit cards.

322
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,456
- Cash?
- Some cash. Some money transfers.

323
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:16,092
He spread it out. No single payment
big enough to raise flags at the bank.

324
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:31,568
Fuck.

325
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:43,247
We found the Liquid O.

326
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:46,317
What about the cash?

327
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:56,686
Mr. Wright?

328
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,360
Detective.

329
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:06,330
It looks like someone came
for Ben's stuff after all.

330
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,865
Yeah.

331
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:10,701
Who do you think would do this?

332
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:13,971
Your tenant crossed a very bad man.

333
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:17,674
That man's name is Jack Witkowski.

334
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:24,614
- So, who called the police?
- No one.

335
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:27,718
I just wanted to talk to you.

336
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,722
Yeah, well, why?

337
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:34,424
Let's go upstairs.

338
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,696
I'm sorry.

339
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:41,032
It's not back there. It's in my car.

340
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:45,470
But I-I-I did just get an
invoice from, um, Mike Calloway.

341
00:36:45,471 --> 00:36:48,840
This Mike Calloway,
he's a friend of yours?

342
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:51,576
He is, but I do a lot
of work with him,

343
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:55,246
and he owed me on two jobs,

344
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:59,951
and we got paid upfront for
this other thing last week.

345
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:04,355
If you're holding anything back,
you better tell me.

346
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:06,691
I don't quite understand.

347
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:10,194
The dead tenant,
Ben Tuttle, drug abuse,

348
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:15,199
sudden activity in your bank account,
and now, coincidentally, a break-in.

349
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,402
I don't want to accuse
you of anything.

350
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,872
I just want to clarify things.

351
00:37:20,873 --> 00:37:23,274
You're welcome.

352
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:27,577
Hey.

353
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:29,914
Hey. Ouch.

354
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:33,216
Sorry, I have to take this.

355
00:37:36,155 --> 00:37:40,258
Would you do me a favor and please
don't mention the break-in to my wife?

356
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:43,962
She's been a little
rattled since Ben died.

357
00:37:43,963 --> 00:37:46,602
No, really, it's fine. Tom finally
got paid on that big job...

358
00:37:46,603 --> 00:37:51,769
- I was telling you about.
- Oh, my God. I can't believe that.

359
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,071
Oh, no, that's too much.

360
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:57,106
Sarah, I got to go. Okay, bye.

361
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:02,747
So, this Mike Calloway,
he pays you in cash?

362
00:38:02,748 --> 00:38:06,584
Sorry, what are you implying?

363
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:09,020
I'm implying nothing.

364
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:12,256
I was inquiring about the deposit,
and your husband cleared it up.

365
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:15,658
So, all's good.

366
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:30,707
The worst part is
behind us, right, baby?

367
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:38,514
Yeah.

368
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,718
It's all good.

369
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:18,923
- Yo.
- Hey.

370
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:21,058
- Bloody hell.
- What?

371
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:24,796
- Quality stuff.
- Yeah.

372
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:28,965
I thought you said you were
going to lose your house.

373
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:32,803
- Mike.
- Yeah.

374
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:35,940
Can I tell you something?

375
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:40,209
Hang on.

376
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,883
This is Tom Wright.

377
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:50,486
Sure. What kind of job?

378
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:54,357
Okay, I'm interested.

379
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:59,762
Yeah, I'll come by with my partner.

380
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,335
Fine, I'll come alone.

381
00:40:04,336 --> 00:40:07,036
Okay. See you then.

382
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:12,310
Looks like we might have another job.

383
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:17,379
French guy, bought a
big house in Notting Hill.

384
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:35,233
- Mr. Wright.
- Hi.

385
00:40:35,234 --> 00:40:37,768
- Please take a seat.
- Thanks.

386
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:41,039
You can call me Tom. You're mister...

387
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,941
You must forgive me.
English is not my first language.

388
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,076
Okay.

389
00:40:45,077 --> 00:40:47,245
- And you, you're American, yes?
- I am.

390
00:40:47,246 --> 00:40:52,750
I live here now. And you,
you just moved to the area?

391
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:56,419
I'm expanding my empire.

392
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:02,593
Tell me, Mr. Wright,
are you a team player?

393
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:05,661
I-I guess.

394
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:13,003
Do you want to talk about
the renovations, mister...

395
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:15,438
Genghis Khan.

396
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:19,143
Genghis Khan? Is that what you said?

397
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,745
Do you know this man?

398
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:24,014
Uh, Genghis Khan, yeah.

399
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:28,452
- I mean, I've heard of him...
- He marched all over the world.

400
00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:30,655
Countries were so afraid of this man,

401
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:34,959
they would lay down their arms
when they heard of his approach.

402
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,727
Do you know what happened
when they did that?

403
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:42,900
- No, I don't know.
- Nothing.

404
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:45,169
Nothing happened.

405
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:50,674
The Great Khan welcomed them
into his kingdom with open arms.

406
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:53,111
But those that resisted,

407
00:41:53,112 --> 00:41:56,147
felt his full fury.

408
00:41:56,148 --> 00:41:59,183
He burned the cities, killed the men,

409
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:03,252
raped their women,
salted their crops.

410
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:09,759
Okay.

411
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,029
Um...

412
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,400
I'm sorry, I... I think I'm probably
not the right guy for this,

413
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:19,637
so maybe you should get someone
else for the renovations, okay?

414
00:42:19,638 --> 00:42:23,274
Recently, a group of
men stole from me.

415
00:42:23,275 --> 00:42:26,844
Where I come from,
this would not happen.

416
00:42:26,845 --> 00:42:30,546
But I'm new here, so...

417
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:34,718
It's not the product that matters,

418
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,288
it's a question of honor.

419
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:42,360
So now I'm burning cities,
I'm salting crops.

420
00:42:42,361 --> 00:42:45,528
And you have housed my enemy.

421
00:42:46,532 --> 00:42:49,533
Ben Tuttle.

422
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:52,536
Oh, I see.

423
00:42:52,537 --> 00:42:56,505
- Okay, yes...
- Have you heard of Jack Witkowski?

424
00:42:58,143 --> 00:43:00,411
This man dishonored me.

425
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:06,015
So, here's my question for you
and your lovely wife, Anna.

426
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:10,321
Are you team players?

427
00:43:10,722 --> 00:43:14,457
- What do you mean?
- Whose team are you on?

428
00:43:15,794 --> 00:43:19,930
- I'm not on anybody's team.
- If you're not on anybody's team,

429
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:23,234
you are not on my team.

430
00:43:23,235 --> 00:43:27,837
So, whose team are you on?

431
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:33,244
Detective Halden, it's Tom Wright.

432
00:43:33,245 --> 00:43:35,344
I need your help.

433
00:43:36,882 --> 00:43:38,748
Babe, it's me. Can you give me...

434
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:46,322
Where's my money?

435
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:50,761
Where's my money?

436
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:53,563
I don't know what
you're talking about.

437
00:43:59,571 --> 00:44:03,940
Me and my brother's money.
Are you an idiot, you fucking cunt?

438
00:44:05,444 --> 00:44:08,044
And he died getting it.

439
00:44:09,281 --> 00:44:12,315
So, you can understand
me wanting it back.

440
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:15,019
Now, where is it?

441
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,453
I don't know.

442
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:21,390
Please.

443
00:44:26,932 --> 00:44:28,999
Please.

444
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,834
Where's the money?

445
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,600
So, that's how you want to play.

446
00:45:03,902 --> 00:45:05,868
It's fine with me.

447
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:37,500
I didn't want to go this far.

448
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,107
Please...

449
00:45:43,108 --> 00:45:45,543
Please, stop. Please.

450
00:45:45,544 --> 00:45:47,578
Where's my money?

451
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:49,680
- Please.
- Where's is it?

452
00:45:49,681 --> 00:45:51,814
Please stop.

453
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:59,522
Where's my money?

454
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,662
Fuck!

455
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:12,136
Hm.

456
00:46:30,956 --> 00:46:32,688
Anna.

457
00:46:34,726 --> 00:46:36,994
Anna, no.

458
00:46:36,995 --> 00:46:39,229
Welcome home, Mrs. Tommy.

459
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,698
Tom.

460
00:46:40,699 --> 00:46:43,933
The police are coming. Just stall.

461
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:46,969
I'm okay.

462
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,140
Oh, my God.

463
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:52,808
That's enough.

464
00:46:55,714 --> 00:46:57,915
Get up.

465
00:46:57,916 --> 00:46:59,949
Up!

466
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:17,166
This is what Tommy has.

467
00:47:18,937 --> 00:47:22,106
Didn't you know?
When you find a pot of gold,

468
00:47:22,107 --> 00:47:25,776
there's always a monster guarding it.

469
00:47:25,777 --> 00:47:28,110
You smell so nice.

470
00:47:31,716 --> 00:47:33,918
Just relax.

471
00:47:33,919 --> 00:47:36,520
Stop. It's downstairs.

472
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:40,157
Bullshit. I looked all over.

473
00:47:40,158 --> 00:47:42,493
It's in the window frame.

474
00:47:42,494 --> 00:47:46,028
I hid it in the window frame.

475
00:48:16,194 --> 00:48:18,661
Tom's lying.

476
00:48:28,773 --> 00:48:32,074
He's afraid that if he gives you
the money, you're going to kill us.

477
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,562
Fuck.

478
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:58,534
Where's the fucking money?

479
00:49:00,238 --> 00:49:03,105
Promise me you won't kill us.

480
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:08,277
No.

481
00:49:09,681 --> 00:49:12,916
One, two...

482
00:49:15,053 --> 00:49:19,156
Stop pissing about. Which one?

483
00:49:19,157 --> 00:49:23,292
Three, four, five.

484
00:49:25,764 --> 00:49:29,598
This one. It's this one.

485
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:37,074
Oh, fuck!

486
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:41,912
- We're in here.
- Downstairs. He's downstairs.

487
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:07,171
You're in serious trouble,
Mr. and Mrs. Wright.

488
00:50:07,172 --> 00:50:11,040
You stole some money
and you spent it,

489
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:14,877
so you're going to prison.

490
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:21,185
- Do we need to get a lawyer?
- A lawyer won't change that.

491
00:50:21,186 --> 00:50:25,421
Turning it in won't change it
unless you can turn all of it in.

492
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:28,892
No, I didn't think so.

493
00:50:28,893 --> 00:50:32,830
And Jack Witkowski isn't the kind
of guy to forgive and forget.

494
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:36,366
He'd find a way to get to you before
we could even bring you to trial.

495
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,768
I've tried to arrest
him for two years.

496
00:50:40,505 --> 00:50:45,409
He's got ties to the police. Someone
who turns a blind eye to what he does.

497
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:50,347
There are some people in Scotland Yard
that think that Jack is doing us a service.

498
00:50:50,348 --> 00:50:52,983
He kills his fair
share of bad people.

499
00:50:52,984 --> 00:50:56,253
They believe that one in the
hand is worth five in the street.

500
00:50:56,254 --> 00:50:59,455
Think they can... control him.

501
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:03,994
But you don't.

502
00:51:03,995 --> 00:51:10,300
After he's paid off whichever fucking
corrupt coppers are protecting him,

503
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:13,970
he sells his stuff on
the street at cut price.

504
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:18,475
He targets young women, single mums,

505
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:22,478
people he thinks he can control.

506
00:51:24,015 --> 00:51:26,949
That's his specialty.

507
00:51:31,356 --> 00:51:33,956
There is a way out of it.

508
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:40,229
- What?
- You help me, I'll help you.

509
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:45,769
When Jack comes
after you, we set a trap.

510
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:48,906
- How?
- You say he took your phone.

511
00:51:48,907 --> 00:51:51,441
- Yeah.
- When he calls,

512
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:54,478
you agree to take the money to him.

513
00:51:54,479 --> 00:51:57,681
You want to use us as bait?

514
00:51:57,682 --> 00:51:59,349
No.

515
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:02,052
- All right, wait... just...
- No.

516
00:52:02,053 --> 00:52:05,165
Just... If we-if we do it,
that means we walk.

517
00:52:05,166 --> 00:52:08,231
This doesn't go in the books.
If I took this to headquarters,

518
00:52:08,232 --> 00:52:12,661
Jack would get wind of it, I'd be out
of a job, you two would be dead.

519
00:52:16,067 --> 00:52:18,467
Find somewhere safe for tonight.

520
00:52:51,436 --> 00:52:53,437
Tom.

521
00:52:53,438 --> 00:52:56,040
Tom.

522
00:52:56,741 --> 00:52:59,176
You know he would've
killed you, right?

523
00:52:59,177 --> 00:53:03,347
You told me to stall. You told
me the police were coming.

524
00:53:03,348 --> 00:53:07,885
Before. Why didn't you just
show him where the money was?

525
00:53:07,886 --> 00:53:10,387
Why didn't you tell me
somebody broke into our house.

526
00:53:10,388 --> 00:53:14,024
I just wanted us to have a little
money so we wouldn't get evicted,

527
00:53:14,025 --> 00:53:16,226
- so we could have...
- Shut up!

528
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:18,594
So we could have a life.

529
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:36,980
I went to the fertility clinic,

530
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:40,983
and I spent some of the money.

531
00:53:42,253 --> 00:53:46,488
I'm sorry. I feel so stupid.

532
00:53:49,027 --> 00:53:50,727
It's okay.

533
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:53,397
Something was wrong with me.

534
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:55,232
I just...

535
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:57,533
It's okay.

536
00:53:58,336 --> 00:54:01,970
Come here. Come here.

537
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:07,443
All we wanted was a family.

538
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:17,386
It's him.

539
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,560
Hello?

540
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:25,995
Knock, knock. Room service.

541
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:32,202
So, where have you put it?
In the hotel safe or under the bed?

542
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:36,238
How can you fuck on
that dirty mattress?

543
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:40,909
People like you are so
predictable, Tommy.

544
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,049
All right, you can have your money.
Just leave us alone.

545
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:51,054
- I want to see you and the money.
- When? Where?

546
00:54:51,055 --> 00:54:52,990
It needs to be in
public for my safety.

547
00:54:52,991 --> 00:54:56,827
Tomorrow, noon,
Victoria Park by the pond.

548
00:54:56,828 --> 00:54:59,662
And then you leave us alone.

549
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:04,233
What now?

550
00:55:10,575 --> 00:55:13,877
The, um, the tracking device
is sewn into the seam.

551
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:17,948
It's virtually undetectable,
and I can track you on my phone.

552
00:55:17,949 --> 00:55:21,251
As soon as you see him,
put the bag down and walk away.

553
00:55:21,252 --> 00:55:25,222
Don't run, don't look back.
No exceptions, no heroics, no nothing.

554
00:55:25,223 --> 00:55:27,290
Just drop and go.

555
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:31,061
And when we're gone,
you'll arrest him?

556
00:55:31,062 --> 00:55:32,963
Yes, as soon as he picks
up the bag, it's over,

557
00:55:32,964 --> 00:55:37,467
by which time you'll be gone and safe.
You'll be under constant supervision.

558
00:55:37,468 --> 00:55:40,337
My men will be watching you,
but you won't see them.

559
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:42,172
All right.

560
00:55:42,173 --> 00:55:44,406
Drop and go.

561
00:55:46,978 --> 00:55:49,011
Okay.

562
00:55:56,454 --> 00:56:01,023
- He's going to get us killed.
- Not if we have back-up.

563
00:56:10,635 --> 00:56:13,603
<i>Bonjour. Enchantée.</i>

564
00:56:13,604 --> 00:56:15,973
You must be Anna.

565
00:56:16,574 --> 00:56:20,544
I take it Jack Witkowski
paid you a visit.

566
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:22,379
Yeah.

567
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,981
So, tell me, Mr. and Mrs. Wright,

568
00:56:24,982 --> 00:56:28,784
what is the plan you want
to speak to me about?

569
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19,603
Where is he?

570
00:57:19,804 --> 00:57:22,204
He'll call us.

571
00:57:51,569 --> 00:57:54,504
Where are you? You're late.

572
00:57:54,505 --> 00:57:58,909
Tell me, Tommy, why are our good
friends from the Met joining us?

573
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:01,211
Don't worry about him.
He's not with us.

574
00:58:01,212 --> 00:58:03,413
Just let him walk by and
you can have your money.

575
00:58:03,414 --> 00:58:06,683
I'm not talking about that one,
you tosser. He works for me.

576
00:58:06,684 --> 00:58:09,286
Wave to the good people, Marshall.

577
00:58:09,287 --> 00:58:11,888
I'm talking about that
mangy fuck, Halden.

578
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:17,693
- Run.
- Drop the bag.

579
00:58:20,898 --> 00:58:24,833
Fuck. Marshall, you fucking dick,
get the fucking money.

580
00:58:32,443 --> 00:58:34,477
Drop the bag, Tom.

581
00:58:36,314 --> 00:58:37,948
Drop the bag.

582
00:58:37,949 --> 00:58:40,449
- Drop the bag.
- Run.

583
00:58:40,918 --> 00:58:43,285
Anna, run.

584
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:58,468
Why didn't you just drop the money?

585
00:58:58,469 --> 00:59:02,404
'Cause the money's the only
thing keeping us alive right now.

586
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:09,879
- Halden is dead.
- I know.

587
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,948
- They killed him.
- I know.

588
00:59:14,118 --> 00:59:16,451
Anna.

589
00:59:31,469 --> 00:59:33,902
What are we going to do, Tom?

590
00:59:35,206 --> 00:59:37,140
Where are we going to go?

591
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:40,110
We have one place where we can go.

592
00:59:40,111 --> 00:59:42,978
At least for a few hours.

593
00:59:49,787 --> 00:59:53,056
You broke your word. Do you
think I would let you play me?

594
00:59:53,057 --> 00:59:54,791
I'm not trying to play you, Khan.

595
00:59:54,792 --> 00:59:59,995
When I find you, just remember,
you brought this on yourselves.

596
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:20,415
Would you mind giving us a
minute in private, Mrs. Halden?

597
01:00:26,958 --> 01:00:29,958
Yeah, I was going to
grab a coffee anyway.

598
01:00:33,164 --> 01:00:35,165
What in God's name were you thinking?

599
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:38,034
Not only were you wearing
a bulletproof vest,

600
01:00:38,035 --> 01:00:40,236
but you took a firearm
into a public park.

601
01:00:40,237 --> 01:00:43,371
There are children there,
for Christ's sake.

602
01:00:45,009 --> 01:00:50,512
You're an embarrassment. You should've
retired when your junkie daughter died.

603
01:00:52,183 --> 01:00:55,185
Excuse me, sir.
Mr. Halden needs to rest.

604
01:00:55,186 --> 01:00:57,687
Okay, my apologies.

605
01:00:57,688 --> 01:01:00,157
You rest up, John.

606
01:01:00,758 --> 01:01:04,627
Good news for me is... now I
don't have to pay your pension.

607
01:01:04,628 --> 01:01:07,230
Who's going to pay your pension, Ray?

608
01:01:07,231 --> 01:01:11,833
Scotland Yard or guys
like Jack Witkowski?

609
01:01:48,472 --> 01:01:52,574
I wanted to fix the floor
before I showed it to you.

610
01:01:57,148 --> 01:02:00,982
It's a little different upstairs.
You want to see?

611
01:02:01,752 --> 01:02:03,718
Yeah.

612
01:02:07,425 --> 01:02:12,928
Remember when we started working on the
house and we'd eat take-away on the floor?

613
01:02:14,465 --> 01:02:16,531
Yeah.

614
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:23,573
Remember when I thought
I'd be done in four months?

615
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:27,409
Remember when I thought
I'd be pregnant in six?

616
01:02:33,918 --> 01:02:36,885
I'm sorry I stopped coming here.

617
01:02:39,356 --> 01:02:42,824
I'm sorry I got lost in this place.

618
01:02:43,861 --> 01:02:46,695
I never needed the house, Tom.

619
01:02:48,032 --> 01:02:50,799
All I needed was us.

620
01:02:52,736 --> 01:02:54,836
I know.

621
01:03:27,071 --> 01:03:29,471
We're going to make it.

622
01:03:30,608 --> 01:03:33,341
Tell me we're going to make it.

623
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:55,864
It's okay, Boo-boo. I'm coming.

624
01:03:57,234 --> 01:03:59,335
Give me your phone.

625
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:02,170
Give me your phone.

626
01:04:15,986 --> 01:04:17,620
Sarah?

627
01:04:17,621 --> 01:04:21,056
You smell so lovely.

628
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:26,896
Julian's a real peach.

629
01:04:26,897 --> 01:04:29,299
Hello?

630
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:33,803
You want kids, don't you,
Tommy? Me, too.

631
01:04:33,804 --> 01:04:36,472
Such a precious gift.

632
01:04:36,473 --> 01:04:39,808
So, hurting little Julian...

633
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:44,181
it's not going to be easy for me.

634
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:47,215
He's so smooth.

635
01:04:50,354 --> 01:04:53,188
What's your plan, Tommy?

636
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:57,591
What's your plan, Tommy?

637
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:07,068
We can't go out. After the park,
the police are looking for us, too.

638
01:05:12,743 --> 01:05:17,080
We're hiding out in an old
house in West London.

639
01:05:17,081 --> 01:05:19,547
I'll text you the address...

640
01:05:20,651 --> 01:05:23,184
and you come meet us here.

641
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:26,154
Okay?

642
01:05:27,725 --> 01:05:29,591
No more tricks.

643
01:05:33,397 --> 01:05:35,830
Keep fucking quiet.

644
01:05:56,987 --> 01:05:59,254
Better text Khan.

645
01:06:00,858 --> 01:06:03,024
Yeah.

646
01:06:04,361 --> 01:06:06,796
You really think he's going to come?

647
01:06:06,797 --> 01:06:08,999
Yeah.

648
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,734
It's all about honor with that guy.

649
01:06:15,739 --> 01:06:17,606
Sent.

650
01:06:20,778 --> 01:06:23,845
You know they're going
to have guns, right?

651
01:06:27,818 --> 01:06:30,385
Guns are for pussies.

652
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:15,298
Yeah.

653
01:07:15,299 --> 01:07:17,699
Look who's come for dinner.

654
01:07:18,669 --> 01:07:21,336
Anna?

655
01:07:22,873 --> 01:07:24,973
Get ready.

656
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:32,949
This is the perfect place.

657
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:34,916
For what?

658
01:07:53,337 --> 01:07:55,505
I see no cash.

659
01:07:55,506 --> 01:07:59,041
It's in the house. Safe.

660
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:00,810
Don't fuck with me.

661
01:08:00,811 --> 01:08:03,012
Jack, you can have the money

662
01:08:03,013 --> 01:08:06,881
just as soon as we get
Sarah and Julian.

663
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:21,930
- Where's Mrs. Tommy?
- She's inside, with the money.

664
01:08:38,348 --> 01:08:39,749
What the fuck.

665
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:42,850
Honey, I'm home.

666
01:08:49,693 --> 01:08:51,227
Mrs. Tommy.

667
01:08:55,232 --> 01:08:59,101
You got five seconds to show me the
money or I'm shooting your husband.

668
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:03,938
- The money's up here.
- How can I be sure?

669
01:09:08,879 --> 01:09:11,981
I just want Sarah, I want Julian,

670
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:17,553
but if you hurt them or my
husband, I will destroy all of it.

671
01:09:17,554 --> 01:09:21,489
That's impressive.
I'll get them over.

672
01:09:32,135 --> 01:09:34,035
Get the fuck out, love.

673
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:40,541
Now it's your turn.

674
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:02,198
Well done, sweetheart.

675
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:04,365
Now the bag.

676
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:25,285
Jack?

677
01:10:36,299 --> 01:10:38,733
Are you all right?

678
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:48,509
Sarah!

679
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:53,616
Sarah!

680
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:08,965
Go out the ladder.

681
01:11:09,466 --> 01:11:11,934
Sarah, go out the ladder.

682
01:12:25,642 --> 01:12:28,843
- Oh, God.
- Give me Julian. Give me Julian

683
01:15:59,989 --> 01:16:01,755
Andre?

684
01:17:42,926 --> 01:17:45,860
You betrayed me, Mr. Wright.

685
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:49,665
You cannot undo that.

686
01:17:49,666 --> 01:17:53,367
You must be sacrificed
<i>pour le bien de tous.</i>

687
01:17:58,508 --> 01:18:00,875
The greater good.

688
01:18:25,435 --> 01:18:27,436
Does not seem fair.

689
01:18:27,437 --> 01:18:31,906
You are playing with toys while
I am not playing at all.

690
01:19:07,042 --> 01:19:09,910
You are a worthy adversary.

691
01:19:18,621 --> 01:19:20,554
Ahh!

692
01:19:27,397 --> 01:19:29,029
Anna.

693
01:19:31,734 --> 01:19:33,434
Anna.

694
01:19:43,146 --> 01:19:44,979
Anna.

695
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:24,820
<i>Metro Police today
announced a breakthrough</i>

696
01:20:24,821 --> 01:20:29,525
<i>in a case that's traumatized people living
in the sleepy London suburb of Mortlake.</i>

697
01:20:29,526 --> 01:20:34,029
<i>It comes just 36 hours after a
shootout which left five people dead</i>

698
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:39,368
<i>a house burnt to the ground,
and the entire community in shock.</i>

699
01:20:39,369 --> 01:20:43,238
<i>With me is Superintendent Ray Martin,
one of the officers in charge of the case.</i>

700
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:45,541
<i>Superintendent, what can you tell us?</i>

701
01:20:45,542 --> 01:20:50,779
<i>We can now confirm that these tragic events
are directly linked to a drug turf war</i>

702
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:55,217
<i>which began with an armed robbery that
turned deadly in an East End night club....</i>

703
01:20:55,218 --> 01:20:58,120
- Remarkable.
- Hi.

704
01:20:58,621 --> 01:21:03,125
<i>...police work and extraordinary bravery
of veteran detective John Halden</i>

705
01:21:03,126 --> 01:21:06,562
<i>a man I consider to be a
personal friend and a colleague.</i>

706
01:21:06,563 --> 01:21:10,364
It's easy to be a hero when
you're writing your own story.

707
01:21:12,735 --> 01:21:16,438
Uh, the firemen found this.

708
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:18,538
It's, um...

709
01:21:19,242 --> 01:21:23,043
It's not much, but, uh, it's yours.

710
01:21:32,455 --> 01:21:34,621
Good luck.

711
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:44,231
Hm.

712
01:21:55,278 --> 01:21:59,214
- What took you so long?
- I just had to do one last thing.

713
01:21:59,215 --> 01:22:02,683
All right. Say goodbye
to this hell hole.

714
01:22:05,088 --> 01:22:07,054
Come on.

715
01:22:18,935 --> 01:22:22,202
So, no more sushi nights.
