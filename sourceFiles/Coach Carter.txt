1
00:01:18,283 --> 00:01:21,309
St. Francis High School
basketball phenom, Ty Crane...

2
00:01:21,419 --> 00:01:22,977
who they recruited just last year...

3
00:01:23,088 --> 00:01:25,556
is widely held
as the next LeBron James.

4
00:01:25,657 --> 00:01:27,818
We simply know him as "The Crane."

5
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:30,717
Come on.

6
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:04,891
Little help here. Pick him up.

7
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:12,361
- Hey, son.
- Hey.

8
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,131
Right here.

9
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,470
Blue ball!

10
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:20,602
What the hell are you doing, y'all?

11
00:02:20,712 --> 00:02:21,906
You took three steps this way.

12
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:24,140
I put my fist up.
That means I'm going this way.

13
00:02:24,249 --> 00:02:26,080
Homey, look where
you're throwing the ball.

14
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:28,786
- Just get your man.
- I knew it.

15
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,222
St. Francis is up by 22.

16
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:48,967
- Stay out of my way, bitch. I own you.
- Hell, no.

17
00:02:49,074 --> 00:02:50,132
Bitch!

18
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:51,708
Let's go.

19
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,601
No. Come on, guys, stop that.

20
00:02:57,749 --> 00:02:59,046
Let me go!

21
00:03:01,553 --> 00:03:03,077
I'm good. Get off me.

22
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,790
That's it. Game's over.

23
00:03:09,928 --> 00:03:11,793
- Crane. Great game.
- Thanks.

24
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:15,730
Tell everyone out there what it feels like
to be the next LeBron James.

25
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:19,496
LeBron James? I'm the only Ty Crane.

26
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:25,005
All right, you heard it here first,
the only Ty Crane.

27
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,970
Why do all the benchwarmers
always got something to say?

28
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,774
We're watching the damn game,
that's why.

29
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:31,314
- You got a good view?
- Yeah.

30
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,646
Ty Crane outscored our whole team
by himself.

31
00:03:33,752 --> 00:03:37,051
- Wonder how that happened.
- We had 32 points. I got 12 of them.

32
00:03:37,155 --> 00:03:39,055
- What did you get, Kenyon?
- Shut up, dog.

33
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:41,921
The Crane swooped down
and delivered a basket of beat-down.

34
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:45,120
He clowned you, dog.
He had you on lock the whole game.

35
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,324
Lyle, why don't you shut your mouth
before I close it for good.

36
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:50,162
You didn't do shit either,
the whole game.

37
00:03:50,268 --> 00:03:52,031
I will slap the taste out of your mouth.

38
00:03:52,137 --> 00:03:53,297
Can we all just get along?

39
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:55,566
Shut your little ass up.
You didn't even play.

40
00:03:55,673 --> 00:03:57,470
Shay, pass me the ball, dog.

41
00:03:57,575 --> 00:04:00,874
You got two points in 16 minutes,
that's why Coach got rid of your ass.

42
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:04,107
Timo, you was in the whole time,
you never even touched the rock.

43
00:04:04,215 --> 00:04:07,275
- You didn't do shit. You might as well...
- Who were you passing to?

44
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:10,115
You were playing
and you didn't even do shit.

45
00:04:15,894 --> 00:04:17,384
Kenny Ray Carter...

46
00:04:17,495 --> 00:04:20,328
Richmond High School,
all-American, 1972.

47
00:04:20,432 --> 00:04:21,490
Good to see you, sir.

48
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:24,329
I was really happy to see you
in the stands tonight.

49
00:04:24,436 --> 00:04:27,872
I have to tell you, sir,
I haven't made up my mind yet.

50
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,973
As I've told you,
it's time for me to step down.

51
00:04:32,076 --> 00:04:34,340
Last few years have been really tough.

52
00:04:34,546 --> 00:04:36,844
Well, losing is hard, sir.

53
00:04:37,782 --> 00:04:40,342
This isn't about losing games, Kenny.

54
00:04:41,953 --> 00:04:45,582
I can't get them to show up for school,
for practice.

55
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:49,320
I can't get parents involved.
And I'm done chasing kids...

56
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:52,294
in the streets
and pulling them into the gym.

57
00:04:52,397 --> 00:04:55,662
- It's a tough job.
- Richmond is a tough little city.

58
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:59,264
When I saw you here tonight,
I thought, "I got him, he's in."

59
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,533
Well, actually,
I was here for another reason.

60
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,370
My son plays for St. Francis.

61
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,536
He does? Which kid was he?

62
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,013
Well, you didn't see him.
He's a freshman. He didn't play.

63
00:05:12,283 --> 00:05:14,342
That's great. Great school.

64
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:16,414
What, you wanna go?

65
00:05:20,158 --> 00:05:21,853
- Lyle, bring it.
- Let him go.

66
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,622
You think everybody's scared of you?
I ain't scared of you.

67
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:28,529
Cruz, chill, man.
Why do you try to act hard all the time?

68
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:31,258
God, I'm sick of you, man!

69
00:05:33,705 --> 00:05:36,173
You know, that school was rough
when I went there.

70
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:37,969
It's way beyond that now.

71
00:05:39,143 --> 00:05:42,237
Then just forget about it.
Don't even discuss it again.

72
00:05:42,347 --> 00:05:43,939
I can't quite do that.

73
00:05:44,048 --> 00:05:47,506
Coach officially offered me
the job tonight. The clock's ticking.

74
00:05:47,619 --> 00:05:50,452
When you say "offer" and "job,"
there's usually money involved.

75
00:05:50,555 --> 00:05:53,752
Yeah. There might be
$1,000 in it for me.

76
00:05:53,858 --> 00:05:55,792
For five months of work?

77
00:05:56,628 --> 00:05:58,596
You can't say no to that.

78
00:05:58,696 --> 00:06:01,028
And the team, it's so bad.

79
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:04,364
Those boys,
they're so angry and undisciplined.

80
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:06,733
And besides,
you know you don't have the time.

81
00:06:06,838 --> 00:06:08,533
You're trying to open up a second store.

82
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,699
Exactly. I don't have any time.

83
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:13,106
You promised to take your girlfriend
to Mexico in January.

84
00:06:13,211 --> 00:06:14,940
And I'm definitely keeping that promise.

85
00:06:15,046 --> 00:06:18,675
There's no way I'm not going to Mexico
and hanging out on the beach...

86
00:06:18,783 --> 00:06:21,877
with you in your bikini.
I can't take that job.

87
00:06:23,054 --> 00:06:24,681
So when do you start?

88
00:06:29,294 --> 00:06:30,784
You should've spoken to me first.

89
00:06:30,895 --> 00:06:33,329
Why? It was a personal choice for me.

90
00:06:33,431 --> 00:06:36,628
So, what happens to me?
You still gonna come to my games?

91
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:39,635
I'll probably miss most of your games,
Damien. I'm sorry.

92
00:06:39,737 --> 00:06:42,570
- I'll go to Richmond and play for you.
- No.

93
00:06:42,974 --> 00:06:46,876
Why not?
Dad, you've always been my coach.

94
00:06:47,111 --> 00:06:49,705
This is a great school, Damien.

95
00:06:49,814 --> 00:06:51,782
It puts you in a great position
for college.

96
00:06:51,883 --> 00:06:53,180
Dad, I'm a freshman!

97
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:54,945
Just because I'm coaching
at Richmond...

98
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:58,079
it doesn't change our plans
for your future, all right?

99
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,425
- Did you bring your ID with you?
- I forgot it.

100
00:07:44,535 --> 00:07:46,935
- Every day.
- Good morning.

101
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:49,003
Ken Carter.

102
00:07:51,976 --> 00:07:53,341
Thank you, sir.

103
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:57,379
What's up?

104
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:04,019
- Nice to see you again, Mr. Carter.
- You too, ma'am.

105
00:08:04,422 --> 00:08:08,518
If the offer still stands,
I'd like to coach the team.

106
00:08:10,328 --> 00:08:14,287
Well, I hope you're up for the task.
These young men need discipline.

107
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,732
The job comes with a $1,500 stipend
and a major time commitment...

108
00:08:17,835 --> 00:08:19,530
for the next four months.

109
00:08:20,638 --> 00:08:22,629
- I accept.
- Great.

110
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:25,771
We're thrilled to have you.
Gentlemen, I hate to be abrupt...

111
00:08:25,877 --> 00:08:28,038
but I do have a budget meeting
I need to run to.

112
00:08:28,312 --> 00:08:30,473
Mr. Carter, is there anything you need
from us?

113
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:34,847
I just need about 25 copies
of this document.

114
00:08:36,554 --> 00:08:40,115
- I'm all set.
- Ray, would you see that Mr. Carter...

115
00:08:40,224 --> 00:08:42,784
- Coach Carter gets these copies?
- Will do.

116
00:08:42,894 --> 00:08:44,156
Gentlemen.

117
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:48,897
I'm not saying
this is not gonna be a challenge...

118
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,468
but, Kenny, you know the deal here.

119
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:54,436
Just keep in mind, these are good boys.

120
00:08:55,006 --> 00:08:57,372
Guys!

121
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:02,178
Now, as you know, I've been... Hey!

122
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:04,581
You know I've been looking
for a new coach...

123
00:09:04,682 --> 00:09:06,980
to take over for me this season.

124
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:10,253
This is Ken Carter.
He went to Richmond.

125
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:12,919
He was a two-sport all-American.

126
00:09:13,324 --> 00:09:16,589
Still holds records
for scoring, assists, steals.

127
00:09:16,694 --> 00:09:19,788
A basketball scholarship
to George Mason University.

128
00:09:20,398 --> 00:09:22,593
We're lucky to have Coach Carter.

129
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,396
Now, let's give him the respect
he's due.

130
00:09:26,003 --> 00:09:28,699
- They're all yours, Coach.
- Thank you, sir.

131
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:35,208
Good afternoon, young men.
As Coach White said...

132
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:38,177
I'm your new basketball coach,
Ken Carter.

133
00:09:39,517 --> 00:09:41,712
I guess I need to speak louder
so you can hear me.

134
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:44,310
I'm Ken Carter,
your new basketball coach.

135
00:09:44,422 --> 00:09:47,255
We hear you, dog. But we can't see you.

136
00:09:47,892 --> 00:09:50,622
The glare from your big, black-ass head
is hella shiny, man.

137
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:53,094
- Damn, do you buff it?
- You got jokes to go along...

138
00:09:53,197 --> 00:09:55,290
with that ugly jump shot of yours?

139
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:59,999
First of all,
if you need to know my credentials...

140
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:03,699
as Coach White said,
they're on the wall there behind you.

141
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:07,335
Secondly, if basketball practice starts
at 3:00...

142
00:10:07,545 --> 00:10:09,775
you are late as of 2:55.

143
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:14,848
You, shooting the ball.
What's your name, sir?

144
00:10:15,219 --> 00:10:17,710
Jason Lyle. But I ain't no sir.

145
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:21,916
You're not a sir.
Well, are you a madam?

146
00:10:23,127 --> 00:10:24,492
Little bitch.

147
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:27,564
As of now, you are a sir.

148
00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:31,726
So are the rest of you.
"Sir" is a term of respect.

149
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,637
And you will have my respect
until you abuse it.

150
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:39,899
Mr. Lyle, how many games
did you guys win last season?

151
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:44,609
- Like four wins, 22 losses.
- Sir.

152
00:10:45,316 --> 00:10:46,476
Sir.

153
00:10:48,753 --> 00:10:51,051
I'm going to give you contracts.

154
00:10:53,057 --> 00:10:56,356
If you sign
and honor your side of them...

155
00:10:57,128 --> 00:10:59,323
we are going to be successful.

156
00:10:59,463 --> 00:11:02,057
Damn, do I get a signing bonus
for signing this contract?

157
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:05,658
Yes, sir. You get to become a winner.

158
00:11:06,838 --> 00:11:09,898
Because if there's one thing I know,
it is this:

159
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:12,543
The losing stops now.

160
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:17,642
Starting today, you will play
like winners, act like winners...

161
00:11:17,748 --> 00:11:21,013
and, most importantly,
you will be winners.

162
00:11:21,752 --> 00:11:25,188
If you listen and learn,
you will win basketball games.

163
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,348
And, gentlemen, winning in here...

164
00:11:29,093 --> 00:11:31,391
is the key to winning out there.

165
00:11:31,996 --> 00:11:36,330
This contract states that you
will maintain a 2.3 grade point average.

166
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:38,567
You will attend all your classes...

167
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:41,570
and you will sit in the front row
of those classes.

168
00:11:41,672 --> 00:11:44,539
- This is a country-ass nigger.
- Excuse me.

169
00:11:44,642 --> 00:11:47,406
- Did you say something, sir?
- Worm was wondering...

170
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:51,072
are you some country church nigger,
with your tie on and all that?

171
00:11:51,182 --> 00:11:53,912
- That's what you wanted to say?
- And what is your name, sir?

172
00:11:54,018 --> 00:11:56,009
I'm Timo Cruz, sir.

173
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,987
Well, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Worm...

174
00:12:00,024 --> 00:12:04,256
what you should both know
is we treat ourselves with respect.

175
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:06,553
We don't use the word "nigger."

176
00:12:06,664 --> 00:12:08,757
Are you some preacher man
or some shit?

177
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:11,198
God ain't gonna do you no good
in this neighborhood.

178
00:12:11,302 --> 00:12:12,735
I live in this neighborhood, sir.

179
00:12:12,837 --> 00:12:15,738
Sir. Can you believe
this uppity Negro, sir?

180
00:12:18,242 --> 00:12:22,110
Okay, Mr. Cruz,
leave the gym right now.

181
00:12:22,213 --> 00:12:23,373
For what?

182
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:27,144
I'll ask you one last time
to leave the gym...

183
00:12:27,618 --> 00:12:29,415
before I help you leave.

184
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,454
- Before you what?
- Oh, man.

185
00:12:32,823 --> 00:12:34,586
Do you even know who I am?

186
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:37,718
From what I can see,
a very confused and scared young man.

187
00:12:37,828 --> 00:12:41,320
Scared of who? Scared of you?
I'm supposed to be scared of you?

188
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:44,668
Nigger, I ain't scared of nobody.
I will lay your ass out.

189
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:46,327
I don't think so.

190
00:12:52,143 --> 00:12:53,371
All right.

191
00:12:59,016 --> 00:13:01,041
What you doing? Get off me.

192
00:13:04,488 --> 00:13:06,581
Teachers ain't supposed
to touch students.

193
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:08,318
I'm not a teacher.

194
00:13:09,093 --> 00:13:11,254
I'm the new basketball coach.

195
00:13:20,004 --> 00:13:21,562
This ain't over!

196
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,421
Is there anybody else
who's not feeling this contract?

197
00:13:40,658 --> 00:13:42,853
Come on, man, where you going?

198
00:13:45,496 --> 00:13:47,430
I don't do high-school contracts.

199
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:49,362
You tell us when you need
the real ballers.

200
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:51,196
I will do that, sir.

201
00:13:51,469 --> 00:13:53,371
There goes our two leading scorers
from last season.

202
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:54,338
There goes our two leading scorers
from last season.

203
00:13:54,438 --> 00:13:57,771
Then I guess we'II have
new leading scorers this season, huh?

204
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,737
I cannot teach you
the game of basketball...

205
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:05,282
until your conditioning is at a level
that allows me to do so.

206
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,678
Gentlemen, report to the baseline.

207
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:13,581
To the baseline!

208
00:14:20,898 --> 00:14:24,595
I presume you all know
what suicides are. So...

209
00:14:33,077 --> 00:14:35,875
I saw the St. Francis game
the other night.

210
00:14:36,347 --> 00:14:39,111
None of you have a problem
shooting the ball.

211
00:14:39,216 --> 00:14:42,481
You all had a problem
getting up and down the court.

212
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:46,351
If you are late, you will run.

213
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:50,318
If you give me attitude,
you will do pushups.

214
00:14:51,228 --> 00:14:53,492
So you can pushup or shut up.

215
00:14:54,265 --> 00:14:55,994
That's up to you.

216
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,364
- How many are we gonna do?
- Sir.

217
00:14:59,503 --> 00:15:01,903
Yo, sir, how many are we gonna do?

218
00:15:02,173 --> 00:15:04,573
Let's see how many you can do in...

219
00:15:05,109 --> 00:15:07,577
one hour and seven minutes.

220
00:15:09,046 --> 00:15:11,173
Fellows, don't make me
commit homicide.

221
00:15:11,282 --> 00:15:14,740
I said, suicides.
Put your hand on the line.

222
00:15:20,024 --> 00:15:23,824
Man! I can't keep this shit up, man.
I can barely walk.

223
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:26,226
I know. My legs is hella sore,
know what I'm saying?

224
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,391
- Need some Gatorade or something.
- That was your girl right there, son.

225
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:34,437
Yeah. What's with you and her homies?
You gonna try to holler at them?

226
00:15:34,538 --> 00:15:37,735
- I'm hollering at both of the friends.
- Both of them?

227
00:15:37,842 --> 00:15:40,367
Yeah, 'cause I need that.
I need variety in my life.

228
00:15:40,478 --> 00:15:44,039
I can't just have one girl.
You know what I'm saying? I need both.

229
00:15:44,915 --> 00:15:46,405
- What's up, baby?
- How you doing?

230
00:15:46,517 --> 00:15:47,950
Ladies.

231
00:15:48,052 --> 00:15:50,520
Y'all heard about that
two-for-one special, right?

232
00:15:50,621 --> 00:15:53,590
Two of you, one of me.
Now, that's special.

233
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:57,484
- Please.
- Yeah, special ed.

234
00:15:57,595 --> 00:15:59,722
- Get your arm off me.
- I like this fox.

235
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,264
You working that chinchilla.
Look, baby, me and you...

236
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:04,732
You need to tell him
to stop playing it so close.

237
00:16:04,835 --> 00:16:06,769
She don't even like him.

238
00:16:07,404 --> 00:16:09,065
Why not? Worm's the man.

239
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:10,606
Worm is Worm.

240
00:16:13,544 --> 00:16:16,775
Anyway, I got something
for the baby today.

241
00:16:26,657 --> 00:16:28,352
We don't even know
if there's a baby yet.

242
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:31,587
I mean, it's kind of early.
You ain't even been to the doctor yet.

243
00:16:31,695 --> 00:16:34,493
Hello?
I passed the pregnancy test, Kenyon.

244
00:16:34,765 --> 00:16:36,164
Three times.

245
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,171
- These are kind of cute, though.
- I know. I got good taste, right?

246
00:16:46,277 --> 00:16:47,835
Yeah, all right.

247
00:16:48,712 --> 00:16:50,043
Precious little shoes.

248
00:16:50,147 --> 00:16:52,707
I got a little something for you, too.

249
00:16:58,722 --> 00:17:01,247
This definitely is a little something.

250
00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:06,422
- Where'd you get this?
- Don't sleep on the 99-Cent Store!

251
00:17:08,132 --> 00:17:09,622
- Kenyon!
- What's up?

252
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:11,758
What are you doing? Give me.

253
00:17:12,002 --> 00:17:13,731
Are you crazy?

254
00:17:13,837 --> 00:17:16,271
You got that for 99 cents?
You can get three brooms...

255
00:17:16,373 --> 00:17:18,671
and a bucket for 99 cents,
with some toilet paper.

256
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:21,939
That's like thread.
That's not even half a shoelace.

257
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,878
Would you like to see me
in this shoelace?

258
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:31,386
Quick feet. Let me see, quick feet.
Touch the floor.

259
00:17:31,488 --> 00:17:34,252
Stay big. Three pushups and move.

260
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:38,124
One, two, three. Let's go! Explode!

261
00:17:38,229 --> 00:17:39,992
Let me hear you!

262
00:17:41,565 --> 00:17:45,524
Explode! Worm, explode!
Touch the floor.

263
00:17:45,636 --> 00:17:47,968
Give me five. Five. Push.

264
00:17:48,672 --> 00:17:50,731
Go. Let me hear you.

265
00:17:51,308 --> 00:17:54,436
Come on, close out. John, explode.
Let's go.

266
00:17:56,847 --> 00:17:59,281
Sir, you're 20 minutes late.

267
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:05,151
That's 10 suicides for the whole team,
250 pushups for you.

268
00:18:05,689 --> 00:18:09,819
- This ain't the track team, man.
- Nor is it the debate team, Mr. Lyle.

269
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,952
But you're right.
And because you're right...

270
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,963
that's 20 suicides for the entire team.

271
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:18,466
And you get the privilege
of joining Mr. Battle...

272
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:20,298
with 250 pushups of your own.

273
00:18:20,404 --> 00:18:22,031
- What, are you serious?
- Yeah.

274
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:23,629
This is bullshit!

275
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:28,804
Good answer, Mr. Battle.
Johnny, tell him what he's won.

276
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:32,006
Because you gave such a good answer
and gave the coach attitude...

277
00:18:32,116 --> 00:18:35,449
you win the bonus prize of 500 pushups!

278
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:39,279
And would you like to go
for the grand prize of 1,000?

279
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,152
No, sir.

280
00:18:44,261 --> 00:18:47,697
To the baseline. On my whistle.
Let's go.

281
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:49,823
J.B. Come on, baby.

282
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:52,766
I can't even move, son.
Every muscle in my body hurts.

283
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,805
- You can't say nothing to him.
- Why can't I say nothing to him?

284
00:18:55,906 --> 00:18:57,567
I'm a white boy?

285
00:18:59,176 --> 00:19:02,145
Right here. Get this dude right here.

286
00:19:02,246 --> 00:19:04,077
Where you going, homey?

287
00:19:04,181 --> 00:19:06,513
- I ain't got shit.
- Please don't shoot me, man.

288
00:19:06,617 --> 00:19:09,586
- Go on, take my bag, dog.
- What's this shit, homey?

289
00:19:16,593 --> 00:19:20,723
That's some bullshit, Cruz!
I'm gonna visit you in County, dog.

290
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:23,860
I'm just playing. Look at you!

291
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:26,531
Damn!

292
00:19:27,137 --> 00:19:31,836
I saw y'all walking from up the block
like somebody put a pipe in your asses.

293
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:33,669
You all right, dog?

294
00:19:34,812 --> 00:19:39,306
Look, y'all weren't winning with me,
but you damn sure look sad without me.

295
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,646
But you know what?
I'm gonna watch y'all play.

296
00:19:41,752 --> 00:19:43,879
See y'all get your asses kicked.

297
00:19:44,655 --> 00:19:47,954
I'd love to shoot the shit
with you bitches all night, but I gotta go.

298
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:50,151
- All right.
- Who's that, man?

299
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:53,694
That's my cousin, Renny.
I'm gonna check y'all. Let's go.

300
00:19:53,797 --> 00:19:57,062
- Worm, you need a ride?
- No, I'm straight, man.

301
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:58,759
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm good.

302
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:00,302
- All right, my nigger.
- Good looking.

303
00:20:00,404 --> 00:20:01,962
All right, Lyle.

304
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:05,868
Don't let nobody else put a pipe
up your ass, or you might like it!

305
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,708
You were scared, huh?
I wasn't scared.

306
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,950
The state only requires
that they have a 2.0 average to play.

307
00:20:16,053 --> 00:20:17,850
You got it in here they need a 2.3.

308
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:21,220
If you have a 2.0, you have to score
at least 1,050 on the SAT...

309
00:20:21,325 --> 00:20:24,021
to be eligible for an athletic scholarship.

310
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:27,153
If you have a 2.3, you only need 950.

311
00:20:27,998 --> 00:20:30,193
Now, 2.3 is just a C-plus.

312
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:33,627
It shouldn't be that hard
to maintain a C-plus.

313
00:20:33,737 --> 00:20:38,299
These boys are student athletes.
"Student" comes first.

314
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:41,942
It says they gotta wear coat and ties
on game days.

315
00:20:42,045 --> 00:20:44,513
They don't own ties.
You gonna supply the ties?

316
00:20:44,615 --> 00:20:47,049
There's a Goodwill
and a Salvation Army store...

317
00:20:47,151 --> 00:20:49,142
less than two blocks from here.

318
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:52,086
And they got a box full of ties
for 50 cents apiece.

319
00:20:52,189 --> 00:20:54,020
What are you trying to say?

320
00:20:54,391 --> 00:20:57,588
We too good to shop at the Goodwill
and Salvation Army? Is that it?

321
00:20:57,694 --> 00:21:00,162
- Yeah, I ain't that broke.
- This is crazy.

322
00:21:00,264 --> 00:21:03,358
A dress code, and they have to sit
in the front row in class?

323
00:21:03,467 --> 00:21:07,699
- This is basketball, man!
- And basketball is a privilege, ma'am.

324
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:11,364
If you want to play basketball
on this team...

325
00:21:11,475 --> 00:21:14,342
these are the simple rules
you have to follow...

326
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:16,936
if you want to enjoy that privilege.

327
00:21:17,514 --> 00:21:20,711
Now, if you decide to follow
these simple rules...

328
00:21:21,018 --> 00:21:24,613
I need you and the boys
to sign this contract.

329
00:21:25,689 --> 00:21:28,852
They can bring the contracts
to practice tomorrow.

330
00:21:29,193 --> 00:21:31,127
If you come to practice.

331
00:21:31,328 --> 00:21:34,491
I wanna thank you all for coming out
and showing your support.

332
00:21:34,598 --> 00:21:37,726
And I hope I have your support
the rest of the season.

333
00:21:38,836 --> 00:21:40,633
- Good night.
- Get up and leave like that?

334
00:21:40,737 --> 00:21:43,399
Look, I have a hard enough time
getting my nephew to...

335
00:21:43,507 --> 00:21:46,271
How you gonna make them wear ties?

336
00:21:46,376 --> 00:21:48,344
I want the other coach back!

337
00:22:00,657 --> 00:22:04,354
It's one of your contracts, sir.
I've amended that contract.

338
00:22:05,162 --> 00:22:08,359
You require your players to maintain
a 2.3 grade point average.

339
00:22:08,465 --> 00:22:11,025
I've committed to maintaining a 3.5.

340
00:22:11,134 --> 00:22:13,034
You require 10 hours
of community service...

341
00:22:13,136 --> 00:22:14,535
and I've committed to 50.

342
00:22:14,638 --> 00:22:18,574
Any unexcused absences,
any other disciplinary issues at school...

343
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:23,136
you can nullify this agreement
and send me to any school you want.

344
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:26,606
And how many days do I have
to consider this offer?

345
00:22:26,717 --> 00:22:27,741
None.

346
00:22:27,951 --> 00:22:30,010
The second page is a letter
you need to sign...

347
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,850
that confirms my withdrawal
from St. Francis.

348
00:22:32,956 --> 00:22:34,856
- They know I'm leaving.
- What?

349
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,619
You withdrew from St. Francis?

350
00:22:36,727 --> 00:22:38,888
I called Richmond.
They expect me in the morning.

351
00:22:38,996 --> 00:22:40,691
You called Richmond?

352
00:22:40,864 --> 00:22:43,389
You should have spoken to me
about this.

353
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:45,899
It was a personal choice for me.

354
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,174
I can fix all that in the morning.

355
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:55,874
Sir, please, listen.
All I wanna do is play for you.

356
00:22:56,213 --> 00:22:58,147
If I'm one of the top students
at Richmond.

357
00:22:58,248 --> 00:23:00,273
I mean, one of the top
in the whole school...

358
00:23:00,384 --> 00:23:04,115
and I have great SATs,
I can go to any college in the country.

359
00:23:04,755 --> 00:23:06,814
I'm asking you to trust me.

360
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:11,427
You really wanna do this?

361
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:17,834
Okay.

362
00:23:19,002 --> 00:23:21,300
Part of growing up
is making your own decisions...

363
00:23:21,405 --> 00:23:23,771
and living with the consequences.

364
00:23:28,712 --> 00:23:30,771
Three-point-seven.

365
00:23:31,815 --> 00:23:35,148
And you will earn every minute
of playing time.

366
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:39,988
Open it, please.

367
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,581
- That's a nice tie.
- Morning, sir.

368
00:23:46,363 --> 00:23:49,628
My name is J. Lyle
They call me wild

369
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:52,364
It's all right

370
00:23:52,469 --> 00:23:53,800
Kenyon's mom tonight

371
00:23:53,904 --> 00:23:54,893
Say what?

372
00:23:55,005 --> 00:23:58,634
You might think I'm wrong
But she's got these thongs

373
00:24:00,143 --> 00:24:03,112
It's Malcolm X from St. Francis.
Malcolm.

374
00:24:03,213 --> 00:24:05,238
- Whatever.
- What's up, man?

375
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:07,112
What are you doing here, son?

376
00:24:07,217 --> 00:24:10,380
- I transferred to Richmond.
- No, son. I think you're just lost.

377
00:24:10,487 --> 00:24:12,955
I am actually lost.
Can you tell me how to get to...

378
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,455
Bel Air?

379
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:17,959
Worm, tell your man Fresh Prince here
how to get to his mansion.

380
00:24:18,061 --> 00:24:19,551
Fresh bitch.

381
00:24:22,966 --> 00:24:27,027
I hope seeing you in this hallway
means I'll see you on the court today.

382
00:24:28,538 --> 00:24:29,971
I can't wait.

383
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,405
With your five browns.

384
00:24:34,244 --> 00:24:35,711
Everybody up.

385
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:40,243
Today we're going to play defense.

386
00:24:41,718 --> 00:24:43,049
Sorry, sir.

387
00:24:43,987 --> 00:24:47,684
Gentlemen, this is a new player,
Damien Carter.

388
00:24:48,025 --> 00:24:52,758
He is my son and he is late.
Sir, you owe me 20 suicides.

389
00:24:53,163 --> 00:24:55,631
It's my first day of school.
I had to talk to my math...

390
00:24:55,732 --> 00:24:59,259
Basketball practice starts at 3:00.
As of 2:55, you are late.

391
00:24:59,703 --> 00:25:01,967
Get changed in the locker room.
Do your suicides...

392
00:25:02,072 --> 00:25:04,973
on the far side of the court
so as not to disturb us.

393
00:25:05,275 --> 00:25:07,607
All right, gentlemen, give me two lines.

394
00:25:08,578 --> 00:25:12,241
Okay, young sirs,
we're gonna take it to the next level.

395
00:25:13,016 --> 00:25:17,180
Everything I know about basketball,
I learned from women.

396
00:25:18,822 --> 00:25:21,586
I have a sister. Her name's Diane.

397
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:25,854
She was always on my case
about every little thing.

398
00:25:26,496 --> 00:25:28,521
Matter of fact, she still is.

399
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:30,790
"Turn down that radio!"

400
00:25:30,901 --> 00:25:34,962
"Did you eat the last piece of cake?
Did you drink all the Kool-Aid?"

401
00:25:35,706 --> 00:25:40,143
She was always in my face.
So when I call "Diane"...

402
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:44,210
we're gonna play straight man-to-man
pressure defense.

403
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:53,322
Worm! No, sir.
Look at your defensive posture.

404
00:25:53,423 --> 00:25:56,790
Come on. Split your man.
Back straight, butt down.

405
00:25:56,893 --> 00:25:58,724
This hand guards against
the passing lane.

406
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:01,525
This hand protects the crossover.
All right? Palms up!

407
00:26:01,631 --> 00:26:03,326
Get your head in the game.

408
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:05,664
Now we have Delilah.

409
00:26:06,636 --> 00:26:10,231
- She was my childhood sweetheart.
- Sir, was she hot?

410
00:26:10,807 --> 00:26:14,766
Yes, sir. She was steaming hot.

411
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,678
But she was the devil. That girl was evil.

412
00:26:21,551 --> 00:26:24,179
I remember once she tricked me
into stealing brownies...

413
00:26:24,287 --> 00:26:27,552
from Christ the King
First Baptist Church bake sale.

414
00:26:28,024 --> 00:26:30,720
She smiled and got her way out of it...

415
00:26:31,061 --> 00:26:34,053
while I damn near had to wear a pillow
on my butt for a month...

416
00:26:34,164 --> 00:26:35,688
before I could sit down.

417
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:39,166
Delilah, gentlemen.
She's our trap defense.

418
00:26:39,636 --> 00:26:43,367
Take notes, freshman. This is as close
as you're gonna get to playing.

419
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:49,478
Come on. Move. Delilah!

420
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,111
I know you're all concerned...

421
00:26:59,222 --> 00:27:01,747
that we didn't work on our offense
during practice.

422
00:27:01,858 --> 00:27:04,053
We have all season to do that.

423
00:27:04,161 --> 00:27:07,289
But what did we do in practice?
Mr. Stone?

424
00:27:08,265 --> 00:27:09,857
- Run.
- That's right.

425
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,133
So, what do you think
I want you to do on offense tonight?

426
00:27:13,236 --> 00:27:15,466
- Run?
- Correct again.

427
00:27:15,639 --> 00:27:17,539
I want you to run.

428
00:27:17,674 --> 00:27:21,508
I want you to run
every second that clock is ticking...

429
00:27:21,611 --> 00:27:23,442
all game long.

430
00:27:28,652 --> 00:27:30,643
Put him back on the bench.

431
00:27:32,455 --> 00:27:33,717
Rebound!

432
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,619
Let's go.

433
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,754
Nice pass, baby!

434
00:27:43,934 --> 00:27:45,333
Push it.

435
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,331
Screen, baby.

436
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,807
- Worm.
- Let's go, Worm.

437
00:27:58,181 --> 00:28:00,706
Stay alert! Pick him up right there.

438
00:28:00,817 --> 00:28:03,217
- Yeah!
- What's the call, ref?

439
00:28:03,353 --> 00:28:06,413
White four, fifth. He's out of the game.

440
00:28:06,523 --> 00:28:08,650
- Ref, come...
- That's his fifth foul, Coach.

441
00:28:08,758 --> 00:28:09,782
Time, sir.

442
00:28:09,893 --> 00:28:13,329
Bad call ref,
that was a jump ball, damn it!

443
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,790
Time-out, white.

444
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:18,334
Come on, fellows. Huddle up. Hustle up.
Get over here.

445
00:28:18,435 --> 00:28:21,404
All right. Huddle up.
Mr. Carter, you're in.

446
00:28:21,504 --> 00:28:24,473
- But, Coach, he's a freshman.
- You wanna coach?

447
00:28:25,308 --> 00:28:28,971
All right. Take a deep breath, guys.
Come on. Deep breaths.

448
00:28:29,646 --> 00:28:31,375
- You tired?
- No, sir.

449
00:28:31,748 --> 00:28:33,409
Those guys are exhausted.

450
00:28:33,516 --> 00:28:35,643
That's why this guy's
gonna miss that free throw.

451
00:28:35,752 --> 00:28:38,846
When he does, Worm and Lyle
are our first option.

452
00:28:38,955 --> 00:28:42,721
Push the ball. Go hard to the hole.
Everybody attack the boards. Got that?

453
00:28:42,826 --> 00:28:44,817
All right, Richmond on three.

454
00:28:45,161 --> 00:28:46,856
- One, two, three, Richmond!
- Richmond!

455
00:28:46,963 --> 00:28:49,727
- All right, let's out.
- Step it up, let's go!

456
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:51,425
Look alive out there.

457
00:28:53,103 --> 00:28:56,368
You're in better shape than they are.
Push it.

458
00:28:58,475 --> 00:28:59,806
Box out.

459
00:29:00,443 --> 00:29:01,535
One shot.

460
00:29:08,818 --> 00:29:10,979
- Right here. Kenyon.
- Come on.

461
00:29:11,087 --> 00:29:13,612
- Come on, baby. Come to the ball.
- Right here.

462
00:29:36,713 --> 00:29:39,477
Yeah, baby.
That's what I'm talking about.

463
00:29:45,956 --> 00:29:49,619
- Tight pass, baby.
- Nice pass, dog. It was all you.

464
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:53,488
A win like that means nothing.
They can't play anyway, you feel me?

465
00:29:56,499 --> 00:29:57,659
Okay, Shaq.

466
00:29:57,767 --> 00:30:00,827
So you dominated down low tonight.
Any thoughts?

467
00:30:01,538 --> 00:30:04,735
I dropped a 20-piece.
Kobe played his game.

468
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:07,366
We're the champions
till we ain't the champions no more.

469
00:30:07,477 --> 00:30:10,139
- Junior Battle.
- Undefeated until...

470
00:30:10,246 --> 00:30:14,080
On the real, that was the worst game
I've ever seen in my life.

471
00:30:14,184 --> 00:30:17,517
I thought that shit would never end.
I was dying up in the bleachers.

472
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,487
You were in the bleachers.
We were on court handling business.

473
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,649
That's right. We 1-0, bitch.

474
00:30:23,326 --> 00:30:26,921
On the real, Hercules is weak,
and y'all barely beat them.

475
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,931
Damn, Timo, why you throwing salt?
We undefeated.

476
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:33,525
- Show us love, son.
- Yeah, that's right, we undefeated.

477
00:30:34,004 --> 00:30:35,904
I'll knock all of y'all off.

478
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,902
I'll check y'all later, all right?

479
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,269
Let's do this.

480
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:23,244
- Here's two bundles, all right?
- All right.

481
00:31:23,353 --> 00:31:26,083
- Be careful. The block is hot.
- I got you.

482
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:30,389
- How you doing, man?
- Chilling, man.

483
00:31:30,493 --> 00:31:31,960
You look good.

484
00:31:32,595 --> 00:31:34,460
Got some paper for you.

485
00:31:35,565 --> 00:31:37,760
Now we're talking, yeah.

486
00:31:41,604 --> 00:31:43,401
How you living, Timo?

487
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:45,869
I'm good.

488
00:31:47,644 --> 00:31:49,635
- You all right? For real?
- Yeah.

489
00:31:51,548 --> 00:31:53,607
- Here, take some.
- I'm all right.

490
00:31:53,716 --> 00:31:55,650
No. Take some, please.

491
00:31:56,986 --> 00:31:59,420
You did good, man.
You're doing good, bro.

492
00:32:02,025 --> 00:32:03,185
Thank you.

493
00:32:03,293 --> 00:32:05,989
Don't thank me, thank you.
You earned it.

494
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:14,065
Take a nickel bag, okay?
Go get yourself something, man.

495
00:32:17,607 --> 00:32:19,575
- I'm gonna see you?
- Yeah, next week.

496
00:32:19,676 --> 00:32:22,645
Okay, I'm gonna see you. Keep it up.

497
00:32:22,745 --> 00:32:24,007
Yeah.

498
00:32:41,564 --> 00:32:43,500
Shaqua, Denise, holler at me.

499
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,797
Rafeca, I see you looking.

500
00:32:45,902 --> 00:32:48,462
Ain't nobody thinking about you, Worm.

501
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:50,663
- Okay.
- Gentlemen.

502
00:32:51,007 --> 00:32:53,237
Let's review the Hercules game,
shall we?

503
00:32:53,343 --> 00:32:55,402
Yell out my numbers, sir.

504
00:32:55,512 --> 00:32:58,538
Mr. Worm, you were five and four.

505
00:32:58,648 --> 00:33:00,946
No, sir. I had 12 points
and eight assists, sir.

506
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,074
No, sir, Mr. Worm.

507
00:33:02,185 --> 00:33:04,779
You had five turnovers
and four missed free throws.

508
00:33:07,357 --> 00:33:09,985
Now, we're talking about
fundamentals here.

509
00:33:10,093 --> 00:33:14,086
Until we learn them, I'm adding
a practice every morning at 6:00 a.m.

510
00:33:15,498 --> 00:33:17,693
We shot 56% at...

511
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,732
Mr. Cruz.

512
00:33:22,572 --> 00:33:25,632
- Are you lost, sir?
- What have I gotta do to play?

513
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:30,346
Mr. Cruz, you do not want to know
the answer to that question.

514
00:33:31,514 --> 00:33:34,642
Now, as I was saying, as a team...

515
00:33:34,751 --> 00:33:37,720
we shot 56% from the line.

516
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:41,351
From now on,
before you leave my gym...

517
00:33:41,658 --> 00:33:45,822
you must pay an exit price
of 50 made free throws...

518
00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:48,625
before you can go. That's everybody.

519
00:33:49,265 --> 00:33:51,563
- Come on.
- That's a lot of free throws.

520
00:33:54,204 --> 00:33:55,728
Okay, Mr. Cruz.

521
00:33:56,706 --> 00:34:00,733
Before you can play on this team,
you owe me...

522
00:34:04,147 --> 00:34:05,910
2,500 pushups...

523
00:34:06,482 --> 00:34:08,177
and 1,000 suicides.

524
00:34:08,384 --> 00:34:09,681
Damn.

525
00:34:13,423 --> 00:34:15,857
And they must be completed by Friday.

526
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:19,451
- He ain't finishing that by Friday.
- He ain't making that.

527
00:34:20,163 --> 00:34:23,098
Today's flavor: Offense.

528
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:26,996
- Now we talking.
- I have a sister. Her name is Linda.

529
00:34:28,304 --> 00:34:31,239
Linda is smart, she's political.

530
00:34:31,608 --> 00:34:33,803
Well, actually, she's radical.

531
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,340
Linda's got a big Afro.

532
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,308
Linda is our pick-and-roll offense.

533
00:34:41,317 --> 00:34:43,751
Before we get into that, let's warm up.

534
00:34:44,153 --> 00:34:46,747
Give me a lay-up line. Let's go.

535
00:34:47,156 --> 00:34:48,885
- All right.
- Let's do it.

536
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:52,553
- Damn, how many sisters has he got?
- Who knows?

537
00:34:52,662 --> 00:34:55,597
- Come on, get two more over here.
- Break it out.

538
00:34:55,865 --> 00:34:58,026
- Let's go, guys.
- Energy, guys.

539
00:34:58,134 --> 00:35:00,796
- We got this, let's go.
- I'm open.

540
00:35:00,903 --> 00:35:04,566
- I got him. Right here. I'm open.
- I'm sorry.

541
00:35:06,009 --> 00:35:08,842
- Come on.
- It's not my fault. He was early.

542
00:35:09,245 --> 00:35:11,679
Yes, it's important to move
without the ball.

543
00:35:11,781 --> 00:35:14,477
But you gotta be patient
on the weak-side screen.

544
00:35:14,584 --> 00:35:17,519
Set up your man
and come off his shoulder hard.

545
00:35:17,687 --> 00:35:19,450
- Okay?
- Okay.

546
00:35:19,922 --> 00:35:22,220
- Switch it up.
- We got it, come on.

547
00:35:23,192 --> 00:35:26,025
Let's go. And call out them picks.

548
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:30,995
What is your deepest fear, Mr. Cruz?

549
00:35:33,036 --> 00:35:34,936
That you're inadequate?

550
00:35:35,605 --> 00:35:37,266
Give up, Mr. Cruz.

551
00:35:38,741 --> 00:35:39,969
Go home.

552
00:35:45,148 --> 00:35:48,606
All right, I want seven passes
before you shoot. Seven.

553
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:51,981
All right. I got him.

554
00:35:52,121 --> 00:35:53,986
Get that ball in there.

555
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,357
You know your task is impossible
before Friday, right?

556
00:36:04,133 --> 00:36:06,795
Move. Work it.

557
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:10,804
Run it back.

558
00:36:34,397 --> 00:36:38,629
- What time your mom getting home?
- She doesn't get off for another hour.

559
00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:48,176
That's Myles.

560
00:36:48,878 --> 00:36:50,004
What?

561
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:04,221
Come on.

562
00:37:04,761 --> 00:37:06,729
Say, "Hi, Uncle Kenyon."

563
00:37:07,997 --> 00:37:11,330
Say, "Hi." All right, don't worry about it.

564
00:37:11,567 --> 00:37:15,230
He'II go back to sleep
right after his bottle. Right, boo-boo?

565
00:37:15,338 --> 00:37:18,000
Yeah, probably in time
for your mom to get home.

566
00:37:18,107 --> 00:37:21,201
Or when your cousin gets back
from getting her hair fried and dyed.

567
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,835
Like she can afford all that shit.
It's her baby anyway.

568
00:37:23,946 --> 00:37:28,883
My mother had to work a double shift,
but they cut her overtime.

569
00:37:29,185 --> 00:37:31,653
And my cousin, don't be trying
to diss her.

570
00:37:31,754 --> 00:37:33,847
You said we'd be alone.
You call this alone?

571
00:37:33,956 --> 00:37:36,083
That's why we need our own spot.

572
00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:42,521
- Did you turn this off?
- Yeah, it was boiling.

573
00:37:42,632 --> 00:37:46,762
Come on. Turn it down, not off.

574
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:50,871
This is milk, butter, and cheese.
We can't afford to waste this.

575
00:37:50,973 --> 00:37:52,964
And hold him up.

576
00:37:59,048 --> 00:38:02,848
Making the baby's bottle for Myles.

577
00:38:02,952 --> 00:38:06,820
All right, Myles, here we go.
Gotta cool off a minute.

578
00:38:13,596 --> 00:38:17,032
Ever think about what you were going
to do before you were pregnant?

579
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:18,930
What do you mean,
going to junior college?

580
00:38:19,035 --> 00:38:22,198
- Yeah.
- I thought about it.

581
00:38:22,939 --> 00:38:25,533
I could go later, I guess.

582
00:38:26,342 --> 00:38:29,140
You have to get some work
after you have the baby.

583
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:30,673
Me, too.

584
00:38:31,547 --> 00:38:34,243
- So I'll work.
- How you gonna go to school?

585
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,147
Why you asking me all these questions?

586
00:38:36,252 --> 00:38:38,880
And you gotta put your hands
under his arm.

587
00:38:38,988 --> 00:38:41,582
You gotta sit him on your chest.
Hold him.

588
00:38:42,925 --> 00:38:44,392
I am holding him.

589
00:38:44,494 --> 00:38:47,930
You ain't doing it right.
You gotta soothe him, Kenyon.

590
00:38:50,733 --> 00:38:52,826
I don't know how to do this.

591
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:55,236
You'II get it.

592
00:38:56,272 --> 00:38:57,296
Right?

593
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:04,174
Look, I gotta help my mom
with some stuff.

594
00:39:05,948 --> 00:39:08,712
- See you later, all right?
- All right.

595
00:39:11,153 --> 00:39:13,713
- Call me later, okay?
- Later.

596
00:39:18,394 --> 00:39:21,795
All right, keep riding on somebody.
Don't get lost in there.

597
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,961
Stay with your man.

598
00:39:26,068 --> 00:39:28,366
- Box out.
- Position.

599
00:39:35,177 --> 00:39:38,010
You don't get to your man.
Stay and watch the ball.

600
00:39:38,114 --> 00:39:40,742
When the ball goes up,
get in good defensive position...

601
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,683
get your body on your man
and explode to the ball.

602
00:39:43,786 --> 00:39:45,481
All right? Let's go.

603
00:39:46,355 --> 00:39:48,050
Run it. You got it.

604
00:39:48,491 --> 00:39:49,753
Throw your pass.

605
00:39:50,526 --> 00:39:52,221
- Work it.
- There you go.

606
00:39:52,328 --> 00:39:55,559
Mrs. Fenton, the police are telling
a very different story.

607
00:39:55,932 --> 00:39:58,594
I wish you would.
Yes, ma'am, I'm here all week.

608
00:39:58,701 --> 00:40:02,193
- Mr. Carter, how are the boys?
- They're great, ma'am.

609
00:40:02,305 --> 00:40:04,296
- We're 1-0.
- Very good.

610
00:40:04,974 --> 00:40:06,965
How may I help you?

611
00:40:08,511 --> 00:40:10,342
I had my boys sign contracts...

612
00:40:10,446 --> 00:40:13,574
requiring them to meet
certain academic standards.

613
00:40:13,716 --> 00:40:16,276
Yes, I believe one of
the faculty members mentioned that.

614
00:40:16,385 --> 00:40:18,580
Very interesting scare tactic.

615
00:40:19,822 --> 00:40:22,313
In order for that to be successful...

616
00:40:22,425 --> 00:40:25,258
I need their teachers
to fill out weekly progress reports...

617
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:28,558
so I'll know how the boys are doing
in their classrooms.

618
00:40:28,764 --> 00:40:29,924
Okay.

619
00:40:30,032 --> 00:40:32,899
I haven't received anything
from their teachers.

620
00:40:35,705 --> 00:40:39,698
I don't see how this ties in to your job
as the basketball coach, Mr. Carter.

621
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:43,506
I took this job with the understanding
I could do it my way.

622
00:40:43,846 --> 00:40:47,407
And you can. Our next faculty meeting
is in two weeks.

623
00:40:47,516 --> 00:40:48,881
I'll remember to bring it up.

624
00:40:48,985 --> 00:40:51,783
That would be great. Thank you, ma'am.

625
00:40:53,956 --> 00:40:55,446
Thank you, sir.

626
00:40:58,294 --> 00:40:59,625
Bring it in, guys.

627
00:41:01,063 --> 00:41:05,432
- Let's go, hustle up.
- Bring it in, y'all. Hustle up.

628
00:41:05,868 --> 00:41:07,597
All right, that's it for today.

629
00:41:07,703 --> 00:41:10,763
We have a game tomorrow,
so get some rest tonight.

630
00:41:10,873 --> 00:41:14,570
And remember,
ties and jackets tomorrow.

631
00:41:16,212 --> 00:41:17,372
Clyde.

632
00:41:25,588 --> 00:41:26,816
Mr. Cruz.

633
00:41:29,558 --> 00:41:33,995
I'm impressed with what you've done.
But you came up short.

634
00:41:35,131 --> 00:41:37,793
You owe me 80 suicides
and 500 pushups.

635
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:41,498
Please leave my gym.

636
00:41:44,006 --> 00:41:47,237
Thanks, Clyde.
Gentlemen, see you tomorrow.

637
00:41:51,447 --> 00:41:53,438
I'll do pushups for him.

638
00:41:58,654 --> 00:42:00,519
You said we're a team.

639
00:42:01,357 --> 00:42:03,985
One person struggles, we all struggle.

640
00:42:04,627 --> 00:42:07,152
One player triumphs,
we all triumph, right?

641
00:42:23,913 --> 00:42:25,346
I'll do some.

642
00:42:26,082 --> 00:42:27,913
I'll run suicides, too.

643
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,247
I'll do some, too.

644
00:43:13,429 --> 00:43:15,363
Clyde, let's keep count.

645
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,925
Call me when they're done.

646
00:43:24,306 --> 00:43:26,331
Defense.

647
00:43:26,442 --> 00:43:29,878
Push it. Move. Let's go.

648
00:43:30,513 --> 00:43:32,242
Ball.

649
00:43:41,457 --> 00:43:44,517
Move your feet. Go, defense. Go.

650
00:43:46,295 --> 00:43:47,694
Good job. Worm.

651
00:43:47,797 --> 00:43:50,493
- White ball.
- Palms up, move your feet, right?

652
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:52,965
Come out.

653
00:43:53,068 --> 00:43:55,002
- Mr. Cruz!
- Good game, boy.

654
00:44:00,009 --> 00:44:02,477
What is your deepest fear, young man?

655
00:44:04,914 --> 00:44:06,245
Go in.

656
00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:09,784
Why does he keep saying that?
What does that mean?

657
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,882
Let's go. Move.

658
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:17,552
No, one more pass.

659
00:44:23,432 --> 00:44:24,399
Push it.

660
00:44:26,135 --> 00:44:27,159
Hands up.

661
00:44:27,269 --> 00:44:29,169
Let's go. Don't relax.

662
00:44:40,549 --> 00:44:42,244
Get back!

663
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,450
What the hell are you doing, Cruz?
You allergic to lay-ups?

664
00:45:20,556 --> 00:45:23,548
You do that again,
you're gonna be glued to the bench.

665
00:45:26,962 --> 00:45:28,122
Swing it.

666
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,289
- Right here.
- Run them up.

667
00:45:33,936 --> 00:45:37,064
Come on, last kick. Kick it in.

668
00:45:37,172 --> 00:45:40,073
- Let's go.
- Good work today.

669
00:45:46,982 --> 00:45:49,883
You can't guard me, can you?
What you gonna do?

670
00:45:49,985 --> 00:45:52,647
- Can't do nothing about it, can you?
- Delilah!

671
00:45:54,323 --> 00:45:55,950
- Jump!
- Yeah, Jason.

672
00:46:00,696 --> 00:46:03,290
Kenyon, pose for me. Smile.

673
00:46:03,432 --> 00:46:06,629
Kenyon, Maddux! Get back.
Just play the damn game.

674
00:46:08,337 --> 00:46:09,634
Linda.

675
00:46:12,675 --> 00:46:13,801
There he is.

676
00:46:15,044 --> 00:46:19,606
That's me, baby.
I did that! I drew that up!

677
00:46:22,217 --> 00:46:24,014
Run it again.

678
00:46:24,586 --> 00:46:27,077
All right, one-four. Linda.

679
00:46:32,461 --> 00:46:37,091
All day, baby. Can't stop that.

680
00:46:38,801 --> 00:46:42,202
- Coach, your shoe's untied, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Worm.

681
00:46:45,874 --> 00:46:49,332
Look at that bow. I tied that!

682
00:46:49,445 --> 00:46:51,072
I tied that shit!

683
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,842
Can I get something on the bow?
Let me get some.

684
00:46:54,016 --> 00:46:55,483
Are you crazy?

685
00:46:56,185 --> 00:46:58,085
What is wrong with you?

686
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,615
What's wrong with all of you?

687
00:47:01,223 --> 00:47:03,851
Since when is winning not enough?

688
00:47:04,693 --> 00:47:07,389
Playing hard not enough?

689
00:47:08,464 --> 00:47:11,456
No. You have to humiliate
your opponent.

690
00:47:12,134 --> 00:47:14,261
Taunt him after every score.

691
00:47:15,137 --> 00:47:17,401
You won four games last season.

692
00:47:18,007 --> 00:47:18,974
Four!

693
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:23,104
What gives you the right
to taint the game that I love...

694
00:47:23,212 --> 00:47:25,373
with trash talk and taunting?

695
00:47:25,781 --> 00:47:29,239
What gives you the right
to wear Richmond on your chests...

696
00:47:29,351 --> 00:47:31,717
- and act like punks?
- Coach, they were jawing, too.

697
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,789
So? You can't show some class?

698
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:36,821
Act like a champion?

699
00:47:40,496 --> 00:47:42,760
You owe me 500 pushups apiece.

700
00:47:43,699 --> 00:47:45,997
On the line. Now!

701
00:47:46,702 --> 00:47:48,567
Oh, man, come on.

702
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:08,383
Listen, shorty.
I'm just gonna be real with you, okay?

703
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,021
You're my girl.

704
00:48:10,692 --> 00:48:14,526
I get out on that court,
and everything is just getting crazy...

705
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:17,030
all I gotta do is just think about you.

706
00:48:17,132 --> 00:48:18,360
Mr. Lyle.

707
00:48:19,034 --> 00:48:20,763
Why aren't you in...

708
00:48:22,671 --> 00:48:25,139
- geometry?
- I'm going there right now, sir.

709
00:48:26,842 --> 00:48:28,833
- Sir, this is Betty.
- Bella.

710
00:48:28,944 --> 00:48:31,208
- This is Bella, sir.
- Go to class.

711
00:48:37,352 --> 00:48:40,947
Don't forget that these projects
are due at the end of this week.

712
00:48:41,056 --> 00:48:43,354
- So if any of you need extra time...
- Excuse me, sir.

713
00:48:43,459 --> 00:48:45,256
- Are you Mr. Gesek?
- Yes.

714
00:48:47,229 --> 00:48:49,891
I don't see Junior Battle in this class.

715
00:48:49,998 --> 00:48:52,967
Junior Battle is like a solar eclipse.

716
00:48:53,068 --> 00:48:56,504
We rarely see him.
But when we do, it's always special.

717
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:00,472
Thank you.

718
00:49:02,244 --> 00:49:05,338
"Surprise arrival to the poll
is Richmond High at 19th."

719
00:49:05,447 --> 00:49:07,108
Top 20, baby.

720
00:49:07,216 --> 00:49:10,652
We're 19th, dog.
"The Oilers posted a perfect 9-0 mark.

721
00:49:10,752 --> 00:49:13,118
"Winning on the road
against perennial powerhouses...

722
00:49:13,222 --> 00:49:15,190
"Xavier and Baxter Union."

723
00:49:18,727 --> 00:49:22,891
You should read the rest of this.
They're blowing you up in this paper.

724
00:49:23,165 --> 00:49:25,963
- Come on, man, read it.
- Man, you know he can't read.

725
00:49:26,068 --> 00:49:28,229
Shut up, Maddux.

726
00:49:30,339 --> 00:49:33,866
"Richmond's center has been big
as the Oilers are...

727
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:35,477
"boyed"?

728
00:49:35,577 --> 00:49:38,478
"Buoyed." The word is "buoyed."

729
00:49:40,516 --> 00:49:44,919
"Buoyed by Junior Battle's
19.8- Rebound-a-night numbers."

730
00:49:45,821 --> 00:49:48,722
See, that's my big nigger
right there, son.

731
00:49:48,824 --> 00:49:52,225
If you were any bigger,
you'd be my bigger nigger.

732
00:49:53,695 --> 00:49:55,526
Sit down!

733
00:50:03,972 --> 00:50:05,234
Nigger...

734
00:50:05,807 --> 00:50:10,540
is a derogatory term
used to insult our ancestors.

735
00:50:11,747 --> 00:50:14,944
See, if a white man used it,
you'd be ready to fight.

736
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:17,848
Your using it teaches him to use it.

737
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:21,114
You're saying it's cool.
Well, it's not cool.

738
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:24,691
And when you're around me,
I don't wanna hear that shit. We clear?

739
00:50:24,793 --> 00:50:26,385
Yes, sir.

740
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,364
Mr. Worm, what is it you want
out of this basketball season?

741
00:50:36,104 --> 00:50:38,538
To win that state championship, sir.

742
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:44,140
Who won the state basketball
championship last season, Lyle?

743
00:50:45,047 --> 00:50:46,776
Hell if I know, sir.

744
00:50:47,816 --> 00:50:49,443
Does anybody know?

745
00:50:52,421 --> 00:50:53,479
Okay.

746
00:50:54,323 --> 00:50:57,224
What's your father do for a living,
Mr. Lyle?

747
00:51:00,896 --> 00:51:02,864
My father's in jail, sir.

748
00:51:06,802 --> 00:51:08,895
I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

749
00:51:09,204 --> 00:51:11,798
But that doesn't have to be your life.

750
00:51:12,975 --> 00:51:16,502
My point is this:
I have four seniors on this team.

751
00:51:17,246 --> 00:51:19,908
Junior, Lyle, Kenyon, and Worm.

752
00:51:20,415 --> 00:51:23,976
All of whom, I think, can play basketball
at the college level.

753
00:51:24,353 --> 00:51:25,547
College.

754
00:51:26,622 --> 00:51:29,216
That's a viable option for all of you.

755
00:51:30,058 --> 00:51:33,824
But you have to perform
in the classroom to have that chance.

756
00:51:34,496 --> 00:51:36,487
You have to have a vision.

757
00:51:37,866 --> 00:51:41,324
Tell me, how do you see yourselves?

758
00:51:43,905 --> 00:51:45,770
ESPN, baby.

759
00:51:46,908 --> 00:51:49,001
That reminds me, Mr. Battle.

760
00:51:49,578 --> 00:51:53,776
Mr. Gesek tells me he doesn't see you
in his classroom very often.

761
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:56,983
Yeah, we cool, though, me and him.

762
00:51:57,386 --> 00:51:59,479
Mr. Gesek is a big basketball fan.

763
00:52:01,023 --> 00:52:03,014
As of now, you're suspended.

764
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:05,116
Oh, you can practice,
but you can't play...

765
00:52:05,227 --> 00:52:08,663
until Mr. Gesek tells me
you're caught up in his class.

766
00:52:08,964 --> 00:52:11,558
And that's a shout-out to the rest of you.

767
00:52:11,667 --> 00:52:14,397
You signed a contract.
You made a commitment.

768
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:18,501
I have your schedules and I'll be getting
reports from your teachers.

769
00:52:18,907 --> 00:52:22,843
If you don't perform in the classroom,
you will not play.

770
00:52:23,478 --> 00:52:25,241
What's up with that?

771
00:52:25,781 --> 00:52:27,544
Sit down, Mr. Battle.

772
00:52:30,085 --> 00:52:32,815
All right, that's 500 pushups.

773
00:52:34,589 --> 00:52:37,990
This is bullshit!
We won those games, not you.

774
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,724
That's 1,000 pushups
for Mr. Battle, Clyde.

775
00:52:41,963 --> 00:52:43,931
You wanna try for 2,000?

776
00:53:00,549 --> 00:53:01,880
Young man...

777
00:53:02,084 --> 00:53:05,986
think about the choice you're making
if you walk out that door.

778
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:16,688
To the baseline.

779
00:53:20,135 --> 00:53:24,538
All right. How about LaQuisha
if it's a girl.

780
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:26,971
LaQuisha? Okay, yeah.

781
00:53:27,075 --> 00:53:29,373
The ghetto called,
and they want their name back.

782
00:53:29,478 --> 00:53:31,378
Girl, LaQuisha? Be for real.

783
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,313
You might as well call the baby
Food Stamp.

784
00:53:34,416 --> 00:53:38,079
You're stupid. All right, I was thinking...

785
00:53:38,487 --> 00:53:41,786
- I could call her Harmony.
- I like Harmony.

786
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:45,189
- Harmony, that's cute. I like that.
- What did Kenyon say?

787
00:53:45,727 --> 00:53:48,025
- Please, he wants a boy.
- Figures.

788
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:51,190
- Speaking of Michael Jordan.
- What's wrong with a girl?

789
00:53:51,566 --> 00:53:55,024
Yeah, dog, boys grow into men,
and men ain't worth the trouble.

790
00:53:55,137 --> 00:53:58,004
Don't you have someplace to go?
Something to do?

791
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:02,642
Guess he wants me all to himself.
See you later.

792
00:54:02,778 --> 00:54:04,803
Don't forget,
I need your notes for history.

793
00:54:04,913 --> 00:54:07,677
- All right, I got you.
- Yeah. See you later.

794
00:54:10,118 --> 00:54:12,382
I bought us tickets to the dance.

795
00:54:12,954 --> 00:54:15,548
Why you telling these loudmouth girls
about the baby?

796
00:54:15,657 --> 00:54:17,625
Now everybody's gonna know.

797
00:54:17,726 --> 00:54:19,785
People are gonna know, Kenyon.

798
00:54:19,895 --> 00:54:21,487
It's not people's business, Kyra.

799
00:54:21,596 --> 00:54:24,759
Why you jumping down my throat?
What's wrong with you?

800
00:54:25,367 --> 00:54:29,701
Look, me and Coach been talking,
and he thinks I can play college ball.

801
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:31,328
All right, so?

802
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:34,538
So how am I gonna do that
and raise a baby?

803
00:54:37,012 --> 00:54:38,445
I don't know.

804
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,071
I'm not saying that it won't be hard.

805
00:54:41,183 --> 00:54:44,277
Hard? It's already hard.
The kid ain't even here yet...

806
00:54:44,386 --> 00:54:48,015
and I'm worried about how
I'm gonna feed it, pay for this and that.

807
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,021
Everything.

808
00:54:50,192 --> 00:54:51,420
I'm not ready.

809
00:54:51,526 --> 00:54:53,756
So, what are you saying? You want out?

810
00:54:53,862 --> 00:54:56,990
Is that what you're saying?
Go ahead and say it.

811
00:54:57,265 --> 00:55:00,428
Look, if I wanted to be out,
I would've been out by now, Kyra.

812
00:55:00,535 --> 00:55:03,527
That's not it at all. I love you.
I wanna be with you.

813
00:55:03,905 --> 00:55:05,770
Yeah, as long as it's convenient.

814
00:55:05,874 --> 00:55:07,569
I'm thinking about what's best for us.

815
00:55:07,676 --> 00:55:10,474
You're not trying to
think about what's best for both of us...

816
00:55:10,579 --> 00:55:12,410
you're thinking about
what's best for you.

817
00:55:12,514 --> 00:55:15,711
You don't want me to have this baby.
You wanna leave Richmond?

818
00:55:15,817 --> 00:55:18,718
You wanna go play college ball?
So guess what?

819
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:22,256
We ain't got to be ready enough
for nothing, all right?

820
00:55:23,291 --> 00:55:26,021
I'm ready enough to do what I gotta do
all by my damn self.

821
00:55:26,127 --> 00:55:29,290
So you can take these
and go to the dance yourself.

822
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:31,900
Progress reports?
You're the basketball coach.

823
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,561
Progress reports?
You're the basketball coach.

824
00:55:33,668 --> 00:55:36,136
Ma'am, we talked about this.
I don't see the problem.

825
00:55:36,238 --> 00:55:37,933
Do you know what the API is,
Mr. Carter?

826
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:39,597
No, I don't.

827
00:55:39,708 --> 00:55:41,676
The Academic Performance Index.

828
00:55:41,776 --> 00:55:44,643
They judge schools on a scale
of one to 10, 10 being the best.

829
00:55:44,746 --> 00:55:47,271
Do you have any idea
where Richmond falls on that scale?

830
00:55:47,382 --> 00:55:48,713
No, ma'am, I have no idea.

831
00:55:48,817 --> 00:55:51,752
We're a one, Mr. Carter,
and have been for the last seven years.

832
00:55:51,853 --> 00:55:53,912
The state rewards schools
for their performance.

833
00:55:54,022 --> 00:55:57,048
So every year I have less money
to pay faculty and staff.

834
00:55:57,158 --> 00:55:59,388
Can I ask what it is you want,
Mr. Carter?

835
00:55:59,494 --> 00:56:01,724
- I want my boys to go to college.
- College?

836
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:04,628
Mr. Carter, Richmond graduates
50% of its students...

837
00:56:04,733 --> 00:56:07,793
the higher percentage being girls.
In my very educated opinion...

838
00:56:07,903 --> 00:56:10,997
you have 15 players on your team,
you'II be lucky to graduate five.

839
00:56:11,106 --> 00:56:13,131
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but I don't agree with you.

840
00:56:13,241 --> 00:56:16,039
These boys signed contracts.
Maybe if you'd read one of them...

841
00:56:16,144 --> 00:56:18,806
Your job is to win basketball games,
Mr. Carter.

842
00:56:18,914 --> 00:56:20,905
I suggest you start doing your job.

843
00:56:21,016 --> 00:56:23,416
And your job is to educate these kids.

844
00:56:23,518 --> 00:56:26,248
I suggest you start doing yours.

845
00:56:42,504 --> 00:56:44,495
We had another good week.

846
00:56:44,806 --> 00:56:47,297
Yeah, business is very good, Kenny.

847
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:52,041
But I'm on my own. You're never here.
It gets crazy.

848
00:56:52,213 --> 00:56:54,204
Look, I appreciate everything you do.

849
00:56:54,316 --> 00:56:56,511
And I promise you... We're closed.

850
00:56:56,651 --> 00:56:59,176
As soon as the season is over,
I will be here for you.

851
00:56:59,287 --> 00:57:01,619
Mr. Carter? I'm...

852
00:57:01,723 --> 00:57:04,292
Junior Battle's mother.
Yes, ma'am, I remember you.

853
00:57:04,593 --> 00:57:06,959
Willa Battle.

854
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:11,360
- How may I help you, ma'am?
- I got a phone call today...

855
00:57:11,466 --> 00:57:14,401
from a coach at a junior college
in Sacramento.

856
00:57:14,502 --> 00:57:16,527
They wanna see Junior play this Friday.

857
00:57:16,638 --> 00:57:19,129
Well, that's great, ma'am,
but Junior broke some rules...

858
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,937
And I agree with them.
I'm not here to argue with your rules.

859
00:57:23,745 --> 00:57:24,973
I'm not.

860
00:57:28,183 --> 00:57:29,912
Almost two years ago now...

861
00:57:31,052 --> 00:57:33,987
Junior's older brother, Anton...

862
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:40,523
was killed, and it's been confusing
and hard for me, and for Junior.

863
00:57:42,197 --> 00:57:44,062
After you lose a son...

864
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,830
every time the phone rings...

865
00:57:48,703 --> 00:57:50,295
your heart stops.

866
00:57:52,607 --> 00:57:54,871
I'm not asking for special attention.

867
00:57:55,377 --> 00:57:58,312
I agree he needs to get straight
with his classes.

868
00:57:59,481 --> 00:58:03,315
But the idea of junior college
had never even occurred to my son.

869
00:58:03,418 --> 00:58:07,286
I could move to the Hercules district
and he could play there.

870
00:58:07,389 --> 00:58:11,587
- Moving is not gonna solve...
- But I want him to play for you.

871
00:58:14,229 --> 00:58:17,426
I'm not gonna stand here and say
I know how it feels to lose a son...

872
00:58:17,532 --> 00:58:19,090
because I don't.

873
00:58:19,834 --> 00:58:23,326
And I do appreciate
you putting your trust in me.

874
00:58:25,073 --> 00:58:27,268
But I need to hear that from Junior.

875
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:28,933
He's in the car.

876
00:58:34,282 --> 00:58:35,476
Junior!

877
00:58:46,528 --> 00:58:47,654
Go on.

878
00:58:53,568 --> 00:58:55,900
I'm sorry for what I said
and did at practice.

879
00:58:56,004 --> 00:58:58,871
And I promise to get caught up
with my classes, sir.

880
00:59:04,212 --> 00:59:06,146
Look me in the eye, sir.

881
00:59:11,386 --> 00:59:14,355
Everything inside me tells me
if I take you back...

882
00:59:14,456 --> 00:59:16,981
I'd be making a mistake,
and you'II make a fool of me.

883
00:59:17,092 --> 00:59:18,320
No, sir.

884
00:59:21,696 --> 00:59:26,065
You owe me 1,000 pushups
and 1,000 suicides before you can play.

885
00:59:26,768 --> 00:59:29,168
I'll see you at practice tomorrow.

886
00:59:31,439 --> 00:59:32,929
Thank you, sir.

887
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,350
And you gonna do
every last one of them.

888
00:59:44,452 --> 00:59:48,081
Quitting basketball like you pay rent.
I don't know who you think you are.

889
00:59:48,189 --> 00:59:51,626
The next time you plan to make
a decision, you better ask me first.

890
00:59:51,893 --> 00:59:54,259
Junior, you did your thing tonight, man.

891
00:59:54,362 --> 00:59:56,592
- Good-Iooking out.
- Yeah, good shot, Junior.

892
00:59:56,698 --> 00:59:59,189
- Yeah, no doubt.
- Gentlemen, listen up.

893
00:59:59,834 --> 01:00:04,362
I just received a call from the director
of the Bayhill Holiday Tournament.

894
01:00:04,773 --> 01:00:07,003
You have been invited.

895
01:00:07,142 --> 01:00:08,973
Yeah!

896
01:00:12,113 --> 01:00:15,344
Hold. Now, I have more good news.

897
01:00:15,784 --> 01:00:20,278
I spoke to Principal Garrison today.
She informs me that all your teachers...

898
01:00:20,388 --> 01:00:24,222
will have academic progress reports
prepared by the end of holiday break.

899
01:00:24,325 --> 01:00:26,156
Sir, our grades are tight.

900
01:00:26,261 --> 01:00:29,662
Not only are our grades all right,
but we're undefeated, homeboy.

901
01:00:29,764 --> 01:00:30,992
Yeah!

902
01:00:32,267 --> 01:00:35,134
We undefeated

903
01:00:45,113 --> 01:00:49,015
Big ups to everybody who came out
to the Richmond High winter dance.

904
01:00:49,117 --> 01:00:50,584
Get down.

905
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:16,302
So give it up
for the new kings of Richmond, y'all!

906
01:01:16,411 --> 01:01:18,242
Yeah! Give it up, baby.

907
01:01:18,346 --> 01:01:20,211
We 12-0, y'all, and I just wanna say...

908
01:01:20,315 --> 01:01:23,341
I wanna see all the beautiful people
up at that tournament.

909
01:01:23,451 --> 01:01:26,682
You know! Y'all gonna wanna see
the look on the faces...

910
01:01:26,788 --> 01:01:30,383
of them rich fancy-schoolers when
the Richmond Oilers roll into town.

911
01:01:30,491 --> 01:01:31,856
Holler!

912
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:55,703
Kyra, what are you thinking?
You can't drink. You're pregnant, girl.

913
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:57,141
Stop.

914
01:02:57,245 --> 01:03:00,271
It's soda, all right?
Why don't you just go back downstairs...

915
01:03:00,381 --> 01:03:02,815
and find one of your little girlies
to freak with.

916
01:03:02,917 --> 01:03:05,442
It ain't even like that.
Some girl just danced up on me.

917
01:03:05,553 --> 01:03:07,748
- Whatever.
- You shouldn't even be here.

918
01:03:07,855 --> 01:03:10,688
If you're having this baby,
you need to check all this bullshit.

919
01:03:10,792 --> 01:03:13,056
- Because if not...
- If not, what, Kenyon?

920
01:03:13,161 --> 01:03:15,356
You wanna hold my hand
through an abortion?

921
01:03:15,463 --> 01:03:18,432
I don't know what I want. You're so sure
you wanna have this baby...

922
01:03:18,533 --> 01:03:20,694
you tell me how it's gonna be,
how we'II make it.

923
01:03:20,802 --> 01:03:23,032
Everything's great, right?
Your cousin is 19...

924
01:03:23,137 --> 01:03:25,799
with two kids already, Kyra. It's great?

925
01:03:26,441 --> 01:03:30,138
It was great when we was getting down.
You had no second thoughts about that.

926
01:03:30,244 --> 01:03:32,678
You loved me when it came to that.

927
01:03:35,249 --> 01:03:37,979
Kyra, I can't tell you what to do,
but I look around...

928
01:03:38,086 --> 01:03:40,213
and I see exactly how I don't wanna live.

929
01:03:40,321 --> 01:03:42,721
Paycheck to paycheck? Dead-end job?

930
01:03:43,424 --> 01:03:45,949
You make it seem
like everything's gonna be all good...

931
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,028
like everything's so wonderful.

932
01:03:49,263 --> 01:03:50,924
You don't care about me.

933
01:03:52,166 --> 01:03:56,068
You just wanna go to college,
play ball, and forget about me.

934
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:58,730
- Kyra, that's not how it is.
- I don't care what you say.

935
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,365
- I'm having this baby.
- And then what?

936
01:04:01,909 --> 01:04:03,411
You got everything figured out, right?
So tell me what comes next.

937
01:04:03,411 --> 01:04:05,936
You got everything figured out, right?
So tell me what comes next.

938
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:35,976
The third and final day
of the 22nd Bayhill Tournament...

939
01:04:36,077 --> 01:04:39,911
finds the host team, Bayhill,
trying to win the championship...

940
01:04:40,014 --> 01:04:42,812
against the surprising Richmond Oilers.

941
01:04:42,917 --> 01:04:45,715
Defense! Get your hands up.

942
01:04:50,258 --> 01:04:52,226
Get that ball!

943
01:04:58,466 --> 01:04:59,797
Time, ref.

944
01:05:02,403 --> 01:05:05,930
Richmond uses their last time-out
with 1:20 remaining...

945
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,508
in the fourth quarter
and Bayhill up by six.

946
01:05:08,609 --> 01:05:09,871
Time-out.

947
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,409
We're still in the game.

948
01:05:24,826 --> 01:05:26,487
Don't panic.

949
01:05:27,762 --> 01:05:29,855
We're six down with 1:20 left, all right?

950
01:05:29,964 --> 01:05:31,864
We've been in these guys' ass
the whole game.

951
01:05:31,966 --> 01:05:34,799
We can do this. This is our time, right?

952
01:05:34,902 --> 01:05:36,267
Yeah.

953
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:38,998
All right. Set up the one-four.
Run Candy.

954
01:05:39,107 --> 01:05:41,871
Damien's gonna hit the three.
Kenyon, Lyle...

955
01:05:41,976 --> 01:05:43,739
set a hard screen down here.

956
01:05:43,845 --> 01:05:46,507
When he hits the three,
go right into Diane.

957
01:05:46,614 --> 01:05:48,013
Pressure the inbound pass.

958
01:05:48,116 --> 01:05:51,517
Suffocate that pass.
I want the ball back!

959
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:53,553
- Come on, baby, lock up.
- Hands in.

960
01:05:53,654 --> 01:05:55,952
Let's go. "Our time" on three!

961
01:05:56,057 --> 01:05:57,524
- One, two, three!
- Our time!

962
01:05:57,625 --> 01:05:59,456
Come on, let's go.

963
01:06:07,201 --> 01:06:09,169
One, two, three, Cougars!

964
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:10,259
Let's go, guys!

965
01:06:17,378 --> 01:06:20,211
One-four! Candy!

966
01:06:20,715 --> 01:06:22,842
- Hands up.
- Ball.

967
01:06:24,552 --> 01:06:25,849
Watch him.

968
01:06:27,388 --> 01:06:29,185
- Watch your back. Come in.
- Take your time.

969
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:30,689
Watch the screen!

970
01:06:31,859 --> 01:06:33,952
Make the shot, Damien!

971
01:06:37,899 --> 01:06:39,526
Diane!

972
01:06:39,967 --> 01:06:42,367
Defense!

973
01:06:44,505 --> 01:06:46,132
Ball!

974
01:06:47,275 --> 01:06:49,539
- Right there. I got him.
- Ball.

975
01:06:51,379 --> 01:06:54,314
- Off him, ref.
- Richmond's ball!

976
01:07:00,721 --> 01:07:03,781
Kenyon! Hattie Jean!

977
01:07:03,991 --> 01:07:05,356
Hattie Jean!

978
01:07:06,194 --> 01:07:07,889
- "D" up!
- Check.

979
01:07:13,134 --> 01:07:14,362
Right there!

980
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:21,269
Delilah! Get back!

981
01:07:22,009 --> 01:07:23,499
Move your feet!

982
01:07:27,281 --> 01:07:28,646
Let's go!

983
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:31,044
Chop.

984
01:07:34,655 --> 01:07:36,350
A foul, ref!

985
01:07:40,728 --> 01:07:42,559
Right wing, Kenyon. Wing!

986
01:07:49,203 --> 01:07:52,536
And Richmond takes the lead
for the first time in the game.

987
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,505
Seventy-eight to 76.

988
01:08:00,181 --> 01:08:03,082
Slow the ball down!

989
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:05,743
Get back.

990
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:13,384
Defense!

991
01:08:19,567 --> 01:08:20,534
That's a charge! Driving!

992
01:08:21,535 --> 01:08:23,059
Basket's good!

993
01:08:25,273 --> 01:08:29,141
The basket counts and the Cougars
have tied the game.

994
01:08:29,977 --> 01:08:33,970
That was a bad call, ref!
Come on, guys.

995
01:08:36,817 --> 01:08:39,411
- Basket counts!
- That's a charge!

996
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,579
- Foul's on red five.
- Don't call me like that.

997
01:08:41,689 --> 01:08:42,656
On the block.

998
01:08:43,658 --> 01:08:46,593
- Coach! Please get back in the box!
- Please get in the box?

999
01:08:46,694 --> 01:08:49,356
Please get your head in the game!
Give me a break!

1000
01:08:49,664 --> 01:08:51,154
Cruz. In for Lyle.

1001
01:08:52,466 --> 01:08:53,728
Kenyon! Damien!

1002
01:08:53,834 --> 01:08:56,632
Sub, for five. Let's go.

1003
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:01,174
Listen, we got nine seconds left.
Get the ball, push it hard.

1004
01:09:01,275 --> 01:09:03,937
The ball's coming to you Kenyon.
Run Linda.

1005
01:09:04,045 --> 01:09:06,206
You be open, all right?
Let's go. You can do this.

1006
01:09:06,314 --> 01:09:08,145
Do it. Let's go. Come on, sirs. Hurry!

1007
01:09:08,382 --> 01:09:09,906
Let's go, guys! Let's go!

1008
01:09:11,519 --> 01:09:13,350
Let's go.

1009
01:09:15,256 --> 01:09:18,714
- One shot.
- Backboard "D"!

1010
01:09:30,771 --> 01:09:35,333
And the Bayhill Cougars take the lead
with nine seconds left.

1011
01:09:35,443 --> 01:09:38,469
Go to war, Miss Margaret,
this is a tight one.

1012
01:09:38,579 --> 01:09:42,481
Let's go! Linda!

1013
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:45,048
- Linda!
- Watch the pick.

1014
01:09:50,991 --> 01:09:53,653
Stop the ball!

1015
01:09:55,329 --> 01:09:57,797
It's not there, to the hole.

1016
01:09:59,567 --> 01:10:00,534
Watch it.

1017
01:10:03,404 --> 01:10:05,133
D up, man!

1018
01:10:31,832 --> 01:10:33,129
It's all right, man.

1019
01:10:34,969 --> 01:10:37,836
- Nice job, Coach.
- Nice game.

1020
01:10:37,938 --> 01:10:39,098
Thank you, sir.

1021
01:10:41,976 --> 01:10:44,843
- Rich what?
- Richmond!

1022
01:10:51,786 --> 01:10:55,153
- Line up! Let's shake hands.
- That's what I'm talking about, Coach.

1023
01:10:56,257 --> 01:10:57,724
Way to go, Lyle.

1024
01:10:58,192 --> 01:10:59,659
- Good game, Son.
- Love you, Dad.

1025
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,252
Ladies and gentlemen, I now present
the 22nd Annual Bayhill Tournament...

1026
01:11:03,364 --> 01:11:06,299
championship trophy
to Richmond High School.

1027
01:11:10,504 --> 01:11:12,597
Oh, yeah!

1028
01:11:27,988 --> 01:11:29,785
Hey, Number 3...

1029
01:11:34,929 --> 01:11:37,159
- nice game.
- Thank you.

1030
01:11:43,037 --> 01:11:44,334
Okay, cool.

1031
01:11:56,684 --> 01:11:57,981
Okay, come on.

1032
01:11:59,253 --> 01:12:00,777
Watch this door.

1033
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,879
Load up.

1034
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:48,019
Tonya, guess what?
We won the whole thing.

1035
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:52,286
That's right, 16-0.

1036
01:12:52,595 --> 01:12:56,759
Oh, and here's the best part:
Your second-favorite man was MVP.

1037
01:12:57,266 --> 01:13:00,360
Wait. I shouldn't tell you that.
He should tell you himself.

1038
01:13:00,469 --> 01:13:02,630
I'll wake him up so he can tell you.
Hold on.

1039
01:13:04,373 --> 01:13:07,467
Why don't you try their doorbell
with your ghetto self. Move.

1040
01:13:07,576 --> 01:13:09,203
Can you reach that?

1041
01:13:16,418 --> 01:13:18,818
- Look at this place.
- Glad you guys could come.

1042
01:13:18,921 --> 01:13:20,718
You know, we try to be up in here, baby.

1043
01:13:22,458 --> 01:13:25,791
- Yo.
- Yo, what's up? This is a nice crib.

1044
01:13:38,173 --> 01:13:40,733
Know what?
He must be in somebody else's room.

1045
01:13:54,256 --> 01:13:56,724
Like I was saying, I'm Junior Battle.
I'm the man.

1046
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,723
- That's what I'm talking about.
- I know.

1047
01:13:59,828 --> 01:14:02,160
- So you ain't got no boyfriend?
- Maybe.

1048
01:14:15,878 --> 01:14:16,845
Yo!

1049
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:21,142
- You looking for your team?
- Yes, sir.

1050
01:14:22,251 --> 01:14:26,119
Baby. Hard biz. Know what I'm saying?

1051
01:14:26,322 --> 01:14:30,418
This is my style right here.
I'm amazing. Feel me, Lyle?

1052
01:14:30,526 --> 01:14:33,620
- Hey, Lyle. Let me get a coochie juice.
- I got you, dog. I got you.

1053
01:14:34,263 --> 01:14:36,060
- Yo, Worm!
- What up, dog?

1054
01:14:36,165 --> 01:14:37,598
- Damien.
- Yo?

1055
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:38,860
I'm open.

1056
01:14:39,368 --> 01:14:40,699
Damien!

1057
01:14:43,939 --> 01:14:47,841
- Damien, are you drunk?
- No. I don't drink.

1058
01:14:49,044 --> 01:14:51,205
- Sorry about the thing.
- It's okay.

1059
01:14:51,313 --> 01:14:53,338
- I see you.
- I see you, too.

1060
01:14:53,449 --> 01:14:57,385
- I see her.
- Why don't we go swimming?

1061
01:14:57,553 --> 01:14:59,521
- We're going swimming?
- Yeah.

1062
01:14:59,655 --> 01:15:03,318
Hey, I'm going swimming!
I'm going swimming.

1063
01:15:05,127 --> 01:15:07,823
You're going swimming with the MVP!

1064
01:15:22,578 --> 01:15:24,569
This water's probably
cold as hell, shorty.

1065
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,114
I don't know.
And swimming ain't my cup of tea, baby.

1066
01:15:27,216 --> 01:15:29,150
- Know what I'm saying?
- Heated.

1067
01:15:29,251 --> 01:15:32,880
- Probably 90 degrees.
- We don't have bathing suits.

1068
01:15:32,988 --> 01:15:35,513
- Right.
- Neither do we.

1069
01:15:39,228 --> 01:15:40,525
So it's like that?

1070
01:15:40,629 --> 01:15:42,597
Show me the money, then,
know what I'm saying?

1071
01:15:42,698 --> 01:15:45,030
- Damn!
- Since it's like that.

1072
01:15:49,838 --> 01:15:52,864
- Yeah. Oh, damn.
- Oh, yeah.

1073
01:15:52,975 --> 01:15:54,738
Yeah, that's nice.

1074
01:15:55,511 --> 01:15:56,842
Damn.

1075
01:15:57,079 --> 01:15:58,842
You are looking right.

1076
01:15:59,515 --> 01:16:00,743
I like that.

1077
01:16:01,784 --> 01:16:03,445
You guys coming?

1078
01:16:03,652 --> 01:16:04,914
We're getting in there.

1079
01:16:06,355 --> 01:16:08,653
I gotta take my chain off
so it don't turn green.

1080
01:16:10,826 --> 01:16:15,490
Oh, man, I can't believe this. Heaven!

1081
01:16:37,319 --> 01:16:38,581
Excuse me.

1082
01:16:41,223 --> 01:16:43,748
- Can I help you?
- I'm Ken Carter...

1083
01:16:43,859 --> 01:16:45,952
coach of the
Richmond High basketball team.

1084
01:16:46,061 --> 01:16:49,258
Richmond?
You're a little lost, aren't you?

1085
01:16:49,364 --> 01:16:50,991
Well, I'm looking for my son.

1086
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:54,160
The cab driver told me he dropped
the team off here for a party.

1087
01:16:54,837 --> 01:16:56,031
Excuse me.

1088
01:17:10,352 --> 01:17:11,717
I'm telling you...

1089
01:17:31,607 --> 01:17:32,904
Piggyback!

1090
01:17:38,847 --> 01:17:42,339
- Oh, my God, is that...
- It's Susan's dad.

1091
01:17:42,551 --> 01:17:44,018
You see your son?

1092
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:46,585
Yes, sir, I do.

1093
01:17:52,628 --> 01:17:56,428
Damien Carter.
Get your ass out of that pool.

1094
01:17:58,167 --> 01:17:59,225
Yes, sir.

1095
01:17:59,802 --> 01:18:02,703
- Richmond High players, let's go.
- Hey, yo, Coach!

1096
01:18:03,272 --> 01:18:05,934
- Coach.
- Hey, Worm, where did you go?

1097
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:09,943
- Worm?
- What up, Coach?

1098
01:18:10,612 --> 01:18:13,843
I got somebody I want you to meet.
Now, I just met her...

1099
01:18:13,949 --> 01:18:18,010
but she is fine as hell. Her name is...

1100
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:21,578
- Susan.
- Susan. He right.

1101
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:24,318
- Shit.
- My daughter, Susan.

1102
01:18:26,128 --> 01:18:29,620
You are not going to like
what happens in practice on Monday.

1103
01:18:30,165 --> 01:18:33,726
You think you've run for me before?
I come to your rooms...

1104
01:18:33,836 --> 01:18:36,361
to celebrate with you, and you sneak...

1105
01:18:40,175 --> 01:18:42,973
I end up taking a road trip
to the suburbs...

1106
01:18:43,378 --> 01:18:46,142
where I find my drunk-ass point guard...

1107
01:18:46,248 --> 01:18:49,046
on top of Daddy's little princess.

1108
01:18:49,218 --> 01:18:52,016
Actually, I was on the bottom, Coach.
She was on the top.

1109
01:18:52,554 --> 01:18:56,923
Worm, do you wanna be on this team?
"Cause you're about six words...

1110
01:18:57,025 --> 01:19:00,517
from getting kicked off
and kicked off the goddamn bus.

1111
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:02,761
Cruz, open your eyes.

1112
01:19:04,233 --> 01:19:06,360
Ghetto hoop stars...

1113
01:19:06,468 --> 01:19:09,096
signing autographs
and humping the honeys.

1114
01:19:10,539 --> 01:19:12,939
Well, I'm gonna show you
what humping is.

1115
01:19:13,876 --> 01:19:16,606
Coach, we won the tournament.

1116
01:19:17,646 --> 01:19:20,444
We undefeated.
I mean, ain't that what you wanted?

1117
01:19:21,583 --> 01:19:22,641
Winners?

1118
01:20:36,591 --> 01:20:37,922
Oh, no.

1119
01:20:41,763 --> 01:20:44,095
Oh, no!

1120
01:20:48,870 --> 01:20:50,337
God!

1121
01:21:01,683 --> 01:21:03,412
You guys were awesome!

1122
01:21:06,621 --> 01:21:08,054
Yo, Damien. All right!

1123
01:21:17,466 --> 01:21:20,026
- What's up, Cruz?
- I don't know.

1124
01:21:20,669 --> 01:21:22,603
Coach giving us a day off, I guess.

1125
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:28,074
I don't even know
where the library's even at.

1126
01:21:28,176 --> 01:21:30,076
- I bet you don't.
- "Library's at"?

1127
01:21:30,178 --> 01:21:31,805
He don't know where the library's at.

1128
01:21:47,696 --> 01:21:51,393
Quiet.

1129
01:21:53,301 --> 01:21:57,897
Gentlemen, in this hand,
I hold contracts signed by me...

1130
01:21:58,006 --> 01:22:00,668
and signed by you. In this hand...

1131
01:22:00,876 --> 01:22:03,936
I hold academic progress reports
prepared by your teachers.

1132
01:22:05,013 --> 01:22:07,709
We have six players
failing at least one class.

1133
01:22:07,883 --> 01:22:11,910
Eight players getting "incompletes"
based on attendance.

1134
01:22:12,087 --> 01:22:14,385
Gentlemen, you have failed to...

1135
01:22:16,024 --> 01:22:19,551
No, I'm sorry. We have failed.

1136
01:22:20,595 --> 01:22:24,156
We have failed each other.
Now, there are some of you...

1137
01:22:24,266 --> 01:22:28,635
who have upheld this contract.
But know that we are a team.

1138
01:22:29,438 --> 01:22:32,066
And until we all meet
the terms of this contract...

1139
01:22:32,641 --> 01:22:35,132
- the gym will remain locked.
- Locked?

1140
01:22:35,243 --> 01:22:38,144
- What do you mean, locked?
- What, like for the day?

1141
01:22:38,246 --> 01:22:39,372
He must mean for the day.

1142
01:22:39,481 --> 01:22:42,211
Mr. Thompson, Mr. Gesek,
and Miss Sherman...

1143
01:22:42,317 --> 01:22:45,480
have generously volunteered their time
to help us reach our goals.

1144
01:22:45,587 --> 01:22:47,953
- But, Coach, I have a 3.3.
- That's good, sir.

1145
01:22:48,957 --> 01:22:50,948
Do you score all the points
for the team, too?

1146
01:22:54,196 --> 01:22:56,426
We are the Richmond Oilers.

1147
01:22:57,799 --> 01:22:59,824
Do you know what Oilers stands for?

1148
01:23:03,972 --> 01:23:05,098
Sir?

1149
01:23:06,575 --> 01:23:08,805
Know that you're not just walking out
on me...

1150
01:23:09,578 --> 01:23:13,605
- you're walking out on them.
- I had to beg you.

1151
01:23:16,151 --> 01:23:20,417
And then I ran all those sprints.
I did all that shit.

1152
01:23:21,156 --> 01:23:24,717
I killed myself for you, sir.
To get back on the team.

1153
01:23:28,797 --> 01:23:30,094
This is bullshit.

1154
01:23:53,522 --> 01:23:54,716
You put a lock on the gym...

1155
01:23:54,823 --> 01:23:56,814
and forced them
to meet you in the library?

1156
01:23:56,925 --> 01:23:58,984
- Are you crazy?
- Miss Garrison, I'm surprised...

1157
01:23:59,094 --> 01:24:00,618
you know where my office is.

1158
01:24:00,729 --> 01:24:03,721
Take the lock off that gym.
My phone hasn't stopped ringing.

1159
01:24:03,832 --> 01:24:05,925
Maybe someone on the other end
of that phone...

1160
01:24:06,034 --> 01:24:07,592
has a solution to our problem.

1161
01:24:07,702 --> 01:24:11,160
Your intentions are good, Mr. Carter,
but your methods are a bit extreme.

1162
01:24:11,273 --> 01:24:14,731
You painted an extreme picture.
No one expects them to graduate...

1163
01:24:14,843 --> 01:24:17,971
- no one expects them to go to college.
- So you take away basketball...

1164
01:24:18,079 --> 01:24:20,639
the one area of their lives
where they have some success?

1165
01:24:20,749 --> 01:24:23,047
- Yes, ma'am.
- And you challenge them academically?

1166
01:24:23,151 --> 01:24:25,051
- Yes, ma'am.
- And what if they fail?

1167
01:24:25,153 --> 01:24:26,518
Then we've failed.

1168
01:24:29,124 --> 01:24:31,422
Unfortunately, Mr. Carter,
both you and I know...

1169
01:24:31,526 --> 01:24:33,926
that for some of these kids,
this basketball season...

1170
01:24:34,029 --> 01:24:35,690
will be the highlight of their lives.

1171
01:24:37,265 --> 01:24:40,462
Well, I think that's the problem.
Don't you?

1172
01:25:06,027 --> 01:25:08,291
- Good morning, Coach Carter.
- Good morning.

1173
01:25:08,396 --> 01:25:11,797
- Quite the Pandora's box you've opened.
- Oh, I get all the blame now?

1174
01:25:11,933 --> 01:25:14,629
Let's just say I'm happy to give you
all the credit.

1175
01:25:14,736 --> 01:25:18,001
I've got every news reporter in town
waiting to speak to you.

1176
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:21,509
Got a press conference set up
around the front of the gymnasium.

1177
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:24,078
Coach Carter has taken the lockout
to the next level...

1178
01:25:24,179 --> 01:25:27,273
by canceling last night's game.
Richmond forfeited the game...

1179
01:25:27,382 --> 01:25:29,475
making it their first loss of the season.

1180
01:25:29,618 --> 01:25:31,586
And for now,
the lock remains on the gym.

1181
01:25:31,686 --> 01:25:33,313
Here he comes. Here he comes now.

1182
01:25:33,421 --> 01:25:35,855
Coach Carter! Coach!

1183
01:25:35,957 --> 01:25:39,415
- Can I get a question?
- Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

1184
01:25:39,527 --> 01:25:42,121
I'd like to thank you for your patience.
At this time...

1185
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:46,257
I'd like to introduce Coach Ken Carter.
You may direct your questions to him.

1186
01:25:46,735 --> 01:25:51,695
Mr. Carter, is it unfair to the players
whose grades qualify them to play?

1187
01:25:51,806 --> 01:25:53,706
Basketball's a team sport, sir.

1188
01:25:53,808 --> 01:25:55,901
We support each other
on and off the court.

1189
01:25:56,011 --> 01:25:58,070
Anybody still think Coach bluffing now?

1190
01:25:58,513 --> 01:26:01,710
I feel like running right up
in the middle of all those reporters...

1191
01:26:01,816 --> 01:26:04,080
and telling them I think
this is bullshit, son.

1192
01:26:04,185 --> 01:26:06,176
Maybe you should've gone
to class, Lyle.

1193
01:26:06,688 --> 01:26:09,623
Maybe you should kiss my ass, dog.
My grades are fine, homeboy.

1194
01:26:09,724 --> 01:26:11,351
It's Junior they should've locked out.

1195
01:26:11,459 --> 01:26:13,188
Maybe Junior
will kick your dumb ass out.

1196
01:26:13,295 --> 01:26:15,058
Why don't you try spelling it, then?

1197
01:26:15,163 --> 01:26:17,961
Chill man. Damn.
Junior, if you need help, I'll tutor you.

1198
01:26:18,066 --> 01:26:21,229
- Man, I don't need no help.
- He didn't lock us out for no reason.

1199
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:24,964
We been tripping lately, man.
All y'all know it.

1200
01:26:25,073 --> 01:26:27,371
How will the community react
to this lockout?

1201
01:26:27,475 --> 01:26:30,239
I'm not really sure.
I hope they'II support these young men.

1202
01:26:30,779 --> 01:26:34,545
- What, man?
- No, man, it's just funny, dog,'cause...

1203
01:26:34,649 --> 01:26:38,642
you thought it was bad all us knew
your dumb ass was failing science.

1204
01:26:38,753 --> 01:26:41,745
Now the whole world about to know
your dumb ass failing science.

1205
01:26:41,856 --> 01:26:44,347
Hey, man.

1206
01:26:46,061 --> 01:26:49,360
And you have Fremont this Saturday,
the biggest game on your schedule.

1207
01:26:49,464 --> 01:26:52,729
Now, Richmond is gonna riot
if you forfeit that game.

1208
01:26:53,535 --> 01:26:55,867
Saturday is a long way off.
We'II see what happens.

1209
01:26:55,970 --> 01:26:58,871
Thank you all for coming.
That's all the time I have right now.

1210
01:26:58,973 --> 01:27:02,374
- I have to get back to work.
- Coach, have you talked to the parents?

1211
01:27:03,645 --> 01:27:05,613
Thank you for your time,
ladies and gentlemen.

1212
01:27:05,714 --> 01:27:08,581
I'd like to remind you
that classes are in session...

1213
01:27:08,683 --> 01:27:11,277
so as you leave campus,
please do so quietly.

1214
01:27:12,721 --> 01:27:16,657
I ain't turning the cheek. He come up
in my 'hood, I'm serious, it's on.

1215
01:27:16,758 --> 01:27:20,353
Young sirs. It's been a long day.

1216
01:27:21,262 --> 01:27:23,992
Reporters. Media everywhere.

1217
01:27:24,566 --> 01:27:26,932
Let's take this time
to say whatever it is we want...

1218
01:27:27,035 --> 01:27:29,970
while the doors are closed.
You have the floor.

1219
01:27:30,505 --> 01:27:34,168
- This is about us.
- Man, this shit ain't about us.

1220
01:27:34,476 --> 01:27:37,604
- This is all about Coach Carter.
- We're the basketball team.

1221
01:27:38,146 --> 01:27:41,775
All I see is you on TV getting famous,
eating that shit up.

1222
01:27:41,883 --> 01:27:43,908
- Is that all you see?
- It's all I see.

1223
01:27:44,018 --> 01:27:47,920
- You ain't lying.
- Well, let me tell you what I see.

1224
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:53,092
I see a system
that's designed for you to fail.

1225
01:27:54,362 --> 01:27:56,853
Now, I know you all like stats,
so let me give you some.

1226
01:27:57,232 --> 01:28:00,463
Richmond High only graduates
50% of its students.

1227
01:28:01,269 --> 01:28:05,672
And of those that do graduate,
only six percent go to college.

1228
01:28:06,574 --> 01:28:08,735
Which tells me,
when I walk down these halls...

1229
01:28:08,843 --> 01:28:13,678
and I look in your classrooms,
maybe only one student...

1230
01:28:14,315 --> 01:28:16,340
is going to go to college.

1231
01:28:16,451 --> 01:28:20,148
"Well, damn, Coach Carter, if I ain't
going to college, where I'm gonna go?"

1232
01:28:20,321 --> 01:28:23,381
Now, that's a great question.
And the answer...

1233
01:28:23,491 --> 01:28:27,359
for young African-American men
in here, is this:

1234
01:28:28,263 --> 01:28:30,458
Probably to prison.

1235
01:28:30,565 --> 01:28:33,591
In this county, 33%...

1236
01:28:33,768 --> 01:28:38,171
of black males between 18 and 24
get arrested.

1237
01:28:40,442 --> 01:28:44,344
So look at the guy on your left.
Now look at the guy on your right.

1238
01:28:46,581 --> 01:28:48,208
One of you is gonna get arrested.

1239
01:28:49,584 --> 01:28:51,347
Growing up here in Richmond...

1240
01:28:51,453 --> 01:28:55,412
you're 80% more likely to go to prison
than college.

1241
01:28:56,825 --> 01:28:58,850
Those are the numbers.

1242
01:29:00,161 --> 01:29:02,152
Those are some stats for your ass.

1243
01:29:03,164 --> 01:29:07,396
Now, I want you to go home
and look at your lives tonight...

1244
01:29:08,837 --> 01:29:13,706
and look at your parents' lives
and ask yourself, "Do I want better?"

1245
01:29:15,443 --> 01:29:18,879
If the answer is yes,
I'll see you here tomorrow.

1246
01:29:20,915 --> 01:29:23,611
And I promise you...

1247
01:29:23,718 --> 01:29:26,312
I will do everything in my power...

1248
01:29:27,021 --> 01:29:30,479
to get you to college and to a better life.

1249
01:29:57,919 --> 01:30:00,911
I don't understand this.
It's a letter, how can it be a number?

1250
01:30:01,055 --> 01:30:04,422
How is balancing those equations
coming along?

1251
01:30:05,093 --> 01:30:07,857
Hold on.
Come on, son. Don't give up yet, son.

1252
01:30:08,096 --> 01:30:11,293
Here's a story out of California
that's getting national attention.

1253
01:30:11,399 --> 01:30:14,061
The entire boys basketball team
at Richmond High School...

1254
01:30:14,168 --> 01:30:15,601
has been benched.

1255
01:30:15,703 --> 01:30:18,501
The highly ranked Oilers
have a perfect season on the court...

1256
01:30:18,606 --> 01:30:21,040
but some players
were in big trouble academically.

1257
01:30:21,142 --> 01:30:25,272
And in an unprecedented move,
Coach Ken Carter canceled practice...

1258
01:30:25,413 --> 01:30:28,507
Iocked the gym and sent his players
straight to the library.

1259
01:30:28,616 --> 01:30:31,141
Now, at the start of the season,
I understand you made...

1260
01:30:31,252 --> 01:30:34,483
all of your players sign a contract
before they could join the team.

1261
01:30:34,589 --> 01:30:36,819
What exactly were the conditions
of that contract?

1262
01:30:36,925 --> 01:30:41,089
The contract states that the players
maintain a 2.3 grade point average.

1263
01:30:41,195 --> 01:30:43,720
And that the players
must attend all their classes...

1264
01:30:43,831 --> 01:30:45,992
and sit in the front row of those classes.

1265
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:50,161
Coach Carter, it's an unusual strategy,
and a risky one in a sense...

1266
01:30:50,271 --> 01:30:53,570
in light of your team's winning record.
But I think there's gonna be...

1267
01:30:53,675 --> 01:30:56,405
a lot of people pleased to learn
that at least somebody...

1268
01:30:56,511 --> 01:30:59,105
still cares about the concept of
the student athlete.

1269
01:30:59,213 --> 01:31:00,840
Thanks a lot for joining us today.

1270
01:31:07,055 --> 01:31:09,489
I'm so sorry to disturb you.
I'm Coach Ken Carter...

1271
01:31:09,591 --> 01:31:11,991
of the Richmond High School
basketball team.

1272
01:31:12,093 --> 01:31:14,721
- Oh, yeah.
- I need to ask you a favor.

1273
01:31:14,829 --> 01:31:18,265
My team is studying in the library,
and I've been trying to tell them...

1274
01:31:18,366 --> 01:31:20,891
that brains and beauty
are a perfect combination.

1275
01:31:21,002 --> 01:31:23,129
I'm just saying, I mean, I'm Worm, baby.

1276
01:31:23,237 --> 01:31:25,501
How would you like to watch
the Worm work?

1277
01:31:25,607 --> 01:31:28,872
Hey, where did you get that backpack?
Watch out, Too Short.

1278
01:31:28,977 --> 01:31:32,674
Why study earth science or history...

1279
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:34,304
or algebra?

1280
01:31:35,383 --> 01:31:40,116
Getting good grades in those subjects,
combined with basketball skills...

1281
01:31:40,221 --> 01:31:42,280
can get you into college.

1282
01:31:43,458 --> 01:31:46,154
Girl, you should've bought it.
I would've worn it.

1283
01:31:56,037 --> 01:31:59,131
You selfish son of a bitch. You snake.

1284
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:01,504
- Miss...
- No, don't "miss" me, snake.

1285
01:32:01,609 --> 01:32:02,906
Mr. Carter, you remember me?

1286
01:32:03,011 --> 01:32:05,980
After all the things that my son
has been through for your team...

1287
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,139
for you to go and lock up
this gym like this...

1288
01:32:08,249 --> 01:32:09,273
How dare you?

1289
01:32:25,166 --> 01:32:28,431
Open up the damn gym!
Let the boys play.

1290
01:32:34,008 --> 01:32:37,136
What's up, little cousin?
How you doing?

1291
01:32:38,379 --> 01:32:42,907
Got something for me?
That's what I'm talking about.

1292
01:32:53,327 --> 01:32:56,262
Hey, put it down, man.

1293
01:32:58,199 --> 01:32:59,894
- You Coach Carter, right?
- Yes, sir.

1294
01:33:00,001 --> 01:33:02,629
- Yeah? Check this out, man.
- Hey, hold on, man.

1295
01:33:02,737 --> 01:33:04,534
- Yeah. How you like that?
- Oh, hell, no.

1296
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:06,834
- What?
- You wanna get out the car?

1297
01:33:06,941 --> 01:33:09,307
- Let's talk about this.
- Ain't nothing to talk about.

1298
01:33:09,410 --> 01:33:11,742
Just open up the gym, man.
Let them boys play.

1299
01:33:13,281 --> 01:33:15,374
Trust me,
you don't want me out of this car.

1300
01:33:15,483 --> 01:33:18,111
- Yeah, see? Yeah.
- Get on.

1301
01:33:18,219 --> 01:33:20,380
Don't be no punk.
Say what you gotta say.

1302
01:33:20,488 --> 01:33:22,718
- Come on back, punk.
- Dad. Relax. Relax, let it go.

1303
01:33:22,824 --> 01:33:26,089
No, I ain't letting nothing go.
These people in Richmond...

1304
01:33:26,194 --> 01:33:28,458
- God damn it!
- Relax, Dad.

1305
01:33:28,563 --> 01:33:31,726
- Damn it!
- Relax. Chill out. It's over. All right?

1306
01:33:32,366 --> 01:33:34,061
He doesn't mean anything. It's over.

1307
01:33:34,936 --> 01:33:37,666
Let it go. Come on,
get back in the car. Let's go.

1308
01:34:56,851 --> 01:34:59,183
I think you know who she is,
but she's got a friend.

1309
01:34:59,287 --> 01:35:02,415
- I mean, dog, you gotta hook me up.
- Why I always gotta hook him up?

1310
01:35:02,523 --> 01:35:05,788
- Sound like I'm the Love Connection.
- Just start a conversation.

1311
01:35:05,893 --> 01:35:08,259
- I'll take care of it.
- Yeah. Yes, girl.

1312
01:35:08,362 --> 01:35:10,353
You don't remember me,
but I knew your cousin.

1313
01:35:10,464 --> 01:35:13,661
I was just ready to duff Duke out.
Some serious shit.

1314
01:35:13,768 --> 01:35:16,896
You should have did it, man.
You talking all that shit, just do it.

1315
01:35:17,004 --> 01:35:20,064
Know what I'm saying?
You let somebody do that to you.

1316
01:35:20,174 --> 01:35:21,732
- Oscar, man.
- What?

1317
01:35:21,843 --> 01:35:24,403
Don't go nowhere. I'll be right out.
I gotta talk to you.

1318
01:35:24,512 --> 01:35:27,970
- I already told you...
- No. You guys is kind of passing...

1319
01:35:28,082 --> 01:35:31,540
I know I'm fine. But I'm not feeling
myself. I'm feeling you.

1320
01:35:31,953 --> 01:35:35,286
Hey, I'm gonna holler at my boys
across the street for a quick minute.

1321
01:35:35,556 --> 01:35:37,456
- Come on, man. Hurry up, man.
- All right.

1322
01:35:37,558 --> 01:35:39,321
- You know who we are, then?
- Here they go.

1323
01:35:39,427 --> 01:35:43,158
What do we have here?
The Three Stooges from Richmond.

1324
01:35:43,264 --> 01:35:44,697
Larry, Co, and Dummy.

1325
01:35:44,799 --> 01:35:47,063
Dummy and dumb and dumber.
I mean, what the hell...

1326
01:35:47,168 --> 01:35:50,535
is the bitchman from Richmond
doing on our side of the turf?

1327
01:35:50,638 --> 01:35:53,038
You garbage. I can't believe y'all won.

1328
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:55,506
- Shut up, homey.
- Don't be...

1329
01:35:55,610 --> 01:35:59,910
- I don't understand how y'all won.
- Y'all wack-star niggers.

1330
01:36:00,014 --> 01:36:01,504
- Y'all wacked.
- Wacked.

1331
01:36:01,616 --> 01:36:03,447
Yo, shut your bitch ass up.

1332
01:36:03,551 --> 01:36:07,078
- I don't wanna hear you talking shit.
- Homey, you a benchwarmer!

1333
01:36:08,656 --> 01:36:11,682
Get the hell out my face, whitey!

1334
01:36:13,294 --> 01:36:15,592
Let's do it, homey.

1335
01:36:15,696 --> 01:36:17,755
- What you trying to do?
- He got a piece, man.

1336
01:36:17,865 --> 01:36:21,323
You feel me right now, huh?
You feel me right now?

1337
01:36:21,502 --> 01:36:24,096
- Y'all brought a gun.
- Pinole homey. Feel me?

1338
01:36:24,305 --> 01:36:26,705
Keep it up the block, homey.
I'm right here, homey.

1339
01:36:26,807 --> 01:36:28,866
I'm right here. Right here.

1340
01:36:29,076 --> 01:36:32,045
It's all good. Y'all brought a gun! Pinole!

1341
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:35,940
Bitch-ass. Pinole, right?

1342
01:36:37,385 --> 01:36:40,013
- Are they serious?
- I'll knock his braids out.

1343
01:36:41,289 --> 01:36:45,453
Nice to see the fight in you, dog.
Know what I'm saying?

1344
01:36:45,559 --> 01:36:47,026
- Appreciate the backup.
- Word.

1345
01:36:48,930 --> 01:36:50,488
I'm gonna see y'all later, all right?

1346
01:36:50,598 --> 01:36:52,429
- All right, homey.
- Good looking.

1347
01:36:52,533 --> 01:36:55,764
- No doubt. I'm gonna check y'all.
- You got this.

1348
01:36:55,870 --> 01:36:57,804
I don't have it this week, man.

1349
01:36:57,905 --> 01:37:00,203
This is my paper, man. I'm not playing.

1350
01:37:00,308 --> 01:37:02,435
Then why don't you stop
getting in my face?

1351
01:37:06,881 --> 01:37:08,212
Renny!

1352
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,991
I can't believe this, man.
He was just standing there.

1353
01:37:29,103 --> 01:37:30,570
- Renny!
- Oh, shit.

1354
01:37:30,671 --> 01:37:33,162
- Come on. Help me. Get 911.
- Call 911, man.

1355
01:37:33,274 --> 01:37:37,404
- Yo, I need a phone. I need something.
- I just need you to stay with me, okay?

1356
01:37:40,581 --> 01:37:42,242
Hold his head up.

1357
01:37:48,956 --> 01:37:50,924
Somebody help me!

1358
01:38:15,249 --> 01:38:16,876
- Cruz?
- I wanna come back, Coach.

1359
01:38:16,984 --> 01:38:19,248
- What's going on?
- I wanna come back on the team.

1360
01:38:22,189 --> 01:38:25,955
- What the hell happened?
- They shot him.

1361
01:38:28,329 --> 01:38:32,265
Renny. They shot Renny.
I mean, we was just there.

1362
01:38:33,467 --> 01:38:35,162
We was just there.
Everything was good.

1363
01:38:35,302 --> 01:38:37,600
- Come inside. Come on.
- Everything was good, Coach.

1364
01:38:37,705 --> 01:38:41,664
- I mean, you know...
- Come inside, son.

1365
01:38:42,176 --> 01:38:43,939
- Come on.
- You don't understand.

1366
01:38:45,079 --> 01:38:48,014
I wanna come back on the team.
What do I gotta do to play?

1367
01:38:48,115 --> 01:38:50,675
Don't worry about that, son.
Just come inside.

1368
01:38:57,091 --> 01:39:00,822
Whatever you want me to do,
I'll do it, okay?

1369
01:39:00,928 --> 01:39:05,024
Okay. I got you.

1370
01:39:05,132 --> 01:39:07,464
Come on, you're back with us now.

1371
01:39:07,568 --> 01:39:10,628
- I can't believe they shot him.
- Just come inside now, all right?

1372
01:39:11,372 --> 01:39:13,237
- Come on.
- I just wanna be on the team.

1373
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:16,639
- Come on.
- Whatever you want me to do...

1374
01:39:17,144 --> 01:39:18,907
I'll do it, okay?

1375
01:39:23,317 --> 01:39:26,377
The state only requires a 2.0 GPA
for participation...

1376
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:29,489
- in extracurricular activities.
- Yes, ma'am.

1377
01:39:29,590 --> 01:39:30,955
And according to your contract...

1378
01:39:31,058 --> 01:39:33,356
the players are agreeing
to maintain a 2.3?

1379
01:39:33,461 --> 01:39:35,588
That, among other things. Yes, ma'am.

1380
01:39:35,696 --> 01:39:38,164
- Other things like?
- Attending all classes...

1381
01:39:38,265 --> 01:39:41,860
sitting in the front row of those classes,
and wearing a tie on game day.

1382
01:39:42,503 --> 01:39:47,304
I see. Mr. Carter, does the lockout
include practices and games?

1383
01:39:47,541 --> 01:39:51,170
- And do you have a set period of time?
- There will be no basketball, ma'am.

1384
01:39:54,348 --> 01:39:56,976
Please! Quiet, please!

1385
01:39:57,485 --> 01:40:00,648
That includes practices and games,
until we as a team...

1386
01:40:00,754 --> 01:40:02,221
reach the agreed-upon GPA.

1387
01:40:03,324 --> 01:40:06,589
Please, quiet.

1388
01:40:07,328 --> 01:40:10,559
Quiet! Thank you, Mr. Carter.

1389
01:40:11,198 --> 01:40:14,861
In the interest of time, l'd like to open
this board meeting up for comments.

1390
01:40:15,369 --> 01:40:17,769
As a teacher, I was offended
when asked by a coach...

1391
01:40:17,872 --> 01:40:19,669
to provide progress reports.

1392
01:40:20,207 --> 01:40:23,734
Nowhere in my contract does it say
that I have to do so.

1393
01:40:23,844 --> 01:40:27,974
It creates more work. This lockout
has brought negative media attention...

1394
01:40:28,115 --> 01:40:31,084
that questions our abilities
as educators.

1395
01:40:31,218 --> 01:40:34,016
End this madness. End this lockout.

1396
01:40:37,191 --> 01:40:38,783
I'm Jason Lyle's uncle.

1397
01:40:38,893 --> 01:40:41,987
That boy lives to play ball.
Comes to school every day now.

1398
01:40:42,930 --> 01:40:46,866
You take away basketball,
God knows what he'd be into.

1399
01:40:48,702 --> 01:40:51,796
Yesterday, he canceled
the Fremont game.

1400
01:40:52,439 --> 01:40:54,202
Now, that's the biggest game
of the year.

1401
01:40:55,009 --> 01:40:56,909
I have scouts coming
to watch my boy play.

1402
01:40:57,011 --> 01:41:00,208
- Me, too.
- These boys are 16-0.

1403
01:41:00,314 --> 01:41:03,545
This whole school, this whole
community, is behind this team.

1404
01:41:07,221 --> 01:41:10,748
Everybody goes to every game.
Basketball is the only thing...

1405
01:41:10,858 --> 01:41:13,520
that these boys have got.
Now, are we gonna let Carter...

1406
01:41:13,627 --> 01:41:15,720
come in here
and take that away from them?

1407
01:41:15,829 --> 01:41:18,320
- No!
- I don't think so.

1408
01:41:18,432 --> 01:41:20,024
Not gonna happen.

1409
01:41:26,874 --> 01:41:28,102
I'd like to make a motion.

1410
01:41:28,776 --> 01:41:32,678
- Yes, Mr. Walters?
- I move that we remove Mr. Carter...

1411
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:34,247
as head basketball coach.

1412
01:41:38,085 --> 01:41:39,643
Please. Order.

1413
01:41:40,621 --> 01:41:42,418
This board does not have the authority...

1414
01:41:42,523 --> 01:41:44,821
to terminate employment
of a staff position.

1415
01:41:44,925 --> 01:41:48,452
Then I move we end the lockout
and let the kids play.

1416
01:41:50,497 --> 01:41:52,931
- I second the motion.
- Okay.

1417
01:41:53,033 --> 01:41:54,967
- If I may?
- Yes, Mr. Carter.

1418
01:41:55,569 --> 01:41:59,096
You need to consider the message
that you're sending these boys.

1419
01:41:59,707 --> 01:42:03,700
It's the same message that we as
a culture send to our pro athletes...

1420
01:42:03,978 --> 01:42:06,310
which is that they are above the law.

1421
01:42:07,047 --> 01:42:09,481
Now, I'm trying to teach
these boys the discipline...

1422
01:42:09,583 --> 01:42:11,881
that will inform their lives
and give them choices.

1423
01:42:12,653 --> 01:42:16,953
If you endorse the fact
that 15, 16, and 17-year-olds...

1424
01:42:17,057 --> 01:42:20,754
don't have to honor the simple rules
of a basketball contract...

1425
01:42:20,861 --> 01:42:24,319
how long do you think it'II be
before they're out there breaking laws?

1426
01:42:25,266 --> 01:42:28,133
Now, I played basketball at Richmond
30 years ago.

1427
01:42:28,369 --> 01:42:30,200
It was the same thing then.

1428
01:42:30,871 --> 01:42:33,135
Some of my teammates
ended up in prison.

1429
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:35,303
Some of them ended up dead.

1430
01:42:35,943 --> 01:42:38,912
I took this job because I wanted to
effect change...

1431
01:42:39,013 --> 01:42:42,278
in a special group of young men,
and this is the only way...

1432
01:42:42,383 --> 01:42:44,317
I know how to do that.

1433
01:42:46,153 --> 01:42:49,611
If you vote to end the lockout,
you won't have to terminate me...

1434
01:42:50,658 --> 01:42:51,625
I'll quit.

1435
01:42:51,725 --> 01:42:52,692
Good.

1436
01:42:55,729 --> 01:42:59,756
- Good.
- Thank you, Mr. Carter.

1437
01:43:02,936 --> 01:43:05,370
The board now recognizes
five voting members.

1438
01:43:05,939 --> 01:43:09,875
In this instance, we will be accepting
the vote of Principal Garrison as well.

1439
01:43:10,277 --> 01:43:14,043
Now, I put to those members
the vote on whether or not...

1440
01:43:14,148 --> 01:43:18,175
to end the lockout.
All those in favor of ending the lockout...

1441
01:43:18,285 --> 01:43:20,310
will raise their right hand
when called upon.

1442
01:43:21,755 --> 01:43:24,918
I will vote first by not raising my hand.

1443
01:43:26,827 --> 01:43:29,728
Principal Garrison?

1444
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:34,531
Valerie Walker.

1445
01:43:37,071 --> 01:43:38,231
Benson Chiu.

1446
01:43:41,041 --> 01:43:42,872
Parent rep, Mr. Cepeda.

1447
01:43:44,912 --> 01:43:46,277
And Miss Nyugen.

1448
01:43:47,514 --> 01:43:50,312
Thank you. Yes.

1449
01:44:04,698 --> 01:44:06,757
The lockout ends with a vote of 4-to-2.

1450
01:44:08,035 --> 01:44:11,095
If there's no other business,
this board meeting is adjourned.

1451
01:44:11,905 --> 01:44:13,873
Thank you all for coming.

1452
01:44:30,491 --> 01:44:34,188
Mr. Carter, are you sure
you wanna do this?

1453
01:44:37,431 --> 01:44:39,592
Look, I know we haven't always
seen eye to eye...

1454
01:44:39,700 --> 01:44:41,964
but you've done such a great job
with these boys...

1455
01:44:42,069 --> 01:44:44,833
- it seems wrong to just...
- Look. No offense, ma'am...

1456
01:44:44,938 --> 01:44:46,803
all the work I did with those boys...

1457
01:44:46,907 --> 01:44:49,000
was negated
when they ended the lockout.

1458
01:44:49,109 --> 01:44:51,703
- I don't think that's true.
- The board sent the message...

1459
01:44:51,812 --> 01:44:54,576
loud and clear. Winning basketball
games is more important...

1460
01:44:54,681 --> 01:44:58,208
than graduating from high school
and going to college. I'm sorry.

1461
01:44:58,552 --> 01:45:00,486
I just can't support that message.

1462
01:45:48,902 --> 01:45:52,963
Sir, they can cut the chain off the door,
but they can't make us play.

1463
01:45:56,510 --> 01:45:59,911
We've decided
we're gonna finish what you started, sir.

1464
01:46:01,515 --> 01:46:05,212
Yeah, so leave us be, Coach.
We got shit to do, sir.

1465
01:46:18,465 --> 01:46:20,592
"Our deepest fear
is not that we are inadequate.

1466
01:46:21,535 --> 01:46:24,197
"Our deepest fear is that
we are powerful beyond measure.

1467
01:46:25,305 --> 01:46:28,274
"It is our light, not our darkness
that most frightens us.

1468
01:46:29,209 --> 01:46:31,074
"Your playing small
does not serve the world.

1469
01:46:31,178 --> 01:46:33,271
"There is nothing enlightened
about shrinking...

1470
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:35,712
"so that other people
won't feel insecure around you.

1471
01:46:36,750 --> 01:46:39,310
"We were all meant to shine,
as children do.

1472
01:46:39,987 --> 01:46:42,217
"It is not just in some of us,
it is in everyone.

1473
01:46:43,490 --> 01:46:45,458
"And as we let our own light shine...

1474
01:46:45,659 --> 01:46:48,526
"we unconsciously give other people
permission to do the same.

1475
01:46:48,962 --> 01:46:51,055
"As we are liberated
from our own fear...

1476
01:46:52,332 --> 01:46:54,926
"our presence automatically
liberates others."

1477
01:47:01,074 --> 01:47:03,065
Sir, I just wanna say thank you.

1478
01:47:06,179 --> 01:47:07,476
You saved my life.

1479
01:47:16,924 --> 01:47:18,118
Thank you, sirs.

1480
01:47:21,862 --> 01:47:23,261
All of you.

1481
01:48:06,306 --> 01:48:09,002
Academic progress reports, young men.

1482
01:48:10,143 --> 01:48:12,236
These things are...

1483
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:14,642
unbelievable.

1484
01:48:16,049 --> 01:48:17,778
I know you've been trying.

1485
01:48:20,854 --> 01:48:23,152
I guess there's only one way to say this.

1486
01:48:25,792 --> 01:48:28,226
Gentlemen, we've reached our goal.
Let's play ball.

1487
01:48:35,969 --> 01:48:38,233
- Rich what?
- Richmond!

1488
01:49:07,934 --> 01:49:09,265
Get back.

1489
01:49:12,105 --> 01:49:13,072
Settle.

1490
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:14,600
Watch the baseline.

1491
01:49:20,447 --> 01:49:22,642
- Yes.
- Find a man.

1492
01:49:24,251 --> 01:49:27,584
Don't let up! Swing it.

1493
01:49:29,356 --> 01:49:30,323
Go!

1494
01:49:32,893 --> 01:49:34,019
Go!

1495
01:49:35,429 --> 01:49:36,691
Pick him up.

1496
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,405
Go Richmond.

1497
01:49:48,942 --> 01:49:51,274
Hold the ball.

1498
01:49:53,613 --> 01:49:58,016
9, 8, 7, 6, 5...

1499
01:49:58,118 --> 01:50:01,610
4, 3, 2, 1.

1500
01:50:10,597 --> 01:50:13,031
- Good game, Coach.
- Good game.

1501
01:50:16,636 --> 01:50:21,471
Richmond returns from their lockout
and keep their streak alive at 17 games.

1502
01:50:21,575 --> 01:50:24,373
A team that only won four games
last year...

1503
01:50:24,478 --> 01:50:25,968
is now a Cinderella team...

1504
01:50:26,079 --> 01:50:28,411
that has to be thinking
that there's a chance...

1505
01:50:28,515 --> 01:50:31,245
of getting the phone call
to come to the dance.

1506
01:50:31,384 --> 01:50:33,614
Is Richmond
headed for the State Tournament?

1507
01:50:46,066 --> 01:50:48,728
So, what else y'all gonna do
at the park when you go?

1508
01:50:48,835 --> 01:50:50,166
- Seesaw.
- Seesaw?

1509
01:50:51,071 --> 01:50:52,834
- You're gonna seesaw?
- Yeah.

1510
01:50:52,939 --> 01:50:53,997
Who's gonna push you?

1511
01:50:54,107 --> 01:50:56,701
- My mommy's gonna push me.
- Yeah?

1512
01:50:57,911 --> 01:51:00,141
That's good. I wish I could go with you.

1513
01:51:00,247 --> 01:51:02,738
- Come on, baby.
- But I'll see you later, okay?

1514
01:51:02,849 --> 01:51:04,407
- Okay.
- Bye.

1515
01:51:05,018 --> 01:51:06,918
- Bye.
- Bye.

1516
01:51:11,491 --> 01:51:15,393
- How you been?
- Good.

1517
01:51:16,897 --> 01:51:20,526
- You look good.
- Thank you.

1518
01:51:21,034 --> 01:51:23,434
So do you. Considering.

1519
01:51:28,875 --> 01:51:31,673
You know, everything's been crazy,
with the lockout.

1520
01:51:33,213 --> 01:51:36,307
- Yeah, it'II be all right.
- For sure.

1521
01:51:37,617 --> 01:51:39,608
Can we sit down somewhere?

1522
01:51:59,639 --> 01:52:02,972
I've been trying to get my head straight
about things.

1523
01:52:03,476 --> 01:52:05,808
A lot of things. Especially us.

1524
01:52:06,313 --> 01:52:10,545
- Kenny...
- Kyra, just listen. Please.

1525
01:52:13,286 --> 01:52:17,620
For a long time, it's just been
my moms, my boys, and you.

1526
01:52:18,725 --> 01:52:22,525
And that's what I counted on.
I'm trying to count on myself now...

1527
01:52:22,963 --> 01:52:25,227
and I'm all right and shit, it's just...

1528
01:52:25,999 --> 01:52:28,627
without you nothing good feels as good.

1529
01:52:31,204 --> 01:52:33,764
I'm missing some happy part of me.

1530
01:52:45,151 --> 01:52:46,550
I got you something.

1531
01:52:49,022 --> 01:52:53,925
- And it ain't from the 99-Cent Store.
- Shut up.

1532
01:52:58,698 --> 01:53:01,599
- They gave you a scholarship?
- Yeah, baby, a full ride.

1533
01:53:01,701 --> 01:53:05,535
Oh, my gosh. That is crazy.

1534
01:53:06,206 --> 01:53:10,540
Oh, my gosh.
I know you gonna kill it up there.

1535
01:53:10,644 --> 01:53:12,077
No, we gonna kill it up there.

1536
01:53:13,246 --> 01:53:16,010
I told them about you and the baby.
They wanna help us.

1537
01:53:28,061 --> 01:53:29,221
Kenyon...

1538
01:53:30,664 --> 01:53:31,995
there is no more baby.

1539
01:53:36,469 --> 01:53:38,596
I decided not to go through with it.

1540
01:53:43,510 --> 01:53:44,841
I had a choice to make...

1541
01:53:46,379 --> 01:53:49,871
so I made it. For me, Kenny.

1542
01:53:53,954 --> 01:53:55,819
Well, when...

1543
01:53:57,590 --> 01:54:00,115
Why didn't you tell me?
I would have gone with you.

1544
01:54:05,598 --> 01:54:07,623
I'm so sorry.

1545
01:54:08,735 --> 01:54:11,499
Kyra, I'm so sorry
you had to go through that by yourself.

1546
01:54:14,341 --> 01:54:15,933
My mom went with me.

1547
01:54:18,645 --> 01:54:22,103
But I think that...
I think you should go to school...

1548
01:54:22,615 --> 01:54:25,345
and play ball and do your thing.

1549
01:54:26,553 --> 01:54:30,922
You know? I want that for you.
And that's real.

1550
01:54:32,692 --> 01:54:34,523
I think you should be all you can.

1551
01:54:37,063 --> 01:54:38,655
I want you to come with me.

1552
01:54:42,202 --> 01:54:46,036
Kyra, I love you.
I want you to come with me.

1553
01:54:47,607 --> 01:54:49,666
- You serious?
- I'm serious.

1554
01:54:50,577 --> 01:54:52,511
- Oh, my God.
- I love you.

1555
01:54:53,046 --> 01:54:54,377
I love you, too.

1556
01:55:03,289 --> 01:55:04,347
Ken Carter.

1557
01:55:06,726 --> 01:55:10,719
I understand, sir.
All right. Thank you, sir.

1558
01:55:20,540 --> 01:55:21,768
- We're in.
- Yes!

1559
01:55:24,044 --> 01:55:25,602
That's what I'm talking about.

1560
01:55:31,151 --> 01:55:34,177
Guys, now, listen.

1561
01:55:34,921 --> 01:55:37,685
It's not gonna be easy.
It's gonna be a long road.

1562
01:55:38,124 --> 01:55:40,922
- We're a really low seed.
- Who did we get, Coach?

1563
01:55:43,096 --> 01:55:46,122
- St. Francis.
- St. Francis?

1564
01:55:46,566 --> 01:55:48,466
They're ranked number one in the state.

1565
01:55:50,870 --> 01:55:53,338
Hey, yo, Junior, man,
don't worry about Ty Crane, dog.

1566
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:54,873
- You'II get him.
- We got this.

1567
01:55:54,974 --> 01:55:57,943
- That's all right, baby.
- One game at a time. We got this.

1568
01:55:58,044 --> 01:55:59,602
- All right, guys.
- It's on.

1569
01:56:08,955 --> 01:56:11,583
- Bring your "A" game, young man.
- Yes, sir.

1570
01:56:43,490 --> 01:56:47,722
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to the first round of the CIF playoffs.

1571
01:56:47,827 --> 01:56:50,990
St. Francis is one of the best
high school teams in the nation...

1572
01:56:51,097 --> 01:56:55,966
with Ty Crane believed to be a shoo-in
for the top NBA draft pick next year.

1573
01:56:56,469 --> 01:56:58,903
On the other side of the court
is Richmond...

1574
01:56:59,005 --> 01:57:01,599
a team that's had
a media-worthy season as well.

1575
01:57:01,708 --> 01:57:04,802
Richmond High has never played
in a state tournament.

1576
01:57:04,911 --> 01:57:06,936
Let's go.

1577
01:57:12,752 --> 01:57:13,119
- All right. Settle down.
- One-four.

1578
01:57:13,119 --> 01:57:15,349
- All right. Settle down.
- One-four.

1579
01:57:18,858 --> 01:57:20,052
Ball.

1580
01:57:20,793 --> 01:57:22,055
Move!

1581
01:57:26,966 --> 01:57:28,058
Good shot, baby.

1582
01:57:29,836 --> 01:57:30,996
Get back.

1583
01:57:31,971 --> 01:57:34,337
Run motion. Motion 44.

1584
01:57:35,608 --> 01:57:38,736
- Defense!
- Right here.

1585
01:57:38,845 --> 01:57:40,608
Swing it.

1586
01:57:43,483 --> 01:57:44,643
Force him left.

1587
01:57:50,423 --> 01:57:53,324
You gotta force him left.
The baseline's another defender.

1588
01:57:56,262 --> 01:57:57,559
"D" up!

1589
01:58:03,469 --> 01:58:06,597
You better get somebody else
to hold me. I'm dropping 50 tonight.

1590
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:08,702
Set up!

1591
01:58:13,313 --> 01:58:15,144
Get on him!

1592
01:58:16,382 --> 01:58:18,475
Get over here and help.
He shouldn't be scoring.

1593
01:58:18,585 --> 01:58:20,644
- Yeah!
- Get back, get back.

1594
01:58:23,256 --> 01:58:26,714
- Find your man!
- Now, watch out. Watch that trap.

1595
01:58:27,427 --> 01:58:29,827
Watch the trap motion.

1596
01:58:29,929 --> 01:58:33,092
- That's the one.
- That's it.

1597
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:38,162
- Yes!
- S-C-O-R-E, Score!

1598
01:58:41,441 --> 01:58:42,738
Ball, man!

1599
01:58:48,181 --> 01:58:49,671
We'II take that!

1600
01:58:49,782 --> 01:58:52,580
Lyle, stop the ball. Less talk out there.

1601
01:59:03,029 --> 01:59:07,261
Come on. Let's go, Richmond!

1602
01:59:07,367 --> 01:59:10,063
You gotta help Junior
on the weak-side pick.

1603
01:59:14,741 --> 01:59:17,232
- Delilah!
- Defense!

1604
01:59:24,651 --> 01:59:27,119
- Get there.
- Trap, trap. Left side!

1605
01:59:39,399 --> 01:59:41,128
Use the pick.

1606
01:59:41,234 --> 01:59:42,724
I got it.

1607
01:59:45,438 --> 01:59:46,530
Yeah!

1608
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:49,005
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Foul, Number 3.

1609
01:59:49,108 --> 01:59:52,009
- Huddle up.
- Mustangs, bring it in.

1610
01:59:52,111 --> 01:59:55,706
- Count the basket.
- Time-out, sir. Time.

1611
01:59:55,815 --> 01:59:58,283
Come here, come here! Damn it.

1612
01:59:58,685 --> 02:00:01,916
Come on, guys, keep up the defense!

1613
02:00:02,021 --> 02:00:04,615
Come on, what you gonna do?

1614
02:00:05,992 --> 02:00:07,687
We still in this game. Come on, fellas.

1615
02:00:09,195 --> 02:00:12,289
Gentlemen, you told me
you deserved to be here!

1616
02:00:12,498 --> 02:00:14,329
Well, you're not playing like it!

1617
02:00:14,767 --> 02:00:17,668
All season long we played our game!

1618
02:00:17,770 --> 02:00:22,139
Right now, you're playing theirs.
When we step on the floor...

1619
02:00:22,241 --> 02:00:26,439
every second that clock is ticking,
we are pedal to the metal!

1620
02:00:26,546 --> 02:00:29,344
We run the ball. We pressure the ball!

1621
02:00:29,449 --> 02:00:34,148
And most importantly,
we control the tempo of the game!

1622
02:00:34,954 --> 02:00:38,446
We make them play
Richmond Oiler ball!

1623
02:00:39,726 --> 02:00:41,523
Worm, you can take this kid!

1624
02:00:41,761 --> 02:00:44,958
Force him left, and when
he crosses over, you jump him!

1625
02:00:45,064 --> 02:00:49,228
Damien, push the tempo.
Kenyon, Lyle, crash the boards!

1626
02:00:49,502 --> 02:00:53,438
Cruz, when you're in the game
in transition, take that jumper you love!

1627
02:00:53,573 --> 02:00:56,041
Junior, just keep doing
what you're doing.

1628
02:00:56,142 --> 02:00:58,076
Hold on to that monster.

1629
02:00:58,177 --> 02:01:01,738
You do those things, gentlemen,
and I guarantee you...

1630
02:01:01,848 --> 02:01:04,544
at the end of the game, we will be there!

1631
02:01:08,154 --> 02:01:11,146
- All right, hands in.
- Game time.

1632
02:01:11,257 --> 02:01:14,590
All right, take control of this game.
Who's gonna win this game?

1633
02:01:14,694 --> 02:01:16,321
- One, two, three.
- Richmond!

1634
02:01:16,429 --> 02:01:18,260
Let's go. Let's do this.

1635
02:01:22,335 --> 02:01:25,133
One, two, three, Mustangs!

1636
02:01:32,145 --> 02:01:33,112
Get up.

1637
02:01:33,346 --> 02:01:34,472
Go.

1638
02:01:39,719 --> 02:01:40,686
Yeah!

1639
02:01:42,822 --> 02:01:43,789
Yes.

1640
02:01:45,358 --> 02:01:46,655
There he is.

1641
02:01:47,593 --> 02:01:50,118
- Reach-in foul.
- That's the only damn one.

1642
02:01:50,229 --> 02:01:52,993
- How you gonna call that on me, ref?
- Good call, ref.

1643
02:01:54,033 --> 02:01:56,661
Cruz. In for Kenyon.

1644
02:01:59,272 --> 02:02:02,298
- Ball!
- Run it.

1645
02:02:16,522 --> 02:02:19,252
Get back, get back! Everybody get back!

1646
02:02:19,358 --> 02:02:21,292
Yeah! Come on!

1647
02:02:35,842 --> 02:02:38,333
- Damn.
- "D" up.

1648
02:02:40,213 --> 02:02:43,046
- Yeah!
- Get back.

1649
02:02:52,558 --> 02:02:54,617
Ref, you gotta call that.
This is my house.

1650
02:02:54,727 --> 02:02:56,456
- Push, push.
- Can we get a call?

1651
02:03:04,937 --> 02:03:07,735
Take care of the ball, man.
I'm gonna catch my breath.

1652
02:03:13,112 --> 02:03:14,170
Yeah!

1653
02:03:17,383 --> 02:03:19,010
Come on, get back!

1654
02:03:23,122 --> 02:03:25,716
Swing it right here. I got it.

1655
02:03:29,295 --> 02:03:30,592
Charge.

1656
02:03:32,865 --> 02:03:34,765
- Go get them, boys.
- Yeah, baby.

1657
02:03:34,867 --> 02:03:36,835
Charge, Number 30.

1658
02:03:36,936 --> 02:03:39,564
- Red ball.
- Come on, ref, you wasn't even there.

1659
02:03:45,678 --> 02:03:48,704
- Red ball, red ball. Red.
- Yes.

1660
02:03:49,415 --> 02:03:51,042
- Richmond's ball.
- What?

1661
02:03:51,150 --> 02:03:52,412
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

1662
02:04:00,726 --> 02:04:02,921
- Red ball.
- Junior, good block!

1663
02:04:03,229 --> 02:04:05,254
- I know that's a foul.
- It's all ball.

1664
02:04:05,998 --> 02:04:08,762
- What are you talking about?
- What's up, man? Back up.

1665
02:04:09,201 --> 02:04:10,429
Hey!

1666
02:04:11,871 --> 02:04:13,270
Knock his bitch ass out.

1667
02:04:13,839 --> 02:04:15,864
Calm down, man.
We're still in the game.

1668
02:04:16,175 --> 02:04:18,735
- Come on.
- Ease back.

1669
02:04:18,844 --> 02:04:20,539
Bring it in.

1670
02:04:22,515 --> 02:04:26,042
Get out of my way, man. Get off me.
It's just a bad call.

1671
02:04:26,352 --> 02:04:27,614
Let's go.

1672
02:04:29,088 --> 02:04:31,852
All right, baby, it's all us now.
It's all us. Let's go.

1673
02:04:41,267 --> 02:04:43,098
They're standing on the edge of a cliff...

1674
02:04:43,202 --> 02:04:46,262
all we gotta do is push them off.
We're gonna run Candy.

1675
02:04:46,372 --> 02:04:48,272
Worm, you gotta sell them the pass
to Damien.

1676
02:04:48,374 --> 02:04:51,002
Junior, we come to you
on the weak-side seal.

1677
02:04:51,110 --> 02:04:53,442
But, gentlemen,
just because you deserve this...

1678
02:04:53,546 --> 02:04:55,309
doesn't mean
they're gonna give it to you.

1679
02:04:55,414 --> 02:04:59,214
Sometimes you gotta take what's yours.
You ready to do this?

1680
02:04:59,352 --> 02:05:01,217
- Hell, yeah.
- Let's go.

1681
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:03,220
- All right, hands in.
- Come on, take this.

1682
02:05:03,322 --> 02:05:05,916
- Richmond on three.
- One, two, three, Richmond!

1683
02:05:06,025 --> 02:05:10,894
- Let's go!
- One, two, three, Mustangs!

1684
02:05:12,632 --> 02:05:14,395
Careful of the foul, all right? Let's go.

1685
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:17,799
- I got you.
- One-four! All right.

1686
02:05:17,903 --> 02:05:21,168
Defense! Mustangs! Let's go!

1687
02:05:24,510 --> 02:05:26,671
Candy!

1688
02:05:30,449 --> 02:05:31,711
Ball, Damien.

1689
02:05:37,323 --> 02:05:39,621
- Move.
- Help!

1690
02:05:52,638 --> 02:05:53,900
Junior, get back!

1691
02:05:56,175 --> 02:05:57,836
Get back, get back!

1692
02:06:02,615 --> 02:06:04,207
Junior, get back!

1693
02:06:15,061 --> 02:06:17,154
Hands up!

1694
02:06:31,243 --> 02:06:33,609
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about,
baby. Yeah!

1695
02:06:33,713 --> 02:06:35,078
I'll take it home.

1696
02:06:35,181 --> 02:06:37,706
Yeah! Mustangs!

1697
02:07:28,567 --> 02:07:29,761
Yeah!

1698
02:07:30,369 --> 02:07:32,633
Hold on, let me down.

1699
02:07:32,738 --> 02:07:34,228
Battle!

1700
02:07:36,375 --> 02:07:39,367
You're real, man. I mean that. All right?

1701
02:07:40,079 --> 02:07:42,172
All right? Keep your head up, baby.

1702
02:07:55,361 --> 02:07:57,955
Well, not quite
your storybook ending, huh?

1703
02:07:58,931 --> 02:08:01,126
Not for us, anyway.

1704
02:08:03,102 --> 02:08:06,094
But you men played like champions.

1705
02:08:07,006 --> 02:08:08,633
You never gave up.

1706
02:08:09,408 --> 02:08:11,968
And champions hold their heads high.

1707
02:08:13,679 --> 02:08:16,978
What you achieved goes way beyond
the win-Ioss column...

1708
02:08:17,082 --> 02:08:19,107
or what's gonna be written
on the front page...

1709
02:08:19,218 --> 02:08:21,186
of the sports section tomorrow.

1710
02:08:22,054 --> 02:08:24,648
You've achieved something
that some people spend...

1711
02:08:24,757 --> 02:08:26,452
their whole lives trying to find.

1712
02:08:27,927 --> 02:08:29,519
What you achieved...

1713
02:08:29,762 --> 02:08:32,856
is that ever-elusive victory within.

1714
02:08:35,034 --> 02:08:36,092
And, gentlemen...

1715
02:08:37,703 --> 02:08:40,365
I am so proud of you.

1716
02:08:44,443 --> 02:08:47,435
Four months ago, when I took the job
at Richmond, I had a plan.

1717
02:08:49,014 --> 02:08:50,572
That plan failed.

1718
02:08:51,684 --> 02:08:56,519
I came to coach basketball players,
and you became students.

1719
02:08:57,823 --> 02:08:59,688
I came to teach boys...

1720
02:09:00,893 --> 02:09:04,693
and you became men.
And for that, I thank you.

1721
02:09:09,068 --> 02:09:11,434
If someone walked in this door
right now...

1722
02:09:12,271 --> 02:09:16,970
and offered me the coaching job
at any school in the state of California...

1723
02:09:18,143 --> 02:09:19,770
you know which team l'd choose?

1724
02:09:21,080 --> 02:09:22,513
St. Francis?

1725
02:09:23,682 --> 02:09:27,516
- I'm just saying, man.
- Kenyon?

1726
02:09:32,958 --> 02:09:34,926
- Richmond?
- Rich what?

1727
02:09:36,362 --> 02:09:38,057
- Richmond.
- Rich what?

1728
02:09:38,464 --> 02:09:41,024
- Richmond.
- Rich what?

1729
02:09:41,467 --> 02:09:43,867
- Richmond.
- Where we from?

1730
02:09:43,969 --> 02:09:46,096
- Richmond!
- What's my hometown?

1731
02:09:46,472 --> 02:09:48,667
- Richmond!
- What do we love?

1732
02:09:48,874 --> 02:09:50,842
- Richmond!
- Rich what?

1733
02:09:51,010 --> 02:09:52,841
Richmond!
