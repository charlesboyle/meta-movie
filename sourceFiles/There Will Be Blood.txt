1
00:04:56,656 --> 00:04:57,714
No!

2
00:05:31,357 --> 00:05:33,621
There she is. There she is.

3
00:05:42,935 --> 00:05:44,459
There she is.

4
00:14:33,132 --> 00:14:35,123
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,

5
00:14:35,267 --> 00:14:39,397
<i>I've traveled over half our state
to be here tonight.

6
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:42,030
<i>I couldn't get away sooner
because my new well was coming in

7
00:14:42,141 --> 00:14:45,042
<i>at Coyote Hills
and I had to see about it.

8
00:14:45,144 --> 00:14:48,136
<i>That well is now flowing
at 2,000 barrels

9
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,443
<i>and it's paying me an income
of $5,000 a week.

10
00:14:52,117 --> 00:14:55,416
I have two others drilling
and I have 16 producing at Antelope,

11
00:14:55,554 --> 00:14:59,957
so, ladies and gentlemen,
if I say I'm an oilman, you will agree.

12
00:15:02,795 --> 00:15:05,457
Now, you have a great chance here,

13
00:15:05,597 --> 00:15:08,464
but bear in mind you could lose it all
if you're not careful.

14
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,966
Out of all men that beg for a chance
to drill your lots,

15
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:14,300
maybe one in twenty will be oilmen.

16
00:15:14,406 --> 00:15:15,634
The rest will be speculators,

17
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:18,266
that's men trying to get between
you and the oilmen

18
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:21,972
to get some of the money that ought,
by rights, come to you.

19
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:25,016
Even if you find one that has money
and means to drill,

20
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,584
he'll maybe know nothing about drilling.

21
00:15:27,686 --> 00:15:29,654
He'll have to hire the job out
on contract,

22
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:32,586
and then you're depending
on a contractor,

23
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:33,749
who'll rush the job through

24
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:35,952
so he can get another contract
just as quick as he can.

25
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,619
This is the way that this works.

26
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,995
What is your offer? We're wasting time.

27
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,267
Please!

28
00:15:45,504 --> 00:15:47,438
I do my own drilling.

29
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:51,975
And the men that work for me,
work for me, and they are men I know.

30
00:15:52,111 --> 00:15:55,808
I make it my business to be there
and to see their work.

31
00:15:55,948 --> 00:15:59,008
I don't lose my tools in the hole
and spend months fishing for them.

32
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:00,277
I don't botch the cementing off

33
00:16:00,386 --> 00:16:03,947
and let water in the hole
and ruin the whole lease.

34
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,080
I'm a family man.

35
00:16:06,191 --> 00:16:10,821
I run a family business. This is my son
and my partner, H.W. Plainview.

36
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:16,631
We offer you the bond of family
that very few oilmen can understand.

37
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:21,664
I'm fixed like no other company
in this field

38
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:24,970
and that's because
my Coyote Hills well has just come in.

39
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,544
I have a string of tools
all ready to put to work.

40
00:16:27,646 --> 00:16:29,773
I can load a rig onto trucks
and have them here in a week.

41
00:16:29,915 --> 00:16:32,975
I have business connections,
so I can get the lumber for the derricks.

42
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:36,884
Such things go by friendship
in a rush like this.

43
00:16:37,022 --> 00:16:40,856
And this is why I can guarantee
to start drilling

44
00:16:40,993 --> 00:16:43,928
and to put up the cash to back my word.

45
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:45,587
I assure you, ladies and gentlemen,

46
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:48,996
no matter what the others
promise to do,

47
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:52,535
when it comes to the showdown,
they won't be there.

48
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:56,775
Sit down! Sit down, you have no right...

49
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:58,610
Let us discuss what the man has to say.

50
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,804
Let us discuss what the man has to say.

51
00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:02,904
- Prescott, do you trust this man?
- Let's discuss what he has to say.

52
00:17:03,015 --> 00:17:06,473
- There's logic to what he's saying.
- How does he know? My lot is there!

53
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,448
Two or three years,
it could be ten years!

54
00:17:11,557 --> 00:17:14,685
- We gain nothing by losing our heads!
- Look at that well out there!

55
00:17:14,793 --> 00:17:16,317
Nobody's losing their heads.

56
00:17:17,296 --> 00:17:19,856
You have no business being here!

57
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,301
Sit that woman down, sir!

58
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,335
You can sit down.

59
00:17:26,472 --> 00:17:28,940
Mr. Plainview! Please, Mr. Plainview.

60
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:32,033
No, Mr. Plainview!
No, where are you going?

61
00:17:32,144 --> 00:17:35,238
- I don't need the lease. Thank you.
- But we need you.

62
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:37,577
Too much confusion.
Thank you for your time.

63
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:39,344
No, no, there's no confusion.

64
00:17:39,485 --> 00:17:43,148
I wouldn't take the lease
if you gave it to me as a gift.

65
00:17:53,832 --> 00:17:56,596
<i>Mr. Bankside,
I'm not going to waste your time.

66
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:59,170
<i>I'd certainly appreciate it
if you didn't waste mine.

67
00:17:59,271 --> 00:18:04,004
Now, if you wish to sign with me, we
can have a well drilling within 10 days.

68
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:07,510
Your lot is further north
from the discovery well up here.

69
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,204
That means
we'll probably have to dig deeper.

70
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:12,715
And if there's as much oil here
as I think there is,

71
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:15,843
it'll be harder to reach, but once
we find it, we can take it right out.

72
00:18:15,954 --> 00:18:20,550
We have to act quickly, because
very soon these fields will be dry.

73
00:18:20,692 --> 00:18:22,990
I need you to know what you want to do.

74
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:26,121
Now, because of the distance
from the discovery well,

75
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:28,495
I'll pay you a smaller royalty
than you'd get down there

76
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,434
but I'm prepared to give you
a $1,000 bonus on your lot.

77
00:18:32,538 --> 00:18:34,096
What kind of royalty
are you talking about?

78
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:38,643
One-sixth, plus a guarantee
to start drilling within 10 days.

79
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:41,975
Now, that's something
you won't find anywhere else.

80
00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:52,857
What age are your children, ma'am?

81
00:18:52,991 --> 00:18:54,686
Ten and twelve.

82
00:18:55,827 --> 00:18:59,695
Mr. Plainview, a question, sir.
Where is your wife?

83
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,666
She died in childbirth, Mrs. Bankside.

84
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:08,069
So it's just me and my son now.

85
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:16,812
It's coming in, boss!

86
00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:18,546
Hear it?

87
00:19:44,843 --> 00:19:46,538
Mr. Plainview?

88
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:47,873
Yes?

89
00:19:50,115 --> 00:19:52,208
Are you Daniel Plainview?

90
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,245
Yes.

91
00:19:56,922 --> 00:19:58,890
What can I do for you?

92
00:20:00,726 --> 00:20:02,523
You look for oil.

93
00:20:03,762 --> 00:20:05,229
That's right.

94
00:20:05,364 --> 00:20:08,390
What do you pay for a place that has it?

95
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:11,525
- Well, that depends.
- What does it depend on?

96
00:20:13,572 --> 00:20:15,403
On a lot of things.

97
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:21,335
If I told you I knew a place that had oil
where land could be bought cheaply,

98
00:20:21,446 --> 00:20:24,210
what do you think that would be worth?

99
00:20:25,217 --> 00:20:29,449
I think that you should let me know
what you know

100
00:20:29,554 --> 00:20:32,682
and then we'll try
and work something out.

101
00:20:34,726 --> 00:20:36,853
- Can I sit down?
- Please.

102
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:50,304
What church do you belong to?

103
00:20:56,014 --> 00:20:57,311
I...

104
00:20:59,484 --> 00:21:02,976
I enjoy all faiths. I don't belong
to one church in particular.

105
00:21:03,121 --> 00:21:07,114
I like them all. I like everything.
Where are you from?

106
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:11,093
That would be telling you.
That's what I want to sell you.

107
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:16,225
What are you doing in Signal Hill?

108
00:21:16,335 --> 00:21:18,735
We have oil,
and it seeps through the ground.

109
00:21:18,837 --> 00:21:20,395
Do you want to pay me
to know where it is?

110
00:21:20,505 --> 00:21:21,563
Just 'cause there's something
on the ground

111
00:21:21,673 --> 00:21:23,436
doesn't mean
there's anything beneath it.

112
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:26,272
Why did Standard Oil buy up land?

113
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:30,712
Is it in California?

114
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,778
- Maybe.
- How much land did they buy?

115
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,321
I'd like it better
if you didn't think I was stupid.

116
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:49,097
Why did you come to me?

117
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:53,534
- You just brought this well in.
- That's right.

118
00:21:53,638 --> 00:21:57,938
Yes, so just give me $500 in cash
right now

119
00:21:58,076 --> 00:22:00,510
and I'll tell you where it is.

120
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:02,876
I'll tell you what I'll do, son.
I'll give you $100 now,

121
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:07,611
and if it proves to be a promising lease,
then give you a $1,000 bonus.

122
00:22:07,753 --> 00:22:09,687
Six hundred dollars.

123
00:22:12,524 --> 00:22:15,391
Tell me one thing to help me decide.
What else have you got up there?

124
00:22:15,494 --> 00:22:17,189
What do you grow?

125
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:21,026
We have a big ranch,
but it's mostly rocks.

126
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:23,601
Plant things.
Nothing will grow but weeds.

127
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:24,929
What makes you think it's up?

128
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,130
Is there sulfur around?
Or alkali deposits?

129
00:22:28,273 --> 00:22:31,299
Alkali nearby. I don't know sulfur.

130
00:22:37,883 --> 00:22:39,680
Is that your son?

131
00:22:40,118 --> 00:22:41,415
Yes.

132
00:22:42,754 --> 00:22:44,016
- Hi.
- Hi.

133
00:22:47,225 --> 00:22:50,058
- Who are you?
- I'm Fletcher Hamilton.

134
00:22:50,195 --> 00:22:52,163
Nice to meet you, son.
What's your name?

135
00:22:52,264 --> 00:22:53,891
What do you do?

136
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,993
I work with Mr. Plainview.

137
00:22:57,702 --> 00:22:59,431
Here's $500, son.

138
00:22:59,571 --> 00:23:03,405
You tell me something worth hearing,
this money's yours.

139
00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:11,247
I come from a town called Little Boston
in Isabella County.

140
00:23:13,418 --> 00:23:17,855
This is us, here.
Spur station here at Little Boston.

141
00:23:17,956 --> 00:23:20,948
The Sunday ranch
is what you're looking for.

142
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,289
There's a sheep trail
that takes you there.

143
00:23:23,395 --> 00:23:26,364
It's a mile out of town headed west,
not far.

144
00:23:26,498 --> 00:23:30,400
Just through a small pass here
near the base of the hills.

145
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:34,232
You'll pass a church
and just follow the sheep trail.

146
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:38,502
- Where's Standard buying up?
- Here and here.

147
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:43,113
- Your family name is Sunday, yes?
- That's right.

148
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:44,682
How many's in your family?

149
00:23:44,816 --> 00:23:48,013
My father and mother and sisters
and my brother Eli.

150
00:23:48,153 --> 00:23:50,815
- How many sisters do you have?
- Two.

151
00:23:50,922 --> 00:23:53,254
- What's your name?
- Paul.

152
00:23:53,358 --> 00:23:56,589
Does any of your family know
about the oil that you say is there?

153
00:23:56,695 --> 00:23:58,128
I don't know.

154
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,824
My uncle always said
there was oil there,

155
00:24:00,966 --> 00:24:03,434
but I don't know what they heard
or what they think.

156
00:24:03,535 --> 00:24:04,968
What do you grow?

157
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:10,235
lt's goats. It's a goat farm.
I told you, nothing grows but weeds.

158
00:24:10,342 --> 00:24:12,833
- Is there water?
- It's salty.

159
00:24:12,978 --> 00:24:16,345
You drill a well,
it's hard not to get saltwater.

160
00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:21,617
The oil is there. I'm telling you.

161
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:29,455
- I want to go now, so...
- You can stay tonight.

162
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:33,655
- No, I want to go now. I want to leave.
- Listen, Paul.

163
00:24:35,534 --> 00:24:40,301
If I travel all the way out there
and I find that you've been lying to me,

164
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:43,032
I'm going to find you and I'm going
to take more than my money back.

165
00:24:43,141 --> 00:24:45,371
Is that all right with you?

166
00:24:45,477 --> 00:24:47,707
- Yes, sir.
- All right, then.

167
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:52,576
- Nice luck to you. God bless.
- And to you, young man.

168
00:26:32,017 --> 00:26:34,008
- There's someone coming.
- Thank you, Mary.

169
00:26:43,762 --> 00:26:47,289
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

170
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:53,099
My name's Daniel Plainview.
This is my son, H.W.

171
00:26:53,972 --> 00:26:56,736
- Are you hunting?
- Hunting for quail.

172
00:26:56,841 --> 00:26:59,708
We're told there might be a good place
to camp up near the Sunday ranch.

173
00:26:59,811 --> 00:27:01,642
This is the Sunday ranch.
You can camp here.

174
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,476
- Thank you. Do you have water?
- Yes.

175
00:27:05,483 --> 00:27:07,474
We heard there was an earthquake
up here a few days ago.

176
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:09,450
- Is that right?
- Yes.

177
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:13,984
- Your family?
- Yeah, all fine. Thank you.

178
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:19,063
- We have goat's milk, if you'd like.
- That would be fine.

179
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,066
Now,

180
00:27:23,968 --> 00:27:28,029
if we set our tent away over there,
we'd be out of your way over there.

181
00:27:28,139 --> 00:27:29,401
That's fine.

182
00:27:29,507 --> 00:27:31,702
Ruth! Help these men
and bring them some water.

183
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,243
No! H.W.

184
00:27:35,146 --> 00:27:38,604
Mr. Plainview,
would you like that milk now?

185
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:42,811
- That would be fine. Thank you.
- Mary! Bring them some milk.

186
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:44,387
My family will help you set up your tent.

187
00:27:44,489 --> 00:27:46,719
No, please.
We set ourselves on this camping trip.

188
00:27:46,825 --> 00:27:48,486
We have to do the camping.

189
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:49,991
Hurry up!

190
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:56,957
- Do you have bread?
- We have potatoes.

191
00:27:57,102 --> 00:27:58,729
Potatoes would be nice, thank you.

192
00:27:58,837 --> 00:28:00,304
I'll have them boil you up
some potatoes.

193
00:28:00,438 --> 00:28:02,736
That's all right.
I thought maybe we'd make a fire.

194
00:28:02,841 --> 00:28:05,071
I wanted to work with my son
on making a fire.

195
00:28:05,176 --> 00:28:07,110
All right. My son, Eli, will bring you
some wood.

196
00:28:07,245 --> 00:28:09,270
Thank you so much for your hospitality,
Mr. Sunday.

197
00:28:09,414 --> 00:28:11,439
- Yes.
- And we'll be out of your way.

198
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:14,279
- We're just hunting for quail.
- Yes.

199
00:28:16,254 --> 00:28:18,415
- I'm sorry we don't have any bread.
- No, no, no.

200
00:28:18,523 --> 00:28:21,321
Corn doesn't fill out in the hills here.
It's mostly rock.

201
00:28:21,459 --> 00:28:24,257
We don't have room to raise the grain.

202
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:30,058
Thank you, young lady.

203
00:28:55,293 --> 00:28:56,920
My name is Eli.

204
00:28:58,263 --> 00:29:00,231
Yes, you're Eli Sunday.

205
00:29:01,232 --> 00:29:02,631
Welcome.

206
00:29:06,337 --> 00:29:08,032
- H.W.
- Eli.

207
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:16,438
- You're hunting quail?
- That's right.

208
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:25,212
- We will bring dinner.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

209
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:48,499
Dad!

210
00:30:49,207 --> 00:30:50,936
Dad, look at my shoe.

211
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:20,063
That's earthquake oil. Set loose.

212
00:31:43,594 --> 00:31:44,891
<i>So...

213
00:31:46,497 --> 00:31:47,691
<i>So?

214
00:31:48,566 --> 00:31:49,931
<i>So, so.

215
00:31:50,735 --> 00:31:54,034
<i>If there's anything here,
we take it to the sea.

216
00:31:55,173 --> 00:31:58,904
What we do is we build a pipeline
to Port Hueneme or Santa Paula,

217
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,534
it's about 100 miles,

218
00:32:00,645 --> 00:32:04,547
and we do a deal with Union Oil.
This is what we do.

219
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:08,052
Then we don't need the railroads
and their shipping costs anymore.

220
00:32:08,152 --> 00:32:09,551
You see?

221
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,414
Yeah.

222
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:16,160
- You see that?
- Yeah.

223
00:32:17,295 --> 00:32:19,525
Then we're making money.
We're making the real money.

224
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,461
What we should be making.
Not just...

225
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:23,965
Not just throwing it away
on shipping costs.

226
00:32:24,102 --> 00:32:26,229
Otherwise, it's just mud.

227
00:32:30,475 --> 00:32:33,035
How much are we going to pay them?

228
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:35,401
Who's that?

229
00:32:38,116 --> 00:32:39,913
The Sunday family.

230
00:32:40,485 --> 00:32:43,352
I'm not going to give them oil prices.

231
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:48,187
I'll give them quail prices.

232
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:55,558
If we could take a few minutes,

233
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:58,794
there's something I'd very much
like to talk with you about.

234
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:02,269
Mother, would you take the girls
outside, please?

235
00:33:14,485 --> 00:33:17,249
I believe in plain speaking, so...

236
00:33:17,388 --> 00:33:21,051
This is a beautiful ranch.
I love hunting for quail.

237
00:33:21,926 --> 00:33:24,986
My boy has been sick, you know.
He needs fresh air.

238
00:33:25,096 --> 00:33:28,327
Doctors all say
he needs plentiful fresh air.

239
00:33:30,168 --> 00:33:31,135
So,

240
00:33:33,738 --> 00:33:37,697
what would you say would be
a fair price for this lot, Abel?

241
00:33:38,843 --> 00:33:41,403
- To buy this place?
- That's right.

242
00:33:46,417 --> 00:33:48,214
Take a moment.

243
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:55,821
- I'm sorry. I don't know.
- Six dollars an acre.

244
00:33:55,927 --> 00:33:59,363
Six dollars? Thank you, Eli.

245
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:03,194
And then with the improvements
to the ranch over the years at $500...

246
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:05,859
I'd like to offer you $3,700
for this ranch.

247
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:08,563
- That's $3,700.
- No.

248
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:11,805
The Lord has sent this man here, Eli.

249
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:13,399
Yes, I believe He has.

250
00:34:13,544 --> 00:34:17,605
- My offer to you is $3,700.
- What is it that brought you here, sir?

251
00:34:18,816 --> 00:34:20,477
The Good Lord's guidance.

252
00:34:20,585 --> 00:34:21,916
- Now, of course, within that...
- What about our oil?

253
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:23,680
...we're going to develop a lease.

254
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:28,481
- What's that?
- What about our oil?

255
00:34:29,894 --> 00:34:31,327
What about it?

256
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:33,624
We have oil here.
That's worth something.

257
00:34:33,731 --> 00:34:36,165
Do you have someone
who can drill for it?

258
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:38,201
- Do you think there's oil here?
- I know there is.

259
00:34:38,336 --> 00:34:40,361
It's very expensive to drill.

260
00:34:40,505 --> 00:34:42,666
To get it up and out of the ground.
You ever tried that before?

261
00:34:42,773 --> 00:34:44,832
- How much is it?
- Costly.

262
00:34:44,942 --> 00:34:48,002
Well, our oil sits right up
on top of the ground.

263
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:50,775
I believe that's called seepage.

264
00:34:50,915 --> 00:34:52,405
Doesn't necessarily mean
there's anything underneath.

265
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,711
- What would you give us for it?
- I don't know.

266
00:34:54,819 --> 00:34:57,754
- Something you don't know.
- That's right.

267
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:03,026
What would you like, Eli?

268
00:35:04,762 --> 00:35:07,060
Ten thousand dollars.

269
00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:10,734
For what?

270
00:35:12,703 --> 00:35:14,398
For my church.

271
00:35:24,348 --> 00:35:25,838
That's good.

272
00:35:28,853 --> 00:35:30,650
That's a good one.

273
00:35:32,323 --> 00:35:33,290
Well...

274
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,154
If we decide to drill for oil
and if the well begins to produce,

275
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,957
I'll give your church
a $5,000 signing bonus.

276
00:35:40,064 --> 00:35:41,031
Ten thousand.

277
00:35:41,132 --> 00:35:43,623
Do you want to find someone else
that's going to come here and drill, Eli?

278
00:35:43,734 --> 00:35:46,828
Make the investment and do
all the hard work that goes into it?

279
00:35:46,971 --> 00:35:50,839
I can just as easily hunt for quail
on another ranch as I can here, so...

280
00:35:50,975 --> 00:35:55,605
Though I'll happily be a supporter
of your church for as long as I can.

281
00:35:55,713 --> 00:35:57,510
For the bonus only.

282
00:35:59,317 --> 00:36:03,117
Now, as it happens, I do have some
connections in the drilling business

283
00:36:03,221 --> 00:36:07,783
who might help get us started.
How do you feel about this, Abel?

284
00:36:07,892 --> 00:36:09,792
Yes. What Eli says.

285
00:36:09,927 --> 00:36:13,090
Well, good! Let's draw up
some contracts and let's...

286
00:36:13,197 --> 00:36:15,097
Let's give it a try.

287
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:19,300
Appreciate your help with this, Eli.

288
00:36:30,615 --> 00:36:32,242
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

289
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,647
- Real estate?
- Yes.

290
00:36:33,784 --> 00:36:35,775
Yes, I'd like to talk to you.

291
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,414
I'm looking for some land.
I just bought the Sunday ranch.

292
00:36:40,558 --> 00:36:44,585
And, well, where's the map?

293
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:47,596
Where are the hills
behind the Sunday ranch?

294
00:36:47,732 --> 00:36:51,395
That's here. It's the Bandy tract.
He has over 600 acres.

295
00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:55,563
Bandy, 600.

296
00:36:55,706 --> 00:37:02,168
- What about this?
- A.C. Maude, Blodget, Redlick, Carr.

297
00:37:03,881 --> 00:37:06,873
- What's it held at?
- Six dollars an acre.

298
00:37:07,618 --> 00:37:08,915
Six.

299
00:37:09,053 --> 00:37:10,680
What about this?

300
00:37:10,788 --> 00:37:14,383
That's the Belvins,
and that could be got, I'm sure.

301
00:37:16,294 --> 00:37:18,990
Can everything around here be got?

302
00:37:19,764 --> 00:37:21,231
Sure.

303
00:37:45,556 --> 00:37:49,014
Paul Sunday turned out
to be a good friend of ours.

304
00:37:49,727 --> 00:37:51,319
That's right.

305
00:37:53,664 --> 00:37:57,657
Well, you get here just as soon
as you can. Bring Fred English.

306
00:37:59,036 --> 00:38:00,469
Good enough.

307
00:38:01,138 --> 00:38:02,867
Thank you, porter.

308
00:38:05,476 --> 00:38:08,104
- H.W., how are you?
- Fine, and you?

309
00:38:08,212 --> 00:38:10,112
- Pretty good. Where's your dad?
- He's inside.

310
00:38:10,214 --> 00:38:11,613
You fellas are a long way
from Signal Hill.

311
00:38:11,716 --> 00:38:13,684
- Hello, Plainview.
- Hello, Gene.

312
00:38:13,818 --> 00:38:16,309
- Good to see you.
- Charlie.

313
00:38:16,454 --> 00:38:20,982
- On your way somewhere else?
- Passing through. Looking around.

314
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:23,616
- Funny to see you.
- Funny, isn't it?

315
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:26,491
You boys are a regular family business.

316
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,291
You boys are a little late.

317
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:32,459
- What did you find?
- I found some interesting prospects.

318
00:38:32,603 --> 00:38:33,831
Did you hear Standard bought up?

319
00:38:33,971 --> 00:38:36,565
- Mostly in the north, so far.
- That's what I hear.

320
00:38:36,674 --> 00:38:40,110
I'm gonna tell you, Gene,
if you're gonna make a play, look east.

321
00:38:40,244 --> 00:38:45,477
I'd rather it be you than someone else.
This mud around here has been taken.

322
00:38:45,616 --> 00:38:49,143
It must be easy when you have such
a cute face to carry around with you.

323
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:52,346
- Telling me how handsome my son is?
- Well, that I am.

324
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:55,619
That's very nice. Thank you.
Good luck, Gene.

325
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,228
- Take care.
- Like I said, go east.

326
00:38:58,329 --> 00:38:59,421
H.W.

327
00:39:00,464 --> 00:39:03,126
I'll be your lawyer
if you need to draw up a contract.

328
00:39:03,267 --> 00:39:07,533
Make sure you don't get swindled, boy.
Get half what your dad's making.

329
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:19,407
How's that?

330
00:39:34,365 --> 00:39:36,526
What are those men doing?

331
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:41,394
They're just guys
that are working for us.

332
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:43,837
They're just looking around.

333
00:39:46,043 --> 00:39:48,273
How much money can we make?

334
00:39:52,316 --> 00:39:54,682
I don't know. It depends.

335
00:39:58,889 --> 00:40:00,982
One thousand dollars?

336
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:12,599
Mary said that her father beats her
if she doesn't pray.

337
00:40:19,176 --> 00:40:21,610
Mary, she's the smaller one?

338
00:40:24,281 --> 00:40:25,805
Yes, she is.

339
00:40:39,597 --> 00:40:42,122
- Everyone here?
- Very successful.

340
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,924
But?

341
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:47,435
There were a few vacant lots
and one holdout.

342
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:49,198
- Who?
- William Bandy.

343
00:40:49,306 --> 00:40:51,365
...eight. Who's he?

344
00:40:51,475 --> 00:40:52,874
He's an old man
who homesteaded here.

345
00:40:52,977 --> 00:40:56,105
Lives with his grandson.
He said he'd like to speak with you.

346
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:57,407
Is he here?

347
00:40:57,548 --> 00:41:00,574
No, he'd like you to come visit with him.

348
00:41:00,718 --> 00:41:02,413
He's boosting his price.

349
00:41:02,553 --> 00:41:06,353
He said he'd like to speak
with whoever is doing the buying.

350
00:41:06,457 --> 00:41:09,722
Well, let him wait. He'll come around.
Let's go.

351
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,734
Ladies and gentlemen?

352
00:41:19,737 --> 00:41:21,762
Ladies and gentlemen.

353
00:41:21,906 --> 00:41:25,273
Thank you so much
for visiting with us this evening.

354
00:41:25,409 --> 00:41:28,970
Now, I've traveled across half our state
to be here and to see about this land.

355
00:41:32,049 --> 00:41:33,539
<i>Now, I daresay some of you
might have heard

356
00:41:33,684 --> 00:41:37,518
<i>some of the more extravagant rumors
about what my plans are,

357
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:40,385
<i>so I just thought
you'd like to hear it from me.

358
00:41:40,524 --> 00:41:43,391
<i>This is the face. It's no great mystery.

359
00:41:46,263 --> 00:41:50,222
<i>I'm an oilman, ladies and gentlemen,

360
00:41:51,101 --> 00:41:54,502
<i>I have numerous concerns
spread across this state.

361
00:41:54,605 --> 00:41:58,006
<i>I have many wells flowing
at many thousand barrels per day,

362
00:41:58,108 --> 00:42:01,077
<i>so I like to think of myself as an oilman.

363
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,876
<i>As an oilman, I hope that you'll forgive

364
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:06,882
<i>just good old-fashioned plain speaking.

365
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:12,046
<i>Now, this work that we do
is very much a family enterprise.

366
00:42:12,189 --> 00:42:14,851
<i>I work side by side
with my wonderful son, H. W.

367
00:42:14,959 --> 00:42:18,190
<i>I think one or two of you
might have met him already.

368
00:42:18,295 --> 00:42:22,061
<i>And I encourage my men
to bring their families, as well.

369
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:26,158
<i>Of course, it makes for an ever
so much more rewarding life for them.

370
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:30,229
<i>Family means children,
and children means education.

371
00:42:30,374 --> 00:42:34,037
<i>So, wherever we set up camp,
education is a necessity,

372
00:42:34,178 --> 00:42:36,373
<i>and we're just so happy
to take care of that.

373
00:42:36,513 --> 00:42:38,879
So let's build a wonderful school
in Little Boston.

374
00:42:39,016 --> 00:42:41,211
These children are the future
that we strive for,

375
00:42:41,352 --> 00:42:44,446
and so they should have
the very best of things.

376
00:42:44,555 --> 00:42:46,546
Now, something else,

377
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:50,524
and please don't be insulted
if I speak about this. Bread.

378
00:42:50,661 --> 00:42:52,629
Let's talk about bread.

379
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:56,663
Now, to my mind, it's an abomination
to consider

380
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,998
that any man, woman, or child
in this magnificent country of ours

381
00:43:01,138 --> 00:43:04,596
should have to look upon
a loaf of bread as a luxury.

382
00:43:05,409 --> 00:43:08,970
<i>We're going to dig water wells here,
and water wells means irrigation.

383
00:43:09,113 --> 00:43:11,479
<i>Irrigation means cultivation.

384
00:43:11,615 --> 00:43:15,483
<i>We're going to raise crops here where
before it just simply wasn't possible.

385
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:18,019
<i>You're going to have more grain
than you'll know what to do with,

386
00:43:18,155 --> 00:43:21,090
<i>and bread will be coming right
out of your ears, ma'am.

387
00:43:21,191 --> 00:43:26,493
<i>New roads, agriculture,
employment, education.

388
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:28,598
These are just a few of the things
we can offer you,

389
00:43:28,699 --> 00:43:30,667
and I assure you,
ladies and gentlemen,

390
00:43:30,801 --> 00:43:32,962
that if we do find oil here,

391
00:43:33,103 --> 00:43:36,504
and I think there's a very good chance
that we will,

392
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,134
this community of yours
will not only survive, it will flourish.

393
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,406
I'd be happy to answer any questions
that you might have. Yes?

394
00:43:46,517 --> 00:43:49,042
Will the new road lead to the church?

395
00:43:49,153 --> 00:43:53,590
That'll be the first place that it leads.
Thank you, Eli. Anyone else?

396
00:43:54,258 --> 00:43:56,556
Well, if anything comes up,
I'm pretty easy to find.

397
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:57,922
You just come visit with me.

398
00:43:58,028 --> 00:44:00,053
Thank you so much for your time,
and good night.

399
00:44:38,602 --> 00:44:43,562
<i>What a privilege to carry

400
00:44:43,707 --> 00:44:47,575
<i>everything to God in prayer!

401
00:44:48,545 --> 00:44:52,106
<i>What a privilege to carry...

402
00:45:09,466 --> 00:45:11,331
Just follow the new road
right to the church.

403
00:45:11,435 --> 00:45:13,665
The new road will lead you there.

404
00:45:13,771 --> 00:45:15,432
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.

405
00:45:15,572 --> 00:45:19,099
The Church of the Third Revelation
welcomes you.

406
00:45:19,243 --> 00:45:20,938
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.

407
00:45:21,078 --> 00:45:23,376
The Church of the Third Revelation
welcomes you.

408
00:45:23,514 --> 00:45:26,540
Just follow the new road
right to the church.

409
00:45:35,392 --> 00:45:38,953
<i>Jesus knows our every weakness

410
00:45:40,798 --> 00:45:43,733
<i>Take it to the Lord in prayer

411
00:45:44,968 --> 00:45:49,132
<i>Are we weak and heavy-laden

412
00:45:50,174 --> 00:45:53,166
<i>Cumbered with a load of care?

413
00:45:54,411 --> 00:45:57,505
<i>Precious Savior still our refuge

414
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:02,144
<i>Take it to the Lord in prayer...

415
00:46:14,164 --> 00:46:17,224
- Daniel, may I speak with you?
- Yes, come in.

416
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:22,338
I'll bring them up when they arrive.

417
00:46:22,472 --> 00:46:24,667
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

418
00:46:24,808 --> 00:46:26,708
How is all the work coming?

419
00:46:26,844 --> 00:46:28,277
Everything's good.

420
00:46:28,378 --> 00:46:31,506
- All the men are provided for?
- Of course.

421
00:46:33,584 --> 00:46:35,449
Spirits seem high.

422
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:41,357
Is there anything
that you need from me?

423
00:46:44,461 --> 00:46:48,693
- Anything the church can do for you?
- I don't believe so. No. Thank you.

424
00:46:48,832 --> 00:46:51,164
I understand you've asked the people
to gather around

425
00:46:51,301 --> 00:46:52,893
and watch the well begin tomorrow.
Is that right?

426
00:46:53,003 --> 00:46:54,971
- That's right.
- I will bless the well.

427
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,436
Before you begin,
you should introduce me.

428
00:46:59,543 --> 00:47:02,103
You'll see me walk up
towards the oil well, and when I...

429
00:47:02,212 --> 00:47:03,270
The derrick.

430
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,180
You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say my name.

431
00:47:07,317 --> 00:47:09,444
When you walk up?

432
00:47:09,553 --> 00:47:13,455
Yes. You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say,

433
00:47:13,557 --> 00:47:18,688
"The proud son of these hills
who tended his Father's flock,"

434
00:47:18,929 --> 00:47:21,329
and then you could say my name.

435
00:47:22,633 --> 00:47:24,191
That's fine.

436
00:47:25,202 --> 00:47:28,603
- And what happens then?
- Well, then we start the drill.

437
00:47:31,775 --> 00:47:35,404
It's a simple blessing, Daniel,
but an important one.

438
00:47:35,545 --> 00:47:38,514
It's just a few words. It won't take long.

439
00:47:39,616 --> 00:47:42,710
- What time?
- What time's good for you, Eli?

440
00:47:42,853 --> 00:47:45,651
- 4:00.
- Well, let's make it 4:00 then.

441
00:47:46,757 --> 00:47:50,488
- My thanks for your visit.
- Good day. Thank you.

442
00:48:05,909 --> 00:48:07,877
Afternoon, everyone.

443
00:48:09,212 --> 00:48:10,804
Come with me.

444
00:48:16,219 --> 00:48:19,677
I thank you all so much
for visiting with us at this time.

445
00:48:19,823 --> 00:48:21,620
I've had the pleasure of
meeting some of you

446
00:48:21,725 --> 00:48:23,556
and I hope very much
in the months to come,

447
00:48:23,694 --> 00:48:26,857
I'll be able to visit with
each and every one of you.

448
00:48:26,997 --> 00:48:29,659
I'm better at digging holes in the
ground than making speeches,

449
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,324
so let's forget the speech
for this evening,

450
00:48:31,468 --> 00:48:33,368
just make it a simple blessing.

451
00:48:33,503 --> 00:48:35,266
You see, one man doesn't prospect
from the ground.

452
00:48:35,372 --> 00:48:39,308
It takes a whole community of
good people, such as yourselves,

453
00:48:39,409 --> 00:48:42,401
and this is good. We stay together.

454
00:48:42,512 --> 00:48:44,275
We pray together, we work together,

455
00:48:44,381 --> 00:48:47,350
and if the Good Lord smiles kindly
on our endeavor,

456
00:48:47,484 --> 00:48:49,952
we share in the wealth together.

457
00:48:52,389 --> 00:48:54,448
Now, before we spud in
Mary's Well Number One,

458
00:48:54,558 --> 00:48:57,721
named for the lovely
Miss Mary Sunday, here by my side,

459
00:48:57,828 --> 00:49:00,820
a proud daughter of these hills,

460
00:49:00,964 --> 00:49:04,661
I'd just like to say God bless these
honest labors of ours, and, of course,

461
00:49:04,801 --> 00:49:06,826
God bless you all.

462
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:08,062
Amen.

463
00:49:08,171 --> 00:49:09,468
Now go.

464
00:49:14,444 --> 00:49:16,207
Won't be a minute.

465
00:49:19,282 --> 00:49:21,250
Fast as you can, H.W.

466
00:49:24,755 --> 00:49:26,882
Are you ready to do this?

467
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:39,201
That's it, ladies and gentlemen!

468
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:47,202
Al Rose has very generously provided
some refreshments for this occasion

469
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:50,040
out of his own pocket. Thank you, Al.

470
00:49:50,781 --> 00:49:55,218
If you'll all just care to help yourselves,
I'll be back in a minute.

471
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:09,715
Mary.

472
00:51:11,394 --> 00:51:13,021
Mary Sunday.

473
00:51:15,866 --> 00:51:18,596
- Do you like your new dress?
- Yes. Thank you.

474
00:51:18,702 --> 00:51:21,603
You're welcome. I thought you'd like it.

475
00:51:22,472 --> 00:51:24,997
- Are you happy I came here?
- Yes.

476
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:30,407
Your daddy doesn't hit you anymore,
does he? Does he now?

477
00:51:31,281 --> 00:51:33,146
Better not, right?

478
00:51:33,817 --> 00:51:35,808
I'll take care of you.

479
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:42,051
No more hitting, right?
No more hitting. Now go.

480
00:51:42,192 --> 00:51:45,218
Go and play some more
and don't come back.

481
00:51:54,371 --> 00:51:55,804
Daniel?

482
00:51:59,476 --> 00:52:03,640
lt's okay, H.W. Go back to sleep.
Go on. Go back to sleep.

483
00:52:06,183 --> 00:52:07,343
Daniel.

484
00:52:09,753 --> 00:52:10,947
Daniel.

485
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:15,152
Daniel!

486
00:52:16,726 --> 00:52:17,920
Daniel!

487
00:52:18,028 --> 00:52:19,290
What?

488
00:52:21,164 --> 00:52:23,257
Lost a man down the well.

489
00:52:27,804 --> 00:52:29,931
- What man?
- Joe Gundha.

490
00:52:31,942 --> 00:52:34,001
- Did I know him?
- No.

491
00:52:34,511 --> 00:52:35,569
What happened?

492
00:52:43,253 --> 00:52:44,652
Pick it up.

493
00:52:45,322 --> 00:52:46,914
Set the brake.

494
00:52:47,023 --> 00:52:49,321
- Tie it down.
- Tie it on.

495
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:55,261
Shit!

496
00:52:57,334 --> 00:53:00,132
God damn it. Where's the body?

497
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:03,462
- They're fishing it out now.
- All right.

498
00:53:06,843 --> 00:53:09,471
- Where's the bit?
- It's on the deck.

499
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,856
Clean him up. Put some clothes on him.

500
00:53:56,993 --> 00:53:58,255
And...

501
00:53:59,896 --> 00:54:01,454
Set up a tent.

502
00:54:01,564 --> 00:54:05,523
Anyone goes down into the cellar,
you tell somebody. Yes?

503
00:54:06,169 --> 00:54:07,568
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

504
00:54:11,508 --> 00:54:13,533
Shut down till midday.

505
00:54:44,841 --> 00:54:50,245
And I had a vision.
Yes, last night, I had a vision

506
00:54:50,347 --> 00:54:53,248
and I felt God's breath
move through me.

507
00:54:56,886 --> 00:55:00,982
And it rolled down into my stomach.

508
00:55:02,992 --> 00:55:04,857
It sloshed around.

509
00:55:06,262 --> 00:55:10,130
And my stomach spoke in a whisper,
not a shout,

510
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:17,568
"Touch this woman with your hands
and caress her." Yes.

511
00:55:21,945 --> 00:55:24,106
My dear Mrs. Hunter,

512
00:55:25,281 --> 00:55:27,613
you have arthritis, don't you?

513
00:55:27,751 --> 00:55:29,742
- Yes, I do, Eli.
- Yes.

514
00:55:29,853 --> 00:55:33,448
The devil is in your hands,
and I will suck it out.

515
00:55:34,624 --> 00:55:39,084
Now, I will not cast this ghost out
with a fever

516
00:55:39,229 --> 00:55:44,257
for the new spirit inside me has shown
me I have a new way to communicate.

517
00:55:46,736 --> 00:55:48,761
It is a gentle whisper.

518
00:55:55,145 --> 00:55:57,511
Get out of here, ghost.

519
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:02,415
Get out of here, ghost.

520
00:56:04,454 --> 00:56:05,887
Get out.

521
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:09,390
Get out of here, ghost.

522
00:56:11,761 --> 00:56:14,924
Get out of here, ghost.

523
00:56:15,064 --> 00:56:18,966
...and enter this woman's body now.
- Get out of here, ghost.

524
00:56:19,068 --> 00:56:23,903
Get out of here. Don't you dare turn
around and come back.

525
00:56:25,108 --> 00:56:26,803
For if you do,

526
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:32,405
all the armies of my boot
will kick you in the teeth

527
00:56:32,549 --> 00:56:36,041
and you will be cast up
and thrown in the dirt

528
00:56:36,186 --> 00:56:38,552
and thrust back to perdition!

529
00:56:38,688 --> 00:56:42,385
And as long as I have teeth,
I will bite you,

530
00:56:42,525 --> 00:56:46,484
and if I have no teeth, I will gum you!

531
00:56:46,596 --> 00:56:50,327
And as long as I have fists,
I will bash you!

532
00:56:50,433 --> 00:56:55,166
Now, get out of here, ghost!
Get out of here, ghost!

533
00:56:55,305 --> 00:56:58,331
Get out of here, ghost!

534
00:57:01,511 --> 00:57:03,103
And it left!

535
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,871
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

536
00:57:07,417 --> 00:57:09,851
- Praise the Lord and his holy days!
- Praise God!

537
00:57:09,986 --> 00:57:13,422
- Amen! Thank you.
- Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, God.

538
00:57:14,691 --> 00:57:16,852
My dear Mrs. Hunter.

539
00:57:20,463 --> 00:57:22,192
Dance with me.

540
00:57:29,439 --> 00:57:31,771
- Thanks for coming.
- It was a wonderful sermon.

541
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:34,275
- Will I see you tomorrow?
- Yes.

542
00:57:39,282 --> 00:57:40,249
Eli.

543
00:57:42,819 --> 00:57:45,617
Had a tragedy at the well last night.

544
00:57:46,856 --> 00:57:48,551
Yes, I heard.

545
00:57:48,658 --> 00:57:51,058
Joe Gundha was a man
of considerable faith.

546
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:55,392
So if you wish to say a few words,
his burial is at noon tomorrow.

547
00:57:55,498 --> 00:57:58,331
Daniel, this accident
could have been avoided.

548
00:57:58,468 --> 00:58:00,561
It is terrible to think of that well

549
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:02,535
- working away out there...
- These men work in 12-hour shifts.

550
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:03,628
...unblessed.
- They need their rest.

551
00:58:03,773 --> 00:58:05,502
If they don't have it,
they start to make stupid mistakes.

552
00:58:05,608 --> 00:58:08,372
I've seen the men drinking. Don't you
think that has something to do with this?

553
00:58:08,478 --> 00:58:09,945
We need these men well-rested
to bring in this well.

554
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,240
They can't get that if they're up here
listening to your gospel,

555
00:58:12,348 --> 00:58:14,475
and then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.

556
00:58:14,617 --> 00:58:16,585
I wish I had more time with Joe Gundha.

557
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:17,913
More could have been done.

558
00:58:18,054 --> 00:58:23,048
Then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.

559
00:58:29,399 --> 00:58:31,697
Now, would you see to it
that his personal possessions

560
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:33,928
find their way
back to his family, please?

561
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:35,537
Thank you.

562
00:58:36,072 --> 00:58:39,200
Heard you were planning
some renovations.

563
00:58:39,309 --> 00:58:42,278
Yes, our congregation
is growing strongly.

564
00:58:42,946 --> 00:58:47,406
- We need more room.
- That was one goddamn hell of a show.

565
00:58:48,551 --> 00:58:51,076
We were happy to have you, Daniel.

566
01:00:44,701 --> 01:00:46,430
Gas, gas, gas!

567
01:00:55,511 --> 01:00:58,605
Lights out! Wait here. Wait here.
Lights out!

568
01:01:08,758 --> 01:01:10,555
Put that fire out!

569
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:41,186
Is he hurt? H.W.!
Hand him down to me!

570
01:01:45,762 --> 01:01:47,992
- Hand him down!
- Here.

571
01:01:52,135 --> 01:01:54,228
- Got him?
- I've got him!

572
01:02:01,544 --> 01:02:02,909
Oh, God.

573
01:02:18,327 --> 01:02:19,726
Come on.

574
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:33,432
Open the door.

575
01:02:48,257 --> 01:02:50,987
Let go. There you go. You're safe.
You're safe.

576
01:02:51,961 --> 01:02:55,795
You're safe now. I got you here.
You're safe. Let go, son.

577
01:02:57,166 --> 01:03:00,033
Tell me where it hurts.
Tell me where it hurts. Tell me where...

578
01:03:00,169 --> 01:03:01,636
- Did you see this?
- No.

579
01:03:01,737 --> 01:03:02,795
Tell me where it hurts.

580
01:03:02,905 --> 01:03:05,465
Where does it hurt you?
Where does it hurt you?

581
01:03:05,575 --> 01:03:09,238
- I can't hear my voice.
- Were you hit in the head?

582
01:03:09,946 --> 01:03:14,474
Were you hit in the head? Tell me!
You have to tell me if you were!

583
01:03:14,584 --> 01:03:16,609
I can't hear my voice.

584
01:03:25,595 --> 01:03:28,325
I have to go and deal with this now.
You wait here for me.

585
01:03:28,431 --> 01:03:32,265
You understand? You wait here for me.
I'll be back. I'll be back in a minute.

586
01:03:32,368 --> 01:03:33,528
- Wait here.
- Don't leave!

587
01:03:33,669 --> 01:03:38,106
I'm going to take care of you. Wait.
Stay here, son. I'm going to fix this.

588
01:03:38,207 --> 01:03:39,105
- Don't leave!
- You're going to be fine!

589
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:40,197
Wait for me here!

590
01:03:40,309 --> 01:03:43,301
- Hold him down. Hold him down.
- Don't leave!

591
01:03:45,548 --> 01:03:48,176
Got to break the cables, Daniel!

592
01:03:48,317 --> 01:03:50,182
Get me a hammer!

593
01:03:56,492 --> 01:03:58,323
Get me a hammer!

594
01:04:00,897 --> 01:04:02,592
Here you go.

595
01:04:27,924 --> 01:04:29,255
Get back!

596
01:05:06,896 --> 01:05:08,193
- Michael!
- Sir!

597
01:05:08,297 --> 01:05:10,731
Take Dave and two of the fellas,
pick up some hoses...

598
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:14,769
Billy, protect the roof.
Don't wait before it gets too hot.

599
01:05:37,159 --> 01:05:39,787
What are you looking
so miserable about?

600
01:05:39,929 --> 01:05:42,762
There's a whole ocean of oil
under our feet!

601
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:45,560
No one can get at it except for me.

602
01:06:32,281 --> 01:06:33,873
H.W. okay?

603
01:06:34,884 --> 01:06:36,442
No, he isn't.

604
01:06:38,721 --> 01:06:41,053
- Where is he?
- Mess room.

605
01:08:20,256 --> 01:08:23,885
That's enough now.
That's enough, H.W. That's enough.

606
01:08:26,562 --> 01:08:29,588
Do you hear me?
Can you hear me in there?

607
01:08:35,371 --> 01:08:37,066
That's enough.

608
01:08:49,418 --> 01:08:52,182
- Grab his legs.
- I have his legs.

609
01:08:52,288 --> 01:08:54,188
- No. Nope.
- No, lad.

610
01:08:59,862 --> 01:09:01,523
Give me that.

611
01:09:05,768 --> 01:09:06,826
Steady. That's it.

612
01:09:06,936 --> 01:09:09,336
- Easy, boy. Easy.
- Soon be over.

613
01:09:09,438 --> 01:09:13,204
Yeah, and that's good.
Now the other side. Turn him over.

614
01:09:17,146 --> 01:09:18,113
Almost done.

615
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:23,117
That's it.

616
01:09:23,986 --> 01:09:26,784
Come here. It's over. It's over.

617
01:11:33,082 --> 01:11:35,710
Who do we know in San Francisco

618
01:11:37,286 --> 01:11:40,050
or Los Angeles, who could work with...

619
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:46,322
You know, we could...
Someone, a teacher for H.W.

620
01:11:50,666 --> 01:11:52,998
How could you figure out that?

621
01:11:53,869 --> 01:11:57,862
Now, call...
God damn it, what's his name?

622
01:11:58,007 --> 01:12:00,305
Bob Brody in San Francisco?

623
01:12:01,477 --> 01:12:04,537
Call Bob Brody
and get someone down here.

624
01:12:11,153 --> 01:12:13,053
I'll do it right away.

625
01:13:20,689 --> 01:13:22,953
When do we get our money, Daniel?

626
01:13:28,998 --> 01:13:32,525
Aren't you a healer?
And a vessel for the Holy Spirit?

627
01:13:32,668 --> 01:13:35,660
When are you coming over
and make my son hear again?

628
01:13:35,805 --> 01:13:36,931
Can't you do that?

629
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:39,007
lf you had let me bless the well,
this wouldn't have happened.

630
01:13:39,141 --> 01:13:41,939
- Daniel.
- You shouldn't have done that.

631
01:13:43,312 --> 01:13:47,612
You owe the Church of
the Third Revelation $5,000

632
01:13:47,716 --> 01:13:50,583
as part of the arrangement
that we made!

633
01:14:00,362 --> 01:14:05,163
Don't even try it, you little runt!
You splash around in here.

634
01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:13,941
That's it, that's it.

635
01:14:26,021 --> 01:14:28,683
I'm going to bury you underground, Eli.

636
01:14:32,728 --> 01:14:35,322
I'm going to bury you underground.

637
01:15:06,896 --> 01:15:09,660
You are a stupid man, Abel.

638
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:16,130
You've let someone come in here
and walk all over us.

639
01:15:18,307 --> 01:15:22,767
You let him in and do his work here,

640
01:15:22,878 --> 01:15:26,871
and you are a stupid man
for what we could have had.

641
01:15:27,016 --> 01:15:30,952
I followed His word, Eli. I tried.

642
01:15:31,053 --> 01:15:33,783
You didn't do anything but sit down.

643
01:15:35,157 --> 01:15:37,625
You're lazy, and you're stupid.

644
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:45,460
Do you think God is going
to save you for being stupid?

645
01:15:48,137 --> 01:15:50,697
He doesn't save stupid people, Abel.

646
01:15:54,076 --> 01:15:58,513
I will tear you apart for
what you've done, you stupid man!

647
01:15:58,647 --> 01:16:00,945
How did he come here?
Do you really know? I know!

648
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:03,678
- Son, don't do this, please!
- Be quiet!

649
01:16:03,819 --> 01:16:08,847
Shut your mouth, Abel!
lt was your stupid son!

650
01:16:08,991 --> 01:16:12,927
lt was Paul who told him to come here.
I know it.

651
01:16:13,028 --> 01:16:14,757
He went to him and he said,

652
01:16:14,863 --> 01:16:19,596
"My stupid, weak father
will give away his lots.

653
01:16:19,702 --> 01:16:23,160
"Go and take him."
And you let it happen.

654
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:30,838
A stupid father to a stupid son.

655
01:16:36,485 --> 01:16:38,146
Get out of there!

656
01:17:08,851 --> 01:17:10,478
Can I help you?

657
01:17:12,054 --> 01:17:13,578
Daniel?

658
01:17:13,689 --> 01:17:17,420
- Who's that?
- My name is Henry.

659
01:17:18,394 --> 01:17:19,793
Yeah?

660
01:17:20,963 --> 01:17:22,362
I'm Henry.

661
01:17:23,899 --> 01:17:25,924
What can I do for you?

662
01:17:28,804 --> 01:17:32,604
I'm Henry Plainview.
I'm from Fond du Lac.

663
01:17:35,144 --> 01:17:38,978
I'm your brother, from another mother.

664
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:43,150
Ernest is my father.

665
01:17:47,456 --> 01:17:48,980
Who are you?

666
01:17:50,359 --> 01:17:51,587
Henry.

667
01:18:18,654 --> 01:18:23,114
- Mary Branch? Is that your mother?
- Yes, sir, that's right.

668
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:30,525
I read about your gusher in the paper,
about your success.

669
01:18:30,666 --> 01:18:33,692
You heard about my strike?
You just show up?

670
01:18:34,737 --> 01:18:36,500
Our father's dead.

671
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:41,337
Ernest died, I heard.
I wanted to find you.

672
01:18:41,477 --> 01:18:43,104
When?

673
01:18:43,212 --> 01:18:46,807
Three months ago.
I got a letter from Annabelle.

674
01:18:47,816 --> 01:18:49,681
My sister, Annabelle?

675
01:18:51,687 --> 01:18:55,350
- Where is she?
- Still at home. Fond du Lac.

676
01:18:57,092 --> 01:19:00,550
You came all the way
from Wisconsin to tell me this?

677
01:19:00,696 --> 01:19:03,722
I'm coming from New Mexico.
I've been there.

678
01:19:04,933 --> 01:19:06,798
I came to find you.

679
01:19:07,936 --> 01:19:09,995
Did you know about me?

680
01:19:18,113 --> 01:19:20,308
Do you have identification?

681
01:19:20,983 --> 01:19:23,076
Do you have this letter?

682
01:19:46,241 --> 01:19:48,300
- Where are you coming from?
- From New Mexico.

683
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:50,345
Yes, I know, but from where?

684
01:19:50,345 --> 01:19:50,868
Yes, I know, but from where?

685
01:19:51,013 --> 01:19:54,039
Silver City.
I've been there for two years.

686
01:19:55,117 --> 01:19:59,918
I was trying drilling of my own for years.

687
01:20:00,055 --> 01:20:06,460
- Getting leases in Texas. Louisiana.
- Anything that produced?

688
01:20:06,562 --> 01:20:09,554
No. Not like your success, no.

689
01:20:16,071 --> 01:20:18,505
- Are you married?
- No.

690
01:20:19,007 --> 01:20:23,000
I spent time in jail.
I had a stretch of very bad time.

691
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:26,876
I had nothing.
I was picked up in Louisiana.

692
01:20:28,383 --> 01:20:32,012
I worked on a chain gang
for six months building roads.

693
01:20:32,554 --> 01:20:35,717
That was a very hard time.

694
01:20:39,494 --> 01:20:41,291
Are you married?

695
01:20:42,564 --> 01:20:44,998
What were you in jail for?

696
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:49,628
Believe it or not, for all the
terrible things I've gotten myself into,

697
01:20:49,738 --> 01:20:53,265
when they picked me up,
I hadn't done anything.

698
01:20:53,375 --> 01:20:57,175
But I've done my share of things

699
01:20:59,481 --> 01:21:01,881
that shouldn't be talked about.

700
01:21:24,373 --> 01:21:27,433
Drink it. Drink it!

701
01:22:10,018 --> 01:22:11,315
Come on.

702
01:22:42,985 --> 01:22:44,282
So...

703
01:22:49,091 --> 01:22:50,854
What do you want, Henry?

704
01:22:53,295 --> 01:22:54,694
Nothing.

705
01:22:57,833 --> 01:23:01,997
If you can spare something,
I can work for you in any way.

706
01:23:02,137 --> 01:23:06,437
I know I'll keep moving, before long,
to get back to Fond du Lac.

707
01:23:07,476 --> 01:23:09,808
- Do you have any money?
- Some.

708
01:23:10,912 --> 01:23:13,073
- Not much.
- Just answer me directly.

709
01:23:13,181 --> 01:23:16,776
You say "nothing," then you say
you'd like to stay and work.

710
01:23:16,885 --> 01:23:21,822
And it's better, I'd just like to hear
you say you'd like to be here.

711
01:23:22,958 --> 01:23:24,858
I'd like to be here.

712
01:23:30,198 --> 01:23:35,795
I'm a good worker.
I worked cable tool rigs, built railroads.

713
01:23:37,973 --> 01:23:39,998
I won't need any favors.

714
01:23:45,013 --> 01:23:46,139
Good.

715
01:24:12,007 --> 01:24:14,168
<i>What did my mother know?

716
01:24:16,778 --> 01:24:18,439
<i>I don't know.

717
01:24:19,014 --> 01:24:23,542
<i>I don't know if she knew and looked
the other way, if she never knew.

718
01:24:26,288 --> 01:24:28,051
<i>Why did you leave?

719
01:24:29,991 --> 01:24:32,960
<i>I know you didn't get on with our father.

720
01:24:38,166 --> 01:24:41,897
I worked for Geological Survey
and went to Kansas.

721
01:24:44,339 --> 01:24:47,365
I couldn't stay there. I just couldn't.

722
01:24:49,111 --> 01:24:51,636
I don't like to explain myself.

723
01:24:57,686 --> 01:25:01,918
- Are you an angry man, Henry?
- About what?

724
01:25:02,757 --> 01:25:06,523
Are you envious? Do you get envious?

725
01:25:07,829 --> 01:25:09,763
I don't think so, no.

726
01:25:14,236 --> 01:25:16,568
I have a competition in me.

727
01:25:17,806 --> 01:25:20,206
I want no one else to succeed.

728
01:25:25,247 --> 01:25:29,741
- I hate most people.
- That part of me is gone.

729
01:25:30,986 --> 01:25:33,853
Working and not succeeding,

730
01:25:33,955 --> 01:25:37,948
all my failures have left me...

731
01:25:40,996 --> 01:25:42,861
I just don't care.

732
01:25:44,566 --> 01:25:47,160
Well, if it's in me, it's in you.

733
01:25:48,703 --> 01:25:54,107
There are times when I look at people
and I see nothing worth liking.

734
01:26:00,115 --> 01:26:04,142
I want to earn enough money
I can get away from everyone.

735
01:26:09,191 --> 01:26:11,659
What will you do about your boy?

736
01:26:19,401 --> 01:26:21,028
I don't know.

737
01:26:22,571 --> 01:26:25,005
Maybe it'll change.

738
01:26:25,173 --> 01:26:29,576
Does your sound come back to you?
I don't know. Maybe no one knows that.

739
01:26:29,711 --> 01:26:33,875
- Doctor might not know that.
- Where's his mother?

740
01:26:39,854 --> 01:26:42,880
I don't want to talk about those things.

741
01:26:46,228 --> 01:26:48,458
I see the worst in people, Henry.

742
01:26:50,498 --> 01:26:54,332
I don't need to look past seeing them
to get all I need.

743
01:26:56,504 --> 01:27:00,463
I've built up my hatreds over the years,
little by little.

744
01:27:04,179 --> 01:27:07,512
Having you here
gives me a second breath of life.

745
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:11,344
I can't keep doing this on my own

746
01:27:14,656 --> 01:27:19,719
with these people.

747
01:27:59,567 --> 01:28:02,092
Daniel! Daniel, wake up! Daniel!

748
01:29:44,439 --> 01:29:47,897
Just have to go and have a word
with the conductor.

749
01:29:48,676 --> 01:29:50,769
I'll be right back.

750
01:29:50,912 --> 01:29:55,611
You stay here. You understand?
You stay here.

751
01:29:56,684 --> 01:29:58,515
I'll be right back.

752
01:30:51,239 --> 01:30:53,070
No! No!

753
01:30:54,776 --> 01:30:56,004
No!

754
01:31:05,854 --> 01:31:07,378
- Tilford!
- Plainview.

755
01:31:07,522 --> 01:31:09,820
This is my brother,
Henry Plainview from Fond du Lac.

756
01:31:09,924 --> 01:31:11,551
H.M. Tilford. Pleasure.

757
01:31:11,693 --> 01:31:14,161
Henry Plainview. J.J. Carter.

758
01:31:16,197 --> 01:31:17,562
So...

759
01:31:17,699 --> 01:31:19,326
- Shall we?
- Yes.

760
01:31:27,509 --> 01:31:29,704
How's your boy?

761
01:31:29,844 --> 01:31:33,211
- Thank you for asking.
- Is there anything we can do?

762
01:31:33,348 --> 01:31:35,748
Thanks for asking is enough.

763
01:31:37,418 --> 01:31:39,409
So what are your plans?

764
01:31:41,189 --> 01:31:44,420
Is this about buying up my tracts here?

765
01:31:44,559 --> 01:31:45,617
Yes.

766
01:31:45,727 --> 01:31:48,560
The cable was
about my Coyote Hills lease.

767
01:31:48,696 --> 01:31:52,860
- We'd like that, too.
- What's your offer on Coyote Hills?

768
01:31:53,001 --> 01:31:57,563
- We'll offer 150,000 for full title.
- That's a deal. What's next?

769
01:31:58,406 --> 01:32:02,968
You have 11,000 acres in Little Boston.
You have one proven well

770
01:32:03,077 --> 01:32:04,567
- that was damaged...
- I have three wells proven.

771
01:32:04,712 --> 01:32:08,773
You haven't been paying attention.
That's three proven wells.

772
01:32:13,054 --> 01:32:14,954
We'll make you a millionaire
while you're sitting here

773
01:32:15,056 --> 01:32:17,388
from one minute to the next.

774
01:32:19,227 --> 01:32:21,991
And what else would I do with myself?

775
01:32:23,731 --> 01:32:28,100
- Are you asking me?
- What else would I do with myself?

776
01:32:28,736 --> 01:32:30,829
Take care of your son.

777
01:32:32,507 --> 01:32:34,975
I don't know what you would do.

778
01:32:37,579 --> 01:32:40,047
If you were me and Standard
offered to buy what you had

779
01:32:40,181 --> 01:32:42,843
for a million dollars, why? So, why?

780
01:32:44,085 --> 01:32:45,177
You know why.

781
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:47,151
Yeah, you fellas
should just scratch around in the dirt

782
01:32:47,255 --> 01:32:50,691
and find it like the rest of us, instead of
buying up someone else's hard work.

783
01:32:50,825 --> 01:32:52,759
I've scratched around the dirt, son.

784
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:54,851
You going to change
your shipping costs?

785
01:32:54,996 --> 01:32:57,965
We don't dictate shipping costs.
That's railroad business.

786
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,628
You don't own the railroads?

787
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:08,200
'Course you do. Of course you do.

788
01:33:09,911 --> 01:33:12,345
Where you going to put it all?

789
01:33:13,381 --> 01:33:14,814
Where?

790
01:33:16,651 --> 01:33:20,644
Build a pipeline? Make a deal
with Union Oil? Be my guest.

791
01:33:20,788 --> 01:33:22,449
But if you can't pull it off,

792
01:33:22,557 --> 01:33:26,653
you've got an ocean of oil
under your feet with nowhere to go.

793
01:33:27,662 --> 01:33:32,292
Why not turn it over to us?
We'll make you rich.

794
01:33:32,433 --> 01:33:34,731
You spend time with your boy.

795
01:33:35,803 --> 01:33:37,930
It's a great discovery.

796
01:33:38,873 --> 01:33:40,966
Now, let us help you.

797
01:33:50,184 --> 01:33:53,278
Did you just tell me
how to run my family?

798
01:33:53,421 --> 01:33:55,616
lt might be more important now
that you've proven the field

799
01:33:55,757 --> 01:33:57,622
and we're offering to buy you out.

800
01:33:57,759 --> 01:33:59,954
One night I'm going to come to you,
inside of your house,

801
01:34:00,094 --> 01:34:03,063
or wherever you're sleeping,
and I'm going to cut your throat.

802
01:34:03,164 --> 01:34:04,324
What?

803
01:34:05,099 --> 01:34:06,361
What are you talking about?
Have you gone crazy?

804
01:34:06,467 --> 01:34:07,764
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard what you said,

805
01:34:07,902 --> 01:34:10,370
- why did you say it?
- You don't tell me about my son.

806
01:34:10,471 --> 01:34:12,666
Why are you acting insane
and threatening to cut my throat?

807
01:34:12,774 --> 01:34:15,834
- You don't tell me about my son.
- I'm not telling you anything!

808
01:34:15,943 --> 01:34:19,743
I'm asking you to be reasonable.
If I've offended you, I apologize.

809
01:34:19,881 --> 01:34:22,042
You'll see what I can do.

810
01:34:29,824 --> 01:34:34,022
This parcel here is the 3,000-acre
ranch owned by B.L. Harper.

811
01:34:34,162 --> 01:34:36,653
This is San Luis Obispo County land.

812
01:34:36,798 --> 01:34:38,629
And from here to the coast,
it's all Union Oil.

813
01:34:38,733 --> 01:34:41,861
What's this? Why don't I own this?

814
01:34:44,839 --> 01:34:49,367
- Why don't I own this?
- That's the Bandy tract.

815
01:34:50,178 --> 01:34:53,341
He was the holdout,
when we were doing the buying.

816
01:34:53,448 --> 01:34:55,882
He had hoped to speak with you.

817
01:35:00,088 --> 01:35:03,580
Can't you just build the pipeline
around this tract?

818
01:35:06,561 --> 01:35:10,622
Can I build around 50 miles
of Tehachapi mountains?

819
01:35:10,765 --> 01:35:13,290
Don't be thick in front of me, Al.

820
01:35:13,935 --> 01:35:17,632
- I can go to him again.
- No, I'll go and talk to the man.

821
01:35:17,772 --> 01:35:20,673
I'll talk to him. Show you how it's done.

822
01:35:24,512 --> 01:35:26,946
All right. Pack it up, Henry.

823
01:35:37,291 --> 01:35:41,193
- How big is his room?
- He's sharing with another boy.

824
01:35:41,329 --> 01:35:44,162
- Who?
- An older boy. About 12.

825
01:35:44,265 --> 01:35:47,291
He's been there for a year.
Named Ballard.

826
01:35:52,507 --> 01:35:56,910
- How big is the room?
- It's a fair size. Got enough space.

827
01:35:59,213 --> 01:36:02,444
Are you taking Henry with you
to meet Union Oil?

828
01:36:15,730 --> 01:36:19,291
- Are you the son of William Bandy?
- Grandson.

829
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,163
- Is he here?
- No, he's out.

830
01:36:21,302 --> 01:36:22,360
Where is he?

831
01:36:22,503 --> 01:36:25,370
Told you, he's out.
Now, what do you want?

832
01:36:28,876 --> 01:36:32,812
I'm Daniel Plainview. I want to talk
with him about his property.

833
01:36:32,914 --> 01:36:37,783
- About what?
- I believe I'll talk with him about that.

834
01:36:38,252 --> 01:36:40,686
- You're that oilman, aren't you?
- That's right.

835
01:36:40,822 --> 01:36:42,790
We don't want you drilling out here.

836
01:36:42,890 --> 01:36:46,291
I don't want it either.
Now, when will he be back?

837
01:36:46,394 --> 01:36:47,452
Few days.

838
01:36:47,562 --> 01:36:50,156
Tell him I'd like to speak with him.
Not about drilling.

839
01:36:50,264 --> 01:36:52,494
And I'll be back in a week.

840
01:39:11,605 --> 01:39:13,732
Put that in a glass case.

841
01:39:14,642 --> 01:39:16,507
Here's to Union Oil.

842
01:39:17,211 --> 01:39:18,269
Hundred miles of pipeline,

843
01:39:18,412 --> 01:39:20,846
and all the independent producers
of this great state.

844
01:39:20,948 --> 01:39:21,915
Cheers.

845
01:39:47,074 --> 01:39:49,770
<i>There's that house in Fond du Lac

846
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:54,944
<i>that John Hollister built.
Do you remember it?

847
01:39:57,818 --> 01:40:01,254
I thought as a boy that was
the most beautiful house I'd ever seen,

848
01:40:01,355 --> 01:40:02,982
and I wanted it.

849
01:40:03,724 --> 01:40:06,192
I wanted to live in it.

850
01:40:06,327 --> 01:40:07,851
And eat in it.

851
01:40:08,729 --> 01:40:10,321
And clean it.

852
01:40:13,334 --> 01:40:17,634
And even as a boy, I wanted
to have children to run around in it.

853
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:22,070
You can have
anything you'd like now, Daniel.

854
01:40:22,777 --> 01:40:24,404
And you should.

855
01:40:25,179 --> 01:40:29,843
- Where are you going to build it?
- Here, maybe. Near the ocean.

856
01:40:32,753 --> 01:40:35,517
Would you make it look like that house?

857
01:40:40,261 --> 01:40:43,719
I think if I saw that house now,
it'd make me sick.

858
01:40:50,171 --> 01:40:52,639
We can eat and get some women.

859
01:40:55,609 --> 01:40:57,736
Take them to the Peachtree dance.

860
01:41:01,482 --> 01:41:05,418
I say get liquored up and take them
to the Peachtree dance.

861
01:41:08,322 --> 01:41:09,550
Yeah.

862
01:42:28,502 --> 01:42:30,902
Can I have some money, please?

863
01:42:38,312 --> 01:42:40,712
Can I have some money, please?

864
01:43:29,797 --> 01:43:32,288
I want you to tell me something.

865
01:43:35,970 --> 01:43:37,130
What?

866
01:43:38,172 --> 01:43:41,630
What's the name of the farm
next to the Hill House?

867
01:43:52,686 --> 01:43:57,350
What was the name of the farm
next to the Hill House?

868
01:44:00,894 --> 01:44:03,886
- I can't remember...
- Who are you?

869
01:44:06,834 --> 01:44:08,734
I'll leave, Daniel.

870
01:44:10,504 --> 01:44:12,062
Who are you?

871
01:44:15,409 --> 01:44:16,933
I'm no one.

872
01:44:18,012 --> 01:44:20,276
Just let me get up and go.

873
01:44:22,783 --> 01:44:24,648
Do I have a brother?

874
01:44:28,622 --> 01:44:33,821
I met a man in King City
who said he was your brother.

875
01:44:36,363 --> 01:44:39,457
We were friends for months.

876
01:44:40,934 --> 01:44:42,868
Working in King City.

877
01:44:45,105 --> 01:44:47,972
And he wanted
to make his way to you, Daniel.

878
01:44:49,243 --> 01:44:51,370
We didn't have any money.

879
01:44:56,250 --> 01:44:58,514
He died of tuberculosis.

880
01:44:59,953 --> 01:45:01,784
He wasn't harmed.

881
01:45:02,823 --> 01:45:05,053
Wasn't killed, nothing bad.

882
01:45:06,894 --> 01:45:09,158
But he told me about you,

883
01:45:12,199 --> 01:45:14,497
and I just took his story,

884
01:45:18,205 --> 01:45:20,002
used his diary.

885
01:45:23,644 --> 01:45:24,611
Daniel.

886
01:45:26,246 --> 01:45:29,579
Daniel, I'm your friend.

887
01:45:31,785 --> 01:45:34,219
I'm not trying to hurt you.

888
01:45:34,355 --> 01:45:35,583
Never.

889
01:45:36,724 --> 01:45:38,248
Just survive.

890
01:45:38,792 --> 01:45:40,020
No!

891
01:48:49,650 --> 01:48:51,117
Who is it?

892
01:48:52,419 --> 01:48:53,886
I'm Bandy.

893
01:49:06,667 --> 01:49:08,532
Yes. Yes.

894
01:49:11,038 --> 01:49:12,767
William Bandy.

895
01:49:15,976 --> 01:49:18,604
Yeah, I'd like to lease your land.

896
01:49:21,048 --> 01:49:24,609
I had asked for you
to come and talk to me before.

897
01:49:24,718 --> 01:49:26,982
When you were leasing land.

898
01:49:28,221 --> 01:49:30,018
That's right, yes.

899
01:49:31,725 --> 01:49:34,250
My boy's been very sick, you know.

900
01:49:35,395 --> 01:49:37,920
This was before your boy got sick.

901
01:49:41,034 --> 01:49:45,562
Now, I know
that you would like to build a pipeline

902
01:49:45,706 --> 01:49:48,368
through my property.

903
01:49:48,475 --> 01:49:52,605
- Is that right, what I've heard?
- It's absolutely right. And,

904
01:49:53,313 --> 01:49:54,280
well...

905
01:49:55,582 --> 01:49:58,813
Eight inch pipe.
It could be buried with your consent.

906
01:49:58,952 --> 01:50:01,477
I guarantee you
absolutely no disruption...

907
01:50:01,622 --> 01:50:02,782
God.

908
01:50:04,658 --> 01:50:07,286
God has told me what you must do.

909
01:50:11,665 --> 01:50:13,394
And what is that?

910
01:50:14,368 --> 01:50:18,270
You should be washed
in the blood of Jesus Christ.

911
01:50:20,073 --> 01:50:22,007
But I am.

912
01:50:23,543 --> 01:50:26,239
I have been washed, Mr. Bandy.
I have been.

913
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:32,080
It's your only way to salvation.
And your only way for what you want.

914
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:37,481
You can take it at
the Church of the Third Revelation.

915
01:50:39,926 --> 01:50:41,894
I'll pay you $3,000.

916
01:50:44,531 --> 01:50:47,295
I'd like you to be part of our church.

917
01:50:49,202 --> 01:50:51,102
I'll pay you $5,000.

918
01:50:52,205 --> 01:50:53,672
Be baptized.

919
01:50:55,042 --> 01:50:58,876
Be forgiven for the sin that you've done.

920
01:51:03,150 --> 01:51:08,019
What sin are you referring to,
Mr. Bandy?

921
01:51:09,189 --> 01:51:11,091
My sin of drilling?

922
01:52:01,775 --> 01:52:05,768
<i>I truly wish everyone could be saved,
don't you?

923
01:52:05,912 --> 01:52:07,812
<i>Yes.

924
01:52:07,948 --> 01:52:10,644
<i>I am afraid that's just not the case.

925
01:52:11,518 --> 01:52:16,012
The doctrine of universal salvation
is a lie, is it not?

926
01:52:16,156 --> 01:52:18,784
- It's a lie.
- It's a lie.

927
01:52:18,892 --> 01:52:23,659
I wish everyone could be saved,
but they won't. No, they won't.

928
01:52:23,797 --> 01:52:27,255
You will never be saved if you...

929
01:52:27,367 --> 01:52:29,335
Reject the blood.

930
01:52:30,170 --> 01:52:31,330
Good.

931
01:52:32,405 --> 01:52:36,865
Now, is there a sinner here
looking for salvation?

932
01:52:39,546 --> 01:52:41,138
A new member?

933
01:52:45,619 --> 01:52:47,382
I'll ask it again.

934
01:52:49,389 --> 01:52:52,085
Is there a sinner here looking for God?

935
01:52:52,225 --> 01:52:53,385
Yes.

936
01:52:57,497 --> 01:52:58,930
Allow me.

937
01:53:01,168 --> 01:53:03,932
Thank you for coming, brother Daniel.

938
01:53:06,039 --> 01:53:07,700
Thank you, Eli.

939
01:53:08,842 --> 01:53:13,939
We have a sinner with us here
who wishes for salvation!

940
01:53:14,047 --> 01:53:17,642
- Daniel, are you a sinner?
- Yes.

941
01:53:17,751 --> 01:53:20,447
The Lord can't hear you, Daniel.

942
01:53:20,554 --> 01:53:24,388
Say it to him. Go ahead
and speak to him. It's all right.

943
01:53:25,192 --> 01:53:27,490
- Yes.
- Down on your knees.

944
01:53:27,594 --> 01:53:29,152
Pray to him.

945
01:53:30,564 --> 01:53:34,933
Look up to the sky and say it.

946
01:53:37,537 --> 01:53:39,698
What do you want me to say?

947
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:45,234
Daniel, you've come here and
you've brought good and wealth,

948
01:53:45,345 --> 01:53:49,543
but you have also brought
your bad habits as a backslider.

949
01:53:49,649 --> 01:53:53,915
You've lusted after women,
and you have abandoned your child.

950
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:57,080
Your child, that you raised,
you have abandoned

951
01:53:57,190 --> 01:53:59,624
all because he was sick
and you have sinned.

952
01:53:59,759 --> 01:54:01,920
So say it now. I am a sinner.

953
01:54:02,028 --> 01:54:03,928
- I am a sinner.
- Say it louder.

954
01:54:04,030 --> 01:54:06,760
- I am a sinner.
- I am a sinner.

955
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:08,800
Louder, Daniel! I am a sinner!

956
01:54:08,935 --> 01:54:11,870
- I am a sinner.
- I am sorry, Lord.

957
01:54:11,972 --> 01:54:14,133
- I am sorry, Lord.
- I want the blood.

958
01:54:14,274 --> 01:54:17,641
- I want the blood.
- You have abandoned your child.

959
01:54:18,411 --> 01:54:19,708
I have abandoned my child.

960
01:54:19,813 --> 01:54:22,145
- I will never backslide.
- I will never backslide.

961
01:54:22,282 --> 01:54:25,274
I was lost, but now I am found.

962
01:54:25,418 --> 01:54:29,320
- I was lost, but now I'm found.
- I have abandoned my child.

963
01:54:31,091 --> 01:54:34,254
Say it. Say it.

964
01:54:34,361 --> 01:54:37,387
- I abandoned my child.
- Say it louder. Say it louder!

965
01:54:37,497 --> 01:54:39,590
I've abandoned my child!

966
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:43,025
I've abandoned my child!

967
01:54:43,169 --> 01:54:45,160
I've abandoned my boy!

968
01:54:45,305 --> 01:54:47,705
Now beg for the blood!

969
01:54:48,909 --> 01:54:50,774
Just give me the blood, Eli.
Let me get out of here.

970
01:54:50,877 --> 01:54:53,641
Give me the blood, Lord,
and let me get away!

971
01:54:53,747 --> 01:54:57,513
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Lord and Savior?

972
01:54:57,651 --> 01:55:00,381
- Yes, I do.
- Get out of here, devil!

973
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:03,318
Out, devil! Out, sin!

974
01:55:03,490 --> 01:55:06,015
- Let me feel the power of the Lord, Eli.
- Do you accept

975
01:55:06,159 --> 01:55:10,027
the Church of the Third Revelation
as your spiritual guide?

976
01:55:11,564 --> 01:55:15,762
- Get out of here, ghost!
- Where is your Lord, Eli?

977
01:55:15,902 --> 01:55:19,963
- Get out! Go back where you belong!
- Where is he? There he is!

978
01:55:20,106 --> 01:55:23,701
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Savior?

979
01:55:23,810 --> 01:55:25,243
Yes, I do.

980
01:55:28,014 --> 01:55:32,314
<i>Would you be free
from the burden of sin?

981
01:55:32,452 --> 01:55:34,784
<i>There's power in the blood

982
01:55:34,921 --> 01:55:36,946
<i>Power in the blood

983
01:55:37,223 --> 01:55:39,020
<i>Would you o'er evil a victory win?

984
01:55:39,125 --> 01:55:41,320
There's a pipeline.

985
01:55:41,461 --> 01:55:45,625
<i>There's wonderful power in the blood

986
01:55:45,765 --> 01:55:50,134
<i>There is power, power
wonder-working power

987
01:55:50,236 --> 01:55:53,933
<i>In the blood of the Lamb

988
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:55,803
Praise the Lord!

989
01:56:00,413 --> 01:56:03,280
Welcome to the fold, brother Plainview.

990
01:56:14,627 --> 01:56:16,891
Welcome, brother Daniel.
God bless you.

991
01:56:18,164 --> 01:56:19,597
God bless you.

992
01:56:22,769 --> 01:56:24,430
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

993
01:56:24,871 --> 01:56:26,805
Welcome home, brother.

994
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:30,898
That's enough. That's enough, now.

995
01:56:33,146 --> 01:56:37,310
He must take the spirit in on his own.

996
01:56:40,086 --> 01:56:41,951
We have a new member.

997
01:56:42,088 --> 01:56:44,215
- Yes, brother.
- Hallelujah.

998
01:56:44,324 --> 01:56:46,292
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

999
01:56:48,461 --> 01:56:50,554
- My sweet Mary.
- Mr. Plainview has been generous

1000
01:56:50,663 --> 01:56:53,393
enough to make a $5,000 donation

1001
01:56:53,533 --> 01:56:56,559
to the church
which we are still waiting for.

1002
01:58:08,708 --> 01:58:12,007
That does me good.
That does me good.

1003
01:58:14,114 --> 01:58:15,945
Welcome home, son.

1004
01:58:18,551 --> 01:58:20,519
Welcome home, son.

1005
01:58:24,457 --> 01:58:26,516
This here's George Reynolds.
Teacher from the deaf school.

1006
01:58:26,626 --> 01:58:29,618
- Mr. Plainview.
- Fletcher.

1007
01:58:32,432 --> 01:58:34,525
You're too heavy for me.

1008
01:58:37,604 --> 01:58:40,300
Do you want to get something to eat?

1009
01:58:41,508 --> 01:58:45,808
That's the pipeline, see?
All the way to the sea.

1010
01:59:06,933 --> 01:59:08,491
Come here.

1011
01:59:15,375 --> 01:59:17,138
I love you, son.

1012
01:59:19,045 --> 01:59:21,172
Let's take a look at you.

1013
01:59:23,449 --> 01:59:26,316
All right. That's it, that's it. That's it.

1014
01:59:50,376 --> 01:59:53,675
Let's get some decent food
inside of you.

1015
01:59:53,780 --> 01:59:57,580
That's all we need here
is a good, strong, expensive meal.

1016
01:59:58,218 --> 01:59:59,708
You hungry?

1017
02:00:00,787 --> 02:00:01,879
- Waiter?
- Yes, sir.

1018
02:00:02,021 --> 02:00:05,013
Two steaks, a whiskey,
and water for him.

1019
02:00:06,659 --> 02:00:09,184
- And goat's milk.
- Very good, sir.

1020
02:00:16,002 --> 02:00:18,937
We're going to have
this teacher help you.

1021
02:00:19,505 --> 02:00:23,965
He's going to help take care
of all of this. Understand?

1022
02:00:24,110 --> 02:00:26,806
'Cause I need you. Need your help.

1023
02:00:26,946 --> 02:00:30,905
Got everything we need now
to build this company. Come here.

1024
02:00:38,725 --> 02:00:40,420
Good afternoon.

1025
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:58,635
- How are you doing?
- It's nice to see you again.

1026
02:00:58,745 --> 02:01:01,543
- We need four.
- I'll have them right up.

1027
02:01:05,718 --> 02:01:07,709
- Good afternoon, Daniel.
- Tilford.

1028
02:01:07,820 --> 02:01:09,185
Good afternoon.

1029
02:01:10,757 --> 02:01:16,024
- Hello! H.M. Tilford!
- You don't have to shout.

1030
02:01:18,064 --> 02:01:19,463
Pleasure.

1031
02:01:24,170 --> 02:01:26,434
It's good to be in Little B.

1032
02:01:27,707 --> 02:01:31,006
- Could use some rain out here.
- Yeah, we could.

1033
02:01:31,878 --> 02:01:34,972
- There we go.
- R.J., how's the London broil?

1034
02:01:35,114 --> 02:01:37,776
Believe we ordered these drinks
before those people.

1035
02:01:37,884 --> 02:01:42,150
- R.J., tell us. How's the London broil?
- Excuse me, gentlemen. Sorry.

1036
02:01:44,223 --> 02:01:48,159
I am sorry about that, sir.
I'll have your steaks right out.

1037
02:01:58,004 --> 02:02:00,564
- So that green turtle soup is fantastic.
- Is it?

1038
02:02:00,707 --> 02:02:02,334
lt's delicious.

1039
02:02:07,380 --> 02:02:08,347
Sounds good to me.

1040
02:02:08,481 --> 02:02:14,215
So Standard offered us a million
dollars for the Little Boston leases.

1041
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:17,221
I told H.M. Tilford
where he could shove that.

1042
02:02:17,323 --> 02:02:21,919
And we made a deal with Union!
On the pipeline!

1043
02:02:22,061 --> 02:02:25,519
And that whole ocean of oil
underneath our fields.

1044
02:02:25,631 --> 02:02:27,292
...$150,000.
- Yes.

1045
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:29,698
We needed the money to drill.

1046
02:02:29,836 --> 02:02:32,066
- Who is this guy?
- I go out to meet him.

1047
02:02:32,171 --> 02:02:34,935
He's getting oil on the property.
We're trying to make a claim on it.

1048
02:02:35,074 --> 02:02:36,974
Offered him a million dollars.

1049
02:02:37,110 --> 02:02:40,307
- Turned us down flat.
- Well, I'm hungry.

1050
02:02:40,446 --> 02:02:45,076
Orange fritters,
mashed potatoes, green peas.

1051
02:02:45,184 --> 02:02:47,652
- All the way around?
- All right.

1052
02:02:50,556 --> 02:02:51,921
Hold on.

1053
02:02:55,695 --> 02:02:57,959
I want you to look over there.

1054
02:02:58,064 --> 02:03:00,862
- Daniel, let me introduce...
- Look over there. You see?

1055
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,093
That's my son. See him?

1056
02:03:03,202 --> 02:03:05,534
- Yes.
- Do you see?

1057
02:03:07,874 --> 02:03:09,307
I see him.

1058
02:03:10,176 --> 02:03:13,043
You don't tell me
how to raise my family.

1059
02:03:15,181 --> 02:03:18,708
I told you not to tell me
how to raise my family.

1060
02:03:20,186 --> 02:03:22,051
Daniel...

1061
02:03:22,889 --> 02:03:24,720
So what do you see?

1062
02:03:26,726 --> 02:03:29,889
- I'm very happy for you that the deal...
- Yes, I made a deal with Union.

1063
02:03:29,996 --> 02:03:32,362
- My son is happy. He's safe.
- Congratulations.

1064
02:03:32,465 --> 02:03:35,628
- I'm taking care of him now, so...
- Excellent.

1065
02:03:36,936 --> 02:03:39,928
You look like a fool, don't you, Tilford?

1066
02:03:44,610 --> 02:03:47,443
- Yes.
- Yes.

1067
02:03:49,282 --> 02:03:50,943
Yes, you do.

1068
02:03:51,851 --> 02:03:53,318
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1069
02:03:53,653 --> 02:03:56,884
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Excuse him, gentlemen.

1070
02:04:00,426 --> 02:04:03,054
I told you what I was going to do.

1071
02:04:13,372 --> 02:04:14,600
My son.

1072
02:04:32,658 --> 02:04:35,957
Mr. Sunday, I understand
that you're leaving our fair community.

1073
02:04:36,095 --> 02:04:39,223
- Yes, I'm going on a mission.
- Where you going?

1074
02:04:39,332 --> 02:04:41,493
Oildale, Taft,
and then on to Bakersfield.

1075
02:04:41,634 --> 02:04:43,966
Well, I want you to know...

1076
02:04:44,103 --> 02:04:45,968
Three quarters of an hour.

1077
02:04:46,105 --> 02:04:47,629
...you done a great job for us.

1078
02:04:47,773 --> 02:04:50,640
- Thank you. You will be in my prayers.
- I thank you very much.

1079
02:04:50,743 --> 02:04:54,008
Union Oil Company,
Santa Paula, California.

1080
02:07:03,009 --> 02:07:06,809
"The woman saith unto him,
'Sir, give me this water

1081
02:07:07,847 --> 02:07:12,807
"'and I shall thirst not,
neither come hither to draw."'

1082
02:08:54,320 --> 02:08:55,981
Come in, come in.

1083
02:09:22,748 --> 02:09:24,978
Can we be alone?

1084
02:09:25,084 --> 02:09:28,781
This is my closest associate.
He hears everything.

1085
02:09:35,861 --> 02:09:40,924
- I'd prefer to speak to you in private.
- You can't speak.

1086
02:09:41,033 --> 02:09:43,263
So why don't you flap your hands about

1087
02:09:43,369 --> 02:09:46,930
and have what's-his-name tell me
where you've been.

1088
02:09:54,914 --> 02:09:57,644
Or do you think I don't know?

1089
02:10:12,131 --> 02:10:14,361
This is hard for me to say.

1090
02:10:15,467 --> 02:10:19,597
I'll tell you first, I love you very much.

1091
02:10:22,875 --> 02:10:26,868
I've learned to love what I do
because of you.

1092
02:10:30,316 --> 02:10:32,181
I'm leaving here.

1093
02:10:33,619 --> 02:10:35,951
I'm going to Mexico.

1094
02:10:36,088 --> 02:10:39,057
I'm taking Mary,
and I'm going to Mexico.

1095
02:10:40,726 --> 02:10:42,819
I miss working outside.

1096
02:10:43,863 --> 02:10:45,728
I miss the fields.

1097
02:10:48,701 --> 02:10:50,828
It'll only be for a time,

1098
02:10:52,037 --> 02:10:54,369
for me to do my own drilling

1099
02:10:56,075 --> 02:10:58,202
and start my own company.

1100
02:11:01,213 --> 02:11:05,673
It's time to make a change.

1101
02:11:18,731 --> 02:11:21,222
This makes you my competitor.

1102
02:11:25,204 --> 02:11:30,301
- No. No, it's not like that.
- It is like that, boy.

1103
02:11:31,543 --> 02:11:33,511
Your own company, huh?

1104
02:11:33,946 --> 02:11:35,436
That's right.

1105
02:11:37,783 --> 02:11:39,546
In Mexico?

1106
02:11:41,020 --> 02:11:42,078
Yes.

1107
02:11:42,187 --> 02:11:47,250
You are making such a misstep.
So, what are you doing?

1108
02:11:49,295 --> 02:11:52,628
I know you and I
have disagreed over many things.

1109
02:11:53,565 --> 02:11:57,899
I'd rather keep you as my father
than my partner.

1110
02:11:58,003 --> 02:11:59,470
Then say it.

1111
02:11:59,605 --> 02:12:01,300
If you've got something to say to me,
then say it.

1112
02:12:01,407 --> 02:12:05,070
I'd like to hear you speak
instead of your little dog.

1113
02:12:23,195 --> 02:12:25,857
I'm going to Mexico with my wife.

1114
02:12:26,865 --> 02:12:28,992
I'm going away from you.

1115
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:37,702
That wasn't so hard, was it?

1116
02:12:39,645 --> 02:12:42,273
Killing us with what you're doing.

1117
02:12:45,184 --> 02:12:48,642
You're killing my image of you
as my son.

1118
02:12:48,787 --> 02:12:52,154
You are stubborn. You won't listen.

1119
02:12:52,291 --> 02:12:54,589
You're not my son.

1120
02:12:54,693 --> 02:12:57,890
Please don't say that.
I know you don't mean it.

1121
02:12:57,997 --> 02:13:01,956
It's the truth. You're not my son.
You never have been.

1122
02:13:03,335 --> 02:13:05,132
You're an orphan!

1123
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:10,070
Did you ever hear that word?

1124
02:13:11,577 --> 02:13:13,477
Tell him what I said.

1125
02:13:14,246 --> 02:13:17,215
You operated here today like one.

1126
02:13:18,851 --> 02:13:21,319
I should have seen this coming.

1127
02:13:22,821 --> 02:13:27,656
I should have known that,
under this all, these past years

1128
02:13:27,793 --> 02:13:31,160
you've been building new hate for me,
piece by piece.

1129
02:13:31,296 --> 02:13:34,925
I don't even know who you are
because you have none of me in you.

1130
02:13:35,034 --> 02:13:37,901
You're someone else's.

1131
02:13:39,338 --> 02:13:42,796
This anger. Your maliciousness.

1132
02:13:43,909 --> 02:13:46,810
Backwards dealings with me.

1133
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:52,439
You're an orphan from a basket
in the middle of the desert.

1134
02:13:55,254 --> 02:14:00,214
And I took you for no other reason
than I needed a sweet face to buy land.

1135
02:14:01,727 --> 02:14:03,490
Did you get that?

1136
02:14:04,730 --> 02:14:06,493
So now you know.

1137
02:14:09,802 --> 02:14:14,102
Look at me!
You're lower than a bastard.

1138
02:14:39,064 --> 02:14:43,524
You have none of me in you.
You're just a bastard from a basket.

1139
02:14:53,212 --> 02:14:57,478
I thank God I have none of you in me.

1140
02:15:02,387 --> 02:15:06,847
Not my son.
Just a little piece of competition.

1141
02:15:08,760 --> 02:15:10,853
Bastard from a basket.

1142
02:15:13,265 --> 02:15:15,460
Bastard from a basket!

1143
02:15:23,842 --> 02:15:26,367
You're a bastard from a basket!

1144
02:16:28,907 --> 02:16:30,704
<i>Get up, Mr. Daniel.

1145
02:16:35,080 --> 02:16:36,638
<i>Mr. Daniel.

1146
02:16:38,617 --> 02:16:41,177
Mr. Daniel, you've got a visitor.

1147
02:16:44,856 --> 02:16:46,687
Wake up, Mr. Daniel.

1148
02:16:49,428 --> 02:16:51,020
Sir?

1149
02:17:04,543 --> 02:17:06,477
You can leave us now.

1150
02:17:14,786 --> 02:17:15,753
Daniel.

1151
02:17:19,124 --> 02:17:20,284
Daniel.

1152
02:17:22,894 --> 02:17:26,091
Daniel Plainview, the house is on fire!

1153
02:17:30,769 --> 02:17:33,738
Brother Daniel, it's Eli.

1154
02:17:43,982 --> 02:17:47,713
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

1155
02:17:49,821 --> 02:17:51,755
I'll make us a drink.

1156
02:17:58,330 --> 02:18:01,493
Your home is a miracle.

1157
02:18:02,768 --> 02:18:04,036
It's beautiful.

1158
02:18:04,036 --> 02:18:04,400
It's beautiful.

1159
02:18:05,037 --> 02:18:07,096
God bless it.

1160
02:18:07,239 --> 02:18:11,232
I've been spreading His word
far and wide.

1161
02:18:12,511 --> 02:18:14,308
Far and wide.

1162
02:18:16,114 --> 02:18:18,878
So much travel for Him.

1163
02:18:23,588 --> 02:18:25,988
I've been working in radio.

1164
02:18:28,694 --> 02:18:32,653
Yes, so much...
So much has been happening.

1165
02:18:33,699 --> 02:18:39,160
To be here and find you
and see you well is wonderful.

1166
02:18:39,304 --> 02:18:41,864
And we have a chance to catch up.

1167
02:18:55,020 --> 02:18:57,079
No. Thank you so much.

1168
02:19:15,207 --> 02:19:16,731
My brother.

1169
02:19:18,143 --> 02:19:21,408
Daniel, my brother by marriage.

1170
02:19:23,415 --> 02:19:27,511
We're such old friends. So much time.

1171
02:19:34,025 --> 02:19:37,119
Things go up, things go down,

1172
02:19:37,229 --> 02:19:41,529
but at least the Lord is always around.

1173
02:19:43,135 --> 02:19:45,797
We've seen ups and downs,
haven't we?

1174
02:19:49,608 --> 02:19:52,577
Are things down for you right now, Eli?

1175
02:19:53,945 --> 02:19:55,344
No. No.

1176
02:19:57,783 --> 02:20:00,411
But I do come with some sad news.

1177
02:20:02,154 --> 02:20:04,884
Perhaps you remember Mr. Bandy?

1178
02:20:07,526 --> 02:20:10,859
Mr. Bandy has passed on to the Lord.

1179
02:20:11,797 --> 02:20:14,960
He lived to be 99 years old,
God bless him.

1180
02:20:15,667 --> 02:20:19,535
Mr. Bandy has a grandson.
Have you met his grandson, William?

1181
02:20:20,539 --> 02:20:25,135
William Bandy is one of
the finest members we have

1182
02:20:25,243 --> 02:20:27,803
at the Church of the Third Revelation.

1183
02:20:27,913 --> 02:20:31,212
He's eager to come to Hollywood
to be in movies.

1184
02:20:32,684 --> 02:20:34,845
He is very good-looking.

1185
02:20:37,055 --> 02:20:42,049
- And I do think he will have success.
- That's wonderful.

1186
02:20:44,196 --> 02:20:46,960
Would you like me to speak with him?

1187
02:20:54,372 --> 02:20:59,105
Daniel, I'm asking
if you'd like to have business

1188
02:20:59,244 --> 02:21:01,474
with the Church of the Third Revelation

1189
02:21:01,580 --> 02:21:05,812
in developing this lease
on young Bandy's 1,000-acre tract.

1190
02:21:08,286 --> 02:21:09,878
I'm offering you to drill

1191
02:21:10,021 --> 02:21:13,479
on one of the great undeveloped fields
of Little Boston.

1192
02:21:13,592 --> 02:21:17,722
- I'd be happy to work with you.
- You would?

1193
02:21:19,331 --> 02:21:22,164
Yes, yes, of course. That's wonderful.

1194
02:21:22,300 --> 02:21:25,269
But there is one condition for this work.

1195
02:21:25,370 --> 02:21:26,860
All right.

1196
02:21:28,940 --> 02:21:32,467
I'd like you to tell me
that you are a false prophet.

1197
02:21:37,849 --> 02:21:43,253
I'd like you to tell me that you are,
and have been a false prophet.

1198
02:21:44,456 --> 02:21:46,822
And that God is a superstition.

1199
02:21:52,931 --> 02:21:54,728
But that's a lie.

1200
02:21:57,536 --> 02:22:00,061
It's a lie. I cannot say it.

1201
02:22:14,352 --> 02:22:16,786
- When can we begin to drill?
- Very soon.

1202
02:22:16,888 --> 02:22:18,480
How long will it take
to bring in the well?

1203
02:22:18,623 --> 02:22:20,523
lt shouldn't take long.

1204
02:22:20,659 --> 02:22:23,924
I would like a $100,000 signing bonus,

1205
02:22:24,029 --> 02:22:27,294
plus the five that is owed to me
with interest.

1206
02:22:27,999 --> 02:22:29,762
That's only fair.

1207
02:22:35,540 --> 02:22:40,307
I am a false prophet,
and God is a superstition.

1208
02:22:40,445 --> 02:22:43,414
If that's what you believe,
then I will say it.

1209
02:22:43,515 --> 02:22:47,007
- Say it like you mean it.
- Daniel.

1210
02:22:47,552 --> 02:22:49,884
Say it like it's your sermon.

1211
02:22:53,058 --> 02:22:54,685
Don't smile.

1212
02:23:00,465 --> 02:23:02,365
I am a false prophet.

1213
02:23:02,467 --> 02:23:05,800
- God is a superstition.
- Why don't you stand up?

1214
02:23:08,873 --> 02:23:10,864
Put your glass down.

1215
02:23:23,054 --> 02:23:26,615
I am a false prophet.

1216
02:23:26,758 --> 02:23:29,818
- God is a superstition.
- Eli, stop.

1217
02:23:29,928 --> 02:23:35,332
Just imagine this is your church here
and you have a full congregation, so...

1218
02:23:37,869 --> 02:23:41,635
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1219
02:23:41,740 --> 02:23:43,332
Say it again.

1220
02:23:44,409 --> 02:23:48,277
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1221
02:23:48,380 --> 02:23:49,506
They can't hear you at the back.

1222
02:23:49,648 --> 02:23:53,015
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1223
02:23:53,151 --> 02:23:54,175
Say it again.

1224
02:23:54,319 --> 02:23:58,949
I am a false prophet!
God is a superstition!

1225
02:23:59,057 --> 02:24:00,752
Say it again.

1226
02:24:00,859 --> 02:24:04,590
I am a false prophet!
God is a superstition!

1227
02:24:05,797 --> 02:24:08,129
Those areas have been drilled.

1228
02:24:11,236 --> 02:24:12,635
What?

1229
02:24:12,771 --> 02:24:15,365
Those areas, they've been drilled.

1230
02:24:16,975 --> 02:24:20,502
- No, they haven't.
- Yes, it's...

1231
02:24:20,612 --> 02:24:21,943
It's called drainage, Eli.

1232
02:24:22,080 --> 02:24:26,915
See, I own everything around it, so,
of course, I get what's underneath it.

1233
02:24:28,386 --> 02:24:31,549
But there are no derricks there.

1234
02:24:31,690 --> 02:24:34,056
This is the Bandy tract.
Do you understand?

1235
02:24:34,192 --> 02:24:36,160
Do you understand, Eli?

1236
02:24:36,895 --> 02:24:40,126
That's more to the point.
Do you understand?

1237
02:24:40,231 --> 02:24:45,635
I drink your water. I drink it up every day.

1238
02:24:46,638 --> 02:24:50,870
I drink the blood of Lamb
from Bandy's tract.

1239
02:24:56,147 --> 02:24:58,240
You can sit down again.

1240
02:25:16,401 --> 02:25:17,732
Daniel.

1241
02:25:21,005 --> 02:25:21,994
Daniel.

1242
02:25:25,877 --> 02:25:27,174
Please.

1243
02:25:29,814 --> 02:25:34,148
- I am in desperate times.
- I know.

1244
02:25:34,252 --> 02:25:37,119
- I need a friend.
- Yes. Of course, you do.

1245
02:25:37,522 --> 02:25:39,114
I've sinned.

1246
02:25:40,892 --> 02:25:43,986
I need help. I'm a sinner.

1247
02:25:44,129 --> 02:25:48,725
I've let the devil grab hold of me
in ways I never imagined.

1248
02:25:48,833 --> 02:25:50,266
I'm so full of sin.

1249
02:25:50,368 --> 02:25:53,633
The Lord sometimes challenges us,
doesn't He, Eli?

1250
02:25:53,772 --> 02:25:55,740
- Yes, He does, Daniel.
- Yes, He does.

1251
02:25:55,840 --> 02:25:58,434
Yes, He does!

1252
02:25:58,576 --> 02:26:00,476
Yes, He does!

1253
02:26:01,780 --> 02:26:07,343
He's completely failed to alert me
to the recent panic in our economy.

1254
02:26:07,452 --> 02:26:09,613
- And this...
- Oh, dear.

1255
02:26:09,754 --> 02:26:16,421
I must have this, Daniel.
I must, I must, I must have this.

1256
02:26:16,561 --> 02:26:18,825
My investments have...

1257
02:26:18,930 --> 02:26:23,958
Daniel, I won't bore you, but if I could
grab the Lord's hand for help I would,

1258
02:26:24,068 --> 02:26:26,969
but He does these things all the time.

1259
02:26:27,071 --> 02:26:31,030
These mysteries that He presents,
and while we wait...

1260
02:26:32,310 --> 02:26:34,471
While we wait for His word!

1261
02:26:34,612 --> 02:26:37,348
Because you're not
the chosen brother, Eli.

1262
02:26:37,348 --> 02:26:37,575
Because you're not
the chosen brother, Eli.

1263
02:26:39,984 --> 02:26:43,784
'Twas Paul who was chosen.

1264
02:26:44,689 --> 02:26:47,624
He found me and told me
about your land. You're just a fool.

1265
02:26:47,759 --> 02:26:50,592
- Why are you talking about Paul?
- I did what your brother couldn't.

1266
02:26:50,695 --> 02:26:53,220
- Don't say this to me.
- I broke you and I beat you.

1267
02:26:54,132 --> 02:26:56,930
It was Paul told me about you.

1268
02:26:57,068 --> 02:27:01,528
He's the prophet. He's the smart one.
He knew what was there

1269
02:27:01,639 --> 02:27:04,005
and he found me to take it
out of the ground.

1270
02:27:04,108 --> 02:27:07,202
Know what the funny thing is?
Listen, listen.

1271
02:27:08,079 --> 02:27:11,981
I paid him $10,000 cash in hand.
Just like that.

1272
02:27:13,017 --> 02:27:16,350
He has his own company now.
Prosperous little business.

1273
02:27:16,454 --> 02:27:19,981
Three wells producing, $5,000 a week.

1274
02:27:22,060 --> 02:27:25,860
Stop crying, you sniveling ass.
Stop your nonsense.

1275
02:27:27,065 --> 02:27:30,899
- You're just the afterbirth, Eli.
- No.

1276
02:27:31,002 --> 02:27:33,630
That slithered out on your mother's filth.

1277
02:27:33,771 --> 02:27:35,102
No.

1278
02:27:35,206 --> 02:27:39,404
They should've put you in a glass jar
on the mantelpiece.

1279
02:27:41,112 --> 02:27:44,479
Where were you when Paul
was suckling at his mother's teat?

1280
02:27:44,616 --> 02:27:46,106
Where were you?

1281
02:27:46,251 --> 02:27:50,950
Who was nursing you, poor Eli?
One of Bandy's sows?

1282
02:27:51,089 --> 02:27:54,024
That land has been had.
Nothing you can do about it. It's gone.

1283
02:27:54,125 --> 02:27:56,286
- lf you would just take this lease...
- You lose.

1284
02:27:56,427 --> 02:27:59,658
Drainage!

1285
02:28:00,698 --> 02:28:04,259
Drainage, Eli, you boy.

1286
02:28:05,403 --> 02:28:08,304
Drained dry. I'm so sorry.

1287
02:28:09,540 --> 02:28:11,633
If you have a milkshake

1288
02:28:12,744 --> 02:28:14,507
and I have a milkshake,

1289
02:28:14,612 --> 02:28:17,809
and I have a straw, there it is.
That's the straw, you see?

1290
02:28:17,916 --> 02:28:19,474
Watch it.

1291
02:28:20,919 --> 02:28:27,848
Now my straw reaches across the room

1292
02:28:29,127 --> 02:28:31,925
and starts to drink your milkshake.

1293
02:28:32,864 --> 02:28:36,630
I drink your milkshake!

1294
02:28:38,836 --> 02:28:42,294
- I drink it up!
- Don't bully me, Daniel.

1295
02:28:45,043 --> 02:28:50,242
Did you think your song and dance and
your superstition would help you, Eli?

1296
02:28:50,381 --> 02:28:55,011
I am the Third Revelation.
I am who the Lord has chosen.

1297
02:28:57,221 --> 02:28:59,519
- Daniel!
- Because I'm smarter than you!

1298
02:28:59,624 --> 02:29:01,091
I'm older!

1299
02:29:01,926 --> 02:29:03,757
I'm your old friend, Daniel!

1300
02:29:03,861 --> 02:29:06,295
- I'm not a false prophet...
- Help me! Help me!

1301
02:29:06,397 --> 02:29:08,661
...you sniveling boy!

1302
02:29:08,766 --> 02:29:15,433
I am the Third Revelation!
I am the Third Revelation!

1303
02:29:15,540 --> 02:29:18,509
- I told you I would eat you.
- We're family!

1304
02:29:18,643 --> 02:29:23,080
- I told you I would eat you up!
- We're brothers! We're brothers!

1305
02:29:30,188 --> 02:29:32,986
Daniel, please forgive me. I beg you.

1306
02:29:36,661 --> 02:29:38,720
That's it. That's it.

1307
02:30:41,125 --> 02:30:42,592
Mr. Daniel?

1308
02:30:50,501 --> 02:30:52,162
I'm finished.
