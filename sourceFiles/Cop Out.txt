get anything they want.

333
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,533
I'm the second husband.

334
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,952
[LAUGHS]

335
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:49,205
And $50,000 for Ava's happiness...

336
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,791
...that's nothing to me.

337
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,834
You know, that's a weekend in Vegas.

338
00:20:55,170 --> 00:21:00,257
Now, if you can't afford
to pay for your daughter's wedding...

339
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,218
...I will.

340
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:06,430
Because a deadbeat ex-husband...

341
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,266
...who never had to pay any alimony...

342
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,727
...you're welcome, by the way...

343
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:15,523
...and can't pay
for his only daughter's wedding?

344
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:21,362
Ooh. To me? That's a bad guy.

345
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,367
So why don't you go ahead...

346
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:30,705
...and keep your little promise
to the great city of New York.

347
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,208
Take that gun of yours...

348
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,545
...and shoot yourself, Serpico.

349
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:41,382
- Daddy? Can I talk to you?
- Of course. Of course.

350
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,300
Excuse me, Roy.

351
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,430
Prick.

352
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,558
I don't have to have the big wedding
if it's too much.

353
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,102
We can just have something small
with a few friends.

354
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,855
Oh, baby, come here.
Are you kidding me?

355
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,525
You are gonna have the wedding
that you always wanted.

356
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:03,070
Big, all your friends, everybody.

357
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,656
Even your mom's gonna be happy.

358
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,324
Stop worrying, all right?

359
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,993
- Really?
- Really.

360
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,327
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

361
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,204
Because I really want a big wedding.

362
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,623
You're gonna get a big wedding.
What'd I tell you?

363
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,500
Gotta stop listening to this
knucklehead.

364
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,252
- Is he looking at me right now?
- Mm-hm.

365
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,503
Fuck him.

366
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,280
What the fuck?

367
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,452
What the...?

368
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,290
Mother...

369
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,399
Hey, Big Al, how you doing?
Jimmy Monroe.

370
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,820
Listen, I gotta sell the Pafko.

371
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,656
See if you can find a buyer for me,
all right?

372
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,166
Good morning, Deborah.

373
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,795
Good morning, Paul.

374
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,806
Is this yours from last night?

375
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,516
You got me, Paul.

376
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:59,937
I was celebrating
because I finally closed the ramen account.

377
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:02,857
I forgot.

378
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:07,486
Noodles every day, every hour of the day,
and you just forgot?

379
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,821
Don't change the subject.

380
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,532
Did you drink this bottle of champagne
by yourself?

381
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,367
No, I didn't. I had some help.

382
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,869
- Who?
- Henry.

383
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,704
- Henry?
- Henry.

384
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:20,291
- Our neighbor, next door?
- Henry, the next door neighbor.

385
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,376
How he get involved in our celebration?

386
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,004
Our celebration? You weren't even here.

387
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,721
I'm doing that thing again, right?

388
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,849
- Paul.
- But, baby, you my tenderoni.

389
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,560
- And I get insecure.
- I know that I'm lucky to have you.

390
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:44,064
I love you and I married you because
you're funny, and you're smart.

391
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,233
And I'm orally fixated.

392
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,818
That's going too far.

393
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,656
You have no need to be jealous
of Henry or anybody else, okay?

394
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,910
I'm yours. You have to believe that.

395
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,579
You know you got me open
like a research monkey?

396
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,999
- I don't know what that means.
- Can I get some?

397
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,923
I love you, booby. Give me some of that.

398
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,760
Hi.

399
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,388
Hi, Henry.

400
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,309
I'm gonna go take a shower.
I'll see you tonight.

401
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,958
You gonna be my eyes, little bear.

402
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,387
What's with the box?

403
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,139
Gotta sell the Pafko.

404
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,892
I heard that. I know that's right.

405
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:06,230
- I'm lying. What's a Pafko?
- It's a baseball card.

406
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,440
Baseball card?

407
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:12,820
- Jim, listen, if you need 20 bucks, I got...
- Asshole, I don't need 20 bucks.

408
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,406
I'm selling it
to cover my daughter's wedding.

409
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:17,908
So how much is that thing worth?

410
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,496
JIMMY:
Well, it's a gem mint 10 Andy Pafko.

411
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:27,167
In 1952, when the Topps gum company
came out with the first baseball cards...

412
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:31,255
...Andy Pafko was number one,
the first card in that set.

413
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,341
Kids would collect the cards, right?

414
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:38,262
Then they'd stack them up,
wrap rubber bands around them.

415
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,264
My pop...

416
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,683
...never wrapped rubber bands
around his cards.

417
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,185
Loved Andy Pafko.

418
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,354
Always took good care of him.

419
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:53,485
About four or five years ago, they sold one
of these at auction for about $83,000.

420
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,363
Eighty-three thousand grand?

421
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,992
Yeah. My daughter's wedding's gonna
cost 48,000.

422
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,287
You're about to come off like a fat rat
in a cheese factory, Jim.

423
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,039
Yeah, that's if we get 80.

424
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,208
I'd rather chew my own arm off than to
have that guy Roy...

425
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:12,046
...stand up and take credit for it all.
- I hear you.

426
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,185
I'm gonna stay out here
and I'm gonna call Debbie.

427
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,145
Oh, good.

Mr. Monroe.

430
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,618
- Is that it? Is that the Pafko?
- Yeah. That's it.

431
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,496
Just got off the phone with a buyer
and he's gotta have it.

432
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:48,540
And I just have to appraise it.
Can I take it out?

433
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:52,378
- You're talking about the card, right?
- For the next four weeks, fuck this job.

434
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:56,131
I'm coming home to you. It's gonna be
me and you. We gonna get freaky.

435
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,926

You're not gonna take it out...

- But l...

438
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,602
Dave. You want me to grab the cards?

00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,270
Put your mask back on.

DAVE: He's calling me Dave
because it's not my real name.

441
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,194
Just grab anything that looks old.
He pays big for old shit like this.

You know, running around the house
with the doo-doo Pamper on.

446
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,051
- This guy's got a gun.
- What?

I just wanna be home with you. You know?

Now, you've been the victim of a crime,

I don't have time for this shit.

458
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,709
Whoa. Whoa, guy.

459
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:19,131
Based on the emotional state, how should
we proceed? What do you think?

all with similar M.O.s.

All in Queens, five in Far Rockaway.

469
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:51,371
It just got me to thinking
maybe our guy...

470
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:55,042
...got his tattoo from a local parlor
in the neighborhood.

471
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,838
Now, here comes the genius.
Check it out. Bust it, it might blind you.

472
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,716

to tell her friends about.

"My son is a genius.
My son is a genius. He's a genius."

using the robberies as a radius...

he might have given somebody...

who Dave is...

...before he draws two unicorns
fucking on your face.

- Dave owes me money.
