1
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,067
Thebes, City of the Living,

2
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,861
crown Jewel of Pharaoh
SETI the First.

3
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:21,033
Home of Imhotep,
Pharaoh's high priest,

4
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,238
keeper of the dead.

5
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,702
Birthplace of Anck-Su-Namun,
Pharaoh's mistress.

6
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,413
No other man was allowed
to touch her...

7
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:58,524
But for their love, they were
willing to risk life itself.

8
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,384
What are you doing here?

9
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,113
Who has touched you?!

10
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,207
Imhotep?!

11
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,293
My Priest!

12
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:10,854
Pharaoh's bodyguards.

13
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,900
- You must go! Save yourself!
- No!

14
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,945
Only you can resurrect me!

15
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,659
I won't leave you!
Get away from me!

16
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,532
You shall live again!

17
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,624
I will resurrect you!

18
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,499
My body is no longer his Temple!

19
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,722
To resurrect Anck-Su-Namun,

20
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:53,931
Imhotep and his priests broke into
her crypt and stole her body.

21
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,441
They raced deep into the desert,

22
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,315
taking Anck-Su-Namun's corpse to
Hamunaptra, City of the Dead,

23
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,646
HAMUNAPTRA - 1290 B.C.

24
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,699
ancient burial site for
the sons of pharaohs

25
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,827
and resting place for
the wealth of Egypt.

26
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:14,793
For his love, Imhotep dared the gods'
anger by going deep into the city,

27
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:19,172
where he took the black Book of the
Dead from it's holy resting place.

28
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,340
Anck-Su-Namun's soul had been
sent to the dark underworld,

29
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:29,675
her vital organs removed and placed
in five sacred Canopic jars.

30
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:02,086
Anck-Su-Namun's soul had
come back from the dead,

31
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,674
but Pharaoh's bodyguards had
followed lmhotep and stopped him

32
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,222
before the ritual
could be completed.

33
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:26,072
Imhotep's priests were condemned
to be mummified alive.

34
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:41,793
As for. Imhotep, he was condemned
to endure the Hom-Dai,

35
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,507
the worst of all ancient curses.

36
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,920
One so horrible, it had
never before been bestowed.

37
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,051
He was to remain sealed
inside his sarcophagus,

38
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,681
be undead for all of eternity.

39
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,227
The Magi would never allow
him to be released,

40
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:41,353
for he would arise a walking
disease, a plague upon mankind,

41
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,768
an unholy flesh-eater with
the strength of ages,

42
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:49,197
power over the sands, and
the Glory of invincibility.

43
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,230
HAMUNAPTRA - 1923

44
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,942
For 3,000 years, men and
armies fought over this land,

45
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,528
never knowing what
evil lay beneath it.

46
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,506
And for 3,000 years,
we, the Magi,

47
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:52,336
the descendants of Pharaoh's
sacred bodyguards, kept watch.

48
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,397
You just got promoted.

49
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,068
Steady!

50
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:21,406
- You're with me on this one, right?
- Your strength gives me strength.

51
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,417
Steady!

52
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,756
Wait! Wait for me!

53
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,339
Steady!

54
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:39,925
Fire!

55
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,224
Run, Beni! Run!

56
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:10,190
Get inside! Get inside!

57
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,607
Hey! Don't you close that door!

58
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,733
Don't you close that door!

59
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:20,419
You will die. You will die.

60
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,293
The Creature remains
undiscovered.

61
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,084
And what of this one?

62
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,935
- Should we kill him?
- No.

63
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,602
The desert will kill him.

64
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,614
CAIRO, EGYPT - 3 YEARS LATER

65
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,999
Sacred stones,

66
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,172
sculpture and aesthetics,

67
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:46,176
Socrates, Seth, volume
one, volume two,

68
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,552
and volume three.

69
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,675
And...

70
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:54,888
Tuthmosis. What are
you doing here?

71
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,432
T. T, t, t...

72
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,059
T.

73
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,025
I'm going to put you
where you belong!

74
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,456
Help.

75
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:50,986
Oops.

76
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,196
What... How...

77
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,500
Oh, look at this!

78
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,257
Sons of the pharaohs!

79
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:08,386
Give me frogs! Flies! Locusts!

80
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,429
Anything but you!

81
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,009
Compared to you, the other
plagues were a Joy!

82
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,810
I am so very sorry.
It was an accident.

83
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:21,187
My girl, when Rameses destroyed
Syria, that was an accident.

84
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,981
You are a catastrophe!

85
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,108
Look at my library!

86
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,318
Why do I put up with you?

87
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,868
Well, you put up with
me because I can...

88
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,741
I can read and write
Ancient Egyptian,

89
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,537
and I can... I can decipher
hieroglyphics and hieratic,

90
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:42,166
and, well, I am the only
person within 1,000 Miles

91
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,498
who knows how to properly code and
catalog this library, that's why.

92
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:49,211
I put up with you because your father
and mother were our finest patrons.

93
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,670
That's why!

94
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,884
Allah rest their souls.

95
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,973
Now, I don't care how you do it,
I don't care how long it takes,

96
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,521
straighten up this meshiver!

97
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,536
Hello?

98
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,847
Abdul?

99
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,354
Mohammed?

100
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,529
Bob?

101
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,928
Have you no respect
for the dead?

102
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:20,435
Of course I do. But sometimes
I'd rather like to join them.

103
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,981
Well, I wish you would do it before you
ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.

104
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,400
- Now, get out. - My
dear, sweet baby sister.

105
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,649
I'll have you know

106
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,777
that, at this precise moment,
my career is on a high note.

107
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:37,156
High note, ha! Jonathan, please, I'm
really not in the mood for you.

108
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,658
I've just made a bit of
a mess in the library,

109
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,661
and the Bembridge scholars have
rejected my application form again.

110
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,869
They say I don't have enough
experience in the field.

111
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,092
You'll always have me, old mum.

112
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,094
Besides, I have just the
thing to cheer you up.

113
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:02,598
Oh, no, Jonathan, not
another worthless trinket.

114
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,680
If I have to take one more piece
of junk to the curator to try and

115
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,311
sell for you.

116
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,111
Where did you get this?

117
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,315
On a dig down in Thebes.

118
00:17:16,795 --> 00:17:18,596
My whole life, I've never
found anything, Evy.

119
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,203
Please tell me I've
found something.

120
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,744
- Jonathan.
- Yes?

121
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,838
I think you've found something.

122
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,381
You see the cartouche there?

123
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,964
It's the official Royal seal of
SETI the First, I'm sure of it.

124
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,050
- Perhaps.
- Two questions.

125
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,886
Who the hell was SETI the
First, and was he rich?

126
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,313
He was the second pharaoh
of the 19th dynasty,

127
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,201
said to be the wealthiest
pharaoh of them all.

128
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,725
Good. I like this fellow.

129
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,232
- I like him very much.
- I've already dated the map.

130
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,858
It's almost 3,000 years old.

131
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:59,318
And if you look at the hieratic
just here, well, it's Hamunaptra.

132
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,903
Dear God, don't be ridiculous.

133
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,697
We're scholars, not
treasure hunters.

134
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,951
Hamunaptra's a myth told by
ancient Arab storytellers

135
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,626
to amuse Greek and
Roman tourists.

136
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:14,083
I know all the blather about the city
being protected by the curse of a mummy,

137
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:18,920
but my research has led me to believe that
the city itself may have actually existed.

138
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:23,054
- Are we talking about the Hamunaptra?
- Yes. The City of the Dead.

139
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,390
Where the earliest pharaohs were said
to have hidden the wealth of Egypt?

140
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,688
Yes, yes, in a big,
underground treasure chamber.

141
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,692
- Heh! - Oh, come on.
- Everybody knows the story.

142
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,520
The entire necropolis was rigged to sink
into the sand on Pharaoh's command?

143
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,607
A flick of a switch, and the whole place
would disappear beneath the sand dunes,

144
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,941
taking the treasure with it?

145
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,948
As the Americans would say,
it's all fairy tales and hokum.

146
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,451
Oh, my goodness! Look at that!

147
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,585
You'be burnt it! You've burned
off the part with the lost city?

148
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,921
It's for the best, I'm sure.

149
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,259
Many men have wasted their lives in
the foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra.

150
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,432
No one's ever found it.

151
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,097
Most have never returned.

152
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,062
Come, come! Step
over the threshold.

153
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,811
Welcome to Cairo Prison,
my humble home.

154
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,735
You told me that you got it
on a dig down in Thebes.

155
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,482
- Yeah, well, I was mistaken.
- You lied to me.

156
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,814
I lie to everybody. What
makes you so special?

157
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,991
- I am your sister. - That
just makes you more gullible.

158
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,943
You stole it from a drunk
at the local casbah?

159
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,598
Picked his pocket, actually, so I
don't think it's a very good...

160
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,741
Stop being so ridiculous. What
exactly is this man in prison for?

161
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,575
This I did not know.

162
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,458
But when I heard that you were
coming, I asked him that myself.

163
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,164
And what did he say?

164
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,716
He said he was just
looking for a good time.

165
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,016
- This is the man that you
stole it from? - Yes, exactly?

166
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,224
So why don't we just go sniff
out a spot of tiff in...

167
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,728
Who are you?

168
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,895
- And who's the broad?
- "Broad"?

169
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:59,194
I'm just a local sort of missionary
chap, spreading the good word,

170
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,148
- but this is my sister, Evy.
- How do you do?

171
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:06,494
- Oh, well. Guess she's not a
total loss. - I beg your pardon?

172
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,363
I'll be back in a moment?

173
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,790
- Ask him about the box.
- We have found...

174
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,709
Hello. Excuse me?

175
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,412
We both found your puzzle box,

176
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,918
and we've come to
ask you about it?

177
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,046
- No.
- No?

178
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:26,006
No. You came to ask
me about Hamunaptra.

179
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,433
How do you know the box
pertains to Hamunaptra?

180
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,978
Because that's where I was
when I found it. I was there.

181
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,649
But how do we know that's
not a load of pig's wallow?

182
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,734
- Do I know you?
- No, no.

183
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,187
I've just got one
of those faces.

184
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:49,161
You were actually at Hamunaptra?

185
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,573
- Yeah, I was there.
- You swear?

186
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,408
- Every damn day. - I
didn't mean that...

187
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:58,872
I know. I was there. SETI's
place. City of the Dead.

188
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,212
Could you tell me
how to get there?

189
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,804
I mean, the exact location?

190
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,591
- You want to know?
- Well, yes?

191
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,143
- Do you really want to know?
- Yes?

192
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,479
Then get me the
hell out of here!

193
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,196
Do it, lady!

194
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:31,162
- Where are they taking him?
- To be hanged?

195
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,282
Apparently, he had
a very good time?

196
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,290
I will give you £100 to
save this man's life.

197
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,797
Madame, I would pay £100
just to see him hang.

198
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,799
- £200.
- Proceed!

199
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,047
£300.

200
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,971
Any last requests, pig?

201
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,766
Yeah? Loosen the
knot and let me go.

202
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,145
Of course we don't let him go!

203
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,191
£500!

204
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,321
And what else? I'm
a very lonely man.

205
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:16,623
No!

206
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,924
His neck did not break.

207
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:31,680
Oh, I'm so sorry. Now, we must
watch him strangle to death.

208
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,146
He knows the location
to Hamunaptra.

209
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,149
- You lie.
- I would never!

210
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,445
Are you telling me this
filthy, godless son of a pig

211
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,651
- knows where to find the
City of the Dead? - Yes!

212
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,860
- Truly?
- Yes!

213
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:55,287
And if you cut him down,
we will give you...

214
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,330
- 10 %
- 50 %

215
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,036
- Twenty.
- Forty.

216
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,122
- Thirty!
- Twenty five.

217
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,623
Deal.

218
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,251
Cut him down!

219
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,232
GIZA PORT - CAIRO

220
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,439
Do you really think
he's going to show up?

221
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,987
Yes, undoubtedly,
knowing my luck.

222
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,400
He may be a cowboy, but I know
the breed. His word is his word.

223
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:37,158
Well, personally I think he's
filthy, rude, a complete scoundrel.

224
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,740
- I don't like him one bit.
- Anyone I know?

225
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,084
Oh.

226
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,789
Hello.

227
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,591
Smashing day for the start of
an adventure, eh, O'Connell?

228
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,669
Yeah. Yeah, smashing.

229
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:55,597
Oh, no, no, I'd never steal
from a partner, partner.

230
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,301
That reminds me? No hard
feelings about the...

231
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,604
- Oh, no, no. Happens all
the time. - Mr. O'Connell?

232
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,431
Can you look me in the
eye and guarantee me

233
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,359
this isn't some
sort of a flimflam?

234
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,813
- Because if it is, I am warning
you... - You're warning me?

235
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,656
Lady, let me put it this way,

236
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:15,200
my whole damn Garrison
believed in this so much

237
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,074
that without orders, they marched
halfway across Libya and into Egypt

238
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,165
to find that city.

239
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:23,083
When we got there, all we
found was sand and blood.

240
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,127
Let me get your bags.

241
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,089
Yes, yes, you're right.

242
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:36,806
Filthy, rude, a complete scoundrel.
Nothing to like there at all.

243
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,802
Bright good morning to all.

244
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,137
Oh, no. What are you doing here?

245
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:46,850
I'm here to protect my
investment, thank you very much.

246
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,502
Quit playing with your glasses
and cut the deck, Burns.

247
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:14,505
Without my glasses I can't see
the deck to cut it, Dave.

248
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,133
O'Connell, sit down. We
could use another player.

249
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,261
- I only gamble with my life,
never my money. - Never?

250
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:24,095
What if I was to bet you $500 we
get to Hamunaptra before you?

251
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,272
- You're looking for Hamunaptra?
- Damn straight we are.

252
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,600
- And who saya we are?
- He does.

253
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,444
Well... Well, how about it?

254
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,442
Is it a bet?

255
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,994
- All right, you're on. - What
makes you so confident, Sir?

256
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:43,330
- What makes you? - We got us a
man who's actually been there.

257
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,075
Oh, what a coincidence,
because O'Connell...

258
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,245
Whose play is it? Is it my play?
I thought...

259
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:52,752
Gentlemen, we got us a wager.
Good evening, Jonathan.

260
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,545
Night.

261
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,771
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

262
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,899
The only thing that scares me,
Mr. O'Connell, are your manners.

263
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:19,984
- Still angry about that kiss, huh?
- Well, if you call that a kiss.

264
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:30,211
Did I miss something? Are we...
Are we going into battle?

265
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,709
Lady, there's
something out there.

266
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,748
Something underneath that sand.

267
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:38,085
Yes, well, I'm hoping to
find a certain artifact.

268
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:41,339
A book, actually. My brother
thinks there's treasure.

269
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:46,014
- What do you think's out
there? - In a word? Evil.

270
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:49,847
The Bedouin and the Tuaregs believe
that Hamunaptra is cursed.

271
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:53,184
Oh, look, I don't believe in fairy
tales and hokum, Mr. O'Connell,

272
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,191
but I do believe one of the most famous
books in history is buried there.

273
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,738
The Book of Amun-Ra.

274
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:02,576
It contains within it all the secret
incantations of the old kingdom.

275
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:05,495
It's what first interested me
in Egypt when I was a child.

276
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:09,040
It's why I came here.
Sort of a life's pursuit.

277
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:13,375
And the fact that they say it's made out
of pure gold makes no never mind to you?

278
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:15,664
- Right. - You
know your history.

279
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,545
I know my treasure.

280
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,505
By the way,

281
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,970
why did you kiss me?

282
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,394
I was about to be hanged. It seemed
like a good idea at the time.

283
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,151
What? What'd I say?

284
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,365
Surprise! My good
friend, you're alive!

285
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:50,745
- I was so very, very worried. - Well,
if it ain't my little buddy, Beni.

286
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,747
- I think I'll kill you.
- Think of my children.

287
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,750
You don't have any children.

288
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,832
- Someday I might.
- Shut up!

289
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,258
So, you're the one who's
leading the Americans?

290
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,301
I might have known. So,
what's the scam, Beni?

291
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,802
You task them into the middle of the
desert, and then you leave them to rot?

292
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,599
Unfortunately, no.

293
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,844
These Americans are smart.

294
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,930
They pay me only half now, half
when I get them back to Cairo.

295
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:16,267
- So this time I must go all the
way. - Them's the breaks, huh?

296
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,274
You never believed in
Hamunaptra, O'Connell.

297
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,735
Why are you going back?

298
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,448
You see that girl?
She saved my neck.

299
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:35,703
You always did have
more balls than brains.

300
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,718
Yeah. Goodbye, Beni.

301
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,093
O'Connell!

302
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,319
George Bembridge...

303
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,448
In 1860...

304
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,124
1865, was...

305
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,207
Was...

306
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:22,211
Oh, for heaven's sake, girl, it
wasn't that good of a kiss, anyway.

307
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:38,189
Where is the map?

308
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,685
It's... It's... There.

309
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,692
And the key? Where is the key?

310
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,782
The key? The key? What key?

311
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,109
Evelyn!

312
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:07,048
The map! The map!
I forgot the map!

313
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:10,427
Relax. I'm the map?
It's all up here?

314
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,382
Oh, that's comforting.

315
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,063
- The key!
- Evy.

316
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,831
Hold on to this.

317
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:14,782
Can you swim?

318
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,535
Of course I can swim, if
the occasion calls for it.

319
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,867
Trust me. It calls for it.

320
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:46,735
O'Connell! O'Connell!
What are we going to do?

321
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:49,404
- Wait here! I'll go get help!
- Right!

322
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,341
Americans.

323
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,862
I say, bloody good show, chaps!

324
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:33,607
And did I panic?

325
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,533
I think not.

326
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,165
Get them out of the water!
Get them out of the water!

327
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,218
Come on, doggies! Give
them a smack, would you?

328
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,969
This is a messed-up country.

329
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,939
We've lost everything! All of
our tools, all the equipment!

330
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,311
All my clothes!

331
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,063
O'Connell!

332
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,395
Hey!

333
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,568
O'Connell!

334
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:17,617
It looks to me like I've
got all the horses!

335
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,444
Hey, Beni!

336
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:23,578
Looks to me like you're on
the wrong side of the river!

337
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,367
Yeah?

338
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,678
I only want four! Four!

339
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,355
I only want four, not
a whole bloody herd!

340
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:50,775
O'Connell! Can you
believe the cheek?

341
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,693
Just pay the man.

342
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,692
Oh, for heaven's sake.

343
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,820
Can't believe the price
of these fleabags?

344
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:01,369
Yes, happy? Very good.

345
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,538
You probably could've
got them for free.

346
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,412
- All we had to do was give
him your sister. - Yes.

347
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,203
Awfully tempting, wasn't it?

348
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,169
Awfully.

349
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,242
Never did like camels.

350
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:48,041
Filthy buggers. They smell,
they bite, they spit.

351
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,545
- Disgusting. - I think
they're adorable.

352
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:54,842
Oh, baby.

353
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,113
This one is strong.

354
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,954
Good morning, my friend.

355
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,228
What the hell we doing?

356
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,182
Patience, my good barat'm.
Patience.

357
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:21,987
Remember our bet, O'Connell? First
one to the city, 500 cash bucks.

358
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:24,572
A hundred of them bucks is yours
if you help us win that bet.

359
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,274
Oh, my pleasure.

360
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,991
Hey, O'Connell. Nice camel.

361
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,034
Get ready for it.

362
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,833
- For what? - We're about
to be shown the way.

363
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:57,393
- Will you look at that?
- Can you believe it?

364
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,099
Hamunaptra.

365
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,684
Here we go again.

366
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:36,724
So long, Beni!

367
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,724
That serves you right.

368
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,965
Go, Evy! Go!

369
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,050
Do they know something we don't?

370
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:57,217
They are led by a woman.
What does a woman know?

371
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,681
That's a statue of Anubis.

372
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,596
It's legs go deep underground.

373
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:05,650
According to Bembridge scholars, that's
where we'll find a secret compartment

374
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,898
containing the Golden
Book of Amun-Ra.

375
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,570
Jonathan, you're meant to
catch the sun with that.

376
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:19,159
- So, what are these old mirrors
for? - Ancient mirrors.

377
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,458
It's an ancient Egyptian trick.
You'll see.

378
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,627
Here, this for you.

379
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,959
Go ahead. It's something I borrowed
off our American brethren.

380
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:34,592
I thought you might like it, you
might need it for when you're...

381
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,924
Yeah? What are you looking at?

382
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:51,025
Hey, look for bugs. I hate bugs.

383
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,277
Do you realize we're
standing inside a room

384
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,610
no one has entered
in over 3,000 years?

385
00:40:57,664 --> 00:41:00,030
What is that God-awful stench?

386
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:13,426
And then there was light?

387
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,380
Hey, that is a neat trick.

388
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,341
- Oh, my God. It's a
sah-netjer. - What?

389
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,848
- A preparation room.
- Preparation for what?

390
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:25,055
For entering the afterlife.

391
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,309
Mummies, my good son. This is
where they made the mummies.

392
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:41,825
What the...

393
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,456
What was that?

394
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:50,380
Sounds like bugs.

395
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:55,047
- He said bugs? - What do you
mean, bugs? I hate bugs!

396
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,066
The legs of Anubis.

397
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,067
The secret compartment should be
hidden somewhere inside here.

398
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:46,765
You scared the bejesus
out of us, O'Connell.

399
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:48,141
Likewise.

400
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,395
- Hey, that's my tool Kit.
- No, I don't think so.

401
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:54,444
Okay? Perhaps I was mistaken.

402
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,443
Have a nice day, gentlemen.

403
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,489
We have a lot of work to
be getting along with.

404
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,910
- Push off! This is our dig
site? - We got here first.

405
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,248
This here's our statue, friend.

406
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:10,077
I don't see your name
written on it, pal.

407
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:13,416
Yes, well, there's
only four of you

408
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,749
and 15 of me.

409
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,300
Your odds are not so
great, O'Connell.

410
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,338
- I've had worse.
- Yeah, me, too.

411
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:26,559
Oh, look, for goodness' sake,
let's be nice, children.

412
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:30,689
If we're going to play together,
we must learn to share.

413
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:35,188
There are other places to dig.

414
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:43,238
According to these hieroglyphics,
we're underneath the statue.

415
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,115
We should come up right
between his legs.

416
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,117
When those damn Yanks
go to sleep...

417
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,744
- No offense.
- None taken.

418
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:50,245
We'll dig our way up
and steal that book

419
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,376
right out from under them?

420
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,786
Are you sure we can find
this secret compartment?

421
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,748
Oh, yes, if those beastly Americans
haven't beaten us to it.

422
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:58,504
- No offense.
- None taken.

423
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,710
Where'd our smelly
little friend get to?

424
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,234
Hey.

425
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,657
What have we here?

426
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:28,913
Blue gold.

427
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:33,914
This will fetch a
mighty fine price.

428
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,348
- Let's get us some treasure!
- Careful!

429
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,181
SETI was no fool.

430
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:54,980
I think perhaps we should
let the diggers open it.

431
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,068
Oh, I think we should listen
to the good doctor, Henderson.

432
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,855
Yeah, sure. Let them open it.

433
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:26,554
Let me get this straight.

434
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:29,053
They ripped out your guts
and stuffed them in jars?

435
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:32,727
They'd take out your heart as well. You
know how they took out your brains?

436
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,428
I don't think we
need to know this.

437
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:38,061
They'd take a sharp, red-hot
poker, stick it up your nose,

438
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,736
scramble things asbout a bit, and then
rip it all out through your nostrils.

439
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,154
- That's gotta hurt. - It's
called mummification.

440
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,324
- You'll be dead when they
do this. - For the record,

441
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,447
if I don't make it out of here, don't
put me down for mummification.

442
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:50,823
Likewise.

443
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,838
Oh, my God. It's a...

444
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,463
It's a sarcophagus.

445
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,513
Buried at the base of Anubis.

446
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,556
He must have been someone
of great importance.

447
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,689
Or he did something
very naughty.

448
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:23,186
Oh, Allah.

449
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,778
One more.

450
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:32,991
One more.

451
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,385
Help me! Help me!

452
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,716
Help me!

453
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,944
Well, who is it?

454
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:17,581
"He That Shall Not Be Named."

455
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,167
This looks like some
sort of a lock.

456
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,340
Well, whoever's in here
sure wasn't getting out.

457
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:28,042
Yeah, no kidding.

458
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:31,129
It'd take us a month to crack
into this thing without a key.

459
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,429
A key?

460
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:36,179
A key! A key! That's what
he was talking about!

461
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,932
- Who?
- The man on the barge,

462
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:40,934
the one with the hook. He
was looking for a key.

463
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:42,686
Hey, that's mine.

464
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:10,839
- What do you suppose killed
him? - Did you ever see him eat?

465
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:14,798
Seems that our American friends had a
little misfortune of their own today.

466
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:18,680
Three of their
diggers were melted.

467
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,636
- What?
- How?

468
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,221
Salt acid.

469
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:27,314
Pressurized salt acid. Some
kind of ancient booby trap.

470
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,696
Maybe this place
really is cursed.

471
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,402
Oh, for goodness' sake, you two!

472
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,787
- You don't believe in curses?
- No, I don't.

473
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:42,992
I believe if I can see it and I can touch
it, it's real. That's what I believe.

474
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,377
I believe in being prepared.

475
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:48,672
Let's see what our friend
the warden believed in.

476
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:56,885
- What?
- My God, what is it?

477
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,425
A broken bottle.

478
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,306
Glenlivet, 12 years old!

479
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:06,645
He may have been as stinky
fellow, but he had good taste.

480
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,067
Take this. Stay here.

481
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:15,028
- No, wait, wait! Wait
for me. Wait! - Evy!

482
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,282
Excuse me, but didn't the
man just say stay here?

483
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,407
Evy!

484
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:25,413
Mr. Henderson! Wake up!

485
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,416
O'Connell!

486
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:26,940
Enough!

487
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:31,768
We will shed no more
blood, but you must leave?

488
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:34,604
Leave this place or die.

489
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:37,319
You have one day.

490
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,306
Evelyn.

491
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:05,725
Hey.

492
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:10,518
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

493
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,808
- You sure?
- Thank you.

494
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:16,816
That proves it. Old SETI's fortune's
got to be under this sand.

495
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:19,983
For them to protect it like this, you
know there's treasure down there.

496
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:23,990
No, these men are desert people.
They value water, not gold.

497
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:28,624
You know, maybe just at night,
we could combine forces.

498
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,079
Hey, tough stuff,
try a right hook.

499
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,710
Ball up your fist and put it...
Put it up like that.

500
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,750
And then mean it.
Hit it right here.

501
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:40,052
- Mean it!
- Okay.

502
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:45,348
Okay, it's time for
another drink.

503
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:48,014
Unlike my brother, Sir,

504
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:51,188
I know when to say no.

505
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,768
And unlike your brother, miss,

506
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,728
you, I just don't get.

507
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,567
I know. You're wondering

508
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:07,871
what is a place like me
doing in a girl like this.

509
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:12,163
- Yeah, something like that.
- Egypt is in my blood.

510
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:13,953
You see,

511
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:18,633
my father was a very,
very famous explorer.

512
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,085
And he loved Egypt so much,

513
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:24,721
he married my mother,
who was an Egyptian

514
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:27,721
and quite an adventurer herself?

515
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:32,892
I get your father and I
get your mother, and...

516
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,566
I get him, but...

517
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:39,604
What are you doing here?

518
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:45,234
Look, I may not be an explorer

519
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:49,952
or an adventurer or
a treasure seeker

520
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:53,250
or a gunfighter, Mr. O'Connell,

521
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:58,626
but I am proud of what I am.

522
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,087
And what is that?

523
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,258
I...

524
00:53:04,473 --> 00:53:06,429
am a librarian.

525
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,596
And I am going to kiss you,

526
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,265
- Mr. O'Connell.
- Call me Rick.

527
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:24,110
Rick.

528
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,229
- There is a curse upon this
chest. - Curse, my ass.

529
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,065
- Who cares? - Have a
care, Mr. Henderson.

530
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,243
In these hallowed grounds, that which
was set forth in ancient times

531
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,786
- is as strong today as it
was then. - We understand.

532
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:13,830
What's it say?

533
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:23,590
"Death will come on swift wings"

534
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,464
"to whomsoever
opens this chest."

535
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,769
We should not be here.

536
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:42,150
This is not good.

537
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,602
It says,

538
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,608
"There is one, the undead,"

539
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:49,692
"who, if brought back to life,
is bound by sacred law"

540
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,743
"to consummate this curse."

541
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,663
Let's make sure we don't bring
anyone back from the dead then.

542
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,708
"He will kill all who
open this chest"

543
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:00,954
"and assimilate their
organs and fluids,"

544
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,961
"and in so doing,
he will regenerate"

545
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,509
"and no longer be the undead,"

546
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:10,546
"but a plague upon this Earth."

547
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:15,639
Well, we didn't come all
this way for nothing.

548
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,970
- That's right.
- It's the curse.

549
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,809
It's the curse.

550
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:23,688
It's the curse!
Beware of the curse!

551
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:25,315
Beware!

552
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:28,147
Stupid superstitious bastard.

553
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:33,159
Oh, I've dreamt about this
since I was a little girl.

554
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:34,657
You dream about dead guys?

555
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,831
Look, the sacred spells
have been chiseled off.

556
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:41,327
This man must have been condemned not
only in this life, but in the next.

557
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,582
- Tough break. - Yeah,
I'm all tears.

558
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:47,087
Now, let's see who's
inside, shall we?

559
00:55:57,688 --> 00:56:00,350
Oh, my God, I hate it when
these things do that.

560
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,896
Is he supposed to
look like that?

561
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:04,396
No, I've never seen a mummy
look like this before.

562
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:07,228
He's still... Still...

563
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,357
- Juicy.
- Juicy.

564
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,688
Yes.

565
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,741
He must be more than
3,000 years old,

566
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:15,410
and, well, it looks
as if he's still

567
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:17,370
decomposing.

568
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,786
Hey, look at that.

569
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:26,251
- What do you make of this? - My
God, these marks were made with...

570
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,132
Fingernails.

571
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:32,295
This man was buried alive.

572
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,260
And he left a message.

573
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:40,643
"Death is only the beginning?"

574
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,031
Oh, my God.

575
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,826
It does exist.

576
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,754
- The Book of the Dead.
- A book?

577
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,957
Who cares about a book? Where
the hell's the treasure?

578
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:11,667
This, gentlemen.

579
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:15,049
This is treasure.

580
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:19,349
Hell, I wouldn't trade
you for a brass...

581
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,646
Look at that.

582
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:27,266
There's your
treasure, gentlemen.

583
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,352
Now, we're on to something.

584
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:48,204
I believe you need a
key to open that book.

585
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:51,457
Say, O'Connell,

586
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,963
what do you think these
babies'll fetch back home?

587
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:58,172
We hear you boys found yourselves a
nice, gooey mummy. Congratulations.

588
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:02,600
If you dry that fellow out, you might
be able to sell him for firewood.

589
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,227
Look what I found.

590
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,895
You're in her seat.

591
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,189
- Now!
- Yup.

592
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:10,312
Scarab skeletons, flesh-eaters.

593
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:13,145
I found them inside
our friend's coffin.

594
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:17,279
They can stay alive for years
feasting on the flesh of a corpse.

595
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:21,738
Unfortunately for our friend, he was still
alive when they started eating him.

596
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,993
So somebody threw these
in with our guy,

597
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:26,200
and then they slowly
ate him alive?

598
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,875
Very slowly.

599
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:30,644
He certainly wasn't as popular fellow
when they planted him, was he?

600
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:34,963
Well, he probably got a little too
frisky with the pharaoh's daughter.

601
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:37,219
Well, according to my readings,

602
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:42,015
our friend suffered the Hom-Dai, the
worst of all Ancient Egyptian curses,

603
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:44,718
one reserved only for the
most evil of blasphemers.

604
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:48,180
In my research, I've never heard of this
curse having actually been performed.

605
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:50,687
- That bad, huh?
- Yes, well, they...

606
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,610
They never used it because
they feared it so.

607
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:58,191
It's written that if a victim of
the Hom-Dai should ever arise,

608
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:01,618
he would bring with him
the 10 plagues of Egypt.

609
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,567
That's called
stealing, you know?

610
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:38,397
According to you and my
brother, it's called borrowing.

611
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:43,906
I thought the Book of Amun-Ra
was made out of gold?

612
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:47,952
It is made out of gold. This
isn't the Book of Amun-Ra.

613
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:50,204
This is something else.

614
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:53,204
I think this may be
the Book of the Dead.

615
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,254
The Book of the Dead?

616
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:57,674
Are you sure you're meant to be
playing around with this thing?

617
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,592
It's just a book.

618
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:03,506
No harm ever came
from reading a book.

619
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:11,601
That happens a lot around here.

620
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:15,434
So, what's it say?

621
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:18,646
"Amun Ra. Amun Dei."

622
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:22,198
It speaks of the night
and of the day.

623
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:40,133
No! You must not
read from the book!

624
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,111
Run!

625
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,245
Go, go!

626
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:22,926
What have we done?

627
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:27,927
- Where the hell did they come from?
- I ain't waiting around to find out.

628
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,641
My glasses. My glasses!

629
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:35,848
Leave me! Leave me!

630
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,432
Hey! Hey!

631
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:40,693
Could you help me find my gl...

632
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:46,074
Wait for me!

633
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:10,553
Who's there?

634
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,348
Who's there?

635
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:30,110
Daniels?

636
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:55,552
Oh, Jon!

637
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:03,313
Scarabs!

638
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,567
Run, Evy! Go, go, go! Run!

639
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:39,763
- Evelyn?
- Evy?

640
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:42,474
- Evelyn?
- Evy!

641
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:57,989
Oh, Mr. Burns. Thank goodness.

642
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,166
I was just starting
to get scared.

643
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,084
I've lost everyone.

644
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,297
My eyes. My eyes...

645
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:29,528
Please help me.

646
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:34,363
My tongue. He took my tongue.

647
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:36,035
Please don't leave me.

648
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:41,033
Anck-Su-Namun.

649
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:43,201
Damn it! It's a trap door.

650
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:45,958
There's gotta be a switch or
something around here someplace.

651
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:50,300
- Run, you sons of
bitches! Run! - Go.

652
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,473
Go! Go!

653
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:15,866
Come with me my
Princess Anck-Su-namum.

654
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:18,990
There you are! Will you
quit playing hide-and-seek?

655
01:05:19,082 --> 01:05:21,038
Come on. Let's get out of here.

656
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:23,954
Evy!

657
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:37,596
- Move!
- Yeah, right.

658
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:40,892
Did you see that? It was
walking. It was walking!

659
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,899
I told you to leave or die.

660
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:54,819
You refused.

661
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,945
Now, you may have killed us all,

662
01:05:57,036 --> 01:06:00,244
for you have unleashed a creasture we
have feared for more than 3,000 years.

663
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:03,789
- Relax. I got him. - No mortal
weapon can kill this creature.

664
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:05,868
He's not of this world.

665
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,302
- You bastard. - What
did you do to him?

666
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:20,473
We saved him. Saved him before the
creature could finish his work.

667
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:24,177
Leave, all of you, quickly,
before he finishes you all.

668
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:30,983
I must now go on the hunt, and
try and find a way to kill him.

669
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,356
I already told you, I got him.

670
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:37,319
Know this,

671
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:40,493
this creature is the
bringer of death.

672
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:45,199
He will never eat, he will never
sleep, and he will never stop.

673
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:21,947
May the good Lord protect
and watch over me

674
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,529
as a Shepherd watches
over his flock.

675
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:40,379
No. Okay.

676
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:01,324
The language of the slaves...

677
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:06,321
I may have use for you.

678
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:10,041
And the rewards...

679
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:13,499
will be great.

680
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,877
My Prince.

681
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:23,843
Where are the other
sacred jars...

682
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:44,359
FORT BRYDON - CAIRO

683
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:53,964
I thought you said you didn't believe
in that fairy tales and hokum stuff.

684
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:58,791
Having an encounter with a
3,000-year-old walking, talking corpse

685
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:00,216
does tend to convert one.

686
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:03,636
Forget it. We're out the door,
down the hall, and we're gone.

687
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:06,806
- Oh, no, we are not.
- Oh, yes, we are.

688
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:09,635
Oh, no, we are not. We woke him
up, and we are going to stop him.

689
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:11,811
We? What we? We didn't
read that book.

690
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:14,560
I told you not to play around with
that thing. Didn't I tell you?

691
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:17,814
Yes, right then, me, me, me, me. I, I, I
woke him up and I intend to stop him.

692
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,314
Yeah? How?

693
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:22,021
You heard the man. No mortal
weapons can kill this guy.

694
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:25,324
Then we are just going to have
to find some immortal ones.

695
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:26,867
There goes that we again.

696
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:29,320
Look, will you listen to me?
We have to do something.

697
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:32,031
Once this creature has been reborn,
his curse is going to spread

698
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:33,662
until the whole of the
Earth is destroyed.

699
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:36,745
- Yeah? Is that my problem?
- Lt is everybody's problem.

700
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,125
Evelyn, I appreciate you
saving my life and all,

701
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:42,505
but when I signed on, I agreed to take
you out there and to bring you back.

702
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:45,928
I have done that? End of job. End
of story. Contract terminated.

703
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,221
That's all I am to you?
A contract?

704
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:52,177
You can either tag along with me or you
can stay here and try and save the world.

705
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,895
- What's it gonna be?
- I'm staying.

706
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:58,099
- Fine.
- Fine.

707
01:09:58,277 --> 01:09:59,483
Fine.

708
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:09,744
I'm the last of the Royal Air Corps
still stationed out here, you know...

709
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:12,830
Some bloody idiot
spilt his drink.

710
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:17,085
All the other laddies died in the
sky and were buried in the sand.

711
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:19,662
Good chaps, every
one of them, too.

712
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:22,582
- Hi, Winston.
- Yeah...

713
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:26,340
You know, O'Connell, ever since
the end of the great war,

714
01:10:26,431 --> 01:10:31,346
there hasn't been a single
challenge worthy of a man like me.

715
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:34,101
Yeah? We all got our little
problems today, Winston.

716
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:37,646
I just wish I could have
chucked it in with the others

717
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:39,895
and gone down in
flame and Glory,

718
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:42,398
instead of sitting
around here, rotting

719
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,069
- of boredom and booze.
- Of boredom and booze.

720
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:45,647
Cheers.

721
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,610
Oh, well, back to the airfield.

722
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:55,080
- Tell me, has your sister always
been... - Oh, yes, always.

723
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:58,160
We're all packed up, but the damn boat
doesn't leave till tomorrow morning.

724
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,586
Tail set firmly between
your legs, I see.

725
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:04,632
You can talk. You don't have some
sacred walking corpse after you.

726
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,960
So, how's your friend?

727
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:12,424
He had his eyes and his tongue
ripped out. How would you be?

728
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:17,683
I'm so pleased to meet you.

729
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:21,349
Prince Imhotep does not
like to be touched.

730
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:25,232
A silly Eastern
superstition, I'm afraid.

731
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:26,813
Please forgive me.

732
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:36,619
Mr. Burns, Prince Imhotep thanks
you for your hospitality.

733
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:37,994
No.

734
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:40,539
And for your eyes,

735
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:44,289
- and for your tongue.
- Wha...

736
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:47,716
- But I am afraid more
is needed. - Wha...

737
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:50,253
The Prince must finish the job

738
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:52,088
and consummate the curse,

739
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:54,048
- which you and your friends...
- No!

740
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:57,761
- ...have brought down upon
yourselves. - No! Wait! No!

741
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,308
Good luck, boys.

742
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:09,438
Sweet Jesus!

743
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,903
Tasted just like...

744
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,277
Blood.

745
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:19,787
"And the rivers and waters of
Egypt ran red and were as blood."

746
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:23,578
He's here.

747
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:30,005
Oh, looks like it's gonna storm.

748
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:33,133
- Oh, Evelyn! - Oh,
so you're still here.

749
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:35,761
We've got problems.

750
01:12:58,291 --> 01:12:59,531
Hey!

751
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:03,205
Beni, you little stinkweed.
Where you been?

752
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,486
We are in serious trouble.

753
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,164
You saved me from the undead.

754
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,419
I thank you.

755
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:11,193
We are in very serious trouble.

756
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:15,313
- He does seem to like you Evy.
- Yeah, what's that about?

757
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:16,574
What's this guy want?

758
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:19,744
There's only one person that
can give us any answers.

759
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:22,363
- You!
- Miss Carnahan.

760
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:25,659
- Gentlemen. - What
is he doing here?

761
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:29,625
Do you really want to know, or
would you prefer to just shoot us?

762
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:33,708
After what I just saw, I'm willing
to go on a little faith here.

763
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:36,385
We are part of an
ancient secret society.

764
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:40,181
For over 3,000 yeasrs, we have
guarded the City of the Dead.

765
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:44,556
We are sworn at manhood to do any and all
in our part to stop the High Priest Imhotep

766
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:46,137
from being reborn
into this world.

767
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:47,813
Because of you, we have failed.

768
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,482
You think this justifies the
killing of innocent people.

769
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:52,480
To stop this creature?
Let me think.

770
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:53,902
- Yes!
- Yes!

771
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:58,275
Question. Why doesn't
he like cats?

772
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:00,280
Cats are the guardians
of the underworld.

773
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:02,251
He will fear them until
he is fully regenerated?

774
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:03,529
Then he will fear nothing.

775
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:05,504
You know how he gets his
self fully regenerated?

776
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:09,623
- By killing everyone who opened
that chest. - And sucking them dry!

777
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:12,121
Jonathan, will you stop
playing with that.

778
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:17,006
When I saw him alive at Hamunaptra,
he called me Anck-Su-Namun.

779
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:22,048
And then juat now in Mr. Burns'
quarters, he tried to kiss me.

780
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:25,055
It's because of his love for
Anck-Su-Namun that he was cursed.

781
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:28,058
- Apparently, even after 3,000 years...
- He is still in love with her.

782
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:30,686
Yes, that is very romantic, but
what has it got to do with me?

783
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:33,057
Perhaps he will once again try
to raise her from the dead.

784
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:34,147
Yes.

785
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:37,401
And it appears he has already
chosen his human sacrifice.

786
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:42,117
Bad luck, old mum.

787
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,865
On the contrary,

788
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:47,619
it may just give us the time
we need to kill the creature.

789
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:50,326
We will need all the
help we can get.

790
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:52,999
His powers are growing.

791
01:15:57,803 --> 01:16:01,466
"And he stretched forth his
hand towards the heavens"

792
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:05,391
"and there was darkness
throughout the land of Egypt."

793
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:07,885
We must stop him
from regenerating.

794
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,060
Who opened that chest?

795
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:10,684
There was me and Daniels here.

796
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:13,107
- And Burns, of course. - And
that Egyptologist fellow.

797
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:14,354
What about my buddy, Beni?

798
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:16,686
No, he scrammed out of there
before we opened the thing.

799
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:19,739
- Yeah, he was the smart one.
- Yeah, that sounds like Beni.

800
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:23,192
We must find the Egyptologist and bring
him back to the safety of the fort

801
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:25,448
- before the creature can
get to him. - Right.

802
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:27,140
She stays here. You
three, come with me.

803
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:29,073
- Not me...
- No, no!

804
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:33,081
Just a minute! You can't leave me
behind like some old carpetbag.

805
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:36,505
Who put you in charge, O'Connell?
What do you think you are doing?

806
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,128
Jonathan! O'Connell!

807
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:41,006
- Sorry, but he's a bit tall.
- Jonathan, coward that you are...

808
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:43,554
O'Connell, you are not
leaving me in here!

809
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,967
Jonathan, if you don't open
this door in one minute flat...

810
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:49,017
- O'Connell... - This
door doesn't open.

811
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:50,595
- Let me out of here.
- She doesn't come out,

812
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:52,645
- and no one goes in, right?
- Right.

813
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:54,394
- Right?
- Right.

814
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:56,646
O'Connell! Jonathan!

815
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:57,977
Let's go, Jonathan?

816
01:16:58,072 --> 01:17:01,189
Oh, I thought I could just astay
at the fort and reconnoiter.

817
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:02,568
- Now!
- Yeah, right.

818
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:05,117
We're just gonna rescue
the Egyptologist.

819
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:41,566
Well, well, well. Let me guess.
Spring cleaning?

820
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:47,109
Nice shot.

821
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:51,076
Oh, Beni, did you fall down?
Let me help you up.

822
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:57,044
You came back from the desert with
a new friend, didn't you, Beni?

823
01:17:57,131 --> 01:17:59,622
What friend? You are
my only friend.

824
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:05,845
What the hell are you doing with
this creep? What's in it for you?

825
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:09,924
It is better to be the right hand
of the devil than in his path.

826
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:13,261
As long as I serve
him, I am immune.

827
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:18,352
Immune from what?

828
01:18:19,862 --> 01:18:20,942
What did you say?

829
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:23,863
I don't wanna tell you. You'll
just hurt me some more.

830
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:26,816
What are you looking for?
And try not to lie to me.

831
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:28,534
The book!

832
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:31,784
The black book they found at
Hamunaptra. He wants it back.

833
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:34,035
He said to me it would be
worth it's weight in gold.

834
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:36,788
- What does he want the
book for? - I don't know.

835
01:18:37,296 --> 01:18:40,709
Something about bringing his
dead girlfriend back to life.

836
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:43,211
But that's all. He just
wants the book, I swear.

837
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:46,715
Just the book, I swear.
And your sister.

838
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:48,007
But other than that...

839
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:42,892
- That's two down, two to go.
- Then he'll be coming after Evy.

840
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:44,606
Guards in place!

841
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:46,233
Reporting all clear, Sir!

842
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:47,813
To hell with this?

843
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:50,320
I'm going downstairs, get me
a drink. You want something?

844
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:53,619
- Yeah. Yeah, get me a glass
of bourbon. - All right.

845
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,992
- And a shot of bourbon.
- Yeah, okay, okay.

846
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,620
- And as bourbon chasser.
- I'll get your damn bourbon!

847
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:00,872
Don't worry about the door.

848
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:42,303
Anck-Su-Namun.

849
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:55,984
Hey, get your ugly
face off of her!

850
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:01,326
Look what I got.

851
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:21,596
- You all right?
- Well, I'm not sure.

852
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:35,898
Well, according to legend, the black
book the Americans found at Hamunaptra

853
01:22:35,993 --> 01:22:38,029
is supposed to bring
people back from the dead.

854
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,240
Until now, it was a notion I
was unwilling to believe.

855
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:42,784
Believe it, sister. That's what
brought our buddy back to life?

856
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:46,242
Yes. I'm thinking that if the black
book can bring dead people to life...

857
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:49,999
- Then maybe the gold book can
kill him. - That's the myth.

858
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:52,957
Now, we just have to find out
where the gold book is hidden.

859
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:54,666
Imhotep.

860
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:56,634
Imhotep.

861
01:22:56,847 --> 01:22:58,553
Imhotep.

862
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:00,631
Imhotep.

863
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:02,929
Imhotep.

864
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:07,312
Imhotep.

865
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:13,482
Imhotep.

866
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:15,733
Imhotep.

867
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,406
Imhotep.

868
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:21,486
Last but not least, my favorite
plague, boils and sores.

869
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:23,571
They have become his slaves.

870
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:27,245
So it has begun, the
beginning of the end.

871
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:29,918
Not quite yet, it hasn't.
Come on.

872
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:32,754
Imhotep.

873
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:35,089
Imhotep.

874
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:36,755
Imhotep.

875
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:43,303
Imhotep.

876
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:45,759
Imhotep.

877
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:55,611
According to Bembridge scholars,
the Golden Book of Amun-Ra

878
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:57,688
is located inside the
statue of Anubis.

879
01:23:57,783 --> 01:23:59,774
- That's where we found the
black book. - Exactly.

880
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,733
Looks like the old boys at
Bembridge were mistaken.

881
01:24:01,828 --> 01:24:03,443
They mixed the books up.

882
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:05,325
Mixed up where they were buried.

883
01:24:05,415 --> 01:24:08,452
So, if the black book is
inside the statue of Anubis,

884
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:11,206
then the Golden book
must be inside...

885
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:19,885
- Come on, Evy, faster.
- Patience is a virtue.

886
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,426
Not right now, it isn't.

887
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:26,429
- I think I'll go and get the
car started. - I've got it.

888
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:30,729
The Golden Book of Amun-Ra is at
Hamunaptra inside the statue of Horus.

889
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:33,182
Take that, Bembridge scholars.

890
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:44,613
Imhotep.

891
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:47,829
Imhotep.

892
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,710
Imhotep.

893
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:55,121
Imhotep.

894
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:04,471
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

895
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:08,763
Get this thing in gear, boy.
Let's get out of here.

896
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:11,186
- Evy. Come on, Evy. Hurry up.
- Imhotep!

897
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:12,846
Imhotep!

898
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:22,356
You're gonna get yours, Beni!
You hear me?

899
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:27,365
- You're gonna get yours! - Oh,
like I've never heard that before!

900
01:25:57,736 --> 01:25:59,647
Hang on!

901
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:37,980
Hey! O'Connell! O'Connell!

902
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:34,658
Jump down!

903
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:39,500
Move, move, move!

904
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:44,046
Imhotep.

905
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:45,715
Imhotep.

906
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:47,672
Imhotep.

907
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:53,345
Imhotep.

908
01:27:53,852 --> 01:27:55,638
Imhotep.

909
01:27:58,607 --> 01:28:00,347
It's the creature.

910
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:02,773
He's fully regenerated.

911
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:10,194
Come with me, my Princess.

912
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:13,531
It is time to make
you mine forever.

913
01:28:13,747 --> 01:28:16,033
For all eternity, idiot.

914
01:28:22,172 --> 01:28:25,505
Take my hand, and I will
spare your friends.

915
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:28,128
Oh, dear.

916
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:33,137
- Have you got any bright ideas?
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

917
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:36,638
You better think of something fast,
because if he turns me into a mummy,

918
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:39,060
you're the first one
I'm coming after.

919
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:44,148
No.

920
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:45,271
- Don't.
- No!

921
01:28:45,362 --> 01:28:47,648
He has to take me to Hamunaptra
to perform the ritual.

922
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:51,357
She is right. Live
today, fight tomorrow.

923
01:29:02,879 --> 01:29:05,586
I'll be seeing you again.

924
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:13,052
Evelyn!

925
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:18,930
- Hey, that's mine.
- Thank you.

926
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:21,595
Kill them all!

927
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:23,897
No! Let go of me!

928
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:25,565
- Imhotep.
- Let go of me!

929
01:29:25,652 --> 01:29:28,610
- Goodbye, my friend.
- Come here, you little...

930
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:31,564
Imhotep.

931
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:33,781
Imhotep.

932
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:38,696
Come on!

933
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:40,790
- What about my sister?
- We're gonna get her back!

934
01:29:40,792 --> 01:29:42,498
Go!

935
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:43,951
You're next!

936
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:47,374
Come on! Give me your hand!

937
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:49,626
- You go!
- Come on!

938
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:50,958
Go!

939
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:26,660
Morning, Winston. A word?

940
01:30:28,173 --> 01:30:31,916
What's your little problem got to do
with His Majesty's Royal Air Corps?

941
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:33,546
Not a damn thing.

942
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:37,925
- Is it dasngerous? - You
probably won't live through it.

943
01:30:38,016 --> 01:30:39,927
By Jove, do you really think so?

944
01:30:40,018 --> 01:30:42,509
Everybody else we've bumped
into has died. Why not you?

945
01:30:42,604 --> 01:30:45,266
What's the... What's
the challenge, then?

946
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:49,020
Rescue the damsel in distress, kill
the bad guy, and save the world.

947
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:52,944
Winston Havlock at
your service, Sir.

948
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:06,200
Are you all right?

949
01:31:07,087 --> 01:31:09,544
Do I bloody look all right?

950
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:15,174
How you doing?

951
01:31:24,813 --> 01:31:28,431
See that? I've never
seen one so big.

952
01:31:29,067 --> 01:31:30,978
- Never?
- No!

953
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:46,907
Get off me! Get off!

954
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:50,535
I need a new job.

955
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:12,979
Oh, my God.

956
01:32:13,445 --> 01:32:14,855
We're back.

957
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:28,956
O'Connell.

958
01:32:41,514 --> 01:32:43,800
Oh, my God.

959
01:32:45,435 --> 01:32:49,394
Hey, Winston! Pedal faster!

960
01:32:51,608 --> 01:32:53,348
Hang on, men!

961
01:33:36,861 --> 01:33:39,068
Stop it! You'll kill them!

962
01:33:39,197 --> 01:33:40,858
That's the idea.

963
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:58,455
Here I come, laddies!

964
01:34:25,869 --> 01:34:29,236
I love the whole sand-wall
trick. It was beautiful.

965
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:30,570
Bastard.

966
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:49,256
Excuse me.

967
01:34:51,936 --> 01:34:56,646
A little help would be useful,
if it's not too much trouble!

968
01:34:58,151 --> 01:35:00,107
Yeah, yeah. All right.

969
01:35:05,658 --> 01:35:08,240
Winston! Hey, Winston!

970
01:35:22,759 --> 01:35:26,297
Quicksand! Get back!
It's quicksand?

971
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:15,596
Keep moving!

972
01:36:17,063 --> 01:36:21,432
Nasty little fellows such as yourself
always get their comeuppance.

973
01:36:22,151 --> 01:36:25,359
- Really? They do?
- Oh, yes.

974
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:27,862
Always?

975
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:37,204
I'd take those
bigger stones first.

976
01:36:37,667 --> 01:36:40,784
Take them from the top, otherwise
the whole thing will cave in on us.

977
01:36:40,878 --> 01:36:43,335
Come on. Put your backs into it.

978
01:36:44,882 --> 01:36:47,749
Yes, well, you've got the idea.
Chop, chop.

979
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:58,301
I say!

980
01:37:01,441 --> 01:37:04,558
Gents, you should come
and have a look at this.

981
01:37:12,368 --> 01:37:13,608
What?

982
01:37:14,037 --> 01:37:15,948
It's my arm! My arm!

983
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,206
- Do something!
- Hold it!

984
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:24,411
Do something! Do something!
Not that! Not that!

985
01:37:34,682 --> 01:37:36,218
O'Connell.

986
01:38:02,085 --> 01:38:04,952
Bembridge scholars never
wrote about this.

987
01:38:09,967 --> 01:38:12,379
Get off me. Get off!

988
01:38:13,971 --> 01:38:15,381
Kill them...

989
01:38:15,473 --> 01:38:18,840
and wake the others.

990
01:38:58,307 --> 01:39:00,593
Wha... Wha...

991
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:23,279
- Can you see...
- Yeah.

992
01:39:23,374 --> 01:39:25,706
- Can you believe...
- Yeah.

993
01:39:25,793 --> 01:39:27,533
- Can we just...
- No.

994
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:41,597
- Who the hell are these guys?
- Priests.

995
01:39:42,059 --> 01:39:43,549
Imhotep's priests.

996
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:45,514
All right, then.

997
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:34,934
There he is!

998
01:40:36,113 --> 01:40:38,069
Hello, Horus, old boy.

999
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:49,247
Time to close the door.

1000
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:31,206
Anck-Su-Namun.

1001
01:41:40,344 --> 01:41:41,800
O'Connell!

1002
01:41:42,555 --> 01:41:44,011
Jonathan!

1003
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:57,771
Damn. These guys just
don't quit, do they?

1004
01:41:57,903 --> 01:41:59,439
Keep digging.

1005
01:42:23,262 --> 01:42:24,877
The Book of Amun-Ra.

1006
01:42:33,314 --> 01:42:36,147
Save the girl.
Kill the creature.

1007
01:42:48,454 --> 01:42:52,743
What are you waiting for?
Get out! Get out!

1008
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:02,419
You all right. Let's go.

1009
01:43:52,643 --> 01:43:54,554
With your death,
Anck-Su-namun shall live.

1010
01:43:54,645 --> 01:43:57,136
And I shall be invincible!

1011
01:43:57,481 --> 01:44:01,224
The Book of Amun-Ra! I
found it, Evy! I found it!

1012
01:44:01,318 --> 01:44:02,933
The Book of Amun-Ra.

1013
01:44:03,028 --> 01:44:05,895
Shut up and get me
off here, Jonathan!

1014
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:09,824
Open the book, Jonathan. It's
the only way to kill him.

1015
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:12,697
You have to open the book
and find the inscription.

1016
01:44:12,788 --> 01:44:16,576
Well, I can't open it!
It's locked or something.

1017
01:44:18,335 --> 01:44:21,668
- We need the key, Evy!
- It's inside his robes.

1018
01:44:28,554 --> 01:44:29,794
O'Connell!

1019
01:45:01,670 --> 01:45:03,035
Mummies.

1020
01:45:14,517 --> 01:45:17,384
Look out! There's one there...
O'Connell!

1021
01:45:42,962 --> 01:45:45,044
Here's an inscription.

1022
01:46:04,108 --> 01:46:05,723
Oh, boy.

1023
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:16,067
Oh, yeah. This just keeps
getting better and better.

1024
01:46:16,745 --> 01:46:18,906
- Do something, Jonathan.
- Me?

1025
01:46:18,998 --> 01:46:21,956
- You can command them. - You
have got to be joking.

1026
01:46:22,042 --> 01:46:25,534
Finish the inscription on the cover,
idiot, then you can control them.

1027
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:27,460
Oh. Right.

1028
01:47:05,127 --> 01:47:06,992
Hurry up, Jonathan!

1029
01:47:38,869 --> 01:47:42,532
- I can't figure out this last
symbol. - What does it look like?

1030
01:47:56,637 --> 01:48:00,004
It's a bird. A stork!

1031
01:48:12,903 --> 01:48:14,734
Ahmenophus.

1032
01:48:16,448 --> 01:48:18,029
Oh, yes, I see.

1033
01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:52,435
Destroy him!

1034
01:48:53,902 --> 01:48:55,642
I command you to destroy him!

1035
01:49:03,912 --> 01:49:05,743
Anck-Su-Namun!

1036
01:49:10,252 --> 01:49:11,662
Give me that book!

1037
01:49:16,842 --> 01:49:18,423
Anck-Su-Namun!

1038
01:49:25,934 --> 01:49:27,765
Now you die.

1039
01:49:45,996 --> 01:49:48,362
Evy, I've got it.

1040
01:49:53,003 --> 01:49:54,493
Keep him busy.

1041
01:49:58,342 --> 01:49:59,832
No problem.

1042
01:50:12,231 --> 01:50:15,689
- Hurry, Evy! Hurry!
- You're not helping.

1043
01:50:18,695 --> 01:50:21,027
Now it's your turn.

1044
01:50:24,743 --> 01:50:26,279
Oh! I've got it?

1045
01:50:56,191 --> 01:50:59,354
I thought you said it
was gonna kill him!

1046
01:51:08,453 --> 01:51:09,909
He's mortal.

1047
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:48,282
Death is only the beginning.

1048
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:19,850
Time to go.

1049
01:52:30,535 --> 01:52:33,368
You've lost the book!
Jonathan, I can't believe...

1050
01:52:33,455 --> 01:52:34,945
- Hurry!
- Come on!

1051
01:53:03,443 --> 01:53:06,230
- Couldn't we just...
- No, Jonathan!

1052
01:53:12,536 --> 01:53:14,026
O'Connell!

1053
01:53:16,707 --> 01:53:19,915
- O'Connell! Wait!
- Come on, come on!

1054
01:53:20,168 --> 01:53:23,205
- Wait! Please! - Come
on, come on! Beni!

1055
01:53:25,048 --> 01:53:26,629
Goodbye, Beni.

1056
01:54:04,755 --> 01:54:05,915
Go away.

1057
01:54:38,705 --> 01:54:40,491
Look out, look out!

1058
01:55:27,462 --> 01:55:29,919
Thank you. Thank you very much?

1059
01:55:30,006 --> 01:55:33,840
You have earned the respect and
gratitude of me and my people?

1060
01:55:33,927 --> 01:55:36,634
Yes, well, it was nothing?

1061
01:55:36,721 --> 01:55:39,007
May Allah smile upon you always.

1062
01:55:41,059 --> 01:55:43,175
And yourself.

1063
01:55:49,276 --> 01:55:52,063
- Yes, anytime. - Stay
out of trouble.

1064
01:55:53,155 --> 01:55:55,897
He's just leaving us here?

1065
01:56:00,245 --> 01:56:04,033
Well, I guess we go home
empty-handed again.

1066
01:56:04,416 --> 01:56:06,202
I wouldn't say that.

1067
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:10,411
Oh, please!

1068
01:56:19,556 --> 01:56:22,298
How about you, darling? Would
you like a little kissy-wissy?
