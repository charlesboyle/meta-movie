1
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,685
<i>To the head bone</i>

2
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,331
<i>The head bone's connected
to the horn bone</i>

3
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,006
<i>The horn bone's right above
the wing bones</i>

4
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,325
- I scared you!
- No, you didn't.

5
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,369
Okay! Remember our field trip rules,
everyone.

6
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,171
No pushing, no biting,
and no fire breathing!

7
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,290
What did I just say?

8
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,891
Eighteen, nineteen...

9
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,167
Okay, we're missing one.
Who are we missing?

10
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,683
Oh, Mike Wazowski.

11
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,681
Thanks, Joe.

12
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,524
Good luck finishing
your crossword puzzle.

13
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,684
- Sorry, Michael. I didn't see you.
- That's okay.

14
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,366
When I was on the bus, I found a nickel!

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,125
I wish I had pockets.

16
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,250
Okay, everyone, partner up.
Get your field trip buddy.

17
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,609
Jeremy! You and me? Okay, no biggie.

18
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,731
Hailey? No? Pairing up with Claire?
Great choice. She's a good egg.

19
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,126
Russell.

20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,609
Mike? Wazowski?

21
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,726
We car-pool?

22
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,603
- We're cousins.
- Hey!

23
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,808
Okay. Good catching up.

24
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,770
Well, Michael, it looks like
it's you and me again.

25
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,204
Come on, Karen. We're falling behind.

26
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,970
Please don't call me Karen.

27
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,890
<i>Now, stay close together.</i>

28
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,965
We're entering a very dangerous area.

29
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,811
Welcome to the Scare Floor.

30
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,166
This is where
we collect the Scream Energy

31
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,163
to power our whole world.

32
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,449
And can anyone tell me
whose job it is to go get that scream?

33
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,842
- Scarers!
- That's right!

34
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,321
Now, which one of you can
give me the scariest roar?

35
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,646
Me, me, me!

36
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,401
Sir! Right here!
Little green guy, two o'clock!

37
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,050
No, it's like this.

38
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,485
Hey, guys, watch this one.

39
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,641
Hey, I got a really good...

40
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,920
Whoa.

41
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,011
Well, hey there, kids.
Are you on a tour with your school?

42
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,121
- Yeah!
- Yes.

43
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,205
We're here to learn about Scream
Energy and what it takes to be a Scarer.

44
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,445
Well, hey, you're in luck,
because I just happen to be a Scarer.

45
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,562
I learned everything
I know from my school,

46
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,370
Monsters University.

47
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,041
- Whoa. 
- It's the best Scaring School there is.

48
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,327
You wish! Fear Tech's the best.

49
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,361
Okay. You guys watch us and tell me
which school's the best. All right?

50
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,806
MU is.

51
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,171
Let's go, everybody!

52
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,890
<i>West coast coming online.</i>

53
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,610
<i>Scarers coming out.</i>

54
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,086
Oops. Stop right there.

55
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,084
Don't cross over that safety line.

56
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,811
Human children are extremely toxic.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,490
Look at that!

58
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,881
Whoa! Hey, guys, watch the eye! Ow!

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,365
Look at that! It's amazing!

60
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,680
I know!

61
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,241
Excuse me. Fellas.

62
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,767
How about we do
tallest in the back?

63
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,410
Look, he's going to do a real Scare!

64
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,366
- Cool. I want to be a Scarer.
- Yeah. Me, too.

65
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,686
Come on, guys. I want to see.

66
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,851
Out of the way, Wazowski.
You don't belong on a Scare Floor.

67
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,966
Brian! Do not step over the line.

68
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,884
Mrs. Graves,
Michael went over the line.

69
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,203
Michael!

70
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,924
See? I told you. He's fine.

71
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,288
Well, I thought I heard something.

72
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,521
What?

73
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,524
Are you okay?

74
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,688
You could have gotten hurt!

75
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,521
I don't understand
how this could happen!

76
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,683
That was real dangerous, kid.
I didn't even know you were in there.

77
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,728
Wow. I didn't even know
you were in there.

78
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,965
Not bad, kid.

79
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,282
Michael, what do you have
to say for yourself?

80
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,930
How do I become a Scarer?

81
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,684
Monsters University!
Anybody getting off?

82
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,762
Well, everyone,
I don't mean to get emotional,

83
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,366
but everything in my life
has led to this moment.

84
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,169
Let it not be
just the beginning of my dream

85
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,924
but the beginning of all of our dreams.

86
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,968
Gladys, promise me
you'll keep auditioning.

87
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,122
Marie, Mr. Right
is out there somewhere.

88
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,561
Phil, keep using the ointment
till that thing goes away.

89
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,366
I wish you all the best.
Thank you all so much!

90
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,848
I'm welling up with tears. Now, get off.

91
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,370
Hello. How are you doing?

92
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,324
Stroke! Stroke!

93
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,961
Come on, put all you have into it!

94
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,205
Stroke! Stroke!

95
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,525
Okay! First thing on my list,

96
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,167
get registered.

97
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,368
Hey there, freshman. I'm Jay the R.A.,

98
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,250
and I'm here to say
that registration is thataway!

99
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,164
- Okay, Jay.
- Have a great first day.

100
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,091
Hey, I'm Kay!
Here's your orientation packet.

101
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,361
Thanks, Kay.

102
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,331
You can drop your bags off here
and get your picture taken with Trey.

103
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,124
- Say hooray!
- Hooray!

104
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,046
I can't believe it.

105
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,250
I'm officially a college student!

106
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,084
Okay, everyone, I'm Fay,

107
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,642
and I'll be giving you your
orientation tour on this perfect day!

108
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,048
Here are the labs where students learn

109
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,327
to design and build the doors
to the Human World.

110
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,691
Looks like the professor is
about to test a door!

111
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,161
The MU cafeteria serves a full buffet,
three meals a day.

112
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,408
I personally believe we have
some of the best chefs in the world.

113
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,686
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

114
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,891
The campus offers
a wide variety of majors,

115
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,682
but the crown jewel of MU
is the Scaring School.

116
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,688
Welcome to the Debate Team.
We're happy to have you.

117
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,842
I disagree for the following reasons.

118
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,410
True happiness
is a theoretical construct...

119
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,281
Hey there! Keep your eye on the sky
at the Astronomy Club!

120
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,849
Hey, hey, hey!
Come join the lmprov Club.

121
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,161
You'll wish you were a...
Never... Always...

122
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,241
Ah, dang it!

123
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,167
MU's Greek Council.
We sponsor the annual Scare Games.

124
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,126
The Scare what now?

125
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,483
The Scare Games!
A super-intense Scaring competition!

126
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,484
They're crazy dangerous,
so anything could happen.

127
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,370
A bunch of guys went
to the hospital last year!

128
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,961
- You could totally die.
- And it's worth it.

129
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,005
You get a chance to prove
that you are the best!

130
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,961
Cool.

131
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,921
Wazowski, Room 319.

132
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,563
You know, your roommate
is a Scaring major, too.

133
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,481
"Hello, I'm your roommate."
Oh, that's too bland.

134
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,489
Don't force it. Just let it happen.

135
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,764
Your lifelong best friend
is right behind this door.

136
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,570
Hey there. I'm your roomie.

137
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,290
Name's Randy Boggs. Scaring major.

138
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,980
Mike Wazowski, Scaring major.

139
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,050
I can tell we're going to be
best chums, Mike.

140
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,323
Take whichever bed you want.
I wanted you to have first dibs.

141
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,965
You just disappeared.

142
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,488
Sorry. If I do that in Scaring class,
I'll be a joke.

143
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,245
No, it's totally great. You got to use it.

144
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,685
- Really?
- Yeah, but lose the glasses.

145
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,450
They give it away.

146
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,207
Okay!

147
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,210
Unpack. Check. Hang posters. Check.

148
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,726
Now I just need to ace my classes,
graduate with honors,

149
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,240
and become the greatest Scarer ever.

150
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,643
Boy, I wish I had your confidence, Mike.

151
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,324
Aren't you even a little nervous?

152
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,970
Actually, no.

153
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,202
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

154
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,840
I just can't wait to get started.

155
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,688
Oh, man! I can't be late on the first day!

156
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,521
Wow.

157
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,165
You got to be kidding me.

158
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,131
I'm so nervous!

159
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,565
Relax. It will be fine.

160
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,687
Good morning, students.

161
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,089
Welcome to Scaring 101.

162
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,085
I am Professor Knight.

163
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,802
Now I'm sure all of you
were the scariest monster in your town.

164
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,284
Well, bad news, kids.
You're in my town now,

165
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,681
and I do not scare easily.

166
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,324
Dean Hardscrabble.
This is a pleasant surprise.

167
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,761
She's a legend.

168
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,322
She broke the all-time Scare Record
with the scream in that very can!

169
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,364
I don't mean to interrupt.

170
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,010
I just thought I'd drop by

171
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,607
to see the terrifying faces
joining my program.

172
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,101
Well, I'm sure my students
would love to hear

173
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,929
a few words of inspiration.

174
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,603
Inspiration? Very well.

175
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,161
Scariness is the true measure
of a monster.

176
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,605
If you're not scary

177
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,962
what kind of a monster are you?

178
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,089
It's my job to make
great students greater,

179
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,241
not make mediocre students
less mediocre.

180
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,766
That is why at the end of the semester
there will be a final exam.

181
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,081
Fail that exam and you are
out of the Scaring program.

182
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,449
So, I should hope
you're all properly inspired.

183
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,165
All right. All right.

184
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,246
Who can tell me the properties
of an effective roar?

185
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,121
Yes?

186
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,888
There are actually five.

187
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,088
Those include the roar's resonance,

188
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,322
the duration of the roar, and the...

189
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,926
Whoops. Sorry.

190
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,844
I heard someone say "roar,"
so I just kind of went for it.

191
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,804
Oh, excuse me, sorry.

192
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,451
I didn't mean to scare you there.
Hey, how you doing?

193
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,409
Very impressive, Mister...

194
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,209
Sullivan. Jimmy Sullivan.

195
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,607
Sullivan.

196
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,762
Like Bill Sullivan, the Scarer?

197
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,610
Yeah. He's my dad.

198
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,849
He's a Sullivan!

199
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,324
I should have known.
I expect big things from you.

200
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,041
Well, you won't be disappointed.

201
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,443
I'm sorry. Should I keep going?

202
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,961
No, no. Mr. Sullivan's covered it.

203
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,122
Everyone take out
your Scaring textbooks

204
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,043
and open them to chapter one.

205
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,122
Hey, bub. Can I borrow a pencil?

206
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,804
I forgot all my stuff.

207
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,009
All right. Yes.
There we go. That will get it.

208
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,731
Yeah.

209
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,084
Come on, Mike. It's a fraternity

210
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,641
and sorority party. We have to go!

211
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,246
If we flunk that Scaring final,
we are done.

212
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,061
I'm not taking any chances.

213
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,445
You've got
the whole semester to study,

214
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,081
but this might be our only chance
to get in good with the cool kids.

215
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,889
That's why I made these cupcakes.

216
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,248
That could have been embarrassing.

217
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,403
When I'm a Scarer,
life will be a nonstop party.

218
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,206
Stay out of trouble, wild man.

219
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,527
Wild man.

220
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,641
What this...

221
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,963
Archie!

222
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,241
Hey! What are you...

223
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,845
Wait... You're shushing me?
Hey! Hey! You can't...

224
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,851
- Where did he go?
- He's dead meat.

225
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,002
- That guy's in big trouble.
- Yeah, he is.

226
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,563
Hey, guys! Over here!

227
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,371
Fear Tech dummies.

228
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,361
- Sorry about that, buddy.
- Why are you in my room?

229
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,601
Your room? This is my...

230
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,644
This is not my room.

231
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,846
Archie! Come here, boy.

232
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,967
Archie?

233
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,168
Archie the Scare Pig.
He's Fear Tech's mascot.

234
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,726
Why is it here?

235
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,007
I stole it. Going to take it to the RORs.

236
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,161
The what?

237
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,847
Roar Omega Roar.
The top fraternity on campus.

238
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,287
They only accept the highly elite.

239
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,040
Okay, I'll lift the bed, you grab the pig.

240
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,080
- Ready? One, two, three.
- What? No, no... What...

241
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,281
That's it. Don't let go.

242
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,606
Careful. He's a biter.

243
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,961
Whoa! Whoa, hey... Whoa!

244
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,487
<i>L</i> got him!

245
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,889
That was awesome!

246
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,930
What am I doing? James P. Sullivan.

247
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,490
Mike Wazowski.

248
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,411
Listen, it was quite delightful
meeting you

249
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,721
and whatever that is,

250
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,848
but if you don't mind,
I have to study my Scaring.

251
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,691
You don't need to study Scaring.
You just do it.

252
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,321
Really? I think there's
a little more to it than that.

253
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,170
But, hey, thanks for stopping by.

254
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,685
Let go of that!

255
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,486
"My hat!
'MY Pig!

256
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,845
Hey! Come here!

257
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,002
Hey!

258
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,201
Catch it!

259
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,361
Come back here!

260
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,566
Yeah!

261
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,369
Ride it to frat row!

262
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,331
<i>Tentacles and serpent's wings,
they...</i>

263
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,401
Hey!

264
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,123
Go, go, go!

265
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,201
Hey...

266
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,129
Come on! Hey!

267
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,447
Cupcake?

268
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,765
Got it!

269
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,601
Fear Tech's mascot! MU rules!

270
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,404
M-U! M-U! M-U!

271
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,482
Did you see him catch that pig?

272
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,688
You are Jaws Theta Chi material,
freshman.

273
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,921
Thanks. I don't know...

274
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,162
No, no, no. He's an Omega Howl guy.

275
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,686
- Back off. We saw him first.
- No way. We did!

276
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,127
I'll take it from here, gentlemen.

277
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,009
Johnny Worthington,
president of Roar Omega Roar.

278
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,766
What's your name, big blue?

279
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,803
Jimmy Sullivan. Friends call me Sulley.

280
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,401
This guy's a Sullivan?
Like the famous Sullivan?

281
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,130
I can't believe it! That is crazy!

282
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,770
- Chet, calm down.
- I'm sorry.

283
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,730
Sulley, any freshman with the guts
to pull off a stunt like that

284
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,247
has got "Future Scarer"
written all over him.

285
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,807
Hey, did you see me ride the pig?
That took guts.

286
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,407
Slow down, squirt.
This party is for Scare students only.

287
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,846
Sorry, killer,
but you might want to hang out

288
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,604
with someone a little more your speed.

289
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,489
They look fun!

290
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,082
Hey there. Want to join Oozma Kappa?

291
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,361
We have cake.

292
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,251
Go crazy.

293
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,368
Is that a joke?

294
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,125
Sulley, talk to your friend.

295
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,362
He's not really my friend, but sure.

296
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,681
You heard him.
This is a party for Scare students.

297
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,406
I am a Scare student.

298
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,563
I mean for Scare students who actually,

299
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,682
you know, have a chance.

300
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,365
Aw, snap!

301
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,207
My chances are just as good as yours.

302
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,169
You're not even
in the same league with me.

303
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,166
Just wait, hotshot.

304
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,527
I'm going to scare circles
around you this year.

305
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,722
Okay. I'd like to see that.

306
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,171
Don't worry. You will.

307
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,687
Ready position.

308
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,480
Common crouch.

309
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,690
I want to see matted fur
and yellow teeth. Basic snarl.

310
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,809
Show me some slobber.

311
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,048
Drool is a tool, kids. Use it.

312
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,087
Now here is a monster
who looks like a Scarer.

313
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,661
You want a hope of passing
this class, you better eat,

314
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,887
breathe, and sleep Scaring.

315
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,961
Yeah!

316
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,166
Give me another one.

317
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,601
- Fear of spiders.
- Arachnophobia.

318
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,001
- Fear of thunder.
- Keraunophobia.

319
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,042
- Fear of chopsticks!
- Consecotaleophobia.

320
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,961
What is this, kindergarten?
Give me a hard one.

321
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,050
Go Monsters U!
You know what to do!

322
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,086
The answer is C, fangs.

323
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,487
Well done, Mr. Wazowski.

324
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,490
- A bowl of spiders!
- Correct!

325
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,683
- A clown running in the dark!
- Right again.

326
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,843
Warts, boils, and moles, in that order.

327
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,365
Outstanding!

328
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,401
Ogre slump.

329
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,766
Zombie snarl.

330
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,008
Dominant silverback gorilla.

331
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,970
That is some remarkable
improvement, Michael.

332
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,322
One frightening face does not
a Scarer make, Mr. Sullivan.

333
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,284
A Tauntaun Grimace
with Extra Slobber.

334
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,880
- You got it!
- That's what I'm saying.

335
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,165
I am going to wipe the floor
with that little know-it-all.

336
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,810
Yes, you are, big blue.

337
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,850
Hey, wait. What are you guys...

338
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,605
It's just a precaution.

339
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,842
RORs are the best Scarers
on campus, Sullivan.

340
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,040
Can't have a member getting
shown up by a beach ball.

341
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,520
I am on a roll.

342
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,126
I'm going to destroy that guy.

343
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,523
Well, then you'll get this back
right away.

344
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,922
It's time to start delivering
on that Sullivan name.

345
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,411
Today's final will judge your ability
to assess a child's fear

346
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,650
and perform the appropriate Scare
in the Scare Simulator.

347
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,851
The Child Sensitivity Level
will be raised

348
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,844
from Bed-wetter to Heavy Sleeper,

349
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,526
so give it everything you've got.

350
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,409
Dean Hardscrabble is with us
this morning

351
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,242
to see who will be moving on
in the Scaring program

352
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,120
and who will not.

353
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,961
Let's get started.

354
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,925
I am a five-year-old girl
afraid of spiders and Santa Claus.

355
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,051
Which Scare do you use?

356
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,764
That's a Seasonal Creep and Crawl.

357
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,161
Demonstrate.

358
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,683
Results will be posted
outside my office. Next.

359
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,967
Focus.

360
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,129
Johnson, Crackle and Howl.
Yes!

361
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,405
Hey. Do you mind?

362
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,121
Don't mind at all.

363
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,484
Come on, Mike. Let's just move.

364
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,491
Stay out of my way.

365
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,928
Unlike you, I had to work hard
to get into the Scare program.

366
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,448
That's because you don't belong here.

367
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,331
That's what I thought.

368
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,800
I'm so sorry.

369
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,769
It was an accident.

370
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,209
What? This?

371
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,921
My one souvenir
from a lifetime of Scaring?

372
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,371
Accidents happen, don't they.

373
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,844
The important thing is no one got hurt.

374
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,208
You're taking this remarkably well.

375
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,962
Now, let's continue the exams.

376
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,128
Mr. Wazowski, I'm a five-year-old girl
on a farm in Kansas afraid of lightning.

377
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,885
Which Scare do you use?

378
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,764
Shouldn't I go up on the...

379
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,088
Which Scare do you use?

380
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,486
That is a Shadow Approach
with a Crackle Holler.

381
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,727
Demonstrate.

382
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,769
- Stop. Thank you.
- But I didn't get to...

383
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,285
I've seen enough.

384
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,846
I'm a seven-year-old boy...

385
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,881
I wasn't finished.

386
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,240
I don't need to know
any of that stuff to scare.

387
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,206
That "stuff" would've informed you

388
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,965
that this particular child
is afraid of snakes.

389
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,404
So a roar wouldn't make him scream,
it would make him cry,

390
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,370
alerting his parents,
exposing the monster world,

391
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,044
destroying life as we know it,

392
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,884
and of course we can't have that.

393
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,088
So I'm afraid I cannot
recommend that you continue

394
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,731
in the Scaring program. Good day.

395
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,928
Wait, what? But I'm a Sullivan.

396
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,684
Well then, I'm sure your family
will be very disappointed.

397
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,407
And, Mr. Wazowski,
what you lack is something

398
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,130
that cannot be taught.

399
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,130
You're not scary.

400
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,330
You will not be continuing
in the Scaring program.

401
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,206
Please. Let me try the simulator.
I'll surprise you.

402
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,726
Surprise me? I doubt that very much.

403
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,001
<i>Welcome back.</i>

404
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,846
<i>I hope everyone had a pleasant break.</i>

405
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,603
Some say that a career
as a scream-can designer is boring,

406
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:40,402
unchallenging, a waste
of a monster's potential.

407
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,169
Open your textbooks to chapter three.

408
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,210
We will now plunge into the rich history

409
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,721
of scream-can design.

410
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,880
Out of my way!

411
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,529
Coming through! Sorry.

412
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,445
<i>Welcome to this year's
Greek Scare Games kickoff.</i>

413
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,206
<i>The Scare Games! Yeah!</i>

414
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,362
<i>Okay, relax.</i>

415
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,525
<i>We have a special guest,
the founder of the games,</i>

416
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,841
<i>Dean Hardscrabble.</i>

417
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,921
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

418
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,288
<i>As a student, I created these games
as a friendly competition,</i>

419
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,962
<i>but be prepared.</i>

420
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,530
<i>To take home the trophy,</i>

421
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,968
<i>you must be the most fearsome
monsters on campus.</i>

422
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,126
<i>So good luck,
and may the best monsters win.</i>

423
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,486
<i>All right, everybody.</i>

424
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,600
<i>We're closing down sign-ups,
so we'll see you all...</i>

425
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,961
Wait!

426
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,206
I'm signing up!

427
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,611
What?

428
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,323
<i>You have to be
in a fraternity to compete.</i>

429
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,928
Behold the next winning fraternity
of the Scare Games,

430
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,728
the brothers, my brothers,
of Oozma Kappa!

431
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,845
Hi.

432
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,968
Mr. Wazowski, what are you doing?

433
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,661
You just said the winners are the most
fearsome monsters on campus.

434
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,126
If I win, it means
you kicked out the best Scarer

435
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,925
in the whole school.

436
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,081
That won't happen.

437
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,125
How about a little wager?

438
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,604
If I win, you let me back
in the Scaring program.

439
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,649
And what would that prove?

440
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,486
That you were wrong.

441
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,521
Very well.

442
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,766
If you win, I will let your entire team
into the Scare program.

443
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,967
But if you lose,

444
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,486
you will leave Monsters University.

445
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,725
Deal.

446
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,361
Now all you need to do is find
enough members to compete.

447
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,441
We need six guys, right?

448
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,521
<i>Sorry, chief.</i>

449
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,208
<i>We count bodies, not heads.
That dude counts as one.</i>

450
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,882
Anybody else want to join our team?
Anyone at all?

451
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,086
Excuse me. Sorry. I'm late.

452
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,561
- Can I squeeze by you?
- Randy!

453
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,449
Randy, thank goodness.
I need you on my team.

454
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,326
Sorry. I'm already on a team.

455
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,401
Boggs.

456
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,721
I'm finally in with the cool kids, Mike.

457
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,404
Don't blow this for me.

458
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,086
Do the thing.

459
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,324
Where did he go?

460
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,647
Please, anybody.

461
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,927
I need one more monster.
Just one more!

462
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,004
<i>Yeah, sorry. Doesn't look good.</i>

463
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,526
<i>We have to move on.
Your team doesn't qualify.</i>

464
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,931
Yes, it does!

465
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,368
The star player has just arrived.

466
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,446
No way! Someone else!
Please! Anyone else.

467
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,320
<i>We're shutting down sign-ups, okay?
Is he on your team or not?</i>

468
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,445
Come on! Let's go!

469
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,244
Fine! Yes, he's on my team.

470
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,487
Good luck.

471
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,446
All right, Wazowski, what's the plan?

472
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,563
This is a fraternity house?

473
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,406
Hey there, teammateys!
Come on aboard!

474
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,402
As the president of Oozma Kappa,

475
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,211
it is my honor to welcome you
to your new home.

476
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,802
We call this room "Party Central."

477
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,208
Technically, we haven't
actually had a party here yet.

478
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,647
But when we do, we'll be ready!

479
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,407
The hot cocoa train is coming through!

480
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,323
Next stop... You!

481
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,448
I would like to start us off first by...

482
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,848
So, you guys are Scaring majors?

483
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,250
We were! None of us lasted very long.

484
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,722
I guess we just weren't what
old Hardscrabble was looking for.

485
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,802
Don Carlton, mature student.

486
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,881
Thirty years in the textile industry

487
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,162
and then old dandy Don got downsized.

488
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,163
Figured I could throw myself
a pity party,

489
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,322
or go back to school
and learn the computers.

490
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,287
Hello. I'm Terry with a "Y".

491
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,330
And I'm Terri with an "I"!
I'm a dance major!

492
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,606
And I'm not.

493
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,603
Five, six, seven, eight!

494
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,081
Seven, eight, turn! And...
Why didn't you turn?

495
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,924
Because we never agreed to do this!

496
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,680
- You said this was going to be cool!
- No one said this was gonna be cool.

497
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,000
- Now I'm embarrassed.
- Now you're embarrassed?

498
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,445
Yes, because it's in front of people!

499
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,931
You should wake up embarrassed.

500
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,206
Hey, hey, hey!

501
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,444
I'm Art! New Age philosophy major.

502
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,761
Excited to live with you
and laugh with you,

503
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,125
and cry with you.

504
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,967
Thought you might like
to keep a dream journal.

505
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,440
Guess that leaves me.

506
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,965
My name's Scott Squibbles.

507
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,610
My friends call me Squishy.

508
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,842
I'm undeclared, unattached,

509
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,561
and unwelcome pretty much
everywhere but here.

510
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,281
Now that we've all been introduced,
as captain of our team...

511
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,011
So, basically, you guys have
no Scaring experience?

512
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,145
Not a lot! But now we've got you!

513
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,641
You're about the scariest fella
I've ever seen.

514
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,324
Even with them pink polka dots.

515
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,547
Ah, thanks.

516
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,969
Actually, I think I bring
the whole package.

517
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,365
Your hands are as big as my face!

518
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,886
He's like a mountain with fur!

519
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,328
Come on. I don't even work out.

520
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,848
Yeah, me neither.
I don't want to get too big.

521
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,644
We thought our dreams were over,
but Mike said if we win,

522
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,360
they're letting us
in the Scaring program.

523
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,369
We're going to be real Scarers!

524
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,329
- The best!
- You betcha!

525
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,050
Yeah! Right.

526
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,840
And here's what you've been
waiting for, fellas.

527
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,082
Your very own Oozma Kappa bedroom.

528
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,323
Great! We're sharing this room?

529
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,164
We'll let you guys get settled.

530
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,686
Anything you need,
you just give a big holler-oonie!

531
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,650
Okay, thanks, buddy.
Are you kidding me?

532
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,587
Look, they don't need to be good.
I'm going to carry the whole team.

533
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,728
Really? And who's going to carry you?

534
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,525
Hey, if you want to go back
to can design,

535
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,886
you know where the door is.

536
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,760
Great.

537
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,286
Guys?

538
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,611
Anybody home?

539
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,325
Hello?

540
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,167
Fellas?

541
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,888
Do you pledge your souls
to the Oozma Kappa brotherhood?

542
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,730
- Do you swear to keep secret...
- ...all that you learn here?

543
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,565
No matter how horrifying?

544
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,966
Hey!

545
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,203
Will you take the sacred oath of the...

546
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,288
- For crying out loud.
- Sweetie!

547
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,249
Turn the lights on
while you're down here!

548
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,810
You're going to ruin your eyes!

549
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,811
Mom! We're doing an initiation!

550
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,970
Scary. Well, carry on.

551
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,008
Just pretend I'm not here.

552
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,206
This is my mom's house.

553
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,002
Do you promise to look out
for your brothers...

554
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,409
...no matter what the peril?

555
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,811
Will you defend Oozma Kappa
no matter how dangerous?

556
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,248
No matter how insurmountable
the odds may be?

557
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,931
From evils both great and small?

558
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,287
In the face of unending pain and...

559
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,811
Forget it! You're in.

560
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,169
Look, we know we're no one's
first choice for a fraternity,

561
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,527
so it means a lot
to have you here with us.

562
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,491
Can't wait to start Scaring
with you, brothers.

563
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,369
- Time for a celebration!
- Yeah!

564
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,087
Grab the couch cushions, gentlemen,
because we're building a fort!

565
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,723
Mom, can we stay up late tonight?

566
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,451
I know you're a princess
and I'm just a stable boy.

567
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,330
Yuck!

568
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,208
- Mom! What are you doing?
- Your grubby paw was in my bed!

569
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,645
Were you kissing my hand?

570
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,530
No. And what about you
with all your shedding?

571
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,090
- I don't shed.
- Really.

572
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,725
- Excuse me.
- I just want to get my stuff.

573
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,847
- Would you just...
- Hey. Come on!

574
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,331
...let me get my stuff!

575
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,325
First morning in the house.

576
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,124
That's going in the album!

577
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,090
- Guys! We got a letter!
- A letter?

578
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,650
We never get mail.

579
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,041
- Sorry. It's stuck.
- Would you... Give me that!

580
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,411
Tentacles. They're sticky.

581
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,687
It's the first event
of the Scare Games.

582
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,361
"A child's room is where you scare,

583
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,011
"but avoid the toxicity lurking there."

584
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,287
Wait a minute.
Where do they want us to meet?

585
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,764
Of all the sewers on campus,
this one has always been my favorite.

586
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,251
Art, you've been here before?

587
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,051
I have a life outside of the house,
you know.

588
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,203
Welcome to your worst nightmare,

589
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,805
the Scare Games!

590
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,443
Scare Games! Scare Games!

591
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,325
Yes! Yes, I love it!

592
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,245
I love this energy!

593
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,729
Okay. Okay, everybody.

594
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,371
Let's hear it
for the frats and sororities

595
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,808
competing in this year's games...

596
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,804
Jaws Theta Chi!

597
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,969
Python Nu Kappa!

598
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,361
Slugma Slugma Kappa!

599
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,847
Roar Omega Roar!

600
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,641
Eta Hiss Hiss!

601
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,050
And finally, Oozma Kappa.

602
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,211
Hi, Mom!

603
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,165
Smile!

604
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,887
Let's begin the first competition,

605
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,850
the Toxicity Challenge!

606
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,685
Human children are toxic!

607
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,602
And anything they touch is toxic.

608
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,808
We don't have any human toys,

609
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,521
but thanks to MU's biology department,

610
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,443
we found a close second,

611
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,584
the stinging glow urchin!

612
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,247
Trust me when I say,

613
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,209
you are not gonna
want to touch this bad boy!

614
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,521
I want to touch it.

615
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,964
And you certainly don't want
to touch any of its friends.

616
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,406
Yeah, I want to touch them.

617
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,449
This is the starting line.

618
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,808
The light at the end of the tunnel
is the finish line.

619
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,366
And whoever comes in last
is eliminated from the games.

620
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,404
- Mike...
- What is it?

621
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,927
Does that mean if we lose, we're out?

622
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,325
- Don't worry, Smoothie.
- Squishy!

623
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,925
Squishy. We're not going to lose,

624
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,726
because we have everything
we need to win right here.

625
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,441
Heart.

626
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,484
No! Me. I'm going to win the race for us.

627
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,121
All right, all right. That's very cute,

628
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,242
but move, move, move.
I'm going to win this.

629
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,760
It's an obstacle course.
What are you going to do? Roar at it?

630
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,649
I can get through
faster than you, little guy.

631
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,481
Take your place at the starting line!

632
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,769
This is all about teamwork.

633
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,288
Everybody, stick together.

634
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,527
I'm going to beat you
over that finish line.

635
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,011
Get ready to eat my dust.

636
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,844
Hey, guys, should we huddle up?

637
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,529
Attention, teams. One last thing.

638
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,443
Scarers work in the dark.

639
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,329
- I want to go home!
- On your marks...

640
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,730
Hey, good luck, ladies.

641
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,565
Thanks! We're going to
rip you to pieces!

642
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,727
What?

643
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,001
...get set...

644
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,443
Go!

645
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,886
I'm going to touch them!

646
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,486
Come on!

647
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,526
Guys! We're falling behind a little!
Fellas!

648
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,041
Cheese and crackers!

649
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,451
Son of a moustache!

650
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,524
Salisbury steak, that hurts!

651
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,120
Is that as fast as you can go?

652
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,804
- Just getting started!
- What the...

653
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,680
That's got to hurt!

654
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,211
Terry!

655
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,090
Don't worry, we'll be...

656
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,690
Yikes!

657
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,884
Roar Omega Roar wins!

658
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,563
Take that, Wazowski!

659
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,569
Are you delirious? I beat you!

660
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,086
Get your eye checked!

661
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,601
Way to blow it, Oozmas!

662
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,724
Hey! Second place ain't bad.

663
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,484
Second place, Jaws Theta Chi!

664
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,561
What?

665
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,320
Your whole team
has to cross the finish line.

666
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,641
Third place, EEKs!

667
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,245
- Fourth place, PNKs!
- No.

668
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,650
- Fifth place, HSS!
- No, no, no!

669
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,426
And in last place,

670
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,603
Oozma Kappa.

671
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,288
I can't feel my anything.

672
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,729
Shocker! Oozma Kappa
has been eliminated!

673
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,566
No.

674
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,720
Don't look so surprised, Mr. Wazowski.

675
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,448
It would have taken a miracle
for you to...

676
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,762
Attention, everyone.
We have an announcement.

677
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,764
Jaws Theta Chi has been disqualified.

678
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,405
The use of illegal protective gel
is cause for elimination.

679
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,766
What!

680
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,850
Which means Oozma Kappa
is back in the games!

681
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,805
It's a miracle!

682
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,162
Your luck will run out, eventually.

683
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,962
This is going to be
harder than I thought.

684
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,561
Okay! Listen up, Oozmas.

685
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,108
Now, we're going to have to start
winning these things together,

686
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,406
so that means I'm going to need

687
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,084
each of you guys
to pull your own weight.

688
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,400
- Mike?
- What is it?

689
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,767
We've made a list of
our strengths and weaknesses.

690
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,049
In high school, I was
the master of the silent scare.

691
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,563
I could sneak up on a field mouse
in a pillow factory.

692
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,927
Sorry! They get stickier
when I'm sweaty.

693
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,649
Oh, my gosh, that's terrible.

694
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,008
We're experts in the ancient craft
of close-up magic.

695
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,890
It's all about misdirection.

696
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,091
I have an extra toe.

697
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,321
Not with me, of course.

698
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,771
Guys, one slip-up on the next event,
and we're goners.

699
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,921
So for this to work,

700
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,685
I'm gonna need you
to take every instinct you have

701
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,250
and bury it deep, deep down.

702
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,642
- Done.
- From now on, we are of one mind.

703
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,721
My mind.

704
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,881
Please.

705
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,200
I will tell you exactly what to do,
and how to do it.

706
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,363
Okay, Mike. Seems about right.

707
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,926
All right. Give me scary steps.

708
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,923
Fifty up and down, right now. Let's go!

709
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,685
You're wasting your time.
We need a new team.

710
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,491
We can't just "get a new team"!

711
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,401
I checked this morning.
It's against the rules.

712
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,589
What if we disguised a new team
to look like the old team?

713
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,204
No, no. We are not cheating.

714
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,447
It's not cheating. I'm just, you know,
leveling the playing field.

715
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,367
Okay, so it's kind of cheating,
but what do you want me to do?

716
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,480
They're not exactly
the scariest group in the world.

717
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,724
Oh, a ladybug!
Make a wish! Make a wish!

718
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,045
This is not going to work.

719
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,770
Where are you going? We're training.

720
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,887
I'm a Sullivan.

721
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,003
That's not enough.
You're all over the place.

722
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,401
You're charging ahead when you...

723
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,801
You tell them what to do but not me.

724
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,530
So long, Coach.

725
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,851
Okay, Oozmas...

726
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,806
Boy, we need to get you a bell.

727
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,561
Listen up. "if a kid hears you coming,
they'll call Mom or Dad,

728
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,180
"then you'd better run fast
or things will get bad."

729
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,083
In the next event,
if even one of us gets caught,

730
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,730
we're all out.

731
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,406
So remember, do exactly what I do.

732
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,363
We are at
the halfway point of the second event,

733
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,287
and things are getting interesting.

734
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,206
Got it.

735
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,526
Only two teams left.

736
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,884
Who will make it out with their flag,

737
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,604
and who will be eliminated?

738
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,681
In a real Scare,

739
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,361
you do not want to get caught
by a kid's parent.

740
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,569
And in this event,
you do not want to get caught by

741
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,120
the librarian.

742
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,009
Quiet.

743
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,282
What's so scary
about a little old librarian?

744
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,127
I said, "Quiet."

745
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,403
- Faster.
- Slow and steady.

746
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,289
- Slow and steady.
- Slow and steady.

747
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,407
Slow and steady.

748
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,170
Slow and steady.

749
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,848
- Sullivan!
- Sullivan!

750
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,084
No!

751
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,886
Five, six, seven, eight!

752
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,086
Look over here!

753
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,808
- Is that legal?
- You better believe it, mop top!

754
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,042
The only rule is don't get caught.

755
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,250
Hey! Over here!

756
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,364
- Come and get me!
- Come and get me!

757
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,487
Guys, what are you doing?

758
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,721
They said don't let her catch you.

759
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,325
But they didn't say how!

760
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,000
Move it! Move it! Move it! Come on!

761
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,321
We did it!

762
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,166
No, we didn't. We forgot the flag!

763
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,651
Mike?

764
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,724
'Way to 90, Squishy!
'Way to 90, Squishy!

765
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,041
How?

766
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,123
Misdirection.

767
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,568
The EEKs have been eliminated

768
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,962
and Oozma Kappa live
to scare another day!

769
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,642
We're OK! We're OK! We're OK!

770
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,924
I've never felt so alive!

771
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,081
We were awesome!

772
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,367
Okay, look. That wasn't real Scaring.

773
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,120
It was better than what you did.

774
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,571
You should've stuck to my strategy.

775
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,881
Whatever.

776
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,610
Talk to me when we start
the real Scaring.

777
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,481
Hey! You guys going to the party?

778
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,724
I think you've got the wrong guys.

779
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,768
- We don't get invited to...
- Party?

780
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,604
The mid-games mixer at the RORs'.

781
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,728
It's for the top Scare Teams.

782
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,926
You're one of us now, right?

783
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,486
See you there!

784
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,762
- Did you hear that?
- I can't believe it!

785
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,649
- Badidea.
- This is great.

786
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,327
They're finally seeing us
as real Scarers. We're going!

787
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,523
Do young people still dance?

788
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,285
Because my moves are a little rusty.

789
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,249
We forgot to bring a hostess gift.

790
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,280
We can't go in there
without some scented candles.

791
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,846
Calm down. We earned this.

792
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,924
What if there's
a lull in the conversation?

793
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,002
I never know what to... You know...

794
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,201
Say?

795
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,851
How are you so good at this?

796
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,042
You just took on
an angry 50-foot librarian,

797
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,009
and you're afraid of a little party?

798
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,320
Take a deep breath...

799
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,801
...and in you go!

800
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,527
Hello.

801
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,401
- It's Oozma Kappa!
- These guys are crazy!

802
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,642
What you did today was insane!

803
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,881
That was awesome!

804
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,050
Oozma Kappa,
tonight we party like Scarers!

805
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,325
I've never stayed up this late in my life!

806
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,921
Hey, quiet! Quiet!

807
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,165
Quiet down, you can-wranglers.

808
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,682
All right. On behalf of the RORs,

809
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,368
we'd like to congratulate all the teams
that have made it this far.

810
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,761
All, right, let's hear it for the PNKs!

811
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,921
I love that trick! Never gets old. HSS!

812
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,641
Very creepy-

813
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:40,009
And finally, the surprise team
of the Scare Games,

814
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,886
Oozma Kappa!

815
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,441
Come on over, guys.

816
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,851
Now, I got to admit, fellas,

817
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,362
I thought you were a bunch of nobodies.

818
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,651
But, boy, was I wrong.

819
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,009
Let's hear it for Oozma Kappa!

820
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,208
Oozma Kappa!

821
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,406
Oh!

822
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,041
What?

823
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,284
The most adorable monsters
on campus.

824
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,130
Release the stuffed animals.

825
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,721
Faced!

826
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,322
Don't worry.
Nobody reads the school paper.

827
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,926
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure
they read the quad.

828
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,967
Thank you very much.

829
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,610
Okay. Would you like that
with two sleeves or four?

830
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,420
Thanks. Tell your friends.

831
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,525
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

832
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,000
Raising a little money for charity.

833
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,326
Yeah? Well, stop it.

834
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,001
You want us to stop raising money
for charity? That's not cool.

835
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,445
This guy hates charity!

836
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,487
I want you to stop making us
look like fools.

837
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,451
Hey, you're making yourselves
look like fools.

838
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,285
Let's be honest, boys.

839
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,328
You're never going to be real Scarers,

840
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,210
because real Scarers look like us.

841
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,562
But, hey, if you really want
to work for a Scare company

842
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,810
they're always hiring in the mailroom.

843
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,487
Guys, hold on!

844
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,125
Hey, hey, hey! Wait a second.
Don't listen to him.

845
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,930
We just need to keep trying.

846
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,128
No, you need to stop trying!

847
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,567
You can train monsters like this
all you want,

848
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,165
but you can't change who they are.

849
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,161
Mike...

850
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,322
We appreciate everything you've done,
but he's right.

851
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:58,011
No matter how much we train,
we'll never look like them.

852
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,521
We're built

853
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,126
for other things.

854
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,447
Sorry, squirt!

855
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,887
Some monsters just aren't
cut out for the big leagues.

856
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,051
The big leagues.

857
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,761
Guys.

858
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,044
We're going on a little field trip.

859
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,365
My tentacle fell asleep.

860
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,404
- Thanks, Mom.
- Have fun, kids!

861
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,205
I'll just be here listening to my tunes.

862
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,526
Hey, where are we?

863
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,965
The big leagues.

864
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,845
Holy rely-poly-

865
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,001
Wow.

866
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,650
Nice fence.

867
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,210
This is amazing, Mike.

868
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,405
We're not stopping here.

869
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,648
This is crazy.
We're going to get arrested!

870
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,322
<i>AH Scare Floors now active.</i>

871
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,166
<i>West coast coming online.
Scarers coming out.</i>

872
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,121
Look at them.

873
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,845
They're going into the human world,

874
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,042
and they don't even look scared!

875
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,566
Wow.

876
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,569
Take a good look, fellas.

877
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,889
See what they all have in common?

878
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,130
No, not really.

879
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,647
Exactly. There's no one type of Scarer.

880
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,321
The best Scarers use their differences
to their advantage.

881
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,886
- Wow.
- Terri? Look.

882
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:19,807
Hey!

883
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,645
Look at that old feller
racking up the big numbers!

884
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,883
Don, that old fella is
Earl "The Terror" Thompson!

885
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,406
What? Where? That's really him?

886
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,687
He held the Scare Record
for three years!

887
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,883
Oh, third door from the end!

888
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,327
Carla "Killer Claws" Benitez!

889
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,428
Look!
It's "Screaming" Bob Gunderson!

890
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,560
- I still have his rookie card.
- Me, too!

891
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,131
Doesn't have the speed anymore,
but his

892
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,601
- technique is flawless.
- Technique is flawless.

893
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,364
You collected Scare Cards, huh?

894
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,204
Yep. 450 of them.

895
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,090
Impressive.
I have 6,000 still in mint condition,

896
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,721
but, you know, 450 is pretty good, too.

897
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,081
Hey, look at me!
I'm Earl "The Terror" Thompson!

898
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,846
That's great!

899
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,488
That's a pretty good one, Squish.

900
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,726
I've been a real jerk.

901
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,486
So have I.

902
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,806
But it's not too late.

903
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,205
We could be a great team.
We just need to start working together.

904
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,721
Hey!

905
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,841
What are you doing up there?

906
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,726
I can't go back to jail!

907
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,041
Come on!

908
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,531
They're right behind us!

909
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,641
Get back here!

910
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,561
Up there! Get them!

911
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,204
- Thanks, brother!
- Don't mention it.

912
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:56,165
I'm fine, really!
It's just a little heart attack.

913
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,688
I want a piece of that action!

914
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,006
Mom! Start the car!

915
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,323
- What?
- Start the car!

916
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:16,766
Stop the bar?

917
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,528
The car! Start the car!

918
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:20,721
Oh, okay.

919
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:23,920
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

920
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:24,961
Get in! Get in!

921
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,283
- Mom, go!
- Seatbelts.

922
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,821
- Okay, go!
- Does anyone want gum?

923
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:31,901
Just drive!

924
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,966
Okay. Here we go!

925
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,483
Oh, yeah!
Let's break in somewhere else!

926
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,563
Rise and shine!

927
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,810
Scary feet, scary feet...
The kid is in the bathroom!

928
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,769
Scary feet, scary feet...
Oh, he's back!

929
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:14,721
Wake up!

930
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,765
Thirty-seven! Thirty-eight!

931
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,049
Do I hear thirty-nine?
Come on!

932
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,603
Yes! Okay, Oozma Kappa,
you're looking good.

933
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,129
"To frighten a child
is the point of a Scare.

934
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,010
"If you frighten a teen,
then Scarer beware."

935
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,807
Okay, scare the little kid.

936
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,166
Avoid the teenager!

937
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,531
I'm on the phone!

938
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,887
No one understands me!

939
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,087
Whatever.

940
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,685
But, Daddy, I love him!

941
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,164
<i>First place, Roar Omega Roar!</i>

942
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,242
<i>Second place, Oozma Kappa!</i>

943
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,160
<i>Third place, HSS.</i>

944
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,486
You're lame.

945
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,290
"Someone is coming,
this could ruin your night.

946
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:16,647
"Stay hidden, take cover,
and stay out of sight!"

947
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,131
You got 10 seconds. Go!

948
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:23,524
Kiosk! Pile of leaves!
Standing out in the open.

949
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,480
And there should be one more.

950
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,528
How did I do?

951
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,586
Oh, not too shabby, Don!

952
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,768
Thanks! I cannot get down.

953
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,526
Zombie snarl!

954
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,602
Angry poodle. Jazz clown.

955
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,806
My Aunt Phyllis.

956
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:37,927
In the morning.

957
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,246
That's what I'm talking about!

958
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,408
Time to go to work.

959
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,281
You're out!

960
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,001
You're out.

961
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:21,082
Hey, tough luck, Kris Kringle.

962
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,040
Thank you.

963
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,246
Yeah!

964
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:40,541
Yeah!

965
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,846
<i>We're down to two remaining teams,</i>

966
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:46,003
Roar Omega Roar and Oozma <i>Kappa!</i>

967
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,204
Which leads us to the final event!

968
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,800
"Every one of your skills
will be put to the test.

969
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,488
"The Scare Simulator will prove
who's the best!"

970
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,167
Tomorrow night you finally get to Scare

971
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,885
in front of the whole school!

972
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,611
Enjoy the attention while it lasts, boys.

973
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:07,489
After you lose,
no one will remember you.

974
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:11,680
Maybe. But when you lose,
no one will let you forget it.

975
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:16,083
Oh, boy. That is a good point.

976
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,725
Hey, Oozmas, you guys are awesome!

977
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,768
You've got to teach us your moves.

978
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,491
Well, then you're gonna
want to talk to this guy.

979
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,808
Sure, I can teach you.

980
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,450
All right. You want to hide
behind the chair?

981
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,680
You have to become the chair.

982
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,210
Thanks for coming, Dean.

983
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,121
Dean Hardscrabble!

984
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,891
If we get back into the Scaring program,

985
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,246
I hope there's no hard feelings.

986
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,040
Tomorrow, each of you must prove
that you are undeniably scary.

987
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,723
And I know for a fact
that one of you is not.

988
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,049
No. He works harder than anyone.

989
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,446
Do you think he's scary?

990
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,170
He's the heart and soul of the team!

991
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,368
Do you think he's scary?

992
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,927
We're going to win this thing
tomorrow, Sull, I can feel it!

993
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,642
We'll finally have our lives
back on track.

994
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,720
Hey. Mike?

995
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:27,009
You know, you've given me
a lot of really great tips.

996
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,605
I'd love to return the favor sometime.

997
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,328
Yeah, sure. Anytime.

998
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:34,926
- We're doing this now?
- Okay.

999
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,682
You've memorized every textbook,
every Scare Theory, and that is great.

1000
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,125
Hey!

1001
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,929
But now it's time to forget all that.

1002
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,049
Just reach deep down
and let the scary out!

1003
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,925
Just feel it.

1004
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,480
Exactly. Go wild.

1005
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,922
I don't know. I've kind of
got my own technique.

1006
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,361
Give it a try.

1007
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,885
Good, but bigger!

1008
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,842
Nope. You're thinking again.
From the gut!

1009
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,326
Let the animal out!

1010
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,605
Come on! Dig deep!

1011
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,766
Boys! It's a school night!

1012
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,764
So, how was that?

1013
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,366
Up top.

1014
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,882
You know, it did feel different!
I feel like it's all coming together.

1015
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,884
Yup, this time tomorrow
the whole school is finally going to see

1016
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,769
what Mike Wazowski can do.

1017
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,410

Hold on. Mike's the one
who started all this

1035

if he's the one who finishes it.

Yes!

Yeah, Mike. Finish strong!

- Come on, buddy.

1052
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:32,801
You can do it.

1053
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,521
Yes!

1054
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:55,280
<i>Next up, Sullivan and Boggs!</i>

1055
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,126
You got this, Sull.

1056
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,886
<i>And it's all tied up!</i>

1057
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,364
<i>Ah! Tough break for the RORs.</i>

1058
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:38,961
Hearts?

1059
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,802
Way to 90, Boggs!

1060
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,883
That's the last time
I lose to you, Sullivan.

1061
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:53,249
<i>Worthington and Wazowski,
to the starting line.</i>

1062
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,121
Hey-

1063
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:01,800
Don't worry about Hardscrabble.

1064
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,490
Don't worry about anyone else.

1065
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,408
Just go out there and show them
what Mike Wazowski can do.

1066
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,001
Thanks.

1067
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,967
Don't take the loss too hard.

1068
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,849
You never belonged here anyway.

1069
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,885
<i>Amazing
performance by Worthington!</i>

1070
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,929
- Johnny, you're my hero!
- ROR! ROR!

1071
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:06,004
<i>The Oozmas will need
a record-breaking Scare to win this.</i>

1072
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,804
<i>You don't belong on a Scare Floor.</i>

1073
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:10,881
<i>No one will remember you.</i>

1074
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,564
<i>You're not scary.</i>

1075
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:15,166
<i>Come on! Dig deep!</i>

1076
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,882
Yeah!

1077
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:27,921
<i>They did it!</i>

1078
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,168
Yeah! Hey!

1079
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,684
We're in the Scare program! Yeah!

1080
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:58,682
Come here, you son of a gun!

1081
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,286
- Way to go!
- Yeah!

1082
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:02,930
A little stuck.

1083
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,644
Pardon me there, Ms. Squibbles.

1084
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,041
It's Sherrie.

1085
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,851
We did it!

1086
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,366
Way to go, Oozma Kappa!

1087
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:17,566
- Thank you!
- Thanks a lot.

1088
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:20,445
- You rule!
- I have never ruled before.

1089
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:22,488
You guys killed it out there!

1090
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,647
Awesome!

1091
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,404
Hey, Wazowski!

1092
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,051
Come on, let's go, you maniac!
We're celebrating.

1093
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,286
Mike?

1094
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,045
I did it.

1095
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,804
I can't believe it.

1096
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,050
I'm going to be a Scarer!

1097
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:40,766
Yeah, yes, you are.

1098
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,162
You hear that? Get plenty of rest, kiddo.

1099
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:46,164
You haven't seen the last
of Mike Wazowski. Boo!

1100
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:56,801
I knew I was scary.
I didn't know I was that scary.

1101
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,486
Yeah, we're so scary
I guess we broke it.

1102
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:00,891
Come on.

1103
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,211
It's been tampered with.

1104
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,161
I don't think you should be
messing with that.

1105
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,367
Why are my settings different?

1106
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,285
Mike, we should leave.

1107
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,569
- Did you do this?
- Mike.

1108
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:25,926
Did you do this?

1109
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:28,511
I...

1110
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,607
Yes, I did. But you don't understand.

1111
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,969
Why? Why did you do this?

1112
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,448
You know, just in case.

1113
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:37,926
In case of what?

1114
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,051
You don't think I'm scary.

1115
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,802
- Mike...
- You said you believed in me.

1116
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,440
But you're just like Hardscrabble.
You're just like everyone else!

1117
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:49,887
Look, you'll get better and better...

1118
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,587
I'm as scary as you!
I'm as scary as anyone!

1119
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,170
- I just wanted to help.
- No.

1120
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:55,765
You just wanted to help yourself.

1121
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,041
Well, what was I supposed to do?

1122
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,441
Let the whole team fail
because you don't have it?

1123
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,402
So your calculations were a little off.

1124
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,164
That door took me all semester.

1125
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:39,130
It's too dangerous.
The professor's just going to shred it.

1126
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,889
There he is, the big guy.

1127
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,361
The first of many trophies, I am sure.

1128
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,201
Sullivan.

1129
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,250
Nice work out there.

1130
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,049
I look forward to having you
back in class.

1131
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:01,210
Hey, there he is!

1132
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,727
Looks like I was wrong about you.

1133
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,086
You're one of us after all.

1134
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:09,204
Way to go, Sulley!
Welcome back, broham!

1135
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,243
You are one of us now, okay?

1136
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,723
Anytime you want to come hang out
and do whatever, you got a crew.

1137
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,849
You're a ROR, buddy!

1138
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:19,921
Hey!

1139
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,806
Where are you going?

1140
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,126
You did what?

1141
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,170
My team had nothing to do with it.

1142
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:42,050
It was all me. I cheated.

1143
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,202
I expect you off campus by tomorrow.

1144
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:47,806
Yes, ma'am.

1145
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:51,041
You're a disgrace to this university

1146
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,362
and your family name.

1147
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,681
What's going on?

1148
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,171
Someone broke into the door lab!

1149
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:03,481
What?

1150
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:07,681
Oh, no.

1151
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,882
Open the door! Don't go in there!

1152
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,407
You look funny.

1153
01:18:58,960 --> 01:18:59,961
What?

1154
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,962
I'm so tired. What's going on?

1155
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,360
It's the middle of the night.

1156
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,490
A little funny green guy.

1157
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,525
I want to touch it! It's so cute!

1158
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,206
James!

1159
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:35,404
No one goes near that door
until the authorities arrive.

1160
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:36,761
You don't think that could be...

1161
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,888
- It's Mike.
- But he could die out there!

1162
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,646
James, wait! We can help.

1163
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:47,203
Leave it to the old master of sales.

1164
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,327
We got a call in,
but that's the best we can do.

1165
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,922
Don Carlton, sales.
Folks, today is your lucky day.

1166
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,606
How many times have you asked
yourself the following question...

1167
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,410
- Arrest him.
- Pardon?

1168
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:00,641
Spread them, pops!

1169
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,330
- Do you mind?
- Don't move!

1170
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,441
What? Sullivan!

1171
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:04,887
Don't you dare!

1172
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:06,880
Sullivan! Don't go in there!

1173
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:15,687
Mike?

1174
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,444
Mike!

1175
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,602
The kids said
they saw something in the cabin.

1176
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:22,921
- They're calling it an alien.
- It was!

1177
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,366
I saw a little green guy!

1178
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:25,846
What's the problem, ma'am?

1179
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,521
Mike?

1180
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,610
Bear! A bear in the camp!

1181
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,287
Down this way. All right?

1182
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,964
I heard something over here!

1183
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:02,605
Mike!

1184
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,204
Come on, buddy.
Let's get you out of here.

1185
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:15,744
This is all my fault. 
I'm sorry.

1186
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,443
You were right.
They weren't scared of me.

1187
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,283
I did everything right.

1188
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,442
I wanted it more than anyone.

1189
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:32,203
And I thought...
I thought if I wanted it enough,

1190
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,049
I could show everybody that...

1191
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:37,720
That Mike Wazowski
is something special.

1192
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:41,651
And I'm just...

1193
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:44,527
...not.

1194
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,962
Look, Mike, I know how you feel.

1195
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,043
Don't do that! Please, don't do that!

1196
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,691
- You do not know how I feel.
- Mike, calm down.

1197
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:00,280
Monsters like you have everything.
You don't have to be good.

1198
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,607
You can mess up over and over again

1199
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,205
- and the whole world loves you.
- Mike...

1200
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:07,841
You'll never know what it's like to fail
because you were born a Sullivan!

1201
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:11,010
Yeah, I'm a Sullivan.
I'm the Sullivan who flunked every test.

1202
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,720
The one who got kicked out
of the program,

1203
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:14,922
the one who was so afraid
to let everyone down

1204
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,286
that I cheated.

1205
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:17,766
And I lied.

1206
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,602
Mike, I'll never know how you feel,

1207
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,242
but you're not the only failure here.

1208
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:36,002
I act scary, Mike, but most of the time

1209
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:38,925
I'm terrified.

1210
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,169
How come you never
told me that before?

1211
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,246
Because...

1212
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,562
we weren't friends before.

1213
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:05,727
Check the lake!

1214
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,242
I heard something here!

1215
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,571
I saw movement!

1216
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,166
Over there!

1217
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,341
Sulley!

1218
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,800
No!

1219
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:56,081
They're still in there!

1220
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:59,090
Until the authorities arrive,
this door stays off!

1221
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,806
No! You can't do that! No!

1222
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:05,488
Enough! I want this room cleared now!

1223
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,205
You can't do this!

1224
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,245
We got to get out of here!

1225
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,844
- Let them come.
- What?

1226
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,923
If we scare them,
I mean really scare them,

1227
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,190
we could generate enough scream
to power the door from this side!

1228
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,201
What are you talking about?

1229
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:31,964
I have read every book
about Scaring ever written.

1230
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,041
This could work!

1231
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,690
They're adults. I can't do this.

1232
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,371
Yes, you can. Just follow my lead.

1233
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,567
<i>Mama!</i>

1234
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,241
<i>Mama!</i>

1235
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:13,762
<i>Mama...</i>

1236
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,247
What the...

1237
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:34,210
- Now what?
- Phase two.

1238
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,165
Keep together.

1239
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,166
Are you ready?

1240
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,089
- Mike, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1241
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:54,162
Stop being a Sullivan
and start being you.

1242
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,047
Call for backup.

1243
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,440
Assistance on the north side.

1244
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:00,007
Repeat, we need assistance
on the north side.

1245
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,844
<i>Ranger,
answer me, what's your 20?</i>

1246
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,446
We need assistance on the north side.
We have a...

1247
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:05,840
Look! What was it?

1248
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,160
Let's go.

1249
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:44,481
Sulley, come on!

1250
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:11,961
How?

1251
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,845
How did you do this?

1252
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:17,246
Don't ask me.

1253
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,243
Move, move, move!
This is a 54-23 in progress.

1254
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:28,600
All right, everybody, clear out.

1255
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:30,285
Secure the perimeter.

1256
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:32,488
No child breach.
Repeat: no child breach.

1257
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,240
You ruined our doors!

1258
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,607
I've been working on my door
all semester!

1259
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:37,681
Let's go, you two.

1260
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:40,122
- You're alive!
- We are so glad you're safe.

1261
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:44,927
Hey, wait!

1262
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,001
What's going to happen to them?

1263
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:49,163
That's for the university president
to decide.

1264
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:53,845
But you can be sure
we'll be watching these two.

1265
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,843
Always watching.

1266
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,327
- Expelled?
- Yeah, we really messed up.

1267
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:06,009
So, you're leaving?

1268
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:08,567
Yeah, buddy. We have to go.

1269
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:10,965
Harsh, man.

1270
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:13,680
I'm sorry, guys.
You'd be in the Scaring program

1271
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:14,960
right now if it wasn't for us.

1272
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,041
What?

1273
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,267
Well, it is
the gosh-darnedest thing.

1274
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,642
Hardscrabble's letting us
into the Scare program.

1275
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:24,801
What?

1276
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,042
She was impressed with
our performance in the games.

1277
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:29,122
She invited us to join next semester!

1278
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:31,727
Congratulations, guys!

1279
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,162
And that's not the only piece
of good news.

1280
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,924
Sherrie and I are engaged!

1281
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:38,488
Who is Sherrie?

1282
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:40,605
She's my mom.

1283
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:43,604
Well, if it isn't my two favorite fellas!

1284
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:45,250
Come here. Give me some sugar.

1285
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,650
So uncomfortable.

1286
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:50,165
Come on, Scott.

1287
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:52,322
I don't want you to think of me
as your new dad.

1288
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,482
After all, we're fraternity brothers first.

1289
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:55,641
This is so weird.

1290
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:57,485
Just think of me
as your big brother

1291
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,091
that's marrying your mother.

1292
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:00,241
Wait. Hold on.

1293
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:03,529
We're brothers who share
the same mom slash wife.

1294
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,601
That's worse.

1295
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,250
Well, I guess we should be going now.

1296
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,281
Promise me you'll keep in touch.

1297
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:20,091
You're the scariest bunch
of monsters I have ever met.

1298
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:25,967
Don't let anyone tell you different.

1299
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:55,010
So, what now?

1300
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,161
You know, for the first time in my life,
I don't really have a plan.

1301
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:03,168
You're the great Mike Wazowski.
You'll come up with something.

1302
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:07,324
I think it's time I leave the greatness
to other monsters.

1303
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,368
I'm okayjust being okay.

1304
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:20,686
So long, Sull.

1305
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:23,167
Solong.

1306
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:51,486
Wazowski!

1307
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,011
Stop the bus!

1308
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,326
Are you crazy?

1309
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,450
Mike,

1310
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:00,887
I don't know a single Scarer
who can do what you do.

1311
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:03,209
I know, everyone sees us together,

1312
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,806
they think I'm the one running the show,
but the truth is,

1313
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:08,724
I've been riding your coattails
since day one!

1314
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,810
You made the deal with Hardscrabble.

1315
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:13,520
You took a hopeless team
and made them champions.

1316
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,045
All I did was catch a pig!

1317
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:16,720
Technically, I caught the pig.

1318
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:20,010
Exactly! And you think you're just okay?

1319
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,560
You pulled off the biggest Scare
this school has ever seen!

1320
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:24,729
- That wasn't me!
- That was you!

1321
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:26,922
You think I could have done that
without you?

1322
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,407
I didn't even bring a pencil
on the first day of school.

1323
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:34,405
Mike, you're not scary. Not even a little.

1324
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:35,925
But you are fearless.

1325
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:40,606
And if Hardscrabble can't see that,
then she can just...

1326
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:42,802
I can just what?

1327
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:47,922
Careful, Mr. Sullivan.
I was just warming up to you.

1328
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:49,841
Sorry.

1329
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:51,765
Well, gentlemen,

1330
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:56,090
it seems you made the front page again.

1331
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:00,200
The two of you did something together

1332
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,602
that no one has ever done before.

1333
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,165
You surprised me.

1334
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:10,247
Perhaps I should keep an eye out
for more surprises

1335
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:11,810
like you in my program.

1336
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:15,730
But as far as the two of you
are concerned

1337
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,842
there is nothing I can do for you now.

1338
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,930
Except, perhaps, wish you luck.

1339
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:29,806
And, Mr. Wazowski,
keep surprising people.

1340
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:43,681
You know, there is still one way
we can work at a Scare company.

1341
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,408
They're always hiring in the mailroom.

1342
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,569
This is better than I ever imagined!

1343
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:58,371
I bet we break the all-time record
in our first year.

1344
01:32:58,440 --> 01:32:59,885
Mike, we're mail guys.

1345
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:03,169
I know. I'm talking about
the record for letters delivered!

1346
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:07,087
All right, newbies, quit goofing around.

1347
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:09,766
I'll have you know tampering
with the mail is a crime

1348
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,763
- punishable by banishment!
- Yes, sir.

1349
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,444
We're right on it, Mr. Snowman.

1350
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,010
The team of Wazowski and Sullivan

1351
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:17,162
are going to change the world
starting today!

1352
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:18,241
Say scream!

1353
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:19,407
- Scream!
- Scream!

1354
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:05,320
Wazowski, good luck on your first day!

1355
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:06,441
<i>Thanks, Mew.</i>

1356
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:08,522
- Good luck, Mike!
- Thanks, fellas.

1357
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:16,571
You coming, Coach?

1358
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,411
You better believe it.

1359
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:02,805
I made it! My first day of class!

1360
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:07,807
The school year's over, son.
You missed it.

1361
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:10,847
Great.
