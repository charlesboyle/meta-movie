1
00:00:10,482 --> 00:00:13,471
<i>For decades, millions
of people have come here</i>

2
00:00:13,473 --> 00:00:15,419
<i>in search of the American Dream,</i>

3
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:19,418
<i>but for many, that dream
is quickly disappearing.</i>

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,846
<i>Are you unemployed
or stuck in a dead-end job?</i>

5
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:26,979
<i>Thousands of people around the state
are losing their jobs every day.</i>

6
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:29,667
<i>Are you homeless, or living
in a bad neighborhood?</i>

7
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:34,606
<i>Unemployment shot up to its highest
level in nearly 26 years.</i>

8
00:00:34,608 --> 00:00:38,067
<i>If the "American Dream"
broke its promise to you,</i>

9
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:40,385
<i>don't worry, we have an answer.</i>

10
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,105
<i>Let me help you help yourself.</i>

11
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:51,305
I'm gonna give you three and a half grams.
You know what to do with this?

12
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:54,161
'Cause if you know what to do with it,
you gonna be all right.

13
00:00:58,194 --> 00:01:01,217
<i>Welcome to the game.
This is your guide book.</i>

14
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:03,804
<i>Our experts are going to
give you everything you need.</i>

15
00:01:03,806 --> 00:01:09,281
It's very easy to make
a lot of money with cocaine.

16
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:11,835
<i>You could have a six
figure starting salary...</i>

17
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:15,464
It's hard for me to believe that something
that small could be worth so much money.

18
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:17,951
<i>You can make a million
dollars in a week</i>

19
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:21,311
<i>In this program,
masters of the trade</i>

20
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:27,896
<i>on how to get paid in this exciting
$400 billion global industry.</i>

21
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:32,589
<i>For the next 90 minutes, we're going
to focus on marijuana and cocaine,</i>

22
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:37,496
but the same lessons work for any illegal
substance Americans are willing to buy,

23
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:42,468
<i>or climb to the very top of the
food chain and make billions.</i>

24
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,357
<i>This training guide
will show you how to do it.</i>

25
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,180
You want to know how to
make money selling drugs?

26
00:02:02,506 --> 00:02:04,790
<i>Name's Bobby Carlton,</i>

27
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:08,418
I've lived pretty much
in every ghetto town,

28
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,181
and my mom had it rough raising us.
She had me very young.

29
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:15,743
<i>A year after I was, uh,
born, my brother was born.</i>

30
00:02:15,745 --> 00:02:18,364
<i>Years later, I'd have two sisters.</i>

31
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:20,918
Stepfather, two sisters,
he'd eventually leave,

32
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,867
<i>and then she'd be
stuck with four kids.</i>

33
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:24,815
She'd basically just
try to raise a family

34
00:02:24,817 --> 00:02:28,545
and try to earn enough
to put food on the table.

35
00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:31,464
I look at people, they got to get
up, they got to be in an office,

36
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:34,556
they got to go to a factory, they got
to bang their heads against a wall,

37
00:02:34,558 --> 00:02:36,504
<i>they're trying
to earn, earn, earn,</i>

38
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:39,461
but really, what they're doing is
just barely making their payments.

39
00:02:39,463 --> 00:02:43,661
<i>They're working just to get by.</i>

40
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,551
<i>I wanted to make money to go live.</i>

41
00:02:46,553 --> 00:02:49,676
I was always looking up
to the bigger kids,

42
00:02:49,678 --> 00:02:52,565
who, people I perceived cool
and trying to emulate them.

43
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:55,488
The guys hanging on the
street corner, not working,

44
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,680
<i>they have girls, they have
cars, they have money,</i>

45
00:02:58,586 --> 00:03:03,254
they seemingly don't ever have to
be anywhere at any certain time.

46
00:03:03,256 --> 00:03:04,766
And I want in. I'm in.

47
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:09,328
<i>What Bobby Carlton
was about to discover</i>

48
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,873
<i>is that marijuana makes money.</i>

49
00:03:12,118 --> 00:03:14,905
<i>More money than tobacco,
cotton, even corn.</i>

50
00:03:14,907 --> 00:03:20,651
<i>It's the most profitable
farmed product in the country.</i>

51
00:03:20,653 --> 00:03:23,540
I smoked a joint, and then
you just get into it.

52
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:24,952
And then other
people want to do it.

53
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:30,563
<i>seven joints were in a bag,
it's a dollar for a joint,</i>

54
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:32,545
<i>you pay $5 for that bag.</i>

55
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:34,898
Okay.
I'll buy a bag, break it down,

56
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,981
sell five joints,
smoke two myself.

57
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,434
It's kind of innocent, right?

58
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:40,912
<i>Ninth grade...</i>

59
00:03:40,914 --> 00:03:47,498
<i>but then they were like,
"How many grams are in an ounce?"</i>

60
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,161
<i>They were like, "How many pounds
are in a kilo?" I was like, "2.2."</i>

61
00:03:51,163 --> 00:03:53,713
"And do you want me to tell you
how much that costs?"

62
00:03:53,715 --> 00:03:56,099
Hence, everybody at school knew
what I was up to that day.

63
00:04:00,893 --> 00:04:04,622
<i>If Bobby Carlton
can do it, so can you.</i>

64
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:10,872
<i>How do you expand from a small circle
of friends and attract more clients?</i>

65
00:04:10,874 --> 00:04:15,240
Making money
selling drugs is easy.

66
00:04:15,242 --> 00:04:18,634
<i>Meet Pepe, a retired Southern
California drug dealer,</i>

67
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:22,363
<i>who's going to tell you how
simple it is to get customers.</i>

68
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:28,109
Like I say, is not hard.
Everybody can do it.

69
00:04:28,111 --> 00:04:31,099
Well, you just walk out to
the street and the park

70
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:35,937
and everybody is gonna say,
"Hey! Spark it up," and you'll start rolling.

71
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:39,466
If you smoke outside, you make a
friend, because weed makes friends.

72
00:04:40,643 --> 00:04:42,120
Weed makes friends.

73
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,891
<i>Now that you've
got some customers,</i>

74
00:04:45,893 --> 00:04:47,303
<i>you're gonna need some product.</i>

75
00:04:47,305 --> 00:04:48,478
<i>Where do you get it?</i>

76
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,947
<i>Most people know where to get it,</i>

77
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:57,013
and if you don't know where to
get marijuana in bulk to sell,

78
00:04:57,015 --> 00:04:59,970
all you have to do is ask one or two
people, and someone's gonna know.

79
00:04:59,972 --> 00:05:04,002
People will front you as
many drugs as you can sell.

80
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:07,059
As long as you can continue to pay people
back, they will front them to you.

81
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:09,781
<i>And if you want to skip the middle men?
Grow your own weed.</i>

82
00:05:12,336 --> 00:05:17,274
Pepe spent quite a few winters making a lot
of money without ever having to leave home.

83
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:21,440
To grow some weed, uh, in your
house, you only need electricity,

84
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:23,860
big lamps, and water.

85
00:05:23,862 --> 00:05:26,649
<i>You get in the internet,
you have the seeds, you know.</i>

86
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:30,479
<i>This is just kind of like
a starter kit for people.</i>

87
00:05:31,657 --> 00:05:35,351
<i>You can get it at any hydroponics
store and get your whole setup.</i>

88
00:05:35,353 --> 00:05:38,946
<i>They'll sell you the tubes, the
nutrients, the little planters.</i>

89
00:05:38,948 --> 00:05:42,307
<i>In about 45 days, these will
grow to about six feet tall,</i>

90
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,423
be lush, green, and lovely.

91
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:51,346
<i>let it dry for a couple of days,
and then pick all the buds off.</i>

92
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,459
<i>So how much money
can you expect to make?</i>

93
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:55,610
Yeah, you can make a lot of money.

94
00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:58,365
I mean, like, is gonna grow
a pound for each plant,

95
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:01,221
and a pound in the streets

96
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:04,682
goes $2,500, $3,000,
if it is a good weed.

97
00:06:04,684 --> 00:06:07,370
Per 10, how much you gonna have?

98
00:06:07,372 --> 00:06:08,916
$30,000.

99
00:06:09,925 --> 00:06:13,586
In three months, people,
they doing a whole house.

100
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:16,475
If you put 50, 150 thousand.

101
00:06:20,677 --> 00:06:23,531
<i>For many dealers, the risk
of jail time is worth it.</i>

102
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,850
You make $100,000 selling drugs.

103
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:29,445
Hide the money, and go to jail, and
when you come out, you have money.

104
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:32,772
If somebody gave me $100,000
to go to jail for five years,

105
00:06:32,774 --> 00:06:34,989
I would take it, you know.

106
00:06:34,991 --> 00:06:36,670
What the fuck. I mean, you...

107
00:06:36,672 --> 00:06:38,181
Sometimes, you work 10 years

108
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:41,575
and you don't even see $20,000
in your bank account.

109
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:45,876
<i>But the nearly one million Americans
arrested each year for marijuana</i>

110
00:06:45,878 --> 00:06:49,606
<i>are caught on possession charges,
and never even sold a joint.</i>

111
00:06:49,382 --> 00:06:52,639
<i>Given the risks, you'll want to
save your money as fast as you can</i>

112
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:54,655
<i>and start trading
more expensive drugs.</i>

113
00:06:54,657 --> 00:06:57,040
I got into cocaine,
and I loved it.

114
00:06:58,956 --> 00:07:02,719
<i>When it comes to cocaine, America
is the land of opportunity.</i>

115
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:06,180
<i>It's the number one consumer
of coke in the world.</i>

116
00:07:06,182 --> 00:07:08,230
<i>The largest study of bank notes</i>

117
00:07:08,232 --> 00:07:10,716
<i>has found that nearly
nine out of 10 bills</i>

118
00:07:10,718 --> 00:07:13,975
<i>circulating in the U.S.
are tainted with cocaine.</i>

119
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:15,123
<i>It's a law of nature.</i>

120
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,442
<i>Where there's demand,
there's supply.</i>

121
00:07:17,444 --> 00:07:19,155
<i>And that's where you come in.</i>

122
00:07:19,157 --> 00:07:21,171
<i>The life of a coke dealer
isn't easy.</i>

123
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,196
<i>When you start out,
you're alone, unprotected,</i>

124
00:07:24,198 --> 00:07:27,959
<i>at the bottom of a ruthless,
international crime syndicate.</i>

125
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:32,226
<i>Most of the world's cocaine is manufactured
by drug lords in South America.</i>

126
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:35,855
<i>They smuggle over 500 tons into the U.S.
every year.</i>

127
00:07:35,857 --> 00:07:39,248
<i>Along the way, it passes through
a long line of distributers,</i>

128
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:41,105
<i>until a couple
of grams get to you,</i>

129
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:44,466
<i>a pawn in a massive,
70 billion dollar game.</i>

130
00:07:48,398 --> 00:07:52,731
Pawns, man, in the game,
they get capped quick.

131
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,318
They be out the game early.

132
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,536
Unless they some smart ass pawns.

133
00:08:00,796 --> 00:08:05,096
<i>Curtis Jackson, otherwise known
as 50 Cent, had to learn quick.</i>

134
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:08,726
My mom hustled to provide
for me, financially.

135
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:13,631
And her friends were all the people that
were out selling drugs as a lifestyle.

136
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:15,916
<i>Curtis was raised
without a father,</i>

137
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:18,806
<i>and his mother was murdered
when he was eight years old.</i>

138
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:20,822
My mom was all I had,

139
00:08:20,824 --> 00:08:26,601
so when I lost her, I lost everything
that was pretty much good in my life.

140
00:08:26,603 --> 00:08:29,053
<i>Her old friends bought me things,</i>

141
00:08:29,055 --> 00:08:31,204
<i>then they got tired
of just buying me things.</i>

142
00:08:32,683 --> 00:08:34,832
They gave me an eight
ball of cocaine.

143
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:38,328
And they told me,
if anybody bothers you,

144
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,814
you know, you tell them
you got it from us,

145
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:44,409
and you'll be all right
in the neighborhood.

146
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:47,735
I was about 12 years old
when that happened to me.

147
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:53,055
<i>That's the incredible
thing about cocaine.</i>

148
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:56,818
<i>You can use it to make ends meet
when there are no other options.</i>

149
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,876
<i>You can be anybody, even a kid.</i>

150
00:08:59,878 --> 00:09:04,009
I would say about 14 or 15. That's when I
pretty much started into the drug trade.

151
00:09:03,846 --> 00:09:08,515
<i>Let's say you're down and out, like
John was, living in South Central L.A.,</i>

152
00:09:08,517 --> 00:09:10,161
<i>crashing at your family's place,</i>

153
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:12,580
<i>with no money, not even for food.</i>

154
00:09:12,582 --> 00:09:14,797
<i>We were living in the back
of my uncle's house.</i>

155
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,015
<i>He had this lemon tree, and one
day he came out and he was like,</i>

156
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:21,619
We didn't have no food. You know, me and
my mom was eating lemons for dinner.

157
00:09:21,621 --> 00:09:23,668
So, after that, I had to get paid.

158
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:28,204
<i>The money that you could make
on the corner was real good.</i>

159
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:32,337
I started off with small amounts,
then I got to the big amounts.

160
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:36,370
<i>Crack, the most popular form of
cocaine sold in the open market.</i>

161
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:39,729
<i>It's cheaper than powder, so low
income users can afford it.</i>

162
00:09:39,731 --> 00:09:41,342
<i>When you work for an organization,</i>

163
00:09:41,344 --> 00:09:44,198
<i>they'll supply you with
$10 crack cocaine rocks.</i>

164
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,315
<i>Because most of your
customers are addicts,</i>

165
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:49,440
<i>they'll be impatient to make a
buy right out on the street.</i>

166
00:09:49,258 --> 00:09:52,750
<i>And the good thing about crack
fiends is they'll keep coming back.</i>

167
00:09:52,752 --> 00:09:55,942
Some guys will make anywhere
from $1,000 to $10,000 a day.

168
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:04,410
<i>Are you the man
with them jumbo 6s?</i>

169
00:10:04,412 --> 00:10:06,896
I'll take about three
or four hundred.

170
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:09,181
Damn.

171
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:20,403
<i>It's harder than functioning in
mainstream or corporate America</i>

172
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:22,924
<i>because the dynamics
of it is different.</i>

173
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:27,459
In order to take a position in that world,
you can just, "pow." Just shoot.

174
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,576
<i>The chances of getting robbed
are pretty great, you know?</i>

175
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:32,366
You do as much as you
can to minimize that,

176
00:10:32,368 --> 00:10:34,549
but somebody at some point
is gonna want what you have,

177
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,363
and they're not gonna have
the money to pay for it.

178
00:10:36,365 --> 00:10:38,279
They are gonna try
and take it from you.

179
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:43,319
<i>with 30 years' experience investigating
the criminal drug world.</i>

180
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:49,266
If I steal a television set out
of, uh, you know, Best Buy,

181
00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:53,635
it lists for $1,000, I'll sell
it for $200 on the street.

182
00:10:53,637 --> 00:10:58,439
If I go rob the dope dealer,
I get all his cash,

183
00:10:58,441 --> 00:10:59,716
and I get drugs.

184
00:10:59,718 --> 00:11:01,800
And the advantage
of stolen drugs is

185
00:11:01,802 --> 00:11:04,723
when I steal a guy's coke
that's worth $1,000,

186
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:06,647
I get to sell it for $1,000!

187
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:08,696
There's no discount for hot dope.

188
00:11:08,698 --> 00:11:10,175
Ever happened to you?

189
00:11:10,177 --> 00:11:12,022
Mmm.

190
00:11:12,024 --> 00:11:14,039
Not me. No, I never had
no problems like that.

191
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,760
'Cause at the end of the day, you fuck
me, you gonna know what's happening.

192
00:11:16,762 --> 00:11:21,364
Are you gonna give them your drugs or
are you gonna tell them to fuck off?

193
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:23,615
And I'm the person
that's gonna say fuck off.

194
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:26,807
If you don't have a pistol, I don't
know why you even selling dope.

195
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:29,697
You won't last. 'Cause
somebody gonna try you.

196
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:32,821
<i>Anyone who is dealing
drugs in this community,</i>

197
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:36,374
<i>if they do not have a gun on
them, believe me, it's close by.</i>

198
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:40,506
<i>It's under a stoop, right around a
corner, tucked behind a phone booth,</i>

199
00:11:40,508 --> 00:11:41,683
but it's close by.

200
00:11:41,685 --> 00:11:45,547
They look up in your face,
they look up in your eye,

201
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:47,596
they see the gun and they
know who's gonna use it,

202
00:11:47,598 --> 00:11:48,705
who ain't gonna use it.

203
00:11:50,722 --> 00:11:53,611
A, assess.
"Don't shoot them, kill them."

204
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:57,340
Because if you shoot them, you gonna
make them angry enough to come back

205
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,516
and really hurt you.

206
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,700
So, if you're gonna shoot,
shoot to kill.

207
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:05,505
It was like motherfuckers were shooting
each other every day on the news.

208
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:08,899
It was like, New York, very much
like a stabbing society, you know.

209
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:11,688
Something goes wrong, somebody
sticks a knife in your chest.

210
00:12:11,452 --> 00:12:14,171
It was a drug deal gone bad,
I got the worst of it.

211
00:12:14,173 --> 00:12:17,061
Stabbed here, stabbed
here, stabbed here.

212
00:12:16,793 --> 00:12:21,092
Once in the back of the head, once in
the chest, entered the left ventricle,

213
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:23,914
and this is from
the open heart surgery.

214
00:12:25,865 --> 00:12:31,140
<i>I don't want to say it's a miracle, but
the doctor brought me back to life.</i>

215
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:34,131
<i>If you really want to lower
your risk of getting hurt,</i>

216
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:37,894
<i>stabbed or shot, packing a
gun can only get you so far.</i>

217
00:12:37,696 --> 00:12:39,776
<i>Hiring backup is a great idea.</i>

218
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:41,121
Who do I hire?

219
00:12:41,123 --> 00:12:44,112
Do I hire nobody...
Nobody's heard of?

220
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:46,631
Or do I hire a guy who's
got the biggest reputation

221
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,916
for being the craziest
motherfucker?

222
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:54,091
The illegal drug market hires people
with reputations for violence.

223
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:56,579
<i>But don't think just because
you have a gun and a few guys,</i>

224
00:12:56,581 --> 00:12:59,535
<i>you can just go out and
start acquiring territory.</i>

225
00:12:59,537 --> 00:13:04,643
Officer Neill Franklin served 33 years on the
Maryland State and Baltimore police forces.

226
00:13:04,645 --> 00:13:08,137
<i>Having overseen 17 drug task
forces, he can tell you,</i>

227
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:10,053
<i>if you want to be
a corner hustler,</i>

228
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,035
<i>you're gonna need
permission first.</i>

229
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:15,698
<i>As you try to acquire
your market place,</i>

230
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,788
<i>there's probably gonna
be someone already there.</i>

231
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,620
<i>They're not going to share or give
up their territory that easily.</i>

232
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:25,913
They're not going to share
it or give it up. Period.

233
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:27,929
They would definitely
approach you,

234
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:33,877
trying to sell it in an area
without someone's consent.

235
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,170
So I registered with the neighborhood
thugs, and that's how I got on.

236
00:13:37,172 --> 00:13:39,286
Basically, you got to
protect your neighborhood,

237
00:13:39,288 --> 00:13:41,908
and do the things that the
organization require you to do

238
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,704
<i>I remember having
a homicide one day,</i>

239
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:46,981
and they set
this inmate before me.

240
00:13:46,983 --> 00:13:52,257
<i>Two seconds into the conversation, I
realize I used to play with this kid</i>

241
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:53,433
<i>and knew his brothers.</i>

242
00:13:53,435 --> 00:13:57,363
"How'd you get in here?"
He said, "Well, I'm in here for homicide."

243
00:13:57,365 --> 00:14:01,261
He says, "Well, I was in the game.
I was in the game.

244
00:14:01,263 --> 00:14:04,252
"And in an alley
behind Callow Street,

245
00:14:04,254 --> 00:14:07,041
"I had to do what I had to do,
and I ended up taking someone's life

246
00:14:07,043 --> 00:14:11,510
"defending myself because
I had to defend my territory

247
00:14:11,512 --> 00:14:13,895
"and my business."

248
00:14:13,692 --> 00:14:16,949
<i>So now you know what it takes to make
it on the street in the open market.</i>

249
00:14:16,951 --> 00:14:20,309
But prices for drugs nowadays are way
cheaper than when Big John was selling,

250
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:22,192
<i>and the risks are just as high.</i>

251
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,208
<i>If you don't wind up
getting killed by rivals,</i>

252
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,820
<i>or hooked on your own product,</i>

253
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:31,297
<i>In today's drug market, you're risking
your life for less than minimum wage.</i>

254
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:35,261
If you want to go for the real money,
you got to get off the corner.

255
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:49,074
<i>Detroit. City of opportunity.</i>

256
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:52,736
<i>Once upon a time, the symbol
of America's might and power.</i>

257
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:55,055
<i>The heart of our
manufacturing industry.</i>

258
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:57,374
<i>The home of the American Dream.</i>

259
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:06,479
<i>One of the highest unemployment
rates in the nation.</i>

260
00:15:06,481 --> 00:15:10,847
<i>Twenty-five percent of the population
has left in the last 10 years.</i>

261
00:15:10,849 --> 00:15:16,021
<i>For those without a job or who
can't move, they need to hustle.</i>

262
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,620
<i>Mr. X wants to get out of the downward
spiral that's hit Detroit today.</i>

263
00:15:20,596 --> 00:15:22,510
<i>And he's going to tell you
what that means.</i>

264
00:15:22,512 --> 00:15:27,617
<i>or coke, or whatever the fuck
they're selling that's illegal.</i>

265
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:29,633
<i>Because that's the only way out.</i>

266
00:15:29,635 --> 00:15:32,960
<i>I have a lot of bills.
I got rent to pay.</i>

267
00:15:32,962 --> 00:15:36,857
<i>But don't nobody really care
about your problems, man.</i>

268
00:15:36,859 --> 00:15:40,183
<i>You got to have the money, so,
welcome to the cocaine game.</i>

269
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,350
<i>I rarely show
my face on the scene.</i>

270
00:15:44,352 --> 00:15:46,434
<i>Oh, man, I play
the phone game, man.</i>

271
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:49,021
<i>Switch up my phones.
Keeps me off the corner.</i>

272
00:15:58,531 --> 00:16:01,150
<i>Uh, what is it that you want?</i>

273
00:16:05,922 --> 00:16:07,871
<i>Yeah I can get you a T for 70.</i>

274
00:16:07,873 --> 00:16:10,222
Okay, cool.
I'll see you in 30 minutes. Bye.

275
00:16:10,224 --> 00:16:11,365
<i>Bye.</i>

276
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:13,515
<i>And bam.</i>

277
00:16:13,517 --> 00:16:15,028
<i>That's how you win.</i>

278
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:19,093
<i>Shit, I'll be damned
if somebody tell me,</i>

279
00:16:19,095 --> 00:16:23,427
<i>"You got us working eight hours
for fucking $60, $70, man."</i>

280
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:25,612
<i>That's crazy.
That's too much work.</i>

281
00:16:25,614 --> 00:16:27,426
<i>I just made that shit
in a phone call.</i>

282
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:29,644
<i>The American Dream is
just to have enough money</i>

283
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:32,701
<i>to be able to do whatever you want
to do, whenever you want to do it,</i>

284
00:16:32,703 --> 00:16:35,322
<i>based on your own hard work.</i>

285
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:37,374
<i>Shit, just what I have on the
counter would probably get me</i>

286
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:40,129
<i>anywhere from 10 years
to about 15 years.</i>

287
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:45,438
<i>I'd rather be out here getting
it than not getting it at all,</i>

288
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,478
<i>I've been really trying to free
myself, use the coke to free myself.</i>

289
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,274
<i>As a private cocaine dealer, you'll
be mostly selling Ts and eight balls,</i>

290
00:16:54,276 --> 00:16:58,676
<i>sixteenth or eighth of an ounce little
baggies for up to 150 bucks a pop.</i>

291
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:00,762
<i>Ramping up to 20
customers a day is easy.</i>

292
00:17:00,764 --> 00:17:04,055
<i>You'll be paying $500 for
your day's worth of cocaine,</i>

293
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:06,475
<i>and you'll cut it in
half with baby laxative,</i>

294
00:17:06,477 --> 00:17:10,843
<i>which brings your profit to a total of a
grand a day, and you just got started.</i>

295
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:14,270
<i>Fiends from outside
into your home.</i>

296
00:17:14,272 --> 00:17:21,561
<i>They might bring the police with them,
with the wire taps and everything.</i>

297
00:17:21,563 --> 00:17:27,240
<i>Man, they try to get as close to you as
possible, and you keep them at a distance.</i>

298
00:17:27,242 --> 00:17:29,491
<i>But you got to keep
that friendship with them.</i>

299
00:17:29,493 --> 00:17:32,448
<i>You can't be like, aggressive
with your customers.</i>

300
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:37,287
<i>You got to treat them fair, you got
to treat them like regular people.</i>

301
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:41,352
<i>Man, a stash spot
is stashed away, hidden.</i>

302
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:45,351
<i>Get that shit out the house,
keep it out the house.</i>

303
00:17:45,353 --> 00:17:47,535
<i>Don't let nobody come
to the house to buy it.</i>

304
00:17:47,537 --> 00:17:52,541
<i>I wouldn't put my money anywhere
that someone else can control it.</i>

305
00:17:52,543 --> 00:17:56,708
<i>It'd be best to hide that
wherever you put your dope at.</i>

306
00:17:57,685 --> 00:18:00,439
<i>You get about 500,000
or something like that.</i>

307
00:18:00,441 --> 00:18:04,202
<i>Start me a couple businesses, man,
get right up out of this shit.</i>

308
00:18:04,204 --> 00:18:07,495
<i>If you decide that you ever
want to pick up this game,</i>

309
00:18:07,497 --> 00:18:11,124
<i>shit, pick it up for the right
reason, the money only.</i>

310
00:18:11,126 --> 00:18:14,349
<i>Save from the time that you get it
to the time that you quit, man.</i>

311
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:16,433
<i>And you won't be in it so long.</i>

312
00:18:16,435 --> 00:18:18,583
<i>If you choose
to be a cocaine dealer,</i>

313
00:18:18,586 --> 00:18:24,732
If you're black, you're about four times as
likely to be arrested than a white dealer,

314
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:30,310
<i>because white Americans buy and
sell more cocaine than anyone else.</i>

315
00:18:30,312 --> 00:18:33,670
It's the circumstances to where they're
actually setting up to sell the drugs,

316
00:18:33,672 --> 00:18:37,332
See, the black drug dealers
will be in the neighborhoods

317
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:41,029
where the law enforcement will search
people without very much reasoning.

318
00:18:41,031 --> 00:18:43,011
I mean, my first case,
it was like a fluke.

319
00:18:43,013 --> 00:18:48,387
He, uh, ran where we're at.
I happened to be just standing outside,

320
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:50,370
and the police say,
"Get up against the fence."

321
00:18:50,372 --> 00:18:53,460
And I'm like, "Man, come on,
why I got to get up against the fence?"

322
00:18:53,462 --> 00:18:54,536
"Shut up."

323
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:56,652
Next thing you know,

324
00:18:56,655 --> 00:18:58,837
they pulled this
big brick out my pocket.

325
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,920
So, that was the beginning
of the end, right there.

326
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:03,103
<i>You're not only more
likely to be arrested,</i>

327
00:19:03,105 --> 00:19:05,591
<i>but prosecuted,
with heavy prison time.</i>

328
00:19:05,293 --> 00:19:09,860
The reason that 94.5%
of people incarcerated

329
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:12,313
under the Rockefeller Drug
Laws are black and brown

330
00:19:12,315 --> 00:19:14,027
is that's the way
the DA's operate.

331
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:16,782
<i>Business mogul
Russell Simmons spent years</i>

332
00:19:16,784 --> 00:19:20,444
<i>lobbying against the harsh Rockefeller
Drug Laws of New York City,</i>

333
00:19:20,446 --> 00:19:24,107
which treated the non-violent crime
of drug dealing the same as murder.

334
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:26,358
I mean, imagine you're a model.

335
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,609
You know, a fashion model. You
know, like some blonde girl.

336
00:19:28,611 --> 00:19:30,760
It doesn't matter where you're
from, you're not going to jail.

337
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:32,138
And if you're some guy
from the hood,

338
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,154
maybe you'll go
to jail for 20 years.

339
00:19:34,156 --> 00:19:36,841
Hell, they tried
to give me 45 years.

340
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:41,007
So, I did a lot of time. I did, like
five years, spring something like that.

341
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:45,411
And a white drug dealer will be in middle
America, somewhere in the suburbs.

342
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:51,090
That isn't in a space where he can just be
searched for no reason at all or go to jail.

343
00:19:51,092 --> 00:19:54,550
<i>Curtis Jackson, Russell
Simmons, and many others</i>

344
00:19:54,552 --> 00:19:56,500
<i>have successfully
persuaded New York</i>

345
00:19:56,502 --> 00:19:59,758
<i>to reduce some of their
harsh sentencing practices.</i>

346
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,180
<i>But 90% of those
convicted on drug charges</i>

347
00:20:02,182 --> 00:20:05,506
<i>are still African-American
and Latino.</i>

348
00:20:05,508 --> 00:20:07,422
<i>Like they say for any business,</i>

349
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:11,320
<i>the golden rule, location,
location, location.</i>

350
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:15,095
<i>I didn't care if people
knew where I lived.</i>

351
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:17,581
People would just come to my
house, and I would go outside

352
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,504
and just give them the gram, and we
would do the transaction that way.

353
00:20:20,506 --> 00:20:25,310
In 2003, I was the main coke dealer
for all the private schools in L.A.

354
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:30,148
<i>If you're gonna be a private coke
dealer, this is the way to go.</i>

355
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,727
<i>In a nice, suburban neighborhood,</i>

356
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:34,751
<i>selling to the largest
cocaine market directly.</i>

357
00:20:34,754 --> 00:20:39,488
<i>and already knew where to buy
cocaine for him and his friends.</i>

358
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:42,816
<i>So, he was in a perfect position
to go into business for himself.</i>

359
00:20:42,818 --> 00:20:45,033
<i>What's going on
through my head is,</i>

360
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,821
<i>just start selling drugs
to support my habit</i>

361
00:20:47,823 --> 00:20:50,779
<i>and to support the
lifestyle that I wanted.</i>

362
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:53,937
People want drugs,
so I can sell drugs.

363
00:20:53,939 --> 00:20:55,852
'Cause I know where
to get it already.

364
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,104
My first rock was about this big,

365
00:20:58,106 --> 00:21:00,724
and I remember
showing my friends this.

366
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:05,865
They were like, "No fucking way you have
this big of a rock with you right now,

367
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:07,512
"like, this is insane."

368
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:14,030
<i>It was like,
"This is awesome, this is exciting."</i>

369
00:21:16,096 --> 00:21:20,329
The stories that grew out of me being
a coke dealer just went from this

370
00:21:20,331 --> 00:21:24,361
to like, you know, this, and I was
suddenly, you know, the guy...

371
00:21:24,363 --> 00:21:26,344
You know, that everyone's
talking about,

372
00:21:26,346 --> 00:21:29,536
<i>I threw a party at
the L'Ermitage hotel,</i>

373
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,753
and I got, like,
the Penthouse suite.

374
00:21:31,755 --> 00:21:34,441
<i>I've always wanted
to be loved and accepted.</i>

375
00:21:34,443 --> 00:21:37,801
And that's what selling coke gave me.
It gave me that power,

376
00:21:37,803 --> 00:21:40,288
it gave me the feeling
of acceptance.

377
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,178
It was definitely addictive
to be a drug dealer.

378
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,436
Not only the money
that you got from it,

379
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,688
<i>but the way people
talked about you,</i>

380
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,854
the way people looked at you,
the power that I felt from it.

381
00:21:52,856 --> 00:21:57,625
I just liked having money. It gave
me security, it made me feel good.

382
00:21:57,627 --> 00:22:00,380
People don't know what's a
gram, and what's not a gram,

383
00:22:00,382 --> 00:22:02,061
they've never seen
coke before in their life.

384
00:22:02,063 --> 00:22:05,018
<i>The market rate for a gram
was about $50 for coke,</i>

385
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,101
but if you're a rich girl
who didn't know anything,

386
00:22:07,103 --> 00:22:12,141
I would probably sell you
.5 for about $60 to $75.

387
00:22:12,143 --> 00:22:15,501
<i>A guy like Mike makes half as
much as our Detroit dealer,</i>

388
00:22:15,503 --> 00:22:18,828
<i>working half as hard, but with
virtually none of the risk.</i>

389
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:22,087
The word got out that I have
coke, and I'm selling coke.

390
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,552
The dean in the school,
they pulled me in,

391
00:22:24,554 --> 00:22:28,215
and they said, "Hey look, you know,
we're hearing that you're selling drugs,

392
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:30,567
"and we want to do a drug test on you."

393
00:22:30,569 --> 00:22:32,953
So, at that point, you
know, I thought to myself,

394
00:22:32,955 --> 00:22:37,186
"Well, I better really slow down on this
and not do it anymore."

395
00:22:37,188 --> 00:22:38,597
<i>Mike failed his drug test,</i>

396
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:41,655
and was kicked out of school,
but never did any hard time.

397
00:22:42,664 --> 00:22:45,217
<i>When dealing small amounts,
the nicer the neighborhood,</i>

398
00:22:45,219 --> 00:22:47,300
<i>the less chance of getting busted.</i>

399
00:22:47,302 --> 00:22:52,609
<i>it'll still take years to get that
mansion in the hills you want.</i>

400
00:22:52,611 --> 00:22:55,566
<i>To be a big time player,
you need to get committed.</i>

401
00:22:55,568 --> 00:22:57,716
<i>It's time to start
building a business.</i>

402
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:08,708
Instead of selling ounces,
I started selling keys.

403
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,900
<i>A key is a kilo of cocaine.</i>

404
00:23:11,902 --> 00:23:14,992
<i>A single kilo can run
you about $20,000.</i>

405
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:17,242
I had what I believe was skills.

406
00:23:17,244 --> 00:23:21,106
<i>This is Skipp. He did really
well as a corner hustler.</i>

407
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:25,307
I had the skills to sit on the
wall and make about $8,000 a day.

408
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:28,499
<i>Once you've stacked up enough money,
you can buy larger quantities</i>

409
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:32,363
<i>and supply dealers yourself, which is
what Skipp's gonna teach you to do.</i>

410
00:23:32,365 --> 00:23:36,462
<i>I was 10 or 11 years old, my
family life was dysfunctional.</i>

411
00:23:36,464 --> 00:23:39,285
My mother worked two jobs,
my father wasn't in the home,

412
00:23:39,287 --> 00:23:41,166
<i>so before drugs came
into the community,</i>

413
00:23:41,168 --> 00:23:45,602
lot of people who would hustle would
rob banks or rob jewelry stores.

414
00:23:45,604 --> 00:23:47,953
<i>The aggression, the
violence wasn't for me.</i>

415
00:23:47,955 --> 00:23:49,936
<i>Skipp was struggling
to make ends meet</i>

416
00:23:49,938 --> 00:23:54,674
<i>in order to protect himself from the
Crips bullying his neighborhood.</i>

417
00:23:54,676 --> 00:23:58,437
<i>but it was the relationships
I had with the Crips</i>

418
00:23:58,439 --> 00:24:01,226
<i>that actually
introduced me to drugs.</i>

419
00:24:01,228 --> 00:24:04,552
<i>I saw them having money, and I was
asking them what are they doing,</i>

420
00:24:04,554 --> 00:24:07,643
and the more I hung out with them, I
got more into the culture of drugs.

421
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:09,727
<i>We used to go to, uh,
different areas</i>

422
00:24:09,729 --> 00:24:12,314
<i>that weren't populated
by the L.A. culture</i>

423
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:14,699
<i>so they wanted it, but they
didn't have the connection,</i>

424
00:24:14,701 --> 00:24:17,321
<i>so we would come out
and be that connection.</i>

425
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:20,781
You'd have to have, uh, a
family contact or a friend.

426
00:24:20,783 --> 00:24:22,630
<i>I myself went to Las Vegas.</i>

427
00:24:22,632 --> 00:24:25,451
There are more than a hundred
street gangs in Los Angeles.

428
00:24:25,453 --> 00:24:27,770
Police now say they have
become heavily involved

429
00:24:27,772 --> 00:24:31,298
in the drug trade, exporting their
crimes throughout the west.

430
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,322
Going out of town when people
knew you were from L.A.,

431
00:24:34,324 --> 00:24:36,641
that number one,
made you a star celebrity.

432
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:40,068
And then, if you were the
guy who had the drugs,

433
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,622
it made you an even
bigger celebrity.

434
00:24:42,624 --> 00:24:46,755
Made all the girls love
and want to come to you.

435
00:24:46,757 --> 00:24:49,107
The difficult part became
how to get it out of town.

436
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:54,547
<i>I myself would always
buy a bucket.</i>

437
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:59,285
Put whatever I want inside of it
and go get a girl who likes me.

438
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:01,738
Don't tell her what's in the
car, and let her drive it.

439
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,586
Did the girls
ever get pulled over?

440
00:25:03,588 --> 00:25:06,845
Nah, I've been fortunate that
that has never occurred.

441
00:25:06,847 --> 00:25:10,507
Um, however, they did get pregnant,
and I now have children.

442
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,658
The relationships that
I wanted for a weekend

443
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,145
have lasted longer
than I expected.

444
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:17,732
<i>A lot of smugglers get
someone else to drive.</i>

445
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:19,883
<i>But how do you keep
track of you driver?</i>

446
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,907
The DEA make a living
chasing drugs across country.

447
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:29,224
<i>So they can tell you how the smartest
suppliers keep track of their cargo.</i>

448
00:25:29,226 --> 00:25:36,145
<i>the source of supply had rigged
this car with a GPS locator</i>

449
00:25:35,554 --> 00:25:39,046
<i>and a phone, so he could
actually dial into the phone</i>

450
00:25:39,048 --> 00:25:43,616
and he could monitor if the transaction
was going correctly or not.

451
00:25:43,618 --> 00:25:45,767
He would know if the vehicle
was out of position.

452
00:25:45,769 --> 00:25:48,253
<i>Now, you don't want to put
your drugs in the trunk.</i>

453
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,740
<i>You're going to want some new
options on your vehicle.</i>

454
00:25:50,742 --> 00:25:54,536
<i>Designing "traps" is standard practice
for any local chop shop.</i>

455
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,871
It's kind of like
a combination safe.

456
00:25:58,873 --> 00:26:01,391
It has to be a series of things
activated in the vehicle

457
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:06,330
<i>Like, they may have to have the air
conditioning on, the blinker on,</i>

458
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:09,656
and a couple of other things within
the vehicle for it to activate.

459
00:26:09,658 --> 00:26:11,438
You got money to spend,
you'll get a real good trap.

460
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,756
We've seen some sloppy
ones, this is good work.

461
00:26:13,758 --> 00:26:16,443
When they're closed, you would never
know by looking at it with your eye

462
00:26:16,445 --> 00:26:20,510
so whoever constructed this
one was a professional.

463
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,064
It goes the whole length
of the back seat area.

464
00:26:23,066 --> 00:26:26,020
So you could fit probably
in excess of 10 kilograms

465
00:26:26,022 --> 00:26:29,481
of, uh, narcotics, large amounts
of currency or weapons.

466
00:26:29,283 --> 00:26:32,305
<i>Now you're ready.
But before you hit the road,</i>

467
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:35,463
<i>Pepe has some tips from back in the
day when he was running cocaine.</i>

468
00:26:38,455 --> 00:26:40,470
Get up in the morning,
you be ready.

469
00:26:40,472 --> 00:26:43,460
Check your car, no lights broke.

470
00:26:43,462 --> 00:26:46,921
Insure your car, everything.

471
00:26:46,923 --> 00:26:49,508
Even the speed limit.

472
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:52,129
25? 25. No more.

473
00:26:52,131 --> 00:26:54,145
75? 75. You know?

474
00:26:54,147 --> 00:26:56,699
15, school? 15, school.

475
00:26:56,701 --> 00:26:58,479
Take it easy.

476
00:26:59,524 --> 00:27:02,815
And you get there. You be there.

477
00:27:02,817 --> 00:27:05,166
<i>So how much does
a smuggler expect to make?</i>

478
00:27:05,168 --> 00:27:10,105
If they take 10 kilos, they give
me $4,000 just to smuggle it,

479
00:27:10,107 --> 00:27:14,809
or if it was more?
5,000. It all depends.

480
00:27:15,854 --> 00:27:18,709
<i>So you've driven a few
kilos across country,</i>

481
00:27:18,711 --> 00:27:22,137
<i>you might be making
mid six figures a year.</i>

482
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:27,546
<i>Once you're in the game, you realize
just how many people want drugs.</i>

483
00:27:27,548 --> 00:27:31,780
There's everybody from the Wall Street
types to the people on the streets,

484
00:27:31,782 --> 00:27:35,241
to kids going to concerts,
the stoners.

485
00:27:35,243 --> 00:27:37,089
Everybody wanted cocaine.

486
00:27:37,091 --> 00:27:39,608
<i>What domestic smugglers
make in a month,</i>

487
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,094
<i>Bobby Carlton would
eventually make in a day.</i>

488
00:27:47,394 --> 00:27:50,719
<i>In the 70s, all the cocaine was
coming in through South Florida,</i>

489
00:27:50,721 --> 00:27:57,204
<i>and uh, back then they used to
call it the South Florida shuffle.</i>

490
00:27:57,206 --> 00:28:01,202
<i>Everybody and anybody was selling
drugs, running drugs, moving drugs.</i>

491
00:28:01,204 --> 00:28:05,369
<i>They were coming in, and
they were going everywhere.</i>

492
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:09,200
<i>The posses buy cocaine
for about $5,000 a kilo.</i>

493
00:28:09,202 --> 00:28:11,787
<i>The drugs are then brought here to
Miami, where they're divided up</i>

494
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:14,610
<i>and shipped all over
the United States.</i>

495
00:28:14,612 --> 00:28:19,381
<i>The initial $5,000 investment
is worth $125,000.</i>

496
00:28:19,383 --> 00:28:22,639
<i>A girl that we had known, me and
some friends, we had gone over</i>

497
00:28:22,641 --> 00:28:28,486
<i>to her house for a party, and I went with
her into her garage, and I was shocked.</i>

498
00:28:28,488 --> 00:28:32,686
<i>There was boxes and boxes of
cash just all over the garage,</i>

499
00:28:32,688 --> 00:28:34,702
<i>and it was just packed with money.</i>

500
00:28:34,704 --> 00:28:37,995
I just looked at her and I said,
"Look I don't care what you're into,

501
00:28:37,997 --> 00:28:40,515
<i>"or how you do it, I want in."</i>

502
00:28:40,517 --> 00:28:42,632
And she introduced me to somebody,

503
00:28:42,634 --> 00:28:44,917
and, uh, that somebody
put me on a boat.

504
00:28:51,638 --> 00:28:54,526
The way it works is their
drop-off point is Bimini.

505
00:28:54,528 --> 00:28:57,517
<i>Bimini's literally like 70 miles
off the coast of Florida.</i>

506
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,231
<i>You can go to Bimini, load up,</i>

507
00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:03,734
<i>"Go fast boats" are called
go fast boats for a reason.</i>

508
00:29:03,736 --> 00:29:07,127
<i>These, like, Colombian
cats hedge their bets.</i>

509
00:29:07,129 --> 00:29:10,958
<i>What they do is they send about
15 to 20 of them at a time.</i>

510
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,838
<i>the odds of getting arrested are
very slim, the money's very good.</i>

511
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,928
<i>You get into Fort Lauderdale
or you get into Miami,</i>

512
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:24,767
<i>and uh, you drop a boat off, and you
get a bunch of cash and that was it.</i>

513
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:28,429
<i>When you're 18 years old and you
come from a very poor family,</i>

514
00:29:28,431 --> 00:29:31,386
<i>like stuff's just not happening
for you, that's a lot of money.</i>

515
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:42,334
<i>Fifty grand a day
would satisfy most people.</i>

516
00:29:42,336 --> 00:29:44,685
<i>But not Brian O'Dea.</i>

517
00:29:44,687 --> 00:29:49,994
<i>Brian was one of the most notorious
drug smugglers in the world.</i>

518
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:55,639
<i>He and his 120 employees would
take in over $100 million a year.</i>

519
00:29:55,641 --> 00:29:58,193
<i>Brian's going to show you
how a college dropout</i>

520
00:29:58,195 --> 00:30:02,561
<i>can become the CEO of a major
import-export business.</i>

521
00:30:02,563 --> 00:30:05,081
I sent two pounds of hash
to myself from England.

522
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:08,542
I got 19 months for that,
and went to prison.

523
00:30:08,544 --> 00:30:13,045
When I got out of prison, I had
no money and nothing going on.

524
00:30:13,047 --> 00:30:15,094
<i>So, I thought,
maybe I can kick start</i>

525
00:30:15,096 --> 00:30:18,354
<i>my getting back into the
world with a little coke.</i>

526
00:30:18,356 --> 00:30:22,351
I had $500 in my pocket,
and an address.

527
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:25,275
Couldn't speak a word of Spanish,
but figured I could figure it out,

528
00:30:25,277 --> 00:30:26,820
so I took off to Colombia,

529
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,928
and I said,
"Do you know, uh, Benny?"

530
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,347
Showing him my card
with Benny's name on it.

531
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:37,775
I won't say his last name right now.
I might get myself shot.

532
00:30:37,777 --> 00:30:40,126
So the guy, he said,
"What do you want?"

533
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,403
I went like that,

534
00:30:41,405 --> 00:30:43,990
and I said
"Well, I got $500 with me."

535
00:30:43,992 --> 00:30:46,913
And, you know, everybody started
crying laughing, right.

536
00:30:46,915 --> 00:30:49,064
I told him I just
got out of prison,

537
00:30:49,066 --> 00:30:52,491
I got my hands on... That's
all I could get my hands on,

538
00:30:52,493 --> 00:30:54,575
and I'm just trying
to get a life started.

539
00:30:54,577 --> 00:30:57,262
<i>So he said,
"Senor, muchos huevos."</i>

540
00:30:57,264 --> 00:30:59,211
He thought I had a lot of balls.

541
00:30:59,213 --> 00:31:01,496
He said,
"I'm gonna get you 50 grams of coke.

542
00:31:01,498 --> 00:31:04,487
"You can cut it in half
'cause I'll give it to you pure.

543
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:07,377
"You should be able to get about
10 grand out of that back there

544
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:08,485
"if you sell it in grams."

545
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:09,444
I don't know where
I came up with this,

546
00:31:09,446 --> 00:31:12,132
but I got a pin, and I
heated it with a lighter,

547
00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:15,424
and you can put a hot pin
under this cellophane here,

548
00:31:15,426 --> 00:31:17,608
and that will pop open.

549
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,632
So, then you can slide the
cigarettes right out of the pack

550
00:31:20,634 --> 00:31:22,480
without breaking the seal.

551
00:31:22,482 --> 00:31:26,748
The 50 grams of coke
fit into this pack

552
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,638
like it was made
to fit into that pack.

553
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,662
I thought,
"Ah, this is brilliant!"

554
00:31:32,664 --> 00:31:35,014
I put the cigarettes with
the coke in it in my pocket

555
00:31:35,016 --> 00:31:36,660
with the pack I was smoking.

556
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:39,684
Leaving Colombia, you have
to go through immigration.

557
00:31:39,686 --> 00:31:42,708
There's no just going
and getting on the plane.

558
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:47,580
So, I'm going through immigration, there
are two guys there, and they go...

559
00:31:47,582 --> 00:31:51,445
"On behalf of the Unites States Government,
we're checking all people

560
00:31:51,447 --> 00:31:54,839
"who fit a profile,
who seem to be involved with drugs..."

561
00:31:54,841 --> 00:31:59,206
I said, "Are you kidding me?
I'm a reporter! I'm a journalist!"

562
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:05,053
But they said, "We still have to
take your clothes off, please,

563
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:06,767
"and get your suitcases off the plane."

564
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:09,925
I'm going,
"No! I'm not taking my..."

565
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:12,680
"Sir, there's nothing we can do about it.
You have to."

566
00:32:12,682 --> 00:32:14,696
I take my pants off,
still have my jacket on.

567
00:32:14,698 --> 00:32:18,157
I pass them my pants, cursing
and swearing, and my socks,

568
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,113
and I reach my hand
into my jacket pocket.

569
00:32:21,116 --> 00:32:24,373
I put the cigarettes I was holding
the coke in on the bottom

570
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,095
and the cigarettes I was smoking
on the top, and I flipped it open,

571
00:32:27,097 --> 00:32:30,085
the one I was smoking, pulled
out a cigarette and lit it.

572
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:32,236
Offered them a cigarette,
which they each took.

573
00:32:32,238 --> 00:32:35,260
I mean, these guys are making 30
bucks a month, we can't forget.

574
00:32:35,262 --> 00:32:37,981
I'm lighting their cigarettes,
and I take my jacket off

575
00:32:37,983 --> 00:32:39,830
and hand it to them, and my shirt,

576
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:44,399
holding the cigarettes and the
coke in my hand the entire time.

577
00:32:44,401 --> 00:32:50,245
The moment they handed me back a piece of
clothing that had a pocket in it, shwamp!

578
00:32:50,247 --> 00:32:53,538
I immediately stuffed
the coke back in the pocket.

579
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:58,141
And that's how I got
in the coke business.

580
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:01,737
<i>After that, Brian O'Dea
was in business.</i>

581
00:33:04,225 --> 00:33:09,533
He got a small amount of coke, and he dissolved
it in water, and then poured in material.

582
00:33:09,535 --> 00:33:13,732
<i>What we used were ponchos, or ruanas
as they're called in Colombia.</i>

583
00:33:12,734 --> 00:33:16,294
So, here we now had this piece of material
that had a couple of grams of coke in it,

584
00:33:16,296 --> 00:33:19,553
and then I just folded up those ponchos
buddy, put them in my suitcase,

585
00:33:19,555 --> 00:33:22,812
and headed on a direct flight to L.A.
from Bogota.

586
00:33:22,814 --> 00:33:28,289
You just soak it in the water, and
then evaporate the water off. Simple.

587
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:31,448
Of course, methanol is what you should
be doing it with, and not water,

588
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,968
'cause methanol evaporates
off at room temperature.

589
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,589
Water, you got to wait forever
for the shit to evaporate,

590
00:33:36,591 --> 00:33:38,437
which is, you know...
It's a learning process.

591
00:33:43,747 --> 00:33:46,837
<i>If these individuals were
putting their expertise</i>

592
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,517
<i>towards a legitimate goal,</i>

593
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:51,810
could probably be very
wealthy as entrepreneurs.

594
00:33:51,812 --> 00:33:55,640
We have seized drugs
in prosthetic legs,

595
00:33:55,642 --> 00:33:59,739
heroin in kidney beans,
in the back of paintings.

596
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:10,156
Individuals swallow condoms filled with heroin.
Heroin pellets, we call them.

597
00:34:10,158 --> 00:34:13,046
Once that condom breaks open
or that balloon breaks open,

598
00:34:13,048 --> 00:34:17,178
there's not much anyone's going to
be able to do to save your life.

599
00:34:19,364 --> 00:34:22,352
<i>A million dollars in a few
months is a lot of money.</i>

600
00:34:22,354 --> 00:34:25,041
<i>But how would you like to
make that in a few days?</i>

601
00:34:25,043 --> 00:34:27,930
<i>Everyone dreams of climbing to
the top of the game one day.</i>

602
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:32,736
Some people can play baseball,
basketball, or sing, or dance.

603
00:34:36,197 --> 00:34:39,926
With some of the icons being
millionaires from selling drugs,

604
00:34:39,928 --> 00:34:42,211
of course, I wanted...
I didn't want to be like Mike.

605
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,227
I didn't want to be like Michael
Jordan or Magic Johnson,

606
00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:45,403
I wanted to be like...

607
00:34:45,405 --> 00:34:46,848
I wanted to be like Freeway Rick!

608
00:34:47,923 --> 00:34:50,342
<i>My name is Freeway Rick Ross.</i>

609
00:34:50,344 --> 00:34:53,266
My claim to fame
is being a drug kingpin.

610
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,828
At that time, I never did
drugs, I had never smoked weed.

611
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:03,592
<i>I was going to a junior college playing
tennis when my car was broken down.</i>

612
00:35:03,594 --> 00:35:05,473
I was in financial
ruins at the time.

613
00:35:05,475 --> 00:35:06,649
I needed some money.

614
00:35:06,651 --> 00:35:08,901
Narcotics is
a thing of the future.

615
00:35:08,903 --> 00:35:10,681
If we don't get
a piece of that action,

616
00:35:10,683 --> 00:35:14,142
we risk everything we have.
I mean, not now, but 10 years from now.

617
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:16,494
When they put those movies
out, that made us curious.

618
00:35:16,496 --> 00:35:18,242
<i>I mean it was almost like
being a movie star.</i>

619
00:35:18,244 --> 00:35:20,560
<i>You know, how people
wished to be movie stars.</i>

620
00:35:20,562 --> 00:35:22,307
That was the way I felt
about cocaine.

621
00:35:24,325 --> 00:35:29,262
<i>We went to the movie, it might
have been 15 or 20 of us.</i>

622
00:35:32,018 --> 00:35:33,664
And we were all curious.

623
00:35:33,666 --> 00:35:36,284
Most of the older people were
saying, you know, that, uh...

624
00:35:36,286 --> 00:35:39,006
"You can't make any money
in South Central off of cocaine."

625
00:35:39,008 --> 00:35:42,769
What I found out is that the PCP
dealers made so much money for PCP,

626
00:35:42,771 --> 00:35:45,189
they had the money, and they
became my first customers.

627
00:35:46,802 --> 00:35:49,221
<i>We just kept escalating
and escalating</i>

628
00:35:49,223 --> 00:35:52,917
until my mom found out
and put me out the house.

629
00:35:52,919 --> 00:35:56,848
I was ghetto-rich at that time so I had
plenty of places that I could move.

630
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:00,209
<i>The trick to becoming a kingpin
in any industry is innovation.</i>

631
00:36:00,211 --> 00:36:03,199
<i>Freeway Rick introduced
crack to the West Coast.</i>

632
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:06,424
When people snort cocaine, they snort
so much their nose start bleeding.

633
00:36:06,426 --> 00:36:09,113
So, they needed another way
to get it into their systems.

634
00:36:09,115 --> 00:36:10,557
People would come by
early in the morning,

635
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:13,648
you know, like, doctors and
nurses and truck drivers.

636
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,235
They want to get some,
and they want to smoke it.

637
00:36:16,237 --> 00:36:20,267
They started saying stuff like,
"Man, I wish it was ready to go already."

638
00:36:20,269 --> 00:36:23,595
So we got hip, and we started
cooking it up for them,

639
00:36:23,597 --> 00:36:27,795
so we would have the powder
here and the Ready Rock here.

640
00:36:27,797 --> 00:36:31,289
Eventually, everybody started
wanting it, uh, Ready Rocked.

641
00:36:32,432 --> 00:36:35,556
<i>For one minute, it was
like, in South Central,</i>

642
00:36:35,558 --> 00:36:39,420
<i>then it moved to Inglewood,
then it moved to West L.A.</i>

643
00:36:39,422 --> 00:36:42,545
<i>Then it moved to Compton,
then it moved to Watts,</i>

644
00:36:42,285 --> 00:36:44,265
it's like a virus.

645
00:36:44,267 --> 00:36:47,390
Pretty much every day I could do a
million dollars' worth of drugs.

646
00:36:47,392 --> 00:36:50,582
There was days that I would go to
two and three million dollars.

647
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:55,656
<i>I gave a lot of money away.</i>

648
00:36:55,658 --> 00:36:58,377
I mean, that's part of,
you know, being successful,

649
00:36:58,379 --> 00:37:00,662
so that you can help your
family and friends, you know.

650
00:37:00,664 --> 00:37:02,544
<i>Somebody would come up to
your house when it was due,</i>

651
00:37:02,546 --> 00:37:06,173
<i>car notes, light bills,
you know, friends in jail.</i>

652
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:08,160
<i>So much stuff... You know, just
give to kids on the street.</i>

653
00:37:08,162 --> 00:37:11,352
I mean, it's a good feeling when you
can help somebody else, you know.

654
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,805
One of the best feelings
that you can have, so...

655
00:37:13,807 --> 00:37:18,979
I probably used to take about $40,000 a
day around with me just to give out.

656
00:37:18,981 --> 00:37:22,036
You know, 'cause people be coming up
to me all day, anyway, to see me.

657
00:37:22,038 --> 00:37:24,793
So, you know, you got to give
it to them if you see them.

658
00:37:24,795 --> 00:37:27,245
<i>When you're a kingpin,
word travels fast.</i>

659
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:30,000
<i>Like Pablo Escobar was
to many Colombians.</i>

660
00:37:30,002 --> 00:37:32,050
<i>For communities with
struggling economies,</i>

661
00:37:32,052 --> 00:37:36,317
you are a primary job creator,
community leader, godfather,

662
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:39,308
<i>bank and charitable organization.</i>

663
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:44,180
You know, if I was in trouble, I would
want somebody to give me a helping hand.

664
00:37:48,876 --> 00:37:51,564
When you're this high profile,
there's enormous pressure

665
00:37:51,566 --> 00:37:54,084
<i>on law enforcement to make a bust.</i>

666
00:37:54,086 --> 00:37:55,999
<i>And if your operation is tight,</i>

667
00:37:56,001 --> 00:37:58,116
<i>collecting evidence
can be nearly impossible.</i>

668
00:37:58,118 --> 00:38:02,148
<i>That's when Meltin puts a bag of
marijuana into Ferral's pocket.</i>

669
00:38:10,718 --> 00:38:13,741
<i>California Judge Jim Gray
can explain their thinking.</i>

670
00:38:13,743 --> 00:38:17,369
"I know this fellow may have been
involved with drugs before,

671
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:19,419
"so I'll plant some on him now.

672
00:38:19,421 --> 00:38:22,074
"So, he's good for it from before,
maybe not this time,

673
00:38:22,076 --> 00:38:26,878
And then, they actually go to
court and they involve themselves

674
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,297
in what they call "testal lying."

675
00:38:29,299 --> 00:38:31,347
<i>And that's how they
busted Freeway Rick.</i>

676
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:34,741
The cops on my case
had planted drugs on me.

677
00:38:34,743 --> 00:38:36,454
I pled guilty to 10 years.

678
00:38:44,034 --> 00:38:46,419
<i>So, knowing the cops are going
to arrest you at some point</i>

679
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:49,913
<i>no matter how good you are,
what can you do?</i>

680
00:38:49,915 --> 00:38:53,542
<i>The first thing you need to
understand is how drug cases work.</i>

681
00:38:53,544 --> 00:38:57,170
<i>Drug cases are prosecuted
unlike any other criminal case.</i>

682
00:38:57,172 --> 00:38:59,287
<i>Here's a cop and
a lawyer to explain how.</i>

683
00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:04,193
It's impossible for the police
to have a normal procedure

684
00:39:04,195 --> 00:39:06,646
<i>in a crime where
nobody wants to report it.</i>

685
00:39:06,648 --> 00:39:12,056
Nobody calls 911 when they use a
drug, buy a drug, or sell a drug.

686
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:15,584
In traditional law enforcement,
a crime gets committed,

687
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:19,045
police try to find
who committed the crime.

688
00:39:19,047 --> 00:39:21,363
This is the way
drug enforcement works,

689
00:39:21,365 --> 00:39:28,789
you look for a suspect, and then you try
to trick them into committing the crime...

690
00:39:28,791 --> 00:39:30,839
For you!

691
00:39:30,841 --> 00:39:32,451
It's backwards.

692
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,198
So the government
goes around sort of saying,

693
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,148
"Let's find suspect, who should be a...

694
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,398
"Well, let's try to set some fucker up."

695
00:39:40,247 --> 00:39:42,498
<i>Here we are, observing the DEA,</i>

696
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,884
<i>who've arranged to buy
drugs from a suspect.</i>

697
00:39:44,886 --> 00:39:47,302
<i>He's the guy on the right
with the baseball cap.</i>

698
00:39:47,304 --> 00:39:53,284
<i>He's completely surrounded by law
enforcement, and has no idea.</i>

699
00:40:01,651 --> 00:40:04,775
Just chill, just chill. Got any weapons on you?
Anything on you?

700
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,497
Nothing? No guns,
no knives, no drugs?

701
00:40:07,499 --> 00:40:09,614
All right. But just to protect,
do you have anything on you,

702
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:17,208
<i>The reality is that the cops don't
really care too much about this one guy.</i>

703
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:20,836
<i>Their objective is to just use
him to cuff more dealers.</i>

704
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:22,718
We'll lock up this middle man,

705
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,843
hopefully, this middle man will
cooperate and get us the distributor,

706
00:40:25,845 --> 00:40:27,758
and we'll just go up the ladder

707
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,967
and keep going up the food chain.

708
00:40:28,172 --> 00:40:30,051
It's very intimidating
and overwhelming.

709
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:32,571
I'm gonna say to you, you
know, you got a lot to lose,

710
00:40:32,573 --> 00:40:34,016
you're looking at a lot of time.

711
00:40:34,018 --> 00:40:35,293
I mean, even if...
Even if you're not,

712
00:40:35,295 --> 00:40:37,107
you're gonna try to sell
him that he's going.

713
00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:38,921
You know, you're going
to jail for a long time.

714
00:40:38,923 --> 00:40:40,904
If they don't know,
they may give it up.

715
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:43,323
<i>You either go to jail,
you get a record.</i>

716
00:40:43,325 --> 00:40:46,952
<i>From there, you have trouble getting
a job, can't support your family.</i>

717
00:40:46,954 --> 00:40:50,144
Or in the other hand, you
become an informant for us,

718
00:40:50,146 --> 00:40:52,664
and we'll let you off the charge.

719
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:56,259
<i>This exact scenario is what
gets most dealers into trouble.</i>

720
00:40:56,261 --> 00:40:59,351
<i>One of your employees or
customers gets picked up by cops</i>

721
00:40:59,353 --> 00:41:00,728
<i>and turned into a snitch.</i>

722
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,249
Yes, this was a situation in Vegas

723
00:41:03,251 --> 00:41:05,836
<i>where there was a guy,
he started using drugs</i>

724
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,297
<i>and Las Vegas Police
somehow got a hold of him.</i>

725
00:41:09,299 --> 00:41:12,859
<i>Eighteen-year-old Clifford Townson</i>

726
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:15,277
<i>denies he belongs to any gang,</i>

727
00:41:15,279 --> 00:41:18,772
<i>but admits he traveled from Los
Angeles here to Las Vegas.</i>

728
00:41:18,774 --> 00:41:20,923
<i>He has been arrested
for selling cocaine,</i>

729
00:41:20,925 --> 00:41:23,274
<i>and police suspect
he is a gang leader.</i>

730
00:41:23,276 --> 00:41:25,760
They actually put it in
the newspaper, and on TV.

731
00:41:25,762 --> 00:41:27,979
<i>We were celebrities,
we were the L.A. guys</i>

732
00:41:27,981 --> 00:41:29,860
<i>who had all the drugs, so...</i>

733
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,775
<i>Well, we were looking at 55 years.</i>

734
00:41:31,777 --> 00:41:33,388
<i>Skipp was offered a deal.</i>

735
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:34,867
<i>If he would plead guilty,</i>

736
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:37,554
and save the prosecutors
the trouble of going to trial.

737
00:41:37,557 --> 00:41:42,695
The offer came that it would be
five years as opposed to 55 years.

738
00:41:42,697 --> 00:41:44,746
Um, I signed up for it.

739
00:41:44,748 --> 00:41:46,593
<i>And what happened to the snitch?</i>

740
00:41:46,595 --> 00:41:48,542
He didn't get any time at all.

741
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:51,767
Matter of fact, he was let go, they
might have even paid him, I'm sure.

742
00:41:51,769 --> 00:41:54,826
Federal drug money
is allocated to states

743
00:41:54,828 --> 00:41:58,756
based on drug arrest numbers.

744
00:41:58,758 --> 00:42:02,083
<i>Alexandra Natapoff
is an award winning scholar</i>

745
00:42:02,085 --> 00:42:05,275
<i>and nationally recognized
expert on snitching.</i>

746
00:42:05,277 --> 00:42:07,828
Snitches are very good
at producing arrests.

747
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:10,786
They may not be very good at
solving important crimes,

748
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:13,286
or getting drugs off the street,
or making communities safer,

749
00:42:14,177 --> 00:42:16,998
but they are very good
at producing arrest numbers.

750
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,827
I was standing on the
side of 18, 12 officers.

751
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:24,793
Everybody pack a big gun.
You hear me?

752
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:28,019
And they, they are police.
They can shoot you.

753
00:42:28,021 --> 00:42:34,134
<i>Meet Derek Migras,
a Texas crack addict</i>

754
00:42:34,136 --> 00:42:38,468
<i>who police demanded give them 20 drug
dealers in a local housing project.</i>

755
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,791
Mr. Pascal told you if
you got incarcerated,

756
00:42:40,793 --> 00:42:42,571
bad things can happen
in prison, right?

757
00:42:42,573 --> 00:42:45,730
No, he told me that he
would make a phone call,

758
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:50,367
and have the biggest dick
son-of-a-bitch, excuse my words, y'all,

759
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:52,417
females,
but these is his exact words.

760
00:42:52,419 --> 00:42:56,415
"I have the biggest dick son-of-a-bitch
in there fuck you every day."

761
00:42:56,417 --> 00:42:58,566
So what you gonna do
if you was in my shoes?

762
00:42:58,568 --> 00:43:00,077
Cooperate and say
what they want you to...

763
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,639
<i>So Derek gave the
police a list of names.</i>

764
00:43:03,641 --> 00:43:05,891
<i>And 28 people were arrested.</i>

765
00:43:05,893 --> 00:43:10,527
Most snitches in the arena of street and
drug crime will never have a lawyer.

766
00:43:10,529 --> 00:43:12,812
They'll never talk to anyone
about their rights,

767
00:43:12,814 --> 00:43:15,197
about the nature of the case that
the government has against them.

768
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:17,684
They'll negotiate with the police
officer right there on the street

769
00:43:17,686 --> 00:43:19,533
or maybe in the back
of the police car.

770
00:43:19,535 --> 00:43:21,011
All right, let me
tell you like this here.

771
00:43:21,013 --> 00:43:24,639
I never bought drugs from Regina Kelly.
Straight up.

772
00:43:24,641 --> 00:43:27,328
<i>It turns out that all the
names were fabricated.</i>

773
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:30,687
<i>But cases like this
happen all the time.</i>

774
00:43:30,062 --> 00:43:31,673
<i>There's another reason
Derek Migras</i>

775
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:34,160
<i>gave a list of innocent
people to the cops.</i>

776
00:43:34,162 --> 00:43:36,075
<i>Because snitching
on a real drug dealer</i>

777
00:43:36,077 --> 00:43:38,293
<i>can have very
serious consequences.</i>

778
00:43:38,295 --> 00:43:41,518
Rachel Hoffman was a young
woman in Tallahassee, Florida.

779
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,862
<i>She was a college graduate,</i>

780
00:43:42,864 --> 00:43:44,576
she had a bright future
ahead of her.

781
00:43:44,578 --> 00:43:46,188
But she was caught by the police

782
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:47,701
with a small amount of marijuana

783
00:43:47,703 --> 00:43:49,481
and some non-prescription pills,

784
00:43:49,483 --> 00:43:50,792
<i>and the police threatened her.</i>

785
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,606
They told her that she
could work it off.

786
00:43:52,608 --> 00:43:54,891
She could do
an undercover drug buy.

787
00:43:54,893 --> 00:43:58,420
She was supposed to buy
15,000 ecstasy tablets,

788
00:43:58,422 --> 00:44:01,343
50 grams of cocaine,
and two handguns.

789
00:44:01,345 --> 00:44:04,636
She said,
"Mom I don't want you telling anybody,

790
00:44:04,638 --> 00:44:07,458
"'cause I'm getting
all my charges dropped."

791
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,777
<i>Rachel called her father
just hours</i>

792
00:44:09,779 --> 00:44:12,062
<i>before the sting operation
was to begin.</i>

793
00:44:12,064 --> 00:44:15,488
She said,
"Dad, I'm really thinking about you today."

794
00:44:16,631 --> 00:44:19,118
<i>And that was my last
conversation with her.</i>

795
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:23,419
<i>The people that she was set up to
meet knew that something was fishy,</i>

796
00:44:23,421 --> 00:44:24,930
and so they shot her.

797
00:44:24,932 --> 00:44:26,543
And at the end of the day,

798
00:44:26,545 --> 00:44:28,492
when the police were confronted

799
00:44:28,494 --> 00:44:30,911
with whether they had made
the right decision

800
00:44:30,913 --> 00:44:34,641
to send in a 22-year-old college
girl to make this kind of drug deal,

801
00:44:34,643 --> 00:44:35,985
do you know what they said?

802
00:44:35,987 --> 00:44:38,270
They said,
"Well, she didn't follow protocol."

803
00:44:38,272 --> 00:44:40,991
Now, see that's where everybody feels
we're looking to blame someone...

804
00:44:40,993 --> 00:44:43,310
But I asked you what happened, you said,
"She deviated from the plan."

805
00:44:43,312 --> 00:44:45,326
Well, and that's where, uh...

806
00:44:45,328 --> 00:44:49,055
Whenever the plan started going,
um, south, if you want to say,

807
00:44:49,057 --> 00:44:51,978
uh, where we lost
contact with Rachel

808
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,742
because she did not show up at the
location she was supposed to have gone to.

809
00:44:55,744 --> 00:44:59,942
You don't think she was pushed
into it, coerced by your officers?

810
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:01,281
Threatened with prison?

811
00:45:01,283 --> 00:45:03,263
For charges that were never filed?

812
00:45:04,608 --> 00:45:07,933
Again, we don't threaten people to
become confidential informants.

813
00:45:07,935 --> 00:45:10,823
That's not part of how we operate.
No, sir.

814
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,351
<i>The moral of the story
for most dealers is</i>

815
00:45:14,353 --> 00:45:17,644
<i>But if you do,
name innocent people,</i>

816
00:45:17,646 --> 00:45:19,962
<i>or demand a witness
protection program.</i>

817
00:45:21,443 --> 00:45:24,901
<i>is having a few counter
surveillance guys on your payroll.</i>

818
00:45:26,718 --> 00:45:31,152
<i>you run an investigation
on the cops following you,</i>

819
00:45:31,154 --> 00:45:35,923
<i>so when cops break the law, you've got
it on tape, and can negotiate a deal.</i>

820
00:45:35,925 --> 00:45:39,652
I went in and told them
they planted drugs on me,

821
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,937
that I didn't have drugs
that particular night.

822
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:44,827
That I was a drug dealer, but
that night, I didn't have drugs.

823
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:49,699
What these cops were doing were going
around and doing this to a lot of people.

824
00:45:49,701 --> 00:45:52,723
They wind up getting indicted,
and when they got indicted,

825
00:45:52,725 --> 00:45:56,352
I agreed to cooperate against the
cops for what they had did to me.

826
00:45:56,354 --> 00:46:01,124
<i>And that's how the King of Crack
spent only five years in prison.</i>

827
00:46:12,973 --> 00:46:17,609
<i>It's a great idea to get an ex-DEA
officer on your team as well.</i>

828
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:20,935
<i>When you're moving tons of illegal
cargo, like Brian O'Dea was,</i>

829
00:46:20,937 --> 00:46:22,582
<i>you can never be too careful.</i>

830
00:46:22,584 --> 00:46:26,043
We all agreed that we would
move this thing forward,

831
00:46:26,045 --> 00:46:27,991
that everybody would
go on a salary,

832
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:30,847
and the deal was no coke.
If you did coke you were out.

833
00:46:30,849 --> 00:46:33,536
<i>The problem was,
Brian loved cocaine.</i>

834
00:46:33,538 --> 00:46:36,224
<i>He loved all drugs,
ever since he was a kid.</i>

835
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:40,323
<i>I can tell you about the first day at
school, first period, first class.</i>

836
00:46:40,325 --> 00:46:42,070
<i>Around the corner came this guy,</i>

837
00:46:42,072 --> 00:46:46,236
<i>He took me to his office,
and half an hour later,</i>

838
00:46:46,238 --> 00:46:50,403
<i>I suffered the first sexual
abuse by an adult in my life.</i>

839
00:46:50,405 --> 00:46:54,435
<i>As a Catholic, we were taught sex
was punishable by eternity in hell.</i>

840
00:46:54,437 --> 00:47:00,853
<i>So I came out of that office negotiating
with God not to strike me dead today.</i>

841
00:47:00,855 --> 00:47:02,365
It was horrible, buddy.

842
00:47:02,367 --> 00:47:05,255
My mind became a place
to get out of.

843
00:47:05,257 --> 00:47:07,472
And so I, you know,
when I discovered that

844
00:47:07,474 --> 00:47:10,227
there were substances that
could take me out of there,

845
00:47:10,229 --> 00:47:11,974
I was going for them.

846
00:47:11,976 --> 00:47:18,090
<i>The moment I take cocaine, it's a
nightmare from that point until I stop.</i>

847
00:47:18,092 --> 00:47:22,122
<i>Coke has such an ownership
thing, it wants all of you.</i>

848
00:47:22,124 --> 00:47:25,011
<i>Brian knew this was the
biggest deal of his career.</i>

849
00:47:24,196 --> 00:47:26,715
<i>And as long as he stayed
clean, he'd be all right.</i>

850
00:47:26,717 --> 00:47:28,831
The first part of
the load was 25 tons.

851
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:30,881
<i>And we met it up
in the Bering Sea,</i>

852
00:47:30,883 --> 00:47:33,804
<i>and then took it off up
into a fjord in Alaska,</i>

853
00:47:33,806 --> 00:47:37,232
<i>repackaged it all
in wetlock fish boxes,</i>

854
00:47:37,234 --> 00:47:38,777
<i>put it all on the trucks,</i>

855
00:47:38,779 --> 00:47:41,768
<i>I mean, it was as smooth as silk.</i>

856
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:45,363
Once it was all offloaded,
we started partying.

857
00:47:50,539 --> 00:47:54,435
<i>There was only one little problem,
and it wasn't Brian O'Dea.</i>

858
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:58,702
<i>Brian's partner couldn't help but party
with a little cocaine one night.</i>

859
00:47:58,704 --> 00:48:01,491
<i>Then another night,
and then another one.</i>

860
00:48:01,493 --> 00:48:06,094
He'd show up at the house in the middle of
the night at 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning

861
00:48:06,096 --> 00:48:09,824
<i>in a limousine, prostitutes,
cocaine, booze.</i>

862
00:48:09,826 --> 00:48:13,587
Well, when he found out that the load
came in, he came looking for his money.

863
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:17,116
<i>And we were very concerned about him getting
out there with a whole pack of money</i>

864
00:48:17,118 --> 00:48:19,064
<i>and creating a giant heat-score</i>

865
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:21,181
<i>with these bags
of coke and hookers,</i>

866
00:48:21,183 --> 00:48:23,063
so there was a concern
about giving him anything,

867
00:48:23,065 --> 00:48:26,859
giving him something, giving him
a million bucks, what do we do?

868
00:48:26,861 --> 00:48:29,816
So the boys decided to give
him 50 grand, and I thought,

869
00:48:29,818 --> 00:48:33,109
"He is not going to be happy
with 50 grand."

870
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:36,234
He took that 50 grand,
he left that meeting,

871
00:48:36,236 --> 00:48:39,930
and he went right to the DEA's office
with the money and put it on the table.

872
00:48:39,932 --> 00:48:44,231
And said, "I can tell you where there's
millions more just like that."

873
00:48:43,733 --> 00:48:45,747
<i>A few days later,
Brian and his team</i>

874
00:48:45,749 --> 00:48:48,636
<i>were expecting 50 tons
of marijuana to come in.</i>

875
00:48:48,638 --> 00:48:52,568
<i>So Brian took the precaution
of hiring an ex-DEA agent</i>

876
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:56,969
<i>to run surveillance on any law
enforcement activity in the area.</i>

877
00:48:56,971 --> 00:48:59,657
<i>The load came in, a huge load.</i>

878
00:49:01,137 --> 00:49:04,496
We got a guy out from San Diego
who has a spectrum analyzer.

879
00:49:04,498 --> 00:49:07,889
<i>He's able to isolate the
transmission frequencies of the DEA,</i>

880
00:49:07,892 --> 00:49:09,973
and on the way up,
my scanner lights up,

881
00:49:09,975 --> 00:49:15,081
<i>And the moment it crossed the
border between Canada and the U.S.,</i>

882
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:21,767
<i>DEA, the FBI, alcohol tobacco
firearms, coast guard.</i>

883
00:49:21,769 --> 00:49:23,884
<i>Expecting to find reefer.</i>

884
00:49:25,934 --> 00:49:28,084
There wasn't a joint in sight,

885
00:49:28,086 --> 00:49:31,410
but there was fresh donuts made
and coffee on the brew,

886
00:49:31,412 --> 00:49:34,233
<i>and they took that as insult.</i>

887
00:49:34,235 --> 00:49:37,962
You know, you can't help doing
stuff like that sometimes.

888
00:49:39,038 --> 00:49:43,406
Seventy-five tons generated,
approximately 200 million U.S. dollars.

889
00:49:49,522 --> 00:49:54,931
<i>So where do you find an ex-DEA agent
or narc who's willing to work for you?</i>

890
00:49:54,433 --> 00:49:55,976
<i>We've got someone
we can recommend.</i>

891
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:11,533
<i>In high school, I wore overalls with no
shirt, my jeans tucked into my boots,</i>

892
00:50:11,535 --> 00:50:14,893
and I could yell "yee-haw"
louder than the rest of them.

893
00:50:14,895 --> 00:50:20,270
Well, any of the kids that we heard of
smoking marijuana, we would beat them up.

894
00:50:20,272 --> 00:50:23,629
The entire time, we'd be drinking
and fighting each other.

895
00:50:23,631 --> 00:50:28,334
<i>I decided to be cop because I
wanted to be able to fight legally.</i>

896
00:50:28,336 --> 00:50:30,954
<i>I loved everything
about law enforcement.</i>

897
00:50:30,956 --> 00:50:37,339
I learned how to manipulate
citizens into running, or fighting.

898
00:50:37,341 --> 00:50:40,967
<i>I was very popular among all
the other police officers</i>

899
00:50:40,969 --> 00:50:43,420
<i>because of the excitement
I could get them in.</i>

900
00:50:43,422 --> 00:50:45,806
<i>We were trained
when a motorist was speeding,</i>

901
00:50:45,808 --> 00:50:49,905
to get real close and then
activate the red and blue lights.

902
00:50:49,907 --> 00:50:53,500
Well, I learned to lag way back

903
00:50:53,502 --> 00:50:57,835
then turn my lights on to give
that motorist the opinion that

904
00:50:57,837 --> 00:51:00,591
"I might have a chance
to outrun this guy."

905
00:51:00,593 --> 00:51:05,126
<i>you're addicted to the adrenaline
and you don't realize it.</i>

906
00:51:06,371 --> 00:51:10,065
<i>I was the best drug agent
in the area.</i>

907
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:14,703
There's not a day that we don't put
somebody in jail for narcotics,

908
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:17,323
for finding mainly marijuana.

909
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:20,583
<i>I only had 5 miles of highway
in my jurisdiction</i>

910
00:51:20,085 --> 00:51:23,006
<i>and I made over
100 drug arrests in one year.</i>

911
00:51:23,008 --> 00:51:25,156
He's got a gun! Shoot!

912
00:51:25,158 --> 00:51:30,095
The DEA, they were jealous, because they were
supposed to be making all the big arrests.

913
00:51:30,097 --> 00:51:33,657
The first month, I performed
seven drug raids.

914
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:37,285
<i>The DEA were only doing one a year.
The entire DEA.</i>

915
00:51:37,287 --> 00:51:39,436
And they had jurisdiction
of every county,

916
00:51:39,438 --> 00:51:41,789
I only had jurisdiction
in one city.

917
00:51:41,791 --> 00:51:45,384
I'll never forget the last
marijuana arrest I made.

918
00:51:45,386 --> 00:51:49,483
And something hit me, I thought,
"I make three or four of these a day."

919
00:51:49,485 --> 00:51:53,247
Almost everybody I stop
has marijuana.

920
00:51:53,249 --> 00:51:58,219
There's marijuana roach in your
ash tray, and I smell marijuana.

921
00:51:58,221 --> 00:52:00,235
Ladies, any of y'all got
any marijuana on you?

922
00:52:00,237 --> 00:52:02,453
<i>I thought there's got to be
something to it.</i>

923
00:52:02,455 --> 00:52:05,409
<i>Well, for years,
I had pounds in my house</i>

924
00:52:05,411 --> 00:52:08,299
<i>as training aids
to train my drug dog.</i>

925
00:52:08,301 --> 00:52:12,399
So, I went home, and I smoked
that pot, and I loved it.

926
00:52:12,401 --> 00:52:15,154
I'm like,
"This is what it's about."

927
00:52:15,156 --> 00:52:18,245
<i>It's one of the funniest
things I'd ever done.</i>

928
00:52:18,247 --> 00:52:21,605
<i>I married my pot dealer,
this girl named Candy.</i>

929
00:52:21,607 --> 00:52:23,756
Candy and I were talking,
and I said,

930
00:52:23,758 --> 00:52:28,729
"Should I make a film on
how insane the drug war is

931
00:52:28,731 --> 00:52:32,391
"or should I just teach people
how not to get busted for pot?"

932
00:52:32,393 --> 00:52:34,709
All these secrets I had.

933
00:52:34,711 --> 00:52:37,801
And she said, "You gotta teach 'em
how not to get busted."

934
00:52:37,803 --> 00:52:41,597
<i>High Times, Cannabis Culture,
everything out there.</i>

935
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:45,395
<i>We went on the Internet, and
nothing was out there like it.</i>

936
00:52:47,546 --> 00:52:51,913
<i>Coming off the success of the
Never Get Busted video series,</i>

937
00:52:51,915 --> 00:52:55,508
we begin getting
thousands of emails

938
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:58,539
of people being arrested and
mistreated by law enforcement.

939
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:01,363
And if I got an email and it
fit exactly what I used to do,

940
00:53:01,365 --> 00:53:03,042
I knew
they were telling the truth.

941
00:53:03,044 --> 00:53:05,731
And we were getting
thousands of these.

942
00:53:05,733 --> 00:53:08,117
So Candy and I were talking
and she said,

943
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:12,484
"You know, Barry, you were so good
at busting all those citizens,

944
00:53:12,486 --> 00:53:16,752
"you should start busting
some of these crooked cops,"

945
00:53:16,754 --> 00:53:18,801
and I'm like, "Yeah!"

946
00:53:18,803 --> 00:53:23,976
<i>Barry Cooper's a guy you can
call if cops plant drugs on you.</i>

947
00:53:23,978 --> 00:53:26,294
<i>Even if you've never
dealt drugs in your life.</i>

948
00:53:26,296 --> 00:53:28,612
<i>My granddad told me
a long time ago,</i>

949
00:53:28,614 --> 00:53:30,562
<i>tough times don't build character.</i>

950
00:53:30,564 --> 00:53:32,309
Tough times show character.

951
00:53:32,311 --> 00:53:37,349
<i>he called us and he said,
"Tell you what I think happened.</i>

952
00:53:37,351 --> 00:53:39,835
"They made a mistake in identity."

953
00:53:39,837 --> 00:53:43,262
<i>Confidential informants ended up
planting drugs on the wrong person.</i>

954
00:53:43,264 --> 00:53:45,144
It struck me later on
that evening,

955
00:53:45,146 --> 00:53:47,731
it just kinda, you know,
my eyes popped open, like,

956
00:53:47,733 --> 00:53:50,823
"Wait a minute. How do you
plant drugs on the right person?"

957
00:53:50,825 --> 00:53:53,948
<i>and informant
was instructed by police</i>

958
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:56,030
<i>to plant a bag of meth
in his daughter's car.</i>

959
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:58,282
<i>But unfortunately,
the information was wrong,</i>

960
00:53:58,284 --> 00:54:02,078
Yolanda Madden was a working, single
mother of two at the time of her arrest.

961
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,574
So Raymond flew to East
Texas and met with me.

962
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:11,587
And I told him how we could catch those
officers that planted the drugs on Yolanda.

963
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:14,443
Because some of them
were my ex-partners.

964
00:54:16,394 --> 00:54:19,988
<i>Barry planted two Christmas trees
under some grow lamps.</i>

965
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,710
<i>Then, Odessa cops
received an anonymous tip</i>

966
00:54:22,712 --> 00:54:25,364
<i>that a major drug operation
was under way.</i>

967
00:54:25,366 --> 00:54:28,092
<i>As Barry knew they would,
the police broke a number of laws</i>

968
00:54:28,148 --> 00:54:31,244
<i>leading up to an illegal invasion
and search of his house.</i>

969
00:54:31,246 --> 00:54:34,437
Barry proved that Odessa cops
routinely break the law,

970
00:54:34,439 --> 00:54:37,292
<i>as standard operating procedure
in fighting the drug war.</i>

971
00:54:37,294 --> 00:54:39,241
Get these cameras ready.

972
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:41,593
<i>Hey, I'm Barry Cooper
with KopBusters!</i>

973
00:54:41,595 --> 00:54:43,407
Why are you in my house?

974
00:54:43,409 --> 00:54:48,313
I'm busy making sure these Odessa
cops quit planting drugs on people.

975
00:54:48,315 --> 00:54:50,195
We're not giving nobody no hassle.

976
00:54:50,197 --> 00:54:52,345
You did too. Y'all
planted drugs on Yolanda

977
00:54:52,347 --> 00:54:54,429
and she's in prison because of it.

978
00:54:54,431 --> 00:54:57,318
That's giving people a hassle.

979
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:00,342
You guys are wrong on this one
and you know it. You got burnt.

980
00:55:00,344 --> 00:55:03,567
He got a media event, and
that thing went national.

981
00:55:03,569 --> 00:55:08,373
In 2008, ex-drug officer Barry
Cooper set up Odessa police

982
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:10,057
to bring attention
to Madden's case.

983
00:55:10,059 --> 00:55:12,039
It was a success.

984
00:55:12,041 --> 00:55:16,643
And to prove we were right, the judge let her go.
She got out of prison.

985
00:55:16,645 --> 00:55:19,196
<i>Painful memories that melt away</i>

986
00:55:19,198 --> 00:55:22,388
<i>as Yolanda Madden
emerges a free woman.</i>

987
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:25,681
I went to prison a single
mom of two kids, 16 and 11.

988
00:55:25,683 --> 00:55:27,731
My son is 20 and married.

989
00:55:27,733 --> 00:55:31,090
And of course my daughter is,
she's getting ready to be 16.

990
00:55:31,092 --> 00:55:33,275
And I'm talking to this
young woman, you know,

991
00:55:33,277 --> 00:55:35,223
that was just a child when I left.

992
00:55:35,225 --> 00:55:38,617
So, I mean, I miss the
years, you know. But...

993
00:55:41,173 --> 00:55:44,465
I've got lots of ways
to sting cops.

994
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:46,347
It just takes money.

995
00:55:47,491 --> 00:55:52,496
<i>If you've come this far, you've learned
to beat cases and outsmart the law,</i>

996
00:55:52,498 --> 00:55:56,058
while stacking up hundreds of
millions of dollars in cash.

997
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:59,115
<i>This concludes chapter six,
How to Be a Kingpin.</i>

998
00:55:59,117 --> 00:56:02,508
<i>You're almost ready for the top
level, Running a Drug Cartel.</i>

999
00:56:02,508 --> 00:56:04,258
<i>But before we go overseas</i>

1000
00:56:04,211 --> 00:56:07,616
<i>there's one more way to make
money in the game here at home,</i>

1001
00:56:07,618 --> 00:56:09,700
<i>even more than kingpins.</i>

1002
00:56:09,702 --> 00:56:11,782
<i>This is the secret level.</i>

1003
00:56:15,249 --> 00:56:18,943
<i>For all you government
officials out there,</i>

1004
00:56:18,945 --> 00:56:21,027
<i>we're going to teach you
how to expand your power,</i>

1005

<i>and take out political opponents.</i>

1006
00:56:22,877 --> 00:56:25,294
<i>All you need is a drug war.</i>

1007
00:56:25,296 --> 00:56:30,838
<i>Drugs used to be legal.
Heroin, cocaine, everything.</i>

1008
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:35,341
<i>Until about 100 years ago, when America
appointed its first drug czar,</i>

1009
00:56:35,343 --> 00:56:37,457
<i>a man named Harry Anslinger.</i>

1010
00:56:37,459 --> 00:56:39,440
<i>In his report to the U.S. Senate,</i>

1011
00:56:39,442 --> 00:56:43,002
Anslinger detailed the reasons
drugs must be outlawed.

1012
00:56:43,004 --> 00:56:44,111
<i>This is what he said.</i>

1013
00:56:44,113 --> 00:56:48,243
<i>"There are 100,000
marijuana smokers in the U.S.,</i>

1014
00:56:48,245 --> 00:56:52,544
<i>"and most are Negroes,
Hispanics, Filipinos, and entertainers.</i>

1015
00:56:52,546 --> 00:56:56,476
<i>"Their satanic music, jazz and swing,
result from marijuana use.</i>

1016
00:56:56,478 --> 00:57:01,717
"It causes white women to seek sexual relations
with Negroes, entertainers and others."

1017
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:07,630
<i>Anslinger's popularity
soared with voters,</i>

1018
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,184
<i>and lawmakers
began outlawing drugs.</i>

1019
00:57:10,186 --> 00:57:14,187
Then the evangelical movement inspired
Congress to ban alcohol as well.

1020
00:57:15,084 --> 00:57:16,334
<i>Gangsterism was a natural sequel</i>

1021
00:57:16,389 --> 00:57:19,761
<i>and battles for exclusive
territories erupted with a violence</i>

1022
00:57:19,763 --> 00:57:22,247
<i>unparalleled in the history
of law enforcement.</i>

1023
00:57:22,249 --> 00:57:24,801
<i>Guys like Al Capone were
suddenly making big bucks.</i>

1024
00:57:24,803 --> 00:57:28,295
<i>The black market exploded with such
violence that public opinion turned</i>

1025
00:57:28,297 --> 00:57:30,546
<i>and Roosevelt
ended alcohol prohibition,</i>

1026
00:57:30,548 --> 00:57:32,096
<i>crushing the burgeoning industry.</i>

1027
00:57:32,098 --> 00:57:34,549
<i>But Harry Anslinger didn't
stop pushing drug prohibition.</i>

1028
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:38,614
<i>In the 1960s, he took his case all
the way to the United Nations,</i>

1029
00:57:38,616 --> 00:57:43,554
<i>and lobbied the whole world to adopt the U.S.
policy of outlawing drugs.</i>

1030
00:57:43,556 --> 00:57:47,149
<i>Richard Nixon would pick up
where Anslinger left off.</i>

1031
00:57:48,158 --> 00:57:53,499
America's public enemy number one
in the United States is drug abuse.

1032
00:57:54,643 --> 00:57:57,734
<i>While publicly claiming to
address addiction and violence,</i>

1033
00:57:57,736 --> 00:58:00,421
<i>Nixon used drug policy as a weapon</i>

1034
00:58:00,423 --> 00:58:03,445
<i>to move against those he thought
of as his political enemies.</i>

1035
00:58:23,539 --> 00:58:25,353
To fight and defeat this enemy,

1036
00:58:25,355 --> 00:58:29,822
it is necessary to wage
a new, all-out offensive.

1037
00:58:29,824 --> 00:58:33,653
<i>President Nixon created the Drug
Enforcement Administration,</i>

1038
00:58:33,655 --> 00:58:39,098
with an annual budget of $65 million,
and started the war on drugs.

1039
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,694
<i>If you are a governor, mayor, police
chief, or any public official,</i>

1040
00:58:42,696 --> 00:58:46,558
<i>an enormous amount of money was suddenly
available from the federal government.</i>

1041
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,279
<i>All you had to do
was enlist in the drug war.</i>

1042
00:58:49,281 --> 00:58:52,069
<i>All of us in law enforcement,
we're soldiers.</i>

1043
00:58:52,071 --> 00:58:55,193
We developed the cases, we got the
informants, we did the search warrants,

1044
00:58:55,195 --> 00:58:59,192
we did the wire taps, but we
didn't take the money out of it.

1045
00:58:59,192 --> 00:59:00,942
So what happened?

1046
00:59:00,894 --> 00:59:04,333
All the wonderful little entrepreneurs said,
"Now it's my time."

1047
00:59:04,335 --> 00:59:06,852
<i>Twelve years later,
the federal drug war budget</i>

1048
00:59:06,854 --> 00:59:09,843
<i>had grown to over
$1.5 billion a year.</i>

1049
00:59:11,323 --> 00:59:14,212
And the Reagan administration
stepped up the rhetoric.

1050
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:23,350
For the sake of our children,
I implore each of you,

1051
00:59:23,352 --> 00:59:27,719
to be unyielding and inflexible
in your opposition to drugs.

1052
00:59:27,721 --> 00:59:29,063
Say yes to your life.

1053
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,818
And when it comes to drugs,
just say no.

1054
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:33,364
"Just say no" is sort of a fraud,

1055
00:59:33,366 --> 00:59:35,415
it's one America
talking to the other

1056
00:59:35,437 --> 00:59:38,359
not even knowing how the
other half has to live.

1057

<i>David Simon is the creator of the
critically acclaimed series  The Wire.</i>

1058
00:59:41,855 --> 00:59:45,180
When you're at war,

1059
00:59:45,182 --> 00:59:49,683

Yeah, we were saying "just say no"

1064
00:59:58,454 --> 01:00:00,636
to involving yourself
in the drug trade.

1065
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:04,433
It was like telling people in a factory town,
"Don't go to work for steel."

1066
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:07,053
<i>Or telling people in Detroit,
"Don't go to work for GM."</i>

1067
01:00:07,056 --> 01:00:09,439
<i>"Just say no" in West Baltimore
is telling somebody,</i>

1068
01:00:09,441 --> 01:00:13,136
"Don't go work for the only factory
that is hiring in your neighborhood."

1069
01:00:13,138 --> 01:00:16,025
<i>And the country is telling you implicitly,
"We don't need you."</i>

1070

<i>You're a human being
without purpose.</i>

1071
01:00:18,447 --> 01:00:22,073
<i>And that's 10, to 15, to 20% of
our population at this point.</i>

1072
01:00:22,075 --> 01:00:24,493
You got to realize we ain't got
no jobs around here or nothin'.

1073
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:28,154
You know, so, every time we try
to make a little somethin'

1074
01:00:28,156 --> 01:00:31,178
to get on our feet, to try
and help to feed our family,

1075
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:34,008
they come kicking the doors in and
knocking, knocking us back down again.

1076
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:37,369
Even as you fall into the corner
culture and ruin your life,

1077
01:00:37,372 --> 01:00:40,293
um, you're granted meaning.

1078
01:00:40,295 --> 01:00:42,410
You're granted a purpose.

1079
01:00:42,412 --> 01:00:45,132
You're gonna go out and you're
going to sell this G-pack today

1080
01:00:45,134 --> 01:00:48,121
And you're going to bring that
money home to your people.

1081
01:00:48,123 --> 01:00:50,877
So "just say no" was a problem.

1082
01:00:50,879 --> 01:00:55,212
Um, in that, we had not given
the slightest bit of thought

1083

as to what people in these worlds

1084
01:00:59,393 --> 01:01:00,893

Len Bias was
a college star athlete.

1092
01:01:20,882 --> 01:01:23,467
He was signed to go
to the Boston Celtics.

1093
01:01:23,469 --> 01:01:28,540
<i>he signs, like, a contract with
Adidas for millions of dollars.</i>

1094

of Maryland, he's snorting cocaine...

1096
01:01:36,002 --> 01:01:39,729

was because of, uh, heavy cocaine use.

1097
01:01:39,731 --> 01:01:41,511

01:02:01,673 --> 01:02:03,420
<i>which, an alarm
they helped create.</i>

1105
01:02:03,394 --> 01:02:06,182
We're dealing with nothing
less than chemical warfare

1106
01:02:06,184 --> 01:02:08,399
against the youth of this nation.

1107
01:02:08,401 --> 01:02:11,456
<i>Press conferences, speeches,
"The Plague."</i>

1108
01:02:11,458 --> 01:02:12,935
<i>"Should we put in the death penalty?"</i>

1109
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:14,817
<i>"Yeah, let's have the death penalty!"</i>

1110
01:02:14,819 --> 01:02:20,629
People who push drugs must be put
in jail for a minimum of 50 years.

1111
01:02:20,631 --> 01:02:23,653
It had this quality of, like,
Sotheby's auction, you know.

1112
01:02:23,655 --> 01:02:26,677
"I'll see ya! I'll raise ya!
I'm tougher, I'm meaner!"

1113
01:02:26,679 --> 01:02:28,828
In my nine years
working for the Congress,

1114
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:33,599
this is the only time we wrote
legislation in such haste

1115
01:02:33,601 --> 01:02:36,018
and without careful consideration.

1116
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:38,673
<i>Actress Susan Sarandon
worked with many others</i>

1117
01:02:38,675 --> 01:02:40,824
<i>to fight against
the harsh drug sentences</i>

1118
01:02:40,826 --> 01:02:42,604
<i>that were spreading out
across the country.</i>

1119
01:02:42,606 --> 01:02:44,721
I just think people
don't understand really.

1120
01:02:44,723 --> 01:02:47,510
They just hear "tough on drugs"
and they just go, "Yeah!

1121
01:02:47,512 --> 01:02:49,761
"Let's do that."
You know, "We'll be safer."

1122
01:02:49,763 --> 01:02:52,584
They don't understand
what it, what it means.

1123
01:02:52,586 --> 01:02:54,936
Hamida Hassan,
a mother of three children,

1124
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:58,800
moved to her cousin's house in Nebraska
to escape an abusive boyfriend.

1125
01:02:58,802 --> 01:03:01,319
<i>They were selling drugs,
and I knew that, you know,</i>

1126
01:03:01,321 --> 01:03:04,788
but I didn't concern myself with the
particulars of what they were doing.

1127
01:03:04,805 --> 01:03:06,813
<i>It seemed more safe to me.</i>

1128
01:03:06,248 --> 01:03:07,748
<i>When her cousins were busted</i>

1129
01:03:08,086 --> 01:03:12,200
<i>Hamida was given the mandatory
minimum of 27 years.</i>

1130
01:03:12,116 --> 01:03:14,398
<i>I'm 25 years old,
I'm six months pregnant,</i>

1131
01:03:14,946 --> 01:03:16,446
<i>I have never been in trouble before</i>

1132
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,162
and I'm going to be sentenced
to a natural life sentence.

1133
01:03:18,164 --> 01:03:20,849
Right now, the way the laws
stand, you can murder somebody

1134
01:03:20,851 --> 01:03:24,142
and get out quicker than be in a
house where there's a drug bust

1135
01:03:24,144 --> 01:03:27,166
and you don't even know
what's going on.

1136
01:03:27,168 --> 01:03:29,384
You can end up serving 30 years.

1137
01:03:29,386 --> 01:03:32,206
It's crazy.
I mean, it's not right.

1138
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:35,533
<i>Since 1993, Hamida Hassan
has been in prison.</i>

1139
01:03:35,535 --> 01:03:38,187
And her children have grown up
without their mother.

1140
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:41,346
<i>I just always break out in tears,</i>

1141
01:03:41,348 --> 01:03:42,992
because I just miss my mom a lot

1142
01:03:42,995 --> 01:03:46,185
and I just hope that
she come home soon.

1143
01:03:46,187 --> 01:03:49,478
<i>Many of the people in federal
prison, as I'm speaking right now,</i>

1144
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:53,140
who are there on drug charges,
are there on mandatory minimums.

1145
01:03:53,142 --> 01:03:54,618
Whatever charge they're serving,

1146
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:56,130
they're serving a longer sentence

1147
01:03:56,132 --> 01:04:01,170
that in part reflects my failures

1148
01:04:01,172 --> 01:04:04,128
to be a better lawyer
in blocking that law.

1149
01:04:05,203 --> 01:04:07,152
It pains me very much,

1150
01:04:07,154 --> 01:04:10,679
you know, when I meet the
family members of these people,

1151
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:12,695
uh, it breaks my heart.

1152
01:04:20,184 --> 01:04:22,543
<i>It was a total success
for the Democrats.</i>

1153
01:04:22,045 --> 01:04:24,697
Many of the congressmen
behind the mandatory minimums

1154
01:04:24,699 --> 01:04:27,485
<i>were re-elected
the following term.</i>

1155
01:04:27,487 --> 01:04:30,644
If you really wanna do good in
politics, be tough on drugs.

1156
01:04:30,894 --> 01:04:32,394
<i>By the late 1980s</i>

1157
01:04:32,346 --> 01:04:36,222
<i>the CIA discovered that drug money
could help U.S. foreign interests.</i>

1158
01:04:36,224 --> 01:04:41,127
<i>Now we all know that the U.S.
government and the CIA supported</i>

1159
01:04:41,129 --> 01:04:44,857
the contras in Nicaragua,
in the middle '80s.

1160
01:04:44,859 --> 01:04:50,368
Now it is alleged the CIA also helped
the contras raise money for arms

1161
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:54,837
by introducing crack cocaine
into California.

1162
01:04:54,339 --> 01:04:57,260
There's no question in my mind
there is complicity

1163
01:04:57,262 --> 01:04:59,578
in the flow of drugs
into this country, period.

1164
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:03,342
A senate investigation led by
John Kerry of Massachusetts

1165
01:05:03,344 --> 01:05:07,340
<i>found that individuals who
provided support for the contras</i>

1166
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:09,781
<i>were involved in drug trafficking.</i>

1167
01:05:09,814 --> 01:05:12,750
<i>Freeway Rick's former South
American cocaine supplier</i>

1168
01:05:12,752 --> 01:05:15,405
<i>was a major contributor
to the contras.</i>

1169
01:05:15,407 --> 01:05:18,965
<i>Eventually the DEA hired him
to set up Freeway Rick,</i>

1170
01:05:18,967 --> 01:05:21,418
<i>putting him in jail for 20 years.</i>

1171
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:24,644
<i>The DEA paid Rick's supplier
for services,</i>

1172
01:05:24,646 --> 01:05:26,896
<i>and American crack cocaine users</i>

1173
01:05:26,898 --> 01:05:30,928
<i>helped pay for a U.S. government-supported
war in South America.</i>

1174
01:05:32,911 --> 01:05:36,639
And when that first cocaine
was smuggled in on a ship,

1175
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:39,496
it may as well have been
a deadly bacteria,

1176
01:05:39,498 --> 01:05:43,595
so much as it hurt the body,
the soul of our country.

1177
01:05:43,597 --> 01:05:48,064
But take my word for it,
this scourge will stop.

1178
01:05:48,066 --> 01:05:50,752
<i>President Bush Senior
doubled the war budget.</i>

1179
01:05:51,795 --> 01:05:55,758
<i>And by the end of his administration,
it had doubled yet again.</i>

1180
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:59,223
<i>During the '90s, government asset
forfeiture was also on the rise.</i>

1181
01:05:59,273 --> 01:06:00,793
What forgeiture laws do

1182
01:06:00,925 --> 01:06:04,360
is they permit the government to
seize assets and money of people

1183
01:06:04,362 --> 01:06:08,426
<i>where they believe that those assets
are connected to drug enforcement.</i>

1184
01:06:08,428 --> 01:06:11,853
It's very easy for the government
to get assets this way

1185
01:06:11,855 --> 01:06:14,071
because the standard of proof
is so much lower.

1186
01:06:14,073 --> 01:06:16,456
No one needs to be charged
or convicted of a crime.

1187
01:06:16,459 --> 01:06:19,144
The message to law enforcement
officers was simple.

1188
01:06:19,146 --> 01:06:21,833
In the event that you are
an undercover officer

1189
01:06:21,835 --> 01:06:24,588
and you see someone
carrying two suitcases,

1190
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:27,309
one is full of money,
the other is full of drugs,

1191
01:06:27,311 --> 01:06:28,620
follow the money.

1192
01:06:28,622 --> 01:06:32,383
Drugs coming up from Mexico
go north and east.

1193
01:06:32,385 --> 01:06:34,500
<i>To seize the large amounts
of money,</i>

1194
01:06:34,502 --> 01:06:39,573
<i>I was instructed to begin working
south and west bound traffic.</i>

1195
01:06:39,575 --> 01:06:45,256
<i>I got extremely talented at seizing
money under the rules of law.</i>

1196
01:06:45,258 --> 01:06:47,104
That's highway robbery.

1197
01:06:47,106 --> 01:06:50,666
I have heard a police officer say

1198
01:06:50,668 --> 01:06:52,278
"Chief, we need a new vehicle."

1199
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:55,606
He'd say "All right, go out,
find a drug dealer and seize one."

1200
01:06:55,608 --> 01:06:58,965
And so they literally
try to find this property.

1201
01:06:58,967 --> 01:07:02,325
If I found 100,000
dollars drug money,

1202
01:07:02,327 --> 01:07:06,694
that paid my salary for a year,
auto expenses, dog expenses,

1203
01:07:06,696 --> 01:07:09,347
whatever it took
to keep me on board,

1204
01:07:09,349 --> 01:07:11,262
everything after that was profit.

1205
01:07:11,265 --> 01:07:14,791
The same problem comes up with
regard to police corruption.

1206
01:07:14,793 --> 01:07:19,293
You go out in the field and
you will see a stack of cash.

1207
01:07:19,295 --> 01:07:23,023
So you just lift maybe 10, 20,
30, 40 dollars off the top

1208
01:07:23,025 --> 01:07:23,766
and nobody notices,

1209
01:07:23,768 --> 01:07:25,716
and of course
there's no accounting anyway,

1210
01:07:25,718 --> 01:07:27,765
so next time you will lift
maybe a hundred.

1211
01:07:27,767 --> 01:07:29,713
If I found a stash of money,

1212
01:07:29,715 --> 01:07:32,032
I'd take a couple hundred bucks,

1213
01:07:32,034 --> 01:07:34,620
stick it in my pocket
and then turn it in.

1214
01:07:34,622 --> 01:07:36,938
I'm not proud of that.

1215
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:39,122
<i>Between 2000 and 2003,</i>

1216
01:07:39,124 --> 01:07:42,516
<i>the Department of Justice
earned over one billion dollars</i>

1217
01:07:42,518 --> 01:07:43,826
<i>in forfeiture proceeds.</i>

1218
01:07:43,828 --> 01:07:46,615
<i>By 2008, that number had tripled.</i>

1219
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:49,202
<i>By the time Clinton left office,</i>

1220
01:07:49,452 --> 01:07:51,360
<i>teenage use of drugs was higher.</i>

1221
01:07:51,304 --> 01:07:54,074
<i>High school students' use of
methamphetamines had doubled.</i>

1222
01:07:54,076 --> 01:07:57,299
<i>And heroin and cocaine were
cheaper and purer than they were</i>

1223
01:07:57,301 --> 01:08:00,391
<i>when the first drug laws
were passed in 1914.</i>

1224
01:08:00,393 --> 01:08:04,390
The war on drugs is not winnable,
but it's eminently fundable,

1225
01:08:04,392 --> 01:08:07,145
and the government
is addicted to that funding.

1226
01:08:07,147 --> 01:08:09,295
You know, the worst thing
about this drug war,

1227
01:08:09,297 --> 01:08:12,890
it just ruined this job.

1228
01:08:12,892 --> 01:08:14,470
You know I began
as a police reporter,

1229
01:08:14,472 --> 01:08:17,258
somebody very sympathetic
to good police work,

1230
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,106
and I still am sympathetic
to good police work.

1231
01:08:19,108 --> 01:08:22,265
But I have no regard
for the drug war anymore.

1232
01:08:22,267 --> 01:08:24,382
<i>If you're a fan of
the HBO series The Wire,</i>

1233
01:08:24,384 --> 01:08:26,297
you see this emphasized
over and over again,

1234
01:08:26,299 --> 01:08:28,918
that it's all about
statistics and numbers.

1235
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,404
<i>Radley Balko is a journalist
who spent years</i>

1236
01:08:31,406 --> 01:08:34,636
<i>studying the effects that federal drug
money has had on law enforcement.</i>

1237
01:08:34,638 --> 01:08:37,619
You need to make as many
drug arrests as possible,

1238
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:38,604
seize as many drugs as possible,

1239
01:08:38,604 --> 01:08:40,349
and that's how you get your grant

<i>If you're running
a police department,</i>

1241
01:08:42,165 --> 01:08:43,809
<i>you don't get massive grant money</i>

1242
01:08:43,811 --> 01:08:47,438
<i>for solving murder cases,
or rapes, or theft.</i>

1243
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:51,235
<i>Your only major financial incentive
is to solve drug crimes,</i>

1244
01:08:51,237 --> 01:08:53,991
<i>and if you don't make the same
drug arrests as last year,</i>

1245
01:08:53,993 --> 01:08:56,477
<i>you won't get
the same budgets this year.</i>

1246
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:59,501
And yet, all you're doing is
making meaningless street arrests

1247
01:08:59,503 --> 01:09:01,786
that have no consequence.

1248
01:09:02,378 --> 01:09:03,957
You are just harvesting stats.

1249
01:09:03,957 --> 01:09:07,968
<i>This incentivizes police departments
to set up specialized SWAT teams</i>

1250
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:10,690
<i>so police can conduct
more drug raids.</i>

1251
01:09:10,692 --> 01:09:13,983
<i>And the U.S. government will provide
money for SWAT equipment as well.</i>

1252
01:09:13,985 --> 01:09:18,116
No-knock raids are some of the
most cruel, horrible tragedies

1253
01:09:18,118 --> 01:09:21,677
<i>a human can go through
because it's so terrifying.</i>

1254
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:25,944
I raided over 100 houses
in my law enforcement career.

1255
01:09:25,946 --> 01:09:29,304
<i>There'd be 15 of us
in all this riot gear,</i>

1256

<i>and the biggest, fanciest
guns we could get.</i>

1257
01:09:32,566 --> 01:09:34,647
I was always the guy
who kicked the door in,

1258
01:09:34,649 --> 01:09:36,327
'cause I was
the most aggressive one.

1259
01:09:36,329 --> 01:09:42,375
And we threw flash grenades in
the window to confuse everybody.

1260
01:09:44,728 --> 01:09:49,095
<i>The one that really
stands out in my mind was,</i>

1261
01:09:50,205 --> 01:09:54,102
I remember a blonde-headed
girl with blue eyes,

1262
01:09:54,104 --> 01:09:56,285
like my daughter's,

1263
01:09:56,287 --> 01:10:01,897
and it almost seems like it
was one of my daughters now.

1264
01:10:01,899 --> 01:10:05,996
<i>And uh, she had a brother,
and they were so scared.</i>

1265
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:08,953
Don't move, you understand?

1266
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:11,305
Did you shoot my dog?

1267
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:13,489
Did you shoot my fucking dog?

1268
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,148
Why did you do that?

1269
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:28,408
And we ripped that family
apart for a bag of pot?

1270
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,745
Sometimes people feed
them wrong information,

1271
01:10:32,747 --> 01:10:34,357
sometimes it's just an accident,

1272
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:38,490
where they read,
instead of "863" they read "868"

1273
01:10:38,797 --> 01:10:40,170
and they go into the wrong room.

1274
01:10:40,213 --> 01:10:43,228
And when they got to the house of
the former marine, Jose Guerena,

1275
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:46,386
he had already been alerted by his
wife that someone was outside,

1276
01:10:46,388 --> 01:10:48,033
so he grabbed his rifle.

1277
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:50,452
But before Guerena could remove
the safety from his rifle,

1278
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:54,081
he was greeted by more than 60
bullets from law enforcement.

1279
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:57,273
The SWAT team refused to let
anyone attend to Guerena,

1280
01:10:57,275 --> 01:10:59,155
leaving no hope
for him to survive.

1281
01:10:59,157 --> 01:11:01,641
We've raised a generation
of cops in Baltimore

1282
01:11:01,643 --> 01:11:04,060
who can make a drug arrest,
but can't do police work.

1283
01:11:04,062 --> 01:11:05,639
You don't know
how to use an informant

1284
01:11:05,641 --> 01:11:07,021
and not be used by an informant.

1285
01:11:06,923 --> 01:11:09,743
You don't know how to write
an intelligent search warrant,

1286
01:11:09,745 --> 01:11:12,935
you don't know how to retroactively
investigate a crime,

1287
01:11:12,937 --> 01:11:15,287
you don't understand
how to maintain a crime scene.

1288
01:11:15,289 --> 01:11:18,177
All the things that count
as quality police work,

1289
01:11:18,179 --> 01:11:21,839
that's a direct consequence of the
drug war that nobody thought about.

1290
01:11:21,841 --> 01:11:25,938
<i>In the 1980s, there were about
3,000 SWAT raids a year.</i>

1291
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:30,239
<i>Today, that number is estimated at
around 50,000 SWAT raids a year.</i>

1292
01:11:31,484 --> 01:11:34,977
<i>Most serving warrants on
non-violent drug offenders.</i>

1293
01:11:34,979 --> 01:11:37,399
These raids gone wrong
are actually pretty common.

1294
01:11:37,302 --> 01:11:39,887
<i>They happen, by my estimate, a few
times a week, across the country.</i>

1295
01:11:40,542 --> 01:11:42,937
<i>92-year-old Katherine Joneston was killed</i>

1296
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:45,834
<i>when narcotics officers knocked down
the door at her home on Neal Street,</i>

1297
01:11:45,836 --> 01:11:47,782
<i>and then opened fire.</i>

1298
01:11:48,129 --> 01:11:49,312
<i>Earlier this week</i>

1299
01:11:49,312 --> 01:11:54,536
<i>a 68-year-old grandfather of 12 was killed
in his home in Framingham, Massachusetts.</i>

1300
01:11:54,539 --> 01:11:56,485
<i>While drug war money has financed</i>

1301
01:11:56,487 --> 01:12:00,652
<i>an unprecedented expansion
of U.S. law enforcement,</i>

1302
01:12:00,654 --> 01:12:04,886
<i>the bulk of drug money has continued
to flow outside U.S. borders</i>

1303
01:12:04,888 --> 01:12:07,607
<i>and into the pockets
of true masters of the game.</i>

1304
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:35,260
As a cartel drug lord, your biggest problem
is going to be counting your money.

1305
01:12:35,262 --> 01:12:38,351
<i>But you'll have a few guys
hired to do that.</i>

1306
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:42,417
<i>And a few more guys to count your mansions,
houses, planes, boats, luxury cars,</i>

1307
01:12:42,419 --> 01:12:45,811
<i>and all the material possessions
you could possibly dream of.</i>

1308
01:12:47,022 --> 01:12:48,936
<i>Like all the kings
and emperors before you,</i>

1309
01:12:48,938 --> 01:12:51,893
<i>you too will have
your very own army.</i>

1310
01:12:51,895 --> 01:12:55,992
<i>Driving around in custom made tanks designed
by top military equipment engineers.</i>

1311
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:59,242
<i>If you are a mexican cartel lord</i>

1312
01:12:59,242 --> 01:13:02,511
<i>and too many of your men
find themselves in prison,</i>

1313
01:13:02,513 --> 01:13:07,114
you just send a couple hundred of your best
guys down there and get them out of jail.

1314
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:09,667
<i>The guards won't stop you.</i>

1315
01:13:09,669 --> 01:13:13,464
<i>Anyone you perceive as being a
threat, you send a message.</i>

1316
01:13:13,466 --> 01:13:15,279
<i>You chop off people's heads.</i>

1317
01:13:16,456 --> 01:13:18,605
<i>You roll those heads
into nightclubs</i>

1318
01:13:18,607 --> 01:13:23,712
or pile them up and hang their bodies from
bridges to keep your competition in line.

1319
01:13:23,714 --> 01:13:28,383
<i>As a cartel drug lord, you kill
anybody who gets in your way,</i>

1320
01:13:28,385 --> 01:13:30,466
<i>literally gunning down civilians,</i>

1321
01:13:30,468 --> 01:13:32,717
<i>as long as you hit your target.</i>

1322
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:36,480
<i>You'll be so used to killing,
nothing will faze you anymore.</i>

1323
01:13:37,758 --> 01:13:44,041
<i>Since 2006, over 50,000 people have
been murdered in Mexico's war on drugs.</i>

1324
01:13:44,043 --> 01:13:46,863
<i>Most of those cases
remain unsolved.</i>

1325
01:13:46,865 --> 01:13:50,358
<i>Not because you're careful
about covering up your crimes,</i>

1326
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:52,441
<i>but because you terrify
the police.</i>

1327
01:13:52,443 --> 01:13:57,112
What happens when you as a public
official, or a police chief,

1328
01:13:57,114 --> 01:14:00,908
receive an envelope with
photographs of your family?

1329
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:03,298
It won't take you long
either to resign,

1330
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:05,684
or to go along with their wishes.

1331
01:14:05,686 --> 01:14:10,051
The drug cartels have more money and
more guns than the police do.

1332
01:14:10,053 --> 01:14:12,034
In a lot of ways, that
doesn't make any difference

1333
01:14:12,036 --> 01:14:13,546
because the police
are on their payrolls,

1334
01:14:13,548 --> 01:14:16,403
but where they're not, they can
literally outgun the police.

1335
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:20,367
<i>To run a global company,</i>

1336
01:14:20,369 --> 01:14:22,585
<i>you need operatives
all over the world.</i>

1337
01:14:22,587 --> 01:14:26,448
<i>An international work force
rivaling any other Fortune 500.</i>

1338
01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:28,902
<i>So where do you find
your employees?</i>

1339
01:14:28,904 --> 01:14:31,724
<i>Like business school does
for our corporate leaders,</i>

1340
01:14:31,726 --> 01:14:33,841
<i>jails are like
the ultimate job fair</i>

1341
01:14:33,843 --> 01:14:37,469
for gangs, dealers, hitmen,
and other criminals for hire.

1342
01:14:37,471 --> 01:14:40,359
<i>We was in there beating
people up, robbing people.</i>

1343
01:14:40,361 --> 01:14:42,981
I almost killed a guy. I beat him
so bad that I almost killed him.

1344
01:14:42,983 --> 01:14:45,265
<i>You know, tensions
are high at all times.</i>

1345
01:14:45,267 --> 01:14:46,744
If it's not between
the Bloods and Crips,

1346
01:14:46,746 --> 01:14:48,894
it might be between
the blacks and Latinos,

1347
01:14:48,896 --> 01:14:51,750
or might be between
the prison guards and inmates.

1348
01:14:51,752 --> 01:14:54,909
80% of the guys in there don't
have a high school diploma,

1349
01:14:54,859 --> 01:14:56,426
<i>and grew up in a single parent home.</i>

1350
01:14:56,411 --> 01:14:58,941
<i>So if you have no one
to show you what manhood is,</i>

1351
01:14:58,443 --> 01:15:00,490
you'll be just like
the sharks just out there,

1352
01:15:00,422 --> 01:15:02,058
only the strongest survive.

1353
01:15:00,492 --> 01:15:07,311
From 1920 to 1970 the rate of incarceration
in the United States was level.

1354
01:15:07,313 --> 01:15:11,444
<i>From the depression, World
War II, the postwar boom,</i>

1355
01:15:11,446 --> 01:15:14,132
<i>through the '50s,
through the '60s,</i>

1356
01:15:14,134 --> 01:15:15,745
<i>the rate of incarceration
was level.</i>

1357
01:15:15,747 --> 01:15:18,802
<i>Public enemy number one
is drug abuse.</i>

1358
01:15:18,804 --> 01:15:22,734
<i>In 1970, the rate of
incarceration starts going up.</i>

1359
01:15:22,736 --> 01:15:26,261
<i>And it has not stopped
going up for a half century.</i>

1360
01:15:28,446 --> 01:15:30,630
<i>Only 5% of the world is American.</i>

1361
01:15:30,632 --> 01:15:34,494
<i>But today, America has 25%
of the world's prisoners.</i>

1362
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:37,753
<i>The United States of America,
the land of the free,</i>

1363
01:15:37,755 --> 01:15:40,710
leads the world in the
incarceration of our people.

1364
01:15:40,769 --> 01:15:41,738
We hunt the poor

1365
01:15:41,738 --> 01:15:46,321
And incarcerate them at levels
unheard of in the rest of the world.

1366
01:15:46,323 --> 01:15:50,757
No other nation comes close.
Not China, not Russia, nobody.

1367
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:52,369
There are only two explanations,

1368
01:15:52,371 --> 01:15:55,528
one is that we are uniquely evil,

1369
01:15:55,530 --> 01:15:59,829
and the other is that we have
uniquely counterproductive laws.

1370
01:15:59,831 --> 01:16:02,319
<i>And while the prison population
continues to grow,</i>

1371
01:16:02,321 --> 01:16:05,041
<i>the demand for illegal drugs
is still rising.</i>

1372
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:15,357
<i>50% of America has consumed
an illegal drug.</i>

1373
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:17,640
<i>Do they think they can lock
up half of the country?</i>

1374
01:16:17,642 --> 01:16:20,128
<i>There's just no stopping us.</i>

1375
01:16:20,130 --> 01:16:22,311
Everybody I know wants to
do drugs is doing them.

1376
01:16:22,313 --> 01:16:24,596
They don't care if it's legal
or illegal, they're doing them.

1377
01:16:24,645 --> 01:16:25,920
<i>And they are proud of it.</i>

1378
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:29,569
<i>Some of America's most famous
business leaders, like Steve Jobs,</i>

1379
01:16:29,571 --> 01:16:34,206
has said taking LSD was one of the most
important experiences of his life.

1380
01:16:34,069 --> 01:16:35,553
Quite a few americans agree with him.

1381
01:16:35,553 --> 01:16:40,254
I don't think it's as much a question
about drugs as it's about freedom.

1382
01:16:40,256 --> 01:16:42,337
Whatever this freedom word means,

1383
01:16:42,339 --> 01:16:44,589
we really gotta grab hold of that.

1384
01:16:45,564 --> 01:16:48,486
<i>Either we have the right
to do what we want to do</i>

1385
01:16:48,488 --> 01:16:51,477
<i>as long as we aren't
hurting someone else,</i>

1386
01:16:51,479 --> 01:16:54,333
<i>or we're not living
in a free country.</i>

1387
01:16:54,335 --> 01:16:57,794
I'm just horrified by the way
that we think of people

1388
01:16:57,796 --> 01:17:00,414
because of the choice of substance
that they put in their bodies

1389
01:17:00,416 --> 01:17:01,960
to alter their perception.

1390
01:17:01,962 --> 01:17:04,581
And we judge them as good or bad,

1391
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:08,579
while we sip our wine
and have our cocktail parties

1392
01:17:08,581 --> 01:17:10,159
and you know...

1393
01:17:10,161 --> 01:17:13,518
Stick that hypocrisy right up
society's ass for me.

1394
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:17,752
Some of them can kill you the first time you
try them and other ones are really fun.

1395
01:17:17,754 --> 01:17:19,768
And someone's lying to you
if they say they're not.

1396
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:23,968
Our own power as individuals over
our own bodies, our thoughts,

1397
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:27,061
our minds, our ideas,
and our feelings,

1398
01:17:27,063 --> 01:17:29,550
those are not things that
can be taken away from us.

1399
01:17:29,552 --> 01:17:33,448
And anybody who would allow
the state to take them away

1400
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:36,270
doesn't deserve the title
"American citizen."

1401
01:17:37,616 --> 01:17:39,933
<i>The vast majority
of drug dealers never make it.</i>

1402
01:17:39,935 --> 01:17:42,487
<i>They're either killed,
or wind up in prison.</i>

1403
01:17:42,489 --> 01:17:44,737
<i>But Americans just keep
demanding more drugs.</i>

1404
01:17:44,739 --> 01:17:49,711
<i>Approximately half a million Americans
are incarcerated on drug charges.</i>

1405
01:17:49,713 --> 01:17:52,567
In recent years we've spent
more money building new prisons

1406
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:54,389
than building new universities.

1407
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:58,044
<i>And they are beneficiaries, the
people who manage these prisons,</i>

1408
01:17:58,046 --> 01:18:00,631
<i>the prison guards' unions,</i>

1409
01:18:00,633 --> 01:18:03,890
they all have a vested interest in
perpetuating this broken system.

1410
01:18:03,892 --> 01:18:07,149
<i>And famous American freedom advocates
have been speaking for years</i>

1411
01:18:07,151 --> 01:18:09,401
<i>about the conflict of
interest for politicians.</i>

1412
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:14,205
Are you running for office,
and you need more dough?

1413
01:18:14,207 --> 01:18:16,792
Adopt a tough on crime position,

1414
01:18:16,794 --> 01:18:20,153
you'll get a lot of money from the
prison industry. Think about it.

1415
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:28,989
<i>But even the largest prison system
in the history of the world</i>

1416
01:18:28,991 --> 01:18:31,279
<i>is just another market
for drug dealers.</i>

1417
01:18:31,281 --> 01:18:33,496
There are drugs inside jail.

1418
01:18:34,639 --> 01:18:40,889
Oh, you can find weed, coke, crystal meth, ecstasy.
Even heroin, you can find.

1419
01:18:40,891 --> 01:18:44,685
People work there, bring
it over, or visitors.

1420
01:18:45,795 --> 01:18:47,709
There's drugs inside jail.

1421
01:18:50,432 --> 01:18:51,842
<i>Congratulations.</i>

1422
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:53,525
<i>As a cartel drug lord</i>

1423
01:18:52,544 --> 01:18:56,882
<i>you're the number one organized
crime threat in the United States,</i>

1424
01:18:56,884 --> 01:19:00,746
<i>having set up franchises in
over 1,000 American cities.</i>

1425
01:19:00,748 --> 01:19:03,737
<i>You have an operating budget
larger than most countries.</i>

1426
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:09,146
<i>You and your partners in crime make
over 150 billion dollars a year.</i>

1427
01:19:09,148 --> 01:19:12,439
<i>And business shows
no signs of slowing down.</i>

1428
01:19:12,441 --> 01:19:17,210
<i>Because like any good game, the machine
creates an endless supply of players.</i>

1429
01:19:17,212 --> 01:19:20,671
The government always says drugs are
illegal, because they're bad for you,

1430
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:22,486
and we're trying
to protect societies,

1431
01:19:22,488 --> 01:19:25,106
but the government doesn't
give a fuck about your safety.

1432
01:19:25,108 --> 01:19:28,265
The government, they don't
want you to use your drugs,

1433
01:19:28,267 --> 01:19:30,852
they want you to use their drugs.

1434
01:19:30,854 --> 01:19:34,884
So every night on TV, you see
a weird ass drug commercial

1435
01:19:34,886 --> 01:19:38,278
trying to get you hooked
on some legal shit.

1436
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:43,386
And they just keep naming symptoms till
they get one that you fucking got.

1437
01:19:43,388 --> 01:19:45,267
I think once
I took my first Vicodin

1438
01:19:45,269 --> 01:19:48,631
it was just like this feeling of,
"Aah," you know,

1439
01:19:48,633 --> 01:19:52,864
like everything was not only
mellow but didn't feel any pain,

1440
01:19:52,866 --> 01:19:55,351
it didn't...
It just kind of numbed things.

1441
01:19:55,353 --> 01:19:59,484
I don't know at what point exactly
it started to be a problem,

1442
01:19:59,486 --> 01:20:02,777
I just remember liking it
more and more.

1443
01:20:02,779 --> 01:20:05,095
People tried to tell me
that I had a problem,

1444
01:20:05,097 --> 01:20:06,876
I would say,
"Get that fucking person out of here,

1445
01:20:06,878 --> 01:20:08,657
"I can't believe
they said that shit to me.

1446
01:20:08,659 --> 01:20:09,967
"They know nothing
about my fucking life.

1447
01:20:09,969 --> 01:20:11,714
"Are they out of their fucking mind?

1448
01:20:11,716 --> 01:20:16,452
"I'm not out there fucking,
you know, putting coke up my nose,

1449
01:20:16,454 --> 01:20:17,762
"I'm not smoking crack."

1450
01:20:17,764 --> 01:20:20,451
You're struggling
with the argument of,

1451
01:20:20,453 --> 01:20:22,467
do you have a problem
or do you not have a problem,

1452
01:20:22,469 --> 01:20:24,113
can you control it or can you not,

1453
01:20:24,115 --> 01:20:26,666
and I literally thought
I could control it.

1454
01:20:26,668 --> 01:20:28,582
And for one out of ten people,

1455
01:20:28,584 --> 01:20:31,241
this is how easy it is to fall
into the hands of addiction.

1456
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:36,079
I snorted OxyContin and I remember
just falling down on that couch

1457
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:39,574
and just feeling euphoric,
and feeling that,

1458
01:20:39,576 --> 01:20:43,202
"This is how I should feel,
this is how it should always be."

1459
01:20:43,204 --> 01:20:45,521
I had fun for a lot
of those years.

1460
01:20:45,523 --> 01:20:50,796
But for five or six of them, every time
I did it, it was a freaking nightmare.

1461
01:20:50,798 --> 01:20:52,475
<i>Once you're addicted,</i>

1462
01:20:52,478 --> 01:20:54,224
<i>the drugs become interchangeable.</i>

1463
01:20:54,226 --> 01:20:56,979
You're taking things
that people are giving you

1464
01:20:56,981 --> 01:20:58,961
that you don't even know
what the fuck they are.

1465
01:20:58,963 --> 01:21:04,035
They look like a pill and they're
shaped like something that you take,

1466
01:21:04,037 --> 01:21:05,748
so you take it.

1467
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:09,646
You know. Xanax, Valium,
tomato, tomahto.

1468
01:21:09,648 --> 01:21:11,561
You know what I mean,
it's the same thing.

1469
01:21:11,563 --> 01:21:13,746
All in the same family,
fuck it, take it.

1470
01:21:13,748 --> 01:21:16,534
You know, OxyContin is very
expensive, and I couldn't afford it,

1471
01:21:16,536 --> 01:21:19,928
so eventually a friend said,
"Well, you can do heroin.

1472
01:21:19,930 --> 01:21:24,531
"Heroin's a lot cheaper and you can...
It's easier to get, actually."

1473
01:21:24,533 --> 01:21:26,984
And the cost was huge.

1474
01:21:26,986 --> 01:21:29,571
Beyond the price,
beyond the dollar.

1475
01:21:29,321 --> 01:21:30,636
I started losing my mind,

1476
01:21:30,573 --> 01:21:34,040
I was doing too much cocaine,
becoming too paranoid.

1477
01:21:34,042 --> 01:21:36,762
People started smoking it,
I started smoking it.

1478
01:21:36,764 --> 01:21:43,784
I was sweating, I was shitting,
I was vomiting everywhere,

1479
01:21:43,786 --> 01:21:47,749
and, you know, I said,
"I need to go to a hospital."

1480
01:21:47,751 --> 01:21:51,042
Had I have gotten to the
hospital about two hours later,

1481
01:21:51,044 --> 01:21:52,285
I would have died.

1482
01:21:52,287 --> 01:21:54,973
Having my mom look over me crying,

1483
01:21:54,975 --> 01:21:57,795
over her little baby boy,
in a hospital,

1484
01:21:57,797 --> 01:22:00,954
at 2:00 in the morning,
I just felt like shit.

1485
01:22:00,956 --> 01:22:03,878
My organs were shutting down,
my liver, kidneys, everything.

1486
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,490
They were going to have
to put me on dialysis.

1487
01:22:05,492 --> 01:22:07,170
They didn't think
I was gonna make it.

1488
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:09,018
My bottom was going to be death.

1489
01:22:09,020 --> 01:22:11,303
<i>Within a month, I had relapsed,</i>

1490
01:22:11,845 --> 01:22:14,801
and shot right back up to the same
amount of pills I was taking.

1491
01:22:14,803 --> 01:22:17,422
I remember just walking
around my house

1492
01:22:17,424 --> 01:22:20,984
and thinking every single day
like, I'm gonna fucking die.

1493
01:22:20,986 --> 01:22:24,612
I'm looking at my kids and I
need to be here for this.

1494
01:22:24,614 --> 01:22:26,663
It was everything that I loved.

1495
01:22:26,665 --> 01:22:28,073
And everything that loved me

1496
01:22:28,075 --> 01:22:31,837
was a price that I was
willing to pay to do coke.

1497
01:22:31,839 --> 01:22:33,517
That's a horrible price.

1498
01:22:33,542 --> 01:22:34,752
<i>And for many addicts,</i>

1499
01:22:34,752 --> 01:22:37,045
<i>if they can't afford
to support their habit,</i>

1500
01:22:37,098 --> 01:22:38,549
<i>there is an easy solution.</i>

1501
01:22:38,547 --> 01:22:41,009
I think when you come from a
poor family, you wanna do drugs,

1502
01:22:41,012 --> 01:22:44,639
and drugs cost money,
and then you see a way out.

1503
01:22:44,641 --> 01:22:47,361
OxyContin is very expensive.
And people keep calling you,

1504
01:22:47,363 --> 01:22:49,174
you know, people want drugs.

1505
01:22:49,176 --> 01:22:50,855
And it was hard
not to give them it,

1506
01:22:50,857 --> 01:22:54,047
because I knew I could make
50 dollars just like that.

1507
01:22:54,049 --> 01:22:57,339
The day I ate LSD,
the next day I sold LSD.

1508
01:22:57,341 --> 01:23:00,095
The day I did cocaine,
the next day I sold cocaine.

1509
01:23:00,097 --> 01:23:02,044
The day I shot drugs,
I was selling dope.

1510
01:23:02,046 --> 01:23:04,933
I never meant to get
in the dope business.

1511
01:23:04,935 --> 01:23:07,285
That wasn't my plan.

1512
01:23:07,287 --> 01:23:09,470
But it just started that way.

1513
01:23:09,272 --> 01:23:13,000
Eventually I would make my way
to a Narcotics Anonymous meeting

1514
01:23:13,002 --> 01:23:16,426
and a kid was reading "What is an addict"
and it said very simply,

1515
01:23:16,428 --> 01:23:20,324
"An addict is a man or a woman
whose life is controlled by drugs,

1516
01:23:20,326 --> 01:23:23,314
"in one form or another,
the getting and using,

1517
01:23:23,316 --> 01:23:25,801
"and finding ways and means
to get more."

1518
01:23:25,803 --> 01:23:28,321
And I heard that, and a
light went on in my head.

1519
01:23:28,323 --> 01:23:31,782
I knew I was an addict
for the first time in my life.

1520
01:23:31,784 --> 01:23:34,100
When people asked me,
"What's wrong with you?"

1521
01:23:34,150 --> 01:23:35,744
*** "I'm an addict".

1522
01:23:35,702 --> 01:23:41,190
Coming off of everything, I literally was
up 24 hours a day for 3 weeks straight.

1523
01:23:40,892 --> 01:23:46,938
And I mean, not sleeping, not even
nodding off for a fucking minute.

1524
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:51,105
Like I was literally just up,
looking at the TV.

1525
01:23:51,107 --> 01:23:53,020
I had to regain motor skills,

1526
01:23:53,022 --> 01:23:55,137
I had to regain talking skills.

1527
01:23:55,139 --> 01:23:59,336
It's been a learning process,
like, it's been... I'm growing.

1528
01:23:59,338 --> 01:24:02,764
I just couldn't believe that
anybody could be naturally happy

1529
01:24:02,766 --> 01:24:06,998
or naturally function or be enjoying life
in general without being on something.

1530
01:24:08,344 --> 01:24:13,182
So I would say to anybody
it does get better, you know.

1531
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:15,097
It just, it does.

1532
01:24:16,746 --> 01:24:23,127
<i>Marshall Mathers, Mike Walzman,
Brian O'Dea, and Bobby Carlton</i>

1533
01:24:23,129 --> 01:24:26,790
would take years in and out of treatment
programs before they finally got sober.

1534
01:24:26,792 --> 01:24:30,318
<i>And this is normal.
Addiction is still a modern mystery.</i>

1535
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:33,880
<i>Rehabilitation programs are underfunded,
and often unavailable,</i>

1536
01:24:33,882 --> 01:24:35,997
<i>except for the very rich.</i>

1537
01:24:35,999 --> 01:24:39,424
<i>But in promoting a culture of
addiction and substance abuse,</i>

1538
01:24:39,426 --> 01:24:44,094
drug cartels have an even more powerful
ally than the pharmaceutical industry.

1539
01:24:44,096 --> 01:24:46,379
<i>The number one
gateway drug in the world.</i>

1540
01:24:53,576 --> 01:24:55,659
Yeah, it's the worst
drug on the planet.

1541
01:24:55,661 --> 01:24:59,755
95% of the violent offenses ever
committed by anyone locked up in prison

1542
01:24:59,705 --> 01:25:01,440
was done so under its influence.

1543
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:05,067
<i>And as any addict will tell you,
the quickest way to relapse</i>

1544
01:25:05,069 --> 01:25:08,461
<i>is compromising your judgment
and willpower with alcohol.</i>

1545
01:25:11,956 --> 01:25:14,676
<i>With legal drug companies
promoting drug use,</i>

1546
01:25:14,678 --> 01:25:17,969
<i>it would seem almost impossible to
fight the monster of addiction.</i>

1547
01:25:17,971 --> 01:25:21,229
<i>But there's one industry that's
mastered the art of drug dealing,</i>

1548
01:25:21,231 --> 01:25:25,967
and they know the secret approach that could
threaten the entire addiction market.

1549
01:25:25,969 --> 01:25:30,670
I'm Patrick Reynolds. My grandfather founded the R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Company.

1550
01:25:31,713 --> 01:25:35,341
<i>My only memories of my dad were
of a man dying from smoking.</i>

1551
01:25:37,761 --> 01:25:42,095
<i>Tobacco is killing more than a
combined total of all the murders,</i>

1552
01:25:42,097 --> 01:25:44,010
<i>all the drugs, all the suicides,</i>

1553
01:25:44,012 --> 01:25:45,924
and all car accidents combined.

1554
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:50,763
Throw AIDS in, tobacco is
killing more than the total.

1555
01:25:50,765 --> 01:25:52,746
If tobacco were banned tomorrow,

1556
01:25:52,748 --> 01:25:57,080
and the DEA was going to
come after you for smoking,

1557
01:25:57,082 --> 01:26:00,239
the first thing it would do is it
would make it really cool to kids.

1558
01:26:00,241 --> 01:26:03,532
We'd have a black market tobacco,

1559
01:26:03,534 --> 01:26:07,396
there would be tobacco probably
manufactured in Mexico,

1560
01:26:07,398 --> 01:26:11,394
or some other country and imported...
They'd find their way.

1561
01:26:11,396 --> 01:26:13,881
We know what works
for fighting tobacco.

1562
01:26:13,883 --> 01:26:16,367
Smoking bans in public places,

1563
01:26:16,369 --> 01:26:20,399
<i>high tobacco taxes, secession
programs, education,</i>

1564
01:26:21,576 --> 01:26:23,423
<i>and banning tobacco advertising.</i>

1565
01:26:26,282 --> 01:26:28,768
<i>What would happen
if we used the same approach</i>

1566
01:26:28,770 --> 01:26:32,027
<i>Patrick Reynolds described
succeeding with cigarettes</i>

1567
01:26:32,029 --> 01:26:34,009
and applied that to all drugs?

1568
01:26:34,011 --> 01:26:38,109
That approach was tried in Portugal,
which had a huge drug problem,

1569
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,128
and the effort crashed the black market.

1570
01:26:40,111 --> 01:26:45,401
<i>NBC sent reporters to study the drop in
addiction and abuse rates among teens.</i>

1571
01:26:45,403 --> 01:26:48,324
So have you ever used hashish?
No, never.

1572
01:26:48,326 --> 01:26:50,441
Why not? It's bad for us.

1573
01:26:53,129 --> 01:26:55,380
<i>Portuguese Prime Minister
Jose Socrates</i>

1574
01:26:55,382 --> 01:26:57,631
<i>was one of the architects
of the new policy,</i>

01:26:57,633 --> 01:26:59,546
<i>has some advice
for the rest of us.</i>

1576
01:27:02,707 --> 01:27:04,721
I think the strategy can work
in any country,

1577
01:27:04,774 --> 01:27:06,069
you just need to rid yourself

1578
01:27:06,023 --> 01:27:09,223
<i>of prejudice and take an
intelligent approach.</i>

1579
01:27:09,225 --> 01:27:11,508
<i>Even America's current
drug czar admits</i>

1580
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:14,095
<i>that law enforcement
isn't the answer to drugs.</i>

1581
01:27:14,097 --> 01:27:17,623
If you read the research, you
clearly and quickly come to realize

1582
01:27:17,596 --> 01:27:19,082
that addiction is a desease.

1583
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:22,260
I think for too long we probably
thought we could either

1584
01:27:22,262 --> 01:27:24,444
arrest our way out of the problem,

1585
01:27:24,446 --> 01:27:28,342
or solve it through some
criminal justice lens,

1586
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,746
and I think we know from past
history that is not the case.

1587
01:27:32,672 --> 01:27:35,210
<i>Critics call the war on drugs</i>

1588
01:27:33,428 --> 01:27:39,743
<i>the single greatest public policy
failure of the last 50 years.</i>

1589
01:27:39,745 --> 01:27:41,694
The DEA don't want
the drug problem to stop.

1590
01:27:41,696 --> 01:27:44,213
District attorneys don't want
the problem to stop.

1591
01:27:44,215 --> 01:27:47,539
Prisons don't want the drug problem to stop.
They're pushing it on.

1592
01:27:48,650 --> 01:27:52,546
The only person who's
paying is the taxpayers.

1593
01:27:52,548 --> 01:27:57,250
<i>Freeway Rick Ross and Brian O'Dea
continue to give inspirational speeches</i>

1594
01:27:57,252 --> 01:27:59,838
<i>on the dangers of addiction and
the failures of prohibition.</i>

1595
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:03,703
<i>I was sentenced to 10 years.
Within an hour and a half,</i>

1596
01:28:03,705 --> 01:28:08,273
<i>I met guys in there who were
doing 75 years for pot.</i>

1597
01:28:08,275 --> 01:28:10,659
<i>One of these guys
has since died in prison.</i>

1598
01:28:10,661 --> 01:28:13,212
<i>And the other guys are
gonna die in prison.</i>

1599
01:28:13,214 --> 01:28:16,572
But I got the government selling me
cigarettes in there for 50 cents a pack.

1600
01:28:19,262 --> 01:28:25,375
Don't make sense, does it?
Didn't to me. Didn't to me.

1601
01:28:27,461 --> 01:28:30,182
<i>Bobby Carlton,
now clean for over a decade,</i>

1602
01:28:30,184 --> 01:28:32,534
<i>runs a sober living house
in Los Angeles,</i>

1603
01:28:32,597 --> 01:28:34,325
<i>and helps other addicts get clean.</i>

1604
01:28:34,325 --> 01:28:38,179
You know, it's just the money is so stupid
that everybody's a part of the problem,

1605
01:28:38,181 --> 01:28:45,639
<i>Big John now works as a union electrician
and earns over six figures a year.</i>

1606
01:28:45,641 --> 01:28:49,133
<i>He and Skipp Townsend volunteer
as community activists</i>

1607
01:28:49,135 --> 01:28:52,194
<i>and gang intervention specialists
in Southern California.</i>

1608
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:55,451
I understand that I can't do any
better unless I know better.

1609
01:28:55,453 --> 01:28:58,978
And so for the most part when
individuals ask me for a job,

1610
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:00,894
I understand that nine out of ten,

1611
01:29:00,933 --> 01:29:02,592
they are not even ready to get a job.

1612
01:29:02,496 --> 01:29:07,076
It's just what they're sayin'. But they're
gonna revert back to what comes easiest.

1613
01:29:07,078 --> 01:29:09,596
The current takes the path
of least resistance.

1614
01:29:09,598 --> 01:29:14,536
So, what's the easiest, what's
the easiest path? That's drugs.

1615
01:29:14,538 --> 01:29:17,661
After a friend of his was
killed by one of the cartels,

1616
01:29:17,663 --> 01:29:20,079
<i>Pepe left the game.
For the time being.</i>

1617
01:29:20,081 --> 01:29:24,347
Right now I'm a painter.
A simple painter.

1618
01:29:26,062 --> 01:29:32,311
And this... I enjoy my life right now,
I'm fine. But I know the way to make it.

1619
01:29:32,313 --> 01:29:35,166
If one day I need to, I will go.

1620
01:29:35,168 --> 01:29:37,552
<i>Barry Cooper,
after constant arrests</i>

1621
01:29:37,554 --> 01:29:39,535
<i>and raids on his family's home,</i>

1622
01:29:39,434 --> 01:29:41,397
<i>is now seeking political asylum</i>

1623
01:29:41,397 --> 01:29:45,285
<i>outside the United States where
he continues to dedicate his life</i>

1624
01:29:45,301 --> 01:29:47,233
<i>vending the US drug war.</i>

1625
01:29:47,285 --> 01:29:52,874
I'm not going to use our energy to try and
change the minds of the old Americans

1626
01:29:52,876 --> 01:29:56,973
that made the laws and expect
us to live under those laws.

1627
01:29:59,226 --> 01:30:03,290
I'm going to use our energy to rally
the masses who already get it.

1628
01:30:04,169 --> 01:30:08,434
<i>And Neill Franklin, after 30
years fighting the war on drugs,</i>

1629
01:30:08,436 --> 01:30:11,022
<i>is now the executive
director of LEAP,</i>

1630
01:30:11,024 --> 01:30:13,240
<i>an organization of law enforcement</i>

1631
01:30:13,242 --> 01:30:16,331
<i>who are demanding an end
to the drug war.</i>

1632
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:21,237
It wasn't until after his retirement
that Neill Franklin chose to speak out.

1633
01:30:21,239 --> 01:30:25,235
What I have here is referred to as,
in law enforcement, as a shadow box.

1634
01:30:26,681 --> 01:30:31,317
<i>And it basically contains the law
enforcement officer's career.</i>

1635
01:30:31,319 --> 01:30:33,737
<i>And in my retirement celebration,</i>

1636
01:30:33,739 --> 01:30:37,500
<i>this was presented to me
by Ed Toatley.</i>

1637
01:30:37,502 --> 01:30:41,532
<i>Ed Toatley was probably
the best narcotics agent</i>

1638
01:30:41,534 --> 01:30:44,825
<i>that the Maryland state
police had ever seen.</i>

1639
01:30:44,827 --> 01:30:49,697
<i>Ed Toatley was assassinated
in October 2000 by a drug dealer.</i>

1640
01:30:54,975 --> 01:30:58,501
You get killed in this thing, I'll be
like, my generation died in Vietnam.

1641
01:30:58,503 --> 01:31:03,104
It's perhaps heroic, but it's
absolutely without meaning.

1642
01:31:03,106 --> 01:31:08,649
<i>Because whether you make the five
kilogram bust, 500 kilos, a truck load.</i>

1643
01:31:08,651 --> 01:31:11,505
<i>None of it makes any difference.</i>

1644
01:31:11,507 --> 01:31:15,638
Drug dealers and cops
are replaced just like that.

1645
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:20,174
<i>People losing parents, people losing sons,
people losing daughters.</i>

1646
01:31:21,385 --> 01:31:24,609
<i>You know,
Ed's kid's lost a father.</i>

1647
01:31:24,611 --> 01:31:27,902
And those who are involved
in the illegal activity,

1648
01:31:29,314 --> 01:31:32,875
because you know what,
their lives are just as important.

1649
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:42,722
<i>If we decriminalized all drugs,</i>

1650
01:31:42,724 --> 01:31:45,779
<i>we would have billions
of dollars to battle addiction,</i>

1651
01:31:45,781 --> 01:31:48,199
<i>drug abuse and poverty.</i>

1652
01:31:50,787 --> 01:31:53,305
<i>But as long as we support
a drug war,</i>

1653
01:31:53,307 --> 01:31:57,002
we will continue to encourage
our children to pick up the game

1654
01:31:57,004 --> 01:32:00,765
<i>and discover for themselves
how to make money selling drugs.</i>
