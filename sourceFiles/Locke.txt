They gave me an assistant.

210
00:13:43,431 --> 00:13:46,099
She worked with me on
the block construction.

211
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,686
- She?
- She was a secretary, quite old.

212

We, uh... We worked together.

213
00:13:55,276 --> 00:13:57,277
She's quite old and
she lives on her own.

She's 43 or something.

215

me about some woman?

This is the only time I ever did
this, Katrina. The only time.

218
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,438
Look, after the block was settled in,
there were some drinks to celebrate.

219

Now, the block going in is a big thing
because it's the base of a whole building.

to the guesthouse.

She isn't what you would
call an oil painting,

222
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:29,935
but it was wet and cold, and
she talked about being lonely

223
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,645
and I talked about being happy.

know, when I was away, and...

this in all our 15 years.

the pumps on the Argyll side,

336
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,221

pissing it out.

No, listen... Okay,
stop, stop, stop.

338
00:22:05,182 --> 00:22:08,810
Listen, when you get back on site,
you check every pump yourself,

339

individually and with your
own hand on the turner.

340
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:13,982
You don't ask anybody else
to check and sign off.

341
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:18,361
You go around the whole site and
you check each one yourself.

342
00:22:18,362 --> 00:22:23,408
And you don't trust Alby after
5:00 because he drinks, okay?

- Okay, okay.
- Now, will you talk to me about the mix?

344
00:22:27,288 --> 00:22:31,291

Did we say C6?

like it's a question.

Okay, yes, okay.

like a question and it's not a question.

348
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:41,718
Well, all the mixes for the pump
will be C6. Why do you even ask?

- It's written on the whiteboard...
- I'm not asking.

all over the cabin in big red letters.

492
00:30:55,379 --> 00:30:58,256
But I just got off the phone
with the plant in Stafford,

493
00:30:58,257 --> 00:31:00,633
and they said they know
that it's a C6 mix,

494
00:31:00,634 --> 00:31:03,778
but how far towards C5 can it go?

495
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:07,807
In other words, if one
truck had some C5,

496
00:31:07,808 --> 00:31:10,486
how bad would that be taken?

497
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:16,287
Are you still there?

498
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:22,122
Donal, what does it say
on the whiteboard?

499
00:31:23,323 --> 00:31:25,199
On the... It says C6.

500
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,202
What does it say on every piece of
paperwork and on every sign-off sheet?

501
00:31:28,203 --> 00:31:30,972
- It says C6.
- I says C6.

502
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,717
And you know why?

503
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:39,171
Because, eventually, when my building
is complete, it will be 55 floors high.

504
00:31:39,172 --> 00:31:43,968
It will weigh 2,223,000
metric tons.

505
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:47,318
Okay? My building will alter the
water table and squeeze granite.

506
00:31:47,514 --> 00:31:50,433
It will be visible
from 20 miles away.

507
00:31:50,434 --> 00:31:53,519
At sunset, it will cast a
shadow probably a mile long.

508
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,482
Now, if the concrete at the base
of my building is not right,

509
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:02,695
if it slips half an
inch, cracks appear.

510
00:32:02,696 --> 00:32:06,198
Right? If cracks appear, then they
will grow and grow, won't they?

511
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:08,492
- And the whole thing will collapse.
- Ivan, look...

512
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:12,705
You make one mistake, Donal,
one little fucking mistake,

513

crashing down around you.

So you tell Stafford, C6.

Um... A nice bottle of fizzy pop.

There's no need for you to
talk to me like that, okay?

692
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,115
Because I've got six calls
here that I'm looking at

693

and I'm guessing what they are

694

and what he's saying to
me on the phone calls.

695
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:56,788
But I agreed that I'm not gonna
take those phone calls from Gareth

you know, about tomorrow going pear,

I'm gonna listen to.

that hungry at the moment.

Pick up the phone.

982
00:58:13,265 --> 00:58:14,908
Pick up the phone.

983
00:58:16,101 --> 00:58:18,769
- CASSIDY: Hello?
- Ah, Mr. Cassidy?

984
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:21,731
It's Ivan Locke from
the Park project.

985
00:58:21,732 --> 00:58:22,940
Uh, who?

986
00:58:22,941 --> 00:58:27,111
I'm running the site at Claremount.
We've some road closures agreed.

987
00:58:27,112 --> 00:58:29,906
- How did you get this number?
- You gave it to me.

988
00:58:29,907 --> 00:58:32,033
You gave it to me in case
anything came up over Christmas.

989
00:58:32,034 --> 00:58:35,578
- Yeah, well, it's not Christmas.
- Yes, but I need a sign-off.

990
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:39,457
- I'm in an Indian restaurant.
- Yes, but I need a sign-off.

991
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:42,710
- Seriously, I need it.
- I told you, I'm in an Indian restaurant.

992
00:58:42,711 --> 00:58:46,797
Okay, if I give you the number of the duty
officer at the Belmount Police Station...

993
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:48,549
- This'll have to wait. Sorry.
- (LINE DISCONNECTS)

994
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:50,301
- No, please. Shit.
- (DIALING)

995
00:58:50,302 --> 00:58:52,136
- No, please, please, please.
- No.

996
00:58:52,137 --> 00:58:54,305
- Please. Please... No.
- This will have to wait.

997
00:58:54,306 --> 00:58:56,724
Without this... It can't wait.

998
00:58:56,725 --> 00:58:59,352
- Concrete is coming tomorrow.
- I'm in a bloody Indian restaurant!

999
00:58:59,353 --> 00:59:01,062
Yes, I know, I know,
and I'm really sorry.

1000
00:59:01,063 --> 00:59:05,459
Please. I just need you, please,
to call the duty officer.

1001
00:59:09,154 --> 00:59:11,752
- You're Ivan Locke?
- Yes.

1002
00:59:12,866 --> 00:59:16,118
(SIGHING) Uh-huh. I remember
you. You ran a tight ship.

1003
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:17,328
Yes.

1004
00:59:17,329 --> 00:59:21,290
The only construction director who
gave us paperwork ahead of time.

1005
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:24,669
Yes, yes, but tonight, I'm
sorry, things have just...

1006
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:27,393
They've happened beyond my control.

1007
00:59:28,256 --> 00:59:29,799
Okay, okay, okay.

1008
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,176
- Give me the bloody number.
- Thank you.

1009
00:59:32,177 --> 00:59:37,608
Okay. 07957-452...

1010
00:59:46,692 --> 00:59:50,403
You know, I could have easily
let the concrete go to hell,

1011
00:59:50,404 --> 00:59:52,196
but I didn't.

1012
00:59:52,197 --> 00:59:55,700
You know, Dad, when you came creeping
back, saying you were sorry,

1013
00:59:55,701 --> 00:59:58,424
it was even worse
than staying away.

1014
00:59:58,704 --> 01:00:00,371
Yes, I'm serious.

1015
01:00:00,372 --> 01:00:04,667
I could have broken your fucking
back for that, but I didn't.

1016
01:00:04,668 --> 01:00:08,796
And the fact that I could have done it
was worse than anything, you know?

1017
01:00:08,797 --> 01:00:11,465
Because you were so fucking weak.

1018
01:00:11,466 --> 01:00:15,691
That was the first thing
I noticed. So weak.

1019
01:00:16,513 --> 01:00:22,616
All the things I fucking despise
inside one fucking stupid green shirt.

1020
01:00:22,769 --> 01:00:24,979
IVAN: You looked pathetic.

1021
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:28,607
My fucking dad in... What
were they? They were trainers.

1022
01:00:28,608 --> 01:00:33,696
They were some son' of fucking
trainers that teenagers wear.

1023
01:00:33,697 --> 01:00:35,906
And your hair was
all over the place.

1024
01:00:35,907 --> 01:00:39,827
You don't drink anymore and
you don't fucking smoke dope.

1025
01:00:39,828 --> 01:00:43,914
We're all supposed to celebrate, is
that it? Celebrate what, exactly?

1026
01:00:43,915 --> 01:00:45,750
- (CAR PHONE RINGING)
- I was 23 years old

1027
01:00:45,751 --> 01:00:49,128
and this old cunt comes
from the fucking blue sky.

1028
01:00:49,129 --> 01:00:52,899
He says, "Guess what,
everybody. I've..."

1029
01:00:53,717 --> 01:00:54,842
- What?
- DONAL: Ivan.

1030
01:00:54,843 --> 01:00:57,053
- What?
- Ivan, it's all going to hell.

1031
01:00:57,054 --> 01:00:58,596
What?

1032
01:00:58,597 --> 01:01:03,601
The rebars in the shuttering in pit six,
they wouldn't hold a fucking kitten's fan'.

1033
01:01:03,602 --> 01:01:06,979
It's those mavericks from up north
we put in there at the last minute.

1034
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:09,774
- What tension did they hold?
- They hold nothing!

1035
01:01:09,775 --> 01:01:12,109
They hold nothing at all.
It came away with a push.

1036
01:01:12,110 --> 01:01:13,611
Is there anybody there?

1037
01:01:13,612 --> 01:01:16,711
No, shutterers all went home
ages ago. They're not in till 6:00.

1038
01:01:20,285 --> 01:01:22,703
- Right, call the Albanian.
- No, I've tried the Albanian.

1039
01:01:22,704 --> 01:01:24,789
He's not answering. Nobody's
answering. Nobody's answering.

1040
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:28,094
There's some fucking
football game on!

1041
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:33,130
- Could you call in your sons?
- (STAMMERS) No, they're in Germany.

1042
01:01:33,131 --> 01:01:37,061
- They're digging out missile silos.
- Okay, okay, Donal. Here's what you do.

1043
01:01:37,803 --> 01:01:41,263
You drive down to the ring road
near the fire station, okay?

1044
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:43,641
And you'll see a road
gang laying lines.

1045
01:01:43,642 --> 01:01:46,644
You ask for a guy called
Stefan. He's Polish.

1046
01:01:46,645 --> 01:01:51,232
Tell him there's 500 pounds for
him and two of his best diggers

1047
01:01:51,233 --> 01:01:53,651
if they can get down and
fix up some rebars.

1048
01:01:53,652 --> 01:01:55,027
A road gang?

1049
01:01:55,028 --> 01:01:57,154
Yes, I know. But I know
them. I know them.

1050
01:01:57,155 --> 01:02:00,950
They're slumming it for the cash. Stefan
is the best concrete farmer I know.

1051
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:03,970
Now, you mention my
name. He owes me.

1052
01:02:07,332 --> 01:02:11,057
So, do I have to drive down there?
Can I not just ring them?

1053
01:02:12,254 --> 01:02:15,148
Donal, how many
ciders have you had?

1054
01:02:16,007 --> 01:02:17,684
Donal?

1055
01:02:18,426 --> 01:02:21,512
Donal, I don't have Stefan's number.
You'll need to drive down there.

1056
01:02:21,513 --> 01:02:24,849
They'll be knocking off and going
home in, like, half an hour.

1057
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:27,309
Okay, Ivan, I'm gonna
be straight with you.

1058
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,283
I'm not drunk.

1059
01:02:30,272 --> 01:02:33,649
I'm not drunk, okay, but I've had
too much to get behind a wheel.

1060
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:36,499
If I get stopped
again, I go inside.

1061
01:02:37,445 --> 01:02:39,747
And I can't do that.

1062
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,628
Okay, then you run.

1063
01:02:45,453 --> 01:02:46,704
- I run?
- Yeah.

1064
01:02:46,705 --> 01:02:51,500
Stefan and his men will knock off in
half an hour due to council regulations

1065
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:54,044
because they can't burn
bitumen lights after 10:00.

1066
01:02:54,045 --> 01:02:56,380
So if you run, you'll get there
before they get in their van.

1067
01:02:56,381 --> 01:02:58,215
What do you mean, run?
I'm not gonna fucking run.

1068
01:02:58,216 --> 01:03:00,092
You will fucking run, Donal.

1069
01:03:00,093 --> 01:03:02,845
- I haven't... I'm not...
- You will fucking run now.

1070
01:03:02,846 --> 01:03:05,222
Go, or my building won't get built.

- Are you mad?
- Yes.

- Run? I'm not...
- Yes, I'm mad.

1074

have to get used to being mad.

And Donal...

1077
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:20,696
- I can hear in your voice when you're drunk.
- I'm not.

1078
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:23,115
No, but when you're drunk,
you can run faster, can't you?

1079
01:03:23,116 --> 01:03:25,743
For a while at least. You
can run like a fucking kid.

1080
01:03:25,744 --> 01:03:28,913
- You can run like the fucking wind.
- (LAUGHING)

1081
01:03:28,914 --> 01:03:31,373
So I'm gonna get out of my
boots and put on my trainers?

1082
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:33,918
- My run-fast trainers?
- Yes, yes. Then you run.

1083
01:03:33,919 --> 01:03:37,254
So you want me to run? Run for
those fucking bastards in Chicago

1084
01:03:37,255 --> 01:03:39,089
who don't give a shit
if I live or if I die?

1085
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:44,094
No, you do it for the piece of sky
we are stealing with our building.

1086
01:03:44,095 --> 01:03:46,430
You do it for the air
that will be displaced,

1087
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:49,225
and most of all you do it
for the fucking concrete.

1088
01:03:49,226 --> 01:03:51,101
Because it is delicate as blood.

1089
01:03:51,102 --> 01:03:53,604
You really have gone
fucking mad, right?

1090
01:03:53,605 --> 01:03:56,357
Well, that would be a
fair assessment, yes.

1091
01:03:56,358 --> 01:03:58,609
(LAUGHING) All right.

1092
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:00,527
Whoo! Whoo!

1093
01:04:00,528 --> 01:04:03,739
- Right, Ivan, here I go! Whoo! Whoo!
- Oh, you're a good man, Donal.

1094
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:07,089
You are, you're a good man.
Go on now, run. Run!

1095
01:04:07,786 --> 01:04:10,663
It will work out.
I will make sure of it.

1096

You'll see. You'll see.

1097
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:14,959
You see, you take things
in your own hands,

1098

and you push against it and you
push against it until it's upright.

01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:29,429
Mum was crying, so she
didn't even see it.

1305
01:17:30,588 --> 01:17:36,051
Um, but we recorded it for you, so you
have to come home and watch it, okay?

1306
01:17:36,052 --> 01:17:40,013
You have to come home,
and I have an idea, okay?

1307
01:17:40,014 --> 01:17:43,683
So, we'll pretend we
don't know the score

1308
01:17:43,684 --> 01:17:47,771
and pretend it's happening
then, pretend it's live.

1309
01:17:47,772 --> 01:17:51,274
And me and Sean will go mad all the
same, and you can have your beer

1310
01:17:51,275 --> 01:17:54,374
and Mum can make the
sausages, so...

1311
01:17:54,695 --> 01:17:57,089
So, that's what we'll do.

1312
01:17:58,324 --> 01:18:00,422
Good night, Dad.

1316
01:18:45,996 --> 01:18:48,298
Is everything okay?

1317
01:18:51,752 --> 01:18:53,002
Listen.

Ivan, will you come?

Yes.
