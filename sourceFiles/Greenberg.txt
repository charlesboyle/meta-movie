4
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,080
Are you going to
let me in?

5
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,168
Thank you.

6
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,358
Shoot, l left the ticket
in the car, l think.

7
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,069
lt's okay.
lt's under
"Phillip Greenberg."

8
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,279
lt's just one?

9
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,240
lt's two shirts
and a pair of pants.

10
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,752
Do you mind if
it is all ones?

11
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,379
No problem.
Okay, sorry.

12
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,042
Florence.

13
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,460
Hi, guys.

14
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,087
Let me put
this stuff down.

15
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,172
Hi, Mahler.
Florence!

16
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,549
We're going on vacation !

17
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,592
l know.

18
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,760
We're going to Vietnam.
l know.

19
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:42,179
But we will come back, right?
We're not going
to live there?

20
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,973
No, that's why
it's a vacation.

21
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,641
Are you going
to go with us?

22
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,352
No, remember?
l have to stay here.
Why?

23
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,104
Because l do.
Why?

24
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,899
Because the vacation
is for family members only,

25
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,067
so Mahler and l
have to stay in LA.

26
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,988
Mahler isn't coming?
l want Mahler to come.

27
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,074
Did you get
the neck pillow?

28
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,994
Yes. They didn't have
those chocolate-covered
rice balls.

29
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,120
Did you try Trader Joe's?

30
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,747
Yeah, and Bristol Farms.

31
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,875
Were you able to find
the liquid decongestant?

32
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,461
Shoot! Sorry. l'm sorry.

33
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,129
lt's okay, Florence.
Don't worry about it.

34
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,380
lt's fine.
No, no, no.

35
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,931
And can you tell the gardener
to check the sensor
on the sprinklers?

36
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:25,973
l'll tell Carlos.

37
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,058
There's a package
l need you to mail

38
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,225
to my father.
What else?

39
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,810
l don't need
this many T-shirts.

40
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,437
Did you tell her
about your brother?

41
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,563
My brother will
be staying here.

42
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,065
He might call
you with things,

43
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,524
questions or
an errand or two.

44
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:36,943
That's not a problem.
He's coming in
from New York.

45
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,611
He just got out
of the hospital.
ls he sick?

46
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,613
Not that kind of hospital.
He had a nervous breakdown.

47
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,490
Carol, come on.
lt's relevant.
He's fine.

48
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,283
Don't pack this skirt.
He really is fine now.

49
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,077
l mean,
he's delicate,
but. . .

50
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,745
We're hiring him to do
some work around the house.

51
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,748
He's a carpenter.
He's gonna make
Mahler a dog house.

52
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:51,874
He says he's going to.

53
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,751
That'll look nice.
We hope.

54
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,086
Have a great trip,
you guys.

55
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,379
Okay.

56
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,174
And l'll call you if
there's anything else,
which l'm sure there is.

57
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,300
lt's no problem.
l want you
to come with us.

58
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,970
And you'll confirm
the car service and
flight info for tonight?

59
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,472
Yes, and l'll put
the cars in the garage.

60
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,182
Okay, and we can
call or e-mail.

61
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,517
l'm sure there's
e-mail in Vietnam.

62
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:10,935
l think there's
e-mail everywhere.

63
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,646
l forgot to
write you a check.
What do we owe you now?

64
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,731
Don't worry about it.
lt's three weeks. . .

65
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,150
Oh, Florence,
you have to speak up.
l'm out of checks.

66
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,652
l want Mahler to come.
l know, l know,

67
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,113
but it's fine.
l'll give you
cash in the meantime.

68
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,407
No, no. Don't worry
about it. lt's really. . .
lt's better this way.

69
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,783
Because then l don't
spend it all at once.

70
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,576
Are you sure?
l'll leave it for you
in the kitchen drawer

71
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:28,828
before we go.
l'll let my brother know.
Okay.

72
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,287
Okay.
Bye.

73
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,415
Okay.
l'll see you soon.

74
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,667
lt's okay.
Let's say goodbye.
Bye.

75
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,127
Bye, Florence.

76
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,336
Bye.

77
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,716
Florence, itis Gina.
l'm here. lt's packed.

78
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,802
Don't park on Alvarado,
park on Montana.

79
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:45,886
Don't wander away.

80
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,013
Okay.

81
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,057
Let's make a point
of sticking together.

82
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,434
Okay.

83
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,936
Can l borrow 40
bucks until tomorrow?
Yeah.

84
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,960
l was thinking
this morning that l've been
out of college now

85
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,129
for as long as l was in,

86
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,425
and nobody cares if l
get up in the morning.

87
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,229
Florence,
it's time to go home now.

88
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,857
l'm gonna stay.

89
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,284
l don't know. . .

90
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,705
l just got out of
a long relationship.

91
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,666
This isn't a relationship.

92
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,879
Right, l know.

93
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:03,798
Okay.

94
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,310
Are you going to
let me in?

95
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,480
No. Okay.

96
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,659
Hello?
Hi, this is
Roger Greenberg.

97
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,619
l'm Phillip's brother.

98
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,163
Oh, hey.

99
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,582
ls this Florence?

100
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,877
Sorry.
l'm quitting e-mail.

101
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,046
Okay. Hi.

102
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,551
There are people in the pool.

103
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,761
That's Marlon and Peggy.

104
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,513
Okay.

105
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:38,017
Your brother and Carol
let Marlon and Peggy
use the pool.

106
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,101
Mmm-hmm.

107
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,020
There's more than two.

108
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,022
They don't come in the house.

109
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,773
Okay, thanks.

110
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,612
Your brother
left a check for me.
ls it okay if l come by?

111
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,782
Yeah, l'll be here.

112
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,739
"Dear
American Airlines,

113
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,533
"l'm not much in
the habit of writing
letters of complaint.

114
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:37,993
"l think l could
have lived, and did,

115
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,120
"with the distance
between your rows.

116
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,289
"But my issue is not
with the lack of leg room,

117
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,959
"it is instead
with the quality of the
buttons on the seats.

118
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,502
"When l depress
my recliner button,

119
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,462
"l expect the chair

120
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,172
"At the very least,

121
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:54,510
"This was not the case
with Seat 26C on
Flight 41 from JFK..."

122
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,059
Hi, little Mahler baby.

123
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,604
Hi, l'm Florence.
l hope that this
isn't a bad time.

124
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:06,814
My check.

125
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,107
No, l guess it's fine.

126
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,608
Okay.

127
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,319
Do you want a treat?

128
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,989
Come here. Come here.

129
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,077
His tongue's so scratchy.

130
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,496
Good dog.

131
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,010
Remember how they used
to play this on the radio
every time it rained?

132
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,636
l'm not sure.

133
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:43,183
And if there was a fire,
they'd play Burn Baby Burn.

134
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,894
Or, what was it called?

135
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,730
Disco lnferno.

136
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,069
l don't think l know it.

137
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,487
lt's funny.

138
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,536
Before your time,
l guess.

139
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,581
You have to see
past the kitsch.

140
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,544
l can see past it.

141
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,596
Cool.

142
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,058
Phillip said if
you need anything,

143
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,269
l can go pick you up
groceries or things.

144
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,023
l'm okay.
You sure?
lt's not a problem.

145
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,860
Well, l guess l
could use some things.

146
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,322
Sure.
Make a list.
l'll be right back.

147
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,848
l'm gonna take
him on a W-A-L-K.

148
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,809
Oh, no. No, l got it.

149
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,478
Okay, cool.

150
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,813
Bye.

151
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,043
This is lvan. Leave a message
after the tone.

152
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,881
lvan, it's Greenberg.
How you doing, man?

153
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,717
l'm in LA.

154
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,596
l'm here, actually.
ln from New York City.

155
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,476
So, give me a call.
l'm staying at my
brother's house.

156
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,227
He's in Vietnam.

157
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,648
l think he's
opening a hotel there
or something.

158
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,943
Give me a call, man.
lt'd be great to see you.

159
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:54,935
"Dear Mayor Bloomberg,

160
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,771
"l write as
a concerned citizen
that has finally had enough

161

162
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,276
"lf you placed

here in Manhattan."

170
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,629
lt's true.
No one really honks here.

171
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:25,674
Yeah. ln LA,
they understand the horn
is for emergencies only.

172
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,467

it's a constant.
Yeah.

l don't really recognize
New York anymore, you know?

174
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,139
"You might be
interested to know

175
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,933
"that in the relatively
recently acquired
state of Hawaii,

176
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:39,521
"there's a law on the books
that prohibits the honking
of horns entirely.

177
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:44,151
"Yours in hopes
of green sound,
Roger Greenberg."

178
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,111
When did you get in?

179
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,864
Only Monday.
You're the first
person l called.

180
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,450
No, l didn't mean. . .
No, l know.
l was just saying.

181
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,869
Right.
How long you staying for?

182
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,329
About six weeks.

183
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,788
Can you imagine
going to Vietnam?

184
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:57,914
What, to fight?

185
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,958
Well, to fight, too,
but l just meant now.

186
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:02,294
My brother and his wife
are there on vacation.

187
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,920
l don't know.

188
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,465
Some people like to travel.

189
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,260
That's my brother's
wife's daughter, Sara.

190
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,554
My step-sister?

191
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,306
Niece.

192
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,683
She's at UC Santa Cruz.

193
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,312
Uh, no, thanks, man.
l don't really
drink anymore.

194
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:23,607
Okay.

195
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,400
Yeah, it's for the best.

196
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,236
l've got into
these Arnold Palmers.
lced tea, lemonade.

197
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,821
Yeah, l don't have that.

198
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,823
l thought l'd told you.

199
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,951
l guess l think we
talk more than we do.

200
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,499
The beard is cool.
Yeah.

201
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,709
You know,
it's a winter beard.

202
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,257
l probably shouldn't
be on the table here.

203
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,719
Maybe don't sit
on the speaker.

204
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,221
Oh, sorry.

205
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,850
So, what do you
want to do today?

206
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,521
Um, Beller's having
a barbeque, which means,
you know. . .

207
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,481
Oh, what's he up to?

208
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:08,193
He directs television.
He calls me up with
computer questions.

209
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,528
What a dick.

210
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:10,696
He always offers to pay.

211
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,656
Yeah, still rude.

212
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,286
Let's not do that.

213
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,122
Uh. . .

214
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,957
What else, man?

215
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,961
We could get
a drink at a bar,
we could stay here.

216
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,463
They have videos.
Yeah.

217
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,091
l think l saw Mannequin.

218
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,218
And, uh, Gung Ho?

219
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,137
l remember that
being funny.

220
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,972
Gung Ho's good.
Yeah.

221
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,349
lt'd be interesting
to watch it now.

222
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:40,851
ln the day?

223
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,563
l meant now,
like, you know. . .

224
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:45,689
Oh, these days. Yeah.
Now,

225
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:46,940
as opposed to
when it was made.
Yeah, sorry.

226
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,864
l'm not sure
about these pants.
They look flarey to you?

227
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,074
No, l think
that's the style.

228
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,243
l feel like
l should have
worn jeans.

229
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,245
No one's going
to be dressed up
at this thing.

230
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:05,417
Fabula and l are on
this trial separation.

231
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,003
Oh. Uh-huh.

232
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,882
lt's a lot to go into.

233
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,800
l feel terrible
for Victor, you know.

234
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,761
l'd love you to meet him.
He's like
a little person now.

235
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,429
Yeah, l saw him
a few years ago.

236
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:22,017
Yeah, but now he's eight.
He's like a friend.
He's fun to hang out with.

237
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,645
l'm glad you're here, man.

238
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,732
lt's good for me to
get out like this.

239
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,859
Want to put your blinker on?

240
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,284
Casa de Beller.

241
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,495
Keep going. Keep going.

242
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,497
Keep going.

243
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,751
What a fucking nightmare.

244
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,127
Maybe we can park here.

245
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,378
No, no, no. Let's go home.

246
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,423
l shouldn't have let
you talk me into this.
lt's a nightmare here.

247
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,091
lt's this kind of shit. . .

248
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,844
l can't find a movie
l want to go to
in the fucking multiplex,

249
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:01,223
or when l'm in Starbucks,
l hear music l actually like.

250
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,600
But we drove all
the way out here.
Let's have one drink.

251
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,530
ls this a fucking
children's party?

252
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,786
Beller, how are you?

253
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,037
l'm good.

254
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,247
Hey, man.
Johno.

255
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,415
Hey, Greenberg,
what are you doing out here?

256
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
You know. . .

257
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,961
Hey, Beth.
Oh, my God. Hey.

258
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,256
Should l know?
Are you really
big or something?

259
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,633
No, Megan.

260
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,134
l didn't know
you were out here.

261
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,594
l wasn't.

262
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,680
How is Lenny?

263
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,394
Oh, dude, or what about
Your Grandma's Pussy?

264
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,354
lt's like Anaconda,
with seven cards down.

265
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,898
l'm fair to middling.
You know.

266
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:53,859
Leonard Maltin would give me
two-and-a-half stars.

267
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,862
l haven't seen you since,
probably, like 1 0 years ago.

268
00:19:56,946 --> 00:20:00,031
ln his movie guide.
Yeah, l think it was
actually Matt Levy's wedding.

269
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,075
l'm all shits
and giggles today.

270
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,704
Yeah. l think you'll find
l'm pretty much all shits.

271
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,582
lt's sad about Matt Levy.
Yeah.

272
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,292
Wait, what happened?

273
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,793
Oh, you didn't hear.

274
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,212
He died.

275
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,215
- Texas Hold 'em is dead.
- lt's dead.

276
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,885
You know,
that shit just
makes your lips drier.

277
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,261
l know.

278
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:25,515
There's Beth.

279
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,895
She and Steven
are getting a divorce.

280
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,313
They were
a cool couple.

281
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,814
Are any of those yours?

282
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:36,610
Yes, mine are the one
in the bumblebee costume

283
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,070
and the one in
the devil costume.

284
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:41,114
l think that's The Flash.

285
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,741
All the men out here
dress like children,

286
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,701
and the kids dress
like superheroes.

287
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,745
Hi, Dad.
Hey, sweet pea.

288
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,458
Come to think of it,
Steven's kind of a less
Jewish-looking version of you.

289
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,044
Less? l'm not even. . .
l'm only half.

290
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,129
Yeah,
but you're doing this.

291
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,505
What's. . .

292
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,175
l'm thinking small.

293
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,426
ls this a Jewish gesture?

294
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,844
l don't know.

295
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,305
Beller,
always with the self-hatred.

296
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,557
You're sweating.
l am. Yeah.

297
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,434
Have you been to
one of Eric's seders?

298
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,686
Eric gave trees to lsrael.

299
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,521
Am l not allowed
to joke about it?

300
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,815
No, l know. l'm just
saying, since you said
"less Jewish-looking,"

301
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,400
because most people
think l look ltalian.

302
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:18,902
And since my mom was
actually Protestant,

303
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,154
l'm not actually
Jewish at all, so. . .

304
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,034
Good to see you.

305
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,328
What are you
doing these days?

306
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,038
You're in New York, right?
Yeah.

307
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,331
Making music?

308
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,124
Haven't played
music in years.

309
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,126
l'm a carpenter,
you know, for money.

310
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:39,339
But right now,
l'm really trying
to do nothing for a while.

311
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,050
That's brave at our age.

312
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,888
l'm here for a few weeks
at my brother's,

313
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,100
and wanna have
a drink or something?

314
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,184
Um. . .

315
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,603
Sure. Okay.

316
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,259
"Dear Starbucks,

317
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,554
"in your attempt to
manufacture culture
out of fast-food coffee,

318
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,682
"you've been
surprisingly successful,
for the most part.

319
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:34,310
"The part that
isn't covered by
'the most part' sucks."

320
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,225
Hello?

321
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,103
Florence, hey,
it's Roger Greenberg.

322
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,646
Hi.

323
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:20,398
Sorry, l'm eating.

324
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:21,900
That's okay.

325
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,946
You wanna have
a drink or something?

326
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,031
Um...

327
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,866
Sure. Okay.

328
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:30,992
Um. . .

329
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,954
ls there a bar you
know we can go to?

330
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:38,666
There's one
near my apartment,
but it's pretty lame.

331
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,001
Okay.

332
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:43,588
lt's in Culver City.
Do you want to
meet me there?

333
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,006
l don't drive.

334
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,303
Those are all
kind of cheesy.

335
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,347
You have the light.
Oh.

336
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,482
Oh.

337
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,068
Oh. . .

338
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,656
Do you mind if we
stop by my house?
l left my purse. Sorry.

339
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,700
Do you need it?

340
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,619
l still get carded.

341
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,668
l don't read enough.

342
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,837
l'm such a bad reader.

343
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,589
ls that you?

344
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,341
Yeah, it's one
of the rare times

345
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,468
l was actually
happy around my dad.

346
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:34,973
Did you do that?

347
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,766
No, that's my niece.

348
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:38,268
lt's good.

349
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,061
She's four.

350
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,147
l want to have
a relationship with her,

351
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,524
she's just not
that friendly with me.

352
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:49,237
You want to see?
l got her these
puppets for her birthday.

353
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:54,075
They might be too old.
They have sticks.

354
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,453
Yeah. l'm sure
they'll be fine.

355
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,039
What do you have to drink?

356
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,207
Um. . .

357
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:02,709
Oh.

358
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,879
Okay, you don't
want to go to the bar?

359
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,338
lt's Friday.
The bars are probably

360
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,215
full of bridge
and tunnel people.

361
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:11,593
Or whatever the LA version
of bridge and tunnel is.

362
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:12,969
Sorry.

363
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,350
l don't really have. . .

364
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:25,273
There's a Corona Light
and some cheap tequila
someone left here once.

365
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,319
Shall we split
the Corona?

366
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:30,570
Okay.

367
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,599
l get the hiccups
when l first
drink carbonation.

368
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,559
Don't worry about it.

369
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:31,089
l'm wearing kind
of an ugly bra.

370
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,342
lt's like an ACE bandage.
There's no clasp.

371
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,824
Do you hear a train?

372
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,535
ls that a train?

373
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,498
l get kind of nerdy.

374
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,877
Don't worry about it.

375
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,092
Can we take it slow?

376
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,136
l'm sorry,
it's just that. . .

377
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,013
l just got out of
a long relationship,

378
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:22,307
and l don't want to
go from just having sex

379
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,600
to just having sex
to just having sex.

380
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:28,771
Who's the third
"just having sex"?

381
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:31,858
You, if we had sex.

382
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,820
Okay,
then who's the second?

383
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,448
A guy l met at
this gallery thing.

384
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:42,493
You slept with him?

385
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,579
Yeah, l did.

386
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,248
How did that go?

387
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,043
What do you mean?
The sex?

388
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,586
Yeah. Well. . .

389
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,256
lt was pretty awkward.

390
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:08,644
What is that
on your lip?

391
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:09,771
What?

392
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,440
ls that a. . .
Nothing.

393
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,026
No, it's not a cold sore.
You sure?

394
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,778
Yeah, l picked it.

395
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,822
Where's your bathroom?

396
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:45,598
This is so annoying,
but l have to call
my friend, Gina, back.

397
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:49,394
Sorry, it's just,
if l don't call her back,
then l'll be a bad friend.

398
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,979
She's always
got an emergency.
l'm sure it's nothing.

399
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,190
Uh, how far do you think
it would be to walk?

400
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,567
To your brother's?

401
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:59,612
Way too long,
like five miles.
You can stay here.

402
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,614
l have the dog and. . .

403
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,368
l can drive you.
This will only take a second.

404
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,870
You have to call
her right this moment?

405
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:10,790
Won't she understand
you're in the middle of a. . .

406
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,709
No, no.
l'll take you now. Sorry.

407
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,003
You know, l. . .
You don't have to do that.
You've got your robe. . .

408
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,630
Oh, no.
lt's not a problem.

409
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,090
l can probably call a cab.

410
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,341
Okay.

411
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,345
This is stupid.

412
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:28,683
l'm singing this Saturday
at this place on
Orange and Sunset.

413
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:32,687
l mean, if you feel like it.
l know it's last minute.

414
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,773
Oh, my friend Gina
made the flyers

415
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,817
and she wrote down
the address wrong.

416
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:40,278
l don't think. . .
What time?

417
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:41,529
Like 11:30.

418
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,157
There's a lot of acts,
so it's kind of
hard to pinpoint.

419
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,159
Don't feel obligated.

420
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:49,370
We probably shouldn't
do this again.

421
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:52,206
l mean,
you work for my brother.
Yeah.

422
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,417
And l'm really trying to
do nothing right now.

423
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,710
That's cool.

424
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,963
And l've got to
stop doing things
just 'cause they feel good.

425
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,925
A mental patient
just went down on you.

426
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,053
Why do you
say it like that?
He's not crazy.

427
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,388
Mmm-hmm.

428
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,725
A lot of people go
to insane asylums.

429
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,976
A lot of people
are in therapy,

430
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,769
they're not in
insane asylums.

431
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,439
He's also 40.

432
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,191
Jesus.

433
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,778
He seems vulnerable.

434
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,576
l'm awake now.

435
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:35,583
- That could happen.
- What?

436
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:39,962
lt'd have to be
a super high-end
fucking garbage disposal.

437
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,215
You can't hold any
revelations l had

438
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:45,593
during a shamanic
ceremony against me.

439
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,471
There.
You're judging me.
That guy's there.

440
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:49,931
Oh, hey, what's up, man?

441
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,182
Hey.

442
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,976
Why am l still pissed off?
We were 25.

443
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,645
We finally got a break,
and you had to fuck it up.

444
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:56,771
l didn't like the deal.

445
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:00,650
lt was completely standard.
lt was a record deal,
Roger, okay?

446
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,360
lt was a very big
thing for us and

447
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:03,986
we were not gonna get
any better than that.

448
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,446
lt was corporate bullshit.

449
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,907
l didn't want
to be a slave to the
A and R department.

450
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,034
They'd fuck with the songs.
We had no control.

451
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,286
You were not the only person
in the band, Roger.

452
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,288
Do you understand that?

453
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,999
lt's morally reprehensible
what you did.

454
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:19,752
l'm sorry,
but l didn't want to do it
unless it was on our terms.

455
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,045
Well, you got your way,
you know.

456
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,672
There's no record.
There's no band.

457
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,340
There's your terms. Awesome.

458
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,050
Beller,
it was 1 5 years ago.

459
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,303
You're rich.
What do you care?
You've done all right.

460
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,222
lt doesn't matter.
No, it does matter.

461
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,349
You're not the person
who l thought you were.

462
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,601
What about lvan?
He's fixing computers now.

463
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:36,978
This could have
changed his life.

464
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,689
lvan was counting on it.
He co-wrote those
songs with you, man.

465
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,023
lvan wrote some of
the music with me.

466
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:42,858
Stop rationalizing.

467
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,695
lvan can take
care of himself.

468
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,030
l'm surprised
he still speaks to you.

469
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,574
You know,
why am l even here?

470
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,742
You're never gonna change.

471
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:55,413
What's that?
What's that sigh?

472
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:58,958
Nothing.

473
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:12,054
What are you doing?
Asshole.

474
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,909
Hey.

475
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:20,373
Go get it.

476
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,758
What the fuck?

477
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,402
Hello?
Florence,
it's Roger Greenberg.

478
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:50,736
Hey.
Um. . .

479
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,657
Mahler's. . .
He's breathing weird,

480
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,701
and he's suddenly
lethargic and. . .

481
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,369
Sometimes
he gets overheated.

482
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,371
No, l mean,
he hasn't moved, period.

483
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,748
And l can't get
through to fucking Vietnam,

484
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:05,459
and l'm sorry to
have to call you.

485
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,087
l just. . .
l don't know if you know. . .

486
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,263
How long do we wait?

487
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,099
l don't know.
They seem kind of busy.

488
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,853
Should l go ask?

489
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:27,606
lf you want.

490
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,609
Do you wanna do it?

491
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,195
Oh.

492
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:34,822
Okay.

493
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,077
They know we're here,
but. . .

494
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:44,749
Hi.

495
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,834
Do you know
how much longer
for Mahler?

496
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,169
You know,
l think we're just waiting

497
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,462
for a doctor to
get out of the room.

498
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:50,838
Okay.

499
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,512
She thinks that
they're just waiting

500
00:34:58,597 --> 00:34:59,972
for a doctor to
get out of the room.

501
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,141
Yeah, l could hear her.
Okay.

502
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,812
l think
it's sciatica.

503
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,814
Yeah,
he's had that before.

504
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:12,318
But his eyes are jaundiced,
so l'd like to run some tests

505
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:16,113
and l will keep him overnight
just to make sure
everything is okay.

506
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:18,407
And l imagine
you can bring
him home tomorrow.

507
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:19,784
Thank you.
lt's okay.

508
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,707
They gave him
an infusion?

509
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,793
ls it his white blood cells
or his red blood cells?

510
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:30,419
l'm pretty sure white.

511
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:33,923
Well, it makes a difference.
Are you taking notes?

512
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:35,090
l haven't yet, no.

513
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,759
You have to
write this stuff down

514
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,010
if you're not
gonna remember it.

515
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:41,096
l'm sorry. l'm almost
positive it's white.

516
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,098
Did you ask him
about the dog house?

517
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:44,475
When's he
coming home?

518
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,643
He was supposed
to come home today,

519
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:49,480
but the numbers dropped
and they wanna keep
him until he's stable.

520
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,524
But they asked
if the gardeners
use rat poison.

521
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:52,817
They're not supposed to.

522
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,735
Shit! Should we be
getting on a plane?

523
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,487
No. No, he'll be okay.

524
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,989
l mean,
l'll let you know if. . .
Fuck.

525
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,449
Mahler.

526
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:01,826
Has he started
the dog house?

527
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,577
l'll call Florence
and get the information.

528
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:06,539
l'm doing it, okay?
So you can call me.
'Cause l pretty much got it.

529
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,290
Pretty much
isn't very comforting
to Carol and me.

530
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,459
Yeah, well,
he's not my dog, okay?

531
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,878
l'm trying to
take care of it.

532
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,925
Listen, l'm sorry. l. . .

533
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,094
l know when Mom was sick,
l know you said

534
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,679
l needed to come out,
but Mom said l didn't.

535
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,055
Listen, we've done that.
Mom's dead.

536
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,348
l'm not gonna
baby you about it.

537
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,393
l'm talking about right now.
l'm in Vietnam
and my dog is sick.

538
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,395
And you know what?
Carol warned me.

539
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,272
This is so
fucking typical of you.

540
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:33,691
l'm sorry to get so heated.

541
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,861
l know you're trying.
lt's scary being so far away.

542
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,946
Yeah, well,
you can trust me, okay?

543
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,073
l know.

544
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,159
How...

545
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,204
How are you doing?
Huh, man?

546
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:48,289
l'm fine.

547
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:49,999
Fine.

548
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:51,750
Good.
What's going on?

549
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:55,921
Carol wants me to
ask about the dog house,
if that even matters now.

550
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:58,966
Can the pool overflow?

551
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,552
Yes, the pool can
fucking overflow!

552
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,304
What the fuck's
going on over there?

553
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,222
lt's raining.
"Have a great vacation."

554
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:06,682
"Thank you.
Take care of my
house and dog."

555
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:07,975
"Oh, is he dead? Sorry."

556
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,226
You know what?
l asked you a question.

557
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:11,520
"Can the pool overflow?"
Fuck you!

558
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,443
Hello?

559
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:24,969
There's a rugged
road on the prairie

560
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:29,306
Stretchin' all across
the last frontier

561
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:36,063
There a stranger strives
solitary

562
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:41,402
Blessed is the
lonesome pioneer

563
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:46,407
Roll on, roll on, roll on

564
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,826
Night birds are flyin'

565
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,454
Come on, the light is gone

566
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,665
Hope's slowly dyin'

567
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:59,169
Tell me how you come
ridin' through

568
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,673
Can l get four beers?

569
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:08,178
Are you Roger?
Uh-huh.

570
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,263
l'm Gina,

571
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,682
Florence's friend.
Uh-huh.

572
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,601
l've heard
a lot about you.

573
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,104
Do you wanna
come join our table?

574
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,943
No, l think l'll stay here.
Maybe later.

575
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:26,447
lsn't she beautiful?

576
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,951
She's so ultra-sexy
and hot up there.

577
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:33,829
What's that look?

578
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,874
You're so quiet.

579
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,420
l'm thinking of
a letter l'm gonna write.

580
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,965
l hear you don't drive.
Uh-huh.

581
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:48,010
Did you ever drive?
Mmm-hmm.

582
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,179
l grew up here,
l drove then.

583
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,639
l moved to New York
and l stopped.

584
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,227
lt was really
nice meeting you.

585
00:39:57,312 --> 00:40:01,732
Gainin' steady
till this round is won

586
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:06,195
On the long and lonely road
to kingdom come

587
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:13,035
People far below
chasin' pleasures

588
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:17,706
Offer him directions
on the run

589
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:24,338
Prophets on the path
offer treasures

590
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:29,384
And though he's mighty hungry
he takes none

591
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:34,973
Roll on, roll on, roll on

592
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,226
Night birds are flyin'

593
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,896
Come on, the light is gone

594
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,856
Hope's slowly dyin'

595
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,217
People don't call on
my birthday anymore.

596
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:14,096
l guess l don't call
people on their birthdays,
so why should they call me?

597
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,932
l didn't call you.
When's yours?

598
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,016
November.

599
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,352
That's right.
l'll call you this year.

600
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,900
We're taking
her to this side.

601
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:31,155
Laughing already
demonstrates appreciation,

602
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,906
the applause
seems superfluous.

603
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,119
And also, it's like,
just treat the restaurant

604
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,288
like it's your
living room, guy.

605
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,833
l'm weirdly on tonight.

606
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,209
Should we order?

607
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:46,712
Maybe l should've
invited Florence.

608
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,423
Or l should've had a party.

609
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:51,800
Birthdays are hard, man.

610
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,094
lt's weird aging, right?

611
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:57,389
lt's like, "What the fuck
is going on?"
l know.

612
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,183
Youth is wasted
on the young.

613
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,185
l'd go further.
l'd go,

614
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,811
"Life is wasted on

615
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,022
"people."

616
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:08,317
Should l invite her?

617
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:09,693
lt doesn't have
to mean anything.

618
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,279
l don't wanna set up
a series of expectations
with her.

619
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,490
What do you think?

620
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:16,825
Yeah, if you want.

621
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,702
l guess l could call her.

622
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,662
Okay, then we should
wait to order.

623
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,206
Maybe it'd be good.
Do you care?

624
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,415
No, no.
lt's a different dynamic.

625
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,667
Yeah.
She lives near here.
l'll see if she's around.

626
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:28,045
She probably has
other plans.

627
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,380
l won't get into it
being my birthday.

628
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,465
She's young.

629
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:47,481
Thank you.

630
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,069
Thanks.

631
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,116
l don't find a lot of
girls in LA attractive.

632
00:42:58,201 --> 00:42:59,534
Do you?
l do, yeah.

633
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,203
l said l don't.

634
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,287
Oh, l do.

635
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:04,122
She isn't as pretty as Beth,

636
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,667
or her face is,
but she's bigger.

637
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:08,377
Not fat.

638
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:11,755
l find it sexy,
but you'll see.

639
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,800
l never found
Beth as beautiful
as everyone else did.

640
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:16,718
She was my girlfriend.

641
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:17,928
Years ago.

642
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,680
l didn't think
you'd take offense.

643
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,473
Well, you like
racist Portuguese women.

644
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,809
She made one remark,
and it's a cultural thing.

645
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:26,103
l mean, by our standards,
Fabula's mother is a bigot.

646
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,691
l know you
never liked Fabula.
Florence is. . .

647
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,025
lf you worked in
an office with her,

648
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,694
you'd definitely
develop a crush on her,

649
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,862
but outside the office,

650
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,698
you'd start to wonder
if she was as cute
as you'd imagined.

651
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,408
l'm just saying,
you know, Fabula is

652
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:41,451
a lot less possessive
than she used to be.

653
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:42,703
You'd like her more now.

654
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,080
Can l get another Scotch?

655
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,540
That's the busboy.

656
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,001
Fine, can l get another fork?
This one has some food on it.

657
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,795
Fabula never got you.

658
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,755
She thought she'd bagged
some fancy British guy

659
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,465
rather than just lvan.

660
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,134
l know she helped you
with the addiction
and everything,

661
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:58,802
but you're over that now.

662
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,470
We have to find you someone.

663
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,349
lt's too bad neither of us
are the type to go whoring.

664
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:05,434
ls that her?

665
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,232
Hi.
Hi.

666
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:15,277
This is lvan.

667
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,695
Hello.
lt's nice to meet you.

668
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,572
Hi. Hello.
Hi.

669
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,242
Sorry.
Sorry.

670
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,203
l'll be right back.

671
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,584
Hello?
Beth.

672
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,003
What?

673
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:34,421
Beth?

674
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:35,714
Who?

675
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:38,717
ls this a child?

676
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:40,594
Yes.

677
00:44:41,054 --> 00:44:42,346
ls your mom there?

678
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,431
Who is this?

679
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,682
Roger.

680
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:46,767
Miller?

681
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,685
Roger.

682
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,520
Mom, it's Miller!

683
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:54,900
Hello?
Beth.

684
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,735
Who's this?

685
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,028
Roger.

686
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,196
Oh, hi.

687
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:01,323
What are you doing?

688
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,868
l'm sewing Charles' pants.

689
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,578
Uh-huh.
ls Charles your son?

690
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,914
Yeah. Hot stuff.

691
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,042
Are you sewing
his Flash suit?

692
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,294
ls he the devil
or the Flash? Did he say?

693
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:16,797
Yeah.

694
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:20,217
How's the rest of
your week looking?

695
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,055
What'd you do with her?
She's in the bathroom.

696
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:29,351
You see what l mean
about working in an office?

697
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,435
Where'd you go?

698
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,561
l called Beth.

699
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:33,980
Really?
Come on, l mean,
Beth is a part of my life.

700
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:35,065
She's. . .

701
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:40,070
l don't believe
that things happen
for a reason, but maybe

702
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,406
me being out here at
this particular time,

703
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,743
it's happening for a reason.

704
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:52,958
l cannot believe
you still have this.

705
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:55,210
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
And l got you this.

706
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,131
Wow.
"The Magic Marker. Live!"
Man, look at Beller.

707
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:01,508
How is Lenny?

708
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,635
Lenny not so good.

709
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,138
You've got a bit of
a mullet going on there.

710
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:07,681
No, l think
that's a shadow.

711
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:10,267
You're trying so
hard to look casual.

712
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,602
Happy birthday
to you

713
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:14,896
No, don't have them
do that. Don't.

714
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:16,940
Happy birthday to you

715
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,108
Don't.

716
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,609
You're such
a fucking asshole.

717
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:20,694
Roger, relax.

718
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,904
You know l hate this shit.
Will you stop? No. . .

719
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:26,450
Okay?

720
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,201
Sit on my dick, asshole!

721
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:34,791
And many more.

722
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,628
What the fuck, right?

723
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:41,131
Well, he just got out
of a mental hospital.
Right.

724
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,176
What? Really?

725
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:46,970
l mean, who does that?
Gets the waiters.

726
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,223
l'm not one of these
preening LA people

727
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,058
who likes everything
to be about them.

728
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,812
l'm not some dickhead
who does karaoke
at the Farmers Market

729
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:59,274
and hosts
a running charades game
every Friday night,

730
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,484
and swing dances.

731
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:02,777
What?

732
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:05,822
You told lvan to
sit on your dick.

733
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:08,658
Did l?
Yeah.

734
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,329
What the hell
does that mean?

735
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:13,580
l don't know.

736
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:18,919
Okay.

737
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:20,921
Now,

738
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,089
happy birthday.

739
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:30,680
Great.

740
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:31,890
So, l got the witch.

741
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:33,850
Thanks.

742
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:35,393
l made a snap judgment.

743
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:37,979
lf you'd rather the devil,
you can switch it out.

744
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:39,397
No, l'm happy
with the witch.

745
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,526
You're right,
these are too
old for your niece.

746
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:47,697
l'm impressed by you.

747
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:49,950
ln what way?

748
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:51,159
l don't know.

749
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:53,537
l mean, you seem
really fine doing nothing.

750
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:57,958
lt's like you don't
feel all that bullshit
pressure to be successful.

751
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,128
l mean,
by other people's standards.

752
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:04,047
l'm. . .

753
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:07,926
You know,
l almost had a record deal
when l got out of college.

754
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,469
l haven't done nothing.

755
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:11,137
Cool.

756
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:12,931
l want to be
doing nothing.

757
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,599
l'm doing
nothing deliberately.

758
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:16,059
That's what l'm saying.

759
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,520
l don't know that
l could do nothing

760
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,313
and be that cool
with everything.

761
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,858
Well, there's so
much crap out there.

762
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,529
Mahler's not at home.

763
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,866
You could stay over.

764
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:33,827
Wink-wink.

765
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:36,830
Um. . .

766
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:38,915
l'm not supposed to. . .

767
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:41,376
l try not to. . .

768
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,006
But, fuck it.
Yeah, okay.

769
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:55,807
lvan's nice.

770
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:59,686
ls he your best friend?

771
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,063
Yeah, l guess so.

772
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,484
l lost lvan
there for a few years

773
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:09,613
to this racist
he met in rehab.

774
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:13,950
But their marriage is ending,
which is good for him,

775
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:17,078
and me, to be honest.

776
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:18,121
Good.

777
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,247
You probably
wouldn't believe this,

778
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:20,874
but in college we
all looked up to him.

779
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,335
He was from England

780
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:26,296
and he used to be
really handsome and stylish

781
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,465
and kind of great.
l can believe that.

782
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:30,884
lvan and l
call each other "man,"
but it's meant as a joke.

783
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,720
lt's the kind of thing
we wouldn't say, 'cause. . .

784
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,263
lt's our imitation
of other people.

785
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:37,974
l know what that's like.

786
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:40,060
This friend of mine,
Marnie, and me,

787
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,020
we went. . .

788
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:48,777
We went to this
cheesy bar in Hollywood

789
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,821
and we just thought,

790
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,865
"Let's pretend to
be these slutty girls

791
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,408
who are looking
to get picked up,

792
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:56,910
"even though we're not."

793
00:49:57,745 --> 00:50:00,955
And we end up
talking to these
two frat guys,

794
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,749
but, like, 30.

795
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,752
And they were all
into their bodies

796
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,880
and cologned,
very well-groomed.

797
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:14,094
And we ended up going back
to one of their places.

798
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:19,391
And l think
one of them was, like,
almost retarded,

799
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:22,018
or else he was really drunk,

800
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:23,436
because he
didn't make any sense.

801
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,773
And they got out
this video camera

802
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:31,236
and Marnie and l,
we did this
kind of striptease.

803
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,863
And it was crazy

804
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:37,409
because we were still
playing these girls,

805
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:40,912
but there we were,
showing our breasts. . .

806
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,375
And then,

807
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,795
we ran out of
there pretty fast.
We were total freaks.

808
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:59,222
You never have
anything good to drink.

809
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,478
You know, that's like
the stupidest story
l've ever heard.

810
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,647
lt's just. . .

811
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,315
Bye.

812
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,943
What?
What is
the point of that story?

813
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:30,336
Lots of really
great, interesting people

814
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:31,963
have tried to
kill themselves.

815
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,214
He tried to
kill himself?

816
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:35,967
l don't think so.
l'm just saying.

817
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,969
Come on,
he's an asshole.

818
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,345
That's a defense.

819
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,639
He's not like us.
He's. . .

820
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:45,602
You can tell that
a lot of normal stuff
is really hard for him.

821
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:46,978
Like being nice?

822
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,313
l like him.

823
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:50,273
Should l call him?
No!

824
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,441
l don't like
how he treats you.

825
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,817
He acts like
you work for him.

826
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:54,360
Well, l work
for his brother.

827
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:56,321
l don't wanna be rude.

828
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:59,699
lf you keep
driving him places,
l'll stop speaking to you.

829
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:02,327
Okay.

830
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:06,206
We think it's
an autoimmune disorder.
Uh-huh.

831
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:11,127
This hospital,
it has more experience
with internal medicine.

832
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:13,755
l called,
and they're expecting you.

833
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,590
You can't do it here?

834
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,634
l mean, you know him now.

835
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:20,053
l know,
but he needs to get well.

836
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,222
Thank you.
Come on, Mahler.
l know the doctors there.

837
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:23,807
You'll be in good hands.

838
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:25,892
This is where we're going.

839
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,977
l got to pick Victor
up from school
in half an hour.

840
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:29,312
Can you ask Florence?

841
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:32,649
l'm trying
not to call her.

842
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:34,317
l'm just going to
hurt her feelings, man.

843
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,486
l'm trying not to do
that to people anymore.

844
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,322
And l don't want
to be asking anyone
for a ride anymore, ever.

845
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,368
l just turned 41 ,
l should be able to drive.

846
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:44,786
Why are you yelling at me?

847
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,038
What a pain in the ass.

848
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,248
Come on, come on.

849
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:55,004
Survival rate
is about 50-50,

850
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:57,173
but hopefully with
the right cocktail of drugs,

851
00:52:57,258 --> 00:53:00,260
we'll be able to
get it under control
and keep him stable.

852
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,428
"Dear
Hollywood Pet Taxi,

853
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,180
"you would think
a vehicle made expressly

854
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:06,015

of animals

855
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,684
"would have a soft floor.

00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:28,246
"l intend to copy the ASPCA.

865
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,039
"Sincerely, Roger Greenberg."

866
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,718
l always felt bad
about that night

867
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:43,636
after we played
the Viper Room,

868
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:45,638
and you were there
with your sister,

869
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,265
and l wanted to
go to that party

870
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,559
and you were tired
and l let you go home.

871
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,643
What night was that?

872
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,103
You were with your sister.

873
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:55,231
Yeah, l don't. . .
l don't remember that night.

874
00:53:55,316 --> 00:53:56,524
l should have been
straight with you 'cause

875
00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:58,985
l originally got into
music to meet girls,

876
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,945
and l think when we
were playing around LA

877
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,280
and l was starting to
get some attention. . .

878
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,823
From girls, yeah.
No, l understand.

879
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:06,200
Yeah, but l wasn't
clear with you

880
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:08,494
and l want to apologize
for how l behaved,

881
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,164
'cause l kind
of just let it end,

882
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,750
and left town and
was uncommunicative.
Yeah.

883
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,251
And l feel like
l didn't even
give you a reason. . .

884
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:17,378
Yeah, but, you know,
l knew.

885
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:19,923
Well, l'm sorry.

886
00:54:20,049 --> 00:54:21,090
lt's okay.

887
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:24,469
Like l said, l don't
even remember that night.

888
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:27,388
You had bought
a new mattress
that afternoon.

889
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,642
Sounds plausible.

890
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:32,810
l mean, what was it, like,
1 5 years ago or something?

891
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:36,356
Yeah,
you didn't like the Sealy,
you thought it was too mushy.

892
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,944
We used to make that
1 -800-Mattress joke,

893
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,528
"The extra 'S'
for extra sex."

894
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:45,198
Okay. Okay.

895
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,660
We could've gotten
married and had kids.

896
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:50,411
Yeah? Do you think?

897
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:53,122
l don't think we would've.
Really.

898
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,209
l don't know,
it was a big
relationship for me.

899
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,301
So, you're a carpenter now?

900
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:08,471
Yeah. l was always
good at making things,
so. . .

901
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:09,555
Oh, yeah?

902
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,933
Beth,

903
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:14,102
l made you that bed.
Don't you remember?

904
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:17,063
lt was why
we were going to buy
the mattress to begin with.

905
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:22,193
Yes, l do.
l do. l do remember that.
l'm sorry. Totally.

906
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,278
Go on.

907
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:26,489
l work out of
a studio in Bushwick

908
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,616
that l share with
a few other carpenters
and that's

909
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,160
been pretty good.

910
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:32,578
lt's political, though.

911
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:33,663
Um. . .

912
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,665
What else?

913
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,251
Recently,
l had this thing

914
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:40,795
where l
couldn't move my legs,

915
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:42,672
literally.

916
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,257
You know,
but it was psychological.

917
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:46,676
God. . .

918
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,845
Yeah, so that took
some time dealing with.

919
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:51,931
l think that
brings us up to date.

920
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,935
Are you okay?

921
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:57,603
Yeah.

922
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,774
l just. . .
l think l need to
just let go, you know?

923
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,527
l had a shrink
there who said,

924
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:07,196
"You only miss by 5%."

925
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:09,449
l'm not positive
what it means,

926
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,909
but in most things,
95 is pretty good.

927
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:15,538
l had a shrink
once who told me,

928
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:20,043
"You're of value."

929
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:23,463
lt's stupid,
but it always stayed with me.

930
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:27,091
You look really pretty.

931
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,010
Thanks.

932
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:32,388
My dog is sick.

933
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:33,473
Oh, yeah?

934
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:35,892
My mom is sick.

935
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:37,977
Phillip's dog, really,
but l'm taking care of him.

936
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:40,354
He has
an autoimmune disorder.

937
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,940
Since he got sick,
l keep thinking
l have something.

938
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:47,945
l'm sorry about your mom.

939
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,113
Yeah.

940
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,826
l'm glad you're
feeling better.

941
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,996
l get horrible
anxiety sometimes, still.

942
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:58,998
Yeah, that l remember.

943
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:03,795
Do you want to
have dinner one night?

944
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,881
This week?
Or next.
l kind of meant. . .

945
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,217
Like, on a date.

946
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:10,468
Oh.

947
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:13,429
No.

948
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:15,807
l mean, you know,
that's just a terrible idea.

949
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:17,350
No. l mean, you know, no.

950
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:21,187
Hello.

951
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,189
Shit, they just. . .
They don't even. . .

952
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:24,607
She doesn't seem to. . .

953
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,442
She looks harried
even though no one's here.

954
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:28,861
l'm just going to
go get her.

955
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,154
l'm sure she'll be by.

956
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,160
Hi. Could you send our bill?

957
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:48,256
What is going on? Okay.

958
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,966
Water. Water.

959
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,594
Oh, God.

960
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:54,679
Hello.

961
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,472
How is Lenny?

962
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:58,182
Lenny not so good.

963
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,311
Not too late to call,
l hope.

964
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:03,396
No.

965
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,984
Watching Just My Luck
with Lindsay Lohan
on Starz.

966
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,236
Mmm. How is it?

967
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:11,821
Kind of funny.

968
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:13,614
She's got charm.

969
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:15,783
All right.

970
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,328
So, l was thinking

971
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,040
we should maybe
do something together again.

972
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:26,252
Write some songs.

973
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:28,462
Aren't you going
back to New York?

974
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:30,548
Yeah, but...

975
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:34,302
lf we got something going
l could stay here, possibly.

976
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:36,345
l don't know if
l've really got time,
you know,

977
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:39,432
with the computer
work and Victor.

978
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,516
Uh-huh.

979
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:42,852
lsn't it funny, don't you
still think of yourself
as a guitar player

980
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,729
even though you
don't do it anymore?

981
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:46,898
No. No. No, l don't.

982
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,234
You know,
l've just hired this guy

983
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:52,945
called Ezra to help
with the company, so. . .

984
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:57,325
lt's just, you know,
l've got to
concentrate on that.

985
00:58:58,410 --> 00:58:59,660
Okay.

986
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,289
l think l'm having
a party tomorrow.

987
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:04,957
Tomorrow?

988
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,084
A pool party. So, come.

989
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:08,377
Bring Victor.

990
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:09,629
Pool party? Cool.

991
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:12,423
After we hang up,
l'm going to
call some people.

992
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,301
Okay, man. Listen,
l'll see you tomorrow.

993
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:17,428
All right. Bye.

994
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,150
Do you want to
see a Bigfoot walk?

995
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:17,029
Very famous footage
of him doing this.
He doesn't wear no shoes.

996
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,240
Bigfoot.

997
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:22,493
And there's lots of
scientific evidence,
my friend.

998
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:29,000
Megan's husband
wants to know,

999
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:32,378
do you know what kind of tree
that skinny one with
the yellow flowers is?

1000
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,462
No.

1001
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:36,048
l mean, l wouldn't
even think to know
something like that.

1002
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:38,259
Are you coming out?
Victor wants to
show you his dive.

1003
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,553
ls it okay? ls it a dud?

1004
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,346
l do this,
l throw a party last minute,

1005
01:00:42,431 --> 01:00:44,098
then l'm disappointed
that no one can come.

1006
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,142
lt's fine.
We're having fun.

1007
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:47,476
l need to put
together the chips

1008
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:51,063
and guac and
Creamsicles l bought.

1009
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:54,025
l got you iced tea
and lemonade,

1010
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:56,277
but l didn't know
the right proportions,
so you'll have to make it.

1011
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,403
l see. Thanks.

1012
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,949
l guess l'll
make an appearance.

1013
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:05,536
Are you pulling a Gatsby
and watching the party
from afar?

1014
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,788
l don't know that
l need to document

1015
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:09,749
the reasons how this
isn't like a Gatsby.

1016
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:12,835
Marlon and Peggy
are really nice.

1017
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,712
l didn't even invite them,
they just come here.

1018
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:17,089
lt turns out they've got
a son who went to the
same school as Victor.

1019
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,674
lt's such a small world.

1020
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:20,009
Why is that
news to you?

1021
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:21,260
lt is a small world.

1022
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:23,888
l'm surprised we all
don't run into each
other more often.

1023
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:25,639
You and l went to
school together.

1024
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,530
Hey.
Hey, Rog.

1025
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:50,706
Hi, this is Florence.

1026
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:53,167
l'm sorry to be calling,
but l wanted to
check and see how...

1027
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:54,210
Hello?

1028
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:56,796
Oh, l wanted to check
and see how Mahler is.

1029
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,506
We had to move him
to another vet.

1030
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:00,007
Really?

1031
01:02:00,092 --> 01:02:02,927
Yeah, they do better
with internal medicine there.

1032
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:03,969
l was going to
call you, but. . .

1033
01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:06,305
ls he okay?
What did they say?

1034
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:07,807
l thought it was sciatica.

1035
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:09,475
Can you. . .

1036
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,311
Please.

1037
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:16,065
l'd like to see
him at the hospital,

1038
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,483
if you can give
me the information.

1039
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,237
We don't have to
see each other.
We can go at different times.

1040
01:02:26,118 --> 01:02:27,493
l like the old vet better.

1041
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:42,341
Gina told me it's
nice to leave them

1042
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:44,093
something that
smells like you.

1043
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:49,682
Sometimes l think
he's a human
in a dog costume.

1044
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:05,698
Wait.

1045
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:01,962
l don't know any of this.

1046
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,716
l don't know Karen Dalton.

1047
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,385
Very cool. Thanks.

1048
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:10,137
You sure you don't know it?
No. No.

1049
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,348
Thanks. Thank you.

1050
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:13,974
You can tell me
if you know it.

1051
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:15,434
l don't.

1052
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,103
Karen Dalton was,

1053
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:20,231
like, this homeless
junkie in the '70s.

1054
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:23,651
You know,
it's a woman with sandals.

1055
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:26,028
Maybe there's something
you can sing on there.

1056
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,698
You like old things.

1057
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:30,991
A shrink said to me once,

1058
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:33,410
l have trouble
living in the present,
so l linger on the past

1059
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:36,455
because l felt like
l never really lived it
in the first place, you know?

1060
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:40,376
Do you think
you could love me?

1061
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:44,880
l don't know, Florence.

1062
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:52,846
l just get excited
to see you, and then. . .

1063
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:57,685
l think l get worried
it's gonna go too fast,

1064
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:59,311
so l say things
to get a reaction.

1065
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,208
What?

1066
01:05:21,293 --> 01:05:23,002
We got to stop this.

1067
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:24,920
Really?
Yeah.

1068
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:26,589
You got to stop calling me.

1069
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:28,090
l've intentionally
not called you.

1070
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:31,260
Even when l needed
to call you, l didn't.
You know, l took a pet taxi.

1071
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:32,761
l haven't called you.

1072
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:34,263
You called me today.

1073
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:36,515
That was for Mahler.

1074
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,934
Come on,
it wasn't for Mahler.

1075
01:05:39,019 --> 01:05:40,894
Florence,
take some responsibility.

1076
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:42,771
Don't put yourself in
this kind of situation.

1077
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,399
What situation?
l like seeing you.

1078
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:47,318
No, you don't.
You don't like it.

1079
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:51,113
Why are we even
having this conversation?
We're not really even dating,

1080
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:53,532
and we're
seeing other people.

1081
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:54,617
l'm not seeing anyone.

1082
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:56,493
Neither am l,
but l want to.

1083
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,621
Who?
l don't know! Anyone.

1084
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:01,081
l'm doing nothing.
l'm not tied to anyone.

1085
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:03,667
How many times do we
have to go over it?
Jesus, l. . .

1086
01:06:03,752 --> 01:06:07,296
l should be with
a divorced 38-year-old
who has teenage kids

1087
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,548
and low expectations
about life.

1088
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,967
l don't want to
fucking do this anymore.

1089
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:13,135
God !

1090
01:07:36,928 --> 01:07:39,513
Half a pill three
times a day with food.

1091
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:42,641
The blood thinners,
just at night.
They're for the blood clots.

1092
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:45,227
And he'll get prednisone,
which is a steroid,

1093
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,312
twice a day for three days,

1094
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,273
and then we'll bring him down
to one-and-a-half a day

1095
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:50,774
and the blood
thinners every other day.

1096
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:52,735
Okay?

1097
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,281
Hi, little Mahler baby.

1098
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:00,492
Tried lvan,
but he had a birthday party.

1099
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,121
l didn't want to cram him
into a shitty pet taxi.

1100
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:05,247
Hi, baby.

1101
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:06,457
Thank you for doing this.

1102
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:07,666
l'm here for Mahler.

1103
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:12,045
Gina says l'm crazy
to drive you anywhere.

1104
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,255
Right.

1105
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:14,631
Your credit card.

1106
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:19,178
$3,084?

1107
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:28,145
He seems better.

1108
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:30,522
Give me his pills and
l'll mark them for you,
so you don't forget.

1109
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,946
Hi,
you've reached the Greenbergs,
please leave a message.

1110
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:40,616
lf you put
the pills in peanut butter,
they go down easier.

1111
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,367
Roger,
it's Phillip. Pick up.

1112
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:43,452
Pick up!

1113
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:46,872
Fuck it. l got
a very weird message
from Florence.

1114
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,874
She's thinking of quitting.

1115
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,292
What the fuck's
going on over there?

1116
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:53,128
Did you do something
that freaked her out?

1117
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:56,924
Do you know
how hard it is to find
an assistant l actually like?

1118
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:58,801
Jesus! l can't
trust you with anyone.

1119
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:00,803
How is Mahler?
How is Mahler, by the way?

1120
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:03,722
Did you pick him up today?
Call me.

1121
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:09,394
Are you cooking?
You wanna make Jell-O?

1122
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,980
The vet said
that the steroids
might upset his stomach.

1123
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:15,859
l'll just. . . l'll cook
this and then l'll go.

1124
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,366
Gonna make chicken, too?

1125
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:24,368
l can pick up a roast
chicken at the market.

1126
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:26,870
He shouldn't have the skin,
it's too rich.

1127
01:09:26,955 --> 01:09:28,705
l can eat the skin.

1128
01:09:29,541 --> 01:09:31,416
You wanna have
chicken and rice
with Mahler?

1129
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:34,837
You can walk to Ralphs,
it's three blocks from here.

1130
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:38,173
Okay, will you be
here when l get back?

1131
01:09:38,258 --> 01:09:39,883
Oh, my God.

1132
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:44,763
l'll go get the chicken,
but l'm going to call
you when l'm pulling up

1133
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:47,683
and l want you to come out
and l want you to get it
from me.

1134
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:57,818
Thank you.
Listen, l'm sorry about
my freak-out the other night.

1135
01:09:57,902 --> 01:09:59,695
You know?
l gotta try to not do that.

1136
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:02,114
l get abusive and
l'm working on that.

1137
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,699
So, anyway, l apologize.

1138
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:04,950
Thank you.

1139
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:09,162
l mean, it's not just me.

1140
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:11,206
You do participate
in it, too, though.
l mean, don't you think?

1141
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:14,042
No, then you're not
apologizing, you know.
l'm. . .

1142
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:16,253
This isn't a good day
for me. l'm gonna go.

1143
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:17,421
l'm apologizing
for my side of it.

1144
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:18,547
That's not an apology.

1145
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:19,882
Well, apologizing is hard.

1146
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:21,133
No, it's not.
Not for me.

1147
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,385
Well, it is for me.
You know what, Florence?
You know what l think?

1148
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:25,554
l think you're
transferring shit onto me.

1149
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:28,640
l think you're looking
to me for the mental
and physical abuse

1150
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:31,476
of your father,
and sexual molestation,
or whatever.

1151
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:32,728
l was not molested.

1152
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:35,439
Or whatever.
He was withholding.
l'm right about that, right?

1153
01:10:36,316 --> 01:10:38,150
l was not molested !

1154
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:39,735
l said "whatever."

1155
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:51,830
You have
reached the voicemail of Gina.

1156
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:55,500
Gina, call me back
when you get this, okay?

1157
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:58,337
Also, we have to be there
at 7:00 in the morning,

1158
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:01,006
so you should
pick me up at 6:30.

1159
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:22,069
Hands across the water

1160
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:27,115
Heads across the sky

1161
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:31,328
Admiral Halsey notified me

1162
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:32,996
He had to have a berth
or he couldn't get to sea

1163
01:11:39,379 --> 01:11:40,879
Hey.
Hey.

1164
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,882
l thought you were Gina.

1165
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:45,676
No, it's me.

1166
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,387
Roger.
This one's for me.

1167
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:49,596
What?

1168
01:11:49,681 --> 01:11:51,139
l was talking to Mahler.

1169
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:52,975
Why are you calling me?

1170
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:55,143
l wanted to speak to you.
You need some more granola?

1171
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:57,104
Or ice-cream sandwiches?

1172
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:00,232
Come on.

1173
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:03,902
I mean, are we
seeing each other or not?

1174
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:05,445
Well, that's what
l wanna talk about.

1175
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:09,199
l don't know, l mean,
l'm leaving in,
like, a week.

1176
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:12,077
Hurt people hurt people.

1177
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:15,914
"Hurt people hurt people"?
Hurt people hurt people.

1178
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:19,084
lt's something
a singing coach of mine
told me.

1179
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,086
Shit!

1180
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,338
Sorry.
ls somebody there?

1181
01:12:23,423 --> 01:12:24,423
No.

1182
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:28,343
l just spilled my champagne.
Forget it.

1183
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:31,054
You never fucked that guy
who plays guitar with you?

1184
01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:32,139
No!

1185
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:34,850
l don't want this
to sound dramatic,

1186
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:38,395
and l wasn't
gonna say anything,
and Gina's taking me.

1187
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:41,398
l mean, it's not yours.
lt's. . .

1188
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:43,942
l found out
a couple of days ago.

1189
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:49,197
l don't know,
it's gotta be my ex's,

1190
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:51,533
because l'm six
or seven weeks,

1191
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,286
and you and l
have only just. . .

1192
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:57,497
And you used a condom.

1193
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:04,796
l didn't wanna tell you.
l mean, it's weird.

1194
01:13:06,424 --> 01:13:08,300
l've been pregnant
this whole time.

1195
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:10,802
Uh-huh.

1196
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:17,726
l made
an appointment for a D&C.
l'm really sensitive to pain,

1197
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:20,062
so l asked for anesthesia.

1198
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:24,816
Sorry,
l'm trying to get drunk now.
l can't eat after 10:00.

1199
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:27,319
l'll take you to it.

1200
01:13:28,196 --> 01:13:32,824
How's that gonna work?
Am l gonna drive
you to take me?

1201
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:42,375
Can you turn it down?
l'm sorry.

1202
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:45,087
My head is killing me.

1203
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:47,005
No, it's fine.
Don't worry.

1204
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:53,178
lt's your day, or. . .
You know what l mean.

1205
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:07,984
We'll be here
when you get out.

1206
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:09,945
Okay. Thanks.

1207
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:14,241
Don't be nervous.

1208
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:18,703
l just don't know what
l'm doing with my life.

1209
01:14:19,831 --> 01:14:20,872
You're of value.

1210
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:23,291
l know that.
You don't have to say that.

1211
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:33,552
We could get
her some flowers.

1212
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:39,057
l thought since she
couldn't eat, she might
be hungry when it's over.

1213
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:48,733
Here.

1214
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:55,907
Well, when you're ready.

1215
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:58,076
Thanks.

1216
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:02,914
Could we go?

1217
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:06,585
They apparently
won't let us go
until you pee.

1218
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:07,794
Oh.

1219
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:11,715
l don't have to.

1220
01:15:13,301 --> 01:15:16,761
Maybe when you
get to the bathroom,
you'll feel like it.

1221
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:19,973
l need to lie here
for a little longer.

1222
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:23,226
But you'll probably
be more comfortable
lying at home.

1223
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:25,270
Let her sleep, man.

1224
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:30,150
You like me so much more
than you think you do.

1225
01:15:37,909 --> 01:15:39,075
Okay.

1226
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,745
Wish it wasn't too late
to get my medical degree.

1227
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:43,538
lt's not too late.

1228
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:45,373
l'd be over 50 by
the time l graduated.

1229
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,334
What is it?
Four years, right?

1230
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:51,880
Yeah, but l know myself.
l'd procrastinate,
take time off.

1231
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:55,759
Eight years at best.
Who's gonna hire a 49. . .

1232
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:58,428
Let's just call it 50.
A 50-year-old vet?

1233
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:02,390
l'm confused.
Are you going to vet school
or regular medical school?

1234
01:16:03,935 --> 01:16:05,477
Neither, clearly.

1235
01:16:06,938 --> 01:16:09,564
l have to get back
for Mahler's pills.

1236
01:16:13,444 --> 01:16:15,737
lt's a stupid rule.
l mean, what does peeing
have to do with anything?

1237
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:17,822
Fabula makes this
rice dish with pineapples

1238
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:19,866
and raisins.
lt's really delicious.

1239
01:16:19,951 --> 01:16:21,034
l think you'll
find lots of girls

1240
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:22,118
who'll be able
to make that dish.

1241
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:24,663
No, no, no. This is
a Brazilian specialty.

1242
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:25,747
Still.

1243
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:27,749
Are you guys
Florence's friends?

1244
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:29,042
Yeah.
Yeah.

1245
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:32,170
Okay. She's sleeping
and she wants to
stay the night.

1246
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:33,713
Did she pee?

1247
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:35,882
You wanna come in,
watch a video?

1248
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:37,592
No,
l should get going.

1249
01:16:37,677 --> 01:16:38,760
Where?

1250
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:41,388
l think l'll go back to
the motel, take a nap.

1251
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:42,889
Didn't sleep too
well last night.

1252
01:16:42,974 --> 01:16:45,100
l'm leaving in,
like, a week.

1253
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:47,269
We'll hang out some more,
don't worry.

1254
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:50,605
You're sure it's okay l left?
She might wake
up and be scared.

1255
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:53,024
She'll be fine.
The nurse seemed nice.

1256
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:54,901
l had to
get back for Mahler.
l understand.

1257
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:56,403
No, l know. l'm not
explaining myself to you.

1258
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:58,071
l'm just saying.
You're just saying, right?

1259
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:00,949
Come on, one drink.
No, l really gotta go.

1260
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:02,075
Okay.

1261
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:08,790
l appreciate your friendship.

1262
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:17,340
Can l ask,
what do people say about me?

1263
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:20,218
Like, negative
things l wouldn't know.

1264
01:17:20,303 --> 01:17:21,344
Let me go, man.

1265
01:17:21,429 --> 01:17:24,848
Come on,
l'm sure people must trash me
when l'm not around.

1266
01:17:25,683 --> 01:17:26,766
They don't trash you.

1267
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:28,601
Okay, what criticisms
do they have?

1268
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:31,521
l don't know.

1269
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:34,399
l'd say the biggest
criticism they have is that

1270
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:36,860
you have trouble
making fun of yourself.

1271
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:39,070
Really?

1272
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:43,199
That's incredible.
l'm the funniest person
l know.

1273
01:17:43,284 --> 01:17:45,535
Well, not about yourself.

1274
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:46,953
Really?
That's what people say.

1275
01:17:47,038 --> 01:17:48,330
l wouldn't get too
worried about it.

1276
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:49,956
These things
aren't difficult to fix.

1277
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:51,416
Right.

1278
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:57,797
People say they think
you lie about things
you don't need to lie about,

1279
01:17:57,882 --> 01:18:00,175
that you don't
make any effort,

1280
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:01,384
that you're
a bit of a prince.

1281
01:18:01,469 --> 01:18:05,180
Who says?
Who are these people?
That's just totally insane.

1282
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:06,765
l'm just telling
you what l've heard.

1283
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:08,933
lf anything
l'd say l'm too honest,
don't you think?

1284
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:11,770
Yeah.
l mean,
l'm pretty upfront with. . .

1285
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:13,730
No effort?
Mmm-hmm.

1286
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:17,525
l'm making
my brother's family
a doghouse.

1287
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:19,319
You know,
l brought my tool
kit out from New York.

1288
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:20,695
They had to check my
bag because of that.

1289
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:23,448
l always do carry-on.
l have calluses.

1290
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:26,242
Does Beller say this?

1291
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:28,536
l think Beller said it, yeah.
And others, too.

1292
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:31,456
Johno, maybe once, and Anna.

1293
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,918
That's funny.
Yeah.

1294
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:37,921
Completely wrong,
but funny.

1295
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:41,800
All right.

1296
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:00,985
Hello?

1297
01:19:02,822 --> 01:19:04,656
Sara?
There's the strange man

1298
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,741
who's been
sleeping in my room.

1299
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:10,328
Oh, this is Muriel.
Hey.

1300
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:12,747
l heard you killed our dog.

1301
01:19:12,832 --> 01:19:15,500
No. No, no,
he's all better.

1302
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,252
We brought him
back yesterday.

1303
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:20,880
Well, where is he?
Mahler!

1304
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:24,300
Mahler? Mahler!

1305
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:28,054
We leave for Australia
tomorrow morning.

1306
01:19:28,848 --> 01:19:30,432
lsn't that like
a 20-hour flight?

1307
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:32,475
No, it's 1 4.

1308
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:36,062
So that's,
like, seven movies.

1309
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:39,607
Yeah.

1310
01:19:43,362 --> 01:19:44,362
Hello?

1311
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:47,490
Party of 20-year-olds
has suddenly happened
at my house.

1312
01:19:47,575 --> 01:19:50,160
Hey, man.

1313
01:19:50,244 --> 01:19:51,244
How was your nap?

1314
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:52,287
Yeah, it was fine.

1315
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:53,455
Where are you?

1316
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:56,416
l'm having dinner
with my family.

1317
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,293
Your parents?
No.

1318
01:19:58,377 --> 01:19:59,461
My other family.

1319
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:00,879
Fabula.

1320
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:02,088
Mmm-hmm.

1321
01:20:02,173 --> 01:20:03,298
Do you want me to
come over there?

1322
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:05,800
No! lt's okay.

1323
01:20:05,885 --> 01:20:07,677
Just don't do anything.

1324
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:09,137
l'm not sure
l know what you mean.

1325
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:10,638
You should come here after.

1326
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:11,973
l really gotta go.

1327
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:13,641
Okay. Call you later.

1328
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:20,815
Hey! He just got
out of the hospital.

1329
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,025
l'm sorry.

1330
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:23,776
You know,
don't give him beer.

1331
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:24,903
l'm so sorry.

1332
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:27,113
He's got
an autoimmune disorder,
all right? Mahler.

1333
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:28,740
l didn't know.
Mahler.

1334
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,037
Mahler.

1335
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:15,578
Hey, man,
you got a cool place.

1336
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:17,705
Oh, thanks.
lt's not totally mine,
but. . .

1337
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:19,707
Yeah, what do you do?

1338
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:22,627
Oh, l'm kind of doing
nothing for a while.

1339
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:24,629
ls that coke?

1340
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:25,838
Yup.

1341
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:27,549
l'd heard coke was in again.

1342
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:29,217
Yeah, you want some?

1343
01:21:29,677 --> 01:21:30,677
Um. . .

1344
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:38,434
l'm Rich.
Roger Greenberg.

1345
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:41,854
ls it okay to mix
coke and Zoloft?

1346
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:45,441
Yeah, totally.
l haven't done this in,
like, 1 5 years.

1347
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:50,321
Since college, or since
a couple of years out.
lt's very unlike me.

1348
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:56,661
l actually hate coke.

1349
01:21:57,079 --> 01:21:59,455
l hate it politically
and l hate how
it makes me feel.

1350
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:00,832
But when it's done,
l may have to

1351
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:03,418
kill one of you out
of sheer frustration.

1352
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:05,837
l'm gonna change the record.
We need better coke music.

1353
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:07,797
Oh, yeah.
Put on some Korn.

1354
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:09,132
l got the perfect thing.

1355
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:16,097
Hello?
Hey, man.

1356
01:22:16,181 --> 01:22:17,348
Hey, man.

1357
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:18,933
l just did a line.

1358
01:22:19,018 --> 01:22:21,436
l think the last time
l did coke was with you.

1359
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,771
lt was just a line,
but l feel really wired.

1360
01:22:24,732 --> 01:22:25,982
l guess my tolerance is less.

1361
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:27,150
Okay.

1362
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:28,776
Hey, you done with dinner?

1363
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:30,320
No, we're still eating.

1364
01:22:30,404 --> 01:22:32,322
Put on AC/DC!

1365
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:33,489
You sure you
don't want me there?

1366
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:34,616
Yeah.

1367
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:35,658
l've gotta go, man.

1368
01:22:35,743 --> 01:22:37,785
l almost feel like l can
get in a car and drive.

1369
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:39,495
Don't do that.

1370
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:41,456
You gotta come
here when you're done.

1371
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:42,665
Oh, dude! Come on !

1372
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:44,375
Fuck off, Jerry!

1373
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,793
Tonight's not good, man.

1374
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:47,337
Man, you gotta come!

1375
01:22:48,047 --> 01:22:49,714
l can't believe
you lied to me
about your dinner.

1376
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:50,965
Put on AC/DC!

1377
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:52,550
lt's actually
a pretty fun party.

1378
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:53,968
Man, I can't!

1379
01:22:54,053 --> 01:22:55,303
All right. l got to go.

1380
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:57,889
We wanna
hear AC/DC!

1381
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:03,436
Don't, okay?

1382
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:07,482
Come on ! Duran Duran's
great coke music.
Give it a chance.

1383
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:09,567
Let's maybe not
keep saying coke
in every sentence.

1384
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:13,237
l read an article.
Aren't you guys all just
fucking on the lnternet?

1385
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:14,614
Not all of us.

1386
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:15,948
But some?

1387
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:17,325
l guess some.

1388
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:21,371
Yeah,
l think Paige has a site,
but it's more art than porn.

1389
01:23:21,455 --> 01:23:22,997
They shot a skin
flick on my campus,

1390
01:23:23,082 --> 01:23:25,416
a couple guys
and some townies,
and they acted in it.

1391
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:27,168
Sick.
Hey, can't we put on
some Korn?

1392
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:29,754
No, we can't put on
fucking Korn. Jesus!

1393
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:32,340
You guys smoke crack
at all?

1394
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:34,676
l don't.
l have, once or twice.

1395
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,135
l might get back into drugs.

1396
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:38,096
l've got a Vicodin,
if you want.

1397
01:23:39,306 --> 01:23:41,516
l could use that, actually.

1398
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,017
You want
a neck massage?

1399
01:23:43,102 --> 01:23:44,268
Uh. . .

1400
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:49,023
Okay. Normally,
l'd say no because
l'm a little OCD, but. . .

1401
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:52,235
Okay.

1402
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:59,117
That's great.

1403
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:01,536
Are you kids really
different from me?

1404
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:03,204
l mean,
do the movies,
and the iPods,

1405
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:04,872
and the facility
with MySpace pages

1406
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:05,998
make you guys
really different?

1407
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:07,375
l don't know.

1408
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,836
Every article l read
seems to be saying that.

1409
01:24:11,422 --> 01:24:13,965
Definitely feel it.
Good coke.

1410
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:17,343
What?
Nothing.

1411
01:24:17,428 --> 01:24:18,678
You're funny.

1412
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:21,556
You're mean.

1413
01:24:22,141 --> 01:24:24,767
The thing about you kids
is you're all
kind of insensitive.

1414
01:24:24,852 --> 01:24:26,310
l'm glad l grew
up when l did,

1415
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:27,895
'cause your parents
were too perfect
at parenting.

1416
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:31,899
All that Baby Mozart
and Dan Zanes songs.

1417
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:35,236
You're so sincere and
interested in things.

1418
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:38,197
There's a confidence
in you guys
that's horrifying.

1419
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:40,783
You're all ADD
and carpal tunnel.

1420
01:24:40,868 --> 01:24:42,910
You wouldn't know agoraphobia
if it bit you in the ass,

1421
01:24:42,995 --> 01:24:44,287
and it makes you mean.

1422
01:24:44,371 --> 01:24:45,955
You say things to
someone like me,

1423
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:49,417
who's older and smarter,
with this blithe air.

1424
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:51,252
l'm freaked out
by you kids.

1425
01:24:53,547 --> 01:24:57,383
l hope l die before
l end up meeting one of you
in a job interview.

1426
01:24:58,051 --> 01:24:59,093
Fuck or fight?

1427
01:24:59,178 --> 01:25:00,136
What?

1428
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,679
Fuck or fight?

1429
01:25:02,389 --> 01:25:03,973
What are you
fighting against?

1430
01:25:04,057 --> 01:25:05,516
What do you got?

1431
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:09,061
Uh. . . l don't
have much.

1432
01:25:09,146 --> 01:25:12,064
Ah-ha! Then that's what
l'm fighting against,
not much.

1433
01:25:12,316 --> 01:25:13,316
Boom !

1434
01:25:15,027 --> 01:25:18,488
What the fuck?
Rich, you asshole.

1435
01:25:18,572 --> 01:25:20,573
l didn't do anything, man.

1436
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:21,783
Oh. Sorry.

1437
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:26,871
Hey, get off the stereo.
l was listening to that.

1438
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:29,707
Where's the Duran Duran?

1439
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:31,000
"Where's the Duran Duran?"

1440
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:33,085
Hey, careful, those
are my brother's records.

1441
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:34,253
"Those are my
brother's records."

1442
01:25:34,338 --> 01:25:35,379
Fuck off.

1443
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:37,381
Jesus!

1444
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:38,716
There's something
in the pool !

1445
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:47,475
Hey, don't feed him.
No, don't feed him !

1446
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:50,561
Mahler, drop it!
Mahler, drop it.

1447
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:53,481
Mahler, drop it.
Drop it. Drop it.

1448
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:55,900
Ow!

1449
01:26:04,243 --> 01:26:05,743
God, what is it?

1450
01:26:05,828 --> 01:26:09,580
l think it's
a bird or an opossum,
or something.

1451
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:12,875
lt's a. . .
l think we've had
one of these before.

1452
01:26:25,097 --> 01:26:27,431
Holy shit!

1453
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:47,618
All right.
lt's coming to get your ass!

1454
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:51,622
l'm sorry your dog
has AlDS.

1455
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:55,710
He doesn't have AlDS.
lt's an autoimmune disorder.

1456
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,495
How is Lenny?

1457
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:32,955
Hey, man.

1458
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:36,834
Hey, you okay, man?
ls that pot?
Where did you get that?

1459
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,420
You want a puff?
No, man, l quit.
You know that.

1460
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:41,839
Okay, man. Okay.

1461
01:27:42,883 --> 01:27:46,093
lsn't this weird?
So, how'd it go?

1462
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:48,095
Fine.
And?

1463
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,805
l think

1464
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:52,475
we're gonna have another try.
You're shitting me.

1465
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:53,684
Please don't make
this hard for me.

1466
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:54,810
Oh, God, man.

1467
01:27:54,895 --> 01:27:56,479
Don't give in.

1468
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:59,649
l know it's the harder,
more painful decision
to stay free,

1469
01:27:59,733 --> 01:28:01,525
but that's what
adulthood is.

1470
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:02,902
l mean, l could
just stay with Florence

1471
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:04,612
because it's easy,
but l don't want easy.

1472
01:28:04,696 --> 01:28:06,697
You've been dating
Florence for a month.

1473
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:09,116
l've been married for
1 0 years with a child.

1474
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:10,409
Don't tell me
about adulthood.

1475
01:28:10,494 --> 01:28:11,577
We're not dating, exactly.

1476
01:28:11,662 --> 01:28:12,745
That's my point!

1477
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:14,997
Hey, you're
shouting at me.

1478
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:20,211
lt's been a really
hard time for me, Roger.
l mean, l miss my family.

1479
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,171
l feel like

1480
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:24,632
all the hard work
l've done over the years,

1481
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:26,133
kicking the drugs,
being a dad,

1482
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:28,260
l feel like it's all
slipping away from me.

1483
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:29,804
lt's not going away.

1484
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:32,306
lt's transforming.
You're going through
something, which means. . .

1485
01:28:32,391 --> 01:28:35,309
l don't think you
understand what it's been
like for me out here,

1486
01:28:35,394 --> 01:28:38,646
how the life l'd hoped for. . .

1487
01:28:39,982 --> 01:28:44,819
lt's huge to
finally embrace the life
you never planned on.

1488
01:28:48,115 --> 01:28:50,741
l wanted to make
that record.

1489
01:28:50,826 --> 01:28:53,703
We never would've
survived at a major label
with those restrictions.

1490
01:28:53,787 --> 01:28:54,787
How the fuck do you know?

1491
01:28:54,871 --> 01:28:56,205
Because that's not
how the world works.

1492
01:28:56,289 --> 01:28:59,417
What could you possibly know
about how the world works?

1493
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:00,835
Listen, man,
l think you're playing out

1494
01:29:00,919 --> 01:29:02,169
some old family
dynamic here. . .

1495
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:03,838
Apropos of what we
were saying before

1496
01:29:03,922 --> 01:29:05,381
about what
people say about us?

1497
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:07,216
People feel you hold on
to petty resentments.

1498
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,468
You asked me what
people say about you.

1499
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:11,470
l don't want to know.
Yeah, well,
you should know.

1500
01:29:11,555 --> 01:29:13,097
People think you
play the victim.

1501
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:14,598
And l don't mean
this in a bad way,

1502
01:29:14,683 --> 01:29:16,017
but you let people
feel sorry for you

1503
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:17,685
when you're
really just protecting
your own narcissism.

1504
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:18,728
l don't want to know!

1505
01:29:18,812 --> 01:29:21,731
Well, that's why l didn't
want to be in a fucking
band with you !

1506
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:24,900
Because you won't
acknowledge your own shit.

1507
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:28,612
And you were
fucked up all the time!

1508
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:32,867
What do you want
me to say, huh?
What do you want me to say?

1509
01:29:32,951 --> 01:29:35,786
l had no idea that
would be our only offer.

1510
01:29:36,455 --> 01:29:38,122
l didn't think that
l had the power to blow it.

1511
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:41,417
l thought that we were all
just giving our two cents.

1512
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:44,086
Fuck, l didn't know
l was gonna be

1513
01:29:44,171 --> 01:29:46,797
the one to make
the band fall apart.

1514
01:29:46,882 --> 01:29:50,301
You know, maybe,
obviously, l would
do it differently now!

1515
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:56,766
Of course l know what
it's like to live a life
l didn't plan on.

1516
01:29:56,850 --> 01:30:00,102
What the fuck do
you think l'm doing
right now?

1517
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:11,322
Florence told me
you were in the hospital.

1518
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:16,368
l'd know,
l understand
about those things.

1519
01:30:16,453 --> 01:30:18,412
You know,
we could've talked about it,

1520
01:30:18,497 --> 01:30:19,830
maybe made each
other feel better,

1521
01:30:19,915 --> 01:30:23,334
but instead we never talk
about anything good.

1522
01:30:31,635 --> 01:30:34,095
This is a small thing,

1523
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:36,764
and it's probably
boring for you,

1524
01:30:36,848 --> 01:30:39,767
but it would've been nice
if you'd have made
an effort to know Vic.

1525
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:40,935
Who's Vic?

1526
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:41,977
My son.

1527
01:30:42,062 --> 01:30:45,231
Oh, Victor. l didn't
recognize the diminutive.

1528
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:11,632
Hi, it's Florence.
Leave a message.

1529
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:12,883
Florence.

1530
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:16,262
Florence, l'm calling
to say l'm sorry

1531
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:18,597
you had to go through
what you're going through.

1532
01:31:18,682 --> 01:31:22,643
And Mahler's fine.
He ate pizza.

1533
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:27,982
l'm leaving this
in your voicemail,
but it's really a letter.

1534
01:31:28,066 --> 01:31:31,110
l get so angry about
the world, you know?

1535
01:31:32,445 --> 01:31:33,571
lf l knew who
to write a letter to

1536
01:31:33,655 --> 01:31:36,365
about all the stupidity
in the world, l'd do it.

1537
01:31:39,077 --> 01:31:43,080
You're 25.
l was just 27.

1538
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:47,918
You're brave.
Young people are brave.

1539
01:31:49,421 --> 01:31:51,672
When l was a kid,
l was a leader

1540
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:54,008
and most of the kids
always looked up to me.

1541
01:31:55,594 --> 01:31:58,470
l thought l might go
into space, you know,
as an astronaut.

1542
01:31:58,638 --> 01:32:01,682
l can't even
swim in the fucking pool.

1543
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:03,601
My brother's in Vietnam.

1544
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:06,187
We have the same parents.
l can't blame that.

1545
01:32:10,192 --> 01:32:13,861
l really love Phillip,
but l'm not supposed
to be on his bed.

1546
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:19,200
l love my parents.
l love Mahler.

1547
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:22,244
l miss my mom.

1548
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:26,999
l really like you.

1549
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:32,087
l just hate how
embarrassing it all is.
l don't understand.

1550
01:32:32,339 --> 01:32:33,714
What happened to me?

1551
01:32:34,341 --> 01:32:36,258
Where does experience go?

1552
01:32:37,219 --> 01:32:40,763
Remember Charlie Sheen
standing on his balcony
in Wall Street?

1553
01:32:40,847 --> 01:32:43,682
Did you see that movie?
Saying, "Who am l?"

1554
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:46,810
Phillip and l used to
make so much fun of it.

1555
01:32:46,895 --> 01:32:48,979
l'm thinking, now,
it wasn't so stupid.

1556
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:54,735
Somebody once said to me,
"Hurt people hurt people."

1557
01:32:56,655 --> 01:32:59,240
lt's kind of trite,
but it stayed with me.

1558
01:32:59,324 --> 01:33:03,786
Oh, man ! That was you,
like, a few days ago.

1559
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:06,413
l used to have
a really good memory, too.

1560
01:33:06,498 --> 01:33:10,084
Anyway, we do. . .
l do hurt people.

1561
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:14,171
Hurt people.

1562
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:18,676
l think lvan and l broke up.

1563
01:33:24,224 --> 01:33:28,936
Florence, l really like you.

1564
01:33:30,355 --> 01:33:31,981
Love, Roger.

1565
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:57,548
Assholes.

1566
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:05,806
Dicks.

1567
01:34:07,142 --> 01:34:09,101
l don't understand
why she did it.

1568
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:11,395
Good morning, sunshine.

1569
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:13,230
Holy shit!

1570
01:34:14,232 --> 01:34:15,774
How you feeling, Sunny?

1571
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:17,484
What's "Sunny"?

1572
01:34:18,111 --> 01:34:20,571
We decided that's
our name for you.

1573
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:22,865
l think l'm still drunk.

1574
01:34:29,748 --> 01:34:33,000
Hey, they printed my
letter about Pakistan.

1575
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:34,501
Cool.

1576
01:34:36,588 --> 01:34:39,340
"Roger Greenberg.
Hollywood, California."

1577
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:44,136
l mean,
l've got no problem
giving some guy a blowjob,

1578
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:47,681
but she has taken
it to the extreme.

1579
01:34:48,266 --> 01:34:50,893
Why do
guys like to do that?
Come on you and spread it?

1580
01:34:50,977 --> 01:34:53,437
They don't all like it.
 They do.

1581
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:56,398
No, they don't.
You just like guys
who do that.

1582
01:34:56,483 --> 01:34:57,608
Fuck you !

1583
01:34:57,859 --> 01:35:00,611
You're really good with him.
You have dogs?

1584
01:35:01,363 --> 01:35:03,864
No, Florence showed me
how to do it.

1585
01:35:04,783 --> 01:35:07,785
Did you start an affair
with Phillip's assistant?

1586
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:09,328
No.

1587
01:35:09,454 --> 01:35:11,455
l'm jealous.

1588
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:15,167
You should come to
Australia with us.

1589
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:18,629
Yeah?
There's a great Kinks song
called Australia.

1590
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:22,674
Totally.
You should totally come.

1591
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:25,094
Maybe l will.

1592
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:26,345
Okay.

1593
01:35:26,429 --> 01:35:30,099
But you better hurry.
We gotta leave in,
like, five minutes.

1594
01:35:40,318 --> 01:35:42,986
Fuck!
What are we gonna
do about Mahler?

1595
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:44,988
Oh, fuck.

1596
01:35:49,661 --> 01:35:51,120
Can l ask you guys a favor?

1597
01:35:51,204 --> 01:35:53,664
Yeah. What's happening?
How you doing?
l'm Roger, by the way.

1598
01:35:53,748 --> 01:35:55,582
Marlon and Peggy.
Sorry it's such a mess.

1599
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:56,875
Yeah,
we're gonna go home.

1600
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,836
Can you take Mahler
until Wednesday?

1601
01:35:58,920 --> 01:35:59,920
Uh. . .

1602
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:02,423
Yeah, sure.
We love Mahler.
Come here, baby.

1603
01:36:02,507 --> 01:36:03,674
Great.

1604
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:10,764
No, wait a second.

1605
01:36:12,851 --> 01:36:14,810
You know,
run it by his nose.

1606
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:16,353
Okay.
No sweat.

1607
01:36:16,438 --> 01:36:20,232
Thanks, man.
And he takes prednisone,
which is a steroid,

1608
01:36:20,316 --> 01:36:22,609
twice a day for
the next three days.
l'll write this out.

1609
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:24,695
Also,
there's an antibiotic
and a blood thinner,

1610
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:26,029
but l'll write
it down for you.

1611
01:36:26,072 --> 01:36:28,282
Let's go! We still
have to get you a ticket.
What time is it?

1612
01:36:28,366 --> 01:36:30,742
Come on !
lt's fucking peaceful,
is what it is.

1613
01:36:30,869 --> 01:36:32,953
l love it.
Did you see sharks last time?
Oh, fuck!

1614
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:35,372
Okay.

1615
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:39,710
You know what
really pisses me off,
is fucking Lily.

1616
01:36:39,836 --> 01:36:43,505
Once again.
l still can't get over that.
What a slut.

1617
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:45,674
Like, l'm thinking
about it now,

1618
01:36:45,758 --> 01:36:47,634
and it's so much worse
than l remembered.

1619
01:36:47,719 --> 01:36:49,428
Now that l feel like,
maybe l was drunk
at the time.

1620
01:36:49,512 --> 01:36:52,806
l've seen a great white,
and there are
the most amazing wrecks.

1621
01:36:52,891 --> 01:36:54,766
l literally cannot wait.

1622
01:36:54,851 --> 01:36:56,477
l love that
you're doing this.

1623
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:57,853
ls this completely crazy?

1624
01:36:57,937 --> 01:36:59,188
No!

1625
01:36:59,272 --> 01:37:01,565
l mean, it's what
people do, right?

1626
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:03,609
You'll love Australia.

1627
01:37:03,693 --> 01:37:04,985
For some people,
this is nothing.

1628
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:07,362
And who knows
how much longer the Reef's
gonna be around?

1629
01:37:07,447 --> 01:37:10,157
There's this starfish
that's killing
the marine life.

1630
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:11,408
Roger, are you certified?

1631
01:37:11,493 --> 01:37:12,576
To what?

1632
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:13,911
Dive.

1633
01:37:14,579 --> 01:37:16,705
No, l don't really swim.

1634
01:37:23,588 --> 01:37:25,923
You can go look at
whales while we dive.

1635
01:37:26,591 --> 01:37:28,383
Sunny will look at whales.

1636
01:37:28,468 --> 01:37:31,845
Okay, you know what?
You can cut out
the Sunny business.

1637
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:36,808
Oh, my God,
look at this guy in these
overalls and the clogs.

1638
01:37:36,893 --> 01:37:38,143
l left my ChapStick.
Oh, my God.

1639
01:37:38,228 --> 01:37:40,312
Are overalls back in now,
or is he crazy?

1640
01:37:40,396 --> 01:37:43,357
No, l saw a bunch of
people in overalls. . .

1641
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:56,203
Hey,
will you check this out?

1642
01:37:56,287 --> 01:37:57,579
What the fuck
is that?

1643
01:37:57,664 --> 01:37:58,705
That is so weird.

1644
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:01,041
l know, right? lt's so itchy.
Don't touch it.
Don't touch it.

1645
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:05,003
You know what?
l'm supposed to get
someone from the hospital.

1646
01:38:05,088 --> 01:38:06,880
No, no, no.
Hold it. Hey! Hey, hold it!

1647
01:38:06,965 --> 01:38:08,799
Can you open my door?
No, you're our prisoner.

1648
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:11,260
Exactly.
Come on, open
the fucking door, please.

1649
01:38:11,344 --> 01:38:12,636
Okay, fine.
Come on.

1650
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,596
Roger, it's a rental.
Open it.

1651
01:38:14,681 --> 01:38:16,306
Would you stop?
Sara, open the fucking door!

1652
01:38:16,391 --> 01:38:18,350
l'm trying.
Stop pulling on it!

1653
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:20,602
You know, l can't go,
l can't afford it

1654
01:38:20,687 --> 01:38:23,814
and l have to
pick up my friend.

1655
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:25,732
Have a good time,
all right?

1656
01:38:28,528 --> 01:38:29,653
Bye!

1657
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:16,366
l've got to get insurance.
The anesthesia's
so expensive.

1658
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:18,744
l'm such a baby
about pain.

1659
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:22,956
And l stayed overnight.

1660
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:26,960
l'm glad your brother's
coming back next week.

1661
01:39:27,045 --> 01:39:29,046
l need to work more hours.

1662
01:39:37,221 --> 01:39:38,430
Thanks.

1663
01:39:43,061 --> 01:39:45,354
l really picked
my lip in my sleep,

1664
01:39:45,938 --> 01:39:48,815
which was possibly
about finding a pet
in the Canyons.

1665
01:39:50,234 --> 01:39:51,401
Do you, uh,

1666
01:39:53,529 --> 01:39:54,738
get The New York Times?

1667
01:39:54,822 --> 01:39:55,989
No.

1668
01:39:56,908 --> 01:39:59,743
lt's good to get the paper.
l'll pick you up one.

1669
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:01,036
Okay.

1670
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:04,915
Did you get my message?

1671
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:07,793
l haven't checked yet.
What did you say?

1672
01:40:08,503 --> 01:40:09,503
Um. . .

1673
01:40:10,338 --> 01:40:13,799
l reassessed
the movie Wall Street,
among other things.

1674
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:16,593
l don't know it.

1675
01:40:20,181 --> 01:40:24,434
l wasn't gonna give it to you
'cause l was pissed,
but you can open it.

1676
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:26,353
Happy birthday, again.

1677
01:40:27,563 --> 01:40:28,647
Thanks.

1678
01:40:31,984 --> 01:40:35,612
Now you have the set.
Not that they're a set.

1679
01:40:37,907 --> 01:40:39,741
What about your niece?

1680
01:40:39,826 --> 01:40:42,494
Remember,
the sticks are too old.

1681
01:40:42,578 --> 01:40:45,789
She's coming
over this weekend.
l framed her picture.

1682
01:40:53,756 --> 01:40:55,382
Do you have
a tape-measure?

1683
01:40:55,466 --> 01:40:57,968
l think there's a ruler
in the desk drawer.

1684
01:41:06,561 --> 01:41:08,103
Do you have a hammer?

1685
01:41:08,187 --> 01:41:09,730
Maybe in there.

1686
01:41:10,815 --> 01:41:11,815
Here?

1687
01:41:13,192 --> 01:41:14,901
You want it on
this wall, here?

1688
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:17,654
Okay.

1689
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:24,161
Cool.

1690
01:41:25,288 --> 01:41:26,997
Like a professional.

1691
01:41:27,665 --> 01:41:29,708
Well, l am a professional.

1692
01:41:31,419 --> 01:41:33,295
l mean, l build things.

1693
01:41:42,346 --> 01:41:46,016
l know you know
l was in a hospital.
l'm not hiding it.

1694
01:41:49,896 --> 01:41:52,355
But it's not what
defines me, you know?

1695
01:41:54,025 --> 01:41:55,525
l understand.

1696
01:42:08,706 --> 01:42:10,874
l want to
listen to my message.

1697
01:42:15,630 --> 01:42:19,382
l'd had some to drink.

1698
01:42:33,648 --> 01:42:34,981
Gina.

1699
01:42:41,239 --> 01:42:42,614
My mom.

1700
01:42:48,788 --> 01:42:51,748
Okay. This is you.
