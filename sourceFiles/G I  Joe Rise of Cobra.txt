2
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,828
James McCullen, you Scottish pig,

3
00:01:15,936 --> 00:01:19,428
you've been found guilty of treason
for the sale of military arms

4
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,737
to the enemies of our Lord,
King Louis XIII,

5
00:01:22,843 --> 00:01:25,812
even whilst you sold arms
to our Lord himself.

6
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,682
Your king is a vile bag of filth
who murders his own allies.

7
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:34,378
I should have charged him double.

8
00:01:34,488 --> 00:01:39,391
You tried to overthrow the Crown
in conspiracy with its enemies.

9
00:01:39,493 --> 00:01:42,724
Unlike your simpleton king,
his enemies know

10
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,164
that it is the true McCullen destiny
not simply to supply arms,

11
00:01:47,268 --> 00:01:48,860
but to run the wars!

12
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:51,699
Do you have anything else to say
before the sentence is carried out?

13
00:01:51,805 --> 00:01:53,295
Yes, I do.

14
00:01:53,407 --> 00:01:55,773
Clan McCullen is far greater
and more powerful

15
00:01:55,876 --> 00:01:57,969
than any of you could ever imagine.

16
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,014
My sons will continue to rise
long after I am gone,

17
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:03,481
as will their sons

18
00:02:03,584 --> 00:02:06,382
and, God willing, their sons.

19
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:09,047
It shall not end with my death!

20
00:02:09,156 --> 00:02:12,557
We are not going to kill you, McCullen.

21
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,220
We're going to make an example of you!

22
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:23,462
So that no man, woman nor child may
ever see your treacherous face again,

23
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:27,940
you shall wear this mask
for the term of your natural life.

24
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:31,910
No! No! No!

25
00:02:45,326 --> 00:02:47,817
For nearly 4 centuries,
my ancestors have been

26
00:02:47,928 --> 00:02:50,692
the greatest creators of weaponry
in the world.

27
00:02:51,365 --> 00:02:53,731
But perhaps in this century,
I'll outdo them all.

28
00:02:56,704 --> 00:02:58,171
Nanomites, perfect little soldiers

29
00:02:58,272 --> 00:03:01,435
originally developed
to isolate and kill cancer cells.

30
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:02,839
But at MARS Industries,

31
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:05,410
and with the help
of a little NATO funding,

32
00:03:05,512 --> 00:03:08,743
we discovered how to program them
to do almost anything.

33
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:11,443
For example, eat metal.

34
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:15,655
Watch this test
of the world's first nanomite warhead.

35
00:03:17,057 --> 00:03:20,356
Each of these warheads
contains 7 million nanomites

36
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:23,453
and has the ability to eat anything
from a single tank

37
00:03:24,565 --> 00:03:26,089
to an entire city.

38
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:33,805
As you can see, it quickly converts
to eating any and all material in its path.

39
00:03:34,274 --> 00:03:38,301
Once unleashed,
the nanomites will not stop, ever.

40
00:03:38,412 --> 00:03:40,175
Once the target has been destroyed,

41
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,044
the launcher triggers
a kill switch unique to each warhead

42
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,450
that short-circuits the nanomites,
preventing any unwanted destruction.

43
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:50,648
Gentlemen, I'm pleased to announce
that tomorrow morning,

44
00:03:50,758 --> 00:03:55,218
your first order of nanotech warheads
ships from my factory in Kyrgyzstan.

45
00:04:13,113 --> 00:04:16,082
Weapons case on the move.
ETA 2 minutes to NATO team.

46
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:29,059
All right, listen up.
NATO wants the best of the best.

47
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:31,791
That's why we're here.
We got Panthers front and back.

48
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:33,230
RHINO's carrying the package
in the middle.

49
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,791
Minimum distance at all times.
Apaches are covering us from overhead.

50
00:04:36,904 --> 00:04:39,998
Detail, attention. Fall out, boys.

51
00:04:40,274 --> 00:04:42,538
Captain Hauser,
Mr. McCullen requires a signature.

52
00:04:42,643 --> 00:04:43,905
Not gonna explode, is it?

53
00:04:44,011 --> 00:04:46,377
They're not weaponized yet,
and the kill switches are inside.

54
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,278
All the same,
I'd avoid potholes if I were you.

55
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:52,651
- Hey, Bill?
- Yeah?

56
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:54,778
Put that in the RHINO, would you?

57
00:04:56,223 --> 00:04:57,383
All right, ladies! Mount up!

58
00:05:15,843 --> 00:05:18,368
Okay, Apaches, we're heavy,
so keep your eyes open.

59
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,879
Roger that.
Skies are clear all the way to Ganci.

60
00:05:29,857 --> 00:05:32,826
- Hey, Duke, I've been thinking.
- You know, I warned you about that.

61
00:05:32,926 --> 00:05:34,359
I've been thinking about
where we should transfer to.

62
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:36,088
- Don't say the Air Force.
- The Air Force!

63
00:05:36,196 --> 00:05:38,426
What did I say? I thought
we were done with this conversation.

64
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:40,090
You were done with this conversation,
not me.

65
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
You know, I've been flying

66
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:42,326
- since I was 13 years old.
-13 years old.

67
00:05:42,436 --> 00:05:44,904
You know, I don't think your dad's
crop-duster counts as hours logged.

68
00:05:47,374 --> 00:05:49,001
I'm talking jets, man. Jets.

69
00:05:49,109 --> 00:05:51,942
And you know I qualify
every time we're on leave.

70
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:53,939
- You want to get up in the air?
- Yeah.

71
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,210
- I'll buy you a trampoline.
- I filled out the application.

72
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:00,143
Really? They accept those in crayon?

73
00:06:00,254 --> 00:06:01,983
Come on, dude.
Give me one good reason why not.

74
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:05,490
'Cause I want to be on the ground,
in the fight, not flying over it.

75
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:20,334
Pioneer 1, this is Pioneer 2,
going night vision.

76
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,340
- Roger that.
- Go ahead and back off.

77
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:24,239
Give me some separation.

78
00:06:24,344 --> 00:06:26,710
Pioneer 1, this is Pioneer 2. Going NVS.

79
00:06:26,813 --> 00:06:27,813
Roger.

80
00:06:30,717 --> 00:06:32,309
Hey, Duke,
weren't we supposed to meet up

81
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:34,182
with the recon team at 40 klicks?

82
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:37,746
- Yeah. So?
- Well, we just passed kilometer 41.

83
00:06:40,027 --> 00:06:42,928
- Eyes out, eyes out!
- Sweep's still clear, sir.

84
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,692
Roger that.
There's nothing up here but us.

85
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,307
Tom, put a self-test on the flare
and start to scan for...

86
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,638
Holy...

87
00:06:58,111 --> 00:06:59,442
What the hell is that?

88
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:06,784
Pioneer 1, you've been hit.

89
00:07:11,491 --> 00:07:12,651
Stop!

90
00:07:15,462 --> 00:07:17,430
- Bird down! Bird down!
- Back up! Back up! Back up!

91
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:19,931
All units, we are under attack!
They're after the warheads!

92
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:21,057
Pioneer 2, engage!

93
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:24,194
- Put that asshole on the ground!
- Roger that. Put some hurt on this guy!

94
00:07:27,107 --> 00:07:29,667
Tommy guns. Firing, firing, firing!

95
00:07:32,412 --> 00:07:33,674
- Missiles armed.
- Match and shoot.

96
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,179
Match and shoot! Missiles off!

97
00:07:39,486 --> 00:07:41,044
They shot them right out of the air.

98
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:45,853
Oh, my God.

99
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:56,994
- Pioneer 2 is down! We've lost our air!
- They're boxing us in!

100
00:07:57,104 --> 00:07:59,664
All units, fan out!
I repeat, all units, fan out!

101
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:12,918
I want SAMs on that thing!
Light him up! Light him up!

102
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:23,795
He's coming around.
Get those. 50s on him!

103
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:31,770
Incoming!

104
00:08:34,174 --> 00:08:35,402
Hold on!

105
00:08:39,946 --> 00:08:41,243
You okay?

106
00:08:41,348 --> 00:08:44,374
Yeah, but my leg is pinned.
What the hell was that?

107
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:33,892
- Come on, we gotta get in this fight.
- Careful, my leg!

108
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,524
Come on, buddy, let's go.
Let's go, get up, come on!

109
00:09:40,006 --> 00:09:41,871
Duke, you gotta go get those warheads!

110
00:09:41,975 --> 00:09:44,205
Shut up! I gotta get you out of here first!

111
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:48,574
Fire at the opening!
Right side, right side!

112
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:56,351
Get up, get up, get up, get up!

113
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,690
My damn leg!

114
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:02,793
- You wait here, okay?
- Where are you going?

115
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:04,124
I gotta go get that case.

116
00:10:09,936 --> 00:10:11,494
Air Force, right.

117
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,973
Don't move!

118
00:10:20,213 --> 00:10:22,579
- Hello, Duke.
- Ana?

119
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:27,381
Now, you have to admit,
you had that coming.

120
00:10:38,965 --> 00:10:39,989
Ana!

121
00:10:42,869 --> 00:10:44,029
Ana!

122
00:11:18,738 --> 00:11:20,069
Bye-bye.

123
00:11:26,746 --> 00:11:28,976
Ana! Ana!

124
00:11:42,662 --> 00:11:43,924
Don't make me shoot a woman.

125
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:48,657
Incoming!

126
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,887
Stand down. Stand the hell down!

127
00:12:11,992 --> 00:12:14,222
- Put the weapon down, sir.
- We're not the enemy.

128
00:12:14,327 --> 00:12:16,557
Pointing your weapons at me doesn't
make you my friend, now, does it?

129
00:12:16,663 --> 00:12:17,721
Please hand over the case, sir.

130
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:20,299
I don't know you, and I sure as hell
don't know who they are,

131
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,231
and until I find out,
I'm not lowering anything

132
00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:23,563
and I ain't handing anything over.

133
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,298
If it weren't for us, you'd be out there
with the rest of your boys.

134
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:29,000
- So hand over the case.
- What's your unit?

135
00:12:29,109 --> 00:12:30,201
That's classified.

136
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,369
Someone would like to have
a word with you.

137
00:12:37,117 --> 00:12:38,709
State your name and rank.

138
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:41,852
- You first.
- My team just saved your life, son.

139
00:12:41,955 --> 00:12:44,116
This is the part
where you get to say thank you.

140
00:12:44,224 --> 00:12:45,589
Those aren't the words
that come to mind right now.

141
00:12:45,692 --> 00:12:47,922
I wasn't told anything
about any support for this mission,

142
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:49,461
so why don't you tell your team
to stand down?

143
00:12:49,562 --> 00:12:51,189
We could turn this
into one big turkey shoot.

144
00:12:51,298 --> 00:12:52,458
Yep.

145
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:54,893
Or not.

146
00:12:55,335 --> 00:12:56,996
Easy, Ripcord.

147
00:12:57,103 --> 00:12:58,764
- How do you know me?
- Expert marksman,

148
00:12:58,872 --> 00:13:02,808
second in your battalion.
Weapons specialist, jet qualified.

149
00:13:03,243 --> 00:13:04,676
- I told you.
- Not now, Rip.

150
00:13:04,778 --> 00:13:09,272
My name is General Clayton Abernathy.
Perhaps you've heard of me, Duke.

151
00:13:09,382 --> 00:13:12,249
General Hawk.
Afghanistan, NATO forward command.

152
00:13:12,352 --> 00:13:16,254
Yeah, that was my last job.
I'm in a whole new outfit now.

153
00:13:16,856 --> 00:13:19,791
Hey, I just need to deactivate
the tracking beacon for security.

154
00:13:19,893 --> 00:13:23,590
Put down that weapons case, son,
and let us deliver those warheads.

155
00:13:23,697 --> 00:13:25,426
No way. I signed for them.

156
00:13:25,532 --> 00:13:28,092
It's my mission, my package.
I carry them, I deliver them.

157
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:31,637
Well, that's just fine, but you seem to be
a little short of transportation right now,

158
00:13:31,738 --> 00:13:34,468
so my Team Alpha
will deliver you to me.

159
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,372
And where exactly are you, sir?

160
00:13:36,977 --> 00:13:38,808
Come see for yourself.

161
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:54,188
I thought all you Special Ops guys
were tough.

162
00:13:54,294 --> 00:13:56,888
We are tough. But we're also sensitive.

163
00:13:58,264 --> 00:13:59,526
I got it. Thanks.

164
00:13:59,632 --> 00:14:02,260
Wow, this is some primo stuff here.

165
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:06,265
Hey, bro, you got
some real lifelike hair over there.

166
00:14:06,373 --> 00:14:07,897
And a kung fu grip.

167
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:09,703
- Lie down.
- Okay.

168
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:11,276
What kind of outfit is this, anyway?

169
00:14:11,378 --> 00:14:13,812
It's not regular Army,
based on all the accents.

170
00:14:14,214 --> 00:14:16,273
You're British.
What are you, French North African?

171
00:14:16,383 --> 00:14:17,907
Morocco. Where were you born?

172
00:14:18,018 --> 00:14:20,213
Duke wasn't born.
He was government-issued.

173
00:14:20,787 --> 00:14:23,153
- What about you?
- He doesn't speak.

174
00:14:23,256 --> 00:14:25,224
- Why?
- He doesn't say.

175
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:28,283
He doesn't say.
So, somehow you're all in the same unit,

176
00:14:28,395 --> 00:14:30,226
but one you can't tell me
the name of, right?

177
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,592
We'd get tossed for telling.

178
00:14:31,698 --> 00:14:34,599
You're gonna go after those guys
that hit my convoy, huh?

179
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:39,403
Well, whoever you are
and whatever this unit is,

180
00:14:40,473 --> 00:14:41,838
I want in.

181
00:15:17,077 --> 00:15:18,203
General.

182
00:15:18,511 --> 00:15:19,910
- What's up, girl?
- Good job, Joes.

183
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:21,378
Outstanding.

184
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:25,014
Welcome to the Pit, Duke.
I've read a lot about you two.

185
00:15:25,118 --> 00:15:27,279
Well, you can't believe
everything you read. See, I actually...

186
00:15:27,387 --> 00:15:30,185
I understand we even tried to recruit you
a few years back.

187
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,656
- I never got asked to join any Op group.
- Really?

188
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:35,125
You don't remember Thailand
about 4 years ago?

189
00:15:35,228 --> 00:15:37,287
Right before you broke up that bar?

190
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:38,989
About 4 years ago,
my boy had issues.

191
00:15:39,099 --> 00:15:40,430
I mean, his issues had issues.

192
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:43,292
I've been in the military my entire life

193
00:15:43,403 --> 00:15:45,803
and I have never seen
a tac operation like this.

194
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:48,772
All right, you trusted me,
I guess I'll trust you.

195
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:52,003
Technically, G.I. Joe does not exist,
but if it did,

196
00:15:52,112 --> 00:15:54,273
it'd be comprised
of the top men and women

197
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,872
from the best military units in the world,
the alpha dogs.

198
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:01,847
When all else fails, we don't.

199
00:16:03,022 --> 00:16:05,490
10 nations signed on in our first year,

200
00:16:05,592 --> 00:16:08,618
working together, sharing intel.
Now we have 23.

201
00:16:10,997 --> 00:16:12,760
- What's that?
- Camouflage suit.

202
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,868
It photographs everything behind you
and puts it in front of you.

203
00:16:18,071 --> 00:16:21,131
- Mr. McCullen is standing by, sir.
- Patch him through via TelePresence.

204
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:22,936
- So who hit us?
- Currently unknown.

205
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:24,270
But one thing's for sure,

206
00:16:24,377 --> 00:16:26,937
she's got highly classified intel
and state-of-the-art weaponry,

207
00:16:27,046 --> 00:16:28,877
which means there's a whole
hell of a lot of money behind her.

208
00:16:28,982 --> 00:16:31,542
Their capabilities are beyond anything
we've ever encountered.

209
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:34,620
Yeah, that's the one and only reason
why we got our asses kicked out there.

210
00:16:34,721 --> 00:16:37,019
We need to find out
everything we can about her.

211
00:16:37,123 --> 00:16:38,818
Knowing is half the battle.

212
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,255
Gentlemen, Mr. McCullen,

213
00:16:43,696 --> 00:16:47,029
CEO of MARS Industries
and the builder of these warheads.

214
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:49,897
General, clearly you were the
security option I should have chosen.

215
00:16:50,003 --> 00:16:53,769
What did you just say? My team
did everything we could out there,

216
00:16:53,873 --> 00:16:56,740
- and a lot of good men went down.
- Yeah, but not you.

217
00:16:56,843 --> 00:17:00,472
That mission was classified,
so clearly someone sold us out.

218
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,448
I spent 10 years and 13 billion euros
creating these 4 warheads.

219
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:07,213
Your job, Captain, was to protect them,

220
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,948
and if it wasn't for General Hawk,
you'd have failed.

221
00:17:10,056 --> 00:17:13,719
That's not a fair assessment.
He followed his orders to the letter.

222
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:16,192
Well, that wasn't enough.

223
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:19,265
Now, so the bastards who attacked you
can't find you,

224
00:17:19,365 --> 00:17:21,890
you need to disable
the tracking beacon hidden in the case.

225
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:24,902
- We already have.
- Good man.

226
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:28,167
But allow me to check them
to see if any have been damaged.

227
00:17:36,616 --> 00:17:38,208
Open it, please.

228
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,786
My scan says they're intact, sir.

229
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:45,187
- What's the code?
-5-2-9-4-4-0.

230
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:11,881
Please keep me informed
of your progress, General.

231
00:18:16,456 --> 00:18:17,980
Breaker?

232
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:21,891
My voice analyzer on that guy
was going up, down and sideways.

233
00:18:21,995 --> 00:18:25,396
Looks like McCullen's working an angle
he don't want us to catch.

234
00:18:25,698 --> 00:18:28,758
We're on a deadline.
We need those warheads now!

235
00:18:28,868 --> 00:18:31,860
You knew that!
10 years setting this up,

236
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:35,873
wringing money out of NATO,
this was supposed to be the easy part.

237
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:38,842
If you had let me stage the assault
at your precious factory,

238
00:18:38,945 --> 00:18:40,105
I could have contained the situation.

239
00:18:40,213 --> 00:18:42,738
And lost the trust of our clients
in the process.

240
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:44,942
It had to be NATO's fault!

241
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:50,489
What happened?

242
00:18:51,724 --> 00:18:54,318
- Did you hesitate when you saw him?
- No.

243
00:18:54,694 --> 00:18:57,128
This had nothing to do with him.

244
00:18:58,331 --> 00:19:00,060
Forgive my jealousy.

245
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:08,137
Have you tracked the case?

246
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:11,005
They, of course,
deactivated the homing beacon.

247
00:19:11,577 --> 00:19:14,410
I gave them a code
to quietly reactivate it.

248
00:19:15,748 --> 00:19:20,208
It's in Egypt.
The Pit, only mentioned in whispers.

249
00:19:21,321 --> 00:19:23,414
I will get those warheads back.

250
00:19:24,857 --> 00:19:26,347
I hope so.

251
00:19:29,395 --> 00:19:32,626
If I were really there,
I might actually let you touch me.

252
00:19:32,732 --> 00:19:36,259
- I'll send a jet.
- Business first.

253
00:19:36,836 --> 00:19:39,236
Besides, I'm married, remember?

254
00:19:40,573 --> 00:19:44,407
If you had sent me in the first place,
it would already be done.

255
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:49,177
I'm sending you now, Storm Shadow.
No more mistakes.

256
00:19:49,282 --> 00:19:52,251
The schedule mustn't be compromised
any further.

257
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:54,377
Keep your eye on her for me.

258
00:19:54,487 --> 00:19:58,890
American politics,
governors, senators, congressmen.

259
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,720
No wonder nothing ever gets done.

260
00:20:00,827 --> 00:20:03,159
That's what we're going to fix,
Mr. Zartan.

261
00:20:31,391 --> 00:20:34,952
The king cobra, magnificent creature.

262
00:20:35,061 --> 00:20:38,394
Nature's Grim Reaper
and symbol of lethal purpose.

263
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:40,898
Unseen until it strikes.

264
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:44,427
Its venom can kill a full-grown elephant
with a single bite.

265
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:47,734
- Very nice.
- So far we've created 20 Neo-Vipers.

266
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,638
-19 stand before you.
- Is it working?

267
00:20:50,743 --> 00:20:55,874
We injected 1,000 cc of
the nanomite solution into each subject.

268
00:20:55,982 --> 00:20:58,678
When they finally stopped screaming,

269
00:20:58,785 --> 00:21:00,776
brain scans showed
a complete inactivity

270
00:21:00,887 --> 00:21:03,014
of the self-preservation region
of the cortex.

271
00:21:03,122 --> 00:21:04,487
English, Doctor?

272
00:21:07,827 --> 00:21:10,022
They feel no fear.

273
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:17,293
Cortical nerve clusters
show complete inactivity.

274
00:21:18,337 --> 00:21:23,400
They feel no pain.
Concepts of morality are disengaged.

275
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:27,445
They feel no regrets, no remorse.

276
00:21:30,783 --> 00:21:34,378
The nanomites join together
as a fighting mechanism,

277
00:21:34,487 --> 00:21:38,150
first blocking, then expelling
the cobra's venom.

278
00:21:42,662 --> 00:21:44,789
And they're completely obedient?

279
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:48,230
Of course.

280
00:21:49,602 --> 00:21:52,503
The real-world applications are endless.

281
00:21:53,072 --> 00:21:56,769
So, you tell me, is it working?

282
00:21:57,977 --> 00:22:00,946
Send a team to rendezvous
with Storm Shadow and the Baroness.

283
00:22:01,047 --> 00:22:05,313
Consider it done.
The Joes will never know what hit them.

284
00:22:08,754 --> 00:22:11,848
The 20th Neo-Viper is already set up
in Washington, DC

285
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,152
and awaiting your signal.

286
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:16,490
You've done well. You've thrown
the caber clear out of the yard.

287
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:19,497
Construction of the presidential bunker
has also been completed.

288
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:22,067
Now, if we sold one warhead
on the black market,

289
00:22:22,168 --> 00:22:23,430
I could continue my research.

290
00:22:23,536 --> 00:22:25,527
I appreciate your thirst
for knowledge, Doctor,

291
00:22:25,638 --> 00:22:27,936
but this world is messy enough. No.

292
00:22:28,941 --> 00:22:32,570
What it needs is unification, leadership.

293
00:22:33,713 --> 00:22:38,207
It has to be taken out of chaos
by someone with complete control.

294
00:22:40,953 --> 00:22:43,683
Beijing, Moscow, Washington...

295
00:22:44,123 --> 00:22:45,784
When these missiles detonate,

296
00:22:45,892 --> 00:22:48,952
the world will turn
to the most powerful man on the planet.

297
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,829
When I'm finished,
the money will take care of itself.

298
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:56,959
You'll be able to do
all the research you want.

299
00:23:03,242 --> 00:23:06,234
We grabbed this image
from one of our tactical cameras.

300
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:09,109
Now we're running her face
through an infinity scan.

301
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,940
Hey, isn't that...

302
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,579
We have access to any photograph
on any server, anywhere in the world.

303
00:23:16,689 --> 00:23:19,852
Yep. Everyone gets photographed
in some way at some time.

304
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:22,120
Football game, ATM machine, airport...

305
00:23:22,228 --> 00:23:25,356
We'll find her,
and then we'll find out who sent her.

306
00:23:25,464 --> 00:23:27,728
- From NATO, sir.
- Are you okay?

307
00:23:28,734 --> 00:23:30,361
What happened to her?

308
00:23:32,004 --> 00:23:35,770
Well, it appears that I've been made
official custodian of the warheads.

309
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,900
Looks like your mission
is complete here, Duke.

310
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,604
When you move them, she's gonna
come after you. You know that, right?

311
00:23:40,713 --> 00:23:43,375
And with her intel and toys,
she'll find you.

312
00:23:43,482 --> 00:23:44,482
What's your point?

313
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,280
You're going after her first
and we want in.

314
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:50,412
General, it was our team that got wasted
out there. We deserve payback.

315
00:23:50,523 --> 00:23:54,254
You don't ask to be part of G.I. Joe.
You get asked.

316
00:23:55,428 --> 00:23:58,693
You scouted me 4 years ago.
Now I'm ready. Let's have at it.

317
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:00,595
Well, I've lost men, too, Captain.

318
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,327
- If you want revenge...
- I know her.

319
00:24:02,435 --> 00:24:03,435
Excuse me?

320
00:24:03,536 --> 00:24:06,164
You said
knowing's half the battle, right?

321
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:08,206
Well, I know who she is.

322
00:24:08,674 --> 00:24:11,302
She was a blonde.
Her name is Ana Lewis.

323
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,776
I could tell you everything
you need to know about her,

324
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:15,574
up until the last 4 years.

325
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:17,945
After that, obviously,
a lot of things have changed.

326
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,694
Finally, my wife is home.

327
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:47,177
Hello, Daniel. How was your meeting
with the Minister of Defense?

328
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,578
He was thrilled.
The accelerator performed flawlessly.

329
00:24:50,683 --> 00:24:53,015
I wish you would have been there.

330
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:55,383
You and your little lab rats
are so clever.

331
00:24:55,488 --> 00:24:58,116
- How was Monte Carlo?
- I didn't get what I was after.

332
00:24:58,224 --> 00:25:00,920
- I suppose I should be grateful.
- Most husbands would be.

333
00:25:01,027 --> 00:25:03,894
Most husbands don't have
such mysterious wives.

334
00:25:03,996 --> 00:25:06,226
They know exactly where they are
and what they do.

335
00:25:06,332 --> 00:25:07,594
They think they know.

336
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,863
Ana, I don't wanna fight. I missed you.

337
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,302
Well, I never tire of a good fight.

338
00:25:15,207 --> 00:25:19,166
But not with you, darling. Let me
freshen up and I'll meet you downstairs.

339
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:22,338
I do love you, my beautiful Baroness.

340
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:32,753
McCullen gave me orders to kill
the Baron if he so much as touched you.

341
00:25:32,858 --> 00:25:35,691
Well, he's my husband.
Of course he touches me.

342
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:39,196
And besides, his work at the lab goes
much better after we've touched.

343
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:41,232
And that's the important thing.

344
00:25:41,867 --> 00:25:44,097
So what are you doing? Spying on me?

345
00:25:45,137 --> 00:25:48,732
If I was spying on you,
you would never know.

346
00:25:52,244 --> 00:25:53,734
Getting closer.

347
00:25:54,447 --> 00:25:56,415
You were my best student.

348
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,946
I'll be coming with you
to retrieve the warheads.

349
00:26:01,053 --> 00:26:02,520
We go at dawn.

350
00:26:26,045 --> 00:26:27,410
Come on, Ana.

351
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:34,110
Okay, so, I've been wanting to do this
before we deploy.

352
00:26:42,128 --> 00:26:45,495
Duke, it's beautiful. It's too beautiful.

353
00:26:45,598 --> 00:26:48,465
I'm only going to buy one of these,
so why not?

354
00:26:51,237 --> 00:26:52,727
So what do you say?

355
00:26:52,838 --> 00:26:55,636
Say yes, you idiot.
He's a real American hero.

356
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:56,833
Thanks for ruining the mood, Rex.

357
00:26:56,942 --> 00:26:59,274
I apologize. I just came to offer you
a ride back to post.

358
00:26:59,378 --> 00:27:01,107
What? It's time already?

359
00:27:01,213 --> 00:27:04,011
- Yeah, we got to go at 0500.
- Is it...

360
00:27:04,817 --> 00:27:07,445
Yeah, it is, right? That's why
you're pulling Rex out of the lab.

361
00:27:07,553 --> 00:27:11,853
- Ana, look, I'm sorry, but I can't...
- Yeah, yeah, classified, top secret,

362
00:27:11,957 --> 00:27:13,515
you'd have to kill me if you told me,
blah-blah-blah.

363
00:27:13,626 --> 00:27:17,620
And speaking of classified information,
you still haven't answered me.

364
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:22,492
Yes. Yes. Of course it's yes.

365
00:27:23,736 --> 00:27:25,294
On one condition.

366
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:29,439
You have to promise me
that you will not let my genius,

367
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:31,510
egghead brother get hurt.

368
00:27:32,178 --> 00:27:34,510
He's the only family I've got left.

369
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:37,514
Promise me, Duke.

370
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:38,947
I promise.

371
00:27:41,587 --> 00:27:45,023
- Hey! My 3 favorite people.
- Mr. Weems. Good, man?

372
00:27:45,124 --> 00:27:46,352
- Yeah.
- Look.

373
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:50,155
Wow. Nice rock. That's a lot of love.

374
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,827
- Are you proposing?
- I'm actually done proposing.

375
00:27:52,932 --> 00:27:56,368
- I already said yes.
- Oh, my God! Congratulations!

376
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:59,926
Beautiful! You guys are like the little
white couple on the wedding cake.

377
00:28:00,339 --> 00:28:02,432
How cute. Give me some love.

378
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:05,739
Congratulations. Wait. It's not official.

379
00:28:05,845 --> 00:28:07,779
- What?
- It's not official.

380
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,508
- Not until you answer my question.
- Okay.

381
00:28:11,684 --> 00:28:13,345
Do you love my boy?

382
00:28:15,254 --> 00:28:18,052
Always and forever.

383
00:28:22,695 --> 00:28:25,391
You may have blackmailed
your way onto this team.

384
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:27,362
Doesn't mean I've got to like it.

385
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:30,766
But it does mean
I've gotta get you mission ready,

386
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,467
Joe style.

387
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:37,273
Standing in front of you
are Delta-6 Accelerator suits.

388
00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:39,276
- What does it accelerate?
- You.

389
00:28:39,378 --> 00:28:43,314
It'll make you run faster, jump higher
and hit harder than any of your enemies.

390
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:45,180
Let's suit up.

391
00:28:45,284 --> 00:28:49,448
Head-to-toe hydraulics
and highly pressurized pneumatics.

392
00:28:51,757 --> 00:28:54,692
An advanced cybernetics
heads-up display helmet,

393
00:28:54,793 --> 00:28:56,522
which feeds into the suit.

394
00:28:56,629 --> 00:28:58,597
You think it, it does it.

395
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:03,030
Twin gas-propelled grappling spears

396
00:29:03,135 --> 00:29:06,195
and triple-explosive,
heat-seeking, fire-and-forget rockets.

397
00:29:06,305 --> 00:29:07,932
And my personal favorite,

398
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,873
a 10-millimeter caseless
Gatling submachine gun,

399
00:29:10,976 --> 00:29:15,208
capable of firing 50 rounds per second.
Fully self-contained firepower.

400
00:29:15,314 --> 00:29:17,407
Perfect for a couple of cowboys like you.

401
00:29:18,817 --> 00:29:21,513
I just missed everything you said.
Hey, how do I look?

402
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,110
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Any questions?

403
00:29:40,406 --> 00:29:41,566
Yo, Sergeant Stone.

404
00:29:41,674 --> 00:29:44,370
- Are they Joes?
- Hell, no. They're jokes.

405
00:29:44,944 --> 00:29:46,002
Boys.

406
00:29:46,879 --> 00:29:48,403
You're gonna need these.

407
00:29:54,687 --> 00:29:57,656
Just so you know,
when I get a target in my sights,

408
00:29:58,424 --> 00:29:59,914
I take it down.

409
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:01,953
Oh, shit!

410
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,559
- Again.
- Again?

411
00:30:21,847 --> 00:30:25,977
Just so you know, some targets
are harder to hit than others.

412
00:30:31,223 --> 00:30:33,817
- Again.
- You're gonna need that helmet.

413
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,965
Stand down, Snake Eyes.

414
00:30:47,072 --> 00:30:49,040
All right. Walk away. It's over.
This ain't pay-per-view.

415
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:55,344
I'm nasty with it!

416
00:30:55,447 --> 00:30:56,471
You missed one.

417
00:30:56,582 --> 00:30:58,482
Come on. That gotta be
some kind of a record or something.

418
00:30:58,584 --> 00:31:01,212
- The record is all 20 killed.
- Who did that? Let me guess.

419
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,845
- Snake Eyes?
- No. Me.

420
00:31:03,956 --> 00:31:08,017
If you're gonna shoot at something,
kill it. Otherwise, take up knitting.

421
00:31:16,702 --> 00:31:18,397
Beginner's luck. Stay focused.

422
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,775
- Again.
- Again?

423
00:31:33,085 --> 00:31:35,315
I have never seen Snake Eyes take a hit.

424
00:31:35,988 --> 00:31:37,546
They're Joes.

425
00:31:38,991 --> 00:31:40,049
Maybe.

426
00:31:46,665 --> 00:31:47,791
Let's go.

427
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:52,630
Hey, man, Breaker told me that Scarlett
graduated college at 12 years old.

428
00:31:52,971 --> 00:31:55,132
She's like some freaky little
deadly genius.

429
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,606
- Rip. I get it, Rip. You like her.
- Sorry, my bad.

430
00:32:00,913 --> 00:32:04,405
- To hell with it.
- Rip. Rip.

431
00:32:07,086 --> 00:32:09,577
Into the valley of death rode the 600.

432
00:32:09,688 --> 00:32:12,282
Hey, what are you doing?
A little beach reading?

433
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:15,083
Okay.

434
00:32:17,162 --> 00:32:20,859
Look, I think you and me
got off on the wrong foot.

435
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,030
See, I'm attracted to you.
And you, you're attracted to me.

436
00:32:26,472 --> 00:32:28,064
And him, the damn Zen master,

437
00:32:28,173 --> 00:32:30,004
he creeps me out.
What I'm trying to say is...

438
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:32,577
- We're attracted to each other.
- Thank you!

439
00:32:32,678 --> 00:32:35,374
That's what you're saying.
It's not what I'm saying.

440
00:32:36,014 --> 00:32:37,174
It's not?

441
00:32:38,317 --> 00:32:40,012
So, what are you saying?

442
00:32:43,055 --> 00:32:46,582
Attraction is an emotion.
Emotions are not based in science.

443
00:32:46,692 --> 00:32:50,492
And if you can't quantify
or prove that something exists, well,

444
00:32:50,596 --> 00:32:52,496
in my mind, it doesn't.

445
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:56,259
Okay. I'll get back to you on that one.

446
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:59,403
Attention! General on deck!

447
00:32:59,505 --> 00:33:01,905
At ease. Duke,

448
00:33:02,007 --> 00:33:05,499
you scored in the top half percent
of all people we've ever tested.

449
00:33:06,145 --> 00:33:09,842
Rip, if we average your scores
with Duke's, you pass, too.

450
00:33:10,315 --> 00:33:11,714
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you, sir.

451
00:33:11,817 --> 00:33:14,149
- Provisionally, of course.
- Thank you, sir.

452
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:37,002
Sir, sensors detecting seismic activity
to the southwest.

453
00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:38,804
Probably just a tremor,
but have a team check it.

454
00:34:27,226 --> 00:34:29,057
There's our little weapons case.

455
00:34:29,161 --> 00:34:32,130
All right. You 3, guard the machines.

456
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:02,754
- Sorry to disturb you, sir.
- That's all right, Corporal.

457
00:35:02,861 --> 00:35:06,661
I need you to sign here, here and here.
And also here, here...

458
00:35:18,143 --> 00:35:19,838
Goodbye, sweetheart.

459
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,710
That's right. You don't kill women.

460
00:35:27,819 --> 00:35:30,344
For you, Zartan, I'd make an exception.

461
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:00,342
Warheads, Rip! Come on!

462
00:36:05,657 --> 00:36:06,783
Go, go!

463
00:36:10,896 --> 00:36:13,330
We've got the warheads.
Prep the Mole Pods for evac.

464
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:15,559
- We're on our way.
- We're already on it.

465
00:36:32,284 --> 00:36:34,514
- Now how do we get out of here?
- Follow me.

466
00:36:36,855 --> 00:36:38,652
Like that's gonna happen.

467
00:36:49,534 --> 00:36:51,729
Find the control room.
Open the exterior hatch.

468
00:36:51,837 --> 00:36:53,771
- And secure this area.
- We're on it.

469
00:36:58,744 --> 00:36:59,836
Clear.

470
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:11,781
Go, go!

471
00:37:14,726 --> 00:37:18,162
- Can you fly one of these things?
- Don't move! Ana, put the case down.

472
00:37:18,897 --> 00:37:21,365
Fine. Done.

473
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:25,937
Stop. Ana, stop right there.

474
00:37:26,037 --> 00:37:28,597
- You can't shoot me, can you?
- I will if I have to.

475
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:31,403
Deep down, you're still the same man
I fell in love with.

476
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:35,071
- Don't force this.
- What could have been. Right, Duke?

477
00:37:36,148 --> 00:37:38,480
Just give me the case, God damn it.

478
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:43,646
- Move and I'm gonna blow her away.
- Do it. You already killed me once.

479
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:45,751
Duke, watch out!

480
00:37:58,336 --> 00:37:59,428
Ana, drop the case!

481
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:15,145
Hello, brother.

482
00:38:41,847 --> 00:38:42,905
Damn!

483
00:38:47,853 --> 00:38:49,115
Eat this!

484
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:14,542
Hey, genius!

485
00:40:28,587 --> 00:40:29,918
See you, Duke.

486
00:40:58,817 --> 00:41:01,786
- How many warheads?
-4, Mr. President.

487
00:41:01,886 --> 00:41:05,049
- Any threats? Demands?
- None so far, sir.

488
00:41:05,156 --> 00:41:07,124
We take this to mean
the terrorists are unfocused.

489
00:41:07,225 --> 00:41:09,125
- No clear goals.
- No.

490
00:41:10,595 --> 00:41:12,586
It means they intend to use them.

491
00:41:13,832 --> 00:41:15,356
General Hawk is stable now,

492
00:41:15,467 --> 00:41:17,799
but he won't be conscious
for another day or so.

493
00:41:17,902 --> 00:41:19,631
He's one tough bastard.

494
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:32,875
Hey.

495
00:41:35,987 --> 00:41:37,750
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

496
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,323
- I didn't want anyone to see me like this.
- Why?

497
00:41:42,527 --> 00:41:44,586
I don't know. All the men we lost,
General Hawk wounded,

498
00:41:44,696 --> 00:41:46,323
my neck just doesn't seem important.

499
00:41:46,431 --> 00:41:50,424
You almost lost your life out there.
You have a reason to be concerned.

500
00:41:52,737 --> 00:41:54,830
First fight I lost since I was a kid.

501
00:41:56,641 --> 00:41:58,666
My father taught me to win.

502
00:41:58,777 --> 00:42:04,443
Look, I don't see how you could teach
anybody to win everything every time.

503
00:42:06,484 --> 00:42:07,917
I mean, look at you.

504
00:42:08,386 --> 00:42:09,876
You're still here, right?

505
00:42:10,355 --> 00:42:12,721
You get knocked down, you get back up.

506
00:42:12,857 --> 00:42:14,984
Maybe that's
what he wanted you to learn.

507
00:42:17,495 --> 00:42:20,396
But then again,
that would be an emotional response,

508
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:23,160
one that can't be explained or quantified.

509
00:42:40,185 --> 00:42:43,416
Hey. Looks like we're all
seeing ghosts today, huh?

510
00:44:21,916 --> 00:44:23,315
Storm Shadow!

511
00:44:27,288 --> 00:44:30,416
English, Storm Shadow.
Where are your manners?

512
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:32,224
He is hungry.

513
00:44:32,626 --> 00:44:36,653
We need to invite him in
and show him the path.

514
00:44:37,131 --> 00:44:41,124
- He is a cur, a weakling!
- He does not fight like one.

515
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,038
Now, what shall we call you?

516
00:44:55,316 --> 00:44:57,614
This belonged to an ancestor of mine.

517
00:44:58,385 --> 00:45:00,785
He was caught selling arms
to both sides.

518
00:45:00,888 --> 00:45:04,085
The French forced him to wear it
for the rest of his life.

519
00:45:04,191 --> 00:45:07,683
They called him Destro,
destroyer of nations.

520
00:45:08,229 --> 00:45:09,662
So why do you keep it?

521
00:45:09,763 --> 00:45:12,425
So that I never forget
the most important rule in dealing arms.

522
00:45:12,533 --> 00:45:15,093
Let me guess. Never sell to both sides?

523
00:45:15,202 --> 00:45:17,670
Never get caught selling to both sides.

524
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:22,972
Take the warheads to Paris.
Have them weaponized.

525
00:45:23,077 --> 00:45:25,204
- Then I want you to test one.
- Test one?

526
00:45:25,312 --> 00:45:28,008
We'll let CNN show the world
how well they perform.

527
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,509
Fear is a great motivator.

528
00:45:34,922 --> 00:45:39,018
I have a target in mind,
one the French will never forget,

529
00:45:39,894 --> 00:45:43,193
as I've never forgotten
what they did to Clan McCullen.

530
00:45:53,107 --> 00:45:56,042
- Are you ready, Mr. Zartan?
- Born ready, Doctor.

531
00:45:56,143 --> 00:45:58,111
This is going to be
the achievement of a lifetime.

532
00:45:58,212 --> 00:46:01,181
Yes, as a master of disguise,
you have no equal, my friend.

533
00:46:01,282 --> 00:46:05,218
18 months of studying my target,
learning mannerisms,

534
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:07,116
but the devil is in the details.

535
00:46:07,221 --> 00:46:09,985
Gentlemen, let's get it going.

536
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,284
One more thing.

537
00:46:11,392 --> 00:46:13,986
I'll control my own brain,
thank you very much.

538
00:46:17,464 --> 00:46:18,795
Let's do this.

539
00:46:37,685 --> 00:46:41,212
- Wow. That was a bit nasty.
- Think so?

540
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:44,150
Let's run some tests.

541
00:46:45,793 --> 00:46:51,789
Eye color. Skin tone. Hair follicles.

542
00:46:52,299 --> 00:46:56,133
And initiating facial reconstruction tests.

543
00:47:06,814 --> 00:47:08,509
We gotta find out
who's holding their leash.

544
00:47:08,615 --> 00:47:12,073
With their weaponry, financing
and intel, these guys are high-line pros.

545
00:47:12,186 --> 00:47:13,881
That limits the possibilities.

546
00:47:13,988 --> 00:47:17,287
- Hey, the weapons case.
- What?

547
00:47:17,391 --> 00:47:18,983
Remember, McCullen had us
open the weapons case?

548
00:47:19,093 --> 00:47:20,788
- What about it?
- I bet you he gave us a code

549
00:47:20,894 --> 00:47:23,055
that reactivated the tracking beacon.

550
00:47:23,163 --> 00:47:26,655
You're right.
McCullen, that son of a bitch.

551
00:47:26,767 --> 00:47:29,133
So, McCullen uses NATO
to fund his R&D

552
00:47:29,236 --> 00:47:30,897
and then he steals the warheads back.

553
00:47:31,005 --> 00:47:35,669
- And who says you're not a thinker?
- Hey, I found her.

554
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,175
Yeah, that's her all right.

555
00:47:38,278 --> 00:47:42,180
Her name is Ana de Cobray.
Baroness, if you're feeling formal.

556
00:47:42,282 --> 00:47:45,809
Baroness? Wow, she really traded up.
Financially, of course.

557
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,978
- Who's he?
- Daniel de Cobray.

558
00:47:48,088 --> 00:47:50,818
Big shot French scientist.
Runs a lab in Paris.

559
00:47:50,924 --> 00:47:53,859
- Lab? What kind of lab?
- Particle accelerator.

560
00:47:55,129 --> 00:47:58,530
Oh, my God. They're going to use him
to weaponize the warheads.

561
00:47:59,433 --> 00:48:01,424
Well, that's where she's going.

562
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,695
I like croissants.

563
00:48:34,401 --> 00:48:37,131
- Go, go, go!
- Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

564
00:48:37,337 --> 00:48:38,827
Pull up on the truck!

565
00:48:42,509 --> 00:48:43,942
Go, go, go!

566
00:48:45,045 --> 00:48:48,139
-2 o'clock!
- Go, go, go!

567
00:48:48,248 --> 00:48:49,579
Go, let's move!

568
00:48:52,686 --> 00:48:55,314
- In the alley!
- Get down, get down!

569
00:48:55,422 --> 00:48:56,719
You see them?

570
00:48:59,059 --> 00:49:02,119
-2 more on the left!
- Get down!

571
00:49:02,229 --> 00:49:04,697
Dubble Bubble? It always helps me.

572
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,960
Yeah. Hey, you good?

573
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:11,101
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

574
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,802
All right, Mr. Science Officer,
you're up, okay?

575
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:17,809
You don't find it in 4 minutes,
you get out of there.

576
00:49:17,911 --> 00:49:21,904
That house will not be there in 5.
I already called for the air strike.

577
00:49:22,015 --> 00:49:23,346
Come on! Here we go!

578
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,985
I got you! Go, go, go!

579
00:49:30,057 --> 00:49:31,718
Oh, crap!

580
00:49:35,028 --> 00:49:36,222
Rooftop!

581
00:49:39,399 --> 00:49:41,060
Hey, Duke, I gotta level with you.

582
00:49:41,168 --> 00:49:44,501
- I hate it when you level with me.
- It's going to be a long 5 minutes.

583
00:49:50,244 --> 00:49:53,441
No, no, no! It's too early. It's too early!

584
00:49:54,114 --> 00:49:56,742
- Duke!
- Rex! Rex!

585
00:50:16,803 --> 00:50:17,929
Rex.

586
00:50:21,909 --> 00:50:23,843
Duke! Come on. We gotta go.

587
00:50:23,944 --> 00:50:25,434
- I gotta get Rex.
- We gotta go, man!

588
00:50:25,546 --> 00:50:28,344
Black Hawk's waiting! We gotta go!
Nothing you can do!

589
00:50:28,448 --> 00:50:30,416
- Nothing you can do, man! Come on!
- I gotta get Rex.

590
00:50:35,455 --> 00:50:38,049
Ready. Aim. Fire.

591
00:50:38,926 --> 00:50:40,553
Forward, march.

592
00:51:33,847 --> 00:51:35,974
Are you going to sign in or shall I?

593
00:52:00,407 --> 00:52:01,465
Ana?

594
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:04,638
Who is this?

595
00:52:05,345 --> 00:52:06,812
Hey! What are you doing?

596
00:52:06,913 --> 00:52:08,847
- What's going on here?
- I need you to do something for me

597
00:52:08,949 --> 00:52:10,780
and I don't have much time.

598
00:52:11,485 --> 00:52:13,214
What are these things?

599
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,719
They're warheads, dear.

600
00:52:14,821 --> 00:52:18,484
And I need you to weaponize them
for me, or we'll kill everyone in here.

601
00:52:20,527 --> 00:52:23,291
Hey! This is a civilian laboratory!

602
00:52:23,997 --> 00:52:26,693
We don't have the correct
programming protocols for weaponizing!

603
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,896
The protocols are in the case.
I told you, I don't have much time.

604
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:44,947
Hey, is that Dubble Bubble?

605
00:52:45,552 --> 00:52:46,712
But it's my last piece.

606
00:52:47,621 --> 00:52:50,317
- Come on, give it to me.
- All right, there you go.

607
00:52:50,424 --> 00:52:53,359
All right. Stick to the plan.
Scarlett, Snake Eyes, take the front.

608
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,951
Rip, Duke, take the back.
Breaker will be our eyes and ears.

609
00:52:56,063 --> 00:52:57,291
I'll give the orders from here.

610
00:52:57,397 --> 00:53:00,161
- You do what I say, when I say. Got it?
- Yes, Daddy.

611
00:53:48,749 --> 00:53:49,943
Here.

612
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:52,777
- They're all alive.
- Merci, Daniel.

613
00:54:10,303 --> 00:54:13,204
I told you I'd kill him
if he touched you again.

614
00:54:13,573 --> 00:54:15,564
I heard you the first time.

615
00:54:21,248 --> 00:54:24,179
Okay, we're almost there.
Scarlett, you better put your suit on.

616
00:54:34,428 --> 00:54:35,725
That's her.

617
00:54:42,836 --> 00:54:44,599
Take that Hummer, Snake!

618
00:55:09,129 --> 00:55:11,188
Careful.
They're worth millions of dollars each.

619
00:55:11,298 --> 00:55:12,925
Millions of dollars. Got it.

620
00:55:14,267 --> 00:55:17,862
- Jesus.
- My bad. My bad. Won't happen again!

621
00:55:21,374 --> 00:55:22,773
Thanks a lot, buddy!

622
00:55:23,176 --> 00:55:26,668
Come on, Scarlett, babe. You in or out?
We gotta get in this fight!

623
00:55:38,325 --> 00:55:41,624
Tracking signal is good.
Don't let go of that truck, Snake Eyes.

624
00:56:14,794 --> 00:56:16,489
Let's get that bastard off the roof.

625
00:56:45,659 --> 00:56:46,956
Look out!

626
00:56:50,363 --> 00:56:51,921
Hey, Heavy, it's getting thick out here!

627
00:56:52,032 --> 00:56:54,432
Yeah, I know. They're driving
right into the heaviest traffic.

628
00:56:54,534 --> 00:56:56,058
What kind of escape route is that?

629
00:56:56,169 --> 00:56:59,161
Maybe they're not trying to escape.
Maybe they're heading somewhere.

630
00:56:59,272 --> 00:57:01,069
- Possible target?
- Yes.

631
00:57:03,577 --> 00:57:07,240
Some place with a lot of metal.

632
00:57:10,717 --> 00:57:14,619
- They're going to blow it up. All units!
- Guys, you have to stop them!

633
00:57:14,721 --> 00:57:16,120
Yeah, we're working on it.

634
00:57:16,323 --> 00:57:17,323
I mean right now!

635
00:57:17,424 --> 00:57:20,188
They're going to detonate one
of the warheads on the Eiffel Tower!

636
00:57:54,027 --> 00:57:55,153
Crush him!

637
00:57:56,363 --> 00:57:57,523
Snake!

638
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:04,962
He's underneath. Kill him!

639
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:19,718
That redhead is really starting
to piss me off.

640
00:58:23,356 --> 00:58:24,380
Shit!

641
00:58:25,492 --> 00:58:26,686
Oh, God!

642
00:58:28,261 --> 00:58:30,024
I got you. I got you.

643
00:58:31,464 --> 00:58:32,488
- Nice save, slick.
- Come on,

644
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:35,159
don't start being all nice to me now.
Gotta go.

645
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:40,999
Get in!

646
00:58:45,011 --> 00:58:47,980
All right, Rip, let's take this thing down!
Hang on, Snake!

647
00:58:56,890 --> 00:58:59,085
Try this on for size, boys.

648
00:59:13,973 --> 00:59:15,133
Oh, shit!

649
00:59:33,993 --> 00:59:35,517
We lost them!

650
00:59:35,829 --> 00:59:37,387
Cut through that building
across the street.

651
00:59:37,497 --> 00:59:39,089
- Where's the door?
- Make one!

652
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:40,826
Right! Come on, Rip!

653
00:59:41,935 --> 00:59:43,698
I'm coming. I'm coming!

654
00:59:44,971 --> 00:59:46,939
I don't have them! Where are they?

655
01:00:09,262 --> 01:00:11,856
- They're evacuating the Tower.
- We're only 2 kilometers away.

656
01:00:11,965 --> 01:00:14,058
Snake, we're running out of time.
You gotta do something.

657
01:00:14,167 --> 01:00:15,464
It's now or never.

658
01:00:25,011 --> 01:00:28,003
- He gave up.
- He never gives up.

659
01:00:40,994 --> 01:00:42,188
Coming through!

660
01:01:04,083 --> 01:01:06,517
Okay, that was crazy.
I didn't expect that.

661
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:10,054
- What happened to you?
- I went through the train.

662
01:01:10,156 --> 01:01:12,624
- What happened to you?
- I jumped over it.

663
01:01:13,059 --> 01:01:16,085
- You can do that?
- Yeah. I told you to read that manual.

664
01:01:16,196 --> 01:01:17,629
There's a manual?

665
01:01:21,768 --> 01:01:24,236
Next time, I'll drive.

666
01:01:37,283 --> 01:01:39,513
Here. Take the kill switch.

667
01:01:49,829 --> 01:01:51,387
Come on. Get out of the way!

668
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,161
Hey, guys, they're alive
and they're on the move.

669
01:01:56,269 --> 01:01:59,534
And they've activated the warhead.
I'm tracking the kill switch now.

670
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,234
Duke! Duke, it's on the Baroness!

671
01:02:02,342 --> 01:02:04,867
Storm Shadow has one of the warheads,
and it's armed!

672
01:02:15,688 --> 01:02:18,316
Get out of my way! Get out!

673
01:02:19,325 --> 01:02:20,758
Get out!

674
01:02:22,028 --> 01:02:23,052
Nice shoes.

675
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,398
You get the warhead,
I'll get the kill switch.

676
01:02:35,508 --> 01:02:36,736
Yeah, I'm on it.

677
01:02:59,766 --> 01:03:01,427
Damn, that ninja's fast!

678
01:03:04,904 --> 01:03:05,928
No.

679
01:03:30,897 --> 01:03:32,125
Oh, no!

680
01:03:44,877 --> 01:03:47,038
- Bloody hell.
- No.

681
01:04:08,434 --> 01:04:09,799
They're gonna eat through
the entire city.

682
01:04:09,902 --> 01:04:11,665
Duke, you have to hit that kill switch!

683
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:45,731
Oh, God.

684
01:05:08,528 --> 01:05:09,620
Disarmed.

685
01:05:23,209 --> 01:05:25,643
Congratulations, Duke.
You just saved Paris.

686
01:05:28,548 --> 01:05:30,072
Or at least most of it.

687
01:06:00,046 --> 01:06:03,174
- Is that blood?
- Spaghetti sauce. Don't ask.

688
01:06:04,117 --> 01:06:05,982
- They got Duke.
- We know.

689
01:06:06,385 --> 01:06:08,876
- What are you doing?
- Plugging into his cerebral cortex.

690
01:06:08,988 --> 01:06:10,012
I hate to break the news to you,

691
01:06:10,123 --> 01:06:12,387
but I don't think he's gonna
give you much in his dead condition.

692
01:06:12,492 --> 01:06:14,357
The brain survives
a couple of minutes after death.

693
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:17,088
We can retrieve the electrical impulses
from his most recent memories

694
01:06:17,196 --> 01:06:19,289
- and convert them to images.
- Well, can we find Duke?

695
01:06:19,398 --> 01:06:20,956
We need to find
the other 3 warheads first.

696
01:06:21,067 --> 01:06:24,230
If this guy remembers his way home,
maybe we can find both.

697
01:06:25,071 --> 01:06:28,268
Okay, here come the images.
Let's see where this guy's been.

698
01:06:33,846 --> 01:06:34,870
- He's still alive!
- He can't be.

699
01:06:34,981 --> 01:06:36,039
He's got 3-inch needles in his head!

700
01:06:36,149 --> 01:06:39,243
- Hey, dead guys don't breakdance!
- What's happening, Breaker?

701
01:06:39,352 --> 01:06:42,150
- Nanomites, they're eating him.
- Must be some sort of self-destruct.

702
01:06:42,255 --> 01:06:44,780
- Hurry, Breaker!
- Come on, come on, come on.

703
01:06:46,392 --> 01:06:48,326
No. No!

704
01:06:50,496 --> 01:06:51,895
No, no, no!

705
01:06:53,633 --> 01:06:56,101
The beauty of nanotechnology.

706
01:06:57,770 --> 01:06:59,965
- We are screwed.
- Relax. I got everything I could.

707
01:07:00,072 --> 01:07:02,199
What? Then what the hell was the,
"No, no, no, no!" for?

708
01:07:02,308 --> 01:07:03,468
That was for McCullen.

709
01:07:03,576 --> 01:07:06,272
- They were watching us.
- Okay. So what did you get?

710
01:07:06,379 --> 01:07:07,744
Actually, not that much. Just images.

711
01:07:07,847 --> 01:07:09,747
Come on, Frenchie. I thought you said
you was the best at this.

712
01:07:09,849 --> 01:07:11,146
- I am the best at this!
- All right.

713
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:12,774
- Nobody can do what I just did.
- Okay.

714
01:07:15,388 --> 01:07:16,753
Wait, no.

715
01:07:17,256 --> 01:07:19,121
We didn't do it. We're the good guys.

716
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:22,589
- Put your hands up, Rip.
- We don't have time for this!

717
01:07:22,695 --> 01:07:24,424
We're not allowed to engage
with friendly forces.

718
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:27,431
They don't look too friendly to me.
I gotta get my boy.

719
01:07:27,533 --> 01:07:29,398
- Look, Captain...
- Rip!

720
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,790
We're still trying to locate
the 3 remaining warheads, sir.

721
01:07:56,896 --> 01:07:59,694
- What's the status of the Joes?
- They've been detained.

722
01:07:59,799 --> 01:08:03,257
- The French are pretty upset.
- Of course they're upset.

723
01:08:04,971 --> 01:08:06,404
Get me the French Ambassador.

724
01:08:14,947 --> 01:08:17,745
...in a matter of seconds
by a strike by a missile...

725
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:19,181
Hey, no, no!

726
01:08:20,453 --> 01:08:23,479
Please don't touch that!
That's my equipment. It's very...

727
01:08:24,757 --> 01:08:26,384
Okay, he's touching it.

728
01:08:27,693 --> 01:08:29,786
- Nice going, slick.
- It's not his fault.

729
01:08:29,895 --> 01:08:31,988
He's just emotional.

730
01:08:32,565 --> 01:08:34,658
- Here, let me look at that.
- I'm fine.

731
01:08:34,767 --> 01:08:37,133
Just trying to help. General!

732
01:08:42,108 --> 01:08:47,808
The French have agreed to let you all go
on the condition that none of you return.

733
01:08:48,981 --> 01:08:50,005
Ever.

734
01:08:50,116 --> 01:08:52,277
- Never?
- It could be worse.

735
01:08:52,385 --> 01:08:54,012
What do you mean by never?
Like, never, never, ever?

736
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,587
There's more.

737
01:08:55,688 --> 01:08:59,249
All of you have been recalled
by your respective heads of state.

738
01:08:59,358 --> 01:09:01,758
Team Alpha is to return to the Pit.

739
01:09:03,129 --> 01:09:04,687
What about Duke?

740
01:09:11,604 --> 01:09:13,902
Call McCullen.
Tell him we have the 3 warheads.

741
01:09:14,006 --> 01:09:15,234
Right away.

742
01:09:17,777 --> 01:09:19,745
Why didn't you just kill me?

743
01:09:19,845 --> 01:09:22,712
McCullen has something special
in mind for you.

744
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,009
McCullen.

745
01:09:26,152 --> 01:09:27,676
What happened to you?

746
01:09:27,787 --> 01:09:29,152
Now you care?

747
01:09:30,556 --> 01:09:31,614
Okay.

748
01:09:32,992 --> 01:09:34,357
I am sorry.

749
01:09:35,561 --> 01:09:37,529
I'm sorry about Rex.

750
01:09:38,264 --> 01:09:40,858
I'm sorry that I couldn't bring Rex home.

751
01:09:41,801 --> 01:09:44,770
And I'm so sorry
that I couldn't face you afterwards.

752
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:48,604
Well, everybody's sorry
about something.

753
01:10:56,342 --> 01:10:57,707
Master!

754
01:10:58,277 --> 01:10:59,471
Master.

755
01:11:21,167 --> 01:11:23,431
Okay, so what about Duke?
We're just gonna forget about him?

756
01:11:23,536 --> 01:11:24,730
We've got our orders.

757
01:11:24,837 --> 01:11:26,771
Look, man,
what if it was one of your guys?

758
01:11:26,872 --> 01:11:29,363
What if it was Scarlett or Breaker?
What would you do then?

759
01:11:29,475 --> 01:11:31,841
Looks pretty remote.
Might be a good location for a base.

760
01:11:31,944 --> 01:11:34,708
Snow. That leaves us with what,
1/3 of the earth?

761
01:11:34,814 --> 01:11:35,974
Yeah.

762
01:11:38,184 --> 01:11:40,516
- Hey, is that McCullen's shadow?
- What you got?

763
01:11:40,619 --> 01:11:42,985
- Spherical trigonometry.
- I must have missed that class.

764
01:11:43,088 --> 01:11:45,056
If you know the height of the object,
the length of the shadow,

765
01:11:45,157 --> 01:11:46,590
and the time and date
that the image was captured,

766
01:11:46,692 --> 01:11:48,887
- you can figure out its location.
- That's why I missed that class.

767
01:11:48,994 --> 01:11:50,757
All right, Breaker, give it to me.
What have we got?

768
01:11:50,863 --> 01:11:56,062
Okay. McCullen is 180 centimeters tall.
His shadow is 46 centimeters.

769
01:11:56,168 --> 01:11:57,897
This image has decayed 6%,

770
01:11:58,003 --> 01:12:01,370
which means
it's 51 hours and 17 minutes old.

771
01:12:01,907 --> 01:12:03,738
That's at the polar icecap.

772
01:12:03,843 --> 01:12:05,367
- Heavy.
- Yep.

773
01:12:07,112 --> 01:12:08,112
What do you say, sir?

774
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:10,444
I said you've been ordered back
to the Pit,

775
01:12:11,584 --> 01:12:14,747
but I didn't say when
and I didn't say which route to take.

776
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:19,380
Maybe a northern one.

777
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:38,267
That is a lot of ice.

778
01:12:38,377 --> 01:12:40,709
Thousands of miles across
and 10 stories thick.

779
01:12:40,813 --> 01:12:43,748
Locating McCullen's base will be
like finding a needle in a coal mine.

780
01:12:43,849 --> 01:12:45,874
- Haystack.
- Right.

781
01:12:46,352 --> 01:12:48,013
Haystack in a coal mine.

782
01:13:36,969 --> 01:13:39,028
No! McCullen has plans for him!

783
01:13:46,312 --> 01:13:47,506
Enough!

784
01:14:01,594 --> 01:14:03,118
And what was your plan?

785
01:14:03,729 --> 01:14:06,163
Run 3,000 miles across the ice?

786
01:14:11,370 --> 01:14:12,860
Stupid soldier.

787
01:14:21,347 --> 01:14:22,746
Move it.

788
01:14:23,215 --> 01:14:25,080
- That's strange.
- What?

789
01:14:25,417 --> 01:14:28,113
When they stole the weapons case,
I set my scanner

790
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:31,485
to look out for the tracking beacon
in case it came back on.

791
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:34,354
- And it just came back on.
- That's my boy!

792
01:14:55,447 --> 01:14:56,471
3 left.

793
01:14:56,582 --> 01:15:00,348
Take the warheads to the missiles.
I want them ready to launch in one hour.

794
01:15:00,586 --> 01:15:02,110
It will be done.

795
01:15:10,329 --> 01:15:12,297
My beautiful Lady of the Lake.

796
01:15:20,873 --> 01:15:22,465
This bother you?

797
01:15:24,143 --> 01:15:28,273
It's funny, isn't it? The entire balance
of power in the world about to shift,

798
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:31,781
2 guys can still have a stare-down
over who gets the girl.

799
01:15:49,301 --> 01:15:51,428
I'm gonna make you very unhappy.

800
01:15:51,537 --> 01:15:53,505
- I'm already unhappy.
- Get up!

801
01:16:05,851 --> 01:16:08,445
Video from the Aqua Cam
is coming online now.

802
01:16:08,987 --> 01:16:10,420
Bloody hell.

803
01:16:10,756 --> 01:16:13,782
They've built a military base
under the polar icecap.

804
01:16:13,892 --> 01:16:16,793
It's the perfect location.
Nearly undetectable, easily defensible.

805
01:16:16,895 --> 01:16:19,455
- Duke's got to be in there somewhere.
- And the warheads.

806
01:16:19,565 --> 01:16:21,658
We have to find a quiet way
to get inside.

807
01:16:24,169 --> 01:16:26,933
Elevator cables.
They've got a surface entrance.

808
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:31,271
Guys, there's something else.
Going to sonar view.

809
01:16:31,977 --> 01:16:34,275
They've got tunnels
running through the ice pack.

810
01:16:34,379 --> 01:16:36,643
Hey, look, they've got
their own attack subs.

811
01:16:36,749 --> 01:16:38,239
Okay, what's that?

812
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:41,012
- Missile tubes.
- Must be for the nanomite warheads.

813
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:44,385
Take us up. I'll create a distraction
from outside and keep them busy

814
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:47,084
while you lot infiltrate the facility
from above. We'll find Duke...

815
01:16:47,192 --> 01:16:48,716
- Grab the warheads.
- Kill all the bad guys.

816
01:16:49,628 --> 01:16:52,825
As you all know,
Team Alpha is under direct orders

817
01:16:52,931 --> 01:16:55,365
to return to their
respective national bases.

818
01:16:55,467 --> 01:16:59,494
But I have something I need to do
which goes against all orders.

819
01:17:00,472 --> 01:17:03,202
So, if any of you decide
that you have to leave now,

820
01:17:03,308 --> 01:17:06,072
I will certainly not hold it against you.

821
01:17:16,088 --> 01:17:17,112
Okay, then.

822
01:17:18,323 --> 01:17:19,483
What are you gonna do
with the warheads?

823
01:17:19,591 --> 01:17:22,287
You take to your training well.
That's good.

824
01:17:22,394 --> 01:17:24,157
Still trying to develop intel.

825
01:17:24,263 --> 01:17:26,458
- So you won't mind telling me.
- Isn't it obvious?

826
01:17:26,565 --> 01:17:28,760
I'm a businessman.
I'm going to use them.

827
01:17:28,867 --> 01:17:31,329
Millions of people are gonna die
if you launch those warheads,

828
01:17:31,436 --> 01:17:32,460
so what is it that you want?

829
01:17:32,571 --> 01:17:36,701
To strike fear into the hearts of every
man, woman and child on the planet.

830
01:17:37,376 --> 01:17:39,606
Then they'll turn to the person
with the most power.

831
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,769
You?

832
01:17:41,446 --> 01:17:42,936
No, not me.

833
01:17:43,048 --> 01:17:45,209
- You're not seeing the whole picture.
- Then tell me.

834
01:17:45,317 --> 01:17:47,342
I don't wanna spoil the surprise.

835
01:17:57,763 --> 01:17:58,763
Guests.

836
01:17:58,864 --> 01:18:01,697
Meet the genius
behind all my nanotechnology.

837
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,530
Genius? You are too kind.

838
01:18:05,003 --> 01:18:08,131
As you can see,
we are loading my nanomite warheads

839
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,071
into the high-V missiles.

840
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:12,905
Once at maximum velocity, Mach 5,

841
01:18:13,278 --> 01:18:16,475
not even the Joes have
the technology to catch them.

842
01:18:16,582 --> 01:18:19,676
So, who's this? Another recruit?

843
01:18:20,686 --> 01:18:22,677
Albeit a rather unwilling one.

844
01:18:22,788 --> 01:18:25,222
I'll prepare him for the procedure.

845
01:18:46,445 --> 01:18:49,073
All teams, listen up,
this is General Hawk.

846
01:18:49,181 --> 01:18:52,275
The mission is a go.
I say again, the mission is a go.

847
01:18:52,985 --> 01:18:53,985
Good luck, Joes.

848
01:19:24,316 --> 01:19:26,876
- The teams have been deployed, sir.
- Get me a satellite uplink.

849
01:19:26,985 --> 01:19:29,453
I wanna see everything
that's going on down there.

850
01:19:42,301 --> 01:19:43,461
You picking up anything?

851
01:19:43,568 --> 01:19:45,934
Negative.
There's nothing on the scanner.

852
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:00,279
- Nice shooting.
- Thank you.

853
01:20:02,187 --> 01:20:03,916
We're a long way from Miami.

854
01:20:05,357 --> 01:20:08,190
That's a Night Raven.
They actually built one.

855
01:20:08,293 --> 01:20:10,853
Looks fast.
That McCullen got some gadgets.

856
01:20:12,264 --> 01:20:17,702
MARS Industries manufactures
70% of all arms on this planet.

857
01:20:18,103 --> 01:20:19,798
70%.

858
01:20:20,872 --> 01:20:23,898
Did you know that, Duke?

859
01:20:24,509 --> 01:20:29,310
There are 2 sides to McCullen's operation,
the Sword and the Shield.

860
01:20:29,681 --> 01:20:32,149
The Sword creates and sells weaponry.

861
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:36,653
The Shield creates defensive
technology, like high-tech bunkers,

862
01:20:36,755 --> 01:20:38,814
which are supposed
to protect one from anything

863
01:20:38,924 --> 01:20:41,825
from a nuclear blast
to a nanomite warhead.

864
01:20:41,927 --> 01:20:46,159
Unfortunately, the bunker
in which I took shelter

865
01:20:46,264 --> 01:20:47,959
was just a prototype.

866
01:20:48,066 --> 01:20:49,499
Who are you?

867
01:21:02,214 --> 01:21:03,442
Rex?

868
01:21:04,549 --> 01:21:07,143
You son of a bitch! Ana buried you!

869
01:21:07,252 --> 01:21:09,686
Moving ceremony, I'm sure.

870
01:21:09,788 --> 01:21:11,847
The 3-volley salute.

871
01:21:11,957 --> 01:21:14,949
Boots on the ground.
A folded flag in her arms.

872
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:17,494
Why? Why didn't you just come in?

873
01:21:17,596 --> 01:21:20,531
Because I discovered something.

874
01:21:23,735 --> 01:21:26,067
...subject number 23.

875
01:21:27,939 --> 01:21:29,839
This will only hurt a little.

876
01:21:29,941 --> 01:21:32,341
What comes next, more so.

877
01:21:32,444 --> 01:21:34,912
Listen, Mindbender,
do whatever it takes.

878
01:21:35,013 --> 01:21:36,480
So will I.

879
01:21:36,581 --> 01:21:39,846
Remember, science requires sacrifice.

880
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:43,587
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Stay where you are!

881
01:21:45,023 --> 01:21:46,786
Are you going to shoot me?

882
01:21:49,127 --> 01:21:52,028
These aren't chemical or nuclear,
are they?

883
01:21:52,130 --> 01:21:53,290
No.

884
01:21:53,398 --> 01:21:55,696
They're something much, much better.

885
01:21:55,801 --> 01:21:57,166
It is beautiful.

886
01:21:59,204 --> 01:22:01,536
Nanomites, it's beyond...

887
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,474
It's light years ahead
of what anyone else is doing in the field.

888
01:22:05,177 --> 01:22:06,667
Proximity alert.

889
01:22:06,778 --> 01:22:10,475
Aerial attack imminent.
All personnel to the bunker.

890
01:22:15,153 --> 01:22:17,815
Come on. Come on! What?

891
01:22:17,923 --> 01:22:20,255
What are you doing?
Don't close that. Don't...

892
01:22:21,693 --> 01:22:24,958
If we live, I'll show you everything.

893
01:22:29,668 --> 01:22:33,570
We survived that blast, somewhat.

894
01:22:33,672 --> 01:22:37,972
And Dr. Mindbender and I escaped
with his research, which I perfected

895
01:22:38,076 --> 01:22:41,136
and which you will
now experience first-hand.

896
01:22:41,246 --> 01:22:43,510
Does Ana know about this? About you?

897
01:22:43,615 --> 01:22:46,175
No, and she never will.

898
01:22:48,753 --> 01:22:50,311
Commence the launch sequence.

899
01:22:50,422 --> 01:22:55,985
Commencing launch sequence.
T- minus 4, 3, 2, 1.

900
01:22:56,428 --> 01:22:57,861
Ignite primary engines.

901
01:22:59,431 --> 01:23:01,023
We have ignition.

902
01:23:06,838 --> 01:23:08,635
They're launching the missiles!

903
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:48,175
We lost the Beijing missile.
Warhead 3 is down, sir.

904
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:50,305
- Alert all defenses.
- Yes, sir.

905
01:23:50,415 --> 01:23:51,712
He's here.

906
01:24:03,328 --> 01:24:05,694
- What about the other two?
- We gotta find the kill switches.

907
01:24:05,797 --> 01:24:06,957
They're already way too far out of range.

908
01:24:07,065 --> 01:24:09,761
Somebody has to get up there
and shoot those things down.

909
01:24:09,868 --> 01:24:13,167
Well, I guess that's me.

910
01:24:13,972 --> 01:24:15,269
- Sir.
- What is it?

911
01:24:15,373 --> 01:24:17,307
STRATCOM is tracking 3 warheads

912
01:24:17,409 --> 01:24:19,172
that have just launched off
the polar icecap.

913
01:24:19,277 --> 01:24:20,277
One was downed immediately.

914
01:24:20,378 --> 01:24:22,278
The other 2 are currently entering
the upper atmosphere.

915
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:23,813
We need to get you
down to the bunker, sir.

916
01:24:23,915 --> 01:24:26,577
Well, they haven't made any demands.
What's their plan?

917
01:24:28,954 --> 01:24:30,945
Now, this is very cool.

918
01:24:31,456 --> 01:24:33,754
- Yeah, but can you fly it?
- I can fly anything.

919
01:24:33,858 --> 01:24:36,383
You just find a way
to guide me to those warheads.

920
01:24:36,494 --> 01:24:38,758
- Right. Ripcord...
- Yeah?

921
01:24:41,666 --> 01:24:43,429
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

922
01:24:43,802 --> 01:24:45,531
- Hey, do me a favor.
- Yeah?

923
01:24:45,637 --> 01:24:47,696
- Save Duke.
- You got it.

924
01:24:57,282 --> 01:24:58,544
Let's go!

925
01:25:09,894 --> 01:25:12,192
The floor is pressure-plated
and laser-protected.

926
01:25:12,297 --> 01:25:15,494
Anything larger than a quarter
that touches that floor gets fried.

927
01:25:18,536 --> 01:25:22,734
You left me for dead, Duke,
and look at me.

928
01:25:23,908 --> 01:25:26,502
Now you'll know what it's like
to be a monster.

929
01:25:33,952 --> 01:25:35,852
- We don't have much time.
- Ana?

930
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:47,220
Oh, my God.

931
01:25:49,067 --> 01:25:51,627
- Ana!
- Security, to the operating chamber!

932
01:25:51,736 --> 01:25:54,261
- Rex!
- I press this, she dies.

933
01:25:54,372 --> 01:25:57,603
- You did this to your own sister!
- I loved my sister.

934
01:25:57,709 --> 01:26:01,611
Do you have any idea the state
she was in with me dead, you gone?

935
01:26:02,914 --> 01:26:05,883
Have you ever felt truly alone?

936
01:26:06,818 --> 01:26:10,845
I gave her a way to deal with the pain.
I gave her purpose.

937
01:26:11,056 --> 01:26:13,889
You could have stopped all of this
just by letting her know you were alive!

938
01:26:13,992 --> 01:26:16,187
Science requires sacrifice.

939
01:26:16,294 --> 01:26:18,728
All she's done was because of you!

940
01:26:18,830 --> 01:26:21,924
And because of you, Duke.
You abandoned her.

941
01:26:22,033 --> 01:26:25,230
- Let's not forget that point.
- I'm gonna kill you, Rex.

942
01:26:29,874 --> 01:26:31,899
- Is she still alive?
- For now.

943
01:26:32,010 --> 01:26:34,672
I thought we had complete control.
You said this couldn't happen.

944
01:26:34,779 --> 01:26:35,803
I didn't think it could.

945
01:26:35,914 --> 01:26:39,543
I've never seen anyone override
the programming, even momentarily.

946
01:26:39,651 --> 01:26:41,380
She did this for him.

947
01:26:41,986 --> 01:26:45,547
The pain must have been excruciating.

948
01:26:54,099 --> 01:26:55,691
What you'll have to do

949
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:59,463
is to rewire the laser panel's brain
by carefully...

950
01:27:01,239 --> 01:27:03,537
- Or you can just stab it.
- This is Scarlett. We're in.

951
01:27:04,442 --> 01:27:05,466
Deploy the SHARCs!

952
01:27:06,244 --> 01:27:07,506
Detaching SHARCs 1-3...

953
01:27:07,612 --> 01:27:10,513
Detaching SHARCs
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta.

954
01:27:10,615 --> 01:27:13,106
- Full speed ahead.
- Detaching SHARCs.

955
01:27:13,218 --> 01:27:16,619
SHARCs Victor, Franklin, Tango
into flanking positions.

956
01:27:16,721 --> 01:27:19,053
All right, boys. Attack formation.

957
01:27:32,470 --> 01:27:35,064
Fan out.
Wait until the Joes break formation.

958
01:27:35,473 --> 01:27:38,203
Stay tight. Here they come.

959
01:28:00,765 --> 01:28:03,165
- Fire up the pulse cannon!
- We're on it, sir.

960
01:28:06,604 --> 01:28:08,003
- I'll do it!
- Put it down!

961
01:28:08,106 --> 01:28:09,596
Your choice, Duke.

962
01:28:10,341 --> 01:28:11,933
Charging pulse cannon.

963
01:28:24,522 --> 01:28:26,217
Everybody stay tight on the enemy craft.

964
01:28:26,324 --> 01:28:28,189
Don't let that cannon catch you
out in the open.

965
01:28:28,293 --> 01:28:29,988
Bogey at 10 o'clock.

966
01:28:30,094 --> 01:28:31,823
I'm hit! I'm hit! I'm hit!

967
01:28:32,931 --> 01:28:36,594
Missile 2, all telemetry
and propulsion systems nominal.

968
01:29:04,596 --> 01:29:06,826
- Ripcord, can you hear me?
- Loud and clear, buddy.

969
01:29:06,931 --> 01:29:09,058
Doing Mach 6 and loving it!

970
01:29:09,934 --> 01:29:11,902
Come on, girl.
Time to show me what you got.

971
01:29:14,506 --> 01:29:17,407
Okay, Rip, I have the coordinates
of the other 2 warheads.

972
01:29:17,509 --> 01:29:20,171
The closest target is Moscow.
You'll have to hit that one first.

973
01:29:20,278 --> 01:29:21,768
Target 2 is Washington.

974
01:29:26,084 --> 01:29:27,483
You'll be safe down in this bunker, sir.

975
01:29:27,585 --> 01:29:30,315
- How soon before it strikes the city?
-17 minutes, sir.

976
01:29:30,421 --> 01:29:32,821
- It's all up to the Joes now.
- Please hurry, Mr. President.

977
01:29:32,924 --> 01:29:34,619
We need to get you buttoned up.

978
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:55,577
General Hawk, we've lost our engines.
We're completely disabled.

979
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:58,774
Somebody take out that damn cannon.
There's 200 Joes on that sub.

980
01:29:58,883 --> 01:30:00,817
We're on it, sir. All right, Snake,

981
01:30:00,919 --> 01:30:02,216
the cannon control room
should be right there,

982
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,220
where all the laser conduits converge.

983
01:30:05,223 --> 01:30:08,784
Did you think she loved you?
Did you imagine your life with her?

984
01:30:09,294 --> 01:30:11,159
All I know is,
neither one of you deserve her.

985
01:30:11,262 --> 01:30:13,753
- That's it. She dies!
- Don't do it, Rex!

986
01:30:26,778 --> 01:30:28,040
Come on.

987
01:30:30,348 --> 01:30:31,576
I'm gonna get you out of here.

988
01:30:33,618 --> 01:30:34,744
Get up!

989
01:30:35,386 --> 01:30:37,047
You're coming with me.

990
01:30:53,304 --> 01:30:56,671
Ripcord, the Moscow missile
will impact in 4 minutes.

991
01:30:56,774 --> 01:30:58,264
All right, I got a visual on it.

992
01:30:58,776 --> 01:30:59,902
Dead ahead.

993
01:31:00,845 --> 01:31:03,109
You have to knock it down
before it re-enters the atmosphere.

994
01:31:03,214 --> 01:31:04,909
If those nanomites hit the ground,
it's all over.

995
01:31:05,083 --> 01:31:06,380
They'll destroy the whole city.

996
01:31:06,484 --> 01:31:08,008
Houston, we have a problem.

997
01:31:08,119 --> 01:31:11,418
- The fire controls are not in here.
- What do you mean, not in there?

998
01:31:11,756 --> 01:31:13,417
I mean, I don't see them anywhere.

999
01:31:14,292 --> 01:31:15,657
It must be voice-activated.

1000
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:16,988
Okay. Fire!

1001
01:31:18,997 --> 01:31:22,091
Shoot! Blast away! Bust a cap!

1002
01:31:23,668 --> 01:31:26,762
- Nothing's happening!
- I bet it's in a different language.

1003
01:31:26,871 --> 01:31:30,034
Wait a minute. McCullen is Scottish.
Maybe the plane responds to Celtic.

1004
01:31:30,141 --> 01:31:33,201
- Try Teine.
- What?

1005
01:31:33,311 --> 01:31:37,179
- Teine. It's Celt, Scottish for fire.
- Okay, got it.

1006
01:31:46,124 --> 01:31:48,490
Nice going, ace.
You just saved Moscow.

1007
01:31:48,593 --> 01:31:51,357
Just doing my job.
Now guide me to Washington.

1008
01:31:57,735 --> 01:32:00,829
Yeah. Yeah, thanks, that's great news.
I'll let him know.

1009
01:32:00,938 --> 01:32:03,771
Sir, one of the Joes shot down
the warhead heading for Moscow.

1010
01:32:03,875 --> 01:32:05,172
Thank God.

1011
01:32:09,847 --> 01:32:12,111
What are you doing? Oh, my God!

1012
01:32:17,321 --> 01:32:18,686
It's done.

1013
01:32:31,669 --> 01:32:35,400
Hello, Mr. President.
Mr. McCullen sends his regards.

1014
01:32:36,274 --> 01:32:37,707
Oh, my God.

1015
01:32:39,644 --> 01:32:41,373
So, that's what this is all about.

1016
01:32:43,881 --> 01:32:45,849
All right. Keep tight, boys.

1017
01:32:45,950 --> 01:32:48,817
All guns on that cannon.
Torpedoes away!

1018
01:33:00,631 --> 01:33:01,757
I've just lost my wingman.

1019
01:33:01,866 --> 01:33:03,925
Retargeting Joe submarine.

1020
01:33:06,437 --> 01:33:07,995
I've got a shot.

1021
01:33:28,826 --> 01:33:32,091
Pulse cannon fault. Pulse cannon fault.

1022
01:33:32,764 --> 01:33:34,789
Cannon now offline.

1023
01:33:45,143 --> 01:33:48,442
- The whole damn system's down.
- I'm trying to bring it back online.

1024
01:33:55,453 --> 01:33:56,511
Now you die.

1025
01:34:19,477 --> 01:34:20,739
Launch immediately.

1026
01:34:20,845 --> 01:34:22,836
- Chart a course up to the ice pack.
- Yes, sir.

1027
01:34:38,396 --> 01:34:40,864
- We gotta go after Rex and McCullen.
- How could it be Rex?

1028
01:34:42,466 --> 01:34:44,331
Hey, Scarlett, it's Duke!

1029
01:34:44,435 --> 01:34:46,062
- He looks fine.
- But what's he doing with her?

1030
01:34:58,316 --> 01:35:01,444
Okay, we got a track on McCullen's sub.
He's headed up into the ice pack.

1031
01:35:04,555 --> 01:35:05,681
Duke, behind us!

1032
01:35:09,427 --> 01:35:11,588
Looks like they're onto us.
Ana, shoot those guys.

1033
01:35:11,696 --> 01:35:12,754
Love to.

1034
01:35:57,074 --> 01:36:00,771
When our master was killed,
you took a vow of silence.

1035
01:36:01,545 --> 01:36:03,843
Now you will die without a word.

1036
01:36:07,852 --> 01:36:10,184
All right, the second one in my sights.

1037
01:36:10,288 --> 01:36:13,485
Okay, Rip, you only got 30 seconds
before it enters the lower atmosphere.

1038
01:36:26,671 --> 01:36:27,763
I got you!

1039
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:37,470
- Ripcord, you missed.
- The warhead has entered

1040
01:36:37,581 --> 01:36:38,581
the lower atmosphere.

1041
01:36:38,683 --> 01:36:40,651
I know, I know! I'm on it, I'm on it!

1042
01:36:44,555 --> 01:36:45,613
Shit!

1043
01:36:47,758 --> 01:36:50,022
- I can't shake these guys.
- Duke, I'm out!

1044
01:36:50,394 --> 01:36:52,988
- All right, let's see what we got here.
- Black Ray, Eliminator, LAW.

1045
01:36:53,097 --> 01:36:55,759
Laser Artillery Weapon.
That sounds good.

1046
01:37:02,139 --> 01:37:03,333
- Scarlett!
- Hey, Duke!

1047
01:37:03,441 --> 01:37:04,499
I'm going after McCullen and Rex.

1048
01:37:04,608 --> 01:37:05,666
You guys better get the hell out of there.

1049
01:37:05,776 --> 01:37:07,801
I can't. Rip has one more warhead
to take down.

1050
01:37:07,912 --> 01:37:08,912
Rip, where is he?

1051
01:37:16,253 --> 01:37:19,051
The missile's just gone drone.
It's going in for the kill!

1052
01:38:21,118 --> 01:38:23,552
Sir, there's a hostile Mantis craft
coming up behind us.

1053
01:38:23,654 --> 01:38:24,951
- Seal the door.
- Sir.

1054
01:38:31,395 --> 01:38:32,885
There you are.

1055
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:44,705
One got through. I hit them!

1056
01:38:47,411 --> 01:38:49,208
Duke! They're back!

1057
01:38:53,117 --> 01:38:55,449
Going hot in 3, 2, 1.

1058
01:39:08,199 --> 01:39:10,861
There's gotta be another way around
to Rex and McCullen.

1059
01:39:10,968 --> 01:39:13,300
Charting new course for alternate route.

1060
01:39:21,378 --> 01:39:23,369
20 seconds until impact.

1061
01:39:23,481 --> 01:39:24,971
Come on, come on, come on.

1062
01:39:28,385 --> 01:39:30,012
You're too close, Rip! Back off!

1063
01:39:30,121 --> 01:39:34,148
Actually, I think
I'm just about close enough.

1064
01:39:51,876 --> 01:39:53,707
He's taking the nanomites
back into the upper atmosphere.

1065
01:40:03,554 --> 01:40:05,920
Ripcord, get out of that plane!

1066
01:40:06,023 --> 01:40:07,718
Almost there!

1067
01:40:10,361 --> 01:40:12,090
Eject, Ripcord, eject!

1068
01:40:22,306 --> 01:40:24,797
He did it. He actually did it.

1069
01:40:25,409 --> 01:40:26,569
Ripcord?

1070
01:40:29,113 --> 01:40:30,444
Ripcord?

1071
01:40:32,983 --> 01:40:34,041
Ripcord!

1072
01:40:34,151 --> 01:40:36,142
Didn't I ask you not to yell at me?

1073
01:40:38,756 --> 01:40:42,954
Everybody, listen up! We still have
a lot of Joes out there in harm's way.

1074
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:44,186
Let's bring them home.

1075
01:40:47,598 --> 01:40:50,226
- Did it work?
- Yes, yes, it worked.

1076
01:40:51,569 --> 01:40:55,335
Good. Because I think
I'm about to get arrested, again.

1077
01:40:56,941 --> 01:40:57,941
Don't move!

1078
01:40:58,042 --> 01:40:59,600
- Hey, hey, same team, same team!
- Hands up!

1079
01:40:59,710 --> 01:41:01,371
Same team.

1080
01:41:01,478 --> 01:41:03,105
Okay, okay, okay.

1081
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:11,847
- What's our status?
- We've lost aft thrusters and the sonar.

1082
01:41:11,956 --> 01:41:15,585
- We're running blind.
- Kill them. Kill all the Joes.

1083
01:41:15,693 --> 01:41:18,560
- Detonate the ice pack.
- Right away, sir.

1084
01:41:26,870 --> 01:41:29,998
They're telling the other ships to abort.
He's gonna blow the ice pack.

1085
01:41:30,107 --> 01:41:32,701
This is Duke calling all Joes.
The ice pack's coming down!

1086
01:41:32,810 --> 01:41:33,970
There's a ton of steel and ice

1087
01:41:34,078 --> 01:41:35,078
- headed your way!
- What?

1088
01:41:39,116 --> 01:41:41,812
Everybody, pull back! Pull back now!

1089
01:41:48,092 --> 01:41:50,185
Door! The door, the door! Get the door!

1090
01:41:53,564 --> 01:41:54,826
Come on!

1091
01:42:02,239 --> 01:42:05,675
Ana, we could get out of here right now,
free and clear, safe and sound.

1092
01:42:09,079 --> 01:42:11,673
- Let's get them.
- That's my girl.

1093
01:42:24,795 --> 01:42:27,628
- This is cutting it close, Duke.
- I'm not letting those 2 get away.

1094
01:42:30,801 --> 01:42:32,462
Come on, guys, get out of there!

1095
01:42:40,411 --> 01:42:41,708
Snake!

1096
01:43:21,852 --> 01:43:24,719
- This is Scarlett. We're all clear.
- This is Duke. We're clear, too.

1097
01:43:24,822 --> 01:43:26,449
Yo, Joe!

1098
01:43:32,496 --> 01:43:33,861
Yeah!

1099
01:43:51,281 --> 01:43:53,875
Now that we have
a moment to ourselves,

1100
01:43:54,852 --> 01:43:56,285
I've designed something

1101
01:43:56,387 --> 01:43:59,356
- especially for you, James.
- No!

1102
01:44:00,924 --> 01:44:02,858
This will only hurt a little.

1103
01:44:04,695 --> 01:44:08,131
What comes next, more so.

1104
01:44:13,203 --> 01:44:16,536
Nanomites, perfect little healers.

1105
01:44:30,154 --> 01:44:33,851
I've finally taken my place
in a long line of McCullens.

1106
01:44:33,957 --> 01:44:40,157
James McCullen is no more.
Now you are Destro.

1107
01:44:42,433 --> 01:44:44,594
What have you done to me?

1108
01:44:52,209 --> 01:44:57,738
The time has come for the cobra
to rise up and reveal himself.

1109
01:45:00,551 --> 01:45:04,851
You will call me Commander.

1110
01:45:16,467 --> 01:45:19,265
This is Captain Duke Hauser.
Prepare to be boarded.

1111
01:45:21,238 --> 01:45:22,330
Sir.

1112
01:45:25,108 --> 01:45:28,737
You are relentless, Duke.
I'll give you that much.

1113
01:45:29,847 --> 01:45:33,613
And what's to stop me
from blowing you out of the water?

1114
01:45:33,717 --> 01:45:37,084
Self-preservation. I'm taking you in, Rex.

1115
01:45:40,924 --> 01:45:42,755
You and what army?

1116
01:45:44,161 --> 01:45:45,423
My army.

1117
01:46:01,478 --> 01:46:04,936
You know, Duke,
this has only just begun.

1118
01:46:10,754 --> 01:46:12,381
I'll be waiting for you.

1119
01:46:24,835 --> 01:46:27,668
I've never seen encoding like this.
I mean, physically, she's fine,

1120
01:46:27,771 --> 01:46:30,399
but when Rex programmed them,
he sure didn't want them taken out.

1121
01:46:30,507 --> 01:46:32,839
- So there's nothing you can do for her?
- It'll take some time,

1122
01:46:32,943 --> 01:46:34,843
but we'll take them out.

1123
01:46:39,816 --> 01:46:41,408
Till we get those things
out of your head,

1124
01:46:41,518 --> 01:46:43,577
looks like you're gonna be
seeing a lot of me around here.

1125
01:46:43,687 --> 01:46:47,748
You can't save me, Duke.
No one can, not after all I've done.

1126
01:46:48,325 --> 01:46:50,190
Look, that wasn't you.

1127
01:46:53,063 --> 01:46:54,894
I'm not giving up on you.

1128
01:47:29,166 --> 01:47:31,760
- Man, we look good.
- Yeah, well, you better get used to it.

1129
01:47:31,868 --> 01:47:34,632
Heavy Duty thinks you guys
ought to stick around permanently.

1130
01:47:34,738 --> 01:47:35,932
So, you're asking us, right?

1131
01:47:36,039 --> 01:47:37,131
Yeah, 'cause he didn't sound
like he was asking.

1132
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:38,366
'Cause you gotta be asked
to join the G.I. Joes.

1133
01:47:38,475 --> 01:47:39,772
I'm asking.

1134
01:47:40,310 --> 01:47:41,368
Well, I'm in.

1135
01:47:41,478 --> 01:47:45,744
- How do you feel about this?
- I feel very emotional.

1136
01:47:46,650 --> 01:47:50,108
All Joes mobilize and ready check
for Operation Mongoose.

1137
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:53,485
All ground transports,
rendezvous at Base Brothers Grimm.

1138
01:47:53,590 --> 01:47:56,491
All Howler Hunters will rendezvous
at Base Roman Ruin.

1139
01:47:56,593 --> 01:47:58,151
Good luck, Joes.

1140
01:47:59,759 --> 01:48:05,559
Subtitles: Sickness

1141
01:48:30,127 --> 01:48:32,186
Mr. President, it's good to see you.

1142
01:48:32,295 --> 01:48:34,160
- Thank you. And you.
- It's nice to have you back safely, sir.

1143
01:48:34,264 --> 01:48:35,856
- Thank you. John.
- Welcome back, sir.

1144
01:48:35,966 --> 01:48:38,901
Thank you. Thank you all so much.
