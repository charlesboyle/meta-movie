<i>And now back to
Jim Carr's Sports Talk.</i>

16
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,396
Hi, Jim Carr again.

17
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:02,901
Denis, I know that some in our audience
don't know the finer points of hockey.

18
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,950
Could you tell them,
for example, what is icing?

19
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:10,245
Icing happen when the puck
come down, bang, you know,

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,119
before the other guys,
nobody there.

21
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:17,419
My arm go comes up, then the
game stop, then start up.

22
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,963
I see.
What is high-sticking?

23
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:24,259
High-sticking happen when the guy
take the stick, and he go like that.

24
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,086
You don't do that.
You don't do that?

25
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,263
Oh, no, never, never.
Why not?

26
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,467
Against the rules. You know,
you're stupid when you do that.

27
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,099
Just some English pig
with no brains, you know.

28
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,645
What is slashing?

29
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:38,099
Slashing is like that,
you know.

30
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,062
And...there's
a penalty for that?

31
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:47,446
Yeah. And for trip also,
you know, like that.

32
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:51,700
And for hook like this.
And for spear like that.

33
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,155
All bad.

34
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:57,084
You do that,
you go to the box, you know.

35
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,380
Two minutes by yourself,
and you feel shame, you know.

36
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,709
And then you get free.

37
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,050
The Chiefs are at home tonight against
Hyannisport at the War Memorial at 8:00.

38
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,598
Good seats
are still available.

39
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,767
<i>A look at sports.</i>

40
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,136
I think that went well.

41
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,516
<i>At defense for the Chiefs,</i>

42
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:21,772
<i>number 5, Billy Charlebois!</i>

43
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,822
<i>At center for the Chiefs, number
7, player-coach Reggie Dunlap!</i>

44
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,444
Dunlop, you stink!

45
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:33,279
<i>At left wing,
number 10, Ned Braden!</i>

46
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,784
I hate you, Braden!

47
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:40,085
<i>Playing right wing,
number 14, Jean-Guy Drouin!</i>

48
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,707
Frog pussy!

49
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:45,963
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
our national anthem.</i>

50
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:27,963
Go get them, kid.
Hey, Denis!

51
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,887
How's it going, Nick?
I'm drunk.

52
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,191
Nah! I'm not bullshitting ya.
Got shitfaced on the bus.

53
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,735
Louise left me,
and that son of a bitch

54
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,188
keeps playing me
when he knows I'm shitfaced.

55
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,402
Geez, I'm really sorry.

56
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:55,281
Anybody throws me against the boards,
I'm gonna piss all over myself.

57
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,512
Take it down
to the other end, Ned.

58
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:31,693
I thought I'd get Jerry one of those
"Great Ideas of the World" sets.

59
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,445
You can look up the ideas alphabetically:
arts, mechanics, philosophy.

60
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:42,374
Yeah. Johnny always says you can just
screw so much and drink so much.

61
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,831
He's screening me!
Move him out!

62
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,463
We got Charlestown
trailing three to nothing

63
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,421
with 10:48 left
in the first period.

64
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,474
Oops! Correction, folks,
that's two to nothing.

65
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,098
We don't want to make it any tougher
for the Chiefs than it already is.

66
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,988
That's what
you're paid for, Braden!

67
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,994
Try winning a game
for a change.

68
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,167
Nice going, kid.

69
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,958
<i>ANNOUNCER.' Number 10, Braden,
with his 18th goal of the year.</i>

70
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,591
<i>Assisted by number 7, Dunlop,
and number 14, Drouin.</i>

71
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:41,016
<i>Ned Braden is now the leading
scorer in the Federal League.</i>

72
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,434
Tie it up out there, guys!

73
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,230
Come on, defense.
Get the puck outta here!

74
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,105
Hit him, Billy,
hit him!

75
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,206
With us in the press box is injured
Chiefs' defenseman Dave Carlson.

76
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,581
Dave, is it tough sitting up here
watching your team lose like this?

77
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,127
Definitely, Jim.

78
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,330
You injured your knee
in the Peterboro game.

79
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,041
No.
No? I thought you had.

80
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,212
No, I have a cold. The runny
nose, sore throat, all that.

81
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:22,846
I went out in that storm last
week to start my car.
I didn't have my jacket on.

82
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,926
It may have settled
in my kidneys.

83
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,853
We got action here.

84
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,729
Hit him with your purse,
ya pussy!

85
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,563
Jesus, look at Brophy.
He's plastered!

86
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,737
He told me so!

87
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,566
If anybody boards him, he's
gonna piss all over himself.

88
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,196
Piss all over himself.

89
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:45,031
<i>Faire "pipi," eh?
No, no, I okay.</i>

90
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:49,994
Clear the puck, Billy!
Get this guy outta my crease!

91
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:08,011
Joe McGrath. Oh, yes, miss!

92
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,025
Get off the ice, Nick.
You're gonna kill yourself.

93
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:34,963
They're on the ice right now
giving their all.
They will be ready.

94
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,963
Ensemble number 32,
entitled "Omar Sharif"

95
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,216
and modeled by Chiefs'
defenseman Billy Charlebois

96
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:47,552
who hails from, if I can read the
card, Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.

97
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,307
Notice the padded shoulders,
giving the '40s look.

98
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,809
You look nice,
real spiffy.

99
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,483
Keep in mind that the perfect
accessory for the man in your life

100
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,232
is a season ticket
to the Chiefs games.

101
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,983
I look like some cocksucking faggot!
You seen Reg or Braden?

102
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,067
Joe, enough's enough.

103
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,280
Nowhere in my contract does it say
I gotta make a fool outta myself.

104
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,284
Have you seen Dunlop or Braden?
I'm gonna flash them, Joe.

105
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,834
I'm gonna walk down
that aisle,

106
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,378
open this bathrobe
and wiggle my dick at them.

107
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,123
You will not. Yes, lam, Joe.
You know why?

108
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,879
Because I want you to have
a heart attack and die

109
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,801
so we never have to
do this again.

110
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,512
You and your fucking fashion show!
It's good publicity.

111
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,966
You fellas have not been drawing them
in the way you have in the past.

112
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:31,178
I'm gonna wiggle it at them,
you cheap bastard.
You better be prepared

113
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,856
'cause when I yank it out,
everybody in that audience,
with the exception of my wife,

114
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,558
is gonna be running
for the exits.

115
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,393
Ensemble number 8

116
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,821
as we watch Chiefs'
defenseman Johnny Upton...

117
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,076
Joe McGrath here.
Just checking on Dunlop...

118
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,788
We have two generations
of pro hockey with us

119
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,090
for you folks to call in
and question.

120
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,294
Player-coach Reggie Dunlop
and right wing Ned Braden.

121
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,970
Reggie, you represent
the old guard,

122
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,548
one of the iron men
of the Federal League.

123
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,804
You've been playing pro hockey
for how many years?

124
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,227
Quite a few, Jim.

125
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:15,351
Is that right'? And on the other
side of the scale, Ned Braden

126
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,354
who's a college graduate,
and an American citizen!

127
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,352
You went to Princeton
and were All-Eastern.

128
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,655
That's what it said in
the yearbook, Jim. Okay.

129
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,445
Our lines are open.
Anything you folks wanna know

130
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,995
about the fascinating world
of pro hockey, here we go!

131
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,994
Hi, there. Jim Carr.
What's your question?

132
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,748
<i>Dunlop,
you old fan', why don't you
get outta the game and let...</i>

133
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:40,080
We... We're gonna spin some music while
we're waiting for our next caller.

134
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,542
Jim, I know a lot of kids
would enjoy coming to the games

135
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,003
to see a great veteran
like Reggie Dunlop skate.

136
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,429
While we're waiting
for our next caller,

137
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,723
we'd like to remind
you folks calling in

138
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,847
to keep your questions within
the boundaries of good taste.

139
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:59,315
What kind of broad is it who calls
up and <i>says</i> something like that?

140
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,437
They're supposed
to be our fans.

141
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,519
Just 'cause we're losing...
Who cares? It's over.

142
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,823
Idiot McGrath and his shitty P.R. schemes.
I hate that cheap bastard.

143
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,032
What are these poor fuckers gonna
do when they close the mill?

144
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,489
They ain't
closing the mill!

145
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:17,542
They're just jacking the guys around
so they'll feel happy they got jobs.

146
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,210
It's the old tactic,
the mind-fuck.

147
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,789
Announced it this morning.
April 1, they shut it tight.

148
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,584
Yeah?
Yeah!

149
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,462
That's a big surprise.

150
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:32,015
Ten thousand mill workers
have been placed on waivers.

151
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,594
What the hell are they
gonna do with them?
I don't know.

152
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,725
Every sucker for himself.

153
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,604
Hey, who's she?

154
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,527
Slipped my mind.

155
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,651
Oh, yeah? Maybe
your wife'll remember her.

156
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:56,703
You're the best girl in
the whole world. Yes, you are.

157
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:00,536
Ruby! How's my Ruby?
How's my girl, huh?

158
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,997
You're a sweetheart. I missed you.
You're a sweetheart.

159
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,923
Are you my girl?

160
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,503
Beginning to like it here, huh?
No, I hate it here!

161
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,842
I'm cracking up.
You know what I mean?
You don't look bad.

162
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:19,350
I can't figure it out.
I'm slipping fast.
I think you look fine.

163
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:23,229
Slow down.
You're making her nervous.

164
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:26,061
- Jerry, I'd like to cancel the order.
- Joe?

165
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,148
And there's another matter that's
come up and is kinda important...

166
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,107
Would you hold it a minute?

167
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,068
Joe, what happens to us
when the mill closes?

168
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:37,281
Don't worry about it.
 The new boys are coming
in on the 4:15 bus.

169
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,491
I wanna know
what happens...

170
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,126
Who are these guys?
I never even heard of them.

171
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,125
Son, just pick them up and
take them over to the hotel.

172
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,206
I've done enough shit work.

173
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,633
The fucking fans are calling
in with dirty talk.

174
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,505
Nothing in my contract
<i>says</i> I gotta...
Do you see this quarter?

175
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:57,058
It used to be a nickel. Now, the
golden years are behind you.

176
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,259
One season, maybe two,

177
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,391
you'll be hanging up the
blades and retiring the ax.

178
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,014
Fuck it. Then you'll
remember it was Joe McGrath

179
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,691
who trained you
for the front office.

180
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,731
I'm sorry, Jerry. Like I say,
I'd like to cancel the order.

181
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,737
In fact, I've got some
equipment I'd like to sell.

182
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:17,537
Skate sharpener, massage
table, jacuzzi, our bus.

183
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,588

184
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,884

185
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,684
Hey! Hey!

186
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:48,485
Hey! You guys the Hanson's?

187
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,320
Fucking machine took my quarter.
Who are you?

188
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:56,614
Reggie Dunlop, the coach.
Grab your frigging gear
and let's get going.

189
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,867
Okay. C'mon, Steve. Let's go.
Took my quarter!

190
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,574
<i>You think they show
Speed Racer here?</i>

191
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,292
Hey, guys!
Hey! Wait up. Hold up.

192
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,998
Look what I got!

193
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,126
You guys triplets
or something?

194
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,588
No, I'm in the middle.
Steve's 20, Jeff's 18.

195
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,265
Where are you from?
Iron League.

196
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,052
The Iron League, huh?
Lotta fights?
Nah.

197
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,103
Hey, I want a soda!

198
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,358
We paid for you here for a week, then
you gotta find a room of your own.

199
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:32,563
Okay, coach. Gimme a grape or an orange.
None of that root beer!

200
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,733
We go on the road tomorrow...

201
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:42,114
- We're on the road in the morning.
- I don't want any...

202
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,073
The bus leaves the War
Memorial at 8:00 A.M.

203
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,912
I gave you a quarter
at the bus station.

204
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,118
Well, will you give me
another dime?

205
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,623
I'm saving the dime
to call Mom.

206
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,704
Jesus Christ.

207
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,923
You cheap son of a bitch!
Are you crazy?
Those guys are retards!

208
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,849
I got a good deal
on those boys.

209
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,393
The scout said
they showed a lot of promise.

210
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,348
They brought their
fucking toys with them!

211
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,604
I'd rather have them playing with their
toys than playing with themselves.

212
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,856
They're too dumb
to play with themselves!

213
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,905
Every piece of garbage that comes
on the market, you gotta buy it!

214
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,608
Reg, that reminds me.

215
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,820
I was coaching
in Omaha in 1948,

216
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:25,373
and Eddie Shore sends me this guy
who's a terrible masturbator.

217
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,871
Couldn't control himself.

218
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,044
He would get
deliberate penalties

219
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,373
so he could get into the
penalty box all by himself,

220
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,208
and damned if he wouldn't,
you know.

221
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,211
Oh, Joe, Jesus.

222
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,046
What was his name?

223
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:49,477
Move back. There you go.
Number three.

224
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,273

229
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,331
That's good writing, Dickie.

230
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,163
I was trying to capture
the spirit of the thing.

231
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,418
Oh, you did.

232
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,631
Want a beer
to go along with that?

233
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,882
It's ridiculous
for us to be here.

234
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,306
We stick out like a couple
of sore thumbs.

235
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,601
I'm doing what I like.
It's making you crazy too.

236
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,099
You're turning into a zombie.
You told me so.

237
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,021
I don't wanna have
a fight again.

238

Your father'd give you a job.

241
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:49,411
I'm all for that.
Always good to have choices.

242
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,369
I just wanna get out
of this goddamn dump!

243
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,133
You take the van.
I'll keep the dog.

244
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:08,052
Hey, Lily! Come on...
What's the matter with her?

245
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,772
You're bullshit!
You're really bullshit!
You're drunk!

246
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:13,848
You're right,
he's bullshit.

247
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,559
Yeah'? Well, he and I are the
only decent items in here.

248
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,275
Why should she give a shit what
other people think of her?

249
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,776
She's just scrapping!

250
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,483
My heart goes out to her.

251
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,160
You guys gotta stop losing.
Get the power play together.

252
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,078
We're working on it.

253
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,498
Is he nice to her?

254
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:38,423
Yes. He love her!
He tell me, "I love her!"

255
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,838
God, maybe Braden's a faggot.
Ever think of that?

256
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:46,014
You crazy! He has a big
cock like a horse!

257
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,863
You think that lady in the red
dress will go home with me?

258
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:05,112
No, she's not your type.
How much?

259
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,286
Five dollars she don't
even look at your face.

260
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:15,869
<i>Aha, ha, aha</i>

261
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:19,126
<i>You've got
a cute way of talking</i>

Francine, you look terrific.
You're right.

00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,645
You've been had.
That's his wife.

266
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,686
So, how's your money
holding out?

267
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,693
There's a beer in
the fridge if you want one.

268
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,070
Is that a new dress?
Sort of.

269
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,823
Looks good. Kinda tight.

270
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,830
I think I'm gaining
a little weight.

271
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:58,161
I don't know. Maybe
it's better tight. Maybe.

272
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,506
Is that the first time
you wore that dress?

273
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:09,047
Been going out?
Getting around?

274
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,221
Been seeing somebody
in that dress?

275
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,266
Making out?

276
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,937
That's none of your
business anymore.

277
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:23,316
Jesus Christ, Francine. I
think about you all the time.

278
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,442
Nothing is ever over.

279
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,116
If I wasn't so goddamn busy,
I'd see more of you.

280
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,616
I was gonna come down the
other night and ask if you
wanted to go to the Aces.

281
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:35,369
But, I don't know,
something came up.

282
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,784
What?

283
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,628
You need dough?

284
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,501
Save your money, Reggie.
You're gonna need it.

285
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,877
Who me?

286
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,176
The minute they close the mill,
the Chiefs are gonna fold.

287
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,594
That's bullshit.

288
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,886
These people
are gonna be broke.

289
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,181
They're not gonna be going
to hockey games.

290
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,553
And you're not getting
any younger.

291
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,260
I've got nothing
to worry about.

292
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,641
I coach. I got experience.
You're no good at it.

293
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,564
Every player on that team
thinks I'm the greatest.

294
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,435
What?

295
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,943
You're a losing coach.
You can't make them win.

296
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,275
Ah, geez.

297
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,701
I was thinking about you
the other day.

298
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:16,031
I was trying to imagine you
when you were through with
hockey, and I couldn't.

299
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:21,244
There was nobody there.
What are you gonna do?

300
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,080
I'm gonna come back to you!

301
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,208
Too little too late.

302
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,429
Hey, Charlie!

303
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,728
Ned? Ned!

304
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,144
I underlined
the fuck scenes for ya.

305
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:49,572
Get back in the van. You're
gonna catch pneumonia.

306
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,624
Go on back to the van
'cause you're gorgeous

307
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,794
and you're gonna
catch pneumonia!

308
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,801
Go get her, Billy.

309
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,394
Back in the old iron lung.

310
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,143
She underlines
the fuck scenes for ya?

311
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,150
She underlines
the fuck scenes,

312
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,148
she must worship
the ground you walk on.

313
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,446
They teach you how to
underline in college.

314
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,990
Not the fuck scenes,
they don't.

315
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:37,320
Braden, you gotta learn
to put out more.
You know what I mean?

316
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:49,124
Holy Mother of God! Ned, are
you seeing what I'm seeing?

317
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,342
Hey, Billy.

318
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,556
Jesus, it's finally happened.

319
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,552
Hi, guys.
How ya doing?

320
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,438
They're horrible looking!

321
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,141
Don't look at me. It's
McGrath's doing, not mine.

322
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,943
What'd the old man trade
for these assholes?
A used puck bag?

323
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,272
I think
it's a fucking disgrace.

324
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,320
Watch Braden.
He's gonna do something.
Hi.

325
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,403
Are you guys brothers?

326
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:22,116
Are you guys brothers?
What a life!

327
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,791
Bets on the trip.

328
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:27,211
Walter's entrusted me with our E.T.A.
to Lancaster. $5 limit.

329
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,039
I'm ready to take
estimates from the membership.

330
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,466
Walter's the leading contender...
Hey, Reg.

331
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,465
...for the outdoor record
Charlestown to Lancaster.

332
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,923
All aboard, son.
Let's go, Walt.

333
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:44,479
Where are the new boys? Oh, son.
There are your brothers.

334
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,147
Why is the fucking old man
making this trip?

335
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,725
I don't know.

336
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,694
McGRATH: We're expecting
great things from you boys.

337
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,701
Walt, you didn't tell me you
were holding out on your old bookmaker.

338
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,327
I'm gonna have to
give them odds!

339
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,750
<i>Ooh, and it's all right</i>

340
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,169
<i>And it's coming on</i>

341
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,917
<i>We gotta get right back</i>

342
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,872
<i>To where we started from</i>

343
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,254
<i>Love is good, love is strong</i>

344
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,883
On the stick. Let's go, Denis.
Two dollars.

345
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,506
Two bucks. I'll call.

346
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,842
Fold.

347
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,762
Let's see it.
Two and sixes.

348
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,690
That's nice!
I'm out.

349
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,358
Kings over!

350
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:35,108
Fuck! I lose my blouse.
Shirt. Shirt.

351
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:36,693
Shit.

352
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,868
If you sign your contract over
to me, I'll prorate your <i>losses.</i>

353
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,287
Jesus Christ, Braden!
You would, wouldn't you?

354
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,035
My ambition is to win
all your contracts.

355
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,866
Become the owner of this
fucking club, run it my way.

356
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,917
I'd make a fortune.

357
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,337
Compulsory fashion shows
every afternoon.

358
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,005
Radiothons twice a week.

359
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,082
Recycled jock straps.

360
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,417
Who owns the club anyway?

361
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,628
I don't know.
You don't know?

362
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,514
What do you mean?
A corporation owns it.

363
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,263
Who cares?
You get your check.

364
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,561
That's the spirit, Reg.
Hey, pot's light.

365
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,638
- Who's in?
- Not for long.

366
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,934
What's the game?
Same game. Jacks or better.

367
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,191
With nothing wild,
right?

368
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:29,325
<i>...for two
to gorgeous Honolulu!</i>

369
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,412
<i>Oh, my God! You'll be
staying at the all-new...</i>

370
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,133
Hey, Drouin,
change the channel!

371
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,210
"Changez la canal. <i>"</i>

372
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,513
Jean-Guy, leave it.

373
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,101
Shittiest rink in the fucking league!
Ice is a goddamn disgrace.

374
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:50,430
You oughta put some fucking
Downy in these jerseys.

375
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,812
Hey, guys.
Wow, we're in trouble.

376
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:57,065
What?
Oh, shit, he's here!

377
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,691
Who?
Ogilthorpe.

378
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,739
Oggie Ogilthorpe?

379
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,782
"Ogiltorp"?
Ogilthorpe.

380
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,702
They oughta throw this
fucking guy in San Quentin.

381
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,121
He is a criminal element.

382
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:10,325
The worst goon in hockey today.
A real cement head.

383
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,956
Big Afro. Twenty-one, twenty-two.
Watch out for him.

384
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,083
He's not playing.
He's suspended.

385
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,962
That's Oggie!
All right, guys!

386
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:25,882
Big crowd out there. Let's really
try to win this one, hey, boys?

387
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:30,477
Gotta hand it to the old bastard.
He's highly original.

388
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,806
That man traveled 15 hours
by bus to say that?

389
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,641
That felt good.

390
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,403
What are you guys doing?

391
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,238
Putting on the foil!
Every game.

392
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,868
You want some?

393
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,415
No.

394
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:03,176
Jesus fucking Christ.
They don't leave the bench.

395
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,674
Charlie...

396
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,936
McGRATH: Come on now. The Chiefs
are a terrific organization!

397
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,186
But the mill is closing,
and next year

398
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:19,189
I'd be interested
in a good front-office job.

399
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,895
Al, that's why
made the trip!

400
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,572
I wanted to talk to you
fellas face-to-face.

401
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,775
Excuse me
just a minute.

402
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:32,999
<i>Push that pelvis
way up there.</i>

403
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,585
<i>Way, way up there.</i>

404
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,422
Let's pay it
smart out there tonight.

405
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,875
I wanna see a lot of work
from you guys.

406
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,711
Use your heads on the
ice out there, will ya?

407
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,638
Christ, we all know how to play hockey.
Just play it smart.

408
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,057
Get out there
and stick them!

409
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,429
Fuck them.
Christ, pop them!

410
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,852
Let's get our share!
Let's go! Come on!

411
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,429
Let's go now!

412
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,398
We need this win.
We got a lot of losses...

413
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,397
Yeah, we got
a lot of them!

414
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,652
Go to the top! That's what
we're here for. To win!

415
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,235
Play heads-up out there.
Let's be smart.

416
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:10,945
Man for man, we're better
than any fucking club

417
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:13,747
if we just put
our minds to it.

418
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,873
Come on, Braden.
Our line starts.

419
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,748
Come on! Let's go!

420
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,926
It's fucking embarrassing.

421
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:55,323
Come on, guys! We can get it back!
What for? We're history.

422
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,282
What are you talking about?
What does that mean?

423
00:26:57,366 --> 00:27:00,620
McGrath's in there trying to
get himself anotherjob.
Fucking team's folding.

424
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:04,123
I knew there was a
reason he made the trip.
Nobody told me anything.

425
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:08,552
The fucker was holding onto the news
until he could scrounge another job.

426
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,971
Jesus Christ.
Cover his wrinkled old ass.

427
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,845
Fucking Chrysler Plant,
here I come.

428
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,845
<i>The team, fini, kaput.
Fini?</i>

429
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,769
<i>Gears'
goal scored by number 5.</i>

430
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,563
<i>Time of goal 8:04.</i>

431
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,365
This is the last season.
It'll be announced tomorrow.

432
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:50,128
I'm too old to be traded again.
A one in a million chance.

433
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,965
I'm gonna be calling my brother-in-law
in the fucking Chrysler plant.

434
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,683
Operator? Operator?

435
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:00,103
Bernard, they close it.

436
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,558
Yeah.
I want to échanger.

437
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:07,316
Bernard, call Detroit.
Tell them bullshit!

438
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:11,194
Yeah. Yeah, something.
No, wait a minute.

439
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:14,694
Ned, what's échanger in English?
Trade me right fucking now.

440
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,778
Trade me right fucking now!

441
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,489
And hang up.

442
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,959
Hello?

443
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,746
Wait a minute. Reg?

444
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,081
Yeah?

445
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,888
Yeah? Hey!

446
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:38,388
If I had to do it again, I
would've gotten an education.

447
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:43,394
You know what I mean? Look at Ned.
He doesn't have to depend on hockey.

448
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,608
What are you doing here?

449
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:50,980
Where's Hanrahan?

450
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:55,318
I know a good bar here.
The Palm Isle.

451
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,028
Fucked the barmaid
last trip.

452
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,246
I mean,

453
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,622
I walked into the place, she comes
up to me without even saying hello,

454
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,080
and just rubs against me...
Come on, Mo. Jesus. What?

455
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:12,384
She had her jugs up
against my suit.

456
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:16,301
Nipples as hard <i>as</i> little rocks.
Right, Morris.

457
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,132
Yeah. What's the address?

458
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,803
Any of you guys know the
Palm Isle in this town?

459
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:22,932
Yeah, don't move.

460
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,436
<i>Before Larry has his
one chance at our jackpot bowl,</i>

461
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:29,644
<i>is there anyone you'd like
to say hello to back home?</i>

462
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,272
Ten bucks he says "all the
guys at work." Wife and kids!

463
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:36,029
<i>Look into the camera
and say hello to anybody.</i>

464
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:39,662
<i>I'd like to say hi to all
the guys at work if I can.</i>

465
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,375
Put my fucking car back
on the track!

466
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:57,053
One more lap! Hi, coach. Hi.

467
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:06,143
Two nothing. Two nothing.
Brought your cars with you, huh?

468
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,189
We're on the road.
All set to go.

469
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,517
Tell us when.

470
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,729
Oh, I'm shuffling
lines around.

471
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,860
I'll let you know when I
get it straightened out.

472
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,816
Okay, coach.
See you later, coach.

473
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,901
Five nothing.

474
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:26,041
The thing's not working! I quit.
I don't wanna play no more.

475
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:29,461
You broke the darn car.
How am I supposed to play?

476
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:40,431
You are the first man I've slept
with since I left Hanrahan.

477
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:44,009
Oh, Suzanne,
a beautiful woman like you?

478
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,226
I've been sleeping
with women.

479
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,400
Are you shocked?

480
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,648
No.

481
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:01,611
Did you ever want to
sleep with a man? No.

482
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,779
Never?

483
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:05,910
No!

484
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:12,288
I don't blame you though. I mean,
women's bodies are beautiful.

485
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,544
But men's bodies,
I see them everywhere.

486
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,547
In the locker rooms,
cocks all over the place.

487
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:21,262
Do you wanna know how it happened?
No. That's okay.

488
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:24,808
No, that's all right, 'cause I
have to tell it in court anyway.

489
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,725
Every time Hanrahan
went out on the road,

490
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:32,980
I would go over to this wife's
house and we would get drunk.

491
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:37,734
We would talk about how depressed and
lonely we were without the guys.

492
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,408
Every week...

493
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:46,660
Then, one night we were talking
about how we hated the life,

494
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:50,288
and how we had never done
much of anything ourselves.

495
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,750
I don't know why, really.

496
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:57,800
We were like kids. We started
playing with one another.

497
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,551
We were drunk as usual.

498
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,965
And the next week
we did it sober,

499
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:08,018
and it was terrific!

500
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:18,107
At the end of the day, I think
about women, about women's bodies.

501
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,531
Maybe all that will change.
Maybe I'll wind up sleeping
with old goalies.

502
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,608
Things being what they are,
who knows?

503
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:27,617
When Hanrahan found out
about it, he went crazy!

504
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:31,166
He said if I was a dyke,
that made him a queer.

505
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:35,204
And he started slapping me around.
I ended up in the hospital.

506
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,549
Jesus! Yeah. I'm on the lam.
I'm hiding out.

507
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,843
We play him next week,
you know.

508
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:46,469
Oh, God. I got so sick of those games.
They seem so childish.

509
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,726
The Chiefs are folding.

510
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,353
The mill's closing
and the economy and stuff.

511
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:59,858
I just found out about it. I
don't know what I'm gonna do.

512
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:04,404
Christ, a handsome man
like you, Reggie?

513
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:06,952
It ain't easy.

514
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:11,624
I don't see myself in one of those
bullshit 9:00 to 5:00 jobs.

515
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,210
You could get traded. Suzanne,
I ain't a rookie anymore.

516
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:18,585
So far <i>as</i> the coaching goes,
the Chiefs are...

517
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:25,004
Hey, use your imagination.
That's what I've been doing.

518
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,588
Look at me!

519
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,016
Here I am a no-good,
runaway hockey wife.

520
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,220
A dyke?

521
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:37,558
Yes.

522
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,945
Turn it off!
I hate it!

523
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:54,621
I hate it. Turn it off! Don't
touch that television set!

524
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,202
I'm sorry about
the Chiefs, Reg.

525
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,538
I'm doing a tribute
to the team on Sunday.

526
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:02,625
"Chiefs fold. A sad commentary."
Somewhat along those lines.

527
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,550
Dickie?
Huh?

528
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:08,802
Something's afloat. On the Q.T.,
I think they're gonna sell us.

529
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,554
It's hush-hush and I can't
name names, but let's say

530
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:12,976
that there's

531
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:17,147
a senior citizens' community in
the market for a hockey team.

532
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,141
The Chiefs?

533
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,397
Actually, it's Florida.

534
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:25,231
They're getting a bunch of old
geezers from the northeast.

535
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:29,568
And what do you think those old
geezers really miss in Florida?

536
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,621
I think there are a lot
of shysters in Florida.

537
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:36,576
Hockey. Their own team.
A Saturday night game.

538
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,958
Hell, those poor old people, they
gotta have something to root for.

539
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,130
You're a pussy!

540
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:46,051
Daddy, he called me a pussy, and
then he changed the station.

541
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:50,013
Don't bother your daddy now.
Work it out amongst yourselves.

542
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:55,017
So, now...let me
get this straight.

543
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,767
A retirement community
has bought the Chiefs.

544
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,814
Oh, no! No.
I said negotiating.

545
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,562
That's not much to go on!

546
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,770
Dickie, they've already
built the rink!

547
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:07,402
They've dumped
a lot of capital into this.

548
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,984
What they're really looking for
is a cheap deal on a team.

549
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:14,784
And since we ain't exactly
the Boston Bruins...

550
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:20,168
How could anybody in his right
mind buy a fifth-place team?

551
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:24,214
That situation is gonna be
changed, I guarantee you.

552
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,795
Come on, watch your wing!

553
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,298
Hey, Hanrahan!

554
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,720
Hanrahan?

555
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,432
Cover the point! Goddamn
it, cover the point.

556
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,680
Come on, Mo!
Give it to them!

557
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,229
It's along the boards.
Nail him! Nail him!

558
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:52,113
Hanrahan,
Suzanne sucks pussy!

559
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,035
Get him the fuck
outta there, will ya?

560
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,916
Behind the net!

561
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,795
Hanrahan, she's a dyke!
I know! I know!

562
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,593
Take it out!

563
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,520
She's a lesbian!

564
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,394
Son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!

565
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,386
You're nuts, Hanrahan!

566
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,309
He wouldn't dare pull
anything like that on Johnny.

567
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,904
It's all over,
it's all over. That's it.

568
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,785
That's it, that's all,
that's it.

569
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,329
Go!
What the fuck?

570
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,281
He's the fucking one
who started it.

571
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,868
Son of a bitch!
Jesus Christ!

572
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,713
Son of a bitch,
I'll kill you!

573
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,590
We got one!

574
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,843
Good job, guys. That's the way!
Two points, that's it!

575
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:48,104
My allergy to those fucking
fans, you know, has returned.

576
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,151
That ends the longest
fucking losing streak.

577
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,524
What'd he say to Hanrahan?
Two points, eh?

578
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,034
Hey, Reg? Reg,
what'd you say to him?

579
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:07,586
I told him his wife was a dyke.
No!

580
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,129
Yeah!
Fuck.

581
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,424
Jesus Christ! No wonder
he flipped his lid.

582
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:15,252
Anybody who'd call my old lady a
dyke, I'd go fucking bananas.

583
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:17,383
His wife is a dyke!

584
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:21,804
Jesus Christ. Poor fucking guy.
Does that make him a fag?

585
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:25,513
Fuck him! Hanrahan's an ape. I knew
it'd piss the shit outta of him.

586
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,222
She's a fantastic gal.

587
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,775
I mean, fantastic!
I knew it'd drive him berserk.

588
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:32,648
You nailed him, coach.

589
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,446
You nailed him in the fucking head.
Nailed him in his mind.

590
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:37,775
He deserved it!
Yeah, yeah!

591
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:41,153
That was wrestling shit
out there.

592
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,330
They didn't have a backup goalie.
It was a garbage goal.

593
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,953
No. You gotta twist them
and fuck with them.

594
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,534
It was a garbage win.

595
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,673
Hey! Hey, Lily!

596
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,259
Lil, where're
you going?

597
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:19,945
Hey, Lily!

598
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,117
Hey, Lily.

599
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,992
Hey!

600
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:32,628
Lil?

601
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:40,258
Jesus, Lily, there's been three rapes and
two murders in this park in one year.

602
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,009
I didn't do it.

603
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:46,260
We're gonna freeze. If you leave,
you won't have that problem.

604
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:13,002
What's the story on that dog?
What?

605
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,668
What's the story on that dog?

606
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,385
That's the dog that saved
Charlestown from the 1938 flood.

607
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,053
Well, fuck him.

608
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,976
He's just gonna shock her
with his views on life.

609
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:32,435
If you were to come up
to my apartment right now,

610
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,766
I'd fix you something hot
to drink, I'd rub your back.

611
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,272
Maybe we could find a
good game on TV. Great.

612
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:41,528
I'd even fix you something to eat.
Tell you some stories.

613
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,951
By the time pneumonia set in,
you'd be sound asleep.

614
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,618
I'll see you around.

615
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,546
<i>He's been so kind to me.</i>

616
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,999
<i>He comes in every day.</i>

617
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:02,882
<i>He doesn't want
to rush your progress now.</i>

618
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,965
<i>I'll invite him out
to the summerhouse tonight</i>

619
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,926
<i>so we can talk
about you more.</i>

620
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,807
<i>I wish I could
put my arms around you.</i>

621
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,730
<i>When you get out
of this jacket, you can.</i>

622
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,981
Hi, guys.
Hi, coach.

623
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,562
Reg.

624
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,443
<i>I sold your car.</i>

625
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:27,159
<i>My 2602?
Yes.</i>

626
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,998
<i>But that was my car!</i>

627
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,076
<i>Alex, don't you remember?</i>

628
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,584
<i>When you had the amnesia,
you gave me power of attorney.</i>

629
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:40,882
<i>I'd forgotten.</i>

630
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:44,177
That cunt is no good.
Nice talk.

631
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:46,596
<i>I've botched up
everything, haven't I?</i>

632
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,514
She do that on purpose
to make him crazy

633
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,590
so he don't know
what he's doing.

634
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,018
<i>Cynthia Pierce is having an
affair with Carl Barton.</i>

635
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,436
She's lying to him.

636
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:57,732
<i>Oh, Alex,
you mustn't be weak.</i>

637
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,192
I don't believe this. I don't
frigging believe this!

638
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:04,693
Hey. you guys, listen.

639
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,400
"Chiefs Sought by Florida

640
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,532
Come on, Dave! Listen, Johnny.
It's right here.

641
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:13,364
J.G., Jimmy, come over here.
Listen to this.

642
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:17,123
"Unidentified but reliable sources

643
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,501

It's right there. Look!

647
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:29,882
I don't believe that.
Dickie Dunn wrote this.

648
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,184
It's gotta be true.
That's fantastic!

649
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,681
Florida!

650
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:37,935
What sucker would buy the Chiefs?
Jealous, big guy?

651
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:40,893
Your mother should've
bought you skates!

652
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:46,277
<i>Cut off my balls
I'll be skating in Florida</i>

653
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:50,201
We're gonna miss you guys. Here's to
the sap that would buy the Chiefs.

654
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,495
Hell! Here's to
the Sunshine State!

655
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:57,292
Here's to all that
gorgeous snatch in F-L-A.

<i>Guess who?</i>

657
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:21,937
What's wrong, Reg?

658
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:23,894
Oh, nothing.

659
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,775
You got an expression
of sadness on your face.

660
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,822
I guess this is
my last season.

661
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,491
No, it's not.
We're being bought.

662
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,614
You get to be my age, you
gotta think about retiring.

663
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,536
I know all the other teams
laugh at me.

664
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:38,534
That's not true. They do.
I hear them every game.

665
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:42,462
They're just saying that to get you upset.
it doesn't mean anything.

666
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,629
Thanks, kid.
Maybe you're right.

667
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,729
Drouin, open
your fucking eyes!

668
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:13,364
Tough news, Barclay. Sorry.
What fucking news?

669
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:18,498
Minnesota dropped ya.
It's in Hockey News.
I'll save it for ya.

670
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:21,042
I got a contract!

671
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:23,336
C'mon, let's go! Let's go!

672
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:27,587
You know what your problem is?
You're too fucking old
to play this game.

673
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:29,959
Take that sentence back!

674
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,851
Too much too soon.

675
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,983
Guys, hold it! Hold it!

676
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:54,283
That's it. Hold it!
Let's go!

677
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:06,417
Dave, hold it steady.
You're making me miss.

678
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:09,123
You got him, Dave!

679
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:13,053
That's crap. Did you hear what he said?
He shouldn't have said what he said.

680
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,050
You don't say stuff like that
when you're on the ice.

681
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,097
Let's win the frigging game.

682
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:19,892
We are winning the frigging game!
You goon!

683
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:25,269
You wanna say some more?
Yeah, yeah!
You ugly bastard.

684
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:34,820
Yeah! Yeah! Get him!

685
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:40,913
We were there. We saw it
with our own eyes!

686
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:45,167
Dave. Damn lard-ass.

687
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:48,208
Barclay Donaldson jumped us.
Sure did.

688
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:51,587
Gloves off, stick down, no warning.
He challenged the Chiefs!

689
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,839
Called us names!
He called us names!

690
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:59,808
But Dave was there.
Dave's a killer!

691
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,179
Dave's a mess.

692
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:04,353
Okay, but Dave's out.

693
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,435
Who's gonna take his place?
ls the answer Jesus?

694
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:17,367
Okay, guys, show us
what you got.

695
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,368
God save us.

696
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:13,252
Kill the bastard!

697
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:21,881
I do not believe
my frigging eyes.

698
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,275
These guys
are a fucking disgrace.

699
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:46,498
I'm telling you, Broom County is
visibly upset by this display.

700
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:50,952
Come on down. Bring the kids!
We got entertainment for
the whole family.

701
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:11,560
There goes Jeff Hanson into the corner.
I think it's Jeff. No, it's Jack.

702
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,562
It's 17.
I'll check that later.

703
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,894
He puts a crushing check
on him on the boards.

704
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,899
Things are really going on
out there now.

705
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:21,824
Steve is in front of the net.
I think that's Steve.
Yeah, it is Steve.

706
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:40,085
I think that was Jack.
Well, it was Jeff or Jack.

707
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,919
These brothers
are stomping all over the...

708
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,549
Hold it!

709
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:48,176
You, out!
What?

710
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:50,682
You, out!
What for?

711
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:55,938
You, out! No, no!
We're fucking robbed!

712
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:58,728
Get your eyes examined,
you idiot!

713
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:01,189
What were you doing anyway?
They're all gone!

714
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:04,116
No, no. It's self-defense,
for Chrissake.

715
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,943
How much do you
expect a man to take?

716
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,118
Don't come near me!

717
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,993
What are you running here?
A goddamn dance floor?

718
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,057
Open it.

719
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,561
Son?

720
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:44,782
Joe, who own the Chiefs?
Owns! Owns!

721
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:47,155
Owns! Owns!

722
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,577
I don't know.

723
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:51,701
Thanks.

724
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,501
Okay.

725
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:06,713
What?
He don't know.

726
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,677
How'd you ask him?
I say, "Who own the Chiefs?"

727
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:14,144
What'd he say? For Chrissake!
Owns! Owns!

728
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,019
I don't care who own
the Chiefs. I hate it here.

729
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,816
Make me sick, my allergy.
Puke every time.

730
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:21,894
Like that. Puke!

731
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,696
You're a goalie. You're
supposed to be like that.

732
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:29,403
Somebody own the Chiefs.
We go to Florida,
and I get the money!

733
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,837
That's nice.

734
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:52,884
I don't like the way they cover
theirjugs all up with the feathers.

735
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,095
They are so beautiful.

736
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:03,694
They oughta cut the costume
a little higher in the thigh
so you can see more ass.

737
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,488
You make me sick
when you speak, Morris.

738
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:09,867
This isn't art.
This is sex!

739
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,124
Ogilthorpe fucked her,
you know.

740
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:28,427
Yeah, it's true! I heard it
from a couple of guys.

741
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,129
Ogilthorpe
fucked the last girl

742
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,135
on the pinwheel
of the Ice Stravaganza.

743
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:33,386
That's her there.

744
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,933
Jesus Christ.

745
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:46,236
Get your butt in gear,
for the love of Mike!

746
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:53,198
Slow down the main line.
Going too fast.

747
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,596
You gals like skating, huh?
Sure.

748
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:25,651
I mean, dressed as bluebirds with all
them feathers on, racing around the ice!

749
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:29,489
You should talk. Well, I
just asked outta curiosity.

750
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,565
I like to see
how the other half lives.

751
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:35,153
Renee, I like to skate too,
but the "hair" is rotten here.

752
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:38,409
Hair?
Yeah, the hair.

753
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,617
Air!
It make me sick.

754
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:45,000
Your face is a mess.
I got cut in a fight, see.

755
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,877
It looks sort of cute.

756
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:50,050
Are you a fighter?
Nah, I'm a lover.

757
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,388
Is your team any good?

758
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:05,315
No. In fact we're so bad
that we're disbanding.

759
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:07,814
What about Florida,
eh,Reg?

760
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,816
We gotta win.

761
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:13,525
We won three games in a row.
Yeah, we're on a roll!

762
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,029
We're gonna win.

763
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:18,204
How's Oggie Ogilthorpe?
Who?

764
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,656
Oggie Ogilthorpe.
You know old Oggie.

765
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:24,001
Oggie. AHERN: Think he's
all he's cracked up to be?

766
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:25,794
Is he a nice guy?

767
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:27,880
I'll be right back.

768
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:35,550
Reg, you're really doing great!
You got them going!

769
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,347
Yeah, you betcha!

770
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,681
Hey, coach!
How ya doing there?

771
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:53,322
Son of a bitch!

772
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:05,910
Where the hell
did all this beer come from?

773
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:08,496
From the owner.
The owner?

774
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,708
Yeah.
How's his family, Reg?

775
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,418
He told me to tell you he's
really glad that we're winning.

776
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,004
It's gonna make it easier
to close that Florida deal.

777
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,215
- You find the guy's name?
- Oh, yeah.

778
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:22,472
He's a neat guy.
Looking to get us bonuses.

779
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:25,020
- That's good news, eh?
- Yeah!

780
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,644
What?
Beats me.

781
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:40,702
What the fuck is that?

782
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,162
Hey!

783
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,663
Where? Oh, yeah!

784
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:55,467
Hey, I think
you're wonderful!

785
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,967
We thought it'd be a big surprise.
It's wonderful!

786
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:05,223
You look like my mother!
You're beautiful!

787
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,438
Yea, Billy!

788
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:16,321
Hey, Eddie!
It's me, Reg. How are you?

789
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,742
Oh, Jesus, we're kicking
the shit out of everybody.

790
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:22,946
We're unbeatable! Listen,
I got a favor to ask ya.

791
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:26,157
Yeah. Remember Francine?

792
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:30,624
All together in one room!
Why not?

793
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,545
My ex-wife.

794
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:35,841
Yeah, the pretty one.
Has she been in there?

795
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:38,089
Four to a room!
We're the Chiefs!

796
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,512
It's against our policy.
Bullshit!

797
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:43,340
A couple tickets in it
for ya. Which bar?

798
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:48,767
Wait a minute. Hold it.
Everybody's gone bananas in here.

799
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,855
They convicted Ogilthorpe.

800
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:58,690
Help me. Get the manager.
Somebody, help me.

801
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,776
Eddie, listen, this guy she was
with, what'd he look like?

802
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:05,409
It's their rink, it's their ice
and it's their fucking town.

803
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,790
But tonight
we got our fans with us!

804
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:11,661
They spent their own dough to get
here, and they came here to see us!

805
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:14,296
All right, let's show them
what we got, guys!

806
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,715
Get out there on the ice and
let them know you're there.

807
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,714
Get that fucking stick in their side.
Let them know you're there!

808
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,512
Get that lumber in his teeth.
Let them know you're there!

809
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:24,386
Bleed all over them.
Let them know you're there.

810
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:27,263
Give them a good warm-up, Denis.
Come on, fellas!

811
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:30,771
Good game tonight, guys.
Let's go.

812
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:38,772
<i>The Peterboro Patriots
versus the Charlestown Chiefs.</i>

813
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:41,528
<i>Brought to you by
Sheehan's Rustproofing.</i>

814
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,447
<i>The Chiefs have just come out on
the ice for a warm-up period.</i>

815
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:47,154
<i>They're about to try for
their fifth consecutive win.</i>

816
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,865
<i>They're getting a good round of
applause from their own booster club</i>

817
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:53,623
<i>who have traveled from Charlestown
to be here in Peterboro tonight.</i>

818
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:30,827
<i>There's no
one to stop it because there
are no officials on the ice.</i>

819
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:33,455
<i>What has come over
the Charlestown Chiefs?</i>

820
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:46,506
<i>And the rockets' red glare</i>

821
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:51,014
<i>The bombs bursting in air</i>

822
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:56,145
<i>Gave proof through the night</i>

823
00:57:56,223 --> 00:58:01,195
<i>That our flag was
still there</i>

824
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,896
Got my eye
on the three of you.

825
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,277
You pull one thing,
you're outta this game.

826
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:07,075
I run a clean game here. I have
any trouble, I'll suspend ya!

827
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,869
I'm listening
to the fucking song!

828
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:13,119
Yet wave

829
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:19,422
<i>O'er the land of the free</i>

830
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,840
No, no, no.

831
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:25,173
To Mrs. Reggie
Dunlop from Reggie Dunlop.

832
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:26,504
Collect.

833
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:32,768
Well, make it station to... Operator,
I'll pay for the call here.

834
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:38,390
Hey, Walt!
What are you doing?

835
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,475
Making it look mean!

836
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,820
Atta boy, Walt.

837
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:47,157
Honey? We won last night!

838
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:50,361
Yeah, we won. I got a good
winning streak go...

839
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:52,408
Who is this?

840
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:54,865
Hello?

841
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,043
Shit!

842
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,210
<i>Met a little girl</i>

843
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:08,295
<i>Her name was June</i>

844
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:12,633
<i>A little bit south
of Saskatoon</i>

845
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:17,806
<i>Me and Junie Mae
we got on fine</i>

846
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:20,979
<i>Till I had to move on
down the line</i>

847
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:22,184
Gin.

848
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:26,314
Eight.

849
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:31,652
Hey, Reg?
Yeah?

850
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,080
I think I'm gonna
change my name.

851
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:39,752
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. "Killer."

852
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,880
That's got
a nice ring to it.

853
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:45,833
Yeah.

854
00:59:55,759 --> 01:00:00,765
I'm not gonna do it. I'm not
gonna goon it up for ya.

855
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:01,939
No?

856
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:04,522
Nope.

857
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:07,988
I'll bench ya.

858
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,404
I'll take my chances.

859
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:27,249
Pick up the boosters!

860
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:29,801
Pull over, Walt.

861
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:33,380
Let the girls in here with us.
Come on, Walt, pull over.

862
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,720
Great.

863
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,993
My husband'll kill me
if he finds out.

864
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:08,924
Their bus is coming up the street!
They're coming!

865
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:13,591
We don't
need you here!

866
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:17,679
There's no room in sports
for people like you!

867
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,430
Get outta town!

868
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:41,323
<i>We're at seven, one.
There's the face-off.</i>

869
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,793
<i>Charlestown Chiefs seem to be
coming down ice with the puck!</i>

870
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:52,759
Kill those Hanson creeps!

871
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:01,601
You goons can't skate!

872
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:05,309
<i>We like to see an old-fashioned
brand of hockey played here.</i>

873
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:08,483
You're a bunch of animals,
you Hanson apes!

874
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:20,703
Come on!

875
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:24,791
Get outta town, four-eyes!

876
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:45,137
Is this the guy?
Yeah, that's him!

877
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:47,481
No, he's over there!

878
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,696
<i>Look at that!
You can't see. I'm on radio.</i>

879
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:01,244
No, not him! That's the one!

880
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:04,615
Go fuck a moose, Froggy!

881
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:08,828
Think we should get into this?
Just a thought.

882
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:11,455
It wasn't me!

883
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:13,882
No, Jeff,
it's the other guy!

884
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:21,882
Do you think the old folks in
Florida are gonna like these guys?

885
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:24,889
I don't believe a word
of that Florida shit.

886
01:03:25,093 --> 01:03:29,143
<i>Fans are standing up to them. Security
guards are standing up to them.</i>

887
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:32,021
<i>The peanut vendors
are standing up to them!</i>

888
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,899
<i>And, by God, if I could get down
there, I 'd be standing up to them!</i>

889
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:48,617
What hit ya? An object
right in the face!

890
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,998
I know, but what was it?
I don't know.

891
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,330
Key chain. You know,
car keys, house keys.

892
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:55,165
Keys to the camper?

893
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,592
Hi, guys.
The Hansons.

894
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:08,766
Hey, guys?

895
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,689
Put the fucking bus in gear. The
cops have come for the Hansons.

896
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:13,187
The cops?

897
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,189
How many are out there?

898
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:20,274
The Hansons.

899
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,032
I throw up my hands.

900
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,534
I can't control them anymore.
They gotta be punished.

901
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:30,788
Will you do me a favor
and put them behind bars?

902
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,964
They're looking for you guys. There's
gotta be some misunderstanding.

903
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:40,677
Tell them to come and get us.
They don't wanna risk it.

904
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,388
Look at his lip.

905
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:47,638
Somebody threw a fucking tire chain.
Hit him in the mouth!

906
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:50,562
Scratches, made
by human fingernails!

907
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:53,140
This kid has taken
a savage beating.

908
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:57,276
Fellas, there are six of them
out there for us!

909
01:04:57,352 --> 01:04:59,730
They're gonna put you in the
same jail with Ogilthorpe.

910
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:01,941
Come on, you guys.

911
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,402
They'll let you make
one phone call.

912
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:07,908
They book you
and then give you a dime,

913
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,364
and they let you make
one phone call.

914
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:10,744
Call the pizza man!

915
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:13,418
Why don't you call
a massage parlor?

916
01:05:15,203 --> 01:05:17,001
Guys, we'll see you later.
Bye.

917
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,081
Save me
a piece of pizza.

918
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,917
Don't eat my watermelon sticks.
They're all mine.

919
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,378
Don't admit to nothing,
you guys!

920
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:25,847
Dickie, it's me, Reg.

921
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:29,260
They're putting the Hansons
away on a trumped-up charge.

922
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:32,642
Someone threw a monkey wrench.
Hit Jeff in the face.

923
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,526
No, they were defending the honor
of Charlestown at the time.

924
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:41,230
The boosters are behind us
a hundred percent.

925
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,820
Dickie, have you
seen Francine?

926
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:47,448
Sergeant, you will never meet
a greater champion

927
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:49,404
of the pure sport of hockey
than me.

928
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,489
Sergeant, I knew Eddie Shore

929
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:53,951
and Toe Blake...
You guys back there?

930
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:57,913
Peterboro lost tonight, so <i>as</i> of
right now we're in the play-offs!

931
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:03,465
I would like to see the bail
just a little more reasonable.

932
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:06,922
Joe, hurry it up. I wanna go home.
Sergeant, when is the trial?

933
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:09,508
You can't leave those guys in there.
They're folk heroes!

934
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:13,141
They're criminals. Most folk
heroes started out as criminals.

935
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:17,065
You're asking an exorbitant sum.
Joe, I got it here.

936
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:20,902
How much these goons gonna cost?
$250 for each.

937
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:23,772
This young fella
is in a hurry

938
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:26,859
because he's got the prettiest
wife waiting at home.

939
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:29,490
But she ain't happy.
Sam, let them out.

940
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:31,989
I want a receipt.

941
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:34,073
Hey, hey, there!

942
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:36,626
Hey, coach.
We got to keep our bracelets!

943
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:39,120
Thanks a lot, Sarge.

944
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:41,915
Let's get on the bus.

945
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,420
Look at that.

946
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:47,967
The boys and I want you to
have this as a little memento.

947
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:51,550
It's a Chiefs' key ring.
You can't buy these in stores.

948
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:58,936
Guys, we'll party in there!

949
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:16,534
Aren't those Hansons
something?

950
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:20,958
They're sort of funny looking.
Real funny looking.

951
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,664
They're probably
real good guys.

952
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:25,713
Underneath. They couldn't
be <i>as</i> dumb as they look.

953
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:28,921
Yes, they could.
They're just goons.

954
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:33,216
Johnny doesn't care
for the fighting.
He told me so.

955
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:35,142
That's bullshit.

956
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:45,357
If we weren't so far
below sea level,

957
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:48,280
the radio reception here
would be much better.

958
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:54,742
I'm getting tipsy! I've been
shitfaced for the past week.

959
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:57,791
I only drink
in the afternoon.

960
01:07:57,865 --> 01:08:01,790
Or before a game...
or when Johnny's away.

961
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:03,375
Me too.

962
01:08:04,539 --> 01:08:08,339
If I'm not tight, I can't stand it.
That's terrible!

963
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:17,268
<i>It's sad, so sad
So sad</i>

964
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:20,813
<i>It's a sad, sad situation</i>

965
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:25,482
<i>And it's gettin'
more and more absurd</i>

966
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:31,199
<i>It's sad, so sad
So sad</i>

967
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:36,283
<i>Why can't we talk it over?</i>

968
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:39,161
<i>Oh, it seems to me</i>

969
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:44,417
<i>That sorry seems
to be the hardest word</i>

970
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:26,166
How ya doing, Lil?
Hey, Johnny.

971
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:40,180
Hey... Lil? Lil!

972
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:50,569
Hiya! Let's go someplace.
Ya know the Aces?

973
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:52,067
Bully!
Can the heavy stuff.

974
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:55,362
Let's start something.
Get the fuck out,
I'm going home!

975
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:58,285
Oh, yeah?
Where's Braden going?

976
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:08,501
I got a better idea.
Let's die in bed.
You're nuts.

977
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:14,215
Jesus. You really married a weirdo.
He don't run with the traffic.

978
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:17,046
Speaking of weirdos!
Me? I'm normal.

979
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:19,849
Yeah? Well,
then normal is fucked.

980
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,926
How come you talk dirty?

981
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:25,889
'Cause my family has money.

982
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,146
Leave him.

983
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:34,481
My wife left me.
I was driving her crazy!

984
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:37,951
All she could do
was drink and cry like you.

985
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,743
Every time she sees me,
it drives me nuts

986
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:44,745
'cause I know
she's asking herself,

987
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:47,498
"How'd I get mixed up
with a bum like him?"

988
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:49,830
Good question!
Oh, yeah?

989
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:51,915
Next year you'll be
asking yourself

990
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:53,921
the same question
about Braden!

991
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,048
He treats you like shit.

992
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,349
He told me the only reason
you paid attention to me

993
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,927
was to make him crazy
so he'd fight.

994
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:06,559
Yeah! That's part of it.

995
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:10,601
But mainly it's because
I think you're a champ.

996
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:13,232
Only you gotta stop
killing yourself.

997
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:26,248
My place.
That's a coincidence.

998
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:28,455
Get out!

999
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:31,458
Hey, you gotta
roll with it, kid.

1000
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:34,837
Use your imagination.
That's what I've been doing.

1001
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:38,045
I can get ya straight.
Beat it.

1002
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:43,974
Well, I'll see you later.

1003
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:04,363
Hi, guys. I'm proud of ya.
They're talking about you
in the streets!

1004
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:08,287
Coach, you want a white avenger?
Nah. Gimme a cup of coffee.

1005
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:10,209
That was a nice tribute
to the guys, Dickie.

1006
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:13,254
I tried to capture the
spirit of the thing. Yeah.

1007
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:16,173
Hey, guys. This is Dickie Dunn.
He wrote the article on ya.

1008
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:17,466
Hi, guys. Nice to meet ya.

1009
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:20,591
I was trying to capture
the spirit of the thing.

1010
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:24,424
Hi, GUYS-
Hi, GUYS-

1011
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:25,633
Hi, coach.

1012
01:12:31,389 --> 01:12:34,108
Hey, come out and see
the game tonight.
Compliments of the Chiefs.

1013
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:35,810
Thanks, Reggie.
You too.

1014
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:38,609
Free tickets! Sure,
spread them around, guys.

1015
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:43,026
Compliments of the Chiefs.
Thanks, Reggie.

1016
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:47,910
You really taught that guy
a lesson last night.
He was sensational!

1017
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:51,288
I guess that was a big fight.
Are you in pain?

1018
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:54,792
No, it hurt like hell!
Oh, you poor thing.

1019
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:58,625
Look, I'll make you
a double dose of this stuff

1020
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:01,336
and you won't feel anything.
Good.

1021
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:06,391
What happened to you? He got
that in the fight last night.

1022
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:10,265
That is a very deep cut.

1023
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:12,017
Will you be
at the game?

1024
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:15,942
If I see you in the stands, it
make me feel better... a little.

1025
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:27,866
Hey, Killer!
Get them tonight!

1026
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:31,456
Fucking wearing me out.

1027
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:54,731
Reggie!
Hiya, honey! How are ya?

1028
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:57,058
You look
a thousand years old.

1029
01:13:57,975 --> 01:13:59,443
It was along bus ride.

1030
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:01,816
Did you listen to the
game last night?
Of course not.

1031
01:14:01,896 --> 01:14:04,365
We got a whole new attitude.
It's bringing us success!

1032
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,612
Any fool can fight.

1033
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:06,943
No, I swear to ya.

1034
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:08,824
The Chiefs are gonna be
sitting pretty in Florida

1035
01:14:08,903 --> 01:14:11,406
when this town's
a stinking memory.

1036
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:17,582
I've personally been talking
to the owner,

1037
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:19,710
which is why I've been
too busy to call you.

1038
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:22,417
Every waking hour, I'm on
the phone making deals...

1039
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,219
Reggie, I'm moving.
What?

1040
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:27,255
To Long Island.

1041
01:14:27,338 --> 01:14:30,467
A gal who works in a shop
there has a space open.

1042
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:32,643
<i>Business here is just dead.</i>

1043
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:37,185
Are you really going?

1044
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:40,609
You know, we have to get
divorced one of these days.

1045
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:45,240
I mean, I could meet somebody.
You could meet somebody.

1046
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:46,315
Yeah?

1047
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,902
Well, don't look so sad.

1048
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:59,420
It's gonna be a big one!
See those guys...

1049
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:03,090
Reggie, look, I'm late. I'll
write you when I get settled.

1050
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:09,305
Hey, I'll try to call you
before you go.

1051
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:21,439
It sucks! No, son, it looks
nice and it sells hockey.

1052
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:24,862
It ain't mean enough.
Put some blood in there.

1053
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:27,611
Show somebody getting hurt.
A groin injury!

1054
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:31,035
Put the map of Florida
in the background.
Get some tits in there.

1055
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:32,737
Put a "for sale" sign
on the bottom.

1056
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:37,075
I don't want any tits and I
don't want any "for sale" sign.

1057
01:15:43,831 --> 01:15:45,003
<i>Jesus.</i>

1058
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:49,922
Remember that great
Peterboro game in '68?

1059
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:52,089
Yeah. What about it?

1060
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:55,343
Jacky St. Pierre's wife
left him.

1061
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:59,313
It was snowing like hell before
we even got to the motel.

1062
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:00,689
Yeah.

1063
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,768
Jacky had a whole keg sent in.

1064
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:08,402
Poor Jacky. He had a future.
I told him to watch that
drunk driving!

1065
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:11,655
My God, Joe,
did we ever get shitfaced!

1066
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:13,407
And Jacky was running around
telling everybody

1067
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:16,205
he was gonna get Jill back
even if he had to beg her.

1068
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,577
I told him not to do that.

1069
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:21,911
Oh, I think he should've.
She was a dynamite broad.

1070
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:26,211
God did we get shitfaced.
I liked Jacky.

1071
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:30,177
Yeah, he could've been great.
Yeah.

1072
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:34,932
Remember I went
to your room afterwards

1073
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:37,556
and you were dressed
in chick's clothes?

1074
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:41,936
Yeah, you had on this
black bra with tassels.

1075
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:47,604
You were dancing in front of a mirror
with this zebra-skinned jock strap.

1076
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:51,441
Remember how I screamed at you
when you started coming on to me?

1077
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:55,574
I said, "Jesus, stop it. I'm
ashamed of ya." Damn you.

1078
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:59,119
I wanted to tell you
I forgot the whole thing.

1079
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:02,077
Years have passed now.
I'm sexually liberated.

1080
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,957
I don't care
who's a fag no more.

1081
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:07,336
I mean, who cares? It's natural.
It's all around us!

1082
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:11,677
Who's the owner, Joe?

1083
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:15,222
He's probably
calling Florida.

1084
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,925
See how the sale is going.

1085
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:20,807
I was in Florida once
on a southern tour

1086
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:22,980
where I met
this little redhead

1087
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:25,274
who's an underwater
specialist.

1088
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:29,233
<i>And the
first thing she says to me was,</i>

1089
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:31,480
"Come on out by the pool."

1090
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:36,070
So I went out, and she comes
leaping out of this cabana,

1091
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:40,076
wearing nothing but this
little see-through wet suit.

1092
01:17:41,532 --> 01:17:43,000
Reg, I want a chair
by the pool!

1093
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:45,043
I want some snatch
by the pool.

1094
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:46,666
Reg, you want a coke?

1095
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:49,168
No, I can't. I'm taping an
interview at the station.

1096
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:51,797
They're playing it
at 4:00. Don't miss it.

1097
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:53,836
That was some road trip.

1098
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:56,968
Six straight wins and a whole
new rash of penalty minutes.

1099
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:58,890
We got
a whole new attitude.

1100
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:00,635
What about the Hanson brothers?
What about 'em?

1101
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:02,095
They're not just bullies?

1102
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:03,270
What do you mean,
"just bullies"?

1103
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:05,222
They scare the bejesus
outta everybody.

1104
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:07,229
Deliberately?

1105
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:10,562
I'd like the folks
to come down

1106
01:18:10,644 --> 01:18:14,194
and watch us cream them punks
from Syracuse.

1107
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:16,571
Anything new on the sale
of the Chiefs?

1108
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:20,951
I think the negotiations are,
you know, going pretty good.

1109
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:23,866
I have
a personal announcement.

1110
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:27,453
I'm placing a personal bounty
on the head of Tim McCracken.

1111
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:31,211
He's the coach and chief punk
on that Syracuse team.

1112
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:33,338
A bounty?
Yeah.

1113
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:34,760
A hundred bucks
of my own money

1114
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:38,430
for the first of my men
that nails that creep.

1115
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:41,555
That's 8:00
at the War Memorial.

1116
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:45,184
The Syracuse and the all-new
Charlestown Chiefs.

1117
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:47,390
Thanks, Reg.
Not to worry, kid.

1118
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:51,190
<i>I'm placing a personal
bounty on the head of Tim McCracken.</i>

1119
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:55,444
<i>He's the coach and chief punk
on that Syracuse team.</i>

1120
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:57,490
<i>A bounty?
Yeah.</i>

1121
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:58,909
<i>A hundred bucks
of my own money</i>

1122
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:02,158
<i>for the first of my men
that really nails...</i>

1123
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,528
Yeah?
Are you nuts?

1124
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:44,955
<i>Bullshit.
A bounty?</i>

1125
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:49,161
We could all end in the
clinker for this!
Big deal, Joe.

1126
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:53,043
You can't put a bounty on
a man's head! I just did.

1127
01:20:10,097 --> 01:20:11,269
Yeah?

1128
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:14,272
Reg, it's Killer.
Oh, hi, Killer.

1129
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:18,777
I want that $100. Well, you
gotta earn it, Killer.

1130
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:21,818
My attitude's right.
Okay, kid.

1131
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:44,591
In-fucking-credible!
Who is it?

1132
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:49,770
Yeah?

1133
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:56,819
Hi!
Oh, hi.

1134
01:20:57,895 --> 01:21:01,240
What's up? Oh, Jesus.

1135
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:03,735
Come on in.

1136
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:09,290
Well, I did it. You bet you did.
You did, you bet.

1137
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:13,586
The wedding presents my side gave.
Fifty-fifty, right?

1138
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:16,789
Can you get my clothes?
Yeah, sure.

1139
01:21:18,624 --> 01:21:20,672
Jesus, did you
write him a note?

1140
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:24,839
Oh, do you think I should've?
I don't know.

1141
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:28,635
He's gonna think
the worst.

1142
01:21:31,762 --> 01:21:34,766
Hey, Lily, we're gonna have a ball!
We are?

1143
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:38,610
Except right now
I gotta take a nap.

1144
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:42,531
I put a bounty on this guy's head.
If I don't get some shut...

1145
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:50,205
If I don't get some shut-eye, I'm gonna
get murdered out there on the ice.

1146
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:53,204
Otherwise, you know, I would've
given you a night on the town.

1147
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:54,956
We could've gone
to the Aces.

1148
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:57,208
She won't mind.
She's great to sleep with.

1149
01:21:57,287 --> 01:21:59,335
Ned sleeps with her
before every game.

1150
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:02,009
Her breathing makes him
feel more secure.

1151
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,428
Reg, I'm gonna get
a grip on myself,

1152
01:22:04,503 --> 01:22:06,972
start using my imagination,
go with the traffic.

1153
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:11,261
I've been going about this all wrong!
I probably am terrific.

1154
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:13,345
You want some spaghetti?

1155
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:15,396
Reg?

1156
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:33,248
Run the siren.
What?

1157
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:35,667
Run the goddamn siren.
I'm paying for it.

1158
01:22:35,742 --> 01:22:38,040
Let 'em know there's
gonna be blood in there.

1159
01:22:38,162 --> 01:22:42,133
I can circle, but it's
gonna cost you more.
For Chrissake!

1160
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:44,881
There.

1161
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,959
Don't ever play
<i>Lady of Spain</i> again!

1162
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:23,670
Jesus Christ.

1163
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:37,646
Hey, McCracken!

1164
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:41,771
Dunlop, you suck cock.
All I can get.

1165
01:23:56,615 --> 01:23:57,958
<i>One hundred dollar bounty</i>

1166
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:01,253
<i>on the head of famed Syracuse
stickman, Tim McCracken.</i>

1167
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:05,708
<i>McCracken, also known as Dr. Hook for
his scalp-like prowess with the stick,</i>

1168
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:09,512
<i>has been known to carve a man's eye
out with the flick of the wrist.</i>

1169
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:14,220
<i>There's a carnival-like
atmosphere here tonight.</i>

1170
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:17,974
<i>The crowd has gathered.
You can feel it.
There's an air of expectancy.</i>

1171
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,266
<i>Syracuse skating out now.</i>

1172
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:25,899
<i>We're looking forward
to a real contest tonight.</i>

1173
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:28,106
<i>We'll be ready to face off
at the middle circle.</i>

1174
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:31,362
The referee <i>is</i> ready to go.
The linesmen for tonight...

1175
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:44,963
Go, Chiefs, go!
Go, Chiefs, go!

1176
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:53,589
A hundred bucks says you're
gonna crack my skull, huh?

1177
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:56,175
I wouldn't crack your knuckles
for a hundred bucks.

1178
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:57,259
So he's bluffing?

1179
01:24:57,342 --> 01:24:59,344
Somebody's gonna kill you,
you dumb son of a bitch.

1180
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:01,351
But it's not gonna be me.

1181
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:31,802
Good pass!

1182
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:39,560
Come on, Ned, hit him!
What's the matter with you?
You're a Chief!

1183
01:25:39,635 --> 01:25:40,887
Come on!

1184
01:25:55,734 --> 01:25:58,237
You son of a bitch!
Get over here!

1185
01:25:58,403 --> 01:26:01,532
You chicken-shit, yellow-belly...
I just scored a goal!

1186
01:26:02,032 --> 01:26:03,500
They don't want you
to score goals.

1187
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:05,953
They want blood.
They're booing you.

1188
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:08,455
Go get 'em, Killer!

1189
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:14,256
Come on, you son of a bitch!
Come on!

1190
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:18,716
Come on, Killer. We win
'cause I score goals.

1191
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:21,302
Kiss my ass! We win
'cause I make 'em crazy!

1192
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:27,064
Come on, nail him!

1193
01:26:27,099 --> 01:26:30,694
You don't make me crazy. I
will, 'cause you're benched!

1194
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:33,989
You want ice time, tell me when
you want to play it my way.

1195
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:37,576
You're the biggest pussy in the league.
That's right! I like pussy!

1196
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:41,246
Yeah? That's not what I hear
from your wife. I hear...

1197
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:56,215
Go get him, Killer!

1198
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:14,442
Real old-fashioned guts

1199
01:27:14,521 --> 01:27:16,569
for Dave "Killer" Carlson
to jump into that fight

1200
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:18,571
with Tim "Dr. Hook" McCracken.

1201
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:21,199
Ned Braden's come
into the booth.

1202
01:27:21,278 --> 01:27:23,997
<i>I noticed a
discussion with Reg Dun/op.</i>

1203
01:27:24,114 --> 01:27:28,415
Have you been benched?
Yes, a first in my
professional career.

1204
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:30,336
Why is that?
I won't fight.

1205
01:27:30,454 --> 01:27:34,334
You could play if you fought.
Let's just say I'm chicken-shit.

1206
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:36,669
<i>Ned, tell me.
Why would someone</i>

1207
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:38,629
with your family background
and education

1208
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:41,090
still be playing hockey?
I hate my father.

1209
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:43,426
I'm also having
a lot of problems at home.

1210
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:45,678
You are? I just said
I was, didn't I?

1211
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:47,763
They're sexual problems.
I'm perverse.

1212
01:27:47,846 --> 01:27:50,645
<i>I come here to get
away from my wife!
Holy shit!</i>

1213
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:51,771
This is Jim Carr...

1214
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:54,103
We fight day and night.
She wants me to quit hockey.

1215
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:02,616
You may have noticed, she's the only
good-looking piece of ass in Charlestown.

1216
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:04,116
She also has
a drinking problem.

1217
01:28:04,196 --> 01:28:06,369
At this moment,
I have no idea where she is.

1218
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:09,452
Gimme that goddamn mike!
Why do you wear that rug?

1219
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:13,330
It's sensationally ugly!
You're going bald!

1220
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:16,883
Can't you face up to that? At least
I'm not chicken-shit like you!

1221
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:21,088
What you're hearing is the truth.
Jim Carr got angry!

1222
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:25,475
Joe McGrath here.
The boys like to horse around.

1223
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:28,266
Chicken-shit bastard.
Sawed-off old fart!

1224
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:32,141
I may be bald, but I'm not chicken-shit.
I wanna talk about violence.

1225
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:35,068
Chick, chick, chick!
Gimme that!

1226
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:38,397
Son! Son! Son!

1227
01:28:48,907 --> 01:28:50,250
Hey. Billy!

1228
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:53,624
Well, you're gonna
be set, Lily.

1229
01:28:53,703 --> 01:28:57,583
Taking your destiny by the throat.
You're in the driver's seat.

1230
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:01,928
You're not having second
thoughts about this, are you?

1231
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:05,177
Sometimes I think I get it, and
sometimes I think it's horseshit!

1232
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:09,637
To doubt is human. You stick with Reg.
I'm on a roll.

1233
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:14,350
Bye, Francine. Come back and see us.
I will. Thank you.

1234
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:20,272
You're gonna need
another 10 or 15 minutes.

1235
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:27,161
Hiya!
Hi.

1236
01:29:27,237 --> 01:29:29,956
This is Lily Braden,
Ned Braden's wife.

1237
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:33,790
Actually,
she's on waivers.

1238
01:29:33,869 --> 01:29:36,042
She's in the market
for a perm.

1239
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:39,216
I said, "There's no one
better than 0l' Francine."

1240
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:42,795
Well, I don't think...
The works! I'm buying.

1241
01:29:42,878 --> 01:29:45,802
I'll pay you back tomorrow.
No, that's not the problem.

1242
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:47,804
See, the problem is...

1243
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:51,890
I never laid a hand on her.
She's just a kid.

1244
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:54,644
It's a pathetic story.
It's pathetic.

1245
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:57,191
You look terrific.

1246
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:02,485
Be careful, girls.

1247
01:30:07,986 --> 01:30:11,411
<i>There's TV Radio Mirror
or Modern Screen.
You were married to him?</i>

1248
01:30:11,489 --> 01:30:14,493
For about a hundred years,
but it's all over.

1249
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:17,580
He's completely
off his rocker.

1250
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:21,341
I left my husband, too.
Really?

1251
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:24,260
I'm only halfway out the revolving door.
You know what I mean?

1252
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:25,963
Oh, it's lousy at first.

1253
01:30:26,046 --> 01:30:29,095
You think you're dying,
but then it's fabulous!

1254
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:31,597
You become a new woman!
Yeah.

1255
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:35,643
Reggie told me you'd gotten
terrific since you left him.

1256
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:38,684
He said that?

1257
01:30:42,228 --> 01:30:44,822
Well, you know what you
have to do for yourself?

1258
01:30:44,898 --> 01:30:47,276
You have to get out there
and circulate.

1259
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:51,660
You can't sink into it.
You have to get out there
on the firing line.

1260
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:55,910
Oh, my God! No, no, no.
Really. It's not bad.

1261
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:59,709
Look. If you did
your cheekbones better,

1262
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:03,041
you could look like Cher.

1263
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:48,845
Take this in the house.
Can you handle it?

1264
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,342
Hello there.

1265
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:55,098
I'm Reggie Dunlop of the Chiefs.
I came to see your husband.

1266
01:31:55,176 --> 01:31:58,771
Yes? I'm Anita McCambridge.
How do you do?

1267
01:31:58,847 --> 01:32:01,521
Think you can help with these?
Yeah.

1268
01:32:01,599 --> 01:32:02,976
Mom, I'm late.
I gotta go.

1269
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:04,561
Michael, you're gonna stay
in the yard,

1270
01:32:04,644 --> 01:32:07,773
put your jacket on,
and carry one of these in.

1271
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:12,407
Where's your husband?
He's in puppy heaven.

1272
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:18,116
I own the Chiefs.

1273
01:32:20,452 --> 01:32:21,749
This way.

1274
01:32:33,048 --> 01:32:36,518
What can I get you to drink?
Canadian Club and water.

1275
01:32:38,803 --> 01:32:41,306
Nice place you've got here.
Thanks.

1276
01:32:43,892 --> 01:32:46,987
To tell the truth,
Mrs. McCambridge... Anita.

1277
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:52,192
Yeah, Anita.

1278
01:32:53,943 --> 01:32:58,073
You know, we all read about the
possibility of a sale...in Florida.

1279
01:32:58,156 --> 01:33:01,956
And the guys are getting anxious
to find out what's going on.

1280
01:33:03,286 --> 01:33:05,709
I guess
I'm their representative.

1281
01:33:07,624 --> 01:33:11,470
We've been doing real good. My
accountant is certainly pleased.

1282
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:14,423
Oh. How is the sale going?

1283
01:33:16,716 --> 01:33:17,842
Fine.

1284
01:33:19,803 --> 01:33:21,350
Oh. Good.

1285
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:24,816
You think you're gonna like Florida?
Yeah.

1286
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:33,442
Oh, you are very clever.
What?

1287
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:37,405
It's been so much fun waiting to
see what you're gonna do next.

1288
01:33:37,487 --> 01:33:41,082
The articles in the
paper are very funny.
That sportswriter?

1289
01:33:41,783 --> 01:33:43,251
Dickie Dunn?
Dickie Dunn.

1290
01:33:43,326 --> 01:33:45,294
You've certainly
got his number.

1291
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:46,963
The radio interviews
are fantastic.

1292
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:50,508
And the Hanson brothers?
Oh, my God!

1293
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:52,881
Well, attendance
has quadrupled.

1294
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:55,635
Yes. lam in the black for the
first time in four years.

1295
01:33:55,713 --> 01:33:57,215
That's great.

1296
01:33:57,549 --> 01:34:00,598
I guess I owe that to you.
Thank you.

1297
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:03,351
You're welcome. So you can
sell us real easy then, huh?

1298
01:34:03,429 --> 01:34:06,683
I could probably get some
interest, yes. Oh, boy!

1299
01:34:06,766 --> 01:34:10,111
That's great!
That's just great, Anita!

1300
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:13,611
You know, for five months I've
been trying to prove to you,

1301
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:16,034
without ever really knowing
who you were,

1302
01:34:16,109 --> 01:34:20,455
that you were wrong and we could get
somebody interested in the Chiefs.

1303
01:34:21,948 --> 01:34:24,076
We could sew that thing
up tonight, you know.

1304
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:27,083
We oughta cream those guys.
That's terrific.

1305
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:30,674
But you have to understand that I
couldn't make enough of a profit

1306
01:34:30,748 --> 01:34:32,967
to have a sale
be worthwhile.

1307
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:38,424
My accountant tells me I'm better off
folding the team, taking a tax loss.

1308
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:43,394
You mean you could sell us,
but you won't?

1309
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:47,478
I could probably sell you,
but I can't.

1310
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:54,273
Well...

1311
01:34:55,773 --> 01:35:00,074
You know...
We're human beings, you know.

1312
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:07,123
I have to confess I've never let
the children watch a hockey game.

1313
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:12,006
I have a theory that children imitate
what they see on a TV screen.

1314
01:35:12,498 --> 01:35:15,251
If they see violence,
they'll become violent.

1315
01:35:15,335 --> 01:35:18,805
If they see someone stick up a
bank, they'll stick up a bank.

1316
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:21,133
Heroin. You name it.

1317
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:24,470
You're fucked!
What?

1318
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:26,475
You are totally fucked!

1319
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:30,896
You're garbage for letting
us go down the drain.

1320
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:32,443
Are you serious?

1321
01:35:32,518 --> 01:35:34,566
You could sell us. We're hot.

1322
01:35:34,646 --> 01:35:37,240
People go nuts for us.
You could find a buyer.

1323
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:40,410
I don't think
you understand finance.

1324
01:35:49,369 --> 01:35:51,542
You know, your son
looks like a fag to me.

1325
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:52,713
You better get married again,

1326
01:35:52,789 --> 01:35:54,962
'cause he's gonna wind up with
somebody's cock in his mouth

1327
01:35:55,041 --> 01:35:57,760
before you can say Jack Robinson.
How dare you!

1328
01:35:57,835 --> 01:35:59,337
How dare you!

1329
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:03,266
Our listeners
will be surprised to learn

1330
01:36:03,341 --> 01:36:05,764
that you're a very soft-spoken
young man, Killer.

1331
01:36:05,843 --> 01:36:07,265
Yes, I am.

1332
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:10,064
I was watching kids
play hockey the other day.

1333
01:36:10,139 --> 01:36:14,610
Five and six-year-olds, little mites.
One said, "I'm Killer Carlson."

1334
01:36:14,686 --> 01:36:18,156
He picked up his little stick
and creamed that other kid.

1335
01:36:18,231 --> 01:36:19,778
How do you feel about that?

1336
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:23,612
The way I see it, the kid
probably would've done it anyway.

1337
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:26,039
A bad upbringing
in the home or whatever.

1338
01:36:26,114 --> 01:36:27,457
That's interesting, Dave.

1339
01:36:27,532 --> 01:36:29,205
Could I be serious
for a minute?

1340
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:30,789
<i>By all means.</i>

1341
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:34,122
<i>I'd like to say that no matter
how the game turns out tonight,</i>

1342
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:37,960
<i>I owe all that I am
to our coach, Reg Dun/op.</i>

1343
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:40,170
<i>He's had the greatest
influence on me,</i>

1344
01:36:40,253 --> 01:36:42,756
<i>aside, of course,
from the Swami Baha,</i>

1345
01:36:42,839 --> 01:36:46,309
<i>whose positive thinking records
have been a tremendous help.</i>

1346
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:48,682
Positive thinking records?
Yeah, that's right.

1347
01:36:48,761 --> 01:36:51,310
You can get them
at any religious record store.

1348
01:36:51,389 --> 01:36:55,394
I know that thousands of people
in Charlestown have lost jobs

1349
01:36:55,476 --> 01:36:57,604
with the mill closing
and all.

1350
01:36:57,687 --> 01:37:01,112
I see 'em walking around the
streets depressed all the time.

1351
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:04,194
I want to say to all you
unemployed folks,

1352
01:37:04,277 --> 01:37:06,154
you can get a whole new
lease on life

1353
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:08,786
<i>with these records, nothing
will bother you anymore.</i>

1354
01:37:08,865 --> 01:37:12,620
<i>You can just go out and clobber the
next guy in your business life.</i>

1355
01:37:12,744 --> 01:37:14,917
<i>That's very inspirational, Dave.
Thanks.</i>

1356
01:37:14,996 --> 01:37:16,919
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

1357
01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:21,427
Jesus Christ,
what a fucking nightmare.

1358
01:37:55,953 --> 01:37:57,125
Braden!

1359
01:38:01,918 --> 01:38:02,965
Ned!

1360
01:38:04,837 --> 01:38:05,929
Hey!

1361
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:19,818
Kid.

1362
01:38:23,981 --> 01:38:26,075
Hey, come on back!

1363
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:30,451
You don't have to fight.
You can do whatever you want.
It's up to you!

1364
01:38:34,534 --> 01:38:38,004
You know, I've had it with
this show business crap too.

1365
01:38:39,497 --> 01:38:40,544
I don't know what hit me.

1366
01:38:40,623 --> 01:38:44,423
I'm driving up and I say to
myself, "Who cares about Florida?

1367
01:38:44,502 --> 01:38:48,006
"Screw the sale. It's probably
a bunch of crap anyway."

1368
01:38:49,549 --> 01:38:51,392
No, that's bullshit.

1369
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:52,851
Hey!

1370
01:38:54,554 --> 01:38:58,149
The team's history, kid.
There ain't no next year.

1371
01:38:58,224 --> 01:39:01,569
I'm tits up after this game,
no matter what happens.

1372
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:06,236
But I'll tell you one thing.

1373
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:10,157
We're gonna win that fucking
championship tonight.

1374
01:39:10,236 --> 01:39:12,455
But we're gonna win it
fair and square.

1375
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:15,534
Old-time hockey.
None of this wrestling shit.

1376
01:39:17,285 --> 01:39:18,832
You know, what the hell?
It's my last game.

1377
01:39:18,911 --> 01:39:22,040
I'm gonna go out with style.
Play it straight.

1378
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:28,054
I'd like to have you
there with me.

1379
01:39:38,347 --> 01:39:41,851
Oh, you know, Lily's been
staying at my place.

1380
01:39:41,934 --> 01:39:43,732
She's a terrific gal.

1381
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:50,527
We've been having
a hell of a time.

1382
01:40:03,664 --> 01:40:05,917
Hey, Reg!

1383
01:40:08,503 --> 01:40:11,347
Yeah, what do you want?
Want me to circle,
run in with stretchers?

1384
01:40:11,422 --> 01:40:14,096
Get out of here,
you goddamn parasite!

1385
01:40:14,592 --> 01:40:17,596
Get 'em, baby!
Get 'em!

1386
01:40:18,054 --> 01:40:20,022
This is Jim Carr.
Jeff Hanson,

1387
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:22,020
I can't tell you what
you've done for all of us,

1388
01:40:22,099 --> 01:40:24,193
the pleasure you've given us.
I'd like to ask you one question.

1389
01:40:24,268 --> 01:40:25,440
Win, lose or draw,

1390
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:29,070
this is the Chiefs' last game
before you leave Charlestown...

1391
01:40:29,148 --> 01:40:30,946
We're gonna
kill 'em tonight.

1392
01:40:31,025 --> 01:40:33,027
What do you mean,
Flood City?

1393
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:35,704
Never mind, Jeff. I guess
that's before your time.

1394
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:38,124
Hey, Reg Dunlop.
How about a statement?

1395
01:40:38,241 --> 01:40:40,369
Good game, fella.
Good luck tonight.
Get outta here.

1396
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:42,294
Reg Dunlop has
asked us to come back...

1397
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:44,964
Come on, girls!
Get out of here!

1398
01:40:46,916 --> 01:40:48,133
Come on.

1399
01:41:05,685 --> 01:41:06,982
No hit.

1400
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:21,705
The Chiefs are history, guys.
There ain't no Florida deal.

1401
01:41:21,784 --> 01:41:24,503
Come on, Reg.
What are you talking about?

1402
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:30,085
I just made that shit up. We're
deader than this stinking town.

1403
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:32,420
Hey! Dead history!

1404
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:35,723
I conned you guys.
I just lied to you.

1405
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:44,311
We were never anything but a
rich broads tax write-off.

1406
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:46,939
It's never made a fuck's bit of
difference whether we won or lost.

1407
01:41:47,018 --> 01:41:48,816
Nail 'em!
Kill 'em!

1408
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:53,278
We ain't been hockey players.
We've been clowns.

1409
01:41:53,733 --> 01:41:55,406
We've been goons!

1410
01:41:55,484 --> 01:41:58,033
We've been freaks
in a fucking sideshow.

1411
01:41:58,112 --> 01:42:02,709
We're a bunch of criminals.
We oughta be in jail.
That's all there is to it.

1412
01:42:02,867 --> 01:42:04,915
I'm ashamed.

1413
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:09,382
Not you, coach. Yeah. I'm
really ashamed of myself.

1414
01:42:14,128 --> 01:42:16,472
See, Ned was right.

1415
01:42:16,547 --> 01:42:18,015
Violence
is killing this sport.

1416
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:20,184
It's dragging it
through the mud.

1417
01:42:20,259 --> 01:42:21,306
If things keep up
the way they are,

1418
01:42:21,385 --> 01:42:24,389
hockey players will be nothing
but actors, punks.

1419
01:42:26,432 --> 01:42:29,106
I'm not playing
my last game that way.

1420
01:42:29,185 --> 01:42:31,654
Last game?
Yeah.

1421
01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:34,903
It's my last game,
and I wanna play it straight.

1422
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:37,906
No more "nail 'em!" No more "fuck
with 'em!" That's finished.

1423
01:42:37,985 --> 01:42:41,956
I want to win that championship
tonight, but I wanna win it clean.

1424
01:42:42,031 --> 01:42:45,626
Old-time hockey, like when
I got started. You know?

1425
01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:50,958
Toe Blake, Dit Clapper, Eddie Shore.
Those guys were the greats.

1426
01:42:52,792 --> 01:42:55,636
I don't know what to say.
It's up to you.

1427
01:43:08,349 --> 01:43:11,523
Reg is our coach.
Sure, old-time hockey.

1428
01:43:11,602 --> 01:43:13,604
- Like Eddie Shore.
- Yeah!

1429
01:43:14,689 --> 01:43:18,739
Coach, our line starts?
Sure.

1430
01:43:20,277 --> 01:43:21,950
We got a game to win.

1431
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:23,781
This is the big one, guys!

1432
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:28,998
Evening, boys.

1433
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:34,091
Wimpy, how are ya?
Crash, how are you?
Scotty.

1434
01:43:34,291 --> 01:43:36,794
Better than Philadelphia
this time.

1435
01:43:37,169 --> 01:43:40,173
You're gonna get an eyeball
of the new Charlestown Chiefs.

1436
01:43:40,256 --> 01:43:44,306
Ladies and gentlemen, this has all
the earmarks of a hockey classic.

1437
01:43:44,385 --> 01:43:48,356
The championship confrontation between
the Syracuse Bulldogs and the...

1438
01:43:48,431 --> 01:43:51,480
Here they come now! The
rags-to-riches Cinderella contenders

1439
01:43:51,559 --> 01:43:54,438
of the Federal League,
the Charlestown Chiefs!

1440
01:44:11,495 --> 01:44:14,499
Let's go, Chiefs!
Let's go, Chiefs!

1441
01:44:14,582 --> 01:44:18,758
Let's go, Chiefs!
Let's go, Chiefs!

1442
01:44:18,836 --> 01:44:22,807
Let's go, Chiefs!
Let's go, Chiefs!

1443
01:44:37,021 --> 01:44:39,490
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I can't explain this delay.</i>

1444
01:44:39,565 --> 01:44:42,193
<i>I don't know why Syracuse has
elected to miss the warm-up.</i>

1445
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:45,530
<i>The Chiefs have already skated
over to their bench.</i>

1446
01:44:45,613 --> 01:44:49,538
<i>It might be Syracuse is afraid
to come out and face the Chiefs.</i>

1447
01:44:49,617 --> 01:44:51,585
<i>Oh, thanks, Bill.</i>

1448
01:44:53,496 --> 01:44:55,590
<i>Good heavens!</i>

1449
01:44:55,664 --> 01:44:58,463
<i>I've just been handed
the Syracuse roster,</i>

1450
01:44:58,542 --> 01:45:01,170
<i>and it appears the Syracuse
Bulldog management</i>

1451
01:45:01,253 --> 01:45:05,303
<i>is real thirsty for a big grudge-match
type victory here tonight.</i>

1452
01:45:05,382 --> 01:45:09,057
They've brought back
for this one contest...

1453
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:13,016
Here they come now, led by
someone we all know very well,

1454
01:45:13,098 --> 01:45:15,521
<i>Tim "Dr. Hook" McCracken!</i>

1455
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:21,320
<i>And here's a name from the past.
Ross "Mad Dog" Madison.</i>

1456
01:45:21,398 --> 01:45:22,570
<i>Ross, as you know,</i>

1457
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:25,904
<i>never travels anywhere without his
longtime friend and attorney,</i>

1458
01:45:25,986 --> 01:45:28,330
<i>Sam "Small Print" Lyman.</i>

1459
01:45:28,405 --> 01:45:31,124
<i>And here's a name
for you nostalgia fans.</i>

1460
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:33,544
<i>Clarence "Screaming Buffalo"
Swamptown!</i>

1461
01:45:33,619 --> 01:45:36,748
<i>I'll never forget an exclusive interview
I did with him many years ago</i>

1462
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:39,209
<i>when Buffalo revealed that he
liked to call his hockey stick</i>

1463
01:45:39,291 --> 01:45:40,759
<i>The Big Tomahawk.</i>

1464
01:45:40,835 --> 01:45:44,339
<i>He usually refers to the opposing
players as The Little Scalps.</i>

1465
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:47,095
I thought he'd been
suspended forever.

1466
01:45:47,508 --> 01:45:50,307
<i>Andre' "Poodle" Lussier,
defense.</i>

1467
01:45:50,386 --> 01:45:52,184
<i>Andre' has been living</i>

1468
01:45:52,263 --> 01:45:54,311
<i>in semi-seclusion
in northern Quebec</i>

1469
01:45:54,390 --> 01:45:57,360
<i>since the unfortunate
Denny Pratt tragedy.</i>

1470
01:45:57,643 --> 01:45:59,190
Not Poodle!

1471
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:01,364
<i>And from Mile Forty,
Saskatchewan,</i>

1472
01:46:01,438 --> 01:46:04,988
<i>where he now runs
a doughnut shop, number 15,</i>

1473
01:46:05,067 --> 01:46:07,445
<i>former penalty-minute record
holder of the Federal League</i>

1474
01:46:07,528 --> 01:46:12,375
<i>for the years 1960 to 1968
inclusive, Gilmore Tuttle.</i>

1475
01:46:12,616 --> 01:46:14,459
<i>Gilmore Tuttle.</i>

1476
01:46:15,703 --> 01:46:17,956
<i>Oh, gee. Hold the phone.</i>

1477
01:46:18,038 --> 01:46:20,416
<i>This is
an unscheduled surprise.</i>

1478
01:46:23,085 --> 01:46:24,132
It's him!

1479
01:46:24,211 --> 01:46:28,057
<i>This young man has had
a very trying rookie season</i>

1480
01:46:28,132 --> 01:46:32,353
<i>what with the litigation, the notoriety,
his subsequent deportation to Canada</i>

1481
01:46:32,428 --> 01:46:34,931
<i>and that country's refusal
to accept him,</i>

1482
01:46:35,014 --> 01:46:37,483
<i>that's more than most
21-year-olds could handle.</i>

1483
01:46:37,558 --> 01:46:40,437
<i>Ogilthorp.
Oggie Ogilthorpe.</i>

1484
01:46:57,578 --> 01:46:58,875
Hi, Oggie.

1485
01:47:01,457 --> 01:47:03,630
Buy you a soda
after the game!

1486
01:47:05,878 --> 01:47:09,633
Hi. You know
Toe Blake? No?

1487
01:47:11,675 --> 01:47:14,599
We'll straighten you out,
you little prick.

1488
01:47:20,017 --> 01:47:21,610
How.

1489
01:47:22,645 --> 01:47:26,070
They don't call me Dr. Hook for nothing.
How ya doing?

1490
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:30,786
All right, no high-sticking,
no tripping, no slashing...

1491
01:47:30,861 --> 01:47:33,330
Major surgery. Open heart.

1492
01:47:33,572 --> 01:47:36,792
I'm waiting for quiet.
Yeah, you'll have quiet.

1493
01:47:43,374 --> 01:47:44,876
Give 'em hell!

1494
01:47:51,882 --> 01:47:54,101
Give 'em
the old-time hockey!

1495
01:47:57,888 --> 01:47:59,140
Good crowd.

1496
01:47:59,223 --> 01:48:00,395
Shirley!

1497
01:48:00,474 --> 01:48:02,317
Teamwork! Teamwork! Teamwork!

1498
01:48:02,393 --> 01:48:05,021
Eddie Shore!
Come on, get up!

1499
01:48:06,105 --> 01:48:10,235
One with the universe.
One with the universe.
Nothing matters.

1500
01:48:10,317 --> 01:48:12,490
This reporter is stunned!

1501
01:48:12,569 --> 01:48:15,368
The Charlestown Chiefs
are not fighting back.

1502
01:48:25,916 --> 01:48:29,136
Keep the guys off me!
Come on!

1503
01:48:35,592 --> 01:48:38,687
The Chiefs' performance tonight has
got to be a bitter disappointment

1504
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:40,810
to these 4,000
Charlestown fans

1505
01:48:40,889 --> 01:48:43,017
who have packed
this War Memorial,

1506
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:46,946
paying good money
to witness this fiasco.

1507
01:48:47,021 --> 01:48:49,865
Get Oggie!
Move away, Wanchuk.

1508
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:53,695
You're screening me!
You're screening me!
Move away!

1509
01:48:54,445 --> 01:48:56,618
Give 'em some of that back!

1510
01:48:57,322 --> 01:48:59,791
Don't let 'em
push you like that.

1511
01:49:15,799 --> 01:49:17,142
Getup!

1512
01:49:17,217 --> 01:49:18,514
Get off your ass!

1513
01:49:18,594 --> 01:49:20,642
I don't know
what's wrong!

1514
01:49:23,932 --> 01:49:26,310
You bums!
You're no damn good!

1515
01:49:33,859 --> 01:49:35,452
Get up off your <i>ass!</i>

1516
01:49:53,504 --> 01:49:56,348
Okay, you guys. Let's get
some speed out there.

1517
01:49:56,423 --> 01:49:57,424
Cement heads.

1518
01:49:57,508 --> 01:50:00,057
Keep your eyes open.
Better passing.

1519
01:50:00,135 --> 01:50:02,934
We got a big three
coming up out there.

1520
01:50:03,013 --> 01:50:05,186
Try to come back
with the wingers maybe.

1521
01:50:05,891 --> 01:50:07,689
Tonight's the night.

1522
01:50:07,768 --> 01:50:10,942
Who wants an ice pack?
Over here, Charlie.

1523
01:50:13,023 --> 01:50:15,776
We need some more
coordination out there.

1524
01:50:17,027 --> 01:50:19,325
Keep your eyes open.
Better passing.

1525
01:50:24,409 --> 01:50:26,161
I'm coming!

1526
01:50:27,204 --> 01:50:28,456
It's all right.

1527
01:50:28,539 --> 01:50:32,419
Mother of God. REGGIE: I want
a big rally this period.

1528
01:50:33,627 --> 01:50:36,255
- We're losing!
- More teamwork, guys.

1529
01:50:36,338 --> 01:50:38,557
They're burying us alive!

1530
01:50:38,632 --> 01:50:40,930
Eddie Shore?
Piss on Eddie Shore.

1531
01:50:41,009 --> 01:50:43,728
Old-time hockey?
Piss on old-time hockey!

1532
01:50:43,804 --> 01:50:46,478
You're blowing it! Boys!

1533
01:50:46,932 --> 01:50:50,311
Every scout in the NHL
is out there tonight

1534
01:50:50,394 --> 01:50:52,112
with contracts
in their pockets,

1535
01:50:52,187 --> 01:50:54,189
and they're looking
for talent.

1536
01:50:54,273 --> 01:50:56,275
For winners!

1537
01:50:56,692 --> 01:50:59,286
All my years of publicity,

1538
01:50:59,361 --> 01:51:03,582
all the fashion shows
and radiothons for nothing!

1539
01:51:03,657 --> 01:51:05,830
They come here tonight

1540
01:51:07,369 --> 01:51:09,872
to scout the Chiefs!

1541
01:51:10,164 --> 01:51:13,839
The toughest team
in the Federal League!

1542
01:51:14,251 --> 01:51:15,924
Not this

1543
01:51:16,587 --> 01:51:20,433
bunch of...pussies!

1544
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:36,197
Scouts?

1545
01:51:54,041 --> 01:51:55,463
This is more like it.

1546
01:51:55,542 --> 01:51:58,921
It makes me feel glad to see the
Chiefs on the warpath again,

1547
01:51:59,004 --> 01:52:00,677
to coin a phrase.

1548
01:52:04,051 --> 01:52:07,681
God, it's been a long time since
this place saw my shadow.

1549
01:52:12,976 --> 01:52:16,981
What am I doing here? You look fabulous.
Now, come on.

1550
01:52:26,156 --> 01:52:27,954
God, I'd forgotten.

1551
01:52:33,956 --> 01:52:38,006
<i>Everybody is on their feet screaming,
"Kill! Kill!" This is hockey!</i>

1552
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:42,344
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Let's go, Chiefs!

1553
01:53:07,406 --> 01:53:10,159
All right! Kill 'em!

1554
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:30,596
<i>They're pummeling each other.</i>

1555
01:53:30,679 --> 01:53:34,229
<i>Wait a minute. Ned Braden
is skating out on the ice.</i>

1556
01:53:42,357 --> 01:53:44,610
<i>He's not fighting. No. He's...</i>

1557
01:53:52,909 --> 01:53:56,630
<i>Ned Braden is starting to take
off articles of his uniform.</i>

1558
01:55:39,307 --> 01:55:40,775
Way to go, Ned.

1559
01:55:40,851 --> 01:55:42,194
<i>I don't want
any youngsters out there</i>

1560
01:55:42,269 --> 01:55:45,364
<i>to get the idea this is
the way to play hockey.</i>

1561
01:55:50,444 --> 01:55:52,697
Stop that!
That's disgusting.

1562
01:55:56,908 --> 01:55:59,787
I protest!
Protest? Protest my...

1563
01:55:59,870 --> 01:56:01,964
<i>I'm certainly glad
Mrs. Carr isn't here tonight</i>

1564
01:56:02,038 --> 01:56:05,042
<i>because this is
a lascivious display...</i>

1565
01:56:07,752 --> 01:56:09,425
Take it off!

1566
01:56:10,714 --> 01:56:12,136
Make him stop
or we're leaving!

1567
01:56:12,215 --> 01:56:13,558
Get your paws off me,
Scarf ace!

1568
01:56:13,633 --> 01:56:16,603
Stop him! This is a serious
game, not a freak show.

1569
01:56:16,678 --> 01:56:20,103
What are you talking about?
This is hockey!

1570
01:56:22,058 --> 01:56:25,312
You're afraid of these goons, aren't ya?
Watch out, punk!

1571
01:56:27,731 --> 01:56:31,656
Get that pervert off! Get your
hands off me or forfeit this game!

1572
01:56:31,735 --> 01:56:34,033
Forfeit, my ass!
Look at that!

1573
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:40,995
All right, that's it.
That's the game.
You lose. Out! Lose?

1574
01:56:41,077 --> 01:56:42,829
What the hell are you
talking about'?

1575
01:56:42,913 --> 01:56:46,417
Come on, dummy. You won the game.
Pick up your trophy.

1576
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:54,098
Here ya go, ya bum.

1577
01:57:03,266 --> 01:57:06,520
<i>The Chiefs have won the
championship of the Federal League!</i>

1578
01:57:07,604 --> 01:57:10,107
He's gonna
catch his death out there!

1579
01:57:31,962 --> 01:57:34,932
<i>I said some bad things about the
boy, but we can explain that</i>

1580
01:57:35,006 --> 01:57:37,304
<i>to the exuberance
and excitement of youth,</i>

1581
01:57:37,384 --> 01:57:39,933
<i>because he's certainly
changed his ways now.</i>

1582
01:57:43,974 --> 01:57:45,396
My boy!

1583
01:58:14,963 --> 01:58:18,263
Hi, Francine!
Francine!

1584
01:58:19,593 --> 01:58:22,267
Come on, honey. You got all
the room in the world.

1585
01:58:22,345 --> 01:58:24,598
You ain't gonna
hit anything. Come on!

1586
01:58:28,268 --> 01:58:31,863
I got good news. I'm paying
by the hour for this thing.

1587
01:58:31,938 --> 01:58:34,942
The Minnesota Night Hawks.
I'm coaching. The Big Apple.

1588
01:58:35,025 --> 01:58:37,278
Somebody's playing
a joke on you.

1589
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:40,614
No! I've got a contract
back there in the car!

1590
01:58:40,697 --> 01:58:42,370
The Chiefs are history.

1591
01:58:42,449 --> 01:58:44,292
But the minute
I get up to Minnesota,

1592
01:58:44,367 --> 01:58:46,586
I'm gonna bring
my guys up there.

1593
01:58:46,661 --> 01:58:51,212
We're a solid act, honey. We're
starting out with something big.

1594
01:58:51,916 --> 01:58:54,214
Oh, Jesus!
What?

1595
01:58:55,128 --> 01:58:57,551
You don't have my number.

1596
01:58:57,631 --> 01:58:59,804
If you want to get
in touch with me,

1597
01:58:59,883 --> 01:59:02,887
do it through the team,
the Minnesota Night Hawks.

1598
01:59:03,803 --> 01:59:05,476
You're gonna need money
or something.

1599
01:59:05,555 --> 01:59:09,560
Or maybe things won't work
out the way you expect.

1600
01:59:10,226 --> 01:59:13,150
Geez, we've got a lot of
years between us, Francine.

1601
01:59:13,271 --> 01:59:15,239
Some hard miles, you know?
I know.

1602
01:59:16,483 --> 01:59:18,986
Shut up,
you goddamn meathead!

1603
01:59:19,069 --> 01:59:20,992
Honey, I gotta go.

1604
01:59:21,071 --> 01:59:25,247
If things don't work out, get in
touch with me in Minneapolis.

1605
01:59:25,909 --> 01:59:27,286
Bye. Reggie.

1606
01:59:27,369 --> 01:59:29,667
I could make
a goddamn fortune.

1607
01:59:51,935 --> 01:59:55,109
Is she coming to Minnesota?
Oh, for sure!

1608
02:01:37,332 --> 02:01:40,927
<i>Ooh and it's all right</i>
<i>And it's comm' along</i>

1609
02:01:41,002 --> 02:01:44,632
<i>We gotta get right back
To where we started from</i>

1610
02:01:44,714 --> 02:01:47,388
<i>Love is good
Love can be strong</i>

1611
02:01:47,467 --> 02:01:51,142
<i>We gotta get right back
To where we started from</i>

1612
02:01:57,977 --> 02:02:01,481
<i>Do you remember the day
That shiny day</i>

1613
02:02:01,564 --> 02:02:04,738
<i>When you first came my way</i>

1614
02:02:04,818 --> 02:02:08,743
<i>I said no one
could take your place</i>

1615
02:02:11,115 --> 02:02:14,244
<i>And if you get hurt
If you get hurt</i>

1616
02:02:14,327 --> 02:02:17,456
<i>By the little things I say</i>

1617
02:02:17,539 --> 02:02:22,670
<i>I can put that smile
back on your face</i>

1618
02:02:22,752 --> 02:02:26,507
<i>Ooh and it's all right
And it's coming on</i>

1619
02:02:26,589 --> 02:02:30,014
<i>We gotta get right back
To where we started from</i>

1620
02:02:30,093 --> 02:02:32,812
<i>Love is good
Love can be strong</i>

1621
02:02:32,887 --> 02:02:36,312
<i>We gotta get right back
To where we started from</i>

1622
02:02:36,391 --> 02:02:39,315
<i>And it's all right</i>
<i>And it's comm' along</i>

1623
02:02:39,394 --> 02:02:43,069
<i>We gotta get right back
To where we started from</i>

1624
02:02:43,147 --> 02:02:45,650
<i>Love is good
Love can be strong</i>

1625
02:02:45,733 --> 02:02:49,454
<i>We gotta get right back
To where we started from</i>
