1
00:01:39,493 --> 00:01:43,480
I heard you interfering little bastards
rummage around my yard.

2
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:47,360
I'll thank you for keeping the owls off of my cats.

3
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:19,451
You sleep OK?

4
00:02:21,537 --> 00:02:23,914
Sorta.

5
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,381
I, uh...

6
00:02:32,464 --> 00:02:35,384
God, Jean, I don't know what happened.

7
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:38,637
It's like a red mist or...

8
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:43,434
Something comes over me and I...

9
00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:49,356
But I feel like you backed me up in a corner and I...

10
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:52,609
You do that, and uh...

11
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:55,404
I hate it when I'm like that.

12
00:03:09,793 --> 00:03:11,462
I'm sorry.

13
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:18,343
Can you forgive me?

14
00:03:27,644 --> 00:03:29,730
What?!

15
00:03:34,735 --> 00:03:36,487
Fuck!

16
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:45,453
You promised...

17
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:48,372
if it happened again...

18
00:03:48,373 --> 00:03:50,459
You promised.

19
00:03:51,418 --> 00:03:55,588
OK, this is last week and up to yesterday.

20
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:57,049
- All right?
- OK.

21
00:03:57,132 --> 00:04:00,384
- I stuck an extra 50 bucks in there.
- Kitty, I can't...

22
00:04:00,385 --> 00:04:02,762
- You can. Listen...
- Here, just take it.

23
00:04:02,763 --> 00:04:06,308
I don't wanna see you coming around here
anymore looking like this.

24
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:11,647
You take care.
Take care of that girl. Get going. OK.

25
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,565
We have a reciprocity agreement with Kansas.

26
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:16,735
If you can stay in this shelter for a week.

27
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,446
- I could find you a place in Wichita.
- No.

28
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:23,408
Every man in town who beats a woman
knows where this shelter is.

29
00:04:23,534 --> 00:04:25,410
Do you have someone you can stay with?

30
00:04:25,494 --> 00:04:28,621
I don't think you really understand
just how worried I am.

31
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:30,624
I don't know.
Maybe they went shopping.

32
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:34,670
I wish someone in this goddamn place would just...

33
00:04:34,795 --> 00:04:37,589
would just give me the truth.

34
00:04:39,883 --> 00:04:42,803
Then we could find Jean pretty damn quick.

35
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:50,727
Tribune, Kansas.
Do you wanna go there?

36
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:54,481
Sure. Maybe. I mean,
we can go anywhere we want.

37
00:04:54,606 --> 00:04:57,609
How about Loving, New Mexico?

38
00:04:59,695 --> 00:05:02,322
- I like that.
- Me too.

39
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:06,160
Topeka.

40
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:08,245
Santa Cruz.

41
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,790
Oh, my gosh.
There's a Butt, Montana.

42
00:05:11,874 --> 00:05:14,917
It's pronounced "Bute."

43
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:17,337
- Mom?
- Oh, no. No!

44
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,355
Hey!

45
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:41,527
She's not going anywhere.
There's a rod sticking through the block.

46
00:05:41,528 --> 00:05:43,822
I'm heading to Sioux Falls.

47
00:05:45,282 --> 00:05:46,617
Yeah.

48
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,788
Just take what you need.

49
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:03,634
So one inch is 83 miles.

50
00:06:07,596 --> 00:06:10,933
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

51
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,978
Aloha, Oregon.

52
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:19,775
It's only ten inches away.

53
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:25,947
So that's 830 miles and we've already gone 300 miles...

54
00:06:25,948 --> 00:06:28,867
We're going to Wyoming.

55
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:04,736
What's in Wyoming?

56
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,199
It's where your grandfather lives.

57
00:07:11,285 --> 00:07:13,370
I have a grandfather?

58
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:17,249
Not much of one.

59
00:07:20,252 --> 00:07:22,546
When were you going to tell me?

60
00:07:28,302 --> 00:07:30,471
Oh, I'm fine.

61
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,476
Smells like rain.

62
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:37,895
It's not gonna rain today.

63
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:44,234
You haven't been right about the weather since 1972.

64
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:46,653
I know what rain looks like.

65
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,118
You got something on your mind this morning?

66
00:07:53,202 --> 00:07:56,038
The goddamn bear's back.

67
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,920
Well, what do you think you're gonna do about it?

68
00:08:03,003 --> 00:08:05,214
What I should have done a year ago.

69
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:43,669
Did anyone notice if he had cubs?
Did you see cubs with him?

70
00:09:19,121 --> 00:09:20,706
OK.

71
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:43,103
- It's under control, Einar.
- You get out of the way and it will be.

72
00:09:43,228 --> 00:09:46,857
Come on, let's let the Fish and Game take care of this.

73
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:50,943
This isn't some pet dog they're after.

74
00:09:50,944 --> 00:09:54,990
I think they can tell the difference, all right?

75
00:09:55,824 --> 00:09:57,993
That says what a college education gets you.

76
00:09:58,118 --> 00:09:59,995
Here we go.

77
00:10:16,386 --> 00:10:18,055
Mom.

78
00:10:18,138 --> 00:10:20,140
Welcome to Wyoming.

79
00:10:21,683 --> 00:10:24,061
Mom, this is us.

80
00:10:28,065 --> 00:10:30,442
So is my grandpa nice?

81
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:36,698
Why didn't you tell me about him?

82
00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:51,004
Einar!

83
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:14,445
I don't want you here.

84
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:19,032
At least we agree on something.

85
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:21,535
I don't wanna be here either.

86
00:11:23,203 --> 00:11:26,540
We need a place to stay for about a month or so.

87
00:11:27,374 --> 00:11:31,670
Looks like you need every part of your head examined.

88
00:11:32,296 --> 00:11:34,256
Is this yours?

89
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:38,343
She's yours too.

90
00:11:42,306 --> 00:11:46,685
You telling me I have a grandchild I don't know about?

91
00:11:47,728 --> 00:11:52,399
I'm telling you I was pregnant at Griffin's funeral.

92
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:54,485
Where you been till now?

93
00:11:55,944 --> 00:11:58,238
We've been on the road for two days.

94
00:11:59,072 --> 00:12:01,283
We lived in Iowa.

95
00:12:02,117 --> 00:12:04,703
Now this suddenly seems like home?

96
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:07,206
What's her name?

97
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:09,416
My name's Griff.

98
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:12,753
Griff Gilkyson.

99
00:12:13,796 --> 00:12:16,089
That's an unusual name for a girl.

100
00:12:18,175 --> 00:12:20,260
Einar, please.

101
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:24,097
Just till I can earn enough to get us out of here.

102
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:52,042
There's a room in the basement.

103
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:17,693
I'm sorry.

104
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:36,378
Hey. I'm gonna go into town
and look for a job.

105
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:39,298
You think you'll be all right here?

106
00:13:39,381 --> 00:13:42,301
All right, well, just... be good.

107
00:13:43,677 --> 00:13:45,637
Love you.

108
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:15,042
I used the bathroom.

109
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:17,127
I heard you.

110
00:14:19,838 --> 00:14:22,883
- Are you hungry?
- Not yet.

111
00:14:27,262 --> 00:14:29,556
Is there a McDonald's in town?

112
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,975
- You got five dollars?
- No, I don't.

113
00:14:32,976 --> 00:14:39,233
Well, then I don't think going into town
for a meal would be a very good idea.

114
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:50,619
How was your night?

115
00:14:51,453 --> 00:14:53,622
All right, I guess.

116
00:14:53,747 --> 00:14:55,916
Left or right?

117
00:14:58,335 --> 00:15:00,295
Let's do the right.

118
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,589
Left could use a rest.

119
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,307
Pain bad all the time now?

120
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:14,476
Gets my full attention.

121
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:16,061
Yep.

122
00:15:24,611 --> 00:15:26,697
What happened with my bear?

123
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,865
It's his own damn bear.

124
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:31,160
You telling me he's still alive?

125
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:34,621
He's fine.
He's in that zoo Angie built.

126
00:15:56,393 --> 00:15:58,812
Dreaming about the sea last night.

127
00:15:59,313 --> 00:16:02,232
Did you get wet?

128
00:16:02,983 --> 00:16:05,277
I walked right in.

129
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:09,948
Felt like falling in love.

130
00:16:13,202 --> 00:16:15,579
Smelled like a woman.

131
00:16:16,538 --> 00:16:18,707
Tasted like one too.

132
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:21,210
Your memory's not that good.

133
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:24,463
Hey.

134
00:16:25,923 --> 00:16:27,883
Down there.

135
00:16:29,676 --> 00:16:31,845
See Jean kept her looks.

136
00:16:33,931 --> 00:16:36,558
Said she brought her daughter with her.

137
00:16:36,642 --> 00:16:38,852
She says it's Griffin's.

138
00:16:39,978 --> 00:16:41,980
Granddaughter.

139
00:16:43,315 --> 00:16:46,443
That's a nice thing for a man to have.

140
00:16:48,862 --> 00:16:51,657
I might go into town for breakfast.

141
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:54,493
All right.

142
00:16:57,913 --> 00:17:00,624
Taking the girl with you?

143
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:03,043
Anything else you need?

144
00:17:05,337 --> 00:17:07,214
Yeah, look in on the bear.

145
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:12,719
- What?
- Check on the bear.

146
00:17:12,845 --> 00:17:16,890
Check on the...?
Why the hell would I do that?

147
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:18,892
'Cause I asked you to.

148
00:18:13,947 --> 00:18:16,116
Are those my dad's things?

149
00:18:17,242 --> 00:18:19,161
Yeah, they are.

150
00:18:19,244 --> 00:18:21,330
Where does he live now?

151
00:18:23,415 --> 00:18:27,169
He's dead.
Didn't your mother tell you that?

152
00:18:28,003 --> 00:18:30,631
Yeah. But she said you were dead too.

153
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:38,555
Are you confused about why they call
a room with a table in it a dining room?

154
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:40,516
No, sir.

155
00:18:46,355 --> 00:18:50,317
Since it looks like you didn't have
any trouble making that sandwich,

156
00:18:50,442 --> 00:18:54,071
I'd like you to make another one at 11:30.
Will you do that?

157
00:18:54,196 --> 00:18:57,824
- Yes, sir.
- And take it to that man in the little house.

158
00:18:57,825 --> 00:19:00,119
And a glass of milk.

159
00:19:00,244 --> 00:19:02,204
Yes, sir.

160
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:07,960
Bear? Goddammit.

161
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:10,420
"Go check on the bear."

162
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:27,771
Goddammit.

163
00:19:50,794 --> 00:19:53,505
Nice wheels, Einar!

164
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,008
Where did you get the rig?

165
00:19:56,133 --> 00:20:01,013
Nancy Sidwell had this shipped up from
that retirement village where Ernie died.

166
00:20:01,138 --> 00:20:03,724
Maybe it was the bike killed Ernie.

167
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:07,895
What killed Ernie was a lifetime of Nancy's cooking.

168
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,940
- Your pickup broke down again?
- Oh, hell, no. Pickup's fine.

169
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:15,193
I'm just out here training for a goddamn marathon.

170
00:20:15,194 --> 00:20:21,658
I like the flag. Without an orange flag
like that, you might look ridiculous.

171
00:20:48,894 --> 00:20:51,688
- Hello, Ken, Catherine.
- Einar.

172
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:57,653
What have I got? Bills.

173
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:02,866
- Morning, Einar.
- Morning yourself, Nina.

174
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,661
Do you believe they're still sending junk mail to my boy?

175
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:09,539
Well, maybe the dead are flattered
to get a letter. Ever think about that?

176
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,917
I'll let you know when I'm gone.

177
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:15,462
Maybe I'll send you a postcard from the other side.

178
00:21:15,546 --> 00:21:18,172
Hey, how's Mitch doing?

179
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:20,175
Mitch - he's dreaming about the sea.

180
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:23,178
Oh, yeah?
I used to live by the ocean.

181
00:21:23,303 --> 00:21:25,597
Up in Oregon for about a year.

182
00:21:25,681 --> 00:21:29,976
Yeah, too much rain if you ask me.
But I sure like the sound it makes.

183
00:21:29,977 --> 00:21:32,479
- Grandma.
- What's up?

184
00:21:32,563 --> 00:21:36,316
If you get depressed, pull up a chair
to your kitchen sink and turn on the tap.

185
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,778
If I ever get depressed,
remind me not to come to you for advice.

186
00:21:39,862 --> 00:21:42,489
Hey!

187
00:21:44,032 --> 00:21:48,120
I wonder if it's hard being that drunk
this early in the morning.

188
00:21:48,203 --> 00:21:50,914
Oh, it's easy if you don't stop drinking all night.

189
00:21:50,998 --> 00:21:55,294
- You'd know. How do you want your eggs?
- Scrambled.

190
00:21:56,336 --> 00:22:00,507
Hey, there, boys.
What can I get you this morning?

191
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:06,137
Get down on this table and I can see if
I can stay on you till the buzzer sounds.

192
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:08,724
Ugh! I hope you're
having a lot of fun, Chris,

193
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:13,353
'cause soon as I get one arm free,
I'm gonna kick your sorry ass.

194
00:22:13,437 --> 00:22:15,856
Oh, now look what you went and did!

195
00:22:17,065 --> 00:22:18,776
Good morning, fellas.

196
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:21,236
I'm gonna be your new waiter.
Want some coffee?

197
00:22:21,361 --> 00:22:25,115
- Why don't you screw off, you old bastard?
- What?

198
00:22:29,578 --> 00:22:32,706
Son, now I don't wanna work myself short of breath.

199
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:36,293
You wanna continue this?
It can be over all at once.

200
00:22:36,376 --> 00:22:39,421
Because that's how goddamn fast your life can change.

201
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:41,590
You believe me?

202
00:22:46,595 --> 00:22:48,889
Sorry for the mess.

203
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:13,914
- Hi.
- Hi.

204
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,715
My name's Griff.

205
00:23:23,841 --> 00:23:25,801
My name is Mitch.

206
00:23:26,635 --> 00:23:28,637
That for me?

207
00:23:37,187 --> 00:23:38,647
Thank you.

208
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:45,529
Yeah, I know.

209
00:23:45,612 --> 00:23:49,366
I almost threw up first time I looked at it.

210
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:52,076
You feeling a little queasy?

211
00:23:52,077 --> 00:23:54,287
I'm fine.

212
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:56,248
OK.

213
00:23:57,416 --> 00:24:00,752
I got queasy first time I saw a man eat a snail.

214
00:24:00,836 --> 00:24:03,547
- You ever eat a snail?
- No.

215
00:24:04,173 --> 00:24:06,800
Me neither.
This looks good.

216
00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:16,185
- What happened to you?
- I was mauled by a bear.

217
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,978
I saw a bear in a cage yesterday.

218
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:21,190
Yeah. That was my bear.

219
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:27,446
About a year ago, he was eating
one of your grandfather's calves

220
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:32,659
and... well, we sort of
interrupted his dinner, you know.

221
00:24:32,743 --> 00:24:35,995
He thought we were gonna take it away from him.

222
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:38,791
You know bears -
they don't like to share.

223
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,295
Did the bear bite Einar?

224
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:46,715
No, I was closer.

225
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:52,346
- I didn't know anyone ate snails.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

226
00:24:52,471 --> 00:24:55,681
In those fancy restaurants up in Cheyenne,

227
00:24:55,682 --> 00:25:00,062
they eat 'em all the time like there's nothing to it.

228
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:05,484
Once I saw this kid eat a moth.

229
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:09,655
- You could hear the crunch.
- Oh, no, no!

230
00:25:17,913 --> 00:25:20,707
Oh, my gosh! Look at that!

231
00:25:22,376 --> 00:25:24,252
Einar.

232
00:25:24,253 --> 00:25:26,254
Hey, Angie.

233
00:25:26,255 --> 00:25:28,966
I didn't expect to see you in this crowd.

234
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:33,846
I guess at my age it's good
to be seen just about anywhere.

235
00:25:34,596 --> 00:25:37,724
Well, Fish and Game said he'd settle down in a few days.

236
00:25:37,808 --> 00:25:41,895
Of course, they also said
he'd eat anything, which he doesn't.

237
00:25:41,979 --> 00:25:49,402
I don't get it. Nobody would pay five dollars
for the mountain lion I used to keep in here.

238
00:25:49,403 --> 00:25:51,571
How's Mitch?

239
00:25:51,572 --> 00:25:54,074
He's dreaming about the sea.

240
00:25:54,908 --> 00:25:56,910
I always wanted a boat.

241
00:25:56,994 --> 00:25:59,912
My dad used to take us out.
It was so great.

242
00:25:59,913 --> 00:26:02,124
What happened to the lion?

243
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:05,127
He died.

244
00:26:07,337 --> 00:26:09,423
Lucky lion.

245
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:19,725
Hello, Griffin.

246
00:26:34,948 --> 00:26:39,870
Well, it says here you might have
already won $15 million.

247
00:26:40,704 --> 00:26:43,832
Probably ought to send it in for you, though.

248
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:47,878
Probably the same damn odds as losing a kid early.

249
00:26:48,003 --> 00:26:49,963
You got that done.

250
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:56,553
You should know your wife came back.

251
00:27:03,227 --> 00:27:07,189
You could have steered her someplace else.

252
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:12,069
Just 'cause you're dead doesn't mean you can't be useful.

253
00:27:14,696 --> 00:27:16,990
See you tomorrow, boy.

254
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:24,790
Kid sure looks a whole lot like you, though.

255
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,252
Top to bottom.

256
00:27:32,005 --> 00:27:33,966
Mom!

257
00:27:35,008 --> 00:27:37,010
- Hey!
- I missed you.

258
00:27:37,094 --> 00:27:38,971
- Guess what. I got a job.
- Really?

259
00:27:38,972 --> 00:27:42,099
I start tomorrow.
So how was your day?

260
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:45,978
Not so great, huh?

261
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,031
Man, I'm tired.

262
00:28:40,282 --> 00:28:45,411
I think half the people we served
this morning came in just to look at you.

263
00:28:45,412 --> 00:28:47,915
Here you go.

264
00:28:47,998 --> 00:28:51,126
- What's this?
- Your half of the tips.

265
00:28:53,003 --> 00:28:57,174
I thought you said you were used to being on your feet.

266
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:01,677
I'm not used to telling everyone I meet
where I've been the last ten years.

267
00:29:01,678 --> 00:29:03,222
Well...

268
00:29:03,347 --> 00:29:05,098
Tell 'em you went crazy.

269
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:08,644
Tell 'em you've been locked up.

270
00:29:10,437 --> 00:29:12,731
That's what I've been telling 'em.

271
00:29:12,815 --> 00:29:14,900
Looks like we did real good today.

272
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:17,528
Guess I got you to thank for that.

273
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:20,948
Maybe I'll have some music on Saturday night.

274
00:29:21,073 --> 00:29:26,370
Of course, then again,
you'd have to dance with Billy and Wayne.

275
00:29:26,995 --> 00:29:29,289
Oh, that'd be a sight.

276
00:29:44,721 --> 00:29:46,723
Can I help you?

277
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:51,519
I'm Einar Gilkyson's daughter-in-law.

278
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,857
Yes, I know.
Did you want to come in?

279
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,069
Thank you.

280
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,156
- Any calls?
- Nothing.

281
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:09,246
Homemade lunch, you know.

282
00:30:16,003 --> 00:30:19,548
You got something there you want me to see?

283
00:30:26,013 --> 00:30:29,891
It's a police report.
But I didn't press charges.

284
00:30:29,892 --> 00:30:36,231
A shelter worker in Iowa thought I ought to
check in with authorities when I got settled.

285
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:40,193
He was my boyfriend.

286
00:30:40,194 --> 00:30:42,404
But, um...

287
00:30:42,488 --> 00:30:45,115
The report's not for this time.

288
00:30:45,949 --> 00:30:48,118
It was for another time.

289
00:30:51,455 --> 00:30:53,665
I'll make a copy.

290
00:31:06,178 --> 00:31:07,304
That's it.

291
00:31:12,643 --> 00:31:14,728
What are their names?

292
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:18,273
- Who?
- Your cats.

293
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:22,236
They don't have any names.

294
00:31:24,113 --> 00:31:26,073
How do you tell 'em apart?

295
00:31:26,907 --> 00:31:28,992
I don't tell 'em apart.

296
00:31:35,249 --> 00:31:39,211
Goddamn cheap-ass, Mickey Mouse,
foreign goddamn part...

297
00:31:39,336 --> 00:31:41,630
Oscar and Charlie.

298
00:31:41,713 --> 00:31:43,799
Hi, Charlie.

299
00:31:43,924 --> 00:31:46,635
Is that there a water-pump belt?

300
00:31:47,553 --> 00:31:50,055
Why don't you use the one out on the tractor?

301
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,141
Why don't I use the one out on the tractor?

302
00:31:52,266 --> 00:31:55,477
Hey, are you mumbling over there or something?

303
00:31:55,602 --> 00:31:57,896
The tractor belt's twice this size.

304
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,773
- Really?
- Yeah.

305
00:31:59,857 --> 00:32:01,859
Oh.

306
00:32:02,568 --> 00:32:05,194
Don't we have some spare belts in the barn?

307
00:32:05,195 --> 00:32:09,241
I got a great idea.
Why don't you go back in the house?

308
00:32:09,366 --> 00:32:14,246
Well, uh, damn. I was...
just trying to be helpful.

309
00:32:14,371 --> 00:32:18,333
If you don't want my help,
I'll just sit over here and shut up.

310
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:21,545
Pulling that out, it don't look like
you know what you're doing.

311
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:25,007
Just shut up! OK?
Shut up. You don't know what I'm doing.

312
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:27,593
- You don't know about the truck.
- Who you talking to?

313
00:32:27,718 --> 00:32:32,181
- Stop being a philosopher...
- Doggone second-generation immigrant,

314
00:32:32,306 --> 00:32:35,642
I bet I come over there and hang my bad foot in your ass.

315
00:32:47,196 --> 00:32:49,280
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

316
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:51,992
- See you tomorrow?
- Yep. See ya.

317
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,827
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey.

318
00:32:54,828 --> 00:32:56,914
- How was it?
- All right.

319
00:32:57,956 --> 00:33:01,502
- See ya, Einar.
- Got some groceries for dinner.

320
00:33:04,421 --> 00:33:06,089
OK.

321
00:33:09,092 --> 00:33:12,012
- Do you wanna take these inside, sweetie?
- Sure.

322
00:33:12,137 --> 00:33:13,472
- Got it?
- Yep.

323
00:33:14,848 --> 00:33:17,559
- Hey, Mitch.
- Hey, there.

324
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:25,901
What happened here?
Why did you stop running cows?

325
00:33:27,236 --> 00:33:29,655
When Griffin died, I ran out of help.

326
00:33:32,241 --> 00:33:35,702
Then I got older, Mitch got mauled,

327
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,873
and I sold the stock to stay on the place.

328
00:33:43,418 --> 00:33:46,004
Dinner will be ready in an hour.

329
00:33:48,507 --> 00:33:50,509
Come here, Sarah.

330
00:33:51,426 --> 00:33:53,845
Nope, stay here.

331
00:33:53,846 --> 00:33:56,140
- You finished?
- Yeah.

332
00:33:56,974 --> 00:34:00,519
Tell your kid to come down out of that tree.

333
00:34:02,813 --> 00:34:05,606
Come on, Charlie.

334
00:34:05,607 --> 00:34:08,235
Come on.
Don't be a fraidy-cat.

335
00:34:17,077 --> 00:34:18,954
Oh, Jesus.

336
00:34:20,956 --> 00:34:22,915
I'm sorry.

337
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:26,795
You're sorry, huh?
Well, that's just fine, then.

338
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:31,800
- I'll buy you a new one.
- Oh. Just that easy?

339
00:34:33,343 --> 00:34:38,265
Maybe I liked that plate. In fact, maybe
that was my favorite goddamn plate!

340
00:34:38,348 --> 00:34:40,433
- It's just a plate.
- That's it, huh?

341
00:34:40,434 --> 00:34:44,104
Did it ever occur to you
that not everything can be replaced?

342
00:34:51,487 --> 00:34:53,989
Come down out of that tree!

343
00:35:01,205 --> 00:35:05,793
- You want this on the table?
- No, over here. Thank you.

344
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:11,298
I'm so glad you're back, Jean.

345
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,684
What happened to Nellie?

346
00:35:24,978 --> 00:35:27,146
Nellie left.

347
00:35:27,147 --> 00:35:30,275
About a year after we buried Griffin.

348
00:35:31,527 --> 00:35:34,571
Einar just never got a handle on it.

349
00:35:34,655 --> 00:35:38,408
And then, when he hardly
even noticed Nellie anymore, why...

350
00:35:38,492 --> 00:35:41,620
She found another man.
Who wouldn't?

351
00:35:42,913 --> 00:35:45,290
Think they live in Colorado.

352
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,921
Do you think he blames me for losing his wife too?

353
00:35:51,004 --> 00:35:53,006
I imagine he does.

354
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,936
I don't want to stay here.

355
00:36:08,355 --> 00:36:10,441
What's wrong with him?

356
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,360
Well, it's not you.

357
00:36:14,278 --> 00:36:16,572
He just never got over it.

358
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,536
He really loved your dad.
You should know that.

359
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:25,038
- Did you?
- Of course.

360
00:36:27,624 --> 00:36:30,127
You do have a plan, though, right?

361
00:36:30,252 --> 00:36:33,045
I mean, we don't have to stay here forever?

362
00:36:33,046 --> 00:36:35,340
Sure, I do.

363
00:36:35,466 --> 00:36:39,428
Soon as I earn enough money,
I'm gonna get us right out of here.

364
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:42,848
You know what?
What do you think about...

365
00:36:42,973 --> 00:36:44,933
Butt, Montana?

366
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:53,400
Come on, let's play.
You don't know how to read anymore?

367
00:36:56,403 --> 00:36:58,071
Where'd the bottle come from?

368
00:36:59,448 --> 00:37:01,325
The granary.

369
00:37:01,408 --> 00:37:04,953
It's been there for a while.
Sometimes I just like to look at it.

370
00:37:05,037 --> 00:37:07,039
15, two.

371
00:37:07,122 --> 00:37:09,541
You gonna open it?

372
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:11,960
I'm not sure yet. 25.

373
00:37:12,044 --> 00:37:14,671
31 for two. Go.

374
00:37:16,006 --> 00:37:18,508
- Did you check on the bear?
- Eight.

375
00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:21,345
Yeah, you asked me to, didn't you?

376
00:37:22,054 --> 00:37:24,056
Here's a pair for two.

377
00:37:24,848 --> 00:37:27,059
I want you to feed him.

378
00:37:28,102 --> 00:37:30,312
- What?
- I want you to feed the bear.

379
00:37:30,395 --> 00:37:33,857
I don't trust Angie to feed anything much past herself.

380
00:37:33,941 --> 00:37:38,028
"Feed the bear." "Please feed the bear."
"Bear, do you like bear shoes?"

381
00:37:38,112 --> 00:37:42,825
"What kind of food do you like, Bear?
Steak, chicken?"

382
00:37:42,908 --> 00:37:44,910
- Einar.
- What?

383
00:37:45,953 --> 00:37:48,122
Is her being here gonna ruin you?

384
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:53,877
- The woman killed my son.
- Oh, come on.

385
00:37:53,961 --> 00:37:58,340
It was a car accident. They call them
accidents because it's nobody's fault.

386
00:37:58,465 --> 00:38:02,845
No, they call them accidents
to make the guilty feel better.

387
00:38:02,928 --> 00:38:06,389
- Is that so?
- I don't give a damn what they call them.

388
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,350
My son's dead.

389
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:11,603
Your granddaughter's not.

390
00:38:11,687 --> 00:38:13,689
And neither were you.

391
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:19,194
Have you thought about how she's gonna remember you?

392
00:38:20,028 --> 00:38:25,659
You know, come to think of it,
I don't feel like playing cards tonight.

393
00:38:25,784 --> 00:38:29,413
Put that bottle someplace
where I don't have to look at it.

394
00:39:28,347 --> 00:39:31,558
You know anything about pickup trucks?

395
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:35,312
Aw, shit.

396
00:39:35,437 --> 00:39:40,024
Hand me that half-inch
socket wrench, would you?

397
00:39:40,025 --> 00:39:42,611
No, no, no.
Shiny one on the top.

398
00:39:43,445 --> 00:39:45,114
Yep.

399
00:39:46,365 --> 00:39:48,992
Do you wanna see what I'm doing?

400
00:39:53,372 --> 00:39:55,332
That's it.

401
00:39:57,084 --> 00:39:59,418
- OK, see these screws here?
- Mm-hm.

402
00:39:59,419 --> 00:40:04,383
This one I'm tightening, this holds
this thing up which holds the pan up.

403
00:40:04,508 --> 00:40:08,262
If this thing comes loose when you're
driving, you'll be sitting on the road.

404
00:40:08,387 --> 00:40:11,305
And that's not what you want to be doing...

405
00:40:11,306 --> 00:40:13,475
How come you and Einar don't get along?

406
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,103
You're practically his daughter.

407
00:40:16,186 --> 00:40:18,814
What I am is his dead son's wife.

408
00:40:20,482 --> 00:40:25,070
He's always been really good to me.
He's the first friend I met here.

409
00:40:26,947 --> 00:40:29,741
I am not in the mood for their crap.

410
00:40:30,909 --> 00:40:32,035
I'll take 'em.

411
00:40:34,037 --> 00:40:38,208
- The special today is the enchilada plate.
- Thank you.

412
00:40:38,292 --> 00:40:42,254
They're good enchiladas.
Served by good people.

413
00:40:43,213 --> 00:40:45,174
I'm a good person.

414
00:40:46,216 --> 00:40:51,013
I'm also a woman who's taken more
than her fair share of shit off men.

415
00:40:51,138 --> 00:40:53,223
Don't push me.

416
00:40:53,307 --> 00:40:57,560
I mean, I couldn't even take a pinch of crap
from two little cheesedicks like you.

417
00:40:57,561 --> 00:41:01,440
OK, crank it.

418
00:41:01,565 --> 00:41:03,525
Again.

419
00:41:04,568 --> 00:41:05,903
Again.

420
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,289
Take your foot off the gas.

421
00:41:18,332 --> 00:41:20,626
Take your foot off the gas!

422
00:41:27,424 --> 00:41:29,593
Is that for lunch?

423
00:41:29,718 --> 00:41:32,095
It's for a bear.

424
00:41:32,221 --> 00:41:35,641
Who the hell knows what a bear eats anyway?

425
00:41:50,155 --> 00:41:52,324
Did I ask you to do that?

426
00:41:53,367 --> 00:41:55,451
Don't bears like honey?

427
00:41:55,452 --> 00:41:57,663
Winnie the Pooh does.

428
00:42:15,389 --> 00:42:17,266
- Oh, hey.
- Thought you were sick.

429
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:19,852
Haven't seen you for a few days.

430
00:42:19,935 --> 00:42:25,399
It's only a two-restaurant town, so I try
to spread the county's money around.

431
00:42:26,316 --> 00:42:29,777
Meatloaf. Can I have onion rings
instead of mashed potatoes?

432
00:42:29,778 --> 00:42:32,698
Onion... Sure, I'll ask.

433
00:42:35,909 --> 00:42:38,328
Could you give me a ride home after work?

434
00:42:39,455 --> 00:42:40,914
Sure.

435
00:42:44,793 --> 00:42:47,045
He looks like he's dancing.

436
00:42:47,171 --> 00:42:50,089
Well, maybe just happy to see a girl with a sack of meat.

437
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:53,635
I'll give you some here.
Why don't you toss this in?

438
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:10,527
- He likes the honey.
- I think he does.

439
00:43:10,652 --> 00:43:14,906
Is that really the bear
that hurt Mr. Bradley?

440
00:43:14,907 --> 00:43:17,201
He's the one.

441
00:43:34,218 --> 00:43:36,302
I don't wanna go right home.

442
00:43:36,303 --> 00:43:38,806
- Not just yet.
- You don't?

443
00:43:38,889 --> 00:43:41,266
Can't we just drive a little?

444
00:43:52,569 --> 00:43:55,697
Here's the thing.
I'm gonna be here about three more weeks.

445
00:43:55,781 --> 00:43:58,492
I'm afraid I'm not gonna get through it.

446
00:44:01,078 --> 00:44:03,163
Three weeks, huh?

447
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:08,502
I don't wanna be in love, Crane.

448
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:36,363
Don't start without me.

449
00:44:39,783 --> 00:44:42,910
- What's that?
- A flower.

450
00:44:42,911 --> 00:44:44,997
That's not a flower - it's a weed.

451
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:50,002
It's pretty, though.

452
00:44:50,085 --> 00:44:54,922
- Don't you think it's pretty?
- Yeah, I think it's lovely.

453
00:44:54,923 --> 00:44:57,384
You want to wait a little longer for your mother?

454
00:44:57,509 --> 00:45:00,012
- Just a little bit.
- OK.

455
00:45:05,726 --> 00:45:08,353
I had a music teacher who was a lesbian.

456
00:45:16,153 --> 00:45:18,489
You guys are gay, right?

457
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:28,582
I'd think after 40 years of working together,
one of us would notice, don't you?

458
00:45:28,665 --> 00:45:33,170
Well, Einar, I always thought
you had really lovely hands.

459
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:36,298
You did? You never told me that.

460
00:45:36,423 --> 00:45:40,051
I mean, it's cool.
Everybody needs love.

461
00:45:40,052 --> 00:45:42,471
You got that part right, little girl.

462
00:45:43,597 --> 00:45:45,891
Jeez, what's next?

463
00:45:46,642 --> 00:45:48,519
Hey!

464
00:45:50,479 --> 00:45:54,358
- Hey, yourself. How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

465
00:45:54,441 --> 00:45:58,195
Good. There's somebody
I want you to meet.

466
00:45:59,446 --> 00:46:02,366
Griff, this is Sheriff Curtis.

467
00:46:02,491 --> 00:46:04,660
Nice to meet you, Griff.

468
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,248
- Are you hungry?
- There isn't enough.

469
00:46:09,373 --> 00:46:13,752
I gotta swing back
through town anyway. So I'll see ya.

470
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:17,589
- Thanks for the ride home.
- Take care of yourself, Crane.

471
00:46:19,258 --> 00:46:21,343
- I don't like him.
- I don't remember asking.

472
00:46:21,468 --> 00:46:23,554
I don't remember you ever asking me.

473
00:46:23,637 --> 00:46:26,473
Hey, I don't need your permission.

474
00:46:30,018 --> 00:46:33,147
You confused about how to treat a guest in my house?

475
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:35,315
It's just some guy my mom brought home.

476
00:46:35,441 --> 00:46:39,278
I expect you to be pleasant to whoever comes to my door.

477
00:46:44,283 --> 00:46:45,658
Yes, sir.

478
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:49,204
Unless it's some guy looking to sell his angle on God.

479
00:46:49,288 --> 00:46:52,541
There's no excuse for that bullshit.

480
00:46:55,544 --> 00:47:01,592
Well, all right, then. Let's give a try
at these good-looking sandwiches.

481
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:29,745
There you go.
Hold it right about here.

482
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:30,996
OK.

483
00:47:31,121 --> 00:47:36,001
- His foot's not gonna go anywhere.
- Oh, yes, it is. Look at that calf run.

484
00:47:36,126 --> 00:47:38,003
He's off and gone.

485
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,091
Oops. That's a little bit low.

486
00:47:47,054 --> 00:47:49,765
- Yeah!
- I got it!

487
00:47:51,225 --> 00:47:53,852
- Look at that!
- Oh, yeah.

488
00:47:53,936 --> 00:47:57,606
Go on, try it again.
There you go.

489
00:48:02,402 --> 00:48:05,948
You got any more improvements you wanna make around here?

490
00:48:06,031 --> 00:48:08,241
I thought I'd straighten some of this mess.

491
00:48:08,242 --> 00:48:10,618
Thought Mitch might want to work on something.

492
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:14,581
- Did you ask him about it?
- Well, of course she did.

493
00:48:15,624 --> 00:48:18,669
Now that we've got interesting company around here, I...

494
00:48:18,752 --> 00:48:20,838
I feel inspired.

495
00:48:23,549 --> 00:48:26,051
Excuse me.
I gotta go to work.

496
00:48:39,523 --> 00:48:41,608
You wanna know what I dreamed last night?

497
00:48:41,692 --> 00:48:43,694
What?

498
00:48:43,777 --> 00:48:48,157
I dreamed you weren't such a miserable son of a bitch.

499
00:48:48,907 --> 00:48:52,953
That's not dreaming.
That's wishful thinking.

500
00:48:53,912 --> 00:48:57,875
Did you hear anything unusual last night?

501
00:48:57,958 --> 00:49:02,045
Yeah. Somebody poking around
down by the river.

502
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,591
I found some footprints.

503
00:49:06,925 --> 00:49:08,719
This.

504
00:49:16,518 --> 00:49:18,604
I sure do miss smoking.

505
00:49:19,646 --> 00:49:21,648
So do I.

506
00:49:30,282 --> 00:49:31,325
Hey.

507
00:49:32,367 --> 00:49:35,412
Hey! What are you doing here?

508
00:49:35,496 --> 00:49:39,040
- We're going to Angie's zoo.
- Really?

509
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:41,251
What kind of pies you got today, Nina?

510
00:49:41,335 --> 00:49:45,088
Hey! I got three kinds of berry
and chocolate pecan.

511
00:49:45,214 --> 00:49:48,216
Guaranteed to make your teeth ache.

512
00:49:48,217 --> 00:49:51,886
Chocolate pecan, please.
With ice cream.

513
00:49:51,887 --> 00:49:55,224
Two chocolate pecan, one with ice cream.
Kid's got young teeth.

514
00:49:55,432 --> 00:49:57,392
Coming right up.

515
00:50:00,437 --> 00:50:02,397
Be right back.

516
00:50:02,523 --> 00:50:04,399
Crane.

517
00:50:06,276 --> 00:50:08,654
Einar.

518
00:50:10,948 --> 00:50:13,367
She capture your interest?

519
00:50:14,284 --> 00:50:17,329
Have you thought about the girl?
They're a set.

520
00:50:17,412 --> 00:50:19,706
Can I get you anything else, Crane?

521
00:50:19,832 --> 00:50:21,917
No. Just the check.

522
00:50:23,043 --> 00:50:24,837
OK.

523
00:50:29,716 --> 00:50:34,638
How does the law stand on shooting
somebody on your property?

524
00:50:35,556 --> 00:50:40,268
Well, if you didn't want to go to prison,
they'd have to be in your house.

525
00:50:40,269 --> 00:50:43,689
- That's what I thought.
- You think you got a problem?

526
00:50:43,814 --> 00:50:45,983
I'll let you know.

527
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,530
Hey.

528
00:50:51,613 --> 00:50:54,032
You wanna hand me that rasp?

529
00:50:57,369 --> 00:51:00,164
No, those are pliers.
The rasp, next to...

530
00:51:01,623 --> 00:51:03,834
- This?
- That's it. Yep.

531
00:51:04,751 --> 00:51:07,045
Are there really cowgirls?

532
00:51:09,673 --> 00:51:12,176
Haven't you ever ridden a horse before?

533
00:51:12,259 --> 00:51:16,847
No. There weren't any horses
around Gary's apartment.

534
00:51:18,724 --> 00:51:21,350
He was my mom's boyfriend.

535
00:51:21,351 --> 00:51:23,937
We lived with him for two years.

536
00:51:26,023 --> 00:51:28,858
My mom had another boyfriend before Gary.

537
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:32,696
His name was Hank.
He didn't have any horses either.

538
00:51:33,739 --> 00:51:36,241
Hank didn't hit my mom like Gary did.

539
00:51:36,366 --> 00:51:38,744
He was just mean with his words.

540
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:40,829
Like you.

541
00:51:45,542 --> 00:51:51,673
I can see where not learning to ride a horse
would be a disadvantage for a cowgirl.

542
00:51:51,799 --> 00:51:53,550
- You wanna try?
- Yeah.

543
00:51:53,675 --> 00:51:55,844
Here, grab that blanket.

544
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,572
What's that?

545
00:52:18,158 --> 00:52:20,577
Wanna have a look?

546
00:52:28,293 --> 00:52:30,462
Good afternoon, boy.

547
00:52:34,967 --> 00:52:37,970
Your father was sure first-rate.

548
00:52:38,095 --> 00:52:40,180
I miss him.

549
00:52:41,223 --> 00:52:43,392
I wish I missed him.

550
00:52:47,563 --> 00:52:50,189
You would if you'd known him.

551
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:51,859
Stay.

552
00:53:06,123 --> 00:53:08,750
Your mom's boyfriend in Iowa, he smoke?

553
00:53:10,002 --> 00:53:11,879
Yeah, a lot.

554
00:53:17,718 --> 00:53:20,011
Did he hit you?

555
00:53:20,012 --> 00:53:21,972
Mostly my mom.

556
00:53:23,015 --> 00:53:25,934
Jimmy. Jimmy, no, no.

557
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:35,244
My parents scraped and saved to get us out of El Paso.

558
00:53:35,327 --> 00:53:39,290
To get a quiet place, far away from everything.

559
00:53:41,292 --> 00:53:43,793
Then they put an interstate through it.

560
00:53:43,794 --> 00:53:46,714
This would have killed them.

561
00:53:46,797 --> 00:53:49,717
- I remember your parents.
- You do?

562
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:56,180
- Yeah, they were good people.
- What a mess. Did you know Griffin?

563
00:53:56,181 --> 00:53:57,433
Yeah.

564
00:53:57,558 --> 00:54:01,395
He was two years behind me in high school.

565
00:54:02,771 --> 00:54:04,857
Do you know how he died?

566
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,610
Yeah, it was, uh...

567
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:12,448
Up in Calgary at the stampede.
A car accident.

568
00:54:15,784 --> 00:54:19,037
Guess everybody in town knows that.

569
00:54:19,038 --> 00:54:21,749
Well, it was a long time ago.

570
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,088
I was driving, you know.

571
00:54:32,885 --> 00:54:36,347
Guess everybody in town knows that too.

572
00:54:50,527 --> 00:54:52,905
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

573
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:59,495
Well, I'm not so sure I'm happy
to see you in here, Einar.

574
00:54:59,578 --> 00:55:02,081
How about a club soda, Eileen?

575
00:55:02,206 --> 00:55:04,375
I can do that for you.

576
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:18,555
- I hear you have a granddaughter.
- Yeah. By God, I do.

577
00:55:18,681 --> 00:55:21,057
How old is she?

578
00:55:21,058 --> 00:55:25,853
She's still shiny. She still expects
everything's gonna turn out all right.

579
00:55:25,854 --> 00:55:28,983
- Shit!
- That's a good age.

580
00:55:29,108 --> 00:55:31,610
Here, buy yourself a fucking drink.

581
00:55:31,694 --> 00:55:34,196
You're one lucky son of a bitch.

582
00:55:36,699 --> 00:55:38,909
You know those guys?

583
00:55:38,993 --> 00:55:41,829
The one in the hat is Jed Spear's boy, Josh.

584
00:55:41,912 --> 00:55:44,206
And the other guy?

585
00:55:44,331 --> 00:55:46,917
Some dude from the Midwest.

586
00:56:01,223 --> 00:56:03,183
Einar.

587
00:56:03,309 --> 00:56:06,437
- Her ex-boyfriend's in town.
- Yeah, I know he is.

588
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,814
He's staying down at the Sage Creek Motel.

589
00:56:08,939 --> 00:56:11,025
Why in the hell didn't you arrest him?

590
00:56:11,108 --> 00:56:14,987
'Cause I can't do anything, except keep
an eye on him. Unless he bothers her.

591
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:17,364
Does she know he's here?

592
00:56:17,489 --> 00:56:19,574
I haven't told her yet.

593
00:56:19,575 --> 00:56:23,202
Look, if he'd been out at your place,
I could make that enough.

594
00:56:23,203 --> 00:56:26,248
You'd let me know if he'd been out there bothering you?

595
00:56:26,332 --> 00:56:28,834
Oh, he doesn't bother me one little bit.

596
00:56:31,337 --> 00:56:33,547
Jesus.

597
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:39,887
Here.

598
00:56:53,859 --> 00:56:56,070
Bad news.

599
00:56:56,362 --> 00:56:57,820
Bad news.

600
00:56:57,821 --> 00:56:59,822
That's 15-2,

601
00:56:59,823 --> 00:57:01,367
15-4...

602
00:57:01,492 --> 00:57:06,914
That's two runs of three and a pair which puts me out.

603
00:57:07,623 --> 00:57:12,001
- I haven't had a decent hand all night.
- Well, don't growl. You dealt half of them.

604
00:57:12,002 --> 00:57:14,630
I'm not growling.
Give it here.

605
00:57:18,467 --> 00:57:23,806
- You want some help getting to bed?
- No, I'll manage that.

606
00:57:38,612 --> 00:57:41,115
I always thought this was one of your best.

607
00:57:42,866 --> 00:57:44,743
Why, thank you.

608
00:57:47,663 --> 00:57:52,668
Ever wish you'd lived a different life rather
than living up here and working with me?

609
00:57:52,793 --> 00:57:54,669
No.

610
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:58,299
I was always happy that I found work that suited me.

611
00:57:59,133 --> 00:58:04,138
Since I was a kid, all I ever wanted to be was a cowboy.

612
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,640
Shit.

613
00:58:06,765 --> 00:58:09,768
- How about now?
- Now too.

614
00:58:13,647 --> 00:58:17,192
Mind if I leave Griff here with you
for a while till her mother comes home?

615
00:58:17,276 --> 00:58:19,778
There's an errand in town I'd like to run.

616
00:58:19,904 --> 00:58:24,366
Be all right with me if she stayed up here all the time.

617
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,460
Hey.

618
00:58:27,211 --> 00:58:29,380
Be careful with that errand.

619
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:10,171
Yeah?

620
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:20,890
Take it easy, buddy.
What do you want?

621
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,686
I'm helping you pack.

622
00:59:29,648 --> 00:59:32,151
You don't know how much I love her.

623
00:59:32,276 --> 00:59:36,238
Your love was written all over her face
when she got here.

624
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:40,909
There's nothing more useless than running
after a woman that doesn't want you.

625
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:45,289
She wanted me to find her. If she didn't,
she wouldn't have come back here.

626
00:59:45,414 --> 00:59:47,792
Pull over. Here.

627
01:00:02,723 --> 01:00:06,560
Keep going.
I see you back here again, I'll kill you.

628
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:10,231
You've seen too many westerns, old man.

629
01:00:10,314 --> 01:00:13,025
That doesn't exactly work in your favor.

630
01:00:23,035 --> 01:00:26,163
- You need a ride?
- A ride would be fine.

631
01:00:30,334 --> 01:00:33,378
- That man threaten you?
- Yeah, he sure as hell did.

632
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:36,924
Jean Gilkyson's a friend of mine.
She doesn't want you here.

633
01:00:37,007 --> 01:00:41,095
- You don't know her like I do.
- No, you're right. I don't.

634
01:00:41,178 --> 01:00:45,474
I'll make this simple for you -
I don't want you here.

635
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:49,019
Now, get going.

636
01:01:01,615 --> 01:01:06,203
Is this something we're gonna have to talk a lot about?

637
01:01:06,328 --> 01:01:07,997
No, Einar.

638
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:11,208
We never have to talk about this again.

639
01:01:13,919 --> 01:01:14,879
Jean?

640
01:01:16,213 --> 01:01:17,798
Jean?

641
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:23,721
- What?
- Get dressed. I wanna talk to you.

642
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:35,191
What is it?

643
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:41,655
Just had a chat with your ex-boyfriend.

644
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,866
Thought you oughta know he was in town.

645
01:01:43,949 --> 01:01:46,160
- You mean Gary's here?
- He was.

646
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:51,248
- Gary's in town?
- He left.

647
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:55,127
Well, we should call Crane.

648
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,421
Crane knows all about it.

649
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:02,217
- I'm sorry.
- Tell me something. I'm a little confused.

650
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:05,971
By bachelor number one and bachelor number two.

651
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:10,351
Are you screwing Crane Curtis for protection or sport?

652
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:17,858
Would you like to ask your daughter
how she feels about it?

653
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:20,568
Don't bring Griff into this.
You don't know anything about her.

654
01:02:20,569 --> 01:02:24,407
- And whose fault is that?
- Oh, it's my fault, Einar. Right?

655
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:28,285
Isn't it my fault?
Isn't everything my fault?

656
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,509
Griffin flipped a coin.

657
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:47,138
What are you talking about?

658
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:52,685
Griffin flipped a coin and I lost.

659
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,481
So I was the one driving.

660
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:02,778
It was three o'clock in the morning
and we were both tired.

661
01:03:02,903 --> 01:03:07,365
We wanted to make it down to the rodeo in Great Falls.

662
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:09,577
It was a flipped coin?

663
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:12,997
What was it - a quarter?
Was it a nickel?

664
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:16,333
- I don't remember what it was.
- I wanna know what killed my boy!

665
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:18,627
I killed him, Einar.

666
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:21,047
Is that what you wanna hear?

667
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:24,174
It wasn't the change in our pockets

668
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:27,093
or the weak-ass coffee or the rain.

669
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:29,263
It was me.

670
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:35,728
I fell asleep and I flipped the car six times.

671
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:39,607
I killed Griffin.

672
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,778
You got no argument from me.

673
01:03:45,237 --> 01:03:48,157
You think it's something I forget?

674
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:52,411
You think I'm not sick with it every day of my life?

675
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:58,667
But I tried to keep living and you haven't.

676
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,087
Is that why you hate me so much?

677
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:04,924
You know, you act like I killed you the day Griffin died.

678
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:06,717
Well, great.

679
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:10,054
Lie all the way down and we'll bury you.

680
01:04:10,971 --> 01:04:15,559
What's the matter? You're afraid
no one will come to the funeral?

681
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:20,356
- We'll talk about your leaving tomorrow.
- We're done talking.

682
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:29,175
Just so you know,

683
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,720
I have been trying.

684
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,933
But forgiving...

685
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:42,104
just isn't easy for me.

686
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:48,902
Son of a bitch.
What the hell did he call it?

687
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:53,073
What - does he think he's a preacher
or some goddamn thing?

688
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:55,159
Know-it-all.

689
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:03,084
I'm sorry we woke you up so early.

690
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:06,629
That's OK. I'm not
a great sleeper anyway.

691
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:13,302
Hey, I got a regular mattress out in the storage shed.

692
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:17,139
Maybe you and I can wrestle it in here after work.

693
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,279
Did you drink the whole bottle?

694
01:06:32,988 --> 01:06:37,076
She left. She walked out of here
and took the kid.

695
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,830
That her idea or yours?

696
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:43,833
I didn't drink the whole thing.

697
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:47,503
Which side of your ass you want
the needle in this morning?

698
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:48,838
Left.

699
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:57,722
Well, what'd you dream about last night?

700
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,890
I didn't dream at all.

701
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:06,897
I lay awake all night, wondering if you'd
ever stop blaming the world for whatever.

702
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:11,485
Wondering if you'd be able
to hold on to the family you've got.

703
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:14,697
I managed to hang on to you, didn't I?

704
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:18,784
Have you ever wondered why I'm the only one left?

705
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:24,206
Well, I have my boy.
I have his memories.

706
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:28,461
Yeah.

707
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:32,965
Maybe he'll remember how desperately
he wanted to get out of here.

708
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:36,093
How bad he wanted a life of his own.

709
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:38,888
If you weren't a cripple,
I'd jerk you out and kick your ass.

710
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:41,097
Oh, talk sense.

711
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:45,061
I never saw the day you thought
you could kick my ass, Einar.

712
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:49,523
- Einar!
- What?

713
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:53,611
I wanna go see the bear.

714
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,613
You've seen the bear.

715
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:59,533
- I want you to take me to Angie's.
- You're not up to it.

716
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:02,244
I'm not asking permission, goddammit!
I want a ride!

717
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:03,913
Well, then call a taxi.

718
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:12,253
- I'm going back.
- What?

719
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:15,173
I'm staying with my grandpa
and Mr. Bradley.

720
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:17,385
- The hell you are, Griff.
- Yes, I am.

721
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:19,261
No, you're not!

722
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:21,639
You're not going anywhere.
You're staying right here.

723
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,141
I'm going back, OK?

724
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:30,731
You make decisions like they don't matter
for anybody else but you!

725
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:36,362
That is not true.
I always think about you first.

726
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,990
Then it should start to show.

727
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:49,792
Griff! Get back here!
I'm not gonna say it again.

728
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:51,669
Let her go.

729
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:55,840
Let her go be with her grandfather for a while.

730
01:08:58,884 --> 01:09:01,594
Do you think I'm a shitty mother?

731
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:04,724
I think you're doing the best you can.

732
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:16,819
That's her second-grade picture.

733
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:18,779
Of your daughter?

734
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:20,573
Yeah.

735
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:27,245
We were having a picnic at the river
and she went for a swim.

736
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:29,540
She wanted to practice.

737
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:32,126
She was a great swimmer.

738
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,882
And I, uh...

739
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,885
I looked away for a minute.

740
01:09:42,053 --> 01:09:44,638
And she was... gone.

741
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,351
She was...

742
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:59,987
I would do anything to have that minute back.

743
01:10:01,113 --> 01:10:03,324
But I'm never gonna.

744
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:11,665
- Nina, I'm...
- We're not supposed to outlive our children.

745
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,419
You have to understand that about Einar.

746
01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:29,475
- Where's your mother?
- She's staying with Nina.

747
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:35,022
You walked all the way out here by yourself?

748
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:37,400
I got hungry.

749
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:45,866
Want one egg or two?
We got a lot to do today.

750
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:48,244
How about two?

751
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:56,711
What are we gonna do with that?

752
01:10:56,794 --> 01:11:00,881
You spread it around so we don't have to walk in it.

753
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:06,095
Here, slide on over here and take the wheel.

754
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:08,180
- Come on.
- I can't drive.

755
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:11,100
You're not gonna be driving.
You're gonna be steering.

756
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:13,185
Come on. You can do it.

757
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:18,607
Turn before you get to that fence.
Don't touch anything else.

758
01:11:41,622 --> 01:11:43,165
Yeah.

759
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:46,210
OK.

760
01:11:50,089 --> 01:11:51,423
- Set.
- Yeah.

761
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:53,926
Six o'clock in the morning, I wake up to gunfire.

762
01:11:53,927 --> 01:11:57,387
And I look out the window
and everything's shot to hell in the yard.

763
01:11:57,388 --> 01:11:59,682
- Jonesy, it's pottery.
- Still, man.

764
01:11:59,765 --> 01:12:03,519
Shouldn't you be catching people
who are shooting the neighborhood up?

765
01:12:03,644 --> 01:12:07,481
Why the hell didn't you tell me Gary was in town?

766
01:12:07,606 --> 01:12:09,775
Excuse me.

767
01:12:11,777 --> 01:12:15,947
- I didn't think you'd want to see him.
- Well, I had a right to know.

768
01:12:15,948 --> 01:12:18,534
I just... I would have thought
you'd had enough of him.

769
01:12:18,617 --> 01:12:22,412
Come on, Crane. Why don't you ask me
what you really wanna know?

770
01:12:22,413 --> 01:12:24,873
Why didn't I just walk away the first time he hit me?

771
01:12:24,999 --> 01:12:27,917
Why didn't I just call the police? Right?
It's so simple.

772
01:12:27,918 --> 01:12:32,089
- Crane, are you gonna deal with this?
- Just give me a second here.

773
01:12:32,172 --> 01:12:33,340
Jean.

774
01:12:33,465 --> 01:12:36,677
I couldn't care less about his personal problems.

775
01:13:05,664 --> 01:13:09,125
There's a buffalo over there.
His name is Ronnie.

776
01:13:09,126 --> 01:13:11,628
And then there's two wolves.

777
01:13:11,629 --> 01:13:13,881
Tom and Jerry.

778
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:21,096
Come on. Look.

779
01:13:21,847 --> 01:13:23,807
Food.

780
01:13:25,184 --> 01:13:27,144
Come on.

781
01:13:29,229 --> 01:13:31,440
Aren't you hungry?

782
01:13:34,026 --> 01:13:35,903
You had enough?

783
01:13:37,071 --> 01:13:39,031
Yeah.

784
01:13:40,699 --> 01:13:42,993
Yeah, I've had all I need.

785
01:14:07,726 --> 01:14:10,186
No, no, no, that's OK.

786
01:14:10,187 --> 01:14:15,234
I gotta run to the feed store for a minute.
You think you can fix Mitch some lunch?

787
01:14:15,317 --> 01:14:16,694
Sure.

788
01:14:16,777 --> 01:14:18,779
OK, then.

789
01:14:27,746 --> 01:14:30,124
Einar?

790
01:14:30,249 --> 01:14:32,001
Einar!

791
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:37,298
- Mitch?
- Griff.

792
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:42,218
- Get Einar for me.
- He went to town.

793
01:14:42,219 --> 01:14:44,096
Oh, no.

794
01:14:44,221 --> 01:14:46,807
Do you know where he keeps my medicine?

795
01:14:46,932 --> 01:14:49,309
- In the refrigerator?
- Go get it for me.

796
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:52,771
- Right now?
- Quick as you can.

797
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:54,523
OK.

798
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:10,288
- OK.
- OK. Good girl.

799
01:15:10,289 --> 01:15:13,292
Do you... you know how to load it?

800
01:15:14,543 --> 01:15:17,671
Yeah, just... That's it.

801
01:15:21,008 --> 01:15:22,676
OK.

802
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:34,772
Pull the pants down,
stick it in me and push the plunger down.

803
01:15:55,209 --> 01:15:57,586
Was that OK?

804
01:16:01,048 --> 01:16:05,010
It was so smooth, I thought my mom had done it.

805
01:16:08,264 --> 01:16:09,932
Thank you.

806
01:16:15,646 --> 01:16:17,648
Hey.

807
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:21,569
Jean.

808
01:16:23,362 --> 01:16:27,825
As it turns out, you're right.
I'm a complete asshole.

809
01:16:30,661 --> 01:16:33,789
I never judged you for being with him, though.

810
01:16:33,914 --> 01:16:36,000
You're wrong about that.

811
01:16:36,709 --> 01:16:39,211
You made it stop.
You left him.

812
01:16:45,884 --> 01:16:49,013
You wanna know the ugly little truth?

813
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:56,312
You stay because you don't think you deserve any better.

814
01:16:57,479 --> 01:17:00,899
'Cause you think it's the best you can do.

815
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,877
It's Mr. Bradley.

816
01:17:30,930 --> 01:17:32,932
How you doing?

817
01:17:33,766 --> 01:17:36,894
We can't just leave him there, Einar.

818
01:17:39,271 --> 01:17:41,774
We walked into his business.

819
01:17:42,816 --> 01:17:46,277
Hell, he was just doing what bears do.

820
01:17:46,278 --> 01:17:48,781
We can't punish him for that.

821
01:17:51,992 --> 01:17:55,120
You got to let him go, Einar.

822
01:17:55,246 --> 01:17:57,498
Get him out of that cage.

823
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:02,962
Don't you lie here and think I can do that.

824
01:18:12,638 --> 01:18:16,517
You know, I can get myself shaved in the morning.

825
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,395
- All the way dressed too.
- OK.

826
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:25,276
Could probably manage to stick myself
in the butt with one of those syringes.

827
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:30,781
But what I can't do is continue
to lie here every day and watch you mourn

828
01:18:30,864 --> 01:18:34,243
for a life you think you should have had.

829
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:44,878
There are people everywhere
who think they got dealt a bad hand, Einar.

830
01:18:57,032 --> 01:18:58,742
Hey.

831
01:18:59,576 --> 01:19:01,453
Did I give him too much?

832
01:19:01,537 --> 01:19:03,622
No.

833
01:19:03,747 --> 01:19:05,916
You did great today.

834
01:19:28,647 --> 01:19:30,399
Goddamn bear.

835
01:19:35,529 --> 01:19:37,614
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

836
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:41,702
I never do anything right.

837
01:19:46,915 --> 01:19:49,168
Well, what do you think?

838
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:03,057
Attagirl.

839
01:20:05,684 --> 01:20:09,730
- Right, let's try third. Let the clutch out.
- Third?

840
01:20:09,855 --> 01:20:12,649
Now, let's go to the left.

841
01:20:12,775 --> 01:20:14,860
Not too hard.

842
01:20:15,694 --> 01:20:19,656
OK, that's good.
You're getting the hang of it.

843
01:20:21,492 --> 01:20:25,496
There you go. I think we're
gonna get this thing done.

844
01:20:25,996 --> 01:20:29,248
Hey, Griff.
How's life on the ranch?

845
01:20:29,249 --> 01:20:31,418
It's good.

846
01:20:31,543 --> 01:20:34,546
Jean, you got two customers out here.

847
01:20:37,591 --> 01:20:38,925
Hey.

848
01:20:38,926 --> 01:20:42,471
- We're just visiting, OK?
- OK.

849
01:20:48,519 --> 01:20:52,481
I miss you.
What you been doing?

850
01:20:52,606 --> 01:20:54,692
Einar's been teaching me how to drive.

851
01:20:54,775 --> 01:21:00,405
Why don't you go look to see
what Nina's got in the kitchen for special?

852
01:21:00,406 --> 01:21:02,408
- OK?
- OK.

853
01:21:06,245 --> 01:21:09,164
Would you care if I took her camping?

854
01:21:09,289 --> 01:21:12,501
Thanks for bringing her in, Einar.

855
01:21:14,294 --> 01:21:17,631
- Did she say driving?
- It's a ranch.

856
01:21:17,715 --> 01:21:20,551
- She's 11.
- I know, I know. She...

857
01:21:21,593 --> 01:21:24,054
But she's a good girl.

858
01:21:26,265 --> 01:21:29,601
Good kids don't get that way by accident.

859
01:21:36,275 --> 01:21:40,654
- Is that a compliment?
- It's just the way it is.

860
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:48,787
What else you been teaching her?

861
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,750
I don't know enough

862
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:56,378
to know what to teach a girl.

863
01:21:58,589 --> 01:22:00,674
What I'm saying...

864
01:22:02,051 --> 01:22:04,845
is if you wanna come back to the ranch, that's...

865
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:07,264
that's gonna be OK.

866
01:22:15,397 --> 01:22:17,983
Maybe tomorrow then, when you get back.

867
01:22:20,194 --> 01:22:22,905
Tomorrow would be fine.

868
01:22:23,947 --> 01:22:26,617
I think camping would be great.

869
01:22:26,742 --> 01:22:28,952
She'll love that.

870
01:22:35,501 --> 01:22:39,129
- Do you want all of these?
- Yep, all of 'em. Hold on to those.

871
01:22:39,254 --> 01:22:41,130
What's the medicine for?

872
01:22:41,131 --> 01:22:43,966
When we get that bear in the cage,
I'm gonna give him a shot.

873
01:22:43,967 --> 01:22:48,347
That way, he can sleep all the way up to the mountain.

874
01:23:01,694 --> 01:23:03,986
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

875
01:23:03,987 --> 01:23:06,907
- Jesus Christ, Gary.
- How are ya?

876
01:23:10,661 --> 01:23:12,830
God, you look great.

877
01:23:15,958 --> 01:23:18,043
I thought you left town.

878
01:23:18,877 --> 01:23:22,006
Well, I wanted to see you.

879
01:23:22,131 --> 01:23:24,216
You know I miss you.

880
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:30,139
I don't want you here, Gary.
Can't you understand that?

881
01:23:34,852 --> 01:23:38,814
Must be nice for Griff,
living up here with her grandfather.

882
01:23:38,897 --> 01:23:41,525
Country living and all.

883
01:23:41,608 --> 01:23:44,445
Of course, it's not for you.

884
01:23:44,528 --> 01:23:46,613
Just give it up, Gary.

885
01:23:47,448 --> 01:23:49,867
I'm not coming back to you.

886
01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:53,495
Can we just at least sit down?
Have a drink or some kind of...

887
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:56,206
Offer me a coffee or some...

888
01:24:02,546 --> 01:24:06,008
It's pretty country up here.

889
01:24:06,133 --> 01:24:08,427
Might stick around a while.

890
01:24:38,332 --> 01:24:40,541
We're gonna get caught.

891
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:43,337
These are government guys we're stealing this from.

892
01:24:43,462 --> 01:24:46,674
They went home to dinner a long time ago.

893
01:24:47,633 --> 01:24:50,219
I thought you said we're just borrowing it.

894
01:24:50,344 --> 01:24:54,682
As long as I pay my taxes,
it's the same thing. Let's go.

895
01:25:26,296 --> 01:25:30,259
OK, now scoot on over and get ready to back up.

896
01:25:33,178 --> 01:25:35,806
Come on ahead. Easy.

897
01:25:35,889 --> 01:25:37,891
Come on.

898
01:25:42,896 --> 01:25:44,982
Whoa.

899
01:25:45,065 --> 01:25:46,316
OK.

900
01:26:07,087 --> 01:26:09,048
Here.

901
01:26:12,301 --> 01:26:14,178
Hold that still.

902
01:26:14,261 --> 01:26:17,806
- When I tell you, you start cranking.
- OK.

903
01:26:35,741 --> 01:26:39,703
- I'm a little bit scared.
- That makes two of us.

904
01:26:40,454 --> 01:26:42,623
Start cranking.

905
01:27:02,768 --> 01:27:05,020
OK, now get in the truck.

906
01:27:19,618 --> 01:27:22,037
OK.

907
01:27:38,012 --> 01:27:39,888
Come on.

908
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:09,918
Einar!

909
01:28:10,002 --> 01:28:12,628
- Get behind me. Get behind me.
- Einar, I'm sorry.

910
01:28:12,629 --> 01:28:14,590
Get in the truck.

911
01:28:16,258 --> 01:28:19,928
Walk slowly and don't look right at him.
Get in the truck!

912
01:28:22,181 --> 01:28:23,891
Go on.

913
01:28:28,145 --> 01:28:30,356
Look here.

914
01:28:52,127 --> 01:28:55,673
- Einar!
- Wait a minute. Oh, shit.

915
01:28:57,049 --> 01:28:59,343
Are you OK?

916
01:28:59,426 --> 01:29:02,471
I think that he went through an artery.

917
01:29:04,431 --> 01:29:08,185
I think you'd better get me to a hospital.

918
01:29:13,190 --> 01:29:15,693
- Oh!
- Sorry.

919
01:29:21,532 --> 01:29:23,617
Hello?

920
01:29:25,202 --> 01:29:27,162
What?

921
01:29:29,164 --> 01:29:31,959
I was just trying to pull... Oh!

922
01:29:32,042 --> 01:29:35,169
Pull the, uh, loft door down.

923
01:29:35,170 --> 01:29:37,506
You know, to keep the bats out.

924
01:29:37,589 --> 01:29:40,009
'Cause once those bats get in the rafters,

925
01:29:40,092 --> 01:29:43,846
then you can't hardly get 'em out.

926
01:29:45,014 --> 01:29:46,974
And that's when he fell.

927
01:29:47,808 --> 01:29:50,102
Right. That's when I fell.

928
01:29:50,936 --> 01:29:53,939
It was just dumb.
I didn't know what the hell I was doing.

929
01:29:54,064 --> 01:29:57,609
- Let's try this again, Einar.
- Hmm? Oh, Jesus, no...

930
01:30:03,866 --> 01:30:06,285
I hit the gearshift.

931
01:30:08,454 --> 01:30:11,373
- I didn't mean to.
- It wasn't your fault.

932
01:30:13,042 --> 01:30:15,252
It was an accident.

933
01:30:21,383 --> 01:30:24,928
You did everything just right tonight.

934
01:30:25,054 --> 01:30:27,556
As well as your dad could have done.

935
01:31:31,578 --> 01:31:34,998
I guess God kept me alive to bring her into the world.

936
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:38,544
But every day, I wish...

937
01:31:39,378 --> 01:31:44,091
I wish it was me that died
in that car instead of Griffin.

938
01:31:48,345 --> 01:31:50,848
I wish you both had lived.

939
01:32:00,774 --> 01:32:05,446
I was fallen-down drunk
the night that Mitch got mauled.

940
01:32:06,488 --> 01:32:10,993
That's why I couldn't get the bear off him before I did.

941
01:32:13,495 --> 01:32:16,081
He never said anything about it.

942
01:32:16,206 --> 01:32:18,292
He never would.

943
01:32:31,013 --> 01:32:32,973
You.

944
01:32:47,279 --> 01:32:49,865
I'm not just gonna lie down here.

945
01:33:10,302 --> 01:33:13,013
Just keep going.

946
01:33:41,583 --> 01:33:44,211
Heard you made a hell of a fall, Einar.

947
01:33:44,294 --> 01:33:47,131
You're lucky you only cracked two ribs.

948
01:33:47,214 --> 01:33:49,842
It was the soft part of the yard.

949
01:33:51,093 --> 01:33:52,553
- Am I finished?
- Not yet.

950
01:33:52,554 --> 01:33:56,598
I'm going to keep you here for a little bit,
make sure your spleen's OK.

951
01:33:56,724 --> 01:33:58,600
Ah, I'm fine.

952
01:33:58,684 --> 01:34:02,021
Well, I'll check back on you this afternoon.

953
01:34:02,146 --> 01:34:04,857
So you can double-bill me?

954
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:08,067
Seems fair to me.
You are twice the trouble.

955
01:34:08,068 --> 01:34:10,779
Let's give it a day or two, OK?

956
01:34:10,904 --> 01:34:12,865
Hmm.

957
01:34:12,990 --> 01:34:15,701
Couple of days.
That's bullshit.

958
01:34:44,688 --> 01:34:46,565
Einar?

959
01:34:47,399 --> 01:34:48,441
OK?

960
01:34:48,442 --> 01:34:51,778
Yeah, I'm fine. Got clumsy.

961
01:34:51,779 --> 01:34:53,739
Mitch.

962
01:34:54,990 --> 01:34:57,618
Mitch, we set the bear free.

963
01:35:00,329 --> 01:35:02,289
I know.

964
01:35:03,248 --> 01:35:05,209
Thank you.

965
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:20,973
You want me to run some breakfast out to Mitch?

966
01:35:20,974 --> 01:35:25,354
No. Usually coffee's enough
for him in the morning.

967
01:35:27,731 --> 01:35:29,817
You know,

968
01:35:29,942 --> 01:35:31,902
she could go to school here.

969
01:35:34,196 --> 01:35:36,407
Not a bad school.

970
01:36:11,108 --> 01:36:13,110
Whoa, Jimmy.

971
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:07,122
Stay there.

972
01:37:09,416 --> 01:37:13,879
- What do you want, Gary?
- It's time to come home, baby.

973
01:37:18,384 --> 01:37:20,552
I love you, Jean.

974
01:37:22,137 --> 01:37:24,306
You love me?

975
01:37:26,725 --> 01:37:30,353
- That's what your love feels like.
- You bitch!

976
01:37:30,354 --> 01:37:32,356
- Mom!
- Don't you ever hit me!

977
01:37:32,439 --> 01:37:34,525
- Mom!
- Don't you hit me!

978
01:37:34,650 --> 01:37:37,569
- Mom, are you OK? Mom! Mom!
- Come on.

979
01:37:37,653 --> 01:37:40,780
- Mom! Mom!
- Let her go, Gary!

980
01:37:40,781 --> 01:37:43,283
- Let go of me.
- Are you coming or staying?

981
01:37:43,409 --> 01:37:45,703
Hey! Take your hands off her!

982
01:37:45,786 --> 01:37:48,288
What the hell?

983
01:37:49,456 --> 01:37:51,834
Get in the car.
Get in there!

984
01:37:53,293 --> 01:37:55,921
Griff, get out of the car.

985
01:37:56,005 --> 01:37:58,298
- Griff! Griff, goddammit!
- Griff!

986
01:37:58,424 --> 01:37:59,967
Mom!

987
01:38:00,509 --> 01:38:02,594
Mom!

988
01:38:07,891 --> 01:38:09,977
Come on.

989
01:38:14,148 --> 01:38:15,524
Mom.

990
01:38:16,567 --> 01:38:18,736
- Come on.
- Mom.

991
01:38:23,866 --> 01:38:26,785
- It's enough, Einar.
- Mom.

992
01:38:50,976 --> 01:38:54,520
You leave her alone.
Now, come on here. Come on, get.

993
01:38:54,521 --> 01:38:57,316
Get out of here. Get away,
you greedy little bugger.

994
01:38:57,441 --> 01:39:01,695
- She didn't do anything to you.
- That's Mitchell. He's a boy.

995
01:39:03,989 --> 01:39:05,657
Yep.

996
01:39:07,451 --> 01:39:09,410
Come on.

997
01:39:09,411 --> 01:39:11,914
Get outta... Goddamn...

998
01:39:13,582 --> 01:39:16,502
Loma.
Loma, Nebraska.

999
01:39:39,858 --> 01:39:43,820
So what about you, Mitch?
You know anything about this?

1000
01:39:43,821 --> 01:39:46,031
About what?

1001
01:39:47,908 --> 01:39:51,244
So you don't know anything about it?

1002
01:39:51,245 --> 01:39:53,539
I just drove him home from the hospital.

1003
01:39:53,622 --> 01:39:55,833
Mm-hm. Of course. Right.

1004
01:39:55,916 --> 01:39:57,918
Hello, Officer Curtis.

1005
01:39:58,002 --> 01:40:00,504
Good afternoon there, Griff.

1006
01:40:01,255 --> 01:40:03,132
Einar.

1007
01:40:03,215 --> 01:40:05,634
Would you stay for lunch today?

1008
01:40:05,718 --> 01:40:07,720
Yeah, I might.

1009
01:40:07,803 --> 01:40:13,142
I gotta speak to your grandfather
for a second, though, first.

1010
01:40:16,061 --> 01:40:20,107
Ah, heck. It can wait.
Here, let me grab that for you.

1011
01:40:20,232 --> 01:40:22,316
So, how was she today?
Looks good, huh?

1012
01:40:22,317 --> 01:40:25,863
- Yeah? Did you do the milking?
- Yeah.

1013
01:40:29,283 --> 01:40:31,702
Think it might rain today.

1014
01:40:34,621 --> 01:40:36,999
No, it's gonna stay warm.

1015
01:40:37,124 --> 01:40:42,629
I didn't say anything about the
temperature. I said it might rain.

1016
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,636
Would you bury me next to Griffin?

1017
01:40:53,807 --> 01:40:56,935
Don't you think you oughta die first?

1018
01:40:59,313 --> 01:41:01,939
It's gonna happen, you know.

1019
01:41:01,940 --> 01:41:07,863
Where the hell else do you think
I'd bury you? It's where my family lies.

1020
01:41:10,157 --> 01:41:14,536
You think the dead really care about our lives?

1021
01:41:14,661 --> 01:41:17,455
Yeah, I think they do.

1022
01:41:17,456 --> 01:41:20,292
I think they forgive us our sins.

1023
01:41:22,169 --> 01:41:24,755
I even think it's easy for them.

1024
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:31,345
Griff said you had a dream about flying.

1025
01:41:31,428 --> 01:41:33,430
Yeah.

1026
01:41:34,473 --> 01:41:36,433
I got so high, Einar,

1027
01:41:36,558 --> 01:41:39,895
I could see where the blue turns to black.

1028
01:41:41,146 --> 01:41:44,566
From up there, you could see all there is.

1029
01:41:45,401 --> 01:41:49,780
And it looked like there was a reason for everything.
