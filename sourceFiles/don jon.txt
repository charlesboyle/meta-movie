1
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,771
<i>Yo, not gonna lie.</i>

2
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,002
<i>- This sound...</i>

3
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,845
<i>gets me hard as a fucking rock.</i>

4
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,761
<i>But I don't like to go too fast
right off the bat.</i>

5
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,245
<i>I'd rather work my way into it,
nice and easy.</i>

6
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,368
<i>So I'll start off with
some stills.</i>

7
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,129
<i>Then, once I'm getting into it,</i>

8
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,964
<i>I start looking for</i> a <i>video.</i>

9
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,247
<i>I never actually touch my cock
till I find the right clip.</i>

10
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,164
<i>Then, once I do...</i>

11
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,129
<i>...goodbye</i>

12
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,402
<i>For the next few minutes,
all the bullshit fades away,</i>

13
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,730
<i>and the only thing in the world
is those tits...</i>

14
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,450
<i>...that ass...</i>

15
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,561
<i>...the blowjob, the cowboy,</i>

16
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,281
<i>the doggy, the moneyshot, and that's it.
I don't gotta say anything,</i>

17
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,924
<i>I don't gotta do anything.
I just fucking lose myself.</i>

18
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,287
<i>There's only a few things
I really care about in life.</i>

19
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,486
<i>My body...</i>

20
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,486
<i>...my pad...</i>

21
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,731
<i>...my ride...</i>

22
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,690
<i>...my family...</i>

23
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,887
Amen.

24
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,121
<i>...my church...</i>

25
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,963
<i>- ...my boys...</i>

26
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,247
<i>...my girls...</i>

27
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,683
<i>...and my porn.</i>

28
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,405
<i>I know that last one sounds weird,
but I'm just being honest.</i>

29
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,769
<i>Nothing else does it for me the same way.
Not even real pussy.</i>

30
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,207
<i>And, yo, I get plenty of that.</i>

31
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,408
<i>Why you think my boys
call me The Don?</i>

32
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,087
- Jonny-Boy!
- Don Jon, what's good, baby?

33
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,241
- What up?
- You good?

34
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,970
- I'm all right.
- Jonny, look at me.

35
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,849
- Everything good with you?
- What's the matter with this guy?

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,287
- Come here, you animal!
- Get the fuck off of me!

37
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,011
Real talk, real talk. Purple.

38
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,401
- That's not bad.
- It's better than "not bad."

39
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,682
- You ain't see her turn around.
- You calling her a seven?

40
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,649
- An eight. At least an eight.
- That is not an eight.

41
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,610
She's cute in the face, you can maybe
call the face an eight, tits are a four.

42
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,401
Yeah, but the butt, man, it's exceptional.
I'm telling you. It changes everything.

43
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,164
- Shit!
- What?

44
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,886
- Sequins. Don't look. Don't look.
- What? Who is that?

45
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,202
- You don't remember her?
- She's coming over here.

46
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,761
'Cause you're staring right at her.

47
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,724
- Look who the fuck it is.
- How you doing?

48
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,327
- Why didn't you call me back?
- Come on. You're a grown woman.

49
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,608
Did you think I was
gonna call you back?

50
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,446
You're pathetic, you know that?
Every week you got a new bitch.

51
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,247
Then Why'd you come home with me?

52
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,161
Fuck you!

53
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,005
- Eight.
- No, that might be a nine.

54
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,162
- You shitting me? That's a seven.
- You're out of your fucking mind!

55
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,721
I gave you the eight,
your record's intact. Chill out.

56
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,609
You heard what she said?
Everyone knows about the streak.

57
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,127
- You're sick. You know that?
- I don't know what's wrong with me.

58
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,884
- Oh, my... damn!
- What? What? Where?

59
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,123
- Red.
- Holy shit! That's a dime.

60
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,926
- That is a dime.
- Nah, she's hot, but it's not a dime.

61
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,845
I don't even mess with blondes like that,
but that there is a dime!

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,843
- Fuck yeah.
- I don't know, there might be

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,809
- some lasagna up in there.
- I don't think so.

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,287
Definitely not. She keep her
shit tight, you can tell.

65
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,681
- No. I don't know.
- See, he likes that skinny shit.

66
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,844
He likes that skinny, high-fashion,
looks-like-a-boy shit.

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,126
- Fuck you!
- Admit it!

68
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,602
- He's kind of right, man, you do.
- I don't like more than a handful of titty.

69
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,328
No, no, no, no, no. No. A nice handful,
I love it, but more than that, it's like no!

70
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,562
Shit starts to remind me
of my mom or something.

71
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,326
- Jesus Christ.
- Your mom do got some big-ass titties.

72
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,488
- Don't talk about my mother.
- You brought up your mother.

73
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,927
If you don't like that,
there's something wrong with you.

74
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,242
I didn't say I didn't like it.
I said it's not a dime.

75
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,841
- That's incorrect.
- She's taller than you anyway.

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,002
- Fuck you, Jonny.
- I'm playing, come on.

77
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,441
You gonna get that?

78
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,326
Let me get a vodka-cranberry.

79
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,329
Jonny!
- Sammy-boy, how you doing?

80
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,006
- You good?
- Let me get a Grey Goose and soda.

81
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,760
- What makes you think you could do that?
- Do what?

82
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,048
- Get the fuck out of here.
- You wanna go somewhere?

83
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,884
- Fuck you.
- You wanna fuck me?

84
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,690
- Is that why you kissed me?
- I didn't kiss you.

85
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,171
Yeah, you did.

86
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,290
Stop it, I mean it. Stop it.

87
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,920
Come on. Let me buy you a drink.
It's early.

88
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,970
- Where you going?
- I told you where I was going.

89
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,401
Come on! Wait a minute!

90
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,607
Shit!

91
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,882
Yo. Headband.

92
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,930
Nah, I don't know.

93
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,044
<i>See?
This is what I'm saying.</i>

94
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,965
<i>Real pussy's all good.
But I'm sorry.</i>

95
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,691
<i>It's not as good as porn.</i>

96
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,171
<i>Tits?</i>

97
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,165
<i>Great.</i>

98
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,651
<i>Ass?</i>

99
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,211
<i>Great.</i>

100
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,044
<i>Blow-job</i>

101
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,762
<i>Sure, it's fucking fantastic
in person... if she'll do it.</i>

102
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,770
<i>But in real life, if you wanna get head,
you gotta give head.</i>

103
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,531
Lower. Not that low!

104
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,127
<i>I know, some guys love eating pussy,
but the thing about those guys is,</i>

105
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,611
<i>they're fucking crazy.</i>

106
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,725
<i>Don't get me wrong,</i>
<i>I like a good pussy-eating clip.</i>

107
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,771
<i>But, from down here,
there's nothing good about this.</i>

108
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,804
<i>And if she does finally decide
to do you the big favor...</i>

109
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,326
<i>...she's in a fucking hurry.</i>

110
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,927
<i>Now, when it comes to
the actual fucking...</i>

111
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,924
<i>First of all, condoms are terrible.
They just are.</i>

112
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,724
<i>But you gotta wear one, 'cause,</i>

113
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,601
<i>- unlike porn, real pussy can kill you.</i>

114
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,971
<i>Second of all, missionary is the
worst position in all of fucking.</i>

115
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,442
<i>The tits lie flat,
you can't see her ass,</i>

116
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,007
<i>you can't touch her ass,
'cause she's lying on her back.</i>

117
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,290
<i>They won't let you do it from behind,
'cause they wanna look at you.</i>

118
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,731
<i>And basically it's on
me to do all the work.</i>

119
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,248
<i>Moneyshot? No.
There is no real-life moneyshot.</i>

120
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,808
<i>Real girls won't do that shit. You just
gotta cum into the fucking condom.</i>

121
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,923
<i>So, you tell me,
which looks better?</i>

122
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,724
<i>This?</i>

123
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,730
<i>Or this?</i>

124
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,686
Jesus! What are you fucking retarded?!
You're fucking retarded!

125
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,687
You're a retarded person
and you're driving a fucking car!

126
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,571
<i>In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i>

127
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,485
<i>- Amen. Bless you, my son.
- Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>

128
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,483
<i>It has been one week
since my last confession.</i>

129
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,962
- Tell me your sins.
- Since last Sunday, I had sexual relations

130
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,967
out of wedlock two times. I also watched
pornographic videos and masturbated 17 times.

131
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,202
For these and all the sins
of my life, I am sorry.

132
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,931
- Ten Lord's Prayers and ten Hail Marys.
- Thank you, Father.

133
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,606
<i>Through the ministry of the Church,
may God give you pardon and peace,</i>

134
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,969
and I absolve you from your sins in the name
of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

135
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,121
Amen.

136
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,120
Bullshit! Bullshit! Did you see that?
That was fucking bullshit. Bad call.

137
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,164
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- Jon!

138
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,608
- Fucking bullshit. Did you see that?
- Nah, I didn't see it. What happened?

139
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,285
They'll do a replay.
They better do a fucking replay.

140
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,250
Unless they just don't want us
to see how bad that fucking call was.

141
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,209
Why don't you get the thing
where you can pause...

142
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,442
- Assholes, where's the replay?!
- Dad, there's a thing you can pause

143
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,284
- and rewind.
- What are you talking about?

144
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,044
It's digital.
You just rewind and watch it.

145
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,726
- I'm not taping this.
- No, I know you're not taping it.

146
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,123
- Are you people serious, no fucking replay?!
- I'm not talking about a VCR.

147
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,362
How do I know what the fuck
you're talking about?

148
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,091
I don't know, I guess 'cause most
American people have heard of TiVo.

149
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,561
Most people that pay attention
to the world around them!

150
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,882
Here it is.
Shut up already, finally. Shit!

151
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,761
- You seriously never heard of that?
- Yes! I've heard of it, Jesus fucking...

152
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,970
There! Look, his foot's on the line!
Look at that bullshit!

153
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,487
- Jon! All right already!
- So if you've heard of it,

154
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,926
- what is it?
- Did you see that?

155
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,487
- I'm asking you a question.
- It's a fucking thing...

156
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,450
Wait a minute. Did you see that?
I'm asking you.

157
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,489
- Did you?
- Nah, I didn't see it.

158
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,369
Why not?! What the fuck's
the matter with you?

159
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,241
I said look at this play,
I said it right to you!

160
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,085
I ask you to do the easiest fucking
thing, and you can't do it!

161
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,084
- At least I know what a fucking TiVo is.
- I know what a fucking TiVo is!

162
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,890
You want a TiVo?
Is that what you're saying?

163
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,008
- I would love a fucking TiVo.
- Who do you love?

164
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,131
He loves TiVo. He sure as shit
don't love football. We know that.

165
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,764
One of these days, I'm gonna sit down here
and start eating, and you're gonna say,

166
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,604
- "Mom, I found her."
Ma!

167
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,125
One of these days.

168
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,407
Holy Mary... Mother of God...

169
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,688
...pray for us now...

170
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,848
...and at the hour of death...

171
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,324
Amen.

172
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,921
Hail Mary... full of grace...

173
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,730
<i>All right, I'll admit,</i>

174
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,484
<i>there are some downsides.</i>

175
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,167
<i>Like there's the times you
find a great clip, with a hot chick.</i>

176
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,684
<i>And right when you're starting to cum,
it shows the guy.</i>

177
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,525
Fuck! Goddamn it!

178
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,810
<i>It's no one's fault, really,
but it still sucks. So...</i>

179
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,043
<i>Also, nowadays you got so much</i>

180
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,330
<i>to choose from, finding just the
right clip can take a lot of time.</i>

181
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,209
<i>And my time is precious to me.</i>

182
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,648
<i>Yeah, I got shit to do. So...</i>

183
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,168
<i>And, every once in a while,</i>

184
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,564
<i>you find a clip that's so good,
it's fucking depressing.</i>

185
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,644
<i>And you're thinking to yourself,
why can't real pussy be like this?</i>

186
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,849
<i>You know, I smash new girls
all the fucking time,</i>

187
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,482
<i>always an eight or better, and it's still</i>
<i>never this good. What am I doing wrong?</i>

188
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,283
<i>Maybe it's time to
try something new. So...</i>

189
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,986
Yo, you remember that
dime from last week?

190
00:14:24,012 --> 00:14:24,631
Oh, shit.

191
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,326
The blonde in the dress?
She was insane, bro. You hit that?

192
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,404
No, I didn't, you fucking alcoholic,
I saw you after she left.

193
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,801
- Fuck you, Jonny!
- I thought you made that happen.

194
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,769
- I threw it to this other random.
- Typical.

195
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,649
- Probably an eight or nine.
- Six or seven.

196
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,723
Shut the fuck up!
Who'd you take home, huh?

197
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,044
Twos and threes, baby. I'm telling you, twos
and threes are some open-minded ladies.

198
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,010
- I wanna find that girl.
- You get her name?

199
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,845
- Her name?
- First and last name.

200
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,606
I'm looking for her name,
first and last name.

201
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,728
Shit, I don't know.
You know who would?

202
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,363
- Barbara Sugarman.
- Sugarman?

203
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,851
Thanks, bro.

204
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,520
- OK, what was it again?
- Barbara Sugarman.

205
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,400
- You see her anywhere?
- No.

206
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,844
- Oh, shit!
- That's her?

207
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,129
- That's definitely her.
- Oh! Got you, bitch!

208
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,169
What you wanna say?
You gotta say something.

209
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,687
- Really?
- A girl that bad gets mad friend requests.

210
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,811
- Fuck!
- I think it's dinner. Maybe even lunch.

211
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,042
Might have to take this girl
out for coffee.

212
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,964
- Christ!
- Yeah, this is the long game.

213
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,647
You're not getting that butt from Barbara
Sugarman anytime in the immediate future.

214
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,325
If you had it like that,
it would have went down.

215
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,926
You're right.
You're totally right. Shit!

216
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,329
I know, I was about to say, the mighty
Don bringing out the long game?

217
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,687
- She's a dime, but...
- This girl's more than a dime.

218
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,367
Come on, son. There's no such thing, that's
the point, it's a scale from one to ten.

219
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,329
- I'm saying, this girl...
- Oh, my God!

220
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,565
- You in love with this girl already?
- Go fuck yourself.

221
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,764
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

222
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,367
- Yeah, two for lunch.
- Sure. Right this way.

223
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,281
Hey.

224
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,127
- How are you?
- Good. Good. How you been?

225
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,568
- How did you get my Facebook?
- Oh. Getting right to it.

226
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,529
- Yeah.
- I just looked up your name.

227
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,570
- I didn't tell you my name.
- Obviously you did, 'cause I looked it up.

228
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,200
- No, I definitely did not tell you my name.
- Yeah, you did.

229
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,204
- I think I would remember.
- No offense, but you were pretty wasted

230
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,567
- the other night. So was I.
- Can I get you some drinks?

231
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,051
- Diet Coke, please.
- A Coke.

232
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,761
Coke and a Diet Coke.
I'll be right back to take your order.

233
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,210
I had a few drinks the other night,

234
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,840
so I may not have remembered
telling you my first name,

235
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,128
but I definitely did not
tell you my last name.

236
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,169
- I'm telling you... Hey!
- Don't lie to me.

237
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,210
Look, you don't know me, so I'm gonna
let you off the hook this time.

238
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,842
But trust me, in the future you'll be much
happier if you always tell me the truth.

239
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,923
Wait, wait, wait, I'll be happier?

240
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,527
You don't think I could make you happy
if I wanted to?

241
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,524
So how did you find out my name?

242
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,648
- I asked around.
- You asked around about me?

243
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,644
- Yeah.
- That's interesting.

244
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,484
- Why?
- Why? What do you mean why?

245
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,927
- Why did you ask around about me?
- 'Cause I wanted to.

246
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,770
- You wanted to take me to lunch?
- Yeah.

247
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,446
- Don't lie.
- OK, I asked around about you

248
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,921
'cause I wanna fuck your brains out.
Is that what you want me to say?

249
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,086
- Well, at least you're being honest now.
- Let me ask you a question.

250
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,449
Why did you come here, huh?
Why did you say yes to me?

251
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,409
- That's a very good question.
- Yeah, so?

252
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,164
You're gonna have
to wait to find out.

253
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,971
- All right. I got time.
- Really? You got time?

254
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,009
It seemed like you were
in a big hurry the other day.

255
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,685
I can be that way
when I'm shit-faced.

256
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,011
You're cute, I like you.

257
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,083
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

258
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,721
Listen, you wanna know the truth?

259
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,565
This is the truth.

260
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,644
You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen in my life.

261
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,808
You like movies?

262
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,488
<i>I don't watch too many movies.</i>

263
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,504
<i>I used to watch 'em a
lot when I was a little</i>

264
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,992
<i>kid, before I could get
my hands on any porn.</i>

265
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,195
<i>Back then, if I wanted
to see a really hot</i>

266
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:45,150
<i>girl, my best bet was
to watch a movie.</i>

267
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,248
- That's the one you like?
- Oh, it's so great.

268
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,165
- I love these two. And you?
- Yeah. They're great.

269
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,961
<i>But now,
I don't really see the point.</i>

270
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,090
<i>I don't know,
I guess I'm missing something.</i>

271
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,847
<i>Because most people eat that shit up.</i>

272
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,210
<i>The pretty woman.</i>

273
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,241
<i>The pretty man.</i>

274
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,445
<i>Love at first sight.</i>

275
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,886
<i>The first kiss.</i>

276
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,644
- <i>The breakup.</i>
<i>- I felt that!</i>

277
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,802
<i>- The makeup.
- I'm scared.</i>

278
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,601
<i>The expensive wedding,
and they drive off into the sunset.</i>

279
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,765
<i>Everyone knows it's fake, but they
watch it like it's real fucking life.</i>

280
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,523
She was the most important thing to him.
He gave up everything for her.

281
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,160
It was just meant to be.

282
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,369
- I love movies like that.
- Yeah, it was great.

283
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,809
He's just such a real man.
And she's so beautiful too, always.

284
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,480
- Her? No, she's too skinny.
- Yeah.

285
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,450
- What?
- You wanna know who's beautiful?

286
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,810
- What makes you think you could do that?
- Do what?

287
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,486
<i>In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit, Amen.</i>

288
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,246
<i>- Amen. Bless you, my son.
- Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>

289
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,363
<i>It has been one week
since my last confession.</i>

290
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,490
<i>- Tell me your sins.
- Since last Sunday I did not have</i>

291
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,927
sexual relations out of wedlock.

292
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,682
I did kiss a girl, this one girl,
out of wedlock, several times,

293
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:18,051
but it's just kissing. I don't know,
I forget if that counts, so...

294
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,329
Also, I watched pornographic videos
and masturbated <i>22</i> times.

295
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,801
For these and all the sins
of my life, I am sorry.

296
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,406
- Ten Lord's Prayers and ten Hail Marys.
- Thank you, Father.

297
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,131
<i>Through the ministry of the Church,
may God give you pardon and peace,</i>

298
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,931
and I absolve you from your sins
in the name of the Father, of the Son

299
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,969
- and the Holy Spirit.
- Amen.

300
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,682
<i>Introducing the
charbroiled, not fried, codfish sandwich,</i>

301
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,008
<i>only at Carl's Jr. and Hardee's.</i>

302
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,445
<i>More than just a piece of meat.</i>

303
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,490
Oh, go! Jesus.
It's a yellow light! Fuck you!

304
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,403
Our Father...
Who art in heaven...

305
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,291
...hallowed be Thy name...
Thy Kingdom come...

306
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,044
...Thy will be done...

307
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,361
...on earth...

308
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,081
as it is in heaven...

309
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,364
- No.
- No... What?

310
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,608
- Not out here.
- So let's go inside.

311
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,761
Mm-mm.

312
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,048
- Why not?
- It's not time for that yet.

313
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,931
- You sure?
- Yeah. We barely know each other.

314
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,041
Yeah, we do, pretty much.

315
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,210
- I don't know your friends.
- My friends?

316
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,010
Mmm...

317
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,249
- I wanna meet your friends.
- Those guys are assholes.

318
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,890
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

319
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,481
And you don't know my friends.

320
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,370
- Or our families.
- Wait, our families?

321
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,127
Yeah. I wanna meet your parents
and your sister.

322
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,681
- Oh, Jesus!
- What? You don't wanna meet my brothers

323
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,890
- and my sister?
- Uh...

324
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,921
- 'Cause I know they wanna meet you.
- Yeah... I bet they do.

325
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,048
Mmm...

326
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,444
Mm-hm.

327
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,601
- Jon.
- Yeah?

328
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,526
- I can't let you come inside just yet.
- No?

329
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,127
No, 'cause I don't know what
that would mean. You know?

330
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,363
I don't want to do anything
unless it means something.

331
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,521
Uh-huh...

332
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,480
Mm... Don't you think it's always better
when it means something?

333
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,404
- Yeah.
- Mm...

334
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,537
I think you should go
back to school, baby.

335
00:24:12,563 --> 00:24:13,306
What?

336
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,889
- Yeah, come on. Just a night class.
- Oh, my God!

337
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,168
- Just get your degree.
- Oh!

338
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,324
- You would be so sexy with a real job.
- Mm!

339
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,444
Mm-hm! Yeah...

340
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,286
So, what do you say? You, me and
our friends, we go out sometime?

341
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,762
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah? And our families meet, huh?

342
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,921
- Oh!
- Yeah?

343
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,525
- Yeah.
- Mm...

344
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,729
And you take one night class for me, baby?
One little class?

345
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,928
- Oh! Oh!
- Huh? Yeah? Yeah?

346
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,522
- Yeah! Oh!
- Come on, baby, cum... cum...

347
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,844
Mm-hm! Uh-huh.

348
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,166
- Nice.
- Oh, Jesus...

349
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,970
Yeah.

350
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,761
You're so cute.

351
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,884
Call me.

352
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,047
- Baby!
- Baby, what?

353
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,565
- Baby.
- Baby...

354
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,961
- You guys having a good time?
- You bitch, I don't wanna hear it.

355
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,202
- Jesus Christ.
- A toast. Let's make a toast.

356
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,250
Everyone listen up. You get up too.
This is for you. Come on. Get up.

357
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,561
- Oh, God.
- All right.

358
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,169
You guys know tonight is me and
this girl's one-month anniversary.

359
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,130
I'm counting that from the first time
I ever saw her, 'cause ever since then,

360
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,330
I've felt the same way. She's the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life.

361
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,403
- To you, baby.
- No, to us.

362
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,005
To us.

363
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,640
- Mwah. Cheers.
- Cheers!

364
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,450
God bless.

365
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,001
- So, what's he do?
- He's in school.

366
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,401
- Oh, the family's got money?
- No, he's got a job.

367
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,607
- Retail?
- No.

368
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,761
- Service?
- Yeah.

369
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,888
He's definitely been
spending time at the gym.

370
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,442
- Right? I know. He is so disciplined.
- You guys work out together?

371
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,604
- Mm-mm. No.
- Does he do that muscle guy thing

372
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,684
where he's, like, looking at himself
while you're doing it?

373
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,128
- Oh. We haven't done it yet.
- Shit, really?

374
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,285
- Oh, my God. That's so amazing!
- All right. I like him.

375
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,647
Goddamn! White shorts.

376
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,007
- Nah.
- What? Come on, that's a dime!

377
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,686
- That's not a dime.
- I'm sorry, but I'd rather do that

378
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,320
- than do yours.
- You faggot motherfucker!

379
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,529
- I can like any girl I wanna like.
- But she's not hotter than my girl.

380
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,570
- To you, maybe not, but to me...
- Look at that. Sorry, buddy.

381
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,963
- Fuck you, Jonny!
- That's the way...

382
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,645
Hi.

383
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,441
Shit!

384
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,364
So, uh...

385
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,726
I'm sort of seeing this girl.

386
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,167
- What did you say?
- What do you mean, what did I say?

387
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,845
- Did you say...?
- She asked you what you said.

388
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,968
What's the matter with that?
I couldn't understand you, either.

389
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,804
Speak up and talk like a human being.

390
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,405
- Shush.
- What's your problem?

391
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,921
- Jon. Did you say you found her?
- What?

392
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,607
- Well, I said I'm sort of...
- Oh, my God! What's her name?

393
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,730
- Barbara.
- Barbara! Barbara what?

394
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,042
- Here we go...
- Shh! Barbara what?

395
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,244
- Barbara Sugarman.
- Sugarman?

396
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,482
- She a Jew?
- I don't think so.

397
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,768
- You don't know?
- We haven't really talked...

398
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,729
She's not Italian, we know that.

399
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,803
- Sugarman. She black?
- No.

400
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,490
What does she look like?

401
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,881
She's the most beautiful thing
I've seen in my life.

402
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,884
- Oh, boy.
- Baby! Oh!

403
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,247
That's the sweetest thing
I ever heard anybody say.

404
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,609
- And does she love you?
- Wait a minute. Love him? You kidding?

405
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,922
- Jon, shush!
- They're kids, for Christ's sake!

406
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,526
- So what?
- You know what? Don't call me a kid.

407
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,170
We talked about this,
I don't appreciate it.

408
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,641
- Excuse me.
- Dad, I'm asking you nicely.

409
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,723
To not call you a kid?
You're a fucking kid.

410
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,211
- Jon!
- Fuck You!

411
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,200
- Fuck me? Did you just say fuck me to me?
- Jon!

412
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,523
He said they're in love, they're in love.
It doesn't matter how old they are.

413
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,604
He's older than you were
when we got married.

414
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,553
You know that?
For God's sake, he's your son!

415
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,851
You love this girl?

416
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,610
Yes, I do.

417
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,246
Then when do we get to meet her?

418
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,210
Oh!

419
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,771
All right, Mom, OK.

420
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,844
oh!

421
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,688
Bella?
Sweetheart, come over here.

422
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,161
Come on, let me fix your lipstick.
Here we go.

423
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,925
- You look so beautiful.
- Thank you.

424
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,129
- Can I get you a refill, Mrs. Sugarman?
- You don't have to do that.

425
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,884
- No, it's my pleasure.
- Jon.

426
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,128
- Thank you.
- Jon, you meet Daryl?

427
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,328
- Oh, wow.
- You wanna hold him?

428
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,529
- I don't know...
- Come here.

429
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,206
- Here you go, babe.
- OK.

430
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,445
- All right. Is that good? Is that right?
- Yeah.

431
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,568
You look so cute, the two of you.

432
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,165
Barbara!

433
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,130
- How long have we been up here for?
- Not long.

434
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,002
Well, I gotta go, we gotta go.
Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on.

435
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,684
Close the door.

436
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:13,241
OK. Let's take a break and when we get
back we'll go over the course syllabus.

437
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,121
<i>- Hey.
- Baby! How is it?</i>

438
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,328
- It's great.
- <i>Yeah? You're on break?</i>

439
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,729
<i>- Yeah. How did you know?
- Your schedule's online.</i>

440
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,850
<i>- Baby, I'm just so proud of you.
- Thanks.</i>

441
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,365
- <i>Baby?</i>
- Yeah?

442
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,966
<i>Can I come over when you're done?</i>

443
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,122
- You wanna come to my place?
- <i>Mm-hm.</i>

444
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,288
- What, tonight?
- Yeah.

445
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,010
OK, great.

446
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,568
- <i>You get back to class, sexy man.</i>
- All right.

447
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,291
<i>- Bye, baby.
- OK, bye.</i>

448
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,125
Jesus fucking Christ!

449
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,771
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.

450
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,649
It's fine. It's fine.

451
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,522
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

452
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,844
- It's OK. I'll be right back.
- Baby...

453
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,167
<i>I'm in love with Barbara. I am.</i>

454
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,687
<i>And tonight, I finally
got to fuck her.</i>

455
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,249
<i>But I'm sorry to say,
it's still not as good as porn.</i>

456
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,640
<i>Tits?</i>

457
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,928
<i>Best ever.</i>

458
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,411
<i>Ass?</i>

459
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,528
<i>Best ever.</i>

460
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,045
Blow-job?

461
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,441
<i>Shit. Good luck. A girl that hot?
She doesn't have to give head.</i>

462
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,204
<i>For her, she just wants to go from
kissing, to naked kissing, to fucking.</i>

463
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,842
<i>Or, you know, making love.</i>

464
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,685
<i>And when I say
"making love," I mean...</i>

465
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,201
<i>...missionary fucking.</i>

466
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,931
<i>No doggie.
No cowboy.</i>

467
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,203
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Baby!

468
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,567
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I was reading e-mails.

469
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,291
- You weren't. You were watching porno!
- That's not what that was.

470
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,720
- I saw you!
- But, baby...

471
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,928
Don't call me that. Oh, my God!
That's the most disgusting thing

472
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,606
- I've ever seen in my life!
- Wait, don't go right now, please!

473
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,683
I don't even know what that is.
That's sick...

474
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,207
- But, baby, I'm telling you...
- Don't call me that!

475
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,045
But I'm telling you, that thing
I was watching was just a joke!

476
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,767
Some dumb-ass buddy of mine sent it
to me as a joke. Come on!

477
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,208
You think I'm the kind of guy
that watches porn?

478
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,170
No, you didn't seem like that type.

479
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,324
Right. 'Cause fucking losers watch porn,
guys that can't get laid.

480
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,927
Well, no. My friends' boyfriends are
watching porno on the Internet all the time,

481
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,242
- it's fucking disgusting.
- It's stupid is what that is.

482
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,643
Why would they watch porn
when they can get with a real girl?

483
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,929
- So you don't do that normally?
- No.

484
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,128
When was the last time you did that
before this?

485
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,284
I don't even know.
When I was a kid or something.

486
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,369
You're never gonna do it again?

487
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,320
No. Why would I?

488
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,006
- Promise?
- I promise.

489
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,043
Baby...

490
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,600
I love you.

491
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,168
Come here.

492
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,527
<i>It's not that I can't stop.
I just figure, why should I?</i>

493
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,127
<i>I mean, my girlfriend doesn't like it.
So she doesn't have to know about it.</i>

494
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,126
<i>It's not like I'm cheating on her.
I don't do it when she's around.</i>

495
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,171
<i>And everything's fine.</i>

496
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,881
<i>She has been spending a lot of time</i>
<i>at my place, though. So I looked into it.</i>

497
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,284
<i>And it's pretty amazing how easy it is
to get porn on-the-go these days.</i>

498
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,922
<i>So...</i>

499
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,280
Excuse me?
Sorry, were you on your phone?

500
00:35:59,306 --> 00:36:00,065
No.

501
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,362
- I'm Esther.
- Good to meet you.

502
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,522
- What's your name?
- Jon.

503
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,643
- I hope I'm not bothering you.
- No, it's fine.

504
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,326
I just wanted to apologize.
I don't know if you remember,

505
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,649
you caught me in a kind
of an inopportune moment last week.

506
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,441
- When I was sobbing by the door?
- Oh! Yeah, sorry, I'm sorry about that.

507
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,002
Please, don't. Please, don't you apologize.
You didn't do anything wrong.

508
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,004
- I felt like I should say something.
- OK. Well...

509
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,886
Because I've been thinking about it,
a lot actually, and I realized that,

510
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,801
you know, nobody's seen me
like that in, like, six months,

511
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,731
- and it's not like it's a rare...
- Good evening, everyone.

512
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,606
...a rare occurrence,
I mean, I do that all the time,

513
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,243
I'm crying all the time. It's just
something that I do in private now.

514
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,370
On the one hand,
you go there when you go there.

515
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,490
On the other hand, it's really fucked up
to keep it hidden, right?

516
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,411
That's what became clear to me
when you startled me.

517
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,206
You didn't, you didn't mean
to startle me, you walked by,

518
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,762
but I just...
so I wanted to say thank you.

519
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,527
Were you... I'm sorry,
this might be rude,

520
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,489
but were you watching
people fucking on your phone?

521
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,530
- What? No!
- It's OK if you were. I'm not judging you.

522
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,684
- Lady, I'm just here to take this class.
- Did you just call me "lady"?

523
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,525
So you take care.

524
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,569
Oh, yeah. Sorry. Say no more.

525
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,446
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

526
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,010
What, are you fucking kidding me?!
You're fucking kidding me, right?!

527
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,764
- Baby!
- What?

528
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,930
I feel like I should leave my jacket
in the car. Maybe not. Should I bring it?

529
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,481
- Yeah, whatever you want.
- Oh...

530
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,961
- I'm nervous. That's all.
- Why you nervous?

531
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,531
- I don't know...
- You got nothing to be nervous about.

532
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,570
You look beautiful.
God, you look beautiful.

533
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,161
Oh.

534
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,209
- Are you ready? Go ahead.
- Yeah. All right.

535
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,405
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

536
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,161
Oh, hello, hello!
You must be Barbara.

537
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,848
- Hi, Mrs. Martello. Here, for you.
- Thank you, and please call me Angie.

538
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,689
Come in, come in. Jon! Jonny's here!
Come say hello to your son!

539
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,730
- Please.
- Let me get by you there, babe.

540
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,568
Dad? I would like you to meet Barbara.
Baby, this is my dad.

541
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,485
- Hi, Mr. Martello.
- Hey, good to meet you.

542
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,246
- Jesus Christ!
- Jon!

543
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,688
Oh, I... I wasn't expecting such
a lovely lady, that's all.

544
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,690
Thank you. It's so nice
to finally meet you both.

545
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,888
My pleasure, my pleasure.

546
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,362
Well, please sit down
and I will be right back.

547
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,201
- Can I help you with anything at all?
- Oh! I love her already.

548
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,967
- Yes, please, sweetie, come on.
- You want me to take that, babe?

549
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,126
- Hey, hey, Jonny-boy!
- She's cute, right?

550
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,322
Are you fucking kidding me?
You didn't tell me you were bringing home

551
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,723
- a piece of ass like that!
- I told you she was the most beautiful thing

552
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,690
- I've ever seen in my life.
- Yeah, you told me, but I mean,

553
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,683
Jesus Christ, those tits!
They're real?

554
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,447
- Yeah, they're real.
- Oh! Fuck me!

555
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,241
- Did you clear the table?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here, here, honey.

556
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,483
Let me move this here,
so you can put that right there.

557
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,962
- Right here?
- Right there. That's perfect.

558
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,883
So tell me.
Tell me, how did it go?

559
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,884
I was out with some girlfriends.
We went to see some band.

560
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,008
Back then you used to see bands
when you went out.

561
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,642
- Honey, what band was it?
- You think I remember?

562
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,849
It was 28 years ago,
and I didn't even give a shit then.

563
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,082
Anyway, I saw him early in the night,

564
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,250
I don't know if he saw me till later,
but I saw him.

565
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,131
And I saw her, you couldn't miss her.

566
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,284
- She was like you.
- Thank you.

567
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,761
- You know what I said?
- Listen to this.

568
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,602
I said right then,
right when I saw her, I said...

569
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,370
..."That's mine."

570
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,241
- Oh, God.
- Yup. And he was right.

571
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,129
Can you... Well, that's beautiful.

572
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,523
- Oh! Big play! Look at that!
- OK, Jon.

573
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,887
- All right, Dad.
- All right, yeah.

574
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,647
- Good job, big guy.
- Sweetie, so nice to meet you.

575
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,361
- Bye, Mr. Martello.
- Please call me Jon.

576
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,965
OK, Mom.

577
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,251
- All right, babe?
- Oh! Bye.

578
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,401
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

579
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,881
- Bye-bye.
- Drive safe.

580
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,607
- I love her! I love her!
- Pretty good, huh? Not bad at all.

581
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,571
<i>In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit, Amen.</i>

582
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,371
<i>- Amen. Bless you, my son.
- Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>

583
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,210
<i>It has been one week
since my last confession.</i>

584
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,401
<i>Tell me your sins.</i>

585
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:12,088
Since last Sunday, I had sexual
intercourse out of wedlock seven times.

586
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,762
But... I stopped watching porn.

587
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,925
Yeah, no more of that,
just the intercourse now.

588
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,690
So...

589
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,969
For these and all the sins
of my life, I am sorry.

590
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,010
- Five Lord's Prayers and five Hail Marys.
- Thank you, Father.

591
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,891
<i>Through the ministry of the Church,
may God give you pardon and peace,</i>

592
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,611
and I absolve you from your sins
in the name of the Father, of the Son

593
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,848
- and the Holy Spirit.
- Amen.

594
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,563
Very good. OK, when we come back,
we'll go over employee personality testing.

595
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,802
Go ahead, take a break.

596
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,209
- Hi. Mind if I sit down?
- You know, actually, I...

597
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,004
- I brought you something.
- You what?

598
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,491
- What's that?
- Open it.

599
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,802
- I don't want to take that from you.
- No, no, open it.

600
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,281
It's something silly.
It's a little thing. Go ahead.

601
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,124
All right. I'll open it.

602
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,401
- What the fuck is this?
- It's actually pretty good.

603
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,562
- What is the matter with you?
- Have you seen it?

604
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,802
- Are you crazy?
- It was made by this Danish woman

605
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,801
in the '70s. It's probably not what you're
used to looking at, but it's pretty hot.

606
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,328
OK. Look, I have a girlfriend, all right?
So...

607
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,610
I'm sorry, did you think I was
hitting on you? Because I'm not.

608
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,886
Will you just take this?

609
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,850
I didn't mean for it to be a big thing.
I thought you could use something better

610
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,002
than that shit you're
watching on your phone.

611
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,891
Am I right?

612
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,010
If you have a girlfriend,
why are you watching dirty movies?

613
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,640
- What?
- I'm just asking.

614
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,644
- You're fucking weird, you know that?
- I don't entirely disagree,

615
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,450
but you're the one who's gonna
pretend you're texting

616
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,807
while you watch people pretend
they're fucking on your phone!

617
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,803
The shit I watch on here,
they're not pretending.

618
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,406
Of course they are.

619
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,247
Forgive us our trespasses...

620
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,961
...as we forgive those...
who trespass against us...

621
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:06,967
...and lead us not...
into temptation...

622
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,565
...but deliver us from evil...

623
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,290
- Baby?
- Huh?

624
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,687
What are you doing?
You talking to yourself?

625
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,840
- Yo, Jonny, you coming out tonight?
- That's dubious.

626
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,128
I'm gonna wait for Barbara to call.
We're gonna meet up for dinner.

627
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,721
- This fucking guy. Come on!
- What did you think he was gonna say?

628
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,531
I thought he still had a pair
of balls hanging between his legs.

629
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,604
You sound so fucking stupid to me
right now, I feel sorry for you.

630
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,524
- Fuck you.
- I do. I feel sorry for you.

631
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,251
You never been in love, so you don't
know what you're talking about.

632
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,448
Hold up. Wait a minute.
In love?

633
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,046
When you really love a girl,
there's a lot that goes into it.

634
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,043
- You're saying you love her?
- Of course I love her.

635
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,010
- I never heard you say you loved her.
- You weren't paying attention.

636
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,050
I've been in love with this girl
since the first time I saw her.

637
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,168
Why would I wanna go out
and try to pull randoms?

638
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,288
None of 'em are gonna
look as good as my girl,

639
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,169
none of 'em are gonna fuck me
as good as my girl.

640
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,049
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

641
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,441
- So she's good?
- What did I say? Yeah, she's good.

642
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,489
- She's the best.
- So you titty-fuck her?

643
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,928
Bro, she lets me do
whatever the fuck I want.

644
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,731
This is what I'm trying to tell you,
if you would listen to me.

645
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,680
I'm telling you guys something.
You be a man, you do the right thing,

646
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,889
you find the right girl
and you treat her the right way?

647
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,323
Watch what happens.
Best sex of your life.

648
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,481
Hey, baby.

649
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,404
- Hey.
- Hi.

650
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,922
- I love it when you wear this shit.
- Oh, you're crazy.

651
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,089
- You good?
- Yeah. You order anything yet?

652
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,641
- No, I waited for you.
- Sweet.

653
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,088
- Oh, fuck!
- Who's that?

654
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,722
It's Linda.
She's been fighting with Chris.

655
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,882
I don't think they're gonna work out.

656
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,964
- You remember Linda and Chris, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

657
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,727
- I thought they were cute together, no?
- Sure. They seemed pretty good.

658
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,327
She's 28 years old. She put like four
years into the guy already. It's terrible.

659
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,049
- How did you get off work tonight?
- I got Stevie to cover my shift.

660
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,567
- Stevie?
- Yeah, he needed the hours.

661
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,008
- I don't think I know Stevie, no?
- No, I don't think you ever met him.

662
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,881
- Oh! I wish somebody would cover for me.
- See? What did I tell you?

663
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,042
The service industry,
it's not a bad thing.

664
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,089
Come on, you're gonna look so good
in a suit.

665
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,447
- I don't know.
- What? Please.

666
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,290
If Armando can do it,
that man is such an asshole.

667
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:19,091
He treats women like they're trash,
but... he makes six figures.

668
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,767
Well, he's got a pretty great life, no?
if he could do it, you could do it.

669
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:28,847
Hey, baby. You're a winner, right?
You respect people.

670
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,325
You listen to people.

671
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,484
- You think so?
- I know so, mister.

672
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,445
Fucking 'caused it! Fuck!

673
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,206
Hi, babe.

674
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,682
I don't know which ones to get.
Baby, what do you think?

675
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,764
That depends.
You gonna drill into your wall?

676
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,524
I don't know.

677
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,445
- You don't have a drill, do you?
- No.

678
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,570
Nah, I didn't think so.
My dad has got a pretty good one.

679
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,087
If you want me,
I can borrow his, I'll do it for you.

680
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,086
- You gonna drill into my wall for me?
- Whatever you want, babe.

681
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,690
You decide what color.
I'm gonna meet you at the registers.

682
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,968
I wanna pick up a few things
in cleaning products.

683
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,121
Where are you going?

684
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,850
- What?
- Where are you going?

685
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,002
I'm almost out of Swiffer pads.
I'm gonna pick a few up.

686
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,685
- What pads?
- For the Swiffer.

687
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,446
- I don't know what that is.
- You don't know the Swiffer?

688
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,443
- What is that? No.
- Seriously? It's the best.

689
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,489
You gotta try it.
What do you do for your floors?

690
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,007
You got those nice floors at your place.
What, do you mop?

691
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,249
- No.
- What do you do?

692
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,086
- I don't know. I sweep it up with a broom.
- No, I mean to really clean it.

693
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,687
- I don't know. The housekeeper does it.
- Oh, right.

694
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,326
- Listen, I'll just be a second, OK?
- No, no, no. Come here.

695
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,563
- What?
- You're not gonna go buy a mop right now.

696
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,127
- It's embarrassing.
- No, I told you, it's not a mop.

697
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,645
- It's these pads.
- I don't care.

698
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,689
You shouldn't be doing
your own housework.

699
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,649
- Why not?
- 'Cause you're a grown man.

700
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,168
- You shouldn't be cleaning your own floors.
- Why? I enjoy doing it.

701
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,607
You know what? I'll call Rosa.
She'll do your place.

702
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,127
- Who?
- Rosa, my cleaning lady, she's great.

703
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,851
Babe, no.
Thanks, but I like doing it myself.

704
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,162
Are you kidding me?
You don't got to be doing that.

705
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,330
She won't do it right anyway.
You gotta vacuum my carpet a certain way,

706
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,642
- or else it looks...
- Don't talk about vacuuming in front of me.

707
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,485
- Why? What's wrong?
- Why? Because it's not sexy, that's why.

708
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,688
You're not listening to me.
I like my place, OK?

709
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,285
I'm proud of it,
I like to take care of it.

710
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,011
I don't care. We're not having
this discussion right now.

711
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,844
There's only a few things
I really care about...

712
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,401
We're not talking about this anymore.

713
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,481
- Fine, let's drop it.
- Good.

714
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,209
Those ones.

715
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,889
- You want those?
- Yeah.

716
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,002
Come here. Listen to me.

717
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,562
When we're living together,
you're not...

718
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,690
...going to be doing... any cleaning.

719
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,490
Come on.

720
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,127
Jon? Excuse me.

721
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,450
Look, I know you don't
wanna talk to me.

722
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,529
I would leave you alone,
but I swear to God,

723
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,722
I just fell asleep during
that entire class.

724
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,202
The whole fucking thing.
Can I copy your notes?

725
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,364
I'd ask somebody else, but everyone
in the class are like children.

726
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,684
I'm not calling you old.
It'll take like five minutes...

727
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,888
- Do you mind?
- Fine.

728
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,765
Thank you so much. Do you wanna
go somewhere? There's a cafe...

729
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,400
My girlfriend's waiting
at home, so...

730
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,450
Oh. OK, well, then I'll...
OK, I'll do this.

731
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,850
I really shouldn't get so high after
lunch if I'm gonna be coming here later.

732
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,007
You're probably right.

733
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,209
It is pretty boring,
don't you think?

734
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,805
What?

735
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,929
I said this class is
pretty fucking boring.

736
00:50:07,955 --> 00:50:08,831
Oh. Yep.

737
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,167
Like they're teaching
you to be a robot.

738
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,849
- Why are you here?
-Hm?

739
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,368
- Why did you pick this class?
- I didn't.

740
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,568
What?

741
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:27,247
No, it seemed like a good idea.
I'm in the service industry now.

742
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,687
- You mean you're a waiter?
- No.

743
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,247
- Bartender?
- Yeah, so, if you wanna move up,

744
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,050
- you gotta go to school.
- Right.

745
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:39,570
But what do you mean you
didn't pick this class?

746
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,650
- No, I did.
- Did somebody pick it for you?

747
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,201
- No!
- Was it your parents or your girlfriend?

748
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,010
- What is it with you? Huh?
- No, I just...

749
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,322
- I was wondering...
- I'm doing something polite...

750
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,807
That's mine.

751
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,361
OK. Sorry.

752
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,811
Jesus!

753
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,204
Oh, man! Oh, God!

754
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,841
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, Jon.

755
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,923
What's wrong?

756
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,441
Remember when we first
started dating?

757
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,446
What's the one thing I asked?
I said, "Don't lie to me."

758
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,122
- All right, who's talking shit about me?
- Nobody said anything.

759
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,763
- You gotta help me out...
- You looked at 46 porno sites today, Jon.

760
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,082
- Just today.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

761
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,766
- Don't fucking lie to me!
- I don't know who told you that!

762
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,287
Nobody said anything.
It's right there in your history!

763
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,808
All you do is look at porno.
That's all you fucking do!

764
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:48,249
- Wait, wait. My what?
- It's in your history.

765
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,641
In your browser?

766
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,406
Come on, don't tell me you don't
know what your history is.

767
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,404
No. Of course you don't, 'cause if
you did, you would have erased it,

768
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,971
like a good little phony. Here.

769
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:02,523
There. Go ahead, look. Go ahead.

770
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,291
- Baby, I...
- Please, no, don't call me that.

771
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,165
- I love you.
- Don't ever say that to me, ever again.

772
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,766
- What do you want me to say?
- What do I want you to say?

773
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,561
How about, "I'm sorry I've been
lying to you since the first day

774
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,051
that we started dating"?
How about that?

775
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,722
- I'm sorry. I am.
- How about, "I'm sorry I have more sex

776
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,484
with that thing
than I do with my girlfriend"?

777
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,042
First of all, everybody
watches porn, OK? All guys.

778
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,248
Any guy tells you he doesn't
is lying to you.

779
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,050
- You are so full of shit!
- Second of all...

780
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,647
- You are full of shit!
- Second of all, you know damn well

781
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,922
- we do it all the fucking time!
- Yeah, I know we do.

782
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,447
- Whenever you want!
- So what the fuck is wrong with you?

783
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,080
What the fuck are you doing?
How do you watch that shit?

784
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,368
I don't know! OK?
I don't know!

785
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,291
How do you watch all the stupid
fucking movies you watch?

786
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,044
How do I watch movies?
What are you talking about?

787
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,806
I'm saying, you probably watch
that shit as much as I watch porn.

788
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,644
What are you saying?
That has nothing to do with anything!

789
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,566
- I'm just saying...
- Jon, movies and porno are different!

790
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,405
- They give awards for movies!
- They give awards for porn too.

791
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,801
Shut up!
Shut the fuck up!

792
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,048
I can't believe we're
talking about this.

793
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,202
I'm sorry. Jesus.
Look, stop it.

794
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,045
I don't know,
I don't know what's wrong with me.

795
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,645
I'm sorry, OK? I... I'm sorry.
I am so sorry...

796
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,526
I really liked you, you know?

797
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:49,123
I thought you were different.

798
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,044
But you're not.

799
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,208
<i>So up until now,
my record was ten in one day.</i>

800
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:21,365
<i>And for a long time, I thought I'd
never beat that. But today...</i>

801
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,330
<i>- ...I hit 11.</i>

802
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,882
<i>And you know, when I have great
fucking days like this,</i>

803
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:34,568
<i>it just reminds me how much
I love being single.</i>

804
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,371
<i>- I do what I want, when I want.</i>

805
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,761
<i>I don't have to flake
on my friends anymore.</i>

806
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,971
<i>I don't have to waste my time
in a fucking classroom.</i>

807
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:48,125
<i>It just feels good, like...
like I got my own life back.</i>

808
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:54,329
<i>I mean, you think I could have hit 11 when</i>
<i>I was with Barbara? No! Definitely not.</i>

809
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,921
<i>So...</i>

810
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,722
- Jonny-boy!
- Jesus, bro, I can smell it on you already.

811
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,446
- You got to catch up, baby!
- You mean I got to buy your poor ass

812
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,285
- a fucking drink?
- Yo, the Don mad anxious tonight.

813
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,010
- Fuck you!
- Where's wife?

814
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,766
- Fuck that bitch.
- Oh, shit!

815
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,331
- Damn, OK!
- All right.

816
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:35,769
You can't have this one, 'cause I
saw her first, but check out pink.

817
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,810
Yeah. She's all right.

818
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,686
- Hey, fuck you, buddy!
- Fuck you!

819
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:04,323
What'd you say? Huh?
What the fuck did you just say?! Hey!

820
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,211
You wanna say some shit? Let's hear it,
you fat fuck! What did you say?!

821
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:12,082
- I said fuck you!
- Fuck me, huh? Fuck me?

822
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,370
Is that what you said?!
Huh? Huh? You fuck! Ah!

823
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,007
Fuck! Goddamn it! Fuck!

824
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,687
<i>In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i>

825
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,571
<i>- Amen. Bless you, my son.
- Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>

826
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,165
<i>It has been one week
since my last confession.</i>

827
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,243
- Jonny, where were you?
- Don't worry about it.

828
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,731
- What did you do to your...?
- Mom, it's fine.

829
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,730
- Shh!
- Hey, hush yourself!

830
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,366
Mom! It's fine.
OK?

831
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,760
<i>Tell me your sins.</i>

832
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,606
Father, I don't know
what happened, but...

833
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,570
...I guess I lost my temper and I...

834
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,644
I punched through this guy's window
on my way here right now.

835
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,928
I didn't hurt anybody, but...

836
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,531
Yeah, I don't know
what's wrong with me.

837
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:14,047
Also, I watched pornographic videos
and masturbated 35 times.

838
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,608
For these and all the sins
of my life, I'm sorry.

839
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,287
- Twenty Lord's Prayers and 25 Hail Marys.
- Thank you, Father.

840
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,410
<i>Through the ministry of the Church,
may God give you pardon and peace.</i>

841
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:28,007
<i>I absolve you from your sins in the name of
the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.</i>

842
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,525
Amen.

843
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,969
- So Barbara couldn't come tonight?
- No, she had this family thing tonight.

844
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,202
But she wanted to make it,
she just couldn't.

845
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,364
- She told me to say hello to you guys.
- That's sweet.

846
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,210
Everything good with
the two of you?

847
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:46,849
- Yeah, she's great.
- She's a catch, Jonny.

848
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,606
Beautiful girl.

849
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,924
I'm telling you,
a woman like that make a boy into a man.

850
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,321
I can see it on you too,
it's starting.

851
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,162
Holy Mary...

852
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,685
...Mother of God...

853
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,123
...pray for us sinners...

854
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,685
...now...

855
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,804
...and at the hour of our death.

856
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,770
Amen.

857
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,604
What the fuck?

858
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,207
- The fuck you doing here?
- Damn, really?

859
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,931
- Bro, I'm busy.
- Word, what you doing?

860
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:08,000
Right. Just 'cause you don't pick up
your phone don't make you busy.

861
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,163
- You smashed up somebody's car?
- Who told you that?

862
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:18,684
Kerry's sister said she heard you broke
through some guy's window.

863
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,888
- Well, did you?
- The guy was a fucking asshole.

864
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,485
- What did he do?
- Why you taking his side?

865
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,165
- I'm not taking his side.
- You are.

866
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,449
Stop and think for a second.
Stop and think for a second.

867
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,683
I don't care about that guy, I don't
give a damn about his car. Fuck him.

868
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,729
What do you think
I'm doing here, man?

869
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,323
- You wanna have a seat?
- Bro, honestly...

870
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,562
Man, sit your ass down.

871
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,771
- All right, what happened with your girl?
- Fuck that bitch.

872
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,287
- You said that already. What, she drop you?
- No.

873
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:52,165
No? You drop her?
After all that, she cheat on you?

874
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,970
- No!
- So, what happened?

875
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:57,567
Nothing! It's so fucking stupid.
That's what I'm saying, she's a bitch.

876
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,291
She did drop your ass.
What did you do, man? You cheat on her?

877
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,726
No!

878
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:05,646
All right, you wanna hear this shit?
It's so fucking retarded.

879
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,121
She caught me
watching porn.

880
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,487
- That's it?
- Right?

881
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,642
- That's bullshit.
- Swear to God.

882
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:17,089
Oh, my God! OK, hold on,
hold on, all right.

883
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:21,689
So after all that obligatory shit,
the friend mixing and meeting her folks,

884
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:25,049
she just walks in on you, you know,
beating your meat to a little video

885
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,804
- and she's out?
- You don't know her.

886
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,964
- She's crazy, she's a princess.
- Goddamn!

887
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,849
- I know.
- No, for real,

888
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,570
that's some crazy bullshit
right there.

889
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:37,520
- Fuck that bitch.
- Yeah. Fuck that bitch.

890
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:42,848
But you still gonna
finish that class?

891
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,968
- Really?
- What are you, my mom?

892
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,845
No, I just thought it was almost done.
How much longer you got?

893
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,005
All right, everyone,
three more weeks until the final.

894
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,484
If you have any questions or concerns, please
feel free to e-mail me. Have a good night.

895
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,651
- Hey.
- Hi.

896
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,842
- Where you going?
- To my car.

897
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,522
- Oh, shit!
- OK.

898
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,490
No, we're fine,
we're fine, we're fine.

899
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,208
Oh, my God!

900
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,890
Should've smoked this before,
you might've relaxed a little.

901
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,929
What's that supposed to mean?

902
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:54,165
I'm playing with you. Trust me,
I'm a perfectly satisfied customer.

903
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,483
- You want some?
- Thanks.

904
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,564
So I'm parked all the way on the other side.
I don't know if you want...

905
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,361
I know, you wanna get back, so let me enjoy
this and I'll drive you back to your car.

906
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,249
OK.

907
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:16,526
- So, what happened with your girlfriend?
- Fuck that bitch.

908
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:20,082
- That bad? She find somebody else?
- No.

909
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,163
Wanna know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.

910
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:27,003
She snooped around on my computer,
she found out I watch porn.

911
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,970
I told her every fucking guy watches
porn, she didn't believe me.

912
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:34,205
She acted like I was cheating on her
or something, which I wasn't.

913
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,727
So... we broke up.

914
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,326
And you know what?
I'm glad we did.

915
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,168
- Just porn?
- Yeah.

916
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,250
- No, I don't buy it.
- I'm telling you. That's all.

917
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,802
Was it just once?
Oh.

918
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:54,249
OK. So she caught you once, which is why
you're watching it on your phone at school,

919
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,051
'cause you're hiding it from her,
but she caught you the second time.

920
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,170
I don't know.
Am I right? I'm just guessing, but...

921
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,807
Oh, God, you're like a junkie.
You can't stop.

922
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,721
- How often do you watch it?
- What the fuck do you care?

923
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:14,364
- No, like every day?
- Every guy watches porn every day.

924
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:18,485
All right. When was the last time
you went a day without it?

925
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,449
- I don't know.
- No, come on, try and think.

926
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:23,171
- Seriously, I have no idea.
- Like this week, like this month?

927
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:27,160
No. I like my porn, OK?
I watch it every day. I always have.

928
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:30,921
Maybe when I was a kid, like before
I had a VCR in my room and I couldn't,

929
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:34,163
but even then I had Playboys, so...

930
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,800
- Have you ever thought about quitting?
- Quit...?

931
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,924
You're talking about it like...
No, why would I?

932
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,526
OK, let me ask you this.

933
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,843
You're a good-looking guy, I'm sure you
attract a lot of young ladies.

934
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,321
Why bother with porn
when you can have the real thing?

935
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,767
Nah, see, it's not the same thing.

936
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,924
I mean, real pussy's all good,
but, no offense...

937
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:58,847
No, no, no offense taken.
So you like porn better than sex?

938
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,768
Well, what is it?
What do you get from porn

939
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,605
that you don't get from sex
with an actual person?

940
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:12,091
- I lose myself.
- You lose yourself.

941
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:15,568
Yeah, just... goodbye.

942
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:19,247
- And that doesn't happen when you have sex.
- I wish it did.

943
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:23,450
Sure, don't we all? Um...

944
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:27,286
OK. One more question,
then I'll drive you back.

945
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:31,081
- You ever jerk off without porn?
- What do you mean?

946
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,402
<i>I'm not like a junkie.
Come on, that's stupid.</i>

947
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,291
<i>It's porn, it's not fucking heroin.</i>

948
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:05,526
<i>I knew a few guys in high school who
actually smoked crack, like all the time.</i>

949
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:10,846
<i>That's like a junkie. They couldn't stop.
I could stop if I wanted to. I could.</i>

950
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,005
- Hi.
- Hey.

951
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:12,721
- Somebody's excited.
- Yeah. Come on.

952
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,521
- I wanted to talk to you.
- Yeah? What about?

953
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,610
Don't you wanna...?

954
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,765
Don't you wanna wait
till after class?

955
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,650
OK.

956
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,331
All right.

957
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,207
You're... You're intense today.
What's going on with you?

958
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,880
- I gotta talk to you.
- I didn't think you meant that

959
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,929
- when you said it.
- Well, I did.

960
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:59,641
Well, I'm flattered.
What do you wanna talk about?

961
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,485
Um...

962
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,244
So you were right.

963
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,050
- About what, your girlfriend?
- No.

964
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,965
I'm sorry.
I was right about what?

965
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,851
- I stopped watching porn.
- Oh, yeah? That's great!

966
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,365
- I don't know if it is.
- No, it is.

967
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:17,844
I wasn't gonna stop, but then I was
thinking about what you asked me before,

968
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,927
¡f 1 ever jerk off without watching porn,
and 1 tried to...

969
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:26,721
- Yeah? And you couldn't?
- No, I couldn't.

970
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,043
I don't know what's wrong with me. I've been
trying for a week, it's really fucked up.

971
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:36,128
- Oh, my God! You haven't cum in a week?
- Mm...

972
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,971
OK, wait. No. I want to hear
the rest of the story.

973
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,328
- So you haven't watched porn in a week.
- Yeah.

974
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,209
- That's good.
- What do you mean?

975
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:50,010
You said you watched porn.

976
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,642
Uh, yeah, but that movie
that I gave you was totally...

977
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,330
- Did you ever watch it?
- No.

978
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,609
OK. It's totally unlike the stuff
that I imagine you watch every day.

979
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,246
- That is not healthy.
- What do you mean? How do you know?

980
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,449
Oh, my God, please!
That stuff is ridiculous

981
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:08,725
and it's nothing to do with actual sex.
That's why you have trouble with real women.

982
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:12,771
- No, I get off fine with real girls.
- Yeah, you definitely do.

983
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:16,083
Yeah, I just couldn't get off
beating it with my eyes closed.

984
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:21,280
But didn't you tell me last week
that you like porn better than real sex?

985
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:26,325
Well, honey, I'm gonna be honest with you,
'cause it seems like that's what you want.

986
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,927
Look, the way you have sex,
it's like totally one-sided.

987
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,771
It's like I'm not even there.

988
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:36,407
I mean, look, it's fine with me.
I'm not complaining.

989
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,166
It just so happens that meaningless sex
is something that I want in my life now,

990
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:42,847
but you said that you
wanna lose yourself in sex.

991
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,130
If you wanna lose yourself, you have
to lose yourself in another person.

992
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:51,729
And she has to lose herself in you.
It's a two-way thing.

993
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,448
You know what?
I shouldn't have said that.

994
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,887
- No, it's fine.
- No, no, no. I'm sorry. I am.

995
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:06,806
- What are you talking about?
- No. I'm really sorry.

996
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,406
I'm... I didn't mean to
hurt your feelings.

997
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:12,370
- You didn't. That's fine.
- No, I really didn't.

998
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,683
You know what?

999
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,408
Let's take a bath.

1000
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,281
- What? Nah!
- No, come on. It'll be nice.

1001
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:26,364
Come on, let's take a bath.

1002
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,482
I'm gonna get you a towel.

1003
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,007
Hey, where were you?

1004
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,447
I used one of the towels that was
in there, hope you don't mind.

1005
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,489
Yeah, that's fine.

1006
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:53,002
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1007
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:00,964
- You don't live here alone, do you?
- I actually do.

1008
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:06,843
There's some kind of...
bad marriage situation here?

1009
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,002
- No.
- I know it's none of my business, sorry.

1010
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:13,125
I don't wanna get caught out and now some
guy's coming at me with a bat or some shit.

1011
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,521
No, it's nothing like that.

1012
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,324
All right. So, what is it?

1013
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:22,211
Since when do you ask
me personal questions?

1014
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,086
Since right now.

1015
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:29,923
- It really doesn't matter.
- Well, it seems like it matters to you.

1016
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,048
No, it doesn't.

1017
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:36,649
Didn't you tell me it's sort of fucked up
to keep stuff like this hidden?

1018
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:47,687
My husband and my son
died 14 months ago.

1019
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,126
- Jesus!
- Thank you.

1020
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,845
What happened?

1021
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,970
Cars are terrible things.

1022
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,284
I'm sorry, but your hair
is so much better this way.

1023
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,011
- What?
- I can touch it.

1024
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:05,085
- What are you talking about?
- You put so much junk in your hair,

1025
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:08,210
it's all sticky and hard,
this is much better.

1026
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,929
<i>♪ Good vibration</i>

1027
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:35,687
<i>♪ It's such a sweet sensation</i>

1028
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,242
<i>♪ It's such a good vibration...</i>

1029
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,283
<i>♪ Yo! It's about that time</i>

1030
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,965
<i>♪ To bring forth the rhythm
and the rhyme...</i>

1031
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:06,041
<i>In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i>

1032
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:09,044
<i>- Amen. Bless you, my son.
- Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>

1033
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,770
<i>It has been one week
since my last confession.</i>

1034
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:14,402
<i>- Tell me your sins.</i>
- First of all, I lied to you before.

1035
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,971
I told you that, uh...

1036
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:19,090
Well, actually,
I don't know if it was you.

1037
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,841
Something I've always kinda wondered is, is
it the same guy I'm talking to every week

1038
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,688
or there's a few of you and you
switch off, or... how does that all work?

1039
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:34,411
Well, anyway,
I told the Father a while back

1040
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:40,488
that I stopped watching pornography,
but that was a lie, I didn't stop at all.

1041
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:45,163
The thing is, this week I actually did stop,
like totally just not doing it anymore.

1042
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:47,322
So...

1043
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,442
- Yes?
- Yeah, so that's like zero for the week.

1044
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,650
Other than that, I did have
sex out of wedlock one time,

1045
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:01,840
but it was different,
it wasn't just sex, it was like...

1046
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,086
I don't know, it's hard to explain,
but... yeah, that's it. So...

1047
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:11,165
For these and all the sins
of my life, I am sorry.

1048
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:15,166
- Ten Lord's Prayers and ten Hail Marys.
- Really? Same thing, no difference?

1049
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,561
<i>Through the ministry
of the Church, may God give you...</i>

1050
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,047
Wait! Father, I'm really sorry,

1051
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:23,568
but could you just tell me how
you got to those numbers, please?

1052
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:28,243
'Cause I... I really thought there
was gonna be a difference this week.

1053
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,567
Have faith, my son.

1054
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:37,291
Through the ministry of the Church,
may God give you pardon and peace,

1055
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:42,048
and I absolve you from your sins in the name
of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

1056
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:51,481
- So, uh... me and Barbara split up.
- What?

1057
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:56,567
- Barbara and I split up.
- I can't believe it, this is horrible!

1058
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:58,484
- Can you get her back?
- I don't think so.

1059
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,086
- Did you try to call her?
- She doesn't want me to call her.

1060
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,481
- Look what you did.
- Sorry. What do you want me to do?

1061
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:07,401
I just want you to be happy,
that's all! Is that too much to ask?

1062
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,605
- I wasn't happy.
- A nice wife and some nice kids?

1063
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,286
Look at me!
I look like a grandmother,

1064
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,881
but do I have any grandchildren? No!

1065
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,042
Am I a bad mother,
is that what I'm hearing?

1066
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,806
- Honey, calm down, please!
- You know, Ma, I don't know

1067
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:26,409
- if I really want a wife and kids.
- What are you saying? You don't mean that.

1068
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,324
- Jon, say something!
- All right!

1069
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,245
Stop upsetting your mother!
What the fuck is the matter with you?

1070
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,687
- I don't know.
- Having a family is the greatest joy

1071
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,764
- in a man's life, everybody knows that!
- Then maybe I'm not a man.

1072
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:41,284
'Cause I sure don't want a family.
Maybe one day, but not right now!

1073
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:44,125
- Well, and that's all she wanted.
- What did she say?

1074
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:48,490
- I said that that girl...
- I cannot hear any fucking thing!

1075
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,764
- What are you saying?
- All I'm saying is, that girl,

1076
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,922
she has her own agenda.
She doesn't care about Jonny,

1077
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,730
she doesn't know
the first thing about him.

1078
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,850
She just wants a guy who's
gonna do whatever she tells him to.

1079
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,128
It is a good thing
that she broke up with you.

1080
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:09,327
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1081
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:21,850
- Jon, I will fucking kill you!
- All right. Easy.

1082
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:10,963
All right, listen, listen, I gotta go,
so I'll see you later? All right. Bye.

1083
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:12,770
- Sorry.
- That's cool.

1084
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,571
- Sorry about that.
- No problem. How you doing?

1085
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:18,326
- A little windy.
- Yeah, it's windy out here.

1086
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:21,444
- So... I'm good. How are you?
- Good, thanks.

1087
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,046
- Everybody good?
- Yeah, great.

1088
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,366
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Sure.

1089
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,966
Hope you understand why I thought lunch
was not a good idea.

1090
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:34,687
- That's fine. You want some coffee?
- No, actually I gotta go pretty soon, so...

1091
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:43,127
- You changed your hair?
- Yeah...

1092
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,002
- So?
- Yeah, so...

1093
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:53,202
I just wanted to apologize.

1094
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:57,129
I lied to you, and
I'm sorry for that.

1095
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,446
Well, that's all you're gonna say?

1096
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:11,168
I don't really know what I do with that.
What do I say?

1097
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:14,005
I forgive you, or we're supposed
to get back together or something?

1098
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:18,205
- No. No, I just wanted to tell you...
- You're not capable of a relationship, Jon.

1099
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:22,081
- You're not.
- No. Right now I'm not.

1100
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:25,005
'Cause you're a selfish person,
and you're a liar.

1101
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:29,051
- Yeah, I was. I'm sorry.
- I asked you to do one thing for me...

1102
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:33,250
Yeah. I was thinking about that
when you said it before.

1103
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:36,847
Well, I said it because it's true,
that's why.

1104
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,846
- It's not true.
- Really?

1105
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,970
You didn't only ask me for one thing.
You asked for a lot,

1106
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:48,487
a lot of different things and then...

1107
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,885
...I couldn't do it all for you.

1108
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:55,364
Well, when a real man loves a woman,
he doesn't mind doing things for her.

1109
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,046
He'll do anything for her.

1110
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:03,331
Yeah, but don't you think that
sounds a little bit one-sided?

1111
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,881
No, I don't.

1112
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:09,601
But that's why you like to watch
those whores in those videos,

1113
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,041
because you don't gotta
do anything for them, right?

1114
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:17,081
Yeah, that's one-sided also.
Definitely.

1115
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:22,566
Look, sweetie, I'm gonna go, OK?

1116
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,728
Don't call me anymore.

1117
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,647
The streak is over, motherfucker!
How's it feel?

1118
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:42,043
- I'd rather get pizza with my boys.
- That's new.

1119
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:45,966
Every fucking time we go out,
Don Jon smashes!

1120
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:48,043
But not tonight,
ladies and gentlemen.

1121
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:51,283
The fans are devastated.
Jonny, what happened?

1122
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:53,761
Yeah! Well, I thought it was on
with old crop top.

1123
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,082
- No, that girl was annoying.
- She was tight though.

1124
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,446
- Eight.
- Solid eight.

1125
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:00,086
Her body was at least an eight,
but you didn't talk to her.

1126
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:02,766
- Who cares how she talks?
- You asked why I didn't smash,

1127
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:06,891
that's why I didn't smash. What about you?
You were kicking it to pony-tail, right?

1128
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,930
- How did it go?
- You get her name?

1129
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,924
- I got a number.
- Oh! Hey!

1130
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,003
- You like that?
- Fucking right I do!

1131
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:19,603
- Easy, easy. Did you get her name?
- Yeah!

1132
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:20,966
Wait...

1133
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:24,885
- Oh, fuck!
- What?

1134
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,525
I saved it as pony-tail.

1135
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:29,126
- Danny-boy!
- Danny-boy!

1136
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:32,648
All right, all right, all right.
Take it easy, take it easy.

1137
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:46,764
<i>This fucking lady.</i>

1138
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,970
<i>I don't usually like it when a girl
looks me right in the eye,</i>

1139
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,929
<i>and this girl does that a lot.</i>

1140
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:57,369
<i>But I don't know what it is about her.
When she does it, I don't mind.</i>

1141
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:01,844
<i>I just look right back at her,
and pretty soon...</i>

1142
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,241
<i>...I'm hard as a fucking rock.</i>

1143
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,801
<i>It's like she knows
what I'm thinking.</i>

1144
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,731
<i>Or I know what she's thinking, or...</i>

1145
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:13,845
<i>I don't know, it's that two-way thing.
I fucking love it.</i>

1146
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,885
<i>And I don't mean love like,
"I love her, I wanna marry her."</i>

1147
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:23,725
<i>I'm definitely not thinking
about all that shit.</i>

1148
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:26,281
<i>And she's not either.</i>

1149
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:29,722
<i>She can't.</i>

1150
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,330
<i>I guess I just mean love like,</i>

1151
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:40,690
<i>you know, like when
we're making love.</i>

1152
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:45,730
<i>And while we 're doing it,
all the bullshit does fade away,</i>

1153
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:48,963
<i>and it's just me and her,
right there,</i>

1154
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,602
<i>and yeah, I do lose myself in her,</i>

1155
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:56,162
<i>and I can tell she is
losing herself in me,</i>

1156
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:01,486
<i>and we 're just fucking...
lost together.</i>
