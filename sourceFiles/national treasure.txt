1
00:01:28,995 --> 00:01:30,053
Grandpa!

2
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:34,122
You're not supposed to be up here,
looking at that.

3
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:36,760
I just wanted to know.

4
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:40,404
Well, you're old enough, I suppose.

5
00:01:41,307 --> 00:01:44,071
You should know the story.

6
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:47,976
OK, here we go.

7
00:01:48,982 --> 00:01:52,042
It was 1832.

8
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,350
On a night much like this.

9
00:02:01,294 --> 00:02:02,318
Yah!

10
00:02:03,263 --> 00:02:09,566
<i>Charles Carroll was the last surviving
signer of the Declaration of Independence.</i>

11
00:02:10,336 --> 00:02:14,067
<i>He was also a member
of a secret society known as the Masons.</i>

12
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:17,609
<i>And he knew he was dying.</i>

13
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:20,869
<i>He woke up his stable boy
in the middle of the night</i>

14
00:02:20,947 --> 00:02:25,646
<i>and ordered him to take him to
the White House to see Andrew Jackson.</i>

15
00:02:25,718 --> 00:02:28,846
<i>Because it was urgent
that he speak to the president.</i>

16
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:31,414
Did he talk to him?

17
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,726
No. He never got the chance.

18
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:37,194
<i>The president wasn't there that night.</i>

19
00:02:38,665 --> 00:02:41,828
But Charles Carroll had a secret.

20
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:46,133
So he took into his confidence
the one person he could,

21
00:02:46,205 --> 00:02:49,174
my grandfather's grandfather,

22
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:51,807
<i>Thomas Gates.</i>

23
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:54,073
What was the secret?

24
00:02:56,883 --> 00:02:57,872
A treasure.

25
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:03,147
A treasure beyond all imagining.

26
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:10,389
<i>A treasure that had been
fought over for centuries</i>

27
00:03:10,463 --> 00:03:14,866
<i>by tyrants. Pharaohs.
Emperors. Warlords.</i>

28
00:03:15,168 --> 00:03:18,660
<i>And every time it changed hands
it grew larger.</i>

29
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:24,201
And then suddenly...

30
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,637
it vanished.

31
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:31,645
<i>It didn't reappear
for more than a thousand years.</i>

32
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:33,549
<i>When knights from the First Crusade</i>

33
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:37,055
<i>discovered secret vaults
beneath the Temple of Solomon.</i>

34
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:39,648
<i>You see. The knights who found the vaults</i>

35
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:44,163
<i>believed that the treasure
was too great for any one man -</i>

36
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,221
<i>not even a king.</i>

37
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:52,602
<i>They brought the treasure back to Europe
and took the name "the Knights Templar. "</i>

38
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:58,168
<i>Over the next century
they smuggled it out of Europe</i>

39
00:03:58,244 --> 00:04:01,179
<i>and they formed a new brotherhood
called the Freemasons.</i>

40
00:04:01,247 --> 00:04:04,045
<i>In honor of
the builders of the great temple.</i>

41
00:04:05,418 --> 00:04:06,908
<i>War followed.</i>

42
00:04:06,986 --> 00:04:10,945
<i>By the time of the American Revolution
the treasure had been hidden again.</i>

43
00:04:11,023 --> 00:04:13,184
<i>By then the Masons included</i>

44
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:17,389
<i>George Washington.
Benjamin Franklin. Paul Revere.</i>

45
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:20,228
<i>They knew they had to make sure</i>

46
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:23,735
<i>the treasure would never fall
into the hands of the British.</i>

47
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:27,933
So they devised a series of clues
and maps to its location.

48
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:30,840
Over time the clues were lost or forgotten,

49
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,105
until only one remained -

50
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:39,175
and that was the secret that Charles Carroll
entrusted to young Thomas Gates.

51
00:04:45,258 --> 00:04:46,282
Charlotte.

52
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,618
"The secret lies with Charlotte. "

53
00:04:51,297 --> 00:04:53,094
Who's Charlotte?

54
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,863
Oh... not even Mr. Carroll knew that.

55
00:04:56,936 --> 00:04:58,767
Now look here, Ben.

56
00:04:58,838 --> 00:05:03,275
The Freemasons
among our Founding Fathers left us clues.

57
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:04,832
Like these.

58
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:08,176
The unfinished pyramid.
The all-seeing eye.

59
00:05:08,714 --> 00:05:12,946
Symbols of the Knights Templar,
guardians of the treasure.

60
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:18,816
<i>- They're speaking to us through these.
- You mean laughing at us.</i>

61
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:21,724
You know what that dollar represents?

62
00:05:21,794 --> 00:05:24,388
The entire Gates family fortune.

63
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:28,867
Six generations of fools...
chasing after fool's gold.

64
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:32,371
<i>It's not about the money,
Patrick. It's never been about the money.</i>

65
00:05:32,438 --> 00:05:34,599
Come on, son. Time to go.

66
00:05:35,241 --> 00:05:38,005
You can... say your goodbyes.

67
00:05:45,485 --> 00:05:47,112
Grandpa?

68
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:48,847
Hm?

69
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:52,519
Are we knights?

70
00:05:55,027 --> 00:05:57,461
Do you want to be?

71
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,988
All right. Um... kneel.

72
00:06:12,645 --> 00:06:14,545
Benjamin Franklin Gates,

73
00:06:14,614 --> 00:06:20,211
you take upon yourself the duty
of the Templars, the Freemasons

74
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:23,221
and the family Gates.

75
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,015
Do you so swear?

76
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:28,083
I so swear.

77
00:06:50,716 --> 00:06:53,082
<i>I was thinking about
Henson and Peary,</i>

78
00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:57,748
crossing this kind of terrain with nothing
more than dog sleds and on foot.

79
00:06:57,823 --> 00:07:00,451
- Can you imagine?
- It's extraordinary.

80
00:07:06,532 --> 00:07:08,523
We getting closer?

81
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:12,594
Assuming Ben's theory's correct
and my tracking model's accurate,

82
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:15,402
<i>we should be getting very close.</i>

83
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:19,103
But don't go by me -
I broke a shoelace this morning.

84
00:07:22,348 --> 00:07:26,045
- It's... it's a bad omen.
- Shall we turn around and go home?

85
00:07:26,118 --> 00:07:29,246
Or we could pull over
and just throw him out here.

86
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:32,351
OK.

87
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:36,054
Riley, you're not missing that little
windowless cubicle we found you in?

88
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:38,255
No, no. Absolutely not.

89
00:07:56,382 --> 00:07:59,215
Why are we stopping?
I thought we were looking for a ship.

90
00:07:59,285 --> 00:08:03,312
- I don't see any ship.
- She's out there.

91
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,057
Look... this is a waste of time.

92
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:20,162
How could a ship wind up way out here?

93
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:23,367
Well, I'm no expert, but...

94
00:08:23,442 --> 00:08:26,570
it could be that the hydrothermic properties
of this region

95
00:08:26,646 --> 00:08:29,274
produce hurricane-force ice storms

96
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:33,409
that cause the ocean to freeze
and then melt and then refreeze,

97
00:08:33,486 --> 00:08:38,150
resulting in a semisolid
migrating land mass

98
00:08:38,224 --> 00:08:41,887
that would land a ship right around here.

99
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,707
Hello, beautiful.

100
00:09:40,953 --> 00:09:44,354
<i>Have Viktor
check the fuel in the generators.</i>

101
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:49,727
Two years ago, if you hadn't shown up,
hadn't believed the treasure was real,

102
00:09:49,795 --> 00:09:52,093
<i>I don't know
if I ever would have found Charlotte.</i>

103
00:09:52,164 --> 00:09:54,962
You would have found it, I have no doubt.

104
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:59,437
That's why I didn't think it was
as crazy an investment as everyone said.

105
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:03,970
<i>I'm just relieved that I'm not as crazy
as everyone says. Or said my dad was.</i>

106
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,608
<i>Or my granddad. Or my great-granddad.</i>

107
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:10,978
OK!

108
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,109
Let's go!

109
00:10:13,886 --> 00:10:17,879
- Let's go find some treasure.
- Yeah, bring us back something.

110
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:29,761
Urgh.

111
00:10:56,695 --> 00:10:58,925
Oh, God!

112
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:03,698
You handled that well.

113
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,170
This is it.

114
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,540
It's the cargo hold.

115
00:11:21,854 --> 00:11:24,618
Do you think it's in the barrels?

116
00:11:43,442 --> 00:11:45,069
Gunpowder.

117
00:11:46,812 --> 00:11:48,837
Ooh! Ooh! OK...

118
00:11:54,286 --> 00:11:57,722
Why would the captain
be guarding this barrel?

119
00:12:22,848 --> 00:12:24,839
I found something!

120
00:12:31,423 --> 00:12:33,414
What is it?

121
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,140
Do you guys know what this is?

122
00:12:53,612 --> 00:12:55,910
Is it a billion-dollar pipe?

123
00:12:57,683 --> 00:13:01,141
It's a meerschaum pipe.
Ah, that is beautiful.

124
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,621
Look at the intricacy of the scrollwork
on the stem.

125
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,888
- Is it a million-dollar pipe?
- No, it's a clue.

126
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:11,725
Let me see that.

127
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:14,961
No, don't break it!

128
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:17,662
We are one step closer to the treasure,
gentlemen.

129
00:13:17,736 --> 00:13:20,364
<i>Ben, I thought you said that
the treasure would be on the Charlotte.</i>

130
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:22,930
<i>No, "The secret lies with Charlotte. "</i>

131
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:25,101
<i>I said it could be here.</i>

132
00:13:41,994 --> 00:13:44,622
It's Templar symbols.

133
00:13:51,103 --> 00:13:53,128
"The legend writ. "

134
00:13:53,205 --> 00:13:55,332
"The stain effected. "

135
00:13:55,407 --> 00:13:58,501
"The key in Silence undetected. "

136
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:02,070
"Fifty-five in iron pen. "

137
00:14:03,148 --> 00:14:05,548
"Mr. Matlack can't offend. "

138
00:14:09,154 --> 00:14:11,349
It's a riddle.

139
00:14:14,493 --> 00:14:16,222
I need to think.

140
00:14:19,732 --> 00:14:21,757
"The legend writ. "

141
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,825
"The stain effected. "

142
00:14:24,703 --> 00:14:26,694
What legend?

143
00:14:27,706 --> 00:14:32,040
There's the legend of the Templar treasure,
and the stain effects the legend.

144
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:34,170
How?

145
00:14:34,246 --> 00:14:36,680
"The key in Silence undetected. "

146
00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:39,674
Wait.

147
00:14:40,586 --> 00:14:44,613
The legend and the key...
Now there's something.

148
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,157
A map.

149
00:14:46,225 --> 00:14:49,023
Maps have legends, maps have keys.

150
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:51,289
It's a map, an invisible map.
So now...

151
00:14:51,363 --> 00:14:55,060
Wait a minute. What do you mean,
"invisible" - "an invisible map"?

152
00:14:55,134 --> 00:14:59,434
"The stain effected"
could refer to a dye or a reagent

153
00:14:59,505 --> 00:15:02,065
used to bring about a certain result.

154
00:15:02,141 --> 00:15:05,008
Combined with
"The key in Silence undetected,"

155
00:15:05,077 --> 00:15:10,071
the implication is that the effect is to make
what was undetectable detectable.

156
00:15:10,816 --> 00:15:15,014
Unless...
"The key in Silence" could be...

157
00:15:15,087 --> 00:15:17,612
Prison.

158
00:15:18,424 --> 00:15:20,153
Albuquerque.

159
00:15:20,225 --> 00:15:22,819
See, I can do it too.
Snorkel.

160
00:15:22,895 --> 00:15:25,659
That's where the map is.
Like he said, "Fifty-five in iron pen. "

161
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:27,198
"Iron pen" is a prison.

162
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:32,704
Or it could be, since the primary writing
medium of the time was iron gall ink,

163
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:35,706
the "pen" is... just a pen.

164
00:15:35,774 --> 00:15:40,211
But then why not say a pen?
Why... why say "iron pen"?

165
00:15:41,046 --> 00:15:43,105
'Cause it's a prison.

166
00:15:43,182 --> 00:15:47,312
Wait a minute. "Iron pen" - the "iron"
does not describe the ink in the pen,

167
00:15:48,187 --> 00:15:51,020
<i>it describes what was penned.</i>

168
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:54,355
It was "iron" -
it was firm, it was mineral...

169
00:15:54,426 --> 00:15:56,087
No, no, no, that's stupid.

170
00:15:56,161 --> 00:16:01,622
It was... It was firm,
it was adamant, it was resolved.

171
00:16:03,402 --> 00:16:05,393
It was resolved.

172
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:08,162
"Mr. Matlack can't offend. "

173
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,903
Timothy Matlack was the official scribe
of the Continental Congress.

174
00:16:11,977 --> 00:16:16,311
Calligrapher, not writer. And to make sure
he could not offend the map,

175
00:16:16,381 --> 00:16:20,181
it was put on the back of a resolution
that he transcribed,

176
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:24,188
a resolution that 55 men signed.

177
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:29,792
The Declaration of Independence.

178
00:16:31,964 --> 00:16:33,488
Oh!

179
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:40,872
Come on, there's no invisible map on the
back of the Declaration of Independence.

180
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:43,430
That's clever, really.
A document of that importance

181
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:45,739
would ensure the map's survival.

182
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:48,609
And you said there were several Masons
signed it, yeah?

183
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,945
Yeah. Nine, for sure.

184
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:56,810
We'll have to arrange a way to examine it.

185
00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:00,120
This is one of the most important
documents in history.

186
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:04,561
They're not just gonna let us waltz in there
and run chemical tests on it.

187
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,190
- Then what do you propose we do?
- I don't know!

188
00:17:11,036 --> 00:17:13,197
We could borrow it.

189
00:17:14,173 --> 00:17:16,164
Steal it?

190
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:20,511
- I don't think so.
- Ben...

191
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:24,037
the treasure of the Knights Templar
is the treasure of all treasures.

192
00:17:24,116 --> 00:17:26,812
Oh, I didn't know that.
Really?

193
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:32,022
Look, Ben... I understand your bitterness.
I really do.

194
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:34,484
You've spent your entire life
searching for this treasure,

195
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,755
only to have
the respected historical community

196
00:17:36,828 --> 00:17:40,662
treat you and your family
with mockery and contempt.

197
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:43,257
You should be able to rub this treasure
in their arrogant faces,

198
00:17:43,335 --> 00:17:46,031
and I want you to have
the chance to do that.

199
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,563
How?

200
00:17:48,974 --> 00:17:51,738
We all have our areas of expertise.

201
00:17:52,878 --> 00:17:56,370
You don't think mine are limited
to writing checks, do you?

202
00:17:56,448 --> 00:17:58,712
In another life...

203
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:05,251
I arranged a number of operations of...
questionable legality.

204
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:10,225
I'd take his word for it, if I were you.

205
00:18:12,164 --> 00:18:16,430
So don't worry.
I'll make all the arrangements.

206
00:18:18,103 --> 00:18:19,195
No.

207
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:27,606
I'd really need your help here.

208
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,242
Ian... I'm not gonna let you steal
the Declaration of Independence.

209
00:18:33,318 --> 00:18:35,513
OK.

210
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:38,920
From this point on
all you're going to be is a hindrance.

211
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,556
Hey!

212
00:18:42,628 --> 00:18:46,564
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna shoot me, Shaw?

213
00:18:47,165 --> 00:18:49,963
Well, you can't shoot me.
There's more to the riddle.

214
00:18:50,035 --> 00:18:53,300
Information you don't have. I do.

215
00:18:53,372 --> 00:18:56,432
I'm the only one who can figure it out,
and you know that.

216
00:18:56,508 --> 00:18:58,840
He's bluffing.

217
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,572
We played poker together, Ian.
You know I can't bluff.

218
00:19:01,647 --> 00:19:04,047
Tell me what I need to know, Ben,

219
00:19:04,116 --> 00:19:06,380
or I'll shoot your friend.

220
00:19:06,451 --> 00:19:07,884
Hey!

221
00:19:07,953 --> 00:19:10,285
Quiet, Riley!
Your job's finished here.

222
00:19:14,993 --> 00:19:19,191
Look where you're standing.
All that gunpowder.

223
00:19:19,264 --> 00:19:23,098
You shoot me,
I drop this, we all go up.

224
00:19:24,503 --> 00:19:25,868
Ben...

225
00:19:27,139 --> 00:19:30,267
What happens when the flare burns down?

226
00:19:31,843 --> 00:19:34,505
Tell me what I need to know, Ben.

227
00:19:36,481 --> 00:19:38,108
You need to know...

228
00:19:38,183 --> 00:19:40,151
if Shaw can catch.

229
00:19:46,024 --> 00:19:47,685
Nice try, though.

230
00:19:59,071 --> 00:20:01,062
Get out, Shaw!

231
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:11,342
Fool!

232
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:17,552
Riley, get over here!

233
00:20:22,961 --> 00:20:25,521
- What is this?
- Smuggler's hold. Get in!

234
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,502
Move! Get out of here!

235
00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:34,232
- What?
- Move! Get out!

236
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:37,398
Follow me.

237
00:20:41,046 --> 00:20:42,877
Let's go, let's go!
She's gonna blow!

238
00:20:49,955 --> 00:20:52,116
Get down.

239
00:21:23,088 --> 00:21:26,649
OK, let's go.
Before someone sees the smoke.

240
00:21:57,355 --> 00:22:00,381
There's an Inuit village
about nine miles east of here.

241
00:22:00,459 --> 00:22:04,486
- It's popular with bush pilots.
- All right.

242
00:22:09,434 --> 00:22:13,063
- Then what are we gonna do?
- Start making our way back home.

243
00:22:13,138 --> 00:22:17,507
No, I meant about Ian. He's gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence, Ben.

244
00:22:18,743 --> 00:22:20,438
We stop him.

245
00:22:38,497 --> 00:22:39,828
<i>Is it really so hard to believe</i>

246
00:22:39,898 --> 00:22:42,366
that someone's gonna try to steal
the Declaration of Independence?

247
00:22:42,434 --> 00:22:44,902
<i>The FBI gets 10,000 tips a week.</i>

248
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,370
They're not gonna worry about
something they're sure is safe.

249
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:49,999
But anyone that can do anything
is gonna think we're crazy.

250
00:22:50,075 --> 00:22:53,203
Anyone crazy enough to believe us
isn't gonna want to help.

251
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:58,079
We don't need someone crazy. But one
step short of crazy, what do you get?

252
00:22:58,149 --> 00:22:59,810
Obsessed.

253
00:22:59,885 --> 00:23:01,580
Passionate.

254
00:23:09,394 --> 00:23:11,692
Excuse me.

255
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:18,962
- Dr. Chase can see you now, Mr. Brown.
- Thank you.

256
00:23:19,037 --> 00:23:20,299
<i>Mr. Brown?</i>

257
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:23,739
The family name doesn't get a lot
of respect in the academic community.

258
00:23:23,808 --> 00:23:25,901
Huh. Being kept down by the man.

259
00:23:28,313 --> 00:23:30,247
A very cute man.

260
00:23:30,315 --> 00:23:32,647
Thank you.

261
00:23:32,717 --> 00:23:34,878
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Hi.

262
00:23:35,453 --> 00:23:37,614
- Abigail Chase.
- Paul Brown.

263
00:23:37,689 --> 00:23:40,055
- Nice to meet you.
- Bill.

264
00:23:40,525 --> 00:23:42,652
Nice to meet you, Bill.

265
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:45,992
- How may I help you?
- Your accent. Pennsylvania Dutch?

266
00:23:46,064 --> 00:23:48,999
- Saxony German.
- Oh!

267
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:51,900
- You're not American?
- Oh, I am an American.

268
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,064
I just wasn't born here.
Please don't touch that!

269
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,701
Sorry. A neat collection.
George Washington's campaign buttons.

270
00:23:58,777 --> 00:24:01,439
You're missing the 1789 inaugural, though.

271
00:24:01,513 --> 00:24:04,505
- I found one once.
- That's very fortunate for you.

272
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:07,552
Now, you told my assistant
that this was an urgent matter.

273
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:09,780
Ah. Yes, ma'am.

274
00:24:09,854 --> 00:24:12,618
Well, I'm gonna get straight to the point.

275
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:17,592
Someone's gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence.

276
00:24:20,098 --> 00:24:22,225
It's true.

277
00:24:23,802 --> 00:24:25,929
I think I'd better put you gentlemen
in touch with the FBI.

278
00:24:26,004 --> 00:24:27,904
- We've been to the FBI.
- And?

279
00:24:27,973 --> 00:24:31,409
They assured us that the Declaration
cannot possibly be stolen.

280
00:24:31,476 --> 00:24:34,036
- They're right.
- My friend and I are less certain.

281
00:24:34,112 --> 00:24:38,105
However, if we were given the privilege
of examining the document...

282
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,877
we would be able to tell you for certain
if it were actually in any danger.

283
00:24:42,954 --> 00:24:44,979
What do you think you're gonna find?

284
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:51,518
We believe that there's an...
encryption on the back.

285
00:24:52,063 --> 00:24:54,964
- An encryption, like a code?
- Yes, ma'am.

286
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:57,024
Of what?

287
00:24:57,102 --> 00:25:00,094
Uh... a cartograph.

288
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:02,469
- A map.
- Yes, ma'am.

289
00:25:02,941 --> 00:25:05,705
A map of what?

290
00:25:05,777 --> 00:25:08,405
<i>The location of...</i>

291
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:16,387
...of hidden items
of historic and intrinsic value.

292
00:25:17,956 --> 00:25:21,448
- A treasure map?
- That's where we lost the FBI.

293
00:25:21,526 --> 00:25:24,461
You're treasure-hunters, aren't you?

294
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:26,895
We're more like treasure-protectors.

295
00:25:27,499 --> 00:25:32,061
Mr. Brown, I have personally seen the back
of the Declaration of Independence,

296
00:25:32,137 --> 00:25:36,437
and I promise you, the only thing there
is a notation that reads,

297
00:25:36,508 --> 00:25:38,476
"Original Declaration of Independence,
dated...

298
00:25:38,543 --> 00:25:41,444
"Four of July, 1776." Yes, ma'am.

299
00:25:41,513 --> 00:25:43,310
But no map.

300
00:25:56,528 --> 00:25:58,792
It's invisible.

301
00:25:58,863 --> 00:26:00,660
Oh! Right.

302
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:05,163
And that's where we lost
the Department of Homeland Security.

303
00:26:05,236 --> 00:26:08,399
What led you to assume
there's this invisible map?

304
00:26:08,873 --> 00:26:11,865
We found an engraving
on the stem of a 200-year-old pipe.

305
00:26:11,943 --> 00:26:14,343
Owned by Freemasons.

306
00:26:14,412 --> 00:26:18,746
- May I see the pipe?
- Uh, we don't have it.

307
00:26:20,785 --> 00:26:24,221
- Did Big Foot take it?
- It was nice meeting you.

308
00:26:24,823 --> 00:26:26,882
Nice to meet you, too.

309
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:29,991
And, you know,
that really is a nice collection.

310
00:26:30,061 --> 00:26:33,428
Must have taken you a long time
to hunt down all that history.

311
00:26:37,535 --> 00:26:40,766
If it's any consolation,
you had me convinced.

312
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:43,307
It's not.

313
00:26:43,374 --> 00:26:47,174
I was thinking, what if we go public,
plaster the story all over the Internet?

314
00:26:47,245 --> 00:26:51,614
It's not like
we have our reputations to worry about.

315
00:26:51,683 --> 00:26:56,086
Although I don't think
that's exactly gonna scare Ian away.

316
00:26:58,423 --> 00:27:01,654
180 years of searching,
and I'm three feet away.

317
00:27:02,594 --> 00:27:05,188
Of all the ideas
that became the United States,

318
00:27:05,263 --> 00:27:09,461
there's a line here
that's at the heart of all the others.

319
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:13,026
"But when a long train of abuses
and usurpations,

320
00:27:13,104 --> 00:27:15,800
pursuing invariably the same object,

321
00:27:15,874 --> 00:27:19,833
evinces a design to reduce them
under absolute despotism,

322
00:27:19,911 --> 00:27:23,847
it is their right, it is their duty
to throw off such government

323
00:27:23,915 --> 00:27:27,407
and provide new guards
for their future security. "

324
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,484
People don't talk that way anymore.

325
00:27:31,556 --> 00:27:33,547
Beautiful, huh?

326
00:27:35,126 --> 00:27:38,186
- No idea what you said.
- It means, if there's something wrong,

327
00:27:38,263 --> 00:27:42,632
those who have the ability to take action
have the responsibility to take action.

328
00:27:47,672 --> 00:27:49,606
I'm gonna steal it.

329
00:27:51,943 --> 00:27:53,706
<i>What?</i>

330
00:27:54,746 --> 00:27:57,977
I'm gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence.

331
00:28:02,153 --> 00:28:04,951
Uh... Ben?

332
00:28:05,857 --> 00:28:08,291
<i>This is... huge.</i>

333
00:28:08,893 --> 00:28:11,487
It's prison huge.

334
00:28:11,563 --> 00:28:13,963
You are gonna go to prison,
you know that?

335
00:28:14,032 --> 00:28:16,432
Yeah, probably.

336
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:19,026
So that would bother most people.

337
00:28:19,704 --> 00:28:24,437
Ian's gonna try and steal it. And if he
succeeds, he'll destroy the Declaration.

338
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:27,876
<i>The fact is, the only way to protect
the Declaration is to steal it.</i>

339
00:28:27,946 --> 00:28:30,540
It's upside down.

340
00:28:31,883 --> 00:28:34,317
I don't think there's a choice.

341
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:37,544
Ben, for God's sakes,

342
00:28:37,622 --> 00:28:41,251
it's like stealing a national monument. OK?

343
00:28:41,326 --> 00:28:43,521
It's like stealing him.

344
00:28:43,595 --> 00:28:48,328
<i>It can't be done. Not shouldn't be done.
It can't be done.</i>

345
00:28:49,701 --> 00:28:52,101
Let me prove it to you.

346
00:28:52,203 --> 00:28:54,899
OK, Ben, pay attention.

347
00:28:54,973 --> 00:28:57,874
I've brought you to the Library of Congress.

348
00:28:57,942 --> 00:29:01,571
Why? Because it's the biggest library
in the world.

349
00:29:01,646 --> 00:29:03,807
Over 20 million books.

350
00:29:03,882 --> 00:29:06,350
And they're all saying
the same exact thing:

351
00:29:06,417 --> 00:29:08,783
Listen to Riley.

352
00:29:08,853 --> 00:29:13,620
What we have here, my friend,
is an entire layout of the archives.

353
00:29:13,691 --> 00:29:16,182
Short of builders' blueprints.

354
00:29:16,261 --> 00:29:20,288
You've got construction orders,
phone lines,

355
00:29:21,165 --> 00:29:24,032
water and sewage -
it's all here.

356
00:29:24,102 --> 00:29:27,196
Now, when the Declaration
is on display, OK,

357
00:29:27,272 --> 00:29:30,867
it is surrounded by guards
and video monitors

358
00:29:30,942 --> 00:29:34,901
<i>and a little family from Iowa and little kids
on their eighth-grade field trip.</i>

359
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:39,746
<i>And beneath an inch of bulletproof glass
is an army of sensors and heat monitors</i>

360
00:29:39,817 --> 00:29:43,116
<i>that will go off if someone gets too close
with a high fever.</i>

361
00:29:43,988 --> 00:29:46,616
Now, when it's not on display,

362
00:29:47,525 --> 00:29:54,727
it is lowered into a four-foot-thick
concrete, steel-plated vault...

363
00:29:55,433 --> 00:29:59,870
that happens to be equipped
with an electronic combination lock

364
00:29:59,938 --> 00:30:01,997
and biometric access-denial systems.

365
00:30:02,073 --> 00:30:05,804
You know, Thomas Edison tried and failed
nearly 2,000 times

366
00:30:05,877 --> 00:30:09,836
to develop the carbonized cotton-thread
filament for the incandescent light bulb.

367
00:30:09,914 --> 00:30:11,313
Edison?

368
00:30:11,382 --> 00:30:13,475
When asked about it,
he said, "I didn't fail,

369
00:30:13,551 --> 00:30:16,349
I found out 2,000 ways
how not to make a light bulb. "

370
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:19,822
But he only needed to find one way
to make it work.

371
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,123
The Preservation Room.
Enjoy. Go ahead.

372
00:30:27,065 --> 00:30:29,863
Do you know
what the Preservation Room is for?

373
00:30:29,934 --> 00:30:32,459
Delicious jams and jellies?

374
00:30:32,537 --> 00:30:35,199
No. That's where they clean,
repair and maintain

375
00:30:35,273 --> 00:30:37,104
all the documents
and the storage housings

376
00:30:37,175 --> 00:30:39,439
when they're not on display or in the vault.

377
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:43,776
Now, when the case needs work they take
it out of the vault, directly across the hall

378
00:30:43,848 --> 00:30:45,679
<i>and into the Preservation Room.</i>

379
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:49,686
<i>The best time for us. Or Ian. To steal it
would be during the gala this weekend</i>

380
00:30:49,754 --> 00:30:52,882
<i>when the guards are distracted
by the VIPs upstairs.</i>

381
00:30:52,957 --> 00:30:59,055
But we'll make our way to the Preservation
Room, where there's much less security.

382
00:31:00,064 --> 00:31:01,861
Huh.

383
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:04,299
Well, if Ian...

384
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:06,360
Uh...

385
00:31:06,437 --> 00:31:09,065
Preservation... Hm.

386
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,165
The gala, huh?

387
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:15,577
This might be possible.

388
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,111
It might.

389
00:31:50,214 --> 00:31:51,442
Ah...

390
00:31:51,916 --> 00:31:54,282
And we are in.

391
00:32:06,164 --> 00:32:08,962
<i>There you are.
Hello.</i>

392
00:32:13,037 --> 00:32:15,028
The hallway.

393
00:32:21,312 --> 00:32:22,973
That's what I want.

394
00:32:36,661 --> 00:32:38,652
Game on.

395
00:33:12,964 --> 00:33:14,363
I'll buy that.

396
00:33:19,604 --> 00:33:21,094
Cool.

397
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:55,268
This just came for you.

398
00:33:55,907 --> 00:33:58,375
I hope it's not from Stan.

399
00:34:00,511 --> 00:34:05,073
"For the woman who has everything else...
Thanks for listening. Paul Brown. "

400
00:34:49,827 --> 00:34:51,454
Abigail Chase.

401
00:35:07,545 --> 00:35:08,603
Hey, Mike.

402
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:15,546
<i>- Let's do this by the book.
- Hallway is secure.</i>

403
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,986
<i>- Keep the document level.
- No problem.</i>

404
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:19,778
<i>What have you got?</i>

405
00:35:19,857 --> 00:35:21,825
<i>The heat sensor went off
in the Declaration frame.</i>

406
00:35:21,892 --> 00:35:25,487
<i>Run full diagnostics.
Then I want them all changed out.</i>

407
00:35:25,563 --> 00:35:28,259
Our evil plan is working.

408
00:36:07,938 --> 00:36:09,963
Ben, are you sure that we should?

409
00:36:13,444 --> 00:36:14,775
<i>Riley.</i>

410
00:36:15,346 --> 00:36:17,712
<i>- Can you hear me?
- Unfortunately. Yeah.</i>

411
00:36:17,782 --> 00:36:19,511
<i>We're all set in here.</i>

412
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:22,916
You want to go around to the front
and present your invitation.

413
00:36:22,987 --> 00:36:25,785
You're gonna have to show ID.
Go ahead, man.

414
00:36:30,194 --> 00:36:32,185
Howdy.

415
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:40,230
I need your invitation
and your ID, please.

416
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:00,753
<i>How do you look?</i>

417
00:37:00,825 --> 00:37:03,885
<i>- Not bad.
- Mazel tov.</i>

418
00:37:11,235 --> 00:37:13,226
This is it.

419
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:48,495
For you.

420
00:37:48,572 --> 00:37:51,006
- Oh, Mr. Brown.
- Dr. Chase.

421
00:37:51,075 --> 00:37:54,442
<i>- What are you doing here?
- Is that that hot girl?</i>

422
00:37:54,512 --> 00:37:59,609
<i>- How does she look?
- I made a last-minute donation. A big one.</i>

423
00:37:59,683 --> 00:38:02,345
Well, on that subject,
thank you for your wonderful gift.

424
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,389
- Oh, you did get it? Good.
- Yes, thank you.

425
00:38:05,456 --> 00:38:09,620
You know, I really couldn't accept
something like that normally, but...

426
00:38:09,693 --> 00:38:11,684
I really want it.

427
00:38:11,762 --> 00:38:15,027
<i>- Well, you needed it.
- Come on. Romeo. Get outta there.</i>

428
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:19,126
I have been wondering, though,
what the engraving indicated

429
00:38:19,203 --> 00:38:22,434
<i>- on the pipe that Big Foot took.
- Hi.</i>

430
00:38:22,873 --> 00:38:27,173
- Here you go.
- Oh, Dr. Herbert, this is Mr. Brown.

431
00:38:27,244 --> 00:38:28,370
- Hi.
- Hi there.

432
00:38:28,446 --> 00:38:31,973
<i>- Who's the stiff?
- Here, why don't you let me take that?</i>

433
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:35,610
<i>- So you can take that off his hands.
- Thank you.</i>

434
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,881
A toast, yeah?

435
00:38:38,956 --> 00:38:41,117
To high treason.

436
00:38:41,192 --> 00:38:44,593
That's what these men were committing
when they signed the Declaration.

437
00:38:44,662 --> 00:38:49,895
Had we lost the war, they would have been
hanged, beheaded, drawn and quartered,

438
00:38:49,967 --> 00:38:54,461
and - Oh! Oh, my personal favorite -
and had their entrails cut out and burned!

439
00:38:56,674 --> 00:39:01,634
So, here's to the men
who did what was considered wrong

440
00:39:01,712 --> 00:39:04,806
in order to do what they knew was right.

441
00:39:06,116 --> 00:39:07,981
What they knew was right.

442
00:39:19,463 --> 00:39:21,363
Well, good night.

443
00:39:21,432 --> 00:39:23,662
- Good night.
- Good night.

444
00:39:39,717 --> 00:39:42,083
<i>Yeah!</i>

445
00:39:43,721 --> 00:39:44,915
OK, go! Go!

446
00:39:57,768 --> 00:39:59,429
This better work.

447
00:40:05,843 --> 00:40:06,571
Clear!

448
00:40:12,016 --> 00:40:15,508
- On.
- Door one. 30 seconds.

449
00:40:24,395 --> 00:40:26,386
How does it look?

450
00:40:28,499 --> 00:40:31,764
It's working.
It's working...

451
00:40:31,835 --> 00:40:33,268
Unbelievable.

452
00:40:54,325 --> 00:40:56,225
Second door. 90 seconds.

453
00:41:09,173 --> 00:41:11,801
Well done, boys. Let's go.

454
00:41:24,888 --> 00:41:27,379
- We're in the elevator.
- OK.

455
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:29,688
I'm gonna turn off
the surveillance cameras. Ready?

456
00:41:30,294 --> 00:41:32,728
<i>In five. Four.</i>

457
00:41:32,796 --> 00:41:34,957
Three... Now.

458
00:41:36,834 --> 00:41:38,096
Ben Gates,

459
00:41:38,168 --> 00:41:40,830
you are now the Invisible Man.

460
00:41:45,976 --> 00:41:48,774
- I'm here.
- Give me the letters for her password.

461
00:41:48,846 --> 00:41:51,007
What do you got for me?

462
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:55,446
Hit me with it.

463
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:57,510
A- E-F-G...

464
00:41:57,588 --> 00:42:00,557
<i>L- O-R-V-Y.</i>

465
00:42:01,058 --> 00:42:04,050
Anagrams being listed.

466
00:42:04,128 --> 00:42:06,187
OK.

467
00:42:06,263 --> 00:42:08,959
Top results: "A glove fry. "

468
00:42:09,033 --> 00:42:10,591
"A very golf. "

469
00:42:10,668 --> 00:42:12,533
"Fargo levy. "

470
00:42:12,603 --> 00:42:14,867
"Gravy floe. Valey frog. "

471
00:42:14,938 --> 00:42:17,839
Also "Ago fly rev. "

472
00:42:17,908 --> 00:42:20,308
Uh... "Grove fly a. "

473
00:42:20,377 --> 00:42:22,208
"Are fly gov. "

474
00:42:22,279 --> 00:42:24,509
"Era fly gov. "

475
00:42:24,581 --> 00:42:26,913
<i>- "Elf gov ray. "
- It's "Valley Forge. "</i>

476
00:42:27,851 --> 00:42:30,479
"Valley For... "
I don't have that on my computer.

477
00:42:30,554 --> 00:42:33,648
It's "Valley Forge" -
she pressed the E and L twice.

478
00:42:39,863 --> 00:42:41,854
<i>We're in.</i>

479
00:42:45,836 --> 00:42:48,361
<i>Hello.</i>

480
00:42:53,143 --> 00:42:55,202
Ben, you're doing great.

481
00:43:03,987 --> 00:43:06,012
Ben, pick it up.

482
00:43:14,765 --> 00:43:16,733
You got about one...

483
00:43:21,438 --> 00:43:22,769
We own video.

484
00:43:23,574 --> 00:43:26,168
- I lost my feed.
- What?

485
00:43:26,243 --> 00:43:28,074
I lost my feed, Ben.

486
00:43:28,145 --> 00:43:30,170
<i>I don't know where anyone is.
I have nothing.</i>

487
00:43:30,247 --> 00:43:31,771
Ben, I have no...
Ben, I have nothing.

488
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:34,579
Get out of there.
Get out of there now.

489
00:43:34,651 --> 00:43:37,211
I'm taking the whole thing.
I'll get it out in the elevator.

490
00:43:37,287 --> 00:43:40,051
What are you talking about?
Is it heavy?

491
00:43:45,596 --> 00:43:48,121
Shaw. Door three, one minute.

492
00:44:04,081 --> 00:44:05,605
Gates.

493
00:44:10,154 --> 00:44:12,281
What was that?

494
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:16,256
Who's shooting?

495
00:44:17,895 --> 00:44:20,159
- Damn.
- He's got the bloody map!

496
00:44:20,597 --> 00:44:23,259
Are you still there? Ben?

497
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:24,960
I'm in the elevator.

498
00:44:25,569 --> 00:44:30,768
- Ian’s here. There was, uh, shooting.
- I hate that guy.

499
00:44:35,479 --> 00:44:39,973
Hey, Rebecca.
Do you have a Paul Brown on that list?

500
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,540
Paul Brown?

501
00:44:41,618 --> 00:44:43,210
Uh, no. Not here.

502
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,731
Have a good night.

503
00:45:05,876 --> 00:45:08,811
Are you trying to steal that?

504
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,311
Oh, uh...

505
00:45:13,851 --> 00:45:15,580
It's $35.

506
00:45:17,154 --> 00:45:19,452
- For this?
- Yeah.

507
00:45:19,523 --> 00:45:22,651
- That's a lot.
- Hey, I don't make the prices.

508
00:45:25,596 --> 00:45:27,723
It's, um...

509
00:45:30,067 --> 00:45:31,659
I have $32...

510
00:45:35,873 --> 00:45:37,704
57 c.

511
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:40,900
We take Visa.

512
00:45:50,454 --> 00:45:52,888
This is Mike. Sublevel three.
I have an alert.

513
00:45:52,956 --> 00:45:55,618
<i>Where are you, Ben?</i>

514
00:46:20,217 --> 00:46:22,811
<i>- Where are you?
- Stop talking.</i>

515
00:46:24,288 --> 00:46:26,552
Start the van.

516
00:46:32,796 --> 00:46:37,995
Ben, the...
the mean Declaration lady's behind you.

517
00:46:42,773 --> 00:46:44,536
Hey.

518
00:46:44,608 --> 00:46:47,202
Oh, it's you. Hello.

519
00:46:47,277 --> 00:46:49,973
Mr. Brown, what's going on?
What's that?

520
00:46:50,881 --> 00:46:53,213
- It's a souvenir.
- Really?

521
00:46:53,283 --> 00:46:55,308
Stop chatting and get in the van.

522
00:47:01,124 --> 00:47:03,058
Code red. Code red.
We have a break-in.

523
00:47:03,126 --> 00:47:07,028
Lock it down. Nobody leaves the building.
Get the FBI on the phone.

524
00:47:11,201 --> 00:47:13,829
- Did you enjoy the party?
- Yeah.

525
00:47:17,808 --> 00:47:20,834
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God! You did not?

526
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:23,638
- No...
- Security! Over here!

527
00:47:23,714 --> 00:47:25,705
- Give me that!
- It's yours. Take it.

528
00:47:26,383 --> 00:47:28,112
- Security!
- Uh-uh-uh.

529
00:47:28,185 --> 00:47:32,121
- Over here! Security!
- Got you.

530
00:47:32,823 --> 00:47:33,812
Go.

531
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:35,983
Viktor! Move!

532
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:38,152
- We can't just let her go!
- We can. Go!

533
00:47:39,496 --> 00:47:42,192
- Security, over here!
- Wait. No, hold it.

534
00:47:42,265 --> 00:47:43,892
Hold it!

535
00:47:46,103 --> 00:47:47,092
- Wha?
- Oh, bad.

536
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:48,660
- What do you want?
- Give me the document.

537
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:50,730
Bad, bad, bad!

538
00:47:54,511 --> 00:47:56,308
- Let me go!
- Just bring her!

539
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,813
No! No!

540
00:48:04,888 --> 00:48:06,719
- That's...
- Go! Go!

541
00:48:16,566 --> 00:48:18,659
And just who might you be?

542
00:48:22,272 --> 00:48:25,241
- Once we catch them what do we do?
- I'm working on it.

543
00:48:27,144 --> 00:48:28,543
Right turn, right turn.

544
00:48:30,247 --> 00:48:34,013
Why don't you just pass me that
document? Then we can all go home.

545
00:48:46,296 --> 00:48:47,729
Oh, no.

546
00:49:02,412 --> 00:49:03,936
Skidding, skidding, skidding.

547
00:49:10,587 --> 00:49:12,817
- Oh, no!
- Holy Lord!

548
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:21,162
- Help!
- No! If she falls, the document falls.

549
00:49:22,365 --> 00:49:24,390
Get me next to her.

550
00:49:45,355 --> 00:49:47,289
- Thank you.
- No!

551
00:49:47,357 --> 00:49:49,985
Got it. Go on.

552
00:49:50,961 --> 00:49:52,656
Abigail!

553
00:49:54,397 --> 00:49:57,025
<i>Come on. Jump.</i>

554
00:50:05,542 --> 00:50:10,036
- We lost them.
- That's all right. This... is what we need.

555
00:50:20,357 --> 00:50:23,019
Well done, Gates. Well done.

556
00:50:25,462 --> 00:50:28,124
<i>- Are you all right?
- No! Those lunatics...</i>

557
00:50:28,198 --> 00:50:30,758
- You're not hurt, are you?
- You are all lunatics!

558
00:50:30,834 --> 00:50:32,358
- Are you hungry?
- What?!

559
00:50:32,435 --> 00:50:33,834
Are you all right?

560
00:50:33,904 --> 00:50:37,863
Still a little on edge from being shot at,
but I'll be OK. Thanks for asking.

561
00:50:37,941 --> 00:50:41,672
Yeah, well, I'm not all right. Those men
have the Declaration of Independence!

562
00:50:41,745 --> 00:50:44,942
- She lost it?!
- They don't have it.

563
00:50:46,716 --> 00:50:50,243
See? OK?
Now could you please stop shouting?

564
00:50:51,388 --> 00:50:54,915
- Give me that!
- You're still shouting. It's starting to annoy.

565
00:50:55,458 --> 00:50:58,894
You'd do well, Dr. Chase,
to be a bit more civilized in this instance.

566
00:50:59,229 --> 00:51:01,891
If this is the real one, what did they get?

567
00:51:02,299 --> 00:51:04,096
A souvenir.

568
00:51:04,167 --> 00:51:07,762
I thought it'd be a good idea to have
a duplicate. It turned out I was right.

569
00:51:08,238 --> 00:51:14,575
I actually had to pay for the souvenir and
the real one, so you owe me $35, plus tax.

570
00:51:15,078 --> 00:51:17,979
- Genius.
- Who were those men?

571
00:51:18,048 --> 00:51:20,516
Just the guys we warned you
were gonna steal the Declaration.

572
00:51:20,584 --> 00:51:22,415
And you didn't believe us.

573
00:51:22,485 --> 00:51:25,113
We did the only thing we could do
to keep it safe.

574
00:51:26,289 --> 00:51:27,847
<i>Verdammt! Give me that!</i>

575
00:51:27,924 --> 00:51:30,188
You know something?
You're shouting again.

576
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,251
I'm pretty sure she was swearing, too.

577
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:35,423
Well, we probably deserve that.

578
00:51:41,938 --> 00:51:44,133
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

579
00:51:44,207 --> 00:51:48,576
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is
Peter Sadusky. I'm the agent in charge.

580
00:51:48,645 --> 00:51:51,705
I wanna reassure you,
you are not in danger in any way.

581
00:51:51,781 --> 00:51:56,582
If we all cooperate, we'll get through this
with as little frustration as possible.

582
00:51:57,053 --> 00:51:59,044
Thank you.

583
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:05,023
Get positive IDs. Search everyone,
including the security staff.

584
00:52:05,095 --> 00:52:07,393
If they refuse,
detain them and get warrants.

585
00:52:07,464 --> 00:52:10,490
<i>Agent Hendricks? You have something?</i>

586
00:52:11,234 --> 00:52:11,928
Um...

587
00:52:12,002 --> 00:52:16,462
- This isn't a day for "Um... "
- We got a tip several days ago

588
00:52:16,539 --> 00:52:19,599
that someone was going to steal
the Declaration of Independence.

589
00:52:19,676 --> 00:52:22,611
Do we have a name on the tipster?

590
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:26,274
There was no file opened.
We didn't find the information credible.

591
00:52:27,851 --> 00:52:29,580
How about now?

592
00:52:29,653 --> 00:52:33,749
<i>There is not a treasure map on the back
of the Declaration of Independence.</i>

593
00:52:33,823 --> 00:52:37,759
And there's no chance
anyone can steal this either.

594
00:52:38,762 --> 00:52:42,129
I leveled with you 100 percent.
Everything I told you was the truth.

595
00:52:42,198 --> 00:52:44,359
I want that document, Mr. Brown.

596
00:52:44,801 --> 00:52:47,497
OK, my name's not Brown.
It's Gates.

597
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:49,936
I leveled with you 98 percent.

598
00:52:50,006 --> 00:52:52,702
Wait a minute, did you just say "Gates"?

599
00:52:53,743 --> 00:52:55,404
Gates?

600
00:52:55,478 --> 00:52:58,970
You're that family with the conspiracy
theory about the Founding Fathers?

601
00:52:59,049 --> 00:53:02,450
- It's not a conspiracy theory.
- Per se.

602
00:53:02,519 --> 00:53:06,353
You know what? I take it back.
You're not liars. You're insane.

603
00:53:06,423 --> 00:53:08,653
There's a copy of the Declaration
on display now?

604
00:53:08,725 --> 00:53:10,920
- Yes, we decided to...
- Leave it there.

605
00:53:10,994 --> 00:53:13,588
The guests know something happened,
but they don't know what.

606
00:53:13,663 --> 00:53:16,860
They got him with a Taser at the service
entrance. He doesn't remember a thing.

607
00:53:16,933 --> 00:53:19,060
Also, we found bullet casings.

608
00:53:19,135 --> 00:53:20,796
Did we get a description
from the other guards?

609
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:23,862
- Which guards?
- The guards that were fired upon.

610
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:28,070
There weren't any other guards
on patrol down here.

611
00:53:28,378 --> 00:53:30,573
So...

612
00:53:30,647 --> 00:53:33,878
who was shooting,
who were they shooting at,

613
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:36,316
and why weren't they getting along?

614
00:53:36,386 --> 00:53:39,219
You can't seriously intend
to run chemical tests

615
00:53:39,289 --> 00:53:42,486
on the Declaration of Independence
in the back of a moving van.

616
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,220
We have a clean-room environment
all set up.

617
00:53:44,294 --> 00:53:47,525
EDS suits, a particulate air filtration
system, the whole shebang.

618
00:53:47,597 --> 00:53:50,157
- Really?
- We can't go back there.

619
00:53:50,233 --> 00:53:51,996
What? Why not?

620
00:53:52,068 --> 00:53:55,902
This is the guy. Dr. Herbert said
Dr. Chase introduced him as Mr. Brown.

621
00:53:55,972 --> 00:53:57,269
Not on the guestlist.

622
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:01,470
Now, the gift-store clerk - she said
he seemed... Well, she said "flustered. "

623
00:54:01,544 --> 00:54:04,513
He tried to walk out with a copy
of the Declaration of Independence

624
00:54:04,581 --> 00:54:06,572
without paying.

625
00:54:06,649 --> 00:54:08,640
He paid with a Visa.

626
00:54:08,718 --> 00:54:11,881
"Charge to Benjamin Gates. "

627
00:54:11,955 --> 00:54:14,685
A credit-card slip?

628
00:54:14,758 --> 00:54:16,419
Dude, we're on the grid.

629
00:54:16,493 --> 00:54:19,360
They'll have your records from forever.
They'll have my records from forever.

630
00:54:19,429 --> 00:54:22,956
I know. I know. It's only a matter of minutes
before the FBI shows up at my front door.

631
00:54:23,032 --> 00:54:25,125
What do we do?

632
00:54:25,201 --> 00:54:27,931
- We need those letters.
- What letters?

633
00:54:30,373 --> 00:54:32,364
<i>You know, get off the road,
take a right.</i>

634
00:54:32,442 --> 00:54:34,273
<i>What letters?</i>

635
00:54:35,145 --> 00:54:40,173
You have the original Silence Dogood
letters? Did you steal those, too?

636
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:42,343
We have scans of the originals.

637
00:54:42,419 --> 00:54:45,286
- Quiet, please.
- How'd you get scans?

638
00:54:45,355 --> 00:54:48,916
Oh, I know the person
who has the originals. Now shush.

639
00:54:51,961 --> 00:54:56,364
- Why do you need them?
- She really can't shut her mouth, can she?

640
00:54:56,433 --> 00:55:00,096
I'll tell you what, look.
I will let you hold onto this

641
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:03,003
if you'll promise to shut up, please.

642
00:55:03,072 --> 00:55:05,632
Thank you.

643
00:55:06,342 --> 00:55:08,742
- Ben, you know what you have to do.
- I know what to do.

644
00:55:08,812 --> 00:55:11,542
I'm just trying to think
of anything else we could do.

645
00:55:11,614 --> 00:55:14,344
Well, not to be a, uh, nudge,

646
00:55:14,417 --> 00:55:18,444
but you do realize how many people
we have after us.

647
00:55:18,521 --> 00:55:21,820
We probably have
our own satellite by now.

648
00:55:22,992 --> 00:55:28,430
It took you all of two seconds to decide
to steal the Declaration of Independence.

649
00:55:28,498 --> 00:55:32,457
Yeah, but I didn't think I was gonna
personally have to tell my dad about it.

650
00:55:32,535 --> 00:55:35,197
Hey, not cool! Not cool!

651
00:55:35,271 --> 00:55:37,398
Let me go!

652
00:55:37,474 --> 00:55:39,738
OK. You're let go. Go, shoo.

653
00:55:39,809 --> 00:55:42,107
I'm not going. Not without the Declaration.

654
00:55:42,178 --> 00:55:45,147
<i>You're not going with the Declaration.</i>

655
00:55:45,215 --> 00:55:48,878
Yes, I am. I'm not letting it
out of my sight, so I'm going.

656
00:55:48,952 --> 00:55:52,183
Wait. You're not going with us
with the Declaration.

657
00:55:52,255 --> 00:55:55,554
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

658
00:55:56,593 --> 00:55:58,788
Look, if you wanted to leave me behind,

659
00:55:58,862 --> 00:56:02,320
you shouldn't have told me
where you were going.

660
00:56:18,014 --> 00:56:20,005
Clear.

661
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:23,014
What the...

662
00:56:24,454 --> 00:56:27,184
<i>Now we're getting somewhere.</i>

663
00:56:28,191 --> 00:56:31,991
<i>They're digital scans of letters
to the editor of The New England Courant.</i>

664
00:56:32,061 --> 00:56:34,791
Written 1722.

665
00:56:34,864 --> 00:56:39,233
They're all from the same person.
"Your humble servant, Silence Dogood. "

666
00:56:54,817 --> 00:56:56,785
Gentlemen...

667
00:56:56,853 --> 00:57:01,051
why is this word capitalized?

668
00:57:02,091 --> 00:57:04,958
Because it's important?

669
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:09,530
Because it's a name.

670
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,591
OK, I got it.
When Ben Franklin was only 15 years old

671
00:57:12,669 --> 00:57:15,604
he secretly wrote 14 letters
to his brother's newspaper

672
00:57:15,672 --> 00:57:19,369
pretending to be a middle-aged widow
named Silence Dogood.

673
00:57:19,442 --> 00:57:22,138
These letters were written
by Benjamin Franklin.

674
00:57:29,085 --> 00:57:31,485
<i>Looks OK.</i>

675
00:57:31,554 --> 00:57:34,182
- Park a couple of blocks away.
- Well, how long do you think we got?

676
00:57:34,257 --> 00:57:37,886
I'm gonna give them a couple of hours
at least. I hope.

677
00:57:37,961 --> 00:57:41,954
What do we do about her?
I've got some duct tape in the back.

678
00:57:42,031 --> 00:57:44,295
<i>No, that won't be necessary.
She won't be any trouble.</i>

679
00:57:44,367 --> 00:57:47,598
- Promise you won't be any trouble.
- I promise.

680
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:49,604
See? She's curious.

681
00:57:53,443 --> 00:57:57,903
Here's what I got on Gates. A degree
in American History from Georgetown,

682
00:57:57,981 --> 00:58:00,211
a degree in Mechanical Engineering
at MIT,

683
00:58:00,283 --> 00:58:03,775
Navy ROTC and Naval Diving
and Salvage Training Center.

684
00:58:03,853 --> 00:58:05,445
Hm.

685
00:58:05,521 --> 00:58:08,251
What in the world did this guy
want to be when he grew up?

686
00:58:08,324 --> 00:58:10,315
We keep our focus on Gates.

687
00:58:10,393 --> 00:58:12,725
Run him to ground.

688
00:58:12,795 --> 00:58:16,526
Compile a family-and-friends list.
Closest relative first.

689
00:58:17,033 --> 00:58:19,763
I want to find out who this guy is.

690
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,742
Dad.

691
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,141
Where's the party?

692
00:58:34,686 --> 00:58:36,847
Uh, well, uh...

693
00:58:36,921 --> 00:58:39,446
I'm in a little trouble.

694
00:58:39,524 --> 00:58:42,152
<i>- Is she pregnant?
- Well, if she is,</i>

695
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:46,687
are you gonna leave the woman carrying
your grandchild standing out in the cold?

696
00:58:46,765 --> 00:58:49,165
I look pregnant?

697
00:58:53,872 --> 00:58:57,103
This better not be about
that dumb treasure.

698
00:59:02,347 --> 00:59:05,009
Well, have a seat.
Make yourselves comfortable.

699
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:08,951
There's some pizza.
It's still warm, I think.

700
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,578
Dad...

701
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:17,527
I need the Silence Dogood letters.
Yeah, it's about the treasure.

702
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:19,620
And he dragged you two
into this nonsense?

703
00:59:19,697 --> 00:59:22,188
- Literally.
- I volunteered.

704
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:25,498
Well, unvolunteer,
before you waste your life.

705
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:28,596
- Knock it off, Dad.
- Sure, sure, I know, I'm the family kook.

706
00:59:28,673 --> 00:59:30,971
I have a job, a house, health insurance.

707
00:59:31,042 --> 00:59:35,206
At least I had your mother, for however
brief a time. At least I had you.

708
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,544
What do you have? Him?

709
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:42,947
Look, if you just give us the letters,
we're gone.

710
00:59:43,021 --> 00:59:44,955
You disappoint me, Ben.

711
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:50,120
Well, maybe that's the real Gates-family
legacy. Sons who disappoint their fathers.

712
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:54,257
Get out. Take your troubles with you.

713
00:59:59,671 --> 01:00:02,196
<i>I found the Charlotte.</i>

714
01:00:06,578 --> 01:00:08,569
<i>The Charlotte?</i>

715
01:00:09,447 --> 01:00:12,314
- You mean she was a ship?
- Yeah, she was beautiful.

716
01:00:12,383 --> 01:00:13,407
It was amazing, Dad.

717
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:16,249
And the treasure?

718
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:19,085
No, no. But we found another clue
that led us here.

719
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:21,853
Yeah, and that'll lead you
to another clue.

720
01:00:21,926 --> 01:00:24,520
And that's all you'll ever find,
is another clue. Don't you get it, Ben?

721
01:00:24,596 --> 01:00:26,029
I finally figured it out.

722
01:00:26,097 --> 01:00:29,362
The legend says that the treasure
was buried to keep it from the British.

723
01:00:29,434 --> 01:00:32,164
But what really happened
was the legend was invented,

724
01:00:32,237 --> 01:00:36,503
to keep the British occupied
searching for buried treasure.

725
01:00:36,574 --> 01:00:39,839
The treasure is a myth.

726
01:00:39,911 --> 01:00:42,277
I refuse to believe that.

727
01:00:47,485 --> 01:00:51,751
Well, you can believe what you want.
You're a grown person. What am I doing?

728
01:00:51,823 --> 01:00:55,054
Do what you want, Ben.
Do what you want.

729
01:00:56,561 --> 01:01:01,328
He's probably right. You don't even know
if there is another clue.

730
01:01:03,268 --> 01:01:07,864
Well, I can think of a way where we could
find out. And we can find out right now.

731
01:01:26,024 --> 01:01:28,117
Looks like animal skin.

732
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:31,923
- How old is it?
- At least 200 years.

733
01:01:31,996 --> 01:01:35,727
- Really? You sure?
- Pretty darn.

734
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,291
Now if this thing's in invisible ink,
how do we look at it?

735
01:01:38,369 --> 01:01:39,666
Throw it in the oven.

736
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:41,329
<i>- No.
- Uh-uh.</i>

737
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:44,068
Ferrous sulfate inks can only
be brought out with heat.

738
01:01:44,142 --> 01:01:47,339
- Yes, but this...
- It's very old.

739
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:53,112
This is very old, and we can't
risk compromising the map.

740
01:01:53,184 --> 01:01:54,412
You need a reagent.

741
01:01:54,485 --> 01:01:57,181
Dad, it's really late.
Why don't you get some rest?

742
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:59,746
I'm fine.

743
01:01:59,824 --> 01:02:01,655
Lemons.

744
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:10,598
- You can't do that.
- But it has to be done.

745
01:02:10,668 --> 01:02:14,968
Then someone who is trained to handle
antique documents is gonna do it.

746
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,874
OK.

747
01:02:19,711 --> 01:02:21,372
OK.

748
01:02:22,547 --> 01:02:25,607
Now, uh, if there is a secret message,

749
01:02:25,683 --> 01:02:30,985
it'll probably be marked by a symbol
in the upper right-hand corner.

750
01:02:31,055 --> 01:02:32,682
That's right.

751
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:38,861
I am so getting fired for this.

752
01:03:10,294 --> 01:03:13,092
I told you. You need heat.

753
01:03:31,149 --> 01:03:32,810
See?

754
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,613
- We need more juice.
- We need more heat.

755
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:54,570
That's not a map.

756
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:57,767
- Is it?
- More clues. What a surprise.

757
01:03:57,842 --> 01:03:59,537
<i>Are those latitudes and longitudes?</i>

758
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:02,170
That's why we need
the Silence Dogood letters.

759
01:04:02,246 --> 01:04:05,306
- That's the key?
- Yeah. "The key in Silence undetected. "

760
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:07,010
Dad, can we have the letters now?

761
01:04:07,085 --> 01:04:11,545
Will somebody please explain to me
what these magic numbers are?

762
01:04:11,622 --> 01:04:14,090
- It's an Ottendorf cipher.
- That's right.

763
01:04:14,158 --> 01:04:15,989
Oh, OK.

764
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,995
- What's an Ottendorf cipher?
- They're just codes.

765
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:23,397
Each of these three numbers
corresponds to a word in a key.

766
01:04:23,468 --> 01:04:26,301
Usually a random book
or a newspaper article.

767
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:28,531
<i>In this case,
the Silence Dogood letters.</i>

768
01:04:28,606 --> 01:04:31,006
So it's like the page number
of the key text,

769
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:34,408
the line on the page,
and the letter in that line.

770
01:04:34,479 --> 01:04:37,073
So, Dad, where are the letters?

771
01:04:37,148 --> 01:04:42,176
You know, it's just by sheer happenstance
that his grandfather...

772
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:43,447
- Dad.
... even found them.

773
01:04:43,521 --> 01:04:45,819
They were in an antique desk
from the press room...

774
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:47,551
<i>- Dad.
... of The New England Courant.</i>

775
01:04:47,625 --> 01:04:50,685
- That's a newspaper.
- Dad, where are the letters?

776
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:53,526
I don't have them, son.

777
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:56,362
- What?
- I don't have them.

778
01:05:03,241 --> 01:05:04,606
Where are they?

779
01:05:04,675 --> 01:05:08,167
I donated them to the Franklin Institute
in Philadelphia.

780
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:10,771
Time to go.

781
01:05:11,816 --> 01:05:16,480
I still can't believe it. All this time
no one knew what was on the back.

782
01:05:16,554 --> 01:05:18,021
- The back of what?
- Whoa!

783
01:05:18,089 --> 01:05:20,216
No!

784
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,782
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- I know.

785
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:25,488
Oh, my God. What have you done?
This is... this is the...

786
01:05:25,563 --> 01:05:28,327
- I know!
- This is the Declaration of Independence.

787
01:05:28,399 --> 01:05:31,562
Yes. And it's very delicate.

788
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:33,831
You stole it?

789
01:05:33,905 --> 01:05:39,275
Dad, I can explain, but I don't have time.
It was necessary. And you saw the cipher.

790
01:05:39,343 --> 01:05:42,073
And that will lead to another clue,
and that will lead to another clue!

791
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:45,513
There is no treasure.
I wasted 20 years of my life.

792
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:48,450
And now you've destroyed yours.

793
01:05:49,287 --> 01:05:51,448
And you pulled me into all this.

794
01:05:52,256 --> 01:05:55,089
Well, we can't have that.

795
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:02,324
<i>Come in!</i>

796
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,391
I'm in here.

797
01:06:05,369 --> 01:06:07,360
FBI, right?

798
01:06:11,242 --> 01:06:13,574
You gonna untie me?

799
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,748
And you have no idea where he's going?

800
01:06:18,816 --> 01:06:22,912
- Well, wouldn't I have told you if I did?
- Would you?

801
01:06:22,987 --> 01:06:25,114
He tied me to a chair.

802
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:29,250
The garage is empty, but there's a Cadillac
De Ville registered to Patrick Gates.

803
01:06:29,327 --> 01:06:31,386
And he stole my car.

804
01:06:31,829 --> 01:06:35,492
Don't worry, Mr. Gates, we'll find your car.
And your son.

805
01:06:38,102 --> 01:06:40,468
Your dad's got a sweet ride.

806
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:43,405
I think we should change clothes.

807
01:06:43,474 --> 01:06:45,999
We look kind of conspicuous,
don't you think?

808
01:06:46,077 --> 01:06:49,069
I'd love to go shopping, too,
but we have no money.

809
01:06:49,146 --> 01:06:51,205
Here, I took this from his house.

810
01:06:51,282 --> 01:06:54,945
He usually tucks a few hundred dollars
somewhere between those pages.

811
01:06:55,019 --> 01:06:59,251
<i>- Common Sense. How appropriate.
- When are we gonna get there?</i>

812
01:06:59,323 --> 01:07:02,918
I'm hungry. This car smells weird.

813
01:07:47,371 --> 01:07:49,498
Excuse me.

814
01:07:49,573 --> 01:07:52,508
Excuse me. Oops, sorry, sir. Excuse me.

815
01:07:52,576 --> 01:07:54,635
That's OK.

816
01:08:01,085 --> 01:08:03,178
S- S-A-N-D.

817
01:08:03,254 --> 01:08:05,950
<i>OK. Huh.</i>

818
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:09,086
You're sure this is right?

819
01:08:10,528 --> 01:08:11,893
OK.

820
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:13,794
S- S-A...

821
01:08:14,832 --> 01:08:16,629
No, N.

822
01:08:16,701 --> 01:08:19,932
- That is an N.
- It doesn't look like an N.

823
01:08:21,872 --> 01:08:25,205
You know what? Here. Last one. OK?

824
01:08:26,444 --> 01:08:28,708
- One more dollar.
- Thank you.

825
01:08:29,246 --> 01:08:31,407
Go get the last four letters.

826
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:33,916
Go get 'em, chief. Come on.

827
01:08:52,003 --> 01:08:56,440
OK. "The vision to see the treasured past

828
01:08:56,507 --> 01:09:02,969
comes as the timely shadow crosses
in front of the house of pass and... "

829
01:09:03,047 --> 01:09:05,675
"Pass and... " what?

830
01:09:19,163 --> 01:09:21,825
"Pass and... "

831
01:09:47,858 --> 01:09:50,383
What's going on?

832
01:09:52,496 --> 01:09:54,430
- I'm not sure.
- What's up?

833
01:09:56,967 --> 01:10:00,403
<i>So you show up at your father's
door and say you're in trouble</i>

834
01:10:00,471 --> 01:10:04,339
and the first thing he assumes
is I'm pregnant.

835
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:06,808
Is there a question in there?

836
01:10:06,877 --> 01:10:09,437
I think there's an interesting story
in there.

837
01:10:09,513 --> 01:10:13,574
Well, my father thinks I've been
a little too cavalier in my personal life.

838
01:10:13,651 --> 01:10:16,347
- I see.
- Let me ask you something.

839
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:19,355
Have you ever told someone -
not a relative - "I love you?"

840
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:21,653
Yes.

841
01:10:21,725 --> 01:10:24,387
More than one someone?

842
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:26,729
Yes.

843
01:10:26,797 --> 01:10:28,697
Oh. Well, then my father would say

844
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:32,167
you've been a little too cavalier
in your personal life, too.

845
01:10:32,236 --> 01:10:35,694
So you get your sense of absolute certainty
from him, do you?

846
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:37,707
Well, I'm sure I don't know
what you mean.

847
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:42,542
Well, you're certain the treasure is real,
despite what anyone else thinks.

848
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:44,103
No, but I hope it's real.

849
01:10:44,181 --> 01:10:48,709
I mean, I've dreamt it's real
since my grandfather told me about it.

850
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:52,051
But I want to hold it.
I feel like I'm so close, I can taste it.

851
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:56,856
But I just... I just want to know it's not just
something in my head or in my heart.

852
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:03,733
People don't really talk that way, you know.

853
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:07,430
I know. But they think that way.

854
01:11:13,544 --> 01:11:14,476
Hey.

855
01:11:14,545 --> 01:11:16,536
- Did you get it? Riley?
- Oh, I got it.

856
01:11:16,614 --> 01:11:20,380
"The vision to see
the treasured past comes

857
01:11:20,451 --> 01:11:25,821
as the timely shadow crosses
in front of the house of Pass and Stow. "

858
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:28,723
Now, "Pass and Stow," of course,
referring to...

859
01:11:28,792 --> 01:11:31,659
<i>- The Liberty Bell.
- Why do you have to do that?</i>

860
01:11:31,729 --> 01:11:34,220
Well, John Pass and John Stow
cast the bell.

861
01:11:34,298 --> 01:11:37,529
OK. Well, then, what does
the rest of this mean?

862
01:11:37,601 --> 01:11:42,334
Wait... "The vision to see the treasured
past" must refer to a way to read the map.

863
01:11:42,406 --> 01:11:43,930
Well, I thought the cipher was the map.

864
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:46,875
No, the cipher was a way
to find the way to read the map.

865
01:11:46,944 --> 01:11:48,605
And the way to read the map can be found

866
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:53,241
where the "timely shadow" crosses
in front of the Liberty Bell.

867
01:11:53,317 --> 01:11:56,582
Crosses in front of the "house"
of the Liberty Bell. Independence Hall.

868
01:11:56,654 --> 01:12:00,146
Right, so "timely shadow" -
it's a specific time.

869
01:12:00,658 --> 01:12:02,751
- Right.
- Uh, what time?

870
01:12:02,826 --> 01:12:05,624
What time? What time?

871
01:12:06,297 --> 01:12:09,528
Wait a minute, wait.
You're gonna love this.

872
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,229
Excuse me, can I see one of those
hundred-dollar bills I paid you with?

873
01:12:13,304 --> 01:12:14,896
No.

874
01:12:15,406 --> 01:12:18,864
Oh. Well, uh, here,
I have this diver's watch.

875
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:21,707
It's called a Submariner. I dive with it.
It's actually quite valuable.

876
01:12:21,779 --> 01:12:23,872
- You can use it as collateral.
- Whatever.

877
01:12:23,948 --> 01:12:25,472
Thank you.

878
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:28,279
On the back of a hundred-dollar bill
is an etching of Independence Hall

879
01:12:28,352 --> 01:12:29,979
- based on a painting done in...
- Hello.

880
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:32,352
Thank you.
... in the 1780s, who...

881
01:12:32,423 --> 01:12:35,881
The artist was actually a friend
of Benjamin Franklin's. It's wonderful.

882
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,552
<i>- Fascinating.
- Hold this.</i>

883
01:12:37,628 --> 01:12:39,653
OK.

884
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:42,257
I'm not going anywhere.

885
01:12:42,766 --> 01:12:46,361
Now, I think that if we look
at this clock tower...

886
01:12:47,471 --> 01:12:50,167
...we may find the specific time.

887
01:12:52,977 --> 01:12:56,174
<i>- What do you see?
- 2:22.</i>

888
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:59,648
- What time is it now?
- Almost three.

889
01:13:00,884 --> 01:13:04,217
- We missed it.
- No, we didn't.

890
01:13:04,288 --> 01:13:07,121
We didn't miss it because... uh...

891
01:13:07,191 --> 01:13:11,491
You don't know this? I-I know something
about history that you don't know.

892
01:13:11,562 --> 01:13:13,587
I'd be very excited to learn about it, Riley.

893
01:13:13,664 --> 01:13:16,997
Well, hold on one second, let me just...
let me just take in this moment.

894
01:13:17,067 --> 01:13:19,592
This is... this is cool.

895
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:23,470
Is this how you feel all the time? Because,
you know... Except for now, of course.

896
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:25,633
- Riley!
- All right.

897
01:13:25,709 --> 01:13:31,045
What I know is that daylight savings
wasn't established until World War I.

898
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:36,747
If it's 3pm now, OK, that means
in 1776, it would be 2pm.

899
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:38,811
- Let's go.
- Riley, you're a genius.

900
01:13:38,889 --> 01:13:41,153
Yeah.

901
01:13:41,225 --> 01:13:44,854
Do you actually know who the first person
to suggest daylight savings was?

902
01:13:44,928 --> 01:13:47,726
<i>- Benjamin Franklin.
- Benjamin Franklin.</i>

903
01:13:48,332 --> 01:13:50,425
Is this real?

904
01:13:50,501 --> 01:13:52,799
Just tell me what you told my friend.

905
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:56,601
Just a bunch of letters.
I can't remember.

906
01:13:56,674 --> 01:14:01,168
Can you remember which ones
you were gonna tell him next?

907
01:14:01,245 --> 01:14:04,009
Yeah, here. S-T-O-W.

908
01:14:12,022 --> 01:14:16,391
<i>Top results: Liberty Bell
and Independence Hall.</i>

909
01:14:19,763 --> 01:14:23,324
<i>Imagine its impact
back in the 18th century.</i>

910
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:27,496
It could have been seen for miles around,
which was exactly its purpose,

911
01:14:27,571 --> 01:14:29,596
because it served as a beacon, as it were,

912
01:14:29,673 --> 01:14:32,506
for people to collect and hear...

913
01:14:47,224 --> 01:14:48,213
Good stuff.

914
01:14:48,292 --> 01:14:51,887
<i>It was in 1846,
on George Washington's birthday,</i>

915
01:14:51,962 --> 01:14:55,090
that the final expansion
of the crack occurred,

916
01:14:55,165 --> 01:14:57,633
retiring the Liberty Bell permanently.

917
01:14:57,701 --> 01:14:59,896
Eventually, it was moved from its place

918
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:02,404
in Independence Hall steeple
and given its own...

919
01:15:02,473 --> 01:15:05,101
<i>- Idiot.
- Who?</i>

920
01:15:05,175 --> 01:15:06,699
- Me.
- What?

921
01:15:06,777 --> 01:15:09,837
It's not here. It's there.

922
01:15:10,714 --> 01:15:12,705
Come on.

923
01:15:21,191 --> 01:15:23,557
- What bell is this?
- It's the Centennial Bell.

924
01:15:23,627 --> 01:15:27,119
It replaced the Liberty Bell in 1876.

925
01:15:34,772 --> 01:15:36,831
<i>There it is.</i>

926
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:40,274
All right. I'm gonna go down there,
and you meet me in the signing room.

927
01:15:40,344 --> 01:15:42,710
- OK? All right.
- OK.

928
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:45,146
All right, let's go.

929
01:15:45,215 --> 01:15:48,548
3:22. My idea.

930
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:58,154
Hey. What'd you score?

931
01:16:58,222 --> 01:16:59,712
I found this.

932
01:16:59,790 --> 01:17:02,315
Some kind of ocular device.

933
01:17:02,392 --> 01:17:05,828
"The vision to see the treasured past. "
Let me take this.

934
01:17:05,896 --> 01:17:09,627
Aw, they're like early American
X- ray specs.

935
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:12,396
Benjamin Franklin invented
something like these.

936
01:17:12,469 --> 01:17:13,834
Uh...

937
01:17:13,904 --> 01:17:16,202
I think he invented these.

938
01:17:16,273 --> 01:17:18,298
So, what do we do with them?

939
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:20,935
We look through it.

940
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:26,816
<i>- Here, help me.
- Uh-huh.</i>

941
01:17:27,284 --> 01:17:29,912
<i>- Careful.
- You think?</i>

942
01:17:34,691 --> 01:17:35,919
Whoo...

943
01:17:35,993 --> 01:17:40,453
- What?
- It's just that the last time this was here

944
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:42,863
it was being signed.

945
01:17:45,469 --> 01:17:49,132
- Ben, there's another tour coming.
- Turn it over.

946
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:51,868
- Careful.
- Spectacles.

947
01:18:04,154 --> 01:18:06,122
What do you see?

948
01:18:08,959 --> 01:18:11,587
What is it? Is it a treasure map?

949
01:18:11,662 --> 01:18:16,599
It says, "Heere at the wall,"
spelled with two E's.

950
01:18:16,667 --> 01:18:18,658
Take a look.

951
01:18:19,503 --> 01:18:21,437
<i>Ah.</i>

952
01:18:22,673 --> 01:18:24,300
Wow.

953
01:18:24,374 --> 01:18:29,004
Why can't they just say, "Go to this place,
and here's the treasure, spend it wisely?"

954
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:31,513
<i>Oh, no.</i>

955
01:18:32,215 --> 01:18:34,615
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

956
01:18:35,619 --> 01:18:37,109
How'd they find us?

957
01:18:37,187 --> 01:18:40,748
Well, Ian has nearly unlimited resources.
And he's smart.

958
01:18:40,824 --> 01:18:43,486
<i>I don't think we can get out
of here without being spotted.</i>

959
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,495
Well, we don't want them to have
the Declaration, or the glasses.

960
01:18:46,563 --> 01:18:49,191
But we especially don't want them
to have them both together.

961
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:52,235
- So what do we do?
- We separate the lock from the key.

962
01:18:52,302 --> 01:18:54,361
- We're splitting up.
- Good idea.

963
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:55,598
Really?

964
01:18:55,672 --> 01:18:57,867
I'll take this.

965
01:18:57,941 --> 01:19:01,638
And those. You keep that. Meet me at the
car and call me if you have any problems.

966
01:19:01,712 --> 01:19:04,681
Like if we get caught and killed?

967
01:19:04,748 --> 01:19:08,309
Yeah. That would be a big problem.
Take care of her.

968
01:19:08,385 --> 01:19:10,717
- I will.
- I will.

969
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:21,025
We're on him.

970
01:19:23,567 --> 01:19:25,330
<i>There he is.</i>

971
01:19:29,439 --> 01:19:31,839
- Let's walk this way.
- Wait up.

972
01:19:32,576 --> 01:19:35,977
- Shaw, look. There's the others.
- I got it.

973
01:19:37,414 --> 01:19:42,511
Viktor, meet me at Fifth and Chestnut. Fifth
and Chestnut. They're heading your way.

974
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:09,270
<i>- Look out! Look out!
- Riley!</i>

975
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:12,281
<i>- There they are! Move!
- Move!</i>

976
01:20:13,116 --> 01:20:15,812
- Time to run.
- Keep up, Viktor! Move. Come on.

977
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:25,127
In here.

978
01:20:30,067 --> 01:20:32,262
- Come on.
- Follow me.

979
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,600
That way.

980
01:20:46,416 --> 01:20:49,681
If you're not a steak,
you don't belong here.

981
01:20:50,153 --> 01:20:53,452
<i>I'm just trying to hide
from my ex-husband.</i>

982
01:20:53,523 --> 01:20:56,321
- Who, baldy?
- Yes.

983
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,121
Honey, stay as long as you like.

984
01:20:59,196 --> 01:21:01,494
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

985
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:03,556
You want something?

986
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:12,269
- Do you want something?
- Shut up.

987
01:21:15,045 --> 01:21:17,104
I see why you left him.

988
01:21:22,652 --> 01:21:24,677
Go around. Go around.

989
01:21:30,327 --> 01:21:32,056
Gates!

990
01:21:56,119 --> 01:21:57,143
Ow!

991
01:21:58,021 --> 01:22:00,353
Aw, come on!

992
01:22:07,864 --> 01:22:09,798
<i>Shh-shh-shh.</i>

993
01:22:09,866 --> 01:22:12,357
- Where were you?
- Hiding.

994
01:22:12,435 --> 01:22:14,665
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

995
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:22,802
Ian. Ian, I've got 'em.
They're heading toward City Hall.

996
01:22:22,879 --> 01:22:25,507
- OK, I'm on my way.
- Out of the way!

997
01:22:25,582 --> 01:22:27,550
Ow!

998
01:22:53,643 --> 01:22:54,974
Whoa!

999
01:22:55,045 --> 01:22:56,774
They're headed for the breezeway
on the north side.

1000
01:22:56,847 --> 01:22:57,745
I'll be right there.

1001
01:23:07,224 --> 01:23:09,215
Hey, Gates!

1002
01:23:15,065 --> 01:23:18,466
Enough, man! Give me the document.

1003
01:23:19,569 --> 01:23:21,799
All right, Phil.

1004
01:23:38,622 --> 01:23:41,614
Watch out! Get out of my way!

1005
01:23:45,295 --> 01:23:47,160
<i>Watch it!</i>

1006
01:24:29,306 --> 01:24:31,501
Leave them! Let 'em go.

1007
01:24:34,511 --> 01:24:36,103
We've got it.

1008
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:40,747
<i>- FBI. Have you seen this guy?
- No.</i>

1009
01:24:41,584 --> 01:24:43,381
Nope, I haven't seen him.

1010
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:46,445
Ted. Philadelphia police
found Gates's car.

1011
01:24:46,523 --> 01:24:48,923
It's close.
We got surveillance there now.

1012
01:24:48,992 --> 01:24:51,756
Let's go. Tell the boss
we got the car.

1013
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:55,822
<i>- What?
- We lost it.</i>

1014
01:24:55,899 --> 01:24:59,562
<i>- What?
- We lost the Declaration. Ian took it.</i>

1015
01:25:01,738 --> 01:25:04,866
Yeah, uh, OK. You all right?
You both all right?

1016
01:25:04,941 --> 01:25:07,068
Yeah, yeah, we're all right.

1017
01:25:07,143 --> 01:25:10,374
<i>- Ben, I'm sorry.
- We'll be fine.</i>

1018
01:25:10,447 --> 01:25:12,938
Meet me at the car.

1019
01:25:18,855 --> 01:25:20,584
Suspect has arrived.

1020
01:25:24,094 --> 01:25:26,062
Hello, Mr. Gates.

1021
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:30,561
Mr. Gates, face your father's car and
put your hands behind your back, please.

1022
01:25:30,633 --> 01:25:34,194
<i>- We got one in custody.
- Gates, you're a hard man to find.</i>

1023
01:25:34,270 --> 01:25:35,862
Could you please be careful?

1024
01:25:50,153 --> 01:25:53,645
Riley, do you know
how to get in touch with Ian?

1025
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:57,557
Excuse me?

1026
01:26:02,032 --> 01:26:03,192
That's some story.

1027
01:26:03,266 --> 01:26:06,963
Well, it's the same story I tried to tell you
guys before the Declaration was stolen.

1028
01:26:07,037 --> 01:26:10,871
- By you.
- No, by Ian. I stole it to stop him.

1029
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:14,171
I did it alone.
Dr. Chase was not involved.

1030
01:26:14,778 --> 01:26:18,111
And Ian still ended up with
the Declaration of Independence.

1031
01:26:18,181 --> 01:26:20,206
Because of you.

1032
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:23,819
So here's your options.

1033
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:27,948
Door number one,
you go to prison for a very long time.

1034
01:26:28,458 --> 01:26:33,521
Door number two, we are going to get back
the Declaration of Independence,

1035
01:26:33,596 --> 01:26:38,397
you help us find it, and you still
go to prison for a very long time,

1036
01:26:38,468 --> 01:26:40,936
but you feel better inside.

1037
01:26:41,004 --> 01:26:44,405
Is there a door that doesn't lead to prison?

1038
01:26:45,175 --> 01:26:48,440
- Someone's got to go to prison, Ben.
- Yeah.

1039
01:26:50,847 --> 01:26:53,111
So what are these for?

1040
01:26:53,183 --> 01:26:55,174
It's a way to read the map.

1041
01:26:55,251 --> 01:26:56,980
Right.

1042
01:26:57,053 --> 01:26:58,611
Knights Templar.

1043
01:26:58,688 --> 01:27:00,121
Freemasons.

1044
01:27:00,190 --> 01:27:02,715
Invisible treasure map.

1045
01:27:03,293 --> 01:27:07,093
- So what'd it say?
- "Heere at the wall. "

1046
01:27:07,163 --> 01:27:09,688
Nothing else.

1047
01:27:09,766 --> 01:27:12,257
It's just another clue.

1048
01:27:12,335 --> 01:27:14,929
<i>It looks like Ian Howe
could be a false identity.</i>

1049
01:27:15,004 --> 01:27:17,666
<i>Follow up with ATF and INS.</i>

1050
01:27:18,241 --> 01:27:20,675
<i>There's more to it.</i>

1051
01:27:20,743 --> 01:27:23,268
- Standard tap procedure.
- Let's check the signal, folks.

1052
01:27:23,346 --> 01:27:25,678
- Lock it in.
- Are we set?

1053
01:27:25,748 --> 01:27:28,911
- Checking source.
- Unknown number.

1054
01:27:32,021 --> 01:27:33,283
Yes.

1055
01:27:33,356 --> 01:27:36,018
<i>Hello. Ben. How are you?</i>

1056
01:27:36,092 --> 01:27:39,550
<i>- Um, chained to a desk.
- Sorry to hear that.</i>

1057
01:27:40,063 --> 01:27:42,725
<i>I want you to meet me on the flight deck
of the USS Intrepid.</i>

1058
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:44,858
<i>- You know where that is?
- New York.</i>

1059
01:27:45,301 --> 01:27:47,360
<i>Meet me there at ten o'clock
tomorrow morning.</i>

1060
01:27:47,437 --> 01:27:50,929
And bring those glasses
you found at Independence Hall.

1061
01:27:51,007 --> 01:27:53,373
<i>Yeah. I know about the glasses.</i>

1062
01:27:54,344 --> 01:27:58,280
We can take a look at the Declaration,
and then you can be on your way.

1063
01:27:58,348 --> 01:28:00,145
And I'm supposed to believe that.

1064
01:28:00,216 --> 01:28:02,946
<i>I told you from the start.
I only wanted to borrow it.</i>

1065
01:28:03,419 --> 01:28:05,353
You can have it. And the glasses.

1066
01:28:05,421 --> 01:28:09,255
<i>I'll even throw in the pipe
from the Charlotte.</i>

1067
01:28:09,325 --> 01:28:11,054
I'll be there.

1068
01:28:11,127 --> 01:28:14,153
<i>And tell the FBI agents
listening in on this call</i>

1069
01:28:14,230 --> 01:28:18,166
<i>if they want the Declaration back.
And not just a box of confetti.</i>

1070
01:28:18,234 --> 01:28:20,634
Then you'll come alone.

1071
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:36,448
<i>- Take positions.
- Perimeter looks normal.</i>

1072
01:28:36,519 --> 01:28:39,886
<i>- Can I get a status report?
- Crow's nest in position. Port side is quiet.</i>

1073
01:28:39,956 --> 01:28:41,446
<i>Copy that.</i>

1074
01:28:51,568 --> 01:28:55,197
- Gates is on the flight deck.
- Eyes on Gates.

1075
01:28:55,271 --> 01:28:58,502
<i>- Do not lose sight of primary mark.
- Brian. You're clear with NYPD.</i>

1076
01:28:58,575 --> 01:29:01,100
- I have a visual.
- Gates.

1077
01:29:01,177 --> 01:29:02,439
<i>Stay with the program.</i>

1078
01:29:02,512 --> 01:29:05,811
I hope your agents are all under four feet
tall and wearing little scarves.

1079
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:07,816
Otherwise Ian's gonna know they're here.

1080
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:10,717
<i>As soon as he shows you the Declaration.
We'll move in.</i>

1081
01:29:10,787 --> 01:29:13,415
Don't try anything.
Just let us handle it.

1082
01:29:13,489 --> 01:29:17,619
You know, Agent Sadusky,
something I've noticed about fishing:

1083
01:29:17,694 --> 01:29:20,492
It never works out so well for the bait.

1084
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:31,973
Sir, we've got some traffic incoming.
Looks like a sightseeing helicopter.

1085
01:29:32,041 --> 01:29:34,407
Unit two,
get an eyeball on that chopper.

1086
01:29:34,477 --> 01:29:37,969
Agent Michaels, get FAA flight plans
and authorization records on that craft.

1087
01:29:38,047 --> 01:29:41,380
If that's not Mr. Howe,
I want to know who it is.

1088
01:29:41,451 --> 01:29:45,683
- I got him. He's coming from the north.
- Gates. Are you with me?

1089
01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:49,589
Well, I'm sure not against you,
if that's what you're asking.

1090
01:30:12,782 --> 01:30:15,216
We've got some interference
on Gates's mike, sir.

1091
01:30:15,285 --> 01:30:16,479
This I know.

1092
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:20,479
<i>Hello, Ben.</i>

1093
01:30:20,556 --> 01:30:24,048
Thomas Edison needed only one way
to make a light bulb.

1094
01:30:24,127 --> 01:30:26,527
Sound familiar?

1095
01:30:28,564 --> 01:30:30,759
<i>- Keep sightlines clear.
- What's the devil's going on?</i>

1096
01:30:30,833 --> 01:30:32,528
<i>There's a lot of commotion.
We can't see Gates.</i>

1097
01:30:32,602 --> 01:30:37,403
Go to the starboard observation point
behind the F-16 and here's what you do.

1098
01:30:38,908 --> 01:30:40,341
Gates? Gates?

1099
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:44,039
<i>Air Tour helicopter.
You are in controlled airspace.</i>

1100
01:30:44,113 --> 01:30:45,671
<i>Vacate immediately.</i>

1101
01:30:45,748 --> 01:30:47,340
<i>Who's got Gates?</i>

1102
01:30:47,417 --> 01:30:49,817
<i>- All agents. Report in.
- I can't see anything.</i>

1103
01:30:49,886 --> 01:30:53,185
<i>- Did Gates speak to anybody?
- Target is moving.</i>

1104
01:30:53,256 --> 01:30:57,249
<i>- He's heading towards the stern.
- I've got him. He's coming this way.</i>

1105
01:30:57,327 --> 01:30:59,420
Anyone got a view of our friend Ian Howe?

1106
01:30:59,495 --> 01:31:01,395
Ian Howe is not at the stern, sir.

1107
01:31:01,464 --> 01:31:04,729
<i>Then why is he heading there?</i>

1108
01:31:04,801 --> 01:31:07,964
<i>He's at the observation deck.</i>

1109
01:31:08,037 --> 01:31:09,095
Sadusky.

1110
01:31:09,539 --> 01:31:11,473
<i>I'm still not against you.</i>

1111
01:31:11,541 --> 01:31:15,409
But I found door number three.
And I'm taking it.

1112
01:31:15,478 --> 01:31:17,503
- What's he talking about?
- Move in!

1113
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:19,810
<i>Move in! Move in on Gates!</i>

1114
01:31:29,826 --> 01:31:30,884
<i>Divers are a go.</i>

1115
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,622
- Snipers, go to action zebra.
- All teams, move in. Pursue at own risk.

1116
01:31:33,696 --> 01:31:36,460
<i>- I repeat. Pursue at own risk.
- You first.</i>

1117
01:31:36,532 --> 01:31:39,160
Holy mackerel. He set us up.

1118
01:32:01,524 --> 01:32:05,290
<i>Agent Dawes. Do you have
a visual? Can you see Gates in the water?</i>

1119
01:32:05,361 --> 01:32:08,057
Sir, it's the Hudson. Nothing is visible.

1120
01:32:08,865 --> 01:32:10,856
Smart fish.

1121
01:32:29,318 --> 01:32:32,845
Hello, Ben. Welcome to New Jersey.

1122
01:32:33,890 --> 01:32:36,415
- What'd you do with Abigail and Riley?
- Hope these fit.

1123
01:32:36,492 --> 01:32:38,016
We had to guess your sizes.

1124
01:32:38,094 --> 01:32:40,153
I said, what'd you do
with Abigail and Riley?

1125
01:32:40,229 --> 01:32:42,459
He's the only one who could've
told you that line about Edison.

1126
01:32:42,532 --> 01:32:44,523
Did you bring the glasses?

1127
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,431
I don't know.
Tell me what's happening here.

1128
01:32:46,502 --> 01:32:49,130
Ask your girlfriend.

1129
01:32:49,205 --> 01:32:51,639
She's the one calling all the shots now.

1130
01:32:51,707 --> 01:32:54,471
She won't shut up.

1131
01:32:57,747 --> 01:33:00,238
Yeah, hello.

1132
01:33:00,316 --> 01:33:02,580
It's for you.

1133
01:33:03,052 --> 01:33:06,988
- Hello.
- Hi, sweetie. How's your day going?

1134
01:33:07,056 --> 01:33:09,149
<i>Uh. Interesting. Dear.</i>

1135
01:33:09,225 --> 01:33:11,693
So, what, you working with Ian now?

1136
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:16,322
It turns out helping someone escape
from FBI custody is a criminal act.

1137
01:33:16,399 --> 01:33:17,866
And he's the only criminal we knew.

1138
01:33:17,934 --> 01:33:20,903
<i>- So we called him and made a deal.
- Well, you're, um...</i>

1139
01:33:22,438 --> 01:33:25,100
You're... you're... you're all right, yeah?
I mean you're safe?

1140
01:33:25,174 --> 01:33:27,472
Yeah, we both are.

1141
01:33:27,543 --> 01:33:31,001
Riley's right here, doing
something clever with a computer.

1142
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:33,173
I'm tracking him through the... Hey!

1143
01:33:33,249 --> 01:33:35,649
I'm tracking you through the GPS
in Shaw's phone.

1144
01:33:35,718 --> 01:33:38,983
They take a turn anywhere we don't want,
we'll know it. So don't worry.

1145
01:33:39,055 --> 01:33:44,550
If Ian tries to double-cross us, we can call
the FBI and tell them right where you are.

1146
01:33:44,627 --> 01:33:47,425
<i>- And where to find Ian.
- And where is that?</i>

1147
01:33:47,497 --> 01:33:49,761
Right across the street
from where we're hiding,

1148
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:51,800
at the intersection
of Wall Street and Broadway.

1149
01:33:52,368 --> 01:33:54,768
Well, you figured out the clue.

1150
01:33:54,837 --> 01:33:58,068
<i>Simple. "Heere at the wall. "
Wall Street and Broadway.</i>

1151
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:03,437
Ben, there is a catch.

1152
01:34:03,513 --> 01:34:06,539
We made Ian believe
he could have the treasure.

1153
01:34:06,616 --> 01:34:08,607
It was the only way
we could get this far.

1154
01:34:08,684 --> 01:34:10,914
He's here.

1155
01:34:18,394 --> 01:34:20,385
<i>Here we go.</i>

1156
01:34:25,034 --> 01:34:26,058
Ben.

1157
01:34:26,135 --> 01:34:31,266
You all right? No broken bones?
A jump like that could kill a man.

1158
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:34,104
Naw, it was cool.
You should try it sometime.

1159
01:34:36,646 --> 01:34:40,446
The Declaration of Independence.
And the meerschaum pipe.

1160
01:34:40,983 --> 01:34:42,974
All yours.

1161
01:34:43,886 --> 01:34:47,322
- That's it?
- That's it.

1162
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:51,588
I knew you'd keep your promise.
Now, where is it? Where's my treasure?

1163
01:34:51,661 --> 01:34:53,458
It's right here.

1164
01:34:53,529 --> 01:34:56,760
The map said "Heere at the wall,"
spelled with two E's.

1165
01:34:56,832 --> 01:34:59,562
Wall Street follows the path
of an actual wall

1166
01:34:59,635 --> 01:35:02,763
that the original Dutch settlers built
as a defense to keep the British out.

1167
01:35:02,838 --> 01:35:07,366
The main gate was located at a street
called De Heere, also two E's.

1168
01:35:07,443 --> 01:35:10,105
Later De Heere Street was renamed
Broadway after the British got in.

1169
01:35:10,179 --> 01:35:12,739
So, "Heere at the wall. "

1170
01:35:12,815 --> 01:35:16,251
Broadway, Wall Street.

1171
01:35:16,319 --> 01:35:18,150
<i>Cheerio.</i>

1172
01:35:19,589 --> 01:35:21,284
Just a moment, Ben.

1173
01:35:21,357 --> 01:35:26,158
Ian, if you break our deal, the FBI
will be only a few minutes behind you.

1174
01:35:26,228 --> 01:35:29,095
You might get away, you might not.

1175
01:35:32,635 --> 01:35:34,830
Is that all the map said?

1176
01:35:36,839 --> 01:35:39,034
Every word.

1177
01:35:41,010 --> 01:35:43,308
Oh, Ben.

1178
01:35:43,379 --> 01:35:46,644
You know the key
to running a convincing bluff?

1179
01:35:46,716 --> 01:35:50,709
Every once in a while
you've got to be holding all the cards.

1180
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:03,054
Dad.

1181
01:36:05,601 --> 01:36:08,434
Is there anything else you want to tell me?

1182
01:36:12,508 --> 01:36:15,875
Trinity Church. We have to go
inside Trinity Church.

1183
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:21,579
Good. Excellent.

1184
01:36:21,651 --> 01:36:24,677
Well, why don't you ask Dr. Chase
and Riley to join us?

1185
01:36:24,754 --> 01:36:27,951
I'm sure they're around here somewhere.

1186
01:36:33,162 --> 01:36:35,653
Are you all right?

1187
01:36:35,731 --> 01:36:38,256
What do you think? I'm a hostage.

1188
01:36:39,769 --> 01:36:42,033
Sit. Sit down.

1189
01:36:42,104 --> 01:36:45,267
- Let him go, Ian.
- When we find the treasure.

1190
01:36:45,341 --> 01:36:49,675
No, now. Or you can figure out
the clues for yourself.

1191
01:36:49,745 --> 01:36:51,610
Good luck.

1192
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:53,114
Ben.

1193
01:36:53,182 --> 01:36:57,050
I don't think you fully appreciate
the gravity of the situation.

1194
01:37:05,494 --> 01:37:07,962
Let's have a look at that map.

1195
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:45,590
It's, uh...

1196
01:37:47,636 --> 01:37:50,298
It's... it's really quite something. It's, uh...

1197
01:37:50,372 --> 01:37:52,772
It really is remarkable. Take a look.

1198
01:37:59,315 --> 01:38:03,411
<i>- "Parkington Lane. "
- "Beneath Parkington Lane. "</i>

1199
01:38:03,486 --> 01:38:07,479
But why would the map lead us here,
then take us somewhere else?

1200
01:38:07,556 --> 01:38:10,047
<i>- What's the purpose?
- Just another clue.</i>

1201
01:38:10,126 --> 01:38:14,825
Dad. No, you're right. Parkington Lane
has to be here somewhere.

1202
01:38:15,965 --> 01:38:18,593
A street inside the church?

1203
01:38:18,667 --> 01:38:21,295
Not inside. Beneath.

1204
01:38:21,370 --> 01:38:23,361
Beneath the church.

1205
01:38:27,843 --> 01:38:30,368
- I'm so sorry, Ben.
- None of this is your fault.

1206
01:38:30,446 --> 01:38:31,538
- I co...
- Come on.

1207
01:38:41,257 --> 01:38:42,724
Look.

1208
01:38:44,126 --> 01:38:48,085
Cooperation only lasts as long
as the status quo is unchanged.

1209
01:38:48,164 --> 01:38:53,067
As soon as this guy gets to wherever this
thing ends, he won't need you anymore.

1210
01:38:53,135 --> 01:38:54,466
Or... or any of us.

1211
01:38:54,537 --> 01:38:58,371
So we find a way to make sure
the status quo changes in our favor.

1212
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:02,376
- How?
- I'm still working on it.

1213
01:39:02,444 --> 01:39:05,572
Well, I guess I better
work on it too, then.

1214
01:39:05,648 --> 01:39:08,344
Hey! Par... Hey, I found it!

1215
01:39:08,417 --> 01:39:10,214
- Him!
- Ben!

1216
01:39:10,753 --> 01:39:12,744
It's a name.

1217
01:39:15,624 --> 01:39:17,387
Parkington Lane.

1218
01:39:17,459 --> 01:39:21,156
He was a third-degree master mason
of the Blue Lo...

1219
01:39:21,230 --> 01:39:23,528
Hey! Stop!

1220
01:39:37,847 --> 01:39:39,371
Easy.

1221
01:39:40,683 --> 01:39:42,878
- Whoa!
- Oh!

1222
01:39:42,952 --> 01:39:45,011
Careful no one steps in him.

1223
01:39:45,087 --> 01:39:47,214
All right, put it down.

1224
01:39:54,129 --> 01:39:59,260
OK. Who wants to go down
the creepy tunnel inside the tomb first?

1225
01:40:00,236 --> 01:40:04,673
Right. McGregor, Viktor, you stay here.

1226
01:40:05,207 --> 01:40:10,509
And if anyone should come out without me,
well... use your imagination.

1227
01:40:13,415 --> 01:40:15,406
Shall we?

1228
01:40:33,168 --> 01:40:35,966
You got a light?

1229
01:40:52,588 --> 01:40:54,954
<i>Careful.</i>

1230
01:40:55,024 --> 01:40:57,322
Watch your step.

1231
01:41:03,098 --> 01:41:05,089
Come here.

1232
01:41:14,443 --> 01:41:16,843
Why does that never happen to me?

1233
01:41:22,885 --> 01:41:24,876
What's this?

1234
01:41:40,369 --> 01:41:42,360
It's a chandelier.

1235
01:41:51,547 --> 01:41:52,878
Here.

1236
01:42:08,831 --> 01:42:11,664
<i>- Wow.
- Look at the elevators.</i>

1237
01:42:11,734 --> 01:42:13,361
<i>A dumbwaiter system.</i>

1238
01:42:13,435 --> 01:42:16,029
How do a bunch of guys with hand tools
build all this?

1239
01:42:16,105 --> 01:42:19,734
Same way they built the pyramids
and the Great Wall of China.

1240
01:42:19,808 --> 01:42:22,902
Yeah. The aliens helped them.

1241
01:42:22,978 --> 01:42:25,242
Right, let's go. What are we waiting for?

1242
01:42:25,647 --> 01:42:29,777
I'm not going out on that thing.
200 years of termite damage and rot.

1243
01:42:29,852 --> 01:42:32,878
Dad, do what he says.

1244
01:42:52,207 --> 01:42:54,402
<i>Watch your step.</i>

1245
01:42:56,278 --> 01:42:58,212
We're right under the Trinity graveyard.

1246
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:00,908
That's probably why
no one ever found this.

1247
01:43:05,621 --> 01:43:07,612
What is that?

1248
01:43:12,027 --> 01:43:14,018
Subway.

1249
01:43:20,035 --> 01:43:22,265
Shaw! Oh, God, Shaw!

1250
01:43:32,948 --> 01:43:34,882
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1251
01:43:39,421 --> 01:43:42,015
Hold on! Hold on!

1252
01:43:44,526 --> 01:43:46,824
OK, get on the elevator. Jump!

1253
01:43:49,998 --> 01:43:52,228
<i>Ben! Grab my hand.</i>

1254
01:43:54,236 --> 01:43:55,828
- Come on.
- Ian!

1255
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:58,668
Abigail! Get on!

1256
01:44:02,444 --> 01:44:04,378
Jump!

1257
01:44:13,889 --> 01:44:14,981
Here.

1258
01:44:23,198 --> 01:44:24,859
Ben!

1259
01:44:25,634 --> 01:44:28,262
Get down there.
Get down there!

1260
01:44:33,675 --> 01:44:35,336
The Declaration.

1261
01:44:38,547 --> 01:44:40,742
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.

1262
01:44:54,897 --> 01:44:56,728
Oh, no! Ben!

1263
01:44:56,798 --> 01:44:58,288
Oh!

1264
01:45:02,938 --> 01:45:04,906
Hang on!

1265
01:45:13,649 --> 01:45:15,139
Son!

1266
01:45:22,191 --> 01:45:26,218
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I dropped you.
I had to save the Declaration.

1267
01:45:26,295 --> 01:45:30,857
No, don't be. I would have done
exactly the same thing to you.

1268
01:45:30,933 --> 01:45:33,094
Really?

1269
01:45:33,168 --> 01:45:36,763
I would have dropped you both.
Freaks.

1270
01:45:44,279 --> 01:45:46,509
Get on.

1271
01:45:46,582 --> 01:45:48,379
Ian...

1272
01:45:48,450 --> 01:45:50,884
it's not worth it.

1273
01:45:50,953 --> 01:45:55,617
Do you imagine any one of your lives
is more valuable to me than Shaw's?

1274
01:45:55,691 --> 01:45:56,988
We go on.

1275
01:45:58,794 --> 01:46:02,753
The status quo.
Keep the status quo.

1276
01:46:10,472 --> 01:46:13,771
<i>- Now what?
- This is...</i>

1277
01:46:13,842 --> 01:46:16,709
This is where it all leads.

1278
01:46:26,154 --> 01:46:28,145
OK, let's go.

1279
01:47:11,066 --> 01:47:13,626
What is this?

1280
01:47:13,702 --> 01:47:16,102
So where's the treasure?

1281
01:47:19,041 --> 01:47:20,406
Well?

1282
01:47:22,044 --> 01:47:24,308
This is it?

1283
01:47:24,379 --> 01:47:26,779
We came all this way
for a dead end?

1284
01:47:28,116 --> 01:47:29,515
Yes.

1285
01:47:32,754 --> 01:47:35,587
- There's gotta be something more.
- Riley, there's nothing more.

1286
01:47:35,657 --> 01:47:38,023
- Another clue, or...
- No, there are no more clues!

1287
01:47:38,093 --> 01:47:39,754
That's it, OK? It's over!

1288
01:47:39,828 --> 01:47:43,958
End of the road. The treasure's gone.
Moved. Taken somewhere else.

1289
01:47:45,267 --> 01:47:49,226
You're not playing games with me,
are you, Ben? Hm?

1290
01:47:49,304 --> 01:47:52,330
You know where it is.

1291
01:47:52,407 --> 01:47:54,102
No.

1292
01:47:57,813 --> 01:48:00,111
OK, go.

1293
01:48:00,182 --> 01:48:02,946
Hey, wait a minute.

1294
01:48:03,352 --> 01:48:05,616
<i>- Hey! Ian, wait!
- Wait, wait, wait!</i>

1295
01:48:05,687 --> 01:48:07,382
<i>- Ian...
- We'll be trapped.</i>

1296
01:48:07,456 --> 01:48:09,947
<i>- Don't do this.
- You can't just leave us here.</i>

1297
01:48:10,025 --> 01:48:13,961
Yes, I can.
Unless Ben tells me the next clue.

1298
01:48:14,029 --> 01:48:16,259
There isn't another clue.

1299
01:48:16,331 --> 01:48:20,791
Ian, why don't you come back down here
and we can talk through this together?

1300
01:48:20,869 --> 01:48:23,394
- Don't speak again.
- OK.

1301
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:28,936
The clue. Where's the treasure?

1302
01:48:30,045 --> 01:48:31,137
Ben?

1303
01:48:34,216 --> 01:48:36,275
- The lantern.
- Dad...

1304
01:48:37,719 --> 01:48:40,051
The status quo has changed, son.

1305
01:48:40,122 --> 01:48:41,680
Don't.

1306
01:48:44,726 --> 01:48:48,560
It's part of freemason teachings.

1307
01:48:48,630 --> 01:48:52,066
In King Solomon's temple
there was a winding staircase.

1308
01:48:52,134 --> 01:48:58,095
It signified the journey that had to be made
to find the light of truth.

1309
01:48:58,173 --> 01:49:02,041
- The lantern is the clue.
- And what does it mean?

1310
01:49:02,110 --> 01:49:04,635
Boston. It's Boston.

1311
01:49:04,713 --> 01:49:06,408
The Old North Church in Boston,

1312
01:49:06,481 --> 01:49:09,973
where Thomas Newton
hung a lantern in the steeple,

1313
01:49:10,051 --> 01:49:13,987
to signal Paul Revere that the British
were coming. One if by land, two if by sea.

1314
01:49:14,055 --> 01:49:19,288
One lantern. Under the winding staircase
of the steeple, that's where we have to look.

1315
01:49:19,361 --> 01:49:22,728
- Thank you.
- Hey, you have to take us with you.

1316
01:49:22,798 --> 01:49:25,995
Why? So you can escape in Boston?

1317
01:49:26,067 --> 01:49:29,662
Besides, with you out of the picture
there's less baggage to carry.

1318
01:49:29,738 --> 01:49:32,002
What if we lied?

1319
01:49:32,073 --> 01:49:33,335
Did you?

1320
01:49:33,408 --> 01:49:36,172
What if there's another clue?

1321
01:49:36,244 --> 01:49:38,405
Then I'll know right where to find you.

1322
01:49:40,148 --> 01:49:42,116
See you, Ben.

1323
01:49:44,619 --> 01:49:46,348
<i>- No!
- There's no other way out!</i>

1324
01:49:46,421 --> 01:49:48,480
<i>- Come back!
- You're gonna need us, Ian!</i>

1325
01:49:49,491 --> 01:49:51,891
We're all gonna die.

1326
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:55,987
It's gonna be OK, Riley.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1327
01:49:56,064 --> 01:49:58,191
It's OK, kiddo.

1328
01:49:58,266 --> 01:50:03,898
OK, boys, what's going on? The British
came by sea. It was two lanterns, not one.

1329
01:50:03,972 --> 01:50:07,169
Ian needed another clue,
so we gave it to him.

1330
01:50:07,242 --> 01:50:10,143
It was a fake.
It was a fake clue.

1331
01:50:10,212 --> 01:50:12,806
The all-seeing eye.

1332
01:50:12,881 --> 01:50:15,349
"Through the all-seeing eye. "

1333
01:50:16,117 --> 01:50:19,109
That means... by the time Ian
figures it out and comes back here,

1334
01:50:19,187 --> 01:50:22,918
we'll still be trapped,
and he'll shoot us then.

1335
01:50:23,425 --> 01:50:26,087
Either way, we're gonna die.

1336
01:50:26,928 --> 01:50:30,227
Nobody's gonna die.
There's another way out.

1337
01:50:30,799 --> 01:50:31,857
Where?

1338
01:50:31,933 --> 01:50:34,561
Through the treasure room.

1339
01:50:41,343 --> 01:50:43,334
Here.

1340
01:50:53,121 --> 01:50:54,884
Riley.

1341
01:51:21,483 --> 01:51:24,919
Looks like someone got here first.

1342
01:51:26,154 --> 01:51:28,714
I'm sorry, Ben.

1343
01:51:28,790 --> 01:51:30,621
It's gone.

1344
01:51:33,128 --> 01:51:35,824
- Listen, Ben...
- It may have even been gone

1345
01:51:35,897 --> 01:51:39,799
before Charles Carroll
told the story to Thomas Gates.

1346
01:51:41,002 --> 01:51:43,129
It doesn't matter.

1347
01:51:43,204 --> 01:51:46,173
I know. 'Cause you were right.

1348
01:51:46,241 --> 01:51:49,108
No, I wasn't right.

1349
01:51:49,177 --> 01:51:51,873
This room is real, Ben.

1350
01:51:51,947 --> 01:51:54,279
And that means the treasure is real.

1351
01:51:54,783 --> 01:51:57,616
We're in the company of
some of the most brilliant minds in history,

1352
01:51:57,686 --> 01:52:01,520
because you found
what they left behind for us to find

1353
01:52:01,590 --> 01:52:04,184
and understood the meaning of it.

1354
01:52:04,259 --> 01:52:07,194
You did it, Ben. For all of us.

1355
01:52:08,196 --> 01:52:11,495
Your grandfather, and all of us.

1356
01:52:11,967 --> 01:52:15,994
And I've never been so happy
to be proven wrong.

1357
01:52:26,348 --> 01:52:28,509
I just...

1358
01:52:28,583 --> 01:52:31,677
really thought
I was gonna find the treasure.

1359
01:52:33,622 --> 01:52:35,556
OK.

1360
01:52:35,624 --> 01:52:38,388
Then we just keep looking for it.

1361
01:52:41,663 --> 01:52:43,654
I'm in.

1362
01:52:48,370 --> 01:52:50,201
OK.

1363
01:52:51,806 --> 01:52:54,969
Not to be Johnny Rain Cloud here,
but that's not gonna happen.

1364
01:52:55,043 --> 01:52:58,376
Because as far as I can see,
we're still trapped down here.

1365
01:52:58,446 --> 01:53:00,937
<i>Yeah.</i>

1366
01:53:01,016 --> 01:53:02,916
<i>Now, Ben,
where is this other way out?</i>

1367
01:53:02,984 --> 01:53:05,077
Well, that's it.
It doesn't make any sense,

1368
01:53:05,153 --> 01:53:08,350
because the first thing the builders
would have done after getting down here

1369
01:53:08,423 --> 01:53:11,483
was cut a secondary shaft back out for air...

1370
01:53:11,559 --> 01:53:14,722
- Right.
... and in case of cave-ins.

1371
01:53:36,951 --> 01:53:40,045
Could it really be that simple?

1372
01:53:44,492 --> 01:53:46,722
"The secret lies with Charlotte. "

1373
01:55:14,682 --> 01:55:17,674
Scrolls from the library at Alexandria.

1374
01:55:19,788 --> 01:55:21,653
Could this be possible?

1375
01:55:41,176 --> 01:55:46,239
It's a big... bluish-green man,

1376
01:55:46,314 --> 01:55:49,181
with a strange-looking goatee.

1377
01:55:49,250 --> 01:55:52,048
I'm guessing that's significant.

1378
01:56:41,436 --> 01:56:42,425
Yes!

1379
01:56:54,249 --> 01:56:56,945
Riley, are you crying?

1380
01:56:57,018 --> 01:56:59,111
Look.

1381
01:56:59,187 --> 01:57:01,348
Stairs.

1382
01:57:17,672 --> 01:57:19,731
Hi.

1383
01:57:19,807 --> 01:57:21,798
Do you have a cell phone I could borrow?

1384
01:57:34,923 --> 01:57:37,915
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

1385
01:57:37,992 --> 01:57:41,325
You do know you just handed me
your biggest bargaining chip?

1386
01:57:41,396 --> 01:57:44,695
The Declaration of Independence
is not a bargaining chip.

1387
01:57:44,766 --> 01:57:46,495
Not to me.

1388
01:57:46,567 --> 01:57:48,296
Have a seat.

1389
01:57:48,736 --> 01:57:51,637
- So what's your offer?
- Oh...

1390
01:57:51,706 --> 01:57:54,641
How about a bribe? Say, uh...

1391
01:57:55,643 --> 01:57:58,942
ten billion dollars?

1392
01:57:59,013 --> 01:58:00,674
I take it you found the treasure?

1393
01:58:00,748 --> 01:58:03,342
It's about five stories
beneath your shoes.

1394
01:58:04,852 --> 01:58:07,082
Hm.

1395
01:58:07,155 --> 01:58:09,282
You know, the Templars
and the Freemasons believed

1396
01:58:09,357 --> 01:58:14,090
that the treasure was too great
for any one man to have, not even a king.

1397
01:58:14,162 --> 01:58:17,928
That's why they went to such lengths
to keep it hidden.

1398
01:58:17,999 --> 01:58:20,399
That's right.

1399
01:58:20,468 --> 01:58:24,029
The Founding Fathers believed
the same thing about government.

1400
01:58:24,105 --> 01:58:27,370
I figure their solution
will work for the treasure too.

1401
01:58:27,842 --> 01:58:28,934
Give it to the people.

1402
01:58:29,010 --> 01:58:34,107
Divide it amongst the Smithsonian,
the Louvre, the Cairo museum...

1403
01:58:34,182 --> 01:58:37,310
There's thousands of years
of world history down there.

1404
01:58:37,385 --> 01:58:41,822
And it belongs to the world,
and everybody in it.

1405
01:58:41,889 --> 01:58:45,620
You really don't understand
the concept of a bargaining chip.

1406
01:58:46,227 --> 01:58:50,891
OK, here's what I want.
Dr. Chase gets off completely clean,

1407
01:58:50,965 --> 01:58:53,058
not even a little Post-it
on her service record.

1408
01:58:53,134 --> 01:58:54,032
OK.

1409
01:58:54,102 --> 01:59:00,337
I want the credit for the find
to go to the entire Gates family,

1410
01:59:00,408 --> 01:59:03,206
with the assistance of Mr. Riley Poole.

1411
01:59:03,277 --> 01:59:05,609
And what about you?

1412
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:07,705
I'd really love not to go to prison.

1413
01:59:07,782 --> 01:59:12,742
I can't even begin to describe
how much I would love not to go to prison.

1414
01:59:13,988 --> 01:59:17,082
Someone's got to go to prison, Ben.

1415
01:59:17,158 --> 01:59:22,323
Well, if you've got a helicopter,
I think I can help with that.

1416
01:59:30,772 --> 01:59:33,104
<i>Freeze! FBI!</i>

1417
01:59:35,209 --> 01:59:37,473
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Show me your hands!

1418
01:59:39,313 --> 01:59:42,771
- Put your hands up.
- Move, move, move.

1419
01:59:46,421 --> 01:59:48,321
You're under arrest, Mr. Howe.

1420
01:59:48,389 --> 01:59:51,756
We've got you on kidnapping,
attempted murder...

1421
01:59:51,826 --> 01:59:54,818
and trespassing on government property.

1422
02:00:03,171 --> 02:00:06,004
Yeah. You got it, chief.
Thank you. Bye.

1423
02:00:07,141 --> 02:00:10,133
They want us in Cairo next week
for the opening of the exhibit.

1424
02:00:10,211 --> 02:00:12,111
They're sending a private jet.

1425
02:00:12,180 --> 02:00:13,442
That's fun.

1426
02:00:13,514 --> 02:00:17,348
Yeah, big whoop. We could have had
a whole fleet of private jets.

1427
02:00:17,418 --> 02:00:20,615
Ten percent, Ben. They offered you
ten percent and you turned it down.

1428
02:00:20,688 --> 02:00:24,146
Riley, we've been over this.
It was too much. I couldn't accept it.

1429
02:00:24,225 --> 02:00:28,389
I still have this splinter that's been festering
for three months from an old piece of wood.

1430
02:00:28,463 --> 02:00:29,521
OK, I'll tell you what.

1431
02:00:29,597 --> 02:00:33,431
Next time we find a treasure
that redefines history for all mankind,

1432
02:00:33,501 --> 02:00:35,492
you make the call on the finder's fee.

1433
02:00:35,570 --> 02:00:38,061
That's not as funny.

1434
02:00:38,139 --> 02:00:40,198
What do you care?
You got the girl.

1435
02:00:41,209 --> 02:00:42,904
- It's true.
- It's true.

1436
02:00:46,314 --> 02:00:48,441
Rub it in.
Enjoy your spoils...

1437
02:00:48,516 --> 02:00:51,007
while I sit on one percent.

1438
02:00:52,620 --> 02:00:55,521
One stinkin' percent.
Half of one percent, actually.

1439
02:00:56,023 --> 02:00:58,491
One percent. Unbelievable.

1440
02:00:58,559 --> 02:01:00,550
I'm sorry for your suffering, Riley.

1441
02:01:00,628 --> 02:01:04,997
For the record, Ben,
I like the house.

1442
02:01:05,066 --> 02:01:08,502
You know, I chose this estate
because in 1812 Charles Carroll met...

1443
02:01:08,569 --> 02:01:13,404
Yeah, someone that did something
in history and had fun. Great. Wonderful.

1444
02:01:13,474 --> 02:01:15,203
Could have had a bigger house.

1445
02:01:23,985 --> 02:01:27,716
- I made something for you.
- You did? What?

1446
02:01:27,788 --> 02:01:29,779
- A map.
- A map?

1447
02:01:31,259 --> 02:01:33,193
Where does it lead to?

1448
02:01:33,261 --> 02:01:36,196
You'll figure it out.

1449
02:01:45,261 --> 02:01:47,196
<u>THE END</u>

1450
