1
00:00:44,348 --> 00:00:47,628
People once believed
that when someone dies...

2
00:00:47,704 --> 00:00:51,828
a crow carries their soul
to the land of the dead.

3
00:00:51,905 --> 00:00:55,108
But sometimes,
something so bad happens...

4
00:00:55,185 --> 00:01:00,220
that a terrible sadness is carried
with it and the soul can't rest.

5
00:01:00,306 --> 00:01:03,222
Then sometimes,
just sometimes...

6
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:08,103
the crow can bring that soul back
to put the wrong things right.

7
00:01:49,428 --> 00:01:51,826
Over here.

8
00:01:51,902 --> 00:01:55,748
There's a piece of glass.

9
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:57,868
Hey, Sarge!

10
00:01:57,906 --> 00:02:00,064
Yeah?

11
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:04,466
Shelly Webster and Eric Draven.
Wedding was tomorrow night.

12
00:02:04,543 --> 00:02:07,659
Who the fuck gets married
on Halloween anyhow?

13
00:02:07,746 --> 00:02:09,587
Nobody.

14
00:02:11,102 --> 00:02:14,900
- Sir, we gotta move her.
- Do it.

15
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:17,144
All right, guys,
let's do it.

16
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:20,300
Devil's fucking Night.
What's the count so far?

17
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:21,700
143 fires.

18
00:02:21,748 --> 00:02:24,462
- They're slacking off from last year.
- Three hours to go.

19
00:02:24,548 --> 00:02:29,228
- Maybe they're just slow starters.
- Coming through!

20
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:35,261
You guys can't come in here
and take her away like this.

21
00:02:35,347 --> 00:02:39,941
There are procedures. You should have
cleared this with me first.

22
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,223
- Is this the victim?
- No, it's Amelia Earhart.

23
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:45,024
- We found her, and you missed it.
- I don't care what her name is.

24
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,584
I didn't give the order to move her.
Jesus, Albrecht.

25
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:50,979
I can see why they took away
your gold shield.

26
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:53,943
Yeah, I wasn't a big enough asshole.
Come on. Let's go.

27
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:55,861
All right, clear out.

28
00:02:57,184 --> 00:02:59,668
- Shelly?
- Stand back, kid.

29
00:03:01,826 --> 00:03:05,864
- Where's Eric?
- Just don't worry about him.

30
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,060
Tell him to take care
of Sarah.

31
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,906
Look, I will.
You just, uh, lie back. Come on.

32
00:03:21,506 --> 00:03:24,220
- You Sarah?
- Yeah.

33
00:03:24,306 --> 00:03:28,180
Yeah, look. Your sister,
she's gonna be okay.

34
00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:31,384
She's not my sister.
Shelly just takes care of me.

35
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:33,666
She's my friend.

36
00:03:33,743 --> 00:03:37,502
Her and Eric.

37
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,708
You lied to her about Eric.

38
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:41,300
I had to.

39
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:44,944
And you're lying
to me about Shelly.

40
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:47,265
She's gonna die,
isn't she?

41
00:03:47,304 --> 00:03:51,744
Hey, uh...

42
00:03:55,945 --> 00:04:01,421
Now, come on.
Come on. It's okay.

43
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:04,825
She's gonna be fine.

44
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:26,826
A building gets torch ed.
All that is left is ashes.

45
00:04:26,902 --> 00:04:29,664
I used to think that was true
about everything...

46
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:33,980
families, friends, feelings.

47
00:04:34,028 --> 00:04:37,826
But now I know that sometimes,
if love proves real...

48
00:04:37,864 --> 00:04:42,065
two people who are meant to be together,
nothing can keep them apart.

49
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:09,704
Later.

50
00:05:18,748 --> 00:05:21,827
What are you,
like the night watchman?

51
00:05:42,264 --> 00:05:45,505
You know, what this place
needs is a...

52
00:05:45,582 --> 00:05:47,826
good natural catastrophe.

53
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:52,142
- Earthquake, tornado, you know.
- No, no, no, no.

54
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,067
Mickey, come on, man. You got to put
the mustard underneath first.

55
00:05:55,144 --> 00:05:57,340
Maybe a flood like in the Bible.

56
00:05:57,426 --> 00:06:00,342
Hey, hey, let me do it.

57
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:04,303
There we go. All right.
How about some onions?

58
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:06,700
Come on, man.
Don't cheap out on me.

59
00:06:06,748 --> 00:06:08,628
- Lots of onions.
- All right, here you go.

60
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,987
Hey, all right.

61
00:06:11,064 --> 00:06:13,346
Now we're talking.

62
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:17,940
Hey, it's the Sarah monster.

63
00:06:18,026 --> 00:06:21,700
- How do you steer that on a wet street?
- Pure talent. Hi.

64
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:25,545
Now, Sarah, she's a genuine hot dogger.
You hungry?

65
00:06:25,622 --> 00:06:27,348
- You buying?
- I'm buying.

66
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:30,945
- No onions though, okay?
- No onions?

67
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:34,100
They make you fart big time.

68
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,779
You know, Lake Erie
actually caught on fire once...

69
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:45,388
from all the crap
floating around in it.

70
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,106
I wish I could have seen that.

71
00:07:47,946 --> 00:07:52,262
Fire it up! Yeah!

72
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:33,548
- All right, we busted their machines!
- Shit!

73
00:08:55,587 --> 00:08:58,819
Oh, oh, shit, guys.
T- bird, cop car, cop car.

74
00:09:05,782 --> 00:09:08,266
Bad people out
on the street tonight.

75
00:09:14,068 --> 00:09:15,900
- Damn it!
- What was that?

76
00:09:15,986 --> 00:09:18,547
- You wait right here.
- Be careful.

77
00:09:18,623 --> 00:09:21,788
Mickey, call it in for me!

78
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:42,060
Gabriel!

79
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:54,825
- Eric?
- Department of Housing!

80
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:59,227
Code violations?
Safety hazards?

81
00:10:59,303 --> 00:11:01,423
Place looks fine to me.

82
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:04,185
Let's redecorate.

83
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:10,582
"Abash, the devil stood...

84
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,219
and felt how awful
goodness is.

85
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:17,707
Saw virtue in her shape, how lovely. "
It's pornography.

86
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:22,502
Virtue?

87
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:25,427
Shelly?

88
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:30,261
- No! Eric!
- See ya!

89
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:32,946
No, no, no, me first.

90
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,061
Please.

91
00:11:38,624 --> 00:11:41,060
- Shelly.
- Eric!

92
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:21,579
- Hey, that's good.
- That's good.

93
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,743
See if you can top that, man.
Can you top that?

94
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,661
Look at that.
Look at that.

95
00:12:31,947 --> 00:12:36,224
Here's to Devil's Night,
my new favorite holiday.

96
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:41,662
You go over there
and talk to your pals...

97
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,702
You sick fuck.

98
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,308
Are you out of
your motherfucking mind, man?

99
00:12:51,425 --> 00:12:55,625
Look at that!

100
00:12:57,745 --> 00:12:59,701
Pussies drink last, man.

101
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,221
- Fuck you, Tin Tin.
- Hey.

102
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,980
Shit ain't
even loaded, man.

103
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:09,148
This one is.

104
00:13:09,224 --> 00:13:12,025
Which of you Motor City
motherfuckers...

105
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:16,225
wants to bet me
this one isn't?

106
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:20,023
Hey, fire it up!
Fire it up!

107
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,063
- Fire it up! - Fire
it up! - Fire it up!

108
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,825
Fire it up! Fire it up!

109
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:28,866
Here's your shooters.

110
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,822
- Put your guns away, huh, guys?
- How ya doing?

111
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:34,428
Pussycat.

112
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:57,100
Boo.

113
00:14:04,782 --> 00:14:08,148
- I love you.
- Say that again.

114
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:10,382
I love you.

115
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:13,499
Oh, boy.

116
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,865
Restaurant.

117
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:24,384
- Wow, you look great.
- Ta-da!

118
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:31,107
Yeah!

119
00:14:31,146 --> 00:14:33,620
- Come here!
- No, no, no!

120
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,186
Couple more rings.
That's 24k.

121
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:14,108
24k, huh? It's 18k.
It's crap. It's probably fake.

122
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:16,419
Leather purse. Leather.

123
00:16:16,506 --> 00:16:20,821
Geez. Oh, what is this, Tin Tin?

124
00:16:20,908 --> 00:16:25,262
A blood stain
that's on here?

125
00:16:25,348 --> 00:16:27,861
I'll give you 50 bucks.
And I hate charities.

126
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:30,661
Now, you,
take it or leave it.

127
00:16:30,747 --> 00:16:33,385
Right there for ya.

128
00:16:33,462 --> 00:16:37,662
Decisions, decisions.

129
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:42,179
You cheap ass, chrome dome...

130
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:45,143
... child molesting,
saprophyte motherfucker.

131
00:16:45,181 --> 00:16:47,464
Close the gate
when you go out!

132
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,101
Oh, I close this up
for you real good, massa.

133
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:52,585
Fuck you.

134
00:16:52,662 --> 00:16:55,941
Yeah, sit on it and twirl,
you dirty scum.

135
00:17:00,468 --> 00:17:04,745
Lucky I didn't stab
your fat ass.

136
00:18:45,502 --> 00:18:48,504
What the fuck you all painted
up for, crackhead, huh?

137
00:18:50,988 --> 00:18:55,064
Halloween ain't till manana.

138
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,741
Come on.

139
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:38,623
Fuck, you murderer!

140
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,222
I ain't murdered nobody, man!
I don't even fucking know you!

141
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:45,222
- Man, what the fuck you want, man?
- I want you to tell me a story.

142
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:48,588
A man and a woman
in a loft a year ago.

143
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:51,101
- You're out of your fucking mind...
- Listen!

144
00:19:51,187 --> 00:19:55,819
I'm sure you'll remember.
You killed them... on Halloween.

145
00:19:55,905 --> 00:20:00,662
Yeah, yeah, Halloween, yeah.
Some dude, some bitch, whatever, man.

146
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:03,060
Her name was Shelly.

147
00:20:03,146 --> 00:20:06,023
You cut her.
You raped her.

148
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:11,662
Shelly, yeah, yeah. I shanked
her pink ass and she loved it!

149
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:25,223
Murderer? Murderer? Let me tell you
about murder. It's fun!

150
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,740
It's easy.
You gonna learn all about it.

151
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:36,703
I'd like you to meet
two buddies of mine.

152
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,340
We never miss.

153
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:49,420
Try harder.

154
00:20:49,506 --> 00:20:51,501
- Try again!
- Aaah!

155
00:20:56,382 --> 00:21:01,024
Victims.
Aren't we all?

156
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:28,903
- Look at this mess! What's the world coming to?
- It's a mess.

157
00:21:35,981 --> 00:21:38,628
I got to go upstairs.
Report from the front.

158
00:21:43,184 --> 00:21:46,348
Get out of my way,
you worms!

159
00:21:47,422 --> 00:21:49,264
Give me some of that
over there!

160
00:21:51,422 --> 00:21:54,980
Why don't you ladies come by later?
Check me out.

161
00:21:55,028 --> 00:21:59,621
Hey, guess what?
Arcade Games fell down, went boom.

162
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,343
- Boom.
- Can you imagine that? It's tragic.

163
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:07,466
Gather your soldiers.
You're on for tomorrow night. No sweat.

164
00:22:07,505 --> 00:22:11,427
- Is the man in?
- He's taking a meeting.

165
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:43,862
You're thinking
about the past.

166
00:22:46,068 --> 00:22:48,465
Dad gave me this.

167
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:52,541
Fifth birthday.

168
00:22:52,628 --> 00:22:57,106
He said childhood's over
the moment you know you're gonna die.

169
00:23:10,427 --> 00:23:12,787
Is she asleep?

170
00:23:18,742 --> 00:23:20,900
I think we broke her.

171
00:23:24,746 --> 00:23:26,779
I love her eyes.

172
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:29,666
Pretty.

173
00:23:45,586 --> 00:23:48,626
Hey, kid,
get the hell outta the road!

174
00:24:06,464 --> 00:24:11,787
I told you to stay out of here.

175
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:15,345
So I guess you're not gonna be home
till a lot later, huh, Darla?

176
00:24:15,422 --> 00:24:19,306
She's busy. Go play with your dolls
or something, okay?

177
00:24:19,344 --> 00:24:21,588
I don't have any dolls.

178
00:24:21,665 --> 00:24:24,906
Get some food, huh?

179
00:24:24,945 --> 00:24:27,822
Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police.

180
00:24:33,308 --> 00:24:36,827
- "Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police. "

181
00:24:46,427 --> 00:24:49,544
Thirty, forty dollars.

182
00:24:51,222 --> 00:24:53,582
Who the fuck is this now?

183
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:57,619
Hey! Piss off!
We're closed!

184
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:00,266
Cerrado!

185
00:25:00,343 --> 00:25:04,026
Sleep it off somewhere else, dusthead,
unless you want to get mutilated.

186
00:25:11,305 --> 00:25:15,381
Goddamn creatures of the night,
they never learn.

187
00:25:17,021 --> 00:25:18,699
Hey! Hey!

188
00:25:22,746 --> 00:25:26,947
"Suddenly I heard
a tapping, as if someone...

189
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:30,783
gently rapping,
rapping at my chamber door. "

190
00:25:32,663 --> 00:25:34,868
What are you talking about?

191
00:25:34,945 --> 00:25:37,544
You heard me rapping, right?

192
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:41,582
You're trespassing,
and you owe me a fucking new door!

193
00:25:43,903 --> 00:25:46,741
I'm looking for something
in an engagement ring.

194
00:25:46,828 --> 00:25:48,142
Gold.

195
00:25:48,228 --> 00:25:50,462
You're looking for a coroner,
shit-for-brains.

196
00:25:54,548 --> 00:25:59,468
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit on me!

197
00:25:59,545 --> 00:26:01,980
Shit on me.
Shit on me!

198
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:10,027
- Aaah!
- Mr. Gideon.

199
00:26:10,104 --> 00:26:12,261
You're not paying attention.

200
00:26:15,062 --> 00:26:17,143
No!

201
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:22,303
I repeat, a gold
engagement ring, yes?

202
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:27,184
It was pawned here a year ago
by a customer of yours named Tin Tin.

203
00:26:29,783 --> 00:26:33,303
He confided in me
before he ran out of breath.

204
00:26:38,386 --> 00:26:40,304
Who's this sack of shit?

205
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,219
That's Tin Tin, one of
T- bird's little helpers.

206
00:26:43,305 --> 00:26:46,221
I think you can rule out
accidental death.

207
00:26:46,307 --> 00:26:48,983
Don't any of your street demons
have real grown-up names?

208
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:53,059
This could be a turf hit, but it doesn't
look like your usual gang crap.

209
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:57,662
Come on, Albrecht, spare me.
You're a beat cop now, so be a beat cop.

210
00:26:57,739 --> 00:26:59,580
I'm suppose to thank you
for that, right?

211
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:03,263
Word to the wise:
Watch your fucking mouth.

212
00:27:04,424 --> 00:27:06,744
What the hell
do you call that?

213
00:27:07,742 --> 00:27:10,226
I call it blood, detective.

214
00:27:10,302 --> 00:27:13,947
I suppose you'll write it up
as graffiti.

215
00:27:13,985 --> 00:27:16,661
You can leave
my crime scene now, okay?

216
00:27:23,106 --> 00:27:25,906
- Warmer?
- What are you doing?

217
00:27:25,983 --> 00:27:28,505
- Don't you know this game?
- What game?

218
00:27:28,543 --> 00:27:31,344
Okay, the rings!
I'll tell you about the rings!

219
00:27:31,421 --> 00:27:35,621
They're in that metal box!
It's under the shelf there!

220
00:27:35,707 --> 00:27:40,982
Take the fucking rings!
Choke on them, you son of a bitch!

221
00:27:44,425 --> 00:27:46,899
- Look, it goes to the attic.
- Okay.

222
00:27:55,703 --> 00:27:57,622
No, no.

223
00:27:57,708 --> 00:28:00,700
No, no, no.

224
00:28:03,107 --> 00:28:07,145
Oh, it's beautiful.
I don't believe it.

225
00:28:10,904 --> 00:28:13,187
Shelly.

226
00:28:21,022 --> 00:28:22,346
I love you.

227
00:28:30,066 --> 00:28:32,866
- You have one chance to live.
- Take anything you want.

228
00:28:32,943 --> 00:28:35,906
- Thank you.
- Take anything!

229
00:28:35,983 --> 00:28:38,707
Now you're going to tell me
where to find...

230
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,306
the rest of Tin Tin's
little party pals.

231
00:28:41,383 --> 00:28:43,665
The Pit. They all
hang out at The Pit.

232
00:28:43,742 --> 00:28:48,623
T- birds's little potato-heads hang out
there. Funboy lives there upstairs.

233
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,587
- Funboy.
- Oh, baby, oh.

234
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:55,260
- A whole jolly club...
- Please!

235
00:28:55,346 --> 00:28:57,983
- with jolly pirate nicknames!
- Stop! Please!

236
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,621
- Jesus Christ in a taxicab!
- Hold still!

237
00:29:02,222 --> 00:29:05,464
Each one of these is a life...

238
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:07,948
a life you helped destroy.

239
00:29:08,025 --> 00:29:10,547
I'm begging you.
Don't kill me.

240
00:29:10,585 --> 00:29:14,143
I'm not gonna kill you.

241
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,219
Your job will be to tell the rest
of them that death is coming for them...

242
00:29:18,267 --> 00:29:21,662
tonight.

243
00:29:26,505 --> 00:29:30,543
Tell them Eric Draven
sends his regards.

244
00:29:32,346 --> 00:29:36,268
You walk outta here,
they're gonna erase your sorry ass.

245
00:29:36,345 --> 00:29:39,826
You're nothing but street grease,
you motherfucker!

246
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,946
Is that gasoline I smell?

247
00:29:42,023 --> 00:29:44,861
No, man, no!
No!

248
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,904
No!

249
00:29:46,942 --> 00:29:48,228
No!

250
00:30:03,265 --> 00:30:06,584
It's on the house, kiddo,
you know that.

251
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,866
One root beer.

252
00:30:10,784 --> 00:30:13,422
I can't do anything.

253
00:30:13,508 --> 00:30:17,785
Your mom... technically,
she's off right now.

254
00:30:17,862 --> 00:30:19,905
Yeah, way off.

255
00:30:24,307 --> 00:30:29,025
Police! Don't move!
I said, "Don't move!"

256
00:30:29,064 --> 00:30:31,979
I thought the police
always said, "Freeze!"

257
00:30:32,065 --> 00:30:35,825
I am the police and I say don't move,
Snow White. You move, you're dead.

258
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:40,860
And I say I'm dead and I move.

259
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:44,101
Not one more step.
I'm serious.

260
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,340
Then shoot, if you will,
Officer Albrecht.

261
00:30:48,427 --> 00:30:51,428
What are you, nuts?
Walking into a gun?

262
00:30:51,505 --> 00:30:53,145
You high?

263
00:30:53,222 --> 00:30:56,262
- You don't remember me?
- What are you talking about?

264
00:30:56,348 --> 00:31:00,184
How about Shelly?
Do you remember Shelly Webster?

265
00:31:00,261 --> 00:31:02,822
Shelly Webster's dead, my friend.

266
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,300
I want you to move over to the curb,
nice and easy. Move it!

267
00:31:07,348 --> 00:31:11,981
Okay, we're gonna
wait here for backup.

268
00:31:12,067 --> 00:31:16,344
- It's getting too weird for me.
- Oh, it gets better.

269
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:18,742
Do you know someone named T-bird?

270
00:31:18,828 --> 00:31:23,221
He had a friend who shouldn't have
played with knives. Like the coat?

271
00:31:23,307 --> 00:31:25,781
You're the guy
that murdered Tin Tin.

272
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:29,224
- Check it out.
- He was already dead.

273
00:31:29,301 --> 00:31:34,422
- He died a year ago.
The moment he touched her.

274
00:31:34,508 --> 00:31:38,028
They're all dead.
They just don't know it yet.

275
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:40,426
Get away from there!

276
00:31:40,502 --> 00:31:43,504
Cops!
Get outta here!

277
00:31:43,543 --> 00:31:46,822
Leave it, run!

278
00:31:51,982 --> 00:31:56,144
Oh, great, great.

279
00:31:56,221 --> 00:31:58,705
Guy shows up looking like
a mime from hell...

280
00:31:58,782 --> 00:32:00,987
and you lose him
right out in the open.

281
00:32:01,064 --> 00:32:06,665
Well, at least he didn't do that walking
against the wind shit. I hate that.

282
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:10,501
Little early
for Devil's Night.

283
00:32:12,026 --> 00:32:14,625
You are very restless.

284
00:32:14,702 --> 00:32:17,780
Just wish I was a little
hungry again, that's all.

285
00:32:17,867 --> 00:32:21,943
- Be careful of what you ask for.
- Yeah, I may get it, I know.

286
00:32:32,943 --> 00:32:35,868
There are energies
aligning against you.

287
00:32:35,945 --> 00:32:38,304
Seeing is believing,
isn't it?

288
00:32:48,661 --> 00:32:51,548
Mmm, yummy.

289
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,467
Gideon's pawnshop just burned down
to the foundation.

290
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:03,622
Nobody cleared
this little event with me.

291
00:33:03,699 --> 00:33:05,387
I didn't have nothing
to do with that.

292
00:33:05,464 --> 00:33:08,024
You must be
awfully disappointed.

293
00:33:08,101 --> 00:33:11,304
I got trouble.
One of my crew got himself perished.

294
00:33:11,343 --> 00:33:13,548
- Yeah, who might that be?
- Tin Tin.

295
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:18,027
Somebody stuck his blades in all his
major organs in alphabetical order.

296
00:33:18,066 --> 00:33:20,540
Gentlemen, by all means,
I think we ought to have...

297
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:23,666
an introspective moment of silence
for poor, old Tin Tin.

298
00:33:26,227 --> 00:33:28,701
You're working for me
tomorrow night, right?

299
00:33:28,788 --> 00:33:31,463
- Whatever you say, I can do.
- Good.

300
00:33:31,502 --> 00:33:34,225
That's very reassuring.

301
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:38,148
I still ain't heard
why Gideon's burned down.

302
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:42,502
Is that a natural catastrophe
or act of God or something?

303
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:44,343
Call it my need to know.

304
00:34:16,586 --> 00:34:19,060
Let go, you creep!

305
00:34:22,264 --> 00:34:23,942
Nah.

306
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:27,184
You didn't even slow down,
you dickhead!

307
00:34:28,545 --> 00:34:30,828
He couldn't have stopped.

308
00:34:30,905 --> 00:34:35,019
He was a buttface.
I could have made it.

309
00:34:35,105 --> 00:34:38,021
What are you supposed to be,
a clown or something?

310
00:34:38,107 --> 00:34:40,025
Sometimes.

311
00:34:41,982 --> 00:34:46,547
It's more like surfing than skating.
I wish the rain would stop, just once.

312
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:51,025
- It can't rain all the time.
- Eric?

313
00:35:07,262 --> 00:35:11,664
Don't thank me.
Are we fighting the good fight?

314
00:35:11,741 --> 00:35:15,903
Double homicide a year ago.
No convictions.

315
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,259
Annie... look at that.

316
00:35:19,346 --> 00:35:23,383
"We, the undersigned tenants of
1929 Caulderon Court Apartments... "

317
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,426
What is this, a petition?

318
00:35:25,503 --> 00:35:28,265
Big "kick me" sign for a very nice girl
who found herself a cause.

319
00:35:28,342 --> 00:35:32,264
- The cause got her killed.
- She was fighting tenant eviction in that neighborhood?

320
00:35:32,341 --> 00:35:37,980
Shelly Webster and her nice
rock-and-roll boyfriend, Eric Draven.

321
00:35:38,066 --> 00:35:41,461
The last time you snooped around a case
is when you got put back on the beat.

322
00:35:41,548 --> 00:35:45,384
- I know. Torres keeps reminding me.
- I bet he does.

323
00:35:52,107 --> 00:35:55,703
You're going to wind up
working a school crosswalk.

324
00:35:55,741 --> 00:35:57,784
I'm cool.

325
00:35:57,861 --> 00:36:02,426
You didn't get that file from me, okay?
And don't tell me you owe me one.

326
00:36:02,464 --> 00:36:04,862
Ah, I owe you one!

327
00:36:04,948 --> 00:36:06,905
Yeah, right.

328
00:36:06,943 --> 00:36:09,024
Damn.

329
00:36:33,422 --> 00:36:37,143
Tomorrow night
we can get high...

330
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,739
and watch this whole fucking city
burn from that window.

331
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,142
- There's a big fucking bird over there.
- * No more **

332
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,108
Huh?

333
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,982
It's a squab.

334
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:15,581
Come here, bird.

335
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:17,663
Hey, bird.
Hey, bird.

336
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:19,983
Bird. B-B-Birdie.

337
00:37:20,022 --> 00:37:22,544
Here, birdie, birdie.

338
00:37:22,582 --> 00:37:25,460
Come here, birdie,
birdie, birdie.

339
00:37:27,982 --> 00:37:31,060
Birdie? Hey, birdie?

340
00:37:31,147 --> 00:37:33,621
Here, Funboy.

341
00:37:35,865 --> 00:37:37,745
What the fuck?

342
00:37:43,863 --> 00:37:48,227
No, man! Don't do that! You nearly
gave me a fucking heart attack!

343
00:37:48,304 --> 00:37:50,385
Look at him.

344
00:37:50,423 --> 00:37:53,185
Don't sweat it.

345
00:37:54,825 --> 00:37:57,741
It's time for you to take
your bird and leave, freako.

346
00:38:05,346 --> 00:38:09,988
Take your shot, Funboy.
You got me dead bang.

347
00:38:11,906 --> 00:38:16,624
You are seriously fucked up.
Did you look in the mirror?

348
00:38:16,701 --> 00:38:20,067
You need professional help.

349
00:38:21,784 --> 00:38:24,268
Bingo!

350
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:26,867
He shoots! He scores!

351
00:38:36,582 --> 00:38:40,140
- Jesus Christ!
- Jesus Christ?

352
00:38:40,226 --> 00:38:42,825
Stop me if you heard this one.

353
00:38:42,902 --> 00:38:45,702
Jesus Christ
walks into a hotel.

354
00:38:47,707 --> 00:38:49,423
Ow.

355
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,547
He hands the innkeeper
three nails and he asks...

356
00:38:53,624 --> 00:38:57,019
Don't you ever fucking die?

357
00:38:57,105 --> 00:38:59,263
"Can you put me up for the night?"

358
00:39:04,548 --> 00:39:08,940
- Does that hurt?
- Fuck. Does it... Fuck, does it hurt?

359
00:39:09,026 --> 00:39:10,983
Oh, God.

360
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:14,982
Look what you've done
to my sheets.

361
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:40,147
I've got a gun
in my pocket.

362
00:39:43,063 --> 00:39:45,662
You're happy to see me,
aren't you?

363
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:06,425
Stay away!
Stay away from me!

364
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:17,626
Look.

365
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:21,980
Mother is the name for God
on the lips and hearts of all children.

366
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:26,622
Do you understand?
Morphine is bad for you.

367
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:41,228
Your daughter is out there
on the streets waiting for you.

368
00:41:09,779 --> 00:41:13,308
If I wanted ice,
I would have asked for ice!

369
00:41:13,385 --> 00:41:15,543
Now fill it up!

370
00:41:16,588 --> 00:41:19,820
Fill it up yourself, macho man.

371
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:22,467
I really need this.

372
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:30,667
All right.

373
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:34,503
You burn yourself
playing with matches?

374
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:37,025
- Fuck off.
- You have an appointment.

375
00:41:37,102 --> 00:41:39,461
- Well, shit on me.
- Drink up.

376
00:41:39,548 --> 00:41:42,348
This is a first.
Do I bow or do I curtsy?

377
00:41:42,425 --> 00:41:45,100
Get my friend here
a glass of blood.

378
00:41:45,187 --> 00:41:48,467
Oh! Hey, hey, hon!

379
00:41:48,543 --> 00:41:51,344
Hey, good night, Darla.

380
00:41:53,665 --> 00:41:57,223
You stay put right there.

381
00:42:04,943 --> 00:42:08,261
Get away, steamhead.

382
00:42:26,742 --> 00:42:28,622
Shh.

383
00:42:38,145 --> 00:42:43,659
As you can see, I'm
on the corner of 27th and Washington...

384
00:42:43,707 --> 00:42:46,345
- the site of last year's biggest
Devil's Night conflagration.

385
00:42:46,421 --> 00:42:49,260
It was exactly one year ago
that the building you see...

386
00:42:49,346 --> 00:42:52,185
across the street from me
was totally demolished by fire.

387
00:42:52,224 --> 00:42:54,305
The fire that was fought
by seven fire companies...

388
00:42:54,381 --> 00:42:56,424
but lost the lives
of two fire fighters.

389
00:42:56,501 --> 00:43:01,066
In fact, if it weren't for the constant
surveillance by the local police...

390
00:43:01,143 --> 00:43:03,943
Freeze!

391
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,386
Jesus. Don't ever do that, man.

392
00:43:07,424 --> 00:43:09,342
Fuck.

393
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:13,303
Good likeness.

394
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,948
I saw your body, man.
You died. You got buried.

395
00:43:17,024 --> 00:43:19,182
You still have your hat on.

396
00:43:22,942 --> 00:43:24,946
I gotta sit down.

397
00:43:25,704 --> 00:43:27,583
Shi...

398
00:43:27,622 --> 00:43:30,384
Holy Shit.

399
00:43:31,784 --> 00:43:34,306
Say...

400
00:43:34,383 --> 00:43:38,507
are you some kind of... ghost?

401
00:43:38,584 --> 00:43:40,463
Boo!

402
00:43:47,742 --> 00:43:52,106
I don't know what I am. I need you
to tell me what happened to us.

403
00:43:54,024 --> 00:43:57,947
You took a six-story swan dive
out of a window.

404
00:43:58,023 --> 00:44:00,987
She, ah, was beaten and raped.

405
00:44:01,064 --> 00:44:05,465
Died at the hospital.
Hey, you asked, man.

406
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:08,064
Come on. Read the file.

407
00:44:08,141 --> 00:44:12,303
Shelly Webster held on
for 30 hours in intensive care.

408
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:15,468
Her body finally just gave it up.

409
00:44:15,507 --> 00:44:19,228
I saw it.
I couldn't do jack for her.

410
00:44:28,703 --> 00:44:30,544
- Hey.
- Don't touch me!

411
00:44:30,621 --> 00:44:34,467
Hey.

412
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:38,543
You okay?

413
00:44:38,581 --> 00:44:41,180
I saw her.

414
00:44:42,743 --> 00:44:45,908
I saw her
through your eyes.

415
00:44:45,985 --> 00:44:47,980
You stayed with her
the whole time.

416
00:44:48,066 --> 00:44:53,302
Yeah, well, you got to
understand something, all right?

417
00:44:53,379 --> 00:44:57,944
I was hoping
she'd come out of it, you know.

418
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,821
Give me something
I could work with.

419
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:03,027
Yeah.

420
00:45:03,065 --> 00:45:05,425
Look, I...

421
00:45:05,463 --> 00:45:07,861
Why didn't you do
something about it?

422
00:45:07,947 --> 00:45:11,141
You think any people in that building,
even the ones who signed the petition...

423
00:45:11,227 --> 00:45:14,545
would talk after
what happened to you?

424
00:45:14,622 --> 00:45:17,700
I kept asking
questions and...

425
00:45:17,787 --> 00:45:20,347
finally got busted for sticking
my nose where it wasn't wanted.

426
00:45:24,183 --> 00:45:26,063
This your wife?

427
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:30,427
Yeah, we, uh... Well, not anymore,
we're getting a divorce.

428
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:35,059
It's funny.

429
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:38,943
Little things used to mean
so much to Shelly.

430
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:42,386
I used to think
they were kind of trivial.

431
00:45:42,463 --> 00:45:45,340
Believe me,
nothing is trivial.

432
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:58,862
You shouldn't smoke these.
They'll kill you.

433
00:46:03,341 --> 00:46:06,420
You going to vanish
into thin air again?

434
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:12,500
I thought I'd use
your front door.

435
00:46:15,425 --> 00:46:21,026
Look, man, I'm sorry as hell for what
happened to you and your girlfriend.

436
00:46:22,503 --> 00:46:24,747
Yeah.

437
00:46:29,101 --> 00:46:31,585
Yeah.

438
00:46:31,662 --> 00:46:35,028
I got stabbed!
I shot the son of a bitch!

439
00:46:35,105 --> 00:46:38,106
I watched the bullet hole
close by itself.

440
00:46:38,183 --> 00:46:41,108
And then my business
gets blown up real good.

441
00:46:41,185 --> 00:46:44,302
- Other than that, my day sucked.
- Yeah.

442
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,786
I saw him too.
He had a guitar.

443
00:46:46,862 --> 00:46:51,101
He winked at me before he jumped out
a fourth-floor window like he had wings.

444
00:46:51,188 --> 00:46:55,983
He winked at ya?
Musicians.

445
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,428
- What else did you see?
- So far I haven't heard...

446
00:46:58,505 --> 00:47:00,903
shit about what you're going to do
about all this crap!

447
00:47:00,979 --> 00:47:06,264
What do I get? My livelihood
got flushed and went swirling.

448
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,987
You ain't lost everything.

449
00:47:09,064 --> 00:47:13,946
Yeah, and maybe you're not
such a big shot either! Ow! Jesus!

450
00:47:14,022 --> 00:47:17,465
Fair enough. Catch.

451
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:20,860
Aah! Jesus.

452
00:47:20,947 --> 00:47:23,267
Say hello to the last fellow
who wouldn't cooperate with me.

453
00:47:23,344 --> 00:47:25,262
What're you telling me,
this thing is real?

454
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:28,820
All the power in the world
resides in the eyes, fella.

455
00:47:28,907 --> 00:47:32,704
Sometimes they're more useful
than the people who bear them.

456
00:47:32,781 --> 00:47:36,742
You're directly out of
your fucking mind! You know that!

457
00:47:36,828 --> 00:47:39,379
Yeah.

458
00:47:39,427 --> 00:47:44,386
Eyes see. It's one of the most important
things I learned from my sister.

459
00:47:44,462 --> 00:47:47,579
Sister? She's supposed to be
your sister?

460
00:47:47,624 --> 00:47:50,818
My father's daughter.
That's right.

461
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:53,705
What's the matter,
you don't see the resemblance?

462
00:47:53,781 --> 00:47:55,939
Now, let's take it
from the top, friend.

463
00:47:56,025 --> 00:47:59,382
With a lot of detail.
What do you say?

464
00:47:59,507 --> 00:48:02,825
He had a bird with him.
Nearly pecked my face off.

465
00:48:02,902 --> 00:48:06,143
He told me to tell T-bird
that death was on its way.

466
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,387
Whatever the fuck that means.

467
00:48:08,426 --> 00:48:12,061
Draven. He said his name
was Eric Draven.

468
00:48:13,106 --> 00:48:15,101
Want to relax
that thing now?

469
00:48:15,139 --> 00:48:19,627
This bird man, he just happened
to let you live, huh?

470
00:48:19,704 --> 00:48:23,905
You sure you ain't making all this up
just to save your own ass?

471
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:26,542
I ain't making all this up.

472
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:30,944
I ain't twisted
like you two fucks.

473
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:34,704
All right.

474
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:43,987
A boy and his bird.
Awful touching.

475
00:48:44,064 --> 00:48:47,583
Yeah.

476
00:48:53,827 --> 00:48:56,704
For fuck's sake, die, will ya?
Give me that thing.

477
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,585
Thanks.

478
00:49:05,623 --> 00:49:07,819
Funboy said he saw
a black bird too.

479
00:49:07,905 --> 00:49:10,380
A big one.

480
00:49:10,466 --> 00:49:15,146
Then he choked to death
on his own blood.

481
00:49:15,223 --> 00:49:18,982
I'll have the janitor
come on up.

482
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:20,188
You again.

483
00:50:20,275 --> 00:50:22,548
You lost or hungry?

484
00:50:22,596 --> 00:50:25,310
Hi.

485
00:50:42,515 --> 00:50:45,114
I don't know how many times I
gotta tell you. We're in this together!

486
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:47,991
One part falls, it all falls!

487
00:50:48,068 --> 00:50:51,395
- You know how long it took us to put this together?
- Yeah, a long time.

488
00:50:51,434 --> 00:50:53,908
That piece of ratshit made Tin Tin
into a fucking voodoo doll!

489
00:50:53,994 --> 00:50:55,989
Tin Tin was a dick.

490
00:50:56,076 --> 00:50:58,914
Tin Tin.
Sheesh.

491
00:50:58,991 --> 00:51:03,029
Fire it up! Fire it up!
Fire it up! Fire it up!

492
00:51:03,115 --> 00:51:04,947
Fire it up!

493
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:09,435
No Funboy.

494
00:51:09,512 --> 00:51:13,271
Probably still...
banging away on Darla.

495
00:51:18,431 --> 00:51:21,394
Smokes and road beers.
Be quick.

496
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,389
I'm on it.

497
00:51:52,793 --> 00:51:56,227
What the fuck are
you supposed to be, man?

498
00:51:56,313 --> 00:52:00,753
I'm your passenger.

499
00:52:07,351 --> 00:52:09,433
Drive.

500
00:52:14,314 --> 00:52:16,031
What's all this
happy horseshit?

501
00:52:16,107 --> 00:52:18,150
Hey, T-bird! T-bird!

502
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:26,475
- Oh, shit!
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

503
00:52:26,551 --> 00:52:30,388
Stupid asshair!
You hit my car!

504
00:52:37,072 --> 00:52:41,311
What do you want, man?
Money? Drugs? I got it.

505
00:52:42,874 --> 00:52:45,627
We could use you.
You did Tin Tin.

506
00:52:45,713 --> 00:52:48,667
- This is business, right?
- Faster.

507
00:52:51,515 --> 00:52:55,553
You got that cream stuff?

508
00:52:55,591 --> 00:52:57,912
I hate this.
They can't even call it cream legally.

509
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:02,314
What in the crap...

510
00:53:05,671 --> 00:53:08,394
Oh, look. Making us popular.

511
00:53:08,433 --> 00:53:11,032
When they flash us like that,
they ain't friends.

512
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:19,231
This is Vehicle 48. We got us
a big, old, red hot rod.

513
00:53:21,667 --> 00:53:23,749
Turn.

514
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:27,671
You got something personal, amigo,
we can work it out.

515
00:53:27,748 --> 00:53:31,910
Right? Huh?

516
00:53:33,387 --> 00:53:35,794
Damn! Dead end!

517
00:53:40,954 --> 00:53:43,313
Look out!

518
00:53:46,507 --> 00:53:48,636
Oh, my God!
Get outta the way!

519
00:53:59,271 --> 00:54:03,347
Holy shit! Goddamn foreign cars!

520
00:54:06,867 --> 00:54:09,274
Shit! Shit!

521
00:54:16,112 --> 00:54:19,670
Oh, I hate this.
This ain't good.

522
00:54:21,032 --> 00:54:24,350
T- bird!
I got you, man!

523
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,710
Shit!

524
00:54:39,551 --> 00:54:41,747
Remember?
Yeah, I remember everything.

525
00:54:41,834 --> 00:54:44,950
But I don't know what...
What? Huh? What?

526
00:54:44,989 --> 00:54:47,674
What are you talking about?
No, no, no, no, no.

527
00:54:47,713 --> 00:54:50,714
You mean that place downtown?
Yeah, I remember her.

528
00:54:50,753 --> 00:54:52,834
We needed to put some fear
into that little lady.

529
00:54:52,911 --> 00:54:56,027
She wasn't going along
with our tenant relocation program.

530
00:54:56,114 --> 00:54:59,547
And her idiot boyfriend shows up
and turns a simple sweep-and-clear...

531
00:54:59,633 --> 00:55:02,913
into a total cluster fuck!
Who gives a shit?

532
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:06,107
It's ancient history!
Why? What do you want?

533
00:55:06,193 --> 00:55:10,912
What is it? What?
Speak to me. Speak!

534
00:55:12,427 --> 00:55:14,230
Did you send us
these complaints?

535
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:19,073
Come here!
"Abashed the devil stood. "

536
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:21,394
Does it get you sweaty?

537
00:55:21,471 --> 00:55:26,467
I know you. I know you.
I knew I knew you.

538
00:55:26,515 --> 00:55:30,428
I knew I knew you.
But you ain't you.

539
00:55:30,591 --> 00:55:34,351
You can't be you. We put you through
the window. There ain't no coming back.

540
00:55:34,427 --> 00:55:37,755
This is the really real world.
There ain't no coming back.

541
00:55:37,794 --> 00:55:40,067
We killed you dead.
There ain't no coming back.

542
00:55:40,153 --> 00:55:44,430
T- bird...

543
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:47,355
There ain't no coming back!
There ain't no coming back!

544
00:55:49,791 --> 00:55:53,790
T- bird.

545
00:55:53,867 --> 00:55:57,109
"Abashed the devil stood...

546
00:55:57,147 --> 00:55:59,995
and felt how awful goodness is. "

547
00:56:00,072 --> 00:56:02,834
"And felt how awful goodness is. "

548
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:18,793
T- bird. T-bird.

549
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:09,315
This is the 7:00 a. m. edition
of Action News.

550
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,636
For over a decade,
the night before Halloween...

551
00:57:11,674 --> 00:57:15,875
has had a darker and deadlier nickname
in the inner city, "Devil's Night"...

552
00:57:15,951 --> 00:57:19,231
the name given to what has become
an annual plague of arson.

553
00:57:19,308 --> 00:57:24,468
Last year over 200 blazes were reported,
and 11 people lost their lives.

554
00:57:24,516 --> 00:57:29,474
Tonight may become the biggest
and deadliest Devil's Night ever.

555
00:57:29,551 --> 00:57:33,032
The mayor has fire fighters
from all surrounding counties...

556
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:36,753
Do you like them up or over?
I can't remember.

557
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:41,308
What are you doing?
I don't even like eggs.

558
00:57:41,395 --> 00:57:46,113
- Wait, you loved eggs.
- Yeah, when I was five.

559
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:50,151
So what do you want now?
Black coffee and cigarettes?

560
00:57:50,227 --> 00:57:53,431
So what did you take
to become mother of the year?

561
00:57:53,469 --> 00:57:58,389
Oh, it wasn't drugs.
Someone kind of woke me up.

562
00:57:58,427 --> 00:58:03,990
- Who?
- Oh, it was nuts.

563
00:58:04,028 --> 00:58:09,073
You're acting weird. Did you win
the lottery or something, Darla?

564
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:15,594
Oh, forget it. I never was
too good at this mommy shit.

565
00:58:15,671 --> 00:58:17,790
Over easy.

566
00:58:19,795 --> 00:58:24,312
I like 'em
over easy... Mom.

567
00:58:34,468 --> 00:58:36,635
Hey, Albrecht.

568
00:58:39,273 --> 00:58:42,073
This is the third hit
in your hood in 24 hours.

569
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:45,267
We just fished this out of the river.
He's fused to his own car.

570
00:58:45,353 --> 00:58:49,391
- We're gonna have to I. D. his teeth.
- His name is T-bird.

571
00:58:49,467 --> 00:58:51,309
Arson was his specialty.

572
00:58:51,395 --> 00:58:53,275
Looks like he zigged
when he should have zagged.

573
00:58:53,351 --> 00:58:57,111
- Case closed.
- Bull-fuckin'- shit.

574
00:58:57,188 --> 00:58:59,355
Come here.

575
00:59:02,951 --> 00:59:04,831
You're holding out on me.

576
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:08,312
I got a goddamn vigilante killer
knocking off scumbags left and right...

577
00:59:08,389 --> 00:59:11,516
and you're covering up
for somebody.

578
00:59:11,592 --> 00:59:13,913
Who's the cartoon character
in the painted face?

579
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:17,711
- You're the detective. You tell me.
- Okay.

580
00:59:17,788 --> 00:59:19,831
Gideon's blows all to hell and you're
having a chitchat with some weirdo...

581
00:59:19,907 --> 00:59:22,669
who winds up in T-bird's car
when it zigs instead of zags.

582
00:59:22,708 --> 00:59:25,546
Then you steal one of
my case files from homicide...

583
00:59:25,633 --> 00:59:27,474
and you're saying this is
just a fucking automobile accident?

584
00:59:27,551 --> 00:59:29,747
- Come on!
- Yeah. Good speech though.

585
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:31,751
I didn't want to interrupt you.
It sounded good.

586
00:59:31,828 --> 00:59:33,746
You gotta write that shit down.

587
00:59:33,794 --> 00:59:35,674
All right, smart-ass.

588
00:59:35,712 --> 00:59:38,676
The captain's got a little
love note waiting for you.

589
00:59:38,714 --> 00:59:42,512
- Welcome to the first day of the rest of your suspension.
- Suspension?

590
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:46,147
- For what?
- Misconduct.

591
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:50,069
Yeah, give me the lab.

592
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,234
One for sorrow,
two for joy...

593
01:00:41,311 --> 01:00:44,034
- Come here.
- ... three for a girl, four for a boy.

594
01:00:48,868 --> 01:00:52,512
Dancing...

595
01:01:22,348 --> 01:01:24,228
Eric?

596
01:01:26,827 --> 01:01:30,950
Man, Sarah,
you're going crazy.

597
01:01:30,989 --> 01:01:33,828
Gabriel.

598
01:01:33,876 --> 01:01:36,551
I thought you were dead.

599
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:39,754
You're not dead, are you?

600
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:06,310
I knew it was you.

601
01:02:08,152 --> 01:02:10,952
Even with the makeup.

602
01:02:15,594 --> 01:02:18,068
I remembered your song.

603
01:02:18,154 --> 01:02:21,751
You said,
"Can't rain all the time. "

604
01:02:21,828 --> 01:02:24,954
That is from your song, right?

605
01:02:34,468 --> 01:02:37,469
Come on, Eric. I know you're here.

606
01:02:39,752 --> 01:02:43,674
I miss you...
and Shelly.

607
01:02:46,628 --> 01:02:49,947
Get so lonely
all by myself.

608
01:02:51,711 --> 01:02:56,152
The hell with you.
I thought you cared.

609
01:02:56,228 --> 01:02:59,230
Sarah, I do care.

610
01:03:09,991 --> 01:03:12,033
That's him.
That's him!

611
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:15,313
But he looked different. He was painted
up white like some kind of dead whore.

612
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:18,507
I seen him. T-bird sent me in
for some road beers, right?

613
01:03:18,593 --> 01:03:21,029
Then he took him away.
But I chased him down.

614
01:03:21,115 --> 01:03:23,791
And he flash fried T-bird
to his fucking car!

615
01:03:23,868 --> 01:03:27,234
Aw, T-bird!
Here's to you, buddy.

616
01:03:27,311 --> 01:03:31,070
Maybe we oughta just videotape this.
Play it back in slow motion.

617
01:03:32,355 --> 01:03:36,748
- Fire it up! Fire it up!
- You see the grave?

618
01:03:36,834 --> 01:03:39,308
- Empty.
- Fire it...

619
01:03:39,395 --> 01:03:41,226
Grave?
What grave?

620
01:03:41,313 --> 01:03:43,432
What about
my fucking grave?

621
01:03:43,509 --> 01:03:44,794
Three out of four.

622
01:03:44,871 --> 01:03:47,988
He's working his way back
to this speed freak right here.

623
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,587
It's not fair.
It's Funboy's fault.

624
01:03:50,673 --> 01:03:53,713
That boy was out of control.
T- bird, he came in, he says...

625
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:56,955
... "Waste them both. " And now
this ghost gonna kill my ass next!

626
01:04:00,829 --> 01:04:03,793
This ghost gonna
kill my ass next.

627
01:04:03,869 --> 01:04:07,475
- This ghost gonna kill...
- Hey.

628
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:09,432
That ain't no ghost.

629
01:04:11,273 --> 01:04:14,313
- They have all arrived.
- Watch him.

630
01:04:14,352 --> 01:04:16,270
We might need him.

631
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:20,068
Ghost gonna kill my...

632
01:04:32,267 --> 01:04:36,074
He like his plain
or with onions?

633
01:04:36,112 --> 01:04:39,431
Fine.
Don't talk to me.

634
01:04:39,469 --> 01:04:43,430
When someone's dead,
they can't come back, can they?

635
01:04:43,468 --> 01:04:45,990
That's what I thought.

636
01:04:46,029 --> 01:04:48,714
Are you referring
to anyone in particular?

637
01:04:48,752 --> 01:04:50,949
You'll just think
I'm nuts.

638
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:54,468
Yeah, well, then maybe
they'll have to lock us both up.

639
01:04:54,555 --> 01:04:59,666
- You see him too?
- I saw somebody.

640
01:04:59,753 --> 01:05:03,109
Maybe it was
your fairy godfather.

641
01:05:03,196 --> 01:05:05,986
Eric didn't come back for me.

642
01:05:06,073 --> 01:05:10,628
He can't be my friend anymore
because I'm alive.

643
01:05:10,714 --> 01:05:13,755
You want a friend
to walk you home?

644
01:06:44,029 --> 01:06:46,829
Boys.

645
01:06:46,906 --> 01:06:50,186
It seems our friend T-bird won't be
joining us this evening...

646
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:52,267
on account of
a slight case of death.

647
01:06:52,354 --> 01:06:54,233
You wanna sit down?

648
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:59,470
Well, well, well.

649
01:06:59,508 --> 01:07:02,471
Devil's Night is
upon us again.

650
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:04,390
I thought we'd throw
a little party...

651
01:07:04,428 --> 01:07:07,593
start a bunch of fires,
make a little profit.

652
01:07:07,631 --> 01:07:09,789
I like the pretty lights.

653
01:07:12,676 --> 01:07:16,435
Problem is, it's all been done before.
You see what I'm saying?

654
01:07:16,473 --> 01:07:21,470
- That's no reason to quit.
- Wrong. Best reason to quit.

655
01:07:21,547 --> 01:07:23,829
Only reason to quit.

656
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:29,190
A man has an idea.

657
01:07:29,267 --> 01:07:31,434
The idea attracts others...

658
01:07:31,511 --> 01:07:33,516
like-minded.

659
01:07:33,592 --> 01:07:35,587
The idea expands.

660
01:07:35,673 --> 01:07:39,155
The idea becomes
an institution.

661
01:07:39,231 --> 01:07:41,792
What was the idea?

662
01:07:41,869 --> 01:07:45,475
See, that's what's
been bothering me, boys.

663
01:07:45,552 --> 01:07:48,227
But I'll tell ya, when I used
to think about the idea itself...

664
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:51,267
it'd put a big old smile on my face.

665
01:07:51,354 --> 01:07:53,435
You see, gentlemen...

666
01:07:53,512 --> 01:07:58,307
greed is for amateurs.

667
01:07:58,393 --> 01:08:03,351
Disorder, chaos, anarchy...

668
01:08:03,428 --> 01:08:05,912
now that's fun!

669
01:08:05,989 --> 01:08:08,194
- What about Devil's Night?
- What about it?

670
01:08:08,271 --> 01:08:11,551
I started the first fires
in this goddamn city.

671
01:08:11,589 --> 01:08:14,553
Before I knew it, every charlatan
and shitheel was imitating me.

672
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:17,948
Do you know
what they got now?

673
01:08:17,986 --> 01:08:22,110
Devil's Night greeting cards.

674
01:08:22,148 --> 01:08:24,987
Isn't that precious?

675
01:08:25,035 --> 01:08:27,068
Yeah.

676
01:08:27,107 --> 01:08:31,710
The idea has become
the institution, boys.

677
01:08:31,748 --> 01:08:33,714
Time to move along.

678
01:08:33,791 --> 01:08:36,112
You don't want us to do
"Light My Fire" time for the whole city?

679
01:08:36,189 --> 01:08:38,586
No.

680
01:08:38,634 --> 01:08:41,147
No, I want you to set
a fire so goddamn big...

681
01:08:41,195 --> 01:08:44,187
the gods will notice us again.
That's what I'm saying.

682
01:08:44,235 --> 01:08:46,748
I want all of you boys to be able
to look me straight in the eye...

683
01:08:46,786 --> 01:08:51,073
one more time and say,
"Are we having fun or what?"

684
01:08:51,111 --> 01:08:53,154
- Hey, you! What's your name?
- Huh?

685
01:08:53,193 --> 01:08:55,072
Skank!
You don't feel that?

686
01:08:55,111 --> 01:08:58,314
- I feel like a little worm
on a big fucking hook.

687
01:08:58,352 --> 01:09:00,673
"I feel like a little worm
on a big fucking hook. "

688
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:04,950
Well, boy, your mama
must be damn proud of you!

689
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:09,832
How the hell did
that thing get in here?

690
01:09:11,194 --> 01:09:13,591
Gentlemen.

691
01:09:13,668 --> 01:09:18,108
Let me go!
Let me go! I gotta go!

692
01:09:22,472 --> 01:09:26,107
You're him, huh?
The avenger.

693
01:09:26,155 --> 01:09:28,552
The killer of killers.

694
01:09:28,629 --> 01:09:31,353
Nice outfit.

695
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:33,396
I'm not sure
about the face though.

696
01:09:33,472 --> 01:09:35,429
I just want him.

697
01:09:35,515 --> 01:09:38,795
Well, you can't have him.

698
01:09:38,872 --> 01:09:41,432
Well...

699
01:09:43,427 --> 01:09:45,786
I see you have
made your decision.

700
01:09:47,311 --> 01:09:49,191
Now let's see you enforce it.

701
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:52,787
Aw, this is already boring the shit
out of me. Kill him!

702
01:09:58,426 --> 01:10:02,196
Ooh, that had to hurt.

703
01:10:02,272 --> 01:10:04,948
Well, that's that.

704
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:08,074
That guy was crazy.

705
01:10:14,433 --> 01:10:16,150
He's gone.

706
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:25,510
Get him!

707
01:10:42,072 --> 01:10:44,748
Right here! Here, help me!
He's gonna kill me!

708
01:10:48,632 --> 01:10:50,550
Jesus Christ!

709
01:11:06,307 --> 01:11:08,187
Hey!

710
01:11:39,394 --> 01:11:41,629
You're all going to die.

711
01:11:56,034 --> 01:11:58,748
Get the fuck outta here!

712
01:12:33,072 --> 01:12:35,872
Guess it's not a good day
to be a bad guy, huh, Skank?

713
01:12:35,949 --> 01:12:39,027
I'm not Skank.
There's Skank right there.

714
01:12:39,114 --> 01:12:42,835
- Skank's dead.
- That's right.

715
01:12:42,911 --> 01:12:44,628
No!

716
01:12:49,068 --> 01:12:52,588
What in the crap...

717
01:12:53,873 --> 01:12:56,396
- Don't move!
- Hold it!

718
01:12:56,472 --> 01:12:59,752
That's all she wrote!
Move and we shoot!

719
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:11,232
You are surrounded by police units.
Do not attempt to escape.

720
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:18,031
- Stop running immediately.
- Holy shit!

721
01:13:18,108 --> 01:13:20,151
... arms and legs...

722
01:13:25,474 --> 01:13:30,067
Stop immediately.
Lie down, spread your arms and legs...

723
01:14:09,033 --> 01:14:13,474
Come on! Move it!

724
01:14:17,713 --> 01:14:20,714
My advice:
Next time duck.

725
01:14:22,671 --> 01:14:24,953
So many cops, you'd think
they were giving away donuts.

726
01:14:28,272 --> 01:14:31,273
Shit!

727
01:14:34,035 --> 01:14:36,826
Oh. I knew you
were gonna do that.

728
01:14:36,913 --> 01:14:39,272
Look at that out there.

729
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:42,149
The whole city oughta be
in flames by now.

730
01:14:42,187 --> 01:14:45,275
Sky oughta be red.

731
01:14:45,352 --> 01:14:49,514
So that, I take it,
is the late, great Eric Draven.

732
01:14:49,553 --> 01:14:55,029
He has power, but it is power
you can take from him.

733
01:14:55,115 --> 01:14:57,954
- I like him already.
- The crow...

734
01:14:58,031 --> 01:15:02,308
is his link between
the land of the living...

735
01:15:02,394 --> 01:15:04,629
and the realm of the dead.

736
01:15:04,715 --> 01:15:09,069
So, kill the crow
and destroy the man.

737
01:15:09,108 --> 01:15:11,035
Hmm.

738
01:15:33,189 --> 01:15:35,107
I'm coming home, Shelly.

739
01:16:22,186 --> 01:16:24,555
You're gonna say
I shouldn't be in the cemetery...

740
01:16:24,594 --> 01:16:26,588
in the middle
of the night, right?

741
01:16:26,627 --> 01:16:28,353
Safest place in the world to be.

742
01:16:28,391 --> 01:16:32,995
It's 'cause everybody's dead.
I knew you'd come here.

743
01:16:33,033 --> 01:16:37,032
It's really late, Sarah.

744
01:16:37,109 --> 01:16:39,746
You didn't say good-bye.

745
01:16:39,871 --> 01:16:43,669
You're just gonna have
to forgive me for that.

746
01:16:43,755 --> 01:16:47,831
And you're never coming back.

747
01:16:53,873 --> 01:16:56,990
I gave this to Shelly once.

748
01:17:00,548 --> 01:17:03,387
I think she'd like you
to have it.

749
01:17:07,271 --> 01:17:09,467
This way you'll
always remember her.

750
01:17:09,515 --> 01:17:11,989
I'll never take it off.

751
01:17:29,386 --> 01:17:33,069
I better go sneak
back in the house.

752
01:17:38,948 --> 01:17:40,828
Bye.

753
01:17:59,989 --> 01:18:02,713
Shh! Shh!

754
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:06,875
Shh. Take it easy, sweetheart.

755
01:18:13,512 --> 01:18:15,871
Come on.
Come on.

756
01:18:28,626 --> 01:18:32,587
What is that? Some sort of souvenir
there from your pal?

757
01:18:34,112 --> 01:18:37,114
I'll just keep it for good luck.
What do you say, hmm?

758
01:18:43,271 --> 01:18:46,436
Her eyes are so innocent.

759
01:18:57,311 --> 01:18:59,191
Eric!

760
01:18:59,229 --> 01:19:03,027
Eric, help! Eric!

761
01:19:40,871 --> 01:19:43,949
Quick impression for ya.

762
01:19:44,036 --> 01:19:47,594
Caw! Caw! Bang!
Fuck, I'm dead!

763
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:50,873
Give me the girl
and I'll let you walk out of here.

764
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:53,875
Well, well.

765
01:19:53,952 --> 01:19:57,548
Why don't you just give me a minute
to think about that, huh?

766
01:20:05,192 --> 01:20:07,388
Nah. Fuck it.

767
01:20:15,511 --> 01:20:17,554
Aw, fuck.

768
01:20:24,507 --> 01:20:28,871
Well, well, well. It does seem to me
that our little life has undergone...

769
01:20:28,947 --> 01:20:32,630
a rather significant change in the past
few minutes now. Wouldn't you agree?

770
01:20:36,792 --> 01:20:40,034
Well, for a ghost,
you bleed just fine.

771
01:20:43,429 --> 01:20:45,587
- It's still alive.
- Well, then kill it!

772
01:20:47,188 --> 01:20:49,308
Bye-bye, birdie.

773
01:21:32,551 --> 01:21:34,594
Ah, shit.

774
01:21:34,632 --> 01:21:36,675
Well, just came by
to pay my respects...

775
01:21:36,713 --> 01:21:38,670
and here you are
getting all shot up again.

776
01:21:38,746 --> 01:21:41,230
- They've taken Sarah.
- How many?

777
01:21:41,307 --> 01:21:43,235
Two more.

778
01:21:43,273 --> 01:21:45,191
I can handle it.
Don't worry.

779
01:21:45,268 --> 01:21:47,713
I'm not worried.
Look, here's the plan.

780
01:21:47,752 --> 01:21:50,427
You stay in front, and when they
run out of ammo, I'll arrest 'em.

781
01:21:50,475 --> 01:21:54,072
That sounds like a great plan.
There's just one problem.

782
01:21:56,594 --> 01:21:59,989
Oh, shit.
You're bleeding all over the place.

783
01:22:00,075 --> 01:22:02,032
I thought, you know,
you were invincible.

784
01:22:02,108 --> 01:22:05,427
I was.
I'm not anymore.

785
01:22:05,513 --> 01:22:09,551
Well, I guess you really will
need my help, won't you?

786
01:22:09,627 --> 01:22:12,428
Come on.

787
01:22:14,988 --> 01:22:16,954
You take that.

788
01:22:45,793 --> 01:22:49,111
- You were supposed to stay behind me.
- I think I messed up.

789
01:23:12,233 --> 01:23:15,350
This is all the power
you ever had.

790
01:23:15,389 --> 01:23:17,431
Now it is mine.

791
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:21,028
Pity there's not more time...

792
01:23:21,114 --> 01:23:23,627
... for us.

793
01:23:41,033 --> 01:23:43,748
Help, Eric!
I'm scared!

794
01:23:45,790 --> 01:23:48,226
Let me go!

795
01:23:56,954 --> 01:24:00,349
Let her go!

796
01:24:00,387 --> 01:24:03,187
You can have me.
I won't fight you.

797
01:24:03,187 --> 01:24:04,827
You can have me.
I won't fight you.

798
01:24:04,875 --> 01:24:06,793
All right.

799
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:08,826
No!

800
01:24:53,355 --> 01:24:54,755
Eric!

801
01:25:12,593 --> 01:25:15,787
- Sarah?
- Look out!

802
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:22,586
Eric!

803
01:25:30,268 --> 01:25:32,349
You know,
my daddy used to say...

804
01:25:32,436 --> 01:25:34,833
"Every man's got a devil...

805
01:25:34,910 --> 01:25:36,953
and you can't rest
till you find him. "

806
01:25:37,029 --> 01:25:39,475
What happened back there
with you and your girlfriend...

807
01:25:39,552 --> 01:25:42,352
I cleared that building.

808
01:25:42,429 --> 01:25:45,555
Hell, nothing in this town
happens without my say-so.

809
01:25:45,632 --> 01:25:48,356
So I'm sorry if I spoiled
your wedding plans, friend.

810
01:25:48,432 --> 01:25:51,146
But if it's any consolation
to you...

811
01:25:51,233 --> 01:25:54,714
you have put
a smile on my face.

812
01:25:54,791 --> 01:25:57,313
You got a lot
of spirit, son.

813
01:25:57,351 --> 01:25:59,874
I am going to miss you.

814
01:25:59,912 --> 01:26:02,348
I have something
to give you.

815
01:26:02,434 --> 01:26:04,707
I don't want it anymore.

816
01:26:09,033 --> 01:26:11,910
Thirty hours of pain!

817
01:26:14,154 --> 01:26:16,753
All at once!

818
01:26:16,830 --> 01:26:19,707
All for you.

819
01:26:44,268 --> 01:26:47,308
Yeah.

820
01:26:53,868 --> 01:26:56,591
Go help him.

821
01:26:59,795 --> 01:27:01,991
Are you alive?

822
01:27:03,909 --> 01:27:07,755
God, I need a cigarette.

823
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:15,350
Everybody else dead?

824
01:27:15,388 --> 01:27:17,594
You helped me.

825
01:27:17,671 --> 01:27:20,107
What you kept in here
saved me.

826
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:23,195
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

827
01:27:23,272 --> 01:27:26,149
I've been meaning
to come to church anyway.

828
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:33,591
Oh, yuck.

829
01:27:33,668 --> 01:27:38,473
I'm quitting as of now...
if I live.

830
01:27:46,596 --> 01:27:49,914
Stay with him
until help comes.

831
01:27:49,952 --> 01:27:53,271
He'll be okay, right?

832
01:27:53,347 --> 01:27:55,467
Eric?

833
01:27:56,867 --> 01:28:00,310
He does that a lot.

834
01:28:15,914 --> 01:28:18,273
Shelly.

835
01:28:29,992 --> 01:28:34,634
- All right, what's going on in there?
- Multiple homicides.

836
01:28:34,711 --> 01:28:37,310
At least it stopped raining, huh?

837
01:28:37,348 --> 01:28:40,628
- It can't rain all the time.
- No, I don't believe it.

838
01:28:40,714 --> 01:28:43,908
- This nightmare your fault, Albrecht?
- Look, you go on home.

839
01:28:43,946 --> 01:28:45,836
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

840
01:28:45,874 --> 01:28:50,266
- Want to tell me what's going on?
- Your vigilante's up on the roof.

841
01:28:50,353 --> 01:28:52,309
You missed it.

842
01:28:52,395 --> 01:28:54,946
Get him outta here!

843
01:29:56,507 --> 01:29:58,387
Thanks.

844
01:30:03,393 --> 01:30:06,309
If the people we love
are stolen from us...

845
01:30:06,395 --> 01:30:11,267
the way to have them live on
is to never stop loving them.

846
01:30:11,353 --> 01:30:16,992
Buildings burn, people die,
but real love is forever.
