- You see,

191
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:32,389
f or 40 years
we've been trying to...

192
00:16:32,557 --> 00:16:36,389
reverse an evil spell
that was placed on our goddess Diana.

193
00:16:36,557 --> 00:16:38,472
She was a beautiful virgin,

194
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,346
an entertainer by trade
but a great sorceress by design.

195
00:16:43,972 --> 00:16:47,471
lt was here in this very room
on her wedding night...

196
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:50,262
that a jealous rival
placed this curse on Diana.

197
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,262
Her husband was turned
into a pink fish,

198

while our dear goddess...

199
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:01,261

in her honeymoon bed.

200
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:05,677
This was Diana.

201
00:17:10,135 --> 00:17:13,134

Hate to tell you this,
but, uh,

209
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,671
I kinda doubt
she was a virgin.

210
00:17:55,838 --> 00:17:58,379
[Eva] She had lovers,
but she saved that for marriage.

211
00:17:58,546 --> 00:18:02,211
lf she doesn't get his goop
in ten minutes, I'm gonna go
in there and get it myself.

212
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:05,378
[Chuckles]
That'd be a first for you.

213
00:18:05,546 --> 00:18:07,503

214
00:18:09,711 --> 00:18:12,960

Nope.

223
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,957
Besides,

224
00:18:40,124 --> 00:18:42,831
it's against hotel policy.

225
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:44,956
I was warned.

226
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:48,290
"No sex with the clientele."

227
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:04,288

and everything.

231

Really? That's good.

232
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,744
Yes. A f ella doesn't like
too many surprises down there.

233
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,743

understanding of my f eminine powers.

01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:51,504
We just met her at the pool.
You seem to be acquainted.

1016
01:13:51,672 --> 01:13:54,129
Yeah, Theodore and I go
way back, don't we, Theodore?

1017
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:56,503
[Clears Throat]
Actually, the name's Ted, Angela.

1018
01:13:56,671 --> 01:14:00,503
I only let people with loaded guns
pointed at my head call me Theodore.

1019
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:03,419
The man sittin' in this chair
with the Jim Beam in his hand,

1020
01:14:03,587 --> 01:14:06,419
yellin' "Bellboy" at you
is Norman.

1021
01:14:06,587 --> 01:14:10,836
- Norman, say hello to Ted.

1022
01:14:11,002 --> 01:14:12,960
- What's up, Ted?
- What's up, sir?

1023
01:14:13,127 --> 01:14:16,960
And the sociable son of a bitch
in that room over there is Leo.

1024
01:14:17,126 --> 01:14:19,834
And the person on the other end of
the phone is his lovely wif e Ellen.

1025
01:14:20,001 --> 01:14:22,167
- Leo!
- What?

1026
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:24,500
- Say hello to Ted the bellboy.
- Hold on a second. What?

1027
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:28,625
- Say hello to Ted the bellboy.

1028
01:14:28,792 --> 01:14:32,666

Leo, Leo, Leo, L-Leo, L-Leo!

1029
01:14:32,834 --> 01:14:35,499
- Leo, that is Ted the bellboy.
- That's me.

1030
01:14:35,666 --> 01:14:38,332
The bellboy we called
about 20,25 minutes ago.

1031
01:14:38,499 --> 01:14:41,332
Oh, Ted the bellboy.
Well, my goodness.

1032
01:14:41,498 --> 01:14:44,622
- Glad you could make it, chum.
- Glad I could be here.

1033
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:47,664
- [All Chuckling]
- Ellen, what does punctuality
have to do with love?

1034
01:14:47,832 --> 01:14:50,622
- Which brings me to me.
- Could you explain that to me, please?

1035
01:14:50,789 --> 01:14:54,663
Chester Rush, Ted.
Pleased to meet ya.

1036
01:14:54,831 --> 01:14:57,663
- I'm pleased to meet you, sir.
- Oh, Chester.

1037
01:14:57,830 --> 01:15:00,245
Not "sir."
Chester.

1038
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:03,245
- Chester? Oh, Chester.
- [Chuckles]

1039
01:15:03,413 --> 01:15:06,162
Um, terribly sorry I haven't
seen the movie yet, sir, but--

1040
01:15:06,329 --> 01:15:08,327
No worries.
No worries at all.

1041
01:15:08,495 --> 01:15:10,327
Don't worry.
Don't be sorry about that.

1042
01:15:10,495 --> 01:15:13,244
You know, it's just, that's
why God invented video. No problem.

1043
01:15:13,412 --> 01:15:15,661
- You got a point, sir.
- But you know what?

1044
01:15:15,827 --> 01:15:18,826
A lot of people did see it. Whole lot
of motherfuckers saw that movie.

1045
01:15:18,994 --> 01:15:20,826
- Didn't they? Didn't they?
- A whole lot--

1046
01:15:20,994 --> 01:15:25,910
- Lot of motherfuckers
saw The Wacky Detective.

1047
01:15:27,076 --> 01:15:29,825
The Wacky Detective, sir.

1048
01:15:29,993 --> 01:15:32,159
- Who drank out of this bottle last?
- Uh?

1049
01:15:32,325 --> 01:15:34,449
I said, "Who drank out
of this bottle last?"

1050
01:15:34,617 --> 01:15:38,324
- What the fuck's wrong?
- lt's fuckin' flat, man.
That's what's fuckin' wrong.

1051
01:15:38,491 --> 01:15:42,490
Goddamn Cristal is fuckin' flat.
There ain't a goddamn bubble
left in the fuckin' bottle, man.

1052
01:15:42,658 --> 01:15:45,782
- Jesus Christ!
What the fuck is goin' on here?
- Chill out, man.

1053
01:15:45,949 --> 01:15:48,823
Who fuckin'-- Who-- Fuck--
Who didn't put the cork in the bottle?

1054
01:15:48,990 --> 01:15:51,281
All right? Somebody!
l didn't do this!

1055
01:15:51,448 --> 01:15:53,364
I was drinkin' out of
that other bottle there.

1056
01:15:53,532 --> 01:15:55,572
Somebody didn't put the fuckin' cork
in the bottle. Who didn't put it in?

1057
01:15:55,739 --> 01:15:57,613
- Chester, do you want me to open
another bottle of champ--
- Who didn't put it in?

1058
01:15:57,781 --> 01:15:59,655
Do you want me to open
another bottle of champagne?

1059
01:15:59,822 --> 01:16:01,655
No, don't you fuckin'
open another bottle!

01:16:06,488 --> 01:16:08,820
- Do you know how much this shit
costs? No! You don't.

1063
01:16:08,988 --> 01:16:10,987
No! You don't!
No! You don't!

'Cause it's fucking free, man. lt's just

- $72.1million.

1076
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:55,773
That's fucking asses

1077
01:16:55,940 --> 01:16:57,814
You know, it's not your f ault.
l mean, they hit you both barrels.

1078
01:16:57,982 --> 01:17:00,481
But you know, fuck, you know, I just
would like a little consideration.

1079
01:17:00,648 --> 01:17:03,438
And my new one,
The Dog Catcher,

1080
01:17:03,606 --> 01:17:05,980
which, by the way, is testing
right through the ceiling,

1081
01:17:06,106 --> 01:17:09,063
all right, is projected
to gross a hundred.

1082
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:13,521
- The Dog Catcher.
- The Dog Catcher, Chester.

1083
01:17:17,771 --> 01:17:20,395
- Oh, thank you, sir.
- That's the good stuff.

1084
01:17:20,562 --> 01:17:23,228
Now, take a look at some of
these goodies you brought us, okay?

1085
01:17:23,396 --> 01:17:27,770
- Um, f-f ar be it--
Far be it for me, uh, Chester--
- Uh-huh.

1086
01:17:27,936 --> 01:17:30,894
But I was just wondering if you could
tell me, what is all that stuff f or?

1087
01:17:31,061 --> 01:17:33,269
Hey, one thing at a time, man.
I'm not a frog, and you're not a bunny.

1088
01:17:33,435 --> 01:17:35,934
- So let's not jump ahead.
- Very good, sir.

1089
01:17:36,102 --> 01:17:38,559
Norman, Norman, Norman, come on,
come on. I think you might want
to look at some of this shit.

1090
01:17:38,727 --> 01:17:41,601
Hey, you damn skimpy.
All right, men.

1091
01:17:41,768 --> 01:17:44,183
[Ted Laughs]

1092
01:17:44,351 --> 01:17:47,350
All right, man.
Tell it.

1093
01:17:48,934 --> 01:17:51,642
A block of wood.

1094
01:17:51,808 --> 01:17:54,349
Continue.

1095
01:17:54,517 --> 01:17:56,974
- Three nails.
- Why three nails?

1096
01:17:57,142 --> 01:18:00,974
That's how many Peter Lorre
asked f or. Continue, Ted.

1097
01:18:01,141 --> 01:18:03,265
A ball of twine.

1098
01:18:03,432 --> 01:18:06,390
Well, that is definitely
a ball of twine. Continue!

1099
01:18:07,806 --> 01:18:10,347
- A bucket... of ice.
- [lce Clattering]

1100
01:18:10,515 --> 01:18:12,347
- You into it?
- I'm into it.

01:18:12,515 --> 01:18:14,472
All right.
Go on!

1102
01:18:17,347 --> 01:18:19,554

[Mumbles]

1104
01:18:23,346 --> 01:18:27,262
- A club sandwich.
- That is mine.

1105
01:18:27,429 --> 01:18:29,303
[Clears Throat]

1106
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:34,178
And... a hatchet!

1107
01:18:34,345 --> 01:18:39,427
"A hatchet as sharp as the devil
himself," is what I asked f or.

1108
01:18:39,594 --> 01:18:42,384
Well, sir-- Chester--
you be the judge.

1109
01:18:42,552 --> 01:18:45,968
No, no, no, no, no.
I'll be the judge.

1110
01:18:46,135 --> 01:18:48,384
- Careful, sir.
- What do you think?

1111
01:18:48,551 --> 01:18:51,383
lt's a sharp
motherfucker.

1112
01:18:51,551 --> 01:18:56,092
Forget the nails and the twine.
Bring all this other bullshit
over to the bar. Come on.

1113
01:18:56,258 --> 01:18:59,007
- Let's go. Pronto, man.
- You heard him, Ted. Go ahead.

1114
01:18:59,175 --> 01:19:02,091
- Right you are, sir.
- Norman? Yeah?

1115
01:19:02,258 --> 01:19:05,924
[Leo] Yes, it's my job.
Yes, it's my fucking job. You know that.

1116
01:19:06,091 --> 01:19:09,173
He wanted to stay out late. I can't--
l went to the Monkey Bar, all right?

1117
01:19:09,341 --> 01:19:11,673

1118
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,839
Hey! I'm not yellin'!
You're the one that's fuckin' yellin'!

Ellen, please don't hang up on
me. Please don't hang up on me.

1120
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:22,504
Goddamn it! I swear to fucking God,

You cock-fucking New York bitch.

1122
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:28,629
- [Norman] Yo, Leo?

1123
01:19:28,796 --> 01:19:32,087
- Another fucking Honeymooners

- Fuckin', fuckin' shit, man!

1124
01:19:32,254 --> 01:19:36,087
What the fuck is wrong-- What the fuck

1125
01:19:36,253 --> 01:19:39,794
I'm gonna take the fuckin' car. I'm

1126
01:19:39,962 --> 01:19:44,211
I am gonna fuckin' drag her

Benedict fuckin' Canyon, man!

1127
01:19:44,377 --> 01:19:48,126
- You're still married, man?
- Yeah. I don't fucking know anymore.

1130
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:56,250

- So I had a little
fuckin' too much to drink!

1131
01:19:56,418 --> 01:19:59,792
lt's fuckin' New Year's Eve. New Year's
Eve. I can't fuckin' drive home.

1132
01:19:59,959 --> 01:20:02,333
Okay, Ellen, I'm sorry.
I'm fuckin' sorry about that.

1133
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:05,958
What do you want me to do?
Get in a fuckin' car, and go run
over six or seven fuckin' kids?

1134
01:20:06,125 --> 01:20:08,249
That'd be real fuckin' nice.

1135
01:20:08,416 --> 01:20:12,332
Man, what the fuck is the matter
with this bitch? [Sighs]

1136
01:20:12,499 --> 01:20:15,290
Fuck!

What the fuck

1138
01:20:17,457 --> 01:20:19,289
Block of wood, bucket
of ice and a hatchet, sir.

1139
01:20:19,457 --> 01:20:22,081
Get the fuck outta here.
Chester, talk to me. Norman?

1140
01:20:22,248 --> 01:20:25,331
We now return you to
The Man From Rio already in progress.

1141
01:20:25,497 --> 01:20:27,330
Oh, my fucking dick

1142
01:20:27,497 --> 01:20:29,413
- Tell me, Norman,

[Norman] Fuck the

Just in case.
Hey, just in fucking case.

- I told you to dump her, didn't l?

1153
01:20:56,536 --> 01:20:58,785
We're gonna sit down,'cause
we ain't quite through yet.

1154
01:20:58,952 --> 01:21:02,617
Leo. Sit on this little red stool.
Sit down on this little red stool,

1155
01:21:02,785 --> 01:21:08,284

1156
01:21:08,451 --> 01:21:11,283

1157
01:21:11,451 --> 01:21:13,283
- Uh-huh.

1158
01:21:13,450 --> 01:21:15,407
- Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.
- Excusez-moi.

1159
01:21:15,575 --> 01:21:18,449
- I treat that bitch like a queen, man.
- Chester.

1160
01:21:18,616 --> 01:21:20,574
That shit don't help,
treating a woman like a queen.

1161
01:21:20,741 --> 01:21:24,865
- I'm fuckin' working.
- As long as you
don't break up the furniture,

1162
01:21:25,032 --> 01:21:26,989
I don't give a fuck
what you do.

1163
01:21:27,157 --> 01:21:28,989
- Took all your money.
Gonna take your kids and house.
- As f ar as I'm concerned,

1164
01:21:29,157 --> 01:21:32,031
go ahead, trash the place!

1165
01:21:32,198 --> 01:21:35,072
Oh, but, look, let me explain
what we're talkin' about.

1166
01:21:35,239 --> 01:21:37,613
Sir, sir, you don't have
to explain anything to me.

1167
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:42,404
Whatever constitutes a good
time, as f ar as you guys are
concerned, that's your business.

1168
01:21:42,572 --> 01:21:47,071
Well, no, it's your business too, Ted,
because we want you to take part.

1169
01:21:49,862 --> 01:21:53,528
- [Tooting]
- Take part in what, sir?

1170
01:21:53,696 --> 01:21:57,403
Chester, your way of breakin'
the news to him gently is
scarin' the fuck outta him.

1171
01:21:57,570 --> 01:21:59,402
- Think so?
- Just spit it out.

1172
01:21:59,570 --> 01:22:01,444
Okay, okay, here we go.
Okay.

1173
01:22:01,611 --> 01:22:04,235
Thing is, Ted,
first off,

1174
01:22:04,402 --> 01:22:07,109
there's nothing homosexual
about what we want you to do.

1175
01:22:07,277 --> 01:22:09,192
I mean, I was thinkin'
you might be thinkin'...

1176
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,442
that we want you to do somethin'
like weird sex thing,

1177
01:22:11,609 --> 01:22:14,025
you know, like, suck us off,
pee on us, shit like that.

1178
01:22:14,192 --> 01:22:16,233
Nothing, nothing could be
further from the truth.

1179
01:22:16,401 --> 01:22:18,900
- Can I just jump in here for a second?
- No. No.

1180
01:22:19,066 --> 01:22:21,857
My kind of way of telling him
is kind of going all around the world.

1181
01:22:22,025 --> 01:22:24,190
- But it's the journey that's worth it.
- Yeah, well, I see that.

1182
01:22:24,358 --> 01:22:27,190
But he's been here for 15
minutes and you have, you know,
talked about everything but--

1183
01:22:27,357 --> 01:22:30,231
- What do you care?
- Why don't you just shut
the fuck up, bitch?

1184
01:22:30,399 --> 01:22:32,398
- "Bitch"?
- Bitch!

1185
01:22:32,565 --> 01:22:35,064
Uh, excuse me, aren't you the one who's
being paid to suck his cock, cork boy?

1186
01:22:35,231 --> 01:22:38,938
- Whoa!
- Cork boy, man! Business card!

1187
01:22:39,106 --> 01:22:41,772
- I see a new business card.
- [Spoon Tapping Glass]

1188
01:22:41,939 --> 01:22:44,105
Excuse me, if it
please the court.

1189
01:22:44,272 --> 01:22:48,187
Allow me to present
our intentions to Theodore.

1190
01:22:48,355 --> 01:22:52,146
- I second the nomination.
- I move that nomination be closed!

1191
01:22:52,312 --> 01:22:54,145
- Thank you.
- The court is yours, Leo.

1192
01:22:54,312 --> 01:22:56,311
Thank you very much,
Chester.

1193
01:22:56,479 --> 01:23:01,103
- Ted, you ever seen any of them
old Alfred Hitchcock episodes?
- Yes, sir.

1194
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:05,269
You ever see the one called The Man From
Rio with Peter Lorre and Steve McQueen?

1195
01:23:05,436 --> 01:23:07,352
- Uh--
- Ah, if you saw it, you'd remember it.

1196
01:23:07,519 --> 01:23:09,726
lt's called The Man From Rio
with Peter Lorre, Steve McQueen.

1197
01:23:09,894 --> 01:23:13,018
Anyway, Peter Lorre makes
a bet with Steve McQueen...

1198
01:23:13,185 --> 01:23:16,434
that Steve McQueen can't light his
cigarette lighter ten times in a row.

1199
01:23:16,601 --> 01:23:19,267
Now, if Steve McQueen lights his
cigarette lighter ten times in a row,

1200
01:23:19,434 --> 01:23:21,267
he wins Peter Lorre's
new car.

1201
01:23:21,434 --> 01:23:25,267
But if he does not light his
cigarette lighter ten times in a row,

1202
01:23:25,433 --> 01:23:29,932
Peter Lorre gets to chop off
Steve McQueen's little pinky.

1203
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:34,182
Norman and Chester here
just made that same bet.

1204
01:23:34,349 --> 01:23:37,390
Norman has bet
his pinky...

1205
01:23:37,557 --> 01:23:41,556
that he can light his cigarette lighter
ten times in a row.

1206
01:23:41,723 --> 01:23:43,555
lf he does,

1207
01:23:43,723 --> 01:23:47,930
he wins Chester's
1964 Chevy Chevelle...

1208
01:23:48,098 --> 01:23:50,930
red, fuckin',
beautiful car.

1209
01:23:51,097 --> 01:23:56,013
lf he doesn't, chop off
his fuckin' pinky. What do you say?

1210
01:24:02,763 --> 01:24:04,595
You guys are drunk.

1211
01:24:04,762 --> 01:24:07,511
- Yes!
- Of course! Of course we're drunk!

1212
01:24:07,678 --> 01:24:09,511
Teddy, that's why we're here,
but that does not mean...

1213
01:24:09,678 --> 01:24:11,761
that we don't know what the fuck
we're talking about.

1214
01:24:11,928 --> 01:24:13,761
I'm gonna tell you what
the fuck I'm talkin' about.

1215
01:24:13,927 --> 01:24:16,093
I'm gonna tell you what the fuck
I'm talkin' about.

1216
01:24:16,261 --> 01:24:19,301
I drive a motherfucking Honda
that my sister sold me.

1217
01:24:19,469 --> 01:24:24,551
You hear what I'm saying? A little
white motherfuckin' Honda Civic!

1218
01:24:24,718 --> 01:24:26,842
You see this shit?

1219
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:29,050
- "Hollywood's hottest new star--
- That's me.

1220
01:24:29,217 --> 01:24:31,424
next to America's
hottest old car.

1221
01:24:31,592 --> 01:24:33,924
- That's the car I own.
- Are you listenin' to me? Are you?

1222
01:24:34,092 --> 01:24:38,216
Goddamn shit!
Are you listening to me?

1223
01:24:38,383 --> 01:24:40,465
Now you take a good long look
at that there machine...

1224
01:24:40,633 --> 01:24:43,132
that this motherfucker
over here's standin' next to.

1225
01:24:43,299 --> 01:24:48,048
That's a 1964 nigger-red,
ragtop Chevy Chevelle.

1226
01:24:48,215 --> 01:24:52,256
And I love that car more than
l love hips, lips or fingertips.

1227
01:24:52,423 --> 01:24:57,047
Cut to: We're sittin' here
celebratin', gettin' high,

1228
01:24:57,214 --> 01:24:59,421
- drinking champagne--
- Drinking Cristal.

1229
01:24:59,589 --> 01:25:01,838
When you're drinking champagne,
you're drinking champagne.

1230
01:25:02,005 --> 01:25:04,420
When you're drinking Cristal,
you say you're drinking Cristal.

1231
01:25:04,588 --> 01:25:07,670
Whatever that pissity-ass thing is,
we are drinking it, you know.

1232
01:25:07,838 --> 01:25:09,754
- And we are watching TV.
- [Murmurs]

1233
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,253
What, what? Hey, hey, hey.
When all of a sudden,

1234
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:16,169
[Tongue Clicks]
we flip on Steve McQueen, Peter
Lorre being fuckin' badasses.

1235
01:25:16,337 --> 01:25:18,169
- Badass!
- Badasses!

1236
01:25:18,336 --> 01:25:21,043
And I look over at this
funny-looking motherfucker over here,

1237
01:25:21,211 --> 01:25:25,002
and I say, "I'd do that
f or the Chevelle."

1238
01:25:25,169 --> 01:25:29,835
- I'm funny.
- And that's when Chester says--

1239
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:34,626
"Oh, really?"

1240
01:25:37,542 --> 01:25:40,874
Well, you guys wouldn't be doing
something this stupid unless
you were really fucking drunk.

1241
01:25:41,042 --> 01:25:42,958
We already told you
we were drunk, Ted.

1242
01:25:43,124 --> 01:25:44,998
That goes without
motherfucking saying.

1243
01:25:45,166 --> 01:25:47,915
'Cause if we wasn't drunk,
we'd probably chicken out.

1244
01:25:48,083 --> 01:25:50,582
When you're fucked up,
you don't lie.

1245
01:25:50,748 --> 01:25:52,831
Man, you tell
the fuckin' truth.

1246
01:25:52,998 --> 01:25:54,997
You want to know what
the fuckin' truth is?

1247
01:25:55,165 --> 01:25:57,831
The fuckin' truth is, my
lucky Zippo is gonna win me...

1248
01:25:57,998 --> 01:26:00,414
Chester's fucking car.

1249
01:26:00,581 --> 01:26:04,163
Which brings us to your part
in this little wager, Ted.

1250
01:26:04,331 --> 01:26:06,121
I don't have a part, sir.

1251
01:26:06,289 --> 01:26:09,996
[Norman, Chester Laughing]

1252
01:26:10,163 --> 01:26:12,745
That's it. Like my old granddaddy
used to always say,

1253
01:26:12,913 --> 01:26:14,829
"The less a man makes
declarative statements,

1254
01:26:14,996 --> 01:26:17,579
the less apt he is to look
f oolish in retrospect.

1255
01:26:17,745 --> 01:26:20,494
- That's quite brilliant, sir.
- Ah, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1256
01:26:20,662 --> 01:26:23,161
Thing is, there are some inherent
obstacles in this undertaking.

1257
01:26:23,328 --> 01:26:25,327
Aside from the obvious.

1258
01:26:25,494 --> 01:26:29,327
First of which is being
the f act that I'm not like
Peter Lorre on that TV show.

1259
01:26:29,494 --> 01:26:32,743
I'm not some sick fuck travelin'
the countryside collecting fingers.

1260
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:34,742
All right, you know,
we're all buddies here.

1261
01:26:34,910 --> 01:26:38,326
No one wants Norman to lose his finger.
We just want to chop it off.

1262
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:40,367
You know, if f ate doesn't
smile on old Norman,

1263
01:26:40,534 --> 01:26:43,158
we'll put that fucker on ice,
whisk it right to the hospital,

1264
01:26:43,326 --> 01:26:45,533
where in all likelihood they'll be able
to sew it right back on.

1265
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:47,825
Well, hopefully, sir.

1266
01:26:47,991 --> 01:26:50,615
Yeah, well, they sewed
that guy's dick back on. They
can sew Norman's pinky back on.

1267
01:26:50,783 --> 01:26:52,990
- Yeah, how hard can it be?
- Yeah, good point.

1268
01:26:53,158 --> 01:26:55,532
So, Norman, he's,
he's taken care of, you know.

1269
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:58,032
His interests
have been looked after.

1270
01:26:58,199 --> 01:27:01,823
My interests,
on the other hand, have not.

1271
01:27:01,990 --> 01:27:06,531
I am as emotionally attached to my car
as Norman is physically to his finger.

1272
01:27:06,698 --> 01:27:10,155
That's a very fuckin' piece of expensive
machinery I'm putting on this wager.

1273
01:27:10,323 --> 01:27:12,780
And, you know, if I lose, I lose.
That's fine. That's no problem.

1274
01:27:12,947 --> 01:27:16,196
I have no problem with that.
I'm a big boy. I knew exactly
what the hell I was doing.

1275
01:27:16,363 --> 01:27:20,446
But if I win,
l wanna win. All right?

1276
01:27:20,612 --> 01:27:24,861
lf Norman lights his cigarette lighter
ten times in a fuckin' row,

1277
01:27:25,029 --> 01:27:28,736
he's gonna have no emotional problems
whatsoever about taking my car keys.

1278
01:27:28,903 --> 01:27:33,652
- [Murmurs]
- But if I win,

1279
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:38,569
well, it's not inconceivable
that at the last minute...

1280
01:27:38,735 --> 01:27:41,609
maybe neither Leo or l...

1281
01:27:41,777 --> 01:27:45,068
will be able to...
wield the axe.

1282
01:27:45,234 --> 01:27:48,317
- A hatchet, sir.
- Wield the hatchet.

1283
01:27:48,484 --> 01:27:51,525
Which brings us
full circle to you, Ted.

1284
01:27:51,693 --> 01:27:55,442
- [Glass Clatters On Bar]
- Clear-eyed Ted. Sober Ted.

1285
01:27:55,608 --> 01:27:57,774
Complete-stranger Ted.

1286
01:27:57,942 --> 01:28:00,107
lmpartial Ted.

1287
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:04,524
Just-met-us-and-couldn't-
give-a-fuck-about-us Ted.

1288
01:28:04,691 --> 01:28:09,440
We want you
to be the dice man.

1289
01:28:11,648 --> 01:28:14,522
Hell of a night, huh, Ted?

1290
01:28:17,522 --> 01:28:19,479
I've got to get out of here.

1291
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,813
Money!

1292
01:28:26,646 --> 01:28:30,687
Ted, I got a $100 bill here
with your name on it,

1293
01:28:30,854 --> 01:28:33,645
whether you do
what we ask or not.

1294
01:28:33,812 --> 01:28:36,686
Just to sit back down in
that chair for one minute more.

1295
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:40,644
I am not gonna cut off
Norman's little pinky!

1296
01:28:40,812 --> 01:28:42,644
Well, maybe you will
and maybe you won't.

1297
01:28:42,811 --> 01:28:45,060
But that has nothin' to do
with this $100 bill in my hand.

1298
01:28:45,227 --> 01:28:48,435
ln f act, you can tell us all
to go fuck off and walk
right out that goddamn door.

1299
01:28:48,602 --> 01:28:50,560
But if you wait 60 seconds
bef ore you do it,

1300
01:28:50,726 --> 01:28:54,142
you're gonna be $100 richer.

1301
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:56,350
Ted, you're gonna do
whatever you wanna do.

1302
01:28:56,518 --> 01:28:59,934
All we're askin' is that you
indulge us for one minute more.

1303
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:02,724
My friend Chester here is willing
to pay you for that minute.

1304
01:29:02,892 --> 01:29:06,516
Ted, take the money.

1305
01:29:12,807 --> 01:29:15,556
Now, let me get this straight.

1306
01:29:15,723 --> 01:29:18,389
I sit on that stool, listen
to what you have to say for 60 seconds,

1307
01:29:18,556 --> 01:29:21,430
- and I get $100?
- [Chester] Correct.

1308
01:29:21,598 --> 01:29:24,805
And afterwards I can walk out
that door, no hard f eelings?

1309
01:29:24,972 --> 01:29:26,929
None whatsoever.

1310
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:31,263
You got a deal.

1311
01:29:31,429 --> 01:29:34,803
- Yes!
- Oh, yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes,!

1312
01:29:34,971 --> 01:29:36,803
Ted, good answer.
Sit right down.

1313
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:40,803
All right. Leo,
you be the timekeeper.

1314
01:29:40,970 --> 01:29:43,802
Norman, give me
your watch.

1315
01:29:43,970 --> 01:29:48,636
Let me know when a minute ends
and when it begins.

1316
01:29:48,802 --> 01:29:50,760
- You got it.
- Ah.

1317
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:53,385
- Okay.
- Gentlemen, start your engines.

1318
01:30:00,843 --> 01:30:03,175
- Begin.
- Okay, Ted, pay attention here.

1319
01:30:03,343 --> 01:30:06,009
I'm gonna make two piles here
on the bar. One pile which is yours.

1320
01:30:06,175 --> 01:30:08,508
And another pile
which could be yours.

1321
01:30:08,675 --> 01:30:11,174
And what you have to realize
is we're gonna do this thing...

1322
01:30:11,342 --> 01:30:15,258
one way or the other.

1323
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:19,382
Whether it's you who holds
the axe or a Mexican maid...

1324
01:30:19,549 --> 01:30:22,257
or some bum
we yank off the street.

1325
01:30:22,423 --> 01:30:25,214
- You can buy a whole lot
of soup with that pile.
- Shh! I'm the closer here.

1326
01:30:25,382 --> 01:30:27,589
All right. I'm a little me--
Um, I've lost count.

1327
01:30:27,757 --> 01:30:29,881
- How much is on the bar here?
- [Group] Six hundred.

1328
01:30:30,047 --> 01:30:35,046
Okay. Ted, do you know how long it takes
the average American to count to 600?

1329
01:30:35,214 --> 01:30:39,255
- [Angela]
lt's a rhetorical question, Ted.
- No, sir.

1330
01:30:39,421 --> 01:30:42,587
About one minute less than
it takes to count to 700.

1331
01:30:42,755 --> 01:30:46,129
Now, Ted, a person's lif e is filled
with a zillion little experiences.

1332
01:30:46,295 --> 01:30:49,753
Some which are insignificant, have no
meaning, and, you know, you f orget them.

1333
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:54,128
Others which you remember f or
the rest of your natural lif e.

1334
01:30:54,294 --> 01:30:58,918
Now, since what we're proposing
here is so unusual,

1335
01:30:59,086 --> 01:31:02,085
so outside the norm,

1336
01:31:02,252 --> 01:31:06,417
that this is a good bet
that this is going to be one
of those incidents that sticks.

1337
01:31:06,585 --> 01:31:10,417
So, since you're gonna be
stuck remembering this
f or the rest of your lif e,

1338
01:31:10,584 --> 01:31:13,791
you have to decide
what that memory will be.

1339
01:31:13,959 --> 01:31:17,291
So, Ted, are you going to
remember for the next 40 years,

1340
01:31:17,458 --> 01:31:19,374
give or take a decade,

1341
01:31:19,541 --> 01:31:23,749
that you refused $1,000
f or one second's worth of work?

1342
01:31:23,916 --> 01:31:29,332
Or that you made $1,000
f or one second's worth of work?

1343
01:31:29,499 --> 01:31:31,331
[Leo]
Time!

1344
01:31:31,499 --> 01:31:34,789
So, Ted, what's it gonna be?

1345
01:31:34,956 --> 01:31:37,538
- Okay.
- [Group] Yes!

1346
01:31:37,706 --> 01:31:39,705
[Chester, Leo]
Always be closing!

1347
01:31:39,873 --> 01:31:42,747
- Whoo!
- Right here, right now!
Bef ore I change my mind!

1348
01:31:42,913 --> 01:31:45,454
Hear, hear.
Go. Let's go.

1349
01:31:45,622 --> 01:31:49,162
- Get this shit over and done with.
- Ahh!

1350
01:31:49,330 --> 01:31:52,496
Perf ect, perf ect, perf ect. This is
one of those moments in time...

1351
01:31:52,662 --> 01:31:55,786
none of us are
ever gonna f orget.

1352
01:31:55,954 --> 01:31:59,036
- Norman, are you ready?
- I'm ready.

1353
01:31:59,203 --> 01:32:02,869
- Ted, are you ready?
- Ready.

1354
01:32:03,036 --> 01:32:06,035
Okeydokey.
Norman...

1355
01:32:07,202 --> 01:32:09,159
begin.

1356
01:32:09,744 --> 01:32:12,909
Aaah!

1357
01:32:13,077 --> 01:32:15,118
[Norman] My finger!
My fuckin' finger!

1358
01:32:15,284 --> 01:32:17,117
Chester,
my fuckin' finger, man!

1359
01:32:17,284 --> 01:32:19,117
He cut off my fuckin' finger!

1360
01:32:19,284 --> 01:32:21,908
Oh! lt hurts!

[Singing

1362
01:32:24,075 --> 01:32:27,199
My fuckin' finger, Chester!
He cut off my fuckin' finger!

1363
01:32:27,367 --> 01:32:31,449
Aaah! Oh, Leo!

1364
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:35,614
[All Shouting]

1365
01:32:38,698 --> 01:32:40,572
[Chester] Call Cedars, man!
Call fuckin' Cedars!

1366
01:32:40,739 --> 01:32:43,072
[Norman]
Wrap it up! Wrap it up!

1367
01:32:43,239 --> 01:32:46,655
[Leo] Uh, yes, hi.
Could I talk to Don Levine, please?

1368
01:32:46,822 --> 01:32:51,446
[Norman Groaning] Why'd you let me
do this? Why'd you let me do this?

1369
01:32:51,613 --> 01:32:54,654
[Groans]

1370
01:32:54,822 --> 01:32:57,404
[Leo] What? What do you mean
he's in surgery?

1371
01:32:57,571 --> 01:33:00,111
He was expecting my call.
He was supposed to be there.

1372
01:33:00,279 --> 01:33:04,278
What? Who the fuck has
plastic surgery at 6:30 in
the morning on New Year's Eve?
