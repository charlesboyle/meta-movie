00:49:28,236 --> 00:49:29,153
Drive!

550
00:49:36,778 --> 00:49:38,445
Reese!

551
00:49:38,512 --> 00:49:39,646
Reese!

552
00:49:57,232 --> 00:49:58,932
No, Reese! No! No!

553
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,633
No! They'll kill you.

554
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:02,585
Policeman:
You in the Cadillac!

555
00:50:02,654 --> 00:50:04,054
Let me see
your hands now!

556
00:50:06,391 --> 00:50:08,358
Get out of the car!

557
00:50:12,029 --> 00:50:14,198
Drop to your knees!

558
00:50:14,265 --> 00:50:15,649
Out of the car.

559
00:50:15,717 --> 00:50:17,333
Drop to the ground.

560
00:50:45,263 --> 00:50:47,363
Sarah...

561
00:50:47,431 --> 00:50:50,534
Sarah, try to drink
some of this.

562
00:50:51,602 --> 00:50:54,554
Are you sure it's them?

563
00:50:54,622 --> 00:50:57,624
Maybe I should look
at the bodies.

564
00:50:57,692 --> 00:50:59,425
No. They've
been identified,

565
00:50:59,427 --> 00:51:00,727
and there's
no doubt.

566
00:51:00,795 --> 00:51:02,662
Oh, God.

567
00:51:02,664 --> 00:51:04,331
God!

568
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:06,500
Ginger!

569
00:51:10,037 --> 00:51:11,171
Sarah.

570
00:51:12,206 --> 00:51:14,324
Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.

571
00:51:14,392 --> 00:51:15,742
Hi, Sarah.

572
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:16,860
I want you to tell him
everything

573
00:51:16,928 --> 00:51:18,295
that Reese told you.

574
00:51:18,363 --> 00:51:19,696
Do you feel up to that?

575
00:51:19,764 --> 00:51:21,932
Yeah. I guess so.

576
00:51:23,467 --> 00:51:25,235
You're a doctor?

577
00:51:25,303 --> 00:51:27,870
Criminal
psychologist.

578
00:51:27,938 --> 00:51:29,156
Is Reese crazy?

579
00:51:29,223 --> 00:51:45,455
Well, that's what
we're gonna find out.

580
00:51:45,522 --> 00:51:47,624
[Distant siren]

581
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:49,051
[Whirring]

582
00:52:57,344 --> 00:53:00,946
So, you're a soldier,
fighting for whom?

583
00:53:01,982 --> 00:53:04,984
With the 132nd,
under Perry.

584
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:07,720
From 21 to 27.

585
00:53:07,787 --> 00:53:10,606
That's the year 2027?

586
00:53:10,673 --> 00:53:12,641
That's right.
And I was assigned...

587
00:53:12,709 --> 00:53:14,110
This is
fucking great.

588
00:53:14,177 --> 00:53:16,812
...the last 2 years
under John Connor.

589
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,063
Who was the enemy again?

590
00:53:18,131 --> 00:53:19,832
A computer defense system
built for--

591
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:20,817
[beep beep beep]

592
00:53:20,884 --> 00:53:22,418
Oh, damn. Sorry.

593
00:53:22,486 --> 00:53:25,921
Built for sac-NORAD
by cyberdine systems.

594
00:53:25,989 --> 00:53:27,423
I see.

595
00:53:27,491 --> 00:53:31,093
And this, uh, computer
thinks it can win

596
00:53:31,161 --> 00:53:34,163
by killing the mother
of its enemy,

597
00:53:34,231 --> 00:53:35,681
killing him, in effect,

598
00:53:35,749 --> 00:53:37,383
before
he's even conceived,

599
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:39,752
a sort of
retroactive abortion?

600
00:53:39,819 --> 00:53:42,354
That guy Silberman
cracks me up.

601
00:53:42,422 --> 00:53:44,824
Last week, he had this guy
in here that burned his Afghan.

602
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:46,659
He screwed it first,
then he set it on fire.

603
00:53:46,726 --> 00:53:47,760
Hey, shut up.

604
00:53:47,828 --> 00:53:49,945
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor then?

605
00:53:50,013 --> 00:53:52,515
Why this elaborate scheme
with the Terminator?

606
00:53:52,582 --> 00:53:54,350
It had no choice.

607
00:53:54,418 --> 00:53:57,136
Their defense grid
was smashed.

608
00:53:57,203 --> 00:53:58,554
We'd won.

609
00:53:58,621 --> 00:54:01,457
Taking out Connor then
would make no difference.

610
00:54:01,525 --> 00:54:04,810
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

611
00:54:04,878 --> 00:54:06,762
Is that when you
captured the lab complex

612
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:08,564
and found that--
uh, what is it called?

613
00:54:08,632 --> 00:54:11,934
The time displacement
equipment?

614
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:16,305
That's right. The Terminator
had already gone through.

615
00:54:16,372 --> 00:54:19,275
Connor sent me to intercept,
and they blew the whole place.

616
00:54:19,342 --> 00:54:21,277
How are you
supposed get back?

617
00:54:21,344 --> 00:54:23,329
I can't.

618
00:54:25,032 --> 00:54:26,833
Nobody goes home.

619
00:54:28,735 --> 00:54:31,437
Nobody else comes through.

620
00:54:31,504 --> 00:54:35,374
It's just him...And me.

621
00:56:05,248 --> 00:56:06,748
[Cocks rifle]

622
00:56:19,362 --> 00:56:22,180
It's just him...And me.

623
00:56:24,467 --> 00:56:27,402
Why didn't you
bring any weapons,

624
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:29,404
something
more advanced?

625
00:56:29,472 --> 00:56:33,108
Don't you have
ray guns?

626
00:56:33,176 --> 00:56:34,242
Ray guns.

627
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:37,045
Show me a piece of
future technology.

628
00:56:37,113 --> 00:56:38,947
You go naked.

629
00:56:39,014 --> 00:56:41,249
Something about the field
generated by a living organism.

630
00:56:41,317 --> 00:56:42,750
Nothing dead will go.

631
00:56:42,818 --> 00:56:43,885
Why?

632
00:56:43,953 --> 00:56:46,121
I didn't build
the fucking thing!

633
00:56:46,188 --> 00:56:48,223
Ok, ok.
But this...

634
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:50,859
[Sighs] Cyborg,
if it's metal--

635
00:56:50,927 --> 00:56:52,127
surrounded
by living tissue!

636
00:56:52,195 --> 00:56:53,378
Oh. Right,
right--

637
00:56:53,446 --> 00:56:54,712
this is great stuff.

638
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,681
I could make a career
out of this guy.

639
00:56:56,748 --> 00:56:58,383
You see how clever
this part is?

640
00:56:58,451 --> 00:56:59,650
How it doesn't require
a shred of proof?

641
00:56:59,718 --> 00:57:01,453
Most paranoid delusions
are intricate,

642
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,488
but this is brilliant.

643
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:06,924
Why were the other
2 women killed?

644
00:57:06,992 --> 00:57:09,544
Most of the records
were lost in the war.

645
00:57:09,612 --> 00:57:12,130
Skynet knew almost nothing
about Connor's mother.

646
00:57:12,198 --> 00:57:16,251
Her full name, where she lived.
They just knew the city.

647
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,519
The Terminator was
just being systematic.

648
00:57:18,588 --> 00:57:20,421
Uh-huh. Well,
let's go back to--

649
00:57:20,489 --> 00:57:23,308
look, you have heard enough!
I have answered your questions!

650
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:25,643
Now I have to see
Sarah Connor!

651
00:57:25,645 --> 00:57:27,462
I'm afraid
that's not up to me.

652
00:57:27,529 --> 00:57:29,097
Then why am I
talking to you?

653
00:57:29,165 --> 00:57:30,298
Because
I can help you.

654
00:57:30,366 --> 00:57:31,766
Who is in
authority here? Reese--

655
00:57:31,834 --> 00:57:32,901
shut up!

656
00:57:32,969 --> 00:57:35,837
You still don't
get it, do you?

657
00:57:35,905 --> 00:57:37,338
He'll find her.

658
00:57:37,406 --> 00:57:38,940
That's what he does!

659
00:57:39,008 --> 00:57:42,110
That's all he does!

660
00:57:42,178 --> 00:57:44,045
You can't stop him!

661
00:57:44,113 --> 00:57:45,764
He'll wade through you,
reach down her throat,

662
00:57:45,832 --> 00:57:47,749
and pull
her fucking heart out!

663
00:57:47,816 --> 00:57:49,034
Doc.

664
00:57:49,102 --> 00:57:50,368
Let go of me--

665
00:57:53,622 --> 00:57:55,190
sorry.

666
00:58:00,295 --> 00:58:01,997
So, Reese is crazy?

667
00:58:02,064 --> 00:58:03,848
In technical
terminology--

668
00:58:03,916 --> 00:58:05,783
he's a loon.

669
00:58:05,851 --> 00:58:09,955
Sarah, this is what
they call body armor.

670
00:58:10,022 --> 00:58:11,923
Our tac guys wear these.

671
00:58:11,991 --> 00:58:14,125
It'll stop
a 12-gauge round.

672
00:58:14,193 --> 00:58:15,660
This other individual
must have been wearing one

673
00:58:15,728 --> 00:58:16,895
under his coat.

674
00:58:16,963 --> 00:58:18,546
Feel that. Go ahead.

675
00:58:20,432 --> 00:58:22,166
What about when he punched
through the windshield?

676
00:58:22,234 --> 00:58:23,818
He was probably
on PCP.

677
00:58:23,886 --> 00:58:25,353
Broke every bone
in his hand

678
00:58:25,421 --> 00:58:27,189
and wouldn't feel it
for hours.

679
00:58:27,256 --> 00:58:28,990
There was this guy once--
you see this scar?

680
00:58:29,058 --> 00:58:29,991
Here.

681
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:31,726
Thank you.

682
00:58:31,794 --> 00:58:33,094
There's a couch
in this other room.

683
00:58:33,162 --> 00:58:35,614
Why don't you stretch out
and try to get some sleep?

684
00:58:35,681 --> 00:58:36,815
It'll be at least an hour

685
00:58:36,882 --> 00:58:38,549
before your mother gets here
from big bear.

686
00:58:38,618 --> 00:58:39,951
I can't sleep.

687
00:58:40,019 --> 00:58:41,653
Try.

688
00:58:41,721 --> 00:58:43,171
Well,
it may not look it,

689
00:58:43,239 --> 00:58:45,673
but that couch
is very comfortable.

690
00:58:46,642 --> 00:58:49,244
You'll be
perfectly safe.

in this building.

Could I see her, please?

699
00:59:20,576 --> 00:59:22,944
No. You can't see her.
She's making a statement.

700
00:59:23,012 --> 00:59:24,328
Where is she?

it may take a while.

702

there's a bench over there.

for an unident--

01:04:04,075 --> 01:04:05,642
take this.

734
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:11,181
All right, let's get this
off the road.

735
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:43,247

736
01:04:43,314 --> 01:04:45,682

742
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,707

go through time?

01:05:21,619 --> 01:05:23,587
It's like
being born maybe.

746

Oh, my God.

747
01:05:26,607 --> 01:05:29,343
I caught one
back there.

748
01:05:29,411 --> 01:05:32,362
You mean
you got shot?

749
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:33,747
It's not bad.

750
01:05:33,815 --> 01:05:36,016
We got to get you
to a doctor.

751
01:05:36,084 --> 01:05:38,018
It's ok. Forget it.

752
01:05:38,086 --> 01:05:41,021
What do you mean, forget it?
Are you crazy?

753

755
01:05:56,103 --> 01:05:59,038
See, it passed
right through the meat.

756
01:05:59,106 --> 01:06:02,058
Oh, this is going
to make me puke.

757
01:06:02,126 --> 01:06:04,294
Would you just
talk about something?

758
01:06:04,362 --> 01:06:05,545
What?

759
01:06:05,613 --> 01:06:07,364
I don't know.
Anything. Just talk.

760
01:06:07,432 --> 01:06:09,399
Tell me about my son.

761

Aah!

763
01:06:15,606 --> 01:06:18,708

01:06:21,446 --> 01:06:23,547
What's he like?

765
01:06:23,614 --> 01:06:26,050
You trust him.

766
01:06:26,117 --> 01:06:28,452
He's got a strength.

767
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:31,338
I'd die for John Connor.

768
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:37,744
Well...At least now I know
what to name him.

769
01:06:37,812 --> 01:06:40,598
I don't suppose
you know who the father is,

770
01:06:40,665 --> 01:06:43,500
so I won't tell him
to get lost when I meet him.

771
01:06:43,568 --> 01:06:46,002
John never said
much about him.

772
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:47,504
I know he dies
before the war--

773
01:06:47,572 --> 01:06:49,139
wait!

774
01:06:51,075 --> 01:06:53,143
I don't want to know.

775
01:06:53,211 --> 01:06:57,013
So, was it John
that sent you here?

776
01:06:57,081 --> 01:06:58,649
I volunteered.

777
01:07:00,084 --> 01:07:01,217
Why?

778
01:07:01,285 --> 01:07:05,021
It was a chance
to meet the legend--

779
01:07:05,089 --> 01:07:07,157
Sarah Connor.

780
01:07:07,225 --> 01:07:12,412
Taught her son
to fight, organize,

when he was a kid.

782
01:07:14,766 --> 01:07:17,217
When you were in hiding
before the war...

783
01:07:20,121 --> 01:07:22,356
You're talking about things
that I haven't done yet

784
01:07:22,424 --> 01:07:23,690
in the past tense.

785
01:07:23,758 --> 01:07:25,426
It's driving me crazy.

Aah!

787
01:07:30,131 --> 01:07:33,066
Are you sure
you have the right person?

788
01:07:33,134 --> 01:07:34,501
I'm sure.

789
01:07:34,569 --> 01:07:36,003
Come on.

790
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:40,507
Do I look like
the mother of the future?

791
01:07:40,575 --> 01:07:43,010
I mean, am I tough,
organized?

792
01:07:43,077 --> 01:07:45,679
I can't even
balance my checkbook.

793
01:07:48,616 --> 01:07:51,368
Look, Reese, I didn't
ask for this honor,

794
01:07:51,436 --> 01:07:54,171
and I don't want it!
Any of it!

795
01:07:57,676 --> 01:07:59,993
Your son gave me a message
to give to you.

796
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:01,828
Made me memorize it.

what you must soon face

800
01:08:07,985 --> 01:08:10,721
except to say that
the future is not set.

801
01:08:10,788 --> 01:08:13,440
You must be stronger
than you imagine you can be.

802
01:08:13,508 --> 01:08:17,027
You must survive,
or I will never exist.

803

That's all.

field dressing.

Ok.

811
01:08:51,061 --> 01:08:53,162

812

813
01:08:58,569 --> 01:09:01,170
Tell me about
where you're from.

814

All right.

815
01:09:06,577 --> 01:09:08,478
You stay down by day,

816

but at night
you can move around.

817
01:09:11,115 --> 01:09:13,249
You still
have to be careful

818
01:09:13,317 --> 01:09:16,887
because the hks
use infrared.

819
01:09:16,955 --> 01:09:20,288

not too bright.

to dust them.
