1
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:06,658
Where's Emma? Emma?!

2
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:12,063
Emma! Emma!

3
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,300
Emma, where are you, honey?
Emma?

4
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:17,302
Emma?

5
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:20,571
Oh God. Oh my God.

6
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,442
Are you okay?
Oh God.

7
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,445
Okay. Okay.

8
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,647
Oh, thank God.

9
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,552
I saw a scary man.

10
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,999
Neither fate nor society

11
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,968
put Francis Mulligan
in the house

12
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,736
of Gloria Mitchell
on the night of the 15th.

13
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,205
Neither fate nor society

14
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:57,709
told him to tie her up,
shove a gun in her face

15
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,510
and steal her belongings.

16
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,080
That was his choice.

17
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:12,757
The defense would have you
walk in his client's shoes.

18
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:19,063
Well, I have.

19
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,532
I'm from Riverdale.

20
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,601
It's a craphole.

21
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,537
Nobody's saying
it's not, but...

22
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,342
that's where I'm from.
It's not who I am.

23
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,281
<i>He is not the victim here.</i>

24
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:44,055
So if you are gonna put
yourself in anyone's shoes...

25
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,691
put yourself...

26
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:49,527
in Gloria Mitchell's.

27
00:03:53,465 --> 00:03:54,565
Thank you.

28
00:03:56,802 --> 00:04:00,338
The jury will now adjourn
to deliberate a verdict.

29
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:05,643
Nice close.
Straight to your top five.

30
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,578
- You like that?
- Yeah, I did.

31
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,148
"Not who I am."
That was very cute.

32
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,683
- I gotta go.
- Mitch, the jury only just left.

33
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,053
Guilty, five years,
parole after two.

34
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,355
- How do you know that?
- One, the judge is soft

35
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,324
on the educationally-challenged
and nobody got shot.

36
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,826
And two?

37
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,628
I don't lose.

38
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,129
Well, that part's true.

39
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,265
<i>- That's why I hate you.
- See you tonight.</i>

40
00:04:40,612 --> 00:04:42,313
Look up. Look up.

41
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,749
Please.

42
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:50,188
- One more.
- No. Absolutely not.

43
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,692
- Look at those tiny little hands.
- I know.

44
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:04,702
I can't believe her. Looks so perfect.

45
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:08,706
She's so peaceful.

46
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:12,110
Thank you.

47
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,146
We're lucky.

48
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:21,119
I'm sorry I have to go
to this work thing tonight.

49
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,187
I wish I could
stay here with you.

50
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:32,396
- Help me.
- Careful, it's slippery.

51
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:36,267
Guys.
Tomorrow, thank you.

52
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,769
Good night, boys.

53
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,205
I fucking hate Tequila!

54
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,707
Everybody hates Tequila.
That's the idea.

55
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,609
Well, I--
I didn't know what to get

56
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,744
the man who has everything, so--

57
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:50,248
He's got a career,
a beautiful little baby...

58
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,917
- Oh, my little baby.
- ...a sexy wife.

59
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,453
- Careful.
- And then it hits me--

60
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,755
I'm gonna get the man
a Tequila hangover.

61
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,724
So, Mitch, tomorrow morning,

62
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,065
you are gonna wake up
complete, my friend.

63
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:01,626
That's right.

64
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,227
- Thank you. Thank you.
- I helped.

65
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,862
Complete.

66
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,230
You okay getting home?

67
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,232
Yeah. Gonna get a--

68
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,234
- gonna get a cab.
- All right.

69
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,336
Oh.

70
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:16,574
<i>- Hello?

71
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,644

Yeah. Ugh.
See you tomorrow.

75
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,323
Listen, when you throw up
in the middle of the night,

76
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,292
- aim away from your baby.
- Yeah, I will.

77
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,893
- Aim away from the baby.
- Away from the baby.

78
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,894
I promise.

79
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,597
Don't puke on
your child, Mitch.

80
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,933
- I won't puke on my child.
- Until tomorrow.

81
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,301
Tomorrow.

82
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:45,970
Don't be late!

83
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,575

<i>Inner-City taxi. Hello?</i>

86

Can I help you guys?

87
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:02,386
What the fuck?

88
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,528
Oh, fuck it.

89
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,314
Fuck.

90
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,415
Fuck.

Oh shit.

97

Hey, I'll get an ambulance.

Oh fuck.
Oh fuck.

99
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,643
Take this.

100
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,378
It's okay. I'm gonna get help.

101
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,080
I'm gonna get an ambulance,
all right? Hold in there.

102
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:20,024
Okay. Okay.

103
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:23,594
Hey. Two minutes.
I promise.

104
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,963
- Don't leave me.
- Just gonna call an ambulance.

105

<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

107
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:45,149
I need an ambulance.
A guy's been hit by a car.

108
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,752
<i>- What's the location, sir?
- Uh, Keeler.</i>

109
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,488
<i>- Keeler and 26th.
- What's your name, sir?</i>

110
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,957
Please just hurry.
Hurry, he's hurt real bad.

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,759
<i>Sir.</i>

112
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:09,707
The ambulance is coming.

- I have to go. I can't stay.

114

Fuck. Fuck.

An ambulance is coming, okay?

120
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,427
Okay?

121
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,028
Don't leave me, please.

122
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,605
- There's daddy. Hey, lover.
- Hey.

123
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,607
What on earth are you doing up?

124
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,677
- I didn't sleep great.
- Hangover?

125
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,879
Yeah.

126
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,682
How are you?

127
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:07,985
Well, apparently they wake up every
two hours and they demand food.

128
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:11,355
- Who knew?
- Can I help?

129
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:16,193
Yes, you could fix the garage doors.
They're driving me crazy.

130
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,695
<i>Just gonna grab some diapers.</i>

131

00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,175
<i>just be careful out there, folks.

00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,710
<i>- Mitch.
- Uh-huh.</i>

137
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:35,045
<i>Something you wanna tell me?</i>

138
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,815
What?

139
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,683
About last night?

140
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:45,222
<i>- What?
- And the car?</i>

141
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,995
Rach...

142
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:54,398
uh...

143
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,033
<i>And why it's parked
in the garage?</i>

144
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,668
Did you drive home?

145
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:03,340
Yeah.

146
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,110
<i>- You promised to take a cab.
- I know.</i>

147
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,178
No, I mean-- What, are you crazy?
'Cause if you get a D.U.I.,

148
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,747
then you can kiss
the D.A.'s office goodbye.

149
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,348
I know.
I know, I'm sorry.

150
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,384
I shouldn't have.
I won't do it again.

151
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,386
Mitch, I am serious.
You're a father now, okay?

152
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,421
You can't afford
to take chances.

153
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,357
I know. I'm sorry.

154
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,726
I'm sorry.

155
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,162
See?
Look, even Ella agrees.

156
00:14:26,097 --> 00:14:27,164
Ella?

157
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:29,800
Are you sure?

158
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,369
Mm-hmm.
Don't change the topic.

159
00:14:33,905 --> 00:14:36,440
I don't know what I'd do
if I lost you guys.

160
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:39,410
Mmm. Here, let me take her.
You go to bed.

161
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:42,246
Go get some rest.

162
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,114
There you go. Thanks.

163
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:47,084
Just an hour.

164
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,689
Shh shh shh.

165
00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:04,762
- Hey.
- You okay?

166
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,831
Yeah.
Could you call around

167
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,466
the local hospitals
and clinics?

168
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,335
I'm trying to track down
a young man who was involved

169
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,771
in a hit-and-run accident
last night around midnight.

170
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:16,940
- What case is it connected to?
- Just let me know what you find.

171
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,857
- Yeah.
- Over there.

172
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,392
Thanks.

173
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,433
- Morning, officers.
- Good morning.

174
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:46,003
- Good. This way.
- Thanks.

175
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:56,046
<i>I'm down here in
front of the police department</i>

176
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,949
with the story of the tragic
death of this local young man.

177
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:02,452
What started out as a routine
traffic stop last night

178
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:05,255
has turned into a gruesome
murder investigation

179
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,224
<i>when police officers
stopped this van</i>

180
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,226
<i>parked behind me
in the police impound</i>

181
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,395
for nothing more than
a burnt-out taillight.

182
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,897
When they saw blood dripping
from the rear door,

183
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,566
they demanded
the driver open the van

184
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:18,902
and it was then they discovered
the body of Cecil Ackerman,

185
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,605
<i>a 24-year-old parolee
from Naperville.</i>

186
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,841
Please don't.

187
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,609
<i>The driver claims
he found Ackerman</i>

188
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,278
dying in the road
from an apparent hit-and-run

189
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,547
and was merely trying
to get him to the hospital.

190
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,116
<i>This is Jeff Franklin,
reporting live from the scene.</i>

191
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:48,599
Hey, counselor.

192
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,868
Thanks.

193
00:18:03,414 --> 00:18:04,882
Yeah?

194
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:08,151
- Detective Kanon?
- Yeah.

195
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,187
How many "T"s in "committed"?

196
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:13,523
- Two.
- Fucking paperwork.

197
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:16,593
You got here fast.

198
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,962
Yeah.

199
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,430
You said you were interested
in the Ackerman murder?

200
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,965
Yes, I am.

201
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,401
D.A. assigned just you?

202
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,005
Well, it's just
a provisional inquiry.

203
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:33,010
<i>Walk with me.</i>

204
00:18:36,547 --> 00:18:38,949
<i>Suspect's name is
Clinton Davis.</i>

205
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,652
<i>55; Car mechanic;</i>

206
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:45,022
<i>couple of assault charges,
nothing he did time for;</i>

207
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,457
no relatives;
Wife and daughter were murdered

208
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,559
in a home invasion
a few years back.

209
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,362
Priest was in here already,

210
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,564
saying what a good guy he is,
how he'd never hurt a fly,

211
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,699
- et cetera.
- They said on the news

212
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,068
that he found Cecil
Ackerman in the road.

213
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,170
Yeah, we've been there.

214
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,572
No broken car parts,
no blood that we could see.

215
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:05,075
Yeah, but the snow
thawed overnight, so...

216
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:10,047
we've got Ackerman's blood and
hair all over Davis's clothes.

217
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:13,150
We've got the bloody tools and the
plastic sheets in the back of his van.

218
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,685
We've got enough to charge him.

219
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,587
You guys need to decide
if it's enough to convict.

220
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:22,092
- He looks terrified.
- He should be.

221
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:25,562
He's staring down 20 to life
for this one alone.

222
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:29,199
This one?

223
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,701
I ran some keywords
through the database.

224
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:33,136
It flagged a string
of unsolved homicides.

225
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:36,340
You think this guy's
a serial killer?

226
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:39,977
You don't even know
that he killed this guy.

227
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:44,181
Tell your boss we'll send him
everything we got.

228
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:08,305
- Mitch.
- I have a request, sir.

229
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:12,776
Thanks. Hey.

230
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,112
Mitch Brockden,
D.A.'s office.

231
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:16,713
My associate Stuart Wilson.

232
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,082
Terry Roberts, public
defender's office.

233
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,484
There you go.

234
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:26,023
Mr. Davis, we're going
to ask you a few questions

235
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,391
about the night of the 4th.

236
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,793
If you can answer
as accurately as possible--

237
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:32,562
You're gonna be my prosecutor?

238
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:35,432
Uh, if this goes to trial,

239
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:36,800
then yes, I am.

240
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,803
I didn't do anything.
I'm innocent.

241
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,772
Then you've got nothing
to worry about.

242
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:44,408
Okay, Mr. Davis,

243
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,777
let's start with you
telling us where you were

244
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,780
earlier that evening.

245
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:52,315
Left work, went to group,

246
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,284
went for a drive.

247
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:55,786
Group?

248
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:59,689
Yeah, I help out
at some support groups.

249
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:03,260
- And the drive?
- Just something I do.

250
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,529
It's not against
the law, right?

251
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:08,732
I mean, don't you ever go out
and drive around at night?

252
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,138
Due respect, I think
that's beside the point.

253
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,441
I don't like to spend
too much time at home.

254
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,276
It brings back memories--

255
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,446
My wife and child.

256
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:27,084
Uh, yes.

257
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,152
I heard what happened
to your family.

258
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:31,455
I'm-- I'm sorry.

259
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:35,325
Emanuel fryer.
Gunned down the next night

260
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,360
attacking
someone else's family.

261
00:21:39,297 --> 00:21:41,131
<i>What do we know
about the victim?</i>

262
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,401
Cecil Ackerman--
registered sex offender;

263
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,870
two counts of child sex
abuse; Did two years inside;

264
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,872
was only out
on parole three months.

265
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,508
So a real loss to society.

266
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,244
So far there's no connection
between him and Davis.

267
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,847
- What about the murder weapon?
- Weapons.

268
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:59,416
The coroner couldn't be exact,

269
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,351
but he suggested these
wounds could be consistent

270
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,853
with the type of tools
and machine parts

271
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,888
found in the back
of Davis's van.

272
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,857
- Could be?
- Well, they also found

273
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,126
significant amounts of oil
and grit in the wounds,

274
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:11,261
which corroborates Davis's
hit-and-run story.

275
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,163
True, but the Vic's
D.N.A. And blood were

276
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,165
all over Davis's clothes,
inside his van.

277
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,501
Which could've got there when he
lifted Ackerman into his van.

278
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,736
Yeah, or when he murdered him.
Davis has two counts

279
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,538
- of aggravated assault.
- At a time when his family

280
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,507
had just been murdered
in a home invasion.

281
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,743
He hasn't had so much
as a parking ticket since.

282
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,578
What's bothering you, Mitch?

283
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,413
I don't see motive.

284
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,219
Just got this audio file.

285
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:38,889
Here's the transcript.

286
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:41,458
<i>It was a 911 call.
Somebody called in an accident</i>

287
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,460
<i>20 minutes
before Davis was picked up.</i>

288
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,229
<i>By the time the ambulance
arrived at the location,</i>

289
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,398
<i>there was no one there.</i>

290
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,300
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

291
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,938
Is there any way
we can find the caller?

292
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,874
- No, he used a payphone.
- How do you know that?

293
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:03,246
If he used his cell, it would
have his name, phone records.

294
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:06,249
<i>Okay, 911 call's
potentially damaging,</i>

295
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:08,185
<i>but it's not conclusive.</i>

296
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:09,953
<i>And if we can't find
the caller,</i>

297
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,289
<i>defense probably can't either.</i>

298
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,558
<i>Could be anyone in Chicago.</i>

299
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,727
Mitch, where were you
that evening?

300
00:23:18,471 --> 00:23:21,198
- No, Mitch couldn't
string a sentence together

301
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,832
that night, right, Mitch?

302
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,468
<i>- Yeah, thanks, Stu.
- If it was a hit-and-run,</i>

303
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,737
all it takes is
for the guy who hit him

304
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,473
<i>to come forward and confess,
and we're dead in the water.</i>

305
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:34,311
<i>What's the likelihood
of anybody doing that, huh?</i>

306
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:38,348
Bottom line: Do we have
enough for a conviction?

307
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,318
Davis was found
with a dead man in his van.

308
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
We have a ton
of physical evidence.

309
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:45,689
No alibi, a documented
history of violence

310
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:47,290
and his public defender's
still in diapers.

311
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,392
Mitch will eat him
for breakfast.

312
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,702
Charge him, murder one.

313
00:24:06,777 --> 00:24:08,945
You examined
the body, doctor.

314
00:24:10,314 --> 00:24:13,316
In your professional...
opinion,

315
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,819
what was the cause of death?

316
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,787
Blunt force trauma
to the skull.

317
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,723
And what caused that trauma?

318
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:22,025
The back of the skull
was badly crushed,

319
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:25,528
so it's hard to narrow
it down to any one item,

320
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,664
but some of the marks
seemed consistent

321
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,367
with a hammer found
in the suspect's van.

322
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:33,837
And the interior was covered
in grease and motor oil,

323
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,741
so any type of violent
struggle in that environment

324
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:41,845
could've also caused those wounds
and left that trace evidence.

325
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,547
You said, "seemed consistent."

326
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,716
That's correct.

327
00:24:48,552 --> 00:24:51,554
Your report talks of abrasions

328
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:55,892
and impact wounds with grease
and motor oil in them.

329
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:59,796
Now the defense I'm sure
is gonna argue that--

330
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,732
<i>those wounds indicate</i>

331
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:05,335
<i>that a car ran over
Cecil Ackerman</i>

332
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,771
as per the defendant's testimony

333
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:10,307
and that the rest is just...

334
00:25:11,575 --> 00:25:14,444
a misinterpretation
of the evidence.

335
00:25:15,946 --> 00:25:18,348
No more questions, your honor.

336
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:26,923
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

337
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,059
<i>I need an ambulance.</i>

338
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:32,095
<i>- A guy's been hit by a car.
- What's the location, sir?</i>

339
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,064
<i>Uh, Keeler.
Keeler and 26th.</i>

340
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,799
<i>What's your name, sir?</i>

341
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,534
<i>Please just hurry.</i>

342
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,769
<i>- Hurry, he's hurt real bad.
- Sir.</i>

343
00:25:41,405 --> 00:25:44,040
It's your witness, Mr. Brockden.

344
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:55,051
Doctor, the jury will be unfamiliar
with your field of expertise,

345
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,121
so I'll ask
quite a simple question.

346
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:01,558
Just how accurate
is forensic linguistics?

347
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,094
- Extremely.
- But it's not perfect?

348
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:06,496
Perfection doesn't happen
in science.

349
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:10,600
Okay. On a sliding scale
of one to 10 then--

350
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,436
you may want
to object, counselor.

351
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:15,672
<i>The witness's field
is not on trial here.</i>

352
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,140
I'll withdraw
the question, your honor.

353
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,810
<i>You stated earlier
that you believe</i>

354
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:23,480
the caller to be genuine?

355
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:26,683
By this I assume you mean

356
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,685
he was reporting
a real accident.

357
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:29,819
Correct.

358
00:26:30,988 --> 00:26:33,123
And you can tell this
just by...

359
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:34,491
hearing his voice?

360
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:37,994
It's more complicated
than that, but yes.

361
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,930
What else can you tell
us about the caller?

362
00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:43,800
Hard to be certain

363
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,168
from the quality of the tape.

364
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,805
Sounded like a white male--
possibly in his 30s--

365
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,640
from the South of Chicago,

366
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,609
but he's tried hard
to soften the accent,

367
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,477
not unlike yourself, counselor.

368
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,945
Now you're from where,
Riverdale?

369
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,714
When you say it's hard
to tell for certain...

370
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,717
that the tape is unclear,

371
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:03,153
<i>that it seems to be
a white male--</i>

372
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:05,722
<i>The underlying ethnicity</i>

373
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,525
is hard to fully hide
from trained ears.

374
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:16,499
- Yes, it's a good recording.
- Uh-huh.

375
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,438
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you too.

376
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:29,145
- Hey.
- Staff meeting starts in five.

377
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,881
Someone named Jimmy called,
wouldn't leave a last name.

378
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:34,517
Said to tell you he's out
and wants to see you.

379
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,719
Left a contact number. Do you want
me to get him on the phone for you?

380
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,555
No no no, thank you.

381
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:44,694
Smell that?

382
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,163
That's the smell of freedom.

383
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:55,538
Hey, so I called
your house the other day,

384
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,140
you know, looking for ya.

385
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,977
Your wife...

386
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,514
she doesn't know
who I am, does she?

387
00:28:05,783 --> 00:28:07,584
You've been gone
a long time, Jimmy.

388
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,552
How do you not tell her about
your own fucking brother?

389
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,487
Step-brother.

390
00:28:11,922 --> 00:28:13,923
And let's face it,
legally not even that.

391
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:19,529
- You wanna play like that.
- Don't be fucking cute with me, Jimmy.

392
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:22,565
I was working at that warehouse

393
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:25,201
to pay my way through law
school when you fucking hit it!

394
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:29,772
I could've been done as
a fucking accessory. Huh?

395
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:32,575
- Bye-bye, career.
- Yeah, I know. I was fucking stupid.

396
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,745
Fuck, Mitch.

397
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:38,114
I mean, Jesus, I was doing
a lot of drugs back then.

398
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,250
I was selfish.

399
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:41,985
I've had a lot of fucking time

400
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:44,287
to think about my life,
think about who I was.

401
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,122
Okay?

402
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,658
Now I let you down.

403
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:51,961
But I will not
let you down again.

404
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,165
Look...

405
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,003
I met Rachel
when I was graduating.

406
00:29:01,572 --> 00:29:04,574
She processed my application
to the D.A.'s office.

407
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,843
Seeing as my ma never
officially married your dad--

408
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,811
yeah, you figured
why mention us, right?

409
00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:11,814
Jimmy, it was best
for me not to have ties

410
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,683
to a criminal past, you know?

411
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,286
Once I'd lied on the forms,

412
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:18,855
- I couldn't tell--
- yeah, I get it.

413
00:29:19,823 --> 00:29:21,024
I understand.

414
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:26,763
- God.
- I'm not that kid anymore.

415
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:30,733
Riverdale, it's...

416
00:29:32,703 --> 00:29:34,704
It was another life.

417
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,707
Well, lucky you.

418
00:29:39,343 --> 00:29:40,910
I only got the one.

419
00:29:43,614 --> 00:29:45,014
Hey.

420
00:30:11,308 --> 00:30:14,677
Hello?

421
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:16,946
<i>Hey, Mr. Brockden.
It's Kanon.</i>

422
00:30:18,148 --> 00:30:19,616
Detective Kanon.

423
00:30:20,884 --> 00:30:22,185
What can I do for you?

424
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,120
<i>Just checking in.</i>

425
00:30:25,222 --> 00:30:26,623
<i>We lost a point or two</i>

426
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,224
<i>on that forensic linguist.</i>

427
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,627
Yeah.

428
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:33,363
Yeah, I know.
It's, umm--

429
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:38,034
it's almost impossible to make
Davis the caller, so...

430
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:40,003
<i>Right.</i>

431
00:30:41,705 --> 00:30:43,373
It's kinda late, detective.

432
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,341
Is there something you need?

433
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,343
<i>No, just wanted to know</i>

434
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,278
<i>that you're ready for tomorrow.</i>

435
00:30:53,183 --> 00:30:55,918
<i>- What was that?
- What?</i>

436
00:30:57,855 --> 00:30:59,789
You're recording this?

437
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,891
<i>Why would I be recording this?</i>

438
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:05,361
<i>They say
that cops are paranoid.</i>

439
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,730
<i>See you in court.</i>

440
00:31:36,126 --> 00:31:38,728
She's asleep. Hey.

441
00:31:39,463 --> 00:31:40,430
Hey.

442
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,233
You smell like milk.

443
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,335
Ella was sick on me, again.

444
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,204
Nice.

445
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:53,443
<i>Mitch. Hey.</i>

446
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:55,144
Look at me.

447
00:31:57,481 --> 00:31:58,915
Mitch.

448
00:32:01,785 --> 00:32:03,386
What is it?

449
00:32:05,322 --> 00:32:07,323
Is there something
you're not telling me?

450
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:10,426
Yes.

451
00:32:12,296 --> 00:32:13,830
What?
Can't you just...

452
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:17,366
Tell me?

453
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,372
I love you.

454
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,785
I love you too.

455
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,127
<i>All rise.</i>

456
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,235
Be seated.

457
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,538
Before session begins,
your honor,

458
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,907
I would like
to approach the bench.

459
00:32:59,076 --> 00:33:02,078
I will not tolerate
tardiness, Mr. Roberts.

460
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,514
I'm sorry, your honor,
but there has been

461
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:06,816
an important development.

462
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:12,889
Defense would like
to call a new witness.

463
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:16,225
Objection, your honor.
The prosecution wasn't informed of this.

464
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:19,328
<i>Defense was unaware of their
identity until late last night.</i>

465
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,898
What is the relevance
of this witness, Mr. Roberts?

466
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,566
He's the man who
made the 911 call.

467
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,268
<i>- What? What?
- Order!</i>

468
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,370
<i>Order.</i>

469
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,071
- Your honor--
- I'm inclined to allow it, Mr. Brockden.

470
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:31,073
Yes, I understand that,
but if you could just--

471
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,442
<i>- Mr. Brockden!
- Dr. Brown's lab</i>

472
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:37,346
ran a voice analysis overnight
and we got a viable match.

473
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,882
How soon can defense
present this witness?

474
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:41,818
Right away, your honor.
He's been in the courtroom

475
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,586
<i>- this entire trial.
- Your honor, please!</i>

476
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:45,555
Can I just please say some--

477
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:47,557
Enough!

478
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,358
Call your witness.

479
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:52,461
The defense calls...

480
00:33:54,064 --> 00:33:55,898
<i>- Jimmy Logan to the stand.
- What?</i>

481
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,380
<i>In a surprise
twist of events,</i>

482
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,882
<i>a witness came forward today</i>

483
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,150
<i>and ended
the prosecution's case</i>

484
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,052
<i>against Clinton Davis.</i>

485
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,387
<i>The witness saw the victim,
Cecil Ackerman,</i>

486
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,256
<i>mowed down
by a hit-and-run driver</i>

487
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:23,860
<i>in a red S.U.V.
And left on the road to die.</i>

488
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:25,628
He then called 911.

489
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:28,598
It seems that Clinton Davis

490
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,100
was not the only
good samaritan in this trial.

491
00:34:34,304 --> 00:34:35,471
Mr. Davis?

492
00:34:38,475 --> 00:34:40,409
I just wanted
to wish you all the best.

493
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:42,612
Yeah, it's like you said--

494
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:45,915
if I was innocent,
everything would work out.

495
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,517
Yes, I did.

496
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,219
So what happens now?

497
00:34:53,423 --> 00:34:55,591
- You go back to your life.
- No no no,

498
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,260
I mean with
the hit-and-run driver,

499
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,895
the one the witness saw.

500
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,467
Maybe he'll turn himself in.

501
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,037
Would you?

502
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:34,564
<i>I fucking love you,
you fucking bitch!</i>

503
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,165
- Whore!
- Stop it!

504
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,534
- I'll fucking kill you!
- Stop it!

505
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:42,038
<i>- No! Leave me alone!
- Don't do this to me, you fucking bitch!</i>

506
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,205
I fucking love you!

507
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,474
- Hey!
- Fucking let me go!

508
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,144
<i>I fucking love you!</i>

509
00:36:30,053 --> 00:36:32,355
<i>The mutilated
body of Pedro Gonzales</i>

510
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:35,391
<i>was found early this morning on
the bank of the Chicago river.</i>

511
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,994
<i>According to a source
at the coroner's office,</i>

512
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:39,729
<i>the back of his skull
was badly crushed,</i>

513
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:42,231
<i>possibly by a hammer.</i>

514
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:45,468
<i>His family says the last time
anybody saw him alive</i>

515
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,370
<i>was at the north mall
on Saturday.</i>

516
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,813
<i>I ran some
keywords through the database.</i>

517
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:33,182
<i>It flagged a string
of unsolved homicides.</i>

518
00:39:34,938 --> 00:39:37,706
I can't stay here. Shit!

519
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:45,247
Oh fuck. No. No.

520
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,384
<i>I looked at
the autopsy results.</i>

521
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,953
The wounds on Ackerman were similar
to those found on Gonzales.

522
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,956
Ackerman was
a hit-and-run, remember?

523
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,758
The wounds were inconclusive.

524
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,459
You yourself pointed
that out at the trial.

525
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:58,961
Inconclusive, exactly.

526
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,829
What if it was both?

527
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:04,233
<i>What if Ackerman ran
into the path of a car</i>

528
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,302
because he was trying
to get away from Davis

529
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:07,836
who was in the process
of torturing him?

530
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:11,307
It explains why the
forensics was so confusing.

531
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:12,975
Anything else?

532
00:40:18,515 --> 00:40:20,482
Thanks for coming by.

533
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,401
Hey.

534
00:43:00,677 --> 00:43:02,411
Oh fuck.

535
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,646
Shit. Fuck.

536
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:15,210
Yes sir...

537
00:45:42,572 --> 00:45:44,673
Oh shit.

538
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:44,660
<i>- Yeah, hello.
- You get my photograph?</i>

539
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:50,966
- What do you want?
- Stop following me.

540
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:53,135
I know what you did.

541
00:47:53,137 --> 00:47:55,671
<i>And yet the cops
haven't come a'calling.</i>

542
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:58,206
Why you think that is, Mitch?

543
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,442
If you knew I was the driver,

544
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:03,078
why didn't you
just turn me in, huh?

545
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,281
<i>I didn't want to play my ace
in the police station.</i>

546
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:09,117
I needed to go to court.

547
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,420
I had to get a jury of my peers

548
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:14,756
to see your card,
find me innocent.

549
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:18,160
You wanted double jeopardy.

550
00:48:18,162 --> 00:48:20,128
<i>Bingo. A free pass.</i>

551
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:24,800
<i>- But you didn't expose me.
- There was no need.</i>

552
00:48:24,802 --> 00:48:27,469
I could see you were having
a crisis of conscience.

553
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:31,206
<i>- Is this a fucking game to you?
- Far from it.</i>

554
00:48:32,475 --> 00:48:34,342
I won't let you
get away with this.

555
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:36,812
Yeah, you will,

556
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:38,413
or I will ruin you.

557
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:42,984
Besides, who's gonna
protect Rachel and Ella

558
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:45,787
<i>when you get locked up
for hit-and-run, hmm?</i>

559
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:47,956
What did you say?

560
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:51,793
Family is
a precious thing, Mitch.

561
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:54,196
It's our job as men

562
00:48:54,198 --> 00:48:56,364
to protect 'em.

563
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,801
<i>Davis.</i>

564
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:21,757
Hey. Shut the door.

565
00:49:25,294 --> 00:49:27,129
Is that Ackerman?

566
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:29,831
And the guy from the news.

567
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:32,534
Have to work out
what links all these men.

568
00:49:33,836 --> 00:49:35,504
How he's picking
his victims and why.

569
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:37,372
How who's picking them?

570
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:39,174
Clinton Davis.

571
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:40,809
What?

572
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,512
These are
the unsolved homicides

573
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:45,313
that Kanon thinks
match Davis's M.O.

574
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,882
Davis's M.O.?

575
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:49,518
Dav-- Davis was innocent.

576
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,020
Hit-and-run, Mitch.
911 caller proved it.

577
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:53,889
Yeah, I wish
it were that simple.

578
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:56,558
What the hell is going on?

579
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,894
What the hell
is going on, Mitch?

580
00:49:58,896 --> 00:50:01,930
First you blow the Davis case,
almost get yourself disbarred

581
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,532
and now what?
You're trying to prove

582
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:06,001
that this guy is the
goddamn Boston strangler?

583
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,804
Stu, if I could
explain this, I would.

584
00:50:09,907 --> 00:50:12,574
With what pathologists
think were tools.

585
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:15,043
The first took place
eight months

586
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:17,913
after Davis's family was
tortured with similar tools.

587
00:50:17,915 --> 00:50:19,948
You see, I think he picked 'em.

588
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:22,050
<i>I think he picked all of them,</i>

589
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:25,554
<i>but what the fuck
do they all have in common?</i>

590
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:28,256
Well, Ackerman was
a child molester.

591
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:29,591
<i>None of the others were.</i>

592
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:32,460
Well, they do all have
criminal records.

593
00:50:33,896 --> 00:50:35,397
So you think
this behavior started

594
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:37,532
- with the death of his family, right?
- Yes, I do.

595
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,067
So remind me--
what happened there?

596
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:40,402
A man broke into their home

597
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:41,903
<i>and systematically tortured</i>

598
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:44,206
<i>and butchered
his wife and child...</i>

599
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:49,110
<i>using similar tools to the
ones that killed these guys.</i>

600
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:52,380
<i>The guy made Davis watch
the whole goddamn thing.</i>

601
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:00,856
<i>Then he slit his throat
and left him for dead.</i>

602
00:51:00,858 --> 00:51:02,891
<i>It was a miracle he survived.</i>

603
00:51:04,595 --> 00:51:06,628
The guy's name was
Emanuel Fryer--

604
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,630
career criminal;

605
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:11,299
gunned down the following night
during another home invasion;

606
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:14,603
recently paroled;
Blah blah blah.

607
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:17,138
<i>- Broken home--
- oh shit.</i>

608
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,373
What?

609
00:51:19,408 --> 00:51:21,176
Gonzales, recently paroled.

610
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:22,277
Fryer, recently paroled.

611
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:23,945
Ackerman
was recently--

612
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:25,614
all these men are
recently fucking paroled.

613
00:51:25,616 --> 00:51:28,984
Stu, you are a goddamn genius!

614
00:51:28,986 --> 00:51:32,020
Shit. I love you.
I love you.

615
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:41,630
Okay, so you're saying

616
00:51:41,632 --> 00:51:43,365
that the only reason
Ackerman was in the street

617
00:51:43,367 --> 00:51:44,633
was because
Davis was chasing him.

618
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:46,968
- Uh-huh.
- And then after you left,

619
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:49,004
- Davis finished the job?
-  Exactly.

620
00:51:49,006 --> 00:51:52,374
If I could just
get proof, you know?

621
00:51:52,376 --> 00:51:54,676
Davis can't be retried
for Ackerman,

622
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:56,978
but if I can
get evidence that he--

623
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,680
he killed those other guys,

624
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:00,415
I can cut us both a deal.

625
00:52:02,151 --> 00:52:04,119
What you said under oath,
what I did--

626
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,620
<i>You all right there?</i>

627
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:10,025
--What I did,
it just goes away.

628
00:52:10,027 --> 00:52:11,960
Mitch, I'm on parole.

629
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,029
I get busted breaking
into some guy's fucking house--

630
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:16,564
come on, I don't want you breaking in.
I'll break in.

631
00:52:17,967 --> 00:52:21,002
I just need
for you to tail him,

632
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:23,672
let me know
when he's coming back.

633
00:52:23,674 --> 00:52:26,341
Ah, it's just a little
aiding and abetting then.

634
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:27,709
Eh.

635
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,477
Forget it, Mitch.

636
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,579
Let it go. I'm done.

637
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,094
That fucker really break
into your house?

638
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:47,963
Yes.

639
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:51,032
While we were sleeping.

640
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:56,037
All right,
he's gonna know your ride.

641
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:57,405
Can you rent me
a clean set of wheels?

642
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:58,640
Of course.

643
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:01,977
Thanks, Jimmy.

644
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:04,446
You know what?
I mean that.

645
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,249
I may be an asshole,
but I'm still your brother.

646
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:57,826
<i>See you later, Davis.</i>

647
00:54:57,828 --> 00:54:59,294
All right, guys.
See you later.

648
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,695
Have a good evening.

649
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:29,711
Yo, Jimmy.

650
00:57:29,713 --> 00:57:31,679
Got anything
tying him to the victims?

651
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:34,315
No. Not yet.

652
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:37,619
Looks like he eats and sleeps
here, but that's about it.

653
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:40,622
The rest of the time
he spends in self-help groups.

654
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:43,391
You know, sometimes
he goes to two a night.

655
00:57:46,328 --> 00:57:48,930
Oh fuck.
That's it.

656
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:51,966
That's how
he picks his victims.

657
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:54,502
The guy that killed
his family was a parolee.

658
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:56,571
They're all parolee meetings.

659
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:59,274
Nobody notices
the guy making coffee.

660
00:57:59,276 --> 00:58:01,342
He just hangs around
like a fly on the wall,

661
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:03,878
<i>listening for the guy who feels
worried about re-offending.</i>

662
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,014
Yeah, I've been
to those meetings.

663
00:58:06,016 --> 00:58:08,049
- The room's full of guys like that.
- Exactly.

664
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:25,500
Fuck me.

665
00:58:26,835 --> 00:58:28,970
He kept their parolee cards.

666
00:58:31,006 --> 00:58:33,408
<i>Jimmy, what's that?</i>

667
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:35,677
Uh, we're near
the cement works.

668
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,478
<i>Must be coffee break
or something.</i>

669
00:58:38,614 --> 00:58:40,548
<i>You know, that's pretty close.</i>

670
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,450
Is he coming back?

671
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:44,519
I don't know.
He went into some old warehouse

672
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,421
and came out carrying something.
I lost him.

673
00:58:46,423 --> 00:58:51,459
- Looked like some old tools or something.
- Get the fuck outta there.

674
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:55,496
Jimmy? Jimmy!

675
00:58:57,099 --> 00:58:58,599
Jimmy, can you hear me?

676
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:01,436
<i>Jimmy?
Jimmy, are you there?</i>

677
00:59:01,438 --> 00:59:03,404
<i>I'm coming, Jimmy.</i>

678
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:05,506
I'm coming, Jimmy.

679
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:27,588
Jimmy!

680
01:00:28,657 --> 01:00:29,957
Jimmy!

681
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:38,099
Jimmy!

682
01:00:40,035 --> 01:00:41,202
Jimmy!

683
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:46,874
<i>- Jimmy!
- Aah! Fuck!</i>

684
01:00:58,554 --> 01:01:02,190
Jimmy!

685
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:05,226
<i>- Mitch!
- Jimmy!</i>

686
01:01:06,862 --> 01:01:08,696
<i>Help me!</i>

687
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:10,998
<i>You gotta help me, Mitch!</i>

688
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
<i>Help... Mitch.</i>

689
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,235
<i>Yo, Jimmy!</i>

690
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:17,171
<i>Oh, please help me!</i>

691
01:01:20,042 --> 01:01:22,910
- Jimmy!
- Mitch!

692
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:24,545
Mitch!

693
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:27,882
Oh, Jesus Christ.

694
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:29,183
Oh Jimmy.

695
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:33,187
<i>911, what
is your emergency?</i>

696
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,556
Help me.

697
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:37,592
Help me, please.

698
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:39,527
He's trying to kill me.

699
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,229
<i>- Hurry.
- Sir?</i>

700
01:01:41,231 --> 01:01:43,097
<i>Sir, who is trying to kill you?</i>

701
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,967
<i>Sir? Sir, are you there?</i>

702
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:47,134
<i>Sir?</i>

703
01:01:54,109 --> 01:01:55,943
Hello? Yeah,
I need an ambulance.

704
01:01:58,515 --> 01:02:00,114
Can you hear--
can you hear me?

705
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:01,616
<i>Hello?</i>

706
01:02:01,618 --> 01:02:02,984
Yeah, I need an ambulance.

707
01:02:02,986 --> 01:02:05,686
Fuck! Fuck!

708
01:02:23,672 --> 01:02:26,140
Stay with me. I'm gonna move you, okay?

709
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:27,775
- Okay?
- Okay.

710
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:29,176
Okay okay, come on.

711
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:33,147
Come on, stay with me!

712
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:35,249
Come on!

713
01:02:45,794 --> 01:02:46,994
Let's go, men.

714
01:02:49,998 --> 01:02:51,699
Hey!

715
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:54,602
- Hey, he needs an ambulance.
- Set him down now!

716
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,571
<i>- Oh fuck.
- Put him down!</i>

717
01:02:56,573 --> 01:02:58,205
<i>- Do it!
- Put him down now!</i>

718
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:01,108
- Now! Down! Down!
- Fuck.

719
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,453
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
Oh fuck.

720
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:04,345
Go!

721
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:06,280
- He needs an ambulance!
- Cool it!

722
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:09,050
Jimmy. Oh God,
get him a fucking ambulance!

723
01:03:09,756 --> 01:03:12,153
Jimmy, hang in there.
Hang in there, brother.

724
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:15,189
<i>- Hang in there, brother.
- ...can and will be used against you...</i>

725
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:16,791
<i>- Calm down.
- Hang in there.</i>

726
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,225
You have the right
to an attorney.

727
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:19,660
We've got an injured white male.

728
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,602
<i>- How's Jimmy?
- He's in a coma...</i>

729
01:03:27,604 --> 01:03:29,637
<i>...but the doctors are hopeful.</i>

730
01:03:38,013 --> 01:03:41,048
So you wanna tell me what
your relationship is to him?

731
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:43,050
Yeah, we're, um...

732
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:44,652
step-brothers.

733
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,387
Our parents just never married.

734
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:48,356
That's why he'd lie
for you in court.

735
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:49,790
Exactly.

736
01:03:50,826 --> 01:03:52,293
So why turn on him now?

737
01:03:53,862 --> 01:03:55,363
What?

738
01:03:55,365 --> 01:03:57,765
<i>Was he blackmailing you?</i>

739
01:03:59,401 --> 01:04:01,335
What are you talking about?

740
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,404
I didn't do this.

741
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:06,007
Clinton Davis did this.

742
01:04:11,246 --> 01:04:12,947
- Using your hammer?
- Yes.

743
01:04:14,716 --> 01:04:17,385
He broke into my house,
he stole my tools.

744
01:04:17,387 --> 01:04:19,120
Did you report that?

745
01:04:20,889 --> 01:04:22,923
- No.
- No.

746
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:26,394
It's only your prints
on the hammer.

747
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:28,763
Jesus Christ.

748
01:04:28,765 --> 01:04:31,399
I made the 911 call,
for Christ's sakes.

749
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:32,900
Why would I do that
if I was guilty?

750
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:35,136
I really don't know, Mitch.

751
01:04:38,306 --> 01:04:40,408
But you did it before.

752
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,743
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

753
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:45,413
<i>I need an ambulance.
A guy's been hit by a car.</i>

754
01:04:45,415 --> 01:04:46,914
<i>What's the location, sir?</i>

755
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:48,783
<i>Uh, Keeler.</i>

756
01:04:48,785 --> 01:04:51,285
- That's you, right?
- Yes yes yes, it's me.

757
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:53,754
I hit Ackerman
with my car and I left.

758
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:56,390
It was wrong.
I know that, but I was scared.

759
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:59,160
I'd been drinking.
It was an accident.

760
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,734
We found this...

761
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:10,938
in the bottom of your toolbox.

762
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,908
It has Ackerman's blood
all over it.

763
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,711
Well, Davis must've
put it there.

764
01:05:18,346 --> 01:05:21,482
I dropped my cards
when I was helping Ackerman.

765
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,918
- I must've missed one.
- All of this...

766
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:28,022
- leads directly to you.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

767
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:31,092
<i>All right, listen, okay?
If I killed Ackerman,</i>

768
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:34,361
why didn't I crucify Davis in
court when I had the chance, hmm?

769
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:36,731
He was the perfect scapegoat.

770
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:42,336
Okay, there's a bag.

771
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:44,905
- There's a bag?
- Yes.

772
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:48,743
Davis kept the I.D.S
of all his victims.

773
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:51,779
He's targeting violent parolees

774
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,280
that he thinks
will re-offend,

775
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:55,282
like the man
that killed his family.

776
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:57,184
- Where's this bag?
- In his house.

777
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:58,786
How do you know this?

778
01:06:01,523 --> 01:06:03,891
- I broke in.
- You broke in?

779
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:08,763
You broke
into his fucking house?

780
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:10,965
Seriously, Mitch...

781
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:14,535
How do I know
you didn't put it there?

782
01:06:20,075 --> 01:06:22,510
You know, I don't think I should
answer any more questions

783
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:24,879
till I have a lawyer present.

784
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:29,350
You know, I think

785
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:31,786
that's a really good idea.

786
01:07:07,889 --> 01:07:11,025
You've got a call--
Stuart Wilson from the D.A.'s office.

787
01:07:16,531 --> 01:07:18,399
Stu, where the fuck
have you been?

788
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:20,434
<i>I'm sorry, Mitch.</i>

789
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:22,603
<i>This is the only way
they'd let me talk to you.</i>

790
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:26,307
Now you listen to me,
you fucking son of a bitch.

791
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:29,376
I will find you, I will come for
you and I will take your life.

792
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:32,379
<i>- You hear me, Davis?
- Oh, listen to you.</i>

793
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:35,549
Where was all that backbone
when you hit Ackerman, huh?

794
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,484
If you'd showed it then,

795
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:40,120
you would've waited for the
ambulance and he'd be alive.

796
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:42,323
Course, he'd still be free

797
01:07:42,325 --> 01:07:44,592
to go around hurting small children...

798
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,895
- ...which he was about
to do when I took him.

799
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,630
You do know that, right?

800
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:51,599
<i>If you'd let well enough alone,</i>

801
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:55,002
<i>we never would've come
to this place, Mitch.</i>

802
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:57,438
What do you want?

803
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,006
<i>You could've ruined my life</i>

804
01:07:59,008 --> 01:08:01,342
<i>or ruined yours,</i>

805
01:08:01,344 --> 01:08:04,178
but yet you found
a third option.

806
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:06,280
One that helped us both.

807
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:08,983
There is no fucking
third option here.

808
01:08:08,985 --> 01:08:10,351
<i>Yeah, there is.</i>

809
01:08:10,353 --> 01:08:13,153
What if another murder happened
with the same M.O.

810
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:15,656
While they have you
in custody, hmm?

811
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:19,960
Go a long way towards
shedding light on your innocence

812
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:24,131
or even throw a reasonable
doubt on your guilt.

813
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:26,267
<i>What are you--
what are you talking about,</i>

814
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:29,036
<i>- another murder?
- The problem is</i>

815
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:31,438
you don't know my pain

816
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,941
or my emptiness.

817
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:37,111
<i>But now you're going
to know what it is to be me.</i>

818
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:46,120
Davis?
Davis, what...?

819
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,188
Where are you, Davis? Huh?

820
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:49,690
I have to go now, Mitch.

821
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:51,692
Davis!

822
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:55,629
Hey! Is the line cut? Hey!

823
01:08:56,998 --> 01:08:58,933
I need a line.
I need an outside line.

824
01:08:58,935 --> 01:09:00,701
- Davis is going to kill my wife!
- Stop!

825
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:03,570
- Hey!
- He's gonna kill my fucking wife.

826
01:09:45,747 --> 01:09:47,548
- Mrs. Brockden?
- Yes.

827
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:50,284
I'm Detective Kanon.
I hate to bother you

828
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:52,119
at this ungodly hour,
but I'd like to ask you

829
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:53,620
some questions about your husband...

830
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:55,089
...if it's
all right with you.

831
01:09:55,091 --> 01:09:57,057
No, not at all.
Of co-- I'm--

832
01:09:57,059 --> 01:09:59,059
just one minute.

833
01:10:05,767 --> 01:10:09,103
<i>Suspect
is approximately 5'5"...</i>

834
01:10:37,665 --> 01:10:39,500
You know, I've been
calling all day and I--

835
01:10:41,236 --> 01:10:44,338
I hope you don't mind.

836
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,673
Hey, officer.
Just finished up with a client.

837
01:10:51,746 --> 01:10:54,782
Can you tell me what
you've arrested my husband for?

838
01:10:54,784 --> 01:10:56,817
- Murder.
- What?!

839
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:58,786
That-- I mean,
that's insane. Mitch--

840
01:10:58,788 --> 01:11:01,488
<i>I know.
I know it-- it's crazy.</i>

841
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:03,490
And I personally don't
believe he's guilty at all,

842
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:05,759
but I just need to ask you
some questions to clear--

843
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:09,063
Could you get me
a glass of water, please?

844
01:11:09,065 --> 01:11:11,165
Um, yeah, sure.

845
01:11:11,167 --> 01:11:13,434
Good night, counselor.

846
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:15,169
Drive safe.

847
01:11:28,683 --> 01:11:31,852
There you go.

848
01:11:31,854 --> 01:11:34,188
Look, I just don't understand.

849
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:37,524
If you know that he didn't do it,
then why are you still holding him?

850
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:41,395
Some of the other detectives are
having a problem with his story.

851
01:11:43,164 --> 01:11:46,633
But like I said,
once we have our conversation,

852
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:50,170
I'm sure we can
clear that all up.

853
01:12:17,699 --> 01:12:19,900
- He got a phone call and he went crazy.
- Who called?

854
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:22,202
Wilson or something
from the D.A.'s office.

855
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:23,904
He was ranting about
making another call,

856
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:26,273
said someone was gonna
kill his wife. Davis.

857
01:13:29,637 --> 01:13:30,971
What the hell's
going on in here?

858
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:32,839
- Did you just call Mitch?
- No.

859
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:35,342
Get a unit over
to Brockden's house now.

860
01:14:13,314 --> 01:14:15,015
Rachel! Rach!

861
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:18,619
Oh, somebody!
Somebody help me!

862
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:21,455
<i>- Get up.
- No! Why are you doing this?</i>

863
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,456
- Get up.
- No!

864
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:23,991
<i>Please, don't kill me.</i>

865
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:26,026
<i>- No.
- Don't hurt her!</i>

866
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:28,562
Mitch. Mitch.

867
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:32,266
Toss the gun over here.

868
01:14:36,404 --> 01:14:37,471
Do it.

869
01:14:47,582 --> 01:14:50,984
Now, Rachel,
I want you to bend down

870
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:52,719
take that gun by the barrel

871
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:55,389
and pass it to me.

872
01:14:55,391 --> 01:14:58,025
Whatever you're thinking of
doing, Clinton, don't do it.

873
01:14:58,027 --> 01:15:01,361
Well, it looks like
you just fucked up

874
01:15:01,363 --> 01:15:03,030
our reasonable
doubt here, Mitch.

875
01:15:03,032 --> 01:15:06,066
What happened to your
family was terrible.

876
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:09,703
Doing this, it's--
it's not gonna change that.

877
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:13,040
I was protecting
other people's families.

878
01:15:13,042 --> 01:15:16,009
Who's gonna
protect yours now, Mitch?

879
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:17,444
You?

880
01:15:19,415 --> 01:15:21,048
You understand now?
Do you get it?

881
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:22,316
Yeah, I get it.

882
01:15:23,785 --> 01:15:26,053
I get that you watched
your wife and child

883
01:15:26,055 --> 01:15:28,488
tortured to death
and you did nothing.

884
01:15:29,457 --> 01:15:32,025
I get that you're
a fucking coward.

885
01:15:33,094 --> 01:15:35,329
You froze.

886
01:15:35,331 --> 01:15:38,732
You cared more about saving yourself
than your own flesh and blood.

887
01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:41,568
- Mitch, please don't.
- You think if you take out

888
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:43,870
- as many parolees as possible...
- Shut up.

889
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:46,473
...you'll make what happened
to your family go away.

890
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:50,544
- Please.
- You know, if you were a man...

891
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:54,081
a real man,
you would've died first.

892
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:55,482
I thought I was dead.

893
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:57,918
I was hog-tied
with my throat cut,

894
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,920
but I wasn't so lucky.

895
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:03,490
I had to watch
my loved ones die.

896
01:16:04,559 --> 01:16:06,393
You're not tied up
though, Mitch.

897
01:16:07,562 --> 01:16:09,796
So what are you gonna do, huh?

898
01:16:10,998 --> 01:16:12,933
Are you willing to die first?

899
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:14,368
Yes.

900
01:16:16,437 --> 01:16:18,004
Yes, I am.

901
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:20,407
We'll see about that.

902
01:16:21,676 --> 01:16:23,643
Oh! Mitch! No!

903
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:27,381
You need to understand,

904
01:16:27,383 --> 01:16:29,116
to see someone you love

905
01:16:29,118 --> 01:16:31,418
bleed to death
in front of your eyes.

906
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:34,654
Please. Please don't.

907
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:36,857
<i>- Please don't.
- Begging won't help, Rachel.</i>

908
01:16:36,859 --> 01:16:38,825
My wife begged.

909
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:41,161
It's a waste of time.

910
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:44,698
- Now...
- No! No!

911
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:47,929
Now you're gonna see
what it's like to be me.

912
01:16:47,955 --> 01:16:49,428
Please!

913
01:16:50,471 --> 01:16:52,706
To feel my emptiness,

914
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:54,775
my pain.

915
01:16:58,946 --> 01:17:01,715
I'm gonna give you something
I never had, Mitch.

916
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,821
Prove you can
do better than I did.

917
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:10,023
- Please.
- Go ahead.

918
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:15,495
Save... your family.

919
01:17:16,831 --> 01:17:18,732
Mitch, no!

920
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:23,537
Mitch!

921
01:17:23,539 --> 01:17:24,704
Mitch!

922
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:31,571
Can I help you with anything?

923
01:18:31,573 --> 01:18:33,773
Oh, you're hysterical.

924
01:18:35,643 --> 01:18:37,143
Rach!

925
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:39,579
<i>Rach, he's here.</i>

926
01:18:39,581 --> 01:18:42,048
Give me Ella,
then you can say hello.

927
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,783
- Yeah, I got her.
- I know.

928
01:18:46,522 --> 01:18:50,290
- This is my wife Rachel.
- Hey.

929
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:52,792
This is my brother Jimmy.

930
01:18:52,794 --> 01:18:55,862
- Hello, Jimmy.
- Wow, hi.

931
01:18:57,164 --> 01:18:59,599
- How are you?
- Better than I look.

932
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:01,735
And this...

933
01:19:03,738 --> 01:19:05,672
- Oh Jesus.
- This is your niece...

934
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:07,574
Ella.

935
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:10,277
Oh my God. Hi, Ella.

936
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:13,547
Ella, that's your Uncle Jimmy.

937
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:17,284
Hey, Ella.

938
01:19:17,286 --> 01:19:19,152
Oh my God.

939
01:19:20,087 --> 01:19:21,288
Oh, Mitch.

940
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:23,323
You named her after your ma.

941
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:24,858
Wow.

942
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:34,701
Well, I don't know about you guys,

943
01:19:34,703 --> 01:19:36,636
- but I am freezing.
- Yeah.

944
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:38,772
- Jimmy, wanna come in?
- Yeah, all right. Definitely.

945
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,941
- You okay with her?
- This is terrifying.

946
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:42,642
How do you do this?

947
01:19:45,943 --> 01:19:55,642
