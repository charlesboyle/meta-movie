1
00:02:09,332 --> 00:02:14,754
When the Second World War was over, we
were the one great power in the world.

2
00:02:14,837 --> 00:02:17,924
The Soviets had a substantial
military machine,

3
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:21,427
but they could not
touch us in power.

4
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:24,305
We had this enormous force
that had been built up.

5
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,099
We had the greatest
fleet in the world.

6
00:02:27,183 --> 00:02:31,437
We'd come through the
war economically sound.

7
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:37,360
And I think that, in addition to
feeling a sense of responsibility,

8
00:02:37,443 --> 00:02:40,780
we also began to feel...

9
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:44,450
the-the sense of a world power,

10
00:02:44,534 --> 00:02:49,664
that possibly we could control
the future of the world.

11
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:39,046
Our vision of progress is not
limited to our own country.

12
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,258
We extend it to all the
peoples of the world.

13
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:48,890
Military action in Indochina.

14
00:03:48,973 --> 00:03:52,768
French regulars land along the coast
in search of roving communist bands.

15
00:03:52,894 --> 00:03:56,063
For France, it represents
a tremendous sacrifice...

16
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:58,816
of manpower and
financial resources.

17
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:01,611
Without American help,
the burden would be too great.

18
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:18,586
I do not expect that there is going to
be a communist victory in Indochina.

19
00:04:54,872 --> 00:04:58,376
I affirm that Secretary Dulles...

20
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:02,129
offered me two atomic bombs.

21
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:04,340
Two, uh...

22
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:10,179
Neither one, neither three. Two.

23
00:05:12,306 --> 00:05:17,687
If Indochina goes, several
things happen right away.

24
00:05:17,812 --> 00:05:22,692
The Accra Peninsula, the little bit
of end hanging on down there...

25
00:05:22,817 --> 00:05:25,153
would be scarcely defensible.

26
00:05:25,236 --> 00:05:27,029
The tin and the tungsten...

27
00:05:27,155 --> 00:05:31,117
that we so greatly value from
that area would cease coming.

28
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,494
We don't see the end of the
tunnel, but, uh, I must say...

29
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:37,999
I don't think it's darker than it was a
year ago, in some ways lighter. Yes?

30
00:05:38,082 --> 00:05:41,502
So we must be ready
to fight in Vietnam,

31
00:05:41,586 --> 00:05:45,506
but the ultimate victory
will depend upon the hearts...

32
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:50,344
and the minds of the people
who actually live out there.

33
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,388
Throughout the war in Vietnam,

34
00:05:52,472 --> 00:05:55,766
the United States has exercised
a degree of restraint...

35
00:05:55,892 --> 00:05:58,352
unprecedented in the annals of war.

36
00:07:08,464 --> 00:07:11,926
There was just one thing,

37
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:16,472
one small word that enabled
myself and my buddies...

38
00:07:16,597 --> 00:07:19,475
to stay alive those many years.

39
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:22,436
That one thing was faith.

40
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,441
Faith in my family,
my God and my country.

41
00:07:28,985 --> 00:07:33,156
I remembered high school.
I remembered playing sports there.

42
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:35,741
And I can remember
my coach saying...

43
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:39,287
"When the going gets tough,
the tough get going,

44
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,665
because winners never quit
and quitters never win."

45
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,251
Why did I go to Vietnam?

46
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:50,006
I will have to go back to 1965,
when I was 22 years old.

47
00:07:50,131 --> 00:07:54,302
At that time, communism was once
again trying to muscle its way...

48
00:07:54,385 --> 00:07:56,471
into a free country.

49
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:03,519
That would assert that there's a
majority of people in that country...

50
00:08:03,644 --> 00:08:06,022
that want to be communist.

51
00:08:06,147 --> 00:08:08,274
Why do they need us then?

52
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:14,572
Because they were subjected to,
uh, military attack from outside.

53
00:08:14,697 --> 00:08:18,826
Uh, the, uh...

54
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:22,663
Are you really asking me
this goddamn silly question?

55
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:25,583
- You really want me to go into this?
- Yes.

56
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,836
I mean... I mean, you know,
we really got to go back to...

57
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:31,756
You just want me to go back
to the origins of this thing then.

58
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:36,302
All right, I'll do it, but this is
pretty pedestrian stuff, I must say,

59
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:38,513
at this late stage of the game.

60
00:08:38,638 --> 00:08:40,807
Honestly it is.

61
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,809
I'll do it. All right.

62
00:08:42,892 --> 00:08:45,311
- There's disagreement about the origins.
- No, there's not.

63
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:47,563
No, there's not. There's no doubt.

64
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:51,859
All right, I'll answer your question,
you can throw away that tape.

65
00:08:51,943 --> 00:08:55,780
I didn't expect to have to go back
to this kind of sophomoric stuff,

66
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:58,866
but I'll do it.

67
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:04,539
The problem, uh, began, uh,

68
00:09:04,664 --> 00:09:07,542
in its present phase,
after the Sputnik,

69
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:12,088
the launch of the Sputnik
in 1957, October.

70
00:09:12,171 --> 00:09:16,843
This opened a phase
of not well-coordinated,

71
00:09:16,926 --> 00:09:20,972
but universally optimistic and
hopeful communist enterprise...

72
00:09:21,097 --> 00:09:23,224
in many parts of the world.

73
00:09:23,307 --> 00:09:26,727
Renewed hostile actions...

74
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:31,440
against United States ships on the
high seas in the Gulf of Tonkin...

75
00:09:31,566 --> 00:09:37,280
have today required me to order
military forces of the United States...

76
00:09:37,405 --> 00:09:40,199
to take action in reply.

77
00:09:40,283 --> 00:09:44,871
We always hesitate in public to use
the word "lie" but a lie is a lie.

78
00:09:44,954 --> 00:09:48,416
I mean, it's a
misrepresentation of fact.

79
00:09:48,499 --> 00:09:52,795
And it's supposed to be a criminal
act if its done under oath.

80
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,424
Mr. Johnson didn't say it
under oath, he just said it.

81
00:09:56,549 --> 00:09:59,594
We don't usually have
the president under oath.

82
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:04,974
There are those who ask why this
responsibility should be ours.

83
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:07,810
The answer, I think, is simple.

84
00:10:07,935 --> 00:10:11,314
There is no one else
who can do the job.

85
00:10:11,397 --> 00:10:14,984
If necessary,
I am ready to go back.

86
00:10:15,109 --> 00:10:17,737
We all must be ready.

87
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,408
You must have the political, economic
and philosophical courage to send me...

88
00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:25,161
or do whatever you think
is necessary.

89
00:10:25,286 --> 00:10:28,623
I must be ready to go.
If I did well,

90
00:10:28,706 --> 00:10:31,792
it is only because Linden did
well in bringing me up...

91
00:10:31,918 --> 00:10:35,421
and making me into a man.

92
00:10:35,505 --> 00:10:38,132
If I served the military well,

93
00:10:38,257 --> 00:10:42,178
it is only because the military
trained me to be a good officer.

94
00:10:43,346 --> 00:10:45,640
If I am a good American,

95
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:50,520
it is only because America
brought me up to be a good American.

96
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:55,149
- Three, two, one...

97
00:10:55,274 --> 00:10:57,860
It was a sight to touch
the heart of the most callous.

98
00:10:57,985 --> 00:11:01,864
Lieutenant George Coker was back in
Linden, New Jersey, the hero of the day.

99
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:04,826
Three thousand people turned out
to greet him. Schools were closed...

100
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:07,537
and streets were blocked as the
young former prisoner of war...

101
00:11:07,662 --> 00:11:10,832
walked on a red carpet
to the steps of city hall.

102
00:11:10,957 --> 00:11:14,001
Mike is still open. Two, one...

103
00:11:14,126 --> 00:11:17,713
I'm from Duncan, Oklahoma, which
is about 90 miles south of here.

104
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,300
And, uh, and I lived
around several places...

105
00:11:21,425 --> 00:11:25,847
uh, Missouri, Chicago,
Detroit, uh, Germany,

106
00:11:27,056 --> 00:11:29,809
Uh...

107
00:11:29,892 --> 00:11:32,603
by the time I got out of high
school, I was very conservative.

108
00:11:32,728 --> 00:11:35,439
We have, in Duncan high school...
we bought...

109
00:11:35,565 --> 00:11:38,151
the high school had bought a, uh...

110
00:11:38,234 --> 00:11:40,862
Excuse me...
a John Birch package on communism.

111
00:11:40,945 --> 00:11:43,281
So we studied communism
via the John Birch Society,

112
00:11:43,406 --> 00:11:47,994
the big red map with the flowing
out of the disease and so forth,

113
00:11:48,077 --> 00:11:51,122
and-and learned how Karl Marx
was a very cruel man...

114
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:54,667
and used to, uh, make his
family suffer and so forth.

115
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:59,672
Uh, so when I got out of high school,
I thought basically that, um,

116
00:11:59,755 --> 00:12:01,799
Teddy Roosevelt's
what this country needed,

117
00:12:01,924 --> 00:12:04,844
and F.D.R. had kind of sold us
down the drain to the commies.

118
00:12:04,927 --> 00:12:08,055
The communist conspiracy is a deliberate
and predictable plan of action...

119
00:12:08,181 --> 00:12:10,099
to subvert the world.

120
00:12:10,183 --> 00:12:12,894
Mosinee, Wisconsin,
in a unique Mayday object lesson,

121
00:12:12,977 --> 00:12:16,564
shows what could happen here
if communism took over.

122
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:20,359
The unyielding chief of police is
liquidated by American Legionnaires...

123
00:12:20,443 --> 00:12:22,570
portraying Red trigger men.

124
00:12:24,697 --> 00:12:28,326
A grim demonstration of
what subversion could lead to,

125
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:33,080
Mosinee's Mayday serves as a sharp
warning to all democratic communities.

126
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:37,460
It's an international,
criminal conspiracy.

127
00:12:37,585 --> 00:12:40,421
Before we know it, we're gonna
turn our backs around someday,

128
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:43,549
the whole United States, we're gonna
turn around and see nothing but V. C...

129
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:46,636
or not V.C., but communism... we're gonna
turn around and say, "What happened?"

130
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,263
People just walking in
with riots, drugs, you name it.

131
00:12:49,347 --> 00:12:51,390
They're tearing us down
from the inside out.

132
00:12:51,474 --> 00:12:56,103
In 1917, when the communists
overthrew the Russian government,

133
00:12:56,187 --> 00:13:01,317
there was 1 communist
for every 2,277 persons...

134
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:03,319
in Russia.

135
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:06,239
In the United States today,
there is one communist...

136
00:13:06,322 --> 00:13:11,285
for every 1,814 persons
in this country.

137
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,873
If we lose Indochina, Mr. Jenkins,
we will lose the Pacific,

138
00:13:15,998 --> 00:13:19,460
and we'll be an island
in a communist sea.

139
00:13:19,585 --> 00:13:22,964
- Go ahead, how does it go?
- Oh, mother.

140
00:13:24,757 --> 00:13:26,717
I swear that I am not now...

141
00:13:26,843 --> 00:13:30,680
or ever have been a member
of the communist party.

142
00:13:30,805 --> 00:13:33,266
Feel better?

143
00:13:34,684 --> 00:13:36,769
Of course, when it gets down
to communism, uh,

144
00:13:36,853 --> 00:13:39,689
I've been fighting communism
since 1951, actually.

145
00:13:39,814 --> 00:13:44,694
I was looked at, you know, the American
fighting man, as being, uh, you know,

146
00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:49,574
like a warrior of sorts,
you know, due to my background,

147
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:51,576
the way my mother brought me up.

148
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:55,163
She always spoke of the warrior
societies of our tribe...

149
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:58,457
and of the different tribes around
us and how that these men...

150
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:02,420
always had to work to gain the
respect of the people around them...

151
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:07,008
and how they had to live, uh,
more or less a life dictated to them...

152
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:10,720
by the society that they belonged
to, and it was extremely hard.

153
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:16,142
I-I looked around and from listening to
my uncles and a lot of my relations...

154
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:19,145
they had been in the Marine Corps...
and they always told me that...

155
00:14:19,228 --> 00:14:23,191
the Marine Corps was the hardest service
to cope with physically and mentally.

156
00:14:23,274 --> 00:14:26,110
And I naturally wanted to be
the best at that time,

157
00:14:26,235 --> 00:14:29,530
and I looked at the Marine Corps
as being the elite of the elite,

158
00:14:29,655 --> 00:14:32,033
the warrior society
in the United States.

159
00:14:32,116 --> 00:14:36,871
Now it might sound
cliché-ish to say that,

160
00:14:36,996 --> 00:14:41,417
"My country, may it always be right,
but right or wrong, my country."

161
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:44,545
But that's how I felt back in '67.

162
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,340
And during my senior year,

163
00:14:47,423 --> 00:14:51,719
I said I've got an
obligation to serve.

164
00:14:51,844 --> 00:14:54,222
I've got to fulfill it.

165
00:14:54,305 --> 00:14:58,392
There's no reason physically
why I would be exempted,

166
00:14:58,518 --> 00:15:01,938
and therefore, I'm gonna enlist.

167
00:15:26,254 --> 00:15:28,214
- What you got there?
- Picture.

168
00:15:28,297 --> 00:15:30,216
Picture? How much picture?

169
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:34,095
- Three thousand?
- I go beaucoup hungry. I sell 3,000.

170
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,557
- You go here, too much money.
- I buy watch for 1,500.

171
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,102
No, you sell to me?
You lie. You lie, you die.

172
00:15:41,227 --> 00:15:44,105
- You give massage? What else you give?
- Yes.

173
00:15:44,188 --> 00:15:46,649
Huh?

174
00:15:46,732 --> 00:15:50,278
- I buy you one beer, okay?
- You-You buy me one beer?

175
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:52,613
No, no. No money.
Go home, mama-san.

176
00:15:52,738 --> 00:15:56,617
Please, go home, mama-san.

177
00:15:56,701 --> 00:15:59,579
No. Go home, mama-san.

178
00:15:59,662 --> 00:16:03,499
No. Go home, mama-san.
Okay? No. Go home, mama-san.

179
00:16:03,624 --> 00:16:06,210
- You will like.
- No. No.

180
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,968
Huh?

181
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:16,137
- How much?
- One thousand.

182
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,515
You? Ah, it's too much. Beaucoup.

183
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,685
Yeah, for sure. No, no good.

184
00:17:25,456 --> 00:17:30,503
We thought of ourselves, I think,
as trying to defeat communists.

185
00:17:30,586 --> 00:17:35,299
Defeat... Accepting a view of, uh...
the Walt Rostow kind of view...

186
00:17:35,424 --> 00:17:38,052
of covert aggression of some kind.

187
00:17:38,136 --> 00:17:40,930
The kind of view that enabled you
to think of the conflict...

188
00:17:41,055 --> 00:17:43,015
in, really, World War II terms.

189
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:45,017
That was an unquestioned
assumption.

190
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:47,520
It had an idealistic flavor to it,

191
00:17:47,603 --> 00:17:51,440
but it was the underpinning of
an imperial policy, basically.

192
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:56,779
I shared the assumption, very easily, and
felt it as an idealistic one really.

193
00:17:56,904 --> 00:17:58,781
We were doing something for them.

194
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:02,577
I recall that I was in the
New York area at the time,

195
00:18:02,702 --> 00:18:08,249
and I stopped by to see General MacArthur,
who I had known for several years.

196
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:14,255
Uh, when he greeted me, he made,
uh, quite a prophetic statement.

197
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:20,428
He said, "Westmoreland,
I-I see you have a new job."

198
00:18:21,971 --> 00:18:25,933
He said, "I hope you appreciate
that this new assignment...

199
00:18:27,351 --> 00:18:31,606
is filled with opportunities,
but fraught with hazards."

200
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:35,610
And indeed, uh,
this was a prophetic statement.

201
00:18:56,088 --> 00:18:58,508
It can be described
much like, uh...

202
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:02,970
a-a-a singer doing an aria...

203
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:06,724
that's totally into what he's doing,
you know, totally feeling it.

204
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:09,560
He knows the aria,
and he's experiencing the aria.

205
00:19:09,685 --> 00:19:14,106
And he knows his limits, and he knows
whether he's doing it and doing it well.

206
00:19:14,232 --> 00:19:16,651
Flying an aircraft
can be a great deal like that.

207
00:19:16,734 --> 00:19:18,653
What's a race driver feel like?

208
00:19:18,736 --> 00:19:21,531
Why does a guy want to drive
in the Indianapolis 500?

209
00:19:21,656 --> 00:19:23,991
I guess, perhaps,
the risk of dying,

210
00:19:24,116 --> 00:19:26,327
being killed is part of it
that makes it thrilling.

211
00:19:30,998 --> 00:19:34,627
I can tell when the aircraft feels
right, when it's about to stall.

212
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:38,339
I can tell when I cant
pull another fraction of a pound...

213
00:19:38,464 --> 00:19:41,968
or the airplane will stall,
flip out and spin on me.

214
00:19:42,051 --> 00:19:45,096
I would follow a pathway on something
like a TV screen in front of me...

215
00:19:45,221 --> 00:19:47,640
that would direct me
right, left or center...

216
00:19:47,723 --> 00:19:50,852
follow the steering, keep the
steering symbol, uh, centered.

217
00:19:50,977 --> 00:19:54,438
I'd see a little attack light
when we'd stepped into attack.

218
00:19:54,564 --> 00:19:59,527
I could pull the "commit" switch on
my stick, and the computer took over.

219
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,322
A computer figured out the ballistics,
the airspeed, the slant range...

220
00:20:03,406 --> 00:20:05,491
and dropped the bombs when we
got to the appropriate point,

221
00:20:05,575 --> 00:20:07,702
in whichever kind of attack
we'd selected,

222
00:20:07,785 --> 00:20:11,914
whether it was flying straight and
level or tossing our bombs out.

223
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:15,710
So it was very much of
a technical expertise thing.

224
00:20:15,835 --> 00:20:19,005
I was a good pilot, you know.
I had, uh, uh,

225
00:20:19,088 --> 00:20:21,340
I had a lot of pride
in my ability to fly.

226
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:29,056
You're up there
doing something that, uh,

227
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,728
mankind has only dreamed of; the flying,
especially at night, in an aircraft.

228
00:20:33,811 --> 00:20:37,273
The A-6 is one of the few that can
really do it the way we did it.

229
00:20:37,398 --> 00:20:41,110
Um, a World War II aviator would not
even dream of doing the things we did.

230
00:20:41,235 --> 00:20:43,196
It's definitely
the ultimate in aviation.

231
00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:59,962
Almost everybody
has blown off firecrackers.

232
00:21:00,087 --> 00:21:03,132
The thrill you get when you
see something explode as a child,

233
00:21:03,257 --> 00:21:05,384
or even as an adult almost.

234
00:21:05,468 --> 00:21:08,387
You put something in the can and
watch the can blow up in the air.

235
00:21:14,685 --> 00:21:17,355
And the excitement,
the sense of excitement,

236
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,441
especially if you're getting
shot at, is just incredible.

237
00:21:22,693 --> 00:21:24,987
You get there, have a real
good mission, hit your target,

238
00:21:25,112 --> 00:21:27,657
find out later your target
was totally destroyed,

239
00:21:27,782 --> 00:21:31,118
that it wasn't one of these misses
or almost, you got it.

240
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:36,082
And come back and make a night carrier
landing recovery. Uh, that's fantastic.

241
00:21:36,165 --> 00:21:39,293
To say it's thrilling,
yes, it's deeply satisfying.

242
00:21:53,432 --> 00:21:56,185
The planes again.

243
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:00,148
Are they American or Vietnamese?

244
00:22:00,273 --> 00:22:04,443
I don't know
whose they are. Just airplanes.

245
00:22:07,947 --> 00:22:10,491
What was this here?

246
00:22:10,616 --> 00:22:13,161
I used to raise pigs
here, right there.

247
00:22:15,746 --> 00:22:20,334
Where was the kitchen?

248
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:27,008
The kitchen was here.
They built it with bricks.

249
00:22:27,091 --> 00:22:30,178
This was the floor.
And this was for the heat.

250
00:22:30,261 --> 00:22:32,847
What's that?

251
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,932
That is the bomb crater.

252
00:22:35,057 --> 00:22:38,478
The bombs dropped there
and destroyed everything I had.

253
00:22:43,774 --> 00:22:48,237
An older sister died,
and I've another older sister left.

254
00:22:48,321 --> 00:22:51,324
Yes, there were just the three of us.
But then one died.

255
00:22:51,407 --> 00:22:54,577
And I'm supposed to live
in a house over there.

256
00:22:56,454 --> 00:22:59,373
But now it's just a heap of rubble.

257
00:22:59,457 --> 00:23:03,711
How old was your sister?

258
00:23:03,795 --> 00:23:06,172
Seventy-eight.

259
00:23:06,255 --> 00:23:09,675
What did she die of?

260
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:12,345
Bombs. Bombs were dropped
here the other day,

261
00:23:12,428 --> 00:23:14,430
and they killed her.

262
00:23:24,232 --> 00:23:26,275
I'm so unhappy.

263
00:23:35,368 --> 00:23:38,329
My sister died
and I've got no home left.

264
00:23:38,454 --> 00:23:40,832
I've moved in with my sister here.

265
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:45,711
I've been wounded.

266
00:23:48,381 --> 00:23:53,094
I can't do anything for a living now.
I'm old and weak.

267
00:23:53,177 --> 00:23:57,598
I've got nothing to sell.
Nothing to do.

268
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:25,543
Mm.

269
00:24:31,007 --> 00:24:33,426
You really just don't have
time for personal thoughts...

270
00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:36,971
when you're up there flying around
at 500, 600 miles an hours.

271
00:24:37,054 --> 00:24:39,432
You might call it an electronic war
in a certain way.

272
00:24:39,515 --> 00:24:41,642
I didn't have time to think
about anything else.

273
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:44,979
If you wanted to later, you might.
But it was all business.

274
00:24:45,104 --> 00:24:47,398
It's, um, just strictly
professionalism.

275
00:24:47,523 --> 00:24:49,817
We had a job to do and we did it.

276
00:24:49,942 --> 00:24:53,070
Never could see the people.
You never could see...

277
00:24:53,196 --> 00:24:56,199
Occasionally you saw the houses when
you were bombing around a village...

278
00:24:56,324 --> 00:24:58,367
or bombing in a village.

279
00:24:58,493 --> 00:25:00,745
Uh, you never heard the explosion.

280
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:04,165
You never saw any blood or any screams.
It was very clean.

281
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,502
You're doing a job.

282
00:25:07,627 --> 00:25:10,004
You're an expert at what you do.

283
00:25:13,466 --> 00:25:15,593
I was a technician.

284
00:25:20,515 --> 00:25:23,476
Everything just
collapsed under the bombs.

285
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:25,561
Everything just caved in.

286
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:34,237
It's like a bird and its nest.

287
00:25:35,738 --> 00:25:38,574
The way things are
with the house in the rubble,

288
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:43,746
the bird comes home
and finds no nest.

289
00:25:43,871 --> 00:25:47,875
Where am I to find a place to sit
and work for something to eat?

290
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,712
Even a bird needs a nest
it can go back to,

291
00:25:51,838 --> 00:25:54,465
crawl into for sleep and food.

292
00:26:17,113 --> 00:26:19,782
Look, they're focusing on us now.

293
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:27,123
First they bomb as much as
they please, then they film.

294
00:26:36,883 --> 00:26:40,803
We fought against the
Chinese for 12 centuries.

295
00:26:40,887 --> 00:26:43,514
We fought against the French
for 100 years.

296
00:26:47,935 --> 00:26:51,522
And finally, when the war
was lost by the French in 1954...

297
00:26:51,647 --> 00:26:53,941
at the battle of Dien Bien Phu,

298
00:26:54,066 --> 00:26:57,236
the Vietnamese were liberated
from foreign oppression.

299
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:07,288
But it was at that precise moment
that the Americans came to Vietnam.

300
00:27:07,413 --> 00:27:11,793
Little by little at first.
Then more and more as an invasion,

301
00:27:11,876 --> 00:27:14,295
an invasion of the American army.

302
00:27:17,423 --> 00:27:20,343
Five hundred thousand of them
in Vietnam.

303
00:27:20,468 --> 00:27:24,263
And this war
became a war of genocide.

304
00:27:24,347 --> 00:27:27,642
The people of North Vietnam
and South Vietnam...

305
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:32,814
fight only for freedom,
independence and national unity.

306
00:27:34,857 --> 00:27:39,987
This war is a war against
the American imperialists.

307
00:27:40,112 --> 00:27:43,449
This is our war for independence.

308
00:27:54,502 --> 00:27:58,714
What we are trying to put across this
afternoon is to get you to realize...

309
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,676
that these weren't mythical,
hazy people from the past.

310
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:04,011
These were very real people.

311
00:28:04,095 --> 00:28:07,932
When they rose up against the
most powerful army in the world,

312
00:28:08,057 --> 00:28:11,018
they were actually putting everything
on the line that they had:

313
00:28:11,102 --> 00:28:15,189
Their homes, their wealth,
their past and their future.

314
00:28:17,942 --> 00:28:20,319
That all men are created equal.

315
00:28:20,403 --> 00:28:24,532
That they are endowed by their creator
with certain unalienable rights.

316
00:28:24,657 --> 00:28:30,079
That among these are life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness."

317
00:28:30,204 --> 00:28:32,665
And when you judge the Revolution
and the problems and the success we had,

318
00:28:32,748 --> 00:28:34,667
it was a two-way street.

319
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,879
A good many citizens
at the time of the Revolution...

320
00:28:38,004 --> 00:28:40,590
actually stayed
and fought with the British.

321
00:28:40,715 --> 00:28:42,717
It was close to being a civil war
in many areas.

322
00:28:42,842 --> 00:28:45,511
You actually split
many-many families.

323
00:28:45,595 --> 00:28:48,389
Thomas Jefferson said,
"The tree of revolution is..."

324
00:28:48,514 --> 00:28:50,433
or "The tree of liberty is...

325
00:28:50,516 --> 00:28:53,936
watered by the blood of revolution
every generation."

326
00:28:54,061 --> 00:28:58,441
And I think that's a little exaggerated,
but there's some truth to that.

327
00:28:58,566 --> 00:29:00,985
The war had come
to Westchester County,

328
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:05,448
but so too had independence
and a new responsibility.

329
00:29:05,573 --> 00:29:08,618
Men are getting killed, men are
killing. That's the parallel.

330
00:29:08,743 --> 00:29:11,329
As far as politics,
are you kidding?

331
00:29:11,454 --> 00:29:14,123
Oriental politics?
Don't put me on, man.

332
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:16,959
Fire!

333
00:29:18,878 --> 00:29:21,923
We haven't found his weapon yet.
We're still looking for it.

334
00:29:22,006 --> 00:29:23,925
- You got a weapon?
- No, sir.

335
00:29:24,008 --> 00:29:25,927
He had one, man.
This guy's got ammo.

336
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,763
I'm planning to medivac this guy.

337
00:29:34,435 --> 00:29:36,979
The people who are
living in the jungle,

338
00:29:37,104 --> 00:29:41,275
under the bombs, without pay,
without their families,

339
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,654
are doing so because they are
fighting for independence.

340
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:47,073
Because they're fighting, in
this case, for unification...

341
00:29:47,156 --> 00:29:49,283
and they're fighting
for revolution.

342
00:29:56,415 --> 00:30:01,420
Of course, the name
for a conflict...

343
00:30:01,546 --> 00:30:05,049
in which you're opposing a
revolution is counter-revolution.

344
00:30:05,174 --> 00:30:07,718
And this is something we never
admitted to ourselves at all.

345
00:30:07,844 --> 00:30:09,804
It's-It's what we
were really doing.

346
00:30:09,887 --> 00:30:13,516
The letters and the
reports we had...

347
00:30:13,641 --> 00:30:17,103
on Ho Chi Minh's attitude
back in 1946...

348
00:30:17,228 --> 00:30:21,607
he wrote I think it was seven letters to
this government and received no reply.

349
00:30:21,691 --> 00:30:26,821
The-The-The pathos, almost,
the sadness...

350
00:30:26,904 --> 00:30:30,324
Here's a man who felt
and believed the United States...

351
00:30:30,408 --> 00:30:33,744
would be sympathetic to his purpose
of gaining his independence...

352
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,746
from a colonial power.

353
00:30:35,872 --> 00:30:39,000
And then to find we...
You know, this is what he'd read.

354
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:42,587
He'd been here, read our Constitution
and Declaration of Independence.

355
00:30:42,712 --> 00:30:45,715
He thought surely the United States
would be interested.

356
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,342
We had testimony in the
committee that his one worry...

357
00:30:48,468 --> 00:30:50,344
was that it was so insignificant...

358
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:54,640
Vietnam was so far away, insignificant...
we would never bother about it.

359
00:30:54,724 --> 00:30:59,645
It's too small to ever attract the
attention of the United States.

360
00:30:59,729 --> 00:31:01,647
He was sure in his own mind...

361
00:31:01,731 --> 00:31:04,567
that if we ever put our minds in
focus upon it, we would be for him.

362
00:31:04,692 --> 00:31:09,155
How different history would have
been for us and for them...

363
00:31:09,238 --> 00:31:12,158
if we had felt a common interest...

364
00:31:12,241 --> 00:31:15,411
in the colonial province
like Vietnam...

365
00:31:15,536 --> 00:31:17,497
seeking its independence
from France.

366
00:31:18,706 --> 00:31:20,583
The Ho Chi Minh of '56,

367
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:23,878
I don't think could have got elected
dogcatcher in South Vietnam.

368
00:31:24,003 --> 00:31:28,716
Ho Chi Minh, uh, dead...

369
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,011
Could beat any candidate
we've ever put up in Vietnam.

370
00:31:34,806 --> 00:31:38,601
You asked me about
my oldest son Bing.

371
00:31:38,726 --> 00:31:43,397
He was a graduate of Harvard, 1965.

372
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:46,400
And he was not a soldier at heart.

373
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:50,571
Uh, but he realized,
I'm sure, there's no question,

374
00:31:50,696 --> 00:31:56,410
he realized he was part of a
big job that had to be done,

375
00:31:56,536 --> 00:32:00,957
and he was gonna do it the way
he did everything... full out.

376
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,418
And he went out on this mission...
Minh River...

377
00:32:04,544 --> 00:32:07,463
and it was a big assault mission
bringing elements...

378
00:32:07,588 --> 00:32:11,801
to this area just south of Da Nang
along the railroad line.

379
00:32:11,926 --> 00:32:16,848
And they encountered heavy, sustained,
uh, automatic weapons fire.

380
00:32:16,973 --> 00:32:20,977
And the helicopter ahead of him,
I believe,

381
00:32:21,102 --> 00:32:25,356
was, uh, uh, destr...
was shot down.

382
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:30,736
And then he went in
and his helicopter was, uh, uh...

383
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:35,783
He was actually killed in flight.
That's what they...

384
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:39,579
And the airplane crashed,
and he and his co... He was killed.

385
00:32:39,662 --> 00:32:42,331
His copilot was very badly injured.

386
00:32:42,457 --> 00:32:46,919
And I think there were 12 out of
15 or 16 of the people aboard...

387
00:32:47,003 --> 00:32:49,255
were either killed or badly hurt.

388
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,314
Many bombs, many coffins.

389
00:33:07,648 --> 00:33:09,692
These are for children.

390
00:33:12,528 --> 00:33:16,824
Eight or nine hundred a week.
I have lost seven children myself.

391
00:33:19,327 --> 00:33:22,288
Many have died here.

392
00:33:22,371 --> 00:33:27,251
It's nothing like in the countryside.
Many more have died there.

393
00:33:31,297 --> 00:33:36,135
In the country, there are no coffins.
There's no money to buy them.

394
00:33:39,972 --> 00:33:41,933
How did all the children die?

395
00:33:44,435 --> 00:33:48,648
Poison. Poison, you know.

396
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:58,324
These planes keep spouting and spraying
the stuff, and so many people have died.

397
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:03,371
It seems to destroy
their intestines.

398
00:34:03,454 --> 00:34:07,375
With this spraying and bombing,
so many have died.

399
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:14,590
Each day, right on time,
the bomb craters appear.

400
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,640
Hundreds of tons
are dropped each day.

401
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,818
And we can't talk about it.
We can't talk about it...

402
00:34:33,943 --> 00:34:36,445
because we are afraid
of the government.

403
00:34:55,131 --> 00:34:57,675
Come on.

404
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:09,103
- You look nice.
- How do you feel?

405
00:35:09,187 --> 00:35:11,105
What'd you do?

406
00:35:11,189 --> 00:35:13,608
Uh, shaved.

407
00:35:13,733 --> 00:35:15,818
I liked it better long.

408
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,323
So what you been doing?

409
00:35:23,117 --> 00:35:25,161
In little more than a week,

410
00:35:25,286 --> 00:35:28,456
I'll be going back to the military.

411
00:35:28,539 --> 00:35:31,459
You what?

412
00:35:31,542 --> 00:35:34,295
- Why?
- Well...

413
00:35:37,089 --> 00:35:40,051
After what they've done to you?

414
00:35:42,136 --> 00:35:44,806
Well, it's...

415
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:47,308
it's a choice between that...

416
00:35:48,976 --> 00:35:52,438
or, uh, Canada, again.

417
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:57,151
Or, uh, staying underground.

418
00:35:58,361 --> 00:36:00,988
Which is, uh, as you know,
impossible...

419
00:36:01,113 --> 00:36:04,033
- Have you been in contact with them?
- No.

420
00:36:04,158 --> 00:36:06,410
No. But I've got a lot of support.

421
00:36:06,536 --> 00:36:08,412
You'll get the same deal
Mike's getting.

422
00:36:08,538 --> 00:36:12,333
It's going to be a different type thing.
I'm going back publicly.

423
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:16,337
We're having, uh,
Ad Hoc Congressional Hearings.

424
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,380
Yeah?

425
00:36:17,505 --> 00:36:19,865
It's really been building up
over the past couple of months.

426
00:36:19,924 --> 00:36:24,303
- And...
- Am I going to be able to be there?

427
00:36:24,387 --> 00:36:28,474
Of course you're going to be there. I'm
gonna try to get Ronnie there, too.

428
00:36:28,558 --> 00:36:30,810
"Cause you know what
I feel about the army.

429
00:36:30,893 --> 00:36:35,189
These people holding their heads
high because they lost a son...

430
00:36:35,273 --> 00:36:37,191
in Vietnam or something.

431
00:36:37,275 --> 00:36:39,694
I don't think
that's much to be proud of.

432
00:36:42,321 --> 00:36:46,033
They've lost more than they'll ever
gain for the rest of their lives.

433
00:36:49,871 --> 00:36:53,875
And I remember I was sitting
at the base of the hill,

434
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,669
and I was on one of the tanks.

435
00:36:56,752 --> 00:36:59,839
And I had an M-16,
and I had stacks of magazines.

436
00:36:59,922 --> 00:37:02,133
And there were two guys, you know,

437
00:37:02,258 --> 00:37:06,262
that were going through,
like, some grass and bam!

438
00:37:06,387 --> 00:37:09,432
I dinged in on one of 'em,
and I nailed him, you know.

439
00:37:09,557 --> 00:37:14,228
And the Aussie with me confirmed,
you know, that I dinged him.

440
00:37:14,312 --> 00:37:17,023
And I felt good. And I wanted more.

441
00:37:17,106 --> 00:37:22,111
And it wasn't that I wanted more
for politics or anything like that.

442
00:37:22,236 --> 00:37:25,865
No. I couldn't of cared
if they were whatever.

443
00:37:25,948 --> 00:37:30,411
I just wanted them because they
were the opposition, the enemy.

444
00:37:30,495 --> 00:37:34,123
Stinking little savages.
Wipe 'em out, I say.

445
00:37:34,248 --> 00:37:37,043
Wipe 'em out.
Wipe 'em off the face of the earth!

446
00:37:38,294 --> 00:37:40,755
Will we ever understand
these Eastern races?

447
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,132
Hit me, Poon Soon.

448
00:37:47,261 --> 00:37:49,096
You hideous yellow monster!

449
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:52,642
I wanted to go out
and kill some gooks, you know?

450
00:37:52,725 --> 00:37:57,480
I-I really... I-I don't know. I guess
I had been totally brainwashed,

451
00:37:57,605 --> 00:38:01,108
because I could remember when people
used to call me "blanket ass"...

452
00:38:01,234 --> 00:38:03,486
or "chief"
and they still did, you know?

453
00:38:03,611 --> 00:38:07,406
I think my name was, uh,
Ira Hayes in boot camp.

454
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:11,410
Either Ira Hayes or squaw, depending on
what mood the drill instructor was in.

455
00:38:11,494 --> 00:38:14,789
But there I was, you know, saying
I wanted to go kill some gooks.

456
00:38:14,914 --> 00:38:19,794
They were instructed to remove
the eyes of the individual...

457
00:38:19,877 --> 00:38:22,505
and place them in a hole
in the middle of the back,

458
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,299
and that would say to the
Vietnamese, you have to understand,

459
00:38:25,383 --> 00:38:28,261
uh, that whoever did that
was ubiquitous.

460
00:38:28,344 --> 00:38:30,972
In other words, the eye being
the symbol of ubiquity,

461
00:38:31,097 --> 00:38:34,809
uh, or of all-present, all-powerfulness
on the part of the Saigon government.

462
00:38:34,934 --> 00:38:39,063
Which is an easy message
for the local villagers to get.

463
00:38:39,188 --> 00:38:42,068
In fact, the American advisors didn't
have that much of a stomach for it.

464
00:38:42,191 --> 00:38:45,862
So they used to use CBS logos.

465
00:38:45,987 --> 00:38:47,947
You know, the eye of CBS?

466
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,671
And they would kill the individual
and then they would leave him...

467
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,660
with kind of a calling card on him.

468
00:38:52,785 --> 00:38:56,831
At one point, I was invited to go
along on an airborne interrogation...

469
00:38:56,956 --> 00:38:59,625
in a helicopter with the marines
northwest of Da Nang.

470
00:38:59,709 --> 00:39:02,003
And they took along two Vietnamese.

471
00:39:02,128 --> 00:39:05,923
And one was already reduced
by beatings with a rubber hose...

472
00:39:06,048 --> 00:39:09,177
and some other methods
of, uh, beating and torture...

473
00:39:09,302 --> 00:39:11,679
to the point where he couldn't
talk, he couldn't respond.

474
00:39:11,804 --> 00:39:16,225
As an example to the one they
wanted to question, they'd say,

475
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,311
"If you don't tell us
what we want to know,

476
00:39:18,394 --> 00:39:20,396
we're gonna throw you
out of the helicopter."

477
00:39:20,521 --> 00:39:23,274
And, uh, he couldn't respond.
He didn't understand.

478
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:26,819
They were using, uh, pigeon Vietnamese,
which he didn't understand.

479
00:39:26,903 --> 00:39:28,821
It was more English
than Vietnamese.

480
00:39:28,905 --> 00:39:31,657
They'd run him up to the helicopter...
two hefty E.M. were along...

481
00:39:31,741 --> 00:39:36,204
they'd take him by each elbow and run
him up to the door of the helicopter.

482
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:39,707
They'd do this three or four times.
He was reduced to whimpering and crying.

483
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:44,128
And they finally, um, uh, told
him that this was the last run.

484
00:39:44,253 --> 00:39:47,965
He still responded the same way, and
they winged him out of the helicopter.

485
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:52,386
The second fellow
immediately started to babble.

486
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,388
Anything he could tell them.

487
00:39:54,472 --> 00:39:57,767
Any kind of information
he could give them for one goal.

488
00:39:57,892 --> 00:40:00,019
And that was to reach the ground
alive again.

489
00:40:00,102 --> 00:40:03,356
I just can't see in my mind somebody
throwing somebody out of a helicopter.

490
00:40:03,439 --> 00:40:07,193
I don't believe this kind of stuff
happened. Maybe it did. I don't know.

491
00:40:07,276 --> 00:40:09,403
I never saw it, put it that way.

492
00:40:11,155 --> 00:40:16,619
I've seen G.I.'s get mad and, uh, uh,
rather than shoot one of these dinks,

493
00:40:16,744 --> 00:40:20,456
uh, just punch him right out, yeah,
with his hands.

494
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,837
Americans say Vietnamese are
just slant-eyed savages.

495
00:40:25,962 --> 00:40:28,798
The Vietnamese have
5,000 years of history.

496
00:40:28,923 --> 00:40:33,719
We fight against the invaders.
It is not we who are the savages.

497
00:40:49,652 --> 00:40:51,821
I don't know where they are.
That's the worst thing.

498
00:40:51,946 --> 00:40:54,824
Right around and run into the sewers
and the gutters, anywhere.

499
00:40:54,949 --> 00:40:58,369
They can be anywhere. Just hopin'
you can stay alive from day to day.

500
00:40:58,494 --> 00:41:01,539
I just want to go back home
and go to school. That's about it.

501
00:41:01,664 --> 00:41:03,624
- Have you lost any friends?
- Quite a few.

502
00:41:03,749 --> 00:41:08,045
We lost one the other day.
The whole thing stinks.

503
00:41:12,341 --> 00:41:14,927
The dude in the foxhole with me,
he was dead.

504
00:41:15,011 --> 00:41:19,724
And, like, here come the jets.
Everybody's, "Yay, jets! Do it to 'em.

505
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:22,059
Get these motherfuckers
off our ass." You know.

506
00:41:22,185 --> 00:41:24,604
'Cause they were diggin'
in our behind real good.

507
00:41:24,687 --> 00:41:28,024
And, like, the jet came in
and "Yay, jet, get 'em."

508
00:41:28,149 --> 00:41:30,860
And you see 'em swoopin' all around.
"Yay, jet, get 'em."

509
00:41:30,985 --> 00:41:34,238
And he came over that way and let
it go, and you say, "Uh-oh."

510
00:41:34,363 --> 00:41:37,492
And you could see it's napalm
cannister, because you can tell 'em.

511
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:41,454
They spin asshole over head, backwards
as they're tumbling through the air.

512
00:41:41,537 --> 00:41:45,124
And the thing is just tumbling down.
You know it's coming right at you.

513
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:48,669
You know. And, like, wow. The
napalm hit, I grabbed this dude,

514
00:41:48,795 --> 00:41:51,297
just put him up over my head
in the hole like that.

515
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:55,218
Fuckin' napalm went down the whole line.
Just creamed everybody in the line.

516
00:41:55,343 --> 00:41:58,846
Thirty-five dudes, man, just burnt.
Post-toasty to the bitter, you dig?

517
00:41:58,971 --> 00:42:01,432
And that napalm was just drippin'
on both sides of this dude.

518
00:42:01,557 --> 00:42:04,268
He's dead, you know. I'm just holdin'
him up, using him as a shield.

519
00:42:04,393 --> 00:42:07,522
I just chunked this dude off of me
and just sprung out of the hole.

520
00:42:07,605 --> 00:42:10,149
I didn't know which way I was going
outside of back, you dig?

521
00:42:10,274 --> 00:42:12,193
And just ran through.
Burned my pants off.

522
00:42:12,276 --> 00:42:15,822
Spent the rest of the battle running
with no drawers. My stuff hanging out.

523
00:42:15,905 --> 00:42:18,825
You ever try to fight a battle
without any drawers on, man?

524
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:23,996
Awful sick of it.
I'll be so glad to go home.

525
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,876
I don't know. It's the worst area we've
been in since I've been in Vietnam.

526
00:42:29,001 --> 00:42:31,087
You think it's worth it?

527
00:42:31,212 --> 00:42:35,675
Yeah. I don't know. They say we're
fighting for something. I don't know.

528
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,429
I was at a very kind of
sobering thing last night.

529
00:42:40,555 --> 00:42:43,391
Memorial service for four men
in the second squadron...

530
00:42:43,516 --> 00:42:45,476
who were killed the other day.

531
00:42:45,601 --> 00:42:47,770
One of them being a medic.

532
00:42:47,895 --> 00:42:50,481
And, uh, the place was just packed.

533
00:42:50,606 --> 00:42:53,568
And we sang three hymns
and had a nice prayer.

534
00:42:53,651 --> 00:42:57,530
I turned around, looked at
their faces, and they were...

535
00:42:57,613 --> 00:43:02,869
I was just proud.
My-My, uh, feeling for America...

536
00:43:02,952 --> 00:43:05,079
just soared because of their...

537
00:43:05,163 --> 00:43:07,457
The way they looked.
They looked determined...

538
00:43:07,582 --> 00:43:10,585
and-and-and reverent
at the same time.

539
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:15,131
But still they're
a bloody good bunch of killers.

540
00:43:16,632 --> 00:43:20,094
"When you go forth to war
against your enemies...

541
00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:25,057
and see horses and chariots
in an army larger than your own,

542
00:43:25,141 --> 00:43:28,436
you shall not be afraid."

543
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:32,064
Well, let's not anybody
be so naive as to think we're here,

544
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:35,276
in any way, to worship football.

545
00:43:36,777 --> 00:43:41,032
Nor are we here,
as I'm sure many people believe,

546
00:43:41,157 --> 00:43:44,076
to pray for a victory.

547
00:43:45,328 --> 00:43:47,497
We believe in victory.

548
00:43:47,622 --> 00:43:50,458
We believe it will come to the team
that's best prepared.

549
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:54,086
This is serious business
that we're involved in.

550
00:43:54,212 --> 00:43:57,840
And that's religious,
and God cares.

551
00:43:57,965 --> 00:44:02,053
There are going to
be men made tonight.

552
00:44:02,178 --> 00:44:05,139
And that's religious,
and God cares about that.

553
00:44:08,935 --> 00:44:11,604
We're concerned about the big game.

554
00:44:13,314 --> 00:44:15,483
But we're also concerned
about the bigger game,

555
00:44:15,608 --> 00:44:20,112
the biggest game of all that
surrounds us: The game of life.

556
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,659
May you be winners.

557
00:44:24,784 --> 00:44:27,161
Winners in the big game.

558
00:44:27,245 --> 00:44:31,999
But even more importantly,
winners in the biggest game of all,

559
00:44:32,125 --> 00:44:35,503
which we all play. Let us pray.

560
00:44:39,674 --> 00:44:41,008
That's a touchdown.

561
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:48,307
Because we got our kids
geared to crack like hell.

562
00:44:54,647 --> 00:44:59,152
Holding, number 37.

563
00:45:11,664 --> 00:45:14,167
You got to tell them
they're number one, no matter what.

564
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:17,462
- You're number one.

565
00:45:17,587 --> 00:45:21,507
Wow. Why don't you just say "wow"?

566
00:45:21,591 --> 00:45:25,094
- Say what?
- 'Toy hoy" means "wow"?

567
00:45:25,219 --> 00:45:27,096
- Toy hoy?
- Yeah.

568
00:45:27,221 --> 00:45:31,058
Like, toy hoy means,
like, wow, you know?

569
00:45:31,142 --> 00:45:33,895
- Look at the hickeys I gave this chick.
- You gave her hickeys?

570
00:45:33,978 --> 00:45:36,022
- Yeah.
- I can imagine. Where?

571
00:45:36,105 --> 00:45:39,901
Uh, one on each side.

572
00:45:40,026 --> 00:45:43,863
- It's a place where she can't hide 'em.
- Oh, really?

573
00:45:43,946 --> 00:45:47,241
See, this one? I gave her this one.

574
00:45:47,325 --> 00:45:49,327
And this one,
this is the first one right there.

575
00:45:49,452 --> 00:45:52,163
It came out kind of
nasty, you know.

576
00:45:52,288 --> 00:45:55,124
- And... No can do, I know.
- Maybe he's dead.

577
00:45:55,249 --> 00:45:58,085
- He's not dead. Wake him up.
- No can wakey up.

578
00:45:58,211 --> 00:46:00,546
Why?

579
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:04,300
- Wakey him up. He no hard.
- Huh? Why he's no hard?

580
00:46:04,425 --> 00:46:06,302
- Uh-huh.
- 'Cause you no wake him up.

581
00:46:06,427 --> 00:46:09,639
Hey, Charles.
You getting anything out of yours?

582
00:46:09,764 --> 00:46:14,435
This one's, uh, kind of sour on me,
you know? Uh...

583
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,230
- Well, keep her going, man.
- Huh?

584
00:46:17,313 --> 00:46:20,149
- Keep her going.
- I'm trying to.

585
00:46:20,274 --> 00:46:22,944
You know what it is about
these chicks down here,

586
00:46:23,069 --> 00:46:27,073
like, they're, uh...
Well, what would you want to do...

587
00:46:27,198 --> 00:46:29,492
except for, you know,
have a ball with them.

588
00:46:29,617 --> 00:46:32,537
- And, uh... Right?
- Right.

589
00:46:32,662 --> 00:46:34,622
You're number one.

590
00:46:34,705 --> 00:46:37,458
This one's got
a set of knockers, man.

591
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:40,002
This one does, too, but she
won't take her goddamn bra off.

592
00:46:40,128 --> 00:46:41,087
Take it off for her.

593
00:46:41,212 --> 00:46:43,131
Take it off for her?

594
00:46:43,214 --> 00:46:45,925
- That's the name of the game.
- Here, you don't want this.

595
00:46:46,008 --> 00:46:49,011
I know. I know what you want.

596
00:46:49,137 --> 00:46:51,597
- Hey. Hey, Charles. Charles.
- What?

597
00:46:51,722 --> 00:46:54,892
Yeah? It's about time.

598
00:46:58,479 --> 00:47:00,356
Ah, you don't be mad at me, okay?

599
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:02,859
It took you long enough,
you know that?

600
00:47:11,033 --> 00:47:14,537
- Oh, yeah. Check it out, baby.
- Check it out later, man.

601
00:47:14,662 --> 00:47:16,956
Check it out later? Mm!

602
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:35,683
You know, if my chick at home could
see this now, man, she'd flip.

603
00:48:05,963 --> 00:48:09,383
One more. Yeah, this man here.

604
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:21,229
Hurry up down that tunnel.

605
00:48:21,312 --> 00:48:23,606
Let's make a quick
check and let's go.

606
00:48:32,782 --> 00:48:35,618
Okay, well, hurry it up
and check it out quickly.

607
00:49:22,498 --> 00:49:24,375
Some people enjoy it, some don't.

608
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:28,796
Some just go out and do it as a job.
It's a daily grind.

609
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,924
- What is it for you?
- I enjoy it.

610
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:47,899
Now I know that he will have a very
important message for each one of us,

611
00:49:48,024 --> 00:49:51,235
so I want you all
to listen very attentively...

612
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,113
to what he has to say to you.

613
00:49:54,197 --> 00:49:56,741
- Lieutenant Coker.
- If you ever have to go to a war,

614
00:49:56,866 --> 00:50:00,495
and unfortunately, someday you
probably will have to fight a war,

615
00:50:01,829 --> 00:50:05,166
you'll find out
that life becomes very simple.

616
00:50:05,249 --> 00:50:09,545
Because the only thing you're
concerned about is living and dying.

617
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:15,676
Everything else is unimportant, because
suddenly your life is at stake.

618
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,056
And that's what it's like to be
when you become a prisoner,

619
00:50:20,181 --> 00:50:22,350
particularly, a prisoner of war.

620
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:25,686
Because the thing that got us through
were the things we learned...

621
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:28,815
before we were ten years old.

622
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:31,192
I'd like to open up
to questions now.

623
00:50:31,275 --> 00:50:34,654
Just raise your hand or yell it out and
you can ask any question you want.

624
00:50:34,737 --> 00:50:37,573
And I'll do the best I can
to answer them.

625
00:50:39,117 --> 00:50:42,161
How did you feel when
the Vietnam war was over?

626
00:50:42,245 --> 00:50:44,956
How did I feel
when the war was over?

627
00:50:45,081 --> 00:50:47,792
I felt real good. Real good.

628
00:50:47,917 --> 00:50:51,420
It was a long war and a very
difficult war to understand.

629
00:50:51,546 --> 00:50:55,591
But the reason we went there
was to win this war.

630
00:50:55,716 --> 00:50:59,095
I volunteered to go.
I'd go again if I had to.

631
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:02,306
And we wanted to win.
That was our number one ambition.

632
00:51:02,431 --> 00:51:04,851
That's what we really wanted,
was to win this war.

633
00:51:04,934 --> 00:51:08,437
And it took us a long time.
So when we knew that we had won,

634
00:51:08,563 --> 00:51:11,524
we felt great;
we really felt great.

635
00:51:11,649 --> 00:51:16,028
- What did Vietnam look like?
- What did Vietnam look like.

636
00:51:16,112 --> 00:51:19,615
Well, if it wasn't for the people,
it was very pretty.

637
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,909
Uh, the people over there are
very backward and very primitive.

638
00:51:22,034 --> 00:51:24,245
And they just make a mess
out of everything.

639
00:51:26,164 --> 00:51:28,332
How did you... How did you, um...

640
00:51:28,458 --> 00:51:30,918
What do you feel about
the people that, um,

641
00:51:31,002 --> 00:51:34,005
went and burned their draft cards
and went into Canada?

642
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:37,425
We don't agree with them. I think
these people were legally wrong.

643
00:51:37,508 --> 00:51:40,553
I think sometimes
they were cowards.

644
00:51:40,636 --> 00:51:44,140
If they wanted to leave
and go to Canada, that's okay.

645
00:51:44,265 --> 00:51:47,185
But they can't come back, though,
because they have disagreed.

646
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:50,438
They say, "We don't like your
country, we don't like your people."

647
00:51:50,521 --> 00:51:52,440
They're saying that to you and me.

648
00:51:52,523 --> 00:51:54,442
"I don't like you, so I'm leaving."

649
00:51:54,525 --> 00:51:58,529
Well, fine, that's okay. There's
no reason to hate a guy for that.

650
00:51:58,654 --> 00:52:02,283
'Cause that's also his right,
but he can't come back.

651
00:52:02,366 --> 00:52:06,078
Instead of helping and aiding
the Vietnamese people,

652
00:52:06,162 --> 00:52:10,917
I saw that we were party to their
deliberate and systematic destruction.

653
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,422
The Vietnamese were considered,
less than humans, inferiors.

654
00:52:16,506 --> 00:52:19,801
We called them "gooks," "slopes."

655
00:52:19,926 --> 00:52:23,471
Their lives weren't worth anything to us
because we'd been taught to believe...

656
00:52:23,596 --> 00:52:26,682
that they were all fanatical
and that they were all V. C...

657
00:52:26,808 --> 00:52:29,477
or V.C. sympathizers,
even the children.

658
00:52:29,602 --> 00:52:31,479
Many of us, however,
began to understand...

659
00:52:31,604 --> 00:52:34,106
through our personal
experiences in Vietnam...

660
00:52:34,232 --> 00:52:37,819
the depth of the lies and
deceptions practiced upon us,

661
00:52:37,944 --> 00:52:41,447
and the American people,
by our country's leaders.

662
00:52:41,531 --> 00:52:44,700
It was they who trained us
to kill without question...

663
00:52:44,826 --> 00:52:47,912
and to hate our enemy...
the Vietnamese.

664
00:52:48,037 --> 00:52:52,458
They concocted such phrases
as "kill ratios", "search and destroy",

665
00:52:52,542 --> 00:52:56,587
"free fire zones",
"secure areas", and so on...

666
00:52:56,712 --> 00:53:01,717
to mask the reality
of their combat policy in Vietnam.

667
00:53:01,843 --> 00:53:04,679
I make no apology
for this act of resistance.

668
00:53:04,804 --> 00:53:07,515
I could do nothing else
at the time.

669
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,560
But underground life
has become intolerable to me.

670
00:53:10,685 --> 00:53:16,107
So I'm here today to draw attention
to the true facts concerning my case...

671
00:53:16,232 --> 00:53:20,027
and the cases of tens of thousands
just like me.

672
00:53:20,111 --> 00:53:23,406
We are not criminals
to be hunted and imprisoned.

673
00:53:23,531 --> 00:53:29,036
Over a half million of us have
deserted the military since 1965.

674
00:53:29,162 --> 00:53:31,539
Most of us have already returned
to the military...

675
00:53:31,664 --> 00:53:34,167
to be punished with jail
and bad discharges...

676
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:37,420
that will be carried around
for the rest of our lives.

677
00:53:37,545 --> 00:53:41,883
And it is a supreme irony to be
prosecuted by the very same men...

678
00:53:42,008 --> 00:53:46,053
who planned and executed
a genocidal war in Indochina.

679
00:53:46,179 --> 00:53:50,057
Now, inside this hearing room,
Eddie Sowders has surrendered himself.

680
00:53:50,183 --> 00:53:54,103
Urged on, he says, by a hand-to-mouth
underground existence...

681
00:53:54,228 --> 00:53:57,440
that still nags at many
of his fellow deserters...

682
00:53:57,565 --> 00:53:59,734
who continue to look
over their shoulders.

683
00:53:59,817 --> 00:54:02,695
Paul Udell, NBC News, Washington.

684
00:54:05,323 --> 00:54:07,617
- How was your sound?
- One more time.

685
00:54:09,744 --> 00:54:11,954
Let me respectfully
tell the American people...

686
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:15,041
that this is their dirtiest
and longest war.

687
00:54:15,124 --> 00:54:17,752
The Vietnamese fight
only in self-defense.

688
00:54:17,835 --> 00:54:21,339
Ultimately, the Americans
will see the light.

689
00:54:21,464 --> 00:54:24,383
If not, they will
defeat themselves.

690
00:54:24,467 --> 00:54:28,805
You know, Vietnam, uh,
reminded me of a... of a child,

691
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:31,349
the developing of a child.

692
00:54:31,432 --> 00:54:34,977
The laws of nature control
the development of this child.

693
00:54:35,102 --> 00:54:37,021
A child has to sit up
before it crawls.

694
00:54:37,146 --> 00:54:39,106
It has to crawl before it walks.

695
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:41,234
It has to walk before it runs.

696
00:54:44,987 --> 00:54:47,615
No matter how
many decades America fights,

697
00:54:53,871 --> 00:54:57,959
I'm telling you so that you will go
back and repeat it to President Nixon.

698
00:55:01,712 --> 00:55:05,967
Over here, as long as there is
rice to eat, we'll keep fighting.

699
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:11,180
And if the rice runs out, then we'll
plow the fields and fight again.

700
00:55:11,305 --> 00:55:14,892
I know very little about it
over there, I'll tell ya.

701
00:55:15,017 --> 00:55:18,104
And the less I know,
the better off I'll be.

702
00:55:18,187 --> 00:55:20,189
It has not affected me a whole lot.

703
00:55:20,314 --> 00:55:23,401
I mean, the American...
The way of life is still here.

704
00:55:23,484 --> 00:55:26,279
And if you work for it,
it's there for you.

705
00:55:26,362 --> 00:55:29,907
We're taught that we're
to obey our government,

706
00:55:30,032 --> 00:55:33,035
and I would have to go
if I was instructed to.

707
00:55:33,161 --> 00:55:35,037
Once in a while, I think about it,

708
00:55:35,163 --> 00:55:38,833
but I like to think about the things
that are happening right now to me.

709
00:55:38,916 --> 00:55:41,836
I don't it's affected mine at all.

710
00:55:41,919 --> 00:55:45,673
I don't even know who we're fighting for
over there, to be real honest with you.

711
00:55:45,756 --> 00:55:48,843
I think we're fighting
for the North Vietnamese, ain't we?

712
00:55:53,347 --> 00:55:57,435
I fled from Dau Tien
to go live in Suoi Dua.

713
00:55:59,103 --> 00:56:02,482
Then I was allowed to go back,
and I went back...

714
00:56:02,565 --> 00:56:04,984
and stayed in Ben Chua.

715
00:56:06,611 --> 00:56:10,573
While I was in Ben Chua,
trouble broke out again.

716
00:56:10,698 --> 00:56:14,619
So I was taken up to Co Tach.

717
00:56:14,744 --> 00:56:17,747
I was picked up again
and sent to Ben Chua...

718
00:56:17,872 --> 00:56:20,249
to be lumped together
with the others.

719
00:56:24,587 --> 00:56:29,425
My house burned down
while I was away.

720
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:31,594
Once more, I got sent to Co Tach.

721
00:56:34,263 --> 00:56:39,227
I've fled five, six,
at least seven times already.

722
00:56:41,187 --> 00:56:46,400
The lives of my countrymen are
worth no more than that of a fly.

723
00:56:46,484 --> 00:56:50,029
You take it and swat it dead...

724
00:56:50,113 --> 00:56:52,115
just like that.

725
00:57:26,357 --> 00:57:29,610
Ladies, listen to me.

726
00:57:29,694 --> 00:57:34,407
There were some women amusing themselves
and one pushed the other onto a table.

727
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:37,785
The lady's falsies
broke the table in two.

728
00:57:39,829 --> 00:57:44,709
If a table breaks, think of what
would happen to a man's face.

729
00:57:46,377 --> 00:57:49,380
Watch it, they're filming.
Don't joke.

730
00:57:49,505 --> 00:57:52,633
People in America
will think we're ridiculous.

731
00:57:55,595 --> 00:57:58,097
We have about 15 companies now,

732
00:57:58,222 --> 00:58:03,311
including an insurance company
and a tractor company.

733
00:58:03,436 --> 00:58:07,482
We are in the hotel business,
in the travel agency business.

734
00:58:07,607 --> 00:58:12,320
We are the exclusive dealer
for Ford in the country, Ford cars.

735
00:58:12,445 --> 00:58:15,114
Oh, many, many other things,

736
00:58:15,198 --> 00:58:17,116
like, uh, an oil company
in the forming.

737
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,162
We, uh, have a bottling company.
In other words, uh,

738
00:58:21,287 --> 00:58:24,832
we greatly... we greatly believe
in the future of this country,

739
00:58:24,957 --> 00:58:27,794
and, uh, we think
there's a great future for Vietnam.

740
00:58:27,877 --> 00:58:31,881
And, uh, we think
that Vietnam will be liveable,

741
00:58:32,006 --> 00:58:34,050
will not go communist,

742
00:58:34,175 --> 00:58:36,552
because otherwise, all these
companies will go to waste.

743
00:58:36,677 --> 00:58:40,348
And the way we work
is we take a calculated risk.

744
00:58:40,473 --> 00:58:44,435
If we don't lose South Vietnam
within the next three to five years,

745
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,687
then nobody can catch up with us.

746
00:58:46,771 --> 00:58:51,984
I'm a Johnny-come-lately as far
as war profiteering is concerned.

747
00:58:53,152 --> 00:58:55,863
Uh, the reason why I...

748
00:58:55,947 --> 00:59:00,993
uh, organized this group of companies
is because when I was in Paris,

749
00:59:01,077 --> 00:59:04,664
I saw that peace was coming,
whether we liked it or not.

750
00:59:04,789 --> 00:59:08,709
Therefore, I got home
in order to prepare for peace.

751
00:59:08,793 --> 00:59:14,298
All these companies have been organized
in order to prepare for peace...

752
00:59:14,423 --> 00:59:18,553
and prepare for the economic
takeoff that will come with peace.

753
00:59:18,636 --> 00:59:23,224
We have the infrastructure of hotels, of
travel agencies and things like that.

754
00:59:23,349 --> 00:59:27,687
But, of course, there are no tourists
in Vietnam now. But there will be.

755
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:31,232
And, uh, we are getting
ready for that sort of thing.

756
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:50,251
Does it feel comfortable?

757
01:00:41,803 --> 01:00:46,015
Keep it flat. Just like you
do with your good leg.

758
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,559
Now try to walk.

759
01:00:56,526 --> 01:00:59,570
Well, it really isn't that much.
We were just walking and...

760
01:00:59,695 --> 01:01:04,575
We were walking on a patrol
and, uh, we ran into an ambush.

761
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,577
About six, seven guys
really got hurt.

762
01:01:06,702 --> 01:01:10,081
Ran into a battalion ambush,
they said it was.

763
01:01:10,164 --> 01:01:14,585
And it was supposed to be one of the
biggest ambushes of Tet season.

764
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:20,591
And we called in two or three
medivacs, and they got hit.

765
01:01:20,716 --> 01:01:24,595
So, finally, the last one
came in and got us out.

766
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:28,766
From that, I never saw any of the others
I was with, except for one or two.

767
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:30,768
And that was about it.

768
01:01:30,852 --> 01:01:34,480
Most of the guys I keep in touch
with are guys in the hospital.

769
01:01:34,564 --> 01:01:36,774
They usually have a reunion
once a year.

770
01:01:40,403 --> 01:01:43,197
That's about it. There's really
not that much to talk about.

771
01:01:46,325 --> 01:01:51,873
Here we are for one thing that we
said, and I don't give a shit now.

772
01:01:51,998 --> 01:01:54,375
I don't care
about the football game now.

773
01:01:54,459 --> 01:01:56,627
I don't care about anything now.

774
01:01:56,752 --> 01:02:00,631
The one thing that we wanna show these
bastards with Masillon pride...

775
01:02:00,756 --> 01:02:03,134
is that we come down and show
'em a great Masillon effort.

776
01:02:03,217 --> 01:02:06,304
And what the piss you doing?
What are ya doing?

777
01:02:06,429 --> 01:02:08,306
Get going! Goddamn it, Tony!

778
01:02:08,431 --> 01:02:10,641
Don't let 'em beat us!
Don't let 'em beat us!

779
01:02:10,766 --> 01:02:12,643
Let's go! Show 'em Masillon pride.

780
01:02:12,768 --> 01:02:15,146
- Come on! Go!
- Go!

781
01:02:15,229 --> 01:02:17,607
Go, go, go, go!

782
01:02:32,288 --> 01:02:34,373
Get him! Get him!

783
01:02:42,215 --> 01:02:44,425
Make no mistake about it.

784
01:02:46,052 --> 01:02:48,179
I don't want a man in here...

785
01:02:48,262 --> 01:02:51,682
To go back home thinking otherwise.

786
01:02:51,808 --> 01:02:54,101
We are going to win.

787
01:03:15,456 --> 01:03:17,291
Go, motherfucker! Go!

788
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:19,293
Since the Lunar New Year,

789
01:03:19,377 --> 01:03:22,213
the Vietcong and North Vietnamese
have proved they are capable...

790
01:03:22,296 --> 01:03:24,799
of bold and impressive
military moves...

791
01:03:24,924 --> 01:03:27,718
that Americans here
never dreamed could be achieved.

792
01:03:27,844 --> 01:03:32,306
Whether the Vietcong can sustain this
onslaught long remains to be seen,

793
01:03:32,431 --> 01:03:34,642
but whatever turn
this war now takes,

794
01:03:34,767 --> 01:03:37,895
the capture of the U.S. Embassy
in Saigon for seven hours...

795
01:03:37,979 --> 01:03:41,399
will be a story to rally
and inspire the Vietcong.

796
01:03:41,482 --> 01:03:46,112
Don North, ABC news,
at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon.

797
01:03:46,195 --> 01:03:50,408
I know that, as was the case in the
Battle of the Bulge in World War II,

798
01:03:50,491 --> 01:03:53,411
that after the enemy exposed
himself, we would defeat him.

799
01:03:53,494 --> 01:03:57,331
He would be weakened, and
we could follow that up.

800
01:03:57,457 --> 01:03:59,750
Through the use of, uh,

801
01:03:59,876 --> 01:04:03,921
the maximum military force that
we could bring to bear on him,

802
01:04:04,005 --> 01:04:06,924
through the bombing, through
the mining of the harbors,

803
01:04:07,008 --> 01:04:09,427
through the cutting of his
lines of communication,

804
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:11,762
by moving in and cleaning
out his sanctuaries,

805
01:04:11,888 --> 01:04:14,182
the enemy would have no choice...

806
01:04:14,265 --> 01:04:16,309
but to come to some accommodation.

807
01:04:16,392 --> 01:04:18,853
In the beginning of 1968,

808
01:04:18,978 --> 01:04:22,940
General Westmoreland needed
206,000 more troops.

809
01:04:23,024 --> 01:04:26,027
We met hour after hour after
hour in the Pentagon.

810
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:31,741
And I started in and asked
the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

811
01:04:31,866 --> 01:04:34,494
"How long do you think that
we'll still be in the war?"

812
01:04:34,577 --> 01:04:36,704
None of them knew.

813
01:04:36,829 --> 01:04:41,209
"Uh, do you think that the
206,000 men will be enough?"

814
01:04:41,292 --> 01:04:43,211
Nobody knew.

815
01:04:43,294 --> 01:04:47,298
"Uh, might we have to send
more men?" "Well, possibly."

816
01:04:47,381 --> 01:04:49,300
"Well, in six months?"
"We don't know."

817
01:04:49,383 --> 01:04:51,052
"A year? Eighteen months?"

818
01:04:51,177 --> 01:04:53,721
I couldn't get answers
to these questions.

819
01:04:53,846 --> 01:04:57,809
By the end of that
four-day interrogation,

820
01:04:57,934 --> 01:05:01,729
I was getting down... by the end of it...
into very serious questions,

821
01:05:01,854 --> 01:05:07,151
"Do any of you men, as you
look at it objectively,

822
01:05:07,235 --> 01:05:12,657
do you find any diminution in the
will of the enemy to fight?"

823
01:05:12,782 --> 01:05:14,992
Well, they said,
"No, we guess we don't."

824
01:05:15,076 --> 01:05:18,496
"Are they sending the same number of men
down through the Ho Chi Minh trail?"

825
01:05:18,579 --> 01:05:22,500
"Well, yes, and even they
might be a little more."

826
01:05:22,583 --> 01:05:27,505
"And how about our bombing? We've
placed great reliance on our bombing.

827
01:05:27,588 --> 01:05:29,924
Is our bombing stopping them?"
"No."

828
01:05:30,007 --> 01:05:33,427
"Well, what is the amount of attrition
that our bombing's causing?"

829
01:05:33,553 --> 01:05:36,764
"Well, maybe 10 to 15 percent."

830
01:05:36,889 --> 01:05:39,183
So I remember asking one question.

831
01:05:39,267 --> 01:05:44,605
"If a North Vietnamese field commander
in South Vietnam needed 1,000 men..."

832
01:05:44,689 --> 01:05:46,607
They said, "Yes."

833
01:05:46,691 --> 01:05:52,321
"If he asked for, say, 1,200
men, 1,000 would get through?"

834
01:05:52,447 --> 01:05:54,323
"Well, that's right."

835
01:05:54,449 --> 01:05:57,869
'then he'd have the thousand he
needed." "Well, yes. That's so."

836
01:05:57,994 --> 01:06:03,207
Well, this type of interrogation...
Finally, by the end of four or five days,

837
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:06,043
I must say that my thinking...

838
01:06:06,127 --> 01:06:10,256
had undergone a very
substantial revolution.

839
01:06:27,231 --> 01:06:30,485
Come on, everybody!

840
01:06:45,708 --> 01:06:49,253
As long as the
American President...

841
01:06:49,337 --> 01:06:52,799
is commander in chief...

842
01:06:52,882 --> 01:06:58,596
of the biggest war machine
in human history,

843
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:04,602
with bases on every continent, we
are going to get into trouble.

844
01:07:04,685 --> 01:07:10,066
Our enemy is the growing
militarization of American life.

845
01:07:10,191 --> 01:07:14,028
Our enemy is American imperialism.

846
01:07:14,153 --> 01:07:16,447
And there is an awakening.

847
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:21,953
The enemy was on the ropes after
the Tet offensive was over.

848
01:07:22,078 --> 01:07:24,539
And it's like two
boxers in the ring.

849
01:07:24,664 --> 01:07:26,791
One boxer has the other
one on the ropes,

850
01:07:26,874 --> 01:07:29,794
but the man who is about
to be the victor...

851
01:07:29,877 --> 01:07:32,380
has his second throw the towel in.

852
01:07:32,463 --> 01:07:34,507
Accordingly,

853
01:07:36,008 --> 01:07:38,010
I shall not seek...

854
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:41,973
and I will not accept...

855
01:07:42,098 --> 01:07:45,893
the nomination of my party for
another term as your president.

856
01:07:46,936 --> 01:07:48,855
I don't think we
helped 'em one bit.

857
01:07:48,938 --> 01:07:51,649
All I think we've done is destroyed
their country, laid it waste.

858
01:07:51,732 --> 01:07:54,402
No. I don't think we helped 'em.

859
01:07:54,527 --> 01:07:58,072
As fellow human beings, I don't think
they should be there doing that.

860
01:07:58,197 --> 01:08:00,700
Certainly a mature person can
say they made a mistake.

861
01:08:00,783 --> 01:08:02,243
Why can't a government?

862
01:08:02,368 --> 01:08:06,747
You let us all go off to war and said,
"Yea, team. Fight in Vietnam,"

863
01:08:06,873 --> 01:08:09,667
and all this kinda shit
in 1965 through 1968.

864
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:14,172
Now 1968 comes along and "Boo, team.
Come on home," and all this shit.

865
01:08:14,255 --> 01:08:17,008
"And don't say nothin' about it, 'cause
we don't want to hear about it...

866
01:08:17,091 --> 01:08:19,010
'cause it's upsetting
around dinnertime."

867
01:08:19,093 --> 01:08:21,345
Well, Goddamn. It upset me
for a whole goddamn year.

868
01:08:21,429 --> 01:08:24,389
It upset a lot of people to the point
where they're fuckin' dead, you know?

869
01:08:24,432 --> 01:08:27,351
All this shit. You don't wanna hear
about it? I'll tell you every day.

870
01:08:27,435 --> 01:08:29,854
Make you sit out and puke
on your dinner, you dig?

871
01:08:29,937 --> 01:08:32,857
Because you got me over there, and
now you done brought me back here...

872
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:36,027
and you wanna forget it so somebody
else can go do it somewhere else.

873
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:38,196
Hell no. Uh-uh.
You gonna hear it all.

874
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:42,533
Every day as long as you live, because
it's gonna be with me as long as I live.

875
01:08:42,617 --> 01:08:44,744
When I get up in the morning,
when John gets up,

876
01:08:44,827 --> 01:08:46,871
when a lot of dudes
sitting here get up,

877
01:08:46,954 --> 01:08:49,040
man, their gut hurts
because they got shot there.

878
01:08:49,123 --> 01:08:52,043
I gotta put on an arm and a leg, 'cause
it ain't there no more, you dig?

879
01:08:52,126 --> 01:08:55,546
Now, my man's got a hole in his stomach.
He can't work right, you know?

880
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:59,050
You do something about that.
Make that all disappear, you dig?

881
01:08:59,133 --> 01:09:01,052
Make it all go away
with the 6:00 news.

882
01:09:01,135 --> 01:09:03,721
Turn it off or switch it
to another channel.

883
01:09:03,805 --> 01:09:07,058
Uh-Uh. To hell with that, you dig?
It's here and it's for real.

884
01:09:07,141 --> 01:09:10,061
And it's gonna happen again unless
these folks get off their ass...

885
01:09:10,144 --> 01:09:12,146
and realize it has happened.

886
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:22,740
The country is ready to pass
a reasoned judgment on this war.

887
01:09:22,824 --> 01:09:26,577
The people have judged, I think,
that it's unwise and immoral...

888
01:09:26,661 --> 01:09:29,413
and not in the national interest
of this country...

889
01:09:29,497 --> 01:09:31,999
and that, therefore,
it must be brought to an end.

890
01:09:36,212 --> 01:09:39,757
For 20 years, first the French,
and then the United States...

891
01:09:39,841 --> 01:09:43,094
had been predicting
victory in Vietnam.

892
01:09:43,177 --> 01:09:46,264
In 1961 and in 1962,

893
01:09:46,347 --> 01:09:49,767
as well as 1966 and 1967,

894
01:09:49,851 --> 01:09:52,270
we have been told
that the tide is turning,

895
01:09:52,353 --> 01:09:57,442
there is a light at the end of the tunnel,
we can soon bring our troops home,

896
01:09:57,525 --> 01:10:00,528
victory is near, the
enemy is tiring.

897
01:10:00,611 --> 01:10:02,655
Once, in 1962,

898
01:10:02,738 --> 01:10:07,285
I participated
in such a prediction myself.

899
01:10:07,368 --> 01:10:10,455
But for 20 years,
we have been wrong.

900
01:10:10,538 --> 01:10:12,957
The history of conflict
among nations...

901
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:18,129
does not record another such lengthy
and consistent chronicle of error...

902
01:10:18,212 --> 01:10:20,715
as we have shown in Vietnam.

903
01:10:20,798 --> 01:10:23,718
I had just given the policy line,

904
01:10:23,843 --> 01:10:27,305
stayed up all night with
Adam Walinsky and Peter Edelman,

905
01:10:27,388 --> 01:10:29,307
helping on a speech
for Robert Kennedy...

906
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:33,019
which proved to be his last speech
given in San Francisco here...

907
01:10:33,144 --> 01:10:36,314
to a businessman's
luncheon on Vietnam.

908
01:10:36,397 --> 01:10:40,735
Uh, I went up with some corrections
last thing in the morning...

909
01:10:40,818 --> 01:10:44,155
and shook hands with him in his
bathrobe as he stood there.

910
01:10:44,238 --> 01:10:47,825
And then he came down from the
Ambassador Hotel and got into a car.

911
01:10:47,909 --> 01:10:52,163
We were struck with how easy
it was to get onto that floor...

912
01:10:52,246 --> 01:10:54,165
and approach him at that point.

913
01:10:54,248 --> 01:10:56,250
At the conference on
lessons on Vietnam,

914
01:10:56,334 --> 01:10:59,587
of course, in the morning I learned
that Robert Kennedy had died.

915
01:11:06,093 --> 01:11:08,221
Well...

916
01:11:10,598 --> 01:11:12,934
So...

917
01:11:13,059 --> 01:11:15,770
So, uh...

918
01:11:20,108 --> 01:11:24,278
Well, that was a way for a lot
of people to feel powerless.

919
01:11:34,789 --> 01:11:37,208
So, um,

920
01:11:37,291 --> 01:11:40,753
it began to look as if there was
no way to change this country.

921
01:12:33,973 --> 01:12:36,851
We'd been going down this
road for so many years,

922
01:12:36,976 --> 01:12:41,105
and I had felt so strongly before
that this was the right policy,

923
01:12:41,189 --> 01:12:43,775
that it was difficult
for me to change.

924
01:12:43,858 --> 01:12:49,238
I know now that the domino
theory was a false theory.

925
01:12:49,363 --> 01:12:53,993
I know now that we should
not have become involved.

926
01:12:54,076 --> 01:12:58,956
As far as I'm concerned today, I
have no hesitancy whatsoever...

927
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:05,213
in saying I could not have been more wrong...
in my attitude toward Vietnam.

928
01:13:10,301 --> 01:13:14,555
Ground combat, Vietnamese cross
of gallantry with a silver star,

929
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:19,977
gallantry in ground combat, four air
medals, an "I was there" ribbon.

930
01:13:25,566 --> 01:13:28,486
I got a colonel that's flying upstairs,
and he's gettin' down on me...

931
01:13:28,569 --> 01:13:32,323
and he's saying, 'take the hill,
take the hill, take the hill."

932
01:13:32,406 --> 01:13:35,493
So I got together
with the tank commander...

933
01:13:35,576 --> 01:13:37,829
and I said,
"Look, let's take three tanks...

934
01:13:37,912 --> 01:13:40,832
and we'll walk the A.R.V.N.
Up the hill, you know?

935
01:13:40,915 --> 01:13:44,085
And we'll lay down a base of fire
as we're going."

936
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:47,505
He says, "Okay." I got with the
A.R.V.N. And says, "Let's fly."

937
01:13:47,588 --> 01:13:53,136
So I popped up behind the lead tank...
and, uh, started to go up the hill.

938
01:13:53,261 --> 01:13:57,598
And everything was cool,
until we started taking fire.

939
01:13:57,723 --> 01:14:00,935
And, uh, the A.R.V.N.
started to split.

940
01:14:03,104 --> 01:14:05,273
And that's when I got it.

941
01:14:05,398 --> 01:14:10,278
I said, "Oh, my God. I'm hit."
I couldn't believe it, you know?

942
01:14:10,403 --> 01:14:12,530
"I can't believe it.
I'm really hit."

943
01:14:12,613 --> 01:14:17,910
And my first, first thought...
was Kay, my girl, you know?

944
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:24,125
It's gonna sound stupid, but I'm...
but my thought was "she'll kill me."

945
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:27,920
You know, here I was dying and I was
worried that she was gonna kill me.

946
01:14:28,004 --> 01:14:32,967
But then I realized that I didn't
have to worry because I was dying.

947
01:14:33,092 --> 01:14:36,721
It's all over. And
for what, you know?

948
01:14:36,804 --> 01:14:39,640
My last... My last
conscious thought...

949
01:14:39,724 --> 01:14:43,144
was "I can't believe it. I'm dying.

950
01:14:43,227 --> 01:14:48,649
On this shitty piece of ground, I'm dying...
and I can't fuckin' believe it."

951
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:52,945
Bobby was a surfer, he was a wrestler,
he was a long-distance runner.

952
01:14:53,029 --> 01:14:55,823
We danced. He was active.
Active, active.

953
01:14:55,907 --> 01:14:58,117
Our whole life was active.

954
01:14:58,201 --> 01:15:00,369
And now they're telling
me that he's paralyzed.

955
01:15:00,495 --> 01:15:03,414
He couldn't believe it and I
couldn't believe it. Right now...

956
01:15:03,498 --> 01:15:07,418
Bobby's not a boyfriend. He's not
a husband. He's not a brother.

957
01:15:07,502 --> 01:15:10,505
It-It's very...

958
01:15:12,632 --> 01:15:14,592
It's very hard.

959
01:15:14,675 --> 01:15:16,928
What hurts the most...

960
01:15:17,011 --> 01:15:19,222
and this is a purely
personal thing, you know?

961
01:15:19,347 --> 01:15:22,975
Right, wrong or indifferent,
that's how I feel.

962
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,103
When I was in the Marine Corps,

963
01:15:25,186 --> 01:15:28,106
I remember I was in the Marine
Corps barracks in Washington...

964
01:15:28,189 --> 01:15:30,191
They call it "A," "F," and "I."

965
01:15:30,274 --> 01:15:33,111
And they had the Marine
Corps drill team there.

966
01:15:33,194 --> 01:15:37,281
And I was standing at
attention in my uniform...

967
01:15:37,365 --> 01:15:39,283
and they were playing the
"Marine Corps Hymn".

968
01:15:39,367 --> 01:15:42,620
And then they played the
'star-Spangled Banner."

969
01:15:42,703 --> 01:15:44,914
And I actually started to cry.

970
01:15:46,374 --> 01:15:51,045
I cried because I was so proud
to be an American, you know?

971
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:53,965
And I was so proud
to be a marine...

972
01:15:54,048 --> 01:15:57,051
and in uniform, standing
there at attention.

973
01:15:59,053 --> 01:16:02,890
That-That represented
so much to me...

974
01:16:02,974 --> 01:16:06,477
in the way of life and...

975
01:16:06,561 --> 01:16:09,063
That's gone, you know?

976
01:16:09,188 --> 01:16:12,483
And that hurt. That hurts.

977
01:16:12,567 --> 01:16:14,569
That's what I'm bitter about.

978
01:17:08,456 --> 01:17:12,543
Ha! Didn't think we were here,
did you, you dirty rotten rats!

979
01:17:12,627 --> 01:17:14,754
We're still here!
We'll always be here!

980
01:17:35,316 --> 01:17:39,153
Truman lied from 1950 on...

981
01:17:39,237 --> 01:17:42,156
on the nature and purposes
of the French involvement,

982
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:48,079
the colonial reconquest of Vietnam...
that we were financing and encouraging.

983
01:17:48,162 --> 01:17:50,581
Eisenhower lied
about the reasons for...

984
01:17:50,665 --> 01:17:53,084
and the nature
of our involvement with Diem,

985
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:55,837
and the fact that he was in power,
essentially,

986
01:17:55,962 --> 01:18:00,258
because of American support,
American money, and for no other reason.

987
01:18:00,341 --> 01:18:05,680
Kennedy lied about the type of
involvement we were doing there,

988
01:18:05,763 --> 01:18:07,682
our own combat involvement,

989
01:18:07,765 --> 01:18:11,269
and about the recommendations that were
made to him for greater involvement.

990
01:18:11,352 --> 01:18:13,271
President Kennedy lied about...

991
01:18:13,354 --> 01:18:16,482
the degree of our participation
in the overthrow of Diem.

992
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:22,113
The, um... Johnson, of course,
lied and lied and lied...

993
01:18:22,196 --> 01:18:24,740
about our provocations
against the North Vietnamese...

994
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:27,618
prior to and after
the Tonkin Gulf incidents,

995
01:18:27,702 --> 01:18:31,289
about the plans
for bombing North Vietnam,

996
01:18:31,372 --> 01:18:35,626
and the nature of the buildup...

997
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:38,129
of American troops in Vietnam.

998
01:18:38,212 --> 01:18:42,633
Nixon, as we now know, misled and
lied to the American public...

999
01:18:42,717 --> 01:18:46,179
for the first months of his office in
terms of our bombing of Cambodia...

1000
01:18:46,262 --> 01:18:48,681
and of Laos,
ground operations in Laos,

1001
01:18:50,016 --> 01:18:53,478
the reasons for our invasion
of Cambodia and of Laos,

1002
01:18:53,561 --> 01:18:57,982
and the prospects for the mining at
Haiphong that came about in 1972,

1003
01:18:58,065 --> 01:19:00,693
but was envisioned
as early as 1969.

1004
01:19:01,986 --> 01:19:05,573
The American public
was lied to month by month...

1005
01:19:05,698 --> 01:19:08,576
by each of these
five administrations.

1006
01:19:08,701 --> 01:19:12,330
As I say, it's a tribute
to the American public,

1007
01:19:12,413 --> 01:19:16,834
that their leaders perceived
that they had to be lied to.

1008
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:21,255
It's no tribute to us that it
was so easy to fool the public.

1009
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:23,841
We have adopted a plan...

1010
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:27,386
which we have worked out in cooperation
with the South Vietnamese...

1011
01:19:27,512 --> 01:19:32,350
for the complete withdrawal of
all U.S. combat ground forces...

1012
01:19:32,433 --> 01:19:35,853
and their replacement
by South Vietnamese forces...

1013
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:38,856
on an orderly, scheduled timetable.

1014
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:42,693
This withdrawal will be made from
strength and not from weakness.

1015
01:19:42,777 --> 01:19:45,363
As South Vietnamese forces
become stronger,

1016
01:19:45,446 --> 01:19:49,450
the rate of American withdrawal
can become greater.

1017
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:55,957
Congratulations to Battalion 332...

1018
01:19:56,082 --> 01:19:59,710
on your recent victories
over the communists.

1019
01:19:59,794 --> 01:20:03,714
We ask ourselves,
"When will peace come?"

1020
01:20:03,798 --> 01:20:07,385
And I tell you, if you chase
the communists back to the north,

1021
01:20:07,468 --> 01:20:10,471
there won't be any war
in this hamlet.

1022
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:13,891
Help rebuild the houses.

1023
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:16,102
Help the people.

1024
01:20:17,812 --> 01:20:20,565
Rid the hamlet of all V. C...

1025
01:20:20,648 --> 01:20:23,276
so there will be no more suffering
and destruction...

1026
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:26,863
for ourselves and our compatriots.

1027
01:20:31,492 --> 01:20:34,245
Oh, my friend.

1028
01:20:34,328 --> 01:20:36,414
- How you doing? Good to see you again.
- You just get back?

1029
01:20:36,497 --> 01:20:39,584
- Yeah. How you doing, men?
- Very good to see you.

1030
01:20:39,667 --> 01:20:41,919
How you doing?
Trung, good seeing you.

1031
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:45,423
- Good to see you, sir.
- How you doing? Fine.

1032
01:20:45,506 --> 01:20:48,426
Just came in this afternoon, sir.
Been very quiet?

1033
01:20:48,509 --> 01:20:51,929
- Except last time, when the, uh...
- When the rockets went off?

1034
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:53,931
Yeah.

1035
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:57,018
Very nice. I read about
it in Stars And Stripes.

1036
01:20:57,143 --> 01:20:59,604
That's one of our success stories
here, this battalion is.

1037
01:20:59,687 --> 01:21:01,773
We had a real, uh...
a lot of trouble with it.

1038
01:21:01,856 --> 01:21:04,275
We just gave, uh,
four bronze stars...

1039
01:21:04,358 --> 01:21:07,445
and five Ar-Comms
with V-device this week...

1040
01:21:07,528 --> 01:21:11,282
to a battalion commander and three
of his officers and five soldiers.

1041
01:21:11,365 --> 01:21:14,786
And we have six N-pac awards...

1042
01:21:14,869 --> 01:21:17,455
pending for
last Saturday night's action...

1043
01:21:17,538 --> 01:21:20,374
where we killed six V.C.
And captured nine weapons.

1044
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:21,417
Good grief.

1045
01:21:21,542 --> 01:21:26,798
He had been the recon company
commander of the, uh, 263rd...

1046
01:21:26,881 --> 01:21:31,636
and he'd done a real tremendous job
just as recon company commander.

1047
01:21:31,719 --> 01:21:34,806
And then they moved him over here.

1048
01:21:34,889 --> 01:21:37,489
In a ten-day period or two-week
period, he completely reversed it.

1049
01:21:37,558 --> 01:21:42,522
They had the battalion here
under a very poor major.

1050
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:46,150
They had it to the point
where the company commanders...

1051
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:49,487
were throwing down their weapons
and crying... or at least one of them did.

1052
01:21:49,570 --> 01:21:52,490
Ten days later they had
a big contact with the V. C...

1053
01:21:52,573 --> 01:21:57,703
and in 3 days killed 42,
lost none of their own.

1054
01:21:57,787 --> 01:22:00,373
He does it with a
fairly limited staff.

1055
01:22:00,498 --> 01:22:03,835
Although some of his people, like
that young major there, Major Yuk...

1056
01:22:03,918 --> 01:22:05,837
tremendous guy.

1057
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:09,465
He just heard his name over there.
Hey.

1058
01:22:28,901 --> 01:22:31,446
It's no surprise
that in a very poor country...

1059
01:22:31,571 --> 01:22:35,783
you can find people
who will wear foreign uniforms.

1060
01:22:35,908 --> 01:22:37,785
What has always surprised us,

1061
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:41,789
what we've never been willing
to predict or understand,

1062
01:22:41,914 --> 01:22:44,792
is that the Vietnamese
communist leadership...

1063
01:22:44,917 --> 01:22:48,045
can find enough people
to live in the tunnels,

1064
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:51,048
fight for nothing
wearing ragged shorts,

1065
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:53,634
year after year
under the American bombs.

1066
01:22:53,759 --> 01:22:58,055
A war in which one side
is entirely financed...

1067
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:03,144
and equipped and supported by foreigners...
is not a civil war.

1068
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:05,146
The only foreigners
in that country...

1069
01:23:05,271 --> 01:23:07,899
were the foreigners we financed
in the first part of the war...

1070
01:23:07,982 --> 01:23:12,904
and the foreigners we were
in the second half of the war.

1071
01:23:12,987 --> 01:23:17,408
Basically, we didn't want to acknowledge...
the scale of our involvement there.

1072
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:19,410
We didn't want to realize
that it was our war,

1073
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:23,748
because that would have been to say
that every casualty on both sides...

1074
01:23:23,831 --> 01:23:26,334
was a casualty
caused by our policy.

1075
01:23:26,459 --> 01:23:30,338
The question used to be "Might it
be possible we were on the wrong side...

1076
01:23:30,421 --> 01:23:32,715
in the Vietnamese War?"

1077
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,259
We weren't on the wrong side.

1078
01:23:35,343 --> 01:23:38,054
We are the wrong side.

1079
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:47,271
You have exemplified,
in your corner of the world,

1080
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:49,524
patriotism of the highest order.

1081
01:23:49,649 --> 01:23:54,654
You have brought to your great task
of organizing your country...

1082
01:23:54,737 --> 01:23:58,199
the greatest of courage,
the greatest of statesmanship.

1083
01:24:09,335 --> 01:24:11,295
I had two possibilities.

1084
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:14,632
Either I could submit
to Washington's politics...

1085
01:24:14,715 --> 01:24:17,885
Every morning, "Yes, sir."

1086
01:24:18,010 --> 01:24:20,513
Or I would have to resign.

1087
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:27,061
You can be sure that as a soldier
I only submit very rarely.

1088
01:24:30,356 --> 01:24:32,316
And, in fact, never.

1089
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,236
I chose the second solution,
that of resigning.

1090
01:24:35,319 --> 01:24:40,158
On the Vietnamese side, I would say
the most encouraging factor...

1091
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:43,035
is the promise offered
by General Khanh's government.

1092
01:24:46,914 --> 01:24:51,335
Through a security
service in the president's office,

1093
01:24:51,419 --> 01:24:54,839
we taped all communications
with the outside.

1094
01:24:54,922 --> 01:24:58,342
All telephone communications.

1095
01:24:58,426 --> 01:25:02,346
And fortunately, among these
taped telephone communications,

1096
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:05,850
I still have the tape
from which we can hear precisely...

1097
01:25:05,933 --> 01:25:07,977
General Taylor...

1098
01:25:10,521 --> 01:25:14,484
stating precisely that he wants me,
General Khanh,

1099
01:25:16,944 --> 01:25:19,363
to leave Vietnam.

1100
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:22,575
Can you let us hear it?

1101
01:25:25,119 --> 01:25:27,455
Certainly. I hope it works.

1102
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:34,045
- General Taylor.
- Uh, this is General Khanh speaking.

1103
01:25:34,128 --> 01:25:36,047
How are you? Glad to hear you.

1104
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:39,550
Uh, uh, may I speak in French?

1105
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:10,414
Mr. President and ladies and gentlemen,
as our joint communique indicates,

1106
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:13,751
President Thieu and I have
had very constructive talks...

1107
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:18,089
with regard to how we shall
work together in the years ahead,

1108
01:26:18,172 --> 01:26:22,426
working for the program of peace,

1109
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:27,473
which we now hope
will all be the wave of the future,

1110
01:26:27,598 --> 01:26:30,768
not only for the
Republic of Vietnam,

1111
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:33,771
but for all of the countries
in Indochina.

1112
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:57,086
What kind of freedom
could you preserve here...

1113
01:26:57,211 --> 01:27:01,966
when you put so many
of our compatriots into prison...

1114
01:27:02,049 --> 01:27:05,887
without any charge,
without any reason why?

1115
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:11,976
Just because you want us
to have freedom?

1116
01:27:12,059 --> 01:27:15,646
What kind of freedom
could you give us?

1117
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:19,650
We know that we only have freedom
if we fight for it.

1118
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:23,571
But here we fight for what?

1119
01:27:23,654 --> 01:27:25,573
We fight for prisons?

1120
01:27:30,578 --> 01:27:34,707
People can be arrested
at any moment by any organization.

1121
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:41,297
And then tortured in inhuman ways
in all the prisons.

1122
01:27:42,548 --> 01:27:44,926
And, above all, in police stations.

1123
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:52,725
And then imprisoned
for years and years without trial.

1124
01:27:53,851 --> 01:27:55,895
Their only crime
is loving their country.

1125
01:27:58,272 --> 01:28:01,526
They had the courage
to tell the truth.

1126
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:04,862
They asked for the liberation
of political prisoners.

1127
01:28:07,281 --> 01:28:09,617
They asked for an end to the war.

1128
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:15,206
They asked for peace,
for national reconciliation.

1129
01:28:15,289 --> 01:28:19,752
And all that is considered a crime
by the government of Thieu.

1130
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:28,803
I was arrested in 1968.

1131
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:31,931
I was at home
when the security police came.

1132
01:28:33,307 --> 01:28:36,310
They took me to headquarters
for a few questions...

1133
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:38,438
and kept me.

1134
01:28:44,068 --> 01:28:47,738
You can't imagine
how badly I was beaten.

1135
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:51,492
Mostly on the head.
My eyes are bad now.

1136
01:28:51,617 --> 01:28:55,079
After I was arrested,
I was beaten so badly...

1137
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,290
even now
I sometimes have headaches...

1138
01:28:57,373 --> 01:28:59,667
and nosebleeds and ear-bleeds.

1139
01:29:03,504 --> 01:29:07,175
In those days, all we were
getting to eat was rotten fish,

1140
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,594
so we asked for some vegetables.

1141
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:12,513
But when we complained,
we were beaten and chained...

1142
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:14,766
and lime powder was thrown on us.

1143
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:18,311
And they poured water on us,
and we had nowhere to run.

1144
01:29:23,816 --> 01:29:26,110
Our cells were this big...

1145
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:28,946
and we could do nothing
but stand where we were...

1146
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:31,783
and get the water
and the lime all over us.

1147
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:34,786
Some of us lost our teeth
and our hair.

1148
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:39,290
And when the lime got wet, it just
boiled up, bubbling all over us.

1149
01:29:39,373 --> 01:29:44,337
Our hair fell out and our skin
became covered with sores.

1150
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:50,301
They said that if we were innocent,

1151
01:29:50,384 --> 01:29:53,304
they would beat us
until we were guilty,

1152
01:29:53,387 --> 01:29:58,142
and that if we were guilty, they
would beat us until we repent.

1153
01:30:04,148 --> 01:30:09,987
In a country where the people
don't hold national sovereignty,

1154
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:13,533
in a country where
the government has proven itself...

1155
01:30:13,616 --> 01:30:18,204
to be the enemy of the people,
the prisoners are the patriots.

1156
01:30:20,289 --> 01:30:26,754
And no matter how badly treated
we are, still we are proud,

1157
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:28,756
because at least we are free,

1158
01:30:28,881 --> 01:30:34,095
instead of enslaved as so many of
the so-called government officials.

1159
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:40,435
And so, you see,

1160
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:43,438
when a Vietnamese works
for peace and for liberty,

1161
01:30:45,064 --> 01:30:47,442
he is considered a communist.

1162
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:56,284
It is an honor for the communists to
have to work for peace and justice.

1163
01:30:58,911 --> 01:31:02,707
So it is the government which gives
validity to being a communist,

1164
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:04,709
because they continue to say...

1165
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:08,754
that the people who work for justice
and for peace are communists.

1166
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:12,508
You see?

1167
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:14,760
We were learning to
be good soldiers...

1168
01:31:14,844 --> 01:31:16,804
back when you're three, four,
five, six years old.

1169
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:21,225
That's when good ol' mom is telling you
to obey the local camp regulations.

1170
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:23,644
In this case, it's the house.

1171
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:27,064
And you start to learn
to respect authority.

1172
01:31:27,148 --> 01:31:30,067
And so, finally, lo and behold,
at 20, 22 years old,

1173
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:34,238
you find yourself in service and
maybe take that last and final step,

1174
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:39,410
where you become quite regimented...
in a military form of discipline.

1175
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:43,915
That stuff isn't worth the paper it's
written on, if the basis isn't there.

1176
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:47,460
You need that cornerstone that goes back
to childhood, and who's teaching you,

1177
01:31:47,543 --> 01:31:52,048
but good old moms,
women like yourselves.

1178
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:55,426
It's terrifying. When you're facing a
torture session with a bunch of gooks,

1179
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:57,428
it's gonna be pretty
darn miserable.

1180
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:59,793
No doubt about it. You're scared.
You're really petrified.

1181
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:02,767
But at the other side, you have
a bunch of women back there...

1182
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:05,436
telling you, "You better
do something," you know?

1183
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,773
That's the wrath of God. You don't want
100 women climbing down your back,

1184
01:32:08,856 --> 01:32:11,484
So you figure the
gooks aren't so bad.

1185
01:32:11,567 --> 01:32:13,528
So you press on.

1186
01:32:13,611 --> 01:32:16,280
In many respects,
the destiny of our country,

1187
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:19,617
and more personally,
the destiny of me,

1188
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:24,455
your men, your children...
is in your hands.

1189
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:27,959
If you are proud of the P.O. W. S
and personally of me,

1190
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:33,381
then you should be proud of yourselves,
because I was what you made me to be.

1191
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:37,885
As for my own view, uh, I thought
through as best I could...

1192
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:40,972
the meaning of Southeast Asia
to the United States in the 1950s,

1193
01:32:41,055 --> 01:32:43,307
Looking backward
and looking forward...

1194
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:46,978
in terms of what I know about the
dynamics of societies and so on.

1195
01:32:47,061 --> 01:32:50,022
And on balance...
It is an on-balance judgment...

1196
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:52,984
I came to the judgment that it's a
vital interest to the United States.

1197
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:55,570
I've never had any reason
to change that judgment.

1198
01:32:57,238 --> 01:33:01,617
And, uh, therefore, I, uh,

1199
01:33:01,742 --> 01:33:06,080
I do believe that what we have done
is generally right,

1200
01:33:06,164 --> 01:33:09,792
although I would have preferred
to have seen a different,

1201
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:11,919
more decisive military strategy.

1202
01:33:12,044 --> 01:33:14,338
Certainly, to me,

1203
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:19,093
the day you can say that a sacrifice
such as that is not worthwhile...

1204
01:33:19,218 --> 01:33:21,846
is the day that you've destroyed
all your real values...

1205
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:24,432
of what is worthwhile
and what isn't.

1206
01:33:24,557 --> 01:33:26,434
And there's no
question in my mind...

1207
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:30,021
that he and everybody else
that did what he did...

1208
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:32,857
there's no sacrifice
that is in vain.

1209
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:37,862
Absolutely none. Down the line, that's
the price you pay for freedom...

1210
01:33:37,945 --> 01:33:43,034
and that's the price that you pay for
the kind of stature that we have...

1211
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:47,789
and it's the kind of risk you take...
to preserve the ideals that we have.

1212
01:33:47,872 --> 01:33:49,791
He had just a tremendous
sense of humor...

1213
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:55,546
and just an amazing, instinctive sense
of what was important and what wasn't.

1214
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:58,716
I remember when I was getting ready
for our oldest daughter's wedding,

1215
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,886
and I was upset because something
or other wasn't going well,

1216
01:34:01,969 --> 01:34:05,306
and he called up from Pensacola and
he said, "How are thing's going?"

1217
01:34:05,389 --> 01:34:07,934
And I said, "Fine, Bing,
but such-and-such has happened."

1218
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:10,978
He said, "Oh, Mom,
don't sweat the small stuff."

1219
01:34:11,062 --> 01:34:13,231
You know,
it just made all the difference.

1220
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:16,067
I thought, "Gee. That really
is small stuff, you know?"

1221
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:18,236
And it was. Yeah.

1222
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:20,863
And it made the whole thing
much easier.

1223
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:25,576
And, of course, I came up in a tradition
where military service was...

1224
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:28,913
In World War II, there was no
question everybody was part of it.

1225
01:34:28,996 --> 01:34:31,499
There was not the kind
of dissension and so forth...

1226
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:36,129
that there has been surrounding
the Vietnam thing.

1227
01:34:36,212 --> 01:34:38,756
But I think that most of the
people of this country...

1228
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:41,592
are too busy
to get involved deeply...

1229
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,594
in, uh, uh,

1230
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:47,598
on, uh, the kind of things
that the dissenters do.

1231
01:34:47,682 --> 01:34:50,685
In other words, I think that really
the strength of our system,

1232
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:52,854
and I think it's a terrific system,

1233
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:57,358
is that you do rely on somebody like
President Nixon for leadership.

1234
01:34:57,483 --> 01:35:02,613
I think his team of people with him
are outstanding...

1235
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:05,783
and, to me,
the leadership that he has shown...

1236
01:35:05,867 --> 01:35:08,286
and decisions that he has made,

1237
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:13,291
uh, really have...
They're the kind of decisions...

1238
01:35:13,374 --> 01:35:15,793
I would expect from
the president of this country.

1239
01:35:15,877 --> 01:35:19,380
And the action he has taken
is the action I'd expect...

1240
01:35:19,505 --> 01:35:21,799
from the president of this country.

1241
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:25,970
I think the whole executive,

1242
01:35:26,053 --> 01:35:31,976
legislative and judicial system
that we have is superb.

1243
01:35:32,059 --> 01:35:36,814
It has worked many, many... far better
than any other system I'm aware of...

1244
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:40,485
and brought us
to our state of power...

1245
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:45,656
and, uh, really,
of international stature...

1246
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:51,579
that we have a responsibility
to stay with and to uphold.

1247
01:35:54,665 --> 01:35:57,001
What did your son want to become?

1248
01:35:57,084 --> 01:35:59,921
I suspect he would have
gone into the newspaper.

1249
01:36:00,004 --> 01:36:03,174
He actually had just got a job
with the New York Times...

1250
01:36:03,257 --> 01:36:08,387
when he went into the, uh, O.C.S.

1251
01:36:09,597 --> 01:36:14,018
And he'd worked for newspapers
in the summer...

1252
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:16,979
while he was at college.

1253
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:22,693
I suppose that it's like any pain.

1254
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:26,739
You don't remember pain too well...
afterwards.

1255
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:48,636
Thank you. Thank you very much,
Mr. President, dear people.

1256
01:36:48,761 --> 01:36:52,390
I'm thrilled to be here with you guys.
This is what I like... a captive audience.

1257
01:36:59,856 --> 01:37:02,400
It is always the custom
at a dinner at the White House...

1258
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:05,820
to have a toast
to the honored guest.

1259
01:37:05,945 --> 01:37:08,823
The difficulty tonight is that there
are so many honored guests...

1260
01:37:08,948 --> 01:37:11,576
that we would be drinking
all night and into the day.

1261
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:22,378
Somebody just said,
"What's wrong with that?"

1262
01:37:24,046 --> 01:37:26,966
The most difficult decision that I
have made since being president...

1263
01:37:27,049 --> 01:37:30,261
was on December the
18th of last year.

1264
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:32,346
There...

1265
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:41,814
And there were many occasions...

1266
01:37:41,898 --> 01:37:44,734
in the 10-day period
after the decision was made...

1267
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:47,779
when I wondered whether
this country really supported it.

1268
01:37:50,156 --> 01:37:54,952
After having met each one of our
honored guests this evening...

1269
01:37:55,036 --> 01:38:00,458
and after having talked to them,
I think that all of us...

1270
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:02,794
would like to join
in a round of applause...

1271
01:38:02,877 --> 01:38:07,131
for the brave men that took
those B-52s in and did the job.

1272
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:37,430
My eight-year-old
daughter was killed.

1273
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:41,559
And my three-year-old son.

1274
01:39:41,642 --> 01:39:44,645
A son, three years old, killed.

1275
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:49,484
Nixon, murderer of civilians.

1276
01:39:51,319 --> 01:39:55,406
What have I done to Nixon so that
he comes here to bomb my country?

1277
01:39:57,033 --> 01:39:59,911
My daughter died right here.

1278
01:39:59,994 --> 01:40:02,497
She was feeding the pigs.

1279
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:04,499
She was so sweet.

1280
01:40:06,167 --> 01:40:09,587
She is dead. The pigs are alive.

1281
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:14,926
My mother and my children
took shelter here.

1282
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:17,011
Here they died.

1283
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:23,601
The planes came from over there.

1284
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:25,603
No targets here.

1285
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:28,022
Only rice fields and houses.

1286
01:40:29,524 --> 01:40:32,777
I'll give you
my daughter's beautiful shirt.

1287
01:40:34,529 --> 01:40:37,031
Take it back to the United States.

1288
01:40:38,533 --> 01:40:40,660
Tell them what happened here.

1289
01:40:40,785 --> 01:40:43,037
My daughter is dead.

1290
01:40:44,372 --> 01:40:46,707
She will never wear
the shirt again.

1291
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:54,382
Throw the shirt in Nixon's face.

1292
01:40:56,050 --> 01:41:00,388
Tell them she was only
a little schoolgirl.

1293
01:43:22,655 --> 01:43:25,700
Well, the Oriental...

1294
01:43:25,825 --> 01:43:29,495
doesn't put the same high price
on life as does a Westerner.

1295
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:34,041
Life is plentiful,
life is cheap in the Orient.

1296
01:43:35,668 --> 01:43:38,671
And, uh, as the, uh,

1297
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:44,218
philosophy of the, uh,
of the Orient, uh,

1298
01:43:45,887 --> 01:43:47,889
uh, expresses it, uh,

1299
01:43:49,557 --> 01:43:53,519
uh, life is, uh,

1300
01:43:54,896 --> 01:43:57,273
is not important.

1301
01:44:07,575 --> 01:44:09,911
During the missions,
after the missions,

1302
01:44:09,994 --> 01:44:12,079
the result of what I was doing...

1303
01:44:12,205 --> 01:44:16,834
the result of this-this game,

1304
01:44:16,918 --> 01:44:21,339
this, uh, exercise
of my technical expertise...

1305
01:44:21,422 --> 01:44:23,508
never really dawned on me.

1306
01:44:23,591 --> 01:44:29,180
That reality of the screams
or the people being blown away...

1307
01:44:29,263 --> 01:44:31,265
or their homeland being destroyed,

1308
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:37,772
uh, just was not a part
of what I thought about.

1309
01:45:03,506 --> 01:45:06,217
Uh, we, as Americans,
have never experienced that.

1310
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:10,638
We've never experienced
any kind of devastation.

1311
01:45:14,934 --> 01:45:18,813
When I was there, I never saw
a child that got burned by napalm.

1312
01:45:22,024 --> 01:45:25,236
I didn't drop napalm, but I
dropped other things just as bad.

1313
01:45:25,319 --> 01:45:29,407
I dropped C.B.U. s, which
can't destroy anything.

1314
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:31,993
It's meant for people.
It's an antipersonnel weapon.

1315
01:45:32,076 --> 01:45:34,745
We used to drop canister upon
canister of these things...

1316
01:45:34,829 --> 01:45:38,916
with 200 tumbling little balls in
there about this big around...

1317
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,252
with something like
600 pellets in each ball...

1318
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:43,921
that would blow out
as soon as it hit the ground,

1319
01:45:44,005 --> 01:45:46,257
uh, and shred people to pieces.

1320
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:48,593
They couldn't be gotten out
in many cases.

1321
01:45:48,676 --> 01:45:52,263
People would suffer. They would live,
but they would suffer, you know?

1322
01:45:52,346 --> 01:45:54,265
Then often they would
die afterwards.

1323
01:45:54,348 --> 01:45:57,935
This would cause people to have
to take care of them, you know?

1324
01:45:58,019 --> 01:46:00,354
But I look at my children now...

1325
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:06,944
and, uh, I don't know what
would happen if, uh...

1326
01:46:07,028 --> 01:46:10,990
uh, what I would think about
if someone napalmed them.

1327
01:46:43,314 --> 01:46:46,025
Do you think we've learned
anything from all this?

1328
01:46:47,527 --> 01:46:49,695
I think we're trying not to.

1329
01:46:50,947 --> 01:46:53,324
I think I'm trying
not to sometimes.

1330
01:46:53,407 --> 01:46:55,409
I can't even cry easily.

1331
01:46:56,410 --> 01:47:00,331
From my, uh, my manhood image.

1332
01:47:01,707 --> 01:47:04,877
I think Americans have tried...

1333
01:47:05,002 --> 01:47:08,005
We've all tried very hard...

1334
01:47:08,089 --> 01:47:10,007
to escape
what we've learned in Vietnam,

1335
01:47:10,091 --> 01:47:14,345
to not come to the logical conclusions
of what's happened there.

1336
01:47:14,429 --> 01:47:17,181
You know, the military
does the same thing.

1337
01:47:17,265 --> 01:47:19,392
They don't realize that, um,

1338
01:47:21,102 --> 01:47:23,438
people fighting for
their own freedom...

1339
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:29,861
uh, are not gonna be stopped...

1340
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:32,029
by just changing your tactics,

1341
01:47:32,113 --> 01:47:35,032
adding a little bit more
sophisticated technology over here,

1342
01:47:35,116 --> 01:47:39,704
improving the tactics we used last time,
not making quite the same mistakes.

1343
01:47:39,787 --> 01:47:43,374
Uh, you know, I think history operates
a little different than that.

1344
01:47:43,458 --> 01:47:48,045
And I think that those kind of
forces are not gonna be stopped.

1345
01:47:48,129 --> 01:47:51,716
I think Americans have
worked extremely hard...

1346
01:47:52,967 --> 01:47:57,221
not to see, uh, the criminality,

1347
01:47:57,305 --> 01:48:01,225
uh, that their officials
and their policy makers,

1348
01:48:01,309 --> 01:48:04,771
uh, have exhibited.

1349
01:49:42,910 --> 01:49:45,538
Number one! Number one!

1350
01:50:42,637 --> 01:50:44,806
It's your country, not a toilet,
you bastards!

1351
01:50:44,931 --> 01:50:48,684
They oughta go to Cuba. That's
where they belong. Or Russia.

1352
01:50:53,856 --> 01:50:57,941
Boo!

1353
01:50:58,111 --> 01:51:00,154
You motherfuckers!

1354
01:51:05,993 --> 01:51:08,913
Man, let me talk to somebody.
I was in Vietnam.

1355
01:51:08,996 --> 01:51:10,915
I was a platoon leader over there.

1356
01:51:10,998 --> 01:51:13,334
What is this?
What the hell is this?

1357
01:51:13,417 --> 01:51:15,795
We were the ones that got shot.

1358
01:51:15,878 --> 01:51:19,173
You guys were over there too
with your damn cameras.

1359
01:51:22,677 --> 01:51:25,263
Holy... Make my day!

1360
01:51:40,194 --> 01:51:42,196
Come on, smile a little bit!

1361
01:51:42,321 --> 01:51:44,282
Come on! Smile! Smile!

1362
01:51:44,365 --> 01:51:47,869
Be happy! Smile!
Everything isn't bad!
