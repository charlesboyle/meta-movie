That kingdom can never
be surrendered.

1410
02:50:25,732 --> 02:50:27,893
What should I do?

1411
02:50:30,537 --> 02:50:34,598
I'm still the queen of Acre,
Ashkelon, Tripoli.

1412
02:50:35,709 --> 02:50:38,405
Decide not to be a queen...

1413
02:50:38,512 --> 02:50:40,980
and I will come to you.

1414
02:51:10,277 --> 02:51:12,575
The perfect knight.

1415
02:51:12,679 --> 02:51:14,806
Is that what you
think you are, is it?

1416
02:51:29,796 --> 02:51:31,821
We are all of us what we do.

1417
02:52:42,035 --> 02:52:44,003
Do it.

1418
02:52:48,909 --> 02:52:51,207
When you rise again...

1419
02:52:51,311 --> 02:52:53,336
if you rise...

1420
02:52:54,948 --> 02:52:57,781
rise a knight.

1421
02:54:11,124 --> 02:54:13,718

1422
02:54:15,795 --> 02:54:18,423

1423
02:54:18,531 --> 02:54:20,795
I will not keep it.

1424
02:54:22,235 --> 02:54:25,033
Thank you.

1425
02:54:26,640 --> 02:54:28,870
And if God does not love you...

1426
02:54:28,975 --> 02:54:32,934
how could you have done all the things
that you have done?

1427
02:54:34,414 --> 02:54:36,644
Peace be upon you.
