<i>What's gonna happen</i>

3
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,483
<i>when the red lights go out
at 2:00 in the afternoon?</i>

4
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,170
<i>MotoGP race time.</i>

5
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,643
<i>In the next 45 minutes,
25 laps, 70 miles.</i>

6
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,489
<i>Wheel to wheel, side by side
at 200 miles an hour.</i>

7
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,650
<i>What's gonna happen?</i>

8
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,843
<i>On a good day, the answer doesn't
come until the very end.</i>

9
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,084
<i>The race is a battle
to the finish line.</i>

10
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:31,049
<i>June 15th, 2009
was a very good day.</i>

11
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,684
<i>The Catalan Grand Prix,
two laps to go.</i>

12
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,364
<i>Thirty-year-old Italian
multiple MotoGP champion</i>

13
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,165
<i>Valentino Rossi,</i>

14
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,807
<i>against his 21-year-old Spanish
teammate, Jorge Lorenzo.</i>

15
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,485
<i>"Teammate" is a
misleading term.</i>

16
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,727
<i>They are bitter rivals
in the same colors</i>

17
00:01:49,762 --> 00:01:51,051
<i>on the same bikes.</i>

18
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,527
<i>Rossi is used to
being number one.</i>

19
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,404
<i>Lorenzo wants to be.</i>

20
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,568
<i>Lorenzo has won two of the
five races so far this season,</i>

21
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,210
<i>the champion only one.</i>

22
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,245
<i>Now, Rossi faces losing to Lorenzo in
front of the Spaniard's home crowd</i>

23
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,562
<i>and losing another five points
to him in the championship.</i>

24
00:02:08,597 --> 00:02:10,927
<i>Victory would put
Rossi level on points.</i>

25
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,203
<i>More importantly, it would
put Lorenzo in his place,</i>

26
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,442
<i>at least for the time being.</i>

27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,850
<i>A hundred thousand fans are watching
the battle around the track,</i>

28
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,805
<i>millions more on TV
around the world.</i>

29
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,405
<i>Here he
comes, down the straight,</i>

30
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,365
<i>Jorge Lorenzo's
gonna go through,</i>

31
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,925
<i>and he's gone through
Valentino Rossi.</i>

32
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,685
<i>Lorenzo brakes,
closes the door.</i>

33
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,160
<i>Very smart move, fairing
to fairing in the chicane.</i>

34
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,601
<i>He's trying to get past.
Jorge won't let him.</i>

35
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,045
<i>Final lap. Lorenzo in
front, Rossi behind.</i>

36
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,166
<i>Attention, attention. They've
been together all race long.</i>

37
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,762
<i>Of all those
watching, nobody knows better</i>

38
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,804
<i>than Rossi's own team where his
last chances to overtake are.</i>

39
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,405
Faster, faster,
faster here!

40
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,046
Go, go!
More, more faster!

41
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,131
<i>Rossi's best chance
is in the next few corners.</i>

42
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:09,124
<i>From Turn 10 onwards
it's all but impossible.</i>

43
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,605
<i>Haifa lap
to go here at Barcelona-</i>

44
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,444
<i>Jorge's beating him
hand to hand.</i>

45
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,887
<i>It's crazy, he'll be
leading the championship.</i>

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,085
<i>Go Valentino, go!
Head to head.</i>

47
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,841
<i>Lorenzo's carrying
a lot of speed out of Turn 9.</i>

48
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,644
<i>There's no way
through there.</i>

49
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,849
<i>Oh, mamma mia!
Mamma mia! Mamma mia!</i>

50
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,285
<i>On the inside,
Jorge's really got him.</i>

51
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,688
<i>Three corners to win
the Catalan Grand Prix.</i>

52
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,561
<i>He said
to me before this weekend,</i>

53
00:03:38,596 --> 00:03:40,143
<i>if you go into
these corners first,</i>

54
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,691
<i>you know you're
gonna win the race.</i>

55
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,725
<i>Almost impossible. Very, very difficult.
Lorenzo ahead, Rossi behind.</i>

56
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,370
<i>There's no room here.</i>

57
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,010
<i>When Jorge
closed the door on me in Turn 9,</i>

58
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,521
I say, "Fuck, I have to
try in the last corner."

59
00:03:56,556 --> 00:03:58,921
<i>But I don't know
if I crash.</i>

60
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,327
And I hope, if I crash, we
crash together. Not alone.

61
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,326
<i>And from that moment, I tried to
stay very, very, very close to him.</i>

62
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,688
<i>And I know I have a small
chance on the last corner.</i>

63
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,565
<i>It is strange</i>

64
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,923
<i>because I thought, "Okay, if
I can be the maximum fast,</i>

65
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,404
"the maximum quick I can be
in the last two corners,

66
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,760
"he can't overtake me."

67
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,845
<i>I just ride to go fast,</i>

68
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,363
so some part of me thought, "Okay,
Valentino is going to try."

69
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,691
So, I didn't want to close
more, because Valentino is...

70
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,731
He's going to try the same.
So, maybe we could crash.

71
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:42,882
And another
part of me thought,

72
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,530
<i>"Valentino is not
going to try,</i>

73
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,046
<i>"it's impossible
to pass there."</i>

74
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,047
<i>The surprise
was the important thing,</i>

75
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,045
<i>because also
Jorge don't expect.</i>

76
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,606
<i>When we arrived
to the last corner,</i>

77
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,601
I said, "I have to brake a little bit
later than him, but not too much."

78
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,930
So, when he brake, I brake a bit
later, like five, six meters later,

79
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,170
and I try to put my bike
at 180 kilometers an hour

80
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,163
in 35 centimeters.

81
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,568
And I say,
"Maybe now I crash."

82
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,611
<i>At the maximum braking,
when I go to the apex,</i>

83
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:20,841
<i>I feel the front go away.</i>

84
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,609
And I say, "Please, don't
slide more because we crash."

85
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,161
But the front stayed.

86
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,084
The Bridgestone
front tire is a great tire.

87
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,606
<i>What a race. He's got one corner left.
He's going for the inside.</i>

88
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,809
<i>And Rossi, he manages
something in the final corner.</i>

89
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,704
<i>I don't believe it.
I can't believe it.</i>

90
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:54,489
<i>He's done it.
I can't believe it.</i>

91
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,851
<i>It's impossible. Bravo!</i>

92
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,162
And we arrived on the finish line
like this, but a little bit in front.

93
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:03,685
<i>And it was
a great emotion.</i>

94
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,171
<i>What a race.
What a pass.</i>

95
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,201
<i>How did he do it?
Rossi's done it.</i>

96
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,210
<i>Valentino Rossi is one
of the most incredible riders...</i>

97
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,803
<i>I make
a really good race-</i>

98
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,009
<i>The only mistake I made
was in the last corner.</i>

99
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,327
<i>You always have something to
learn every day in racing.</i>

100
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,725
Rossi!

101
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,042
<i>They come and they go.</i>

102
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,891
<i>And they go as fast
as they possibly can.</i>

103
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,722
<i>For over 60 years, the fastest
motorcycle racers in the world</i>

104
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:19,563
<i>have dreamed
the same dream.</i>

105
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,441
<i>To win at the highest level.</i>

106
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,966
<i>The Grand Prix
World Championship.</i>

107
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,122
<i>Most of them last
a few seasons.</i>

108
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,563
<i>A rare few,
a decade or more.</i>

109
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:32,926
<i>And some,
just a few races.</i>

110
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,520
<i>Most walk away.
Some do not.</i>

111
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,969
<i>Safer now than it was,
but how can it ever be safe?</i>

112
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,362
<i>Wheel to wheel at 200 miles
an hour on a motorcycle.</i>

113
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,608
<i>People die doing this.</i>

114
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,768
<i>But most of them live.</i>

115
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:50,205
<i>Really live.</i>

116
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,928
<i>Over 750 riders
since 1949,</i>

117
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,161
<i>all brave, all fast,</i>

118
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,401
<i>and almost all destined to fail
at the ultimate challenge.</i>

119
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,563
<i>In 60 years, only 24 riders have won
the premier class world championship.</i>

120
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,607
<i>Of them, a few
won multiple titles.</i>

121
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,004
<i>And at the very summit of the
sport stand just two men</i>

122
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,765
<i>who have won the title
more than five times each,</i>

123
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,105
<i>Giacomo Agostini, who raced
in the '60s and the '70s</i>

124
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,450
<i>and took the premier
class crown eight times.</i>

125
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,481
<i>And Valentino Rossi, on his way
to his seventh title in 2009.</i>

126
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,765
<i>How many more races?</i>

127
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,280
<i>How many more
championships can he win?</i>

128
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,762
<i>Is he the greatest of all time?
Time will tell.</i>

129
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,169
<i>But for every year
that you push your bike</i>

130
00:08:44,204 --> 00:08:45,685
<i>and your body
to the limit,</i>

131
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,525
<i>you push your luck
to the limit, as well.</i>

132
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,965
<i>You can't be
the fastest forever.</i>

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,800
<i>And when the red lights go
out, nobody's looking back.</i>

134
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,484
<i>The past is behind you.</i>

135
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,046
<i>And there's only
one question.</i>

136
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,451
<i>Who's fastest now?</i>

137
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,801
<i>I like to ride
motorcycles- I enjoy a lot-</i>

138
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,565
<i>I go in the best
circuit in the world</i>

139
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,640
<i>with the best bike
in the world,</i>

140
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,805
<i>try to go
as fast as possible.</i>

141
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,084
Until I have this taste
and this passion

142
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,481
for riding motorcycles,

143
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,209
why I have
to stay at home?

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,641
<i>Rossi won six of
the 18 Grand Prixs in 2009,</i>

145
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:34,165
<i>Lorenzo, four.</i>

146
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,891
<i>Another world championship
for the Italian</i>

147
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,440
<i>and a step closer for Lorenzo,
who finished second.</i>

148
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,410
Valentino has won
a lot of world titles.

149
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,485
And Valentino has done a lot of
things for the motorcycle sport.

150
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,362
<i>So, you must have
a lot of respect for him.</i>

151
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,410
But for me,
he is not a god.

152
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,050
<i>If you work really hard,</i>

153
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,250
<i>if your technique is extremely
good, then you can beat him.</i>

154
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,767
<i>As important as winning
races, is not crashing out of them.</i>

155
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,050
<i>In 2009, Rossi failed to finish
only once, at Indianapolis.</i>

156
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,122
<i>At the next Grand Prix
in San Marino, his home race,</i>

157
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,843
<i>he mocked his stupid-ass mistake at
Indy with a special helmet design</i>

158
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,045
<i>and a victory celebration
to go with it.</i>

159
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,884
<i>Lorenzo crashed
out of four races in 2009.</i>

160
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,644
<i>There goes up to 100 points
in the championship.</i>

161
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,006
<i>You can't afford to crash, and
you can't afford to get hurt.</i>

162
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,568
<i>But both are inevitable.</i>

163
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,164
<i>Where do MotoGP riders
go in the winter?</i>

164
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,528
<i>Onto the dirt for fun,
and they say, for fitness.</i>

165
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,768
<i>Training in
motocross is very important.</i>

166
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,161
<i>For physical, for mental,
it's very important.</i>

167
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,687
And motocross is very fun,
I like a lot motocross.

168
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,486
Valentino will not race
motocross anymore.

169
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,123
I have big, big pressure from
my father that say always,

170
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:20,360
"No, you don't go
with motocross.

171
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,283
"You're stupid.
It's too dangerous."

172
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,242
<i>I think a lot of MotoGP riders
have injury with motocross.</i>

173
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,687
<i>Because we have
the mind to go fast,</i>

174
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,330
<i>but we don't have
the technique.</i>

175
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,767
<i>Motocross is very
dangerous for the jumps,</i>

176
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,484
<i>it's more dangerous
for the bumps.</i>

177
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,007
<i>When we crash with MotoGP
on the asphalt, you slide.</i>

178
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,766
Sometimes in motocross in the
mud, you crash and you stop.

179
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,686
<i>2010, the French Grand
Prix, third race of the season.</i>

180
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,600
<i>Valentino Rossi
is walking wounded.</i>

181
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,570
<i>He injured his shoulder
in a motocross crash in Italy</i>

182
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,962
<i>a few days after winning the
first MotoGP race in Qatar.</i>

183
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,010
Valentino understands
with this accident

184
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,166
that motocross is not the
right way to drive the bike.

185
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,086
I have a small crack
to the bone, here,

186
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,650
but I think now
the bone is okay,

187
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,165
because it's more
than one month.

188
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,965
<i>Jorge Lorenzo
finished second in Qatar,</i>

189
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,407
<i>riding with a broken thumb
after a pre-season crash</i>

190
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,084
<i>on a dirt bike.</i>

191
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,410
<i>He won the next
race in Spain,</i>

192
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,848
<i>ahead of his compatriot
and archrival, Dani Pedrosa.</i>

193
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,002
<i>Touching in the last corner
and beating him in the last lap</i>

194
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,003
<i>has been 100% adrenaline.</i>

195
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,691
<i>Lorenzo then staged
a post-race celebration</i>

196
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,127
<i>to rival Rossi's
own theatrics.</i>

197
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,047
<i>At Le Mans, MotoGP
rookie Alvaro Bautista</i>

198
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,530
<i>is also walking wounded after a
motocross accident a week earlier.</i>

199
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,205
When I crashed, I
thought, "Okay, I broke."

200
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,370
<i>I'm here because I think
I can try to ride. No?</i>

201
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,245
Bautista had a compound fracture of his
left clavicle operated on a week ago.

202
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,823
He also had thoracic
bruising and broken ribs.

203
00:13:17,858 --> 00:13:23,366
<i>He wants to ride, and
that is quite incredible.</i>

204
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,087
<i>Bautista is one of
six MotoGP rookies in 2010.</i>

205
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,961
<i>They may be new to MotoGP, but
they're not new to each other.</i>

206
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,130
<i>They've raced each other for years
in the junior MotoGP categories.</i>

207
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,085
<i>Bautista and fellow Spaniard,
Héctor Barberé</i>

208
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,408
<i>have some history with the
Italian, Marco Simoncelli.</i>

209
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,403
<i>I like a lot
when there is a physical fight</i>

210
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,365
<i>in the last lap,
to try to win the race.</i>

211
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,605
<i>You fight with the
other rider, you touch.</i>

212
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,326
During the race, you want
to kill the other rider,

213
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,609
but after the race,
you give him the hand,

214
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,848
<i>and you go to drink
a beer together.</i>

215
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,128
Okay, you are fighting
and you want to pass bad.

216
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,131
I think he is different, because
he's very ready to hit you.

217
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,891
<i>Every time something happens,
they come to the race direction,</i>

218
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,810
and they say,
"Simoncelli touched me.

219
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,287
"You have to
disqualify him."

220
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,127
<i>And for me, it's not the true
spirit of the motorcycle race.</i>

221
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,805
<i>For me, it's normal.</i>

222
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,920
And also, if you see, Lorenzo and
Pedrosa in the last race touched,

223
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,367
but nobody say nothing.

224
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,131
<i>Simoncelli
sometimes is very hard.</i>

225
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,802
I am his friend, so with
me, he is more soft.

226
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,566
<i>But especially with Bautista,
Barbera, always hard, hard fight.</i>

227
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,608
But he says they are girls.

228
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,284
Yes.

229
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,841
<i>The rookies have graduated</i>

230
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,400
<i>from 150 mile-an-hour
lightweight machines</i>

231
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,211
<i>to 170 mile-an-hour
middleweights.</i>

232
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,490
<i>Now, it's time to go racing on
210 mile-an-hour MotoGP bikes.</i>

233
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,524
<i>There are no better riders than
the men they are up against,</i>

234
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,400
<i>and there are no faster bikes.
This is it.</i>

235
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,643
<i>The beginning of the
season, it was quite difficult.</i>

236
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,284
<i>In Malaysia, I crashed,
I had a big crash.</i>

237
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,601
<i>It was a very
strange crash,</i>

238
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,129
because entering the corner,
I lose the front of my bike

239
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,244
and with the leg, I pick up
the bike for some meters,

240
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,922
<i>but after, the bike
retake the grip,</i>

241
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,321
<i>and I had a very
bad high side.</i>

242
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,286
After that moment, I don't
remember very well what happened.

243
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,360
<i>I am afraid
when I crash</i>

244
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,441
<i>and I understand that
I can do nothing.</i>

245
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,251
So, in this moment,
I am a little bit afraid,

246
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,288
not little bit afraid.

247
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,169
<i>The sixth MotoGP
rookie is American Ben Spies.</i>

248
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,963
<i>Unlike the others, he's come from
the world of superbike racing</i>

249
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,168
<i>and has the most
to learn in MotoGP.</i>

250
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,251
<i>The Grand Prix tracks, riders and
machines are all new to him.</i>

251
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,331
<i>On the other side
of the track,</i>

252
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,165
<i>Bautista has an even
worse high side crash,</i>

253
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,040
<i>where the rear wheel slides
sideways, and then regains grip</i>

254
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,521
<i>and flicks the rider
into the air.</i>

255
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,809
<i>Meanwhile, Simoncelli experiences
the much preferred low side fall,</i>

256
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,166
<i>where the front
wheel slides out</i>

257
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,722
<i>and the rider drops just
a few inches to the ground.</i>

258
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,263
The rider has decided
not to ride in Le Mans

259
00:16:53,298 --> 00:16:57,606
<i>and be ready for the
next race in Mugello.</i>

260
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,846
<i>Ben Spies had a big fall with bruising to
his foot and dislocation of the ankle.</i>

261
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,882
If all goes well, and he has the heart
I saw today, he will do the race.

262
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,002
<i>Pedrosa,
two quick laps on the mount,</i>

263
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,085
puts a 10th of a second into
Valentino Rossi, who's second,

264
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,605
Stoner,
who's now third.

265
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,842
<i>To the last lap
for Jorge Lorenzo.</i>

266
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,090
<i>Still,
it's Valentino Rossi</i>

267
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,084
<i>with just a five-hundredth
of-a-second advantage</i>

268
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,323
<i>on the pole position,
ahead of Jorge Lorenzo.</i>

269
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,085
<i>Here's Casey Stoner,
2007 World Champion.</i>

270
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,050
<i>It's gonna be touch and go
whether Casey gets on the front row.</i>

271
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,242
I don't think he's gonna be
able to get on the front row.

272
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,324
I can't see it. No way.
I can't see it either.

273
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,205
<i>Pole. It's the first pole of 2010.
It's Valentino Rossi.</i>

274
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,009
<i>Didn't think
he'd be able to do that</i>

275
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,650
<i>at the beginning
of the session, Julian.</i>

276
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,609
He was quite
a way back.

277
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,604
But how many times have we been
fooled by Valentino Rossi?

278
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,366
<i>"Giacomo, watch out,
just 18 races left. "</i>

279
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,408
<i>"Thank you, Stefania,"
who is mum.</i>

280
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,927
That's a very Italian sort of
thing, a thank you to the mother.

281
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,683
<i>Valentino is a student
of history, he knows very well,</i>

282
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,367
<i>and he knows he's within
range of Agostini's records.</i>

283
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,162
<i>He wants to say, "I won
the most Grand Prixs ever."</i>

284
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,851
<i>He's on 104 at the moment
here in late May, 2010.</i>

285
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,124
<i>He's got 123 to get
to beatAgostini's 122.</i>

286
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,246
<i>Valentino is now 31,</i>

287
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,807
<i>and he's having to
dig very deep indeed</i>

288
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,090
<i>to fight off these youngsters, who
are immune to his mind games.</i>

289
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,328
<i>Rossi is still the king.</i>

290
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,047
<i>We're looking for the person
who is going to depose him.</i>

291
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,204
<i>On Sunday, one of the worst
parts is the nerves you feel.</i>

292
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,004
<i>There is something important
that is gonna happen.</i>

293
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,690
<i>I hate this feeling.</i>

294
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,565
<i>Meditation
helped me a lot,</i>

295
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,406
<i>I just turn on the sunglasses
and I hear my music</i>

296
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,847
<i>and I just close
my eyes and relax.</i>

297
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,684
<i>Like Bruce Lee, no?</i>

298
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,491
<i>Be water, my friend</i>

299
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,363
<i>I always feel a
personal connection with the bike,</i>

300
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,330
<i>because I think
the bike has a soul.</i>

301
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,722
<i>I always make a personal
feeling together.</i>

302
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,802
<i>I always speak
with the bike.</i>

303
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,407
When the bike arrive in January,
it is like with a girlfriend.

304
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:57,168
<i>MotoGP is a team sport. But
when you start for the race,</i>

305
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,130
<i>for the crucial moment, you
are alone with your bike.</i>

306
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,885
<i>When you are on the
track, you have to be flowing,</i>

307
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,645
<i>and you have to be
enjoying the moment.</i>

308
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,245
<i>Be water, my friend.</i>

309
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,646
<i>You go for the finish line, and
you try to be the fastest.</i>

310
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,885
<i>And it seems
a little bit stupid,</i>

311
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,924
<i>20 riders making the
same way, lap by lap.</i>

312
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,082
<i>But this simple thing
is very complicated.</i>

313
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:40,566
<i>It's very important to be
faster, but also to be clever, quiet</i>

314
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,085
<i>and don't feel
a lot of the pressure.</i>

315
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,445
<i>I think motorcycle
racing is more fun,</i>

316
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,484
<i>because with motorcycles,
it's more a battle sport</i>

317
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:52,125
<i>with the other guys.</i>

318
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,688
<i>I follow the philosophy
of thinking outside the race.</i>

319
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,923
<i>But when you are on the bike,
when you are riding,</i>

320
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,083
<i>it's better not to think and
to act with your instincts.</i>

321
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,209
<i>If you're always thinking
about your competitors,</i>

322
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,164
<i>you don't put your limit
higher and higher.</i>

323
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,481
Today,

324
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,762
if I have to be honest,
it was easier than I expected.

325
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,883
It is very important for me,
because it gives me the confidence

326
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,327
that I can win
two races in a row.

327
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,641
<i>It seems that
he is always happy,</i>

328
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,449
<i>because he is
a really good actor.</i>

329
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,729
He knows how to create this
good feeling with the people,

330
00:22:00,764 --> 00:22:03,205
with the people who
are looking at the TV.

331
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,403
<i>But every human has bad
moments in his life,</i>

332
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,324
<i>and for sure, he was
not very comfortable</i>

333
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,927
when he had been defeated
two races in a row with me

334
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,087
in the same bike.

335
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,324
<i>So for sure, he goes into the Mugello
Grand Prix with some pressure.</i>

336
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,162
<i>Young people are coming,</i>

337
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,040
but how close we are from
Valentino, we don't know.

338
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,082
We will know
at the end of the year.

339
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,284
<i>After six seasons
in the smaller MotoGP classes</i>

340
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,131
<i>and double 250cc
World Championships,</i>

341
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,040
<i>Jorge Lorenzo moved up
to the premier class in 2008.</i>

342
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,691
<i>His debut was nothing
less than astonishing.</i>

343
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,963
<i>A seven-race odyssey
from heaven to hell.</i>

344
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,245
I made pole position in the first
race of my life in MotoGP.

345
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,767
<i>I finished second
in the race.</i>

346
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,123
<i>I repeated with the pole
position in the second race.</i>

347
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,964
<i>I finished third.</i>

348
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,645
<i>And I won the third race,
also in the pole position.</i>

349
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,324
<i>For me, it was so easy</i>

350
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,569
<i>and I was beating all the
riders in my first year.</i>

351
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,811
<i>I didn't understand
why it's so easy.</i>

352
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,251
<i>The China Grand Prix, I didn't
get a good pace suddenly, no?</i>

353
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,649
<i>So, I feel that
I must push.</i>

354
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,925
<i>It was a terrific crash.
I broke two ankles.</i>

355
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,682
<i>The day after, I finished
fourth in the practice.</i>

356
00:23:40,717 --> 00:23:43,524
<i>The day after, I also
finished fourth in the race.</i>

357
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,170
<i>I crashed during the
practice on Le Mans,</i>

358
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,970
<i>the next race
after China.</i>

359
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,689
<i>I crashed, but I didn't fail
this race. I finished second.</i>

360
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,566
<i>But when I crashed in
Montmelo, I got unconscious.</i>

361
00:24:25,601 --> 00:24:27,164
Like a boxer, when...
Yeah.

362
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,242
<i>I didn't remember anything.</i>

363
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,727
<i>Then I realized
what I was doing.</i>

364
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,089
<i>I realized that if I continued
like that, maybe I can die.</i>

365
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,849
<i>So then it comes,</i>

366
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,081
the fear.

367
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,202
Some riders, after big crashes,
they get this fear of the bike

368
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,365
<i>and they never
go fast again.</i>

369
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,563
<i>And they must retire.
Some others...</i>

370
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,725
<i>Maybe I am of this other,</i>

371
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,764
take this disadvantage
and make this an advantage.

372
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,285
He was in here with
concussion for almost a week.

373
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,285
<i>It scared him a bit.</i>

374
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,723
All of us feel fear. The
thing is to overcome it.

375
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,969
<i>Lorenzo had another
huge crash at the US Grand Prix.</i>

376
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,122
<i>He came back to take
two podium finishes</i>

377
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,282
<i>in the second half
of the season,</i>

378
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,887
<i>and finished his first year
in MotoGP in fourth position.</i>

379
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,406
<i>Here, motorcycles are more
important than football.</i>

380
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,960
<i>Here, motorcycles
are number one.</i>

381
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:59,685
We were hoping
for a great rider,

382
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,604
and we got the greatest.

383
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,605
The miracle of Valentino.

384
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,204
Valentino and his motorcycle
flying towards the stars.

385
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,841
<i>He was tiny when
he first came here,</i>

386
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,208
<i>and he collected
Japanese toy figurines.</i>

387
00:26:30,243 --> 00:26:35,525
He always loved
Japanese things.

388
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,203
<i>He was not a normal child.</i>

389
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:44,241
At three, he was riding
bikes with Graziano.

390
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,801
Not normal.

391
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,721
<i>Valentino could have
done something else.</i>

392
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,771
But his father led him to it
when he was four years old.

393
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,089
I didn't push him,
you understand?

394
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,367
This happened
without saying.

395
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,922
He was the despair
of the police.

396
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,048
When he races, we all dream. When
he races, everything changes.

397
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,881
<i>I love watching the races.</i>

398
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:26,730
I had a Lambretta motorcycle.

399
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,245
<i>Number 46,
from my father.</i>

400
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,602
<i>The first race he won,
he had 46, in '79,</i>

401
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,722
<i>the year I was born
so I don't change,</i>

402
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,045
<i>because all the people
know me for the 46.</i>

403
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,927
<i>And it's easy. If you switch on the
television and see, "Ah! 46, Rossi!"</i>

404
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,048
My phone number
is 90-12-46.

405
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,967
<i>Valentino is and always
will be a humble person</i>

406
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,691
from Tavullia, like us.

407
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,402
<i>Except he's a bit special.</i>

408
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,966
<i>We had it specially
printed in Milan.</i>

409
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,210
<i>And we told Valentino,
"You have to unroll it. "</i>

410
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,605
<i>He said, "How long is it?"
Twenty-five meters.</i>

411
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:22,124
<i>He said, "So long!" We said,
"Don't win so much! "</i>

412
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,085
<i>The most special was the first
podium when he was very small.</i>

413
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,142
<i>He's pulling away
! Victory at last for Valentino Rossi!</i>

414
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:35,164
<i>Whoa! And he almost swipes
the wall in his delight!</i>

415
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,565
That was the moment
we knew he was a real racer.

416
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,884
It is fantastic for me!
I tried to push very hard.

417
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,210
Push very hard, pushed very hard.
It was very funny. And I win.

418
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,529
Ipushed. Win the
championship with a victory.

419
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,887
I pushed very hard.
We made a very hard fight.

420
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,004
I pushed and I pushed
and I pushed. It's very good.

421
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,930
I'm the second rider in
history to arrive at 100

422
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,045
with Giacomo Agostini.

423
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:52,371
I'm so happy, but I hope
to have some other season

424
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,088
for increasing the number, and
for a fight with the other guys.

425
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,326
Thanks a lot to everybody.

426
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,048
<i>All his races
are beautiful.</i>

427
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,604
<i>Especially Welkom
when he beat Biaggi.</i>

428
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:09,089
The first year that
he rode the Yamaha

429
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,081
<i>which Biaggi
said was no good.</i>

430
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,566
<i>In 2003, Rossi's archrival,
Max Biaggi, left Yamaha for Honda,</i>

431
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,444
<i>saying that the Yamaha
was no good</i>

432
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,928
<i>and that he needed a Honda
like Rossi's to win.</i>

433
00:30:23,963 --> 00:30:25,922
<i>Rossi was invincible
on the Honda,</i>

434
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,771
<i>taking three world
championships in a row.</i>

435
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,250
<i>In 2003, he and the other Honda
riders won 15 of the 16 races.</i>

436
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,724
<i>Loris Capirossi won
the 16th on a Ducati.</i>

437
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,650
<i>Biaggi had a point.</i>

438
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,405
<i>Honda was the
most competitive bike.</i>

439
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,885
<i>It was the team where
everybody wanted to be.</i>

440
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:49,767
And, we as Yamaha, especially during
2003, we had a very difficult time.

441
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,963
<i>I started to
manage the MotoGP in 2003.</i>

442
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,943
But our bike and our organization,
everything's very bad.

443
00:30:57,978 --> 00:31:02,767
As a factory team, we didn't
achieve one single podium.

444
00:31:02,802 --> 00:31:06,003
So we've never been
a top three in any race.

445
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,125
So it was a very tough
year, even more tough

446
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,006
<i>was trying to convince Valentino
to join that manufacturer.</i>

447
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:17,528
I am here to say
thank you very much to Honda

448
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,203
and to say also,
unfortunately,

449
00:31:20,238 --> 00:31:22,806
next year we don't
race together.

450
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,445
<i>A fantastic period for me,
three world championships.</i>

451
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,530
Maybe making this choice at this
point is a little bit crazy.

452
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,363
I thought it was a joke.

453
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,846
<i>But he had some trouble with
the previous manufacturer.</i>

454
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,169
<i>Rossi was winning
world championships</i>

455
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,647
<i>and earning tens of millions
of dollars at Honda.</i>

456
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,004
<i>But he felt like a prisoner,
the prisoner of a company</i>

457
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,765
<i>which held the bike to be
more important than the rider.</i>

458
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,162
<i>The prisoner of PR obligations
and corporate orders.</i>

459
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,044
<i>With the Honda, he knew
he could always win.</i>

460
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,044
<i>But he said, "I'm winning,
but I'm not having fun.</i>

461
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,045
<i>"I prefer to have fun
than win again."</i>

462
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,645
That's important.

463
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,531
<i>Not many people
will leave a sure thing</i>

464
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,490
<i>for something uncertain,
like the Yamaha.</i>

465
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,561
<i>Yamaha offered Rossi
what he wanted, freedom.</i>

466
00:32:18,596 --> 00:32:20,767
<i>All he had to do was show
up and ride the bike</i>

467
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,081
<i>with the added incentive
that everybody knew</i>

468
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,931
<i>that the Yamaha was
an inferior machine.</i>

469
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,727
<i>Everybody
was saying that</i>

470
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,884
<i>he was winning just because
he had the best bike.</i>

471
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,248
Easy to win with that bike,
and he didn't like that.

472
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,362
<i>So, he wanted
to challenge that.</i>

473
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,370
Valentino wanted to show
the reasons of him winning

474
00:32:40,405 --> 00:32:42,761
is himself, not the bike.

475
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,408
<i>So he came to me and
talked about that story.</i>

476
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,005
So, I was really hungry
to get the win.

477
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,886
So that was a good time to talk to
each other, to make a good bike.

478
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,288
<i>In Masao Furusawa,
Rossi had the engineering genius</i>

479
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,681
<i>he needed to redesign
the Yamaha.</i>

480
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,583
<i>Now, he just needed
the mechanical genius</i>

481
00:33:02,618 --> 00:33:04,565
<i>to optimize the bike
for each race,</i>

482
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,570
<i>his crew chief at Honda,
Jeremy Burgess,</i>

483
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,924
<i>the only man in MotoGP with more
world titles to his name than Rossi.</i>

484
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,445
You're always trying to give
him the best bike for the job.

485
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,962
The motorcycle is a tool
to assist an individual

486
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,450
<i>to do what he loves to do.</i>

487
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,650
<i>My job is, essentially, to sharpen
the tool so he can do it.</i>

488
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,285
<i>The Australian
prepared the bikes</i>

489
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,925
<i>for Wayne Gardner
and Mick Doohan,</i>

490
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,806
<i>taking six world titles with
them, and then three with Rossi.</i>

491
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,445
<i>But always with Honda.</i>

492
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,086
My team say, at the beginning,
"You are fucking crazy

493
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,607
"to go with Yamaha!
We'll remain with Honda.

494
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,927
"It's a lot
more easy."

495
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,440
<i>You only meet one
Valentino Rossi in your life.</i>

496
00:33:43,475 --> 00:33:45,801
<i>We could be racing
lawn mowers, you know?</i>

497
00:33:45,836 --> 00:33:48,925
<i>I do it because
I love to win,</i>

498
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,805
<i>and he's the guy
we can win with.</i>

499
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,605
<i>Honda held Rossi
to his contract to the end</i>

500
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,362
<i>so that he couldn't test the Yamaha
at all until the year was out,</i>

501
00:33:58,397 --> 00:34:02,085
<i>putting his new team at a further
disadvantage going into 2004.</i>

502
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,481
Nobody expected us to do
any good the first year,

503
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,523
particularly the first race.
Realistically, you think,

504
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:08,646
<i>nobody could win
on that bike.</i>

505
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,204
<i>Biaggi just holds firm.
Rossi very, very close indeed.</i>

506
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,605
<i>Biaggi runs it wide an inch,
Rossi will be through.</i>

507
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,644
<i>But there's no way through at the
moment for the Yamaha rider.</i>

508
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,645
<i>Time's up,
Rossi goes through.</i>

509
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,648
<i>There was an inch,
and Rossi's done it.</i>

510
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,524
<i>And there's nothing
Biaggi can do about it.</i>

511
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:26,285
<i>They brake for
the left-hander!</i>

512
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,209
<i>Rossi's just a little
bit out of shape,</i>

513
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,605
<i>but somehow he hangs
on to the Yamaha.</i>

514
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,007
I mean, Valentino put in an
extra effort to win that race.

515
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,325
<i>Rossi's gonna do it!</i>

516
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,887
<i>Valentino Rossi wins
the African Grand Prix</i>

517
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,002
<i>from Max Biaggi!</i>

518
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,569
<i>There was a lot of
emotion in that first weekend</i>

519
00:34:47,604 --> 00:34:48,805
<i>for him to win on that bike.</i>

520
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,127
<i>Trust me, it wasn't a given.</i>

521
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,890
<i>That victory
cemented the Rossi legend.</i>

522
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,965
<i>No one had ever
done this before,</i>

523
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,731
<i>win the last race of the year
for one manufacturer,</i>

524
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,049
<i>and the first race of the
next season for another.</i>

525
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,369
<i>It also buried Biaggi
as a serious challenger.</i>

526
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,244
<i>He won only
one more Grand Prix</i>

527
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,762
<i>and was left without a MotoGP
ride at the end of 2005.</i>

528
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:26,210
I have the 2004 bike of Welkom,
the real one, in my bathroom?

529
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,682
Bedroom! Bedroom, sorry!

530
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,405
It's in the bedroom.

531
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,727
No, it's not in the toilet.
It's in the bedroom.

532
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,405
<i>Every morning, when I
wake up, I see my bike,</i>

533
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,409
<i>and I have some socks
sometimes on the bike,</i>

534
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,761
<i>but anyways,
it's a great memory.</i>

535
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,561
<i>He's a charmer,
you know? He's star material,</i>

536
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,762
whatever sport
he'd be in.

537
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,243
But apart from that,
he's a ruthless killer.

538
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:56,606
I always feel people
need reminding of that.

539
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,063
<i>He really is a savage
competitor,</i>

540
00:35:59,098 --> 00:36:01,407
<i>not in a way of
being dangerous,</i>

541
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,287
<i>but of being very dedicated to
winning, at almost any cost.</i>

542
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,802
<i>Sete Gibernau leads.
Look at the crowd!</i>

543
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,130
<i>One hundred twenty-seven thousand
Spaniards go absolutely crazy.</i>

544
00:36:13,165 --> 00:36:15,646
<i>Into the right-hander!
Rossi's got the inside.</i>

545
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,605
<i>Rossi's back in front,
he runs it wide.</i>

546
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,769
<i>Now, who has the first position for
the right-hander? It's Gibernau.</i>

547
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,286
<i>Rossi's surely gonna try and
get up the inside of Gibernau.</i>

548
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,125
<i>Gibernau holds
the pole position.</i>

549
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,640
<i>They brake for the left-hander.
Rossi up the inside!</i>

550
00:36:28,675 --> 00:36:30,125
<i>They touch!
Oh, they touched.</i>

551
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,288
<i>Rossi. Gibernau's
running wide.</i>

552
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,607
<i>Rossi's punted him
off the track!</i>

553
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,340
<i>Rossi's gonna take victory
in the Spanish Grand Prix!</i>

554
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:39,961
<i>Gibernau's in the gravel.
Can he get back on the track</i>

555
00:36:39,996 --> 00:36:41,565
<i>in time to take second?</i>

556
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,126
<i>Do they get any
better than that?</i>

557
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,686
That was a strong move.
Yeah.

558
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,642
That was a Simoncelli move.

559
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,521
<i>We're just seeing it again,
the replay here, and I don't know,</i>

560
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,605
<i>Rossi is very, very deep.
As you say, his foot came off.</i>

561
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,689
<i>You can see the contact here
better than anywhere else, but...</i>

562
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,962
<i>It was the
last corner, you know?</i>

563
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,683
You have to try.

564
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,805
<i>The Spanish crowd here,</i>

565
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,320
<i>the whole stand in front
of me are singing fuera,</i>

566
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,205
<i>which means "out. " They want
Rossi banned from this race.</i>

567
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,329
<i>It's thumbs down all the way
in front of me here.</i>

568
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,681
<i>They're whistling and
booing Valentino Rossi.</i>

569
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,330
<i>What a start
to the season!</i>

570
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,365
<i>If you're a racer, actually, all
that matters is winning, isn't it?</i>

571
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,369
<i>What he's here
to do is win.</i>

572
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,165
<i>Look at the way
he destroyed Max Biaggi.</i>

573
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,328
<i>He destroyed
Sete Gibernau.</i>

574
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,845
<i>This is motorcycle,</i>

575
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,406
<i>and it's very good that
you have a hard fight,</i>

576
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,366
like, in my case,
with Biaggi, with Gibernau,

577
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,006
and especially, at the end,
with Stoner in Laguna Seca.

578
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,730
<i>Rossi and Gibernau
had been feuding for a while.</i>

579
00:37:48,765 --> 00:37:50,205
<i>In 2004,</i>

580
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,881
<i>Rossi vowed that the Spaniard
would never win another race.</i>

581
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,685
<i>Gibernau never did.</i>

582
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,326
<i>He left the sport
for good in 2009.</i>

583
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,081
<i>Casey Stoner
is a different story.</i>

584
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,160
<i>He beat Rossi fair
and square in 2007,</i>

585
00:38:05,195 --> 00:38:07,761
<i>winning 10 races
to Rossi's four.</i>

586
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,086
<i>This was the first year of the
new 800cc MotoGP formula,</i>

587
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,205
<i>Stoner's first year on the Ducati,
and only his second in MotoGP.</i>

588
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,208
<i>The Australian on the Italian
bike took everybody by surprise,</i>

589
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,408
<i>including himself.</i>

590
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,045
Qatar, there's
no way we thought

591
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,405
we were gonna win
the world championship,

592
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,443
<i>but we went out there
and we won the first race,</i>

593
00:38:28,478 --> 00:38:30,447
<i>we won the third race,
we won the fourth race.</i>

594
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,449
<i>Epic battle at the front.</i>

595
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,882
<i>Stoner tries it in the
right-hander, through turn three.</i>

596
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,089
<i>A long radius, right-hander.
And Stoner's through.</i>

597
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,921
<i>Till now, I think,
the Stoner of two years ago</i>

598
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,883
<i>has been the fastest
Valentino met,</i>

599
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,082
because it was so difficult to
understand why Stoner was so fast.

600
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,610
<i>Stoner leads the way!</i>

601
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,643
<i>Rossi's gonna try to
get back to the front.</i>

602
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,922
<i>Rossi back in front, but
he runs a little bit wide.</i>

603
00:38:58,957 --> 00:39:01,085
<i>I think so,
Stoner goes back in front.</i>

604
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,645
I think it wasn't till
maybe race eight or nine

605
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,966
that we were
starting to go,

606
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,864
"Okay, we've actually got a
shot at the championship here."

607
00:39:06,899 --> 00:39:09,648
<i>Casey Stoner wins
the Grand Prix at Catalunyal</i>

608
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,245
<i>What a race!</i>

609
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,807
<i>On top of that, Stoner's
world championship on the Ducati</i>

610
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,481
<i>was the first time in over 30 years
that a European manufacturer</i>

611
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,524
<i>had beaten the Japanese
in the premier class.</i>

612
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,245
<i>Stoner
has a great talent,</i>

613
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,245
<i>and sometimes it's
impressive how fast he is.</i>

614
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,762
In three laps, he made
the lap record, as you say.

615
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,002
<i>Impressive, but if you work step by
step, it's possible to fight with him.</i>

616
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,682
<i>Nine races
into the 2008 season,</i>

617
00:39:39,717 --> 00:39:41,924
<i>Rossi was leading
the championship.</i>

618
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,642
<i>But Stoner was on a winning
streak and closing in fast.</i>

619
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:48,689
<i>At Laguna Seca,
where he triumphed in 2007</i>

620
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,605
<i>and where Ross:
had never won,</i>

621
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,645
<i>the Australian was
fastest in practice</i>

622
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,967
<i>and starting the race
from pole position.</i>

623
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,690
<i>He looked unbeatable.</i>

624
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,361
In Laguna, at that point, Casey had
won three races in succession,

625
00:40:00,396 --> 00:40:02,488
<i>and we had to stop that run,
and it looked like</i>

626
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,011
<i>he was going to win
another one,</i>

627
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,285
<i>and this is what
Casey thought.</i>

628
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,529
<i>Clearly, that was the thing that we
had to attack, was Casey's belief</i>

629
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,007
that it was a foregone conclusion
he would win the race.

630
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:15,846
Casey started for
that race sure to win,

631
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,645
<i>because he had more than
half-a-second-per-lap advantage.</i>

632
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,844
<i>But when he discovered that he'd
have to battle with me so hard,</i>

633
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,325
he didn't expect it, you know?
So, this was important.

634
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,365
<i>A lot of things weren't
shown during that race, on camera,</i>

635
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,562
<i>that happened over the
back part of the circuit.</i>

636
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,365
<i>Rossi knew he didn't have
the speed to stay with Stoner.</i>

637
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,369
<i>So he had to try and get
in front of him early</i>

638
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,689
<i>and counter attack at once
if Stoner got back past.</i>

639
00:40:41,724 --> 00:40:43,728
<i>If Stoner broke away,
he'd be gone.</i>

640
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,524
<i>Stoner was
unbelievable in Laguna,</i>

641
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,325
<i>and I knew that I had
to stay in front.</i>

642
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,409
<i>In his desperation
to stay ahead, Rossi overshot,</i>

643
00:40:53,444 --> 00:40:55,880
<i>dropping into the 10-story
downhill chicane</i>

644
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,002
<i>known as the "Corkscrew."</i>

645
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,205
<i>And the Corkscrew
incident was nothing.</i>

646
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,083
<i>That was Valentino
making a huge mistake,</i>

647
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,885
<i>running wide,
going off the track,</i>

648
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,325
<i>holding it wide open
and getting lucky</i>

649
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,601
<i>that he didn't fling himself
into one of the barriers</i>

650
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,210
<i>and into me.</i>

651
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,885
<i>From the bike,
it was quite scary.</i>

652
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,885
<i>During the practice,
I did the same mistake.</i>

653
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,244
<i>And I know that it don't have
deep sand, but just some dirt.</i>

654
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,408
<i>So when I drove over
there in the racetrack,</i>

655
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,365
<i>I say, "Maybe it's okay,
because I already</i>

656
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,085
<i>"try one time in the practice.
But I don't want to try it. "</i>

657
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,565
<i>Just made a mistake,
you know?</i>

658
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,725
There's been
some moments

659
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,764
when Valentino rides really
hard and aggressive.

660
00:41:35,799 --> 00:41:37,171
But he's as clean
as a whistle.

661
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,321
He doesn't do
anything wrong.

662
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,401
And then there's
other moments where

663
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,926
<i>he seems to leave his
brain somewhere else,</i>

664
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,082
<i>and he'll just plant it
into the side of someone</i>

665
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,565
<i>I just don't think it's correct.
It's not a contact sport.</i>

666
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,604
<i>But Stoner complained
with me, but I never touched Stoner.</i>

667
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,686
<i>So, you know, what happened
in Laguna was a great battle.</i>

668
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,367
<i>And unfortunately, when you
lose this great battle...</i>

669
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,602
It means,
"You're very angry."

670
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,121
<i>Stoner complained,
but in general,</i>

671
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,363
<i>he don't know why he complained
because I never touched him.</i>

672
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,201
<i>Yeah, there's the saying,
"What goes around, comes around."</i>

673
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,123
<i>So, you know,
we'll see what happens.</i>

674
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,282
<i>If people keep getting away
with what they are these days,</i>

675
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,404
<i>then it's gonna get quite extreme.
Something's gonna go wrong.</i>

676
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,487
<i>Stoner's 2008 challenge
faltered after Laguna.</i>

677
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,289
<i>He crashed out of
the next two races</i>

678
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,721
<i>when he was leading
from Rossi.</i>

679
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,329
<i>I think Stoner...</i>

680
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,962
<i>The thing you have to question
is his mental strength.</i>

681
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,201
<i>Rossi went on
to win the championship,</i>

682
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,605
<i>becoming only the second
rider in history</i>

683
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:49,061
<i>to regain the crown after
losing it two years in a row.</i>

684
00:42:49,096 --> 00:42:52,482
<i>The only other man to do
this, Giacomo Agostini.</i>

685
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,004
<i>Stoner's fortunes, meanwhile,
took a strange turn.</i>

686
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,682
<i>After winning 10 races in
2007, he won six in 2008,</i>

687
00:43:02,717 --> 00:43:05,081
<i>and then in 2009,
just four.</i>

688
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:10,482
<i>At Catalunya, in 2009, the day of
Rossi's last corner pass on Lorenzo,</i>

689
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,002
<i>something was
clearly wrong.</i>

690
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,522
<i>You saw him in the
paddock and went, "My God!</i>

691
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,085
<i>"You actually
should be in hospital.</i>

692
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,485
<i>"You look that pale,
that drawn. "</i>

693
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,524
<i>And it was getting to him.
He couldn't talk to anybody,</i>

694
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,849
<i>you know, one autograph
hunter would freak him out.</i>

695
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,842
<i>Then Stoner did what tough
guy racers aren't supposed to do.</i>

696
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,685
<i>In the middle of the season,
he packed up and went home.</i>

697
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,371
<i>It's better for me to pull
out and try and fix the problem.</i>

698
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,602
And then, it took us a long
time to figure it out.

699
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,890
<i>The reaction of the other
riders to that was very interesting.</i>

700
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,365
<i>They're absolutely
flabbergasted,</i>

701
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,731
<i>that he should
stop in the middle.</i>

702
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,887
<i>You just don't do that.</i>

703
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,006
How do you have the mindset
that allows you to do that?

704
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,724
<i>Casey came back
very strong,</i>

705
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,724
<i>but the question mark
is always gonna be there.</i>

706
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,810
<i>The Casey we got back,
completely different person.</i>

707
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,646
<i>Stoner was finally
diagnosed with lactose intolerance.</i>

708
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,961
<i>With the lactose intolerance,
I was getting that tired,</i>

709
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,088
<i>and that worn out on the
bike after five laps</i>

710
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,361
<i>that I was struggling to go
in on the braking points.</i>

711
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,320
<i>I wasn't able to get out
of the way of someone</i>

712
00:44:11,355 --> 00:44:13,244
<i>if I was caught in the
middle of a few riders,</i>

713
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,924
<i>and it might've been
a tricky situation.</i>

714
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,201
I'm 100% now.

715
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,090
<i>He's puzzling, you know.</i>

716
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,767
<i>I'd say he's very much always
a championship contender.</i>

717
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,007
<i>But then he does these puzzling
things, like go off for three months</i>

718
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,687
<i>or ride like a hot-headed
Moto2 maniac, you know?</i>

719
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,607
<i>He puzzled everyone
some more by coming back</i>

720
00:44:33,642 --> 00:44:36,251
<i>and winning his home
Grand Prix in Australia</i>

721
00:44:36,286 --> 00:44:38,163
<i>and the next race
in Malaysia,</i>

722
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,131
<i>before crashing out of the last
race of 2009 on the warm-up lap.</i>

723
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,129
<i>He crashed out of the first
race of 2010 while leading,</i>

724
00:44:46,164 --> 00:44:48,122
<i>and he crashed out
at Le Mans.</i>

725
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,851
<i>I wanna try and win, and
people will criticize me for that,</i>

726
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,366
<i>but racing isn't always
about the championships.</i>

727
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,124
<i>It's a bonus at
the end of the season.</i>

728
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,765
<i>I'm out there and I'm
out there to win races,</i>

729
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,769
get the best result
I possibly can in each race.

730
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,180
<i>Of course, sometimes
the mistakes come.</i>

731
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,763
<i>Unlike Stoner and Lorenzo, Valentino
Rossi has never missed a Grand Prix.</i>

732
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:10,605
<i>He's done every single
race since March, 1996.</i>

733
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,122
That was 15 years ago, and
he's not yet missed a race.

734
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,805
<i>I was very close sometimes.</i>

735
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,329
<i>Valencia 2007, I had injury,
but always try to resist.</i>

736
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,804
<i>This is like a legend,
that I have never have pain,</i>

737
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,571
<i>but I broke a lot of things
like the other riders.</i>

738
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,120
<i>Hands, fingers, ankles.</i>

739
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:34,324
<i>One of the worst of my career
and the big, big pain...</i>

740
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,405
<i>And I remember the feeling of
pain everywhere in the body,</i>

741
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,929
<i>because I did the change of
direction before the last chicane,</i>

742
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,007
<i>and that is sixth gear,
it's 265 kilometers per hour,</i>

743
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,684
<i>and when I
changed direction,</i>

744
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,167
<i>and I hold the bike
on the left of the tire,</i>

745
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,841
<i>the tires start and make
a very bad high side.</i>

746
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,163
<i>And I have the time,
when I fly, to say,</i>

747
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,169
"Mamma mia, what's happened?
Now is a big, big crash!"

748
00:46:04,204 --> 00:46:07,528
And when I go down and
start tumble afterwards,

749
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:11,361
<i>it's like 30 people kick you,
you know, all together.</i>

750
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,201
<i>And broke the hand,
it was a very bad crash,</i>

751
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,203
<i>and a very stupid
mistake from myself,</i>

752
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,846
<i>because I needed
to wait more.</i>

753
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,922
<i>There are far fewer serious
injuries than 10 or 20 years ago.</i>

754
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:30,644
The injuries now are usually to
the extremities of the skeleton,

755
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,041
<i>the bones of the hand,</i>

756
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,963
<i>the feet, the shoulder</i>

757
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:41,002
<i>and especially
the collarbone.</i>

758
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,207
<i>Rossi raced two days later
with broken bones in his hand and wrist,</i>

759
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,044
<i>and finished eighth.</i>

760
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,806
<i>2006 was the year things
started going wrong for him.</i>

761
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,365
<i>After five consecutive
MotoGP world titles,</i>

762
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,483
<i>Rossi was the clear favorite
to win the championship.</i>

763
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,885
<i>Then Toni Elias knocks him
off in the first race,</i>

764
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,561
<i>and tire and mechanical failures put
him out of another three Grand Prixs.</i>

765
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,846
<i>Valentino Rossi,
seven and a half laps to go,</i>

766
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,763
<i>is out of the
French Grand Prix.</i>

767
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,400
<i>Midway through the season,
when he crashed and broke his hand</i>

768
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,244
<i>in practice,
for the Dutch Grand Prix,</i>

769
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,887
<i>he was trailing the American
Nicky Hayden by 43 points.</i>

770
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,446
<i>Rossi fought back in the
second half of the season,</i>

771
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,565
<i>and was just 18 points
behind the American</i>

772
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,444
<i>going into the penultimate
race in Portugal.</i>

773
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,086
<i>He came out of that weekend
with an eight-point lead,</i>

774
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,124
<i>after Hayden's own teammate,
Dani Pedrosa, knocked him off.</i>

775
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,763
<i>I thought it was over, man.</i>

776
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,123
<i>I thought it was 25 years
of hard work out the window,</i>

777
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,244
and my dream of being
world champion was done.

778
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,925
<i>I've never felt pain
like that in my life.</i>

779
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:53,444
<i>It came in a bad moment,
especially for him, but it was racing.</i>

780
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,367
<i>It never happened before to me,
and it never happened again.</i>

781
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,205
But it came
right finally so...

782
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,487
<i>We were in the
motor home after I crashed,</i>

783
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,483
<i>and we were watching
the race, and I was like,</i>

784
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,809
<i>"Oh, my God, Toni's about to
nip him at the line here."</i>

785
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,684
<i>And that just gave me
a feeling that,</i>

786
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:12,525
<i>"You know what,
this ain't over. "</i>

787
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,331
<i>That's five points, that
adds a whole new dimension.</i>

788
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,643
<i>I never pulled for a guy
so hard in my life.</i>

789
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:27,011
<i>The final twist came at Valencia,
where Rossi did what nobody expected.</i>

790
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,650
<i>He crashed.</i>

791
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:34,330
<i>The worst moment of my career,
except when you crash and you have pain.</i>

792
00:48:34,365 --> 00:48:37,324
<i>I was very, very fast and
I did the pole position,</i>

793
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:38,481
<i>but at the same time,</i>

794
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,690
<i>I had an impressive race
pace with the race tires.</i>

795
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,286
<i>Pam! Pam! Pam!
Very fast, the bike was okay.</i>

796
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,781
Sunday, nothing worked. I didn't
have the same grip from the tires.

797
00:48:49,816 --> 00:48:53,082
<i>Rossi looked like
he bogged it, a bit off the line.</i>

798
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,485
<i>He's back in the field
there a bit.</i>

799
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,286
And when I start for the race,
the bike was impossible to ride.

800
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,645
<i>Hayden up
the inside of Capirossi.</i>

801
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,967
<i>Hayden now
up into third place.</i>

802
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,964
<i>And there is Valentino Ross! just get
a glimpse of that yellow helmet-</i>

803
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,281
<i>He's not where
he wants to be.</i>

804
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,887
<i>For me, something
strange happened with the tire.</i>

805
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,890
<i>The tires were not
the same of Saturday,</i>

806
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,201
I think,
but you never know.

807
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,047
<i>Valentino Rossi is gonna
have to produce the ride of his life</i>

808
00:49:21,082 --> 00:49:23,361
<i>if he is gonna
win the 2006...</i>

809
00:49:23,396 --> 00:49:24,646
<i>Oh! Rossi's gone down!</i>

810
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,881
<i>Rossi's down,
Rossi is down.</i>

811
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,010
The reality is I lose the
championship and Nicky win.

812
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,564
<i>Hayden finished third
and won the world championship,</i>

813
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,967
<i>proving that absolutely
anything can happen,</i>

814
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,486
<i>even after you get taken
out by your teammate</i>

815
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,562
<i>and you're eight points
behind Valentino Rossi</i>

816
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,484
<i>going into the final race.</i>

817
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,484
<i>Rossi lost the championship
by five points,</i>

818
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,086
<i>the difference between
first and second in Portugal,</i>

819
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,531
<i>where Toni Elias beat him.</i>

820
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,561
<i>Toni Elias,</i>

821
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,923
<i>the man who knocked him off in
Jerez at the start of the season.</i>

822
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,244
Toni, my boy Toni, did me
the biggest favor ever.

823
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,931
I mean, I always have a soft
spot in my heart for that guy.

824
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,281
<i>How dangerous is MotoGP?</i>

825
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,964
<i>And where exactly
is the danger?</i>

826
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,961
<i>Rossi's crashes offer two answers.
A machine problem,</i>

827
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,811
<i>the Valencia crash was due
to an electronic fault,</i>

828
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,245
<i>and the most common
cause, human error.</i>

829
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,044
<i>In Holland, Rossi had
not waited long enough</i>

830
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,646
<i>for the rear tire to get up
to optimum temperature.</i>

831
00:50:52,681 --> 00:50:54,802
<i>So it lacked grip.</i>

832
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,963
<i>They may resemble superheroes
in their high-tech race suits,</i>

833
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,442
<i>but the riders are
human and breakable.</i>

834
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,440
Motorsport is supposed
to be dangerous,

835
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:10,931
<i>but not too dangerous. It's a
bit of a tightrope, really.</i>

836
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,083
<i>And you'd have to say that
the improvement in safety</i>

837
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,640
<i>over the last 20 years
of motorbike racing</i>

838
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,127
<i>has been
absolutely fantastic.</i>

839
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,004
<i>When riders crash nowadays,</i>

840
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,407
<i>serious injury is less
likely than it used to be</i>

841
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,767
<i>because of the improvements
in track safety</i>

842
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,485
<i>with huge runoff areas,</i>

843
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,841
<i>and the protective
equipment the riders wear,</i>

844
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,525
<i>which now includes
crash-activated airbags,</i>

845
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,091
<i>as well as body armor
beneath the leather.</i>

846
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,764
<i>In recent years, some
riders have crashed</i>

847
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,686
<i>20 or 30 times in a season
without serious injury.</i>

848
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,364
<i>Carlos held the record for
the most crashes in one season,</i>

849
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,203
<i>like 28 crashes
or something.</i>

850
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,282
Exactly, I don't know,
but it was around 30.

851
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,328
<i>I stopped counting.</i>

852
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,885
<i>They fall a lot
at the beginning.</i>

853
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,005
When they're on small bikes,
they fall a lot.

854
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:19,046
Then they stabilize, and when they're
older, they start to fall again.

855
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,810
<i>The champions
fall very rarely, though.</i>

856
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,929
<i>Even 30 years ago, when the
tracks were not at all safe</i>

857
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,968
<i>and there were
far more fatalities,</i>

858
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,084
<i>the best riders
rarely died on the track.</i>

859
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,881
<i>All the premier class champions,
from 1960 to the present day,</i>

860
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,964
<i>survived their
motorcycle racing careers.</i>

861
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,523
<i>Making very few mistakes is one of the
defining qualities of a champion.</i>

862
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,728
<i>In two of his
championship-winning years,</i>

863
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,202
<i>Rossi finished every single
race, and in the others,</i>

864
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:51,045
<i>he never crashed out
more than twice.</i>

865
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,285
<i>To be
a successful racer,</i>

866
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,761
<i>you have to have a strong
sense of self-preservation</i>

867
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:00,607
<i>and an overweening confidence
in your own ability.</i>

868
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:06,161
<i>They are human men,
but humans of a rare type,</i>

869
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,605
<i>something like
fighter pilots</i>

870
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,490
<i>with their extraordinary
hand-eye coordination,</i>

871
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,528
<i>their cool heads
in a fight,</i>

872
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:16,207
<i>the combination of extreme
discipline in training and testing,</i>

873
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,365
<i>and the willingness to risk it
all when the moment demands it.</i>

874
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,249
<i>But no matter
how good you are,</i>

875
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:26,120
<i>and no matter how great the
improvements to tracks and equipment,</i>

876
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,521
<i>things can still
go badly wrong.</i>

877
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,327
<i>With solo crashes,
you might break a hand,</i>

878
00:53:34,362 --> 00:53:37,563
but serious injuries
are very rare.

879
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:41,531
When they're in a group, and there is a
faller, the others can run him over.

880
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,804
<i>That's the biggest danger.</i>

881
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,091
<i>Catalunya, 2006, lap one,</i>

882
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,409
<i>heading into Turn 1
at over 150 miles an hour.</i>

883
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,041
<i>Sete Gibernau clips the back
of Loris Capirossi's Ducati.</i>

884
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,081
<i>I was right
behind Sete when it happened.</i>

885
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,571
<i>He started braking, and he was
braking on the white line</i>

886
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,610
<i>that separated the track
from the pit lane entrance.</i>

887
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,882
<i>And I think that kind of
spooked him a little bit,</i>

888
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,610
<i>and he tried to get
off the white line.</i>

889
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,603
<i>As he tried to do that,
he just</i>

890
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,964
<i>ventured over into Capirossi, and
hit his front brake and then</i>

891
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,725
<i>it was assholes
and elbows after that.</i>

892
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,928
<i>Once all the
carnage started,</i>

893
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,490
<i>I just remember
seeing Melandri</i>

894
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,211
<i>stuck up the back
of somebody's rear wheel,</i>

895
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,727
<i>basically trying
to rip his arm off.</i>

896
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,486
<i>When I came in,
I'm pretty sure I was</i>

897
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,881
<i>a couple of shades whiter than
what I am right now because</i>

898
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,847
I thought I'd just watched Melandri
get completely offed.

899
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,843
He was fine, you know.

900
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,730
<i>But it was a pretty
gnarly crash for sure.</i>

901
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,528
<i>At Assen in 2008,</i>

902
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:55,725
<i>John Hopkins crashed in the same
corner as Rossi two years earlier,</i>

903
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,529
<i>but this was
a machine failure.</i>

904
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,285
<i>It sent him off the track
at an unexpected angle,</i>

905
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,164
<i>straight into the wall.</i>

906
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,641
<i>It was such an
odd place where I had crashed</i>

907
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,768
<i>because it was a bike
mechanical failure,</i>

908
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,162
<i>and one of the forks actually didn't
compress when I went in to brake,</i>

909
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:15,041
<i>so that the front just slid and I
went off in fifth gear, wide open,</i>

910
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,010
<i>and the data said that, at top
speed, right when I crashed,</i>

911
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,208
<i>I was doing
168 miles an hour.</i>

912
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,601
<i>So I hit the wall at over
100 miles an hour.</i>

913
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,843
<i>That's like falling from an airplane
and just hitting the concrete.</i>

914
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,366
<i>Thank God I hit it
with my feet first.</i>

915
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,966
<i>I blew out my knee and
busted my ankle and stuff,</i>

916
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,929
but had I been headfirst,
I would have broken my neck

917
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,365
and would've been
dead for sure.

918
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,124
<i>That definitely frightened me, man.
That scared me a lot.</i>

919
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,689
<i>John Hopkins was lucky.</i>

920
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,606
<i>Daijiro Kato, who died
in a freak accident</i>

921
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:48,526
<i>at the Japanese Grand Prix
in 2003, was unlucky.</i>

922
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,808
<i>Shoya Tomizawa, an emerging
star in the new Moto2 category,</i>

923
00:55:55,843 --> 00:55:57,450
<i>will be unlucky.</i>

924
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,209
<i>In September, 2010,</i>

925
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:03,648
<i>five months after winning
his first Grand Prix in Qatar,</i>

926
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,609
<i>he will lose his life
in a freak accident</i>

927
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,489
<i>at the San Marino race,</i>

928
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:11,610
<i>struck by two other bikes after he
fell directly in front of them.</i>

929
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,650
It's that kind of reality
that you don't want to see,

930
00:56:17,685 --> 00:56:21,201
because you don't think
it will happen to you.

931
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:26,730
It's something, you know it's
there, but it's better not to look.

932
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,210
<i>Mugello
belongs to Valentino Rossi.</i>

933
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,363
<i>He's won nine Grand Prixs
in all classes here,</i>

934
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,205
<i>including seven consecutively
in the premier class.</i>

935
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,804
<i>It's a special
place for him,</i>

936
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,009
<i>and he always brings
something special to wear.</i>

937
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,843
<i>Mugello is the classic
special helmet of the year.</i>

938
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,610
Many times,

939
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,251
he was able to do the best
with the special helmets.

940
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:57,042
<i>The face was the most famous
special helmet of Valentino.</i>

941
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,566
<i>To be honest,
a few days before,</i>

942
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:03,087
<i>we have no idea about what can
be the next special helmet.</i>

943
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,128
<i>I asked him
to talk about Mugello.</i>

944
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,168
We was talking
about Casanova-Savelli,

945
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,004
you know, there is that
going down to the hill.

946
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:13,406
<i>And then he show me, when you
go down, the face you have...</i>

947
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,208
Yeah, and he makes
a special face

948
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,362
and they say,
"Do it one more time."

949
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,484
<i>He do it, I take
a picture and I said,</i>

950
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,530
<i>"Okay, that is the new
helmet for Mugello. "</i>

951
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:29,322
<i>We are working with a lot of
riders and for everyone, I think,</i>

952
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,290
<i>to have the right color
or the right cartoon</i>

953
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:35,011
<i>or something that
they have in their heart,</i>

954
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,446
<i>maybe one image,
maybe one special sign,</i>

955
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,205
<i>makes the rider
more comfortable.</i>

956
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:45,887
<i>The story of humanity is full
of these kinds of things.</i>

957
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,606
<i>The soldiers,
the cavaliers in the past,</i>

958
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,762
<i>the Indians in America,</i>

959
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,729
they take colors
with the hands

960
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,610
and put it on
the face to be strong,

961
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:00,402
<i>to be more aggressive or maybe
to take away their fear.</i>

962
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,804
<i>So, the colors, they can help
a man to be more strong.</i>

963
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,929
<i>It's like when
Superman put the suit on.</i>

964
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,210
<i>So when I put my yellow leather
suit, it's not just protection,</i>

965
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,329
<i>but also
psychological effect.</i>

966
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,850
<i>A MotoGP bike is a
machine with a human at one end</i>

967
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,161
<i>and a small patch
of rubber at the other.</i>

968
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:26,131
<i>In the middle is an engine generating
an enormous amount of power.</i>

969
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,771
<i>The job of the rider
and his team is to figure out</i>

970
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,241
<i>how to get as much of
that power to the ground</i>

971
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,805
<i>for as much of
every lap as possible.</i>

972
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:37,525
<i>The bikes are pure prototypes,
costing tens of millions of dollars</i>

973
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,285
<i>and created
exclusively for racing.</i>

974
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:45,400
<i>These are the numbers,
220 horsepower, 350 pounds,</i>

975
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,929
<i>the minimum machinery
for the maximum performance,</i>

976
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,367
<i>far more power-to-weight
than a Formula One car,</i>

977
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,646
<i>more speed, too.</i>

978
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,963
<i>Over 210 miles an hour
at tracks like Mugello,</i>

979
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,407
<i>where an F1 car
tops out at 200.</i>

980
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,008
<i>The big difference
is that, in the car racing,</i>

981
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:04,368
<i>they are able to understand all
the things from the computer,</i>

982
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,205
<i>because the driver
is stuck on the car.</i>

983
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,604
<i>In the bike, it's a lot more difficult
to understand what's happened,</i>

984
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,526
<i>because more movement of the rider
changes all the balance of the bike.</i>

985
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,927
<i>For this reason, it's more
important, the experience</i>

986
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,525
<i>and the indication
of the rider.</i>

987
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:26,451
<i>In Italian, the word for a
motorcycle racer is centauro, a centaur,</i>

988
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,649
<i>the mythical animal
that is half-man, half-horse.</i>

989
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,960
<i>But it's no myth.</i>

990
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,931
<i>A MotoGP bike is a prosthetic
limb for speed freaks.</i>

991
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:36,844
<i>The engineer's job
is to make the bike</i>

992
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,763
<i>an extension of
the rider's body,</i>

993
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,842
<i>moving in every
direction with him,</i>

994
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,491
<i>giving him the feedback
he needs to go faster.</i>

995
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,605
<i>When I was a small kid,</i>

996
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:50,127
<i>I really wanted to be
an airplane engineer.</i>

997
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,168
<i>But after World War II,</i>

998
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,404
<i>we are kind of forbidden to make
airplanes, from the United States.</i>

999
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:01,646
<i>So most of the good engineers went
to automotives or motorcycles.</i>

1000
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:05,805
<i>That's why the motorcycle
engineering is very good in Japan,</i>

1001
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,201
<i>because a motorcycle
is next to an airplane,</i>

1002
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,726
<i>much more
similar dynamics.</i>

1003
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,121
<i>So, looks like
a simple vehicle,</i>

1004
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,647
<i>but, actually, it's pretty much
complicated in the 3D moving,</i>

1005
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,167
<i>more than
the four-wheeled cars.</i>

1006
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,767
<i>A motorcycle at this
level is basically flying on the ground.</i>

1007
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,810
So, a motorcycle comes along,
pitches into a corner,

1008
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,166
it gets to 60 degrees.

1009
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,810
<i>There's two gravities
going down through the tire.</i>

1010
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,962
<i>That's exactly the same
as of any aircraft</i>

1011
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,326
<i>which goes into a corner.</i>

1012
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,011
<i>There's two gravities
trying to pull the wings off.</i>

1013
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:40,527
<i>The physics of doing 140 miles
an hour with your knee on the ground,</i>

1014
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,763
<i>everything's trying to suck
itself into the ground.</i>

1015
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,162
This weight should make the
bike fall into the corner.

1016
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,924
But, because of the speed

1017
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,771
<i>and other forces,
force that's centrifugal,</i>

1018
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:55,606
<i>that makes these two
forces in equilibrium.</i>

1019
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,366
That's why the bike can lean
and don't fall into the curve.

1020
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,171
<i>When you run
around the corner,</i>

1021
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,447
the force wants to
throw you to the outside,

1022
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,410
so you counteract it
by leaning to the inside.

1023
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,606
Same with a motorcycle.

1024
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,160
<i>Everyone who's ridden a
bicycle has that experience.</i>

1025
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,446
<i>It's not that
far away, really.</i>

1026
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,050
<i>They just go
a hell of a lot faster.</i>

1027
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,404
<i>When it's on its side,</i>

1028
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,563
<i>the entire bike must
flex to absorb the bumps,</i>

1029
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:23,326
<i>because the suspension cannot move
up and down when it's horizontal.</i>

1030
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,768
<i>The chassis has to be flexible.
It's a controlled flex.</i>

1031
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:31,084
To quote one of the Honda
Japanese, "it bends like a tree.

1032
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,171
<i>"It bends and returns
to its position."</i>

1033
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,322
<i>On Sundays,
they are gladiators.</i>

1034
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:41,087
<i>But on Fridays and Saturdays,
during practice and qualifying,</i>

1035
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,522
<i>the riders and their teams are
more like research scientists.</i>

1036
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,806
<i>Their subject?</i>

1037
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,167
<i>Bending the laws of physics
as far as possible.</i>

1038
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,645
<i>Every track
has its own attitude</i>

1039
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,330
<i>of what the bike
needs to be set at.</i>

1040
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,971
<i>The tarmac surface,
cambers, off-cambers,</i>

1041
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,929
<i>maybe some uphills,
downhills,</i>

1042
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,368
<i>tighter corners, slower
corners, faster corners.</i>

1043
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,489
<i>If you can get a bike
that works 85%, 90%, that's good.</i>

1044
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,925
<i>It's never going
to be perfect,</i>

1045
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,685
<i>because you have so many different
types of corners on a track.</i>

1046
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:08,921
<i>You're going to go through
a corner and be like,</i>

1047
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,809
<i>"Okay, it's awesome
through there."</i>

1048
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,644
<i>You get to a hairpin and
you're like, "It's a wreck. "</i>

1049
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:17,449
You gotta at least try to keep the
traction just a little bit longer

1050
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,171
till we can start driving,
because I can't roll with that.

1051
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,004
So, right in here,
it's still skatey

1052
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,684
when you're going
to the throttle,

1053
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,484
then it transfers,
then it grips.

1054
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:26,481
Yeah.

1055
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,846
<i>All I try
and do is make him</i>

1056
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,524
<i>as comfortable as
he can be on the bike.</i>

1057
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,610
<i>Once he's comfortable,
then he can go do his job.</i>

1058
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,604
It's doing everything
okay, but...

1059
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,728
<i>It always feels like</i>

1060
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,643
<i>there's a little something
here you could make better.</i>

1061
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,722
<i>You could make this better, get
a little more feel out of that,</i>

1062
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,245
<i>have a little more
traction here.</i>

1063
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,283
<i>There could always be something
a little bit better.</i>

1064
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,283
<i>A MotoGP bike
is so finicky.</i>

1065
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,120
<i>It sounds stupid,
but one mil here,</i>

1066
01:02:50,155 --> 01:02:52,845
<i>one mil there,
which is nothing,</i>

1067
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,042
<i>you go out and you come in
and go, "I can't ride it. "</i>

1068
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,407
<i>I mean, it's crazy.</i>

1069
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,605
I don't like.

1070
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,286
<i>Every rider
wants the same thing.</i>

1071
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,091
<i>The ability to feel
the track through the bike,</i>

1072
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,764
<i>to sense exactly
what's happening</i>

1073
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,002
<i>where the tires
touch the asphalt.</i>

1074
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:13,091
<i>With feel comes confidence,
with confidence comes speed.</i>

1075
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,561
<i>You ask anybody,</i>

1076
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,927
<i>"Do you want more front end feel
or do you want more horsepower?"</i>

1077
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,889
<i>Everybody's always gonna say,
"More front end feel. "</i>

1078
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,008
<i>Once you get a
comfortable front end,</i>

1079
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,367
<i>you start carrying more speed,
a little more entry speed,</i>

1080
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,566
<i>and then your lap
times start dropping.</i>

1081
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:29,687
<i>What matters here is that the
tire contact patch is so small,</i>

1082
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,810
<i>and you've got to put 220
horsepower through that.</i>

1083
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:37,566
<i>So, it's a game of not
over-stressing those tires,</i>

1084
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:41,690
<i>but taking them to the limit
of their ability to grip.</i>

1085
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,286
<i>But never too far.</i>

1086
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,966
<i>And it's that little bit,
that last little bit,</i>

1087
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,930
<i>that all these teams are
searching for to make them work.</i>

1088
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,665
<i>Suspension is working,
but the tire is not working,</i>

1089
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,931
<i>so we need to push on tire,
try to get tire working.</i>

1090
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:10,245
<i>Before riding, tire warmers
heat the tires to 80 degrees Celsius.</i>

1091
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:13,091
<i>Out on the track, the riders
have to work them hard</i>

1092
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,851
<i>to generate additional heat and
the grip that comes with it.</i>

1093
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,287
It is regular to go over
100 degrees Celsius.

1094
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,041
<i>You can't touch them when they
come in, put it that way.</i>

1095
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,168
<i>It's like touching a metal
kettle in your kitchen.</i>

1096
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,567
<i>And that's where that
amazing grip comes from.</i>

1097
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,085
<i>By the time you get them
up to that temperature,</i>

1098
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:29,481
<i>they become so sticky,
it's almost like glue.</i>

1099
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:33,770
<i>The bikes are infinitely adjustable.
The laptops tell the story.</i>

1100
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,444
<i>They may burn fossil fuel,</i>

1101
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,000
<i>but these are effectively
digital machines,</i>

1102
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,206
<i>their performance
pre-programmable.</i>

1103
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:44,327
<i>There's so much technology
nowadays with anti-wheelie,</i>

1104
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:49,048
anti-spin,
anti-rectum control.

1105
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:52,363
<i>I mean, they got all kinds
of shit on this thing that...</i>

1106
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:55,330
<i>You're constantly trying to
tweak this, play with that.</i>

1107
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,289
<i>This line is the gearbox.</i>

1108
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:02,203
You see second, third,
fourth, fifth and sixth.

1109
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,442
You see, the throttle
opening is the blue line.

1110
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:07,763
Then we have a lot of sensors
checking the engine performance,

1111
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,201
like lambda sensor,
temperature.

1112
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:14,001
<i>The total number, including
the mathematical channel,</i>

1113
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:17,163
<i>is around 200,
but normally we check 20.</i>

1114
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:21,246
The KISS Principle.
Keep it simple, stupid.

1115
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,562
Okay, so we go
with the first bike.

1116
01:05:23,597 --> 01:05:24,561
Yes.

1117
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,766
Parallel up.
Yeah.

1118
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,729
And the second bike,
bring that home.

1119
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,371
<i>Working
with him is amazing.</i>

1120
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,683
<i>If you work with him, you can
realize how amazing he is.</i>

1121
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,569
<i>Sometimes,
Valentino can make a race</i>

1122
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,847
<i>with the same lap time
from beginning to the end.</i>

1123
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:44,007
I can take the lap number four
and I overlay lap number 25.

1124
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:49,120
You can't see any difference in
speed between the lap number four

1125
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,123
<i>and the lap number 25.</i>

1126
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,362
<i>Rossi
he has that edge-</i>

1127
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,762
<i>He can feel very well,
this line.</i>

1128
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:00,606
He's going on that edge for all
the race, so he's good at that.

1129
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:06,729
<i>Mantequilla is the new
word, of this year, of my team.</i>

1130
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,804
<i>When you ride
very smooth on the turns,</i>

1131
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,245
<i>when you ride
like Mantequilla,</i>

1132
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:15,331
like you are putting
butter on bread,

1133
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,930
with the knife, very
smooth, very precise.

1134
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,320
This is the
Mantequilla style.

1135
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:28,928
<i>My dad, he was a mechanic. He was
in the garage with a hammer.</i>

1136
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:33,122
<i>So I was thinking, "When
I became a real rider,</i>

1137
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,807
<i>"I want to be at the same constant
as a hammer, with the same force,</i>

1138
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,166
<i>"and in the same time."</i>

1139
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,129
<i>Hammer, hammer,
every lap the same.</i>

1140
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:44,091
<i>This is more or less
the two best skills I have.</i>

1141
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:49,769
<i>The smooth style and the
hammer constant pace.</i>

1142
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,481
<i>The other riders are more
inconstant, apart from Valentino,</i>

1143
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:56,564
<i>who is, more or less,
the same constant as me.</i>

1144
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,683
<i>It's one
of the best points about Jorge</i>

1145
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,728
that he's not
a big technician,

1146
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,644
but he knows exactly what
he needs to be fast.

1147
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:08,209
<i>He says, "If you fix the braking,
I will be three times faster. "</i>

1148
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:11,807
<i>Always, if we are able to do
it, he is three times faster.</i>

1149
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,083
<i>Lorenzo, this year, he's
made everything look so easy.</i>

1150
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,650
<i>He looks like he could
take a hand off</i>

1151
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,240
<i>and put it behind his back
and do the same thing.</i>

1152
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:23,530
<i>Sometimes I can feel a little
bit of frustration from Valentino.</i>

1153
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,051
<i>He's developing
the machine,</i>

1154
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,009
<i>and in the meantime,
he is preparing the tool</i>

1155
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,686
<i>for his best rival
to try to beat him.</i>

1156
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,923
<i>We have the bike that we have
worked very hard on for seven years</i>

1157
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,650
<i>to make as good as it is.</i>

1158
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,200
<i>Jorge has come along and
inherited a lot of that work</i>

1159
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,049
<i>and has done
a great job with it.</i>

1160
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:44,365
<i>It's not my bike because
Vale has been doing the evolution,</i>

1161
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:48,047
<i>so he has been making
the bike for his style.</i>

1162
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,607
<i>But I adapt
my style to the bike.</i>

1163
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,804
<i>Every time I beat Valentino,
some part of the press says,</i>

1164
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,451
<i>"Why do Ramon and you make</i>

1165
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:02,330
<i>"better settings than
Vale and Burgess?"</i>

1166
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:04,811
And I say,

1167
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,724
"Maybe it's not
a question of the setting."

1168
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,729
He learned a lot
from Valentino.

1169
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,041
He's learned too much
from Valentino.

1170
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,881
<i>Valentino has
developed the bike,</i>

1171
01:08:16,916 --> 01:08:19,363
<i>and he's got
the bike ready made.</i>

1172
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,889
<i>What bothers
Rossi's fans is not just</i>

1173
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,042
<i>the fact that Lorenzo's
winning races,</i>

1174
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,481
<i>but that he's mimicking
Rossi's style.</i>

1175
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,211
<i>Rossi has the sun and moon
on his helmet and leathers,</i>

1176
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:32,011
<i>Lorenzo, a halo
and devil's horns.</i>

1177
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,321
<i>One leg of Rossi's
leathers is yellow,</i>

1178
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,721
<i>one leg of Lorenzo's, red.</i>

1179
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,086
<i>He's a copycat.</i>

1180
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:42,369
We don't like him
so much here in Tavullia.

1181
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,727
<i>How much of that
is getting up Rossi's nose?</i>

1182
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:49,249
<i>Maybe the imitation is part of
Lorenzo's way of winding Rossi up.</i>

1183
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:59,561
Valentino, nine wins here at
Mugello, seven in the MotoGP last week.

1184
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:03,003
You think of Mugello, you
think of Valentino Rossi,

1185
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,811
but it will be tough on
Sunday for many reasons,

1186
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,245
for Jorge,
in particular.

1187
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:10,767
Unfortunately, I had a bad
idea to crash with a motocross bike,

1188
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:14,322
to have an injury that
may give me some problem,

1189
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,971
but championship is long,
we need to fight.

1190
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,561
I noticed that Valentino
was very anxious at this time.

1191
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:25,611
<i>It was a difficult moment of
the season because of my shoulder injury.</i>

1192
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:27,131
<i>I need victory in Mugello.</i>

1193
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,880
<i>He had a lot of
pain to the shoulder,</i>

1194
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,008
<i>and coming to Mugello,
he said,</i>

1195
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:35,811
<i>"I am like a gambler,
I want to play the joker."</i>

1196
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,123
<i>We think of the joker
because it's like when you play cards</i>

1197
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:43,330
<i>and you have the joker, at one
moment, you have to play.</i>

1198
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:47,290
<i>And you have to play
when it's important.</i>

1199
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:02,804
<i>He'd come out on a new
tire, he'd done one out lap.</i>

1200
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,611
<i>Then he was on his second lap
and that's when you slow down.</i>

1201
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,882
<i>But he hadn't done
a complete flying lap,</i>

1202
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,724
<i>so the tire
temperature was already</i>

1203
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,371
<i>at the bottom end
of its working range.</i>

1204
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,524
<i>I slowed down because
I had Barberé following me-</i>

1205
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,570
<i>I slowed him down
for six or seven seconds.</i>

1206
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:22,928
<i>And when I started to push,
the tire on the left was cold</i>

1207
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,810
<i>and it was a big
high side, very fast.</i>

1208
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,365
<i>That was
just in front of me.</i>

1209
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:31,762
<i>So in the practice, I saw it
out of the corner of my eye.</i>

1210
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,049
<i>It was ugly because
that's a really fast place.</i>

1211
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:43,445
<i>It was a bad feeling because
I lose practice, I made a mistake.</i>

1212
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:48,128
<i>But after, when I touched
the ground, I had pain.</i>

1213
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,170
<i>I said, "Maybe the
problem is bigger."</i>

1214
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,361
<i>The violent impact
of the foot</i>

1215
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:59,331
<i>on the asphalt
broke the leg.</i>

1216
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:06,007
<i>And the broken bone pierced
the skin and became exposed.</i>

1217
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:10,520
<i>When I understood that I
broke a leg, I was quite desperate.</i>

1218
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,604
<i>The pain was hard.</i>

1219
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,482
<i>A cold tire crash
is usually the worst,</i>

1220
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,005
<i>because you just
have no idea.</i>

1221
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:22,411
<i>It's like you walked
through the front door,</i>

1222
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,209
<i>and somebody
had a baseball bat</i>

1223
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,601
<i>and just smacked you in the face
without you knowing about it.</i>

1224
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:33,046
<i>I stabilized the injury and put
the bones back in the body.</i>

1225
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,568
<i>It's not good for the bone
to be exposed to the air.</i>

1226
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,246
<i>Together with
Dr. Macchiagodena at Mugello,</i>

1227
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:42,051
<i>we arranged to get him
to the operating theater</i>

1228
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:45,442
<i>in less than three hours,
avoiding vascular complications.</i>

1229
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:51,170
<i>The day after,
me and Davide,</i>

1230
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,847
<i>we went to the hospital to
check Valentino's condition.</i>

1231
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,686
We stayed there a couple of hours.
I was quite worried about him.

1232
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:06,526
<i>Valentino will not depart
bike racing second in anything.</i>

1233
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:10,241
Valentino Rossi does not leave
this paddock on a stretcher.

1234
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:15,081
However many points he was behind
his teammate, of all people?

1235
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,766
Doesn't happen.
Won't happen.

1236
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,565
<i>Even if he just comes back and
wins one race to prove a point,</i>

1237
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,649
<i>that'll do it.</i>

1238
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,006
<i>Why did Rossi crash?</i>

1239
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:30,807
It was an unforced error,
pressure maybe, probably.

1240
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,564
<i>He's not used
to being pushed.</i>

1241
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,201
<i>And that's going to
get worse and worse.</i>

1242
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:41,682
It takes a normal person five
or six months if all goes well.

1243
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:45,164
<i>Yes, five months
is to play football.</i>

1244
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:53,246
<i>The surgery was perfect,
Dr. Buzzi did a great job</i>

1245
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:57,530
<i>and put a long pin
in the tibia.</i>

1246
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:02,809
The guy who was clever on the Sunday
morning at Mugello was Pedrosa,

1247
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,689
because he woke up
and he went,

1248
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:08,162
"I can win this.
I can step into the shoes

1249
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,686
<i>"of the man who has dominated so
many years here at Mugello. "</i>

1250
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,646
<i>He will win
the Italian Grand Prix.</i>

1251
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:15,445
<i>In the absence of
Valentino Rossi,</i>

1252
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:19,530
<i>it's not Lorenzo, but it's Dani
Pedrosa who wins at Mugello.</i>

1253
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:23,327
<i>What a ride.
Where did that come from?</i>

1254
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,242
<i>Lorenzo might not have
woken up so quickly,</i>

1255
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,164
<i>and he's now coming to the next
race here at Silverstone, going,</i>

1256
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,368
<i>"Right, I've got to be on it
and I've got to be on it now. "</i>

1257
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,846
<i>One week after the
crash, you don't think of nothing.</i>

1258
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,445
<i>You don't think
of the race and the bike.</i>

1259
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,602
<i>You just have pain,
you don't sleep,</i>

1260
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,364
<i>and you say "Fuck!"
every time.</i>

1261
01:13:41,399 --> 01:13:42,361
I'll return fast!

1262
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,083
<i>It's gonna be
Lorenzo who's going to win.</i>

1263
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:47,049
<i>He comes through
Woodcote Corner.</i>

1264
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,646
<i>Lorenzo wins
the British Grand Prix.</i>

1265
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:56,811
<i>So, Jorge Lorenzo safely negotiates
the chicane here at Assen</i>

1266
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,611
<i>and wins his fourth
Grand Prix of the season.</i>

1267
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:04,641
<i>Jorge Lorenzo takes his third
victory in succession in MotoGP.</i>

1268
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:09,044
<i>Dani Pedrosa takes second
and Casey Stoner falls to third.</i>

1269
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,686
<i>I have a strange effect.</i>

1270
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,247
<i>I don't have any emotion
to see the race on television.</i>

1271
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,046
<i>It's like something
very far for me.</i>

1272
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,325
<i>I don't expect this. I thought
when I saw the race, I'd say...</i>

1273
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,004
<i>But I was very quiet.</i>

1274
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:29,051
<i>Just thinking of the best way to
recover in a shorter time to be back.</i>

1275
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:33,211
<i>He's using the hyperbaric
chamber, physiotherapy machines</i>

1276
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:38,531
<i>to improve the healing
of the bone.</i>

1277
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:51,284
<i>When you cannot ride the bike,
you are very quiet at home on the sofa.</i>

1278
01:14:51,319 --> 01:14:53,408
<i>But when you say,
"Maybe it's possible, "</i>

1279
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:57,371
<i>you can't stay at home,
you have to try.</i>

1280
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,290
<i>He was like a child,</i>

1281
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:04,967
<i>when you give a present, a gift
to a child at Christmas time,</i>

1282
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,281
<i>he's the same, his face
changed immediately.</i>

1283
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:11,730
<i>Valentino, even after 104
wins, after nine titles,</i>

1284
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:14,089
he really can't wait
to ride a motorcycle.

1285
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,883
<i>Thirty-seven days after the crash,</i>

1286
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,486
<i>Rossi tests a Yamaha
superbike at Brno,</i>

1287
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,566
<i>the day after the World
Superbike races there.</i>

1288
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,331
<i>A superbike is a highly
modified production machine,</i>

1289
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,211
<i>a step down from
a MotoGP prototype,</i>

1290
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:32,170
<i>but still a serious
200 mile-an-hour machine.</i>

1291
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:38,770
<i>He lapped with the same pace
as the previous day's winners.</i>

1292
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:43,327
<i>But if you ask him, he'll say, "Did
you think I wasn't able to do it?"</i>

1293
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,323
I mean,
that's his answer.

1294
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:50,250
<i>And now it's a lot
better already than Misano.</i>

1295
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:56,171
<i>Five days after, we worked a lot in
the gym and in the swimming pool</i>

1296
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:59,011
<i>to improve power
and mobility.</i>

1297
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,684
I have pain, for sure.

1298
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:04,128
I have some problem
after the six, seven laps.

1299
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:08,683
<i>So it will be difficult to do the
long race distances for sure.</i>

1300
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:12,811
<i>When I saw him crash at
Mugello, I seriously thought,</i>

1301
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,684
<i>"Well, that's
the end of him. "</i>

1302
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,888
<i>Any man who has
achieved as much as he,</i>

1303
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,804
<i>who is richer than
you could imagine</i>

1304
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:23,043
<i>and is now under threat
from younger rivals,</i>

1305
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,408
<i>lying there looking at his
shinbone sticking out of his leg.</i>

1306
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,289
<i>Not a pretty sight.</i>

1307
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:31,330
<i>I really thought that we'd
probably seen the last of him.</i>

1308
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,442
<i>And then he made me
look like an absolute idiot</i>

1309
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,249
<i>by coming back
within five weeks.</i>

1310
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:39,729
<i>He's actually nuts about
racing, he's mad about racing.</i>

1311
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,770
<i>There's no other
word to describe it.</i>

1312
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,604
<i>The doctor,
they were all surprised,</i>

1313
01:16:45,639 --> 01:16:47,449
<i>his bone condition
after just 40 days</i>

1314
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:51,643
<i>was like a normal person
in double the time.</i>

1315
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,885
The shoulder
was very painful.

1316
01:16:56,280 --> 01:17:00,683
Five or six hours in the
swimming pool and the gym.

1317
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:03,406
A lot of people
helped me very much.

1318
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,366
Every day
is a small victory.

1319
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,886
It's his heart,
his passion,

1320
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,804
his desire to escape
the monotony of everyday,

1321
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:14,205
<i>to return to the fatal
attraction</i>

1322
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:16,766
<i>of the marvelous world
of motorcycle racing.</i>

1323
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,409
<i>This is the kind of thing that
can turn on you as you get older.</i>

1324
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,811
<i>It's really hard
to stop racing.</i>

1325
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:24,645
<i>You look at the great names
from the recent past,</i>

1326
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:27,803
<i>very few of them have retired
because they thought,</i>

1327
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,962
<i>"I'm getting a bit old now,
and it's a bit silly</i>

1328
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:32,447
<i>"and I've done everything
. There's nothing more to prove."</i>

1329
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:36,002
<i>Very, very few. Agostini's
one very rare example.</i>

1330
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:41,504
<i>Valentino managed to
reconcile me to motorcycles,</i>

1331
01:17:41,539 --> 01:17:45,848
because Graziano had a
very big accident in 1982.

1332
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:51,086
Little by little, Valentino
has revived in me

1333
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:53,527
<i>a great love
for motorcycles.</i>

1334
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:57,810
<i>Now that Valentino has hurt
himself, I'm a little worried.</i>

1335
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,844
Rainey, Schwantz,
Doohan and so on,

1336
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,763
they stopped
because they got hurt.

1337
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:05,891
<i>They were nuts about racing.
It's a fine kind of madness,</i>

1338
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:09,328
<i>quite a potentially self-destructive
kind of madness, too.</i>

1339
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:13,405
Well, his dad was a famous
nutcase who was mad about racing

1340
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,130
and got stopped
by getting hurt.

1341
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,168
<i>Let's hope it doesn't
run in the family.</i>

1342
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:19,971
I stopped for a big,
terrible crash.

1343
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:23,169
<i>I crashed in
Imola in 1982,</i>

1344
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:26,050
<i>260 kilometers
perhouﬂ</i>

1345
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,926
Was not a good
experience.

1346
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:36,085
Dr. Costa said
that I'd probably die,

1347
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:43,127
and then this was not true, and
I have been very, very lucky.

1348
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,325
He was dead.

1349
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:48,091
Graziano Rossi
died in that corner.

1350
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:51,023
<i>Because that corner
was very dangerous,</i>

1351
01:18:51,058 --> 01:18:53,327
<i>I had stationed
a very good doctor there</i>

1352
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:58,726
and he reached him within
seconds and resuscitated him.

1353
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:06,010
<i>In this world, the rider smiles when he
confronts a fatal incident or drama.</i>

1354
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:07,886
<i>That is the beautiful thing,</i>

1355
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:12,249
<i>because life has meaning only
when it stares death in the face.</i>

1356
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,842
That throng of
journalists is all outside

1357
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:26,049
the Fiat/Yamaha
garage. Number 46,

1358
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:29,090
<i>and amazingly, six weeks
later, he's even able to walk,</i>

1359
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:33,250
<i>let alone ride
a 240 horsepower motorcycle.</i>

1360
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:39,605
Valentino wasting no time at all
to put three fastest splits in.

1361
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:44,010
<i>Valentino Rossi top of
the pile by 0-57 of a second-</i>

1362
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,846
<i>Situation
completely normal.</i>

1363
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:53,286
<i>I wondered about the psychology
here, whether Rossi can pressure him</i>

1364
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,966
<i>somehow by coming
back this soon,</i>

1365
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:59,965
<i>or whether Lorenzo is just going
to manage to just shut him out.</i>

1366
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:01,565
<i>Remember in 2006,</i>

1367
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:05,122
<i>when Valentino Rossi was
aboard the yellow Camel Yamaha</i>

1368
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,567
<i>and he had disasters
with engines in Le Mans,</i>

1369
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,722
<i>and he had an engine
blow up at Laguna,</i>

1370
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,929
<i>but by the time we got to the
end of the year in Valencia,</i>

1371
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,729
<i>he was leading the
championship by eight points</i>

1372
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,484
<i>ahead of Nicky Hayden.</i>

1373
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:21,408
<i>Lorenzo leads Rossi by 104
points, more than four race wins.</i>

1374
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:25,408
<i>But this is a sport that sees sudden
and brutal reversals of fortune.</i>

1375
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,520
<i>Who knows?</i>

1376
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:32,322
<i>Maybe Lorenzo will run into the
kind of luck Rossi had in 2006.</i>

1377
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,802
<i>Maybe Rossi still has
a shot at the title.</i>

1378
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:38,605
<i>It's something very,
very difficult,</i>

1379
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:41,883
but it's something that everybody in
the back of his mind is thinking.

1380
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,800
<i>I feel
this bike very well.</i>

1381
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:47,042
<i>I know the limits.
Of course I can crash,</i>

1382
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,406
<i>but I know
the limits very well.</i>

1383
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:57,202
<i>In the end, Rossi is back
because he can be and so he has to be.</i>

1384
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:01,126
<i>This is what he lives for. This
is what they all live for.</i>

1385
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:06,449
<i>One of the big
sensations is driving a bike fast.</i>

1386
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:10,650
I think, second,
only two other things.

1387
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:16,051
Sex and riding,
the best experiences.

1388
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,169
<i>When you feel the bike
and you are confident with it,</i>

1389
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,924
<i>it's fantastic.</i>

1390
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,440
<i>Fantastic sensation.</i>

1391
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:28,361
It's some kind of love.
A strange love, you know.

1392
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,050
<i>Nothing's
even come close to it.</i>

1393
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,771
<i>My whole life's pretty much just
revolved around motorcycles.</i>

1394
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:40,530
<i>I love my bike. I love
the feeling of being on a bike.</i>

1395
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,250
<i>Trying to improve
your riding style.</i>

1396
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:50,250
Racing these machines
against these people,

1397
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,765
<i>that's what I love.</i>

1398
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,282
<i>You zip up the leathers,
put the helmet on,</i>

1399
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,761
<i>walking out to your bike,
you feel complete.</i>

1400
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:01,011
<i>As soon as that shield
goes down, there's nothing.</i>

1401
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:04,170
<i>That's it. It's just done.
You snap the shield shut.</i>

1402
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,927
<i>Let's go as fast
as we possibly can.</i>

1403
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:12,731
<i>Been racing motorcycles for
32 years, since I was four.</i>

1404
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,404
<i>It's been a very
long love affair.</i>

1405
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,603
<i>I started riding bikes
when I was four years old.</i>

1406
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:21,411
This is my
twenty-first season.

1407
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:25,685
<i>When I am home more than one week,
I want to come back and ride.</i>

1408
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:29,483
<i>From the time I was three
years old, been racing motorcycles.</i>

1409
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:33,451
<i>I didn't ever want to be
an astronaut, a fire fighter,</i>

1410
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,888
<i>a footballer, nothing else.
I wanted to be world champion.</i>

1411
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:40,203
<i>When I was four, I was sitting
on Santa Claus' lap and said,</i>

1412
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:42,681
<i>"I want a motorcycle. "
And then his reaction was,</i>

1413
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:46,287
<i>"Well, you can't do this."
And I totally just walked off</i>

1414
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,089
and didn't even listen
to what he had to say,

1415
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:49,889
'cause he didn't have
a motorcycle for me.

1416
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,446
<i>And then I got a motorcycle
when I was five.</i>

1417
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,807
<i>And started racing street
bikes when I was eight.</i>

1418
01:22:55,280 --> 01:23:01,162
<i>I was three years old the first
time I got onto a bike, I realized that</i>

1419
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:02,810
<i>it was my sport.</i>

1420
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,451
<i>My dad was convinced
I could be a world champion.</i>

1421
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,488
<i>Since the beginning,
since I was three years old.</i>

1422
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:10,166
<i>He was talking
about that with people</i>

1423
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:13,449
<i>and people thought
that he was mad,</i>

1424
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,090
<i>completely mad.</i>

1425
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:18,209
<i>It's usually the father
who supports his son's ambition.</i>

1426
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,805
<i>But there's always
the exception.</i>

1427
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:23,602
<i>Well, my mom was the one that
had the $80,000 credit card bills,</i>

1428
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:26,206
<i>working three jobs,
doing that kind of stuff.</i>

1429
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:28,091
<i>We knew when
he was three years old.</i>

1430
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,527
<i>When he was 12, I knew he
was going to be a champion.</i>

1431
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,364
<i>Told so many people.</i>

1432
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:35,171
<i>So far this year,
Mary Spies has watched her son</i>

1433
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,009
<i>crash twice in France,</i>

1434
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:40,050
<i>retire in Spain
and finish seventh in Italy.</i>

1435
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,603
<i>Ben said it's gonna
be a different ball game.</i>

1436
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:45,445
<i>And just hang in there and
we'll take it step by step-</i>

1437
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:49,046
<i>He crashed again
in practice in Britain.</i>

1438
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,601
<i>And then racing with
a broken bone in his foot,</i>

1439
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,126
<i>he shows everyone
what he's made of.</i>

1440
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,771
<i>Inside line
as they go down towards Abbey.</i>

1441
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,330
<i>Ben Spies now
on the outside.</i>

1442
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,243
<i>Can he find some way
through at Farm Curve?</i>

1443
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,846
<i>There you see, and Spies
is gonna go through.</i>

1444
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:03,940
<i>How much longer?</i>

1445
01:24:03,975 --> 01:24:04,961
Halfa lap.

1446
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:11,127
<i>Dovizioso's second.
Ben Spies in third place.</i>

1447
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:12,850
Got it.
He got third.

1448
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,970
Bravo!

1449
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,567
<i>That's his life, and
he can do whatever he wants</i>

1450
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,085
<i>and I will support him.</i>

1451
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,121
<i>The other man on fire
at this point of the season</i>

1452
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,964
<i>is Frenchman
Randy de Puniet,</i>

1453
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:34,284
<i>who has qualified on the front
row at the last three races,</i>

1454
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,846
<i>second only
to Lorenzo and Stoner.</i>

1455
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:39,881
<i>Like Spies, de Puniet
is in the satellite team,</i>

1456
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,328
<i>racing a second-best bike.</i>

1457
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,562
<i>Only the top teams get
the latest equipment,</i>

1458
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,928
<i>an unfair fact
of MotoGP life.</i>

1459
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:54,285
<i>De Puniet's ultra-fast qualifying
laps are a tribute to his bra very.</i>

1460
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,370
<i>And perhaps also to the
testosterone boosting powers</i>

1461
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:00,171
<i>of his Australian girlfriend,
Lauren Vickers.</i>

1462
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:03,724
<i>But it's very, very hard
to maintain that level</i>

1463
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:06,406
<i>of over-the-limit commitment
for an entire race.</i>

1464
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,490
I don't like to see that
so much, the crashes,

1465
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,530
<i>but when he's on a high, it's really
amazing to be able to watch him.</i>

1466
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,762
Yeah, I feel okay because
it's my riding style.

1467
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:18,451
And it was the only
chance to be fast.

1468
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,451
Sure, my bike was a little
bit difficult to control.

1469
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:25,330
But it was no problem because I
am in good physical condition,

1470
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,641
and I was ready for that.

1471
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,044
<i>It's another
good lap by Rossi.</i>

1472
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,691
<i>Will it lift him out of fifth place?
It does. Up to fourth.</i>

1473
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:36,923
<i>He's getting nearer and nearer
to that front row start.</i>

1474
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:40,529
<i>Fire out of the side
of Jorge Lorenzo's bike.</i>

1475
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,648
<i>Fuel off the left
hand side of the bike.</i>

1476
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,245
<i>Oil spitting out
of the bike.</i>

1477
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:45,241
<i>Pouring out.</i>

1478
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,928
<i>There he is. Oil spurting
out of his bike.</i>

1479
01:25:48,963 --> 01:25:51,446
<i>All the way down
towards Turn 1.</i>

1480
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,602
<i>Ben Spies has gone down.</i>

1481
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:55,489
<i>Hey, there's someone
else there as well.</i>

1482
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,925
<i>Is that
Randy de Puniet?</i>

1483
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,286
<i>Yeah.
It's de Puniet down.</i>

1484
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:59,441
<i>Red flag out.</i>

1485
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,171
<i>Oil on the track,
de Puniet looks hurt.</i>

1486
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:11,286
<i>Jorge Lorenzo is confirmed
as being on pole position.</i>

1487
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:14,011
<i>The Spaniard just nipping
ahead of Casey Stoner.</i>

1488
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,162
<i>And Dani Pedrosa
rounding out the first row.</i>

1489
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:19,210
<i>Row two, Dovizioso backing
up Pedrosa's speed.</i>

1490
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,611
<i>Valentino Ross:
he returns-</i>

1491
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:22,887
<i>Row three, headed
by Randy de Puniet.</i>

1492
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:27,090
<i>Let's hope he's okay for tomorrow's
Grand Prix after the crash.</i>

1493
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:39,646
<i>Jorge Lorenzo in pole.</i>

1494
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:42,849
<i>Casey Stoner, he goes
to Honda next season.</i>

1495
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:49,369
<i>Behind them, look out for the return
of The Doctor, Valentino Rossi.</i>

1496
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:52,728
<i>Valentino Rossi hasn't ruled out
challenging for this championship.</i>

1497
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:07,371
<i>Round eight of the
MotoGP World Championship</i>

1498
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,886
<i>here at the Sachsenring
is underway.</i>

1499
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:14,646
<i>The race is scheduled for
30 laps of the 2. 2-mile circuit.</i>

1500
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,285
<i>Sachsenring is unusual</i>

1501
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:20,921
<i>because it has 10 left
and only three right turns.</i>

1502
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,684
<i>The layout helps Rossi.</i>

1503
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:25,491
<i>His injuries are to his right
leg and right shoulder,</i>

1504
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:28,484
<i>and the track places the load on the
stronger left side of his body.</i>

1505
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,961
<i>Nine laps in, Lorenzo leads from
Pedrosa, Stoner and Dovizioso.</i>

1506
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:39,089
<i>Rossi is in fifth place
when the crash happens.</i>

1507
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:50,241
<i>De Puniet falls first and is struck
by the Ducati of Mika Kallio.</i>

1508
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:53,324
<i>Bautista and Espargaro
hit de Puniet's bike.</i>

1509
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:09,888
<i>De Puniet's injuries,
a broken tibia and fibula,</i>

1510
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:11,928
<i>like Rossi at Mugello.</i>

1511
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,283
<i>The race is restarted.</i>

1512
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,844
<i>Pedrosa takes the lead
from Lorenzo in lap 10</i>

1513
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:26,890
<i>and edges away to win
by three seconds.</i>

1514
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:29,008
<i>The real battle
is behind them.</i>

1515
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:31,560
<i>Casey Stoner and Valentino
Rossi fight it out</i>

1516
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,563
<i>for the final place
on the podium.</i>

1517
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:35,529
<i>And it will all
be down to the final lap</i>

1518
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,090
<i>for the battle
for the podium position.</i>

1519
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:38,685
<i>Rossi will be
desperate for it.</i>

1520
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,768
<i>Stoner desperate
to hang onto it.</i>

1521
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:45,202
<i>Look how wide
Stoner has gone.</i>

1522
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:48,807
<i>He's gonna try and get the
drive going down to 14.</i>

1523
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:53,766
<i>Stoner's going to come in. It's
the final corner in attack.</i>

1524
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,241
<i>Stoner goes through
into 14.</i>

1525
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,891
<i>Across the line,
it's Stoner.</i>

1526
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:04,404
<i>You know, I'm sure
from Casey's perspective,</i>

1527
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,403
<i>there was extra
effort put in</i>

1528
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,927
<i>to not get beaten by a guy
with a broken leg.</i>

1529
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,283
<i>Overall, I think being
a left-hand track</i>

1530
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,010
<i>may not be too difficult
on the leg.</i>

1531
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,401
<i>You obviously don't get any
rest at all at Laguna.</i>

1532
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:30,203
<i>I suffered quite
a lot in Turn 4 and Turn 5,</i>

1533
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:33,521
<i>for changing direction
from right to left</i>

1534
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,001
<i>and also braking
for the turnpike.</i>

1535
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,923
<i>It's a hard
sport, physically.</i>

1536
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,843
<i>You are getting
tired in the race.</i>

1537
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:44,926
<i>You are moving your body and have
a lot of force to move this bike.</i>

1538
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,729
<i>And also to go down at
the Corkscrew, I have some pain.</i>

1539
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,565
<i>So in that change of direction,
I was not strong enough.</i>

1540
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:55,326
<i>In the race,
Pedrosa leads Lorenzo again.</i>

1541
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,129
<i>But this time,
he cracks under pressure.</i>

1542
01:29:57,200 --> 01:30:00,363
<i>Crash! Dani Pedrosa!
Dani Pedrosa has crashed out,</i>

1543
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:04,286
<i>leading all the way
in this race so far.</i>

1544
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:08,445
<i>Rossi finds himself in a
last-lap battle with Andrea Dovizioso.</i>

1545
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:12,570
<i>This time, he wins.</i>

1546
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,362
<i>He's back on the podium.</i>

1547
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,770
<i>But his teammate
is on the top step.</i>

1548
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,001
<i>He has a serenity.</i>

1549
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:27,244
<i>Very mature, measured, careful
races he's had all this year,</i>

1550
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:29,084
<i>with or without
Rossi there.</i>

1551
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:33,167
<i>He did a great job,
so great congratulations to him,</i>

1552
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:37,649
and he's in front every practice
and in every condition.

1553
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,643
So he's in great,
great shape.

1554
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:43,805
<i>I think he deserves the championship,
without my injury, my crash.</i>

1555
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:46,087
<i>You cannot say nothing
to a rider that...</i>

1556
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:47,810
<i>The worst result
is second, so...</i>

1557
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:52,970
<i>In 2009, Valentino Rossi
said he expected to stay at Yamaha</i>

1558
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,929
<i>until the end
of his career.</i>

1559
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,324
<i>At Laguna Seca, it's announced that
he will race for Ducati in 2011.</i>

1560
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:04,248
<i>One year ago, I think
that I finish my career with Yamaha.</i>

1561
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,722
<i>But after, inside of Yamaha,
a lot of things changed.</i>

1562
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:12,365
<i>Yamaha have hired somebody
who is not just as fast as him,</i>

1563
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:14,090
<i>but frequently
faster than him,</i>

1564
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:18,043
<i>and more distressingly for
Rossi, a great deal younger.</i>

1565
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:20,682
<i>I think we've got
to wait till 2016</i>

1566
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:23,240
before we can make
a determination on that,

1567
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:27,006
because that's when he'd have had
the opportunity to win as many

1568
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:29,851
<i>MotoGP Championships
as Valentino has.</i>

1569
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:33,001
<i>At the next race
in the Czech Republic,</i>

1570
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:35,965
<i>Rossi is on course for a
front row starting position</i>

1571
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:38,520
<i>when he crashes in the final
corner of his fastest lap.</i>

1572
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:42,489
<i>He escapes without injury.</i>

1573
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:45,283
<i>He finishes fifth
in the race.</i>

1574
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:47,770
<i>Lorenzo wins.</i>

1575
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:51,211
<i>Two weeks later in sweltering
heat in Indianapolis,</i>

1576
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:54,407
<i>Rossi crashes again
in practice.</i>

1577
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:57,161
<i>And again.</i>

1578
01:31:58,920 --> 01:31:59,921
<i>And again.</i>

1579
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:05,203
<i>When he came back, we thought
that maybe in two or three races,</i>

1580
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:06,520
<i>he would have been 100%.</i>

1581
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,443
<i>Now we realize that
it's not like that.</i>

1582
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:11,604
<i>In a normal condition,
you fully dominate your bike,</i>

1583
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:13,131
<i>like you are in control.</i>

1584
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:17,122
<i>Probably now, he is not in control.
He has a lack of power.</i>

1585
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,771
<i>After a disappointing
sixth at Laguna Seca,</i>

1586
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:25,966
<i>Ben Spies rises to the occasion on
his return to his home country.</i>

1587
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,723
<i>He qualifies on pole and
takes second in the race.</i>

1588
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:34,251
<i>It was a perfect weekend for me.
We didn't win the race,</i>

1589
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,402
<i>but in a rookie season,
satellite bike,</i>

1590
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:38,443
<i>you can't ask for
a whole lot more.</i>

1591
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:43,967
<i>Dani Pedrosa wins,
Lorenzo is third, Rossi fourth.</i>

1592
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,364
<i>You can't bet
against Valentino.</i>

1593
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:48,329
<i>You know,
Valentino is Valentino.</i>

1594
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:50,762
<i>But there is always
a changing of the guard.</i>

1595
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:53,204
<i>Valentino
said it best himself.</i>

1596
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:56,211
<i>"The young sharks smell
blood, " and they did.</i>

1597
01:32:56,440 --> 01:33:01,162
And that aura of invincibility
of Valentino's has been broken.

1598
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:05,245
Now, can he repair that?

1599
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:12,283
<i>Rossi wears a special
helmet for his home race in Misano,</i>

1600
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:15,131
<i>telling himself to wake up
as the hour approaches.</i>

1601
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:18,569
I feel better
with my leg,

1602
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:21,689
but unfortunately, this racetrack
is very demanding for the shoulder,

1603
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:25,481
<i>because it has three
hard braking on the right.</i>

1604
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:29,360
<i>The whole structure of
the shoulder was damaged,</i>

1605
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:35,721
<i>the socket, ligaments,
muscles, cartilage.</i>

1606
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:39,042
<i>I think there's
a particular angle it's fine,</i>

1607
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:41,600
<i>and another angle,
it's very weak.</i>

1608
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:43,761
<i>Braking.</i>

1609
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:47,049
<i>At the end of the straight,
under hard braking.</i>

1610
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:50,767
<i>The maximum G-force
you can have is 2.5G.</i>

1611
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:52,487
<i>The word is that his team</i>

1612
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,642
<i>is trying to make the bike
easier for him to ride.</i>

1613
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:56,886
<i>At the end of the day,</i>

1614
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:00,201
<i>if you can make
the bike easier to ride,</i>

1615
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,721
why wouldn't you make it easier
to ride for a fit person?

1616
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:06,648
<i>It's impossible. It's impossible
to make the bike easy to ride.</i>

1617
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,407
<i>If he had lots of strength, we
could make the bike good for braking,</i>

1618
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:11,845
<i>which is a strength of his.</i>

1619
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:14,645
<i>But when he became tired
or weak with his shoulder,</i>

1620
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,083
<i>then we had to slightly move
the setting away from braking</i>

1621
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:21,323
<i>and more towards
sort of help it turn.</i>

1622
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:24,802
<i>We try to make a bike
easier to stop from braking,</i>

1623
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,930
<i>but, you know, when you have
a good bike in braking,</i>

1624
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,048
<i>then you have a bike
that doesn't turn well,</i>

1625
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:34,370
you create some benefit, but you
create a lot of negative also.

1626
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:40,204
This problem has been the
story of all this year.

1627
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:44,526
Valentino Rossi heads
the second row of the grid.

1628
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:47,251
He is the reigning
MotoGP World Champion.

1629
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:50,125
<i>And the time is
coming up to 2:00.</i>

1630
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:52,730
<i>It's time,
Valentino, to wake up.</i>

1631
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:59,888
<i>And for those Valentino
Rossi fan club members,</i>

1632
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:03,249
<i>it's time for Valentino Rossi
to win another Grand Prix.</i>

1633
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:06,290
<i>The last time that Valentino
Rossi won a Grand Prix</i>

1634
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:09,370
<i>was April 11th,
it's now September 5th.</i>

1635
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:10,521
<i>What is going on?</i>

1636
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:47,321
<i>In front of his adoring
fans, Rossi does the best he can,</i>

1637
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:50,724
<i>fighting off Casey Stoner
and Andrea Dovizioso</i>

1638
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:54,686
<i>for third place behind Jorge Lorenzo
and race winner Dani Pedrosa,</i>

1639
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:59,522
<i>who is now the only man with a hope
of challenging Lorenzo for the title.</i>

1640
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:09,204
<i>Valentino is like the conductor of an
orchestra, coordinating the rhythm,</i>

1641
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:13,205
<i>the sound and the movement
of the motorcycle.</i>

1642
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:17,888
<i>He has always been beautiful to
watch on a motorcycle, but now</i>

1643
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:22,690
with the shoulder injury,
his style is not so flowing.

1644
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:31,163
<i>In Aragon, at the
13th Grand Prix of the season,</i>

1645
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:34,161
<i>Casey Stoner wins for the
first time this year.</i>

1646
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:37,210
<i>And for the first
time this year,</i>

1647
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,760
<i>Jorge Lorenzo fails
to get on the podium.</i>

1648
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:43,127
<i>He finishes fourth,
behind Nicky Hayden.</i>

1649
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,843
<i>Dani Pedrosa is second,</i>

1650
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:50,363
<i>narrowing the gap to Lorenzo to
56 points with five races to go,</i>

1651
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:54,205
<i>125 points
still up for grabs.</i>

1652
01:36:57,080 --> 01:37:00,163
<i>Aragon is Valentino Rossi's
worst finish this year.</i>

1653
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,001
<i>Sixth.</i>

1654
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:11,401
<i>My throttle kept open
when I was going to brake.</i>

1655
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:17,204
<i>So I was braking, trying to
brake, but with the throttle off,</i>

1656
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:20,648
my bike was full open
and I crashed.

1657
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:23,849
We had a technical
problem on the bike.

1658
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:28,528
And he couldn't control it
and he crashed so bad,

1659
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:32,002
<i>because I think he didn't
expect at that moment anything,</i>

1660
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,651
<i>and he fell really hard
on his left shoulder</i>

1661
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,290
<i>and he broke
the collarbone.</i>

1662
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:39,564
<i>It seems to have been an
assembly fault, a mechanic's error,</i>

1663
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:41,804
<i>and it cost him
everything.</i>

1664
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,087
<i>In the last five years,
he's always been the runner-up,</i>

1665
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:48,881
or second or third.
Finally, to be the champion,

1666
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:51,811
everything has to be
there for you that time.

1667
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,049
<i>And it hasn't been
there for him.</i>

1668
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:56,566
<i>We can only keep trying,
and looking for it</i>

1669
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:59,604
and believing in
it the way we do.

1670
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:03,401
Because if you don't believe,
there's no meaning to do nothing.

1671
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:09,043
<i>My dream is to become,
one day, MotoGP World Champion,</i>

1672
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,930
at least one title
in MotoGP.

1673
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,770
That would
make me very happy.

1674
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:21,324
If not, maybe it's because
I wasn't good enough,

1675
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:24,882
but I know I'm putting
everything here

1676
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:26,805
to make it happen.

1677
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:30,361
<i>The moment that
Dani Pedrosa hit the ground,</i>

1678
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:33,649
<i>the 2010 MotoGP World
Championship was over.</i>

1679
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,162
<i>His collarbone is
not simply broken,</i>

1680
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:39,686
<i>it's shattered
into several pieces.</i>

1681
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:42,162
<i>He's flown back
to Spain for surgery.</i>

1682
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:50,050
<i>Officially, Jorge Lorenzo
needs another 19 points</i>

1683
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:52,566
<i>to put the title beyond
Dani Pedrosa's reach.</i>

1684
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:54,690
<i>But Pedrosa will
not be fit enough</i>

1685
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:56,489
<i>to win any more
races this year.</i>

1686
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:01,010
<i>Lorenzo can clinch the world title if
he finishes first or second in Japan.</i>

1687
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:04,083
<i>He'll have to get past
his teammate to do this.</i>

1688
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:07,241
<i>That was very brave,
wasn't it, from Lorenzo,</i>

1689
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:10,449
<i>round the outside
of Valentino Ross:</i>

1690
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:17,407
<i>And Lorenzo trying to find the
inside of Valentino Rossi.</i>

1691
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:19,464
<i>He's got it.
Can Rossi retake him?</i>

1692
01:39:19,499 --> 01:39:21,369
<i>And he's gonna
love doing that.</i>

1693
01:39:21,404 --> 01:39:23,681
<i>Back through at Turn 5.</i>

1694
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:29,844
<i>We still have to see Lorenzo
under pressure, with the injury of Vale,</i>

1695
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,081
<i>by the half of season,</i>

1696
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:33,686
<i>he had quite a big gap
in the championship.</i>

1697
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:37,281
<i>Here comes Lorenzo,</i>

1698
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,886
<i>he almost does take
Rossi's leg off now.</i>

1699
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:43,123
<i>Can Rossi react again?
Going down towards Turn 5.</i>

1700
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:47,330
<i>They're side by side in the tunnel
and Rossi returned the favor.</i>

1701
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:50,931
<i>Can Lorenzo stick it around
the outside of him,</i>

1702
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:53,088
<i>in towards the S-curve,
he's gonna try it.</i>

1703
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:55,641
<i>On the inside now,
very hard stuff.</i>

1704
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:58,246
<i>Eight turns going around
there, Rossi on the inside...</i>

1705
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,687
<i>Valentino still
has this aura about him</i>

1706
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:04,569
<i>if it comes down
to a last-lap fight,</i>

1707
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:07,687
<i>that he is not beaten
and will not be beaten.</i>

1708
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:12,208
<i>Now, can he go around
the outside another time?</i>

1709
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:13,361
<i>He loves that maneuver.</i>

1710
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:15,847
<i>Here he comes once more,
in towards the S-curve,</i>

1711
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,127
<i>and this time he will
go in front once more.</i>

1712
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:29,965
<i>Can Rossi react
to the left hand...</i>

1713
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:31,485
<i>He's gonna try...</i>

1714
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:36,088
<i>It's the block pass, isn't
it, from Valentino Ross:</i>

1715
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:38,840
<i>Valentino beat him up
good and proper, totally fairly.</i>

1716
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:41,964
<i>Good close racing, but it
was no mercy to a teammate</i>

1717
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:44,367
<i>who's getting close
to a world championship.</i>

1718
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:49,370
<i>Rossi has held him off
for the final podium position,</i>

1719
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:51,621
<i>but delight
for Ducati and Stoner,</i>

1720
01:40:51,656 --> 01:40:53,762
<i>he wins the
Japanese Grand Prix!</i>

1721
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,251
<i>Brilliant performance!</i>

1722
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:58,087
<i>Second place,
Andrea Dovizioso.</i>

1723
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:02,247
<i>In third place is
Valentino Ross:</i>

1724
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:06,083
<i>Jorge Lorenzo
must wait another week</i>

1725
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:08,322
<i>before he can get his hands
on Rossi's crown.</i>

1726
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:14,442
<i>He's where he should be.
He's in pole position,</i>

1727
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:16,409
<i>his sixth pole
of the season,</i>

1728
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:18,290
<i>eight Grand Prix wins</i>

1729
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:23,686
<i>before the start of the most
important race of his life.</i>

1730
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:37,645
<i>The Grand Prix of Malaysia,
Lorenzo leads the way.</i>

1731
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,727
<i>I remember
when I was 16,</i>

1732
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,526
<i>I was so ingenuous
about everything,</i>

1733
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:46,245
<i>I didn't get any result,</i>

1734
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:50,166
<i>and this world of the
motorcycle, for me, was so big,</i>

1735
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:52,242
<i>and I was so small.</i>

1736
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:55,524
<i>So I had a lot of pressure
to make good race.</i>

1737
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:59,127
<i>I crashed many times,
making some mistakes,</i>

1738
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:02,282
<i>but, you know, fortunately,
you get better.</i>

1739
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:09,202
<i>Jorge Lorenzo will be
crowned the 2010 World Champion.</i>

1740
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:15,282
<i>He finishes third
in the race. He's done it.</i>

1741
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,480
<i>Twenty years after
he first rode a motorcycle,</i>

1742
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:27,530
<i>just as his father predicted,</i>

1743
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,288
<i>Jorge Lorenzo is
MotoGP World Champion.</i>

1744
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:54,369
<i>That day in Malaysia, at the
same time, in the same place,</i>

1745
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:56,326
<i>there is another race.</i>

1746
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:03,128
<i>Between 2004 and 2010,</i>

1747
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:06,928
<i>Valentino Rossi has won
45 races for Yamaha.</i>

1748
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:11,400
<i>When I arrive at 45,
I say, "I have to do 46. "</i>

1749
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:13,404
<i>It's Lorenzo
around the outside.</i>

1750
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,602
<i>Look out for Casey
Stoner on the inside,</i>

1751
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:17,131
<i>and Ben Spies as well.</i>

1752
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:20,530
<i>Stoner up into third, but
where is Valentino Rossi?</i>

1753
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:21,761
<i>He's way, way back.</i>

1754
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:23,484
<i>He's right down
the order.</i>

1755
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:26,723
<i>Absolute disaster
for Valentino Ross:</i>

1756
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:28,924
<i>He's not in the top 10.</i>

1757
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:34,007
<i>We seem to have lost Casey Stoner.
Where's he gone?</i>

1758
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:36,600
<i>In that final corner,
Stoner's gone down.</i>

1759
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:38,723
<i>Stoner out of the race.</i>

1760
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:41,730
<i>He's won the last two races,
he's not gonna win this one.</i>

1761
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,490
<i>Where is Valentino Rossi?</i>

1762
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:46,609
<i>Up into eighth position now,
ahead of Loris Capirossi.</i>

1763
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:49,807
<i>There's Rossi,
come from a long way back,</i>

1764
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:53,004
<i>try and fight through on the
inside of Colin Edwards.</i>

1765
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:01,047
<i>He really, really means
business this afternoon.</i>

1766
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:02,485
<i>He wants the battle,
doesn't he?</i>

1767
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,483
<i>And there's the man who
will be taking his seat</i>

1768
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:07,609
<i>at the Fiat Yamaha
team next year, Ben Spies.</i>

1769
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:09,848
<i>And no way for Spies
to fightback.</i>

1770
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:11,729
<i>On board now with
Valentino Rossi,</i>

1771
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:14,610
<i>the fastest rider on the
circuit at the moment.</i>

1772
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:19,005
<i>He desperately wanted
the 46th win on a Yamaha.</i>

1773
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:21,401
<i>He was in bad shape,
but he fought for it.</i>

1774
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:24,241
<i>Pulls up into fourth
now, past Nicky Hayden.</i>

1775
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:26,328
<i>Marco Simoncelli
having a great race.</i>

1776
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:27,731
<i>He's thrown
Hayden as well.</i>

1777
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:31,686
<i>Valentino Rossi closing
right up now on Marco Simoncelli.</i>

1778
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:35,685
<i>Rossi comes so, so late,
taken third place.</i>

1779
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:44,565
<i>Into Turn 1, Andrea Dovizioso
takes over the lead in the race</i>

1780
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:46,927
<i>and runs Lorenzo
slightly wide.</i>

1781
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:51,364
<i>Rossi is just under 02:02:01,
almost half a second quicker.</i>

1782
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:57,202
<i>Rossi on the inside,</i>

1783
01:44:57,480 --> 01:45:01,530
<i>how much distance between those
two bikes as Rossi comes through.</i>

1784
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:11,605
<i>Lorenzo runs in a little
bit wide at Turn 1.</i>

1785
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:14,481
<i>Here comes Rossi
down into Turn 9.</i>

1786
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:17,484
<i>Dovizioso running
very wide there.</i>

1787
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:25,485
<i>Here comes Dovizioso,
down into Turn 1.</i>

1788
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:28,325
<i>And Dovizioso takes over
at the front once more,</i>

1789
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,442
<i>and Rossi fighting back.</i>

1790
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:46,647
<i>Here comes Rossi on the
inside, he's done it again.</i>

1791
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:48,131
<i>He's back in front.</i>

1792
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:55,082
<i>It's something incredible,
that after seven seasons,</i>

1793
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:59,250
<i>I do exactly 46 victories
with Yamaha.</i>

1794
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:01,800
<i>It's something maybe written
in the destiny, you know?</i>

1795
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:05,089
<i>Valentino Rossi wins
the Malaysian Grand Prix.</i>

1796
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:10,083
<i>After all the broken leg,
the shoulder injuries,</i>

1797
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:12,084
<i>Rossi is back.</i>

1798
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:29,205
<i>It was great- Also I prefer to
win 47, 48 or 49, but not less than 46-</i>

1799
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:37,808
<i>Valentino Rossi rounds off
the season with three podium finishes</i>

1800
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:40,487
<i>and third place overall
in the championship.</i>

1801
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:45,842
<i>He bids farewell to Yamaha in
a letter to his beloved bike.</i>

1802
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,207
Many things have changed since
that far-off time in 2004

1803
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:51,682
when my M1 and I kissed for the
first time on the grass at Welkom,

1804
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:54,849
when she looked straight in my
eyes and told me, "I love you!"

1805
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:03,207
<i>Rossi inherits Stoner's
volatile Ducati for 2011.</i>

1806
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:11,528
<i>He has an operation
to repair his shoulder</i>

1807
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:14,531
<i>after a first test,
where he was 15th fastest.</i>

1808
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:16,809
<i>I have a bad
problem with the shoulder,</i>

1809
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:18,848
<i>so I don't understand
the bike very well.</i>

1810
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,650
<i>Now I make the surgery.</i>

1811
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:24,762
<i>It's a question of getting
the fitness back into Valentino.</i>

1812
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:27,850
<i>The development and the setting for
him will come more quickly then.</i>

1813
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:31,406
Valentino still has many
things to do in motorcycling.

1814
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:34,520
<i>Now, it's like
I am 10 years younger, no?</i>

1815
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:37,524
<i>Because it's a new adventure
starting from the beginning.</i>

1816
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:42,011
<i>It's a great emotion,
it's like we start from zero.</i>

1817
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:45,084
<i>So, I hope to do this
for some other seasons.</i>

1818
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:50,961
<i>How many more races? How
many more championships can he win?</i>

1819
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:53,884
<i>Back in 1977,</i>

1820
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:57,409
<i>Giacomo Agostini walked away
from Grand Prix racing</i>

1821
01:47:57,560 --> 01:48:01,246
<i>after 14 seasons,
unscathed and untouchable.</i>

1822
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:05,080
<i>In 2012, as he chases
Agostini's record</i>

1823
01:48:05,115 --> 01:48:07,881
<i>of eight premier class
championships</i>

1824
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:10,731
<i>and 122
Grand Prix victories,</i>

1825
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:14,966
<i>Valentino Rossi will be entering
his 17th year in MotoGP.</i>

1826
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:19,842
<i>But for every year that you push your
bike and your body to the limit,</i>

1827
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:22,162
<i>you push your luck
to the limit as well.</i>

1828
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,764
<i>You can't be
the fastest forever.</i>

1829
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:29,282
<i>And when the red lights go
out, nobody's looking back.</i>

1830
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:32,130
<i>The past is behind you.</i>

1831
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:33,770
<i>And there's only
one question.</i>

1832
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:37,851
<i>Who's fastest now?</i>

1833
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,079
